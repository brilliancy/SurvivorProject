191,00:12:28.62,00:12:33.08,that final bag.Puzzle takes a long time.
192,00:12:33.08,00:12:36.67,"Don't give up, Taj, don't giveup, Erinn."
193,00:12:36.67,00:12:43.58,This is big-time immunity.You do not want to go to Tribal
194,00:12:43.58,00:12:47.25,Council tonight withoutimmunity.
195,00:12:47.25,00:12:50.25,Taj through with her third bag.Erinn through with her third
196,00:12:50.25,00:12:57.58,bag.J.T. has had a nice head start.
197,00:12:57.58,00:13:00.58,Stephen's had a pretty goodamount of time.
198,00:13:00.58,00:13:07.33,Erinn is the last to get here.There will be one piece in the
199,00:13:07.33,00:13:10.42,"center, then two pieces in thesecond row, three pieces in the"
200,00:13:10.42,00:13:19.71,"third row, always.Stephen proved earlier he is a"
201,00:13:19.71,00:13:24.50,wiz with numbers.Does that hold true for puzzles?
202,00:13:27.46,00:13:31.50,J.T. getting closer.Only five pieces left for J.T.
203,00:13:31.50,00:13:34.104,if he has them in the rightspot.
204,00:13:39.04,00:13:42.62,Erinn making up a lot of groundnow.
205,00:13:42.62,00:13:47.42,Erinn was the last person tostart working on her puzzle.
206,00:13:47.42,00:13:52.17,Taj starting to fall behind now.Stephen still fighting to stay
207,00:13:52.17,00:13:55.71,"in this.Right now, it is between J.T.,"
208,00:13:55.71,00:14:03.25,"Stephen and Erinn.J.T. down to one piece left, but"
209,00:14:03.25,00:14:10.12,he can't find a spot for it.He's got one in the wrong spot.
210,00:14:10.12,00:14:14.58,Erinn has closed the gap now.It is Erinn and J.T.
211,00:14:14.58,00:14:27.12,(J.T. groans)>> Yes.
212,00:14:27.12,00:14:30.21,>> PROBST: J.T. wins immunity!(Stephen groans)
213,00:14:30.21,00:14:34.29,">> I am so close.All right, J."
214,00:14:34.29,00:14:41.88,"Oh, man.>> PROBST: J.T., once again,"
215,00:14:41.88,00:14:46.08,back-to-back.Nice job.
216,00:14:46.08,00:14:48.83,">> Whoo-hoo!>> PROBST: Once again, J.T. is"
217,00:14:48.83,00:14:53.25,"safe at Tribal Council.Tonight, Erinn, Stephen, Taj,"
218,00:14:53.25,00:14:56.08,it's been 37 days.That will be all it is for one
219,00:14:56.08,00:14:57.54,"of you.Grab your stuff, head back to"
220,00:14:57.54,00:15:01.12,camp.See you at Tribal.
221,00:15:01.12,00:15:03.42,">> I had it.I got my last pieces out, ready"
222,00:15:03.42,00:15:06.25,"to put them into the very, verylast one."
223,00:15:06.25,00:15:10.21,J.T. won immunity.Frustrating to no end.
224,00:15:10.21,00:15:12.88,I am sitting next to threepeople who have been together
225,00:15:12.88,00:15:17.12,"since day one, and I am veryaware that they could just take"
226,00:15:17.12,00:15:45.29,me out and keep Taj.>> Congratulations.
227,00:15:45.29,00:15:48.08,>> Thanks.>> Nice job.
228,00:15:48.08,00:15:53.83,>> Work well done.>> It was a close one.
229,00:15:53.83,00:15:56.04,">> It was a close one.>> Well, J.T. wins immunity"
230,00:15:56.04,00:15:58.46,"today.Any one of the Jalapao members,"
231,00:15:58.46,00:16:01.46,"had they won, it would haveworked in our favor, and the"
232,00:16:01.46,00:16:04.46,plan is to vote for Erinnbecause Jalapao is Jalapao the
233,00:16:04.46,00:16:07.25,"three, and as long as we stayloyal, we can go to the final"
234,00:16:07.25,00:16:10.71,three together.>> Let's get in that water.
235,00:16:10.71,00:16:13.67,>> I'm not getting in the water.It's going to burn so bad.
236,00:16:13.67,00:16:15.54,"Erinn, I'm sure she's vying fora spot."
237,00:16:15.54,00:16:18.08,She's gonna be trying toconvince them that she's worthy
238,00:16:18.08,00:16:22.88,of being here.But I want her to realize that
239,00:16:22.88,00:16:26.21,she can try all day long.The guys are loyal to me until
240,00:16:26.21,00:16:29.62,"the final three, and, and we gotto move on like that."
241,00:16:29.62,00:16:32.54,">> I got to ease in before I--well, actually, coming over and"
242,00:16:32.54,00:16:35.46,sitting down would be the sameas easing in.
243,00:16:35.46,00:16:40.42,You know how I don't like to doit all at once.
244,00:16:40.42,00:16:45.12,"Coming back from the challenge,all I'm thinking about is, like,"
245,00:16:45.12,00:16:48.08,what's my next move?How am I going to plead my case?
246,00:16:48.08,00:16:52.17,"What do I do, what do I say?I don't want to make it seem as"
247,00:16:52.17,00:16:55.25,though I'm scrambling.I'm just going to say my piece.
248,00:16:55.25,00:16:58.46,I think Taj-- she has playedsuch a good social game.
249,00:16:58.46,00:17:03.08,"Like, she has made really goodfriends with everyone, and I"
250,00:17:03.08,00:17:08.08,"mean, she definitely played agreat game, aside from just,"
251,00:17:08.08,00:17:12.21,"like, being very likable.>> Uh-huh."
252,00:17:12.21,00:17:16.25,>> And I totally think she couldwin.
253,00:17:16.25,00:17:19.08,">> Erinn's really playing hergame down at the water, and she"
254,00:17:19.08,00:17:21.71,made a good point.Taj has a very good chance of
255,00:17:21.71,00:17:24.42,beating me when the jury votes'cause everyone loves Taj.
256,00:17:24.42,00:17:27.04,">> Ay, ay, ay.>> This is a game for a million"
257,00:17:27.04,00:17:28.92,"dollars.Right now, it doesn't matter"
258,00:17:28.92,00:17:31.88,"who's Timbira, who's Jalapao.I want to make sure I've got a"
259,00:17:31.88,00:17:40.33,good shot at a million dollars.How do we do this?
260,00:17:40.33,00:17:45.54,"Tonight's the last hard vote.>> Erinn, we can beat for sure"
261,00:17:45.54,00:17:49.00,in the final immunity.Then we're basically guaranteed
262,00:17:49.00,00:18:02.58,"the final two.All right, good."
263,00:18:02.58,00:18:04.21,>> We're taking each other nomatter what.
264,00:18:04.21,00:18:06.88,>> No matter what.J.T. and I are sort of trying to
265,00:18:06.88,00:18:09.42,figure out if we'd rather go tothe final three with Taj or with
266,00:18:09.42,00:18:12.54,"Erinn.If I betray Taj, you know, I"
267,00:18:12.54,00:18:15.54,definitely won't look good inthe jury's eyes.
268,00:18:15.54,00:18:19.04,But how do I get to the finalsand how do I win them?
269,00:18:19.04,00:18:21.00,That's been really guiding allof my decisions.
270,00:18:21.00,00:18:22.71,I think Taj is gettingsuspicious.
271,00:18:22.71,00:18:27.17,">> Yeah.>> If we vote off Erinn tonight,"
272,00:18:27.17,00:18:29.75,"then it will be Taj, me andJ.T. in the next immunity"
273,00:18:29.75,00:18:32.00,challenge.I think Taj has a stronger
274,00:18:32.00,00:18:35.21,"chance than Erinn would in thatchallenge, and I think there's"
275,00:18:35.21,00:18:37.79,also a very good chance that Tajwould take J.T. to the final
276,00:18:37.79,00:18:40.79,"two.Maybe she thinks, ""I'm gonna"
277,00:18:40.79,00:18:43.21,take this kid from rural Alabamarather than the New York City
278,00:18:43.21,00:18:46.33,"boy.""So it's a really difficult"
279,00:18:46.33,00:18:49.38,decision on both strategic andmoral and personal grounds.
280,00:18:49.38,00:18:52.42,">> Yeah, that's who we're goingfor?"
281,00:18:52.42,00:18:54.46,>> Yeah.>> Definitely?
282,00:18:54.46,00:18:56.33,>> Who else?>> I just want to make sure.
283,00:18:56.33,00:18:58.25,You never know.>> Y'all can't go for me.
284,00:18:58.25,00:19:00.17,">> No, I would never...>> Thank God."
285,00:19:00.17,00:19:04.04,">> Oh, so that means you andErinn are going to vote for me."
286,00:19:04.04,00:19:07.04,Um... hello?>> Huh?
287,00:19:07.04,00:19:08.79,">> You're not voting for me?>> No, no, I was making sure"
288,00:19:08.79,00:19:13.08,y'all wasn't voting for me.>> Tonight is a very hard Tribal
289,00:19:13.08,00:19:16.12,"Council.Taj, myself and Stephen-- we"
290,00:19:16.12,00:19:20.33,"are the tightest three in thisgame, no doubt about it, and so"
291,00:19:20.33,00:19:23.50,"we're definitely reassuring Tajthat Erinn's going home, and"
292,00:19:23.50,00:19:26.00,Erinn may be going home.We're not sure what we're going
293,00:19:26.00,00:19:28.04,"to do tonight, but Stephen and Iare going to stick together on"
294,00:19:28.04,00:19:59.25,whatever decision we make.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
295,00:19:59.25,00:20:10.46,"the members of our jury.Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Debbie,"
296,00:20:10.46,00:20:14.17,"and Coach, voted out at the lastTribal Council."
297,00:20:17.46,00:20:21.46,"Stephen, going back to themerge, it was six Timbira"
298,00:20:21.46,00:20:25.12,"members, three Jalapao.Here we are tonight."
299,00:20:25.12,00:20:27.71,Five of the six Timbira are onthe jury.
300,00:20:27.71,00:20:30.42,"How did this happen?>> Um, basically, we sort of had"
301,00:20:30.42,00:20:32.83,"a game plan, you know.We each kind of selected a few"
302,00:20:32.83,00:20:34.88,members of Timbira who wethought we might connect with
303,00:20:34.88,00:20:36.79,and I think that's really helpedus.
304,00:20:36.79,00:20:38.96,I think what was the mostimportant thing was just we
305,00:20:38.96,00:20:43.12,"would always stick together.>> PROBST: Erinn, you are the"
306,00:20:43.12,00:20:46.50,lone remaining Timbira member.All of your former tribemates
307,00:20:46.50,00:20:48.71,make up the jury.>> That's true.
308,00:20:48.71,00:20:51.79,"I mean, I'm, like, pretty proudof myself, not, like, in a"
309,00:20:51.79,00:20:54.88,"vengeful way, but, like, itspeaks greatly of my self-"
310,00:20:54.88,00:20:59.04,"perseverance, and I definitelymade decisions that kept me"
311,00:20:59.04,00:21:03.50,"here, and that is amazing to me.>> PROBST: So, Erinn, when you"
312,00:21:03.50,00:21:06.38,"guys get back from thechallenge, is it scramble time"
313,00:21:06.38,00:21:09.12,"for you?>> Um, one thing that I have"
314,00:21:09.12,00:21:13.50,learned watching everyone go outbefore me is that scrambling
315,00:21:13.50,00:21:16.50,"does not work.>> PROBST: So, if history holds"
316,00:21:16.50,00:21:19.71,"true to form, the final Timbiramember-- you-- will join the"
317,00:21:19.71,00:21:22.42,"jury, and the Jalapao three willbattle it out to see who goes to"
318,00:21:22.42,00:21:24.04,the end.>> Absolutely.
319,00:21:24.04,00:21:27.42,These three really have beenworking together since day one
320,00:21:27.42,00:21:30.42,or two of this game.I wouldn't be surprised if they
321,00:21:30.42,00:21:33.29,"continued to do so.>> PROBST: Taj, how big a risk"
322,00:21:33.29,00:21:37.12,would it be to let Erinn have ashot of going to the end when
323,00:21:37.12,00:21:40.21,all of her former tribemates areon the jury?
324,00:21:40.21,00:21:43.21,">> Well, that might be a plusfor her because we are the three"
325,00:21:43.21,00:21:45.92,Jalapao members that came in andput all of the Timbira members
326,00:21:45.92,00:21:48.00,on the jury.They may not want to vote for
327,00:21:48.00,00:21:50.62,"one of us, so she might get thevotes just to be vindictive."
328,00:21:50.62,00:21:53.29,So it could be pretty dangerous.>> PROBST: It seems like that
329,00:21:53.29,00:21:56.12,"the safest bet, Stephen, is tohave the Jalapao three go to the"
330,00:21:56.12,00:22:01.33,"end because then, at least we'reall even."
331,00:22:01.33,00:22:02.75,">> I mean, there's definitelythat to consider."
332,00:22:02.75,00:22:05.75,"I also think it's an individualgame, and you have to consider"
333,00:22:05.75,00:22:08.79,"everyone in the eyes of thejury, you know, and so you also"
334,00:22:08.79,00:22:10.58,"have to think, like, ""Who do Imeasure up against best?"""
335,00:22:10.58,00:22:12.54,">> PROBST: Does that mean, then,that, now that Coach is out,"
336,00:22:12.54,00:22:15.21,"this whole philosophy of ""takethe best to the end"" is gone?"
337,00:22:15.21,00:22:18.04,">> I mean, look, I respectedCoach's philosophy and I always"
338,00:22:18.04,00:22:20.71,"wanted to be there with thebest, but obviously, I have"
339,00:22:20.71,00:22:23.12,formed real bonds with everybodyhere.
340,00:22:23.12,00:22:25.58,"And so, you know, I almost hopeI'm not in the position to make"
341,00:22:25.58,00:22:27.75,"that... that decision.>> PROBST: Well, but you are."
342,00:22:27.75,00:22:29.71,"You have a vote.I almost feel as though, as the"
343,00:22:29.71,00:22:33.83,"thunder continues to cracklearound us, it's almost like you"
344,00:22:33.83,00:22:36.08,"just showed up and this is yourfirst day here, and you... you"
345,00:22:36.08,00:22:37.71,don't even know how the game isplayed.
346,00:22:37.71,00:22:41.50,"You can only vote for Erinn orTaj, so which is it?"
347,00:22:41.50,00:22:43.42,>> Okay.(sighs)
348,00:22:43.42,00:22:46.71,"I guess, for me, you know, thevote tonight is about: how do I"
349,00:22:46.71,00:22:50.04,better assure myself a place inthe finals?
350,00:22:50.04,00:22:52.71,">> PROBST: J.T., you've come along way together."
351,00:22:52.71,00:22:55.46,"Trust these other three?>> Yeah, I obviously trust"
352,00:22:55.46,00:22:58.50,"Stephen and Taj more so thanErinn, because I've spent a lot"
353,00:22:58.50,00:23:01.21,more time with them.And they've made promises that
354,00:23:01.21,00:23:04.42,"have been kept.I've come to trust Erinn, but"
355,00:23:04.42,00:23:06.83,not near as much as I trust theother two.
356,00:23:06.83,00:23:09.21,>> PROBST: Taj.>> I agree.
357,00:23:09.21,00:23:11.62,"From day one, J.T. and Stephenhave been by my side, so I have"
358,00:23:11.62,00:23:14.38,"no reason to distrust them.And Erinn, I-I think she's a"
359,00:23:14.38,00:23:17.17,"great girl and I-I believe inher, but I haven't been around"
360,00:23:17.17,00:23:19.33,her long enough to put mycomplete faith in her.
361,00:23:19.33,00:23:22.08,>> PROBST: Would you be a littleshocked if it was you tonight?
362,00:23:22.08,00:23:24.21,">> Oh, it... yeah, I would bevery shocked if it was me"
363,00:23:24.21,00:23:25.83,tonight.I would be very shocked.
364,00:23:25.83,00:23:28.29,"But everyone has a plan, and-andeveryone's trying to win a"
365,00:23:28.29,00:23:30.75,"million dollars, so there's...there's no rules."
366,00:23:30.75,00:23:33.96,">> PROBST: Erinn, let's flip it.If, at the end of tonight's"
367,00:23:33.96,00:23:37.54,"vote, you, the only remainingTimbira member, are still here,"
368,00:23:37.54,00:23:41.21,you going to be shocked?>> Surprised.
369,00:23:41.21,00:23:43.83,"I wouldn't say ""shocked,""because anything can happen, but"

558,00:36:27.38,00:36:30.46,might have also had something todo with the game and the fact
559,00:36:30.46,00:36:34.46,that I got voted out fifth.I tended to trust more people
560,00:36:34.46,00:36:36.33,than my older tribe mates wouldhave done.
561,00:36:36.33,00:36:39.67,"I wanted to see the good inpeople, and in a game like this,"
562,00:36:39.67,00:36:41.92,you really... you have to checkthat at the door.

573,00:37:16.00,00:37:18.33,"other people.Like, if I feel something, then"
574,00:37:18.33,00:37:21.79,"why don't I just do it?I need to be more, I guess,"
575,00:37:21.79,00:37:27.25,"self-assured, and that'ssomething I learned for sure."
576,00:37:29.96,00:37:32.79,">> Joe.>> Oh, Joe."

581,00:37:44.58,00:37:47.25,"The main lesson I learned isthat just generally speaking,"
582,00:37:47.25,00:37:49.25,"like, Mother Nature is a prettyawesome force."
583,00:37:49.25,00:37:52.46,"I think I'm tough enough to winthis game, but I injured my"

613,00:39:26.71,00:39:30.67,the whole entire game for me.I wore my heart on my sleeve.
614,00:39:30.67,00:39:35.04,I stayed true to who I was.I did everything I could but
615,00:39:35.04,00:39:37.42,"give up, and I was really happyabout that."

627,00:40:13.04,00:40:16.08,I deal with all different kindsof people every single day.
628,00:40:16.08,00:40:19.12,So I really thought this gamewas going to be something that I
629,00:40:19.12,00:40:21.08,"would get in here, figureeverybody out."
630,00:40:21.08,00:40:25.29,"Um, unfortunately, I've alsolearned that I maybe am not as"

632,00:40:27.54,00:40:30.08,But there's not many things thatcan be thrown at me in life
633,00:40:30.08,00:40:35.67,anymore that I won't know thatI can't handle.
634,00:40:36.71,00:40:39.29,>> Coach.>> My most satisfying blindside
635,00:40:39.29,00:40:42.04,to date.>> Probably one of the most

647,00:41:11.04,00:41:15.12,think of no finer way to go outthan a man who has fought in
648,00:41:15.12,00:41:17.42,battle.I go back to the Vikings and
649,00:41:17.42,00:41:20.04,"the Indians and the samurai.You look at how they died, and"
650,00:41:20.04,00:41:23.54,"how did I leave?Head held high in the end, not"
651,00:41:23.54,00:41:27.12,"defeated, not broken.And hopefully, like a Greek"

654,00:41:37.75,00:41:40.08,hardest vote so far this game.She's an incredibly strong

807,00:52:55.62,00:52:58.21,They have come a long waytogether in this game.

813,00:53:11.67,00:53:14.04,that he's somebody that reallywants and really needs this
814,00:53:14.04,00:53:16.88,money.And if J.T. wants to win a

929,00:59:51.71,00:59:53.62,>> (laughing): Damn.>> Sure.

933,00:59:59.12,01:00:00.83,J.T.>> I'm pretty damn nervous
934,01:00:00.83,01:00:02.62,myself.>> (laughing): I think he's more

938,01:00:13.88,01:00:17.04,">> You know, I'm not 100%, but Ifeel like I'd have a much better"
939,01:00:17.04,01:00:20.04,opportunity beating Erinn injury votes because I do know
940,01:00:20.04,01:00:23.08,"that her tribemates were tryingto get rid of her on, like, day"
941,01:00:23.08,01:00:25.50,nine.That alone tells me that they
942,01:00:25.50,01:00:28.04,would not really want to giveher a million dollars compared
943,01:00:28.04,01:00:31.83,"to me, so, you know, there's,there's a huge, huge reason why"
944,01:00:31.83,01:00:34.42,I should take Erinn to the finaltwo.

948,01:00:42.46,01:00:45.29,"Therefore, you will not vote.Which means, J.T., you're the"
949,01:00:45.29,01:00:48.17,"only one voting.If you choose right, this time"
950,01:00:48.17,01:00:50.17,"tomorrow night, you're amillionaire."

952,01:01:22.71,01:01:38.79,"I'll go get the vote.Once the votes are read, the"
953,01:01:38.79,01:01:41.00,decision is final.The person voted out will be
954,01:01:41.00,01:01:42.83,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.

968,01:03:03.17,01:03:06.88,"but I think, like, deep down, Idefinitely knew that that was"
969,01:03:06.88,01:03:10.21,"the decision that J.T. was goingto make, and I'm really proud of"
970,01:03:10.21,01:03:13.54,"myself for as far as I've come.It's really been life-changing,"
971,01:03:13.54,01:03:18.38,and I'm glad I was able tostick around as long as I did.
972,01:03:46.75,01:03:49.29,>> I feel really great.It's day 39.
973,01:03:49.29,01:03:52.83,"Uh, the sun's coming up.It's a beautiful morning, and,"
974,01:03:52.83,01:03:56.29,"uh, I'm still here.Stephen's here with me, just"
975,01:03:56.29,01:04:00.08,like we planned a long time ago.And it's kind of hard to

977,01:04:05.00,01:04:08.54,"friends for life.>> I know, man."
978,01:04:08.54,01:04:12.00,>> It's hugely satisfying to behere with J.T. at the end.
979,01:04:12.00,01:04:14.67,"Since the beginning of the game,we've been talking about final"
980,01:04:14.67,01:04:19.04,"two, and here we are, finalfreaking two, day 39, and"

999,01:05:27.33,01:05:30.54,about day 39 together as thissymbol of our achievement
1000,01:05:30.54,01:05:32.71,together.This was our reward for
1001,01:05:32.71,01:05:36.08,"overcoming all of the obstaclesin our way, and we got to share"
1002,01:05:36.08,01:05:39.62,"it-- just us, successful.>> Won't shake it up, 'cause I"

1065,01:09:23.04,01:09:25.62,could have made this decision onday one and spared everyone a

1069,01:09:34.58,01:09:37.25,"everything, decide everythingtogether, and I think that's why"
1070,01:09:37.25,01:09:40.08,"we did so well, because we wereable to work together, but I"
1071,01:09:40.08,01:09:43.00,kind of want to focus maybe onnot what we brought into the
1072,01:09:43.00,01:09:45.29,game but what we've taken out ofthe game.

1085,01:10:22.96,01:10:25.04,here.I'm actually the first person in

1087,01:10:28.08,01:10:30.71,a pity vote.Because I worked very hard to
1088,01:10:30.71,01:10:33.08,get where I'm at.I did everything I possibly
1089,01:10:33.08,01:10:35.71,could to provide for everybodyat every chance I got.
1090,01:10:35.71,01:10:38.38,And most of the times that guythat puts things like that on
1091,01:10:38.38,01:10:40.71,"the line-- they're voted outright off the bat, you know."
1092,01:10:40.71,01:10:44.25,"And to do that and accept it andnever get a vote in this game,"
1093,01:10:44.25,01:10:47.04,"not once, you know, is a hugeaccomplishment for me."
1094,01:10:47.04,01:10:49.08,And to make friends with youguys.
1095,01:10:49.08,01:10:51.67,"I mean, it was very hard tovote you guys out."
1096,01:10:51.67,01:10:54.25,The way we picked who we votedoff was the people that we
1097,01:10:54.25,01:10:56.54,thought were going to vote usoff.
1098,01:10:56.54,01:10:59.21,And had we not gotten rid of youyou'd be sitting where I'm at
1099,01:10:59.21,01:11:01.50,today and I'd be over there.There's no doubt about it.
1100,01:11:01.50,01:11:04.08,"But I do stick to my word, youknow."
1101,01:11:04.08,01:11:06.79,I had a really easy opportunityto bring Erinn who I felt like--
1102,01:11:06.79,01:11:09.71,"Erinn, you know, no offense--was I felt like I could beat up"
1103,01:11:09.71,01:11:12.71,"here a lot easier, you know.Everyone loves Stephen."
1104,01:11:12.71,01:11:15.50,"I do, too.So I feel like he deserved to be"
1105,01:11:15.50,01:11:18.04,"here beside me.Do I feel like he's outwitted,"

1107,01:11:21.08,01:11:23.83,But that's in your guys' handsnow.
1108,01:11:23.83,01:11:26.25,"That's about all.>> PROBST: Thanks, Stephen."
1109,01:11:26.25,01:11:28.50,"Thanks, J.T.All right, jury, in a moment"
1110,01:11:28.50,01:11:31.21,you're going to get your firstchance to address Stephen and
1111,01:11:31.21,01:11:33.50,J.T.Give you a minute to think about
1112,01:11:33.50,01:11:47.25,"what you want to say. >> PROBST: All right, jury,"
1113,01:11:47.25,01:11:50.75,"it's now your first chance toaddress Stephen and J.T., hoping"
1114,01:11:50.75,01:11:54.08,to gather a little informationto help you make a very big
1115,01:11:54.08,01:11:57.67,"decision-- who deserves to winthis game, who deserves the"
1116,01:11:57.67,01:12:01.17,"million dollars.Brendan, let's get started."
1117,01:12:01.17,01:12:03.75,You're up first.>> Congratulations to you guys
1118,01:12:03.75,01:12:05.75,both.It's been fun watching you both
1119,01:12:05.75,01:12:07.29,play the game.My first question is for
1120,01:12:07.29,01:12:09.04,Stephen.You spent so much of your first
1121,01:12:09.04,01:12:12.17,argument talking about yourgrowth within the game.
1122,01:12:12.17,01:12:15.00,"For me I look at, you know, allthe different sporting events"
1123,01:12:15.00,01:12:18.21,"and all the different games thatwe've all seen, and in not one"
1124,01:12:18.21,01:12:22.67,game is who works hardest or whogrows the most the reason that
1125,01:12:22.67,01:12:25.42,you win the game.Can you think of anything?
1126,01:12:25.42,01:12:28.04,">> I mean, the game of Survivoractually might be one of them."
1127,01:12:28.04,01:12:30.04,"I mean, there's that outwit,out-outplay, outlast."
1128,01:12:30.04,01:12:32.08,So there is that outwitcomponent.
1129,01:12:32.08,01:12:34.38,I obviously had to focus more onthat than outplay.
1130,01:12:34.38,01:12:37.00,">> So should you be handicapped?>> No, no, but I'm saying for me"
1131,01:12:37.00,01:12:39.29,to last this long has been areal struggle.
1132,01:12:39.29,01:12:41.67,"You know, J.T.'s an amazingoutdoorsman."
1133,01:12:41.67,01:12:44.79,"I came in with none of theseskills, I still persevered and"
1134,01:12:44.79,01:12:47.08,will be leaving the game withmany of them.
1135,01:12:47.08,01:12:49.46,">> J.T., you know, when youthink about this idea of growth,"
1136,01:12:49.46,01:12:52.21,in terms of deciding who shouldactually come home with
1137,01:12:52.21,01:12:54.83,"a million dollars, do you thinkit's relevant?"
1138,01:12:54.83,01:12:58.04,">> Growth is irrelevant, really.I mean, that's something you can"
1139,01:12:58.04,01:13:00.12,carry home with you.That's something that's good for
1140,01:13:00.12,01:13:03.21,"you personally, but, obviously,you know, if you go to a"
1141,01:13:03.21,01:13:05.50,football game and just becauseit was harder for you to catch
1142,01:13:05.50,01:13:08.12,"the ball and you catch it,doesn't make it better than the"
1143,01:13:08.12,01:13:10.17,person that already knew how tocatch it.
1144,01:13:10.17,01:13:12.46,"So, I do feel like I outplayedStephen and, you know, Stephen"
1145,01:13:12.46,01:13:15.00,hid in the shadows in some ofthe challenges.
1146,01:13:15.00,01:13:17.00,"I had to tell him, ""Dude, youcan do it."""
1147,01:13:17.00,01:13:19.08,"Have confidence in yourself.>> I mean, can I-- can I have a"
1148,01:13:19.08,01:13:21.88,"rebuttal to what he just said?>> Sure, I love it. Let's go."
1149,01:13:21.88,01:13:24.25,">> Okay, um, hiding in theshadows is a legitimate"
1150,01:13:24.25,01:13:26.58,strategy.I think we all know that.
1151,01:13:26.58,01:13:29.04,>> I would think a guy that putshis neck out on the line would--
1152,01:13:29.04,01:13:31.08,should earn a little morerespect than someone that kind
1153,01:13:31.08,01:13:34.12,of floats under the radar.>> Okay.
1154,01:13:34.12,01:13:36.108,Cool.Thank you.
1155,01:13:38.67,01:13:42.67,>> PROBST: Erinn.You're up.
1156,01:13:42.67,01:13:47.04,">> Stephen, I have seen you playthree very specific alliances--"
1157,01:13:47.04,01:13:54.04,"the Jalapao three, the Exilealliance, the Warrior alliance."
1158,01:13:54.04,01:13:59.71,But almost everyone in everyone of those alliances is on
1159,01:13:59.71,01:14:02.96,the jury.So should I just vote for J.T.?
1160,01:14:02.96,01:14:06.75,">> Look, you know, obviouslythis game involves a lot of, you"
1161,01:14:06.75,01:14:10.04,"know, creating a lot of dynamicstructures and then working"
1162,01:14:10.04,01:14:12.12,within those structures toadvance yourself as best as you
1163,01:14:12.12,01:14:14.25,can.In terms of moving within those
1164,01:14:14.25,01:14:16.50,"alliances, zigging when you haveto zig, zagging when you have to"
1165,01:14:16.50,01:14:19.67,zag to get yourself further...I think I did that really well.
1166,01:14:19.67,01:14:22.21,"If you respect that aggressivestyle of play, I hope you vote"
1167,01:14:22.21,01:14:24.29,"for me.And I-- if you don't, I"
1168,01:14:24.29,01:14:27.25,understand if you don't.>> Okay.
1169,01:14:27.25,01:14:32.42,"J.T., there's been a lot of talkabout taking the strength to the"
1170,01:14:32.42,01:14:35.29,end.Can you be really honest and
1171,01:14:35.29,01:14:41.17,tell me why Stephen is the best?>> I felt like Stephen was the
1172,01:14:41.17,01:14:46.12,best because at the time he wasthe most honest person with me.
1173,01:14:46.12,01:14:49.17,"No matter what we done, he wasalways there, and I feel like in"
1174,01:14:49.17,01:14:52.08,"Jalapao he was definitely thebest, and when we moved over,"
1175,01:14:52.08,01:14:54.12,"Coach said, ""Who is the nextstrongest person?"""
1176,01:14:54.12,01:14:56.67,"I said out of everybody inJalapao, Stephen is the best."
1177,01:14:56.67,01:14:59.21,"You know, I could have left himout there, but I brought him"
1178,01:14:59.21,01:15:02.12,along in the power alliance.And out of the power alliance
1179,01:15:02.12,01:15:05.46,"that I thought was the best, itwould be me and Stephen, no"
1180,01:15:05.46,01:15:09.67,doubt about it.>> PROBST: Thanks.
1181,01:15:09.67,01:15:14.17,"Deb, you're up.>> Hi, guys."
1182,01:15:14.17,01:15:17.50,I want to start by telling youthat I haven't decided...
1183,01:15:17.50,01:15:21.08,as to who is going to have myvote for a million dollars.
1184,01:15:21.08,01:15:26.46,"J.T., one of the things that ismost important to me is honesty."
1185,01:15:26.46,01:15:30.71,"I immediately was drawn to you.I was like this is a great guy,"
1186,01:15:30.71,01:15:34.50,"great, pure heart.As the game progressed, all of a"
1187,01:15:34.50,01:15:36.54,"sudden, I thought, man, Imisjudged this guy."
1188,01:15:36.54,01:15:42.29,So was my first instinct right?Or is lying and deception your
1189,01:15:42.29,01:15:45.58,"MO, and you just let me thinkthat you're somebody else in the"
1190,01:15:45.58,01:15:47.79,"beginning?>> Debbie, I'll be honest with"
1191,01:15:47.79,01:15:51.79,you-- when I come into this gamemy mother told me do not believe
1192,01:15:51.79,01:15:54.71,what everybody tells you.You're going to have to lie to
1193,01:15:54.71,01:15:57.75,win this game.A million dollars on the line.
1194,01:15:57.75,01:16:00.96,"I mean, you'd have done the samething I did at the end of the"
1195,01:16:00.96,01:16:02.67,"game.You know, you didn't go tell"
1196,01:16:02.67,01:16:04.92,"Coach, that, ""Hey, I'm fixing tovote you out,"" you know."
1197,01:16:04.92,01:16:07.75,I had to do that in order to gethere.
1198,01:16:07.75,01:16:10.33,">> Okay, I appreciate that.I appreciate that."
1199,01:16:10.33,01:16:15.54,"Stephen, my question is, ifyesterday you had the immunity"
1200,01:16:15.54,01:16:19.33,"necklace on that J.T. had, wouldJ.T. be the one sitting next to"
1201,01:16:19.33,01:16:22.17,you right now?I want an honest answer to this

1203,01:16:25.21,01:16:28.12,"honestly, and I want to speakhonestly in answer to every"
1204,01:16:28.12,01:16:30.08,question tonight.I-- I don't know.
1205,01:16:30.08,01:16:32.08,And I never made thatdecision...
1206,01:16:32.08,01:16:34.50,">> No, that-that's not good.No, stop."
1207,01:16:34.50,01:16:36.50,"I like you, Stephen.>> Okay."
1208,01:16:36.50,01:16:39.08,">> I do, but-but I don't want ""Idon't know."""
1209,01:16:39.08,01:16:42.29,"I've got to decide if I'm votingfor you, for a million dollars."
1210,01:16:42.29,01:16:45.12,"You do know who would be sittingnext to you, and I, quite"
1211,01:16:45.12,01:16:49.29,"frankly, feel like I might, too.I need a clear answer from you,"
1212,01:16:49.29,01:16:51.92,Stephen.And I need you to be honest.
1213,01:16:51.92,01:16:56.12,That's what I'm basing my voteon is honesty.
1214,01:16:56.12,01:17:01.42,>> I think it would be Erinn.I-I hope I would have taken
1215,01:17:01.42,01:17:03.67,J.T.My fear is that I would've
1216,01:17:03.67,01:17:06.25,chosen Erinn if it had come downto it.
1217,01:17:06.25,01:17:09.25,">> Thank you.Okay, I appreciate that."
1218,01:17:09.25,01:17:12.42,Good luck to both of you.I'll listen the rest of the
1219,01:17:12.42,01:17:15.46,"evening, and my vote's stillout there."
1220,01:17:15.46,01:17:19.25,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Thanks. Thanks, Deb."

1222,01:17:23.88,01:17:27.17,power alliance.Makes me a little bit proud to
1223,01:17:27.17,01:17:30.08,see the warrior and the wizardup here.
1224,01:17:30.08,01:17:32.21,"A lot of unanswered questions.You know, I had a lot of"
1225,01:17:32.21,01:17:34.12,philosophies coming into thisgame.
1226,01:17:34.12,01:17:36.71,"One of them was ""as ironsharpens iron, so one man"
1227,01:17:36.71,01:17:39.50,"sharpens another.""So, keep that in mind"
1228,01:17:39.50,01:17:43.25,"and we'll start with you, J.T.Honesty and integrity."
1229,01:17:43.25,01:17:45.71,"Early on, it's easy to keepthat."
1230,01:17:45.71,01:17:48.04,"Late in the game, when itcounts is what I want to hear"
1231,01:17:48.04,01:17:51.25,examples and then the secondpart of that is being the noble
1232,01:17:51.25,01:17:54.29,"warrior, putting others in frontof yourself while being"
1233,01:17:54.29,01:17:57.83,"ferocious on the battlefield.So, give me examples of honesty"
1234,01:17:57.83,01:18:01.29,late in the game when it countsand also being that noble
1235,01:18:01.29,01:18:04.04,"warrior.>> Coach, there was times"
1236,01:18:04.04,01:18:05.83,towards the end of the gamewhere I couldn't tell you
1237,01:18:05.83,01:18:08.62,"everything that was going on,but when I made a promise to"
1238,01:18:08.62,01:18:11.88,"you, like the one I made afterthe last challenge we had, I"
1239,01:18:11.88,01:18:13.25,"said, ""I promise you, I'm votingfor Erinn."""
1240,01:18:13.25,01:18:16.08,"I knew you were going homethat night, but there was no way"
1241,01:18:16.08,01:18:19.17,"I was gonna vote for you, Coach,because you and I and Stephen "
1242,01:18:19.17,01:18:21.50,could've been sitting here.I'd have felt comfortable taking
1243,01:18:21.50,01:18:24.04,you because I knew you'd havetaken me to the final two.
1244,01:18:24.04,01:18:28.08,"Uh, you know, I thought Stephenwould, um, but, you know, I just"
1245,01:18:28.08,01:18:30.50,found out otherwise. I said I would take the
1246,01:18:30.50,01:18:33.58,strongest that was left to theend and I could have took the
1247,01:18:33.58,01:18:37.71,easy million dollars with Erinn.I risked a million dollars in
1248,01:18:37.71,01:18:40.58,"order to keep my word to you andkeep my word to Stephen,"
1249,01:18:40.58,01:18:42.42,bringing the strongest thatwas left to the end.
1250,01:18:42.42,01:18:46.25,"I may be that dumb fool thatmixes morals with millions, you"
1251,01:18:46.25,01:18:48.96,"know?And as far as being a warrior,"
1252,01:18:48.96,01:18:52.17,"I battled everything I done100%, no matter what, and I"
1253,01:18:52.17,01:18:55.67,"never give up on anything I do.>> Okay, I'm going to move to"
1254,01:18:55.67,01:18:57.71,Stephen.Same question-- honor and
1255,01:18:57.71,01:19:01.50,"integrity, and being a warrior.>> All right, I think that, I"
1256,01:19:01.50,01:19:04.25,"mean, in terms of honor andintegrity, this may sound"
1257,01:19:04.25,01:19:08.21,"perverse, but I voted for everysingle one of you."
1258,01:19:08.21,01:19:11.04,I never took the weasel way out.And J.T. knew you were getting
1259,01:19:11.04,01:19:12.88,"a limit...Well, I don't want to..."
1260,01:19:12.88,01:19:15.17,"I mean, I'm not gonna make thatcomparison. I'm sorry."
1261,01:19:15.17,01:19:17.25,>> I told 'em that.>> I want to say that I did vote
1262,01:19:17.25,01:19:19.83,"for every one of you, because Ifelt like if I was going to try"
1263,01:19:19.83,01:19:22.25,"to take you out, I was going tobear the moral burden of that."
1264,01:19:22.25,01:19:24.67,"Um, so whenever there was avote, I absolutely wanted to"
1265,01:19:24.67,01:19:28.00,write the person's name down.In terms of being a noble
1266,01:19:28.00,01:19:30.42,"warrior, I have yet to sayanything negative about J.T."
1267,01:19:30.42,01:19:32.54,"tonight, and I think that...I think that's a strong"
1268,01:19:32.54,01:19:36.67,statement.>> Okay.

1271,01:19:44.62,01:19:47.58,you.I had a question for Stephen
1272,01:19:47.58,01:19:50.33,"tonight, and he pretty muchalready addressed all of it, so"
1273,01:19:50.33,01:19:52.38,I don't have any furtherquestions for you.
1274,01:19:52.38,01:19:54.42,I've heard enough.I still think you're a

1276,01:19:57.04,01:20:01.75,"you is, what does taking thestrongest really mean to you?"
1277,01:20:01.75,01:20:05.04,Because you're standing with oneof the weakest players I've ever
1278,01:20:05.04,01:20:07.50,seen.And when you had the choice to
1279,01:20:07.50,01:20:12.46,"take Taj with you, you tookanother weak player, Erinn."
1280,01:20:12.46,01:20:15.21,"So actually, you took the twoweakest players with you."
1281,01:20:15.21,01:20:18.17,How do you admire that and wantto sit next to that?
1282,01:20:18.17,01:20:21.25,">> Actually, I really feel likeStephen is a strong competitor."
1283,01:20:21.25,01:20:23.67,He won the individual immunitynecklace and almost beat me in
1284,01:20:23.67,01:20:27.12,the final immunity challenge.And of the stronger players that
1285,01:20:27.12,01:20:30.58,"was left in the final four, Ibelieve that Stephen was the"
1286,01:20:30.58,01:20:33.21,strongest left.>> You choosing Stephen was the
1287,01:20:33.21,01:20:37.67,"right thing, but you lost a lotof my respect, because you could"
1288,01:20:37.67,01:20:40.04,have been sitting here tonightwith Tyson.
1289,01:20:40.04,01:20:43.21,You could have been sitting heretonight with Brendan or Debbie.
1290,01:20:43.21,01:20:46.29,"And that vote, if you would havewon, you would have been a"
1291,01:20:46.29,01:20:48.54,"stronger man, because you weresitting next to a strong"
1292,01:20:48.54,01:20:50.58,competitor.That just may be your downfall
1293,01:20:50.58,01:20:53.79,and the reason why you might notget a million dollars tonight.
1294,01:20:53.79,01:21:00.62,">> PROBST: Thanks, Sierra.Tyson."
1295,01:21:00.62,01:21:02.62,">> Dudes.Good job, guys."
1296,01:21:02.62,01:21:06.17,"Um, you both have talked aboutsharing a brain on all the"
1297,01:21:06.17,01:21:09.29,"strategy.Actually, Stephen said J.T. was"
1298,01:21:09.29,01:21:12.12,an asset to him getting to thefinal.
1299,01:21:12.12,01:21:15.12,"J.T., was Stephen an asset foryou in getting to the final, as"
1300,01:21:15.12,01:21:18.38,"well, and why?>> I think Stephen did help me"
1301,01:21:18.38,01:21:21.17,as far as keeping each other incheck.
1302,01:21:21.17,01:21:25.17,But could I do it without him?I feel like I could have made
1303,01:21:25.17,01:21:28.12,"this adventure without him, butI don't think it would have been"
1304,01:21:28.12,01:21:30.17,"near as easy.>> Stephen, you want to reply"
1305,01:21:30.17,01:21:33.88,to that?>> I think J.T. and my
1306,01:21:33.88,01:21:36.08,partnership was unique.I'm sorry that he devalues it
1307,01:21:36.08,01:21:38.58,like that.It hurts me a lot.
1308,01:21:38.58,01:21:41.46,"I mean, to say that, ""Oh, yeah,it could be you, it could be"
1309,01:21:41.46,01:21:43.88,"someone else,"" when we worked sowell together."
1310,01:21:43.88,01:21:45.71,"You know, that obviously, Idon't think that's true."
1311,01:21:45.71,01:21:47.83,I don't think that's true foreither of us.
1312,01:21:47.83,01:21:50.17,"I don't think it's true for him,and I don't think it's true for"
1313,01:21:50.17,01:21:52.50,me.>> Do you think you would have
1314,01:21:52.50,01:21:54.83,been sitting here had someoneelse won immunity last night?
1315,01:21:54.83,01:21:56.62,">> That's a complicatedquestion, right?"
1316,01:21:56.62,01:21:58.29,"Like, who's gonna be...?Who is it?"
1317,01:21:58.29,01:22:00.75,I think Erinn would have takenme.
1318,01:22:00.75,01:22:03.04,I think Taj would have taken me.>> Okay.
1319,01:22:03.04,01:22:05.04,">> So, yeah.>> Are we done on that?"
1320,01:22:05.04,01:22:07.04,>> Yeah.>> Okay.
1321,01:22:07.04,01:22:09.04,"Thanks, boys.>> PROBST: Thanks, Tyson."
1322,01:22:09.04,01:22:14.12,Taj.Finish us off.
1323,01:22:17.50,01:22:20.92,">> Crushed, betrayed, extremelydisappointed."
1324,01:22:20.92,01:22:23.25,It's not so much that I'm onthe jury right now.
1325,01:22:23.25,01:22:25.83,It's just the way I went to thejury.
1326,01:22:25.83,01:22:28.12,I just felt it was sounnecessary.
1327,01:22:28.12,01:22:30.38,But that's the nature of thegame.
1328,01:22:30.38,01:22:32.88,"So my first question, I guess,would be to J.T."
1329,01:22:32.88,01:22:36.12,You found it so hard to putCoach's name down on the paper.
1330,01:22:36.12,01:22:38.88,You don't want to lie to him.But it seemed like it was
1331,01:22:38.88,01:22:41.17,effortless to put my name downon the paper.
1332,01:22:41.17,01:22:44.33,Did you not think that it wouldbe hard to lie to me?
1333,01:22:44.33,01:22:46.29,">> Taj, there was nothingeffortless about putting your"
1334,01:22:46.29,01:22:48.75,name down.The hardest vote I made in this
1335,01:22:48.75,01:22:52.17,"game was voting you out.Taj, I've stuck my neck out for"
1336,01:22:52.17,01:22:54.71,"you this whole game, as well asyou for me."
1337,01:22:54.71,01:22:56.96,We've been like brother andsister.
1338,01:22:56.96,01:23:01.67,"I mean, it was almost harderthan my vote last night."
1339,01:23:01.67,01:23:05.50,">> And Stephen, I saw things inyou that I just... I didn't even"
1340,01:23:05.50,01:23:08.62,recognize on the last two orthree days.
1341,01:23:08.62,01:23:12.71,"Especially you, because you,from, like, day one, was in my"
1342,01:23:12.71,01:23:15.17,back pocket.We-We were tight.
1343,01:23:15.17,01:23:17.71,At least I thought.Was it so important to blindside
1344,01:23:17.71,01:23:20.46,"me to get me out, because was Ithat much of a threat?"
1345,01:23:20.46,01:23:24.17,">> All right, I guess, I mean,the truth is J.T. had been"
1346,01:23:24.17,01:23:26.04,talking about taking you outnext for a while.
1347,01:23:26.04,01:23:29.58,I had wanted to keep you arounduntil three.
1348,01:23:29.58,01:23:32.62,And part of that was because itwould be a great statement for
1349,01:23:32.62,01:23:36.92,"the Jalapao three, to end up,you know, facing this entire"
1350,01:23:36.92,01:23:40.12,Timbira jury.But J.T. was concerned that
1351,01:23:40.12,01:23:42.79,you were a tougher physicalcompetitor to beat.
1352,01:23:42.79,01:23:45.92,"I got nervous that you wouldn'ttake me, and sort of gave in on"
1353,01:23:45.92,01:23:48.42,the point.So that's why I ended up
1354,01:23:48.42,01:23:51.42,"agreeing to vote you out.>> Taj, I'd like to add, he just"
1355,01:23:51.42,01:23:54.29,made it sound like it was justmy idea to take you out.
1356,01:23:54.29,01:23:57.42,That's not true.That's not true at all.
1357,01:23:57.42,01:24:00.08,And I'll tell him that any dayof the week.
1358,01:24:00.08,01:24:02.83,"He made... He just made himselfsound like, you know, he was the"
1359,01:24:02.83,01:24:05.08,one protecting you.That's-That's not how it went
1360,01:24:05.08,01:24:07.12,"down.>> Well, I mean, to be fair,"
1361,01:24:07.12,01:24:09.17,"then, if...Let's air our laundry."
1362,01:24:09.17,01:24:13.17,"There have been other times whenJ.T. wanted to take you out, and"
1363,01:24:13.17,01:24:15.79,I talked him out of it.The first was in Jalapao.
1364,01:24:15.79,01:24:19.50,"Because you had given uspossession of the idol, J.T."
1365,01:24:19.50,01:24:21.62,thought we could eliminate youand safely have the idol.
1366,01:24:21.62,01:24:23.46,">> You told me, ""I've got theidol."
1367,01:24:23.46,01:24:25.92,"She won't have the idol if wevote her out now."""
1368,01:24:25.92,01:24:27.62,">> No, no, no. You said...>> No, no."
1369,01:24:27.62,01:24:29.25,">> No, no, no, that's not whathappened."
1370,01:24:29.25,01:24:31.21,That is not what happened.I said...
1371,01:24:31.21,01:24:33.25,>> You know what?It's neither here nor there.
1372,01:24:33.25,01:24:35.25,That's fine.>> There were times when I saved
1373,01:24:35.25,01:24:37.71,"you, and J.T. wanted to take youout."
1374,01:24:37.71,01:24:39.79,>> That's fine. Thank you.>> Is this the same guy I
1375,01:24:39.79,01:24:41.46,brought with me?>> Yes.
1376,01:24:41.46,01:24:43.25,">> What are you...?Oh, come on now."
1377,01:24:43.25,01:24:45.21,"You have been slandering me allnight, and I have... I..."
1378,01:24:45.21,01:24:47.67,This is the first time I evertook a shot at you.
1379,01:24:47.67,01:24:49.67,>> But mine have been allaccurate.
1380,01:24:49.67,01:24:51.79,">> And mine have been true...That is true, as well."
1381,01:24:51.79,01:24:55.17,"This... Come on, now.Our friendship means more to me"
1382,01:24:55.17,01:24:59.08,than winning does.>> But you'd have brought Erinn.
1383,01:24:59.08,01:25:01.38,>> I never made that decisionin my heart.
1384,01:25:01.38,01:25:04.67,"I mean, you can believe me, oryou can..."
1385,01:25:04.67,01:25:09.08,"You know, that's fine.>> I just feel like a fool, man."
1386,01:25:09.08,01:25:12.21,">> Oh, come on, now. I mean...Oh, look, whatever."
1387,01:25:12.21,01:25:15.17,"All right.>> PROBST: Jury, some great"
