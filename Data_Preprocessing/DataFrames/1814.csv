90,00:04:53.50,00:04:53.50,easy to vote against him. >> It got you a lot of jury
91,00:04:55.96,00:04:55.96,"votes. >> No way, man, after they saw"

99,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,whereas I'm the guy who backstabbed coach.
100,00:05:17.00,00:05:17.00,"You know, ultimately, I think it'll hurt me."
101,00:05:19.08,00:05:19.08,"You definitely got his vote tonight, friend."
102,00:05:21.12,00:05:21.12,"You know, I-I think I probably will come off as a villain and"

104,00:05:28.46,00:05:28.46,">> I'm, obviously, very loyal to J.T., but I'm also loyal to"
105,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,"myself and my own odds of winning a million dollars, so"
106,00:05:33.33,00:05:33.33,I need to think about who do I want to be there at the end

191,00:12:26.12,00:12:26.12,Stephen. Erinn and Taj both working on
192,00:12:28.62,00:12:28.62,that final bag. Puzzle takes a long time.
193,00:12:33.08,00:12:33.08,"Don't give up, Taj, don't give up, Erinn."
194,00:12:36.67,00:12:36.67,This is big-time immunity. You do not want to go to Tribal
195,00:12:43.58,00:12:43.58,Council tonight without immunity.
196,00:12:47.25,00:12:47.25,Taj through with her third bag. Erinn through with her third
197,00:12:50.25,00:12:50.25,bag. J.T. has had a nice head start.
198,00:12:57.58,00:12:57.58,Stephen's had a pretty good amount of time.
199,00:13:00.58,00:13:00.58,Erinn is the last to get here. There will be one piece in the
200,00:13:07.33,00:13:07.33,"center, then two pieces in the second row, three pieces in the"
201,00:13:10.42,00:13:10.42,"third row, always. Stephen proved earlier he is a"
202,00:13:19.71,00:13:19.71,wiz with numbers. Does that hold true for puzzles?
203,00:13:27.46,00:13:27.46,J.T. getting closer. Only five pieces left for J.T.
204,00:13:31.50,00:13:31.50,if he has them in the right spot.
205,00:13:39.04,00:13:39.04,Erinn making up a lot of ground now.
206,00:13:42.62,00:13:42.62,Erinn was the last person to start working on her puzzle.
207,00:13:47.42,00:13:47.42,Taj starting to fall behind now. Stephen still fighting to stay
208,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,"in this. Right now, it is between J.T.,"
209,00:13:55.71,00:13:55.71,"Stephen and Erinn. J.T. down to one piece left, but"
210,00:14:03.25,00:14:03.25,he can't find a spot for it. He's got one in the wrong spot.
211,00:14:10.12,00:14:10.12,Erinn has closed the gap now. It is Erinn and J.T.
212,00:14:14.58,00:14:14.58,(J.T. groans) >> Yes.
213,00:14:27.12,00:14:27.12,>> PROBST: J.T. wins immunity! (Stephen groans)
214,00:14:30.21,00:14:30.21,">> I am so close. All right, J."
215,00:14:34.29,00:14:34.29,"Oh, man. >> PROBST: J.T., once again,"
216,00:14:41.88,00:14:41.88,back-to-back. Nice job.
217,00:14:46.08,00:14:46.08,">> Whoo-hoo! >> PROBST: Once again, J.T. is"
218,00:14:48.83,00:14:48.83,"safe at Tribal Council. Tonight, Erinn, Stephen, Taj,"
219,00:14:53.25,00:14:53.25,it's been 37 days. That will be all it is for one
220,00:14:56.08,00:14:56.08,"of you. Grab your stuff, head back to"
221,00:14:57.54,00:14:57.54,camp. See you at Tribal.
222,00:15:01.12,00:15:01.12,">> I had it. I got my last pieces out, ready"
223,00:15:03.42,00:15:03.42,"to put them into the very, very last one."
224,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,J.T. won immunity. Frustrating to no end.
225,00:15:10.21,00:15:10.21,I am sitting next to three people who have been together
226,00:15:12.88,00:15:12.88,"since day one, and I am very aware that they could just take"
227,00:15:17.12,00:15:17.12,me out and keep Taj. >> Congratulations.
228,00:15:45.29,00:15:45.29,>> Thanks. >> Nice job.
229,00:15:48.08,00:15:48.08,>> Work well done. >> It was a close one.
230,00:15:53.83,00:15:53.83,">> It was a close one. >> Well, J.T. wins immunity"
231,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,"today. Any one of the Jalapao members,"
232,00:15:58.46,00:15:58.46,"had they won, it would have worked in our favor, and the"
233,00:16:01.46,00:16:01.46,plan is to vote for Erinn because Jalapao is Jalapao the
234,00:16:04.46,00:16:04.46,"three, and as long as we stay loyal, we can go to the final"
235,00:16:07.25,00:16:07.25,three together. >> Let's get in that water.
236,00:16:10.71,00:16:10.71,>> I'm not getting in the water. It's going to burn so bad.
237,00:16:13.67,00:16:13.67,"Erinn, I'm sure she's vying for a spot."
238,00:16:15.54,00:16:15.54,She's gonna be trying to convince them that she's worthy
239,00:16:18.08,00:16:18.08,of being here. But I want her to realize that
240,00:16:22.88,00:16:22.88,she can try all day long. The guys are loyal to me until
241,00:16:26.21,00:16:26.21,"the final three, and, and we got to move on like that."
242,00:16:29.62,00:16:29.62,">> I got to ease in before I-- well, actually, coming over and"
243,00:16:32.54,00:16:32.54,sitting down would be the same as easing in.
244,00:16:35.46,00:16:35.46,You know how I don't like to do it all at once.
245,00:16:40.42,00:16:40.42,"Coming back from the challenge, all I'm thinking about is, like,"
246,00:16:45.12,00:16:45.12,what's my next move? How am I going to plead my case?
247,00:16:48.08,00:16:48.08,"What do I do, what do I say? I don't want to make it seem as"
248,00:16:52.17,00:16:52.17,though I'm scrambling. I'm just going to say my piece.
249,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,I think Taj-- she has played such a good social game.
250,00:16:58.46,00:16:58.46,"Like, she has made really good friends with everyone, and I"
251,00:17:03.08,00:17:03.08,"mean, she definitely played a great game, aside from just,"
252,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"like, being very likable. >> Uh-huh."
253,00:17:12.21,00:17:12.21,>> And I totally think she could win.
254,00:17:16.25,00:17:16.25,">> Erinn's really playing her game down at the water, and she"
255,00:17:19.08,00:17:19.08,made a good point. Taj has a very good chance of
256,00:17:21.71,00:17:21.71,beating me when the jury votes 'cause everyone loves Taj.
257,00:17:24.42,00:17:24.42,">> Ay, ay, ay. >> This is a game for a million"
258,00:17:27.04,00:17:27.04,"dollars. Right now, it doesn't matter"
259,00:17:28.92,00:17:28.92,"who's Timbira, who's Jalapao. I want to make sure I've got a"
260,00:17:31.88,00:17:31.88,good shot at a million dollars. How do we do this?
261,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,"Tonight's the last hard vote. >> Erinn, we can beat for sure"
262,00:17:45.54,00:17:45.54,in the final immunity. Then we're basically guaranteed
263,00:17:49.00,00:17:49.00,"the final two. All right, good."
264,00:18:02.58,00:18:02.58,>> We're taking each other no matter what.
265,00:18:04.21,00:18:04.21,>> No matter what. J.T. and I are sort of trying to
266,00:18:06.88,00:18:06.88,figure out if we'd rather go to the final three with Taj or with
267,00:18:09.42,00:18:09.42,"Erinn. If I betray Taj, you know, I"
268,00:18:12.54,00:18:12.54,definitely won't look good in the jury's eyes.
269,00:18:15.54,00:18:15.54,But how do I get to the finals and how do I win them?
270,00:18:19.04,00:18:19.04,That's been really guiding all of my decisions.
271,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,I think Taj is getting suspicious.
272,00:18:22.71,00:18:22.71,">> Yeah. >> If we vote off Erinn tonight,"
273,00:18:27.17,00:18:27.17,"then it will be Taj, me and J.T. in the next immunity"
274,00:18:29.75,00:18:29.75,challenge. I think Taj has a stronger
275,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,"chance than Erinn would in that challenge, and I think there's"
276,00:18:35.21,00:18:35.21,also a very good chance that Taj would take J.T. to the final
277,00:18:37.79,00:18:37.79,"two. Maybe she thinks, ""I'm gonna"
278,00:18:40.79,00:18:40.79,take this kid from rural Alabama rather than the New York City
279,00:18:43.21,00:18:43.21,"boy."" So it's a really difficult"
280,00:18:46.33,00:18:46.33,decision on both strategic and moral and personal grounds.
281,00:18:49.38,00:18:49.38,">> Yeah, that's who we're going for?"
282,00:18:52.42,00:18:52.42,>> Yeah. >> Definitely?
283,00:18:54.46,00:18:54.46,>> Who else? >> I just want to make sure.
284,00:18:56.33,00:18:56.33,You never know. >> Y'all can't go for me.
285,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,">> No, I would never... >> Thank God."
286,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,">> Oh, so that means you and Erinn are going to vote for me."
287,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,Um... hello? >> Huh?
288,00:19:07.04,00:19:07.04,">> You're not voting for me? >> No, no, I was making sure"
289,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,y'all wasn't voting for me. >> Tonight is a very hard Tribal
290,00:19:13.08,00:19:13.08,"Council. Taj, myself and Stephen-- we"
291,00:19:16.12,00:19:16.12,"are the tightest three in this game, no doubt about it, and so"
292,00:19:20.33,00:19:20.33,"we're definitely reassuring Taj that Erinn's going home, and"
293,00:19:23.50,00:19:23.50,Erinn may be going home. We're not sure what we're going
294,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,"to do tonight, but Stephen and I are going to stick together on"
295,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,whatever decision we make. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
296,00:19:59.25,00:19:59.25,"the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Debbie,"
297,00:20:10.46,00:20:10.46,"and Coach, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
298,00:20:17.46,00:20:17.46,"Stephen, going back to the merge, it was six Timbira"
299,00:20:21.46,00:20:21.46,"members, three Jalapao. Here we are tonight."
300,00:20:25.12,00:20:25.12,Five of the six Timbira are on the jury.
301,00:20:27.71,00:20:27.71,"How did this happen? >> Um, basically, we sort of had"
302,00:20:30.42,00:20:30.42,"a game plan, you know. We each kind of selected a few"
303,00:20:32.83,00:20:32.83,members of Timbira who we thought we might connect with
304,00:20:34.88,00:20:34.88,and I think that's really helped us.
305,00:20:36.79,00:20:36.79,I think what was the most important thing was just we
306,00:20:38.96,00:20:38.96,"would always stick together. >> PROBST: Erinn, you are the"
307,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,lone remaining Timbira member. All of your former tribemates
308,00:20:46.50,00:20:46.50,make up the jury. >> That's true.
309,00:20:48.71,00:20:48.71,"I mean, I'm, like, pretty proud of myself, not, like, in a"
310,00:20:51.79,00:20:51.79,"vengeful way, but, like, it speaks greatly of my self-"
311,00:20:54.88,00:20:54.88,"perseverance, and I definitely made decisions that kept me"
312,00:20:59.04,00:20:59.04,"here, and that is amazing to me. >> PROBST: So, Erinn, when you"
313,00:21:03.50,00:21:03.50,"guys get back from the challenge, is it scramble time"
314,00:21:06.38,00:21:06.38,"for you? >> Um, one thing that I have"
315,00:21:09.12,00:21:09.12,learned watching everyone go out before me is that scrambling
316,00:21:13.50,00:21:13.50,"does not work. >> PROBST: So, if history holds"
317,00:21:16.50,00:21:16.50,"true to form, the final Timbira member-- you-- will join the"
318,00:21:19.71,00:21:19.71,"jury, and the Jalapao three will battle it out to see who goes to"
319,00:21:22.42,00:21:22.42,the end. >> Absolutely.
320,00:21:24.04,00:21:24.04,These three really have been working together since day one
321,00:21:27.42,00:21:27.42,or two of this game. I wouldn't be surprised if they
322,00:21:30.42,00:21:30.42,"continued to do so. >> PROBST: Taj, how big a risk"
323,00:21:33.29,00:21:33.29,would it be to let Erinn have a shot of going to the end when
324,00:21:37.12,00:21:37.12,all of her former tribemates are on the jury?
325,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,">> Well, that might be a plus for her because we are the three"
326,00:21:43.21,00:21:43.21,Jalapao members that came in and put all of the Timbira members
327,00:21:45.92,00:21:45.92,on the jury. They may not want to vote for
328,00:21:48.00,00:21:48.00,"one of us, so she might get the votes just to be vindictive."
329,00:21:50.62,00:21:50.62,So it could be pretty dangerous. >> PROBST: It seems like that
330,00:21:53.29,00:21:53.29,"the safest bet, Stephen, is to have the Jalapao three go to the"
331,00:21:56.12,00:21:56.12,"end because then, at least we're all even."
332,00:22:01.33,00:22:01.33,">> I mean, there's definitely that to consider."
333,00:22:02.75,00:22:02.75,"I also think it's an individual game, and you have to consider"
334,00:22:05.75,00:22:05.75,"everyone in the eyes of the jury, you know, and so you also"
335,00:22:08.79,00:22:08.79,"have to think, like, ""Who do I measure up against best?"""
336,00:22:10.58,00:22:10.58,">> PROBST: Does that mean, then, that, now that Coach is out,"
337,00:22:12.54,00:22:12.54,"this whole philosophy of ""take the best to the end"" is gone?"
338,00:22:15.21,00:22:15.21,">> I mean, look, I respected Coach's philosophy and I always"
339,00:22:18.04,00:22:18.04,"wanted to be there with the best, but obviously, I have"
340,00:22:20.71,00:22:20.71,formed real bonds with everybody here.
341,00:22:23.12,00:22:23.12,"And so, you know, I almost hope I'm not in the position to make"
342,00:22:25.58,00:22:25.58,"that... that decision. >> PROBST: Well, but you are."
343,00:22:27.75,00:22:27.75,"You have a vote. I almost feel as though, as the"
344,00:22:29.71,00:22:29.71,"thunder continues to crackle around us, it's almost like you"
345,00:22:33.83,00:22:33.83,"just showed up and this is your first day here, and you... you"
346,00:22:36.08,00:22:36.08,don't even know how the game is played.
347,00:22:37.71,00:22:37.71,"You can only vote for Erinn or Taj, so which is it?"
348,00:22:41.50,00:22:41.50,>> Okay. (sighs)
349,00:22:43.42,00:22:43.42,"I guess, for me, you know, the vote tonight is about: how do I"
350,00:22:46.71,00:22:46.71,better assure myself a place in the finals?
351,00:22:50.04,00:22:50.04,">> PROBST: J.T., you've come a long way together."
352,00:22:52.71,00:22:52.71,"Trust these other three? >> Yeah, I obviously trust"
353,00:22:55.46,00:22:55.46,"Stephen and Taj more so than Erinn, because I've spent a lot"
354,00:22:58.50,00:22:58.50,more time with them. And they've made promises that
355,00:23:01.21,00:23:01.21,"have been kept. I've come to trust Erinn, but"
356,00:23:04.42,00:23:04.42,not near as much as I trust the other two.
357,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83,>> PROBST: Taj. >> I agree.
358,00:23:09.21,00:23:09.21,"From day one, J.T. and Stephen have been by my side, so I have"
359,00:23:11.62,00:23:11.62,"no reason to distrust them. And Erinn, I-I think she's a"
360,00:23:14.38,00:23:14.38,"great girl and I-I believe in her, but I haven't been around"
361,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,her long enough to put my complete faith in her.
362,00:23:19.33,00:23:19.33,>> PROBST: Would you be a little shocked if it was you tonight?
363,00:23:22.08,00:23:22.08,">> Oh, it... yeah, I would be very shocked if it was me"
364,00:23:24.21,00:23:24.21,tonight. I would be very shocked.
365,00:23:25.83,00:23:25.83,"But everyone has a plan, and-and everyone's trying to win a"
366,00:23:28.29,00:23:28.29,"million dollars, so there's... there's no rules."
367,00:23:30.75,00:23:30.75,">> PROBST: Erinn, let's flip it. If, at the end of tonight's"
368,00:23:33.96,00:23:33.96,"vote, you, the only remaining Timbira member, are still here,"
369,00:23:37.54,00:23:37.54,you going to be shocked? >> Surprised.

371,00:23:43.83,00:23:43.83,I would definitely be surprised if I didn't go home tonight.

373,00:23:49.33,00:23:49.33,vote? >> Well... I'm going to give
374,00:23:53.25,00:23:53.25,myself a 33% chance of sticking around.
375,00:23:57.75,00:23:57.75,">> PROBST: So, the real question is: Will the Jalapao three"
376,00:24:01.00,00:24:01.00,"remain strong and vote out Erinn, or is somebody about"
377,00:24:03.96,00:24:03.96,to be shocked? Let's get to the vote.
378,00:24:06.21,00:24:06.21,"J.T., you have the necklace. I assume you're keeping it."
379,00:24:08.21,00:24:08.21,">> Yes, I am. >> PROBST: Cannot vote for J.T."
380,00:24:10.12,00:24:10.12,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
381,00:24:12.62,00:24:12.62,"Erinn, you're up. >> You've played a great game."
382,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,Hope to see you on the other side.
383,00:24:37.17,00:24:37.17,>> It had to be you or me. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
384,00:24:58.25,00:24:58.25,votes. (thunder crashing)
385,00:25:10.12,00:25:10.12,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
386,00:25:12.92,00:25:12.92,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
387,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,immediately. I'll read the votes.
388,00:25:20.38,00:25:20.38,First vote. Taj.
389,00:25:27.79,00:25:27.79,"Erinn. One vote Taj, one vote Erinn."
390,00:25:35.04,00:25:35.04,"Taj. Two votes Taj, one vote Erinn."
391,00:25:46.96,00:25:46.96,13th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury.
392,00:25:50.71,00:25:50.71,Taj. Need to bring me your torch.
393,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,"Taj, your tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
394,00:26:22.50,00:26:22.50,Congratulations. You've made it to the final
395,00:26:25.29,00:26:25.29,"three. Tomorrow, you will compete in"
396,00:26:28.04,00:26:28.04,your final immunity challenge. Try to get a good night's sleep.
397,00:26:31.42,00:26:31.42,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
398,00:26:33.38,00:26:33.38,"Good night. >> Um, it's day 37."
399,00:26:47.33,00:26:47.33,I got blindsided by my Jalapao members that have been looking
400,00:26:51.42,00:26:51.42,"out for me from day one. And for them to, uh, blindside"
401,00:26:55.12,00:26:55.12,"me, it blew my mind, so it's going to be really hard to"
402,00:26:58.12,00:26:58.12,choose who's worthy of a million dollars.
403,00:27:00.92,00:27:00.92,"But, either way, if Erinn finds a way to weasel herself into the"

405,00:27:11.46,00:27:11.46,>> He's going to fight like hell to win.
406,00:27:13.12,00:27:13.12,">> We, too, must fight like hell."
407,00:27:14.67,00:27:14.67,>> PROBST: Erinn pits Stephen and J.T. against each other.
408,00:27:17.33,00:27:17.33,>> Been a lot of talk about how it would be suicide to go up
409,00:27:20.21,00:27:20.21,against you. >> That what Stephen said?
410,00:27:22.58,00:27:22.58,>> I have a good shot at going to the end.
411,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,"If the two of them are both willing to take me, it puts me"
412,00:27:27.50,00:27:27.50,in a good spot. >> PROBST: Find out tonight who
413,00:27:30.08,00:27:30.08,will claim the million dollar prize.
414,00:27:45.83,00:27:45.83,>> Final three. Final three fever.
415,00:27:49.50,00:27:49.50,">> Crazy, crazy. >> Yeah."
416,00:27:57.17,00:27:57.17,>> Tonight's Tribal Council was probably the toughest yet.
417,00:27:59.83,00:27:59.83,"I really did not want to vote Taj off tonight, but we made a"
418,00:28:03.08,00:28:03.08,decision based upon how easy it would be to win at the next
419,00:28:07.62,00:28:07.62,"challenge, and we had to get rid of Taj."
420,00:28:11.67,00:28:11.67,">> Okay, so every single Tribal Council since the merge has gone"
421,00:28:15.79,00:28:15.79,exactly like we had planned for it to.
422,00:28:18.46,00:28:18.46,That is crazy. I really felt like she knew and
423,00:28:22.38,00:28:22.38,she was kind of continuing to go with it.
424,00:28:26.00,00:28:26.00,"But she didn't seem upset at all when it happened, and she didn't"
425,00:28:29.29,00:28:29.29,seem surprised. >> I'm already suffering the
426,00:28:32.29,00:28:32.29,"consequences, because Erinn is the most annoying person I know"
427,00:28:36.04,00:28:36.04,"in the world, and she will not shut up."
428,00:28:38.42,00:28:38.42,">> It didn't even, like, seem all that crazy to me until he"
429,00:28:42.00,00:28:42.00,"said, ""Tomorrow will be your final immunity challenge."""
430,00:28:45.67,00:28:45.67,">> Don't feel too bad, buddy. >> I know, man."
431,00:28:49.08,00:28:49.08,>> This is a celebratory time. We're the final three.
432,00:28:56.33,00:28:56.33,>> It's great to be in the top three.
433,00:28:58.33,00:28:58.33,"I mean, it's a great milestone for us, but it's sort of... you"
434,00:29:01.04,00:29:01.04,"know, it's definitely tainted by the fact that we voted out Taj,"
435,00:29:03.67,00:29:03.67,"and that hurts, and also just Erinn chattering away, and"
436,00:29:06.21,00:29:06.21,"that's annoying and, you know, totally ignorant of any... any"
437,00:29:10.17,00:29:10.17,sort of emotional turmoil that J.T. and I are going through.
438,00:29:12.92,00:29:12.92,">> We're pretty awesome, guys. Final three is, like, the thing"
439,00:29:16.17,00:29:16.17,"that you play for. >> But, right now, you have to"
440,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,think about how you're going to get to the finals.
441,00:29:20.62,00:29:20.62,You can't make a strategic decision based on sort of the
442,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,"emotional niceness of it. >> Well, uh..."
443,00:29:41.12,00:29:41.12,">> Day 38. Oh, my God."
444,00:29:45.67,00:29:45.67,>> We just ate so early. >> Yeah.
445,00:29:51.21,00:29:51.21,">> No, not at all. >> Okay."
446,00:29:53.25,00:29:53.25,>> Not at all. Absolutely.
447,00:29:56.67,00:29:56.67,We have our last immunity challenge today.
448,00:29:59.75,00:29:59.75,I already have my decision made if I win.
449,00:30:02.42,00:30:02.42,I'm taking Stephen with me. It's the choice that's going to
450,00:30:05.08,00:30:05.08,give me the best chance of winning.
451,00:30:09.21,00:30:09.21,"Yeah, I agree. >> I do trust you, but I trust"
452,00:30:12.12,00:30:12.12,me more. (Erinn chuckling)
453,00:30:14.12,00:30:14.12,>> I also agree. Even if I don't win immunity
454,00:30:17.04,00:30:17.04,"today, I have a good shot at going to the end."
455,00:30:19.38,00:30:19.38,Neither of these guys want to go up against each other.
456,00:30:22.04,00:30:22.04,"I mean, we're all in positions where we could definitely win"
457,00:30:25.33,00:30:25.33,"this thing, but if the two of them don't want to fight it out"
458,00:30:28.42,00:30:28.42,"with each other and they are both willing to take me, it puts"
459,00:30:31.33,00:30:31.33,me in a good spot. He's going to fight like hell to
460,00:30:35.04,00:30:35.04,win today. >> I know he is.
461,00:30:37.21,00:30:37.21,"We, too, must fight like hell. >> Yeah."
462,00:30:39.67,00:30:39.67,>> We have to win. >> Yeah.
463,00:30:41.50,00:30:41.50,">> I mean, we stand a chance against each other, but I don't"
464,00:30:43.62,00:30:43.62,think either of us stand a chance against him in the
465,00:30:45.08,00:30:45.08,"finals, right? >> Yeah, absolutely."
466,00:30:47.08,00:30:47.08,>> I'm a little afraid of winning today's immunity
467,00:30:48.96,00:30:48.96,"challenge, because then I'll have a really difficult choice"
468,00:30:51.88,00:30:51.88,"ahead of me. Um, take J.T., who has been my"
469,00:30:54.75,00:30:54.75,"comrade in arms, my closest friend, my ally and my fellow"
470,00:30:58.75,00:30:58.75,strategist since the very beginning of this game.
471,00:31:01.92,00:31:01.92,"Or take Erinn with me, who I think I have a better shot"
472,00:31:05.38,00:31:05.38,against in the final two. >> All right.
473,00:31:19.88,00:31:19.88,I just wanted to make sure we had an official agreement before
474,00:31:23.08,00:31:23.08,we went in this challenge. I'm sitting in a good spot to go
475,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,"to the final two, but can't help being worried sick, man."
476,00:31:32.29,00:31:32.29,I'm... I'm worried. There's no way she's going to
477,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,beat both of us. >> I don't think so.
478,00:31:38.54,00:31:38.54,>> You never can tell. If Erinn was to win this
479,00:31:41.96,00:31:41.96,"challenge, I know I'm not going to the final two."
480,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,"And, uh, you know, I'd like to think Stephen will hold up his"
481,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,"end of the deal just as well as I will, but you never know."
482,00:31:51.33,00:31:51.33,"This is huge, man. >> Yep."
483,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,">> I'm... I'm taking you to the final two, Stephen, if I win."
484,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,"There's no doubt about it, man. No doubt about it."
485,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,">> Me, too. >> Okay."
486,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,">> What a funny pair we are, you know."
487,00:32:12.96,00:32:12.96,>> I know. I'm sure you could trust Stephen
488,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,"with anything in everyday life, as you could with me, but with a"
489,00:32:18.04,00:32:18.04,million dollars in a game that you know you're here to lie to
490,00:32:20.79,00:32:20.79,"win, it's a different story. So, I've got one thing in mind."
491,00:32:24.08,00:32:24.08,That's winning this challenge. (hoots)
492,00:32:28.54,00:32:28.54,This is day 38. Who would've ever thought that
493,00:32:31.29,00:32:31.29,I'd be standing here? >> I know it.
494,00:32:33.62,00:32:33.62,>> I know. I love that it's the three of
495,00:32:37.92,00:32:37.92,us. >> I love that it's me and two
496,00:32:39.92,00:32:39.92,other people. >> Yeah.
497,00:32:41.67,00:32:41.67,">> Yeah, me, too. >> Let's see what we got here."
498,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,>> We've got tree mail? >> We got tree mail.
499,00:32:48.46,00:32:48.46,We can just open it here. >> We can.
500,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,">> Awesome. >> ""Follow the map across the"
501,00:32:53.33,00:32:53.33,river. There you will find the torches
502,00:32:55.58,00:32:55.58,"of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect"
503,00:32:58.75,00:32:58.75,a representative idol of those who were voted out before you.
504,00:33:02.12,00:33:02.12,"At the end of your journey, you will burn them and pay your"
505,00:33:04.75,00:33:04.75,"respects, as they each had a part in getting you to this"
506,00:33:07.71,00:33:07.71,point. You will then proceed to your
507,00:33:10.29,00:33:10.29,"final immunity challenge."" >> All right!"
508,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,(applause) >> The rites of passage is sort
509,00:33:17.58,00:33:17.58,"of a narrative of our adventure. Just every step along the way,"
510,00:33:20.71,00:33:20.71,"the people we've had to face, the dragons we've had to slay,"
511,00:33:23.75,00:33:23.75,to coin a phrase. >> Wonder if I can just keep
512,00:33:27.04,00:33:27.04,this. (Erinn laughs)
513,00:33:28.96,00:33:28.96,>> Heavy is the head that wears the necklace.
514,00:33:33.75,00:33:33.75,I think this is mostly going to be about just paying respect to
515,00:33:37.29,00:33:37.29,the people who fell along the way.
516,00:33:39.75,00:33:39.75,I do think we owe it to them to kind of show that they matter to
517,00:33:43.54,00:33:43.54,"us, that we valued them as people, and as enemy combatants"
518,00:33:48.25,00:33:48.25,on the field of Survivor battle. Carolina.
519,00:33:57.29,00:33:57.29,>> Sweet Carolina. >> So much trouble in such a
520,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,little body. (Erinn laughs)
521,00:34:04.29,00:34:04.29,>> A part of me has to be okay with the fact that I was the
522,00:34:08.21,00:34:08.21,first voted out. But it hurt so bad to be sent
523,00:34:11.25,00:34:11.25,"home so early, especially to be blindsided."
524,00:34:14.62,00:34:14.62,"However, I learned that maybe I should be a little bit more"
525,00:34:17.96,00:34:17.96,"patient sometimes, and I should just sit back and allow things"
526,00:34:21.92,00:34:21.92,to just happen and not always feel the need to try to control
527,00:34:25.12,00:34:25.12,"things. >> Oh, Candace!"
528,00:34:33.21,00:34:33.21,>> Yes. >> I may have been her only
529,00:34:36.79,00:34:36.79,"friend in this game. But, gosh darn it, I liked her"
530,00:34:39.71,00:34:39.71,a lot. >> There's a part of me that's
531,00:34:42.71,00:34:42.71,"just, like, ""Gosh, Candace, why couldn't you tolerate the"
532,00:34:45.88,00:34:45.88,"egocentric, sexist crap that was coming out of Coach's mouth?"
533,00:34:50.96,00:34:50.96,"Like, why couldn't you play along?"""
534,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,But it was just too much for me. This whole social compatibility

537,00:35:08.25,00:35:08.25,be your dad. He was cool.
538,00:35:11.29,00:35:11.29,>> The worst time in this game for me was the day I got voted
539,00:35:14.29,00:35:14.29,"off. Man, I was feeling so bad."
540,00:35:16.92,00:35:16.92,"I mean, I was hurting. I had been hurting for days, and"
541,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,I didn't want nobody to know about it.
542,00:35:21.29,00:35:21.29,"I was hiding it. I mean, I had been in the"

544,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,"training, but, boy, Survivor, by far was the toughest."
545,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,(Jerry laughs) >> Sandy.
546,00:35:36.67,00:35:36.67,>> She was an excellent woman. She was definitely a bit crazy.
547,00:35:39.25,00:35:39.25,>> She definitely provided me with one of the more humbling
548,00:35:42.62,00:35:42.62,"moments of my lifetime, as well. >> I don't believe I could have"
549,00:35:46.92,00:35:46.92,played this game any harder than I did.
550,00:35:49.08,00:35:49.08,I was able to overcome the first impression with my tribe.
551,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,The tribe did a complete flop. I think I entertained them
552,00:35:57.29,00:35:57.29,"enough that, you know, they... I made them laugh, so I kind"
553,00:36:00.29,00:36:00.29,"of... You know, I drew them in, and"
554,00:36:02.67,00:36:02.67,"they saw the strength come out, so I'm pretty proud of myself."
555,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,>> Spencer. >> He knew the game probably
556,00:36:15.42,00:36:15.42,better than anybody I know. >> He was a super fan and a very
557,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,strong strategist. >> I feel very honored that I
558,00:36:22.25,00:36:22.25,"am the youngest contestant ever on Survivor, but I think my age"
559,00:36:27.38,00:36:27.38,might have also had something to do with the game and the fact
560,00:36:30.46,00:36:30.46,that I got voted out fifth. I tended to trust more people
561,00:36:34.46,00:36:34.46,than my older tribe mates would have done.
562,00:36:36.33,00:36:36.33,"I wanted to see the good in people, and in a game like this,"
563,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,you really... you have to check that at the door.
564,00:36:41.92,00:36:41.92,But not only did I play the game of Survivor.
565,00:36:44.25,00:36:44.25,"I was the first-ever teenager to play the game, and that's pretty"
566,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,cool. >> Sydney?
567,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,>> What a beautiful girl. >> A wonderful lady.
568,00:36:58.04,00:36:58.04,">> That was one of the first hard votes we had to make,"
569,00:37:00.71,00:37:00.71,Stephen. She was a...
570,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,She was a tough one. It was between her and Taj.
571,00:37:05.38,00:37:05.38,">> A big revelation for me, I think, was maybe I shouldn't"
572,00:37:08.96,00:37:08.96,have ridden some coattails. I should have been making those
573,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,moves myself. I don't need protection from
574,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,"other people. Like, if I feel something, then"
575,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"why don't I just do it? I need to be more, I guess,"
576,00:37:21.79,00:37:21.79,"self-assured, and that's something I learned for sure."
577,00:37:29.96,00:37:29.96,">> Joe. >> Oh, Joe."
578,00:37:32.79,00:37:32.79,>> Captain America. The most decent guy out here.
579,00:37:35.08,00:37:35.08,Medically evacuated. That is not the way anybody
580,00:37:38.04,00:37:38.04,"wants to go. >> Literally, I was just"
581,00:37:41.83,00:37:41.83,"getting started, but my body failed me."
582,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,"The main lesson I learned is that just generally speaking,"
583,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,"like, Mother Nature is a pretty awesome force."
584,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"I think I'm tough enough to win this game, but I injured my"
585,00:37:52.46,00:37:52.46,"knee, and it took me down. >> Brendan."
586,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,The first dragon to be slain in the Forza tribe.
587,00:38:06.75,00:38:06.75,">> He was a good player. A good athlete, too."
588,00:38:08.75,00:38:08.75,>> Too true. >> Just because you have been
589,00:38:11.29,00:38:11.29,successful in business doesn't necessarily translate to the
590,00:38:13.79,00:38:13.79,"Survivor experience. You know, you come into it."
591,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,"I was, like, ""Oh, I can win this thing."""
592,00:38:18.58,00:38:18.58,But it's a lot harder than it looks.
593,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,"It's a humbling experience, and I have a lot more respect for"
594,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,it now that I got my ass beat by it.
595,00:38:32.62,00:38:32.62,">> Tyson. >> Your buddy, Tyson."
596,00:38:35.67,00:38:35.67,">> Funny guy, really kind, really sincere guy, and taking"
597,00:38:39.00,00:38:39.00,"him out was, like, the turning point in the game for us, I"
598,00:38:41.79,00:38:41.79,think. >> Yeah.
599,00:38:43.83,00:38:43.83,">> I think the blindside, actually, for most people comes"
600,00:38:46.88,00:38:46.88,"when they're the most confident, and I was definitely"
601,00:38:48.92,00:38:48.92,"overconfident. I was, like, ""I've got this game"
602,00:38:51.08,00:38:51.08,"wrapped up."" But it's usually not the"
603,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,strongest person that wins. The more pathetic you look and
604,00:38:55.58,00:38:55.58,act usually seems to get you pretty far in the game.
605,00:38:58.67,00:38:58.67,"So, those people can have their money."
606,00:39:01.00,00:39:01.00,"I'll keep my awesome personality and, uh, fantastic good looks."
607,00:39:08.88,00:39:08.88,>> Sierra. >> Sierra.
608,00:39:10.88,00:39:10.88,Sweet Sierra. She was surprisingly honest and
609,00:39:13.00,00:39:13.00,just a really sweet girl. I mean...
610,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,>> Yeah. >> It was great getting to know
611,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,her. >> I would sum up my Survivor
612,00:39:20.46,00:39:20.46,experience as trial and tribulation.
613,00:39:23.62,00:39:23.62,(Sierra laughs) It was highs and lows throughout
614,00:39:26.71,00:39:26.71,the whole entire game for me. I wore my heart on my sleeve.
615,00:39:30.67,00:39:30.67,I stayed true to who I was. I did everything I could but
616,00:39:35.04,00:39:35.04,"give up, and I was really happy about that."
617,00:39:37.42,00:39:37.42,It was the hardest and most amazing thing I've ever done in
618,00:39:40.25,00:39:40.25,my life. And it will forever change who
619,00:39:42.33,00:39:42.33,I am as a person. >> Debbie.
620,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,>> Little Debbie. >> Little Debbie.
621,00:39:53.08,00:39:53.08,>> Debbie was easily the person that I was closest to out here.
622,00:39:56.08,00:39:56.08,"Um, it was the hardest vote for sure."
623,00:39:58.67,00:39:58.67,>> She was a super strong player.
624,00:40:00.71,00:40:00.71,>> Yeah. >> Always up in the top in the
625,00:40:03.08,00:40:03.08,"immunity challenges, extremely strategic, really kind."
626,00:40:06.17,00:40:06.17,"I mean, she was one of the biggest threats in the game."
627,00:40:08.75,00:40:08.75,">> Sorry you had to go, Debbie. >> As a middle school principal,"
628,00:40:13.04,00:40:13.04,I deal with all different kinds of people every single day.
629,00:40:16.08,00:40:16.08,So I really thought this game was going to be something that I
630,00:40:19.12,00:40:19.12,"would get in here, figure everybody out."
631,00:40:21.08,00:40:21.08,"Um, unfortunately, I've also learned that I maybe am not as"
632,00:40:25.29,00:40:25.29,great at figuring people out as I thought.
633,00:40:27.54,00:40:27.54,But there's not many things that can be thrown at me in life
634,00:40:30.08,00:40:30.08,anymore that I won't know that I can't handle.
635,00:40:36.71,00:40:36.71,>> Coach. >> My most satisfying blindside
636,00:40:39.29,00:40:39.29,to date. >> Probably one of the most
637,00:40:42.04,00:40:42.04,"honest people I know, and definitely, definitely set out"
638,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,"to change the game. >> He did change the game, you"
639,00:40:46.58,00:40:46.58,"know, in his own way. >> Yeah."
640,00:40:48.42,00:40:48.42,>> He got final five with never telling a lie and being purely
641,00:40:51.21,00:40:51.21,"honest. And, you know, what a great"
642,00:40:53.12,00:40:53.12,"storyteller, too. >> Yeah, absolutely."
643,00:40:55.08,00:40:55.08,">> He was awesome. Yeah, I got a lot of respect for"
644,00:40:57.92,00:40:57.92,"Coach. >> Nietzsche once said, ""There"
645,00:41:01.29,00:41:01.29,"is always some madness in love, but there's always some reason"
646,00:41:05.33,00:41:05.33,"in madness."" And I think that even as crazy"
647,00:41:07.88,00:41:07.88,"as the game was, and as crazy it was that I got blindsided, I can"
648,00:41:11.04,00:41:11.04,think of no finer way to go out than a man who has fought in
649,00:41:15.12,00:41:15.12,battle. I go back to the Vikings and
650,00:41:17.42,00:41:17.42,"the Indians and the samurai. You look at how they died, and"
651,00:41:20.04,00:41:20.04,"how did I leave? Head held high in the end, not"
652,00:41:23.54,00:41:23.54,"defeated, not broken. And hopefully, like a Greek"
653,00:41:27.12,00:41:27.12,"tragedy, in death, I will give other people a rebirth of ideas."
654,00:41:35.46,00:41:35.46,>> Taj. That was without a doubt the
655,00:41:37.75,00:41:37.75,hardest vote so far this game. She's an incredibly strong
656,00:41:40.08,00:41:40.08,"woman, very fierce in competitions."
657,00:41:42.04,00:41:42.04,>> Definitely. >> Loving at camp.
658,00:41:44.54,00:41:44.54,"You know, what else can you ask for?"
659,00:41:46.92,00:41:46.92,>> And so fun. >> Yeah.
660,00:41:48.42,00:41:48.42,>> Taj will be a friend of mine for the rest of my life.
661,00:41:51.04,00:41:51.04,"Sure, no doubt. >> Absolutely."
662,00:41:52.83,00:41:52.83,>> This experience is going to stick with me for the rest of
663,00:41:55.21,00:41:55.21,"my life. You know, I learned to do so"
664,00:41:57.21,00:41:57.21,"many things. I mean, I'm the fire starter"
665,00:41:59.21,00:41:59.21,now. I can show people how to start
666,00:42:01.21,00:42:01.21,fires in seconds. I can fish and feed a tribe.
667,00:42:03.46,00:42:03.46,I can help build shelters. I can do just about anything
668,00:42:05.75,00:42:05.75,right now. But I totally underestimated and
669,00:42:07.71,00:42:07.71,"lost focus on, um, the million dollars, as well as, um,"
670,00:42:12.04,00:42:12.04,underestimated Stephen and J.T.'s will to win that million
671,00:42:15.33,00:42:15.33,"dollars. I lost focus in the game, and"
672,00:42:18.04,00:42:18.04,that cost me the game. >> On the other side of rites of
673,00:42:41.08,00:42:41.08,"passage is our last immunity challenge, and I want to fight"
674,00:42:44.75,00:42:44.75,like hell to win so I can be guaranteed a spot in the final
675,00:42:49.38,00:42:49.38,"two. >> We've come a long way, guys."
676,00:42:55.21,00:42:55.21,">> Yeah, we have. >> There's no reason why I lose"
677,00:42:58.79,00:42:58.79,this challenge. And it's gonna take an act of
678,00:43:01.12,00:43:01.12,Congress to get me to step down from anything.
679,00:43:03.83,00:43:03.83,"I mean, I won't. My body would have to fail me."
680,00:43:15.21,00:43:15.21,>> This is the final immunity challenge.
681,00:43:17.33,00:43:17.33,The person who wins this will definitely be in the final two
682,00:43:20.04,00:43:20.04,and gets to control who he or she takes with him to the final
683,00:43:22.92,00:43:22.92,"two, and I would like to be the one making that decision."
684,00:43:25.46,00:43:25.46,So I am really going to give it my all in a way that I don't
685,00:43:28.71,00:43:28.71,think I have in previous immunity challenges.
686,00:43:30.83,00:43:30.83,"Because, you know, this is for a million dollars."
687,00:43:52.42,00:43:52.42,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
688,00:44:07.29,00:44:07.29,>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge?
689,00:44:10.17,00:44:10.17,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: J.T. take back the"
690,00:44:12.92,00:44:12.92,"necklace once again. For the last time, immunity is"
691,00:44:22.54,00:44:22.54,back up for grabs. Today's challenge is going to
692,00:44:25.71,00:44:25.71,require concentration and coordination.
693,00:44:28.92,00:44:28.92,You will place a ball down a chute.
694,00:44:32.04,00:44:32.04,"The ball will spiral downward until it drops out the bottom,"
695,00:44:35.21,00:44:35.21,"where you must catch it, place it back in the chute."
696,00:44:39.88,00:44:39.88,Every few minutes we'll add another ball.
697,00:44:43.29,00:44:43.29,"The balls will alternate left, then right, making it more"
698,00:44:46.21,00:44:46.21,difficult to keep track of which chute it's going to drop
699,00:44:49.08,00:44:49.08,out of. If at any point any one of your
700,00:44:51.83,00:44:51.83,"balls hits the ground, you're out of the challenge."
701,00:44:54.62,00:44:54.62,Last person to keep all of their balls in play wins.
702,00:44:59.21,00:44:59.21,"To make it more fun, one hand will be tied behind your back."
703,00:45:03.67,00:45:03.67,>> Wow. >> PROBST: At stake-- everything
704,00:45:05.71,00:45:05.71,you have worked for for 38 days.
705,00:45:08.71,00:45:08.71,"You win this challenge, you win immunity, you are guaranteed a"
706,00:45:11.92,00:45:11.92,spot in the final two and you will decide who sits next to you
707,00:45:16.50,00:45:16.50,at that final Tribal Council. This could very well be a
708,00:45:20.08,00:45:20.08,million dollar challenge. Ready to get to it?
709,00:45:23.71,00:45:23.71,>> Yeah. >> Yes.
710,00:45:25.08,00:45:25.08,>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots and we'll get started.
711,00:45:35.25,00:45:35.25,"Here we go, the final immunity challenge."
712,00:45:38.04,00:45:38.04,"Everybody grab your first ball. Three, two, one."
713,00:45:42.42,00:45:42.42,Drop it. This challenge is underway.
714,00:45:46.42,00:45:46.42,We'll start with one ball. Let you get the hang of it.
715,00:45:57.29,00:45:57.29,"Those ball will alternate. On the left side, then the"
716,00:46:00.83,00:46:00.83,right side. We're going to go to two balls
717,00:46:03.08,00:46:03.08,in a second. It's time now to add a second
718,00:46:17.21,00:46:17.21,ball. Everybody's got two balls in
719,00:46:25.17,00:46:25.17,play now. Make it a little more
720,00:46:28.04,00:46:28.04,complicated. Also becomes a question of
721,00:46:32.75,00:46:32.75,spacing. When do you place that ball back
722,00:46:35.58,00:46:35.58,in the chamber? So that they don't get too close
723,00:46:38.54,00:46:38.54,"together. In just a moment, we're going to"
724,00:46:47.08,00:46:47.08,add a third ball. So start getting ready for it.
725,00:46:59.54,00:46:59.54,It is now time to drop a third ball.
726,00:47:11.50,00:47:11.50,Everybody has got three balls going.
727,00:47:16.50,00:47:16.50,This challenge is more mental than it is physical.
728,00:47:19.92,00:47:19.92,Who has the mental focus to last after 38 days out here?
729,00:47:25.12,00:47:25.12,"One slip, one mental lapse, it's over."
730,00:47:33.75,00:47:33.75,Erinn drops a ball. Erinn is out of this challenge.
731,00:47:36.50,00:47:36.50,It is Steven and J.T. battling it out for final immunity and a
732,00:47:41.75,00:47:41.75,guaranteed spot at the final Tribal Council.
733,00:47:46.54,00:47:46.54,All Erinn can do now is watch and hope somebody chooses her
734,00:47:52.17,00:47:52.17,to go with them. Three balls now for Stephen and
735,00:47:57.33,00:47:57.33,J.T. Spacing is so critical.
736,00:48:04.67,00:48:04.67,"When you place the ball in the chute, making sure all three"
737,00:48:09.46,00:48:09.46,balls are spaced as far apart as possible.
738,00:48:13.08,00:48:13.08,To give you enough reaction time.
739,00:48:15.92,00:48:15.92,Stephen with a lucky save. Stephen with another nice save.
740,00:48:25.12,00:48:25.12,It is now time to place your fourth ball.
741,00:48:33.12,00:48:33.12,Four balls going now. Everything just ramped up.
742,00:48:42.71,00:48:42.71,Stay focused. Balls are flying.
743,00:48:49.46,00:48:49.46,Stephen with another nice save. It's a lot to keep track of.
744,00:48:58.29,00:48:58.29,Keep your concentration. Don't let your mind drift.
745,00:49:09.17,00:49:09.17,(grunts) >> PROBST: Stephen drops out.
746,00:49:11.12,00:49:11.12,J.T. wins final immunity and a guaranteed spot...
747,00:49:13.96,00:49:13.96,>> Yes! >> PROBST: ...in the final two.
748,00:49:15.79,00:49:15.79,">> Way to go, buddy. Way to go, man."
749,00:49:18.12,00:49:18.12,>> Thanks. >> Nice job.
750,00:49:20.58,00:49:20.58,">> Thanks. >> PROBST: J.T., you ready for"
751,00:49:23.54,00:49:23.54,this? >> Yeah.
752,00:49:25.96,00:49:25.96,"Thanks, Jeff. >> PROBST: The third time in a"
753,00:49:28.46,00:49:28.46,"row, and maybe the most important time, J.T. has"
754,00:49:31.67,00:49:31.67,immunity. You've gone as far as you can go
755,00:49:34.38,00:49:34.38,in this game. You will be in the final Tribal
756,00:49:36.58,00:49:36.58,Council. You will get a chance to plead
757,00:49:38.62,00:49:38.62,"your case for a million dollars. Tonight at Tribal Council, you"
758,00:49:42.21,00:49:42.21,will decide whether it is Erinn or Stephen that sits next to you
759,00:49:46.25,00:49:46.25,"at that final Tribal. Big decision, possibly a million"
760,00:49:49.62,00:49:49.62,dollar decision. You have the afternoon to figure
761,00:49:51.92,00:49:51.92,it out. Grab your stuff.
762,00:49:53.33,00:49:53.33,Head back to champ. >> You're guaranteed a one in
763,00:49:55.38,00:49:55.38,two shot at a million dollars. And I get to decide who is going
764,00:49:58.12,00:49:58.12,"up next to me. And Stephen and I had a promise,"
765,00:50:00.96,00:50:00.96,but promises come cheap in this game.
766,00:50:04.21,00:50:04.21,"And, you know, I'm thinking about that, but I try to keep"
767,00:50:07.08,00:50:07.08,most of mine. So I got a big decision ahead of
768,00:50:09.67,00:50:09.67,me. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
769,00:50:25.04,00:50:25.04,">> Oh, God. >> Thanks, man."
770,00:50:26.62,00:50:26.62,>> Nice. >> That was hard.
771,00:50:29.04,00:50:29.04,"When J.T. won today's immunity challenge, I just felt an"
772,00:50:32.17,00:50:32.17,enormous weight just lifted off of me.
773,00:50:35.17,00:50:35.17,>> If you go home before I go home...
774,00:50:39.21,00:50:39.21,>> All right. I was really dreading the
775,00:50:42.17,00:50:42.17,"decision of: do I take J.T. to the final two, my friend, ally,"
776,00:50:47.12,00:50:47.12,"you know, the person who I'm closest with in this game?"
777,00:50:50.12,00:50:50.12,"Or do I take Erinn who I'm not even particularly fond of, but"
778,00:50:53.29,00:50:53.29,who I have a very good shot of winning a million dollars
779,00:50:56.08,00:50:56.08,against? It would've been such a scumbag
780,00:50:58.12,00:50:58.12,decision to go with Erinn over J.T.
781,00:51:01.04,00:51:01.04,"And, like, having that just, like, taken away from me is so"
782,00:51:03.42,00:51:03.42,gratifying. >> So how you feeling?
783,00:51:19.71,00:51:19.71,You think Timbira's going to vote for you?
784,00:51:22.29,00:51:22.29,">> No. I really don't. In my situation, every single"
785,00:51:25.92,00:51:25.92,one of them resents the fact that I outlasted them.
786,00:51:29.04,00:51:29.04,Every single one of them. They all wanted me to go before
787,00:51:32.62,00:51:32.62,"they went. The only vote that, like, really"
788,00:51:34.92,00:51:34.92,might come my way is if Taj was so pissed at you guys she didn't
789,00:51:37.38,00:51:37.38,want to vote for you. >> Yeah.
790,00:51:44.96,00:51:44.96,>> Yeah. Mm-hmm.
791,00:51:49.71,00:51:49.71,There's been a lot of talk about how it would be suicide to go up
792,00:51:53.25,00:51:53.25,against you. >> Is that what Stephen said?
793,00:52:01.17,00:52:01.17,>> I think so. >> He ever tell you for sure?
794,00:52:08.92,00:52:08.92,>> Stephen and I made a promise to each other if we do make it
795,00:52:11.75,00:52:11.75,"to this point in the game, we take each other to the final"
796,00:52:14.88,00:52:14.88,two. But I'm finding out that
797,00:52:17.04,00:52:17.04,Stephen's already told Erinn the same thing.
798,00:52:19.08,00:52:19.08,"So, uh, why he didn't keep up his end of the deal, I'll never"
799,00:52:21.38,00:52:21.38,know. This is a game where you have to
800,00:52:24.21,00:52:24.21,be ruthless. And I know I can hands-down
801,00:52:27.04,00:52:27.04,beat Erinn. >> He's going to argue it so
802,00:52:32.21,00:52:32.21,"well, too. >> I know."
803,00:52:34.17,00:52:34.17,">> Like, the man is so much more eloquent than we are."
804,00:52:36.71,00:52:36.71,>> I know. >> Yeah.
805,00:52:44.46,00:52:44.46,>> So you'd be the more logical person to take.
806,00:52:48.25,00:52:48.25,No doubt about it. >> I think J.T. taking Stephen
807,00:52:51.83,00:52:51.83,to the final two is a very noble thing to do.
808,00:52:55.62,00:52:55.62,They have come a long way together in this game.
809,00:52:58.21,00:52:58.21,They've been together since the beginning.
810,00:53:00.50,00:53:00.50,"And to take him would be, like, very honorable."
811,00:53:03.54,00:53:03.54,"They can kind of fight it out to the end, but it might just"
812,00:53:06.38,00:53:06.38,be a draw. It's going to be a very close
813,00:53:08.92,00:53:08.92,battle. And what I know about J.T. is
814,00:53:11.67,00:53:11.67,that he's somebody that really wants and really needs this
815,00:53:14.04,00:53:14.04,money. And if J.T. wants to win a
816,00:53:16.88,00:53:16.88,"million dollars, he'll send Stephen home tonight."
817,00:53:18.83,00:53:18.83,It's the only thing that makes sense.
818,00:53:32.17,00:53:32.17,">> I mean, I didn't... >> She has a very good one."
819,00:53:43.08,00:53:43.08,>> That's not true. You know that.
820,00:53:46.25,00:53:46.25,>> I hope so. >> If you want to talk through
821,00:53:48.25,00:53:48.25,"something, I'm willing to talk through it."
822,00:53:50.25,00:53:50.25,">> What do you mean? >> No, if you're just having"
823,00:53:52.25,00:53:52.25,"doubts or something, you know? I know it's a hard decision,"
824,00:53:54.04,00:53:54.04,"though, anyway. I mean, you have to think about"
825,00:53:56.25,00:53:56.25,"it. >> I mean, it's a guaranteed"
826,00:53:57.62,00:53:57.62,million dollars for her. >> I just gotta... I always
827,00:54:04.29,00:54:04.29,"question my decisions, you know. >> I understand. That's why we"
828,00:54:07.08,00:54:07.08,work well together. We both question our decisions.
829,00:54:11.12,00:54:11.12,It would make good sense for J.T. to take Erinn with him to
830,00:54:14.67,00:54:14.67,the final two. Why take a gamble on me when he
831,00:54:17.21,00:54:17.21,"could have a lock with Erinn, you know?"
832,00:54:19.17,00:54:19.17,"When we took out Taj, when we took out Coach-- we've always"
833,00:54:22.08,00:54:22.08,kept in mind that there's a lot of money at stake here.
834,00:54:25.88,00:54:25.88,And do we want to let sentiment get in the way of that money?
835,00:54:29.29,00:54:29.29,"So, I think it's going to be a really difficult decision for"
836,00:54:32.04,00:54:32.04,J.T. tonight. But I believe that I have a good
837,00:54:35.04,00:54:35.04,"read on J.T., and on what his word means and when he means it."
838,00:54:39.04,00:54:39.04,I don't think he will betray me tonight.
839,00:54:41.67,00:54:41.67,I think the fact that you take me will do wonders.
840,00:54:44.21,00:54:44.21,"I mean, I think everyone's going to really respect that."
841,00:54:47.25,00:54:47.25,You have to know that you're going to win this.
842,00:54:49.29,00:54:49.29,I've known that since we first started our partnership.
843,00:54:53.08,00:54:53.08,I've always known that. >> I sure don't know it.
844,00:54:59.42,00:54:59.42,">> I'm a nervous man. I know that you're solid, but,"
845,00:55:01.50,00:55:01.50,"like, it's still scary. >> My mom told me when I left,"
846,00:55:10.96,00:55:10.96,"""J.T., I know you're strong and you're smart."
847,00:55:13.29,00:55:13.29,"You can win this game. If anybody can do it, you can"
848,00:55:16.08,00:55:16.08,"do it. Just don't do anything stupid."""
849,00:55:19.33,00:55:19.33,"And that keeps running through my head, and to blow that"
850,00:55:22.42,00:55:22.42,opportunity on trust to someone I've known for only 39 days-- if
851,00:55:26.54,00:55:26.54,"I was to lose because of that decision I made, I think"
852,00:55:30.21,00:55:30.21,everybody would be pretty disappointed in me.
853,00:55:46.17,00:55:46.17,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
854,00:56:01.04,00:56:01.04,"the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Debbie,"
855,00:56:10.75,00:56:10.75,"Coach. And Taj, voted out at the last"
856,00:56:13.12,00:56:13.12,"Tribal Council. Well, J.T., you have certainly"
857,00:56:24.50,00:56:24.50,"earned your way into this spot, winning the last three"
858,00:56:28.21,00:56:28.21,individual immunity challenges. Now you have probably the
859,00:56:31.12,00:56:31.12,biggest decision in this game-- who you're going to take with
860,00:56:33.79,00:56:33.79,you to the final vote tomorrow night at Tribal Council.
861,00:56:36.79,00:56:36.79,"Erinn, I'm guessing you made a case today."
862,00:56:39.25,00:56:39.25,What do you say to J.T.? What's your pitch?
863,00:56:41.92,00:56:41.92,">> We sat down and we talked about votes, plain and simple."
864,00:56:45.58,00:56:45.58,"If the two of us go, you can probably count on this vote,"
865,00:56:49.21,00:56:49.21,"this vote, this vote, this vote. I might get this one and this"
866,00:56:52.75,00:56:52.75,"one. And if you take Stephen, it"
867,00:56:55.46,00:56:55.46,could very likely be very close. He might be able to beat you.
868,00:56:58.54,00:56:58.54,">> PROBST: So you pitched a case that ""you can beat me."
869,00:57:00.88,00:57:00.88,"I want to make it to the end and you'll win against me."""
870,00:57:03.83,00:57:03.83,">> I will not go down without kicking and screaming about it,"
871,00:57:06.08,00:57:06.08,but he could very well win against me.
872,00:57:09.50,00:57:09.50,Probably has a better shot than against Stephen.
873,00:57:11.83,00:57:11.83,">> PROBST: Stephen, you get some time with J.T."
874,00:57:14.17,00:57:14.17,"What's your pitch? >> Well, you know, J.T. and I"
875,00:57:16.38,00:57:16.38,have been partners in crime since day two of this game.
876,00:57:19.21,00:57:19.21,We have basically shared a brain and made every move of this game
877,00:57:24.17,00:57:24.17,"together, and, you know, I think my pitch was more based on sort"
878,00:57:28.08,00:57:28.08,"of our long-term commitments to each other, what that would mean"
879,00:57:31.17,00:57:31.17,"in the future for our enduring friendship and relationship, and"
880,00:57:34.58,00:57:34.58,just the promises we had made to each other.
881,00:57:37.12,00:57:37.12,">> PROBST: So, J.T., two very different choices: loyalty with"
882,00:57:41.92,00:57:41.92,"Stephen, been together since day one; easy money against Erinn--"
883,00:57:46.17,00:57:46.17,"""That's why I came here, to win."""
884,00:57:48.21,00:57:48.21,So how does this work itself out in your head?
885,00:57:50.54,00:57:50.54,">> There's two different approaches, and I've just got to"
886,00:57:54.04,00:57:54.04,figure out which one is more important to me.
887,00:57:56.92,00:57:56.92,I do feel like I could beat Erinn really easily compared to
888,00:58:00.29,00:58:00.29,the match-up I would have against Stephen in the jury
889,00:58:02.04,00:58:02.04,votes. No doubt about it.
890,00:58:04.00,00:58:04.00,So both of 'em make good cases. Which one is more important to
891,00:58:07.62,00:58:07.62,"me-- come here and win the easy million dollars or, you know,"
892,00:58:11.21,00:58:11.21,stay with what's gotten me this far?
893,00:58:13.25,00:58:13.25,>> PROBST: So the case to be made for bringing Stephen is
894,00:58:16.17,00:58:16.17,what? >> I think if I was to bring the
895,00:58:19.21,00:58:19.21,"best to the end, out of us three I would be bringing Stephen to"
896,00:58:22.25,00:58:22.25,"the end, and I think if I took Stephen, I would be sticking to"
897,00:58:25.29,00:58:25.29,my word. >> PROBST: So in a game that
898,00:58:27.58,00:58:27.58,"really is about outwitting everybody, why make the moral"
899,00:58:30.54,00:58:30.54,choice to go with somebody you promised you'd bring to the end?
900,00:58:33.50,00:58:33.50,>> I've got to think about: would Stephen have done the same
901,00:58:35.79,00:58:35.79,thing had he won? >> PROBST: What's your gut tell
902,00:58:37.83,00:58:37.83,"you? >> I don't know, I'll never"
903,00:58:40.71,00:58:40.71,"know, but I'd be sticking my neck out a lot if I took Stephen"
904,00:58:43.92,00:58:43.92,to the end because-- Stephen is an excellent guy.
905,00:58:46.38,00:58:46.38,"Just like I did, he made good relationships in this game."
906,00:58:49.17,00:58:49.17,"You know, I do feel like taking Stephen is a huge risk."
907,00:58:52.54,00:58:52.54,>> Can... Can I interject? >> PROBST: Yeah.
908,00:58:54.38,00:58:54.38,>> There's also a lot of added reasons why we should go to the
909,00:58:57.04,00:58:57.04,"end together, not least is this breakfast that we've talked"
910,00:59:00.12,00:59:00.12,"about having on day 39 since day two, you know..."
911,00:59:02.75,00:59:02.75,">> PROBST: And you know, I got to admit, when you weigh a"
912,00:59:04.62,00:59:04.62,million dollars versus a breakfast with your 39-day
913,00:59:07.08,00:59:07.08,"friend, you're right, that's a tough one."
914,00:59:10.04,00:59:10.04,>> My point is that there's more to a relationship than a million
915,00:59:13.33,00:59:13.33,"dollars. >> PROBST: Let me ask you this,"
916,00:59:15.62,00:59:15.62,Stephen. He doesn't pick you.
917,00:59:18.21,00:59:18.21,He takes Erinn and he wins. You're not friends after this?
918,00:59:20.58,00:59:20.58,">> I mean, I think we would be friends."
919,00:59:23.00,00:59:23.00,I don't think it would be the same kind of friendship.
920,00:59:25.08,00:59:25.08,"The swears that he has made to me, like, defy all swears that"
921,00:59:28.00,00:59:28.00,"I've ever made. And look, I have made promises"
922,00:59:30.08,00:59:30.08,that I've broken in this game. There's no question about that.
923,00:59:32.25,00:59:32.25,"I have absolutely lied, deceived people, and made promises that I"
924,00:59:35.38,00:59:35.38,"have broken, you know. I might be number one blindsider"
925,00:59:39.00,00:59:39.00,"or Jed is number one blindsider. I don't know, but-- I mean, up"
926,00:59:42.67,00:59:42.67,"and down, to God, to himself, to his life, so I mean, you know,"
927,00:59:45.83,00:59:45.83,"I'm hoping. >> PROBST: Erinn, you might be"
928,00:59:47.88,00:59:47.88,best off saying nothing at all. Stephen might be making a better
929,00:59:50.04,00:59:50.04,case for you than you could make for yourself.
930,00:59:51.71,00:59:51.71,>> (laughing): Damn. >> Sure.
931,00:59:53.62,00:59:53.62,">> I'll shut my mouth, all right."
932,00:59:55.33,00:59:55.33,">> PROBST: I'm just observing. >> No, I mean, look, I'm"
933,00:59:57.17,00:59:57.17,obviously very nervous tonight. I think we all are except for
934,00:59:59.12,00:59:59.12,J.T. >> I'm pretty damn nervous
935,01:00:00.83,01:00:00.83,myself. >> (laughing): I think he's more
936,01:00:02.62,01:00:02.62,"nervous than we are. >> PROBST: So, J.T., now make"
937,01:00:06.79,01:00:06.79,"the case for bringing Erinn and saying, ""Sorry, Stephen, loyalty"
938,01:00:10.75,01:00:10.75,"went only 38 days. It doesn't go the whole way."""
939,01:00:13.88,01:00:13.88,">> You know, I'm not 100%, but I feel like I'd have a much better"
940,01:00:17.04,01:00:17.04,opportunity beating Erinn in jury votes because I do know
941,01:00:20.04,01:00:20.04,"that her tribemates were trying to get rid of her on, like, day"
942,01:00:23.08,01:00:23.08,nine. That alone tells me that they
943,01:00:25.50,01:00:25.50,would not really want to give her a million dollars compared
944,01:00:28.04,01:00:28.04,"to me, so, you know, there's, there's a huge, huge reason why"
945,01:00:31.83,01:00:31.83,I should take Erinn to the final two.
946,01:00:34.42,01:00:34.42,>> PROBST: Let's get to the vote.
947,01:00:37.50,01:00:37.50,"Here's how it's going to work: Erinn and Stephen, you cannot"
948,01:00:40.08,01:00:40.08,vote for J.T. You cannot vote for yourself.
949,01:00:42.46,01:00:42.46,"Therefore, you will not vote. Which means, J.T., you're the"
950,01:00:45.29,01:00:45.29,"only one voting. If you choose right, this time"
951,01:00:48.17,01:00:48.17,"tomorrow night, you're a millionaire."
952,01:00:50.17,01:00:50.17,"It's time to vote. Make your vote, J.T."
953,01:01:22.71,01:01:22.71,"I'll go get the vote. Once the votes are read, the"
954,01:01:38.79,01:01:38.79,decision is final. The person voted out will be
955,01:01:41.00,01:01:41.00,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
956,01:01:42.83,01:01:42.83,"I'll read the vote. 14th person voted out, and the"
957,01:01:50.58,01:01:50.58,seventh and final member of our jury...
958,01:01:57.25,01:01:57.25,Erinn. Bring me your torch.
959,01:02:09.67,01:02:09.67,"Erinn, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
960,01:02:27.21,01:02:27.21,"Well, J.T. and Stephen, you've gone as far as you can go in"
961,01:02:31.17,01:02:31.17,this game. The power now shifts to the
962,01:02:33.42,01:02:33.42,"jury. Tomorrow night, they will"
963,01:02:35.75,01:02:35.75,decide which of the two of you they feel most deserving of the
964,01:02:38.92,01:02:38.92,title of sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes
965,01:02:42.17,01:02:42.17,along with it. You have one more night in
966,01:02:45.17,01:02:45.17,Brazil. Enjoy it.
967,01:02:46.71,01:02:46.71,I'll see you tomorrow night for your final Tribal Council.
968,01:02:48.75,01:02:48.75,"Good night. >> I was a little bit surprised,"
969,01:03:03.17,01:03:03.17,"but I think, like, deep down, I definitely knew that that was"
970,01:03:06.88,01:03:06.88,"the decision that J.T. was going to make, and I'm really proud of"
971,01:03:10.21,01:03:10.21,"myself for as far as I've come. It's really been life-changing,"
972,01:03:13.54,01:03:13.54,and I'm glad I was able to stick around as long as I did.
973,01:03:46.75,01:03:46.75,>> I feel really great. It's day 39.
974,01:03:49.29,01:03:49.29,"Uh, the sun's coming up. It's a beautiful morning, and,"
975,01:03:52.83,01:03:52.83,"uh, I'm still here. Stephen's here with me, just"
976,01:03:56.29,01:03:56.29,like we planned a long time ago. And it's kind of hard to
977,01:04:00.08,01:04:00.08,"believe, you know. >> So, you and I are going to be"
978,01:04:05.00,01:04:05.00,"friends for life. >> I know, man."
979,01:04:08.54,01:04:08.54,>> It's hugely satisfying to be here with J.T. at the end.
980,01:04:12.00,01:04:12.00,"Since the beginning of the game, we've been talking about final"
981,01:04:14.67,01:04:14.67,"two, and here we are, final freaking two, day 39, and"
982,01:04:19.04,01:04:19.04,"regardless of what happens, regardless of who ultimately"
983,01:04:21.88,01:04:21.88,"wins, that's something that, you know, can't be taken away"
984,01:04:25.04,01:04:25.04,"from us. Damn, we talked about this on,"
985,01:04:28.21,01:04:28.21,"like, day three-- we said final two."
986,01:04:30.96,01:04:30.96,>> We dominated the entire game. Physically and socially.
987,01:04:36.17,01:04:36.17,">> Tree mail. Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God!"
988,01:04:40.75,01:04:40.75,">> Dude, there are eggs here! >> And a bottle of bubbly."
989,01:04:44.25,01:04:44.25,>> We are going to have a huge freaking breakfast.
990,01:04:57.29,01:04:57.29,The warrior and the wizard. Day 39.
991,01:05:00.58,01:05:00.58,">> This is awesome. >> I mean, it was like a"
992,01:05:04.04,01:05:04.04,"cornucopia-- eggs, sausages, bread."
993,01:05:08.00,01:05:08.00,>> I usually don't eat very much.
994,01:05:10.04,01:05:10.04,">> Me, neither. >> But this is incredible."
995,01:05:12.17,01:05:12.17,">> So, we spent the next couple of hours doing it right."
996,01:05:14.54,01:05:14.54,We cooked everything straight through.
997,01:05:17.08,01:05:17.08,>> Whoo! >> Cooked to perfection.
998,01:05:21.62,01:05:21.62,>> This is the best meal. I'm not worrying about strategy.
999,01:05:25.12,01:05:25.12,>> Mm-hmm. J.T. and I have been talking
1000,01:05:27.33,01:05:27.33,about day 39 together as this symbol of our achievement
1001,01:05:30.54,01:05:30.54,together. This was our reward for
1002,01:05:32.71,01:05:32.71,"overcoming all of the obstacles in our way, and we got to share"
1003,01:05:36.08,01:05:36.08,"it-- just us, successful. >> Won't shake it up, 'cause I"
1004,01:05:39.62,01:05:39.62,don't want to waste any. Oh!
1005,01:05:41.83,01:05:41.83,>> Whoo! This stuff goes right to your
1006,01:05:44.29,01:05:44.29,head. (J.T. chuckling)
1007,01:05:46.08,01:05:46.08,"Well, this definitely deserves a toast."
1008,01:05:47.88,01:05:47.88,">> Yup. >> Day 39, final two."
1009,01:05:50.17,01:05:50.17,>> Final two. >> Mmm.
1010,01:05:55.96,01:05:55.96,Tastes like victory. >> It's not too bad.
1011,01:05:59.79,01:05:59.79,(sighs) >> This is the perfect ending.
1012,01:06:02.54,01:06:02.54,First impressions-- what was your first impression of me?
1013,01:06:05.54,01:06:05.54,">> You looked like you were strong, but you looked very"
1014,01:06:08.25,01:06:08.25,"unathletic, and I thought you were really religious."
1015,01:06:11.17,01:06:11.17,I'm going to have to watch my mouth around you.
1016,01:06:13.46,01:06:13.46,I think I'm changed for the better.
1017,01:06:15.62,01:06:15.62,"Uh, you know, don't judge a book by its cover, obviously, and,"
1018,01:06:18.29,01:06:18.29,"uh, don't go off first impressions."
1019,01:06:20.71,01:06:20.71,"Outside of the country guy and the city guy, you know, when it"
1020,01:06:23.54,01:06:23.54,"comes down to it, we're a lot alike."
1021,01:06:26.04,01:06:26.04,">> I thought you were, like, just like a charmer."
1022,01:06:28.21,01:06:28.21,"I just thought you were like a... a gregarious, kind of"
1023,01:06:32.00,01:06:32.00,"charming, slick guy. My first impression of J.T. was,"
1024,01:06:35.75,01:06:35.75,"you know, we're not going to get along, but I was totally wrong"
1025,01:06:38.58,01:06:38.58,about J.T. He might be the good old boy
1026,01:06:41.12,01:06:41.12,"from the South, but he's ended up being the person whose mind"
1027,01:06:43.54,01:06:43.54,"has worked most like my own. And that, to me, is really"
1028,01:06:46.17,01:06:46.17,"surprising, that in spite of our completely different"
1029,01:06:48.21,01:06:48.21,"backgrounds, our minds seemed to work totally in sync."
1030,01:06:53.54,01:06:53.54,"(squawking) >> Ready, boy."
1031,01:07:04.71,01:07:04.71,>> Let's do it. >> Stephen and myself-- we are
1032,01:07:10.71,01:07:10.71,the last two standing. Going into the Tribal Council
1033,01:07:12.75,01:07:12.75,"tonight, there's no doubt about it."
1034,01:07:14.79,01:07:14.79,"I'm going to have to lay all of our friendship stuff aside,"
1035,01:07:17.79,01:07:17.79,"because whatever it takes to win a million dollars, now I got to"
1036,01:07:20.71,01:07:20.71,"do it. You know, I brought along"
1037,01:07:22.71,01:07:22.71,"competition. That's what I wanted, and I got"
1038,01:07:25.08,01:07:25.08,"it, but, man... I've never had any doubts in"
1039,01:07:27.42,01:07:27.42,Tribal Council until tonight. >> When I go into Tribal
1040,01:07:33.46,01:07:33.46,"Council tonight, I have a story to tell, and I'm going to tell"
1041,01:07:36.08,01:07:36.08,it. I'm going to argue my case.
1042,01:07:38.42,01:07:38.42,"I'm not going to go in defeated. I'm not going to be, like,"
1043,01:07:41.21,01:07:41.21,"""J.T.'s awesome. Let's all give him a round of"
1044,01:07:43.50,01:07:43.50,"applause and a million bucks."" I'm going to fight for it."
1045,01:07:45.83,01:07:45.83,"I don't know which way the jury will vote, but I am not going to"
1046,01:07:49.00,01:07:49.00,go away without a fight. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
1047,01:08:19.42,01:08:19.42,"the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Deb,"
1048,01:08:27.04,01:08:27.04,"Coach, Taj and Erinn, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
1049,01:08:36.71,01:08:36.71,"Stephen, J.T., congratulations. After 39 days, you have gone as"
1050,01:08:41.17,01:08:41.17,far as you can go in this game. The power now shifts to the
1051,01:08:45.08,01:08:45.08,jury. They hold your fate in their
1052,01:08:47.33,01:08:47.33,hands. Tonight the jury will decide
1053,01:08:49.17,01:08:49.17,which of the two of you they think is most worthy of the
1054,01:08:52.00,01:08:52.00,title of sole survivor and the million dollars that goes along
1055,01:08:54.42,01:08:54.42,with it. Here's how it's going to work.
1056,01:08:56.83,01:08:56.83,"You will each get a chance to make an opening statement, plead"
1057,01:08:59.46,01:08:59.46,your case-- why you deserve to win.
1058,01:09:02.12,01:09:02.12,"The jury will then get their first chance to address you, and"
1059,01:09:05.00,01:09:05.00,then we will vote. Let's get started.
1060,01:09:07.88,01:09:07.88,"Stephen, you're up. Opening statement."
1061,01:09:09.96,01:09:09.96,">> Um, I mean, it's obviously hard to talk, you know, against"
1062,01:09:12.08,01:09:12.08,"J.T. now and to sort of compare myself to him, since we have"
1063,01:09:15.21,01:09:15.21,"been through so much together, but, you know, if you are making"
1064,01:09:17.83,01:09:17.83,this decision based on who is the better woodsman or who had
1065,01:09:20.46,01:09:20.46,"the best and most charming Southern drawl, you know, you"
1066,01:09:23.04,01:09:23.04,could have made this decision on day one and spared everyone a
1067,01:09:25.62,01:09:25.62,lot of struggle and a lot of hunger.
1068,01:09:27.92,01:09:27.92,"And, you know, we since the very early days just sort of shared a"
1069,01:09:31.21,01:09:31.21,"brain when it came to strategy. You know, we'd talk through"
1070,01:09:34.58,01:09:34.58,"everything, decide everything together, and I think that's why"
1071,01:09:37.25,01:09:37.25,"we did so well, because we were able to work together, but I"
1072,01:09:40.08,01:09:40.08,kind of want to focus maybe on not what we brought into the
1073,01:09:43.00,01:09:43.00,game but what we've taken out of the game.
1074,01:09:45.29,01:09:45.29,"And, you know, I came into the game extremely uncomfortable in"
1075,01:09:47.83,01:09:47.83,"my own skin. You know, I had never been"
1076,01:09:50.21,01:09:50.21,"camping before, so I think my road has been a lot harder, and"
1077,01:09:54.21,01:09:54.21,"that transformation has made me more comfortable, more"
1078,01:09:58.62,01:09:58.62,"self-reliant, and I think a better person, and I owe a lot"
1079,01:10:01.42,01:10:01.42,"of that, also, to just all of you."
1080,01:10:04.17,01:10:04.17,"And, uh, you know, as a testament to the struggles that"
1081,01:10:07.62,01:10:07.62,"we've all sort of faced to get here, and the journey we've all"
1082,01:10:10.17,01:10:10.17,"had together, I hope you vote for me tonight."
1083,01:10:15.38,01:10:15.38,>> PROBST: J.T.? >> It's going to be hard to
1084,01:10:18.46,01:10:18.46,"follow up on that. I'm obviously not a, you know,"
1085,01:10:20.75,01:10:20.75,"graduate or English major, anything like my buddy Stephen"
1086,01:10:22.96,01:10:22.96,here. I'm actually the first person in
1087,01:10:25.04,01:10:25.04,"my family to ever graduate college, but don't think I want"
1088,01:10:28.08,01:10:28.08,a pity vote. Because I worked very hard to
1089,01:10:30.71,01:10:30.71,get where I'm at. I did everything I possibly
1090,01:10:33.08,01:10:33.08,could to provide for everybody at every chance I got.
1091,01:10:35.71,01:10:35.71,And most of the times that guy that puts things like that on
1092,01:10:38.38,01:10:38.38,"the line-- they're voted out right off the bat, you know."
1093,01:10:40.71,01:10:40.71,"And to do that and accept it and never get a vote in this game,"
1094,01:10:44.25,01:10:44.25,"not once, you know, is a huge accomplishment for me."
1095,01:10:47.04,01:10:47.04,And to make friends with you guys.
1096,01:10:49.08,01:10:49.08,"I mean, it was very hard to vote you guys out."
1097,01:10:51.67,01:10:51.67,The way we picked who we voted off was the people that we
1098,01:10:54.25,01:10:54.25,thought were going to vote us off.
1099,01:10:56.54,01:10:56.54,And had we not gotten rid of you you'd be sitting where I'm at
1100,01:10:59.21,01:10:59.21,today and I'd be over there. There's no doubt about it.
1101,01:11:01.50,01:11:01.50,"But I do stick to my word, you know."
1102,01:11:04.08,01:11:04.08,I had a really easy opportunity to bring Erinn who I felt like--
1103,01:11:06.79,01:11:06.79,"Erinn, you know, no offense-- was I felt like I could beat up"
1104,01:11:09.71,01:11:09.71,"here a lot easier, you know. Everyone loves Stephen."
1105,01:11:12.71,01:11:12.71,"I do, too. So I feel like he deserved to be"
1106,01:11:15.50,01:11:15.50,"here beside me. Do I feel like he's outwitted,"
1107,01:11:18.04,01:11:18.04,"outplayed, and outlasted me? I don't think so."
1108,01:11:21.08,01:11:21.08,But that's in your guys' hands now.
1109,01:11:23.83,01:11:23.83,"That's about all. >> PROBST: Thanks, Stephen."
1110,01:11:26.25,01:11:26.25,"Thanks, J.T. All right, jury, in a moment"
1111,01:11:28.50,01:11:28.50,you're going to get your first chance to address Stephen and
1112,01:11:31.21,01:11:31.21,J.T. Give you a minute to think about
1113,01:11:33.50,01:11:33.50,"what you want to say.  >> PROBST: All right, jury,"
1114,01:11:47.25,01:11:47.25,"it's now your first chance to address Stephen and J.T., hoping"
1115,01:11:50.75,01:11:50.75,to gather a little information to help you make a very big
1116,01:11:54.08,01:11:54.08,"decision-- who deserves to win this game, who deserves the"
1117,01:11:57.67,01:11:57.67,"million dollars. Brendan, let's get started."
1118,01:12:01.17,01:12:01.17,You're up first. >> Congratulations to you guys
1119,01:12:03.75,01:12:03.75,both. It's been fun watching you both
1120,01:12:05.75,01:12:05.75,play the game. My first question is for
1121,01:12:07.29,01:12:07.29,Stephen. You spent so much of your first
1122,01:12:09.04,01:12:09.04,argument talking about your growth within the game.
1123,01:12:12.17,01:12:12.17,"For me I look at, you know, all the different sporting events"
1124,01:12:15.00,01:12:15.00,"and all the different games that we've all seen, and in not one"
1125,01:12:18.21,01:12:18.21,game is who works hardest or who grows the most the reason that
1126,01:12:22.67,01:12:22.67,you win the game. Can you think of anything?
1127,01:12:25.42,01:12:25.42,">> I mean, the game of Survivor actually might be one of them."
1128,01:12:28.04,01:12:28.04,"I mean, there's that outwit, out-outplay, outlast."
1129,01:12:30.04,01:12:30.04,So there is that outwit component.
1130,01:12:32.08,01:12:32.08,I obviously had to focus more on that than outplay.
1131,01:12:34.38,01:12:34.38,">> So should you be handicapped? >> No, no, but I'm saying for me"
1132,01:12:37.00,01:12:37.00,to last this long has been a real struggle.
1133,01:12:39.29,01:12:39.29,"You know, J.T.'s an amazing outdoorsman."
1134,01:12:41.67,01:12:41.67,"I came in with none of these skills, I still persevered and"
1135,01:12:44.79,01:12:44.79,will be leaving the game with many of them.
1136,01:12:47.08,01:12:47.08,">> J.T., you know, when you think about this idea of growth,"
1137,01:12:49.46,01:12:49.46,in terms of deciding who should actually come home with
1138,01:12:52.21,01:12:52.21,"a million dollars, do you think it's relevant?"
1139,01:12:54.83,01:12:54.83,">> Growth is irrelevant, really. I mean, that's something you can"
1140,01:12:58.04,01:12:58.04,carry home with you. That's something that's good for
1141,01:13:00.12,01:13:00.12,"you personally, but, obviously, you know, if you go to a"
1142,01:13:03.21,01:13:03.21,football game and just because it was harder for you to catch
1143,01:13:05.50,01:13:05.50,"the ball and you catch it, doesn't make it better than the"
1144,01:13:08.12,01:13:08.12,person that already knew how to catch it.
1145,01:13:10.17,01:13:10.17,"So, I do feel like I outplayed Stephen and, you know, Stephen"
1146,01:13:12.46,01:13:12.46,hid in the shadows in some of the challenges.
1147,01:13:15.00,01:13:15.00,"I had to tell him, ""Dude, you can do it."""
1148,01:13:17.00,01:13:17.00,"Have confidence in yourself. >> I mean, can I-- can I have a"
1149,01:13:19.08,01:13:19.08,"rebuttal to what he just said? >> Sure, I love it. Let's go."
1150,01:13:21.88,01:13:21.88,">> Okay, um, hiding in the shadows is a legitimate"
1151,01:13:24.25,01:13:24.25,strategy. I think we all know that.
1152,01:13:26.58,01:13:26.58,>> I would think a guy that puts his neck out on the line would--
1153,01:13:29.04,01:13:29.04,should earn a little more respect than someone that kind
1154,01:13:31.08,01:13:31.08,of floats under the radar. >> Okay.
1155,01:13:34.12,01:13:34.12,Cool. Thank you.
1156,01:13:38.67,01:13:38.67,>> PROBST: Erinn. You're up.
1157,01:13:42.67,01:13:42.67,">> Stephen, I have seen you play three very specific alliances--"
1158,01:13:47.04,01:13:47.04,"the Jalapao three, the Exile alliance, the Warrior alliance."
1159,01:13:54.04,01:13:54.04,But almost everyone in every one of those alliances is on
1160,01:13:59.71,01:13:59.71,the jury. So should I just vote for J.T.?
1161,01:14:02.96,01:14:02.96,">> Look, you know, obviously this game involves a lot of, you"
1162,01:14:06.75,01:14:06.75,"know, creating a lot of dynamic structures and then working"
1163,01:14:10.04,01:14:10.04,within those structures to advance yourself as best as you
1164,01:14:12.12,01:14:12.12,can. In terms of moving within those
1165,01:14:14.25,01:14:14.25,"alliances, zigging when you have to zig, zagging when you have to"
1166,01:14:16.50,01:14:16.50,zag to get yourself further... I think I did that really well.
1167,01:14:19.67,01:14:19.67,"If you respect that aggressive style of play, I hope you vote"
1168,01:14:22.21,01:14:22.21,"for me. And I-- if you don't, I"
1169,01:14:24.29,01:14:24.29,understand if you don't. >> Okay.
1170,01:14:27.25,01:14:27.25,"J.T., there's been a lot of talk about taking the strength to the"
1171,01:14:32.42,01:14:32.42,end. Can you be really honest and
1172,01:14:35.29,01:14:35.29,tell me why Stephen is the best? >> I felt like Stephen was the
1173,01:14:41.17,01:14:41.17,best because at the time he was the most honest person with me.
1174,01:14:46.12,01:14:46.12,"No matter what we done, he was always there, and I feel like in"
1175,01:14:49.17,01:14:49.17,"Jalapao he was definitely the best, and when we moved over,"
1176,01:14:52.08,01:14:52.08,"Coach said, ""Who is the next strongest person?"""
1177,01:14:54.12,01:14:54.12,"I said out of everybody in Jalapao, Stephen is the best."
1178,01:14:56.67,01:14:56.67,"You know, I could have left him out there, but I brought him"
1179,01:14:59.21,01:14:59.21,along in the power alliance. And out of the power alliance
1180,01:15:02.12,01:15:02.12,"that I thought was the best, it would be me and Stephen, no"
1181,01:15:05.46,01:15:05.46,doubt about it. >> PROBST: Thanks.
1182,01:15:09.67,01:15:09.67,"Deb, you're up. >> Hi, guys."
1183,01:15:14.17,01:15:14.17,I want to start by telling you that I haven't decided...
1184,01:15:17.50,01:15:17.50,as to who is going to have my vote for a million dollars.
1185,01:15:21.08,01:15:21.08,"J.T., one of the things that is most important to me is honesty."
1186,01:15:26.46,01:15:26.46,"I immediately was drawn to you. I was like this is a great guy,"
1187,01:15:30.71,01:15:30.71,"great, pure heart. As the game progressed, all of a"
1188,01:15:34.50,01:15:34.50,"sudden, I thought, man, I misjudged this guy."
1189,01:15:36.54,01:15:36.54,So was my first instinct right? Or is lying and deception your
1190,01:15:42.29,01:15:42.29,"MO, and you just let me think that you're somebody else in the"
1191,01:15:45.58,01:15:45.58,"beginning? >> Debbie, I'll be honest with"
1192,01:15:47.79,01:15:47.79,you-- when I come into this game my mother told me do not believe
1193,01:15:51.79,01:15:51.79,what everybody tells you. You're going to have to lie to
1194,01:15:54.71,01:15:54.71,win this game. A million dollars on the line.
1195,01:15:57.75,01:15:57.75,"I mean, you'd have done the same thing I did at the end of the"
1196,01:16:00.96,01:16:00.96,"game. You know, you didn't go tell"
1197,01:16:02.67,01:16:02.67,"Coach, that, ""Hey, I'm fixing to vote you out,"" you know."
1198,01:16:04.92,01:16:04.92,I had to do that in order to get here.
1199,01:16:07.75,01:16:07.75,">> Okay, I appreciate that. I appreciate that."
1200,01:16:10.33,01:16:10.33,"Stephen, my question is, if yesterday you had the immunity"
1201,01:16:15.54,01:16:15.54,"necklace on that J.T. had, would J.T. be the one sitting next to"
1202,01:16:19.33,01:16:19.33,you right now? I want an honest answer to this
1203,01:16:22.17,01:16:22.17,"question. >> All right, I'll tell you"
1204,01:16:25.21,01:16:25.21,"honestly, and I want to speak honestly in answer to every"
1205,01:16:28.12,01:16:28.12,question tonight. I-- I don't know.
1206,01:16:30.08,01:16:30.08,And I never made that decision...
1207,01:16:32.08,01:16:32.08,">> No, that-that's not good. No, stop."
1208,01:16:34.50,01:16:34.50,"I like you, Stephen. >> Okay."
1209,01:16:36.50,01:16:36.50,">> I do, but-but I don't want ""I don't know."""
1210,01:16:39.08,01:16:39.08,"I've got to decide if I'm voting for you, for a million dollars."
1211,01:16:42.29,01:16:42.29,"You do know who would be sitting next to you, and I, quite"
1212,01:16:45.12,01:16:45.12,"frankly, feel like I might, too. I need a clear answer from you,"
1213,01:16:49.29,01:16:49.29,Stephen. And I need you to be honest.
1214,01:16:51.92,01:16:51.92,That's what I'm basing my vote on is honesty.
1215,01:16:56.12,01:16:56.12,>> I think it would be Erinn. I-I hope I would have taken
1216,01:17:01.42,01:17:01.42,J.T. My fear is that I would've
1217,01:17:03.67,01:17:03.67,chosen Erinn if it had come down to it.
1218,01:17:06.25,01:17:06.25,">> Thank you. Okay, I appreciate that."
1219,01:17:09.25,01:17:09.25,Good luck to both of you. I'll listen the rest of the
1220,01:17:12.42,01:17:12.42,"evening, and my vote's still out there."
1221,01:17:15.46,01:17:15.46,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks. Thanks, Deb."
1222,01:17:19.25,01:17:19.25,"Coach, you're up. >> Last two remnants of the"
1223,01:17:23.88,01:17:23.88,power alliance. Makes me a little bit proud to
1224,01:17:27.17,01:17:27.17,see the warrior and the wizard up here.
1225,01:17:30.08,01:17:30.08,"A lot of unanswered questions. You know, I had a lot of"
1226,01:17:32.21,01:17:32.21,philosophies coming into this game.
1227,01:17:34.12,01:17:34.12,"One of them was ""as iron sharpens iron, so one man"
1228,01:17:36.71,01:17:36.71,"sharpens another."" So, keep that in mind"
1229,01:17:39.50,01:17:39.50,"and we'll start with you, J.T. Honesty and integrity."
1230,01:17:43.25,01:17:43.25,"Early on, it's easy to keep that."
1231,01:17:45.71,01:17:45.71,"Late in the game, when it counts is what I want to hear"
1232,01:17:48.04,01:17:48.04,examples and then the second part of that is being the noble
1233,01:17:51.25,01:17:51.25,"warrior, putting others in front of yourself while being"
1234,01:17:54.29,01:17:54.29,"ferocious on the battlefield. So, give me examples of honesty"
1235,01:17:57.83,01:17:57.83,late in the game when it counts and also being that noble
1236,01:18:01.29,01:18:01.29,"warrior. >> Coach, there was times"
1237,01:18:04.04,01:18:04.04,towards the end of the game where I couldn't tell you
1238,01:18:05.83,01:18:05.83,"everything that was going on, but when I made a promise to"
1239,01:18:08.62,01:18:08.62,"you, like the one I made after the last challenge we had, I"
1240,01:18:11.88,01:18:11.88,"said, ""I promise you, I'm voting for Erinn."""
1241,01:18:13.25,01:18:13.25,"I knew you were going home that night, but there was no way"
1242,01:18:16.08,01:18:16.08,"I was gonna vote for you, Coach, because you and I and Stephen "
1243,01:18:19.17,01:18:19.17,could've been sitting here. I'd have felt comfortable taking
1244,01:18:21.50,01:18:21.50,you because I knew you'd have taken me to the final two.
1245,01:18:24.04,01:18:24.04,"Uh, you know, I thought Stephen would, um, but, you know, I just"
1246,01:18:28.08,01:18:28.08,found out otherwise.  I said I would take the
1247,01:18:30.50,01:18:30.50,strongest that was left to the end and I could have took the
1248,01:18:33.58,01:18:33.58,easy million dollars with Erinn. I risked a million dollars in
1249,01:18:37.71,01:18:37.71,"order to keep my word to you and keep my word to Stephen,"
1250,01:18:40.58,01:18:40.58,bringing the strongest that was left to the end.
1251,01:18:42.42,01:18:42.42,"I may be that dumb fool that mixes morals with millions, you"
1252,01:18:46.25,01:18:46.25,"know? And as far as being a warrior,"
1253,01:18:48.96,01:18:48.96,"I battled everything I done 100%, no matter what, and I"
1254,01:18:52.17,01:18:52.17,"never give up on anything I do. >> Okay, I'm going to move to"
1255,01:18:55.67,01:18:55.67,Stephen. Same question-- honor and
1256,01:18:57.71,01:18:57.71,"integrity, and being a warrior. >> All right, I think that, I"
1257,01:19:01.50,01:19:01.50,"mean, in terms of honor and integrity, this may sound"
1258,01:19:04.25,01:19:04.25,"perverse, but I voted for every single one of you."
1259,01:19:08.21,01:19:08.21,I never took the weasel way out. And J.T. knew you were getting
1260,01:19:11.04,01:19:11.04,"a limit... Well, I don't want to..."
1261,01:19:12.88,01:19:12.88,"I mean, I'm not gonna make that comparison. I'm sorry."
1262,01:19:15.17,01:19:15.17,>> I told 'em that. >> I want to say that I did vote
1263,01:19:17.25,01:19:17.25,"for every one of you, because I felt like if I was going to try"
1264,01:19:19.83,01:19:19.83,"to take you out, I was going to bear the moral burden of that."
1265,01:19:22.25,01:19:22.25,"Um, so whenever there was a vote, I absolutely wanted to"
1266,01:19:24.67,01:19:24.67,write the person's name down. In terms of being a noble
1267,01:19:28.00,01:19:28.00,"warrior, I have yet to say anything negative about J.T."
1268,01:19:30.42,01:19:30.42,"tonight, and I think that... I think that's a strong"
1269,01:19:32.54,01:19:32.54,statement. >> Okay.
1270,01:19:36.67,01:19:36.67,">> PROBST: Thanks, Coach. Sierra."
1271,01:19:40.04,01:19:40.04,You're up. >> Congratulations to both of
1272,01:19:44.62,01:19:44.62,you. I had a question for Stephen
1273,01:19:47.58,01:19:47.58,"tonight, and he pretty much already addressed all of it, so"
1274,01:19:50.33,01:19:50.33,I don't have any further questions for you.
1275,01:19:52.38,01:19:52.38,I've heard enough. I still think you're a
1276,01:19:54.42,01:19:54.42,"sweetheart, Stephen. And for J.T., my question for"
1277,01:19:57.04,01:19:57.04,"you is, what does taking the strongest really mean to you?"
1278,01:20:01.75,01:20:01.75,Because you're standing with one of the weakest players I've ever
1279,01:20:05.04,01:20:05.04,seen. And when you had the choice to
1280,01:20:07.50,01:20:07.50,"take Taj with you, you took another weak player, Erinn."
1281,01:20:12.46,01:20:12.46,"So actually, you took the two weakest players with you."
1282,01:20:15.21,01:20:15.21,How do you admire that and want to sit next to that?
1283,01:20:18.17,01:20:18.17,">> Actually, I really feel like Stephen is a strong competitor."
1284,01:20:21.25,01:20:21.25,He won the individual immunity necklace and almost beat me in
1285,01:20:23.67,01:20:23.67,the final immunity challenge. And of the stronger players that
1286,01:20:27.12,01:20:27.12,"was left in the final four, I believe that Stephen was the"
1287,01:20:30.58,01:20:30.58,strongest left. >> You choosing Stephen was the
1288,01:20:33.21,01:20:33.21,"right thing, but you lost a lot of my respect, because you could"
1289,01:20:37.67,01:20:37.67,have been sitting here tonight with Tyson.
1290,01:20:40.04,01:20:40.04,You could have been sitting here tonight with Brendan or Debbie.
1291,01:20:43.21,01:20:43.21,"And that vote, if you would have won, you would have been a"
1292,01:20:46.29,01:20:46.29,"stronger man, because you were sitting next to a strong"
1293,01:20:48.54,01:20:48.54,competitor. That just may be your downfall
1294,01:20:50.58,01:20:50.58,and the reason why you might not get a million dollars tonight.
1295,01:20:53.79,01:20:53.79,">> PROBST: Thanks, Sierra. Tyson."
1296,01:21:00.62,01:21:00.62,">> Dudes. Good job, guys."
1297,01:21:02.62,01:21:02.62,"Um, you both have talked about sharing a brain on all the"
1298,01:21:06.17,01:21:06.17,"strategy. Actually, Stephen said J.T. was"
1299,01:21:09.29,01:21:09.29,an asset to him getting to the final.
1300,01:21:12.12,01:21:12.12,"J.T., was Stephen an asset for you in getting to the final, as"
1301,01:21:15.12,01:21:15.12,"well, and why? >> I think Stephen did help me"
1302,01:21:18.38,01:21:18.38,as far as keeping each other in check.
1303,01:21:21.17,01:21:21.17,But could I do it without him? I feel like I could have made
1304,01:21:25.17,01:21:25.17,"this adventure without him, but I don't think it would have been"
1305,01:21:28.12,01:21:28.12,"near as easy. >> Stephen, you want to reply"
1306,01:21:30.17,01:21:30.17,to that? >> I think J.T. and my
1307,01:21:33.88,01:21:33.88,partnership was unique. I'm sorry that he devalues it
1308,01:21:36.08,01:21:36.08,like that. It hurts me a lot.
1309,01:21:38.58,01:21:38.58,"I mean, to say that, ""Oh, yeah, it could be you, it could be"
1310,01:21:41.46,01:21:41.46,"someone else,"" when we worked so well together."
1311,01:21:43.88,01:21:43.88,"You know, that obviously, I don't think that's true."
1312,01:21:45.71,01:21:45.71,I don't think that's true for either of us.
1313,01:21:47.83,01:21:47.83,"I don't think it's true for him, and I don't think it's true for"
1314,01:21:50.17,01:21:50.17,me. >> Do you think you would have
1315,01:21:52.50,01:21:52.50,been sitting here had someone else won immunity last night?
1316,01:21:54.83,01:21:54.83,">> That's a complicated question, right?"
1317,01:21:56.62,01:21:56.62,"Like, who's gonna be...? Who is it?"
1318,01:21:58.29,01:21:58.29,I think Erinn would have taken me.
1319,01:22:00.75,01:22:00.75,I think Taj would have taken me. >> Okay.
1320,01:22:03.04,01:22:03.04,">> So, yeah. >> Are we done on that?"
1321,01:22:05.04,01:22:05.04,>> Yeah. >> Okay.
1322,01:22:07.04,01:22:07.04,"Thanks, boys. >> PROBST: Thanks, Tyson."
1323,01:22:09.04,01:22:09.04,Taj. Finish us off.
1324,01:22:17.50,01:22:17.50,">> Crushed, betrayed, extremely disappointed."
1325,01:22:20.92,01:22:20.92,It's not so much that I'm on the jury right now.
1326,01:22:23.25,01:22:23.25,It's just the way I went to the jury.
1327,01:22:25.83,01:22:25.83,I just felt it was so unnecessary.
1328,01:22:28.12,01:22:28.12,But that's the nature of the game.
1329,01:22:30.38,01:22:30.38,"So my first question, I guess, would be to J.T."
1330,01:22:32.88,01:22:32.88,You found it so hard to put Coach's name down on the paper.
1331,01:22:36.12,01:22:36.12,You don't want to lie to him. But it seemed like it was
1332,01:22:38.88,01:22:38.88,effortless to put my name down on the paper.
1333,01:22:41.17,01:22:41.17,Did you not think that it would be hard to lie to me?
1334,01:22:44.33,01:22:44.33,">> Taj, there was nothing effortless about putting your"
1335,01:22:46.29,01:22:46.29,name down. The hardest vote I made in this
1336,01:22:48.75,01:22:48.75,"game was voting you out. Taj, I've stuck my neck out for"
1337,01:22:52.17,01:22:52.17,"you this whole game, as well as you for me."
1338,01:22:54.71,01:22:54.71,We've been like brother and sister.
1339,01:22:56.96,01:22:56.96,"I mean, it was almost harder than my vote last night."
1340,01:23:01.67,01:23:01.67,">> And Stephen, I saw things in you that I just... I didn't even"
1341,01:23:05.50,01:23:05.50,recognize on the last two or three days.
1342,01:23:08.62,01:23:08.62,"Especially you, because you, from, like, day one, was in my"
1343,01:23:12.71,01:23:12.71,back pocket. We-We were tight.
1344,01:23:15.17,01:23:15.17,At least I thought. Was it so important to blindside
1345,01:23:17.71,01:23:17.71,"me to get me out, because was I that much of a threat?"
1346,01:23:20.46,01:23:20.46,">> All right, I guess, I mean, the truth is J.T. had been"
1347,01:23:24.17,01:23:24.17,talking about taking you out next for a while.
1348,01:23:26.04,01:23:26.04,I had wanted to keep you around until three.
1349,01:23:29.58,01:23:29.58,And part of that was because it would be a great statement for
1350,01:23:32.62,01:23:32.62,"the Jalapao three, to end up, you know, facing this entire"
1351,01:23:36.92,01:23:36.92,Timbira jury. But J.T. was concerned that
1352,01:23:40.12,01:23:40.12,you were a tougher physical competitor to beat.
1353,01:23:42.79,01:23:42.79,"I got nervous that you wouldn't take me, and sort of gave in on"
1354,01:23:45.92,01:23:45.92,the point. So that's why I ended up
1355,01:23:48.42,01:23:48.42,"agreeing to vote you out. >> Taj, I'd like to add, he just"
1356,01:23:51.42,01:23:51.42,made it sound like it was just my idea to take you out.
1357,01:23:54.29,01:23:54.29,That's not true. That's not true at all.
1358,01:23:57.42,01:23:57.42,And I'll tell him that any day of the week.
1359,01:24:00.08,01:24:00.08,"He made... He just made himself sound like, you know, he was the"
1360,01:24:02.83,01:24:02.83,one protecting you. That's-That's not how it went
1361,01:24:05.08,01:24:05.08,"down. >> Well, I mean, to be fair,"
1362,01:24:07.12,01:24:07.12,"then, if... Let's air our laundry."
1363,01:24:09.17,01:24:09.17,"There have been other times when J.T. wanted to take you out, and"
1364,01:24:13.17,01:24:13.17,I talked him out of it. The first was in Jalapao.
1365,01:24:15.79,01:24:15.79,"Because you had given us possession of the idol, J.T."
1366,01:24:19.50,01:24:19.50,thought we could eliminate you and safely have the idol.
1367,01:24:21.62,01:24:21.62,">> You told me, ""I've got the idol."
1368,01:24:23.46,01:24:23.46,"She won't have the idol if we vote her out now."""
1369,01:24:25.92,01:24:25.92,">> No, no, no. You said... >> No, no."
1370,01:24:27.62,01:24:27.62,">> No, no, no, that's not what happened."
1371,01:24:29.25,01:24:29.25,That is not what happened. I said...
1372,01:24:31.21,01:24:31.21,>> You know what? It's neither here nor there.
1373,01:24:33.25,01:24:33.25,That's fine. >> There were times when I saved
1374,01:24:35.25,01:24:35.25,"you, and J.T. wanted to take you out."
1375,01:24:37.71,01:24:37.71,>> That's fine. Thank you. >> Is this the same guy I
1376,01:24:39.79,01:24:39.79,brought with me? >> Yes.
1377,01:24:41.46,01:24:41.46,">> What are you...? Oh, come on now."
1378,01:24:43.25,01:24:43.25,"You have been slandering me all night, and I have... I..."
1379,01:24:45.21,01:24:45.21,This is the first time I ever took a shot at you.
1380,01:24:47.67,01:24:47.67,>> But mine have been all accurate.
1381,01:24:49.67,01:24:49.67,">> And mine have been true... That is true, as well."
1382,01:24:51.79,01:24:51.79,"This... Come on, now. Our friendship means more to me"
1383,01:24:55.17,01:24:55.17,than winning does. >> But you'd have brought Erinn.
1384,01:24:59.08,01:24:59.08,>> I never made that decision in my heart.
1385,01:25:01.38,01:25:01.38,"I mean, you can believe me, or you can..."
1386,01:25:04.67,01:25:04.67,"You know, that's fine. >> I just feel like a fool, man."
1387,01:25:09.08,01:25:09.08,">> Oh, come on, now. I mean... Oh, look, whatever."
1388,01:25:12.21,01:25:12.21,"All right. >> PROBST: Jury, some great"
1389,01:25:15.17,01:25:15.17,questions. Some very revealing answers.
1390,01:25:18.62,01:25:18.62,"You now, hopefully, have enough information to make a"
1391,01:25:21.58,01:25:21.58,million-dollar decision. I'm going to give you a moment
1392,01:25:25.25,01:25:25.25,to think about that very big vote.
1393,01:25:44.12,01:25:44.12,">> PROBST: All right, jury, you have had your chance to address"
1394,01:25:47.17,01:25:47.17,Stephen and J.T. Now it is time to make a very
1395,01:25:50.12,01:25:50.12,big vote. Tonight you are voting for a
1396,01:25:52.62,01:25:52.62,winner. The name you write down is the
1397,01:25:55.79,01:25:55.79,name of the person you think is most deserving of the title of
1398,01:25:58.92,01:25:58.92,sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes
1399,01:26:01.54,01:26:01.54,"along with it. For the last time, it is time"
1400,01:26:04.96,01:26:04.96,"to vote. Brendan, you're up."
1401,01:26:24.71,01:26:24.71,>> Nice job. >> I am a woman of my word.
1402,01:26:38.29,01:26:38.29,You should try to be a man the same way.
1403,01:27:23.75,01:27:23.75,">> PROBST: For the last time, I'll go tally the votes."
1404,01:27:43.25,01:27:43.25,Thank you all for a great season of Survivor.
1405,01:27:46.04,01:27:46.04,I will see you back in New York City for the reading of the
1406,01:27:49.21,01:27:49.21,votes. (cheers and applause)
1407,01:28:34.17,01:28:34.17,>> PROBST: All right. That's what we like.
1408,01:28:40.33,01:28:40.33,Glad to have you guys here. All right.
1409,01:28:47.17,01:28:47.17,Have a seat. Good live audience tonight.
1410,01:28:53.33,01:28:53.33,I like it. (fan shouts)
1411,01:28:56.79,01:28:56.79,"(audience laughing) >> PROBST: I love you, too."
1412,01:29:00.46,01:29:00.46,"All right, jury, nice job. Stephen..."
1413,01:29:06.21,01:29:06.21,"J.T., great job. This is a hard game to play."
1414,01:29:11.04,01:29:11.04,39 days in the middle of nowhere stuck with people you don't know
1415,01:29:16.21,01:29:16.21,"that you may like, may not like, in a game that is physically,"
1416,01:29:19.46,01:29:19.46,"emotionally, mentally taxing 24 hours a day is no small feat."
1417,01:29:25.04,01:29:25.04,The winner of this game deserves the million dollars.
1418,01:29:28.17,01:29:28.17,>> J.T.! (audience laughing)
1419,01:29:30.96,01:29:30.96,>> Stephen! >> Thank you.
1420,01:29:33.04,01:29:33.04,>> PROBST: We got people that want J.T.
1421,01:29:34.96,01:29:34.96,We got people that want Stephen. Let's get to it.
1422,01:29:36.58,01:29:36.58,"There are seven votes in here. Tonight, you want to see your"
1423,01:29:38.83,01:29:38.83,name. This is only time on Survivor
1424,01:29:40.67,01:29:40.67,you want to see your name on the parchment.
1425,01:29:42.67,01:29:42.67,These are votes for a winner. It takes four votes to win.
1426,01:29:46.79,01:29:46.79,I'll read the votes. First vote.
1427,01:29:55.08,01:29:55.08,J.T. (cheering)
1428,01:30:04.58,01:30:04.58,"Second vote. The warrior, J.T."
1429,01:30:08.46,01:30:08.46,(cheering) J.T.
1430,01:30:22.42,01:30:22.42,"That's three votes, J.T. (cheering)"
1431,01:30:29.67,01:30:29.67,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Will Stephen keep it"
1432,01:30:33.42,01:30:33.42,"going, or will it be a blowout? The winner of Survivor:"
1433,01:30:39.83,01:30:39.83,Tocantins. J.T.
