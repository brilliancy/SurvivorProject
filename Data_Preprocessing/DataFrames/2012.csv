2,00:00:03.58,00:00:03.58,unpredictable season... only one thing was certain.
3,00:00:09.08,00:00:09.08,>> He's threatening Russell Hantz.
4,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,"When you do that, you go. >> PROBST: Anyone who targeted"
5,00:00:13.75,00:00:13.75,"Russell... >> Watch your back, man."
6,00:00:15.75,00:00:15.75,">> Same thing for you, man. >> PROBST: ...found themselves"
7,00:00:18.12,00:00:18.12,"blindsided instead. Tyson, Boston Rob, Coach,"
8,00:00:22.46,00:00:22.46,Courtney. The tribe has spoken.
9,00:00:25.21,00:00:25.21,He achieved his goals with lies and deception.
10,00:00:28.17,00:00:28.17,">> This is where I stand. Hook, line, and sinker."
11,00:00:34.62,00:00:34.62,>> PROBST: The only person to cross Russell and still
12,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,"survive... >> Yeah, I trust you."
13,00:00:39.12,00:00:39.12,">> PROBST: ...was Sandra. >> But whatever Russell says,"
14,00:00:41.12,00:00:41.12,"he's lying. >> PROBST: Behind his back, she"
15,00:00:43.17,00:00:43.17,convinced the Heroes to join forces with her and take him
16,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,out. >> You want Russell gone?
17,00:00:47.25,00:00:47.25,>> Yeah. >> Russell's gone.
18,00:00:49.50,00:00:49.50,>> PROBST: But Candice saw an opportunity to further her own
19,00:00:52.12,00:00:52.12,"game and joined up with Russell, warning him he was in trouble."
20,00:00:58.21,00:00:58.21,>> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: With her plans
21,00:01:00.29,00:01:00.29,"betrayed, Sandra was forced to rejoin the Villains."
22,00:01:02.83,00:01:02.83,>> You're saying you're going to vote for me?
23,00:01:04.88,00:01:04.88,">> No, nobody's going to vote for you."
24,00:01:07.25,00:01:07.25,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, a frightened Russell played the"
25,00:01:10.08,00:01:10.08,"hidden immunity idol. >> Russell's super-paranoid, and"
26,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,that is going to be his downfall.
27,00:01:15.08,00:01:15.08,>> PROBST: Russell wasted his idol because both Candice and
28,00:01:17.83,00:01:17.83,Sandra voted with the Villains...
29,00:01:20.04,00:01:20.04,"Amanda, the tribe has spoken. ...leaving the Heroes in their"
30,00:01:24.67,00:01:24.67,toughest position so far. What they don't know is that
31,00:01:28.29,00:01:28.29,"tonight, there will be two immunity challenges, two Tribal"
32,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,"Councils, and two more survivors will meet their fate."
33,00:01:46.25,00:01:46.25,>> Tribal Council is interesting.
34,00:01:48.54,00:01:48.54,"Candice-- she helped us out, in that one vote, gets some"
35,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,"numbers, and now she's a threat. Someone who flips over that"
36,00:01:56.17,00:01:56.17,"quickly to our side will just as easily flip-flop back, so we"
37,00:01:59.12,00:01:59.12,"don't really need her anymore. >> Candice was a pitiful player,"
38,00:02:27.12,00:02:27.12,and she just proved it to me tonight.
39,00:02:30.12,00:02:30.12,She deserved to be on the Villains' tribe.
40,00:02:32.71,00:02:32.71,Colby and I are standing out on a sinking ship now.
41,00:02:36.75,00:02:36.75,There are no other Heroes. (bird squawking)
42,00:02:54.12,00:02:54.12,(squeaking) >> It's going to be fun from
43,00:03:03.25,00:03:03.25,now on. >> Nah. Just-Just Rupert and
44,00:03:08.92,00:03:08.92,Colby's not talking to me. >> Oh. Oh...
45,00:03:10.96,00:03:10.96,">> Their feelings are hurt. I mean, what game do they think"
46,00:03:14.46,00:03:14.46,they're playing? You know what I mean?
47,00:03:18.46,00:03:18.46,">> I think Russell is a deceitful person, and anything"
48,00:03:21.88,00:03:21.88,he says is a lie. He could be worse than Jonny
49,00:03:26.67,00:03:26.67,Fairplay. He is.
50,00:03:29.67,00:03:29.67,"With all that building up inside of me, I have to say"
51,00:03:32.75,00:03:32.75,something this morning to Russell.
52,00:03:35.21,00:03:35.21,My only hope is to show the Villains that disgusting side
53,00:03:42.83,00:03:42.83,"and ask them, truly, do they want to be involved in that?"
54,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,"I'll tell you what, man. You've already proven yourself"
55,00:03:51.21,00:03:51.21,"to be a disgusting, terrible human being to swear on your"
56,00:03:55.00,00:03:55.00,"kids' life. >> Well, you know what, Rupe?"
57,00:03:59.00,00:03:59.00,"It is the game, and you really ... for yourself."
58,00:04:02.29,00:04:02.29,">> If you want to swear on your kids' life and call it the game,"
59,00:04:05.54,00:04:05.54,that's fine. I've played the game twice.
60,00:04:07.62,00:04:07.62,"People see, I'm not that liar. >> Do you think I care about how"
61,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,I ... look to you as a man? >> I think you don't give a damn
62,00:04:13.25,00:04:13.25,about anything but yourself. >> I don't give a ... about you
63,00:04:15.33,00:04:15.33,or your family. >> I know. I don't think you
64,00:04:17.67,00:04:17.67,"give a damn about anybody but yourself, and your team should"
65,00:04:19.96,00:04:19.96,"know that. >> Rupert, I'm a villain."
66,00:04:21.96,00:04:21.96,I'm here so I just can make your life hell.
67,00:04:25.79,00:04:25.79,"The great powerful Rupert, the good guy."
68,00:04:28.62,00:04:28.62,">> You know, you can say... >> The second coming of Christ--"
69,00:04:30.79,00:04:30.79,Rupert. >> You can say whatever you
70,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,"want, because it doesn't really matter anymore."
71,00:04:35.25,00:04:35.25,"(Russell laughs) >> You're such a dumb ass,"
72,00:04:37.29,00:04:37.29,Rupert. I don't want Rupert here because
73,00:04:41.12,00:04:41.12,"Rupert's sitting there, trying to stir up stuff, trying to make"
74,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,"me mad. I'm just telling him, ""Pack"
75,00:04:46.42,00:04:46.42,"your stuff, partner. Pack your stuff."
76,00:04:48.50,00:04:48.50,"Get your tie-dye ready 'cause you're going home."""
77,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's"
78,00:05:05.04,00:05:05.04,challenge? >> Yes.
79,00:05:07.04,00:05:07.04,">> PROBST: Today, you are not playing for reward."
80,00:05:09.25,00:05:09.25,You're playing for immunity. One of you going home tonight
81,00:05:12.04,00:05:12.04,at Tribal Council. >> Oh!
82,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,">> PROBST: First things first, Jerri."
83,00:05:16.04,00:05:16.04,You know I got to take it back. >> It was fun while it lasted.
84,00:05:22.71,00:05:22.71,">> PROBST: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
85,00:05:25.21,00:05:25.21,"For today's challenge, you will be standing barefoot on a small"
86,00:05:28.75,00:05:28.75,wooden perch with your arm raised about your head.
87,00:05:32.08,00:05:32.08,Your hand will be tethered to a bucket.
88,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"When your hand drops, the bucket tips, you're out of the"
89,00:05:37.21,00:05:37.21,challenge. Last person left standing wins
90,00:05:40.83,00:05:40.83,"immunity. To make it interesting, I will"
91,00:05:43.42,00:05:43.42,tempt you by offering you food items.
92,00:05:47.12,00:05:47.12,One other thing-- a twist which will be revealed at the end of
93,00:05:51.12,00:05:51.12,this challenge. Take your positions.
94,00:05:54.21,00:05:54.21,"We'll get started. All right, this challenge is"
95,00:05:58.75,00:05:58.75,underway. Rupert competed in a variation
96,00:06:05.88,00:06:05.88,of this challenge. Lasted a couple of hours.
97,00:06:08.75,00:06:08.75,"Parvati won this challenge in Fans vs. Favorites, lasting"
98,00:06:12.04,00:06:12.04,over six hours. But there's one difference-- the
99,00:06:16.21,00:06:16.21,perch you're on today is a new addition.
100,00:06:19.08,00:06:19.08,"It makes it a little tougher. All right, are you guys ready to"
101,00:06:28.38,00:06:28.38,"be tempted? >> I want it, Jeff."
102,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,>> PROBST: You want out? You don't even know what it is.
103,00:06:36.04,00:06:36.04,">> I don't care. Whatever it is, I want it."
104,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,">> I want it, too, Jeff. >> PROBST: So, wait."
105,00:06:39.71,00:06:39.71,"Sandra and Russell, you both want it without seeing?"
106,00:06:41.58,00:06:41.58,">> Yup. >> Yeah, I don't care what it"
107,00:06:43.58,00:06:43.58,is. >> PROBST: Step down then.
108,00:06:45.58,00:06:45.58,>> For real? >> PROBST: Step down.

116,00:07:07.21,00:07:07.21,"Oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip. >> Oh, my God!"
117,00:07:09.21,00:07:09.21,">> Oh! Oh, these cookies are off the"
118,00:07:12.33,00:07:12.33,hook. You guys don't know what you're
119,00:07:14.92,00:07:14.92,"missing. >> PROBST: Down to six, just"
120,00:07:17.50,00:07:17.50,like that. >> Uh-oh.
121,00:07:31.17,00:07:31.17,He's back. >> PROBST: Next item.
122,00:07:35.21,00:07:35.21,">> Donuts! >> Oh, my God!"
123,00:07:37.21,00:07:37.21,>> PROBST: Four donuts and an iced coffee.
124,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,>> Damn! >> Oh!
125,00:07:41.58,00:07:41.58,>> PROBST: I'll give you guys 30 seconds to think about this
126,00:07:44.08,00:07:44.08,before I give them to Sandra and Russell.
127,00:07:46.46,00:07:46.46,>> What? (Sandra laughs and mumbles)
128,00:07:48.46,00:07:48.46,">> All right, I'll take it, Jeff."
129,00:07:50.67,00:07:50.67,>> PROBST: Colby wants it. Anybody else want in?
130,00:07:53.00,00:07:53.00,"Drop out, Donaldson. Rise to avoid the green."
131,00:07:56.12,00:07:56.12,>> Oh. >> Ninja Turtle style.
132,00:07:58.12,00:07:58.12,">> PROBST: All yours, brother. >> Thanks."
133,00:08:01.79,00:08:01.79,>> PROBST: We are down to five people left in this challenge.
134,00:08:05.17,00:08:05.17,(Jerri exhales loudly) >> PROBST: I have another item.
135,00:08:34.04,00:08:34.04,Let's see if I can get somebody else to give up immunity.
136,00:08:36.75,00:08:36.75,">> Oh. >> Oh, my God."
137,00:08:38.75,00:08:38.75,>> What is it? >> Peanut butter and jelly?

141,00:08:46.83,00:08:46.83,>> I think I'm gonna take this one.
142,00:08:49.12,00:08:49.12,>> I want to take it. >> I'll take it.
143,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,">> I'll wait. >> PROBST: So Danielle, Candice"
144,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,and Jerri are all coming down to share this.
145,00:08:55.25,00:08:55.25,Step off. >> Oh.
146,00:09:03.00,00:09:03.00,>> Your pants just came off. >> I hate you bitches.
147,00:09:05.04,00:09:05.04,(laughing) >> PROBST: Peanut butter and

150,00:09:11.71,00:09:11.71,>> Best sandwich I ever had. >> Mm-hmm.
151,00:09:13.75,00:09:13.75,">> PROBST: And just like that, we are down to two."
152,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,"Parvati on one end, Rupert on the other."
153,00:09:20.88,00:09:20.88,Both fighting for immunity. We could be here a long time.
154,00:09:39.83,00:09:39.83,>> PROBST: Been out here over an hour.
155,00:09:56.29,00:09:56.29,>> Ooh ... >> There he goes.
156,00:09:58.92,00:09:58.92,>> Damn it! >> PROBST: Rupert drops out of
157,00:10:01.79,00:10:01.79,the challenge. Parvati wins immunity.
158,00:10:03.83,00:10:03.83,">> Oh. >> Girl, congratulations."
159,00:10:05.83,00:10:05.83,">> Good job, Parvati. >> Good work, Rupert."
160,00:10:07.83,00:10:07.83,">> PROBST: What happened, Rupert?"
161,00:10:09.83,00:10:09.83,>> Slipped. (scoffs) I could have made it hours.
162,00:10:12.79,00:10:12.79,So I go home tonight. Done.
163,00:10:16.04,00:10:16.04,">> PROBST: Parvati, congratulations."
164,00:10:18.25,00:10:18.25,">> Thank you, Jeff. >> PROBST: This challenge likes"

169,00:10:30.92,00:10:30.92,"this game for the second time. All right, guys, now to the"
170,00:10:35.71,00:10:35.71,twist I mentioned at the start of this challenge.
171,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17,This is a clue to a hidden immunity idol at your camp.
172,00:10:42.12,00:10:42.12,"""All hope is not lost if you suffer defeat."
173,00:10:47.00,00:10:47.00,Salvation is hidden where two paths meet.
174,00:10:51.21,00:10:51.21,A burning bush throws a shadow on top of a stone under which
175,00:10:56.62,00:10:56.62,"lies the key to not going home."" Have a fun afternoon."
176,00:11:01.67,00:11:01.67,I will see you tonight at Tribal Council.
177,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,">> At the challenge, Jeff read a clue to the immunity idol."
178,00:11:21.04,00:11:21.04,"So the minute we get to camp, all of a sudden, people just"
179,00:11:24.92,00:11:24.92,started running. >> We're gonna have to split up.
180,00:11:27.04,00:11:27.04,Y'all go on that one. >> Parvati!
181,00:11:29.54,00:11:29.54,">> The clue said, there'll be a burning bush, and in the"
182,00:11:33.25,00:11:33.25,shadow there'll be the immunity idol.
183,00:11:35.92,00:11:35.92,"Is this a burning bush? >> It's red, isn't it?"
184,00:11:39.08,00:11:39.08,">> I thought it meant, like, a bush that's on fire."
185,00:11:41.46,00:11:41.46,>> There's no bush on fire. >> What the hell's a burning
186,00:11:44.08,00:11:44.08,bush? >> What is this thing?
187,00:11:45.92,00:11:45.92,>> A dead tree. >> It's just a dead tree.
188,00:11:50.79,00:11:50.79,>> Candice and Russell start digging where there's this big
189,00:11:54.12,00:11:54.12,"red bush. But across from there, there's"
190,00:11:56.54,00:11:56.54,"another big red bush, so I start digging..."
191,00:11:59.54,00:11:59.54,and I see it. Let me see what it says.
192,00:12:12.08,00:12:12.08,I can't believe I finally found something.
193,00:12:15.08,00:12:15.08,Um... I'm nervous-- I can't read this
194,00:12:19.00,00:12:19.00,out here. I don't know where to put this.
195,00:12:21.67,00:12:21.67,"It's too big. Oh, no, it's too bulgy."
196,00:12:36.12,00:12:36.12,>> You think it's on these trails?
197,00:12:38.08,00:12:38.08,">> Well, I mean, these aren't really trails, right?"
198,00:12:42.08,00:12:42.08,">> Even though I don't have the idol, maybe I can play like I"
199,00:12:46.12,00:12:46.12,"do. I stuck me a rock in my pocket,"
200,00:12:52.21,00:12:52.21,"making it look a little dangly, a little big."
201,00:12:55.71,00:12:55.71,This isn't my first game of Survivor.
202,00:12:58.12,00:12:58.12,I'm just trying to stay in it another day.
203,00:13:04.17,00:13:04.17,">> What's happening, Rupe? Feel like we're Easter egg"
204,00:13:06.92,00:13:06.92,huntin'. >> Yeah.
205,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,>> I have a lot of experience with idols.
206,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,"Rupert has a big, bulky thing in his pocket."
207,00:13:18.00,00:13:18.00,It's the idol wrapped up in the paper.
208,00:13:20.96,00:13:20.96,"Now, we have to get rid of the idol, so how are we going to do"
209,00:13:24.42,00:13:24.42,this? It's easy-- we'll split the
210,00:13:26.08,00:13:26.08,"votes tonight. If he don't play it, he goes"
211,00:13:28.71,00:13:28.71,home. That's how we'll do it.
212,00:13:30.54,00:13:30.54,">> I don't know, I think everybody pretty much gave up."
213,00:13:33.04,00:13:33.04,>> He found it. I see it in his pocket.
214,00:13:35.25,00:13:35.25,I know exactly how they look. And I know exactly how they
215,00:13:37.83,00:13:37.83,look in a pocket. >> Russell swears that Rupert
216,00:13:44.50,00:13:44.50,"found the idol. Of course, I know that's a lie,"
217,00:13:47.29,00:13:47.29,'cause I have the freakin' immunity idol.
218,00:13:49.17,00:13:49.17,"And if they think Rupert has it, that's good for Sandra."
219,00:13:52.92,00:13:52.92,"So I'm not going to say nothing. >> No, we'll split the votes,"
220,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,three-three. >> Why?
221,00:14:03.79,00:14:03.79,>> To get the idol out of Rupert's hands.
222,00:14:06.25,00:14:06.25,">> We have to flush it out. >> Oh, right."
223,00:14:08.12,00:14:08.12,>> So we have to split the votes.
224,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,>> (whispers): It's perfect. >> Colby and Candice are both
225,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,threats in different ways. That's why it's a hard decision.
226,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,"Candice voted with us to vote out Amanda, and I really think"
227,00:14:28.96,00:14:28.96,she's going to stay loyal to us. Colby's not really doing any
228,00:14:31.79,00:14:31.79,"kind of strategizing, so I feel like I can get him to do"
229,00:14:35.58,00:14:35.58,"whatever. I don't know, I mean, either"
230,00:14:37.75,00:14:37.75,"way, we're rolling the dice. >> Right now we need to be safe"
231,00:14:41.25,00:14:41.25,and make sure that idol is out of Rupert's hands.
232,00:14:44.00,00:14:44.00,>> Yeah. >> Here's how it's gonna work.
233,00:14:48.71,00:14:48.71,"They're going to split the votes tonight, 'cause they"
234,00:14:51.12,00:14:51.12,"got six of them, right? So they're going to send half"
235,00:14:53.75,00:14:53.75,"of them your way, and the other half are either going to go"
236,00:14:56.17,00:14:56.17,towards me or towards Candice. >> If three of them vote for
237,00:14:58.92,00:14:58.92,"Candice, then you and I vote for Candice, there's five votes"
238,00:15:01.29,00:15:01.29,for Candice. >> And even if three of them
239,00:15:04.12,00:15:04.12,"vote for you and you don't have the idol, you're still safe."
240,00:15:06.67,00:15:06.67,>> There's still five votes for Candice.
241,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,>> Exactly. I could be going home tonight if it doesn't
242,00:15:11.21,00:15:11.21,"work, but if it does, me and you get to vote Candice out."
243,00:15:13.96,00:15:13.96,">> Oh, God! That would be... >> And then we've still got a"
244,00:15:17.75,00:15:17.75,shot. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
245,00:15:31.00,00:15:31.00,the members of our jury. Coach... Courtney...
246,00:15:36.04,00:15:36.04,"J.T., and Amanda, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
247,00:15:42.33,00:15:42.33,"All right, Rupert, let's pick up with the last Tribal Council."
248,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,Amanda's voted out. You all go back to camp.
249,00:15:48.17,00:15:48.17,"What's the fallout? >> The fallout was, we realized"
250,00:15:51.42,00:15:51.42,there's only two Heroes left. There's Colby and I.
251,00:15:55.38,00:15:55.38,Candice jumped to the Villains' side.
252,00:15:57.79,00:15:57.79,">> PROBST: Candice, you're shaking your head."
253,00:15:59.50,00:15:59.50,Is that not true? >> It was obvious that Amanda
254,00:16:02.92,00:16:02.92,was going to go home whether I voted for her or not.
255,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,"You know, Amanda had a target on her back because she's a"
256,00:16:08.75,00:16:08.75,"strong, strategic player. So it wasn't like my vote was"
257,00:16:12.04,00:16:12.04,the nail in the coffin to send her home.
258,00:16:14.58,00:16:14.58,The numbers were already there. >> I have no respect for the
259,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,excuses. >> It's not going to get me any
260,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,further in the game to go down on a sinking ship.
261,00:16:22.46,00:16:22.46,">> Well, then that's what you should have said, that right"
262,00:16:24.38,00:16:24.38,there. >> Exactly right.
263,00:16:26.33,00:16:26.33,">> ""This is a game for a million dollars."
264,00:16:28.58,00:16:28.58,"This was my best play."" >> PROBST: So, Russell, as a"
265,00:16:32.08,00:16:32.08,"strategy, Candice put herself ahead of Colby and Rupert, and"
266,00:16:35.12,00:16:35.12,that will keep her in the game longer.
267,00:16:37.42,00:16:37.42,"Good move. >> Yeah, it's her best move."
268,00:16:40.67,00:16:40.67,"She goes to the Villains' side at number six, and unless"
269,00:16:44.46,00:16:44.46,"you're going to give all the Villains a million dollars,"
270,00:16:46.71,00:16:46.71,something has to break within the Villains-- so she could have
271,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,made a great move. >> PROBST: So if history
272,00:16:52.58,00:16:52.58,"repeats, now we're looking at Rupert or Colby in trouble"
273,00:16:57.12,00:16:57.12,tonight. >> What am I supposed to say?
274,00:16:59.17,00:16:59.17,I'm going to get rid of my Villain partners out here?
275,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,"No, that ain't gonna happen. We got two Heroes that's gonna"
276,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"have to go sooner or later, and the consensus is that Rupert"
277,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"goes, so... >> PROBST: Rupert, after the"
278,00:17:11.92,00:17:11.92,"challenge was over, I read a clue where another idol was"
279,00:17:15.71,00:17:15.71,hidden. You get back to camp-- what
280,00:17:17.67,00:17:17.67,happens? >> We got home from our
281,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,challenge. I calmly took my sandals off and
282,00:17:23.08,00:17:23.08,went for a walk in the jungle and stayed until I felt
283,00:17:27.42,00:17:27.42,"comfortable. >> PROBST: So, Russell, you"
284,00:17:29.54,00:17:29.54,"think that idol's out there, or do you think Colby or Rupert has"
285,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,"the idol? >> If they don't, then they"
286,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,gave up. And I don't think Colby or
287,00:17:39.96,00:17:39.96,"Rupert would give up. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
288,00:17:44.88,00:17:44.88,to the vote. Parvati has the immunity
289,00:17:46.62,00:17:46.62,necklace. Cannot vote for Parvati.
290,00:17:48.04,00:17:48.04,"Everybody else is fair game. Colby, you're up."
291,00:17:56.83,00:17:56.83,>> I can honestly say I'm proud of the way I played this game.
292,00:18:01.25,00:18:01.25,"Can you? >> My mom always told me, if you"
293,00:18:19.38,00:18:19.38,"don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all."
294,00:18:43.88,00:18:43.88,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
295,00:18:56.00,00:18:56.00,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
296,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
297,00:19:21.08,00:19:21.08,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
298,00:19:23.79,00:19:23.79,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
299,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
300,00:19:33.25,00:19:33.25,First vote... >> PROBST: Once the votes are
301,00:19:46.75,00:19:46.75,"read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
302,00:19:49.12,00:19:49.12,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
303,00:19:51.12,00:19:51.12,I'll read the votes. First vote...
304,00:19:57.79,00:19:57.79,Rupert. Rupert.
305,00:20:01.75,00:20:01.75,That's two votes Rupert. Rupert.
306,00:20:06.25,00:20:06.25,That's three votes Rupert. Candice.
307,00:20:11.33,00:20:11.33,One vote Candice. Candice.
308,00:20:16.42,00:20:16.42,"That's three votes Rupert, two votes Candice."
309,00:20:21.79,00:20:21.79,"Candice. We're tied, three votes Rupert,"
310,00:20:24.29,00:20:24.29,"three votes Candice. That's four votes Candice,"
311,00:20:30.17,00:20:30.17,"three votes Rupert, one vote left."
312,00:20:37.08,00:20:37.08,13th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury...
313,00:20:40.25,00:20:40.25,Candice. You need to bring me your torch.
314,00:20:50.25,00:20:50.25,"Candice, the tribe has spoken. >> Thank you."
315,00:20:53.04,00:20:53.04,"Good luck, you guys. >> PROBST: Time for you to go."
316,00:21:01.29,00:21:01.29,"Well, maybe the lesson learned from tonight's Tribal Council is"
317,00:21:04.96,00:21:04.96,this-- it's a risky move when you betray trust in order to
318,00:21:09.33,00:21:09.33,gain trust. Grab your torches.
319,00:21:11.79,00:21:11.79,Head back to camp. Good night.
320,00:21:19.62,00:21:19.62,">> I definitely got thrown under the bus tonight, um, but I"
321,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,"understand I made a risky move yesterday, and, um, it didn't"
322,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,pay off. So I guess... karma's a bitch
323,00:21:32.25,00:21:32.25,sometimes. >> Wow.
324,00:21:49.38,00:21:49.38,>> We just blew it. We were supposed to split the
325,00:21:52.21,00:21:52.21,"votes for Rupert and Colby, and it didn't happen."
326,00:21:55.62,00:21:55.62,It was a terrible decision. The girls got their heart
327,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,"involved in the game, wanted Candice out of here because"
328,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,"they didn't like her, so everybody blew it."
329,00:22:04.21,00:22:04.21,And I'm one of them. I should have sat them down and
330,00:22:06.08,00:22:06.08,"said, ""No, this is what we're gonna do."""
331,00:22:11.08,00:22:11.08,From the get-go. ...one at a...
332,00:22:22.79,00:22:22.79,Just Rupert alone. >> I'm not fully in control of
333,00:22:34.04,00:22:34.04,this game now. Me and Parvati are equally in
334,00:22:36.96,00:22:36.96,"control, and that makes me a little worried."
335,00:22:40.75,00:22:40.75,But you know what? I'm going to take control of
336,00:22:43.12,00:22:43.12,"this game so fast, they ain't even know what hit them."
337,00:22:55.58,00:22:55.58,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's"
338,00:23:04.62,00:23:04.62,immunity challenge? >> Yes.
339,00:23:06.62,00:23:06.62,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first.
340,00:23:08.62,00:23:08.62,"Parvati, it looks like you're ready to give it up."
341,00:23:12.29,00:23:12.29,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
342,00:23:16.12,00:23:16.12,"For today's challenge, you will each race to get a peg that you"
343,00:23:18.96,00:23:18.96,will use to maneuver through a table maze.
344,00:23:21.62,00:23:21.62,"The first five to finish move on to the next round, where you"
345,00:23:25.67,00:23:25.67,will use four individually-shaped pegs to help
346,00:23:28.25,00:23:28.25,you get to the top of a tall climbing wall.
347,00:23:31.08,00:23:31.08,The first three to get to the top of the wall move on to the
348,00:23:34.25,00:23:34.25,"final round, where you must solve a slide puzzle."
349,00:23:37.12,00:23:37.12,The first person to finish the puzzle wins immunity and is
350,00:23:40.71,00:23:40.71,guaranteed a one-in-six shot at winning this game and the
351,00:23:45.25,00:23:45.25,"million-dollar check. Losers, Tribal Council, where"
352,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,"after 33 days, somebody will be sent home."
353,00:23:51.88,00:23:51.88,"We'll draw for spots, we'll get started."
354,00:23:59.12,00:23:59.12,Here we go. First round.
355,00:24:01.21,00:24:01.21,Survivors ready? Go!
356,00:24:07.75,00:24:07.75,You've got to dig up your peg and then get it through the
357,00:24:11.00,00:24:11.00,"table maze. Rupert has his, and he's off to"
358,00:24:14.38,00:24:14.38,"a fast start. Parvati, Sandra, Danielle have"
359,00:24:24.17,00:24:24.17,theirs. Russell's got his.
360,00:24:27.83,00:24:27.83,Jerri has her peg. Everybody on the maze but Colby.
361,00:24:32.38,00:24:32.38,Colby now has his peg and a lot of time to make up.
362,00:24:40.00,00:24:40.00,Rupert was out very quickly. Russell now doing a good job on
363,00:24:43.33,00:24:43.33,the maze. Rupert very close.
364,00:24:46.67,00:24:46.67,Sandra getting close. Rupert's through.
365,00:24:49.71,00:24:49.71,Rupert moving on. Sandra moving on.
366,00:24:54.75,00:24:54.75,>> I can't believe it. >> PROBST: Russell's moving on.
367,00:25:00.21,00:25:00.21,Parvati moving on. One spot left.
368,00:25:04.33,00:25:04.33,"Three people vying for it. Jerri, Danielle and Colby."
369,00:25:09.12,00:25:09.12,Danielle very close. Danielle moving on.
370,00:25:16.29,00:25:16.29,"Moving on to the next round. It's Rupert, Sandra, Parvati,"
371,00:25:19.83,00:25:19.83,Danielle and Russell. First three to the top of the
372,00:25:22.96,00:25:22.96,wall move on. Survivors ready?
373,00:25:27.21,00:25:27.21,Go! You have four pegs.
374,00:25:30.58,00:25:30.58,Use them as you want. You don't have to use any of
375,00:25:33.25,00:25:33.25,them. Russell gets himself halfway up
376,00:25:38.25,00:25:38.25,the wall by just running. Rupert trying to run up the
377,00:25:40.58,00:25:40.58,wall. You're going to have to run
378,00:25:43.00,00:25:43.00,"harder than that. Meanwhile, Parvati is moving up"
379,00:25:45.04,00:25:45.04,the wall. Danielle making steady progress.
380,00:25:49.58,00:25:49.58,Russell climbing up this wall. Using only two pegs so far.
381,00:25:54.33,00:25:54.33,Russell very close to the top. Russell to the top.
382,00:25:58.96,00:25:58.96,Russell's moving on. Two more spots.
383,00:26:01.54,00:26:01.54,Rupert making up for lost time. Parvati very close.
384,00:26:07.50,00:26:07.50,Rupert to the top. He moves on.
385,00:26:09.96,00:26:09.96,Parvati to the top. She moves on.
386,00:26:12.17,00:26:12.17,"It is Russell, Parvati and Rupert in the final round for"
387,00:26:16.04,00:26:16.04,immunity. >> Damn!
388,00:26:18.12,00:26:18.12,">> Now how do I get down? >> PROBST: All right, here we"
389,00:26:21.12,00:26:21.12,go. The final round.
390,00:26:23.04,00:26:23.04,For immunity. Survivors ready?
391,00:26:25.46,00:26:25.46,Go! It's a slide puzzle.
392,00:26:28.50,00:26:28.50,That means you can't pick up the pieces.
393,00:26:30.79,00:26:30.79,"You have to slide them around, building that very familiar"
394,00:26:34.50,00:26:34.50,Survivor logo. Don't slow down.
395,00:26:38.29,00:26:38.29,Don't lose your concentration. Focus on finishing this puzzle.
396,00:26:43.62,00:26:43.62,Russell starting to get it together a little bit.
397,00:26:49.42,00:26:49.42,>> PROBST: Rupert's now starting to come together with his
398,00:26:51.46,00:26:51.46,puzzle. Parvati falling out of it.
399,00:26:56.21,00:26:56.21,Russell much closer now. Rupert very close.
400,00:27:00.04,00:27:00.04,We are neck and neck. >> Jeff.
401,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,>> PROBST: Russell thinks he has it.
402,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,"Russell wins immunity! >> Way to go, Russell!"
403,00:27:10.21,00:27:10.21,">> Good job, Russell! >> PROBST: Russell, come on"
404,00:27:18.50,00:27:18.50,"over. >> Good job, Russell."
405,00:27:20.71,00:27:20.71,>> PROBST: Russell safe tonight at Tribal Council.
406,00:27:24.12,00:27:24.12,"For the rest of you, after 33 hard-fought days, somebody"
407,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,"going home tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to"
408,00:27:29.25,00:27:29.25,camp. I'll see you at Tribal.
409,00:27:31.04,00:27:31.04,Congrats. >> I was thinking as I walked
410,00:27:34.67,00:27:34.67,"out of that darn challenge, ""You made it so far, and still came"
411,00:27:38.38,00:27:38.38,"up short."" I have to believe in myself,"
412,00:27:43.21,00:27:43.21,because just the lie of a rock in your pocket is not going to
413,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,save you tonight. (thunder crackling)
414,00:28:09.50,00:28:09.50,>> I want Rupert to go home tonight.
415,00:28:12.25,00:28:12.25,He's a Hero. He is not part of our original
416,00:28:15.38,00:28:15.38,tribe of Villains. And I'm pretty sure Rupert does
417,00:28:18.46,00:28:18.46,"not have the idol. So, yeah, I don't feel bad for"
418,00:28:21.04,00:28:21.04,Rupert at all. I think he's kind of dug his
419,00:28:24.12,00:28:24.12,"own grave. The Villain invasion happened,"
420,00:28:27.12,00:28:27.12,and now the Villains are running this place.
421,00:28:30.21,00:28:30.21,There ain't gonna be any Heroes left.
422,00:28:32.54,00:28:32.54,No Heroes. Seriously.
423,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,>> What do you mean locked in...?
424,00:28:44.17,00:28:44.17,">> I mean, we need to be strong, five, and get those two off,"
425,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,"because if those... one of those guys makes it to the end, none"
426,00:28:48.17,00:28:48.17,of us stand a chance. It has to be five Villains...
427,00:28:50.21,00:28:50.21,">> Yeah, I know that. >> ...and that's it."
428,00:28:52.17,00:28:52.17,">> I know that. >> And honestly, right now,"
429,00:28:55.25,00:28:55.25,"we're set up pretty good, because Rupert can go home,"
430,00:28:57.33,00:28:57.33,"Colby's not good in challenges, and he can go home next, you"
431,00:28:59.38,00:28:59.38,"know? >> Parvati and Danielle, to me,"
432,00:29:02.71,00:29:02.71,"they're a team, when it's supposed to be me and Parvati."
433,00:29:06.21,00:29:06.21,And that's a problem. So the only thing I can think of
434,00:29:09.25,00:29:09.25,right now is to break up that couple.
435,00:29:16.00,00:29:16.00,>> You really think so? >> Mm. I wouldn't take her to
436,00:29:18.00,00:29:18.00,the finals. >> Oh.
437,00:29:20.00,00:29:20.00,>> She might try to get rid of you or try to get rid of me.
438,00:29:23.25,00:29:23.25,"Uh, that's going to come. If she tries to get rid of"
439,00:29:25.83,00:29:25.83,"either of us, you know, we can easily bounce out her."
440,00:29:27.83,00:29:27.83,>> Yeah. >> Russell brought up that he
441,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,"wants to get rid of Parvati, but I don't know if we should do"
442,00:29:34.00,00:29:34.00,"that. You know, Parvati's been my"
443,00:29:36.08,00:29:36.08,"alliance since the beginning, and, like, if we are going to"
444,00:29:38.42,00:29:38.42,ever do that-- which I don't know if I am because I'm in a
445,00:29:41.33,00:29:41.33,"tight alliance with her-- but if we are, now is not the time."
446,00:29:44.21,00:29:44.21,"I trust you, like, 110%. I don't have any worries about"
447,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,"you. >> Yeah, I trust you, too."
448,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,>> Danielle came to me. She wants to vote you off when
449,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,it comes down to five or six. >> Why would she want to do
450,00:29:56.04,00:29:56.04,"that? >> And I ain't messing with you,"
451,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,Parvati. You got to...
452,00:30:01.25,00:30:01.25,"As... like I told you, my loyalty lies with you in this"
453,00:30:04.17,00:30:04.17,"game, and that's it. I'm working Danielle."
454,00:30:06.71,00:30:06.71,I'm working Parvati. I'm telling Parvati we've got
455,00:30:08.96,00:30:08.96,to get rid of Danielle. I'm telling Danielle we got
456,00:30:11.04,00:30:11.04,"to get rid of Parvati. So, by working both of them,"
457,00:30:13.21,00:30:13.21,I got both of them under control.
458,00:30:15.50,00:30:15.50,"Parvati's not going to tell Danielle, Danielle's not going"
459,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,"to tell Parvati, 'cause it'd mess up both of their games."
460,00:30:20.58,00:30:20.58,">> Well, I want to talk to her. >> Are you serious?"
461,00:30:25.04,00:30:25.04,">> Yes, I'm serious. >> About what?"
462,00:30:27.04,00:30:27.04,>> You can't just come at me and tell me that my final three from
463,00:30:30.00,00:30:30.00,"day one wants me out. >> Oh, my God."
464,00:30:32.00,00:30:32.00,>> And you think I'm not going to talk to her?
465,00:30:34.04,00:30:34.04,>> You gonna talk to her? >> I'm not going to tell her you
466,00:30:36.04,00:30:36.04,"told me that, but... >> She's going to know..."
467,00:30:38.04,00:30:38.04,>> ...I'm gonna find out what she's saying.
468,00:30:40.08,00:30:40.08,">> Parvati, if you do that, you're out of this game."
469,00:30:42.08,00:30:42.08,I promise you. Are you serious?
470,00:30:44.04,00:30:44.04,You're going to go tell her exactly what I'm trying to keep
471,00:30:46.17,00:30:46.17,"a secret from her? >> I just told you, I'm not"
472,00:30:48.17,00:30:48.17,going to say what you're saying. >> You can't even bring it up.
473,00:30:50.25,00:30:50.25,Go ahead. Do what you think you need to
474,00:30:52.79,00:30:52.79,"do, Parvati. >> Don't yell at me, Russell."
475,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,">> I can't believe you're, you're thinking like this."
476,00:30:58.79,00:30:58.79,>> Thinking like what? Like I want to have a ...
477,00:31:01.08,00:31:01.08,conversation with someone? >> You can't go up to her and
478,00:31:03.04,00:31:03.04,say anything... >> Don't tell me I can't have a
479,00:31:05.21,00:31:05.21,"conversation with someone. >> Okay, all right."
480,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,You go talk to her. You do that.
481,00:31:09.00,00:31:09.00,>> Today should have been Rupert: done.
482,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,"Russell comes out of nowhere and says, ""They're blind-siding"
483,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,"""you. That's what's happening."""
484,00:31:16.00,00:31:16.00,"I'm, like, ""I'm not voting ""Danielle tonight."
485,00:31:18.08,00:31:18.08,"""I don't care what you say. I'm not doing it."""
486,00:31:23.17,00:31:23.17,>> It could be dangerous if Parvati would talk to Danielle
487,00:31:26.12,00:31:26.12,about what I told her that Danielle wants to get rid
488,00:31:29.00,00:31:29.00,of Parvati. It could turn into a problem.
489,00:31:35.88,00:31:35.88,>> She wanted to blind-side you! >> He said that to you?
490,00:31:39.17,00:31:39.17,>> Yes. >> He told me that you came up
491,00:31:41.62,00:31:41.62,to him and said that you wanted to blind-side me now
492,00:31:44.92,00:31:44.92,"because, um, you don't think you can win against me and, like,"
493,00:31:48.25,00:31:48.25,all this other stuff. >> He's such a liar.
494,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,>> But I'm not voting you tonight.
495,00:31:51.75,00:31:51.75,I won't. I refuse. >> So Russell's trying to vote
496,00:31:53.96,00:31:53.96,me out tonight? >> We have to get out Rupert
497,00:31:55.88,00:31:55.88,or Colby. >> I know.
498,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,"He's got this whole thing, like, he wants me and you to be, like,"
499,00:32:00.08,00:32:00.08,at each other's throats... >> I think he's worried that if
500,00:32:02.33,00:32:02.33,"it's at the final three and it's you, me, and him..."
501,00:32:04.75,00:32:04.75,>> He's gonna... >> ...you and I will take each
502,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,"other, and he'll be out. >> I'm-a get Danielle off"
503,00:32:11.92,00:32:11.92,tonight because it eliminates that pair.
504,00:32:15.38,00:32:15.38,"As soon as we get rid of Danielle, Parvati is going to"
505,00:32:18.25,00:32:18.25,"be so scared of me, she's gonna stick to me like glue."
506,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,And she's gonna vote the way I tell her to vote.
507,00:32:23.88,00:32:23.88,"There's only one thing that has to happen today, and that's"
508,00:32:26.79,00:32:26.79,Danielle go home. >> Really?
509,00:32:29.96,00:32:29.96,Really? >> Yeah.
510,00:32:35.96,00:32:35.96,>> It's funny how things change in this game.
511,00:32:38.29,00:32:38.29,">> I know, I know, damn it. >> How did this get flipped"
512,00:32:41.62,00:32:41.62,on me? >> It's crazy.
513,00:32:42.88,00:32:42.88,>> Why? Why do we want to keep Colby and Rupert around?
514,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,That doesn't even make any sense.
515,00:32:46.62,00:32:46.62,>> It doesn't make sense. It does not make sense.
516,00:32:48.79,00:32:48.79,>> Russell running around double talking is hurting
517,00:32:50.58,00:32:50.58,his game. He's getting outplayed by me
518,00:32:53.25,00:32:53.25,"and Danielle at this point, and it's making him a little"
519,00:32:57.08,00:32:57.08,bit crazy. The only thing we have to do is
520,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,make sure Jerri doesn't write your name down.
521,00:33:05.96,00:33:05.96,">> I'm ripping my hair out. Do not change your vote tonight,"
522,00:33:08.12,00:33:08.12,"no matter what he says to you. >> Oh, no, I won't."
523,00:33:10.42,00:33:10.42,>> He's trying to vote me out. >> He's trying to vote her out
524,00:33:12.88,00:33:12.88,tonight. >> It's Rupert.
525,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,>> Insane-o. >> Are you crazy? It's Rupert.
526,00:33:17.21,00:33:17.21,>> He's causing all this... craziness again.
527,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,>> Please don't write my name down tonight.
528,00:33:31.79,00:33:31.79,>> I want Danielle gone tonight.
529,00:33:35.17,00:33:35.17,>> We need to get rid of Rupert. >> Bad move.
530,00:33:38.21,00:33:38.21,You're going to be next. Not 'cause of me.
531,00:33:40.50,00:33:40.50,>> Don't threaten me. >> Not 'cause of me.
532,00:33:42.58,00:33:42.58,"I'm trying to save you. You don't get rid of Danielle,"
533,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,you're gonna be after her. >> Why do you say that?
534,00:33:47.12,00:33:47.12,>> It ain't me. It ain't me. I can't do nothin'.
535,00:33:49.38,00:33:49.38,You have to help me help you. >> Who are you talking about?
536,00:33:52.25,00:33:52.25,Explain to me why that's even... >> I can't.
537,00:33:54.54,00:33:54.54,"I'm telling you now, we have to get rid of Danielle tonight, or"
538,00:33:57.21,00:33:57.21,they will get rid of you. >> PROBST: Now bring in the
539,00:34:17.12,00:34:17.12,members of our jury. Coach... Courtney... J.T....
540,00:34:25.08,00:34:25.08,"Amanda... and Candice, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
541,00:34:32.54,00:34:32.54,"Rupert, who's running this show right now?"
542,00:34:37.33,00:34:37.33,>> I don't know. It's probably between Parvati
543,00:34:40.54,00:34:40.54,"and Russell. >> PROBST: Danielle, ring true"
544,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,to you-- Russell and Parvati pretty much guiding the shots
545,00:34:47.83,00:34:47.83,"over here for the Villains? >> Um, I don't necessarily"
546,00:34:50.75,00:34:50.75,think that's true. I think the Villains make
547,00:34:52.96,00:34:52.96,decisions together. >> PROBST: Really?
548,00:34:54.96,00:34:54.96,"This close to a million dollars, you all agree?"
549,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,">> Yeah, we're still together, aren't we?"
550,00:34:59.17,00:34:59.17,>> PROBST: That doesn't mean you agree.
551,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,>> But we agree voting out the Heroes and sticking together.
552,00:35:05.79,00:35:05.79,">> PROBST: So, Jerri, around camp must be fairly peaceful,"
553,00:35:08.54,00:35:08.54,then. The Villains all agree on the
554,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,"decisions, and Rupert and Colby going, ""It's you or me, dude."""
555,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,">> Hell, no. It's never been quiet since day"
556,00:35:16.12,00:35:16.12,"one playing this game, and it is certainly not quiet right now."
557,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,">> PROBST: So, Danielle, why this illusion that it's one big"
558,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,happy family? >> There was just a
559,00:35:25.33,00:35:25.33,"miscommunication, Jeff, honestly."
560,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"There were things said, and, no, not everybody agreed today, at"
561,00:35:30.33,00:35:30.33,all. It was mad chaos.
562,00:35:33.12,00:35:33.12,">> ""Crazy"" could not describe what happened today."
563,00:35:36.46,00:35:36.46,">> Craziness, crazy, crazy. >> Like, unnecessarily out of"
564,00:35:39.04,00:35:39.04,"control, like... >> Danielle and I were pitted"
565,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,against each other. >> We were pitted against each
566,00:35:43.21,00:35:43.21,"other. >> PROBST: Parvati, what"
567,00:35:47.00,00:35:47.00,happened? >> Well... Russell came to me
568,00:35:50.50,00:35:50.50,and told me that Danielle was trying to blindside me today.
569,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,She said it was not true and went crazy. (laughs)
570,00:35:57.08,00:35:57.08,And so Russell's trying to test loyalty.
571,00:36:00.04,00:36:00.04,That's what I got from the whole thing.
572,00:36:02.83,00:36:02.83,">> PROBST: So, Russell, you got caught."
573,00:36:04.75,00:36:04.75,">> No, I didn't get caught doing nothin'."
574,00:36:06.71,00:36:06.71,"Today, Danielle came up to me before I said anything and said,"
575,00:36:09.79,00:36:09.79,"""When do you... >> Lies. Liar. Liar."
576,00:36:11.38,00:36:11.38,">> ""...when do you want to get rid of..."""
577,00:36:13.04,00:36:13.04,Let me finish talking. Danielle knows where my loyalty
578,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,"lies, and that's with Parvati. If you gonna come up to me..."
579,00:36:17.96,00:36:17.96,">> And me, you've been telling me..."
580,00:36:19.12,00:36:19.12,">> If you gonna come up to me, if you gonna come to me and try"
581,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,to get rid of Parvati... >> For the last...
582,00:36:24.04,00:36:24.04,>> ...then I'm gonna try to get rid of you.
583,00:36:25.88,00:36:25.88,>> You just sat me on the beach and said that you don't want to
584,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,go against Parvati at the end because you think...
585,00:36:30.21,00:36:30.21,">> I wanted to see where you stood, and I exactly found out."
586,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,">> Oh, really? >> The three of us are in an"
587,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,"alliance, so I don't understand why."
588,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,I haven't done anything to be disloyal to him.
589,00:36:38.88,00:36:38.88,I don't understand why he's testing me.
590,00:36:40.83,00:36:40.83,"I don't know. (voice breaking): Oh, my God."
591,00:36:51.04,00:36:51.04,(chuckles) >> PROBST: What are the tears
592,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,about right now? >> (sobbing): I'm just a
593,00:36:58.46,00:36:58.46,"frigging wreck! I'm so exhausted, and I'm just"
594,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,like... It's just too much for me
595,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"right now. Oh, man."
596,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,I just had a rough day. We've been in an alliance since
597,00:37:14.79,00:37:14.79,the beginning. I don't know why he's trying to
598,00:37:17.71,00:37:17.71,mess with it. >> PROBST: Is it feeling
599,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,personal to you? Is that hurting your feelings?
600,00:37:23.71,00:37:23.71,>> Yeah! >> I don't understand how she's
601,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,just putting it all on me. Why I'm trying to mess with it
602,00:37:29.33,00:37:29.33,when she agreed totally with that.
603,00:37:30.88,00:37:30.88,>> Because you were telling me she wanted to get me off.
604,00:37:33.08,00:37:33.08,"What am I supposed to say? >> And when she said, ""Let's"
605,00:37:35.38,00:37:35.38,"get rid of..."" Can I finish, please?"
606,00:37:38.71,00:37:38.71,>> No. >> Whatever.
607,00:37:40.42,00:37:40.42,>> You're such a liar. It wouldn't have happened.
608,00:37:42.58,00:37:42.58,It didn't. >> It would have happened if I
609,00:37:44.46,00:37:44.46,would have wanted it to happen. >> It would not have happened.
610,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,I'm closer to Parvati than you think.
611,00:37:49.67,00:37:49.67,">> Oh, really? >> Yeah, really."
612,00:37:53.50,00:37:53.50,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Boy, that perked"
613,00:37:56.12,00:37:56.12,you up. >> We're all fine right now.
614,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,There's no need for us to continue with this conversation.
615,00:38:02.54,00:38:02.54,"It's been resolved. At least, it was resolved today."
616,00:38:07.04,00:38:07.04,">> PROBST: Well, it just got reopened when you said you're"
617,00:38:09.75,00:38:09.75,closer to Parvati than Russell thinks.
618,00:38:11.38,00:38:11.38,">> No, he is underestimating, like, my friendship and my"
619,00:38:14.75,00:38:14.75,"loyalty to her, and I don't like that, so I'm just letting"
620,00:38:18.12,00:38:18.12,him know that I would never do that to her.
621,00:38:22.96,00:38:22.96,"PROBST: All right, then let's  get to the vote."
622,00:38:25.29,00:38:25.29,Russell has the immunity necklace.
623,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,You cannot vote for Russell. Everybody else is fair game.
624,00:38:30.25,00:38:30.25,"Danielle, you're up. >> Okay, second time's"
625,00:38:44.12,00:38:44.12,"the charm, right? Hopefully, you're going home"
626,00:38:45.75,00:38:45.75,home tonight. >> (whispers): You're closer to
627,00:38:58.04,00:38:58.04,Parvati than I think? That makes me think that y'all
628,00:39:01.67,00:39:01.67,"got something going on, so I'm gonna have to cut that tie."
629,00:39:17.25,00:39:17.25,">> I have absolutely no idea what just happened, but with"
630,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,"this vote, I'm sealing my fate. >> PROBST: I'll go"
631,00:39:31.12,00:39:31.12,tally the votes. If anybody has the
632,00:39:41.29,00:39:41.29,"hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be"
633,00:39:44.42,00:39:44.42,"the time to do so. All right, once the votes are"
634,00:39:51.04,00:39:51.04,"read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked"
635,00:39:53.58,00:39:53.58,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
636,00:39:55.12,00:39:55.12,I'll read the votes. First vote...
637,00:40:01.17,00:40:01.17,Rupert. Rupert.
638,00:40:06.92,00:40:06.92,Two votes Rupert. Rupert.
639,00:40:11.25,00:40:11.25,Three votes Rupert. Danielle.
640,00:40:16.04,00:40:16.04,"Three votes Rupert, one vote Danielle."
641,00:40:21.12,00:40:21.12,"Danielle. That's three votes Rupert,"
642,00:40:23.71,00:40:23.71,two votes Danielle. Danielle.
643,00:40:29.25,00:40:29.25,"We're tied. Three votes Danielle, three"
644,00:40:31.42,00:40:31.42,votes Rupert. One vote left.
645,00:40:35.50,00:40:35.50,14th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury:
646,00:40:43.96,00:40:43.96,Danielle. You need to bring me your torch.
647,00:40:58.92,00:40:58.92,"Danielle, the tribe has spoken. >> Bye."
648,00:41:13.75,00:41:13.75,>> PROBST: So here's what we learned tonight: the Villains
649,00:41:16.08,00:41:16.08,"are clearly not one big, happy family."
650,00:41:18.92,00:41:18.92,"Colby and Rupert live to see another day, and it is"
651,00:41:22.00,00:41:22.00,anybody's game. Grab your torches.
652,00:41:24.54,00:41:24.54,Head back to camp. Good night.
653,00:41:38.96,00:41:38.96,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
654,00:41:45.92,00:41:45.92,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
655,00:41:49.79,00:41:49.79,">> I'm against you, Russell. >> PROBST: Russell is on the"
656,00:41:52.08,00:41:52.08,outs with the Villains. (Parvati giggles)
657,00:41:55.96,00:41:55.96,So he tries to turn the Heroes to the dark side.
658,00:41:58.58,00:41:58.58,">> Greatest Villain, the greatest Hero."
659,00:42:00.38,00:42:00.38,I want to trust you all the way to the final three.
660,00:42:03.46,00:42:03.46,>> Final three. Final three. >> Russell is insane.
661,00:42:11.92,00:42:11.92,"And tonight, I might have put my own foot in my mouth at"
662,00:42:15.42,00:42:15.42,Tribal Council by basically just calling him out in front
663,00:42:18.33,00:42:18.33,of everybody. And I think he changed his vote
664,00:42:20.88,00:42:20.88,"the last minute, actually. I feel like I played a good"
665,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,game and maybe a little too aggressive this time.
666,00:42:26.12,00:42:26.12,But I did the best that I could and that's all you can ask.
