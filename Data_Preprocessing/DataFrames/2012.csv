192,00:12:15.08,00:12:15.08,Um...I'm nervous-- I can't read this
193,00:12:19.00,00:12:19.00,out here.I don't know where to put this.
194,00:12:21.67,00:12:21.67,"It's too big.Oh, no, it's too bulgy."
195,00:12:36.12,00:12:36.12,>> You think it's on thesetrails?
196,00:12:38.08,00:12:38.08,">> Well, I mean, these aren'treally trails, right?"
197,00:12:42.08,00:12:42.08,">> Even though I don't have theidol, maybe I can play like I"
198,00:12:46.12,00:12:46.12,"do.I stuck me a rock in my pocket,"
199,00:12:52.21,00:12:52.21,"making it look a little dangly,a little big."
200,00:12:55.71,00:12:55.71,This isn't my first game ofSurvivor.
201,00:12:58.12,00:12:58.12,I'm just trying to stay in itanother day.
202,00:13:04.17,00:13:04.17,">> What's happening, Rupe?Feel like we're Easter egg"
203,00:13:06.92,00:13:06.92,huntin'.>> Yeah.
204,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,>> I have a lot of experiencewith idols.
205,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,"Rupert has a big, bulky thingin his pocket."
206,00:13:18.00,00:13:18.00,It's the idol wrapped up in thepaper.
207,00:13:20.96,00:13:20.96,"Now, we have to get rid of theidol, so how are we going to do"
208,00:13:24.42,00:13:24.42,this?It's easy-- we'll split the
209,00:13:26.08,00:13:26.08,"votes tonight.If he don't play it, he goes"
210,00:13:28.71,00:13:28.71,home.That's how we'll do it.
211,00:13:30.54,00:13:30.54,">> I don't know, I thinkeverybody pretty much gave up."
212,00:13:33.04,00:13:33.04,>> He found it.I see it in his pocket.
213,00:13:35.25,00:13:35.25,I know exactly how they look.And I know exactly how they
214,00:13:37.83,00:13:37.83,look in a pocket.>> Russell swears that Rupert
215,00:13:44.50,00:13:44.50,"found the idol.Of course, I know that's a lie,"
216,00:13:47.29,00:13:47.29,'cause I have the freakin'immunity idol.
217,00:13:49.17,00:13:49.17,"And if they think Rupert hasit, that's good for Sandra."
218,00:13:52.92,00:13:52.92,"So I'm not going to say nothing.>> No, we'll split the votes,"
219,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,three-three.>> Why?
220,00:14:03.79,00:14:03.79,>> To get the idol out ofRupert's hands.
221,00:14:06.25,00:14:06.25,">> We have to flush it out.>> Oh, right."
222,00:14:08.12,00:14:08.12,>> So we have to split thevotes.
223,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,>> (whispers): It's perfect.>> Colby and Candice are both
224,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,threats in different ways.That's why it's a hard decision.
225,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,"Candice voted with us to voteout Amanda, and I really think"
226,00:14:28.96,00:14:28.96,she's going to stay loyal to us.Colby's not really doing any
227,00:14:31.79,00:14:31.79,"kind of strategizing, so I feellike I can get him to do"
228,00:14:35.58,00:14:35.58,"whatever.I don't know, I mean, either"
229,00:14:37.75,00:14:37.75,"way, we're rolling the dice.>> Right now we need to be safe"
230,00:14:41.25,00:14:41.25,and make sure that idol is outof Rupert's hands.
231,00:14:44.00,00:14:44.00,>> Yeah.>> Here's how it's gonna work.
232,00:14:48.71,00:14:48.71,"They're going to split thevotes tonight, 'cause they"
233,00:14:51.12,00:14:51.12,"got six of them, right?So they're going to send half"
234,00:14:53.75,00:14:53.75,"of them your way, and the otherhalf are either going to go"
235,00:14:56.17,00:14:56.17,towards me or towards Candice.>> If three of them vote for
236,00:14:58.92,00:14:58.92,"Candice, then you and I votefor Candice, there's five votes"
237,00:15:01.29,00:15:01.29,for Candice.>> And even if three of them
238,00:15:04.12,00:15:04.12,"vote for you and you don't havethe idol, you're still safe."
239,00:15:06.67,00:15:06.67,>> There's still five votes forCandice.
240,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,>> Exactly. I could be goinghome tonight if it doesn't
241,00:15:11.21,00:15:11.21,"work, but if it does, me andyou get to vote Candice out."
242,00:15:13.96,00:15:13.96,">> Oh, God! That would be...>> And then we've still got a"
243,00:15:17.75,00:15:17.75,shot.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
244,00:15:31.00,00:15:31.00,the members of our jury.Coach... Courtney...
245,00:15:36.04,00:15:36.04,"J.T., and Amanda, voted out atthe last Tribal Council."
246,00:15:42.33,00:15:42.33,"All right, Rupert, let's pickup with the last Tribal Council."
247,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,Amanda's voted out.You all go back to camp.
248,00:15:48.17,00:15:48.17,"What's the fallout?>> The fallout was, we realized"
249,00:15:51.42,00:15:51.42,there's only two Heroes left.There's Colby and I.
250,00:15:55.38,00:15:55.38,Candice jumped to the Villains'side.
251,00:15:57.79,00:15:57.79,">> PROBST: Candice, you'reshaking your head."
252,00:15:59.50,00:15:59.50,Is that not true?>> It was obvious that Amanda
253,00:16:02.92,00:16:02.92,was going to go home whether Ivoted for her or not.
254,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,"You know, Amanda had a targeton her back because she's a"
255,00:16:08.75,00:16:08.75,"strong, strategic player.So it wasn't like my vote was"
256,00:16:12.04,00:16:12.04,the nail in the coffin to sendher home.
257,00:16:14.58,00:16:14.58,The numbers were already there.>> I have no respect for the
258,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,excuses.>> It's not going to get me any
259,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,further in the game to go downon a sinking ship.
260,00:16:22.46,00:16:22.46,">> Well, then that's what youshould have said, that right"
261,00:16:24.38,00:16:24.38,there.>> Exactly right.
262,00:16:26.33,00:16:26.33,">> ""This is a game for amillion dollars."
263,00:16:28.58,00:16:28.58,"This was my best play."">> PROBST: So, Russell, as a"
264,00:16:32.08,00:16:32.08,"strategy, Candice put herselfahead of Colby and Rupert, and"
265,00:16:35.12,00:16:35.12,that will keep her in the gamelonger.
266,00:16:37.42,00:16:37.42,"Good move.>> Yeah, it's her best move."
267,00:16:40.67,00:16:40.67,"She goes to the Villains' sideat number six, and unless"
268,00:16:44.46,00:16:44.46,"you're going to give all theVillains a million dollars,"
269,00:16:46.71,00:16:46.71,something has to break withinthe Villains-- so she could have
270,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,made a great move.>> PROBST: So if history
271,00:16:52.58,00:16:52.58,"repeats, now we're looking atRupert or Colby in trouble"
272,00:16:57.12,00:16:57.12,tonight.>> What am I supposed to say?
273,00:16:59.17,00:16:59.17,I'm going to get rid of myVillain partners out here?
274,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,"No, that ain't gonna happen.We got two Heroes that's gonna"
275,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"have to go sooner or later, andthe consensus is that Rupert"
276,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"goes, so...>> PROBST: Rupert, after the"
277,00:17:11.92,00:17:11.92,"challenge was over, I read aclue where another idol was"
278,00:17:15.71,00:17:15.71,hidden.You get back to camp-- what
279,00:17:17.67,00:17:17.67,happens?>> We got home from our
280,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,challenge.I calmly took my sandals off and
281,00:17:23.08,00:17:23.08,went for a walk in the jungleand stayed until I felt
282,00:17:27.42,00:17:27.42,"comfortable.>> PROBST: So, Russell, you"
283,00:17:29.54,00:17:29.54,"think that idol's out there, ordo you think Colby or Rupert has"
284,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,"the idol?>> If they don't, then they"
285,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,gave up.And I don't think Colby or
286,00:17:39.96,00:17:39.96,"Rupert would give up.>> PROBST: All right, let's get"
287,00:17:44.88,00:17:44.88,to the vote.Parvati has the immunity
288,00:17:46.62,00:17:46.62,necklace.Cannot vote for Parvati.
289,00:17:48.04,00:17:48.04,"Everybody else is fair game.Colby, you're up."
290,00:17:56.83,00:17:56.83,>> I can honestly say I'm proudof the way I played this game.
291,00:18:01.25,00:18:01.25,"Can you?>> My mom always told me, if you"
292,00:18:19.38,00:18:19.38,"don't have something nice tosay, don't say anything at all."
293,00:18:43.88,00:18:43.88,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.

295,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,"play it, now would be the timeto do so."
296,00:19:21.08,00:19:21.08,"Okay, once the votes are read,the decision is final."
297,00:19:23.79,00:19:23.79,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal

314,00:20:53.04,00:20:53.04,"Good luck, you guys.>> PROBST: Time for you to go."
315,00:21:01.29,00:21:01.29,"Well, maybe the lesson learnedfrom tonight's Tribal Council is"
316,00:21:04.96,00:21:04.96,this-- it's a risky move whenyou betray trust in order to
317,00:21:09.33,00:21:09.33,gain trust.Grab your torches.
318,00:21:11.79,00:21:11.79,Head back to camp.Good night.
319,00:21:19.62,00:21:19.62,">> I definitely got thrown underthe bus tonight, um, but I"

325,00:21:55.62,00:21:55.62,It was a terrible decision.The girls got their heart
326,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,"involved in the game, wantedCandice out of here because"
327,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,"they didn't like her, soeverybody blew it."
328,00:22:04.21,00:22:04.21,And I'm one of them.I should have sat them down and

609,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,I'm closer to Parvati thanyou think.
