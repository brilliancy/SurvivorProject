207,00:09:50.10,00:09:50.10,and I had a little stainin my underwear.
208,00:09:53.03,00:09:53.03,- You can't embarrass him.He doesn't give a hoot.
209,00:09:56.43,00:09:56.43,"He just doesn't care, so Ican't give you an answer"
210,00:09:58.90,00:09:58.90,because I don't think Tomhas ever been embarrassed.
211,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30,"- All right, Kim."
212,00:10:03.73,00:10:03.73,- I kept falling offmy bike in a race.
213,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,I was doing a triathlon
214,00:10:07.27,00:10:07.27,and my bathing suit gotcaught in my bike seat
215,00:10:09.73,00:10:09.73,as I tried topick my bike up.
216,00:10:10.97,00:10:10.97,All the other racersgot a really good view.
217,00:10:13.30,00:10:13.30,- Her most embarrassing momentwas when she wiped out
218,00:10:15.40,00:10:15.40,during a triathlon.
219,00:10:16.90,00:10:16.90,"- Yes, Mom, yes!"
220,00:10:18.60,00:10:18.60,- Couldn't gether bike turned around
221,00:10:20.07,00:10:20.07,and her bathing suiteven got stuck in her bike.
222,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,"- All right!Yes, Mom!"
223,00:10:23.40,00:10:23.40,Yes!- Good job!
224,00:10:27.20,00:10:27.20,"- All right, Lex, mostembarrassing moment."
225,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,"- Back in college, I used to goto a lot of happy hours."
226,00:10:31.03,00:10:31.03,"One time, I got a little toohappy."
227,00:10:32.67,00:10:32.67,I threw up in the middle of myhuman sexuality class.
228,00:10:36.50,00:10:36.50,- That would be in collegewhen he threw up
229,00:10:39.07,00:10:39.07,all over the otherstudents.
230,00:10:40.70,00:10:40.70,- Yes.- There it is.
231,00:10:43.17,00:10:43.17,- That's my wife.Love her.
232,00:10:45.43,00:10:45.43,"- Okay, after the firstround,"
233,00:10:46.50,00:10:46.50,"Lex and Kim Powers,up one and one."
234,00:10:50.90,00:10:50.90,- Next question--what physical trait
235,00:10:53.47,00:10:53.47,do you least likeabout yourself?
236,00:10:56.13,00:10:56.13,- I think he'll say my feet.
237,00:10:58.07,00:10:58.07,"- It will be her feet.- Oh, baby."
238,00:11:02.67,00:11:02.67,"- I have straight,stringy see-through hair."
239,00:11:05.33,00:11:05.33,- I would have to say thatwould be her nose.
240,00:11:07.57,00:11:07.57,- Baby!
241,00:11:10.37,00:11:10.37,"- Well, I hate to admit it,"
242,00:11:11.57,00:11:11.57,"but this is my familyanswering for me,"
243,00:11:13.10,00:11:13.10,and they probably thinkI said I have none.
244,00:11:15.40,00:11:15.40,- Your legs.- What?
245,00:11:19.33,00:11:19.33,- I'm going to say hairbecause I would love this--
246,00:11:22.17,00:11:22.17,"if I could grow it over,I'd have it down to my feet."
247,00:11:25.03,00:11:25.03,- He used to say he was a heckof a man when he had hair.
248,00:11:27.73,00:11:27.73,"So, lack of hair.- Good job, Big Tom."
249,00:11:30.70,00:11:30.70,"- Could have gone two ways, butI'm going to say small chest."
250,00:11:32.90,00:11:32.90,- It's her arms.
251,00:11:34.60,00:11:34.60,"- Oh, God, Mom,where did you get that?"
252,00:11:37.33,00:11:37.33,"- My nose.- The hair on his back, sorry."
253,00:11:41.03,00:11:41.03,- What?
254,00:11:43.80,00:11:43.80,You can take a look-- I thinkI got about six of them.
255,00:11:46.07,00:11:46.07,"- All right, after tworounds, here is where we are at."
256,00:11:48.37,00:11:48.37,Kim Johnson has one.Big Tom has one.
257,00:11:51.00,00:11:51.00,"Young Kim has one,and Lex has one."
258,00:11:53.47,00:11:53.47,"Teresa and Ethan, you guys gotto get on the board."
259,00:11:55.30,00:11:55.30,Here's the third question.
260,00:11:56.70,00:11:56.70,What will your family memberssay is your biggest fear?
261,00:11:59.37,00:11:59.37,Biggest fear?
262,00:12:00.87,00:12:00.87,- Growing old and not beingable to do what I want to do.
263,00:12:03.80,00:12:03.80,"- She is really prettyfearless,"
264,00:12:05.80,00:12:05.80,but she is scaredof bungee jumping.
265,00:12:07.60,00:12:07.60,- Wrong track.
266,00:12:09.97,00:12:09.97,- My greatest fearand probably only fear
267,00:12:12.00,00:12:12.00,is loss of a loved one.
268,00:12:13.77,00:12:13.77,- Only one I can think ofis maybe snakes.
269,00:12:16.00,00:12:16.00,- Snakes?
270,00:12:17.83,00:12:17.83,- I think it's a fear ofthrowing up.
271,00:12:21.10,00:12:21.10,- Vomiting.
272,00:12:22.43,00:12:22.43,- Yeah!

275,00:12:28.60,00:12:28.60,- She will say none.
276,00:12:30.73,00:12:30.73,- It's alwaysin every parent's mind
277,00:12:33.07,00:12:33.07,"about their children,so his biggest fear"
278,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40,would be that somethingwould happen to his son.
279,00:12:38.53,00:12:38.53,"- Hard to argue with that.- Yes, it is."
280,00:12:41.23,00:12:41.23,- She's got to get this one--spiders.
281,00:12:43.67,00:12:43.67,- Her biggest fear is beingunfulfilled.
282,00:12:46.27,00:12:46.27,"- Oh, my God.Are you kidding me?"
283,00:12:48.13,00:12:48.13,"- Wow, that's deep.- Lex."

287,00:12:54.97,00:12:54.97,"- That'll work.- Thanks, honey."
288,00:12:56.77,00:12:56.77,"- Okay, Lex is in the leadwith two."
289,00:12:59.30,00:12:59.30,"Kim Johnson, Kim Powers, Ethanand Tom each have one."
290,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,"Teresa, this is the lastquestion."
291,00:13:05.97,00:13:05.97,"Since there is no wayyou can win,"
292,00:13:07.43,00:13:07.43,we'll leave you out ofthis one.
293,00:13:09.60,00:13:09.60,What is your greatestachievement?
294,00:13:11.87,00:13:11.87,- I said my family.
295,00:13:13.53,00:13:13.53,"I've been married veryhappily for 37 years,"

297,00:13:17.50,00:13:17.50,"And not having any familyof my own before that,"
298,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23,it just doesn'tget any better than this.
299,00:13:22.00,00:13:22.00,"- I think her answer would bea really great family,"
300,00:13:26.20,00:13:26.20,three great kids.
301,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,- Very nice.- Three grandchildren.

311,00:13:52.40,00:13:52.40,- My son.You don't have to play it.
312,00:13:56.17,00:13:56.17,She knows that is my greatestaccomplishment.
313,00:13:58.80,00:13:58.80,"- Tom's greatest achievementwould be his son, Beau."
314,00:14:02.23,00:14:02.23,- Yeah!

347,00:15:38.90,00:15:38.90,If anyone should see somethingcompletely different
348,00:15:43.10,00:15:43.10,"and reallyexperience Africa,"
349,00:15:44.40,00:15:44.40,I thought Tomwas really kind of deserving.

351,00:15:54.13,00:15:54.13,to a place calledGovernor's Camp.

373,00:17:10.23,00:17:10.23,- I don't think we would bewell advised
374,00:17:12.47,00:17:12.47,to describe this place inall its detail and glory
375,00:17:16.73,00:17:16.73,"to everyone else in thetribe,"
376,00:17:18.03,00:17:18.03,because I think theymight just kill us and bury us.

409,00:18:54.50,00:18:54.50,and knocking each otherto the ground.
410,00:18:55.80,00:18:55.80,It's a cluster.
411,00:18:57.23,00:18:57.23,It is the damnedest thingyou've ever seen.
412,00:18:58.83,00:18:58.83,(grumbling moans and calls)
413,00:19:02.27,00:19:02.27,(imitating calls)
414,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67,They sound like me on a goodSaturday night when I get home.
415,00:19:08.90,00:19:08.90,- Two million head of animalmoving at the same time.
416,00:19:12.33,00:19:12.33,Two million headof wild animal.
417,00:19:15.20,00:19:15.20,The safari was amazing.

420,00:19:22.70,00:19:22.70,and I'm seeing it all inthe space of an hour.
421,00:19:25.50,00:19:25.50,"- We are amongst them,ain't we?"
422,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,"Look at him, look at him.There, mate."

428,00:19:40.97,00:19:40.97,(laughter)
429,00:19:42.20,00:19:42.20,- He thought he was doingsomething for us.
430,00:19:45.70,00:19:45.70,He really thinks he isdoing something.
431,00:19:59.37,00:19:59.37,"- When we came back from thesafari, we were just bubbling."
432,00:20:03.23,00:20:03.23,"- What is this right here,Tommy?"
433,00:20:05.50,00:20:05.50,"- All of a sudden, I looked upthere on the side of the river"
434,00:20:09.13,00:20:09.13,"and I seen two chairs and atable and on that table,"
435,00:20:12.30,00:20:12.30,it hada few spirits on there.
436,00:20:14.63,00:20:14.63,"So I told Lex, I said,"
437,00:20:16.80,00:20:16.80,looks like we might ought tohave a toast.
438,00:20:19.13,00:20:19.13,- Thank you for today.- Thank you for coming.
439,00:20:29.40,00:20:29.40,- (gibberish)God-- holy.

441,00:20:35.63,00:20:35.63,now and again at home.
442,00:20:37.30,00:20:37.30,So our first thought comingback was I would kill somebody
443,00:20:39.27,00:20:39.27,to geta nice cold beer in me.
444,00:20:40.70,00:20:40.70,"This place is wonderful becauseif you want something,"
445,00:20:45.37,00:20:45.37,there issomebody right there.
446,00:20:46.37,00:20:46.37,They can almostread your mind.
447,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47,To the game.
448,00:20:53.53,00:20:53.53,I've never drank beerwith a mustache before.
449,00:20:55.77,00:20:55.77,- I never drunk beer with ahippo before.
450,00:20:58.73,00:20:58.73,(laughing)
451,00:21:01.53,00:21:01.53,"- When the dinner bell rang,"
452,00:21:02.97,00:21:02.97,Tom wasn't quite done withhis bottle of bourbon.
453,00:21:05.27,00:21:05.27,"Tom is definitely not one towaste anything,"
454,00:21:07.67,00:21:07.67,so he took hisbottle with.
455,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,"In fact,it was in his pocket."
456,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,"- You had a good safari?- Oh, beautiful, thank you."
457,00:21:16.37,00:21:16.37,- Thank you.

462,00:21:33.40,00:21:33.40,"- They brought me a pieceof lamb this big around,"
463,00:21:36.87,00:21:36.87,and I'm a meat eater.
464,00:21:38.37,00:21:38.37,"I mean, that salad stuff,"
465,00:21:39.83,00:21:39.83,"it's not for women orsomething, but I like meat."
466,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,It was absolutelymelting in my mouth.
467,00:21:45.30,00:21:45.30,"- Frances, it's beautiful.Thank you."
468,00:21:47.03,00:21:47.03,"- You the man, Fran!"

471,00:21:59.00,00:21:59.00,"- Good, because I'mgoing to imagine"
472,00:22:01.73,00:22:01.73,this tasteslike mashed potatoes.
473,00:22:06.70,00:22:06.70,- Maybe not.- No.
474,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,It's not working.Still tastes like corn mush.
475,00:22:12.03,00:22:12.03,- I don't everwant to eat corn again.
476,00:22:14.23,00:22:14.23,"Not a corn tortilla, not cornflakes, not corn chowder,"
477,00:22:21.63,00:22:21.63,"not corn in the can,not cream corn,"

482,00:22:37.63,00:22:37.63,"- Listen to that thunder.- It's raining, all right."
483,00:22:40.80,00:22:40.80,- There has not beena drop of rain hit my ass
484,00:22:43.60,00:22:43.60,in 40 days and 40 nights.
485,00:22:46.07,00:22:46.07,I want to get up there andput myself in it.
486,00:22:48.77,00:22:48.77,"- When we gotback from dinner,"
487,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,Tom decided to promptly helphimself
488,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,to as much of thebourbon as possible.
489,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,- You want to see a rabbitpulled out of a hat?
490,00:22:58.60,00:22:58.60,- (laughing)
491,00:23:00.93,00:23:00.93,"I know he wasliquored and loaded,"
492,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,but it just made thewhole night that much funnier.
493,00:23:07.30,00:23:07.30,"- Lex, I'm gladyou picked me."
494,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,"- I'm gladI picked you, too."
495,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,- You'd probably have beenbored with somebody else.
496,00:23:13.50,00:23:13.50,You knew you...
497,00:23:14.90,00:23:14.90,"Here, you probablyone of the best ones."
498,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,"Hey, bartender,fix me a toddy."
499,00:23:21.20,00:23:21.20,"Oh, Big Tom will loveeverybody."

516,00:24:19.57,00:24:19.57,"- This morningwhen I woke up,"
517,00:24:21.40,00:24:21.40,"my head, it wouldn't havefit in a wash tub."
518,00:24:25.00,00:24:25.00,"I said, where am I?I had to look around."
519,00:24:27.27,00:24:27.27,I was in a bed.
520,00:24:28.63,00:24:28.63,- We are just waking up early
521,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,because we got an earlymorning wake-up call
522,00:24:31.60,00:24:31.60,for balloon ride time.
523,00:24:34.97,00:24:34.97,- I drunk a glass of water andeat four or five cookies.
524,00:24:38.93,00:24:38.93,"Well, it was on again--I just got tanked back up."
525,00:24:42.97,00:24:42.97,Woo!

530,00:24:58.10,00:24:58.10,and it would shoot a flame likea dragon up in there.
531,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,(whooshing)
532,00:25:01.40,00:25:01.40,"And when he did,here we go."
533,00:25:05.03,00:25:05.03,Goodness gracious.Holy moley.
534,00:25:11.20,00:25:11.20,I was almostthis high last night.
535,00:25:13.50,00:25:13.50,- I think you were higher.
536,00:25:17.93,00:25:17.93,"- This guy, Rob,he is from England."
537,00:25:21.60,00:25:21.60,"Every time we gettalking to him,"
538,00:25:23.27,00:25:23.27,"the thing would keep goingdown, down."
539,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,I could see a treein front of us.
540,00:25:28.47,00:25:28.47,"Oh, my gosh, I'd kind of shout,and he'd say, oh, and then..."
541,00:25:34.83,00:25:34.83,- That's pretty good.
542,00:25:37.30,00:25:37.30,"- Well, crikey,after 30 years,"
543,00:25:39.27,00:25:39.27,"if I can't get it rightby now, I never will."
544,00:25:40.97,00:25:40.97,- Yeah.
545,00:25:54.60,00:25:54.60,"- 30 years,you ever had to crash?"
546,00:25:57.07,00:25:57.07,- Balloons arewonderfully safe.
547,00:25:58.87,00:25:58.87,The most dangerous thingabout ballooning
548,00:26:00.33,00:26:00.33,is actually spillingthe champagne when you land.
549,00:26:08.17,00:26:08.17,- Look at the hyena.- He lives there.
550,00:26:11.10,00:26:11.10,- See him.Look at him run.
551,00:26:13.43,00:26:13.43,"Big Tom, look at that.This is the way to see it."
552,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40,Looking straight downinto the jungle
553,00:26:19.93,00:26:19.93,looking straight onoverhead on wildlife.
554,00:26:23.17,00:26:23.17,"We are just whiskingthrough the stuff,"
555,00:26:25.10,00:26:25.10,"you know, while the sunis coming up."
556,00:26:26.40,00:26:26.40,It was amazing.
557,00:26:28.43,00:26:28.43,It was--leaves you breathless.
558,00:26:33.40,00:26:33.40,Look at the littlehippo over there.
559,00:26:35.20,00:26:35.20,"- They spend all nighteating grass,"
560,00:26:38.13,00:26:38.13,then they spend all day inthe river getting rid of it.
561,00:26:43.03,00:26:43.03,"- Considering where we've been,just to see the green,"
562,00:26:45.70,00:26:45.70,it makes you appreciateit so much more.
563,00:26:48.27,00:26:48.27,I hate to even blink.
564,00:26:49.67,00:26:49.67,I'm afraidI'll miss something.
565,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,- There arewildebeest below us.
566,00:26:52.80,00:26:52.80,- I see two wildebeestsjust bombing along.
567,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,"I said,""Lex, ain't that funny?"""
568,00:26:57.40,00:26:57.40,"I said, ""All them wildebeestswe've seen-- these two"
569,00:27:00.23,00:27:00.23,"are down here next tothe river by themselves."""
570,00:27:02.90,00:27:02.90,"I said, ""If I was a lion, I'dpick that little one out."
571,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73,"It'd be a good meal."""
572,00:27:07.10,00:27:07.10,I had no longer said that
573,00:27:08.83,00:27:08.83,"than all of a sudden,a lion popped up."
574,00:27:11.30,00:27:11.30,"- Look, look, look!A lion!"
575,00:27:12.60,00:27:12.60,Look at that.Look at that.
576,00:27:14.27,00:27:14.27,"Oh, my God."
577,00:27:21.07,00:27:21.07,"- All of a sudden that lionkind of gives up and I said,"
578,00:27:23.43,00:27:23.43,"""Well, the wildebeesthas won."""
579,00:27:25.33,00:27:25.33,"About that time, here poppedanother one up."
580,00:27:28.53,00:27:28.53,That lion had ran the wildebeestinto the other one.
581,00:27:31.60,00:27:31.60,"- Wow!Oh, my God."
582,00:27:35.90,00:27:35.90,- Now can you believe that?- Unbelievable.
583,00:27:38.77,00:27:38.77,Nice. Got it!
584,00:27:44.77,00:27:44.77,Just like he said.Death by asphyxiation.
585,00:27:48.63,00:27:48.63,He's just holding his mouth ontop of that wildebeest there.
586,00:27:52.03,00:27:52.03,"Where there were twowildebeest, now there's one."
587,00:27:55.63,00:27:55.63,That was a treat.- Fantastic.
588,00:27:57.20,00:27:57.20,That is rare.That is rare.
589,00:27:58.87,00:27:58.87,- That was cool.
590,00:28:02.30,00:28:02.30,- My mind has been a prettylittle old tight thing.
591,00:28:05.00,00:28:05.00,It has not beenexpanded very much.
592,00:28:06.93,00:28:06.93,But this whole thingjust gave me new life.
593,00:28:10.20,00:28:10.20,"At 45, I thought I haddone some things"
594,00:28:13.00,00:28:13.00,and I found out I ain'tdone diddly.
595,00:28:15.60,00:28:15.60,This just shows methat there is more to life
596,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,than just what isaround the corner at the house.
597,00:28:25.60,00:28:25.60,- Going back to camp at thispoint is going to be miserable.
598,00:28:28.60,00:28:28.60,"I mean, I'm feelingsick about it."
599,00:28:30.07,00:28:30.07,- The same seats have beenreserved for you.
600,00:28:31.77,00:28:31.77,"- Oh, thank you much."
601,00:28:33.30,00:28:33.30,- Going back to camp now meansgoing back to the game.
602,00:28:36.97,00:28:36.97,"I'm going to bethe last person standing,"
603,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,"so, in the next coupleof hours,"
604,00:28:39.80,00:28:39.80,"I'll have to be on mygame again,"
605,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,as much as it pains meto admit it.
606,00:28:47.87,00:28:47.87,"- If you don't have any ofthose cards,"
607,00:28:49.73,00:28:49.73,you can change itwith an eight

753,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,we could get Lex off.
754,00:36:18.77,00:36:18.77,This is the time you got tostart thinking who do you want
755,00:36:20.70,00:36:20.70,to go to the end withand who do you want off?
756,00:36:23.53,00:36:23.53,I thinkI'll vote for Lex next.

764,00:36:49.03,00:36:49.03,Lex recruited Brandonto save him.
765,00:36:52.93,00:36:52.93,I felt like Lex betrayed me.
766,00:36:56.17,00:36:56.17,He knowsmy feelings on that.

774,00:37:39.27,00:37:39.27,There is no way I can repay Lexfor the taking me along.
775,00:37:43.53,00:37:43.53,"I mean,if I live to be 100,"
776,00:37:45.13,00:37:45.13,thank youdon't go far enough.

790,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50,"- So with the exceptionof Big Tom,"
791,00:38:16.30,00:38:16.30,"a lot of it is family,loved ones."
792,00:38:18.87,00:38:18.87,Are they going to be proud ofhow you played the game so far?
793,00:38:22.30,00:38:22.30,"How aboutfor you, Kim Powers?"
794,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,"- I've never even campedbefore,"
795,00:38:24.87,00:38:24.87,so I think they'll bepretty proud
796,00:38:26.60,00:38:26.60,that I actually made it33 days sleeping outside.
797,00:38:29.07,00:38:29.07,"- Big Tom, are you proud withhow you played the game?"
798,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,- Maybe.
799,00:38:35.50,00:38:35.50,Maybe me and Lexhad a moment or two.
800,00:38:38.20,00:38:38.20,"I might cringe a little,"
801,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,but I don't rememberthat much about it.
802,00:38:41.80,00:38:41.80,"Other than that, I have--I hold my head up."
803,00:38:46.10,00:38:46.10,I have no regrets.
804,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"- How about you,Teresa?"
805,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,- Probably wouldn't havestarted out
806,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,building such analliance when I started.
807,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,"I think that caused a lot offriction with our tribe,"
808,00:38:56.93,00:38:56.93,so I wouldn't havestarted out that way.
