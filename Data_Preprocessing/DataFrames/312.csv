3,00:00:02.97,00:00:02.97,The members of Moto Maji were weak and hungry.

7,00:00:11.87,00:00:11.87,"but he gave his word to us, also."
8,00:00:14.17,00:00:14.17,He kind of went out on his own and covered his own ass.
9,00:00:16.53,00:00:16.53,"- From here on out, I have a question with Lex."
10,00:00:20.10,00:00:20.10,- But Lex guaranteed himself
11,00:00:21.33,00:00:21.33,three more days by winning immunity.
12,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67,Lex wins immunity.

15,00:00:28.17,00:00:28.17,a little too bluntly.

17,00:00:31.30,00:00:31.30,"that the media give open market to,"
18,00:00:33.13,00:00:33.13,instead of the average working-class American
19,00:00:35.13,00:00:35.13,that founded this country...
20,00:00:36.13,00:00:36.13,"- Okay, enough! All right, enough."
21,00:00:37.47,00:00:37.47,- Today is Tribal Council day.
22,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,You don't want to really ruffle any feathers.
23,00:00:41.10,00:00:41.10,"- At Tribal Council, Frank paid for his opinions."
24,00:00:43.67,00:00:43.67,Even Teresa voted against him.
25,00:00:45.80,00:00:45.80,Only six remain.
26,00:00:47.67,00:00:47.67,"Tonight, the stakes grow higher"
27,00:00:49.37,00:00:49.37,as one more is voted out of the tribe.

32,00:02:11.60,00:02:11.60,- I made that. That slip was through.
33,00:02:15.93,00:02:15.93,"It was all, like, strategically kind of placed."
34,00:02:18.27,00:02:18.27,"- I'm surrounded by people I enjoy, but yet I'm so alone."
35,00:02:21.30,00:02:21.30,"You are so alone, because they are your friends, but, you know,"
36,00:02:24.77,00:02:24.77,I only met them a month ago.
37,00:02:26.27,00:02:26.27,- As tight as you can on it.
38,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,"- You know, I hold back a lot."
39,00:02:29.23,00:02:29.23,"You know, I don't reveal everything about myself."
40,00:02:32.37,00:02:32.37,"Even though I'm surrounded by people all the time,"
41,00:02:34.73,00:02:34.73,I still feel so alone.
42,00:02:38.07,00:02:38.07,"- You've got mail. - Oh, a diary."
43,00:02:43.30,00:02:43.30,"- This could be huge, guys. - All right."
44,00:02:46.80,00:02:46.80,"- All right, and it reads, ""You think you know them"
45,00:02:53.77,00:02:53.77,"""and that they know you."
46,00:02:58.50,00:02:58.50,"""It's time to find out if that really is true."
47,00:03:04.63,00:03:04.63,"""For the winner, a prize that takes you away,"
48,00:03:11.77,00:03:11.77,"but that is just the beginning of an unforgettable day."""
49,00:03:18.77,00:03:18.77,- Cool!
50,00:03:20.60,00:03:20.60,"- I think it's a fair guess that, um,"
51,00:03:22.73,00:03:22.73,"this challenge is early, because, we..."
52,00:03:24.67,00:03:24.67,whoever wins is going on a trip today.
53,00:03:26.60,00:03:26.60,"- Oh, God."
54,00:03:40.30,00:03:40.30,"- Well, seeing as how you guys have been away"
55,00:03:42.80,00:03:42.80,"for over a month, I figure you got to be"
56,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50,missing the loved ones a little bit.
57,00:03:47.50,00:03:47.50,So I called them up and asked them
58,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,to put together a little greeting.
59,00:03:51.07,00:03:51.07,"- Oh, my God. - Which may also help you"
60,00:03:52.73,00:03:52.73,to get to know your tribe mates a little better.
61,00:03:54.63,00:03:54.63,"Miss Johnson, you're up first."
62,00:03:57.47,00:03:57.47,- We have two pieces of news-- good news and bad news.
63,00:04:00.47,00:04:00.47,"The good news is, we're still getting married."
64,00:04:01.80,00:04:01.80,The invitations are going out.
65,00:04:02.83,00:04:02.83,The bad news is that you are not here
66,00:04:04.43,00:04:04.43,and that we miss you dearly.
67,00:04:05.93,00:04:05.93,"- Hi, Kippy. - I miss you, Mom."
68,00:04:09.73,00:04:09.73,- Hope you are doing okay.
69,00:04:11.47,00:04:11.47,- It's tough surviving around here without you.
70,00:04:13.63,00:04:13.63,"Love you, and we hope above all, you are having a ball."
71,00:04:18.03,00:04:18.03,See you soon.
72,00:04:20.47,00:04:20.47,- Isn't he so cool? Thank you.
73,00:04:23.87,00:04:23.87,- Does something like that give you the strength
74,00:04:25.73,00:04:25.73,"to go on or make you think, ""I got to get home""?"
75,00:04:28.10,00:04:28.10,"- I think they are rooting for me so much,"
76,00:04:30.00,00:04:30.00,"and we're so close to the end now,"
77,00:04:31.73,00:04:31.73,that it does give me the strength to go on.
78,00:04:34.10,00:04:34.10,"- All right, Miss Cooper. - Oh, God."
79,00:04:36.63,00:04:36.63,"- Hi, Teresa, you remember us?"
80,00:04:38.70,00:04:38.70,"We are your family in Jackson, Georgia."
81,00:04:40.33,00:04:40.33,We miss you.
82,00:04:41.33,00:04:41.33,- I been marking off my calendar.
83,00:04:43.53,00:04:43.53,Mommy and I are praying for you.
84,00:04:44.93,00:04:44.93,"I miss you. - I miss you, too, baby."
85,00:04:46.43,00:04:46.43,- I've been marking off my calendar
86,00:04:48.13,00:04:48.13,and I've been sleeping with my monkey bed.
87,00:04:51.07,00:04:51.07,And I love you. That's all I wanted to say.
88,00:04:53.67,00:04:53.67,"- Hi, T-Bird! - Hey, Daddy."
89,00:04:56.23,00:04:56.23,"- I love you, honey-- do good."

96,00:05:08.30,00:05:08.30,"- Your turn. - Hi, Ethan, honey."
97,00:05:12.17,00:05:12.17,"We just finished eating dinner,"
98,00:05:13.70,00:05:13.70,and we are having a little trouble.

102,00:05:25.37,00:05:25.37,- We like having a one-way conversation with you
103,00:05:27.47,00:05:27.47,"when you can't talk back,"
104,00:05:28.83,00:05:28.83,"and we love you and good luck, kid."
105,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,"- Oh, that's so cool."
106,00:05:34.70,00:05:34.70,"- Big Tom, you are up, fellow."
107,00:05:37.27,00:05:37.27,- Goat's about to eat us up here on the golf cart.
108,00:05:40.20,00:05:40.20,We are taking care of them.
109,00:05:41.60,00:05:41.60,"I bet the big guy's been playing a little golf,"
110,00:05:45.40,00:05:45.40,chasing a little beaver.
111,00:05:46.97,00:05:46.97,"You know, same old stuff. Over and out, big guy."
112,00:05:49.73,00:05:49.73,Kick some ass.
113,00:05:51.67,00:05:51.67,"- Hey, Tom, I sure do miss you around here."
114,00:05:54.57,00:05:54.57,"Had a lot of time, so I've been riding this old stud here"
115,00:05:58.77,00:05:58.77,since I don't have one at home.
116,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,We do miss you and everything is going fine.
117,00:06:02.53,00:06:02.53,We look forward to having you back.
118,00:06:05.10,00:06:05.10,I love you and we'll see you later.
119,00:06:06.53,00:06:06.53,Bye-bye.
120,00:06:08.87,00:06:08.87,"- See, they don't have any more control over the goats"
121,00:06:11.07,00:06:11.07,than you did.
122,00:06:12.40,00:06:12.40,(laughter)
123,00:06:13.73,00:06:13.73,"- All right, Powers."
124,00:06:16.40,00:06:16.40,- I miss you more every day.
125,00:06:18.37,00:06:18.37,"- Oh, my God."
126,00:06:19.70,00:06:19.70,- Sometimes I just have to call your voice mail
127,00:06:22.03,00:06:22.03,so I can hear your voice.
128,00:06:24.27,00:06:24.27,"I know that you are fine, and I know you are doing real well."
129,00:06:30.07,00:06:30.07,Love you lots. Have fun.
130,00:06:33.03,00:06:33.03,Enjoy. Remember how much I love you.
131,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,- Nice.
132,00:06:39.67,00:06:39.67,- You can tell as your mom--
133,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,"the reason it stops and starts,"
134,00:06:43.53,00:06:43.53,she couldn't stop crying either.
135,00:06:46.20,00:06:46.20,"She didn't want anyone to see her crying,"
136,00:06:47.77,00:06:47.77,so she kept stopping the tape.
137,00:06:49.27,00:06:49.27,"- Obviously, I take after her."
138,00:06:52.67,00:06:52.67,- Are you okay? You are shaking.
139,00:06:54.57,00:06:54.57,- I'm good. - It's a good shake.
140,00:06:56.40,00:06:56.40,"- Yeah, it's a good shake. It's good."

145,00:07:03.87,00:07:03.87,- I love you so much-- I love you more than...

147,00:07:11.13,00:07:11.13,- I miss you and I love you very much.
148,00:07:16.00,00:07:16.00,"- Hi, honey-- the minute I saw you, I fell in love with you."
149,00:07:20.00,00:07:20.00,I can't wait to see you again
150,00:07:21.77,00:07:21.77,"and give you a big hug and kiss you and, you know."
151,00:07:25.60,00:07:25.60,(laughter)
152,00:07:26.83,00:07:26.83,"See you soon. - You rock, Dad!"
153,00:07:29.23,00:07:29.23,- Oh!
154,00:07:30.63,00:07:30.63,- I think that is one of the most romantic things
155,00:07:32.60,00:07:32.60,I have ever heard--
156,00:07:33.80,00:07:33.80,"""the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."""
157,00:07:36.87,00:07:36.87,- This is the best reward.
158,00:07:38.90,00:07:38.90,"I mean, this was the best-- seeing that was everything."
159,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,Thank you. - Good.
160,00:07:44.07,00:07:44.07,"All right, so we figured we had"
161,00:07:45.60,00:07:45.60,your families there with the video camera going.
162,00:07:48.03,00:07:48.03,Might as well involve them in our next reward challenge.
163,00:07:52.60,00:07:52.60,So we asked your family members four questions about you.

165,00:07:59.03,00:07:59.03,The winner of today's reward challenge
166,00:08:00.43,00:08:00.43,will leave here immediately.
167,00:08:01.73,00:08:01.73,"You'll be flown to the Masai Mara,"
168,00:08:03.40,00:08:03.40,"where you will watch the migration of the wildebeest,"
169,00:08:05.93,00:08:05.93,one of the most spectacular things
170,00:08:07.57,00:08:07.57,you'll ever see in your life.
171,00:08:09.73,00:08:09.73,You'll then go to a safari resort tonight.
172,00:08:14.63,00:08:14.63,You'll have a real bed. You'll have a real shower.
173,00:08:18.07,00:08:18.07,You'll have real food.

175,00:08:21.63,00:08:21.63,- What?

177,00:08:26.93,00:08:26.93,(cheering)
178,00:08:28.77,00:08:28.77,"So first question, we asked your family member:"
179,00:08:32.80,00:08:32.80,What is your most embarrassing moment?
180,00:08:44.23,00:08:44.23,"So, Kim, you are up first."
181,00:08:45.47,00:08:45.47,- Throwing up on you on our second date.
182,00:08:47.53,00:08:47.53,"- Okay, let's see what he said."
183,00:08:49.23,00:08:49.23,"- You might ask her what happened on our second date,"
184,00:08:52.37,00:08:52.37,but I'll use a different answer.
185,00:08:55.73,00:08:55.73,Kim disappeared for about two hours
186,00:08:58.00,00:08:58.00,and she did fall asleep on the toilet
187,00:09:00.33,00:09:00.33,and blocked the bathroom for all that time.
188,00:09:02.23,00:09:02.23,- Shoot.
189,00:09:03.63,00:09:03.63,- He had it and then he went with something else.
190,00:09:05.97,00:09:05.97,If you miss the Masai Mara by one question...
191,00:09:08.60,00:09:08.60,- I'll throw up on him again.
192,00:09:11.97,00:09:11.97,- Teresa.
193,00:09:13.17,00:09:13.17,- New York marathon injury.
194,00:09:14.77,00:09:14.77,It took me about all day and night to finish.
195,00:09:17.53,00:09:17.53,- Spilling a full tray of drinks
196,00:09:20.10,00:09:20.10,on first-class passengers.
197,00:09:23.07,00:09:23.07,- God. - Ethan.
198,00:09:25.23,00:09:25.23,- It was-- I was doing my hair for prom
199,00:09:27.90,00:09:27.90,and the curling iron got stuck
200,00:09:29.30,00:09:29.30,and my mom had to cut my hair off.
201,00:09:31.70,00:09:31.70,- All right. We'll see what she said.
202,00:09:33.50,00:09:33.50,- That would be letting in an easy goal
203,00:09:37.70,00:09:37.70,in a very important soccer game.
204,00:09:39.93,00:09:39.93,"- All right, Tom, show us your most embarrassing moment."
205,00:09:41.40,00:09:41.40,"- I was walking around in dirty underwear in the house,"
206,00:09:45.53,00:09:45.53,and there was people in the kitchen.
207,00:09:46.83,00:09:46.83,I walked in the kitchen and met these people
208,00:09:50.10,00:09:50.10,and I had a little stain in my underwear.
209,00:09:53.03,00:09:53.03,- You can't embarrass him. He doesn't give a hoot.
210,00:09:56.43,00:09:56.43,"He just doesn't care, so I can't give you an answer"
211,00:09:58.90,00:09:58.90,because I don't think Tom has ever been embarrassed.
212,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30,"- All right, Kim."
213,00:10:03.73,00:10:03.73,- I kept falling off my bike in a race.
214,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,I was doing a triathlon
215,00:10:07.27,00:10:07.27,and my bathing suit got caught in my bike seat
216,00:10:09.73,00:10:09.73,as I tried to pick my bike up.
217,00:10:10.97,00:10:10.97,All the other racers got a really good view.
218,00:10:13.30,00:10:13.30,- Her most embarrassing moment was when she wiped out
219,00:10:15.40,00:10:15.40,during a triathlon.
220,00:10:16.90,00:10:16.90,"- Yes, Mom, yes!"
221,00:10:18.60,00:10:18.60,- Couldn't get her bike turned around
222,00:10:20.07,00:10:20.07,and her bathing suit even got stuck in her bike.
223,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,"- All right! Yes, Mom!"
224,00:10:23.40,00:10:23.40,Yes! - Good job!
225,00:10:27.20,00:10:27.20,"- All right, Lex, most embarrassing moment."
226,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,"- Back in college, I used to go to a lot of happy hours."
227,00:10:31.03,00:10:31.03,"One time, I got a little too happy."
228,00:10:32.67,00:10:32.67,I threw up in the middle of my human sexuality class.
229,00:10:36.50,00:10:36.50,- That would be in college when he threw up
230,00:10:39.07,00:10:39.07,all over the other students.
231,00:10:40.70,00:10:40.70,- Yes. - There it is.
232,00:10:43.17,00:10:43.17,- That's my wife. Love her.
233,00:10:45.43,00:10:45.43,"- Okay, after the first round,"
234,00:10:46.50,00:10:46.50,"Lex and Kim Powers, up one and one."
235,00:10:50.90,00:10:50.90,- Next question-- what physical trait
236,00:10:53.47,00:10:53.47,do you least like about yourself?
237,00:10:56.13,00:10:56.13,- I think he'll say my feet.
238,00:10:58.07,00:10:58.07,"- It will be her feet. - Oh, baby."
239,00:11:02.67,00:11:02.67,"- I have straight, stringy see-through hair."
240,00:11:05.33,00:11:05.33,- I would have to say that would be her nose.
241,00:11:07.57,00:11:07.57,- Baby!
242,00:11:10.37,00:11:10.37,"- Well, I hate to admit it,"
243,00:11:11.57,00:11:11.57,"but this is my family answering for me,"
244,00:11:13.10,00:11:13.10,and they probably think I said I have none.
245,00:11:15.40,00:11:15.40,- Your legs. - What?
246,00:11:19.33,00:11:19.33,- I'm going to say hair because I would love this--
247,00:11:22.17,00:11:22.17,"if I could grow it over, I'd have it down to my feet."
248,00:11:25.03,00:11:25.03,- He used to say he was a heck of a man when he had hair.
249,00:11:27.73,00:11:27.73,"So, lack of hair. - Good job, Big Tom."
250,00:11:30.70,00:11:30.70,"- Could have gone two ways, but I'm going to say small chest."
251,00:11:32.90,00:11:32.90,- It's her arms.
252,00:11:34.60,00:11:34.60,"- Oh, God, Mom, where did you get that?"
253,00:11:37.33,00:11:37.33,"- My nose. - The hair on his back, sorry."
254,00:11:41.03,00:11:41.03,- What?
255,00:11:43.80,00:11:43.80,You can take a look-- I think I got about six of them.
256,00:11:46.07,00:11:46.07,"- All right, after two rounds, here is where we are at."
257,00:11:48.37,00:11:48.37,Kim Johnson has one. Big Tom has one.
258,00:11:51.00,00:11:51.00,"Young Kim has one, and Lex has one."
259,00:11:53.47,00:11:53.47,"Teresa and Ethan, you guys got to get on the board."
260,00:11:55.30,00:11:55.30,Here's the third question.
261,00:11:56.70,00:11:56.70,What will your family members say is your biggest fear?
262,00:11:59.37,00:11:59.37,Biggest fear?
263,00:12:00.87,00:12:00.87,- Growing old and not being able to do what I want to do.
264,00:12:03.80,00:12:03.80,"- She is really pretty fearless,"
265,00:12:05.80,00:12:05.80,but she is scared of bungee jumping.
266,00:12:07.60,00:12:07.60,- Wrong track.
267,00:12:09.97,00:12:09.97,- My greatest fear and probably only fear
268,00:12:12.00,00:12:12.00,is loss of a loved one.
269,00:12:13.77,00:12:13.77,- Only one I can think of is maybe snakes.
270,00:12:16.00,00:12:16.00,- Snakes?
271,00:12:17.83,00:12:17.83,- I think it's a fear of throwing up.
272,00:12:21.10,00:12:21.10,- Vomiting.
273,00:12:22.43,00:12:22.43,- Yeah!
274,00:12:24.17,00:12:24.17,Woo.
275,00:12:26.43,00:12:26.43,"- On the Mom. - Okay, Big Tom."
276,00:12:28.60,00:12:28.60,- She will say none.
277,00:12:30.73,00:12:30.73,- It's always in every parent's mind
278,00:12:33.07,00:12:33.07,"about their children, so his biggest fear"
279,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40,would be that something would happen to his son.
280,00:12:38.53,00:12:38.53,"- Hard to argue with that. - Yes, it is."
281,00:12:41.23,00:12:41.23,- She's got to get this one-- spiders.
282,00:12:43.67,00:12:43.67,- Her biggest fear is being unfulfilled.
283,00:12:46.27,00:12:46.27,"- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?"
284,00:12:48.13,00:12:48.13,"- Wow, that's deep. - Lex."
285,00:12:50.27,00:12:50.27,- Outliving either of my sons.
286,00:12:51.83,00:12:51.83,Losing one of my boys.
287,00:12:53.23,00:12:53.23,- Something happening to me or the kids.
288,00:12:54.97,00:12:54.97,"- That'll work. - Thanks, honey."
289,00:12:56.77,00:12:56.77,"- Okay, Lex is in the lead with two."
290,00:12:59.30,00:12:59.30,"Kim Johnson, Kim Powers, Ethan and Tom each have one."
291,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,"Teresa, this is the last question."
292,00:13:05.97,00:13:05.97,"Since there is no way you can win,"
293,00:13:07.43,00:13:07.43,we'll leave you out of this one.
294,00:13:09.60,00:13:09.60,What is your greatest achievement?
295,00:13:11.87,00:13:11.87,- I said my family.
296,00:13:13.53,00:13:13.53,"I've been married very happily for 37 years,"
297,00:13:16.17,00:13:16.17,and I have three great kids.
298,00:13:17.50,00:13:17.50,"And not having any family of my own before that,"
299,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23,it just doesn't get any better than this.
300,00:13:22.00,00:13:22.00,"- I think her answer would be a really great family,"
301,00:13:26.20,00:13:26.20,three great kids.
302,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,- Very nice. - Three grandchildren.
303,00:13:28.83,00:13:28.83,"- Yay, yay. - Okay, Ethan."
304,00:13:31.43,00:13:31.43,- Mine will probably have to be playing professional soccer.
305,00:13:35.27,00:13:35.27,- Taking the high school soccer team to the state tournament
306,00:13:39.27,00:13:39.27,as a starting freshman.
307,00:13:40.90,00:13:40.90,- Like I've done nothing after high school.
308,00:13:43.40,00:13:43.40,(laughter)
309,00:13:46.97,00:13:46.97,"- Big Tom, the minute I asked this question,"
310,00:13:48.67,00:13:48.67,you didn't hesitate.
311,00:13:50.03,00:13:50.03,You wrote three letters down. I can tell from here.
312,00:13:52.40,00:13:52.40,- My son. You don't have to play it.
313,00:13:56.17,00:13:56.17,She knows that is my greatest accomplishment.
314,00:13:58.80,00:13:58.80,"- Tom's greatest achievement would be his son, Beau."
315,00:14:02.23,00:14:02.23,- Yeah!
316,00:14:05.27,00:14:05.27,- Got that. - Kim.
317,00:14:06.77,00:14:06.77,"- This is strange, but I said calling off my wedding"
318,00:14:08.73,00:14:08.73,at the last minute. - Hmm.
319,00:14:10.23,00:14:10.23,- Kim's greatest achievement was her solo trip to Europe.
320,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17,"- All right, Lex, get this right,"
321,00:14:16.87,00:14:16.87,you're on your way to the Masai Mara.
322,00:14:18.53,00:14:18.53,"If you don't, you are in a three-way tie."
323,00:14:21.47,00:14:21.47,What did you say?
324,00:14:23.00,00:14:23.00,"- Like Big Tom, I have no doubt, my two beautiful sons,"
325,00:14:26.40,00:14:26.40,crowning achievement.
326,00:14:28.47,00:14:28.47,- What is Lex's greatest achievement?
327,00:14:31.77,00:14:31.77,His boys. - Way to go.
328,00:14:34.93,00:14:34.93,"- Lex, it seems every time I turn around,"
329,00:14:36.90,00:14:36.90,I'm handing you something.
330,00:14:38.03,00:14:38.03,Now I'm handing you my Visa card.
331,00:14:41.50,00:14:41.50,"Go easy on it, please. - I'll try to be kind."
332,00:14:43.33,00:14:43.33,No way. - I can't let you go alone.
333,00:14:46.93,00:14:46.93,You got to pick one of the other five to take with you.
334,00:14:51.10,00:14:51.10,- I'm going to take Big Tom.
335,00:14:52.47,00:14:52.47,"- All right, you guys are going to the Masai Mara."
336,00:14:54.47,00:14:54.47,- I'll be the best date you ever had.
337,00:14:56.63,00:14:56.63,- (laughing)
338,00:15:08.83,00:15:08.83,"- Let's go, Lex, let's get 'em."
339,00:15:10.50,00:15:10.50,- Woo!
340,00:15:11.83,00:15:11.83,(cheering)
341,00:15:16.13,00:15:16.13,"- Oh, yeah."
342,00:15:24.10,00:15:24.10,- We are in an airplane on our way to Masai Mara.
343,00:15:27.47,00:15:27.47,"I mean, it just blows my mind."
344,00:15:30.83,00:15:30.83,"- Just another hour, everything changed."
345,00:15:33.57,00:15:33.57,- It's great.
346,00:15:34.70,00:15:34.70,- I knew when I picked Tom
347,00:15:36.53,00:15:36.53,that it was going to be a roller coaster ride.
348,00:15:38.90,00:15:38.90,If anyone should see something completely different
349,00:15:43.10,00:15:43.10,"and really experience Africa,"
350,00:15:44.40,00:15:44.40,I thought Tom was really kind of deserving.
351,00:15:51.43,00:15:51.43,The plane landed and we were whisked away
352,00:15:54.13,00:15:54.13,to a place called Governor's Camp.
353,00:15:56.93,00:15:56.93,If you can imagine the ultimate five-star luxury hotel
354,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,just literally dropped in the middle of a lush African jungle.
355,00:16:06.20,00:16:06.20,That is what it was.
356,00:16:07.40,00:16:07.40,"It was just, it was like the Garden of Eden."
357,00:16:09.83,00:16:09.83,- Can you believe this? - Oh!
358,00:16:15.10,00:16:15.10,Cool!
359,00:16:17.87,00:16:17.87,"Oh, our own pooper."
360,00:16:22.73,00:16:22.73,"Oh! Hey-- hey, tattoo."
361,00:16:28.80,00:16:28.80,Oh.
362,00:16:31.00,00:16:31.00,- That is the Mara River. - Holy moley.
363,00:16:34.37,00:16:34.37,- The hippos are right there. - Wow.
364,00:16:37.40,00:16:37.40,- Could you just give me your Visa card please.
365,00:16:38.90,00:16:38.90,"- Oh, absolutely. My pleasure."
366,00:16:42.67,00:16:42.67,There it is. - Thank you.
367,00:16:44.27,00:16:44.27,"- Be sure to get your tip out of it, yeah."
368,00:16:48.93,00:16:48.93,- No problem. Sky is the limit.
369,00:16:51.80,00:16:51.80,- Beautiful. Paradise.
370,00:16:54.43,00:16:54.43,"- Jiminy Cheers, my friend."
371,00:16:57.10,00:16:57.10,- Cheers to you.
372,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,Mmm.
373,00:17:05.87,00:17:05.87,- We've eaten more right now than we have in 30 days.
374,00:17:10.23,00:17:10.23,- I don't think we would be well advised
375,00:17:12.47,00:17:12.47,to describe this place in all its detail and glory
376,00:17:16.73,00:17:16.73,"to everyone else in the tribe,"
377,00:17:18.03,00:17:18.03,because I think they might just kill us and bury us.
378,00:17:21.07,00:17:21.07,This is a crime considering they're back there right now.
379,00:17:23.87,00:17:23.87,- We can't tell them everything.
380,00:17:24.93,00:17:24.93,- Cooking mush in boiling water.
381,00:17:28.57,00:17:28.57,- We are having so much more fun
382,00:17:30.43,00:17:30.43,"than the guys are on their trip, don't you think?"
383,00:17:32.43,00:17:32.43,- No.
384,00:17:34.87,00:17:34.87,- You don't even care to joke about it?
385,00:17:36.93,00:17:36.93,- No. - No.
386,00:17:39.03,00:17:39.03,I think the guys are probably on the trip of a lifetime.
387,00:17:42.70,00:17:42.70,And we're not. We are making cards.
388,00:17:44.47,00:17:44.47,- We are making a deck of cards.
389,00:17:46.60,00:17:46.60,"I love cards and I know lots of games,"
390,00:17:48.60,00:17:48.60,so I told them I would teach them some games.
391,00:17:50.77,00:17:50.77,- We're making the best of it. - Mm-hmm.
392,00:17:52.23,00:17:52.23,"- We're very jealous, not even of just the trip,"
393,00:17:54.53,00:17:54.53,but we're jealous of the food
394,00:17:56.90,00:17:56.90,that they're going to get.
395,00:17:58.40,00:17:58.40,- I'm jealous mostly of the food that they're going to get.
396,00:18:04.90,00:18:04.90,- Look at the tusk on that hog.
397,00:18:08.13,00:18:08.13,"Oink! Goodness, I feel like Marlin Perkins."
398,00:18:13.63,00:18:13.63,- (laughing)
399,00:18:14.97,00:18:14.97,- We just went on basically a safari.
400,00:18:17.30,00:18:17.30,We got in a vehicle and got right up
401,00:18:20.30,00:18:20.30,in amongst thousands of wildebeests.
402,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,We got right in the middle of them.
403,00:18:24.83,00:18:24.83,They didn't know what to do. We didn't either.
404,00:18:41.37,00:18:41.37,They are crazier than hell. They are ugly.
405,00:18:43.33,00:18:43.33,They're ugly as a girl I used to date back home.
406,00:18:45.90,00:18:45.90,(grumbling moans and calls)
407,00:18:50.80,00:18:50.80,They are calling each other.
408,00:18:52.43,00:18:52.43,They're mating.
409,00:18:53.47,00:18:53.47,"Hell, they're butting heads"
410,00:18:54.50,00:18:54.50,and knocking each other to the ground.
411,00:18:55.80,00:18:55.80,It's a cluster.
412,00:18:57.23,00:18:57.23,It is the damnedest thing you've ever seen.
413,00:18:58.83,00:18:58.83,(grumbling moans and calls)
414,00:19:02.27,00:19:02.27,(imitating calls)
415,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67,They sound like me on a good Saturday night when I get home.
416,00:19:08.90,00:19:08.90,- Two million head of animal moving at the same time.
417,00:19:12.33,00:19:12.33,Two million head of wild animal.
418,00:19:15.20,00:19:15.20,The safari was amazing.
419,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90,I'm seeing just about every type of wildlife
420,00:19:21.07,00:19:21.07,"that I've wanted to see,"
421,00:19:22.70,00:19:22.70,and I'm seeing it all in the space of an hour.
422,00:19:25.50,00:19:25.50,"- We are amongst them, ain't we?"
423,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,"Look at him, look at him. There, mate."
424,00:19:28.67,00:19:28.67,- Ah. - Oh!
425,00:19:30.87,00:19:30.87,That's the way-- Oh!
426,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"- See, even with big cats, yawns are contagious."
427,00:19:36.67,00:19:36.67,"The babies, so cute."
428,00:19:39.70,00:19:39.70,(elephant trumpeting)
429,00:19:40.97,00:19:40.97,(laughter)
430,00:19:42.20,00:19:42.20,- He thought he was doing something for us.
431,00:19:45.70,00:19:45.70,He really thinks he is doing something.
432,00:19:59.37,00:19:59.37,"- When we came back from the safari, we were just bubbling."
433,00:20:03.23,00:20:03.23,"- What is this right here, Tommy?"
434,00:20:05.50,00:20:05.50,"- All of a sudden, I looked up there on the side of the river"
435,00:20:09.13,00:20:09.13,"and I seen two chairs and a table and on that table,"
436,00:20:12.30,00:20:12.30,it had a few spirits on there.
437,00:20:14.63,00:20:14.63,"So I told Lex, I said,"
438,00:20:16.80,00:20:16.80,looks like we might ought to have a toast.
439,00:20:19.13,00:20:19.13,- Thank you for today. - Thank you for coming.
440,00:20:29.40,00:20:29.40,- (gibberish) God-- holy.
441,00:20:32.93,00:20:32.93,- Both Tom and I like to tip a cocktail back
442,00:20:35.63,00:20:35.63,now and again at home.
443,00:20:37.30,00:20:37.30,So our first thought coming back was I would kill somebody
444,00:20:39.27,00:20:39.27,to get a nice cold beer in me.
445,00:20:40.70,00:20:40.70,"This place is wonderful because if you want something,"
446,00:20:45.37,00:20:45.37,there is somebody right there.
447,00:20:46.37,00:20:46.37,They can almost read your mind.
448,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47,To the game.
449,00:20:53.53,00:20:53.53,I've never drank beer with a mustache before.
450,00:20:55.77,00:20:55.77,- I never drunk beer with a hippo before.
451,00:20:58.73,00:20:58.73,(laughing)
452,00:21:01.53,00:21:01.53,"- When the dinner bell rang,"
453,00:21:02.97,00:21:02.97,Tom wasn't quite done with his bottle of bourbon.
454,00:21:05.27,00:21:05.27,"Tom is definitely not one to waste anything,"
455,00:21:07.67,00:21:07.67,so he took his bottle with.
456,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,"In fact, it was in his pocket."
457,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,"- You had a good safari? - Oh, beautiful, thank you."
458,00:21:16.37,00:21:16.37,- Thank you.
459,00:21:20.83,00:21:20.83,"- Oh, this is nice. - (laughing)"
460,00:21:24.87,00:21:24.87,- We're grilling down there.
461,00:21:26.47,00:21:26.47,"We have some chicken, we have some lamb."
462,00:21:30.10,00:21:30.10,"- Oh, sheep. - Perfect."
463,00:21:33.40,00:21:33.40,"- They brought me a piece of lamb this big around,"
464,00:21:36.87,00:21:36.87,and I'm a meat eater.
465,00:21:38.37,00:21:38.37,"I mean, that salad stuff,"
466,00:21:39.83,00:21:39.83,"it's not for women or something, but I like meat."
467,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,It was absolutely melting in my mouth.
468,00:21:45.30,00:21:45.30,"- Frances, it's beautiful. Thank you."
469,00:21:47.03,00:21:47.03,"- You the man, Fran!"
470,00:21:50.70,00:21:50.70,Fix me another sheep.
471,00:21:56.53,00:21:56.53,- I hope you're hungry. - I'm hungry.
472,00:21:59.00,00:21:59.00,"- Good, because I'm going to imagine"
473,00:22:01.73,00:22:01.73,this tastes like mashed potatoes.
474,00:22:06.70,00:22:06.70,- Maybe not. - No.
475,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,It's not working. Still tastes like corn mush.
476,00:22:12.03,00:22:12.03,- I don't ever want to eat corn again.
477,00:22:14.23,00:22:14.23,"Not a corn tortilla, not corn flakes, not corn chowder,"
478,00:22:21.63,00:22:21.63,"not corn in the can, not cream corn,"
479,00:22:23.70,00:22:23.70,"not corn bread, no corn muffins,"
480,00:22:27.13,00:22:27.13,"no burritos, no corn tortillas, no popcorn at the movies."
481,00:22:31.77,00:22:31.77,"No more corn, please."
482,00:22:35.33,00:22:35.33,(thunder rumbling)
483,00:22:37.63,00:22:37.63,"- Listen to that thunder. - It's raining, all right."
484,00:22:40.80,00:22:40.80,- There has not been a drop of rain hit my ass
485,00:22:43.60,00:22:43.60,in 40 days and 40 nights.
486,00:22:46.07,00:22:46.07,I want to get up there and put myself in it.
487,00:22:48.77,00:22:48.77,"- When we got back from dinner,"
488,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,Tom decided to promptly help himself
489,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,to as much of the bourbon as possible.
490,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,- You want to see a rabbit pulled out of a hat?
491,00:22:58.60,00:22:58.60,- (laughing)
492,00:23:00.93,00:23:00.93,"I know he was liquored and loaded,"
493,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,but it just made the whole night that much funnier.
494,00:23:07.30,00:23:07.30,"- Lex, I'm glad you picked me."
495,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,"- I'm glad I picked you, too."
496,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,- You'd probably have been bored with somebody else.
497,00:23:13.50,00:23:13.50,You knew you...
498,00:23:14.90,00:23:14.90,"Here, you probably one of the best ones."
499,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,"Hey, bartender, fix me a toddy."
500,00:23:21.20,00:23:21.20,"Oh, Big Tom will love everybody."
501,00:23:23.77,00:23:23.77,(laughing)
502,00:23:25.53,00:23:25.53,Don't worry about them crocs--
503,00:23:27.60,00:23:27.60,Old big Tom got some stinky socks.
504,00:23:30.30,00:23:30.30,(laughing)
505,00:23:32.37,00:23:32.37,- Tom was spent.
506,00:23:34.40,00:23:34.40,I kind of-- I took him to bed.
507,00:23:36.40,00:23:36.40,- Here we go. Follow me.
508,00:23:39.53,00:23:39.53,Here we go. All right.
509,00:23:41.80,00:23:41.80,"Feet in there. - Hey, bartender."
510,00:23:44.03,00:23:44.03,"- All I ask is that if you got to puke, you go outside."
511,00:23:47.83,00:23:47.83,"- Yeah, that's... That's the American way."
512,00:23:51.30,00:23:51.30,"- All right? - Hey, Lex, thank you."
513,00:23:53.33,00:23:53.33,"- Hey, my friend, you're welcome."
514,00:23:55.97,00:23:55.97,- I'd do it for you. - I know you would.
515,00:23:58.53,00:23:58.53,"I know you would. - Damn right, I would."
516,00:24:16.03,00:24:16.03,- Morning. - Good morning.
517,00:24:19.57,00:24:19.57,"- This morning when I woke up,"
518,00:24:21.40,00:24:21.40,"my head, it wouldn't have fit in a wash tub."
519,00:24:25.00,00:24:25.00,"I said, where am I? I had to look around."
520,00:24:27.27,00:24:27.27,I was in a bed.
521,00:24:28.63,00:24:28.63,- We are just waking up early
522,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,because we got an early morning wake-up call
523,00:24:31.60,00:24:31.60,for balloon ride time.
524,00:24:34.97,00:24:34.97,- I drunk a glass of water and eat four or five cookies.
525,00:24:38.93,00:24:38.93,"Well, it was on again-- I just got tanked back up."
526,00:24:42.97,00:24:42.97,Woo!
527,00:24:47.83,00:24:47.83,- Good morning.
528,00:24:49.03,00:24:49.03,"- Good morning. How you doing, Captain?"
529,00:24:50.30,00:24:50.30,- Welcome aboard. - Little bit more heat.
530,00:24:55.03,00:24:55.03,"- My God, he pull that and squirt that fire up there"
531,00:24:58.10,00:24:58.10,and it would shoot a flame like a dragon up in there.
532,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,(whooshing)
533,00:25:01.40,00:25:01.40,"And when he did, here we go."
534,00:25:05.03,00:25:05.03,Goodness gracious. Holy moley.
535,00:25:11.20,00:25:11.20,I was almost this high last night.
536,00:25:13.50,00:25:13.50,- I think you were higher.
537,00:25:17.93,00:25:17.93,"- This guy, Rob, he is from England."
538,00:25:21.60,00:25:21.60,"Every time we get talking to him,"
539,00:25:23.27,00:25:23.27,"the thing would keep going down, down."
540,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,I could see a tree in front of us.
541,00:25:28.47,00:25:28.47,"Oh, my gosh, I'd kind of shout, and he'd say, oh, and then..."
542,00:25:34.83,00:25:34.83,- That's pretty good.
543,00:25:37.30,00:25:37.30,"- Well, crikey, after 30 years,"
544,00:25:39.27,00:25:39.27,"if I can't get it right by now, I never will."
545,00:25:40.97,00:25:40.97,- Yeah.
546,00:25:54.60,00:25:54.60,"- 30 years, you ever had to crash?"
547,00:25:57.07,00:25:57.07,- Balloons are wonderfully safe.
548,00:25:58.87,00:25:58.87,The most dangerous thing about ballooning
549,00:26:00.33,00:26:00.33,is actually spilling the champagne when you land.
550,00:26:08.17,00:26:08.17,- Look at the hyena. - He lives there.
551,00:26:11.10,00:26:11.10,- See him. Look at him run.
552,00:26:13.43,00:26:13.43,"Big Tom, look at that. This is the way to see it."
553,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40,Looking straight down into the jungle
554,00:26:19.93,00:26:19.93,looking straight on overhead on wildlife.
555,00:26:23.17,00:26:23.17,"We are just whisking through the stuff,"
556,00:26:25.10,00:26:25.10,"you know, while the sun is coming up."
557,00:26:26.40,00:26:26.40,It was amazing.
558,00:26:28.43,00:26:28.43,It was-- leaves you breathless.
559,00:26:33.40,00:26:33.40,Look at the little hippo over there.
560,00:26:35.20,00:26:35.20,"- They spend all night eating grass,"
561,00:26:38.13,00:26:38.13,then they spend all day in the river getting rid of it.
562,00:26:43.03,00:26:43.03,"- Considering where we've been, just to see the green,"
563,00:26:45.70,00:26:45.70,it makes you appreciate it so much more.
564,00:26:48.27,00:26:48.27,I hate to even blink.
565,00:26:49.67,00:26:49.67,I'm afraid I'll miss something.
566,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,- There are wildebeest below us.
567,00:26:52.80,00:26:52.80,- I see two wildebeests just bombing along.
568,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,"I said, ""Lex, ain't that funny?"""
569,00:26:57.40,00:26:57.40,"I said, ""All them wildebeests we've seen-- these two"
570,00:27:00.23,00:27:00.23,"are down here next to the river by themselves."""
571,00:27:02.90,00:27:02.90,"I said, ""If I was a lion, I'd pick that little one out."
572,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73,"It'd be a good meal."""
573,00:27:07.10,00:27:07.10,I had no longer said that
574,00:27:08.83,00:27:08.83,"than all of a sudden, a lion popped up."
575,00:27:11.30,00:27:11.30,"- Look, look, look! A lion!"
576,00:27:12.60,00:27:12.60,Look at that. Look at that.
577,00:27:14.27,00:27:14.27,"Oh, my God."
578,00:27:21.07,00:27:21.07,"- All of a sudden that lion kind of gives up and I said,"
579,00:27:23.43,00:27:23.43,"""Well, the wildebeest has won."""
580,00:27:25.33,00:27:25.33,"About that time, here popped another one up."
581,00:27:28.53,00:27:28.53,That lion had ran the wildebeest into the other one.
582,00:27:31.60,00:27:31.60,"- Wow! Oh, my God."
583,00:27:35.90,00:27:35.90,- Now can you believe that? - Unbelievable.
584,00:27:38.77,00:27:38.77,Nice. Got it!
585,00:27:44.77,00:27:44.77,Just like he said. Death by asphyxiation.
586,00:27:48.63,00:27:48.63,He's just holding his mouth on top of that wildebeest there.
587,00:27:52.03,00:27:52.03,"Where there were two wildebeest, now there's one."
588,00:27:55.63,00:27:55.63,That was a treat. - Fantastic.
589,00:27:57.20,00:27:57.20,That is rare. That is rare.
590,00:27:58.87,00:27:58.87,- That was cool.
591,00:28:02.30,00:28:02.30,- My mind has been a pretty little old tight thing.
592,00:28:05.00,00:28:05.00,It has not been expanded very much.
593,00:28:06.93,00:28:06.93,But this whole thing just gave me new life.
594,00:28:10.20,00:28:10.20,"At 45, I thought I had done some things"
595,00:28:13.00,00:28:13.00,and I found out I ain't done diddly.
596,00:28:15.60,00:28:15.60,This just shows me that there is more to life
597,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,than just what is around the corner at the house.
598,00:28:25.60,00:28:25.60,- Going back to camp at this point is going to be miserable.
599,00:28:28.60,00:28:28.60,"I mean, I'm feeling sick about it."
600,00:28:30.07,00:28:30.07,- The same seats have been reserved for you.
601,00:28:31.77,00:28:31.77,"- Oh, thank you much."
602,00:28:33.30,00:28:33.30,- Going back to camp now means going back to the game.
603,00:28:36.97,00:28:36.97,"I'm going to be the last person standing,"
604,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,"so, in the next couple of hours,"
605,00:28:39.80,00:28:39.80,"I'll have to be on my game again,"
606,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,as much as it pains me to admit it.
607,00:28:47.87,00:28:47.87,"- If you don't have any of those cards,"
608,00:28:49.73,00:28:49.73,you can change it with an eight
609,00:28:51.63,00:28:51.63,to any suit you want.
610,00:28:53.03,00:28:53.03,- And you call it? - You say clubs or whatever.
611,00:28:55.50,00:28:55.50,- I saw the airplane. - Oh.
612,00:28:59.23,00:28:59.23,- They're back. - Hey!
613,00:29:02.53,00:29:02.53,"- We waved and, you know, pretended to be really excited"
614,00:29:05.27,00:29:05.27,that they were coming back.
615,00:29:06.50,00:29:06.50,Yet we were just hoping they wouldn't come back
616,00:29:07.87,00:29:07.87,bundles of energy because we are on a definitely
617,00:29:11.37,00:29:11.37,different wavelength than those guys.
618,00:29:13.13,00:29:13.13,"We were, like, struggling, depressed,"
619,00:29:15.23,00:29:15.23,"you know, hoping we could go to sleep."
620,00:29:17.27,00:29:17.27,- Hey. - Hello.
621,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,- They came back and very subtly and slowly
622,00:29:23.00,00:29:23.00,"described their adventures, which sounded wonderful to us."
623,00:29:25.83,00:29:25.83,- I know how rich people vacation in Africa now.
624,00:29:27.97,00:29:27.97,"- The wildebeest was flying, zigzagging."
625,00:29:30.90,00:29:30.90,"I mean, she was just cat and mouse."
626,00:29:33.63,00:29:33.63,"- It was neat hearing about everything they did,"
627,00:29:35.43,00:29:35.43,but my mind is kind of going in different directions
628,00:29:37.87,00:29:37.87,"on what to do, and now at this point,"
629,00:29:39.87,00:29:39.87,"instead of boggling myself down mentally with strategy,"
630,00:29:43.97,00:29:43.97,I'm really just holding out to see what happens
631,00:29:46.47,00:29:46.47,with the immunity challenge.
632,00:29:56.50,00:29:56.50,"- Hey, guys. - Hey, Jeff."
633,00:29:58.40,00:29:58.40,"- Okay, today's immunity challenge"
634,00:30:00.13,00:30:00.13,works a little differently.
635,00:30:01.60,00:30:01.60,"Today, you win by eliminating the others."
636,00:30:04.73,00:30:04.73,There are 18 hanging pots--
637,00:30:06.10,00:30:06.10,you each have your name on three of those pots.
638,00:30:08.40,00:30:08.40,Those pots represent your immunity.
639,00:30:10.80,00:30:10.80,"As long as you have a pot hanging,"
640,00:30:11.93,00:30:11.93,you are still in the game.
641,00:30:13.10,00:30:13.10,"When the pots are gone, so are you."
642,00:30:14.83,00:30:14.83,These sticks are traditional African weapons called rungas.
643,00:30:18.13,00:30:18.13,A skilled warrior can crack a skull with one of these.
644,00:30:22.07,00:30:22.07,All you have to do is break the pots
645,00:30:24.30,00:30:24.30,and make them fall to the ground.
646,00:30:25.70,00:30:25.70,You'll throw one stick per round.
647,00:30:27.60,00:30:27.60,"After each round, you'll switch positions."
648,00:30:30.60,00:30:30.60,"Your goal, break your opponents pots before they break yours."
649,00:30:34.07,00:30:34.07,Last one left standing wins immunity.
650,00:30:36.47,00:30:36.47,"So, let me have it back."
651,00:30:40.97,00:30:40.97,Now here we go. Immunity at stake once again.
652,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,Survivors ready? Go!
653,00:30:56.13,00:30:56.13,"First one. - Tommy, that hurts."
654,00:30:58.57,00:30:58.57,"- Tommy, good shot."
655,00:31:00.33,00:31:00.33,"- All right, everybody rotate two steps down."
656,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,Teresa still has two pots left. Everyone else has three.
657,00:31:06.40,00:31:06.40,Survivors ready? Go!
658,00:31:15.73,00:31:15.73,"Tom, with another bust,"
659,00:31:17.43,00:31:17.43,"taking out one of Teresa's, one of Kim Powers."
660,00:31:20.87,00:31:20.87,- I'm not talking to you.
661,00:31:22.47,00:31:22.47,- Survivors ready? Go!
662,00:31:30.93,00:31:30.93,"- You hit me, Tom."
663,00:31:32.37,00:31:32.37,"- Big Tom so far has taken out one of Teresa's,"
664,00:31:34.67,00:31:34.67,one of Lex's and one of Kim Powers.
665,00:31:36.97,00:31:36.97,Toss.
666,00:31:42.77,00:31:42.77,- Ah!
667,00:31:43.93,00:31:43.93,"- Kim Johnson, you hit your own pot."
668,00:31:45.77,00:31:45.77,- I don't think it fell. - That pot is dead.
669,00:31:48.00,00:31:48.00,"Teresa, Lex, Kim Powers and Kim Johnson have each lost one pot."
670,00:31:53.30,00:31:53.30,Survivors ready? Throw.
671,00:31:59.67,00:31:59.67,"Was that you, Ethan, took out Kim Powers?"
672,00:32:01.63,00:32:01.63,"- Yeah, sorry, Kimmy."
673,00:32:03.03,00:32:03.03,"- Kim Powers, you're down to one pot left."
674,00:32:04.87,00:32:04.87,"He did offer up an apology. - Yeah, whatever."
675,00:32:07.27,00:32:07.27,- It was sort of a... quiet one.
676,00:32:09.20,00:32:09.20,- I heard it. I heard it.
677,00:32:10.30,00:32:10.30,- Survivors ready. Throw.
678,00:32:17.63,00:32:17.63,Ethan took out Teresa. Tom took out Teresa.
679,00:32:21.10,00:32:21.10,"Have a seat on the bench. Kim Powers, you are down to one."
680,00:32:24.03,00:32:24.03,"Lex, you are down to two. Everybody else is good."
681,00:32:26.50,00:32:26.50,Survivors ready. Toss.
682,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,"Kim Powers. Out of the game, Kim."
683,00:32:35.27,00:32:35.27,"Sorry, but, Tom, you are going down."
684,00:32:37.50,00:32:37.50,- Watch how you talk. - Toss.
685,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,Ethan takes his first hit.
686,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,Survivors ready. Throw.
687,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,Tom takes a hit from Kim Johnson.
688,00:32:54.27,00:32:54.27,Survivors ready. Throw.
689,00:32:58.70,00:32:58.70,Ethan takes another hit from Big Tom.
690,00:33:01.37,00:33:01.37,Ethan down to one left. Everybody else has two.
691,00:33:03.80,00:33:03.80,Survivors ready? Throw.
692,00:33:09.07,00:33:09.07,"You got one left, Kim. Ethan, you got one left."
693,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,Lex and Tom have two.
694,00:33:13.23,00:33:13.23,Survivors ready. Throw.
695,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,Ethan takes out Lex.
696,00:33:20.70,00:33:20.70,"Lex, Kim Johnson, Ethan, down to one."
697,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,Throw.
698,00:33:28.27,00:33:28.27,"- Oh, you! - (imitates donkey braying)"
699,00:33:31.97,00:33:31.97,- Ethan out of the game. We're down to three.
700,00:33:34.03,00:33:34.03,"Big Tom, you have two pots left."
701,00:33:35.67,00:33:35.67,"K.J. and Lex, one pot. Throw."
702,00:33:45.53,00:33:45.53,"- Kim Johnson, you are hanging on by a thread,"
703,00:33:47.57,00:33:47.57,but you are still in.
704,00:33:49.27,00:33:49.27,- You rat.
705,00:33:50.97,00:33:50.97,- Survivors ready. Throw.
706,00:33:59.63,00:33:59.63,"Lex, you are done. We're down to two."
707,00:34:04.43,00:34:04.43,"Big Tom and K.J. K.J., you have one pot left."
708,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,"Big Tom, you have two."
709,00:34:09.53,00:34:09.53,Survivors ready? Toss.
710,00:34:16.60,00:34:16.60,"Whoa! Kim, you took out one of Tom's."
711,00:34:19.90,00:34:19.90,"Tom took out your last one. - Good work, Tom."
712,00:34:22.13,00:34:22.13,"- About time, Tommy, about time."
713,00:34:24.20,00:34:24.20,"- Hey, baby. - Good job."
714,00:34:26.80,00:34:26.80,"- Big Tom, get over here."
715,00:34:28.50,00:34:28.50,- Every dog has his day.
716,00:34:29.97,00:34:29.97,- Let's see if this will fit around your neck.
717,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30,Turn around.
718,00:34:32.87,00:34:32.87,"- Hey, watch Buster the boil there."
719,00:34:34.47,00:34:34.47,- There we go. Congratulations.
720,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,Nice work. - Yes.
721,00:34:39.13,00:34:39.13,"- It was about time for me, boys."
722,00:34:40.67,00:34:40.67,"I was lucky. - Hey, good shot."
723,00:34:51.27,00:34:51.27,(laughter and chatter)
724,00:34:54.30,00:34:54.30,"- Seven days. Seven days, seven days."
725,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83,- Seven days. - Day 33.
726,00:35:01.27,00:35:01.27,"- Every now and then, I like giggle to myself."
727,00:35:03.87,00:35:03.87,"I'm like, ""Oh, my God, you know, I'm almost there."""
728,00:35:05.77,00:35:05.77,"You know, I don't want to, you know,"
729,00:35:07.10,00:35:07.10,I don't want to screw anything up
730,00:35:08.83,00:35:08.83,"and it's exciting, it's really exciting."
731,00:35:13.23,00:35:13.23,"- Nobody can vote for me when we go to Tribal Council,"
732,00:35:17.87,00:35:17.87,so I'm guaranteed to be here tomorrow.
733,00:35:20.37,00:35:20.37,"Somebody is going to leave tonight,"
734,00:35:21.80,00:35:21.80,but it ain't going to be me.
735,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,- T-Bird's got-- she's got a lot of fire in her belly.
736,00:35:34.47,00:35:34.47,I know that there's nothing more dangerous
737,00:35:36.03,00:35:36.03,than a desperate animal--
738,00:35:37.67,00:35:37.67,an animal or a person that wants something bad enough
739,00:35:41.13,00:35:41.13,that they're willing to just try anything.
740,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47,- I really don't want to see the guys come down to the end.
741,00:35:50.30,00:35:50.30,"- No, I don't either."
742,00:35:52.50,00:35:52.50,- If you go up against any of the guys in the jury...
743,00:35:54.53,00:35:54.53,- The guys are going to win. - Probably.
744,00:35:56.37,00:35:56.37,- I talked to Teresa.
745,00:35:58.63,00:35:58.63,"Her plan was to, basically try to get the girls to get together"
746,00:36:01.73,00:36:01.73,"and maybe round up Tommy or something, and vote against Lex."
747,00:36:04.73,00:36:04.73,- There is three of us and three of them.
748,00:36:07.10,00:36:07.10,"- Yeah, but they want Lex first."
749,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,- Right.
750,00:36:10.23,00:36:10.23,- But I don't know that Tom is going to vote for Lex.
751,00:36:12.10,00:36:12.10,- Tom-- I say Tom will vote for Lex.
752,00:36:14.07,00:36:14.07,- You do?
753,00:36:15.27,00:36:15.27,"- If we could get one more to side with us,"
754,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,we could get Lex off.
755,00:36:18.77,00:36:18.77,This is the time you got to start thinking who do you want
756,00:36:20.70,00:36:20.70,to go to the end with and who do you want off?
757,00:36:23.53,00:36:23.53,I think I'll vote for Lex next.
758,00:36:26.03,00:36:26.03,"- Listen, I'm not stupid."
759,00:36:27.40,00:36:27.40,"Anything that includes me sounds good, you know?"
760,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"- If I live to be 100, I still can't thank Lex enough"
761,00:36:39.53,00:36:39.53,for him giving me the opportunity
762,00:36:41.90,00:36:41.90,"to go on our safari,"
763,00:36:43.57,00:36:43.57,"but even after going, I'm still irritated with Lex."
764,00:36:47.37,00:36:47.37,I don't think he did me right.
765,00:36:49.03,00:36:49.03,Lex recruited Brandon to save him.
766,00:36:52.93,00:36:52.93,I felt like Lex betrayed me.
767,00:36:56.17,00:36:56.17,He knows my feelings on that.
768,00:37:12.57,00:37:12.57,"- Now bring in the jury. Kelly, Frank, Brandon."
769,00:37:22.53,00:37:22.53,"33 days. Big week for you, Big Tom."
770,00:37:26.83,00:37:26.83,"Win immunity, go to the Mara."
771,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,- It's... we haven't got time
772,00:37:32.90,00:37:32.90,to tell you how big a trip it was.
773,00:37:35.53,00:37:35.53,Unbelievable.
774,00:37:36.80,00:37:36.80,Probably the best two days of my life.
775,00:37:39.27,00:37:39.27,There is no way I can repay Lex for the taking me along.
776,00:37:43.53,00:37:43.53,"I mean, if I live to be 100,"
777,00:37:45.13,00:37:45.13,thank you don't go far enough.
778,00:37:47.00,00:37:47.00,"- Lex, from your point of view,"
779,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,how was Tom as a traveling partner?
780,00:37:50.23,00:37:50.23,"- Never a dull moment, had a great time."
781,00:37:53.10,00:37:53.10,It was a blast.
782,00:37:55.63,00:37:55.63,"- Without thinking, going to ask you a question,"
783,00:37:57.70,00:37:57.70,give me the first thing that comes to your mind.
784,00:37:59.67,00:37:59.67,"Ethan, when you think about home what do you miss most?"
785,00:38:02.33,00:38:02.33,- Couch. - Teresa?
786,00:38:03.37,00:38:03.37,- Children. Children.
787,00:38:04.47,00:38:04.47,- The ability to be totally relaxed.
788,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,"- Wife and kids, no doubt. - My mom."
789,00:38:10.50,00:38:10.50,- Cheeseburger.
790,00:38:12.33,00:38:12.33,(laughter)
791,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50,"- So with the exception of Big Tom,"
792,00:38:16.30,00:38:16.30,"a lot of it is family, loved ones."
793,00:38:18.87,00:38:18.87,Are they going to be proud of how you played the game so far?
794,00:38:22.30,00:38:22.30,"How about for you, Kim Powers?"
795,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,"- I've never even camped before,"
796,00:38:24.87,00:38:24.87,so I think they'll be pretty proud
797,00:38:26.60,00:38:26.60,that I actually made it 33 days sleeping outside.
798,00:38:29.07,00:38:29.07,"- Big Tom, are you proud with how you played the game?"
799,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,- Maybe.
800,00:38:35.50,00:38:35.50,Maybe me and Lex had a moment or two.
801,00:38:38.20,00:38:38.20,"I might cringe a little,"
802,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,but I don't remember that much about it.
803,00:38:41.80,00:38:41.80,"Other than that, I have-- I hold my head up."
804,00:38:46.10,00:38:46.10,I have no regrets.
805,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"- How about you, Teresa?"
806,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,- Probably wouldn't have started out
807,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,building such an alliance when I started.
808,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,"I think that caused a lot of friction with our tribe,"
809,00:38:56.93,00:38:56.93,so I wouldn't have started out that way.
810,00:38:58.97,00:38:58.97,"- Kim, how about for you?"
811,00:39:00.53,00:39:00.53,- I feel that I've played the game the way I run my life.
812,00:39:03.27,00:39:03.27,I'm very proud to have been here.
813,00:39:07.27,00:39:07.27,"- How about you, Ethan?"
814,00:39:08.63,00:39:08.63,- I like the way I've been playing the game.
815,00:39:09.97,00:39:09.97,I'm having a lot of fun.
816,00:39:11.23,00:39:11.23,"So far it has gone pretty well,"
817,00:39:13.73,00:39:13.73,"but, I don't know-- it could change tomorrow."
818,00:39:16.90,00:39:16.90,"- Lex, three out of the last four challenges you've won."
819,00:39:20.93,00:39:20.93,Been a while since you've been to Tribal Council
820,00:39:22.77,00:39:22.77,without that necklace around your neck.
821,00:39:25.10,00:39:25.10,How different is it tonight?
822,00:39:26.73,00:39:26.73,"- Well, I mean, it feels a lot different"
823,00:39:28.27,00:39:28.27,not having the protection
824,00:39:29.70,00:39:29.70,and the defense of that immunity necklace.
825,00:39:31.67,00:39:31.67,I might be a target.
826,00:39:33.47,00:39:33.47,"I mean, sure-- and I've seen my name"
827,00:39:35.67,00:39:35.67,on more than one or two cards at previous Tribal Councils.
828,00:39:38.27,00:39:38.27,So I know what it's like
829,00:39:40.00,00:39:40.00,to almost be taking that walk of shame.
830,00:39:42.17,00:39:42.17,But that's the reality of Tribal Council.
831,00:39:44.40,00:39:44.40,"And, you know, I'm here to try to make it through."
832,00:39:48.80,00:39:48.80,- It's time to vote. Big Tom you're first.
833,00:40:11.53,00:40:11.53,- This is the part of the game I hate.
834,00:40:13.47,00:40:13.47,Having to vote someone out of the tribe
835,00:40:15.10,00:40:15.10,that you really care about.
836,00:40:16.33,00:40:16.33,"I'm stoked you made it this far, though."
837,00:40:17.57,00:40:17.57,I'm really stoked.
838,00:40:35.53,00:40:35.53,- You're a strong competitor.
839,00:40:38.03,00:40:38.03,That's why I'm giving you my vote.
840,00:40:39.83,00:40:39.83,"I'm still crazy about you, though."
841,00:40:45.73,00:40:45.73,- I'll go tally the votes.
842,00:40:58.03,00:40:58.03,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
843,00:41:00.40,00:41:00.40,Person will be asked to leave
844,00:41:01.43,00:41:01.43,the Tribal Council area immediately.
845,00:41:03.10,00:41:03.10,I'll read the votes.
846,00:41:08.53,00:41:08.53,"First vote, Lex."
847,00:41:15.30,00:41:15.30,"Lex. Two votes, Lex."
848,00:41:19.90,00:41:19.90,Kim Powers.
849,00:41:26.13,00:41:26.13,Kim Powers.
850,00:41:27.37,00:41:27.37,Two votes Kim. Two votes Lex.
851,00:41:34.10,00:41:34.10,"Kim, that's three votes Kim, two votes, Lex."
852,00:41:40.20,00:41:40.20,Last vote...
853,00:41:42.07,00:41:42.07,Kim Powers.
854,00:41:44.20,00:41:44.20,You need to bring me your torch.
855,00:41:56.07,00:41:56.07,"Kim, the tribe has spoken."
856,00:42:02.37,00:42:02.37,It's time for you to go.
857,00:42:10.10,00:42:10.10,You can head back to camp. Good night.
858,00:42:31.37,00:42:31.37,- Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
859,00:42:34.87,00:42:34.87,- Next time on Survivor...
860,00:42:37.07,00:42:37.07,Moto Maji endures new hardships.
861,00:42:39.37,00:42:39.37,- We got an elephant disrespecting our spring.
862,00:42:41.87,00:42:41.87,- One Survivor becomes the ambassador
863,00:42:43.87,00:42:43.87,of a momentous delivery
864,00:42:46.10,00:42:46.10,and a long-standing alliance is thrown into question.
865,00:42:49.20,00:42:49.20,- If I think that he's in a situation
866,00:42:50.90,00:42:50.90,where he's about to screw me over
867,00:42:52.03,00:42:52.03,"and stab me in the back, I'll cut his throat."
868,00:42:59.87,00:42:59.87,- It was a heck of a game.
869,00:43:01.17,00:43:01.17,"It was something that I will never,"
870,00:43:02.73,00:43:02.73,ever be able to describe in enough detail
871,00:43:05.87,00:43:05.87,to give anybody who wasn't here
872,00:43:07.37,00:43:07.37,any idea what it was actually like to be out here.
873,00:43:09.50,00:43:09.50,I've gained some courage and gained some inner strength
874,00:43:12.07,00:43:12.07,"and I'm very, very thankful for that."
875,00:43:14.07,00:43:14.07,It's been something
876,00:43:16.07,00:43:16.07,"that will probably have changed me for the good, I hope."
