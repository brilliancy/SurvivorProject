413,00:18:38.47,00:18:41.03,and either you like meor you don't like me.
414,00:18:41.03,00:18:43.23,It really doesn't weighheavily on my mind.
415,00:18:43.23,00:18:45.67,Going to make two huge S'shere on each side.
416,00:18:45.67,00:18:47.50,- I was worried that Frank
417,00:18:47.50,00:18:49.90,would come backa different person.
418,00:18:49.90,00:18:53.47,That it would really affect himand change him dramatically.
419,00:18:53.47,00:18:55.40,- I can't help it if theselittle liberal special interest
420,00:18:55.40,00:18:57.73,groups that the media giveopen market to...
421,00:18:57.73,00:19:00.93,"- But Frank is Frank, andthree days after he was back,"
422,00:19:00.93,00:19:04.20,I knew he was the same manthat he was when he left.
423,00:19:04.20,00:19:05.80,"- We're going, bud.We're going."
424,00:19:05.80,00:19:07.03,"Let's go home, guys."

426,00:19:10.63,00:19:12.37,"and lovable person,"
427,00:19:12.37,00:19:15.00,and the biggest jerkin the next breath.

439,00:19:37.30,00:19:38.43,Go to work.
440,00:19:38.43,00:19:40.27,Give the man 100%.
441,00:19:40.27,00:19:41.60,He gives you a little bit back.
442,00:19:41.60,00:19:42.97,"And come immediately home,"
443,00:19:42.97,00:19:44.80,and spend time with the family.

448,00:19:56.77,00:19:59.20,that he was actuallygoing to Africa.
449,00:19:59.20,00:20:00.83,"And when Frank left,"
450,00:20:00.83,00:20:04.10,there was something missingin the whole family dynamic.
451,00:20:04.10,00:20:07.03,"What was missing washis enthusiasm for life,"
452,00:20:07.03,00:20:10.47,and his zest for everythingthat he does.
453,00:20:10.47,00:20:11.80,- Very good.
454,00:20:11.80,00:20:13.40,Straight arrow.

571,00:24:31.43,00:24:32.80,"All of a sudden the thongwas out there,"
572,00:24:32.80,00:24:34.57,and the place went crazy.

590,00:25:22.10,00:25:24.33,my priorities straightand that sort of thing.
591,00:25:24.33,00:25:28.57,Coming from Tennesseeto Los Angeles was a huge move.
592,00:25:28.57,00:25:29.90,I'm trying to make itas an actor.

606,00:25:54.83,00:25:57.47,It's that carpe diem mentality.
607,00:26:02.27,00:26:04.30, Survivor helped me in the fact
608,00:26:04.30,00:26:07.00,"that there's an unpredictabilityabout it, you know?"
609,00:26:07.00,00:26:08.27,"- Silas, Teresa, Frank,"

816,00:34:29.13,00:34:32.13,and just thinking how proudthey would be.
817,00:34:35.87,00:34:37.80,"When I was out in Africa,"
818,00:34:37.80,00:34:40.87,I had so much timeto think about family
819,00:34:40.87,00:34:43.47,"and what's really,really important."
820,00:34:43.47,00:34:47.53,♪♪
821,00:34:47.53,00:34:50.70,I started making a mental listin my mind of things
822,00:34:50.70,00:34:54.13,I wanted to changewhen I got back home.
823,00:34:54.13,00:34:57.83,"Reading to the kids more,"
824,00:34:57.83,00:35:00.43,saying their prayers with themat night.
825,00:35:00.43,00:35:03.70,Saying the blessing atthe dinner table every night.
826,00:35:03.70,00:35:06.27,Giving Brian more back rubs.
827,00:35:06.27,00:35:07.73,I might regret saying that.
828,00:35:09.60,00:35:11.77,"- When I was watching her planeto come in,"
829,00:35:11.77,00:35:13.93,"she was the one ofthe last ones to get off,"
830,00:35:13.93,00:35:15.33,"and then when she got off,"
831,00:35:15.33,00:35:17.20,I was the first oneto run up there and hug her.
832,00:35:17.20,00:35:19.20,It felt great.
833,00:35:19.20,00:35:21.17,(laughing)
834,00:35:21.17,00:35:22.57,- As opposed to mejust being...
835,00:35:22.57,00:35:24.73,"being a mom and a good friend,"
836,00:35:24.73,00:35:28.17,"hopefully they'll see meas a role model, and say,"
837,00:35:28.17,00:35:30.33,"""Hey, Mom, that's pretty cool."""
838,00:35:32.30,00:35:33.37,- I'm a city kid.
839,00:35:33.37,00:35:34.63,I've grown up in the city.
840,00:35:34.63,00:35:36.23,The city is where I'm from.
841,00:35:36.23,00:35:39.33,"Before Survivor, I was a financial consultant."
842,00:35:39.33,00:35:41.47,"- Clarence was my stockbroker.- How you doing, Mr. Green?"
843,00:35:41.47,00:35:43.10,"- So we made some investments,"
844,00:35:43.10,00:35:47.57,that we was able to turna profit and open a business...
845,00:35:47.57,00:35:49.73,"- I was, I guess,in that rat race,"
846,00:35:49.73,00:35:52.03,just like everybody else:9:00 to 5:00 job.
847,00:35:52.03,00:35:54.50,It just wasn't for me.
848,00:35:54.50,00:35:56.30,"In my first tripout of the country,"
849,00:35:56.30,00:35:58.80,I'm seeing animals andI'm seeing a way of life
850,00:35:58.80,00:36:00.70,that I...that I can't even conceive of.
851,00:36:00.70,00:36:02.73,"I could still see him, too,I don't want to move."
852,00:36:02.73,00:36:04.40,"It was justan awesome experience,"
853,00:36:04.40,00:36:06.00,"and the food was good, too."
854,00:36:06.00,00:36:08.00,"When I see a gazelle now,I think, like,"
855,00:36:08.00,00:36:09.50,"""Man, you're a goodpiece of meat."""
856,00:36:09.50,00:36:10.83,(laughter)
857,00:36:10.83,00:36:13.77,- Notice how everythingeventually came back to food.
858,00:36:13.77,00:36:16.53,"When they said, ""I thinkClarence took two cherries,"""
859,00:36:16.53,00:36:20.57,"the first thought was, ""Yeah,Clarence took two cherries."""
860,00:36:20.57,00:36:22.00,- I want to be a food critic.
861,00:36:22.00,00:36:23.97,I'm going to be calledthe man's man's food critic.
862,00:36:23.97,00:36:28.07,"All right, we got ourselvessome barbecue, all up in here."
863,00:36:28.07,00:36:29.47,My man doing it up.
864,00:36:29.47,00:36:32.03,"We got some mac and cheese,Greens."
865,00:36:32.03,00:36:33.63,"That's a delicacy there, baby."
866,00:36:33.63,00:36:36.47,If there's one thing beingon Survivor's taught me is--
867,00:36:36.47,00:36:38.10,be yourself.
868,00:36:38.10,00:36:40.67,"I came back feeling like,""Wow, man."
869,00:36:40.67,00:36:43.37,"I've got to come up withsome new goals."""
870,00:36:43.37,00:36:46.40,It made me want to go see moreof these exotic places
871,00:36:46.40,00:36:50.47,that are out thereand not just be a city dweller.
872,00:36:52.10,00:36:54.77,(alarm clock beeping)

874,00:36:57.87,00:36:58.93,it's not a duty.
875,00:36:58.93,00:37:01.83,It's a way of life for me.
876,00:37:01.83,00:37:03.20,I get ready for work.
877,00:37:03.20,00:37:04.80,I always wear makeup.
878,00:37:04.80,00:37:06.87,It makes me feel likeI'm ready for the day.
879,00:37:06.87,00:37:08.13,That's it!
880,00:37:08.13,00:37:10.40,Just enjoying a little bitof downtime before

909,00:38:04.93,00:38:07.13,I think I'ma little more sensitive
910,00:38:07.13,00:38:09.23,than I was before I left.
911,00:38:09.23,00:38:13.50,I don't take anythingfor granted anymore.

952,00:39:45.77,00:39:47.63,I'm in touchwith my feminine side.
953,00:39:47.63,00:39:49.70,- Maybe it's becauseI doted on him so much
954,00:39:49.70,00:39:51.40,after his father died.
955,00:39:51.40,00:39:56.70,"The biggest tragedy in his lifewas when his father died,"
956,00:39:56.70,00:39:59.80,and he was just 14 years old.

962,00:40:15.03,00:40:19.33,11:00 to help get his fatherup the stairs.
963,00:40:19.33,00:40:22.90,"He could be, you know, havingthe best time of his life,"
964,00:40:22.90,00:40:26.43,"but he was home,come 10:30, 11:00."
