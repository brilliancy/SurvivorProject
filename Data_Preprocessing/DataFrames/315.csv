32,00:02:18.30,00:02:18.30,- ...to the revealing...
33,00:02:19.73,00:02:19.73,"- We've seen quite a bit of her, you know,"
34,00:02:21.80,00:02:21.80,more than most son-in-laws
35,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,get to see of their mother-in-law.
36,00:02:23.97,00:02:23.97,- ...to the families they came home to.
37,00:02:27.07,00:02:27.07,"- I cringe a little when one of my friends says,"
38,00:02:29.13,00:02:29.13,"""Oh, your son's really hot!"""
39,00:02:31.43,00:02:31.43,- Every Survivor has a different way of keeping
40,00:02:34.80,00:02:34.80,their memories of the game alive.
41,00:02:36.67,00:02:36.67,"Lex, well, he brought back..."
42,00:02:39.43,00:02:39.43,- A couple of baboon teeth.
43,00:02:41.13,00:02:41.13,- And Kelly?
44,00:02:42.27,00:02:42.27,"- Okay, I stole Clarence's war paint."
45,00:02:45.90,00:02:45.90,- But our journey begins with a man who's picked
46,00:02:48.20,00:02:48.20,a more unusual way to remember his tribe mates.
47,00:02:54.23,00:02:54.23,"- And Kim Johnson, where's that old goat at?"
48,00:02:57.93,00:02:57.93,"Come here, come here, Kim!"

50,00:03:03.93,00:03:03.93,I just put their names on the cattle.
51,00:03:05.97,00:03:05.97,They have some of their characteristics.
52,00:03:09.63,00:03:09.63,"I'm an animal person, and the animals out in Africa"
53,00:03:14.47,00:03:14.47,was probably one of the greatest experiences
54,00:03:17.23,00:03:17.23,I ever had in my life.
55,00:03:19.20,00:03:19.20,There I was sitting right in the middle of Wild Kingdom.
56,00:03:22.43,00:03:22.43,"At 45, I thought I'd done some things"
57,00:03:25.33,00:03:25.33,and I found out I ain't done diddley.
58,00:03:28.03,00:03:28.03,This just shows me that there's more to life then just what's
59,00:03:31.60,00:03:31.60,there around the corner at the house.
60,00:03:33.93,00:03:33.93,(country tune playing)
61,00:03:40.03,00:03:40.03,"I was pretty wild and rusty in my younger days,"
62,00:03:43.40,00:03:43.40,"and I had a pretty big reputation before Survivor come,"
63,00:03:47.73,00:03:47.73,and this just added fuel to the flame.
64,00:03:51.87,00:03:51.87,I like all types of music.
65,00:03:53.53,00:03:53.53,I know about one line of every song.
66,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,"\xe2\x99\xaa Honey, baby, mine... \xe2\x99\xaa"
67,00:03:59.63,00:03:59.63,"I like music, I like to dance."
68,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,"But Bluegrass, I grew up with, I love it."
69,00:04:07.93,00:04:07.93,- Tom has always had the ability
70,00:04:09.73,00:04:09.73,to get along with women.
71,00:04:12.33,00:04:12.33,And I have never seen him meet a woman that he can't talk to.
72,00:04:15.63,00:04:15.63,He's like a magnet.
73,00:04:16.70,00:04:16.70,He's witty and he's a bundle of fun.
74,00:04:21.27,00:04:21.27,(laughing)
75,00:04:27.73,00:04:27.73,- Something that makes me feel vulnerable is spelling.
76,00:04:33.17,00:04:33.17,"Clarence Black, he let the team down."
77,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50,"I couldn't spell ""Clarence,"" I put ""C.B."""
78,00:04:38.27,00:04:38.27,"There I am, 46 years old on national TV and can't spell."
79,00:04:42.87,00:04:42.87,"And I started a little reading program,"
80,00:04:45.73,00:04:45.73,"""Reading is the key to Survival,"" because of that."
81,00:04:48.97,00:04:48.97,How ya'll doing?
82,00:04:50.40,00:04:50.40,"Lookee here, how'd I get him?"
83,00:04:52.27,00:04:52.27,Which one's yours?
84,00:04:53.47,00:04:53.47,"Attaboy, you got a lot of feathers."
85,00:04:56.43,00:04:56.43,- I think he realized right then that he could do something
86,00:04:59.63,00:04:59.63,in our community to really help
87,00:05:02.30,00:05:02.30,to motivate these children to read.
88,00:05:05.43,00:05:05.43,"- If I can help one kid be able to read and spell,"
89,00:05:09.47,00:05:09.47,"if I can help one kid do better than me,"
90,00:05:13.90,00:05:13.90,I'm... I'm glad it embarrassed me.
91,00:05:17.20,00:05:17.20,"Come to daddy, come to daddy."
92,00:05:21.40,00:05:21.40,"I'm still not the sharpest tool in the shed,"
93,00:05:23.80,00:05:23.80,"but I'm still in the shed, and I'm happy to be here."
94,00:05:28.33,00:05:28.33,I'm even more happier than I was before.
95,00:05:36.53,00:05:36.53,"- Since I've been back from Africa,"
96,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,the job market's really tough.
97,00:05:39.90,00:05:39.90,"All right, thank you."
98,00:05:41.43,00:05:41.43,"Taking all these small jobs and I walk someone's dog as well,"
99,00:05:45.43,00:05:45.43,for cash just because I need it.
100,00:05:49.03,00:05:49.03,(dogs barking)
101,00:05:51.77,00:05:51.77,"I'll take up baby-sitting for people,"
102,00:05:54.60,00:05:54.60,moms that I've met at the gym.
103,00:05:58.03,00:05:58.03,- Get off. - You want me to get off?
104,00:06:01.00,00:06:01.00,This was my luxury item that I was able to bring into Africa
105,00:06:03.83,00:06:03.83,with me and this necklace has a very special meaning to me.
106,00:06:08.33,00:06:08.33,It was given to me by my brother.
107,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,And I wore it to Tribal Council every time I went.
108,00:06:12.73,00:06:12.73,It was kind of my security.
109,00:06:14.10,00:06:14.10,I always had my necklace on.
110,00:06:15.50,00:06:15.50,"In 1998, my brother was killed in a very tragic accident."
111,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,"Lex looks a little bit like my brother,"
112,00:06:23.03,00:06:23.03,"so every once in a while,"
113,00:06:24.70,00:06:24.70,"I would kind of get this quick look of Lex and think,"
114,00:06:28.07,00:06:28.07,"""Oh my gosh,"" you know, it looks like him."
115,00:06:30.97,00:06:30.97,And it was just a reminder.
116,00:06:32.30,00:06:32.30,"My brother, he really is here with me."
117,00:06:34.23,00:06:34.23,"He's here, making sure I'm okay."
118,00:06:40.13,00:06:40.13,"It wasn't just about trying to win $1 million,"
119,00:06:42.23,00:06:42.23,and it certainly wasn't about just being on TV.
120,00:06:44.93,00:06:44.93,(cheering)
121,00:06:46.10,00:06:46.10,"To me, it was much more about"
122,00:06:47.33,00:06:47.33,the competition between me and myself.
123,00:06:50.57,00:06:50.57,I have it!
124,00:06:51.83,00:06:51.83,"Big Tom nicknamed me ""Little Bit."""
125,00:06:54.33,00:06:54.33,"He saw me and he thought,"
126,00:06:56.37,00:06:56.37,"""That little bit of a girl"
127,00:06:58.20,00:06:58.20,"is going to make it out here in Africa."""
128,00:07:00.33,00:07:00.33,(bell rings)
129,00:07:01.83,00:07:01.83,"People would keep telling me how small I was,"
130,00:07:03.87,00:07:03.87,and it really angered me.
131,00:07:07.70,00:07:07.70,"I was out there giving 150% of everything I had to say,"
132,00:07:12.03,00:07:12.03,"""You can count on me."
133,00:07:13.33,00:07:13.33,"I can handle this. I'm strong."""
134,00:07:16.93,00:07:16.93,"I took so much away from the game,"
135,00:07:18.70,00:07:18.70,and I learned so much about myself.
136,00:07:20.70,00:07:20.70,There were moments of every single day I spent out there
137,00:07:23.90,00:07:23.90,"that I thought, ""I want to go home,"
138,00:07:25.53,00:07:25.53,"I don't want to play this game anymore."""
139,00:07:27.47,00:07:27.47,- Keep going!
140,00:07:29.77,00:07:29.77,"Kim, it's not over!"
141,00:07:31.47,00:07:31.47,"- But somehow, some, some way,"
142,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,I always pushed through that feeling.
143,00:07:36.80,00:07:36.80,"Come on, Powers."
144,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,"You can do this, Powers."
145,00:07:39.13,00:07:39.13,"Come on, one more, push."
146,00:07:40.60,00:07:40.60,And went on.
147,00:07:42.03,00:07:42.03,And that's the one thing that I... I think I'll probably
148,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,always remember about playing the game was that it was tough
149,00:07:46.93,00:07:46.93,"and it was hard and I wanted to give up, and I never did."
150,00:07:50.03,00:07:50.03,And that's the thing that I'll always draw from.
151,00:08:02.63,00:08:02.63,- \xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa When you're smiling  When you're smiling \xe2\x99\xaa

155,00:08:11.03,00:08:11.03,- One thing about dentistry
156,00:08:12.43,00:08:12.43,"that I really love is that once I step into this role,"
157,00:08:16.97,00:08:16.97,"and I'm working on a patient,"
158,00:08:18.27,00:08:18.27,I don't think about anything else.
159,00:08:19.97,00:08:19.97,"Didn't hurt, did it?"
160,00:08:21.23,00:08:21.23,"Didn't feel a thing, did ya?"
161,00:08:22.80,00:08:22.80,"Saw patients all day, worked all day,"
162,00:08:25.07,00:08:25.07,"jump in the car, I'll put the top down,"
163,00:08:27.10,00:08:27.10,put some tunes on and cruise on home.
164,00:08:32.73,00:08:32.73,- What do you drive?
165,00:08:33.77,00:08:33.77,- You don't want to know what I drive.
166,00:08:34.80,00:08:34.80,"- Yes, we do, yes, I do."
167,00:08:35.97,00:08:35.97,"- No, you don't want to know what I drive."
168,00:08:37.17,00:08:37.17,"- Aw, tell me, Doc. - I'm not telling."
169,00:08:39.40,00:08:39.40,- The question came up about what kind of car I drive
170,00:08:41.27,00:08:41.27,and what kind of lifestyle I had.
171,00:08:42.90,00:08:42.90,"I already knew that Silas was trying to put in play,"
172,00:08:45.20,00:08:45.20,"""Here's a guy who doesn't need the million dollars."""
173,00:08:48.73,00:08:48.73,- Doc getting out all his...
174,00:08:50.43,00:08:50.43,all his valuables and all his money.
175,00:08:52.23,00:08:52.23,- Mercedes! - I have one of those.
176,00:08:54.37,00:08:54.37,- What else?
177,00:08:56.03,00:08:56.03,- What do they say?
178,00:08:58.03,00:08:58.03,"""Little boys grow up to be men with bigger toys."""
179,00:09:00.50,00:09:00.50,"It's definitely true, I like my toys."
180,00:09:02.93,00:09:02.93,- A Porsche. A Porsche.
181,00:09:04.17,00:09:04.17,You have a Porsche.
182,00:09:05.47,00:09:05.47,"- I drive a Porsche, pardon me, you know what I mean."
183,00:09:08.60,00:09:08.60,"I've worked my entire life to get to this level, you know."
184,00:09:11.73,00:09:11.73,I'm not embarrassed of that.
185,00:09:12.77,00:09:12.77,That's the American dream.
186,00:09:13.80,00:09:13.80,That's what defines America.
187,00:09:15.17,00:09:15.17,I feel I epitomize the American dream in my own right.
188,00:09:18.83,00:09:18.83,"12 years old, I remember reading Disney's autobiography,"
189,00:09:21.50,00:09:21.50,"and he had a little quote in there that said,"
190,00:09:23.40,00:09:23.40,"""If you can dream it, you can do it."""
191,00:09:24.80,00:09:24.80,And I live that way.
192,00:09:26.37,00:09:26.37,I dream... I dreamed that I would be on Survivor no problem.
193,00:09:29.13,00:09:29.13,That experience in Africa definitely changed me.
194,00:09:34.23,00:09:34.23,"Look, I'm the old guy, okay,"
195,00:09:36.20,00:09:36.20,but I know what needs to be done.
196,00:09:37.27,00:09:37.27,"Every morning-- fire, water and food."
197,00:09:39.53,00:09:39.53,"Well, of course, I went to get the water"
198,00:09:41.17,00:09:41.17,because if I don't get it it's not going to get done.
199,00:09:43.13,00:09:43.13,You think anybody else gets off their ass to do anything.

205,00:09:54.60,00:09:54.60,"two and a half months and not having family there,"
206,00:09:57.57,00:09:57.57,"it's changed him a lot,"
207,00:09:59.17,00:09:59.17,and he's more willing to listen to people.
208,00:10:01.60,00:10:01.60,"- My wife said she should have sent me 20 years ago,"
209,00:10:03.30,00:10:03.30,made me a nicer person.
210,00:10:05.13,00:10:05.13,"- He seems genuinely sweeter, kinder."
211,00:10:09.10,00:10:09.10,"I think he really missed me a lot, and his actions show it."
212,00:10:14.97,00:10:14.97,- Life is fun and you don't know what tomorrow's going to bring.
213,00:10:17.67,00:10:17.67,"So, go for it."
214,00:10:19.10,00:10:19.10,"If you shoot for the stars, if you miss,"

218,00:10:29.10,00:10:29.10,"- The most embarrassing moment of my life, by far."
219,00:10:31.77,00:10:31.77,- And Survivor's  most colorful castaway.
220,00:10:36.60,00:10:36.60,- I got my Catholic schoolgirl.
221,00:10:42.97,00:10:42.97,- Survivor has a way of making strange bedfellows.
222,00:10:46.60,00:10:46.60,"In our next group, one old-fashioned guy,"
223,00:10:49.67,00:10:49.67,"two strong-willed women,"
224,00:10:51.53,00:10:51.53,and someone who clearly is a different drummer.
225,00:10:55.57,00:10:55.57,"- One, two, three, four."

228,00:11:04.03,00:11:04.03,"I had a good life, don't get me wrong."
229,00:11:05.43,00:11:05.43,"I spent about ten, 12 years working in"
230,00:11:07.27,00:11:07.27,"the high-tech industry, surfing with my buddies,"
231,00:11:10.13,00:11:10.13,and going out catching a good surf.
232,00:11:11.70,00:11:11.70,But I never felt like I was really cut out
233,00:11:14.07,00:11:14.07,for that kind of ordinary life.
234,00:11:17.20,00:11:17.20,Cool.
235,00:11:18.83,00:11:18.83,I've got some good tattoos.
236,00:11:20.10,00:11:20.10,"I've got my devil head, Catholic schoolgirl,"

238,00:11:24.13,00:11:24.13,"Obviously, my wife and my kids, huge part of my life."
239,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,My very favorite tattoos are the ones my boys drew for me.
240,00:11:30.60,00:11:30.60,It's actually a drawing of me.
241,00:11:33.33,00:11:33.33,"I've got my boy's names: Corbin Ace Daniel,"
242,00:11:34.77,00:11:34.77,River's name is right here.
243,00:11:36.20,00:11:36.20,"When I got back from Africa,"
244,00:11:37.53,00:11:37.53,I actually celebrated my ten-year wedding anniversary.
245,00:11:40.27,00:11:40.27,"My wife and I both got wedding anniversary tattoos, you know,"
246,00:11:43.63,00:11:43.63,ten years on the dice there.
247,00:11:44.97,00:11:44.97,"My wife actually got one as well, right there."
248,00:11:47.50,00:11:47.50,We're freaks.
249,00:11:50.57,00:11:50.57,"I recall coming home, seeing my wife and kids,"
250,00:11:53.03,00:11:53.03,being just so stoked about seeing them.
251,00:11:58.27,00:11:58.27,"Of course, my luxury item."
252,00:11:59.63,00:11:59.63,"They're these shoes,"
253,00:12:01.00,00:12:01.00,they have now taken a special place in my home.
254,00:12:03.47,00:12:03.47,They'll always hang out with my Survivor stuff now.
255,00:12:06.43,00:12:06.43,"Hey, River, do you remember these?"
256,00:12:07.73,00:12:07.73,- Yeah. - You wore these.
257,00:12:09.43,00:12:09.43,You learned to walk in these shoes.
258,00:12:11.07,00:12:11.07,- I know. - Yeah.
259,00:12:12.50,00:12:12.50,Really the only thing that has ever really been important
260,00:12:14.43,00:12:14.43,to me has been my family and my friends.

264,00:12:24.27,00:12:24.27,We play here in Santa Cruz-- all original music.
265,00:12:27.03,00:12:27.03,We have such a good time doing it.
266,00:12:29.17,00:12:29.17,It's always been a huge part of my life.
267,00:12:32.73,00:12:32.73,(laughing)
268,00:12:37.23,00:12:37.23,Africa is... is nothing like the States.
269,00:12:40.23,00:12:40.23,You might as well have taken 16 of us and dropped us
270,00:12:42.13,00:12:42.13,on Mars or on the moon.
271,00:12:45.77,00:12:45.77,I didn't anticipate that it was really going to be quite as
272,00:12:48.13,00:12:48.13,dangerous as it was.
273,00:12:50.07,00:12:50.07,"I thought to myself,"

275,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,but they're obviously not going to put us in harm's way.

281,00:13:03.00,00:13:03.00,He's right outside the fence.
282,00:13:04.33,00:13:04.33,(growling)
283,00:13:07.70,00:13:07.70,- The drinking water.

285,00:13:12.60,00:13:12.60,"at the spring,"
286,00:13:13.90,00:13:13.90,expecting that it's going to be something pretty safe.
287,00:13:16.90,00:13:16.90,This is mud.
288,00:13:17.93,00:13:17.93,I came home pretty sick.
289,00:13:20.50,00:13:20.50,The first three weeks back here was spent pretty much
290,00:13:22.63,00:13:22.63,just doing a lot of this.
291,00:13:24.33,00:13:24.33,My doctor found no less than four different parasites
292,00:13:27.10,00:13:27.10,and a couple of different bacteria.
293,00:13:30.03,00:13:30.03,"I have to take so many pills, probably like almost a dozen."
294,00:13:33.30,00:13:33.30,I'm still dealing with the results of being out there
295,00:13:37.50,00:13:37.50,"in a dangerous, hazardous, very real place."
296,00:13:42.10,00:13:42.10,"Almost the first question I'm always asked by people is,"

298,00:13:48.97,00:13:48.97,And I had the time of my life
299,00:13:51.33,00:13:51.33,and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

302,00:14:01.83,00:14:01.83, going to Kenya for seven weeks this summer
303,00:14:04.67,00:14:04.67,"was extremely meaningful, very important to me."
304,00:14:08.43,00:14:08.43,This place can just... can just fill our spirits!
305,00:14:12.13,00:14:12.13,I don't know if they're spirits or what.
306,00:14:14.30,00:14:14.30,I just feel very protected in Africa.
307,00:14:17.60,00:14:17.60,Life is different now for me.
308,00:14:19.90,00:14:19.90,I'm still the same person.

310,00:14:23.57,00:14:23.57,But there's definitely been a transformation.
311,00:14:25.87,00:14:25.87,I think I'm calmer.
312,00:14:27.27,00:14:27.27,I think I'm more focused now
313,00:14:28.90,00:14:28.90,in terms of what's really important in life:

317,00:14:37.07,00:14:37.07,that she wanted to do   Survivor.
318,00:14:38.87,00:14:38.87,I've seen her passions escalate from race walking
319,00:14:41.43,00:14:41.43,"to roller blading to mountain climbing, now yoga."
320,00:14:47.10,00:14:47.10,"When she gets an interest,"
321,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,she gets very passionate about it.
322,00:14:53.30,00:14:53.30,"- Once I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer,"
323,00:14:55.87,00:14:55.87,"when I heard those words, ""You have cancer,"""
324,00:14:57.63,00:14:57.63,I felt like my life was spinning out of control.
325,00:15:00.17,00:15:00.17,"It was soon after, very soon after,"
326,00:15:02.47,00:15:02.47,that I decided to climb Mount Rainier.
327,00:15:05.67,00:15:05.67,And each time I take a trip
328,00:15:07.87,00:15:07.87,it's not about reaching the summit.
329,00:15:09.23,00:15:09.23,It's not the destination.
330,00:15:10.30,00:15:10.30,It's about the journey.
331,00:15:11.70,00:15:11.70,So it's really a metaphor for how I try to live my life.
332,00:15:24.00,00:15:24.00,- She always has a positive attitude and she's always
333,00:15:26.73,00:15:26.73,"telling me, ""Go for your dreams."""

341,00:15:49.53,00:15:49.53,That life is the ultimate adventure.
342,00:15:52.00,00:15:52.00,"If you have a dream, you have a goal,"
343,00:15:54.93,00:15:54.93,"you have a desire, go for it!"
344,00:16:02.77,00:16:02.77,- Woo!
345,00:16:04.70,00:16:04.70,I was at a point in my life I think where

359,00:16:37.67,00:16:37.67,That kind of sums up her personality.
360,00:16:40.30,00:16:40.30,- Competitive.

400,00:18:05.40,00:18:05.40,This show just... just boosted me up in maturity
401,00:18:08.43,00:18:08.43,a little bit more.

403,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,It wasn't positive seeing some of the ways
404,00:18:13.47,00:18:13.47,I handled situations.
405,00:18:14.70,00:18:14.70,"- Lindsey, have you made any mistakes so far?"
406,00:18:17.57,00:18:17.57,- I'm a walking mistake.
407,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,I think I grew a lot from it.
408,00:18:20.80,00:18:20.80,"- Lindsey, would you go boil some water for us please?"
409,00:18:22.77,00:18:22.77,(laughter)
410,00:18:30.60,00:18:30.60,"- What you saw on Survivor  was... was me, the real deal."
411,00:18:33.50,00:18:33.50,"No, just go!"
412,00:18:35.00,00:18:35.00,Just come around the corner.
413,00:18:36.57,00:18:36.57,"You know, Frank Garrison is not going to change,"
414,00:18:38.47,00:18:38.47,and either you like me or you don't like me.
415,00:18:41.03,00:18:41.03,It really doesn't weigh heavily on my mind.
416,00:18:43.23,00:18:43.23,Going to make two huge S's here on each side.
417,00:18:45.67,00:18:45.67,- I was worried that Frank
418,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,would come back a different person.
419,00:18:49.90,00:18:49.90,That it would really affect him and change him dramatically.
420,00:18:53.47,00:18:53.47,- I can't help it if these little liberal special interest
421,00:18:55.40,00:18:55.40,groups that the media give open market to...
422,00:18:57.73,00:18:57.73,"- But Frank is Frank, and three days after he was back,"
423,00:19:00.93,00:19:00.93,I knew he was the same man that he was when he left.
424,00:19:04.20,00:19:04.20,"- We're going, bud. We're going."
425,00:19:05.80,00:19:05.80,"Let's go home, guys."
426,00:19:07.03,00:19:07.03,"- Frank can be the most charming, sweet,"
427,00:19:10.63,00:19:10.63,"and lovable person,"
428,00:19:12.37,00:19:12.37,and the biggest jerk in the next breath.
429,00:19:15.00,00:19:15.00,- Let's just get moving along.
430,00:19:16.43,00:19:16.43,(beeping)
431,00:19:18.20,00:19:18.20,"Jocelyn Rose up and at them, let's go!"
432,00:19:21.57,00:19:21.57,"Come on, guys."
433,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40,"- Frank, we just hit the snooze button."
434,00:19:26.97,00:19:26.97,- My life's philosophy in general is to get up early
435,00:19:29.70,00:19:29.70,in the morning.
436,00:19:30.90,00:19:30.90,"Okay, can I have a kiss?"
437,00:19:33.30,00:19:33.30,I love you!
438,00:19:34.43,00:19:34.43,Kiss your wife and children.
439,00:19:35.53,00:19:35.53,"See you later, alligator!"
440,00:19:37.30,00:19:37.30,Go to work.
441,00:19:38.43,00:19:38.43,Give the man 100%.
442,00:19:40.27,00:19:40.27,He gives you a little bit back.
443,00:19:41.60,00:19:41.60,"And come immediately home,"
444,00:19:42.97,00:19:42.97,and spend time with the family.
445,00:19:44.80,00:19:44.80,- He's a very loving father.
446,00:19:48.37,00:19:48.37,- Would you like a cup of coffee?
447,00:19:50.70,00:19:50.70,- And a very loving husband.
448,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,We found out I was pregnant the day before we got the call
449,00:19:56.77,00:19:56.77,that he was actually going to Africa.
450,00:19:59.20,00:19:59.20,"And when Frank left,"
451,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,there was something missing in the whole family dynamic.
452,00:20:04.10,00:20:04.10,"What was missing was his enthusiasm for life,"
453,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,and his zest for everything that he does.
454,00:20:10.47,00:20:10.47,- Very good.
455,00:20:11.80,00:20:11.80,Straight arrow.
456,00:20:13.40,00:20:13.40,See how nice and straight that went?
457,00:20:14.63,00:20:14.63,"- When I think of my dad, I think of hugging."
458,00:20:19.10,00:20:19.10,I think of sharing...
459,00:20:21.27,00:20:21.27,"- Yes, ma'am. - Here you go."
460,00:20:23.23,00:20:23.23,- ...I think of being a leader.
461,00:20:24.70,00:20:24.70,- Samburu!
462,00:20:30.70,00:20:30.70,- The things that were important to me prior
463,00:20:32.80,00:20:32.80,to Survivor are the same things that are important to me now:
464,00:20:35.33,00:20:35.33,"providing my family with the basics of food, shelter,"
465,00:20:38.97,00:20:38.97,"and security, but most importantly, love."
466,00:20:43.77,00:20:43.77,"(Probst) - Coming up,"
467,00:20:44.83,00:20:44.83,we go hot tubbing with Mama Kim
468,00:20:48.13,00:20:48.13,and mud-slinging with just about everybody.
469,00:20:51.47,00:20:51.47,"- Clarence, I just didn't like him worth snot."
470,00:21:00.50,00:21:00.50,- Welcome back.
471,00:21:01.87,00:21:01.87,"Well, at the end of every Tribal Council,"
472,00:21:03.57,00:21:03.57,the person voted out has to leave immediately.
473,00:21:06.77,00:21:06.77,"Once the tribe has spoken, the departing Survivor can't."
474,00:21:10.83,00:21:10.83,So we decided to give them a chance for a parting shot.
475,00:21:15.13,00:21:15.13,- Clarence Black.
476,00:21:16.63,00:21:16.63,"- Oh, Clarence."
477,00:21:18.20,00:21:18.20,- Loves to talk about himself.
478,00:21:20.23,00:21:20.23,"- Like him a lot, he's my favorite."
479,00:21:21.70,00:21:21.70,(cheering)
480,00:21:22.90,00:21:22.90,- I just didn't like him worth snot.
481,00:21:25.10,00:21:25.10,- (laughing)
482,00:21:26.40,00:21:26.40,"- Kelly Goldsmith, off with her head."
483,00:21:28.63,00:21:28.63,- Woo!
484,00:21:29.77,00:21:29.77,- Cut it right off.
485,00:21:30.93,00:21:30.93,"- Lex, eccentric."
486,00:21:33.67,00:21:33.67,- Lex is like a 16 year old living in a 40 year old's body.
487,00:21:36.37,00:21:36.37,- Eh.
488,00:21:37.47,00:21:37.47,- Lindsey Richter. - A bit of a whiner.
489,00:21:40.03,00:21:40.03,- Emotional. - Emotional.
490,00:21:41.10,00:21:41.10,- Emotional.
491,00:21:42.13,00:21:42.13,- You're sweet.
492,00:21:43.30,00:21:43.30,"You were in over your head, though, sweetie."
493,00:21:44.77,00:21:44.77,- Okay.
494,00:21:46.43,00:21:46.43,- Tom. - Yeah.
495,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50,"- A dirty, old pervert that I love."
496,00:21:50.27,00:21:50.27,- Good ole... - Country boy.
497,00:21:52.00,00:21:52.00,"- It's a sickness, it's a sickness."
498,00:21:53.67,00:21:53.67,- Silas Gaither.
499,00:21:54.80,00:21:54.80,- That smile could knock your socks off.
500,00:21:57.10,00:21:57.10,- You love yourself.
501,00:21:58.37,00:21:58.37,- Ethan Zohn. Quiet.
502,00:22:00.47,00:22:00.47,(sighs)
503,00:22:02.53,00:22:02.53,"- Super sweet guy, shy."
504,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,- Um...
505,00:22:06.97,00:22:06.97,- Mr. Lovable. - Great hair.
506,00:22:11.50,00:22:11.50,- Frank. - Frankie.
507,00:22:12.87,00:22:12.87,- Hardcore. - Green beret.
508,00:22:14.43,00:22:14.43,- Trying to be sensitive here.
509,00:22:15.80,00:22:15.80,- Frank and his deer antlers.
510,00:22:18.50,00:22:18.50,- Brandon...
511,00:22:21.93,00:22:21.93,in a different world.
512,00:22:23.23,00:22:23.23,"- Good job, Frank."
513,00:22:24.50,00:22:24.50,"- Jessie, what a woman."
514,00:22:26.43,00:22:26.43,- Me? - Hot.
515,00:22:28.13,00:22:28.13,(laughs)
516,00:22:30.00,00:22:30.00,- Kim Johnson.
517,00:22:31.37,00:22:31.37,"- Wait a minute, let me think on this one."
518,00:22:32.93,00:22:32.93,Dear God.
519,00:22:33.97,00:22:33.97,- Probably be clever.
520,00:22:35.70,00:22:35.70,- Honest.
521,00:22:37.10,00:22:37.10,"Like my mom, I got along with her great."
522,00:22:48.77,00:22:48.77,- There's nothing more important to me in my life
523,00:22:50.53,00:22:50.53,than my family.
524,00:22:51.70,00:22:51.70,"I've got three kids, all married,"
525,00:22:54.67,00:22:54.67,"three grandchildren, one on the way."
526,00:22:56.83,00:22:56.83,It doesn't get much better than that.
527,00:22:59.40,00:22:59.40,- Hello there.
528,00:23:00.60,00:23:00.60,- My oldest child is Wendy.
529,00:23:02.67,00:23:02.67,Wendy and her family only live four miles from me.
530,00:23:05.50,00:23:05.50,"Hello, hey, love!"
531,00:23:07.23,00:23:07.23,Yeah.
532,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,"Our son, Teddy, just got married two weeks after I got home"
533,00:23:11.20,00:23:11.20,from Africa.
534,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,"My middle child, Kerry,"
535,00:23:15.10,00:23:15.10,just had the most beautiful baby boy.
536,00:23:18.17,00:23:18.17,"We spend as much time as we can with them,"
537,00:23:20.13,00:23:20.13,"where they live in Durango, Colorado."
538,00:23:23.67,00:23:23.67,Growing up was... was tough.
539,00:23:25.57,00:23:25.57,It was really just my mom and myself.
540,00:23:27.57,00:23:27.57,I was really more the mom.
541,00:23:28.87,00:23:28.87,"We had a lot of problems-- health-wise, money-wise,"
542,00:23:32.03,00:23:32.03,every-wise.
543,00:23:33.57,00:23:33.57,I never really had a warm and loving relationship
544,00:23:36.57,00:23:36.57,until my husband.
545,00:23:38.50,00:23:38.50,"Come on, Sierra."
546,00:23:39.60,00:23:39.60,Ted and I met when we were in college.
547,00:23:41.73,00:23:41.73,He's been my best friend ever since.
548,00:23:44.73,00:23:44.73,- Kim was 19 when we got married.
549,00:23:46.47,00:23:46.47,"The way she grew up,"
550,00:23:48.37,00:23:48.37,it gave her the resolve to really put her
551,00:23:51.60,00:23:51.60,all into making everything work.
552,00:23:53.37,00:23:53.37,- We've really helped keep each other young.
553,00:23:55.93,00:23:55.93,"I probably do look like a grandmother,"
554,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,but I don't think most of the time
555,00:23:59.37,00:23:59.37,I act like a grandmother.
556,00:24:02.37,00:24:02.37,"- When she gets her mind made up on something,"
557,00:24:04.50,00:24:04.50,there's just no stopping her.
558,00:24:06.67,00:24:06.67,"- At my age, which is 57-- ouch-- my life is..."
559,00:24:11.23,00:24:11.23,is pretty much set.
560,00:24:12.60,00:24:12.60,I'm not going to go out in the street
561,00:24:13.73,00:24:13.73,"and hang out with a guy full of tattoos and say,"
562,00:24:14.90,00:24:14.90,"""Hey, what's your life like?"""
563,00:24:16.73,00:24:16.73,Yes!
564,00:24:17.87,00:24:17.87,It was so cool to be able to spend time
565,00:24:19.63,00:24:19.63,with people different from me.
566,00:24:22.03,00:24:22.03,As far as the thong thing goes...
567,00:24:23.57,00:24:23.57,"- Whoa, man!"
568,00:24:24.83,00:24:24.83,- I didn't go there with the idea of taking off my pants.
569,00:24:27.00,00:24:27.00,- Women in her thong there.
570,00:24:28.73,00:24:28.73,- We had people over in our apartment
571,00:24:29.90,00:24:29.90,and then they showed scenes from next week.
572,00:24:31.43,00:24:31.43,"All of a sudden the thong was out there,"
573,00:24:32.80,00:24:32.80,and the place went crazy.
574,00:24:34.57,00:24:34.57,- Anything to get this challenge.
575,00:24:36.17,00:24:36.17,"- We've seen quite a bit of her,"
576,00:24:37.33,00:24:37.33,more than most son-in-laws
577,00:24:38.33,00:24:38.33,"get to see of their mother-in- law,"
578,00:24:40.03,00:24:40.03,"so that's... that's been a big plus, too."
579,00:24:41.60,00:24:41.60,- You and the whole town.
580,00:24:42.80,00:24:42.80,"- Yeah, well, and all our friends."
581,00:24:44.70,00:24:44.70,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
582,00:24:47.10,00:24:47.10,- I came away from this experience
583,00:24:49.40,00:24:49.40,with a reaffirmation of my ability to do
584,00:24:55.20,00:24:55.20,what I want to do when I want to do it.
585,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,It's probably the coolest thing I've ever done.
586,00:25:09.83,00:25:09.83,"- Every day, I like to basically start with a devotion."
587,00:25:13.27,00:25:13.27,"""For God so loved the world that he gave his only son."""
588,00:25:16.63,00:25:16.63,I focus on the day ahead and...
589,00:25:18.20,00:25:18.20,"and, you know, I read a chapter from the Bible a day,"
590,00:25:20.87,00:25:20.87,"and it just kind of gets, you know,"
591,00:25:22.10,00:25:22.10,my priorities straight and that sort of thing.
592,00:25:24.33,00:25:24.33,Coming from Tennessee to Los Angeles was a huge move.
593,00:25:28.57,00:25:28.57,I'm trying to make it as an actor.
594,00:25:29.90,00:25:29.90,"And I try to read a script a day,"
595,00:25:32.10,00:25:32.10,and bartending to make ends meet.
596,00:25:33.73,00:25:33.73,It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.
597,00:25:35.47,00:25:35.47,This is the green machine.
598,00:25:37.37,00:25:37.37,"But, man, I absolutely love it here."
599,00:25:39.53,00:25:39.53,"The beach, man."
600,00:25:40.53,00:25:40.53,The temperature is perfect.
601,00:25:41.77,00:25:41.77,Welcome to sunny California.
602,00:25:43.77,00:25:43.77,The sun's shining bright.
603,00:25:45.33,00:25:45.33,"I mean, it's just absolutely amazing."
604,00:25:47.70,00:25:47.70,You ready to rock?
605,00:25:50.63,00:25:50.63,"You know, depending on the day,"
606,00:25:51.87,00:25:51.87,I try to knock in a good day of surfing.
607,00:25:54.83,00:25:54.83,It's that carpe diem mentality.
608,00:26:02.27,00:26:02.27, Survivor helped me in the fact
609,00:26:04.30,00:26:04.30,"that there's an unpredictability about it, you know?"
610,00:26:07.00,00:26:07.00,"- Silas, Teresa, Frank,"
611,00:26:08.27,00:26:08.27,you guys are now members of Boran.
612,00:26:10.13,00:26:10.13,- The switch meant the game for me.
613,00:26:12.10,00:26:12.10,Smokes.
614,00:26:13.50,00:26:13.50,I never saw that coming.
615,00:26:14.90,00:26:14.90,"Right when I got kicked off, I couldn't sleep for a week!"
616,00:26:17.57,00:26:17.57,"Just now, I mean, I'm finally starting to forget and relax"
617,00:26:20.70,00:26:20.70,"and just, you know, really come down from it."
618,00:26:22.87,00:26:22.87,"You know, it's funny when you're in Africa, it's a place to,"
619,00:26:26.27,00:26:26.27,"like, really think about life and think about"
620,00:26:29.07,00:26:29.07,the importance of life and like what we live for.
621,00:26:31.63,00:26:31.63,"If you were going to die tomorrow,"
622,00:26:33.60,00:26:33.60,"it's relationships,"
623,00:26:34.97,00:26:34.97,and the relationship that I have with God and my family
624,00:26:38.80,00:26:38.80,"and friends and loved ones, man."
625,00:26:40.40,00:26:40.40,"I mean, that's, to me,"
626,00:26:41.43,00:26:41.43,that's the most important thing in life.
627,00:26:44.20,00:26:44.20,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
628,00:26:48.77,00:26:48.77,- I love proving people wrong.
629,00:26:51.43,00:26:51.43,I think that's my thing.
630,00:26:53.53,00:26:53.53,Men that say that women can't do the same thing that men can do.
631,00:26:55.90,00:26:55.90,"Well, guess what?"
632,00:26:58.23,00:26:58.23,I love proving men wrong.
633,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,(gunshots)
634,00:27:03.97,00:27:03.97,The reason why I love police work is because
635,00:27:06.23,00:27:06.23,it's a job where you can do something about society.
636,00:27:10.97,00:27:10.97,"My grandpa was a cop in Puerto Rico, retired 25 years."
637,00:27:14.63,00:27:14.63,I've heard all the stories.
638,00:27:16.60,00:27:16.60,I just fell in love with it.
639,00:27:18.23,00:27:18.23,"Now I'm working for the Sheriff's Department,"
640,00:27:19.33,00:27:19.33,and I love it.
641,00:27:21.63,00:27:21.63,"- She's a good cop, good cop."
642,00:27:26.60,00:27:26.60,"- Behind the cop,"
643,00:27:28.23,00:27:28.23,I am probably the coolest chick you'll ever know.
644,00:27:31.57,00:27:31.57,"No, no, no."
645,00:27:32.87,00:27:32.87,I'm a big kid at heart.
646,00:27:34.33,00:27:34.33,I like to do spontaneous things.
647,00:27:36.90,00:27:36.90,Boxing is a good stress reliever.
648,00:27:40.20,00:27:40.20,"Your only concentration is on trying to get that person,"
649,00:27:42.73,00:27:42.73,and try to hit 'em and knock 'em out.
650,00:27:44.00,00:27:44.00,It's fun.
651,00:27:46.03,00:27:46.03,My sister was the one that made me do Survivor.
652,00:27:51.20,00:27:51.20,- She's a tough girl.
653,00:27:53.97,00:27:53.97,- Survivor in Africa was so much tougher
654,00:27:56.90,00:27:56.90,than I thought it would be.
655,00:27:58.33,00:27:58.33,I never expected the water conditions to be so bad.
656,00:28:02.23,00:28:02.23,"- Throwing up when you have so little hydration to go around,"
657,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,"it's bad for her, it's bad for us."
658,00:28:07.43,00:28:07.43,"- Jessie, the tribe has spoken."
659,00:28:09.90,00:28:09.90,"- When I was voted off and I thought,"
660,00:28:11.10,00:28:11.10,"""Wow, you know, I just disappointed my sister."""
661,00:28:18.63,00:28:18.63,"Once the show was over,"
662,00:28:21.03,00:28:21.03,"I actually stayed an extra month in Africa,"
663,00:28:23.43,00:28:23.43,"and helped out in the community project,"
664,00:28:26.70,00:28:26.70,"building a lodge, working with the Masai."
665,00:28:30.33,00:28:30.33,Working with them was excellent.
666,00:28:32.27,00:28:32.27,"I mean, it was such a great experience."
667,00:28:34.60,00:28:34.60,"And I don't think I'll ever, ever, ever forget that."
668,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,"- Brandon was the hottest,"
669,00:28:41.97,00:28:41.97,"sexiest, smartest guy on Survivor."
670,00:28:44.23,00:28:44.23,Aah!
671,00:28:45.27,00:28:45.27,I know he didn't look like it.
672,00:28:46.73,00:28:46.73,Sorry.
673,00:28:47.80,00:28:47.80,"But Brandon was the bomb, uh-huh."
674,00:28:50.33,00:28:50.33,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
675,00:28:53.33,00:28:53.33,I got a date with Frank! I got a date with Frank!
676,00:28:56.27,00:28:56.27,"I may have had my outlandish moments,"
677,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,"but I was secure enough to be on a hit show,"
678,00:29:02.77,00:29:02.77,"proclaiming that I was gay,"
679,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,and it didn't bother me if everybody knew it.
680,00:29:06.23,00:29:06.23,"- Are you gay? - Uh-huh, I am."
681,00:29:08.73,00:29:08.73,They put me with people that they suspected would dislike me
682,00:29:11.07,00:29:11.07,for that very reason.
683,00:29:12.40,00:29:12.40,- Brandon would be the last person on earth
684,00:29:13.63,00:29:13.63,I would pick.
685,00:29:15.07,00:29:15.07,- You know what? I got along with them all very well.
686,00:29:17.20,00:29:17.20,"- Go, Brandon!"
687,00:29:18.30,00:29:18.30,- I'm not a very good bartender.
688,00:29:20.10,00:29:20.10,"And when I first started, I used to tell people,"
689,00:29:22.43,00:29:22.43,you didn't come because
690,00:29:23.50,00:29:23.50,you thought I'd make a good drink.
691,00:29:24.97,00:29:24.97,I always look good.
692,00:29:26.43,00:29:26.43,- Brandon's skills as a bartender sometimes
693,00:29:28.57,00:29:28.57,leave a lot to be desired.
694,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,What he serves best is the attitude.
695,00:29:31.97,00:29:31.97,- What do you want? - A drink!
696,00:29:33.33,00:29:33.33,"- I work in the leather bar-- big, burly guys,"
697,00:29:36.17,00:29:36.17,and I'm not that.
698,00:29:37.57,00:29:37.57,I'm just a little almost-used- to-be-chicken kind of guy.
699,00:29:42.40,00:29:42.40,I had never gone camping.
700,00:29:45.47,00:29:45.47,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
701,00:29:47.83,00:29:47.83,First time I ever slept in a camping situation
702,00:29:51.23,00:29:51.23,was my first night in Africa under those stars.
703,00:29:54.13,00:29:54.13,"Oh, my goodness!"
704,00:29:55.60,00:29:55.60,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
705,00:29:58.03,00:29:58.03,It made me realize that I really can do anything
706,00:29:59.77,00:29:59.77,if I set my mind to it.
707,00:30:01.17,00:30:01.17,"C'mon, dude, let's go!"
708,00:30:02.43,00:30:02.43,- Brandon always said the reason he wanted to be
709,00:30:03.43,00:30:03.43,on Survivor was because
710,00:30:04.73,00:30:04.73,there was no one on TV that he felt portrayed him.
711,00:30:07.30,00:30:07.30,I think he wanted to show America a gay man in their
712,00:30:11.50,00:30:11.50,middle 20s who's getting out on his own
713,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83,and finding his way and coming to grow as a person.
714,00:30:16.50,00:30:16.50,- To Brandon!
715,00:30:20.50,00:30:20.50,- The Walt Whitman School is for gay and lesbian teenagers
716,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,who have been tormented in their schools and abused.
717,00:30:27.37,00:30:27.37,- How did the other tribe members feel about you
718,00:30:29.13,00:30:29.13,being a homosexual?
719,00:30:30.30,00:30:30.30,- I'm just a normal gay person.
720,00:30:32.03,00:30:32.03,Some of those kids might see me and maybe take
721,00:30:33.83,00:30:33.83,"a little inspiration,"
722,00:30:35.30,00:30:35.30,and that makes me feel very good.
723,00:30:37.37,00:30:37.37,"Just because I'm gay, don't assume certain things about me."
724,00:30:41.03,00:30:41.03,You just never know what kind of person you're dealing with
725,00:30:45.13,00:30:45.13,until you get to know them.
726,00:30:46.70,00:30:46.70,And that's really all I want to say.
727,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,"(Probst) - When we come back,"
728,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,"she's hard-driving, yet soft."
729,00:30:54.53,00:30:54.53,- Are you calling me schizophrenic?
730,00:30:55.83,00:30:55.83,"- And later, the softer side of the hard-driving guy"
731,00:30:59.00,00:30:59.00,who won it all.
732,00:31:00.20,00:31:00.20,- I'm in touch with my feminine side.
733,00:31:05.03,00:31:05.03,- Her fellow Survivors
734,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,called her the smartest girl out there.
735,00:31:08.27,00:31:08.27,She says she's just a homebody with a wild streak
736,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,learning to live in L.A.
737,00:31:13.97,00:31:13.97,- From the beginning... - Go!
738,00:31:16.27,00:31:16.27,- I was out-manned by everybody.
739,00:31:17.70,00:31:17.70,I thought I was going to pass out.
740,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,I felt like I was the worst athlete there.
741,00:31:20.63,00:31:20.63,Ow!
742,00:31:22.23,00:31:22.23,I thought I was definitely the first person voted off.
743,00:31:25.07,00:31:25.07,But the snake pit that is Survivor...
744,00:31:27.10,00:31:27.10,- We cut Kelly off tonight.
745,00:31:29.03,00:31:29.03,We take her out.
746,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,- Are you sure? - I'm sure.
747,00:31:32.63,00:31:32.63,- Made me uniquely prepared to live in Los Angeles.
748,00:31:35.33,00:31:35.33,(cars honking)
749,00:31:37.77,00:31:37.77,- My days usually begin with a workout.
750,00:31:39.67,00:31:39.67,"Okay, guys, what do all good Californians do?"
751,00:31:43.23,00:31:43.23,Go to the gym!
752,00:31:44.60,00:31:44.60,"- Three, two, one, all right."
753,00:31:47.90,00:31:47.90,- All right.
754,00:31:50.30,00:31:50.30,"By day, I edit."
755,00:31:52.80,00:31:52.80,I'm a behavioral research analyst.
756,00:31:54.50,00:31:54.50,"What I do is very, very detail-oriented."
757,00:31:57.30,00:31:57.30,I edit books.
758,00:31:58.57,00:31:58.57,"I mean, it's interesting to me, I love academics."
759,00:32:00.63,00:32:00.63,I love research.
760,00:32:03.57,00:32:03.57,Was cute.
761,00:32:04.83,00:32:04.83,But part of me is a big homebody-- crocheting.
762,00:32:07.07,00:32:07.07,It's... it's my weird introverted habit.
763,00:32:10.57,00:32:10.57,"I made this myself, and it's big."
764,00:32:13.73,00:32:13.73,"It's really, actually, if you look at it,"
765,00:32:14.80,00:32:14.80,it's not straight.
766,00:32:15.83,00:32:15.83,But don't tell anybody.
767,00:32:17.27,00:32:17.27,I usually actually make pillows.
768,00:32:19.27,00:32:19.27,"Oh, I have one of those, too."
769,00:32:20.33,00:32:20.33,Pillows are my favorite.
770,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,"Well, I can't reach it because it's on the top shelf,"
771,00:32:23.50,00:32:23.50,but trust me that I have a pillow.
772,00:32:24.93,00:32:24.93,I really... I can't sit still.
773,00:32:27.30,00:32:27.30,But then there's this other side of me.
774,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,"I hop in my car, drive way too fast."
775,00:32:32.80,00:32:32.80,I love to cut loose.
776,00:32:34.07,00:32:34.07,"I love to, you know, be wild."
777,00:32:35.60,00:32:35.60,"And then, you know, I come back, I love to crochet."
778,00:32:38.50,00:32:38.50,Are you calling me schizophrenic?
779,00:32:40.07,00:32:40.07,I love baking cookies.
780,00:32:41.43,00:32:41.43,The secret is that I'm just a big dork at heart.
781,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,It's just who I am.
782,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,"But, yeah, that's me."
783,00:32:51.50,00:32:51.50,"- Before I left for Survivor,  I was working a lot."
784,00:32:56.00,00:32:56.00,"My mom, who's my best friend and, you know, she was even"
785,00:33:01.03,00:33:01.03,"saying, ""Teresa, I'm telling you, you're..."
786,00:33:03.03,00:33:03.03,"""You're not spending enough time with your children."
787,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,"You're working too much."""
788,00:33:06.77,00:33:06.77,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
789,00:33:09.53,00:33:09.53,- Teresa doesn't want to be a real estate agent.
790,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,"She wants to be the best real estate agent,"
791,00:33:14.13,00:33:14.13,because that's just the way she is.
792,00:33:15.30,00:33:15.30,She's basically a corporation.
793,00:33:20.30,00:33:20.30,"She was gone a long time, 48 days, with no communication."
794,00:33:24.33,00:33:24.33,It was a long time.
795,00:33:26.13,00:33:26.13,"I obviously missed her, and the kids missed her."
796,00:33:28.87,00:33:28.87,- I told my husband Brian when I left
797,00:33:32.53,00:33:32.53,"and the way I looked at it was,"
798,00:33:34.57,00:33:34.57,"""I'm not going on a summer vacation to Africa."
799,00:33:36.63,00:33:36.63,"""I'm not going on a safari."
800,00:33:37.73,00:33:37.73,"I'm going on a business trip."""
801,00:33:41.53,00:33:41.53,The objective of the business trip was to go out there
802,00:33:44.63,00:33:44.63,and be the last one standing of 16 people.
803,00:33:51.37,00:33:51.37,It's just mind over matter.
804,00:33:52.90,00:33:52.90,"It's just a matter of saying, ""I'm going to stand up here,"
805,00:33:55.27,00:33:55.27,"and I'm going to be the last one, no matter what."""
806,00:33:58.83,00:33:58.83,- I get really scared every night
807,00:34:00.93,00:34:00.93,because I'm afraid my mom could get voted off that night
808,00:34:05.13,00:34:05.13,"and, like, she could lose a challenge."
809,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,(cheering)
810,00:34:11.33,00:34:11.33,"- Six hours, 20 seconds."
811,00:34:13.97,00:34:13.97,"You, my dear, get this."
812,00:34:15.70,00:34:15.70,- Thank you. - Congratulations.
813,00:34:17.63,00:34:17.63,- I kept thinking about my children.
814,00:34:19.13,00:34:19.13,I kept thinking about Tyler and Elly.
815,00:34:22.10,00:34:22.10,And I kept thinking about watching the show with them
816,00:34:25.80,00:34:25.80,"and them seeing their mom, one of the oldest ones,"
817,00:34:29.13,00:34:29.13,and just thinking how proud they would be.
818,00:34:35.87,00:34:35.87,"When I was out in Africa,"
819,00:34:37.80,00:34:37.80,I had so much time to think about family
820,00:34:40.87,00:34:40.87,"and what's really, really important."
821,00:34:43.47,00:34:43.47,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
822,00:34:47.53,00:34:47.53,I started making a mental list in my mind of things
823,00:34:50.70,00:34:50.70,I wanted to change when I got back home.
824,00:34:54.13,00:34:54.13,"Reading to the kids more,"
825,00:34:57.83,00:34:57.83,saying their prayers with them at night.
826,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,Saying the blessing at the dinner table every night.
827,00:35:03.70,00:35:03.70,Giving Brian more back rubs.
828,00:35:06.27,00:35:06.27,I might regret saying that.
829,00:35:09.60,00:35:09.60,"- When I was watching her plane to come in,"
830,00:35:11.77,00:35:11.77,"she was the one of the last ones to get off,"
831,00:35:13.93,00:35:13.93,"and then when she got off,"
832,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,I was the first one to run up there and hug her.
833,00:35:17.20,00:35:17.20,It felt great.
834,00:35:19.20,00:35:19.20,(laughing)
835,00:35:21.17,00:35:21.17,- As opposed to me just being...
836,00:35:22.57,00:35:22.57,"being a mom and a good friend,"
837,00:35:24.73,00:35:24.73,"hopefully they'll see me as a role model, and say,"
838,00:35:28.17,00:35:28.17,"""Hey, Mom, that's pretty cool."""
839,00:35:32.30,00:35:32.30,- I'm a city kid.
840,00:35:33.37,00:35:33.37,I've grown up in the city.
841,00:35:34.63,00:35:34.63,The city is where I'm from.
842,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,"Before Survivor,  I was a financial consultant."
843,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,"- Clarence was my stockbroker. - How you doing, Mr. Green?"
844,00:35:41.47,00:35:41.47,"- So we made some investments,"
845,00:35:43.10,00:35:43.10,that we was able to turn a profit and open a business...
846,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57,"- I was, I guess, in that rat race,"
847,00:35:49.73,00:35:49.73,just like everybody else: 9:00 to 5:00 job.
848,00:35:52.03,00:35:52.03,It just wasn't for me.
849,00:35:54.50,00:35:54.50,"In my first trip out of the country,"
850,00:35:56.30,00:35:56.30,I'm seeing animals and I'm seeing a way of life
851,00:35:58.80,00:35:58.80,that I... that I can't even conceive of.
852,00:36:00.70,00:36:00.70,"I could still see him, too, I don't want to move."
853,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73,"It was just an awesome experience,"
854,00:36:04.40,00:36:04.40,"and the food was good, too."
855,00:36:06.00,00:36:06.00,"When I see a gazelle now, I think, like,"
856,00:36:08.00,00:36:08.00,"""Man, you're a good piece of meat."""
857,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,(laughter)
858,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,- Notice how everything eventually came back to food.
859,00:36:13.77,00:36:13.77,"When they said, ""I think Clarence took two cherries,"""
860,00:36:16.53,00:36:16.53,"the first thought was, ""Yeah, Clarence took two cherries."""
861,00:36:20.57,00:36:20.57,- I want to be a food critic.
862,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,I'm going to be called the man's man's food critic.
863,00:36:23.97,00:36:23.97,"All right, we got ourselves some barbecue, all up in here."
864,00:36:28.07,00:36:28.07,My man doing it up.
865,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"We got some mac and cheese, Greens."
866,00:36:32.03,00:36:32.03,"That's a delicacy there, baby."
867,00:36:33.63,00:36:33.63,If there's one thing being on Survivor's taught me is--
868,00:36:36.47,00:36:36.47,be yourself.
869,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,"I came back feeling like, ""Wow, man."
870,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,"I've got to come up with some new goals."""
871,00:36:43.37,00:36:43.37,It made me want to go see more of these exotic places
872,00:36:46.40,00:36:46.40,that are out there and not just be a city dweller.
873,00:36:52.10,00:36:52.10,(alarm clock beeping)
874,00:36:54.77,00:36:54.77,"- My life as a single mom, it's not a chore,"
875,00:36:57.87,00:36:57.87,it's not a duty.
876,00:36:58.93,00:36:58.93,It's a way of life for me.
877,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,I get ready for work.
878,00:37:03.20,00:37:03.20,I always wear makeup.
879,00:37:04.80,00:37:04.80,It makes me feel like I'm ready for the day.
880,00:37:06.87,00:37:06.87,That's it!
881,00:37:08.13,00:37:08.13,Just enjoying a little bit of downtime before
882,00:37:10.40,00:37:10.40,going off to the post office and another hectic day.
883,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,Good morning.
884,00:37:15.60,00:37:15.60,Then I wake my son up.
885,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,Got a kiss?
886,00:37:18.80,00:37:18.80,"The whole time we were over in Africa,"
887,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,we couldn't make any contact with our family.
888,00:37:23.10,00:37:23.10,- En guard!
889,00:37:24.13,00:37:24.13,"- I wanted to just say, ""I'm okay, Alex."
890,00:37:26.20,00:37:26.20,"I didn't get eaten up by a lion."""
891,00:37:27.87,00:37:27.87,My safe return!
892,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,My home's great.
893,00:37:30.63,00:37:30.63,I love my home.
894,00:37:31.73,00:37:31.73,"It's bright, it's fun, it's happy."
895,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,"I'm bright and fun and happy, so..."
896,00:37:36.47,00:37:36.47,- You feel like you're inside a box of colors.
897,00:37:39.20,00:37:39.20,"And when you go into another house,"
898,00:37:40.70,00:37:40.70,you just feel like you're in
899,00:37:41.80,00:37:41.80,a regular box of brown or white.
900,00:37:47.27,00:37:47.27,- I'm real good at my job.
901,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,I am real good at carrying mail.
902,00:37:51.00,00:37:51.00,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
903,00:37:52.87,00:37:52.87,"The audience, they didn't get to know me."
904,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,- I did not open the can for me.
905,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,I opened the can for her.
906,00:37:58.63,00:37:58.63,- The bean incident.
907,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,"- That's a lie! - Clarence, that is not."
908,00:38:01.87,00:38:01.87,- Diane! - He lied.
909,00:38:03.63,00:38:03.63,He knows he lied.
910,00:38:04.93,00:38:04.93,I think I'm a little more sensitive
911,00:38:07.13,00:38:07.13,than I was before I left.
912,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,I don't take anything for granted anymore.
913,00:38:13.50,00:38:13.50,"Love you, baby."
914,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,"- Good night, Mom, I love you."
915,00:38:18.07,00:38:18.07,(Probst) - Ahead on Survivor:  Back from Africa...
916,00:38:21.60,00:38:21.60,"- You don't have to be an evil, back-stabbing person"
917,00:38:24.03,00:38:24.03,to do well in this game.
918,00:38:26.30,00:38:26.30,- What it took to win.
919,00:38:31.70,00:38:31.70,"- In the end, it was the professional soccer player"
920,00:38:34.77,00:38:34.77,"and coach from Lexington, Massachusetts,"
921,00:38:37.37,00:38:37.37,who was the sole Survivor.
922,00:38:39.27,00:38:39.27,"He won it with his strength, his smarts,"
923,00:38:42.30,00:38:42.30,but mostly by sticking to his principles.
924,00:38:45.30,00:38:45.30,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
925,00:38:47.23,00:38:47.23,"- Before he left for Africa,"
926,00:38:49.97,00:38:49.97,"I said to him, ""Ethan, it's not that important that"
927,00:38:55.23,00:38:55.23,"""you come home with a million dollars,"
928,00:38:57.37,00:38:57.37,"""but you know what you have to come home with."
929,00:38:59.33,00:38:59.33,"You have to come home with your integrity."""
930,00:39:01.60,00:39:01.60,"- I said to myself, like, ""Listen, I'm not going to change"
931,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,"""who I am as a person to be on the show."
932,00:39:06.43,00:39:06.43,"I want to come back with my dignity and self-respect."""
933,00:39:08.93,00:39:08.93,"When I come home to Lexington, that's where I grew up,"
934,00:39:11.50,00:39:11.50,then I usually make a grand entrance.
935,00:39:12.87,00:39:12.87,(cheers)
936,00:39:14.03,00:39:14.03,"That kid's got, you got my hair back there."
937,00:39:17.07,00:39:17.07,I like that.
938,00:39:18.27,00:39:18.27,"Usually I go on and, you know, see my brother."
939,00:39:20.80,00:39:20.80,He's a chiropractor.
940,00:39:21.97,00:39:21.97,Hi.
941,00:39:23.00,00:39:23.00,- Doing okay?
942,00:39:24.03,00:39:24.03,- So he gives me a little adjustment
943,00:39:25.07,00:39:25.07,to straighten me out a bit.
944,00:39:26.37,00:39:26.37,"I stop, I see my mom in her little knitting store."
945,00:39:29.60,00:39:29.60,"Hi, Mommy."
946,00:39:31.10,00:39:31.10,- Ethan!
947,00:39:32.13,00:39:32.13,I think he's appealing to women.
948,00:39:33.50,00:39:33.50,"I mean, I cringe a little when one of my friends say,"
949,00:39:36.47,00:39:36.47,"""Oh, your son's really hot!"""
950,00:39:38.63,00:39:38.63,- I've always liked women.
951,00:39:40.90,00:39:40.90,"Maybe because I was brought up by my mom, I didn't have..."
952,00:39:42.70,00:39:42.70,"I was sensitive, you know, the whole sensitive guy thing."
953,00:39:45.77,00:39:45.77,I'm in touch with my feminine side.
954,00:39:47.63,00:39:47.63,- Maybe it's because I doted on him so much
955,00:39:49.70,00:39:49.70,after his father died.
956,00:39:51.40,00:39:51.40,"The biggest tragedy in his life was when his father died,"
957,00:39:56.70,00:39:56.70,and he was just 14 years old.
958,00:39:59.80,00:39:59.80,"- He got diagnosed with colon cancer,"
959,00:40:02.87,00:40:02.87,and I think from the time he was diagnosed
960,00:40:05.67,00:40:05.67,"to when he passed away, it was maybe a year."
961,00:40:09.20,00:40:09.20,"- No matter where Ethan went in the evening, you know,"
962,00:40:12.33,00:40:12.33,"he knew he had to be home about 10:30,"
963,00:40:15.03,00:40:15.03,11:00 to help get his father up the stairs.
964,00:40:19.33,00:40:19.33,"He could be, you know, having the best time of his life,"
965,00:40:22.90,00:40:22.90,"but he was home, come 10:30, 11:00."
966,00:40:26.43,00:40:26.43,"If my husband woke up in the middle of the night,"
967,00:40:28.63,00:40:28.63,"I couldn't lift him or take him where he needed to go,"
968,00:40:32.00,00:40:32.00,"he'd say, ""Okay, Dad, I'm going to count to three."
969,00:40:35.90,00:40:35.90,"Put your arms around my neck, and I'll lift you."""
970,00:40:40.07,00:40:40.07,And that's what would happen time and time again.
971,00:40:43.77,00:40:43.77,- Having my father pass away
972,00:40:45.87,00:40:45.87,"and, kind of, me overcoming that, you know, I could have..."
973,00:40:48.57,00:40:48.57,"is definitely, you know, my first lesson in survival,"
974,00:40:52.30,00:40:52.30,"I guess, in being a survivor,"
975,00:40:54.43,00:40:54.43,"because I could have easily, you know,"
976,00:40:57.73,00:40:57.73,"gone the whole drug route, drop out of school, you know,"
977,00:41:01.37,00:41:01.37,be depressed my whole life.
978,00:41:03.27,00:41:03.27,"- I feel there was a change in him after that,"
979,00:41:05.97,00:41:05.97,a sense of intensity that I didn't see before.
980,00:41:10.97,00:41:10.97,- I wanted to push forward and try to succeed
981,00:41:13.13,00:41:13.13,and be the best I could possibly be at everything
982,00:41:15.17,00:41:15.17,that I've done.
983,00:41:16.70,00:41:16.70,"Let's go, blue!"
984,00:41:20.37,00:41:20.37,Yeah!
985,00:41:22.40,00:41:22.40,"You know, I never thought in a million years"
986,00:41:24.70,00:41:24.70,that I'd be playing professional soccer.
987,00:41:25.70,00:41:25.70,It was always a dream of mine.
988,00:41:27.10,00:41:27.10,Easy! Easy!
989,00:41:28.77,00:41:28.77,"I played for the United States Maccabee team,"
990,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,and I went to Africa.
991,00:41:35.27,00:41:35.27,"I went to Zimbabwe,"
992,00:41:37.07,00:41:37.07,and I was one of two white people in the entire league.
993,00:41:41.77,00:41:41.77,Walking into a stadium...
994,00:41:43.80,00:41:43.80,(crowd cheering)
995,00:41:45.47,00:41:45.47,"...with 50,000 people is just uplifting."
996,00:41:49.50,00:41:49.50,"Every time I step on the field, every time I put my cleats on,"
997,00:41:52.27,00:41:52.27,"I just, you know, get that energy,"
998,00:41:53.83,00:41:53.83,"that buzz that you get when,"
999,00:41:55.53,00:41:55.53,"you know, it's... you're doing something you love."
1000,00:41:57.80,00:41:57.80,"- You got it baby, you got it!"
1001,00:42:00.23,00:42:00.23,(cheering)
1002,00:42:02.50,00:42:02.50,- There it is!
1003,00:42:04.23,00:42:04.23,- Survivor is a brilliant game.
1004,00:42:06.33,00:42:06.33,You're hungry all the time.
1005,00:42:07.40,00:42:07.40,You're tired all the time.
1006,00:42:08.47,00:42:08.47,You're dirty all the time.
1007,00:42:09.83,00:42:09.83,You're thirsty all the time.
1008,00:42:11.37,00:42:11.37,And then you have to make friends with people.
