1,00:00:15.50,00:00:18.40,"JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 16 Americans began"
2,00:00:18.40,00:00:23.13, the adventure of a lifetime in exotic Thailand.
3,00:00:23.13,00:00:25.50," They journeyed to Tarutao Island,"
4,00:00:25.50,00:00:28.97, a former prison campand one-time haven for pirates.
5,00:00:28.97,00:00:30.70,"You're going to chooseyour own tribes, right now."
6,00:00:30.70,00:00:33.17, In keeping with the Thai tradition of honoring
7,00:00:33.17,00:00:36.77," the elders, the two oldest castaways, Jake and Jan,"
8,00:00:36.77,00:00:39.27, were allowed to pick their own tribes.
9,00:00:39.27,00:00:41.67,TED:I was surprised by Jan's picks.
10,00:00:41.67,00:00:43.00, It seems like
11,00:00:43.00,00:00:44.90,most of the tribe members
12,00:00:44.90,00:00:46.93," were older members, if you will."
13,00:00:46.93,00:00:48.93,Survivors ready? Go!
14,00:00:48.93,00:00:50.27,"PROBST: From the beginning, it looked as if"
15,00:00:50.27,00:00:53.37, the older Chuay Gahn tribe would be the underdog.
16,00:00:53.37,00:00:55.77,Sook Jai wins immunity!
17,00:00:55.77,00:00:57.53,-I'm so sorry.-Don't worry about it. -No.
18,00:00:57.53,00:00:59.63, But Sook Jai had trouble bonding.
19,00:00:59.63,00:01:00.90,"I'm not here to beyelled at by you, dude."
20,00:01:00.90,00:01:02.07,"I'm not yelling at you, sweetie."
21,00:01:02.07,00:01:03.37,"I'm saying I wantto sleep tonight, okay?"
22,00:01:03.37,00:01:05.10,"How'd you sleep last night?Pretty good, huh?"
23,00:01:05.10,00:01:06.93,My point exactly. Walk away.
24,00:01:06.93,00:01:09.00,PROBST: And they let their youthful enthusiasm
25,00:01:09.00,00:01:10.87, get the better of them.
26,00:01:10.87,00:01:12.40,"No, no, no!"
27,00:01:12.40,00:01:15.47,Chuay Gahn proved they could be strong competitors.
28,00:01:15.47,00:01:17.30,Chuay Gahn wins reward!
29,00:01:17.30,00:01:19.97, But they also had their own bumps in the road.
30,00:01:19.97,00:01:22.20,"For some crazy reason,"
31,00:01:22.20,00:01:26.90,"you know, in that position,I started grinding on Ghandia."
32,00:01:26.90,00:01:28.90,"To me, I got the feeling thatyou was trying to get with me."
33,00:01:28.90,00:01:30.30,No. No. No.
34,00:01:30.30,00:01:31.77,I'm not even attracted to you!
35,00:01:33.33,00:01:35.27,PROBST: The castaways have experienced
36,00:01:35.27,00:01:37.20, the hardships of island life.
37,00:01:37.20,00:01:38.93,(screaming)
38,00:01:38.93,00:01:40.73,He probably pushed offon a stingray
39,00:01:40.73,00:01:42.83, and got a stinger in his foot.
40,00:01:42.83,00:01:44.67,"Damn, it ... hurts!"
41,00:01:44.67,00:01:46.43,HELEN: It was a nightmare. At one point I was about ready--
42,00:01:46.43,00:01:48.40,"if I had a pistol in my pocket, I would've pulled it out,"
43,00:01:48.40,00:01:50.40,"shot her first, shot me second."
44,00:01:50.40,00:01:52.50,PROBST: And they have experienced the joys
45,00:01:52.50,00:01:53.90, of an exotic land.
46,00:01:53.90,00:01:56.53,SHII ANN: It was just wonderful to be able to see
47,00:01:56.53,00:01:57.70, some of Thai culture.
48,00:01:59.93,00:02:02.13,CLAY: It is absolutely gorgeous.
49,00:02:02.13,00:02:04.10, You got these limestone cliffs
50,00:02:04.10,00:02:06.07, and mountains and hills and caves.
51,00:02:06.07,00:02:07.87, There's no way to describe
52,00:02:07.87,00:02:09.53,the beauty th-that's here.
53,00:02:10.83,00:02:11.83,PROBST: They have clashed...
54,00:02:11.83,00:02:13.47,I'm not ... stupid.
55,00:02:13.47,00:02:15.33, ...and they have overcome their differences.
56,00:02:15.33,00:02:16.57,"I'll tell you what,you're a good man."
57,00:02:16.57,00:02:17.57,I like you.
58,00:02:17.57,00:02:19.17,"ROBB:Amen, bro."
59,00:02:19.17,00:02:21.23," But no matter how strong their bond,"
60,00:02:21.23,00:02:23.87, Tribal Council always loomed.
61,00:02:23.87,00:02:27.27," In the first 18 days, three members from Sook Jai"
62,00:02:27.27,00:02:30.87, and three members from ChuayGahn were voted off the island.
63,00:02:30.87,00:02:34.57," On day 19, the two tribes moved onto one beach,"
64,00:02:34.57,00:02:37.17, and the castaways believed they had merged.
65,00:02:37.17,00:02:38.70,"One, two, three."
66,00:02:38.70,00:02:39.70,Family!
67,00:02:39.70,00:02:41.03,(cheering)
68,00:02:41.03,00:02:42.37, But that wasn't the case.
69,00:02:42.37,00:02:43.83,"-You said, ""merge.""-Yes."
70,00:02:43.83,00:02:44.87,I certainly didn't say anything
71,00:02:44.87,00:02:46.10,"to give you that impression,did I?"
72,00:02:47.20,00:02:49.90,The two tribes never merged.
73,00:02:49.90,00:02:52.70, The false merge sent strategies reeling
74,00:02:52.70,00:02:55.90, and put desperation right out in the open.
75,00:02:55.90,00:02:57.67,This is not a tribe unified.
76,00:02:57.67,00:03:01.17,"Penny, you're manipulative."
77,00:03:01.17,00:03:02.63,I've had plenty of opportunity
78,00:03:02.63,00:03:05.87,to vote Shii Ann outif I wanted to.
79,00:03:05.87,00:03:08.73,"PROBST: Sook Jai lost another member, and the tribe"
80,00:03:08.73,00:03:10.73, was at a numbers disadvantage.
81,00:03:10.73,00:03:13.63, Living on the same beach as two separate tribes
82,00:03:13.63,00:03:16.30, was a trying experience for everyone.
83,00:03:16.30,00:03:18.87,KEN: The cave smells of urine.
84,00:03:18.87,00:03:20.67,Chuay Gahn has been pissingin the front of the cave.
85,00:03:20.67,00:03:22.33,Cashew butterscotch squares.
86,00:03:22.33,00:03:24.60,"-Ooh, that sounds good.-Ooh, one of those."
87,00:03:24.60,00:03:26.87,"JAKE: My God. You know, I need to go somewhere else"
88,00:03:26.87,00:03:27.90," when she starts that recipe stuff,"
89,00:03:27.90,00:03:30.57,"which is nonstop, 24/7."
90,00:03:30.57,00:03:31.87,PROBST: Even the monkeys were
91,00:03:31.87,00:03:34.07, testing the castaways' patience.
92,00:03:34.07,00:03:36.23,All the bananas that were savedfor tonight are gone.
93,00:03:36.23,00:03:37.63,"Oh, no."
94,00:03:39.90,00:03:42.73, Sook Jai continued their downward spiral...
95,00:03:42.73,00:03:44.63,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
96,00:03:44.63,00:03:47.17, ...and lost another member.
97,00:03:47.17,00:03:51.00," When the merge finally materialized on day 26,"
98,00:03:51.00,00:03:55.93,"the remaining Sook Jais, one byone, had their torches snuffed."
99,00:03:55.93,00:03:58.80," Last week, the time came for the former"
100,00:03:58.80,00:04:01.67, Chuay Gahn tribe to turn on each other.
101,00:04:01.67,00:04:05.17,Ted and Helen questioned Clay's contributions to camp life.
102,00:04:05.17,00:04:06.50,TED: I think the reason why
103,00:04:06.50,00:04:08.03,he's been aroundthis long is because
104,00:04:08.03,00:04:10.87," he's a comical character, he keeps us laughing."
105,00:04:10.87,00:04:13.03, But it's just time for him to be voted off.
106,00:04:13.03,00:04:16.23,"PROBST: At the reward challenge, Ted won a new car..."
107,00:04:16.23,00:04:17.23,-Ted wins reward!-Yeah!
108,00:04:17.23,00:04:18.70,"Yeah, baby!"
109,00:04:18.70,00:04:20.17, ...and chose to take Helen with him
110,00:04:20.17,00:04:22.03, for a Thai dinner and massage.
111,00:04:22.03,00:04:24.17,Welcome.  Sawat-dee kha!
112,00:04:24.17,00:04:25.83, Sawat-dee kha!
113,00:04:25.83,00:04:27.87,PROBST: Ted downed the wine...
114,00:04:27.87,00:04:29.70,Ah!
115,00:04:29.70,00:04:32.53, ...and tried to solidify the plan to vote Clay out.
116,00:04:32.53,00:04:33.90,Clay.
117,00:04:33.90,00:04:35.10,-Yeah.-Out of here.
118,00:04:35.10,00:04:36.97,"You got to be quiet about that,"
119,00:04:36.97,00:04:39.03,"-you know what I'm saying?-Oh, yeah."
120,00:04:39.03,00:04:41.67,I forgot where I was.
121,00:04:41.67,00:04:44.17," PROBST: Back at camp, the rest of the tribe"
122,00:04:44.17,00:04:47.13, was growing nervous about Ted and Helen's friendship.
123,00:04:47.13,00:04:49.17,What were you saying earlierabout all the whispering?
124,00:04:49.17,00:04:50.27,Who was doing the whispering?
125,00:04:50.27,00:04:52.97,"Teddy and, um, Helen."
126,00:04:52.97,00:04:54.30,And writing in the dirt.
127,00:04:54.30,00:04:55.40,Hmm.
128,00:04:55.40,00:04:57.23,"PROBST: But when Helen returned,"
129,00:04:57.23,00:04:59.60, she shared Ted's plan with Brian.
130,00:04:59.60,00:05:01.20,"You know, I sat and listenedto everything he said,"
131,00:05:01.20,00:05:02.77,"and I ""yeah, yeah, yeahed"" himto death."
132,00:05:02.77,00:05:04.77,"-Yeah, I know, I know.-Agreed, agreed, agreed."
133,00:05:04.77,00:05:06.30,Let Ted believewhat he thinks he believes.
134,00:05:06.30,00:05:08.00,HELEN: I'm definitely playing two sides of the fence.
135,00:05:08.00,00:05:10.27, Everybody out here is playing both sides of the fence.
136,00:05:10.27,00:05:11.73,Just hope you don't get caught.
137,00:05:11.73,00:05:14.67,PROBST: Strategies and alliances were in question
138,00:05:14.67,00:05:16.03, when Brian won the immunity challenge.
139,00:05:16.03,00:05:17.73,Brian wins immunity!
140,00:05:17.73,00:05:19.13,"Good job, Brian."
141,00:05:19.13,00:05:22.83, So Ted asked Brian straight up if he was the next to go.
142,00:05:22.83,00:05:24.23,"I'm asking you,brother to brother."
143,00:05:24.23,00:05:25.50,Okay.
144,00:05:25.50,00:05:26.90,Am I the next to go?
145,00:05:26.90,00:05:28.23,No. Uh-uh.
146,00:05:28.23,00:05:30.90," At Tribal Council, Ted felt the sting of betrayal"
147,00:05:30.90,00:05:33.30, when he was unanimously voted out
148,00:05:33.30,00:05:34.90, and sent off to join the jury.
149,00:05:36.27,00:05:38.03,"Ted, the tribe has spoken."
150,00:05:39.80,00:05:42.17," Now, only four remain."
151,00:05:42.17,00:05:43.60," Tonight, they will compete in"
152,00:05:43.60,00:05:45.63, their final immunity challenges.
153,00:05:45.63,00:05:49.07," Two will move on to face the jury, one will outlast"
154,00:05:49.07,00:05:52.00, all the rest and become the sole Survivor.
155,00:07:06.57,00:07:09.03,"He didn't have too much to sayon the way out, did he?"
156,00:07:09.03,00:07:13.50,He wouldn't even turn around andlook at us when he was leaving.
157,00:07:13.50,00:07:15.63,(bats squeaking)
158,00:07:17.10,00:07:19.13,"Y'all, there's onlyfour torches."
159,00:07:19.13,00:07:20.53,JAN:Yeah.
160,00:07:20.53,00:07:22.07,JAN: Last Tribal Council was
161,00:07:22.07,00:07:24.10, a little bit harder because Ted was
162,00:07:24.10,00:07:27.23,"the first of the, of the lastChuay Gahn five."
163,00:07:27.23,00:07:31.33,"Uh, it was the beginningof the realization"
164,00:07:31.33,00:07:33.87,"that each one of us have to go, except for one."
165,00:07:34.93,00:07:37.37,HELEN:Ooh.
166,00:07:37.37,00:07:39.07,BRIAN:Nice.
167,00:07:39.07,00:07:41.90,Let there be light.
168,00:07:41.90,00:07:44.53,"CLAY: We knew that when we got to this point,"
169,00:07:44.53,00:07:45.97, we was getting rid of Ted.
170,00:07:45.97,00:07:47.63, It was a total shock to Ted.
171,00:07:47.63,00:07:49.83,"The whole time we'd been tellinghim, ""We're kicking Jan off,"
172,00:07:49.83,00:07:51.63,"we're kicking Jan off."""
173,00:07:51.63,00:07:53.63,There ain't no tellingwhat went through his mind
174,00:07:53.63,00:07:56.03,when he saw his namepop up three times.
175,00:07:56.03,00:07:59.20,I'm sure he was furious.
176,00:07:59.20,00:08:01.20,Mm-hmm. No hard feelings;we got to do what we got to do.
177,00:08:01.20,00:08:02.80,BRIAN:That's part of the game.
178,00:08:02.80,00:08:04.33,(yawns)
179,00:08:04.33,00:08:05.77,"HELEN: At this level in the game,"
180,00:08:05.77,00:08:07.37, it becomes cutthroat.
181,00:08:07.37,00:08:10.00, It becomes every man for himself.
182,00:08:10.00,00:08:12.20,So the next couple days I expectto be extremely stressful.
183,00:08:12.20,00:08:14.73,Final four-- sounds likea basketball tournament.
184,00:08:14.73,00:08:16.23,JAN: I know it.That's all I can think about.
185,00:08:16.23,00:08:17.60,You know.
186,00:08:17.60,00:08:19.87,JAN:Isn't that funny?
187,00:08:40.60,00:08:42.07,"HELEN:Oh, my gosh!"
188,00:08:42.07,00:08:43.50,"Santa Claus came, Clay."
189,00:08:43.50,00:08:45.13,CLAY:Good Lord.
190,00:08:45.13,00:08:46.80,"HELEN:Oh, look, it's everybody's name."
191,00:08:46.80,00:08:47.87,"-BRIAN: Oh.-CLAY: Oh, neat."
192,00:08:47.87,00:08:49.30,JAN:Oh!
193,00:08:49.30,00:08:50.90,HELEN:Here we go.
194,00:08:50.90,00:08:55.00,"""Lotus-shaped boat used indifferent Thai celebrations"

204,00:09:18.37,00:09:21.07,"CLAY: This morning, we got an early treemail; it was a bunch"
205,00:09:21.07,00:09:22.87," of flowers, and we're supposed to fix up"
206,00:09:22.87,00:09:24.87, a float for each tribe member
207,00:09:24.87,00:09:27.00," that's been kicked off the island, and, uh,"
208,00:09:27.00,00:09:28.80,there's some kind of traditionin Thailand
209,00:09:28.80,00:09:31.67,about sending somethingout to-to sea.
210,00:09:31.67,00:09:33.77," You know, a message out of love and hope"
211,00:09:33.77,00:09:35.10,and good luck in-in the future.
212,00:09:35.10,00:09:37.77, I think that's... it's-it's what it's all about.
213,00:09:37.77,00:09:39.43,"We got a job to do, people."
214,00:09:41.87,00:09:43.83,-This is an example?-JAN: Right.
215,00:09:43.83,00:09:46.07,"Well, wait a minute, I got sometweezers or something in here."
216,00:09:46.07,00:09:48.03,I need toenail clippers bad.
217,00:09:49.63,00:09:51.00,Toothpicks.
218,00:09:51.00,00:09:53.23,Oh.
219,00:09:53.23,00:09:55.93,"HELEN: Oh, man,I've been dying for that."
220,00:09:55.93,00:09:58.03,We'll do them in order.
221,00:09:58.03,00:09:59.70,BRIAN: We're gonna go downthe assembly line.
222,00:09:59.70,00:10:01.13,"JAN:Oh, that looks real good."
223,00:10:01.13,00:10:02.53,"HELEN:That looks really nice, Clay."
224,00:10:02.53,00:10:04.33,"CLAY: I looked at each individual,"
225,00:10:04.33,00:10:06.50, and tried to put them
226,00:10:06.50,00:10:08.53, as I saw them.  We just tried to
227,00:10:08.53,00:10:10.70, fit the personalities into each little float
228,00:10:10.70,00:10:12.50,that we're going to send outto sea later on.
229,00:10:12.50,00:10:15.50,Erin was going to geta lotus tattooed
230,00:10:15.50,00:10:18.47,on her foot. Why don't wegive her this lotus?
231,00:10:18.47,00:10:19.97,CLAY:Okay.
232,00:10:19.97,00:10:22.50,"JAN: With 16 different personalities, you're going to"
233,00:10:22.50,00:10:25.20," have people that generally don't really like each other,"
234,00:10:25.20,00:10:27.13, but you learn to get along.
235,00:10:27.13,00:10:29.33, So even if you had someone's wreath
236,00:10:29.33,00:10:31.80,"that you weren'tparticularly crazy about,"
237,00:10:31.80,00:10:33.20,you still made it good.
238,00:10:33.20,00:10:35.30,"BRIAN: Why you spending so muchtime on Ghandia's, huh, Clay?"
239,00:10:35.30,00:10:37.30,I'm fittin' to stickyour ass with a pin.
240,00:10:37.30,00:10:38.67,(chuckles)
241,00:10:38.67,00:10:40.37,"I'm being nice,'cause nobody else will do it."
242,00:10:45.80,00:10:47.70,"BRIAN: When I was making those wreaths,"
243,00:10:47.70,00:10:48.77," all's I thought about was, uh,"
244,00:10:48.77,00:10:50.70,"""You've come a long way, baby."""
245,00:10:53.67,00:10:55.43," You've had to make some tough decisions,"
246,00:10:55.43,00:10:58.47, but I would so much rather be in my position than looking at
247,00:10:58.47,00:11:00.77," one of those wreaths, seeing my name on there."
248,00:11:00.77,00:11:02.63," This is a business trip, strictly."
249,00:11:02.63,00:11:04.20, My attire is just
250,00:11:04.20,00:11:08.33,"beard and, uh, uh, bathing suitsout here."
251,00:11:08.33,00:11:09.80,But I'm still in business mode.
252,00:11:19.80,00:11:21.47, CLAY: We got to get the immunity today.
253,00:11:21.47,00:11:23.90,Okay. Either-- and then we'llwor... worry about tomorrow.
254,00:11:23.90,00:11:25.67,But the best thingis not to talk about it.
255,00:11:25.67,00:11:27.20,"-Oh, okay. -So they don't,you know-- Okay, good."
256,00:11:29.90,00:11:32.40,Oh!
257,00:11:32.40,00:11:34.17,Check the inside.
258,00:11:34.17,00:11:35.37,No. Okay.
259,00:11:35.37,00:11:36.87,On top.
260,00:11:36.87,00:11:38.00,That's cool.
261,00:11:38.00,00:11:39.80,"There's no ifs, andsor buts, Clay."
262,00:11:39.80,00:11:40.90,"No ifs, ands or buts."
263,00:11:40.90,00:11:42.23,-No. Won't happen with me.-Okay.
264,00:11:42.23,00:11:43.37,"I mean, this isoutside the game."
265,00:11:43.37,00:11:44.60,Fine. That's right.
266,00:11:44.60,00:11:47.33,"We got treemail, guys!"
267,00:11:47.33,00:11:48.93,"Oh, great!"
268,00:11:48.93,00:11:50.90,Dust off your sail.
269,00:11:50.90,00:11:52.80,The one brain sailyou have left.
270,00:11:52.80,00:11:53.83,"Oh, no."
271,00:11:53.83,00:11:55.10,"""Cell,"" not ""sail."""
272,00:11:55.10,00:11:56.83,Oh.(chuckles)
273,00:11:56.83,00:12:00.97,"""Only fools repeat mistakes,and hindsight's 20-20."
274,00:12:00.97,00:12:03.37,"""So cash inon what you've learned"
275,00:12:03.37,00:12:04.73,"and get closer to the money."""
276,00:12:04.73,00:12:06.03,Okay.
277,00:12:06.03,00:12:07.77,"-Well, that's-that's obvious...-Yeah. -Yeah."
278,00:12:07.77,00:12:08.80,...what it is.
279,00:12:08.80,00:12:10.87,What?
280,00:12:10.87,00:12:12.30,"What we've learned, here."
281,00:12:12.30,00:12:13.23,"Oh, okay, yeah."
282,00:12:25.10,00:12:26.63,"-Hello, guys.-Hello, Jeff."
283,00:12:26.63,00:12:28.40,Hi.
284,00:12:28.40,00:12:31.97,"Okay, at this point in the game,with only three days left"
285,00:12:31.97,00:12:35.43,"and only four people left,the only way"
286,00:12:35.43,00:12:39.07,to control your fatein this game is with immunity.
287,00:12:39.07,00:12:41.47,So let's get to today'simmunity challenge.
288,00:12:41.47,00:12:44.87,"It is, appropriately enough,called Second Chance."
289,00:12:44.87,00:12:47.47,A chance to revisitcertain aspects of challenges
290,00:12:47.47,00:12:49.20, you have tackled in the past.
291,00:12:49.20,00:12:51.87," On my go, you will dig up a wicker ball."
292,00:12:51.87,00:12:55.57,Take that wicker ball with youover the bamboo balancing beam.
293,00:12:55.57,00:12:57.77," If you fall, you got to start over."
294,00:12:57.77,00:12:59.40," When you've succeeded, take your wicker ball"
295,00:12:59.40,00:13:00.50, through the fishnet tubing.
296,00:13:00.50,00:13:01.87, When you're finished with
297,00:13:01.87,00:13:03.50,"that part of the course,you're done with"
298,00:13:03.50,00:13:05.10, the wicker ball. You'll put it on your torch.
299,00:13:05.10,00:13:06.47,You'll begin workon the slide puzzle.
300,00:13:06.47,00:13:10.63," Once you release the knife, use the knife to cut the rope."
301,00:13:10.63,00:13:12.83, The rope will release a bag of materials.
302,00:13:12.83,00:13:14.67,Take those materials with youinto the jail cell.
303,00:13:14.67,00:13:17.13," Use the materials to build a pole,"
304,00:13:17.13,00:13:20.30," retrieve the key, unlock the door."
305,00:13:20.30,00:13:22.33," It's then a sprint to the final buffet table,"
306,00:13:22.33,00:13:26.73, where we have a surprise food item from our Thai menu.
307,00:13:26.73,00:13:28.27,First personto finish the course
308,00:13:28.27,00:13:29.80,and show me an empty mouth--
309,00:13:29.80,00:13:32.13,meaning you have consumedthe food item entirely--
310,00:13:32.13,00:13:34.33,"-(chuckles): Oh, Lord.-wins immunity,"
311,00:13:34.33,00:13:37.03,is guaranteed a spotin the final three.
312,00:13:37.03,00:13:39.30,Stakes have never been biggerthan this challenge.
313,00:13:39.30,00:13:40.57,-Make sense?-Yeah.
314,00:13:40.57,00:13:44.30,"Before we begin,Brian, I need that immunity."
315,00:13:47.37,00:13:49.80,Immunity back up for grabs.
316,00:13:49.80,00:13:51.33,Let's go.
317,00:13:51.33,00:13:52.50,"Here we go, guys.Immunity at stake"
318,00:13:52.50,00:13:55.07,and a guaranteed spotin the final three.
319,00:13:55.07,00:13:56.83,-Survivors ready?-Yeah.
320,00:13:56.83,00:13:58.03,Go!
321,00:14:10.00,00:14:12.40,Clay's the first one outwith his wicker ball.
322,00:14:12.40,00:14:13.53,Heading for the balance beam.
323,00:14:16.23,00:14:17.77,"-Back to the start, Clay.-Sand makes you slip."
324,00:14:17.77,00:14:19.83,"Jan has her ball, starting onthe bamboo balance beam."
325,00:14:19.83,00:14:22.77,Gets two steps in.
326,00:14:22.77,00:14:24.67,"Keep digging, guys."
327,00:14:24.67,00:14:27.27,"What, China?"
328,00:14:27.27,00:14:28.83,Clay's halfway.
329,00:14:28.83,00:14:31.17,Helen has her ball.
330,00:14:31.17,00:14:33.93,Clay's off the balance beam.
331,00:14:33.93,00:14:35.50,Clay is throughthe fishnet tubing.
332,00:14:35.50,00:14:36.50,"Not a big lead, guys."
333,00:14:36.50,00:14:37.80,Keep working it.
334,00:14:41.60,00:14:43.37,Brian's got his ball.
335,00:14:43.37,00:14:45.03,Everybody's on the bamboo.
336,00:14:45.03,00:14:46.43,Clay's just a little bit ahead.
337,00:14:46.43,00:14:47.73,"Keep moving, guys."
338,00:14:47.73,00:14:49.60,Still very much in this.
339,00:14:57.40,00:15:00.30,Brian's off the bambooand through the fishnet.
340,00:15:00.30,00:15:02.23,(mutters) Oh! Whoa!
341,00:15:02.23,00:15:06.10,"PROBST: Guys on the balancebeam, look where you're going."
342,00:15:08.70,00:15:11.27,Brian making his waythrough the fish tubing.
343,00:15:14.13,00:15:16.67,"Brian creeping up on you, Clay."
344,00:15:23.53,00:15:25.57,Way to keep fighting.
345,00:15:30.07,00:15:31.00,(screams)
346,00:15:43.00,00:15:45.17,Brian has his knife out.
347,00:15:45.17,00:15:47.80,Screwing up his puzzle so Claycan't look over and copy.
348,00:15:59.27,00:16:01.87,Brian's moving intothe jail cell.
349,00:16:01.87,00:16:04.37,"CLAY:I'm trying, I'm trying!"
350,00:16:04.37,00:16:07.87,PROBST: Brian's starting workon his pole.
351,00:16:07.87,00:16:10.60,"That a way, Helen. You're there.You're halfway there."
352,00:16:10.60,00:16:12.67,It's a sprint to the bottom now.
353,00:16:18.17,00:16:19.10,"Go, Jan."
354,00:16:28.30,00:16:30.70,Brian's got his key.
355,00:16:30.70,00:16:32.00,"That a way, Helen."
356,00:16:32.00,00:16:34.00,Right back in it.
357,00:16:38.13,00:16:40.83,Brian's out of the jail cell.
358,00:16:42.13,00:16:44.07,Hallelujah!
359,00:16:44.07,00:16:45.87,"-That a way, Janny!-Yes!"
360,00:16:57.00,00:16:58.23,Got to eat it all?
361,00:16:58.23,00:17:00.23,"PROBST:You got to eat it all, brother."
362,00:17:00.23,00:17:01.90,Don't mess around.
363,00:17:06.23,00:17:08.10,Put that thing downand start chewing.
364,00:17:11.87,00:17:12.97,Keep it down.
365,00:17:21.57,00:17:24.13,Let me see that whole mouth.
366,00:17:24.13,00:17:25.87,Brian wins immunity!
367,00:17:28.97,00:17:31.00,That was nasty.
368,00:17:42.73,00:17:44.87,You have come a long way.
369,00:17:44.87,00:17:47.37,One of you will go no further.
370,00:17:47.37,00:17:49.53,Somebody's going homeafter Tribal Council.
371,00:18:19.03,00:18:21.40,"Oh, boy."
372,00:18:21.40,00:18:22.67,"Even as I was doing it,"
373,00:18:22.67,00:18:26.07,I could feel myselfgetting so angry I was shaking.
374,00:18:26.07,00:18:27.67,HELEN: I hate to lose.
375,00:18:27.67,00:18:28.53,I hate to lose.
376,00:18:28.53,00:18:32.00,"And I hate to look like a fooldoing it, and I did both today."
377,00:18:32.00,00:18:33.57,That damn balance thing.
378,00:18:33.57,00:18:35.17,I just felt likeI looked like an idiot.
379,00:18:35.17,00:18:36.83," Ever since the immunity challenge was over,"
380,00:18:36.83,00:18:38.67,"the minute I knewI didn't have it,"
381,00:18:38.67,00:18:40.40,"I was like, okay, now what?"
382,00:18:45.93,00:18:48.37,BRIAN: It looks like it's time for Helen to go.
383,00:18:48.37,00:18:52.03,Why Helen now at this time is--
384,00:18:52.03,00:18:54.53,there was some sort ofrelationship with her and Ted;
385,00:18:54.53,00:18:56.23,it just happened the other day.
386,00:18:56.23,00:18:58.40, There was some writing on the ground.
387,00:18:58.40,00:19:01.40, So I have a little distrust in Helen.
388,00:19:01.40,00:19:02.80,I know they werescheming against us.
389,00:19:02.80,00:19:04.60,"I mean,Jan was supposedly sleeping,"
390,00:19:04.60,00:19:06.13,they were doing stuffin the dirt here.
391,00:19:06.13,00:19:07.50,"-Oh, I saw... I saw writing.-Placing in order."
392,00:19:07.50,00:19:09.07,"When I raised up and looked,they started playing like"
393,00:19:09.07,00:19:10.43,they was playing Tic Tac Toe.
394,00:19:10.43,00:19:12.03,It's some sort of orderthey were going.
395,00:19:12.03,00:19:14.57,"So that, uh-- I know that,uh, Helen's"
396,00:19:14.57,00:19:16.77,"-going to go down fightingtomorrow, no matter what. -Yeah."
397,00:19:16.77,00:19:19.37,"She's a threat, and she's makingme nervous now with everything"
398,00:19:19.37,00:19:20.93,the same and I'm not still inthe picture and--
399,00:19:20.93,00:19:22.27,I'm just getting--she's making me nervous.
400,00:19:22.27,00:19:23.87,"BRIAN: Helen's got to go now,"
401,00:19:23.87,00:19:26.40,simply becauseshe's a threat to me.
402,00:19:26.40,00:19:29.43,"Jan, you know wherethe vote's going, correct?"
403,00:19:29.43,00:19:30.90,-Me?-No.
404,00:19:30.90,00:19:32.13,Who?
405,00:19:32.13,00:19:34.43,-Helen.-No.
406,00:19:34.43,00:19:36.93,I-- this is the firstI've heard of it.
407,00:19:36.93,00:19:39.40,"This is strictly strategy,just think about it."
408,00:19:41.93,00:19:45.13,It's not your turn.
409,00:19:47.10,00:19:49.77,"BRIAN: Jan-- she's my ace in the hole,"
410,00:19:49.77,00:19:51.43," and I will use her, uh, tonight."
411,00:19:51.43,00:19:53.90,"As long aseverything goes as planned,"
412,00:19:53.90,00:19:55.77,she'll come into play.
413,00:19:55.77,00:19:58.73,"Now, whether, uh, whethereverything does go as planned,"
414,00:19:58.73,00:20:00.90,that's one thingI can't control.
415,00:20:00.90,00:20:02.90,You can't get emotionalover this decision.
416,00:20:02.90,00:20:04.43,-Right. -It's strictlya strategic position.
417,00:20:04.43,00:20:06.10,-Right.-But if you're not
418,00:20:06.10,00:20:09.17,"comfortable with it, then-then,uh, I-I understand, also."
419,00:20:09.17,00:20:12.20,"But I would, uh, just like youto, uh, think about it,"
420,00:20:12.20,00:20:14.10,"and that's, I mean,that's the way"
421,00:20:14.10,00:20:15.63,"we would, uh,kind of like to go."
422,00:20:15.63,00:20:18.03,"-Right.-I mentioned it, also, to Clay."
423,00:20:18.03,00:20:21.30,"You understand, you're-- it'llbe helping your pocketbook, too."
424,00:20:21.30,00:20:23.50,And it's you or her.
425,00:20:23.50,00:20:26.47,"I just, you know,I don't want y'all to be saying,"
426,00:20:26.47,00:20:28.63,"""We're putting Jan out""and then, you know..."
427,00:20:28.63,00:20:30.10,"I'm not... I'm not playing agame. No, we're not playing--"
428,00:20:30.10,00:20:31.73,I'm going to take her outin about an hour
429,00:20:31.73,00:20:33.17,-Uh-huh.-and talk to her.
430,00:20:33.17,00:20:34.50,You have to just understand that
431,00:20:34.50,00:20:36.40,you're now-- can be three.
432,00:20:36.40,00:20:38.33,-Mm-hmm.-Which is quite a feat.
433,00:20:38.33,00:20:41.10,But the time has cometo make a decision.
434,00:20:41.10,00:20:45.47,"And, uh... it's Helen's time."
435,00:20:45.47,00:20:47.83,Are you okay with that?
436,00:20:47.83,00:20:51.50,"I just want to think about itand see, and, um,"
437,00:20:51.50,00:20:55.47,"you know, I'm just, I'm justgoing to ponder what's going on."
438,00:20:55.47,00:20:57.43,"Is that a deal, Jan?"
439,00:20:57.43,00:21:00.73,"Let me just, let me just takea nap and rest on it, guys."
440,00:21:00.73,00:21:01.73,"Yeah, I'll think about it."
441,00:21:01.73,00:21:03.17,And I'd appreciate you--
442,00:21:03.17,00:21:04.33,"-Thanks, guys.-Get... Get some rest."
443,00:21:04.33,00:21:05.43,"No, thank you, Jan."
444,00:21:05.43,00:21:08.23,"Oh, my one cellis being very overworked."
445,00:21:08.23,00:21:09.53,-(laughs)-It's all strategy.
446,00:21:09.53,00:21:11.60,That's all it is.
447,00:21:11.60,00:21:15.50,"Oh, God,I'm going to kill myself."
448,00:21:15.50,00:21:17.37,I have been approached
449,00:21:17.37,00:21:20.70,"for a new game plan, and,"
450,00:21:20.70,00:21:24.50," um, I am toying with the suggestion."
451,00:21:24.50,00:21:26.57, Helen is a friend of mine.
452,00:21:26.57,00:21:28.03," She has cooked the meals,"
453,00:21:28.03,00:21:31.00, she sings at night to help calm us down.
454,00:21:31.00,00:21:32.70, So I feel like I'm in a quandary.
455,00:21:32.70,00:21:34.87,That makes me anxious.
456,00:21:34.87,00:21:37.23,She can't change her mind.
457,00:21:37.23,00:21:39.20,"What we'll do, we'll changeour vote and vote her."
458,00:21:39.20,00:21:41.27,"I think she'll be okay,she just needs to relax."
459,00:21:41.27,00:21:42.57,I don't know.
460,00:21:42.57,00:21:44.37,Hope it works.
461,00:21:47.30,00:21:49.73,The only other issue is
462,00:21:49.73,00:21:52.63,"what I'm going to tell Helen,if I, if I'm going to."
463,00:21:52.63,00:21:55.10,It's going to pop up her namethree times
464,00:21:55.10,00:21:56.60,"and she'll get the message,for sure then."
465,00:22:01.63,00:22:03.07,"HELEN: Weeks ago, Brian and Clay"
466,00:22:03.07,00:22:07.93,"came to me and said, uh, ""Howabout us three for the top?"""
467,00:22:07.93,00:22:11.90," The vote that was agreed upon was start with Ted, then Jan,"
468,00:22:11.90,00:22:14.53," then when we get to us three, then we'll reevaluate."
469,00:22:14.53,00:22:16.00," Well, I know darn well Clay sees himself"
470,00:22:16.00,00:22:17.37, in those first two chairs.
471,00:22:17.37,00:22:21.13, So it worries me that they may decide that Jan
472,00:22:21.13,00:22:24.40," is an easier person to keep along, so I"
473,00:22:24.40,00:22:28.27,checked last night to make sureit was still a Ted vote-- yes.
474,00:22:28.27,00:22:31.20,"Okay. Checked today with bothof them, it's still a Jan vote."
475,00:22:31.20,00:22:33.17,"Now, you can ask him.Don't you think you ought"
476,00:22:33.17,00:22:36.63,to just not talkabout it with Janny?
477,00:22:36.63,00:22:38.77,You think it's fairto tell Jan she's going?
478,00:22:38.77,00:22:40.37,CLAY:I think you ought to leave...
479,00:22:40.37,00:22:41.80,That just makes herupset all day.
480,00:22:41.80,00:22:44.23,"Soon as we got here,she went back down in the cave."
481,00:22:44.23,00:22:47.30,Just let her by herselfand let her get through the day.
482,00:22:47.30,00:22:48.90,Don't upset her.
483,00:22:48.90,00:22:50.50,HELEN: Brian and Clay have had it with Jan.
484,00:22:50.50,00:22:52.73," They're frustrated with her. I mean, that's the story"
485,00:22:52.73,00:22:54.93,they're giving me and that it'sa definite
486,00:22:54.93,00:22:56.97, she's out tonight.
487,00:23:26.57,00:23:27.67,We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
488,00:23:27.67,00:23:30.70,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake"
489,00:23:30.70,00:23:32.43,"and our newest jury member, Ted,"
490,00:23:32.43,00:23:35.03,voted out atthe last Tribal Council.
491,00:23:36.83,00:23:40.63,"Just before we votedat the last Tribal Council,"
492,00:23:40.63,00:23:44.63,"I asked, at the time the five ofyou, if anybody felt vulnerable."
493,00:23:44.63,00:23:46.07,"Everybody shook their headand I said,"
494,00:23:46.07,00:23:48.13,"""So that must meaneverybody feels safe,"
495,00:23:48.13,00:23:50.77,"which means somebodyis clearly being lied to."""
496,00:23:50.77,00:23:52.97,"And from where I sit, they were."
497,00:23:52.97,00:23:56.07,"You voted out Ted, and I don'tthink he saw it coming."
498,00:23:56.07,00:23:59.33,So now we have a jury made up of
499,00:23:59.33,00:24:03.50,"four Sook Jai members and one ofyour own Chuay Gahn members,"
500,00:24:03.50,00:24:06.53,"for all intents and purposes,you betrayed."
501,00:24:06.53,00:24:09.07,"Clay, smart wayto play this game,"
502,00:24:09.07,00:24:12.37,knowing your fateis in their hands?
503,00:24:12.37,00:24:14.60,"Uh, I wouldn't call it betrayed."
504,00:24:14.60,00:24:17.40,"I mean, everybody has to beremoved from the game"
505,00:24:17.40,00:24:18.80,to get down to the final two.
506,00:24:18.80,00:24:21.43,That's the waythis game is played.
507,00:24:21.43,00:24:23.47,"And, uh, lying ispart of the game."
508,00:24:23.47,00:24:26.10,This a-a-a gameof people playing people.
509,00:24:26.10,00:24:28.97,Who do you trustby looking them in the eye?
510,00:24:28.97,00:24:30.23,I'm sure I've said some things
511,00:24:30.23,00:24:32.07,where I wanted peopleto take them another way.
512,00:24:32.07,00:24:34.70,"-It kept Clay in the game.-PROBST: So, Jan,"
513,00:24:34.70,00:24:37.93,you basically lookedanother tribe member in the eye
514,00:24:37.93,00:24:39.03,and lied to them.
515,00:24:39.03,00:24:40.30,They're now on the other side.
516,00:24:40.30,00:24:42.40,"Well, I didn't lie to him."
517,00:24:42.40,00:24:45.30,I just votedto keep myself in the game.
518,00:24:45.30,00:24:47.63,So maybe I'm makingan assumption.
519,00:24:47.63,00:24:50.00,"So, then, was it a coincidencethat everybody"
520,00:24:50.00,00:24:51.73,voted for Ted except Ted?
521,00:24:51.73,00:24:53.00,(chuckles)
522,00:24:53.00,00:24:55.83,"Uh... uh, I-I have...I don't know."
523,00:24:55.83,00:24:59.87,"I don't think so, but I did notsay one thing to Ted"
524,00:24:59.87,00:25:02.07,about going to vote against him.
525,00:25:02.07,00:25:04.93,"But he did not ask me, either."
526,00:25:04.93,00:25:06.57,"Brian, have you liedin this game?"
527,00:25:06.57,00:25:07.77,"No, I've not lied."
528,00:25:07.77,00:25:09.43,"I've, uh, changed my minda few times."
529,00:25:09.43,00:25:11.13,"There's been, uh,certain situations"
530,00:25:11.13,00:25:13.43,"where things could have beenput out in the open,"
531,00:25:13.43,00:25:16.73,"friendships could haveremained blossoming, but, uh,"
532,00:25:16.73,00:25:18.40,some people have chosento take other routes
533,00:25:18.40,00:25:21.90,"and have, uh, decidedto actually, uh..."
534,00:25:21.90,00:25:24.77,"uh, to deceive."
535,00:25:24.77,00:25:26.67,So you thinkyou've been lied to?
536,00:25:26.67,00:25:28.50,Yes. I've been deceived.
537,00:25:28.50,00:25:32.80,"And that's expected to happen,and, uh, it just..."
538,00:25:32.80,00:25:35.63,"you don't think it's goingto happen, uh, to you."
539,00:25:35.63,00:25:37.00,"Helen,think you've been lied to?"
540,00:25:37.00,00:25:39.00,"Oh, I know I've been lied to."
541,00:25:40.90,00:25:41.93,"Clay,think you've been lied to?"
542,00:25:41.93,00:25:43.73,Know for a factI've been lied to.
543,00:25:43.73,00:25:46.50,"And, uh, I just dealt thema card right back."
544,00:25:46.50,00:25:49.30,PROBST: So how is thereany loyalty at all
545,00:25:49.30,00:25:51.23,-in this game at this point?-CLAY: There's not.
546,00:25:51.23,00:25:53.13,The only safe movein this game--
547,00:25:53.13,00:25:55.63,"if you got that necklace on,and that's it."
548,00:25:55.63,00:25:57.60,We're three vulnerableright now.
549,00:25:57.60,00:25:59.53,He's safe; we're not.
550,00:25:59.53,00:26:02.70,"So, clearly, Helen,at this point,"
551,00:26:02.70,00:26:05.60,how can you trustany of these people
552,00:26:05.60,00:26:06.90,when you walk up there to vote?
553,00:26:06.90,00:26:09.23,You can't.
554,00:26:09.23,00:26:10.53,"Flat out, you can't."
555,00:26:10.53,00:26:12.80,"It's getting downto the wire, and, um,"
556,00:26:12.80,00:26:16.23,"you tell someone honestly, ""Thisis who I'm voting for tonight,"""
557,00:26:16.23,00:26:18.87,"and then, all of a sudden,maybe right before the vote,"
558,00:26:18.87,00:26:21.80,"you get a signal from your bloc,"
559,00:26:21.80,00:26:24.53,"""Uh-uh, that's not the way we'regoing; we're going this way."""
560,00:26:24.53,00:26:26.53,"And then you go, ""Oh, great."""
561,00:26:26.53,00:26:29.47,"This person now says,""You lied."""
562,00:26:29.47,00:26:31.70,"And, to them,that's the way it is."
563,00:26:31.70,00:26:33.83,So let me ask you the samequestion I asked Jan earlier.
564,00:26:33.83,00:26:37.03,"Was it coincidence that Tedended up with all the votes,"
565,00:26:37.03,00:26:39.43,or was there one of these blocs?
566,00:26:39.43,00:26:41.20,It was a bloc.
567,00:26:41.20,00:26:44.40,"Clay, knowing you're alreadya little in trouble"
568,00:26:44.40,00:26:46.10,"with four Sook Jai members,"
569,00:26:46.10,00:26:49.07,"maybe we should tell Tedhe's still going,"
570,00:26:49.07,00:26:51.53,and maybe we'd get a littleloyalty from him in the end.
571,00:26:51.53,00:26:54.53,"Uh, I looked at this way--I wouldn't want to know,"
572,00:26:54.53,00:26:57.33,"and, uh, I need to get ridof the biggest people"
573,00:26:57.33,00:26:59.47,that I feel most threatened by.
574,00:26:59.47,00:27:02.03,We're not talking $20;we're talking a million dollars.
575,00:27:02.03,00:27:04.37,And you're not judgedon your... your lying
576,00:27:04.37,00:27:06.77,or your performance on this gameas you are in life.
577,00:27:06.77,00:27:08.60,"This is a game,and, uh, we're here"
578,00:27:08.60,00:27:10.87,to play it the best we canand win.
579,00:27:10.87,00:27:12.37,It is time to vote.Brian.
580,00:27:25.47,00:27:27.37,Cause and effect.
581,00:27:27.37,00:27:29.30,You caused this effect.
582,00:28:05.60,00:28:09.20,"You got busted, uh, talkingon both sides of the fence."
583,00:28:09.20,00:28:11.93,"You're a hell of a cook,and I'll miss you,"
584,00:28:11.93,00:28:14.27,but I will kiss the cooklater in life.
585,00:28:14.27,00:28:16.03,Good-bye.
586,00:28:17.17,00:28:18.73,I'll go tally the votes.
587,00:28:29.90,00:28:32.43,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
588,00:28:32.43,00:28:33.73,The personwill be asked to leave
589,00:28:33.73,00:28:34.93,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
590,00:28:34.93,00:28:36.60,I'll read the votes.
591,00:28:38.33,00:28:39.77,First vote.
592,00:28:42.93,00:28:45.63,Helen.
593,00:28:47.53,00:28:49.43,Helen.
594,00:28:49.43,00:28:52.20,That's two votes-- Helen.
595,00:28:54.37,00:28:56.57,Jan.
596,00:28:59.73,00:29:01.77,The 13th member voted outof the tribe:
597,00:29:01.77,00:29:03.77,Helen.
598,00:29:03.77,00:29:05.60,Need to bring me your torch.
599,00:29:15.90,00:29:17.60,"Helen, the tribe has spoken."
600,00:29:20.27,00:29:21.90,It's time for you to go.
601,00:29:36.53,00:29:39.67,You've lasted 37very tough days.
602,00:29:39.67,00:29:42.30,You've made itto the final three.
603,00:29:42.30,00:29:44.83,And tomorrow will be oneof the most memorable days yet.
604,00:29:44.83,00:29:47.87,So head back to camp.Get some sleep.
605,00:29:50.10,00:29:51.47,"Well, that was a shock."
606,00:29:51.47,00:29:54.17,"Um, especially since I asked,"
607,00:29:54.17,00:29:58.30," uh, Brian directly if I should plan on coming back tonight"
608,00:29:58.30,00:30:00.90, and I was given an emphatic yes.
609,00:30:00.90,00:30:03.40,"So I guess, of the three knives in my back right now,"
610,00:30:03.40,00:30:05.93," uh, that's the one that smarts the most."
611,00:30:05.93,00:30:08.50,"So, uh, the three of youthat are left, break a leg."
612,00:30:08.50,00:30:10.03,And I mean it.
613,00:30:24.03,00:30:28.03,CLAY: A very memorableand emotional day.
614,00:30:28.03,00:30:30.20,"JAN (sighs):Thank you, guys."
615,00:30:30.20,00:30:32.20,CLAY:You're welcome. Thank you.
616,00:30:32.20,00:30:35.37,"JAN: When we came back as the final three,"
617,00:30:35.37,00:30:38.60,it was one of thosegood/sad things for me.
618,00:30:38.60,00:30:40.37,"-Thank you, Brian.-Thank you."
619,00:30:43.37,00:30:45.93,JAN: I felt a little empty without Helen
620,00:30:45.93,00:30:47.90," because I thought she had worked hard,"
621,00:30:47.90,00:30:51.40,"and, um, I thought she stilldeserved one of the places."
622,00:30:51.40,00:30:52.80,"BRIAN: I didn't thinkHelen would lose it,"
623,00:30:52.80,00:30:54.17,but she actually lost itthe last couple days.
624,00:30:54.17,00:30:55.93,"-She did.-I... I didn't, either."
625,00:30:55.93,00:30:57.63,"I mean, everything was fine"
626,00:30:57.63,00:31:00.10,"up until, uh, recently,then all of a sudden,"
627,00:31:00.10,00:31:02.40,she got real antsyand nervous and sketchy.
628,00:31:02.40,00:31:04.93,"CLAY: When, uh, Helen saw hername pop up for the third time,"
629,00:31:04.93,00:31:07.57, I hope it felt like a truck hit her right in the stomach.
630,00:31:07.57,00:31:09.30, Whammo! We slapped you right in front
631,00:31:09.30,00:31:11.87,"of your Council members.And, uh, you know what?"
632,00:31:11.87,00:31:13.67,"You still got to votefor one of us,"
633,00:31:13.67,00:31:15.27,"and all three of usvoted for you,"
634,00:31:15.27,00:31:17.00,so who you going to blame?
635,00:31:17.00,00:31:18.77,Let's just kind of hold here...
636,00:31:18.77,00:31:20.43,Watch your toes.Watch your feet.
637,00:31:20.43,00:31:22.67,"JAN: We got back from Tribal Council,"
638,00:31:22.67,00:31:24.73," then all of a sudden, we had treemail."
639,00:31:24.73,00:31:26.30,"Um, okay,I'm going to go in here."
640,00:31:26.30,00:31:27.63,On top? Oh...
641,00:31:27.63,00:31:29.07,"Here's... Oh. Oh, my gosh."
642,00:31:29.07,00:31:30.57,-JAN: What is it?-That was quick.
643,00:31:30.57,00:31:31.80,-What is it?-Look.
644,00:31:31.80,00:31:33.07,I don't see it.
645,00:31:33.07,00:31:34.70,"Oh, no, it's Helen's riverboat."
646,00:31:34.70,00:31:37.13,"Oh, it's just... that's awful."
647,00:31:37.13,00:31:40.47,"JAN: We went down there, and there was, uh, Helen's thing"
648,00:31:40.47,00:31:42.40, for us to make to float down the river.
649,00:31:42.40,00:31:44.13, I felt a little bit bad.
650,00:31:44.13,00:31:45.57,I just thought it was real soon
651,00:31:45.57,00:31:47.90,to be feelinglike you buried someone.
652,00:31:49.90,00:31:53.77,"Okay. ""Before you sleep,make one last krathong"
653,00:31:53.77,00:31:55.90,"in memory of the personyou've just set adrift."""
654,00:31:55.90,00:31:58.77,-Okay. -What about gettingover here and we'll start it?
655,00:31:58.77,00:32:01.13,I'm going to tie a spoon--
656,00:32:01.13,00:32:05.13,"one of the spoons that wecook with-- around her, uh, lei."
657,00:32:05.13,00:32:07.43,JAN: And I wanted to make sure that we
658,00:32:07.43,00:32:10.37," did a good one, you know, so we put a spoon on it"
659,00:32:10.37,00:32:12.70,"'cause, uh, of her cookingand everything."
660,00:32:12.70,00:32:15.67,CLAY:Here we go.
661,00:32:15.67,00:32:16.83,"No, that's a good idea, I think,with the spoon."
662,00:32:16.83,00:32:18.30,"-JAN: I thought so, too.-Yeah."
663,00:32:18.30,00:32:19.97,BRIAN: I wanted to make sure she had a proper burial.
664,00:32:19.97,00:32:21.43,"I called her my Aunt Helen,"
665,00:32:21.43,00:32:23.97,"but I almost felt closer to her,like somewhat of a sister,"
666,00:32:23.97,00:32:26.50,but I'm wondering now if she'sthe sister that went bad.
667,00:32:56.43,00:32:57.97,"BRIAN:That is a beautiful, uh, sight."
668,00:32:57.97,00:32:59.97,CLAY: Looks like a picturesomebody painted.
669,00:32:59.97,00:33:01.63,"-BRIAN: Yeah, it does.-JAN: Uh-huh."
670,00:33:01.63,00:33:05.00,"I swear, look at the red linesgoing straight here to us."
671,00:33:05.00,00:33:07.73,That is too cool.
672,00:33:07.73,00:33:10.00,"Wish I had a belly full of food,but I don't."
673,00:33:10.00,00:33:11.63,And some coffee.
674,00:33:11.63,00:33:13.80,"CLAY: Me, Brian and Jan, we're just sitting there talking,"
675,00:33:13.80,00:33:15.80," and I was playing like I was, uh..."
676,00:33:15.80,00:33:17.50, started drinking a cup of coffee.
677,00:33:17.50,00:33:19.93,"And I said, ""Oh, by the way,I got some donuts over here."""
678,00:33:19.93,00:33:21.33," So I passed out the donuts,"
679,00:33:21.33,00:33:23.43, and we were just eating donuts and drinking coffee--
680,00:33:23.43,00:33:25.37," like, we were just really getting our belly full."
681,00:33:25.37,00:33:27.10,"-We got three pancakes,two eggs, -Bacon."
682,00:33:27.10,00:33:29.10,"one strip of bacon,small glass of orange juice"
683,00:33:29.10,00:33:30.93,and a cup of coffee.
684,00:33:30.93,00:33:32.57,Ask... go aheadand send me my breakfast.
685,00:33:32.57,00:33:35.77,I want the pancakesand the bacon and the sausage.
686,00:33:38.60,00:33:39.67,There's a canoe.
687,00:33:39.67,00:33:41.50,"Wait, there's a boat!"
688,00:33:41.50,00:33:43.53,-Who is that?-There's a canoe out there.
689,00:33:43.53,00:33:45.83,"CLAY: All of a sudden, we see this boat pull up."
690,00:33:45.83,00:33:47.37,It's Jeff!
691,00:33:47.37,00:33:49.47, There's Jeff standing up in that... this little boat
692,00:33:49.47,00:33:52.33," had three, uh, uh, umbrellas on it."
693,00:33:52.33,00:33:53.70,"Hey, guys."
694,00:33:53.70,00:33:55.90,Welcome to our home.

700,00:34:07.10,00:34:10.23,"You will leave your beach,paddling north,"
701,00:34:10.23,00:34:12.67, out around the island to the Mangrove River.
702,00:34:12.67,00:34:14.10," When you reach the river,"

743,00:40:10.77,00:40:14.57,It's fittingthat this final ordeal plays out
744,00:40:14.57,00:40:17.63,here in the darkest partof a cave that was once the home
745,00:40:17.63,00:40:20.10,to the pirateswho ruled this island.

749,00:40:30.20,00:40:32.57,trusting when you shouldn't.
750,00:40:32.57,00:40:35.53,13 of your fellow Survivorshave done just that.
751,00:40:35.53,00:40:38.60,The three of youare still holding on.
752,00:40:38.60,00:40:42.00,"The question is,for how much longer?"
753,00:40:42.00,00:40:43.07,That's right.
754,00:40:43.07,00:40:44.60,Today's challenge is simple.
755,00:40:44.60,00:40:46.70,Don't let the money slipthrough your fingers.

757,00:40:50.43,00:40:52.47,"three for your left hand,three for your right."
758,00:40:52.47,00:40:54.87, You'll put the coins between your fingers
759,00:40:54.87,00:40:57.00, and keep them there. You will then
760,00:40:57.00,00:41:00.50,"go into a traditional Thaistance called the khon,"
761,00:41:00.50,00:41:03.73,and you will stand in thisposition with the coins
762,00:41:03.73,00:41:06.50,between your fingersfor the duration
763,00:41:06.50,00:41:07.50, of the challenge.
764,00:41:07.50,00:41:10.37, The frames behind you will force you to stay in place.
765,00:41:10.37,00:41:11.67, It will be uncomfortable.
766,00:41:11.67,00:41:15.90,"It will grow to be painful,especially for your legs."
767,00:41:15.90,00:41:17.37,You will want to quit.
768,00:41:17.37,00:41:19.30,It's a test of your willpower.
769,00:41:19.30,00:41:21.50,"And the longer you last,the more difficult"
770,00:41:21.50,00:41:23.33,it becomes to achieve your goal.
771,00:41:23.33,00:41:25.33,"Slowly, those coins will begin"
772,00:41:25.33,00:41:27.40, to fall through your fingers.
773,00:41:27.40,00:41:31.17,When all six of your coinshave fallen through your fingers
774,00:41:31.17,00:41:32.77," into the wok below,"

778,00:41:39.77,00:41:41.47,"and with that immunity,"
779,00:41:41.47,00:41:45.40,gets to decide who comeswith them to that final vote.
780,00:41:45.40,00:41:47.40,Stakes have never been bigger.
781,00:41:47.40,00:41:48.90,Concentration needs to be keen.
782,00:41:48.90,00:41:50.50,Block out everything else.
783,00:41:50.50,00:41:52.67,I'm gonna ask you nowto come forward one at a time
784,00:41:52.67,00:41:53.77,and grab six coins.
785,00:41:53.77,00:41:55.00,"Jan, you first."

789,00:42:05.30,00:42:06.83,I'm going to ask youto take your coins
790,00:42:06.83,00:42:10.17,"and put them between yourfingers, three on each hand."
791,00:42:10.17,00:42:12.53,Center them up.
792,00:42:12.53,00:42:15.23,I want you to step uponto your platform.
793,00:42:15.23,00:42:17.70,"Put your head,your hands and your feet"
794,00:42:17.70,00:42:21.23,"in the brackets,palms facing up."
795,00:42:28.63,00:42:32.87,"Guys, for the last time,immunity is back up for grabs."
796,00:42:32.87,00:42:35.00,Challenge is on.
797,00:42:52.33,00:42:55.47,There'll be someinitial discomfort.
798,00:42:55.47,00:42:57.27,It'll turn into pain.
799,00:42:57.27,00:43:00.33,"But if you use your mind right,you'll block it out."
800,00:43:00.33,00:43:03.00,"Get into a good zone,you'll be all right."
801,00:43:09.07,00:43:10.87,"Jan, what do you reckon's"
802,00:43:10.87,00:43:13.40,the first thing you'regoing to do when you get home?
803,00:43:13.40,00:43:15.67,"First thing I get away fromhere, I'm having four beers--"
804,00:43:15.67,00:43:17.63,"two in each hand--and a big, fat pizza."
805,00:43:17.63,00:43:19.43,"That's exactlywhat I'm going to do,"
806,00:43:19.43,00:43:21.63,and try and find some suckerwith a cigar
807,00:43:21.63,00:43:23.80,"and con it off of him,"
808,00:43:23.80,00:43:25.57,and then laugh.
809,00:43:26.90,00:43:29.00,"PROBST: Brian, what are youthinking right now?"
810,00:43:29.00,00:43:30.37,I'm just relaxing.
811,00:43:30.37,00:43:31.80,-All right.-Thank you.
812,00:43:31.80,00:43:33.67,"Clay, what are you going to dowhen you get out of here?"
813,00:43:33.67,00:43:35.63,What's the first action you'regoing to take when you get home?
814,00:43:35.63,00:43:38.47,Get something fatteningand hug the hell out of my wife.
815,00:43:38.47,00:43:40.93,She's supposed to have a piewaiting in the car for me.
816,00:43:55.43,00:43:56.97,You guys are doing great.
817,00:44:08.47,00:44:10.23,This is the point where itstarts to get
818,00:44:10.23,00:44:12.67,a little painful.Work through it.
819,00:44:25.63,00:44:29.13,"Stay focusedon your own game, guys."
820,00:44:45.47,00:44:47.33,It is designed to hurt.
821,00:44:47.33,00:44:49.73,It's designedto test your willpower.
822,00:44:49.73,00:44:52.60,You're at the hardest partright now.
823,00:44:53.90,00:44:57.23,You are in the darkest partof this challenge.
824,00:45:03.07,00:45:06.43,You guys have come way too farto give in now.
825,00:45:09.47,00:45:13.00,"Remember, guys, it's alsoimportant to stay in your game"
826,00:45:13.00,00:45:16.40,mentally in relationto the other players.
827,00:45:16.40,00:45:17.87,The image you put forth
828,00:45:17.87,00:45:21.10,affects them-- gives them poweror takes it away.
829,00:45:31.63,00:45:33.43,I can't. I can't.
830,00:45:33.43,00:45:35.03,I'm sorry. I can't.
831,00:45:36.13,00:45:38.10,I can't.That was me.
832,00:45:46.67,00:45:48.27,"Sit down, guys.Have a seat."
833,00:45:48.27,00:45:49.57,"-Stretch it out.-Way to go, Brian."
834,00:45:49.57,00:45:50.67,Time to... time to get out.
835,00:45:50.67,00:45:53.23,-Okay. Everyone gone?-Yeah.
836,00:45:53.23,00:45:54.30,"PROBST:It's yours, Brian."
837,00:46:01.70,00:46:03.03,"Good job, guys."
838,00:46:03.03,00:46:04.53,"CLAY:Way to go, Jan."
839,00:46:04.53,00:46:06.13,You gave it all you got.
840,00:46:06.13,00:46:08.00,Way to go.
841,00:46:09.50,00:46:12.83,"For the third time in a row,take it."
842,00:46:16.77,00:46:18.77,-CLAY: Feel good?-Yeah. Thanks.
843,00:46:18.77,00:46:21.37,"PROBST: All right, guys,here's where we're at."
844,00:46:21.37,00:46:23.13,"For the third time,Brian has immunity"
845,00:46:23.13,00:46:25.53,and a very big decision to make:
846,00:46:25.53,00:46:29.30,which one of you two to takewith him to the final vote.
847,00:46:29.30,00:46:31.10,That's what you haveto think about today.
848,00:46:31.10,00:46:34.03,I will see the three of youtonight at Tribal Council.
849,00:46:34.03,00:46:35.70,Take your torches.
850,00:46:35.70,00:46:37.57,Make your way back to camp.
851,00:47:16.23,00:47:17.77,What a morning.
852,00:47:17.77,00:47:19.80,"You guys, are your legsstill like rubber?"
853,00:47:19.80,00:47:21.43,CLAY:Still really hurt.
854,00:47:21.43,00:47:24.33,"JAN: Today, walking into the last challenge,"
855,00:47:24.33,00:47:27.70," I knew I had to beat Brian and Clay, but my legs"
856,00:47:27.70,00:47:30.60,"were just quivering like that,and I had sweat coming down,"
857,00:47:30.60,00:47:35.50,"and, uh... um, I just couldn'ttake myself to that next level."
858,00:47:40.83,00:47:43.57,BRIAN:Wow. What a dramatic challenge.
859,00:47:43.57,00:47:47.20,(thunder crashes)
860,00:47:47.20,00:47:49.93,That's what I felt like.That's just what I felt like.
861,00:47:49.93,00:47:52.23,That's... my whole body feltlike lightning going through it.
862,00:47:56.73,00:47:58.93,There was a major burn going on all throughout the legs.
863,00:47:58.93,00:48:01.80," Then it went to the butt, the lower back and the neck."
864,00:48:01.80,00:48:03.73," But I made it through and, uh,"
865,00:48:03.73,00:48:06.17, took that immunity home for the third time in a row.
866,00:48:17.07,00:48:20.17,CLAY: This is our final Tribal Council before there's two
867,00:48:20.17,00:48:22.13, that's going to have to sit before the jury.
868,00:48:22.13,00:48:24.30, I feel very confident that Brian's gonna go in
869,00:48:24.30,00:48:27.30, and set Jan on the jury as the seventh member
870,00:48:27.30,00:48:29.63," and I'm going to set up there as, uh,"
871,00:48:29.63,00:48:31.57,one-two and letthe jury vote on us
872,00:48:31.57,00:48:33.17,"and, uh, seewho gets the million."
873,00:48:38.63,00:48:40.50,BRIAN: I'm thinking about the whole picture.
874,00:48:40.50,00:48:41.80, Simple as that.
875,00:48:41.80,00:48:45.13," I-I know it's a $900,000 mistake"
876,00:48:45.13,00:48:48.90,"I could be making, but there'sa lot... a lot here at stake."
877,00:48:48.90,00:48:50.50, Putting me up against
878,00:48:50.50,00:48:53.00," a 53-year-old lady that's done not much,"
879,00:48:53.00,00:48:56.57, yet she hasn't done anything to step on anybody's feet.
880,00:48:56.57,00:48:59.53," Clay's played the game very similar to me, so I'm not sure"
881,00:48:59.53,00:49:01.67,of how the votes are going togo; I really don't know.
882,00:49:04.43,00:49:07.43,Get your little rod.
883,00:49:07.43,00:49:09.73,CLAY: The only reason I can think Brian
884,00:49:09.73,00:49:12.37, taking Jan to the final two-- it'd be an easier win.
885,00:49:12.37,00:49:14.20, He-he may walk up there and just
886,00:49:14.20,00:49:15.70,blow me right out of the water.
887,00:49:15.70,00:49:17.87,"I mean, we... me and himhave blown two out of the water"
888,00:49:17.87,00:49:20.37,in the last two Tribal Councils that just absolutely thought
889,00:49:20.37,00:49:21.90," no way that they were fixing to leave,"
890,00:49:21.90,00:49:23.73,and we sent them home.
891,00:49:23.73,00:49:26.60,"And he may be doing it to me,but, uh, I'll have to see it."
892,00:49:26.60,00:49:28.87, I don't believe it.
893,00:49:57.97,00:49:59.53,We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
894,00:50:00.90,00:50:03.60,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake,"
895,00:50:03.60,00:50:05.93,"our newest member, Helen,and Big Ted."
896,00:50:07.97,00:50:10.10,So let's talk about today.
897,00:50:10.10,00:50:12.00,I have to imagine it was
898,00:50:12.00,00:50:13.77,a pretty emotional dayfor you guys.
899,00:50:13.77,00:50:16.70,"-Jan?-Yes, it was very emotional."
900,00:50:16.70,00:50:19.07,And it startedreally the night before.
901,00:50:19.07,00:50:21.87,We had to make the floatsfor everyone
902,00:50:21.87,00:50:26.37,"and take them and let them goand, uh, remember who we'd met,"
903,00:50:26.37,00:50:29.93,"and, uh, it was...it was very bittersweet."
904,00:50:29.93,00:50:32.27,Any one memoryin particular stand out?
905,00:50:32.27,00:50:34.07,"Uh, of the floats?"
906,00:50:34.07,00:50:35.97,"Uh, yes."
907,00:50:35.97,00:50:38.33,"The one, uh...was most was Helen,"
908,00:50:38.33,00:50:42.97,'cause we put spoons on the topof it for her 'cause she cooked.
909,00:50:42.97,00:50:45.47,It was very emotional for me.
910,00:50:45.47,00:50:47.47,"And when I let her go, I said,"
911,00:50:47.47,00:50:49.57,"""You know, you're nota Survivor friend."
912,00:50:49.57,00:50:51.80,"You're a friend for life."""
913,00:50:51.80,00:50:54.17,"PROBST:Clay, how was it for you today?"
914,00:50:54.17,00:50:56.53,"Really, I turned each oneof them loose,"
915,00:50:56.53,00:50:58.30,and every one of themmeant something.
916,00:50:58.30,00:51:00.53,"You know, here we arefrom all-all over..."
917,00:51:00.53,00:51:03.50,"all across the United States,and, uh, we're all Americans,"
918,00:51:03.50,00:51:05.87,but yet we live so different.
919,00:51:05.87,00:51:09.00,"We had a hell of a time,you know, every one of us."
920,00:51:09.00,00:51:10.97,"-It was neat.-PROBST: Well, Brian,"
921,00:51:10.97,00:51:13.40,"for the thirdTribal Council in a row,"
922,00:51:13.40,00:51:14.87,you have immunity.
923,00:51:14.87,00:51:17.03,"Really big vote tonight,"
924,00:51:17.03,00:51:19.57,"because not only are youvoting somebody out,"
925,00:51:19.57,00:51:20.93,you're also keeping somebody.
926,00:51:20.93,00:51:23.13,"Strategically, it's huge."
927,00:51:23.13,00:51:25.40,How many times todayhave you thought
928,00:51:25.40,00:51:28.90,"about this in termsof a $900,000 decision?"
929,00:51:28.90,00:51:31.33,"Back and forth, it's likea tennis match in my head."
930,00:51:31.33,00:51:33.43,"Ping-Pong, tennis."
931,00:51:33.43,00:51:34.97,"(imitates soundof bouncing ball, chuckles)"
932,00:51:34.97,00:51:38.50,This is where you've gotto control those emotions
933,00:51:38.50,00:51:40.53,"and you've got to look,uh, tactical"
934,00:51:40.53,00:51:43.23,"as well as, uh,business decisions."
935,00:51:43.23,00:51:44.60,What's going to make sense?
936,00:51:44.60,00:51:47.03,"Uh, what's... what's fair?"
937,00:51:47.03,00:51:50.33,"So that's what I've beenkind of, uh..."
938,00:51:50.33,00:51:52.53,"uh, teeter-tottering with,as I like to say."
939,00:51:52.53,00:51:54.80,"Okay, here's how the votingwill work tonight."
940,00:51:54.80,00:51:57.13,"Jan, because you cannot votefor Brian"
941,00:51:57.13,00:51:58.50,"and you cannot votefor yourself,"
942,00:51:58.50,00:52:00.30,-you can only vote for Clay.-I know. Right.
943,00:52:00.30,00:52:02.17,"Clay, you can only vote for Jan."
944,00:52:02.17,00:52:04.07,Your two votescancel each other out.
945,00:52:04.07,00:52:05.73,-No sense in you voting.-Right.
946,00:52:05.73,00:52:08.90,"Therefore, the only person thatwill vote tonight will be Brian."
947,00:52:08.90,00:52:11.20,"You'll cast one vote,and in doing so,"
948,00:52:11.20,00:52:13.33,"you will vote outthe 14th member,"
949,00:52:13.33,00:52:16.33,"and more importantly, you willdecide who is going with you"
950,00:52:16.33,00:52:18.37,to the final Tribal Council.
951,00:52:18.37,00:52:21.93,"Having said that,it is time to vote. Brian."
952,00:52:39.70,00:52:41.63,(sighs)
953,00:52:49.47,00:52:51.27,BRIAN: You've come a long way.
954,00:52:51.27,00:52:53.23,"A long, long way."
955,00:52:53.23,00:52:54.93, Congratulations.
956,00:52:58.03,00:52:59.97,Been my pleasure.
957,00:53:15.17,00:53:17.63,I will go tally the vote.
958,00:53:37.93,00:53:40.70,"Once the vote has been read,the decision is final."
959,00:53:40.70,00:53:42.40,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
960,00:53:42.40,00:53:43.87,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
961,00:53:43.87,00:53:45.37,I'll read the vote.
962,00:53:51.47,00:53:54.90,The 14th person voted outof the tribe.
963,00:53:56.37,00:53:59.90,Jan.Need to bring me your torch.
964,00:54:08.17,00:54:10.20,"Jan, the tribe has spoken."
965,00:54:13.03,00:54:14.17,It's time for you to go.
966,00:54:17.40,00:54:18.53,I love y'all. Thanks.
967,00:54:18.53,00:54:19.70,"We love you, Jan."
968,00:54:19.70,00:54:21.37,-Good luck.-Good luck.
969,00:54:30.50,00:54:32.43,Thank you.
970,00:54:32.43,00:54:33.80,(whispers):You're welcome.
971,00:54:37.43,00:54:38.83,There's nothing left to be said.
972,00:54:38.83,00:54:42.43,You two have gone as faras you can go in this game.
973,00:54:42.43,00:54:43.87,You have one day left.
974,00:54:43.87,00:54:46.37,I will see youat the final Tribal Council.
975,00:54:46.37,00:54:47.33,Good night.
976,00:54:49.80,00:54:54.20,JAN: My experience on Survivor  has just been totally surreal.
977,00:54:54.20,00:54:56.97,I didn't knowI could ever be here 38 days
978,00:54:56.97,00:54:59.87, in a bat cave with rats and snakes.
979,00:54:59.87,00:55:01.83," If there's one thing I've learned, it's:"
980,00:55:01.83,00:55:04.70, don't listen to the word you can't do something.
981,00:55:04.70,00:55:06.50, Don't quit. I'm a teacher.
982,00:55:06.50,00:55:10.03,I don't want any of my studentsto ever quit anything.
983,00:55:28.47,00:55:30.27,"CLAY: I thought all day long,"
984,00:55:30.27,00:55:33.07,"""What would I doif I was in Brian's shoes?"""
985,00:55:34.77,00:55:36.87," You know, a million dollars is a lot of money."
986,00:55:36.87,00:55:38.63," That could make a man change his mind,"
987,00:55:38.63,00:55:40.80," but he stayed true, and, uh, when he turned it over,"
988,00:55:40.80,00:55:43.90,"it said ""Jan,"" and, uh,I was a happy man."
989,00:55:43.90,00:55:48.00,Now we got a guy in his mid-30sand a guy in his mid-40s
990,00:55:48.00,00:55:50.20,"just kicked all them youngpeople's ass, didn't we?"
991,00:55:50.20,00:55:52.70,"-Didn't we, though?-Thank you again, sir."
992,00:55:52.70,00:55:53.90,"BRIAN:Congratulations, sir."
993,00:55:53.90,00:55:55.30,"Congratulations to you, too."
994,00:55:55.30,00:55:56.77,"-We started with the preacher.-Oh, yeah."
995,00:55:56.77,00:55:58.10,"That's right.We did, didn't we?"
996,00:56:08.57,00:56:10.10,CLAY: We got a boat that's just
997,00:56:10.10,00:56:12.27," the heaviest boat I've ever saw in my life,"
998,00:56:12.27,00:56:15.43,and it has been a burden inour butt ever since we got here.
999,00:56:22.30,00:56:23.77,BRIAN: The burning of the boat
1000,00:56:23.77,00:56:25.73,was like a cleansingof the soul.
1001,00:56:25.73,00:56:27.87,It was a pain in the ass!
1002,00:56:27.87,00:56:30.47,"BRIAN: I wanted to get rid of any sort of, uh..."
1003,00:56:30.47,00:56:33.70,uh... bad energy.
1004,00:56:33.70,00:56:36.03,"-CLAY: Bye, boat. No more water.-BRIAN: Bye, boat."
1005,00:56:36.03,00:56:37.90,No more problems.
1006,00:56:37.90,00:56:40.57,"(Clay yelling, Brian whooping)"
1007,00:56:40.57,00:56:42.20,"All right, we did it, daddy."
1008,00:56:42.20,00:56:44.70,-Congratulations.-Congratulations. Thank you.
1009,00:56:44.70,00:56:46.63,CLAY: We're finished... we're finished with the water runs.
1010,00:56:46.63,00:56:48.60,We're finished paddling places.
1011,00:56:48.60,00:56:50.23,We're...we're finished gathering
1012,00:56:50.23,00:56:51.57, clams and crabs.
1013,00:56:51.57,00:56:54.80," It was, uh, nice to see it go."
1014,00:56:54.80,00:56:56.07,Wow. It's over.
1015,00:56:58.40,00:57:00.33,It's actually over.
1016,00:57:25.30,00:57:27.93,Knew that sun would come.Look at it peeking its ass up
1017,00:57:27.93,00:57:29.60,"-up on top of that deal. -Oh,yeah. Look at that thing. Wow."
1018,00:57:29.60,00:57:31.70,Look at that big old sun.
1019,00:57:37.33,00:57:38.63,"CLAY:39, baby."
1020,00:57:38.63,00:57:40.33,-Ooh!-Whoo!
1021,00:57:40.33,00:57:42.17,Last day.
1022,00:57:43.60,00:57:45.33,"Uh-huh. Oh, yeah."
1023,00:57:45.33,00:57:47.37,Wow.
1024,00:57:47.37,00:57:49.67,What a beautiful sight.
1025,00:57:49.67,00:57:52.00,The last coconut.
1026,00:57:52.00,00:57:54.30,"You know what? It doesn't havedirt all over it, either."
1027,00:57:54.30,00:57:55.70,-Look at that.-Mm-hmm.
1028,00:57:55.70,00:57:58.83,CLAY: Day 39 is the most memorable time of my life.
1029,00:57:58.83,00:58:02.37,I would not changeanything I've done...
1030,00:58:02.37,00:58:06.50, any experience I've had in the last 39 days.
1031,00:58:06.50,00:58:07.87,My gosh.
1032,00:58:07.87,00:58:09.27,BRIAN: We're literally down to hours now.
1033,00:58:09.27,00:58:11.40, This isn't days. This isn't weeks.
1034,00:58:11.40,00:58:13.17, We are down to hours.
1035,00:58:13.17,00:58:14.67,Okay.
1036,00:58:14.67,00:58:16.23,"Excellent job, sir."
1037,00:58:16.23,00:58:17.50,Thank you.
1038,00:58:18.80,00:58:20.33,"Good job to you, too."
1039,00:58:20.33,00:58:21.67,Appreciate that.
1040,00:58:41.27,00:58:44.10,"CLAY: If you look at the whole game, each one of us"
1041,00:58:44.10,00:58:47.70, had to do something for the other one to survive.
1042,00:58:47.70,00:58:50.80," So somewhere in there, all 16 people"
1043,00:58:50.80,00:58:53.90, ended up having to help the other one live on this island.
1044,00:58:53.90,00:58:55.37,"We suffered a hell of a lot,"
1045,00:58:55.37,00:58:57.37,"but when you're lookingback on it,"
1046,00:58:57.37,00:58:59.83,"wow, what a memorable event."
1047,00:58:59.83,00:59:01.40,"That's it, Clay."
1048,00:59:01.40,00:59:03.77,-We're out of here.-We are out of here.
1049,00:59:05.63,00:59:07.03,BRIAN: We both had fun.
1050,00:59:07.03,00:59:09.23, We both brought meaning into this.
1051,00:59:09.23,00:59:11.50," We're now sitting in the, uh, winner's circle."
1052,00:59:11.50,00:59:13.37," You can't get any higher in this game,"
1053,00:59:13.37,00:59:15.93,and it's now up to a juryto decide our fate.
1054,00:59:23.37,00:59:25.90," Yeah, this is strictly a game to me."
1055,00:59:25.90,00:59:27.77, It's about building relationships
1056,00:59:27.77,00:59:30.00, and cutting your losses
1057,00:59:30.00,00:59:33.67," to move onto the next level, to get to a certain position."
1058,00:59:33.67,00:59:35.23,But the relationshipsthat you built
1059,00:59:35.23,00:59:37.00,weren't necessarily real.
1060,00:59:40.27,00:59:41.77, That's a sad fact of reality--
1061,00:59:41.77,00:59:44.73, that this game is a little brutal.
1062,00:59:44.73,00:59:46.37,This game is dangerous.
1063,00:59:46.37,00:59:48.83,"If you don't have strong skin,you're going to be done quick."
1064,00:59:52.00,00:59:53.60,"Just over the last couple days,"
1065,00:59:53.60,00:59:55.73," things have gotten pretty, uh, touch and go,"
1066,00:59:55.73,00:59:57.63, and there might have been some opinions formed
1067,00:59:57.63,00:59:59.63, in how cutthroat I am.
1068,00:59:59.63,01:00:01.53,It's a little scaryto be sitting up there
1069,01:00:01.53,01:00:03.53,"with the spotlight on you,interrogated."
1070,01:00:10.93,01:00:12.67,CLAY: Everybody respects Brian.
1071,01:00:12.67,01:00:13.93, He's a class act.
1072,01:00:13.93,01:00:15.93," But, uh, Ted and Helen felt like they had"
1073,01:00:15.93,01:00:18.23," a pretty solid base with old Brian,"
1074,01:00:18.23,01:00:21.70," and, uh, they may feel more betrayed by him than me."
1075,01:00:26.50,01:00:28.97, I'm sure all 16 of us come out there
1076,01:00:28.97,01:00:31.73, definitely not wanting to be the first one kicked off.
1077,01:00:31.73,01:00:33.63,"Well, somebody had to bethe first one kicked off,"
1078,01:00:33.63,01:00:35.33,and somebody's got to winthe million.
1079,01:00:35.33,01:00:37.17, It's just all the stuff in between these two people
1080,01:00:37.17,01:00:38.80, that i-is the problem.
1081,01:00:38.80,01:00:40.17, I wish all of us here
1082,01:00:40.17,01:00:42.17," could get a million dollars, but we can't."
1083,01:00:42.17,01:00:44.40, It ends up with one person-- one lone Survivor--
1084,01:00:44.40,01:00:47.23,"and, uh, I still gotone more to beat."
1085,01:01:17.30,01:01:20.80,We'll now bring inour full jury of seven members.
1086,01:01:22.80,01:01:28.53,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake, Helen,"
1087,01:01:28.53,01:01:31.80,"Ted and our newest member, Jan."
1088,01:01:38.67,01:01:40.80,Welcome to your finalTribal Council.
1089,01:01:40.80,01:01:43.00,Let me startby saying congratulations.
1090,01:01:43.00,01:01:44.23,Thank you.
1091,01:01:44.23,01:01:45.57,It's a little bitdifferent tonight.
1092,01:01:45.57,01:01:47.33,"In the past,the power of the vote"
1093,01:01:47.33,01:01:50.40,resided on this sideof the flame.
1094,01:01:50.40,01:01:52.40,"Tonight, that shifts"
1095,01:01:52.40,01:01:54.53,"to the other side of the fire,to our jury."
1096,01:01:54.53,01:01:56.77,Seven people that eitherdirectly or indirectly
1097,01:01:56.77,01:01:59.87,you had a hand in votingout of this game
1098,01:01:59.87,01:02:03.17,now have your fate entirelyin their hands.
1099,01:02:03.17,01:02:05.73,"Tonight, they'll be votingfor a sole Survivor."
1100,01:02:05.73,01:02:08.83,"We'll begin with openingstatements by the two of you,"
1101,01:02:08.83,01:02:10.83,why you deserveto win this game.
1102,01:02:10.83,01:02:13.53,The jury will then get a chanceto address
1103,01:02:13.53,01:02:16.07,each of you individuallyand ask you a question.
1104,01:02:16.07,01:02:17.63,They're looking for information
1105,01:02:17.63,01:02:19.37,to help them makea big decision.
1106,01:02:19.37,01:02:20.87,And then we vote.
1107,01:02:20.87,01:02:23.80,Let's start with ouropening statements. Clay.
1108,01:02:23.80,01:02:28.50,"Wow. What do I say besides, uh,I'm a lucky guy?"
1109,01:02:28.50,01:02:31.73,"I'm, uh, sitting here,and I'm not sitting over there."
1110,01:02:31.73,01:02:33.60,"The-the-the hard partof this game is,"
1111,01:02:33.60,01:02:36.37,"uh, we're people--we're not pieces of a puzzle--"
1112,01:02:36.37,01:02:38.10,"and, uh, somewhere in there,"
1113,01:02:38.10,01:02:41.17,I had to tell some untruthsand put y'all over there.
1114,01:02:41.17,01:02:44.17,"And I can promise you this, uh,"
1115,01:02:44.17,01:02:46.37,"if y'all could replacemy seat here,"
1116,01:02:46.37,01:02:48.30,y'all would doexactly like I did.
1117,01:02:48.30,01:02:51.60,"Everybody came to playthe hardest they can,"
1118,01:02:51.60,01:02:53.37,"and I did, too,and I'm sitting over here."
1119,01:02:53.37,01:02:56.97,"Th-this is a hard, uh...uh, thing to say."
1120,01:02:56.97,01:02:58.60,"Yes, I want the million."
1121,01:02:58.60,01:03:01.83,Million dollars at age 46would mean...
1122,01:03:01.83,01:03:04.23,"definitely a life-changing,uh, deal, you know."
1123,01:03:04.23,01:03:06.60,"Everybody goesthrough bad luck, and, uh,"
1124,01:03:06.60,01:03:08.63,"unfortunately,I'm just coming out of some..."
1125,01:03:08.63,01:03:11.80,"a little bad luck and, uh,starting on my road up again."
1126,01:03:11.80,01:03:14.47,"And what a jump, what a boostthat would give me."
1127,01:03:14.47,01:03:16.67,"It's up to y'all, and, uh,"
1128,01:03:16.67,01:03:18.53,"I know it'sa super hard decision,"
1129,01:03:18.53,01:03:20.53,"because regardlessof what y'all make,"
1130,01:03:20.53,01:03:23.53,y'all had to livewith both of us for a while.
1131,01:03:23.53,01:03:25.30,Good luck.
1132,01:03:25.30,01:03:27.97,Brian.
1133,01:03:27.97,01:03:30.87,"Well, uh, first of all, I justwant to say it's been"
1134,01:03:30.87,01:03:32.60,"a pleasure, uh, knowing eachand every one of you"
1135,01:03:32.60,01:03:36.53,"through these, uh, days thatwe've had to know each other."
1136,01:03:36.53,01:03:38.97,"Uh, we've all hadpositive experiences,"
1137,01:03:38.97,01:03:41.27,and we've all hadsome bad experiences.
1138,01:03:41.27,01:03:43.10,And I think that there's been
1139,01:03:43.10,01:03:46.90,"some form of leadershipthrough example,"
1140,01:03:46.90,01:03:48.70,leadership through merits.
1141,01:03:48.70,01:03:50.93,There's been no complaintson my part.
1142,01:03:50.93,01:03:54.17,"There's been no storiesfabricated for, uh, sympathy."
1143,01:03:54.17,01:03:56.97,"There's been just a positiveoutlook, I think, every day"
1144,01:03:56.97,01:03:58.53,on a... on a daily basis.
1145,01:03:58.53,01:04:00.37,"But, uh, you know my focus--"
1146,01:04:00.37,01:04:02.03,"my focus was making sureeverything was okay,"
1147,01:04:02.03,01:04:05.17,"uh, making sure we all had, uh,food in our bellies,"
1148,01:04:05.17,01:04:06.70,making sure we were all warmat night.
1149,01:04:06.70,01:04:09.80,"Um, along the way, uh, youdevelop some friends, but this"
1150,01:04:09.80,01:04:12.10,"is a game, and there werecertain people that had to go,"
1151,01:04:12.10,01:04:13.90,"uh, before others,and that's what sucked."
1152,01:04:13.90,01:04:15.97,"Uh, but I dealt with itthe best way I could,"
1153,01:04:15.97,01:04:17.57,sometimes by notsaying anything.
1154,01:04:17.57,01:04:20.70,"So, uh, votefrom your hearts, and, um,"
1155,01:04:20.70,01:04:23.10,look at the whole time thatwe've either known each other
1156,01:04:23.10,01:04:24.60,"and, uh...and feel good about it."
1157,01:04:24.60,01:04:26.40,"That's all I'm asking for,is you guys feel good"
1158,01:04:26.40,01:04:27.83,"about whateveryou're going to do, and, uh..."
1159,01:04:27.83,01:04:30.20,"uh, I respect every one of youin your own way,"
1160,01:04:30.20,01:04:32.93,"and it's been, uh... a pleasureknowing you all."
1161,01:04:32.93,01:04:35.00,I appreciate it.Thank you.
1162,01:04:35.00,01:04:40.33,"Okay, jury, had a chance to hearwhat Clay and Brian had to say."
1163,01:04:40.33,01:04:43.33,"In a moment, you're going to geta chance to ask them a question"
1164,01:04:43.33,01:04:45.10,that will give youinformation you need
1165,01:04:45.10,01:04:48.37,to decide who will bethe sole Survivor.
1166,01:04:48.37,01:04:50.07,I'll give you a momentto think about that.
1167,01:05:10.13,01:05:11.13,"PROBST:Okay, jury."
1168,01:05:11.13,01:05:13.73,Had a chance to hearwhat Clay and Brian had to say.
1169,01:05:13.73,01:05:15.83,It's now your chanceto address them.
1170,01:05:15.83,01:05:19.43,This is your opportunityto ask a question from them
1171,01:05:19.43,01:05:20.93,to give youthe information you need
1172,01:05:20.93,01:05:22.37,to make a very big decision.
1173,01:05:22.37,01:05:24.30,"Erin, we'll start with you."
1174,01:05:26.23,01:05:28.37,"-Hi, guys.-Hello. -(whispers): Hi."
1175,01:05:28.37,01:05:30.33,"Um, I've sat and listened"
1176,01:05:30.33,01:05:32.20,through every singleTribal Council.
1177,01:05:32.20,01:05:35.40,"Now, we've already heardwhy you think you deserve"
1178,01:05:35.40,01:05:36.80,the million dollars.
1179,01:05:36.80,01:05:38.43,Now I want to know
1180,01:05:38.43,01:05:41.67,why each of you thinkthe person sitting next to you
1181,01:05:41.67,01:05:44.27,does not deservethe million dollars.
1182,01:05:44.27,01:05:45.73,I think we'll start with Brian.
1183,01:05:45.73,01:05:49.63,I think Claydoes not deserve the million
1184,01:05:49.63,01:05:52.23,"because over a periodof, say, 39 days"
1185,01:05:52.23,01:05:55.60,he did not put forththe effort that he could have.
1186,01:05:55.60,01:05:58.07,There's a lot more spunkin this little man
1187,01:05:58.07,01:05:59.80,"than I think we've seen,"
1188,01:05:59.80,01:06:04.00,"and, uh, I think he coastedthrough a few, uh, scenarios."
1189,01:06:04.00,01:06:05.23,He was more of a thinker
1190,01:06:05.23,01:06:07.23,whereas I was more of a...of a doer.
1191,01:06:07.23,01:06:09.00,Clay?
1192,01:06:09.00,01:06:10.43,"Uh, he, uh...he thought he was the leader"
1193,01:06:10.43,01:06:11.97,"of the camp, and, uh,"
1194,01:06:11.97,01:06:14.63,"there was times that he thoughteverybody should come to him,"
1195,01:06:14.63,01:06:16.90,"and, uh, they didn't alwayshave to come talk to Brian."
1196,01:06:16.90,01:06:18.80,"You know, there's othertribe members they could go"
1197,01:06:18.80,01:06:21.67,"discuss, uh, things withwithout, uh,"
1198,01:06:21.67,01:06:23.20,him getting defensiveor trying to worry
1199,01:06:23.20,01:06:25.07,about what they'retalking about.
1200,01:06:25.07,01:06:27.17,"If, uh, he hadso much power in camp,"
1201,01:06:27.17,01:06:29.33,"uh, he wouldn't have hadto worry about that."
1202,01:06:29.33,01:06:30.77,-Okay.-PROBST: Satisfied?
1203,01:06:30.77,01:06:31.97,Satisfied.
1204,01:06:31.97,01:06:33.77,"Thanks, Erin."
1205,01:06:33.77,01:06:34.87,Ken.
1206,01:06:34.87,01:06:36.70,"-Hey. How you guys doing?-CLAY: Hey, guy."
1207,01:06:36.70,01:06:38.80,"-Okay.-Clay, you said that, um,"
1208,01:06:38.80,01:06:40.67,"there's not a person over herethat would, uh..."
1209,01:06:40.67,01:06:43.20,that wouldn't do what you didto change places.
1210,01:06:43.20,01:06:45.57,"Well, you're wrong.I wouldn't do it, okay?"
1211,01:06:45.57,01:06:47.60,"I was straightforwardto everybody,"
1212,01:06:47.60,01:06:50.17,"I never lied,and I kept my integrity."
1213,01:06:50.17,01:06:51.40,"Okay, that'swhat I go home with,"
1214,01:06:51.40,01:06:52.70,'cause that'sthe only thing a man
1215,01:06:52.70,01:06:54.20,can go home withat the end of the night
1216,01:06:54.20,01:06:55.20,after everything's gone.
1217,01:06:55.20,01:06:56.47,Okay.
1218,01:06:56.47,01:06:59.23,"Brian, when we first arrivedat Chuay Gahn,"
1219,01:06:59.23,01:07:01.57,"you told me that Ted had to go,"
1220,01:07:01.57,01:07:04.33,"that he'd never make itto the final two,"
1221,01:07:04.33,01:07:06.63,and there's a reason he wouldn'tmake it to the final two.
1222,01:07:06.63,01:07:09.93,So why don't you tell the jurywhy Ted had to go?
1223,01:07:09.93,01:07:13.27,I didn't ever mentionTed had to go.
1224,01:07:13.27,01:07:14.67,"KEN: Okay, le-let's...let's rewind again."
1225,01:07:14.67,01:07:17.60,"Remember, I know the answerto this-- you told me this--"
1226,01:07:17.60,01:07:20.13,so just tell the jurywhat you told me.
1227,01:07:20.13,01:07:22.07,Why was...why did Ted have to go?
1228,01:07:22.07,01:07:23.43,That's all I want to know.
1229,01:07:23.43,01:07:26.27,"Uh, Ted had to go because he hada problem, uh, uh,"
1230,01:07:26.27,01:07:27.40,forming together with a group.
1231,01:07:27.40,01:07:28.83,So there was a feeling of Ted
1232,01:07:28.83,01:07:30.93,"kind of breaking off,doing his own thing."
1233,01:07:30.93,01:07:33.23,"So that was the reason,I think--"
1234,01:07:33.23,01:07:35.33,"the lack of, uh...uh, gelling with the group."
1235,01:07:35.33,01:07:36.67,-Okay.-Simple as that.
1236,01:07:36.67,01:07:37.77,-I-I'm...-PROBST: Ken.
1237,01:07:37.77,01:07:39.07,"Ken, I just wantto make sure I'm clear."
1238,01:07:39.07,01:07:40.50,Brian told you something.
1239,01:07:40.50,01:07:42.70,"KEN: Well, Brian just told metwo different things,"
1240,01:07:42.70,01:07:44.60,which neither one of themare what he told me
1241,01:07:44.60,01:07:46.50,"when this was originallydone here,"
1242,01:07:46.50,01:07:47.87,when we originally talkedabout it.
1243,01:07:47.87,01:07:49.20,There's no big deal here.I'm satisfied.
1244,01:07:49.20,01:07:50.73,-I'm not going to push himanymore. -PROBST: Okay.
1245,01:07:50.73,01:07:52.07,Did you get the honesty?
1246,01:07:52.07,01:07:53.67,"-No, I did not.-Okay."
1247,01:07:53.67,01:07:55.80,"-And you're satisfied?-I'm satisfied. I mean, that's"
1248,01:07:55.80,01:07:57.83,between him and... him and God.
1249,01:07:59.30,01:08:00.57,Penny.
1250,01:08:05.40,01:08:07.03,"When we cameinto this merger, um,"
1251,01:08:07.03,01:08:08.40,we obviously didn'thave the numbers.
1252,01:08:08.40,01:08:11.50,"We were down,you know, five to three."
1253,01:08:11.50,01:08:13.30,But knowingthat I was just a number
1254,01:08:13.30,01:08:16.10,"and I was eventually going to bevoted off based on that,"
1255,01:08:16.10,01:08:19.50,I still took the timeto get to know both of you.
1256,01:08:19.50,01:08:22.43,But did you really botherto get to know who I am?
1257,01:08:22.43,01:08:25.03,"-Okay.-Uh, for example, Brian,"
1258,01:08:25.03,01:08:26.57,do you know where I grew up?
1259,01:08:28.30,01:08:30.67,In Texas.
1260,01:08:30.67,01:08:32.10,-Do you know where in Texas?-Um...
1261,01:08:32.10,01:08:35.13,"I want to say, uh, Beaumont."
1262,01:08:35.13,01:08:36.77,"Somewhere in Beaumont, Texas."
1263,01:08:36.77,01:08:38.33,That would be Jan.
1264,01:08:38.33,01:08:39.57,Do I have any siblings?
1265,01:08:39.57,01:08:41.53,"And if I do,what are their names?"
1266,01:08:41.53,01:08:45.83,You've got... an older brother.
1267,01:08:45.83,01:08:47.83,Or an older sister.
1268,01:08:47.83,01:08:49.47,"No, I'm the oldest."
1269,01:08:49.47,01:08:51.03,You're the oldest. Okay.
1270,01:08:51.03,01:08:53.17,And I don't know their names.
1271,01:08:53.17,01:08:54.97,"Is there anythingyou want to add, Clay?"
1272,01:08:54.97,01:08:58.43,"Well, I know you are a huge,uh, Texas Tech Red Raider fan,"
1273,01:08:58.43,01:09:00.37,"and, uh, I'm real impressedthat, uh, Colleen,"
1274,01:09:00.37,01:09:02.77,"your-your future sister-in-law,is planning your wedding."
1275,01:09:02.77,01:09:05.87,"When you was in high school,you made a huge decision,"
1276,01:09:05.87,01:09:07.80,"and, uh, you were livingwith your daddy"
1277,01:09:07.80,01:09:09.60,and went to livingwith your mother.
1278,01:09:09.60,01:09:11.57,You didn't get to spendall your childhood
1279,01:09:11.57,01:09:14.90,"with your sister, and, uh,you really do regret that,"
1280,01:09:14.90,01:09:17.03,"but y'all have got a...a real good relationship,"
1281,01:09:17.03,01:09:18.77,"uh, going now.I don't know what else"
1282,01:09:18.77,01:09:20.53,-to tell you. That... All right.-That's fine.
1283,01:09:20.53,01:09:21.57,I'm satisfied.
1284,01:09:21.57,01:09:22.60,-Thank you.-Thanks. Uh-huh.
1285,01:09:22.60,01:09:23.67,"-Good luck.-Thanks, Penny."
1286,01:09:23.67,01:09:24.87,Thank you.
1287,01:09:24.87,01:09:25.97,Jake.
1288,01:09:28.40,01:09:29.77,"Hi, guys."
1289,01:09:29.77,01:09:31.03,-Hey.-You're kind of in
1290,01:09:31.03,01:09:32.03,"the hot seat tonight,aren't you?"
1291,01:09:32.03,01:09:33.33,"Oh, I'm telling you."
1292,01:09:33.33,01:09:36.07,"I'm kind of glad, in a way,that I'm over"
1293,01:09:36.07,01:09:38.83,on this side of this fireand not on that side.
1294,01:09:38.83,01:09:42.20,"I also want to tell you thatI don't know how you did it,"
1295,01:09:42.20,01:09:44.47,"but, boy, did y'all doa number on me"
1296,01:09:44.47,01:09:49.37,by taking a personwho I had a strong alliance with
1297,01:09:49.37,01:09:52.50,"and getting her to voteagainst me, and that was Penny."
1298,01:09:52.50,01:09:53.93,Which I thought was just
1299,01:09:53.93,01:09:56.63,"a really clever,manipulative move."
1300,01:09:56.63,01:10:00.23,"Now, on that very night,Jeff asked,"
1301,01:10:00.23,01:10:03.00,"""Does anybody feel like theymight get voted out?"""
1302,01:10:03.00,01:10:05.10,"And I said, ""Yeah, I-I feelpretty vulnerable tonight."
1303,01:10:05.10,01:10:08.83,"""I'm just excited the factthat Brian stated"
1304,01:10:08.83,01:10:12.00,"""that the vote is going to beon performance,"
1305,01:10:12.00,01:10:14.37,"""because let me tell you,"
1306,01:10:14.37,01:10:18.80,"""I do know that I performas good as anybody out there"
1307,01:10:18.80,01:10:20.57,"and probably better than most."""
1308,01:10:20.57,01:10:23.47,"Now, we had just gottenback to camp, and, Clay,"
1309,01:10:23.47,01:10:28.97,you really blasted meabout the fact that I'm next.
1310,01:10:28.97,01:10:31.20,My question is this.
1311,01:10:31.20,01:10:33.83,"Why did you feel threatenedfor what I had said,"
1312,01:10:33.83,01:10:36.70,which was only the samerepeated what Brian said?
1313,01:10:36.70,01:10:38.13,CLAY:The reason that it upset me--
1314,01:10:38.13,01:10:42.10,"because when you come to camp,within, uh, 15 minutes,"
1315,01:10:42.10,01:10:44.20,you started tryingto make an alliance with me.
1316,01:10:44.20,01:10:46.43,Then you're trying to makean alliance to Ted.
1317,01:10:46.43,01:10:48.07,"Then come out,you're talking to Brian,"
1318,01:10:48.07,01:10:49.93,trying to make another onewith him.
1319,01:10:49.93,01:10:53.20,"You was trying to play me withall of my own tribe members,"
1320,01:10:53.20,01:10:55.33,and you didn't thinkwe wasn't going to talk?
1321,01:10:55.33,01:10:56.93,You were wrong.
1322,01:10:56.93,01:10:58.60,All right.
1323,01:10:58.60,01:11:01.53,"Now, Brian, how did you feelat that point?"
1324,01:11:01.53,01:11:04.77,I was working hand in handwith you.
1325,01:11:04.77,01:11:07.20,"You were out there clammingwith me, getting food."
1326,01:11:07.20,01:11:09.60,"No, at the time,I did not feel the same way,"
1327,01:11:09.60,01:11:10.77,to answer your question.
1328,01:11:12.10,01:11:14.07,-Satisfied?-Satisfied.
1329,01:11:14.07,01:11:15.63,"Thanks, Jake."
1330,01:11:15.63,01:11:16.67,Ted.
1331,01:11:18.87,01:11:20.47,"First to you, Brian."
1332,01:11:20.47,01:11:22.87,"Brian, um, you know,the way you played this game,"
1333,01:11:22.87,01:11:25.90,"you truly are a great,great car salesman."
1334,01:11:25.90,01:11:27.90,You sold me your friendship.
1335,01:11:27.90,01:11:31.40,You sold me your understandingof... of cultural diversity.
1336,01:11:31.40,01:11:33.40,"And most of all,you sold me your word,"
1337,01:11:33.40,01:11:36.67,all to find out that each oneof those qualities were lemons.
1338,01:11:36.67,01:11:40.97,"Clay, you, on the other hand...I mean, you sit there"
1339,01:11:40.97,01:11:43.60,only because you rodethe coattail of Brian.
1340,01:11:43.60,01:11:47.23,"I really, really,really did overestimate you."
1341,01:11:47.23,01:11:48.97,You're nothing morethan an ignorant
1342,01:11:48.97,01:11:51.73,Southern redneck hillbilly.
1343,01:11:51.73,01:11:53.23,That's fine.
1344,01:11:53.23,01:11:54.70,"My question to you is,"
1345,01:11:54.70,01:11:57.53,how do you definea racist person?
1346,01:11:57.53,01:12:01.87,I don't know of a racist remarkI-I-I said.
1347,01:12:01.87,01:12:05.07,"So you're basically telling me,behind my back,"
1348,01:12:05.07,01:12:08.97,you've never madeany racist comments?
1349,01:12:08.97,01:12:11.30,-About you? No.-About me.
1350,01:12:11.30,01:12:13.50,"I-I didn't.If I did, I sure didn't mean to."
1351,01:12:13.50,01:12:15.40,TED:Okay. So...
1352,01:12:15.40,01:12:19.57,what is Clay's definitionof a racist person?
1353,01:12:19.57,01:12:21.00,"-I think... Okay.-""Well, my definition"
1354,01:12:21.00,01:12:22.17,"-of a racist person is... this.""-I think that..."
1355,01:12:22.17,01:12:23.50,"Ted, I think a racist person"
1356,01:12:23.50,01:12:25.97,"that tries to belittlethe other race,"
1357,01:12:25.97,01:12:28.47,"whether it's white, black,brown, pink or purple, whatever."
1358,01:12:28.47,01:12:29.97,TED:Okay.
1359,01:12:29.97,01:12:33.23,Part two of this question:What can you say to convince me

1361,01:12:35.57,01:12:37.57,"I was, uh, fair with Ted."
1362,01:12:38.67,01:12:39.87,You were fair with me?
1363,01:12:39.87,01:12:40.97,Yeah.

1379,01:13:14.60,01:13:18.37,"in the total workof the water and the food,"
1380,01:13:18.37,01:13:21.50,and making the tribe liveand survive on day-to-day.
1381,01:13:21.50,01:13:24.77,"As far as getting food, yes,I-I-I very well did my share."
1382,01:13:24.77,01:13:26.27,"As far as swimmingand getting the water,"
1383,01:13:26.27,01:13:29.07,he did swim a whole lot morethan I did to go get the water.
1384,01:13:29.07,01:13:31.00,"And, uh, I asked him, I said,""Brian, I'll go."""
1385,01:13:31.00,01:13:33.63,"He said, ""No, you...you got other things."" And, uh,"
1386,01:13:33.63,01:13:37.03,"I said, ""If you... when you-youwant me to go, I'm ready to go."""
1387,01:13:37.03,01:13:38.67,"And he said,""No, I got it,"" and, uh,"
1388,01:13:38.67,01:13:40.80,-so I stayed at the house.-Okay.
1389,01:13:40.80,01:13:43.03,"Now, Brian, will you defend, uh,"
1390,01:13:43.03,01:13:46.97,"your comparison of the workloadas compared to Clay, please?"
1391,01:13:46.97,01:13:49.07,"On a daily basis, I would clam."
1392,01:13:49.07,01:13:52.37,"Every two to three days,I would get water."
1393,01:13:52.37,01:13:54.83,"Uh, every night, I wouldmake sure the fire was, uh..."
1394,01:13:54.83,01:13:57.03,"uh, keeping us all warm,"
1395,01:13:57.03,01:14:00.63,"as well as, uh, tendingto the wonderful soup"
1396,01:14:00.63,01:14:04.37,"that, uh... uh, allowed usto survive for so many days."
1397,01:14:04.37,01:14:05.60,"I knew what had to be done,"
1398,01:14:05.60,01:14:07.03,and I was more than willingand able.
1399,01:14:07.03,01:14:10.40,Okay. Thank you.They... I'm satisfied.
1400,01:14:12.13,01:14:13.23,Helen.
1401,01:14:16.70,01:14:20.20,"Well, we spent 37 days together."
1402,01:14:21.83,01:14:23.70,And I had my mind made upweek two
1403,01:14:23.70,01:14:26.00,"who I was going to vote for,but that got ripped"
1404,01:14:26.00,01:14:29.33,right out of my mindthe night I left here.
1405,01:14:29.33,01:14:31.77,"I asked you, Brian, point-blank"
1406,01:14:31.77,01:14:35.17,"if I was going, because youand I had that thing going."
1407,01:14:35.17,01:14:38.10,"We had that trust,that we'd give the other person"
1408,01:14:38.10,01:14:40.03,the courtesy of telling them.
1409,01:14:40.03,01:14:42.07,But you and Claytold me Jan was going.
1410,01:14:42.07,01:14:44.47,And Jan appearedto me really upset that day.
1411,01:14:44.47,01:14:47.73,"And I went to both of you,and I said, ""You know what?"
1412,01:14:47.73,01:14:49.50,"I think she deservesto know she's going."""
1413,01:14:49.50,01:14:52.20,"And you both looked right at meand said, ""No."
1414,01:14:52.20,01:14:54.43,"""Leave her alone.She knows she's going."
1415,01:14:54.43,01:14:56.90,"Why make her miserable?""Knowing full well"
1416,01:14:56.90,01:14:59.20,that you had turned the tableson me.
1417,01:14:59.20,01:15:03.10,You promised me it was us threegoing to the threesome.
1418,01:15:03.10,01:15:06.63,But neither one of youwere man enough to tell me.
1419,01:15:06.63,01:15:08.30,"Clay, it doesn't surprise mefrom you."
1420,01:15:08.30,01:15:10.50,You lived up to exactlywhat I thought you were
1421,01:15:10.50,01:15:12.43,the whole time out there.
1422,01:15:12.43,01:15:16.07,"But, Brian, felt like I wasliving the Julius Caesar play."
1423,01:15:16.07,01:15:20.17,"I wanted to turn aroundand say, ""Et tu, Brute?"""
1424,01:15:20.17,01:15:24.13,"You are the epitomeof the trashy used-car salesman,"
1425,01:15:24.13,01:15:27.97,and I have to tell youit really hurt.
1426,01:15:27.97,01:15:31.53,"You duped me,you made a fool of me,"
1427,01:15:31.53,01:15:36.13,"you strung me along, and youlet me sit here and get stunned."
1428,01:15:36.13,01:15:39.13,So now is your opportunityto tell me
1429,01:15:39.13,01:15:41.53,why you didn't give me the...
1430,01:15:41.53,01:15:45.60,"the decency, after allthat time, to tell me,"
1431,01:15:45.60,01:15:48.40,and then follow upwith why I should vote for you.
1432,01:15:48.40,01:15:50.23,Sure.
1433,01:15:50.23,01:15:53.77,"When... about two days prior,"
1434,01:15:53.77,01:15:57.37,"when, uh, you and Tedthought Jan was sleeping,"
1435,01:15:57.37,01:16:00.43,there was a pecking orderthat you were scheming with Ted
1436,01:16:00.43,01:16:02.87,that was told to me through Jan.
1437,01:16:02.87,01:16:04.30,"It was, uh, written in the sand."
1438,01:16:04.30,01:16:06.73,"I was extremely surprised,coming from you."
1439,01:16:06.73,01:16:10.60,I felt just as betrayedas you did at the time.
1440,01:16:10.60,01:16:12.20,I felt hurt.
1441,01:16:12.20,01:16:14.80,"I felt, uh,we did have a relationship."
1442,01:16:14.80,01:16:16.13,We had a friendship.
1443,01:16:16.13,01:16:17.73,I felt you misused the trust.
1444,01:16:17.73,01:16:20.37,You scheme up a planto go against me...
1445,01:16:20.37,01:16:24.33,"And I told you, Brian,that if I ever changed my mind"
1446,01:16:24.33,01:16:25.87,that I would tell you first.
1447,01:16:25.87,01:16:28.00,I never came to youto tell you that
1448,01:16:28.00,01:16:30.20,because I never changed my mind.
1449,01:16:30.20,01:16:32.83,Your name was neveron my ballot.
1450,01:16:32.83,01:16:34.83,I'm asking youyour specific reason
1451,01:16:34.83,01:16:38.47,for not telling me that nightas we were walking out.
1452,01:16:38.47,01:16:41.73,Because of the knifethat you put in my back
1453,01:16:41.73,01:16:44.30,"through the, uh...what Jan told me."
1454,01:16:44.30,01:16:47.37,Hearsay? Hearsay? Somethingthat didn't come from me?
1455,01:16:47.37,01:16:48.93,"-She saw it. She heard it,Hel... -Something that you"
1456,01:16:48.93,01:16:50.87,"didn't ask me about,this is what you're going on?"
1457,01:16:50.87,01:16:52.27,-You played a game with...-This is what
1458,01:16:52.27,01:16:53.83,you're going on?This is what you're going on?
1459,01:16:53.83,01:16:55.07,-Hearsay? Mm-hmm.-Yes. Yes.
1460,01:16:55.07,01:16:56.37,You didn't come to meand ask me?
1461,01:16:56.37,01:16:58.63,"I was hurt,just like you were hurt."
1462,01:16:58.63,01:17:02.40,"I misled you, and I admit it."
1463,01:17:02.40,01:17:05.63,-I couldn't tell youthat I felt betrayed. -Why?
1464,01:17:05.63,01:17:06.90,This is what I'm going for--why?
1465,01:17:06.90,01:17:08.97,Because I felt you weretrying to take me out next.
1466,01:17:08.97,01:17:13.00,I'm just asking why you didn'tthink I deserved the decency
1467,01:17:13.00,01:17:14.33,"of a, ""Yes, H, you're going."""
1468,01:17:14.33,01:17:16.07,You could've done itas we were walking out the door.
1469,01:17:16.07,01:17:17.33,Code of silence after that--
1470,01:17:17.33,01:17:19.00,you would've never hadto deal with me again.
1471,01:17:19.00,01:17:20.83,"I was very angry at youscheming against me, so..."
1472,01:17:20.83,01:17:22.20,"Again, hearsay."
1473,01:17:22.20,01:17:23.87,"PROBST: Helen, let him...give him a chance to answer."
1474,01:17:23.87,01:17:25.67,"-All right.-BRIAN: I was very angry at you,"
1475,01:17:25.67,01:17:27.53,and I wanted you to hear it
1476,01:17:27.53,01:17:29.67,and feel it that nightat the jury.
1477,01:17:29.67,01:17:32.53,That I was pissed at youfor going behind my back
1478,01:17:32.53,01:17:34.37,"after the relationshipthat we did have,"
1479,01:17:34.37,01:17:36.83,"that I thought I could trust youas well,"
1480,01:17:36.83,01:17:38.00,and you did this to me.
1481,01:17:38.00,01:17:39.40,You put together a planwith Ted.
1482,01:17:39.40,01:17:42.10,I heard it through Jan.That pissed me off.
1483,01:17:42.10,01:17:44.80,"Yes, I did it out of anger,and I admit it."
1484,01:17:44.80,01:17:47.80,I completely admitI was not honest with you.
1485,01:17:47.80,01:17:50.57,"Okay, and part B: Why should Ivote for you tonight?"
1486,01:17:50.57,01:17:51.93,(sighs)
1487,01:17:51.93,01:17:55.73,"For one mistake, uh, for...for a, uh..."
1488,01:17:55.73,01:17:59.17,"a truth that I admit,an apology,"
1489,01:17:59.17,01:18:01.87,"a, uh, uh..."
1490,01:18:01.87,01:18:05.03,"period of 38, 37 days--whatever we spent together--"
1491,01:18:05.03,01:18:06.63,I made one mistake with you.
1492,01:18:06.63,01:18:09.27,"I didn't tell you you were goingthat night, and I apologize."
1493,01:18:09.27,01:18:11.17,I take full responsibilityfor that.
1494,01:18:11.17,01:18:14.13,I felt that youwere powerful enough
1495,01:18:14.13,01:18:16.47,to get me the following day.
1496,01:18:16.47,01:18:19.83,"That's how I felt,and I apologize."
1497,01:18:24.57,01:18:25.93,"It's a little late now, but..."
1498,01:18:27.67,01:18:30.97,"Clay, I'd sort of like youto explain to me"
1499,01:18:30.97,01:18:34.70,"why you think--and I'd actually like three,"
1500,01:18:34.70,01:18:38.27,if you can come up with three--reasons of how you
1501,01:18:38.27,01:18:42.27,contributed to eight people
1502,01:18:42.27,01:18:46.50,having to surviveon that island.
1503,01:18:46.50,01:18:49.67,"Uh, uh... I did stuff every day."
1504,01:18:49.67,01:18:51.60,I did a little bit every day.
1505,01:18:51.60,01:18:53.27,That's all I got to say.
1506,01:18:53.27,01:18:55.50,"I asked for three reasonson what, on a daily basis..."
1507,01:18:55.50,01:18:56.53,"CLAY: Well, you're notgonna get three."
1508,01:18:56.53,01:18:58.43,"Helen, you don't understand,because I can tell right now"
1509,01:18:58.43,01:19:00.90,there's no way in the worldto satisfy your answer.
1510,01:19:00.90,01:19:03.00,So why try?
1511,01:19:03.00,01:19:05.00,Okay. Okay.
1512,01:19:05.00,01:19:06.53,Then I'm satisfied.
1513,01:19:06.53,01:19:07.77,"-Thanks, Helen.-Thank you."
1514,01:19:10.40,01:19:12.87,"Jury, thank youfor your questions."
1515,01:19:12.87,01:19:15.27,You now havea big decision to make.
1516,01:19:15.27,01:19:19.43,Who will walk awaywith the title of sole Survivor?
1517,01:19:19.43,01:19:21.00,Take a minute. Think about it.
1518,01:19:44.67,01:19:46.17,"PROBST:Okay, jury."
1519,01:19:46.17,01:19:49.17,"Well, with everythingthat has been said tonight,"
1520,01:19:49.17,01:19:50.97,I hope you were able to gather
1521,01:19:50.97,01:19:52.97,the information you needto make your decision.
1522,01:19:52.97,01:19:55.30,The ball is now in your court.
1523,01:19:55.30,01:19:58.23,One very big differencein tonight's vote.
1524,01:19:58.23,01:20:03.10,"Tonight, the jury is voting for somebody;"
1525,01:20:03.10,01:20:05.17,you're not voting against.
1526,01:20:05.17,01:20:06.80,You're voting for who you think
1527,01:20:06.80,01:20:09.07,deserves the titleof sole Survivor.
1528,01:20:09.07,01:20:13.20,"Clay and Brian, you want to seeyour name on the ballot tonight."
1529,01:20:13.20,01:20:14.80,Big decision.You ready to make it?
1530,01:20:15.97,01:20:18.40,"It is time to vote.Erin, you're up."
1531,01:20:38.90,01:20:42.30,I'm actually votingfor Clay tonight.
1532,01:20:42.30,01:20:44.77," I'm basing my vote on honesty, and, Clay,"
1533,01:20:44.77,01:20:47.20, I feel that you have been honest to everyone.
1534,01:20:47.20,01:20:50.17,"On the other hand,I do not feel Brian has."
1535,01:20:53.63,01:20:55.83,Good luck.
1536,01:21:32.43,01:21:36.10,"You know, this would have been"
1537,01:21:36.10,01:21:38.80,"a very, very easy decision."
1538,01:21:38.80,01:21:41.73," You messed up, Brian. You messed up."
1539,01:21:41.73,01:21:42.73, You assumed
1540,01:21:42.73,01:21:45.17,that what we were writingin the sand
1541,01:21:45.17,01:21:47.43,was a scheme against you.
1542,01:21:47.43,01:21:49.07,It wasn't.
1543,01:21:49.07,01:21:50.43,It was a scheme
1544,01:21:50.43,01:21:52.80," against Clay, not you."
1545,01:21:52.80,01:21:54.10,You need to check yourself.
1546,01:21:54.10,01:21:55.63,I know that there arepeople out there
1547,01:21:55.63,01:21:56.80,that remain committedto their word.
1548,01:21:56.80,01:21:59.60, My word was my bond.
1549,01:21:59.60,01:22:02.60,And it's pitifulthat you didn't know that.
1550,01:22:02.60,01:22:05.93,But that you are the lesserof the two evils.
1551,01:22:35.63,01:22:37.50,"PENNY: I think that,"
1552,01:22:37.50,01:22:41.07,"uh, of the two that are left,um, that Clay"
1553,01:22:41.07,01:22:44.07, really took the time to get to know me as a person
1554,01:22:44.07,01:22:47.47,"in the 12 days I had with them, and Brian never did."
1555,01:23:24.27,01:23:26.07,"Brian, what happenedbetween you and I"
1556,01:23:26.07,01:23:27.67, happened between you and I.
1557,01:23:27.67,01:23:30.20,"But in the context of the game, I'm a bigger person"
1558,01:23:30.20,01:23:33.93,and can look beyondwhat happened to me.
1559,01:23:33.93,01:23:35.37, You deserve to win.
1560,01:23:35.37,01:23:37.47, You had a work ethic that was great
1561,01:23:37.47,01:23:38.90, the entire time out here.
1562,01:23:38.90,01:23:40.23,"Several of the team challenges,"
1563,01:23:40.23,01:23:43.27,"you almostsingle-handedly won on your own,"
1564,01:23:43.27,01:23:47.60,"so for that and your work ethic,you get my vote tonight."
1565,01:23:47.60,01:23:49.53,Good luck.
1566,01:23:51.30,01:23:53.23,Hope you win.
1567,01:24:06.37,01:24:08.20,I'll go tally the votes.
1568,01:24:36.50,01:24:38.13,(sighs)
1569,01:24:38.13,01:24:40.37,Been a long 39 days.
1570,01:24:40.37,01:24:42.80,Comes down to this.
1571,01:24:42.80,01:24:47.07,"Jury, thank you for your veryspirited comments"
1572,01:24:47.07,01:24:49.00,and questions.
1573,01:24:49.00,01:24:52.50,Here's what's at stakefor the winner:
1574,01:24:52.50,01:24:54.53,new Chevy Trailblazer.
1575,01:24:54.53,01:24:57.10,"Not a bad truck and if Brianknew how to spell ""road trip,"""
1576,01:24:57.10,01:24:58.40,he'd already own one.
