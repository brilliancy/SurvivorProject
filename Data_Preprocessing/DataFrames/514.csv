2,00:00:15.50,00:00:15.50,"JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago,  16 Americans began"
3,00:00:18.40,00:00:18.40, the adventure of a lifetime  in exotic Thailand.
4,00:00:23.13,00:00:23.13," They journeyed  to Tarutao Island,"
5,00:00:25.50,00:00:25.50, a former prison camp and one-time haven for pirates.
6,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97,"You're going to choose your own tribes, right now."
7,00:00:30.70,00:00:30.70, In keeping with  the Thai tradition of honoring
8,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17," the elders, the two oldest  castaways, Jake and Jan,"
9,00:00:36.77,00:00:36.77, were allowed to pick  their own tribes.
10,00:00:39.27,00:00:39.27,TED: I was surprised by Jan's picks.
11,00:00:41.67,00:00:41.67, It seems like
12,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,most of the tribe members
13,00:00:44.90,00:00:44.90," were older members,  if you will."
14,00:00:46.93,00:00:46.93,Survivors ready? Go!
15,00:00:48.93,00:00:48.93,"PROBST: From the beginning,  it looked as if"
16,00:00:50.27,00:00:50.27, the older Chuay Gahn tribe  would be the underdog.
17,00:00:53.37,00:00:53.37,Sook Jai wins immunity!
18,00:00:55.77,00:00:55.77,-I'm so sorry. -Don't worry about it. -No.
19,00:00:57.53,00:00:57.53, But Sook Jai  had trouble bonding.
20,00:00:59.63,00:00:59.63,"I'm not here to be yelled at by you, dude."
21,00:01:00.90,00:01:00.90,"I'm not yelling at you, sweetie."
22,00:01:02.07,00:01:02.07,"I'm saying I want to sleep tonight, okay?"
23,00:01:03.37,00:01:03.37,"How'd you sleep last night? Pretty good, huh?"
24,00:01:05.10,00:01:05.10,My point exactly. Walk away.
25,00:01:06.93,00:01:06.93,PROBST: And they let  their youthful enthusiasm
26,00:01:09.00,00:01:09.00, get the better of them.
27,00:01:10.87,00:01:10.87,"No, no, no!"
28,00:01:12.40,00:01:12.40,Chuay Gahn proved they could be  strong competitors.
29,00:01:15.47,00:01:15.47,Chuay Gahn wins reward!
30,00:01:17.30,00:01:17.30, But they also had  their own bumps in the road.
31,00:01:19.97,00:01:19.97,"For some crazy reason,"
32,00:01:22.20,00:01:22.20,"you know, in that position, I started grinding on Ghandia."
33,00:01:26.90,00:01:26.90,"To me, I got the feeling that you was trying to get with me."
34,00:01:28.90,00:01:28.90,No. No. No.
35,00:01:30.30,00:01:30.30,I'm not even attracted to you!
36,00:01:33.33,00:01:33.33,PROBST: The castaways  have experienced
37,00:01:35.27,00:01:35.27, the hardships of island life.
38,00:01:37.20,00:01:37.20,(screaming)
39,00:01:38.93,00:01:38.93,He probably pushed off on a stingray
40,00:01:40.73,00:01:40.73, and got a stinger in his foot.
41,00:01:42.83,00:01:42.83,"Damn, it ... hurts!"
42,00:01:44.67,00:01:44.67,HELEN: It was a nightmare. At  one point I was about ready--
43,00:01:46.43,00:01:46.43,"if I had a pistol in my pocket,  I would've pulled it out,"
44,00:01:48.40,00:01:48.40,"shot her first, shot me second."
45,00:01:50.40,00:01:50.40,PROBST: And they have  experienced the joys
46,00:01:52.50,00:01:52.50, of an exotic land.
47,00:01:53.90,00:01:53.90,SHII ANN: It was just wonderful  to be able to see
48,00:01:56.53,00:01:56.53, some of Thai culture.
49,00:01:59.93,00:01:59.93,CLAY:  It is absolutely gorgeous.
50,00:02:02.13,00:02:02.13, You got these limestone cliffs
51,00:02:04.10,00:02:04.10, and mountains  and hills and caves.
52,00:02:06.07,00:02:06.07, There's no way to describe
53,00:02:07.87,00:02:07.87,the beauty th-that's here.
54,00:02:10.83,00:02:10.83,PROBST:  They have clashed...
55,00:02:11.83,00:02:11.83,I'm not ... stupid.
56,00:02:13.47,00:02:13.47, ...and they have  overcome their differences.
57,00:02:15.33,00:02:15.33,"I'll tell you what, you're a good man."
58,00:02:16.57,00:02:16.57,I like you.
59,00:02:17.57,00:02:17.57,"ROBB: Amen, bro."
60,00:02:19.17,00:02:19.17," But no matter  how strong their bond,"
61,00:02:21.23,00:02:21.23, Tribal Council always loomed.
62,00:02:23.87,00:02:23.87," In the first 18 days,  three members from Sook Jai"
63,00:02:27.27,00:02:27.27, and three members from Chuay Gahn were voted off the island.
64,00:02:30.87,00:02:30.87," On day 19, the two tribes  moved onto one beach,"
65,00:02:34.57,00:02:34.57, and the castaways  believed they had merged.
66,00:02:37.17,00:02:37.17,"One, two, three."
67,00:02:38.70,00:02:38.70,Family!
68,00:02:39.70,00:02:39.70,(cheering)
69,00:02:41.03,00:02:41.03, But that wasn't the case.
70,00:02:42.37,00:02:42.37,"-You said, ""merge."" -Yes."
71,00:02:43.83,00:02:43.83,I certainly didn't say anything
72,00:02:44.87,00:02:44.87,"to give you that impression, did I?"
73,00:02:47.20,00:02:47.20,The two tribes never merged.
74,00:02:49.90,00:02:49.90, The false merge  sent strategies reeling
75,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70, and put desperation  right out in the open.
76,00:02:55.90,00:02:55.90,This is not a tribe unified.
77,00:02:57.67,00:02:57.67,"Penny, you're manipulative."
78,00:03:01.17,00:03:01.17,I've had plenty of opportunity
79,00:03:02.63,00:03:02.63,to vote Shii Ann out if I wanted to.
80,00:03:05.87,00:03:05.87,"PROBST: Sook Jai lost  another member, and the tribe"
81,00:03:08.73,00:03:08.73, was at a numbers disadvantage.
82,00:03:10.73,00:03:10.73, Living on the same beach  as two separate tribes
83,00:03:13.63,00:03:13.63, was a trying experience  for everyone.
84,00:03:16.30,00:03:16.30,KEN:  The cave smells of urine.
85,00:03:18.87,00:03:18.87,Chuay Gahn has been pissing in the front of the cave.
86,00:03:20.67,00:03:20.67,Cashew butterscotch squares.
87,00:03:22.33,00:03:22.33,"-Ooh, that sounds good. -Ooh, one of those."
88,00:03:24.60,00:03:24.60,"JAKE: My God. You know,  I need to go somewhere else"
89,00:03:26.87,00:03:26.87," when she starts  that recipe stuff,"
90,00:03:27.90,00:03:27.90,"which is nonstop, 24/7."
91,00:03:30.57,00:03:30.57,PROBST:  Even the monkeys were
92,00:03:31.87,00:03:31.87, testing the  castaways' patience.
93,00:03:34.07,00:03:34.07,All the bananas that were saved for tonight are gone.
94,00:03:36.23,00:03:36.23,"Oh, no."
95,00:03:39.90,00:03:39.90, Sook Jai continued  their downward spiral...
96,00:03:42.73,00:03:42.73,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
97,00:03:44.63,00:03:44.63, ...and lost another member.
98,00:03:47.17,00:03:47.17," When the merge finally  materialized on day 26,"
99,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,"the remaining Sook Jais, one by one, had their torches snuffed."
100,00:03:55.93,00:03:55.93," Last week, the time came  for the former"
101,00:03:58.80,00:03:58.80, Chuay Gahn tribe  to turn on each other.
102,00:04:01.67,00:04:01.67,Ted and Helen questioned Clay's  contributions to camp life.
103,00:04:05.17,00:04:05.17,TED:  I think the reason why
104,00:04:06.50,00:04:06.50,he's been around this long is because
105,00:04:08.03,00:04:08.03," he's a comical character,  he keeps us laughing."
106,00:04:10.87,00:04:10.87, But it's just time for him  to be voted off.
107,00:04:13.03,00:04:13.03,"PROBST: At the reward challenge,  Ted won a new car..."
108,00:04:16.23,00:04:16.23,-Ted wins reward! -Yeah!
109,00:04:17.23,00:04:17.23,"Yeah, baby!"
110,00:04:18.70,00:04:18.70, ...and chose to  take Helen with him
111,00:04:20.17,00:04:20.17, for a Thai dinner and massage.
112,00:04:22.03,00:04:22.03,Welcome.   Sawat-dee kha!
113,00:04:24.17,00:04:24.17, Sawat-dee kha!
114,00:04:25.83,00:04:25.83,PROBST:  Ted downed the wine...
115,00:04:27.87,00:04:27.87,Ah!
116,00:04:29.70,00:04:29.70, ...and tried to solidify  the plan to vote Clay out.
117,00:04:32.53,00:04:32.53,Clay.
118,00:04:33.90,00:04:33.90,-Yeah. -Out of here.
119,00:04:35.10,00:04:35.10,"You got to be quiet about that,"
120,00:04:36.97,00:04:36.97,"-you know what I'm saying? -Oh, yeah."
121,00:04:39.03,00:04:39.03,I forgot where I was.
122,00:04:41.67,00:04:41.67," PROBST: Back at camp,  the rest of the tribe"
123,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17, was growing nervous about  Ted and Helen's friendship.
124,00:04:47.13,00:04:47.13,What were you saying earlier about all the whispering?
125,00:04:49.17,00:04:49.17,Who was doing the whispering?
126,00:04:50.27,00:04:50.27,"Teddy and, um, Helen."
127,00:04:52.97,00:04:52.97,And writing in the dirt.
128,00:04:54.30,00:04:54.30,Hmm.
129,00:04:55.40,00:04:55.40,"PROBST:  But when Helen returned,"
130,00:04:57.23,00:04:57.23, she shared Ted's plan  with Brian.
131,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,"You know, I sat and listened to everything he said,"
132,00:05:01.20,00:05:01.20,"and I ""yeah, yeah, yeahed"" him to death."
133,00:05:02.77,00:05:02.77,"-Yeah, I know, I know. -Agreed, agreed, agreed."
134,00:05:04.77,00:05:04.77,Let Ted believe what he thinks he believes.
135,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30,HELEN: I'm definitely playing  two sides of the fence.
136,00:05:08.00,00:05:08.00, Everybody out here is playing  both sides of the fence.
137,00:05:10.27,00:05:10.27,Just hope you don't get caught.
138,00:05:11.73,00:05:11.73,PROBST: Strategies and alliances  were in question
139,00:05:14.67,00:05:14.67, when Brian won  the immunity challenge.
140,00:05:16.03,00:05:16.03,Brian wins immunity!
141,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"Good job, Brian."
142,00:05:19.13,00:05:19.13, So Ted asked Brian straight up  if he was the next to go.
143,00:05:22.83,00:05:22.83,"I'm asking you, brother to brother."
144,00:05:24.23,00:05:24.23,Okay.
145,00:05:25.50,00:05:25.50,Am I the next to go?
146,00:05:26.90,00:05:26.90,No. Uh-uh.
147,00:05:28.23,00:05:28.23," At Tribal Council,  Ted felt the sting of betrayal"
148,00:05:30.90,00:05:30.90, when he was  unanimously voted out
149,00:05:33.30,00:05:33.30, and sent off to join the jury.
150,00:05:36.27,00:05:36.27,"Ted, the tribe has spoken."
151,00:05:39.80,00:05:39.80," Now, only four remain."
152,00:05:42.17,00:05:42.17," Tonight, they will compete in"
153,00:05:43.60,00:05:43.60, their final  immunity challenges.
154,00:05:45.63,00:05:45.63," Two will move on to face  the jury, one will outlast"
155,00:05:49.07,00:05:49.07, all the rest and become  the sole Survivor.
156,00:07:06.57,00:07:06.57,"He didn't have too much to say on the way out, did he?"
157,00:07:09.03,00:07:09.03,He wouldn't even turn around and look at us when he was leaving.
158,00:07:13.50,00:07:13.50,(bats squeaking)
159,00:07:17.10,00:07:17.10,"Y'all, there's only four torches."
160,00:07:19.13,00:07:19.13,JAN: Yeah.
161,00:07:20.53,00:07:20.53,JAN:  Last Tribal Council was
162,00:07:22.07,00:07:22.07, a little bit harder  because Ted was
163,00:07:24.10,00:07:24.10,"the first of the, of the last Chuay Gahn five."
164,00:07:27.23,00:07:27.23,"Uh, it was the beginning of the realization"
165,00:07:31.33,00:07:31.33,"that each one of us have to go,  except for one."
166,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,HELEN: Ooh.
167,00:07:37.37,00:07:37.37,BRIAN: Nice.
168,00:07:39.07,00:07:39.07,Let there be light.
169,00:07:41.90,00:07:41.90,"CLAY: We knew that  when we got to this point,"
170,00:07:44.53,00:07:44.53, we was getting rid of Ted.
171,00:07:45.97,00:07:45.97, It was a total shock to Ted.
172,00:07:47.63,00:07:47.63,"The whole time we'd been telling him, ""We're kicking Jan off,"
173,00:07:49.83,00:07:49.83,"we're kicking Jan off."""
174,00:07:51.63,00:07:51.63,There ain't no telling what went through his mind
175,00:07:53.63,00:07:53.63,when he saw his name pop up three times.
176,00:07:56.03,00:07:56.03,I'm sure he was furious.
177,00:07:59.20,00:07:59.20,Mm-hmm. No hard feelings; we got to do what we got to do.
178,00:08:01.20,00:08:01.20,BRIAN: That's part of the game.
179,00:08:02.80,00:08:02.80,(yawns)
180,00:08:04.33,00:08:04.33,"HELEN: At this level  in the game,"
181,00:08:05.77,00:08:05.77, it becomes cutthroat.
182,00:08:07.37,00:08:07.37, It becomes  every man for himself.
183,00:08:10.00,00:08:10.00,So the next couple days I expect to be extremely stressful.
184,00:08:12.20,00:08:12.20,Final four-- sounds like a basketball tournament.
185,00:08:14.73,00:08:14.73,JAN: I know it. That's all I can think about.
186,00:08:16.23,00:08:16.23,You know.
187,00:08:17.60,00:08:17.60,JAN: Isn't that funny?
188,00:08:40.60,00:08:40.60,"HELEN: Oh, my gosh!"
189,00:08:42.07,00:08:42.07,"Santa Claus came, Clay."
190,00:08:43.50,00:08:43.50,CLAY: Good Lord.
191,00:08:45.13,00:08:45.13,"HELEN: Oh, look, it's everybody's name."
192,00:08:46.80,00:08:46.80,"-BRIAN: Oh. -CLAY: Oh, neat."
193,00:08:47.87,00:08:47.87,JAN: Oh!
194,00:08:49.30,00:08:49.30,HELEN: Here we go.
195,00:08:50.90,00:08:50.90,"""Lotus-shaped boat used in different Thai celebrations"
196,00:08:55.00,00:08:55.00,"""and a way of remembering those with whom"

204,00:09:16.57,00:09:16.57,"-All right. -Okay, let's take them all back to camp. -Okay."
205,00:09:18.37,00:09:18.37,"CLAY: This morning, we got an  early treemail; it was a bunch"
206,00:09:21.07,00:09:21.07," of flowers,  and we're supposed to fix up"
207,00:09:22.87,00:09:22.87, a float for each tribe member
208,00:09:24.87,00:09:24.87," that's been kicked off  the island, and, uh,"
209,00:09:27.00,00:09:27.00,there's some kind of tradition in Thailand
210,00:09:28.80,00:09:28.80,about sending something out to-to sea.
211,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67," You know, a message  out of love and hope"
212,00:09:33.77,00:09:33.77,and good luck in-in the future.
213,00:09:35.10,00:09:35.10, I think that's...  it's-it's what it's all about.
214,00:09:37.77,00:09:37.77,"We got a job to do, people."
215,00:09:41.87,00:09:41.87,-This is an example? -JAN: Right.
216,00:09:43.83,00:09:43.83,"Well, wait a minute, I got some tweezers or something in here."
217,00:09:46.07,00:09:46.07,I need toenail clippers bad.
218,00:09:49.63,00:09:49.63,Toothpicks.
219,00:09:51.00,00:09:51.00,Oh.
220,00:09:53.23,00:09:53.23,"HELEN: Oh, man, I've been dying for that."
221,00:09:55.93,00:09:55.93,We'll do them in order.
222,00:09:58.03,00:09:58.03,BRIAN: We're gonna go down the assembly line.
223,00:09:59.70,00:09:59.70,"JAN: Oh, that looks real good."
224,00:10:01.13,00:10:01.13,"HELEN: That looks really nice, Clay."
225,00:10:02.53,00:10:02.53,"CLAY:  I looked at each individual,"
226,00:10:04.33,00:10:04.33, and tried to put them
227,00:10:06.50,00:10:06.50, as I saw them.  We just tried to
228,00:10:08.53,00:10:08.53, fit the personalities  into each little float
229,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70,that we're going to send out to sea later on.
230,00:10:12.50,00:10:12.50,Erin was going to get a lotus tattooed
231,00:10:15.50,00:10:15.50,on her foot. Why don't we give her this lotus?
232,00:10:18.47,00:10:18.47,CLAY: Okay.
233,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97,"JAN: With 16 different  personalities, you're going to"
234,00:10:22.50,00:10:22.50," have people that generally  don't really like each other,"
235,00:10:25.20,00:10:25.20, but you learn to get along.
236,00:10:27.13,00:10:27.13, So even if you had  someone's wreath
237,00:10:29.33,00:10:29.33,"that you weren't particularly crazy about,"
238,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80,you still made it good.
239,00:10:33.20,00:10:33.20,"BRIAN: Why you spending so much time on Ghandia's, huh, Clay?"
240,00:10:35.30,00:10:35.30,I'm fittin' to stick your ass with a pin.
241,00:10:37.30,00:10:37.30,(chuckles)
242,00:10:38.67,00:10:38.67,"I'm being nice, 'cause nobody else will do it."
243,00:10:45.80,00:10:45.80,"BRIAN: When I was  making those wreaths,"
244,00:10:47.70,00:10:47.70," all's I thought about was, uh,"
245,00:10:48.77,00:10:48.77,"""You've come a long way, baby."""
246,00:10:53.67,00:10:53.67," You've had to make  some tough decisions,"
247,00:10:55.43,00:10:55.43, but I would so much rather be  in my position than looking at
248,00:10:58.47,00:10:58.47," one of those wreaths,  seeing my name on there."
249,00:11:00.77,00:11:00.77," This is a business trip,  strictly."
250,00:11:02.63,00:11:02.63, My attire is just
251,00:11:04.20,00:11:04.20,"beard and, uh, uh, bathing suits out here."
252,00:11:08.33,00:11:08.33,But I'm still in business mode.
253,00:11:19.80,00:11:19.80, CLAY: We got to get  the immunity today.
254,00:11:21.47,00:11:21.47,Okay. Either-- and then we'll wor... worry about tomorrow.
255,00:11:23.90,00:11:23.90,But the best thing is not to talk about it.
256,00:11:25.67,00:11:25.67,"-Oh, okay. -So they don't, you know-- Okay, good."
257,00:11:29.90,00:11:29.90,Oh!
258,00:11:32.40,00:11:32.40,Check the inside.
259,00:11:34.17,00:11:34.17,No. Okay.
260,00:11:35.37,00:11:35.37,On top.
261,00:11:36.87,00:11:36.87,That's cool.
262,00:11:38.00,00:11:38.00,"There's no ifs, ands or buts, Clay."
263,00:11:39.80,00:11:39.80,"No ifs, ands or buts."
264,00:11:40.90,00:11:40.90,-No. Won't happen with me. -Okay.
265,00:11:42.23,00:11:42.23,"I mean, this is outside the game."
266,00:11:43.37,00:11:43.37,Fine. That's right.
267,00:11:44.60,00:11:44.60,"We got treemail, guys!"
268,00:11:47.33,00:11:47.33,"Oh, great!"
269,00:11:48.93,00:11:48.93,Dust off your sail.
270,00:11:50.90,00:11:50.90,The one brain sail you have left.
271,00:11:52.80,00:11:52.80,"Oh, no."
272,00:11:53.83,00:11:53.83,"""Cell,"" not ""sail."""
273,00:11:55.10,00:11:55.10,Oh. (chuckles)
274,00:11:56.83,00:11:56.83,"""Only fools repeat mistakes, and hindsight's 20-20."
275,00:12:00.97,00:12:00.97,"""So cash in on what you've learned"
276,00:12:03.37,00:12:03.37,"and get closer to the money."""
277,00:12:04.73,00:12:04.73,Okay.
278,00:12:06.03,00:12:06.03,"-Well, that's-that's obvious... -Yeah. -Yeah."
279,00:12:07.77,00:12:07.77,...what it is.
280,00:12:08.80,00:12:08.80,What?
281,00:12:10.87,00:12:10.87,"What we've learned, here."
282,00:12:12.30,00:12:12.30,"Oh, okay, yeah."
283,00:12:25.10,00:12:25.10,"-Hello, guys. -Hello, Jeff."
284,00:12:26.63,00:12:26.63,Hi.
285,00:12:28.40,00:12:28.40,"Okay, at this point in the game, with only three days left"
286,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,"and only four people left, the only way"
287,00:12:35.43,00:12:35.43,to control your fate in this game is with immunity.
288,00:12:39.07,00:12:39.07,So let's get to today's immunity challenge.
289,00:12:41.47,00:12:41.47,"It is, appropriately enough, called Second Chance."
290,00:12:44.87,00:12:44.87,A chance to revisit certain aspects of challenges
291,00:12:47.47,00:12:47.47, you have tackled in the past.
292,00:12:49.20,00:12:49.20," On my go, you will  dig up a wicker ball."
293,00:12:51.87,00:12:51.87,Take that wicker ball with you over the bamboo balancing beam.
294,00:12:55.57,00:12:55.57," If you fall,  you got to start over."
295,00:12:57.77,00:12:57.77," When you've succeeded,  take your wicker ball"
296,00:12:59.40,00:12:59.40, through the fishnet tubing.
297,00:13:00.50,00:13:00.50, When you're finished with
298,00:13:01.87,00:13:01.87,"that part of the course, you're done with"
299,00:13:03.50,00:13:03.50, the wicker ball.  You'll put it on your torch.
300,00:13:05.10,00:13:05.10,You'll begin work on the slide puzzle.
301,00:13:06.47,00:13:06.47," Once you release the knife,  use the knife to cut the rope."
302,00:13:10.63,00:13:10.63, The rope will release  a bag of materials.
303,00:13:12.83,00:13:12.83,Take those materials with you into the jail cell.
304,00:13:14.67,00:13:14.67," Use the materials  to build a pole,"
305,00:13:17.13,00:13:17.13," retrieve the key,  unlock the door."
306,00:13:20.30,00:13:20.30," It's then a sprint  to the final buffet table,"
307,00:13:22.33,00:13:22.33, where we have a surprise  food item from our Thai menu.
308,00:13:26.73,00:13:26.73,First person to finish the course
309,00:13:28.27,00:13:28.27,and show me an empty mouth--
310,00:13:29.80,00:13:29.80,meaning you have consumed the food item entirely--
311,00:13:32.13,00:13:32.13,"-(chuckles): Oh, Lord. -wins immunity,"
312,00:13:34.33,00:13:34.33,is guaranteed a spot in the final three.
313,00:13:37.03,00:13:37.03,Stakes have never been bigger than this challenge.
314,00:13:39.30,00:13:39.30,-Make sense? -Yeah.
315,00:13:40.57,00:13:40.57,"Before we begin, Brian, I need that immunity."
316,00:13:47.37,00:13:47.37,Immunity back up for grabs.
317,00:13:49.80,00:13:49.80,Let's go.
318,00:13:51.33,00:13:51.33,"Here we go, guys. Immunity at stake"
319,00:13:52.50,00:13:52.50,and a guaranteed spot in the final three.
320,00:13:55.07,00:13:55.07,-Survivors ready? -Yeah.
321,00:13:56.83,00:13:56.83,Go!
322,00:14:10.00,00:14:10.00,Clay's the first one out with his wicker ball.
323,00:14:12.40,00:14:12.40,Heading for the balance beam.
324,00:14:16.23,00:14:16.23,"-Back to the start, Clay. -Sand makes you slip."
325,00:14:17.77,00:14:17.77,"Jan has her ball, starting on the bamboo balance beam."
326,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,Gets two steps in.
327,00:14:22.77,00:14:22.77,"Keep digging, guys."
328,00:14:24.67,00:14:24.67,"What, China?"
329,00:14:27.27,00:14:27.27,Clay's halfway.
330,00:14:28.83,00:14:28.83,Helen has her ball.
331,00:14:31.17,00:14:31.17,Clay's off the balance beam.
332,00:14:33.93,00:14:33.93,Clay is through the fishnet tubing.
333,00:14:35.50,00:14:35.50,"Not a big lead, guys."
334,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,Keep working it.
335,00:14:41.60,00:14:41.60,Brian's got his ball.
336,00:14:43.37,00:14:43.37,Everybody's on the bamboo.
337,00:14:45.03,00:14:45.03,Clay's just a little bit ahead.
338,00:14:46.43,00:14:46.43,"Keep moving, guys."
339,00:14:47.73,00:14:47.73,Still very much in this.
340,00:14:57.40,00:14:57.40,Brian's off the bamboo and through the fishnet.
341,00:15:00.30,00:15:00.30,(mutters) Oh! Whoa!
342,00:15:02.23,00:15:02.23,"PROBST: Guys on the balance beam, look where you're going."
343,00:15:08.70,00:15:08.70,Brian making his way through the fish tubing.
344,00:15:14.13,00:15:14.13,"Brian creeping up on you, Clay."
345,00:15:23.53,00:15:23.53,Way to keep fighting.
346,00:15:30.07,00:15:30.07,(screams)
347,00:15:43.00,00:15:43.00,Brian has his knife out.
348,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,Screwing up his puzzle so Clay can't look over and copy.
349,00:15:59.27,00:15:59.27,Brian's moving into the jail cell.
350,00:16:01.87,00:16:01.87,"CLAY: I'm trying, I'm trying!"
351,00:16:04.37,00:16:04.37,PROBST: Brian's starting work on his pole.
352,00:16:07.87,00:16:07.87,"That a way, Helen. You're there. You're halfway there."
353,00:16:10.60,00:16:10.60,It's a sprint to the bottom now.
354,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,"Go, Jan."
355,00:16:28.30,00:16:28.30,Brian's got his key.
356,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,"That a way, Helen."
357,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,Right back in it.
358,00:16:38.13,00:16:38.13,Brian's out of the jail cell.
359,00:16:42.13,00:16:42.13,Hallelujah!
360,00:16:44.07,00:16:44.07,"-That a way, Janny! -Yes!"
361,00:16:57.00,00:16:57.00,Got to eat it all?
362,00:16:58.23,00:16:58.23,"PROBST: You got to eat it all, brother."
363,00:17:00.23,00:17:00.23,Don't mess around.
364,00:17:06.23,00:17:06.23,Put that thing down and start chewing.
365,00:17:11.87,00:17:11.87,Keep it down.
366,00:17:21.57,00:17:21.57,Let me see that whole mouth.
367,00:17:24.13,00:17:24.13,Brian wins immunity!
368,00:17:28.97,00:17:28.97,That was nasty.
369,00:17:42.73,00:17:42.73,You have come a long way.
370,00:17:44.87,00:17:44.87,One of you will go no further.
371,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,Somebody's going home after Tribal Council.
372,00:18:19.03,00:18:19.03,"Oh, boy."
373,00:18:21.40,00:18:21.40,"Even as I was doing it,"
374,00:18:22.67,00:18:22.67,I could feel myself getting so angry I was shaking.
375,00:18:26.07,00:18:26.07,HELEN:  I hate to lose.
376,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,I hate to lose.
377,00:18:28.53,00:18:28.53,"And I hate to look like a fool doing it, and I did both today."
378,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,That damn balance thing.
379,00:18:33.57,00:18:33.57,I just felt like I looked like an idiot.
380,00:18:35.17,00:18:35.17," Ever since the immunity  challenge was over,"
381,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,"the minute I knew I didn't have it,"
382,00:18:38.67,00:18:38.67,"I was like, okay, now what?"
383,00:18:45.93,00:18:45.93,BRIAN: It looks like  it's time for Helen to go.
384,00:18:48.37,00:18:48.37,Why Helen now at this time is--
385,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,there was some sort of relationship with her and Ted;
386,00:18:54.53,00:18:54.53,it just happened the other day.
387,00:18:56.23,00:18:56.23, There was some writing  on the ground.
388,00:18:58.40,00:18:58.40, So I have a little distrust  in Helen.
389,00:19:01.40,00:19:01.40,I know they were scheming against us.
390,00:19:02.80,00:19:02.80,"I mean, Jan was supposedly sleeping,"
391,00:19:04.60,00:19:04.60,they were doing stuff in the dirt here.
392,00:19:06.13,00:19:06.13,"-Oh, I saw... I saw writing. -Placing in order."
393,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,"When I raised up and looked, they started playing like"
394,00:19:09.07,00:19:09.07,they was playing Tic Tac Toe.
395,00:19:10.43,00:19:10.43,It's some sort of order they were going.
396,00:19:12.03,00:19:12.03,"So that, uh-- I know that, uh, Helen's"
397,00:19:14.57,00:19:14.57,"-going to go down fighting tomorrow, no matter what. -Yeah."
398,00:19:16.77,00:19:16.77,"She's a threat, and she's making me nervous now with everything"
399,00:19:19.37,00:19:19.37,the same and I'm not still in the picture and--
400,00:19:20.93,00:19:20.93,I'm just getting-- she's making me nervous.
401,00:19:22.27,00:19:22.27,"BRIAN:  Helen's got to go now,"
402,00:19:23.87,00:19:23.87,simply because she's a threat to me.
403,00:19:26.40,00:19:26.40,"Jan, you know where the vote's going, correct?"
404,00:19:29.43,00:19:29.43,-Me? -No.
405,00:19:30.90,00:19:30.90,Who?
406,00:19:32.13,00:19:32.13,-Helen. -No.
407,00:19:34.43,00:19:34.43,I-- this is the first I've heard of it.
408,00:19:36.93,00:19:36.93,"This is strictly strategy, just think about it."
409,00:19:41.93,00:19:41.93,It's not your turn.
410,00:19:47.10,00:19:47.10,"BRIAN: Jan-- she's my ace  in the hole,"
411,00:19:49.77,00:19:49.77," and I will use her, uh,  tonight."
412,00:19:51.43,00:19:51.43,"As long as everything goes as planned,"
413,00:19:53.90,00:19:53.90,she'll come into play.
414,00:19:55.77,00:19:55.77,"Now, whether, uh, whether everything does go as planned,"
415,00:19:58.73,00:19:58.73,that's one thing I can't control.
416,00:20:00.90,00:20:00.90,You can't get emotional over this decision.
417,00:20:02.90,00:20:02.90,-Right. -It's strictly a strategic position.
418,00:20:04.43,00:20:04.43,-Right. -But if you're not
419,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,"comfortable with it, then-then, uh, I-I understand, also."
420,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,"But I would, uh, just like you to, uh, think about it,"
421,00:20:12.20,00:20:12.20,"and that's, I mean, that's the way"
422,00:20:14.10,00:20:14.10,"we would, uh, kind of like to go."
423,00:20:15.63,00:20:15.63,"-Right. -I mentioned it, also, to Clay."
424,00:20:18.03,00:20:18.03,"You understand, you're-- it'll be helping your pocketbook, too."
425,00:20:21.30,00:20:21.30,And it's you or her.
426,00:20:23.50,00:20:23.50,"I just, you know, I don't want y'all to be saying,"
427,00:20:26.47,00:20:26.47,"""We're putting Jan out"" and then, you know..."
428,00:20:28.63,00:20:28.63,"I'm not... I'm not playing a game. No, we're not playing--"
429,00:20:30.10,00:20:30.10,I'm going to take her out in about an hour
430,00:20:31.73,00:20:31.73,-Uh-huh. -and talk to her.
431,00:20:33.17,00:20:33.17,You have to just understand that
432,00:20:34.50,00:20:34.50,you're now-- can be three.
433,00:20:36.40,00:20:36.40,-Mm-hmm. -Which is quite a feat.
434,00:20:38.33,00:20:38.33,But the time has come to make a decision.
435,00:20:41.10,00:20:41.10,"And, uh... it's Helen's time."
436,00:20:45.47,00:20:45.47,Are you okay with that?
437,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,"I just want to think about it and see, and, um,"
438,00:20:51.50,00:20:51.50,"you know, I'm just, I'm just going to ponder what's going on."
439,00:20:55.47,00:20:55.47,"Is that a deal, Jan?"
440,00:20:57.43,00:20:57.43,"Let me just, let me just take a nap and rest on it, guys."
441,00:21:00.73,00:21:00.73,"Yeah, I'll think about it."
442,00:21:01.73,00:21:01.73,And I'd appreciate you--
443,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,"-Thanks, guys. -Get... Get some rest."
444,00:21:04.33,00:21:04.33,"No, thank you, Jan."
445,00:21:05.43,00:21:05.43,"Oh, my one cell is being very overworked."
446,00:21:08.23,00:21:08.23,-(laughs) -It's all strategy.
447,00:21:09.53,00:21:09.53,That's all it is.
448,00:21:11.60,00:21:11.60,"Oh, God, I'm going to kill myself."
449,00:21:15.50,00:21:15.50,I have been approached
450,00:21:17.37,00:21:17.37,"for a new game plan, and,"
451,00:21:20.70,00:21:20.70," um, I am toying with  the suggestion."
452,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50, Helen is a friend of mine.
453,00:21:26.57,00:21:26.57," She has cooked the meals,"
454,00:21:28.03,00:21:28.03, she sings at night  to help calm us down.
455,00:21:31.00,00:21:31.00, So I feel like  I'm in a quandary.
456,00:21:32.70,00:21:32.70,That makes me anxious.
457,00:21:34.87,00:21:34.87,She can't change her mind.
458,00:21:37.23,00:21:37.23,"What we'll do, we'll change our vote and vote her."
459,00:21:39.20,00:21:39.20,"I think she'll be okay, she just needs to relax."
460,00:21:41.27,00:21:41.27,I don't know.
461,00:21:42.57,00:21:42.57,Hope it works.
462,00:21:47.30,00:21:47.30,The only other issue is
463,00:21:49.73,00:21:49.73,"what I'm going to tell Helen, if I, if I'm going to."
464,00:21:52.63,00:21:52.63,It's going to pop up her name three times
465,00:21:55.10,00:21:55.10,"and she'll get the message, for sure then."
466,00:22:01.63,00:22:01.63,"HELEN:  Weeks ago, Brian and Clay"
467,00:22:03.07,00:22:03.07,"came to me and said, uh, ""How about us three for the top?"""
468,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93," The vote that was agreed upon  was start with Ted, then Jan,"
469,00:22:11.90,00:22:11.90," then when we get to us three,  then we'll reevaluate."
470,00:22:14.53,00:22:14.53," Well, I know darn well  Clay sees himself"
471,00:22:16.00,00:22:16.00, in those first two chairs.
472,00:22:17.37,00:22:17.37, So it worries me  that they may decide that Jan
473,00:22:21.13,00:22:21.13," is an easier person  to keep along, so I"
474,00:22:24.40,00:22:24.40,checked last night to make sure it was still a Ted vote-- yes.
475,00:22:28.27,00:22:28.27,"Okay. Checked today with both of them, it's still a Jan vote."
476,00:22:31.20,00:22:31.20,"Now, you can ask him. Don't you think you ought"
477,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,to just not talk about it with Janny?
478,00:22:36.63,00:22:36.63,You think it's fair to tell Jan she's going?
479,00:22:38.77,00:22:38.77,CLAY: I think you ought to leave...
480,00:22:40.37,00:22:40.37,That just makes her upset all day.
481,00:22:41.80,00:22:41.80,"Soon as we got here, she went back down in the cave."
482,00:22:44.23,00:22:44.23,Just let her by herself and let her get through the day.
483,00:22:47.30,00:22:47.30,Don't upset her.
484,00:22:48.90,00:22:48.90,HELEN: Brian and Clay  have had it with Jan.
485,00:22:50.50,00:22:50.50," They're frustrated with her.  I mean, that's the story"
486,00:22:52.73,00:22:52.73,they're giving me and that it's a definite
487,00:22:54.93,00:22:54.93, she's out tonight.
488,00:23:26.57,00:23:26.57,We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
489,00:23:27.67,00:23:27.67,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake"
490,00:23:30.70,00:23:30.70,"and our newest jury member, Ted,"
491,00:23:32.43,00:23:32.43,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
492,00:23:36.83,00:23:36.83,"Just before we voted at the last Tribal Council,"
493,00:23:40.63,00:23:40.63,"I asked, at the time the five of you, if anybody felt vulnerable."
494,00:23:44.63,00:23:44.63,"Everybody shook their head and I said,"
495,00:23:46.07,00:23:46.07,"""So that must mean everybody feels safe,"
496,00:23:48.13,00:23:48.13,"which means somebody is clearly being lied to."""
497,00:23:50.77,00:23:50.77,"And from where I sit, they were."
498,00:23:52.97,00:23:52.97,"You voted out Ted, and I don't think he saw it coming."
499,00:23:56.07,00:23:56.07,So now we have a jury made up of
500,00:23:59.33,00:23:59.33,"four Sook Jai members and one of your own Chuay Gahn members,"
501,00:24:03.50,00:24:03.50,"for all intents and purposes, you betrayed."
502,00:24:06.53,00:24:06.53,"Clay, smart way to play this game,"
503,00:24:09.07,00:24:09.07,knowing your fate is in their hands?
504,00:24:12.37,00:24:12.37,"Uh, I wouldn't call it betrayed."
505,00:24:14.60,00:24:14.60,"I mean, everybody has to be removed from the game"
506,00:24:17.40,00:24:17.40,to get down to the final two.
507,00:24:18.80,00:24:18.80,That's the way this game is played.
508,00:24:21.43,00:24:21.43,"And, uh, lying is part of the game."
509,00:24:23.47,00:24:23.47,This a-a-a game of people playing people.
510,00:24:26.10,00:24:26.10,Who do you trust by looking them in the eye?
511,00:24:28.97,00:24:28.97,I'm sure I've said some things
512,00:24:30.23,00:24:30.23,where I wanted people to take them another way.
513,00:24:32.07,00:24:32.07,"-It kept Clay in the game. -PROBST: So, Jan,"
514,00:24:34.70,00:24:34.70,you basically looked another tribe member in the eye
515,00:24:37.93,00:24:37.93,and lied to them.
516,00:24:39.03,00:24:39.03,They're now on the other side.
517,00:24:40.30,00:24:40.30,"Well, I didn't lie to him."
518,00:24:42.40,00:24:42.40,I just voted to keep myself in the game.
519,00:24:45.30,00:24:45.30,So maybe I'm making an assumption.
520,00:24:47.63,00:24:47.63,"So, then, was it a coincidence that everybody"
521,00:24:50.00,00:24:50.00,voted for Ted except Ted?
522,00:24:51.73,00:24:51.73,(chuckles)
523,00:24:53.00,00:24:53.00,"Uh... uh, I-I have... I don't know."
524,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,"I don't think so, but I did not say one thing to Ted"
525,00:24:59.87,00:24:59.87,about going to vote against him.
526,00:25:02.07,00:25:02.07,"But he did not ask me, either."
527,00:25:04.93,00:25:04.93,"Brian, have you lied in this game?"
528,00:25:06.57,00:25:06.57,"No, I've not lied."
529,00:25:07.77,00:25:07.77,"I've, uh, changed my mind a few times."
530,00:25:09.43,00:25:09.43,"There's been, uh, certain situations"
531,00:25:11.13,00:25:11.13,"where things could have been put out in the open,"
532,00:25:13.43,00:25:13.43,"friendships could have remained blossoming, but, uh,"
533,00:25:16.73,00:25:16.73,some people have chosen to take other routes
534,00:25:18.40,00:25:18.40,"and have, uh, decided to actually, uh..."
535,00:25:21.90,00:25:21.90,"uh, to deceive."
536,00:25:24.77,00:25:24.77,So you think you've been lied to?
537,00:25:26.67,00:25:26.67,Yes. I've been deceived.
538,00:25:28.50,00:25:28.50,"And that's expected to happen, and, uh, it just..."
539,00:25:32.80,00:25:32.80,"you don't think it's going to happen, uh, to you."
540,00:25:35.63,00:25:35.63,"Helen, think you've been lied to?"
541,00:25:37.00,00:25:37.00,"Oh, I know I've been lied to."
542,00:25:40.90,00:25:40.90,"Clay, think you've been lied to?"
543,00:25:41.93,00:25:41.93,Know for a fact I've been lied to.
544,00:25:43.73,00:25:43.73,"And, uh, I just dealt them a card right back."
545,00:25:46.50,00:25:46.50,PROBST: So how is there any loyalty at all
546,00:25:49.30,00:25:49.30,-in this game at this point? -CLAY: There's not.
547,00:25:51.23,00:25:51.23,The only safe move in this game--
548,00:25:53.13,00:25:53.13,"if you got that necklace on, and that's it."
549,00:25:55.63,00:25:55.63,We're three vulnerable right now.
550,00:25:57.60,00:25:57.60,He's safe; we're not.
551,00:25:59.53,00:25:59.53,"So, clearly, Helen, at this point,"
552,00:26:02.70,00:26:02.70,how can you trust any of these people
553,00:26:05.60,00:26:05.60,when you walk up there to vote?
554,00:26:06.90,00:26:06.90,You can't.
555,00:26:09.23,00:26:09.23,"Flat out, you can't."
556,00:26:10.53,00:26:10.53,"It's getting down to the wire, and, um,"
557,00:26:12.80,00:26:12.80,"you tell someone honestly, ""This is who I'm voting for tonight,"""
558,00:26:16.23,00:26:16.23,"and then, all of a sudden, maybe right before the vote,"
559,00:26:18.87,00:26:18.87,"you get a signal from your bloc,"
560,00:26:21.80,00:26:21.80,"""Uh-uh, that's not the way we're going; we're going this way."""
561,00:26:24.53,00:26:24.53,"And then you go, ""Oh, great."""
562,00:26:26.53,00:26:26.53,"This person now says, ""You lied."""
563,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,"And, to them, that's the way it is."
564,00:26:31.70,00:26:31.70,So let me ask you the same question I asked Jan earlier.
565,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,"Was it coincidence that Ted ended up with all the votes,"
566,00:26:37.03,00:26:37.03,or was there one of these blocs?
567,00:26:39.43,00:26:39.43,It was a bloc.
568,00:26:41.20,00:26:41.20,"Clay, knowing you're already a little in trouble"
569,00:26:44.40,00:26:44.40,"with four Sook Jai members,"
570,00:26:46.10,00:26:46.10,"maybe we should tell Ted he's still going,"
571,00:26:49.07,00:26:49.07,and maybe we'd get a little loyalty from him in the end.
572,00:26:51.53,00:26:51.53,"Uh, I looked at this way-- I wouldn't want to know,"
573,00:26:54.53,00:26:54.53,"and, uh, I need to get rid of the biggest people"
574,00:26:57.33,00:26:57.33,that I feel most threatened by.
575,00:26:59.47,00:26:59.47,We're not talking $20; we're talking a million dollars.
576,00:27:02.03,00:27:02.03,And you're not judged on your... your lying
577,00:27:04.37,00:27:04.37,or your performance on this game as you are in life.
578,00:27:06.77,00:27:06.77,"This is a game, and, uh, we're here"
579,00:27:08.60,00:27:08.60,to play it the best we can and win.
580,00:27:10.87,00:27:10.87,It is time to vote. Brian.
581,00:27:25.47,00:27:25.47,Cause and effect.
582,00:27:27.37,00:27:27.37,You caused this effect.
583,00:28:05.60,00:28:05.60,"You got busted, uh, talking on both sides of the fence."
584,00:28:09.20,00:28:09.20,"You're a hell of a cook, and I'll miss you,"
585,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,but I will kiss the cook later in life.
586,00:28:14.27,00:28:14.27,Good-bye.
587,00:28:17.17,00:28:17.17,I'll go tally the votes.
588,00:28:29.90,00:28:29.90,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
589,00:28:32.43,00:28:32.43,The person will be asked to leave
590,00:28:33.73,00:28:33.73,the Tribal Council area immediately.
591,00:28:34.93,00:28:34.93,I'll read the votes.
592,00:28:38.33,00:28:38.33,First vote.
593,00:28:42.93,00:28:42.93,Helen.
594,00:28:47.53,00:28:47.53,Helen.
595,00:28:49.43,00:28:49.43,That's two votes-- Helen.
596,00:28:54.37,00:28:54.37,Jan.
597,00:28:59.73,00:28:59.73,The 13th member voted out of the tribe:
598,00:29:01.77,00:29:01.77,Helen.
599,00:29:03.77,00:29:03.77,Need to bring me your torch.
600,00:29:15.90,00:29:15.90,"Helen, the tribe has spoken."
601,00:29:20.27,00:29:20.27,It's time for you to go.
602,00:29:36.53,00:29:36.53,You've lasted 37 very tough days.
603,00:29:39.67,00:29:39.67,You've made it to the final three.
604,00:29:42.30,00:29:42.30,And tomorrow will be one of the most memorable days yet.
605,00:29:44.83,00:29:44.83,So head back to camp. Get some sleep.
606,00:29:50.10,00:29:50.10,"Well, that was a shock."
607,00:29:51.47,00:29:51.47,"Um, especially since I asked,"
608,00:29:54.17,00:29:54.17," uh, Brian directly if I should  plan on coming back tonight"
609,00:29:58.30,00:29:58.30, and I was given  an emphatic yes.
610,00:30:00.90,00:30:00.90,"So I guess, of the three knives  in my back right now,"
611,00:30:03.40,00:30:03.40," uh, that's the one  that smarts the most."
612,00:30:05.93,00:30:05.93,"So, uh, the three of you that are left, break a leg."
613,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,And I mean it.
614,00:30:24.03,00:30:24.03,CLAY: A very memorable and emotional day.
615,00:30:28.03,00:30:28.03,"JAN (sighs): Thank you, guys."
616,00:30:30.20,00:30:30.20,CLAY: You're welcome. Thank you.
617,00:30:32.20,00:30:32.20,"JAN: When we came back  as the final three,"
618,00:30:35.37,00:30:35.37,it was one of those good/sad things for me.
619,00:30:38.60,00:30:38.60,"-Thank you, Brian. -Thank you."
620,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,JAN: I felt a little empty  without Helen
621,00:30:45.93,00:30:45.93," because I thought  she had worked hard,"
622,00:30:47.90,00:30:47.90,"and, um, I thought she still deserved one of the places."
623,00:30:51.40,00:30:51.40,"BRIAN: I didn't think Helen would lose it,"
624,00:30:52.80,00:30:52.80,but she actually lost it the last couple days.
625,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,"-She did. -I... I didn't, either."
626,00:30:55.93,00:30:55.93,"I mean, everything was fine"
627,00:30:57.63,00:30:57.63,"up until, uh, recently, then all of a sudden,"
628,00:31:00.10,00:31:00.10,she got real antsy and nervous and sketchy.
629,00:31:02.40,00:31:02.40,"CLAY: When, uh, Helen saw her name pop up for the third time,"
630,00:31:04.93,00:31:04.93, I hope it felt like a truck  hit her right in the stomach.
631,00:31:07.57,00:31:07.57, Whammo! We slapped you  right in front
632,00:31:09.30,00:31:09.30,"of your Council members. And, uh, you know what?"
633,00:31:11.87,00:31:11.87,"You still got to vote for one of us,"
634,00:31:13.67,00:31:13.67,"and all three of us voted for you,"
635,00:31:15.27,00:31:15.27,so who you going to blame?
636,00:31:17.00,00:31:17.00,Let's just kind of hold here...
637,00:31:18.77,00:31:18.77,Watch your toes. Watch your feet.
638,00:31:20.43,00:31:20.43,"JAN: We got back  from Tribal Council,"
639,00:31:22.67,00:31:22.67," then all of a sudden,  we had treemail."
640,00:31:24.73,00:31:24.73,"Um, okay, I'm going to go in here."
641,00:31:26.30,00:31:26.30,On top? Oh...
642,00:31:27.63,00:31:27.63,"Here's... Oh. Oh, my gosh."
643,00:31:29.07,00:31:29.07,-JAN: What is it? -That was quick.
644,00:31:30.57,00:31:30.57,-What is it? -Look.
645,00:31:31.80,00:31:31.80,I don't see it.
646,00:31:33.07,00:31:33.07,"Oh, no, it's Helen's riverboat."
647,00:31:34.70,00:31:34.70,"Oh, it's just... that's awful."
648,00:31:37.13,00:31:37.13,"JAN: We went down there, and  there was, uh, Helen's thing"
649,00:31:40.47,00:31:40.47, for us to make  to float down the river.
650,00:31:42.40,00:31:42.40, I felt a little bit bad.
651,00:31:44.13,00:31:44.13,I just thought it was real soon
652,00:31:45.57,00:31:45.57,to be feeling like you buried someone.
653,00:31:49.90,00:31:49.90,"Okay. ""Before you sleep, make one last krathong"
654,00:31:53.77,00:31:53.77,"in memory of the person you've just set adrift."""
655,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,-Okay. -What about getting over here and we'll start it?
656,00:31:58.77,00:31:58.77,I'm going to tie a spoon--
657,00:32:01.13,00:32:01.13,"one of the spoons that we cook with-- around her, uh, lei."
658,00:32:05.13,00:32:05.13,JAN: And I wanted  to make sure that we
659,00:32:07.43,00:32:07.43," did a good one, you know,  so we put a spoon on it"
660,00:32:10.37,00:32:10.37,"'cause, uh, of her cooking and everything."
661,00:32:12.70,00:32:12.70,CLAY: Here we go.
662,00:32:15.67,00:32:15.67,"No, that's a good idea, I think, with the spoon."
663,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,"-JAN: I thought so, too. -Yeah."
664,00:32:18.30,00:32:18.30,BRIAN: I wanted to make sure  she had a proper burial.
665,00:32:19.97,00:32:19.97,"I called her my Aunt Helen,"
666,00:32:21.43,00:32:21.43,"but I almost felt closer to her, like somewhat of a sister,"
667,00:32:23.97,00:32:23.97,but I'm wondering now if she's the sister that went bad.
668,00:32:56.43,00:32:56.43,"BRIAN: That is a beautiful, uh, sight."
669,00:32:57.97,00:32:57.97,CLAY: Looks like a picture somebody painted.
670,00:32:59.97,00:32:59.97,"-BRIAN: Yeah, it does. -JAN: Uh-huh."
671,00:33:01.63,00:33:01.63,"I swear, look at the red lines going straight here to us."
672,00:33:05.00,00:33:05.00,That is too cool.
673,00:33:07.73,00:33:07.73,"Wish I had a belly full of food, but I don't."
674,00:33:10.00,00:33:10.00,And some coffee.
675,00:33:11.63,00:33:11.63,"CLAY: Me, Brian and Jan, we're  just sitting there talking,"
676,00:33:13.80,00:33:13.80," and I was playing  like I was, uh..."
677,00:33:15.80,00:33:15.80, started drinking  a cup of coffee.
678,00:33:17.50,00:33:17.50,"And I said, ""Oh, by the way, I got some donuts over here."""
679,00:33:19.93,00:33:19.93," So I passed out the donuts,"
680,00:33:21.33,00:33:21.33, and we were just eating donuts  and drinking coffee--
681,00:33:23.43,00:33:23.43," like, we were just really  getting our belly full."
682,00:33:25.37,00:33:25.37,"-We got three pancakes, two eggs, -Bacon."
683,00:33:27.10,00:33:27.10,"one strip of bacon, small glass of orange juice"
684,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,and a cup of coffee.
685,00:33:30.93,00:33:30.93,Ask... go ahead and send me my breakfast.
686,00:33:32.57,00:33:32.57,I want the pancakes and the bacon and the sausage.
687,00:33:38.60,00:33:38.60,There's a canoe.
688,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,"Wait, there's a boat!"
689,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,-Who is that? -There's a canoe out there.
690,00:33:43.53,00:33:43.53,"CLAY: All of a sudden,  we see this boat pull up."
691,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,It's Jeff!
692,00:33:47.37,00:33:47.37, There's Jeff standing up  in that... this little boat
693,00:33:49.47,00:33:49.47," had three, uh,  uh, umbrellas on it."
694,00:33:52.33,00:33:52.33,"Hey, guys."
695,00:33:53.70,00:33:53.70,Welcome to our home.
696,00:33:55.90,00:33:55.90,Nice to be welcomed.
697,00:33:57.33,00:33:57.33,I come bearing the items
698,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,you will need for your final rite of passage.
699,00:34:01.03,00:34:01.03,This boat will carry you on your journey.
700,00:34:04.53,00:34:04.53,This map will lead the way.
701,00:34:07.10,00:34:07.10,"You will leave your beach, paddling north,"
702,00:34:10.23,00:34:10.23, out around the island  to the Mangrove River.
703,00:34:12.67,00:34:12.67," When you reach the river,"
704,00:34:14.10,00:34:14.10, you'll begin to release  your loy krathongs.
705,00:34:15.90,00:34:15.90, The krathongs are a tribute
706,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50,to the 13 other Survivors
707,00:34:20.43,00:34:20.43,who have been a part of this adventure...
708,00:34:22.17,00:34:22.17,"Oh, I'm going to cry."
709,00:34:24.27,00:34:24.27,...but are no longer in the game.
710,00:34:26.73,00:34:26.73,This is a part of the tradition here in Thailand.
711,00:34:28.80,00:34:28.80,"It is where you offer your respects,"
712,00:34:30.87,00:34:30.87,so take a moment and reflect over each person.
713,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,"As you continue down the river, you'll reach a cave."
714,00:34:37.63,00:34:37.63,I'll be waiting for you at your final immunity challenge.
715,00:34:41.07,00:34:41.07,-Great. -Okay.
716,00:34:42.27,00:34:42.27,When do we need to leave? Pretty quick?
717,00:34:43.90,00:34:43.90,-You go now. -Okay.
718,00:34:45.10,00:34:45.10,"-CLAY: Okay, y'all ready? -BRIAN: Yeah."
719,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,-PROBST: You'll head out north. -Go right around here?
720,00:34:49.63,00:34:49.63,-You'll know it-- big change in water. -Okay.
721,00:35:20.53,00:35:20.53,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
722,00:35:51.23,00:35:51.23,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
723,00:36:21.33,00:36:21.33,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

729,00:39:20.37,00:39:20.37,-BRIAN: Where are we? -CLAY: Whoa.
730,00:39:22.07,00:39:22.07,"-JAN: Oh, my gosh. -BRIAN: Wow."
731,00:39:25.70,00:39:25.70,CLAY: Lord have... Y'all watch your step.
732,00:39:27.17,00:39:27.17,BRIAN: Okay. Follow the path.
733,00:39:37.33,00:39:37.33,Come on in. Place your torches on the stand to the left.
734,00:39:41.27,00:39:41.27,It is hot in here. It's about 105 degrees.
735,00:39:46.63,00:39:46.63,"Welcome to the belly of the whale,"
736,00:39:49.50,00:39:49.50,your final immunity challenge.
737,00:39:51.70,00:39:51.70,Congratulations on making it this far.
738,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,-Thank you. -Thank you.
739,00:39:55.90,00:39:55.90,"You guys have overcome tremendous odds,"
740,00:39:58.13,00:39:58.13,"battled obstacles, crossing threshold after threshold,"
741,00:40:01.80,00:40:01.80,getting closer and closer to your reward.
742,00:40:05.37,00:40:05.37,The treasure. The money.
743,00:40:07.63,00:40:07.63,And the title of sole Survivor.
744,00:40:10.77,00:40:10.77,It's fitting that this final ordeal plays out
745,00:40:14.57,00:40:14.57,here in the darkest part of a cave that was once the home
746,00:40:17.63,00:40:17.63,to the pirates who ruled this island.
747,00:40:20.10,00:40:20.10,"You know, it's so easy in this game of Survivor"
748,00:40:23.77,00:40:23.77,to let the money slip through your fingers.
749,00:40:26.77,00:40:26.77,"Lose a challenge, make a bad political move at camp,"
750,00:40:30.20,00:40:30.20,trusting when you shouldn't.
751,00:40:32.57,00:40:32.57,13 of your fellow Survivors have done just that.
752,00:40:35.53,00:40:35.53,The three of you are still holding on.
753,00:40:38.60,00:40:38.60,"The question is, for how much longer?"
754,00:40:42.00,00:40:42.00,That's right.
755,00:40:43.07,00:40:43.07,Today's challenge is simple.
756,00:40:44.60,00:40:44.60,Don't let the money slip through your fingers.
757,00:40:46.70,00:40:46.70,"There are 18 coins in front of you, six for each of you,"
758,00:40:50.43,00:40:50.43,"three for your left hand, three for your right."
759,00:40:52.47,00:40:52.47, You'll put the coins  between your fingers
760,00:40:54.87,00:40:54.87, and keep them there.  You will then
761,00:40:57.00,00:40:57.00,"go into a traditional Thai stance called the khon,"
762,00:41:00.50,00:41:00.50,and you will stand in this position with the coins
763,00:41:03.73,00:41:03.73,between your fingers for the duration
764,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50, of the challenge.
765,00:41:07.50,00:41:07.50, The frames behind you will  force you to stay in place.
766,00:41:10.37,00:41:10.37, It will be uncomfortable.
767,00:41:11.67,00:41:11.67,"It will grow to be painful, especially for your legs."
768,00:41:15.90,00:41:15.90,You will want to quit.
769,00:41:17.37,00:41:17.37,It's a test of your willpower.
770,00:41:19.30,00:41:19.30,"And the longer you last, the more difficult"
771,00:41:21.50,00:41:21.50,it becomes to achieve your goal.
772,00:41:23.33,00:41:23.33,"Slowly, those coins will begin"
773,00:41:25.33,00:41:25.33, to fall through your fingers.
774,00:41:27.40,00:41:27.40,When all six of your coins have fallen through your fingers
775,00:41:31.17,00:41:31.17," into the wok below,"
776,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,you're out of the game.
777,00:41:34.60,00:41:34.60,Last person left standing wins immunity--
778,00:41:37.73,00:41:37.73,guaranteed a spot in the final two--
779,00:41:39.77,00:41:39.77,"and with that immunity,"
780,00:41:41.47,00:41:41.47,gets to decide who comes with them to that final vote.
781,00:41:45.40,00:41:45.40,Stakes have never been bigger.
782,00:41:47.40,00:41:47.40,Concentration needs to be keen.
783,00:41:48.90,00:41:48.90,Block out everything else.
784,00:41:50.50,00:41:50.50,I'm gonna ask you now to come forward one at a time
785,00:41:52.67,00:41:52.67,and grab six coins.
786,00:41:53.77,00:41:53.77,"Jan, you first."
787,00:41:55.00,00:41:55.00,Keep them in your palms. Brian.
788,00:41:58.73,00:41:58.73,Clay.
789,00:42:00.63,00:42:00.63,Now I'm going to ask you guys to take off your shoes.
790,00:42:05.30,00:42:05.30,I'm going to ask you to take your coins
791,00:42:06.83,00:42:06.83,"and put them between your fingers, three on each hand."
792,00:42:10.17,00:42:10.17,Center them up.
793,00:42:12.53,00:42:12.53,I want you to step up onto your platform.
794,00:42:15.23,00:42:15.23,"Put your head, your hands and your feet"
795,00:42:17.70,00:42:17.70,"in the brackets, palms facing up."
796,00:42:28.63,00:42:28.63,"Guys, for the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
797,00:42:32.87,00:42:32.87,Challenge is on.
798,00:42:52.33,00:42:52.33,There'll be some initial discomfort.
799,00:42:55.47,00:42:55.47,It'll turn into pain.
800,00:42:57.27,00:42:57.27,"But if you use your mind right, you'll block it out."
801,00:43:00.33,00:43:00.33,"Get into a good zone, you'll be all right."
802,00:43:09.07,00:43:09.07,"Jan, what do you reckon's"
803,00:43:10.87,00:43:10.87,the first thing you're going to do when you get home?
804,00:43:13.40,00:43:13.40,"First thing I get away from here, I'm having four beers--"
805,00:43:15.67,00:43:15.67,"two in each hand-- and a big, fat pizza."
806,00:43:17.63,00:43:17.63,"That's exactly what I'm going to do,"
807,00:43:19.43,00:43:19.43,and try and find some sucker with a cigar
808,00:43:21.63,00:43:21.63,"and con it off of him,"
809,00:43:23.80,00:43:23.80,and then laugh.
810,00:43:26.90,00:43:26.90,"PROBST: Brian, what are you thinking right now?"
811,00:43:29.00,00:43:29.00,I'm just relaxing.
812,00:43:30.37,00:43:30.37,-All right. -Thank you.
813,00:43:31.80,00:43:31.80,"Clay, what are you going to do when you get out of here?"
814,00:43:33.67,00:43:33.67,What's the first action you're going to take when you get home?
815,00:43:35.63,00:43:35.63,Get something fattening and hug the hell out of my wife.
816,00:43:38.47,00:43:38.47,She's supposed to have a pie waiting in the car for me.
817,00:43:55.43,00:43:55.43,You guys are doing great.
818,00:44:08.47,00:44:08.47,This is the point where it starts to get
819,00:44:10.23,00:44:10.23,a little painful. Work through it.
820,00:44:25.63,00:44:25.63,"Stay focused on your own game, guys."
821,00:44:45.47,00:44:45.47,It is designed to hurt.
822,00:44:47.33,00:44:47.33,It's designed to test your willpower.
823,00:44:49.73,00:44:49.73,You're at the hardest part right now.
824,00:44:53.90,00:44:53.90,You are in the darkest part of this challenge.
825,00:45:03.07,00:45:03.07,You guys have come way too far to give in now.
826,00:45:09.47,00:45:09.47,"Remember, guys, it's also important to stay in your game"
827,00:45:13.00,00:45:13.00,mentally in relation to the other players.
828,00:45:16.40,00:45:16.40,The image you put forth
829,00:45:17.87,00:45:17.87,affects them-- gives them power or takes it away.
830,00:45:31.63,00:45:31.63,I can't. I can't.
831,00:45:33.43,00:45:33.43,I'm sorry. I can't.
832,00:45:36.13,00:45:36.13,I can't. That was me.
833,00:45:46.67,00:45:46.67,"Sit down, guys. Have a seat."
834,00:45:48.27,00:45:48.27,"-Stretch it out. -Way to go, Brian."
835,00:45:49.57,00:45:49.57,Time to... time to get out.
836,00:45:50.67,00:45:50.67,-Okay. Everyone gone? -Yeah.
837,00:45:53.23,00:45:53.23,"PROBST: It's yours, Brian."
838,00:46:01.70,00:46:01.70,"Good job, guys."
839,00:46:03.03,00:46:03.03,"CLAY: Way to go, Jan."
840,00:46:04.53,00:46:04.53,You gave it all you got.
841,00:46:06.13,00:46:06.13,Way to go.
842,00:46:09.50,00:46:09.50,"For the third time in a row, take it."
843,00:46:16.77,00:46:16.77,-CLAY: Feel good? -Yeah. Thanks.
844,00:46:18.77,00:46:18.77,"PROBST: All right, guys, here's where we're at."
845,00:46:21.37,00:46:21.37,"For the third time, Brian has immunity"
846,00:46:23.13,00:46:23.13,and a very big decision to make:
847,00:46:25.53,00:46:25.53,which one of you two to take with him to the final vote.
848,00:46:29.30,00:46:29.30,That's what you have to think about today.
849,00:46:31.10,00:46:31.10,I will see the three of you tonight at Tribal Council.
850,00:46:34.03,00:46:34.03,Take your torches.
851,00:46:35.70,00:46:35.70,Make your way back to camp.
852,00:47:16.23,00:47:16.23,What a morning.
853,00:47:17.77,00:47:17.77,"You guys, are your legs still like rubber?"
854,00:47:19.80,00:47:19.80,CLAY: Still really hurt.
855,00:47:21.43,00:47:21.43,"JAN: Today, walking  into the last challenge,"
856,00:47:24.33,00:47:24.33," I knew I had to beat Brian  and Clay, but my legs"
857,00:47:27.70,00:47:27.70,"were just quivering like that, and I had sweat coming down,"
858,00:47:30.60,00:47:30.60,"and, uh... um, I just couldn't take myself to that next level."
859,00:47:40.83,00:47:40.83,BRIAN: Wow. What a dramatic challenge.
860,00:47:43.57,00:47:43.57,(thunder crashes)
861,00:47:47.20,00:47:47.20,That's what I felt like. That's just what I felt like.
862,00:47:49.93,00:47:49.93,That's... my whole body felt like lightning going through it.
863,00:47:56.73,00:47:56.73,There was a major burn going on  all throughout the legs.
864,00:47:58.93,00:47:58.93," Then it went to the butt,  the lower back and the neck."
865,00:48:01.80,00:48:01.80," But I made it through and, uh,"
866,00:48:03.73,00:48:03.73, took that immunity home  for the third time in a row.
867,00:48:17.07,00:48:17.07,CLAY: This is our final Tribal  Council before there's two
868,00:48:20.17,00:48:20.17, that's going to have to sit  before the jury.
869,00:48:22.13,00:48:22.13, I feel very confident  that Brian's gonna go in
870,00:48:24.30,00:48:24.30, and set Jan on the jury  as the seventh member
871,00:48:27.30,00:48:27.30," and I'm going to set  up there as, uh,"
872,00:48:29.63,00:48:29.63,one-two and let the jury vote on us
873,00:48:31.57,00:48:31.57,"and, uh, see who gets the million."
874,00:48:38.63,00:48:38.63,BRIAN: I'm thinking  about the whole picture.
875,00:48:40.50,00:48:40.50, Simple as that.
876,00:48:41.80,00:48:41.80," I-I know it's  a $900,000 mistake"
877,00:48:45.13,00:48:45.13,"I could be making, but there's a lot... a lot here at stake."
878,00:48:48.90,00:48:48.90, Putting me up against
879,00:48:50.50,00:48:50.50," a 53-year-old lady  that's done not much,"
880,00:48:53.00,00:48:53.00, yet she hasn't done anything  to step on anybody's feet.
881,00:48:56.57,00:48:56.57," Clay's played the game very  similar to me, so I'm not sure"
882,00:48:59.53,00:48:59.53,of how the votes are going to go; I really don't know.
883,00:49:04.43,00:49:04.43,Get your little rod.
884,00:49:07.43,00:49:07.43,CLAY: The only reason  I can think Brian
885,00:49:09.73,00:49:09.73, taking Jan to the final two--  it'd be an easier win.
886,00:49:12.37,00:49:12.37, He-he may walk up there  and just
887,00:49:14.20,00:49:14.20,blow me right out of the water.
888,00:49:15.70,00:49:15.70,"I mean, we... me and him have blown two out of the water"
889,00:49:17.87,00:49:17.87,in the last two Tribal Councils  that just absolutely thought
890,00:49:20.37,00:49:20.37," no way that they  were fixing to leave,"
891,00:49:21.90,00:49:21.90,and we sent them home.
892,00:49:23.73,00:49:23.73,"And he may be doing it to me, but, uh, I'll have to see it."
893,00:49:26.60,00:49:26.60, I don't believe it.
894,00:49:57.97,00:49:57.97,We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
895,00:50:00.90,00:50:00.90,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake,"
896,00:50:03.60,00:50:03.60,"our newest member, Helen, and Big Ted."
897,00:50:07.97,00:50:07.97,So let's talk about today.
898,00:50:10.10,00:50:10.10,I have to imagine it was
899,00:50:12.00,00:50:12.00,a pretty emotional day for you guys.
900,00:50:13.77,00:50:13.77,"-Jan? -Yes, it was very emotional."
901,00:50:16.70,00:50:16.70,And it started really the night before.
902,00:50:19.07,00:50:19.07,We had to make the floats for everyone
903,00:50:21.87,00:50:21.87,"and take them and let them go and, uh, remember who we'd met,"
904,00:50:26.37,00:50:26.37,"and, uh, it was... it was very bittersweet."
905,00:50:29.93,00:50:29.93,Any one memory in particular stand out?
906,00:50:32.27,00:50:32.27,"Uh, of the floats?"
907,00:50:34.07,00:50:34.07,"Uh, yes."
908,00:50:35.97,00:50:35.97,"The one, uh... was most was Helen,"
909,00:50:38.33,00:50:38.33,'cause we put spoons on the top of it for her 'cause she cooked.
910,00:50:42.97,00:50:42.97,It was very emotional for me.
911,00:50:45.47,00:50:45.47,"And when I let her go, I said,"
912,00:50:47.47,00:50:47.47,"""You know, you're not a Survivor friend."
913,00:50:49.57,00:50:49.57,"You're a friend for life."""
914,00:50:51.80,00:50:51.80,"PROBST: Clay, how was it for you today?"
915,00:50:54.17,00:50:54.17,"Really, I turned each one of them loose,"
916,00:50:56.53,00:50:56.53,and every one of them meant something.
917,00:50:58.30,00:50:58.30,"You know, here we are from all-all over..."
918,00:51:00.53,00:51:00.53,"all across the United States, and, uh, we're all Americans,"
919,00:51:03.50,00:51:03.50,but yet we live so different.
920,00:51:05.87,00:51:05.87,"We had a hell of a time, you know, every one of us."
921,00:51:09.00,00:51:09.00,"-It was neat. -PROBST: Well, Brian,"
922,00:51:10.97,00:51:10.97,"for the third Tribal Council in a row,"
923,00:51:13.40,00:51:13.40,you have immunity.
924,00:51:14.87,00:51:14.87,"Really big vote tonight,"
925,00:51:17.03,00:51:17.03,"because not only are you voting somebody out,"
926,00:51:19.57,00:51:19.57,you're also keeping somebody.
927,00:51:20.93,00:51:20.93,"Strategically, it's huge."
928,00:51:23.13,00:51:23.13,How many times today have you thought
929,00:51:25.40,00:51:25.40,"about this in terms of a $900,000 decision?"
930,00:51:28.90,00:51:28.90,"Back and forth, it's like a tennis match in my head."
931,00:51:31.33,00:51:31.33,"Ping-Pong, tennis."
932,00:51:33.43,00:51:33.43,"(imitates sound of bouncing ball, chuckles)"
933,00:51:34.97,00:51:34.97,This is where you've got to control those emotions
934,00:51:38.50,00:51:38.50,"and you've got to look, uh, tactical"
935,00:51:40.53,00:51:40.53,"as well as, uh, business decisions."
936,00:51:43.23,00:51:43.23,What's going to make sense?
937,00:51:44.60,00:51:44.60,"Uh, what's... what's fair?"
938,00:51:47.03,00:51:47.03,"So that's what I've been kind of, uh..."
939,00:51:50.33,00:51:50.33,"uh, teeter-tottering with, as I like to say."
940,00:51:52.53,00:51:52.53,"Okay, here's how the voting will work tonight."
941,00:51:54.80,00:51:54.80,"Jan, because you cannot vote for Brian"
942,00:51:57.13,00:51:57.13,"and you cannot vote for yourself,"
943,00:51:58.50,00:51:58.50,-you can only vote for Clay. -I know. Right.
944,00:52:00.30,00:52:00.30,"Clay, you can only vote for Jan."
945,00:52:02.17,00:52:02.17,Your two votes cancel each other out.
946,00:52:04.07,00:52:04.07,-No sense in you voting. -Right.
947,00:52:05.73,00:52:05.73,"Therefore, the only person that will vote tonight will be Brian."
948,00:52:08.90,00:52:08.90,"You'll cast one vote, and in doing so,"
949,00:52:11.20,00:52:11.20,"you will vote out the 14th member,"
950,00:52:13.33,00:52:13.33,"and more importantly, you will decide who is going with you"
951,00:52:16.33,00:52:16.33,to the final Tribal Council.
952,00:52:18.37,00:52:18.37,"Having said that, it is time to vote. Brian."
953,00:52:39.70,00:52:39.70,(sighs)
954,00:52:49.47,00:52:49.47,BRIAN:  You've come a long way.
955,00:52:51.27,00:52:51.27,"A long, long way."
956,00:52:53.23,00:52:53.23, Congratulations.
957,00:52:58.03,00:52:58.03,Been my pleasure.
958,00:53:15.17,00:53:15.17,I will go tally the vote.
959,00:53:37.93,00:53:37.93,"Once the vote has been read, the decision is final."
960,00:53:40.70,00:53:40.70,Person voted out will be asked to leave
961,00:53:42.40,00:53:42.40,the Tribal Council area immediately.
962,00:53:43.87,00:53:43.87,I'll read the vote.
963,00:53:51.47,00:53:51.47,The 14th person voted out of the tribe.
964,00:53:56.37,00:53:56.37,Jan. Need to bring me your torch.
965,00:54:08.17,00:54:08.17,"Jan, the tribe has spoken."
966,00:54:13.03,00:54:13.03,It's time for you to go.
967,00:54:17.40,00:54:17.40,I love y'all. Thanks.
968,00:54:18.53,00:54:18.53,"We love you, Jan."
969,00:54:19.70,00:54:19.70,-Good luck. -Good luck.
970,00:54:30.50,00:54:30.50,Thank you.
971,00:54:32.43,00:54:32.43,(whispers): You're welcome.
972,00:54:37.43,00:54:37.43,There's nothing left to be said.
973,00:54:38.83,00:54:38.83,You two have gone as far as you can go in this game.
974,00:54:42.43,00:54:42.43,You have one day left.
975,00:54:43.87,00:54:43.87,I will see you at the final Tribal Council.
976,00:54:46.37,00:54:46.37,Good night.
977,00:54:49.80,00:54:49.80,JAN: My experience on Survivor   has just been totally surreal.
978,00:54:54.20,00:54:54.20,I didn't know I could ever be here 38 days
979,00:54:56.97,00:54:56.97, in a bat cave  with rats and snakes.
980,00:54:59.87,00:54:59.87," If there's one thing  I've learned, it's:"
981,00:55:01.83,00:55:01.83, don't listen to the word  you can't do something.
982,00:55:04.70,00:55:04.70, Don't quit.  I'm a teacher.
983,00:55:06.50,00:55:06.50,I don't want any of my students to ever quit anything.
984,00:55:28.47,00:55:28.47,"CLAY:  I thought all day long,"
985,00:55:30.27,00:55:30.27,"""What would I do if I was in Brian's shoes?"""
986,00:55:34.77,00:55:34.77," You know, a million dollars  is a lot of money."
987,00:55:36.87,00:55:36.87," That could make a man  change his mind,"
988,00:55:38.63,00:55:38.63," but he stayed true, and, uh,  when he turned it over,"
989,00:55:40.80,00:55:40.80,"it said ""Jan,"" and, uh, I was a happy man."
990,00:55:43.90,00:55:43.90,Now we got a guy in his mid-30s and a guy in his mid-40s
991,00:55:48.00,00:55:48.00,"just kicked all them young people's ass, didn't we?"
992,00:55:50.20,00:55:50.20,"-Didn't we, though? -Thank you again, sir."
993,00:55:52.70,00:55:52.70,"BRIAN: Congratulations, sir."
994,00:55:53.90,00:55:53.90,"Congratulations to you, too."
995,00:55:55.30,00:55:55.30,"-We started with the preacher. -Oh, yeah."
996,00:55:56.77,00:55:56.77,"That's right. We did, didn't we?"
997,00:56:08.57,00:56:08.57,CLAY:  We got a boat that's just
998,00:56:10.10,00:56:10.10," the heaviest boat  I've ever saw in my life,"
999,00:56:12.27,00:56:12.27,and it has been a burden in our butt ever since we got here.
1000,00:56:22.30,00:56:22.30,BRIAN:  The burning of the boat
1001,00:56:23.77,00:56:23.77,was like a cleansing of the soul.
1002,00:56:25.73,00:56:25.73,It was a pain in the ass!
1003,00:56:27.87,00:56:27.87,"BRIAN: I wanted to get rid  of any sort of, uh..."
1004,00:56:30.47,00:56:30.47,uh... bad energy.
1005,00:56:33.70,00:56:33.70,"-CLAY: Bye, boat. No more water. -BRIAN: Bye, boat."
1006,00:56:36.03,00:56:36.03,No more problems.
1007,00:56:37.90,00:56:37.90,"(Clay yelling, Brian whooping)"
1008,00:56:40.57,00:56:40.57,"All right, we did it, daddy."
1009,00:56:42.20,00:56:42.20,-Congratulations. -Congratulations. Thank you.
1010,00:56:44.70,00:56:44.70,CLAY: We're finished... we're  finished with the water runs.
1011,00:56:46.63,00:56:46.63,We're finished paddling places.
1012,00:56:48.60,00:56:48.60,We're... we're finished gathering
1013,00:56:50.23,00:56:50.23, clams and crabs.
1014,00:56:51.57,00:56:51.57," It was, uh, nice to see it go."
1015,00:56:54.80,00:56:54.80,Wow. It's over.
1016,00:56:58.40,00:56:58.40,It's actually over.
1017,00:57:25.30,00:57:25.30,Knew that sun would come. Look at it peeking its ass up
1018,00:57:27.93,00:57:27.93,"-up on top of that deal. -Oh, yeah. Look at that thing. Wow."
1019,00:57:29.60,00:57:29.60,Look at that big old sun.
1020,00:57:37.33,00:57:37.33,"CLAY: 39, baby."
1021,00:57:38.63,00:57:38.63,-Ooh! -Whoo!
1022,00:57:40.33,00:57:40.33,Last day.
1023,00:57:43.60,00:57:43.60,"Uh-huh. Oh, yeah."
1024,00:57:45.33,00:57:45.33,Wow.
1025,00:57:47.37,00:57:47.37,What a beautiful sight.
1026,00:57:49.67,00:57:49.67,The last coconut.
1027,00:57:52.00,00:57:52.00,"You know what? It doesn't have dirt all over it, either."
1028,00:57:54.30,00:57:54.30,-Look at that. -Mm-hmm.
1029,00:57:55.70,00:57:55.70,CLAY: Day 39 is the most  memorable time of my life.
1030,00:57:58.83,00:57:58.83,I would not change anything I've done...
1031,00:58:02.37,00:58:02.37, any experience I've had  in the last 39 days.
1032,00:58:06.50,00:58:06.50,My gosh.
1033,00:58:07.87,00:58:07.87,BRIAN: We're literally down  to hours now.
1034,00:58:09.27,00:58:09.27, This isn't days.  This isn't weeks.
1035,00:58:11.40,00:58:11.40, We are down to hours.
1036,00:58:13.17,00:58:13.17,Okay.
1037,00:58:14.67,00:58:14.67,"Excellent job, sir."
1038,00:58:16.23,00:58:16.23,Thank you.
1039,00:58:18.80,00:58:18.80,"Good job to you, too."
1040,00:58:20.33,00:58:20.33,Appreciate that.
1041,00:58:41.27,00:58:41.27,"CLAY: If you look at  the whole game, each one of us"
1042,00:58:44.10,00:58:44.10, had to do something  for the other one to survive.
1043,00:58:47.70,00:58:47.70," So somewhere in there,  all 16 people"
1044,00:58:50.80,00:58:50.80, ended up having to help the  other one live on this island.
1045,00:58:53.90,00:58:53.90,"We suffered a hell of a lot,"
1046,00:58:55.37,00:58:55.37,"but when you're looking back on it,"
1047,00:58:57.37,00:58:57.37,"wow, what a memorable event."
1048,00:58:59.83,00:58:59.83,"That's it, Clay."
1049,00:59:01.40,00:59:01.40,-We're out of here. -We are out of here.
1050,00:59:05.63,00:59:05.63,BRIAN:  We both had fun.
1051,00:59:07.03,00:59:07.03, We both brought meaning  into this.
1052,00:59:09.23,00:59:09.23," We're now sitting  in the, uh, winner's circle."
1053,00:59:11.50,00:59:11.50," You can't get any higher  in this game,"
1054,00:59:13.37,00:59:13.37,and it's now up to a jury to decide our fate.
1055,00:59:23.37,00:59:23.37," Yeah, this is strictly  a game to me."
1056,00:59:25.90,00:59:25.90, It's about building  relationships
1057,00:59:27.77,00:59:27.77, and cutting your losses
1058,00:59:30.00,00:59:30.00," to move onto the next level,  to get to a certain position."
1059,00:59:33.67,00:59:33.67,But the relationships that you built
1060,00:59:35.23,00:59:35.23,weren't necessarily real.
1061,00:59:40.27,00:59:40.27, That's a sad fact of reality--
1062,00:59:41.77,00:59:41.77, that this game  is a little brutal.
1063,00:59:44.73,00:59:44.73,This game is dangerous.
1064,00:59:46.37,00:59:46.37,"If you don't have strong skin, you're going to be done quick."
1065,00:59:52.00,00:59:52.00,"Just over the last couple days,"
1066,00:59:53.60,00:59:53.60," things have gotten  pretty, uh, touch and go,"
1067,00:59:55.73,00:59:55.73, and there might have been  some opinions formed
1068,00:59:57.63,00:59:57.63, in how cutthroat I am.
1069,00:59:59.63,00:59:59.63,It's a little scary to be sitting up there
1070,01:00:01.53,01:00:01.53,"with the spotlight on you, interrogated."
1071,01:00:10.93,01:00:10.93,CLAY:  Everybody respects Brian.
1072,01:00:12.67,01:00:12.67, He's a class act.
1073,01:00:13.93,01:00:13.93," But, uh, Ted and Helen  felt like they had"
1074,01:00:15.93,01:00:15.93," a pretty solid base  with old Brian,"
1075,01:00:18.23,01:00:18.23," and, uh, they may feel  more betrayed by him than me."
1076,01:00:26.50,01:00:26.50, I'm sure all 16 of us  come out there
1077,01:00:28.97,01:00:28.97, definitely not wanting to be  the first one kicked off.
1078,01:00:31.73,01:00:31.73,"Well, somebody had to be the first one kicked off,"
1079,01:00:33.63,01:00:33.63,and somebody's got to win the million.
1080,01:00:35.33,01:00:35.33, It's just all the stuff  in between these two people
1081,01:00:37.17,01:00:37.17, that i-is the problem.
1082,01:00:38.80,01:00:38.80, I wish all of us here
1083,01:00:40.17,01:00:40.17," could get a million dollars,  but we can't."
1084,01:00:42.17,01:00:42.17, It ends up with one person--  one lone Survivor--
1085,01:00:44.40,01:00:44.40,"and, uh, I still got one more to beat."
1086,01:01:17.30,01:01:17.30,We'll now bring in our full jury of seven members.
1087,01:01:22.80,01:01:22.80,"Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake, Helen,"
1088,01:01:28.53,01:01:28.53,"Ted and our newest member, Jan."
1089,01:01:38.67,01:01:38.67,Welcome to your final Tribal Council.
1090,01:01:40.80,01:01:40.80,Let me start by saying congratulations.
1091,01:01:43.00,01:01:43.00,Thank you.
1092,01:01:44.23,01:01:44.23,It's a little bit different tonight.
1093,01:01:45.57,01:01:45.57,"In the past, the power of the vote"
1094,01:01:47.33,01:01:47.33,resided on this side of the flame.
1095,01:01:50.40,01:01:50.40,"Tonight, that shifts"
1096,01:01:52.40,01:01:52.40,"to the other side of the fire, to our jury."
1097,01:01:54.53,01:01:54.53,Seven people that either directly or indirectly
1098,01:01:56.77,01:01:56.77,you had a hand in voting out of this game
1099,01:01:59.87,01:01:59.87,now have your fate entirely in their hands.
1100,01:02:03.17,01:02:03.17,"Tonight, they'll be voting for a sole Survivor."
1101,01:02:05.73,01:02:05.73,"We'll begin with opening statements by the two of you,"
1102,01:02:08.83,01:02:08.83,why you deserve to win this game.
1103,01:02:10.83,01:02:10.83,The jury will then get a chance to address
1104,01:02:13.53,01:02:13.53,each of you individually and ask you a question.
1105,01:02:16.07,01:02:16.07,They're looking for information
1106,01:02:17.63,01:02:17.63,to help them make a big decision.
1107,01:02:19.37,01:02:19.37,And then we vote.
1108,01:02:20.87,01:02:20.87,Let's start with our opening statements. Clay.
1109,01:02:23.80,01:02:23.80,"Wow. What do I say besides, uh, I'm a lucky guy?"
1110,01:02:28.50,01:02:28.50,"I'm, uh, sitting here, and I'm not sitting over there."
1111,01:02:31.73,01:02:31.73,"The-the-the hard part of this game is,"
1112,01:02:33.60,01:02:33.60,"uh, we're people-- we're not pieces of a puzzle--"
1113,01:02:36.37,01:02:36.37,"and, uh, somewhere in there,"
1114,01:02:38.10,01:02:38.10,I had to tell some untruths and put y'all over there.
1115,01:02:41.17,01:02:41.17,"And I can promise you this, uh,"
1116,01:02:44.17,01:02:44.17,"if y'all could replace my seat here,"
1117,01:02:46.37,01:02:46.37,y'all would do exactly like I did.
1118,01:02:48.30,01:02:48.30,"Everybody came to play the hardest they can,"
1119,01:02:51.60,01:02:51.60,"and I did, too, and I'm sitting over here."
1120,01:02:53.37,01:02:53.37,"Th-this is a hard, uh... uh, thing to say."
1121,01:02:56.97,01:02:56.97,"Yes, I want the million."
1122,01:02:58.60,01:02:58.60,Million dollars at age 46 would mean...
1123,01:03:01.83,01:03:01.83,"definitely a life-changing, uh, deal, you know."
1124,01:03:04.23,01:03:04.23,"Everybody goes through bad luck, and, uh,"
1125,01:03:06.60,01:03:06.60,"unfortunately, I'm just coming out of some..."
1126,01:03:08.63,01:03:08.63,"a little bad luck and, uh, starting on my road up again."
1127,01:03:11.80,01:03:11.80,"And what a jump, what a boost that would give me."
1128,01:03:14.47,01:03:14.47,"It's up to y'all, and, uh,"
1129,01:03:16.67,01:03:16.67,"I know it's a super hard decision,"
1130,01:03:18.53,01:03:18.53,"because regardless of what y'all make,"
1131,01:03:20.53,01:03:20.53,y'all had to live with both of us for a while.
1132,01:03:23.53,01:03:23.53,Good luck.
1133,01:03:25.30,01:03:25.30,Brian.
1134,01:03:27.97,01:03:27.97,"Well, uh, first of all, I just want to say it's been"
1135,01:03:30.87,01:03:30.87,"a pleasure, uh, knowing each and every one of you"
1136,01:03:32.60,01:03:32.60,"through these, uh, days that we've had to know each other."
1137,01:03:36.53,01:03:36.53,"Uh, we've all had positive experiences,"
1138,01:03:38.97,01:03:38.97,and we've all had some bad experiences.
1139,01:03:41.27,01:03:41.27,And I think that there's been
1140,01:03:43.10,01:03:43.10,"some form of leadership through example,"
1141,01:03:46.90,01:03:46.90,leadership through merits.
1142,01:03:48.70,01:03:48.70,There's been no complaints on my part.
1143,01:03:50.93,01:03:50.93,"There's been no stories fabricated for, uh, sympathy."
1144,01:03:54.17,01:03:54.17,"There's been just a positive outlook, I think, every day"
1145,01:03:56.97,01:03:56.97,on a... on a daily basis.
1146,01:03:58.53,01:03:58.53,"But, uh, you know my focus--"
1147,01:04:00.37,01:04:00.37,"my focus was making sure everything was okay,"
1148,01:04:02.03,01:04:02.03,"uh, making sure we all had, uh, food in our bellies,"
1149,01:04:05.17,01:04:05.17,making sure we were all warm at night.
1150,01:04:06.70,01:04:06.70,"Um, along the way, uh, you develop some friends, but this"
1151,01:04:09.80,01:04:09.80,"is a game, and there were certain people that had to go,"
1152,01:04:12.10,01:04:12.10,"uh, before others, and that's what sucked."
1153,01:04:13.90,01:04:13.90,"Uh, but I dealt with it the best way I could,"
1154,01:04:15.97,01:04:15.97,sometimes by not saying anything.
1155,01:04:17.57,01:04:17.57,"So, uh, vote from your hearts, and, um,"
1156,01:04:20.70,01:04:20.70,look at the whole time that we've either known each other
1157,01:04:23.10,01:04:23.10,"and, uh... and feel good about it."
1158,01:04:24.60,01:04:24.60,"That's all I'm asking for, is you guys feel good"
1159,01:04:26.40,01:04:26.40,"about whatever you're going to do, and, uh..."
1160,01:04:27.83,01:04:27.83,"uh, I respect every one of you in your own way,"
1161,01:04:30.20,01:04:30.20,"and it's been, uh... a pleasure knowing you all."
1162,01:04:32.93,01:04:32.93,I appreciate it. Thank you.
1163,01:04:35.00,01:04:35.00,"Okay, jury, had a chance to hear what Clay and Brian had to say."
1164,01:04:40.33,01:04:40.33,"In a moment, you're going to get a chance to ask them a question"
1165,01:04:43.33,01:04:43.33,that will give you information you need
1166,01:04:45.10,01:04:45.10,to decide who will be the sole Survivor.
1167,01:04:48.37,01:04:48.37,I'll give you a moment to think about that.
1168,01:05:10.13,01:05:10.13,"PROBST: Okay, jury."
1169,01:05:11.13,01:05:11.13,Had a chance to hear what Clay and Brian had to say.
1170,01:05:13.73,01:05:13.73,It's now your chance to address them.
1171,01:05:15.83,01:05:15.83,This is your opportunity to ask a question from them
1172,01:05:19.43,01:05:19.43,to give you the information you need
1173,01:05:20.93,01:05:20.93,to make a very big decision.
1174,01:05:22.37,01:05:22.37,"Erin, we'll start with you."
1175,01:05:26.23,01:05:26.23,"-Hi, guys. -Hello. -(whispers): Hi."
1176,01:05:28.37,01:05:28.37,"Um, I've sat and listened"
1177,01:05:30.33,01:05:30.33,through every single Tribal Council.
1178,01:05:32.20,01:05:32.20,"Now, we've already heard why you think you deserve"
1179,01:05:35.40,01:05:35.40,the million dollars.
1180,01:05:36.80,01:05:36.80,Now I want to know
1181,01:05:38.43,01:05:38.43,why each of you think the person sitting next to you
1182,01:05:41.67,01:05:41.67,does not deserve the million dollars.
1183,01:05:44.27,01:05:44.27,I think we'll start with Brian.
1184,01:05:45.73,01:05:45.73,I think Clay does not deserve the million
1185,01:05:49.63,01:05:49.63,"because over a period of, say, 39 days"
1186,01:05:52.23,01:05:52.23,he did not put forth the effort that he could have.
1187,01:05:55.60,01:05:55.60,There's a lot more spunk in this little man
1188,01:05:58.07,01:05:58.07,"than I think we've seen,"
1189,01:05:59.80,01:05:59.80,"and, uh, I think he coasted through a few, uh, scenarios."
1190,01:06:04.00,01:06:04.00,He was more of a thinker
1191,01:06:05.23,01:06:05.23,whereas I was more of a... of a doer.
1192,01:06:07.23,01:06:07.23,Clay?
1193,01:06:09.00,01:06:09.00,"Uh, he, uh... he thought he was the leader"
1194,01:06:10.43,01:06:10.43,"of the camp, and, uh,"
1195,01:06:11.97,01:06:11.97,"there was times that he thought everybody should come to him,"
1196,01:06:14.63,01:06:14.63,"and, uh, they didn't always have to come talk to Brian."
1197,01:06:16.90,01:06:16.90,"You know, there's other tribe members they could go"
1198,01:06:18.80,01:06:18.80,"discuss, uh, things with without, uh,"
1199,01:06:21.67,01:06:21.67,him getting defensive or trying to worry
1200,01:06:23.20,01:06:23.20,about what they're talking about.
1201,01:06:25.07,01:06:25.07,"If, uh, he had so much power in camp,"
1202,01:06:27.17,01:06:27.17,"uh, he wouldn't have had to worry about that."
1203,01:06:29.33,01:06:29.33,-Okay. -PROBST: Satisfied?
1204,01:06:30.77,01:06:30.77,Satisfied.
1205,01:06:31.97,01:06:31.97,"Thanks, Erin."
1206,01:06:33.77,01:06:33.77,Ken.
1207,01:06:34.87,01:06:34.87,"-Hey. How you guys doing? -CLAY: Hey, guy."
1208,01:06:36.70,01:06:36.70,"-Okay. -Clay, you said that, um,"
1209,01:06:38.80,01:06:38.80,"there's not a person over here that would, uh..."
1210,01:06:40.67,01:06:40.67,that wouldn't do what you did to change places.
1211,01:06:43.20,01:06:43.20,"Well, you're wrong. I wouldn't do it, okay?"
1212,01:06:45.57,01:06:45.57,"I was straightforward to everybody,"
1213,01:06:47.60,01:06:47.60,"I never lied, and I kept my integrity."
1214,01:06:50.17,01:06:50.17,"Okay, that's what I go home with,"
1215,01:06:51.40,01:06:51.40,'cause that's the only thing a man
1216,01:06:52.70,01:06:52.70,can go home with at the end of the night
1217,01:06:54.20,01:06:54.20,after everything's gone.
1218,01:06:55.20,01:06:55.20,Okay.
1219,01:06:56.47,01:06:56.47,"Brian, when we first arrived at Chuay Gahn,"
1220,01:06:59.23,01:06:59.23,"you told me that Ted had to go,"
1221,01:07:01.57,01:07:01.57,"that he'd never make it to the final two,"
1222,01:07:04.33,01:07:04.33,and there's a reason he wouldn't make it to the final two.
1223,01:07:06.63,01:07:06.63,So why don't you tell the jury why Ted had to go?
1224,01:07:09.93,01:07:09.93,I didn't ever mention Ted had to go.
1225,01:07:13.27,01:07:13.27,"KEN: Okay, le-let's... let's rewind again."
1226,01:07:14.67,01:07:14.67,"Remember, I know the answer to this-- you told me this--"
1227,01:07:17.60,01:07:17.60,so just tell the jury what you told me.
1228,01:07:20.13,01:07:20.13,Why was... why did Ted have to go?
1229,01:07:22.07,01:07:22.07,That's all I want to know.
1230,01:07:23.43,01:07:23.43,"Uh, Ted had to go because he had a problem, uh, uh,"
1231,01:07:26.27,01:07:26.27,forming together with a group.
1232,01:07:27.40,01:07:27.40,So there was a feeling of Ted
1233,01:07:28.83,01:07:28.83,"kind of breaking off, doing his own thing."
1234,01:07:30.93,01:07:30.93,"So that was the reason, I think--"
1235,01:07:33.23,01:07:33.23,"the lack of, uh... uh, gelling with the group."
1236,01:07:35.33,01:07:35.33,-Okay. -Simple as that.
1237,01:07:36.67,01:07:36.67,-I-I'm... -PROBST: Ken.
1238,01:07:37.77,01:07:37.77,"Ken, I just want to make sure I'm clear."
1239,01:07:39.07,01:07:39.07,Brian told you something.
1240,01:07:40.50,01:07:40.50,"KEN: Well, Brian just told me two different things,"
1241,01:07:42.70,01:07:42.70,which neither one of them are what he told me
1242,01:07:44.60,01:07:44.60,"when this was originally done here,"
1243,01:07:46.50,01:07:46.50,when we originally talked about it.
1244,01:07:47.87,01:07:47.87,There's no big deal here. I'm satisfied.
1245,01:07:49.20,01:07:49.20,-I'm not going to push him anymore. -PROBST: Okay.
1246,01:07:50.73,01:07:50.73,Did you get the honesty?
1247,01:07:52.07,01:07:52.07,"-No, I did not. -Okay."
1248,01:07:53.67,01:07:53.67,"-And you're satisfied? -I'm satisfied. I mean, that's"
1249,01:07:55.80,01:07:55.80,between him and... him and God.
1250,01:07:59.30,01:07:59.30,Penny.
1251,01:08:05.40,01:08:05.40,"When we came into this merger, um,"
1252,01:08:07.03,01:08:07.03,we obviously didn't have the numbers.
1253,01:08:08.40,01:08:08.40,"We were down, you know, five to three."
1254,01:08:11.50,01:08:11.50,But knowing that I was just a number
1255,01:08:13.30,01:08:13.30,"and I was eventually going to be voted off based on that,"
1256,01:08:16.10,01:08:16.10,I still took the time to get to know both of you.
1257,01:08:19.50,01:08:19.50,But did you really bother to get to know who I am?
1258,01:08:22.43,01:08:22.43,"-Okay. -Uh, for example, Brian,"
1259,01:08:25.03,01:08:25.03,do you know where I grew up?
1260,01:08:28.30,01:08:28.30,In Texas.
1261,01:08:30.67,01:08:30.67,-Do you know where in Texas? -Um...
1262,01:08:32.10,01:08:32.10,"I want to say, uh, Beaumont."
1263,01:08:35.13,01:08:35.13,"Somewhere in Beaumont, Texas."
1264,01:08:36.77,01:08:36.77,That would be Jan.
1265,01:08:38.33,01:08:38.33,Do I have any siblings?
1266,01:08:39.57,01:08:39.57,"And if I do, what are their names?"
1267,01:08:41.53,01:08:41.53,You've got... an older brother.
1268,01:08:45.83,01:08:45.83,Or an older sister.
1269,01:08:47.83,01:08:47.83,"No, I'm the oldest."
1270,01:08:49.47,01:08:49.47,You're the oldest. Okay.
1271,01:08:51.03,01:08:51.03,And I don't know their names.
1272,01:08:53.17,01:08:53.17,"Is there anything you want to add, Clay?"
1273,01:08:54.97,01:08:54.97,"Well, I know you are a huge, uh, Texas Tech Red Raider fan,"
1274,01:08:58.43,01:08:58.43,"and, uh, I'm real impressed that, uh, Colleen,"
1275,01:09:00.37,01:09:00.37,"your-your future sister-in-law, is planning your wedding."
1276,01:09:02.77,01:09:02.77,"When you was in high school, you made a huge decision,"
1277,01:09:05.87,01:09:05.87,"and, uh, you were living with your daddy"
1278,01:09:07.80,01:09:07.80,and went to living with your mother.
1279,01:09:09.60,01:09:09.60,You didn't get to spend all your childhood
1280,01:09:11.57,01:09:11.57,"with your sister, and, uh, you really do regret that,"
1281,01:09:14.90,01:09:14.90,"but y'all have got a... a real good relationship,"
1282,01:09:17.03,01:09:17.03,"uh, going now. I don't know what else"
1283,01:09:18.77,01:09:18.77,-to tell you. That... All right. -That's fine.
1284,01:09:20.53,01:09:20.53,I'm satisfied.
1285,01:09:21.57,01:09:21.57,-Thank you. -Thanks. Uh-huh.
1286,01:09:22.60,01:09:22.60,"-Good luck. -Thanks, Penny."
1287,01:09:23.67,01:09:23.67,Thank you.
1288,01:09:24.87,01:09:24.87,Jake.
1289,01:09:28.40,01:09:28.40,"Hi, guys."
1290,01:09:29.77,01:09:29.77,-Hey. -You're kind of in
1291,01:09:31.03,01:09:31.03,"the hot seat tonight, aren't you?"
1292,01:09:32.03,01:09:32.03,"Oh, I'm telling you."
1293,01:09:33.33,01:09:33.33,"I'm kind of glad, in a way, that I'm over"
1294,01:09:36.07,01:09:36.07,on this side of this fire and not on that side.
1295,01:09:38.83,01:09:38.83,"I also want to tell you that I don't know how you did it,"
1296,01:09:42.20,01:09:42.20,"but, boy, did y'all do a number on me"
1297,01:09:44.47,01:09:44.47,by taking a person who I had a strong alliance with
1298,01:09:49.37,01:09:49.37,"and getting her to vote against me, and that was Penny."
1299,01:09:52.50,01:09:52.50,Which I thought was just
1300,01:09:53.93,01:09:53.93,"a really clever, manipulative move."
1301,01:09:56.63,01:09:56.63,"Now, on that very night, Jeff asked,"
1302,01:10:00.23,01:10:00.23,"""Does anybody feel like they might get voted out?"""
1303,01:10:03.00,01:10:03.00,"And I said, ""Yeah, I-I feel pretty vulnerable tonight."
1304,01:10:05.10,01:10:05.10,"""I'm just excited the fact that Brian stated"
1305,01:10:08.83,01:10:08.83,"""that the vote is going to be on performance,"
1306,01:10:12.00,01:10:12.00,"""because let me tell you,"
1307,01:10:14.37,01:10:14.37,"""I do know that I perform as good as anybody out there"
1308,01:10:18.80,01:10:18.80,"and probably better than most."""
1309,01:10:20.57,01:10:20.57,"Now, we had just gotten back to camp, and, Clay,"
1310,01:10:23.47,01:10:23.47,you really blasted me about the fact that I'm next.
1311,01:10:28.97,01:10:28.97,My question is this.
1312,01:10:31.20,01:10:31.20,"Why did you feel threatened for what I had said,"
1313,01:10:33.83,01:10:33.83,which was only the same repeated what Brian said?
1314,01:10:36.70,01:10:36.70,CLAY: The reason that it upset me--
1315,01:10:38.13,01:10:38.13,"because when you come to camp, within, uh, 15 minutes,"
1316,01:10:42.10,01:10:42.10,you started trying to make an alliance with me.
1317,01:10:44.20,01:10:44.20,Then you're trying to make an alliance to Ted.
1318,01:10:46.43,01:10:46.43,"Then come out, you're talking to Brian,"
1319,01:10:48.07,01:10:48.07,trying to make another one with him.
1320,01:10:49.93,01:10:49.93,"You was trying to play me with all of my own tribe members,"
1321,01:10:53.20,01:10:53.20,and you didn't think we wasn't going to talk?
1322,01:10:55.33,01:10:55.33,You were wrong.
1323,01:10:56.93,01:10:56.93,All right.
1324,01:10:58.60,01:10:58.60,"Now, Brian, how did you feel at that point?"
1325,01:11:01.53,01:11:01.53,I was working hand in hand with you.
1326,01:11:04.77,01:11:04.77,"You were out there clamming with me, getting food."
1327,01:11:07.20,01:11:07.20,"No, at the time, I did not feel the same way,"
1328,01:11:09.60,01:11:09.60,to answer your question.
1329,01:11:12.10,01:11:12.10,-Satisfied? -Satisfied.
1330,01:11:14.07,01:11:14.07,"Thanks, Jake."
1331,01:11:15.63,01:11:15.63,Ted.
1332,01:11:18.87,01:11:18.87,"First to you, Brian."
1333,01:11:20.47,01:11:20.47,"Brian, um, you know, the way you played this game,"
1334,01:11:22.87,01:11:22.87,"you truly are a great, great car salesman."
1335,01:11:25.90,01:11:25.90,You sold me your friendship.
1336,01:11:27.90,01:11:27.90,You sold me your understanding of... of cultural diversity.
1337,01:11:31.40,01:11:31.40,"And most of all, you sold me your word,"
1338,01:11:33.40,01:11:33.40,all to find out that each one of those qualities were lemons.
1339,01:11:36.67,01:11:36.67,"Clay, you, on the other hand... I mean, you sit there"
1340,01:11:40.97,01:11:40.97,only because you rode the coattail of Brian.
1341,01:11:43.60,01:11:43.60,"I really, really, really did overestimate you."
1342,01:11:47.23,01:11:47.23,You're nothing more than an ignorant
1343,01:11:48.97,01:11:48.97,Southern redneck hillbilly.
1344,01:11:51.73,01:11:51.73,That's fine.
1345,01:11:53.23,01:11:53.23,"My question to you is,"
1346,01:11:54.70,01:11:54.70,how do you define a racist person?
1347,01:11:57.53,01:11:57.53,I don't know of a racist remark I-I-I said.
1348,01:12:01.87,01:12:01.87,"So you're basically telling me, behind my back,"
1349,01:12:05.07,01:12:05.07,you've never made any racist comments?
1350,01:12:08.97,01:12:08.97,-About you? No. -About me.
1351,01:12:11.30,01:12:11.30,"I-I didn't. If I did, I sure didn't mean to."
1352,01:12:13.50,01:12:13.50,TED: Okay. So...
1353,01:12:15.40,01:12:15.40,what is Clay's definition of a racist person?
1354,01:12:19.57,01:12:19.57,"-I think... Okay. -""Well, my definition"
1355,01:12:21.00,01:12:21.00,"-of a racist person is... this."" -I think that..."
1356,01:12:22.17,01:12:22.17,"Ted, I think a racist person"
1357,01:12:23.50,01:12:23.50,"that tries to belittle the other race,"
1358,01:12:25.97,01:12:25.97,"whether it's white, black, brown, pink or purple, whatever."
1359,01:12:28.47,01:12:28.47,TED: Okay.
1360,01:12:29.97,01:12:29.97,Part two of this question: What can you say to convince me
1361,01:12:33.23,01:12:33.23,that you're worthy of my vote?
1362,01:12:35.57,01:12:35.57,"I was, uh, fair with Ted."
1363,01:12:38.67,01:12:38.67,You were fair with me?
1364,01:12:39.87,01:12:39.87,Yeah.
1365,01:12:40.97,01:12:40.97,-100% fair with me? -Mm-hmm.
1366,01:12:42.67,01:12:42.67,"Brian, is that true?"
1367,01:12:44.97,01:12:44.97,No.
1368,01:12:46.57,01:12:46.57,-Okay. -I have... I don't have anything else.
1369,01:12:48.77,01:12:48.77,-Okay. -That's it.
1370,01:12:50.47,01:12:50.47,"Thank you, Jeff."
1371,01:12:52.37,01:12:52.37,"-Thanks, Ted. -Mm-hmm."
1372,01:12:53.50,01:12:53.50,PROBST: Jan.
1373,01:12:55.10,01:12:55.10,JAN: Okay.
1374,01:12:58.13,01:12:58.13,"Hi, guys."
1375,01:12:59.20,01:12:59.20,-Hey. -38 days
1376,01:13:01.03,01:13:01.03,"I was with y'all, morning, noon and night."
1377,01:13:03.80,01:13:03.80,"Um, Clay, I know you think you worked very, very hard."
1378,01:13:07.73,01:13:07.73,"In comparing everything, I want you to, uh, explain to me"
1379,01:13:11.47,01:13:11.47,that you worked harder than Brian
1380,01:13:14.60,01:13:14.60,"in the total work of the water and the food,"
1381,01:13:18.37,01:13:18.37,and making the tribe live and survive on day-to-day.
1382,01:13:21.50,01:13:21.50,"As far as getting food, yes, I-I-I very well did my share."
1383,01:13:24.77,01:13:24.77,"As far as swimming and getting the water,"
1384,01:13:26.27,01:13:26.27,he did swim a whole lot more than I did to go get the water.
1385,01:13:29.07,01:13:29.07,"And, uh, I asked him, I said, ""Brian, I'll go."""
1386,01:13:31.00,01:13:31.00,"He said, ""No, you... you got other things."" And, uh,"
1387,01:13:33.63,01:13:33.63,"I said, ""If you... when you-you want me to go, I'm ready to go."""
1388,01:13:37.03,01:13:37.03,"And he said, ""No, I got it,"" and, uh,"
1389,01:13:38.67,01:13:38.67,-so I stayed at the house. -Okay.
1390,01:13:40.80,01:13:40.80,"Now, Brian, will you defend, uh,"
1391,01:13:43.03,01:13:43.03,"your comparison of the workload as compared to Clay, please?"
1392,01:13:46.97,01:13:46.97,"On a daily basis, I would clam."
1393,01:13:49.07,01:13:49.07,"Every two to three days, I would get water."
1394,01:13:52.37,01:13:52.37,"Uh, every night, I would make sure the fire was, uh..."
1395,01:13:54.83,01:13:54.83,"uh, keeping us all warm,"
1396,01:13:57.03,01:13:57.03,"as well as, uh, tending to the wonderful soup"
1397,01:14:00.63,01:14:00.63,"that, uh... uh, allowed us to survive for so many days."
1398,01:14:04.37,01:14:04.37,"I knew what had to be done,"
1399,01:14:05.60,01:14:05.60,and I was more than willing and able.
1400,01:14:07.03,01:14:07.03,Okay. Thank you. They... I'm satisfied.
1401,01:14:12.13,01:14:12.13,Helen.
1402,01:14:16.70,01:14:16.70,"Well, we spent 37 days together."
1403,01:14:21.83,01:14:21.83,And I had my mind made up week two
1404,01:14:23.70,01:14:23.70,"who I was going to vote for, but that got ripped"
1405,01:14:26.00,01:14:26.00,right out of my mind the night I left here.
1406,01:14:29.33,01:14:29.33,"I asked you, Brian, point-blank"
1407,01:14:31.77,01:14:31.77,"if I was going, because you and I had that thing going."
1408,01:14:35.17,01:14:35.17,"We had that trust, that we'd give the other person"
1409,01:14:38.10,01:14:38.10,the courtesy of telling them.
1410,01:14:40.03,01:14:40.03,But you and Clay told me Jan was going.
1411,01:14:42.07,01:14:42.07,And Jan appeared to me really upset that day.
1412,01:14:44.47,01:14:44.47,"And I went to both of you, and I said, ""You know what?"
1413,01:14:47.73,01:14:47.73,"I think she deserves to know she's going."""
1414,01:14:49.50,01:14:49.50,"And you both looked right at me and said, ""No."
1415,01:14:52.20,01:14:52.20,"""Leave her alone. She knows she's going."
1416,01:14:54.43,01:14:54.43,"Why make her miserable?"" Knowing full well"
1417,01:14:56.90,01:14:56.90,that you had turned the tables on me.
1418,01:14:59.20,01:14:59.20,You promised me it was us three going to the threesome.
1419,01:15:03.10,01:15:03.10,But neither one of you were man enough to tell me.
1420,01:15:06.63,01:15:06.63,"Clay, it doesn't surprise me from you."
1421,01:15:08.30,01:15:08.30,You lived up to exactly what I thought you were
1422,01:15:10.50,01:15:10.50,the whole time out there.
1423,01:15:12.43,01:15:12.43,"But, Brian, felt like I was living the Julius Caesar play."
1424,01:15:16.07,01:15:16.07,"I wanted to turn around and say, ""Et tu, Brute?"""
1425,01:15:20.17,01:15:20.17,"You are the epitome of the trashy used-car salesman,"
1426,01:15:24.13,01:15:24.13,and I have to tell you it really hurt.
1427,01:15:27.97,01:15:27.97,"You duped me, you made a fool of me,"
1428,01:15:31.53,01:15:31.53,"you strung me along, and you let me sit here and get stunned."
1429,01:15:36.13,01:15:36.13,So now is your opportunity to tell me
1430,01:15:39.13,01:15:39.13,why you didn't give me the...
1431,01:15:41.53,01:15:41.53,"the decency, after all that time, to tell me,"
1432,01:15:45.60,01:15:45.60,and then follow up with why I should vote for you.
1433,01:15:48.40,01:15:48.40,Sure.
1434,01:15:50.23,01:15:50.23,"When... about two days prior,"
1435,01:15:53.77,01:15:53.77,"when, uh, you and Ted thought Jan was sleeping,"
1436,01:15:57.37,01:15:57.37,there was a pecking order that you were scheming with Ted
1437,01:16:00.43,01:16:00.43,that was told to me through Jan.
1438,01:16:02.87,01:16:02.87,"It was, uh, written in the sand."
1439,01:16:04.30,01:16:04.30,"I was extremely surprised, coming from you."
1440,01:16:06.73,01:16:06.73,I felt just as betrayed as you did at the time.
1441,01:16:10.60,01:16:10.60,I felt hurt.
1442,01:16:12.20,01:16:12.20,"I felt, uh, we did have a relationship."
1443,01:16:14.80,01:16:14.80,We had a friendship.
1444,01:16:16.13,01:16:16.13,I felt you misused the trust.
1445,01:16:17.73,01:16:17.73,You scheme up a plan to go against me...
1446,01:16:20.37,01:16:20.37,"And I told you, Brian, that if I ever changed my mind"
1447,01:16:24.33,01:16:24.33,that I would tell you first.
1448,01:16:25.87,01:16:25.87,I never came to you to tell you that
1449,01:16:28.00,01:16:28.00,because I never changed my mind.
1450,01:16:30.20,01:16:30.20,Your name was never on my ballot.
1451,01:16:32.83,01:16:32.83,I'm asking you your specific reason
1452,01:16:34.83,01:16:34.83,for not telling me that night as we were walking out.
1453,01:16:38.47,01:16:38.47,Because of the knife that you put in my back
1454,01:16:41.73,01:16:41.73,"through the, uh... what Jan told me."
1455,01:16:44.30,01:16:44.30,Hearsay? Hearsay? Something that didn't come from me?
1456,01:16:47.37,01:16:47.37,"-She saw it. She heard it, Hel... -Something that you"
1457,01:16:48.93,01:16:48.93,"didn't ask me about, this is what you're going on?"
1458,01:16:50.87,01:16:50.87,-You played a game with... -This is what
1459,01:16:52.27,01:16:52.27,you're going on? This is what you're going on?
1460,01:16:53.83,01:16:53.83,-Hearsay? Mm-hmm. -Yes. Yes.
1461,01:16:55.07,01:16:55.07,You didn't come to me and ask me?
1462,01:16:56.37,01:16:56.37,"I was hurt, just like you were hurt."
1463,01:16:58.63,01:16:58.63,"I misled you, and I admit it."
1464,01:17:02.40,01:17:02.40,-I couldn't tell you that I felt betrayed. -Why?
1465,01:17:05.63,01:17:05.63,This is what I'm going for-- why?
1466,01:17:06.90,01:17:06.90,Because I felt you were trying to take me out next.
1467,01:17:08.97,01:17:08.97,I'm just asking why you didn't think I deserved the decency
1468,01:17:13.00,01:17:13.00,"of a, ""Yes, H, you're going."""
1469,01:17:14.33,01:17:14.33,You could've done it as we were walking out the door.
1470,01:17:16.07,01:17:16.07,Code of silence after that--
1471,01:17:17.33,01:17:17.33,you would've never had to deal with me again.
1472,01:17:19.00,01:17:19.00,"I was very angry at you scheming against me, so..."
1473,01:17:20.83,01:17:20.83,"Again, hearsay."
1474,01:17:22.20,01:17:22.20,"PROBST: Helen, let him... give him a chance to answer."
1475,01:17:23.87,01:17:23.87,"-All right. -BRIAN: I was very angry at you,"
1476,01:17:25.67,01:17:25.67,and I wanted you to hear it
1477,01:17:27.53,01:17:27.53,and feel it that night at the jury.
1478,01:17:29.67,01:17:29.67,That I was pissed at you for going behind my back
1479,01:17:32.53,01:17:32.53,"after the relationship that we did have,"
1480,01:17:34.37,01:17:34.37,"that I thought I could trust you as well,"
1481,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,and you did this to me.
1482,01:17:38.00,01:17:38.00,You put together a plan with Ted.
1483,01:17:39.40,01:17:39.40,I heard it through Jan. That pissed me off.
1484,01:17:42.10,01:17:42.10,"Yes, I did it out of anger, and I admit it."
1485,01:17:44.80,01:17:44.80,I completely admit I was not honest with you.
1486,01:17:47.80,01:17:47.80,"Okay, and part B: Why should I vote for you tonight?"
1487,01:17:50.57,01:17:50.57,(sighs)
1488,01:17:51.93,01:17:51.93,"For one mistake, uh, for... for a, uh..."
1489,01:17:55.73,01:17:55.73,"a truth that I admit, an apology,"
1490,01:17:59.17,01:17:59.17,"a, uh, uh..."
1491,01:18:01.87,01:18:01.87,"period of 38, 37 days-- whatever we spent together--"
1492,01:18:05.03,01:18:05.03,I made one mistake with you.
1493,01:18:06.63,01:18:06.63,"I didn't tell you you were going that night, and I apologize."
1494,01:18:09.27,01:18:09.27,I take full responsibility for that.
1495,01:18:11.17,01:18:11.17,I felt that you were powerful enough
1496,01:18:14.13,01:18:14.13,to get me the following day.
1497,01:18:16.47,01:18:16.47,"That's how I felt, and I apologize."
1498,01:18:24.57,01:18:24.57,"It's a little late now, but..."
1499,01:18:27.67,01:18:27.67,"Clay, I'd sort of like you to explain to me"
1500,01:18:30.97,01:18:30.97,"why you think-- and I'd actually like three,"
1501,01:18:34.70,01:18:34.70,if you can come up with three-- reasons of how you
1502,01:18:38.27,01:18:38.27,contributed to eight people
1503,01:18:42.27,01:18:42.27,having to survive on that island.
1504,01:18:46.50,01:18:46.50,"Uh, uh... I did stuff every day."
1505,01:18:49.67,01:18:49.67,I did a little bit every day.
1506,01:18:51.60,01:18:51.60,That's all I got to say.
1507,01:18:53.27,01:18:53.27,"I asked for three reasons on what, on a daily basis..."
1508,01:18:55.50,01:18:55.50,"CLAY: Well, you're not gonna get three."
1509,01:18:56.53,01:18:56.53,"Helen, you don't understand, because I can tell right now"
1510,01:18:58.43,01:18:58.43,there's no way in the world to satisfy your answer.
1511,01:19:00.90,01:19:00.90,So why try?
1512,01:19:03.00,01:19:03.00,Okay. Okay.
1513,01:19:05.00,01:19:05.00,Then I'm satisfied.
1514,01:19:06.53,01:19:06.53,"-Thanks, Helen. -Thank you."
1515,01:19:10.40,01:19:10.40,"Jury, thank you for your questions."
1516,01:19:12.87,01:19:12.87,You now have a big decision to make.
1517,01:19:15.27,01:19:15.27,Who will walk away with the title of sole Survivor?
1518,01:19:19.43,01:19:19.43,Take a minute. Think about it.
1519,01:19:44.67,01:19:44.67,"PROBST: Okay, jury."
1520,01:19:46.17,01:19:46.17,"Well, with everything that has been said tonight,"
1521,01:19:49.17,01:19:49.17,I hope you were able to gather
1522,01:19:50.97,01:19:50.97,the information you need to make your decision.
1523,01:19:52.97,01:19:52.97,The ball is now in your court.
1524,01:19:55.30,01:19:55.30,One very big difference in tonight's vote.
1525,01:19:58.23,01:19:58.23,"Tonight, the jury is voting  for somebody;"
1526,01:20:03.10,01:20:03.10,you're not voting against.
1527,01:20:05.17,01:20:05.17,You're voting for who you think
1528,01:20:06.80,01:20:06.80,deserves the title of sole Survivor.
1529,01:20:09.07,01:20:09.07,"Clay and Brian, you want to see your name on the ballot tonight."
1530,01:20:13.20,01:20:13.20,Big decision. You ready to make it?
1531,01:20:15.97,01:20:15.97,"It is time to vote. Erin, you're up."
1532,01:20:38.90,01:20:38.90,I'm actually voting for Clay tonight.
1533,01:20:42.30,01:20:42.30," I'm basing my vote on honesty,  and, Clay,"
1534,01:20:44.77,01:20:44.77, I feel that you have been  honest to everyone.
1535,01:20:47.20,01:20:47.20,"On the other hand, I do not feel Brian has."
1536,01:20:53.63,01:20:53.63,Good luck.
1537,01:21:32.43,01:21:32.43,"You know, this would have been"
1538,01:21:36.10,01:21:36.10,"a very, very easy decision."
1539,01:21:38.80,01:21:38.80," You messed up, Brian.  You messed up."
1540,01:21:41.73,01:21:41.73, You assumed
1541,01:21:42.73,01:21:42.73,that what we were writing in the sand
1542,01:21:45.17,01:21:45.17,was a scheme against you.
1543,01:21:47.43,01:21:47.43,It wasn't.
1544,01:21:49.07,01:21:49.07,It was a scheme
1545,01:21:50.43,01:21:50.43," against Clay, not you."
1546,01:21:52.80,01:21:52.80,You need to check yourself.
1547,01:21:54.10,01:21:54.10,I know that there are people out there
1548,01:21:55.63,01:21:55.63,that remain committed to their word.
1549,01:21:56.80,01:21:56.80, My word was my bond.
1550,01:21:59.60,01:21:59.60,And it's pitiful that you didn't know that.
1551,01:22:02.60,01:22:02.60,But that you are the lesser of the two evils.
1552,01:22:35.63,01:22:35.63,"PENNY:  I think that,"
1553,01:22:37.50,01:22:37.50,"uh, of the two that are left, um, that Clay"
1554,01:22:41.07,01:22:41.07, really took the time  to get to know me as a person
1555,01:22:44.07,01:22:44.07,"in the 12 days I had with them,  and Brian never did."
1556,01:23:24.27,01:23:24.27,"Brian, what happened between you and I"
1557,01:23:26.07,01:23:26.07, happened between you and I.
1558,01:23:27.67,01:23:27.67,"But in the context of the game,  I'm a bigger person"
1559,01:23:30.20,01:23:30.20,and can look beyond what happened to me.
1560,01:23:33.93,01:23:33.93, You deserve to win.
1561,01:23:35.37,01:23:35.37, You had a work ethic  that was great
1562,01:23:37.47,01:23:37.47, the entire time out here.
1563,01:23:38.90,01:23:38.90,"Several of the team challenges,"
1564,01:23:40.23,01:23:40.23,"you almost single-handedly won on your own,"
1565,01:23:43.27,01:23:43.27,"so for that and your work ethic, you get my vote tonight."
1566,01:23:47.60,01:23:47.60,Good luck.
1567,01:23:51.30,01:23:51.30,Hope you win.
1568,01:24:06.37,01:24:06.37,I'll go tally the votes.
