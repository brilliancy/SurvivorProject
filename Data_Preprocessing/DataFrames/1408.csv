32,00:01:28.67,00:01:28.67,>> I think you should ( bleep )push over a little bit unless

35,00:01:35.58,00:01:35.58,"about him, and I think one ofthe reasons that Ravu didn't"
36,00:01:38.58,00:01:38.58,ever win was his attitude aboutstuff.
37,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,>> The idol is on this island.It's here.
38,00:01:43.17,00:01:43.17,">> PROBST: And in order to saveherself, Lisi revealed clues to"

41,00:01:50.17,00:01:50.17,prowling around the island.>> Alex and I figured out that
42,00:01:52.33,00:01:52.33,we don't need really strongplayers.
43,00:01:54.38,00:01:54.38,What we need is people that areloyal.
44,00:01:56.88,00:01:56.88,>> PROBST: At tribal council...The seventh person voted out and

47,00:02:04.83,00:02:04.83,"Rocky, the tribe has spoken.11 are left."
48,00:02:08.33,00:02:08.33,Who will be voted out tonight?>> Edgardo and I are sort of in
49,00:02:36.88,00:02:36.88,between a couple alliances.It seems like he and I are
50,00:02:39.33,00:02:39.33,"aligned with Mookie and Dreamzon the one hand, and we're"
51,00:02:43.33,00:02:43.33,aligned with Lisi on the otherhand.
52,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,Edgardo and myself had aprevious alliance with her when
53,00:02:47.71,00:02:47.71,we were all part of Moto.So right now I feel like I'm in
54,00:02:50.33,00:02:50.33,a pretty good place.After Lisi got back from Exile
55,00:03:00.08,00:03:00.08,"Island, she told Alex and me twoclues."
56,00:03:02.25,00:03:02.25,"One of the clues was ""It's atthe highest point in the island."
57,00:03:05.12,00:03:05.12,"Dig down.""And the other clue said, ""Dig"
58,00:03:08.04,00:03:08.04,"beneath where you sleep.""So myself, Alex, and Edgardo"
59,00:03:21.29,00:03:21.29,were digging for the idol whileLisi and Dreamz were sleeping.
60,00:03:25.88,00:03:25.88,">> A little left, six inches.Right there."
61,00:03:32.04,00:03:32.04,">> I know that myself, Dreamz,Edgardo, and Alex made a pact"
62,00:03:35.58,00:03:35.58,together.But I need to figure out how I'm
63,00:03:39.42,00:03:39.42,going to secure my space withinthis trust.
64,00:03:58.29,00:03:58.29,"I was digging in the right placeat the right time, and I don't"
65,00:04:01.42,00:04:01.42,"know how they didn't hear that,but I got the immunity idol."
66,00:04:04.17,00:04:04.17,Hopefully it's smooth sailingfrom here.
67,00:04:42.25,00:04:42.25,>> Lisi let us in on basicallyall the clues to find the
68,00:04:44.62,00:04:44.62,"immunity idol.So we started digging, we"
69,00:04:47.75,00:04:47.75,"adjusted a little bit, and loand behold, the three of us"
70,00:04:49.88,00:04:49.88,found it while everyone else wasasleep.
71,00:04:53.92,00:04:53.92,>> There is no words to describehow much this means to me in
72,00:04:57.29,00:04:57.29,"this game.So to bring this back, it holds"
73,00:05:02.04,00:05:02.04,my position for sure.>> The reason we didn't tell
74,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,"Lisi is because even though sheis really loyal, she's an"
75,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17,unstable person.We were afraid that if we told
76,00:05:27.67,00:05:27.67,"her, she would want to use itthe wrong way, just because I"
77,00:05:31.79,00:05:31.79,don't think Lisi is a very smartperson playing the game.
78,00:05:34.33,00:05:34.33,>> Don't tell Dreamz.>> Don't tell him until it's
79,00:05:36.50,00:05:36.50,necessary.>> We're not telling Dreamz
80,00:05:42.79,00:05:42.79,"about the immunity idol becausehe's very close with Cassandra,"
81,00:05:46.00,00:05:46.00,"and if there is a merge, he mayhave just a flareup of, like,"
82,00:05:49.96,00:05:49.96,"complete honesty and tellCassandra, tell who knows what"
83,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,"about the immunity idol.And once they know we have it,"
84,00:05:55.29,00:05:55.29,"its effect is gone.>> You can say that myself, Alex"
85,00:06:02.08,00:06:02.08,"and Edgardo have the idol, butin my mind, it's in one pocket,"
86,00:06:06.96,00:06:06.96,and that's in my pocket.>> A little idol digging?
87,00:06:31.50,00:06:31.50,">> Yeah.>> Yeah, that's where I suspect"
88,00:06:34.08,00:06:34.08,"it is, right around there.It's got to be right here where"
89,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,we're sleeping.I suspect Alex told Mookie that
90,00:06:40.42,00:06:40.42,the idol is right where wesleep.
91,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,"Because this morning Mookietried to be, like, a little"
92,00:06:46.83,00:06:46.83,"discreet, flipping leaves andtrying to play with the ground,"
93,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,"and I was like, ""What, idoldigging?"""
94,00:06:51.92,00:06:51.92,"And he had no choice but to say,""Uh, yeah."""
95,00:06:54.71,00:06:54.71,"I'm like, ""Dude, you're going tohave to wake up really, really"
96,00:06:56.75,00:06:56.75,early to fool an old cat likeme.
97,00:06:59.00,00:06:59.00,"What's wrong with you?"">> I have the idol, and Lisi is"
98,00:07:15.29,00:07:15.29,still digging for it.She has no idea.
99,00:07:17.71,00:07:17.71,And I'm going to help her dig.And that's the funny part.
100,00:07:27.62,00:07:27.62,">> Oh, my god!>> Hola."
101,00:07:35.88,00:07:35.88,>> Hola.>> Hola.
102,00:07:39.04,00:07:39.04,">> Great, you guys, come on withus!"
103,00:07:47.21,00:07:47.21,">> Today, you will learn atraditional Fijian miki, a"
104,00:07:50.04,00:07:50.04,"dance.>> Oh, my god!"
105,00:07:52.42,00:07:52.42,>> The skilled Fijian dancersare here to teach you how to do
106,00:07:55.25,00:07:55.25,it.They will instruct you for two
107,00:07:57.25,00:07:57.25,hours.>> You will compete against the
108,00:07:59.08,00:07:59.08,other tribe this afternoon andtry to outdance them at a local
109,00:08:01.71,00:08:01.71,village.The winners stay for a feast at
110,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,the village.>> It looks like we have a
111,00:08:07.29,00:08:07.29,dance-off competition with Ravutoday.
112,00:08:10.58,00:08:10.58,And we had some Fijian dancerscome and school us.
113,00:08:13.21,00:08:13.21,And then if we win we get a nicespread of food.
114,00:08:18.17,00:08:18.17,>> We have to sit one personout.
115,00:08:20.00,00:08:20.00,>> One person out.>> I'm all knees here when
116,00:08:21.75,00:08:21.75,"dancing.>> Well, you're sitting out."
117,00:08:23.46,00:08:23.46,">> When it comes to dancing, Ihave absolutely no rhythm."
118,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,I can't keep the beat if my lifedepends on it.
119,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> I got the moves.I got the moves.
120,00:08:44.38,00:08:44.38,"You know, I had to pull out someof my Michael Jackson moves, you"
121,00:08:46.21,00:08:46.21,"know?They put me up front, and I'm"
122,00:08:48.21,00:08:48.21,ready to take the lead.>> That's a little too much
123,00:08:53.88,00:08:53.88,"hips, Boo.>> It was funny seeing Boo, you"
124,00:08:56.58,00:08:56.58,know?Boo was doing the whole... the
125,00:08:59.00,00:08:59.00,"white guy thing.But he hung in there, and he's"
126,00:09:01.17,00:09:01.17,making a great effort at it.I think we'll be okay.
127,00:09:21.12,00:09:21.12,">> Size, strength, and agilityis not necessarily going to be"
128,00:09:24.21,00:09:24.21,an advantage on this one.There's no way Yau-Man and those
129,00:09:27.04,00:09:27.04,girls are going to beat us atthis.
130,00:09:29.00,00:09:29.00,"I mean, it's kind offrustrating, right?"
131,00:09:31.00,00:09:31.00,Because we've lost twice to abunch of girls and an old guy.
132,00:09:33.25,00:09:33.25,"If we don't all work in unison,we don't eat."
133,00:09:38.83,00:09:38.83,>> ( speaking in Fijianlanguage )
134,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,>> Okay.Okay.
135,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,">> Challenges, honestly, I don'ttake seriously."
136,00:09:48.38,00:09:48.38,"I don't think we should be outhere brooding about ""We've got"
137,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,"to win,"" or ""We've got to eatthat food!"""
138,00:09:55.00,00:09:55.00,"I mean, come on, guys.>> I really don't like Lisi."
139,00:10:07.92,00:10:07.92,Lisi was one of the reasons thatI was so miserable at Moto.
140,00:10:10.83,00:10:10.83,Every challenge she's done hasbeen horrible.
141,00:10:13.38,00:10:13.38,"So Lisi should be worried,because she's the weakest, and"
142,00:10:15.54,00:10:15.54,we're trying to get to the mergewith numbers up.
143,00:10:17.67,00:10:17.67,"If we lose a challenge, she willbe the next person voted off."
144,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,">> PROBST: Moto, come on in!Moto looking good."

193,00:15:24.96,00:15:24.96,better organized.And I think the leader was
194,00:15:28.67,00:15:28.67,"really good.Whereas Ravu, their body"
195,00:15:34.08,00:15:34.08,movement was out of rhythm withthe chant.
196,00:15:38.92,00:15:38.92,They were either too fast againor behind in their actions.

210,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,enjoy an authentic Fijian feastthat's been cooking for hours
211,00:16:38.08,00:16:38.08,"especially for you.Some singing, and it starts now."
212,00:16:44.92,00:16:44.92,">> One thing about being part ofthis game, we haven't had a"
213,00:16:46.79,00:16:46.79,"chance to experience what'shere-- you know, the beauty of"
214,00:16:49.75,00:16:49.75,Fiji and the people and thenatives.
215,00:16:51.62,00:16:51.62,We don't know anything.And that was the first time we
216,00:16:53.46,00:16:53.46,"got to actually absorb theculture, and that's fascinating"
217,00:16:55.88,00:16:55.88,"to me.>> Oh, my god!"
218,00:17:05.08,00:17:05.08,"It's so beautiful!>> My mouth is, like, watering"
219,00:17:11.67,00:17:11.67,right now.The feast was the one of the
220,00:17:14.25,00:17:14.25,most incredible things that I'veever experienced.
221,00:17:17.25,00:17:17.25,"There were huge lobsters.They had chicken, big pieces of"
222,00:17:20.54,00:17:20.54,papaya.We were eating with both our
223,00:17:23.25,00:17:23.25,"hands.It was just amazing-- the food,"
224,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,"the people, it was justincredible."

227,00:17:36.08,00:17:36.08,These people have such hugehearts.
228,00:17:38.54,00:17:38.54,I don't think that any one of uswill ever forget this for the
229,00:17:40.62,00:17:40.62,rest of our lives.>> A night like this brings us
230,00:17:51.04,00:17:51.04,"closer together, because we werestill kind of separated."
231,00:17:53.96,00:17:53.96,"You know, it was still kind ofsome old Ravu and old Moto."
232,00:17:57.29,00:17:57.29,"I mean, we still hadn'tconnected all the way."
233,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,"And I think a celebration likethis feels good as a group, that"
234,00:18:03.83,00:18:03.83,we can finally push forward andkeep going as a solid group now.
235,00:18:07.17,00:18:07.17,"This time it's our turn in thesun, and I'm happy."
236,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> The game just gets so darksometimes.
237,00:18:29.25,00:18:29.25,Ravu just can't seem to win eventhe simplest challenges.
238,00:18:32.46,00:18:32.46,This is kind of serious forsomeone that likes to take it
239,00:18:35.12,00:18:35.12,light.It sucks that I'm here.
240,00:18:42.62,00:18:42.62,"I mean, like, look at me-- I'm amoment away from crying."
241,00:18:45.25,00:18:45.25,I don't want to be here.This sucks.
242,00:18:48.29,00:18:48.29,"I really don't want to be here.But what am I supposed to do,"
243,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,man?This sucks.
244,00:18:57.00,00:18:57.00,There's only so much of this Ican take.
245,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,"I don't want to let down Alexand Edgardo, but I feel like"

247,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,"morning meetings, because I'musually the first person up, and"
248,00:19:33.79,00:19:33.79,"then she gets up pretty soon,and everyone else is always just"
249,00:19:36.29,00:19:36.29,"laying there.So we always get up, and she"
250,00:19:38.71,00:19:38.71,"briefs me on what's happening,because she is my little spy."
251,00:19:41.79,00:19:41.79,"I think, Boo, if you put Boo inthe right situation, he'll be"
252,00:19:46.46,00:19:46.46,"with us.>> Uh-huh, yeah."
253,00:19:48.96,00:19:48.96,">> But I still wasn't sure,because Cassandra said Boo is"
254,00:19:51.29,00:19:51.29,dangerous.If Boo makes the merger he'll be
255,00:19:53.71,00:19:53.71,the most dangerous.I don't know.
256,00:20:00.33,00:20:00.33,>> Stacy's got that fourth card.>> She wants to do that.
257,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,And that's what makes her alittle more dangerous because
258,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,her vote's going to switch.>> That's why I feel like Stacy
259,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"first, because that will scareBoo and get him on our side."
260,00:20:11.04,00:20:11.04,>> Yeah.>> Earl and I are targeting
261,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,Stacy.She still does have ties on the
262,00:20:15.54,00:20:15.54,"other side, particularly withAlex."
263,00:20:18.46,00:20:18.46,"Ideally we'd want to get rid ofStacy before the merge, because"
264,00:20:21.12,00:20:21.12,that's when we feel like she'llbe most dangerous.
265,00:20:23.79,00:20:23.79,>> One of those two has to go atthe next immunity.
266,00:20:26.50,00:20:26.50,>> I feel like it will have tobe Stacy.
267,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,"I am afraid that the longerStacy sticks around, the more in"
268,00:20:32.08,00:20:32.08,"danger it put me, because me andStacy are kind of carbon copies"
269,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83,of each other when it comes downto function.
270,00:20:39.62,00:20:39.62,I don't think there's enoughroom for the both of us.
271,00:20:44.71,00:20:44.71,>> We've got to get out of thislosing spirit.
272,00:20:51.50,00:20:51.50,">> I'm feeling confident, still.I'm pretty sure tomorrow we're"
273,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,going to merge.>> Right now I'm really worried
274,00:21:06.46,00:21:06.46,"that Dreamz might be tight withCassandra, and he might flip"
275,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,over.So I think I am going to keep my
276,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,eye on him because I know he isgoing to be a threat.
277,00:21:26.12,00:21:26.12,>> This is pretty cool.>> Interesting...
278,00:21:29.08,00:21:29.08,">> All right.""Everybody gets their shot."

281,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,"bad.Going into a merge 4-6, much"
282,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,harder than 5-5.>> Ever shot a bow and arrow?
283,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,>> Yeah.>> I haven't.
284,00:21:47.29,00:21:47.29,>> It's all about keeping yourarm straight.

413,00:31:52.38,00:31:52.38,quit pissed me off because Icould probably use her in the
414,00:31:55.79,00:31:55.79,"future, because she's a solidvote, but hey, I try not to"
415,00:31:58.42,00:31:58.42,judge people in life.I'm not going to judge Lisi now.

422,00:32:16.54,00:32:16.54,it's time to go.And I just kind of feel like
423,00:32:19.08,00:32:19.08,it's the end of the game for me.I've gotten further than I ever
424,00:32:22.46,00:32:22.46,"thought I would get, and I justdon't see the need to push"
425,00:32:25.54,00:32:25.54,myself any further.I'm done like a Thanksgiving day
426,00:32:28.79,00:32:28.79,"turkey, man-- I'm done.But it's cool, it's cool."

441,00:33:44.00,00:33:44.00,"All I can say is I was sittinghere thinking, and I was"
442,00:33:47.08,00:33:47.08,"thinking some more, and that'swhy I pulled you guys over."

452,00:34:13.79,00:34:13.79,away or... but we've just kepton playing.
453,00:34:33.17,00:34:33.17,>> Tonight we have to go totribal council and vote somebody

456,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,"And that worries me a littlebit, but, I mean, you have to do"
457,00:34:42.12,00:34:42.12,"what you have to do.>> In my eyes, Dreamz should be"
458,00:34:47.67,00:34:47.67,"the next one to go tonight.I would vote for him, Alex would"
459,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,"vote for him, Edgardo would votefor him."
460,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,"So that's three votes.Mookie's going to vote for me,"
461,00:34:56.46,00:34:56.46,and Dreamz will vote for me aswell.
