1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.12,00:00:03.12,Survivor: Lisi returned from Exile
3,00:00:05.29,00:00:05.29,"Island... >> Welcome home, baby!"
4,00:00:07.54,00:00:07.54,>> PROBST: ...and joined the new all-male Ravu tribe.
5,00:00:09.71,00:00:09.71,">> Back at Moto, I didn't like her, she didn't like me."
6,00:00:12.00,00:00:12.00,So she should be worried. >> I'm with the boys!
7,00:00:14.29,00:00:14.29,">> PROBST: She didn't realize that Alex, Edgardo, Dreamz, and"
8,00:00:17.54,00:00:17.54,Mookie had already formed a tight alliance of four.
9,00:00:21.92,00:00:21.92,"At the new Moto, Yau-Man discovered the hidden immunity"
10,00:00:26.17,00:00:26.17,idol. >> This is my million dollars!
11,00:00:28.38,00:00:28.38,>> PROBST: And he realized another one existed on Ravu's
12,00:00:30.33,00:00:30.33,beach. >> I know there's another one
13,00:00:32.92,00:00:32.92,somewhere on the other island. >> PROBST: At a fiery reward
14,00:00:35.96,00:00:35.96,challenge... Dreamz with a big launch.
15,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,Is it enough? It is!
16,00:00:42.12,00:00:42.12,Dreamz secured a victory for Ravu.
17,00:00:44.08,00:00:44.08,Ravu wins their first challenge! And they were whisked away to a
18,00:00:47.88,00:00:47.88,"remote arcade, where they gorged on hot dogs, beer, and brownies."
19,00:00:53.12,00:00:53.12,">> As soon as we saw the food it was like a feeding frenzy, man."
20,00:00:55.58,00:00:55.58,This is terrible. >> PROBST: And then paid the
21,00:00:58.83,00:00:58.83,price. >> I just ate way too much food.
22,00:01:01.54,00:01:01.54,>> You guys better be ready for the challenge soon.
23,00:01:03.42,00:01:03.42,>> PROBST: Rocky showed no sympathy.
24,00:01:05.38,00:01:05.38,>> You got what you wanted. Suck it up.
25,00:01:08.08,00:01:08.08,>> Follow the rail! Follow the rail!
26,00:01:10.08,00:01:10.08,>> PROBST: At an injury-laden immunity challenge...
27,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,">> Mookie, run! >> Cannibal, cannibal."
28,00:01:15.17,00:01:15.17,>> PROBST: ...Moto again claimed immunity.
29,00:01:17.25,00:01:17.25,Cannibal Island is correct! Moto wins immunity!
30,00:01:20.29,00:01:20.29,And Ravu was forced to choose yet another tribemate to leave
31,00:01:24.58,00:01:24.58,the game. >> I hate going to tribal
32,00:01:26.92,00:01:26.92,council. >> What do you think?
33,00:01:28.67,00:01:28.67,>> I think you should ( bleep ) push over a little bit unless
34,00:01:30.58,00:01:30.58,you want to make out with me. >> PROBST: Rocky's attitude had
35,00:01:33.12,00:01:33.12,him on the bubble. >> Rocky has just this bad vibe
36,00:01:35.58,00:01:35.58,"about him, and I think one of the reasons that Ravu didn't"
37,00:01:38.58,00:01:38.58,ever win was his attitude about stuff.
38,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,>> The idol is on this island. It's here.
39,00:01:43.17,00:01:43.17,">> PROBST: And in order to save herself, Lisi revealed clues to"
40,00:01:45.33,00:01:45.33,the whereabouts of the hidden idol.
41,00:01:47.42,00:01:47.42,">> With the clues I have, you, me, and Edgardo should start"
42,00:01:50.17,00:01:50.17,prowling around the island. >> Alex and I figured out that
43,00:01:52.33,00:01:52.33,we don't need really strong players.
44,00:01:54.38,00:01:54.38,What we need is people that are loyal.
45,00:01:56.88,00:01:56.88,>> PROBST: At tribal council... The seventh person voted out and
46,00:01:59.54,00:01:59.54,the first member of our jury. ...Rocky was blindsided and
47,00:02:02.46,00:02:02.46,become the first member of our jury.
48,00:02:04.83,00:02:04.83,"Rocky, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left."
49,00:02:08.33,00:02:08.33,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Edgardo and I are sort of in
50,00:02:36.88,00:02:36.88,between a couple alliances. It seems like he and I are
51,00:02:39.33,00:02:39.33,"aligned with Mookie and Dreamz on the one hand, and we're"
52,00:02:43.33,00:02:43.33,aligned with Lisi on the other hand.
53,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,Edgardo and myself had a previous alliance with her when
54,00:02:47.71,00:02:47.71,we were all part of Moto. So right now I feel like I'm in
55,00:02:50.33,00:02:50.33,a pretty good place. After Lisi got back from Exile
56,00:03:00.08,00:03:00.08,"Island, she told Alex and me two clues."
57,00:03:02.25,00:03:02.25,"One of the clues was ""It's at the highest point in the island."
58,00:03:05.12,00:03:05.12,"Dig down."" And the other clue said, ""Dig"
59,00:03:08.04,00:03:08.04,"beneath where you sleep."" So myself, Alex, and Edgardo"
60,00:03:21.29,00:03:21.29,were digging for the idol while Lisi and Dreamz were sleeping.
61,00:03:25.88,00:03:25.88,">> A little left, six inches. Right there."
62,00:03:32.04,00:03:32.04,">> I know that myself, Dreamz, Edgardo, and Alex made a pact"
63,00:03:35.58,00:03:35.58,together. But I need to figure out how I'm
64,00:03:39.42,00:03:39.42,going to secure my space within this trust.
65,00:03:58.29,00:03:58.29,"I was digging in the right place at the right time, and I don't"
66,00:04:01.42,00:04:01.42,"know how they didn't hear that, but I got the immunity idol."
67,00:04:04.17,00:04:04.17,Hopefully it's smooth sailing from here.
68,00:04:42.25,00:04:42.25,>> Lisi let us in on basically all the clues to find the
69,00:04:44.62,00:04:44.62,"immunity idol. So we started digging, we"
70,00:04:47.75,00:04:47.75,"adjusted a little bit, and lo and behold, the three of us"
71,00:04:49.88,00:04:49.88,found it while everyone else was asleep.
72,00:04:53.92,00:04:53.92,>> There is no words to describe how much this means to me in
73,00:04:57.29,00:04:57.29,"this game. So to bring this back, it holds"
74,00:05:02.04,00:05:02.04,my position for sure. >> The reason we didn't tell
75,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,"Lisi is because even though she is really loyal, she's an"
76,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17,unstable person. We were afraid that if we told
77,00:05:27.67,00:05:27.67,"her, she would want to use it the wrong way, just because I"
78,00:05:31.79,00:05:31.79,don't think Lisi is a very smart person playing the game.
79,00:05:34.33,00:05:34.33,>> Don't tell Dreamz. >> Don't tell him until it's
80,00:05:36.50,00:05:36.50,necessary. >> We're not telling Dreamz
81,00:05:42.79,00:05:42.79,"about the immunity idol because he's very close with Cassandra,"
82,00:05:46.00,00:05:46.00,"and if there is a merge, he may have just a flareup of, like,"
83,00:05:49.96,00:05:49.96,"complete honesty and tell Cassandra, tell who knows what"
84,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,"about the immunity idol. And once they know we have it,"
85,00:05:55.29,00:05:55.29,"its effect is gone. >> You can say that myself, Alex"
86,00:06:02.08,00:06:02.08,"and Edgardo have the idol, but in my mind, it's in one pocket,"
87,00:06:06.96,00:06:06.96,and that's in my pocket. >> A little idol digging?
88,00:06:31.50,00:06:31.50,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, that's where I suspect"
89,00:06:34.08,00:06:34.08,"it is, right around there. It's got to be right here where"
90,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,we're sleeping. I suspect Alex told Mookie that
91,00:06:40.42,00:06:40.42,the idol is right where we sleep.
92,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,"Because this morning Mookie tried to be, like, a little"
93,00:06:46.83,00:06:46.83,"discreet, flipping leaves and trying to play with the ground,"
94,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,"and I was like, ""What, idol digging?"""
95,00:06:51.92,00:06:51.92,"And he had no choice but to say, ""Uh, yeah."""
96,00:06:54.71,00:06:54.71,"I'm like, ""Dude, you're going to have to wake up really, really"
97,00:06:56.75,00:06:56.75,early to fool an old cat like me.
98,00:06:59.00,00:06:59.00,"What's wrong with you?"" >> I have the idol, and Lisi is"
99,00:07:15.29,00:07:15.29,still digging for it. She has no idea.
100,00:07:17.71,00:07:17.71,And I'm going to help her dig. And that's the funny part.
101,00:07:27.62,00:07:27.62,">> Oh, my god! >> Hola."
102,00:07:35.88,00:07:35.88,>> Hola. >> Hola.
103,00:07:39.04,00:07:39.04,">> Great, you guys, come on with us!"
104,00:07:47.21,00:07:47.21,">> Today, you will learn a traditional Fijian miki, a"
105,00:07:50.04,00:07:50.04,"dance. >> Oh, my god!"
106,00:07:52.42,00:07:52.42,>> The skilled Fijian dancers are here to teach you how to do
107,00:07:55.25,00:07:55.25,it. They will instruct you for two
108,00:07:57.25,00:07:57.25,hours. >> You will compete against the
109,00:07:59.08,00:07:59.08,other tribe this afternoon and try to outdance them at a local
110,00:08:01.71,00:08:01.71,village. The winners stay for a feast at
111,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,the village. >> It looks like we have a
112,00:08:07.29,00:08:07.29,dance-off competition with Ravu today.
113,00:08:10.58,00:08:10.58,And we had some Fijian dancers come and school us.
114,00:08:13.21,00:08:13.21,And then if we win we get a nice spread of food.
115,00:08:18.17,00:08:18.17,>> We have to sit one person out.
116,00:08:20.00,00:08:20.00,>> One person out. >> I'm all knees here when
117,00:08:21.75,00:08:21.75,"dancing. >> Well, you're sitting out."
118,00:08:23.46,00:08:23.46,">> When it comes to dancing, I have absolutely no rhythm."
119,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,I can't keep the beat if my life depends on it.
120,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> I got the moves. I got the moves.
121,00:08:44.38,00:08:44.38,"You know, I had to pull out some of my Michael Jackson moves, you"
122,00:08:46.21,00:08:46.21,"know? They put me up front, and I'm"
123,00:08:48.21,00:08:48.21,ready to take the lead. >> That's a little too much
124,00:08:53.88,00:08:53.88,"hips, Boo. >> It was funny seeing Boo, you"
125,00:08:56.58,00:08:56.58,know? Boo was doing the whole... the
126,00:08:59.00,00:08:59.00,"white guy thing. But he hung in there, and he's"
127,00:09:01.17,00:09:01.17,making a great effort at it. I think we'll be okay.
128,00:09:21.12,00:09:21.12,">> Size, strength, and agility is not necessarily going to be"
129,00:09:24.21,00:09:24.21,an advantage on this one. There's no way Yau-Man and those
130,00:09:27.04,00:09:27.04,girls are going to beat us at this.
131,00:09:29.00,00:09:29.00,"I mean, it's kind of frustrating, right?"
132,00:09:31.00,00:09:31.00,Because we've lost twice to a bunch of girls and an old guy.
133,00:09:33.25,00:09:33.25,"If we don't all work in unison, we don't eat."
134,00:09:38.83,00:09:38.83,>> ( speaking in Fijian language )
135,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,>> Okay. Okay.
136,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,">> Challenges, honestly, I don't take seriously."
137,00:09:48.38,00:09:48.38,"I don't think we should be out here brooding about ""We've got"
138,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,"to win,"" or ""We've got to eat that food!"""
139,00:09:55.00,00:09:55.00,"I mean, come on, guys. >> I really don't like Lisi."
140,00:10:07.92,00:10:07.92,Lisi was one of the reasons that I was so miserable at Moto.
141,00:10:10.83,00:10:10.83,Every challenge she's done has been horrible.
142,00:10:13.38,00:10:13.38,"So Lisi should be worried, because she's the weakest, and"
143,00:10:15.54,00:10:15.54,we're trying to get to the merge with numbers up.
144,00:10:17.67,00:10:17.67,"If we lose a challenge, she will be the next person voted off."
145,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,">> PROBST: Moto, come on in! Moto looking good."
146,00:10:56.25,00:10:56.25,"Ravu, come on in! Moto getting your first look at"
147,00:11:00.29,00:11:00.29,the new Ravu tribe. Rocky voted out at the last
148,00:11:03.50,00:11:03.50,tribal council. He became the first member of
149,00:11:06.25,00:11:06.25,the jury. Everybody go ahead and have a
150,00:11:09.25,00:11:09.25,seat. Glad to see everybody has
151,00:11:13.25,00:11:13.25,embraced today so far. >> For real.
152,00:11:17.25,00:11:17.25,>> PROBST: Are you guys ready to get to today's challenge?
153,00:11:19.12,00:11:19.12,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, this"
154,00:11:21.12,00:11:21.12,"morning you were taught a meke, which is a traditional dance."
155,00:11:24.58,00:11:24.58,Today you will get the opportunity to perform this meke
156,00:11:28.08,00:11:28.08,in front of some Fijian judges. You will be judged on three
157,00:11:32.42,00:11:32.42,"criteria-- your appearance, authenticity, and, of course,"
158,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,spirit. Did you embrace the dance?
159,00:11:42.21,00:11:42.21,Our judges are all experts in Fijian dance.
160,00:11:46.12,00:11:46.12,They will determine the winner. Want to know what you're playing
161,00:11:49.08,00:11:49.08,for? >> Yeah.
162,00:11:51.12,00:11:51.12,>> PROBST: Your reward is a Fijian feast-- it is cooking
163,00:11:55.54,00:11:55.54,"right now in a lovo-- of chicken, pork, seafood."
164,00:12:04.21,00:12:04.21,You'll also enjoy some nice Fijian singing.
165,00:12:06.42,00:12:06.42,"In addition, the winning tribe will send one member of the"
166,00:12:10.17,00:12:10.17,losing tribe to Exile Island. They will return in time for the
167,00:12:13.21,00:12:13.21,next immunity challenge. Shall we get to it?
168,00:12:16.33,00:12:16.33,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Moto, you have one"
169,00:12:18.29,00:12:18.29,extra tribe member. You had to decide this morning
170,00:12:20.33,00:12:20.33,"who was going to sit out. Based on how you guys look,"
171,00:12:23.08,00:12:23.08,I'm guessing it was Yau-Man. >> Yes.
172,00:12:25.92,00:12:25.92,">> PROBST: Moto, you are up. ( chanting )"
173,00:12:58.79,00:12:58.79,>> Meke! ( applause )
174,00:13:24.88,00:13:24.88,>> PROBST: Nicely done. Have a seat back on your mat.
175,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,"Ravu, the stage is yours. ( chanting )"
176,00:14:20.58,00:14:20.58,>> Argh! >> Argh!
177,00:14:24.25,00:14:24.25,( applause ) >> PROBST: Nicely done.
178,00:14:30.12,00:14:30.12,Have a seat. Give the judges a chance to
179,00:14:32.58,00:14:32.58,discuss. ( inaudible conversation )
180,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,"You guys have made a decision? >> Yes, Jeff."
181,00:14:48.71,00:14:48.71,">> PROBST: All right, tell me first about Moto."
182,00:14:50.38,00:14:50.38,What did they do well and what could they have improved on?
183,00:14:52.96,00:14:52.96,">> Moto, first of all, their appearance, as Ravu, is good,"
184,00:14:58.12,00:14:58.12,the way they dressed themselves up.
185,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,>> PROBST: So both tribes you thought did a good job?
186,00:15:02.25,00:15:02.25,">> Yes, they did a good job on their appearance."
187,00:15:04.25,00:15:04.25,And also the spirit on both teams were there.
188,00:15:08.33,00:15:08.33,>> PROBST: So you liked the appearance equally.
189,00:15:11.12,00:15:11.12,>> Yes. >> PROBST: And you liked spirit
190,00:15:13.33,00:15:13.33,equally? >> Yes.
191,00:15:15.29,00:15:15.29,">> PROBST: So it's going to come down, as it should, to how well"
192,00:15:17.58,00:15:17.58,they did the actual dance. >> Yes.
193,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,"The actual dance, for Moto, the group was... you know, they were"
194,00:15:24.96,00:15:24.96,better organized. And I think the leader was
195,00:15:28.67,00:15:28.67,"really good. Whereas Ravu, their body"
196,00:15:34.08,00:15:34.08,movement was out of rhythm with the chant.
197,00:15:38.92,00:15:38.92,They were either too fast again or behind in their actions.
198,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,"When it comes down to the final point of coordination, I think"
199,00:15:47.04,00:15:47.04,"Moto... >> PROBST: Judges, thank you"
200,00:16:01.00,00:16:01.00,"very much. First thing we have to do, Moto,"
201,00:16:04.46,00:16:04.46,somebody going directly to Exile Island.
202,00:16:06.88,00:16:06.88,Who is it going to be? >> Lisi.
203,00:16:09.88,00:16:09.88,>> PROBST: Lisi going back to Exile Island.
204,00:16:12.12,00:16:12.12,"Why Lisi, Earl? >> So no one else will get any"
205,00:16:14.00,00:16:14.00,"clues. >> All right, then."
206,00:16:17.67,00:16:17.67,">> PROBST: Lisi, the boat will pick you up."
207,00:16:19.46,00:16:19.46,You'll be back in time for the next immunity challenge.
208,00:16:21.67,00:16:21.67,"All right, Ravu. Unfortunately, I've got nothing"
209,00:16:23.54,00:16:23.54,"for you. Grab your stuff, head on back to"
210,00:16:25.42,00:16:25.42,"camp. Okay, Moto, you're going to"
211,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,enjoy an authentic Fijian feast that's been cooking for hours
212,00:16:38.08,00:16:38.08,"especially for you. Some singing, and it starts now."
213,00:16:44.92,00:16:44.92,">> One thing about being part of this game, we haven't had a"
214,00:16:46.79,00:16:46.79,"chance to experience what's here-- you know, the beauty of"
215,00:16:49.75,00:16:49.75,Fiji and the people and the natives.
216,00:16:51.62,00:16:51.62,We don't know anything. And that was the first time we
217,00:16:53.46,00:16:53.46,"got to actually absorb the culture, and that's fascinating"
218,00:16:55.88,00:16:55.88,"to me. >> Oh, my god!"
219,00:17:05.08,00:17:05.08,"It's so beautiful! >> My mouth is, like, watering"
220,00:17:11.67,00:17:11.67,right now. The feast was the one of the
221,00:17:14.25,00:17:14.25,most incredible things that I've ever experienced.
222,00:17:17.25,00:17:17.25,"There were huge lobsters. They had chicken, big pieces of"
223,00:17:20.54,00:17:20.54,papaya. We were eating with both our
224,00:17:23.25,00:17:23.25,"hands. It was just amazing-- the food,"
225,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,"the people, it was just incredible."
226,00:17:28.42,00:17:28.42,"Oh, my god, there's watermelon. >> True feast here, baby."
227,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17,">> Oh, my god, this is amazing. >> It was incredible."
228,00:17:36.08,00:17:36.08,These people have such huge hearts.
229,00:17:38.54,00:17:38.54,I don't think that any one of us will ever forget this for the
230,00:17:40.62,00:17:40.62,rest of our lives. >> A night like this brings us
231,00:17:51.04,00:17:51.04,"closer together, because we were still kind of separated."
232,00:17:53.96,00:17:53.96,"You know, it was still kind of some old Ravu and old Moto."
233,00:17:57.29,00:17:57.29,"I mean, we still hadn't connected all the way."
234,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,"And I think a celebration like this feels good as a group, that"
235,00:18:03.83,00:18:03.83,we can finally push forward and keep going as a solid group now.
236,00:18:07.17,00:18:07.17,"This time it's our turn in the sun, and I'm happy."
237,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> The game just gets so dark sometimes.
238,00:18:29.25,00:18:29.25,Ravu just can't seem to win even the simplest challenges.
239,00:18:32.46,00:18:32.46,This is kind of serious for someone that likes to take it
240,00:18:35.12,00:18:35.12,light. It sucks that I'm here.
241,00:18:42.62,00:18:42.62,"I mean, like, look at me-- I'm a moment away from crying."
242,00:18:45.25,00:18:45.25,I don't want to be here. This sucks.
243,00:18:48.29,00:18:48.29,"I really don't want to be here. But what am I supposed to do,"
244,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,man? This sucks.
245,00:18:57.00,00:18:57.00,There's only so much of this I can take.
246,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,"I don't want to let down Alex and Edgardo, but I feel like"
247,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,quitting. >> Michelle and I have our usual
248,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,"morning meetings, because I'm usually the first person up, and"
249,00:19:33.79,00:19:33.79,"then she gets up pretty soon, and everyone else is always just"
250,00:19:36.29,00:19:36.29,"laying there. So we always get up, and she"
251,00:19:38.71,00:19:38.71,"briefs me on what's happening, because she is my little spy."
252,00:19:41.79,00:19:41.79,"I think, Boo, if you put Boo in the right situation, he'll be"
253,00:19:46.46,00:19:46.46,"with us. >> Uh-huh, yeah."
254,00:19:48.96,00:19:48.96,">> But I still wasn't sure, because Cassandra said Boo is"
255,00:19:51.29,00:19:51.29,dangerous. If Boo makes the merger he'll be
256,00:19:53.71,00:19:53.71,the most dangerous. I don't know.
257,00:20:00.33,00:20:00.33,>> Stacy's got that fourth card. >> She wants to do that.
258,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,And that's what makes her a little more dangerous because
259,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,her vote's going to switch. >> That's why I feel like Stacy
260,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"first, because that will scare Boo and get him on our side."
261,00:20:11.04,00:20:11.04,>> Yeah. >> Earl and I are targeting
262,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,Stacy. She still does have ties on the
263,00:20:15.54,00:20:15.54,"other side, particularly with Alex."
264,00:20:18.46,00:20:18.46,"Ideally we'd want to get rid of Stacy before the merge, because"
265,00:20:21.12,00:20:21.12,that's when we feel like she'll be most dangerous.
266,00:20:23.79,00:20:23.79,>> One of those two has to go at the next immunity.
267,00:20:26.50,00:20:26.50,>> I feel like it will have to be Stacy.
268,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,"I am afraid that the longer Stacy sticks around, the more in"
269,00:20:32.08,00:20:32.08,"danger it put me, because me and Stacy are kind of carbon copies"
270,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83,of each other when it comes down to function.
271,00:20:39.62,00:20:39.62,I don't think there's enough room for the both of us.
272,00:20:44.71,00:20:44.71,>> We've got to get out of this losing spirit.
273,00:20:51.50,00:20:51.50,">> I'm feeling confident, still. I'm pretty sure tomorrow we're"
274,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,going to merge. >> Right now I'm really worried
275,00:21:06.46,00:21:06.46,"that Dreamz might be tight with Cassandra, and he might flip"
276,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,over. So I think I am going to keep my
277,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,eye on him because I know he is going to be a threat.
278,00:21:26.12,00:21:26.12,>> This is pretty cool. >> Interesting...
279,00:21:29.08,00:21:29.08,">> All right. ""Everybody gets their shot."
280,00:21:32.04,00:21:32.04,"It's immunity you desire. Ready, aim, make it count."
281,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,"Tonight, somebody loses fire."" >> We need the next immunity"
282,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,"bad. Going into a merge 4-6, much"
283,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,harder than 5-5. >> Ever shot a bow and arrow?
284,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,>> Yeah. >> I haven't.
285,00:21:47.29,00:21:47.29,>> It's all about keeping your arm straight.
286,00:21:49.29,00:21:49.29,">> When you release, you just release your backhand like that"
287,00:21:51.04,00:21:51.04,completely. >> I never say I'm pretty good
288,00:21:53.92,00:21:53.92,"at stuff, but I'm pretty good at archery, I think."
289,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,">> Go for the harder shots, whatever the hell they are."
290,00:21:58.04,00:21:58.04,>> I'm pretty sure of this challenge because have a lot of
291,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,confidence in my archery abilities.
292,00:22:02.21,00:22:02.21,"I've been kind of low key in all the challenges, just doing my"
293,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,"role, listening to people. And I feel like this is my time"
294,00:22:07.08,00:22:07.08,"to shine. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
295,00:22:22.38,00:22:22.38,We'll now bring in Lisi returning from Exile Island.
296,00:22:30.96,00:22:30.96,">> What's going on, kids? >> PROBST: You guys ready to get"
297,00:22:34.08,00:22:34.08,to today's immunity challenge? >> Let's do it.
298,00:22:35.92,00:22:35.92,>> PROBST: First things first. Take back the immunity idol.
299,00:22:38.58,00:22:38.58,"You've got to let it go. Once again, immunity is back up"
300,00:22:46.58,00:22:46.58,"for grabs. For today's immunity challenge,"
301,00:22:49.12,00:22:49.12,you will test your skills with three different weapons.
302,00:22:53.42,00:22:53.42,First round is blow darts. Each tribe member will get one
303,00:22:56.33,00:22:56.33,shot. Whoever ends up closest to the
304,00:22:59.04,00:22:59.04,bull's eye scores one point for their tribe.
305,00:23:02.33,00:23:02.33,"Second round, you will throw spears."
306,00:23:04.75,00:23:04.75,Closest to the bull's eye is worth two points.
307,00:23:07.38,00:23:07.38,"For the final round, you will shoot a bow and arrow."
308,00:23:11.29,00:23:11.29,Closest to the bull's eye scores three points for your tribe.
309,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,The tribe with the most points wins immunity.
310,00:23:18.21,00:23:18.21,"Losers will go to tribal council, and for somebody, the"
311,00:23:21.25,00:23:21.25,dream of winning this game will come to an end.
312,00:23:24.12,00:23:24.12,"Moto, you have one extra member. Who are you going to sit out?"
313,00:23:26.42,00:23:26.42,>> I will. >> PROBST: Cassandra takes a
314,00:23:28.75,00:23:28.75,"spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a"
315,00:23:30.79,00:23:30.79,minute to strategize and we'll get started.
316,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,First round is blow darts. Closer to the center of the
317,00:23:37.08,00:23:37.08,bull's eye scores a point for your tribe.
318,00:23:39.96,00:23:39.96,Lisi first up. She set the mark to beat.
319,00:23:45.42,00:23:45.42,Stacy up for Moto. Moto now has the mark to beat.
320,00:23:49.96,00:23:49.96,>> There you go! >> Yeah!
321,00:23:53.29,00:23:53.29,>> PROBST: Ravu up. Mookie just inside of Stacy's
322,00:23:55.62,00:23:55.62,dart. Ravu now has the mark to beat.
323,00:23:58.12,00:23:58.12,Moto back up. Not enough lung capacity.
324,00:24:02.38,00:24:02.38,Dreamz trying to improve on Mookie's shot.
325,00:24:06.04,00:24:06.04,And he does! Yau-Man with a nice shot!
326,00:24:14.04,00:24:14.04,Moto now has the mark to beat. Alex for Ravu.
327,00:24:19.04,00:24:19.04,Ravu back in the lead. First round has been back and
328,00:24:21.38,00:24:21.38,forth. Boo takes the lead back for
329,00:24:26.33,00:24:26.33,Moto! Comes down to Edgardo for Ravu.
330,00:24:31.75,00:24:31.75,"Ravu's last shot. If Edgardo doesn't get this,"
331,00:24:35.17,00:24:35.17,"Moto wins the round, Earl doesn't have to go."
332,00:24:44.21,00:24:44.21,And he does not. Moto wins first round and the
333,00:24:46.79,00:24:46.79,"first point. Next round, throwing spears."
334,00:24:58.04,00:24:58.04,This round is worth two points. Moto leads one point-zero.
335,00:25:03.92,00:25:03.92,Lisi does not get on the board for Ravu.
336,00:25:06.54,00:25:06.54,Moto. Ravu up.
337,00:25:11.17,00:25:11.17,Mookie going to try and set the mark.
338,00:25:13.58,00:25:13.58,Mookie takes a toss. That won't cut it.
339,00:25:16.54,00:25:16.54,"Target still wide open. Two-handed toss, made it halfway"
340,00:25:23.38,00:25:23.38,down the course. Ravu.
341,00:25:28.71,00:25:28.71,"Just barely on the target, but it will count."
342,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,Ravu now has the mark to beat. Boo just short.
343,00:25:36.88,00:25:36.88,Ravu still in the lead. Edgardo trying to improve the
344,00:25:42.08,00:25:42.08,mark set by his fellow tribemate Dreamz.
345,00:25:49.42,00:25:49.42,He does not. One good toss puts Moto back in
346,00:25:52.08,00:25:52.08,this. >> Damn it.
347,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,>> PROBST: Yau-Man heads over for Moto.
348,00:25:56.12,00:25:56.12,">> Come on, Yau-Man! Whoo!"
349,00:25:59.08,00:25:59.08,">> PROBST: A lot of target open there, Yau-Man."
350,00:26:05.54,00:26:05.54,"Yau-Man pulling an Evel Knievel, going way back."
351,00:26:15.79,00:26:15.79,And it works! Yau-Man sets the new mark to
352,00:26:19.00,00:26:19.00,beat. >> From the free throw line.
353,00:26:24.50,00:26:24.50,>> Michael Jordan! >> Look at that muscle!
354,00:26:29.62,00:26:29.62,>> PROBST: Alex is Ravu's last hope in this round.
355,00:26:33.54,00:26:33.54,Got to get inside the mark set by Yau-Man.
356,00:26:36.46,00:26:36.46,This round is worth two points. Moto leads one point-zero.
357,00:26:41.08,00:26:41.08,"If Alex doesn't beat Yau-Man's mark, Earl won't have to go in"
358,00:26:43.58,00:26:43.58,"this round, either. Alex ricochets off two targets,"
359,00:27:01.67,00:27:01.67,doesn't hit either one. Moto wins the second round.
360,00:27:10.29,00:27:10.29,"Moving on to the last round, bow and arrow."
361,00:27:14.08,00:27:14.08,Here's where we stand. Moto leads three-zip.
362,00:27:17.67,00:27:17.67,This round is worth three points.
363,00:27:19.96,00:27:19.96,"If Ravu wins this round and we are tied, we will go to sudden"
364,00:27:22.21,00:27:22.21,death. Sudden death will be with the
365,00:27:24.04,00:27:24.04,"bow and arrow, one shooter, one arrow, one winner."
366,00:27:27.25,00:27:27.25,"Ravu, you're up. Lisi not on the board for Ravu."
367,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,Moto. Stacy wide to the right.
368,00:27:37.08,00:27:37.08,"Ravu, you're up. Mookie would like to set a nice,"
369,00:27:43.29,00:27:43.29,tough mark for Moto to beat. And he does not.
370,00:27:50.08,00:27:50.08,The target is still wide open. Moto.
371,00:27:55.83,00:27:55.83,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Michelle just barely
372,00:27:57.88,00:27:57.88,"on the target. Ravu, you're up."
373,00:28:01.92,00:28:01.92,Ravu now has the mark to beat. Boo up for Moto.
374,00:28:07.75,00:28:07.75,Ravu still in the lead. Alex up for Ravu.
375,00:28:15.12,00:28:15.12,That won't cut it. >> Oh!
376,00:28:21.50,00:28:21.50,>> PROBST: Yau-Man. What kind of move will he have
377,00:28:24.96,00:28:24.96,"with the bow and arrow? Yau-Man, what are you possibly"
378,00:28:27.83,00:28:27.83,looking for? >> The straightest possible
379,00:28:31.17,00:28:31.17,"arrow. >> Come on, Yau!"
380,00:28:36.25,00:28:36.25,>> PROBST: Yau-Man once again brings his own style.
381,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,Yau-Man takes the lead for Moto. It comes down to Edgardo for
382,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,Ravu. Ravu needs to win this round to
383,00:29:01.62,00:29:01.62,"force a tie. Otherwise Moto wins immunity,"
384,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,and Earl will not have to participate in this challenge at
385,00:29:07.50,00:29:07.50,all. >> PROBST: Moto wins immunity!
386,00:29:41.21,00:29:41.21,"Moto, congratulations. The new Moto tribe has not lost"
387,00:29:44.12,00:29:44.12,"immunity. Ravu, once again, you have a"
388,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,date with me at tribal council. One of the five of you going
389,00:29:52.21,00:29:52.21,"home. Grab your stuff, head back to"
390,00:29:54.25,00:29:54.25,camp. >> How do we do so horrible?
391,00:30:34.08,00:30:34.08,We did bad. >> I'm done with the losers.
392,00:30:41.04,00:30:41.04,These guys can't pull it together.
393,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,Can I just say loser? Loo-oo-ser.
394,00:30:48.38,00:30:48.38,I'm surrounded by losers. You know what's going on?
395,00:30:51.29,00:30:51.29,"That they know that they suck. And when you know you suck, you"
396,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,"suck. Dude, I'm telling you, this"
397,00:30:56.17,00:30:56.17,whole tribe is a sinking ship. There was no reason for you guys
398,00:31:01.46,00:31:01.46,"to lose today. Quite frankly, I don't see you"
399,00:31:05.04,00:31:05.04,"guys winning the next reward challenge, and that means I get"
400,00:31:08.33,00:31:08.33,to go to Exile Island again. I'm not trying to buy real
401,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,"estate, dude, you know what I'm saying?"
402,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,>> I understand. >> I just really feel like my
403,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,"time is up, and before I drive myself crazy, I'd rather just"
404,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,"let you guys know how I'm feeling, you know?"
405,00:31:21.08,00:31:21.08,>> I just don't understand. >> Lisi decided today that she
406,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,wants to be the next one to go. She says she's had the
407,00:31:31.42,00:31:31.42,"experience she wants to have, and is grateful that Ed and I"
408,00:31:34.17,00:31:34.17,"kept her safe for as long as we did, and it's just done, so she"
409,00:31:37.21,00:31:37.21,"told us she wants to go next. >> I don't know what went awry,"
410,00:31:41.00,00:31:41.00,"you know? >> I ran the gamut in this game,"
411,00:31:43.42,00:31:43.42,"I've been rich, I've been poor, I've been in exile."
412,00:31:46.21,00:31:46.21,What more have I got to do? I'm going to cry.
413,00:31:49.25,00:31:49.25,Oh! >> The fact that Lisi wants to
414,00:31:52.38,00:31:52.38,quit pissed me off because I could probably use her in the
415,00:31:55.79,00:31:55.79,"future, because she's a solid vote, but hey, I try not to"
416,00:31:58.42,00:31:58.42,judge people in life. I'm not going to judge Lisi now.
417,00:32:01.42,00:32:01.42,">> I knew if I talked to you guys, you guys probably wouldn't"
418,00:32:03.96,00:32:03.96,"have voted me off, you know? And that to me is like... I"
419,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,don't know. It's amazing.
420,00:32:09.71,00:32:09.71,"It's amazing, and it's something that's going to be treasured"
421,00:32:12.04,00:32:12.04,"forever. We're going to be friends, end"
422,00:32:14.25,00:32:14.25,"of story, no more crying. Sometimes you have to know when"
423,00:32:16.54,00:32:16.54,it's time to go. And I just kind of feel like
424,00:32:19.08,00:32:19.08,it's the end of the game for me. I've gotten further than I ever
425,00:32:22.46,00:32:22.46,"thought I would get, and I just don't see the need to push"
426,00:32:25.54,00:32:25.54,myself any further. I'm done like a Thanksgiving day
427,00:32:28.79,00:32:28.79,"turkey, man-- I'm done. But it's cool, it's cool."
428,00:32:49.38,00:32:49.38,"Well, we have tribal council tonight, and pretty much, Lisi's"
429,00:32:51.83,00:32:51.83,gone. She's just laying there like
430,00:32:54.50,00:32:54.50,"she's a sad puppy, so it's time for her to go."
431,00:32:57.21,00:32:57.21,Getting rid of her is a dream come true for me.
432,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,"I don't know how the rest of the boys feel about it, but I'm so"
433,00:33:03.21,00:33:03.21,"happy. At tribal council, I might not"
434,00:33:05.12,00:33:05.12,"even be paying attention, Jeff will be talking, and I'll"
435,00:33:06.62,00:33:06.62,just get up and start taking votes myself.
436,00:33:19.50,00:33:19.50,">> Going into tribal council, I'm not going to take my bags."
437,00:33:22.04,00:33:22.04,I'm just going to tribal council because I got plans on coming
438,00:33:24.08,00:33:24.08,back. >> What would happen if we kept
439,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,on going? >> I don't know.
440,00:33:38.29,00:33:38.29,"What do you want me to say? >> Look, I'm just thinking a"
441,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,"little bit more, that's all. I'm having second thoughts."
442,00:33:44.00,00:33:44.00,"All I can say is I was sitting here thinking, and I was"
443,00:33:47.08,00:33:47.08,"thinking some more, and that's why I pulled you guys over."
444,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,">> Okay, Lisi changed her mind again."
445,00:33:52.17,00:33:52.17,"I mean, she's gone back and forth, like, three times."
446,00:33:54.42,00:33:54.42,"So, I mean, I throw my hands up in despair as if to say, ""What"
447,00:33:57.25,00:33:57.25,"the hell?"" >> Okay, I'm looking at all"
448,00:34:00.25,00:34:00.25,"options. Help me out here, guys."
449,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,"Hello! Alex and Edgardo, they know me."
450,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,The three of us are probably the tightest three people in this
451,00:34:07.46,00:34:07.46,game. And we've all had moments where
452,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,"we've been at the brink, and then something has pushed us"
453,00:34:13.79,00:34:13.79,away or... but we've just kept on playing.
454,00:34:33.17,00:34:33.17,>> Tonight we have to go to tribal council and vote somebody
455,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,"out. So I mean, is it Lisi or Dreamz?"
456,00:34:38.12,00:34:38.12,We haven't decided who's going to be the target.
457,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,"And that worries me a little bit, but, I mean, you have to do"
458,00:34:42.12,00:34:42.12,"what you have to do. >> In my eyes, Dreamz should be"
459,00:34:47.67,00:34:47.67,"the next one to go tonight. I would vote for him, Alex would"
460,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,"vote for him, Edgardo would vote for him."
461,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,"So that's three votes. Mookie's going to vote for me,"
462,00:34:56.46,00:34:56.46,and Dreamz will vote for me as well.
463,00:34:58.42,00:34:58.42,So Dreamz is going to end up coming out of this.
464,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
465,00:35:27.83,00:35:27.83,"Rocky, voted out at the last tribal council."
466,00:35:31.96,00:35:31.96,"I'll remind you, the jury is here merely to observe, listen"
467,00:35:35.21,00:35:35.21,"in, gather information to help make a very big decision."
468,00:35:39.79,00:35:39.79,"Since this new tribe formed, you've lost four out of five"
469,00:35:42.54,00:35:42.54,"challenges. Lisi, what's missing in this"
470,00:35:44.62,00:35:44.62,"tribe? >> Well, there seems to be a lot"
471,00:35:47.54,00:35:47.54,of individualism happening here. The group cannot come together
472,00:35:51.67,00:35:51.67,"as a cohesive force, and that's how you see the other tribe"
473,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,winning. >> PROBST: You've had an
474,00:35:58.08,00:35:58.08,"emotional ride. >> Yeah, you could say that"
475,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,"again. I mean, I've run the gamut in"
476,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,"this game. I've been rich, I've been poor,"
477,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,I've been in exile. I've been all over the board.
478,00:36:07.71,00:36:07.71,"So yeah, I've played this game. There's no question about that."
479,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,">> PROBST: Dreamz, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
480,00:36:15.12,00:36:15.12,>> You want me to be honest? I think Lisi wants to go home
481,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,because she's not winning like she was at the old Moto.
482,00:36:20.42,00:36:20.42,"She gives up easily. It's not hard to see that, Jeff."
483,00:36:23.46,00:36:23.46,>> I've seen you give up in the middle of a challenge.
484,00:36:25.88,00:36:25.88,>> You've never see me give up. >> Okay.
485,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,>> In your life you'll never see me give up.
486,00:36:30.12,00:36:30.12,I can't give up. It's not in me.
487,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,It can't be in me. >> I've seen you not pull
488,00:36:33.79,00:36:33.79,"through when it was time to, like, pull through, like to"
489,00:36:35.88,00:36:35.88,bring out the stuff from underneath you.
490,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,">> When? >> I saw you... okay, I can't"
491,00:36:39.29,00:36:39.29,"even do this, man. >> Like I said, Jeff, I think"
492,00:36:43.04,00:36:43.04,"she wants to go home, and they call me a genie in the bottle,"
493,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,"because I grant wishes. >> PROBST: So Lisi, what is the"
494,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,"status of your will, your desire?"
495,00:36:53.67,00:36:53.67,">> It's, quite frankly, wavering from minute to minute."
496,00:36:58.12,00:36:58.12,Sometimes I feel like there's hope and sometimes I feel like
497,00:37:02.04,00:37:02.04,"we're doomed. >> PROBST: Edgardo, how do you"
498,00:37:06.42,00:37:06.42,go and trust somebody who's been so vocal about their uncertainty
499,00:37:10.42,00:37:10.42,"in this game? >> Well, based on the talks that"
500,00:37:13.71,00:37:13.71,"I have with Lisi, Lisi and I don't have anything to hide from"
501,00:37:16.17,00:37:16.17,each other. She's told me everything.
502,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"I mean, winning a lot, then losing a lot, then being on"
503,00:37:20.71,00:37:20.71,Exile Island has affected the way she's viewing the game.
504,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,">> PROBST: Dreamz, yes or no, has your will dipped?"
505,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,>> I'm glad you asked that. My will is so opposite of hers.
506,00:37:30.04,00:37:30.04,"Because I will fight. You get what I'm saying, Jeff?"
507,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,"If I die, resuscitate me at the finish line, you know what I"
508,00:37:34.67,00:37:34.67,"mean? The warriors that I fight with,"
509,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,we don't think we lose because we suck.
510,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,So our spirit don't go down. Her spirit goes down.
511,00:37:42.46,00:37:42.46,">> PROBST: So, Lisi, do you want to be here?"
512,00:37:45.75,00:37:45.75,">> Can't I catch a break? I mean, there are times where"
513,00:37:49.88,00:37:49.88,you're just not up to it. I'm just being honest.
514,00:37:53.08,00:37:53.08,">> Well, I'm sorry, Jeff, I really didn't get the answer to"
515,00:37:55.79,00:37:55.79,"that question, do she want to be here."
516,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,"She kind of moved around it, and I didn't understand it at all."
517,00:38:00.58,00:38:00.58,Can you ask her again? >> PROBST: You just did.
518,00:38:07.29,00:38:07.29,>> What? >> Do you want to be here?
519,00:38:09.42,00:38:09.42,">> Okay... >> It's a yes or no question,"
520,00:38:12.00,00:38:12.00,"Lis. Do you want to be here, Alex?"
521,00:38:13.62,00:38:13.62,">> Yes. >> Do you want to be here,"
522,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,Edgardo? >> You know it.
523,00:38:16.88,00:38:16.88,">> Do you want to be here, Mookie?"
524,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,See how simple their answers were?
525,00:38:19.88,00:38:19.88,">> Okay, that's fine. >> They didn't give me a"
526,00:38:21.42,00:38:21.42,shalingua... shiquare... >> PROBST: Soliloquy?
527,00:38:23.21,00:38:23.21,>> Yeah. They didn't give me one of
528,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,"those. >> All right, so I'm at fault"
529,00:38:27.04,00:38:27.04,"for being honest and saying I have to think for a minute, I"
530,00:38:29.17,00:38:29.17,"have to just chill? >> Jeff, I'm ready to vote."
531,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,">> PROBST: So Lisi, because we have a vote about to happen,"
532,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,what would you advise your tribe to do?
533,00:38:40.25,00:38:40.25,">> Just give me a chance. I mean, Edgardo and Alex know"
534,00:38:43.79,00:38:43.79,"me. Dreamz, whether he wants to"
535,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,admit that he knows me or not is another story.
536,00:38:49.04,00:38:49.04,>> It's not that. >> He's seen me around.
537,00:38:50.88,00:38:50.88,"Okay, now I'm talking, okay, now I'm talking!"
538,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,"So, you know, he's seen me around, and he can judge my"
539,00:38:55.54,00:38:55.54,"actions, what have you. Just give me a chance."
540,00:38:58.71,00:38:58.71,"Just let me see what happens. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"
541,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,the vote. If anybody has the hidden
542,00:39:08.33,00:39:08.33,"immunity idol and you want to play it, you would present it to"
543,00:39:10.46,00:39:10.46,me before I read the votes. It is time to vote.
544,00:39:13.38,00:39:13.38,"Mookie, you're up. >> I've been waiting to do this"
545,00:39:27.21,00:39:27.21,for a long time. >> You're a grown man.
546,00:39:39.38,00:39:39.38,Consider a name change. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
547,00:39:58.42,00:39:58.42,votes. If anybody has the hidden
548,00:40:12.75,00:40:12.75,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
549,00:40:14.79,00:40:14.79,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
550,00:40:21.33,00:40:21.33,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
551,00:40:23.25,00:40:23.25,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
552,00:40:25.58,00:40:25.58,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Lisi."
553,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,"Dreamz. One vote Lisi, one vote Dreamz."
554,00:40:41.25,00:40:41.25,"Lisi. Two votes Lisi, one vote Dreamz."
