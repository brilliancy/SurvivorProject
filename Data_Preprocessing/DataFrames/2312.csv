449,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,HE WAS SITTING THERE...
450,00:15:55.23,00:15:55.23,"BYE, EDNA."
451,00:15:57.10,00:15:57.10,BYE.
452,00:16:09.70,00:16:09.70,"YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO."
453,00:16:12.70,00:16:12.70,ALBERT PROCEEDED TO LAY IN
454,00:16:14.30,00:16:14.30,THE HAMMOCK AND WATCH ME FOR TWO
455,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,"HOURS WHILE I DID THE LAUNDRY,"
456,00:16:17.53,00:16:17.53,AND WHEN I STEPPED AWAY FROM THE

458,00:16:20.50,00:16:20.50,BACK TO THE FIRE BEING DOUSED
459,00:16:22.63,00:16:22.63,"OUT, AND THE EMBERS ARE WET AND"
460,00:16:24.53,00:16:24.53,YOU CAN'T GET THE FIRE STARTED
461,00:16:25.90,00:16:25.90,THAT EASILY.
462,00:16:26.87,00:16:26.87,"OH, THAT WAS SO INFURIATING."
463,00:16:29.53,00:16:29.53,ALBERT DOES PRETTY MUCH NOTHING
464,00:16:31.73,00:16:31.73,EXCEPT LIE AROUND AND EAT FISH
465,00:16:33.10,00:16:33.10,AND WAIT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO
466,00:16:34.23,00:16:34.23,WAIT ON HIM.
467,00:16:36.10,00:16:36.10,I DON'T THINK ALBERT HAS DONE
468,00:16:39.90,00:16:39.90,A DAY OF WORK IN HIS LIFE.
469,00:16:41.27,00:16:41.27,I THINK THAT BOTH HAS BEEN
470,00:16:43.73,00:16:43.73,"HAND-CLOTHED, HAND-BATHED BY HIS"
471,00:16:45.23,00:16:45.23,MOTHER SINCE HE WAS TWO.
472,00:16:48.13,00:16:48.13,HE JUST LITERALLY STAY ON THE
473,00:16:50.13,00:16:50.13,HAMMOCK FOR TWO HOURS AND SO NOW
474,00:16:52.10,00:16:52.10,"I WAS LIKE THERE'S NO FIRE, THE"
475,00:16:55.33,00:16:55.33,LAUNDRY IS NOT DONE AND ALBERT
476,00:16:57.43,00:16:57.43,HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.
477,00:16:58.67,00:16:58.67,HE LITERALLY SAT THERE.
478,00:17:02.30,00:17:02.30,ALBERT IS A KIND OF PRECIOUS
479,00:17:03.90,00:17:03.90,THING IN CAMP.
480,00:17:04.63,00:17:04.63,HE'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE BARBIE
481,00:17:06.60,00:17:06.60,DOLLS.
482,00:17:07.00,00:17:07.00,THEY LOOK CUTE BECAUSE THEY
483,00:17:08.40,00:17:08.40,DON'T DO DO ANYTHING AND SIT
484,00:17:11.33,00:17:11.33,THERE.
485,00:17:11.73,00:17:11.73,THAT'S WHY I CALL HIM PRINCE
486,00:17:13.17,00:17:13.17,ALBERT.
487,00:17:13.57,00:17:13.57,IT'S LIKE I'M THE PRINCE AND YOU
488,00:17:15.23,00:17:15.23,GUYS WORK FOR ME.
489,00:17:17.63,00:17:17.63,IT JUST KILLS ME.
490,00:17:18.67,00:17:18.67,TELL ME I'M BASICALLY NEXT
491,00:17:21.93,00:17:21.93,PERSON TO GO AFTER COCHRAN.
492,00:17:24.10,00:17:24.10,IS THAT STILL TRUE?
493,00:17:25.53,00:17:25.53,"I THINK SO, YES."
494,00:17:27.23,00:17:27.23,WHY?
495,00:17:28.90,00:17:28.90,BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO START
496,00:17:30.77,00:17:30.77,PICKING EVERYBODY OFF ONE ON
497,00:17:31.97,00:17:31.97,ONE.
498,00:17:32.37,00:17:32.37,"I KNOW, BUT WHY AM I NEXT?"
499,00:17:37.10,00:17:37.10,I FOUND OUT I'M BASICALLY THE
500,00:17:38.93,00:17:38.93,NEXT PERSON TO GO AFTER COCHRAN
501,00:17:41.10,00:17:41.10,WHICH MAKES ME FEEL AS THOUGH I
502,00:17:42.23,00:17:42.23,AM PRETTY LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE.
503,00:17:44.23,00:17:44.23,I DEFINITELY HAVE TO SHAKE IT UP
504,00:17:45.60,00:17:45.60,RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SIXTH OR
505,00:17:48.00,00:17:48.00,SEVENTH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR
506,00:17:50.43,00:17:50.43,ME.
507,00:17:50.90,00:17:50.90,"DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, ANY"
508,00:17:53.00,00:17:53.00,IDEAS?
509,00:17:53.50,00:17:53.50,"WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, COACH?"
510,00:17:56.97,00:17:56.97,MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'RE AT A
511,00:17:59.70,00:17:59.70,CONSENSUS THAT COOK RAN IS NEXT?
512,00:18:03.17,00:18:03.17,YES.
513,00:18:08.00,00:18:08.00,KEEPING EDNA AND COCHRAN WOULD
514,00:18:09.77,00:18:09.77,BE THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO
515,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO
516,00:18:12.33,00:18:12.33,VOTE ME OUT SO IT'S REALLY LIKE
517,00:18:14.00,00:18:14.00,A CATCH-22.

519,00:18:16.40,00:18:16.40,POINT.
520,00:18:16.83,00:18:16.83,"DO I WANT TO HONOR MY WORD, BE A"
521,00:18:19.13,00:18:19.13,"MAN OF INTEGRITY, STICK WITH THE"
522,00:18:20.80,00:18:20.80,FIVE OR DO I WANT TO GO ANOTHER
523,00:18:22.47,00:18:22.47,ROUTE?

860,00:29:28.37,00:29:28.37,THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK
861,00:29:29.37,00:29:29.37,HE'S READY TO MAKE A HUGE MOVE
862,00:29:30.87,00:29:30.87,"THAT WOULD BE GETTING RID OF,"
863,00:29:32.93,00:29:32.93,"LIKE, A RICK--"
864,00:29:33.83,00:29:33.83,I KNOW HE IS.
865,00:29:35.47,00:29:35.47,I KNOW FOR A FACT HE IS.
866,00:29:36.67,00:29:36.67,YOU THINK SO?
867,00:29:37.83,00:29:37.83,NO QUESTION.
868,00:29:39.30,00:29:39.30,COACH WILL VOTE OUT RICK.
869,00:29:41.40,00:29:41.40,HE CALLS HIM PRINCESS ALBERT.
870,00:29:43.93,00:29:43.93,WHEN DID YOU HEAR THAT?
871,00:29:45.23,00:29:45.23,AROUND THE FIRE YESTERDAY.
872,00:29:46.77,00:29:46.77,"LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU I'M NOT--"
873,00:29:48.67,00:29:48.67,"OBVIOUSLY, I'M IN SURVIVAL MODE"
874,00:29:50.23,00:29:50.23,"RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M TELLING YOU"
875,00:29:52.60,00:29:52.60,100%.
876,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY IT
877,00:29:54.27,00:29:54.27,WOULD MAKE ME TO SEE YOU GO
878,00:29:56.93,00:29:56.93,FATHER THAN RICK IN THIS GAME.
879,00:29:58.23,00:29:58.23,IT COULD MAKE ME ECSTATIC.
880,00:30:00.07,00:30:00.07,"RICK, TO BEGIN WITH, HE'S"
881,00:30:02.00,00:30:02.00,ABOUT AS SMART AS A BOWLING
882,00:30:03.63,00:30:03.63,"BALL, AND THEN I HEAR HE'S"
883,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,"CHIRPING IN THE BACKGROUND,"
884,00:30:06.00,00:30:06.00,"CALLING ME NAMES, DROPPING A"
885,00:30:06.90,00:30:06.90,PRINCESS HERE AND THERE.
886,00:30:07.80,00:30:07.80,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME, RICK?"
887,00:30:09.27,00:30:09.27,I HAVE A MIND TO GET RID OF RICK
888,00:30:11.73,00:30:11.73,ON THIS VOTE.
889,00:30:12.80,00:30:12.80,I JUST DON'T KNOW IF HE'D DO IT.
890,00:30:15.10,00:30:15.10,I PROMISE YOU THIS-- IF HE DOES
891,00:30:16.63,00:30:16.63,"IT, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, 100%."
892,00:30:27.20,00:30:27.20,HE'S PISSED OFF AT RICK NOW
893,00:30:29.57,00:30:29.57,BECAUSE HE HEARD ABOUT THE
894,00:30:31.40,00:30:31.40,PRINCESS ALBERT.
895,00:30:32.07,00:30:32.07,THAT ANNOYS HIM A LOT.
896,00:30:33.07,00:30:33.07,GOOD.
897,00:30:33.63,00:30:33.63,HE WANTS TO VOTE OUT RICK.
898,00:30:35.60,00:30:35.60,DUDE.
899,00:30:35.97,00:30:35.97,I'M ON BOARD.
900,00:30:38.37,00:30:38.37,ALBERT CAUGHT WIND THAT RICK WAS
901,00:30:40.47,00:30:40.47,"CALLING HIM PRINCESS ALBERT,"
902,00:30:42.07,00:30:42.07,PRINCE ALBERT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
903,00:30:44.27,00:30:44.27,DO ANYTHING AROUND CAMP.
904,00:30:46.00,00:30:46.00,COCHRAN AND I TRYING TO USE THAT
905,00:30:48.37,00:30:48.37,INFORMATION TO TRY TO GET COACH
906,00:30:49.60,00:30:49.60,TO COME WITH US TO VOTE RICK
907,00:30:52.27,00:30:52.27,OFF.
908,00:30:52.77,00:30:52.77,I FEEL LIKE IF WE DON'T USE YOU
909,00:30:54.13,00:30:54.13,"TO OUR MAXIMUM BENEFIT, PART OF"
910,00:30:56.43,00:30:56.43,THE REASON WE WON THAT LAST
911,00:30:58.03,00:30:58.03,GROUP CHALLENGE AND WERE 6-6
912,00:31:00.83,00:31:00.83,INTO THE MERGE IS BECAUSE OF
913,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,YOU.
914,00:31:02.83,00:31:02.83,I THINK THAT WE OWE YOU MORE OF
915,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,"A, YOU KNOW, DEBT."
916,00:31:06.10,00:31:06.10,I LIKE YOU.
917,00:31:07.00,00:31:07.00,I LIKE COACH.
918,00:31:07.87,00:31:07.87,YEAH.
919,00:31:09.20,00:31:09.20,"I LIKE YOU, TOO."
920,00:31:16.40,00:31:16.40,I TALKED TO ALBERT.
921,00:31:19.03,00:31:19.03,HE GAVE ME THIS WHOLE SPIEL IT'S
922,00:31:24.13,00:31:24.13,NOT LOOKING SO GOOD.
923,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,MY DECISION TONIGHT AND WHICH
924,00:31:57.53,00:31:57.53,WAY I GO IS GOING TO DETERMINE
925,00:31:59.50,00:31:59.50,THE REST OF THIS GAME.
926,00:32:02.73,00:32:02.73,THERE IS A TIDE THAT IS COMING.
927,00:32:06.03,00:32:06.03,I EITHER TAKE IT AND GO WITH A
928,00:32:10.10,00:32:10.10,"NEW ALLIANCE, OR STAY WITH MY"
929,00:32:14.50,00:32:14.50,FIRST FIVE.
930,00:32:16.80,00:32:16.80,"AS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE SAYS,"
931,00:32:18.00,00:32:18.00,THERE'S A TIDE THAT COMES IN THE
932,00:32:19.27,00:32:19.27,"LIVES OF MEN THAT WHEN TAKEN,"
933,00:32:22.27,00:32:22.27,LEADS TO GREAT FORTUNE.
934,00:32:23.90,00:32:23.90,"BUT WHEN OMIDST IT, ALL THE REST"
935,00:32:26.40,00:32:26.40,OF THEIR LIVES ARE BOUND IN
936,00:32:29.43,00:32:29.43,SHADOWS AND MISERY.
937,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I MAKE
938,00:32:34.27,00:32:34.27,THE RIGHT DECISION.
939,00:32:35.27,00:32:35.27,I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY TAKE
940,00:32:36.97,00:32:36.97,THE RIGHT TIDE SO THAT I CAN
941,00:32:38.60,00:32:38.60,RIDE THAT TIDE ALL THE WAY TO
942,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,THE END OF THIS GAME THAT I LOVE
943,00:32:41.47,00:32:41.47,SO DEARLY.
944,00:33:05.23,00:33:05.23,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
945,00:33:06.47,00:33:06.47,THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
946,00:33:10.13,00:33:10.13,JIM.
947,00:33:11.23,00:33:11.23,KEITH.
948,00:33:12.07,00:33:12.07,DAWN.
949,00:33:12.20,00:33:12.20,AND WHITNEY.
950,00:33:20.47,00:33:20.47,"COACH, WHERE DOES THIS RANK IN"
951,00:33:21.67,00:33:21.67,TERMS OF ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
952,00:33:24.03,00:33:24.03,THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH TONIGHT'S
953,00:33:25.90,00:33:25.90,VOTE?
954,00:33:26.33,00:33:26.33,I THINK THE POSSIBILITIES ARE
955,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,ENDLESS.
956,00:33:27.97,00:33:27.97,"I MEAN, THEY REALLY ARE BECAUSE"
957,00:33:29.70,00:33:29.70,NOBODY REALLY KNOWS IF THEY'RE
958,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,"GOING TO THE FINAL THREE, IF"
959,00:33:32.87,00:33:32.87,"THEY'RE FOUR, FIVE, SIX, OR"
960,00:33:35.07,00:33:35.07,SEVEN.
961,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,THERE'S A NEW SCENARIO THAT'S
962,00:33:36.77,00:33:36.77,PRESENTED TO ME AND ALBERT AND
963,00:33:38.73,00:33:38.73,EVERYBODY HERE EVERY HOUR.
964,00:33:40.57,00:33:40.57,IT'S BEEN CRAZY.
965,00:33:41.83,00:33:41.83,"Jeff: COCHRAN, DID YOU FEEL"
966,00:33:43.47,00:33:43.47,THE SCRAMBLING HAPPENING TODAY?
967,00:33:44.57,00:33:44.57,"OH, ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I TOOK"
968,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,PART IN IT.
969,00:33:46.93,00:33:46.93,I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO FILL THE
970,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,JURY WITH GLEE TO DISCOVER I'M
971,00:33:51.03,00:33:51.03,PROBABLY IN GREAT DANGER
972,00:33:52.00,00:33:52.00,"TONIGHT, AND I FEEL LIKE AN"
973,00:33:53.80,00:33:53.80,IDIOT KIND OF.
974,00:33:55.10,00:33:55.10,I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND GREEDY BUT
975,00:33:57.13,00:33:57.13,I'M HERE TO COLLECT A DEBT.
976,00:33:58.57,00:33:58.57,I GAVE LIFE TO THIS TRIED AND TO
977,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,BE TARGETED FOR SEVENTH IT'S A
978,00:34:01.93,00:34:01.93,LITTLE BIT HUMILIATING.
979,00:34:03.57,00:34:03.57,I FEEL A LITTLE BIT DUPED.
980,00:34:05.10,00:34:05.10,THE MASSAGE WAS ONE NICE WAY OF
981,00:34:06.70,00:34:06.70,PAYING OFF THE DEBT BUT I FEEL
982,00:34:08.63,00:34:08.63,LIKE I'M ENTITLED TO AT LEAST
983,00:34:10.50,00:34:10.50,ONE MORE NIGHT IN THIS GAME.
984,00:34:11.93,00:34:11.93,JUST TO COMMENT ON THAT POINT
985,00:34:14.10,00:34:14.10,I VOCALIZE TO THE TRIBE I
986,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,THOUGHT IT'S NOT IN THE BEST
987,00:34:16.97,00:34:16.97,"INTEREST OF OUR QUOTE, UNQUOTE"
988,00:34:20.17,00:34:20.17,"IMAGE, TO USE AND ABUSE SOMEONE,"
989,00:34:21.47,00:34:21.47,AND I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION
990,00:34:23.13,00:34:23.13,"OF GIVING HIM THE REWARD, AND I"
991,00:34:24.57,00:34:24.57,DON'T WANT HIM TO REGRET HIS
992,00:34:26.47,00:34:26.47,DECISION.
993,00:34:26.70,00:34:26.70,"Jeff: COACH, DOES IT"
994,00:34:27.37,00:34:27.37,CONCERN YOU A LITTLE WHEN YOU
995,00:34:29.23,00:34:29.23,"HAVE ALBERT SAYING, ""I THINK"
996,00:34:30.93,00:34:30.93,"COCHRAN'S RIGHT?"""
997,00:34:31.70,00:34:31.70,"AS EVERYBODY KNOWS, WE'RE IN"
998,00:34:33.33,00:34:33.33,THIS GOOD STANDING BECAUSE
999,00:34:35.20,00:34:35.20,COCHRAN MADE A MOVE THAT SOME
1000,00:34:38.17,00:34:38.17,PEOPLE CONSIDERED COWARDICE.
1001,00:34:40.00,00:34:40.00,"OTHERS, INCLUDING MYSELF,"
1002,00:34:41.47,00:34:41.47,THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BOLD AND
1003,00:34:43.90,00:34:43.90,COURAGEOUS.
1004,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20,"Jeff: RICK, ARE YOU WORRIED"
1005,00:34:45.77,00:34:45.77,AT ALL IF COCHRAN DOES PLAY HIS
1006,00:34:47.73,00:34:47.73,CARD TONIGHT THAT MEANS IT'S ONE
1007,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,OF THE OTHER SIX?
1008,00:34:50.27,00:34:50.27,"OH, ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IT'S A"
1009,00:34:52.00,00:34:52.00,"MILLION BUCKS, YEAH."
1010,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,I'VE GOT MY BAGS PACKED.
1011,00:34:55.27,00:34:55.27,"I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO, BUT,"
1012,00:34:57.47,00:34:57.47,YEAH.
1013,00:34:57.73,00:34:57.73,"Jeff: EDNA, ARE YOU"
1014,00:34:59.47,00:34:59.47,EMOTIONAL TONIGHT OR ARE YOU--
1015,00:35:01.03,00:35:01.03,"YEAH, I'M A LITTLE EMOTIONAL"
1016,00:35:02.67,00:35:02.67,"BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SIXTH,"
1017,00:35:04.37,00:35:04.37,"YOU KNOW, THE PERCEPTION THAT"
1018,00:35:05.87,00:35:05.87,THE SIX WERE EQUAL.
1019,00:35:07.00,00:35:07.00,THAT WAS A DELUSION.
1020,00:35:08.47,00:35:08.47,I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WAS
1021,00:35:10.03,00:35:10.03,"EQUAL IN CERTAIN PEOPLE'S MINDS,"
1022,00:35:12.23,00:35:12.23,WE WEREN'T.
1023,00:35:12.57,00:35:12.57,Jeff: SO YOUR EMOTION IS
1024,00:35:13.87,00:35:13.87,"ANGER, HURT, SADNESS?"
1025,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,SADNESS.
1026,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY BEEN
1027,00:35:19.30,00:35:19.30,"DECEIVED LEADING UP TO HERE,"
1028,00:35:21.20,00:35:21.20,"LIKE, OKAY, I'M SIXTH."
1029,00:35:24.37,00:35:24.37,THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY GOOD.
1030,00:35:25.47,00:35:25.47,"Jeff: SO, EDNA, IF COCHRAN"
1031,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93,BELIEVES HE'S SEVENTH AND YOU
1032,00:35:29.13,00:35:29.13,"BELIEVE YOU'RE SIXTH, ALL YOU"
1033,00:35:30.20,00:35:30.20,NEED IS TO FIND WHO'S FIFTH AND
1034,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,WHO'S FOURTH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
1035,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"IN THE MONEY, EITHER."
1036,00:35:34.73,00:35:34.73,"YEAH, SURE."
1037,00:35:36.47,00:35:36.47,TALK TO PEOPLE AND FIND A LITTLE
1038,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,"CRACK, AND EXPANDING THAT."
1039,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PUBLICITY
1040,00:35:43.70,00:35:43.70,ACT.
1041,00:35:44.10,00:35:44.10,SO WE HAVE TO FIND CERTAIN
1042,00:35:45.50,00:35:45.50,ANGLES AND APPROACH THEM.
1043,00:35:46.60,00:35:46.60,Jeff: JEFF.
1044,00:35:48.27,00:35:48.27,Jeff: BRANDON.
1045,00:35:49.10,00:35:49.10,EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT'S
1046,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THESE TWO.
1047,00:35:51.77,00:35:51.77,THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M VOTING
1048,00:35:53.30,00:35:53.30,OUT COCHRAN AND THEN THE NEXT
1049,00:35:54.90,00:35:54.90,NIGHT MY VOTE IS FOR EDNA.
1050,00:35:57.20,00:35:57.20,LET'S NOT TRY TO BE SO GRAY OUT
1051,00:35:59.97,00:35:59.97,THERE AND JUST GET IT OUT THERE.
1052,00:36:00.47,00:36:00.47,I DO BELIEVE THERE'S BLACK AND
1053,00:36:02.33,00:36:02.33,"WHITE AND IF THERE'S GRAY, YOU"
1054,00:36:03.60,00:36:03.60,"MIGHT AS WELL BE LYING, TO BE"
1055,00:36:04.80,00:36:04.80,HONEST WITH YOU.
1056,00:36:05.73,00:36:05.73,"Jeff: COACH, BRANDON NOW"
1057,00:36:07.43,00:36:07.43,POSES A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ANYBODY
1058,00:36:09.27,00:36:09.27,IN HIS ALLIANCE.
1059,00:36:10.80,00:36:10.80,HE IS NOT MALLEABLE.
1060,00:36:11.60,00:36:11.60,SO IF SOMETHING GOES HAYWIRE
1061,00:36:13.47,00:36:13.47,"WITH OUR PLAN, BRANDON AIN'T"
1062,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,GOING TO HELP.
1063,00:36:16.07,00:36:16.07,"RIGHT, THE FACT THAT BRANDON"
1064,00:36:17.80,00:36:17.80,IS NOT MALLEABLE IN THIS GAME IS
1065,00:36:19.63,00:36:19.63,BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

1067,00:36:22.80,00:36:22.80,THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO TURN ON
1068,00:36:24.07,00:36:24.07,"YOU, BUT YOU'RE ALSO AFRAID THAT"
1069,00:36:26.00,00:36:26.00,HE'S GOING TO SPILT APPLE CART.
1070,00:36:28.27,00:36:28.27,"Jeff: BRANDON, ARE YOU"
1071,00:36:29.50,00:36:29.50,EXHAUSTED RIGHT NOW?
1072,00:36:30.50,00:36:30.50,YEAH.
1073,00:36:36.83,00:36:36.83,Jeff: WHAT HAS TRIED YOU
1074,00:36:38.53,00:36:38.53,THE MOST IN THIS GAME?
1075,00:36:39.80,00:36:39.80,I WANT TO DO WRONG THINGS.
1076,00:36:43.27,00:36:43.27,I'M HUMAN.
1077,00:36:45.50,00:36:45.50,BUT I-- THERE'S SOMETHING ST
1078,00:36:49.90,00:36:49.90,STRONGER INSIDE ME THAT WON'T
1079,00:36:53.53,00:36:53.53,LET ME.
1080,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IS NOT
1081,00:36:59.73,00:36:59.73,GOING TO BE EASY.
1082,00:37:00.77,00:37:00.77,SO THAT'S ALL I'M TELLING MYSELF
1083,00:37:02.37,00:37:02.37,IN MY HEAD.
1084,00:37:03.47,00:37:03.47,ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IS NOT
1085,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,GOING TO BE EASY.
1086,00:37:08.27,00:37:08.27,THAT'S ALL.
1087,00:37:11.03,00:37:11.03,"Jeff: COCHRAN, AS HARD AS"
1088,00:37:12.57,00:37:12.57,IT IS TO SEE BRANDON UPSET FROM
1089,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"A GAME POINT OF VIEW, IT'S A"
1090,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,SPARK OF LIFE.
1091,00:37:17.47,00:37:17.47,MAYBE THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM.
1092,00:37:19.70,00:37:19.70,"I MEAN, I THINK BRANDON'S"
1093,00:37:21.60,00:37:21.60,REVEALED HE'S PROBABLY NOT THE
1094,00:37:22.73,00:37:22.73,BEST PERSON TO BE IN A STRATEGIC
1095,00:37:24.83,00:37:24.83,PARTNERSHIP WITH.
1096,00:37:27.13,00:37:27.13,TALKING STRAIT WITH BRANDON IS
1097,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,LIKE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SHIRTS
1098,00:37:32.50,00:37:32.50,THAT AREN'T BLUE BLUE.
1099,00:37:33.80,00:37:33.80,HE DOESN'T COMPREHEND IT.
1100,00:37:35.50,00:37:35.50,IT ISN'T IN HIS VOCABULARY.
1101,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,I WOULDN'T WANT TO COME UP WITH
1102,00:37:40.17,00:37:40.17,STRATEGIC IDEAS WITH HIM BECAUSE
1103,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
1104,00:37:45.30,00:37:45.30,LANGUAGE.
1105,00:37:45.63,00:37:45.63,"Jeff: ALBERT, IS THAT TRUE"
1106,00:37:47.90,00:37:47.90,ABOUT BRANDON?
1107,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"CHARACTER ASIDE, NOT THE"
1108,00:37:51.27,00:37:51.27,GREATEST STRATEGY PLAYER OUT
1109,00:37:52.07,00:37:52.07,HERE?
1110,00:37:52.27,00:37:52.27,YEAH.
1111,00:37:52.73,00:37:52.73,I THINK IT'S SOMETIMES UNSETTLE
1112,00:37:57.13,00:37:57.13,GLG SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN
1113,00:37:58.40,00:37:58.40,THIS GAME AND YOUR ALLIANCE HAS
1114,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,TO MAKE A DIFFERENT MOVE AND
1115,00:38:01.83,00:38:01.83,"BRANDON SAYS, ""WISH I COULD,"
1116,00:38:05.13,00:38:05.13,"CAN'T."""
1117,00:38:05.53,00:38:05.53,I THINK RIGHT NOW THE WAY OUR
1118,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,TRIBE IS I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT
1119,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,ANYTHING HAPPENING IN THE GAME.
1120,00:38:09.80,00:38:09.80,AND I THINK--
1121,00:38:10.70,00:38:10.70,"IF EDNA WINS IMMUNITY, WHAT"
1122,00:38:14.90,00:38:14.90,HAPPENS?
1123,00:38:15.37,00:38:15.37,Jeff: WOW.
1124,00:38:17.40,00:38:17.40,THEN IT STARTS.
1125,00:38:19.37,00:38:19.37,Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN A BIT
1126,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27,"OF AN EYE-OPENING TRIBAL, HASN'T"
1127,00:38:24.80,00:38:24.80,IT NO?
1128,00:38:25.63,00:38:25.63,NO.
1129,00:38:25.90,00:38:25.90,Jeff: REALLY?
1130,00:38:28.43,00:38:28.43,"SO, COCHRAN, HOW FRUSTRATING IS"
1131,00:38:30.70,00:38:30.70,IT IF THE MOVE YOU MADE WAS FOR
1132,00:38:33.60,00:38:33.60,NAUGHT?
1133,00:38:33.97,00:38:33.97,IT'S INTENSELY FRUSTRATING.
1134,00:38:36.17,00:38:36.17,I THOUGHT I WAS BEING SOME SAVVY
1135,00:38:37.77,00:38:37.77,GAME PLAYER AND THEN I GET VOTED
1136,00:38:41.10,00:38:41.10,OUT IN A WORSE POSITION THAN I
1137,00:38:43.30,00:38:43.30,PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IF I STUCK
1138,00:38:45.27,00:38:45.27,WITH MY OLD TRIBE.
1139,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,IT'S EXTREMELY HUMILIATING.
1140,00:38:48.43,00:38:48.43,I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING A
1141,00:38:50.27,00:38:50.27,"""SURVIVOR"" EXPERT."
1142,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,I HOPE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE ONE
1143,00:38:53.13,00:38:53.13,OF THE MOST IDIOTIC MOVES IN THE
1144,00:38:55.07,00:38:55.07,HISTORY OF THE GAME.
1145,00:38:59.17,00:38:59.17,Jeff: IT HAS BEEN ONE OF
