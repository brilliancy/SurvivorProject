32,00:02:58.67,00:02:58.67,Horrible.It's empty.

34,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,They're going to want to knowwhat's going on.

47,00:03:59.40,00:03:59.40,which is interesting.I got hugged by Chapera in a

56,00:04:22.40,00:04:22.40,"is just, sort of summarizesthis tribe."
57,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,I don't think this tribeamounted to a whole lot.
58,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,"We were just kind of in themiddle, and I think Colby was"
59,00:04:31.17,00:04:31.17,actually holding us backbecause he didn't trust
60,00:04:34.20,00:04:34.20,anybody.And it's too late.
61,00:04:36.83,00:04:36.83,I think it's too late for thistribe to rally.
62,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,"I will try to think morepositive thoughts, but it's"
63,00:04:42.20,00:04:42.20,difficult because now Ethan isquestioning it all.
64,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,(thunder booms)>> Colby didn't look
65,00:04:58.97,00:04:58.97,at anyone when he left.>> I'm so surprised.

67,00:05:03.27,00:05:03.27,">> Yeah, just a turn aroundaround and a, you know..."
68,00:05:05.67,00:05:05.67,">> I would have been like,to Jerri after saying all those"

70,00:05:10.87,00:05:10.87,">> That's too bad.>> Ooh, don't I feel silly."
71,00:05:18.37,00:05:18.37,Wow.The one vote was supposed to
72,00:05:22.60,00:05:22.60,be for me and the rest weresupposed to be for Jerri.
73,00:05:24.97,00:05:24.97,"I thought everything was goingsmoothly, and boom, you know?"
74,00:05:28.83,00:05:28.83,"Not only was Colby fooled andvoted out, but I was fooled"
75,00:05:33.20,00:05:33.20,and had no idea.(thunder rumbling)
76,00:05:38.30,00:05:38.30,I thought I was pretty closeto Lex.
77,00:05:40.60,00:05:40.60,Not anymore.Not after Tribal Council.
78,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,Not after I was left out ofthose plans.
79,00:05:45.60,00:05:45.60,When you feel a bond withsomeone and they tell you
80,00:05:49.40,00:05:49.40,"something, and then they ripthat bond apart by doing"
81,00:05:52.07,00:05:52.07,"something totally different,that hurts."
82,00:05:56.63,00:05:56.63,(chuckling)(laughing)
83,00:06:02.27,00:06:02.27,">> Yes, I feel like I'mbeing evil right now, but, boy,"

86,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00,"one of my goals in this game,and that is to make it longer"

511,00:31:52.23,00:31:52.23,don't even talk about it 'causehe may try to pull a Hail Mary
512,00:31:54.77,00:31:54.77,"move of some sort, and it's justnot worth it for us."
513,00:31:57.63,00:31:57.63,We can stay in this game.You don't need to ask me about
514,00:32:00.07,00:32:00.07,"it, but it's Ethan tonight.>> Okay."

518,00:32:15.23,00:32:15.23,Um... it's dangerous.Ethan and I came into this game
519,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,"with a bit of a handicap, andthat is that we have not just,"
520,00:32:22.27,00:32:22.27,you know... we're not justacquaintances outside the game.
521,00:32:25.33,00:32:25.33,We're good friends.I knew that the last thing he
522,00:32:29.43,00:32:29.43,wanted to have happen to him inthis game was to be blindsided
523,00:32:31.80,00:32:31.80,and to get voted out withoutknowing about it ahead of time.
524,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,And I think the honorable thingto do here was to tell him when
525,00:32:37.77,00:32:37.77,it was going to happen.I've got my own agenda this
526,00:32:41.13,00:32:41.13,time; I've got my own plan.It doesn't include him.
527,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,I can't afford ballast; I can'tafford dead weight; and I
528,00:32:47.07,00:32:47.07,certainly can't be dragging anex-winner along with me just
529,00:32:49.50,00:32:49.50,because he's my friend.This isn't Africa.
530,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,This is All-Star.There are two things I need to
531,00:32:56.03,00:32:56.03,"talk to you about.I mean, one is the game."
532,00:32:58.50,00:32:58.50,And one is our friendship.And the two things... and I know
533,00:33:01.63,00:33:01.63,"it's hard for you at this pointto see how one can, you know,"
534,00:33:05.20,00:33:05.20,"somehow exist separate from theother, but I'm going to try to"
535,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,make you understand how it hasto be that way.
536,00:33:12.27,00:33:12.27,"Um, I think that at this point,it's just, it's better for my"
537,00:33:17.10,00:33:17.10,game if we vote you out tonight.But it has nothing to do
538,00:33:20.97,00:33:20.97,with friendship.This is business.
539,00:33:23.40,00:33:23.40,Strictly business.And I have to play the game
540,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"differently this time around,because the first time around,"
541,00:33:29.87,00:33:29.87,I lost.>> You have to play...
542,00:33:32.30,00:33:32.30,"Lex, as much as you say you wantit, this is business, it's not."
543,00:33:35.20,00:33:35.20,>> It's not easy for me totell you this 'cause I know how
544,00:33:37.70,00:33:37.70,disappointing this is.Am I having fun doing this? No.
545,00:33:40.57,00:33:40.57,Am I taking pleasure in tellingyou this? No.
546,00:33:42.70,00:33:42.70,"In fact, this is horrible.But I wanted... I wanted to talk"
547,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,"to you about this 'cause Ididn't want to blindside you,"
548,00:33:48.03,00:33:48.03,"and I didn't think that it wasright, I didn't think it was"
549,00:33:50.00,00:33:50.00,"fair, and I didn't think it wascool."
550,00:33:51.23,00:33:51.23,And I know... that it's a majordrag for you to go out of the
551,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,"game for Jerri, and Iunderstand that."
552,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,>> She's done nothing forthis game; she's done nothing
553,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,for this tribe; she's donenothing for you; and you're
554,00:34:02.97,00:34:02.97,rewarding her with it.She does not deserve to be here.
555,00:34:05.67,00:34:05.67,She didn't lift a finger overthere.
556,00:34:07.43,00:34:07.43,>> That's why.She's not much of a threat.
557,00:34:10.30,00:34:10.30,>> But she does notdeserve to be here.
558,00:34:12.17,00:34:12.17,>> I know that.>> She does not deserve to be
559,00:34:14.27,00:34:14.27,here.>> Sorry.
560,00:34:20.40,00:34:20.40,"And, dude, I'm sorry.>> Don't apologize."
561,00:34:33.37,00:34:33.37,"What pisses me off the most is,if they think Jerri more worthy"
562,00:34:38.07,00:34:38.07,"to stay in this game than I am,then... that there's something"
563,00:34:43.87,00:34:43.87,"wrong with their screws in theirhead, and I don't know what game"
564,00:34:46.70,00:34:46.70,they're playing.Lex is like...
565,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,"I told Lex, you know, Jerridoesn't deserve to be here,"
566,00:35:00.70,00:35:00.70,"all that smack.He's, like, ""That's little stuff"
567,00:35:02.23,00:35:02.23,"to me.""He's, like, ""I don't care."""
568,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,"He's, like, ""I'll deal withthat."""
569,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,Jerri's a vote I can... I canpull her along and get rid of
570,00:35:07.57,00:35:07.57,her whenever I want.She'll do anything I say.
571,00:35:10.57,00:35:10.57,That's... (grunts)(growls)
572,00:35:12.77,00:35:12.77,">> I know, I know.>> And she's gonna get"
573,00:35:15.73,00:35:15.73,further than you...>> No.
574,00:35:17.30,00:35:17.30,>> She might.There's no rhyme or reason of
575,00:35:19.83,00:35:19.83,how Lex is playing this game.There'll be no sense of security
576,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,"with Lex at any time.I mean, he told me that."
577,00:35:26.23,00:35:26.23,"I mean, he told me that overthere, 'cause that's why he's"
578,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"voting me off.>> When I talked to Ethan,"
579,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,"and I looked into his eyes,you know, I truly would love"
580,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,to bring him with us.He is a nice guy.
581,00:35:36.53,00:35:36.53,He has a big heart.(whispering): I do not believe
582,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40,he'll bring me along for verylong.
583,00:35:40.83,00:35:40.83,Because I don't trust anybodyin this game.
584,00:35:43.53,00:35:43.53,But I don't want to take Lex outbefore Jerri.
585,00:35:46.07,00:35:46.07,>> No.>> It would be Jerri tonight.
586,00:35:48.00,00:35:48.00,"All right.>> So I'll vote for Jerri,"
587,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,"and then you and she cantalk about it, and I'll..."
588,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03,"I'm a gambler.>> I'm leaning towards you,"
589,00:35:56.37,00:35:56.37,"believe me.I don't know, there's something,"
590,00:36:02.30,00:36:02.30,"again, about looking intoEthan's eyes and also looking"
591,00:36:04.63,00:36:04.63,into Lex's eyes.There is a moment that you need
592,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,to trust and have loyalty inthis game.
593,00:36:08.90,00:36:08.90,You've got to.There is no way I want Jerri in
594,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,the final four.I just don't want her around.
595,00:36:15.47,00:36:15.47,"I want somebody, truly, thatplays the game well, but also"
596,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,works.I want somebody with bug bites
597,00:36:20.67,00:36:20.67,on them and scratches and theirfingers are gnarled.
598,00:36:23.77,00:36:23.77,I'm sorry.It's just the way I am.
599,00:36:25.53,00:36:25.53,"I've been thinking about it, butthe sun's going down."

601,00:36:52.10,00:36:52.10,Day 21.Let's talk about today's
602,00:36:54.57,00:36:54.57,"challenge.Jerri, you ended up in the hero-"
603,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"or-goat role, depending on howit came out."
604,00:37:00.47,00:37:00.47,Was that your choice?Were you elected?
605,00:37:02.73,00:37:02.73,"Was it random?>> I volunteered, um,"
606,00:37:07.23,00:37:07.23,"because I do have archeryexperience, and... my tribe"
607,00:37:11.60,00:37:11.60,"trusted and believed in me,and I let them down."
608,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"I apologize profusely.So regardless of the outcome, I"
609,00:37:20.93,00:37:20.93,"feel good about it.>> PROBST: Shii Ann, is there a"
610,00:37:23.23,00:37:23.23,"little bit of relief whensomebody else steps up and says,"
611,00:37:25.53,00:37:25.53,"""I'll take that role,"" knowingthat at least you can't be the"
612,00:37:28.57,00:37:28.57,goat?>> Today Jerri volunteered.
613,00:37:30.60,00:37:30.60,"I believed her.We all believed her, and"
614,00:37:33.83,00:37:33.83,"unfortunately, we lost.But that could have happened"
615,00:37:37.10,00:37:37.10,"with anyone.>> PROBST: Kathy, would Jerri be"
616,00:37:39.30,00:37:39.30,thinking irrationally if she wasa little worried that maybe
617,00:37:41.87,00:37:41.87,tonight that challenge is gonnacome back to haunt her?
618,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,">> You know, I'm sureshe's concerned about it."
619,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,"You know, it'd be under my skinif I stepped forward like that."
620,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,"Especially now, when things aredwindling."
621,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"You know, it's human nature.I'm sure she's concerned."
622,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,">> PROBST: Ethan, has it crossedyour mind that you're the last"
623,00:37:58.10,00:37:58.10,remaining previous winner inthis game?
624,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,">> Yeah, it has.I like that."
625,00:38:03.37,00:38:03.37,"I'm proud of the way I played,and I'm happy that I'm still"
626,00:38:06.07,00:38:06.07,here.>> PROBST: What about you is the
627,00:38:07.80,00:38:07.80,biggest threat to the other foursitting here tonight?
628,00:38:11.23,00:38:11.23,">> I think, uh, I'm athreat to these other four"
629,00:38:13.47,00:38:13.47,"because, uh, I'm a winner.But in addition to that, that's"
630,00:38:18.60,00:38:18.60,"something they should look into,saying, ""Well, that's an"
631,00:38:21.13,00:38:21.13,"advantage as well.""No one's gonna vote for a winner"
632,00:38:24.40,00:38:24.40,"in the final two, Jeff.Principle alone, no one wants to"
633,00:38:26.77,00:38:26.77,"see a winner win again.>> PROBST: Lex, you kind of..."
634,00:38:28.87,00:38:28.87,had a weird reaction to that.>> I don't think that's
635,00:38:32.30,00:38:32.30,"necessarily true.In fact, if I was on the jury,"
636,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"and if that winner was shrewdenough to just make a good,"
637,00:38:37.57,00:38:37.57,"pointed argument that,""You know what?"
638,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,I came into this game with thebiggest target on my back.
639,00:38:42.20,00:38:42.20,"None of you figured I could everget this far, and the fact that,"
640,00:38:45.73,00:38:45.73,"even against all odds, I made itto the final two,"" I'd have a"
641,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,hard time picking reasons not tovote him to win because that
642,00:38:52.87,00:38:52.87,guy made it against all odds.>> PROBST: Tough game.
643,00:38:58.23,00:38:58.23,>> Yeah.>> PROBST: Touch decisions.

646,00:39:20.70,00:39:20.70,my life into your handsand you blew it.
647,00:39:24.10,00:39:24.10,I feel you've not played thegame well; I feel you've not
648,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,worked hard enough; and I thinkyou should be voted off.
649,00:39:42.83,00:39:42.83,">> It's really, really easyto win with grace and dignity,"
650,00:39:46.90,00:39:46.90,but it's much harder to losewith that same grace and
651,00:39:49.83,00:39:49.83,dignity.Let's see how you do.
652,00:40:08.83,00:40:08.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.

661,00:41:00.23,00:41:00.23,"You need to bring me your torch.Ethan, the tribe has spoken."
662,00:41:14.47,00:41:14.47,>> Have fun. Play hard.Don't let the bedbugs bite.
