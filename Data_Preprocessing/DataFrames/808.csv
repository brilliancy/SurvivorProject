4,00:00:08.00,00:00:08.00,The winning tribe will select one member from the losing
5,00:00:11.20,00:00:11.20,"tribe to join them on the reward, which means they avoid"
6,00:00:14.40,00:00:14.40,Tribal Council. (cheering)

8,00:00:20.60,00:00:20.60,"between Ethan and Boston Rob was red-hot, but Chapera"
9,00:00:24.27,00:00:24.27,pulled out a narrow victory. Chapera wins reward and
10,00:00:28.80,00:00:28.80,"immunity. Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy,"
11,00:00:32.33,00:00:32.33,"saving her from Tribal Council. Chapera, by the way, that's"
12,00:00:36.53,00:00:36.53,your ride. A 94-foot luxury yacht.
13,00:00:39.00,00:00:39.00,"While enjoying a day of food and fun, Kathy hit it off with"
14,00:00:43.60,00:00:43.60,the rival tribe. >> \xe2\x99\xaa We got a new girl
15,00:00:46.40,00:00:46.40,Her name is Kat \xe2\x99\xaa >> \xe2\x99\xaa She fits in
16,00:00:48.27,00:00:48.27,"just like that. \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: At Mogo Mogo, Colby"
17,00:00:50.80,00:00:50.80,and Ethan agreed to get rid of Jerri.
18,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57,>> I think our decision was made when Jerri Manthey
19,00:00:55.67,00:00:55.67,"came on board. I mean, that's the one we want"
20,00:00:57.23,00:00:57.23,to get rid of. >> PROBST: But Lex made a bold
21,00:00:59.40,00:00:59.40,play. >> Their plan is to get
22,00:01:01.90,00:01:01.90,rid of you tonight. That's not going to happen.
23,00:01:04.00,00:01:04.00,"We're going to do Colby tonight. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
24,00:01:08.77,00:01:08.77,"Lex's gamble paid off, and Colby was stunned when he"
25,00:01:12.23,00:01:12.23,became the seventh person to leave Survivor: All-Stars.
26,00:01:16.67,00:01:16.67,11 all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

29,00:02:37.60,00:02:37.60,(thunder crashing) >> Is anybody here?
30,00:02:44.13,00:02:44.13,"Hello? Oh, they're still at the Tribal"
31,00:02:49.03,00:02:49.03,Council. Just how depressing is this?
32,00:02:52.97,00:02:52.97,(groans) It's terrible coming back here.
33,00:02:58.67,00:02:58.67,Horrible. It's empty.
34,00:03:01.23,00:03:01.23,They're going to come back from Tribal Council.
35,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,They're going to want to know what's going on.
36,00:03:06.77,00:03:06.77,I got automatic immunity. They voted somebody off.
37,00:03:10.10,00:03:10.10,I had a ball. (thunder cracks)
38,00:03:12.63,00:03:12.63,"(grunts) Ah, this is Suvivor at the"
39,00:03:17.83,00:03:17.83,lowest. I was sipping champagne on the
40,00:03:21.47,00:03:21.47,"bow of a multimillion-dollar yacht, and now I am soaking"
41,00:03:25.13,00:03:25.13,"wet trying to save this fire. Oh, my God."

43,00:03:42.00,00:03:42.00,"(indistinct talking) >> You have a good time, Kathy?"
44,00:03:47.30,00:03:47.30,>> I couldn't believe I was standing here putting a
45,00:03:48.97,00:03:48.97,fire together and it started to pour.
46,00:03:50.90,00:03:50.90,">> There, you got it. >> The tribe got back"
47,00:03:55.80,00:03:55.80,"and they, you know, didn't give me any hugs or anything,"
48,00:03:59.40,00:03:59.40,which is interesting. I got hugged by Chapera in a
49,00:04:02.33,00:04:02.33,"second, but that's just not this tribe."
50,00:04:06.00,00:04:06.00,>> The Tribal Council was brutal tonight.
51,00:04:08.27,00:04:08.27,>> I bet it was. Heard that Colby got voted out.
52,00:04:11.30,00:04:11.30,"It was very somber and sad. >> His hat, his pants,"
53,00:04:13.40,00:04:13.40,"his canteen. >> His hat's not here, is it?"
54,00:04:15.10,00:04:15.10,>> His hat's here. >> I really want to send
55,00:04:18.13,00:04:18.13,that to him. I hope we can.
56,00:04:19.63,00:04:19.63,>> We will. >> Having Colby gone to me
57,00:04:22.40,00:04:22.40,"is just, sort of summarizes this tribe."
58,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,I don't think this tribe amounted to a whole lot.
59,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,"We were just kind of in the middle, and I think Colby was"
60,00:04:31.17,00:04:31.17,actually holding us back because he didn't trust
61,00:04:34.20,00:04:34.20,anybody. And it's too late.
62,00:04:36.83,00:04:36.83,I think it's too late for this tribe to rally.
63,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,"I will try to think more positive thoughts, but it's"
64,00:04:42.20,00:04:42.20,difficult because now Ethan is questioning it all.
65,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,(thunder booms) >> Colby didn't look
66,00:04:58.97,00:04:58.97,at anyone when he left. >> I'm so surprised.
67,00:05:01.30,00:05:01.30,>> He didn't even look behind him.
68,00:05:03.27,00:05:03.27,">> Yeah, just a turn around around and a, you know..."
69,00:05:05.67,00:05:05.67,">> I would have been like, to Jerri after saying all those"
70,00:05:07.63,00:05:07.63,"things, I would have been, like, ""You got me."""
71,00:05:10.87,00:05:10.87,">> That's too bad. >> Ooh, don't I feel silly."
72,00:05:18.37,00:05:18.37,Wow. The one vote was supposed to
73,00:05:22.60,00:05:22.60,be for me and the rest were supposed to be for Jerri.
74,00:05:24.97,00:05:24.97,"I thought everything was going smoothly, and boom, you know?"
75,00:05:28.83,00:05:28.83,"Not only was Colby fooled and voted out, but I was fooled"
76,00:05:33.20,00:05:33.20,and had no idea. (thunder rumbling)
77,00:05:38.30,00:05:38.30,I thought I was pretty close to Lex.
78,00:05:40.60,00:05:40.60,Not anymore. Not after Tribal Council.
79,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,Not after I was left out of those plans.
80,00:05:45.60,00:05:45.60,When you feel a bond with someone and they tell you
81,00:05:49.40,00:05:49.40,"something, and then they rip that bond apart by doing"
82,00:05:52.07,00:05:52.07,"something totally different, that hurts."
83,00:05:56.63,00:05:56.63,(chuckling) (laughing)
84,00:06:02.27,00:06:02.27,">> Yes, I feel like I'm being evil right now, but, boy,"
85,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,does it feel good. >> Colby's gone.
86,00:06:15.13,00:06:15.13,"I mean, what more can I say? I've now officially lived out"
87,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00,"one of my goals in this game, and that is to make it longer"
88,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17,"than Colby. Knock, knock."
89,00:06:24.30,00:06:24.30,"You hear that sound, Colby? That's the bellboy, and he"
90,00:06:27.40,00:06:27.40,just took all my baggage away. So...
91,00:06:31.47,00:06:31.47,My closet is now clean. My Survivor closet is clean.
92,00:06:38.80,00:06:38.80,>> We have tree mail. >> All right.
93,00:06:43.20,00:06:43.20,Ooh... pretty bottle. >> Very pretty.
94,00:06:45.90,00:06:45.90,">> Oh, my Gosh. >> Oh, that's dinner."
95,00:06:50.97,00:06:50.97,">> ""Pick one representative to get on a boat and visit the"
96,00:06:55.30,00:06:55.30,Mogo Mogo tribe camp. Bring this message in a bottle

98,00:07:01.77,00:07:01.77,Mogo Mogo tribe. Follow the instructions.

100,00:07:09.90,00:07:09.90,us was scared to death. Not one of us wanted to go.
101,00:07:12.10,00:07:12.10,We were so afraid that that person might have to stay over
102,00:07:14.23,00:07:14.23,"there. So we decided to pull straws,"
103,00:07:17.20,00:07:17.20,and Jenna ended up picking the smallest straw.
104,00:07:20.60,00:07:20.60,It's Jenna. >> You okay?
105,00:07:22.23,00:07:22.23,>> Yeah. >> You sure you're all right?
106,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,>> Yeah. So I just happened to get the
107,00:07:26.77,00:07:26.77,shortest straw. I don't think it's a good thing.
108,00:07:31.17,00:07:31.17,">> All right, sweetheart. Have fun."
109,00:07:33.27,00:07:33.27,">> Yes. >> Have a good time, Jenna."
110,00:07:35.37,00:07:35.37,>> See if Ethan and my alliance are still tight.
111,00:07:38.60,00:07:38.60,(laughing) >> There's got be something
112,00:07:44.43,00:07:44.43,"that when you go over there, you're on the fence."
113,00:07:47.47,00:07:47.47,>> I think we should take two things into consideration.
114,00:07:49.73,00:07:49.73,"Nobody who doesn't want to go should go, and the decision"
115,00:07:52.80,00:07:52.80,should be one that everyone finds agreeable.
116,00:07:56.20,00:07:56.20,>> I think Kathy might be a good representative.
117,00:07:59.00,00:07:59.00,>> It's up to you guys what you want to do.
118,00:08:00.47,00:08:00.47,"I don't mind going over, but we definitely had a good"
119,00:08:01.93,00:08:01.93,rapport yesterday. I know the players over there.
120,00:08:03.33,00:08:03.33,I know they accept me. I know that the hair on the
121,00:08:06.27,00:08:06.27,back of neck won't stand up on end if I get off the boat over
122,00:08:08.57,00:08:08.57,"on their beach. >> Bye, Kath."
123,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,We love you! Look at that rainbow she's
124,00:08:14.90,00:08:14.90,sailing off into. It's a good omen.
125,00:08:26.93,00:08:26.93,"(indistinct talking) >> Hey, welcome to Mogo Mogo."
126,00:08:32.90,00:08:32.90,>> How are you? >> I'm great.
127,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,>> My guess is you have a bottle.
128,00:08:36.50,00:08:36.50,>> I have a bottle and a pen. (glass shatters)

182,00:11:16.10,00:11:16.10,sit out one man in this challenge.

244,00:15:52.23,00:15:52.23,"spear's a way that we gather food every day, and, you know, "
245,00:15:57.97,00:15:57.97,"as if that weren't enough, it's a bit of a one-two punch with"
246,00:16:00.87,00:16:00.87,the rice as well. >> Knock-knock.
247,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,>> Hey. >> Hello.

258,00:16:45.97,00:16:45.97,"This is a game, and they know that."
259,00:16:48.10,00:16:48.10,"So it was nice that I brought something over to them to say,"
260,00:16:50.97,00:16:50.97,"like, ""I'm very sorry that you guys don't have these things,"
261,00:16:53.07,00:16:53.07,"and I have to take more from you."""
262,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,>> We were wondering if you would be kind enough to
263,00:16:57.50,00:16:57.50,give us a couple of scoops of rice from our bag.
264,00:17:00.53,00:17:00.53,"Because we lost a lot of our rice to mildew in the beginning,"
265,00:17:04.30,00:17:04.30,"and we've been really rationing for, you know, a rainy day."
266,00:17:09.13,00:17:09.13,>> Okay. >> And...
267,00:17:11.33,00:17:11.33,">> What do you have exactly? You have one full bag, and...?"
268,00:17:14.07,00:17:14.07,>> One full bag and like a fourth of the other bag.
269,00:17:16.43,00:17:16.43,I was wondering if you would be kind enough to give us...
270,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10,">> Yes, of course. >> ...a couple of..."
271,00:17:21.47,00:17:21.47,">> We've been so diligent about rationing our rice, which"
272,00:17:24.37,00:17:24.37,"at this point, you know... hindsight is 20-20 and you don't"
273,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,"know what's going to happen, but you're almost kicking yourself"
274,00:17:29.93,00:17:29.93,because we were eating only as much as we needed to make it
275,00:17:33.60,00:17:33.60,"last longer and now we just lost, you know, the lion's share"
276,00:17:36.03,00:17:36.03,"of what we had. >> Thank you, Jenna."
277,00:17:37.93,00:17:37.93,">> No, we're not trying to wipe you out."
278,00:17:40.20,00:17:40.20,"It was just what we needed, so..."
279,00:17:42.73,00:17:42.73,>> And you got the grade-A rice. >> Yes. Thank you so much.
280,00:17:45.70,00:17:45.70,The vibe is down. I don't care what they're saying
281,00:17:47.87,00:17:47.87,"when we come to immunity challenges, they are down."
282,00:17:50.57,00:17:50.57,"They know... they're trying to smile, they're trying to be"
283,00:17:52.87,00:17:52.87,"nice, but they're not happy. They're slowly losing everything"
284,00:17:56.30,00:17:56.30,they have. They're not happy.
285,00:18:05.13,00:18:05.13,>> They ain't got a whole hell of a lot over there to get.
286,00:18:07.60,00:18:07.60,>> We got the biggest stuff they have.
287,00:18:09.90,00:18:09.90,>> We got everything. We won everything.
288,00:18:12.67,00:18:12.67,"This whole game, this whole game is about Chapera kicking ass."
289,00:18:16.37,00:18:16.37,>> I'm going real slow so I don't drop anything.
290,00:18:20.07,00:18:20.07,"Oh, my tribe was psyched when I came back with the loot."
291,00:18:22.93,00:18:22.93,"I have rice, and Rupert just never put down that Hawaiian"
292,00:18:25.83,00:18:25.83,sling. >> We're going to sharpen them
293,00:18:27.53,00:18:27.53,"points down to a... Oh, my God."
294,00:18:31.47,00:18:31.47,I've been waiting 20 days to not have to poke fish with a stick.
295,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13,I'm going to be the hunter tomorrow.
296,00:18:38.27,00:18:38.27,I hope I see that big six-foot shark.
297,00:18:41.63,00:18:41.63,I hope I see that yellowfin tuna.
298,00:18:43.93,00:18:43.93,I hope I see that grouper that's this big.
299,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,">> I know you're excited. >> Oh, my gosh, I'm excited."
300,00:18:49.70,00:18:49.70,">> I'm excited, too. >> I've made ten different"
301,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,spears trying to get that damn thing.
302,00:19:01.33,00:19:01.33,>> Today is definitely one of the best days for me.
303,00:19:03.53,00:19:03.53,"The fact that we're getting more rice, eating more, helped out"
304,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,great in the challenge. And it's just ended up being a
305,00:19:08.57,00:19:08.57,really good day. >> Right.
306,00:19:10.40,00:19:10.40,(laughter) Everybody has gas every now
307,00:19:14.23,00:19:14.23,and again. Especially in this situation.
308,00:19:17.20,00:19:17.20,"You see the abuse? You see that, Jenna?"
309,00:19:19.43,00:19:19.43,"That's grounds for ""I'll see ya later."""
310,00:19:21.23,00:19:21.23,">> If Rob and Amber are not playing kissy face, sucky,"
311,00:19:24.23,00:19:24.23,"kissy face yet, they are going to be soon."
312,00:19:27.37,00:19:27.37,"Um, I have walked up on them in the middle in the night where"
313,00:19:30.93,00:19:30.93,"they just looked so guilty it's not even funny, and I know"
314,00:19:34.07,00:19:34.07,something's going on. >> Later on we'll take a
315,00:19:36.87,00:19:36.87,"walk, all right? >> Definitely at first I"
316,00:19:41.13,00:19:41.13,was stringing him along. The flirting was a huge strategy
317,00:19:44.13,00:19:44.13,"in the beginning. Um, but then I got caught up in"
318,00:19:46.73,00:19:46.73,"it, and feelings, you know, emerged."
319,00:19:50.10,00:19:50.10,"(laughing, talking indistinctly) >> Amber is slammin'."
320,00:19:55.10,00:19:55.10,"She's sweet, she's beautiful, she's funny, she's got a great"
321,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,"personality. Her ass is smokin', too."
322,00:20:19.37,00:20:19.37,>> It's crazy because coming into this game I never
323,00:20:22.10,00:20:22.10,expected in a million years for this to ever happen.
324,00:20:25.40,00:20:25.40,"And actually, I told myself that I wouldn't really let something"
325,00:20:28.60,00:20:28.60,"like this happen, but... I love having the comfort level of it,"
326,00:20:33.43,00:20:33.43,"and I love... I love that he, you know, keeps me warm at night"
327,00:20:37.70,00:20:37.70,"and he, you know, makes me feel safe out here."
328,00:20:40.90,00:20:40.90,"I can vent to him, complain to him about anything and he won't"
329,00:20:43.27,00:20:43.27,hold it against me. You're not ever supposed to feel
330,00:21:01.27,00:21:01.27,"secure in this game, but with Rob and I, I feel 99.9% secure."
331,00:21:09.53,00:21:09.53,>> Amber and I have been fooling around a little bit out
332,00:21:12.23,00:21:12.23,"here. I mean, it's all in good fun."
333,00:21:15.37,00:21:15.37,I'm definitely attracted to her. It'd be nice to have a million
334,00:21:20.07,00:21:20.07,"dollars and take the girl away, too."
335,00:21:24.53,00:21:24.53,"Much better, much better. Good night."
336,00:21:29.43,00:21:29.43,>> Good night. (thunder roaring)
337,00:21:48.20,00:21:48.20,">> We might have a rough one today, boys."
338,00:21:51.47,00:21:51.47,It's pouring right there. >> I'm gonna get fish
339,00:21:54.63,00:21:54.63,before it starts storming again. >> Yeah.
340,00:21:58.30,00:21:58.30,>> Rupert's all excited about having the Hawaiian sling.
341,00:22:01.40,00:22:01.40,"You know, it's his baby. Now he can catch a fish..."
342,00:22:03.80,00:22:03.80,(imitating Rupert) and show how much he's worth to the
343,00:22:06.33,00:22:06.33,tribe. That's his whole life is that
344,00:22:14.07,00:22:14.07,"spear. First of all, the guy looks like"
345,00:22:16.27,00:22:16.27,"Grizzly Adams, but he thinks he's Aqua Man in the ocean."
346,00:22:20.30,00:22:20.30,This guy talks baby talk. What is that?
347,00:22:23.57,00:22:23.57,"You ever notice that? (imitating Rupert) ""My name"
348,00:22:26.30,00:22:26.30,is Rupert. I'm a big and strong fisherman
349,00:22:29.83,00:22:29.83,"in the Pearl Islands."" Now that we got the spear, we"
350,00:22:39.10,00:22:39.10,don't need him. (chuckles)
351,00:22:42.50,00:22:42.50,I'm not sure that we ever did. And he comes back with a bag of
352,00:22:47.37,00:22:47.37,fish feeling all good about himself.
353,00:22:49.90,00:22:49.90,"(chuckling) >> My God, it took all I"
354,00:22:52.70,00:22:52.70,had to stop. >> Is that the 20-pounder
355,00:22:55.23,00:22:55.23,you were talking about? >> Uh-huh.
356,00:22:57.57,00:22:57.57,(laughing) >> I know just as well as
357,00:23:00.63,00:23:00.63,"anybody else, if you got a Hawaiian sling, it's like"
358,00:23:03.60,00:23:03.60,basically going to the pet store and grabbing one of the goldfish
359,00:23:07.50,00:23:07.50,containers and just picking out which fish you want.
360,00:23:10.23,00:23:10.23,"Wow, look... Rupert. >> Hey, I don't think I'll"
361,00:23:12.93,00:23:12.93,take that spear away. >> I'm afraid I'm going to
362,00:23:15.30,00:23:15.30,be embarrassed now. (chuckling)
363,00:23:19.80,00:23:19.80,">> Man, there's a shark that I was looking at like this."
364,00:23:23.20,00:23:23.20,I wanted it. (laughs)
365,00:23:27.53,00:23:27.53,>> ROB (yells): Yeah! >> I'm just glad he
366,00:23:31.40,00:23:31.40,caught a fish. >> Going back down.
367,00:23:33.53,00:23:33.53,>> Okay. >> I proceeded to go into
368,00:23:35.87,00:23:35.87,the water and catch 11 fish myself.
369,00:23:43.40,00:23:43.40,The city kid from Boston with the Hawaiian sling versus Aqua
370,00:23:47.97,00:23:47.97,Man. I'm going to need a boat to tow
371,00:23:51.07,00:23:51.07,this one in. I've never seen anything that
372,00:23:54.03,00:23:54.03,big before. >> Sometimes I really
373,00:23:59.57,00:23:59.57,like Boston Rob... >> Boston style.
374,00:24:03.07,00:24:03.07,>> Other times I see kind of an arrogant pain in the ass.
375,00:24:08.33,00:24:08.33,>> He got a couple fish. >> Very good.
376,00:24:11.10,00:24:11.10,"You know, he wants to be the man."
377,00:24:13.57,00:24:13.57,>> I think Rupert was shocked when he saw that I
378,00:24:15.70,00:24:15.70,brought back so many fish. I think it made him realize that
379,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,we can use Rupert or the Hawaiian sling.
380,00:24:21.77,00:24:21.77,A Hawaiian sling doesn't need any rice.
381,00:24:24.07,00:24:24.07,So Rupert's stock just went down about 20 points.
382,00:24:41.27,00:24:41.27,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. All right, first things first."
383,00:24:53.50,00:24:53.50,Boston Rob. Immunity back up for grabs.
384,00:25:00.93,00:25:00.93,"For today's immunity challenge, we're going to test your skills"
385,00:25:04.23,00:25:04.23,"with a variety of weapons. Along the way, you will earn"
386,00:25:07.43,00:25:07.43,arrows that you will use in the final round.
387,00:25:10.27,00:25:10.27,First round: blow gun. Each tribe member will get one
388,00:25:13.43,00:25:13.43,"chance. At the end of the round, the"
389,00:25:15.30,00:25:15.30,tribe who's closest to the center of the target earns two
390,00:25:17.47,00:25:17.47,arrows. Losing tribe earns one arrow.
391,00:25:20.07,00:25:20.07,Second round: you will throw a spear with the same result.
392,00:25:23.40,00:25:23.40,The tribe that's closest to the center earns two more arrows.
393,00:25:25.97,00:25:25.97,"Losing tribe earns one arrow. For the final round, you will"
394,00:25:29.27,00:25:29.27,take the arrows you've earned and select one tribe member to
395,00:25:31.90,00:25:31.90,be your archer. They will fire arrows at the
396,00:25:34.50,00:25:34.50,final target. Closest to the center of the
397,00:25:36.70,00:25:36.70,target wins immunity for their tribe.
398,00:25:39.00,00:25:39.00,"If you win immunity, you are guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at"
399,00:25:41.90,00:25:41.90,being the sole survivor. Big stakes.
400,00:25:45.07,00:25:45.07,"Chapera, you have one extra member."
401,00:25:46.60,00:25:46.60,Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges.
402,00:25:48.63,00:25:48.63,Big Tom sat out yesterday. Who's sitting out today?
403,00:25:50.87,00:25:50.87,">> Okay, I'll sit out. >> PROBST: All right, Alicia"
404,00:25:52.37,00:25:52.37,will have a spot on the bench. Everybody else wait for my go.
405,00:25:54.87,00:25:54.87,"All right, first round-- blow guns."
406,00:25:56.67,00:25:56.67,We've randomly drew numbers. Chapera will fire first.
407,00:25:58.83,00:25:58.83,Jenna. >> Put her in the red.
408,00:26:03.43,00:26:03.43,">> PROBST: The end of the round, the tribe who is closest to the"
409,00:26:05.57,00:26:05.57,center of the target earns two arrows.
410,00:26:08.57,00:26:08.57,">> That's it, Jenna. Nice and relaxed."
411,00:26:13.57,00:26:13.57,">> PROBST: Jenna, deflects off the target."
412,00:26:15.43,00:26:15.43,No hit. Mogo Mogo.
413,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,Jerri. First shot for Mogo Mogo.
414,00:26:20.80,00:26:20.80,Jerri connects. Mogo Mogo first on the board.
415,00:26:23.97,00:26:23.97,Next up for Chapera. Amber.
416,00:26:28.57,00:26:28.57,Just not enough wind for Amber. (chuckling)
417,00:26:32.40,00:26:32.40,Shii Ann trying to better Jerri's mark.
418,00:26:36.93,00:26:36.93,Shii Ann just short of the target.
419,00:26:39.10,00:26:39.10,Boston Rob. Trying to get Chapera on the
420,00:26:40.87,00:26:40.87,board. Boston Rob misses wide to the
421,00:26:44.83,00:26:44.83,right. Chapera still not on the board.
422,00:26:48.10,00:26:48.10,Kathy up for Mogo Mogo. (laughs)
423,00:26:51.87,00:26:51.87,Kathy just shy of the target. Mogo Mogo still with the mark to
424,00:26:54.70,00:26:54.70,beat. Rupert doesn't connect.
425,00:26:59.23,00:26:59.23,Challenge proving more difficult than we thought.
426,00:27:03.20,00:27:03.20,"Ethan far short of the target. Big Tom, the last shot for"
427,00:27:06.90,00:27:06.90,"Chapera. That's the mark to beat, Big"
428,00:27:09.47,00:27:09.47,"Tom, or Mogo Mogo wins. >> Come on, Big Tom."
429,00:27:14.10,00:27:14.10,">> PROBST: Big Tom can't do it. With one connection, Jerri wins."
430,00:27:17.77,00:27:17.77,"Mogo Mogo earns two arrows, Chapera one."
431,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50,Moving to the next round. (cheering)
432,00:27:25.50,00:27:25.50,"After the first round, Mogo Mogo with two arrows."
433,00:27:28.33,00:27:28.33,Chapera with one. It's time for spear tossing.
434,00:27:31.23,00:27:31.23,Mogo Mogo's up first. Trying to get closest to the
435,00:27:33.37,00:27:33.37,"center of the target, Jerri. Just left."
436,00:27:37.83,00:27:37.83,">> Good try, Jerri. >> PROBST: Chapera, you're up."
437,00:27:43.00,00:27:43.00,And he does. Nice shot.
438,00:27:48.00,00:27:48.00,Close. Chapera still with the mark to
439,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77,beat. Kathy up for Mogo Mogo.
440,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,">> (sighs): Oh. >> Good try, Kathy."
441,00:27:58.33,00:27:58.33,>> PROBST: Big Tom up for Chapera.
442,00:28:00.63,00:28:00.63,No messing around. Not better than what Rupert put
443,00:28:03.60,00:28:03.60,up. Ethan up for Mogo Mogo.
444,00:28:07.57,00:28:07.57,Nice shot. Not quite inside of Rupert's.
445,00:28:10.77,00:28:10.77,Boston Rob for Chapera. Nice shot.
446,00:28:16.53,00:28:16.53,Not enough. Comes down to the last shot for
447,00:28:18.50,00:28:18.50,Mogo Mogo. Lex.
448,00:28:19.87,00:28:19.87,"Two more arrows at stake, Lex. Got to get inside Rupert's toss,"
449,00:28:23.50,00:28:23.50,which means you have to be in the yellow.
450,00:28:26.80,00:28:26.80,"Nope, just outside. Chapera wins."
451,00:28:29.70,00:28:29.70,Both tribes move into the final round with three arrows.
452,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,">> Nice job, Rupert. >> PROBST: Moving into the final"
453,00:28:34.93,00:28:34.93,"round, each tribe has three arrows."
454,00:28:36.93,00:28:36.93,"You need to select your archers. Chapera, who's it going to be?"
455,00:28:40.03,00:28:40.03,Boston Rob. For Mogo Mogo?
456,00:28:42.53,00:28:42.53,"Jerri. Rock, paper, scissors to see who"
457,00:28:44.60,00:28:44.60,"shoots first. Rock, paper... you want to go"
458,00:28:49.57,00:28:49.57,"last, I assume? >> You go first."
459,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17,>> PROBST: Jerri's up first for Mogo Mogo.
460,00:28:53.50,00:28:53.50,You'll each have three arrows. Closest to the target wins
461,00:28:56.83,00:28:56.83,"immunity for your tribe. Jerri, any experience with a bow"
462,00:28:59.53,00:28:59.53,and arrow? >> Yes.
463,00:29:04.47,00:29:04.47,>> PROBST: Jerri misses just to the right.
464,00:29:06.57,00:29:06.57,"Boston Rob up for Chapera. >> Come on, Rob."
465,00:29:09.43,00:29:09.43,">> PROBST: Boston Rob, any previous experience with a bow"
466,00:29:11.60,00:29:11.60,"and arrow? >> Uh, my brother is a bow"
467,00:29:13.90,00:29:13.90,hunter. Tried to teach me a little bit
468,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,"before I left. >> Come on, Rob."
469,00:29:19.30,00:29:19.30,>> PROBST: Just to the left. Jerri shooting her second arrow.
470,00:29:26.97,00:29:26.97,Misses just to the right. Jerri down to her last arrow.
471,00:29:30.07,00:29:30.07,Boston Rob with his second arrow.
472,00:29:33.00,00:29:33.00,Still nobody has hit the target. Boston Rob on the target.
473,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,"Not a great shot, but you are on the board."
474,00:29:40.53,00:29:40.53,Jerri with the last shot for Mogo Mogo.
475,00:29:42.73,00:29:42.73,">> You got it, Jerri. >> PROBST: This is your last"
476,00:29:44.47,00:29:44.47,"arrow, Jerri. You've got to get inside Rob's"
477,00:29:46.43,00:29:46.43,hit. A lot of pressure.
478,00:29:48.27,00:29:48.27,"You don't get inside Rob's hit, Tribal Council tonight for Mogo"
479,00:29:51.23,00:29:51.23,Mogo. Somebody being voted out.
480,00:30:02.40,00:30:02.40,Wide to the right. That's it.
481,00:30:04.37,00:30:04.37,Chapera wins immunity. Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal
482,00:30:07.30,00:30:07.30,"Council. Chapera, once again, immunity"
483,00:30:10.73,00:30:10.73,going back to camp with you. Congratulations.
484,00:30:13.37,00:30:13.37,"Safe from the vote. Mogo Mogo, not as good news for"
485,00:30:17.97,00:30:17.97,you. Jerri stepped up into a make-or-
486,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,break position. Didn't work out.
487,00:30:21.70,00:30:21.70,You look frustrated. >> JERRI (drily): Really.
488,00:30:23.63,00:30:23.63,I wonder why. >> PROBST: The result is Tribal
489,00:30:25.60,00:30:25.60,Council tonight. Somebody's going home.
490,00:30:27.43,00:30:27.43,I'll see you there. You can head back to camp.
491,00:30:48.97,00:30:48.97,">> I'm just... I'm really sorry, you guys."
492,00:30:51.27,00:30:51.27,>> It happens. >> Don't beat yourself up.
493,00:30:54.13,00:30:54.13,">> I know, I'm trying not to, but it's hard."
494,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,>> Don't beat yourself up. Let's just get the fire going.
495,00:30:58.40,00:30:58.40,>> It's just hard not to. >> Is the fire on still?
496,00:31:01.90,00:31:01.90,>> We need a monsoon here. >> I don't want to go to
497,00:31:04.10,00:31:04.10,Tribal Council. >> But we got...
498,00:31:05.87,00:31:05.87,>> I'm pissed because I stuck my neck out.
499,00:31:08.57,00:31:08.57,And I blew it. I blew it.
500,00:31:12.60,00:31:12.60,I've lost the immunity challenge for everybody today.
501,00:31:15.50,00:31:15.50,The disappointment mixed with my fear of being blamed and voted
502,00:31:20.40,00:31:20.40,out tonight is just... overwhelming me.
503,00:31:27.13,00:31:27.13,">> (whispers): You talked to Kathy already, right?"
504,00:31:29.70,00:31:29.70,>> Not that much. >> So we're going to...
505,00:31:32.93,00:31:32.93,tonight we're going to... we're going to take Ethan out.
506,00:31:36.03,00:31:36.03,I think that strategically it just makes the most sense now.
507,00:31:38.93,00:31:38.93,Do you agree? >> Yeah.
508,00:31:40.93,00:31:40.93,">> I mean, he's just... >> I'm just... Yeah."
509,00:31:43.67,00:31:43.67,I'm just glad it's not me. >> Not you.
510,00:31:46.60,00:31:46.60,">> But if for some reason... >> No, it's... no."
511,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,"No, no, no, no. That's just completely just..."
512,00:31:52.23,00:31:52.23,don't even talk about it 'cause he may try to pull a Hail Mary
513,00:31:54.77,00:31:54.77,"move of some sort, and it's just not worth it for us."
514,00:31:57.63,00:31:57.63,We can stay in this game. You don't need to ask me about
515,00:32:00.07,00:32:00.07,"it, but it's Ethan tonight. >> Okay."
516,00:32:01.60,00:32:01.60,>> Okay. >> I won't say another word.
517,00:32:03.23,00:32:03.23,">> All right. Um, he's just... he's a charmer."
518,00:32:11.83,00:32:11.83,>> Yeah. >> He's a nice guy.
519,00:32:15.23,00:32:15.23,Um... it's dangerous. Ethan and I came into this game
520,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,"with a bit of a handicap, and that is that we have not just,"
521,00:32:22.27,00:32:22.27,you know... we're not just acquaintances outside the game.
522,00:32:25.33,00:32:25.33,We're good friends. I knew that the last thing he
523,00:32:29.43,00:32:29.43,wanted to have happen to him in this game was to be blindsided
524,00:32:31.80,00:32:31.80,and to get voted out without knowing about it ahead of time.
525,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,And I think the honorable thing to do here was to tell him when
526,00:32:37.77,00:32:37.77,it was going to happen. I've got my own agenda this
527,00:32:41.13,00:32:41.13,time; I've got my own plan. It doesn't include him.
528,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,I can't afford ballast; I can't afford dead weight; and I
529,00:32:47.07,00:32:47.07,certainly can't be dragging an ex-winner along with me just
530,00:32:49.50,00:32:49.50,because he's my friend. This isn't Africa.
531,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,This is All-Star. There are two things I need to
532,00:32:56.03,00:32:56.03,"talk to you about. I mean, one is the game."
533,00:32:58.50,00:32:58.50,And one is our friendship. And the two things... and I know
534,00:33:01.63,00:33:01.63,"it's hard for you at this point to see how one can, you know,"
535,00:33:05.20,00:33:05.20,"somehow exist separate from the other, but I'm going to try to"
536,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,make you understand how it has to be that way.
537,00:33:12.27,00:33:12.27,"Um, I think that at this point, it's just, it's better for my"
538,00:33:17.10,00:33:17.10,game if we vote you out tonight. But it has nothing to do
539,00:33:20.97,00:33:20.97,with friendship. This is business.
540,00:33:23.40,00:33:23.40,Strictly business. And I have to play the game
541,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"differently this time around, because the first time around,"
542,00:33:29.87,00:33:29.87,I lost. >> You have to play...
543,00:33:32.30,00:33:32.30,"Lex, as much as you say you want it, this is business, it's not."
544,00:33:35.20,00:33:35.20,>> It's not easy for me to tell you this 'cause I know how
545,00:33:37.70,00:33:37.70,disappointing this is. Am I having fun doing this? No.
546,00:33:40.57,00:33:40.57,Am I taking pleasure in telling you this? No.
547,00:33:42.70,00:33:42.70,"In fact, this is horrible. But I wanted... I wanted to talk"
548,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,"to you about this 'cause I didn't want to blindside you,"
549,00:33:48.03,00:33:48.03,"and I didn't think that it was right, I didn't think it was"
550,00:33:50.00,00:33:50.00,"fair, and I didn't think it was cool."
551,00:33:51.23,00:33:51.23,And I know... that it's a major drag for you to go out of the
552,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,"game for Jerri, and I understand that."
553,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,>> She's done nothing for this game; she's done nothing
554,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,for this tribe; she's done nothing for you; and you're
555,00:34:02.97,00:34:02.97,rewarding her with it. She does not deserve to be here.
556,00:34:05.67,00:34:05.67,She didn't lift a finger over there.
557,00:34:07.43,00:34:07.43,>> That's why. She's not much of a threat.
558,00:34:10.30,00:34:10.30,>> But she does not deserve to be here.
559,00:34:12.17,00:34:12.17,>> I know that. >> She does not deserve to be
560,00:34:14.27,00:34:14.27,here. >> Sorry.
561,00:34:20.40,00:34:20.40,"And, dude, I'm sorry. >> Don't apologize."
562,00:34:33.37,00:34:33.37,"What pisses me off the most is, if they think Jerri more worthy"
563,00:34:38.07,00:34:38.07,"to stay in this game than I am, then... that there's something"
564,00:34:43.87,00:34:43.87,"wrong with their screws in their head, and I don't know what game"
565,00:34:46.70,00:34:46.70,they're playing. Lex is like...
566,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,"I told Lex, you know, Jerri doesn't deserve to be here,"
567,00:35:00.70,00:35:00.70,"all that smack. He's, like, ""That's little stuff"
568,00:35:02.23,00:35:02.23,"to me."" He's, like, ""I don't care."""
569,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,"He's, like, ""I'll deal with that."""
570,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,Jerri's a vote I can... I can pull her along and get rid of
571,00:35:07.57,00:35:07.57,her whenever I want. She'll do anything I say.
572,00:35:10.57,00:35:10.57,That's... (grunts) (growls)
573,00:35:12.77,00:35:12.77,">> I know, I know. >> And she's gonna get"
574,00:35:15.73,00:35:15.73,further than you... >> No.
575,00:35:17.30,00:35:17.30,>> She might. There's no rhyme or reason of
576,00:35:19.83,00:35:19.83,how Lex is playing this game. There'll be no sense of security
577,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,"with Lex at any time. I mean, he told me that."
578,00:35:26.23,00:35:26.23,"I mean, he told me that over there, 'cause that's why he's"
579,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"voting me off. >> When I talked to Ethan,"
580,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,"and I looked into his eyes, you know, I truly would love"
581,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,to bring him with us. He is a nice guy.
582,00:35:36.53,00:35:36.53,He has a big heart. (whispering): I do not believe
583,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40,he'll bring me along for very long.
584,00:35:40.83,00:35:40.83,Because I don't trust anybody in this game.
585,00:35:43.53,00:35:43.53,But I don't want to take Lex out before Jerri.
586,00:35:46.07,00:35:46.07,>> No. >> It would be Jerri tonight.
587,00:35:48.00,00:35:48.00,"All right. >> So I'll vote for Jerri,"
588,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,"and then you and she can talk about it, and I'll..."
589,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03,"I'm a gambler. >> I'm leaning towards you,"
590,00:35:56.37,00:35:56.37,"believe me. I don't know, there's something,"
591,00:36:02.30,00:36:02.30,"again, about looking into Ethan's eyes and also looking"
592,00:36:04.63,00:36:04.63,into Lex's eyes. There is a moment that you need
593,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,to trust and have loyalty in this game.
594,00:36:08.90,00:36:08.90,You've got to. There is no way I want Jerri in
595,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,the final four. I just don't want her around.
596,00:36:15.47,00:36:15.47,"I want somebody, truly, that plays the game well, but also"
597,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,works. I want somebody with bug bites
598,00:36:20.67,00:36:20.67,on them and scratches and their fingers are gnarled.
599,00:36:23.77,00:36:23.77,I'm sorry. It's just the way I am.
600,00:36:25.53,00:36:25.53,"I've been thinking about it, but the sun's going down."
601,00:36:30.37,00:36:30.37,"I don't have much time. >> PROBST: Hello, guys."
602,00:36:52.10,00:36:52.10,Day 21. Let's talk about today's
603,00:36:54.57,00:36:54.57,"challenge. Jerri, you ended up in the hero-"
604,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"or-goat role, depending on how it came out."
605,00:37:00.47,00:37:00.47,Was that your choice? Were you elected?
606,00:37:02.73,00:37:02.73,"Was it random? >> I volunteered, um,"
607,00:37:07.23,00:37:07.23,"because I do have archery experience, and... my tribe"
608,00:37:11.60,00:37:11.60,"trusted and believed in me, and I let them down."
609,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"I apologize profusely. So regardless of the outcome, I"
610,00:37:20.93,00:37:20.93,"feel good about it. >> PROBST: Shii Ann, is there a"
611,00:37:23.23,00:37:23.23,"little bit of relief when somebody else steps up and says,"
612,00:37:25.53,00:37:25.53,"""I'll take that role,"" knowing that at least you can't be the"
613,00:37:28.57,00:37:28.57,goat? >> Today Jerri volunteered.
614,00:37:30.60,00:37:30.60,"I believed her. We all believed her, and"
615,00:37:33.83,00:37:33.83,"unfortunately, we lost. But that could have happened"
616,00:37:37.10,00:37:37.10,"with anyone. >> PROBST: Kathy, would Jerri be"
617,00:37:39.30,00:37:39.30,thinking irrationally if she was a little worried that maybe
618,00:37:41.87,00:37:41.87,tonight that challenge is gonna come back to haunt her?
619,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,">> You know, I'm sure she's concerned about it."
620,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,"You know, it'd be under my skin if I stepped forward like that."
621,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,"Especially now, when things are dwindling."
622,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"You know, it's human nature. I'm sure she's concerned."
623,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,">> PROBST: Ethan, has it crossed your mind that you're the last"
624,00:37:58.10,00:37:58.10,remaining previous winner in this game?
625,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,">> Yeah, it has. I like that."
626,00:38:03.37,00:38:03.37,"I'm proud of the way I played, and I'm happy that I'm still"
627,00:38:06.07,00:38:06.07,here. >> PROBST: What about you is the
628,00:38:07.80,00:38:07.80,biggest threat to the other four sitting here tonight?
629,00:38:11.23,00:38:11.23,">> I think, uh, I'm a threat to these other four"
630,00:38:13.47,00:38:13.47,"because, uh, I'm a winner. But in addition to that, that's"
631,00:38:18.60,00:38:18.60,"something they should look into, saying, ""Well, that's an"
632,00:38:21.13,00:38:21.13,"advantage as well."" No one's gonna vote for a winner"
633,00:38:24.40,00:38:24.40,"in the final two, Jeff. Principle alone, no one wants to"
634,00:38:26.77,00:38:26.77,"see a winner win again. >> PROBST: Lex, you kind of..."
635,00:38:28.87,00:38:28.87,had a weird reaction to that. >> I don't think that's
636,00:38:32.30,00:38:32.30,"necessarily true. In fact, if I was on the jury,"
637,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"and if that winner was shrewd enough to just make a good,"
638,00:38:37.57,00:38:37.57,"pointed argument that, ""You know what?"
639,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,I came into this game with the biggest target on my back.
640,00:38:42.20,00:38:42.20,"None of you figured I could ever get this far, and the fact that,"
641,00:38:45.73,00:38:45.73,"even against all odds, I made it to the final two,"" I'd have a"
642,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,hard time picking reasons not to vote him to win because that
643,00:38:52.87,00:38:52.87,guy made it against all odds. >> PROBST: Tough game.
644,00:38:58.23,00:38:58.23,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Touch decisions.
645,00:38:59.93,00:38:59.93,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: It is time to vote.
646,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,"Shii Ann, you're up. >> Jerri, um, today you took"
647,00:39:20.70,00:39:20.70,my life into your hands and you blew it.
648,00:39:24.10,00:39:24.10,I feel you've not played the game well; I feel you've not
649,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,worked hard enough; and I think you should be voted off.
650,00:39:42.83,00:39:42.83,">> It's really, really easy to win with grace and dignity,"
651,00:39:46.90,00:39:46.90,but it's much harder to lose with that same grace and
652,00:39:49.83,00:39:49.83,dignity. Let's see how you do.
653,00:40:08.83,00:40:08.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
654,00:40:27.20,00:40:27.20,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
655,00:40:29.03,00:40:29.03,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
656,00:40:31.17,00:40:31.17,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
657,00:40:35.03,00:40:35.03,First vote... E.Z. Ethan.
658,00:40:44.03,00:40:44.03,"Jerri. One vote Jerri, one vote Ethan."
659,00:40:49.80,00:40:49.80,"Ethan. That's two votes Ethan,"
660,00:40:51.20,00:40:51.20,one vote Jerri. Eighth person voted out of the
661,00:40:56.97,00:40:56.97,tribe... Ethan. Three's enough votes.
662,00:41:00.23,00:41:00.23,"You need to bring me your torch. Ethan, the tribe has spoken."
663,00:41:14.47,00:41:14.47,>> Have fun. Play hard. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
664,00:41:26.60,00:41:26.60,">> PROBST: Well, you've made it 21 days."
665,00:41:28.83,00:41:28.83,"With 18 days left, trust will become the single most valuable"
666,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,"resource in this game, and the most difficult thing to find."
667,00:41:36.87,00:41:36.87,See how it plays out. Grab your torches.

674,00:42:02.83,00:42:02.83,it's just depressing. >> PROBST: The gap between the

683,00:42:27.00,00:42:27.00,the game my way. Tonight I had no control over
684,00:42:29.73,00:42:29.73,"what happened. You know, I fought to the bitter"
