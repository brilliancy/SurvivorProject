225,00:16:35.83,00:16:35.83,working on the bait.Coby jumped up immediately and
226,00:16:38.04,00:16:38.04,"said, ""I'll work on the bait,""which was fine, and then he"
227,00:16:41.88,00:16:41.88,started suggesting that Ian alsostay and do the bait.
228,00:16:45.75,00:16:45.75,"Would one of the ladies like totry the bait catching, too?"
229,00:16:48.21,00:16:48.21,Three of us will go.Can you take three?

240,00:17:10.25,00:17:10.25,"back on the beach trying tocatch bait, at this point."
241,00:17:15.92,00:17:15.92, He belonged out there learninghow to fish and I spoke up.

247,00:17:34.33,00:17:34.33,complained that he was getting split off from the group again.
248,00:17:36.96,00:17:36.96,"It was just, he was being a painin the ass, like, come on."
249,00:17:39.54,00:17:39.54,Anyone want to catch fish?>> Yeah.

257,00:17:57.62,00:17:57.62,"I can do it myself.""So I walked off with the girls,"
258,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21," stomped off, and tried to dobait and I just don't want"
259,00:18:02.67,00:18:02.67,to see him again today. I hope he stays out there
260,00:18:05.50,00:18:05.50,"fishing for the rest of thenight, 'cause I don't want to"
261,00:18:08.83,00:18:08.83,see his face anymore for therest of the day.

374,00:24:22.38,00:24:22.38,playing the game.>> There you go.
375,00:24:25.54,00:24:25.54,>> Wow.>> Stephenie's going to add
376,00:24:28.79,00:24:28.79,"a whole new layer to the game,even though nobody thought she"
377,00:24:31.88,00:24:31.88,would.I will work Stephenie into this
378,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,game as hard as I can because Iwant Stephenie in.
379,00:24:36.67,00:24:36.67,"Stephenie's a true survivor,she lasted the longest in her"
380,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,tribe and she deservesto be in the top.

386,00:25:05.17,00:25:05.17,">> ... like, ""Let's talk aboutsomething."""
387,00:25:07.04,00:25:07.04,"Like, dude-- and it's so obviouswhat he's doing right now."
388,00:25:09.58,00:25:09.58,>> Yeah.>> They're all going to be so
389,00:25:11.58,00:25:11.58,mad.I don't give a...
390,00:25:13.12,00:25:13.12,I really don't care.>> That you're talking to me?
391,00:25:14.79,00:25:14.79,">> Yeah, because they knowwhat I'm doing, because I was so"
392,00:25:17.58,00:25:17.58,"bold about it.I did it on purpose, in front of"
393,00:25:19.25,00:25:19.25,"Katie, 'cause I'm sick,whatever, I'm so tired of their"
394,00:25:21.38,00:25:21.38,"attitude.Okay, so here's the main"
395,00:25:23.12,00:25:23.12,"alliance:Ian, Tom, Katie, Jennifer,"
396,00:25:25.25,00:25:25.25,"Gregg, the five of them.>> Okay."
397,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,">> Caryn, Janu and I are on theoutskirts 'cause Willard was in"
398,00:25:34.42,00:25:34.42,our group and then he was off.>> Okay.
399,00:25:37.46,00:25:37.46,>> But here's the secret part...>> Okay.
400,00:25:39.46,00:25:39.46,>> ... that you get to hear.Jennifer and Gregg really want
401,00:25:41.46,00:25:41.46,to turn against Tom and Ian.>> And Janu won't just
402,00:25:52.04,00:25:52.04,"quit now, especially right,like, they're going to vote me"
403,00:25:54.21,00:25:54.21,off?>> I don't know if it's you or
404,00:25:55.75,00:25:55.75,Janu.I know that Jennifer is your
405,00:25:58.12,00:25:58.12,main foe right now becauseJennifer is so jealous
406,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,of you.>> Is she?
407,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,">> Yeah, because, you know,every challenge we ever did"
408,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,y'all were pitted against eachother and you kicked her ass...
409,00:26:06.29,00:26:06.29,">> Oh, stop.>> ... and she's kind of bitter"
410,00:26:08.79,00:26:08.79,over it.>> Yeah.
411,00:26:09.50,00:26:09.50,">> The team's mentality, ofcourse, was to pick whoever"
412,00:26:11.79,00:26:11.79,"it was to come over, off.>> Keep it all Koror."
413,00:26:14.17,00:26:14.17,">> And keep it all Koror,but you're very well liked."
414,00:26:16.12,00:26:16.12,>> Aw...>> And so that's going to help
415,00:26:18.08,00:26:18.08,"and hurt you 'cause I think Tomand Ian really like you,"
416,00:26:20.46,00:26:20.46,"but Jennifer and them arethreatened, so I don't know"
417,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,which way they're going to go.>> Yeah.
418,00:26:24.17,00:26:24.17,>> Me and Stephenie havealways gotten along
419,00:26:26.08,00:26:26.08, and I think she reallyappreciated the fact that I was
420,00:26:28.29,00:26:28.29,talking to her strategy first.I knew that it would almost
421,00:26:30.71,00:26:30.71,be like claiming land;whoever got to her first
422,00:26:32.62,00:26:32.62,"would make a bigger impact,so I did it first."
423,00:26:34.88,00:26:34.88,"The second I got through talkingto Stephenie,"
424,00:26:36.92,00:26:36.92,Katie and Jennifer grabbed her--the second she walked back to
425,00:26:39.67,00:26:39.67,camp-- and they went and talkedto her.
426,00:26:41.67,00:26:41.67,That's all right.I talked to her first.
427,00:26:43.08,00:26:43.08,">> And he said, uh, it's Janu orme are going."
428,00:26:48.38,00:26:48.38,But he wants to keep me aroundas long as possible because he
429,00:26:51.29,00:26:51.29,"thinks I deserve to stay in thegame, but you guys are all"
430,00:26:54.25,00:26:54.25,jealous of me.(laughs)
431,00:26:58.21,00:26:58.21,>> That's great.>> Do you know what I'm talking
432,00:27:00.25,00:27:00.25,"about now? Like, where...>> Right, right."
433,00:27:02.38,00:27:02.38,>> Where does he come up withit?
434,00:27:04.17,00:27:04.17,">> And you guys want me to goand, um..."
435,00:27:06.25,00:27:06.25,>> No.>> So Steph talked to Coby
436,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25, and immediately came back overto me and told me everything
437,00:27:10.62,00:27:10.62,"that he said.She's, like, I want to make sure"
438,00:27:12.21,00:27:12.21,that I'm okay with you guys'cause we told her when we were
439,00:27:14.12,00:27:14.12,on the other tribe we're allokay.
440,00:27:15.75,00:27:15.75,"We're going to try and stickwith that as much as possible,"
441,00:27:18.58,00:27:18.58, but Jenn thinks she's a verybig threat.
442,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50," Coby has also told Stephthat Jenn wants to kick her out,"
443,00:27:23.33,00:27:23.33,"which isn't good.>> I mean, not that you're dead"
444,00:27:26.17,00:27:26.17,"man walking, there's otherpeople who are leaving here"
445,00:27:28.79,00:27:28.79,"before you, and, uh, you know...>> Means a lot."
446,00:27:33.42,00:27:33.42,">> Yeah.You know, I mean,"
447,00:27:35.00,00:27:35.00,"I wanted you to look, I wantedyou to still know that we're"
448,00:27:38.17,00:27:38.17,thinking of you and there's fourof us...
449,00:27:40.29,00:27:40.29,>> I'm so excited to be backhere.
450,00:27:43.71,00:27:43.71,"Do they still feel the same way?Oh, my God."
451,00:27:45.92,00:27:45.92,>> We'll look out for you as fardown the road as we can.
452,00:27:48.29,00:27:48.29,>> I would not...>> I can't tell you
453,00:27:49.88,00:27:49.88,the order of the vote or that Iknow what's going to happen in
454,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,the future...>> Right.
455,00:27:53.62,00:27:53.62,>> ... with the immunity.I'm just telling you you've got
456,00:27:55.54,00:27:55.54,friends on this tribe that aregoing to keep you alive.
457,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,">> That's so awesome.I come into this new tribe,"
458,00:28:00.33,00:28:00.33,"um, you know, one Ulong persongoing in this whole Koror tribe"
459,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,"that's stuck together thisentire time, and they tell me,"
460,00:28:06.96,00:28:06.96,"you know, ""Your head's not onthe chopping block, so don't"
461,00:28:09.62,00:28:09.62,"worry, you're not going to bevoted out."""
462,00:28:11.54,00:28:11.54,So I don't know what's going on.I don't know who to believe.
463,00:28:14.42,00:28:14.42,I don't know who to trust and Idon't know who to talk to.
464,00:28:17.17,00:28:17.17,"I almost don't want to talkto anybody, but then I might"
465,00:28:19.42,00:28:19.42,"shoot myself in the foot,so I've got to figure some"
466,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,"things out.>> PROBST: All right, you guys"

476,00:28:57.96,00:28:57.96,challenges will be individual.That means everybody's going
477,00:29:02.12,00:29:02.12,"to compete, and for some of youon Koror, that's going to be a"
478,00:29:05.12,00:29:05.12,real shock because a lot of youhave not competed in a lot of
479,00:29:08.00,00:29:08.00,these challenges.Immunity necklace around your

488,00:29:27.46,00:29:27.46,Last person left standing ontheir perch wins immunity.
489,00:29:31.21,00:29:31.21,"Immediately following thischallenge, we will go directly"
