4,00:00:13.21,00:00:13.21,18 Americans embarked on a journey to one of the most
5,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,"remote regions of Africa. Welcome to Survivor: Gabon,"
6,00:00:21.08,00:00:21.08,Earth's last Eden. The diverse group included
7,00:00:24.38,00:00:24.38,"a high school physics teacher, a world championship video game"
8,00:00:27.38,00:00:27.38,"player, and an Olympic athlete. >> I am a 2004 gold medalist in"
9,00:00:32.25,00:00:32.25,the women's 4 x 400-meter relay. >> PROBST: As they split into
10,00:00:35.46,00:00:35.46,"two tribes, Ace and Sugar connected right off the bat."
11,00:00:38.04,00:00:38.04,>> I don't think it would be appropriate for a photographer
12,00:00:40.17,00:00:40.17,"not to have a model. Sugar, please."
13,00:00:41.96,00:00:41.96,>> Oh! >> PROBST: The tribes were
14,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,"called Fang, in red, and, Kota, wearing yellow."
15,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,Go! They immediately raced for
16,00:00:50.58,00:00:50.58,individual immunity and extra food.
17,00:00:53.38,00:00:53.38,"Marcus has the idol for Kota. For Fang, GC grabs the idol."
18,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33,Fang lost the challenge by a landslide.
19,00:01:00.21,00:01:00.21,"Kota wins corn and beans! From the very beginning, Kota"
20,00:01:03.46,00:01:03.46,was a tribe that could do no wrong.
21,00:01:06.25,00:01:06.25,>> Our morale was super-high. We're all excited.
22,00:01:09.00,00:01:09.00,We love our team. >> PROBST: The yellow tribe
23,00:01:11.12,00:01:11.12,was in perfect harmony. >> I felt a little yoga would
24,00:01:14.17,00:01:14.17,"really get our energy flowing, the chakras would be all in"
25,00:01:17.25,00:01:17.25,time. >> PROBST: Almost.
26,00:01:19.54,00:01:19.54,>> Ace is kind of getting on my nerves.
27,00:01:22.04,00:01:22.04,">> PROBST: Kota's smallest tribe mate, Paloma, was making waves."
28,00:01:25.58,00:01:25.58,>> Ace is getting on my nerves. He does not shut up.
29,00:01:29.04,00:01:29.04,>> PROBST: But Kota's problems seem insignificant compared
30,00:01:32.04,00:01:32.04,"to Fang's. After only six days, the red"
31,00:01:35.21,00:01:35.21,tribe was starting to look like one of the worst tribes in
32,00:01:38.46,00:01:38.46,Survivor history. >> This tribe is hopeless.
33,00:01:42.58,00:01:42.58,They're idiots. >> PROBST: They lost an immunity
34,00:01:44.88,00:01:44.88,"challenge badly, and voted out one of their best athletes."
35,00:01:48.33,00:01:48.33,"They selected a tribe leader, GC, and he quit the next day."
36,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,>> I didn't want to be a leader. I'm not going to let y'all force
37,00:01:54.33,00:01:54.33,me to be the leader. >> PROBST: Gillian's not
38,00:01:56.17,00:01:56.17,helping. Fang is falling behind.
39,00:01:58.12,00:01:58.12,"They lost yet another immunity challenge, and then finally,"
40,00:02:01.17,00:02:01.17,they did something that was completely out of character.
41,00:02:04.25,00:02:04.25,They made a unified decision. They unanimously voted out their
42,00:02:07.67,00:02:07.67,"oldest and weakest player. Gillian, the tribe has spoken."
43,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,>> Bummer. >> PROBST: 16 are left.
44,00:02:14.21,00:02:14.21,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Thank God for another night.
45,00:02:27.04,00:02:27.04,">> Hell, yeah, man. Whatever happens, we made it"
46,00:02:29.25,00:02:29.25,"another night, you guys. >> Tribal Council was"
47,00:02:31.17,00:02:31.17,"a no-brainer. Gillian, you got to go."
48,00:02:33.58,00:02:33.58,We got rid of a major physical weak link.
49,00:02:37.83,00:02:37.83,>> Tomorrow is going to be a new day.
50,00:02:40.21,00:02:40.21,>> We got to win tomorrow. We have to.
51,00:02:42.08,00:02:42.08,(clamoring) >> And I don't care if it's
52,00:02:43.79,00:02:43.79,physical or whatever-- bring it on.
53,00:02:45.67,00:02:45.67,Ahh! Okay. (laughter)
54,00:02:48.50,00:02:48.50,">> I would like to start winning, but the tribe that I"
55,00:02:52.08,00:02:52.08,"have, I still don't believe it's possible."
56,00:02:55.08,00:02:55.08,>> Are you trying to break that? >> The problem is that they're
57,00:02:59.08,00:02:59.08,stupid. I really shouldn't blame them
58,00:03:01.25,00:03:01.25,"for being complete idiots, but they are."
59,00:03:03.25,00:03:03.25,"They don't know it, but, but they are."

65,00:04:44.96,00:04:44.96,Someone had the bright idea of three meals a day.
66,00:04:47.92,00:04:47.92,"You know, this is Survivor. Three meals a day?"
67,00:04:50.46,00:04:50.46,It's ridiculous. We're running low on rice.
68,00:04:53.96,00:04:53.96,"We're running out. It's not ""maybe."" It's a fact."
69,00:04:57.46,00:04:57.46,"I mean, I love three meals a day, but can we compromise"
70,00:05:02.17,00:05:02.17,at two? Two meals a day?
71,00:05:06.00,00:05:06.00,>> I can. >> I can.
72,00:05:07.21,00:05:07.21,">> I'm fine with two. >> I just, I don't know."
73,00:05:09.25,00:05:09.25,"I just think, uh, everybody was eating so much at first."
74,00:05:12.12,00:05:12.12,I remember throwing away a half a pot of rice the first
75,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,day. That wasted so much of our rice.
76,00:05:17.00,00:05:17.00,And now I'm suffering because some people chose to do that
77,00:05:19.71,00:05:19.71,early on. >> I'm not suffering.
78,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,">> I am. >> In my opinion, the cancer in"
79,00:05:26.38,00:05:26.38,the tribe is GC. He cannot be told anything.
80,00:05:29.83,00:05:29.83,And our tribe is going to continue to have problems until
81,00:05:33.04,00:05:33.04,"that cancer is excised. >> Randy, are you, like,"
82,00:05:36.38,00:05:36.38,the leader of the tribe now? >> No.
83,00:05:39.17,00:05:39.17,"We're just sitting here talking, dude."
84,00:05:40.50,00:05:40.50,">> I'm not... >> If you want to start, we'll"
85,00:05:42.50,00:05:42.50,"start it. >> It just seems like lately,"
86,00:05:44.04,00:05:44.04,"like the last couple of days, you kind of been trying to step"
87,00:05:46.71,00:05:46.71,up into the leadership role. I don't know if that's what you
88,00:05:48.62,00:05:48.62,"want to do, but you sure are jumpy about it."
89,00:05:50.29,00:05:50.29,">> No, we decided this tribe doesn't need a leader."
90,00:05:52.71,00:05:52.71,So what's your point? Are you asking me if I want
91,00:05:54.50,00:05:54.50,"to be leader? Okay, the answer's no."
92,00:05:56.54,00:05:56.54,"And, you know, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
93,00:05:58.71,00:05:58.71,"Drop it. >> I don't have to drop nothing,"
94,00:06:00.71,00:06:00.71,man. I can ask you something if I
95,00:06:02.29,00:06:02.29,want. >> And I can just ignore you
96,00:06:04.12,00:06:04.12,then. >> You can do that if you want.
97,00:06:06.54,00:06:06.54,>> I don't think we've pulled together as a team.
98,00:06:09.04,00:06:09.04,We'd have a much better chance if we were more unified and
99,00:06:13.04,00:06:13.04,"thinking of this as a team, rather than, you know, fighting"
100,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,"amongst each other. >> Oh, my God!"
101,00:06:33.71,00:06:33.71,>> Ooh! >> Whoo!
102,00:06:35.21,00:06:35.21,>> A fish. It's amazing.
103,00:06:37.04,00:06:37.04,>> Yay! >> Our hero.
104,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,">> My alliance right now is with Marcus, Corinne, and"
105,00:06:43.96,00:06:43.96,"Jacquie. Beyond that, I think Paloma and"
106,00:06:46.29,00:06:46.29,Kelly are really tight. And Sugar is attached to Ace.
107,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,"And I definitely think Bob is woo-able, and can be used as a"
108,00:06:53.88,00:06:53.88,swing vote. So there is always the concern
109,00:06:56.12,00:06:56.12,"that the other five might bond together, but I think the other"
110,00:07:00.38,00:07:00.38,"five are so all over the place, that we'll be able to keep the"
111,00:07:03.92,00:07:03.92,four together. >> It's his way or no way.
112,00:07:07.54,00:07:07.54,">> Like, right now, they're just, like, he's like the king,"
113,00:07:09.67,00:07:09.67,"and everybody's, like, bowing down to him."
114,00:07:11.46,00:07:11.46,I just want to gag every time he opens his mouth.
115,00:07:13.71,00:07:13.71,">> I know. >> Yeah, I know."

117,00:07:28.42,00:07:28.42,decided we had some kind of connection.
118,00:07:30.62,00:07:30.62,I trust Ace. And I believe that he's going
119,00:07:34.54,00:07:34.54,to take care of me as much as he can.
120,00:07:36.50,00:07:36.50,>> You guys! >> Tree mail!

195,00:11:40.96,00:11:40.96,This match looks a little more uneven with Crystal and Randy
196,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,on the very small Paloma. This could be over quickly.
197,00:11:50.58,00:11:50.58,>> You're done! You're done.
198,00:11:52.08,00:11:52.08,>> PROBST: Randy and Crystal have Paloma off the post very

201,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,You're done. >> PROBST: Fang scores!

206,00:12:13.50,00:12:13.50,We're back to the original match-up: Ace and Dan on the
207,00:12:16.67,00:12:16.67,poles. The attackers are different
208,00:12:18.50,00:12:18.50,this time. Marcus and Bob attacking for
209,00:12:21.62,00:12:21.62,Kota. And Crystal and Matty are the
210,00:12:24.50,00:12:24.50,attackers for Fang. This is a final round.
211,00:12:27.42,00:12:27.42,Playing for reward. Kota would like to make sure
212,00:12:30.88,00:12:30.88,Fang does not taste victory. Fang is desperate for a victory.
213,00:12:35.75,00:12:35.75,Survivors ready? Go!
214,00:12:39.25,00:12:39.25,"This is it right here. >> Come on, Crystal!"

218,00:12:52.42,00:12:52.42,"Which tribe wants it more? >> Crystal, we need this win!"
219,00:12:58.04,00:12:58.04,>> PROBST: Matty has the top half of Ace off of the post.

226,00:13:21.75,00:13:21.75,Ace trying to get away. A big takedown!
227,00:13:25.71,00:13:25.71,This is a war. Bob and Marcus fighting hard on
228,00:13:28.92,00:13:28.92,Dan. Crystal's starting to drag
229,00:13:31.04,00:13:31.04,Ace again. Fang getting closer to their
230,00:13:33.29,00:13:33.29,first victory! Dan fighting them off.
231,00:13:37.54,00:13:37.54,>> Don't give up! >> PROBST: Ace knocks Crystal
232,00:13:39.46,00:13:39.46,down. >> Crystal!

235,00:13:49.62,00:13:49.62,Matty now pulling Ace. Who's got more will?
236,00:13:54.21,00:13:54.21,You got to cross the plane. You got to get him across.
237,00:13:57.88,00:13:57.88,Fang wins reward! (cheering)
238,00:14:00.21,00:14:00.21,>> Yeah! >> Yes!
239,00:14:03.04,00:14:03.04,">> Good job! >> One, two, three-- Fang!"
240,00:14:10.12,00:14:10.12,">> PROBST: Fang, congratulations."
241,00:14:12.04,00:14:12.04,"Crystal, you look very emotional."
242,00:14:14.21,00:14:14.21,>> We had to go out here and fight like warriors in order to
243,00:14:16.88,00:14:16.88,"get some blankets and some comfort, but it was worth it."
244,00:14:19.46,00:14:19.46,">> PROBST: Fang, big decision to make."
245,00:14:21.25,00:14:21.25,Who are you going to send from Kota to go to Exile Island?
246,00:14:24.25,00:14:24.25,>> We're going to go with someone sweet.
247,00:14:26.46,00:14:26.46,So we're going to pick Sugar. >> I knew that.
248,00:14:28.67,00:14:28.67,>> PROBST: How'd you know that? >> I knew that.
249,00:14:30.50,00:14:30.50,I knew that they were going to pick me 'cause they think
250,00:14:32.54,00:14:32.54,"I'm dumb, but they haven't talked to me yet."
251,00:14:34.17,00:14:34.17,">> PROBST: Well, the bad news for you, Sugar, you're going"
252,00:14:35.92,00:14:35.92,"to be away from camp, and as you know, that's never a good thing."
253,00:14:38.46,00:14:38.46,">> I know. >> PROBST: The good news is,"
254,00:14:40.17,00:14:40.17,"waiting for you on Exile, a clue to the location of a hidden"

258,00:14:52.00,00:14:52.00,"Head back to camp. All right, Fang, nice job."
259,00:14:55.88,00:14:55.88,Get your reward. Head on out.
260,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,>> Hammock. (cheering)
261,00:15:28.04,00:15:28.04,">> Nice. Everybody, nice."
262,00:15:30.42,00:15:30.42,">> Good job, man. That challenge felt so good."
263,00:15:34.17,00:15:34.17,It felt good for the other tribe to feel the pain that we
264,00:15:37.92,00:15:37.92,have been feeling to walk away with your heads down.
265,00:15:41.50,00:15:41.50,>> How fun is winning? How awesome is it to come back
266,00:15:44.04,00:15:44.04,winning? >> You held on.

268,00:15:48.58,00:15:48.58,"Matty and from you. Coming back into camp, we were"
269,00:15:51.54,00:15:51.54,feeling like a team. Finally feeling like we're
270,00:15:55.17,00:15:55.17,going to start creating a little bit of a roll here.
271,00:15:57.62,00:15:57.62,I was losing it and you heard me yelling.
272,00:15:59.21,00:15:59.21,">> I'm all, ""Come on, bitch! Come on, bitch!"""
273,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,"(laughter) >> No, you guys did awesome."

276,00:16:14.50,00:16:14.50,">> But we did take out our strongest girls, you know?"
277,00:16:17.50,00:16:17.50,"I mean, it was a great, great decision."
278,00:16:19.71,00:16:19.71,>> That was such a brilliant strategy.
279,00:16:21.25,00:16:21.25,">> It's hard when, like... I mean, their three strongest,"
280,00:16:23.42,00:16:23.42,"and one of the them was the girl, it's like..."
281,00:16:25.67,00:16:25.67,>> Yeah. >> No.

283,00:16:32.04,00:16:32.04,"team, is huge. Especially compared to me."
284,00:16:34.04,00:16:34.04,"Like, I'm the shortest person alive, so compared to Crystal,"
285,00:16:37.92,00:16:37.92,"like, I mean, I just had no chance."
286,00:16:39.79,00:16:39.79,"It was kind of weird that, like, Ace decided to put me on"
287,00:16:42.50,00:16:42.50,"the pole instead of Sugar, but, like with Ace, it's kind of"
288,00:16:45.04,00:16:45.04,like it's his way or the highway.
289,00:16:46.92,00:16:46.92,>> We should have put Kelly in instead of Paloma.
290,00:16:49.17,00:16:49.17,I'm not sure why we sat the three of you guys out.
291,00:16:52.08,00:16:52.08,>> It would have been fine to put her in for a puzzle or
292,00:16:54.92,00:16:54.92,"something, but... >> Yeah, but what if it wasn't"
293,00:16:56.33,00:16:56.33,"a puzzle? >> Yeah, that's..."
294,00:16:59.83,00:16:59.83,>> That's fine. >> We're short two pillows.
295,00:17:01.83,00:17:01.83,>> Big deal. >> We'll be fine.
296,00:17:04.42,00:17:04.42,">> It's not fine when it's, like, we still have to catch"
297,00:17:06.71,00:17:06.71,"fish for her and catch fish for her tonight, and keep the traps"
298,00:17:10.21,00:17:10.21,"and do all the other stuff. It's, like, I don't know, we're"
299,00:17:12.29,00:17:12.29,just stuck with Paloma. >> Yeah.
300,00:17:13.67,00:17:13.67,">> It was a bit hard, you know, watching Paloma just give up."
301,00:17:16.88,00:17:16.88,"Yeah, I think her lack of, um... motivation, let's say, just sort"
302,00:17:22.00,00:17:22.00,of sealed what we were all thinking already.
303,00:17:24.42,00:17:24.42,"Sort of crossed and dotted the ""T""s on her contract of death."
304,00:17:28.04,00:17:28.04,"So whatever. >> ""In this garden of Eden,"
305,00:17:50.21,00:17:50.21,a difficult choice you'll face. One choice provides an apple.
306,00:17:53.96,00:17:53.96,One choice provides direction. Spend your time in idle comfort

308,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,"Getting in that cage and having comfort, it would have been"
309,00:18:02.71,00:18:02.71,nice. But it would have been really
310,00:18:04.62,00:18:04.62,stupid because I'm pretty sure since I'm only the second person
311,00:18:08.46,00:18:08.46,"sent to Exile Island, that the idol is still out there."
312,00:18:12.04,00:18:12.04,"""Across the lake you see so well, there lies a sandy crater."

316,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
317,00:18:40.62,00:18:40.62,Oh! (screams)
318,00:18:47.79,00:18:47.79,"This is not my normal thing, obviously."
319,00:18:50.33,00:18:50.33,I'm not a camper. I don't like to be dirty.
320,00:18:57.92,00:18:57.92,"I think I've gone too far. This time, I've gone too far."
321,00:19:04.17,00:19:04.17,Yeah... I'm lost. I did Survivor 'cause I thought
322,00:19:09.04,00:19:09.04,it might help me grow up a little bit and get a thicker
323,00:19:12.04,00:19:12.04,"skin, and get over... not get over, but deal with..."
324,00:19:18.38,00:19:18.38,my father's death-- I can't even say it.
325,00:19:21.79,00:19:21.79,My father passed away seven months ago.

328,00:19:30.46,00:19:30.46,I'm sure I'll be a stronger person by the end of it all.
329,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,Playing this game will help me at this time in my life.
330,00:19:41.38,00:19:41.38,"Oh, thank God! (laughs)"
331,00:20:00.79,00:20:00.79,"Holy... Oh, my God."
332,00:20:04.88,00:20:04.88,Did I find... the thing? Or is this a joke?

352,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67,I'm going over to that tree. 'Cause it looks like it might
353,00:21:30.58,00:21:30.58,"have some good hiding spots. Oh, my God."

355,00:21:49.29,00:21:49.29,(groans) That was so scary.

359,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,"was dumb, and that I'd never find the idol, no way."
360,00:22:12.83,00:22:12.83,I can't believe I found it and the lawyer didn't.
361,00:22:15.42,00:22:15.42,How funny is that? That's funny.
362,00:22:18.25,00:22:18.25,"But my dad's been with me this whole time, so I feel like he's"

370,00:23:08.92,00:23:08.92,this game. You know that.
371,00:23:10.12,00:23:10.12,>> Yeah. >> I think we can trust Sugar

373,00:23:16.92,00:23:16.92,at risk by doing this manipulation.
374,00:23:19.21,00:23:19.21,"By calling out Paloma, he's protecting Sugar big-time."
375,00:23:22.50,00:23:22.50,He wants to keep Sugar. I can see why.

377,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83,can irritate people and it worries people.

380,00:23:43.00,00:23:43.00,">> Or Sugar, then Paloma. I mean, they're going."
381,00:23:44.29,00:23:44.29,Ace is doing something very stupid.
382,00:23:46.12,00:23:46.12,He's bringing Sugar to the end because she's weak.
383,00:23:47.92,00:23:47.92,She needs him. I'll tell you this much.
384,00:23:49.79,00:23:49.79,"I have, you know, Jacquie, Marcus, Charlie."
385,00:23:52.33,00:23:52.33,"You know, we're all in your book."
386,00:23:54.29,00:23:54.29,"As long as, you know, you feel the same way we do, we're all"
387,00:23:57.08,00:23:57.08,in it together. >> Yeah.
388,00:23:58.58,00:23:58.58,>> And there's five of us. So it's... we can pick whoever
389,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,we want. We are in the majority.
390,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,"I think Bob responds really well to bold, confident moves."
391,00:24:05.79,00:24:05.79,"When I was speaking to him, I had to speak to him like,"
392,00:24:08.25,00:24:08.25,"""Here's the deal. These are the four."
393,00:24:09.79,00:24:09.79,You're the fifth. That's all you need to know.
394,00:24:11.12,00:24:11.12,"It's the majority. We're getting rid of this one."""
395,00:24:12.92,00:24:12.92,That's it. And it doesn't really matter
396,00:24:14.79,00:24:14.79,'cause we're five. So lock it down.
397,00:24:17.58,00:24:17.58,That's it. >> Good point.
398,00:24:18.79,00:24:18.79,>> None of us are looking to take Bob to the end.
399,00:24:21.00,00:24:21.00,"However, we need him for numbers, and I think that we can"
400,00:24:23.58,00:24:23.58,trust him. >> Tree mail.
401,00:24:25.62,00:24:25.62,">> ""Slip, slide, splash and run. The stakes are high, but you'll"
402,00:24:28.92,00:24:28.92,have some fun. Who is bright and who is slow?
403,00:24:32.29,00:24:32.29,"Know the difference or be the next to go."""
404,00:24:34.67,00:24:34.67,">> Oh, no! >> (gasps): Yay!"
405,00:24:36.08,00:24:36.08,>> Yay! I knew our swimsuits were
406,00:24:37.83,00:24:37.83,in there! >> Yay!
407,00:24:40.62,00:24:40.62,>> I think the next immunity challenge is the most crucial
408,00:24:43.83,00:24:43.83,one that we've had at this point.
409,00:24:45.71,00:24:45.71,Their one victory has given them some hope.
410,00:24:47.92,00:24:47.92,Crushing that hope is going to send them to another level of
411,00:24:50.62,00:24:50.62,"despair. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
412,00:25:04.62,00:25:04.62,"We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile Island."
413,00:25:07.21,00:25:07.21,">> Sugar. >> Hey, babe."
414,00:25:09.25,00:25:09.25,>> Oh! That was really wrong.
415,00:25:12.71,00:25:12.71,>> I know. >> PROBST: Don't look at me.
416,00:25:16.88,00:25:16.88,I didn't send you. It's the game.
417,00:25:19.38,00:25:19.38,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity"
418,00:25:21.46,00:25:21.46,challenge? >> Yeah.
419,00:25:22.88,00:25:22.88,>> PROBST: First things first. I will take it back again.
420,00:25:28.79,00:25:28.79,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
421,00:25:32.25,00:25:32.25,"For today's challenge, one at a time, you will launch yourself"
422,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,down a slippery slide and into the water.
423,00:25:39.25,00:25:39.25,You'll then swim out to retrieve a covered number tile
424,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,and race back. Once you've collected all six
425,00:25:45.21,00:25:45.21,"tiles, the remaining tribe member will use those numbered"
426,00:25:49.00,00:25:49.00,tiles to solve a math puzzle. The answer will reveal the
427,00:25:53.29,00:25:53.29,combination to a chest. First tribe to open their
428,00:25:57.29,00:25:57.29,chest and raise their tribe flag... wins immunity.
429,00:26:02.88,00:26:02.88,"Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be going home."
430,00:26:05.92,00:26:05.92,"Kota, you have two extra members."
431,00:26:07.71,00:26:07.71,Who's going to sit out this one? Paloma and Sugar.
432,00:26:10.79,00:26:10.79,I'll also give you a minute to strategize.
433,00:26:12.62,00:26:12.62,"We'll get started. All right, Bob and Ken are"
434,00:26:19.21,00:26:19.21,waiting to solve puzzle. Everybody else is going down
435,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,"the slide. For immunity, survivors ready?"
436,00:26:26.00,00:26:26.00,Go! It's Crystal and Kelly first
437,00:26:28.04,00:26:28.04,down. Kelly does it perfectly.
438,00:26:30.88,00:26:30.88,Crystal takes a hard hit. Both are in the water at the
439,00:26:35.92,00:26:35.92,same time. Crystal's tall enough she can
440,00:26:38.83,00:26:38.83,actually run to get her first puzzle piece.
441,00:26:41.83,00:26:41.83,">> Come on, Kelly! >> PROBST: Kelly coming back."
442,00:26:44.04,00:26:44.04,">> Come on, Crystal! >> Run!"
443,00:26:46.58,00:26:46.58,>> PROBST: Crystal out of the water first for Fang.
444,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,">> Run, Crystal, run! >> PROBST: Susie on the course."
445,00:26:53.58,00:26:53.58,">> Come on, Kel. >> PROBST: Fang with a"
446,00:26:56.42,00:26:56.42,good-sized lead right off the bat.
447,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,Corinne hits the course. >> That was awesome!
448,00:27:05.79,00:27:05.79,">> Come on, Susie! >> PROBST: Susie has the second"
449,00:27:09.21,00:27:09.21,piece to this puzzle. Corinne quickly gets her number.
450,00:27:13.29,00:27:13.29,She's heading back. Making up a lot of time on
451,00:27:16.50,00:27:16.50,"Susie. >> Come on, Sue, faster!"
452,00:27:18.79,00:27:18.79,>> You got it! You got it!
453,00:27:20.38,00:27:20.38,>> PROBST: Fang has lost all of their lead now.
454,00:27:23.83,00:27:23.83,"Charlie on the course for Kota. >> Yeah, Charlie!"
455,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,>> PROBST: Kota now has the lead.
456,00:27:30.04,00:27:30.04,">> Yeah, Charlie! >> PROBST: GC on the course"
457,00:27:33.21,00:27:33.21,for Fang. That's how you do it.
458,00:27:38.04,00:27:38.04,"Charlie out of the water, heading back for Kota."
459,00:27:41.04,00:27:41.04,"Kota has three tiles back. Fang, still with two."
460,00:27:45.83,00:27:45.83,Kota still with a good-sized lead.
461,00:27:50.71,00:27:50.71,"Randy on the course for Fang. >> Come on, Randy!"
462,00:27:56.75,00:27:56.75,>> PROBST: Jacquie out of the water for Kota.
463,00:27:59.29,00:27:59.29,Two numbers left. Ace flips over twice.
464,00:28:07.21,00:28:07.21,Randy needs to pick it up. Fang has lost more time.
465,00:28:12.25,00:28:12.25,Dan on the course for Fang. Still looking to win that first
466,00:28:15.08,00:28:15.08,immunity challenge. Ace holding on to Kota's lead.
467,00:28:19.08,00:28:19.08,>> Ace! >> PROBST: Kota has one number
468,00:28:21.25,00:28:21.25,left in the water. Fang has two more left.
469,00:28:25.88,00:28:25.88,A big launch. Marcus heading out for that
470,00:28:29.25,00:28:29.25,sixth and final number for Kota. Dan finally out of the water
471,00:28:33.92,00:28:33.92,for Fang. Matty's going to have to make
472,00:28:36.88,00:28:36.88,up a lot of time. Marcus out of the water with
473,00:28:42.21,00:28:42.21,the sixth and final number for Kota.
474,00:28:45.79,00:28:45.79,It's now up to Bob to solve the puzzle.
475,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,">> Okay, Bob! You can do it!"
476,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,>> PROBST: Matty out of the water with that sixth and final
477,00:28:54.75,00:28:54.75,"number. >> Go, Ken!"
478,00:28:57.79,00:28:57.79,">> PROBST: Ken racing now, trying to catch up."
479,00:28:59.83,00:28:59.83,Got a physics teacher going head-to-head with a video game
480,00:29:02.25,00:29:02.25,expert. You don't need to be a math
481,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,major to figure this out. You just need to be able to
482,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,concentrate. Read it carefully.
483,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,"Rearrange the numbers. ""The sum of both end values will"
484,00:29:14.12,00:29:14.12,equal the sum of the middle two. The last number is equal to the
485,00:29:18.25,00:29:18.25,"second, minus the third, and is one less than the one before"
486,00:29:21.92,00:29:21.92,"it."" >> Do it! Do it, then!"
487,00:29:25.71,00:29:25.71,Try it! >> PROBST: Bob thinks he might
488,00:29:27.25,00:29:27.25,have it. Make those numbers into a
489,00:29:28.88,00:29:28.88,"combination. If you're right, the chest will"
490,00:29:30.83,00:29:30.83,"open. No, he doesn't have it."
491,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,>> I think I got it. >> PROBST: Ken thinks he has it.
492,00:29:42.25,00:29:42.25,Ken tries it. He's not right.
493,00:29:44.04,00:29:44.04,Try to look at this puzzle again.
494,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,Maybe you're putting a comma where it doesn't belong or
495,00:29:48.88,00:29:48.88,"reading a word wrong. >> Oh, are these the end values?"
496,00:29:55.50,00:29:55.50,>> PROBST: Bob thinks he might have figured it out suddenly.
497,00:29:59.92,00:29:59.92,">> I think I got it, Jeff. >> PROBST: Ken thinks he has it"
498,00:30:02.42,00:30:02.42,"again. >> I do, too."
499,00:30:04.58,00:30:04.58,>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it. Both tribes trying it.
500,00:30:08.62,00:30:08.62,"Either one of these guys are right, immunity for their tribe."
501,00:30:12.67,00:30:12.67,">> Pull the damn handle, Bob! >> PROBST: Bob tries it."
502,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,"He's wrong, once again. Ken has it right for Fang."
503,00:30:28.79,00:30:28.79,Fang wins immunity! (cheers)
504,00:30:32.04,00:30:32.04,">> We did it! >> Oh, my God!"
505,00:30:37.21,00:30:37.21,>> That's simple math. >> Fang!
506,00:30:41.79,00:30:41.79,">> PROBST: Fang, congratulations."
507,00:30:43.21,00:30:43.21,Back-to-back wins. This time for immunity.
508,00:30:46.42,00:30:46.42,This game is changing. (applause)
509,00:30:49.42,00:30:49.42,"Kota, date with me tonight at Tribal Council where the third"
510,00:30:52.79,00:30:52.79,person will be voted out of this game.
511,00:30:54.83,00:30:54.83,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
512,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,"I will see you at Tribal. Fang, you guys going to miss me"
513,00:31:00.46,00:31:00.46,at Tribal Council? >> You need to get to know them
514,00:31:02.62,00:31:02.62,a little bit better. >> PROBST: Grab your stuff.
515,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,Head back to camp. >> But the clues are not
516,00:31:33.29,00:31:33.29,"freaking easy. I had to find my way through,"
517,00:31:35.71,00:31:35.71,"like, a big desert. Saw a spot with this map"
518,00:31:39.12,00:31:39.12,and I kind of read it wrong or something.
519,00:31:41.92,00:31:41.92,I think I played off the fact that I won the idol pretty
520,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,well. I don't think anybody has
521,00:31:46.88,00:31:46.88,a clue that I got it. I'm not too bad at this.
522,00:31:50.71,00:31:50.71,"I'm a lot better than I thought, for sure."
523,00:31:59.83,00:31:59.83,">> So I can hang on to this thing for a while, maybe."
524,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,">> Yeah, hang on to it. I mean, I'd obviously, not"
525,00:32:04.12,00:32:04.12,"bring it to Tribal tonight, but I mean, I'd bring it to"
526,00:32:06.54,00:32:06.54,Tribal generally. >> I just had a very nice
527,00:32:17.08,00:32:17.08,"conversation in the canoe, being told that Sugar has the"
528,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,immunity idol. And we're going to hopefully
529,00:32:23.46,00:32:23.46,dominate this game. >> Paloma tonight.
530,00:32:27.12,00:32:27.12,">> Paloma's dead. >> Yeah, okay."
531,00:32:29.04,00:32:29.04,">> Um, Kelly's pretty dead after that."
532,00:32:31.00,00:32:31.00,>> Awesome. I'm pretty excited.
533,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,">> Now, we're all prepping for the coupe de grace, being"
534,00:32:37.67,00:32:37.67,"Tribal Council, and the dismissal of little Miss Paloma."
535,00:32:56.67,00:32:56.67,">> Strategically, I'm, like, the animals out in the wilds."
536,00:32:59.88,00:32:59.88,"I just watch. Just watch, and then I'm going"
537,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,to pounce on someone and eat them up.
538,00:33:08.75,00:33:08.75,Has Ace made an alliance with you yet?
539,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,He's made an alliance with everybody else.
540,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,>> He has? >> Mm-hmm.
541,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,>> He's not said one word to me. >> Mm-hmm.
542,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,He's not said one to me 'cause he doesn't like me.
543,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"I mean, he's trying everything he can to get rid of me, like"
544,00:33:20.04,00:33:20.04,putting me on the pole instead of Sugar.
545,00:33:21.71,00:33:21.71,"Anyway, think about it. He doesn't want to get rid of"
546,00:33:23.79,00:33:23.79,"Sugar. Ace doesn't want to, and Ace"
547,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,is pretty much running the game. >> Hmm.
548,00:33:28.12,00:33:28.12,>> It's really crazy. Just keep your eyes out because
549,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,"he's really, really sneaky. Like, I'll just say what I need"
550,00:33:32.88,00:33:32.88,to say really fast till I get people to think and get their
551,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,"brains going and make them, like, all crazy and, like,"
552,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,"thinking. Ace might be, you know, strong"
553,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,"as an ox and I might be as weak as a mouse, but we're both"
554,00:33:44.79,00:33:44.79,50/50. People want him out because
555,00:33:46.46,00:33:46.46,he's strong. People might want me out because
556,00:33:48.46,00:33:48.46,"we're weak. >> He's not running the show,"
557,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"Paloma. >> Well, I mean, not..."
558,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,"I mean, personally, I don't really care."
559,00:33:53.50,00:33:53.50,"I can't stand the guy. >> Well, let me see what I can"
560,00:33:54.88,00:33:54.88,think up. That's not happening.
561,00:33:56.79,00:33:56.79,I really can't stand Ace. I'm not sure that that accent is
562,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,real. I think he's a con artist. 
563,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,I would like it see him go home sooner rather than later.
564,00:34:04.71,00:34:04.71,I am afraid if Ace goes with us to the merge he will be the
565,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,first one to flip because he's on the outskirts of our
566,00:34:09.75,00:34:09.75,alliance. So I went on a walk with
567,00:34:11.38,00:34:11.38,Paloma. >> Yeah?

569,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,"And she was like, ""Ace is really dangerous."""
570,00:34:17.92,00:34:17.92,"She goes ""The only reason why Ace made a point to force me to"
571,00:34:21.12,00:34:21.12,go on the post is so that everyone could see how bad I

580,00:34:35.38,00:34:35.38,Ace needs to get out of here before the merge because we
581,00:34:37.25,00:34:37.25,can't have that. >> You're smart at this game.
582,00:34:40.08,00:34:40.08,There definitely is a short-term benefit to getting rid of our
583,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"weakest players because then we can trounce, you know, the other"
584,00:34:46.71,00:34:46.71,team and not have to vote off other people.
585,00:34:48.62,00:34:48.62,But Ace is the biggest concern because Ace has been playing
586,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,"Sugar like a pawn. >> ""I'm taking her to the end"

591,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,earlier before he gains momentum before we merge.
592,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,That's more important. I don't know. It's hard to say.
593,00:35:17.04,00:35:17.04,"I dislike so many people on this damn tribe that it's like,"
594,00:35:19.75,00:35:19.75,it's a toss-up. >> PROBST: Behind each of you

597,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,"Tribal Council because in this game, fire represents your life."
598,00:35:50.54,00:35:50.54,"As long as you have fire, you are still in the game."

603,00:36:07.96,00:36:07.96,"opinion of who should be voted out, but the idea is that you"
604,00:36:11.25,00:36:11.25,"want one opinion together, so that you have as little"
605,00:36:13.96,00:36:13.96,dissension among the group as possible.
606,00:36:16.29,00:36:16.29,">> PROBST: Ace, that seems incredibly pie-in-the-sky."

614,00:36:41.58,00:36:41.58,I thought about my dad. Damn it.
615,00:36:45.38,00:36:45.38,"Just because I lost my dad recently, and..."

618,00:36:58.88,00:36:58.88,"to play in regards to the idol. One is ""Don't try to flush it"
619,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,"out 'cause I don't have it."" The other is, ""I got it."""
620,00:37:05.12,00:37:05.12,">> You're absolutely right. I mean, I think Sugar's"

623,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,"know, if that's the case, more power to her."
624,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,It's probably the way I would play it myself.
625,00:37:17.17,00:37:17.17,">> PROBST: When you got with this group, who jumped out at"
626,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,"you you as, wow, interesting. >> Um, I think our tribe"

629,00:37:29.29,00:37:29.29,well together and have a lot of similar ideas.

633,00:37:38.92,00:37:38.92,">> PROBST: How do you feel about that, him being the big guy?"
634,00:37:41.38,00:37:41.38,">> I mean, like, he can be the big guy all he wants."
635,00:37:43.71,00:37:43.71,"I really could care less. But, I mean, as far as I'm"
636,00:37:47.08,00:37:47.08,"concerned, I'm not even going to go there."

642,00:38:02.12,00:38:02.12,>> Not particularly. I think we have the capacity to

644,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,"Ace is an asset to your tribe? >> Um, in some cases, because"
645,00:38:11.50,00:38:11.50,he's almost condescending in a way.
646,00:38:14.25,00:38:14.25,>> PROBST: How is condescending a good thing?
647,00:38:15.96,00:38:15.96,>> It's not a good thing at all sometimes.
648,00:38:18.08,00:38:18.08,"Um, say, we're cooking rice or something, he'll be like, ""Oh,"
649,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,"I thought we were going to make water."""
650,00:38:22.42,00:38:22.42,"Like, if somebody wants to make rice, let us make rice."

669,00:39:33.96,00:39:33.96,"self-explanatory. >> Unfortunately, you know"
670,00:39:48.79,00:39:48.79,exactly why you're leaving. It's for the strength of the
671,00:39:51.50,00:39:51.50,tribe. Best of luck.

676,00:40:29.92,00:40:29.92,decision is final. The person voted out will be
677,00:40:31.54,00:40:31.54,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
678,00:40:33.79,00:40:33.79,I'll read the votes. First vote: Paloma.
679,00:40:43.29,00:40:43.29,Ace. One vote Paloma; one vote Ace.
680,00:40:48.33,00:40:48.33,Ace. Two votes Ace; one vote Paloma.
681,00:40:54.46,00:40:54.46,Paloma. We're tied: two votes Paloma;
682,00:40:57.92,00:40:57.92,two votes Ace. Paloma.
683,00:41:03.21,00:41:03.21,Three votes Paloma; two votes Ace.
684,00:41:10.00,00:41:10.00,Paloma. That's four votes Paloma;
685,00:41:12.12,00:41:12.12,two votes Ace. Third person voted out of
686,00:41:17.50,00:41:17.50,Survivor: Gabon: Paloma. That's five.
687,00:41:19.62,00:41:19.62,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
688,00:41:31.17,00:41:31.17,">> Paloma, the tribe has spoken. Well, the truth is, you've lost"
689,00:41:48.75,00:41:48.75,"back-to-back challenges, and now your first tribe member."
690,00:41:52.04,00:41:52.04,"Fang clearly has the momentum. Question is, can you get it"
691,00:41:55.50,00:41:55.50,back? Grab your torches.
692,00:41:57.08,00:41:57.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
