383,00:23:49.79,00:23:49.79,"I have, you know, Jacquie,Marcus, Charlie."
384,00:23:52.33,00:23:52.33,"You know, we're all in yourbook."
385,00:23:54.29,00:23:54.29,"As long as, you know, you feelthe same way we do, we're all"
386,00:23:57.08,00:23:57.08,in it together.>> Yeah.
387,00:23:58.58,00:23:58.58,>> And there's five of us.So it's... we can pick whoever
388,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,we want.We are in the majority.
389,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,"I think Bob responds reallywell to bold, confident moves."

394,00:24:12.92,00:24:12.92,That's it.And it doesn't really matter
395,00:24:14.79,00:24:14.79,'cause we're five.So lock it down.
396,00:24:17.58,00:24:17.58,That's it.>> Good point.
397,00:24:18.79,00:24:18.79,>> None of us are lookingto take Bob to the end.
398,00:24:21.00,00:24:21.00,"However, we need him fornumbers, and I think that we can"
399,00:24:23.58,00:24:23.58,trust him.>> Tree mail.

411,00:25:04.62,00:25:04.62,"We'll now bring in Sugar,returning from Exile Island."
412,00:25:07.21,00:25:07.21,">> Sugar.>> Hey, babe."

415,00:25:16.88,00:25:16.88,I didn't send you.It's the game.

420,00:25:32.25,00:25:32.25,"For today's challenge, one at atime, you will launch yourself"
421,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,down a slippery slide and intothe water.
422,00:25:39.25,00:25:39.25,You'll then swim out toretrieve a covered number tile
423,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,and race back.Once you've collected all six
424,00:25:45.21,00:25:45.21,"tiles, the remaining tribemember will use those numbered"
425,00:25:49.00,00:25:49.00,tiles to solve a math puzzle.The answer will reveal the
426,00:25:53.29,00:25:53.29,combination to a chest.First tribe to open their
427,00:25:57.29,00:25:57.29,chest and raise their tribeflag... wins immunity.

431,00:26:10.79,00:26:10.79,I'll also give you a minuteto strategize.
432,00:26:12.62,00:26:12.62,"We'll get started.All right, Bob and Ken are"
433,00:26:19.21,00:26:19.21,waiting to solve puzzle.Everybody else is going down
434,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,"the slide.For immunity, survivors ready?"
435,00:26:26.00,00:26:26.00,Go!It's Crystal and Kelly first
436,00:26:28.04,00:26:28.04,down.Kelly does it perfectly.
437,00:26:30.88,00:26:30.88,Crystal takes a hard hit.Both are in the water at the
438,00:26:35.92,00:26:35.92,same time.Crystal's tall enough she can
439,00:26:38.83,00:26:38.83,actually run to get her firstpuzzle piece.
440,00:26:41.83,00:26:41.83,">> Come on, Kelly!>> PROBST: Kelly coming back."

448,00:27:09.21,00:27:09.21,piece to this puzzle.Corinne quickly gets her number.
449,00:27:13.29,00:27:13.29,She's heading back.Making up a lot of time on
450,00:27:16.50,00:27:16.50,"Susie.>> Come on, Sue, faster!"

457,00:27:38.04,00:27:38.04,"Charlie out of the water,heading back for Kota."
458,00:27:41.04,00:27:41.04,"Kota has three tiles back.Fang, still with two."
459,00:27:45.83,00:27:45.83,Kota still with a good-sizedlead.
460,00:27:50.71,00:27:50.71,"Randy on the course for Fang.>> Come on, Randy!"

470,00:28:33.92,00:28:33.92,for Fang.Matty's going to have to make
471,00:28:36.88,00:28:36.88,up a lot of time.Marcus out of the water with
472,00:28:42.21,00:28:42.21,the sixth and final number forKota.
473,00:28:45.79,00:28:45.79,It's now up to Bob to solve thepuzzle.
474,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,">> Okay, Bob!You can do it!"

480,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,major to figure this out.You just need to be able to
481,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,concentrate.Read it carefully.
482,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,"Rearrange the numbers.""The sum of both end values will"

489,00:29:30.83,00:29:30.83,"open.No, he doesn't have it."
490,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,>> I think I got it.>> PROBST: Ken thinks he has it.
491,00:29:42.25,00:29:42.25,Ken tries it.He's not right.
492,00:29:44.04,00:29:44.04,Try to look at this puzzleagain.
493,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,Maybe you're putting a commawhere it doesn't belong or
494,00:29:48.88,00:29:48.88,"reading a word wrong.>> Oh, are these the end values?"
495,00:29:55.50,00:29:55.50,>> PROBST: Bob thinks he mighthave figured it out suddenly.

516,00:31:35.71,00:31:35.71,"like, a big desert.Saw a spot with this map"
517,00:31:39.12,00:31:39.12,and I kind of read it wrongor something.
518,00:31:41.92,00:31:41.92,I think I played off the factthat I won the idol pretty
519,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,well.I don't think anybody has
520,00:31:46.88,00:31:46.88,a clue that I got it.I'm not too bad at this.
521,00:31:50.71,00:31:50.71,"I'm a lot better than Ithought, for sure."
522,00:31:59.83,00:31:59.83,">> So I can hang on to thisthing for a while, maybe."
523,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,">> Yeah, hang on to it.I mean, I'd obviously, not"
524,00:32:04.12,00:32:04.12,"bring it to Tribal tonight,but I mean, I'd bring it to"
525,00:32:06.54,00:32:06.54,Tribal generally.>> I just had a very nice
526,00:32:17.08,00:32:17.08,"conversation in the canoe,being told that Sugar has the"
527,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,immunity idol.And we're going to hopefully
528,00:32:23.46,00:32:23.46,dominate this game.>> Paloma tonight.
529,00:32:27.12,00:32:27.12,">> Paloma's dead.>> Yeah, okay."
530,00:32:29.04,00:32:29.04,">> Um, Kelly's pretty dead afterthat."
531,00:32:31.00,00:32:31.00,>> Awesome.I'm pretty excited.
532,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,">> Now, we're all prepping forthe coupe de grace, being"
533,00:32:37.67,00:32:37.67,"Tribal Council, and thedismissal of little Miss Paloma."

535,00:32:59.88,00:32:59.88,"I just watch.Just watch, and then I'm going"
536,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,to pounce on someone and eatthem up.
537,00:33:08.75,00:33:08.75,Has Ace made an alliance withyou yet?
538,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,He's made an alliance witheverybody else.
539,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,>> He has?>> Mm-hmm.
540,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,>> He's not said one word to me.>> Mm-hmm.
541,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,He's not said one to me 'causehe doesn't like me.
542,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"I mean, he's trying everythinghe can to get rid of me, like"
543,00:33:20.04,00:33:20.04,putting me on the pole insteadof Sugar.
544,00:33:21.71,00:33:21.71,"Anyway, think about it.He doesn't want to get rid of"
545,00:33:23.79,00:33:23.79,"Sugar.Ace doesn't want to, and Ace"
546,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,is pretty much running the game.>> Hmm.
547,00:33:28.12,00:33:28.12,>> It's really crazy.Just keep your eyes out because
548,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,"he's really, really sneaky.Like, I'll just say what I need"
549,00:33:32.88,00:33:32.88,to say really fast till I getpeople to think and get their
550,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,"brains going and make them,like, all crazy and, like,"
551,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,"thinking.Ace might be, you know, strong"
552,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,"as an ox and I might be as weakas a mouse, but we're both"
553,00:33:44.79,00:33:44.79,50/50.People want him out because
554,00:33:46.46,00:33:46.46,he's strong.People might want me out because
555,00:33:48.46,00:33:48.46,"we're weak.>> He's not running the show,"
556,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"Paloma.>> Well, I mean, not..."
557,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,"I mean, personally, I don'treally care."
558,00:33:53.50,00:33:53.50,"I can't stand the guy.>> Well, let me see what I can"
559,00:33:54.88,00:33:54.88,think up.That's not happening.
560,00:33:56.79,00:33:56.79,I really can't stand Ace.I'm not sure that that accent is
561,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,real.I think he's a con artist. 
562,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,I would like it see him go homesooner rather than later.
563,00:34:04.71,00:34:04.71,I am afraid if Ace goes with usto the merge he will be the
564,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,first one to flip because he'son the outskirts of our
565,00:34:09.75,00:34:09.75,alliance.So I went on a walk with
566,00:34:11.38,00:34:11.38,Paloma.>> Yeah?
567,00:34:12.46,00:34:12.46,She tried me to be in analliance with her.
568,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,"And she was like, ""Ace is reallydangerous."""
