562,00:33:47.12,00:33:47.12,get Ozzy out of here.>> The plan that Tracy and I
563,00:33:50.75,00:33:50.75,"talked about is talk Amanda andCirie into voting for Erik,"
564,00:33:54.75,00:33:54.75,which they want to do anyway.Tell them that I'll vote with
565,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,them.Go for that.
566,00:33:58.96,00:33:58.96,We all three say we're votingfor Erik.
567,00:34:01.33,00:34:01.33,"Ozzy doesn't know, and doesn'twant to vote for Erik, so he'll"
568,00:34:03.79,00:34:03.79,"vote for Tracy, thinking we'reall going to vote for Tracy."
569,00:34:06.54,00:34:06.54,"Well, underneath all of that,Tracy, Erik, and I are going to"
570,00:34:10.92,00:34:10.92,"vote for Ozzy, and just takeOzzy out at the knees."
571,00:34:25.62,00:34:25.62,>> Mm-hmm.You're next after me.
572,00:34:27.29,00:34:27.29,If you think you are.>> In order to pull off voting
573,00:34:30.62,00:34:30.62,"out Ozzy at this point, we haveto either pull in Cirie and"
574,00:34:33.54,00:34:33.54,"Amanda.If this doesn't work out, I have"
575,00:34:36.04,00:34:36.04,"to vote Tracy.If I voted Ozzy with Tracy, they"
576,00:34:38.62,00:34:38.62,"would flip out, and I would beso done, whatever came next."
577,00:34:47.50,00:34:47.50,">> Well, I know Ozzy wants me.But I'd like to stay."
578,00:34:51.83,00:34:51.83,And you got to think right nowwhat you're going to do.
579,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,Would you rather go up againstme or would you rather go up
580,00:34:56.12,00:34:56.12,against Ozzy?Would you rather go up against
581,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,Erik or would you rather go upagainst me?
582,00:35:04.42,00:35:04.42,As long as you two say thatthat's good.
583,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,">> So you feel like Erik, right,because of..."
584,00:35:16.38,00:35:16.38,">> Well, yeah.Are you?"
585,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,Do you think that's the bestdecision?
586,00:35:21.29,00:35:21.29,>> I'm just nervous about whatOzzy might have planned on the
587,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,other side with Erik and thosegirls.
588,00:35:26.92,00:35:26.92,">> If I was definitely set onwanting Erik out tonight, he'd"
589,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,be gone tonight.I guarantee you.
590,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,But I don't know at this pointif I will be able to turn on
591,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,"Ozzy or not.If I go against Ozzy, then I can"
592,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,pretty much kiss thatrelationship good-bye.
593,00:35:39.96,00:35:39.96,"I mean, there are so many peoplethat you have to vote out."
594,00:35:42.54,00:35:42.54,You're going to hurt someone'sfeelings in this game.
595,00:35:45.88,00:35:45.88,It's inevitable.>> Don't look at me!
596,00:35:55.12,00:35:55.12,">> If Cirie and Amanda don'tvote with me, there's a whole"
597,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,other path that could be taken.I'm kind of going both ways in
598,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,"my head still.Am I going to take Ozzy out, or"
599,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,am I going to stick with thesepeople that I've known from the
600,00:36:06.33,00:36:06.33,beginning and vote out one ofthe fans?
601,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,Tonight's decision is a very bigdecision.
602,00:36:11.29,00:36:11.29,It could change the game in aserious way.
603,00:36:31.88,00:36:31.88,>> JEFF: Let's get straight toit.
604,00:36:33.54,00:36:33.54,This tribe is obviously introuble.
605,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,You've lost three straightimmunity challenges.
606,00:36:37.88,00:36:37.88,The only reason you're evenhalfway in it is because of odd
607,00:36:40.29,00:36:40.29,circumstances-- Penner having tobe medically pulled out of the
608,00:36:44.29,00:36:44.29,"game, and Kathy deciding toquit."
609,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,"Tracy, who is leading thistribe?"
610,00:36:49.25,00:36:49.25,>> Ozzy.Ozzy is leading this tribe.
611,00:36:52.25,00:36:52.25,"I mean, Ozzy was the first onethat looked at me and said, ""You"
612,00:36:54.71,00:36:54.71,"need to go to Exile Island forthe tribe."""
613,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,"Ozzy tells us who is going tocompete, when you're going to"
614,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"eat, and what you're going toeat."
615,00:37:02.29,00:37:02.29,">> JEFF: Ozzy, you had a bigreaction when Tracy said you're"
616,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"the leader.>> Oh, yeah, just... it's"
617,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,"ridiculous.If I'm the leader of this tribe,"
618,00:37:08.38,00:37:08.38,I haven't known about it.I do what needs to get done at
619,00:37:10.88,00:37:10.88,"certain times, but I reallydon't feel like I'm the leader"
620,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,of the tribe.And I definitely don't feel like
621,00:37:16.71,00:37:16.71,"I'm deciding who eats what when.That doesn't make any sense, and"
622,00:37:20.04,00:37:20.04,"doesn't jibe with me at all.>> JEFF: Cirie, somebody's got"
623,00:37:24.88,00:37:24.88,to be leading the tribe to onedegree or another.
624,00:37:27.62,00:37:27.62,>> In a way I kind of see whereTracy's coming from.
625,00:37:29.92,00:37:29.92,"I'm not saying that Ozzy is theleader of the tribe, but just"
626,00:37:33.79,00:37:33.79,"about 90% of everything that wedo, everyone checks with Ozzy"
627,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,"first.>> JEFF: Erik, do you see what"
628,00:37:40.17,00:37:40.17,"everybody's talking about, thedynamics right now?"
629,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> There's a conflict going on.There's a conflict in this
630,00:37:46.21,00:37:46.21,"tribe.And, I mean, I understand Ozzy's"
631,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,"point.Nobody wants to be the leader,"
632,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"but things need to get done.Things need to happen, and he's"
633,00:37:55.88,00:37:55.88,"doing so much for this tribe.If he was gone, we would fall"
634,00:37:57.67,00:37:57.67,apart faster than we are rightnow.
635,00:38:00.29,00:38:00.29,">> JEFF: Ami, there are twodifferent approaches this tribe"
636,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,"could take right now-- short-term thinking, which is, ""We"
637,00:38:05.92,00:38:05.92,"need to win challenges.""Long-term thinking is, ""I need"
638,00:38:09.12,00:38:09.12,"to start getting rid of peoplewho could beat me in this game."""
639,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"Take me down that line.>> Well, you always have to be"
640,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,"looking out for, ""Which one ofthese people is going to be the"
641,00:38:18.42,00:38:18.42,"biggest threat to me, and when'sthe best time to get rid of"
642,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"them?""And you've got to play your"
643,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,cards when it makes the mostsense.
644,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,">> JEFF: Ozzy, when you hear Amitalking about getting rid of the"
645,00:38:28.00,00:38:28.00,"people more threatening, makeyou a little concerned?"
646,00:38:31.79,00:38:31.79,">> Oh, yeah, it does.I'm not that naive to think that"
647,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,people don't want me gone evenif they need me to win
648,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,challenges.I'm still going to give it my
649,00:38:39.67,00:38:39.67,"all, and I'm still going to beloyal to the people that I've"
650,00:38:43.17,00:38:43.17,said I'm going to be loyal to.Nothing's going to change that.
651,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,"So if I'm a threat and peoplewant to get rid of me, you know,"
652,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,that's one strategy.But the other strategy is they
653,00:38:51.75,00:38:51.75,can be with me and we can tryand go to the end together.
654,00:38:54.79,00:38:54.79,">> JEFF: Tracy, why keep youtonight?"
655,00:38:58.21,00:38:58.21,>> I think I'd be a better tribemember than somebody's that's
656,00:39:01.12,00:39:01.12,going to demolish you if you dogo to the merge.
657,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,And I think that's that needs tobe a thought that all these
658,00:39:06.29,00:39:06.29,people need to think about.I would be less of a threat than
659,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,"Ozzy to Ami, to Amanda, toCirie, than Ozzy."
660,00:39:10.92,00:39:10.92,It's just as simple as that.It's black and white.
661,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,"There's no gray.>> JEFF: All right, let's get to"
662,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,it.It is time to vote.
663,00:39:20.71,00:39:20.71,"Amanda, you're up.>> You said you were honest, and"
664,00:39:37.12,00:39:37.12,that's bull.>> This is because you wanted me
665,00:39:51.38,00:39:51.38,out.Good player.
666,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,No hard feelings.>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
667,00:40:11.83,00:40:11.83,votes.If anybody has the hidden

669,00:40:25.12,00:40:25.12,so.Okay.
670,00:40:33.42,00:40:33.42,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
671,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
672,00:40:37.08,00:40:37.08,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
673,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,"First vote, Tracy.Ozzy."
674,00:40:48.33,00:40:48.33,"One vote Tracy, one vote Ozzy.Tracy."

680,00:41:33.29,00:41:33.29,"Time for you to go.Well, tonight's vote was big for"
681,00:41:45.67,00:41:45.67,one simple reason-- you've gotto start winning some
682,00:41:48.25,00:41:48.25,challenges.Hopefully you made the right
