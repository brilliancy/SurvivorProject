5,00:00:10.12,00:00:10.12,"sides. >> Oh, don't look so pissed off."
6,00:00:13.08,00:00:13.08,">> JEFF: After the switch, it became obvious how much the fans"
7,00:00:16.12,00:00:16.12,suffered. >> I'm amazed they're still
8,00:00:18.67,00:00:18.67,"alive, poor things. They should be dead."
9,00:00:20.92,00:00:20.92,>> JEFF: And how much the favorites thrived.
10,00:00:23.00,00:00:23.00,>> Those guys are tough as nails.
11,00:00:25.21,00:00:25.21,>> JEFF: The new Airai gelled immediately...
12,00:00:27.38,00:00:27.38,Airai wins! ...and went on a winning streak.
13,00:00:29.92,00:00:29.92,But they lost Jonathan due it an injury.
14,00:00:31.96,00:00:31.96,>> I couldn't have done anything else.
15,00:00:33.71,00:00:33.71,They did everything they could do.

17,00:00:45.17,00:00:45.17,"and replaced it with a fake one as a decoy, which was discovered"
18,00:00:49.75,00:00:49.75,by Jason. >> I guess this is the hidden
19,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,"immunity idol. >> Help me, help me, somebody."
20,00:00:57.71,00:00:57.71,">> JEFF: Cirie is losing it. >> Help me, help me!"
21,00:00:59.71,00:00:59.71,>> JEFF: Airai has it! When the new Malakal lost their

23,00:01:06.00,00:01:06.00,And at tribal council Erik received two throwaway votes...
24,00:01:10.08,00:01:10.08,>> I vowed never to vote for Chet.

28,00:01:18.12,00:01:18.12,"Erik, on Ozzy's tribe. 13 are left."
29,00:01:21.00,00:01:21.00,Who will be voted out tonight? >> A lot of crab.
30,00:01:32.21,00:01:32.21,>> Wow. >> I think we should have the
31,00:01:39.83,00:01:39.83,damn thing cut open right now. It's only laying two eggs
32,00:01:41.92,00:01:41.92,"anyway. >> Well, let's kill them right"
33,00:01:44.04,00:01:44.04,"now, all three of them. Oh, the chicken issue."
34,00:01:46.42,00:01:46.42,"Come on, girls. I think Tracy started it for"
35,00:01:49.04,00:01:49.04,some reason. I'm going to blame it on Tracy.
36,00:01:51.12,00:01:51.12,We've got three chickens that lay three eggs almost every
37,00:01:53.62,00:01:53.62,"single day. Hey, it's a renewable resource."
38,00:01:56.38,00:01:56.38,You want to take out a renewable resource?
39,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,"That makes no sense. >> Like, you're not going to"
40,00:02:01.17,00:02:01.17,kill them as soon as some more people get off so you can have
41,00:02:03.62,00:02:03.62,more meat for yourself? >> No.
42,00:02:06.92,00:02:06.92,No. Not going to happen.
43,00:02:09.25,00:02:09.25,>> Yeah. >> It doesn't matter.
44,00:02:10.96,00:02:10.96,It doesn't matter the way this game works.
45,00:02:12.58,00:02:12.58,">> It's three weeks, three chickens."
46,00:02:14.38,00:02:14.38,>> Tracy is breeding a lot of insecurity around camp.
47,00:02:17.12,00:02:17.12,"Of course, she's trying to play the game."
48,00:02:19.21,00:02:19.21,"She's trying to scramble to save her own ass, but we don't need"
49,00:02:21.25,00:02:21.25,that. Look at this-- crabs.
50,00:02:25.00,00:02:25.00,We've got massive crabs. There's plenty of other food.
51,00:02:27.92,00:02:27.92,"We just have to, like, get it. >> Ozzy is in control of this"
52,00:02:31.21,00:02:31.21,tribe. He's like the kingpin.
53,00:02:33.33,00:02:33.33,He tells you what you can and can't do.
54,00:02:35.46,00:02:35.46,He tells you when you're going to eat.
55,00:02:37.33,00:02:37.33,He cooks the food and then we have to wait until Ozzy says eat
56,00:02:39.25,00:02:39.25,it. It's crazy.
57,00:02:40.92,00:02:40.92,"I mean, it's just crazy. Ozzy is going to win this thing"
58,00:02:42.83,00:02:42.83,if we don't get him out of this game.

62,00:03:56.71,00:03:56.71,"I just want to get clean. Oh, yeah."
63,00:04:01.42,00:04:01.42,Another day in the lap of luxury.
64,00:04:05.33,00:04:05.33,"How do we do it, ladies? >> They complain about the rain."
65,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17,But they didn't get wet because we were in the cave.
66,00:04:14.17,00:04:14.17,"I mean, you could be like it was before-- outside, under a bush,"
67,00:04:17.54,00:04:17.54,getting pummeled by this rain. >> I bet nothing can capture the
68,00:04:21.54,00:04:21.54,true essence of the stench and this funk.
69,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,>> And how filthy we are right now.
70,00:04:29.29,00:04:29.29,>> Deal with the funk. It couldn't have smelled any
71,00:04:31.17,00:04:31.17,better than what they were in before.
72,00:04:32.58,00:04:32.58,Just relax. We're not going to be here
73,00:04:34.04,00:04:34.04,forever. This is a game called
74,00:04:35.79,00:04:35.79,called Survivor. >> I don't even see where
75,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,there's... >> A sign of hope?
76,00:04:40.46,00:04:40.46,>> No. >> Is my face just dirty?
77,00:04:44.62,00:04:44.62,>> This is just the stupidest thing I ever did in my life.
78,00:04:46.67,00:04:46.67,Probably because I'm just... I'm crabby.
79,00:04:49.46,00:04:49.46,"I'm not a morning person. >> Oh, baby."
80,00:04:52.42,00:04:52.42,">> The moods out here are you're on one day and feeling good, and"
81,00:04:57.21,00:04:57.21,"the next day it's just all crap. Today, this morning is a crap"
82,00:05:00.29,00:05:00.29,day. >> Could we just get a day of
83,00:05:03.17,00:05:03.17,"sunshine, please? Wash and dry our clothes."
84,00:05:07.25,00:05:07.25,">> Oh, my god. Thinking of home and my washer"
85,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,"and dryer and my food and my daughter and my husband, and..."
86,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,"Well, it's going to make me cry. It's going to make me want to be"
87,00:05:18.92,00:05:18.92,"there. Nope, still here."
88,00:05:22.58,00:05:22.58,Damn! >> Ozzy is amazing.
89,00:05:39.29,00:05:39.29,"I honestly like Ozzy. He's an awesome guy, and I want"
90,00:05:41.67,00:05:41.67,to learn. I want to grow.
91,00:05:43.83,00:05:43.83,I want to go outside the small scope that I've lived in and
92,00:05:46.71,00:05:46.71,just see a lot more of the world.
93,00:05:49.04,00:05:49.04,"And everybody thinks Ozzy is, look, the wonderkid, or"
94,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,"whatever. And I'm just like, ""I can do"
95,00:05:52.92,00:05:52.92,"that. I can climb a coconut tree,"
96,00:05:54.62,00:05:54.62,"too."" >> Some of them look like"
97,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,"they're stable, but then you'll pull it, and they'll just pull"
98,00:05:58.62,00:05:58.62,right off. When you grab the green palm
99,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,"frond, give it a little test. >> Erik and Ozzy are like The"
100,00:06:05.00,00:06:05.00,"Lion King, the father, when he was teaching the cub."
101,00:06:09.12,00:06:09.12,"And you can just see, like, stars."
102,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,"Whenever he says Ozzy's name, like, stardust comes out of his"
103,00:06:14.25,00:06:14.25,"mouth. Erik just is like, ""Ozzy..."""
104,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,>> A couple of more steps and you're there.
105,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,">> Wow. >> Cool, huh?"
106,00:06:23.58,00:06:23.58,"Good job, dude. >> They're bonding right now."
107,00:06:27.04,00:06:27.04,">> Oh, my god. >> Yes!"
108,00:06:32.21,00:06:32.21,>> You've got good nuts now. >> I think if Ozzy were to
109,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,"propose marriage to Erik right now, done deal."
110,00:06:42.83,00:06:42.83,>> I want to move the boat. >> Okay.
111,00:06:45.67,00:06:45.67,">> To the back beach. >> Oh, wow."
112,00:06:48.17,00:06:48.17,>> It makes way more sense to have it on that side.
113,00:06:50.83,00:06:50.83,It will be fast. >> They asked me to help move
114,00:06:53.79,00:06:53.79,"the boat to the back beach. We'd better be able to get back,"
115,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,"I know that, before it's sundown."
116,00:07:01.42,00:07:01.42,"Everybody knows, it's no secret, I'm not a strong swimmer, but"
117,00:07:06.21,00:07:06.21,"being a team player, you think you can get more fish on the"
118,00:07:08.79,00:07:08.79,"back beach, I'll help you row to the back beach."
119,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,"When we get way out in the middle of nowhere, and Ozzy"
120,00:07:19.83,00:07:19.83,"decides, ""well, the reef is right there, come on, we can get"
121,00:07:22.00,00:07:22.00,"really big fish at the reef,"" I'm nervous as hell."
122,00:07:24.79,00:07:24.79,I've never been out that far in the ocean in a little wooden
123,00:07:30.54,00:07:30.54,boat. >> I can see!
124,00:07:38.42,00:07:38.42,"I can see what you can see! Yeah, you."
125,00:07:46.17,00:07:46.17,>> Just trust me for a little bit.
126,00:07:48.71,00:07:48.71,There could be a giant clam out there that will feed us for the
127,00:07:50.71,00:07:50.71,rest of the time. Maybe there will be a pearl in
128,00:07:53.21,00:07:53.21,there I can give Cirie for paddling out here.
129,00:07:56.04,00:07:56.04,">> Ozzy is about numero uno, and that's Oscar."
130,00:08:05.04,00:08:05.04,"Yay, reef, reef. >> Cirie!"
131,00:08:10.21,00:08:10.21,"Oh, you're unhappy! >> So they'll have this little"
132,00:08:14.92,00:08:14.92,"reef adventure at my expense today, but it won't happen"
133,00:08:16.67,00:08:16.67,"again. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
134,00:08:29.83,00:08:29.83,Airai getting your first look at the new Malakal tribe.

137,00:08:39.92,00:08:39.92,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
138,00:08:41.38,00:08:41.38,>> JEFF: This is a traditional Micronesian money stone.
139,00:08:43.96,00:08:43.96,"For years, these stones were the currency in Micronesia."
140,00:08:46.96,00:08:46.96,"The larger the stone, the more value."
141,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,Today they're a part of your challenge.
142,00:08:51.04,00:08:51.04,"For today's challenge, four of you will be blindfolded."
143,00:08:53.50,00:08:53.50,The other two tribe members will use verbal direction to guide
144,00:08:57.12,00:08:57.12,you as you push a giant money stone through the jungle course.
145,00:09:01.04,00:09:01.04,"Along the way, you will crush the tiles at four stations"
146,00:09:05.25,00:09:05.25,revealing a pair of smaller money stones.
147,00:09:09.00,00:09:09.00,You'll then use those eight stones to solve a rotating cog
148,00:09:12.58,00:09:12.58,puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins
149,00:09:16.08,00:09:16.08,reward. Want to know what you're playing
150,00:09:18.12,00:09:18.12,for? >> Yeah.
151,00:09:19.92,00:09:19.92,>> JEFF: Close your eyes and imagine you're under a beautiful
152,00:09:21.96,00:09:21.96,refreshing waterfall. >> Oh!
153,00:09:25.17,00:09:25.17,">> Oh, god! >> JEFF: And you're cleaning"
154,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,"your body, and you're washing your hair."
155,00:09:29.17,00:09:29.17,">> Oh, you got to... >> That's your reward."

160,00:09:43.54,00:09:43.54,day. Worth playing for?
161,00:09:45.71,00:09:45.71,>> Yes. >> Absolutely.
162,00:09:47.58,00:09:47.58,">> JEFF: In addition, the winning tribe will send one"

166,00:09:57.17,00:09:57.17,member. Who is going to sit this one
167,00:09:58.88,00:09:58.88,out? >> I am.
168,00:10:00.54,00:10:00.54,">> JEFF: All right, Natalie, take a spot over here."

174,00:10:17.38,00:10:17.38,"Keep coming. >> Okay, follow my voice, follow"
175,00:10:19.12,00:10:19.12,my voice. Keep coming straight.
176,00:10:20.54,00:10:20.54,"Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming."
177,00:10:22.08,00:10:22.08,">> Come on, straight, straight. Pivot to your left, to your"
178,00:10:24.67,00:10:24.67,left. The other way!

180,00:10:30.12,00:10:30.12,"Right, right, right. >> Okay, stop!"
181,00:10:33.08,00:10:33.08,Come across! >> JEFF: Malakal is through

183,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17,"Okay, you're at the thing. You feel it?"
184,00:10:39.83,00:10:39.83,You've got to pivot left a little.
185,00:10:41.50,00:10:41.50,"Okay, straight. Keep going!"
186,00:10:43.12,00:10:43.12,Keep going. Straight.
187,00:10:44.38,00:10:44.38,There you go. You broke the stone.

264,00:14:34.50,00:14:34.50,It made me feel proud that we were able to win and bring him
265,00:14:38.58,00:14:38.58,in and let him experience this. >> That was nice.
266,00:14:42.21,00:14:42.21,>> Yeah. >> What is that?
267,00:14:45.25,00:14:45.25,I think that's our shower right there.
268,00:14:47.71,00:14:47.71,>> Yeah. >> You want to go shower?

275,00:15:16.25,00:15:16.25,"I don't know. I just looked over and there's,"
276,00:15:18.62,00:15:18.62,"like, a couple of pair of boobs, and Ozzy's head smack dab in the"
277,00:15:20.88,00:15:20.88,"middle. I'm like, ""Okay."""
278,00:15:23.62,00:15:23.62,The only thing funnier was Erik drooling from the sight.
279,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,"( laughs ) Hey, to each his own."
280,00:15:33.42,00:15:33.42,"If you feel free like that, then by all means, get free."
281,00:15:39.46,00:15:39.46,"I just wouldn't do it. >> Oh, oh, man."
282,00:15:45.33,00:15:45.33,This is as perfect as I could have ever hoped for.
283,00:15:56.25,00:15:56.25,>> This came on so fast. >> It's a freaking mon-freaking-
284,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,soon. >> It just came out of nowhere.
285,00:16:05.54,00:16:05.54,">> It's completely different. You watch this show at home, and"
286,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,"when they show the rain, they show it for, like, 30 seconds."
287,00:16:13.33,00:16:13.33,They're not showing that you're standing in the rain or trying
288,00:16:16.71,00:16:16.71,"to sleep while you're being rained on for five, six hours"
289,00:16:20.04,00:16:20.04,"straight, non-stop. We had to stand out there, and"
290,00:16:38.38,00:16:38.38,"James went out in the rain and caught a clam, and we had to sit"
291,00:16:41.17,00:16:41.17,"around and eat a raw clam, because there's no fire, and"
292,00:16:43.67,00:16:43.67,you're all just digging in it with your hands like you're
293,00:16:45.50,00:16:45.50,animals. >> You guys okay if I put a
294,00:16:48.12,00:16:48.12,little on my lemon? >> You people are disgusting.
295,00:16:51.17,00:16:51.17,I was just talking about how I think...
296,00:16:53.38,00:16:53.38,">> And it's full of sand, and it's full of dirt."
297,00:16:56.00,00:16:56.00,"And the coconut you're cleaning falls on the ground, but you"
298,00:16:58.42,00:16:58.42,"don't care. You just put it back in, because"
299,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,it's food. And it's just savagery.
300,00:17:03.46,00:17:03.46,"It's like you're cavemen, you know?"
301,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,Never in a million years would I ever do this twice.
302,00:17:17.12,00:17:17.12,">> Is it scary in there? >> It just rained, and it"
303,00:17:22.04,00:17:22.04,"rained, and we crawled way down into the cave."
304,00:17:25.21,00:17:25.21,And it's miserable. And it's awful.
305,00:17:27.62,00:17:27.62,And it's dirty. And you don't even know what's
306,00:17:31.79,00:17:31.79,dead and crawling. Son of a bitch!
307,00:17:34.54,00:17:34.54,We sleep in the caves with bats and rats and crawly things.
308,00:17:38.75,00:17:38.75,>> Ow! >> It's hard to explain that
309,00:17:42.96,00:17:42.96,"experience, that it's just... it's just so uncomfortable."
310,00:17:46.21,00:17:46.21,It's so unpleasant. And I said it myself the other
311,00:17:48.71,00:17:48.71,"day, ""This is the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life."
312,00:17:50.67,00:17:50.67,"This is the dumbest thing I've ever done."""
313,00:18:11.08,00:18:11.08,"Well, when I woke up this morning, I hadn't gotten any"
314,00:18:14.21,00:18:14.21,"sleep. Again, we were in the cave."
315,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,It rained all night. And I was looking for some kind
316,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,"of strength, and I couldn't find it."
317,00:18:23.71,00:18:23.71,"I was thinking of putting some wood on the beach, but I don't"
318,00:18:25.83,00:18:25.83,know how high the tide will come in.
319,00:18:27.88,00:18:27.88,"Can I have one more hug, one more?"
320,00:18:29.54,00:18:29.54,I need one more hug to get me through the day.
321,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,"I'm just so out of it, James. >> It's okay."
322,00:18:35.62,00:18:35.62,"Everybody has their days. >> You know, I was trying to"
323,00:18:43.54,00:18:43.54,"send... it sounds so stupid. I was trying to send, like,"
324,00:18:47.04,00:18:47.04,"vibes to my daughter, Maddie. You know, ""Can you hear me?"
325,00:18:50.25,00:18:50.25,You can feel me? I need your help.
326,00:18:53.00,00:18:53.00,I need your help to help me through this because I can't do

330,00:19:15.12,00:19:15.12,"can't take another minute, I can't."
331,00:19:18.88,00:19:18.88,"I can't. I know it's sunny, it's"
332,00:19:21.67,00:19:21.67,"beautiful, it's like, ""Ooh,"" But I can't."
333,00:19:24.12,00:19:24.12,I can't be here one more minute. I can't take it.
334,00:19:26.62,00:19:26.62,And I just want you guys to be okay and not hate me for it.
335,00:19:28.75,00:19:28.75,"I just can't take it one more minute, I can't."
336,00:19:36.12,00:19:36.12,>> You have to be 100% sure. >> I'm 100% sure.
337,00:19:38.75,00:19:38.75,I can't. I can't do it anymore.

352,00:20:19.42,00:20:19.42,"and built up one upon another, and she's just severely"

356,00:20:31.25,00:20:31.25,"Like, she's done. She's quitting the game."

379,00:21:59.08,00:21:59.08,don't want to let anybody down. I don't want anybody to hate me.
380,00:22:01.67,00:22:01.67,I don't want anybody to think that I'm quitting.
381,00:22:09.21,00:22:09.21,>> JEFF: This adventure means different things to different
382,00:22:12.75,00:22:12.75,people. It represents different things
383,00:22:14.71,00:22:14.71,to different people. You've certainly given it your
384,00:22:16.96,00:22:16.96,best. >> Yeah.
385,00:22:19.29,00:22:19.29,"Oh, god. >> JEFF: And all's going to be"
386,00:22:22.29,00:22:22.29,okay. Ready to get out of here?
387,00:22:25.25,00:22:25.25,>> I am. >> JEFF: Let's get your stuff.
388,00:22:40.46,00:22:40.46,">> I'm sorry, guys. >> Don't apologize."
389,00:22:42.96,00:22:42.96,">> I'm sorry. >> You know, Kathy's been"
390,00:22:48.67,00:22:48.67,"through a lot, and most of it is she lost most of her motivation."
391,00:22:50.62,00:22:50.62,So what's the point of going through the suffering?
392,00:22:52.67,00:22:52.67,>> It was nice to get to know you these last couple of days.
393,00:22:54.88,00:22:54.88,">> She just said she's had enough, and she's quitting."
394,00:22:57.21,00:22:57.21,"Which is sad, but still and all, I mean, it's up to her."
395,00:23:00.46,00:23:00.46,You can't fault her. You can't be upset with her.
396,00:23:04.96,00:23:04.96,"Hope she has a good trip, and I'm sure I'll see her again."
397,00:23:07.88,00:23:07.88,>> JEFF: So the Airai tribe is down to six in spite of winning
398,00:23:14.17,00:23:14.17,challenges. Game continues.
399,00:23:17.92,00:23:17.92,See you soon. >> Bye.
400,00:23:27.71,00:23:27.71,">> Bye. >> Kathy leaving, it's sad, but"
401,00:23:49.54,00:23:49.54,"at the same time, life goes on here, and there's a reality to"
402,00:23:52.62,00:23:52.62,"the fact that the sun is going down, and we haven't had water"
403,00:23:55.04,00:23:55.04,"in three days, and we haven't had a cooked meal because we"
404,00:23:57.46,00:23:57.46,"haven't had fire. You know, so Survivor continues"
405,00:24:00.54,00:24:00.54,for the rest of us. >> I think you got a dose of who
406,00:24:19.12,00:24:19.12,Oscar really is with the boat ride yesterday.
407,00:24:24.21,00:24:24.21,And... >> I'm starting to see that.
408,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,>> Mm-hmm. >> He's kind of arrogant.
409,00:24:28.88,00:24:28.88,>> You think? >> Kind of bothering me.
410,00:24:31.29,00:24:31.29,>> Hmm. Amanda got to see how there's a
411,00:24:35.25,00:24:35.25,"selfish, arrogant part to Ozzy. >> It's so sad."
412,00:24:39.79,00:24:39.79,Very sad. >> And if I got that out of the
413,00:24:45.62,00:24:45.62,"trip, then, okay, I can suck it up, because there was a benefit"
414,00:24:49.00,00:24:49.00,"to it-- letting her see, you know, Ozzy is about Ozzy."
415,00:24:53.08,00:24:53.08,">> I don't know. Like, I've been trying to figure"
416,00:24:54.96,00:24:54.96,"out if people really think Ozzy is, like, the best thing in the"
417,00:24:56.96,00:24:56.96,world or if they're just playing.
418,00:24:58.88,00:24:58.88,">> Did you hear Erik? ""Oh, my god, if he wasn't here"
419,00:25:01.04,00:25:01.04,"we'd die."" It's like, ""Shut up, Erik."""
420,00:25:04.54,00:25:04.54,"How can we vote Erik, though? How many of us is it?"
421,00:25:08.58,00:25:08.58,Because Ozzy is not going to vote Erik.
422,00:25:11.92,00:25:11.92,He's kind of in love with Erik right now.
423,00:25:14.21,00:25:14.21,They climbed that coconut tree. And because he just worships the
424,00:25:18.42,00:25:18.42,"ground that he walks on, he'll never get rid of Erik."
425,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,>> I think it's the best move to make.
426,00:25:23.83,00:25:23.83,>> To get rid of Erik? >> Maybe.
427,00:25:27.21,00:25:27.21,>> Ozzy's not going to do it. >> We just have to let him think
428,00:25:31.25,00:25:31.25,he's in complete control. >> Mm-hmm.
429,00:25:33.54,00:25:33.54,>> You know what I'm saying? >> Mm-hmm.
430,00:25:40.04,00:25:40.04,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys. Malakal, getting your first look"
431,00:25:49.75,00:25:49.75,at the new Airai tribe. Kathy has left the game.
432,00:25:53.38,00:25:53.38,>> Kathy? >> What?
433,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,>> JEFF: We'll bring Jason and Tracy in from Exile.
434,00:25:59.25,00:25:59.25,"I'll explain what happened. >> Well, hello!"
435,00:26:04.17,00:26:04.17,>> Hi. >> Hey.
436,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,>> JEFF: Let me kitchen everybody up on what's going on.
437,00:26:09.50,00:26:09.50,"Yesterday, Kathy sent word that she wanted out of the game."
438,00:26:13.04,00:26:13.04,"I went over to Airai's camp. She said, ""I've had enough."
439,00:26:15.42,00:26:15.42,"I need to go."" We packed up her belongings."
440,00:26:18.21,00:26:18.21,She quit. Both tribes at six.
441,00:26:20.79,00:26:20.79,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?"
442,00:26:23.38,00:26:23.38,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: First things first.
443,00:26:25.08,00:26:25.08,"Give it up, Eliza. Once again, immunity is back up"
444,00:26:33.75,00:26:33.75,"for grabs. On my go, one member of each"
445,00:26:36.00,00:26:36.00,tribe will race across a floating bridge carrying one end
446,00:26:39.54,00:26:39.54,"of a piece of rope. When you reach the platform,"
447,00:26:42.83,00:26:42.83,"you'll clip the rope into a large puzzle piece, and then"
448,00:26:45.46,00:26:45.46,"hang on as the rest of the tribe will crank a giant winch,"
449,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,pulling you and the puzzle piece back to shore.
450,00:26:52.29,00:26:52.29,"Once you've collected all five puzzle pieces, two tribe members"
451,00:26:55.62,00:26:55.62,will unfold those bundles and use the pieces to solve a puzzle
452,00:26:59.04,00:26:59.04,in the form of a perfect square. Make sense?
453,00:27:02.62,00:27:02.62,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.

455,00:27:06.12,00:27:06.12,started. Eliza and Ozzy first off.

555,00:33:21.83,00:33:21.83,Could I betray him if it comes down to that?
556,00:33:24.25,00:33:24.25,Sometimes you have to pull the dirty cards to stay in the game.
557,00:33:27.79,00:33:27.79,Let me tell you what's happening.

559,00:33:31.71,00:33:31.71,Ozzy wants to get rid of you. It was his idea to send you to
560,00:33:34.54,00:33:34.54,Exile. >> I know.
561,00:33:36.50,00:33:36.50,>> And so if we can get Ozzy to vote for you and us three girls
562,00:33:41.42,00:33:41.42,"to vote for, Erik, then you, me, and Erik can vote for Ozzy and"
563,00:33:47.12,00:33:47.12,get Ozzy out of here. >> The plan that Tracy and I
564,00:33:50.75,00:33:50.75,"talked about is talk Amanda and Cirie into voting for Erik,"
565,00:33:54.75,00:33:54.75,which they want to do anyway. Tell them that I'll vote with
566,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,them. Go for that.
567,00:33:58.96,00:33:58.96,We all three say we're voting for Erik.
568,00:34:01.33,00:34:01.33,"Ozzy doesn't know, and doesn't want to vote for Erik, so he'll"
569,00:34:03.79,00:34:03.79,"vote for Tracy, thinking we're all going to vote for Tracy."
570,00:34:06.54,00:34:06.54,"Well, underneath all of that, Tracy, Erik, and I are going to"
571,00:34:10.92,00:34:10.92,"vote for Ozzy, and just take Ozzy out at the knees."
572,00:34:25.62,00:34:25.62,>> Mm-hmm. You're next after me.
573,00:34:27.29,00:34:27.29,If you think you are. >> In order to pull off voting
574,00:34:30.62,00:34:30.62,"out Ozzy at this point, we have to either pull in Cirie and"
575,00:34:33.54,00:34:33.54,"Amanda. If this doesn't work out, I have"
576,00:34:36.04,00:34:36.04,"to vote Tracy. If I voted Ozzy with Tracy, they"
577,00:34:38.62,00:34:38.62,"would flip out, and I would be so done, whatever came next."
578,00:34:47.50,00:34:47.50,">> Well, I know Ozzy wants me. But I'd like to stay."
579,00:34:51.83,00:34:51.83,And you got to think right now what you're going to do.
580,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,Would you rather go up against me or would you rather go up
581,00:34:56.12,00:34:56.12,against Ozzy? Would you rather go up against
582,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,Erik or would you rather go up against me?
583,00:35:04.42,00:35:04.42,As long as you two say that that's good.
584,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,">> So you feel like Erik, right, because of..."
585,00:35:16.38,00:35:16.38,">> Well, yeah. Are you?"
586,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,Do you think that's the best decision?
587,00:35:21.29,00:35:21.29,>> I'm just nervous about what Ozzy might have planned on the
588,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,other side with Erik and those girls.
589,00:35:26.92,00:35:26.92,">> If I was definitely set on wanting Erik out tonight, he'd"
590,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,be gone tonight. I guarantee you.
591,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,But I don't know at this point if I will be able to turn on
592,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,"Ozzy or not. If I go against Ozzy, then I can"
593,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,pretty much kiss that relationship good-bye.
594,00:35:39.96,00:35:39.96,"I mean, there are so many people that you have to vote out."
595,00:35:42.54,00:35:42.54,You're going to hurt someone's feelings in this game.
596,00:35:45.88,00:35:45.88,It's inevitable. >> Don't look at me!
597,00:35:55.12,00:35:55.12,">> If Cirie and Amanda don't vote with me, there's a whole"
598,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,other path that could be taken. I'm kind of going both ways in
599,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,"my head still. Am I going to take Ozzy out, or"
600,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,am I going to stick with these people that I've known from the
601,00:36:06.33,00:36:06.33,beginning and vote out one of the fans?
602,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,Tonight's decision is a very big decision.
603,00:36:11.29,00:36:11.29,It could change the game in a serious way.
604,00:36:31.88,00:36:31.88,>> JEFF: Let's get straight to it.
605,00:36:33.54,00:36:33.54,This tribe is obviously in trouble.
606,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,You've lost three straight immunity challenges.
607,00:36:37.88,00:36:37.88,The only reason you're even halfway in it is because of odd
608,00:36:40.29,00:36:40.29,circumstances-- Penner having to be medically pulled out of the
609,00:36:44.29,00:36:44.29,"game, and Kathy deciding to quit."
610,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,"Tracy, who is leading this tribe?"
611,00:36:49.25,00:36:49.25,>> Ozzy. Ozzy is leading this tribe.
612,00:36:52.25,00:36:52.25,"I mean, Ozzy was the first one that looked at me and said, ""You"
613,00:36:54.71,00:36:54.71,"need to go to Exile Island for the tribe."""
614,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,"Ozzy tells us who is going to compete, when you're going to"
615,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"eat, and what you're going to eat."
616,00:37:02.29,00:37:02.29,">> JEFF: Ozzy, you had a big reaction when Tracy said you're"
617,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"the leader. >> Oh, yeah, just... it's"
618,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,"ridiculous. If I'm the leader of this tribe,"
619,00:37:08.38,00:37:08.38,I haven't known about it. I do what needs to get done at
620,00:37:10.88,00:37:10.88,"certain times, but I really don't feel like I'm the leader"
621,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,of the tribe. And I definitely don't feel like
622,00:37:16.71,00:37:16.71,"I'm deciding who eats what when. That doesn't make any sense, and"
623,00:37:20.04,00:37:20.04,"doesn't jibe with me at all. >> JEFF: Cirie, somebody's got"
624,00:37:24.88,00:37:24.88,to be leading the tribe to one degree or another.
625,00:37:27.62,00:37:27.62,>> In a way I kind of see where Tracy's coming from.
626,00:37:29.92,00:37:29.92,"I'm not saying that Ozzy is the leader of the tribe, but just"
627,00:37:33.79,00:37:33.79,"about 90% of everything that we do, everyone checks with Ozzy"
628,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,"first. >> JEFF: Erik, do you see what"
629,00:37:40.17,00:37:40.17,"everybody's talking about, the dynamics right now?"
630,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> There's a conflict going on. There's a conflict in this
631,00:37:46.21,00:37:46.21,"tribe. And, I mean, I understand Ozzy's"
632,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,"point. Nobody wants to be the leader,"
633,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"but things need to get done. Things need to happen, and he's"
634,00:37:55.88,00:37:55.88,"doing so much for this tribe. If he was gone, we would fall"
635,00:37:57.67,00:37:57.67,apart faster than we are right now.
636,00:38:00.29,00:38:00.29,">> JEFF: Ami, there are two different approaches this tribe"
637,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,"could take right now-- short- term thinking, which is, ""We"
638,00:38:05.92,00:38:05.92,"need to win challenges."" Long-term thinking is, ""I need"
639,00:38:09.12,00:38:09.12,"to start getting rid of people who could beat me in this game."""
640,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"Take me down that line. >> Well, you always have to be"
641,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,"looking out for, ""Which one of these people is going to be the"
642,00:38:18.42,00:38:18.42,"biggest threat to me, and when's the best time to get rid of"
643,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"them?"" And you've got to play your"
644,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,cards when it makes the most sense.
645,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,">> JEFF: Ozzy, when you hear Ami talking about getting rid of the"
646,00:38:28.00,00:38:28.00,"people more threatening, make you a little concerned?"
647,00:38:31.79,00:38:31.79,">> Oh, yeah, it does. I'm not that naive to think that"
648,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,people don't want me gone even if they need me to win
649,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,challenges. I'm still going to give it my
650,00:38:39.67,00:38:39.67,"all, and I'm still going to be loyal to the people that I've"
651,00:38:43.17,00:38:43.17,said I'm going to be loyal to. Nothing's going to change that.
652,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,"So if I'm a threat and people want to get rid of me, you know,"
653,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,that's one strategy. But the other strategy is they
654,00:38:51.75,00:38:51.75,can be with me and we can try and go to the end together.
655,00:38:54.79,00:38:54.79,">> JEFF: Tracy, why keep you tonight?"
656,00:38:58.21,00:38:58.21,>> I think I'd be a better tribe member than somebody's that's
657,00:39:01.12,00:39:01.12,going to demolish you if you do go to the merge.
658,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,And I think that's that needs to be a thought that all these
659,00:39:06.29,00:39:06.29,people need to think about. I would be less of a threat than
660,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,"Ozzy to Ami, to Amanda, to Cirie, than Ozzy."
661,00:39:10.92,00:39:10.92,It's just as simple as that. It's black and white.
662,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,"There's no gray. >> JEFF: All right, let's get to"
663,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,it. It is time to vote.
664,00:39:20.71,00:39:20.71,"Amanda, you're up. >> You said you were honest, and"
665,00:39:37.12,00:39:37.12,that's bull. >> This is because you wanted me
666,00:39:51.38,00:39:51.38,out. Good player.
667,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,No hard feelings. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the
668,00:40:11.83,00:40:11.83,votes. If anybody has the hidden
669,00:40:23.08,00:40:23.08,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now wouldn't time to do"
670,00:40:25.12,00:40:25.12,so. Okay.
671,00:40:33.42,00:40:33.42,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
672,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
673,00:40:37.08,00:40:37.08,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
674,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,"First vote, Tracy. Ozzy."
675,00:40:48.33,00:40:48.33,"One vote Tracy, one vote Ozzy. Tracy."
676,00:40:57.38,00:40:57.38,"Two votes Tracy, one vote Ozzy. Tracy."
677,00:41:04.96,00:41:04.96,"That's three votes Tracy, one vote Ozzy."
678,00:41:11.71,00:41:11.71,Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Fans Versus
679,00:41:14.04,00:41:14.04,"Favorites, Tracy. That's four, that's enough."
680,00:41:17.12,00:41:17.12,"You need to bring me your torch. Tracy, the tribe has spoken."
681,00:41:33.29,00:41:33.29,"Time for you to go. Well, tonight's vote was big for"
682,00:41:45.67,00:41:45.67,one simple reason-- you've got to start winning some
683,00:41:48.25,00:41:48.25,challenges. Hopefully you made the right
684,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,choice. Grab your torches.
685,00:41:52.00,00:41:52.00,Head back to camp. Good night.

694,00:42:28.17,00:42:28.17,Erik takes a hard hit. He's out!
695,00:42:37.54,00:42:37.54,>> Going up against the favorites was quite difficult.
696,00:42:39.96,00:42:39.96,Ozzy's a wonderful player in this game.
697,00:42:42.08,00:42:42.08,He is manipulative and he is strategic.
698,00:42:45.71,00:42:45.71,He will definitely take the rest of the tribe down.
699,00:42:48.08,00:42:48.08,They need to get rid of him ASAP or else they don't stand a
700,00:42:50.42,00:42:50.42,chance. I wish I could have stayed in
701,00:42:52.21,00:42:52.21,longer. I went out kicking.
