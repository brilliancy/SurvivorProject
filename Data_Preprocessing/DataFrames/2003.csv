58,00:03:31.12,00:03:31.12,and buy me some extra time if Ineed it.
59,00:03:43.29,00:03:43.29,>> Right.It's hard to play nice after a

73,00:04:36.75,00:04:36.75,">> Does your head stay on hischest, or does it roll off?"
74,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,(laughter)Mine just rolls right off.
75,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,It won't stay.Ew!
76,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,(laughter)Stop it!

80,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,"different things around camp.I mean, the clearest sign..."
81,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"For anybody that's going to playSurvivor in the future, I'm"
82,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,going to give you the key tofiguring out who's on what team.
83,00:05:17.83,00:05:17.83,Watch how they sleep at night.Whoever's sleeping next to who--
84,00:05:21.21,00:05:21.21,and I'm even guilty of it-- willtell you who's aligned with who.
85,00:05:25.33,00:05:25.33,"Because at night when you go tosleep, you don't usually go to"
86,00:05:28.33,00:05:28.33,sleep next to the guy who youwant to vote off.
87,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,>> All right.Sorry.
88,00:05:34.00,00:05:34.00,>> It's okay.>> I don't trust Russell's ass

91,00:05:44.79,00:05:44.79,since the minute we landed here.He won't do anything without
92,00:05:47.21,00:05:47.21,her.He has to sleep next to her
93,00:05:49.54,00:05:49.54,every night.Coach and Jerri are trying to do
94,00:05:52.58,00:05:52.58,the same thing.That can be dangerous.
95,00:05:55.17,00:05:55.17,I know. I've been there.And I know how powerful that
96,00:05:59.12,00:05:59.12,kind of an alliance is.>> Our tribe has not been solid
97,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,since we've been together.That's why I was kind of hoping
98,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"for a rainy day that would forceus all in the shelter, all day"
99,00:06:26.04,00:06:26.04,"today, and play games and talkand do some bonding stuff and do"
100,00:06:29.21,00:06:29.21,"some empowerment stuff.>> This is the coop, huh? Sweet!"
101,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,">> If we don't become a good,cohesive team, we will continue"
102,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,to lose.>> Get them inside.
103,00:06:40.88,00:06:40.88,(clucking)>> They got out.
104,00:06:47.58,00:06:47.58,">> Hell, yeah!Free chickies!"

106,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,">> Get him out of there.>> Oh, they're right there,"
107,00:06:58.46,00:06:58.46,y'all.Let's just grab them.
108,00:07:00.54,00:07:00.54,">> Grab 'em, bro.(loud clucking)"
109,00:07:02.54,00:07:02.54,">> Okay, there's one of them.>> Hold him."
110,00:07:06.08,00:07:06.08,>> I don't even see the otherone.
111,00:07:11.50,00:07:11.50,">> Oh, there he is.>> There he is! There he is!"
112,00:07:13.50,00:07:13.50,There he is!>> Grab him!
113,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,>> Hang on. Don't...Don't get him running.
114,00:07:17.50,00:07:17.50,"Don't get him running.>> He is now wanted, dead or"
115,00:07:19.83,00:07:19.83,"alive, so it's his choice.>> He just went out that way,"
116,00:07:22.58,00:07:22.58,"that way, that way.What?"
117,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,>> There he goes.He's under the shelter.
118,00:07:28.12,00:07:28.12,>> Surround the shelter andlet's do the same thing.
119,00:07:30.46,00:07:30.46,>> He's coming out the back.>> That's good. Yeah.
120,00:07:33.25,00:07:33.25,">> Good.>> Good, good, good, Tom, very,"

125,00:07:53.50,00:07:53.50,">> So in that sense, thechickens getting out was"
126,00:07:55.12,00:07:55.12,supposed to happen to help usbond.
127,00:08:00.67,00:08:00.67,(Rupert snorts)>> They're not going to kill
128,00:08:06.12,00:08:06.12,that thing so fast.>> I can't believe that thing is
129,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,"just sitting there, dude.>> So, what's up, man?"
130,00:08:12.92,00:08:12.92,>> The first vote is the mostimportant vote.
131,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,>> Right.>> You got to be careful.
132,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,That's what I wanted to talk toyou about.
133,00:08:19.79,00:08:19.79,"You got to be careful, 'causepeople want to have any excuse"
134,00:08:21.83,00:08:21.83,to not be the vote.What is that excuse?
135,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,"""Oh, Russell and Parvati aretogether."""
136,00:08:25.79,00:08:25.79,>> Right.>> Whatever it is...
137,00:08:27.79,00:08:27.79,>> Right.>> Everybody's going to use an
138,00:08:29.83,00:08:29.83,"excuse so it's not them.Russell, um, is walking on very"
139,00:08:32.25,00:08:32.25,"thin ice.Parvati, in my opinion, is the"
140,00:08:34.92,00:08:34.92,most dangerous player on ourtribe.
141,00:08:38.04,00:08:38.04,>> And it's not that we're coolor nothing-- me and Parvati.
142,00:08:41.21,00:08:41.21,"It's because, uh, she's a goodasset to the team."
143,00:08:44.21,00:08:44.21,>> For him to be followingaround Parvati is no strategy
144,00:08:47.58,00:08:47.58,at all.It's puppy love.
145,00:08:50.46,00:08:50.46,She's got the charm.She's got the smile.
146,00:08:52.83,00:08:52.83,"For some reason, when she paysattention to you, you feel like"
147,00:08:55.21,00:08:55.21,you light up.It's not that people don't see
148,00:08:57.62,00:08:57.62,it.It's just that they are allured
149,00:08:59.96,00:08:59.96,"by her charm, and they're takenby it."
150,00:09:02.25,00:09:02.25,They're smitten by it.It's unbelievable.
151,00:09:09.12,00:09:09.12,>> What's the deal?>> Uh...
152,00:09:13.08,00:09:13.08,>> About what?>> Who can kind of...
153,00:09:15.08,00:09:15.08,">> Uh, ultimately, I'm tryingto get a feel on Russell on what"

161,00:09:34.83,00:09:34.83,"around with her, so...>> Yeah."
162,00:09:36.71,00:09:36.71,>> ...you have to understandour concern.

164,00:09:40.54,00:09:40.54,">> Yeah, you're totally right,and it's like it's ostracizing"

168,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,>> You've got to do it.I have no choice.
169,00:09:52.21,00:09:52.21,That would be my... the end ofmy game...
170,00:09:54.21,00:09:54.21,"Everybody knows Coach is a bigjoke, so he can go around"
171,00:09:58.62,00:09:58.62,flapping his jaws all he wants.The thing with Rob-- he thinks
172,00:10:02.17,00:10:02.17,"he's the boss of the camp, likethat's my daddy."
173,00:10:04.79,00:10:04.79,"Well, I'm the daddy around here.But I got to listen to this fool"
174,00:10:09.58,00:10:09.58,like he's in control.But that's what I have to do to
175,00:10:12.21,00:10:12.21,get to the top.That's what I'm going to have
176,00:10:14.38,00:10:14.38,to do until he's gone.He don't know who he's messing
177,00:10:16.33,00:10:16.33,with.Nobody knows who they're
178,00:10:18.38,00:10:18.38,messing with around here.It's Russell Hantz.
179,00:10:20.62,00:10:20.62,"Give me a break!>> And he's, like, ""No, no."

184,00:10:46.04,00:10:46.04,>> He is demented.>> I didn't want your name to
185,00:10:48.17,00:10:48.17,"even be on the block.It worries me because of that,"
186,00:10:50.08,00:10:50.08,so I was... I was even trying toconvince him...
187,00:10:52.25,00:10:52.25,">> I'm used to it, honestly.>> I was even trying to convince"

575,00:31:46.83,00:31:46.83,I think everyone has their ownstrength...
576,00:31:48.83,00:31:48.83,">> Yeah, but if we vote him outtonight, they'll have to sit out"
577,00:31:50.83,00:31:50.83,"one of their strong guys in thenext challenge, so that will"

584,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,I'm just trying to figure outwhat's going on.
585,00:32:11.29,00:32:11.29,">> Well, but if you're trying toget someone to vote for someone,"
586,00:32:13.54,00:32:13.54,you have to say who.>> I'm not trying to get anybody

588,00:32:17.75,00:32:17.75,honestly.Moments like that drive me up
589,00:32:19.75,00:32:19.75,the wall.That girl-- she thinks that she

603,00:33:00.83,00:33:00.83,"If you guys don't see that,you're next."
604,00:33:05.33,00:33:05.33,"I don't have a clue what youwere talking to Parvati about,"
605,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,and I don't even want to know.But... this is Micronesia 2.0.

609,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,"like a dead man walking,because..."
610,00:33:23.29,00:33:23.29,">> No, I'm gonna be scrambling.>> Because if I am dead man"

700,00:38:19.08,00:38:19.08,Do you think just coming toTribal Council alone will
701,00:38:21.38,00:38:21.38,impact that when you guys goback to camp?
702,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,>> No. I don't think so.I think that when we have a

704,00:38:31.83,00:38:31.83,very quickly on how toaccomplish it.
705,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,"At camp, it's a different story.There's nobody to tell us, ""You"
