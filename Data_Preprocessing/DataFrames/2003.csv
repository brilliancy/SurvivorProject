1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.00,00:00:03.00,Survivor: When the two tribes first hit
3,00:00:06.33,00:00:06.33,"the beach, they stayed true to their nature."
4,00:00:08.83,00:00:08.83,"The Heroes were heroic, and the Villains were villainous."
5,00:00:12.25,00:00:12.25,The Heroes overcame injuries... >> PROBST: ...to win the first
6,00:00:17.17,00:00:17.17,challenge. They also tirelessly worked
7,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,together to build a great camp. >> Watching these guys working
8,00:00:23.54,00:00:23.54,together-- it's good to be a Hero.
9,00:00:25.92,00:00:25.92,>> Villains! >> Get your evil on.
10,00:00:27.92,00:00:27.92,>> PROBST: The Villains did not work together and complained
11,00:00:30.54,00:00:30.54,about everything. >> PROBST: It was the perfect
12,00:00:37.62,00:00:37.62,environment for Russell to work his black magic.
13,00:00:39.67,00:00:39.67,Russell made deals with anyone who would listen and even roped
14,00:00:41.67,00:00:41.67,"in Parvati. >> PROBST: But by day two, the"
15,00:00:48.54,00:00:48.54,"game started to change. At the Heroes' camp, J.T."
16,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,embraced the dark side by making conflicting deals with
17,00:00:54.79,00:00:54.79,James and Tom. >> You're my guy for the end.
18,00:01:01.21,00:01:01.21,">> All right, you got me. >> PROBST: At the Villains'"
19,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,"camp, Boston Rob behaved heroically."
20,00:01:05.04,00:01:05.04,He worked hard around camp and even built a fire without
21,00:01:07.38,00:01:07.38,flint. And after getting sick and
22,00:01:12.08,00:01:12.08,"passing out, he got up and led his tribe to a"
23,00:01:14.88,00:01:14.88,come-from-behind victory at the immunity challenge.
24,00:01:17.62,00:01:17.62,Villains win the second immunity challenge in a row!
25,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,"After their second defeat in a row, the Heroes were"
26,00:01:23.25,00:01:23.25,"demoralized, and James lashed out."
27,00:01:25.50,00:01:25.50,">> He was telling you what to do, and everybody mouth want to"
28,00:01:27.67,00:01:27.67,"talk. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
29,00:01:29.83,00:01:29.83,James continued his tirade. >> You're trying to blame this
30,00:01:32.25,00:01:32.25,entire challenge on me? >> PROBST: And J.T.'s duplicity
31,00:01:35.67,00:01:35.67,was revealed when he chose not to honor his alliance with Tom
32,00:01:39.04,00:01:39.04,"by voting out Tom's closest ally, Stephenie."
33,00:01:41.96,00:01:41.96,"Steph, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left."
34,00:01:43.96,00:01:43.96,Who will be voted out tonight? (squeaking)
35,00:02:10.83,00:02:10.83,">> There's a lot of frustration, James."
36,00:02:12.83,00:02:12.83,"I get that. You could have been gentler,"
37,00:02:15.54,00:02:15.54,that's all. Let's do what we can to get it
38,00:02:18.38,00:02:18.38,"back on track, you know? >> I can't believe..."
39,00:02:20.38,00:02:20.38,>> I think we cleared up a lot of things.
40,00:02:22.42,00:02:22.42,>> Yeah. >> We aired things that needed
41,00:02:24.46,00:02:24.46,"to be said. Um... >> Let's work together, man."
42,00:02:27.71,00:02:27.71,">> That's all I want to do, man. >> Right."
43,00:02:30.25,00:02:30.25,We got a good fire going. >> I love that.
44,00:02:33.12,00:02:33.12,"It's nice to come home to fire. >> At Tribal Council tonight, I"
45,00:02:37.46,00:02:37.46,"mean, just a nasty turn with... All right, Steph's going, and"
46,00:02:41.04,00:02:41.04,"then, James got to bring down, you know, just nasty, brutish"
47,00:02:46.00,00:02:46.00,"bullying on her. The vibe now is, everybody comes"
48,00:02:49.62,00:02:49.62,"home, puts on a happy face, and, uh, tries to make it as pleasant"
49,00:02:54.50,00:02:54.50,as possible to be together. (indistinct chatter)
50,00:02:59.17,00:02:59.17,">> I respect you a lot, Tom. Here's the thing, man."
51,00:03:03.38,00:03:03.38,I'm sorry for-for everything. I-I knew...
52,00:03:10.12,00:03:10.12,">> Right. >> Hey, listen, sometimes with"
53,00:03:16.08,00:03:16.08,"numbers, that's the way the dice come up."
54,00:03:18.12,00:03:18.12,I'm a big boy. I'm okay with that.
55,00:03:20.12,00:03:20.12,">> Hey, I'm sorry, man. >> Nope, it's all good."
56,00:03:22.08,00:03:22.08,It's all good. >> I'll do my best.
57,00:03:24.12,00:03:24.12,">> I feel betrayed by J.T., but if he really does feel bad about"
58,00:03:27.04,00:03:27.04,"it, um, he might be the guy to keep me alive a little longer"
59,00:03:31.12,00:03:31.12,and buy me some extra time if I need it.
60,00:03:43.29,00:03:43.29,>> Right. It's hard to play nice after a
61,00:03:45.46,00:03:45.46,"scene like that, but that's exactly what we need to do."
62,00:03:48.67,00:03:48.67,Right? >> Yeah.
63,00:03:51.12,00:03:51.12,">> To be fair, the game has been ugly, so maybe we were naive to"
64,00:03:55.58,00:03:55.58,"think we were coming back, and it was going to be Marquis of"
65,00:03:59.67,00:03:59.67,"Queensberry rules here and everybody fighting fair, and..."
66,00:04:02.75,00:04:02.75,">> Right. >> So, we know the guys that are"
67,00:04:05.96,00:04:05.96,"playing the game, and, uh, be smarter."
68,00:04:09.58,00:04:09.58,>> Yeah. >> Be smarter.
69,00:04:23.79,00:04:23.79,">> Okay, hold it, hold it. I'm going to try to get in here."
70,00:04:27.88,00:04:27.88,I don't know what... >> Ugh!
71,00:04:29.83,00:04:29.83,"Oh, it hurts! >> Ow! Ow!"
72,00:04:32.46,00:04:32.46,This sucks. >> Oh.
73,00:04:34.42,00:04:34.42,>> Is he moving again? >> Yeah.
74,00:04:36.75,00:04:36.75,">> Does your head stay on his chest, or does it roll off?"
75,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,(laughter) Mine just rolls right off.
76,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,It won't stay. Ew!
77,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,(laughter) Stop it!
78,00:04:49.46,00:04:49.46,(laughter continues) (laughter)
79,00:04:59.62,00:04:59.62,">> Ew! >> I mean, at the end of the"
80,00:05:05.08,00:05:05.08,"day, I wanted to see what would develop, and you notice"
81,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,"different things around camp. I mean, the clearest sign..."
82,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"For anybody that's going to play Survivor in the future, I'm"
83,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,going to give you the key to figuring out who's on what team.
84,00:05:17.83,00:05:17.83,Watch how they sleep at night. Whoever's sleeping next to who--
85,00:05:21.21,00:05:21.21,and I'm even guilty of it-- will tell you who's aligned with who.
86,00:05:25.33,00:05:25.33,"Because at night when you go to sleep, you don't usually go to"
87,00:05:28.33,00:05:28.33,sleep next to the guy who you want to vote off.
88,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,>> All right. Sorry.
89,00:05:34.00,00:05:34.00,>> It's okay. >> I don't trust Russell's ass
90,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,at all. At all.
91,00:05:40.58,00:05:40.58,"I mean, he's running around with puppy doggy eyes over Parvati"
92,00:05:44.79,00:05:44.79,since the minute we landed here. He won't do anything without
93,00:05:47.21,00:05:47.21,her. He has to sleep next to her
94,00:05:49.54,00:05:49.54,every night. Coach and Jerri are trying to do
95,00:05:52.58,00:05:52.58,the same thing. That can be dangerous.
96,00:05:55.17,00:05:55.17,I know. I've been there. And I know how powerful that
97,00:05:59.12,00:05:59.12,kind of an alliance is. >> Our tribe has not been solid
98,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,since we've been together. That's why I was kind of hoping
99,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"for a rainy day that would force us all in the shelter, all day"
100,00:06:26.04,00:06:26.04,"today, and play games and talk and do some bonding stuff and do"
101,00:06:29.21,00:06:29.21,"some empowerment stuff. >> This is the coop, huh? Sweet!"
102,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,">> If we don't become a good, cohesive team, we will continue"
103,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,to lose. >> Get them inside.
104,00:06:40.88,00:06:40.88,(clucking) >> They got out.
105,00:06:47.58,00:06:47.58,">> Hell, yeah! Free chickies!"
106,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,">> Oh, my gosh. >> That's him right there."
107,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,">> Get him out of there. >> Oh, they're right there,"
108,00:06:58.46,00:06:58.46,y'all. Let's just grab them.
109,00:07:00.54,00:07:00.54,">> Grab 'em, bro. (loud clucking)"
110,00:07:02.54,00:07:02.54,">> Okay, there's one of them. >> Hold him."
111,00:07:06.08,00:07:06.08,>> I don't even see the other one.
112,00:07:11.50,00:07:11.50,">> Oh, there he is. >> There he is! There he is!"
113,00:07:13.50,00:07:13.50,There he is! >> Grab him!
114,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,>> Hang on. Don't... Don't get him running.
115,00:07:17.50,00:07:17.50,"Don't get him running. >> He is now wanted, dead or"
116,00:07:19.83,00:07:19.83,"alive, so it's his choice. >> He just went out that way,"
117,00:07:22.58,00:07:22.58,"that way, that way. What?"
118,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,>> There he goes. He's under the shelter.
119,00:07:28.12,00:07:28.12,>> Surround the shelter and let's do the same thing.
120,00:07:30.46,00:07:30.46,>> He's coming out the back. >> That's good. Yeah.
121,00:07:33.25,00:07:33.25,">> Good. >> Good, good, good, Tom, very,"
122,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,very good... (whooping)
123,00:07:39.67,00:07:39.67,">> Still got it! >> Good job, Tom!"
124,00:07:41.71,00:07:41.71,">> It was a neat experience, wrangling the chickens as a"
125,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,"tribe. Um, that's what we need."
126,00:07:53.50,00:07:53.50,">> So in that sense, the chickens getting out was"
127,00:07:55.12,00:07:55.12,supposed to happen to help us bond.
128,00:08:00.67,00:08:00.67,(Rupert snorts) >> They're not going to kill
129,00:08:06.12,00:08:06.12,that thing so fast. >> I can't believe that thing is
130,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,"just sitting there, dude. >> So, what's up, man?"
131,00:08:12.92,00:08:12.92,>> The first vote is the most important vote.
132,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,>> Right. >> You got to be careful.
133,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
134,00:08:19.79,00:08:19.79,"You got to be careful, 'cause people want to have any excuse"
135,00:08:21.83,00:08:21.83,to not be the vote. What is that excuse?
136,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,"""Oh, Russell and Parvati are together."""
137,00:08:25.79,00:08:25.79,>> Right. >> Whatever it is...
138,00:08:27.79,00:08:27.79,>> Right. >> Everybody's going to use an
139,00:08:29.83,00:08:29.83,"excuse so it's not them. Russell, um, is walking on very"
140,00:08:32.25,00:08:32.25,"thin ice. Parvati, in my opinion, is the"
141,00:08:34.92,00:08:34.92,most dangerous player on our tribe.
142,00:08:38.04,00:08:38.04,>> And it's not that we're cool or nothing-- me and Parvati.
143,00:08:41.21,00:08:41.21,"It's because, uh, she's a good asset to the team."
144,00:08:44.21,00:08:44.21,>> For him to be following around Parvati is no strategy
145,00:08:47.58,00:08:47.58,at all. It's puppy love.
146,00:08:50.46,00:08:50.46,She's got the charm. She's got the smile.
147,00:08:52.83,00:08:52.83,"For some reason, when she pays attention to you, you feel like"
148,00:08:55.21,00:08:55.21,you light up. It's not that people don't see
149,00:08:57.62,00:08:57.62,it. It's just that they are allured
150,00:08:59.96,00:08:59.96,"by her charm, and they're taken by it."
151,00:09:02.25,00:09:02.25,They're smitten by it. It's unbelievable.
152,00:09:09.12,00:09:09.12,>> What's the deal? >> Uh...
153,00:09:13.08,00:09:13.08,>> About what? >> Who can kind of...
154,00:09:15.08,00:09:15.08,">> Uh, ultimately, I'm trying to get a feel on Russell on what"
155,00:09:17.04,00:09:17.04,"he's thinking about Parvati, and.."
156,00:09:19.08,00:09:19.08,">> And not for nothing, but I've seen this go down before."
157,00:09:22.33,00:09:22.33,"You got to be careful, you know, the way you're hanging out with"
158,00:09:26.04,00:09:26.04,"her and everything. >> Yeah, I know."
159,00:09:28.04,00:09:28.04,">> And I mean, she might... she might not be the strongest, and"
160,00:09:30.08,00:09:30.08,she got a lot of friends on the other side.
161,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,>> Right. >> And we see you marching
162,00:09:34.83,00:09:34.83,"around with her, so... >> Yeah."
163,00:09:36.71,00:09:36.71,>> ...you have to understand our concern.
164,00:09:38.67,00:09:38.67,">> Oh, I understand it. >> Am I right, or am I right?"
165,00:09:40.54,00:09:40.54,">> Yeah, you're totally right, and it's like it's ostracizing"
166,00:09:42.17,00:09:42.17,you. >> Right.
167,00:09:44.21,00:09:44.21,">> And you got to be cool on that, man."
168,00:09:46.21,00:09:46.21,">> Man. >> I mean, what else can you do?"
169,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,>> You've got to do it. I have no choice.
170,00:09:52.21,00:09:52.21,That would be my... the end of my game...
171,00:09:54.21,00:09:54.21,"Everybody knows Coach is a big joke, so he can go around"
172,00:09:58.62,00:09:58.62,flapping his jaws all he wants. The thing with Rob-- he thinks
173,00:10:02.17,00:10:02.17,"he's the boss of the camp, like that's my daddy."
174,00:10:04.79,00:10:04.79,"Well, I'm the daddy around here. But I got to listen to this fool"
175,00:10:09.58,00:10:09.58,like he's in control. But that's what I have to do to
176,00:10:12.21,00:10:12.21,get to the top. That's what I'm going to have
177,00:10:14.38,00:10:14.38,to do until he's gone. He don't know who he's messing
178,00:10:16.33,00:10:16.33,with. Nobody knows who they're
179,00:10:18.38,00:10:18.38,messing with around here. It's Russell Hantz.
180,00:10:20.62,00:10:20.62,"Give me a break! >> And he's, like, ""No, no."
181,00:10:37.00,00:10:37.00,She'll know something's coming. man.
182,00:10:38.96,00:10:38.96,"Just keep doing what you're doing, brother."""
183,00:10:42.04,00:10:42.04,"""Keep doing what you're doing."""
184,00:10:44.04,00:10:44.04,>> Wow. >> He is after you.
185,00:10:46.04,00:10:46.04,>> He is demented. >> I didn't want your name to
186,00:10:48.17,00:10:48.17,"even be on the block. It worries me because of that,"
187,00:10:50.08,00:10:50.08,so I was... I was even trying to convince him...
188,00:10:52.25,00:10:52.25,">> I'm used to it, honestly. >> I was even trying to convince"
189,00:10:54.25,00:10:54.25,him another way. >> I've dodged a few bullets.
190,00:10:56.29,00:10:56.29,Why do they always want to vote me out?
191,00:10:58.25,00:10:58.25,"I don't know. I'm just a sweet, innocent,"
192,00:11:00.33,00:11:00.33,"little girl, really. (laughs)"
193,00:11:04.62,00:11:04.62,">> And then Rob came over there and said, ""Give us your word"
194,00:11:06.62,00:11:06.62,"you'll get rid of her."" I said, ""Dude, do you seriously"
195,00:11:09.21,00:11:09.21,think I'm here to hook up with a girl?
196,00:11:11.04,00:11:11.04,"I mean, please."" >> I made an alliance really"
197,00:11:13.08,00:11:13.08,"early on with Russell, and so, I don't know what I'm going to"
198,00:11:15.88,00:11:15.88,"have to do, but who else am I going to be with right now"
199,00:11:17.88,00:11:17.88,"besides Russell? I don't trust anyone, and I"
200,00:11:22.33,00:11:22.33,"actually do trust him, even though he's kind of a lunatic."
201,00:11:24.38,00:11:24.38,">> I said I'll show you how to get rid of her, and we'll get"
202,00:11:27.04,00:11:27.04,"rid of her-- and then y'all can trust me then, so she's gone."
203,00:11:31.12,00:11:31.12,Okay? And that's it.
204,00:11:33.83,00:11:33.83,"(Parvati laughs) >> If I'm gone, you're gone"
205,00:11:36.04,00:11:36.04,next. >> Yeah.
206,00:11:37.58,00:11:37.58,>> You know that. >> Yeah. Bye.
207,00:11:52.92,00:11:52.92,">> So I'm three days out, basically, from the, you know,"
208,00:11:56.00,00:11:56.00,"95 degrees, hot as hell, started throwing up."
209,00:11:58.17,00:11:58.17,"My gums were, like, bleeding a little bit."
210,00:12:00.25,00:12:00.25,"I mean, I started getting these big sores on my face."
211,00:12:02.67,00:12:02.67,"I'm, like, all right, what's this?"
212,00:12:04.50,00:12:04.50,>> Is this the same story as last night?
213,00:12:06.33,00:12:06.33,">> Not the same story, my friend."
214,00:12:08.04,00:12:08.04,">> It's not? It's awful similar. >> No, it's not, trust me."
215,00:12:10.54,00:12:10.54,>> Okay. >> So it took me eight days to
216,00:12:12.79,00:12:12.79,"get from, uh... de Los Angeles..."
217,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,"Yeah, I had my compass set on, uh, east-due-east, and I was"
218,00:12:19.79,00:12:19.79,hoping I would make it. So... >> (chuckles): Rob thinks he's
219,00:12:22.83,00:12:22.83,"running the show, and Coach thinks he's running the show."
220,00:12:25.62,00:12:25.62,But I'm gonna take control of that.
221,00:12:27.88,00:12:27.88,They want to play rough? I can play rough.
222,00:12:30.92,00:12:30.92,King Rustall can get rid of the machete.
223,00:12:33.50,00:12:33.50,You know what happens then? Getting rid of the machete will
224,00:12:37.04,00:12:37.04,cause conflict in this camp. Rob's going to go crazy.
225,00:12:40.96,00:12:40.96,The tribe's going to go crazy. Everything's going to go
226,00:12:43.46,00:12:43.46,"haywire. Can't find the machete, can't"
227,00:12:45.71,00:12:45.71,"eat the chickens, can't open the coconuts, can't start fire."
228,00:12:51.04,00:12:51.04,"And that's a good thing. >> 95 degrees, hot as hell, and"
229,00:12:54.54,00:12:54.54,"I was thinking to myself, what am I going to do?"
230,00:12:57.08,00:12:57.08,I've got no water. >> This is going to be
231,00:12:59.12,00:12:59.12,"wonderful, 'cause it's not just going to be the machete."
232,00:13:01.29,00:13:01.29,"Old Boston Rob likes that hat, don't he?"
233,00:13:03.75,00:13:03.75,"I think he will go nuts without his little ""B"" hat."
234,00:13:07.08,00:13:07.08,I don't even like the Boston Red Sox.
235,00:13:09.17,00:13:09.17,"It's the Houston Astros, baby. >> COACH: \xe2\x99\xaa Oh... \xe2\x99\xaa"
236,00:13:25.21,00:13:25.21,>> \xe2\x99\xaa I... Give you...
237,00:13:35.71,00:13:35.71,All of my strength. \xe2\x99\xaa >> Who wants clam?
238,00:13:52.04,00:13:52.04,"Russell, Rob, Parvati? Nobody?"
239,00:13:56.00,00:13:56.00,>> I'm fine without a clam right now.
240,00:13:58.17,00:13:58.17,>> Courtney? 'Cause I don't want it to spoil
241,00:14:01.17,00:14:01.17,'cause it's out of the water and I don't want it to... you
242,00:14:03.79,00:14:03.79,"know, go to waste, and I don't want to eat it all, either."
243,00:14:06.42,00:14:06.42,">> Well, just eat a little bit of it and throw it away."
244,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,>> All right. >> Machete?
245,00:14:23.96,00:14:23.96,>> Damn. I did find one giant clam that
246,00:14:36.08,00:14:36.08,"was good for five or six bites of food, but nobody cared."
247,00:14:40.04,00:14:40.04,"You know, I'm used to seeing on Survivor where somebody brings"
248,00:14:43.17,00:14:43.17,"a fish in this size, and the entire tribe swarms him hoping"
249,00:14:47.54,00:14:47.54,"to get an ounce of meat, and you eat what you can eat when you"
250,00:14:51.83,00:14:51.83,"can get it and you don't ask questions, 'cause you don't"
251,00:14:54.46,00:14:54.46,know where your next food is coming from.
252,00:14:59.04,00:14:59.04,">> Randy, this thing cuts good. >> Ew."
253,00:15:04.04,00:15:04.04,>> Got to eat. You don't like it?
254,00:15:07.79,00:15:07.79,>> You want a white piece? Of this?
255,00:15:10.67,00:15:10.67,(Parvati spits) >> Sorry.
256,00:15:12.67,00:15:12.67,>> No? >> I can't eat it.
257,00:15:15.54,00:15:15.54,"It makes me gag. >> No, we're not gonna waste"
258,00:15:18.00,00:15:18.00,"this on you. >> Mm-mm, don't do it."
259,00:15:20.50,00:15:20.50,>> We won't. (laughter)
260,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17,">> Survivor, in so many ways, is like the real world--"
261,00:15:25.50,00:15:25.50,you don't get ahead by being smart...
262,00:15:30.21,00:15:30.21,"clever, hardworking. You get ahead, unfortunately,"
263,00:15:34.08,00:15:34.08,with a pretty smile and being able to schmooze people.
264,00:15:38.25,00:15:38.25,"And Parvati is the queen. You know, this whole game is"
265,00:15:43.92,00:15:43.92,"designed to mess with everybody's nerves, and it"
266,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,works. >> The team's only as good as
267,00:15:50.54,00:15:50.54,its weakest player. And that's why we never get
268,00:15:53.88,00:15:53.88,anything done around camp. Because the weakest players
269,00:15:56.46,00:15:56.46,just sit there and think that they can look pretty and cute
270,00:15:59.08,00:15:59.08,and have everything handed to them. Right?
271,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,>> Well... let's vote them out. >> I personally can't stand it
272,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17,when I see people that are loafers and people that are
273,00:16:08.21,00:16:08.21,weak. It's not fair.
274,00:16:09.88,00:16:09.88,"It's just simply unjust. And it's selfish, and it's"
275,00:16:14.42,00:16:14.42,"egotistical that ""I can do nothing, sit back, feed me"
276,00:16:19.25,00:16:19.25,"grapes like a Greek goddess."" It's just... the whole thing"
277,00:16:23.42,00:16:23.42,"just stinks. >> You know, I think you're a"
278,00:16:38.42,00:16:38.42,"great player, and, um... I'd like to make it to the end."
279,00:16:44.08,00:16:44.08,">> Yeah, I do, too. >> But if somebody's not"
280,00:16:46.54,00:16:46.54,"talking to me strategy, they're talking to somebody else."
281,00:16:49.17,00:16:49.17,>> Mm-hmm. >> And when you come talking
282,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,"with somebody on the day we're going to Tribal Council, that"
283,00:16:52.88,00:16:52.88,doesn't count. You know what I mean?
284,00:16:55.17,00:16:55.17,'Cause you need a favor then. >> Candice is beginning to
285,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,scare me a lot. She's much more strategical
286,00:17:00.12,00:17:00.12,than I gave her credit for to begin with.
287,00:17:03.38,00:17:03.38,>> I think Cirie is trustworthy if... she feels safe within...
288,00:17:06.79,00:17:06.79,>> If she feels safe. Candice may be the next one
289,00:17:09.25,00:17:09.25,"to go, in my opinion, but, you know, it's not all up to me."
290,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,Not in this group. >> What are your thoughts?
291,00:17:16.04,00:17:16.04,Everything still good? >> It's hard to trust anyone
292,00:17:18.38,00:17:18.38,out here right now. >> Mm. Tell me about it.
293,00:17:28.08,00:17:28.08,(laughs) >> Okay.
294,00:17:31.08,00:17:31.08,>> I got her. I can get rid of her. (laughs)
295,00:17:33.58,00:17:33.58,I can tell a story when I need to.
296,00:17:36.08,00:17:36.08,I think my lying ability is... probably better than it should
297,00:17:39.50,00:17:39.50,be. Considering I don't do it very
298,00:17:42.08,00:17:42.08,"much in everyday life, I'm pretty good at it out here."
299,00:17:45.29,00:17:45.29,(water splashing) >> I'm-I'm nervous now.
300,00:17:50.00,00:17:50.00,>> About what? >> About us.
301,00:17:52.12,00:17:52.12,>> You're nervous about me and you?
302,00:17:54.21,00:17:54.21,>> Yeah. >> Why? What...
303,00:17:56.00,00:17:56.00,>> I hear-hear stuff. >> Tell me what you hear.
304,00:17:59.04,00:17:59.04,">> That you don't trust me, and..."
305,00:18:02.12,00:18:02.12,>> Who said that? (Cirie laughs)
306,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,>> I don't want to say who said it-- I just want to...
307,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,">> Well, it doesn't matter who said it, 'cause it's not true."
308,00:18:09.50,00:18:09.50,"I'm thinking, where did that come from, because I have never"
309,00:18:12.12,00:18:12.12,said that. Either somebody is trying to
310,00:18:16.33,00:18:16.33,"make sure that she and I don't trust each other, or I'm"
311,00:18:21.21,00:18:21.21,thinking there's something weird going on.
312,00:18:24.38,00:18:24.38,Did you tell Cirie in any way that... I said or that I don't
313,00:18:28.96,00:18:28.96,trust her? >> Absolutely not.
314,00:18:31.58,00:18:31.58,>> Okay. She's hearing around that I
315,00:18:34.50,00:18:34.50,said I don't trust her. >> I've never heard you talk
316,00:18:37.04,00:18:37.04,"bad about Cirie. >> No, and I haven't."
317,00:18:43.29,00:18:43.29,Cirie just told me that somebody is telling her that I
318,00:18:47.29,00:18:47.29,said I don't trust her. >> I don't have any idea what
319,00:18:49.83,00:18:49.83,you're talking about. I just wish you would just chill
320,00:18:52.04,00:18:52.04,"out just for a second, just for a little while, and then we'd be"
321,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,"all right. Candice, I mean, she's a nut."
322,00:18:58.50,00:18:58.50,Everybody's going to play with Candice 'cause she's hustling
323,00:19:00.79,00:19:00.79,a little bit too much. I don't know what's wrong with
324,00:19:02.83,00:19:02.83,"the girl. Like, I don't even care about"
325,00:19:04.67,00:19:04.67,the whole... we can't even focus on all that stuff right now.
326,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,It's pointless to even worry about all that.
327,00:19:09.42,00:19:09.42,I just want to get to challenges and win.
328,00:19:14.92,00:19:14.92,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

476,00:26:46.33,00:26:46.33,Should be an interesting afternoon.
477,00:26:48.46,00:26:48.46,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
478,00:26:50.50,00:26:50.50,I will see you at Tribal. (laughter)

481,00:27:24.67,00:27:24.67,"mud. >> Yeah, those Heroes were"
482,00:27:27.67,00:27:27.67,waiting to wallop on us a bit. I guess they must have all
483,00:27:31.08,00:27:31.08,"eaten steroid sandwiches right before the, uh... the challenge."
484,00:27:35.04,00:27:35.04,"They were all crazy-eyed, and, uh, it was almost scary to look"
485,00:27:39.29,00:27:39.29,"in their faces. Not that it was intimidating,"
486,00:27:44.04,00:27:44.04,but I worried for their sanity. >> There you go.
487,00:27:46.21,00:27:46.21,>> A mess. Everyone's a mess.
488,00:27:48.25,00:27:48.25,">> Little pigpen. From the, uh... the Muppets?"
489,00:27:51.21,00:27:51.21,>> The Peanuts. >> Peanuts.
490,00:27:53.38,00:27:53.38,>> You don't even have to be told that your name is on the
491,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,block. You can just sense it.
492,00:27:57.75,00:27:57.75,"I'm the oldest guy in the game, I'm the oldest guy in this"
493,00:28:00.38,00:28:00.38,"tribe, and Russell and Boston Rob and probably Tyson are"
494,00:28:03.96,00:28:03.96,falling for the oldest trick in the book since cave man days
495,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,that these girls can get what they want if they bat their
496,00:28:12.50,00:28:12.50,eyes and flirt. >> Scrubbing is involved.
497,00:28:15.88,00:28:15.88,>> Yeah. >> Parvati is a threat right
498,00:28:18.12,00:28:18.12,"now, even though she may be in a minority in this tribe."
499,00:28:23.46,00:28:23.46,But if we overlook her because she's got a pretty smile and a
500,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,"nice wiggle, she's going to be trouble when she meets up with"
501,00:28:29.88,00:28:29.88,"her old friends James, Cirie and Amanda."
502,00:28:33.08,00:28:33.08,And we could all pay dearly for not taking care of business
503,00:28:36.92,00:28:36.92,"right now, and by taking care of business, I mean getting her"
504,00:28:40.12,00:28:40.12,"out of here as soon as possible. >> No, I'm..."
505,00:28:46.58,00:28:46.58,I have not made my bet yet. >> Answer the question.
506,00:28:48.58,00:28:48.58,>> I have not made my bet yet. >> I hardly ever even talk
507,00:28:53.46,00:28:53.46,strategy. The only person I talk strategy
508,00:28:55.29,00:28:55.29,"with is Randy, because he's a a super fan."
509,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,">> Oh, Coach, please. Every time I see you, you're"
510,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,"running around grabbing someone, trying to talk to them."
511,00:29:01.00,00:29:01.00,>> That is not true. That is totally not true.
512,00:29:03.04,00:29:03.04,That is not true. I don't lie.
513,00:29:05.04,00:29:05.04,"You know, Parvati came at me real aggressive in the water"
514,00:29:07.25,00:29:07.25,"today saying, ""You know, are you targeting me?"""
515,00:29:09.17,00:29:09.17,"I kept trying to fend off her question, and yet she thinks"
516,00:29:12.58,00:29:12.58,that she can bat her eyelashes and wiggle her hips and roll
517,00:29:15.21,00:29:15.21,down a very short bathing suit already to make it even more
518,00:29:19.12,00:29:19.12,"skimpy, and everybody will follow her around."
519,00:29:21.12,00:29:21.12,"Well, maybe Russell will, maybe other people will."
520,00:29:23.12,00:29:23.12,Maybe Tyson will. I sure as hell won't.
521,00:29:25.12,00:29:25.12,">> I don't want to go, and I don't think I'm the weakest."
522,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,I think I would be a poor choice to go.
523,00:29:28.83,00:29:28.83,I think you could use me to your advantage.
524,00:29:30.83,00:29:30.83,>> That stuff doesn't work on me.
525,00:29:32.75,00:29:32.75,"I've been coaching college soccer for women for 13 years,"
526,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,and I've never had one of those girls bat their eyes at me and
527,00:29:36.71,00:29:36.71,make a difference in their playing time.
528,00:29:43.67,00:29:43.67,">> Never. Fear's never controlled me,"
529,00:29:45.67,00:29:45.67,and flirting has never controlled me.
530,00:29:47.67,00:29:47.67,I'm my own man. >> Really?
531,00:29:49.67,00:29:49.67,>> I'm going to make my decision...
532,00:29:51.67,00:29:51.67,>> I just want you to know. I don't think any flirting
533,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,controls anyone. >> But I do like flirting with
534,00:29:55.67,00:29:55.67,you. >> I think it's ridiculous that
535,00:29:57.67,00:29:57.67,people think that. >> So out here with a million
536,00:29:59.71,00:29:59.71,"dollars on the line, certainly isn't going to happen."
537,00:30:01.92,00:30:01.92,And anybody that lets it happen will be a fool.
538,00:30:05.12,00:30:05.12,">> Parvati has too many friends on the other side, and they're"
539,00:30:08.29,00:30:08.29,controlling that game over there.
540,00:30:10.71,00:30:10.71,"Randy has no friends anywhere, here or there."
541,00:30:14.08,00:30:14.08,She's dangerous. Randy is not dangerous.
542,00:30:16.38,00:30:16.38,"What do you think? >> Amanda, come here."
543,00:30:18.67,00:30:18.67,Are you hearing this? >> I heard him.
544,00:30:20.62,00:30:20.62,It has to be a group effort. It can't be two or three
545,00:30:22.62,00:30:22.62,going... You know what I'm saying?
546,00:30:24.62,00:30:24.62,">> I know. >> Like, it has to be the"
547,00:30:26.62,00:30:26.62,"majority, and what is the majority?"
548,00:30:28.62,00:30:28.62,Randy is weak. Why would we want to weaken our
549,00:30:30.67,00:30:30.67,tribe? >> I just know she has a ton of
550,00:30:32.62,00:30:32.62,friends over there. >> I'd rather take Randy out
551,00:30:34.62,00:30:34.62,"than Parvati. >> So, let's make a decision."
552,00:30:36.62,00:30:36.62,People are coming. >> Parvati is like a virus.
553,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,"That girl needs to go. She has a way of just, like,"
554,00:30:43.96,00:30:43.96,"roping people in, even when they don't want anything to do with"
555,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,her. I'm going to find out how to
556,00:30:51.25,00:30:51.25,"bottle that up and use it in my real life, 'cause it's pretty"
557,00:30:56.08,00:30:56.08,powerful stuff. >> I'm safe tonight.
558,00:30:58.92,00:30:58.92,You're safe tonight. We know the two people whose
559,00:31:01.04,00:31:01.04,"names are there, um, and I don't know what to do."
560,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,You know? I don't know where you're at.
561,00:31:06.75,00:31:06.75,>> I'm going to tell you like this.
562,00:31:09.00,00:31:09.00,"I'm not in trouble. >> I don't want to, either."
563,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,">> Therefore, I don't need... >> I feel the same way."
564,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,">> All I'm going to do is, where's everybody at?"
565,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,"Boom, that's it, done. That's it."
566,00:31:17.54,00:31:17.54,"If they all want him out, that's who I'll write."
567,00:31:20.08,00:31:20.08,"If they all want her out, that's who I'll write."
568,00:31:22.25,00:31:22.25,That's it. Let me go do this thing.
569,00:31:25.17,00:31:25.17,">> Okay. >> It doesn't matter, either."
570,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,"It's just a matter... He's, obviously, the weakest"
571,00:31:36.25,00:31:36.25,"link, so... >> Yeah. I mean, this is a lot"
572,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,of... >> We don't have to play that
573,00:31:40.88,00:31:40.88,"card, but a lot of people want to, and that's... it's"
574,00:31:42.83,00:31:42.83,"overall just... >> I know, but I'm just going"
575,00:31:44.83,00:31:44.83,to say it again because... Everyone...
576,00:31:46.83,00:31:46.83,I think everyone has their own strength...
577,00:31:48.83,00:31:48.83,">> Yeah, but if we vote him out tonight, they'll have to sit out"
578,00:31:50.83,00:31:50.83,"one of their strong guys in the next challenge, so that will"
579,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,"give us a fighting chance. >> I mean, we don't know."
580,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,">> Yeah, you don't know. >> Yeah."
581,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,>> I'm just saying that that's...
582,00:32:01.88,00:32:01.88,">> Well, if you're going to say not Randy, then you have to say"
583,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,someone else? >> I don't have to say.
584,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,>> Why not? >> Because I don't know.
585,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
586,00:32:11.29,00:32:11.29,">> Well, but if you're trying to get someone to vote for someone,"
587,00:32:13.54,00:32:13.54,you have to say who. >> I'm not trying to get anybody
588,00:32:15.58,00:32:15.58,"to vote for anybody yet. I don't know what's going on,"
589,00:32:17.75,00:32:17.75,honestly. Moments like that drive me up
590,00:32:19.75,00:32:19.75,the wall. That girl-- she thinks that she
591,00:32:22.71,00:32:22.71,"can make people do whatever she wants, and people are, but I'm"
592,00:32:26.62,00:32:26.62,not. I am not.
593,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,"I'm at the point right now, where every time I'm around"
594,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,"here, I just want to punch her in the face."
595,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,That's all I can think about is just taking her down.
596,00:32:36.17,00:32:36.17,"Boy, I'll tell you what. >> Jerri's annoying."
597,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,"(laughs) I mean, she is the fakest"
598,00:32:43.67,00:32:43.67,Fakey McGee I've ever met. I know she's running around
599,00:32:46.92,00:32:46.92,"behind my back talking about me. She's just, like, a bitter old"
600,00:32:50.00,00:32:50.00,"cougar, and I think her days are numbered, too."
601,00:32:52.83,00:32:52.83,">> I loved it when I saw Stephenie gone, 'cause that"
602,00:32:56.25,00:32:56.25,should make it clear to you what's going on.
603,00:32:58.46,00:32:58.46,It should make it clear to Rob what's going on.
604,00:33:00.83,00:33:00.83,"If you guys don't see that, you're next."
605,00:33:05.33,00:33:05.33,"I don't have a clue what you were talking to Parvati about,"
606,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,and I don't even want to know. But... this is Micronesia 2.0.
607,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,">> Oh, it is. >> And if you guys don't see"
608,00:33:15.96,00:33:15.96,"that, I don't want to play the game with you anymore, I really"
609,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,don't. I'm not going to scramble today
610,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,"like a dead man walking, because..."
611,00:33:23.29,00:33:23.29,">> No, I'm gonna be scrambling. >> Because if I am dead man"
612,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,walking... (laughs) a lot of my friends are next.
613,00:33:30.67,00:33:30.67,"And, you know, I'll see you in Loser's Lodge."
614,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,I'll buy you a beer. >> There's nobody out here
615,00:33:38.04,00:33:38.04,that's honorable. There's nobody out here that's
616,00:33:40.96,00:33:40.96,honorable... anymore. Except for me.
617,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,"I hate to pontificate about that but, you know, Martin"
618,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,Luther King says that the greatest measure of a man is
619,00:33:53.12,00:33:53.12,"not in the way he handles times of comfort, but in the way he"
620,00:33:59.08,00:33:59.08,rises with controversy and challenge.
621,00:34:03.62,00:34:03.62,There's always hope. The last thing we have in life
622,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,"or in this game is hope that the impossible happens, that we"
623,00:34:11.75,00:34:11.75,"dare to dream, that Randy's going to wake up in this camp"
624,00:34:14.83,00:34:14.83,"tomorrow. So yes, there's still hope."
625,00:34:17.21,00:34:17.21,"While I still have a breath and a brain cell in my brain, I"
626,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,will fight for him. >> PROBST: Behind each of you
627,00:34:45.04,00:34:45.04,is a torch. Go ahead and grab one.
628,00:34:46.79,00:34:46.79,Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of
629,00:34:51.67,00:34:51.67,"Tribal Council, because in this game fire represents your life."
630,00:34:54.62,00:34:54.62,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
631,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
632,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,"Sandra, when you play a game like this with 20 people who"
633,00:35:05.29,00:35:05.29,"have all played-- some two, some three times-- how big a"
634,00:35:09.00,00:35:09.00,"consideration is past relationships, whether within"
635,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,this tribe or people that are on the other tribe?
636,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,>> There's a lot of things we take into consideration.
637,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,"One, who's won before. Who's been out here three times."
638,00:35:21.12,00:35:21.12,Who has friends on another tribe.
639,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,"For instance, with Parvati, we're thinking, okay, Cirie's"
640,00:35:26.83,00:35:26.83,"over there, James is over there, Amanda's over there."
641,00:35:29.71,00:35:29.71,"Like, how far do we want them to go, and then, once we merge,"
642,00:35:33.75,00:35:33.75,"are we screwed? >> PROBST: Parvati, you're"
643,00:35:36.79,00:35:36.79,"shaking your head. >> Yeah, everyone's nervous"
644,00:35:38.79,00:35:38.79,about me flipping if a merge comes.
645,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,All I can say is that I want to stick true to this tribe.
646,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,"But, you know, it's words, and in this game, your word doesn't"
647,00:35:47.25,00:35:47.25,mean that much. It's really your actions that
648,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"matter. >> PROBST: Russell, what kind"
649,00:35:51.96,00:35:51.96,of weight do you give that? >> I think it is a huge
650,00:35:54.92,00:35:54.92,advantage that somebody might know three or four people on
651,00:35:58.67,00:35:58.67,the other tribe. It's a huge advantage.
652,00:36:02.38,00:36:02.38,">> PROBST: Jerri, do you think tonight's vote should be based"
653,00:36:04.75,00:36:04.75,on performances at challenges? >> I think the physical side of
654,00:36:08.08,00:36:08.08,"this is very important for us. This is our first loss, and we"
655,00:36:12.17,00:36:12.17,don't want to lose any more. But I know myself I'm still
656,00:36:14.88,00:36:14.88,"taking into account all the other factors, relationships"
657,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,"and all that sort of thing. >> PROBST: So for you, past"
658,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,"relationships, whether within your own tribe or the other"
659,00:36:23.00,00:36:23.00,"tribe, is a big factor? >> I think it should be a big"
660,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,"factor for everyone. >> PROBST: Sandra, is there a"
661,00:36:29.58,00:36:29.58,"leader on this tribe? >> Well, it all depends on what"
662,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,"we're doing. If we're building the shelter,"
663,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,"we start listening to him, and then when it gets too much,"
664,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,"then we go off on our own. And then Coach'll delegate,"
665,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,"""You do this and I'll do this and we'll go do that,"" but then"
666,00:36:42.54,00:36:42.54,"when you look, Coach is gone two miles out."
667,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,">> Sandra, you only mentioned me in that, and I don't know if"
668,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,"it's a jibe at me, but that's a bunch of bull."
669,00:36:51.62,00:36:51.62,"I collected firewood for three hours, thank you very much."
670,00:36:54.50,00:36:54.50,Nobody's out there collecting firewood like I am.
671,00:36:56.58,00:36:56.58,"I've been working hard around camp, and I resent you for"
672,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,"saying that. In fact, why do you think we"
673,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,have the worst shelter in Survivor history?
674,00:37:03.25,00:37:03.25,Because it's like herding cats. >> It's not the worst shelter
675,00:37:05.96,00:37:05.96,"in Survivor history-- I was in that one, actually."
676,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,>> I'd argue that I was also a part of one of those
677,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,contenders. >> I want to say one other
678,00:37:12.71,00:37:12.71,thing to Sandra. If you think I'm not pulling my
679,00:37:14.79,00:37:14.79,"weight around camp and in the challenges, then put my name"
680,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,"down on the paper tonight. >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
681,00:37:19.12,00:37:19.12,"That's not what I'm saying. >> Well, that's what you made it"
682,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,sound like. You made it sound like I'm an
683,00:37:22.83,00:37:22.83,ass that sits there that wants to be a leader and then doesn't
684,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,do any work. >> And we ain't got a machete!
685,00:37:28.04,00:37:28.04,We haven't had a machete all day.
686,00:37:30.75,00:37:30.75,">> PROBST: What do you mean, you have no machete?"
687,00:37:33.04,00:37:33.04,>> It grew legs and walked off. (Probst laughs)
688,00:37:35.62,00:37:35.62,">> We have three chickens, though."
689,00:37:38.38,00:37:38.38,">> PROBST: Parvati, you guys are literally laughing about"
690,00:37:41.21,00:37:41.21,how bad it is at camp. >> We're kind of a tribe full
691,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"of misfits, Jeff. We're the Villains."
692,00:37:48.00,00:37:48.00,">> Russell, what are you making of this tribe you're on?"
693,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,>> It's definitely different. The dodos I played with last
694,00:37:54.75,00:37:54.75,time couldn't hold a candle to any one of these players.
695,00:37:58.12,00:37:58.12,">> Mm... >> So it's fun, but it's a lot"
696,00:38:00.96,00:38:00.96,"harder, because you have everybody playing the game."
697,00:38:05.29,00:38:05.29,"But that's what I like, and that's what I want to see, and"
698,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,"that's what I respect. >> PROBST: Rob, given how well"
699,00:38:12.38,00:38:12.38,"you guys have done overall at the challenges so far, I'm a"
700,00:38:15.29,00:38:15.29,little surprised at the lack of cohesiveness within the group.
701,00:38:19.08,00:38:19.08,Do you think just coming to Tribal Council alone will
702,00:38:21.38,00:38:21.38,impact that when you guys go back to camp?
703,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,>> No. I don't think so. I think that when we have a
704,00:38:28.50,00:38:28.50,"challenge, we know what we have to do, and we figure out a way"
705,00:38:31.83,00:38:31.83,very quickly on how to accomplish it.
706,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,"At camp, it's a different story. There's nobody to tell us, ""You"
707,00:38:37.96,00:38:37.96,"need to make your shelter better,"" or ""You need to"
708,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,"collect firewood."" There's not that sense of"
709,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,urgency. So I don't think it will change.
710,00:38:48.04,00:38:48.04,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
711,00:38:49.38,00:38:49.38,"Russell, you're up. >> It was either you or me"
712,00:39:06.25,00:39:06.25,"tonight, and I wasn't gonna go down without a fight."
713,00:39:42.50,00:39:42.50,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
714,00:39:52.12,00:39:52.12,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
715,00:39:54.38,00:39:54.38,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
716,00:39:57.38,00:39:57.38,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
717,00:40:03.12,00:40:03.12,First vote... Randy.
718,00:40:09.46,00:40:09.46,Rob. One vote Rob.
719,00:40:14.33,00:40:14.33,"Randy. Two votes Randy, one vote Rob."
720,00:40:21.04,00:40:21.04,"Randy. That's three votes Randy, one"
721,00:40:23.21,00:40:23.21,vote Rob. Randy.
722,00:40:29.04,00:40:29.04,"Four votes Randy, one vote Rob. Randy."
723,00:40:35.17,00:40:35.17,"That's five votes Randy, one vote Rob."
724,00:40:39.38,00:40:39.38,Third person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs.
725,00:40:42.04,00:40:42.04,Villains... Randy.
726,00:40:43.46,00:40:43.46,That's six; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
727,00:40:55.67,00:40:55.67,"Randy, the tribe has spoken. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
728,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"Well, even though we're only eight days into the game, if"
729,00:41:15.17,00:41:15.17,"you don't get your camp life together, it will catch up to"
730,00:41:18.67,00:41:18.67,"you, and you will be coming back to Tribal, and more people"
731,00:41:21.08,00:41:21.08,will be going home. Grab your torches.
732,00:41:23.17,00:41:23.17,Head back to camp. Good night.
733,00:41:40.83,00:41:40.83,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
734,00:41:47.04,00:41:47.04,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
735,00:41:48.67,00:41:48.67,Coach melts down. >> Why does nobody say anything
736,00:41:52.62,00:41:52.62,good about me? >> I think I'll go this way.
737,00:41:55.25,00:41:55.25,>> PROBST: The Hero tribe splinters apart while looking
738,00:41:57.54,00:41:57.54,for the hidden immunity idol. >> This is not a group effort.
739,00:42:00.17,00:42:00.17,It's every man for himself. >> PROBST: And the clock is
740,00:42:02.04,00:42:02.04,ticking on Russell. >> Russell's a bonehead.
741,00:42:06.21,00:42:06.21,It's time for him to go home. >> It was definitely a mistake
742,00:42:14.62,00:42:14.62,"for this tribe not to vote out Parvati, but I knew Parvati"
