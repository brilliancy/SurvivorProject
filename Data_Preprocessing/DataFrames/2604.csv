188,00:10:20.23,00:10:20.23,>> LAURA DEFINITELY SLOWED US DOWN.
189,00:10:22.47,00:10:22.47,"LET'S JUST VOTE HER OFF, SHE'S WEAK, CAN WE JUST MOVE ON."
190,00:10:24.87,00:10:24.87,WE HAVE TO START WINNING CHALLENGES OR WE'RE ALL SCREWED.
191,00:10:43.07,00:10:43.07,>> HEY! LOOK AT OUR LITTLE GUY!
192,00:10:44.87,00:10:44.87,>> WHERE? (APPLAUSE)
193,00:10:48.53,00:10:48.53,>> SO THE FAVORITES WON THE REWARD CHALLENGE AND WE GOT TO
194,00:10:51.40,00:10:51.40,HAVE A LOCAL BUSHMAN COME TO CAMP AND INTRODUCE US TO WAYS OF
195,00:10:55.77,00:10:55.77,IMPROVING OUR CAMP FOR US AS WELL AS COOK A GREAT FEAST FOR
196,00:11:00.87,00:11:00.87,US. >> WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED.
197,00:11:02.83,00:11:02.83,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
198,00:11:05.00,00:11:05.00,NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED US FOR THIS LITTLE GUY.
199,00:11:07.37,00:11:07.37,"HIS NAME WAS TATA. HE'S ABOUT FOUR FEET TALL, 60"
200,00:11:10.70,00:11:10.70,"YEARS OLD, HE'S ALL KNOTTED UP WITH MUSCLE AND HE HITS THE"
201,00:11:14.80,00:11:14.80,BEACH -- HE DOESN'T MESS AROUND. >> LIKE A POT!
202,00:11:49.47,00:11:49.47,>> IT WAS ENTERTAINING MORE THAN ANYTHING.
203,00:11:51.63,00:11:51.63,IT WAS JUST FUN TO WATCH HIM. YOU COULD ONLY UNDERSTAND HALF
204,00:11:54.33,00:11:54.33,OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING ANYWAYS. HE'S LIKE A FILIPINO GOLLUM.
205,00:12:00.53,00:12:00.53,">> OOH, VERY NICE LOAF. VERY HOT!"
206,00:12:05.17,00:12:05.17,"OKAY, COOK RICE. >> AS WE GOT TO FORM AS MUCH OF"
207,00:12:08.57,00:12:08.57,"A RAPPORT AS YOU CAN FORM WITH SOMEONE LIKE TATA THE BUSHMAN,"
208,00:12:12.20,00:12:12.20,WE GOT A SENSE OF HOW HE FUNCTIONS AND THE WAY HE
209,00:12:14.67,00:12:14.67,FUNCTIONS IS SAYING ENIGMATIC LITTLE THINGS NOBODY
210,00:12:18.17,00:12:18.17,"UNDERSTANDS. >> HERE IN THE JUNGLE, NO"
211,00:12:23.23,00:12:23.23,MATCHES. >> NO BITCHING?
212,00:12:25.33,00:12:25.33,NO BITCHING IN THE JUNGLE? I LIKE THAT.
213,00:12:27.37,00:12:27.37,>> BUT HE CREATED AN UNBELIEVABLE FEAST FOR US.
214,00:12:30.03,00:12:30.03,WE'VE BEEN EATING RICE BUT HE PREPARED THIS RICE PHRAULESSLY
215,00:12:33.33,00:12:33.33,AND HE MADE CHICKEN AND POTATOES AND ONIONS CREATED IN A WAY THAT
216,00:12:38.33,00:12:38.33,OSTENSIBLY WE COULD DO ONCE HE'S GONE.
217,00:12:40.07,00:12:40.07,"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING, IT WAS GREAT TO"
218,00:12:42.97,00:12:42.97,WATCH. IT WAS DINNER AND A SHOW.
219,00:12:44.60,00:12:44.60,"AND, YOU KNOW, ACTUAL HOME IMPROVEMENT CAME ALONG WITH IT."
220,00:12:49.87,00:12:49.87,>> I ALMOST FELT BAD BECAUSE THESE FANS ARE LOSING AND LOSING
221,00:12:55.93,00:12:55.93,AND THIS WAS A REWARD THEY COULD HAVE USED.
222,00:12:58.67,00:12:58.67,IT BOOSTED THE MORALE OF OUR TRIBE EVEN MORE.
223,00:13:01.90,00:13:01.90,">> OH, YEAH! >> TATA IS A MARRIED MAN BUT"
224,00:13:05.57,00:13:05.57,THAT DOESN'T IMPEDING HIM FROM BUMPING AND GRINDING WITH THE
225,00:13:08.20,00:13:08.20,GIRLS IN THE FAVORITES TRIBE. SINCE HE'S THIS BIZARRE LITTLE
226,00:13:11.63,00:13:11.63,WOODLAND CREATURE HE GETS AWAY WITH THAT.
227,00:13:13.63,00:13:13.63,IF I TRIED THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE I'M A CREEPY PREDATOR BUT THE
228,00:13:17.40,00:13:17.40,"GIRLS FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL, THEY WERE ALL KISSING HIM ON THE"
229,00:13:19.87,00:13:19.87,CHEEK WHICH I'M SURE WILL PROVIDE HIM WITH FODDER FOR
230,00:13:22.70,00:13:22.70,YEARS TO COME IN HIS MIND AND HEART.
231,00:13:25.33,00:13:25.33,">> (LAUGHS) WOW, WOW, OH, MY GOSH!"
232,00:13:38.97,00:13:38.97,">> I WAS ON THE BOTTOM, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE LOST."
233,00:13:41.67,00:13:41.67,"I THOUGHT WE WON! >> SUCKS, MAN."
234,00:13:44.00,00:13:44.00,">> TODAY, YOU KNOW, WE LOST AGAIN AND I WAS SO MAD."
235,00:13:47.43,00:13:47.43,THE FAVORITES HAVE EVERYTHING! THEY'VE WON EVERY REWARD SO THEY
236,00:13:52.27,00:13:52.27,HAVE THIS BOUNTY OF STUFF BACK AT THEIR CAMP.
237,00:13:57.10,00:13:57.10,I MEAN -- SONS OF BITCHES. I WAS SO MAD.
238,00:14:01.13,00:14:01.13,I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE LOSING SO MUCH.
239,00:14:08.83,00:14:08.83,>> HE JUST SITS IN THE SHELTER ALL DAY LONG.
240,00:14:12.00,00:14:12.00,HOW DO YOU DO THAT? WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM THE
241,00:14:16.27,00:14:16.27,CHALLENGE SHAMAR WENT BACK INTO THE SHELTER.
242,00:14:18.37,00:14:18.37,HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. HE'S JUST PURE LAZINESS.
243,00:14:21.80,00:14:21.80,THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO BE LAYING IN THE SHELTER FOR 19
244,00:14:24.63,00:14:24.63,HOURS. SHAMAR IS THE BIGGEST PAIN IN
245,00:14:26.30,00:14:26.30,"THE ASS IN THIS TRIBE. >> YOU WANT TO GO GET IT,"
246,00:14:31.37,00:14:31.37,SHAMAR? >> I'M EXHAUSTED.
247,00:14:34.17,00:14:34.17,CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING MY SIZE AND HOW I FEEL?
248,00:14:38.97,00:14:38.97,I'M NOT LEAVING BUT Y'ALL GOING TO BRING ME RICE ONCE A DAY.
249,00:14:49.93,00:14:49.93,>> ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS? >> (BLEEP) BE MY SLAVE AND THEN
250,00:14:55.27,00:14:55.27,I'LL SAY IN THE GAME. >> IT'S NOT RIGHT.
251,00:14:57.23,00:14:57.23,>> THE OTHER DAY SHAMAR SAID HE WAS GOING TO QUIT BUT HE DECIDED
252,00:15:01.10,00:15:01.10,"TO STAY. HOWEVER, TODAY HE SAID WELL,"
253,00:15:04.40,00:15:04.40,HERE ARE MY TERMS. I WILL STICK IT OUT IF I CAN LAY
254,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,HERE IN THE SHACK AND YOU GUYS WILL SERVE ME RICE AT LEAST ONCE
255,00:15:11.67,00:15:11.67,A DAY. AND I'M JUST THINKING HOW MUCH
256,00:15:13.37,00:15:13.37,LONGER THIS GO ON? >> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
257,00:15:16.80,00:15:16.80,CAN'T YOU JUST GET UP OFF OF YOUR ASS AND GET YOUR OWN RICE?
258,00:15:21.23,00:15:21.23,>> I WOULD NEVER DO THIS IN MY REAL LIFE.
259,00:15:23.53,00:15:23.53,I DON'T EVEN WAIT ON MY HUSBAND. >> I'M SPEECHLESS.
260,00:15:26.20,00:15:26.20,>> WITH SHAMAR YOU CAN MAKE IT THIS DEEP DARK STORY ABOUT THE
261,00:15:29.73,00:15:29.73,IRAQ VETERAN AS MUCH AS YOU WANT BUT THAT'S NOT IT.
262,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,"I THINK SHAMAR IS STARVING BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
263,00:15:36.43,00:15:36.43,WE'RE ALL STARVING. SHAMAR IS A BIG BABY WHEN IT
264,00:15:39.63,00:15:39.63,COMES DOWN TO IT. >> (MOANING)
265,00:15:44.33,00:15:44.33,>> WHAT'S GOING ON? >> I SCRATCHED MY EYEBALL.
266,00:15:47.60,00:15:47.60,>> YOU SCRATCHED YOUR EYEBALL? >> UH-HUH.
267,00:15:49.67,00:15:49.67,>> THAT SUCKS. WITH SHAMAR IT'S ALWAYS
268,00:15:52.97,00:15:52.97,"SOMETHING, YOU KNOW? NOW HE'S LAYING IN THE SHELTER"
269,00:15:55.77,00:15:55.77,AND I GUESS A PIECE OF SAND FALLS IN HIS EYE AND HE
270,00:15:58.50,00:15:58.50,SCRATCHES IT SO NOW HIS EYE HURTS.
271,00:16:01.27,00:16:01.27,>> I'M DONE WITH ALL OF THE DRAMA.
272,00:16:03.33,00:16:03.33,>> I KNOW. >> IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
273,00:16:05.23,00:16:05.23,THAT DISTRACTION? WE WOULD BE WINNING.
274,00:16:08.27,00:16:08.27,>> I THINK SHAMAR IS GOING TO LOSE IT SOON.
275,00:16:10.53,00:16:10.53,I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE WOUND UP QUITTING AGAIN.
276,00:16:12.97,00:16:12.97,>> I WAS HOPING TO PUT THIS SHAMAR VOTE OFF FOR AS LONG AS
277,00:16:16.00,00:16:16.00,"POSSIBLE. >> ME, TOO."
278,00:16:16.93,00:16:16.93,>> NOW EVERYBODY'S GETTING PISSED OFF AND STARTING TO
279,00:16:19.60,00:16:19.60,"REALIZE HE HAS TO GO, WHICH IS GREAT FOR ME AND REYNOLD."
280,00:17:01.47,00:17:01.47,>> LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS. >> DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO
281,00:17:05.30,00:17:05.30,RAIN? >> YUP.
282,00:17:07.00,00:17:07.00,">> WE HAD A CRAPPY NIGHT, NEVER FELT WINDS LIKE THAT."
283,00:17:09.43,00:17:09.43,RATS WERE CRAWLING ON US. WE HAVE CUTS AND SCRAPES AND
284,00:17:13.57,00:17:13.57,"BRUISES, WE'RE HUNGRY. IT'S A HARD GAME AND NOW IT'S"
285,00:17:16.40,00:17:16.40,EVEN HARDER BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT SHAMAR IS GOING TO QUIT.
286,00:17:25.27,00:17:25.27,SHAMAR IS SITTING THERE ROCKING BACK AND FORTH.
287,00:17:27.37,00:17:27.37,I THINK HE'S MEDICATING. IT'S LIKE HE CAN'T GET TO A
288,00:17:30.87,00:17:30.87,"HAPPY PLACE. I'M LIKE WHO CAN AROUND HERE,"
289,00:17:33.90,00:17:33.90,YOU KNOW? >> THE FRIGGING GUY DOESN'T WANT
290,00:17:41.67,00:17:41.67,TO BE HERE. >> HIS EYE IS PUFFY.
291,00:17:43.87,00:17:43.87,">> I'M SORRY, MAN, EVERYONE'S DINGED UP."

295,00:18:01.23,00:18:01.23,SLEEP AT NIGHT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT.
296,00:18:05.80,00:18:05.80,"I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GAME, I JUST KIND OF WANT MY EYE FIXED"
297,00:18:09.50,00:18:09.50,"A LITTLE BIT. >> HERE COMES JEFF, GUYS."

306,00:18:48.87,00:18:48.87,YOU JUST TALK TO ME. SO THE WHOLE EYE JUST LOOKS VERY
307,00:18:52.23,00:18:52.23,"RED AT THE MOMENT, SHAMAR. I KNOW THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE."
308,00:18:57.03,00:18:57.03,I'M GOING TO CLOSE IT AGAIN. WHAT I NEED TO RULE OUT IS THAT
309,00:18:59.60,00:18:59.60,HE HADN'T GOTTEN A ABRASION OR ABNORMALITY ON HIS CORNEA WHICH
310,00:19:03.20,00:19:03.20,IS THE CLEAR PART THAT COVERS HIS EYE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
311,00:19:06.33,00:19:06.33,IS PUT IN AN ORANGE DYE AND I'M ABLE TO SEE THING MRS. CLEARLY.
312,00:19:09.77,00:19:09.77,>> Jeff: OKAY. >> Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN AN
313,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,EVENTFUL JOURNEY FOR YOU. YOU'VE HAD SOME LOWS WHERE

318,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,>> IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THERE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A DIVOT IN
319,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,HIS CORNEA. IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO HIS PUPIL OR
320,00:19:45.40,00:19:45.40,ON THE COLORED PART OF HIS EYE. IT COULD AFFECT HIS VISION.
321,00:19:48.73,00:19:48.73,>> THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO OUT
322,00:19:52.13,00:19:52.13,HERE? >> UNFORTUNATELY NOT.
323,00:19:54.47,00:19:54.47,I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD LIKE TO PULL YOU FROM THE
324,00:19:57.70,00:19:57.70,GAME TO HAVE THIS LOOKED INTO BY A SPECIALIST.
325,00:20:03.40,00:20:03.40,">> Jeff: HOW'S THAT LANDING WITH YOU, SHAMAR?"
326,00:20:05.97,00:20:05.97,>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. >> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL IN SOME

328,00:20:12.80,00:20:12.80,TRIBE DOWN? BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING NOT ONLY
329,00:20:15.90,00:20:15.90,A BIG FORCE IN CHALLENGES BUT A NUMBER IN A GAME ABOUT NUMBERS.

337,00:20:47.43,00:20:47.43,ASSESSMENT AND HIS EYE IS IN PRETTY ROUGH SHAPE.
338,00:20:49.60,00:20:49.60,HE'S GOT TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE GAME.

353,00:21:41.47,00:21:41.47,THINKING HE EMOTIONALLY DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE.
354,00:21:43.53,00:21:43.53,IT TURNS OUT IT WAS VERY SERIOUS SO THAT'S MY MISTAKE.
355,00:21:47.97,00:21:47.97,"STILL, HE WAS DISRESPECTFUL, LAZY AND I'M JUST HAPPY HE'S"

545,00:33:51.20,00:33:51.20,WHAT I'M THINKING. >> YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
546,00:33:54.70,00:33:54.70,"DANGEROUS KEEPING REYNOLD AND -- >> HERE'S THE DEAL, IF IT WASN'T"
547,00:33:57.00,00:33:57.00,FOR THOSE TWO GUYS WE WOULDN'T WIN ANY CHALLENGES.
548,00:34:00.07,00:34:00.07,>> WE HAVEN'T WON ANY CHALLENGES YET.
549,00:34:01.80,00:34:01.80,>> WE DID WIN ONE AND IT WAS BECAUSE REYNOLD WAS A BAD ASS.
550,00:34:05.47,00:34:05.47,>> WHEN LAURA'S NAME GOT BROUGHT UP I WAS NOT ON BOARD WITH IT AT
551,00:34:09.60,00:34:09.60,"ALL. FIRST WE LOST SHAMAR, NOW THIS."
552,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,IT FEELS LIKE THE ALLIANCE IS FALLING APART.
553,00:34:16.10,00:34:16.10,"ALSO, IF THEY KEEP SAYING THEY'RE PICKING OFF THE WEAK AND"
554,00:34:18.33,00:34:18.33,"NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG, WELL, OF COURSE THE GUYS ARE"
555,00:34:20.73,00:34:20.73,GOING TO BE ALWAYS STRONGER THAN THE WOMEN.
556,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33,SO OF COURSE THAT CONCERNS ME. MATT THINKS WE NEED TO VOTE
557,00:34:26.20,00:34:26.20,LAURA OUT. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
558,00:34:28.20,00:34:28.20,>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT US BEING THE LAST TWO GIRLS.
559,00:34:30.77,00:34:30.77,THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT STUFF. >> ARE YOU STILL WITH OUR FIVE
560,00:34:36.03,00:34:36.03,RIGHT NOW. >> I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED
561,00:34:38.00,00:34:38.00,"WITH THAT IDOL. I MEAN, IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS"
562,00:34:40.93,00:34:40.93,"BOYS EDDIE, GIRLS REYNOLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT."
563,00:34:43.53,00:34:43.53,>> THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. >> TONIGHT I HAVE TO EITHER KEEP
564,00:34:48.90,00:34:48.90,THE TRIBE STRONG SO THAT WE CAN WIN CHALLENGES OR HOLD ON TO MY
565,00:34:54.23,00:34:54.23,ALLIANCE AND KEEP THAT STRONG AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT
566,00:34:57.07,00:34:57.07,THE RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER IS GOING TO BE.
567,00:34:59.57,00:34:59.57,SO JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH MY GUT AND HOPE IT WORKS OUT.
568,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,">> Jeff: SO, MATT, TELL ME ABOUT THIS TRIBE NOW THAT SHAMAR"
569,00:35:30.07,00:35:30.07,IS GONE. HOW DOES THIS HURT THE TRIBE OR
570,00:35:32.33,00:35:32.33,"HOW DOES IT HELP THE TRIBE? >> YOU KNOW, NOW THAT SHAMAR IS"
571,00:35:35.70,00:35:35.70,GONE I THINK THERE'S LESS TENSION AROUND CAMP HOWEVER WE
572,00:35:44.20,00:35:44.20,LOST A BIG GUY GOOD TO HELPOUS OUT IN CHALLENGES AND IT'S OUR
573,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,THIRD TRIBAL IN THE ROW SO IT SUCKS TO HAVE SHAMAR GONE.
574,00:35:50.10,00:35:50.10,">> Jeff: SHERRI, DO YOU MISS SHAMAR OR IS IT A BIT OF A"
575,00:35:54.60,00:35:54.60,RELIEF? >> I WOULD SAY I MISS SHAMAR AS
576,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,"FAR AS PART OF THE ALLIANCE. >> Jeff: WOW, A VERY SLOW"
577,00:36:04.10,00:36:04.10,THOUGHTFUL ANSWER. >> RIGHT.
578,00:36:06.07,00:36:06.07,">> Jeff: REYNOLD,  WHERE IS THIS TRIBE NOW?"
579,00:36:08.27,00:36:08.27,>> I OBVIOUSLY HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE TRIBE THE FIRST TWO
580,00:36:11.40,00:36:11.40,TRIBAL COUNCILS. I THOUGHT GETTING SHAMAR OUT
581,00:36:16.33,00:36:16.33,FIRST WE COULD HAVE STARTED TO GEL BUT THERE'S A STRONG
582,00:36:19.37,00:36:19.37,ALLIANCE OF FIVE HERE AND THEY'RE VERY HESITANT TO BREAK
583,00:36:21.47,00:36:21.47,IT UP. YET WITHOUT EDDIE AND I YOUR
584,00:36:24.37,00:36:24.37,CHANCES OF WINNING ANY MORE CHALLENGES ARE VERY SLIM.
585,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,">> Jeff: LAURA, REYNOLD MAKES A GOOD ARGUMENT."
586,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,THE TWO GUYS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ALLIANCE ARE TWO OF THE
587,00:36:33.60,00:36:33.60,STRONGEST GUYS IN THE CHALLENGES.
588,00:36:34.73,00:36:34.73,">> SURE, BUT, YOU KNOW, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS DEFINITELY"
589,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,BASED ON WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OR
590,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43,OUR LOYALTIES AND OUR ALLIANCES AND WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO IS
591,00:36:44.50,00:36:44.50,GOING TO GET US FURTHER IN THIS GAME.
592,00:36:46.80,00:36:46.80,>> Jeff: AND WHAT'S YOUR CASE? IF YOU HEARD SOMEBODY WHISPERING
593,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83,"SAYING ""LAURA KILLED US AGAIN, LET'S VOTE LAURA OUT --""."
594,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,>> THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH VOTES TEND TO HAPPEN VERY EARLY ON IN
595,00:36:58.30,00:36:58.30,THE GAME BEFORE RELATIONSHIPS ARE FORMED.
596,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,WE HAVE HAD TEN DAYS TO BUILD TRUST AND THAT'S HUGE AT THIS

601,00:37:15.23,00:37:15.23,LOSING. ARE YOU PRIORITIZING WINNING OR
602,00:37:17.00,00:37:17.00,"ARE YOU PRIORITIZING LOSING? >> Jeff: SHERRI, REYNOLD TODAY"
603,00:37:22.20,00:37:22.20,ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY BROUGHT YOU GUYS BACK.
604,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,>> BUT WE'RE STILL LOSING. EVEN WITH THEM.
605,00:37:26.60,00:37:26.60,WE'RE STILL LOSING. >> Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
606,00:37:29.37,00:37:29.37,"KEEPING REYNOLD, KEEPING EDDIE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO"
607,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,"CHANGE ANYTHING, ALL IT WILL DO IS BREAK OUR ALLIANCE."
608,00:37:34.63,00:37:34.63,">> EXACTLY. >> Jeff: EDDIE, YOU'VE BEEN ON"
609,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,THE BOTTOM FROM THE GET-GO. >> YEAH.
610,00:37:39.30,00:37:39.30,"IN THAT ASPECT, ME AND REYNOLD ARE FIGHTING WITH OUR BACKS"
611,00:37:42.13,00:37:42.13,AGAINST THE WALL. IF WE COME TOGETHER NOW AND GET
612,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,RID OF OUR WEAKEST PLAYER AND GO FORWARD AND START WINNING WE
613,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK HERE. >> Jeff: WOULD YOU PUT CHERNY
614,00:37:50.23,00:37:50.23,THE CATEGORY OF ONE OF THE WEAKER PLAYERS?
615,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,>> YEAH. >> Jeff: HOW ABOUT JULIA?
616,00:37:54.73,00:37:54.73,>> JULIA IS ONE OF THE STRONGER GIRLS SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.
617,00:37:58.43,00:37:58.43,>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT LAURA? >> LAURA UNFORTUNATELY IS THE
618,00:38:01.77,00:38:01.77,WEAKEST PLAYER WE HAVE ON OUR TEAM.
619,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,"I'M NOT GOING TO LIE ABOUT IT. >> Jeff: HARD TO HEAR, LAURA?"
620,00:38:06.43,00:38:06.43,">> IT IS HARD TO HEAR, BUT WE ALL KNOW THIS GAME PRETTY WELL."
621,00:38:09.60,00:38:09.60,THERE ARE CERTAIN TWISTS TO IT AND IF NUMBERS WERE JUMBLED OVER
622,00:38:13.80,00:38:13.80,THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE ALL ENDED UP ON DIFFERENT TRIBES
623,00:38:17.40,00:38:17.40,IT'S LIKE PREDICTING THE FUTURE. ARE EDDIE AND REYNOLD GOING TO
624,00:38:20.67,00:38:20.67,BE AS LOYAL AS OUR ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW?
625,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE WILLING TO JUMP SHIP?
626,00:38:27.47,00:38:27.47,">> Jeff: SO EDDIE, REALLY, THE THIRD FACTOR IN THIS, LOYALTY"
627,00:38:31.57,00:38:31.57,"VERSUS STRENGTH, IS PREDICTING THE FUTURE."

632,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,I THINK TONIGHT IS THE MAKE OR BREAK FACTOR FOR THIS TRIBE.
