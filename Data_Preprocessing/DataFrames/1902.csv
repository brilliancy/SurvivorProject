150,00:09:01.25,00:09:01.25,I seen it sitting there.So I reached up there and

152,00:09:09.04,00:09:09.04,around and just walked off.The wonderful immunity idol.

157,00:09:31.12,00:09:31.12,>> Keep it cool.>> And then everybody's
158,00:09:33.58,00:09:33.58,standing right there!>> I know.
159,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,"How did you get it out of there,put it in your pants?"
160,00:09:38.21,00:09:38.21,">> Boo-ya.>> Russell found the idol, so"
161,00:09:40.04,00:09:40.04,I'm excited we have it.I think it's definitely a tool
162,00:09:42.04,00:09:42.04,we can use.>> Let me put it on before...
163,00:09:43.67,00:09:43.67,">> So ""this is yours.It can't be taken from you."""
164,00:09:46.17,00:09:46.17,I'm not sure how I feel aboutthe fact that he has control of
165,00:09:48.21,00:09:48.21,"it as opposed to me, but atthis point, I think I can trust"
166,00:09:51.54,00:09:51.54,Russell a lot more.You and I have still a deal?
167,00:09:54.75,00:09:54.75,">> Hell, yeah, dude, it's on.I wouldn't have never told you"
168,00:09:57.17,00:09:57.17,if it wouldn't have been.I ain't stupid. So it's on.

170,00:10:01.88,00:10:01.88,>> Okay.>> We'll deal with that later.
171,00:10:04.00,00:10:04.00,My strategy from the beginningwas if I found the immunity
172,00:10:06.96,00:10:06.96,"idol I wouldn't tell anybody,but I wanted Jaison to trust"
173,00:10:10.25,00:10:10.25,"me, so I showed him I had itand said, ""You see."
174,00:10:14.00,00:10:14.00,"You can trust me.""I don't have plans to give it"
175,00:10:17.38,00:10:17.38,to him.I just want him to think that I
176,00:10:19.67,00:10:19.67,will if he needs it.How does it look on me?

376,00:21:57.50,00:21:57.50,what this means.Foa Foa is now down to eight

383,00:22:14.46,00:22:14.46,And I think she absolutely madethe right decision.
384,00:22:18.67,00:22:18.67,"With Mike gone, Marisa gone,and then a Tribal Council..."
385,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"(sighs)You know, I'd like to say we can"
386,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,"push through this, but it doesnot bode well for us."
387,00:22:44.83,00:22:44.83,">> Did Shambo take the fins,too?"

389,00:22:49.04,00:22:49.04,>> I'd love her to come backwith fish.
390,00:22:51.04,00:22:51.04,"Oh, she's way down there.>> Shambo insisted that"
391,00:22:54.04,00:22:54.04,spearfishing was her thing.Awesome.

395,00:23:06.46,00:23:06.46,fish.>> This is the first bath I've
396,00:23:11.54,00:23:11.54,"had in five days, even if it isa swamp."
397,00:23:14.08,00:23:14.08,"It feels awesome.I didn't catch any fish, but I"
398,00:23:16.79,00:23:16.79,tried.And there's no visibility in
399,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,"this pond water, so I can't usethe mask and the spear."

408,00:23:44.75,00:23:44.75,the swamp.I wasn't using the mouthpiece.
409,00:23:46.50,00:23:46.50,I was using this... the mask.>> Okay.
410,00:23:48.50,00:23:48.50,>> Just floated off.>> So the mouthpiece is gone?

415,00:24:03.71,00:24:03.71,>> The good news is-- you'llnever believe it-- there's fish
416,00:24:08.21,00:24:08.21,"in the ocean.You know, I feel sorry for her,"
417,00:24:12.54,00:24:12.54,"in one sense, because she's kindof desperate right now, trying"
418,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,"to catch fish, and then on topof not catching the fish, she"
419,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,loses our stuff.You just signed your own death
420,00:24:21.88,00:24:21.88,warrant is basically what youdid.
421,00:24:23.88,00:24:23.88,">> I mean, if everybody wouldcome closer, I'd like to"

430,00:24:49.08,00:24:49.08,"matched up with the rightpeople, because then it's like"
431,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,taking candy from a baby.Who the hell wants to do that?
432,00:24:53.38,00:24:53.38,That don't boost my self-esteem.You know what I'm saying?

462,00:26:28.71,00:26:28.71,"Too many, so you know....>> Sure."

470,00:26:47.38,00:26:47.38,It wasn't anything personal.You were going after one of my
471,00:26:49.38,00:26:49.38,teammates...>> But you a dude.
472,00:26:51.38,00:26:51.38,Look at the match-up.Do you see women playing
473,00:26:53.38,00:26:53.38,football with men that playfootball?
474,00:26:55.38,00:26:55.38,>> That's because they can't.>> It's either all women...

483,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,"It doesn't matter.Yes, it is a game."
484,00:27:13.67,00:27:13.67,">> Listen, Grammar School.Listen, here's where it's..."
485,00:27:15.67,00:27:15.67,"here's where it's going, allright?"

487,00:27:19.21,00:27:19.21,>> Ignorant? What's thedefinition of ignorant?
488,00:27:21.21,00:27:21.21,">> Yeah, yeah. What's thedefinition of grammar school?"
489,00:27:22.62,00:27:22.62,I'm just telling you how I feel.But since I see I won't get

492,00:27:27.12,00:27:27.12,appreciate you tackling me.>> You won't get anywhere with
493,00:27:28.96,00:27:28.96,"me, not... no way.Yasmin is just a piece of work."
494,00:27:31.38,00:27:31.38,Yasmin has a big mouth.Yasmin smells bad.
495,00:27:34.50,00:27:34.50,She's got really poor grammar.I think Yasmin is pretty close
496,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,to being a hooker.>> You the one look like a fool.
497,00:27:43.38,00:27:43.38,You look like a big jerk goingafter a girl.
498,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"Okay, if a dude saw that on TV,they wouldn't say, ""Ooh, he"
499,00:27:47.62,00:27:47.62,"tackled a girl; he's the bomb.""They'd be, like, ""You know what?"
500,00:27:49.88,00:27:49.88,"He's a big sissy.""That's what they would say."
501,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,">> I say, ""Kill 'em all.""I say, ""Kill 'em all."""
502,00:27:53.88,00:27:53.88,">> That's what they would say,but you heard what I said."
503,00:27:55.88,00:27:55.88,">> Yeah, I heard your incorrectgrammar the whole time."
504,00:27:57.88,00:27:57.88,>> Uh-huh.>> She was just barking up the
505,00:27:59.88,00:27:59.88,"wrong tree, 'cause I'm the oneperson that you just don't want"
506,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"to approach like that.>> And I see, you know what?"
507,00:28:03.96,00:28:03.96,>> You don't even know thedefinition of ignorant.
508,00:28:06.79,00:28:06.79,>> You're looking for a fightbecause you're ignorant.

512,00:28:13.71,00:28:13.71,You're in our camp.>> Ben is definitely a wild
513,00:28:15.50,00:28:15.50,card.He's definitely a liability.
514,00:28:17.50,00:28:17.50,He's saying things atchallenges.
515,00:28:19.38,00:28:19.38,He's getting kicked out ofchallenges.
516,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"Um, honestly, I think what Ben'sdoing is stupid on his part."
517,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,">> She's ghetto trash, plainand simple."
518,00:28:28.58,00:28:28.58,>> That's right.>> She needs to go back to
519,00:28:31.12,00:28:31.12,eating ketchup sandwiches anddrinking Kool-Aid and doing
520,00:28:33.67,00:28:33.67,whatever the hell she does andleave me alone.
521,00:28:36.08,00:28:36.08,>> You know what?I wish Yasmin was here for
522,00:28:38.54,00:28:38.54,another three days 'cause I loveconfrontation.
523,00:28:42.04,00:28:42.04,'Cause her and Ben startfighting.
524,00:28:44.58,00:28:44.58,Everybody starts hearing it.I love that.
525,00:28:47.21,00:28:47.21,That just makes everybody notlike Ben.
526,00:28:49.38,00:28:49.38,"You know, I got some greatplans set ahead, and, uh, it's"
527,00:28:52.50,00:28:52.50,going to be real fun.(scraping)
528,00:29:35.96,00:29:35.96,">> What do you think?(animal hooting, birds singing)"
529,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,">> Um, I don't know what'sgoing on, but Ben was up all"
530,00:30:16.38,00:30:16.38,night.I think he's asking to be thrown
531,00:30:18.71,00:30:18.71,out.It was so ridiculous.
532,00:30:22.50,00:30:22.50,It was so crazy.Why would you hammer a machete
533,00:30:26.79,00:30:26.79,in the middle of the night?With a fire going.
534,00:30:29.04,00:30:29.04,There's no reason.So I don't think anybody's too
535,00:30:34.46,00:30:34.46,happy.>> I was getting really annoyed
536,00:30:38.00,00:30:38.00,"by the guy, and it's reallystarting to drive me crazy."

538,00:30:42.12,00:30:42.12,"anything, or he getsexasperated, he really just"
539,00:30:44.92,00:30:44.92,"unleashes, instead of just beinglike, ""Hey, man we need to talk"
540,00:30:48.25,00:30:48.25,"about this."">> Who the hell hammers in the"
541,00:31:03.29,00:31:03.29,middle of the night?At nothing.

550,00:31:33.71,00:31:33.71,"got kicked out of a challenge.So, I would have voted for him."
551,00:31:36.08,00:31:36.08,"Even if it didn't happen lastnight and all that, I was going"
552,00:31:38.08,00:31:38.08,to vote for him anyway.I was going to tell you I was
