1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,Survivor: these 20 castaways were marooned on the tiny
3,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67,island nation of Samoa. You guys have already been
4,00:00:10.71,00:00:10.71,"divided into two tribes. Wearing purple, you are Galu;"
5,00:00:13.67,00:00:13.67,"wearing yellow, you're Foa Foa. At their camp, Galu had a"
6,00:00:19.12,00:00:19.12,communications breakdown. >> We have strong male
7,00:00:22.17,00:00:22.17,personalities that aren't really hearing one another.
8,00:00:27.54,00:00:27.54,>> PROBST: but Galu's problems were minor compared to Foa
9,00:00:30.25,00:00:30.25,Foa's. The yellow tribe's biggest
10,00:00:33.58,00:00:33.58,problem is spelled R-U-S-S-E-L-L.
11,00:00:37.92,00:00:37.92,"Russell's plan is to perpetrate every dirty trick in the book,"
12,00:00:41.54,00:00:41.54,in order to win. >> They can be my little
13,00:00:43.83,00:00:43.83,"puppets. When I'm finished with them,"
14,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,just throw them in the trash. >> PROBST: On their first
15,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,"night, he sabotaged his own camp just to make life miserable for"
16,00:00:51.17,00:00:51.17,the others. >> I think if I can control how
17,00:00:53.83,00:00:53.83,"they feel, I can control how they think."
18,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,>> PROBST: He made a series secret alliances.
19,00:00:58.83,00:00:58.83,">> I got an alliance with the dumb short-haired blonde, and an"
20,00:01:01.21,00:01:01.21,even dumber long-haired blonde. And the dark-haired girl.
21,00:01:05.04,00:01:05.04,I like to call it my dumb-ass girl alliance.
22,00:01:07.21,00:01:07.21,>> PROBST: He constantly lied. >> I lived in New Orleans.
23,00:01:10.88,00:01:10.88,"The storm was a category 5. When it hit, I tried to get out"
24,00:01:14.17,00:01:14.17,of the house and I realized I wasn't going to make it.
25,00:01:16.25,00:01:16.25,I never lived in New Orleans. It's crazy how you can break
26,00:01:19.96,00:01:19.96,their hearts by telling them a lie.
27,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,">> PROBST: after Foa Foa lost the immunity challenge, Russell"
28,00:01:25.67,00:01:25.67,"needed a fall guy, so when Marisa became suspicious of"
29,00:01:28.92,00:01:28.92,him... >> I'm starting to feel like
30,00:01:30.79,00:01:30.79,he's pretty slimy. >> PROBST: He found his
31,00:01:32.25,00:01:32.25,sacrificial lamb. >> What is that going to make
32,00:01:34.25,00:01:34.25,me think? That makes me think I gotta get
33,00:01:36.17,00:01:36.17,rid of her. >> Vote Marisa.
34,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,>> We're voting off Marisa. >> PROBST: But not everybody was
35,00:01:40.12,00:01:40.12,on board with his scheme. >> Marisa.
36,00:01:42.25,00:01:42.25,>> No. >> She's going first.
37,00:01:44.88,00:01:44.88,"If you stay with me, then you're going to be fine for a"
38,00:01:47.25,00:01:47.25,long time. >> PROBST: Unfortunately for
39,00:01:49.25,00:01:49.25,"Russell, Betsy's a cop and she didn't believe a word he said."
40,00:01:52.21,00:01:52.21,">> As a police officer, I usually can get a pretty good"
41,00:01:54.79,00:01:54.79,read on somebody. And I don't trust Russell.
42,00:01:59.21,00:01:59.21,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Betsy went against Russell"
43,00:02:02.21,00:02:02.21,and targeted Ashley as the weakest player.
44,00:02:04.92,00:02:04.92,>> I think Ashley's the weakest. >> PROBST: But Russell's sway
45,00:02:08.25,00:02:08.25,over the others was too strong. First person voted out of
46,00:02:11.04,00:02:11.04,"Survivor: Samoa, Marisa. Marisa was out, leaving Officer"
47,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,Betsy to return to camp to figure out where Russell will
48,00:02:18.04,00:02:18.04,strike next. 19 are left.
49,00:02:22.00,00:02:22.00,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Tribal Council was-- I
50,00:02:43.21,00:02:43.21,liked it. I had fun because Marisa's gone
51,00:02:46.88,00:02:46.88,"for no other reason but me, and that's a fact."
52,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,"If you play with fire, you're going to get burned, and she"
53,00:02:53.17,00:02:53.17,got burned. I'm excited that Marisa is gone.
54,00:02:55.96,00:02:55.96,"You know, I don't have to worry about it no more."
55,00:02:57.96,00:02:57.96,I don't have to worry about her strong mind.
56,00:02:59.83,00:02:59.83,I know that she's a strong woman.
57,00:03:01.50,00:03:01.50,(screeching) You can't have that out here.
58,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,"I can't have it. >> You see, the thing is, I..."
59,00:03:13.17,00:03:13.17,I was telling you... I didn't do anything for you
60,00:03:16.04,00:03:16.04,"not to trust me, nothing. You was going by appearance"
61,00:03:18.79,00:03:18.79,"only, I guess. Or how I was trying to play the"
62,00:03:21.62,00:03:21.62,game so fast. Which I understand.
63,00:03:24.62,00:03:24.62,"But I-I mean it, and I even told the people I was with that I"
64,00:03:29.25,00:03:29.25,want to keep you around as long as I possibly can.
65,00:03:33.08,00:03:33.08,"I think you made a huge mistake, and you'll see that"
66,00:03:35.88,00:03:35.88,later on. >> Okay.
67,00:03:37.79,00:03:37.79,">> Because I was... >> All right, as long as we"
68,00:03:39.62,00:03:39.62,"agree that we don't trust each other, but we still can talk."
69,00:03:42.67,00:03:42.67,>> Yeah. >> All right.
70,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,>> I just don't... You didn't... Why didn't you trust me from
71,00:03:47.50,00:03:47.50,the beginning? You're not a threat to me.
72,00:03:50.17,00:03:50.17,It would be a perfect thing for me to do.
73,00:03:52.75,00:03:52.75,"But, anyway... >> Okay."
74,00:03:54.58,00:03:54.58,>> It is what it is. >> It is what it is.
75,00:03:57.54,00:03:57.54,(laughs) I feel fine that I
76,00:04:00.12,00:04:00.12,voted for Ashley last night. I have no regrets.
77,00:04:02.58,00:04:02.58,But I think Russ felt very threatened by Marisa.
78,00:04:05.17,00:04:05.17,"He didn't like her. She spoke her mind, but I'm not"
79,00:04:08.96,00:04:08.96,afraid to stand up to him at all.
80,00:04:10.96,00:04:10.96,He knows where I'm coming from. He knows that I have no faith
81,00:04:14.79,00:04:14.79,"in him, and I used to. But not after getting to know"
82,00:04:17.75,00:04:17.75,him. (theme song playing)
83,00:04:52.54,00:04:52.54,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Look at all the rashes.
84,00:05:39.54,00:05:39.54,"They ate me up. See, you even still look nice."
85,00:05:42.96,00:05:42.96,What's wrong with me? Why do I look this bad?
86,00:05:45.54,00:05:45.54,">> Because you're funky, baby. >> Oh, whatever."
87,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,"Funky is the word. Oh, my God."
88,00:05:48.96,00:05:48.96,I'm never taking my kids camping.
89,00:05:50.71,00:05:50.71,"This is crap. I don't know who invented,"
90,00:05:52.79,00:05:52.79,"like, loving the outdoors. Like, who can really love the"
91,00:05:54.67,00:05:54.67,"outdoors when you can be indoors, 'cause this right here?"
92,00:05:57.25,00:05:57.25,"This is not for me. >> Her back's all wet, poor"
93,00:05:59.29,00:05:59.29,"girl. >> And then see, look at how I"
94,00:06:01.58,00:06:01.58,"have to walk, like a stick up my butt."
95,00:06:03.29,00:06:03.29,"Last night was horrible. Lord have, mercy, God, I didn't"
96,00:06:06.33,00:06:06.33,know it was going to be this hard.
97,00:06:09.67,00:06:09.67,"I was shaking, I was cold, I was nauseated."
98,00:06:12.62,00:06:12.62,I don't know what was happening. All I know is it was not good.
99,00:06:17.17,00:06:17.17,Look at that bed. That bed is pitiful.
100,00:06:19.08,00:06:19.08,"I've been told so many times, ""Oh, if you can make it in"
101,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00,"Detroit, you can make it anywhere."""
102,00:06:24.83,00:06:24.83,"What, the 'hood? The 'hood is not the woods."
103,00:06:27.08,00:06:27.08,Ugh! >> Yeah! I got a lizard!
104,00:06:36.12,00:06:36.12,"Look, I got him right on the dome, too, man."
105,00:06:37.75,00:06:37.75,">> Oh, what's up. >> Stick a stick down his face"
106,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,"and roast him up. >> All right, I just want to"
107,00:06:47.54,00:06:47.54,make sure everything is good. Last night was a little too
108,00:06:49.54,00:06:49.54,chaotic for me. And I was a little shocked by
109,00:06:51.62,00:06:51.62,how aggressive you guys were with Marisa last night.
110,00:06:53.96,00:06:53.96,"I didn't know that either hatred ran that deep, or that"
111,00:06:57.00,00:06:57.00,"you and Ben were that close. >> Oh, that's not it."
112,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,It ain't nothing to do with hatred.
113,00:07:01.42,00:07:01.42,It's just she was... I thought she would be a real
114,00:07:05.08,00:07:05.08,powerful player. Me and Ben was talking
115,00:07:07.46,00:07:07.46,"about that. I think, man, I trust you way"
116,00:07:09.96,00:07:09.96,more than Ben. >> Do you?
117,00:07:13.67,00:07:13.67,">> I think Jaison is somebody perfect to bring with you,"
118,00:07:17.62,00:07:17.62,because he's so calm and collected.
119,00:07:20.12,00:07:20.12,"He's an honest guy. He's playing the game, playing"
120,00:07:22.75,00:07:22.75,"the challenges hard. He's quiet, but he's likable."
121,00:07:26.00,00:07:26.00,You can't do this alone. You gotta have somebody.
122,00:07:29.29,00:07:29.29,"So if Jaison is the person that I can trust, then this is going"
123,00:07:32.83,00:07:32.83,"to be real good. Another thing, man, I think"
124,00:07:36.88,00:07:36.88,there's an immunity idol in our camp.
125,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,"You gotta keep that a secret. You know, and I should keep it"
126,00:07:42.67,00:07:42.67,"a secret, but the reason I'm telling you is 'cause I trust"
127,00:07:45.12,00:07:45.12,"you, 'cause I'm going to start looking for it."
128,00:07:47.42,00:07:47.42,"'Cause if we can find that, dude, without even any clues..."
129,00:07:50.54,00:07:50.54,>> Yeah. >> That would be wonderful.
130,00:07:57.33,00:07:57.33,>> Russell really wants to find this hidden immunity idol.
131,00:08:00.92,00:08:00.92,We don't even know if there is an immunity idol that's hidden
132,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,or going to come into existence or whatever.
133,00:08:07.67,00:08:07.67,"So, he's kind of, I guess, trying to launch a preemptive"
134,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,strike on trying to figure out where that thing would be.
135,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,>> Don't put anything green in this fire.
136,00:08:15.21,00:08:15.21,">> if I can find that idol, then that would be genius."
137,00:08:18.96,00:08:18.96,"In the history of Survivor, how many people found the idol"
138,00:08:22.50,00:08:22.50,without a clue? Zero.
139,00:08:29.92,00:08:29.92,">> I think you'll like this, Mick."
140,00:08:32.08,00:08:32.08,">> Yeah, I'm excited. >> Pretty tasty."
141,00:08:34.17,00:08:34.17,>> It's a white meat. >> Uh-huh.
142,00:08:36.46,00:08:36.46,>> I cannot believe I'm eating lizard.
143,00:08:38.08,00:08:38.08,"Oh, my God. >> It kind of tastes like"
144,00:08:40.21,00:08:40.21,chicken/fish. >> What's he doing in there?
145,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> I'm looking. I'm looking for the immunity
146,00:08:43.88,00:08:43.88,idol. These people are so ignorant.
147,00:08:48.96,00:08:48.96,Everybody is standing in the same spot.
148,00:08:51.38,00:08:51.38,I'm in a big old hole in the tree and I don't want to look
149,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67,"suspicious but it surely does. So I look in the tree, I look"
150,00:08:57.00,00:08:57.00,up. I almost passed out.
151,00:09:01.25,00:09:01.25,I seen it sitting there. So I reached up there and
152,00:09:05.75,00:09:05.75,"yanked it down, got it loose, put it in my underwear, turned"
153,00:09:09.04,00:09:09.04,around and just walked off. The wonderful immunity idol.
154,00:09:14.21,00:09:14.21,"Boo-yah. >> Guess I'm on now, dude."
155,00:09:18.88,00:09:18.88,>> Ow! Is that it?
156,00:09:25.17,00:09:25.17,">> When I looked up, I almost passed out."
157,00:09:27.92,00:09:27.92,"When I looked up and seen it, I started shaking."
158,00:09:31.12,00:09:31.12,>> Keep it cool. >> And then everybody's
159,00:09:33.58,00:09:33.58,standing right there! >> I know.
160,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,"How did you get it out of there, put it in your pants?"
161,00:09:38.21,00:09:38.21,">> Boo-ya. >> Russell found the idol, so"
162,00:09:40.04,00:09:40.04,I'm excited we have it. I think it's definitely a tool
163,00:09:42.04,00:09:42.04,we can use. >> Let me put it on before...
164,00:09:43.67,00:09:43.67,">> So ""this is yours. It can't be taken from you."""
165,00:09:46.17,00:09:46.17,I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that he has control of
166,00:09:48.21,00:09:48.21,"it as opposed to me, but at this point, I think I can trust"
167,00:09:51.54,00:09:51.54,Russell a lot more. You and I have still a deal?
168,00:09:54.75,00:09:54.75,">> Hell, yeah, dude, it's on. I wouldn't have never told you"
169,00:09:57.17,00:09:57.17,if it wouldn't have been. I ain't stupid. So it's on.
170,00:09:59.96,00:09:59.96,">> Yeah, well let me get back there before..."
171,00:10:01.88,00:10:01.88,>> Okay. >> We'll deal with that later.
172,00:10:04.00,00:10:04.00,My strategy from the beginning was if I found the immunity
173,00:10:06.96,00:10:06.96,"idol I wouldn't tell anybody, but I wanted Jaison to trust"
174,00:10:10.25,00:10:10.25,"me, so I showed him I had it and said, ""You see."
175,00:10:14.00,00:10:14.00,"You can trust me."" I don't have plans to give it"
176,00:10:17.38,00:10:17.38,to him. I just want him to think that I
177,00:10:19.67,00:10:19.67,will if he needs it. How does it look on me?
178,00:10:23.00,00:10:23.00,Pretty? >> Let's go get tree mail.
179,00:10:35.17,00:10:35.17,Come on. >> Me and you?
180,00:10:36.42,00:10:36.42,">> Yes. Okay, Mike, don't doubt"
181,00:10:39.12,00:10:39.12,"yourself. We can do this, right?"
182,00:10:41.50,00:10:41.50,We're not going to give up. >> We got to. We got to.
183,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,"Betsy's paranoid. We're the two older ones, but"
184,00:10:47.58,00:10:47.58,"at Tribal Council, I didn't get one vote but I want to show 'em"
185,00:10:51.54,00:10:51.54,"today that, you know, I'm not the weakest."
186,00:10:55.62,00:10:55.62,"I'm the oldest, but I am definitely not the weakest."

376,00:21:53.33,00:21:53.33,"matter what age I am, you know? >> PROBST: All right, so, here's"
377,00:21:57.50,00:21:57.50,what this means. Foa Foa is now down to eight
378,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,members. You guys are going to head back
379,00:22:02.58,00:22:02.58,to camp with Yasmin. You're still visiting.
380,00:22:04.42,00:22:04.42,You will still go to Tribal Council tomorrow night.
381,00:22:06.58,00:22:06.58,"You guys head back to camp. Borassi, you're going to the"
382,00:22:09.00,00:22:09.00,hospital. >> I was privy to the
383,00:22:11.08,00:22:11.08,conversation that Mike had with the physician there.
384,00:22:14.46,00:22:14.46,And I think she absolutely made the right decision.
385,00:22:18.67,00:22:18.67,"With Mike gone, Marisa gone, and then a Tribal Council..."
386,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"(sighs) You know, I'd like to say we can"
387,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,"push through this, but it does not bode well for us."
388,00:22:44.83,00:22:44.83,">> Did Shambo take the fins, too?"
389,00:22:46.92,00:22:46.92,>> I don't know. >> Where is she?
390,00:22:49.04,00:22:49.04,>> I'd love her to come back with fish.
391,00:22:51.04,00:22:51.04,"Oh, she's way down there. >> Shambo insisted that"
392,00:22:54.04,00:22:54.04,spearfishing was her thing. Awesome.
393,00:22:56.04,00:22:56.04,She's bringing back fish for sure.
394,00:22:59.08,00:22:59.08,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Coco rico in my belly. \xe2\x99\xaa >> Yeah.
395,00:23:03.79,00:23:03.79,>> Shambo's been gone a while. I hope that means she got some
396,00:23:06.46,00:23:06.46,fish. >> This is the first bath I've
397,00:23:11.54,00:23:11.54,"had in five days, even if it is a swamp."
398,00:23:14.08,00:23:14.08,"It feels awesome. I didn't catch any fish, but I"
399,00:23:16.79,00:23:16.79,tried. And there's no visibility in
400,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,"this pond water, so I can't use the mask and the spear."
401,00:23:25.21,00:23:25.21,So I'm going to go Yogi Bear back float around here for a
402,00:23:28.04,00:23:28.04,"little while. Hi, peeps."
403,00:23:32.08,00:23:32.08,>> Hey. >> Hey. How'd it go?
404,00:23:34.12,00:23:34.12,>> You guys want the good news or the bad news?
405,00:23:36.38,00:23:36.38,>> Bad news. >> Bad news?
406,00:23:38.29,00:23:38.29,>> Yeah. >> I had no luck in the ocean.
407,00:23:40.38,00:23:40.38,"I was in the... >> You broke the, uh..."
408,00:23:42.50,00:23:42.50,>> I didn't break it. It floated off while I was in
409,00:23:44.75,00:23:44.75,the swamp. I wasn't using the mouthpiece.
410,00:23:46.50,00:23:46.50,I was using this... the mask. >> Okay.
411,00:23:48.50,00:23:48.50,>> Just floated off. >> So the mouthpiece is gone?
412,00:23:50.79,00:23:50.79,>> It is. >> You couldn't find it?
413,00:23:53.04,00:23:53.04,>> It's in the swamp. There's nothing I can do.
414,00:23:57.08,00:23:57.08,>> And the good news? >> There are hundreds of
415,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,"thousand of fish on the reef, so..."
416,00:24:03.71,00:24:03.71,>> The good news is-- you'll never believe it-- there's fish
417,00:24:08.21,00:24:08.21,"in the ocean. You know, I feel sorry for her,"
418,00:24:12.54,00:24:12.54,"in one sense, because she's kind of desperate right now, trying"
419,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,"to catch fish, and then on top of not catching the fish, she"
420,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,loses our stuff. You just signed your own death
421,00:24:21.88,00:24:21.88,warrant is basically what you did.
422,00:24:23.88,00:24:23.88,">> I mean, if everybody would come closer, I'd like to"
423,00:24:25.96,00:24:25.96,introduce myself. >> Yeah.
424,00:24:28.08,00:24:28.08,>> Tell you guys who I am and find out a little bit about you.
425,00:24:32.21,00:24:32.21,"Okay, now, my name is Yasmin, and I'm a professional hair"
426,00:24:36.29,00:24:36.29,stylist. I don't know how you're feeling
427,00:24:38.29,00:24:38.29,"about me, but let's just say I'm not the enemy."
428,00:24:41.25,00:24:41.25,"Not only that; I'm here to help you guys strategize, because to"
429,00:24:43.29,00:24:43.29,"me, I don't like a not-fair fight."
430,00:24:46.17,00:24:46.17,"It's almost like, why be matched up with people that's not"
431,00:24:49.08,00:24:49.08,"matched up with the right people, because then it's like"
432,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,taking candy from a baby. Who the hell wants to do that?
433,00:24:53.38,00:24:53.38,That don't boost my self-esteem. You know what I'm saying?
434,00:24:56.67,00:24:56.67,That makes me seem like I really did something that was a
435,00:24:58.92,00:24:58.92,"cakewalk, but, um... >> We got Yasmin here, and, uh,"
436,00:25:02.00,00:25:02.00,what-what are her first words to us?
437,00:25:04.04,00:25:04.04,"""I want to help you guys. Why? Because I don't want this to be"
438,00:25:07.96,00:25:07.96,a cakewalk. I don't want this to be like
439,00:25:10.12,00:25:10.12,"taking candy from a baby."" I was, like, ""Screw you."""
440,00:25:14.04,00:25:14.04,">> Now don't get offended, but personally, off the riff, I've"
441,00:25:17.62,00:25:17.62,"noticed that strategy may be, um, something you guys are"
442,00:25:20.96,00:25:20.96,"lacking, and I don't know his name."
443,00:25:23.12,00:25:23.12,What's his name right there? >> Ben.
444,00:25:25.17,00:25:25.17,">> Ben, I would like to talk to you in private about something."
445,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,For sure. I know this is not the game that
446,00:25:29.17,00:25:29.17,people think you can be honest...
447,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,>> She's full of crap. She comes over here to our
448,00:25:33.17,00:25:33.17,"camp, disrespects us, calls us babies, tells us how we can win"
449,00:25:36.38,00:25:36.38,"a challenge if we listen to her. She come to the wrong camp, and"
450,00:25:41.54,00:25:41.54,"she ain't getting nothing but disrespect from me from now on,"
451,00:25:44.04,00:25:44.04,and you know what? She's going to pay for that
452,00:25:46.17,00:25:46.17,"statement, I promise you. >> ""Congratulations."
453,00:25:55.25,00:25:55.25,You now have a clue to the hidden immunity idol.
454,00:25:58.29,00:25:58.29,It's up to you whether you share this information with
455,00:26:00.88,00:26:00.88,"anyone else."" (sighs)"
456,00:26:04.42,00:26:04.42,"""Search hard here at Foa Foa. Your treasure's not easy to see."
457,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,"If you don't find it in a little while, you must be"
458,00:26:13.92,00:26:13.92,"barking up the wrong tree."" Hmm."
459,00:26:16.71,00:26:16.71,"I haven't been here all of two hours yet, so I don't know who"
460,00:26:20.21,00:26:20.21,I can trust. I do care about getting that
461,00:26:22.38,00:26:22.38,"idol, but with that clue and all I had to go on was a tree."
462,00:26:26.38,00:26:26.38,You know how many trees are out here?
463,00:26:28.71,00:26:28.71,"Too many, so you know.... >> Sure."
464,00:26:32.38,00:26:32.38,>> Okay. Now.
465,00:26:34.88,00:26:34.88,>> What's up? >> Let's talk about cheap shots.
466,00:26:36.88,00:26:36.88,I don't know... >> Trippin' somebody ain't a
467,00:26:38.88,00:26:38.88,"cheap shot. >> Uh, uh, uh, uh."
468,00:26:41.38,00:26:41.38,'Cause guess what? You tackled me like a dude.
469,00:26:43.38,00:26:43.38,Don't tell me you don't remember.
470,00:26:45.38,00:26:45.38,">> Well, that's just the way the game's played."
471,00:26:47.38,00:26:47.38,It wasn't anything personal. You were going after one of my
472,00:26:49.38,00:26:49.38,teammates... >> But you a dude.
473,00:26:51.38,00:26:51.38,Look at the match-up. Do you see women playing
474,00:26:53.38,00:26:53.38,football with men that play football?
475,00:26:55.38,00:26:55.38,>> That's because they can't. >> It's either all women...
476,00:26:57.04,00:26:57.04,>> They cannot... >> I want to know.
477,00:26:58.75,00:26:58.75,"They don't for a reason. So I want to know, why would a"
478,00:27:00.71,00:27:00.71,dude as tall as you tackle me? >> 'Cause you were going after
479,00:27:03.25,00:27:03.25,my teammate. >> That was very disrespectful.
480,00:27:05.25,00:27:05.25,>> Do you underst... >> But... I understand what
481,00:27:07.25,00:27:07.25,"you're saying, but you know what?"
482,00:27:08.46,00:27:08.46,"You're not showing me no sympathy, and you're not"
483,00:27:10.21,00:27:10.21,understanding what I'm saying. You're a dude.
484,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,"It doesn't matter. Yes, it is a game."
485,00:27:13.67,00:27:13.67,">> Listen, Grammar School. Listen, here's where it's..."
486,00:27:15.67,00:27:15.67,"here's where it's going, all right?"
487,00:27:17.46,00:27:17.46,">> Listen, Ignorant, since you want to say Grammar School."
488,00:27:19.21,00:27:19.21,>> Ignorant? What's the definition of ignorant?
489,00:27:21.21,00:27:21.21,">> Yeah, yeah. What's the definition of grammar school?"
490,00:27:22.62,00:27:22.62,I'm just telling you how I feel. But since I see I won't get
491,00:27:23.96,00:27:23.96,"nowhere with you, I won't waste my energy, but I wanted to let"
492,00:27:25.54,00:27:25.54,"you know because I don't back down to nobody, and I don't"
493,00:27:27.12,00:27:27.12,appreciate you tackling me. >> You won't get anywhere with
494,00:27:28.96,00:27:28.96,"me, not... no way. Yasmin is just a piece of work."
495,00:27:31.38,00:27:31.38,Yasmin has a big mouth. Yasmin smells bad.
496,00:27:34.50,00:27:34.50,She's got really poor grammar. I think Yasmin is pretty close
497,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,to being a hooker. >> You the one look like a fool.
498,00:27:43.38,00:27:43.38,You look like a big jerk going after a girl.
499,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"Okay, if a dude saw that on TV, they wouldn't say, ""Ooh, he"
500,00:27:47.62,00:27:47.62,"tackled a girl; he's the bomb."" They'd be, like, ""You know what?"
501,00:27:49.88,00:27:49.88,"He's a big sissy."" That's what they would say."
502,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,">> I say, ""Kill 'em all."" I say, ""Kill 'em all."""
503,00:27:53.88,00:27:53.88,">> That's what they would say, but you heard what I said."
504,00:27:55.88,00:27:55.88,">> Yeah, I heard your incorrect grammar the whole time."
505,00:27:57.88,00:27:57.88,>> Uh-huh. >> She was just barking up the
506,00:27:59.88,00:27:59.88,"wrong tree, 'cause I'm the one person that you just don't want"
507,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"to approach like that. >> And I see, you know what?"
508,00:28:03.96,00:28:03.96,>> You don't even know the definition of ignorant.
509,00:28:06.79,00:28:06.79,>> You're looking for a fight because you're ignorant.
510,00:28:08.38,00:28:08.38,>> You don't even know the definition of ignorant.
511,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,>> Who would tackle a girl that weighs 110?
512,00:28:12.08,00:28:12.08,">> You were going after my teammate, so just shut up."
513,00:28:13.71,00:28:13.71,You're in our camp. >> Ben is definitely a wild
514,00:28:15.50,00:28:15.50,card. He's definitely a liability.
515,00:28:17.50,00:28:17.50,He's saying things at challenges.
516,00:28:19.38,00:28:19.38,He's getting kicked out of challenges.
517,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"Um, honestly, I think what Ben's doing is stupid on his part."
518,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,">> She's ghetto trash, plain and simple."
519,00:28:28.58,00:28:28.58,>> That's right. >> She needs to go back to
520,00:28:31.12,00:28:31.12,eating ketchup sandwiches and drinking Kool-Aid and doing
521,00:28:33.67,00:28:33.67,whatever the hell she does and leave me alone.
522,00:28:36.08,00:28:36.08,>> You know what? I wish Yasmin was here for
523,00:28:38.54,00:28:38.54,another three days 'cause I love confrontation.
524,00:28:42.04,00:28:42.04,'Cause her and Ben start fighting.
525,00:28:44.58,00:28:44.58,Everybody starts hearing it. I love that.
526,00:28:47.21,00:28:47.21,That just makes everybody not like Ben.
527,00:28:49.38,00:28:49.38,"You know, I got some great plans set ahead, and, uh, it's"
528,00:28:52.50,00:28:52.50,going to be real fun. (scraping)
529,00:29:35.96,00:29:35.96,">> What do you think? (animal hooting, birds singing)"
530,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,">> Um, I don't know what's going on, but Ben was up all"
531,00:30:16.38,00:30:16.38,night. I think he's asking to be thrown
532,00:30:18.71,00:30:18.71,out. It was so ridiculous.
533,00:30:22.50,00:30:22.50,It was so crazy. Why would you hammer a machete
534,00:30:26.79,00:30:26.79,in the middle of the night? With a fire going.
535,00:30:29.04,00:30:29.04,There's no reason. So I don't think anybody's too
536,00:30:34.46,00:30:34.46,happy. >> I was getting really annoyed
537,00:30:38.00,00:30:38.00,"by the guy, and it's really starting to drive me crazy."
538,00:30:40.12,00:30:40.12,">> You know how he gets, man. Anybody calls him out on"
539,00:30:42.12,00:30:42.12,"anything, or he gets exasperated, he really just"
540,00:30:44.92,00:30:44.92,"unleashes, instead of just being like, ""Hey, man we need to talk"
541,00:30:48.25,00:30:48.25,"about this."" >> Who the hell hammers in the"
542,00:31:03.29,00:31:03.29,middle of the night? At nothing.
543,00:31:06.42,00:31:06.42,>> I don't know. >> I don't get him.
544,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,"Now that Mike's gone, my head is definitely on the chopping"
545,00:31:14.50,00:31:14.50,"block, 'cause I know they're all looking at me as being the"
546,00:31:17.33,00:31:17.33,elder and the weakest. But I don't want to go home at
547,00:31:21.25,00:31:21.25,all. I don't want to go home at all.
548,00:31:23.71,00:31:23.71,"I don't want to go home at all. Ben needs to go, in my opinion."
549,00:31:27.75,00:31:27.75,"I know that you're saying, ""Oh, we need him for strength or to"
550,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,"win challenges,"" but we haven't won any challenges, and plus, he"
551,00:31:33.71,00:31:33.71,"got kicked out of a challenge. So, I would have voted for him."
552,00:31:36.08,00:31:36.08,"Even if it didn't happen last night and all that, I was going"
553,00:31:38.08,00:31:38.08,to vote for him anyway. I was going to tell you I was
554,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"going to vote for him. >> Tonight, I think Betsy's"
555,00:31:43.08,00:31:43.08,"going home. We need to focus on challenges,"

568,00:32:28.25,00:32:28.25,which has never happened before-- they would be getting
569,00:32:31.08,00:32:31.08,voted off at Tribal Council. Why isn't it not Ben?

573,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,"you know, kind of pissing people off."

578,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,thing. We made a big sacrifice with
579,00:33:05.62,00:33:05.62,"Marisa and we kept the physical weakness, and we lost."
