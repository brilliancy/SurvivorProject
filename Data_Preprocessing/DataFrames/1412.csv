7,00:00:16.58,00:00:16.58,"attempt to save their necks, Alex and Mookie searched"
8,00:00:20.12,00:00:20.12,"through Yau-Man's bag. >> Yeah, he got it."
9,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,>> PROBST: And discovered his hidden immunity idol.
10,00:00:24.29,00:00:24.29,">> Just cause some hell, man. If I'm going down, I'm bringing"
11,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,hell with me. >> PROBST: When Alex and Mookie
12,00:00:29.21,00:00:29.21,"confronted Yau-Man... >> What do you want to do, Yau?"
13,00:00:31.25,00:00:31.25,>> You guys do what you need to do.
14,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,>> PROBST: ...he decided to tell everyone about the idol.
15,00:00:35.04,00:00:35.04,">> I thought that was a little dirty, but I will have to tell"
16,00:00:37.88,00:00:37.88,all my voting bloc straight out. They went through my bag.
17,00:00:40.92,00:00:40.92,">> They went through your bag, Yau-Man?"
18,00:00:42.12,00:00:42.12,">> Yeah, they went through my bag."
19,00:00:43.50,00:00:43.50,>> Alex went through Yau-Man's things and threatened him.
20,00:00:45.62,00:00:45.62,"They said, ""I know you have the immunity idol."""
21,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,>> Finding out that Yau-Man had the immunity idol changed a
22,00:00:50.54,00:00:50.54,whole bunch of stuff because everybody with the immunity
23,00:00:52.75,00:00:52.75,idol is considered dangerous. >> PROBST: At the reward
24,00:00:57.25,00:00:57.25,challenge... Mookie connects!
25,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,...The tribe was split into two teams.
26,00:01:00.96,00:01:00.96,Dreamz has it! Green wins reward!
27,00:01:04.46,00:01:04.46,"Dreamz secured victory for himself, Stacy, Earl and Alex."
28,00:01:08.21,00:01:08.21,"Boo, head on out. And they sent Boo to Exile"
29,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,"Island... >> ""The idol is back at your"

31,00:01:16.00,00:01:16.00,discovered the first clue to a newly hidden immunity idol.
32,00:01:18.88,00:01:18.88,>> It's not here. It's not my beach.
33,00:01:21.12,00:01:21.12,>> PROBST: At the immunity challenge...
34,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,>> D-4. >> PROBST: D-4 is a hit.
35,00:01:25.21,00:01:25.21,Alex out. Stacy wins individual immunity.
36,00:01:29.04,00:01:29.04,"...Stacy came out on top. Stacy, safe from tonight's"
37,00:01:32.12,00:01:32.12,Tribal Council. You are not.
38,00:01:34.04,00:01:34.04,There's somebody going home. Back at camp:
39,00:01:40.42,00:01:40.42,Fearing that Alex or Mookie could easily stumble upon the
40,00:01:42.71,00:01:42.71,"newly hidden immunity idol, Boo convinced his alliance to split"
41,00:01:44.79,00:01:44.79,"their vote. Earl and Yau-Man, however, were"
42,00:01:53.04,00:01:53.04,uneasy with the plan. >> Going into tonight's Tribal
43,00:02:01.04,00:02:01.04,Council split vote worries me very much.
44,00:02:03.50,00:02:03.50,I really... rather not see it. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council...
45,00:02:07.71,00:02:07.71,You cannot vote for Stacy. Everybody else is fair game.
46,00:02:11.25,00:02:11.25,"It's time to vote. Alex, you're up."
47,00:02:13.21,00:02:13.21,"...in a last-ditch effort to save himself, Alex turned on"
48,00:02:17.08,00:02:17.08,Mookie and helped vote him out. The 11th person voted out and
49,00:02:20.29,00:02:20.29,the fifth member of our jury: Mookie.
50,00:02:23.42,00:02:23.42,"Mookie, the tribe has spoken. Well, based on what I heard"
51,00:02:29.58,00:02:29.58,"tonight, Alex is either odd man out or suddenly very valuable."
52,00:02:33.75,00:02:33.75,Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
53,00:02:56.04,00:02:56.04,>> Tonight's vote was pretty important for me.
54,00:02:58.62,00:02:58.62,I know Mookie voted for Boo. I voted for Mookie.
55,00:03:04.79,00:03:04.79,">> My vote for Mookie is what saved my ass, basically."
56,00:03:08.62,00:03:08.62,"I was like, I'm gonna write down his name, go with my gut."
57,00:03:11.46,00:03:11.46,So I'm still here. (laughs)
58,00:03:15.46,00:03:15.46,"Yup, still here. >> I would have preferred Alex"
59,00:03:33.04,00:03:33.04,"would go. Alex is more of a threat, but"
60,00:03:35.79,00:03:35.79,"for some strange reason, they wanted to split the vote"
61,00:03:38.92,00:03:38.92,"between Mookie and Alex, and no one considered the fact that,"
62,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,"hey, did you ever think that Mookie and Alex have a vote?"
63,00:03:44.33,00:03:44.33,That they might vote for each other? Duh.
64,00:03:47.62,00:03:47.62,">> I don't want there to be, like, some kinda rift between"
65,00:03:49.96,00:03:49.96,"you and I. I'm willing to say if I'm wrong,"
66,00:03:52.04,00:03:52.04,I'm wrong. >> Whatever. You know.
67,00:03:54.04,00:03:54.04,"It's not that big a deal. After Tribal Council, Stacy"
68,00:03:57.42,00:03:57.42,"approached me, you know, trying to clear things up, telling me"
69,00:03:59.75,00:03:59.75,how she wants to be friends with me after this. Like I care.
70,00:04:09.96,00:04:09.96,">> So I understand... >> Who's ""everybody?"""
71,00:04:16.88,00:04:16.88,>> Everybody besides you and Alex.
72,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,">> At this point, they're all stressing out."
73,00:04:24.83,00:04:24.83,"Obviously, they're not all in agreement."
74,00:04:27.25,00:04:27.25,That always creates room and opportunity.
75,00:04:30.17,00:04:30.17,>> Why am I... Why are y... What's going on?
76,00:04:32.54,00:04:32.54,>> We're asking you a question. >> I don't know.
77,00:04:34.62,00:04:34.62,">> No, because Boo came over and he's like, ""Everybody wants to"
78,00:04:37.21,00:04:37.21,"talk to you."" >> He just wants to know."
79,00:04:38.83,00:04:38.83,">> My best bet was to just lay low, observe, let them get at"
80,00:04:42.62,00:04:42.62,"each other a little bit. From this point forward, I"
81,00:04:44.71,00:04:44.71,"think I'm gonna have to play this game with a smile, you"
82,00:04:47.88,00:04:47.88,"know, velvet gloves and a dagger in my pocket."
83,00:04:57.21,00:04:57.21,(theme song playing) \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
84,00:05:31.62,00:05:31.62,>> I definitely feel like I'm on the chopping block still.
85,00:05:34.12,00:05:34.12,"So after last night, I decided I'm going into ninja mode and"
86,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,"it started this morning, right? I woke up."
87,00:05:40.00,00:05:40.00,"I could have gone up, you know, gone around, done my business as"
88,00:05:42.58,00:05:42.58,"I normally do, but instead I just kinda laid there and just"
89,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,"kinda listened, tried to see, okay, who's still here?"
90,00:05:47.29,00:05:47.29,"Who's still at the campfire? Like, it's all about observation"
91,00:05:49.88,00:05:49.88,"for me, and I'm trying to make sure I'm not seen or heard,"
92,00:05:53.71,00:05:53.71,kinda like a ninja right now. >> Yau I trust 100%.
93,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,>> Mm-hmm. >> I only trust Yau and you
94,00:06:07.25,00:06:07.25,"100%. >> Oh, okay. Good."
95,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,>> Dreamz has been proving himself.
96,00:06:28.33,00:06:28.33,">> Mm-hmm. >> You know, he can be a little"
97,00:06:30.08,00:06:30.08,rogue at times with his strategy.
98,00:06:32.29,00:06:32.29,>> I'd look into that. I always felt that I could rely
99,00:06:35.54,00:06:35.54,"on Dreamz. >> The core alliance is myself,"
100,00:06:39.42,00:06:39.42,"Cassandra and Yau, but me and Cassandra talked about taking"
101,00:06:43.04,00:06:43.04,"Dreamz to the top four. Then we can just have the, the"
102,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,"core four. That's what they're called,"
103,00:06:49.08,00:06:49.08,"the core four. >> I mean, honestly, my concern"
104,00:06:55.75,00:06:55.75,"is you and Dreamz are tight. I mean, I don't see you voting"
105,00:06:58.33,00:06:58.33,"him out... So I'm, just saying,"
106,00:07:03.25,00:07:03.25,"mathematically, I'm off to my thing, you know."
107,00:07:09.71,00:07:09.71,Earl and I have a major disagreement as to who the top
108,00:07:13.71,00:07:13.71,four should be. His idea of the top four is
109,00:07:17.71,00:07:17.71,"myself, Earl, Cassandra and Dreamz."
110,00:07:22.12,00:07:22.12,That is a very bad top four for me to get to the next stage
111,00:07:27.46,00:07:27.46,"because Cassandra and, and Dreamz are very close."
112,00:07:31.71,00:07:31.71,"I would like a very weak candidate up there, but the"
113,00:07:35.71,00:07:35.71,"very weakest is Stacy, I know. I hate the idea; I really do."
114,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,I wish it was Michelle. I would like to see the top
115,00:07:42.71,00:07:42.71,"four as myself, Earl, Cassandra and Stacy because then I have"
116,00:07:46.75,00:07:46.75,a chance of getting to the top three.
117,00:08:22.12,00:08:22.12,">> I trust Yau-Man, but Yau-Man is definitely playing the game"
118,00:08:24.46,00:08:24.46,"for himself. Yau has immunity idol, and so"
119,00:08:27.08,00:08:27.08,I think Yau-Man is a real big threat.
120,00:08:29.17,00:08:29.17,I know he's playing the game and he's playing the game hard.
121,00:08:31.75,00:08:31.75,He's playing it like street ball: he's playing it to win it.
122,00:08:51.29,00:08:51.29,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing on day 31?"
123,00:09:04.71,00:09:04.71,>> We all are tired out here. >> Hungry.
124,00:09:07.38,00:09:07.38,>> PROBST: Hungry? Hungry plays in nicely to
125,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67,today's challenge. Shall we get to it?
126,00:09:11.75,00:09:11.75,>> Yes. >> Do it!
127,00:09:12.71,00:09:12.71,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, you are going to rip"
128,00:09:16.21,00:09:16.21,pieces of meat off a large piece of pork using only your
129,00:09:21.21,00:09:21.21,"teeth. Each time you get a mouthful,"
130,00:09:23.75,00:09:23.75,you'll drop it in your plate.
131,00:09:25.33,00:09:25.33,Whoever has the most meat on their plate at the end of five
132,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,minutes wins reward. Want to know what you're
133,00:09:30.54,00:09:30.54,playing for? >> Yeah.
134,00:09:31.50,00:09:31.50,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Tomorrow the winner
135,00:09:33.42,00:09:33.42,"and the first two runners-up will be picked up by helicopter,"
136,00:09:37.42,00:09:37.42,flown to one of the most beautiful places in Fiji.
137,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,Then you will river-raft the rain forest.
138,00:09:42.54,00:09:42.54,>> Oh... wow! >> PROBST: It is truly
139,00:09:44.25,00:09:44.25,"spectacular. You'll then have a nice lunch,"
140,00:09:46.62,00:09:46.62,"come back to camp. In addition, the winner of this"
141,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,challenge will send one person to Exile Island.
142,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"Finally, the winner of this challenge will also receive an"
143,00:09:56.21,00:09:56.21,advantage in the next immunity challenge.
144,00:10:00.12,00:10:00.12,Take your spot. We'll get your hands tied
145,00:10:01.71,00:10:01.71,behind your back and we'll get started.
146,00:10:06.96,00:10:06.96,Here we go. For reward and an advantage in
147,00:10:09.71,00:10:09.71,the next immunity challenge. Survivors ready?
148,00:10:14.96,00:10:14.96,Go! You got five minutes to tear
149,00:10:18.58,00:10:18.58,off as much pork as you can and get it on your plate.
150,00:10:22.29,00:10:22.29,There are no lanes. This is a free-for-all.
151,00:10:29.29,00:10:29.29,"Dreamz and Earl getting a good, quick start."
152,00:10:32.12,00:10:32.12,"Alex with a nice big piece. Yau-Man, Boo, Cassandra working"
153,00:10:44.96,00:10:44.96,together. Nobody working with Alex.
154,00:10:47.42,00:10:47.42,Boo with a huge piece. Yau-Man with a nice big chunk.
155,00:10:52.71,00:10:52.71,>> Cassandra. >> PROBST: Yau-Man looking for
156,00:10:54.54,00:10:54.54,some help from Cassandra. You need two people.
157,00:10:57.04,00:10:57.04,One to hold it steady. One to tear it off.
158,00:10:59.29,00:10:59.29,Dreamz with another big piece. Alex in it.
159,00:11:02.42,00:11:02.42,Cassandra still in it. Alex staying in it.
160,00:11:08.46,00:11:08.46,Yau-Man with a huge chunk! Earl picking it up off the dirt.

164,00:11:31.96,00:11:31.96,Boo is in it. Cassandra is in it.
165,00:11:33.96,00:11:33.96,Yau-Man is in it. Alex with another big piece.
166,00:11:36.67,00:11:36.67,It's going to be very close. One and a half minutes left in
167,00:11:39.67,00:11:39.67,this challenge. Dreamz is in it.
168,00:11:53.21,00:11:53.21,Alex not giving up. 15 seconds.
169,00:12:01.21,00:12:01.21,Whatever is in your mouth when I call time also counts.
170,00:12:05.75,00:12:05.75,"Five, four, three, two, one, stop!"
171,00:12:13.08,00:12:13.08,That's it! Whatever you have in your
172,00:12:15.25,00:12:15.25,"mouth, put on your plate. Start with Boo."
173,00:12:34.38,00:12:34.38,"Boo weighs in at 8.9 pounds. Boo, take a spot right up here."
174,00:12:40.54,00:12:40.54,"For now, you are in first place. Yau-Man weighs in at six pounds."
175,00:12:48.08,00:12:48.08,"Yau-Man, currently in second place."
176,00:12:54.96,00:12:54.96,Cassandra comes in at 5.8 pounds.
177,00:12:58.17,00:12:58.17,"Take a spot up here, Cassandra. Stacy in at 4.3 pounds."
178,00:13:05.17,00:13:05.17,"You can stay there. Earl, not enough."
179,00:13:10.08,00:13:10.08,Five pounds. Dreamz at six pounds also.
180,00:13:15.54,00:13:15.54,"Dreamz, you replace Cassandra. One plate left."
181,00:13:22.46,00:13:22.46,"If this is under six pounds, you're out of the reward, Alex."
182,00:13:30.17,00:13:30.17,It is not going to be enough. Boo wins the challenge.
183,00:13:35.21,00:13:35.21,">> Finally! >> PROBST: Yau-Man and Dreamz,"
184,00:13:37.17,00:13:37.17,first runners-up. You're going along with him on
185,00:13:39.75,00:13:39.75,"the reward. All right, Boo, first order of"
186,00:13:41.67,00:13:41.67,"business. Since you won the challenge,"
187,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83,you earn the right to send one person to Exile Island.
188,00:13:51.12,00:13:51.12,">> Earl, I know you don't take hard feelings to this."
189,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,I'm going to send you back. >> PROBST: Head on out.
190,00:13:57.58,00:13:57.58,Boat will pick you up. You'll be back in time for the
191,00:13:59.42,00:13:59.42,"next immunity challenge. Boo, this is your advantage for"
192,00:14:05.67,00:14:05.67,the next immunity challenge. You can ponder how that might
193,00:14:08.75,00:14:08.75,come into play. It will all make sense at the
194,00:14:11.08,00:14:11.08,"next challenge. All right, guys, head back to"
195,00:14:13.25,00:14:13.25,camp. >> Here it comes.
196,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,>> That's the one right there. Get a helicopter ride!
197,00:14:32.75,00:14:32.75,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep the camp safe."
198,00:14:35.83,00:14:35.83,We'll do what we can do. >> You guys have fun.
199,00:14:38.83,00:14:38.83,">> I won the reward challenge yesterday, along with Boo and"
200,00:14:43.62,00:14:43.62,"Dreamz, and we start out the day with a helicopter ride."
201,00:14:48.12,00:14:48.12,I've never been on a helicopter. Very excited.
202,00:14:52.04,00:14:52.04,>> Fly like the birds. >> I know. Right?
203,00:14:57.08,00:14:57.08,>> Wow! This is so cool!
204,00:15:00.04,00:15:00.04,>> For real. >> I'll be back!
205,00:15:03.38,00:15:03.38,>> Being in a helicopter flying was truly amazing flight for 
206,00:15:06.58,00:15:06.58,"somebody like me who grew up on islands like this, and to see it"
207,00:15:10.33,00:15:10.33,from the air was just an amazing experience.
208,00:15:13.29,00:15:13.29,>> Now we're going through the rain forest.
209,00:15:16.21,00:15:16.21,>> Wow! We're living la vida large!
210,00:15:19.62,00:15:19.62,>> How much you think it cost to rent one of these?
211,00:15:21.58,00:15:21.58,"I wouldn't mind spending, like, $600 or $700 on a really nice"
212,00:15:24.79,00:15:24.79,"date. I'd do it big like that, Dreamz."
213,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,>> There's Exile Island right there.
214,00:15:31.96,00:15:31.96,">> What's up, Earl? What's up, Earl?"
215,00:15:33.71,00:15:33.71,Holy moley! I still can't believe it.
216,00:15:39.12,00:15:39.12,"We rolling up in here, folks! Oh, this is comfortable."
217,00:15:51.42,00:15:51.42,">> During the reward, Boo was talking a lot, just trying to"
218,00:15:54.58,00:15:54.58,be... I don't know. He was just talking too much.
219,00:15:57.38,00:15:57.38,">> Hello. Can you hear me, Dreamz?"
220,00:16:00.29,00:16:00.29,"Hello. >> It's relaxing time, you know?"
221,00:16:03.88,00:16:03.88,It's time to chill. We won this.
222,00:16:06.21,00:16:06.21,Let's relax. Let's live it up.
223,00:16:07.79,00:16:07.79,It's just annoying. >> I'm hungry.
224,00:16:11.29,00:16:11.29,"We're going whitewater rafting, the most beautiful place in"
225,00:16:14.62,00:16:14.62,"Fiji. >> Oh, wow!"
226,00:16:17.25,00:16:17.25,What a ride! It was just unbelievable.
227,00:16:19.67,00:16:19.67,"And about an hour and a half into the trip, the helicopter"
228,00:16:22.88,00:16:22.88,"landed, and we had to hike for about ten minutes to get to the"
229,00:16:26.17,00:16:26.17,"river. >> So, personally, you guys, I "
230,00:16:28.50,00:16:28.50,want to welcome you guys. The name of this river is the 
231,00:16:30.21,00:16:30.21,"Apananuli. Secondly, it's really fast and"
232,00:16:32.42,00:16:32.42,so strong. >> So we were given a little
233,00:16:35.04,00:16:35.04,"safety briefing, and we got into a raft with the river"
234,00:16:39.29,00:16:39.29,"guide, and then we went down this rapids."
235,00:16:57.58,00:16:57.58,>> Then we went whitewater rafting.
236,00:16:59.71,00:16:59.71,"Probably never do it again, but it was so fun."
237,00:17:02.25,00:17:02.25,And I wish I could take my family or somebody on a trip
238,00:17:04.79,00:17:04.79,like that so they can experience what I experienced.
239,00:17:07.75,00:17:07.75,>> Look at that! Waterfall.
240,00:17:09.42,00:17:09.42,"Now, that's a waterfall. >> It's like a field trip for"
241,00:17:11.04,00:17:11.04,grown people. >> We're floating around in a
242,00:17:13.12,00:17:13.12,postcard here. You cannot get better than this.
243,00:17:16.04,00:17:16.04,"I told myself ten times, ""Look at this."
244,00:17:18.21,00:17:18.21,"Take it in. Look where you're at."""
245,00:17:20.50,00:17:20.50,"I am absolutely dumbfounded. I mean, I'm tickled pink."
246,00:17:25.08,00:17:25.08,I feel like a little girl. >> This is great.
247,00:17:43.00,00:17:43.00,">> This is what I came here for. ""Clue number two: Your normal"
248,00:17:49.88,00:17:49.88,winding paths you'll walk. It's inside a tree near a
249,00:17:54.71,00:17:54.71,"lonely tower of rock."" I'll figure it out."
250,00:17:58.88,00:17:58.88,I think two clues will be enough for me.
251,00:18:01.67,00:18:01.67,Can't wait to get back to camp to go looking for that idol.
252,00:18:04.83,00:18:04.83,"It would be all worth it. >> Oh, is that caviar?"
253,00:18:20.17,00:18:20.17,"Oh, this is good beef. >> That is awesome!"
254,00:18:22.62,00:18:22.62,">> Look at that! >> That's impressive, Dreamz."
255,00:18:26.54,00:18:26.54,">> We finally got to lunch, it was just so much stuff."
256,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,And I just kept eating it. We were back at camp living
257,00:18:31.08,00:18:31.08,"like cavemen in the dirt, having nothing, and living like"
258,00:18:34.96,00:18:34.96,"a broke, homeless guy, to living like you're rich."
259,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,">> The best, best part is, at the end of the lunch, our river"
260,00:18:44.96,00:18:44.96,guide came over and gave each of us an envelope.
261,00:18:51.54,00:18:51.54,And in the envelope are letters from home.
262,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,">> ""Dear Daddy, Miss you so much."
263,00:18:58.00,00:18:58.00,"I got six ""A""s and one ""B"" in algebra on my report card."""
264,00:19:01.42,00:19:01.42,"Why can't you get a ""B"" in Spanish or something? Man!"
265,00:19:05.42,00:19:05.42,Yeah! >> I'm going to read mine.
266,00:19:08.58,00:19:08.58,"""Hey, Boo, your dad and sister are doing really well."
267,00:19:11.12,00:19:11.12,Your dad's horses are eating well.
268,00:19:13.25,00:19:13.25,"Dad's kids are eating well  also."""
269,00:19:15.67,00:19:15.67,"Everybody is eating well. See, my family thinks..."
270,00:19:19.62,00:19:19.62,"Thanks, Mom. Oh, what a bonus, huh?"
271,00:19:23.46,00:19:23.46,"Am I crying yet? How you doing, Dreamz?"
272,00:19:27.38,00:19:27.38,You all right? >> When I read my sister's
273,00:19:31.21,00:19:31.21,"letter, you know, she said a lot of deep stuff."
274,00:19:33.96,00:19:33.96,She was saying that she never thought that one of us would
275,00:19:36.04,00:19:36.04,"have a chance, a opportunity. She thought it was over for the"
276,00:19:38.58,00:19:38.58,"family. You know, she thought that our"
277,00:19:40.25,00:19:40.25,"opportunity was up until, you know, I had the opportunity to"
278,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,"come here, and it really touched me that it was me that had the"
279,00:19:47.88,00:19:47.88,"opportunity to come, you know? >> Dreamz!"
280,00:19:52.04,00:19:52.04,>> It lets me know that she still believes in me even if I
281,00:19:56.12,00:19:56.12,"don't believe in myself, so it really brought a lot out of me."
282,00:19:59.58,00:19:59.58,It lets me know that my fight is just beginning.
283,00:20:02.42,00:20:02.42,I know what I got to do now. I remember my purpose here.
284,00:20:06.33,00:20:06.33,">> This is the best reward yet, you guys."
285,00:20:08.38,00:20:08.38,>> It's the best yet. >> Awesome!
286,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,">> My mom said, ""I know you can make a good situation out of"
287,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,"anything. You can't get tired of people."""
288,00:20:36.33,00:20:36.33,">> But, with Boo, you get tired of him."
289,00:20:38.21,00:20:38.21,He talks more than the girls talk.
290,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,>> I'm not really tired of him. It's just the talking.
291,00:20:49.29,00:20:49.29,">> During the helicopter ride, Boo just almost spoiled the"
292,00:20:52.88,00:20:52.88,trip for us. He definitely just talks too
293,00:20:54.92,00:20:54.92,much. Why don't you stop saying
294,00:20:58.96,00:20:58.96,stupid stuff? >> He's been like that since
295,00:21:01.29,00:21:01.29,day one. >> I cannot handle any more.
296,00:21:03.29,00:21:03.29,I'm not going to lie to you people.
297,00:21:04.83,00:21:04.83,I cannot handle any more. I'm losing it.
298,00:21:07.33,00:21:07.33,Boo has been irritating enough to where I don't think these
299,00:21:10.25,00:21:10.25,people want Boo to get the $1 million.
300,00:21:12.50,00:21:12.50,"So, if somebody starts Boo bashing, I'm going to feed the"
301,00:21:14.04,00:21:14.04,fire. I cannot deal anymore.
302,00:21:17.62,00:21:17.62,"Sorry, guys. If I hear something stupid, I"
303,00:21:21.88,00:21:21.88,"may call it out, and it may cause friction."
304,00:21:24.42,00:21:24.42,"People are not going to want to see certain people win and, "
305,00:21:27.25,00:21:27.25,"right now, I don't see Boo winning a popularity contest,"
306,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,"so if I can help steer things in an anti-Boo campaign, I am"
307,00:21:34.08,00:21:34.08,"all for it. >> I never liked Boo, and I"
308,00:21:54.92,00:21:54.92,"want Boo gone before Alex. Alex is still fighting strong,"
309,00:21:57.92,00:21:57.92,so I'm still making plans with Alex.
310,00:21:59.75,00:21:59.75,"So, point-blank, I'm just not going to let Boo win."
311,00:22:08.79,00:22:08.79,">> I'm going to try my damnedest, you know that."
312,00:22:10.58,00:22:10.58,"You do the same. If Boo wins immunity today, I"
313,00:22:15.46,00:22:15.46,think I'm pretty much screwed. Boo has a full belly and an
314,00:22:19.25,00:22:19.25,advantage in the next immunity challenge.
315,00:22:22.08,00:22:22.08,"But I need to keep myself alive in this thing, so I am focusing"
316,00:22:24.96,00:22:24.96,"all of my energy, all of my willpower on the challenge."
317,00:22:35.08,00:22:35.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Earl,"
318,00:22:48.54,00:22:48.54,returning from Exile Island. >> Bula.
319,00:22:52.79,00:22:52.79,>> Bula Bula. >> Great to see you.
320,00:22:56.08,00:22:56.08,">> Welcome back, Earl. >> PROBST: Are you guys ready"
321,00:22:59.67,00:22:59.67,to get to today's challenge? >> Let's do it.
322,00:23:01.96,00:23:01.96,">> PROBST: First things first, Stacy, take back immunity."
323,00:23:05.79,00:23:05.79,"Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up"
324,00:23:12.38,00:23:12.38,"for grabs. All right, at the last reward"
325,00:23:15.12,00:23:15.12,"challenge, Boo, you won an advantage in today's immunity"
326,00:23:18.17,00:23:18.17,challenge. Did you bring it with you?
327,00:23:19.88,00:23:19.88,">> Yes, I did. >> PROBST: Those are climbing"
328,00:23:27.21,00:23:27.21,"steps, and they are a big part of today's challenge."
329,00:23:30.50,00:23:30.50,"Boo, because you already have your steps, you do not have to"
330,00:23:33.17,00:23:33.17,participate in the first round of this challenge.
331,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,"You move on to the final. For the rest of you, on my"
332,00:23:40.08,00:23:40.08,"""go,"" you will race to dig up your three climbing steps that"
333,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,"are buried in the sand. When you have all three, you"
334,00:23:46.79,00:23:46.79,race to the finish. The first two people to get
335,00:23:50.25,00:23:50.25,their climbing steps join Boo in the final.
336,00:23:53.83,00:23:53.83,"For the final round, you will use those climbing steps to help"
337,00:23:57.17,00:23:57.17,you get to the top of a 12-foot pole.
338,00:24:00.58,00:24:00.58,"First person to get to the top, grab their flag, wins immunity,"
339,00:24:05.50,00:24:05.50,"stays alive in this game. For the rest of you, after 33"
340,00:24:09.08,00:24:09.08,"days, somebody will be going home tonight at Tribal Council."
341,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,Make sense? >> Yeah.
342,00:24:14.04,00:24:14.04,">> PROBST: We'll draw for spots, we'll get started."
343,00:24:18.58,00:24:18.58,"All right, here we go. First two people to finish join"
344,00:24:21.25,00:24:21.25,"Boo in the final round. Survivors, ready?"
345,00:24:23.83,00:24:23.83,Go! You're looking for three paddle
346,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,steps buried in different places in everybody's lane.
347,00:24:36.04,00:24:36.04,"Alex going after it, on a tear. Cassandra barely making a dent"
348,00:24:42.29,00:24:42.29,in that sand. Yau-Man making his way down the
349,00:24:45.96,00:24:45.96,course. Is he deep enough?
350,00:24:53.62,00:24:53.62,Dreamz has his first paddle step!
351,00:24:57.58,00:24:57.58,"Alex tearing up a lot of sand, no luck."
352,00:25:00.50,00:25:00.50,"Coming back to a new spot. Cassandra, digging like a small"
353,00:25:04.17,00:25:04.17,"rabbit, as if it's going to be buried one to two inches."
354,00:25:08.25,00:25:08.25,Yau-Man trying a very interesting method-- hugging
355,00:25:11.04,00:25:11.04,that sand. Dreamz has his second climbing
356,00:25:16.08,00:25:16.08,step. Stacy digging but finding
357,00:25:19.88,00:25:19.88,nothing. Alex has a huge hole.
358,00:25:23.62,00:25:23.62,Still no climbing step. Pick up the pace!
359,00:25:27.58,00:25:27.58,"You can rest later! Or you can rest tomorrow, just"
360,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,not at the beach. Dreamz has his third climbing
361,00:25:35.62,00:25:35.62,step. Dreamz moving on to the final
362,00:25:39.46,00:25:39.46,round with Boo. One more person moving on.
363,00:25:48.08,00:25:48.08,Yau-Man has his first climbing step.
364,00:25:51.25,00:25:51.25,Now Yau-Man knows how deep they are.
365,00:25:56.75,00:25:56.75,Alex has his first climbing step.
366,00:25:59.21,00:25:59.21,You're looking for three total. Alex getting all of the sand
367,00:26:05.79,00:26:05.79,out of his lane and moving most of it out onto Yau-Man's
368,00:26:08.58,00:26:08.58,course. Yau-Man putting his sand back
369,00:26:12.75,00:26:12.75,in Alex's lane. Alex has his second climbing
370,00:26:18.04,00:26:18.04,step. Alex now with two climbing
371,00:26:21.08,00:26:21.08,steps. Yau-Man has one.
372,00:26:25.54,00:26:25.54,Cassandra just waiting for it to be over.
373,00:26:32.21,00:26:32.21,Alex has his third climbing step.
374,00:26:35.46,00:26:35.46,"And with that, Alex moves on to the final round with Boo and"
375,00:26:39.75,00:26:39.75,"Dreamz. For the final round, we have"
376,00:26:51.25,00:26:51.25,"Boo, Alex, and Dreamz. First person to stand on top of"
377,00:26:55.38,00:26:55.38,the post and grab their flag wins immunity.
378,00:26:59.08,00:26:59.08,"Survivors, ready? Go!"
379,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,Boo up quickly. Alex right behind.
380,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,Boo skipping several cleats. Alex scaling to the top!
381,00:27:22.25,00:27:22.25,Can he pull it off? Boo is up there!
382,00:27:38.21,00:27:38.21,Boo wins immunity! >> Yeah!
383,00:27:44.50,00:27:44.50,Yeah! (cheering)
384,00:27:47.17,00:27:47.17,>> PROBST: That's three people who desperately wanted immunity.
385,00:27:50.12,00:27:50.12,That is not the easy way to do this challenge.
386,00:27:55.83,00:27:55.83,Boo not even waiting for an invitation.
387,00:27:59.92,00:27:59.92,">> Give it to me, Jeff. >> PROBST: Boo safe from the"
388,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,"vote tonight. Yau-Man, Earl, Stacy,"
389,00:28:08.42,00:28:08.42,"Cassandra, Dreamz, and Alex, somebody going home tonight."
390,00:28:12.38,00:28:12.38,"I'll see you at Tribal. >> Fortunately for us, the"
391,00:28:45.96,00:28:45.96,person who we wanted to vote out today did not win the immunity
392,00:28:49.96,00:28:49.96,"necklace, so... Alex will get voted out today."
393,00:28:53.88,00:28:53.88,">> Can we sit here and say, well, everybody right now,"
394,00:28:56.04,00:28:56.04,"Alex's name, please? >> No, I'm going to give him"
395,00:28:58.92,00:28:58.92,this necklace. >> I'll freakin' tackle you.
396,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,That would be the greatest Tribal Council ever 'cause we'd
397,00:29:05.54,00:29:05.54,be fighting all in there. >> Today I'm feeling quite safe
398,00:29:09.25,00:29:09.25,because we have all agreed that Alex is the odd man out and
399,00:29:12.62,00:29:12.62,"needs to be taken out, so I'm feeling safe enough that I do"
400,00:29:16.12,00:29:16.12,not think I will need to use my hidden immunity idol.
401,00:29:24.62,00:29:24.62,">> The situation is grim. But, you know, I'm not going to"
402,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,approach these people with desperation.
403,00:29:29.08,00:29:29.08,I'm not going to beg for my life.
404,00:29:30.58,00:29:30.58,That's not the way it works for me.
405,00:29:32.38,00:29:32.38,"Right now, taking an aggressive approach to anything would be a"
406,00:29:35.62,00:29:35.62,"bad idea, especially given my position."
407,00:29:38.33,00:29:38.33,I think the people that I need to talk to will talk to me.
408,00:29:41.17,00:29:41.17,I think they'll approach me. I think I've earned enough of
409,00:29:43.88,00:29:43.88,their respect they'll all at least want to say something to
410,00:29:46.75,00:29:46.75,"me before tonight's vote. >> Hey, Alex."
411,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,">> Hey, Cassandra. >> I hate to see you back down"
412,00:29:56.04,00:29:56.04,here by yourself. >> I'm okay.
413,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,I'm just tired. >> You're just tired?
414,00:30:01.92,00:30:01.92,I know we started out together...
415,00:30:05.04,00:30:05.04,">> Yeah, we did. >> Just relax."
416,00:30:07.62,00:30:07.62,You should be very proud of yourself.
417,00:30:09.88,00:30:09.88,"We all are. >> Yeah, I tried to be a"
418,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,"gentleman, you know. I tried to give it my all and"
419,00:30:15.00,00:30:15.00,do something that my kids could be proud of someday.
420,00:30:40.12,00:30:40.12,">> Oh, okay. Mm-hmm."
421,00:30:48.17,00:30:48.17,That's true. Alex is trying his last effort
422,00:30:51.92,00:30:51.92,"to make a pitch to stay on longer, and he presented a"
423,00:30:55.21,00:30:55.21,strong case. His argument was that Yau-Man
424,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,"has the idol, and he's going to take Boo and Stacy with him"
425,00:31:02.08,00:31:02.08,"because he knows, their personalities, people are not"
426,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,going to vote for them to get the million dollars.
427,00:31:06.71,00:31:06.71,It all started to make a little sense.
428,00:31:08.12,00:31:08.12,"I felt like, you know, Yau-Man is going to eventually have to"
429,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,"leave, so why not tonight? Maybe I'll be able to convince"
430,00:31:14.67,00:31:14.67,other people of that. >> I get nervous when I'm
431,00:31:48.38,00:31:48.38,"alone, you know. They're all talking about me."
432,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,>> I don't think so. >> I anticipated this.
433,00:32:06.04,00:32:06.04,"So Alex is just trying to save his neck and say, ""You guys"
434,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,should use my vote. This is your only chance to
435,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"take Yau-Man out."" But you know what?"
436,00:32:13.38,00:32:13.38,"I'd rather just vote your ass off now, and I'll risk it."
437,00:32:22.33,00:32:22.33,">> Alex was talking to Cassandra and Dreamz, and they seemed"
438,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,"like they were listening, but they weren't."
439,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,I kind of like winked at them a couple of times.
440,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,"You know, you just play along with him."
441,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,I don't think they're taking it serious.
442,00:32:38.54,00:32:38.54,">> You really buying this? >> I'm buying it, but I'm"
443,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,"like, then where does Alex fit in everywhere?"
444,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,">> He don't. That's the whole thing, he's"
445,00:32:45.12,00:32:45.12,"gonna... after me, you and Earl, the whole plan, regardless of"
446,00:32:48.75,00:32:48.75,"what happens, it's me, you and Earl getting to the top three."
447,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,">> You know, Dreamz, like I told you from day one..."
448,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,>> I really want to do that tonight.
449,00:33:00.58,00:33:00.58,"The plan was to get rid of Alex tonight, but Alex is my friend,"
450,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,"and Yau-Man has the immunity idol, and that makes him so"
451,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,dangerous. Yau-Man has already said that I
452,00:33:09.33,00:33:09.33,"was a big threat, so if he could put that immunity idol into"
453,00:33:12.83,00:33:12.83,"play, that means he goes to try to get rid of me."
454,00:33:19.92,00:33:19.92,>> You're down with that? >> Yup.
455,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,">> Cassandra, what do you want to do?"
456,00:33:23.25,00:33:23.25,">> I'm down with you, Dreamz. I told you from day one..."
457,00:33:25.25,00:33:25.25,I told you from day one... >> And I'm like a freakin'
458,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,follower. I follow Cassandra.
459,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,">> If Cassandra's down with this, it's gonna definitely go"
460,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,through. >> It's pretty safe to say if I
461,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,"vote Yau-Man out, Stacy and Dreamz will more than likely"
462,00:33:38.17,00:33:38.17,"vote with me. And so, um, I definitely have a"
463,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,"choice to make, either to vote Alex or Yau-Man."
464,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,"And at this point right now, I'm very undecided."
465,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,I'm not sure what I'm going to do tonight.
466,00:34:39.38,00:34:39.38,>> I'm writing down A-L-E-X. >> Mm-hmm.
467,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,I think Earl is very close to Yau-Man.
468,00:34:48.04,00:34:48.04,There's no way he'd go for it. So in order to blindside
469,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,"Yau-Man, we definitely feel like we have to blindside Earl at the"
470,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,"same time. And so um, my head is telling me"
471,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,"one thing, and my heart is saying another thing."
472,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,"So I'm hoping that by the time it's time for Tribal Council,"
473,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,I'll have a clear feeling exactly who I'm going to vote
474,00:35:07.96,00:35:07.96,for. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
475,00:35:33.46,00:35:33.46,"the jury. Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo,"
476,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,"and Mookie, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
477,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"Alex, last Tribal Council, it was you or Mookie."
478,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,>> Right. >> PROBST: Mookie's over there.
479,00:35:55.83,00:35:55.83,">> I'm definitely feeling the heat, Jeff."
480,00:35:57.38,00:35:57.38,"But I told these guys, if I'm going to be in this, you know"
481,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"me, I'm going to fight to the very end."
482,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,And for people who are sitting here you have to consider who
483,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33,"you really want next to you. And, you know, people forget"
484,00:36:06.29,00:36:06.29,"alliances. Things are going to get very,"
485,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,very messy from this point forward whether I'm here or not.
486,00:36:12.12,00:36:12.12,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, if something dramatic was going to happen,"
487,00:36:14.38,00:36:14.38,tonight's a good name night for it.
488,00:36:16.21,00:36:16.21,You got six people. Suddenly Alex becomes very
489,00:36:18.92,00:36:18.92,valuable. Does that concern you?
490,00:36:21.71,00:36:21.71,">> I've thought about that scenario, but because I have"
491,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"been with my alliance for so long, I have decided that I can"
492,00:36:27.08,00:36:27.08,actually trust them up to this point.
493,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,"I can see maybe turning one, possibly two, but to be able to"
494,00:36:32.62,00:36:32.62,"turn three over, that's a very remote possibility at this time."
495,00:36:36.21,00:36:36.21,"I may be wrong, but I hope I'm not."
496,00:36:39.62,00:36:39.62,">> PROBST: Dreamz, do you believe that these six are as"
497,00:36:42.33,00:36:42.33,"tight as they say? It's Alex tonight, that's it,"
498,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,and then tomorrow we deal with the six?
499,00:36:47.92,00:36:47.92,>> It's definitely a possibility that he can swing
500,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"three people, you know what I mean."
501,00:36:51.62,00:36:51.62,It's not totally out of the question.
502,00:36:53.46,00:36:53.46,">> PROBST: Alex, you obviously had to try to do something"
503,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,today. Do you lie down and die or do
504,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,you start looking for cracks? >> I guess we'll find out
505,00:37:01.38,00:37:01.38,"tonight, Jeff. >> PROBST: Let's talk about the"
506,00:37:06.50,00:37:06.50,"hidden immunity idol. Yau-Man, in some ways it"
507,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"represents safety. In other ways, you could be a"
508,00:37:11.92,00:37:11.92,target simply because you have it.
509,00:37:14.96,00:37:14.96,">> I don't feel the pressure today, but the next round, I"
510,00:37:17.62,00:37:17.62,think I will feel the pressure when the six original alliance
511,00:37:20.62,00:37:20.62,members are going to look around for somebody to vote
512,00:37:23.04,00:37:23.04,"out, they may decide to flush the idol out so that I cannot"
513,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,"use it for some nefarious purpose, so at that point I"
514,00:37:30.33,00:37:30.33,will have to really keep my ears close to the ground and
515,00:37:32.42,00:37:32.42,"see what's going on. >> PROBST: Alex, what kind of"
516,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,chatter has there been about the other hidden immunity idol?
517,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,>> With one immunity idol out and another one possibly on its
518,00:37:42.04,00:37:42.04,"way, I mean, that's got to weigh in on people's minds."
519,00:37:44.75,00:37:44.75,"You can only use them tonight, the next Tribal Council and"
520,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,"the one after that. That's three opportunities, two"
521,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,idols. You do the math on that.
522,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,"If it doesn't go down tonight, it's going down in the next"
523,00:37:54.12,00:37:54.12,couple of Tribal Councils. So now or never.
524,00:37:56.46,00:37:56.46,Maybe the next time might be now or never.
525,00:37:58.38,00:37:58.38,You just never know. >> PROBST: Are you surprised
526,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,how unconcerned these six seem to be?
527,00:38:03.04,00:38:03.04,>> I'm very surprised by it. I mean either they are
528,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,completely 100% trustworthy or they haven't seen enough of this
529,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,"game. I mean, if it really comes down"
530,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,"to them six after this, they have to think people are"
531,00:38:13.46,00:38:13.46,thinking more than one move ahead.
532,00:38:15.21,00:38:15.21,It's very plausible. There are only a few days left. 
533,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,"You got to think ahead, I think, at this point."
534,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,">> PROBST: Before we get to the vote, one quick question: yes"
535,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,"or no answer, Alex, legitimately concerned tonight?"
536,00:38:26.38,00:38:26.38,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Cassandra?
537,00:38:28.25,00:38:28.25,>> No. >> PROBST: Dreamz?
538,00:38:30.67,00:38:30.67,">> I don't think so, Jeff, not now."
539,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,">> PROBST: Stacy, legitimately concerned?"
540,00:38:34.75,00:38:34.75,>> No. >> PROBST: Yau-Man?
541,00:38:36.42,00:38:36.42,>> No. >> PROBST: Earl?
542,00:38:39.88,00:38:39.88,">> No. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
543,00:38:43.04,00:38:43.04,to the vote. If somebody does have a hidden
544,00:38:45.08,00:38:45.08,"immunity idol and you want to play it, you would present it to"
545,00:38:47.54,00:38:47.54,"me before I read the votes. Boo, you have individual"
546,00:38:50.46,00:38:50.46,immunity. Are you going to hang on to
547,00:38:52.12,00:38:52.12,"that? >> Yes, I will, Jeff."
548,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Boo. Everybody else is fair game.
549,00:38:56.04,00:38:56.04,"Alex, you're up. >> Nothing personal, Yau-Man."
550,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,Just trying to stay in this as long as I can.
551,00:39:21.83,00:39:21.83,>> Good-bye. It's finally time for you to go.
552,00:39:51.33,00:39:51.33,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
553,00:40:02.33,00:40:02.33,If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to
554,00:40:05.04,00:40:05.04,"play it, now is the time to do so."
555,00:40:15.54,00:40:15.54,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
556,00:40:17.92,00:40:17.92,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
557,00:40:19.83,00:40:19.83,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
558,00:40:25.50,00:40:25.50,First vote: Alex. Yau-Man.
