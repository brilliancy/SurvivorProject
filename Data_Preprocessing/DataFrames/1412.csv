297,00:21:07.33,00:21:07.33,Boo has been irritating enoughto where I don't think these
298,00:21:10.25,00:21:10.25,people want Boo to get the$1 million.
299,00:21:12.50,00:21:12.50,"So, if somebody starts Boobashing, I'm going to feed the"

304,00:21:27.25,00:21:27.25,"right now, I don't see Boowinning a popularity contest,"
305,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,"so if I can help steer thingsin an anti-Boo campaign, I am"
306,00:21:34.08,00:21:34.08,"all for it.>> I never liked Boo, and I"
307,00:21:54.92,00:21:54.92,"want Boo gone before Alex.Alex is still fighting strong,"

309,00:21:59.75,00:21:59.75,"So, point-blank, I'm just notgoing to let Boo win."

378,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,Boo up quickly.Alex right behind.
379,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,Boo skipping several cleats.Alex scaling to the top!
380,00:27:22.25,00:27:22.25,Can he pull it off?Boo is up there!
381,00:27:38.21,00:27:38.21,Boo wins immunity!>> Yeah!
382,00:27:44.50,00:27:44.50,Yeah!(cheering)

384,00:27:50.12,00:27:50.12,That is not the easy way to dothis challenge.
385,00:27:55.83,00:27:55.83,Boo not even waiting for aninvitation.

390,00:28:45.96,00:28:45.96,person who we wanted to vote outtoday did not win the immunity

392,00:28:53.88,00:28:53.88,">> Can we sit here and say,well, everybody right now,"
393,00:28:56.04,00:28:56.04,"Alex's name, please?>> No, I'm going to give him"
394,00:28:58.92,00:28:58.92,this necklace.>> I'll freakin' tackle you.
395,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,That would be the greatestTribal Council ever 'cause we'd
396,00:29:05.54,00:29:05.54,be fighting all in there.>> Today I'm feeling quite safe
397,00:29:09.25,00:29:09.25,because we have all agreed thatAlex is the odd man out and
398,00:29:12.62,00:29:12.62,"needs to be taken out, so I'mfeeling safe enough that I do"
399,00:29:16.12,00:29:16.12,not think I will need to use myhidden immunity idol.
400,00:29:24.62,00:29:24.62,">> The situation is grim.But, you know, I'm not going to"
401,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,approach these people withdesperation.
402,00:29:29.08,00:29:29.08,I'm not going to beg for mylife.
403,00:29:30.58,00:29:30.58,That's not the way it works forme.
404,00:29:32.38,00:29:32.38,"Right now, taking an aggressiveapproach to anything would be a"
405,00:29:35.62,00:29:35.62,"bad idea, especially given myposition."
406,00:29:38.33,00:29:38.33,I think the people that I needto talk to will talk to me.
407,00:29:41.17,00:29:41.17,I think they'll approach me.I think I've earned enough of
408,00:29:43.88,00:29:43.88,their respect they'll all atleast want to say something to
409,00:29:46.75,00:29:46.75,"me before tonight's vote.>> Hey, Alex."
410,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,">> Hey, Cassandra.>> I hate to see you back down"
411,00:29:56.04,00:29:56.04,here by yourself.>> I'm okay.
412,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,I'm just tired.>> You're just tired?
413,00:30:01.92,00:30:01.92,I know we started outtogether...
414,00:30:05.04,00:30:05.04,">> Yeah, we did.>> Just relax."
415,00:30:07.62,00:30:07.62,You should be very proud ofyourself.
416,00:30:09.88,00:30:09.88,"We all are.>> Yeah, I tried to be a"
417,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,"gentleman, you know.I tried to give it my all and"
418,00:30:15.00,00:30:15.00,do something that my kids couldbe proud of someday.
419,00:30:40.12,00:30:40.12,">> Oh, okay.Mm-hmm."
420,00:30:48.17,00:30:48.17,That's true.Alex is trying his last effort
421,00:30:51.92,00:30:51.92,"to make a pitch to stay onlonger, and he presented a"
422,00:30:55.21,00:30:55.21,strong case.His argument was that Yau-Man
423,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,"has the idol, and he's going totake Boo and Stacy with him"
424,00:31:02.08,00:31:02.08,"because he knows, theirpersonalities, people are not"
425,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,going to vote for them to getthe million dollars.
426,00:31:06.71,00:31:06.71,It all started to make a littlesense.
427,00:31:08.12,00:31:08.12,"I felt like, you know, Yau-Manis going to eventually have to"
428,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,"leave, so why not tonight?Maybe I'll be able to convince"
429,00:31:14.67,00:31:14.67,other people of that.>> I get nervous when I'm
430,00:31:48.38,00:31:48.38,"alone, you know.They're all talking about me."
431,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,>> I don't think so.>> I anticipated this.
432,00:32:06.04,00:32:06.04,"So Alex is just trying to savehis neck and say, ""You guys"
433,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,should use my vote.This is your only chance to
434,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"take Yau-Man out.""But you know what?"
435,00:32:13.38,00:32:13.38,"I'd rather just vote your assoff now, and I'll risk it."
436,00:32:22.33,00:32:22.33,">> Alex was talking to Cassandraand Dreamz, and they seemed"
437,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,"like they were listening, butthey weren't."
438,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,I kind of like winked at them acouple of times.
439,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,"You know, you just play alongwith him."
440,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,I don't think they're taking itserious.
441,00:32:38.54,00:32:38.54,">> You really buying this?>> I'm buying it, but I'm"
442,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,"like, then where does Alex fitin everywhere?"
443,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,">> He don't.That's the whole thing, he's"
444,00:32:45.12,00:32:45.12,"gonna... after me, you and Earl,the whole plan, regardless of"
445,00:32:48.75,00:32:48.75,"what happens, it's me, you andEarl getting to the top three."
446,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,">> You know, Dreamz, like I toldyou from day one..."
447,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,>> I really want to do thattonight.
448,00:33:00.58,00:33:00.58,"The plan was to get rid of Alextonight, but Alex is my friend,"
449,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,"and Yau-Man has the immunityidol, and that makes him so"
450,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,dangerous.Yau-Man has already said that I
451,00:33:09.33,00:33:09.33,"was a big threat, so if he couldput that immunity idol into"
452,00:33:12.83,00:33:12.83,"play, that means he goes to tryto get rid of me."
453,00:33:19.92,00:33:19.92,>> You're down with that?>> Yup.
454,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,">> Cassandra, what do you wantto do?"
455,00:33:23.25,00:33:23.25,">> I'm down with you, Dreamz.I told you from day one..."
456,00:33:25.25,00:33:25.25,I told you from day one...>> And I'm like a freakin'
457,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,follower.I follow Cassandra.
458,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,">> If Cassandra's down withthis, it's gonna definitely go"
459,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,through.>> It's pretty safe to say if I
460,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,"vote Yau-Man out, Stacy andDreamz will more than likely"
461,00:33:38.17,00:33:38.17,"vote with me.And so, um, I definitely have a"
462,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,"choice to make, either to voteAlex or Yau-Man."
463,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,"And at this point right now,I'm very undecided."
464,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,I'm not sure what I'm going todo tonight.
465,00:34:39.38,00:34:39.38,>> I'm writing down A-L-E-X.>> Mm-hmm.
466,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,I think Earl is very closeto Yau-Man.
467,00:34:48.04,00:34:48.04,There's no way he'd go for it.So in order to blindside
468,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,"Yau-Man, we definitely feel likewe have to blindside Earl at the"
469,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,"same time.And so um, my head is telling me"
470,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,"one thing, and my heart issaying another thing."
471,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,"So I'm hoping that by the timeit's time for Tribal Council,"
472,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,I'll have a clear feelingexactly who I'm going to vote

474,00:35:33.46,00:35:33.46,"the jury.Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo,"
475,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,"and Mookie, voted out at thelast Tribal Council."
476,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"Alex, last Tribal Council, itwas you or Mookie."
477,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,>> Right.>> PROBST: Mookie's over there.
478,00:35:55.83,00:35:55.83,">> I'm definitely feeling theheat, Jeff."
479,00:35:57.38,00:35:57.38,"But I told these guys, if I'mgoing to be in this, you know"
480,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"me, I'm going to fight to thevery end."
481,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,And for people who are sittinghere you have to consider who
482,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33,"you really want next to you.And, you know, people forget"
483,00:36:06.29,00:36:06.29,"alliances.Things are going to get very,"
484,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,very messy from this pointforward whether I'm here or not.
485,00:36:12.12,00:36:12.12,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, if somethingdramatic was going to happen,"
486,00:36:14.38,00:36:14.38,tonight's a good name night forit.
487,00:36:16.21,00:36:16.21,You got six people.Suddenly Alex becomes very
488,00:36:18.92,00:36:18.92,valuable.Does that concern you?
489,00:36:21.71,00:36:21.71,">> I've thought about thatscenario, but because I have"
490,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"been with my alliance for solong, I have decided that I can"
491,00:36:27.08,00:36:27.08,actually trust them up to thispoint.
492,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,"I can see maybe turning one,possibly two, but to be able to"
493,00:36:32.62,00:36:32.62,"turn three over, that's a veryremote possibility at this time."
494,00:36:36.21,00:36:36.21,"I may be wrong, but I hope I'mnot."
495,00:36:39.62,00:36:39.62,">> PROBST: Dreamz, do youbelieve that these six are as"
496,00:36:42.33,00:36:42.33,"tight as they say?It's Alex tonight, that's it,"
497,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,and then tomorrow we deal withthe six?
498,00:36:47.92,00:36:47.92,>> It's definitely apossibility that he can swing
499,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"three people, you know what Imean."
500,00:36:51.62,00:36:51.62,It's not totally out of thequestion.
501,00:36:53.46,00:36:53.46,">> PROBST: Alex, you obviouslyhad to try to do something"
502,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,today.Do you lie down and die or do

509,00:37:17.62,00:37:17.62,think I will feel the pressurewhen the six original alliance

511,00:37:23.04,00:37:23.04,"out, they may decide to flushthe idol out so that I cannot"
512,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,"use it for some nefariouspurpose, so at that point I"
513,00:37:30.33,00:37:30.33,will have to really keepmy ears close to the ground and
514,00:37:32.42,00:37:32.42,"see what's going on.>> PROBST: Alex, what kind of"
515,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,chatter has there been aboutthe other hidden immunity idol?
516,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,>> With one immunity idol outand another one possibly on its
517,00:37:42.04,00:37:42.04,"way, I mean, that's got to weighin on people's minds."
518,00:37:44.75,00:37:44.75,"You can only use them tonight,the next Tribal Council and"
519,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,"the one after that.That's three opportunities, two"
520,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,idols.You do the math on that.
521,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,"If it doesn't go down tonight,it's going down in the next"
522,00:37:54.12,00:37:54.12,couple of Tribal Councils.So now or never.
523,00:37:56.46,00:37:56.46,Maybe the next time might be nowor never.
524,00:37:58.38,00:37:58.38,You just never know.>> PROBST: Are you surprised
525,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,how unconcerned these six seemto be?
526,00:38:03.04,00:38:03.04,>> I'm very surprised by it.I mean either they are
527,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,completely 100% trustworthy orthey haven't seen enough of this
528,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,"game.I mean, if it really comes down"
529,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,"to them six after this, theyhave to think people are"
530,00:38:13.46,00:38:13.46,thinking more than onemove ahead.
531,00:38:15.21,00:38:15.21,It's very plausible.There are only a few days left. 
532,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,"You got to think ahead, I think,at this point."
