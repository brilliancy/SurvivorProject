546,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,GETTING ELIMINATED OR NOT. >> RIGHT.
547,00:33:53.23,00:33:53.23,THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME?
548,00:33:55.70,00:33:55.70,">> NO, NOT TO TEEN ANNO. >> NO."

552,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,TALKING ABOUT. >> I KNOW MY NAME'S BEEN THROWN
553,00:34:10.50,00:34:10.50,OUT THERE. I'VE ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE
554,00:34:12.73,00:34:12.73,"TRUTH, AND SHE WON'T. IF SOMEBODY IS GUNNING FOR ME,"
555,00:34:15.77,00:34:15.77,WHICH I CAN FEEL IT. I CAN SENSE IT IN KAT THAT SHE
556,00:34:20.43,00:34:20.43,"IS, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO KEEP THEM AROUND."
557,00:34:22.27,00:34:22.27,>> I WANT TO GO ALL GIRL STRONG. I DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE TO
558,00:34:25.87,00:34:25.87,COMMUNICATE ABOUT ALLT ALL THE TIME.
559,00:34:28.10,00:34:28.10,"LIKE-- MONICA'S VERY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE WHEN SHE STRATEGIZES"
560,00:34:31.43,00:34:31.43,PEOPLE ACTUALLY MIGHT LISTEN TO HER.
561,00:34:33.40,00:34:33.40,SO MY BACK'S UP AGAINST THE WALL.
562,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO STAY HERE AND THAT'S IT.
563,00:34:37.57,00:34:37.57,>> I'M SORRY. >> SO IF VYTAS HAS TO GO HOME
564,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,"TONIGHT, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO HOME."
565,00:34:42.27,00:34:42.27,THAT'S HOW THE NATURE OF THE GAME GOES.
566,00:34:44.37,00:34:44.37,">> YOU KNOW WHO, RIGHT? >> NOT FOR SURE."
567,00:34:47.67,00:34:47.67,STILLV? >> YEAH.
568,00:34:48.13,00:34:48.13,>> OKAY. >> AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME.
569,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,>> OR NOT ME. >> I TEACH MY KIDS DO UNTO
570,00:34:57.10,00:34:57.10,OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WANT THIM TO DO UNTO YOU.
571,00:34:59.43,00:34:59.43,"BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IN ""SURVIVOR ""I FIGURED IT OUT."
572,00:35:04.53,00:35:04.53,IT'S DO UNTO OTHERS BEFORE THEY DO UNTO YOU.
573,00:35:08.10,00:35:08.10,>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT KAT? IF SOMEBODY IS IT GUNNING FOR ME
574,00:35:11.23,00:35:11.23,I'M WRITING HER NAME DOWN. I'M TRYING TO CORAL AND PERSUADE
575,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80,EVERYBODY IN THIS TRIBE TO DO THE SAME THING.
576,00:35:17.43,00:35:17.43,>> I THINK THE BEST THING IS FOR KAT TO GO.
577,00:35:19.33,00:35:19.33,>> WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION TONIGHT WHO DOES IT MAKE SENSE
578,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,"TO SEND, CAPT OR VYTAS? I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STAY"
579,00:35:28.80,00:35:28.80,"WITH THE PLAN, WHICH IS TO VOTE FOR VYTAS."
580,00:35:31.37,00:35:31.37,"BUT KAT'S LOYALTY, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT."
581,00:35:34.37,00:35:34.37,"WHO SHOULD GO? HONESTLY, IT IS A COIN TOSS."
582,00:35:37.23,00:35:37.23,IT IS 50-50. >> Jeff: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
583,00:36:05.70,00:36:05.70,"THE TRIBE SWITCH. KAT, NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE."
584,00:36:07.97,00:36:07.97,WHO'S NOT GETTING ALONG? >> I GUESS IT'S JUST BETWEEN
585,00:36:11.97,00:36:11.97,"MONICA AND I. I SAW MONICA WAS KIND OF DOWN,"
586,00:36:14.43,00:36:14.43,SO I JUST WENT OVER TO ASK HER HOW SHE'S DOING.
587,00:36:17.07,00:36:17.07,AND THE CONVERSATION DIDN'T END UP AS WELL AS I THOUGHT IT
588,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,WOULD. >> Jeff: MONICA WHAT WAS THE
589,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,"CONVERSATION ABOUT, FROM YOUR SIDE?"
590,00:36:22.90,00:36:22.90,>> JUST ABOUT THE GAME. AND TRUST ISSUES.
591,00:36:25.43,00:36:25.43,"I MEAN, ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF TRUST."
592,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH FROM THIS YOUNG LADY BECAUSE I
593,00:36:33.63,00:36:33.63,GENUINELY AM CHEERING FOR HER. AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT.
594,00:36:37.10,00:36:37.10,">> MONICA, THIS SHOULDN'T BE ANY YOU AND I RIGHT NOW."
595,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,">> I UNDERSTAND. >> LIKE, I GENUINELY LOVE"
596,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,"MONICA, AND I LOVE THESE GIRLS. LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE THEIR BACK."
597,00:36:45.80,00:36:45.80,"AND IF WE ALL MAKE IT TO THE MERGE, I FEEL LIKE THAT WE"
598,00:36:48.67,00:36:48.67,SHOULD ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER. NO OFFENSE.
599,00:36:51.70,00:36:51.70,NO OFFENSE. >> Jeff: THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN
600,00:36:53.60,00:36:53.60,IF TONIGHT VYTAS IS VOTED OUT. >> JEFF KAT'S GOING TO WRITE MY
601,00:36:57.27,00:36:57.27,NAME DOWN TONIGHT PROBABLY. AND I FEEL FOR THEIR
602,00:36:59.30,00:36:59.30,"RELATIONSHIP, BUT TRUST IN THIS GAME IS STICKING WITH YOUR"
603,00:37:01.53,00:37:01.53,ALLIANCE NO MATTER WHAT. SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE THE ONE
604,00:37:03.87,00:37:03.87,ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK WHEN I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ESTABLISHED
605,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,SOME PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS AROUND HERE.
606,00:37:07.87,00:37:07.87,">> JEFF, I'VE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS HERE."
607,00:37:10.30,00:37:10.30,I HAVE ALL OF THEIR BACKS AND THEY KNOW IT.
608,00:37:12.97,00:37:12.97,"MONICA, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK."
609,00:37:15.57,00:37:15.57,">> OH, KAT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING MORE"
610,00:37:19.80,00:37:19.80,THAN I WANT TO DO THAN TRUST YOU AND I SERVED IT UP ON A SILVER
611,00:37:25.97,00:37:25.97,"PLATTER A FEW TIMES TRUSTING. AND IN THE END, I EVEN HEARD"
612,00:37:29.40,00:37:29.40,"YOU'VE THROWN MY NAME AROUND. >> Jeff: KAT, DO YOU THINK"
613,00:37:32.03,00:37:32.03,YOU'RE GOING HOME TONIGHT? >> I HOPE I DON'T.
614,00:37:33.77,00:37:33.77,I WANT TO STAY. AND YOU GUYS KNOW HOW MUCH I
615,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,"WANT TO STAY. PLEASE, BECAUSE I WILL DO"
616,00:37:40.93,00:37:40.93,ANYTHING. >> Jeff: WHO SHOULD BE GOING
617,00:37:42.37,00:37:42.37,HOME? >> I FEEL LIKE THE WOMEN SHOULD
618,00:37:43.97,00:37:43.97,"STICK TOGETHER LIKE OUR PLAN WAS FROM THE GET-GO, AND VOTE OUT"
619,00:37:48.73,00:37:48.73,"VYTAS. >> JEFF, I HEAR A LOT OF ""I'M"
620,00:37:51.43,00:37:51.43,"SORPRY."" SHE'S OBVIOUSLY MADE SOME"
621,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,"MISTAKES IN BUILDING TRUST WITH HER PARTNERS, BUT I HAVEN'T MADE"
622,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,ANYONE TO ANYONE HERE-- >> WE WON'T KNOW THAT.
623,00:37:58.50,00:37:58.50,>> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE FIVE STRONG GOING INTO THE MERGE
624,00:38:02.07,00:38:02.07,IF ONE PERSON HAS DEMONSTRATED ALREADY THAT THEY CAN'T BE
625,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,TRUSTED. >> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
626,00:38:06.93,00:38:06.93,AND JUST BECAUSE VYTAS COMES IN AND HE'S GENUINE TO EVERYBODY
627,00:38:09.87,00:38:09.87,"FOR 24 HOURS, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING."
628,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,"BUT YOU DO KNOW I WILL STAY HERE, AND I LOVE THESE PEOPLE,"
629,00:38:15.37,00:38:15.37,"AND THEY KNOW THAT. >> Jeff: TINA, ONE SIDE SAYS"
630,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,"STICK WITH YOUR ALLIANCE, DON'T LET THE OUTSIDERS IN."
631,00:38:22.07,00:38:22.07,THE OTHER SAYS TWO NEW PEOPLE? CHANCE TO BREAK THINGS UP.
632,00:38:24.93,00:38:24.93,">> YEAH, WELL FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE I"
633,00:38:27.57,00:38:27.57,HAVE A LOVED ONE OVER HERE NOW. THAT PUTS A WHOLE NEW DYNAMIC ON
634,00:38:31.77,00:38:31.77,"THINGS. AND SO, I HAVE TO MAKE MY"
635,00:38:34.23,00:38:34.23,DECISION BASED ON WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO GET ME FURTHER
636,00:38:38.90,00:38:38.90,TONIGHT AND POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE.
637,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,">> Jeff: SO, VYTAS, HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE IT ISN'T YOU TONIGHT?"
638,00:38:44.40,00:38:44.40,">> ALL I CAN REALLY DO IS COME IN HERE AND JUST BE OPEN, BE A"

640,00:38:52.30,00:38:52.30,AND THAT'S IT. THE REST IS LEFT FOR THEM TO
641,00:38:55.13,00:38:55.13,"JUDGE AND SAY OKAY, DO WE BUY THIS GUY?"
642,00:38:58.17,00:38:58.17,CAN WE TRUST HIM? OR DO WE JUST STICK WITH WHAT WE
643,00:39:02.80,00:39:02.80,"HAVE? >> Jeff: KAT, WE'RE JUST GO"

650,00:39:22.67,00:39:22.67,GOT CAUGHT THROWING PEOPLE'S NAMES OUT.
651,00:39:24.50,00:39:24.50,"PLEASE, I WILL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN."
