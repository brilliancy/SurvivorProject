379,00:24:10.27,00:24:10.27,"AND I'M THINKING WHOA, WHOA, WHOA."
380,00:24:12.30,00:24:12.30,WE WANT HER TO COME WITH US. WE DON'T WANT HER TO HATE
381,00:24:14.77,00:24:14.77,US. >> I DISAGREE WITH TINA AS
382,00:24:17.53,00:24:17.53,FAR AS THE JURY MEMBERS FEEL BUT.

384,00:24:21.27,00:24:21.27,BUT YOU WON THREE CHALLENGES.
385,00:24:23.00,00:24:23.00,YOU PLAYED AN AMAZING SOCIAL GAME.
386,00:24:24.70,00:24:24.70,AND THEN AT THE VERY END TO BE LIKE YOU THOUGHT HE
387,00:24:28.10,00:24:28.10,"HAD-- NO, THIS IS PART OF MY GAME AND I THINK YOU COULD"
388,00:24:30.53,00:24:30.53,"POTENTIALLY WIN. >> I KNOW MONICA, AND I KNOW"
389,00:24:32.27,00:24:32.27,THAT YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO MONICA'S EGO.
390,00:24:34.63,00:24:34.63,YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
391,00:24:36.40,00:24:36.40,YOU NEED TO BE NICE TO MONICA.
392,00:24:38.77,00:24:38.77,WE WANT MONICA TO FEEL LIKE SHE'S MAKING THE DECISION ON
393,00:24:41.83,00:24:41.83,"HER OWN, NOT BECAUSE WE ARE DESPERATE AND WANT HER TO"
394,00:24:44.23,00:24:44.23,TAKE US TO FINAL THREE. >> TO MAKE A MOVE AT THIS
395,00:24:46.27,00:24:46.27,POINT AGAINST TYSON AND GERVASE WOULD BE EPIC.
396,00:24:48.97,00:24:48.97,>> SURE. >> AND IF YOU DON'T EVER
397,00:24:50.07,00:24:50.07,"MAKE A MOVE, THE JURY WILL NEVER VOTE FOR YOU."

402,00:25:10.37,00:25:10.37,GERVASE. I GOT A LOT OF SORTING OUT
403,00:25:12.50,00:25:12.50,TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION
404,00:25:14.53,00:25:14.53,I'M GOING TO GO. BUT THIS IS A BRUTAL GAME.
405,00:25:28.90,00:25:28.90,">> Jeff: GOOD MORNING, GUYS! FINAL FIVE."

427,00:27:07.77,00:27:07.77,"RESTACK, THEN GO GET IT AGAIN."
428,00:27:10.17,00:27:10.17,PART OF THE LEARNING CURVE OF THIS CHALLENGE IS GOING
429,00:27:12.67,00:27:12.67,TO BE HOW FAST CAN I PULL. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SPOT
430,00:27:16.97,00:27:16.97,BETWEEN BRAZ ENAND RECKLES RECKLESS-- BRAZEN AND
431,00:27:20.67,00:27:20.67,RECKLESS. THE WOMEN ARE DOING GREAT
432,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,"OUT OF THE GATE, THE GUYS STRUGGLING."
433,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,"TYSON HAS HIS SECOND BLOCK, GERVASE LOOKING FOR HIS"

437,00:27:40.57,00:27:40.57,MONICA WITH HER FOURTH. TINA RIGHT THERE WITH HER
438,00:27:44.37,00:27:44.37,FOURTH. CIERA HAS FOUR.
439,00:27:46.67,00:27:46.67,"TINA HAS FOUR, MONICA HAS FOUR, AND TYSON HAS FOUR."
440,00:27:51.83,00:27:51.83,MONICA DROPS ALL FOUR OF HERS.
441,00:27:53.87,00:27:53.87,SHE'S GOT TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK.
442,00:27:56.20,00:27:56.20,THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR TINA TO BE IN THE LEAD.
443,00:28:00.07,00:28:00.07,TINA DROPS ALL FOUR OF HERS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING
444,00:28:03.53,00:28:03.53,ABOUT BETWEEN BRAZEN AND RECKLESS.
445,00:28:06.67,00:28:06.67,YOU WANT TO BE FAST BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE OUT OF
446,00:28:09.57,00:28:09.57,CONTROL. EVERYBODY IS STARTING TO
447,00:28:10.93,00:28:10.93,REALIZE HOW SENSITIVE THIS UNBALANCED TABLE IS.
448,00:28:16.03,00:28:16.03,TINA CAN'T EVEN GET AFOOT AWAY FROM THEM.
449,00:28:18.73,00:28:18.73,MONICA NOW HAS FIVE. CIERA NOW HAS FIVE.
450,00:28:21.80,00:28:21.80,TYSON IN THE LEAD WITH SIX. TINA DUMPS HERS AGAIN.
451,00:28:28.33,00:28:28.33,"YOU SEE IT HAPPENING, YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S TOO LATE,"
452,00:28:30.73,00:28:30.73,WHEN THAT TABLE TILTS TOO MUCH.
453,00:28:32.77,00:28:32.77,IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A MOMENT BEFORE YOUR BLOCKS
454,00:28:35.23,00:28:35.23,FALL BEHIND. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS.
455,00:28:37.73,00:28:37.73,THERE IS STILL A LOT OF CHALLENGE LEFT.
456,00:28:40.50,00:28:40.50,YOU HAVE TO GET TEN PLACED. TYSON HAS THREE EMPTY SPOTS
457,00:28:44.60,00:28:44.60,LEFT ON THAT TABLE. THAT'S ALL THAT STANDS
458,00:28:47.17,00:28:47.17,BETWEEN HIM AND A SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR.
459,00:28:49.53,00:28:49.53,HE GETS A BREAK WHEN CIERA DAMPS-- DUMPS ALL SIX OF HER
460,00:28:54.00,00:28:54.00,BLOCKS. MONICA COMING BACK WITH HER
461,00:28:56.27,00:28:56.27,SEVENTH BLOCK. TYSON COMING CLOSER NOW WITH
462,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,HIS EIGHTH. HE'S BEEN VERY STEADY.
463,00:29:03.57,00:29:03.57,TYSON HAS GOT TWO LEFT. MONICA HAS THREE LEFT.
464,00:29:06.97,00:29:06.97,GERVASE HAS THREE LEFT. CIERA PLACES HER SEVENTH
465,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,BLOCK. TINA DUMPS THEM ALL.
466,00:29:15.80,00:29:15.80,HAS GOT TO RESET EVERYTHING. MONICA HAS HER EIGHTH.
467,00:29:21.23,00:29:21.23,GERVASE HAS HIS EIGHTH. GERVASE AND MONICA ARE GOING
468,00:29:24.43,00:29:24.43,TO HAVE TO HOPE TYSON SCREWS UP.
469,00:29:27.07,00:29:27.07,TYSON COMING BACK WITH HIS NINTH.
470,00:29:29.27,00:29:29.27,TYSON HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT. CIERA NOT GIVING UP.
471,00:29:33.47,00:29:33.47,SHE'S STARTING TO MOVE A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY.
472,00:29:35.57,00:29:35.57,AND IN DOING SO SHE DUMPS EVERYTHING.
473,00:29:37.60,00:29:37.60,"MONICA DUMPS ALL OF HERS, GERVASE DUMPS ALL OF HIS,"
474,00:29:41.33,00:29:41.33,GERVASE AND MONICA HAVE TO RESET ALL THEIR BLOCKS AND
475,00:29:44.07,00:29:44.07,THAT GIVES TYSON THE SPACE HE NEEDS TO REALLY TAKE HIS
476,00:29:47.47,00:29:47.47,TIME. TYSON HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT.
477,00:29:49.83,00:29:49.83,AND HE'S INCHING CLOSER AND CLOSER.
478,00:29:52.23,00:29:52.23,IF HE CAN JUST KEEP THAT TABLE STEADY.
479,00:29:57.30,00:29:57.30,TINA DUMPS HERS AGAIN. SHE'S GOT TO COME BACK.
480,00:30:01.07,00:30:01.07,MONICA DUMPS HERS AGAIN. SHE'S GOING FOR BROKE.
481,00:30:04.17,00:30:04.17,THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. GERVASE WAS ALMOST THERE
482,00:30:07.17,00:30:07.17,WITH HIS NINTH. EVERYTHING FALLS.
483,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,TYSON GETTING CLOSER WITH THAT TENTH AND FINAL BLOCK.
484,00:30:12.37,00:30:12.37,"HE PLACES IT FOR A COUNT OF THREE, TWO, ONE."
485,00:30:16.63,00:30:16.63,TYSON WINS IMMUNITY AN A GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
486,00:30:20.83,00:30:20.83,"FOUR! >> GOOD JOB, TY, GOOD JOB."
487,00:30:33.43,00:30:33.43,">> GOOD JOB, BROTHER. >> COME ON OVER, TYSON."
488,00:30:39.27,00:30:39.27,>> SHOULD I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING KNIGHTED?

496,00:31:01.27,00:31:01.27,TO CAMP. SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
497,00:31:03.97,00:31:03.97,CONGRATS. >> I NEVER REALLY IMAGINED
498,00:31:05.70,00:31:05.70,MYSELF IN THIS POSITION WITH IMMUNITY ON DAY 37.
499,00:31:08.60,00:31:08.60,BUT I'M NOT GOING TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT
500,00:31:11.13,00:31:11.13,DONE. WHAT I NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW
501,00:31:13.63,00:31:13.63,IS HOW THE NEXT ONE IS GOING TO GO.
502,00:31:34.33,00:31:34.33," >> GOOD JOB, TYSON."
503,00:31:36.13,00:31:36.13,"I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. >> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY."

505,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE AND THE
506,00:31:45.37,00:31:45.37,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO
507,00:31:48.13,00:31:48.13,KEEP THIS IDOL AS A SOUVENIR AND GIVE IT TO RACHEL.
508,00:31:52.77,00:31:52.77,>> I LIKE THE GETTING ON ONE KNEE AND BEING KNIGHTED.
509,00:31:55.53,00:31:55.53,>> IT FEELS GOOD. I CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT

511,00:31:59.97,00:31:59.97,WE VOTE OUT TONIGHT. >> I THINK-- SHE CAN'T WIN.
512,00:32:13.63,00:32:13.63,>> YOU THINK THE SMARTEST MOVE DID TO GET RID OF TINA
513,00:32:16.03,00:32:16.03,TONIGHT OR CIERA TONIGHT. >> IF I HAD TO PICK WHO I

515,00:32:21.87,00:32:21.87,COULD BEAT TINA BEFORE I COULD BEAT CIERA.
516,00:32:23.90,00:32:23.90,>> S WHY'S THAT? >> BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE CIERA
517,00:32:27.97,00:32:27.97,MADE THE BIGGEST MOVE IN THE GAME.
518,00:32:30.03,00:32:30.03,SHE'S A YOUNG MOTHER WHO HAS NEVER WON BEFORE.
519,00:32:33.43,00:32:33.43,>> OUR ALLIANCE IS DEBATING TINA VERSUS CIERA RIGHT NOW.
520,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,AND I WILL PROBABLY LET GERVASE AND MONICA FIGURE IT
521,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,OUT AND GO WITH THEM. BECAUSE IT TAKES A LITTLE
522,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00,HEAT OFF ME. >> I THINK THAT TINA SHOULD
523,00:32:44.33,00:32:44.33,GO BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON THUS FAR SITTING ON
524,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"THE JURY IS OUT, NOT ONE OUT, BECAUSE OF HER THAT IS"
525,00:32:56.43,00:32:56.43,REALLY HARD TO BEAT AT THE END.
526,00:32:58.30,00:32:58.30,>> AT THIS POINT IT HAS TO BE --
527,00:33:00.33,00:33:00.33,>> I AGREE. IT HAS TO BE --
528,00:33:03.40,00:33:03.40,>> AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE TINA AND THEN I THOUGHT
529,00:33:06.33,00:33:06.33,MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF CIERA GOATS.
530,00:33:08.30,00:33:08.30,>> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS CHOICE.
531,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,I WANT YOU GUYS TO MAKE IT. >> IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
532,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,"TO ME, I SEE MERIT ON BOTH SIDES."
533,00:33:14.37,00:33:14.37,>> I WANT TINA TO GO HOME FIRST.
534,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13,I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR GAME THAT THE PERSON WITH
535,00:33:18.97,00:33:18.97,THE MOST FRIENDS ON THE JURY GOES HOME NOW.
536,00:33:22.37,00:33:22.37,>> I THINK CIERA IS A MORE DEADLY PLAYER IN THIS GAME.
537,00:33:26.13,00:33:26.13,I DO NOT TRUST HER. THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT SHE
538,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50,NEEDED TO GO. THE CHICK JUST LIES
539,00:33:30.53,00:33:30.53,CONSTANTLY AND SHE'S GOING IT TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO
540,00:33:32.30,00:33:32.30,WORM HER WAY INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS AND DO WHAT SHE HAS TO
541,00:33:35.03,00:33:35.03,DOMENT TINA DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAVVY TO DO IT.
542,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,>> I'M TIRED OF BEING BULLIED BY TINA.
543,00:33:39.47,00:33:39.47,"IT'S TIME FOR TINA TO GO. >> LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU"
544,00:33:42.60,00:33:42.60,"RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE DOING IT ON EMOTION."
545,00:33:44.63,00:33:44.63,">> THAT'S NOT TRUE. >> YOU JUST SAID IT, YOU ARE"
546,00:33:46.70,00:33:46.70,SICK AND TIRED OF TINA BULLYING YOU.
547,00:33:49.40,00:33:49.40,>> I'M TIRED OF HER BULLYING ME AND SHE IS THE ONLY
548,00:33:51.77,00:33:51.77,PERSON HERE THAT HASN'T VOTED ANYBODY ELSE OUT.
549,00:33:53.80,00:33:53.80,>> THAT IS NOT STRATEGY. >> I HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS
550,00:33:55.87,00:33:55.87,CRAP SHE IS SPEWING TO ME BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE.
551,00:33:58.30,00:33:58.30,I'M LIKE PUFFING MY CHEST UP RIGHT NOW TURNING INTO A
552,00:34:00.80,00:34:00.80,"BULLY LEANING IN ON HER LIKE WOMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?"
553,00:34:03.40,00:34:03.40,>> CIERA-- VOTED OUT HER MOTHER.
554,00:34:06.53,00:34:06.53,>> HER MOTHER IS GOING TO GIVE HER THE VOTE NO MATTER
555,00:34:08.67,00:34:08.67,WHAT. >> SHE WROTE HER MOTHER'S
556,00:34:10.40,00:34:10.40,NAME. I GIVE THAT MORE CREDIT THAN
557,00:34:12.00,00:34:12.00,ANYTHING. THAT IS A PLAYER IN THIS
558,00:34:14.70,00:34:14.70,GAME. >> I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD
559,00:34:17.43,00:34:17.43,ABOUT IT. >> I'VE BEEN BULLIED AND

1026,01:05:37.77,01:05:37.77,WOULD HAVE WON. SO THAT'S KIND OF HARD.
1027,01:05:39.77,01:05:39.77,BUT AT THE SAME TIME SURVIVOR NEVER CEASES TO
1028,01:05:43.57,01:05:43.57,DELIVER AN ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME.

1058,01:07:52.13,01:07:52.13,TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY I LEFT IT.
1059,01:07:54.60,01:07:54.60,AND I ENDED UP IN THE FINALS.
1060,01:07:56.60,01:07:56.60,THAT'S NOT LUCK. THAT'S NOT CHANCE.
1061,01:07:58.73,01:07:58.73,THAT'S BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.

1085,01:09:44.37,01:09:44.37,WILL NOT MAKE IT TO THE FINALS.

1089,01:09:54.07,01:09:54.07,TYSON WASN'T CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IT WAS A

1091,01:09:59.87,01:09:59.87,GAME SHOULD BE PLAYED. I THINK SIT UNTIL THIS
1092,01:10:02.10,01:10:02.10,POSITION DEFINITELY WARRANTS YOUR VOTES TO BE THE SOLE
1093,01:10:04.47,01:10:04.47,SURVIVOR AND THE WINNER OF THIS GAME.

1095,01:10:09.03,01:10:09.03,START WITH ADDRESSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
1096,01:10:11.60,01:10:11.60,AND THAT IS I KNOW THAT YOU ALL THINK THAT I WAS DRUG
1097,01:10:15.03,01:10:15.03,ALONG LIKE A PUPPY DOG ON A LEEFERB LEASH BY THESE GUYS
1098,01:10:18.43,01:10:18.43,TO GET TO THE END. AND THAT'S NOT TRUE.
1099,01:10:21.83,01:10:21.83,I HAD THREE CHOICES IN THE LAST THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS
1100,01:10:24.93,01:10:24.93,"TO GO WITH KATIE, CIERA, HAYDEN AND TINA."
1101,01:10:28.30,01:10:28.30,AND I NEVER CHOOSE THAT PATH.
1102,01:10:31.13,01:10:31.13,"BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIT IN THE END WITH THESE GUYS,"
1103,01:10:34.87,01:10:34.87,BECAUSE I HAVE LESS BLOOD ON MY HANDS AND LESS BROKEN
1104,01:10:38.27,01:10:38.27,PROMISES. AND IF I WOULD HAVE SAT WITH
1105,01:10:40.33,01:10:40.33,"HAYDEN, KATIE, CIERA OR TINA, I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE"
1106,01:10:44.07,01:10:44.07,YOU. AND SO MY STRATEGIC PLAY
1107,01:10:46.10,01:10:46.10,GAVE ME THE BEST CHANCE TO WIN.
1108,01:10:47.87,01:10:47.87,I HOPE THAT THAT FINDS SOME MERIT IN YOUR VOTE.
1109,01:10:51.27,01:10:51.27,AND I AM PROUD OF THE SOCIAL MANEUVERING AND THINGS THAT
1110,01:10:54.27,01:10:54.27,I'VE DONE TO GET HERE. >> Jeff: TYSON.
1111,01:10:59.73,01:10:59.73,>> I CAME INTO THIS GAME KNOWING I WOULD PROBABLY BE

1113,01:11:06.63,01:11:06.63,CONFIRMED THAT AS I HIT THE GALANG BEACH.
1114,01:11:09.03,01:11:09.03,AND SO I SAID I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF

1116,01:11:15.23,01:11:15.23,GOING TO GET VOTED OUT. THAT CHANGED THE SECOND I

1118,01:11:22.67,01:11:22.67,"WHEN SHE LEFT I SAID I HAVE TO GET TO DAY 39, NO MATTER"
1119,01:11:26.20,01:11:26.20,"WHAT IT TAKES, I HAVE TO FOCUS EVERY DAY AND SHOW HER"
1120,01:11:30.17,01:11:30.17,"THAT I APPRECIATED HER SACRIFICE, KNOWING THAT THE"

1122,01:11:38.07,01:11:38.07,THOUGHT I WAS TOO BIG OF A THREAT SO YOU VOTED HER OUT.
1123,01:11:40.73,01:11:40.73,SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO. I MADE THE HUGE MOVES.
1124,01:11:43.77,01:11:43.77,"I DUG AROUND FOR THE IDOL, TO MAKE SURE NOBODY ELSE HAD"
1125,01:11:47.20,01:11:47.20,THEM. AND I WON CHALLENGES WHEN I
1126,01:11:49.93,01:11:49.93,ABSOLUTELY HAD TO. EVERYTHING I DID WAS
1127,01:11:51.97,01:11:51.97,"STRATEGIC, NOTHING WAS OUT OF MALICE."
1128,01:11:54.63,01:11:54.63,"AND I'M HERE, DAY 39 BECAUSE RACHEL MADE THAT SACRIFICE."
1129,01:12:00.87,01:12:00.87,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY, SOME OF YOU HAVE WAITED"

1139,01:12:47.93,01:12:47.93,IS TO GET BEFORE YOU GET GOT.
1140,01:12:49.50,01:12:49.50,"AND YOU DEFINITELY DID THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, I WASN'T"
1141,01:12:52.00,01:12:52.00,GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE END.
1142,01:12:53.30,01:12:53.30,ARAS WASN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE END.
1143,01:12:54.83,01:12:54.83,THAT IS THE POINT YOU MADE TO GET US BEFORE WE GOT YOU.
1144,01:12:59.60,01:12:59.60,THE PROBLEM IS MY LAST PLAY WAS TELLING YOU IF YOU GET
1145,01:13:02.93,01:13:02.93,"ME OUT, I PROMISE YOU I'M TO THE GOING TO GIVE YOU MY"
1146,01:13:05.93,01:13:05.93,"JURY VOTE, DOW REMEMBER THAT."

1148,01:13:08.33,01:13:08.33,"THAT. >> THAT WAS PIE LAST PLAY,"
1149,01:13:09.50,01:13:09.50,"MY LAST GROUND TO STAND ON. AND TO BE HONEST, I'M GOING"
1150,01:13:11.93,01:13:11.93,TO STICK TO THAT. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE TWO

1152,01:13:17.53,01:13:17.53,MEANS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADAPT.
1153,01:13:19.47,01:13:19.47,THIS GAME IS ABOUT ADAPTABILITY AND CHANGE AND
1154,01:13:21.80,01:13:21.80,"IT HAS MORPHED IN THE 13 YEARS TO PLAY, OLD SCHOOL"
1155,01:13:25.27,01:13:25.27,WORKS FOR FASHION AND WORKS FOR MUSIC SOMETIMES BUT IT
1156,01:13:27.33,01:13:27.33,DOESN'T WORK IN SURVIVOR. YOU LINKED UP WITH A NEW
1157,01:13:30.70,01:13:30.70,SCHOOL PLAYER. IN MY OPINION HE KIND OF
1158,01:13:32.93,01:13:32.93,"CARRIED YOU THROUGH, SO I DON'T NEED TO YOU SAY"
1159,01:13:34.83,01:13:34.83,"ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. AND THEN WITH MONICA, WHO"
1160,01:13:38.27,01:13:38.27,"WHEN THAT TRIBE SWAP HAPPENED, THERE WAS A"
1161,01:13:41.67,01:13:41.67,GENUINE FRIENDSHIP WE HAD. AND I TOTALLY TRUSD NEW THAT
1162,01:13:45.07,01:13:45.07,SENSE. THESE GUYS NEVER PROMISED ME
1163,01:13:46.43,01:13:46.43,SOMETHING. THEY PROMISED MY BROTHER
1164,01:13:47.77,01:13:47.77,"SOMETHING, BUT ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE HERE THAT TURNED ON"
1165,01:13:49.80,01:13:49.80,ME. LIKE YOU AN I HAD A
1166,01:13:52.20,01:13:52.20,FRIENDSHIP AND YOU NEVER CAME AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT
1167,01:13:54.57,01:13:54.57,THAT AND HONORED THAT FRIENDSHIP AM.
1168,01:13:56.60,01:13:56.60,SO I DON'T KNOW WHO TO VOTE FOR.
1169,01:13:58.70,01:13:58.70,I'M JUST GOING TO BE WATCHING WHAT GOES DOWN AS
1170,01:14:01.17,01:14:01.17,THESE OTHER GUYS ASK YOU QUESTIONS TONIGHT AND HOW IT
1171,01:14:03.53,01:14:03.53,"GOES. >> THANKS, VYTAS."
1172,01:14:04.90,01:14:04.90,">> THANKS, VYTAS. >> Jeff: KATIE, YOU'RE UP."
1173,01:14:09.27,01:14:09.27,>> HI. I WANT TO SAY
1174,01:14:11.03,01:14:11.03,CONGRATULATIONS TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
1175,01:14:13.33,01:14:13.33,I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR TYSON.
1176,01:14:15.43,01:14:15.43,IN YOUR OPENING SPEECH YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
1177,01:14:18.20,01:14:18.20,OUT OF MALICE. AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN WE
1178,01:14:22.23,01:14:22.23,ALL DREW BETWEEN ME AND CIERA IT WAS ONE OF THE
1179,01:14:25.33,01:14:25.33,LOWEST MOMENTS FOR ME WHEN I HELD OUT THE WHITE ROCK AND
1180,01:14:28.03,01:14:28.03,I SAW YOU STAND UP TO HUG ME.
1181,01:14:30.03,01:14:30.03,"BUT THEN YOU LOOKED AT ME IN THE EYES AND YOU SAID, YOU"
1182,01:14:34.07,01:14:34.07,"SEE THAT JURY SEAT OVER THERE, THAT'S YOURS."
1183,01:14:36.43,01:14:36.43,AND DID YOU IT OUT OF MALICE.
1184,01:14:37.83,01:14:37.83,">> YEAH, THAT WAS THE ONE THING I REGRETTED DOING IN"
1185,01:14:40.60,01:14:40.60,THE GAME. I WAS HOPING TO HAVE THE
1186,01:14:42.23,01:14:42.23,CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR THAT.
1187,01:14:43.90,01:14:43.90,">> I MEAN IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR"
1188,01:14:47.20,01:14:47.20,TYSON AFTER A STATEMENT LIKE THAT?
1189,01:14:49.30,01:14:49.30,>> IT'S HARD BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE BEGIN GUNNING FOR
1190,01:14:52.10,01:14:52.10,ME. THE DRAWING ROCK THING WAS A
1191,01:14:53.77,01:14:53.77,REAL STUFF SPOT FOR ME. MY HEART WAS BEATING.
1192,01:14:55.67,01:14:55.67,"COY HEAR IT IN MY FACE, AND WITH ME SOMETIMES MY MOUTH"
1193,01:14:58.70,01:14:58.70,TAKES OVER BEFORE MY BRAIN CAN STOP IT AND SAYS THAT'S
1194,01:15:02.20,01:15:02.20,KATIE. I WOULD HOPE YOU COULD LOOK
1195,01:15:03.60,01:15:03.60,PAST IT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT I WOULD BE A BIG ENOUGH
1196,01:15:06.30,01:15:06.30,PERSON TO LOOK PAST IT AND VOTE FOR THE PERSON THAT YOU
1197,01:15:08.43,01:15:08.43,"FEEL PLAYED THE BEST GAME. I WOULD HOPE COY DO THAT,"
1198,01:15:11.10,01:15:11.10,BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY THAT I WOULD.
1199,01:15:16.57,01:15:16.57,>> THANKS KATIE. >> THANK YOU.
1200,01:15:17.90,01:15:17.90,">> AND SORRY ABOUT THAT, KATIE, I REALLY AM, IT IS MY"
1201,01:15:21.30,01:15:21.30,ONE REGRET OF THE GAME. >> THANK YOU.
1202,01:15:26.40,01:15:26.40,">> Jeff: CALEB, YOU'RE UP. >> HI, Y'ALL."
1203,01:15:30.50,01:15:30.50,"MY QUESTION IS TO YOU, GERVASE."
1204,01:15:33.13,01:15:33.13,WHAT WAS YOUR BIG GAME-CHANGING MOVE?
1205,01:15:35.93,01:15:35.93,>> I THINK MY BIGGEST MOVE OF THE GAME WAS VOTING OUT
1206,01:15:38.30,01:15:38.30,ARAS. I KNOW EVERYBODY THINKS
1207,01:15:40.07,01:15:40.07,TYSON MAKES THE MOVE BUT HERE IS THE THING WITH MY
1208,01:15:42.43,01:15:42.43,PLAYING STYLE. I WAS NEVER THE TARGET.
1209,01:15:44.13,01:15:44.13,"YES, I WANTED TYSON'S TEAM LIKE HE WAS PULLING THE"
1210,01:15:48.23,01:15:48.23,TRIGGER AND ALL THESE MOVES BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO VOTE
1211,01:15:50.67,01:15:50.67,"OUT WHO, TYSON. I THINK THAT'S GENIUS."
1212,01:15:54.10,01:15:54.10,HE'S TAKING ALL THE HEAT. BUT A LOT OF THE MOVES THAT
1213,01:15:56.53,01:15:56.53,HAPPENED IN THIS GAME CAME FROM ME.
1214,01:15:58.53,01:15:58.53,">> I APPRECIATE IT. MONICA, FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE"
1215,01:16:01.07,01:16:01.07,YOU JUST HAVE THAT PERFECT PERSONA ABOUT YOU AND YOU
1216,01:16:04.10,01:16:04.10,"KNOW, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING FROM YOU."
1217,01:16:07.53,01:16:07.53,BE VULNERABLE. TELL ME SOMETHING INSTEAD OF
1218,01:16:10.37,01:16:10.37,FROM UP HERE I NEED YOU TO ANSWER FROM IN HERE.
1219,01:16:12.97,01:16:12.97,"YOU KNOW, LIKE FROM THE HEART."
1220,01:16:16.63,01:16:16.63,">> MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT BRAD, AND NINE YEARS"
1221,01:16:20.87,01:16:20.87,IN THE NFL. AND I WANT THIS.
1222,01:16:24.13,01:16:24.13,"IT'S NEVER, EVER, EVER IN THE LAST 21 YEARS, ONE DAY,"
1223,01:16:29.23,01:16:29.23,BEEN ABOUT ME. AND TODAY IT IS.
1224,01:16:32.60,01:16:32.60,AND I'M PROUD OF ME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL ARE
1225,01:16:35.37,01:16:35.37,PROUD OF ME OR NOT. I HAVEN'T HAD A FRIEND OUT
1226,01:16:38.40,01:16:38.40,HERE. I FELT LIKE I'VE BEEN THE
1227,01:16:40.83,01:16:40.83,LONELY HEART FROM THE MINUTE BRAD WALKED OUT THAT DOOR.
1228,01:16:43.57,01:16:43.57,AND I STAYED. AND I FOUGHT.
1229,01:16:45.60,01:16:45.60,"AND I SAID WHAT IS YOUR GOAL HERE, WOMAN."
1230,01:16:48.33,01:16:48.33,AND IT IS TO GET TO THE END. AND IT'S NOT TO JUST GET TO
1231,01:16:52.13,01:16:52.13,"THE END, IT'S TO GET TO THE END AND WIN AND HAVE SOME"
1232,01:16:55.57,01:16:55.57,"SORT OF BADGE OF HONOR FOR MONICA, ME, OTHER THAN"
1233,01:17:00.90,01:17:00.90,"BRAD'S WIFE, AND HONOR'S MOM."
1234,01:17:05.53,01:17:05.53,AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. >> I APPRECIATE IT.
1235,01:17:09.47,01:17:09.47,"GOOD LUCK, YOU GUYS. >> Jeff: THANKS, CALEB."
1236,01:17:14.13,01:17:14.13,"I CIERA, YOU'RE UP. >> HI, GUYS."
1237,01:17:20.63,01:17:20.63,"TYSON, I OBVIOUSLY TITLED YOU THE VILLAIN."
1238,01:17:24.07,01:17:24.07,SO I WANT TO KNOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS THE VILLAIN OR
1239,01:17:27.80,01:17:27.80,AS THE HERO. >> I HONESTLY DON'T SEE
1240,01:17:30.90,01:17:30.90,MYSELF AS THE VILLAIN. LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING
1241,01:17:33.63,01:17:33.63,"STATEMENT, EVERY MOVE I MADE WAS STRATEGIC."
1242,01:17:36.03,01:17:36.03,IT WASN'T EVER PERSONAL. IT WASN'T EVER OUT OF
1243,01:17:39.10,01:17:39.10,DISLIKE FOR ANYONE. EVERYTHING CAME DOWN TO HOW
1244,01:17:42.30,01:17:42.30,"MANY NUMBERS DOES THIS PERSON HAVE, WHERE DO THEY"
1245,01:17:44.87,01:17:44.87,"FIT IN THEIR ALLIANCE, WHOSE'S THE STRONGEST"
1246,01:17:47.30,01:17:47.30,"SOCIALLY, IS SOMEBODY GOING TO BEAT ME IN A CHALLENGE"
1247,01:17:49.97,01:17:49.97,DOWN THE ROAD. EVERYTHING I DID WAS PURE
1248,01:17:52.00,01:17:52.00,"STRATEGY. AND FOR THAT REASON, I WOULD"
1249,01:17:54.13,01:17:54.13,SAY I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE VILLAIN.
1250,01:17:56.77,01:17:56.77,"A HERO, RACHEL CONSIDERS ME A HERO."
1251,01:17:59.57,01:17:59.57,AND I GUESS FUR'S NOT THE VILLAIN THAN YOU HAVE TO BE
1252,01:18:02.57,01:18:02.57,"THE HERO. >> OKAY, THANKS, TYSON."
1253,01:18:05.80,01:18:05.80,"GERVASE, WERE YOU EVER GOING TO VOTE OUT TYSON?"
1254,01:18:08.20,01:18:08.20,>> MY PLAN WAS TO DO IT AT THE RIGHT TIME.
1255,01:18:10.60,01:18:10.60,AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING AT A FINAL FOUR SPOT TO GET RID
1256,01:18:14.00,01:18:14.00,"OF TYSON. AT THAT TIME IN THE GAME, I"
1257,01:18:16.07,01:18:16.07,"JUST FELT LIKE IF I JOINED YOU GUYS, AND WE GOT RID OF"
1258,01:18:19.70,01:18:19.70,TYSON I ABSOLUTELY WAS GOING TO BE NEXT TO GO.
1259,01:18:22.83,01:18:22.83,AND MY BEST ODDS AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME WERE TO STAY
1260,01:18:25.70,01:18:25.70,WITH TYSON AND RIDE IT OUT. AND IF I SAT HERE NEXT TO
1261,01:18:28.67,01:18:28.67,"HIM AND LOST, IT'S OKAY. BECAUSE I MADE THAT"
1262,01:18:31.13,01:18:31.13,DECISION. I FEEL LIKE I CAN DEFINITELY
1263,01:18:32.93,01:18:32.93,BEAT TYSON AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO MAKE THAT MOVE
1264,01:18:35.90,01:18:35.90,AND COME HERE TONIGHT. >> OKAY.
1265,01:18:37.60,01:18:37.60,THAT'S ALL I GOT FOR YOU GUYS.
1266,01:18:39.63,01:18:39.63,">> THANKS, CIERA. >> Jeff: LAURA, YOU'RE UP."
1267,01:18:47.50,01:18:47.50,"OKAY, SO MONICA, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE."
1268,01:18:50.90,01:18:50.90,LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS HARD FOR ME
1269,01:18:55.33,01:18:55.33,IS I CAN SOMETIMES BE REALLY PRICKLY AND BE REALLY HARD
1270,01:18:58.43,01:18:58.43,TO BE AROUND. AND I NEED TO WORK ON THAT.
1271,01:19:02.20,01:19:02.20,"OKAY, THAT'S BEING VULNERABLE AND THAT'S SAYING"
1272,01:19:05.00,01:19:05.00,"OKAY, I'M GOING TO JUST STRIP MY CLOTHES OFF."
1273,01:19:07.67,01:19:07.67,HERE IS AN UGLYNESS ABOUT MYSELF.
1274,01:19:09.57,01:19:09.57,>> I THINK ALL MY UGLINESSES HAVE BEEN SHOWN ON THIS
1275,01:19:13.40,01:19:13.40,GAME. >> TELL ME WHAT.
1276,01:19:14.93,01:19:14.93,">> IF YOU ARE CLASSIC CULPEPPER, A LOT OF TIMES I"
1277,01:19:19.87,01:19:19.87,THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT MONICA YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF
1278,01:19:21.90,01:19:21.90,"PLACE IN THIS GAME. >> WHY, WHAT MAKES YOU OUT"
1279,01:19:24.03,01:19:24.03,OF PLACE. >> PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A
1280,01:19:26.40,01:19:26.40,"PUPPY DOG, PEOPLE SAY ARE YOU BEING DRUG AROUND."
1281,01:19:29.73,01:19:29.73,PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE SAY YOU TALK TOO
1282,01:19:31.50,01:19:31.50,MUCH. PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T LIKE
1283,01:19:32.87,01:19:32.87,YOUR STORIES. PEOPLE SAY MONICA ONLY TELLS
1284,01:19:35.97,01:19:35.97,STORIES ABOUT HER FAMILY BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
1285,01:19:37.77,01:19:37.77,INTERESTING ABOUT MONICA. >> HOW DOES THAT NOT
1286,01:19:40.37,01:19:40.37,DEVASTATE YOU AND BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES IN THIS GAME.
1287,01:19:42.70,01:19:42.70,">> IT DID, NUMEROUS TIMES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?"
1288,01:19:45.77,01:19:45.77,I'VE GROWN OUT HERE. AND I LET ALL OF THOSE
1289,01:19:48.20,01:19:48.20,EMOTIONS GO AWAY. AND I FOUGHT.
1290,01:19:49.83,01:19:49.83,"I WIN A CHALLENGE, ALL LITTLE 100 POUNDS OF ME IS"
1291,01:19:53.10,01:19:53.10,"FREAKING HE MASS YATED. I'M EATING GRUBS, WORMS, PIG"
