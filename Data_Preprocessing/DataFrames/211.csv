366,00:27:27.27,00:27:27.27,"I mean, but I'm just, like,shaking and weak, and I'm just"
367,00:27:35.13,00:27:35.13,frustrated with how I feel.I couldn't even walk up the hill
368,00:27:38.77,00:27:38.77,"to fish.I mean, I hate not being able to"
369,00:27:41.57,00:27:41.57,help out and get some food.We need to get rice today.
370,00:27:55.20,00:27:55.20,"I just want my strength back.I'm just nauseous and, like,..."
371,00:28:00.33,00:28:00.33,"oh, man.>> NICK: It's hard to get"
372,00:28:03.00,00:28:03.00,started in the morning.>> ELISABETH: Yeah.
373,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,We have nothing to sustain usthrough the morning today.
374,00:28:12.07,00:28:12.07,We're praying for fish.We have only two hooks right
375,00:28:13.53,00:28:13.53,now.>> TINA: No luck.
376,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,Not even any bites.Rodger got a turtle.
377,00:28:18.83,00:28:18.83,">> RODGER: He pulled the hookoff, so there goes another hook."
378,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,>> ELISABETH: I'm sorry Icouldn't make it out here
379,00:28:24.37,00:28:24.37,sooner.I just had a rough morning.
380,00:28:27.47,00:28:27.47,">> RODGER: Why don't you comeback and rest, and then we're"
381,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,going to go back out in a coupleof hours.
382,00:28:31.33,00:28:31.33,>> ELISABETH: Okay.>> RODGER: Only bite I had was
383,00:28:33.03,00:28:33.03,that stupid turtle.>> ELISABETH: I'm just real low.
384,00:28:51.93,00:28:51.93,">> RODGER: Yeah, Jeff's here.He's got a big thing of rice."
385,00:28:57.73,00:28:57.73,>> TINA: He has a bad look onhis face.

387,00:29:07.90,00:29:07.90,">> JEFF: I come today becauseI'm concerned, because yesterday"
388,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,"at the immunity challenge, I sawsomething that I haven't seen"
389,00:29:15.47,00:29:15.47,"before-- true lethargy, a reallack of energy, especially with"
390,00:29:19.40,00:29:19.40,Elisabeth and Nick.You've got 13 days left.
391,00:29:24.40,00:29:24.40,And I don't think you're goingto make it.
392,00:29:26.80,00:29:26.80,"So it puts me in an awkwardsituation, because you had"
393,00:29:29.70,00:29:29.70,"plenty of stuff.If rationed properly, you had"
394,00:29:32.67,00:29:32.67,enough rice and you had 25hooks.
395,00:29:34.83,00:29:34.83,You had a tackle box youcouldn't improve on.
396,00:29:37.93,00:29:37.93,So what happened with the rice?I mean why are you out?
397,00:29:41.37,00:29:41.37,>> COLBY: We just weren'tcareful with our rations.
398,00:29:44.60,00:29:44.60,There's not any one person toblame.
399,00:29:45.80,00:29:45.80,"We're all guilty.>> TINA: We did each lose a bag,"
400,00:29:48.30,00:29:48.30,"too, to condensation in the can.>> COLBY: But that's our own"
401,00:29:49.97,00:29:49.97,fault.>> TINA: I'm not saying it's not
402,00:29:52.63,00:29:52.63,our fault.But you just asked what
403,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,"happened, and that's part ofwhat happened."
404,00:29:57.33,00:29:57.33,>> JEFF: Here's where we're at.My role is a giver and a taker.
405,00:30:01.27,00:30:01.27,Nothing comes cheap.I have enough rice to last you
406,00:30:06.97,00:30:06.97,your last two weeks here.>> AMBER: There's so much rice
407,00:30:09.87,00:30:09.87,there.>> JEFF: But it's not coming
408,00:30:12.60,00:30:12.60,"without a price, so I needsomething back."
409,00:30:15.53,00:30:15.53,"And I need something of value,substantial value to get this"
410,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,rice.>> RODGER: Blankets.
411,00:30:21.50,00:30:21.50,I think blankets would be a goodtradeoff.
412,00:30:22.97,00:30:22.97,">> JEFF: Rodger, I'm talkingserious value."
413,00:30:24.83,00:30:24.83,You guys are playing for...>> RODGER: You're laying there
414,00:30:27.23,00:30:27.23,"shivering some night, thoseblankets are of serious value."
415,00:30:29.67,00:30:29.67,>> JEFF: We're playing for $1million.
416,00:30:31.90,00:30:31.90,">> TINA: Of what we have, whatdo you want?"
417,00:30:33.50,00:30:33.50,>> JEFF: I'm talking camp.>> TINA: Camp? Our tent?
418,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,">> JEFF: Shelter versus food,it's one or the other."
419,00:30:43.07,00:30:43.07,Your tarps and that Texas flag.That's what I want.

421,00:30:49.37,00:30:49.37,>> ELISABETH: All the tarps?>> RODGER: How are we going to
422,00:30:51.53,00:30:51.53,keep dry when it rains?It rains every day.
423,00:30:53.30,00:30:53.30,">> TINA: We could use rainjackets, the top and the sleeve."
424,00:30:55.90,00:30:55.90,">> COLBY: I mean, shelter,though."
425,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,That's a no-brainer.I'm talking about my personal
426,00:30:59.47,00:30:59.47,item here.I have no problem giving it up.
427,00:31:02.47,00:31:02.47,>> JEFF: Let me entice you alittle more:
428,00:31:04.40,00:31:04.40,"25 more hooks.>> TINA: Oh, absolutely."
429,00:31:07.80,00:31:07.80,"You can have the shelter, as faras... my vote is take the"
430,00:31:09.77,00:31:09.77,shelter.>> ELISABETH: And if we have
431,00:31:11.73,00:31:11.73,"energy, we can build something.>> JEFF: Let's do it."
432,00:31:15.87,00:31:15.87,">> TINA: Thank you, Jeff.>> AMBER: Oh, my God."

440,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,>> COLBY: Thank you very much.>> JEFF: I hope the food gives
441,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,you the strength to rebuild...>> ELISABETH: It will.
442,00:31:54.43,00:31:54.43,>> JEFF: ...to get through thelast two weeks.

446,00:32:02.13,00:32:02.13,unfortunate business of dealingwith the tribal council.

448,00:32:15.63,00:32:15.63,">> COLBY: Once we realized that,oh, my God, our shelter's gone,"
449,00:32:17.97,00:32:17.97,the first thing we seemed tohave to do was get a roof over
450,00:32:20.10,00:32:20.10,our head 'cause it really seemedlike it was going to rain pretty
451,00:32:23.10,00:32:23.10,hard today.>> RODGER: It's going to be
452,00:32:25.07,00:32:25.07,pouring down rain here tonight.>> TINA: We need to start
453,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,"looking for a tree cover.>> COLBY: Actually, up in this"
454,00:32:29.80,00:32:29.80,thing would probably be the bestjust because there are so many
455,00:32:33.00,00:32:33.00,places to lay branches in here.>> TINA: The only downside is if
456,00:32:35.83,00:32:35.83,the river comes up again.I don't think we need to bring
457,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,the woods to us; I think we needto go to the woods.
458,00:32:39.70,00:32:39.70,>> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.>> KEITH: So then it was trying
459,00:32:43.07,00:32:43.07,to decide where the shelter wasgoing to be.
460,00:32:44.70,00:32:44.70,And we had a little food thismorning but not enough to climb
461,00:32:47.40,00:32:47.40,"with a hill and build a shelterup in the hills, that's for"
462,00:32:49.10,00:32:49.10,sure.>> RODGER: We want to come in
463,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,here with some limbs and anglethem down so it will run as much
464,00:33:03.33,00:33:03.33,water off as we can.>> TINA: I think it was a fair
465,00:33:06.83,00:33:06.83,"trade.If we can keep the rains away,"
466,00:33:11.33,00:33:11.33,as long as it's not a torrentialdownpour.
467,00:33:13.63,00:33:13.63,We may get wet.But there's worse things in life
468,00:33:18.60,00:33:18.60,"than being wet, such as starvingto death."
469,00:33:22.90,00:33:22.90,">> COLBY: Hey, Nick, can youbring some of that brush down?"
470,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,>> TINA: Think chopping up thischest is good?
471,00:33:32.73,00:33:32.73,We're using everything that wepossibly can at this point.
472,00:33:37.03,00:33:37.03,Every little bit helps.>> RODGER: I got some more.
473,00:33:46.00,00:33:46.00,>> NICK: All right.>> TINA: What do you need most
474,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,of right now?We got grass.
475,00:33:50.70,00:33:50.70,">> COLBY: I need grass and pine,that's it."
476,00:33:58.57,00:33:58.57,It's looking solid already.>> TINA: Maybe it won't even
477,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,rain tonight.>> COLBY: Maybe not.
478,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27,( thunder rumbling )>> TINA: Maybe so.
479,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,>> NICK: Maybe so.>> AMBER: I feel a couple of
480,00:34:10.00,00:34:10.00,raindrops.>> TINA: Might as well get used
481,00:34:15.13,00:34:15.13,to it.>> NICK: These branches are not
482,00:34:19.80,00:34:19.80,going to keep us totally dry.It's going to be more water-
483,00:34:23.10,00:34:23.10,"resistant than waterproof.>> RODGER: At least we got food,"
484,00:34:26.27,00:34:26.27,brother.>> COLBY: Amber's a little bit
485,00:34:42.63,00:34:42.63,nervous about the fact that wevoted Jerri off.
486,00:34:45.40,00:34:45.40,She felt like she might be thenext one that we go after.
487,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,That way Amber won't knowanything.
488,00:34:51.63,00:34:51.63,>> KEITH: A smart move.>> COLBY: It could be
489,00:34:54.43,00:34:54.43,potentially deadly for all threeof us.
490,00:34:57.13,00:34:57.13,>> AMBER: Can you help me carrythis?
491,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,>> COLBY: She and Elisabeth havebeen bonding quite well.
492,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,"She could very easily go overto the guys from Kucha and say,"
493,00:35:06.57,00:35:06.57,"""Hey, look, I know they're goingafter me next."
494,00:35:08.90,00:35:08.90,"I want to jump on with youguys."""

496,00:35:13.43,00:35:13.43,"I mean, if everyone can makeJerri go away, she can just as"
497,00:35:15.87,00:35:15.87,"easily go away.But by voting Jerri off, Ogakor"
498,00:35:25.40,00:35:25.40,diluted their power a bit.It didn't seem to be the
499,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"smartest strategic thing to do.>> AMBER: Okay, guys."
500,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40,">> ELISABETH: And, now, I thinkthey are worried about Amber"
501,00:35:38.47,00:35:38.47,approaching us.Amber is kind of a pivot in the
502,00:35:42.57,00:35:42.57,whole Barramundi scenario.Bon appétit.
503,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77,>> TINA: That is good rice.It's so nice to have rice again.
504,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,>> AMBER: I could approach theKucha people and go against
505,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87,"Colby, Tina and Keith.And it would be four against"
506,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40,three and we could just pickthem off one by one.
507,00:36:04.13,00:36:04.13,"But how do I know that I can100% trust the Kucha members,"
508,00:36:06.73,00:36:06.73,that they're not just playingwith my mind and just pretending
509,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,to agree with me?I guess I don't know if I can
510,00:36:11.70,00:36:11.70,"trust Ogakor people, too.They could be playing with my"
511,00:36:14.23,00:36:14.23,"mind, too, but I have to playthe game."
512,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,And the game's getting harderand harder as the days go on.
513,00:36:22.43,00:36:22.43,>> RODGER: We need to be headingout.
514,00:36:26.33,00:36:26.33,I guess we're ready.>> AMBER: Let's go.
515,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,">> RODGER: You're not bringinganything, Keith?"

525,00:37:24.73,00:37:24.73,it was fair.That was something that we could
526,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,rebuild.And even though you took it away
527,00:37:30.10,00:37:30.10,"from us, it's not like itcouldn't be replaced."
528,00:37:33.87,00:37:33.87,"And so, to be quite honest, Iwas grateful that that's what"

534,00:37:50.27,00:37:50.27,I was waving back and forth andfelt bad.
535,00:37:52.93,00:37:52.93,And the last three days havebeen so incredibly tough.
