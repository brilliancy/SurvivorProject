2,00:00:03.67,00:00:03.67,"Food was scarce, fishing was tough."

4,00:00:07.17,00:00:07.17,>> JEFF: And they were dangerously low on rice.
5,00:00:09.33,00:00:09.33,>> JERRI: One more meal of rice is all we have we have left?
6,00:00:11.77,00:00:11.77,>> TINA: At the most. >> JEFF: Jerri wanted to team up
7,00:00:14.20,00:00:14.20,"with Colby for the reward challenge, but the tribe"
8,00:00:16.63,00:00:16.63,insisted on drawing names from a hat.
9,00:00:18.00,00:00:18.00,"Ironically, she ended up with Colby anyway, and they went on"
10,00:00:21.37,00:00:21.37,"to win the event, and spent a day at the Great Barrier Reef."
11,00:00:26.23,00:00:26.23,>> JERRI: This is basically the perfect honeymoon without the
12,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03,sex. >> JEFF: Nick won the immunity
13,00:00:29.97,00:00:29.97,"challenge. >> NICK: Yeah, baby!"
14,00:00:33.60,00:00:33.60,">> JEFF: In a departure from previous tribal councils, Ogakor"
15,00:00:36.53,00:00:36.53,"voted against one of their own. >> COLBY: Jerri, Jerri, Jerri,"
16,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,that knock you keep hearing on your door-- it's checkout time.
17,00:00:42.50,00:00:42.50,>> JEFF: And Jerri was booted from the tribe.
18,00:00:44.73,00:00:44.73,"Jerri, the tribe has spoken. Seven people left."
19,00:00:48.97,00:00:48.97,"Who will be voted out tonight? >> AMBER: Last night, at tribal"
20,00:02:19.30,00:02:19.30,"council, Jerri got voted off. And I think that the group"
21,00:02:22.43,00:02:22.43,definitely isolated me from their decision because they
22,00:02:25.40,00:02:25.40,thought that I was too close to Jerri.
23,00:02:26.90,00:02:26.90,"And I felt sad, not only because of Jerri leaving, but I think"
24,00:02:32.23,00:02:32.23,more so because it made me feel like my own tribe members didn't
25,00:02:36.23,00:02:36.23,even trust me enough to let me know what was going on.
26,00:02:38.57,00:02:38.57,"I felt really left out, and I hated that feeling."
27,00:02:41.37,00:02:41.37,Good morning. >> KEITH: I think Amber made a
28,00:02:46.03,00:02:46.03,tactical mistake by staying tight with Jerri.
29,00:02:49.13,00:02:49.13,"But she was visibly stunned last night that that took place, too."
30,00:02:53.63,00:02:53.63,"She didn't see it coming, so she probably felt she lost her big"
31,00:02:57.63,00:02:57.63,"sister comrade last night, and she's kind of a lone lamb out in"
32,00:03:01.83,00:03:01.83,"the midst of the rest of us now. And she's a big girl, you know?"
33,00:03:07.17,00:03:07.17,"She made that decision early on, and that's where she sits now."
34,00:03:09.97,00:03:09.97,There's nothing can be done about it.

36,00:03:15.03,00:03:15.03,( whistling the tune ) >> NICK: The mood will probably
37,00:03:20.23,00:03:20.23,be better around here. >> AMBER: This is how much rice
38,00:03:27.60,00:03:27.60,we have left to last us 14 days. This is probably enough for one
39,00:03:31.57,00:03:31.57,serving. >> NICK: This is the closest to
40,00:03:39.03,00:03:39.03,"a six-pack I've ever had. >> COLBY: You know, we're in a"
41,00:03:42.17,00:03:42.17,"spot now, but it's not the end of the world."
42,00:03:44.60,00:03:44.60,"My gosh, the human body can go days without food."
43,00:03:47.20,00:03:47.20,Where the lack of food comes in is mentally.
44,00:03:49.87,00:03:49.87,And you've got to stay tough mentally to make it through a
45,00:03:53.27,00:03:53.27,food drought like we have right now.
46,00:03:54.80,00:03:54.80,"And you can sit around and say, ""What if, you know, what if we"
47,00:03:57.27,00:03:57.27,"were to say...?"" Well, we don't have any rice."
48,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,"Woulda, coulda, shoulda. If ifs and buts were candy and"
49,00:04:02.70,00:04:02.70,"nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas."
50,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,">> TINA: And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating"
51,00:04:07.50,00:04:07.50,"any food. Here on out, it's going to have"
52,00:04:10.60,00:04:10.60,"to be everybody working together, catching crickets,"
53,00:04:14.67,00:04:14.67,"grubs, whatever we can find in order to have people fishing,"
54,00:04:18.57,00:04:18.57,and that's no easy task on its own.
55,00:04:21.00,00:04:21.00,">> ELISABETH: You know, we're starving."
56,00:04:22.53,00:04:22.53,"We haven't eaten in 24 hours, and we had a lot to do, and no"
57,00:04:26.50,00:04:26.50,energy-- none. Everyone here was just in slow
58,00:04:28.10,00:04:28.10,"motion. You know, I think everyone here"
59,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,would bring back Jerri if we had rice to come with her.
60,00:04:36.23,00:04:36.23,( laughing ) >> KEITH: Got him.
61,00:05:16.60,00:05:16.60,Look at that. You show me Colby doing that.
62,00:05:20.93,00:05:20.93,"A cowboy can ride bulls and horses, but he can't catch"
63,00:05:23.03,00:05:23.03,"grasshoppers. Oh, look at that-- it's coming"
64,00:05:25.53,00:05:25.53,out. >> COLBY: You know what?
65,00:05:38.63,00:05:38.63,"I had two grasshoppers this morning, and a frog."
66,00:05:40.80,00:05:40.80,"But the big ones, you can't even tire those guys out, man."
67,00:05:44.20,00:05:44.20,"They fly forever and are very scarce, so you can't sneak up on"
68,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,those. The ones everybody's been
69,00:05:49.70,00:05:49.70,"fishing with is the little bitty ones, which are pretty easy to"
70,00:05:51.40,00:05:51.40,catch. I haven't seen any lately.
71,00:05:58.53,00:05:58.53,">> KEITH: Yeah, I mean, you expend a lot of energy catching"
72,00:06:00.40,00:06:00.40,"grasshoppers. You chase them down, I mean,"
73,00:06:03.60,00:06:03.60,you'll run sometimes for 100 yards... not 100 yards.
74,00:06:06.33,00:06:06.33,You'll run sometimes for several yards chasing a grasshopper
75,00:06:09.87,00:06:09.87,"down, but that grasshopper could mean a, you know, a 15-inch"
76,00:06:15.30,00:06:15.30,"black bream, so it's very important."
77,00:06:19.20,00:06:19.20,There he goes. >> COLBY: Keith probably has the
78,00:06:22.90,00:06:22.90,upper hand on the whole grasshopper wrangling.
79,00:06:25.40,00:06:25.40,A little more experience under his belt.
80,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,"You know, he's been at it a while, and he kind of has a"
81,00:06:31.10,00:06:31.10,handle on it. >> KEITH: Just kind of stun them
82,00:06:34.43,00:06:34.43,a little bit. >> COLBY: I've yet to figure out
83,00:06:38.50,00:06:38.50,"his method, but I may have to go to the master so he can teach"
84,00:06:42.93,00:06:42.93,young grasshopper how to wrangle grasshoppers.
85,00:06:45.07,00:06:45.07,>> KEITH: Excuse me. I just caught a grasshopper.
86,00:06:48.33,00:06:48.33,"Kind of important. Oh, no."
87,00:06:57.83,00:06:57.83,It's like the 747 of grasshoppers.
88,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,There you go. I took a wing and a leg off.
89,00:07:03.87,00:07:03.87,I was hungry. >> ELISABETH: Thanks.
90,00:07:06.40,00:07:06.40,I'm close to that. Oh...!
91,00:07:21.57,00:07:21.57,A turtle. I hate those turtles.
92,00:07:25.77,00:07:25.77,I'm going to try and keep calm. I don't know whether to break
93,00:07:31.57,00:07:31.57,this rod or try and eat it. E-mail.
94,00:07:44.80,00:07:44.80,"""Elisabeth."" What is in here?"
95,00:07:47.50,00:07:47.50,"There's, like,... >> AMBER: Money in there."
96,00:07:49.80,00:07:49.80,">> ELISABETH: What is this? >> AMBER: Wait, hold on, let me"
97,00:07:52.10,00:07:52.10,"read the card. ""For this next challenge, you'll"
98,00:07:55.13,00:07:55.13,"have to be shrewd, It's time to find out the real"
99,00:07:58.07,00:07:58.07,"value of food."" >> ELISABETH: Priceless."
100,00:08:01.67,00:08:01.67,"""If you don't believe a snack is worth more than gold,"
101,00:08:04.50,00:08:04.50,"Watch it going once, going twice, and then it will be"
102,00:08:05.93,00:08:05.93,"sold."" It's going to be an auction."
103,00:08:09.03,00:08:09.03,>> AMBER: We all have a certain amount of money to auction on
104,00:08:10.37,00:08:10.37,food. >> ELISABETH: Check it out--
105,00:08:11.63,00:08:11.63,money. >> RODGER: Wow!
106,00:08:13.83,00:08:13.83,">> AMBER: Yes, it's real money. >> ELISABETH: Colby, they could"
107,00:08:16.53,00:08:16.53,get us some peanut butter. >> AMBER: But I think we'll all
108,00:08:19.03,00:08:19.03,"be getting something. >> TINA: Wow, I'm excited."
109,00:08:21.37,00:08:21.37,">> ELISABETH: You guys, we'll get something."
110,00:08:24.53,00:08:24.53,"( thunder rumbling ) >> JEFF: Okay, guys, welcome to"

299,00:19:20.37,00:19:20.37,but I'm really disappointed in Nick right now.
300,00:19:23.87,00:19:23.87,"I really am. You know, maybe we're the dumb"

307,00:19:45.03,00:19:45.03,Rodger or myself. And that's scary.
308,00:19:47.17,00:19:47.17,That makes me mad. >> NICK: I feel vulnerable
309,00:19:49.80,00:19:49.80,because I still remain a physical threat to win
310,00:19:53.20,00:19:53.20,challenges. I won the last immunity

312,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,to feed. So I'm feeling vulnerable.

322,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"On the other end, a water bucket."
323,00:20:53.97,00:20:53.97,Your goal: create fire in that fire bucket and then by putting

367,00:27:27.27,00:27:27.27,"I mean, but I'm just, like, shaking and weak, and I'm just"
368,00:27:35.13,00:27:35.13,frustrated with how I feel. I couldn't even walk up the hill
369,00:27:38.77,00:27:38.77,"to fish. I mean, I hate not being able to"
370,00:27:41.57,00:27:41.57,help out and get some food. We need to get rice today.
371,00:27:55.20,00:27:55.20,"I just want my strength back. I'm just nauseous and, like,..."
372,00:28:00.33,00:28:00.33,"oh, man. >> NICK: It's hard to get"
373,00:28:03.00,00:28:03.00,started in the morning. >> ELISABETH: Yeah.
374,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,We have nothing to sustain us through the morning today.
375,00:28:12.07,00:28:12.07,We're praying for fish. We have only two hooks right
376,00:28:13.53,00:28:13.53,now. >> TINA: No luck.
377,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,Not even any bites. Rodger got a turtle.
378,00:28:18.83,00:28:18.83,">> RODGER: He pulled the hook off, so there goes another hook."
379,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,>> ELISABETH: I'm sorry I couldn't make it out here
380,00:28:24.37,00:28:24.37,sooner. I just had a rough morning.
381,00:28:27.47,00:28:27.47,">> RODGER: Why don't you come back and rest, and then we're"
382,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,going to go back out in a couple of hours.
383,00:28:31.33,00:28:31.33,>> ELISABETH: Okay. >> RODGER: Only bite I had was
384,00:28:33.03,00:28:33.03,that stupid turtle. >> ELISABETH: I'm just real low.
385,00:28:51.93,00:28:51.93,">> RODGER: Yeah, Jeff's here. He's got a big thing of rice."
386,00:28:57.73,00:28:57.73,>> TINA: He has a bad look on his face.
387,00:29:00.30,00:29:00.30,">> JEFF: What's up, guys? >> RODGER: Is that ours?"
388,00:29:07.90,00:29:07.90,">> JEFF: I come today because I'm concerned, because yesterday"
389,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,"at the immunity challenge, I saw something that I haven't seen"
390,00:29:15.47,00:29:15.47,"before-- true lethargy, a real lack of energy, especially with"
391,00:29:19.40,00:29:19.40,Elisabeth and Nick. You've got 13 days left.
392,00:29:24.40,00:29:24.40,And I don't think you're going to make it.
393,00:29:26.80,00:29:26.80,"So it puts me in an awkward situation, because you had"
394,00:29:29.70,00:29:29.70,"plenty of stuff. If rationed properly, you had"
395,00:29:32.67,00:29:32.67,enough rice and you had 25 hooks.
396,00:29:34.83,00:29:34.83,You had a tackle box you couldn't improve on.
397,00:29:37.93,00:29:37.93,So what happened with the rice? I mean why are you out?
398,00:29:41.37,00:29:41.37,>> COLBY: We just weren't careful with our rations.
399,00:29:44.60,00:29:44.60,There's not any one person to blame.
400,00:29:45.80,00:29:45.80,"We're all guilty. >> TINA: We did each lose a bag,"
401,00:29:48.30,00:29:48.30,"too, to condensation in the can. >> COLBY: But that's our own"
402,00:29:49.97,00:29:49.97,fault. >> TINA: I'm not saying it's not
403,00:29:52.63,00:29:52.63,our fault. But you just asked what
404,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,"happened, and that's part of what happened."
405,00:29:57.33,00:29:57.33,>> JEFF: Here's where we're at. My role is a giver and a taker.
406,00:30:01.27,00:30:01.27,Nothing comes cheap. I have enough rice to last you
407,00:30:06.97,00:30:06.97,your last two weeks here. >> AMBER: There's so much rice
408,00:30:09.87,00:30:09.87,there. >> JEFF: But it's not coming
409,00:30:12.60,00:30:12.60,"without a price, so I need something back."
410,00:30:15.53,00:30:15.53,"And I need something of value, substantial value to get this"
411,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,rice. >> RODGER: Blankets.
412,00:30:21.50,00:30:21.50,I think blankets would be a good tradeoff.
413,00:30:22.97,00:30:22.97,">> JEFF: Rodger, I'm talking serious value."
414,00:30:24.83,00:30:24.83,You guys are playing for... >> RODGER: You're laying there
415,00:30:27.23,00:30:27.23,"shivering some night, those blankets are of serious value."
416,00:30:29.67,00:30:29.67,>> JEFF: We're playing for $1 million.
417,00:30:31.90,00:30:31.90,">> TINA: Of what we have, what do you want?"
418,00:30:33.50,00:30:33.50,>> JEFF: I'm talking camp. >> TINA: Camp? Our tent?
419,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,">> JEFF: Shelter versus food, it's one or the other."
420,00:30:43.07,00:30:43.07,Your tarps and that Texas flag. That's what I want.
421,00:30:48.00,00:30:48.00,>> AMBER: You want all the tarps and the flag?
422,00:30:49.37,00:30:49.37,>> ELISABETH: All the tarps? >> RODGER: How are we going to
423,00:30:51.53,00:30:51.53,keep dry when it rains? It rains every day.
424,00:30:53.30,00:30:53.30,">> TINA: We could use rain jackets, the top and the sleeve."
425,00:30:55.90,00:30:55.90,">> COLBY: I mean, shelter, though."
426,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,That's a no-brainer. I'm talking about my personal
427,00:30:59.47,00:30:59.47,item here. I have no problem giving it up.
428,00:31:02.47,00:31:02.47,>> JEFF: Let me entice you a little more:
429,00:31:04.40,00:31:04.40,"25 more hooks. >> TINA: Oh, absolutely."
430,00:31:07.80,00:31:07.80,"You can have the shelter, as far as... my vote is take the"
431,00:31:09.77,00:31:09.77,shelter. >> ELISABETH: And if we have
432,00:31:11.73,00:31:11.73,"energy, we can build something. >> JEFF: Let's do it."
433,00:31:15.87,00:31:15.87,">> TINA: Thank you, Jeff. >> AMBER: Oh, my God."
434,00:31:17.77,00:31:17.77,>> JEFF: Who's got the strength to tear it down?
435,00:31:24.60,00:31:24.60,"I hate to have you disrupt everything, but..."
436,00:31:27.27,00:31:27.27,">> AMBER: We need our food, and we need to your strength."
437,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,>> JEFF: Got to have a value. Your tarps and that big old
438,00:31:32.03,00:31:32.03,"Texas flag, engineered to be a tarp."
439,00:31:47.47,00:31:47.47,">> COLBY: Take care of that, please."
440,00:31:48.23,00:31:48.23,">> JEFF: I will. Good negotiation, guys."
441,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,>> COLBY: Thank you very much. >> JEFF: I hope the food gives
442,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,you the strength to rebuild... >> ELISABETH: It will.
443,00:31:54.43,00:31:54.43,>> JEFF: ...to get through the last two weeks.
444,00:31:55.80,00:31:55.80,">> AMBER: Thank you. >> JEFF: Thanks, Rodger."
445,00:31:58.33,00:31:58.33,"All right, I'll see you guys tonight..."
446,00:31:59.80,00:31:59.80,">> KEITH: All right, Jeff. >> JEFF: ...when we have the"
447,00:32:02.13,00:32:02.13,unfortunate business of dealing with the tribal council.
448,00:32:04.23,00:32:04.23,"So, eat up today. Bye, guys."
449,00:32:15.63,00:32:15.63,">> COLBY: Once we realized that, oh, my God, our shelter's gone,"
450,00:32:17.97,00:32:17.97,the first thing we seemed to have to do was get a roof over
451,00:32:20.10,00:32:20.10,our head 'cause it really seemed like it was going to rain pretty
452,00:32:23.10,00:32:23.10,hard today. >> RODGER: It's going to be
453,00:32:25.07,00:32:25.07,pouring down rain here tonight. >> TINA: We need to start
454,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,"looking for a tree cover. >> COLBY: Actually, up in this"
455,00:32:29.80,00:32:29.80,thing would probably be the best just because there are so many
456,00:32:33.00,00:32:33.00,places to lay branches in here. >> TINA: The only downside is if
457,00:32:35.83,00:32:35.83,the river comes up again. I don't think we need to bring
458,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,the woods to us; I think we need to go to the woods.
459,00:32:39.70,00:32:39.70,>> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm. >> KEITH: So then it was trying
460,00:32:43.07,00:32:43.07,to decide where the shelter was going to be.
461,00:32:44.70,00:32:44.70,And we had a little food this morning but not enough to climb
462,00:32:47.40,00:32:47.40,"with a hill and build a shelter up in the hills, that's for"
463,00:32:49.10,00:32:49.10,sure. >> RODGER: We want to come in
464,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,here with some limbs and angle them down so it will run as much
465,00:33:03.33,00:33:03.33,water off as we can. >> TINA: I think it was a fair
466,00:33:06.83,00:33:06.83,"trade. If we can keep the rains away,"
467,00:33:11.33,00:33:11.33,as long as it's not a torrential downpour.
468,00:33:13.63,00:33:13.63,We may get wet. But there's worse things in life
469,00:33:18.60,00:33:18.60,"than being wet, such as starving to death."
470,00:33:22.90,00:33:22.90,">> COLBY: Hey, Nick, can you bring some of that brush down?"
471,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,>> TINA: Think chopping up this chest is good?
472,00:33:32.73,00:33:32.73,We're using everything that we possibly can at this point.
473,00:33:37.03,00:33:37.03,Every little bit helps. >> RODGER: I got some more.
474,00:33:46.00,00:33:46.00,>> NICK: All right. >> TINA: What do you need most
475,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,of right now? We got grass.
476,00:33:50.70,00:33:50.70,">> COLBY: I need grass and pine, that's it."
477,00:33:58.57,00:33:58.57,It's looking solid already. >> TINA: Maybe it won't even
478,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,rain tonight. >> COLBY: Maybe not.
479,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27,( thunder rumbling ) >> TINA: Maybe so.
480,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,>> NICK: Maybe so. >> AMBER: I feel a couple of
481,00:34:10.00,00:34:10.00,raindrops. >> TINA: Might as well get used
482,00:34:15.13,00:34:15.13,to it. >> NICK: These branches are not
483,00:34:19.80,00:34:19.80,going to keep us totally dry. It's going to be more water-
484,00:34:23.10,00:34:23.10,"resistant than waterproof. >> RODGER: At least we got food,"
485,00:34:26.27,00:34:26.27,brother. >> COLBY: Amber's a little bit
486,00:34:42.63,00:34:42.63,nervous about the fact that we voted Jerri off.
487,00:34:45.40,00:34:45.40,She felt like she might be the next one that we go after.
488,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,That way Amber won't know anything.
489,00:34:51.63,00:34:51.63,>> KEITH: A smart move. >> COLBY: It could be
490,00:34:54.43,00:34:54.43,potentially deadly for all three of us.
491,00:34:57.13,00:34:57.13,>> AMBER: Can you help me carry this?
492,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,>> COLBY: She and Elisabeth have been bonding quite well.
493,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,"She could very easily go over to the guys from Kucha and say,"
494,00:35:06.57,00:35:06.57,"""Hey, look, I know they're going after me next."
495,00:35:08.90,00:35:08.90,"I want to jump on with you guys."""
496,00:35:11.53,00:35:11.53,">> ELISABETH: If I were Amber, I'd feel threatened."
497,00:35:13.43,00:35:13.43,"I mean, if everyone can make Jerri go away, she can just as"
498,00:35:15.87,00:35:15.87,"easily go away. But by voting Jerri off, Ogakor"
499,00:35:25.40,00:35:25.40,diluted their power a bit. It didn't seem to be the
500,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"smartest strategic thing to do. >> AMBER: Okay, guys."
501,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40,">> ELISABETH: And, now, I think they are worried about Amber"
502,00:35:38.47,00:35:38.47,approaching us. Amber is kind of a pivot in the
503,00:35:42.57,00:35:42.57,whole Barramundi scenario. Bon app\xc3\xa9tit.
504,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77,>> TINA: That is good rice. It's so nice to have rice again.
505,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,>> AMBER: I could approach the Kucha people and go against
506,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87,"Colby, Tina and Keith. And it would be four against"
507,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40,three and we could just pick them off one by one.
508,00:36:04.13,00:36:04.13,"But how do I know that I can 100% trust the Kucha members,"
509,00:36:06.73,00:36:06.73,that they're not just playing with my mind and just pretending
510,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,to agree with me? I guess I don't know if I can
511,00:36:11.70,00:36:11.70,"trust Ogakor people, too. They could be playing with my"
512,00:36:14.23,00:36:14.23,"mind, too, but I have to play the game."
513,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,And the game's getting harder and harder as the days go on.
514,00:36:22.43,00:36:22.43,>> RODGER: We need to be heading out.
515,00:36:26.33,00:36:26.33,I guess we're ready. >> AMBER: Let's go.
516,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,">> RODGER: You're not bringing anything, Keith?"
517,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,>> JEFF: We'll now bring in our jury: Alicia and Jerri.
518,00:36:58.63,00:36:58.63,I'll remind you that the jury's not to be addressed.
519,00:37:00.97,00:37:00.97,They won't address you. They're merely here to gather
520,00:37:03.00,00:37:03.00,information to help them determine who's going to get the
521,00:37:06.43,00:37:06.43,$1 million and the title of Survivor.
522,00:37:11.90,00:37:11.90,"Okay, first things first. What was the reaction after I"
523,00:37:16.10,00:37:16.10,"left, with all your tarps and your Texas flag that you guys"
524,00:37:19.83,00:37:19.83,"have food? Tina, did you feel the"
525,00:37:22.23,00:37:22.23,negotiation was fair? >> TINA: I definitely feel like
526,00:37:24.73,00:37:24.73,it was fair. That was something that we could
527,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,rebuild. And even though you took it away
528,00:37:30.10,00:37:30.10,"from us, it's not like it couldn't be replaced."
529,00:37:33.87,00:37:33.87,"And so, to be quite honest, I was grateful that that's what"
530,00:37:36.60,00:37:36.60,"you chose. >> JEFF: Nick, obviously, you"
531,00:37:39.40,00:37:39.40,came into this a very fit guy. Are you surprised at the toll
532,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,it's taken on your body? >> NICK: I'm definitely
533,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,"surprised. I mean, I stood up today and I"
534,00:37:48.20,00:37:48.20,felt like I was really going to pass out.
535,00:37:50.27,00:37:50.27,I was waving back and forth and felt bad.
536,00:37:52.93,00:37:52.93,And the last three days have been so incredibly tough.
537,00:37:56.50,00:37:56.50,">> JEFF: Direct question: Colby, anybody here not pulling their"
538,00:37:58.50,00:37:58.50,weight? >> COLBY: No.
539,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,I don't think so. >> JEFF: Rodger?
540,00:38:05.37,00:38:05.37,">> RODGER: Overall, I think it's... everybody's been pulling"
541,00:38:07.00,00:38:07.00,"their weight. >> JEFF: Amber, how have you"
542,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"grown as a person, being out here 28 days now?"
543,00:38:14.23,00:38:14.23,">> AMBER: I am a lot more open than I ever thought I would be,"
544,00:38:17.63,00:38:17.63,and I'm willing to try new things and do new things.
545,00:38:20.33,00:38:20.33,And I'm a much riskier person now.
546,00:38:22.63,00:38:22.63,It might have taken a really hard experience to learn that
547,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,"about myself, but I think it's definitely worth it."
548,00:38:28.47,00:38:28.47,>> JEFF: I want you guys to just take a second and look at Alicia
549,00:38:31.77,00:38:31.77,and Jerri. Slowly the power base shifts
550,00:38:35.23,00:38:35.23,"from this side to that side. In the end, it comes down to"
551,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,politics. How can you possibly vote
552,00:38:41.27,00:38:41.27,somebody out and get their vote at the end?

557,00:39:26.20,00:39:26.20,arrogance. >> TINA: You seem like a really

559,00:40:09.00,00:40:09.00,that you weren't having fun anymore.
560,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,"So, here's your ticket, buddy. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the"
561,00:40:19.67,00:40:19.67,votes. I'll read the votes.

570,00:41:33.73,00:41:33.73,>> RODGER: Hang in there. Hang in there.

579,00:42:40.87,00:42:40.87,drastically primal. >> JEFF: Has Barramundi been
580,00:42:44.00,00:42:44.00,"pushed to the brink, or is their greatest challenge yet to come?"
581,00:42:48.50,00:42:48.50,">> ELISABETH: Oh, my God. >> RODGER: Our camp is a dry"
582,00:42:50.83,00:42:50.83,creek bed. I doubt if it's dry right now.

584,00:43:03.30,00:43:03.30,"times, and some big blows. The last few days have"
