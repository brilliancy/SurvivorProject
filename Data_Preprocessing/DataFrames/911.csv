565,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,run and he wins immunity thenext couple of times.
566,00:32:44.67,00:32:44.67,"That would be really bad.>> So, I mean, it's 100%"
567,00:33:00.08,00:33:00.08,"but if it does change,I'll tell you, but I don't"
568,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,"think, I swear...>> How, how, how is that"
569,00:33:06.12,00:33:06.12,"going to swing, me not goinghome?"
570,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,">> Because, I mean,everyone just thinks you deserve"
571,00:33:10.25,00:33:10.25,it more.Are you surprised?
572,00:33:13.88,00:33:13.88,">> I'm happy.I mean, I'm pumped."
573,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,It's like being in a tornado.It is crazy.
574,00:33:20.04,00:33:20.04,I don't even have to dosomething to change the tide of
575,00:33:23.12,00:33:23.12,the game.There's six women living with
576,00:33:24.92,00:33:24.92,me-- they'll change itthemselves.
577,00:33:27.92,00:33:27.92,"It can be set in stone who'sgoing home, and five minutes"
578,00:33:31.92,00:33:31.92,"later, I'm not going home and Iain't done a damn thing to"
579,00:33:35.08,00:33:35.08,change it.I'm just sitting there by the
580,00:33:37.08,00:33:37.08,fire.So I make my way out to get some
581,00:33:39.54,00:33:39.54,"wood and Twila says to mewhile we're filling this crate,"
582,00:33:42.08,00:33:42.08,"""You know, you can change thisgame completely."""
583,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,"So I'm thinking, ""I'm all ears,Twila."""
584,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,>> Think about it.>> Think about it.
585,00:34:05.21,00:34:05.21,>> You are so right.>> If you would just get
586,00:34:12.25,00:34:12.25,"Eliza, say, ""If you want tochange this whole outlook, vote"
587,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,"this way, you've got three otherpeople backing you up."""
588,00:34:18.12,00:34:18.12,>> Guaranteed?Scout's a guarantee?
589,00:34:20.04,00:34:20.04,>> Guaranteed.I swore on my son's name.
590,00:34:23.25,00:34:23.25,"May God forgive me for sayingthat, because it's not the right"
591,00:34:25.46,00:34:25.46,"thing to do, but it's time forsomething to change."
592,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,Ami and Leann just act likethey're so much better than
593,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,everybody else and they've gotthis all wrapped up in their
594,00:34:34.04,00:34:34.04,"back pocket, and, and it justfreaking pisses me off."
595,00:34:41.83,00:34:41.83,">> 'Cause right now, I'mstill in..."
596,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,>> I'm not going to.You have my word.
597,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"I'm not going to, Twila.>> I'll get this."
598,00:34:50.79,00:34:50.79,Am I willing to do it?Damn right I'm willing to do it.
599,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,"I'll turn the tide, I'll takethe risk right now."
600,00:34:55.62,00:34:55.62,So I talked to Eliza.Here's the bottom line:
601,00:34:58.83,00:34:58.83,"Julie told me, ""You're staying,you're not going home tonight."
602,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,"We're voting for Eliza.""That's the exact words I was"
603,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"told, okay?Listen, Eliza."
604,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,You don't have to go hometonight.
605,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,All's you got to do is onething.
606,00:35:10.88,00:35:10.88,">> Okay, what do I haveto do?"
607,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,>> This is how you can stay.>> Chris pulls me aside
608,00:35:15.38,00:35:15.38,"and says, ""Twila and Scoutdiscussed with him the"
609,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,"possibility of changing thisgame around, and the only way"
610,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,"to do it would be with my vote.>> You have my word,"
611,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,I swear to you.>> But I don't trust
612,00:35:24.04,00:35:24.04,"Scout and Twila, that's whatscares me."
613,00:35:25.54,00:35:25.54,>> You do not have toworry about Scout and Twila.
614,00:35:27.38,00:35:27.38,"I swear, I have talked...>> I think this is a big"
615,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,plot and I'm gonna go home.>> I don't know how to
616,00:35:32.62,00:35:32.62,reassure you.I am just telling you the truth.
617,00:35:34.83,00:35:34.83,I've never lied to you.I'm not using you.
618,00:35:36.58,00:35:36.58,>> But the thing thatworries me is that Scout and
619,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,Twila are lying to both of us.>> Just please take this risk.
620,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,>> PROBST: Now bring in thejury.
621,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"Sarge and Chad, voted out atthe last Tribal Council."
622,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,Okay.The last three days have had a
623,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,"lot of emotion.Eliza, did having your mom here"
624,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,wake you up to how close youare to winning this thing?
625,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,">> Um, yes, having gottento the point of the family visit"
626,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"in this game made me realizehow far along we really are,"
627,00:36:28.54,00:36:28.54,"because we have talked aboutthis on day seven maybe, and it"
628,00:36:31.21,00:36:31.21,"was, it was a long-term goal forall of us."
629,00:36:34.46,00:36:34.46,">> PROBST: Chris, what was itlike to be in an immunity"
630,00:36:36.71,00:36:36.71,"challenge where, clearly, you,of all people, have definitely"
631,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,"felt on your heels for a while.Now you have your fiancée, who"
632,00:36:43.42,00:36:43.42,"can help you or hurt you inthis game, depending on how well"
633,00:36:45.83,00:36:45.83,"you do?>> I knew that, uh, she"
634,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,was wanting to give it 110%.It meant a lot to her to come
635,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"through and, you know, get meimmunity."
636,00:36:55.79,00:36:55.79,"Um, we worked hard together andshe gave it 110%."
637,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,I love her to death.She did a great job today.
638,00:37:01.58,00:37:01.58,">> PROBST: Now, at the other endof the spectrum, Leann, you"
639,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,seemed just so happy to haveTeri there that you were taking
640,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,"more of the moment of afriendship thing, ""Look what"
641,00:37:10.58,00:37:10.58,"we're doing together, and if Idon't win immunity, I don't win"
642,00:37:12.83,00:37:12.83,"immunity."">> Well, I really wanted to win."
643,00:37:15.83,00:37:15.83,"I mean, I set out to win, but,you know, you get halfway"
644,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,through and you realize there'snot a chance in hell you're
645,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,going to win it.Then I just thought it was
646,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,funny.Why not laugh with it?
647,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,I'm not going to have her feelbad about it.
648,00:37:28.46,00:37:28.46,"That would be horrible.>> PROBST: Well, it seems to me"
649,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,"that Chris, out of everybodyhere, was connecting with Laurie"
650,00:37:33.58,00:37:33.58,"in a way like nobody else was,which is regardless of what's"
651,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"happening, I got to win thisthing."
652,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,>> I didn't tell her itwas life or death for me.
653,00:37:41.71,00:37:41.71,"I didn't feel like it was.>> PROBST: Eliza, once again,"
654,00:37:44.83,00:37:44.83,you brought your bag.>> Jeff...
655,00:37:47.21,00:37:47.21,>> PROBST: You're becoming thegirl who cried wolf.
656,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,">> But you know what?It's, like, ""Oh, Eliza was"
657,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,"just being paranoid, Eliza'sjust being paranoid."""
658,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,"And then every time I get backto camp and I find out, ""Oh, my"
659,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"God, I was this close to beingvoted off."""
660,00:37:58.42,00:37:58.42,It is not paranoia.It is valid 100%.
661,00:38:01.92,00:38:01.92,And I very well might be goinghome tonight.
662,00:38:04.54,00:38:04.54,No joke.>> PROBST: I don't think it is a

669,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,">> Um, it's me and sixwomen-- six women."
670,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,There's tension between sixwomen.
671,00:38:29.71,00:38:29.71,"I don't care what anybody says.I can see and feel the tension,"
672,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,and whether it be them playingthe game and strategizing or
673,00:38:37.08,00:38:37.08,"figuring out, you know, whothey want to go home next,"
674,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,"there's always that feelingthat, you know, something's"
