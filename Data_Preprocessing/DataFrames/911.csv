12,00:00:33.42,00:00:33.42,I've never been in a worse situation than this.

14,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00,oust Eliza and then Ami. When the others returned from

23,00:01:10.67,00:01:10.67,>> They're not going to vote for Eliza.

25,00:01:14.88,00:01:14.88,>> I'm not going to do nothing yet.
26,00:01:16.17,00:01:16.17,I'm still thinking. I'm aggravated.
27,00:01:19.08,00:01:19.08,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Scout admitted to scheming with"
28,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,the guys. >> We have talked quite a
29,00:01:23.96,00:01:23.96,bit about different strategies to get to the end of the game.
30,00:01:26.96,00:01:26.96,>> It makes me nervous that two women might be voting
31,00:01:29.42,00:01:29.42,with the two men. >> PROBST: Although Eliza
32,00:01:31.83,00:01:31.83,"received two votes, the women's alliance held strong, and Chad"
33,00:01:35.83,00:01:35.83,"was voted out of the tribe... Chad, the tribe has spoken."
34,00:01:39.12,00:01:39.12,...leaving Chris as the last man standing.
35,00:01:42.67,00:01:42.67,Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

38,00:03:20.04,00:03:20.04,"going home, though. Tribal Council sucks."
39,00:03:22.38,00:03:22.38,I hate it. I always think I'm going home.
40,00:03:25.04,00:03:25.04,"It's kind of funny, but everyone who conspires against me ends up"
41,00:03:27.33,00:03:27.33,off and I'm still here. >> Yeah.
42,00:03:36.79,00:03:36.79,Scout and Twila come to me and Chad wanting to form an alliance
43,00:03:41.71,00:03:41.71,with us. And Scout thought she could get
44,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,"you and Leann to vote for Eliza. And when Eliza was gone, then"
45,00:03:50.42,00:03:50.42,"Scout, Twila, me and Chad would have the numbers on you, Ami and"
46,00:03:54.67,00:03:54.67,"Leann, and we'd get rid of Ami first."
47,00:03:58.54,00:03:58.54,Swear to God on my family's lives.
48,00:04:02.79,00:04:02.79,"As soon as I got back to camp, I narc'd out Scout and Twila, and"
49,00:04:06.08,00:04:06.08,I let them know that they had conspired with me and Chad for
50,00:04:08.50,00:04:08.50,"an alliance. I just, you know, I just mixed"
51,00:04:11.83,00:04:11.83,things up as soon as we got back.
52,00:04:13.79,00:04:13.79,"It's going to be a mess. >> Oh, boy."
53,00:04:17.21,00:04:17.21,This kind of changes everything in my head for the moment.
54,00:04:19.96,00:04:19.96,>> Mm-hmm. It's hard to choose what to
55,00:04:21.92,00:04:21.92,believe because it would do Chris a lot of good to get us
56,00:04:25.79,00:04:25.79,mad at Twila and Scout. It would make him last longer in
57,00:04:29.21,00:04:29.21,the game. >> I'm actually very surprised
58,00:04:46.75,00:04:46.75,that things happened the way they did last night.
59,00:04:50.12,00:04:50.12,So I told Twila about it. I heard some things that I'm not
60,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,"very comfortable with, and we need to talk about it."
61,00:05:01.42,00:05:01.42,>> Paranoia sets in on a lot of us.
62,00:05:04.96,00:05:04.96,"And I think it needs to quit. >> I have to tell you,"
63,00:05:07.08,00:05:07.08,"Twila, you're striking me as a panic player right now."
64,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,>> Why? >> It makes me feel like
65,00:05:10.08,00:05:10.08,you're going to jump ship. >> She just completely
66,00:05:17.42,00:05:17.42,"confirmed the story, but she told me it was all Scout's idea."
67,00:05:21.25,00:05:21.25,"Man, I just didn't think it would happen this soon."
68,00:05:23.46,00:05:23.46,I thought we'd at least wait until the guys were gone before
69,00:05:25.79,00:05:25.79,the girls started going crazy on each other.
70,00:05:28.25,00:05:28.25,"But, oh, it's happening. If they were going to go with"
71,00:05:30.92,00:05:30.92,"that plan, they should have stuck with it, 'cause now,"
72,00:05:32.33,00:05:32.33,they're screwed. >> PROBST: And then there were
73,00:05:52.67,00:05:52.67,seven. All right.
74,00:05:55.17,00:05:55.17,"For today's challenge, we're going to test how much you"
75,00:05:57.92,00:05:57.92,recall from the past 28 days. I'm going to ask you five
76,00:06:01.46,00:06:01.46,questions about past challenges. Each time you get an answer
77,00:06:04.54,00:06:04.54,"right, you score a point. At the end of five questions,"
78,00:06:07.12,00:06:07.12,the person with the most points wins the reward.
79,00:06:09.46,00:06:09.46,Want to know what you're playing for?
80,00:06:10.88,00:06:10.88,>> Yes. >> Sure do.
81,00:06:12.71,00:06:12.71,">> PROBST: It's no big secret, after 28 days, the one thing you"

84,00:06:19.42,00:06:19.42,">> Oh, no. >> PROBST: So here's what we've"
85,00:06:21.21,00:06:21.21,set up. We brought in a satellite.
86,00:06:24.00,00:06:24.00,We have a computer hooked up to the Internet.
87,00:06:26.38,00:06:26.38,The winner's going to get a one-hour real-time e-mail
88,00:06:30.04,00:06:30.04,"back-and-forth chat. You can type something, they can"
89,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,type back to you. So this is a chance to get
90,00:06:35.75,00:06:35.75,"caught up with what's going on back home, give a little love"
91,00:06:38.92,00:06:38.92,and certainly get a whole lot of love that you need to make it
92,00:06:42.00,00:06:42.00,through the last 11 days. Worth playing for?
93,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,>> ALL: Yeah. >> PROBST: I want to whet your
94,00:06:46.79,00:06:46.79,appetite and give everybody a one-minute e-mail hello.

102,00:07:07.42,00:07:07.42,I don't know how to type. >> PROBST: You don't?
103,00:07:08.83,00:07:08.83,>> No. >> PROBST: So you don't use

208,00:12:26.54,00:12:26.54,four different symbols used on the colored tiles.

210,00:12:39.04,00:12:39.04,Everybody reveal. The four symbols were the

212,00:12:45.79,00:12:45.79,"and a skull. Chris, pig head is right."

214,00:12:51.46,00:12:51.46,"tree is right, pig is right. Leann has volcano, pig and palm"
215,00:12:54.83,00:12:54.83,tree. All three are correct.
216,00:12:57.42,00:12:57.42,"Ami has volcano, skull, and palm tree."
217,00:13:00.42,00:13:00.42,"Julie: pig, volcano and skull. You score three."

221,00:13:12.12,00:13:12.12,I'll give you one for the pig. >> Thank you.

223,00:13:19.08,00:13:19.08,Everybody else tied at six. Final question: In the first
224,00:13:23.12,00:13:23.12,"reward challenge, which survivor fell into the water the most?"
225,00:13:34.12,00:13:34.12,Everybody reveal. The correct answer was John K.

227,00:13:40.62,00:13:40.62,Eliza got it right and Twila got it right.
228,00:13:43.25,00:13:43.25,Julie and Eliza tied at seven will now go into a tie-breaker
229,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,"for just those two. Julie and Ami, switch seats."
230,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,"At stake, a visit with your loved one."

234,00:14:07.04,00:14:07.04,These are the items you guys gathered in the memory game.
235,00:14:11.67,00:14:11.67,Julie has an absolutely blank look on her face.
236,00:14:17.12,00:14:17.12,"Eliza writing like crazy. Four, three, two, one."
237,00:14:26.62,00:14:26.62,Reveal. Julie has absolutely nothing
238,00:14:30.04,00:14:30.04,written down. Which means if Eliza has even
239,00:14:32.25,00:14:32.25,"just one right, she wins. First answer is grapefruit."
240,00:14:36.21,00:14:36.21,"""Grapefruit"" is right. You win reward."
241,00:14:38.58,00:14:38.58,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Nice job.
242,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Eliza, ready to go"
243,00:14:42.08,00:14:42.08,have a little chat with your mom?
244,00:14:43.83,00:14:43.83,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Or would you rather
245,00:14:45.42,00:14:45.42,your mom came out here and chatted with you?
246,00:14:47.04,00:14:47.04,">> No! Are you kidding! >> PROBST: Come on out, Susan."
247,00:14:49.04,00:14:49.04,"(both shrieking) >> Oh, my God!"

249,00:15:00.08,00:15:00.08,I can't believe you're here! I can't believe this!
250,00:15:02.17,00:15:02.17,">> You look so beautiful. >> Oh, my God!"
251,00:15:05.67,00:15:05.67,">> You did it! >> PROBST: Okay, Susan, here's"
252,00:15:08.75,00:15:08.75,the twist. It's not a one-hour chat.
253,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,It's an overnight chat. Go over and have a seat with
254,00:15:17.96,00:15:17.96,Eliza and get to know everybody. So you probably figured out
255,00:15:22.29,00:15:22.29,everybody has been here. We've created a little studio so
256,00:15:25.88,00:15:25.88,you could talk to them. There's a winner and a bunch of
257,00:15:28.96,00:15:28.96,"losers, but because I saw how much it meant to you guys in"
258,00:15:32.29,00:15:32.29,"there, you get one little good-bye."
259,00:15:35.62,00:15:35.62,"So Twila, here's your son James. >> Oh, my God."
260,00:15:40.83,00:15:40.83,My fella! >> Mom!
261,00:15:47.46,00:15:47.46,">> I miss you so much, so much, so much, so much."
262,00:15:50.17,00:15:50.17,">> PROBST: Twila, get a good last hug in."

266,00:15:58.79,00:15:58.79,"spot right here. All right, Leann, get over here."
267,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,"Let's get Teri out here. Come on, Teri."
268,00:16:16.12,00:16:16.12,">> A couple weeks, okay? I love you."
269,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,">> You look awesome. I love you, too."
270,00:16:20.04,00:16:20.04,"Okay, bye. >> PROBST: Scout, come on over"
271,00:16:22.46,00:16:22.46,here. See if we can rustle up Annie.
272,00:16:25.88,00:16:25.88,"(Annie shrieking) >> Oh, my God."
273,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33,>> I missed you so much. Still do.
274,00:16:34.71,00:16:34.71,You look great. Have fun.
275,00:16:39.08,00:16:39.08,">> PROBST: Julie, let's bring out Justin."
276,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,"(Julie shrieking, laughing) >> My pants are up."
277,00:16:51.88,00:16:51.88,"Come here, buddy! I want to eat you up."
278,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,">> PROBST: All right, Ami. Come on up."
279,00:16:59.21,00:16:59.21,"See if Crissy is back there. Come on out, Crissy."
280,00:17:02.17,00:17:02.17,">> Oh, my God. >> Hi, baby."
281,00:17:10.62,00:17:10.62,It's so good to hug you again. >> How about you and I go
282,00:17:17.12,00:17:17.12,"over there? >> PROBST: Chris, come on out"
283,00:17:19.08,00:17:19.08,"here. Come on, Laurie."
284,00:17:34.17,00:17:34.17,">> Okay. Love you, too."
285,00:17:38.21,00:17:38.21,">> PROBST: All right, everybody. I hate to break this party up."
286,00:17:40.38,00:17:40.38,Your boat has arrived. You're heading back to the
287,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,States. Say good-bye.
288,00:17:45.71,00:17:45.71,">> Okay, babe. Okay. Bye."
289,00:17:49.96,00:17:49.96,">> PROBST: All right. With that, you are going to get"
290,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,to camp for the night. They'll take you back and show
291,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,you what life on Survivor is like.
292,00:17:56.71,00:17:56.71,"All right, guys, get your stuff, head back to camp."
293,00:17:58.62,00:17:58.62,Have a good night. >> I want to hear about
294,00:18:21.54,00:18:21.54,"the outside world. >> Me, too."
295,00:18:23.00,00:18:23.00,>> I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad.
296,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"Oh, I couldn't be more excited to be able to share this"
297,00:18:30.62,00:18:30.62,experience with my mom. I want to share everything with
298,00:18:32.50,00:18:32.50,my mom. My mom is my best friend in the
299,00:18:34.67,00:18:34.67,entire world and I could not be more excited that she's here
300,00:18:37.12,00:18:37.12,"with us. Oh, Mom, we have leftover trail"
301,00:18:39.21,00:18:39.21,mix. It's just fried coconuts and
302,00:18:41.17,00:18:41.17,plantains. >> Really?
303,00:18:42.21,00:18:42.21,>> If you want to try. >> Is it safe for me to get it?
304,00:18:44.50,00:18:44.50,">> Oh, yeah. >> Oh, yeah."
305,00:18:45.75,00:18:45.75,">> I don't double dip, even if I'm here."
306,00:18:47.38,00:18:47.38,">> Mom, you don't have a choice here."
307,00:18:51.21,00:18:51.21,>> Does she look different to you?
308,00:18:52.62,00:18:52.62,Does she look thinner? >> She looks thinner.
309,00:18:55.21,00:18:55.21,"I know on the, on the computer screen, her face looks, you"
310,00:18:58.33,00:18:58.33,know... bony. I-I was really worried about
311,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,Eliza just being out here. I was worried about bug bites.
312,00:19:05.67,00:19:05.67,I was worried about parasites. I was worried that she wouldn't
313,00:19:09.46,00:19:09.46,be flossing every day. I was worried about Ebola virus.
314,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,"I was worried about all these things in the sea, the-the-the"
315,00:19:17.12,00:19:17.12,coral and the things that can cut you and the fish that can
316,00:19:19.29,00:19:19.29,"bite you, and... I was worried."
317,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,I don't know how good my letter was.
318,00:19:26.25,00:19:26.25,>> Your letter was great. It was fine.
319,00:19:28.25,00:19:28.25,There's definitely a possibility that people are very resentful
320,00:19:30.67,00:19:30.67,that I won that challenge and they didn't.
321,00:19:32.50,00:19:32.50,"It could definitely work to my disadvantage, but hopefully, if"
322,00:19:35.42,00:19:35.42,"she bonds with them, that could help me."
323,00:19:37.38,00:19:37.38,It was supposed to be me or Leann gone on day six.
324,00:19:39.46,00:19:39.46,"The first time the women lost, it was either Eliza or Leann,"
325,00:19:42.00,00:19:42.00,and it was all-- You want to know why it was?
326,00:19:43.88,00:19:43.88,What their reasoning was? I talked too much.
327,00:19:46.08,00:19:46.08,>> You're too annoying. >> Answer me this.
328,00:19:53.21,00:19:53.21,"This morning I asked Twila, I said, did you, Scout, Chad and"
329,00:19:57.92,00:19:57.92,"Chris have a plan to vote off Eliza and then Ami next, and she"
330,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,"said, ""That was Scout's idea."" >> Yeah, it was Chad's."
331,00:20:02.92,00:20:02.92,>> That's what she told me. >> She said it was your plan.
332,00:20:04.88,00:20:04.88,"She said it was Scout's idea. >> And I was like, ""What?"""
333,00:20:07.75,00:20:07.75,">> When I came out here, I was determined to play the"
334,00:20:10.29,00:20:10.29,"game with integrity and honesty and truth, and if they that"
335,00:20:13.21,00:20:13.21,"didn't work, then I'd lie, cheat and steal."
336,00:20:15.12,00:20:15.12,"We've now reduced ourselves to the lie, cheat and steal part."
337,00:20:18.08,00:20:18.08,"It was Chad's idea, and that is the God's honest truth."
338,00:20:23.21,00:20:23.21,"Didn't we have an agreement when we came over here, no matter"
339,00:20:26.04,00:20:26.04,"what anybody says, we're gonna stick together."
340,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,">> I said we'd stick together when we came over, but I never"
341,00:20:31.25,00:20:31.25,"made any promises about Final Four with you, Scout."
342,00:20:34.21,00:20:34.21,">> Well, I thought you had. I thought that the three of us"
343,00:20:38.92,00:20:38.92,"plus Twila, that we would, that we would go to the..."
344,00:20:41.33,00:20:41.33,>> We didn't ever say anything about the Final Four.
345,00:20:44.46,00:20:44.46,>> So I did a little damage control there.
346,00:20:46.67,00:20:46.67,"But Leann and Ami have backed out of their alliance with me,"
347,00:20:50.38,00:20:50.38,that we would go all the way to the end of the game together.
348,00:20:53.25,00:20:53.25,"Call it Final Four, call it whatever you want to, we would"
349,00:20:55.71,00:20:55.71,go to the end of the game together and include Twila.
350,00:20:59.08,00:20:59.08,>> Have you promised Jules? >> I have since promised Jules.
351,00:21:04.50,00:21:04.50,>> Okay. So you want Jules to go to the Final Four?
352,00:21:06.38,00:21:06.38,>> I do. >> (snarling)
353,00:21:12.88,00:21:12.88,"My hackles came up, and they're still up."
354,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,"You know, whatever happens, you know, ""Vengeance is mine,"""
355,00:21:20.12,00:21:20.12,sayeth the jury. >> That's cute.
356,00:21:42.50,00:21:42.50,She'll love it. >> Eliza's mom will
357,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,"probably be leaving soon, and everybody's doing a little"
358,00:21:48.04,00:21:48.04,something that maybe she can pass on to our loved ones.
359,00:21:51.00,00:21:51.00,>> This is for Laurie. >> Something for them to
360,00:21:53.88,00:21:53.88,remember us by and let them know we're thinking about them.
361,00:21:56.12,00:21:56.12,">> This has been so great, Mom. This has just been so great."
362,00:22:00.88,00:22:00.88,>> There's the boat. >> But Mama....
363,00:22:07.67,00:22:07.67,"I love you so much. >> I love you so much, too."
364,00:22:11.46,00:22:11.46,>> Having my mom here has definitely motivated me and made
365,00:22:14.46,00:22:14.46,"me know that I can get through this and I'm almost there, and"
366,00:22:17.83,00:22:17.83,it's just so wonderful that she got to spend this time with me.
367,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,">> Take this, too. Keep warm."
368,00:22:24.17,00:22:24.17,>> Okay. >> You're a good mom.
369,00:22:25.42,00:22:25.42,>> The shirt off my back. >> She took the shirt off
370,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,her back and gave it to me because I don't have anything
371,00:22:31.50,00:22:31.50,with sleeves even. >> She came out and stripped
372,00:22:37.00,00:22:37.00,to her panties and left in only her bra.
373,00:22:40.00,00:22:40.00,She is our kind of woman. >> ALL: Bye!
374,00:22:55.96,00:22:55.96,>> There's one big one right there.
375,00:22:57.79,00:22:57.79,">> Ami, Twila and I went to get manioc."

384,00:23:21.54,00:23:21.54,Just understand how that kinda doesn't really look so good.

402,00:24:09.62,00:24:09.62,Don't feel guarded. I swore to Ami and Leann on my

432,00:25:59.62,00:25:59.62,hurt them. Here's how it's going to work:

439,00:26:18.38,00:26:18.38,puzzle wins immunity for their survivor.

441,00:26:24.00,00:26:24.00,We'll get started. This is going to be fun.

561,00:32:27.96,00:32:27.96,"next, but it's not setting really well for Leann, so if she"
562,00:32:31.21,00:32:31.21,"decides that it's not right, then I'm going to stick with"
563,00:32:33.21,00:32:33.21,"what she says. >> All right, we've made"

568,00:33:00.08,00:33:00.08,"but if it does change, I'll tell you, but I don't"
569,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,"think, I swear... >> How, how, how is that"
570,00:33:06.12,00:33:06.12,"going to swing, me not going home?"
571,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,">> Because, I mean, everyone just thinks you deserve"
572,00:33:10.25,00:33:10.25,it more. Are you surprised?
573,00:33:13.88,00:33:13.88,">> I'm happy. I mean, I'm pumped."
574,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,It's like being in a tornado. It is crazy.
575,00:33:20.04,00:33:20.04,I don't even have to do something to change the tide of
576,00:33:23.12,00:33:23.12,the game. There's six women living with
577,00:33:24.92,00:33:24.92,me-- they'll change it themselves.
578,00:33:27.92,00:33:27.92,"It can be set in stone who's going home, and five minutes"
579,00:33:31.92,00:33:31.92,"later, I'm not going home and I ain't done a damn thing to"
580,00:33:35.08,00:33:35.08,change it. I'm just sitting there by the
581,00:33:37.08,00:33:37.08,fire. So I make my way out to get some
582,00:33:39.54,00:33:39.54,"wood and Twila says to me while we're filling this crate,"
583,00:33:42.08,00:33:42.08,"""You know, you can change this game completely."""
584,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,"So I'm thinking, ""I'm all ears, Twila."""
585,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,>> Think about it. >> Think about it.
586,00:34:05.21,00:34:05.21,>> You are so right. >> If you would just get
587,00:34:12.25,00:34:12.25,"Eliza, say, ""If you want to change this whole outlook, vote"
588,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,"this way, you've got three other people backing you up."""
589,00:34:18.12,00:34:18.12,>> Guaranteed? Scout's a guarantee?
590,00:34:20.04,00:34:20.04,>> Guaranteed. I swore on my son's name.
591,00:34:23.25,00:34:23.25,"May God forgive me for saying that, because it's not the right"
592,00:34:25.46,00:34:25.46,"thing to do, but it's time for something to change."
593,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,Ami and Leann just act like they're so much better than
594,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,everybody else and they've got this all wrapped up in their
595,00:34:34.04,00:34:34.04,"back pocket, and, and it just freaking pisses me off."
596,00:34:41.83,00:34:41.83,">> 'Cause right now, I'm still in..."
597,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,>> I'm not going to. You have my word.
598,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"I'm not going to, Twila. >> I'll get this."
599,00:34:50.79,00:34:50.79,Am I willing to do it? Damn right I'm willing to do it.
600,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,"I'll turn the tide, I'll take the risk right now."
601,00:34:55.62,00:34:55.62,So I talked to Eliza. Here's the bottom line:
602,00:34:58.83,00:34:58.83,"Julie told me, ""You're staying, you're not going home tonight."
603,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,"We're voting for Eliza."" That's the exact words I was"
604,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"told, okay? Listen, Eliza."
605,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,You don't have to go home tonight.
606,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,All's you got to do is one thing.
607,00:35:10.88,00:35:10.88,">> Okay, what do I have to do?"
608,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,>> This is how you can stay. >> Chris pulls me aside
609,00:35:15.38,00:35:15.38,"and says, ""Twila and Scout discussed with him the"
610,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,"possibility of changing this game around, and the only way"
611,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,"to do it would be with my vote. >> You have my word,"
612,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,I swear to you. >> But I don't trust
613,00:35:24.04,00:35:24.04,"Scout and Twila, that's what scares me."
614,00:35:25.54,00:35:25.54,>> You do not have to worry about Scout and Twila.
615,00:35:27.38,00:35:27.38,"I swear, I have talked... >> I think this is a big"
616,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,plot and I'm gonna go home. >> I don't know how to
617,00:35:32.62,00:35:32.62,reassure you. I am just telling you the truth.
618,00:35:34.83,00:35:34.83,I've never lied to you. I'm not using you.
619,00:35:36.58,00:35:36.58,>> But the thing that worries me is that Scout and
620,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,Twila are lying to both of us. >> Just please take this risk.
621,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,>> PROBST: Now bring in the jury.
622,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"Sarge and Chad, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
623,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,Okay. The last three days have had a
624,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,"lot of emotion. Eliza, did having your mom here"
625,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,wake you up to how close you are to winning this thing?
626,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,">> Um, yes, having gotten to the point of the family visit"
627,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"in this game made me realize how far along we really are,"
628,00:36:28.54,00:36:28.54,"because we have talked about this on day seven maybe, and it"
629,00:36:31.21,00:36:31.21,"was, it was a long-term goal for all of us."
630,00:36:34.46,00:36:34.46,">> PROBST: Chris, what was it like to be in an immunity"
631,00:36:36.71,00:36:36.71,"challenge where, clearly, you, of all people, have definitely"
632,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,"felt on your heels for a while. Now you have your fianc\xc3\xa9e, who"
633,00:36:43.42,00:36:43.42,"can help you or hurt you in this game, depending on how well"
634,00:36:45.83,00:36:45.83,"you do? >> I knew that, uh, she"
635,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,was wanting to give it 110%. It meant a lot to her to come
636,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"through and, you know, get me immunity."
637,00:36:55.79,00:36:55.79,"Um, we worked hard together and she gave it 110%."
638,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,I love her to death. She did a great job today.
639,00:37:01.58,00:37:01.58,">> PROBST: Now, at the other end of the spectrum, Leann, you"
640,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,seemed just so happy to have Teri there that you were taking
641,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,"more of the moment of a friendship thing, ""Look what"
642,00:37:10.58,00:37:10.58,"we're doing together, and if I don't win immunity, I don't win"
643,00:37:12.83,00:37:12.83,"immunity."" >> Well, I really wanted to win."
644,00:37:15.83,00:37:15.83,"I mean, I set out to win, but, you know, you get halfway"
645,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,through and you realize there's not a chance in hell you're
646,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,going to win it. Then I just thought it was
647,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,funny. Why not laugh with it?
648,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,I'm not going to have her feel bad about it.
649,00:37:28.46,00:37:28.46,"That would be horrible. >> PROBST: Well, it seems to me"
650,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,"that Chris, out of everybody here, was connecting with Laurie"
651,00:37:33.58,00:37:33.58,"in a way like nobody else was, which is regardless of what's"
652,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"happening, I got to win this thing."
653,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,>> I didn't tell her it was life or death for me.
654,00:37:41.71,00:37:41.71,"I didn't feel like it was. >> PROBST: Eliza, once again,"
655,00:37:44.83,00:37:44.83,you brought your bag. >> Jeff...
656,00:37:47.21,00:37:47.21,>> PROBST: You're becoming the girl who cried wolf.
657,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,">> But you know what? It's, like, ""Oh, Eliza was"
658,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,"just being paranoid, Eliza's just being paranoid."""
659,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,"And then every time I get back to camp and I find out, ""Oh, my"
660,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"God, I was this close to being voted off."""
661,00:37:58.42,00:37:58.42,It is not paranoia. It is valid 100%.
662,00:38:01.92,00:38:01.92,And I very well might be going home tonight.
663,00:38:04.54,00:38:04.54,No joke. >> PROBST: I don't think it is a
664,00:38:06.38,00:38:06.38,joke. I just know you've said it at
665,00:38:08.75,00:38:08.75,"every single Tribal Council. >> And at every Tribal Council,"
666,00:38:10.83,00:38:10.83,I have almost been voted off. Honestly.
667,00:38:14.42,00:38:14.42,">> PROBST: Chris, as the outsider, is there any tension"
668,00:38:17.08,00:38:17.08,"with this tribe, because what you guys show me is very"
669,00:38:22.08,00:38:22.08,happy-go-lucky and everybody's having a good time.
670,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,">> Um, it's me and six women-- six women."
671,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,There's tension between six women.
672,00:38:29.71,00:38:29.71,"I don't care what anybody says. I can see and feel the tension,"
673,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,and whether it be them playing the game and strategizing or
674,00:38:37.08,00:38:37.08,"figuring out, you know, who they want to go home next,"
675,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,"there's always that feeling that, you know, something's"
676,00:38:43.46,00:38:43.46,going on that not all of them are always agreeing.
677,00:38:46.04,00:38:46.04,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
678,00:38:48.08,00:38:48.08,"Ami, you have immunity. As always, you can keep it or"
679,00:38:50.42,00:38:50.42,assign it to somebody else. >> I'm going to keep it.
680,00:38:52.92,00:38:52.92,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Ami; everybody else is fair
681,00:38:55.08,00:38:55.08,game. It is time to vote.
682,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,"Leann, you're up. >> My vote's for Eliza."
683,00:39:12.71,00:39:12.71,"Um, group consensus. Everybody agreed, but you are"
684,00:39:15.12,00:39:15.12,"like a little sister. >> Sorry, Eliza."
685,00:39:35.00,00:39:35.00,"I had to stick with the team, and I guess it's your time to"
686,00:39:38.21,00:39:38.21,go. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
687,00:39:58.08,00:39:58.08,"votes. >> PROBST: Once votes are read,"
688,00:40:16.17,00:40:16.17,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
689,00:40:18.75,00:40:18.75,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
690,00:40:21.12,00:40:21.12,I'll read the votes. First vote...
691,00:40:25.17,00:40:25.17,Eliza. Leann.
692,00:40:33.79,00:40:33.79,"One vote Eliza, one vote Leann. Eliza."

694,00:40:45.62,00:40:45.62,"Three votes Eliza, one vote Leann."
695,00:40:50.42,00:40:50.42,"Leann. Three votes Eliza, two votes"
696,00:40:54.42,00:40:54.42,Leann. Leann.
697,00:41:00.71,00:41:00.71,"We're tied. Three votes Leann, three votes"
698,00:41:03.75,00:41:03.75,Eliza. I'll read the last vote.
699,00:41:07.29,00:41:07.29,12th person voted out  of Survivor: Vanuatu:
700,00:41:11.96,00:41:11.96,Leann. Bring me your torch.
701,00:41:24.46,00:41:24.46,"Leann, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
702,00:41:42.12,00:41:42.12,"Well, as the last vote was read, there were some very"
703,00:41:45.04,00:41:45.04,smug looks; other faces were absolutely shocked.
704,00:41:49.12,00:41:49.12,"Nine days left, this game has just been turned on its head."
705,00:41:52.83,00:41:52.83,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
