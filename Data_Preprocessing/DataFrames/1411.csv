1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.42,00:00:02.42,"Survivor, Dreamz had to decide between two alliances: the four"
3,00:00:06.25,00:00:06.25,"horsemen or Earl, Yau-Man, and Cassandra."
4,00:00:09.96,00:00:09.96,">> I can never tell how the game is going to go, so I'm going to"
5,00:00:12.71,00:00:12.71,"just see how it plays out. >> PROBST: First, Dreamz warned"
6,00:00:16.50,00:00:16.50,Alex that he was on the chopping block.
7,00:00:18.58,00:00:18.58,">> Alex, your name's going to come up tomorrow."
8,00:00:20.04,00:00:20.04,>> PROBST: But Earl caught Dreamz red handed.
9,00:00:22.33,00:00:22.33,">> You know I heard what y'all was saying, right?"
10,00:00:24.25,00:00:24.25,">> PROBST: Feeling the pressure from Earl's alliance, Dreamz"
11,00:00:26.38,00:00:26.38,dropped a bomb about the four horsemen.
12,00:00:28.71,00:00:28.71,>> Mookie's got an immunity idol.
13,00:00:30.79,00:00:30.79,>> There are two hidden immunity idols.
14,00:00:33.92,00:00:33.92,The one in the Moto camp was dug up by me.
15,00:00:37.38,00:00:37.38,>> PROBST: In their first individual immunity challenge...
16,00:00:40.50,00:00:40.50,Yau-Man looks like he could go all day.
17,00:00:42.79,00:00:42.79,...Yau-Man obliterated the competition.
18,00:00:45.00,00:00:45.00,Boo is out of the challenge. Yau-Man wins first individual
19,00:00:47.75,00:00:47.75,immunity. Before tribal council....
20,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,>> Mookie wants to get rid of Earl first.
21,00:00:53.92,00:00:53.92,Are you in? >> PROBST: ...Alex tried to
22,00:00:55.54,00:00:55.54,recruit Stacy to join the four horsemen...
23,00:00:57.67,00:00:57.67,>> I'm just hot. I'm really agitated.
24,00:00:59.75,00:00:59.75,">> She was like, ""I'm just tired."
25,00:01:01.21,00:01:01.21,"I'm just hot right now."" >> That means that she's not in,"
26,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,dude. >> PROBST: ...which put Alex at
27,00:01:04.42,00:01:04.42,risk. >> I can save Alex by giving him
28,00:01:06.12,00:01:06.12,"the immunity idol, but this early in the game to use the"
29,00:01:08.33,00:01:08.33,immunity idol is kind of a disadvantage.
30,00:01:10.25,00:01:10.25,>> PROBST: Mookie reluctantly passed his hidden immunity idol
31,00:01:12.46,00:01:12.46,"to Alex in order to save him. >> It's going to work, Mook."
32,00:01:15.33,00:01:15.33,"It's going to work. >> PROBST: And together, they"
33,00:01:17.08,00:01:17.08,targeted Cassandra. >> This is an all-or-nothing
34,00:01:19.04,00:01:19.04,"move. If it works out, it'll probably"
35,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,be one of the best moves ever. >> Mookie gave Alex the idol.
36,00:01:24.67,00:01:24.67,>> PROBST: Dreamz let his new alliance know of the four
37,00:01:27.00,00:01:27.00,horsemen's plan. >> He gave it to him?
38,00:01:29.08,00:01:29.08,">> I promise. >> Listen-- Mookie, Mookie."
39,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,"Mookie gave the idol to Alex, so we're going to vote Mookie just"
40,00:01:37.12,00:01:37.12,to catch them off guard. >> Why don't we vote off
41,00:01:39.67,00:01:39.67,Edgardo? >> PROBST: But unwilling to
42,00:01:41.33,00:01:41.33,"fully trust Dreamz, the vote switched to Edgardo."
43,00:01:44.12,00:01:44.12,">> If we hit them with Edgardo, that hits them from the left"
44,00:01:46.08,00:01:46.08,"side. >> Yeah, I've thought about it."
45,00:01:48.25,00:01:48.25,">> PROBST: And at tribal council, Alex confidently played"
46,00:01:50.17,00:01:50.17,Mookie's idol. Alex is immune from tonight's
47,00:01:52.83,00:01:52.83,"vote. Alex, Mookie, and Edgardo were"
48,00:01:56.12,00:01:56.12,"certain their plan was working, but when the votes were"
49,00:01:59.12,00:01:59.12,revealed... Tenth person voted out and the
50,00:02:01.25,00:02:01.25,fourth member of our jury... ...the rug was pulled out from
51,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,"under them, and Edgardo was voted out."
52,00:02:06.92,00:02:06.92,"Edgardo, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left."
53,00:02:11.42,00:02:11.42,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Yeah.
54,00:02:37.96,00:02:37.96,>> I thought Dreamz would be more on par with the four
55,00:02:40.92,00:02:40.92,"horsemen alliance, but I guess not."
56,00:02:42.75,00:02:42.75,He's the one that turned and back-stabbed us.
57,00:02:44.33,00:02:44.33,"I mean, it hurts. >> Everybody made a pact to vote"
58,00:03:09.62,00:03:09.62,"out Mookie, and then all of a sudden they switched to Edgardo."
59,00:03:14.08,00:03:14.08,So I was the only one who voted Mookie.
60,00:03:16.25,00:03:16.25,"At first I felt like they didn't trust me, but then they came to"
61,00:03:18.67,00:03:18.67,me and they let me know that they just changed it just in
62,00:03:21.38,00:03:21.38,case Mookie pulled out the immunity idol.
63,00:03:24.04,00:03:24.04,And I was comfortable after that.
64,00:03:29.42,00:03:29.42,>> That was brilliant. Now the power is pretty much on
65,00:03:32.83,00:03:32.83,"our side, and I feel good. There ain't no more secrets now."
66,00:03:37.17,00:03:37.17,"We're actually six strong, and there's two people just waiting"
67,00:03:40.92,00:03:40.92,on death row. ( theme song playing )
68,00:04:31.46,00:04:31.46,>> ...come over and say something.
69,00:04:32.92,00:04:32.92,">> Like ""Hey, guys, you know, like, it's a game."""
70,00:04:34.50,00:04:34.50,>> A true traitor. >> Why are y'all not hanging out
71,00:04:46.12,00:04:46.12,no more? >> Why do you think?
72,00:04:51.88,00:04:51.88,>> I'm still hanging out. >> We all got outwitted?
73,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,What are you talking about? >> We all got outsmarted last
74,00:04:55.50,00:04:55.50,"night. >> Dude, you turned on us."
75,00:04:58.29,00:04:58.29,">> No, I didn't turn on y'all. >> How do you figure?"
76,00:05:00.50,00:05:00.50,>> I didn't turn on y'all. >> There were three votes for
77,00:05:02.42,00:05:02.42,"Cassandra. >> No, I didn't turn on y'all."
78,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,That's not even in me. >> Why didn't you go with
79,00:05:07.58,00:05:07.58,Cassandra anyway? >> Why didn't I go with
80,00:05:09.29,00:05:09.29,"Cassandra anyway? >> Yeah, that would have been a"
81,00:05:10.79,00:05:10.79,"4-4 split. >> It would have been 4-4, and"
82,00:05:12.29,00:05:12.29,"that was the end of it. We said Cassandra, and that was"
83,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,it. >> That was the end of it.
84,00:05:15.42,00:05:15.42,"As soon as you voted for Edgardo, that was the end of us."
85,00:05:16.96,00:05:16.96,>> What? >> Or you voted for me?
86,00:05:18.96,00:05:18.96,">> Who'd you vote for, Mookie or Edgardo?"
87,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67,>> I voted Mookie. I didn't throw Mookie's random
88,00:05:23.08,00:05:23.08,name out randomly and turn on y'all.
89,00:05:25.79,00:05:25.79,"But I knew once they had us gone, it's me trying to go with"
90,00:05:28.25,00:05:28.25,them. It's not me turning on y'all
91,00:05:30.04,00:05:30.04,"ever, ever. I walked over to Mookie and Alex"
92,00:05:35.92,00:05:35.92,"and said, ""I guess we just got outplayed,"" because I want them"
93,00:05:39.00,00:05:39.00,to think that it wasn't my fault that it happened.
94,00:05:42.58,00:05:42.58,I pretty much told them a story about me not knowing about what
95,00:05:45.79,00:05:45.79,was going on. I didn't turn.
96,00:05:49.25,00:05:49.25,>> That's the only thing that was upsetting to me.
97,00:05:51.04,00:05:51.04,"If I get jacked, I get jacked. But to be turned on, I was like,"
98,00:05:54.88,00:05:54.88,"""Man, I can't believe that guy turned on me."""
99,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,">> I didn't go, ""Oh, yeah, Alex got the immunity idol, don't"
100,00:06:00.12,00:06:00.12,"vote for him; vote for Edgardo."" >> Is there a way out of this"
101,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,right now? >> One of y'all win the
102,00:06:05.25,00:06:05.25,challenge. All y'all can do now is win
103,00:06:07.25,00:06:07.25,challenges. As fast as I'm trying to get
104,00:06:09.92,00:06:09.92,"them out of here, I still want to be their friends, because I'm"
105,00:06:12.25,00:06:12.25,going to need their vote in the future if I one of the final
106,00:06:14.04,00:06:14.04,two. I got a headache and everything
107,00:06:15.71,00:06:15.71,"at tribal council. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
108,00:06:36.21,00:06:36.21,"For today's challenge, you're going to be randomly divided"
109,00:06:39.25,00:06:39.25,into two teams. One person from each team will
110,00:06:43.21,00:06:43.21,be on a platform. You will be launching balls out
111,00:06:46.33,00:06:46.33,"into the field, where your teammates will run, slide, or"
112,00:06:49.71,00:06:49.71,"dive in the mud, attempting to catch the ball using a catch"
113,00:06:53.62,00:06:53.62,"basket. Each time you catch a ball, you"
114,00:06:56.42,00:06:56.42,score a point. It doesn't matter what color
115,00:06:59.21,00:06:59.21,"ball you catch. You catch a ball, you score a"
116,00:07:01.96,00:07:01.96,point. First team to five wins reward.
117,00:07:05.79,00:07:05.79,Want to know what you're playing for?
118,00:07:07.54,00:07:07.54,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Some items to get you
119,00:07:10.54,00:07:10.54,"nice and clean. Trust me, all eight of you need"
120,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,this desperately. You will not take this back to
121,00:07:18.04,00:07:18.04,"camp to get clean, though. You will take this basket."
122,00:07:20.88,00:07:20.88,You will board a seaplane. The seaplane will fly you to a
123,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,"luxury spa resort. >> Oh, God."
124,00:07:27.88,00:07:27.88,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: When you arrive,"
125,00:07:29.58,00:07:29.58,"you'll take a shower, put this Olay ribbons body wash to use."
126,00:07:32.71,00:07:32.71,"You'll then spend the night, get a good night's sleep in a bed,"
127,00:07:35.54,00:07:35.54,"return to camp in the morning. In addition, the winning team"
128,00:07:39.21,00:07:39.21,will send one person from the losing team to Exile Island.
129,00:07:43.96,00:07:43.96,The person who goes to Exile will find a new clue to the
130,00:07:47.25,00:07:47.25,"location of the hidden immunity idol, which has been rehidden"
131,00:07:50.96,00:07:50.96,since Alex played it at the last tribal council.
132,00:07:54.79,00:07:54.79,"All right, we're going to randomly draw for teams, and"
133,00:07:56.54,00:07:56.54,we'll get started. Here we go.
134,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,"For the orange team, it is Yau-Man launching balls to Boo,"
135,00:08:07.62,00:08:07.62,"Cassandra, and Mookie. For the green team, launching"
136,00:08:11.54,00:08:11.54,"the balls is Stacy. Out in the field, it is Dreamz,"
137,00:08:15.29,00:08:15.29,"Earl, and Alex. Let's get this challenge"
138,00:08:19.12,00:08:19.12,"started. Three, two, one, fire."
139,00:08:25.71,00:08:25.71,"Yau-Man launches deep, nobody going to get it."
140,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,Stacy waiting. She launches.
141,00:08:30.83,00:08:30.83,Everybody going for it. >> Oh!
142,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,">> PROBST: Earl has it, and he loses it-- no points."
143,00:08:35.50,00:08:35.50,>> I didn't know they bounced like that.
144,00:08:37.58,00:08:37.58,">> PROBST: Three, two, one, launch."
145,00:08:42.67,00:08:42.67,Boo scores for orange! Mookie steals it for the orange
146,00:08:50.21,00:08:50.21,"team. >> Sorry, sorry."
147,00:08:53.50,00:08:53.50,">> PROBST: Quickly, orange leads two-zip."
148,00:08:58.12,00:08:58.12,"Three, two, one, fire. Alex makes a diving attempt but"
149,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,cannot hold on to it. >> Good try.
150,00:09:12.17,00:09:12.17,>> PROBST: What did I miss? >> Choke hold.
151,00:09:14.92,00:09:14.92,>> PROBST: This is up to you guys to figure out how physical
152,00:09:17.17,00:09:17.17,"you want to get. Ready, aim, fire."
153,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,Yau-Man goes short for Boo. Stacy high and deep.
154,00:09:29.25,00:09:29.25,Dreamz has a shot. Dreamz connects for green!
155,00:09:32.50,00:09:32.50,"Orange leads now 2-1. Three, two, one, fire."
156,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,Stacy launches deep for Dreamz. Mookie almost steals it!
157,00:09:46.21,00:09:46.21,Yau-Man launches deep. >> Ow!
158,00:09:51.38,00:09:51.38,Ow! Ow!
159,00:09:55.79,00:09:55.79,">> Are you all right? >> PROBST: What happened, Boo?"
160,00:09:57.75,00:09:57.75,>> Ow! ( Boo groaning )
161,00:10:02.83,00:10:02.83,">> PROBST: What happened, Boo? >> I think it's my ACL or"
162,00:10:05.25,00:10:05.25,something. >> Take your time.
163,00:10:08.50,00:10:08.50,Take your time. ( Boo groaning )
164,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,>> PROBST: Let's bring medical in.
165,00:10:15.42,00:10:15.42,( Boo groaning ) >> In the back?
166,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,">> Yeah, yeah, right in there. >> Oh, man."
167,00:10:44.12,00:10:44.12,( knee popping ) >> Ooh!
168,00:10:45.96,00:10:45.96,">> Oh, man. >> I can hear that."
169,00:10:53.88,00:10:53.88,>> I'm good. I'm good.
170,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,Let's go. Let's go!
171,00:10:58.83,00:10:58.83,>> PROBST: You want to keep going?
172,00:11:00.46,00:11:00.46,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: All right."
173,00:11:02.08,00:11:02.08,>> It was painful. That's all.
174,00:11:03.42,00:11:03.42,It's gone. The pain subsided.
175,00:11:05.50,00:11:05.50,>> PROBST: Boo going to keep going.
176,00:11:07.54,00:11:07.54,"Three, two, one, fire. Boo battling for it and loses"
177,00:11:14.12,00:11:14.12,it! Dreamz scores for green!
178,00:11:22.12,00:11:22.12,>> Yau! >> PROBST: We are now tied 2-2.
179,00:11:27.46,00:11:27.46,"Three, two, one, fire. Stacy's in the air."
180,00:11:34.96,00:11:34.96,Yau-Man goes short. Mookie connects!
181,00:11:38.79,00:11:38.79,"Orange back in the lead. Three, two..."
182,00:11:42.67,00:11:42.67,">> Earl, get physical! >> I am physical."
183,00:11:45.58,00:11:45.58,It's about the placement of the balls.
184,00:11:48.12,00:11:48.12,">> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire. First ball in the air, Dreamz"
185,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,"going for it, and he has it! Boo almost had it."
186,00:12:01.46,00:12:01.46,">> Come on, man! >> PROBST: We are tied 3-3."
187,00:12:07.04,00:12:07.04,"Three, two, one, fire. Alex has a shot at it."
188,00:12:19.42,00:12:19.42,Yau-Man going way left to Mookie.

190,00:12:27.25,00:12:27.25,"We are at game point. Orange scores one more point,"
191,00:12:30.88,00:12:30.88,"they're going to a spa. >> Yau, patience."
192,00:12:34.88,00:12:34.88,"Just watch the break. >> PROBST: Three, two, one,"
193,00:12:37.58,00:12:37.58,fire. Yau-Man goes right back to the
194,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,same target. Alex steals it for the green
195,00:12:44.04,00:12:44.04,team. Stacy goes deep for Dreamz.
196,00:12:51.58,00:12:51.58,"Boo with the good deflection, does not score."
197,00:12:54.25,00:12:54.25,We are tied 4-4. Next catch wins it.
198,00:12:59.21,00:12:59.21,"Three, two, one, launch. Boo has a shot at it, just"
199,00:13:07.33,00:13:07.33,misses. >> Dreamz!
200,00:13:14.50,00:13:14.50,>> PROBST: Dreamz has it. Green scores!
201,00:13:17.46,00:13:17.46,"Green wins reward! Earl, Dreamz, Alex, and Stacy"
202,00:13:23.42,00:13:23.42,"going on a spa reward. All right first big decision,"
203,00:13:31.42,00:13:31.42,"Alex, Stacy, Dreamz, and Earl, you have to send one person to"
204,00:13:34.92,00:13:34.92,Exile Island. >> Boo.
205,00:13:37.54,00:13:37.54,">> He's been living the life of luxury since he's been here, so"
206,00:13:39.04,00:13:39.04,"he has to go. >> PROBST: Boo, head on out."
207,00:13:41.79,00:13:41.79,"The boat will pick you up. >> Good luck, Boo."
208,00:13:45.25,00:13:45.25,">> PROBST: Big reward. >> Big, huge!"
209,00:13:48.00,00:13:48.00,>> PROBST: Come grab your stuff. Head on out this way.
210,00:13:50.38,00:13:50.38,The seaplane will pick you up. >> Right now?

214,00:14:13.67,00:14:13.67,It's not here. It's not my beach.
215,00:14:15.71,00:14:15.71,"That makes it a lot easier for me here, because I don't want to"
216,00:14:18.00,00:14:18.00,"do anything. I hurt my knee, and it's"
217,00:14:20.12,00:14:20.12,painful. I'm out of water right now.
218,00:14:23.83,00:14:23.83,"I'm nearing heat exhaustion. Man, I cannot be in the sun"
219,00:14:27.50,00:14:27.50,anymore. I'm going to die.

221,00:14:41.54,00:14:41.54,when I get to this reward is see if I can wiggle my way back into

223,00:14:47.12,00:14:47.12,"position, and I feel like odds are against me."
224,00:14:49.96,00:14:49.96,>> Bula-Bula! >> Bula-Bula!
225,00:14:51.67,00:14:51.67,">> Bula! >> But, hey, I'm definitely"
226,00:14:53.58,00:14:53.58,"going to give it my all. >> Hey, let's go ahead and get"
227,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,sexy back. We got the showers.
228,00:15:10.83,00:15:10.83,">> There's, like, so much dirt in so many places, I don't know"
229,00:15:13.29,00:15:13.29,what to do. >> Warm water.
230,00:15:18.08,00:15:18.08,">> Oh, wow, this feels great. >> I have mud under my arms."
231,00:15:23.12,00:15:23.12,How crazy is that? Mud!
232,00:15:26.71,00:15:26.71,">> Time to Olay-- Olay, Olay. Oh, my God, I'm clean again,"
233,00:15:31.83,00:15:31.83,"like human. >> I don't know, Alex."
234,00:15:34.71,00:15:34.71,I think I'm getting my sexy back.
235,00:15:37.75,00:15:37.75,>> Thank you very much. >> Thank you.
236,00:15:40.75,00:15:40.75,">> Looks good, smells good. >> Enjoy."
237,00:15:43.79,00:15:43.79,">> Getting the reward was good, and it was definitely good for"

239,00:15:49.17,00:15:49.17,platter and that as well. >> But it was extremely awkward
240,00:15:52.25,00:15:52.25,"to have Alex there. >> I mean, you've seen how I"
241,00:15:54.38,00:15:54.38,"play this game. Whether I win or lose, I"
242,00:15:56.21,00:15:56.21,"congratulate the other team, and I try to minimize, like, the"
243,00:15:59.25,00:15:59.25,showboating. >> Sometimes.
244,00:16:06.58,00:16:06.58,>> A lion is most dangerous when he's wounded and backed up
245,00:16:09.12,00:16:09.12,"against a wall. That's how I feel, because I'm"
246,00:16:11.29,00:16:11.29,clearly on the chopping block. So if I can buy myself a couple
247,00:16:15.21,00:16:15.21,"people off, that might give me more time to try to maybe"
248,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,infiltrate the alliance. >> Yeah!
249,00:16:22.25,00:16:22.25,">> Yeah! So can I ask you a question,"
250,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,Earl? >> Sure.
251,00:16:25.75,00:16:25.75,">> So what's the order, Mookie and I?"
252,00:16:29.38,00:16:29.38,">> That information probably wouldn't be revealed, because"
253,00:16:32.62,00:16:32.62,the game isn't over. >> Fair enough.
254,00:16:35.08,00:16:35.08,>> Can't be stupid. >> Fair enough.
255,00:16:37.08,00:16:37.08,>> I'm assuming you want to go second.
256,00:16:38.79,00:16:38.79,>> I think Mookie wants to go. >> Sounds reasonable to me.
257,00:16:47.29,00:16:47.29,"But I've come to terms with the way I've played the game so far,"
258,00:16:51.08,00:16:51.08,"and I'm happy. Obviously, I'm at a"
259,00:16:53.33,00:16:53.33,"disadvantage, but I don't care. I'm not going down without a"
260,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,"fight, you know, and they the better be prepared forward me to"
261,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,bring it at this point. >> Get out of our seats!
262,00:17:16.79,00:17:16.79,We're ready to get on! >> So fresh and so clean.
263,00:17:20.08,00:17:20.08,">> We can smell you from here! >> Clean, washed, pressed."
264,00:17:24.46,00:17:24.46,">> When the people came back from the spa reward, they"
265,00:17:26.88,00:17:26.88,smelled like apples and strawberries.
266,00:17:30.04,00:17:30.04,>> Let me smell you! Let me smell you!
267,00:17:32.21,00:17:32.21,">> I know, I smell good. >> Yes, their trip was great,"
268,00:17:36.04,00:17:36.04,but I just hate hearing it. You're back to your standard of
269,00:17:39.29,00:17:39.29,"living you're used to, dirt. At this point, I'm already x'd"
270,00:17:43.88,00:17:43.88,"out of the equation of everyone, but even though I seem like I'm"
271,00:17:48.12,00:17:48.12,"out of the game, I'm just completely out, my heart is"
272,00:17:50.62,00:17:50.62,"still going, and my mind is constantly just thinking."
273,00:17:58.38,00:17:58.38,I think Yau-Man found it. >> The idol.
274,00:18:01.25,00:18:01.25,>> Yau-Man found it because he's the only person that's ever at
275,00:18:04.29,00:18:04.29,camp. >> Ever.
276,00:18:06.12,00:18:06.12,>> Ever. >> Always by the fire.
277,00:18:07.88,00:18:07.88,">> And he's always by the fire, and he always has time, so he"
278,00:18:09.92,00:18:09.92,has it. When your back is against the
279,00:18:12.50,00:18:12.50,"wall, you start being creative. And I thought, ""Hmm, the idol, I"
280,00:18:16.17,00:18:16.17,"wonder who really has the idol."" So I decided, ""Well, Yau-Man's"
281,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,"fishing, the first time he's ever been away from camp; I"
282,00:18:23.17,00:18:23.17,might as well go check his bag to see if there's anything in
283,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,"there,"" just being curious. Where's Yau-Man's bag?"
284,00:18:30.33,00:18:30.33,Did he take it with him? This is it right here?
285,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,"Yup, he has it. >> Are you serious?"
286,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,">> Yeah, he's got it. It's right here."
287,00:18:38.96,00:18:38.96,Look. >> What can we do with that
288,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,information? Do we blow up his spot?
289,00:18:46.29,00:18:46.29,>> We can do something with this information.
290,00:18:48.17,00:18:48.17,>> We can do something with this information.
291,00:18:49.58,00:18:49.58,Let's go think what is the most damage we can cause.
292,00:18:54.04,00:18:54.04,>> I'm doing this because you and me are the last two girls.
293,00:18:56.75,00:18:56.75,>> This is to a long and prosperous game together.
294,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,>> Cheers. >> That's why you don't hide the
295,00:19:03.17,00:19:03.17,immunity idol in your bag. ( laughter )
296,00:19:08.12,00:19:08.12,>> I hear somebody coming. >> It's Yau-Man's best interest
297,00:19:12.79,00:19:12.79,"not to align himself with us, though, because we know he has"
298,00:19:15.25,00:19:15.25,it. Because there's no reason why he
299,00:19:19.71,00:19:19.71,"would tell anybody yet, right? >> There's nothing for his"
300,00:19:22.25,00:19:22.25,position. How are you going to convince
301,00:19:25.08,00:19:25.08,everyone that Yau-Man has the idol?
302,00:19:26.67,00:19:26.67,">> Let's think about that. >> Say, ""I went in his bag."
303,00:19:29.38,00:19:29.38,"He has the idol."" ""You guys went fishing, I went"
304,00:19:31.62,00:19:31.62,"in his bag, he has the idol, period."""
305,00:19:38.25,00:19:38.25,>> He wears those pants to tribal all the time.
306,00:19:41.08,00:19:41.08,"""Yau-Man, do you have the idol?"" He's like, ""No, I don't have the"
307,00:19:43.67,00:19:43.67,"idol."" ""Pull your pants out and show"
308,00:19:45.92,00:19:45.92,"everyone here that you have the idol if you're so confident."""
309,00:19:48.04,00:19:48.04,>> Just blow up his spot at tribal.
310,00:19:49.04,00:19:49.04,">> Right there, be like, ""Throw it up."""
311,00:19:50.75,00:19:50.75,"At tribal council, that's like... if you blew him up on"
312,00:19:53.71,00:19:53.71,"the spot like that, and he had it in his pocket, and then he"
313,00:19:56.12,00:19:56.12,lied to everyone saying he didn't have it...
314,00:19:58.46,00:19:58.46,>> They would vote with us. >> Exactly.
315,00:20:02.21,00:20:02.21,">> God, it's going to be so great!"
316,00:20:03.46,00:20:03.46,"Even if we get voted off, Mook, it's going to feel so great!"
317,00:20:07.12,00:20:07.12,"That's going to feel so... ah! That's going out swinging,"
318,00:20:10.96,00:20:10.96,literally a blaze of glory. >> Scarface.
319,00:20:14.71,00:20:14.71,>> Scarface style. >> Two great brains working
320,00:20:20.54,00:20:20.54,"together, strategizing, we're on top of the world."
321,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,">> Ah, brilliant. >> We devised this huge plan of"
322,00:20:26.75,00:20:26.75,maybe we can bring up the idol to everyone and surprise them at
323,00:20:31.21,00:20:31.21,"tribal council, then people won't be able to talk to each"
324,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,other and people will be paranoid; they don't know what
325,00:20:37.21,00:20:37.21,to do. It's going to be an interesting
326,00:20:39.04,00:20:39.04,"tribal council, let me tell you that."
327,00:20:40.33,00:20:40.33,>> It is. ( laughter )
328,00:20:44.12,00:20:44.12,( twig breaks ) >> What?
329,00:20:50.58,00:20:50.58,>> Stacy and Cassandra are right there.
330,00:20:55.38,00:20:55.38,>> We're screwed. That's it.
331,00:20:58.33,00:20:58.33,They're going to tell Yau-Man. >> There goes that plan.
332,00:21:02.00,00:21:02.00,">> Damn it, dude! >> Right now the biggest thing"
333,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,is we need to blow his spot up. >> We blow up his spot before
334,00:21:06.08,00:21:06.08,tribal council. >> We blow it up now.
335,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,">> We got to hurry up and go there then, before they go."
336,00:21:17.25,00:21:17.25,Time to raise some hell. >> Once I saw Stacy and
337,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,"Cassandra listening to our conversation, I came up with a"
338,00:21:30.88,00:21:30.88,little idea that if we can get back to Yau before them and kind
339,00:21:34.21,00:21:34.21,"of give him an ultimatum, that we can somehow use that"
340,00:21:37.08,00:21:37.08,information against him in his alliance.
341,00:21:43.46,00:21:43.46,">> I think they may be a little paranoid, thinking we were"
342,00:21:46.17,00:21:46.17,eavesdropping in on them. >> Cassandra and I happened to
343,00:21:50.08,00:21:50.08,be sitting nearby where Mookie and Alex were having a
344,00:21:55.17,00:21:55.17,conversation that they spoke about a few things that we
345,00:21:57.67,00:21:57.67,"didn't hear. We heard, like, words here and"
346,00:22:00.04,00:22:00.04,there. So then they went running back
347,00:22:01.92,00:22:01.92,"to camp. >> Now, do you want to tell the"
348,00:22:11.54,00:22:11.54,"group yourself, or do you want us to do it?"
349,00:22:13.21,00:22:13.21,>> Why do I have the idol? >> I thought you guys were
350,00:22:21.96,00:22:21.96,getting firewood. >> No.
351,00:22:24.54,00:22:24.54,">> So what do you want to do, Yau?"
352,00:22:27.67,00:22:27.67,>> You guys do what you need to do.
353,00:22:30.54,00:22:30.54,">> Okay, we will. >> All right."
354,00:22:37.08,00:22:37.08,">> So we go to Yau-Man, and he was shocked."
355,00:22:39.12,00:22:39.12,"I definitely saw it in his eyes, like, ""Holy crap."""
356,00:22:41.29,00:22:41.29,He's not going to be able to now use the idol the way he wanted
357,00:22:43.17,00:22:43.17,to. So that still makes him more of
358,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33,"a target than it did before. It'll be interesting, won't it?"
359,00:23:00.75,00:23:00.75,>> Earl is the only one who knows I have the idol.
360,00:23:03.46,00:23:03.46,"At this point, it doesn't change any outcome, because my voting"
361,00:23:07.62,00:23:07.62,"bloc members, we already have decided, we have the majority to"
362,00:23:11.21,00:23:11.21,continue the sequence that we are going to.
363,00:23:14.62,00:23:14.62,"It changed somewhat for me, personally, because having that"
364,00:23:18.25,00:23:18.25,information that early put me at risk.
365,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,So I will have to tell all my voting bloc just straight out.
366,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,">> He went through your bag, Yau-Man?"
367,00:23:39.83,00:23:39.83,">> He went through my bag. They're trying to threaten me,"
368,00:23:41.17,00:23:41.17,basically. He didn't say that.
369,00:23:42.96,00:23:42.96,"He implies that, pretty much. >> My heart is, like, hurting"
370,00:23:46.75,00:23:46.75,right now. Alex went through Yau-Man's
371,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,"things, his bag, his pants, and then threatened him."
372,00:23:53.88,00:23:53.88,">> He threatened you? >> He threatened him and said,"

424,00:27:11.08,00:27:11.08,You don't know anybody else's. So this is a little bit of a

491,00:32:15.92,00:32:15.92,I know what it's like to negotiate with people.
492,00:32:17.62,00:32:17.62,"I know what it's like to use information strategically, which"
493,00:32:19.62,00:32:19.62,"I've been doing all along. You know, it's very clear."
494,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,"Hey, Yau-Man can't be trusted. So at tonight's tribal council,"
495,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,"I'm going to point it out as ""Hey, these are the people"

500,00:33:29.46,00:33:29.46,"Island, and he had one clue to the hidden immunity idol, and I"
501,00:33:34.58,00:33:34.58,think Boo somehow convinced Cassandra or whoever that Alex
502,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,or Mookie may have found it somehow.
503,00:33:42.00,00:33:42.00,They're afraid that Alex will pull another one out.
504,00:33:44.88,00:33:44.88,So they're going to try and spread the vote out.
505,00:34:01.67,00:34:01.67,">> Yeah, yeah. >> People want to do three votes"
506,00:34:06.79,00:34:06.79,"Mookie and three votes Alex, and the reason for that was just you"
507,00:34:11.71,00:34:11.71,never know what might pop up. That will make it a tie at
508,00:34:14.92,00:34:14.92,"tribal council. So at that point, we can make a"
509,00:34:17.50,00:34:17.50,choice. We know that no magical idol has
510,00:34:19.38,00:34:19.38,"been played, because there won't be anything played, and we can"
511,00:34:21.46,00:34:21.46,"say okay, ""It's going to be Alex, that's who is going to"
512,00:34:23.62,00:34:23.62,"go,"" because that is who's going to go."
513,00:34:26.62,00:34:26.62,">> Ready? One, two, three."
514,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,">> I'm against doing a split vote, but you know, I do what"
515,00:34:33.08,00:34:33.08,makes people feel comfortable. I'm not going to sit there and
516,00:34:35.62,00:34:35.62,"say, ""No, guys, we're going to do this,"" because that would be"
517,00:34:37.29,00:34:37.29,"the wrong approach. >> Tonight's tribal council,"
518,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,Mookie and I are going out swinging.
519,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,"And if that doesn't work, I think my best bet is to just try"
520,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,"to stay alive past this vote. I've got one vote, and I better"
521,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,make it count. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
522,00:35:12.17,00:35:12.17,"the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, and Edgardo, voted out at the"
523,00:35:20.88,00:35:20.88,last tribal council. Let's start with the reward
524,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,"challenge. Alex, did you sense the game"
525,00:35:32.75,00:35:32.75,shift at all? There were a lot of physical
526,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17,"match-ups, a lot of people yelling at each other."
527,00:35:38.12,00:35:38.12,">> I don't know if it changed the game, but it definitely"
528,00:35:41.54,00:35:41.54,revealed something about the way people are willing to play
529,00:35:43.75,00:35:43.75,"games, you know, if they're more likely to rub mud in someone's"
530,00:35:46.62,00:35:46.62,eyes or trip somebody. And as Dreamz pointed out last
531,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,"tribal council, the rats and the snakes came out of the woodwork."
532,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,">> PROBST: Mookie, what did you notice from that challenge?"
533,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,">> I think, to some extent, we respect each other."
534,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,"But then, when it comes down to the game and how are you going"
535,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,"to win, it's a little different. I mean, there's two sides to the"
536,00:36:04.25,00:36:04.25,story there. >> PROBST: Tell me about the
537,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"other side. >> There are alliances, and one"
538,00:36:08.92,00:36:08.92,alliance was completely destroyed at the last tribal
539,00:36:11.29,00:36:11.29,"council, maybe some back stabbing and maybe some"
540,00:36:14.21,00:36:14.21,trickiness on the other alliance's part.
541,00:36:16.54,00:36:16.54,"But at that point, you feel yourself just being an outsider"
542,00:36:19.42,00:36:19.42,"to an alliance. >> PROBST: So, Mookie, what do"
543,00:36:22.08,00:36:22.08,"you do? >> You know, Alex and I, we"
544,00:36:25.25,00:36:25.25,realized our backs are against the wall with no way out.
545,00:36:27.46,00:36:27.46,"You know, we've come up with some kind of way we can possibly"
546,00:36:30.21,00:36:30.21,"get out, and that was through an immunity idol that we found in"
547,00:36:35.00,00:36:35.00,"one of the... in Yau-Man's bag. >> PROBST: Hold on, you found an"
548,00:36:38.71,00:36:38.71,immunity idol in Yau-Man's bag. >> Correct.
549,00:36:42.42,00:36:42.42,">> PROBST: Found it? >> Well, it was in his bag,"
550,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,yeah. >> PROBST: This is coming on the
551,00:36:48.83,00:36:48.83,heels of Alex saying the snakes and the rats came out.
552,00:36:51.46,00:36:51.46,"That's about as snaky-ratty as it gets, going through"
553,00:36:54.83,00:36:54.83,"somebody's personal belongings. Yau-Man, is that fair-- that ""If"
554,00:36:57.88,00:36:57.88,"you're going something in your bag and leave, you better know I"

556,00:37:02.58,00:37:02.58,"there's some privacy, but on the other hand, you know, it's a"
557,00:37:05.21,00:37:05.21,"desperation move, and besides, it won't affect the outcome of"
558,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,the game for the next few rounds.
559,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,">> PROBST: Well, that's a bold statement."
560,00:37:13.17,00:37:13.17,It won't affect the game for the next few rounds?
561,00:37:15.46,00:37:15.46,>> Couple rounds at least. I may have to change my strategy
562,00:37:18.46,00:37:18.46,"a little bit, if I, you know, intend to use it at some point."
563,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,">> PROBST: Earl, what was the reaction when this all went"
564,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,down? >> I was pissed.
565,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,"Like, for one thing, I can say that this tribe, no one's going"
566,00:37:28.25,00:37:28.25,through anybody's stuff. That just hasn't been going on.
567,00:37:31.25,00:37:31.25,"So when I heard that, you know, I was pissed off."
568,00:37:34.29,00:37:34.29,">> PROBST: Dreamz, how big an issue is trust?-- because it's"
569,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,hard to know who has been lying all along.
570,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,">> My take on this is if they're both on the chopping block,"
571,00:37:43.92,00:37:43.92,"after they're gone, it's still going to be six of us left."
572,00:37:47.04,00:37:47.04,So we're going to split up too. So I'm trying to find out where
573,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"I stand. >> PROBST: Alex, are there"
574,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,people coasting in this game that are threats and aren't seen
575,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,as threats? >> Yeah.
576,00:37:57.62,00:37:57.62,"And at this point, if Mookie and I are gone, and there are six"
577,00:38:00.04,00:38:00.04,"people left, and they have to look at each other-- so whatever"
578,00:38:03.33,00:38:03.33,they did to get to that top six is going to come back and bite
579,00:38:06.58,00:38:06.58,them in the ass. Karma has a funny way of working
580,00:38:08.96,00:38:08.96,"in this game, Jeff, and it's pretty immediate."
581,00:38:11.04,00:38:11.04,"You know, whatever will be will be, but word to the wise:"
582,00:38:14.00,00:38:14.00,"remember past actions, because they foretell the future."
583,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
584,00:38:22.25,00:38:22.25,"Based on tonight's tribal council, we know there is"
585,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,another hidden immunity idol in play.
586,00:38:26.92,00:38:26.92,"Whoever has it, if you need to use it tonight, you would"
587,00:38:29.25,00:38:29.25,present it to me before I read the votes.
588,00:38:31.54,00:38:31.54,"Stacy, you have individual immunity."
589,00:38:34.21,00:38:34.21,Are you going hold on to it? >> Yeah.
590,00:38:35.79,00:38:35.79,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Stacy.
591,00:38:37.29,00:38:37.29,Everybody else is fair game. Time to vote.
592,00:38:40.21,00:38:40.21,"Earl, you're up. >> Nothing personal."
593,00:39:00.83,00:39:00.83,Someone needs to go. >> Just trying to stay in this
594,00:39:19.54,00:39:19.54,"another day, buddy. Good luck."
595,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
596,00:39:39.58,00:39:39.58,"If you have the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,"
597,00:39:41.88,00:39:41.88,"now is the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
598,00:39:51.96,00:39:51.96,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
599,00:39:54.04,00:39:54.04,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
600,00:39:57.71,00:39:57.71,First vote: Alex. Alex.
601,00:40:05.08,00:40:05.08,Two votes Alex. Mookie.
602,00:40:14.50,00:40:14.50,Boo. One vote Boo.
603,00:40:20.21,00:40:20.21,"Mookie. That's two votes Mookie, two"
604,00:40:23.42,00:40:23.42,"votes Alex, one vote Boo. Mookie."
605,00:40:29.42,00:40:29.42,That's three votes Mookie. Alex.
606,00:40:35.62,00:40:35.62,"We're tied. Three votes Mookie, three votes"
607,00:40:39.08,00:40:39.08,"Alex, one vote left. Eleventh person voted out and"
608,00:40:48.12,00:40:48.12,"the fifth member of our jury, Mookie."
609,00:40:51.42,00:40:51.42,"You need to bring me your torch. Mookie, the tribe has spoken."
610,00:41:05.46,00:41:05.46,Time for you to go. >> Good luck.
611,00:41:18.88,00:41:18.88,">> PROBST: Well, based on what I heard tonight, it sounds like"
612,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,"there's one very strong group of six and Alex, which means Alex"
613,00:41:25.75,00:41:25.75,is either odd man out or suddenly very valuable.
614,00:41:28.92,00:41:28.92,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
615,00:41:32.12,00:41:32.12,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
616,00:41:45.50,00:41:45.50,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
617,00:41:52.88,00:41:52.88,"Survivor, Alex goes undercover. >> I'm trying to make sure I'm"
618,00:41:56.25,00:41:56.25,"not seen or heard, kind of like a ninja right now."
619,00:41:58.92,00:41:58.92,>> PROBST: Boo annoys everyone. >> He talks more than the girls
620,00:42:00.92,00:42:00.92,talk. >> Y'all know what I was
621,00:42:02.33,00:42:02.33,"thinking. I was like, ""Would you shut up?"
622,00:42:03.92,00:42:03.92,"Why don't you stop saying stupid stuff?"""
623,00:42:06.17,00:42:06.17,>> PROBST: And the reward challenge gets primal.
624,00:42:08.46,00:42:08.46,"This is a free-for-all. >> You know, I'm pretty relieved"
625,00:42:17.75,00:42:17.75,"that I'm out of the game, but at the same time, it would have"
626,00:42:20.08,00:42:20.08,been nice to still be in the game had the alliances stayed
627,00:42:22.21,00:42:22.21,put for me. And I wish I could be back
628,00:42:23.92,00:42:23.92,"there, raising hell, making everyone's lives miserable, as"
629,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,miserable as my life has been here.
630,00:42:27.92,00:42:27.92,It's kind of like grass is green on the other side.
631,00:42:29.88,00:42:29.88,"You know, it's unfortunate that I'm out of the game, but it was"
632,00:42:32.04,00:42:32.04,"a great experience, and I wouldn't take it back for"
633,00:42:34.12,00:42:34.12,anything.
