3,00:00:04.47,00:00:04.47,took its toll. >> Dehydration may be our
4,00:00:06.63,00:00:06.63,biggest concern. >> PROBST: A mystery box with
5,00:00:08.60,00:00:08.60,three locks was discovered at tree mail.
6,00:00:10.93,00:00:10.93,>> Oh-oh. We see a big crate.
7,00:00:13.20,00:00:13.20,We have no idea what's inside. >> It feels like something
8,00:00:16.00,00:00:16.00,"substantial, whatever it is. >> PROBST: At the reward"

11,00:00:24.63,00:00:24.63,between blankets or flint to make fire and a clue to the

13,00:00:31.03,00:00:31.03,"rice. >> Oh, man."
14,00:00:32.70,00:00:32.70,">> PROBST: There's a rub. If you choose the flint, Mogo"

17,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,flint and gave all three tribes fire.
18,00:00:41.80,00:00:41.80,>> Fire! Yay! >> PROBST: At Saboga...
19,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33,>> My foot sort of makes me limp a little.
20,00:00:47.43,00:00:47.43,>> Rudy's not doing okay. His feet-- he did something to
21,00:00:51.47,00:00:51.47,the bone inside. >> PROBST: At the immunity

23,00:00:56.27,00:00:56.27,Saboga's still bailing water! When they finish a distant

25,00:01:01.47,00:01:01.47,Saboga going to Tribal Council. Rudy's injury and Ethan's status
26,00:01:04.90,00:01:04.90,as a previous winner put both of them on the chopping block.
27,00:01:08.47,00:01:08.47,"But when the votes came in, it was Rudy who took the fall."
28,00:01:11.87,00:01:11.87,"Rudy, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left."

31,00:02:54.87,00:02:54.87,"And, you know, my problem is that I couldn't resist the urge"
32,00:02:58.60,00:02:58.60,"to scratch them. It was more than I could bear,"
33,00:03:01.33,00:03:01.33,and now I'm definitely paying for it because I think that
34,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,"they get way, way worse when you scratch them."
35,00:03:07.73,00:03:07.73,"They raise up and they become kind of like little open sores,"
36,00:03:10.70,00:03:10.70,open wounds. And then the salt water gets
37,00:03:12.70,00:03:12.70,into them and it feels like fire.
38,00:03:15.17,00:03:15.17,"It's horrible. >> Honey, you're going to get"
39,00:03:21.80,00:03:21.80,scars. >> I'm not scratching them.
40,00:03:24.10,00:03:24.10,I'm just rubbing. Ugh!
41,00:03:26.13,00:03:26.13,This is bad. They're like bug bites on top of
42,00:03:29.27,00:03:29.27,bug bites on top of... We look like freaks.
43,00:03:31.83,00:03:31.83,Bigger freaks than we already are.
44,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57,">> You cannot be itching yourself, girl."
45,00:03:35.30,00:03:35.30,We talked about that. >> I can't stop myself.
46,00:03:37.07,00:03:37.07,">> You just have to, like, endure about half an hour of..."
47,00:03:39.77,00:03:39.77,">> Itchiness? >> ...itchiness, and then"
48,00:03:41.63,00:03:41.63,it won't itch anymore. >> This is like the
49,00:03:43.17,00:03:43.17,hardest thing I've ever done to not itch right now.
50,00:03:44.77,00:03:44.77,>> Your arms are messed up now. >> I hate everything right now.
51,00:03:48.47,00:03:48.47,"Not you guys, but I want to go home."
52,00:03:50.87,00:03:50.87,">> Oh, God, Jenna. >> Jenna's hurting."
53,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,"Jenna wants to go home. Um, first of all, Jenna's not"
54,00:04:05.27,00:04:05.27,eating. I don't know what that's all
55,00:04:07.47,00:04:07.47,"about. You know, I think that first"
56,00:04:10.67,00:04:10.67,four days where we had no water and no food really put her body
57,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,into a tailspin where she's feeling it today.
58,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,And now she's not even drinking enough.
59,00:04:20.83,00:04:20.83,I have to push her to drink. She won't go in the water to
60,00:04:23.13,00:04:23.13,cool her body down. She's just not taking
61,00:04:25.00,00:04:25.00,directions. She's kind of a wandering
62,00:04:27.23,00:04:27.23,zombie. >> It seems to be tough for
63,00:04:31.07,00:04:31.07,"her this time around. >> Yeah, it's tough."
64,00:04:33.07,00:04:33.07,>> Especially mentally. >> Mm-hmm.
65,00:04:35.30,00:04:35.30,>> I don't think she's happy. >> She's really not.
66,00:04:37.30,00:04:37.30,She's really not happy. >> We're going to dig
67,00:04:52.63,00:04:52.63,some holes and bury these like this and sit that on top.
68,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57,>> I don't know exactly what has got into the tribe.
69,00:05:02.30,00:05:02.30,"This morning, they want to do stuff."
70,00:05:04.70,00:05:04.70,"It's a little bit of missing Rudy, a little bit of guilt, a"
71,00:05:07.73,00:05:07.73,little everything. There's a lot of nervous energy.
72,00:05:09.87,00:05:09.87,It's getting everybody going. >> Without being
73,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,"overconfident or cocky, I'm feeling really good about where"
74,00:05:18.03,00:05:18.03,we're at. Yay!
75,00:05:22.03,00:05:22.03,>> That's cute. >> The four of us left
76,00:05:24.90,00:05:24.90,"in this tribe are family, and we work really well together."
77,00:05:28.27,00:05:28.27,">> Oh, another little one. >> A little guy."
78,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,Better than eating them damn snails.
79,00:05:33.57,00:05:33.57,>> Where'd you find that guy? >> Right there.
80,00:05:37.97,00:05:37.97,">> All right, try this out. ( Rupert chuckling )"
81,00:06:00.07,00:06:00.07,">> As soon as I brought the fish back, Ethan's grabbing"
82,00:06:03.60,00:06:03.60,his spear and running out there. ( chuckles )
83,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,I tried to tell him it's not a competition.
84,00:06:09.90,00:06:09.90,It's really not. >> I hope he catches something.
85,00:06:14.67,00:06:14.67,"That'd be good for his ego. >> I mean, those"
86,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07,triggerfish swim into a nook. You just got to jab them.
87,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00,>> You jab 'em. >> Just couldn't do it.
88,00:06:29.00,00:06:29.00,>> You'll get better. I like being the fisherman.
89,00:06:33.23,00:06:33.23,"I know he wants to be, too, but it can't be a competition"
90,00:06:37.97,00:06:37.97,between he and I. It will just hurt his emotions.
91,00:06:42.00,00:06:42.00,It will hurt the whole camp. That's what beat us at the
92,00:06:44.80,00:06:44.80,challenge yesterday. We weren't working together.
93,00:06:47.70,00:06:47.70,"If we can keep this harmony up, we will be a strong little"
94,00:06:51.43,00:06:51.43,"tribe. Even though we're little, we"
95,00:06:54.33,00:06:54.33,are going to be mighty. >> It was low tide early enough
96,00:07:06.17,00:07:06.17,"in the morning, and I figured, ""Here's my shot."
97,00:07:09.57,00:07:09.57,"I'm going to go get something for breakfast."""
98,00:07:12.63,00:07:12.63,I really want to get one of these rays.
99,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,There are some enormous stingrays out there.
100,00:07:17.67,00:07:17.67,"And I saw a couple, but I couldn't get to 'em in time."
101,00:07:20.60,00:07:20.60,"I have no fins and it's very, very difficult."
102,00:07:23.27,00:07:23.27,Never mind a spear that's as blunt as you can imagine.
103,00:07:25.83,00:07:25.83,But I was determined to get some good food and roast it.
104,00:07:31.63,00:07:31.63,"You bring in a fish, you get some smiles."
105,00:07:40.90,00:07:40.90,"I eventually found a shark under a ledge, and I wanted him."
106,00:07:47.00,00:07:47.00,So I said screw it. Let the spears float.
107,00:07:51.07,00:07:51.07,"Just look at it, just gauge the situation."
108,00:07:53.60,00:07:53.60,"Just kept thinking, ""How am I going to do this?"
109,00:07:56.47,00:07:56.47,"How am I going to do this?"" Screw it."
110,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23,I'm not leaving the thing there. I'm going home with food.
111,00:08:09.30,00:08:09.30,He starts thrashing. Tight up against the rock.
112,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63,As long as he was trying to stay lodged in there and I didn't
113,00:08:16.13,00:08:16.13,"move my hand, but wouldn't let him go, I felt okay."
114,00:08:19.33,00:08:19.33,"Kept breathing. Going up, breathing, holding on,"
115,00:08:21.60,00:08:21.60,breathing. Trying to get enough energy to
116,00:08:24.37,00:08:24.37,think what I'm going to do. So I grabbed my spear and
117,00:08:27.93,00:08:27.93,figured I'd try to get through his belly.
118,00:08:43.63,00:08:43.63,( gasps ) I let the head part go for a
119,00:08:48.93,00:08:48.93,second and whomp-- shark bite! And I poke him in the eye.
120,00:08:53.23,00:08:53.23,He takes another chunk deeper. There was no way.
121,00:08:56.23,00:08:56.23,He was not letting go. He was never letting go.
122,00:08:58.47,00:08:58.47,"I spent the next-- I don't know-- half hour like that,"
123,00:09:02.60,00:09:02.60,trying to figure out what am I going to do to get this thing
124,00:09:04.90,00:09:04.90,"off? So I swim, no fins, nothing,"
125,00:09:06.73,00:09:06.73,just kind of backwards swimming as close as I can to shore to
126,00:09:09.73,00:09:09.73,get onto a rock. Get onto a rock and pound the
127,00:09:14.13,00:09:14.13,side of his head with a rock until he lets go.
128,00:09:18.83,00:09:18.83,"Yi-yi-yi-yi. >> Oh, my God."
129,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,">> His teeth, right there. He's got me."
130,00:09:26.23,00:09:26.23,"Pull it. I let go a little bit, he goes"
131,00:09:28.80,00:09:28.80,"whomp, for the second bite. Bites in further and harder."
132,00:09:32.77,00:09:32.77,So what do I do? I bite him.
133,00:09:34.57,00:09:34.57,">> Oh, my God! Richard! >> Can you see the bite marks?"
134,00:09:37.63,00:09:37.63,>> Is it possible to call a gay man a stud?
135,00:09:41.43,00:09:41.43,"I think you're a stud. >> Yeah, you're a provider."
136,00:09:44.73,00:09:44.73,">> If you're going to stay on my arm, it's like this."
137,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,>> No way anybody else is catching fish like that.
138,00:09:50.63,00:09:50.63,Richard Hatch is a fishing god. He bit a shark that bit him.
139,00:09:56.60,00:09:56.60,"I mean, it's so... It's like man versus nature."
140,00:09:59.43,00:09:59.43,It's so Hemingway-esque. I love it.
141,00:10:01.93,00:10:01.93,>> He's impressive. >> He's very impressive.
142,00:10:04.13,00:10:04.13,"I mean, he may not be impressive downstairs, but he's very"
143,00:10:08.13,00:10:08.13,impressive in other ways. ( Richard chuckling )
144,00:10:20.50,00:10:20.50,">> You know, you're at the point without food for"
145,00:10:22.80,00:10:22.80,"whatever it's been, seven days. People are ready to eat."
146,00:10:25.87,00:10:25.87,I need to be the provider. They are just loving me right
147,00:10:30.03,00:10:30.03,now and it's good. He bit me-- I ate him.
148,00:10:34.73,00:10:34.73,"Mm. >> Oh, mama mia, we-a"
149,00:10:40.37,00:10:40.37,having a-some a-good food. >> I've reached my daily
150,00:10:44.97,00:10:44.97,limit of giving thanks to Richard Hatch.
151,00:10:46.97,00:10:46.97,">> And they go on and on and on: ""Thanks, Richard, thanks,"
152,00:10:48.97,00:10:48.97,"Richard, thanks, Richard."" Little baby bye-byes, Richard,"
153,00:10:53.47,00:10:53.47,real soon. ( laughs )
154,00:11:08.93,00:11:08.93,>> Want to go check tree mail? >> Okay.
155,00:11:11.60,00:11:11.60,">> Wait for me. >> Okay, come on."
156,00:11:16.73,00:11:16.73,">> Oh, my God, you guys. Home Depot box?"
157,00:11:21.70,00:11:21.70,"Okay, ready? Drum roll."
158,00:11:23.30,00:11:23.30,">> Spears. >> Oh, my God!"
159,00:11:30.63,00:11:30.63,">> We got to build... >> Okay, hold on. Hold on."

263,00:16:30.27,00:16:30.27,stand up. That's what I want.

265,00:16:37.30,00:16:37.30,is a good idea. >> Okay.
266,00:16:40.30,00:16:40.30,So you want to build the thing all out of the ground?
267,00:16:43.03,00:16:43.03,"We need... >> Yeah, I think it"
268,00:16:45.40,00:16:45.40,"makes more sense 'cause if we get it moist, kind of"

272,00:16:56.50,00:16:56.50,place I can actually sleep in. Sounds to me like you're
273,00:16:59.33,00:16:59.33,"really concerned about something standing out, and I"
274,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90,"love that, but... >> None of them are"

278,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,>> Rupert's a complete control freak.
279,00:17:14.17,00:17:14.17,He has to have everything his way and he thinks he's the
280,00:17:16.83,00:17:16.83,only one who can do it right. But you know what?
281,00:17:20.30,00:17:20.30,All we need is rain rushing down the side of that hill
282,00:17:22.33,00:17:22.33,right into our shelter and we're screwed.
283,00:17:25.37,00:17:25.37,"The other thing is, it's going to take longer to dig"
284,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,three feet in the ground... >> How do you have any idea?
285,00:17:30.70,00:17:30.70,I know what I can do. I'm 40 years old.

287,00:17:35.33,00:17:35.33,>> I hear you. Can we vote on it?
288,00:17:37.33,00:17:37.33,Does anyone else have any concern?
289,00:17:47.00,00:17:47.00,>> Okay. All right.
290,00:17:49.20,00:17:49.20,>> Then we should... >> Then let's do it.
291,00:17:51.60,00:17:51.60,Let's just... do it. Let's just do it.

293,00:17:57.33,00:17:57.33,Perfect. That's just what I wanted.
294,00:18:00.83,00:18:00.83,"She had very valid points. You know, I don't want to dig"
295,00:18:04.17,00:18:04.17,"down three feet, live under the ground, but I'm not going"
296,00:18:07.20,00:18:07.20,"to say that 'cause if you piss someone off, you know, you"
297,00:18:09.67,00:18:09.67,could be going home. >> We're going to make
298,00:18:14.43,00:18:14.43,the most amazing tree house you've ever seen.
299,00:18:16.00,00:18:16.00,">> That's right. >> As far as the, uh,"

303,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,"doing an elevated floor plan, probably have a little balcony"
304,00:18:32.20,00:18:32.20,"out front, a kitchen area over on the left..."
305,00:18:34.93,00:18:34.93,>> A nap area down below. And perhaps a little crow's

314,00:18:55.07,00:18:55.07,>> TV. >> We're not making a TV.
315,00:18:58.33,00:18:58.33,Um... >> There are six members of our
316,00:19:02.20,00:19:02.20,"tribe 'cause we've never lost anything, yet, so we had to sit"
317,00:19:05.47,00:19:05.47,out two people. And I happily sat out of that
318,00:19:08.43,00:19:08.43,"one, 'cause that's a lot of work."
319,00:19:10.80,00:19:10.80,"So we've got Lex and, uh, Colby building the shelter,"

324,00:19:26.60,00:19:26.60,This is all nonstructural stuff that I thought it would
325,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,"be fun to add. Rope ladder, a hammock, to"

329,00:19:45.00,00:19:45.00,"that would go from the top floor to down, downstairs"

334,00:19:55.33,00:19:55.33,>> The most important thing is the structure itself.
335,00:20:01.33,00:20:01.33,">> It was as if when we spoke, they couldn't hear it."
336,00:20:05.80,00:20:05.80,"They had, like, their transmitters tuned to each"

347,00:20:42.40,00:20:42.40,That's a constant issue with me. I'm wondering if I should have

357,00:21:22.07,00:21:22.07,We ended up working all through the night.
358,00:21:25.07,00:21:25.07,We were trying to nail nails in the pitch black.
359,00:21:30.37,00:21:30.37,"And then in the middle of the night, Rupert had dug half the"

560,00:33:35.00,00:33:35.00,think I need to be with my family.
561,00:33:37.67,00:33:37.67,I think family is the number one thing right now.
562,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,And I think that they need me. And as much as I don't want to
563,00:33:42.47,00:33:42.47,"do it, it's a wise decision for me to walk at this point in"
564,00:33:45.43,00:33:45.43,"time, so... >> God, Jenna."
565,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,>> It frightens me that my mom-- something horrible might happen
566,00:33:52.80,00:33:52.80,"to my mom while I'm here, and it plagues me every day."
567,00:33:55.70,00:33:55.70,It follows me around like a dark cloud.
568,00:33:57.93,00:33:57.93,And I don't think I'd ever forgive myself if I knew that I
569,00:34:01.23,00:34:01.23,was here playing a game and something happened to her.
570,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,">> Kathy, is she all right? >> It's just too much for her."
571,00:34:11.30,00:34:11.30,"Jenna was just a quivering, shaking little leaf."
572,00:34:16.03,00:34:16.03,And she's finally collapsing. Her mom is an a cancer rehab
573,00:34:19.73,00:34:19.73,"home, and I didn't realize that. She shouldn't be here actually,"
574,00:34:22.93,00:34:22.93,in my opinion. She should not be here.
575,00:34:26.63,00:34:26.63,And I just finally heard about it.
576,00:34:28.10,00:34:28.10,"She finally came up to me and told me that, and I said, ""You"
577,00:34:30.00,00:34:30.00,"know what, Jenna, you have every right to be in the doldrums."""
578,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,Every right. >> Life is so short.
579,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,You blink and you're gone. We're a tribe that has not
580,00:34:46.73,00:34:46.73,lost one challenge since this game began.
581,00:34:49.90,00:34:49.90,And the reason for that is because of output by all six
582,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,players. Losing any one of those six
583,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,would be a detriment. It would hurt a lot.
584,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"It would hurt morale, it would hurt our performance."
585,00:35:01.63,00:35:01.63,"You know, I don't even like to think about the possibilities or"
586,00:35:04.60,00:35:04.60,the what-if scenarios if Jenna exits.
587,00:35:08.07,00:35:08.07,">> You're a good person. And you won this sucker, man."
588,00:35:11.30,00:35:11.30,">> It's all good. >> The thing is, you need"
589,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,"to know something, because this is real."
590,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,It's becoming a bit of a cancer eating away at us.
591,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,"And so that's why, if you can just hold that down to help us"
592,00:35:21.33,00:35:21.33,"out, because we need more positive attitudes right now."
593,00:35:24.80,00:35:24.80,>> I completely agree with you. >> We totally know what
594,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,"you're going through, but let's just wait to see what happens."
595,00:35:42.37,00:35:42.37,>> PROBST: Getting your first look at the new Saboga tribe.
596,00:35:45.60,00:35:45.60,Rudy voted out at the last Tribal Council.
597,00:35:47.97,00:35:47.97,">> Oh, my Rudy. >> PROBST: He's gone, Richard."
598,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"First things first. Give it up, Kathy."
599,00:35:55.37,00:35:55.37,"Mariano. Once again, immunity back up for"
600,00:36:00.80,00:36:00.80,grabs. So nine days in.
601,00:36:04.50,00:36:04.50,Starting to get into it now. You guys have a lot of bug
602,00:36:06.80,00:36:06.80,"bites. How are you holding up, Jenna?"
603,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,>> Bitten. That's about the worst of it.
604,00:36:10.43,00:36:10.43,">> PROBST: Emotionally though, all right?"
605,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,">> Oh yeah, emotionally we feel pretty good."
606,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60,"Plenty of water, plenty of food. Shelter's working out pretty"
607,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,"good. >> PROBST: How about you,"
608,00:36:17.70,00:36:17.70,"Chapera? Amber, how you doing?"
609,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,">> The bugs like me, but it's all right."
610,00:36:21.53,00:36:21.53,>> PROBST: What's going on with Mogo Mogo?
611,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,>> We got a couple of issues. A couple of emotional things
612,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,going on. >> PROBST: What's going on?
613,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,>> Okay. ( crying )
614,00:36:31.23,00:36:31.23,Wait. Due to...
615,00:36:33.57,00:36:33.57,someone who's very ill at home right now that's getting
616,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"worse, I need to pull myself out of the game and be there."
617,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,"I love this game so much, but my priority is my family..."
618,00:36:57.83,00:36:57.83,and it just doesn't make any sense for me to be here anymore.
619,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,So I need to take myself out of the game.
620,00:37:05.23,00:37:05.23,">> PROBST: So, are you talking about your mom?"
621,00:37:08.23,00:37:08.23,>> Yeah. Yeah. She's just not any better and...
622,00:37:11.97,00:37:11.97,things have gotten a little worse... quickly.
623,00:37:16.20,00:37:16.20,>> PROBST: You're talking as though you're getting
624,00:37:18.37,00:37:18.37,"information, updates on your mom, in the last nine days."
625,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,">> No, it's just she's my mother and I'm the only child."
626,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,I got a vibe. I got a feeling that she needs
627,00:37:25.80,00:37:25.80,me there. My dad needs me there.
628,00:37:28.27,00:37:28.27,Everybody needs me there. I made a bad judgment call.
629,00:37:32.07,00:37:32.07,I shouldn't have came. I thought that I could do it
630,00:37:35.13,00:37:35.13,"and she would want me to and I, I was wrong."
631,00:37:38.63,00:37:38.63,I should be there in case something happens.
632,00:37:41.37,00:37:41.37,I'll never forgive myself. You got to weigh out your
633,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"options. I love this game, but it's, it's"
634,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,"my family. >> PROBST: Alicia, what are you"
635,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,thinking? >> I think family's the
636,00:37:49.37,00:37:49.37,most important thing in the world.
637,00:37:50.87,00:37:50.87,There's nothing you can ever put above family.
638,00:37:52.97,00:37:52.97,I wouldn't have come out here to begin with.
639,00:37:54.53,00:37:54.53,"No matter whether my mother said, ""I want you to go,"" I"
640,00:37:57.97,00:37:57.97,"would have never came, ever. >> Jenna admits her mistake."
641,00:38:00.97,00:38:00.97,Everybody makes it. She admits her mistake.
642,00:38:02.57,00:38:02.57,">> But I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have come."
643,00:38:04.63,00:38:04.63,">> PROBST: How about you, Amber? >> ( crying )"
644,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,I feel really bad for her. Can I give her a hug?
645,00:38:11.43,00:38:11.43,>> PROBST: Of course. >> Thank you.
646,00:38:15.23,00:38:15.23,>> I hope it works out. >> This is the last thing
647,00:38:17.93,00:38:17.93,I wanted to do. It really is.
648,00:38:19.43,00:38:19.43,"I really wanted to play this game, and I give all these"
649,00:38:22.47,00:38:22.47,"people more credit than ever, 'cause it's hard."
650,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,>> PROBST: So that's one of my questions.
651,00:38:27.03,00:38:27.03,I just want to understand exactly why you're leaving.
652,00:38:29.70,00:38:29.70,If you're leaving 'cause you can't handle it...
653,00:38:31.80,00:38:31.80,>> No. I can handle it. I handled it last time.
654,00:38:34.93,00:38:34.93,This is time I need with my mother.
655,00:38:36.97,00:38:36.97,"I need to be there sitting by her bed, whether she's awake"
656,00:38:40.03,00:38:40.03,or not. I need to know that I had this
657,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,time with her while I could. >> PROBST: Boston Rob.
658,00:38:46.80,00:38:46.80,">> Well, I don't think it's right to even question her"
659,00:38:49.93,00:38:49.93,motives. We don't know what she's
660,00:38:51.57,00:38:51.57,"thinking or how she's feeling. I'm not one to get emotional,"
661,00:38:55.30,00:38:55.30,"and I know inside right now, I feel butterflies."
662,00:38:58.83,00:38:58.83,So I say we just support her decision and go from here.
663,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,">> PROBST: Rupert. >> I feel bad for her,"
664,00:39:08.77,00:39:08.77,"but, you know... to quit-- it's hard."
665,00:39:13.47,00:39:13.47,"It's a hard decision. >> Before I left, I told my"
666,00:39:18.43,00:39:18.43,"family, I made a commitment, I was coming here, not staying"
667,00:39:22.13,00:39:22.13,home. If y'all got killed in a car
668,00:39:25.10,00:39:25.10,"wreck, don't call me. I'll be there after it's over,"
669,00:39:28.93,00:39:28.93,"but, now, I made that decision for Big Tom."
670,00:39:32.07,00:39:32.07,And a lot of people are different than Big Tom.
671,00:39:34.90,00:39:34.90,">> PROBST: You know, we all have different values we place on"
672,00:39:37.77,00:39:37.77,"different things. And I, I don't get the sense"
673,00:39:40.27,00:39:40.27,"that anybody here is saying, ""I'm right, she's wrong."""
674,00:39:43.37,00:39:43.37,"But you guys are being pretty honest in saying, ""Here's what I"
675,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"would have done."" This is a big action with big"
676,00:39:48.80,00:39:48.80,consequences. And it could have a big impact
677,00:39:51.53,00:39:51.53,on this game. We had an immunity challenge
678,00:39:54.07,00:39:54.07,"that we don't need to run now. Chapera, Saboga, you get off"
679,00:39:57.30,00:39:57.30,"easy, in a sense. You get a free pass today."
680,00:39:59.53,00:39:59.53,Nothing at stake. You're going back to camp.
681,00:40:02.53,00:40:02.53,"Mogo Mogo, from a game point of view, it hurts you."
682,00:40:05.53,00:40:05.53,This is a game about numbers. You only have six to begin with.
683,00:40:08.70,00:40:08.70,You are now down to five. That increases your chances of
684,00:40:11.50,00:40:11.50,being voted out at the next Tribal Council.
685,00:40:13.70,00:40:13.70,We won't run the immunity challenge.
686,00:40:16.27,00:40:16.27,"We won't have an official Tribal Council, but we do have the"
687,00:40:20.63,00:40:20.63,formality of you going home. Can you make it to Tribal
688,00:40:23.93,00:40:23.93,Council? >> No.
689,00:40:24.77,00:40:24.77,I can't. I'm sorry.
690,00:40:27.90,00:40:27.90,I've pushed too far. I don't think I can do it.
691,00:40:32.57,00:40:32.57,>> PROBST: Fair enough. Let's bring in a boat.
692,00:40:48.03,00:40:48.03,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
693,00:41:25.70,00:41:25.70,Jenna. We're thinking about you.
694,00:41:27.70,00:41:27.70,">> Thanks. Bye, guys. Have fun."
695,00:41:51.03,00:41:51.03,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
696,00:42:33.63,00:42:33.63,>> ANNOUNCER: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
697,00:42:39.63,00:42:39.63,"Next time on Survivor, Rob and Amber heat things up."
698,00:42:43.47,00:42:43.47,>> You're so warm. >> Boston Rob and Amber
699,00:42:46.63,00:42:46.63,are gonna do it. >> ANNOUNCER: A storm wreaks
700,00:42:49.43,00:42:49.43,havoc. >> It's not worth it.
701,00:42:52.30,00:42:52.30,>> ANNOUNCER: And a challenge gets physical.
702,00:42:54.43,00:42:54.43,>> PROBST: Ethan throws it on Colby.
703,00:42:56.57,00:42:56.57,>> Damn it! >> When Jenna announced
704,00:43:05.60,00:43:05.60,"that she was going home, there was this mood that swung through"
705,00:43:09.03,00:43:09.03,everybody and everybody's shoulders went down and their
706,00:43:12.03,00:43:12.03,head hung low and it all brought back the reality that it's
707,00:43:15.27,00:43:15.27,"difficult out here, and even though it's a game, there's a"
708,00:43:18.43,00:43:18.43,whole lot more happening here. Captioning sponsored by CBS
