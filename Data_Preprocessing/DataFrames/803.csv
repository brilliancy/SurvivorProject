32,00:03:01.33,00:03:01.33,and now I'm definitely payingfor it because I think that

82,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,I tried to tell him it's not acompetition.
83,00:06:09.90,00:06:09.90,It's really not.>> I hope he catches something.
84,00:06:14.67,00:06:14.67,"That'd be good for his ego.>> I mean, those"
85,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07,triggerfish swim into a nook.You just got to jab them.
86,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00,>> You jab 'em.>> Just couldn't do it.
87,00:06:29.00,00:06:29.00,>> You'll get better.I like being the fisherman.
88,00:06:33.23,00:06:33.23,"I know he wants to be, too, butit can't be a competition"
89,00:06:37.97,00:06:37.97,between he and I.It will just hurt his emotions.
90,00:06:42.00,00:06:42.00,It will hurt the whole camp.That's what beat us at the
91,00:06:44.80,00:06:44.80,challenge yesterday.We weren't working together.
92,00:06:47.70,00:06:47.70,"If we can keep this harmony up,we will be a strong little"
93,00:06:51.43,00:06:51.43,"tribe.Even though we're little, we"
94,00:06:54.33,00:06:54.33,are going to be mighty.>> It was low tide early enough
95,00:07:06.17,00:07:06.17,"in the morning, and I figured,""Here's my shot."
96,00:07:09.57,00:07:09.57,"I'm going to go get somethingfor breakfast."""
97,00:07:12.63,00:07:12.63,I really want to get one ofthese rays.
98,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,There are some enormousstingrays out there.
99,00:07:17.67,00:07:17.67,"And I saw a couple, but Icouldn't get to 'em in time."
100,00:07:20.60,00:07:20.60,"I have no fins and it's very,very difficult."
101,00:07:23.27,00:07:23.27,Never mind a spear that's asblunt as you can imagine.
102,00:07:25.83,00:07:25.83,But I was determined to get somegood food and roast it.
103,00:07:31.63,00:07:31.63,"You bring in a fish, you getsome smiles."
104,00:07:40.90,00:07:40.90,"I eventually found a shark undera ledge, and I wanted him."
105,00:07:47.00,00:07:47.00,So I said screw it.Let the spears float.
106,00:07:51.07,00:07:51.07,"Just look at it, just gauge thesituation."
107,00:07:53.60,00:07:53.60,"Just kept thinking, ""How am Igoing to do this?"
108,00:07:56.47,00:07:56.47,"How am I going to do this?""Screw it."
109,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23,I'm not leaving the thing there.I'm going home with food.
110,00:08:09.30,00:08:09.30,He starts thrashing.Tight up against the rock.
111,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63,As long as he was trying to staylodged in there and I didn't
112,00:08:16.13,00:08:16.13,"move my hand, but wouldn't lethim go, I felt okay."
113,00:08:19.33,00:08:19.33,"Kept breathing.Going up, breathing, holding on,"
114,00:08:21.60,00:08:21.60,breathing.Trying to get enough energy to
115,00:08:24.37,00:08:24.37,think what I'm going to do.So I grabbed my spear and
116,00:08:27.93,00:08:27.93,figured I'd try to get throughhis belly.
117,00:08:43.63,00:08:43.63,( gasps )I let the head part go for a
118,00:08:48.93,00:08:48.93,second and whomp-- shark bite!And I poke him in the eye.
119,00:08:53.23,00:08:53.23,He takes another chunk deeper.There was no way.
120,00:08:56.23,00:08:56.23,He was not letting go.He was never letting go.
121,00:08:58.47,00:08:58.47,"I spent the next-- I don'tknow-- half hour like that,"
122,00:09:02.60,00:09:02.60,trying to figure out what am Igoing to do to get this thing
123,00:09:04.90,00:09:04.90,"off?So I swim, no fins, nothing,"
124,00:09:06.73,00:09:06.73,just kind of backwards swimmingas close as I can to shore to
125,00:09:09.73,00:09:09.73,get onto a rock.Get onto a rock and pound the
126,00:09:14.13,00:09:14.13,side of his head with a rockuntil he lets go.
127,00:09:18.83,00:09:18.83,"Yi-yi-yi-yi.>> Oh, my God."
128,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,">> His teeth, right there.He's got me."
129,00:09:26.23,00:09:26.23,"Pull it.I let go a little bit, he goes"
130,00:09:28.80,00:09:28.80,"whomp, for the second bite.Bites in further and harder."
131,00:09:32.77,00:09:32.77,So what do I do?I bite him.
132,00:09:34.57,00:09:34.57,">> Oh, my God! Richard!>> Can you see the bite marks?"
133,00:09:37.63,00:09:37.63,>> Is it possible to calla gay man a stud?

135,00:09:44.73,00:09:44.73,">> If you're going tostay on my arm, it's like this."
136,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,>> No way anybody elseis catching fish like that.

561,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,And I think that they need me.And as much as I don't want to
562,00:33:42.47,00:33:42.47,"do it, it's a wise decision forme to walk at this point in"
563,00:33:45.43,00:33:45.43,"time, so...>> God, Jenna."
564,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,>> It frightens me that my mom--something horrible might happen
565,00:33:52.80,00:33:52.80,"to my mom while I'm here, and itplagues me every day."
566,00:33:55.70,00:33:55.70,It follows me around like a darkcloud.
567,00:33:57.93,00:33:57.93,And I don't think I'd everforgive myself if I knew that I
568,00:34:01.23,00:34:01.23,was here playing a game andsomething happened to her.
569,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,">> Kathy, is she all right?>> It's just too much for her."
570,00:34:11.30,00:34:11.30,"Jenna was just a quivering,shaking little leaf."
571,00:34:16.03,00:34:16.03,And she's finally collapsing.Her mom is an a cancer rehab
572,00:34:19.73,00:34:19.73,"home, and I didn't realize that.She shouldn't be here actually,"
573,00:34:22.93,00:34:22.93,in my opinion.She should not be here.
574,00:34:26.63,00:34:26.63,And I just finally heard aboutit.
575,00:34:28.10,00:34:28.10,"She finally came up to me andtold me that, and I said, ""You"
576,00:34:30.00,00:34:30.00,"know what, Jenna, you have everyright to be in the doldrums."""
577,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,Every right.>> Life is so short.
578,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,You blink and you're gone.We're a tribe that has not
579,00:34:46.73,00:34:46.73,lost one challenge sincethis game began.
580,00:34:49.90,00:34:49.90,And the reason for that isbecause of output by all six
581,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,players.Losing any one of those six
582,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,would be a detriment.It would hurt a lot.
583,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"It would hurt morale, it wouldhurt our performance."
584,00:35:01.63,00:35:01.63,"You know, I don't even like tothink about the possibilities or"
585,00:35:04.60,00:35:04.60,the what-if scenarios if Jennaexits.
586,00:35:08.07,00:35:08.07,">> You're a good person.And you won this sucker, man."
587,00:35:11.30,00:35:11.30,">> It's all good.>> The thing is, you need"
588,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,"to know something, because thisis real."
589,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,It's becoming a bit of a cancereating away at us.
590,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,"And so that's why, if you canjust hold that down to help us"
591,00:35:21.33,00:35:21.33,"out, because we need morepositive attitudes right now."
592,00:35:24.80,00:35:24.80,>> I completely agree with you.>> We totally know what
593,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,"you're going through, but let'sjust wait to see what happens."
594,00:35:42.37,00:35:42.37,>> PROBST: Getting your firstlook at the new Saboga tribe.
595,00:35:45.60,00:35:45.60,Rudy voted out at the lastTribal Council.
596,00:35:47.97,00:35:47.97,">> Oh, my Rudy.>> PROBST: He's gone, Richard."
597,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"First things first.Give it up, Kathy."
598,00:35:55.37,00:35:55.37,"Mariano.Once again, immunity back up for"
599,00:36:00.80,00:36:00.80,grabs.So nine days in.
600,00:36:04.50,00:36:04.50,Starting to get into it now.You guys have a lot of bug
601,00:36:06.80,00:36:06.80,"bites.How are you holding up, Jenna?"
602,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,>> Bitten.That's about the worst of it.
603,00:36:10.43,00:36:10.43,">> PROBST: Emotionally though,all right?"
604,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,">> Oh yeah,emotionally we feel pretty good."
605,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60,"Plenty of water, plenty of food.Shelter's working out pretty"
606,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,"good.>> PROBST: How about you,"
607,00:36:17.70,00:36:17.70,"Chapera?Amber, how you doing?"
608,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,">> The bugs like me,but it's all right."
609,00:36:21.53,00:36:21.53,>> PROBST: What's going on withMogo Mogo?
610,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,>> We got a couple of issues.A couple of emotional things
611,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,going on.>> PROBST: What's going on?
612,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,>> Okay.( crying )
613,00:36:31.23,00:36:31.23,Wait.Due to...
614,00:36:33.57,00:36:33.57,someone who's very illat home right now that's getting
615,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"worse, I need to pull myself outof the game and be there."
616,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,"I love this game so much, but mypriority is my family..."
617,00:36:57.83,00:36:57.83,and it just doesn't make anysense for me to be here anymore.
618,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,So I need to take myself out ofthe game.
619,00:37:05.23,00:37:05.23,">> PROBST: So, are you talkingabout your mom?"
620,00:37:08.23,00:37:08.23,>> Yeah. Yeah.She's just not any better and...
621,00:37:11.97,00:37:11.97,things have gotten a littleworse... quickly.
622,00:37:16.20,00:37:16.20,>> PROBST: You're talking asthough you're getting
623,00:37:18.37,00:37:18.37,"information, updates on yourmom, in the last nine days."
624,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,">> No, it's just she's mymother and I'm the only child."
625,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,I got a vibe.I got a feeling that she needs
626,00:37:25.80,00:37:25.80,me there.My dad needs me there.
627,00:37:28.27,00:37:28.27,Everybody needs me there.I made a bad judgment call.
628,00:37:32.07,00:37:32.07,I shouldn't have came.I thought that I could do it
629,00:37:35.13,00:37:35.13,"and she would want me to and I,I was wrong."
630,00:37:38.63,00:37:38.63,I should be there in casesomething happens.
631,00:37:41.37,00:37:41.37,I'll never forgive myself.You got to weigh out your
632,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"options.I love this game, but it's, it's"
633,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,"my family.>> PROBST: Alicia, what are you"
634,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,thinking?>> I think family's the
635,00:37:49.37,00:37:49.37,most important thing in theworld.
636,00:37:50.87,00:37:50.87,There's nothing you can ever putabove family.
637,00:37:52.97,00:37:52.97,I wouldn't have come out here tobegin with.
638,00:37:54.53,00:37:54.53,"No matter whether my mothersaid, ""I want you to go,"" I"
639,00:37:57.97,00:37:57.97,"would have never came, ever.>> Jenna admits her mistake."
640,00:38:00.97,00:38:00.97,Everybody makes it.She admits her mistake.
641,00:38:02.57,00:38:02.57,">> But I wouldn't have,I wouldn't have come."
642,00:38:04.63,00:38:04.63,">> PROBST: How about you, Amber?>> ( crying )"
643,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,I feel really bad for her.Can I give her a hug?
644,00:38:11.43,00:38:11.43,>> PROBST: Of course.>> Thank you.
645,00:38:15.23,00:38:15.23,>> I hope it works out.>> This is the last thing
646,00:38:17.93,00:38:17.93,I wanted to do.It really is.
647,00:38:19.43,00:38:19.43,"I really wanted to play thisgame, and I give all these"
648,00:38:22.47,00:38:22.47,"people more credit than ever,'cause it's hard."
649,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,>> PROBST: So that's one of myquestions.
650,00:38:27.03,00:38:27.03,I just want to understandexactly why you're leaving.
651,00:38:29.70,00:38:29.70,If you're leaving 'cause youcan't handle it...
652,00:38:31.80,00:38:31.80,>> No. I can handle it.I handled it last time.
653,00:38:34.93,00:38:34.93,This is time I need with mymother.
654,00:38:36.97,00:38:36.97,"I need to be there sittingby her bed, whether she's awake"
655,00:38:40.03,00:38:40.03,or not.I need to know that I had this
656,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,time with her while I could.>> PROBST: Boston Rob.
657,00:38:46.80,00:38:46.80,">> Well, I don't thinkit's right to even question her"
658,00:38:49.93,00:38:49.93,motives.We don't know what she's
659,00:38:51.57,00:38:51.57,"thinking or how she's feeling.I'm not one to get emotional,"
660,00:38:55.30,00:38:55.30,"and I know inside right now, Ifeel butterflies."
661,00:38:58.83,00:38:58.83,So I say we just support herdecision and go from here.
662,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,">> PROBST: Rupert.>> I feel bad for her,"
663,00:39:08.77,00:39:08.77,"but, you know...to quit-- it's hard."
664,00:39:13.47,00:39:13.47,"It's a hard decision.>> Before I left, I told my"
665,00:39:18.43,00:39:18.43,"family, I made a commitment,I was coming here, not staying"
666,00:39:22.13,00:39:22.13,home.If y'all got killed in a car
667,00:39:25.10,00:39:25.10,"wreck, don't call me.I'll be there after it's over,"
668,00:39:28.93,00:39:28.93,"but, now, I made that decisionfor Big Tom."
669,00:39:32.07,00:39:32.07,And a lot of people aredifferent than Big Tom.
670,00:39:34.90,00:39:34.90,">> PROBST: You know, we all havedifferent values we place on"
671,00:39:37.77,00:39:37.77,"different things.And I, I don't get the sense"
672,00:39:40.27,00:39:40.27,"that anybody here is saying,""I'm right, she's wrong."""
673,00:39:43.37,00:39:43.37,"But you guys are being prettyhonest in saying, ""Here's what I"
674,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"would have done.""This is a big action with big"
675,00:39:48.80,00:39:48.80,consequences.And it could have a big impact
676,00:39:51.53,00:39:51.53,on this game.We had an immunity challenge
677,00:39:54.07,00:39:54.07,"that we don't need to run now.Chapera, Saboga, you get off"
678,00:39:57.30,00:39:57.30,"easy, in a sense.You get a free pass today."
679,00:39:59.53,00:39:59.53,Nothing at stake.You're going back to camp.
680,00:40:02.53,00:40:02.53,"Mogo Mogo, from a game point ofview, it hurts you."
681,00:40:05.53,00:40:05.53,This is a game about numbers.You only have six to begin with.
682,00:40:08.70,00:40:08.70,You are now down to five.That increases your chances of
683,00:40:11.50,00:40:11.50,being voted out at the nextTribal Council.
684,00:40:13.70,00:40:13.70,We won't run the immunitychallenge.
