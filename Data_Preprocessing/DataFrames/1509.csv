265,00:16:35.08,00:16:35.08,"Them little pretty boys and thelittle annoying little girl,"
266,00:16:38.88,00:16:38.88,they are still enemies.They're still trying to
267,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,infiltrate the force to getwhere we already have
268,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,predestined ourselves to be.Amanda is going to be all right.
269,00:16:47.42,00:16:47.42,"Courtney, she's flaky, but she'sgoing to fall in line."
270,00:16:50.42,00:16:50.42,Her... hopefully her and what'shis name don't have a big
271,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,"romance tonight, which mighthappen."
272,00:16:56.21,00:16:56.21,That would hurt.It makes no sense for us to mess
273,00:16:59.08,00:16:59.08,"it up now, but it's so humannature."
274,00:17:01.42,00:17:01.42,"I mean, it's right there infront of you."

277,00:17:10.00,00:17:10.00,>> Uh-huh.>> Because Courtney would do
278,00:17:12.25,00:17:12.25,that for love.>> This is probably the worst
279,00:17:15.25,00:17:15.25,day that I can have out here.People are freaking out around
280,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,"camp, and the four people I getalong best with are out having a"
281,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,good time on a boat somewhere.Today sucks.

287,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,The reward was for this cruiseon the Lee River.
288,00:17:54.50,00:17:54.50,It was spectacular.I felt like it was a pretty cool
289,00:18:02.21,00:18:02.21,"group of people, and you know,of course it was a good"
290,00:18:04.62,00:18:04.62,opportunity to just get to knowthem a little better and try
291,00:18:07.75,00:18:07.75,"and, you know, developrelationships."
292,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,I'm just wondering what it'slike back at camp.

300,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,"I think she feels like she'spowerless, but, like, she's made"
301,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83,"a series of poor decisions.>> As much as I'm, like, still"
302,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"basically on Peih-Gee's side, Idon't mind her being talked"
303,00:18:33.25,00:18:33.25,about negatively simply becauseit means if she's getting talked
304,00:18:36.04,00:18:36.04,"about, then I'm not.>> Here's to us."
305,00:18:39.04,00:18:39.04,>> Yeah.>> Because we're still here.

315,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,And he's kind of cute.He just wants to play.

474,00:30:05.12,00:30:05.12,"Denise, Courtney, and James, oneof the seven you are going home"
475,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,tonight.See you at tribal.
476,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,Head on back.>> How much did you guys eat?
477,00:30:28.46,00:30:28.46,>> I had two burgers and a tonof fries and two things of cola.
478,00:30:31.92,00:30:31.92,And I hated myself for that.>> It's hard to know that I took
479,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,"a risk, made a sacrifice, andnothing really came out of it."
480,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,"I am upset that James, Denise,Todd, and Courtney sat out."
481,00:30:45.46,00:30:45.46,"Like, we're here for 12 moredays."
482,00:30:47.38,00:30:47.38,You can't wait 12 days for acheeseburger?
483,00:30:52.50,00:30:52.50,">> Frosti, you fought hard.I did terrible."
484,00:30:57.29,00:30:57.29,>> Not winning immunity todayand having Peih-Gee win means
485,00:31:00.50,00:31:00.50,that we can't vote her out.So I think Erik kind of already
486,00:31:03.79,00:31:03.79,knows that he's on the choppingblock.
487,00:31:06.25,00:31:06.25,">> Well, if I go tonight, goodluck to you."
488,00:31:09.79,00:31:09.79,">> If I go tonight, good luck toyou."
489,00:31:13.29,00:31:13.29,And we still didn't getcheeseburgers.
490,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,">> Since Peih-Gee won immunity,that means Frosti and I are kind"
491,00:31:19.04,00:31:19.04,"of the obvious ones to go, youknow, probably going to be one"
492,00:31:22.42,00:31:22.42,"of us.And Frosti, I feel like he's..."
493,00:31:26.79,00:31:26.79,"somehow, you know, he's workedhis way... I think he's in good"
494,00:31:29.25,00:31:29.25,with Todd and Amanda andCourtney.
495,00:31:32.21,00:31:32.21,So it definitely makes it seemlike Frosti might be higher up
496,00:31:34.92,00:31:34.92,"the ladder than he once was.But then again, you know, I'm"
497,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,tight with that group now.So maybe that puts me up the
498,00:31:40.83,00:31:40.83,ladder as well.So we'll see.
499,00:31:49.00,00:31:49.00,">> We have to be careful withErik, because he's not like"
500,00:31:51.38,00:31:51.38,Peih-Gee.He's not overbearing.
501,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,He's not abrasive.But he's really good at
502,00:31:56.33,00:31:56.33,making... especially the girls.>> He's smooth.
503,00:32:00.29,00:32:00.29,>> They love him.>> And he plays up the good old
504,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,"country boy from Tennessee.>> I mean, he's a great guy."
505,00:32:09.04,00:32:09.04,"And, like, he's awesome to havearound, but just got to be"
506,00:32:12.25,00:32:12.25,"careful.>> It's like, ""Here you go, have"
507,00:32:14.12,00:32:14.12,"a million dollars, Erik.""Tonight's vote's killer."
508,00:32:19.12,00:32:19.12,"I mean, Erik, if he makes it tothe end, hands down, he's"
509,00:32:23.21,00:32:23.21,guaranteed a million dollars.But Frosti's a big threat.
510,00:32:28.92,00:32:28.92,"You watch him perform in any ofthe challenges, and he is great,"
511,00:32:31.50,00:32:31.50,you know.And that kind of worries me.
512,00:32:34.08,00:32:34.08,So I don't know what I'm goingto do.
513,00:32:35.75,00:32:35.75,It's a toss-up.Frosti and Erik?
514,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,>> One of them guys is leaving.>> Has to go.
515,00:32:41.58,00:32:41.58,We have to get rid of one ofthose two.
516,00:32:44.00,00:32:44.00,"I mean, I love Frosti.I'll write his name down."
517,00:32:46.88,00:32:46.88,Courtney is really tight withhim.
518,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,"If we have to, we pull her in toget rid of Frosti."
519,00:32:51.38,00:32:51.38,She'll vote for Frosti.>> I'm not sure you want to
520,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"trust her, though.I mean, she thinks her Frosti's"
521,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,with her.>> Courtney...
522,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,>> We can convince Courtney.>> You sure?
523,00:33:01.54,00:33:01.54,She's loving the hell out ofFrosti.
524,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,">> If she can't realize that, ifshe really can't realize that,"
525,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,maybe we should turn it aroundand get rid of her.
526,00:33:09.71,00:33:09.71,">> The last tribal council wewent to, I thought everybody was"
527,00:33:12.29,00:33:12.29,voting for Peih-Gee.It turned out everybody was
528,00:33:14.25,00:33:14.25,voting for JR.Tonight I really don't feel
529,00:33:17.42,00:33:17.42,"paranoid, because at least Ithink I know who everybody's"
530,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,voting for.It's either going to be Frosti
531,00:33:22.33,00:33:22.33,or it's going to be Courtneythat goes tonight.
532,00:33:30.62,00:33:30.62,">> Obviously, and it sucks, butwhat are we at, eight?"
533,00:33:32.79,00:33:32.79,Get rid of Erik or Frosti.>> So Erik or Frosti.
534,00:33:36.62,00:33:36.62,">> Has to, right?James and Denise are scared to"
535,00:33:40.04,00:33:40.04,death that you would not bewilling to vote against Frosti.
536,00:33:43.04,00:33:43.04,">> Oh, really?>> Yeah."
537,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,Yes.And would you?
538,00:33:48.25,00:33:48.25,">> Frosti is kind of like mylittle Munchkin, and you know,"
539,00:33:50.42,00:33:50.42,"everyone's kind of worried aboutme because they know that he's,"
540,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,"you know, like, my good friend.>> You've seen him compete."
541,00:33:56.96,00:33:56.96,"I love the kid, but we don'thave a choice, right?"
542,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,">> We'll see how it goes.It really does, like,"
543,00:34:04.04,00:34:04.04,"strategically make a differencewhether or not, you know, I go"
544,00:34:06.83,00:34:06.83,with the group on this one or Idon't go with the group on this
545,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,one.So I don't know.
546,00:34:10.21,00:34:10.21,"I mean, honestly, I don't knowwho I'll vote for."
547,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,>> James and Denise were veryworried about Courtney and her
548,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,friendship with Frosti.I'm worried.
549,00:34:20.62,00:34:20.62,"I mean, we just don't know whatto expect."
550,00:34:23.00,00:34:23.00,She could literally take a sharpturn right at any moment.
551,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,"You know, I may have to vote forher."
552,00:34:55.38,00:34:55.38,">> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of our jury, Jaime"
553,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,"and Jean-Robert, voted out atthe last tribal council."
554,00:35:08.58,00:35:08.58,Let's talk about today'simmunity challenge.
