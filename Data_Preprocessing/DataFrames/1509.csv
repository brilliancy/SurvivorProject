2,00:00:02.29,00:00:02.29,Survivor... Drop your buffs.
3,00:00:03.92,00:00:03.92,...after the two tribes merged...
4,00:00:05.42,00:00:05.42,">> One big, happy family. >> PROBST: ...James had the only"
5,00:00:07.58,00:00:07.58,"two hidden immunity idols. >> James, he's almost guaranteed"
6,00:00:10.96,00:00:10.96,himself in the top five right now.
7,00:00:12.92,00:00:12.92,>> That's funny. I'm on Survivor with two idols.
8,00:00:16.21,00:00:16.21,>> PROBST: And the members of the former Zhan Hu Tribe were on
9,00:00:19.21,00:00:19.21,the chopping block. >> The plan was to get rid of
10,00:00:21.46,00:00:21.46,"Peih-Gee, then Erik and Frosti after that."
11,00:00:25.29,00:00:25.29,">> PROBST: At the reward challenge, there was a school-"
12,00:00:27.21,00:00:27.21,yard pick where everyone was chosen to compete except Denise.
13,00:00:31.08,00:00:31.08,>> We're going to go with Courtney because she's light.
14,00:00:34.50,00:00:34.50,>> PROBST: You will not participate in this challenge.
15,00:00:36.42,00:00:36.42,You'll not be eligible for the reward.
16,00:00:38.33,00:00:38.33,"Take a spot on the bench. And back at camp, she was"
17,00:00:41.33,00:00:41.33,feeling left out. >> Are they going to do that
18,00:00:43.42,00:00:43.42,when it comes down to the final seven?
19,00:00:45.08,00:00:45.08,Am I going to be the one that's going to go home before JR?
20,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,And I going to be the one that goes home before James?
21,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83,I don't want to be that person. >> PROBST: And Courtney's
22,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,allegiance to the Fei Long alliance was also wavering.
23,00:00:55.33,00:00:55.33,">> You got to watch Courtney, because she is a loose cannon."
24,00:00:57.46,00:00:57.46,She does stray off and fall in love with anybody that floats
25,00:01:00.50,00:01:00.50,and smiles at her. >> PROBST: So Peih-Gee jumped at
26,00:01:04.25,00:01:04.25,the small opening by trying to lure Denise and Courtney into
27,00:01:07.17,00:01:07.17,her alliance. >> There's five of us here.
28,00:01:10.17,00:01:10.17,"If we all band together, it'll be four to five; we can pick"
29,00:01:13.71,00:01:13.71,them off one by one. >> PROBST: At the immunity
30,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,"challenge, Courtney was the last one sitting."
31,00:01:20.12,00:01:20.12,"Courtney wins immunity! Facing tribal council, Jean-"
32,00:01:24.00,00:01:24.00,Robert discovered that James had both idols.
33,00:01:27.67,00:01:27.67,>> This is the guy who's favored to win every challenge from here
34,00:01:29.33,00:01:29.33,out. >> PROBST: So he came up with a
35,00:01:32.17,00:01:32.17,plan to take out his closest ally.
36,00:01:34.92,00:01:34.92,">> We could blindside him tonight, because he will not"
37,00:01:37.08,00:01:37.08,pull out the idol tonight. >> PROBST: But Todd turned the
38,00:01:39.38,00:01:39.38,tables on Jean-Robert. >> I think our best bet is Jean-
39,00:01:42.42,00:01:42.42,"Robert. >> Yeah, I don't want... I don't"
40,00:01:44.17,00:01:44.17,like breaking the system. >> You don't want to tell Denise
41,00:01:45.58,00:01:45.58,"or no? >> No, hell no."
42,00:01:48.33,00:01:48.33,">> PROBST: At tribal council, James took the risk of not using"
43,00:01:51.42,00:01:51.42,his idol... James.
44,00:01:53.75,00:01:53.75,...and almost paid the price. He received three votes and
45,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,Peih-Gee received one. One vote left.
46,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,"But in the end, Jean-Robert was dealt a losing hand."
47,00:02:05.21,00:02:05.21,"Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken."
48,00:02:08.88,00:02:08.88,Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
49,00:02:28.67,00:02:28.67,>> I had a narrow escape last night.
50,00:02:31.04,00:02:31.04,"I had three votes. I mean, now all I have to do is"
51,00:02:33.25,00:02:33.25,"stay on my Ps and Qs. But, you know, the odds of me"
52,00:02:36.08,00:02:36.08,actually being kicked off with the two idols are not that hot.
53,00:02:39.04,00:02:39.04,"So from now on, I'll have them with me on tribal council."
54,00:02:48.21,00:02:48.21,( clearing throat ) \xe2\x99\xaa Good morning
55,00:02:52.62,00:02:52.62,good morning! \xe2\x99\xaa I come to say good morning
56,00:02:55.75,00:02:55.75,good morning \xe2\x99\xaa Good morning to you! \xe2\x99\xaa
57,00:02:59.54,00:02:59.54,">> Good morning. >> That was beautiful, by the"
58,00:03:04.71,00:03:04.71,"way. >> Everyone, it's Christmas!"
59,00:03:07.29,00:03:07.29,There's no Jean-Robert in the bed!
60,00:03:09.79,00:03:09.79,"Camp life without John-Robert is much nicer, and I think that"
61,00:03:14.08,00:03:14.08,everyone else is also kind of happy to have him gone.
62,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00,Jean-Robert is such a complainer and demanding people to fetch
63,00:03:22.42,00:03:22.42,him things and just... just generally unpleasant.
64,00:03:40.29,00:03:40.29,">> Denise was, like, shooting daggers at myself and Amanda"
65,00:03:43.96,00:03:43.96,"because she was mad. By blindsiding Jean-Robert, we"
66,00:03:49.33,00:03:49.33,"had to blindside her too, and it could come back to get us."
67,00:03:55.33,00:03:55.33,">> We have a plan here that the former Fei Long, we're going to"
68,00:03:58.79,00:03:58.79,"vote out the Zhan Hu people. So last night at tribal council,"
69,00:04:03.12,00:04:03.12,"I went with the original plan. I voted Peih-Gee, like we were"
70,00:04:06.04,00:04:06.04,"supposed to. But I guess at the last moment,"
71,00:04:08.62,00:04:08.62,"everybody changed their minds, and half the tribe voted for"
72,00:04:11.42,00:04:11.42,Jean-Robert. It kind of makes me feel on the
73,00:04:14.92,00:04:14.92,"outside, because I had an opportunity to switch over to"
74,00:04:17.96,00:04:17.96,"Zhan Hu, and I decided to stay with the group that I'm close"
75,00:04:21.04,00:04:21.04,to. And I still get backstabbed.
76,00:04:23.75,00:04:23.75,It's a hard position for me right now.
77,00:04:25.67,00:04:25.67,">> You okay? The thing with last night, I"
78,00:04:28.38,00:04:28.38,don't know what happened. Everybody freaked out because...
79,00:04:34.67,00:04:34.67,>> But they were supposed to tell you at the end.
80,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,">> I mean, I felt like an idiot. I'm the only one that voted for"
81,00:04:37.88,00:04:37.88,"Peih-Gee. At the last second, they should"
82,00:04:39.54,00:04:39.54,"have told me. >> That's what the plan was,"
83,00:04:41.25,00:04:41.25,"honestly. >> You know, I mean, how I do"
84,00:04:43.12,00:04:43.12,feel at the end now? Do I feel like I'm the next one
85,00:04:45.96,00:04:45.96,"to go because I'm an idiot? >> No, you're still safe."
86,00:04:48.25,00:04:48.25,Just don't... we need to hold this together.
87,00:04:51.12,00:04:51.12,>> James has two hidden immunity idols.
88,00:04:53.38,00:04:53.38,"It's smart to stick with him. I mean, you never know what's"
89,00:04:55.96,00:04:55.96,"going to happen, but it is hard to trust people in this game."

92,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,>> You want the fire died down a little or...
93,00:06:12.50,00:06:12.50,">> No, I'm about to pick it back up."
94,00:06:14.54,00:06:14.54,">> You want it really hot. >> Yeah, thanks for telling me."
95,00:06:17.12,00:06:17.12,You're wanting to micromanaging me.
96,00:06:20.08,00:06:20.08,">> I'm just excited, okay? I'm just excited to eat."
97,00:06:22.42,00:06:22.42,">> Oh, my gosh, Jean-Robert was annoying, and now he's gone, but"
98,00:06:25.46,00:06:25.46,all of a sudden Peih-Gee decided to step in and take his place.
99,00:06:28.67,00:06:28.67,>> I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to micromanage
100,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,you. >> Even though Peih-Gee's not
101,00:06:43.58,00:06:43.58,"playing a very smart game, but the thing is is Courtney, she's"
102,00:06:47.08,00:06:47.08,"tight with Frosti, and she's flirting with him."
103,00:06:50.62,00:06:50.62,">> I know. No hot dogs, but pretty close."
104,00:06:53.62,00:06:53.62,">> I mean, it's scary. It really is."
105,00:06:55.08,00:06:55.08,"Because you never know if she's going to want to twist or turn,"
106,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,and that kind of worries me. >> Tree mail!
107,00:07:05.67,00:07:05.67,And we have a drum. >> You guys ready?
108,00:07:08.12,00:07:08.12,">> Yes. >> ""An experience of a lifetime"
109,00:07:11.12,00:07:11.12,"in a truly magical place, a feast of sights to feed your"
110,00:07:14.75,00:07:14.75,"soul, and you'll also feed your face."
111,00:07:17.79,00:07:17.79,Again you must divide to conquer.
112,00:07:20.21,00:07:20.21,"You better be on the ball. If you drum up some enthusiasm,"
113,00:07:24.38,00:07:24.38,"you might just win it all."" >> That drum is wicked."
114,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,">> I just want to win. I just hate that, like, I'm the"
115,00:07:33.38,00:07:33.38,most losingest survivor left in this game right now.
116,00:07:36.17,00:07:36.17,"Like, I've lost the most challenges out of everybody."
117,00:07:39.50,00:07:39.50,"Like, it kind of sucks, and that makes me want to win even more."
118,00:07:48.08,00:07:48.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"

127,00:08:23.17,00:08:23.17,"previous gate. When you reach the end, you must"
128,00:08:26.88,00:08:26.88,"bounce the ball in a finish bin, then race back to the start."

190,00:11:51.08,00:11:51.08,">> Todd, you ready? Take over."
191,00:11:54.46,00:11:54.46,">> PROBST: Red misses again. Frosti to Erik, a nice save by"
192,00:11:59.21,00:11:59.21,Erik. Another nice save by Erik.
193,00:12:03.25,00:12:03.25,Yellow again very close. Yellow very close to scoring
194,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,their second point. Yellow leads two-zip!
195,00:12:15.17,00:12:15.17,Red team got to make this one count.
196,00:12:19.38,00:12:19.38,Peih-Gee keeping it alive. Todd with a nice save.
197,00:12:23.58,00:12:23.58,>> Get over the line. Get over the thing.
198,00:12:25.38,00:12:25.38,>> PROBST: Red trying to score their first point.
199,00:12:27.92,00:12:27.92,"Todd to Peih-Gee, red very close."
200,00:12:32.67,00:12:32.67,But they lose it. >> Grab the ball!
201,00:12:34.62,00:12:34.62,Get back! Come on!
202,00:12:36.46,00:12:36.46,>> PROBST: Erik leading yellow up the hill with that third and
203,00:12:39.04,00:12:39.04,"final ball. Red team still on their first,"
204,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,"starting to panic. James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't"
205,00:12:48.04,00:12:48.04,get it. Yellow's making good ground with
206,00:12:51.67,00:12:51.67,that third and final ball. They've got a good rhythm going.
207,00:13:02.25,00:13:02.25,>> Get it! Get it!
208,00:13:04.67,00:13:04.67,">> PROBST: Red close, but misses again."
209,00:13:07.79,00:13:07.79,Red has to go back to the mat. As yellow heads up the hill with
210,00:13:10.79,00:13:10.79,"that third and final ball, they seem to have figured this out."
211,00:13:15.71,00:13:15.71,Erik to Frosti. This could be it.
212,00:13:20.12,00:13:20.12,Big reward on the line if they get it in.
213,00:13:22.58,00:13:22.58,>> Yes! >> PROBST: And they do!
214,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,"Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and Courtney cruising down the Lee"
215,00:13:27.25,00:13:27.25,"River. Okay, Erik, Frosti, Courtney,"
216,00:13:39.08,00:13:39.08,"Amanda, you will leave from here, be taken to the Lee River."
217,00:13:43.17,00:13:43.17,You will return to camp in the morning.
218,00:13:45.67,00:13:45.67,"James, Peih-Gee, Denise, Todd, your looks say it all."
219,00:13:50.21,00:13:50.21,I got nothing for you. Get your stuff.
220,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,Head back to camp. The reward is waiting.
221,00:13:55.92,00:13:55.92,Head out and have a good time. >> Thank you.
222,00:14:18.08,00:14:18.08,>> Uh-uh. I did not see your ass strolling
223,00:14:19.62,00:14:19.62,back to the mat every time we dropped the ball.
224,00:14:35.25,00:14:35.25,>> Uh-huh. I'm the one who was dropping the
225,00:14:37.08,00:14:37.08,"ball today? >> No, I was the only one."
226,00:14:39.67,00:14:39.67,">> I'm not saying it's your fault, James."
227,00:14:42.62,00:14:42.62,I'm not saying... no... what I'm saying is... I want...
228,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,Can I finish? Can I please finish?
229,00:14:50.50,00:14:50.50,">> No, you can't, because I don't care."
230,00:14:52.38,00:14:52.38,Please stop messing with me. Because every time you bring
231,00:14:54.25,00:14:54.25,"something up, I will quickly blast you back and make you look"
232,00:14:56.54,00:14:56.54,quite silly. >> Yeah?
233,00:14:58.71,00:14:58.71,">> Because every time you open your mouth, you're just speaking"
234,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,nonsense. That's why you lose.
235,00:15:02.00,00:15:02.00,>> Really? My ass wasn't strolling back to
236,00:15:04.08,00:15:04.08,the mat after ever time. I raced back to that damn mat.
237,00:15:08.04,00:15:08.04,"You know, I need to take a walk right now."
238,00:15:12.50,00:15:12.50,">> Peih-Gee, she's just stupid. I mean, she really came to me"
239,00:15:18.58,00:15:18.58,and said that I was the reason why they didn't... it's all my
240,00:15:21.79,00:15:21.79,fault. Maybe she's the problem.
241,00:15:25.17,00:15:25.17,"She's never won anything. I mean, maybe that's the sign."
242,00:15:28.17,00:15:28.17,"You know, not everybody is crazy."
243,00:15:30.54,00:15:30.54,You're the crazy one. >> I'm probably pissed off that
244,00:15:36.42,00:15:36.42,"we lost the challenge, and I'm taking it out on James, but I'm"
245,00:15:39.04,00:15:39.04,the only person who wasn't won any reward challenges.
246,00:15:42.08,00:15:42.08,"I'm pissed about it. Like, I'd love to go on a"
247,00:15:44.08,00:15:44.08,"reward, but I don't have a single ally here."
248,00:15:47.17,00:15:47.17,"I don't have anybody. I'm in, like, a really bad"
249,00:15:49.25,00:15:49.25,position. It's probably not smart to go
250,00:15:51.75,00:15:51.75,"around picking fights with people, but I can't, like, keep"
251,00:15:54.42,00:15:54.42,"my mouth shut sometimes. >> Oh, I didn't hear what she"
252,00:15:59.92,00:15:59.92,"was saying, but I heard her yelling."
253,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,">> She came over to me, saying it's my fault we lost."
254,00:16:03.04,00:16:03.04,">> It's your fault? >> Yeah, my fault, because I let"
255,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,the ball drop... >> She dropped the ball a couple
256,00:16:08.08,00:16:08.08,times. Everybody did.
257,00:16:10.83,00:16:10.83,>> Everybody dropped the ball. It just wasn't our day.
258,00:16:13.83,00:16:13.83,But that thing... she... ooh. Is she serious?
259,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,Is she serious? >> I don't like her attitude at
260,00:16:22.17,00:16:22.17,all. >> She really came over here and
261,00:16:23.62,00:16:23.62,was blaming me. That's some nerve.
262,00:16:25.29,00:16:25.29,>> It is nerve. It's crazy.
263,00:16:27.12,00:16:27.12,">> That's why we need to focus. We need to keep trying to focus,"
264,00:16:29.88,00:16:29.88,and we all need to focus and just pick them people off.
265,00:16:32.25,00:16:32.25,I'm trying to keep away from temptation from Zhan Hu.
266,00:16:35.08,00:16:35.08,"Them little pretty boys and the little annoying little girl,"
267,00:16:38.88,00:16:38.88,they are still enemies. They're still trying to
268,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,infiltrate the force to get where we already have
269,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,predestined ourselves to be. Amanda is going to be all right.
270,00:16:47.42,00:16:47.42,"Courtney, she's flaky, but she's going to fall in line."
271,00:16:50.42,00:16:50.42,Her... hopefully her and what's his name don't have a big
272,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,"romance tonight, which might happen."
273,00:16:56.21,00:16:56.21,That would hurt. It makes no sense for us to mess
274,00:16:59.08,00:16:59.08,"it up now, but it's so human nature."
275,00:17:01.42,00:17:01.42,"I mean, it's right there in front of you."
276,00:17:03.33,00:17:03.33,Just don't eat the damn apple. Be naked and be happy.
277,00:17:07.21,00:17:07.21,Don't eat that damn apple. I hope that Courtney don't flip.
278,00:17:10.00,00:17:10.00,>> Uh-huh. >> Because Courtney would do
279,00:17:12.25,00:17:12.25,that for love. >> This is probably the worst
280,00:17:15.25,00:17:15.25,day that I can have out here. People are freaking out around
281,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,"camp, and the four people I get along best with are out having a"
282,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,good time on a boat somewhere. Today sucks.
283,00:17:38.12,00:17:38.12,">> All right, everyone, cheers to us."
284,00:17:39.46,00:17:39.46,Cheers! >> Cheers.
285,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,>> What great win today. >> Yeah.
286,00:17:43.08,00:17:43.08,>> What a good win. I haven't won hardly any
287,00:17:45.58,00:17:45.58,"challenges since I've been out here, so I was amped up to win."
288,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,The reward was for this cruise on the Lee River.
289,00:17:54.50,00:17:54.50,It was spectacular. I felt like it was a pretty cool
290,00:18:02.21,00:18:02.21,"group of people, and you know, of course it was a good"
291,00:18:04.62,00:18:04.62,opportunity to just get to know them a little better and try
292,00:18:07.75,00:18:07.75,"and, you know, develop relationships."
293,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,I'm just wondering what it's like back at camp.
294,00:18:13.62,00:18:13.62,>> I like Peih-Gee. I just...
295,00:18:15.62,00:18:15.62,>> I wanted to like her. >> She's making me annoyed with
296,00:18:17.25,00:18:17.25,"her. >> She is cool, like, when she's"
297,00:18:18.62,00:18:18.62,relaxing and just kind of hanging.
298,00:18:20.04,00:18:20.04,">> Yeah, but she's... >> She's totally cool."
299,00:18:21.21,00:18:21.21,">> She's too intense right now, and I don't... I don't like"
300,00:18:22.96,00:18:22.96,"that. >> She doesn't want to lose, and"
301,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,"I think she feels like she's powerless, but, like, she's made"
302,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83,"a series of poor decisions. >> As much as I'm, like, still"
303,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"basically on Peih-Gee's side, I don't mind her being talked"
304,00:18:33.25,00:18:33.25,about negatively simply because it means if she's getting talked
305,00:18:36.04,00:18:36.04,"about, then I'm not. >> Here's to us."
306,00:18:39.04,00:18:39.04,>> Yeah. >> Because we're still here.
307,00:18:41.17,00:18:41.17,>> Whoo! >> Yay!
308,00:18:43.04,00:18:43.04,>> Yay! >> And on a boat.
309,00:18:55.38,00:18:55.38,>> This is definitely where I want to be.
310,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,>> And the night is young. >> The night is young.
311,00:18:59.54,00:18:59.54,>> And I'm feeling quite jolly already.
312,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,>> Yay! Jolly!
313,00:19:04.38,00:19:04.38,I love my Frosti. I love my Frosti.
314,00:19:07.12,00:19:07.12,I don't really understand my relationship with Frosti.
315,00:19:09.54,00:19:09.54,He's young. He's only 20.
316,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,And he's kind of cute. He just wants to play.
317,00:19:14.75,00:19:14.75,I love our reward. The path of righteousness has
318,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,led us in the right direction. >> I like Courtney a lot.
319,00:19:24.04,00:19:24.04,"And I think both of us feel that, and that's good."
320,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,She's a really attractive girl. She's smart.
321,00:19:31.04,00:19:31.04,"She's way out of my league, but having somebody that you're just"
322,00:19:35.50,00:19:35.50,comfortable around is really nice.
323,00:19:44.21,00:19:44.21,>> Look how high that is straight up.
324,00:19:46.38,00:19:46.38,">> Oh, my God, unreal. This is like the greatest"
325,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,"adventure, like, in China possible."
326,00:19:53.50,00:19:53.50,"Oh, my gosh, it's a goat, you guys!"
327,00:19:55.12,00:19:55.12,I'm not even kidding. >> Where?
328,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,>> That black thing right there. >> And the white thing.
329,00:19:59.12,00:19:59.12,( Erik imitating a goat ) >> That's good.
330,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,Not only does it sound good. You do the face.
331,00:20:06.38,00:20:06.38,"( Erik imitating a goat ) Erik, stop hitting on the goats."
332,00:20:10.33,00:20:10.33,They're a couple. ( Erik imitating a goat )
333,00:20:14.04,00:20:14.04,>> I feel like we had a great time together.
334,00:20:16.29,00:20:16.29,"Maybe it helped me in Courtney and Amanda's eyes, and maybe"
335,00:20:19.29,00:20:19.29,that's enough to at least save me another round.
336,00:20:22.08,00:20:22.08,( Erik imitating a goat ) >> I think that's the greatest
337,00:20:27.33,00:20:27.33,"impression I've ever heard. Congratulations, Erik."
338,00:20:30.21,00:20:30.21,>> I do what I can. I do what I can.
339,00:20:32.04,00:20:32.04,>> I really like Erik. I know he's here to play the
340,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,"game as well, but I think he's adorable, and I definitely want"
341,00:20:36.58,00:20:36.58,to see him around as long as possible.
342,00:20:39.21,00:20:39.21,"I really like him. >> Oh, my God!"
343,00:20:46.46,00:20:46.46,"Is that fried chicken? Oh, my god!"
344,00:20:49.29,00:20:49.29,This is the greatest day of my life.
345,00:20:51.96,00:20:51.96,What is that? Mashed potatoes.
346,00:20:54.79,00:20:54.79,Thank you! >> Thank you!
347,00:20:57.04,00:20:57.04,">> Oh, my God. >> Fried chicken!"
348,00:21:01.04,00:21:01.04,">> Erik, he is a threat, and he's been doing a really good"
349,00:21:03.42,00:21:03.42,job of getting close to Amanda and Courtney.
350,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,"I don't know, it does worry me, just because... I mean, there's"
351,00:21:11.29,00:21:11.29,"no reason they couldn't be like, ""Oh, well, why don't we just"
352,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,"take Erik instead of Frosti?"" It's scary."
353,00:21:17.08,00:21:17.08,I don't want to be replaced. >> Someone's coming in.
354,00:21:38.04,00:21:38.04,"Hey, bitches, welcome home! >> Hey."
355,00:21:41.79,00:21:41.79,>> We want to hear all about it. >> Juicy details.
356,00:21:44.08,00:21:44.08,">> We had Chinese food, the same thing that we had..."
357,00:21:46.58,00:21:46.58,">> Chinese food. >> Oh, it was so fun."
358,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,Talk it up. We need details.
359,00:21:53.12,00:21:53.12,>> We lied to everyone because if we would have told them we
360,00:21:56.00,00:21:56.00,"would have had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and bread and"
361,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,"butter, everyone would have hated us for sure."
362,00:22:00.38,00:22:00.38,">> It was a nice cruise though. >> No, it was really cool."
363,00:22:02.42,00:22:02.42,">> It was nice, and the scenery was beautiful."
364,00:22:04.04,00:22:04.04,>> It was really pretty. >> It was nice.
365,00:22:06.12,00:22:06.12,">> What's been going on around here, just the same old, trying"
366,00:22:08.04,00:22:08.04,to get food and water? >> Pretty much.
367,00:22:16.71,00:22:16.71,">> Todd, we missed you. >> It's so nice to have you guys"
368,00:22:19.21,00:22:19.21,"back, though. I mean, this is the thing."
369,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,"Like, you know, believe it or not, Peih-Gee just lost it and"
370,00:22:23.21,00:22:23.21,just started screaming at James. >> When you guys got back?
371,00:22:26.12,00:22:26.12,">> Yeah. Screaming at James, like, ""You"
372,00:22:28.38,00:22:28.38,"can't bounce a ball on a drum and..."" da, da, da, da."
373,00:22:32.62,00:22:32.62,"She freaked out on him. >> Oh, my God."
374,00:22:35.62,00:22:35.62,">> He was like, ""Bitch, what are you talking about?"""
375,00:22:40.00,00:22:40.00,>> That sounds like a Jean- Robert move.
376,00:22:41.58,00:22:41.58,">> Yeah, it is a Jean-Robert move."
377,00:22:43.08,00:22:43.08,>> Peih-Gee is not necessarily in most people's good graces
378,00:22:45.75,00:22:45.75,"right now, so hopefully I'll be safe, unless Peih-Gee wins"
379,00:22:48.83,00:22:48.83,"immunity, and then it's a whole new story."
380,00:22:58.08,00:22:58.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"
381,00:23:10.08,00:23:10.08,immunity challenge? >> Yes.
382,00:23:12.08,00:23:12.08,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
383,00:23:14.12,00:23:14.12,"Courtney, time to give it up. >> Oh, and it looked so cute on"
384,00:23:16.12,00:23:16.12,her too. >> PROBST: Once again immunity
385,00:23:23.75,00:23:23.75,is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge will
386,00:23:28.08,00:23:28.08,test your memory. You will each have a series of
387,00:23:34.04,00:23:34.04,Chinese zodiac symbols in front of you.
388,00:23:36.79,00:23:36.79,"Each round, I will call out a list of those symbols."
389,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,You must then use your knife to stab them in the correct order.
390,00:23:45.71,00:23:45.71,"Get it right, you stay in. Get it wrong, you're out."
391,00:23:48.79,00:23:48.79,"Last person left standing wins immunity, is guaranteed a one-"
392,00:23:53.42,00:23:53.42,in-seven shot at winning this game.
393,00:23:58.46,00:23:58.46,"Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody will be going home."
394,00:24:01.25,00:24:01.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: If you feel so
395,00:24:05.33,00:24:05.33,"comfortable you don't think you need immunity tonight, you can"
396,00:24:09.04,00:24:09.04,opt not to play in the challenge and instead...
397,00:24:12.42,00:24:12.42,>> No. >> PROBST: ...you can eat.
398,00:24:15.71,00:24:15.71,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh!"
399,00:24:17.21,00:24:17.21,>> That's okay. >> Don't do that.
400,00:24:19.21,00:24:19.21,>> That is so wrong. >> PROBST: Cheeseburgers.
401,00:24:23.08,00:24:23.08,"French fries. >> Oh, my God!"
402,00:24:25.21,00:24:25.21,">> PROBST: Cold drinks. >> Oh, my God!"
403,00:24:28.96,00:24:28.96,">> PROBST: And all the fixings. >> Oh, my God!"
404,00:24:32.25,00:24:32.25,>> That is mean! >> PROBST: I'm going to give
405,00:24:35.79,00:24:35.79,each of you a white coin and a black coin.
406,00:24:38.25,00:24:38.25,Black means you want to eat. White means you want to play.
407,00:24:42.92,00:24:42.92,I'll hand them out. Don't do anything with them yet.
408,00:24:45.46,00:24:45.46,Keep them both together. Make sure they're separated.
409,00:24:48.58,00:24:48.58,Black means you want to eat. White means you want to play.
410,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,This is a simple case of temptation.
411,00:24:55.75,00:24:55.75,"So now I want everybody to choose one coin, put it in your"
412,00:24:58.21,00:24:58.21,"right hand, put your right hand out."
413,00:25:01.62,00:25:01.62,"Three, two, one, reveal. Courtney's decided she wants to"
414,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,eat. Todd is going to eat.
415,00:25:08.00,00:25:08.00,Denise is going to eat. And James is going to eat.
416,00:25:11.62,00:25:11.62,"Take a spot at your feast bench. Peih-Gee, Frosti, Amanda, and"
417,00:25:18.92,00:25:18.92,Erik are playing to win this game.
418,00:25:22.88,00:25:22.88,"All right, here's how it will work."
419,00:25:25.25,00:25:25.25,"When we start, you guys can begin eating."
420,00:25:27.71,00:25:27.71,"You can eat for as long as the challenge takes, until we have a"
421,00:25:30.50,00:25:30.50,winner. The challenge is now beginning.
422,00:25:33.21,00:25:33.21,"Dig in. Here we go, first round."
423,00:25:43.38,00:25:43.38,"Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog. Go."
424,00:26:00.75,00:26:00.75,"Let's see how we do. Tiger, rat is wrong."
425,00:26:08.12,00:26:08.12,"Erik, take a spot. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog"
426,00:26:15.88,00:26:15.88,is right. Amanda is still in.
427,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,"Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog is right."
428,00:26:26.25,00:26:26.25,"Peih-Gee is still in. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog."
429,00:26:32.29,00:26:32.29,"Frosti is still in. Erik, that has got to be tough"
430,00:26:39.88,00:26:39.88,"now. You didn't make it one round,"
431,00:26:42.25,00:26:42.25,"and you're looking at cheeseburgers, fries, fixings."
432,00:26:46.04,00:26:46.04,>> Can't do anything about it. I'm going to make the most of
433,00:26:48.38,00:26:48.38,"it, sit here, and smell it. >> PROBST: Courtney, how's that"
434,00:26:51.71,00:26:51.71,burger? >> Great.
435,00:26:55.17,00:26:55.17,>> Probably the best food I've ever had in my life right now.
436,00:26:57.25,00:26:57.25,">> PROBST: We are down to three. Next round: rat, ram, dragon,"
437,00:27:01.75,00:27:01.75,"rooster, ram. Frosti struggling to get that"
438,00:27:18.12,00:27:18.12,last one. You're committed to what you
439,00:27:19.75,00:27:19.75,"have. >> Come on, Frosti."
440,00:27:23.21,00:27:23.21,"Go, Frosti. >> PROBST: Frosti makes a"
441,00:27:27.42,00:27:27.42,choice. Let's find out if he's right.
442,00:27:32.04,00:27:32.04,"Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. Rat, ram, dragon, rat is wrong."
443,00:27:41.92,00:27:41.92,"Amanda has it wrong. Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram."
444,00:27:51.04,00:27:51.04,"Peih-Gee has it right. That means Amanda, you can take"
445,00:27:53.12,00:27:53.12,"a seat. >> Oh, my God!"
446,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,>> PROBST: It comes down to this.
447,00:27:57.96,00:27:57.96,"Peih-Gee has it right. Frosti, if you have it wrong,"
448,00:28:00.71,00:28:00.71,Peih-Gee wins immunity. >> I'm going crazy.
449,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,"I'm losing my mind. >> PROBST: Rat, ram, dragon,"
450,00:28:07.54,00:28:07.54,"rooster, ram is what you need to have to stay alive."
451,00:28:11.42,00:28:11.42,"Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. You got it right."
452,00:28:18.42,00:28:18.42,>> Yay! >> PROBST: You're still alive.
453,00:28:21.04,00:28:21.04,We are down to two-- immunity and a guarantee of a one-in-
454,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,seven shot of winning this game. Here we go.
455,00:28:30.50,00:28:30.50,"Snake, rat, rabbit, tiger, rooster, ram."
456,00:28:46.54,00:28:46.54,">> Come on, Frosti. >> PROBST: Snake, rat, rabbit,"
457,00:28:58.08,00:28:58.08,"tiger, rooster, ram. What are you upset about?"
458,00:29:02.17,00:29:02.17,>> I don't know. I think I lost my mind with
459,00:29:03.96,00:29:03.96,"Frosti. >> PROBST: Snake, rat, rabbit,"
460,00:29:10.50,00:29:10.50,"tiger, rooster, ram. I think you got it right."
461,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,"Peih-Gee has it right again. >> Oh, my God!"
462,00:29:18.08,00:29:18.08,">> PROBST: Frosti, you have to have it right to stay alive in"
463,00:29:19.71,00:29:19.71,"this. Snake, the second one was rat."
464,00:29:26.08,00:29:26.08,You have rabbit. It's over.
465,00:29:28.33,00:29:28.33,"Peih-Gee wins immunity. >> Oh, my God!"
466,00:29:30.50,00:29:30.50,">> PROBST: Congratulations. And with that, stop eating."
467,00:29:36.92,00:29:36.92,"Whatever you got in your mouth, you can finish."
468,00:29:38.54,00:29:38.54,What's in your hands you need to set down.
469,00:29:41.92,00:29:41.92,Give you a minute to swallow. >> I'm covered in mayonnaise.
470,00:29:46.54,00:29:46.54,">> It's on your leg. >> PROBST: Peih-Gee, the only"
471,00:29:53.17,00:29:53.17,thing on day 27 better than a cheeseburger is this right here.
472,00:29:57.08,00:29:57.08,">> That's right, baby. >> PROBST: Individual immunity"
473,00:29:58.71,00:29:58.71,"guarantees you safe tonight at tribal council, one-in-seven"
474,00:30:01.25,00:30:01.25,"shot at winning this game. Frosti, Todd, Amanda, Erik,"
475,00:30:05.12,00:30:05.12,"Denise, Courtney, and James, one of the seven you are going home"
476,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,tonight. See you at tribal.
477,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,Head on back. >> How much did you guys eat?
478,00:30:28.46,00:30:28.46,>> I had two burgers and a ton of fries and two things of cola.
479,00:30:31.92,00:30:31.92,And I hated myself for that. >> It's hard to know that I took
480,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,"a risk, made a sacrifice, and nothing really came out of it."
481,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,"I am upset that James, Denise, Todd, and Courtney sat out."
482,00:30:45.46,00:30:45.46,"Like, we're here for 12 more days."
483,00:30:47.38,00:30:47.38,You can't wait 12 days for a cheeseburger?
484,00:30:52.50,00:30:52.50,">> Frosti, you fought hard. I did terrible."
485,00:30:57.29,00:30:57.29,>> Not winning immunity today and having Peih-Gee win means
486,00:31:00.50,00:31:00.50,that we can't vote her out. So I think Erik kind of already
487,00:31:03.79,00:31:03.79,knows that he's on the chopping block.
488,00:31:06.25,00:31:06.25,">> Well, if I go tonight, good luck to you."
489,00:31:09.79,00:31:09.79,">> If I go tonight, good luck to you."
490,00:31:13.29,00:31:13.29,And we still didn't get cheeseburgers.
491,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,">> Since Peih-Gee won immunity, that means Frosti and I are kind"
492,00:31:19.04,00:31:19.04,"of the obvious ones to go, you know, probably going to be one"
493,00:31:22.42,00:31:22.42,"of us. And Frosti, I feel like he's..."
494,00:31:26.79,00:31:26.79,"somehow, you know, he's worked his way... I think he's in good"
495,00:31:29.25,00:31:29.25,with Todd and Amanda and Courtney.
496,00:31:32.21,00:31:32.21,So it definitely makes it seem like Frosti might be higher up
497,00:31:34.92,00:31:34.92,"the ladder than he once was. But then again, you know, I'm"
498,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,tight with that group now. So maybe that puts me up the
499,00:31:40.83,00:31:40.83,ladder as well. So we'll see.
500,00:31:49.00,00:31:49.00,">> We have to be careful with Erik, because he's not like"
501,00:31:51.38,00:31:51.38,Peih-Gee. He's not overbearing.
502,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,He's not abrasive. But he's really good at
503,00:31:56.33,00:31:56.33,making... especially the girls. >> He's smooth.
504,00:32:00.29,00:32:00.29,>> They love him. >> And he plays up the good old
505,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,"country boy from Tennessee. >> I mean, he's a great guy."
506,00:32:09.04,00:32:09.04,"And, like, he's awesome to have around, but just got to be"
507,00:32:12.25,00:32:12.25,"careful. >> It's like, ""Here you go, have"
508,00:32:14.12,00:32:14.12,"a million dollars, Erik."" Tonight's vote's killer."
509,00:32:19.12,00:32:19.12,"I mean, Erik, if he makes it to the end, hands down, he's"
510,00:32:23.21,00:32:23.21,guaranteed a million dollars. But Frosti's a big threat.
511,00:32:28.92,00:32:28.92,"You watch him perform in any of the challenges, and he is great,"
512,00:32:31.50,00:32:31.50,you know. And that kind of worries me.
513,00:32:34.08,00:32:34.08,So I don't know what I'm going to do.
514,00:32:35.75,00:32:35.75,It's a toss-up. Frosti and Erik?
515,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,>> One of them guys is leaving. >> Has to go.
516,00:32:41.58,00:32:41.58,We have to get rid of one of those two.
517,00:32:44.00,00:32:44.00,"I mean, I love Frosti. I'll write his name down."
518,00:32:46.88,00:32:46.88,Courtney is really tight with him.
519,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,"If we have to, we pull her in to get rid of Frosti."
520,00:32:51.38,00:32:51.38,She'll vote for Frosti. >> I'm not sure you want to
521,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"trust her, though. I mean, she thinks her Frosti's"
522,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,with her. >> Courtney...
523,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,>> We can convince Courtney. >> You sure?
524,00:33:01.54,00:33:01.54,She's loving the hell out of Frosti.
525,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,">> If she can't realize that, if she really can't realize that,"
526,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,maybe we should turn it around and get rid of her.
527,00:33:09.71,00:33:09.71,">> The last tribal council we went to, I thought everybody was"
528,00:33:12.29,00:33:12.29,voting for Peih-Gee. It turned out everybody was
529,00:33:14.25,00:33:14.25,voting for JR. Tonight I really don't feel
530,00:33:17.42,00:33:17.42,"paranoid, because at least I think I know who everybody's"
531,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,voting for. It's either going to be Frosti
532,00:33:22.33,00:33:22.33,or it's going to be Courtney that goes tonight.
533,00:33:30.62,00:33:30.62,">> Obviously, and it sucks, but what are we at, eight?"
534,00:33:32.79,00:33:32.79,Get rid of Erik or Frosti. >> So Erik or Frosti.
535,00:33:36.62,00:33:36.62,">> Has to, right? James and Denise are scared to"
536,00:33:40.04,00:33:40.04,death that you would not be willing to vote against Frosti.
537,00:33:43.04,00:33:43.04,">> Oh, really? >> Yeah."
538,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,Yes. And would you?
539,00:33:48.25,00:33:48.25,">> Frosti is kind of like my little Munchkin, and you know,"
540,00:33:50.42,00:33:50.42,"everyone's kind of worried about me because they know that he's,"
541,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,"you know, like, my good friend. >> You've seen him compete."
542,00:33:56.96,00:33:56.96,"I love the kid, but we don't have a choice, right?"
543,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,">> We'll see how it goes. It really does, like,"
544,00:34:04.04,00:34:04.04,"strategically make a difference whether or not, you know, I go"
545,00:34:06.83,00:34:06.83,with the group on this one or I don't go with the group on this
546,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,one. So I don't know.
547,00:34:10.21,00:34:10.21,"I mean, honestly, I don't know who I'll vote for."
548,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,>> James and Denise were very worried about Courtney and her
549,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,friendship with Frosti. I'm worried.
550,00:34:20.62,00:34:20.62,"I mean, we just don't know what to expect."
551,00:34:23.00,00:34:23.00,She could literally take a sharp turn right at any moment.
552,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,"You know, I may have to vote for her."
553,00:34:55.38,00:34:55.38,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury, Jaime"
554,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,"and Jean-Robert, voted out at the last tribal council."
555,00:35:08.58,00:35:08.58,Let's talk about today's immunity challenge.
556,00:35:10.83,00:35:10.83,"James, of all the people that would choose to eat over"
557,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,"fighting for immunity, I have to say you surprised me the most."
558,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,"When you saw that plate of cheeseburgers, what was your"
559,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,initial thought? >> Attack.
560,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,( laughter ) I ate seven of them.
561,00:35:28.75,00:35:28.75,>> PROBST: You ate set of the 12?
562,00:35:30.75,00:35:30.75,>> I ate seven burgers. And I would have eaten that last
563,00:35:33.25,00:35:33.25,one. I'm not playing.
564,00:35:34.96,00:35:34.96,"I was hungry. Yes, I have a strong ability to"
565,00:35:37.75,00:35:37.75,"win, and if I would have competed, I would have competed"
566,00:35:39.71,00:35:39.71,"with my whole heart, but I'm telling you, it was meat, man."
567,00:35:44.42,00:35:44.42,">> PROBST: Todd, you have a one- in-even shot if you win today's"
568,00:35:47.08,00:35:47.08,"challenge, and yet you opted for food."
569,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,">> The second you took the lid off of those burgers and fries,"
570,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,"fat kid inside of Todd said, ""Food, eat, you are so hungry,"""
571,00:35:58.25,00:35:58.25,you know? And it's very risky putting
572,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83,"yourself in that situation, especially when you tell"
573,00:36:03.92,00:36:03.92,"yourself you would never do it. >> PROBST: Frosti, why did you"
574,00:36:08.08,00:36:08.08,"choose to not eat? >> Well, I know that being here,"
575,00:36:12.46,00:36:12.46,"there's always a chance that you could go home, no matter how"
576,00:36:14.71,00:36:14.71,"comfortable you feel, and that's a chance that some people"
577,00:36:17.88,00:36:17.88,decided to take. But I want to know that I've
578,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,"done everything I can to do my best, to try my hardest, so that"
579,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,"if I do go home, I know that it's not because I didn't do"
580,00:36:31.08,00:36:31.08,"everything I could. >> PROBST: Erik, of the four"
581,00:36:34.25,00:36:34.25,"people that chose to sit out, do you think it's a sign that they"
582,00:36:36.88,00:36:36.88,are comfortable enough with their status in the tribe that
583,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,they can eat and still be here at the end of this tribal?
584,00:36:42.75,00:36:42.75,">> I knew I had to do the challenge, so that definitely"
585,00:36:45.58,00:36:45.58,draws a distinction between where I am and where the people
586,00:36:48.67,00:36:48.67,that were eating are. >> PROBST: Where are you in this
587,00:36:50.96,00:36:50.96,tribe? >> I feel like I'm honestly
588,00:36:53.62,00:36:53.62,"somewhere at the bottom, and frankly, tonight I feel like I'm"
589,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,very far at the bottom. There's a chance I could make it
590,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,"through tonight, but I'm not necessarily planning on it."
591,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,>> PROBST: We're at a point in the game where there are two
592,00:37:04.67,00:37:04.67,different types of relationships: strategy
593,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,"relationships, then relationships that might extend"
594,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,"after the game. Amanda, are those two"
595,00:37:12.62,00:37:12.62,relationships starting to butt heads yet when it comes to who
596,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,"you vote out? >> It's a hard thing, having"
597,00:37:18.21,00:37:18.21,"friendships and then trying to play this game, because they"
598,00:37:21.88,00:37:21.88,don't always follow the same path.
599,00:37:24.96,00:37:24.96,"So it's a hard thing to juggle. >> PROBST: Denise, if you make a"
600,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,"friendship with somebody out here, do you expect a little"
601,00:37:30.71,00:37:30.71,more loyalty than somebody that maybe they don't like?
602,00:37:33.92,00:37:33.92,">> I mean, you would hope that the loyalty would be there, but"
603,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,there is no loyalty in a game like this.
604,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,There is no real down-to-the- bottom trust.
605,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,"I mean, it's a game. I mean, you hope that the"
606,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,friendships that you make and the bonds that you create over
607,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,all this time will last in the end.
608,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,">> PROBST: Frosti, what does it say about you that you're still"
609,00:37:53.29,00:37:53.29,here after being selected from Fei Long presumably with the
610,00:37:57.25,00:37:57.25,"idea to get rid of? >> Well, I do believe that"
611,00:38:01.04,00:38:01.04,forming the relationships that I did with the whole tribe really
612,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,"did help me. And yes, sometimes you do have"
613,00:38:08.33,00:38:08.33,to hurt people that you've gotten close to.
614,00:38:11.83,00:38:11.83,"But it is a game, and everyone understands that."
615,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,"And sometimes in games, people get hurt."
616,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,">> PROBST: Erik, does it ever feel personal?"
617,00:38:22.21,00:38:22.21,">> Yeah. I mean, it's hard, because I"
618,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83,"feel like I've meant to make friends too, and at some point,"
619,00:38:27.50,00:38:27.50,"there's only so much I can do, you know, on the chopping block."
620,00:38:30.04,00:38:30.04,"But of course, as far as, like, trying to scheme and, like, get"
621,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,"myself in good with a select few, although somewhat"
622,00:38:35.96,00:38:35.96,"necessary, also can be very detrimental."
623,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,"So I've really tried to be careful, and you know, I have"
624,00:38:40.92,00:38:40.92,"very few options at this point tonight, but...."
625,00:38:44.79,00:38:44.79,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to get to the vote."
626,00:38:46.38,00:38:46.38,"Peih-Gee, I don't even have to ask."
627,00:38:47.88,00:38:47.88,I know you're not giving up that necklace.
628,00:38:50.08,00:38:50.08,Peih-Gee is safe. You cannot vote for Peih-Gee.
629,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
630,00:38:55.08,00:38:55.08,"Todd, you're up. >> One of us will be eating"
631,00:39:15.04,00:39:15.04,cheeseburgers before the other. Neither of us deserved it.
632,00:39:32.17,00:39:32.17,">> It's you and me tonight, bro. Nothing personal."
633,00:39:46.92,00:39:46.92,>> I think you're an amazing person.
634,00:39:48.54,00:39:48.54,I'm sorry. I hope we can be friends later.
635,00:39:50.92,00:39:50.92,Bye. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
636,00:40:02.29,00:40:02.29,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
637,00:40:14.96,00:40:14.96,decision is final. The person voted out will be
638,00:40:16.88,00:40:16.88,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
639,00:40:19.50,00:40:19.50,"If anyone has the hidden immunity idol, now is the time"
640,00:40:21.50,00:40:21.50,to play it. I'll read the votes.
641,00:40:32.00,00:40:32.00,"First vote, Frosti. Erik."
642,00:40:40.71,00:40:40.71,"Frosti. Two votes Frosti, one vote Erik."
643,00:40:46.96,00:40:46.96,"Frosti. Three votes Frosti, one vote"
644,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,"Erik. Frosti, it's four votes Frosti."
645,00:40:59.12,00:40:59.12,"Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury,"
646,00:41:01.71,00:41:01.71,Frosti. That's five.
647,00:41:03.71,00:41:03.71,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
648,00:41:15.17,00:41:15.17,"Frosti, the tribe has spoken. >> With cheeseburgers still on"
649,00:41:18.00,00:41:18.00,their breath. >> PROBST: Time for you to go.
650,00:41:31.12,00:41:31.12,"Well, you've made it a long ways in this game, but there are"
651,00:41:33.54,00:41:33.54,"still 12 days left. Now, more than ever, the ability"
652,00:41:37.25,00:41:37.25,to adapt moment to moment is what's going to keep you in this
653,00:41:41.25,00:41:41.25,game. We're going to test that right
654,00:41:43.21,00:41:43.21,now. Tonight you will not be heading
655,00:41:49.12,00:41:49.12,directly back to camp. We have more business to attend
656,00:41:56.04,00:41:56.04,to here.  Captioning sponsored by

670,00:42:40.29,00:42:40.29,"kind of backstab, but I didn't expect it right now."

673,00:42:49.67,00:42:49.67,"But you know, I wanted to prove that somebody who is younger,"
674,00:42:53.42,00:42:53.42,smaller could come out here and do the same job that anyone else
675,00:42:56.21,00:42:56.21,"can do, and I have proved that."
