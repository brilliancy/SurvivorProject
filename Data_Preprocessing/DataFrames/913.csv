3,00:00:04.54,00:00:04.54,>> You didn't screw me. I'm still in the game.
4,00:00:06.12,00:00:06.12,You screwed Leann. >> PROBST: While Ami felt
5,00:00:08.12,00:00:08.12,"betrayed after her ally Leann was voted out, Twila and Scout"
6,00:00:10.92,00:00:10.92,felt good about what they had done.
7,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,>> We've overthrown the queen. I have a great mind sometimes.
8,00:00:16.12,00:00:16.12,I love it. >> PROBST: At the reward
9,00:00:18.04,00:00:18.04,challenge... >> No way.
10,00:00:20.17,00:00:20.17,>> PROBST: ...the tribe learned that the first-place finisher
11,00:00:22.46,00:00:22.46,would win a new car. >> Nice.
12,00:00:24.46,00:00:24.46,>> PROBST: And that the winner and the two runners-up would
13,00:00:27.04,00:00:27.04,drive to the other side of the island for a night of pampering.
14,00:00:31.12,00:00:31.12,Survivors ready... go! Ami first in to dive
15,00:00:35.08,00:00:35.08,"for her flag. Ami led the entire race, but in"
16,00:00:38.38,00:00:38.38,the end... Nice job.
17,00:00:40.00,00:00:40.00,...Eliza came away with the car and Ami placed second.
18,00:00:43.58,00:00:43.58,"Chris, the third-place finisher going on the overnight reward."
19,00:00:47.71,00:00:47.71,"(cheering) Eliza, Ami and Chris drove to a"
20,00:00:50.50,00:00:50.50,"luxury spot. >> Oh, my gosh."
21,00:00:53.12,00:00:53.12,">> And enjoyed a hot shower, local entertainment..."
22,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,>> I'm not stopping anytime soon.
23,00:00:57.29,00:00:57.29,>> ...and an all-you-can- eat gourmet dinner.
24,00:01:00.00,00:01:00.00,>> Listen... >> PROBST: Ami worked strategy
25,00:01:02.62,00:01:02.62,on Chris and Eliza. >> I think it would be
26,00:01:04.88,00:01:04.88,"really smart for you guys, is to break up Scout and Twila."
27,00:01:07.12,00:01:07.12,>> PROBST: But Chris wasn't about to let Ami stay
28,00:01:09.04,00:01:09.04,"in the game. >> Does she think I'm stupid,"
29,00:01:11.17,00:01:11.17,"you know? She's still working Eliza,"
30,00:01:13.17,00:01:13.17,though. She's strategizing.
31,00:01:14.79,00:01:14.79,"We're pure final four and look at our competition, a 60-year-"
32,00:01:18.79,00:01:18.79,old woman and Twila. I'm counting on the fact that
33,00:01:21.79,00:01:21.79,"Eliza is mentally strong. >> Good night, Chris."
34,00:01:23.88,00:01:23.88,">> PROBST: But when Ami was alone with Eliza, the strategy"
35,00:01:27.12,00:01:27.12,talk continued. >> Every single time I've
36,00:01:29.92,00:01:29.92,had your back. >> ELIZA: Ami has stood up for
37,00:01:32.12,00:01:32.12,me a lot of times. Ami has been like a big sister
38,00:01:34.12,00:01:34.12,to me out here. >> PROBST: At the Immunity
39,00:01:36.67,00:01:36.67,"Challenge, it came down to Chris and Ami..."
40,00:01:39.79,00:01:39.79,Chris is on! ...but Ami couldn't come
41,00:01:42.04,00:01:42.04,through. Chris wins immunity.
42,00:01:44.21,00:01:44.21,And Chris was safe for three more days.
43,00:01:48.50,00:01:48.50,"Back at camp, Eliza considered siding with Ami and Julie to"
44,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,"vote out Scout. >> Oh, she would be so mad."
45,00:01:55.04,00:01:55.04,I'm not afraid to change things if I think that it's going to
46,00:01:57.50,00:01:57.50,"get me farther in this game. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
47,00:02:00.50,00:02:00.50,Ami confronted Twila about swearing on her son's name and
48,00:02:03.79,00:02:03.79,then breaking their alliance. >> TWILA: I am not the only
49,00:02:07.12,00:02:07.12,friggin' person that has lied in this game.
50,00:02:09.08,00:02:09.08,You've been had. Screw you.
51,00:02:11.25,00:02:11.25,>> But when you bring in the one thing that you say is
52,00:02:13.42,00:02:13.42,"the most sacred thing to you in the world, to me that is not"
53,00:02:15.96,00:02:15.96,worth a million dollars. >> PROBST: And though Eliza
54,00:02:18.04,00:02:18.04,agreed with Ami about Twila's deception...
55,00:02:20.83,00:02:20.83,">> Twila swore on her son, the one thing that someone"
56,00:02:23.21,00:02:23.21,"could say to convince me. I'm, like, ""Oh, well, then"
57,00:02:25.38,00:02:25.38,"they must be true to their word."""
58,00:02:27.50,00:02:27.50,>> PROBST: ...she cast a vote against her big sister.
59,00:02:30.17,00:02:30.17,"Ami, the tribe has spoken. Five are left."
60,00:02:34.54,00:02:34.54,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
61,00:03:53.04,00:03:53.04,>> It's a light night out. >> Incredibly beautiful
62,00:03:57.21,00:03:57.21,"night. >> After Tribal Council, we got"
63,00:03:59.83,00:03:59.83,back to the camp and everything was good.
64,00:04:02.04,00:04:02.04,"Ami was gone, one less worry and I'm the last man standing."
65,00:04:05.38,00:04:05.38,"It seemed like it was going to be just a quiet, you know,"
66,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,"easy-going night, but there was still a lot of emotion stirring"
67,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17,in Twila. The fact that Eliza had brought
68,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,up Twila swearing on her son's name.
69,00:04:18.04,00:04:18.04,">> Sorry, T. >> You don't know how bad"
70,00:04:20.25,00:04:20.25,"I feel about saying that, and then you just keep rubbing salt"
71,00:04:22.92,00:04:22.92,"in the wound, which is fine. >> You know what..."
72,00:04:24.88,00:04:24.88,">> But the only one I want to worry about it with is my son,"
73,00:04:27.62,00:04:27.62,"when I go home. >> We're all dropping it,"
74,00:04:29.50,00:04:29.50,"completely, and I'm sorry I brought it up."
75,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,">> Because I am, you know, I'm sorry I ever"
76,00:04:33.04,00:04:33.04,said it. I am so sorry that I ever made
77,00:04:35.79,00:04:35.79,that statement. I am tired of it.
78,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"I'm tired of hearing about it, period."
79,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,The only one that I've got to condole with or say anything to
80,00:04:43.21,00:04:43.21,is my son when I get home. The rest of you mother ... can
81,00:04:45.38,00:04:45.38,"kiss my ... period. >> Yeah, we're past it"
82,00:04:47.62,00:04:47.62,"and we're over it. >> Yeah, everybody's over it."
83,00:04:50.08,00:04:50.08,>> I think that's a little uncalled for.
84,00:04:51.79,00:04:51.79,>> I was apologizing. I was apologizing.
85,00:04:53.29,00:04:53.29,There's no need to... >> I think it's a lot
86,00:04:55.38,00:04:55.38,"called for, Julie. >> Why?"
87,00:04:57.38,00:04:57.38,>> You all keep ... dogging me about this ... and I'm sick of
88,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,it. >> Your son?
89,00:05:00.50,00:05:00.50,>> So let it go. >> I haven't... your son?
90,00:05:02.62,00:05:02.62,>> Yes. >> I haven't brought up
91,00:05:03.88,00:05:03.88,"your son once. >> Oh, ..."
92,00:05:07.21,00:05:07.21,>> Twila's outburst really looked like a heinous
93,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,insecurity just projected on us. And I'm actually kind of glad
94,00:05:11.58,00:05:11.58,"she did it, 'cause I know it completely turned everybody off"
95,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,and I'm going to use it against her later on.
96,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,That was so uncalled for. >> That was so...
97,00:05:20.21,00:05:20.21,I was apologizing for bringing up something that she
98,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,didn't want me to bring up. >> You know what?
99,00:05:24.04,00:05:24.04,">> And she was like, ""Mother... go to hell."""
100,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,"I'm like, ""Oh, my God."" >> I know."
101,00:05:28.04,00:05:28.04,>> It's shocking. Nobody speaks to me like that.
102,00:05:30.29,00:05:30.29,"Nobody speaks to me like that, and I don't..."
103,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,I don't tolerate it. I guess Twila got a little upset
104,00:05:35.29,00:05:35.29,"at Tribal Council, but she got even more upset when we got"
105,00:05:37.50,00:05:37.50,"back and she was cursing at me. Yes, I brought up the fact that"
106,00:05:41.75,00:05:41.75,"she swore on her son to both me and somebody else, and one of"
107,00:05:46.17,00:05:46.17,"those times it was a lie, so it made me wary of the fact that"
108,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,"she had sworn on her son to me. You know, she's the one who did"
109,00:05:52.71,00:05:52.71,it. If you can't live with your past
110,00:05:54.88,00:05:54.88,"actions, you shouldn't have done it."
111,00:06:10.67,00:06:10.67,(thumping) >> Good morning.
112,00:06:37.96,00:06:37.96,">> Against herself, towards us, more so towards you."
113,00:06:39.92,00:06:39.92,>> Mm-hmm. >> I knew that it wasn't
114,00:06:44.25,00:06:44.25,a good thing what Twila was doing.
115,00:06:46.38,00:06:46.38,She definitely offended Julie. She definitely offended Eliza.
116,00:06:51.04,00:06:51.04,"Eliza being part of this four- person alliance with Scout,"
117,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,"Twila and myself, you know, it's important to try to keep a"
118,00:06:57.25,00:06:57.25,"level, you know, understanding. She's taken a road she doesn't"
119,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,need to take. It's dangerous for her position
120,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,in the game. >> Why would it be a big
121,00:07:05.33,00:07:05.33,deal to vote Twila off instead of me?
122,00:07:09.58,00:07:09.58,">> I don't know. >> Just from your perspective,"
123,00:07:13.54,00:07:13.54,your position. >> I don't know.
124,00:07:18.83,00:07:18.83,>> Yeah. >> I don't think it would.
125,00:07:21.54,00:07:21.54,I would definitely consider making a deal with Julie.
126,00:07:24.54,00:07:24.54,"Sometimes when it's in your best interest to abandon an alliance,"
127,00:07:27.04,00:07:27.04,you have to do that to get yourself further in the game.
128,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,">> Right. I mean, Chris is like either/or,"
129,00:07:37.29,00:07:37.29,"'cause he could win against me. And if anything, Twila's his"
130,00:07:39.96,00:07:39.96,"semi-competition, and I'll talk to him about it."
131,00:07:43.17,00:07:43.17,">> Just say, ""Oh, I mentioned it to Eliza and I told her I"
132,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,"was going to talk to you."" Don't say..."
133,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,">> I'm not gonna... yeah, I'm not saying you're agreeing."
134,00:07:49.58,00:07:49.58,All day I've been shuffling my ideas and my plan to Eliza.
135,00:07:52.12,00:07:52.12,I've been playing up the fact that we want to get rid
136,00:07:54.83,00:07:54.83,of Twila. But her only dilemma is that she
137,00:07:58.08,00:07:58.08,"is going to be faithful to Chris and if Chris doesn't buy it,"
138,00:08:00.96,00:08:00.96,then there's no point. So I have to approach Chris in
139,00:08:03.71,00:08:03.71,"an appropriate time and manner. You know, it's all benching on"
140,00:08:08.21,00:08:08.21,that for me. It could either continue my game
141,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,"or end it abruptly. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
142,00:08:28.88,00:08:28.88,Okay. Today's reward challenge will
143,00:08:31.46,00:08:31.46,give you a second chance with some challenges you have tackled
144,00:08:34.62,00:08:34.62,in the past. All five of you will go through
145,00:08:37.79,00:08:37.79,the mud pit. The first four to get to the
146,00:08:40.21,00:08:40.21,other side move on to the next round.
147,00:08:42.17,00:08:42.17,"Those four will tackle the pigpen, where you must get"
148,00:08:45.00,00:08:45.00,"inside the pigpen, get a pig and get that pig in its cage."
149,00:08:47.71,00:08:47.71,"The first three to do this move on to the next round, where you"
150,00:08:50.92,00:08:50.92,must put together a Tiki puzzle. The first two to correctly solve
151,00:08:54.42,00:08:54.42,the Tiki puzzle move to the final round.
152,00:08:56.42,00:08:56.42,"The last two will race up and across a balance beam, down the"
153,00:08:59.58,00:08:59.58,"other side where, using a slingshot, you must break three"
154,00:09:02.54,00:09:02.54,"tiles. You'll raise a torch, torch will"
155,00:09:04.71,00:09:04.71,"light the wok, you win reward. >> Wow."
156,00:09:06.33,00:09:06.33,>> PROBST: Want to know what you're playing for?
157,00:09:08.25,00:09:08.25,">> Yes. >> PROBST: For the winner, you"
158,00:09:10.54,00:09:10.54,will take a horseback ride. >> Ooh!
159,00:09:12.25,00:09:12.25,>> My favorite. >> PROBST: And you will end up
160,00:09:14.33,00:09:14.33,"at Mount Yasur, one of the most active volcanoes in the world."
161,00:09:18.08,00:09:18.08,"Of course, you'll have a little snack fitting for volcano"
162,00:09:20.62,00:09:20.62,"viewing: hot dogs. >> Oh, my God, Jeff."
163,00:09:23.75,00:09:23.75,>> PROBST: Wine and/or hot chocolate and beer.
164,00:09:26.50,00:09:26.50,You'll spend the night at Mount Yasur.
165,00:09:29.58,00:09:29.58,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
166,00:09:31.12,00:09:31.12,>> PROBST: All right. We're going to draw numbers for
167,00:09:33.12,00:09:33.12,position. We'll get started.
168,00:09:39.54,00:09:39.54,First four through the mud pit move on to the next round.
169,00:09:42.75,00:09:42.75,"Survivors, ready. Go!"
170,00:09:49.92,00:09:49.92,"Chris, Twila, Eliza with a slight lead and then Julie and"
171,00:09:53.92,00:09:53.92,then Scout. Twila and Eliza.
172,00:09:57.21,00:09:57.21,"Chris bringing it on. Julie struggling, but she's"
173,00:10:01.71,00:10:01.71,"still ahead of Scout. First four across, Chris is"
174,00:10:04.50,00:10:04.50,"across, Eliza is across, Twila is across and Julie moving on to"
175,00:10:10.04,00:10:10.04,the next round. Scout is the first one
176,00:10:13.38,00:10:13.38,"eliminated. Here we go, the first three to"
177,00:10:16.33,00:10:16.33,catch a pig that has an orange stripe and get that pig in its
178,00:10:19.58,00:10:19.58,cage moves on to the next round. Survivors ready.
179,00:10:23.04,00:10:23.04,Go! (pigs squealing)
180,00:10:28.67,00:10:28.67,Chris has one. (squealing)
181,00:10:31.50,00:10:31.50,Julie and Eliza fighting for one.
182,00:10:33.83,00:10:33.83,Eliza had it and she lost it. Julie has one.
183,00:10:36.54,00:10:36.54,"Chris is in. >> Go, Twila."
184,00:10:38.71,00:10:38.71,"Go, go, go. >> PROBST: Julie is moving on."
185,00:10:42.04,00:10:42.04,And Twila moving on to the next round.
186,00:10:44.04,00:10:44.04,">> Nice try, honey. >> PROBST: Eliza's out."
187,00:10:46.50,00:10:46.50,First two to correctly get their Tiki put together move on.
188,00:10:50.04,00:10:50.04,"Survivors, ready. Go!"
189,00:10:54.25,00:10:54.25,"Got to untie knots, take the puzzle apart and then put it"
190,00:10:57.71,00:10:57.71,back together again. Chris and Twila wasting no time.
191,00:11:01.17,00:11:01.17,Julie going to untie all her knots first.
192,00:11:03.50,00:11:03.50,"Julie has all the knots undone. Chris has all his pieces off,"
193,00:11:07.75,00:11:07.75,Julie right behind... Twila right behind.
194,00:11:10.29,00:11:10.29,Chris is going to do his on the ground.
195,00:11:12.42,00:11:12.42,First two move on. >> I think I got it.
196,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,>> PROBST: That's not right. Two people are moving on to the
197,00:11:32.25,00:11:32.25,final. >> Please say yes.
198,00:11:34.88,00:11:34.88,>> PROBST: Twila's right. She's moving on.
199,00:11:36.92,00:11:36.92,">> Yes, whoo! >> Way to go, Twila!"
200,00:11:39.79,00:11:39.79,">> PROBST: Chris, trying to figure out where he's"
201,00:11:43.25,00:11:43.25,"gone wrong. Julie's right, moving on."
202,00:11:46.83,00:11:46.83,"Julie and Twila in the final. Chris, one piece over there you"
203,00:11:50.08,00:11:50.08,never used. This piece right here.
204,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,">> No, I didn't see that. >> PROBST: Final two, Twila and"
205,00:11:57.25,00:11:57.25,"Julie, for a horseback ride to Mount Yasur."
206,00:12:00.42,00:12:00.42,"Survivors, ready. Go!"
207,00:12:06.71,00:12:06.71,"Twila trips on the ladder, Julie with a little bit of a lead."
208,00:12:09.04,00:12:09.04,Got to get across this balance beam.
209,00:12:14.08,00:12:14.08,Julie is first over. Twila still doing well on the
210,00:12:20.25,00:12:20.25,beam. Time to catch up.
211,00:12:23.04,00:12:23.04,Julie untying her slingshot. Twila took a big fall on the
212,00:12:29.21,00:12:29.21,"net, she's hurt. Julie untying the slingshot."
213,00:12:37.88,00:12:37.88,Twila making short order of the knot.
214,00:12:39.54,00:12:39.54,"Twila starting to catch up. Julie has her slingshot, got to"
215,00:12:42.25,00:12:42.25,"break three plates, releasing them from the wires."
216,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50,Julie is going to get the first shot in.
217,00:12:47.38,00:12:47.38,"Twila right behind. Julie, with one shot, breaks her"
218,00:12:52.29,00:12:52.29,"first plate. >> Way to go, Julie."
219,00:12:55.54,00:12:55.54,>> PROBST: Julie lines up for her second shot.
220,00:12:57.92,00:12:57.92,Julie breaks her second plate. Twila breaks her first plate.
221,00:13:02.21,00:13:02.21,>> I'm winning this. >> PROBST: Julie says she's
222,00:13:04.00,00:13:04.00,going to win it. She's got one plate left...
223,00:13:06.12,00:13:06.12,and she does. (scattered cheers)
224,00:13:08.92,00:13:08.92,"Julie going to Mount Yasur. >> Way to go, Julie."
225,00:13:13.17,00:13:13.17,">> PROBST: All right, Julie, nice effort."
226,00:13:14.88,00:13:14.88,"You're going to Mount Yasur-- horseback ride, hot dogs, beer."
227,00:13:18.17,00:13:18.17,"Who you taking with you? >> Well, it's ironic, 'cause"
228,00:13:20.46,00:13:20.46,"none of these people would've taken me, so I'm gonna"
229,00:13:24.12,00:13:24.12,take Chris. (groans): Oh... brother.
230,00:13:30.79,00:13:30.79,">> PROBST: All right. You three, nice effort."
231,00:13:33.54,00:13:33.54,Heading back to camp muddy. Head on out.
232,00:13:46.33,00:13:46.33,">> Julie won the reward. And she picked me, and we"
233,00:13:49.17,00:13:49.17,cleaned up after the muddy challenge we went through.
234,00:13:52.71,00:13:52.71,And we journeyed through the jungle and we finally come out
235,00:13:54.96,00:13:54.96,"into this extremely ashy, dense area."
236,00:13:59.62,00:13:59.62,">> Wow. >> Lord, that thing is mammoth."
237,00:14:03.29,00:14:03.29,>> The decision to bring Chris-- I knew none of them were
238,00:14:06.08,00:14:06.08,"going to bring me-- but Chris I had the funnest with, I needed"
239,00:14:11.04,00:14:11.04,"to talk to, and he's my door to open to get me further in this"
240,00:14:14.54,00:14:14.54,"game, so it only made sense to bring Chris."
241,00:14:17.38,00:14:17.38,">> Hello. >> Hello, hello."
242,00:14:21.54,00:14:21.54,>> Julie. >> Joe? Okay.
243,00:14:27.33,00:14:27.33,">> Okay, Joe. >> Let's go."
244,00:14:29.62,00:14:29.62,"Let's take a walk up there. >> Okay, let's go."
245,00:14:35.25,00:14:35.25,">> Oh, yeah! >> Oh, Chris, can you"
246,00:14:37.92,00:14:37.92,believe it? >> This is beautiful.
247,00:14:42.38,00:14:42.38,>> Wow. Wow. Whoa.
248,00:14:46.08,00:14:46.08,Hope you make it. >> He's awful nervous.
249,00:14:54.29,00:14:54.29,">> There was one part when we were crossing the river,"
250,00:14:56.88,00:14:56.88,"okay, and Chris is in the river just looking around."
251,00:14:59.04,00:14:59.04,"And he just looked so hopeless out there, I just couldn't"
252,00:15:01.62,00:15:01.62,help but laugh. >> He's not wanting to go
253,00:15:03.42,00:15:03.42,nowhere. >> Yeah? Just give a kick.
254,00:15:05.42,00:15:05.42,Kick on the side. (clicking tongue)
255,00:15:07.50,00:15:07.50,">> Kick him? >> Kick, yeah."
256,00:15:09.79,00:15:09.79,Stronger. >> This horse and me had
257,00:15:12.04,00:15:12.04,"trouble getting to know each other at first, you know?"
258,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,"It took us a while to, you know, build a trusting relationship."
259,00:15:17.42,00:15:17.42,Go. Whoa!
260,00:15:20.25,00:15:20.25,"So, okay, well, off to a little bit of a rough start on the"
261,00:15:22.88,00:15:22.88,"horse, but everything else went great."
262,00:15:25.25,00:15:25.25,This is beautiful. >> Isn't it?
263,00:15:27.25,00:15:27.25,">> We walked down this long trail, and it was awesome"
264,00:15:30.42,00:15:30.42,just looking at everything on our way up.
265,00:15:47.67,00:15:47.67,">> Finally, we come around the far side of Mount Yasur."
266,00:15:51.92,00:15:51.92,>> Here we are. This is your hut for the night.
267,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,">> Ow! Oh, my God!"
268,00:15:56.96,00:15:56.96,"I see foot-long hot dogs, huge rolls, onions and relish, wine,"
269,00:16:00.92,00:16:00.92,"beer. We are thrilled, so we're like,"
270,00:16:03.54,00:16:03.54,"""Okay, what can we do? Let's get going."""
271,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17,>> Guys... >> Yeah.
272,00:16:12.33,00:16:12.33,"Joe comes back and he's, like, ""Bring the hot dogs."
273,00:16:14.83,00:16:14.83,"We're going to heat them in the vent."""
274,00:16:16.04,00:16:16.04,"You look around, there's all these steam vents coming up."
275,00:16:18.62,00:16:18.62,It was probably about ten feet away.
276,00:16:20.75,00:16:20.75,">> This is nice and warm. >> Oh, wow."
277,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,">> Nice and hot, see? >> Is it hot enough it'll"
278,00:16:26.17,00:16:26.17,cook this? >> Yes. Sure.
279,00:16:27.96,00:16:27.96,>> Great little oven. >> Oh! I'm sorry.
280,00:16:34.33,00:16:34.33,That is hot. >> Yeah.
281,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,"We go over to the vent, and put some corn in the bottom,"
282,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,"and just stick them in. Three minutes later,"
283,00:16:40.08,00:16:40.08,they're ready. >> Okay...
284,00:16:42.04,00:16:42.04,"Oh, yeah, look at that. >> You think?"
285,00:16:43.88,00:16:43.88,>> Yeah. Take a bite. Mine's cooked.
286,00:16:46.38,00:16:46.38,">> We'll leave the corns for... >> God, oh, my God."
287,00:16:49.38,00:16:49.38,"So we doll up our rolls and we ate just four hot dogs nonstop,"
288,00:16:54.67,00:16:54.67,"foot-long, great, yum. I was in heaven."
289,00:16:57.25,00:16:57.25,"Oh, my God, Chris. >> You know, Julie won"
290,00:17:00.12,00:17:00.12,the reward. It didn't surprise me that she
291,00:17:02.42,00:17:02.42,picked me. She wants to go further in the
292,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,"game, and she knows that her name is coming up for"
293,00:17:07.04,00:17:07.04,elimination. >> Are you a lot tighter
294,00:17:09.38,00:17:09.38,with Twila than I thought you were?
295,00:17:11.29,00:17:11.29,">> Um... no, I've never been real tight with Twila."
296,00:17:15.21,00:17:15.21,>> Right. So who do you feel most loyal to?
297,00:17:18.58,00:17:18.58,">> Since the merge, you. You've never done nothing..."
298,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,you've done nothing but help me since then.
299,00:17:23.75,00:17:23.75,I see that. I know that.
300,00:17:25.67,00:17:25.67,"Me and Julie got a little bit of, you know, a bond between us,"
301,00:17:28.96,00:17:28.96,you know. She let me know that she doesn't
302,00:17:30.71,00:17:30.71,want to leave. She wants to stay in the game.
303,00:17:33.00,00:17:33.00,">> Eliza's like, ""I'm aligned with everyone, but Chris"
304,00:17:35.08,00:17:35.08,"is the only one... if you talk to him then I'll consider."""
305,00:17:37.67,00:17:37.67,"She's like, ""I'll go along with it if Chris goes along with it."""
306,00:17:40.29,00:17:40.29,">> Well, that's because she told me I'm the only one"
307,00:17:42.54,00:17:42.54,she trusts now. >> Right.
308,00:17:43.58,00:17:43.58,">> I don't know, Julie worked it pretty good."
309,00:17:45.46,00:17:45.46,There's nothing that Julie or Eliza would like more than for
310,00:17:48.46,00:17:48.46,me to jump on their side and vote off Twila.
311,00:17:51.12,00:17:51.12,And I didn't tell her no. I'm the last guy standing.
312,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,"I sit and I think, ""Is this a bad thing or a good thing?"""
313,00:17:58.46,00:17:58.46,"I just haven't decided yet. Sure, I mean, I know darn well"
314,00:18:02.00,00:18:02.00,you could influence Eliza. >> Yeah.
315,00:18:04.04,00:18:04.04,">> Without a doubt. And, yeah, the three of us could"
316,00:18:07.00,00:18:07.00,completely turn the game around. >> Chris was very open-minded
317,00:18:09.29,00:18:09.29,"and he's open to help me progress in the game, so Chris"
318,00:18:12.50,00:18:12.50,is my rock right now. >> Get them bananas over
319,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,here and just start cutting some of them up and put them in
320,00:18:24.62,00:18:24.62,a soup just so they don't go to waste.
321,00:18:26.71,00:18:26.71,>> You want to bury the other ones?
322,00:18:28.71,00:18:28.71,>> The big ones? >> Yeah. Where are they?
323,00:18:30.54,00:18:30.54,>> Did I unbury them or do you want to bury the
324,00:18:32.58,00:18:32.58,"rest of them? >> No, did you unbury?"
325,00:18:34.17,00:18:34.17,">> Nope, I didn't. >> Where are they?"
326,00:18:36.21,00:18:36.21,>> I'm not telling. >> T...?
327,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,">> If you ask me one more time, I'm going to let the damn"
328,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,things rot in the ground. >> Twila has been telling
329,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,us that she hid these bananas. She buried them in order to help
330,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,them ripen and won't tell us where they are.
331,00:18:51.58,00:18:51.58,">> Are you hungry for a banana, little one?"
332,00:18:53.33,00:18:53.33,">> I'm over the fact that she's saying, ""Oh, we're going"
333,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,"to let them rot in the ground."" It's so patronizing."
334,00:18:59.12,00:18:59.12,">> You're acting like a kid, though. Get over it."
335,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,>> Why are you being so childish about the damn bananas?
336,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,">> She don't want you to have the bananas yet, honey."
337,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,>> Wearing me slick. >> She's saving those
338,00:19:08.12,00:19:08.12,bananas so we all have something to eat at breakfast each
339,00:19:11.08,00:19:11.08,morning. >> I'll just go bury the
340,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,rest of them and then let you know if I decide I want to tell
341,00:19:15.17,00:19:15.17,you where they are. >> Okay.
342,00:19:17.96,00:19:17.96,">> Oh, my God. >> Touch\xc3\xa9."
343,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,"She got you. She got you, Twila."
344,00:19:22.58,00:19:22.58,"(laughing) >> For Scout, for Twila,"
345,00:19:27.33,00:19:27.33,"for me, it's just gotten to the point where we cannot hold back"
346,00:19:31.38,00:19:31.38,anymore and especially Twila. She's just so childish and
347,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,"immature and so obnoxious and annoying, and I hate the way"
348,00:19:39.96,00:19:39.96,she treats me. I hate...
349,00:19:42.17,00:19:42.17,"I mean, oh, my God. >> It just don't make no"
350,00:19:45.29,00:19:45.29,sense why she's being so freakin' childish over it.
351,00:19:48.12,00:19:48.12,I don't care. They can stay in the ground and
352,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,"rot, I ain't digging 'em up now. It's her way or no way."
353,00:19:53.21,00:19:53.21,Forget that. >> I'm so sick of Twila.
354,00:19:57.46,00:19:57.46,"I just want her to go home now. >> Full moon, Chris."
355,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,>> Awesome. >> It's like a challenge
356,00:20:17.08,00:20:17.08,all over again. >> No kidding.
357,00:20:19.79,00:20:19.79,>> It's going to be great. I like watching this.
358,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,">> Oh, wow. >> Do you see?"
359,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,">> Yeah, that is awesome. So Joe comes back and, you know,"
360,00:20:36.21,00:20:36.21,"we're like, okay. He goes, ""Look, I'm going to"
361,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,"take you up here."" So we all three took off up this"
362,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,little trail up the volcano. Watch the rocks.
363,00:20:41.71,00:20:41.71,">> Oh, my God, Chris. >> Oh..."
364,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,">> Oh, my God. Do you believe it?"
365,00:20:49.50,00:20:49.50,>> This is where we're going to sit and watch.
366,00:20:51.96,00:20:51.96,">> No way. Julie, do you see how close we"
367,00:20:54.12,00:20:54.12,are now? >> I know.
368,00:20:59.04,00:20:59.04,"Oh, my God. Gosh."
369,00:21:01.12,00:21:01.12,">> No way. >> Oh, my..."
370,00:21:05.79,00:21:05.79,>> It's like a time bomb. >> It is.
371,00:21:07.83,00:21:07.83,This is definitely like fireworks.
372,00:21:10.25,00:21:10.25,">> It was amazing because every time the volcano erupted,"
373,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,the volcanic rock would shoot out and it just glowed.
374,00:21:15.12,00:21:15.12,"It was like the Fourth of July. Oh, granny, give us a big one."
375,00:21:20.25,00:21:20.25,>> Oh... I saw a volcano exploding the
376,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,whole night. It was one of the most beautiful
377,00:21:27.38,00:21:27.38,things I've ever witnessed. >> There is absolutely no
378,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,other experience in my life I can compare it to.
379,00:21:37.96,00:21:37.96,>> Wow. >> I don't know if I'll
380,00:21:40.38,00:21:40.38,ever have another experience like it.
381,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,"I mean, how often do you get to sit at the mouth of a volcano"
382,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,and watch it explode? Is it talking to us or what?
383,00:21:52.67,00:21:52.67,>> It's saying good-bye. >> Got me scared.
384,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,I had to turn around. >> Just about home.
385,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,">> Oh, I see Chris and Jules coming."
386,00:22:13.75,00:22:13.75,"(animal call) >> Coming, slowpoke?"
387,00:22:17.21,00:22:17.21,">> I just filled your water jug, J.B."
388,00:22:19.96,00:22:19.96,I don't know where yours is or I'd fill it for you.
389,00:22:26.75,00:22:26.75,">> I knew that. I'm glad, yeah."
390,00:22:30.71,00:22:30.71,>> Where's Twila? How is her foot?
391,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"I've been thinking about her. After the reward this morning,"
392,00:22:34.75,00:22:34.75,"we come back to camp. Right away, you know, Scout"
393,00:22:36.96,00:22:36.96,hugged me and she's thinking the same thing I'm thinking.
394,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,It's game time. I just let her know nothing has
395,00:22:44.04,00:22:44.04,changed. We're all four together and
396,00:22:46.08,00:22:46.08,"then, you know, Twila. She's a basket case."
397,00:22:48.33,00:22:48.33,You've got to reassure her. >> Coming back to camp
398,00:22:56.75,00:22:56.75,was perfect. Everything fell together.
399,00:22:58.42,00:22:58.42,"Everyone's thinking on the same terms, keeping an eye on things."
400,00:23:01.42,00:23:01.42,That's what I got to do. >> Come sit and talk to
401,00:23:05.12,00:23:05.12,me for a minute. I was thrilled to get Julie and
402,00:23:08.92,00:23:08.92,Chris back because presumably Julie has spoken to Chris about
403,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,voting for Twila. And if Chris is going to go for
404,00:23:15.58,00:23:15.58,"it, then I might go for it also. >> Everything is good."
405,00:23:19.33,00:23:19.33,Julie picked me for strategy. She's worried about her spot
406,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,in the game. She knows that us four have
407,00:23:25.04,00:23:25.04,"an alliance. >> Right, right."
408,00:23:26.54,00:23:26.54,"So if any one of the four of us wins immunity, we're voting"
409,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,Julie off. >> I don't know.
410,00:23:34.29,00:23:34.29,"Depends on, you know, our best interest in the game and how far"
411,00:23:39.12,00:23:39.12,we can go. I think without a doubt Twila is
412,00:23:42.58,00:23:42.58,"gonna stick with Scout, Scout is gonna stick with Twila."
413,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,">> Oh, yeah, definitely. >> That-that worries me"
414,00:23:48.25,00:23:48.25,a little bit. >> But if Julie stays in
415,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,"the game, we're automatically in the final three."
416,00:23:53.25,00:23:53.25,">> I'm open-minded to exactly what you said, because,"
417,00:23:56.25,00:23:56.25,"you know, me and Julie have talked and we had discussed"
418,00:23:58.75,00:23:58.75,us three... >> Mm-hmm.
419,00:24:00.33,00:24:00.33,>> ...as being better for all three of us.
420,00:24:03.62,00:24:03.62,>> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah.
421,00:24:11.04,00:24:11.04,I sat down with Eliza on the beach.
422,00:24:13.04,00:24:13.04,"We went over a scenario about me, her and Julie taking"
423,00:24:17.00,00:24:17.00,"out Twila. I mean, I don't trust Scout."
424,00:24:19.38,00:24:19.38,I don't trust Twila. I don't trust Eliza.
425,00:24:21.58,00:24:21.58,"I don't trust Julie, and they don't trust each other."
426,00:24:25.88,00:24:25.88,"And the most screwed-up thing about it is, I think they all"
427,00:24:28.62,00:24:28.62,trust me. So... it's... it's getting
428,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,really crazy. I've probably made it this way
429,00:24:35.25,00:24:35.25,myself because I am playing both sides.
430,00:24:38.25,00:24:38.25,Everything's good. We'll just have to see how this
431,00:24:40.25,00:24:40.25,"immunity challenge goes, and, you know, if it falls in the"
432,00:24:43.88,00:24:43.88,"right direction, we'll talk and do what's best for us..."
433,00:24:47.04,00:24:47.04,"to the final three. >> Oh, yeah."
434,00:24:49.75,00:24:49.75,"To the final two. >> Well, yeah, I mean, right."
435,00:24:52.71,00:24:52.71,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Go ahead and have
436,00:25:05.75,00:25:05.75,"a seat, guys. Ready for today's Immunity"
437,00:25:07.38,00:25:07.38,Challenge? >> Mm-hmm.
438,00:25:09.38,00:25:09.38,">> PROBST: First things first, Chris."
439,00:25:11.38,00:25:11.38,Give it up. Immunity back up for grabs.
440,00:25:16.79,00:25:16.79,"For today's immunity challenge, I'm gonna tell you a story about"
441,00:25:19.71,00:25:19.71,"a legendary man in these parts, and then you're gonna have to"
442,00:25:23.17,00:25:23.17,answer a series of questions. Ready for the story?
443,00:25:25.21,00:25:25.21,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, back in"
444,00:25:27.04,00:25:27.04,"the 1200s, this guy Chief Roy Mata comes to this land,"
445,00:25:29.62,00:25:29.62,conquers it. His first goal was to bring
446,00:25:32.54,00:25:32.54,"peace by uniting all of the tribes, and he accomplished"
447,00:25:35.08,00:25:35.08,"that. But sadly, the peace didn't"
448,00:25:37.96,00:25:37.96,"last very long. 15 years later, Roy Mata was"
449,00:25:41.08,00:25:41.08,"murdered, not by an enemy or a rival chief, but by his own"
450,00:25:44.12,00:25:44.12,"brother. Now, it certainly wasn't"
451,00:25:46.21,00:25:46.21,"forbidden to bury a chief on the land that he ruled, but the"
452,00:25:49.88,00:25:49.88,locals were so afraid of the power of the spirit of Roy Mata
453,00:25:53.04,00:25:53.04,that they took the body to a remote location and they buried
454,00:25:56.21,00:25:56.21,"him there with his 18 assistant chiefs, their wives and all of"
455,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,"Roy Mata's wives. Before being buried alive, the"
456,00:26:03.46,00:26:03.46,"men were given a strong brew of kava, not because it was"
457,00:26:07.25,00:26:07.25,customary but because it put them in a dream-like relaxed
458,00:26:10.04,00:26:10.04,"state. The women, however, were"
459,00:26:11.79,00:26:11.79,strangled to death before being buried.
460,00:26:13.67,00:26:13.67,"Once the ceremony was complete, the land was declared taboo, and"
461,00:26:17.42,00:26:17.42,nobody visited for seven centuries.
462,00:26:19.88,00:26:19.88,"One footnote, the name Roy Mata, not a popular name today."
463,00:26:22.54,00:26:22.54,"In fact, it has never been used since."
464,00:26:25.08,00:26:25.08,That is your story. Your challenge now to see how

466,00:26:29.21,00:26:29.21,Here's how it'll work. There are six huts scattered in

472,00:26:44.62,00:26:44.62,"pull one out. If you're wrong, you will grab a"
473,00:26:47.62,00:26:47.62,"black tusk, in which case you have to race back to the center,"
474,00:26:51.38,00:26:51.38,toss it in the urn and return to the hut to answer the question
475,00:26:54.21,00:26:54.21,"correctly. If you're right, you'll grab a"

563,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,Council. >> I know.
564,00:32:45.46,00:32:45.46,">> That's what that means. And so yes, it doesn't affect"
565,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,"our pact, but that means that one of the two of us could end"
566,00:32:50.29,00:32:50.29,"up in the final three with two of them, meaning 100% we do not"
567,00:32:55.00,00:32:55.00,"end up in the final two. >> I know, I know."
568,00:32:59.96,00:32:59.96,">> What's up? >> I don't know, you tell me."
569,00:33:05.62,00:33:05.62,"What's up, Eliza? >> I don't know."
570,00:33:07.04,00:33:07.04,I just feel like you're ... with me.
571,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,">> You got immunity. >> You're right, I do"
572,00:33:10.88,00:33:10.88,"have immunity tonight, but if I don't have immunity tomorrow"
573,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,"night, then who's gone, T? I think you're a liar, T."
574,00:33:15.50,00:33:15.50,>> Who else has been lying? Are you in this alliance with us
575,00:33:19.12,00:33:19.12,to the end? >> I hadn't told a lie in
576,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,this game. >> And have you been
577,00:33:23.21,00:33:23.21,"talking to Julie about anything, or is that just... that's okay"
578,00:33:25.79,00:33:25.79,"for you to do? You said, swore to us that you"
579,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,"was in this final-four alliance till the end, so what've you"
580,00:33:30.12,00:33:30.12,"been talking to Julie about? >> Hey, I'm gonna listen"
581,00:33:32.21,00:33:32.21,"to her. >> And you're not saying,"
582,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,"""Okay, we would like to do this and this and get Twila and Scout"
583,00:33:36.33,00:33:36.33,"out of here"" or anything? >> I'm listening."
584,00:33:38.46,00:33:38.46,"I'm listening, and you know what?"
585,00:33:40.46,00:33:40.46,">> And you ain't said a word? >> I would consider it,"
586,00:33:42.88,00:33:42.88,because you've been trying to plot against me since day one.
587,00:33:44.58,00:33:44.58,>> You've been on the edge for the last three friggin'
588,00:33:46.88,00:33:46.88,days. You're driving everybody
589,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,friggin' nuts. Chill out.
590,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,You got one night that you know you ain't going nowhere.
591,00:33:54.08,00:33:54.08,Enjoy it. >> I will.
592,00:33:56.54,00:33:56.54,">> Now, Chris, what are you thinking?"
593,00:33:58.08,00:33:58.08,">> (laughs): What? I'm just laying here, you know,"
594,00:34:01.88,00:34:01.88,"in the hammock. >> No, you was talking to..."
595,00:34:03.75,00:34:03.75,I just come up. I was just kind of listening to
596,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,what was being said. >> I'm hearing Eliza out.
597,00:34:08.04,00:34:08.04,She's talking to me. >> Okay.
598,00:34:12.25,00:34:12.25,>> Everybody's scrambling. I just think I'm in a better
599,00:34:15.58,00:34:15.58,"position than, you know, Twila, Scout, Eliza, or Julie right now"
600,00:34:19.58,00:34:19.58,"because I'm-I'm, I'm pretty much the middle man, as far as I"
601,00:34:21.96,00:34:21.96,"know. You know, what them four have"
602,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,"conspired or talked about, I don't know."
603,00:34:26.38,00:34:26.38,"I don't trust any of them. They're thick as thieves, man."
604,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,They're all women. How do you trust any of them?
605,00:34:31.71,00:34:31.71,"So, I don't know what I'm going to do."
606,00:34:35.83,00:34:35.83,"I'm messing with both sides, but it's kind of easy to do right"
607,00:34:38.46,00:34:38.46,now. I need to do it to figure out
608,00:34:40.88,00:34:40.88,what my best option is right now.
609,00:34:43.04,00:34:43.04,It's probably in my best interest to go with you and
610,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,Eliza because Scout and Twila are too thick.
611,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,I haven't broke my word that often in this game and I thought
612,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,I would be a cutthroat piece of...
613,00:34:54.21,00:34:54.21,>> But isn't she easier to do that to than me?
614,00:34:56.92,00:34:56.92,>> What I'm comparing this to is my friendship with
615,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,you compared to my friendship with Twila.
616,00:35:01.25,00:35:01.25,>> Right. >> And my friendship with
617,00:35:03.25,00:35:03.25,"you is a hell of a lot more than my-- I mean, come on."
618,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,"We've joked around, and, you know, I call you my little"
619,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,sister. It's just... it's totally
620,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,different. We'll keep you.
621,00:35:10.83,00:35:10.83,We're gonna vote off Twila. >> Chris approaches me.
622,00:35:14.42,00:35:14.42,"He says he's gonna straight-out vote for Twila, basically saying"
623,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,that our friendship is weighing on his decision tonight.
624,00:35:23.42,00:35:23.42,I hope he keeps me around. That's all I can do.
625,00:35:25.79,00:35:25.79,I don't know for sure. I'm not going to be extremely
626,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,paranoid. I'm just really gonna be even
627,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,keel and hope that it goes in my favor.
628,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,>> I haven't liked the game since we merged.
629,00:35:36.04,00:35:36.04,>> We have no reason to be stressed.
630,00:35:38.08,00:35:38.08,I've made my decision. It's not gonna change.
631,00:35:40.79,00:35:40.79,"It's me, you, and Scout voting for Julie, and that's it."
632,00:35:44.67,00:35:44.67,That's not gonna change. I'm not even hesitating.
633,00:35:48.12,00:35:48.12,Me and Julie's become friends. I'm sending her home tonight.
634,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,>> Chris has guaranteed me that I'm not going home
635,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,tonight. Part of me wants to believe
636,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,"Chris wholeheartedly, but-- it's a game."
637,00:35:59.96,00:35:59.96,I just cannot do it. I cannot let my guard down.
638,00:36:02.62,00:36:02.62,You can't trust nobody now. Nobody.
639,00:36:04.58,00:36:04.58,You're playing for a million dollars.
640,00:36:06.58,00:36:06.58,"People have murdered for less than a million dollars,"
641,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,you know? Come on.
642,00:36:15.25,00:36:15.25,">> I'm excited to have immunity. >> I know, you ought to be."
643,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,>> I told Julie that I'm keeping her.
644,00:36:22.92,00:36:22.92,I told Twila that I'm keeping her.
645,00:36:25.25,00:36:25.25,I'm gonna put myself in the best possible situation to win the
646,00:36:29.04,00:36:29.04,game. It's tough right now.
647,00:36:32.58,00:36:32.58,I'm gonna have to make a decision before long.
648,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of the jury: Sarge,"
649,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,"Chad, Leanne, and Ami-- voted out at the last Tribal Council."
650,00:37:03.38,00:37:03.38,"Welcome to Tribal Council. Well, let talk about 36 days, a"
651,00:37:08.00,00:37:08.00,"lot of wear and tear, physically and certainly emotionally."
652,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,Everybody here wants to win the game.
653,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,Have you guys started thinking about who deserves to win this
654,00:37:15.92,00:37:15.92,"game? Twila, is there any way that"
655,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,somebody could be unworthy of winning?
656,00:37:22.17,00:37:22.17,>> I don't know. >> Be honest.
657,00:37:25.71,00:37:25.71,>> PROBST: You don't know or you don't want to say?
658,00:37:28.79,00:37:28.79,">> You are being hard on me, you know that?"
659,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,">> PROBST: Am I? >> Yes, sir, you are."
660,00:37:32.92,00:37:32.92,>> PROBST: Are you saying there are people here tonight that
661,00:37:34.71,00:37:34.71,absolutely do not deserve to be in the final five.
662,00:37:40.83,00:37:40.83,">> Just tell him what you feel, Twila."
663,00:37:42.96,00:37:42.96,">> Yeah, come on. >> Why hold back now?"
664,00:37:45.42,00:37:45.42,">> My personal opinion is yes, there is."
665,00:37:50.25,00:37:50.25,">> It's me, by the way, in case anybody was wondering."
666,00:37:52.96,00:37:52.96,">> PROBST: Well, Twila, it's no secret you and Eliza have not"
667,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,"gotten along for a long time. >> No. No, there's no secret."
668,00:37:58.54,00:37:58.54,">> PROBST: Eliza, anybody here that doesn't deserve to be here."
669,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,">> Even though they would say the opposite of me, I think"
670,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,all the people sitting here deserve to be here.
671,00:38:05.62,00:38:05.62,That doesn't mean that I like them.
672,00:38:07.58,00:38:07.58,"That doesn't mean that I don't like other people, who are no"
673,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"longer in the game, a million times more than I like some of"
674,00:38:14.21,00:38:14.21,"the people sitting here next to me, but I think we all deserve"
675,00:38:17.21,00:38:17.21,to be here. We wouldn't be here otherwise.
676,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,">> PROBST: What about you, Julie?"
677,00:38:20.75,00:38:20.75,"At this point, when you have to vote, obviously, it's strategic,"
678,00:38:22.92,00:38:22.92,"but is there any part of you starting to whittle things down,"
679,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,thinking who I want to go to the final four with are these people
680,00:38:28.46,00:38:28.46,"and this is why? >> Um... I guess, just"
681,00:38:30.79,00:38:30.79,"judging people. The longer you're with them, you"
682,00:38:33.54,00:38:33.54,"see their antics and tactics and I feel like I can, I know who I"
683,00:38:36.92,00:38:36.92,can trust and who I can't trust and who cares about me or who
684,00:38:39.79,00:38:39.79,"doesn't care about me. >> PROBST: At this point, do you"
685,00:38:42.25,00:38:42.25,think any of these other four care about you?
686,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,">> Yeah, I know that some do. >> PROBST: Chris, what's tough"
687,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,for you about tonight's vote? >> Toughest vote yet.
688,00:38:51.96,00:38:51.96,">> PROBST: For you? >> Oh, yeah."
689,00:38:53.92,00:38:53.92,>> PROBST: Why? >> Uh... kind of caught
690,00:38:55.88,00:38:55.88,in the middle. It's a vote I don't even want to
691,00:38:58.12,00:38:58.12,"cast, but I, you know, I've got to play the game."
692,00:39:01.67,00:39:01.67,">> PROBST: All right. Eliza, you have immunity."
693,00:39:04.25,00:39:04.25,"As always, you can keep it or assign it to somebody else."

695,00:39:08.75,00:39:08.75,">> Oh, give it to Twila. >> It's my first time."
696,00:39:10.79,00:39:10.79,">> PROBST: Okay, you cannot vote for Eliza."
697,00:39:12.71,00:39:12.71,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.

699,00:39:25.71,00:39:25.71,"gave me some good information: ""Go back to your roots, Jules."
700,00:39:30.17,00:39:30.17,"Rediscover your roots."" >> Twila, I have been"
701,00:39:47.08,00:39:47.08,waiting to vote you off since the day I met you.
702,00:39:50.25,00:39:50.25,"I cannot believe that 36 days later, I'm finally getting"
703,00:39:54.25,00:39:54.25,"this opportunity. >> It's tough, but I"
704,00:40:13.83,00:40:13.83,gotta play the game. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
705,00:40:22.25,00:40:22.25,votes. >> PROBST: Once the votes are

708,00:40:40.00,00:40:40.00,I'll read the votes. First vote... Julie.
709,00:40:50.17,00:40:50.17,"Twila. One vote Julie, one vote Twila."
710,00:40:55.92,00:40:55.92,"Julie. Two votes Julie, one vote Twila."
711,00:41:02.50,00:41:02.50,"Twila. Two votes Twila, two votes"
712,00:41:06.00,00:41:06.00,Julie. I'll read the last vote.
713,00:41:10.79,00:41:10.79,The 14th person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu...
714,00:41:15.62,00:41:15.62,Julie. You need to bring me your torch.

719,00:41:54.42,00:41:54.42,to camp. Good night.
720,00:42:09.79,00:42:09.79,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

730,00:42:43.50,00:42:43.50,"Little bit of a surprise. You know, I-I thought Chris and"
731,00:42:46.17,00:42:46.17,I had this kind of straightforward brother-sister
732,00:42:48.58,00:42:48.58,"kind of slap-each-other-around relationship, and Chris was kind"
733,00:42:52.25,00:42:52.25,of my crutch today and he told me 100% that he was gonna vote
734,00:42:54.92,00:42:54.92,for Twila. I don't know if he changed the
735,00:42:56.50,00:42:56.50,last minute. I'm curious.
