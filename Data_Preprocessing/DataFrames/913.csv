48,00:02:07.12,00:02:07.12,friggin' person that has lied inthis game.

54,00:02:20.83,00:02:20.83,">> Twila swore on her son,the one thing that someone"
55,00:02:23.21,00:02:23.21,"could say to convince me.I'm, like, ""Oh, well, then"
56,00:02:25.38,00:02:25.38,"they must be true to theirword."""
57,00:02:27.50,00:02:27.50,>> PROBST: ...she cast a voteagainst her big sister.

64,00:04:05.38,00:04:05.38,"It seemed like it was goingto be just a quiet, you know,"
65,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,"easy-going night, but there wasstill a lot of emotion stirring"
66,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17,in Twila.The fact that Eliza had brought
67,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,up Twila swearing on her son'sname.
68,00:04:18.04,00:04:18.04,">> Sorry, T.>> You don't know how bad"

72,00:04:27.62,00:04:27.62,"when I go home.>> We're all dropping it,"
73,00:04:29.50,00:04:29.50,"completely, and I'm sorryI brought it up."
74,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,">> Because I am, youknow, I'm sorry I ever"
75,00:04:33.04,00:04:33.04,said it.I am so sorry that I ever made
76,00:04:35.79,00:04:35.79,that statement.I am tired of it.
77,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"I'm tired of hearing about it,period."
78,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,The only one that I've got tocondole with or say anything to
79,00:04:43.21,00:04:43.21,is my son when I get home.The rest of you mother ... can
80,00:04:45.38,00:04:45.38,"kiss my ... period.>> Yeah, we're past it"
81,00:04:47.62,00:04:47.62,"and we're over it.>> Yeah, everybody's over it."
82,00:04:50.08,00:04:50.08,>> I think that's a littleuncalled for.

84,00:04:53.29,00:04:53.29,There's no need to...>> I think it's a lot
85,00:04:55.38,00:04:55.38,"called for, Julie.>> Why?"
86,00:04:57.38,00:04:57.38,>> You all keep ... dogging meabout this ... and I'm sick of
87,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,it.>> Your son?
88,00:05:00.50,00:05:00.50,>> So let it go.>> I haven't... your son?
89,00:05:02.62,00:05:02.62,>> Yes.>> I haven't brought up
90,00:05:03.88,00:05:03.88,"your son once.>> Oh, ..."
91,00:05:07.21,00:05:07.21,>> Twila's outburst reallylooked like a heinous
92,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,insecurity just projected on us.And I'm actually kind of glad
93,00:05:11.58,00:05:11.58,"she did it, 'cause I know itcompletely turned everybody off"
94,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,and I'm going to use it againsther later on.
95,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,That was so uncalled for.>> That was so...
96,00:05:20.21,00:05:20.21,I was apologizing forbringing up something that she
97,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,didn't want me to bring up.>> You know what?
98,00:05:24.04,00:05:24.04,">> And she was like,""Mother... go to hell."""
99,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,"I'm like, ""Oh, my God."">> I know."
100,00:05:28.04,00:05:28.04,>> It's shocking.Nobody speaks to me like that.
101,00:05:30.29,00:05:30.29,"Nobody speaks to me like that,and I don't..."
102,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,I don't tolerate it.I guess Twila got a little upset
103,00:05:35.29,00:05:35.29,"at Tribal Council, but she goteven more upset when we got"
104,00:05:37.50,00:05:37.50,"back and she was cursing at me.Yes, I brought up the fact that"
105,00:05:41.75,00:05:41.75,"she swore on her son to both meand somebody else, and one of"
106,00:05:46.17,00:05:46.17,"those times it was a lie, so itmade me wary of the fact that"
107,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,"she had sworn on her son to me.You know, she's the one who did"
108,00:05:52.71,00:05:52.71,it.If you can't live with your past
109,00:05:54.88,00:05:54.88,"actions, you shouldn't have doneit."
110,00:06:10.67,00:06:10.67,(thumping)>> Good morning.
111,00:06:37.96,00:06:37.96,">> Against herself,towards us, more so towards you."
112,00:06:39.92,00:06:39.92,>> Mm-hmm.>> I knew that it wasn't
113,00:06:44.25,00:06:44.25,a good thing what Twila wasdoing.
114,00:06:46.38,00:06:46.38,She definitely offended Julie.She definitely offended Eliza.
115,00:06:51.04,00:06:51.04,"Eliza being part of this four-person alliance with Scout,"
116,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,"Twila and myself, you know, it'simportant to try to keep a"
117,00:06:57.25,00:06:57.25,"level, you know, understanding.She's taken a road she doesn't"
118,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,need to take.It's dangerous for her position
119,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,in the game.>> Why would it be a big
120,00:07:05.33,00:07:05.33,deal to vote Twila off insteadof me?
121,00:07:09.58,00:07:09.58,">> I don't know.>> Just from your perspective,"
122,00:07:13.54,00:07:13.54,your position.>> I don't know.
123,00:07:18.83,00:07:18.83,>> Yeah.>> I don't think it would.
124,00:07:21.54,00:07:21.54,I would definitely considermaking a deal with Julie.
125,00:07:24.54,00:07:24.54,"Sometimes when it's in your bestinterest to abandon an alliance,"
126,00:07:27.04,00:07:27.04,you have to do that to getyourself further in the game.
127,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,">> Right.I mean, Chris is like either/or,"
128,00:07:37.29,00:07:37.29,"'cause he could win against me.And if anything, Twila's his"
129,00:07:39.96,00:07:39.96,"semi-competition, and I'll talkto him about it."
130,00:07:43.17,00:07:43.17,">> Just say, ""Oh, I mentionedit to Eliza and I told her I"
131,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,"was going to talk to you.""Don't say..."
132,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,">> I'm not gonna... yeah,I'm not saying you're agreeing."
133,00:07:49.58,00:07:49.58,All day I've been shuffling myideas and my plan to Eliza.
134,00:07:52.12,00:07:52.12,I've been playing up the factthat we want to get rid
135,00:07:54.83,00:07:54.83,of Twila.But her only dilemma is that she
136,00:07:58.08,00:07:58.08,"is going to be faithful to Chrisand if Chris doesn't buy it,"
137,00:08:00.96,00:08:00.96,then there's no point.So I have to approach Chris in
138,00:08:03.71,00:08:03.71,"an appropriate time and manner.You know, it's all benching on"
139,00:08:08.21,00:08:08.21,that for me.It could either continue my game
140,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,"or end it abruptly.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

256,00:15:12.04,00:15:12.04,"trouble getting to know eachother at first, you know?"
257,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,"It took us a while to, you know,build a trusting relationship."
258,00:15:17.42,00:15:17.42,Go.Whoa!

274,00:16:18.62,00:16:18.62,It was probably about ten feetaway.
275,00:16:20.75,00:16:20.75,">> This is nice and warm.>> Oh, wow."
276,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,">> Nice and hot, see?>> Is it hot enough it'll"

280,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,"We go over to the vent,and put some corn in the bottom,"
281,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,"and just stick them in.Three minutes later,"
282,00:16:40.08,00:16:40.08,they're ready.>> Okay...
283,00:16:42.04,00:16:42.04,"Oh, yeah, look at that.>> You think?"

288,00:16:57.25,00:16:57.25,"Oh, my God, Chris.>> You know, Julie won"
289,00:17:00.12,00:17:00.12,the reward.It didn't surprise me that she
290,00:17:02.42,00:17:02.42,picked me.She wants to go further in the
291,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,"game, and she knows that hername is coming up for"
292,00:17:07.04,00:17:07.04,elimination.>> Are you a lot tighter
293,00:17:09.38,00:17:09.38,with Twila than I thoughtyou were?
294,00:17:11.29,00:17:11.29,">> Um... no, I've neverbeen real tight with Twila."
295,00:17:15.21,00:17:15.21,>> Right. So who do youfeel most loyal to?
296,00:17:18.58,00:17:18.58,">> Since the merge, you.You've never done nothing..."
297,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,you've done nothing but help mesince then.
298,00:17:23.75,00:17:23.75,I see that.I know that.
299,00:17:25.67,00:17:25.67,"Me and Julie got a little bitof, you know, a bond between us,"
300,00:17:28.96,00:17:28.96,you know.She let me know that she doesn't
301,00:17:30.71,00:17:30.71,want to leave.She wants to stay in the game.
302,00:17:33.00,00:17:33.00,">> Eliza's like, ""I'maligned with everyone, but Chris"
303,00:17:35.08,00:17:35.08,"is the only one... if you talkto him then I'll consider."""
304,00:17:37.67,00:17:37.67,"She's like, ""I'll go along withit if Chris goes along with it."""
305,00:17:40.29,00:17:40.29,">> Well, that's becauseshe told me I'm the only one"
306,00:17:42.54,00:17:42.54,she trusts now.>> Right.

308,00:17:45.46,00:17:45.46,There's nothing that Julie orEliza would like more than for
309,00:17:48.46,00:17:48.46,me to jump on their side andvote off Twila.
310,00:17:51.12,00:17:51.12,And I didn't tell her no.I'm the last guy standing.
311,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,"I sit and I think, ""Is this abad thing or a good thing?"""
312,00:17:58.46,00:17:58.46,"I just haven't decided yet.Sure, I mean, I know darn well"
313,00:18:02.00,00:18:02.00,you could influence Eliza.>> Yeah.
314,00:18:04.04,00:18:04.04,">> Without a doubt.And, yeah, the three of us could"
315,00:18:07.00,00:18:07.00,completely turn the game around.>> Chris was very open-minded
316,00:18:09.29,00:18:09.29,"and he's open to help meprogress in the game, so Chris"
317,00:18:12.50,00:18:12.50,is my rock right now.>> Get them bananas over
318,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,here and just start cuttingsome of them up and put them in
319,00:18:24.62,00:18:24.62,a soup just so they don'tgo to waste.
320,00:18:26.71,00:18:26.71,>> You want to bury theother ones?
321,00:18:28.71,00:18:28.71,>> The big ones?>> Yeah. Where are they?
322,00:18:30.54,00:18:30.54,>> Did I unbury them ordo you want to bury the
323,00:18:32.58,00:18:32.58,"rest of them?>> No, did you unbury?"
324,00:18:34.17,00:18:34.17,">> Nope, I didn't.>> Where are they?"
325,00:18:36.21,00:18:36.21,>> I'm not telling.>> T...?
326,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,">> If you ask me one moretime, I'm going to let the damn"
327,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,things rot in the ground.>> Twila has been telling
328,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,us that she hid these bananas.She buried them in order to help
329,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,them ripen and won't tell uswhere they are.
330,00:18:51.58,00:18:51.58,">> Are you hungry for abanana, little one?"
331,00:18:53.33,00:18:53.33,">> I'm over the fact thatshe's saying, ""Oh, we're going"
332,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,"to let them rot in the ground.""It's so patronizing."
333,00:18:59.12,00:18:59.12,">> You're acting like akid, though. Get over it."
334,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,>> Why are you being sochildish about the damn bananas?
335,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,">> She don't want you tohave the bananas yet, honey."
336,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,>> Wearing me slick.>> She's saving those
337,00:19:08.12,00:19:08.12,bananas so we all have somethingto eat at breakfast each
338,00:19:11.08,00:19:11.08,morning.>> I'll just go bury the
339,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,rest of them and then let youknow if I decide I want to tell
340,00:19:15.17,00:19:15.17,you where they are.>> Okay.
341,00:19:17.96,00:19:17.96,">> Oh, my God.>> Touché."
342,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,"She got you.She got you, Twila."
343,00:19:22.58,00:19:22.58,"(laughing)>> For Scout, for Twila,"
344,00:19:27.33,00:19:27.33,"for me, it's just gotten to thepoint where we cannot hold back"
345,00:19:31.38,00:19:31.38,anymore and especially Twila.She's just so childish and
346,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,"immature and so obnoxious andannoying, and I hate the way"
347,00:19:39.96,00:19:39.96,she treats me.I hate...
348,00:19:42.17,00:19:42.17,"I mean, oh, my God.>> It just don't make no"
349,00:19:45.29,00:19:45.29,sense why she's being sofreakin' childish over it.
350,00:19:48.12,00:19:48.12,I don't care.They can stay in the ground and
351,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,"rot, I ain't digging 'em up now.It's her way or no way."
352,00:19:53.21,00:19:53.21,Forget that.>> I'm so sick of Twila.
353,00:19:57.46,00:19:57.46,"I just want her to go home now.>> Full moon, Chris."
354,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,>> Awesome.>> It's like a challenge
355,00:20:17.08,00:20:17.08,all over again.>> No kidding.
356,00:20:19.79,00:20:19.79,>> It's going to be great.I like watching this.
357,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,">> Oh, wow.>> Do you see?"
358,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,">> Yeah, that is awesome.So Joe comes back and, you know,"
359,00:20:36.21,00:20:36.21,"we're like, okay.He goes, ""Look, I'm going to"
360,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,"take you up here.""So we all three took off up this"
361,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,little trail up the volcano.Watch the rocks.
362,00:20:41.71,00:20:41.71,">> Oh, my God, Chris.>> Oh..."
363,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,">> Oh, my God.Do you believe it?"
364,00:20:49.50,00:20:49.50,>> This is where we'regoing to sit and watch.
365,00:20:51.96,00:20:51.96,">> No way.Julie, do you see how close we"
366,00:20:54.12,00:20:54.12,are now?>> I know.
367,00:20:59.04,00:20:59.04,"Oh, my God.Gosh."

369,00:21:05.79,00:21:05.79,>> It's like a time bomb.>> It is.
370,00:21:07.83,00:21:07.83,This is definitely likefireworks.
371,00:21:10.25,00:21:10.25,">> It was amazing becauseevery time the volcano erupted,"
372,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,the volcanic rock would shootout and it just glowed.
373,00:21:15.12,00:21:15.12,"It was like the Fourth of July.Oh, granny, give us a big one."

375,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,whole night.It was one of the most beautiful
376,00:21:27.38,00:21:27.38,things I've ever witnessed.>> There is absolutely no
377,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,other experience in my life Ican compare it to.

379,00:21:40.38,00:21:40.38,ever have another experiencelike it.
380,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,"I mean, how often do you get tosit at the mouth of a volcano"
381,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,and watch it explode?Is it talking to us or what?
382,00:21:52.67,00:21:52.67,>> It's saying good-bye.>> Got me scared.
383,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,I had to turn around.>> Just about home.
384,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,">> Oh, I see Chris andJules coming."
385,00:22:13.75,00:22:13.75,"(animal call)>> Coming, slowpoke?"

389,00:22:30.71,00:22:30.71,>> Where's Twila?How is her foot?
390,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"I've been thinking about her.After the reward this morning,"
391,00:22:34.75,00:22:34.75,"we come back to camp.Right away, you know, Scout"
392,00:22:36.96,00:22:36.96,hugged me and she's thinking thesame thing I'm thinking.
393,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,It's game time.I just let her know nothing has
394,00:22:44.04,00:22:44.04,changed.We're all four together and
395,00:22:46.08,00:22:46.08,"then, you know, Twila.She's a basket case."
396,00:22:48.33,00:22:48.33,You've got to reassure her.>> Coming back to camp
397,00:22:56.75,00:22:56.75,was perfect.Everything fell together.
398,00:22:58.42,00:22:58.42,"Everyone's thinking on the sameterms, keeping an eye on things."
399,00:23:01.42,00:23:01.42,That's what I got to do.>> Come sit and talk to
400,00:23:05.12,00:23:05.12,me for a minute.I was thrilled to get Julie and
401,00:23:08.92,00:23:08.92,Chris back because presumablyJulie has spoken to Chris about
402,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,voting for Twila.And if Chris is going to go for
403,00:23:15.58,00:23:15.58,"it, then I might go for it also.>> Everything is good."
404,00:23:19.33,00:23:19.33,Julie picked me for strategy.She's worried about her spot
405,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,in the game.She knows that us four have
406,00:23:25.04,00:23:25.04,"an alliance.>> Right, right."
407,00:23:26.54,00:23:26.54,"So if any one of the four of uswins immunity, we're voting"
408,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,Julie off.>> I don't know.
409,00:23:34.29,00:23:34.29,"Depends on, you know, our bestinterest in the game and how far"
410,00:23:39.12,00:23:39.12,we can go.I think without a doubt Twila is
411,00:23:42.58,00:23:42.58,"gonna stick with Scout, Scout isgonna stick with Twila."
412,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,">> Oh, yeah, definitely.>> That-that worries me"
413,00:23:48.25,00:23:48.25,a little bit.>> But if Julie stays in
414,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,"the game, we're automatically inthe final three."
415,00:23:53.25,00:23:53.25,">> I'm open-minded toexactly what you said, because,"
416,00:23:56.25,00:23:56.25,"you know, me and Julie havetalked and we had discussed"
417,00:23:58.75,00:23:58.75,us three...>> Mm-hmm.
418,00:24:00.33,00:24:00.33,>> ...as being better forall three of us.
419,00:24:03.62,00:24:03.62,>> Mm-hmm.>> Yeah.
420,00:24:11.04,00:24:11.04,I sat down with Eliza on thebeach.
421,00:24:13.04,00:24:13.04,"We went over a scenario aboutme, her and Julie taking"
422,00:24:17.00,00:24:17.00,"out Twila.I mean, I don't trust Scout."
423,00:24:19.38,00:24:19.38,I don't trust Twila.I don't trust Eliza.
424,00:24:21.58,00:24:21.58,"I don't trust Julie, andthey don't trust each other."
425,00:24:25.88,00:24:25.88,"And the most screwed-up thingabout it is, I think they all"
426,00:24:28.62,00:24:28.62,trust me.So... it's... it's getting
427,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,really crazy.I've probably made it this way
428,00:24:35.25,00:24:35.25,myself because I am playingboth sides.
429,00:24:38.25,00:24:38.25,Everything's good.We'll just have to see how this
430,00:24:40.25,00:24:40.25,"immunity challenge goes, and,you know, if it falls in the"
431,00:24:43.88,00:24:43.88,"right direction, we'll talk anddo what's best for us..."
432,00:24:47.04,00:24:47.04,"to the final three.>> Oh, yeah."
433,00:24:49.75,00:24:49.75,"To the final two.>> Well, yeah, I mean, right."

609,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,Eliza because Scout and Twilaare too thick.
610,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,I haven't broke my word thatoften in this game and I thought
611,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,I would be a cutthroat pieceof...
