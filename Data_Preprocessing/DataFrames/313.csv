410,00:21:01.57,00:21:01.57,"checking out the hospital,talking to the doctors,"
411,00:21:03.77,00:21:03.77,"seeing all of thisstuff face-to-face,"
412,00:21:05.07,00:21:05.07,I walked away achanged person.
413,00:21:07.40,00:21:07.40,"Doctor, it was a greatpleasure, thank you again."
414,00:21:09.33,00:21:09.33,- The pleasure was mine.
415,00:21:15.50,00:21:15.50,See you.
416,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,- The gift I take away from hereis he's planted a small seed
417,00:21:19.77,00:21:19.77,in me and I'm going totake that home with me.
418,00:21:34.73,00:21:34.73,- Today there's alittle bit of animosity
419,00:21:36.67,00:21:36.67,towards Lex on winningthat truck.
420,00:21:39.07,00:21:39.07,I had a lot of peopleasking me about my alliance
421,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,and trying to change things.
422,00:21:47.07,00:21:47.07,"The second thing,the three of us had alliance"
423,00:21:48.93,00:21:48.93,"and then, they never told menobody else was in it."
424,00:21:51.07,00:21:51.07,- Right.- Anybody that was good--
425,00:21:53.47,00:21:53.47,"was good to me, I've triedto take care of 'em."
426,00:21:55.80,00:21:55.80,And I've tried to usemy personal judgment
427,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,on how far I thoughtthey ought to go.
428,00:22:02.10,00:22:02.10,- (whispering) We don'twant to get this far
429,00:22:04.23,00:22:04.23,and have it beLex and Tommy.
430,00:22:08.23,00:22:08.23,"I mean, you've come too farto have that happen to you."
431,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,I'm absolutelytrying to work a deal.
432,00:22:13.27,00:22:13.27,"You guys get rid of me, okay,there's the three of you."
433,00:22:15.43,00:22:15.43,"With that in mind,I know all these guys"
434,00:22:17.60,00:22:17.60,don't really want to come downto the threesome.
435,00:22:19.50,00:22:19.50,They're allskeptical of each other.
436,00:22:21.87,00:22:21.87,"My dilemma then, at this point,with my immunity at stake,"
437,00:22:26.10,00:22:26.10,is to figure outwhich of the guys
438,00:22:28.83,00:22:28.83,is feeling the mostvulnerable.
439,00:22:30.63,00:22:30.63,Which one is the bestone to try to approach
440,00:22:33.40,00:22:33.40,with some type of scenario.
441,00:22:36.07,00:22:36.07,(whispering) If you don'teliminate one of those two
442,00:22:38.43,00:22:38.43,"tomorrow, you have to eliminateone of those two the next time."
443,00:22:41.73,00:22:41.73,"- Yeah, I know that.- And you have to decide."
444,00:22:44.10,00:22:44.10,"- Today, Kim approached meand she's like,"
445,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,"""You got to get Lex off."""
446,00:22:48.30,00:22:48.30,"She's like,""If you don't get Lex off,"
447,00:22:49.40,00:22:49.40,"you're shooting yourselfin the foot."""
448,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,- Hello.
449,00:22:54.80,00:22:54.80,- We thought maybeyou had gone out
450,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17,for steak dinner in addition.
451,00:22:57.70,00:22:57.70,"- No, no.- No such luck?"
452,00:22:59.73,00:22:59.73,- I was gone most of the day.
453,00:23:01.17,00:23:01.17,"When I got back, the vibewas thick at camp."
454,00:23:04.67,00:23:04.67,- How was it?- So pull up a chair.
455,00:23:06.17,00:23:06.17,- It was heavy.
456,00:23:07.73,00:23:07.73,It was really heavy.
457,00:23:09.73,00:23:09.73,And so we...
458,00:23:12.93,00:23:12.93,Everyone else in the tribewas bummed about the fact
459,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,that they lostand didn't win.
460,00:23:16.73,00:23:16.73,"They've got patients fromEthiopia, Somalia, Mogadishu."
461,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63,"Everyone was nervous,"
462,00:23:22.00,00:23:22.00,and no one really wantedto talk about anything.
463,00:23:24.37,00:23:24.37,"So, anyway, we got there andthere's this old doctor there."
464,00:23:28.27,00:23:28.27,There was some strangestuff going down.
465,00:23:30.80,00:23:30.80,The mojo was just funky.
466,00:23:37.60,00:23:37.60,"- He's healthy, he's beeneating normally."
467,00:23:40.23,00:23:40.23,He's been out of the campfive more days than I have.
468,00:23:42.77,00:23:42.77,"You know, he's ridingon confidence."
469,00:23:45.47,00:23:45.47,It's tough to be atthe top of your game
470,00:23:47.97,00:23:47.97,when someone elsehas all that--
471,00:23:49.20,00:23:49.20,all thoseadded ingredients.
472,00:23:50.97,00:23:50.97,- (whispering) I wouldabsolutely not say the mood
473,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,around here wasall pissed off.
474,00:23:53.83,00:23:53.83,"If anything,it was like,"
475,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,"you know, here we are--just jealousy."
476,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,- It just gets hard notto feel very vulnerable.
477,00:24:01.27,00:24:01.27,"- Good morning, Tommy."
478,00:24:02.70,00:24:02.70,(Tom muttering)
479,00:24:05.23,00:24:05.23,- Tommy on several occasionshas tried to get Lex voted off.
480,00:24:09.53,00:24:09.53,"He actually told Teresa that Lexshould be the next one to go,"
481,00:24:13.67,00:24:13.67,unbeknownst to Lex or Ethan.
482,00:24:16.40,00:24:16.40,"And he came to me and saidthat if I have an opportunity,"
483,00:24:21.53,00:24:21.53,"it would be a good thingto vote off Lex,"
484,00:24:22.93,00:24:22.93,but he didn't want toknow anything about it.
485,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,- You know what?
486,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37,- What?
487,00:24:36.57,00:24:36.57,"- We made an alliance,we got to stick with it."
488,00:24:39.80,00:24:39.80,"What will be, will be."
489,00:24:42.37,00:24:42.37,And I don't knowno other way.
490,00:24:45.30,00:24:45.30,"- Well, the other way is whatwe said-- we get Lex off."
491,00:24:48.53,00:24:48.53,- He's going to behard to beat in immunity.
492,00:24:50.43,00:24:50.43,"- Oh, yeah.- 'Cause he's strong."
493,00:24:53.50,00:24:53.50,"- I mean, doesn't the thoughtof him winning again"
494,00:24:55.27,00:24:55.27,piss you off?
495,00:24:57.17,00:24:57.17,I came into this game withthe attitude of winning
496,00:25:01.10,00:25:01.10,"the whole thing,and to do it in a fair way"
497,00:25:04.73,00:25:04.73,and to do it beatingthe best people
498,00:25:07.27,00:25:07.27,and going againstthe best head-to-head.
499,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,"- (whispering) Until today, Idon't think either of them"
500,00:25:15.70,00:25:15.70,realized how muchof a threat he was.
501,00:25:18.23,00:25:18.23,Ethan included.
502,00:25:19.33,00:25:19.33,"Ethan's like,pissed now, you know?"
503,00:25:20.90,00:25:20.90,"- All of you want him gone,but nobody wants to do it."
504,00:25:23.80,00:25:23.80,Kim said today thatshe knows that the guys
505,00:25:27.33,00:25:27.33,"have got such a strong alliance,that she is the next to go."
506,00:25:29.43,00:25:29.43,"I'm thinking tomyself, ""Good for you."
507,00:25:31.67,00:25:31.67,"Good for you, you'refinally thinking."""
508,00:25:33.37,00:25:33.37,- You'd rathergo against Tom.
509,00:25:35.07,00:25:35.07,"- He's always wantedto got rid of Lex,"
510,00:25:36.37,00:25:36.37,he just wouldn't do it.
511,00:25:37.60,00:25:37.60,"And I said, ""What ifLex doesn't get immunity?"""
512,00:25:40.40,00:25:40.40,and I can get Tomto vote Lex off?
513,00:25:42.37,00:25:42.37,And she saidthen she'd do that.
514,00:25:44.13,00:25:44.13,She said it's not too earlynow to do that.
515,00:25:45.70,00:25:45.70,"And I'm thinking, ""Well, hey,she's waking up a little bit."""
516,00:26:10.63,00:26:10.63,"- Well, ain't that nice."
517,00:26:14.10,00:26:14.10,What the hell is it?
518,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"A tisket, a tasket, I foundsomething in the basket."
519,00:26:19.93,00:26:19.93,- And look atwhat you found.
520,00:26:21.30,00:26:21.30,- And look whatI found.
521,00:26:23.00,00:26:23.00,Pretty little basket.
522,00:26:25.17,00:26:25.17,Okay.
523,00:26:26.70,00:26:26.70,"""Things are always easiersecond time around."
524,00:26:29.83,00:26:29.83,"""You are about to find outif it's as true as it sounds."
525,00:26:32.90,00:26:32.90,"""With the final four pending,you don't want to lose,"
526,00:26:36.27,00:26:36.27,"or at the Tribal Council itcould be you that they choose."""
527,00:26:43.57,00:26:43.57,This was in there.
528,00:26:45.27,00:26:45.27,I don't know if that hasanything to do--
529,00:26:46.67,00:26:46.67,I thought itwas a damn snake.
530,00:26:48.00,00:26:48.00,- What are those?
531,00:26:49.47,00:26:49.47,- Shells or beads.- They're seeds.
532,00:26:51.30,00:26:51.30,- This immunitychallenge coming up
533,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27,is certainly going to be themost important for me.
534,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,- What's thatgot to do with it?
535,00:26:56.97,00:26:56.97,- I don't know.
536,00:26:58.37,00:26:58.37,"- I'm the last Samburu left,so it would be easy for them"
537,00:27:00.70,00:27:00.70,right now just to go aheadand move me out.
538,00:27:02.77,00:27:02.77,- Or maybe it's somethingtotally different
539,00:27:06.97,00:27:06.97,and you got to runthrough something twice.
540,00:27:08.77,00:27:08.77,"- Whatever it is, I gottagive it all I've got."
541,00:27:34.47,00:27:34.47,"- Hello, you guys cango ahead and fall in."
542,00:27:37.90,00:27:37.90,"All right,first things first, Big Tom."
543,00:27:39.87,00:27:39.87,"Give it up, baby."
544,00:27:41.17,00:27:41.17,- I hate to.
545,00:27:42.67,00:27:42.67,"Uh-oh, my nose isa little large."
546,00:27:44.47,00:27:44.47,"You want tounbutton that, will you?"
547,00:27:45.63,00:27:45.63,- Let me unhook thatfor you.
548,00:27:46.70,00:27:46.70,- Thank you.- All right.
549,00:27:47.73,00:27:47.73,- I hate to see it go.
550,00:27:52.00,00:27:52.00,- Immunity is backup for grabs.
551,00:27:54.27,00:27:54.27,"Today's challenge,obviously a big one."
552,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,One of the qualitiesrequired to do well
553,00:27:59.23,00:27:59.23,in this game of Survivor is the ability
554,00:28:01.40,00:28:01.40,to learn from past mistakes.
555,00:28:03.60,00:28:03.60,Today you're gonna geta second chance
556,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,at elements fromprevious challenges.
557,00:28:08.13,00:28:08.13,"Some are physical,some are mental."
558,00:28:10.53,00:28:10.53,"To win it, you'll haveto do well at all of them."
559,00:28:13.33,00:28:13.33,It starts with apuzzle ladder.
560,00:28:15.93,00:28:15.93,Assemble the puzzle.
561,00:28:17.23,00:28:17.23,Use it to makeyour way up to the net.
562,00:28:18.67,00:28:18.67,"Go up one side of the net,down the other."
563,00:28:21.30,00:28:21.30,"You'll find a cart,contains pieces to a puzzle."
564,00:28:24.10,00:28:24.10,Drag the cart over toyour puzzle platform
565,00:28:26.87,00:28:26.87,and assemble the puzzle.
566,00:28:28.13,00:28:28.13,You'll then make your wayunder the ladder crawl
567,00:28:30.33,00:28:30.33,to your bow and arrows.
568,00:28:31.90,00:28:31.90,First person to hittheir target with an arrow
569,00:28:34.00,00:28:34.00,wins immunity.
570,00:28:35.13,00:28:35.13,Obviously this isa big challenge.
571,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,"Win this, you're inthe final four."
572,00:28:39.73,00:28:39.73,You guys are allstrong competitors.
573,00:28:41.77,00:28:41.77,This is game day.
574,00:28:42.90,00:28:42.90,"Take your positions,wait for my start."
575,00:28:48.70,00:28:48.70,"Here we go,immunity at stake."
576,00:28:50.73,00:28:50.73,Survivors ready?
577,00:28:52.53,00:28:52.53,Go!
578,00:29:18.13,00:29:18.13,(Tom groans)
579,00:29:22.37,00:29:22.37,- You guys areall pretty even.
580,00:29:24.33,00:29:24.33,All four pins in.
581,00:29:48.80,00:29:48.80,"That a way, Big Tom,you're in it."
582,00:29:50.23,00:29:50.23,You're in it!
583,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,"That a way, K.J."
584,00:30:01.80,00:30:01.80,You guys aredoing great.
585,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,You're all very even.
586,00:30:09.07,00:30:09.07,"Playing smart, you'rethinking, not panicking."
587,00:30:14.23,00:30:14.23,"That a way, Kim."
588,00:30:31.67,00:30:31.67,"That's good,Lex is done."
589,00:30:43.07,00:30:43.07,Lex is onhis last leg.
590,00:30:50.53,00:30:50.53,There it is!
591,00:30:55.60,00:30:55.60,"Nice shot,congratulations."
592,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,( laughs )
593,00:31:04.07,00:31:04.07,- Yeah!
594,00:31:10.17,00:31:10.17,"- Lex, after atemporary vacation,"
595,00:31:12.80,00:31:12.80,evidently it likes this homea little better.
596,00:31:16.27,00:31:16.27,"Congratulations.- Thank you, Jeff."
597,00:31:17.53,00:31:17.53,"- Immunity tonight,you are safe."
598,00:31:19.27,00:31:19.27,"The other four,somebody's going home."
599,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,Give you guys the afternoonto think about it.
600,00:31:23.93,00:31:23.93,I'll see you atTribal Council.
601,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,"- I feel close enoughto you, that I know"
602,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,we're going tosee each other more.
603,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,We're going to talk.
604,00:31:55.10,00:31:55.10,- T. Bird approached mebefore Tribal Council
605,00:31:57.53,00:31:57.53,and obviously needed tohave a heart-to-heart.
606,00:31:59.47,00:31:59.47,She is the odd person outat this point.
607,00:32:01.67,00:32:01.67,She's the onlyperson that's left
608,00:32:03.63,00:32:03.63,that's from the originalSamburu.
609,00:32:05.50,00:32:05.50,"Um, she's ina mess of hurt."
610,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,Somehow we worked it out towhere everyone that's left
611,00:32:12.20,00:32:12.20,is a sweet person.
612,00:32:14.70,00:32:14.70,- Mm-hmm.
613,00:32:15.83,00:32:15.83,"For me, it's I guesskind of bittersweet."
614,00:32:18.43,00:32:18.43,I know that I'm goingto be the next one to go
615,00:32:19.93,00:32:19.93,unless I can think ofsomething real quick.
616,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,Just watch yourself.
617,00:32:25.43,00:32:25.43,"Because even with alliances,people have their own agendas."
618,00:32:30.47,00:32:30.47,"- I know, I know."
619,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,- I had thought of everydifferent way I could play it.
620,00:32:34.17,00:32:34.17,"And unfortunately, with Lexgetting immunity,"
621,00:32:36.37,00:32:36.37,"that cut downa lot of my options,"
622,00:32:38.23,00:32:38.23,"and I really only hadone option to go,"
623,00:32:40.47,00:32:40.47,and that was withtrying to get Lex
624,00:32:43.33,00:32:43.33,and Kim Johnsonto vote off Tom.
625,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,"When I came overto this tribe,"
626,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,a little birdiewhispered something in my ear.
627,00:32:50.37,00:32:50.37,"- T. Bird is obviouslystruggling with something,"
628,00:32:52.37,00:32:52.37,"and so she said, ""I needyou to sit down."
629,00:32:54.63,00:32:54.63,"""I have somethingI need to confess to you."
630,00:32:56.07,00:32:56.07,"""I have something beforewe go to Tribal Council"
631,00:32:57.90,00:32:57.90,"I need to tell you."""
632,00:32:59.60,00:32:59.60,"- Knowing prettysure I was gone,"
633,00:33:01.97,00:33:01.97,"I thought I don't haveanything to lose, anyway,"
634,00:33:03.77,00:33:03.77,I'll go ahead and let him knowthat I was the one
635,00:33:06.03,00:33:06.03,that put the vote against Lex.
636,00:33:08.97,00:33:08.97,"- And she said, you know, ""Whenyou got that one mystery vote,"""
637,00:33:12.37,00:33:12.37,"who at the timeI thought might be Kelly,"
638,00:33:13.90,00:33:13.90,"""I was the one that castthat vote for you."""
639,00:33:17.37,00:33:17.37,- The reason I changed my votewas because before we left
640,00:33:21.23,00:33:21.23,"for Tribal Council,when we were in here,"
641,00:33:24.53,00:33:24.53,"somebody came up and whisperedto me, ""Watch out for Lex."""
642,00:33:28.33,00:33:28.33,- Who told you towatch out for me?
643,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,- I can't tell you.
644,00:33:31.70,00:33:31.70,"- Well, I sincerelyhope it was Kelly."
645,00:33:34.03,00:33:34.03,"I said, well, there's notmore than a couple people"
646,00:33:36.07,00:33:36.07,that it could be because you'retelling me to watch my back.
647,00:33:38.70,00:33:38.70,Did Tom tell younot to trust me?
648,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,"I mean, that's the onlyperson I can think of"
649,00:33:44.57,00:33:44.57,"that just, it all fits."
650,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,And she just looked atme and went like this.
651,00:33:50.73,00:33:50.73,I don't understand.
652,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"In telling her that,Tom is basically giving her"
653,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,a green light that I was theright person to vote for.
654,00:33:58.83,00:33:58.83,I just don't get it.
655,00:34:00.10,00:34:00.10,"And I also found out,you know, at that point,"
656,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,Mama Cat told me that shehad also been approached
657,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27,by Tom on morethan one occasion.
658,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,"- He said, you know,""If you vote Lex off,"
659,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,"""you know, it wouldbe good if you did it,"
660,00:34:10.07,00:34:10.07,"""but don't let me knowanything about it."
661,00:34:11.50,00:34:11.50,"I don't want to know about it,but it'd be a good thing to do."""
662,00:34:13.53,00:34:13.53,"And I said, if you want him offso bad, let him vote him off."
663,00:34:15.50,00:34:15.50,- It's a pity.
664,00:34:16.77,00:34:16.77,"- Tom wants Lex off, but hesays ""I can't vote him,"""
665,00:34:19.57,00:34:19.57,"so he wants everybody elseto do the dirty work for him,"
666,00:34:22.57,00:34:22.57,so he still lookslike the good guy.
667,00:34:24.37,00:34:24.37,- How many people on the juryknow that side of him?
668,00:34:29.13,00:34:29.13,- Nobody.- Nobody.
669,00:34:30.27,00:34:30.27,"- No.- Well, that's a problem."
670,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,That's why I-- that's whyI'd have a hard time
671,00:34:36.17,00:34:36.17,going up against him.
672,00:34:37.30,00:34:37.30,- Well...
673,00:34:39.37,00:34:39.37,"- Well, I appreciateyour telling me."
674,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,- Thanks for telling me.
675,00:34:42.53,00:34:42.53,- All right.
676,00:34:47.03,00:34:47.03,"- Well, it just got way more--way more sinister."
677,00:34:51.27,00:34:51.27,- Tommy's sort of insularin his thinking.
678,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,Tommy's looking out forTommy most of the time.
679,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,"Whatever Tommy wantsto do, Tommy does,"
680,00:34:57.37,00:34:57.37,regardless of itseffect on other people.
681,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,"- I don't,but thank you."
682,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"Ultimately, I am responsiblefor myself and nobody else."
683,00:35:07.47,00:35:07.47,It's completelygone to cutthroat mode.
684,00:35:09.73,00:35:09.73,"And if I think that Tom, if Ithink that he's in a situation"
685,00:35:12.60,00:35:12.60,"where he is about to screw meover and stab me in the back,"
686,00:35:14.93,00:35:14.93,I'll cut his throat.
687,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,- We'll now bringin our jury.
688,00:36:12.37,00:36:12.37,Up to four members now.
689,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,"Well, I gotta call attentionto something I just noticed"
690,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,"when the jury walked in,which is the shirt"
691,00:36:32.40,00:36:32.40,that Kelly's wearing.
692,00:36:34.27,00:36:34.27,"""Shameless,"" which I canonly imagine"
693,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,is referring backto last Tribal Council
694,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,when the whole notion of theWalk of Shame came up.
695,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43,Is that what youguys feel as a group?
696,00:36:43.43,00:36:43.43,Is it a Walk of Shame?
697,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,- That was actually aterm that was coined
698,00:36:47.77,00:36:47.77,a long time ago and waskind of the common term
699,00:36:50.13,00:36:50.13,that we all usedaround the camp anyway.
700,00:36:52.87,00:36:52.87,"It has nothing to do with thatbeing a shameful place to be,"
701,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,that there being anyshame in being voted off
702,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,or being out of the tribe.
703,00:37:01.53,00:37:01.53,It was just a term we allkind of coined and used freely
704,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,without really thinkingabout what somebody
705,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,might interpret it as.
706,00:37:09.57,00:37:09.57,"- Big Tom, does itmake you more aware"
707,00:37:12.33,00:37:12.33,"of what you are saying,knowing the jury is listening,"
708,00:37:14.23,00:37:14.23,or was that justnot a big deal
709,00:37:16.17,00:37:16.17,and you shouldbe blunt about it.
710,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"- It probably oughtto be a big deal,"
711,00:37:19.60,00:37:19.60,but every one of themon that jury knows me.
712,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"And they know if it comesthrough my brain,"
713,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,"it'll come outmy mouth, and I--"
714,00:37:26.57,00:37:26.57,I'm too old to change now.
715,00:37:28.90,00:37:28.90,I'm not going to changefor them or these or you.
716,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,"I'm whom I am,and that's it."
717,00:37:35.57,00:37:35.57,"No, I'm going to saywhatever comes out"
718,00:37:39.10,00:37:39.10,and I'll stand by it.
719,00:37:40.43,00:37:40.43,"- Ethan, how acuteare your senses now"
720,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,after being out withno distractions
721,00:37:46.23,00:37:46.23,for over a month in Africa?
722,00:37:49.20,00:37:49.20,"- Well, you know,just not as sharp."
723,00:37:51.30,00:37:51.30,"You know, mentallyyou're not as sharp,"
724,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,"and you know, youtrip over things"
725,00:37:55.10,00:37:55.10,that you weren'ttripping over before.
726,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,"You know, now that I'm layingon the ground, I'm thin."
727,00:37:58.97,00:37:58.97,"You feel the groundmore than ever, you know."
728,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,"Your ribs are sticking into theearth, so in terms of that."
729,00:38:05.70,00:38:05.70,But mentallyI'm not sharp--
730,00:38:08.33,00:38:08.33,as sharp anymore.
731,00:38:09.87,00:38:09.87,"I'm just, you know,it's tough."
732,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,It wears on you.
733,00:38:13.43,00:38:13.43,"You know,you're tired all the time,"
734,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,you're hungryall the time.
735,00:38:16.07,00:38:16.07,"You're-- you know,so in that sense,"
736,00:38:18.40,00:38:18.40,I think some of my acutenesshas gone far away.
737,00:38:21.53,00:38:21.53,"- Teresa, I gotta bring up,"
738,00:38:22.83,00:38:22.83,you're the last ofthe original Samburu.
739,00:38:26.13,00:38:26.13,- I was hoping you wouldn'tnotice that.
740,00:38:28.13,00:38:28.13,"Actually, I was hoping they wouldn't notice that."
741,00:38:31.80,00:38:31.80,"- Well, do you thinkthey haven't?"
742,00:38:33.10,00:38:33.10,"- Yeah, they've noticed it."
743,00:38:34.40,00:38:34.40,"You know, I feel like Iwas lucky to be brought"
744,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,"into the old Boran tribeearlier than the merge,"
745,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,"so I got to know,especially Ethan and Kim."
746,00:38:46.13,00:38:46.13,"You know, I never thoughtI'd get to this point."
747,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,I never thoughtI'd make the final five.
748,00:38:52.00,00:38:52.00,"- All right, we'regoing to vote in a minute."
749,00:38:53.13,00:38:53.13,"Before we do, onefinal question,"
750,00:38:54.60,00:38:54.60,"Tom, know whoyou're voting for tonight?"
751,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,- Mm-hmm.- And do you have a game plan
752,00:38:57.03,00:38:57.03,from here on out?
753,00:38:58.20,00:38:58.20,"- I might be that onegets voted off tonight,"
754,00:39:00.20,00:39:00.20,so you can't make a game plantill after this thing's over.
755,00:39:03.80,00:39:03.80,I might-- I've got my bagspacked like everybody else.
756,00:39:07.37,00:39:07.37,You don't know in this gamewhen you're going
757,00:39:09.57,00:39:09.57,or when you're coming.
758,00:39:10.80,00:39:10.80,So I'm going-- I'll justwait till it gets closer
759,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,and see what happensafter tonight.
760,00:39:15.57,00:39:15.57,"- Okay, it's time tovote."
761,00:39:16.77,00:39:16.77,K.J. you're up first.
762,00:39:32.70,00:39:32.70,"- T. Bird, you've beena good friend"
763,00:39:34.80,00:39:34.80,and you've been my pleasure.
764,00:39:37.63,00:39:37.63,Keep that wonderful smile
765,00:39:38.90,00:39:38.90,'cause you are anawful good girl.
766,00:39:42.47,00:39:42.47,See you around.
767,00:39:55.03,00:39:55.03,"- It's with a heavy heart thatI cast this vote for you,"
768,00:39:57.63,00:39:57.63,a really heavy heart.
769,00:40:15.73,00:40:15.73,- I'll go tallythe votes.
770,00:40:35.90,00:40:35.90,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final."
771,00:40:38.27,00:40:38.27,Person will be asked to leavethe Tribal Council area
772,00:40:39.87,00:40:39.87,immediately.

776,00:40:56.43,00:40:56.43,"T. Bird,that's two for Teresa."
777,00:41:07.67,00:41:07.67,"Three votes,that's enough."
778,00:41:09.27,00:41:09.27,No need to readthe other two.
779,00:41:10.53,00:41:10.53,You need tobring your torch.
780,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,- The fat lady's singing?
781,00:41:13.67,00:41:13.67,Afraid so.
782,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,"- Teresa, the tribehas spoken."
783,00:41:35.00,00:41:35.00,It's time for you to go.
784,00:41:36.50,00:41:36.50,- Bye.

791,00:42:25.13,00:42:25.13,I never dreamedI'd make it
792,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93,"to be one ofthe 16 survivors,"
793,00:42:28.87,00:42:28.87,much less be one of the fiveremaining survivors.
794,00:42:31.47,00:42:31.47,"It's something I will,of course, never forget."
795,00:42:33.30,00:42:33.30,I appreciate having theopportunity to be here
