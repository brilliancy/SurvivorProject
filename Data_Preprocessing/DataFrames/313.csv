9,00:00:17.73,00:00:17.73, to the Masai Mara to watch  the wildebeest migration.
10,00:00:20.70,00:00:20.70,"- They're crazier than hell, they're ugly."
11,00:00:22.50,00:00:22.50,They're as ugly as a girl I used to date back home.
12,00:00:27.33,00:00:27.33,- The safari was amazing.
13,00:00:29.60,00:00:29.60,"Oh, look at that, look, look, look-- a hunt!"
14,00:00:31.20,00:00:31.20,"I'm seeing stuff that I had never seen,"
15,00:00:33.00,00:00:33.00,just like a dream come true.

21,00:00:40.30,00:00:40.30, ...and Lex was  on shaky ground.
22,00:00:42.80,00:00:42.80,"- Even after we went on our safari,"
23,00:00:44.83,00:00:44.83,I'm still irritated at Lex.
24,00:00:46.37,00:00:46.37,I don't think he did me right.
25,00:00:47.97,00:00:47.97," - At Tribal Council, Lex  expressed his vulnerability."
26,00:00:51.30,00:00:51.30,- I know what it's like to almost be taking
27,00:00:53.53,00:00:53.53,that walk of shame.
28,00:00:54.80,00:00:54.80," - But when the votes  were tallied,"

32,00:01:01.27,00:01:01.27, It was her time to go.
33,00:01:03.33,00:01:03.33, Five are left.
34,00:01:04.87,00:01:04.87," Tonight, the members of  Moto Maji will make a play"
35,00:01:07.27,00:01:07.27," for the final four, as they  vote one more of their own"
36,00:01:10.20,00:01:10.20, out of the tribe.

39,00:02:46.73,00:02:46.73,"in Kenya, in Moto Maji camp."
40,00:02:49.10,00:02:49.10,"Five people, that's it."
41,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,Started with 16.
42,00:02:53.00,00:02:53.00,"Now we're down to five, amazing."
43,00:02:55.00,00:02:55.00,"- Morning, T-Bird. - Morning."
44,00:02:56.17,00:02:56.17,"- How are you? - Morning, T-Bird."
45,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60,"- Morning, everybody. - How you doing?"
46,00:02:59.17,00:02:59.17,"- Doing good, how are ya'll doing?"
47,00:03:00.33,00:03:00.33,"- Good, good, good."
48,00:03:01.47,00:03:01.47,- Every little thing we do now is a huge effort.
49,00:03:03.63,00:03:03.63,We're beginning to talk more in terms now
50,00:03:06.20,00:03:06.20,"of when we're going home, we are counting the days."
51,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27,I think it's starting to take a toll on our bodies.
52,00:03:10.27,00:03:10.27,- Every night my arms go to sleep.
53,00:03:11.70,00:03:11.70,- My whole damn arm.
54,00:03:12.90,00:03:12.90,"- It's not just my arm, my ass goes to sleep."
55,00:03:16.03,00:03:16.03,My shoulder goes to sleep.
56,00:03:17.60,00:03:17.60,"- Just my arm, my hand..."
57,00:03:19.53,00:03:19.53,"- I never thought it was going to be this hard,"
58,00:03:21.37,00:03:21.37,"physically, mentally, psychologically, emotionally."
59,00:03:24.43,00:03:24.43,"And now that we're so close to the end, I'm exhausted."
60,00:03:27.00,00:03:27.00,"But up until just the last few days, I've really tried hard"
61,00:03:31.83,00:03:31.83,not to think about my kids and my wife.
62,00:03:34.40,00:03:34.40,"Two buckets, two gourds."
63,00:03:36.43,00:03:36.43,But I can't allow myself to give into any of that
64,00:03:39.20,00:03:39.20,until I'm finished.
65,00:03:43.80,00:03:43.80,"You can't afford, out here, to be a sissy."
66,00:03:49.00,00:03:49.00,"It has been pretty funny that we take our drinking water,"
67,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50,basically out of an elephant's toilet.
68,00:03:53.20,00:03:53.20,We got an elephant disrespecting our spring.
69,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,"- Oh, how disgusting is that?"
70,00:03:57.17,00:03:57.17,- Right where we do our laundry.
71,00:03:59.43,00:03:59.43,"I mean, he could have picked anywhere."
72,00:04:00.97,00:04:00.97,He might as well have just put his butt
73,00:04:02.13,00:04:02.13,right over the spring.
74,00:04:03.17,00:04:03.17,- That's a monster of a turd.
75,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40,- That's a jackpot.
76,00:04:06.83,00:04:06.83,"- Yeah, and it's already covered in gnats."
77,00:04:09.47,00:04:09.47,- I find in the water hole relaxation.
78,00:04:14.10,00:04:14.10,"We love this spot, we come here all the time."
79,00:04:16.47,00:04:16.47,"And today, we were visited by someone"
80,00:04:18.53,00:04:18.53,just prior to our getting here
81,00:04:20.87,00:04:20.87,that left us a big giant gift.
82,00:04:25.07,00:04:25.07,"It's very fresh, very smelly,"
83,00:04:28.67,00:04:28.67,"very large, and we're getting used to it."
84,00:04:32.63,00:04:32.63,- You got to drink and you got to pull your water
85,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17,"and you got to wash, but God, holy mackerel,"
86,00:04:37.13,00:04:37.13,"that elephant, he couldn't have picked"
87,00:04:38.93,00:04:38.93,a better spot to relieve himself in.
88,00:04:41.33,00:04:41.33,It looked like he hadn't done his business
89,00:04:43.07,00:04:43.07,in a couple weeks.
90,00:04:44.07,00:04:44.07,(elephant rumbling)
91,00:04:47.77,00:04:47.77,- I want to be in harmony with all the animals
92,00:04:50.37,00:04:50.37,"and all the people, but it's hard to do,"
93,00:04:53.40,00:04:53.40,especially here down at the end.
94,00:04:55.27,00:04:55.27,"- I wonder if you drowned yourself,"
95,00:04:56.80,00:04:56.80,now you're so quiet?
96,00:04:57.93,00:04:57.93,- I'm in deep thought.
97,00:04:59.20,00:04:59.20,- Kim Johnson washes in elephant [...] every day.
98,00:05:05.00,00:05:05.00,"And I've told her, I said, ""Kim, down there"
99,00:05:08.60,00:05:08.60,"""at the bottom of that creek, I said, you are washing"
100,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,"""where the elephants has pooped in the water."
101,00:05:13.93,00:05:13.93,"""You're washing in that-- washing your clothes,"
102,00:05:16.10,00:05:16.10,"washing your face, washing your hind end."""
103,00:05:18.43,00:05:18.43,"She has yet to understand that,"
104,00:05:20.93,00:05:20.93,and I've quit telling her.
105,00:05:22.23,00:05:22.23,And I let her wash in it every day.
106,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,"I keep thinking, I try to smell it,"
107,00:05:29.20,00:05:29.20,"see if she smells like an elephant, but really she don't."
108,00:05:31.90,00:05:31.90,"But, she's washed in it every day."
109,00:05:33.87,00:05:33.87,And I... I quit telling her.
110,00:05:36.97,00:05:36.97,- Okay.
111,00:05:40.83,00:05:40.83,One foot in front of the other.
112,00:05:42.30,00:05:42.30,- That's right.
113,00:05:49.77,00:05:49.77,"- This stage of the game, boredom is something"
114,00:05:51.63,00:05:51.63,that has definitely become a reality.
115,00:05:54.20,00:05:54.20,"Plus, I mean, frankly, we've been out here 35 days."
116,00:05:56.20,00:05:56.20,We're running out of things to talk about and things to do.
117,00:05:58.37,00:05:58.37,- (whistling)
118,00:06:00.23,00:06:00.23,- I've probably gotten to know the four other people
119,00:06:02.73,00:06:02.73,that are left here better than some people
120,00:06:04.57,00:06:04.57,"that I've known for five, ten years."
121,00:06:07.67,00:06:07.67,"Tom, you got to put those things far away."
122,00:06:09.77,00:06:09.77,"- Yeah, you got to put them, maybe, in the fire."
123,00:06:11.73,00:06:11.73,- (laughing)
124,00:06:13.07,00:06:13.07,"- No, I'm serious, I think it would be a good for us"
125,00:06:15.33,00:06:15.33,if we burned those.
126,00:06:16.70,00:06:16.70,"Tom's feet stink, perhaps, the worst I've ever smelled"
127,00:06:19.73,00:06:19.73,"of anyone's feet, on the planet Earth."
128,00:06:22.10,00:06:22.10,And... they smell so bad.
129,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17,He's got some funk down there that I've never smelled before.
130,00:06:27.97,00:06:27.97,- I don't like being so close to you.
131,00:06:29.60,00:06:29.60,- Everybody complains.
132,00:06:30.77,00:06:30.77,"Ethan is terrible, he hates 'em."
133,00:06:32.60,00:06:32.60,"He raises hell, he wants me to move my shoes."
134,00:06:35.53,00:06:35.53,"He told me, throw my shoes away."
135,00:06:37.23,00:06:37.23,"- Good gust of wind, that [...] smell is going in my nose."
136,00:06:40.77,00:06:40.77,I can't stand it.
137,00:06:43.73,00:06:43.73,Just throw them away.
138,00:06:45.43,00:06:45.43,- I can't throw my boots away.
139,00:06:47.50,00:06:47.50,- Don't put them near my head.
140,00:06:48.63,00:06:48.63,Put them over near the water.
141,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,"They're bad, he's got a problem."
142,00:06:51.53,00:06:51.53,I think he's got a problem.
143,00:06:52.93,00:06:52.93,(Tom whistling)
144,00:07:07.10,00:07:07.10,(Tom yawning)
145,00:07:09.47,00:07:09.47,(chicken clucking)
146,00:07:12.47,00:07:12.47,- Some water there?
147,00:07:14.13,00:07:14.13,- Yeah.
148,00:07:15.33,00:07:15.33,"- We're sitting there, enjoying our popcorn,"
149,00:07:17.20,00:07:17.20,and Tom is like...
150,00:07:18.57,00:07:18.57,"- Hey, hey, hey!"
151,00:07:19.63,00:07:19.63,"Hell, Big Red's out."
152,00:07:21.83,00:07:21.83,"- Oh my God. - Nobody move, I'll get him."
153,00:07:23.30,00:07:23.30,I'll get him. I'll get him.
154,00:07:24.60,00:07:24.60,We're buddies.
155,00:07:25.97,00:07:25.97,"- Buddies, hell, get the hatchet."
156,00:07:28.23,00:07:28.23,A lot of people saw a chicken out.
157,00:07:30.40,00:07:30.40,"I saw my dinner out, walking around,"
158,00:07:32.73,00:07:32.73,and it might get out of that bunker.
159,00:07:34.17,00:07:34.17,"- Come here, little bugger."
160,00:07:35.20,00:07:35.20,"- Come here, Big Red."
161,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,(clucking frantically)
162,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67,- Headed in your direction.
163,00:07:43.33,00:07:43.33,"- They were panicking a little bit,"
164,00:07:44.77,00:07:44.77,wanting to run the chicken.
165,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13,Worst thing you could do is run that chicken.
166,00:07:47.97,00:07:47.97,So I just laid there.
167,00:07:49.63,00:07:49.63,I didn't want to panic that chicken.
168,00:07:51.43,00:07:51.43,"Just bring her to me, bring her on to me."
169,00:07:53.17,00:07:53.17,Throw some corn right in front of me.
170,00:07:56.30,00:07:56.30,- That chicken kind of walked by Tom.
171,00:07:58.47,00:07:58.47,"He's laying down, half asleep, just..."
172,00:08:01.00,00:08:01.00,(clucking frantically)
173,00:08:03.30,00:08:03.30,"Got both legs, the chicken, he's like, got it."
174,00:08:06.43,00:08:06.43,"It was pretty, pretty impressive."
175,00:08:08.27,00:08:08.27,"- Tom, no, we're not killing her today."
176,00:08:09.90,00:08:09.90,"Tommy, stop! - (Tom growling)"
177,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,"- Stop it, Tom, Tom!"
178,00:08:12.97,00:08:12.97,(Tom spits)
179,00:08:13.97,00:08:13.97,- Give me a bite of that.
180,00:08:15.03,00:08:15.03,- Damn chicken. - Give me a bite.
181,00:08:16.63,00:08:16.63,"We just pretended to wrestle it and have a little fun,"
182,00:08:19.70,00:08:19.70,a little excitement in the day.
183,00:08:21.47,00:08:21.47,"You know, maybe we'll let it out some more and try to catch it."
184,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,Let's have some fun.
185,00:08:25.33,00:08:25.33,- She'll be a chicken potpie?
186,00:08:44.33,00:08:44.33,"- We went to tree mail, expecting that"
187,00:08:45.47,00:08:45.47,it was going to be challenge time.
188,00:08:47.23,00:08:47.23,- Something big.
189,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,"- Oh, I like big."
190,00:08:50.00,00:08:50.00,"- This was a completely different kind of tree mail,"
191,00:08:51.97,00:08:51.97,because we opened up the mailbox
192,00:08:53.10,00:08:53.10,and it was an instant reward.
193,00:08:54.93,00:08:54.93,"Well, there's something for each and every one of us here."
194,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83,- Yay!
195,00:08:59.03,00:08:59.03,- Mail call.
196,00:09:00.73,00:09:00.73,"Teresa, Kim, and Lex."
197,00:09:05.43,00:09:05.43,- From Ali!
198,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,(cheering)
199,00:09:09.43,00:09:09.43,- A letter?
200,00:09:10.47,00:09:10.47,A letter?
201,00:09:12.07,00:09:12.07,- Oh!
202,00:09:13.40,00:09:13.40,"Oh, oh!"
203,00:09:15.33,00:09:15.33,"Oh, my God."
204,00:09:16.73,00:09:16.73,- I've got a whole mess of letters.
205,00:09:19.10,00:09:19.10,"I had letters from my wife, from my two sons,"
206,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,"from my mother, my father."
207,00:09:24.50,00:09:24.50,It doesn't get any better than that.
208,00:09:30.00,00:09:30.00,It gave me what I need to get through the next few days.
209,00:09:33.00,00:09:33.00,It fed my body and my soul.
210,00:09:35.50,00:09:35.50,(sniffles)
211,00:09:40.07,00:09:40.07,- It seems like the first one I probably grabbed
212,00:09:42.00,00:09:42.00,"was from my dad, because his health"
213,00:09:44.23,00:09:44.23,is not very good.
214,00:09:45.47,00:09:45.47,"Before I left, I remember telling him,"
215,00:09:47.10,00:09:47.10,"""You better be here when I get back."""
216,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,So I think his letter probably touched me the most
217,00:09:51.43,00:09:51.43,because I worry the most about him.
218,00:09:58.77,00:09:58.77,"- ""Don't forget the pressure's on,"
219,00:10:00.70,00:10:00.70,"""so if you feel like giving up and being a puss,"
220,00:10:03.77,00:10:03.77,"""just remember that you have to be tough"
221,00:10:05.60,00:10:05.60,"and uphold my reputation now that I'm the big dog."""
222,00:10:09.80,00:10:09.80,Is that some way to talk to your dad?
223,00:10:20.37,00:10:20.37,"- It's really good to hear from them,"
224,00:10:21.50,00:10:21.50,'cause they put their ink on this paper.
225,00:10:24.97,00:10:24.97,"You know, they touched this paper, and we can touch them."
226,00:10:28.10,00:10:28.10,So it's... it's really nice.
227,00:10:31.53,00:10:31.53,(sniffles)
228,00:10:33.93,00:10:33.93,- It was just the best.
229,00:10:35.10,00:10:35.10,Just to hear from home was unbelievable.
230,00:10:36.67,00:10:36.67,It was great.
231,00:10:41.03,00:10:41.03,"My husband wrote me a poem, and he's not a poem writer."
232,00:10:43.50,00:10:43.50,Kippy's my nickname.
233,00:10:44.97,00:10:44.97,"And actually, even before I came on this,"
234,00:10:47.03,00:10:47.03,"he's always called me ""Survivor Kippy."""
235,00:10:53.00,00:10:53.00,"""There once was a girl named Kippy Grant,"
236,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,"""who never said the words 'I can't.'"
237,00:10:56.70,00:10:56.70,"""Friends all say she's not like most dames,"
238,00:10:58.83,00:10:58.83,"""and now she's gone in Kenya, you know."
239,00:11:00.50,00:11:00.50,"""It's hard to cover for Kippy's no-show."
240,00:11:02.77,00:11:02.77,"""For a mom and a wife who really loves living..."
241,00:11:04.90,00:11:04.90,(sniffles)
242,00:11:07.67,00:11:07.67,"We're lucky indeed you're always so giving."""
243,00:11:09.90,00:11:09.90,- That's a great poem.
244,00:11:15.87,00:11:15.87,- This experience would be nothing
245,00:11:17.50,00:11:17.50,if I didn't have somebody to go back and share it with.
246,00:11:21.27,00:11:21.27,It definitely brought a calm and a reality to me
247,00:11:24.27,00:11:24.27,"that, you know, the game's almost over,"
248,00:11:25.70,00:11:25.70,and that's where I'm going back to.
249,00:11:43.43,00:11:43.43,- Mailman's early today.
250,00:11:51.67,00:11:51.67,"You guys, we have tree mail."
251,00:11:53.43,00:11:53.43,- Okay.
252,00:11:55.07,00:11:55.07,- You guys ready? - Yeah.
253,00:11:57.00,00:11:57.00,"- ""Reward Haiku: A surprise visit."
254,00:12:00.17,00:12:00.17,"For one whose brain is sharpest but who will claim it?"""
255,00:12:04.07,00:12:04.07,- I cannot believe that as far out in the middle of...
256,00:12:08.47,00:12:08.47,"nowhere we are, that there is actually the possibility"
257,00:12:12.37,00:12:12.37,"of a visit, I just--"
258,00:12:13.73,00:12:13.73,- A surprise visit may be for us to go see something.
259,00:12:17.43,00:12:17.43,- It doesn't say a surprise visitor.
260,00:12:19.30,00:12:19.30,- Interesting.
261,00:12:20.67,00:12:20.67,"- ""Brain is sharpest."" Hmm..."
262,00:12:22.80,00:12:22.80,- Maybe we have to write a Haiku or something.
263,00:12:24.77,00:12:24.77,- Tell me what a haiku is again?
264,00:12:26.40,00:12:26.40,- It's a Japanese poem.
265,00:12:27.77,00:12:27.77,- That's a haiku.
266,00:12:28.97,00:12:28.97,"- Oh, my God!"
267,00:12:30.13,00:12:30.13,"I can't even say ""haiku."""
268,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,"- All right, today's reward challenge is not physical."
269,00:12:53.17,00:12:53.17,"Doesn't require endurance, it's strictly mental."
270,00:12:55.93,00:12:55.93,It's a word scramble.
271,00:12:57.37,00:12:57.37,You'll have a list of 12 Swahili words.
272,00:12:59.97,00:12:59.97,"Each time you find a word, circle it."
273,00:13:02.57,00:13:02.57,Mark it off your list.
274,00:13:03.90,00:13:03.90,"Each word will intersect with at least one other word,"
275,00:13:07.57,00:13:07.57,and that is the key to solving this puzzle.
276,00:13:09.80,00:13:09.80,"Once you found all 12 words, take the intersecting letters,"
277,00:13:13.03,00:13:13.03,"unscramble them, and make one final English word."
278,00:13:16.50,00:13:16.50,"To help you out, there's a clue"
279,00:13:17.90,00:13:17.90,tacked to the bottom of your board for the final word.
280,00:13:20.13,00:13:20.13,First person to get the final word correct...
281,00:13:22.80,00:13:22.80,wins a reward.
282,00:13:23.90,00:13:23.90,There's two parts to your reward today.
283,00:13:26.20,00:13:26.20,The answer to your puzzle will explain the first part.
284,00:13:28.90,00:13:28.90,"Second part, I'll tell you about later."
285,00:13:30.83,00:13:30.83,It's going to be a great reward.
286,00:13:32.93,00:13:32.93,Shall we get it on? - Yes.
287,00:13:34.33,00:13:34.33,"- Let's go, pick a board."
288,00:13:36.83,00:13:36.83,"Here we go, guys, survivors ready?"
289,00:13:40.93,00:13:40.93,Go!
290,00:13:55.60,00:13:55.60,Lex has two.
291,00:14:05.00,00:14:05.00,Look carefully.
292,00:14:06.30,00:14:06.30,They're all there.
293,00:14:15.67,00:14:15.67,Lex now has four.
294,00:14:21.53,00:14:21.53,K.J. got one.
295,00:14:25.77,00:14:25.77,You're on the board.
296,00:14:26.97,00:14:26.97,- Thank God.
297,00:14:28.10,00:14:28.10,- Tom got his first one.
298,00:14:33.60,00:14:33.60,Lex in the early lead with five.
299,00:14:39.70,00:14:39.70,Kim Johnson has two.
300,00:14:42.83,00:14:42.83,Ethan with three.
301,00:14:45.27,00:14:45.27,Big Tom has two.
302,00:14:50.93,00:14:50.93,"Lex with six, still in the lead."
303,00:14:54.97,00:14:54.97,T-Bird with two.
304,00:14:58.83,00:14:58.83,Ethan with three.
305,00:15:06.57,00:15:06.57,Teresa still with three.
306,00:15:15.37,00:15:15.37,Lex with nine.
307,00:15:16.60,00:15:16.60,Only three more to go.
308,00:15:24.67,00:15:24.67,"Lex has 12, he's working on his clue."
309,00:15:28.33,00:15:28.33,Ethan's at six.
310,00:15:39.23,00:15:39.23,K.J. up to four.
311,00:15:57.93,00:15:57.93,Lex is spelling out his final word.
312,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,"Winner, Lex."
313,00:16:06.40,00:16:06.40,- Yes!
314,00:16:07.93,00:16:07.93,"- Congratulations, my friend. - Thank you."
315,00:16:09.37,00:16:09.37,- It's going to be a great day.
316,00:16:11.97,00:16:11.97,- Yeah!
317,00:16:18.57,00:16:18.57,"- Hey, guys, we're going to take a little walk."
318,00:16:25.23,00:16:25.23,"- Oh, I see a wheel."
319,00:16:27.50,00:16:27.50,- Some chrome. - I see some chrome.
320,00:16:30.20,00:16:30.20,Get out of town.
321,00:16:33.13,00:16:33.13,"- Chevy Avalanche, it's all yours."
322,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,"- Oh, yeah!"
323,00:16:38.47,00:16:38.47,- When I walked around that bush and saw
324,00:16:40.83,00:16:40.83,"that big blue Chevy truck and knew it wasn't mine,"
325,00:16:44.03,00:16:44.03,"I was so, like, jealous."
326,00:16:49.47,00:16:49.47,So I was annoyed and a little pissed off.
327,00:16:52.07,00:16:52.07,"Trying to be happy for Lex, but deep down inside,"
328,00:16:54.43,00:16:54.43,I wasn't that happy for him.
329,00:16:55.80,00:16:55.80,"It's tough, it's annoying."
330,00:16:57.07,00:16:57.07,"You know, I just-- I don't want him to win anymore."
331,00:17:03.37,00:17:03.37,- Now let's get to the special visit
332,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,part of this reward.
333,00:17:07.70,00:17:07.70,You're going to have a great honor.
334,00:17:08.87,00:17:08.87,"You are going to be an ambassador of good will,"
335,00:17:11.03,00:17:11.03,"because, as you guys certainly know,"
336,00:17:13.37,00:17:13.37,"AIDS in Africa, huge problem."
337,00:17:15.37,00:17:15.37,So we've loaded up some really special cargo.
338,00:17:18.30,00:17:18.30,Hop off and I'll show you what it is.
339,00:17:23.13,00:17:23.13,"- Oh, nice!"
340,00:17:24.90,00:17:24.90,"- This, plus another truckload,"
341,00:17:26.77,00:17:26.77,is a year's worth of medical supplies.
342,00:17:28.50,00:17:28.50,We're taking it to Wamba Hospital.
343,00:17:30.60,00:17:30.60,"It's the coolest place, this guy started it in 1961."
344,00:17:33.63,00:17:33.63,"40 years, only on charitable donations."
345,00:17:36.37,00:17:36.37,"- When they opened up the back of the truck, I saw ""H.I.V."""
346,00:17:40.47,00:17:40.47,It was very emotional for me because my brother
347,00:17:43.43,00:17:43.43,"passed away of AIDS, so right away when I saw that"
348,00:17:46.20,00:17:46.20,it just brought back all the emotions of everything.
349,00:17:48.70,00:17:48.70,"Unfortunately, 11 years ago, there was so little"
350,00:17:52.10,00:17:52.10,known about AIDS.
351,00:17:53.43,00:17:53.43,It made me very happy.
352,00:17:55.93,00:17:55.93,- That's fantastic.
353,00:18:00.53,00:18:00.53,"- Let's get out of here, you're driving."
354,00:18:10.97,00:18:10.97,"- When I won the truck, Jeff explained to me,"
355,00:18:13.50,00:18:13.50,"kind of, what the visit part of the reward was,"
356,00:18:16.37,00:18:16.37,and it was actually visiting a hospital
357,00:18:18.40,00:18:18.40,in a village here in Kenya called Wamba.
358,00:18:22.53,00:18:22.53,And our visit was going to be to deliver
359,00:18:25.57,00:18:25.57,"a year's worth of supplies,"
360,00:18:27.47,00:18:27.47,especially for all of their AIDS testing.
361,00:18:33.67,00:18:33.67,I'm out here spending all this time playing this game
362,00:18:35.90,00:18:35.90," Survivor, focusing on nothing but,"
363,00:18:38.23,00:18:38.23,without realizing now that I haven't even
364,00:18:40.40,00:18:40.40,"really thought about, ironically, what the word"
365,00:18:43.37,00:18:43.37,"""survivor"" and what the word ""survive"" means."
366,00:18:46.07,00:18:46.07,And this is the perfect situation
367,00:18:47.53,00:18:47.53,to just remind me of that.
368,00:18:52.60,00:18:52.60,"It's a little hospital, in this little village,"
369,00:18:55.67,00:18:55.67,in the middle of Kenya.
370,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,People come from all over.
371,00:19:02.53,00:19:02.53,Jambo!
372,00:19:04.17,00:19:04.17,"Wow, this is cool."
373,00:19:06.10,00:19:06.10,What a cool place.
374,00:19:07.77,00:19:07.77,"- There's the doctor, straight ahead."
375,00:19:15.77,00:19:15.77,"Dr. Prandoni, good to see you."
376,00:19:18.83,00:19:18.83,"- Welcome. - Welcome, thank you."
377,00:19:20.73,00:19:20.73,This is Lex.
378,00:19:21.87,00:19:21.87,He has a very special delivery for you.
379,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40,- Jambo.
380,00:19:25.53,00:19:25.53,"This old Italian gentleman, this doctor,"
381,00:19:27.60,00:19:27.60,has dedicated his entire lifetime
382,00:19:30.03,00:19:30.03,to helping people here in Africa.
383,00:19:32.50,00:19:32.50,This guy does it simply out of the goodness of his own heart
384,00:19:35.07,00:19:35.07,and has single-handedly mobilized and inspired
385,00:19:38.13,00:19:38.13,enough people to create a completely self-sufficient
386,00:19:41.47,00:19:41.47,hospital in the middle of nowhere.
387,00:19:45.13,00:19:45.13,"- We have test kits, nevirapine,"
388,00:19:47.27,00:19:47.27,which I know you need.
389,00:19:48.43,00:19:48.43,- Thank you. - You are so welcome.
390,00:19:50.30,00:19:50.30,"It's our honor, our pleasure. - You're amazing."
391,00:19:53.30,00:19:53.30,- Here comes the rest of it now.
392,00:19:57.63,00:19:57.63,Come on back here.
393,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,- We are delivering all these medical supplies
394,00:20:01.77,00:20:01.77,that they're in desperate need of.
395,00:20:03.13,00:20:03.13,"I mean, they're running on fumes at that hospital as it is,"
396,00:20:05.87,00:20:05.87,and we are also going to provide them
397,00:20:07.70,00:20:07.70,with a new drug that allows pregnant women
398,00:20:11.90,00:20:11.90,"who have H.I.V. to have children, and the children"
399,00:20:15.57,00:20:15.57,have a better-than-50% chance of being born without H.I.V.
400,00:20:18.40,00:20:18.40,"Whereas, if they didn't get this medication,"
401,00:20:20.67,00:20:20.67,they would probably be born H.I.V.-positive.
402,00:20:29.37,00:20:29.37,"We got a tour of the pediatric ward,"
403,00:20:31.43,00:20:31.43,which was both heart-breaking and just inspirational.
404,00:20:38.53,00:20:38.53,"You've got these little kids, almost all of them orphans."
405,00:20:43.40,00:20:43.40,"I got to actually pass out toys,"
406,00:20:45.67,00:20:45.67,"which, you know, is always a good time."
407,00:20:50.20,00:20:50.20,I got to play with these kids.
408,00:20:52.10,00:20:52.10,They made me miss the hell out of my kids.
409,00:20:54.13,00:20:54.13,Bye-bye.
410,00:20:57.70,00:20:57.70,"You walk out of there, after spending a day"
411,00:21:01.57,00:21:01.57,"checking out the hospital, talking to the doctors,"
412,00:21:03.77,00:21:03.77,"seeing all of this stuff face-to-face,"
413,00:21:05.07,00:21:05.07,I walked away a changed person.
414,00:21:07.40,00:21:07.40,"Doctor, it was a great pleasure, thank you again."
415,00:21:09.33,00:21:09.33,- The pleasure was mine.
416,00:21:15.50,00:21:15.50,See you.
417,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,- The gift I take away from here is he's planted a small seed
418,00:21:19.77,00:21:19.77,in me and I'm going to take that home with me.
419,00:21:34.73,00:21:34.73,- Today there's a little bit of animosity
420,00:21:36.67,00:21:36.67,towards Lex on winning that truck.
421,00:21:39.07,00:21:39.07,I had a lot of people asking me about my alliance
422,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,and trying to change things.
423,00:21:47.07,00:21:47.07,"The second thing, the three of us had alliance"
424,00:21:48.93,00:21:48.93,"and then, they never told me nobody else was in it."
425,00:21:51.07,00:21:51.07,- Right. - Anybody that was good--
426,00:21:53.47,00:21:53.47,"was good to me, I've tried to take care of 'em."
427,00:21:55.80,00:21:55.80,And I've tried to use my personal judgment
428,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,on how far I thought they ought to go.
429,00:22:02.10,00:22:02.10,- (whispering) We don't want to get this far
430,00:22:04.23,00:22:04.23,and have it be Lex and Tommy.
431,00:22:08.23,00:22:08.23,"I mean, you've come too far to have that happen to you."
432,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,I'm absolutely trying to work a deal.
433,00:22:13.27,00:22:13.27,"You guys get rid of me, okay, there's the three of you."
434,00:22:15.43,00:22:15.43,"With that in mind, I know all these guys"
435,00:22:17.60,00:22:17.60,don't really want to come down to the threesome.
436,00:22:19.50,00:22:19.50,They're all skeptical of each other.
437,00:22:21.87,00:22:21.87,"My dilemma then, at this point, with my immunity at stake,"
438,00:22:26.10,00:22:26.10,is to figure out which of the guys
439,00:22:28.83,00:22:28.83,is feeling the most vulnerable.
440,00:22:30.63,00:22:30.63,Which one is the best one to try to approach
441,00:22:33.40,00:22:33.40,with some type of scenario.
442,00:22:36.07,00:22:36.07,(whispering) If you don't eliminate one of those two
443,00:22:38.43,00:22:38.43,"tomorrow, you have to eliminate one of those two the next time."
444,00:22:41.73,00:22:41.73,"- Yeah, I know that. - And you have to decide."
445,00:22:44.10,00:22:44.10,"- Today, Kim approached me and she's like,"
446,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,"""You got to get Lex off."""
447,00:22:48.30,00:22:48.30,"She's like, ""If you don't get Lex off,"
448,00:22:49.40,00:22:49.40,"you're shooting yourself in the foot."""
449,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,- Hello.
450,00:22:54.80,00:22:54.80,- We thought maybe you had gone out
451,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17,for steak dinner in addition.
452,00:22:57.70,00:22:57.70,"- No, no. - No such luck?"
453,00:22:59.73,00:22:59.73,- I was gone most of the day.
454,00:23:01.17,00:23:01.17,"When I got back, the vibe was thick at camp."
455,00:23:04.67,00:23:04.67,- How was it? - So pull up a chair.
456,00:23:06.17,00:23:06.17,- It was heavy.
457,00:23:07.73,00:23:07.73,It was really heavy.
458,00:23:09.73,00:23:09.73,And so we...
459,00:23:12.93,00:23:12.93,Everyone else in the tribe was bummed about the fact
460,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,that they lost and didn't win.
461,00:23:16.73,00:23:16.73,"They've got patients from Ethiopia, Somalia, Mogadishu."
462,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63,"Everyone was nervous,"
463,00:23:22.00,00:23:22.00,and no one really wanted to talk about anything.
464,00:23:24.37,00:23:24.37,"So, anyway, we got there and there's this old doctor there."
465,00:23:28.27,00:23:28.27,There was some strange stuff going down.
466,00:23:30.80,00:23:30.80,The mojo was just funky.
467,00:23:37.60,00:23:37.60,"- He's healthy, he's been eating normally."
468,00:23:40.23,00:23:40.23,He's been out of the camp five more days than I have.
469,00:23:42.77,00:23:42.77,"You know, he's riding on confidence."
470,00:23:45.47,00:23:45.47,It's tough to be at the top of your game
471,00:23:47.97,00:23:47.97,when someone else has all that--
472,00:23:49.20,00:23:49.20,all those added ingredients.
473,00:23:50.97,00:23:50.97,- (whispering) I would absolutely not say the mood
474,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,around here was all pissed off.
475,00:23:53.83,00:23:53.83,"If anything, it was like,"
476,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,"you know, here we are-- just jealousy."
477,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,- It just gets hard not to feel very vulnerable.
478,00:24:01.27,00:24:01.27,"- Good morning, Tommy."
479,00:24:02.70,00:24:02.70,(Tom muttering)
480,00:24:05.23,00:24:05.23,- Tommy on several occasions has tried to get Lex voted off.
481,00:24:09.53,00:24:09.53,"He actually told Teresa that Lex should be the next one to go,"
482,00:24:13.67,00:24:13.67,unbeknownst to Lex or Ethan.
483,00:24:16.40,00:24:16.40,"And he came to me and said that if I have an opportunity,"
484,00:24:21.53,00:24:21.53,"it would be a good thing to vote off Lex,"
485,00:24:22.93,00:24:22.93,but he didn't want to know anything about it.
486,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,- You know what?
487,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37,- What?
488,00:24:36.57,00:24:36.57,"- We made an alliance, we got to stick with it."
489,00:24:39.80,00:24:39.80,"What will be, will be."
490,00:24:42.37,00:24:42.37,And I don't know no other way.
491,00:24:45.30,00:24:45.30,"- Well, the other way is what we said-- we get Lex off."
492,00:24:48.53,00:24:48.53,- He's going to be hard to beat in immunity.
493,00:24:50.43,00:24:50.43,"- Oh, yeah. - 'Cause he's strong."
494,00:24:53.50,00:24:53.50,"- I mean, doesn't the thought of him winning again"
495,00:24:55.27,00:24:55.27,piss you off?
496,00:24:57.17,00:24:57.17,I came into this game with the attitude of winning
497,00:25:01.10,00:25:01.10,"the whole thing, and to do it in a fair way"
498,00:25:04.73,00:25:04.73,and to do it beating the best people
499,00:25:07.27,00:25:07.27,and going against the best head-to-head.
500,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,"- (whispering) Until today, I don't think either of them"
501,00:25:15.70,00:25:15.70,realized how much of a threat he was.
502,00:25:18.23,00:25:18.23,Ethan included.
503,00:25:19.33,00:25:19.33,"Ethan's like, pissed now, you know?"
504,00:25:20.90,00:25:20.90,"- All of you want him gone, but nobody wants to do it."
505,00:25:23.80,00:25:23.80,Kim said today that she knows that the guys
506,00:25:27.33,00:25:27.33,"have got such a strong alliance, that she is the next to go."
507,00:25:29.43,00:25:29.43,"I'm thinking to myself, ""Good for you."
508,00:25:31.67,00:25:31.67,"Good for you, you're finally thinking."""
509,00:25:33.37,00:25:33.37,- You'd rather go against Tom.
510,00:25:35.07,00:25:35.07,"- He's always wanted to got rid of Lex,"
511,00:25:36.37,00:25:36.37,he just wouldn't do it.
512,00:25:37.60,00:25:37.60,"And I said, ""What if Lex doesn't get immunity?"""
513,00:25:40.40,00:25:40.40,and I can get Tom to vote Lex off?
514,00:25:42.37,00:25:42.37,And she said then she'd do that.
515,00:25:44.13,00:25:44.13,She said it's not too early now to do that.
516,00:25:45.70,00:25:45.70,"And I'm thinking, ""Well, hey, she's waking up a little bit."""
517,00:26:10.63,00:26:10.63,"- Well, ain't that nice."
518,00:26:14.10,00:26:14.10,What the hell is it?
519,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"A tisket, a tasket, I found something in the basket."
520,00:26:19.93,00:26:19.93,- And look at what you found.
521,00:26:21.30,00:26:21.30,- And look what I found.
522,00:26:23.00,00:26:23.00,Pretty little basket.
523,00:26:25.17,00:26:25.17,Okay.
524,00:26:26.70,00:26:26.70,"""Things are always easier second time around."
525,00:26:29.83,00:26:29.83,"""You are about to find out if it's as true as it sounds."
526,00:26:32.90,00:26:32.90,"""With the final four pending, you don't want to lose,"
527,00:26:36.27,00:26:36.27,"or at the Tribal Council it could be you that they choose."""
528,00:26:43.57,00:26:43.57,This was in there.
529,00:26:45.27,00:26:45.27,I don't know if that has anything to do--
530,00:26:46.67,00:26:46.67,I thought it was a damn snake.
531,00:26:48.00,00:26:48.00,- What are those?
532,00:26:49.47,00:26:49.47,- Shells or beads. - They're seeds.
533,00:26:51.30,00:26:51.30,- This immunity challenge coming up
534,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27,is certainly going to be the most important for me.
535,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,- What's that got to do with it?
536,00:26:56.97,00:26:56.97,- I don't know.
537,00:26:58.37,00:26:58.37,"- I'm the last Samburu left, so it would be easy for them"
538,00:27:00.70,00:27:00.70,right now just to go ahead and move me out.
539,00:27:02.77,00:27:02.77,- Or maybe it's something totally different
540,00:27:06.97,00:27:06.97,and you got to run through something twice.
541,00:27:08.77,00:27:08.77,"- Whatever it is, I gotta give it all I've got."
542,00:27:34.47,00:27:34.47,"- Hello, you guys can go ahead and fall in."
543,00:27:37.90,00:27:37.90,"All right, first things first, Big Tom."
544,00:27:39.87,00:27:39.87,"Give it up, baby."
545,00:27:41.17,00:27:41.17,- I hate to.
546,00:27:42.67,00:27:42.67,"Uh-oh, my nose is a little large."
547,00:27:44.47,00:27:44.47,"You want to unbutton that, will you?"
548,00:27:45.63,00:27:45.63,- Let me unhook that for you.
549,00:27:46.70,00:27:46.70,- Thank you. - All right.
550,00:27:47.73,00:27:47.73,- I hate to see it go.
551,00:27:52.00,00:27:52.00,- Immunity is back up for grabs.
552,00:27:54.27,00:27:54.27,"Today's challenge, obviously a big one."
553,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,One of the qualities required to do well
554,00:27:59.23,00:27:59.23,in this game of Survivor  is the ability
555,00:28:01.40,00:28:01.40,to learn from past mistakes.
556,00:28:03.60,00:28:03.60,Today you're gonna get a second chance
557,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,at elements from previous challenges.
558,00:28:08.13,00:28:08.13,"Some are physical, some are mental."
559,00:28:10.53,00:28:10.53,"To win it, you'll have to do well at all of them."
560,00:28:13.33,00:28:13.33,It starts with a puzzle ladder.
561,00:28:15.93,00:28:15.93,Assemble the puzzle.
562,00:28:17.23,00:28:17.23,Use it to make your way up to the net.
563,00:28:18.67,00:28:18.67,"Go up one side of the net, down the other."
564,00:28:21.30,00:28:21.30,"You'll find a cart, contains pieces to a puzzle."
565,00:28:24.10,00:28:24.10,Drag the cart over to your puzzle platform
566,00:28:26.87,00:28:26.87,and assemble the puzzle.
567,00:28:28.13,00:28:28.13,You'll then make your way under the ladder crawl
568,00:28:30.33,00:28:30.33,to your bow and arrows.
569,00:28:31.90,00:28:31.90,First person to hit their target with an arrow
570,00:28:34.00,00:28:34.00,wins immunity.
571,00:28:35.13,00:28:35.13,Obviously this is a big challenge.
572,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,"Win this, you're in the final four."
573,00:28:39.73,00:28:39.73,You guys are all strong competitors.
574,00:28:41.77,00:28:41.77,This is game day.
575,00:28:42.90,00:28:42.90,"Take your positions, wait for my start."
576,00:28:48.70,00:28:48.70,"Here we go, immunity at stake."
577,00:28:50.73,00:28:50.73,Survivors ready?
578,00:28:52.53,00:28:52.53,Go!
579,00:29:18.13,00:29:18.13,(Tom groans)
580,00:29:22.37,00:29:22.37,- You guys are all pretty even.
581,00:29:24.33,00:29:24.33,All four pins in.
582,00:29:48.80,00:29:48.80,"That a way, Big Tom, you're in it."
583,00:29:50.23,00:29:50.23,You're in it!
584,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,"That a way, K.J."
585,00:30:01.80,00:30:01.80,You guys are doing great.
586,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,You're all very even.
587,00:30:09.07,00:30:09.07,"Playing smart, you're thinking, not panicking."
588,00:30:14.23,00:30:14.23,"That a way, Kim."
589,00:30:31.67,00:30:31.67,"That's good, Lex is done."
590,00:30:43.07,00:30:43.07,Lex is on his last leg.
591,00:30:50.53,00:30:50.53,There it is!
592,00:30:55.60,00:30:55.60,"Nice shot, congratulations."
593,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,( laughs )
594,00:31:04.07,00:31:04.07,- Yeah!
595,00:31:10.17,00:31:10.17,"- Lex, after a temporary vacation,"
596,00:31:12.80,00:31:12.80,evidently it likes this home a little better.
597,00:31:16.27,00:31:16.27,"Congratulations. - Thank you, Jeff."
598,00:31:17.53,00:31:17.53,"- Immunity tonight, you are safe."
599,00:31:19.27,00:31:19.27,"The other four, somebody's going home."
600,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,Give you guys the afternoon to think about it.
601,00:31:23.93,00:31:23.93,I'll see you at Tribal Council.
602,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,"- I feel close enough to you, that I know"
603,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,we're going to see each other more.
604,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,We're going to talk.
605,00:31:55.10,00:31:55.10,- T. Bird approached me before Tribal Council
606,00:31:57.53,00:31:57.53,and obviously needed to have a heart-to-heart.
607,00:31:59.47,00:31:59.47,She is the odd person out at this point.
608,00:32:01.67,00:32:01.67,She's the only person that's left
609,00:32:03.63,00:32:03.63,that's from the original Samburu.
610,00:32:05.50,00:32:05.50,"Um, she's in a mess of hurt."
611,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,Somehow we worked it out to where everyone that's left
612,00:32:12.20,00:32:12.20,is a sweet person.
613,00:32:14.70,00:32:14.70,- Mm-hmm.
614,00:32:15.83,00:32:15.83,"For me, it's I guess kind of bittersweet."
615,00:32:18.43,00:32:18.43,I know that I'm going to be the next one to go
616,00:32:19.93,00:32:19.93,unless I can think of something real quick.
617,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,Just watch yourself.
618,00:32:25.43,00:32:25.43,"Because even with alliances, people have their own agendas."
619,00:32:30.47,00:32:30.47,"- I know, I know."
620,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,- I had thought of every different way I could play it.
621,00:32:34.17,00:32:34.17,"And unfortunately, with Lex getting immunity,"
622,00:32:36.37,00:32:36.37,"that cut down a lot of my options,"
623,00:32:38.23,00:32:38.23,"and I really only had one option to go,"
624,00:32:40.47,00:32:40.47,and that was with trying to get Lex
625,00:32:43.33,00:32:43.33,and Kim Johnson to vote off Tom.
626,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,"When I came over to this tribe,"
627,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,a little birdie whispered something in my ear.
628,00:32:50.37,00:32:50.37,"- T. Bird is obviously struggling with something,"
629,00:32:52.37,00:32:52.37,"and so she said, ""I need you to sit down."
630,00:32:54.63,00:32:54.63,"""I have something I need to confess to you."
631,00:32:56.07,00:32:56.07,"""I have something before we go to Tribal Council"
632,00:32:57.90,00:32:57.90,"I need to tell you."""
633,00:32:59.60,00:32:59.60,"- Knowing pretty sure I was gone,"
634,00:33:01.97,00:33:01.97,"I thought I don't have anything to lose, anyway,"
635,00:33:03.77,00:33:03.77,I'll go ahead and let him know that I was the one
636,00:33:06.03,00:33:06.03,that put the vote against Lex.
637,00:33:08.97,00:33:08.97,"- And she said, you know, ""When you got that one mystery vote,"""
638,00:33:12.37,00:33:12.37,"who at the time I thought might be Kelly,"
639,00:33:13.90,00:33:13.90,"""I was the one that cast that vote for you."""
640,00:33:17.37,00:33:17.37,- The reason I changed my vote was because before we left
641,00:33:21.23,00:33:21.23,"for Tribal Council, when we were in here,"
642,00:33:24.53,00:33:24.53,"somebody came up and whispered to me, ""Watch out for Lex."""
643,00:33:28.33,00:33:28.33,- Who told you to watch out for me?
644,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,- I can't tell you.
645,00:33:31.70,00:33:31.70,"- Well, I sincerely hope it was Kelly."
646,00:33:34.03,00:33:34.03,"I said, well, there's not more than a couple people"
647,00:33:36.07,00:33:36.07,that it could be because you're telling me to watch my back.
648,00:33:38.70,00:33:38.70,Did Tom tell you not to trust me?
649,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,"I mean, that's the only person I can think of"
650,00:33:44.57,00:33:44.57,"that just, it all fits."
651,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,And she just looked at me and went like this.
652,00:33:50.73,00:33:50.73,I don't understand.
653,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"In telling her that, Tom is basically giving her"
654,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,a green light that I was the right person to vote for.
655,00:33:58.83,00:33:58.83,I just don't get it.
656,00:34:00.10,00:34:00.10,"And I also found out, you know, at that point,"
657,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,Mama Cat told me that she had also been approached
658,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27,by Tom on more than one occasion.
659,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,"- He said, you know, ""If you vote Lex off,"
660,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,"""you know, it would be good if you did it,"
661,00:34:10.07,00:34:10.07,"""but don't let me know anything about it."
662,00:34:11.50,00:34:11.50,"I don't want to know about it, but it'd be a good thing to do."""
663,00:34:13.53,00:34:13.53,"And I said, if you want him off so bad, let him vote him off."
664,00:34:15.50,00:34:15.50,- It's a pity.
665,00:34:16.77,00:34:16.77,"- Tom wants Lex off, but he says ""I can't vote him,"""
666,00:34:19.57,00:34:19.57,"so he wants everybody else to do the dirty work for him,"
667,00:34:22.57,00:34:22.57,so he still looks like the good guy.
668,00:34:24.37,00:34:24.37,- How many people on the jury know that side of him?
669,00:34:29.13,00:34:29.13,- Nobody. - Nobody.
670,00:34:30.27,00:34:30.27,"- No. - Well, that's a problem."
671,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,That's why I-- that's why I'd have a hard time
672,00:34:36.17,00:34:36.17,going up against him.
673,00:34:37.30,00:34:37.30,- Well...
674,00:34:39.37,00:34:39.37,"- Well, I appreciate your telling me."
675,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,- Thanks for telling me.
676,00:34:42.53,00:34:42.53,- All right.
677,00:34:47.03,00:34:47.03,"- Well, it just got way more-- way more sinister."
678,00:34:51.27,00:34:51.27,- Tommy's sort of insular in his thinking.
679,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,Tommy's looking out for Tommy most of the time.
680,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,"Whatever Tommy wants to do, Tommy does,"
681,00:34:57.37,00:34:57.37,regardless of its effect on other people.
682,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,"- I don't, but thank you."
683,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"Ultimately, I am responsible for myself and nobody else."
684,00:35:07.47,00:35:07.47,It's completely gone to cutthroat mode.
685,00:35:09.73,00:35:09.73,"And if I think that Tom, if I think that he's in a situation"
686,00:35:12.60,00:35:12.60,"where he is about to screw me over and stab me in the back,"
687,00:35:14.93,00:35:14.93,I'll cut his throat.
688,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,- We'll now bring in our jury.
689,00:36:12.37,00:36:12.37,Up to four members now.
690,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,"Well, I gotta call attention to something I just noticed"
691,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,"when the jury walked in, which is the shirt"
692,00:36:32.40,00:36:32.40,that Kelly's wearing.
693,00:36:34.27,00:36:34.27,"""Shameless,"" which I can only imagine"
694,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,is referring back to last Tribal Council
695,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,when the whole notion of the Walk of Shame came up.
696,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43,Is that what you guys feel as a group?
697,00:36:43.43,00:36:43.43,Is it a Walk of Shame?
698,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,- That was actually a term that was coined
699,00:36:47.77,00:36:47.77,a long time ago and was kind of the common term
700,00:36:50.13,00:36:50.13,that we all used around the camp anyway.
701,00:36:52.87,00:36:52.87,"It has nothing to do with that being a shameful place to be,"
702,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,that there being any shame in being voted off
703,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,or being out of the tribe.
704,00:37:01.53,00:37:01.53,It was just a term we all kind of coined and used freely
705,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,without really thinking about what somebody
706,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,might interpret it as.
707,00:37:09.57,00:37:09.57,"- Big Tom, does it make you more aware"
708,00:37:12.33,00:37:12.33,"of what you are saying, knowing the jury is listening,"
709,00:37:14.23,00:37:14.23,or was that just not a big deal
710,00:37:16.17,00:37:16.17,and you should be blunt about it.
711,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"- It probably ought to be a big deal,"
712,00:37:19.60,00:37:19.60,but every one of them on that jury knows me.
713,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"And they know if it comes through my brain,"
714,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,"it'll come out my mouth, and I--"
715,00:37:26.57,00:37:26.57,I'm too old to change now.
716,00:37:28.90,00:37:28.90,I'm not going to change for them or these or you.
717,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,"I'm whom I am, and that's it."
718,00:37:35.57,00:37:35.57,"No, I'm going to say whatever comes out"
719,00:37:39.10,00:37:39.10,and I'll stand by it.
720,00:37:40.43,00:37:40.43,"- Ethan, how acute are your senses now"
721,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,after being out with no distractions
722,00:37:46.23,00:37:46.23,for over a month in Africa?
723,00:37:49.20,00:37:49.20,"- Well, you know, just not as sharp."
724,00:37:51.30,00:37:51.30,"You know, mentally you're not as sharp,"
725,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,"and you know, you trip over things"
726,00:37:55.10,00:37:55.10,that you weren't tripping over before.
727,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,"You know, now that I'm laying on the ground, I'm thin."
728,00:37:58.97,00:37:58.97,"You feel the ground more than ever, you know."
729,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,"Your ribs are sticking into the earth, so in terms of that."
730,00:38:05.70,00:38:05.70,But mentally I'm not sharp--
731,00:38:08.33,00:38:08.33,as sharp anymore.
732,00:38:09.87,00:38:09.87,"I'm just, you know, it's tough."
733,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,It wears on you.
734,00:38:13.43,00:38:13.43,"You know, you're tired all the time,"
735,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,you're hungry all the time.
736,00:38:16.07,00:38:16.07,"You're-- you know, so in that sense,"
737,00:38:18.40,00:38:18.40,I think some of my acuteness has gone far away.
738,00:38:21.53,00:38:21.53,"- Teresa, I gotta bring up,"
739,00:38:22.83,00:38:22.83,you're the last of the original Samburu.
740,00:38:26.13,00:38:26.13,- I was hoping you wouldn't notice that.
741,00:38:28.13,00:38:28.13,"Actually, I was hoping  they wouldn't notice that."
742,00:38:31.80,00:38:31.80,"- Well, do you think they haven't?"
743,00:38:33.10,00:38:33.10,"- Yeah, they've noticed it."
744,00:38:34.40,00:38:34.40,"You know, I feel like I was lucky to be brought"
745,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,"into the old Boran tribe earlier than the merge,"
746,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,"so I got to know, especially Ethan and Kim."
747,00:38:46.13,00:38:46.13,"You know, I never thought I'd get to this point."
748,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,I never thought I'd make the final five.
749,00:38:52.00,00:38:52.00,"- All right, we're going to vote in a minute."
750,00:38:53.13,00:38:53.13,"Before we do, one final question,"
751,00:38:54.60,00:38:54.60,"Tom, know who you're voting for tonight?"
752,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,- Mm-hmm. - And do you have a game plan
753,00:38:57.03,00:38:57.03,from here on out?
754,00:38:58.20,00:38:58.20,"- I might be that one gets voted off tonight,"
755,00:39:00.20,00:39:00.20,so you can't make a game plan till after this thing's over.
756,00:39:03.80,00:39:03.80,I might-- I've got my bags packed like everybody else.
757,00:39:07.37,00:39:07.37,You don't know in this game when you're going
758,00:39:09.57,00:39:09.57,or when you're coming.
759,00:39:10.80,00:39:10.80,So I'm going-- I'll just wait till it gets closer
760,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,and see what happens after tonight.
761,00:39:15.57,00:39:15.57,"- Okay, it's time to vote."
762,00:39:16.77,00:39:16.77,K.J. you're up first.
763,00:39:32.70,00:39:32.70,"- T. Bird, you've been a good friend"
764,00:39:34.80,00:39:34.80,and you've been my pleasure.
765,00:39:37.63,00:39:37.63,Keep that wonderful smile
766,00:39:38.90,00:39:38.90,'cause you are an awful good girl.
767,00:39:42.47,00:39:42.47,See you around.
768,00:39:55.03,00:39:55.03,"- It's with a heavy heart that I cast this vote for you,"
769,00:39:57.63,00:39:57.63,a really heavy heart.
770,00:40:15.73,00:40:15.73,- I'll go tally the votes.
771,00:40:35.90,00:40:35.90,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final."
772,00:40:38.27,00:40:38.27,Person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
773,00:40:39.87,00:40:39.87,immediately.
774,00:40:41.00,00:40:41.00,I'll read the votes.
775,00:40:45.47,00:40:45.47,"First vote, T. Bird."
776,00:40:48.63,00:40:48.63,"It's you, Teresa."
777,00:40:56.43,00:40:56.43,"T. Bird, that's two for Teresa."
778,00:41:07.67,00:41:07.67,"Three votes, that's enough."
779,00:41:09.27,00:41:09.27,No need to read the other two.
780,00:41:10.53,00:41:10.53,You need to bring your torch.
781,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,- The fat lady's singing?
782,00:41:13.67,00:41:13.67,Afraid so.
783,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,"- Teresa, the tribe has spoken."
784,00:41:35.00,00:41:35.00,It's time for you to go.
785,00:41:36.50,00:41:36.50,- Bye.
786,00:41:45.67,00:41:45.67,"- Well, here's what this game has come down to."
787,00:41:48.63,00:41:48.63,"Four people, three days, two immunity challenges,"
788,00:41:54.10,00:41:54.10,one Survivor.
789,00:41:55.30,00:41:55.30,You guys can head back to camp.
790,00:41:57.10,00:41:57.10,I will see you tomorrow.
791,00:42:21.23,00:42:21.23,- This has been an absolute experience of a lifetime.
792,00:42:25.13,00:42:25.13,I never dreamed I'd make it
793,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93,"to be one of the 16 survivors,"
794,00:42:28.87,00:42:28.87,much less be one of the five remaining survivors.
795,00:42:31.47,00:42:31.47,"It's something I will, of course, never forget."
796,00:42:33.30,00:42:33.30,I appreciate having the opportunity to be here
797,00:42:35.13,00:42:35.13,and to experience everything here in Africa.
798,00:42:37.87,00:42:37.87,Thank you for a wonderful experience.
