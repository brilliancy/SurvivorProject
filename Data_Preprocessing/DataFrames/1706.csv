5,00:00:11.08,00:00:11.08,"yours. The entire tribe was united,"
6,00:00:14.88,00:00:14.88,except for Dan and Susie. >> I don't have the confidence
7,00:00:18.04,00:00:18.04,that we get to the merge and these people have got my back.
8,00:00:22.38,00:00:22.38,">> PROBST: Throughout the game, the red tribe, Fang,"
9,00:00:25.17,00:00:25.17,consistently made questionable moves.
10,00:00:27.21,00:00:27.21,>> I'm stuck in a tribe that has no skills.
11,00:00:28.71,00:00:28.71,>> PROBST: Ace made a heads-up play...
12,00:00:30.12,00:00:30.12,>> That's the deal. >> Deal?
13,00:00:32.00,00:00:32.00,>> Deal. >> PROBST: ...when he pulled
14,00:00:33.42,00:00:33.42,"Matty into an alliance with his long-time ally, Sugar."
15,00:00:36.21,00:00:36.21,>> I've been relying on Ace the whole time.
16,00:00:38.54,00:00:38.54,>> One of Sugar's biggest plusses is the fact that she has
17,00:00:41.04,00:00:41.04,the immunity idol. And I've got Sugar in my pocket.
18,00:00:44.12,00:00:44.12,">> PROBST: Their first move was to vote out Ace's biggest enemy,"
19,00:00:47.12,00:00:47.12,"Kelly. Kelly, the tribe has spoken."
20,00:00:50.46,00:00:50.46,12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

22,00:01:04.38,00:01:04.38,(animal squawks in distance) >> This is a tough game.
23,00:01:12.96,00:01:12.96,We're starving. >> There's nothing to eat.
24,00:01:21.79,00:01:21.79,"I'm starting to lose my spirit, I'm starting to lose my hope."
25,00:01:26.25,00:01:26.25,It's-it's become hopeless. I'm hopeless about Fang.
26,00:01:33.21,00:01:33.21,">> What happened? >> As soon as I got up, it"
27,00:01:36.04,00:01:36.04,tipped over. But just a little bit came out.
28,00:01:39.04,00:01:39.04,"But I'll scoop it back in there, 'cause it... it was just a"
29,00:01:41.83,00:01:41.83,little bit. >> That's a ton.
30,00:01:44.38,00:01:44.38,"Rice is more valuable than gold, and she just clumsily trips over"
31,00:01:48.62,00:01:48.62,it and spills it. I wanted to just lay into her
32,00:01:52.21,00:01:52.21,"and chew her out, but I... it's just pointless."
33,00:01:54.96,00:01:54.96,"You can't cry over spilled milk, you know?"
34,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,It's just too late. Is it done?
35,00:02:05.67,00:02:05.67,>> Yeah. Not so bad. >> You guys ready?
36,00:02:11.04,00:02:11.04,>> Nothing like some fresh oatmeal rice.
37,00:02:20.92,00:02:20.92,>> I don't want to take away from you and Matty.
38,00:02:22.67,00:02:22.67,">> Crystal, eat. >> Ace, you eat."
39,00:02:26.21,00:02:26.21,">> Come on, please? >> You don't have to beg me."
40,00:02:29.04,00:02:29.04,You eat. I don't want to feel like I took
41,00:02:31.83,00:02:31.83,"away from anybody in this tribe. So by all means, eat your full,"
42,00:02:35.92,00:02:35.92,"like you normally do. >> This tribe, Fang tribe, we're"
43,00:02:40.12,00:02:40.12,not working together. Everybody has grudges against
44,00:02:42.04,00:02:42.04,each other. Matty and Ace are basically
45,00:02:45.25,00:02:45.25,going against Crystal. These guys are trying to call
46,00:02:47.12,00:02:47.12,"the shots, and I don't like that, I don't like that at all."
47,00:02:50.12,00:02:50.12,">> You guys don't have to say anything, but your faces say a"
48,00:02:52.33,00:02:52.33,thousand words. That's the difference between me
49,00:02:54.25,00:02:54.25,and you guys. >> Crystal did me a favor.
50,00:02:58.25,00:02:58.25,She will be the next lamb to the slaughter.

59,00:04:05.04,00:04:05.04,And I'm just the type of person that I'm always gonna feel a
60,00:04:08.04,00:04:08.04,"little bit vulnerable, a little bit insecure."
61,00:04:10.12,00:04:10.12,"I mean, I wanted to clarify that I'm, like, a really sensitive"
62,00:04:12.92,00:04:12.92,person. >> Yeah.
63,00:04:14.25,00:04:14.25,>> And it's weird when I'm not part of a group.
64,00:04:16.33,00:04:16.33,"I kind of, like... it-it, like, makes me feel bad a little bit."
65,00:04:20.12,00:04:20.12,"That's just me, like, that's how I am with groups."
66,00:04:22.38,00:04:22.38,">> Yeah. Yeah. >> You know, I like to be part"
67,00:04:25.17,00:04:25.17,of the group. >> I would say that Dan is
68,00:04:27.25,00:04:27.25,socially inept in a lot of ways. I don't know if he's a former
69,00:04:30.54,00:04:30.54,"fatty or why he wasn't liked as a child, but deep down inside"
70,00:04:33.88,00:04:33.88,he's a little kid that's seeking approval.
71,00:04:36.33,00:04:36.33,">> It's different than Fang, where I alienated myself because"
72,00:04:38.75,00:04:38.75,"I didn't like those people. With you guys, it's completely"
73,00:04:40.79,00:04:40.79,"opposite. It's, like, all right, I really"
74,00:04:43.12,00:04:43.12,like these three... >> Dan is the ultimate paranoid
75,00:04:45.67,00:04:45.67,"human being. At some point, Dan is gonna be a"
76,00:04:49.00,00:04:49.00,"huge liability, and unfortunately, there's nothing I"
77,00:04:52.00,00:04:52.00,can do to-to sort of save him from-from himself at this point.
78,00:04:55.67,00:04:55.67,">> Do you feel better? >> Yeah, I do."
79,00:04:57.38,00:04:57.38,>> Okay. >> Do you guys?
80,00:04:58.96,00:04:58.96,>> Yeah. >> All right. Good.

89,00:05:32.62,00:05:32.62,attempts to smash that ball or force it to the ground.
90,00:05:37.04,00:05:37.04,"You'll be playing at the same time, in two rings."
91,00:05:40.04,00:05:40.04,The tribe whose attacker breaks their opponent's ball first wins
92,00:05:43.08,00:05:43.08,a point. We are playing to three.
93,00:05:45.12,00:05:45.12,Want to know what you're playing for?
94,00:05:47.04,00:05:47.04,">> Yeah. >> Hell, yeah."

112,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,he'll be going up against Kota. Fang looking to break a
113,00:06:41.21,00:06:41.21,"five-challenge losing streak. Survivors, ready..."
114,00:06:47.75,00:06:47.75,Go! Ace goes after Bob in the Kota
115,00:06:52.58,00:06:52.58,ring. Randy very aggressive in the
116,00:06:56.38,00:06:56.38,Fang ring. >> Yes!

123,00:07:15.17,00:07:15.17,He's such an ugly person. He's mean.

127,00:07:29.25,00:07:29.25,"score for Fang. Bob takes Kenny out, doesn't"
128,00:07:33.58,00:07:33.58,help. Fang's still alive.
129,00:07:35.67,00:07:35.67,"Bob takes a hard fall. Stay after him, Sugar."
130,00:07:38.08,00:07:38.08,Be a hero. >> (laughs): Okay.
131,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,">> PROBST: Fang needs to score. Sugar, you need to pick it up."
132,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,Do not drop that ball. >> (grunts)
133,00:07:48.08,00:07:48.08,>> PROBST: Big takedown from Bob!
134,00:07:50.04,00:07:50.04,"It doesn't work, though-- Ace keeps the ball alive."
135,00:07:52.25,00:07:52.25,">> Nice, Ace! >> PROBST: Sugar doing"
136,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,"nothing, absolutely nothing. >> Come on, Sugar!"

138,00:08:03.33,00:08:03.33,something happen. Bob almost deflects it!
139,00:08:07.62,00:08:07.62,No! Another takedown by Bob on Matty!
140,00:08:11.29,00:08:11.29,">> (laughing) >> Come on, Sugar!"

143,00:08:20.08,00:08:20.08,Kota leads: two-zip. We are playing to three.
144,00:08:23.25,00:08:23.25,"This could be it. Next round, attacking for Kota"
145,00:08:26.42,00:08:26.42,is Dan. He could end this challenge.
146,00:08:29.62,00:08:29.62,"Attacking for Fang is Matty, trying to keep Fang alive for a"
147,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,"big reward. Survivors, ready..."
148,00:08:38.75,00:08:38.75,"Go! Matty comes out strong, chasing"
149,00:08:41.79,00:08:41.79,after that ball quickly. Dan very aggressive on Ace.
150,00:08:48.21,00:08:48.21,"Ace gets rid of it to Crystal. Crystal to Sugar, back to Ace."
151,00:08:52.29,00:08:52.29,Ace back to Sugar. No! Dan causes the ball to break!
152,00:08:56.71,00:08:56.71,Kota scores! Kota wins reward!
153,00:08:59.50,00:08:59.50,"(excited chatter) All right, Kota, big decision."
154,00:09:04.62,00:09:04.62,You're sending one member of Fang to Exile Island.
155,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,>> Let's go ahead and send Sugar.
156,00:09:09.12,00:09:09.12,">> PROBST: Sugar, this is unprecedented."
157,00:09:11.21,00:09:11.21,I don't think we've ever had anybody be sent to Exile five
158,00:09:13.96,00:09:13.96,"times, back-to-back-to-back... to-back-to-back."
159,00:09:17.62,00:09:17.62,">> Yeah, I'm here to break records, you know. (laughs)"
160,00:09:20.25,00:09:20.25,">> PROBST: All right, Sugar, get your stuff."
161,00:09:22.96,00:09:22.96,>> Sugar is a pinup model. She is completely worthless when
162,00:09:25.96,00:09:25.96,it comes to challenges. So when it comes to Sugar in
163,00:09:29.54,00:09:29.54,"this game... I would really, really, really desire her to go."
164,00:09:34.25,00:09:34.25,">> PROBST: Kota, it should be a fun afternoon."
165,00:09:36.88,00:09:36.88,"(indistinct chatter) Fang, I got nothing for you."
166,00:09:41.21,00:09:41.21,>> We lost the biggest reward yet.
167,00:09:44.04,00:09:44.04,"It's hard, you know, when you see them walking away."
168,00:09:46.75,00:09:46.75,"They have everything, and we have nothing."
169,00:09:49.96,00:09:49.96,And we see Kota in their beautiful chopper just lavishing
170,00:09:53.58,00:09:53.58,"in their reward, you know? It's madness, it's total"
171,00:09:57.04,00:09:57.04,madness. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
172,00:10:17.58,00:10:17.58,">> Reward was a helicopter ride, and I was lucky enough to have"
173,00:10:21.92,00:10:21.92,the front-row seat. Just seeing that incredible
174,00:10:26.83,00:10:26.83,"crater, it made my trip to Africa."
175,00:10:37.38,00:10:37.38,The only thing that was beating faster than the rotors on that
176,00:10:40.38,00:10:40.38,helicopter was the beating of my heart.
177,00:10:45.12,00:10:45.12,">> Oh, wow. >> Close as I want to get."
178,00:10:46.79,00:10:46.79,>> Holy cow. >> Stay away from the edge.
179,00:10:50.25,00:10:50.25,">> You're making me nervous, Marcus."
180,00:10:52.04,00:10:52.04,"The beautiful scenery, it was awesome."
181,00:10:54.46,00:10:54.46,"It's something I thought I would never experience, so it just"
182,00:10:57.21,00:10:57.21,"gives you more incentive, more power, more strength to know"
183,00:10:59.46,00:10:59.46,"that you can get through this, no matter what."
184,00:11:01.79,00:11:01.79,So it was very... it was very surreal for me.
185,00:11:04.04,00:11:04.04,It was just amazing. >> Let's get our blanket out.
186,00:11:06.25,00:11:06.25,">> This is great, let's get our blanket out."
187,00:11:08.00,00:11:08.00,>> Sardines! Ha-ha! >> I don't think in
188,00:11:22.12,00:11:22.12,my entire 29 years of living I've ever been so embarrassed.
189,00:11:24.96,00:11:24.96,I'm humiliated. I felt pathetic. My spirits are dropping so fast.
190,00:11:30.83,00:11:30.83,"I look over, and, like, Sugar, she's just, she can't do"
191,00:11:35.04,00:11:35.04,anything. She's just being dominated.
192,00:11:37.25,00:11:37.25,It was pointless for us to even keep going.
193,00:11:39.62,00:11:39.62,She was just standing there getting walked all over.
194,00:11:42.12,00:11:42.12,I hate it. I'm starting to get pissed.
195,00:11:45.42,00:11:45.42,"As long as there's physical challenges, we're gonna lose."
196,00:11:48.75,00:11:48.75,"Want to take a boat ride, Ace? >> Sure, bro."
197,00:11:58.04,00:11:58.04,">> We need to take out Sugar. Okay, this is what we do."
198,00:12:01.12,00:12:01.12,"We go Kenny, Crystal and I vote for Sugar."
199,00:12:03.42,00:12:03.42,"You don't have to vote for Sugar, so you're not"
200,00:12:05.83,00:12:05.83,"backstabbing her, okay? Sugar's gone, and it's you and I"
201,00:12:08.04,00:12:08.04,to the merge a hundred percent. There's no question.
202,00:12:10.04,00:12:10.04,">> You know we're a hundred percent, you and me."
203,00:12:12.00,00:12:12.00,">> No, I don't know that. We're aligned."
204,00:12:13.62,00:12:13.62,"Me and you are aligned, so make me comfortable."
205,00:12:16.08,00:12:16.08,We need to take out Sugar or at least get the idol out.
206,00:12:27.29,00:12:27.29,">> Yeah, I see the logic, dude. I see that logic."
207,00:12:29.04,00:12:29.04,">> Okay, we know exactly where it's sitting, and we can use it"
208,00:12:31.79,00:12:31.79,to our advantage when we have to.
209,00:12:36.92,00:12:36.92,">> You know what they're talking about, right, Cri?"
210,00:12:38.75,00:12:38.75,">> Yeah, those two asses out there in the boat trying to get"
211,00:12:40.88,00:12:40.88,me off. >> They are. Will you trust me?
212,00:12:44.46,00:12:44.46,">> I've been there with you from day one, Kenny."
213,00:12:46.67,00:12:46.67,>> We have to blindside Ace. >> Yeah.
214,00:12:48.83,00:12:48.83,">> I have to talk to Sugar. Crystal, you trust me a"
215,00:12:51.33,00:12:51.33,"hundred percent, right? >> I trust you a hundred"
216,00:12:53.12,00:12:53.12,percent. >> Okay.
217,00:12:54.04,00:12:54.04,">> I can feel Ace, right now, strategically, wants to get rid"
218,00:12:57.33,00:12:57.33,of me. The way that he's manipulating
219,00:13:01.38,00:13:01.38,"Matty, he's a devil. And he has to go."
220,00:13:06.17,00:13:06.17,>> This is... this is awesome. >> Getting this is just
221,00:13:09.08,00:13:09.08,incomparable. >> And the best part about this
222,00:13:10.88,00:13:10.88,is they don't get it. >> And they may be completely
223,00:13:13.29,00:13:13.29,"out of rice, to add insult to injury."
224,00:13:18.50,00:13:18.50,">> Oh, oh... >> What is this?"
225,00:13:20.42,00:13:20.42,">> Oh, my... >> Oh, my God!"
226,00:13:26.21,00:13:26.21,">> Wait, stop. Everyone, shh! >> Holy cow, these are letters"
227,00:13:30.21,00:13:30.21,"from home. >> Oh, my God, they're letters!"
228,00:13:32.79,00:13:32.79,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (gasps)"
229,00:13:38.83,00:13:38.83,"Oh, my God! They're really letters!"
230,00:13:42.38,00:13:42.38,">> (sobbing) >> Bob, are you okay, man?"
231,00:13:49.96,00:13:49.96,">> No, I'm not! >> Your family loves you, Bob."
232,00:13:53.67,00:13:53.67,>> I know it. (sobbing) (grunts)
233,00:13:59.00,00:13:59.00,I don't know which one to read first.
234,00:14:01.92,00:14:01.92,"This is from David. >> My dad, he never writes"
235,00:14:08.12,00:14:08.12,"anything, and he wrote me a letter."
236,00:14:09.96,00:14:09.96,>> Isn't that cool? >> He never writes anything.
237,00:14:12.67,00:14:12.67,He wasn't even excited. He didn't show any excitement
238,00:14:15.75,00:14:15.75,when I was leaving. Wow.
239,00:14:20.00,00:14:20.00,">> ""You should receive..."" I can't read it."
240,00:14:22.38,00:14:22.38,"My eyes keep blurring. I'm close to these people here,"
241,00:14:27.17,00:14:27.17,but these are the people that are the closest to my heart.
242,00:14:30.08,00:14:30.08,Life is good. And I realize how lucky a man I
243,00:14:34.04,00:14:34.04,am. I'm here.
244,00:14:36.46,00:14:36.46,And I can't... I can't wait to get home to
245,00:14:38.88,00:14:38.88,them. Life doesn't get better than
246,00:14:41.00,00:14:41.00,this. >> Back to the Sugar Shack
247,00:14:51.79,00:14:51.79,for me. I don't really know what the
248,00:14:53.83,00:14:53.83,hell's happening in this game. I'm just...
249,00:14:58.08,00:14:58.08,trying to survive. (laughs) Thank God for Ace.
250,00:15:02.25,00:15:02.25,"What's funny is I'm pretty sure we're using each other, but I"
251,00:15:05.83,00:15:05.83,feel like my tribe thinks I'm naive and that I'm sticking
252,00:15:10.25,00:15:10.25,"with him out of stupidity, but I'm sticking with him because"
253,00:15:13.33,00:15:13.33,he's the strongest player at this point.
254,00:15:17.00,00:15:17.00,So I just hope that they're not all screwing me around.
255,00:15:33.67,00:15:33.67,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Sugar,"
256,00:15:47.08,00:15:47.08,"returning from Exile Island. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
257,00:15:54.38,00:15:54.38,ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
258,00:15:56.67,00:15:56.67,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first,"
259,00:15:58.38,00:15:58.38,"Dan, I will take it back. Thank you."
260,00:16:05.12,00:16:05.12,Good news and bad news about today's challenge.
261,00:16:07.54,00:16:07.54,"Bad news is, both tribes are going to Tribal Council tonight."
262,00:16:14.21,00:16:14.21,Both tribes are gonna vote somebody out.
263,00:16:16.92,00:16:16.92,"The good news, each of you will have an equal shot at winning..."
264,00:16:22.92,00:16:22.92,individual immunity. It's a log roll.
265,00:16:26.67,00:16:26.67,You're gonna match up against another tribe member.
266,00:16:28.67,00:16:28.67,It might be somebody from the other tribe.
267,00:16:31.08,00:16:31.08,It might be somebody from your own tribe.
268,00:16:32.79,00:16:32.79,Your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person.
269,00:16:36.08,00:16:36.08,First person to hit the water is out.
270,00:16:38.71,00:16:38.71,Winners move on. Last person left standing wins
271,00:16:41.42,00:16:41.42,immunity and is safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
272,00:16:44.67,00:16:44.67,">> I think I may have a target on my back, so it's very, very"
273,00:16:48.00,00:16:48.00,"important for me personally to go in there and win, and not"
274,00:16:50.50,00:16:50.50,just win by a little. Win by a lot.
275,00:16:53.62,00:16:53.62,">> PROBST: In addition, there is a twist which will be revealed"
276,00:16:56.42,00:16:56.42,after the challenge is over. >> Another twist?

296,00:18:26.88,00:18:26.88,No! Kenny in the water first. Sugar moving on.
297,00:18:29.92,00:18:29.92,"Last of the first rounds, Bob and Corinne."
298,00:18:38.21,00:18:38.21,>> Of course he did. (laughter)
299,00:18:40.21,00:18:40.21,>> PROBST: Who knew that would come in handy?
300,00:18:42.21,00:18:42.21,"Here we go, Bob versus Corinne. Bob, the former log roll winner."
301,00:18:49.67,00:18:49.67,"Three, two, one, walk. (Bob whistling, Sugar laughing)"

365,00:23:54.25,00:23:54.25,"and it all depends on the pin-up girl, Sugar."
366,00:23:57.58,00:23:57.58,"So, yeah, I will lie in this game."
367,00:23:59.79,00:23:59.79,I will do everything in my power to get her to vote with
368,00:24:03.71,00:24:03.71,me because my life and Crystal's life rests upon her.
369,00:24:13.12,00:24:13.12,"So, basically, this is honest to God truth."
370,00:24:15.71,00:24:15.71,This is what's happening around camp.
371,00:24:17.21,00:24:17.21,"I'm not lying to you. Matty goes, ""We're voting out"

377,00:24:32.08,00:24:32.08,"They think you're like clueless, you're like a dumb"
378,00:24:33.71,00:24:33.71,"blonde or whatever. Okay, and Ace thinks he has"
379,00:24:35.88,00:24:35.88,you wrapped around his finger. >> Okay.
380,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,"I don't trust Kenny, he might have been lying to me."
381,00:24:40.38,00:24:40.38,But I have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so
382,00:24:43.38,00:24:43.38,"far and I've known that. So, I really don't know who to"
383,00:24:46.38,00:24:46.38,"trust at any point in this game. >> Ace is like, ""Well, I"
384,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,"actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once, I can"
385,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67,probably do that and then we can blindside her and then I'll have
386,00:24:56.04,00:24:56.04,"the hidden immunity idol."" And I was like, ""Oh, my freaking"
387,00:24:59.21,00:24:59.21,"God, this guy is a snake."" >> You and I will say we're"
388,00:25:02.12,00:25:02.12,voting on Crystal. >> We blindside Ace.
389,00:25:07.12,00:25:07.12,>> Blindside Ace today. >> And we don't have to worry
390,00:25:09.42,00:25:09.42,about the snake ever again. >> Never again.
391,00:25:12.21,00:25:12.21,>> I trust Sugar and I trust that she will go along with the
392,00:25:16.12,00:25:16.12,"plan to vote out Ace. She may be the pin-up girl, but"
393,00:25:18.42,00:25:18.42,she's very smart. >> Kenny has reassured me all is
394,00:25:34.21,00:25:34.21,well. I will truly believe Sugar when
395,00:25:38.12,00:25:38.12,she writes Ace's name down. Either she's going to write my
396,00:25:40.67,00:25:40.67,name or she's going to write Ace's name. 
397,00:25:49.21,00:25:49.21,>> Why? Who's going to do that?
398,00:25:59.96,00:25:59.96,They'd only have two votes. Matty's with you.
399,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,">> They'd have three votes. >> No, it'd be Kenny and"
400,00:26:05.04,00:26:05.04,"Crystal, wouldn't it? >> I gave it back to you last"
401,00:26:13.92,00:26:13.92,time. I'll give it back to you this
402,00:26:15.62,00:26:15.62,"time. >> Oh, Ace, I gotta think"
403,00:26:18.29,00:26:18.29,"about it, okay? >> That's fine."
404,00:26:21.25,00:26:21.25,">> You make me feel awful. When Ace asked me for the idol,"
405,00:26:26.04,00:26:26.04,it made me think maybe Kenny was telling me the truth.
406,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,>> Don't you think after... >> Ace definitely knows how to
407,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"finagle people much more than I've ever seen anybody do,"
408,00:26:35.96,00:26:35.96,probably in my life. But he's definitely had my back.
409,00:26:40.71,00:26:40.71,">> I'll bring the last of it, and then that's it."
410,00:26:42.88,00:26:42.88,">> All right, go for it. >> Crystal's supposed to go"
411,00:26:45.12,00:26:45.12,"next, but plans could change. Ace could be turning on me now."
412,00:26:49.04,00:26:49.04,"I have no idea. Oh, God, what am I gonna do with"
413,00:26:54.54,00:26:54.54,"this thing? >> PROBST: Sugar, you've been"
414,00:27:17.21,00:27:17.21,out here 21 days. Tell me about camp life.
415,00:27:20.21,00:27:20.21,"What's going on? >> Um, we are very low on rice."
416,00:27:24.00,00:27:24.00,"Crystal accidentally knocked some over, and she didn't eat"
417,00:27:27.08,00:27:27.08,"because she knocked it over. >> PROBST: Kenny, how much rice"
418,00:27:29.71,00:27:29.71,did you have before Crystal knocked it over?
419,00:27:32.17,00:27:32.17,>> We had about seven days worth.
420,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,Crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled
421,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,"outside back into the pot. So, probably had about five and"
422,00:27:40.92,00:27:40.92,"a half days worth of rice. >> PROBST: So, Matty, the rice"
423,00:27:44.21,00:27:44.21,"is so valuable, that if you spill even a little in the dirt,"
424,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,you gotta pick it out grain by grain.
425,00:27:49.67,00:27:49.67,>> The rice is valuable. It's the most valuable thing we
426,00:27:51.75,00:27:51.75,have. We get about six to eight
427,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,spoonfuls a day of rice. >> PROBST: Wow.
428,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,">> And she spills the rice, and nobody goes, ""God, Crystal,"
429,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,"what are you doing?!"" Nobody... >> No, but your faces said it"
430,00:28:01.88,00:28:01.88,all. >> Just simmer down.
431,00:28:03.21,00:28:03.21,>> Your face said it all. >> My face says it all... nobody
432,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,says a word to her. >> Because they knew it was an
433,00:28:07.12,00:28:07.12,"accident. >> Exactly, so just..."
434,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,>> I didn't purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the
435,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,rice down. >> Just let me get to my point.
436,00:28:11.71,00:28:11.71,Can I get to my point? >> Get to your point and then
437,00:28:13.58,00:28:13.58,"I'll talk. >> So, then we looked past it."
438,00:28:15.21,00:28:15.21,"We moved past that issue. >> PROBST: Ace, make sense of"
439,00:28:18.42,00:28:18.42,that for me. >> Crystal made a mistake.
440,00:28:20.54,00:28:20.54,That's common. The whole part of us feeling
441,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,angry at her I thought was a bit concocted in her own head.
442,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,">> Now I'm delusional. I can see it on your face, Ace."
443,00:28:29.42,00:28:29.42,"Okay, don't look at me like that."
444,00:28:31.33,00:28:31.33,"When Matty turned around he was like, ""Oh, whatever."""
445,00:28:34.04,00:28:34.04,"Then he made some look at you, Ace."
446,00:28:35.67,00:28:35.67,I didn't say anything to anybody.
447,00:28:37.38,00:28:37.38,"I just sat down there picking up about 20,000 grains of rice"
448,00:28:40.67,00:28:40.67,"and then they started to eat. ""Oh, Crystal, come on and eat."""
449,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,"No, I spilled some of the rice so I will go without and"
450,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,that's what I did and that's why I did it.
451,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,">> Nobody asked you to, Crystal. >> It's not like you saved me"
452,00:28:50.75,00:28:50.75,any anyways-- you still ate it. >> I asked you three times...
453,00:28:54.54,00:28:54.54,">> Yeah, I mean, if you cared enough you would've saved me"
454,00:28:56.54,00:28:56.54,"some anyways. >> PROBST: Sugar, you have,"
455,00:29:01.12,00:29:01.12,"like, the perfect seat in the midst of this great"
456,00:29:03.12,00:29:03.12,Shakespearean drama. >> I know.
457,00:29:04.75,00:29:04.75,>> PROBST: Your eyes are like saucers.
458,00:29:06.50,00:29:06.50,>> This sounds like such petty bull crap to me.
459,00:29:09.92,00:29:09.92,"I mean, I think that we can get past our issues better than"
460,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,"this, and this is why we haven't been winning, because people are"
461,00:29:16.83,00:29:16.83,"holding these stupid, petty things against each other."
462,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,">> PROBST: All right, Sugar, you have individual immunity"
463,00:29:23.54,00:29:23.54,tonight. You can assign that to somebody
464,00:29:25.25,00:29:25.25,else or keep it for yourself. >> Keeping it.
465,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,>> PROBST: Sugar is safe tonight.
466,00:29:28.71,00:29:28.71,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
467,00:29:30.88,00:29:30.88,"Ace, you're up. >> You're one of the snakes, and"
468,00:29:46.21,00:29:46.21,I got to get rid of you. Go home.
469,00:29:56.42,00:29:56.42,">> Crystal, I've been waiting for this day for so long, and I"
470,00:29:59.75,00:29:59.75,am so happy it's here. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
471,00:30:15.75,00:30:15.75,votes. If anybody has the hidden
472,00:30:26.62,00:30:26.62,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
473,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
474,00:30:38.50,00:30:38.50,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
475,00:30:40.50,00:30:40.50,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
476,00:30:42.50,00:30:42.50,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Ace."
477,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,"Crystal. One vote Ace, one vote Crystal."
478,00:30:57.67,00:30:57.67,"Ace. Two votes Ace, one vote Crystal."
479,00:31:04.71,00:31:04.71,"We're tied. Two votes Crystal, two votes"
480,00:31:08.25,00:31:08.25,"Ace, one vote left. Seventh person voted out of"
481,00:31:17.42,00:31:17.42,Survivor: Gabon... Ace. That's three.
482,00:31:21.71,00:31:21.71,"You need to bring me your torch. >> PROBST: Ace, the tribe has"
483,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,"spoken. >> Good luck, guys."
484,00:31:48.42,00:31:48.42,">> PROBST: Well, based on the reaction from Ace, I'd say that"
485,00:31:51.08,00:31:51.08,"was a blindside. 21 days in, Fang is finally"
486,00:31:54.62,00:31:54.62,starting to play this game. Grab your torches.
487,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,Head back to camp. Good night.
488,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,"Don't go away. Coming up next, Kota prepares"
489,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,for their own Tribal Council. >> Right now would be an
490,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,optimal time to get me out. >> PROBST: While Dan digs his
491,00:32:12.46,00:32:12.46,own grave... Susie commits social suicide.
492,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,>> I was actually going to vote you.
493,00:32:19.50,00:32:19.50,>> Really?! I hate her.
494,00:32:21.50,00:32:21.50,"I want her gone, yesterday. >> Can I ask you a question?"
495,00:32:39.62,00:32:39.62,">> What? >> I'm not going tonight, am I?"
496,00:32:41.79,00:32:41.79,>> Not that I know of. Given the fact that everyone's
497,00:32:44.17,00:32:44.17,"voting for Susie. >> It has to be Susie, 'cause"
498,00:32:46.46,00:32:46.46,we have no idea. We could stay together as a
499,00:32:48.25,00:32:48.25,tribe for another two rounds. Right now would be an optimal
500,00:32:50.92,00:32:50.92,time to get me out as a strong player so this is a huge vote
501,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"for me, because I'm either going to come back here and trust"
502,00:32:57.33,00:32:57.33,everyone or I'm going to be at home eating a pizza.
503,00:33:12.71,00:33:12.71,>> Please trust us. >> Yeah.
504,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,">> And, you know... >> And-and that is incredible"
505,00:33:25.29,00:33:25.29,"faith on my part, but I know I got to do it."
506,00:33:27.17,00:33:27.17,">> Randy's replaced Bob in a final four situation, because I"
507,00:33:31.54,00:33:31.54,think Randy's willing to cast his lot in with a good group of
508,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,"people, and he's found that. And he, you know, as long as he"
509,00:33:38.42,00:33:38.42,"keeps his end of the bargain, he's got a great run for this"
510,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,game. >> She knows she's low man on
511,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,the totem pole. She's bound to.
512,00:33:51.38,00:33:51.38,"She may continue to dig her grave all day long, and-and"
513,00:33:54.71,00:33:54.71,y'all's conclusion may shift. >> Of course.
514,00:33:56.46,00:33:56.46,">> As annoying as Bob is, I see him as being as loyal and"
515,00:33:59.92,00:33:59.92,"trustworthy as the day is long. >> And-and right now, I can't"
516,00:34:03.12,00:34:03.12,"say the same thing about Dan. >> I can't, either."
517,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,>> But I'm closer being able to say it about Susie than I am
518,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,about Dan. >> Dan is super vulnerable
519,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,tonight. And the only thing Dan has going
520,00:34:12.71,00:34:12.71,for him right now is that he should really cross his fingers
521,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,that Susie's going to blow up and do some crazy stuff.
522,00:34:23.58,00:34:23.58,">> I really like you, and I don't want you to go home."
523,00:34:26.54,00:34:26.54,"So I'm not writing your name down, and I just wanted you to"
524,00:34:29.21,00:34:29.21,know that. You're just not on my list of...
525,00:34:31.08,00:34:31.08,>> Do you know who-who they're thinking about voting out?
526,00:34:33.42,00:34:33.42,">> Um, I think that it's going to be Dan."
527,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,>> That's what your-- your guess is it's gonna be Dan?
528,00:34:38.88,00:34:38.88,">> I think so, yeah. But we felt like we don't want"
529,00:34:40.96,00:34:40.96,to take somebody that's gonna flip.
530,00:34:42.88,00:34:42.88,I feel really good about the fact that you wouldn't.
531,00:34:44.75,00:34:44.75,">> No, I wouldn't, as long as you keep me in the loop."
532,00:34:46.62,00:34:46.62,"I-I figured people were talking, and I figured eventually they"
533,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,"would come to me and tell me where I'm at, you know."
534,00:34:50.83,00:34:50.83,"'Cause I-- when I was gonna-- Okay, I'm gonna be honest with"
535,00:34:53.25,00:34:53.25,you. I was actually going to vote
536,00:34:54.75,00:34:54.75,"you, because... >> Why?"
537,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,>> Because I know that I'm a hard worker.
538,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,"I-I know that without having fire and water and food, how are"
539,00:35:01.92,00:35:01.92,you going to perform physically? You're going to have to take
540,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,that time to do that work. >> Mm-hmm.
541,00:35:05.25,00:35:05.25,">> So I'm just being totally up front with you, so, and"
542,00:35:07.29,00:35:07.29,"that's the truth. >> Okay, so you need me to help"
543,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,"more. >> Well, yeah, I need help from"
544,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,"everybody, actually. So that's where I'm at."
545,00:35:12.71,00:35:12.71,"But I-I appreciate that, 'cause now I know which way I can"
546,00:35:14.67,00:35:14.67,swing. >> So this moron has decided
547,00:35:17.62,00:35:17.62,that she'd like me to go. Really?!
548,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,"I hate her. I hate her, hate her, hate her."
549,00:35:24.88,00:35:24.88,"Like, I really want to stab her in the face."
550,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,"And if you piss me off, you've pissed off my alliance."
551,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,>> Did I not say to you guys she's nuts?
552,00:35:36.29,00:35:36.29,"I mean, certifiable. >> But she's the worst kind of"
553,00:35:38.58,00:35:38.58,"nuts, 'cause you don't see it coming."
554,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,>> She goes whichever way the wind is blowing.
555,00:35:42.12,00:35:42.12,">> Um, I mean, I hate her. I want her gone, yesterday."
556,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,>> Susie's game is no game. And the problem with no game is
557,00:35:50.75,00:35:50.75,her vote can be bought. She's gone.
558,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,">> Tonight, I don't want any sort of curveball."
559,00:35:55.46,00:35:55.46,I do not want to go home tonight.
560,00:35:57.04,00:35:57.04,I don't know what could be cooking.
561,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"I mean, Dan doesn't have the idol, does he?"
562,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,>> Not that I know of. >> What if Susie and Dan get
563,00:36:03.79,00:36:03.79,"together, Dan has the idol, and he's like, ""Let's both"
564,00:36:05.62,00:36:05.62,"vote Corinne""? >> Then you're gone."
565,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,>> Let's just take her out. Then she has to go.
566,00:36:11.17,00:36:11.17,>> Everybody's ass is on the line.
567,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,Susie needs to go. She's annoying.
568,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,"I want her to go home, and soon. >> So, um, here's the thing."
569,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,"My entire plan was wedged on the fact that Susie is easy, she"
570,00:36:25.29,00:36:25.29,"trusts us, and she's never gonna win individual immunity."
571,00:36:27.17,00:36:27.17,We can get rid of her when we want.
572,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,I didn't realize she was loco en la cabeza.
573,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,"Like, I had no idea that that was what I was dealing with."
574,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,">> I am devastated right now. >> Well, I'm completely"
575,00:36:36.62,00:36:36.62,"frustrated, because I feel like we got some issues that we had"
576,00:36:39.25,00:36:39.25,no idea existed. >> What do you think is the
577,00:36:40.62,00:36:40.62,safer bet? 'Cause I'm really a little
578,00:36:41.96,00:36:41.96,concerned. >> We're at the point where
579,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,I think either decision has incredible risks associated
580,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,with it. >> Right.
581,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33,>> Thank God we have a two-person advantage at this
582,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,point. But Dan could have the
583,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"immunity idol. But I really doubt it, so--"
584,00:36:55.54,00:36:55.54,"If he actually does have the immunity idol, we should vote"
585,00:36:57.79,00:36:57.79,out Susie. >> Yeah.
586,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,>> Just in case there's an idol. >> Yeah.
587,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,"We're worried that Dan has the immunity idol, because he spent"
588,00:37:04.54,00:37:04.54,a couple days on Exile Island. But we also think that Dan may
589,00:37:07.25,00:37:07.25,"need to go. So unfortunately, it's not who"
590,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,is the best asset. It's who is the least risky.
591,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,"Which stinks because, you know, we still don't know who we're"
592,00:37:16.75,00:37:16.75,"gonna be better off with. >> PROBST: Marcus, is the game"
593,00:37:39.21,00:37:39.21,at a point where you're now looking out for yourself versus
594,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,keeping our tribe strong? >> I think we're basing our
595,00:37:44.50,00:37:44.50,decision on what we're expecting to come in the next
596,00:37:47.12,00:37:47.12,few days. We've got to surround ourselves
597,00:37:49.17,00:37:49.17,"with the most powerful crowd of people, because that's the only"
598,00:37:52.04,00:37:52.04,way we're going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the
599,00:37:55.04,00:37:55.04,"Fang tribe. >> PROBST: Susie, looking at"
600,00:37:57.38,00:37:57.38,"this tribe, you got to be a little concerned yourself."
601,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,Is it fair to say that you're the weakest person on this
602,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,tribe in challenges? >> I-I don't think I am.
603,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,I think there's certain skills that I may be a little bit
604,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,"weaker at, but... >> PROBST: Who's weaker than"
605,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,"you on this tribe? >> Um, I think strength-wise,"
606,00:38:12.92,00:38:12.92,"upper strength, I think I'm stronger than Corinne."
607,00:38:15.25,00:38:15.25,>> PROBST: Corinne not buying that at all.
608,00:38:17.04,00:38:17.04,>> I don't want to insult her. I think that she is very
609,00:38:19.46,00:38:19.46,"skilled, and I think that she does have athletic talent, you"
610,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,know. >> PROBST: She just insulted
611,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,"you. >> Well, yes, and that's why I'm"
612,00:38:25.25,00:38:25.25,telling you that I don't agree. I think that I have a lot to
613,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,offer. I think I have upper body
614,00:38:29.46,00:38:29.46,strength. I think I've got a lot of
615,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,"things, but... >> And you probably do."
616,00:38:32.46,00:38:32.46,"I don't-- I mean, I'm just, I'm trying to just kind of observe"
617,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,"and just kind of see where this game's taking me, and..."
618,00:38:37.54,00:38:37.54,">> PROBST: Corinne, have you picked up on Susie's tendencies"
619,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"to maybe sometimes let loose? >> Yeah, but I've operated"
620,00:38:43.75,00:38:43.75,"without a filter for so many years that, like, I totally"
621,00:38:46.42,00:38:46.42,respect when people come out of their shell and just say
622,00:38:49.08,00:38:49.08,whatever it is that they're thinking.
623,00:38:50.54,00:38:50.54,"I mean, I would encourage more of that."
624,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,"Maybe you should blow up once in a while, and then I'll know"
625,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,"you better. >> PROBST: Randy, where do you"
626,00:38:57.12,00:38:57.12,"sit on the ""be yourself"" versus ""hold it in""?"
627,00:39:00.79,00:39:00.79,">> I'm probably about eight on a scale of ten, and that's good"
628,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,and bad. >> PROBST: What's good about it?
629,00:39:07.29,00:39:07.29,">> I don't have to pretend. And, uh, you know, people pretty"
630,00:39:11.50,00:39:11.50,much know where I stand most of the time.
631,00:39:13.62,00:39:13.62,">> PROBST: What's bad about it? >> I don't have to pretend, and"
632,00:39:16.58,00:39:16.58,people know where I stand most of the time.
633,00:39:18.46,00:39:18.46,"(laughter) >> PROBST: Dan, where do you fit"
634,00:39:20.92,00:39:20.92,"in on that? >> Um, I tend to be a"
635,00:39:23.00,00:39:23.00,"worrywart, and so it has inhibited me from being"
636,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,completely comfortable and completely myself.
637,00:39:30.08,00:39:30.08,But my result in the game will fare much better if I can shake
638,00:39:34.21,00:39:34.21,"it off and just relax. >> PROBST: Charlie, how big a"
639,00:39:36.88,00:39:36.88,factor is trust becoming? 21 days in for this group of
640,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,"seven. >> It's huge, because we intend"
641,00:39:43.25,00:39:43.25,to go into a merge as a powerful group together.
642,00:39:46.33,00:39:46.33,"And if someone splinters, our numbers will dwindle before the"
643,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,Fang numbers dwindle. So my vote is based on who I can
644,00:39:53.08,00:39:53.08,"trust going into a merge most. >> PROBST: Corinne, is it"
645,00:39:56.79,00:39:56.79,possible that tonight's vote could be a mistake?
646,00:40:00.04,00:40:00.04,">> Damn, yeah. I don't know if we're making"
647,00:40:02.46,00:40:02.46,the right decision or if I personally am making the right
648,00:40:04.62,00:40:04.62,decision. I hope that I am.
649,00:40:07.17,00:40:07.17,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
650,00:40:08.54,00:40:08.54,"Marcus, thanks to a nice performance today, you have"
651,00:40:10.88,00:40:10.88,individual immunity. It is yours unless you choose
652,00:40:13.04,00:40:13.04,"to give it to somebody else. >> We won it for Kota, but I'm"
653,00:40:15.71,00:40:15.71,"going to hang on to this one. >> PROBST: All right, you cannot"
654,00:40:17.92,00:40:17.92,vote for Marcus. Everybody else is fair game.
655,00:40:20.00,00:40:20.00,"It is time to vote. Bob, you're up."
656,00:40:32.04,00:40:32.04,">> Dan. Sorry, guy."
657,00:40:42.12,00:40:42.12,">> Susie, you have a, uh, a great heart, and I'm going to"
658,00:40:46.00,00:40:46.00,vote with what I think the rest of the tribe is voting.
659,00:41:00.00,00:41:00.00,">> This is about Dan, not you. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
660,00:41:11.17,00:41:11.17,votes. If anybody has the hidden
661,00:41:24.04,00:41:24.04,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
662,00:41:26.83,00:41:26.83,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
663,00:41:32.42,00:41:32.42,the decision is final. Person voted out will be
664,00:41:34.33,00:41:34.33,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
665,00:41:36.58,00:41:36.58,I'll read the votes. First vote: Susie.
666,00:41:45.17,00:41:45.17,Dan. Dan.
667,00:41:50.83,00:41:50.83,"Two votes Dan, one vote Susie. Susie."
668,00:41:56.75,00:41:56.75,"We're tied; two votes Susie, two votes Dan."
669,00:42:01.79,00:42:01.79,"Dan. Three votes Dan, two votes"
670,00:42:04.50,00:42:04.50,Susie. Susie.
671,00:42:10.08,00:42:10.08,"We're tied; three votes Susie, three votes Dan."
672,00:42:13.08,00:42:13.08,One vote left. Eighth person voted out of
673,00:42:18.25,00:42:18.25,Survivor: Gabon... Dan.
674,00:42:22.46,00:42:22.46,"Need to bring me your torch. Dan, the tribe has spoken."
675,00:42:38.04,00:42:38.04,"It's time for you to go. >> Thanks, Jeff."
676,00:42:50.08,00:42:50.08,">> PROBST: Well, despite being very successful, this is not"
677,00:42:53.71,00:42:53.71,"one big, happy family. Grab your torches, head back to"
678,00:42:56.33,00:42:56.33,camp. Good night.

683,00:43:16.83,00:43:16.83,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
684,00:43:18.62,00:43:18.62,There's a new leader in Africa. And they call him Randy.
685,00:43:22.71,00:43:22.71,">> I am king of Gabon. I'm sorry, but I rule."
686,00:43:26.29,00:43:26.29,"This ocean, it's mine. All those Fang and Kota"
687,00:43:30.25,00:43:30.25,"members, they know the power is shifting."
688,00:43:32.62,00:43:32.62,I'm king. Cheers.
689,00:43:34.50,00:43:34.50,>> Whoo! >> This pretty much blows.
690,00:43:43.33,00:43:43.33,There's a definite level of disappointment in relation to
691,00:43:45.83,00:43:45.83,"Sugar. Matty, I respect you, you know."
692,00:43:48.04,00:43:48.04,I wish you the best. C'est la vie.
693,00:43:50.17,00:43:50.17,">> Um, a lot of mixed feelings right now."
694,00:43:52.71,00:43:52.71,A little bit disappointed that I didn't make it further in the
695,00:43:54.88,00:43:54.88,"game. On the other hand, it feels"
696,00:43:56.21,00:43:56.21,good to be able to be myself. And I got some great friends and
697,00:43:58.62,00:43:58.62,"family to go back to, so that's really about it."
