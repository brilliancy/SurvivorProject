377,00:24:33.71,00:24:33.71,"blonde or whatever.Okay, and Ace thinks he has"
378,00:24:35.88,00:24:35.88,you wrapped around his finger.>> Okay.
379,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,"I don't trust Kenny, he mighthave been lying to me."
380,00:24:40.38,00:24:40.38,But I have been trusting thebiggest snake in the game so
381,00:24:43.38,00:24:43.38,"far and I've known that.So, I really don't know who to"
382,00:24:46.38,00:24:46.38,"trust at any point in this game.>> Ace is like, ""Well, I"
383,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,"actually got the hidden immunityidol from her once, I can"
384,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67,probably do that and then we canblindside her and then I'll have
385,00:24:56.04,00:24:56.04,"the hidden immunity idol.""And I was like, ""Oh, my freaking"
386,00:24:59.21,00:24:59.21,"God, this guy is a snake."">> You and I will say we're"
387,00:25:02.12,00:25:02.12,voting on Crystal.>> We blindside Ace.
388,00:25:07.12,00:25:07.12,>> Blindside Ace today.>> And we don't have to worry
389,00:25:09.42,00:25:09.42,about the snake ever again.>> Never again.
390,00:25:12.21,00:25:12.21,>> I trust Sugar and I trustthat she will go along with the
391,00:25:16.12,00:25:16.12,"plan to vote out Ace.She may be the pin-up girl, but"
392,00:25:18.42,00:25:18.42,she's very smart.>> Kenny has reassured me all is
393,00:25:34.21,00:25:34.21,well.I will truly believe Sugar when
394,00:25:38.12,00:25:38.12,she writes Ace's name down.Either she's going to write my
395,00:25:40.67,00:25:40.67,name or she's going to writeAce's name. 
396,00:25:49.21,00:25:49.21,>> Why?Who's going to do that?
397,00:25:59.96,00:25:59.96,They'd only have two votes.Matty's with you.
398,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,">> They'd have three votes.>> No, it'd be Kenny and"
399,00:26:05.04,00:26:05.04,"Crystal, wouldn't it?>> I gave it back to you last"
400,00:26:13.92,00:26:13.92,time.I'll give it back to you this
401,00:26:15.62,00:26:15.62,"time.>> Oh, Ace, I gotta think"
402,00:26:18.29,00:26:18.29,"about it, okay?>> That's fine."
403,00:26:21.25,00:26:21.25,">> You make me feel awful.When Ace asked me for the idol,"
404,00:26:26.04,00:26:26.04,it made me think maybe Kennywas telling me the truth.
405,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,>> Don't you think after...>> Ace definitely knows how to
406,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"finagle people much more thanI've ever seen anybody do,"
407,00:26:35.96,00:26:35.96,probably in my life.But he's definitely had my back.
408,00:26:40.71,00:26:40.71,">> I'll bring the last of it,and then that's it."
409,00:26:42.88,00:26:42.88,">> All right, go for it.>> Crystal's supposed to go"
410,00:26:45.12,00:26:45.12,"next, but plans could change.Ace could be turning on me now."
411,00:26:49.04,00:26:49.04,"I have no idea.Oh, God, what am I gonna do with"
412,00:26:54.54,00:26:54.54,"this thing?>> PROBST: Sugar, you've been"
413,00:27:17.21,00:27:17.21,out here 21 days.Tell me about camp life.
414,00:27:20.21,00:27:20.21,"What's going on?>> Um, we are very low on rice."
415,00:27:24.00,00:27:24.00,"Crystal accidentally knockedsome over, and she didn't eat"
416,00:27:27.08,00:27:27.08,"because she knocked it over.>> PROBST: Kenny, how much rice"
417,00:27:29.71,00:27:29.71,did you have before Crystalknocked it over?
418,00:27:32.17,00:27:32.17,>> We had about seven daysworth.
419,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,Crystal ended up scooping someof the rice that she spilled
420,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,"outside back into the pot.So, probably had about five and"
421,00:27:40.92,00:27:40.92,"a half days worth of rice.>> PROBST: So, Matty, the rice"
422,00:27:44.21,00:27:44.21,"is so valuable, that if youspill even a little in the dirt,"
423,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,you gotta pick it out grain bygrain.
424,00:27:49.67,00:27:49.67,>> The rice is valuable.It's the most valuable thing we
425,00:27:51.75,00:27:51.75,have.We get about six to eight
426,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,spoonfuls a day of rice.>> PROBST: Wow.
427,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,">> And she spills the rice, andnobody goes, ""God, Crystal,"
428,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,"what are you doing?!"" Nobody...>> No, but your faces said it"
429,00:28:01.88,00:28:01.88,all.>> Just simmer down.
430,00:28:03.21,00:28:03.21,>> Your face said it all.>> My face says it all... nobody
431,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,says a word to her.>> Because they knew it was an
432,00:28:07.12,00:28:07.12,"accident.>> Exactly, so just..."
433,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,>> I didn't purposely go over tothe rice box and just throw the
434,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,rice down.>> Just let me get to my point.
435,00:28:11.71,00:28:11.71,Can I get to my point?>> Get to your point and then
436,00:28:13.58,00:28:13.58,"I'll talk.>> So, then we looked past it."
437,00:28:15.21,00:28:15.21,"We moved past that issue.>> PROBST: Ace, make sense of"
438,00:28:18.42,00:28:18.42,that for me.>> Crystal made a mistake.
439,00:28:20.54,00:28:20.54,That's common.The whole part of us feeling
440,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,angry at her I thought was a bitconcocted in her own head.
441,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,">> Now I'm delusional.I can see it on your face, Ace."
442,00:28:29.42,00:28:29.42,"Okay, don't look at me likethat."
443,00:28:31.33,00:28:31.33,"When Matty turned around he waslike, ""Oh, whatever."""
444,00:28:34.04,00:28:34.04,"Then he made some look at you,Ace."
445,00:28:35.67,00:28:35.67,I didn't say anything toanybody.
446,00:28:37.38,00:28:37.38,"I just sat down there picking upabout 20,000 grains of rice"
447,00:28:40.67,00:28:40.67,"and then they started to eat.""Oh, Crystal, come on and eat."""
448,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,"No, I spilled some of the riceso I will go without and"
449,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,that's what I did and that'swhy I did it.
450,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,">> Nobody asked you to, Crystal.>> It's not like you saved me"
451,00:28:50.75,00:28:50.75,any anyways-- you still ate it.>> I asked you three times...
452,00:28:54.54,00:28:54.54,">> Yeah, I mean, if you caredenough you would've saved me"
453,00:28:56.54,00:28:56.54,"some anyways.>> PROBST: Sugar, you have,"
454,00:29:01.12,00:29:01.12,"like, the perfect seat in themidst of this great"
455,00:29:03.12,00:29:03.12,Shakespearean drama.>> I know.
456,00:29:04.75,00:29:04.75,>> PROBST: Your eyes are likesaucers.
457,00:29:06.50,00:29:06.50,>> This sounds like such pettybull crap to me.
458,00:29:09.92,00:29:09.92,"I mean, I think that we can getpast our issues better than"
459,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,"this, and this is why we haven'tbeen winning, because people are"
460,00:29:16.83,00:29:16.83,"holding these stupid, pettythings against each other."
461,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,">> PROBST: All right, Sugar, youhave individual immunity"
462,00:29:23.54,00:29:23.54,tonight.You can assign that to somebody
463,00:29:25.25,00:29:25.25,else or keep it for yourself.>> Keeping it.
464,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,>> PROBST: Sugar is safetonight.
465,00:29:28.71,00:29:28.71,Everybody else is fair game.It is time to vote.
466,00:29:30.88,00:29:30.88,"Ace, you're up.>> You're one of the snakes, and"
467,00:29:46.21,00:29:46.21,I got to get rid of you.Go home.
468,00:29:56.42,00:29:56.42,">> Crystal, I've been waitingfor this day for so long, and I"
469,00:29:59.75,00:29:59.75,am so happy it's here.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
470,00:30:15.75,00:30:15.75,votes.If anybody has the hidden

472,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,"to do so.Okay, once the votes are read,"
473,00:30:38.50,00:30:38.50,the decision is final.The person voted out will be
474,00:30:40.50,00:30:40.50,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
475,00:30:42.50,00:30:42.50,"I'll read the votes.First vote, Ace."
476,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,"Crystal.One vote Ace, one vote Crystal."

480,00:31:17.42,00:31:17.42,Survivor: Gabon...Ace. That's three.
481,00:31:21.71,00:31:21.71,"You need to bring me your torch.>> PROBST: Ace, the tribe has"
482,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,"spoken.>> Good luck, guys."
483,00:31:48.42,00:31:48.42,">> PROBST: Well, based on thereaction from Ace, I'd say that"
484,00:31:51.08,00:31:51.08,"was a blindside.21 days in, Fang is finally"
485,00:31:54.62,00:31:54.62,starting to play this game.Grab your torches.
486,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,Head back to camp.Good night.
487,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,"Don't go away.Coming up next, Kota prepares"
488,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,for their own Tribal Council.>> Right now would be an
489,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,optimal time to get me out.>> PROBST: While Dan digs his
490,00:32:12.46,00:32:12.46,own grave...Susie commits social suicide.
491,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,>> I was actually going to voteyou.

493,00:32:21.50,00:32:21.50,"I want her gone, yesterday.>> Can I ask you a question?"
494,00:32:39.62,00:32:39.62,">> What?>> I'm not going tonight, am I?"
495,00:32:41.79,00:32:41.79,>> Not that I know of.Given the fact that everyone's
496,00:32:44.17,00:32:44.17,"voting for Susie.>> It has to be Susie, 'cause"
497,00:32:46.46,00:32:46.46,we have no idea.We could stay together as a
498,00:32:48.25,00:32:48.25,tribe for another two rounds.Right now would be an optimal
499,00:32:50.92,00:32:50.92,time to get me out as a strongplayer so this is a huge vote
500,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"for me, because I'm either goingto come back here and trust"
501,00:32:57.33,00:32:57.33,everyone or I'm going to be athome eating a pizza.
502,00:33:12.71,00:33:12.71,>> Please trust us.>> Yeah.
503,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,">> And, you know...>> And-and that is incredible"
504,00:33:25.29,00:33:25.29,"faith on my part, but I know Igot to do it."
505,00:33:27.17,00:33:27.17,">> Randy's replaced Bob in afinal four situation, because I"
506,00:33:31.54,00:33:31.54,think Randy's willing to casthis lot in with a good group of
507,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,"people, and he's found that.And he, you know, as long as he"
508,00:33:38.42,00:33:38.42,"keeps his end of the bargain,he's got a great run for this"
509,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,game.>> She knows she's low man on
510,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,the totem pole.She's bound to.

515,00:34:03.12,00:34:03.12,"say the same thing about Dan.>> I can't, either."
516,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,>> But I'm closer being able tosay it about Susie than I am
517,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,about Dan.>> Dan is super vulnerable
518,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,tonight.And the only thing Dan has going
519,00:34:12.71,00:34:12.71,for him right now is that heshould really cross his fingers
520,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,that Susie's going to blow upand do some crazy stuff.
521,00:34:23.58,00:34:23.58,">> I really like you, and Idon't want you to go home."
522,00:34:26.54,00:34:26.54,"So I'm not writing your namedown, and I just wanted you to"
523,00:34:29.21,00:34:29.21,know that.You're just not on my list of...
524,00:34:31.08,00:34:31.08,>> Do you know who-who they'rethinking about voting out?
525,00:34:33.42,00:34:33.42,">> Um, I think that it's goingto be Dan."
526,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,>> That's what your-- your guessis it's gonna be Dan?
527,00:34:38.88,00:34:38.88,">> I think so, yeah.But we felt like we don't want"
528,00:34:40.96,00:34:40.96,to take somebody that's gonnaflip.
529,00:34:42.88,00:34:42.88,I feel really good about thefact that you wouldn't.
530,00:34:44.75,00:34:44.75,">> No, I wouldn't, as long asyou keep me in the loop."
531,00:34:46.62,00:34:46.62,"I-I figured people were talking,and I figured eventually they"
532,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,"would come to me and tell mewhere I'm at, you know."
533,00:34:50.83,00:34:50.83,"'Cause I-- when I was gonna--Okay, I'm gonna be honest with"
534,00:34:53.25,00:34:53.25,you.I was actually going to vote
535,00:34:54.75,00:34:54.75,"you, because...>> Why?"
536,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,>> Because I know that I'm ahard worker.

538,00:35:01.92,00:35:01.92,you going to perform physically?You're going to have to take
539,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,that time to do that work.>> Mm-hmm.
540,00:35:05.25,00:35:05.25,">> So I'm just being totally upfront with you, so, and"
541,00:35:07.29,00:35:07.29,"that's the truth.>> Okay, so you need me to help"
542,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,"more.>> Well, yeah, I need help from"
543,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,"everybody, actually.So that's where I'm at."
544,00:35:12.71,00:35:12.71,"But I-I appreciate that, 'causenow I know which way I can"

548,00:35:24.88,00:35:24.88,"Like, I really want to stab herin the face."
549,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,"And if you piss me off, you'vepissed off my alliance."
550,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,>> Did I not say to you guysshe's nuts?
551,00:35:36.29,00:35:36.29,"I mean, certifiable.>> But she's the worst kind of"
552,00:35:38.58,00:35:38.58,"nuts, 'cause you don't see itcoming."
553,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,>> She goes whichever way thewind is blowing.
554,00:35:42.12,00:35:42.12,">> Um, I mean, I hate her.I want her gone, yesterday."
555,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,>> Susie's game is no game.And the problem with no game is
556,00:35:50.75,00:35:50.75,her vote can be bought.She's gone.
557,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,">> Tonight, I don't want anysort of curveball."
558,00:35:55.46,00:35:55.46,I do not want to go hometonight.
559,00:35:57.04,00:35:57.04,I don't know what could becooking.
560,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"I mean, Dan doesn't have theidol, does he?"
561,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,>> Not that I know of.>> What if Susie and Dan get
562,00:36:03.79,00:36:03.79,"together, Dan has the idol,and he's like, ""Let's both"
563,00:36:05.62,00:36:05.62,"vote Corinne""?>> Then you're gone."
564,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,>> Let's just take her out.Then she has to go.
565,00:36:11.17,00:36:11.17,>> Everybody's ass is on theline.
566,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,Susie needs to go.She's annoying.
567,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,"I want her to go home, and soon.>> So, um, here's the thing."
568,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,"My entire plan was wedged on thefact that Susie is easy, she"
569,00:36:25.29,00:36:25.29,"trusts us, and she's nevergonna win individual immunity."
570,00:36:27.17,00:36:27.17,We can get rid of her when wewant.
571,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,I didn't realize she was locoen la cabeza.
572,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,"Like, I had no idea that thatwas what I was dealing with."
573,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,">> I am devastated right now.>> Well, I'm completely"
574,00:36:36.62,00:36:36.62,"frustrated, because I feel likewe got some issues that we had"
575,00:36:39.25,00:36:39.25,no idea existed.>> What do you think is the
576,00:36:40.62,00:36:40.62,safer bet?'Cause I'm really a little
577,00:36:41.96,00:36:41.96,concerned.>> We're at the point where
578,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,I think either decision hasincredible risks associated
579,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,with it.>> Right.
580,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33,>> Thank God we have atwo-person advantage at this
581,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,point.But Dan could have the
582,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"immunity idol.But I really doubt it, so--"
583,00:36:55.54,00:36:55.54,"If he actually does have theimmunity idol, we should vote"
584,00:36:57.79,00:36:57.79,out Susie.>> Yeah.
585,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,>> Just in case there's an idol.>> Yeah.
586,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,"We're worried that Dan has theimmunity idol, because he spent"
587,00:37:04.54,00:37:04.54,a couple days on Exile Island.But we also think that Dan may
588,00:37:07.25,00:37:07.25,"need to go.So unfortunately, it's not who"
589,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,is the best asset.It's who is the least risky.
590,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,"Which stinks because, you know,we still don't know who we're"
591,00:37:16.75,00:37:16.75,"gonna be better off with.>> PROBST: Marcus, is the game"
592,00:37:39.21,00:37:39.21,at a point where you're nowlooking out for yourself versus
593,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,keeping our tribe strong?>> I think we're basing our
594,00:37:44.50,00:37:44.50,decision on what we'reexpecting to come in the next
595,00:37:47.12,00:37:47.12,few days.We've got to surround ourselves
596,00:37:49.17,00:37:49.17,"with the most powerful crowd ofpeople, because that's the only"
597,00:37:52.04,00:37:52.04,way we're going to survive anonslaught from the rest of the
598,00:37:55.04,00:37:55.04,"Fang tribe.>> PROBST: Susie, looking at"
599,00:37:57.38,00:37:57.38,"this tribe, you got to be alittle concerned yourself."
600,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,Is it fair to say that you'rethe weakest person on this
601,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,tribe in challenges?>> I-I don't think I am.
602,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,I think there's certain skillsthat I may be a little bit
603,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,"weaker at, but...>> PROBST: Who's weaker than"
604,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,"you on this tribe?>> Um, I think strength-wise,"
605,00:38:12.92,00:38:12.92,"upper strength, I think I'mstronger than Corinne."
606,00:38:15.25,00:38:15.25,>> PROBST: Corinne not buyingthat at all.
607,00:38:17.04,00:38:17.04,>> I don't want to insult her.I think that she is very
608,00:38:19.46,00:38:19.46,"skilled, and I think that shedoes have athletic talent, you"
609,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,know.>> PROBST: She just insulted
610,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,"you.>> Well, yes, and that's why I'm"
611,00:38:25.25,00:38:25.25,telling you that I don't agree.I think that I have a lot to
612,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,offer.I think I have upper body
613,00:38:29.46,00:38:29.46,strength.I think I've got a lot of
614,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,"things, but...>> And you probably do."
615,00:38:32.46,00:38:32.46,"I don't-- I mean, I'm just, I'mtrying to just kind of observe"
616,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,"and just kind of see where thisgame's taking me, and..."
617,00:38:37.54,00:38:37.54,">> PROBST: Corinne, have youpicked up on Susie's tendencies"
618,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"to maybe sometimes let loose?>> Yeah, but I've operated"
619,00:38:43.75,00:38:43.75,"without a filter for so manyyears that, like, I totally"
620,00:38:46.42,00:38:46.42,respect when people come out oftheir shell and just say
621,00:38:49.08,00:38:49.08,whatever it is that they'rethinking.
622,00:38:50.54,00:38:50.54,"I mean, I would encourage moreof that."
623,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,"Maybe you should blow up oncein a while, and then I'll know"
624,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,"you better.>> PROBST: Randy, where do you"
625,00:38:57.12,00:38:57.12,"sit on the ""be yourself"" versus""hold it in""?"
626,00:39:00.79,00:39:00.79,">> I'm probably about eight on ascale of ten, and that's good"
627,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,and bad.>> PROBST: What's good about it?
628,00:39:07.29,00:39:07.29,">> I don't have to pretend.And, uh, you know, people pretty"
629,00:39:11.50,00:39:11.50,much know where I stand most ofthe time.

631,00:39:16.58,00:39:16.58,people know where I stand mostof the time.

633,00:39:20.92,00:39:20.92,"in on that?>> Um, I tend to be a"
634,00:39:23.00,00:39:23.00,"worrywart, and so it hasinhibited me from being"
635,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,completely comfortable andcompletely myself.
636,00:39:30.08,00:39:30.08,But my result in the game willfare much better if I can shake
637,00:39:34.21,00:39:34.21,"it off and just relax.>> PROBST: Charlie, how big a"
638,00:39:36.88,00:39:36.88,factor is trust becoming?21 days in for this group of
639,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,"seven.>> It's huge, because we intend"
640,00:39:43.25,00:39:43.25,to go into a merge as apowerful group together.
641,00:39:46.33,00:39:46.33,"And if someone splinters, ournumbers will dwindle before the"
642,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,Fang numbers dwindle.So my vote is based on who I can

644,00:39:56.79,00:39:56.79,possible that tonight's votecould be a mistake?
645,00:40:00.04,00:40:00.04,">> Damn, yeah.I don't know if we're making"
