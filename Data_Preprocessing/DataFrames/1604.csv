315,00:21:57.21,00:21:57.21,they realize that he's a muchmore dangerous person to keep
316,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,around because of the ease withwhich he would flip.
317,00:22:04.42,00:22:04.42,">> You make a very valid point,I think."
318,00:22:06.04,00:22:06.04,>> He's a charmer.He's an actor.

341,00:23:41.25,00:23:41.25,where it might be.>> I guess I was just thinking
342,00:23:43.33,00:23:43.33,all the clues are going to be inthe same place and maybe it
343,00:23:46.12,00:23:46.12,would be as easy as just digginga hole or something.
344,00:23:49.12,00:23:49.12,But it's a lot harder than Ithought it was going to be.

565,00:34:55.25,00:34:55.25,>> Yes.>> We'll see.
566,00:34:57.58,00:34:57.58,"Tonight will be interesting.>> Personally, I think it's"
567,00:35:02.83,00:35:02.83,going to go me tonight.That's what I'm thinking.
568,00:35:09.46,00:35:09.46,>> And that would mean that Joeldid the wrong thing.
569,00:35:11.67,00:35:11.67,>> Whatever.>> PROBST: Sorry to see you guys
570,00:35:37.54,00:35:37.54,"here.After tonight's vote, you'll be"
571,00:35:41.62,00:35:41.62,"even with the favorites.So, Jason, that might imply that"
572,00:35:45.25,00:35:45.25,the game is even.Do you think it is?
573,00:35:47.50,00:35:47.50,">> Right now, I would definitelysay that the favorites have an"
574,00:35:50.92,00:35:50.92,advantage.We've lost four of the past six
575,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,"challenges.But you know, maybe tonight's"
576,00:35:57.62,00:35:57.62,tribal council will be able tomake a stronger tribe.
577,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,">> PROBST: Joel, how importantis it to keep a tribe strong in"
578,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,terms of winning challenges?>> It's extremely important.
579,00:36:09.25,00:36:09.25,"You know, the weaker ourindividuals are, the weaker we"
580,00:36:12.79,00:36:12.79,are as a team.>> PROBST: Who here will own up
581,00:36:16.54,00:36:16.54,to the fact that maybe theyhaven't delivered that well in
582,00:36:19.21,00:36:19.21,"challenges?Chet, what's been lacking?"
583,00:36:24.92,00:36:24.92,">> For me, probably maybe thefirst challenge I did in the"
584,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,water was a little bit more thanwhat I thought it was.
585,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,"But when it comes to certainchallenges, I can take certain"
586,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,roles where I wouldn't need thatextreme strength.
587,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,">> PROBST: So other than thatchallenge, you feel pretty good"
588,00:36:39.00,00:36:39.00,"about your effort?>> Yes, I do."
589,00:36:41.96,00:36:41.96,">> To be honest with you, Chethas been hurting."
590,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,"I mean, Chet's been exhaustedfor four days straight."
591,00:36:47.46,00:36:47.46,It's nothing personal againsthim.
592,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,I just don't think he has thephysical capacity to compete.
593,00:36:53.25,00:36:53.25,">> Can I say something?I didn't compete, and Chet"
594,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,"didn't compete, and Kathy didn'tcompete, and they still lost."
595,00:37:00.54,00:37:00.54,So tell me how you can takeblame for that.
596,00:37:05.88,00:37:05.88,">> PROBST: Mikey B., in aperfect world, what happens when"
597,00:37:08.21,00:37:08.21,you go back to camp tonight?>> I just want to vote out the
598,00:37:11.25,00:37:11.25,people who are weak and who arephysically unable to perform.
599,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,And I hope people who told methe way they were voting tonight
600,00:37:19.38,00:37:19.38,"stick to it, because sometimesyou have to give a little trust"
601,00:37:22.12,00:37:22.12,"to earn a little trust.>> PROBST: Erik, there seems to"
602,00:37:25.29,00:37:25.29,be somewhat of a consensus thatwe need to keep the tribe
603,00:37:28.17,00:37:28.17,physically strong forchallenges.
604,00:37:30.21,00:37:30.21,Do you agree with that?>> I agree we need to keep this
605,00:37:33.21,00:37:33.21,"tribe strong, but it's not aboutphysical attributes in all these"
606,00:37:36.71,00:37:36.71,challenges.I think that there's more to it
607,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,"than that.>> PROBST: Joel, you were almost"
608,00:37:41.58,00:37:41.58,nodding in agreement.>> I think strength is not just
609,00:37:44.62,00:37:44.62,"physical strength.Am I the biggest, strongest guy"
610,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,on this team?Yes.
611,00:37:48.29,00:37:48.29,But that doesn't mean that I'mgoing to be the number-one
612,00:37:50.71,00:37:50.71,person in every challenge thatwe have.
613,00:37:53.12,00:37:53.12,>> Exactly.My point is really there's a
614,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,"direct way to go aboutsomething, but that's not the"
615,00:37:58.29,00:37:58.29,"best way.I mean, you can run into a wall"
616,00:38:00.79,00:38:00.79,100 times; that's not the bestway to get rid of a wall.
617,00:38:04.12,00:38:04.12,">> PROBST: All right, it is timeto vote."
618,00:38:07.46,00:38:07.46,Jason.>> Again I need to emphasize the
619,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,importance of tonight's vote indetermining our future as a
620,00:38:13.88,00:38:13.88,tribe.We have lost four of six
621,00:38:17.00,00:38:17.00,challenges.So take a moment to really think
622,00:38:20.08,00:38:20.08,about how important it is who wekeep on the island and who we
623,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,let go.>> PROBST: Any other comments
624,00:38:26.25,00:38:26.25,from anybody else?All right.
625,00:38:30.79,00:38:30.79,"Now it is time to vote.Jason, you're up."
626,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,">> Please leave the island.>> Mike, you've been a loud"
627,00:39:05.25,00:39:05.25,"mouth from day one, and younever seem to learn."
628,00:39:49.50,00:39:49.50,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
