565,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,"of me, like, wants to havesympathy for him, but another"
566,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,"side of me, I almost relishedthe fact that they got injured."
567,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"I was like, ""Good for them.""(laughter)"
568,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,>> I definitely had mixedemotions about losing the
569,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,"challenge, because whereaspersonally it made a statement,"
570,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,the tribe lost.I had him the whole time.
571,00:36:36.38,00:36:36.38,There was not one point in thatchallenge where I thought he
572,00:36:38.92,00:36:38.92,was gonna get the better of me.>> You were very relaxed.
573,00:36:40.96,00:36:40.96,"I saw it in your face.>> Well, there was this sec"
574,00:36:42.58,00:36:42.58,that he almost took off runningand you had to tackle him down.
575,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,">> Yeah.>> We were like, ""No!"""
576,00:36:47.71,00:36:47.71,>> Everybody thought that Colbywas gonna have his way with me.
577,00:36:50.54,00:36:50.54,"The tribe was taking about itlong after I'd forgotten it,"
578,00:36:53.21,00:36:53.21,about how I'd gone out thereand basically frog-marched Colby
579,00:36:56.71,00:36:56.71,"to, uh, to the mat at the end.So it was very fulfilling."
580,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,"And at the very end, dude, Iwas, like, kind of, like, moved"
581,00:37:01.79,00:37:01.79,"him, moved him, moved him, mat.>> Bam."
582,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,(laughter)>> It was... I enjoyed every
583,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"second of that.Coach, what a surprise."
584,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,"Honestly, I'm-I'm very surprisedby Coach."
585,00:37:14.33,00:37:14.33,"There's just something abouthim, and I don't know what it"
586,00:37:17.21,00:37:17.21,is yet.I'm definitely gonna make it a
587,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,point to get to know Coach.I know I'm stealing Coach's
588,00:37:23.12,00:37:23.12,"mantra here, but I'm going intothis like a warrior."
589,00:37:25.46,00:37:25.46,'Cause that's really what youhave to do.
590,00:37:27.54,00:37:27.54,>> How did you know that was mymantra?
591,00:37:30.38,00:37:30.38,">> Uh, I heard stuff about you.>> Yeah, okay."
592,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,One thing that appeals to meabout Jerri is that she's a
593,00:37:36.08,00:37:36.08,"different kind of girl, and, uh,that interests me, because I'm"
594,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"a different kind of guy.>> Randy, I hear you chuckling"
595,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"over there.>> (laughing): No, I'm laughing"
596,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"at Colby's face.Actually, he looked a little"
597,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,scared....you don't step away from
598,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,love.If it's hitting you in the
599,00:38:11.04,00:38:11.04,"face, you grab ahold to it.You never know, man."
600,00:38:13.58,00:38:13.58,>> You never know.>> You never know.
601,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,>> I would never get in the wayof true love.
602,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,">> Go for it, dude. Go for it.>> I agree."
603,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,>> Are you talking aboutParvati?
604,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,(laughter)>> I have never in a million
605,00:38:27.38,00:38:27.38,years would think about comingout on Survivor and actually
606,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"being interested in somebody.But Jerri and I, we have a"
607,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,"little connection.>> How's it going, Coach?"
608,00:38:36.42,00:38:36.42,I'm keeping my eye on him.>> Are you guys playing Cupid?
609,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,>> Yes.You and the dragon slayer.
610,00:38:44.79,00:38:44.79,"(laughing)>> Ooh, I see romance blooming"
611,00:38:47.29,00:38:47.29,"between Jerri and Coach.And Jerri's in total denial,"
612,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"but she totally flirts, andshe's, I think, in spite of"
613,00:38:54.21,00:38:54.21,"herself, a little bit in lovewith the dragon slayer."
614,00:38:59.54,00:38:59.54,>> I'm setting you up withCoach.
615,00:39:01.38,00:39:01.38,What's the problem?You know what?
616,00:39:03.29,00:39:03.29,"Love finds you sometimes, andyou don't even know it."
617,00:39:06.25,00:39:06.25,">> Well, you do know that justby cuddling together one night,"
618,00:39:10.21,00:39:10.21,we created a whole little...>> I know.
619,00:39:12.62,00:39:12.62,>> ...controversial buzz thatcould potentially not be...
620,00:39:16.54,00:39:16.54,"I don't know.>> Well, I just think we carry"
621,00:39:18.33,00:39:18.33,"on our business.I mean, I think that if we just"
622,00:39:20.50,00:39:20.50,"go about our day and we don'thave too many talks like this,"
623,00:39:22.46,00:39:22.46,unless we're walking down thebeach that way.
624,00:39:24.12,00:39:24.12,">> I know, right?>> But it sucks, because, you"
625,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,"know, obviously, I want to talkto you."
626,00:39:29.12,00:39:29.12,">> I know, I know.>> The girls were joking about"
627,00:39:31.21,00:39:31.21,"it.They were, like, ""Oh, the black"
628,00:39:33.25,00:39:33.25,"widow and the dragon slayer--what a combination."""
629,00:39:35.08,00:39:35.08,"Hey, you never know, we mightpair up and run this game."
630,00:39:38.21,00:39:38.21,"But we need to be careful,Jerri and I, of having the"
631,00:39:41.00,00:39:41.00,appearance of being in anunbreakable alliance.
632,00:39:43.42,00:39:43.42,">> Will you promise me if Ishould worry about something,"
633,00:39:45.79,00:39:45.79,"let me know?>> Well, don't worry about"
634,00:39:47.75,00:39:47.75,anything.Okay?
635,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,">> Okay. Yeah, 'cause thelast... I hate feeling alone"
636,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,out here.>> Don't... You're not alone.
637,00:39:53.29,00:39:53.29,>> It's the worst feeling inthe world.
638,00:39:55.04,00:39:55.04,">> No, you shouldn't be worried.You're with the dragon slayer,"
639,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,man-- don't you worry aboutthat.
640,00:40:14.75,00:40:14.75,>> We got a good group.>> That's what I'm saying.
641,00:40:17.12,00:40:17.12,">> Here's the thing, this isbetween me and you right here,"
642,00:40:19.17,00:40:19.17,it's got to be.But I'm willing to make an
643,00:40:21.08,00:40:21.08,alliance right now with you.'Cause I haven't made an
644,00:40:23.08,00:40:23.08,"alliance with nobody, brother.>> Yeah."
645,00:40:25.75,00:40:25.75,>> I don't want the physicalthreat of being thrown out of
646,00:40:27.92,00:40:27.92,"here.We should never lose, man."
647,00:40:29.50,00:40:29.50,>> Yeah.>> I don't want flower power to
648,00:40:31.25,00:40:31.25,"be running over this thing likeit was, you know."
649,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,">> Hey, I went through it, so...>> I know, man."
650,00:40:35.04,00:40:35.04,">> It was terrible.>> James and I, you know, we're"
651,00:40:37.29,00:40:37.29,buddies right off the bat.We both work hard.
652,00:40:39.96,00:40:39.96,"He's a guy's guy.I mean, we can talk straight up."
653,00:40:42.50,00:40:42.50,"Anything he tells me, Ibelieve it."
654,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,Could I ever beat James if itwas me and him in the final two?
655,00:40:47.08,00:40:47.08,No. But... I don't see me andhim in the final two.
656,00:40:50.79,00:40:50.79,"I'd rather see us rock onthrough and stay strong, dude."
657,00:40:53.54,00:40:53.54,">> Yeah, let's keep the guystogether."
658,00:40:55.88,00:40:55.88,">> If we go to... That's...hey, that's the deal."
659,00:40:58.08,00:40:58.08,">> No, for real.>> I'm gonna form alliances"
660,00:41:00.42,00:41:00.42,with everyone I can.My strategy is to keep everyone
661,00:41:03.00,00:41:03.00,"on my side, man.>> Here's the thing, Candice..."
662,00:41:10.25,00:41:10.25,...for J.T. and James.>> I know that James and Amanda
663,00:41:14.38,00:41:14.38,"played together.>> I don't know them, but I"
664,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,"know that there's people that,you know..."
665,00:41:26.42,00:41:26.42,>> Yeah. That's my concern.>> The first couple of days are
666,00:41:30.17,00:41:30.17,always the worst out here.Because you don't have
667,00:41:33.21,00:41:33.21,"everything settled, you don'tknow everybody, and so it's"
668,00:41:36.75,00:41:36.75,always kind of awkward.>> What do you know about Cirie?
669,00:41:41.04,00:41:41.04,">> You mean, like, how sheplayed the game?"
670,00:41:43.04,00:41:43.04,>> I don't know anything abouther.
671,00:41:44.75,00:41:44.75,>> I don't know her.>> Yeah.
672,00:41:50.12,00:41:50.12,">> Are they friends?>> Going into the game again,"
673,00:41:54.29,00:41:54.29,"I'm worried about people whohave a history together,"
674,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,they've played on seasonsbefore together.
675,00:42:00.50,00:42:00.50,And I don't really have anyonethat I have a solid history
676,00:42:04.42,00:42:04.42,"with going into the game.>> Well, didn't take long for"
677,00:42:08.83,00:42:08.83,the game to start.>> (laughs): Yeah.
678,00:42:10.88,00:42:10.88,>> We're back again.>> I know.
679,00:42:12.88,00:42:12.88,What do you think?>> I don't know yet.
680,00:42:14.88,00:42:14.88,"What do you think?>> I don't know, I'm trying"
681,00:42:16.88,00:42:16.88,to...>> Trying to assess the
682,00:42:18.83,00:42:18.83,situation.>> Yeah. (laughs)
683,00:42:21.25,00:42:21.25,Exactly.We can't be off alone like
684,00:42:23.62,00:42:23.62,"this, though.>> James, myself, and Cirie,"
685,00:42:30.54,00:42:30.54,"you know, we've played thisgame together before."
686,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,I've played this twice withJames-- in China and Micronesia.
687,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,"I've played it once with Cirie,and Cirie and I went to the end"
688,00:42:38.08,00:42:38.08,together.We were in an alliance the
689,00:42:40.46,00:42:40.46,"whole time, so we're going tohave to watch our distance,"
690,00:42:43.00,00:42:43.00,"because if people think we'retoo chummy, it could... it could"
691,00:42:46.75,00:42:46.75,"definitely play against us.>> So, how you doing, my friend?"
692,00:42:49.62,00:42:49.62,Welcome to Samoa. (laughing)>> Thank God we're on the same
693,00:42:53.08,00:42:53.08,tribe.>> It's good to be here with you
694,00:42:54.92,00:42:54.92,"again-- yeah, that's great!It's like déjà vu, right?"
695,00:42:59.46,00:42:59.46,"So, um, hopefully, we can justrun this thing where we avoid"
696,00:43:02.67,00:43:02.67,"Tribal Council in the beginning.>> Yeah, but I'm trying to"
697,00:43:06.54,00:43:06.54,think who... who do you want toget involved with here.
698,00:43:10.38,00:43:10.38,>> Right.My closest ally is Stephenie.
699,00:43:13.96,00:43:13.96,We played well together in ourseason in Palau.
700,00:43:18.21,00:43:18.21,"And, uh, I was thrilled to seeher back here on this beach in"
701,00:43:21.25,00:43:21.25,"my tribe.I think Colby... Colby, J.T."
702,00:43:25.08,00:43:25.08,"and you would be my choice, butlike you said, we don't know"
703,00:43:27.83,00:43:27.83,what they're thinking is...>> That's what I was thinking.
704,00:43:30.04,00:43:30.04,">> I'm gonna try to work withStephenie as far as we can, but"
705,00:43:33.58,00:43:33.58,she might not be my smartestend player.
706,00:43:37.50,00:43:37.50,If I were to get that far inthe game and were to face a
707,00:43:41.12,00:43:41.12,"jury, I want somebody else whowon the million dollars to sit"
708,00:43:44.12,00:43:44.12,"next to me.So, you know, seeing you right"
709,00:43:46.33,00:43:46.33,"away, I will... you know, youwant to make some kind of an"
710,00:43:49.12,00:43:49.12,"oath, whatever.You and I need each other in the"
711,00:43:51.83,00:43:51.83,"finals, because we both wonthe money."
712,00:43:54.12,00:43:54.12,>> They have to choose one ofus.
713,00:43:56.00,00:43:56.00,">> If either one of us, nomatter how good a game we play,"
714,00:43:58.38,00:43:58.38,goes up against someone whodidn't win...
715,00:44:00.21,00:44:00.21,">> We lose.Me and you, man."
716,00:44:01.96,00:44:01.96,>> It's a good plan.>> People are expecting me to be
717,00:44:05.46,00:44:05.46,"that guy they saw on Tocantins,you know, that guy who stuck by"
718,00:44:08.04,00:44:08.04,his word and done everything hehad to do.
719,00:44:11.46,00:44:11.46,"But this game is completelydifferent, because everyone's"
720,00:44:13.58,00:44:13.58,already seen me play.>> You're my guy for the end.
721,00:44:16.62,00:44:16.62,">> All right, you got me.>> Right."
722,00:44:19.00,00:44:19.00,">> You know, I need you...and you need me."
723,00:44:21.42,00:44:21.42,">> We need each other.>> To win this game of Survivor,"
724,00:44:24.00,00:44:24.00,you have to have a dark sidesomewhere.
725,00:44:26.08,00:44:26.08,You have to be willing tosacrifice some of your
726,00:44:29.17,00:44:29.17,integrity to make it far inthis game.
727,00:44:31.92,00:44:31.92,And I'm not looking to savemy hero name.
728,00:44:34.83,00:44:34.83,I'm here to do what I have todo to win this game.
729,00:44:37.62,00:44:37.62,So it's going to be a wholedifferent ballgame for me.
730,00:44:41.79,00:44:41.79,"(sighs)>> Sandra, do you know how to"
731,00:44:53.50,00:44:53.50,do this?(laughter)
732,00:44:55.92,00:44:55.92,>> This is not working.I think I'm not going to do
733,00:44:58.58,00:44:58.58,this anymore.>> We got ten people here.
734,00:45:03.83,00:45:03.83,"They don't want to do anythingfor more than, like, ten minutes"
735,00:45:06.71,00:45:06.71,at a time.>> I know.
736,00:45:08.71,00:45:08.71,">> But nobody has any energy,because we don't have any water."
737,00:45:11.08,00:45:11.08,>> Everybody's going to be deadfor this challenge if we don't
738,00:45:13.79,00:45:13.79,get water.>> Yeah.
739,00:45:15.79,00:45:15.79,>> We have to build a fire.It's been six years since I've
740,00:45:18.71,00:45:18.71,"played the game, and a lot haschanged."
741,00:45:22.04,00:45:22.04,"Like, there's nobody here thatwants to do anything."
742,00:45:26.08,00:45:26.08,They don't want to build ashelter.
743,00:45:28.29,00:45:28.29,They don't want to try to get afire going.
744,00:45:30.67,00:45:30.67,It's not that they don't knowwhat to do-- they've all played
745,00:45:33.12,00:45:33.12,Survivor before.Sandra's won the game.

1147,01:08:24.17,01:08:24.17,immunity challenge.We had to do it because we
1148,01:08:27.04,01:08:27.04,didn't want one of our peopleto be the first to leave
1149,01:08:31.04,01:08:31.04,Heroes vs. Villains.Now we're trying to figure out
1150,01:08:35.04,01:08:35.04,who they're going to send homeand why.
1151,01:08:38.00,01:08:38.00,">> Well, Tom and Stephenie aretogether."
1152,01:08:41.08,01:08:41.08,They were together from before.James has to be with Cirie and
1153,01:08:46.12,01:08:46.12,Amanda and what's the other one?When push comes to shove and
1154,01:08:52.12,01:08:52.12,"nobody wants to go home first,it's about who all you've been"
1155,01:08:54.46,01:08:54.46,with and who you know.>> Yeah.
1156,01:08:57.17,01:08:57.17,>> What I like about it is theyall shook up now.
1157,01:08:59.21,01:08:59.21,Now they are divided.We have to divide them.
1158,01:09:03.71,01:09:03.71,The Heroes got their asseshanded to them.
1159,01:09:07.88,01:09:07.88,"And, you know what, we werehaving a good time just sitting"
1160,01:09:10.17,01:09:10.17,"back loving it.Oh, I'm happy!"
1161,01:09:13.21,01:09:13.21,">> Keep going, keep going.>> It strengthens our tribe and"
1162,01:09:16.46,01:09:16.46,it weakens the Heroes' tribe.>> We looked like a team a
1163,01:09:20.62,01:09:20.62,"little bit today.Like eight out of ten, 80%..."
1164,01:09:26.00,01:09:26.00,>> A solid B-plus.>> They got to stab somebody
1165,01:09:29.17,01:09:29.17,in the back.They're over there being
1166,01:09:31.88,01:09:31.88,villains.That's what they're doing.
1167,01:09:43.21,01:09:43.21,>> This is not good.Nobody in a million years would
1168,01:09:47.08,01:09:47.08,have guessed we are going toTribal Council on day three.
1169,01:09:50.67,01:09:50.67,"Hopefully, this loss doesnothing to our momentum other"
1170,01:09:55.17,01:09:55.17,than show us that we'revulnerable.
1171,01:09:59.12,01:09:59.12,They might be a little moresneaky and a little more game
1172,01:10:01.38,01:10:01.38,"playey and a little more damnpuzzle oriented, and that's"
1173,01:10:05.08,01:10:05.08,"fine.>> Well, they wanted it pretty"
1174,01:10:07.17,01:10:07.17,bad.>> They needed it.
1175,01:10:09.17,01:10:09.17,>> Yeah.>> And we were a little cocky.
1176,01:10:12.50,01:10:12.50,We walked in there like theheroes.
1177,01:10:14.58,01:10:14.58,"You know, there's big ""S's"" onall of our chests."
1178,01:10:20.62,01:10:20.62,This Heroes vs. Villains isgoing to be a tough one.
1179,01:10:26.25,01:10:26.25,"When we thought we had it inthe bag, they showed us we"
1180,01:10:30.17,01:10:30.17,don't.>> You guys want some coconuts?
1181,01:10:40.12,01:10:40.12,>> Neither was I.>> What do you think?
1182,01:10:45.75,01:10:45.75,>> Amanda?>> Okay.
1183,01:10:48.12,01:10:48.12,">> Okay, we all...?Well, that's fine with me."
1184,01:10:50.46,01:10:50.46,As long as it's not me.>> It's freaking awesome with
1185,01:10:53.25,01:10:53.25,me. Please.>> Okay.
1186,01:10:55.08,01:10:55.08,">> When we lost, I felt really,really awful."
1187,01:10:57.96,01:10:57.96,"I helped us lose, I guess,because I was on the puzzle,"
1188,01:11:00.29,01:11:00.29,and I felt bad because we hadsuch a good lead before.
1189,01:11:03.21,01:11:03.21,I just was disappointed inmyself.
1190,01:11:06.96,01:11:06.96,And scared.I don't want to talk to anyone.
1191,01:11:11.08,01:11:11.08,">> Me, either.>> I'm so depressed right now."
1192,01:11:14.12,01:11:14.12,"(laughing)These are all people, some of"
1193,01:11:18.62,01:11:18.62,"them have all played togetherbefore, and they're really good."
1194,01:11:22.25,01:11:22.25,"And I think that Amanda andJames are together, so we have"
1195,01:11:25.25,01:11:25.25,"to break that up, if at allpossible."
1196,01:11:36.71,01:11:36.71,>> This isn't a bad thing.>> No.
1197,01:11:38.75,01:11:38.75,>> I think Sugar.I think everyone's thinking
1198,01:11:40.75,01:11:40.75,Sugar.>> Yeah.
1199,01:11:56.58,01:11:56.58,>> Is that done?>> Yeah.
1200,01:11:58.46,01:11:58.46,>> Yeah?>> Yeah.
1201,01:12:00.25,01:12:00.25,>> What are you thinking?>> I'm thinking that you have a
1202,01:12:03.04,01:12:03.04,follower and you got one ofthe smartest strategic players
1203,01:12:06.50,01:12:06.50,in the game.Why are we taking out the
1204,01:12:08.54,01:12:08.54,follower instead of thestrategic player?
1205,01:12:10.71,01:12:10.71,"Cirie...>> Oh, Cirie?"
1206,01:12:12.33,01:12:12.33,>> ...has run this game a fewtimes. So...
1207,01:12:15.92,01:12:15.92,"I really believe that when youidentify a threat, you take them"
1208,01:12:18.92,01:12:18.92,out as soon as possible.You don't wait.
1209,01:12:21.96,01:12:21.96,"People did that on my season,and they waited too long, and"
1210,01:12:24.38,01:12:24.38,then they didn't get theopportunity to get rid of me.
1211,01:12:26.75,01:12:26.75,So I don't want to have thoseregrets that those people had.
1212,01:12:30.17,01:12:30.17,>> I have no problem.>> Just a thought.
1213,01:12:32.96,01:12:32.96,Just a thought.>> I'm down with that.
1214,01:12:35.00,01:12:35.00,>> Cirie is just a brilliantstrategist in the game.
1215,01:12:38.12,01:12:38.12,"She's proven that, so I'm justa little nervous to give her a"
1216,01:12:41.25,01:12:41.25,bye tonight.>> So I told you three my
1217,01:12:53.58,01:12:53.58,concerns about Cirie.>> Cirie-- I worry about her the
1218,01:12:56.46,01:12:56.46,most.>> Right.
1219,01:12:58.38,01:12:58.38,">> Cirie's tricky.>> So, who are we voting for?"
1220,01:13:05.17,01:13:05.17,That's what I'm...>> I like Sugar...
1221,01:13:07.33,01:13:07.33,>> They're voting for Sugar?>> Who's voting for Sugar?
1222,01:13:09.67,01:13:09.67,>> The other group.>> Do we need to break up Tom
1223,01:13:12.38,01:13:12.38,and Stephenie?>> I agree.
1224,01:13:14.75,01:13:14.75,Because why waste a vote?And you're not going to be able
1225,01:13:17.75,01:13:17.75,"to get him later.So, what are we doing? Tom?"
1226,01:13:19.83,01:13:19.83,>> Tom or Stephenie.I'm good with either one.
1227,01:13:21.71,01:13:21.71,">> You got to make a decisionwhich one before we go back,"
1228,01:13:23.88,01:13:23.88,'cause we're not going to beable to talk again.
1229,01:13:27.46,01:13:27.46,">> Word on the street is, Sugaris supposed to go tonight."
1230,01:13:30.12,01:13:30.12,"Why Sugar?Sugar, yes, she's annoying,"
1231,01:13:32.25,01:13:32.25,"which is even a better reasonfor me to keep her around,"
1232,01:13:36.12,01:13:36.12,because as long as there'ssomebody annoying and
1233,01:13:38.08,01:13:38.08,"somebody... less strong than Iam, then that takes the target"
1234,01:13:42.04,01:13:42.04,off of me.So if we could get one of the
1235,01:13:46.83,01:13:46.83,"stronger players out, like Tomor Stephenie, that would be"
1236,01:13:49.83,01:13:49.83,better for me.So I'd rather not have Sugar go
1237,01:13:51.88,01:13:51.88,"tonight.My concern is, if we don't"
1238,01:13:57.17,01:13:57.17,"knock one of them out, likeStephenie, who ca..."
1239,01:14:00.12,01:14:00.12,We're going to lose challengeswithout Stephenie?
1240,01:14:02.17,01:14:02.17,>> Maybe.She's a really strong swimmer.
1241,01:14:05.17,01:14:05.17,>> And can't-- and Sugar is not?>> I don't think so.
1242,01:14:08.21,01:14:08.21,>> I don't know.I'm just... you know...
1243,01:14:12.08,01:14:12.08,>> There is an advantage ofkeeping Stephenie right now and
1244,01:14:15.12,01:14:15.12,"getting rid of Sugar,physically, like, for the"
1245,01:14:17.17,01:14:17.17,"challenges.But strategically, Stephenie"
1246,01:14:20.17,01:14:20.17,has got game and she has to go.You think Stephenie?
1247,01:14:23.21,01:14:23.21,>> The smartest... the smartestmove right now would be
1248,01:14:25.96,01:14:25.96,"Stephenie.I mean, think about it."
1249,01:14:28.08,01:14:28.08,"We want to make moves that'sgonna guarantee us, you know,"
1250,01:14:31.54,01:14:31.54,"getting further in this game.>> It's so hard, because you"
1251,01:14:36.21,01:14:36.21,"want to keep your team strong,but strategically, you have to"
1252,01:14:38.75,01:14:38.75,put yourself in a good position.Either you're doing it for
