1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: The South
2,00:00:10.00,00:00:10.00,Pacific. Thousands of islands
3,00:00:19.29,00:00:19.29,lay scattered across the world's most beautiful ocean.
4,00:00:28.25,00:00:28.25,"But for centuries, man has traveled these waters to meet"
5,00:00:32.25,00:00:32.25,in combat. From brutal tribal warfare to
6,00:00:38.67,00:00:38.67,"the the epic battles of World War II, this is a place where"
7,00:00:43.25,00:00:43.25,rivals have long traveled to settle old scores.
8,00:00:47.75,00:00:47.75,It is the perfect setting for our biggest showdown yet.
9,00:00:52.17,00:00:52.17,Welcome to the 20th season of Survivor.
10,00:00:57.21,00:00:57.21,"Over the past ten years, Survivor has traveled to some"
11,00:00:59.92,00:00:59.92,"of the most desolate, dangerous and exotic places"
12,00:01:04.17,00:01:04.17,in the world. (bird calling)
13,00:01:10.04,00:01:10.04,Over 300 people have tested themselves in the most
14,00:01:14.08,00:01:14.08,difficult and groundbreaking show on television.
15,00:01:21.62,00:01:21.62,We have gathered 20 of them to play one more time.
16,00:01:53.75,00:01:53.75,These are ten of your favorite heroes...
17,00:01:57.12,00:01:57.12,versus ten of the most notorious villains.
18,00:02:03.58,00:02:03.58,">> In my world, I've always tried to show that good"
19,00:02:08.12,00:02:08.12,will win. >> I'm a villain.
20,00:02:14.00,00:02:14.00,I think villains are smarter than heroes because they don't
21,00:02:17.25,00:02:17.25,mind stabbing somebody in the back to get where they want
22,00:02:21.62,00:02:21.62,to get. It's a fact.
23,00:02:23.62,00:02:23.62,It's a proven fact. Google it.
24,00:02:29.17,00:02:29.17,>> The Heroes are definitely people I would rather play the
25,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,game with. The Villains are the people
26,00:02:34.04,00:02:34.04,I've always been against. So this is perfect for me to be
27,00:02:37.50,00:02:37.50,on the heroes' side and battle it out against these punks I
28,00:02:40.21,00:02:40.21,don't like anyway. >> I've been labeled things
29,00:02:44.50,00:02:44.50,"like ""She-devil in a blue bikini,"" ""The wicked witch of"
30,00:02:48.50,00:02:48.50,"the West."" ""Man-eater Manthey""-- that was"
31,00:02:51.46,00:02:51.46,my favorite one. (chuckles)
32,00:02:58.25,00:02:58.25,>> I'm back here to do what I came to do the first time-- get
33,00:03:01.50,00:03:01.50,to the end and make the money. So I'm definitely coming back
34,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,"to redeem myself. >> This time, I slay everyone"
35,00:03:12.08,00:03:12.08,and trust no one. This is my chance for
36,00:03:13.92,00:03:13.92,redemption. >> I'm not in the shape I was
37,00:03:17.79,00:03:17.79,"last time, but I still think that I could hang in there as"
38,00:03:21.92,00:03:21.92,tough as any guy next to me. >> But these people are
39,00:03:26.08,00:03:26.08,"smart, they'll get rid of me right right away."
40,00:03:28.58,00:03:28.58,"It's the smartest thing they could do, but they won't."
41,00:03:31.54,00:03:31.54,They never do. >> I'm almost a decade older
42,00:03:36.04,00:03:36.04,"than I was the first time. So to me, it's a test to see if"
43,00:03:40.29,00:03:40.29,"I still got it. >> Last time I was mean, and"
44,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,"this time I'm meaner. You know, I'll lie."
45,00:03:47.08,00:03:47.08,I don't care. But I'll make up a good lie.
46,00:03:53.42,00:03:53.42,>> People think they know me. They really don't know me.
47,00:03:58.17,00:03:58.17,(laughing) I'm a gangster in a Oprah suit.
48,00:04:02.04,00:04:02.04,"But I'm not, like, a mean gangster."
49,00:04:05.67,00:04:05.67,"I'm a nice gangster with a smile, you know."
50,00:04:08.33,00:04:08.33,>> PROBST: it is still the ultimate challenge:
51,00:04:11.12,00:04:11.12,20 people forced to work together while battling the
52,00:04:14.92,00:04:14.92,elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or
53,00:04:18.46,00:04:18.46,"they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will"
54,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,remain to claim the million-dollar prize.
55,00:04:25.08,00:04:25.08,"39 days, 20 people, one survivor."
56,00:04:41.12,00:04:41.12,(theme song playing) \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
57,00:05:55.00,00:05:55.00,">> Flying in the choppers, my heart's beating a mile a minute."
58,00:06:00.50,00:06:00.50,I'm sitting right next to Tom and Cirie and all these people.
59,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,I know the game's going. I'm finally back in the game.
60,00:06:12.29,00:06:12.29,">> Flying in on the helicopter, you can feel something"
61,00:06:15.33,00:06:15.33,in the air. There's an electricity.
62,00:06:18.88,00:06:18.88,There's a tension. There's a level of excitement
63,00:06:22.46,00:06:22.46,"that is coursing through everybody's veins,"
64,00:06:25.92,00:06:25.92,"especially mine. And to start off like that, I"
65,00:06:28.92,00:06:28.92,think sets a great tone for how the season is gonna be.
66,00:06:34.88,00:06:34.88,">> Believe it or not, I'm a little nervous going in."
67,00:06:37.96,00:06:37.96,I'm still in awe of who I'm here with.
68,00:06:40.46,00:06:40.46,"I mean, for God's sake, Boston Rob..."
69,00:06:43.54,00:06:43.54,"Parvati. I mean, you know, I gotta"
70,00:06:46.62,00:06:46.62,get my mind straight and not let them get me too starstruck.
71,00:06:50.83,00:06:50.83,I'm out here playing a game with them now.
72,00:07:00.04,00:07:00.04,">> I'm nervous and I'm excited. And, you know, like before you"
73,00:07:04.25,00:07:04.25,"bungee jump or something, you get that knot in your stomach,"
74,00:07:07.21,00:07:07.21,"and it, like, makes you want to throw up, kind of?"
75,00:07:10.50,00:07:10.50,That's how I feel right now. >> I look over and see my
76,00:07:30.04,00:07:30.04,fellow tribemates with the blue buff on getting out of their
77,00:07:33.42,00:07:33.42,"copter and running over. It's pretty intense, you know?"
78,00:07:36.88,00:07:36.88,"My tribe, the Heroes tribe, they're hard-working, you know,"
79,00:07:40.54,00:07:40.54,"tough guys, good people. I was like, you know,"
80,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,"""This is it."" I can't wait to kick some"
81,00:07:46.62,00:07:46.62,ass out here. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
82,00:08:32.92,00:08:32.92,">> Here we are, we're on our nice little blue mat, and then"
83,00:08:36.12,00:08:36.12,"here come these Villains, and you see, you see Boston Rob,"
84,00:08:40.62,00:08:40.62,"and he's already got the whole, the walk and the swagger and"
85,00:08:44.88,00:08:44.88,"the attitude. And then, you know, you see"
86,00:08:47.04,00:08:47.04,"Coach and Jerri. I mean, they really"
87,00:08:50.42,00:08:50.42,are villains. >> Yay!
88,00:08:51.46,00:08:51.46,I'm the original villainess of Survivor and I gotta tell you
89,00:08:54.12,00:08:54.12,I feel like Mother Teresa right now with these people.
90,00:08:58.04,00:08:58.04,(laughs) It's on.
91,00:09:10.33,00:09:10.33,">> PROBST: All right, let me officially welcome you to"
92,00:09:14.88,00:09:14.88,Survivor 20: Heroes vs. Villains.
93,00:09:21.25,00:09:21.25,"(laughter) >> Yeah, baby! Whoo!"
94,00:09:26.17,00:09:26.17,">> PROBST: Ten years, 20 seasons, over 300 people have"
95,00:09:31.04,00:09:31.04,"played Survivor, the greatest adventure game in the history"
96,00:09:33.83,00:09:33.83,"of television. Russell, how does it feel to be"
97,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,deemed one of the ten most notorious of all time?
98,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,>> I'm still in awe that I'm here with...
99,00:09:47.25,00:09:47.25,"with all these great players. Finally, I can play the game."
100,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,with somebody that respects the game.
101,00:09:51.29,00:09:51.29,">> PROBST: Boston Rob, you proud to be seen as one of the"
102,00:09:55.58,00:09:55.58,ten biggest villains of all time?
103,00:09:58.62,00:09:58.62,>> I'm a villain? (all laughing)
104,00:10:02.46,00:10:02.46,"Well, it's all in perspective, I guess."
105,00:10:04.79,00:10:04.79,"It's how you see it. >> PROBST: Rupert, a lot of"
106,00:10:08.17,00:10:08.17,people have played this game. >> Yup.
107,00:10:10.71,00:10:10.71,">> PROBST: You're still, to this day, one of the"
108,00:10:13.88,00:10:13.88,"most popular. >> Uh, it's, it's been"
109,00:10:16.08,00:10:16.08,an honor since the first time that I got to play.
110,00:10:18.71,00:10:18.71,"And now when I found out I'm on the Heroes' side, I tell"
111,00:10:23.12,00:10:23.12,"you, I love the game, and being able to have this chance,"
112,00:10:27.67,00:10:27.67,"it's, it's an honor. >> PROBST: Tom, another big"
113,00:10:30.46,00:10:30.46,"hero, played a very solid game. A lot of people like you."
114,00:10:34.00,00:10:34.00,"They were happy you won, which isn't always the case with some"
115,00:10:37.42,00:10:37.42,of our winners. Stack up these two tribes.
116,00:10:40.96,00:10:40.96,">> You know, we kind of got maybe some positive energy"
117,00:10:43.17,00:10:43.17,"going just 'cause we've been labeled the good guys, but, um,"
118,00:10:46.38,00:10:46.38,I also wouldn't assume that anybody would stick with the
119,00:10:48.79,00:10:48.79,game-play that they had. If it didn't work for them in a
120,00:10:51.17,00:10:51.17,"previous season, I would say that they might do a 180 on this"
121,00:10:54.04,00:10:54.04,"thing and spin it around, and I think that could be from"
122,00:10:57.71,00:10:57.71,"either tribe. >> PROBST: Colby, in your"
123,00:10:59.83,00:10:59.83,"season, Survivor: Australia, our second season,"
124,00:11:03.75,00:11:03.75,"going back almost ten years ago, you were so popular, people"
125,00:11:06.79,00:11:06.79,"were naming their children ""Colby."""
126,00:11:10.21,00:11:10.21,(laughter) >> Most of the ones I heard
127,00:11:11.71,00:11:11.71,"about named their dogs ""Colby."" (laughter)"
128,00:11:14.21,00:11:14.21,So a kid's not bad. I'll take that.
129,00:11:16.08,00:11:16.08,">> PROBST: What's the perspective now, almost"
130,00:11:18.21,00:11:18.21,ten years later? >> It's taken me almost this
131,00:11:20.75,00:11:20.75,"long to really get enough perspective to appreciate it,"
132,00:11:25.38,00:11:25.38,"and this is, this is my third time back, and it is,"
133,00:11:28.12,00:11:28.12,it is humbling. It's the experience and it's
134,00:11:30.75,00:11:30.75,the adventure. If you're not fired up at this
135,00:11:33.83,00:11:33.83,"point riding in on those birds, you don't have a pulse."
136,00:11:36.38,00:11:36.38,">> PROBST: J.T., is it at all intimidating, even within"
137,00:11:39.25,00:11:39.25,"your own tribe, when you look around at who's"
138,00:11:42.33,00:11:42.33,surrounding you? >> It's definitely intimidating.
139,00:11:44.08,00:11:44.08,I watched these people when I was in high school.
140,00:11:46.12,00:11:46.12,"I was too young to apply for the show, so I couldn't do it,"
141,00:11:48.62,00:11:48.62,and now I'm out here competing against them.
142,00:11:51.21,00:11:51.21,And I'm still a rookie out here. I'm probably the youngest one
143,00:11:53.71,00:11:53.71,out here. I feel like a young kid against
144,00:11:55.33,00:11:55.33,"these people, but I'm ready. >> PROBST: Anybody out here"
145,00:11:57.62,00:11:57.62,"feel they are on the wrong tribe, legitimately feel"
146,00:12:01.17,00:12:01.17,"they're on the wrong tribe? >> Oh, yeah."
147,00:12:04.08,00:12:04.08,">> What'd we do? >> Yeah, what did we do?"
148,00:12:06.50,00:12:06.50,>> What did we do that was so bad?
149,00:12:07.92,00:12:07.92,>> PROBST: So pretty much every Villain thinks they should be
150,00:12:09.92,00:12:09.92,on the Hero tribe. (laughter)
151,00:12:11.54,00:12:11.54,"Except Jerri Manthey, the original black widow, still"
152,00:12:14.58,00:12:14.58,owning her title. >> I even got a black hat for
153,00:12:18.92,00:12:18.92,this season. >> Is there a little symbolism
154,00:12:21.92,00:12:21.92,with her hat being black and mine being white?
155,00:12:23.38,00:12:23.38,>> PROBST: Good versus evil? >> It was not a mistake.
156,00:12:27.21,00:12:27.21,">> PROBST: Parvati, let's be clear; while you did a great"
157,00:12:30.75,00:12:30.75,"job and were rewarded with a million dollars, you led one of"
158,00:12:35.29,00:12:35.29,the most notorious tribe of women ever in the history
159,00:12:38.62,00:12:38.62,of the game. You betrayed people left
160,00:12:40.75,00:12:40.75,and right. You guys were responsible for
161,00:12:42.88,00:12:42.88,"many, many blindsides. Great player?"
162,00:12:46.08,00:12:46.08,"Yes, that's why you're here. Hero? No."
163,00:12:49.25,00:12:49.25,"James, from your two cents-- Parvati, hero or villain?"
164,00:12:52.62,00:12:52.62,>> Villain. (laughter)
165,00:12:55.04,00:12:55.04,>> PROBST: James is bigger than me.
166,00:12:57.25,00:12:57.25,James is right. >> I will fight him.
167,00:12:59.42,00:12:59.42,I'm not scared of him. (laughs)
168,00:13:02.17,00:13:02.17,I don't care how big you are. >> Uh-huh.
169,00:13:03.25,00:13:03.25,>> PROBST: Anybody here willing to say that the sheer size of
170,00:13:05.17,00:13:05.17,James does make them take pause for a moment?
171,00:13:07.88,00:13:07.88,>> Yes. >> Yes.
172,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,>> I don't want to wrestle him. >> Hello?
173,00:13:13.42,00:13:13.42,">> PROBST: James, anybody on the Villain tribe"
174,00:13:15.71,00:13:15.71,intimidate you? >> It's the same story every
175,00:13:18.71,00:13:18.71,every time. The talkers are the most
176,00:13:21.04,00:13:21.04,dangerous. The ones who strategize are the
177,00:13:24.08,00:13:24.08,best ones at the game. They-- bar none-- have won most
178,00:13:26.75,00:13:26.75,"of the series, most of the seasons."
179,00:13:28.83,00:13:28.83,>> PROBST: So you've learned something in your two times
180,00:13:30.88,00:13:30.88,"out here. >> Believe it or not, I have."
181,00:13:32.54,00:13:32.54,>> PROBST: Going back to when you were voted out with two
182,00:13:34.29,00:13:34.29,"idols, one in each pocket. (James laughs)"
183,00:13:36.75,00:13:36.75,">> Yes, thanks for reminding me. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, how big"
184,00:13:39.75,00:13:39.75,a factor is size versus scrap? >> I-I think that we have a huge
185,00:13:45.21,00:13:45.21,advantage over them. Our women are clearly stronger
186,00:13:49.25,00:13:49.25,than their women. And our guys can hold the best
187,00:13:52.12,00:13:52.12,"of it. >> Yes, yes."

378,00:25:33.17,00:25:33.17,Rob. It's James and Rob.
379,00:25:35.46,00:25:35.46,"Rob tries to take James, can't do it!"
380,00:25:41.71,00:25:41.71,James scores! Heroes win reward!
381,00:25:53.04,00:25:53.04,">> When I came out of that final heat, my toe, instead of going"
382,00:25:56.54,00:25:56.54,"up and down, went like a ""J."" My toe is broke."
383,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,">> Oh, my God. >> I can feel it."
384,00:26:04.25,00:26:04.25,"Not that one, this one. >> We'll fix you with codeine."
385,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,(Rupert gasps) >> There we go.
386,00:26:12.17,00:26:12.17,"That's stuck in now. >> My toe is broke, and I felt"
387,00:26:13.46,00:26:13.46,it cracking inside. But I'm not getting put out of
388,00:26:18.00,00:26:18.00,this game over a damn toe. First damn day.
389,00:26:25.08,00:26:25.08,">> PROBST: All right, so let's do an injury count."
390,00:26:28.08,00:26:28.08,"Rupert has a broken toe, Stephenie has a dislocated and"
391,00:26:31.71,00:26:31.71,"then relocated shoulder. Hopefully, it was worth it."
392,00:26:36.58,00:26:36.58,Big victory for the Heroes. Fire.
393,00:26:39.04,00:26:39.04,"And a map to your new home. Villains, you are definitely"
394,00:26:45.12,00:26:45.12,"living up to your name. Grab your stuff, head to your"
395,00:26:49.21,00:26:49.21,camp and start working on on shelter.
396,00:26:50.25,00:26:50.25,>> The Villains lost. You think that really bothers
397,00:26:54.92,00:26:54.92,"me, losing? 'Cause I'm used to losing with"
398,00:26:58.08,00:26:58.08,a bunch of dummies. But the difference is this
399,00:27:00.17,00:27:00.17,ain't a bunch of dummies. We will win.
400,00:27:03.08,00:27:03.08,And I'm looking forward to sending the Heroes to Tribal
401,00:27:07.62,00:27:07.62,Council and letting them do their hero thing.
402,00:27:23.08,00:27:23.08,>> Look what we've got here. We've got fins.
403,00:27:25.42,00:27:25.42,">> Fins, and is there a sling in here, or not?"
404,00:27:28.92,00:27:28.92,>> Fins! >> There's a...
405,00:27:31.50,00:27:31.50,">> Yeah, that's it. >> What?"
406,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,>> You gotta make your own out of a stick.
407,00:27:35.25,00:27:35.25,>> Make it. >> I can't believe I'm doing
408,00:27:36.71,00:27:36.71,this again. It's just starting to sink in.
409,00:27:38.38,00:27:38.38,I believe I'm going to have to stay on my toes with these
410,00:27:40.04,00:27:40.04,fellas. I'm ready for it.
411,00:27:42.04,00:27:42.04,I'm ready for the challenge. >> I think that we should live
412,00:27:45.12,00:27:45.12,under this tree because it's it's dry.
413,00:27:47.62,00:27:47.62,">> That's what I'm, that's what I'm thinking."
414,00:27:50.08,00:27:50.08,"This is, like, the biggest tree right here, right?"
415,00:27:55.38,00:27:55.38,">> I am, yeah, really bad. >> Really?"
416,00:27:57.12,00:27:57.12,>> I got about ten bites already.
417,00:27:59.00,00:27:59.00,>> They like that dragon blood. (laughter)
418,00:28:00.54,00:28:00.54, >> I got way more to prove right here than I did the
419,00:28:03.21,00:28:03.21,"last time. If I could do it here, if I can"
420,00:28:06.25,00:28:06.25,"take it all the way, if I can whup these all-stars, doesn't"
421,00:28:09.83,00:28:09.83,that mean I'm the best ever? >> I'm gonna play similar
422,00:28:21.42,00:28:21.42,to the same game. I'm gonna use the mind game.
423,00:28:25.25,00:28:25.25,They better give it their all and play the game because
424,00:28:30.88,00:28:30.88,I'm taking this crap serious. That's why I'm here.
425,00:28:34.58,00:28:34.58,"I have to work my magic on, on the villain side, which is"
426,00:28:38.17,00:28:38.17,gonna be tough. I'm gonna be straight up
427,00:28:43.50,00:28:43.50,with you. >> Yeah.
428,00:28:46.25,00:28:46.25,">> Yeah, so do I. >> I'm an aggressive player."
429,00:28:50.96,00:28:50.96,"I'm here to win, and, you know, I want to make smart alliances."
430,00:28:54.33,00:28:54.33,">> The thing is, if we can trust each other and we can do"
431,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,this... which I trust you. >> Yeah.
432,00:28:58.88,00:28:58.88,">> ...which, I trust you. >> Yeah, I trust you, too."
433,00:29:00.21,00:29:00.21,>> You have to trust me. You have to no matter what.
434,00:29:02.83,00:29:02.83,>> I know. >> Because that's the whole name
435,00:29:04.83,00:29:04.83,"of the game. >> I know, I know."
436,00:29:06.29,00:29:06.29,>> And this is where it happens the first day.
437,00:29:08.29,00:29:08.29,"This is when it happens. >> Sure, I know."
438,00:29:09.33,00:29:09.33,">> With Russell, he's a great person to play this game with."
439,00:29:12.33,00:29:12.33,He knows exactly what he's he's doing.
440,00:29:14.38,00:29:14.38,I'm going with my gut and I think that I-I should stick with
441,00:29:17.25,00:29:17.25,him until it gets to a point where I feel like he'd
442,00:29:19.75,00:29:19.75,turn on me. >> I know.
443,00:29:23.71,00:29:23.71,">> I'll do whatever it takes to get to the top, but what I'm"
444,00:29:26.08,00:29:26.08,telling you is... >> Yeah.
445,00:29:26.92,00:29:26.92,>> ...is I want to get to the top with you.
446,00:29:28.79,00:29:28.79,>> Yeah. >> We are going to be better of
447,00:29:31.04,00:29:31.04,a pair than you can even possibly imagine.
448,00:29:32.54,00:29:32.54,>> I agree. ...period.
449,00:29:38.83,00:29:38.83,"That's what I really, really want."
450,00:29:41.29,00:29:41.29,>> And I can swing it. >> I clearly know that Russell
451,00:29:57.92,00:29:57.92,is running around talking to everyone and telling everyone
452,00:30:00.25,00:30:00.25,"the same thing, but we can either work with each other or"
453,00:30:03.83,00:30:03.83,"against each other, and I do not want to work against him."
454,00:30:07.50,00:30:07.50,Are you kidding? He's just an incredible force.
455,00:30:13.71,00:30:13.71,">> I do. >> With Russell, I definitely"
456,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,"feel like I am making a deal with the devil, but I want the"
457,00:30:29.04,00:30:29.04,"devil on my side. >> These are all-stars, but you"
458,00:30:31.83,00:30:31.83,know what? I'm a little above that.
459,00:30:34.04,00:30:34.04,"Like Michael Jordan is in basketball, like Michael Phelps"
460,00:30:37.83,00:30:37.83,is in swimming. There's always somebody that's
461,00:30:40.25,00:30:40.25,above their sport. And I'm the best player
462,00:30:45.92,00:30:45.92,that ever played this game. Now guess what?
463,00:30:49.00,00:30:49.00,I get to prove it. (chuckles)
464,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,>> Sweet! >> All right!
465,00:31:08.25,00:31:08.25,"Nice! >> Man, we got a net."
466,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,>> Wow! We have a net?
467,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,">> A net! Oh, sweet. >> Well, here we are, guys."
468,00:31:16.42,00:31:16.42,>> Here we are. >> Heroes?
469,00:31:20.58,00:31:20.58,>> We're heroes! >> Yeah!
470,00:31:22.33,00:31:22.33,>> Heroes! (laughter)
471,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,">> ""Return, revenge and redemption."""
472,00:31:25.96,00:31:25.96,>> Well... >> All right.
473,00:31:27.12,00:31:27.12,>> Shall we take a celebratory dip?
474,00:31:29.21,00:31:29.21,>> Yes. >> I think so.
475,00:31:30.83,00:31:30.83,>> It takes a little bit to get back into the rhythm of
476,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,"Survivor and go, ""All right, I ""remember this."
477,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,"It's gonna be miserable."" A little chillier than you'd"
478,00:31:39.25,00:31:39.25,"think, isn't it? But you just don't remember"
479,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,what it feels like to be stranded and know you're just
480,00:31:44.21,00:31:44.21,"at the tip, you're at the beginning of a long journey,"
481,00:31:46.92,00:31:46.92,if you're lucky. >> It's got to be the best
482,00:31:50.38,00:31:50.38,first-day challenge I've ever seen in any Survivor.
483,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,Sugar got topless. (laughter)
484,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,"Stephenie dislocated her shoulder and put it back in,"
485,00:31:58.25,00:31:58.25,and Rupert broke one toe in three places.
486,00:32:01.33,00:32:01.33,">> You know, the challenge, I think our team showed its"
487,00:32:05.62,00:32:05.62,"it's strength. Unfortunately, I didn't."
488,00:32:07.50,00:32:07.50,"You know, the challenge was rough for me."
489,00:32:09.33,00:32:09.33,"I don't like losing at anything, and I got beat by"
490,00:32:11.92,00:32:11.92,"Coach. So I'm so rusty on the game,"
491,00:32:15.54,00:32:15.54,but I'm having a good time. >> We're making our first group
492,00:32:18.25,00:32:18.25,"decision. >> Oh, goody!"
493,00:32:20.04,00:32:20.04,">> I mean, we can just build something really quick"
494,00:32:22.67,00:32:22.67,"right now. Yeah, we can always move it."
495,00:32:25.42,00:32:25.42,">> Um, the two oldest men... >> Oh, no, no, no!"
496,00:32:28.38,00:32:28.38,">> can we have, can we...? (laughter)"
497,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,"can we just...? >> The two older men, could"
498,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,you guys keep your opinions to yourself?
499,00:32:38.67,00:32:38.67,">> We're all kids, and we don't know anything."
500,00:32:40.88,00:32:40.88,So-- what do you guys think? Is it better to have more bugs
501,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,in the jungle or would it be too cold out here or can we
502,00:32:47.88,00:32:47.88,just build a shelter to block the wind?
503,00:32:50.04,00:32:50.04,>> I say here. >> I say front.
504,00:32:52.71,00:32:52.71,All for here? >> We'll have a fire.
505,00:32:55.62,00:32:55.62,>> We can start a fire in the rain.
506,00:32:58.17,00:32:58.17,>> All right. >> Yay!
507,00:33:10.04,00:33:10.04,">> Wow, this is light. There you go!"
508,00:33:18.00,00:33:18.00,"Get it, girl! >> I love my tribe."
509,00:33:20.42,00:33:20.42,We have a good aura. We have good energy.
510,00:33:22.50,00:33:22.50,"You know, we all have a good work ethic."
511,00:33:24.33,00:33:24.33,"If you just wanna help, like, start putting 'em up, maybe, I"
512,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,"guess, right? >> Yeah."
513,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,">> We know what needs to be done, and we work together,"
514,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,and I feel really lucky to be on the Heroes' side and to have
515,00:33:33.71,00:33:33.71,the team I have. >> I think we should use the
516,00:33:36.42,00:33:36.42,"big ones, maybe, for the top, higher up, so it could be"
517,00:33:40.00,00:33:40.00,"more... Like, everything was going"
518,00:33:41.92,00:33:41.92,right. We have good karma right now.
519,00:33:44.33,00:33:44.33,It's great. >> You know what we need?
520,00:33:50.33,00:33:50.33,"Like, the post to split the coconut husk on."
521,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,"You got to get, like, a short, pointy..."
522,00:33:57.96,00:33:57.96,"(chicken clucking) Thought I heard some clucking,"
523,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"and went around and looked in the bush, and I see some"
524,00:34:03.50,00:34:03.50,"movement out of the corner of my eye, and here comes a"
525,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,"rooster, three hens, walking right out."
526,00:34:10.08,00:34:10.08,"Guys, look at this. There are at least three"
527,00:34:13.46,00:34:13.46,chickens right here. >> Chicken?
528,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,">> Stay right here, Tom. I'm gonna go around the"
529,00:34:16.96,00:34:16.96,other side. >> Here's another one
530,00:34:19.00,00:34:19.00,"right here. >> Great, we got four chickens."
531,00:34:21.08,00:34:21.08,There's another one. >> Yep.
532,00:34:21.92,00:34:21.92,">> Well, we got three people still, so anybody that can catch"
533,00:34:25.00,00:34:25.00,"a chicken, come this way. >> Go around the back, guys,"
534,00:34:27.04,00:34:27.04,and draw them out towards us. >> Does he have the net?
535,00:34:30.54,00:34:30.54,">> Yeah, grab that fishing net, would be great."
536,00:34:32.71,00:34:32.71,>> Bring it up. Everybody who's free should
537,00:34:38.83,00:34:38.83,"just surround them. Hey, uh..."
538,00:34:44.79,00:34:44.79,"how about if we have four of us go, like, one, two, and then"
539,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,"just throw it out like this? >> So, are you ready?"
540,00:34:51.46,00:34:51.46,">> Don't overthrow. >> Shh, shh, shh."
541,00:34:53.83,00:34:53.83,>> Are we gonna throw it on three?
542,00:34:56.00,00:34:56.00,>> We're gonna throw it on three.
543,00:34:57.83,00:34:57.83,>> ...two... We're just practicing.
544,00:35:00.12,00:35:00.12,">> ...three. >> Yeah, baby!"
545,00:35:02.21,00:35:02.21,">> No, it's getting away! >> Got it, got it!"
546,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,">> You got it, man. (chickens clucking)"
547,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,(whooping) >> We got ourselves chicken!
548,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,">> Winner, winner, chicken dinner!"
549,00:35:12.42,00:35:12.42,">> Yeah! Winner, winner, chicken dinner!"
550,00:35:15.04,00:35:15.04,">> I have seen my share of chickens, and I've caught my"
551,00:35:18.21,00:35:18.21,"share of 'em, but never in the wild, and to actually, you know,"
552,00:35:21.92,00:35:21.92,"catch them successfully, all four of them, that's"
553,00:35:24.29,00:35:24.29,"incredible. >> Oh, my God."
554,00:35:26.92,00:35:26.92,I don't believe it. >> I know.
555,00:35:29.50,00:35:29.50,">> Oh, my God, you guys! >> Nice work."
556,00:35:33.12,00:35:33.12,">> They are cute, aren't they? Watching these guys working"
557,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,"together, I'm ecstatic. Coming back into Survivor, I"
558,00:35:41.50,00:35:41.50,know the first five days are the hardest time.
559,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,"I haven't hit that wall yet. Maybe in our tribe, we won't."
560,00:35:50.83,00:35:50.83,"I mean, shoot, we found chickens?"
561,00:35:53.04,00:35:53.04,We're going to be out of the elements.
562,00:35:56.25,00:35:56.25,It's good to be a Hero. >> What'd you guys think of
563,00:36:09.71,00:36:09.71,the challenge today? >> Let's review-- we're glad
564,00:36:12.21,00:36:12.21,that Rupert stubbed his toe. >> Aargh!
565,00:36:15.58,00:36:15.58,"(laughter) >> The thing is, like, one part"
566,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,"of me, like, wants to have sympathy for him, but another"
567,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,"side of me, I almost relished the fact that they got injured."
568,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"I was like, ""Good for them."" (laughter)"
569,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,>> I definitely had mixed emotions about losing the
570,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,"challenge, because whereas personally it made a statement,"
571,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,the tribe lost. I had him the whole time.
572,00:36:36.38,00:36:36.38,There was not one point in that challenge where I thought he
573,00:36:38.92,00:36:38.92,was gonna get the better of me. >> You were very relaxed.
574,00:36:40.96,00:36:40.96,"I saw it in your face. >> Well, there was this sec"
575,00:36:42.58,00:36:42.58,that he almost took off running and you had to tackle him down.
576,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,">> Yeah. >> We were like, ""No!"""
577,00:36:47.71,00:36:47.71,>> Everybody thought that Colby was gonna have his way with me.
578,00:36:50.54,00:36:50.54,"The tribe was taking about it long after I'd forgotten it,"
579,00:36:53.21,00:36:53.21,about how I'd gone out there and basically frog-marched Colby
580,00:36:56.71,00:36:56.71,"to, uh, to the mat at the end. So it was very fulfilling."
581,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,"And at the very end, dude, I was, like, kind of, like, moved"
582,00:37:01.79,00:37:01.79,"him, moved him, moved him, mat. >> Bam."
583,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,(laughter) >> It was... I enjoyed every
584,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"second of that. Coach, what a surprise."
585,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,"Honestly, I'm-I'm very surprised by Coach."
586,00:37:14.33,00:37:14.33,"There's just something about him, and I don't know what it"
587,00:37:17.21,00:37:17.21,is yet. I'm definitely gonna make it a
588,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,point to get to know Coach. I know I'm stealing Coach's
589,00:37:23.12,00:37:23.12,"mantra here, but I'm going into this like a warrior."
590,00:37:25.46,00:37:25.46,'Cause that's really what you have to do.
591,00:37:27.54,00:37:27.54,>> How did you know that was my mantra?
592,00:37:30.38,00:37:30.38,">> Uh, I heard stuff about you. >> Yeah, okay."
593,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,One thing that appeals to me about Jerri is that she's a
594,00:37:36.08,00:37:36.08,"different kind of girl, and, uh, that interests me, because I'm"
595,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"a different kind of guy. >> Randy, I hear you chuckling"
596,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"over there. >> (laughing): No, I'm laughing"
597,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"at Colby's face. Actually, he looked a little"
598,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,scared. ...you don't step away from
599,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,love. If it's hitting you in the
600,00:38:11.04,00:38:11.04,"face, you grab ahold to it. You never know, man."
601,00:38:13.58,00:38:13.58,>> You never know. >> You never know.
602,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,>> I would never get in the way of true love.
603,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,">> Go for it, dude. Go for it. >> I agree."
604,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,>> Are you talking about Parvati?
605,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,(laughter) >> I have never in a million
606,00:38:27.38,00:38:27.38,years would think about coming out on Survivor and actually
607,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"being interested in somebody. But Jerri and I, we have a"
608,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,"little connection. >> How's it going, Coach?"
609,00:38:36.42,00:38:36.42,I'm keeping my eye on him. >> Are you guys playing Cupid?
610,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,>> Yes. You and the dragon slayer.
611,00:38:44.79,00:38:44.79,"(laughing) >> Ooh, I see romance blooming"
612,00:38:47.29,00:38:47.29,"between Jerri and Coach. And Jerri's in total denial,"
613,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"but she totally flirts, and she's, I think, in spite of"
614,00:38:54.21,00:38:54.21,"herself, a little bit in love with the dragon slayer."
615,00:38:59.54,00:38:59.54,>> I'm setting you up with Coach.
616,00:39:01.38,00:39:01.38,What's the problem? You know what?
617,00:39:03.29,00:39:03.29,"Love finds you sometimes, and you don't even know it."
618,00:39:06.25,00:39:06.25,">> Well, you do know that just by cuddling together one night,"
619,00:39:10.21,00:39:10.21,we created a whole little... >> I know.
620,00:39:12.62,00:39:12.62,>> ...controversial buzz that could potentially not be...
621,00:39:16.54,00:39:16.54,"I don't know. >> Well, I just think we carry"
622,00:39:18.33,00:39:18.33,"on our business. I mean, I think that if we just"
623,00:39:20.50,00:39:20.50,"go about our day and we don't have too many talks like this,"
624,00:39:22.46,00:39:22.46,unless we're walking down the beach that way.
625,00:39:24.12,00:39:24.12,">> I know, right? >> But it sucks, because, you"
626,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,"know, obviously, I want to talk to you."
627,00:39:29.12,00:39:29.12,">> I know, I know. >> The girls were joking about"
628,00:39:31.21,00:39:31.21,"it. They were, like, ""Oh, the black"
629,00:39:33.25,00:39:33.25,"widow and the dragon slayer-- what a combination."""
630,00:39:35.08,00:39:35.08,"Hey, you never know, we might pair up and run this game."
631,00:39:38.21,00:39:38.21,"But we need to be careful, Jerri and I, of having the"
632,00:39:41.00,00:39:41.00,appearance of being in an unbreakable alliance.
633,00:39:43.42,00:39:43.42,">> Will you promise me if I should worry about something,"
634,00:39:45.79,00:39:45.79,"let me know? >> Well, don't worry about"
635,00:39:47.75,00:39:47.75,anything. Okay?
636,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,">> Okay. Yeah, 'cause the last... I hate feeling alone"
637,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,out here. >> Don't... You're not alone.
638,00:39:53.29,00:39:53.29,>> It's the worst feeling in the world.
639,00:39:55.04,00:39:55.04,">> No, you shouldn't be worried. You're with the dragon slayer,"
640,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,man-- don't you worry about that.
641,00:40:14.75,00:40:14.75,>> We got a good group. >> That's what I'm saying.
642,00:40:17.12,00:40:17.12,">> Here's the thing, this is between me and you right here,"
643,00:40:19.17,00:40:19.17,it's got to be. But I'm willing to make an
644,00:40:21.08,00:40:21.08,alliance right now with you. 'Cause I haven't made an
645,00:40:23.08,00:40:23.08,"alliance with nobody, brother. >> Yeah."
646,00:40:25.75,00:40:25.75,>> I don't want the physical threat of being thrown out of
647,00:40:27.92,00:40:27.92,"here. We should never lose, man."
648,00:40:29.50,00:40:29.50,>> Yeah. >> I don't want flower power to
649,00:40:31.25,00:40:31.25,"be running over this thing like it was, you know."
650,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,">> Hey, I went through it, so... >> I know, man."
651,00:40:35.04,00:40:35.04,">> It was terrible. >> James and I, you know, we're"
652,00:40:37.29,00:40:37.29,buddies right off the bat. We both work hard.
653,00:40:39.96,00:40:39.96,"He's a guy's guy. I mean, we can talk straight up."
654,00:40:42.50,00:40:42.50,"Anything he tells me, I believe it."
655,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,Could I ever beat James if it was me and him in the final two?
656,00:40:47.08,00:40:47.08,No. But... I don't see me and him in the final two.
657,00:40:50.79,00:40:50.79,"I'd rather see us rock on through and stay strong, dude."
658,00:40:53.54,00:40:53.54,">> Yeah, let's keep the guys together."
659,00:40:55.88,00:40:55.88,">> If we go to... That's... hey, that's the deal."
660,00:40:58.08,00:40:58.08,">> No, for real. >> I'm gonna form alliances"
661,00:41:00.42,00:41:00.42,with everyone I can. My strategy is to keep everyone
662,00:41:03.00,00:41:03.00,"on my side, man. >> Here's the thing, Candice..."
663,00:41:10.25,00:41:10.25,...for J.T. and James. >> I know that James and Amanda
664,00:41:14.38,00:41:14.38,"played together. >> I don't know them, but I"
665,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,"know that there's people that, you know..."
666,00:41:26.42,00:41:26.42,>> Yeah. That's my concern. >> The first couple of days are
667,00:41:30.17,00:41:30.17,always the worst out here. Because you don't have
668,00:41:33.21,00:41:33.21,"everything settled, you don't know everybody, and so it's"
669,00:41:36.75,00:41:36.75,always kind of awkward. >> What do you know about Cirie?
670,00:41:41.04,00:41:41.04,">> You mean, like, how she played the game?"
671,00:41:43.04,00:41:43.04,>> I don't know anything about her.
672,00:41:44.75,00:41:44.75,>> I don't know her. >> Yeah.
673,00:41:50.12,00:41:50.12,">> Are they friends? >> Going into the game again,"
674,00:41:54.29,00:41:54.29,"I'm worried about people who have a history together,"
675,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,they've played on seasons before together.
676,00:42:00.50,00:42:00.50,And I don't really have anyone that I have a solid history
677,00:42:04.42,00:42:04.42,"with going into the game. >> Well, didn't take long for"
678,00:42:08.83,00:42:08.83,the game to start. >> (laughs): Yeah.
679,00:42:10.88,00:42:10.88,>> We're back again. >> I know.
680,00:42:12.88,00:42:12.88,What do you think? >> I don't know yet.
681,00:42:14.88,00:42:14.88,"What do you think? >> I don't know, I'm trying"
682,00:42:16.88,00:42:16.88,to... >> Trying to assess the
683,00:42:18.83,00:42:18.83,situation. >> Yeah. (laughs)
684,00:42:21.25,00:42:21.25,Exactly. We can't be off alone like
685,00:42:23.62,00:42:23.62,"this, though. >> James, myself, and Cirie,"
686,00:42:30.54,00:42:30.54,"you know, we've played this game together before."
687,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,I've played this twice with James-- in China and Micronesia.
688,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,"I've played it once with Cirie, and Cirie and I went to the end"
689,00:42:38.08,00:42:38.08,together. We were in an alliance the
690,00:42:40.46,00:42:40.46,"whole time, so we're going to have to watch our distance,"
691,00:42:43.00,00:42:43.00,"because if people think we're too chummy, it could... it could"
692,00:42:46.75,00:42:46.75,"definitely play against us. >> So, how you doing, my friend?"
693,00:42:49.62,00:42:49.62,Welcome to Samoa. (laughing) >> Thank God we're on the same
694,00:42:53.08,00:42:53.08,tribe. >> It's good to be here with you
695,00:42:54.92,00:42:54.92,"again-- yeah, that's great! It's like d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu, right?"
696,00:42:59.46,00:42:59.46,"So, um, hopefully, we can just run this thing where we avoid"
697,00:43:02.67,00:43:02.67,"Tribal Council in the beginning. >> Yeah, but I'm trying to"
698,00:43:06.54,00:43:06.54,think who... who do you want to get involved with here.
699,00:43:10.38,00:43:10.38,>> Right. My closest ally is Stephenie.
700,00:43:13.96,00:43:13.96,We played well together in our season in Palau.
701,00:43:18.21,00:43:18.21,"And, uh, I was thrilled to see her back here on this beach in"
702,00:43:21.25,00:43:21.25,"my tribe. I think Colby... Colby, J.T."
703,00:43:25.08,00:43:25.08,"and you would be my choice, but like you said, we don't know"
704,00:43:27.83,00:43:27.83,what they're thinking is... >> That's what I was thinking.
705,00:43:30.04,00:43:30.04,">> I'm gonna try to work with Stephenie as far as we can, but"
706,00:43:33.58,00:43:33.58,she might not be my smartest end player.
707,00:43:37.50,00:43:37.50,If I were to get that far in the game and were to face a
708,00:43:41.12,00:43:41.12,"jury, I want somebody else who won the million dollars to sit"
709,00:43:44.12,00:43:44.12,"next to me. So, you know, seeing you right"
710,00:43:46.33,00:43:46.33,"away, I will... you know, you want to make some kind of an"
711,00:43:49.12,00:43:49.12,"oath, whatever. You and I need each other in the"
712,00:43:51.83,00:43:51.83,"finals, because we both won the money."
713,00:43:54.12,00:43:54.12,>> They have to choose one of us.
714,00:43:56.00,00:43:56.00,">> If either one of us, no matter how good a game we play,"
715,00:43:58.38,00:43:58.38,goes up against someone who didn't win...
716,00:44:00.21,00:44:00.21,">> We lose. Me and you, man."
717,00:44:01.96,00:44:01.96,>> It's a good plan. >> People are expecting me to be
718,00:44:05.46,00:44:05.46,"that guy they saw on Tocantins, you know, that guy who stuck by"
719,00:44:08.04,00:44:08.04,his word and done everything he had to do.
720,00:44:11.46,00:44:11.46,"But this game is completely different, because everyone's"
721,00:44:13.58,00:44:13.58,already seen me play. >> You're my guy for the end.
722,00:44:16.62,00:44:16.62,">> All right, you got me. >> Right."
723,00:44:19.00,00:44:19.00,">> You know, I need you... and you need me."
724,00:44:21.42,00:44:21.42,">> We need each other. >> To win this game of Survivor,"
725,00:44:24.00,00:44:24.00,you have to have a dark side somewhere.
726,00:44:26.08,00:44:26.08,You have to be willing to sacrifice some of your
727,00:44:29.17,00:44:29.17,integrity to make it far in this game.
728,00:44:31.92,00:44:31.92,And I'm not looking to save my hero name.
729,00:44:34.83,00:44:34.83,I'm here to do what I have to do to win this game.
730,00:44:37.62,00:44:37.62,So it's going to be a whole different ballgame for me.
731,00:44:41.79,00:44:41.79,"(sighs) >> Sandra, do you know how to"
732,00:44:53.50,00:44:53.50,do this? (laughter)
733,00:44:55.92,00:44:55.92,>> This is not working. I think I'm not going to do
734,00:44:58.58,00:44:58.58,this anymore. >> We got ten people here.
735,00:45:03.83,00:45:03.83,"They don't want to do anything for more than, like, ten minutes"
736,00:45:06.71,00:45:06.71,at a time. >> I know.
737,00:45:08.71,00:45:08.71,">> But nobody has any energy, because we don't have any water."
738,00:45:11.08,00:45:11.08,>> Everybody's going to be dead for this challenge if we don't
739,00:45:13.79,00:45:13.79,get water. >> Yeah.
740,00:45:15.79,00:45:15.79,>> We have to build a fire. It's been six years since I've
741,00:45:18.71,00:45:18.71,"played the game, and a lot has changed."
742,00:45:22.04,00:45:22.04,"Like, there's nobody here that wants to do anything."
743,00:45:26.08,00:45:26.08,They don't want to build a shelter.
744,00:45:28.29,00:45:28.29,They don't want to try to get a fire going.
745,00:45:30.67,00:45:30.67,It's not that they don't know what to do-- they've all played
746,00:45:33.12,00:45:33.12,Survivor before. Sandra's won the game.
747,00:45:36.12,00:45:36.12,So they know what they're doing.
748,00:45:38.83,00:45:38.83,"And it's, like, ripping at my every fiber. Ugh!"
749,00:45:43.25,00:45:43.25,"My wife told me, have patience. Amber, I'm trying."
750,00:45:48.92,00:45:48.92,>> You're-you're just gonna carve a gouge in there and...
751,00:45:51.21,00:45:51.21,>> A little gouge. Then I'm going to take another
752,00:45:53.79,00:45:53.79,piece of bamboo and rub it like this.
753,00:45:56.17,00:45:56.17,">> You know, nobody's going to get voted out for not making"
754,00:45:58.58,00:45:58.58,"fire, and nobody's going to get to stay..."
755,00:46:01.04,00:46:01.04,>> If they do. >> ...trying to make fire.
756,00:46:03.83,00:46:03.83,So why don't we blow it off? >> Do you think? (laughs)
757,00:46:07.21,00:46:07.21,You're just going to wear yourself out.
758,00:46:13.38,00:46:13.38,">> You know, I played this game before, and if you don't have"
759,00:46:16.29,00:46:16.29,"flint and steel, you can't make fire."
760,00:46:19.50,00:46:19.50,Not by rubbing two sticks together.
761,00:46:21.71,00:46:21.71,This game lasts 39 days. I think we'll get fire by the
762,00:46:24.29,00:46:24.29,"end of 39 days. >> Now, slow, short strokes at"
763,00:46:29.00,00:46:29.00,"first. A little faster, guys."
764,00:46:43.17,00:46:43.17,>> Starting to get some smoke. >> Yeah!
765,00:46:45.46,00:46:45.46,">> Oh, my God! >> Keep going."
766,00:46:47.92,00:46:47.92,"All right, real fast now. >> Here we go!"
767,00:46:51.25,00:46:51.25,"(loud grunting) >> Three, two, one."
768,00:46:56.25,00:46:56.25,Do it. >> Flames.
769,00:47:12.08,00:47:12.08,>> It's happening. >> This is happening.
770,00:47:14.21,00:47:14.21,">> Rob, you're the man down here, too."
771,00:47:16.21,00:47:16.21,None of us are gonna do anything.
772,00:47:18.21,00:47:18.21,You're in charge. >> Here we go.
773,00:47:25.96,00:47:25.96,>> Here we go. (excited shouts)
774,00:47:29.12,00:47:29.12,">> Oh, yeah! Unbelievable!"
775,00:47:32.21,00:47:32.21,>> I'm still the same guy I was the first time I played this
776,00:47:36.04,00:47:36.04,"game-- that competitiveness, that cutthroat-ness, that's me."
777,00:47:40.38,00:47:40.38,"At the same time, a lot has happened with me personally in"
778,00:47:43.92,00:47:43.92,my life in the six years since I've played this game last.
779,00:47:47.04,00:47:47.04,"You know, I got married, I had a kid, I'm learning compromise"
780,00:47:50.00,00:47:50.00,"and patience. But look at these people, you"
781,00:47:52.46,00:47:52.46,"know? Not the brightest bulbs, and"
782,00:47:54.54,00:47:54.54,"I'm here trying to make the most of it, trying to make it"
783,00:47:57.17,00:47:57.17,work. >> We got fire!
784,00:47:59.67,00:47:59.67,(excited shouts) >> Look at it!
785,00:48:02.04,00:48:02.04,>> Wow! >> Beautiful!
786,00:48:04.21,00:48:04.21,>> Amazing! >> I wouldn't have believed it
787,00:48:06.54,00:48:06.54,"if I didn't see it. >> (laughs): I know, man."
788,00:48:09.67,00:48:09.67,">> Now, I got to tell you, I'm a little in awe of Rob, and I'm"
789,00:48:12.75,00:48:12.75,"not like that with people. You know, he's played it twice."
790,00:48:15.08,00:48:15.08,He's intuitive and ingenious and very smart.
791,00:48:17.71,00:48:17.71,"So that's great. I mean, he's a great guy to"
792,00:48:20.00,00:48:20.00,have on the tribe. You are the man.
793,00:48:22.00,00:48:22.00,"And it's, like, when you're talking, I'm just, like..."
794,00:48:24.08,00:48:24.08,"I'm, like, literally hanging on every word."
795,00:48:26.46,00:48:26.46,">> I appreciate it, I do. >> I'm serious."
796,00:48:28.17,00:48:28.17,"I'm, like, hanging on every word."
797,00:48:30.21,00:48:30.21,">> We made fire, and now Coach is going off with Boston"
798,00:48:32.75,00:48:32.75,Rob like he's a hero or something.
799,00:48:36.17,00:48:36.17,">> I'm bromancing on my idol, what can I say?"
800,00:48:38.25,00:48:38.25,">> Rob, he thinks he's the boss of the camp."
801,00:48:41.00,00:48:41.00,"He thinks he's in control. But this is my mountain, and I'm"
802,00:48:44.46,00:48:44.46,still the king of the hill. Survivor is my palace.
803,00:48:49.00,00:48:49.00,"So I'm still the king, unless I'm dethroned."
804,00:48:52.00,00:48:52.00,And you know what? That ain't gonna happen.
805,00:48:57.25,00:48:57.25,>> PROBST: Coming up on this special two-hour season
806,00:49:00.25,00:49:00.25,premiere of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains:
807,00:49:03.21,00:49:03.21,>> We have to divide them. >> PROBST: Survivors ready?
808,00:49:05.62,00:49:05.62,"Go! >> Come on, Heroes!"
809,00:49:09.17,00:49:09.17,">> PROBST: Coach leading the tribe of Villains, using all of"
810,00:49:12.12,00:49:12.12,that life experience in a kayak. >> It's only a matter of time
811,00:49:17.04,00:49:17.04,before that tribe self-destructs.
812,00:49:21.54,00:49:21.54,>> It's time to cut his throat. >> Being able to get out in the
813,00:49:39.17,00:49:39.17,"ocean, that's where I feel most comfortable."
814,00:49:42.46,00:49:42.46,But my toe is broken at least two places.
815,00:49:45.50,00:49:45.50,And I haven't caught a darn fish yet.
816,00:49:48.21,00:49:48.21,"I think it'd be better off for me right now, especially"
817,00:49:52.00,00:49:52.00,"with my darn toe, to be a worker bee."
818,00:49:55.17,00:49:55.17,I'm going to start us a fire. You can do this.
819,00:49:59.83,00:49:59.83,Just start the damn fire. (whispers): Gosh darn it.
820,00:50:09.88,00:50:09.88,Come on. Come on. Come on.
821,00:50:14.08,00:50:14.08,"Come on, you can do this. >> Rupert the fire maker."
822,00:50:18.75,00:50:18.75,"(laughing): He shaved half the magnesium off the flint, you"
823,00:50:23.25,00:50:23.25,"know, and still couldn't get the fire."
824,00:50:27.04,00:50:27.04,"You don't want to say anything. You just sit there and watch,"
825,00:50:29.25,00:50:29.25,because his ego is so humongous. What can you say?
826,00:50:38.04,00:50:38.04,">> Yeah, I'll tell you why I can't, Rupe."
827,00:50:40.08,00:50:40.08,">> You want to go ahead, but, uh, I've been sitting here"
828,00:50:43.88,00:50:43.88,"for a while, and... we've had some hellacious piles of"
829,00:50:47.75,00:50:47.75,magnesium. God!
830,00:50:50.92,00:50:50.92,It's okay. It's a state of mind.
831,00:50:53.25,00:50:53.25,Making fire is as much a state of mind as anything.
832,00:50:59.67,00:50:59.67,"(birds chirping) >> Wow, that's looking..."
833,00:51:14.17,00:51:14.17,Now we're talking. >> Yay.
834,00:51:17.88,00:51:17.88,The only thing that I'm worried about is my darn broken toe.
835,00:51:22.08,00:51:22.08,If it starts coming up more and more about how much pain I'm
836,00:51:25.25,00:51:25.25,really in and what I really can bring to this tribe-- because I
837,00:51:29.50,00:51:29.50,haven't done a whole lot yet-- that worries me.
838,00:51:33.21,00:51:33.21,Wow. Good for you guys. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
839,00:51:44.38,00:51:44.38,>> You just scoot up. Tyson and I decided we wanted
840,00:51:49.83,00:51:49.83,to try to climb this coconut tree to get the palm fronds off.
841,00:51:54.88,00:51:54.88,Think it's a little too dangerous?
842,00:51:56.38,00:51:56.38,>> It's pretty precarious... with the wind.
843,00:51:59.04,00:51:59.04,>> The wind is blowing up there now.
844,00:52:04.08,00:52:04.08,">> Get down. >> She's, like, ""Why'd you"
845,00:52:06.12,00:52:06.12,"let him do that?"" If he breaks his leg."
846,00:52:07.92,00:52:07.92,">> He's a father. >> Yeah, I was told not to do"
847,00:52:10.08,00:52:10.08,anything stupid. You go ahead and try.
848,00:52:12.04,00:52:12.04,"I could probably get up there and get them, but why would I"
849,00:52:15.08,00:52:15.08,"risk falling and getting hurt? Man, it's higher than it looks."
850,00:52:18.21,00:52:18.21,"But I know somebody that, you know, is so full of themself,"
851,00:52:20.96,00:52:20.96,"when you give them a challenge, they're just going to have to"
852,00:52:23.42,00:52:23.42,"do it because they're the greatest and the best, and"
853,00:52:25.88,00:52:25.88,"you know, every day out here they get stronger."
854,00:52:31.58,00:52:31.58,">> He wants to be a Hero, but he's really a Villain, so we'll"
855,00:52:34.67,00:52:34.67,see how this goes. >> I say don't do it.
856,00:52:38.17,00:52:38.17,">> Get your ass up that tree, will ya?"
857,00:52:40.46,00:52:40.46,">> Boston Rob and I do have a good time together, you know?"
858,00:52:42.88,00:52:42.88,"I like talking to him, because he's really-- he's sharp, and I"
859,00:52:45.17,00:52:45.17,"like that, and he's gonna challenge me, and I think I'm"
860,00:52:47.38,00:52:47.38,gonna challenge him. I think I need somebody that's
861,00:52:49.88,00:52:49.88,"able to sharpen me, as iron sharpens iron."
862,00:52:53.25,00:52:53.25,">> Come on, you can do it. >> Oh, at least he'll land in"
863,00:52:56.12,00:52:56.12,the water. >> You want to make a bet?
864,00:52:58.21,00:52:58.21,>> What? >> If he makes it or not?
865,00:53:00.04,00:53:00.04,I'll bet you a dollar. >> The person that I think I'm
866,00:53:03.42,00:53:03.42,"most like is Boston Rob. Seeing Rob here, it reminds me"
867,00:53:06.83,00:53:06.83,of when he played the first time-- I loved him.
868,00:53:10.25,00:53:10.25,Okay. >> All right?
869,00:53:11.42,00:53:11.42,">> All right, a dollar. A dollar that he won't make it"
870,00:53:14.12,00:53:14.12,"to the top, and you're saying a dollar that he'll do it?"
871,00:53:16.33,00:53:16.33,>> He's going to do it. >> That's someone I could see
872,00:53:18.54,00:53:18.54,myself aligning with until it's time to cut his throat.
873,00:53:28.25,00:53:28.25,>> I bet on you! >> What?
874,00:53:30.25,00:53:30.25,>> I bet that you would make it. >> I bet that you'd fall in the
875,00:53:33.50,00:53:33.50,"water. >> Oh, he's giving up!"
876,00:53:38.67,00:53:38.67,"Oh, no, he's giving up! >> You're not a warrior!"
877,00:53:41.92,00:53:41.92,"Get up there! >> Get back down, get back down."
878,00:53:45.83,00:53:45.83,">> Man! >> Right to Sandra, winner,"
879,00:53:49.00,00:53:49.00,from... from Boston Bob the loser.
880,00:53:53.75,00:53:53.75,">> Boston Bob. >> So I bowed out, swallowed my"
881,00:53:57.54,00:53:57.54,pride. It's not worth it.
882,00:54:00.04,00:54:00.04,"Tucked my tail, went back down. >> Man, you cost me."
883,00:54:02.71,00:54:02.71,>> I won. >> I made a bet and I lost.
884,00:54:05.25,00:54:05.25,>> I could have probably made it up to that where it starts
885,00:54:07.42,00:54:07.42,"getting steep. >> Coulda, shoulda, woulda,"
886,00:54:09.42,00:54:09.42,didn't. >> But it's not worth it.
887,00:54:11.25,00:54:11.25,"Could I make it up there? Yes. But if I fall off, I mean, why"
888,00:54:14.25,00:54:14.25,risk that? >> From the Hero to the zero.
889,00:54:17.21,00:54:17.21,>> From the Hero to the zero? >> Yep.
890,00:54:19.42,00:54:19.42,>> He was a Hero... >> From the Villain to the never
891,00:54:22.50,00:54:22.50,was. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
892,00:54:43.71,00:54:43.71,">> This game, it's a reflection of your life, and you don't even"
893,00:54:47.46,00:54:47.46,realize it. I guess in life I always need a
894,00:54:49.96,00:54:49.96,"protector of some sort, and especially in the game of"
895,00:54:53.17,00:54:53.17,Survivor. So now I'm starting to realize
896,00:54:55.92,00:54:55.92,that I've got these sexy young men on my tribe.
897,00:55:03.38,00:55:03.38,"What's going on over there, Colby?"
898,00:55:08.75,00:55:08.75,>> It was night two. People are starting to fade off
899,00:55:11.79,00:55:11.79,and get some much-needed rest. That's what we have to have to
900,00:55:14.54,00:55:14.54,stay strong and compete. >> Is that a satellite or a
901,00:55:17.29,00:55:17.29,"shooting star? >> And Sugar, she just starts"
902,00:55:19.21,00:55:19.21,"chatting up again, and not whispering but chatting up loud."
903,00:55:22.38,00:55:22.38,">> You guys are all spooning. I don't want to spoon, I want"
904,00:55:26.12,00:55:26.12,to... (laughs) >> And then you could start to
905,00:55:28.46,00:55:28.46,feel and see everyone kind of wrestle awake.
906,00:55:31.42,00:55:31.42,I couldn't even roll over without her rolling over and
907,00:55:33.92,00:55:33.92,"putting her arms around me, or then when I would just lay"
908,00:55:36.29,00:55:36.29,"there still like I was in a coffin, she'd grab my hands and"
909,00:55:39.25,00:55:39.25,"put them on her. I'm being flirted with, and I'm"
910,00:55:42.04,00:55:42.04,just not interested. >> Should we go back to
911,00:55:44.46,00:55:44.46,that corner? Let's go.
912,00:55:47.83,00:55:47.83,Go in the corner where we were. >> She chased me all around the
913,00:55:58.29,00:55:58.29,"shelter. Wherever I'd go, two seconds"
914,00:56:01.21,00:56:01.21,"later, she'd show up there. She's becoming a bit annoying."
915,00:56:05.96,00:56:05.96,Nobody really had a good night's sleep because of her.
916,00:56:09.46,00:56:09.46,If you ruffle the feathers of the tribe... (whistles) they'll
917,00:56:14.08,00:56:14.08,get rid of you in a hurry. >> Has everybody talked about
918,00:56:27.04,00:56:27.04,"what they want to eat tonight? We gotta have boiled eggs,"
919,00:56:30.00,00:56:30.00,don't you think? >> Chicken.
920,00:56:31.75,00:56:31.75,>> You want a chicken? >> First challenge?
921,00:56:34.67,00:56:34.67,">> No, heck, yeah. >> And he's the biggest, too,"
922,00:56:37.29,00:56:37.29,so... >> Yep.
923,00:56:42.75,00:56:42.75,">> We're thinking of maybe cooking a rooster, depending on"
924,00:56:44.83,00:56:44.83,how much fish we get. >> There are some parallels in
925,00:56:47.17,00:56:47.17,how you decide which chicken to eat in the same way you devour
926,00:56:50.04,00:56:50.04,your enemies in the game of Survivor.
927,00:56:52.21,00:56:52.21,"If they're producing eggs, they'll probably stay around"
928,00:56:54.38,00:56:54.38,"camp for a long time. If they're not, they're going"

1118,01:06:34.21,01:06:34.21,>> PROBST: It's in. Everybody to the top.
1119,01:06:36.25,01:06:36.25,">> Go, go, go! >> PROBST: It started as"
1120,01:06:38.96,01:06:38.96,blowout for the Heroes. It is ending as a blowout for
1121,01:06:42.96,01:06:42.96,"the Villains. >> Light it up, light it up,"
1122,01:06:45.21,01:06:45.21,light it up! >> PROBST: Villains win first
1123,01:06:47.12,01:06:47.12,"immunity challenge! >> Yeah, baby!"
1124,01:06:50.04,01:06:50.04,"Good job, good job! >> Man!"
1125,01:06:58.67,01:06:58.67,">> PROBST: Villains, congratulations."
1126,01:07:02.29,01:07:02.29,Immunity keeps you safe from Tribal Council.
1127,01:07:06.33,01:07:06.33,Fire will hopefully get your camp in order.
1128,01:07:08.79,01:07:08.79,>> Yes! >> Yeah!
1129,01:07:10.04,01:07:10.04,">> Yes! >> PROBST: Sugar, three days"
1130,01:07:13.12,01:07:13.12,"into this game, right on cue, you're crying."
1131,01:07:16.79,01:07:16.79,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, Heroes."
1132,01:07:21.29,01:07:21.29,Tribal Council tonight. One of the ten of you will be
1133,01:07:23.88,01:07:23.88,the first person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs.
1134,01:07:27.46,01:07:27.46,Villains. Grab your stuff.
1135,01:07:29.04,01:07:29.04,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
1136,01:07:31.17,01:07:31.17,"Villains, congratulations. Grab your stuff."
1137,01:07:33.08,01:07:33.08,Head back to camp. >> Thank you.
1138,01:07:34.88,01:07:34.88,>> If Sugar's having some sort of emotional breakdown on day
1139,01:07:37.96,01:07:37.96,"three, she's not fit to be out here another 36 days."
1140,01:07:41.83,01:07:41.83,"Losing her, we're going to miss..."
1141,01:07:45.83,01:07:45.83,"Yeah, I don't think we're going to miss much."
1142,01:08:03.38,01:08:03.38,">> Yeah, how do you like us now, huh?"
1143,01:08:07.04,01:08:07.04,>> Yeah! >> All right!
1144,01:08:09.67,01:08:09.67,>> Good job. >> Good work.
1145,01:08:13.88,01:08:13.88,">> Now, we have a relaxing afternoon."
1146,01:08:16.08,01:08:16.08,Nobody has to go cut anybody's throat.
1147,01:08:18.79,01:08:18.79,"We just have a nice nice, huh? >> It was exciting to win the"
1148,01:08:24.17,01:08:24.17,immunity challenge. We had to do it because we
1149,01:08:27.04,01:08:27.04,didn't want one of our people to be the first to leave
1150,01:08:31.04,01:08:31.04,Heroes vs. Villains. Now we're trying to figure out
1151,01:08:35.04,01:08:35.04,who they're going to send home and why.
1152,01:08:38.00,01:08:38.00,">> Well, Tom and Stephenie are together."
1153,01:08:41.08,01:08:41.08,They were together from before. James has to be with Cirie and
1154,01:08:46.12,01:08:46.12,Amanda and what's the other one? When push comes to shove and
1155,01:08:52.12,01:08:52.12,"nobody wants to go home first, it's about who all you've been"
1156,01:08:54.46,01:08:54.46,with and who you know. >> Yeah.
1157,01:08:57.17,01:08:57.17,>> What I like about it is they all shook up now.
1158,01:08:59.21,01:08:59.21,Now they are divided. We have to divide them.
1159,01:09:03.71,01:09:03.71,The Heroes got their asses handed to them.
1160,01:09:07.88,01:09:07.88,"And, you know what, we were having a good time just sitting"
1161,01:09:10.17,01:09:10.17,"back loving it. Oh, I'm happy!"
1162,01:09:13.21,01:09:13.21,">> Keep going, keep going. >> It strengthens our tribe and"
1163,01:09:16.46,01:09:16.46,it weakens the Heroes' tribe. >> We looked like a team a
1164,01:09:20.62,01:09:20.62,"little bit today. Like eight out of ten, 80%..."
1165,01:09:26.00,01:09:26.00,>> A solid B-plus. >> They got to stab somebody
1166,01:09:29.17,01:09:29.17,in the back. They're over there being
1167,01:09:31.88,01:09:31.88,villains. That's what they're doing.
1168,01:09:43.21,01:09:43.21,>> This is not good. Nobody in a million years would
1169,01:09:47.08,01:09:47.08,have guessed we are going to Tribal Council on day three.
1170,01:09:50.67,01:09:50.67,"Hopefully, this loss does nothing to our momentum other"
1171,01:09:55.17,01:09:55.17,than show us that we're vulnerable.
1172,01:09:59.12,01:09:59.12,They might be a little more sneaky and a little more game
1173,01:10:01.38,01:10:01.38,"playey and a little more damn puzzle oriented, and that's"
1174,01:10:05.08,01:10:05.08,"fine. >> Well, they wanted it pretty"
1175,01:10:07.17,01:10:07.17,bad. >> They needed it.
1176,01:10:09.17,01:10:09.17,>> Yeah. >> And we were a little cocky.
1177,01:10:12.50,01:10:12.50,We walked in there like the heroes.
1178,01:10:14.58,01:10:14.58,"You know, there's big ""S's"" on all of our chests."
1179,01:10:20.62,01:10:20.62,This Heroes vs. Villains is going to be a tough one.
1180,01:10:26.25,01:10:26.25,"When we thought we had it in the bag, they showed us we"
1181,01:10:30.17,01:10:30.17,don't. >> You guys want some coconuts?
1182,01:10:40.12,01:10:40.12,>> Neither was I. >> What do you think?
1183,01:10:45.75,01:10:45.75,>> Amanda? >> Okay.
1184,01:10:48.12,01:10:48.12,">> Okay, we all...? Well, that's fine with me."
1185,01:10:50.46,01:10:50.46,As long as it's not me. >> It's freaking awesome with
1186,01:10:53.25,01:10:53.25,me. Please. >> Okay.
1187,01:10:55.08,01:10:55.08,">> When we lost, I felt really, really awful."
1188,01:10:57.96,01:10:57.96,"I helped us lose, I guess, because I was on the puzzle,"
1189,01:11:00.29,01:11:00.29,and I felt bad because we had such a good lead before.
1190,01:11:03.21,01:11:03.21,I just was disappointed in myself.
1191,01:11:06.96,01:11:06.96,And scared. I don't want to talk to anyone.
1192,01:11:11.08,01:11:11.08,">> Me, either. >> I'm so depressed right now."
1193,01:11:14.12,01:11:14.12,"(laughing) These are all people, some of"
1194,01:11:18.62,01:11:18.62,"them have all played together before, and they're really good."
1195,01:11:22.25,01:11:22.25,"And I think that Amanda and James are together, so we have"
1196,01:11:25.25,01:11:25.25,"to break that up, if at all possible."
1197,01:11:36.71,01:11:36.71,>> This isn't a bad thing. >> No.
1198,01:11:38.75,01:11:38.75,>> I think Sugar. I think everyone's thinking
1199,01:11:40.75,01:11:40.75,Sugar. >> Yeah.
1200,01:11:56.58,01:11:56.58,>> Is that done? >> Yeah.
1201,01:11:58.46,01:11:58.46,>> Yeah? >> Yeah.
1202,01:12:00.25,01:12:00.25,>> What are you thinking? >> I'm thinking that you have a
1203,01:12:03.04,01:12:03.04,follower and you got one of the smartest strategic players
1204,01:12:06.50,01:12:06.50,in the game. Why are we taking out the
1205,01:12:08.54,01:12:08.54,follower instead of the strategic player?
1206,01:12:10.71,01:12:10.71,"Cirie... >> Oh, Cirie?"
1207,01:12:12.33,01:12:12.33,>> ...has run this game a few times. So...
1208,01:12:15.92,01:12:15.92,"I really believe that when you identify a threat, you take them"
1209,01:12:18.92,01:12:18.92,out as soon as possible. You don't wait.
1210,01:12:21.96,01:12:21.96,"People did that on my season, and they waited too long, and"
1211,01:12:24.38,01:12:24.38,then they didn't get the opportunity to get rid of me.
1212,01:12:26.75,01:12:26.75,So I don't want to have those regrets that those people had.
1213,01:12:30.17,01:12:30.17,>> I have no problem. >> Just a thought.
1214,01:12:32.96,01:12:32.96,Just a thought. >> I'm down with that.
1215,01:12:35.00,01:12:35.00,>> Cirie is just a brilliant strategist in the game.
1216,01:12:38.12,01:12:38.12,"She's proven that, so I'm just a little nervous to give her a"
1217,01:12:41.25,01:12:41.25,bye tonight. >> So I told you three my
1218,01:12:53.58,01:12:53.58,concerns about Cirie. >> Cirie-- I worry about her the
1219,01:12:56.46,01:12:56.46,most. >> Right.
1220,01:12:58.38,01:12:58.38,">> Cirie's tricky. >> So, who are we voting for?"
1221,01:13:05.17,01:13:05.17,That's what I'm... >> I like Sugar...
1222,01:13:07.33,01:13:07.33,>> They're voting for Sugar? >> Who's voting for Sugar?
1223,01:13:09.67,01:13:09.67,>> The other group. >> Do we need to break up Tom
1224,01:13:12.38,01:13:12.38,and Stephenie? >> I agree.
1225,01:13:14.75,01:13:14.75,Because why waste a vote? And you're not going to be able
1226,01:13:17.75,01:13:17.75,"to get him later. So, what are we doing? Tom?"
1227,01:13:19.83,01:13:19.83,>> Tom or Stephenie. I'm good with either one.
1228,01:13:21.71,01:13:21.71,">> You got to make a decision which one before we go back,"
1229,01:13:23.88,01:13:23.88,'cause we're not going to be able to talk again.
1230,01:13:27.46,01:13:27.46,">> Word on the street is, Sugar is supposed to go tonight."
1231,01:13:30.12,01:13:30.12,"Why Sugar? Sugar, yes, she's annoying,"
1232,01:13:32.25,01:13:32.25,"which is even a better reason for me to keep her around,"
1233,01:13:36.12,01:13:36.12,because as long as there's somebody annoying and
1234,01:13:38.08,01:13:38.08,"somebody... less strong than I am, then that takes the target"
1235,01:13:42.04,01:13:42.04,off of me. So if we could get one of the
1236,01:13:46.83,01:13:46.83,"stronger players out, like Tom or Stephenie, that would be"
1237,01:13:49.83,01:13:49.83,better for me. So I'd rather not have Sugar go
1238,01:13:51.88,01:13:51.88,"tonight. My concern is, if we don't"
1239,01:13:57.17,01:13:57.17,"knock one of them out, like Stephenie, who ca..."
1240,01:14:00.12,01:14:00.12,We're going to lose challenges without Stephenie?
1241,01:14:02.17,01:14:02.17,>> Maybe. She's a really strong swimmer.
1242,01:14:05.17,01:14:05.17,>> And can't-- and Sugar is not? >> I don't think so.
1243,01:14:08.21,01:14:08.21,>> I don't know. I'm just... you know...
1244,01:14:12.08,01:14:12.08,>> There is an advantage of keeping Stephenie right now and
1245,01:14:15.12,01:14:15.12,"getting rid of Sugar, physically, like, for the"
1246,01:14:17.17,01:14:17.17,"challenges. But strategically, Stephenie"
1247,01:14:20.17,01:14:20.17,has got game and she has to go. You think Stephenie?
1248,01:14:23.21,01:14:23.21,>> The smartest... the smartest move right now would be
1249,01:14:25.96,01:14:25.96,"Stephenie. I mean, think about it."
1250,01:14:28.08,01:14:28.08,"We want to make moves that's gonna guarantee us, you know,"
1251,01:14:31.54,01:14:31.54,"getting further in this game. >> It's so hard, because you"
1252,01:14:36.21,01:14:36.21,"want to keep your team strong, but strategically, you have to"
1253,01:14:38.75,01:14:38.75,put yourself in a good position. Either you're doing it for
1254,01:14:41.46,01:14:41.46,"challenges, or you're going to get rid of someone for"
1255,01:14:43.38,01:14:43.38,strategic reasons. Or you just don't like them.
1256,01:14:47.62,01:14:47.62,"Cirie and I are here for blood, okay?"
1257,01:14:50.67,01:14:50.67,We are here to win this thing. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1258,01:15:18.12,01:15:18.12,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
1259,01:15:39.92,01:15:39.92,a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch.
1260,01:15:41.83,01:15:41.83,"Approach a flame, dip it in, and get fire."
1261,01:15:50.25,01:15:50.25,"This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because in this"
1262,01:15:53.79,01:15:53.79,"game, as you know, fire represents your life."
1263,01:15:57.67,01:15:57.67,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
1264,01:16:00.21,01:16:00.21,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
1265,01:16:02.29,01:16:02.29,That will be the case for one of you tonight.
1266,01:16:07.08,01:16:07.08,"First, let me just welcome you to Tribal."
1267,01:16:10.12,01:16:10.12,"We're 40 feet in the air in the middle of the jungle, no roof."
1268,01:16:13.67,01:16:13.67,"If it rains, we will get wet. As I'm sure will happen once or"
1269,01:16:17.79,01:16:17.79,twice out here. I just want to look at some of
1270,01:16:20.79,01:16:20.79,the reasons you might vote somebody off.
1271,01:16:23.38,01:16:23.38,"Tom, how big a factor do you think prior relationships-- you"
1272,01:16:27.83,01:16:27.83,"and Stephenie, Amanda and Cirie, people that have played"
1273,01:16:31.54,01:16:31.54,together before that others might look at and think: they've
1274,01:16:33.88,01:16:33.88,"got to be friends, they got to be in an alliance, they know"
1275,01:16:36.08,01:16:36.08,each other? >> I think that we all worried
1276,01:16:38.46,01:16:38.46,about that coming into it. I think it's kind of been
1277,01:16:40.79,01:16:40.79,pushed to the side now. We realize that you just got
1278,01:16:43.12,01:16:43.12,to give everybody a clean slate and take it from there.
1279,01:16:45.83,01:16:45.83,"So, I'm not too worried about the previous relationships."
1280,01:16:48.88,01:16:48.88,">> PROBST: Sugar, you haven't played with anybody."
1281,01:16:51.29,01:16:51.29,"Do you buy what Tom's saying? Is it fine, it's a clean slate?"
1282,01:16:54.33,01:16:54.33,"""I don't really care if they knew somebody else before."""
1283,01:16:56.92,01:16:56.92,">> Well, I thought that was a really good speech, but I do"
1284,01:17:00.04,01:17:00.04,think that that is definitely a factor-- people who have played
1285,01:17:03.79,01:17:03.79,together and people who knew each other and people who hang
1286,01:17:05.75,01:17:05.75,"out, or whatever. >> PROBST: What about past"
1287,01:17:08.08,01:17:08.08,"success? Amanda, you've played twice,"
1288,01:17:11.17,01:17:11.17,and you've made it to the end both times.
1289,01:17:13.71,01:17:13.71,Do you find yourself already trying to deflect some of the
1290,01:17:16.42,01:17:16.42,"attention that might be on you? >> You know, one thing that I"
1291,01:17:20.33,01:17:20.33,did do in both my seasons to get to the end was make loyal
1292,01:17:23.04,01:17:23.04,alliances. So I think in a way it's a
1293,01:17:25.71,01:17:25.71,"positive thing for me. And, yeah, I haven't won."
1294,01:17:28.38,01:17:28.38,"Like, obviously, we all know, I'm not good at Tribal Council."
1295,01:17:30.75,01:17:30.75,">> Yeah, that was the best Tribal Council question you've"
1296,01:17:33.04,01:17:33.04,ever answered. >> See? I'm working on it.
1297,01:17:35.04,01:17:35.04,>> You answered that really correctly.
1298,01:17:36.33,01:17:36.33,I'm surprised. I'd say it out loud.
1299,01:17:38.17,01:17:38.17,">> Shut up, James. >> That was the best."
1300,01:17:40.29,01:17:40.29,>> PROBST: You're surprised and I'm excited.
1301,01:17:42.42,01:17:42.42,">> Obviously. >> It took me a while, but I'm"
1302,01:17:44.25,01:17:44.25,"getting the hang of it. So, yeah, it's both."
1303,01:17:46.96,01:17:46.96,"I mean, there's people in this game that have won."
1304,01:17:48.92,01:17:48.92,"I mean, come on, you know. >> PROBST: Cirie, you're the"
1305,01:17:52.67,01:17:52.67,woman that stayed at home and watched Survivor on the couch.
1306,01:17:56.25,01:17:56.25,And now here you are for the third time-- yet another reason
1307,01:18:00.38,01:18:00.38,to get rid of somebody. She's grown into a bona fide
1308,01:18:04.00,01:18:04.00,"threat to win the game. How do you defend that, first"
1309,01:18:07.08,01:18:07.08,"Tribal Council? >> Well, like you said, Jeff,"
1310,01:18:10.96,01:18:10.96,"everybody here is a threat. If they weren't threatening,"
1311,01:18:14.08,01:18:14.08,"they wouldn't be here. >> PROBST: Steph, that's really"
1312,01:18:16.62,01:18:16.62,"what we're getting at, at this first Tribal Council."
1313,01:18:19.25,01:18:19.25,Is there's a reason to get rid of every single person up here.
1314,01:18:23.04,01:18:23.04,">> Well, I think, as far as trying to make a decision"
1315,01:18:26.00,01:18:26.00,"tonight, it's the first one, and that's the hardest, I think."
1316,01:18:29.17,01:18:29.17,But we don't want to come back here.
1317,01:18:31.79,01:18:31.79,"I mean, what I'm doing is I'm going to go with who I think is"
1318,01:18:34.21,01:18:34.21,the weakest for the team right now.
1319,01:18:37.21,01:18:37.21,And will help us stay the strongest we can to continue to
1320,01:18:39.83,01:18:39.83,win. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
1321,01:18:42.08,01:18:42.08,"today's challenge. James, first half of the"
1322,01:18:44.50,01:18:44.50,"challenge, you guys smoked them by a long ways."
1323,01:18:48.12,01:18:48.12,"Then we got to the puzzle. Amanda, Sugar, Cirie, Rupert--"
1324,01:18:53.42,01:18:53.42,disaster. >> It's sucked because nobody
1325,01:18:56.04,01:18:56.04,was focusing. Everybody had their own opinion.
1326,01:18:58.96,01:18:58.96,It was like everybody wanted to solve the puzzle differently.
1327,01:19:02.04,01:19:02.04,"But hopefully, they'll focus next time because this just"
1328,01:19:04.75,01:19:04.75,"can't happen no more. >> PROBST: Cirie, if it's you"
1329,01:19:07.54,01:19:07.54,"tonight, is it fair to take it because you were one of the"
1330,01:19:12.12,01:19:12.12,people that blew it on the puzzle?
1331,01:19:14.42,01:19:14.42,>> I don't think one challenge should determine your worth in
1332,01:19:18.54,01:19:18.54,the long run of this game. It could have been Tom and
1333,01:19:23.08,01:19:23.08,"Stephenie, and they could have lost the puzzle."
1334,01:19:26.12,01:19:26.12,">> PROBST: Sugar, you were one of the four people that blew it"
1335,01:19:28.83,01:19:28.83,on the puzzle. >> I know.
1336,01:19:31.12,01:19:31.12,>> PROBST: There's no debate about that.
1337,01:19:32.92,01:19:32.92,"Would it be fair to say ""Voting Sugar out""?"
1338,01:19:35.17,01:19:35.17,">> Well, that's why I was crying."
1339,01:19:37.88,01:19:37.88,>> PROBST: Because you're afraid that might be the reason?
1340,01:19:40.08,01:19:40.08,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Would that be
1341,01:19:41.92,01:19:41.92,criteria enough for you to get rid of somebody?
1342,01:19:43.46,01:19:43.46,">> No, not me. I wouldn't vote somebody out"
1343,01:19:47.17,01:19:47.17,just because they were part of a team that didn't win the
1344,01:19:49.71,01:19:49.71,"challenge. >> PROBST: Candice, you got to"
1345,01:19:52.50,01:19:52.50,vote somebody out. Does it make it easier for you
1346,01:19:54.92,01:19:54.92,"to say ""Well, I could just simply blame it on the puzzle""?"
1347,01:19:57.29,01:19:57.29,>> I think the people who stepped up to do the puzzle
1348,01:20:00.21,01:20:00.21,"were pretty brave, so I think we should appreciate that they"
1349,01:20:03.00,01:20:03.00,stepped up to do that and not start voting people out for
1350,01:20:06.42,01:20:06.42,that because otherwise nobody is ever going to do a puzzle.
1351,01:20:08.38,01:20:08.38,">> PROBST: Tom, do you vote tonight based on long-term game"
1352,01:20:12.79,01:20:12.79,or short-term game? >> I think that people are
1353,01:20:15.75,01:20:15.75,"developing their relationships, and kind of everyone is always"
1354,01:20:18.75,01:20:18.75,"looking towards the endgame, but that's not what we're"
1355,01:20:21.46,01:20:21.46,working on now. We're working on staying strong
1356,01:20:24.88,01:20:24.88,"with your best people, and let's not come back here"
1357,01:20:27.58,01:20:27.58,anymore and we don't have to worry about who we're voting
1358,01:20:29.62,01:20:29.62,"out. >> PROBST: Candice, a lot of"
1359,01:20:31.71,01:20:31.71,these people know each other. Is the first Tribal Council
1360,01:20:34.21,01:20:34.21,maybe an opportunity to take one person out of the equation
1361,01:20:37.17,01:20:37.17,and really change things up? >> I think the first Tribal
1362,01:20:40.21,01:20:40.21,Council is an opportunity to do anything.
1363,01:20:42.75,01:20:42.75,"We've got ten people here, and there's a lot of different"
1364,01:20:45.67,01:20:45.67,"ideas going around. So, yes..."
1365,01:20:50.17,01:20:50.17,Or no. (laughter)
1366,01:20:53.71,01:20:53.71,">> PROBST: All right, well,  clearly there's a legitimate"
1367,01:20:57.04,01:20:57.04,reason to vote every single person out.
1368,01:21:00.21,01:21:00.21,The only thing left to do is find out who that person is
1369,01:21:02.25,01:21:02.25,going to be. It is time to vote.
1370,01:21:04.38,01:21:04.38,"Candice, you're up. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
1371,01:21:48.79,01:21:48.79,(thunder rumbling) >> PROBST: I'll go tally
1372,01:22:06.12,01:22:06.12,"the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
1373,01:22:21.83,01:22:21.83,decision is final. The person voted out will be
1374,01:22:24.04,01:22:24.04,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
1375,01:22:26.17,01:22:26.17,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Sugar."
1376,01:22:35.54,01:22:35.54,Sugar. Two votes Sugar.
1377,01:22:41.12,01:22:41.12,Sugar. That's three votes Sugar.
1378,01:22:47.58,01:22:47.58,Sugar. That's four votes Sugar.
1379,01:22:53.46,01:22:53.46,"Amanda. Four votes Sugar, one vote"
1380,01:22:57.17,01:22:57.17,"Amanda. That's five votes Sugar, one"
1381,01:23:04.12,01:23:04.12,vote Amanda. First person voted out of
1382,01:23:09.17,01:23:09.17,Survivor: Heroes vs.  Villains-- Sugar.
1383,01:23:12.29,01:23:12.29,>> Okay. One of you all better win.
1384,01:23:22.17,01:23:22.17,">> PROBST: Sugar, the tribe has spoken."
1385,01:23:26.88,01:23:26.88,Time for you to go. >> Bye.
1386,01:23:42.79,01:23:42.79,">> PROBST: All right, first person voted out of this game,"
1387,01:23:45.04,01:23:45.04,a Hero. After you get back to camp and
1388,01:23:47.21,01:23:47.21,"get your fire going, should be one thing on your mind--"
1389,01:23:50.08,01:23:50.08,getting even. Grab your torches.
1390,01:23:52.46,01:23:52.46,Head back to camp. Try to stay dry.
1391,01:24:06.67,01:24:06.67,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
1392,01:24:14.21,01:24:14.21,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
1393,01:24:23.29,01:24:23.29,>> Rob? Rob.
1394,01:24:26.38,01:24:26.38,Uh-oh. >> Can open your eyes for us?
1395,01:24:32.00,01:24:32.00,">> PROBST: Rob, can you hear me? >> It's not a great feeling to"
1396,01:24:39.50,01:24:39.50,be the first person voted off. I was crying today because I'm
1397,01:24:42.33,01:24:42.33,dramatic and I felt like I lost the game for everybody.
1398,01:24:46.25,01:24:46.25,And I think they did probably make the right decision in
1399,01:24:49.12,01:24:49.12,"voting me out because I am I'd say the weakest link, although"
1400,01:24:52.96,01:24:52.96,I give it my all. But I can't wait to get some
1401,01:24:55.67,01:24:55.67,clothes on.
