11,00:00:26.80,00:00:26.80,- You guys were gone.
12,00:00:28.10,00:00:28.10,- It don't matter-- we're all making it--
13,00:00:29.17,00:00:29.17,you can't make the decisions!
14,00:00:30.30,00:00:30.30,"- Tommy, Tommy."
15,00:00:31.73,00:00:31.73,I had to open it for her.

22,00:00:50.37,00:00:50.37,- Whoo!
23,00:00:51.40,00:00:51.40,"- Tonight, in a special episode,"
24,00:00:53.97,00:00:53.97,"through highlights and never-before-seen footage,"
25,00:00:56.80,00:00:56.80,we'll take a closer look
26,00:00:58.17,00:00:58.17,at the adventure that has gotten them to this point.
27,00:01:00.93,00:01:00.93,- Clarence and his war paint
28,00:01:02.23,00:01:02.23,is just a testament to his selfishness.
29,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73,He's the tribe's warrior.
30,00:01:06.43,00:01:06.43,What?
31,00:01:07.77,00:01:07.77,- Frank has deer antlers.
32,00:01:10.10,00:01:10.10,He goes over to the Samburu sign and...
33,00:01:13.97,00:01:13.97,freaks out with them.
34,00:01:15.43,00:01:15.43,- Are you gay? - Uh-huh.
35,00:01:17.03,00:01:17.03,"- First thing I had to do was just ask him straight up,"
36,00:01:19.33,00:01:19.33,get the burden out.
37,00:01:20.70,00:01:20.70,"- Forward, march."
38,00:01:22.07,00:01:22.07,"- Left, right, left, right."
39,00:01:24.07,00:01:24.07,"Left, right. Soccer players, too."
40,00:01:26.43,00:01:26.43,(chanting and singing)

44,00:02:35.67,00:02:35.67,"scorching desert of Eastern Africa,"
45,00:02:37.87,00:02:37.87,where water is scarce and the dangers are real.
46,00:02:40.83,00:02:40.83,"- Down, down, faster! Hurry up, hurry up!"
47,00:02:43.47,00:02:43.47,"Faster, faster, faster! Down!"
48,00:02:45.37,00:02:45.37,Have a nice day. Bye-bye.
49,00:02:48.40,00:02:48.40,"- As two separate tribes, Samburu and Boran,"
50,00:02:50.93,00:02:50.93,they gathered whatever supplies they could carry
51,00:02:53.77,00:02:53.77,and set out for the abandoned manyata dwellings
52,00:02:56.17,00:02:56.17,that would be their homes for the next 39 days.
53,00:03:00.20,00:03:00.20,"- Frank is like a big strong ex-army guy,"
54,00:03:03.60,00:03:03.60,"and when we were hiking,"
55,00:03:04.87,00:03:04.87,"he was like a block away from us,"
56,00:03:07.43,00:03:07.43,"just trooping on all by himself and he would,"
57,00:03:09.83,00:03:09.83,"like, stop and wait for us,"
58,00:03:11.60,00:03:11.60,and you could tell he was really put out.
59,00:03:13.07,00:03:13.07,"- Number one thing killing us right now is daylight, okay?"
60,00:03:17.07,00:03:17.07,"If you're not alive,"
61,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10,"you don't have to worry about drinking,"
62,00:03:19.20,00:03:19.20,"eating or doing anything, okay?"
63,00:03:20.70,00:03:20.70,This is my proposed plan.
64,00:03:22.37,00:03:22.37,Let's discuss it.
65,00:03:23.87,00:03:23.87,You drop everything but the essentials of water
66,00:03:26.17,00:03:26.17,and our backpacks--
67,00:03:27.47,00:03:27.47,leave the manmade objects other than the food.
68,00:03:29.63,00:03:29.63,It's not too much farther--
69,00:03:31.50,00:03:31.50,let's get there-- let's get some security around us--
70,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57,there's always tomorrow.
71,00:03:34.70,00:03:34.70,"- Frank, let's do it."
72,00:03:36.07,00:03:36.07,"- All right, guys, you want to grab it?"
73,00:03:37.27,00:03:37.27,- Just grab it and go--
74,00:03:38.63,00:03:38.63,we're taking way too long trying to figure it all out.
75,00:03:46.23,00:03:46.23,"- Pick it up, pick it up."
76,00:03:47.73,00:03:47.73,- I think I see the sign.
77,00:03:50.50,00:03:50.50,"Yes, right there."
78,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,- Good job!
79,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,"- Oh, my God, that rocks!"
80,00:03:57.93,00:03:57.93,- Whoo!
81,00:04:00.33,00:04:00.33,"- Upon their arrival,"
82,00:04:01.83,00:04:01.83,both tribes found that water would be a serious issue.
83,00:04:05.57,00:04:05.57,- It's so sick.
84,00:04:08.03,00:04:08.03,The water is disgusting.
85,00:04:09.63,00:04:09.63,"It's this deep, so that all-- you get water mixed with crud."
86,00:04:17.93,00:04:17.93,"- All right, let me explain to you."
87,00:04:19.23,00:04:19.23,- Okay.
88,00:04:20.57,00:04:20.57,"- That is the spring, see, underneath the ground."
89,00:04:22.07,00:04:22.07,- Yeah.
90,00:04:23.20,00:04:23.20,"- Okay, that is our water source."
91,00:04:24.20,00:04:24.20,- Okay.
92,00:04:25.60,00:04:25.60,- I'm going to move that thing and clean that spring out.
93,00:04:28.87,00:04:28.87,"- Going to get there to watch,"
94,00:04:30.30,00:04:30.30,make sure no animals come down and get us
95,00:04:32.30,00:04:32.30,because there's dangerous animals here.
96,00:04:35.33,00:04:35.33,You just got to keep clapping
97,00:04:36.93,00:04:36.93,and hope they don't come down here.
98,00:04:41.23,00:04:41.23,(clapping)
99,00:04:48.47,00:04:48.47,- Let's hurry up--
100,00:04:49.60,00:04:49.60,I thought I heard something like a lion.
101,00:04:52.77,00:04:52.77,- For real? - For real.
102,00:04:54.73,00:04:54.73,I'm serious.
103,00:04:56.47,00:04:56.47,- Diane was worried she heard a lion.
104,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,I was shoveling the spring out--
105,00:05:01.90,00:05:01.90,"you know, it was the most important thing we had to do."
106,00:05:04.73,00:05:04.73,We have to have water.
107,00:05:06.83,00:05:06.83,But she heard a lion and we had to go.
108,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,"- Come on, let's get going!"
109,00:05:10.93,00:05:10.93,"Let's go, let's go."
110,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63,I'm serious. Right up over there.
111,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,- I didn't see or hear your tig-- your lion.
112,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77,"- Well, I-- I-- I-- I heard it."
113,00:05:20.10,00:05:20.10,- We got to realize that this spring
114,00:05:21.63,00:05:21.63,is the most important thing we got.
115,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60,"- I know-- I understand, I know."
116,00:05:25.13,00:05:25.13,"I know we don't see him, but, you know,"
117,00:05:27.23,00:05:27.23,they could be just laying there.
118,00:05:29.50,00:05:29.50,- I think-- I think-- I think
119,00:05:30.87,00:05:30.87,you're on high instinct right now.
120,00:05:32.77,00:05:32.77,"- Hey, we got to go, we got to go."
121,00:05:35.07,00:05:35.07,"I'm getting bit up by mosquitoes,"
122,00:05:37.67,00:05:37.67,and I hope none of them have malaria.
123,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,- You're just having jungle paranoia.
124,00:05:43.43,00:05:43.43,"- Lions, mosquitoes, aliens--"
125,00:05:44.93,00:05:44.93,it's all coming at you right now.
126,00:05:46.90,00:05:46.90,"- Diane is a crybaby, titty sucker. She's weak."
127,00:05:50.27,00:05:50.27,I knew that coming in to the game.
128,00:05:52.40,00:05:52.40,I knew she'd be weak.
129,00:05:55.30,00:05:55.30,"- For Boran and Samburu,"
130,00:05:57.20,00:05:57.20,gathering the water was only half the battle.
131,00:05:59.60,00:05:59.60,- Anybody knows that you don't just belly up
132,00:06:01.70,00:06:01.70,"to the stream that you're camping next to,"
133,00:06:03.43,00:06:03.43,drop your canteen in it and drink the water.
134,00:06:05.63,00:06:05.63,"If you don't boil your water out here,"
135,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,"you end up with dysentery, which basically"
136,00:06:09.63,00:06:09.63,has you puking and crapping your guts out.
137,00:06:13.23,00:06:13.23,"- With no fire to boil the water,"
138,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,both tribes spent the first night thirsty
139,00:06:18.37,00:06:18.37,and in the dark.
140,00:06:21.87,00:06:21.87,"- What happened, what broke?"
141,00:06:23.03,00:06:23.03,- The rope broke.
142,00:06:23.87,00:06:23.87,- Oh.
143,00:06:26.77,00:06:26.77,"- On day two, Boran continued to struggle with fire."
144,00:06:30.13,00:06:30.13,"But Samburu had success, thanks to a lens from a telescope."
145,00:06:33.90,00:06:33.90,"- I unscrewed the telescope, pulled out the lens,"
146,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,"and I was like, Silas,"
147,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,isn't there something we can do with this?
148,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,"Oh, my God."
149,00:06:42.33,00:06:42.33,"You guys, come here-- we got fire!"
150,00:06:44.07,00:06:44.07,"- Quick, quick."
151,00:06:45.33,00:06:45.33,"- Hey, that thing right there!"
152,00:06:47.77,00:06:47.77,- Put the hay on it. Put the hay on it.
153,00:06:50.43,00:06:50.43,(cheering)
154,00:06:56.73,00:06:56.73,- The first immunity challenge
155,00:06:58.47,00:06:58.47,proved to be more difficult than anyone expected.
156,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,Go!
157,00:07:05.60,00:07:05.60,(shouting)
158,00:07:09.97,00:07:09.97,It was especially hard on Diane from Boran.
159,00:07:12.90,00:07:12.90,"- Stay awake, look at me."
160,00:07:13.80,00:07:13.80,Look in my eyes.
161,00:07:16.03,00:07:16.03,- Samburu won immunity.
162,00:07:20.23,00:07:20.23,"On day three, as Tribal Council loomed for Boran,"
163,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,Clarence made a political blunder.
164,00:07:26.33,00:07:26.33,He opened a can of beans to share with Diane
165,00:07:28.53,00:07:28.53,while the others were away.
166,00:07:30.20,00:07:30.20,- It's no big deal.
167,00:07:31.73,00:07:31.73,- It's a big deal to me.
168,00:07:32.97,00:07:32.97,"- It's a big deal to me, too."
169,00:07:33.90,00:07:33.90,- It was a judgment call I made.
170,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,- It was bad damn judgment.
171,00:07:36.30,00:07:36.30,- Today's a hard day for us.
172,00:07:37.57,00:07:37.57,We have to kick one of us out.
173,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,Today was not a good day to do this.
174,00:07:41.53,00:07:41.53,"- But at the first Tribal Council,"
175,00:07:44.13,00:07:44.13,it was Diane who paid the price
176,00:07:46.03,00:07:46.03,for faltering at the challenge.
177,00:07:47.67,00:07:47.67,She was the first person voted out of the tribe.
178,00:07:56.30,00:07:56.30,- Can you imagine if you had a girl here that spent time
179,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97,looking in the mirror putting on makeup?
180,00:08:01.40,00:08:01.40,"I mean, you just... - That's true."
181,00:08:03.10,00:08:03.10,- It's just unbelievable.
182,00:08:04.40,00:08:04.40,- She'd be so the first one voted off.
183,00:08:14.97,00:08:14.97,- The war paint is...
184,00:08:16.60,00:08:16.60,it was my luxury item-- it's something that puts me
185,00:08:19.30,00:08:19.30,in that frame of mind for what I have to do
186,00:08:21.70,00:08:21.70,"for this tribe, which is be a warrior,"
187,00:08:24.60,00:08:24.60,be an instrument of our decisions.
188,00:08:29.60,00:08:29.60,- Clarence and his war paint is just a testament
189,00:08:32.77,00:08:32.77,"to his selfishness, and that doesn't fly out here."
190,00:08:35.60,00:08:35.60,He's the tribe's warrior.
191,00:08:37.43,00:08:37.43,What?
192,00:08:39.23,00:08:39.23,"No, no, you're not."
193,00:08:42.23,00:08:42.23,"- If I, like, started putting my socks in my boobs,"
194,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,"you know, wouldn't you guys think I was weird?"
195,00:08:47.27,00:08:47.27,"- Yeah, like it really mattered out here."
196,00:08:49.07,00:08:49.07,- Right.
197,00:08:51.83,00:08:51.83,"- He painted his abs, you know, with his makeup."
198,00:08:54.20,00:08:54.20,He put black in between his ab marks
199,00:08:56.63,00:08:56.63,to make 'em stand out.
200,00:08:57.60,00:08:57.60,I think that's stupid.
201,00:08:58.73,00:08:58.73,I think it's a little bit silly.
202,00:09:00.37,00:09:00.37,- It's obviously not cool
203,00:09:01.90,00:09:01.90,"to laugh at your fellow tribe members,"
204,00:09:04.83,00:09:04.83,but the makeup...
205,00:09:06.90,00:09:06.90,(laughs)
206,00:09:09.43,00:09:09.43,- He's always looking in the mirror.
207,00:09:11.13,00:09:11.13,He's so vain.
208,00:09:12.43,00:09:12.43,"I was in a sorority, and I've never seen any girl"
209,00:09:15.13,00:09:15.13,as vain as Clarence.
210,00:09:18.13,00:09:18.13,"Whatever, though-- who am I to talk?"
211,00:09:20.53,00:09:20.53,It's his luxury item.
212,00:09:21.93,00:09:21.93,Have fun-- paint yourself up like a little clown--
213,00:09:23.53,00:09:23.53,that's fine.
214,00:09:24.60,00:09:24.60,- Do you do that at home? - Huh?
215,00:09:26.23,00:09:26.23,- Do you do that at home?
216,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,- For paint balling.
217,00:09:28.23,00:09:28.23,I just got into paint balling
218,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,with some people that I met and...
219,00:09:30.87,00:09:30.87,- I guess I meant the war paint part of it.
220,00:09:33.07,00:09:33.07,I'm not sure I understand how that fits in with it.
221,00:09:35.37,00:09:35.37,- I got the paint on-- I just--
222,00:09:36.50,00:09:36.50,it's time to go to war.
223,00:09:37.60,00:09:37.60,Time to feel stronger.
224,00:09:40.13,00:09:40.13,"- I mean, look-- look at where we are."
225,00:09:43.07,00:09:43.07,It's just-- it doesn't get any more ridiculous than that.
226,00:09:46.37,00:09:46.37,"If nothing else, having Clarence around,"
227,00:09:49.70,00:09:49.70,"it's good, it's good for humor."
228,00:09:53.47,00:09:53.47,"- While Boran was dealing with questions of vanity,"
229,00:09:56.67,00:09:56.67,Samburu was dealing with questions of trust.
230,00:09:59.27,00:09:59.27,The older members approached Silas to join their alliance.
231,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30,- We want you on our side. - We're in a friggin' game.
232,00:10:05.37,00:10:05.37,"It's not a nice game at times. - No, I know what you mean."
233,00:10:07.80,00:10:07.80,- Nobody is gonna hate anybody. - I know.
234,00:10:09.53,00:10:09.53,"- It's a chess match. - It is, man, I know."
235,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,The strongest survive.
236,00:10:12.50,00:10:12.50,I know the-- I know the damn game.
237,00:10:14.60,00:10:14.60,Do you guys know Linda's for sure?
238,00:10:16.63,00:10:16.63,"- Linda's so concrete,"
239,00:10:17.97,00:10:17.97,she's buried in the bottom of the Hoover Dam.
240,00:10:19.93,00:10:19.93,- Lindsey was immediately suspicious.
241,00:10:22.50,00:10:22.50,- You better not get me voted out of here.
242,00:10:23.87,00:10:23.87,"- Trust me, we have got to knock the older people out."
243,00:10:26.50,00:10:26.50,- Are you telling this to everyone?
244,00:10:27.63,00:10:27.63,"No, I'm serious."
245,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,"- It's funny-- I mean, we're here"
246,00:10:30.30,00:10:30.30,to win a million dollars.
247,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80,So I'm going to do what it takes to win.
248,00:10:35.43,00:10:35.43,- Survivors ready.
249,00:10:37.27,00:10:37.27,Go!
250,00:10:38.30,00:10:38.30,"At the first reward challenge,"
251,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50,"the tribes were neck and neck,"
252,00:10:40.97,00:10:40.97,"until Kim, from Boran, took a fall."
253,00:10:44.50,00:10:44.50,Two feet at the top.
254,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,- Samburu won their second challenge in a row.
255,00:10:49.83,00:10:49.83,- Samburu!
256,00:10:51.87,00:10:51.87,"- Nice job, guys."
257,00:10:54.97,00:10:54.97,Day 5 found Jessie sick.
258,00:10:57.27,00:10:57.27,"Unable to drink the water, she was dehydrating quickly."
259,00:11:01.13,00:11:01.13,- Do you have an appetite at all?
260,00:11:02.43,00:11:02.43,- No.
261,00:11:03.47,00:11:03.47,- The guys are being really good.
262,00:11:05.17,00:11:05.17,They said it's okay.
263,00:11:06.37,00:11:06.37,"I mean, I don't know at this point."
264,00:11:10.30,00:11:10.30,I don't know.
265,00:11:13.67,00:11:13.67,"- At Samburu,"
266,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,"with the second immunity challenge imminent,"
267,00:11:17.20,00:11:17.20,Frank decided to prepare in his own special way.
268,00:11:24.80,00:11:24.80,"- Before we head off to the immunity challenges,"
269,00:11:27.43,00:11:27.43,I make it a point to go over there
270,00:11:29.37,00:11:29.37,and I grab the set of deer antlers
271,00:11:30.93,00:11:30.93,"I brought as a luxury item,"
272,00:11:32.27,00:11:32.27,and I begin striking them together.
273,00:11:38.53,00:11:38.53,And it's like
274,00:11:39.80,00:11:39.80,two mature White Tail North American bucks fighting.
275,00:11:45.80,00:11:45.80,"- Frank has, I think they're deer antlers,"
276,00:11:48.20,00:11:48.20,"and he goes over to the-- our sign,"
277,00:11:52.13,00:11:52.13,our Samburu sign and... freaks out with them.
278,00:11:56.93,00:11:56.93,"- Oh, he's talking about the antennas--"
279,00:11:59.30,00:11:59.30,"the antlers, you know."
280,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,"- The antennas? - You know, the..."
281,00:12:02.13,00:12:02.13,- They fight before the... - Yeah.
282,00:12:04.40,00:12:04.40,- It's quite a scene. - It is something to see.
283,00:12:06.77,00:12:06.77,Frank has these deer antlers that were his luxury item
284,00:12:11.63,00:12:11.63,"that he brought here, as his luxury item."
285,00:12:15.83,00:12:15.83,"Such a redneck, and he, like, bangs them together"
286,00:12:20.10,00:12:20.10,like two...
287,00:12:22.00,00:12:22.00,"something fighting, you know,"
288,00:12:23.43,00:12:23.43,"like it's two horns clashing,"
289,00:12:25.03,00:12:25.03,like he's this big testosterone stud.
290,00:12:27.67,00:12:27.67,"- It's just that spirit, and I'm driven."
291,00:12:30.97,00:12:30.97,I want them to see that--
292,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,"you know, what is he doing,"
293,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,hitting them on the ground--
294,00:12:34.73,00:12:34.73,"is their paws on the ground and their bodies hitting,"
295,00:12:36.50,00:12:36.50,"you know, and smashing, and I want them to see"
296,00:12:38.30,00:12:38.30,and say Frank's getting in the mood--
297,00:12:39.80,00:12:39.80,"look at him, he's getting in the mood."
298,00:12:40.70,00:12:40.70,And they should be thinking
299,00:12:41.93,00:12:41.93,maybe we should be getting in the mood.
300,00:12:43.00,00:12:43.00,"Come on-- yes, we want to win."
301,00:12:44.77,00:12:44.77,"- Look at him, look at him."
302,00:12:45.90,00:12:45.90,Is he intense!
303,00:12:46.97,00:12:46.97,- What's he doing?
304,00:12:48.27,00:12:48.27,"- That's his deer horns, man."
305,00:12:49.50,00:12:49.50,That's when the deer fight for supremacy.
306,00:12:51.60,00:12:51.60,"Two deer get together, they buck heads."
307,00:12:56.50,00:12:56.50,- I heard Doc saying that--
308,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97,"that's like the two bucks ramming at each other,"
309,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"and who's more powerful,"
310,00:13:02.67,00:13:02.67,and that's Frank's way of expressing his enthusiasm
311,00:13:07.33,00:13:07.33,for the next challenge.
312,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,More power to him!
313,00:13:28.83,00:13:28.83,"- Look, look, look. - Oh, my God!"
314,00:13:30.80,00:13:30.80,"- That's the tree we went to yesterday, T."
315,00:13:32.93,00:13:32.93,- Yeah. - Look at them all!
316,00:13:34.73,00:13:34.73,- Look how many there are. - You're spooking them.
317,00:13:37.10,00:13:37.10,"- Awesome! - Oh, my God."
318,00:13:39.60,00:13:39.60,"- On day six, Teresa gave the Samburu tribe"
319,00:13:43.37,00:13:43.37,a little pep talk.
320,00:13:44.73,00:13:44.73,- We got to come together as a team.
321,00:13:46.60,00:13:46.60,We're too divided.
322,00:13:48.40,00:13:48.40,"I mean, the tension and the friction between all of us."
323,00:13:50.87,00:13:50.87,"- Oh, we're together!"
324,00:13:51.97,00:13:51.97,- That's not what I've been hearing.
325,00:13:53.33,00:13:53.33,I have very perceptive ears.
326,00:13:55.37,00:13:55.37,"- Well, what did we say?"
327,00:13:56.40,00:13:56.40,(overlapping chatter)
328,00:13:59.03,00:13:59.03,- I've heard rumors that I'm going first--
329,00:14:00.70,00:14:00.70,"Kim's going first, Lindsay's going first,"
330,00:14:02.37,00:14:02.37,Bradford's going first-- come on.
331,00:14:03.70,00:14:03.70,- Brandon.
332,00:14:04.93,00:14:04.93,"- Brandon, I'm sorry-- I said Bradford."
333,00:14:06.10,00:14:06.10,- Whatever. - I'm serious.
334,00:14:08.13,00:14:08.13,"Let's get it back, what we had."
335,00:14:10.30,00:14:10.30,We don't know what's going to happen
336,00:14:11.43,00:14:11.43,with any of us down the road.
337,00:14:13.03,00:14:13.03,"None of us know, but we know that we're gonna all--"
338,00:14:15.20,00:14:15.20,one by one-- be gone if we don't win these challenges.
339,00:14:17.37,00:14:17.37,"- I mean, guys, we're all competitors--"
340,00:14:18.77,00:14:18.77,that's why we're on the team.
341,00:14:20.03,00:14:20.03,We're going to win. - Every day we got to win.
342,00:14:25.90,00:14:25.90,- The note for the second immunity challenge
343,00:14:28.47,00:14:28.47,arrived on day six.
344,00:14:30.37,00:14:30.37,- It's a food one!
345,00:14:31.70,00:14:31.70,"- Oh, it's the gross food challenge."
346,00:14:33.43,00:14:33.43,- That's all right-- I like that.
347,00:14:34.57,00:14:34.57,- Bring it on.
348,00:14:35.60,00:14:35.60,- There's nothing I won't eat.
349,00:14:36.67,00:14:36.67,"You know, it could be beef brain,"
350,00:14:37.97,00:14:37.97,"goat testicles, whatever."
351,00:14:42.97,00:14:42.97,- But when it came to drinking pure cow blood
352,00:14:45.73,00:14:45.73,"in the tradition of the East African tribes,"
353,00:14:48.33,00:14:48.33,"Kelly lost to Linda in the tie-breaking round,"
354,00:14:51.57,00:14:51.57,giving Samburu their third straight victory.
355,00:14:54.37,00:14:54.37,Linda!
356,00:14:55.40,00:14:55.40,"(whooping, cheering)"
357,00:15:01.83,00:15:01.83,"So it was back to Tribal Council for Boran,"
358,00:15:05.30,00:15:05.30,"where Clarence, Kim, Jessie and Kelly"
359,00:15:08.07,00:15:08.07,were all feeling vulnerable.
360,00:15:09.90,00:15:09.90,But the final vote revealed that Jessie's illness
361,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27,had caught up with her.
362,00:15:13.60,00:15:13.60,She was the second person voted out of the tribe.
363,00:15:17.40,00:15:17.40,Boran couldn't seem to get a break.
364,00:15:20.50,00:15:20.50,"That night, lions stalked their camp."
365,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,(lions roaring loudly)
366,00:15:25.10,00:15:25.10,- Go away!
367,00:15:26.57,00:15:26.57,(cans rattling)
368,00:15:32.97,00:15:32.97,"- I mean, it was, it made my blood run cold."
369,00:15:35.37,00:15:35.37,"We went into this thing knowing, yeah,"
370,00:15:36.80,00:15:36.80,"it's going to be tough, it's going to be real,"
371,00:15:38.20,00:15:38.20,but I don't think any of us really considered
372,00:15:40.73,00:15:40.73,that it was going to be quite that real.
373,00:15:43.00,00:15:43.00,"- My mind said stay, but my feet said go."
374,00:15:46.53,00:15:46.53,"I mean, it's all I could do"
375,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,"to keep from just running somewhere,"
376,00:15:49.30,00:15:49.30,but there's nowhere to run.
377,00:15:53.30,00:15:53.30,- That was real.
378,00:15:54.33,00:15:54.33,- It's still real.
379,00:15:55.70,00:15:55.70,- This is probably going to happen every night.
380,00:16:00.63,00:16:00.63,- Survivors ready!
381,00:16:01.40,00:16:01.40,- Ready! - Go!
382,00:16:03.23,00:16:03.23,"At the reward challenge,"
383,00:16:04.60,00:16:04.60,Boran finally got the ball rolling.
384,00:16:09.13,00:16:09.13,They had their first taste of victory.
385,00:16:11.47,00:16:11.47,- Boran! - Boran!
386,00:16:15.23,00:16:15.23,- Along with it came 100 gallons of fresh water.
387,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,- Hooray! - Whoo!
388,00:16:23.97,00:16:23.97,"- On day eight, Silas ended all speculation"
389,00:16:26.87,00:16:26.87,about his loyalties
390,00:16:28.23,00:16:28.23,when he sided with the younger people of his tribe.
391,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,"- The younger people, I think we've realized"
392,00:16:32.73,00:16:32.73,"that if we don't stick together,"
393,00:16:34.80,00:16:34.80,we're going to lose this.
394,00:16:35.90,00:16:35.90,"They're going to pick us off,"
395,00:16:37.33,00:16:37.33,and I'm not going out that way.
396,00:16:39.63,00:16:39.63,- They're immature.
397,00:16:41.20,00:16:41.20,"They're trying to get under our skin, and it's working."
398,00:16:43.70,00:16:43.70,- The third immunity challenge
399,00:16:45.70,00:16:45.70,required the tribes to build a distress signal
400,00:16:48.30,00:16:48.30,to be seen from a plane passing overhead.
401,00:16:50.17,00:16:50.17,"- ""Muster all your resources and don't stop to gloat."
402,00:16:54.30,00:16:54.30,"Fail to get our attention, you'll be facing the vote."""
403,00:16:58.30,00:16:58.30,- Let's do our S.O.S. like we're doing-- accentuate it.
404,00:17:02.27,00:17:02.27,They're going to see that thing.
405,00:17:03.93,00:17:03.93,"- Frankly, the four of us would like to possibly see"
406,00:17:06.73,00:17:06.73,an older person have a little weak moment
407,00:17:08.63,00:17:08.63,"in a competition, so they can all open their eyes,"
408,00:17:11.13,00:17:11.13,"because they keep coming down,"
409,00:17:12.67,00:17:12.67,saying the weak people need to go.
410,00:17:13.93,00:17:13.93,Just stick with me and we'll weed the weak ones out.
411,00:17:17.40,00:17:17.40,"- At Boran, the plan was to show lots of color."
412,00:17:21.03,00:17:21.03,- I had brought some acrylic paints with me
413,00:17:22.93,00:17:22.93,as my luxury item.
414,00:17:24.43,00:17:24.43,- And a lot of skin.
415,00:17:26.13,00:17:26.13,- We got a black man with white tighties on.
416,00:17:28.60,00:17:28.60,We got a big fat man with a flag waving.
417,00:17:31.43,00:17:31.43,We got two little skinny men with flags running around.
418,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,Woman in her thong there.
419,00:17:36.87,00:17:36.87,"If that wouldn't stop a plane, I\\ want to talk to the pilot."
420,00:17:41.90,00:17:41.90,"- Back at Samburu, Lindsay dehydrated"
421,00:17:44.63,00:17:44.63,under the hot sun.
422,00:17:45.87,00:17:45.87,"- The next thing I know, I looked over"
423,00:17:47.13,00:17:47.13,"and she was sitting underneath the shade of a tree,"
424,00:17:48.60,00:17:48.60,and it's just not like her personality
425,00:17:49.90,00:17:49.90,to sit down before a challenge was over.
426,00:17:52.20,00:17:52.20,I sat with her for quite a while
427,00:17:53.87,00:17:53.87,"trying to get her to drink, but she kept spitting it up."
428,00:17:56.97,00:17:56.97,- One of the things that Lindsay likes to say
429,00:17:58.97,00:17:58.97,on a regular basis is how strong she is.
430,00:18:01.53,00:18:01.53,Guess she's not so strong.
431,00:18:04.83,00:18:04.83,"- When the plane passed over,"
432,00:18:07.60,00:18:07.60,it was Boran's distress signal
433,00:18:09.17,00:18:09.17,that best caught the attention
434,00:18:10.43,00:18:10.43,of the pilot and drop master.
435,00:18:14.50,00:18:14.50,They finally won immunity.
436,00:18:22.73,00:18:22.73,- Yeah!
437,00:18:26.30,00:18:26.30,"- At Samburu's first Tribal Council,"
438,00:18:28.87,00:18:28.87,the young-old split caused a deadlock tie
439,00:18:31.40,00:18:31.40,between Lindsey and Carl.
440,00:18:32.73,00:18:32.73,- We have a tie.
441,00:18:34.00,00:18:34.00,"With no previous votes between them,"
442,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70,a sudden death competition determined
443,00:18:38.73,00:18:38.73,that Carl was the first Samburu member
444,00:18:40.90,00:18:40.90,to be ousted.
445,00:18:41.93,00:18:41.93,Correct answer: true. Carl...
446,00:18:45.70,00:18:45.70,"- Thank you, God."
447,00:18:46.97,00:18:46.97,- You need to bring me your torch.
448,00:18:47.67,00:18:47.67,"- Sorry, guys."
449,00:18:48.73,00:18:48.73,"- With Carl gone, the young"
450,00:18:50.50,00:18:50.50,were now in control of Samburu.
451,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,It's time for you to go.
452,00:19:03.13,00:19:03.13,"That night, back at camp,"
453,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,Lindsey couldn't hide her frustration
454,00:19:07.03,00:19:07.03,with the four votes she had just received.
455,00:19:10.00,00:19:10.00,- Seriously pumped.
456,00:19:11.40,00:19:11.40,"Trust me, when I'm pumped,"
457,00:19:12.77,00:19:12.77,you don't want to (bleep) with me.
458,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,"By the time I got back to camp,"
459,00:19:15.43,00:19:15.43,"I felt really angry-- just like,"
460,00:19:17.53,00:19:17.53,"it all hit me-- just like, oh, my God,"
461,00:19:19.37,00:19:19.37,"they picked me, those bastards!"
462,00:19:22.03,00:19:22.03,"- The thing about Lindsey, of course, she handled it wrong."
463,00:19:24.87,00:19:24.87,We needed their support and we needed to be kind to them.
464,00:19:28.03,00:19:28.03,"But boy, she really just kind of flew off,"
465,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,"you know, the deep end."
466,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,"- On day ten, when tree mail arrived,"
467,00:19:35.20,00:19:35.20,Linda let off a little steam of her own.
468,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,- It's over.
469,00:19:38.60,00:19:38.60,We're coming together now-- it's over.
470,00:19:40.73,00:19:40.73,- Thank you!
471,00:19:43.00,00:19:43.00,I've been dying to be on this team!
472,00:19:45.23,00:19:45.23,Let me on the team!
473,00:19:47.30,00:19:47.30,- Linda really came unglued.
474,00:19:49.03,00:19:49.03,"She has two very, very different sides--"
475,00:19:51.97,00:19:51.97,"like this sweet, little New England mom,"
476,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,"and then there's this-- I don't know,"
477,00:19:57.43,00:19:57.43,"crazy woman side, too."
478,00:19:59.57,00:19:59.57,- I'm ready to be on the team!
479,00:20:01.50,00:20:01.50,"Ready to be on the team, honey."
480,00:20:02.97,00:20:02.97,Can I have a hug?
481,00:20:03.90,00:20:03.90,"See, you're even hesitating."
482,00:20:05.27,00:20:05.27,Give me a hug.
483,00:20:07.20,00:20:07.20,"You know, why can't you hug me?"
484,00:20:08.90,00:20:08.90,When I went to motion for a hug
485,00:20:11.27,00:20:11.27,"and she literally froze like this, and her eyes were just--"
486,00:20:13.97,00:20:13.97,"she like, panicked, like don't come near me,"
487,00:20:15.90,00:20:15.90,like she was frightened.
488,00:20:17.60,00:20:17.60,Did your mama never hug you?
489,00:20:19.57,00:20:19.57,There you go.
490,00:20:20.70,00:20:20.70,"I said oh, your mama didn't hug you?"
491,00:20:23.57,00:20:23.57,That was inappropriate.
492,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,"That was low-- that was wrong,"
493,00:20:26.13,00:20:26.13,"that was bad, bad."
494,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,I totally apologized at the first opportunity.
495,00:20:31.13,00:20:31.13,"Two seconds after I said that, I said, man, I'm sorry."
496,00:20:34.67,00:20:34.67,I shouldn't have used that language.
497,00:20:36.40,00:20:36.40,I totally apologize for that.
498,00:20:37.90,00:20:37.90,That was totally uncalled for.
499,00:20:39.90,00:20:39.90,- Never (bleep) with my family.
500,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,"- Yeah, I am deeply..."
501,00:20:42.53,00:20:42.53,- I would never say that about your kids.
502,00:20:43.93,00:20:43.93,- Will you forgive me for that comment?
503,00:20:45.97,00:20:45.97,"Come here, baby-- just forgive me for that comment."
504,00:20:49.40,00:20:49.40,That was totally wrong on my part.
505,00:20:51.90,00:20:51.90,"I'll never say anything like that again, I promise."
506,00:20:55.07,00:20:55.07,"- It's emotion, because it's an emotional game."
507,00:20:57.57,00:20:57.57,"- We're competitive people-- I mean, I understand."
508,00:21:00.13,00:21:00.13,- It terrified me.
509,00:21:01.33,00:21:01.33,I heard a side to you that...
510,00:21:02.60,00:21:02.60,I don't even have that kind of side.
511,00:21:04.43,00:21:04.43,"- Honey, honey, it's okay."
512,00:21:06.13,00:21:06.13,Let's go on. - Thank you.
513,00:21:08.23,00:21:08.23,- Let's do this-- let's do it.
514,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,- We will.
515,00:21:11.07,00:21:11.07,I just needed to get it out.
516,00:21:14.47,00:21:14.47,"- All right, we're ready."
517,00:21:16.23,00:21:16.23,- Survivors ready!
518,00:21:18.47,00:21:18.47,Go!
519,00:21:19.93,00:21:19.93,"At the reward challenge, Kim cost Boran another victory."
520,00:21:25.13,00:21:25.13,- Yeah!
521,00:21:27.90,00:21:27.90,- Samburu!
522,00:21:32.57,00:21:32.57,"- Back at camp, her vulnerability"
523,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,was on everyone's mind.
524,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,- We lost the challenge.
525,00:21:38.03,00:21:38.03,"Unfortunately, you know, it came down to--"
526,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,Kim went really slow.
527,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,"We all said, you know, good job,"
528,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,"you did the best you could, but,"
529,00:21:44.57,00:21:44.57,"you know, really she was like I sucked,"
530,00:21:45.60,00:21:45.60,"and we're like, yeah, you sucked."
531,00:21:47.70,00:21:47.70,"- At Samburu, the mood was upbeat"
532,00:21:50.20,00:21:50.20,"and the tribe finally came together,"
533,00:21:52.33,00:21:52.33,at least for a while.
534,00:21:54.17,00:21:54.17,- We really pulled together today
535,00:21:55.57,00:21:55.57,"and we won some food, and all in all,"
536,00:21:57.63,00:21:57.63,it was an unbelievable victory today.
537,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,"So it boosted up morale,"
538,00:22:01.27,00:22:01.27,"boosted spirits, boosted everything,"
539,00:22:03.33,00:22:03.33,confidence-- it was a good thing.
540,00:22:05.47,00:22:05.47,- Golden chicken blend.
541,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,- Nice.
542,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,"- Oh, to put in the mush."
543,00:22:09.77,00:22:09.77,- Olive oil!
544,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,"- Yeah, olive oil."
545,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,- The basket we won was just amazing.
546,00:22:14.23,00:22:14.23,"We won soup mix, you know, rice,"
547,00:22:16.77,00:22:16.77,"we won, like, jelly to put on stuff."
548,00:22:19.00,00:22:19.00,"I mean, we won an ostrich egg."
549,00:22:21.10,00:22:21.10,- Now that's an egg!
550,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"- So, how do you do that?"
551,00:22:23.27,00:22:23.27,- Scramble it!
552,00:22:24.43,00:22:24.43,"- Scramble it, baby."
553,00:22:25.27,00:22:25.27,- Who wants to go long?
554,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,"Go, Silas."
555,00:22:27.40,00:22:27.40,- We had won 12 different items
556,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87,and one of those items was an ostrich egg-- huge.
557,00:22:33.07,00:22:33.07,"And I think they said it was like 24 chicken eggs,"
558,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,and that was real interesting
559,00:22:37.87,00:22:37.87,"as far as cracking it, watching them shell it."
560,00:22:40.57,00:22:40.57,- Want to be able to pour it? - Yep.
561,00:22:43.00,00:22:43.00,- It's going to have a few shells in the way there.
562,00:22:44.13,00:22:44.13,- Let's try to dust those off.
563,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,"- You got to see this, guys."
564,00:22:46.70,00:22:46.70,"- It's like porcelain,"
565,00:22:48.20,00:22:48.20,"so if you get any shell, watch out, it's sharp."
566,00:22:51.67,00:22:51.67,- First time I've ever seen an ostrich egg or ate one.
567,00:22:54.37,00:22:54.37,No difference to me.
568,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,"I'd hate to carry a dozen of them home, but..."
569,00:23:08.40,00:23:08.40,- How would you like your eggs? - Doesn't matter.
570,00:23:09.70,00:23:09.70,- You and T want to share this?
571,00:23:10.97,00:23:10.97,"Gonna do this slowly, so we don't lose anything."
572,00:23:14.50,00:23:14.50,"- Whoo, delici-oso!"
573,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,"- Hey, Linds and Kim, these are excellent."
574,00:23:19.60,00:23:19.60,- Good.
575,00:23:21.57,00:23:21.57,- We had a beautiful breakfast.
576,00:23:23.30,00:23:23.30,"That humongous ostrich egg, it just was delicious."
577,00:23:26.93,00:23:26.93,"I think it's really picked everyone's spirits up,"
578,00:23:29.53,00:23:29.53,"you know, as a group, more comfortable in the tribe."
579,00:23:32.80,00:23:32.80,People have stuff in their stomach now.
580,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,It was a great morning.
581,00:23:37.23,00:23:37.23,"- Oh, my gosh."
582,00:23:38.27,00:23:38.27,"You guys, this is excellent."
583,00:23:39.33,00:23:39.33,Excellent.
584,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50,"- On Day 12, the power shifted again,"
585,00:23:47.30,00:23:47.30,when Boran won the immunity challenge.
586,00:23:49.80,00:23:49.80,Boran!
587,00:23:51.13,00:23:51.13,(cheering)
588,00:23:57.43,00:23:57.43,"Because they were outnumbered,"
589,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,the three older members of Samburu
590,00:24:01.10,00:24:01.10,knew one of them was about to go.
591,00:24:04.10,00:24:04.10,- We know it's one of us.
592,00:24:05.67,00:24:05.67,Wouldn't you rather know if it's going to be you?
593,00:24:07.73,00:24:07.73,- We can't tell you.
594,00:24:09.27,00:24:09.27,"- Even though the young refused to show their cards,"
595,00:24:12.33,00:24:12.33,Silas had a proposal for the older members.
596,00:24:15.20,00:24:15.20,He wanted them to throw all their votes to Lindsey
597,00:24:18.30,00:24:18.30,in order to keep everyone else vote-free
598,00:24:20.50,00:24:20.50,for the anticipated merge.
599,00:24:21.93,00:24:21.93,"- None of us have one vote against us,"
600,00:24:24.40,00:24:24.40,except for Lindsey.
601,00:24:25.90,00:24:25.90,"I never thought I'd say, vote for me three times tonight."
602,00:24:28.93,00:24:28.93,"Come on, but it will help us--"
603,00:24:31.17,00:24:31.17,it will help us in the end
604,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,"as long as I don't get voted for,"
605,00:24:33.73,00:24:33.73,"you know, once the merger happens."
606,00:24:35.87,00:24:35.87,"- They wouldn't say who's going tonight,"
607,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,but they had a plan they wanted us to follow.
608,00:24:40.73,00:24:40.73,"You know, us, now-- it's funny."
609,00:24:45.40,00:24:45.40,"- At the fourth Tribal Council,"
610,00:24:47.77,00:24:47.77,the older members showed Silas
611,00:24:49.77,00:24:49.77,just what they thought of his plan.
612,00:24:52.10,00:24:52.10,They all voted for him.
613,00:24:54.73,00:24:54.73,But the four younger members all voted for Linda.
614,00:24:57.10,00:24:57.10,"Linda, you need to bring me your torch."
615,00:25:00.10,00:25:00.10,The tribe has spoken.
616,00:25:03.20,00:25:03.20,Things were not looking good for Teresa and Frank.
617,00:25:09.93,00:25:09.93,"- We got mail, and it's probably"
618,00:25:11.43,00:25:11.43,the strangest mail we've ever gotten.
619,00:25:14.03,00:25:14.03,"- On Day 13, a note arrived that changed everything."
620,00:25:18.33,00:25:18.33,"- ""Pick three from your tribe to go on a quest--"
621,00:25:21.30,00:25:21.30,"you get to decide who you feel would be the best."""
622,00:25:23.90,00:25:23.90,- Both tribes made their choices--
623,00:25:26.37,00:25:26.37,"Silas, Frank and Teresa from Samburu,"
624,00:25:29.37,00:25:29.37,"and Tom, Lex and Kelly from Boran,"
625,00:25:32.10,00:25:32.10,hiked back to the original drop point.
626,00:25:34.87,00:25:34.87,What happened next was a bombshell.
627,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27,"Silas, Teresa, Frank, you guys are now members of Boran."
628,00:25:40.27,00:25:40.27,"- Oh, my God."
629,00:25:41.97,00:25:41.97,"- Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys are now members of Samburu."
630,00:25:47.43,00:25:47.43,- Smokes.
631,00:25:52.90,00:25:52.90,"- Oh, my God."
632,00:25:54.10,00:25:54.10,I think the other team is coming here.
633,00:25:55.83,00:25:55.83,- Hi!
634,00:25:56.97,00:25:56.97,- What the heck!
635,00:25:59.93,00:25:59.93,- I'm Boran. Silas.
636,00:26:02.13,00:26:02.13,- Yeah?
637,00:26:03.77,00:26:03.77,"- Everything I'd worked for, all the bonds I had made,"
638,00:26:07.37,00:26:07.37,two closest friends on the team are now gone.
639,00:26:11.13,00:26:11.13,"And I was like, I'm going to have to start over."
640,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,"- Oh, man."
641,00:26:14.23,00:26:14.23,"- At Samburu, the new members"
642,00:26:16.17,00:26:16.17,were not impressed with what they saw.
643,00:26:18.30,00:26:18.30,- How's the firewood?
644,00:26:19.37,00:26:19.37,Do you guys have a lot of wood?
645,00:26:20.37,00:26:20.37,- No.
646,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,- It was obvious these people were napping all day
647,00:26:23.63,00:26:23.63,and they weren't doing-- they weren't doing squat.
648,00:26:26.30,00:26:26.30,- We worked really hard and suffered a lot
649,00:26:28.03,00:26:28.03,"with no food and no water and stuff like that,"
650,00:26:30.10,00:26:30.10,and to see people out here
651,00:26:31.20,00:26:31.20,who just don't take it seriously
652,00:26:32.97,00:26:32.97,and be stuck with them-- it's painful.
653,00:26:41.80,00:26:41.80,"- At Boran, Frank and Teresa suddenly had renewed hope."
654,00:26:45.67,00:26:45.67,"- You know, all this happening today,"
655,00:26:47.30,00:26:47.30,"Frank and I looked at each other and thought,"
656,00:26:49.10,00:26:49.10,you know...
657,00:26:50.70,00:26:50.70,- We're alive again.
658,00:26:52.67,00:26:52.67,- And Silas was desperate.
659,00:26:55.10,00:26:55.10,- Look at me right now.
660,00:26:59.13,00:26:59.13,Let's go get some firewood.
661,00:27:01.57,00:27:01.57,Frank and T are gonna probably vote for me.
662,00:27:04.03,00:27:04.03,- I thought they were with you--
663,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,you said they were with you this morning--
664,00:27:06.53,00:27:06.53,you were gonna get their votes.
665,00:27:08.00,00:27:08.00,"- Well then, which one do you want to take?"
666,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,"- That's what I'm saying. - Well, let's decide, damn it."
667,00:27:11.33,00:27:11.33,- He may be a real nice guy in real life.
668,00:27:12.93,00:27:12.93,In our tribe I don't buy his schmooziness.
669,00:27:15.63,00:27:15.63,- I'm definitely on the other side right now.
670,00:27:17.57,00:27:17.57,I was on the good side-- now I'm on the bad side.
671,00:27:23.47,00:27:23.47,"- At sunset, the new Samburu tribe"
672,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,got ready for their night watch.
673,00:27:27.97,00:27:27.97,- Why don't we each take a new partner?
674,00:27:30.37,00:27:30.37,- Yeah.
675,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,- Why don't we each take somebody from--
676,00:27:32.77,00:27:32.77,so we can get to know each other?
677,00:27:33.93,00:27:33.93,- Good idea.
678,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,- I would like to go first tonight.
679,00:27:39.10,00:27:39.10,I'm gonna be the bad guy.
680,00:27:40.20,00:27:40.20,- I'll be first.
681,00:27:41.03,00:27:41.03,"- First, with me? - Yeah."
682,00:27:42.87,00:27:42.87,"This whole atmosphere of being in Africa,"
683,00:27:46.20,00:27:46.20,"everything's tough-- the weather, animals--"
684,00:27:51.73,00:27:51.73,anything you go to do in Africa is tough.
685,00:27:55.63,00:27:55.63,And then here you are in camp with a powder puff.
686,00:28:00.20,00:28:00.20,- Why can't we pop some corn?
687,00:28:03.30,00:28:03.30,- The first thing I had to do
688,00:28:05.07,00:28:05.07,was just ask him straight up
689,00:28:06.10,00:28:06.10,and get it off my shoulders
690,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,and get the burden out.
691,00:28:11.40,00:28:11.40,"Well, you'll have to tell me a little bit more"
692,00:28:13.60,00:28:13.60,"about your lifestyle,"
693,00:28:15.20,00:28:15.20,'cause I got a lot of questions to ask you.
694,00:28:16.93,00:28:16.93,- About what?
695,00:28:18.00,00:28:18.00,"- Well, are you, uh..."
696,00:28:20.47,00:28:20.47,- About me being gay?
697,00:28:21.70,00:28:21.70,"- Well, are you gay? - Uh-huh."
698,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,- Okay. - I am.
699,00:28:27.50,00:28:27.50,"- See, when I saw you, you know,"
700,00:28:29.87,00:28:29.87,"we didn't know each other and I said,"
701,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,"hell, I think he's gay."
702,00:28:35.23,00:28:35.23,"And they said, gay?!"
703,00:28:37.87,00:28:37.87,"I said, yeah, I think he is."
704,00:28:39.57,00:28:39.57,"I said, he's pretty."
705,00:28:40.63,00:28:40.63,- I wish I still was.
706,00:28:43.03,00:28:43.03,- I will be honest with you.
707,00:28:44.57,00:28:44.57,I can't say as I've ever known a gay man--
708,00:28:47.43,00:28:47.43,"if I did, he was still in the closet."
709,00:28:48.97,00:28:48.97,You know what I'm saying?
710,00:28:50.23,00:28:50.23,"- You know, that's probably it right there-- most--"
711,00:28:51.63,00:28:51.63,a lot of people know them-- they just don't know 'em.
712,00:28:53.40,00:28:53.40,- I got in trouble in college at a gay bar.
713,00:28:56.17,00:28:56.17,I went in and didn't know it was gay.
714,00:28:59.37,00:28:59.37,- And he was talking about something--
715,00:29:01.17,00:29:01.17,he had gone to a gay bar-- I don't even know.
716,00:29:03.10,00:29:03.10,I really wasn't paying that much attention to him.
717,00:29:05.30,00:29:05.30,"You know, with Big T, you can't get mad"
718,00:29:07.27,00:29:07.27,"about anything he says, because he says it"
719,00:29:09.10,00:29:09.10,"with a smile, and I mean, he's very funny."
720,00:29:12.00,00:29:12.00,"- That's his life, and I guess"
721,00:29:15.27,00:29:15.27,"if that's the way you want to live it, have at it."
722,00:29:18.77,00:29:18.77,But it sure ain't mine.
723,00:29:20.47,00:29:20.47,"- And what's really funny, you probably got"
724,00:29:22.47,00:29:22.47,"more in common with me than you do with them,"
725,00:29:24.03,00:29:24.03,since I grew up on a farm and...
726,00:29:25.70,00:29:25.70,"- Mm-hmm, that's what I'm saying."
727,00:29:28.03,00:29:28.03,"- At least we can talk about food and iced tea,"
728,00:29:31.30,00:29:31.30,and country fried chicken.
729,00:29:33.63,00:29:33.63,- Talkin' cornbread and beans.
730,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,"- Oh, you know what I was thinking about the other night?"
731,00:29:37.33,00:29:37.33,Cornbread dipped in buttermilk--
732,00:29:39.53,00:29:39.53,do you ever eat that?
733,00:29:40.83,00:29:40.83,I love cornbread soaked in buttermilk-- mmm!
734,00:29:42.90,00:29:42.90,- My grandparents eat that all the time.
735,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,But I never did really acquire the taste to it.
736,00:29:48.60,00:29:48.60,"- On Day 14, tree mail brought a clue"
737,00:29:51.53,00:29:51.53,for the next reward challenge.
738,00:29:52.97,00:29:52.97,"- ""Will you be the guide to show them the way,"
739,00:29:56.60,00:29:56.60,"""keep them together-- don't let them stray."
740,00:29:58.87,00:29:58.87,"""Their fate's in your hands, so keep them on track,"
741,00:30:02.53,00:30:02.53,"Lock them first and bring new friends back."""
742,00:30:06.03,00:30:06.03,- It said something about
743,00:30:07.60,00:30:07.60,someone was going to be the guide
744,00:30:09.13,00:30:09.13,and we'd have to do something together
745,00:30:10.40,00:30:10.40,and follow the leader type of thing or whatever.
746,00:30:12.87,00:30:12.87,I think we're going to be blindfolded and they're going--
747,00:30:16.87,00:30:16.87,somebody is going to move everybody together.
748,00:30:18.60,00:30:18.60,"- We thought it might be, like,"
749,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,trying to round up your group
750,00:30:21.23,00:30:21.23,and kind of get them to do certain tasks blindfolded.
751,00:30:23.50,00:30:23.50,Don't ask me how we got this idea.
752,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,- One person is going to have to navigate
753,00:30:26.97,00:30:26.97,all the rest of us through a course
754,00:30:29.10,00:30:29.10,"and have to get us all into, like, one area"
755,00:30:30.83,00:30:30.83,like we were cows.
756,00:30:32.07,00:30:32.07,"- Suddenly, my name came up as a volun--"
757,00:30:34.57,00:30:34.57,Why don't you try it?
758,00:30:35.83,00:30:35.83,"So, just basically blindfolded them"
759,00:30:38.53,00:30:38.53,and just moved them around inside...
760,00:30:41.27,00:30:41.27,"Forward, march!"
761,00:30:42.67,00:30:42.67,"Left, right, left, right, left, go left..."
762,00:30:46.90,00:30:46.90,"Left, left, right, left, left, right, left, right,"
763,00:30:52.37,00:30:52.37,"left, right-- soccer players, too."
764,00:30:54.80,00:30:54.80,"Left, right, left, right."
765,00:30:57.07,00:30:57.07,"- It was like an army cadence deal,"
766,00:30:58.97,00:30:58.97,trying to keep us in unison
767,00:31:00.63,00:31:00.63,and get us to do different commands
768,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,and tasks and stuff as a unit.
769,00:31:04.20,00:31:04.20,"- Sidestep right. Go, one, two."
770,00:31:07.23,00:31:07.23,"One, two."
771,00:31:08.23,00:31:08.23,- My brother will be critiquing me--
772,00:31:10.13,00:31:10.13,"he's a First Sergeant in the 82nd Airborne,"
773,00:31:11.53,00:31:11.53,so he'll be critiquing me because there's a lot of stuff
774,00:31:14.30,00:31:14.30,I haven't brushed up on.
775,00:31:15.47,00:31:15.47,"Boran, sidestep, march!"
776,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,- Which direction?
777,00:31:19.73,00:31:19.73,"- To the right, sorry."
778,00:31:21.03,00:31:21.03,- I would say within ten minutes we were--
779,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,"you know, a uniform line going around there."
780,00:31:27.90,00:31:27.90,"- Boran, forward, march."
781,00:31:29.70,00:31:29.70,"Your left, your left, your left,"
782,00:31:32.77,00:31:32.77,"right, left."
783,00:31:34.23,00:31:34.23,"Your left, your left, your left, right, left."
784,00:31:39.17,00:31:39.17,"Boran, stop!"
785,00:31:41.00,00:31:41.00,Left face.
786,00:31:43.50,00:31:43.50,There you go-- open your eyes.
787,00:31:45.30,00:31:45.30,- Good job!
788,00:31:46.63,00:31:46.63,(cheering)
789,00:31:48.80,00:31:48.80,"- Come here, daddy-o."
790,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,- You're very good.
791,00:31:53.50,00:31:53.50,"- But when the tribes arrived for the challenge,"
792,00:31:55.80,00:31:55.80,Boran found that the blindfold exercise
793,00:31:58.30,00:31:58.30,wasn't going to be much help.
794,00:31:59.90,00:31:59.90,First tribe to get their 20 goats into their own pen
795,00:32:02.77,00:32:02.77,at the finish line wins a reward.
796,00:32:05.83,00:32:05.83,"Nonetheless, Boran came through,"
797,00:32:08.40,00:32:08.40,winning three egg-laying chickens
798,00:32:10.20,00:32:10.20,and a rooster as their reward.
799,00:32:12.43,00:32:12.43,(cheering)
800,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,"But when it was time for immunity,"
801,00:32:21.43,00:32:21.43,some members of Boran considered a drastic plan.
802,00:32:25.27,00:32:25.27,"- Kim, this may sound crazy,"
803,00:32:26.67,00:32:26.67,and I've never done this in my life--
804,00:32:28.13,00:32:28.13,"I'm a, you know, I'm an athlete-- I go out to win."
805,00:32:29.73,00:32:29.73,I've never fixed anything.
806,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,"I'm like, what would you think"
807,00:32:33.47,00:32:33.47,if we lost this next challenge on purpose?
808,00:32:36.03,00:32:36.03,It's going to be very tough for me not to win this.
809,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,"I mean, I'll be honest with you."
810,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,"- I talked with Kim and also with Ethan,"
811,00:32:43.63,00:32:43.63,"that if we didn't win this one, that was okay."
812,00:32:46.93,00:32:46.93,- Immunity challenge is a win-win situation.
813,00:32:49.73,00:32:49.73,"We win the challenge, great,"
814,00:32:51.90,00:32:51.90,we don't have to go to Tribal Council.
815,00:32:53.23,00:32:53.23,"We lose, and I get to vote off my biggest threat."
816,00:32:59.47,00:32:59.47,"- That's it, that's it."
817,00:33:00.57,00:33:00.57,"Let's go-- Come on, let's go!"
818,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,- That's exactly what happened.
819,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,- Yes! Yes!
820,00:33:05.40,00:33:05.40,"- It's over, Boran."
821,00:33:06.67,00:33:06.67,"Boran lost, sending them back to Tribal Council."
822,00:33:09.97,00:33:09.97,"Without his former alliance to protect him,"
823,00:33:12.60,00:33:12.60,Silas was voted out of the tribe.
824,00:33:18.60,00:33:18.60,"Well, there's been a lot of assumptions made by you guys"
825,00:33:21.70,00:33:21.70,so far in this game.
826,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,One of them is that in three days there will be a merge.
827,00:33:26.63,00:33:26.63,You can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
828,00:33:39.10,00:33:39.10,"- At the reward challenge on Day 16,"
829,00:33:41.80,00:33:41.80,the young members of Samburu
830,00:33:43.93,00:33:43.93,realized their old ally was no longer in the game.
831,00:33:47.83,00:33:47.83,"- Silas is gone, Silas is gone."
832,00:33:49.63,00:33:49.63,- But that didn't stop Samburu
833,00:33:51.23,00:33:51.23,from winning a picnic lunch.
834,00:33:53.13,00:33:53.13,"Bon appetit, Samburu!"
835,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,(cheering)
836,00:34:01.37,00:34:01.37,- (loud belch)
837,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40,"Back at camp, strategies were once again at full throttle."
838,00:34:09.27,00:34:09.27,Because Lindsey had previous votes
839,00:34:11.37,00:34:11.37,which could be used against her
840,00:34:12.83,00:34:12.83,"to break a deadlock tie at Tribal Council,"
841,00:34:14.90,00:34:14.90,Brandon hoped to shelter her
842,00:34:16.93,00:34:16.93,"by attracting the votes of Kelly,"
843,00:34:18.67,00:34:18.67,Tom and Lex.
844,00:34:20.20,00:34:20.20,"- I mean, I told the girls this is what we would do."
845,00:34:22.63,00:34:22.63,I'll have to just to take a bullet for her.
846,00:34:24.70,00:34:24.70,"- But on Day 18, Kelly caught wind of the plot."
847,00:34:32.87,00:34:32.87,"- We were talking about going to Tribal Council,"
848,00:34:35.27,00:34:35.27,and Kelly was standing
849,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,on the other side of the hut
850,00:34:37.90,00:34:37.90,and we didn't realize it.
851,00:34:39.60,00:34:39.60,So now Lindsey thinks that they know she has votes.
852,00:34:42.37,00:34:42.37,"- I can't believe that Brandon didn't whisper,"
853,00:34:44.27,00:34:44.27,and she was standing right there.
854,00:34:45.90,00:34:45.90,That may have just (bleep) me.
855,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,- There's nothing we can do.
856,00:34:51.97,00:34:51.97,"- Yeah, there is something we can do."
857,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,- What?
858,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,- Vote with them. - Vote with them?
859,00:34:59.90,00:34:59.90,- Lindsey considered turning on Brandon
860,00:35:02.17,00:35:02.17,to save her own skin.
861,00:35:03.80,00:35:03.80,- I'm kind of in a no-win situation.
862,00:35:06.50,00:35:06.50,"I mean, do I go against my personal morals and values"
863,00:35:10.37,00:35:10.37,and vote against Brandon?
864,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,Or do I vote with Brandon and Kim
865,00:35:15.10,00:35:15.10,and risk being the next one voted out of here?
866,00:35:18.77,00:35:18.77,"- But at tribal council,"
867,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,Lindsey stuck with her alliance
868,00:35:21.97,00:35:21.97,and voted against Tom.
869,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,The 3-3 tie the young members had been fearing
870,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,materialized.
871,00:35:28.23,00:35:28.23,"That's three votes Lindsey, three votes Tom."
872,00:35:30.90,00:35:30.90,We're going to vote again.
873,00:35:32.63,00:35:32.63,"When a revote failed to break the tie,"
874,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17,Lindsey's previous votes
875,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,finally came back to haunt her.
876,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,"Lindsey, the tribe has spoken."
877,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"On Day 19, Samburu was anxious to merge."
878,00:35:54.90,00:35:54.90,- We should merge today.
879,00:35:56.87,00:35:56.87,- I hope so.
880,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,"- We may, we may not."
881,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,- Should we pack?
882,00:36:00.23,00:36:00.23,- I think it's probably a very good idea.
883,00:36:02.13,00:36:02.13,Good point.
884,00:36:03.40,00:36:03.40,"- Anything we think we need, put in that basket--"
885,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"in case we have to haul ass,"
886,00:36:07.57,00:36:07.57,we can just grab the basket.
887,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43,- There's only so much you can put in a backpack.
888,00:36:18.40,00:36:18.40,"- Yeah, these backpacks are very limited."
889,00:36:24.30,00:36:24.30,- We definitely was packed and ready to go.
890,00:36:26.47,00:36:26.47,I thought it was like waiting on the bus
891,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,and the bus didn't come.
892,00:36:36.20,00:36:36.20,"- Over at Boran,"
893,00:36:37.57,00:36:37.57,the tribe couldn't sit still any longer.
894,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,- Here we are!
895,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,A lot of visitors since we were last here.
896,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,"- Yeah, you can tell, huh?"
897,00:36:48.87,00:36:48.87,- A lot of visitors.
898,00:36:51.70,00:36:51.70,- And I thought that was just mud.
899,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,- Laundry day at the old stream.
900,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60,"Good thing is, with only two pair of underwear,"
901,00:37:09.30,00:37:09.30,you don't have a lot of laundry to do.
902,00:37:13.07,00:37:13.07,- Ethan is holding guard for us over there.
903,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,"The other day we saw a water buffalo,"
904,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"maybe 30 yards away, which scared us all."
905,00:37:21.43,00:37:21.43,"So Ethan is holding his spear up there,"
906,00:37:24.37,00:37:24.37,"and if he sees anything within any kind of distance,"
907,00:37:27.73,00:37:27.73,he starts making noise and letting us know.
908,00:37:31.87,00:37:31.87,- I'm definitely more on guard than before.
909,00:37:34.30,00:37:34.30,"Lots of activity now and lots of elephants and giraffes,"
910,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,"'cause all the trees are seeding,"
911,00:37:38.03,00:37:38.03,so you never know--
912,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,you never know where any of them will be.
913,00:37:47.07,00:37:47.07,We thought we were going to have
914,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,some sort of reward challenge today--
915,00:37:51.60,00:37:51.60,maybe the merge was going to be today.
916,00:37:53.80,00:37:53.80,Looks like it's just another day
917,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,and we're going to have to wait it out
918,00:37:56.90,00:37:56.90,and see what happens.
919,00:38:02.70,00:38:02.70,"- Oh, my."
920,00:38:05.67,00:38:05.67,"- On Day 20, a clue finally arrived."
921,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,"- ""Raise your hand if you know how to do it..."
922,00:38:15.13,00:38:15.13,"- ""You'll need lots of patience to make it through it."
923,00:38:17.90,00:38:17.90,"The weight on your head lasts as long as your power..."""
924,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"- ""If you let your arm drop, it may be your last shower."""
925,00:38:27.27,00:38:27.27,- We got something nasty.
926,00:38:28.80,00:38:28.80,- But there was still no mention of a merge.
927,00:38:33.63,00:38:33.63,"When the tribes arrived for the challenge,"
928,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,they finally got the news they were waiting for.
929,00:38:38.93,00:38:38.93,The ten of you have now merged into one tribe.
930,00:38:43.80,00:38:43.80,- Congratulations.
931,00:38:46.20,00:38:46.20,- Pick a spot-- let's do it.
932,00:38:49.10,00:38:49.10,"Survivors ready, and begin."
933,00:38:51.70,00:38:51.70,"In the first individual immunity challenge,"
934,00:38:53.87,00:38:53.87,endurance was the name of the game.
935,00:38:56.50,00:38:56.50,"Drop an arm, and lose immunity."
936,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,- Oh!
937,00:39:13.13,00:39:13.13,- Clarence and Teresa outlasted all the rest.
938,00:39:16.63,00:39:16.63,"Feeling he was vulnerable,"
939,00:39:18.13,00:39:18.13,Clarence tried to bargain his way to immunity.
940,00:39:22.33,00:39:22.33,- Let's compromise.
941,00:39:23.80,00:39:23.80,They want me gone.
942,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,- You're trying to trick me and I don't like it.
943,00:39:29.07,00:39:29.07,"- After more than six hours,"
944,00:39:30.77,00:39:30.77,"it came down to a simple game of rock, paper, scissors."
945,00:39:35.17,00:39:35.17,- Paper covers rock.
946,00:39:38.13,00:39:38.13,- Teresa took possession of the immunity necklace
947,00:39:41.80,00:39:41.80,and promised Clarence she wouldn't vote for him
948,00:39:44.00,00:39:44.00,at Tribal Council.
949,00:39:45.90,00:39:45.90,"- ""Make a new flag, decide on a name,"
950,00:39:48.43,00:39:48.43,"""one that you'll keep for the rest of the game."
951,00:39:50.10,00:39:50.10,"""Reach into the basket to give your spirits a lift"
952,00:39:53.10,00:39:53.10,"with this housewarming gift."""
953,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,- Whoo!
954,00:39:57.10,00:39:57.10,"(screaming, cheering)"
955,00:40:05.70,00:40:05.70,"- Back at Camp Boran, the new tribe"
956,00:40:07.80,00:40:07.80,shared wine and personal stories.
957,00:40:10.03,00:40:10.03,- I've never had sex on an airplane.
958,00:40:12.73,00:40:12.73,- I have.
959,00:40:13.83,00:40:13.83,- Oh!
960,00:40:17.00,00:40:17.00,(overlapping chatter)
961,00:40:21.67,00:40:21.67,- Frank had a problem meshing with his new tribe.
962,00:40:24.00,00:40:24.00,"- It was fun,"
963,00:40:25.30,00:40:25.30,"but I wanted to get it over with, though, too."
964,00:40:27.23,00:40:27.23,It's still daylight-- we got time to go get wood.
965,00:40:29.40,00:40:29.40,- Let's get wood. - Let's get wood.
966,00:40:31.47,00:40:31.47,- But he had no trouble bonding with nature.
967,00:40:33.83,00:40:33.83,"- Frank, see the elephant?"
968,00:40:36.93,00:40:36.93,- He's coming this way.
969,00:40:38.73,00:40:38.73,Give this guy room.
970,00:40:43.57,00:40:43.57,The elephant just seemed to be swaying
971,00:40:45.40,00:40:45.40,"and wagging his tail and looking over,"
972,00:40:48.87,00:40:48.87,"and I don't know, at times, it seemed like"
973,00:40:51.07,00:40:51.07,"he might've acknowledged,"
974,00:40:52.13,00:40:52.13,"stopped and looked over, you know?"
975,00:40:57.03,00:40:57.03,"There's a few humans here I wouldn't interact with,"
976,00:41:00.57,00:41:00.57,"you know, but the animals, yes."
977,00:41:09.37,00:41:09.37,"- On Day 21, Teresa kept her word"
978,00:41:12.20,00:41:12.20,and didn't vote for Clarence at Tribal Council.
979,00:41:14.67,00:41:14.67,But the others saw him
980,00:41:16.30,00:41:16.30,as too much of a physical threat to keep around.
981,00:41:19.10,00:41:19.10,"Clarence, the tribe has spoken."
982,00:41:25.67,00:41:25.67,But Lex walked away with two votes against him.
983,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,Nine are left.
984,00:41:31.27,00:41:31.27,Seven of them will make up the jury
985,00:41:32.93,00:41:32.93,that ultimately decides who will be the sole survivor.
986,00:41:36.77,00:41:36.77,"Over the next 18 days, the members"
987,00:41:39.40,00:41:39.40,of the new Moto Maji tribe will experience the land...
988,00:41:44.60,00:41:44.60,the culture...
989,00:41:47.37,00:41:47.37,and the game in ways unlike any survivors before them.
990,00:41:51.63,00:41:51.63,"Join us, as the adventure continues."
991,00:42:02.10,00:42:02.10,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
992,00:42:05.60,00:42:05.60,"- Next time, on Survivor,"
993,00:42:07.77,00:42:07.77,the tribe competes for an unusual reward.
994,00:42:11.00,00:42:11.00,Lex embarks on a witch hunt
995,00:42:13.33,00:42:13.33,to find out who voted against him.
996,00:42:14.87,00:42:14.87,- I need to smoke that person out
997,00:42:16.30,00:42:16.30,in the next three days and cut their heads off.
998,00:42:18.63,00:42:18.63,- And the ex-Samburu members concoct a plan.
999,00:42:21.77,00:42:21.77,"- If we're going to make a move,"
1000,00:42:22.97,00:42:22.97,it has to be this tribal council-- it has to be.
1001,00:42:30.60,00:42:30.60,- I got the hiccups again.
1002,00:42:31.80,00:42:31.80,hiccupping
1003,00:42:36.30,00:42:36.30,(laughing)
1004,00:42:38.13,00:42:38.13,- hiccupping It is funny.
1005,00:42:42.00,00:42:42.00,I can't even talk for hiccupping.
1006,00:42:44.63,00:42:44.63,- Can I stop hiccupping now?
1007,00:42:48.57,00:42:48.57,- Listen to it-- it's synchronized now.
