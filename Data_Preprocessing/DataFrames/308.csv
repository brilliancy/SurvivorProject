127,00:05:52.40,00:05:52.40,I knew she'd be weak.
128,00:05:55.30,00:05:55.30,"- For Boran and Samburu,"
129,00:05:57.20,00:05:57.20,gathering the water wasonly half the battle.
130,00:05:59.60,00:05:59.60,- Anybody knows that youdon't just belly up
131,00:06:01.70,00:06:01.70,"to the stream thatyou're camping next to,"
132,00:06:03.43,00:06:03.43,drop your canteen in itand drink the water.
133,00:06:05.63,00:06:05.63,"If you don't boilyour water out here,"
134,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,"you end up with dysentery,which basically"
135,00:06:09.63,00:06:09.63,has you pukingand crapping your guts out.
136,00:06:13.23,00:06:13.23,"- With no fire to boilthe water,"

138,00:06:18.37,00:06:18.37,and in the dark.

143,00:06:30.13,00:06:30.13,"But Samburu had success, thanksto a lens from a telescope."
144,00:06:33.90,00:06:33.90,"- I unscrewed the telescope,pulled out the lens,"
145,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,"and I was like, Silas,"
146,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,isn't there somethingwe can do with this?
147,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,"Oh, my God."
148,00:06:42.33,00:06:42.33,"You guys, come here--we got fire!"
149,00:06:44.07,00:06:44.07,"- Quick, quick."

151,00:06:47.77,00:06:47.77,- Put the hay on it.Put the hay on it.
152,00:06:50.43,00:06:50.43,(cheering)
153,00:06:56.73,00:06:56.73,- The first immunitychallenge
154,00:06:58.47,00:06:58.47,proved to be more difficultthan anyone expected.
155,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,Go!
156,00:07:05.60,00:07:05.60,(shouting)
157,00:07:09.97,00:07:09.97,It was especially hardon Diane from Boran.
158,00:07:12.90,00:07:12.90,"- Stay awake, look at me."
159,00:07:13.80,00:07:13.80,Look in my eyes.
160,00:07:16.03,00:07:16.03,- Samburu won immunity.
161,00:07:20.23,00:07:20.23,"On day three, as TribalCouncil loomed for Boran,"
162,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,Clarence madea political blunder.
163,00:07:26.33,00:07:26.33,He opened a can of beansto share with Diane
164,00:07:28.53,00:07:28.53,while the otherswere away.
165,00:07:30.20,00:07:30.20,- It's no big deal.
166,00:07:31.73,00:07:31.73,- It's a big deal to me.
167,00:07:32.97,00:07:32.97,"- It's a big dealto me, too."
168,00:07:33.90,00:07:33.90,- It was a judgment callI made.
169,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,- It wasbad damn judgment.
170,00:07:36.30,00:07:36.30,- Today'sa hard day for us.
171,00:07:37.57,00:07:37.57,We have to kick oneof us out.
172,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,Today was not a good dayto do this.
173,00:07:41.53,00:07:41.53,"- But at the firstTribal Council,"
174,00:07:44.13,00:07:44.13,it was Diane whopaid the price
175,00:07:46.03,00:07:46.03,for falteringat the challenge.
176,00:07:47.67,00:07:47.67,She was the first personvoted out of the tribe.
177,00:07:56.30,00:07:56.30,- Can you imagine if you hada girl here that spent time
178,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97,looking in the mirrorputting on makeup?
179,00:08:01.40,00:08:01.40,"I mean, you just...- That's true."
180,00:08:03.10,00:08:03.10,- It's just unbelievable.
181,00:08:04.40,00:08:04.40,- She'd be so the first onevoted off.
182,00:08:14.97,00:08:14.97,- The war paint is...
183,00:08:16.60,00:08:16.60,it was my luxury item--it's something that puts me
184,00:08:19.30,00:08:19.30,in that frame of mindfor what I have to do
185,00:08:21.70,00:08:21.70,"for this tribe,which is be a warrior,"
186,00:08:24.60,00:08:24.60,be an instrumentof our decisions.
187,00:08:29.60,00:08:29.60,- Clarence and his war paintis just a testament
188,00:08:32.77,00:08:32.77,"to his selfishness,and that doesn't fly out here."
189,00:08:35.60,00:08:35.60,He's the tribe's warrior.
190,00:08:37.43,00:08:37.43,What?
191,00:08:39.23,00:08:39.23,"No, no, you're not."
192,00:08:42.23,00:08:42.23,"- If I, like, started puttingmy socks in my boobs,"
193,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,"you know, wouldn't you guysthink I was weird?"
194,00:08:47.27,00:08:47.27,"- Yeah, like it reallymattered out here."
195,00:08:49.07,00:08:49.07,- Right.
196,00:08:51.83,00:08:51.83,"- He painted his abs,you know, with his makeup."
197,00:08:54.20,00:08:54.20,He put blackin between his ab marks
198,00:08:56.63,00:08:56.63,to make 'em stand out.
199,00:08:57.60,00:08:57.60,I think that's stupid.
200,00:08:58.73,00:08:58.73,I thinkit's a little bit silly.
201,00:09:00.37,00:09:00.37,- It's obviously not cool
202,00:09:01.90,00:09:01.90,"to laugh at your fellowtribe members,"
203,00:09:04.83,00:09:04.83,but the makeup...
204,00:09:06.90,00:09:06.90,(laughs)
205,00:09:09.43,00:09:09.43,- He's always lookingin the mirror.
206,00:09:11.13,00:09:11.13,He's so vain.
207,00:09:12.43,00:09:12.43,"I was in a sorority, and I'venever seen any girl"
208,00:09:15.13,00:09:15.13,as vain as Clarence.
209,00:09:18.13,00:09:18.13,"Whatever, though--who am I to talk?"
210,00:09:20.53,00:09:20.53,It's his luxury item.
211,00:09:21.93,00:09:21.93,Have fun-- paint yourself uplike a little clown--
212,00:09:23.53,00:09:23.53,that's fine.
213,00:09:24.60,00:09:24.60,- Do you do that at home?- Huh?
214,00:09:26.23,00:09:26.23,- Do you do that at home?
215,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,- For paint balling.
216,00:09:28.23,00:09:28.23,I just got intopaint balling
217,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,with some peoplethat I met and...
218,00:09:30.87,00:09:30.87,- I guess I meantthe war paint part of it.
219,00:09:33.07,00:09:33.07,I'm not sure I understandhow that fits in with it.
220,00:09:35.37,00:09:35.37,- I got the paint on--I just--
221,00:09:36.50,00:09:36.50,it's time to go to war.
222,00:09:37.60,00:09:37.60,Time to feel stronger.
223,00:09:40.13,00:09:40.13,"- I mean, look--look at where we are."
224,00:09:43.07,00:09:43.07,It's just-- it doesn't get anymore ridiculous than that.
225,00:09:46.37,00:09:46.37,"If nothing else, havingClarence around,"
226,00:09:49.70,00:09:49.70,"it's good,it's good for humor."
227,00:09:53.47,00:09:53.47,"- While Boran was dealingwith questions of vanity,"
228,00:09:56.67,00:09:56.67,Samburu was dealing withquestions of trust.
229,00:09:59.27,00:09:59.27,The older members approachedSilas to join their alliance.
230,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30,- We want you on our side.- We're in a friggin' game.
231,00:10:05.37,00:10:05.37,"It's not a nice game at times.- No, I know what you mean."
232,00:10:07.80,00:10:07.80,- Nobody is gonna hate anybody.- I know.
233,00:10:09.53,00:10:09.53,"- It's a chess match.- It is, man, I know."
234,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,The strongest survive.
235,00:10:12.50,00:10:12.50,I know the--I know the damn game.
236,00:10:14.60,00:10:14.60,Do you guys knowLinda's for sure?
237,00:10:16.63,00:10:16.63,"- Linda's so concrete,"
238,00:10:17.97,00:10:17.97,she's buried in the bottomof the Hoover Dam.
239,00:10:19.93,00:10:19.93,- Lindsey wasimmediately suspicious.
240,00:10:22.50,00:10:22.50,- You better not get mevoted out of here.
241,00:10:23.87,00:10:23.87,"- Trust me, we have got toknock the older people out."
242,00:10:26.50,00:10:26.50,- Are you telling thisto everyone?
243,00:10:27.63,00:10:27.63,"No, I'm serious."
244,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,"- It's funny--I mean, we're here"
245,00:10:30.30,00:10:30.30,to win a million dollars.
246,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80,So I'm going to dowhat it takes to win.
247,00:10:35.43,00:10:35.43,- Survivors ready.
248,00:10:37.27,00:10:37.27,Go!
249,00:10:38.30,00:10:38.30,"At the firstreward challenge,"
250,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50,"the tribes wereneck and neck,"
251,00:10:40.97,00:10:40.97,"until Kim, from Boran,took a fall."
252,00:10:44.50,00:10:44.50,Two feet at the top.
253,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,- Samburu won their secondchallenge in a row.
254,00:10:49.83,00:10:49.83,- Samburu!
255,00:10:51.87,00:10:51.87,"- Nice job, guys."
256,00:10:54.97,00:10:54.97,Day 5 found Jessie sick.
257,00:10:57.27,00:10:57.27,"Unable to drink the water,she was dehydrating quickly."
258,00:11:01.13,00:11:01.13,- Do you havean appetite at all?
259,00:11:02.43,00:11:02.43,- No.
260,00:11:03.47,00:11:03.47,- The guys arebeing really good.
261,00:11:05.17,00:11:05.17,They said it's okay.
262,00:11:06.37,00:11:06.37,"I mean, I don't knowat this point."
263,00:11:10.30,00:11:10.30,I don't know.
264,00:11:13.67,00:11:13.67,"- At Samburu,"
265,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,"with the second immunitychallenge imminent,"
266,00:11:17.20,00:11:17.20,Frank decided to preparein his own special way.
267,00:11:24.80,00:11:24.80,"- Before we head off tothe immunity challenges,"
268,00:11:27.43,00:11:27.43,I make it apoint to go over there
269,00:11:29.37,00:11:29.37,and I grab the setof deer antlers
270,00:11:30.93,00:11:30.93,"I broughtas a luxury item,"
271,00:11:32.27,00:11:32.27,and I begin strikingthem together.
272,00:11:38.53,00:11:38.53,And it's like
273,00:11:39.80,00:11:39.80,two mature White Tail NorthAmerican bucks fighting.
274,00:11:45.80,00:11:45.80,"- Frank has, I thinkthey're deer antlers,"
275,00:11:48.20,00:11:48.20,"and he goes overto the-- our sign,"
276,00:11:52.13,00:11:52.13,our Samburu sign and...freaks out with them.
277,00:11:56.93,00:11:56.93,"- Oh, he's talkingabout the antennas--"
278,00:11:59.30,00:11:59.30,"the antlers, you know."
279,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,"- The antennas?- You know, the..."
280,00:12:02.13,00:12:02.13,- They fight before the...- Yeah.
281,00:12:04.40,00:12:04.40,- It's quite a scene.- It is something to see.
282,00:12:06.77,00:12:06.77,Frank has these deer antlersthat were his luxury item
283,00:12:11.63,00:12:11.63,"that he brought here,as his luxury item."
284,00:12:15.83,00:12:15.83,"Such a redneck, and he, like,bangs them together"
285,00:12:20.10,00:12:20.10,like two...
286,00:12:22.00,00:12:22.00,"something fighting,you know,"
287,00:12:23.43,00:12:23.43,"like it's two hornsclashing,"
288,00:12:25.03,00:12:25.03,like he's this bigtestosterone stud.
289,00:12:27.67,00:12:27.67,"- It's just that spirit,and I'm driven."
290,00:12:30.97,00:12:30.97,I want them to see that--
291,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,"you know,what is he doing,"
292,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,hittingthem on the ground--
293,00:12:34.73,00:12:34.73,"is their paws on the groundand their bodies hitting,"
294,00:12:36.50,00:12:36.50,"you know, and smashing,and I want them to see"
295,00:12:38.30,00:12:38.30,and say Frank'sgetting in the mood--
296,00:12:39.80,00:12:39.80,"look at him, he's gettingin the mood."
297,00:12:40.70,00:12:40.70,And they should be thinking
298,00:12:41.93,00:12:41.93,maybe we should begetting in the mood.
299,00:12:43.00,00:12:43.00,"Come on--yes, we want to win."
300,00:12:44.77,00:12:44.77,"- Look at him,look at him."
301,00:12:45.90,00:12:45.90,Is he intense!
302,00:12:46.97,00:12:46.97,- What's he doing?
303,00:12:48.27,00:12:48.27,"- That's hisdeer horns, man."
304,00:12:49.50,00:12:49.50,That's when the deerfight for supremacy.
305,00:12:51.60,00:12:51.60,"Two deer get together,they buck heads."
306,00:12:56.50,00:12:56.50,- I heard Docsaying that--
307,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97,"that's like the two bucksramming at each other,"
308,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"and who's more powerful,"
309,00:13:02.67,00:13:02.67,and that's Frank's way ofexpressing his enthusiasm
310,00:13:07.33,00:13:07.33,for the next challenge.
311,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,More power to him!
312,00:13:28.83,00:13:28.83,"- Look, look, look.- Oh, my God!"
313,00:13:30.80,00:13:30.80,"- That's the treewe went to yesterday, T."
314,00:13:32.93,00:13:32.93,- Yeah.- Look at them all!
315,00:13:34.73,00:13:34.73,- Look how many there are.- You're spooking them.
316,00:13:37.10,00:13:37.10,"- Awesome!- Oh, my God."
317,00:13:39.60,00:13:39.60,"- On day six,Teresa gave the Samburu tribe"
318,00:13:43.37,00:13:43.37,a little pep talk.
319,00:13:44.73,00:13:44.73,- We got to cometogether as a team.
320,00:13:46.60,00:13:46.60,We're too divided.
321,00:13:48.40,00:13:48.40,"I mean, the tension and thefriction between all of us."
322,00:13:50.87,00:13:50.87,"- Oh, we're together!"
323,00:13:51.97,00:13:51.97,- That's not whatI've been hearing.
324,00:13:53.33,00:13:53.33,I have very perceptive ears.
325,00:13:55.37,00:13:55.37,"- Well, what did we say?"
326,00:13:56.40,00:13:56.40,(overlapping chatter)
327,00:13:59.03,00:13:59.03,- I've heard rumors thatI'm going first--
328,00:14:00.70,00:14:00.70,"Kim's going first,Lindsay's going first,"
329,00:14:02.37,00:14:02.37,Bradford's going first--come on.
330,00:14:03.70,00:14:03.70,- Brandon.
331,00:14:04.93,00:14:04.93,"- Brandon, I'm sorry--I said Bradford."
332,00:14:06.10,00:14:06.10,- Whatever.- I'm serious.
333,00:14:08.13,00:14:08.13,"Let's get it back,what we had."
334,00:14:10.30,00:14:10.30,We don't knowwhat's going to happen
335,00:14:11.43,00:14:11.43,with any of usdown the road.
336,00:14:13.03,00:14:13.03,"None of us know, but we knowthat we're gonna all--"
337,00:14:15.20,00:14:15.20,one by one-- be gone if wedon't win these challenges.
338,00:14:17.37,00:14:17.37,"- I mean, guys,we're all competitors--"
339,00:14:18.77,00:14:18.77,that's why we're onthe team.
340,00:14:20.03,00:14:20.03,We're going to win.- Every day we got to win.
341,00:14:25.90,00:14:25.90,- The note for thesecond immunity challenge
342,00:14:28.47,00:14:28.47,arrived on day six.
343,00:14:30.37,00:14:30.37,- It's a food one!
344,00:14:31.70,00:14:31.70,"- Oh, it'sthe gross food challenge."
345,00:14:33.43,00:14:33.43,- That's all right--I like that.
346,00:14:34.57,00:14:34.57,- Bring it on.
347,00:14:35.60,00:14:35.60,- There's nothingI won't eat.
348,00:14:36.67,00:14:36.67,"You know, it could bebeef brain,"
349,00:14:37.97,00:14:37.97,"goat testicles, whatever."
350,00:14:42.97,00:14:42.97,- But when it came todrinking pure cow blood
351,00:14:45.73,00:14:45.73,"in the tradition ofthe East African tribes,"
352,00:14:48.33,00:14:48.33,"Kelly lost to Linda inthe tie-breaking round,"
353,00:14:51.57,00:14:51.57,giving Samburu theirthird straight victory.
354,00:14:54.37,00:14:54.37,Linda!
355,00:14:55.40,00:14:55.40,"(whooping, cheering)"
356,00:15:01.83,00:15:01.83,"So it was back toTribal Council for Boran,"
357,00:15:05.30,00:15:05.30,"where Clarence, Kim,Jessie and Kelly"
358,00:15:08.07,00:15:08.07,were allfeeling vulnerable.
359,00:15:09.90,00:15:09.90,But the final vote revealedthat Jessie's illness
360,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27,had caught up with her.
361,00:15:13.60,00:15:13.60,She was the second personvoted out of the tribe.
362,00:15:17.40,00:15:17.40,Boran couldn't seemto get a break.
363,00:15:20.50,00:15:20.50,"That night, lionsstalked their camp."
364,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,(lions roaring loudly)
365,00:15:25.10,00:15:25.10,- Go away!
366,00:15:26.57,00:15:26.57,(cans rattling)
367,00:15:32.97,00:15:32.97,"- I mean, it was, it mademy blood run cold."
368,00:15:35.37,00:15:35.37,"We went into this thingknowing, yeah,"
369,00:15:36.80,00:15:36.80,"it's going to be tough,it's going to be real,"
370,00:15:38.20,00:15:38.20,but I don't think anyof us really considered
371,00:15:40.73,00:15:40.73,that it was going tobe quite that real.
372,00:15:43.00,00:15:43.00,"- My mind said stay,but my feet said go."
373,00:15:46.53,00:15:46.53,"I mean, it's all I could do"
374,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,"to keep from justrunning somewhere,"
375,00:15:49.30,00:15:49.30,but there's nowhereto run.
376,00:15:53.30,00:15:53.30,- That was real.
377,00:15:54.33,00:15:54.33,- It's still real.
378,00:15:55.70,00:15:55.70,- This is probably going tohappen every night.
379,00:16:00.63,00:16:00.63,- Survivors ready!
380,00:16:01.40,00:16:01.40,- Ready!- Go!
381,00:16:03.23,00:16:03.23,"At the reward challenge,"
382,00:16:04.60,00:16:04.60,Boran finally gotthe ball rolling.
383,00:16:09.13,00:16:09.13,They had theirfirst taste of victory.
384,00:16:11.47,00:16:11.47,- Boran!- Boran!
385,00:16:15.23,00:16:15.23,- Along with it came100 gallons of fresh water.
386,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,- Hooray!- Whoo!
387,00:16:23.97,00:16:23.97,"- On day eight, Silasended all speculation"
388,00:16:26.87,00:16:26.87,about his loyalties
389,00:16:28.23,00:16:28.23,when he sided with theyounger people of his tribe.
390,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,"- The younger people,I think we've realized"
391,00:16:32.73,00:16:32.73,"that if we don'tstick together,"
392,00:16:34.80,00:16:34.80,we're going to lose this.
393,00:16:35.90,00:16:35.90,"They're going topick us off,"
394,00:16:37.33,00:16:37.33,and I'm not going outthat way.
395,00:16:39.63,00:16:39.63,- They're immature.
396,00:16:41.20,00:16:41.20,"They're trying to get underour skin, and it's working."
397,00:16:43.70,00:16:43.70,- The third immunitychallenge
398,00:16:45.70,00:16:45.70,required the tribes tobuild a distress signal
399,00:16:48.30,00:16:48.30,to be seen froma plane passing overhead.
400,00:16:50.17,00:16:50.17,"- ""Muster all your resourcesand don't stop to gloat."
401,00:16:54.30,00:16:54.30,"Fail to get our attention,you'll be facing the vote."""
402,00:16:58.30,00:16:58.30,- Let's do our S.O.S. likewe're doing-- accentuate it.
403,00:17:02.27,00:17:02.27,They're going to seethat thing.
404,00:17:03.93,00:17:03.93,"- Frankly, the four of uswould like to possibly see"
405,00:17:06.73,00:17:06.73,an older personhave a little weak moment
406,00:17:08.63,00:17:08.63,"in a competition, so they canall open their eyes,"
407,00:17:11.13,00:17:11.13,"becausethey keep coming down,"
408,00:17:12.67,00:17:12.67,saying the weak peopleneed to go.
409,00:17:13.93,00:17:13.93,Just stick with me and we'llweed the weak ones out.
410,00:17:17.40,00:17:17.40,"- At Boran, the planwas to show lots of color."
411,00:17:21.03,00:17:21.03,- I had brought someacrylic paints with me
412,00:17:22.93,00:17:22.93,as my luxury item.
413,00:17:24.43,00:17:24.43,- And a lot of skin.
414,00:17:26.13,00:17:26.13,- We got a black man withwhite tighties on.
415,00:17:28.60,00:17:28.60,We got a big fat manwith a flag waving.
416,00:17:31.43,00:17:31.43,We got two little skinny menwith flags running around.
417,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,Woman in her thong there.
418,00:17:36.87,00:17:36.87,"If that wouldn't stop a plane,I\ want to talk to the pilot."
419,00:17:41.90,00:17:41.90,"- Back at Samburu,Lindsay dehydrated"
420,00:17:44.63,00:17:44.63,under the hot sun.
421,00:17:45.87,00:17:45.87,"- The next thing I know,I looked over"
422,00:17:47.13,00:17:47.13,"and she was sittingunderneath the shade of a tree,"
423,00:17:48.60,00:17:48.60,and it's just not likeher personality
424,00:17:49.90,00:17:49.90,to sit down beforea challenge was over.
425,00:17:52.20,00:17:52.20,I sat with herfor quite a while
426,00:17:53.87,00:17:53.87,"trying to get her to drink,but she kept spitting it up."
427,00:17:56.97,00:17:56.97,- One of the things thatLindsay likes to say
428,00:17:58.97,00:17:58.97,on a regular basis ishow strong she is.
429,00:18:01.53,00:18:01.53,Guess she's not so strong.
430,00:18:04.83,00:18:04.83,"- When the planepassed over,"
431,00:18:07.60,00:18:07.60,it was Boran'sdistress signal
432,00:18:09.17,00:18:09.17,that best caughtthe attention
433,00:18:10.43,00:18:10.43,of the pilotand drop master.
434,00:18:14.50,00:18:14.50,They finally won immunity.
435,00:18:22.73,00:18:22.73,- Yeah!
436,00:18:26.30,00:18:26.30,"- At Samburu's firstTribal Council,"
437,00:18:28.87,00:18:28.87,the young-oldsplit caused a deadlock tie
438,00:18:31.40,00:18:31.40,between Lindsey and Carl.
439,00:18:32.73,00:18:32.73,- We have a tie.
440,00:18:34.00,00:18:34.00,"With no previous votesbetween them,"
441,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70,a sudden death competitiondetermined
442,00:18:38.73,00:18:38.73,that Carl was thefirst Samburu member
443,00:18:40.90,00:18:40.90,to be ousted.
444,00:18:41.93,00:18:41.93,Correct answer: true.Carl...
445,00:18:45.70,00:18:45.70,"- Thank you, God."
446,00:18:46.97,00:18:46.97,- You need tobring me your torch.
447,00:18:47.67,00:18:47.67,"- Sorry, guys."
448,00:18:48.73,00:18:48.73,"- With Carl gone,the young"
449,00:18:50.50,00:18:50.50,were now in control ofSamburu.
450,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,It's time for you to go.
451,00:19:03.13,00:19:03.13,"That night, back at camp,"
452,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,Lindsey couldn'thide her frustration
453,00:19:07.03,00:19:07.03,with the four votesshe had just received.
454,00:19:10.00,00:19:10.00,- Seriously pumped.
455,00:19:11.40,00:19:11.40,"Trust me,when I'm pumped,"
456,00:19:12.77,00:19:12.77,you don't want to(bleep) with me.
457,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,"By the timeI got back to camp,"
458,00:19:15.43,00:19:15.43,"I felt really angry--just like,"
459,00:19:17.53,00:19:17.53,"it all hit me--just like, oh, my God,"
460,00:19:19.37,00:19:19.37,"they picked me,those bastards!"
461,00:19:22.03,00:19:22.03,"- The thing about Lindsey, ofcourse, she handled it wrong."
462,00:19:24.87,00:19:24.87,We needed their support andwe needed to be kind to them.
463,00:19:28.03,00:19:28.03,"But boy, she reallyjust kind of flew off,"
464,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,"you know, the deep end."
465,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,"- On day ten,when tree mail arrived,"
466,00:19:35.20,00:19:35.20,Linda let offa little steam of her own.
467,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,- It's over.
468,00:19:38.60,00:19:38.60,We're coming together now--it's over.
469,00:19:40.73,00:19:40.73,- Thank you!
470,00:19:43.00,00:19:43.00,I've been dying to beon this team!
471,00:19:45.23,00:19:45.23,Let me on the team!
472,00:19:47.30,00:19:47.30,- Linda reallycame unglued.
473,00:19:49.03,00:19:49.03,"She has two very,very different sides--"
474,00:19:51.97,00:19:51.97,"like this sweet,little New England mom,"
475,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,"and then there's this--I don't know,"
476,00:19:57.43,00:19:57.43,"crazy woman side, too."
477,00:19:59.57,00:19:59.57,- I'm readyto be on the team!
478,00:20:01.50,00:20:01.50,"Ready to beon the team, honey."
479,00:20:02.97,00:20:02.97,Can I have a hug?
480,00:20:03.90,00:20:03.90,"See, you're evenhesitating."
481,00:20:05.27,00:20:05.27,Give me a hug.
482,00:20:07.20,00:20:07.20,"You know, why can't youhug me?"
483,00:20:08.90,00:20:08.90,When I went to motionfor a hug
484,00:20:11.27,00:20:11.27,"and she literally froze likethis, and her eyes were just--"
485,00:20:13.97,00:20:13.97,"she like, panicked,like don't come near me,"
486,00:20:15.90,00:20:15.90,like she was frightened.
487,00:20:17.60,00:20:17.60,Did your mamanever hug you?
488,00:20:19.57,00:20:19.57,There you go.
489,00:20:20.70,00:20:20.70,"I said oh, yourmama didn't hug you?"
490,00:20:23.57,00:20:23.57,That was inappropriate.
491,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,"That was low--that was wrong,"
492,00:20:26.13,00:20:26.13,"that was bad, bad."
493,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,I totally apologized atthe first opportunity.
494,00:20:31.13,00:20:31.13,"Two seconds after I said that,I said, man, I'm sorry."
495,00:20:34.67,00:20:34.67,I shouldn't haveused that language.
496,00:20:36.40,00:20:36.40,I totallyapologize for that.
497,00:20:37.90,00:20:37.90,That was totallyuncalled for.
498,00:20:39.90,00:20:39.90,- Never (bleep)with my family.
499,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,"- Yeah, I am deeply..."
500,00:20:42.53,00:20:42.53,- I would never say thatabout your kids.
501,00:20:43.93,00:20:43.93,- Will you forgive mefor that comment?
502,00:20:45.97,00:20:45.97,"Come here, baby-- justforgive me for that comment."
503,00:20:49.40,00:20:49.40,That was totally wrongon my part.
504,00:20:51.90,00:20:51.90,"I'll never say anythinglike that again, I promise."
505,00:20:55.07,00:20:55.07,"- It's emotion, becauseit's an emotional game."
506,00:20:57.57,00:20:57.57,"- We're competitive people--I mean, I understand."
507,00:21:00.13,00:21:00.13,- It terrified me.
508,00:21:01.33,00:21:01.33,I hearda side to you that...
509,00:21:02.60,00:21:02.60,I don't even havethat kind of side.
510,00:21:04.43,00:21:04.43,"- Honey, honey, it's okay."
511,00:21:06.13,00:21:06.13,Let's go on.- Thank you.
512,00:21:08.23,00:21:08.23,- Let's do this--let's do it.
513,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,- We will.
514,00:21:11.07,00:21:11.07,I just neededto get it out.
515,00:21:14.47,00:21:14.47,"- All right, we're ready."
516,00:21:16.23,00:21:16.23,- Survivors ready!
517,00:21:18.47,00:21:18.47,Go!
518,00:21:19.93,00:21:19.93,"At the reward challenge, Kimcost Boran another victory."
519,00:21:25.13,00:21:25.13,- Yeah!
520,00:21:27.90,00:21:27.90,- Samburu!
521,00:21:32.57,00:21:32.57,"- Back at camp,her vulnerability"
522,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,was on everyone's mind.
523,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,- We lost the challenge.
524,00:21:38.03,00:21:38.03,"Unfortunately, you know,it came down to--"
525,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,Kim went really slow.
526,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,"We all said,you know, good job,"
527,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,"you did the bestyou could, but,"
528,00:21:44.57,00:21:44.57,"you know, really shewas like I sucked,"
529,00:21:45.60,00:21:45.60,"and we're like, yeah,you sucked."
530,00:21:47.70,00:21:47.70,"- At Samburu,the mood was upbeat"
531,00:21:50.20,00:21:50.20,"and the tribefinally came together,"
532,00:21:52.33,00:21:52.33,at least for a while.
533,00:21:54.17,00:21:54.17,- We reallypulled together today
534,00:21:55.57,00:21:55.57,"and we won some food,and all in all,"
535,00:21:57.63,00:21:57.63,it was an unbelievablevictory today.
536,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,"So it boosted up morale,"
537,00:22:01.27,00:22:01.27,"boosted spirits,boosted everything,"
538,00:22:03.33,00:22:03.33,confidence--it was a good thing.
539,00:22:05.47,00:22:05.47,- Golden chicken blend.
540,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,- Nice.
541,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,"- Oh, to put in the mush."

545,00:22:14.23,00:22:14.23,"We won soup mix,you know, rice,"
546,00:22:16.77,00:22:16.77,"we won, like,jelly to put on stuff."

548,00:22:21.10,00:22:21.10,- Now that's an egg!
549,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"- So, how do you do that?"

555,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87,and one of those items wasan ostrich egg-- huge.
556,00:22:33.07,00:22:33.07,"And I think they said itwas like 24 chicken eggs,"
557,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,and thatwas real interesting
558,00:22:37.87,00:22:37.87,"as far as cracking it,watching them shell it."
559,00:22:40.57,00:22:40.57,- Want to be able to pour it?- Yep.
560,00:22:43.00,00:22:43.00,- It's going to have a fewshells in the way there.
561,00:22:44.13,00:22:44.13,- Let's try todust those off.
562,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,"- You got tosee this, guys."
563,00:22:46.70,00:22:46.70,"- It's like porcelain,"
564,00:22:48.20,00:22:48.20,"so if you get any shell,watch out, it's sharp."
565,00:22:51.67,00:22:51.67,- First time I've ever seenan ostrich egg or ate one.
566,00:22:54.37,00:22:54.37,No difference to me.

577,00:23:29.53,00:23:29.53,"you know, as a group,more comfortable in the tribe."

586,00:23:51.13,00:23:51.13,(cheering)
587,00:23:57.43,00:23:57.43,"Because theywere outnumbered,"
588,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,the three older membersof Samburu
589,00:24:01.10,00:24:01.10,knew one of them wasabout to go.
590,00:24:04.10,00:24:04.10,- We know it's one of us.
591,00:24:05.67,00:24:05.67,Wouldn't you rather knowif it's going to be you?
592,00:24:07.73,00:24:07.73,- We can't tell you.
593,00:24:09.27,00:24:09.27,"- Even though the youngrefused to show their cards,"
594,00:24:12.33,00:24:12.33,Silas had a proposal forthe older members.
595,00:24:15.20,00:24:15.20,He wanted them to throw alltheir votes to Lindsey
596,00:24:18.30,00:24:18.30,in order to keep everyoneelse vote-free
597,00:24:20.50,00:24:20.50,for the anticipated merge.
598,00:24:21.93,00:24:21.93,"- None of us haveone vote against us,"
599,00:24:24.40,00:24:24.40,except for Lindsey.
600,00:24:25.90,00:24:25.90,"I never thought I'd say, votefor me three times tonight."
601,00:24:28.93,00:24:28.93,"Come on,but it will help us--"
602,00:24:31.17,00:24:31.17,it will help us in the end
603,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,"as longas I don't get voted for,"
604,00:24:33.73,00:24:33.73,"you know,once the merger happens."
605,00:24:35.87,00:24:35.87,"- They wouldn't saywho's going tonight,"
606,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,but they had a planthey wanted us to follow.
607,00:24:40.73,00:24:40.73,"You know, us, now--it's funny."
608,00:24:45.40,00:24:45.40,"- At the fourth TribalCouncil,"
609,00:24:47.77,00:24:47.77,the older membersshowed Silas
610,00:24:49.77,00:24:49.77,just what theythought of his plan.
611,00:24:52.10,00:24:52.10,They all voted for him.
612,00:24:54.73,00:24:54.73,But the four younger membersall voted for Linda.
613,00:24:57.10,00:24:57.10,"Linda, you need tobring me your torch."
614,00:25:00.10,00:25:00.10,The tribe has spoken.
615,00:25:03.20,00:25:03.20,Things were not lookinggood for Teresa and Frank.
616,00:25:09.93,00:25:09.93,"- We got mail,and it's probably"
617,00:25:11.43,00:25:11.43,the strangest mailwe've ever gotten.
618,00:25:14.03,00:25:14.03,"- On Day 13, a note arrivedthat changed everything."
619,00:25:18.33,00:25:18.33,"- ""Pick three from your tribeto go on a quest--"
620,00:25:21.30,00:25:21.30,"you get to decide who youfeel would be the best."""
621,00:25:23.90,00:25:23.90,- Both tribes madetheir choices--
622,00:25:26.37,00:25:26.37,"Silas, Frank andTeresa from Samburu,"
623,00:25:29.37,00:25:29.37,"and Tom,Lex and Kelly from Boran,"
624,00:25:32.10,00:25:32.10,hiked back to theoriginal drop point.
625,00:25:34.87,00:25:34.87,What happened nextwas a bombshell.
626,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27,"Silas, Teresa, Frank, youguys are now members of Boran."
627,00:25:40.27,00:25:40.27,"- Oh, my God."
628,00:25:41.97,00:25:41.97,"- Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guysare now members of Samburu."
629,00:25:47.43,00:25:47.43,- Smokes.
630,00:25:52.90,00:25:52.90,"- Oh, my God."
631,00:25:54.10,00:25:54.10,I think the other teamis coming here.
632,00:25:55.83,00:25:55.83,- Hi!
633,00:25:56.97,00:25:56.97,- What the heck!
634,00:25:59.93,00:25:59.93,- I'm Boran. Silas.
635,00:26:02.13,00:26:02.13,- Yeah?
636,00:26:03.77,00:26:03.77,"- Everything I'd worked for,all the bonds I had made,"
637,00:26:07.37,00:26:07.37,two closest friendson the team are now gone.
638,00:26:11.13,00:26:11.13,"And I was like, I'm going tohave to start over."
639,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,"- Oh, man."
640,00:26:14.23,00:26:14.23,"- At Samburu,the new members"
641,00:26:16.17,00:26:16.17,were not impressed withwhat they saw.
642,00:26:18.30,00:26:18.30,- How's the firewood?
643,00:26:19.37,00:26:19.37,Do you guyshave a lot of wood?
644,00:26:20.37,00:26:20.37,- No.
645,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,- It was obvious these peoplewere napping all day
646,00:26:23.63,00:26:23.63,and they weren't doing--they weren't doing squat.
647,00:26:26.30,00:26:26.30,- We worked really hardand suffered a lot
648,00:26:28.03,00:26:28.03,"with no food andno water and stuff like that,"
649,00:26:30.10,00:26:30.10,and to see people out here
650,00:26:31.20,00:26:31.20,who justdon't take it seriously
651,00:26:32.97,00:26:32.97,and be stuck with them--it's painful.
652,00:26:41.80,00:26:41.80,"- At Boran, Frank and Teresasuddenly had renewed hope."
653,00:26:45.67,00:26:45.67,"- You know, all thishappening today,"
654,00:26:47.30,00:26:47.30,"Frank and I looked ateach other and thought,"
655,00:26:49.10,00:26:49.10,you know...
656,00:26:50.70,00:26:50.70,- We're alive again.
657,00:26:52.67,00:26:52.67,- And Silas wasdesperate.
658,00:26:55.10,00:26:55.10,- Look at me right now.
659,00:26:59.13,00:26:59.13,Let's goget some firewood.
660,00:27:01.57,00:27:01.57,Frank and T are gonnaprobably vote for me.
661,00:27:04.03,00:27:04.03,- I thought theywere with you--
662,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,you said they were with youthis morning--
663,00:27:06.53,00:27:06.53,you were gonnaget their votes.
664,00:27:08.00,00:27:08.00,"- Well then, which onedo you want to take?"
665,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,"- That's what I'm saying.- Well, let's decide, damn it."
666,00:27:11.33,00:27:11.33,- He may be a real nice guyin real life.
667,00:27:12.93,00:27:12.93,In our tribe I don'tbuy his schmooziness.
668,00:27:15.63,00:27:15.63,- I'm definitely onthe other side right now.
669,00:27:17.57,00:27:17.57,I was on the good side--now I'm on the bad side.
670,00:27:23.47,00:27:23.47,"- At sunset,the new Samburu tribe"
671,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,got ready fortheir night watch.
672,00:27:27.97,00:27:27.97,- Why don't we eachtake a new partner?
673,00:27:30.37,00:27:30.37,- Yeah.
674,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,- Why don't we each takesomebody from--
675,00:27:32.77,00:27:32.77,so we can get toknow each other?
676,00:27:33.93,00:27:33.93,- Good idea.
677,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,- I would like to go firsttonight.
678,00:27:39.10,00:27:39.10,I'm gonna be the bad guy.
679,00:27:40.20,00:27:40.20,- I'll be first.
680,00:27:41.03,00:27:41.03,"- First, with me?- Yeah."
681,00:27:42.87,00:27:42.87,"This whole atmosphereof being in Africa,"
682,00:27:46.20,00:27:46.20,"everything's tough--the weather, animals--"
683,00:27:51.73,00:27:51.73,anything you go to doin Africa is tough.
684,00:27:55.63,00:27:55.63,And then here you are incamp with a powder puff.
685,00:28:00.20,00:28:00.20,- Why can't wepop some corn?
686,00:28:03.30,00:28:03.30,- The first thingI had to do
687,00:28:05.07,00:28:05.07,was just ask him straight up
688,00:28:06.10,00:28:06.10,and get it offmy shoulders
689,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,and getthe burden out.
690,00:28:11.40,00:28:11.40,"Well, you'll have totell me a little bit more"
691,00:28:13.60,00:28:13.60,"about your lifestyle,"
692,00:28:15.20,00:28:15.20,'cause I got a lot ofquestions to ask you.
693,00:28:16.93,00:28:16.93,- About what?
694,00:28:18.00,00:28:18.00,"- Well, are you, uh..."
695,00:28:20.47,00:28:20.47,- About me being gay?
696,00:28:21.70,00:28:21.70,"- Well, are you gay?- Uh-huh."
697,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,- Okay.- I am.
698,00:28:27.50,00:28:27.50,"- See, when I saw you,you know,"
699,00:28:29.87,00:28:29.87,"we didn't know each otherand I said,"
700,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,"hell, I think he's gay."
701,00:28:35.23,00:28:35.23,"And they said, gay?!"
702,00:28:37.87,00:28:37.87,"I said,yeah, I think he is."
703,00:28:39.57,00:28:39.57,"I said, he's pretty."
704,00:28:40.63,00:28:40.63,- I wish I still was.
705,00:28:43.03,00:28:43.03,- I will behonest with you.
706,00:28:44.57,00:28:44.57,I can't say as I've everknown a gay man--
707,00:28:47.43,00:28:47.43,"if I did, he was stillin the closet."
708,00:28:48.97,00:28:48.97,You know what I'm saying?
709,00:28:50.23,00:28:50.23,"- You know, that's probablyit right there-- most--"
710,00:28:51.63,00:28:51.63,a lot of people know them--they just don't know 'em.
711,00:28:53.40,00:28:53.40,- I got in trouble incollege at a gay bar.
712,00:28:56.17,00:28:56.17,I went in and didn'tknow it was gay.
713,00:28:59.37,00:28:59.37,- And he was talking aboutsomething--
714,00:29:01.17,00:29:01.17,he had gone to a gay bar--I don't even know.
715,00:29:03.10,00:29:03.10,I really wasn't paying thatmuch attention to him.
716,00:29:05.30,00:29:05.30,"You know, with Big T,you can't get mad"
717,00:29:07.27,00:29:07.27,"about anything he says,because he says it"
718,00:29:09.10,00:29:09.10,"with a smile,and I mean, he's very funny."
719,00:29:12.00,00:29:12.00,"- That's his life,and I guess"
720,00:29:15.27,00:29:15.27,"if that's the way you want tolive it, have at it."
721,00:29:18.77,00:29:18.77,But it sure ain't mine.
722,00:29:20.47,00:29:20.47,"- And what's really funny,you probably got"
723,00:29:22.47,00:29:22.47,"more in common with methan you do with them,"
724,00:29:24.03,00:29:24.03,since I grew upon a farm and...
725,00:29:25.70,00:29:25.70,"- Mm-hmm, that'swhat I'm saying."
726,00:29:28.03,00:29:28.03,"- At least we can talkabout food and iced tea,"
727,00:29:31.30,00:29:31.30,and country fried chicken.
728,00:29:33.63,00:29:33.63,- Talkin'cornbread and beans.
729,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,"- Oh, you know what I wasthinking about the other night?"
730,00:29:37.33,00:29:37.33,Cornbreaddipped in buttermilk--
731,00:29:39.53,00:29:39.53,do you ever eat that?
732,00:29:40.83,00:29:40.83,I love cornbread soaked inbuttermilk-- mmm!
733,00:29:42.90,00:29:42.90,- My grandparentseat that all the time.
734,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,But I never did reallyacquire the taste to it.
735,00:29:48.60,00:29:48.60,"- On Day 14, tree mailbrought a clue"
736,00:29:51.53,00:29:51.53,for the nextreward challenge.
737,00:29:52.97,00:29:52.97,"- ""Will you be the guide toshow them the way,"
738,00:29:56.60,00:29:56.60,"""keep them together--don't let them stray."
739,00:29:58.87,00:29:58.87,"""Their fate's in your hands,so keep them on track,"
740,00:30:02.53,00:30:02.53,"Lock them first and bringnew friends back."""
741,00:30:06.03,00:30:06.03,- It said somethingabout
742,00:30:07.60,00:30:07.60,someone was going tobe the guide
743,00:30:09.13,00:30:09.13,and we'd have to dosomething together
744,00:30:10.40,00:30:10.40,and follow the leadertype of thing or whatever.
745,00:30:12.87,00:30:12.87,I think we're going to beblindfolded and they're going--
746,00:30:16.87,00:30:16.87,somebody is going to moveeverybody together.
747,00:30:18.60,00:30:18.60,"- We thoughtit might be, like,"
748,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,trying toround up your group
749,00:30:21.23,00:30:21.23,and kind of get them to docertain tasks blindfolded.
750,00:30:23.50,00:30:23.50,Don't ask mehow we got this idea.
751,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,- One person is going tohave to navigate
752,00:30:26.97,00:30:26.97,all the rest of usthrough a course
753,00:30:29.10,00:30:29.10,"and have to getus all into, like, one area"
754,00:30:30.83,00:30:30.83,like we were cows.
755,00:30:32.07,00:30:32.07,"- Suddenly, my namecame up as a volun--"
756,00:30:34.57,00:30:34.57,Why don't you try it?
757,00:30:35.83,00:30:35.83,"So, just basicallyblindfolded them"
758,00:30:38.53,00:30:38.53,and just moved themaround inside...
759,00:30:41.27,00:30:41.27,"Forward, march!"
760,00:30:42.67,00:30:42.67,"Left, right, left, right,left, go left..."
761,00:30:46.90,00:30:46.90,"Left, left, right, left,left, right, left, right,"
762,00:30:52.37,00:30:52.37,"left, right--soccer players, too."
763,00:30:54.80,00:30:54.80,"Left, right, left, right."
764,00:30:57.07,00:30:57.07,"- It was likean army cadence deal,"
765,00:30:58.97,00:30:58.97,trying to keep us inunison
766,00:31:00.63,00:31:00.63,and get us to dodifferent commands
767,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,and tasks andstuff as a unit.
768,00:31:04.20,00:31:04.20,"- Sidestep right.Go, one, two."
769,00:31:07.23,00:31:07.23,"One, two."
770,00:31:08.23,00:31:08.23,- My brother will becritiquing me--
771,00:31:10.13,00:31:10.13,"he's a First Sergeant inthe 82nd Airborne,"
772,00:31:11.53,00:31:11.53,so he'll be critiquing mebecause there's a lot of stuff
773,00:31:14.30,00:31:14.30,I haven't brushed up on.
774,00:31:15.47,00:31:15.47,"Boran, sidestep, march!"
775,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,- Which direction?
776,00:31:19.73,00:31:19.73,"- To the right, sorry."
777,00:31:21.03,00:31:21.03,- I would say withinten minutes we were--
778,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,"you know, a uniform linegoing around there."
779,00:31:27.90,00:31:27.90,"- Boran, forward, march."
780,00:31:29.70,00:31:29.70,"Your left,your left, your left,"
781,00:31:32.77,00:31:32.77,"right, left."
782,00:31:34.23,00:31:34.23,"Your left, your left,your left, right, left."
783,00:31:39.17,00:31:39.17,"Boran, stop!"
784,00:31:41.00,00:31:41.00,Left face.
785,00:31:43.50,00:31:43.50,There you go--open your eyes.
786,00:31:45.30,00:31:45.30,- Good job!
787,00:31:46.63,00:31:46.63,(cheering)
788,00:31:48.80,00:31:48.80,"- Come here, daddy-o."
789,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,- You're very good.
790,00:31:53.50,00:31:53.50,"- But when the tribesarrived for the challenge,"
791,00:31:55.80,00:31:55.80,Boran found thatthe blindfold exercise
792,00:31:58.30,00:31:58.30,wasn't going to bemuch help.
793,00:31:59.90,00:31:59.90,First tribe to get their 20goats into their own pen
794,00:32:02.77,00:32:02.77,at the finish linewins a reward.
795,00:32:05.83,00:32:05.83,"Nonetheless,Boran came through,"
796,00:32:08.40,00:32:08.40,winning threeegg-laying chickens
797,00:32:10.20,00:32:10.20,and a rooster as theirreward.
798,00:32:12.43,00:32:12.43,(cheering)
799,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,"But when it was timefor immunity,"
800,00:32:21.43,00:32:21.43,some members of Boranconsidered a drastic plan.
801,00:32:25.27,00:32:25.27,"- Kim, this maysound crazy,"
802,00:32:26.67,00:32:26.67,and I've never donethis in my life--
803,00:32:28.13,00:32:28.13,"I'm a, you know, I'm anathlete-- I go out to win."
804,00:32:29.73,00:32:29.73,I've never fixed anything.
805,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,"I'm like,what would you think"
806,00:32:33.47,00:32:33.47,if we lost this nextchallenge on purpose?
807,00:32:36.03,00:32:36.03,It's going to be very toughfor me not to win this.
808,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,"I mean,I'll be honest with you."
809,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,"- I talked with Kimand also with Ethan,"
810,00:32:43.63,00:32:43.63,"that if we didn'twin this one, that was okay."
811,00:32:46.93,00:32:46.93,- Immunity challengeis a win-win situation.
812,00:32:49.73,00:32:49.73,"We win the challenge,great,"
813,00:32:51.90,00:32:51.90,we don't have to goto Tribal Council.
814,00:32:53.23,00:32:53.23,"We lose, and I get to voteoff my biggest threat."
815,00:32:59.47,00:32:59.47,"- That's it, that's it."
816,00:33:00.57,00:33:00.57,"Let's go--Come on, let's go!"
817,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,- That's exactly whathappened.
818,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,- Yes! Yes!
819,00:33:05.40,00:33:05.40,"- It's over, Boran."
820,00:33:06.67,00:33:06.67,"Boran lost, sending themback to Tribal Council."
821,00:33:09.97,00:33:09.97,"Without his formeralliance to protect him,"
822,00:33:12.60,00:33:12.60,Silas was voted outof the tribe.
823,00:33:18.60,00:33:18.60,"Well, there's been a lot ofassumptions made by you guys"
824,00:33:21.70,00:33:21.70,so far in this game.
825,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,One of them is that in threedays there will be a merge.
826,00:33:26.63,00:33:26.63,You can head back to camp.I'll see you tomorrow.
827,00:33:39.10,00:33:39.10,"- At the rewardchallenge on Day 16,"
828,00:33:41.80,00:33:41.80,the youngmembers of Samburu
829,00:33:43.93,00:33:43.93,realized their old ally wasno longer in the game.
830,00:33:47.83,00:33:47.83,"- Silas is gone,Silas is gone."
831,00:33:49.63,00:33:49.63,- But that didn'tstop Samburu
832,00:33:51.23,00:33:51.23,from winninga picnic lunch.
833,00:33:53.13,00:33:53.13,"Bon appetit, Samburu!"
834,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,(cheering)
835,00:34:01.37,00:34:01.37,- (loud belch)
836,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40,"Back at camp, strategies wereonce again at full throttle."
837,00:34:09.27,00:34:09.27,Because Lindseyhad previous votes
838,00:34:11.37,00:34:11.37,which could beused against her
839,00:34:12.83,00:34:12.83,"to break a deadlock tieat Tribal Council,"
840,00:34:14.90,00:34:14.90,Brandonhoped to shelter her
841,00:34:16.93,00:34:16.93,"by attractingthe votes of Kelly,"
842,00:34:18.67,00:34:18.67,Tom and Lex.
843,00:34:20.20,00:34:20.20,"- I mean, I told the girlsthis is what we would do."
844,00:34:22.63,00:34:22.63,I'll have to just totake a bullet for her.
845,00:34:24.70,00:34:24.70,"- But on Day 18, Kellycaught wind of the plot."
846,00:34:32.87,00:34:32.87,"- We were talking about goingto Tribal Council,"
847,00:34:35.27,00:34:35.27,and Kelly was standing
848,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,on the other side ofthe hut
849,00:34:37.90,00:34:37.90,and we didn't realize it.
850,00:34:39.60,00:34:39.60,So now Lindsey thinks thatthey know she has votes.
851,00:34:42.37,00:34:42.37,"- I can't believe thatBrandon didn't whisper,"
852,00:34:44.27,00:34:44.27,and she wasstanding right there.
853,00:34:45.90,00:34:45.90,That mayhave just (bleep) me.
854,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,- There's nothingwe can do.
855,00:34:51.97,00:34:51.97,"- Yeah, there issomething we can do."
856,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,- What?
857,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,- Vote with them.- Vote with them?
858,00:34:59.90,00:34:59.90,- Lindsey consideredturning on Brandon
859,00:35:02.17,00:35:02.17,to save her own skin.
860,00:35:03.80,00:35:03.80,- I'm kind ofin a no-win situation.
861,00:35:06.50,00:35:06.50,"I mean, do I go against mypersonal morals and values"
862,00:35:10.37,00:35:10.37,and vote againstBrandon?
863,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,Or do I vote withBrandon and Kim
864,00:35:15.10,00:35:15.10,and risk being the next onevoted out of here?
865,00:35:18.77,00:35:18.77,"- But at tribal council,"
866,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,Lindsey stuck with heralliance
867,00:35:21.97,00:35:21.97,and voted against Tom.
868,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,The 3-3 tie the young membershad been fearing
869,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,materialized.
870,00:35:28.23,00:35:28.23,"That's three votes Lindsey,three votes Tom."
871,00:35:30.90,00:35:30.90,We're going to vote again.
872,00:35:32.63,00:35:32.63,"When a revote failed tobreak the tie,"
873,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17,Lindsey's previous votes
874,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,finally came backto haunt her.
875,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,"Lindsey,the tribe has spoken."
876,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"On Day 19,Samburu was anxious to merge."
877,00:35:54.90,00:35:54.90,- We should merge today.
878,00:35:56.87,00:35:56.87,- I hope so.
879,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,"- We may, we may not."
880,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,- Should we pack?
881,00:36:00.23,00:36:00.23,- I think it's probablya very good idea.
882,00:36:02.13,00:36:02.13,Good point.
883,00:36:03.40,00:36:03.40,"- Anything we think we need,put in that basket--"
884,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"in case wehave to haul ass,"
885,00:36:07.57,00:36:07.57,we can justgrab the basket.
886,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43,- There's only so much you canput in a backpack.
887,00:36:18.40,00:36:18.40,"- Yeah, these backpacks arevery limited."
888,00:36:24.30,00:36:24.30,- We definitely was packedand ready to go.
889,00:36:26.47,00:36:26.47,I thought it was likewaiting on the bus
890,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,and the bus didn't come.
891,00:36:36.20,00:36:36.20,"- Over at Boran,"
892,00:36:37.57,00:36:37.57,the tribe couldn't sitstill any longer.
893,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,- Here we are!
894,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,A lot of visitors since wewere last here.
895,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,"- Yeah, you can tell, huh?"
896,00:36:48.87,00:36:48.87,- A lot of visitors.
897,00:36:51.70,00:36:51.70,- And I thought thatwas just mud.
898,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,- Laundry dayat the old stream.
899,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60,"Good thing is, with onlytwo pair of underwear,"
900,00:37:09.30,00:37:09.30,you don't have alot of laundry to do.
901,00:37:13.07,00:37:13.07,- Ethan is holding guardfor us over there.
902,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,"The other day we sawa water buffalo,"
903,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"maybe 30 yards away,which scared us all."
904,00:37:21.43,00:37:21.43,"So Ethan is holdinghis spear up there,"
905,00:37:24.37,00:37:24.37,"and if he sees anythingwithin any kind of distance,"
906,00:37:27.73,00:37:27.73,he starts making noiseand letting us know.
907,00:37:31.87,00:37:31.87,- I'm definitely moreon guard than before.
908,00:37:34.30,00:37:34.30,"Lots of activity now and lotsof elephants and giraffes,"
909,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,"'causeall the trees are seeding,"
910,00:37:38.03,00:37:38.03,so you never know--
911,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,you never know whereany of them will be.
912,00:37:47.07,00:37:47.07,We thoughtwe were going to have
913,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,some sort ofreward challenge today--
914,00:37:51.60,00:37:51.60,maybe the merge was goingto be today.
915,00:37:53.80,00:37:53.80,Looks likeit's just another day
916,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,and we're going tohave to wait it out
917,00:37:56.90,00:37:56.90,and see what happens.
918,00:38:02.70,00:38:02.70,"- Oh, my."

925,00:38:28.80,00:38:28.80,- But there was stillno mention of a merge.
926,00:38:33.63,00:38:33.63,"When the tribes arrivedfor the challenge,"
927,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,they finally got thenews they were waiting for.
928,00:38:38.93,00:38:38.93,The ten of you have nowmerged into one tribe.
929,00:38:43.80,00:38:43.80,- Congratulations.

934,00:38:56.50,00:38:56.50,"Drop an arm,and lose immunity."
935,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,- Oh!
936,00:39:13.13,00:39:13.13,- Clarence and Teresaoutlasted all the rest.
937,00:39:16.63,00:39:16.63,"Feeling he was vulnerable,"
938,00:39:18.13,00:39:18.13,Clarence tried to bargainhis way to immunity.
939,00:39:22.33,00:39:22.33,- Let's compromise.
940,00:39:23.80,00:39:23.80,They want me gone.
941,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,- You're trying to trick meand I don't like it.
942,00:39:29.07,00:39:29.07,"- After more thansix hours,"
943,00:39:30.77,00:39:30.77,"it came down to a simplegame of rock, paper, scissors."
944,00:39:35.17,00:39:35.17,- Paper covers rock.
945,00:39:38.13,00:39:38.13,- Teresa took possessionof the immunity necklace
946,00:39:41.80,00:39:41.80,and promised Clarenceshe wouldn't vote for him

963,00:40:27.23,00:40:27.23,It's still daylight--we got time to go get wood.
964,00:40:29.40,00:40:29.40,- Let's get wood.- Let's get wood.

970,00:40:45.40,00:40:45.40,"and wagging his tailand looking over,"
971,00:40:48.87,00:40:48.87,"and I don't know,at times, it seemed like"
972,00:40:51.07,00:40:51.07,"he might've acknowledged,"
973,00:40:52.13,00:40:52.13,"stopped and looked over,you know?"

978,00:41:14.67,00:41:14.67,But the others saw him
979,00:41:16.30,00:41:16.30,as too much of a physicalthreat to keep around.
980,00:41:19.10,00:41:19.10,"Clarence,the tribe has spoken."
981,00:41:25.67,00:41:25.67,But Lex walked away withtwo votes against him.
