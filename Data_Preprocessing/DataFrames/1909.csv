475,00:28:26.92,00:28:26.92,"I think you always have to havea plan B, and I said in the"
476,00:28:31.04,00:28:31.04,"off chance that she did getimmunity today, that we'd vote"
477,00:28:34.42,00:28:34.42,Kel 'cause Kelly's strongerthan Monica.
478,00:28:36.96,00:28:36.96,Monica's no threat whatsoever.So eliminate somebody that's
479,00:28:40.21,00:28:40.21,"close to Laura, cause a littledissension amongst the ranks."
480,00:28:44.25,00:28:44.25,That's the plan of attack.>> I found another
481,00:28:51.92,00:28:51.92,immunity idol.>> Bull ...
482,00:28:53.83,00:28:53.83,Where'd you find it?>> At the bridge.
483,00:28:58.08,00:28:58.08,">> Nicely done, my man.You deserve this, man."
484,00:29:02.92,00:29:02.92,"You deserve this, for real.>> Dude..."

486,00:29:07.29,00:29:07.29,"Hopefully, they trying to voteme out."
487,00:29:10.62,00:29:10.62,"So trust me, just vote Kelly.Everything else is fine."
488,00:29:14.67,00:29:14.67,>> So Russell found anotheridol that the Galu members don't
489,00:29:17.67,00:29:17.67,"know about.And, uh, the idea is to"
490,00:29:21.58,00:29:21.58,"surprise them with it.It's a gamble, baby."
491,00:29:24.71,00:29:24.71,">> It's a gamble.>> All right, I'm with you."
492,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,"If Galu gets wind of what'sgoing on, they're gonna change"
493,00:29:30.67,00:29:30.67,their vote and they'll takesomebody on Foa Foa out that's
494,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,"not Russell, and it's all awaste."
495,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,So it's gotta to be Russelltonight or we're all through.
496,00:29:42.75,00:29:42.75,>> There's an immunity idol.So the idea is to focus all
497,00:29:45.79,00:29:45.79,the attention on Russell...>> He found another one?
498,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,>> He found another.It's under the bridge.
499,00:29:56.50,00:29:56.50,Hi. What's going on?>> So Russell found the idol.
500,00:30:08.12,00:30:08.12,It's unbelievable how he findsthese things.
501,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,"And so quickly, too.He just has a keen mind for it,"
502,00:30:13.12,00:30:13.12,you know?>> I'm really beginning to love
503,00:30:16.33,00:30:16.33,that guy.I'm really beginning
504,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,to love him.>> He's good at this thing.
505,00:30:21.04,00:30:21.04,I didn't know there would be asecond one.
506,00:30:23.21,00:30:23.21,So I'm excited to see whathappens tonight at
507,00:30:25.21,00:30:25.21,Tribal Council.We all hope to put a dent in
508,00:30:27.96,00:30:27.96,Galu today and put a big dent inthat arrogance and
509,00:30:30.58,00:30:30.58,condescending patronizingattitude they have towards us.
510,00:30:34.38,00:30:34.38,">> So remind me-- Russell,Natalie, Mick, Jaison, right?"
511,00:30:38.04,00:30:38.04,>> Should we plan for just incase that one of them may find
512,00:30:41.83,00:30:41.83,an idol?Because if we all vote for
513,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,"Russell, and then say Russellhas the idol again, at that"
514,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,"point the other person goeshome, and it's one of us."
515,00:30:51.12,00:30:51.12,">> That... All right, listen.We can't worry about that"
516,00:30:53.71,00:30:53.71,right now.Now's not the time for that.
517,00:30:55.92,00:30:55.92,"Like, they don't know anythingabout it."
518,00:30:57.33,00:30:57.33,>> I can tell you if it were meand I was on Foa Foa and I were
519,00:31:00.96,00:31:00.96,over here...>> I'd be looking for the idol.
520,00:31:02.96,00:31:02.96,>> I would assume thatit was here.
521,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,">> Mm-hmm.>> I mean, that's not rocket"
522,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,science.>> Which means they found it
523,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"just by digging in tree stumps,though."
524,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83,>> He found a fricking idolwithout a fricking clue.
525,00:31:12.62,00:31:12.62,">> Here's, here's the thingthat..."
526,00:31:14.00,00:31:14.00,"Here's what I, here's all...No, no, no, no."
527,00:31:15.58,00:31:15.58,"That's what makes me nervous,right?"
528,00:31:17.12,00:31:17.12, >> I don't think he has it.I don't think he even...
529,00:31:19.83,00:31:19.83,"If he suspects there's onehere, I'd be surprised."
530,00:31:25.00,00:31:25.00,"First vote-- Russ, second voteNatalie, bang..."
531,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,"or vice versa.We can go Natalie first, we can"
532,00:31:30.96,00:31:30.96,go Russ second.>> I say Russ first.
533,00:31:32.62,00:31:32.62,I say Russ.>> I don't know.
534,00:31:43.12,00:31:43.12,>> I think I heard that theywere gonna vote Natalie.
535,00:31:45.71,00:31:45.71,"I don't know that, but I heardthem say her name."
536,00:31:49.42,00:31:49.42,That's how this game goes.It messes with your mind.
537,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,I think they made their mindup; I think it might be Natalie.
538,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,>> You think it's Natalie?Why do you think that?
539,00:31:59.54,00:31:59.54,>> I don't know. (laughs)>> You got few hours
540,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,to try and sway it to make sure.>> I don't know if I should
541,00:32:09.96,00:32:09.96,play it or not.I'm confused on what to do.
542,00:32:14.21,00:32:14.21,I don't want to be the dumbassthat gets voted out with the
543,00:32:17.46,00:32:17.46,"idol in his pocket, and I don'twant to be the dumbass that"
544,00:32:20.71,00:32:20.71,"uses the idol again, and thennobody votes my name."
545,00:32:24.08,00:32:24.08,"So now, I don't know what to dowith it."
546,00:32:29.33,00:32:29.33,">> And as soon as we burn allthe Foa Foas, kill a chicken."
547,00:32:32.88,00:32:32.88,">> Yeah!>> It's our Galu chicken,"
548,00:32:34.62,00:32:34.62,"it's not theirs.>> Yeah, it's not theirs."
549,00:32:36.29,00:32:36.29,>> We're making it pure Galuall the way.
550,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,>> I'm not sharing with anybodythat ain't purple.
551,00:32:40.92,00:32:40.92,">> That's right.Right now, I think we're tight."
552,00:32:42.96,00:32:42.96,"The Galu tribe is tight.We don't trust Sham, but we are"
553,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,still definitely six strong.As long as we can get the Foa
554,00:32:50.00,00:32:50.00,"Foa out, and then we have sevenof the Galu left, that's what"
555,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,we want.>> I like that.
556,00:32:55.21,00:32:55.21,I'm there.>> PROBST: I'll now bring in
557,00:33:23.54,00:33:23.54,the first member of our jury.Erik voted out at the last
558,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,"Tribal Council.So, Dave, coming into last"
559,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,"Tribal, Galu had the numbers,eight to four."
560,00:33:42.12,00:33:42.12,You voted out one of your ownin Erik.
561,00:33:44.92,00:33:44.92,Is that a sign that old triballines are gone and this now is
562,00:33:48.29,00:33:48.29,"an individual game?>> Not at all, Jeff."
563,00:33:51.25,00:33:51.25,"To be honest, our tribe wasweakened from within by Erik's"
564,00:33:55.42,00:33:55.42,presence.And it was actually a
565,00:33:58.62,00:33:58.62,strengthening of our tribalunity.
566,00:34:01.54,00:34:01.54,">> PROBST: Kelly, how did youfeel about last tribal's vote?"
567,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,">> I think there was thisuneasiness in the tribe, almost"
568,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,like a snake kind of starting alot of trouble and it seemed to
569,00:34:11.83,00:34:11.83,"all come back to Erik.So when it comes down to it,"
570,00:34:14.42,00:34:14.42,you have to go with who youtrust.
571,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,">> PROBST: Natalie, what's itlike at camp?"
572,00:34:19.04,00:34:19.04,"The old Galu tribe is still incharge, in terms of numbers,"
573,00:34:23.25,00:34:23.25,and it's their camp.>> I think they're trying to
574,00:34:25.92,00:34:25.92,"make us still feel welcome,like we're all one."
575,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,>> PROBST: How could theypossibly make you feel like
576,00:34:32.96,00:34:32.96,"you're all still one?>> You know, I've been welcomed"
577,00:34:34.92,00:34:34.92,"into the shelter, I sleep withthem."
578,00:34:36.58,00:34:36.58,">> PROBST: But Natalie, you'renot all still one."
579,00:34:38.58,00:34:38.58,">> You're right.But they're not, like, being"
580,00:34:40.79,00:34:40.79,mean or ugly to anybody.I guess that's more or less
581,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,"what I was trying to say.But the fact of the matter is,"
582,00:34:46.42,00:34:46.42,it is seven to four and they aretight.
583,00:34:49.62,00:34:49.62,">> PROBST: Jaison, what does itsay to the Foa Foa foursome"
584,00:34:52.50,00:34:52.50,that Galu was willing to getrid of one of their own?
585,00:34:55.04,00:34:55.04,>> They're very tight-lippedabout what's going on over
586,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"there, so it's hard to figureout if there is a crack or not."
587,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,You never know what can happen.Maybe there's another Erik out
588,00:35:04.42,00:35:04.42,there that hasn't been exposedyet.
589,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,So I'm just trying to hold onto some hope.
590,00:35:09.38,00:35:09.38,">> PROBST: Shambo, tell me thestate of the game right now,"
591,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,from where you sit.>> It feels like the original
592,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,"Galu is pretty comfortable, andthe Foa Foa is kind of holding"
593,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,"on.>> PROBST: So, Mick, if old"
594,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,"tribal lines are holdingstrong, your only chance is to"
595,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,"keep chipping away.Otherwise, your days are"
596,00:35:29.71,00:35:29.71,"numbered.>> Yeah, absolutely."
597,00:35:32.04,00:35:32.04,"I mean, we know that, thenumbers are obvious."
598,00:35:34.00,00:35:34.00,"But we still hope somebody willsee past the former Galu,"
599,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,"former Foa Foa, and just seefour solid votes and be like ""I"
600,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,"need to make a big move here."">> PROBST: Russell, so do you"
601,00:35:43.88,00:35:43.88,"spend most of your dayobserving the Galu seven,"
602,00:35:47.79,00:35:47.79,"trying to figure out-- maybethere's a crack here, maybe I"
603,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,"can get in over here?>> Well, yeah, I did."
604,00:35:53.96,00:35:53.96,"But now, you know, it's gettingto where we're hoping that"
605,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,somebody comes to us.Talks to us and wants to do
606,00:35:59.62,00:35:59.62,something.But they seem to be pretty
607,00:36:02.75,00:36:02.75,"tight.>> PROBST: Monica, do you see"
608,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,"Foa Foa people going up to yourtribe mates, trying to see if"
609,00:36:09.04,00:36:09.04,they can start some drama?>> I think the Foa Foa see how
610,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,"strong the seven of us are, atthis point."
611,00:36:16.12,00:36:16.12,"If they are giving it a try, Igive them respect for doing so,"
612,00:36:19.21,00:36:19.21,but I don't think it's thathard of a try that they're
613,00:36:21.46,00:36:21.46,giving.>> PROBST: So at this point in
614,00:36:23.92,00:36:23.92,"the game, Dave, how do youdecide who's next?"
615,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,>> I think you just have toassess who's the most
616,00:36:29.08,00:36:29.08,"dangerous, and there areseveral different criteria, not"
617,00:36:32.71,00:36:32.71,"the least of which is physicalability, mental toughness,"
618,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,"strategic acumen.And it's a communal decision,"
619,00:36:42.42,00:36:42.42,you know?We try to come to a consensus
620,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,so that everybody feels heardand everybody feels that their
621,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,"needs are being met.>> PROBST: All right, let's get"
622,00:36:53.12,00:36:53.12,"to the vote.Laura, once again, you have the"
623,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,"immunity necklace, keeping itfor yourself?"
624,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,>> Yes.>> PROBST: You can not vote for
625,00:37:00.75,00:37:00.75,Laura.Anybody else is fair game.
626,00:37:03.08,00:37:03.08,"It is time to vote.Brett, you're up."
627,00:37:53.88,00:37:53.88,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
628,00:38:12.79,00:38:12.79,If anybody has a hiddenimmunity idol and you want to
629,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,"play it, now would be the timeto do so."
630,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,>> I ain't finished playingjust yet.
631,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,Keep hope alive.>> PROBST: The rules of
632,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,Survivor state that ifsomeone plays a hidden immunity
633,00:38:46.58,00:38:46.58,"idol, then any votes castagainst that person will not"
634,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,count and the person with thenext-highest number of votes
635,00:38:52.92,00:38:52.92,will be sent home.This is an idol.
636,00:38:55.92,00:38:55.92,Any votes cast against Russellwill not count.

655,00:41:07.17,00:41:07.17,"Well, since the merge, therehave been two Tribal Councils,"
656,00:41:10.17,00:41:10.17,"two blind sides, two hiddenimmunity idols played and, once"
657,00:41:13.21,00:41:13.21,"again, the Foa Foa foursomehave survived the vote."
658,00:41:16.25,00:41:16.25,"The question is, will tonight'svote change the game or merely"
659,00:41:17.75,00:41:17.75,delay the inevitable?One more thing: the hidden
660,00:41:21.38,00:41:21.38,immunity idol goes back intothe game once again.

670,00:42:02.12,00:42:02.12,>> We need to keep that hidden
671,00:42:03.79,00:42:03.79,immunity idol out of Russell'shands.

673,00:42:12.42,00:42:12.42,home tonight.Everything was working out
674,00:42:14.25,00:42:14.25,perfectly and I hope Galu getsrid of Russell.
675,00:42:16.96,00:42:16.96,It's too many idols.How many can there be.
676,00:42:19.46,00:42:19.46,He's just a little sneaky manand I definitely know that he's
677,00:42:21.42,00:42:21.42,next on the line.Foa Foa stepped in and totallyI think took us all by surprise.
678,00:42:23.25,00:42:23.25,I don't know if anyone from mytribe was involved but I'm
679,00:42:25.00,00:42:25.00,totally shocked.
