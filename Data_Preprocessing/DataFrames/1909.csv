4,00:00:10.25,00:00:10.25,comfortable eight-four advantage over the old Foa Foa.
5,00:00:13.21,00:00:13.21,">> The plan for Foa Foa is to shoot them down-- pop, pop,"
6,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,"pop, pop. >> PROBST: But while the old"
7,00:00:18.29,00:00:18.29,Galu was basking in the glow of victory...
8,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,>> No. >> PROBST: ...they were blind to
9,00:00:28.21,00:00:28.21,the fact that Shambo felt ostracized by Laura and embraced
10,00:00:30.79,00:00:30.79,"by Russell. >> Shambo hates Laura, so I know"
11,00:00:33.79,00:00:33.79,"at any point, she'll vote Laura's name."
12,00:00:36.92,00:00:36.92,>> PROBST: They also didn't realize that Natalie was working
13,00:00:38.96,00:00:38.96,the Galu women to take out a Galu man.
14,00:00:41.75,00:00:41.75,">> I don't trust Erik. >> All of a sudden, all the"
15,00:00:46.71,00:00:46.71,"girls want to vote Erik out, but they could possibly be saying,"
16,00:00:50.04,00:00:50.04,"""Let's say vote Erik,"" and then they get me and the idol."
17,00:00:54.96,00:00:54.96,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, both Russell and Erik showed up"
18,00:00:58.08,00:00:58.08,with hidden immunity idols. Erik's idol stayed in his
19,00:01:01.25,00:01:01.25,pocket because he was sure that he wasn't in danger.
20,00:01:04.12,00:01:04.12,>> I would be floored if I saw them get one Galu member to
21,00:01:07.62,00:01:07.62,turn. >> PROBST: Russell was sure that
22,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,"he was in danger, so he played his idol."
23,00:01:12.54,00:01:12.54,Any votes cast for Russell tonight will not count.
24,00:01:16.25,00:01:16.25,But he didn't need to because Natalie's plan worked.
25,00:01:19.38,00:01:19.38,Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Samoa and the first
26,00:01:22.12,00:01:22.12,"member of our jury-- Erik. Thanks to Natalie, the old Galu"
27,00:01:25.50,00:01:25.50,blindsided one of their own. The tribe has spoken.
28,00:01:29.96,00:01:29.96,"Although the Foa Foa four have lived to see another day, their"
29,00:01:33.04,00:01:33.04,battle is far from over. 11 are left.
30,00:01:37.29,00:01:37.29,Who will be voted out tonight? (crickets chirping)
31,00:01:55.21,00:01:55.21,>> I'd just like a chocolate chip cookie...
32,00:01:57.25,00:01:57.25,">> Uh-huh. >> ...with, like, one-inch thick"
33,00:01:59.25,00:01:59.25,of peanut butter on it. >> Ooh.
34,00:02:04.46,00:02:04.46,">> Thanks, Shambo. >> At Tribal today, I had a"
35,00:02:07.38,00:02:07.38,"strong feeling it would be me. Uh, I didn't even think twice"
36,00:02:11.17,00:02:11.17,"about playing the idol. But I'm really worried, because"
37,00:02:14.17,00:02:14.17,I'm pretty sure I'm out next. I'm gone.
38,00:02:20.17,00:02:20.17,">> So, I'm hoping for a miracle, because I'm in deep trouble"
39,00:02:23.33,00:02:23.33,right now. >> That was perfect.
40,00:02:27.08,00:02:27.08,>> Yeah. >> That could not have been
41,00:02:29.12,00:02:29.12,"better, girls. >> Well, because..."
42,00:02:33.83,00:02:33.83,">> Well, no, because... >> I wanted..."
43,00:02:35.83,00:02:35.83,We needed to make him nervous. I think it was the dumbest move
44,00:02:38.58,00:02:38.58,"that Russell could have made, playing that idol tonight."
45,00:02:40.67,00:02:40.67,"When he stood up and he used it, I about came off my stool."
46,00:02:44.25,00:02:44.25,"It could not have happened any better for us, because not only"
47,00:02:48.00,00:02:48.00,"did we get rid of Erik, we just flushed out that idol and then"
48,00:02:51.25,00:02:51.25,exposed who's going to be coming up next.
49,00:02:53.62,00:02:53.62,It could not have happened any better.
50,00:02:56.04,00:02:56.04,Russell should absolutely be nervous.
51,00:02:58.38,00:02:58.38,Russell is going to be gone next.

53,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,>> I have no idea how to do this.
54,00:04:10.04,00:04:10.04,"Well, I kind of went out for a walk, and I stumble upon this"
55,00:04:12.58,00:04:12.58,rat or this mouse. I'm so scared.
56,00:04:15.33,00:04:15.33,"Oh, my gosh! A rock or a stick?"
57,00:04:18.25,00:04:18.25,A rock or a stick? I really ca...
58,00:04:21.04,00:04:21.04,"Oh, my gosh! I'm, like, oh, my goodness,"
59,00:04:23.58,00:04:23.58,"that's, like, something to eat. I was just thinking, I'm"
60,00:04:25.96,00:04:25.96,starving. I never thought I'd be this
61,00:04:28.25,00:04:28.25,"hungry in my life. Oh, gosh."
62,00:04:31.12,00:04:31.12,"Okay, just turn around, eat your... eat your snack."
63,00:04:34.54,00:04:34.54,Eat your snack. Eat your snack.
64,00:04:36.58,00:04:36.58,"Eat your snack, buddy. Oh, gosh. Oh, my word."
65,00:04:39.25,00:04:39.25,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is pitiful."
66,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,"Oh, my gosh. Oh, Lord, have mercy."
67,00:04:45.17,00:04:45.17,"Oh, my word. Okay."
68,00:04:47.33,00:04:47.33,"Finally, I just hit the rat. It was really hard for me 'cause"
69,00:04:51.79,00:04:51.79,"he was looking at me. He was cute, but I knew how..."
70,00:04:54.46,00:04:54.46,I'm starving. I've never been this hungry in
71,00:04:57.21,00:04:57.21,my entire life. I feel like I'm just fading
72,00:04:59.29,00:04:59.29,"away. Um, I have something to show"
73,00:05:01.71,00:05:01.71,y'all. >> What do you got?
74,00:05:03.71,00:05:03.71,">> Yeah? >> I killed something, y'all."
75,00:05:06.00,00:05:06.00,>> What'd you kill? >> A rat.
76,00:05:08.04,00:05:08.04,">> What...? >> I swear, y'all, I swear."
77,00:05:11.08,00:05:11.08,It's right here. >> What? Ew!
78,00:05:13.12,00:05:13.12,">> I know, it's disgusting. Would you have done it?"
79,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,>> How did you kill a rat? >> With a stick.
80,00:05:17.46,00:05:17.46,It was scary. I didn't know what I was doing.
81,00:05:20.46,00:05:20.46,Russell! >> What?
82,00:05:22.46,00:05:22.46,">> Natalie walks into camp with this rat in a coconut, and we're"
83,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,all just shocked. >> Did you catch that?
84,00:05:27.04,00:05:27.04,">> Get it? Got it? >> Well, I killed it."
85,00:05:29.04,00:05:29.04,I hit it with a stick and then the rock. I just don't know...
86,00:05:31.42,00:05:31.42,>> Are you serious? >> Yeah.
87,00:05:33.04,00:05:33.04,">> She came into this game the Southern belle, you know, very"
88,00:05:35.71,00:05:35.71,"sweet, nice girl, but definitely not the rough-and-tumble"
89,00:05:38.25,00:05:38.25,Survivor type. She wasn't a Shambo.
90,00:05:41.12,00:05:41.12,So when she came back in her little bikini with a rat in the
91,00:05:43.38,00:05:43.38,"coconut, we were all shocked to death."
92,00:05:45.58,00:05:45.58,">> Beef jerky. >> Oh, that's so good."
93,00:05:47.58,00:05:47.58,>> It kind of just tastes like chicken.
94,00:05:49.67,00:05:49.67,">> On so many levels, I'm proud of Natalie out here."
95,00:05:51.71,00:05:51.71,"You know, from what I knew about her coming in to where she is"
96,00:05:53.83,00:05:53.83,"now, I think she's changed a lot over the last 23 days, and I'm"
97,00:05:57.12,00:05:57.12,really happy for her. >> You're a rock star hunter and
98,00:05:59.12,00:05:59.12,"gatherer. >> Oh, thanks!"
99,00:06:01.25,00:06:01.25,">> You believe, girl. >> Oh, we got a little tree"
100,00:06:05.42,00:06:05.42,"mail. >> Oh, yeah."
101,00:06:07.46,00:06:07.46,>> Isn't that nice? >> What else is in here?
102,00:06:09.46,00:06:09.46,Nothing. (laughter)
103,00:06:14.21,00:06:14.21,">> I found the other idol, everybody."
104,00:06:16.25,00:06:16.25,>> Yeah. If there's another immunity idol
105,00:06:18.58,00:06:18.58,"that gets put into play, I'm going to find it, because I'm"
106,00:06:20.71,00:06:20.71,probably gone next time. So I have to believe there's
107,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,one here. >> Tree mail!
108,00:06:25.38,00:06:25.38,">> Tree mail! >> ""And now for something"
109,00:06:27.58,00:06:27.58,completely different. A challenge with a digital
110,00:06:29.62,00:06:29.62,display! You'll work together with a
111,00:06:31.54,00:06:31.54,"bunch of nuts, to win a feast and a getaway!"""
112,00:06:33.83,00:06:33.83,>> Oh! >> The second immunity idol-- I
113,00:06:37.54,00:06:37.54,"think it's in the camp right now, and I think I'm going to"
114,00:06:41.00,00:06:41.00,find it today. But we've got a reward challenge
115,00:06:43.71,00:06:43.71,"coming up, so right now, I don't have time, but I'm working on"
116,00:06:47.25,00:06:47.25,"it. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
117,00:07:03.29,00:07:03.29,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
118,00:07:05.58,00:07:05.58,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, absolutely."
119,00:07:07.58,00:07:07.58,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, you will divide into"
120,00:07:09.83,00:07:09.83,"two teams of five. On my go, you will race two at"
121,00:07:13.50,00:07:13.50,a time out into a field to collect a series of poles
122,00:07:16.79,00:07:16.79,threaded with white and black coconuts.
123,00:07:19.96,00:07:19.96,"Once you've retrieved the poles, arrange them so that the white"
124,00:07:23.25,00:07:23.25,coconuts form a four-digit number.
125,00:07:27.00,00:07:27.00,"Each team's number is different, so you're not going to be able"
126,00:07:29.58,00:07:29.58,"to cheat. Once you have the number, I'll"
127,00:07:32.04,00:07:32.04,"blindfold a tribe member. Using only their sense of touch,"
128,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,they must find the same number on a combination lock.
129,00:07:39.25,00:07:39.25,The first team to solve their combination lock and raise their
130,00:07:42.08,00:07:42.08,flag wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
131,00:07:44.08,00:07:44.08,"for? >> Yes, sir."
132,00:07:46.12,00:07:46.12,>> Yes. >> PROBST: The winning team will
133,00:07:48.17,00:07:48.17,be taken directly from here to a one-of-a-kind massive rock
134,00:07:51.21,00:07:51.21,slide. This is a natural rock slide
135,00:07:54.92,00:07:54.92,that you literally slide down the rocks into beautiful fresh
136,00:07:57.00,00:07:57.00,water. >> Wow.
137,00:07:59.00,00:07:59.00,>> PROBST: You'll also enjoy a nice picnic lunch.
138,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Fried chicken."
139,00:08:04.08,00:08:04.08,>> Oh. >> PROBST: Chocolate brownies.
140,00:08:06.08,00:08:06.08,">> Oh... >> Oh, no!"
141,00:08:08.08,00:08:08.08,>> Chocolate. >> PROBST: Worth playing for?
142,00:08:10.12,00:08:10.12,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Okay, we're going to"
143,00:08:12.12,00:08:12.12,"have a random draw for our teams, and because there are 11"
144,00:08:14.33,00:08:14.33,"of you, that means one person will not participate in this"
145,00:08:17.50,00:08:17.50,"challenge. All right, we've chosen our"
146,00:08:22.96,00:08:22.96,"teams. Jaison, Laura, Brett, Mick and"
147,00:08:26.96,00:08:26.96,Russell-- that's our yellow team.
148,00:08:29.42,00:08:29.42,"Shambo, Kelly, Dave, John and Monica are the purple team."
149,00:08:33.42,00:08:33.42,"That leaves you, Natalie, as the odd one out."
150,00:08:36.04,00:08:36.04,Here's the twist for you. You will not participate in the
151,00:08:39.75,00:08:39.75,challenge. What you're going to do instead
152,00:08:42.04,00:08:42.04,is choose one team to support. If you choose the team that goes
153,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,"on to win, you go on reward with them."
154,00:08:50.54,00:08:50.54,"If you choose the team that ends up losing, you go back with them"
155,00:08:53.58,00:08:53.58,to camp empty-handed. Big decision.
156,00:08:57.12,00:08:57.12,Look at the two teams. Who do you think has the best
157,00:08:59.46,00:08:59.46,shot of winning? >> They look like a pretty
158,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,"good... a pretty good match. I guess I will go with Brett,"
159,00:09:07.67,00:09:07.67,"Laura, Mick, Russ and Jaison. >> PROBST: Natalie, going to"
160,00:09:10.50,00:09:10.50,"support the yellow team. Natalie, you'll take a spot on"
161,00:09:12.79,00:09:12.79,"the bench. Everybody else, give you a"
162,00:09:14.83,00:09:14.83,"minute to strategize, we'll get started."
163,00:09:18.96,00:09:18.96,"All right, you're going out two at a time."
164,00:09:21.88,00:09:21.88,Survivors ready? Go!
165,00:09:26.17,00:09:26.17,"Mick and Brett, John and Kelly. >> Come on, guys!"

167,00:09:32.38,00:09:32.38,untied! >> Got it. Got it.

171,00:09:44.83,00:09:44.83,">> Hey, guys. >> PROBST: Dave and Shambo"
172,00:09:46.83,00:09:46.83,heading out for purple. Russell and Jaison now heading
173,00:09:49.25,00:09:49.25,"out for yellow. >> Let's go, Jaison and Russell!"
174,00:09:51.04,00:09:51.04,>> Got it? >> I-I got it.
175,00:09:53.71,00:09:53.71,>> Come on. >> PROBST: Jaison and Russell
176,00:09:55.71,00:09:55.71,quickly heading back. Dave and Shambo heading back.
177,00:10:00.42,00:10:00.42,"Go, yellow! >> Go, go, go, go!"
178,00:10:03.12,00:10:03.12,>> PROBST: Brett and Mick out on the course for yellow.
179,00:10:05.79,00:10:05.79,Yellow's now in the lead. >> Go!
180,00:10:08.42,00:10:08.42,>> PROBST: Kelly and John back out on the course for purple.
181,00:10:12.50,00:10:12.50,Mick and Brett rip through those knots.
182,00:10:14.71,00:10:14.71,"John and Kelly making fast work of it, trying to make up some"
183,00:10:17.75,00:10:17.75,time. >> Move! Move! Move! Move!
184,00:10:19.75,00:10:19.75,">> Come on, guys! Come on!"
185,00:10:22.83,00:10:22.83,>> PROBST: John and Kelly closing the gap.
186,00:10:25.04,00:10:25.04,"We are neck and neck! >> Yeah, come on."
187,00:10:27.08,00:10:27.08,>> PROBST: Russell and Jaison back out on the course.
188,00:10:29.54,00:10:29.54,They are going for their last pole.
189,00:10:31.83,00:10:31.83,Dave and Shambo. Shambo really slowing purple

191,00:10:35.83,00:10:35.83,"Come on, Sham! >> PROBST: That gives yellow a"
192,00:10:38.75,00:10:38.75,"lot of advantage. >> Let's go Jaison, Russell!"
193,00:10:40.75,00:10:40.75,You guys got it. >> PROBST: Jaison and Russell
194,00:10:42.75,00:10:42.75,heading back with that final pole.
195,00:10:44.75,00:10:44.75,">> Go, go, go! >> Let's go guys!"
196,00:10:46.75,00:10:46.75,>> PROBST: They've all made quick work of the knots for
197,00:10:48.75,00:10:48.75,purple. Yellow still in the lead.
198,00:10:50.75,00:10:50.75,">> Got it! Got it! Push it! >> Run, Shambo, run!"
199,00:10:52.75,00:10:52.75,>> PROBST: Dave and Shambo heading back with that final
200,00:10:54.75,00:10:54.75,"pole for purple. Start working on it, yellow."
201,00:10:56.75,00:10:56.75,">> Good job, guys. Let's go yellow."
202,00:10:58.75,00:10:58.75,Study it good. >> Let's go! Let's go!
203,00:11:02.58,00:11:02.58,">> PROBST: Go, purple. >> Put them up, put them up."
204,00:11:04.88,00:11:04.88,"Dave and Shambo, put them up. >> PROBST: You are now looking"
205,00:11:06.83,00:11:06.83,to form a four-digit number using the white coconuts.
206,00:11:11.17,00:11:11.17,">> Put this one at the very top. >> Oh, my God."
207,00:11:13.04,00:11:13.04,">> We both take this one, we have a three."
208,00:11:14.79,00:11:14.79,">> Just grab it. >> Good job, guys, come on,"
209,00:11:16.08,00:11:16.08,"guys. Hustle, stick with it, you can"
210,00:11:18.25,00:11:18.25,do it. >> Three.
211,00:11:19.83,00:11:19.83,">> Put this one in the middle. >> Come on, champ."
212,00:11:21.88,00:11:21.88,>> Six. >> One.
213,00:11:24.79,00:11:24.79,">> That's not a three, that's not a three."
214,00:11:26.42,00:11:26.42,>> This is a four. >> It could be a three.
215,00:11:27.96,00:11:27.96,>> This one-- the top one needs to rotate.
216,00:11:29.46,00:11:29.46,"Watch out, guys. >> That makes it a four."
217,00:11:31.92,00:11:31.92,"All right. Drop this, Shambo."
218,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,"Shambo, grab this. >> PROBST: Dave has an idea."
219,00:11:35.04,00:11:35.04,"Barking out orders now. >> Good girl, good girl."
220,00:11:36.96,00:11:36.96,That's the girl. >> What if we rotate this middle
221,00:11:38.46,00:11:38.46,"one, that turns this into a six? Let's rotate this one."
222,00:11:40.12,00:11:40.12,">> Rotate this one? >> Okay, this one."
223,00:11:41.54,00:11:41.54,">> Come on, hustle, hustle, hustle."
224,00:11:43.12,00:11:43.12,">> That's a three, that's a seven."
225,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,No. We need a six.
226,00:11:46.71,00:11:46.71,"We got it, we got it. Four, six, seven, three."
227,00:11:49.50,00:11:49.50,Monica! >> Yes!
228,00:11:51.50,00:11:51.50,">> Four, six, seven, three. >> Okay."
229,00:11:54.50,00:11:54.50,">> PROBST: Purple has their number, they've passed it on to"
230,00:11:56.92,00:11:56.92,Monica. Each team's number is different.
231,00:12:00.79,00:12:00.79,That means yellow can't cheat off purple.
232,00:12:03.17,00:12:03.17,Yellow still looking for those four digits.
233,00:12:05.17,00:12:05.17,">> You got tons of time, Monica, relax."
234,00:12:07.08,00:12:07.08,>> Okay. >> PROBST: Monica now working on
235,00:12:09.04,00:12:09.04,the puzzle for purple. She must now find the same four
236,00:12:12.38,00:12:12.38,"numbers her teammates found below while blindfolded, using"
237,00:12:16.92,00:12:16.92,"only her fingers. >> Please, dear God."
238,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,">> There's a three, there's a four, there's a six."
239,00:12:22.00,00:12:22.00,"There's a seven. Seven, three, four, six."
240,00:12:23.75,00:12:23.75,">> Okay, got it. Come on."
241,00:12:25.17,00:12:25.17,">> Hurry, hurry, tell him. >> Seven, three, four, six."
242,00:12:28.29,00:12:28.29,>> PROBST: Laura now working on the puzzle for yellow.
243,00:12:31.96,00:12:31.96,">> Come on, Moni. >> PROBST: Monica had a nice"
244,00:12:34.21,00:12:34.21,head start. Can she keep the lead?
245,00:12:36.83,00:12:36.83,">> Keep going, Monica. >> PROBST: Laura not panicking."
246,00:12:40.12,00:12:40.12,">> Keep working, keep working. >> Laura, seven, three, four,"
247,00:12:41.79,00:12:41.79,six. >> PROBST: Now it's a matter of
248,00:12:43.67,00:12:43.67,"who is going to finish first. >> No, no, no."
249,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,>> PROBST: Monica thinks she has it.
250,00:12:47.12,00:12:47.12,">> Four, six, seven, three, Moni."
251,00:12:48.92,00:12:48.92,>> PROBST: It is wrong. Keep working.
252,00:12:51.21,00:12:51.21,>> Keep going. >> They're not done.
253,00:12:53.04,00:12:53.04,">> Seven, three, four, six. >> PROBST: Monica has it right."
254,00:12:56.08,00:12:56.08,Purple wins reward! (cheers and applause)
255,00:13:00.25,00:13:00.25,">> Right on. Good job, Moni."
256,00:13:02.88,00:13:02.88,">> You rock, little sister. >> Thank you."
257,00:13:05.83,00:13:05.83,>> Good job. Nice.
258,00:13:08.25,00:13:08.25,Nice. >> That's a girl.
259,00:13:10.54,00:13:10.54,"Good girl. >> PROBST: Natalie, you can join"
260,00:13:13.17,00:13:13.17,"yellow. Natalie, Russell, Mick, Brett,"
261,00:13:17.38,00:13:17.38,"Jaison, Laura, got nothing for you."
262,00:13:20.12,00:13:20.12,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
263,00:13:22.04,00:13:22.04,">> Enjoy. >> Thanks, man, good job."
264,00:13:24.29,00:13:24.29,"You guys were tough. >> PROBST: Dave, Shambo, Kelly,"
265,00:13:26.96,00:13:26.96,"John, Monica, congratulations. You will leave from here and be"
266,00:13:30.46,00:13:30.46,"taken to a beautiful spot. Grab your stuff, head out."
267,00:13:34.04,00:13:34.04,Have a good afternoon. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
268,00:14:08.25,00:14:08.25,(John laughs) >> Today's reward is awesome.
269,00:14:12.25,00:14:12.25,The rock slides are killer. >> Careful.
270,00:14:15.50,00:14:15.50,How high is that? (Monica screaming)
271,00:14:22.12,00:14:22.12,(laughter) >> Whoa.
272,00:14:25.21,00:14:25.21,>> The slides are big and fast and fun.
273,00:14:27.67,00:14:27.67,The pools are cool. It's kind of what I've been
274,00:14:32.21,00:14:32.21,looking forward to for a while-- just a day of relaxation.
275,00:14:36.92,00:14:36.92,">> I'm, like, so terrified of water slides."
276,00:14:40.62,00:14:40.62,"(Kelly screaming) It was so fun just, like, going"
277,00:14:45.21,00:14:45.21,"down. It's fresh water and it's clean,"
278,00:14:47.54,00:14:47.54,"it's clear, and... (Kelly and Monica screaming)"
279,00:14:51.46,00:14:51.46,...it's just been beautiful here.
280,00:14:53.46,00:14:53.46,>> Mmm. Cheers.
281,00:14:56.38,00:14:56.38,">> Cheers. >> My family's from Puerto Rico,"
282,00:14:59.17,00:14:59.17,and it totally reminds me of Puerto Rico and waterfalls and
283,00:15:02.12,00:15:02.12,the rain forest. It reminds me of my family and a
284,00:15:05.67,00:15:05.67,lot of the vacations we used to take as kids.
285,00:15:08.00,00:15:08.00,"These doughnuts are, like, redonkulous."
286,00:15:10.71,00:15:10.71,"The food is fantastic, and having these waterfalls surround"
287,00:15:14.33,00:15:14.33,you altogether makes for an amazing reward.
288,00:15:17.62,00:15:17.62,Cheers. >> Sweet tea.
289,00:15:20.17,00:15:20.17,">> And lemon, too. >> Okay."
290,00:15:27.75,00:15:27.75,"""So you've won a reward, You'll have fun and you'll eat."
291,00:15:31.54,00:15:31.54,"But you didn't come here for food,"
292,00:15:34.17,00:15:34.17,You came here to compete. Clue #1
293,00:15:38.12,00:15:38.12,"The real prize is information, On how to stay safe in this"
294,00:15:41.33,00:15:41.33,"game. Hidden at your camp is an idol,"
295,00:15:44.29,00:15:44.29,"And 'Immunity' is its name."" >> I say we share the info with"
296,00:15:47.92,00:15:47.92,"all the Galus and we got a, we got a free trigger to pull."
297,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,>> There is another hidden immunity idol that has been put
298,00:15:55.62,00:15:55.62,into play that is hiding at camp somewhere.
299,00:15:58.29,00:15:58.29,"So because there's no members of the old Foa Foa here, we're"
300,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,"going to keep that information strictly, you know, Galu right"
301,00:16:06.00,00:16:06.00,now. >> I'm happy just with everyone
302,00:16:08.25,00:16:08.25,here. (Dave burps)
303,00:16:10.25,00:16:10.25,>> Right now I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable
304,00:16:12.62,00:16:12.62,with the plan of sort of knocking off Foa Foa after Foa
305,00:16:16.29,00:16:16.29,Foa. >> We need to get a Foa Foa gone
306,00:16:19.67,00:16:19.67,for sure. Who-- do you think Russell?
307,00:16:21.79,00:16:21.79,>> Hmm? >> Who do you think should go
308,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,from Foa Foa? >> I don't want Russell to go.
309,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,">> I know, but he's super strategic."
310,00:16:31.96,00:16:31.96,">> He's strategic, but he sucks at challenges."
311,00:16:34.17,00:16:34.17,We can beat him. >> Shambo-- she's protecting
312,00:16:37.54,00:16:37.54,"Russell, you know? Russell's one of the most"
313,00:16:39.58,00:16:39.58,conniving players I feel like we have going in the game right
314,00:16:41.42,00:16:41.42,"now. Like, he needs to go."
315,00:16:46.25,00:16:46.25,Yeah. >> Because Russell didn't even
316,00:16:49.75,00:16:49.75,have a clue. >> I know.
317,00:16:53.42,00:16:53.42,">> If I had to pick one person that would, I think, go over to"
318,00:16:56.08,00:16:56.08,"Foa Foa, it would definitely be Shambo."
319,00:17:00.33,00:17:00.33,"But whether Shambo's with us or not, we still have six to five"
320,00:17:03.62,00:17:03.62,"if she goes with them, and we don't really need them."
321,00:17:16.08,00:17:16.08,>> I don't care about no damn reward.
322,00:17:19.08,00:17:19.08,I'm here to win the game. I'm gonna find the next immunity
323,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,idol and I ain't going to tell a damn soul.
324,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00,"You know, I thought maybe it might be around tree mail, it"
325,00:17:43.67,00:17:43.67,"might be around the water, or it might be around the bridge."
326,00:17:47.75,00:17:47.75,"It has to be near something-- a landmark, something."
327,00:17:51.08,00:17:51.08,"It cannot be any other place. That's where it has to be,"
328,00:17:54.79,00:17:54.79,around them areas. That easy.
329,00:18:08.38,00:18:08.38,Think I just found the second hidden immunity idol without a
330,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,clue. (laughs)
331,00:18:16.62,00:18:16.62,This is crazy. This might be worth one million
332,00:18:21.29,00:18:21.29,dollars. This is it-- number two.
333,00:18:28.92,00:18:28.92,This is amazing. Am I that damn good?
334,00:18:34.08,00:18:34.08,(laughs) This is just unprecedented.
335,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,I missed fried chicken and brownies for the second hidden
336,00:18:41.83,00:18:41.83,immunity idol. Sounds like a good exchange to
337,00:18:46.83,00:18:46.83,"me. >> All right, dude."
338,00:19:08.00,00:19:08.00,"All righty, then. >> Yesterday, I found the"
339,00:19:11.21,00:19:11.21,immunity idol without anybody telling me anything.
340,00:19:13.83,00:19:13.83,"Well, I think I want to share something with you."
341,00:19:16.21,00:19:16.21,"Not two in a row, that's just the gift that I have."
342,00:19:20.12,00:19:20.12,This was why I was born. I was going to keep it to
343,00:19:23.88,00:19:23.88,"myself, but we only have four people left from Foa Foa."
344,00:19:27.29,00:19:27.29,So you have to have help with it.
345,00:19:30.42,00:19:30.42,I can trust you more than I can trust anybody out here.
346,00:19:34.75,00:19:34.75,>> As I do you. >> So...
347,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,">> Dude, you do... you are..."
348,00:19:41.33,00:19:41.33,Tell me you... >> So you're going to have
349,00:19:48.21,00:19:48.21,to... you're going to have to to help me help you.
350,00:19:51.17,00:19:51.17,">> Dude, dude, her head is getting fricking lopped off."
351,00:19:54.92,00:19:54.92,>> You're right. We vote Laura.
352,00:19:56.96,00:19:56.96,>> It's a samurai sword. >> This is just going to be a
353,00:20:03.08,00:20:03.08,wonderful thing. Shocker.
354,00:20:05.21,00:20:05.21,>> You lucky bastard! I cannot believe you found both
355,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,those fricking immunity idols. >> The lucky thing helps
356,00:20:11.38,00:20:11.38,"us both. >> Oh, my God!"
357,00:20:13.00,00:20:13.00,I have been pretty much aligned with Foa Foa for the last
358,00:20:15.21,00:20:15.21,two weeks. I really hit it off with those
359,00:20:18.71,00:20:18.71,"guys, created some really great relationships."
360,00:20:21.79,00:20:21.79,Russ is probably the one guy in this game that I impeccably
361,00:20:24.04,00:20:24.04,trust. >> You're right in the same boat
362,00:20:27.00,00:20:27.00,I'm in right now. >> That is so funny.
363,00:20:29.25,00:20:29.25,>> Right now it has no holes. It had holes and it was a
364,00:20:32.12,00:20:32.12,"sinking ship before, but we patched them up."
365,00:20:34.92,00:20:34.92,>> Wow! >> It's time to sail on.
366,00:20:37.92,00:20:37.92,"(laughter) You know, I'm going to need help"
367,00:20:41.12,00:20:41.12,to make sure my name is on the chopping block.
368,00:20:43.54,00:20:43.54,>> That's already been put into motion.
369,00:20:45.79,00:20:45.79,This is going to be unbelievable.
370,00:20:49.04,00:20:49.04,"Our plan is let them vote Russell, so when six of them"
371,00:20:52.25,00:20:52.25,"vote Russell, we'll come back and vote Laura."
372,00:20:55.12,00:20:55.12,He'll play the hidden immunity idol and she'll go home.
373,00:20:59.42,00:20:59.42,So I am so excited. The only thing that can derail
374,00:21:06.75,00:21:06.75,"this is her winning immunity. >> If Medusa wins immunity, we"
375,00:21:11.12,00:21:11.12,get rid of one of her posse. Yup.
376,00:21:13.67,00:21:13.67,And then she's going to be scrambling.
377,00:21:15.46,00:21:15.46,>> They have a disdain for Monica-- the boys do-- that
378,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,will eliminate her immediately. But nobody's got anything on
379,00:21:22.58,00:21:22.58,"Kelly, nobody's got anything against Kelly, so Kelly's a"
380,00:21:24.71,00:21:24.71,bigger threat than Monica. >> Right.
381,00:21:38.04,00:21:38.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Guys ready to get to today's"
382,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,immunity challenge? >> Yes.
383,00:21:53.17,00:21:53.17,">> PROBST: First things first, I'll take back the immunity"
384,00:21:55.21,00:21:55.21,necklaces. >> You can borrow it for a
385,00:21:58.00,00:21:58.00,"little while, Jeff. >> PROBST: I'm going to be"
386,00:21:59.96,00:21:59.96,"giving it back to you? All right, I like it."
387,00:22:03.04,00:22:03.04,"Thank you, Laura. Today, only one immunity"
388,00:22:06.21,00:22:06.21,"necklace. Once again, immunity is back up"
389,00:22:10.25,00:22:10.25,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
390,00:22:14.67,00:22:14.67,"use a grappling hook to retrieve two bags, each containing a"
391,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,puzzle peg. The first three to get their
392,00:22:21.50,00:22:21.50,bags move on to the final round where you must place one of
393,00:22:26.21,00:22:26.21,those pegs in its appropriate spot on the board.
394,00:22:29.58,00:22:29.58,"Each time you place a peg, another one drops down."
395,00:22:33.04,00:22:33.04,First person to get all their pegs in the right spot wins
396,00:22:36.04,00:22:36.04,immunity. Guaranteed a one in ten shot at
397,00:22:41.58,00:22:41.58,"a million dollars. All right, we'll draw for spots."
398,00:22:45.29,00:22:45.29,"We'll get started. All right, here we go."
399,00:22:49.67,00:22:49.67,First three to get both their bags move on to the final round.
400,00:22:53.46,00:22:53.46,Survivors ready? Go!
401,00:23:00.62,00:23:00.62,Bit of a learning curve. How much rope to hold onto.
402,00:23:03.71,00:23:03.71,"Nice toss by Russell. Just misses the bag, but a great"
403,00:23:07.58,00:23:07.58,toss. Shambo makes a snag.
404,00:23:11.04,00:23:11.04,Now she's got to reel it in. Shambo has her first bag.
405,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,Mick with a good toss. He hooks it.
406,00:23:18.46,00:23:18.46,Mick got his first bag. Kelly has her first bag.
407,00:23:23.29,00:23:23.29,Brett on target. Brett has his first bag.
408,00:23:27.92,00:23:27.92,>> Damn it! >> PROBST: Mick has his second
409,00:23:29.96,00:23:29.96,bag. Making quick work of it.
410,00:23:32.38,00:23:32.38,Mick moving on. Looking for two more people.
411,00:23:35.88,00:23:35.88,"Natalie with her first bag, but she loses it."
412,00:23:39.08,00:23:39.08,>> My hook's stuck. >> PROBST: Go get it.
413,00:23:46.79,00:23:46.79,Jaison with his first bag. Laura with the long toss.
414,00:23:53.12,00:23:53.12,Laura has her first bag. Russell just barely hooks a bag.
415,00:24:02.17,00:24:02.17,Got his first one. Shambo with a good toss.
416,00:24:08.79,00:24:08.79,"And she hooks it! >> Got it, Jeff."
417,00:24:12.62,00:24:12.62,>> PROBST: Shambo has both bags. Shambo's moving on!
418,00:24:15.25,00:24:15.25,"One more person moving on. Laura, Kelly, Brett, Jaison,"
419,00:24:20.79,00:24:20.79,"Russell, all looking for that last bag."
420,00:24:24.08,00:24:24.08,Russell with a good toss. Can he turn it into a snag?
421,00:24:27.21,00:24:27.21,He does. Russell has his second bag!
422,00:24:29.88,00:24:29.88,Laura has her second bag! It's a race!
423,00:24:37.46,00:24:37.46,Russell loses his! Laura has hers!
424,00:24:39.75,00:24:39.75,"Laura moving on! Laura, Mick, Shambo moving on"
425,00:24:46.62,00:24:46.62,to the final round. Here we go.
426,00:24:54.04,00:24:54.04,"Final round for immunity is Laura, Mick, and Shambo."
427,00:24:58.00,00:24:58.00,Survivors ready? Go.
428,00:25:03.12,00:25:03.12,"Each bag has a peg. One peg will fit in that board,"
429,00:25:07.21,00:25:07.21,one peg will not fit. You have to choose the right
430,00:25:10.42,00:25:10.42,one to start your sequence. Mick has both his pegs.
431,00:25:14.46,00:25:14.46,"Trying to find a spot. The question is, which is the"
432,00:25:18.67,00:25:18.67,first peg to fit? Shambo has both her pegs.
433,00:25:25.08,00:25:25.08,"Once you find that first one, it will start the sequence."
434,00:25:28.75,00:25:28.75,Shambo has her first piece. Shambo places another piece.
435,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,">> Yeah, Sham. >> PROBST: Mick trying to"
436,00:25:36.04,00:25:36.04,force it. Is it right?
437,00:25:38.08,00:25:38.08,"Mick has his first piece. >> Go, Mick."
438,00:25:40.17,00:25:40.17,>> PROBST: Laura has both her pegs.
439,00:25:47.92,00:25:47.92,"Shambo with another piece. >> Come on, Sham."
440,00:25:51.21,00:25:51.21,">> Relax, relax. Think, think."
441,00:25:55.00,00:25:55.00,>> PROBST: Mick has another piece.
442,00:25:57.58,00:25:57.58,Immunity on the line. A guaranteed one-in-ten shot at
443,00:26:01.50,00:26:01.50,a million bucks. Laura has her first piece.
444,00:26:05.21,00:26:05.21,Laura has her second piece. Shambo places another one.
445,00:26:11.71,00:26:11.71,Laura with her third piece now. Laura places another piece.
446,00:26:18.25,00:26:18.25,"Laura like clockwork on this, like she's done this before."
447,00:26:24.04,00:26:24.04,"Laura with another one! >> All you got to do is look at,"
448,00:26:27.38,00:26:27.38,look at the piece. >> PROBST: Mick studying while
449,00:26:30.08,00:26:30.08,Laura continues to place pieces effortlessly.
450,00:26:35.54,00:26:35.54,">> Total square, total square, total square."
451,00:26:38.50,00:26:38.50,>> PROBST: Laura really running away with the challenge
452,00:26:41.25,00:26:41.25,right now. Gonna have to work to catch
453,00:26:43.04,00:26:43.04,catch Laura. >> Look at the piece.
454,00:26:45.54,00:26:45.54,Look at the piece. >> Come on.
455,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,">> Arrow left, arrow left, arrow left."
456,00:26:50.58,00:26:50.58,">> PROBST: Laura still talking to herself, and it's working."
457,00:26:53.62,00:26:53.62,>> Right there. Laura getting very close.
458,00:27:03.54,00:27:03.54,>> Wow. >> PROBST: Laura down to her
459,00:27:05.79,00:27:05.79,last piece. Laura wins individual immunity!
460,00:27:11.33,00:27:11.33,"Safe tonight at Tribal Council. >> Good job, girl."
461,00:27:19.08,00:27:19.08,">> PROBST: Laura, come on over. >> Good job."
462,00:27:21.38,00:27:21.38,>> PROBST: Back-to-back immunity wins.
463,00:27:26.71,00:27:26.71,Laura is safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
464,00:27:29.54,00:27:29.54,"As for the rest of you, one of you going home tonight."
465,00:27:32.75,00:27:32.75,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
466,00:27:34.21,00:27:34.21,I will see you at Tribal. Congratulations.
467,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,">> Thanks. >> Right now, we're just"
468,00:27:37.46,00:27:37.46,"getting rid of Foa Foa. Clearly, Russell's the first one"
469,00:27:39.75,00:27:39.75,to go because he's lied to us all.
470,00:27:41.96,00:27:41.96,"I see the Galu tribe voting for Russell, including Natalie."
471,00:27:46.62,00:27:46.62,"I think she wants to make good that she's in, so tonight"
472,00:27:50.25,00:27:50.25,"Russell's going home. >> Good job, Laura."
473,00:28:14.21,00:28:14.21,">> Oh, the challenge sucked 'cause Laura won, and now we"
474,00:28:16.42,00:28:16.42,"can't vote her off, and my heart is broken."
475,00:28:20.29,00:28:20.29,I'm so sad. I'm pissed.
476,00:28:26.92,00:28:26.92,"I think you always have to have a plan B, and I said in the"
477,00:28:31.04,00:28:31.04,"off chance that she did get immunity today, that we'd vote"
478,00:28:34.42,00:28:34.42,Kel 'cause Kelly's stronger than Monica.
479,00:28:36.96,00:28:36.96,Monica's no threat whatsoever. So eliminate somebody that's
480,00:28:40.21,00:28:40.21,"close to Laura, cause a little dissension amongst the ranks."
481,00:28:44.25,00:28:44.25,That's the plan of attack. >> I found another
482,00:28:51.92,00:28:51.92,immunity idol. >> Bull ...
483,00:28:53.83,00:28:53.83,Where'd you find it? >> At the bridge.
484,00:28:58.08,00:28:58.08,">> Nicely done, my man. You deserve this, man."
485,00:29:02.92,00:29:02.92,"You deserve this, for real. >> Dude..."
486,00:29:05.21,00:29:05.21,>> Listen... >> I know what's happening.
487,00:29:07.29,00:29:07.29,"Hopefully, they trying to vote me out."
488,00:29:10.62,00:29:10.62,"So trust me, just vote Kelly. Everything else is fine."
489,00:29:14.67,00:29:14.67,>> So Russell found another idol that the Galu members don't
490,00:29:17.67,00:29:17.67,"know about. And, uh, the idea is to"
491,00:29:21.58,00:29:21.58,"surprise them with it. It's a gamble, baby."
492,00:29:24.71,00:29:24.71,">> It's a gamble. >> All right, I'm with you."
493,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,"If Galu gets wind of what's going on, they're gonna change"
494,00:29:30.67,00:29:30.67,their vote and they'll take somebody on Foa Foa out that's
495,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,"not Russell, and it's all a waste."
496,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,So it's gotta to be Russell tonight or we're all through.
497,00:29:42.75,00:29:42.75,>> There's an immunity idol. So the idea is to focus all
498,00:29:45.79,00:29:45.79,the attention on Russell... >> He found another one?
499,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,>> He found another. It's under the bridge.
500,00:29:56.50,00:29:56.50,Hi. What's going on? >> So Russell found the idol.
501,00:30:08.12,00:30:08.12,It's unbelievable how he finds these things.
502,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,"And so quickly, too. He just has a keen mind for it,"
503,00:30:13.12,00:30:13.12,you know? >> I'm really beginning to love
504,00:30:16.33,00:30:16.33,that guy. I'm really beginning
505,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,to love him. >> He's good at this thing.
506,00:30:21.04,00:30:21.04,I didn't know there would be a second one.
507,00:30:23.21,00:30:23.21,So I'm excited to see what happens tonight at
508,00:30:25.21,00:30:25.21,Tribal Council. We all hope to put a dent in
509,00:30:27.96,00:30:27.96,Galu today and put a big dent in that arrogance and
510,00:30:30.58,00:30:30.58,condescending patronizing attitude they have towards us.
511,00:30:34.38,00:30:34.38,">> So remind me-- Russell, Natalie, Mick, Jaison, right?"
512,00:30:38.04,00:30:38.04,>> Should we plan for just in case that one of them may find
513,00:30:41.83,00:30:41.83,an idol? Because if we all vote for
514,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,"Russell, and then say Russell has the idol again, at that"
515,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,"point the other person goes home, and it's one of us."
516,00:30:51.12,00:30:51.12,">> That... All right, listen. We can't worry about that"
517,00:30:53.71,00:30:53.71,right now. Now's not the time for that.
518,00:30:55.92,00:30:55.92,"Like, they don't know anything about it."
519,00:30:57.33,00:30:57.33,>> I can tell you if it were me and I was on Foa Foa and I were
520,00:31:00.96,00:31:00.96,over here... >> I'd be looking for the idol.
521,00:31:02.96,00:31:02.96,>> I would assume that it was here.
522,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,">> Mm-hmm. >> I mean, that's not rocket"
523,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,science. >> Which means they found it
524,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"just by digging in tree stumps, though."
525,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83,>> He found a fricking idol without a fricking clue.
526,00:31:12.62,00:31:12.62,">> Here's, here's the thing that..."
527,00:31:14.00,00:31:14.00,"Here's what I, here's all... No, no, no, no."
528,00:31:15.58,00:31:15.58,"That's what makes me nervous, right?"
529,00:31:17.12,00:31:17.12, >> I don't think he has it. I don't think he even...
530,00:31:19.83,00:31:19.83,"If he suspects there's one here, I'd be surprised."
531,00:31:25.00,00:31:25.00,"First vote-- Russ, second vote Natalie, bang..."
532,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,"or vice versa. We can go Natalie first, we can"
533,00:31:30.96,00:31:30.96,go Russ second. >> I say Russ first.
534,00:31:32.62,00:31:32.62,I say Russ. >> I don't know.
535,00:31:43.12,00:31:43.12,>> I think I heard that they were gonna vote Natalie.
536,00:31:45.71,00:31:45.71,"I don't know that, but I heard them say her name."
537,00:31:49.42,00:31:49.42,That's how this game goes. It messes with your mind.
538,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,I think they made their mind up; I think it might be Natalie.
539,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,>> You think it's Natalie? Why do you think that?
540,00:31:59.54,00:31:59.54,>> I don't know. (laughs) >> You got few hours
541,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,to try and sway it to make sure. >> I don't know if I should
542,00:32:09.96,00:32:09.96,play it or not. I'm confused on what to do.
543,00:32:14.21,00:32:14.21,I don't want to be the dumbass that gets voted out with the
544,00:32:17.46,00:32:17.46,"idol in his pocket, and I don't want to be the dumbass that"
545,00:32:20.71,00:32:20.71,"uses the idol again, and then nobody votes my name."
546,00:32:24.08,00:32:24.08,"So now, I don't know what to do with it."
547,00:32:29.33,00:32:29.33,">> And as soon as we burn all the Foa Foas, kill a chicken."
548,00:32:32.88,00:32:32.88,">> Yeah! >> It's our Galu chicken,"
549,00:32:34.62,00:32:34.62,"it's not theirs. >> Yeah, it's not theirs."
550,00:32:36.29,00:32:36.29,>> We're making it pure Galu all the way.
551,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,>> I'm not sharing with anybody that ain't purple.
552,00:32:40.92,00:32:40.92,">> That's right. Right now, I think we're tight."
553,00:32:42.96,00:32:42.96,"The Galu tribe is tight. We don't trust Sham, but we are"
554,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,still definitely six strong. As long as we can get the Foa
555,00:32:50.00,00:32:50.00,"Foa out, and then we have seven of the Galu left, that's what"
556,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,we want. >> I like that.
557,00:32:55.21,00:32:55.21,I'm there. >> PROBST: I'll now bring in
558,00:33:23.54,00:33:23.54,the first member of our jury. Erik voted out at the last
559,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,"Tribal Council. So, Dave, coming into last"
560,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,"Tribal, Galu had the numbers, eight to four."
561,00:33:42.12,00:33:42.12,You voted out one of your own in Erik.
562,00:33:44.92,00:33:44.92,Is that a sign that old tribal lines are gone and this now is
563,00:33:48.29,00:33:48.29,"an individual game? >> Not at all, Jeff."
564,00:33:51.25,00:33:51.25,"To be honest, our tribe was weakened from within by Erik's"
565,00:33:55.42,00:33:55.42,presence. And it was actually a
566,00:33:58.62,00:33:58.62,strengthening of our tribal unity.
567,00:34:01.54,00:34:01.54,">> PROBST: Kelly, how did you feel about last tribal's vote?"
568,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,">> I think there was this uneasiness in the tribe, almost"
569,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,like a snake kind of starting a lot of trouble and it seemed to
570,00:34:11.83,00:34:11.83,"all come back to Erik. So when it comes down to it,"
571,00:34:14.42,00:34:14.42,you have to go with who you trust.
572,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,">> PROBST: Natalie, what's it like at camp?"
573,00:34:19.04,00:34:19.04,"The old Galu tribe is still in charge, in terms of numbers,"
574,00:34:23.25,00:34:23.25,and it's their camp. >> I think they're trying to
575,00:34:25.92,00:34:25.92,"make us still feel welcome, like we're all one."
576,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,>> PROBST: How could they possibly make you feel like
577,00:34:32.96,00:34:32.96,"you're all still one? >> You know, I've been welcomed"
578,00:34:34.92,00:34:34.92,"into the shelter, I sleep with them."
579,00:34:36.58,00:34:36.58,">> PROBST: But Natalie, you're not all still one."
580,00:34:38.58,00:34:38.58,">> You're right. But they're not, like, being"
581,00:34:40.79,00:34:40.79,mean or ugly to anybody. I guess that's more or less
582,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,"what I was trying to say. But the fact of the matter is,"
583,00:34:46.42,00:34:46.42,it is seven to four and they are tight.
584,00:34:49.62,00:34:49.62,">> PROBST: Jaison, what does it say to the Foa Foa foursome"
585,00:34:52.50,00:34:52.50,that Galu was willing to get rid of one of their own?
586,00:34:55.04,00:34:55.04,>> They're very tight-lipped about what's going on over
587,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"there, so it's hard to figure out if there is a crack or not."
588,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,You never know what can happen. Maybe there's another Erik out
589,00:35:04.42,00:35:04.42,there that hasn't been exposed yet.
590,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,So I'm just trying to hold on to some hope.
591,00:35:09.38,00:35:09.38,">> PROBST: Shambo, tell me the state of the game right now,"
592,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,from where you sit. >> It feels like the original
593,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,"Galu is pretty comfortable, and the Foa Foa is kind of holding"
594,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,"on. >> PROBST: So, Mick, if old"
595,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,"tribal lines are holding strong, your only chance is to"
596,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,"keep chipping away. Otherwise, your days are"
597,00:35:29.71,00:35:29.71,"numbered. >> Yeah, absolutely."
598,00:35:32.04,00:35:32.04,"I mean, we know that, the numbers are obvious."
599,00:35:34.00,00:35:34.00,"But we still hope somebody will see past the former Galu,"
600,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,"former Foa Foa, and just see four solid votes and be like ""I"
601,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,"need to make a big move here."" >> PROBST: Russell, so do you"
602,00:35:43.88,00:35:43.88,"spend most of your day observing the Galu seven,"
603,00:35:47.79,00:35:47.79,"trying to figure out-- maybe there's a crack here, maybe I"
604,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,"can get in over here? >> Well, yeah, I did."
605,00:35:53.96,00:35:53.96,"But now, you know, it's getting to where we're hoping that"
606,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,somebody comes to us. Talks to us and wants to do
607,00:35:59.62,00:35:59.62,something. But they seem to be pretty
608,00:36:02.75,00:36:02.75,"tight. >> PROBST: Monica, do you see"
609,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,"Foa Foa people going up to your tribe mates, trying to see if"
610,00:36:09.04,00:36:09.04,they can start some drama? >> I think the Foa Foa see how
611,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,"strong the seven of us are, at this point."
612,00:36:16.12,00:36:16.12,"If they are giving it a try, I give them respect for doing so,"
613,00:36:19.21,00:36:19.21,but I don't think it's that hard of a try that they're
614,00:36:21.46,00:36:21.46,giving. >> PROBST: So at this point in
615,00:36:23.92,00:36:23.92,"the game, Dave, how do you decide who's next?"
616,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,>> I think you just have to assess who's the most
617,00:36:29.08,00:36:29.08,"dangerous, and there are several different criteria, not"
618,00:36:32.71,00:36:32.71,"the least of which is physical ability, mental toughness,"
619,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,"strategic acumen. And it's a communal decision,"
620,00:36:42.42,00:36:42.42,you know? We try to come to a consensus
621,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,so that everybody feels heard and everybody feels that their
622,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,"needs are being met. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
623,00:36:53.12,00:36:53.12,"to the vote. Laura, once again, you have the"
624,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,"immunity necklace, keeping it for yourself?"
625,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,>> Yes. >> PROBST: You can not vote for
626,00:37:00.75,00:37:00.75,Laura. Anybody else is fair game.
627,00:37:03.08,00:37:03.08,"It is time to vote. Brett, you're up."
628,00:37:53.88,00:37:53.88,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
629,00:38:12.79,00:38:12.79,If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to
630,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
631,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,>> I ain't finished playing just yet.
632,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,Keep hope alive. >> PROBST: The rules of
633,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,Survivor state that if someone plays a hidden immunity
634,00:38:46.58,00:38:46.58,"idol, then any votes cast against that person will not"
635,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,count and the person with the next-highest number of votes
636,00:38:52.92,00:38:52.92,will be sent home. This is an idol.
637,00:38:55.92,00:38:55.92,Any votes cast against Russell will not count.
638,00:39:00.12,00:39:00.12,I'll read the votes. First vote--
639,00:39:11.83,00:39:11.83,Russell. Does not count.
640,00:39:23.71,00:39:23.71,Russell. Does not count.
641,00:39:28.62,00:39:28.62,"Russell. That's three votes Russell,"
642,00:39:30.96,00:39:30.96,none of them count. Russell.
643,00:39:36.50,00:39:36.50,Does not count. Russell.
644,00:39:42.08,00:39:42.08,Does not count. Russell.
645,00:39:47.29,00:39:47.29,Does not count. We still have no votes for
646,00:39:50.08,00:39:50.08,anybody. Russell.
647,00:39:56.83,00:39:56.83,Does not count. Kelly.
648,00:40:10.42,00:40:10.42,>> You're kidding me. >> PROBST: That's one vote
649,00:40:12.33,00:40:12.33,"Kelly. >> Oh, my God."
650,00:40:22.62,00:40:22.62,>> PROBST: Two votes Kelly. Eighth person voted out of
651,00:40:28.71,00:40:28.71,"Survivor: Samoa and the second member of our jury, Kelly."
652,00:40:32.12,00:40:32.12,"That's three. Tonight, that's enough."
653,00:40:34.00,00:40:34.00,You need to bring me your torch. >> Wow.
654,00:40:37.12,00:40:37.12,">> Wow. PROBST: Kelly, the tribe has"
655,00:40:50.38,00:40:50.38,spoken. Time for you to go.
656,00:41:07.17,00:41:07.17,"Well, since the merge, there have been two Tribal Councils,"
657,00:41:10.17,00:41:10.17,"two blind sides, two hidden immunity idols played and, once"
658,00:41:13.21,00:41:13.21,"again, the Foa Foa foursome have survived the vote."
659,00:41:16.25,00:41:16.25,"The question is, will tonight's vote change the game or merely"
660,00:41:17.75,00:41:17.75,delay the inevitable? One more thing: the hidden
661,00:41:21.38,00:41:21.38,immunity idol goes back into the game once again.
662,00:41:25.71,00:41:25.71,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
663,00:41:27.46,00:41:27.46,Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our
664,00:41:40.88,00:41:40.88,next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
665,00:41:48.42,00:41:48.42,"Survivor, it's a showdown between Russell and Laura."
666,00:41:52.17,00:41:52.17,">> It's only a matter of time, Russ."
667,00:41:53.17,00:41:53.17,>> I'm ten times smatter than she could ever be.
668,00:41:54.46,00:41:54.46,>> PROBST: And finding the next idol means everything.
669,00:41:57.08,00:41:57.08,>> They're moving. >> Go get them.
670,00:41:59.17,00:41:59.17,"Let's follow them. >> Come on, Dave."
671,00:42:02.12,00:42:02.12,>> We need to keep that hidden 
672,00:42:03.79,00:42:03.79,immunity idol out of Russell's hands.
673,00:42:11.25,00:42:11.25,">> I definitely, definitely wasn't expecting to be going"
674,00:42:12.42,00:42:12.42,home tonight. Everything was working out
675,00:42:14.25,00:42:14.25,perfectly and I hope Galu gets rid of Russell.
676,00:42:16.96,00:42:16.96,It's too many idols. How many can there be.
677,00:42:19.46,00:42:19.46,He's just a little sneaky man and I definitely know that he's
678,00:42:21.42,00:42:21.42,next on the line. Foa Foa stepped in and totally I think took us all by surprise.
679,00:42:23.25,00:42:23.25,I don't know if anyone from my tribe was involved but I'm
680,00:42:25.00,00:42:25.00,totally shocked.
