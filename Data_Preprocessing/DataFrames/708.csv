51,00:03:35.57,00:03:35.57,when you heard me saythat you were
52,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,going to have a chanceto get back in this game.
53,00:03:40.40,00:03:40.40,">> I almost wet my pants,to tell you the truth."
54,00:03:44.07,00:03:44.07,"It was just amazing,but we had"
55,00:03:46.57,00:03:46.57,"one thing on our minds, andit was just winning for revenge."
56,00:03:49.03,00:03:49.03,So...>> PROBST: How big a factor
57,00:03:51.23,00:03:51.23,"was that for you, Ryan?You've got ""Die, jerks"""
58,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,"on your head.Oh, it was a huge,"
59,00:03:56.60,00:03:56.60,"huge motivation, because, uh,I felt I was never"
60,00:03:59.97,00:03:59.97,let into the tribe.And I felt like
61,00:04:02.30,00:04:02.30,"a complete outcast.So, uh, for me"
62,00:04:04.33,00:04:04.33,to come back and thenjust to look over
63,00:04:06.60,00:04:06.60,after we already wonand saw those guys
64,00:04:08.70,00:04:08.70,"still struggling,having no clue"
65,00:04:10.37,00:04:10.37,"what they're doing...You know, that, that,"
66,00:04:12.47,00:04:12.47,that feeling of revenge--unbelievable.
67,00:04:14.70,00:04:14.70,>> PROBST: I've never seena celebration like that
68,00:04:17.20,00:04:17.20,at any challenge everin Survivor.
69,00:04:19.83,00:04:19.83,"Burton, what was the key factorfor you guys doing so well?"
70,00:04:24.10,00:04:24.10,>> It was an internal drivethat we all had.
71,00:04:27.83,00:04:27.83,We all pulled togetherand we were determined--
72,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,no matter what the game was--to win.
73,00:04:33.70,00:04:33.70,And we were not goingto stop at anything short.
74,00:04:36.40,00:04:36.40,"So, this second chance,for all of you guys, is huge."
75,00:04:40.93,00:04:40.93,"Okay, here's howit's going to work tonight."
76,00:04:43.17,00:04:43.17,What we're going to dois give each of you
77,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,a chance to plead your caseabout why you should represent
78,00:04:48.60,00:04:48.60,the Outcast Tribeand go back into the game.
79,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,Nicole...you got a lot of grudges.
80,00:04:55.27,00:04:55.27,"I mean, they voted you outfirst."
81,00:04:57.63,00:04:57.63,Why should these guysput you back in?
82,00:04:59.53,00:04:59.53,I think one of the mostimportant reasons
83,00:05:01.70,00:05:01.70,I should go back inis because I was voted out
84,00:05:03.93,00:05:03.93,for being the bad apple.And I think my biggest
85,00:05:05.90,00:05:05.90,mistake in the gamewas speaking my mind
86,00:05:07.70,00:05:07.70,which I think is alsoone of my best traits.
87,00:05:09.87,00:05:09.87,I think thatI'll be able to bring
88,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"that true characterback into the game,"
89,00:05:13.53,00:05:13.53,because it turns both ways.I'll be able to kick some ass
90,00:05:16.33,00:05:16.33,"with that same characterand, um, I think"
91,00:05:18.57,00:05:18.57,I'll make you all proud.>> PROBST: Well said.
92,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50,"Lill, why should they sendyou back in there?"
93,00:05:24.47,00:05:24.47,>> I went out thereand I gave it my all.
94,00:05:27.67,00:05:27.67,And I still want to prove themson of a bitches
95,00:05:29.93,00:05:29.93,"that I am tough.I want to go back in, guys,"
96,00:05:33.03,00:05:33.03,"and I want to go back in hard.No matter what happens tonight,"
97,00:05:36.37,00:05:36.37,this was good.This was sweet revenge.
98,00:05:39.27,00:05:39.27,">> PROBST: Trish, make yourcase."
99,00:05:41.83,00:05:41.83,">> All right.The bottom line is,"
100,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,"through this whole game,I never took my eye"
101,00:05:47.57,00:05:47.57,"off of why I was here.And I absolutely,"
102,00:05:50.40,00:05:50.40,really want one of usto win the million dollars.
103,00:05:53.87,00:05:53.87,"So, put me back in the gameand I'll make sure that,"
104,00:05:56.60,00:05:56.60,"you know, one of the Outcastsis the winner at the very end."
105,00:06:00.20,00:06:00.20,">> PROBST: Michelle, I know youwant back in this game."
106,00:06:03.70,00:06:03.70,"Convince them.>> All right, fellas,"
107,00:06:06.43,00:06:06.43,this is what it comes down to.We all know we're all deserving.
108,00:06:10.53,00:06:10.53,We've all beenkicked in the face.
109,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,"And I'm telling you right now,there's no better way to kick"
110,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,those ass ...back in the face
111,00:06:17.10,00:06:17.10,than by putting a sweet littlegirl in there to do it for you.
112,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,"( laughing )You put me in there,"
113,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,and I'll bring the Outcastsstraight to the top
114,00:06:24.37,00:06:24.37,"where we should be.>> PROBST: Ryan, your job now"
115,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,is to convince themthat you're the man.
116,00:06:31.37,00:06:31.37,">> Uh, you guys knowhow much I love"
117,00:06:34.87,00:06:34.87,"this game, and, uh,you guys know how much heart"
118,00:06:38.17,00:06:38.17,I have for the game.Give me a chance

124,00:06:57.43,00:06:57.43,"I swear to God,there was nothing"
125,00:06:59.40,00:06:59.40,I was going to donot to let that happen.
126,00:07:02.07,00:07:02.07,"And I'll also say thatwhoever else goes in there,"
127,00:07:04.40,00:07:04.40,"if I'm able to go in,you have my word"

574,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,>> What is she doing?>> I have no idea.

584,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,before the other three people.You guys would have
585,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,ditched me in a minuteif we stayed as Morgans.
586,00:34:59.07,00:34:59.07,I had immunity.>> And you don't think they

602,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,"because I think the Drake Tribe,they want to vote out the"
603,00:35:46.73,00:35:46.73,"strongest on the Morgan side.And, definitely, the swing vote"
604,00:35:48.87,00:35:48.87,tonight could be Lill.She could potentially go
605,00:35:51.07,00:35:51.07,with Morgan or Drake.>> PROBST: Welcome.
606,00:36:10.77,00:36:10.77,"First thing I need to ask...T, what was the reaction today"
607,00:36:14.37,00:36:14.37,when you guys heardthere was going to be a merge?
608,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,">> Shocked.Um, because it is a"
609,00:36:19.70,00:36:19.70,"merge that can be of a benefit,but it also can hurt us all."
610,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"Overall, I'm looking at it inan optimistic view,"
611,00:36:26.70,00:36:26.70,but it... it was a shock.It was a shock.
612,00:36:30.03,00:36:30.03,">> PROBST: Lill, you goback to Morgan, you're there"
613,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,"for a day, and then, suddenly,you merge."

615,00:36:36.97,00:36:36.97,>> I am thrilled.I'm thrilled with the merger.
616,00:36:39.87,00:36:39.87,I'm ready for it.I'm just glad that
617,00:36:43.07,00:36:43.07,"I now have a larger family.>> PROBST: Ryno, you still"
618,00:36:46.40,00:36:46.40,"have 18 days left in the game.Now you're one big tribe,"
619,00:36:49.27,00:36:49.27,and it is an individual game.So how do you vote
620,00:36:51.80,00:36:51.80,"from this point forward?>> Yeah, it... it's hard for me"
621,00:36:54.20,00:36:54.20,"right now.I... I'm looking at everybody,"
622,00:36:56.47,00:36:56.47,and I... I don't know themwell enough to write their name

624,00:37:03.37,00:37:03.37,"was so great today,and then coming here,"

626,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,the individual immunityworks in terms of assigning
627,00:37:12.43,00:37:12.43,it to someone.It's a little unusual tonight.
628,00:37:15.87,00:37:15.87,"Lill and Burton, as a resultof resurrecting themselves back"
629,00:37:19.37,00:37:19.37,"into this game, were givenimmunity simply to give"
630,00:37:22.63,00:37:22.63,them a chance to reintegrateback into this game.
631,00:37:25.30,00:37:25.30,Burton then goes and winsindividual immunity today.
632,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,"That immunity is assignable,meaning you can give"
633,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,it to somebody elsehere tonight and protect them.
634,00:37:34.40,00:37:34.40,"Typically, that would make you,yourself, vulnerable."
635,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"Tonight, you won't be.You have nothing to lose"
636,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,"by giving it to somebody.So, Burton, do you want to give"
637,00:37:43.03,00:37:43.03,that immunity to anybody?I've done a lot of thinking
638,00:37:45.30,00:37:45.30,"about it and, uh...it is quite an unusual"
639,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"situation, and I do believeI will pass this immunity on."
640,00:37:56.37,00:37:56.37,"Such a close fight,I couldn't not give it to you."
641,00:38:03.13,00:38:03.13,There are now three peopleyou cannot vote for tonight.
642,00:38:05.53,00:38:05.53,"You cannot vote for Lill,you cannot vote"
643,00:38:08.13,00:38:08.13,"for Burton and, now,you cannot vote"
644,00:38:10.40,00:38:10.40,for Rupert as well.Time to vote.
