1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.77,00:00:02.77,Survivor: The Morgan and Drake tribes
3,00:00:04.83,00:00:04.83,were surprised by a big twist. Your past has come back
4,00:00:07.27,00:00:07.27,to haunt you. The six members that were
5,00:00:10.10,00:00:10.10,previously voted off returned as a third tribe
6,00:00:13.57,00:00:13.57,"with one thing on their mind. >> Revenge, baby."
7,00:00:16.37,00:00:16.37,All about revenge. >> PROBST: The Outcasts will
8,00:00:18.53,00:00:18.53,compete against Morgan and Drake in a three-tribe challenge
9,00:00:21.90,00:00:21.90,and the stakes are severe. Go!
10,00:00:26.60,00:00:26.60,It was an all-out battle as the Outcasts
11,00:00:28.47,00:00:28.47,were playing for a chance to get back in the game.
12,00:00:31.90,00:00:31.90,"In the end, the unbelievable happened..."
13,00:00:34.23,00:00:34.23,The Outcasts defeat Morgan and Drake!
14,00:00:36.93,00:00:36.93,"...forcing Morgan and Drake to Tribal Council,"
15,00:00:38.93,00:00:38.93,"each to vote out one of their own,"
16,00:00:40.90,00:00:40.90,while the Outcasts would vote two of their own back in.
17,00:00:43.93,00:00:43.93,"Back at Morgan, frustration hit an all-time high."
18,00:00:46.20,00:00:46.20,>> The misfits... >> Yeah.
19,00:00:48.27,00:00:48.27,>> ...have no right to be here. >> None.
20,00:00:50.57,00:00:50.57,>> None. >> PROBST: And Osten finally
21,00:00:52.70,00:00:52.70,"threw in the towel. >> Vote me right off,"
22,00:00:55.33,00:00:55.33,"'cause I don't deserve to win. >> PROBST: At Drake, Jon and"
23,00:00:58.10,00:00:58.10,Shawn were on the chopping block.
24,00:01:00.20,00:01:00.20,">> I want both of you, if you would, sit down and just"
25,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63,say why we should keep you. >> I feel that I've shown that
26,00:01:05.33,00:01:05.33,"I'm loyal to Drake. >> Jon, I feel like"
27,00:01:08.20,00:01:08.20,I can't trust him. >> PROBST: Drake went to Tribal
28,00:01:10.10,00:01:10.10,"Council first, and made their decision."
29,00:01:12.23,00:01:12.23,Shawn. The tribe has spoken.
30,00:01:17.03,00:01:17.03,"The Morgan Tribal Council then followed,"
31,00:01:20.23,00:01:20.23,"and Osten laid down his torch. You had enough, Osten?"
32,00:01:23.27,00:01:23.27,">> Yeah, I'm quitting. I-I just can't go any further."
33,00:01:25.73,00:01:25.73,>> PROBST: This is a first for me.
34,00:01:28.00,00:01:28.00,No need to vote. Grab your torch.
35,00:01:30.00,00:01:30.00,"Osten, per your wishes... go home."
36,00:01:35.63,00:01:35.63,"Tonight, the Outcasts begin where Drake and Morgan"
37,00:01:38.43,00:01:38.43,left off... at Tribal Council. Find out which two Outcasts
38,00:01:42.43,00:01:42.43,will be voted back into the game.

41,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,>> PROBST: Come on in. Have a seat.
42,00:03:07.23,00:03:07.23,"Look at all these smiling faces: Nicole, Skinny Ryan,"
43,00:03:11.90,00:03:11.90,"Lill, Burton, Michelle and Trish."
44,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,"Well, this is a first. A tribe excited to come"
45,00:03:18.97,00:03:18.97,to Tribal Council. ( laughing )
46,00:03:21.97,00:03:21.97,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
47,00:03:24.23,00:03:24.23,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: You guys did it,"
48,00:03:26.07,00:03:26.07,you came back as a tribe of Outcasts.
49,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,You defeated both Morgan and Drake.
50,00:03:30.43,00:03:30.43,"And tonight, you will now vote two of you back into this game."
51,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57,"But first, Michelle, tell me your reaction"
52,00:03:35.57,00:03:35.57,when you heard me say that you were
53,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,going to have a chance to get back in this game.
54,00:03:40.40,00:03:40.40,">> I almost wet my pants, to tell you the truth."
55,00:03:44.07,00:03:44.07,"It was just amazing, but we had"
56,00:03:46.57,00:03:46.57,"one thing on our minds, and it was just winning for revenge."
57,00:03:49.03,00:03:49.03,So... >> PROBST: How big a factor
58,00:03:51.23,00:03:51.23,"was that for you, Ryan? You've got ""Die, jerks"""
59,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,"on your head. Oh, it was a huge,"
60,00:03:56.60,00:03:56.60,"huge motivation, because, uh, I felt I was never"
61,00:03:59.97,00:03:59.97,let into the tribe. And I felt like
62,00:04:02.30,00:04:02.30,"a complete outcast. So, uh, for me"
63,00:04:04.33,00:04:04.33,to come back and then just to look over
64,00:04:06.60,00:04:06.60,after we already won and saw those guys
65,00:04:08.70,00:04:08.70,"still struggling, having no clue"
66,00:04:10.37,00:04:10.37,"what they're doing... You know, that, that,"
67,00:04:12.47,00:04:12.47,that feeling of revenge-- unbelievable.
68,00:04:14.70,00:04:14.70,>> PROBST: I've never seen a celebration like that
69,00:04:17.20,00:04:17.20,at any challenge ever in Survivor.
70,00:04:19.83,00:04:19.83,"Burton, what was the key factor for you guys doing so well?"
71,00:04:24.10,00:04:24.10,>> It was an internal drive that we all had.
72,00:04:27.83,00:04:27.83,We all pulled together and we were determined--
73,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,no matter what the game was-- to win.
74,00:04:33.70,00:04:33.70,And we were not going to stop at anything short.
75,00:04:36.40,00:04:36.40,"So, this second chance, for all of you guys, is huge."
76,00:04:40.93,00:04:40.93,"Okay, here's how it's going to work tonight."
77,00:04:43.17,00:04:43.17,What we're going to do is give each of you
78,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,a chance to plead your case about why you should represent
79,00:04:48.60,00:04:48.60,the Outcast Tribe and go back into the game.
80,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,Nicole... you got a lot of grudges.
81,00:04:55.27,00:04:55.27,"I mean, they voted you out first."
82,00:04:57.63,00:04:57.63,Why should these guys put you back in?
83,00:04:59.53,00:04:59.53,I think one of the most important reasons
84,00:05:01.70,00:05:01.70,I should go back in is because I was voted out
85,00:05:03.93,00:05:03.93,for being the bad apple. And I think my biggest
86,00:05:05.90,00:05:05.90,mistake in the game was speaking my mind
87,00:05:07.70,00:05:07.70,which I think is also one of my best traits.
88,00:05:09.87,00:05:09.87,I think that I'll be able to bring
89,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"that true character back into the game,"
90,00:05:13.53,00:05:13.53,because it turns both ways. I'll be able to kick some ass
91,00:05:16.33,00:05:16.33,"with that same character and, um, I think"
92,00:05:18.57,00:05:18.57,I'll make you all proud. >> PROBST: Well said.
93,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50,"Lill, why should they send you back in there?"
94,00:05:24.47,00:05:24.47,>> I went out there and I gave it my all.
95,00:05:27.67,00:05:27.67,And I still want to prove them son of a bitches
96,00:05:29.93,00:05:29.93,"that I am tough. I want to go back in, guys,"
97,00:05:33.03,00:05:33.03,"and I want to go back in hard. No matter what happens tonight,"
98,00:05:36.37,00:05:36.37,this was good. This was sweet revenge.
99,00:05:39.27,00:05:39.27,">> PROBST: Trish, make your case."
100,00:05:41.83,00:05:41.83,">> All right. The bottom line is,"
101,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,"through this whole game, I never took my eye"
102,00:05:47.57,00:05:47.57,"off of why I was here. And I absolutely,"
103,00:05:50.40,00:05:50.40,really want one of us to win the million dollars.
104,00:05:53.87,00:05:53.87,"So, put me back in the game and I'll make sure that,"
105,00:05:56.60,00:05:56.60,"you know, one of the Outcasts is the winner at the very end."
106,00:06:00.20,00:06:00.20,">> PROBST: Michelle, I know you want back in this game."
107,00:06:03.70,00:06:03.70,"Convince them. >> All right, fellas,"
108,00:06:06.43,00:06:06.43,this is what it comes down to. We all know we're all deserving.
109,00:06:10.53,00:06:10.53,We've all been kicked in the face.
110,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,"And I'm telling you right now, there's no better way to kick"
111,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,those ass ... back in the face
112,00:06:17.10,00:06:17.10,than by putting a sweet little girl in there to do it for you.
113,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,"( laughing ) You put me in there,"
114,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,and I'll bring the Outcasts straight to the top
115,00:06:24.37,00:06:24.37,"where we should be. >> PROBST: Ryan, your job now"
116,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,is to convince them that you're the man.
117,00:06:31.37,00:06:31.37,">> Uh, you guys know how much I love"
118,00:06:34.87,00:06:34.87,"this game, and, uh, you guys know how much heart"
119,00:06:38.17,00:06:38.17,I have for the game. Give me a chance
120,00:06:40.37,00:06:40.37,"to carry the torch, so to speak, into the game and, uh..."
121,00:06:43.97,00:06:43.97,and bring the victory to one of us.
122,00:06:47.83,00:06:47.83,">> PROBST: Burton, why you? >> I'm about the most"
123,00:06:51.43,00:06:51.43,competitive person I know. And when I heard
124,00:06:54.33,00:06:54.33,"that there was a chance for two of us to go back in,"
125,00:06:57.43,00:06:57.43,"I swear to God, there was nothing"
126,00:06:59.40,00:06:59.40,I was going to do not to let that happen.
127,00:07:02.07,00:07:02.07,"And I'll also say that whoever else goes in there,"
128,00:07:04.40,00:07:04.40,"if I'm able to go in, you have my word"
129,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,"in front of everyone here, I will never lie to you"
130,00:07:09.93,00:07:09.93,in this game. Never.
131,00:07:12.40,00:07:12.40,>> PROBST: All right. Time to find out who's going
132,00:07:15.17,00:07:15.17,back into this game. Here's how the voting will work.
133,00:07:17.73,00:07:17.73,One at a time you will go up. You will be voting
134,00:07:20.90,00:07:20.90,for two separate people on two separate pieces
135,00:07:23.37,00:07:23.37,of parchment. You are voting people you want
136,00:07:27.00,00:07:27.00,back in this game. You cannot vote for yourself.
137,00:07:29.80,00:07:29.80,"Ryan, you're first. >> Lill, I would never"
138,00:07:52.10,00:07:52.10,put your name down unless it was for something good.
139,00:07:54.60,00:07:54.60,"If it's not me, I hope it's you. >> Burton, I'm voting you back"
140,00:08:09.37,00:08:09.37,in because I know you can win the individual immunities.
141,00:08:11.87,00:08:11.87,"And if I can't win, I want another Outcast member to win."
142,00:08:31.60,00:08:31.60,">> Ryan, you were my friend from the very beginning."
143,00:08:36.13,00:08:36.13,You accepted me no matter what. And I want you in almost as much
144,00:08:40.37,00:08:40.37,as I want to be in. And I hope we can be together.
145,00:08:43.67,00:08:43.67,"Thank you. >> Nicole, I know you're one bad"
146,00:09:10.60,00:09:10.60,bitch and I know you'll go and get them.
147,00:09:19.50,00:09:19.50,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
148,00:09:34.73,00:09:34.73,"I know you're excited. I'll remind you, the voting"
149,00:09:38.27,00:09:38.27,is a little different tonight. You want to see your name.
150,00:09:40.73,00:09:40.73,Two tribe members who have the most votes
151,00:09:43.60,00:09:43.60,go back into the game. I'll read the votes.
152,00:09:50.50,00:09:50.50,First vote... Burton.
153,00:09:57.30,00:09:57.30,"Lill. One vote Lill, one vote Burton."
154,00:10:02.33,00:10:02.33,Burton. That's two votes Burton.
155,00:10:06.10,00:10:06.10,"Lill. Two votes Lill,"
156,00:10:10.10,00:10:10.10,two votes Burton. Michelle.

170,00:11:09.60,00:11:09.60,">> Thank you, guys. >> Congratulations."
171,00:11:12.37,00:11:12.37,>> I'll make you proud. >> PROBST: Second person going
172,00:11:15.97,00:11:15.97,"back into the game... >> ( gasps ): Oh, my God!"
173,00:11:21.80,00:11:21.80,>> PROBST: Lill. ( clapping )
174,00:11:24.23,00:11:24.23,">> I am a nice person. >>Congratulations, Lill."
175,00:11:28.30,00:11:28.30,">> Oh, my God.  Oh, baby."
176,00:11:31.60,00:11:31.60,"Oh, my God. >> These guys are going down."
177,00:11:35.17,00:11:35.17,">> My heart. >> PROBST: Lill,"
178,00:11:37.93,00:11:37.93,"Burton, grab your torches. Get fire."
179,00:11:42.23,00:11:42.23,"As always, fire represents life in this game."
180,00:11:45.43,00:11:45.43,You now have fire again. You are back in this game.
181,00:11:52.57,00:11:52.57,"Michelle, Nicole, Trish, Ryan, you've put your"
182,00:11:56.13,00:11:56.13,faith in these two to carry on for the Outcasts.
183,00:12:00.57,00:12:00.57,"For the last time, it's time for you to go."
184,00:12:03.27,00:12:03.27,Michelle. Nicole.
185,00:12:09.23,00:12:09.23,Trish. Ryan.
186,00:12:20.27,00:12:20.27,"We have one member of Morgan, one from Drake."
187,00:12:23.87,00:12:23.87,"The only question now is. are you going to a new tribe,"
188,00:12:26.40,00:12:26.40,or are you going back to your old tribe?
189,00:12:29.87,00:12:29.87,"Let's find out. In here is one Drake buff,"
190,00:12:32.47,00:12:32.47,one Morgan buff. You guys need
191,00:12:34.20,00:12:34.20,to decide who's gonna reach in here and determine
192,00:12:36.63,00:12:36.63,the fate for both of you. I'll do it.
193,00:12:39.07,00:12:39.07,>> Get the Drake buff. >> PROBST: Take it back
194,00:12:43.60,00:12:43.60,"with you. >> Oh, God, help me."

201,00:13:01.53,00:13:01.53,into these tribes again. That's why you'll be immune
202,00:13:03.80,00:13:03.80,from the vote at the next Tribal Council.
203,00:13:05.87,00:13:05.87,Give you a few days to find your new way.
204,00:13:07.93,00:13:07.93,Head back to camp. ( thunder booming )

209,00:13:45.63,00:13:45.63,"in the game was Burton. I was like,"

211,00:13:50.67,00:13:50.67,will he be pissed off at everybody?

215,00:13:59.37,00:13:59.37,We'll see them in the morning. >> Never in a million years
216,00:14:07.60,00:14:07.60,would I have expected a chance to get back in the
217,00:14:10.07,00:14:10.07,"game, so I'm pretty excited right now."
218,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33,I don't know. I'm sure there's gonna be
219,00:14:14.20,00:14:14.20,a lot of mixed emotions. I'm sure there's gonna be a lot
220,00:14:17.03,00:14:17.03,"of resentment on their part. From my standpoint,"
221,00:14:18.90,00:14:18.90,"they all kicked me out. So, yeah, there's"
222,00:14:20.93,00:14:20.93,"gonna be some, uh, some making up to do"
223,00:14:23.53,00:14:23.53,on both ends. Are you guys asleep?
224,00:14:28.50,00:14:28.50,>> Hey. What do you think?
225,00:14:31.87,00:14:31.87,">> What's up, Rupert? >> Amazingly enough,"
226,00:14:34.67,00:14:34.67,"Burton shows up in a good mood, happy to be here,"
227,00:14:39.23,00:14:39.23,full of enthusiasm and life and just pumped Drake
228,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,"back up-- bang, immediately. >> Welcome back, Burton."
229,00:14:45.70,00:14:45.70,">> Welcome back, Burton. >> Thank you."
230,00:14:47.97,00:14:47.97,"It's good to see you guys. >> If you're hungry,"
231,00:14:50.33,00:14:50.33,"there's lentils. >> Oh, beautiful."
232,00:14:53.40,00:14:53.40,"Beautiful. >> We're sorry, Burton."
233,00:14:55.73,00:14:55.73,>> And then the apologies started.

236,00:15:03.10,00:15:03.10,I'm back and I'm happy about it. >> That's what we wanted
237,00:15:06.33,00:15:06.33,"to hear, and you know what? We're glad he's here,"
238,00:15:08.97,00:15:08.97,because he's so strong. We're gonna go further.
239,00:15:12.00,00:15:12.00,>> We can't be beat. >> We definitely traded up.
240,00:15:15.90,00:15:15.90,">> Yeah, I'm part of the Drake Tribe-- again,"
241,00:15:18.40,00:15:18.40,but I can't forget the fact that they did vote me off.
242,00:15:21.07,00:15:21.07,"So, I don't know if they're just kissing my ass,"
243,00:15:23.70,00:15:23.70,or if they really are happy to see me.
244,00:15:25.73,00:15:25.73,"because, in the end, it's a game about deceit."
245,00:15:45.70,00:15:45.70,>> Let's go get our new tribe mate.
246,00:15:50.53,00:15:50.53,">> Who's that? >> It's me, I'm sorry."
247,00:15:53.40,00:15:53.40,">> Hi, Lill. >> Welcome home, Lill."
248,00:15:55.43,00:15:55.43,>> I heard a female's voice getting off the boat
249,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,"and I didn't know who it was, and then,"
250,00:15:59.87,00:15:59.87,"when I took a glimmer and looked, it was Lill--"
251,00:16:02.40,00:16:02.40,"I could tell by her hat. I was like, ""Lill!"""
252,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,">> I told you at Tribal Council, we loved you."
253,00:16:06.53,00:16:06.53,>> I'm going to try again. I'm going to try to make you
254,00:16:09.10,00:16:09.10,"proud of me again. I arrived on the beach,"
255,00:16:11.27,00:16:11.27,"jumped out. ""Lill?! Lill, is that you?"
256,00:16:13.87,00:16:13.87,"""Oh, we are so glad it's you. We were afraid"
257,00:16:16.57,00:16:16.57,"it was somebody else."" I'm thinking, ""Whatever."""
258,00:16:20.30,00:16:20.30,">> When we lost you, it hurt. >> You better believe that."
259,00:16:23.87,00:16:23.87,>> We lost a family member. We welcomed Lill with open arms.
260,00:16:27.67,00:16:27.67,I don't know if she bought any of that.
261,00:16:30.07,00:16:30.07,I don't think she trusts me at all because I was
262,00:16:32.53,00:16:32.53,partially responsible for voting her out.
263,00:16:35.20,00:16:35.20,"We love you, Lill, you know that."
264,00:16:37.20,00:16:37.20,">> Well, I appreciate that, but, I just didn't feel like I"
265,00:16:40.43,00:16:40.43,was really a part of a group. I just didn't fit in.
266,00:16:45.70,00:16:45.70,"They are welcoming me, but they voted me off."
267,00:16:51.63,00:16:51.63,"I approached Andrew before, the first nine days I was on."
268,00:16:55.37,00:16:55.37,"He said to me, he would get back to me"
269,00:16:57.87,00:16:57.87,about Tribal Council. But when it came down
270,00:17:01.00,00:17:01.00,"to the voting, he never did get back to me,"
271,00:17:04.33,00:17:04.33,which just causes hard feelings and resentment.
272,00:17:06.97,00:17:06.97,>> This is by far the worst night we've been out here.
273,00:17:23.40,00:17:23.40,">> It's good to have you back, man."
274,00:17:25.97,00:17:25.97,>> It's good to be back. >> Can I ask you a couple
275,00:17:29.90,00:17:29.90,questions? >> Sure.
276,00:17:31.80,00:17:31.80,>> Away from all of these guys? >> Yeah.
277,00:17:34.83,00:17:34.83,>> Come here. >> Rupert pulled me aside
278,00:17:37.73,00:17:37.73,"right away, so I thought, ""Oh, this is"
279,00:17:41.27,00:17:41.27,"either going to go good, or it's going to go bad."""
280,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,I didn't know what to expect. >> Got to look me in the eye.
281,00:17:47.23,00:17:47.23,>> All right. >> I'll tell you my reason.
282,00:17:50.33,00:17:50.33,"I wanted to look him in the eye and say, ""This is why"
283,00:17:53.20,00:17:53.20,"I agreed to vote you out."" You laughed at me in my dress"
284,00:17:56.40,00:17:56.40,"and made me feel bad. You, you..."
285,00:17:58.60,00:17:58.60,"I heard you say something about a big kid in a sandbox,"
286,00:18:03.23,00:18:03.23,laughing at me about my plumber's crack.
287,00:18:05.93,00:18:05.93,I didn't like the way that he treated me
288,00:18:08.27,00:18:08.27,"in the start of this game, and that hurt me and I wanted"
289,00:18:11.27,00:18:11.27,him to know that that hurt me. You took that road
290,00:18:15.30,00:18:15.30,that every jock in my life has taken.
291,00:18:18.07,00:18:18.07,I was beneath you guys. I heard you guys
292,00:18:21.20,00:18:21.20,laugh and joke about me. I heard you guys...
293,00:18:23.43,00:18:23.43,"I portray a very strong and independent person,"
294,00:18:26.30,00:18:26.30,"but, in my head, I'm that fat little terrified"
295,00:18:30.80,00:18:30.80,kid that was picked on in school all his life.
296,00:18:33.73,00:18:33.73,And I saw Burton being those son of a bitches
297,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13,"that would make fun of me. >> Well, I wish you would have"
298,00:18:39.20,00:18:39.20,said something to me. And I feel awful.
299,00:18:41.50,00:18:41.50,I have a lot of respect for Rupert.
300,00:18:43.97,00:18:43.97,I hurt his feelings and I felt bad.
301,00:18:46.17,00:18:46.17,"I felt really bad. Well, I apologize for"
302,00:18:48.43,00:18:48.43,"that, I honestly do, because I had no intention"
303,00:18:50.43,00:18:50.43,of making you feel weird. >> You made me feel
304,00:18:52.50,00:18:52.50,"like I was getting used, so... >> Well, I apologize for that."
305,00:18:55.80,00:18:55.80,">> Within two minutes of talking, all fears were"
306,00:18:58.67,00:18:58.67,"subsided, all hesitation was gone-- everything was good."
307,00:19:03.13,00:19:03.13,">> If, if we go to next Tribal, what would happen?"
308,00:19:05.50,00:19:05.50,">> Jon's out. Guaranteed. >> All of a sudden, Rupert"
309,00:19:09.00,00:19:09.00,"said, ""If there's a Drake to go, it's going to be"
310,00:19:11.70,00:19:11.70,"Jon first,"" and... I about fainted."
311,00:19:14.07,00:19:14.07,I could not believe it. >> He wrote my name down
312,00:19:16.93,00:19:16.93,on the 18th day. >> He wrote my name down
313,00:19:19.67,00:19:19.67,on the 12th day. >> I'm writing his name down
314,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,the next time we go to Tribal Council.
315,00:19:24.43,00:19:24.43,">> You are sure it would not be me again,"
316,00:19:27.20,00:19:27.20,it would be Jon? >> Jon. He's out.
317,00:19:29.47,00:19:29.47,Then it's down to you and me and Chris and Sandra.
318,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,">> For me, it was a second chance at life in this game."
319,00:19:34.93,00:19:34.93,Good to see you on this side. >> It's good to have you back.
320,00:19:37.73,00:19:37.73,We're gonna be a stronger team now.
321,00:19:39.73,00:19:39.73,">> Oh, yeah. >> Well, I've been away"
322,00:19:53.27,00:19:53.27,"for nine days, and I come back and the Morgan Tribe..."
323,00:19:57.60,00:19:57.60,"needs some help, some serious help."
324,00:20:03.87,00:20:03.87,I went and got water. I've been collecting firewood.
325,00:20:07.30,00:20:07.30,I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else
326,00:20:10.47,00:20:10.47,"to help them with. These people,"
327,00:20:11.87,00:20:11.87,they have no energy. They have nothing.
328,00:20:15.53,00:20:15.53,"I mean, they are just... they're becoming"
329,00:20:17.73,00:20:17.73,like dead weight. >> At the next
330,00:20:22.87,00:20:22.87,"Immunity Challenge, you can't be voted out."
331,00:20:25.53,00:20:25.53,"You get a bye. If we lose, you know, one of us,"
332,00:20:30.23,00:20:30.23,"one of the four, are going home, and you're not going anywhere."
333,00:20:35.37,00:20:35.37,">> I have immunity for the first Tribal Council,"
334,00:20:38.40,00:20:38.40,"and I feel like I've got somewhat of a second chance,"
335,00:20:42.23,00:20:42.23,and... they resent it. >> We killed ourselves
336,00:20:45.03,00:20:45.03,"to make it five-five, so we go into the merge even."
337,00:20:49.70,00:20:49.70,And then we go yesterday to the reward challenge
338,00:20:52.13,00:20:52.13,and this happens. We're like...
339,00:20:57.20,00:20:57.20,"""What the hell?"" I woke up this morning"
340,00:21:01.90,00:21:01.90,really angry. I almost had to pinch myself.
341,00:21:03.80,00:21:03.80,"""Is this real? ""Am I hallucinating?"
342,00:21:05.30,00:21:05.30,"This is day 20. Why the hell is Lill here?"""
343,00:21:08.70,00:21:08.70,"Nice new buff, though. >> Oh, yeah."
344,00:21:11.60,00:21:11.60,That's okay. We welcome the curveballs.
345,00:21:14.20,00:21:14.20,Bring them on. Let's see where
346,00:21:15.80,00:21:15.80,we're going to go next. >> It's clearing up some.
347,00:21:19.53,00:21:19.53,I'm trying to fit in again. I'm trying to find
348,00:21:22.90,00:21:22.90,my niche again. I've learned that
349,00:21:24.87,00:21:24.87,this is a game. And I want to stay in
350,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,as long as I can. >> What is it?
351,00:21:43.20,00:21:43.20,>> It looks like an orange. >> It smells like a lemon.
352,00:21:45.30,00:21:45.30,>> Tangerine. >> I think it...
353,00:21:47.37,00:21:47.37,I think it's lemon. >> They found a lemon tree
354,00:21:49.30,00:21:49.30,"since I've been gone, which is great news to me."
355,00:21:51.47,00:21:51.47,It's almost like I'm starting over from scratch.
356,00:21:53.80,00:21:53.80,"There's all these new things. Christa, you want"
357,00:21:55.50,00:21:55.50,to run down there? >> Sure.
358,00:21:57.40,00:21:57.40,">> So, uh, we're going to go find this lemon tree,"
359,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,get some more lemons. >> Jon wants me to stay with
360,00:22:01.83,00:22:01.83,him and help him out. >> He needs help cooking.
361,00:22:03.90,00:22:03.90,>> Okay. >> We'll be back.
362,00:22:05.90,00:22:05.90,">> Yeah, we'll be right back. Jon did not want us"
363,00:22:11.27,00:22:11.27,all four to go. >> Yeah.
364,00:22:14.07,00:22:14.07,>> He's paranoid. >> He thinks he's
365,00:22:15.73,00:22:15.73,"the next one to go. >> Well, he should be paranoid."
366,00:22:17.93,00:22:17.93,">> The thing is, I have this philosophy that we need to"
367,00:22:21.30,00:22:21.30,tell each other the truth. And he has done nothing but lie
368,00:22:24.03,00:22:24.03,all of the time. >> Right.
369,00:22:26.10,00:22:26.10,">> There's the lime trees. >> Oh, my God, look at that."
370,00:22:28.47,00:22:28.47,">> My lying's done with, 'cause if we're all lying to each other"
371,00:22:31.97,00:22:31.97,and screwing each other over... >> Right.
372,00:22:34.13,00:22:34.13,>> ...the Morgans are going to end up winning the thing.
373,00:22:36.83,00:22:36.83,The conversation we had was kind of a confirmation of
374,00:22:39.13,00:22:39.13,"""I want you guys to know I'm honest."
375,00:22:40.93,00:22:40.93,"""I'm not going to play any games."
376,00:22:43.03,00:22:43.03,"I'm not going to be deceitful."" >> I say screw Jon."
377,00:22:45.27,00:22:45.27,Because he's the one that's going to be
378,00:22:47.27,00:22:47.27,trying to play 500 games at the same time.
379,00:22:49.37,00:22:49.37,"And if we ever have a merge, he's going to go over to Morgan"
380,00:22:52.77,00:22:52.77,and try to play with all those people.
381,00:22:54.63,00:22:54.63,"I was trying to figure out, if there ever was a merge"
382,00:22:57.37,00:22:57.37,"with the Morgan Tribe, what could happen."
383,00:22:59.40,00:22:59.40,"I thought, ""Jon gets on a lot of people's nerves"
384,00:23:01.73,00:23:01.73,"real quickly."" >> They're not gonna take him."
385,00:23:03.70,00:23:03.70,They're not gonna believe him. They're not gonna trust him.
386,00:23:05.77,00:23:05.77,">> Hold on-- the only thing, though: If the Morgans"
387,00:23:07.90,00:23:07.90,"need him, they might take him. >> Right."
388,00:23:10.10,00:23:10.10,">> Not because they like him, but because they don't"
389,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,have a choice. >> Right.
390,00:23:25.77,00:23:25.77,>> We are making rice this morning. Uh...
391,00:23:27.90,00:23:27.90,">> Our last rice. >> We only have, I think,"
392,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,one serving of rice left. So...
393,00:23:35.23,00:23:35.23,>> That's it. ( whispers ): That's it.
394,00:23:39.77,00:23:39.77,">> Oh, gosh, that's it. >> Food, as of this morning,"
395,00:23:49.97,00:23:49.97,definitely shifted from critical to dire.
396,00:23:52.80,00:23:52.80,"It's terrifying. Frankly, I don't know"
397,00:23:55.00,00:23:55.00,what we'll do. >> We're suffering.
398,00:23:58.30,00:23:58.30,"Rice was the one staple that was consistent for us,"
399,00:24:01.33,00:24:01.33,"kept our energy up, and we don't have it now, and"
400,00:24:03.70,00:24:03.70,I don't know how that will play a factor in our performance
401,00:24:06.17,00:24:06.17,when we have challenges. We'll have to see.
402,00:24:12.57,00:24:12.57,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Drake and Morgan each getting"
403,00:24:18.97,00:24:18.97,their first look at the new tribes.
404,00:24:21.50,00:24:21.50,Let's talk about how you guys are doing 21 days in.
405,00:24:24.47,00:24:24.47,"Sandra, what's the food issue like?"
406,00:24:27.30,00:24:27.30,>> There is no food issues. Um... this morning we had
407,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,"rice and corn. Yesterday, we ate about"
408,00:24:31.93,00:24:31.93,"12, 15 pounds of fish. Um, then we had some"
409,00:24:35.27,00:24:35.27,"refried beans at night, and everyone went"
410,00:24:36.90,00:24:36.90,"to sleep with full tummies. >> PROBST: Now, I haven't been"
411,00:24:39.43,00:24:39.43,"to Morgan's beach, but I'm looking at Savage."
412,00:24:41.27,00:24:41.27,I'm gathering you guys aren't doing as well?
413,00:24:42.97,00:24:42.97,">> Actually, we just... we don't have any food."
414,00:24:45.33,00:24:45.33,"We're surviving right now on mussels and, uh, coconut."
415,00:24:49.13,00:24:49.13,Did any of you guys come here today expecting a merge?
416,00:24:51.63,00:24:51.63,Were you counting on that to save you?
417,00:24:53.47,00:24:53.47,">> No. Uh, honestly, I have not expected a merge."
418,00:24:56.23,00:24:56.23,I don't expect some big buffet under some table.
419,00:24:58.83,00:24:58.83,">> PROBST: Once again, the game changes when you least expect"
420,00:25:01.73,00:25:01.73,it. Drop your buffs.
421,00:25:04.07,00:25:04.07,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: We're merging."
422,00:25:06.53,00:25:06.53,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: Drop them at your"
423,00:25:08.93,00:25:08.93,"feet. Drake is no more,"
424,00:25:11.03,00:25:11.03,Morgan is no more. You are one tribe.
425,00:25:14.30,00:25:14.30,">> And they're black, baby. Yeah!"
426,00:25:16.63,00:25:16.63,">> Thank you. >> Oh, my God."
427,00:25:23.13,00:25:23.13,Give me a hug. ( sighs )
428,00:25:26.70,00:25:26.70,">> PROBST: So, here's how it works-- you'll come up"
429,00:25:29.03,00:25:29.03,"with a new tribe name, paint a new tribe flag."
430,00:25:31.23,00:25:31.23,"Based on what I just heard, you're going to be living"
431,00:25:34.20,00:25:34.20,"on Drake's beach. From this point forward,"
432,00:25:36.20,00:25:36.20,all challenges are individual. That means all rewards
433,00:25:38.40,00:25:38.40,"are won by an individual, and immunity is won"
434,00:25:41.87,00:25:41.87,"by an individual. So, I'll take that back."
435,00:25:46.73,00:25:46.73,"Tribal immunity, no more. This is now what you covet."
436,00:25:52.70,00:25:52.70,>> Ah... >> PROBST: And it's what you're
437,00:25:54.70,00:25:54.70,playing for today-- individual immunity.
438,00:25:57.60,00:25:57.60,Ready to hear about the challenge?
439,00:25:59.57,00:25:59.57,>> Yeah. >> Yep.
440,00:26:01.60,00:26:01.60,>> PROBST: Today's challenge is based on a pirate punishment
441,00:26:03.80,00:26:03.80,called keel hauling. A pirate who'd been bad was tied
442,00:26:06.57,00:26:06.57,to a rope and dragged underneath the boat.
443,00:26:08.47,00:26:08.47,"If the sharks didn't get you, the barnacles would certainly"
444,00:26:10.53,00:26:10.53,"cut you up, and you had to hold your breath the entire time."
445,00:26:13.57,00:26:13.57,Today's challenge is based on the same principle.
446,00:26:15.80,00:26:15.80,"You will jump into the ocean, swim underneath a platform"
447,00:26:18.63,00:26:18.63,by pulling yourself along a rope.
448,00:26:20.17,00:26:20.17,You got to hold your breath the entire time.
449,00:26:22.27,00:26:22.27,"If you come up in the middle, you start over."
450,00:26:24.37,00:26:24.37,"When you get to the end, you'll reach a ladder."
451,00:26:26.57,00:26:26.57,Climb up and race back to the start.
452,00:26:28.30,00:26:28.30,We will run two heats. First two to complete two laps

457,00:26:47.00,00:26:47.00,The top two finishers move on to the final.
458,00:26:49.53,00:26:49.53,"First heat is Tijuana, Christa, Rupert, Jon and Sandra."

463,00:27:13.73,00:27:13.73,"Move, move, move, T. Let's go, Sandra, don't give up."
464,00:27:18.17,00:27:18.17,>> Oh... I'm the only one? Ooh!

510,00:30:49.87,00:30:49.87,I know you want to be. Very interesting dynamic now.
511,00:30:53.50,00:30:53.50,You already have immunity as a result of
512,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,the resurrection vote. You now win

516,00:31:04.37,00:31:04.37,at tonight's Tribal Council. You have this afternoon
517,00:31:06.43,00:31:06.43,to think about it. You can head back to camp
518,00:31:08.53,00:31:08.53,in your new boat. Take this with you and bring it
519,00:31:11.27,00:31:11.27,"to future challenges. Hey, one more thing, guys."
520,00:31:14.23,00:31:14.23,"Savage, that buffet you referred to?"

552,00:33:12.40,00:33:12.40,out who goes first. We're thinking Little Jon.
553,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,We can't stand Little Jon. He's arrogant.

573,00:34:20.30,00:34:20.30,I have to think that maybe he's on the up-and-up.
574,00:34:22.97,00:34:22.97,>> Did y'all talk to Lill? >> Uh-uh.
575,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,>> What is she doing? >> I have no idea.
576,00:34:27.20,00:34:27.20,">> We've seen Lill and Burton talking a lot,"
577,00:34:30.50,00:34:30.50,so they could have something going on.
578,00:34:32.53,00:34:32.53,"And, if Lill goes to the bad guys,"
579,00:34:34.53,00:34:34.53,we're in serious trouble. Do you want to vote
580,00:34:36.57,00:34:36.57,with the Morgans? >> I don't know.
581,00:34:39.93,00:34:39.93,>> It's important to us. >> You guys are ready
582,00:34:42.57,00:34:42.57,to ditch me off again. >> What are you talking about?
583,00:34:45.97,00:34:45.97,>> The same people are still there that voted me off.
584,00:34:49.70,00:34:49.70,You... you can't tell me that you'd have put me
585,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,before the other three people. You guys would have
586,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,ditched me in a minute if we stayed as Morgans.
587,00:34:59.07,00:34:59.07,I had immunity. >> And you don't think they
588,00:35:01.30,00:35:01.30,would? You don't think they would?
589,00:35:03.37,00:35:03.37,"Oh, please. >> I don't know."
590,00:35:05.43,00:35:05.43,I don't know. >> That's very naive.
591,00:35:07.47,00:35:07.47,You're being... >> I have not totally
592,00:35:09.60,00:35:09.60,"decided yet, and I... and that's all I can say now."
593,00:35:12.13,00:35:12.13,I have not totally decided yet. >> Will you let me know before?
594,00:35:14.77,00:35:14.77,">> Remember, I asked you to let me know before,"
595,00:35:17.47,00:35:17.47,and you didn't? I don't know.
596,00:35:20.70,00:35:20.70,I have to decide before I get there though.
597,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,I am in a whirlwind right now. I just... You don't know
598,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,which way to turn. They're all offering friendship.
599,00:35:30.47,00:35:30.47,"Whether or not I can trust all this, I can't really say."
600,00:35:34.60,00:35:34.60,">> I think we go after Savage. If he's the head over there, we"
601,00:35:38.70,00:35:38.70,chop the head off. >> I know Andrew feels
602,00:35:40.97,00:35:40.97,as if he's close to being on the cutting block
603,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,"because I think the Drake Tribe, they want to vote out the"
604,00:35:46.73,00:35:46.73,"strongest on the Morgan side. And, definitely, the swing vote"
605,00:35:48.87,00:35:48.87,tonight could be Lill. She could potentially go
606,00:35:51.07,00:35:51.07,with Morgan or Drake. >> PROBST: Welcome.
607,00:36:10.77,00:36:10.77,"First thing I need to ask... T, what was the reaction today"
608,00:36:14.37,00:36:14.37,when you guys heard there was going to be a merge?
609,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,">> Shocked. Um, because it is a"
610,00:36:19.70,00:36:19.70,"merge that can be of a benefit, but it also can hurt us all."
611,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"Overall, I'm looking at it in an optimistic view,"
612,00:36:26.70,00:36:26.70,but it... it was a shock. It was a shock.
613,00:36:30.03,00:36:30.03,">> PROBST: Lill, you go back to Morgan, you're there"
614,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,"for a day, and then, suddenly, you merge."
615,00:36:34.53,00:36:34.53,How are you feeling about everything?
616,00:36:36.97,00:36:36.97,>> I am thrilled. I'm thrilled with the merger.
617,00:36:39.87,00:36:39.87,I'm ready for it. I'm just glad that
618,00:36:43.07,00:36:43.07,"I now have a larger family. >> PROBST: Ryno, you still"
619,00:36:46.40,00:36:46.40,"have 18 days left in the game. Now you're one big tribe,"
620,00:36:49.27,00:36:49.27,and it is an individual game. So how do you vote
621,00:36:51.80,00:36:51.80,"from this point forward? >> Yeah, it... it's hard for me"
622,00:36:54.20,00:36:54.20,"right now. I... I'm looking at everybody,"
623,00:36:56.47,00:36:56.47,and I... I don't know them well enough to write their name
624,00:37:00.13,00:37:00.13,"down, but I don't know. I mean, the feast"
625,00:37:03.37,00:37:03.37,"was so great today, and then coming here,"
626,00:37:05.87,00:37:05.87,"it's, like, it sucks. >> PROBST: Here's how"
627,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,the individual immunity works in terms of assigning
628,00:37:12.43,00:37:12.43,it to someone. It's a little unusual tonight.
629,00:37:15.87,00:37:15.87,"Lill and Burton, as a result of resurrecting themselves back"
630,00:37:19.37,00:37:19.37,"into this game, were given immunity simply to give"
631,00:37:22.63,00:37:22.63,them a chance to reintegrate back into this game.
632,00:37:25.30,00:37:25.30,Burton then goes and wins individual immunity today.
633,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,"That immunity is assignable, meaning you can give"
634,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,it to somebody else here tonight and protect them.
635,00:37:34.40,00:37:34.40,"Typically, that would make you, yourself, vulnerable."
636,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"Tonight, you won't be. You have nothing to lose"
637,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,"by giving it to somebody. So, Burton, do you want to give"
638,00:37:43.03,00:37:43.03,that immunity to anybody? I've done a lot of thinking
639,00:37:45.30,00:37:45.30,"about it and, uh... it is quite an unusual"
640,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"situation, and I do believe I will pass this immunity on."
641,00:37:56.37,00:37:56.37,"Such a close fight, I couldn't not give it to you."
642,00:38:03.13,00:38:03.13,There are now three people you cannot vote for tonight.
643,00:38:05.53,00:38:05.53,"You cannot vote for Lill, you cannot vote"
644,00:38:08.13,00:38:08.13,"for Burton and, now, you cannot vote"
645,00:38:10.40,00:38:10.40,for Rupert as well. Time to vote.
646,00:38:14.03,00:38:14.03,"Savage, you're up. >> Little Jon, you talk too much"
647,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,"smack. >> Ooh, yeah, Mr. Macho..."
648,00:38:40.77,00:38:40.77,Mr. Savage... going down.
649,00:38:43.77,00:38:43.77,Dig it? >> You're our biggest
650,00:39:00.53,00:39:00.53,threat out here. Bye.
651,00:39:12.73,00:39:12.73,">> Jonny Fairplay, this message goes for you."
652,00:39:15.67,00:39:15.67,You're a troublemaker and you're very manipulative.
653,00:39:40.13,00:39:40.13,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
654,00:39:55.03,00:39:55.03,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
655,00:39:57.23,00:39:57.23,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
656,00:39:59.73,00:39:59.73,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
657,00:40:04.63,00:40:04.63,First vote: Jon.
658,00:40:10.43,00:40:10.43,"Savage. One vote Andrew,"
659,00:40:12.77,00:40:12.77,one vote Jon. Savage.
660,00:40:17.83,00:40:17.83,"Two votes Savage, one vote Jon."
661,00:40:22.53,00:40:22.53,"Three votes Andrew, one vote Jon."
662,00:40:28.03,00:40:28.03,"Four votes Andrew, one vote Jon."
663,00:40:32.43,00:40:32.43,"Five votes Savage, one vote Jon."
664,00:40:40.27,00:40:40.27,"Jon. Two votes Jon,"
665,00:40:44.07,00:40:44.07,five votes Andrew. Jon.
666,00:40:48.63,00:40:48.63,Three votes Jon. Jon.
667,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,"Four votes Jon, five votes Andrew."
668,00:41:02.80,00:41:02.80,Seventh person voted out of the tribe:
669,00:41:06.73,00:41:06.73,Andrew. Need to bring me your torch.
670,00:41:17.60,00:41:17.60,"Andrew, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
671,00:41:24.77,00:41:24.77,">> Ryno, D, T, hang tough. >> PROBST: You've survived 21"
672,00:41:42.20,00:41:42.20,"days. At the very least, you will"
673,00:41:44.63,00:41:44.63,"be a member of the jury. You still have 18 days left,"
674,00:41:47.23,00:41:47.23,"so I suggest you head back to camp,"
675,00:41:49.23,00:41:49.23,"get up tomorrow, and get to work."
676,00:41:51.20,00:41:51.20,"Good night, guys. Stay tuned for scenes"
677,00:42:12.27,00:42:12.27,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:
678,00:42:19.10,00:42:19.10,"Life after the merge is rocky. >> I think the Morgan Tribe is,"
679,00:42:21.80,00:42:21.80,"just in general, very lazy. >> They work more than"
680,00:42:23.97,00:42:23.97,what is necessary. >> PROBST: Tribal alliances
681,00:42:26.60,00:42:26.60,fall apart. >> Take Rupert out?
682,00:42:28.60,00:42:28.60,We're crazy if we don't. >> What if we got rid of Burton
683,00:42:31.20,00:42:31.20,and kept the two females around? >> PROBST: And the food fights
684,00:42:33.50,00:42:33.50,back. ( Lill screams )
