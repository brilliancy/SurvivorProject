211,00:13:40.33,00:13:40.33,TRIBAL AND THROUGH THE PAST FEW VOTES.
212,00:13:42.20,00:13:42.20,THOSE ARE MY ALLIES. I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND
213,00:13:45.13,00:13:45.13,KEEP THEM CLOSE. >> WOW!

217,00:14:14.03,00:14:14.03,WHOA MY GOSH YOU'RE SO -- SO CLOSE!
218,00:14:17.80,00:14:17.80,>> JUSTICE AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.
219,00:14:22.50,00:14:22.50,HE IS TRULY INCREDIBLE. HE'S 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME
220,00:14:26.87,00:14:26.87,BUT WITHIN HIM IS SO MUCH MATURITY AND LIFE AND
221,00:14:33.00,00:14:33.00,LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT. >> THIS IS 39 DAYS.
222,00:14:37.23,00:14:37.23,"IT'S GONE BUY IN A BLINK, I HAVEN'T REALLY MISSED MALCOLM."
223,00:14:40.67,00:14:40.67,"(LAUGHTER) >> MILES, MY LITTLE BROTHER"
224,00:14:42.27,00:14:42.27,TURNED 21 YEARS OLD A MONTH AGO. HE'S A KNUCKLEHEAD IN A REALLY
225,00:14:45.10,00:14:45.10,NICE -- LIKE A NICE WAY. HE'S JUST KIND OF A CLOWN.
226,00:14:47.77,00:14:47.77,>> I WAS SITTING THERE WITH MY SHIRT UP TOUCHING MY NIP UNTIL
227,00:14:50.93,00:14:50.93,THIS MIDDLE OF THIS BAR. >> HE'S ALWAYS AROUND TRYING TO
228,00:14:53.13,00:14:53.13,GET A LAUGH. HE WANTS TO BE THE CENTER OF
229,00:14:55.93,00:14:55.93,ATTENTION. OUT HERE WHEN I'M THIS CLOSE TO
230,00:14:57.63,00:14:57.63,A MILLION DOLLARS HIM RUNNING HIS MOUTH COULD COST ME.
231,00:15:02.53,00:15:02.53,>> I WANT TO CLIMB UP. YOU WANT TO GO UP?
232,00:15:04.30,00:15:04.30,>> ABSOLUTELY. >> GET TWO GOOD FOOTHOLDS.
233,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,HERE'S THE HACKER. >> SO CLOSE.
234,00:15:14.70,00:15:14.70,SO CLOSE. >> ONE HACK AWAY.
235,00:15:15.90,00:15:15.90,">> COME ON, FINISH IT. >> OH!"
236,00:15:19.90,00:15:19.90,">> OW! >> YOU OKAY, MAN?"
237,00:15:21.70,00:15:21.70,>> HE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE HIS DAD.
238,00:15:23.93,00:15:23.93,">> MY SON IS BLOODYD FROM HERE TO HERE, HIS CHEST, EVERYBODY'S"
239,00:15:29.27,00:15:29.27,"LIKE ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" AND I'M LIKE ""THAT'S MY BOY."""
240,00:15:33.10,00:15:33.10,>> WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU INTO SOME SALT WATER.
241,00:15:35.70,00:15:35.70,>> SHE HAS AN EXTRA SET OF EYES AND EARS HERE.
242,00:15:39.03,00:15:39.03,IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF INTEL I CAN GATHER.
243,00:15:43.60,00:15:43.60,">> THAT'S AWESOME, I LOVE THAT. >> I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW I CAN"
244,00:15:46.87,00:15:46.87,HELP YOU OUT. >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
245,00:15:48.70,00:15:48.70,BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A VERY STRONG FOUR ALLIANCE:
246,00:15:51.70,00:15:51.70,"MALCOLM, DENICE, MICHAEL AND ME. BUT I DON'T WANT MALCOLM IN THE"
247,00:15:57.03,00:15:57.03,FINAL THREE BECAUSE HE WOULD PROBABLY WIN IT.
248,00:15:58.73,00:15:58.73,>> I'M NOT SURPRISED LISA MADE IT THIS FAR.
249,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,I LOOK UP TO HER FOR A REASON. SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO SAY THE
250,00:16:03.97,00:16:03.97,RIGHT THING. SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO DO THE RIGHT
251,00:16:05.97,00:16:05.97,THING. SHE'S A REALLY GOOD GAME PLAYER.
252,00:16:08.73,00:16:08.73,"SHE'S SUPERSMART, VERY BRIGHT, SHE KNOWS HOW TO WIN."
253,00:16:11.07,00:16:11.07,>> I ORCHESTRATED THIS BLIND SIDE OF MALCOLM RIGHT AFTER THE
254,00:16:15.53,00:16:15.53,MERGE. HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.
255,00:16:16.77,00:16:16.77,WE WERE SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR MICHAEL SKUPIN.
256,00:16:21.47,00:16:21.47,I FOUND MALCOLM'S HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN HIS BACK.
257,00:16:24.30,00:16:24.30,>> DID YOU TELL ANYBODY? >> I TOLD MALCOLM THAT I FOUND
258,00:16:28.17,00:16:28.17,IT. >> THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.
259,00:16:29.03,00:16:29.03,>> I'VE BEEN TOO NICE. >> AND A MISTAKE.
260,00:16:31.30,00:16:31.30,>> AND A MISTAKE! (LAUGHS)
261,00:16:33.50,00:16:33.50,I KNOW. I KNOW.
262,00:16:36.97,00:16:36.97,"I'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES OUT HERE, JUSTICE."
263,00:16:39.87,00:16:39.87,"IF I WERE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, WOULD I BETRAY PEOPLE,"
264,00:16:44.30,00:16:44.30,"HURT PEOPLE, NOT TELL THE TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW."
265,00:16:48.47,00:16:48.47,BECAUSE IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY IN MY HEAD IT'S JUST A GAME AND
266,00:16:52.03,00:16:52.03,REALLY PLAY THE GAME AND I COULD HAVE PLAYED A GREAT GAME AND I
267,00:16:55.10,00:16:55.10,CAME OUT HERE STRONG. >> Jeff: .
268,00:16:57.20,00:16:57.20,>> YOU WERE ALL ABOUT THE GAME WHEN YOU LEFT.
269,00:16:59.40,00:16:59.40,>> I KNOW. I KNOW.
270,00:17:01.07,00:17:01.07,>> MY SISTER IS A VERY LOYAL PERSON SO ANYTHING SHADY OR
271,00:17:04.10,00:17:04.10,UNDERHANDED WOULD BE SO UNNATURAL FOR HER TO BEHAVE LIKE
272,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,THAT. I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
273,00:17:10.37,00:17:10.37,"LIKE, MALCOLM'S A THREAT, MAN. >> MY JOB IS TO REMIND MY SISTER"
274,00:17:13.90,00:17:13.90,"TO THINK OF THIS AS A GAME: OUTWIT, OUTLAST, OUTPLAY THE"
275,00:17:18.20,00:17:18.20,OTHER CONTESTANTS. >> YOU KNOW WORRYING THAT GOOD
276,00:17:23.10,00:17:23.10,BECAUSE OUR FOUR-PERSON ALLIANCE IS VERY TIGHT.
277,00:17:25.10,00:17:25.10,EVEN THOUGH MALCOLM HAS AN IDOL. HE CAN ONLY PLAY IT TOMORROW
278,00:17:27.87,00:17:27.87,NIGHT OR THE NEXT NIGHT. >> SO HE'S -- DO YOU THINK HE'S
279,00:17:30.67,00:17:30.67,GOING TO PLAY IT? >> WE'VE STUCK TO OUR WORD EVERY
280,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,TIME. IT WOULD BE DUMB OF HIM TO PLAY
281,00:17:37.13,00:17:37.13,IT. >> WHY DON'T YOU VOTE OUT
282,00:17:38.63,00:17:38.63,MALCOLM THEN? >> WOULDN'T THAT BE CRAZY.
283,00:17:41.43,00:17:41.43,CARTER WOULD JOIN US WHERE WE COULD HAVE A THREE-PERSON
284,00:17:44.43,00:17:44.43,"ALLIANCE WITH LISA, I, AND CARTER WE COULD TAKE MALCOLM OUT"
285,00:17:47.97,00:17:47.97,AND AN IDOL AT ONE TIME AND BLIND SIDE HIM.
286,00:17:50.43,00:17:50.43,WE COULD DO THAT. >> THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT:
287,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,"I TRIED TO MAKE THAT BIG PLAY AND AFTER THAT IT BLEW UP,"
288,00:17:56.37,00:17:56.37,MESSED ME UP. >> IT DIDN'T BLOW YOU UP.
289,00:17:58.93,00:17:58.93,IT GOT US HERE. >> I DO KNOW IT'S A GAME AND I
290,00:18:03.17,00:18:03.17,LOVE THIS GAME. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STEP
291,00:18:06.57,00:18:06.57,OUTSIDE OF WHO I AM OUTSIDE THE GAME TO PLAY THE GAME.
292,00:18:13.27,00:18:13.27,">> IF ABI, MICHAEL AND YOU AND CARTER ALL VOTED MALCOLM, WOULD"
293,00:18:18.43,00:18:18.43,THAT BE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LEAVE? >> YES.
294,00:18:21.03,00:18:21.03,">> OKAY, HELP EXPLAIN TO ME WHY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS"
295,00:18:23.93,00:18:23.93,OPPORTUNITY TO GET MALCOLM OUT WOULD BE --
296,00:18:25.80,00:18:25.80,>> BECAUSE I GAVE MALCOLM MY WORD.
297,00:18:28.40,00:18:28.40,>> SO THAT'S THE DECISION? >> YES.
298,00:18:30.33,00:18:30.33,>> HOLDING ON TO YOUR WORD? >> YES.
299,00:18:33.07,00:18:33.07,I KNEW THAT YOU HAD TO LIE TO PLAY THIS GAME.
300,00:18:35.43,00:18:35.43,I KNEW IT WAS PART OF THE GAME AND THAT EVERYBODY SIGNED UP
301,00:18:38.77,00:18:38.77,KNEW THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR WORD.
302,00:18:40.87,00:18:40.87,>> EVEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY BETRAYED MALCOLM ALREADY HE WAS
303,00:18:43.33,00:18:43.33,"LIKE ""IT'S COOL. IT'S A GAME"" RIGHT?"
304,00:18:46.60,00:18:46.60,SO HE MIGHT EVEN RESPECT THAT IN THE END THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO
305,00:18:51.93,00:18:51.93,THAT. >> WHEN SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ME IS
306,00:18:55.27,00:18:55.27,ABLE TO REMIND ME OF THE CRYSTAL CLEAR PICTURE THAT I'VE GOTTEN
307,00:19:02.67,00:19:02.67,"ALL CONFUSED AND BEFUDDLED AND FOGGY, IT WAS LIKE YEAH!"
308,00:19:12.37,00:19:12.37,I CAN PLAY THIS GAME! I CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND I CAN
309,00:19:16.67,00:19:16.67,"PLAY IT WELL! >> HEY, GUYS!"
310,00:19:20.67,00:19:20.67,>> HOW'S THIS? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR
311,00:19:23.37,00:19:23.37,LOVELY EVENING? OUR LIVING ROOM?
312,00:19:24.83,00:19:24.83,>> UNBELIEVABLE. >> MY BROTHER HAS COME IN HERE
313,00:19:28.33,00:19:28.33,"WITH SOME FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND HE SAID, LISA, WHAT ARE YOU"
314,00:19:35.23,00:19:35.23,"DOING? YOU, MICHAEL, CARTER, ABI, BLIND"
315,00:19:38.57,00:19:38.57,SIDE MALCOLM. GET HIM OUT OF THERE.
316,00:19:41.10,00:19:41.10,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, MICHAEL? >> I LOVE FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND"
317,00:19:45.20,00:19:45.20,I LOVE FINAL THREE. >> I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL WIN BUT
318,00:19:47.87,00:19:47.87,I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PLAY THE GAME BY THESE RULES
319,00:19:52.20,00:19:52.20,TO WIN. HAVE THIS TIME WITH MY BROTHER.
320,00:20:20.23,00:20:20.23,"BLESS ME, BLESS ABI AND CARTER AS WE FINISH THESE DAYS, GIVE US"
321,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,"ALL STRENGTH. LORD, WE DON'T PROPOSE TO GUESS"
322,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,YOUR WILL AS MUCH ASK WE ASK THAT YOU WOULD BLESS THIS PLAN
323,00:20:32.63,00:20:32.63,AND PROTECT IT AND IF YOU WANT MALCOLM TO WIN OR CARTER OR
324,00:20:37.73,00:20:37.73,"DENICE OR EVEN ABI, WE WANT ULTIMATELY YOUR WILL TO BE DONE."
325,00:20:47.30,00:20:47.30,>> I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO BOND OF JESUS.
326,00:20:49.73,00:20:49.73,>> THEY ARE GOING TO BOND OVER JESUS.
327,00:20:52.20,00:20:52.20,>> I COULD HAVE GUESSED THAT IF I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
328,00:20:54.03,00:20:54.03,>> YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO KICK ASS AT THE CHALLENGES.
329,00:20:59.37,00:20:59.37,IMMUNITY. >> ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEARS I
330,00:21:01.57,00:21:01.57,HAVE AFTER HAVING THE LOVED ONES HERE IS LISA.
331,00:21:04.87,00:21:04.87,SHE WAS AT ROCK BOTTOM EMOTIONALLY AND WAS PLAYING WITH
332,00:21:07.47,00:21:07.47,"HER HEART, AS SHE LIKES TO SAY. AND I'M AFRAID THAT HER BROTHER,"
333,00:21:10.60,00:21:10.60,WHO SEEMS LIKE A VERY LEVEL-HEADED INTELLIGENT GUY
334,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,MIGHT HAVE SNAPPED HER BACK TO HER SENSES AND GOT HER THINKING
335,00:21:17.33,00:21:17.33,ABOUT WHO SHE NEEDS TO BE SITTING NEXT TO IN THAT FINAL
336,00:21:19.73,00:21:19.73,THREE TO HAVE A SHOT OF WINNING. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT JESUS

341,00:21:38.97,00:21:38.97,I DON'T THINK GOD CHOOSES SIDES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PRAY FOR
342,00:21:41.73,00:21:41.73,YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM AND BECAUSE YOU'RE PRAYING GOD IS GOING TO
343,00:21:44.37,00:21:44.37,CHOOSE THAT SIDE. I THINK HE'S SO MUCH BIGGER THAN
344,00:21:46.97,00:21:46.97,"THAT. MALCOLM, NICE TO MEET YOU, MAN."
345,00:21:48.57,00:21:48.57,>> IT WAS A PLEASURE. >> I HAD THOSE AND MAYBE THE

349,00:22:00.83,00:22:00.83,WE'D TOTALLY TRUST THAT. HE'S A WIN-WIN GOD.
350,00:22:03.57,00:22:03.57,MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY WINS THE MILLION DOLLARS.
351,00:22:05.77,00:22:05.77,(LAUGHS) BUT HE'S PRETTY RESOURCEFUL.

362,00:23:01.80,00:23:01.80,YOU'LL DROP IT IN WATER AND USE THE HOOK TO RETRIEVE THREE BAGS.
363,00:23:05.20,00:23:05.20,"ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS, YOU'LL RACE TO THE FINISH AND"
364,00:23:08.40,00:23:08.40,USE THE ROPE AND STICKS INSIDE THE BAG TO FASHION A POLE.
365,00:23:11.87,00:23:11.87,ONCE THE POLE IS LONG ENOUGH YOU WILL USE IT TO HIT A TARGET

550,00:34:29.27,00:34:29.27,ENOUGH EVERYONE STARTS TO BELIEVE IT AND I'M CONVINCED IN
551,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30,MY OWN LIE. EVEN I AM BELIEVING MYSELF RIGHT
552,00:34:34.53,00:34:34.53,NOW. (LAUGHS)
553,00:34:37.77,00:34:37.77,>> ABI CONTINUES TO THREATEN THAT SHE HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
554,00:34:41.47,00:34:41.47,IDOL. I THINK SHE'S OBNOXIOUS BUT EVEN

561,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80,"BEING ABI IS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE, CUT AND DRY."
562,00:35:07.97,00:35:07.97,IF ABI GOES HOME TONIGHT IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A BITCH.
563,00:35:30.37,00:35:30.37,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
564,00:35:35.23,00:35:35.23,"R.C., JEFF, ARTIS, KEITH AND PENNER VOTED OUT AT THE LAST"

566,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,YOU REALLY NEEDED IMMUNITY TODAY OR WERE SAFE EITHER WAY?

568,00:35:55.63,00:35:55.63,I TRUST THEM COMPLETELY. I REALLY DID FEEL SAFE BUT THAT
569,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT EXCITED TO HAVE IT FINALLY.
570,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40,>> Jeff: REMIND ME WHO THE GROUP OF FOUR IS.
571,00:36:03.23,00:36:03.23,">> MYSELF, DENICE, SKUPIN AND LISA."

574,00:36:12.73,00:36:12.73,"BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND, ESPECIALLY WHEN"
575,00:36:15.60,00:36:15.60,THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT TAKING THE PERSON THAT YOU FEEL
576,00:36:18.43,00:36:18.43,DESERVES IT OVER THE PERSON THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN BEAT.
577,00:36:21.20,00:36:21.20,SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE PLAYED A GAME WORTHY ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN
578,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,TONIGHT TO THE FINAL FIVE AND GIVEN A CHANCE TO FIGHT ANOTHER
579,00:36:30.03,00:36:30.03,DAY. BECAUSE I DESERVE IT.

581,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,"SAYING LISTEN, PLAY THE GAME WITH PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO BE"
582,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,THERE. >> I DON'T KNOW IF CARTER'S MORE
583,00:36:42.23,00:36:42.23,OF A SON TO ME OR MORE OF A FRIEND TO ME BUT WE CLICK VERY
584,00:36:46.03,00:36:46.03,WELL TOGETHER. TO EVEN CONSIDER CARTER IT'S
585,00:36:48.40,00:36:48.40,ALMOST LIKE VOTING OFF MY OWN KID.
586,00:36:50.50,00:36:50.50,"TO EVEN CONSIDER IT. >> Jeff: WHO YOU CALLED ""THE"
587,00:36:53.83,00:36:53.83,"GREATEST HUMAN BEING"" YOU KNOW. >> ALMOST LIKE VOTING OFF MY OWN"

589,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,CHOOSE TONIGHT I'M GOING TO SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY THAT I THINK
590,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,DESERVES TO BE THERE OR I CAN SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY THAT I'M
591,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,"PRETTY SURE I CAN BEAT, WHICH WAY DO YOU SIT NOW AT THIS POINT"
592,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,IN THE GAME? >> I WOULD SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY
593,00:37:11.83,00:37:11.83,"I THINK I CAN BEAT. YES, I WOULD LIKE TO BE NOBLER"
594,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,"THAN THAT, BUT WHY MAKE IT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE TO?"
595,00:37:21.73,00:37:21.73,">> Jeff: ABI, SURPRISED THAT IT'S EVEN A CONSIDERATION THAT"
596,00:37:24.47,00:37:24.47,"YOU WON'T BE GOING HOME TONIGHT? >> YEAH, I'M SURPRISED."
597,00:37:28.27,00:37:28.27,BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK I HAVE A HUGE TOOL TONIGHT.
598,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,I FOUND THE FOURTH HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
599,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20,SO I'M GOING TO PLAY IT AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GO HOME
600,00:37:39.90,00:37:39.90,TONIGHT. >> Jeff: IS THIS NEW
601,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,"INFORMATION OR SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT, DENICE?"
602,00:37:43.53,00:37:43.53,">> NONE OF JUST SEEN IT, NONE OF US HAVE SEEN ANY CLUES SO THE"
603,00:37:46.77,00:37:46.77,ONLY THING WE CAN GO ON IS WHAT ABI'S SHARING WITH US.
604,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,">> Jeff: MALCOLM, DOES IT HELP ABI'S GAME OR HURT IT BY NOT"
605,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,SHOWINSHOWINSHOWING THIS IDOL? >> WE'VE SEEN ABI PLAY FOR A
606,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,LONG TIME WITH AN IDOL AND I THINK SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
607,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,IF SHE HAS IT SHE SHOULD BE LEVERAGING IT MORE THAN SHE IS.
608,00:38:02.50,00:38:02.50,>> I'M JUST VERY PROTECTIVE OF MYSELF AT THIS POINT AFTER
609,00:38:05.87,00:38:05.87,HEARING THAT I'M THE MOST UNLIKABLE PERSON ON THE TRIBE.
610,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,">> Jeff: DENICE, HOW'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ABI?"
611,00:38:13.90,00:38:13.90,>> IT'S -- I THINK THE TENSION IS STILL THERE.
612,00:38:17.30,00:38:17.30,BUT IT'S IMPROVED. THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST THAT I CAN
613,00:38:21.33,00:38:21.33,SAY. >> Jeff: SO HAS IT IMPROVED SO
614,00:38:22.90,00:38:22.90,"MUCH THAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE HER DIFFERENTLY AND MIGHT SAY, ""YOU"
615,00:38:26.07,00:38:26.07,"KNOW WHAT? YOU DESERVE TO GO TO THE END""?"
616,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20,>> MY -- PROBABLY NOT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE CHANGING
617,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,MY ENTIRE STRATEGY THAT I HAD COMING INTO THE GAME.
618,00:38:35.60,00:38:35.60,"SO NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT HAS CHANGED."
619,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,">> Jeff: WHY DOES THAT MAKE YOU LAUGH, ABI?"
620,00:38:40.40,00:38:40.40,THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT.
621,00:38:42.57,00:38:42.57,">> IT'S HORRIBLE NEWS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK I'M"
622,00:38:46.37,00:38:46.37,BRINGING ANY TENSION. SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH
623,00:38:48.73,00:38:48.73,WHAT I JUST HEARD. >> Jeff: MAYBE A BETTER WORD
624,00:38:50.80,00:38:50.80,"IS ""BAGGAGE."" >> I AM BAGGAGE?"
625,00:38:54.93,00:38:54.93,">> Jeff: NO, NOT YOU. BUT THE PAST 30 DAYS."
626,00:38:57.90,00:38:57.90,">> OH, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, YEAH. YEAH."
627,00:39:00.40,00:39:00.40,"MAYBE THERE IS BAGGAGE. I GUESS, YEAH."
628,00:39:02.90,00:39:02.90,">> Jeff: DENICE, DO YOU THINK ABI CAN WIN THIS GAME IF SHE"
629,00:39:05.77,00:39:05.77,GETS TO THE END? >> I DON'T THINK SHE CAN WIN
630,00:39:07.83,00:39:07.83,THIS GAME. IF SOMEBODY'S LOOKING IN THE
631,00:39:09.77,00:39:09.77,"SPIRIT OF ""SURVIVOR,"" THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE OF A BALANCED"
632,00:39:12.63,00:39:12.63,"GAME BETWEEN THE SOCIAL, THE STRATEGIC, THE PHYSICAL AND I"
633,00:39:16.37,00:39:16.37,DON'T THINK THAT ABI'S BROUGHT THOSE FULLY TO THE TABLE.
634,00:39:22.83,00:39:22.83,">> Jeff: WELL, THE SIX OF YOU HAVE SURVIVED 33 DAYS IN THIS"
635,00:39:26.57,00:39:26.57,GAME. ONE OF YOU WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE
636,00:39:28.90,00:39:28.90,DAY 34. IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
637,00:39:31.90,00:39:31.90,"CARTER, YOU'RE UP. I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES."
638,00:40:16.57,00:40:16.57,IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW
639,00:40:19.67,00:40:19.67,WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO. OKAY.
640,00:40:27.37,00:40:27.37,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
641,00:40:29.70,00:40:29.70,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
642,00:40:33.07,00:40:33.07,IMMEDIATELY. I'LL READ THE VOTES.
643,00:40:36.30,00:40:36.30,"FIRST VOTE, CARTER. ABI."

650,00:41:27.37,00:41:27.37,SMALLER THE NUMBERS GET THE MORE DIFFICULT THE GAME BECOMES.
651,00:41:30.93,00:41:30.93,"GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO CAMP."
652,00:41:32.93,00:41:32.93,GOOD NIGHT. >> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

655,00:42:02.07,00:42:02.07,>> Jeff: INFORMATION FROM AN UNLIKELY ALLY.
656,00:42:03.73,00:42:03.73,>> I THINK THIS ALLIANCE OF FOUR YOU ARE TOTALLY ON THE BOTTOM.
657,00:42:07.23,00:42:07.23,>> Jeff: -- COULD FORCE LISA TO MAKE HER BIGGEST MOVE YET.
658,00:42:09.90,00:42:09.90,>> IF WE KEEP ABI I HAVE OPTIONS.
659,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,MAYBE TAKE TO THE END. USE HER FOR MY BEST GAME PLAN.
660,00:42:20.37,00:42:20.37,">> THE REALIZATION THAT MY ""SURVIVOR"" EXPERIENCE IS OVER IS"
661,00:42:25.60,00:42:25.60,WEIGHING HEAVILY ON ME. IT DOES HURT TO KNOW THAT THAT
662,00:42:28.60,00:42:28.60,FOUR WOULD RATHER PLAY WITH SOMEONE LIKE ABI WHO THEY FEEL
663,00:42:32.07,00:42:32.07,LIKE THEY CAN BEAT THESE NEXT FEW DAYS AS OPPOSED TO ME.
664,00:42:34.67,00:42:34.67,"I CAN UNDERSTAND IT, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T HURT."
665,00:42:36.97,00:42:36.97,THEY'RE PLAYING WITH THEIR HEADS NOT THEIR HEARTS AT THIS POINT.
