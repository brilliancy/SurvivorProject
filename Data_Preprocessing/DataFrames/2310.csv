475,00:20:36.30,00:20:36.30,WE HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE FOR
476,00:20:37.57,00:20:37.57,SURE.
477,00:20:38.97,00:20:38.97,BUT I HAVEN'T LOST HOPE.
478,00:20:40.97,00:20:40.97,JEFF SAID TRIBAL COUNCIL THERE
479,00:20:41.93,00:20:41.93,WILL BE A TWIST.
480,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,SO I THINK IF THIS ISN'T THE
481,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87,TIME TO GET UP BECAUSE ANYTHING

489,00:21:22.60,00:21:22.60,AGILITY CAME BACK TO HAUNT ME.
490,00:21:26.00,00:21:26.00,IT WAS DEFINITELY DAWN AND
491,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,WHITNEY.
492,00:21:29.03,00:21:29.03,THING IS THAT IF DAWN GETS TO

500,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,TO GO.
501,00:21:44.10,00:21:44.10,UNFORTUNATELY WHEN JEFF

506,00:21:50.57,00:21:50.57,THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY
507,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,THAT AFTER WE VOTE OUT ONE OF
508,00:21:53.10,00:21:53.10,THE TWO THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
509,00:21:54.70,00:21:54.70,IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IF ONE OFTHE

512,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,SO I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
513,00:22:06.87,00:22:06.87,WE NEEDED TO WIN THAT.
514,00:22:09.83,00:22:09.83,SO MAD AT MYSELF.
515,00:22:13.90,00:22:13.90,I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ME.
516,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,I HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE
517,00:22:18.37,00:22:18.37,"TODAY, THERE WASN'T ANY WAY"
518,00:22:20.33,00:22:20.33,AROUND IT.

525,00:22:31.97,00:22:31.97,GAME IS YOU CAN LAY IN BED AND
526,00:22:33.63,00:22:33.63,"THINK, I'M GOING HOME."
527,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,AND WHOLE DAY CHANGES.
528,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33,THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

595,00:25:25.20,00:25:25.20,BECAUSE I SAVED THAT ENTIRE
596,00:25:26.80,00:25:26.80,TRIBE.
597,00:25:26.97,00:25:26.97,IF THEY THINK THAT EDNA IS A
598,00:25:28.47,00:25:28.47,MORE VALUABLE PLAYER FOR THEM
599,00:25:29.67,00:25:29.67,SOMEBODY WHO MADE MORE

609,00:25:54.87,00:25:54.87,AGAIN THEN SOMETHING I HAVE TO
610,00:25:56.20,00:25:56.20,CONSIDER.
611,00:25:56.37,00:25:56.37,HOW ARE WE DOING?

623,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40,IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
624,00:26:18.70,00:26:18.70,WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS

644,00:26:59.83,00:26:59.83,IT'S FRICKIN' SURVIVOR.
645,00:27:00.73,00:27:00.73,ALBERT IS TRYING TO TAKE
646,00:27:02.43,00:27:02.43,CONTROL OF THIS GAME AND I'MTHE
647,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,SWING VOTE.
648,00:27:06.07,00:27:06.07,SO NOW I'M DEBATING WHETHER TO
649,00:27:08.37,00:27:08.37,STICK WITH COACH OR GO WITH
650,00:27:10.10,00:27:10.10,ALBERT'S CRAZY PLAN.
651,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,IN THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A
652,00:27:12.57,00:27:12.57,QUESTION OF WHAT WILL TAKE METO
653,00:27:14.00,00:27:14.00,THE END.
654,00:27:23.63,00:27:23.63,I THINK COACH IS GETTING
655,00:27:25.77,00:27:25.77,SUSPICIOUS.
656,00:27:26.00,00:27:26.00,THAT WORRIES ME.
657,00:27:27.00,00:27:27.00,ALBERT RIGHT NOW IS PLAYING

659,00:27:30.67,00:27:30.67,GAME TO PLAY.
660,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27,"SEE HIM TALKING TO WHITNEY,"
661,00:27:33.63,00:27:33.63,"DAWN, EITHER TRYING TO COME UP"
662,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,WITH A PLAN OR TRYING TO CURRY
663,00:27:37.10,00:27:37.10,JURY VOTES.
664,00:27:37.70,00:27:37.70,NEITHER ONE IS ACCEPTABLE IN MY
665,00:27:40.00,00:27:40.00,OPINION.
666,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GO OVER
667,00:27:45.80,00:27:45.80,FIVE IT'S INSTANT DEATH.

671,00:27:52.70,00:27:52.70,SO I FEEL AT THE MOMENT LIKE AN
672,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,OLD MOB BOSS.
673,00:27:56.00,00:27:56.00,IF ANYBODY GOES AGAINST THE

805,00:31:46.53,00:31:46.53,SMILED AND ROLLED YOUR EYES.
806,00:31:47.50,00:31:47.50,DID I?
807,00:31:49.53,00:31:49.53,"WELL, I JUST SEE A LOT OF --"
808,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,JUST OBSERVING THINGS LIKE

810,00:31:57.83,00:31:57.83,COACH.
811,00:31:58.03,00:31:58.03,SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT WOULD BE
812,00:32:00.10,00:32:00.10,THE POSITION HE'S IN THERE.
813,00:32:02.27,00:32:02.27,IF THEY'RE ALWAYS REPORTINGBACK
814,00:32:03.37,00:32:03.37,"THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO ASSUME,"
815,00:32:05.20,00:32:05.20,RIGHT?
816,00:32:05.37,00:32:05.37,Jeff: DOES THAT SURPRISE
817,00:32:07.00,00:32:07.00,THAT YOU SHE OBSERVED THAT
818,00:32:08.77,00:32:08.77,EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO COACH.
819,00:32:09.80,00:32:09.80,"NO, DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT"
820,00:32:12.10,00:32:12.10,ALL.
821,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,IT'S BEEN WIDELY INTERPRETED
822,00:32:13.37,00:32:13.37,THAT COACH IS LEADER BY A LOTOF
823,00:32:16.07,00:32:16.07,THE MEMBERS --
824,00:32:16.73,00:32:16.73,Jeff: IS HE YOUR LEADER?
825,00:32:18.33,00:32:18.33,I DON'T THINK HE IS MY
826,00:32:19.73,00:32:19.73,LEADER OR THIS LEADER OF THIS
827,00:32:20.90,00:32:20.90,GROUP OR ALLIANCE MIGHT JUST BE
828,00:32:22.27,00:32:22.27,A FIGUREHEAD WHO REPRESENTSLEAD
829,00:32:23.77,00:32:23.77,ARE SHIP TO THE GROUP OR MIGHT
830,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,BE PULLING THE REAL STRINGS.
831,00:32:26.73,00:32:26.73,IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE THAT
832,00:32:28.43,00:32:28.43,NATURAL CONNECTION FROM COACHTO
833,00:32:30.03,00:32:30.03,LEADER.

837,00:32:36.77,00:32:36.77,HEAR INFORMATION.
838,00:32:37.27,00:32:37.27,KNICKS IS THE BIGGEST POWER IN
839,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,THIS GAME.
840,00:32:39.37,00:32:39.37,WHEN PEOPLE GIVE ME INFORMATION
841,00:32:40.57,00:32:40.57,"I TAKE IT, I FILE IT AWAY."
842,00:32:42.60,00:32:42.60,I USE IT ONE DAY WHEN I THINK
