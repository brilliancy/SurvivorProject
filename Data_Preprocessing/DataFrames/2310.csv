470,00:20:24.03,00:20:24.03,"ALL RIGHT, GUYS, TONIGHT A TWIST"
471,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,OF TRIBAL COUNCIL WHICH WILL BE

475,00:20:36.13,00:20:36.13,OUT.
476,00:20:36.30,00:20:36.30,WE HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE FOR
477,00:20:37.57,00:20:37.57,SURE.
478,00:20:38.97,00:20:38.97,BUT I HAVEN'T LOST HOPE.
479,00:20:40.97,00:20:40.97,JEFF SAID TRIBAL COUNCIL THERE
480,00:20:41.93,00:20:41.93,WILL BE A TWIST.
481,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,SO I THINK IF THIS ISN'T THE
482,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87,TIME TO GET UP BECAUSE ANYTHING
483,00:20:46.13,00:20:46.13,CAN HAPPEN.

488,00:21:19.13,00:21:19.13,CHANCE I WOULD EXCEL.
489,00:21:20.83,00:21:20.83,AGAIN MY LACK OF BALANCE AND
490,00:21:22.60,00:21:22.60,AGILITY CAME BACK TO HAUNT ME.
491,00:21:26.00,00:21:26.00,IT WAS DEFINITELY DAWN AND
492,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,WHITNEY.
493,00:21:29.03,00:21:29.03,THING IS THAT IF DAWN GETS TO
494,00:21:30.97,00:21:30.97,THE END OF THIS GAME SHE'LL WIN.
495,00:21:32.07,00:21:32.07,NO QUESTION.
496,00:21:32.70,00:21:32.70,THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO GET
497,00:21:34.57,00:21:34.57,HER OFF SOONER THAN LATER.
498,00:21:37.80,00:21:37.80,LUCKILY DAWN AND WHITNEY ARE IN
499,00:21:39.30,00:21:39.30,SUCH A BAD POSITION RIGHT NOW.
500,00:21:41.57,00:21:41.57,THEY KNOW THEY'RE THE NEXT TWO
501,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,TO GO.
502,00:21:44.10,00:21:44.10,UNFORTUNATELY WHEN JEFF
503,00:21:44.83,00:21:44.83,MENTIONED THERE WOULD BE A TWIST
504,00:21:46.77,00:21:46.77,AT TONAL'S TRIBAL COUNCIL MY
505,00:21:48.87,00:21:48.87,"FIRST THOUGHT, DOUBLE"
506,00:21:50.33,00:21:50.33,ELIMINATION.
507,00:21:50.57,00:21:50.57,THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY
508,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,THAT AFTER WE VOTE OUT ONE OF
509,00:21:53.10,00:21:53.10,THE TWO THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
510,00:21:54.70,00:21:54.70,IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IF ONE OF THE

513,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,SO I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
514,00:22:06.87,00:22:06.87,WE NEEDED TO WIN THAT.
515,00:22:09.83,00:22:09.83,SO MAD AT MYSELF.
516,00:22:13.90,00:22:13.90,I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ME.
517,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,I HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE
518,00:22:18.37,00:22:18.37,"TODAY, THERE WASN'T ANY WAY"
519,00:22:20.33,00:22:20.33,AROUND IT.
520,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,I'M MOST LIKELY GOING TO
521,00:22:22.70,00:22:22.70,REDEMPTION ISLAND TONIGHT.
522,00:22:25.57,00:22:25.57,THEY ARE SO ISSUE ABOUT THE --

525,00:22:30.40,00:22:30.40,I MEAN THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS
526,00:22:31.97,00:22:31.97,GAME IS YOU CAN LAY IN BED AND
527,00:22:33.63,00:22:33.63,"THINK, I'M GOING HOME."
528,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,AND WHOLE DAY CHANGES.
529,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33,THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
530,00:22:47.30,00:22:47.30,RIGHT NOW WE'D BE UP FOR
531,00:22:48.73,00:22:48.73,MAKING A MOVE.

533,00:22:53.07,00:22:53.07,BRANDON IS SUCH A LOOSE CANNON
534,00:22:54.43,00:22:54.43,THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
535,00:22:57.13,00:22:57.13,BELIEVE.

539,00:23:02.40,00:23:02.40,BUTT IT'S RIDICULOUS.
540,00:23:04.33,00:23:04.33,ALBERT AT LEAST SEEMS LIKE A
541,00:23:05.90,00:23:05.90,GOOD GUY.

550,00:23:24.77,00:23:24.77,TO WIN THIS GAME IS TO SECURE
551,00:23:29.80,00:23:29.80,EVERY SAVAII VOTE.

594,00:25:20.37,00:25:20.37,NOT EXACTLY SHOCKED BUT I FELT
595,00:25:23.60,00:25:23.60,COMPLETE BETRAYAL OF OUR TRUST
596,00:25:25.20,00:25:25.20,BECAUSE I SAVED THAT ENTIRE
597,00:25:26.80,00:25:26.80,TRIBE.
598,00:25:26.97,00:25:26.97,IF THEY THINK THAT EDNA IS A
599,00:25:28.47,00:25:28.47,MORE VALUABLE PLAYER FOR THEM
600,00:25:29.67,00:25:29.67,SOMEBODY WHO MADE MORE
601,00:25:30.80,00:25:30.80,SACRIFICES FOR THEM THEY'RE

604,00:25:45.00,00:25:45.00,IT'S ABOUT BIG MOVES.
605,00:25:46.10,00:25:46.10,I DIDN'T MAKE THE BIG JUMP I DID
606,00:25:48.33,00:25:48.33,TO BE VOTED OUT.
607,00:25:49.93,00:25:49.93,I WANTED TO MOVE FURTHER IN THIS
608,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,GAME.
609,00:25:52.67,00:25:52.67,IF THAT MEANS SLIPPING BACK
610,00:25:54.87,00:25:54.87,AGAIN THEN SOMETHING I HAVE TO
611,00:25:56.20,00:25:56.20,CONSIDER.
612,00:25:56.37,00:25:56.37,HOW ARE WE DOING?
613,00:25:57.60,00:25:57.60,DOING GOOD.

622,00:26:15.30,00:26:15.30,WE'RE NEVER GETTING HER
623,00:26:16.97,00:26:16.97,VOTE.
624,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40,IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
625,00:26:18.70,00:26:18.70,WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS
626,00:26:20.83,00:26:20.83,OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GOOD OF WHAT

646,00:27:00.73,00:27:00.73,ALBERT IS TRYING TO TAKE
647,00:27:02.43,00:27:02.43,CONTROL OF THIS GAME AND I'M THE
648,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,SWING VOTE.
649,00:27:06.07,00:27:06.07,SO NOW I'M DEBATING WHETHER TO
650,00:27:08.37,00:27:08.37,STICK WITH COACH OR GO WITH
651,00:27:10.10,00:27:10.10,ALBERT'S CRAZY PLAN.
652,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,IN THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A
653,00:27:12.57,00:27:12.57,QUESTION OF WHAT WILL TAKE ME TO
654,00:27:14.00,00:27:14.00,THE END.
655,00:27:23.63,00:27:23.63,I THINK COACH IS GETTING
656,00:27:25.77,00:27:25.77,SUSPICIOUS.
657,00:27:26.00,00:27:26.00,THAT WORRIES ME.
658,00:27:27.00,00:27:27.00,ALBERT RIGHT NOW IS PLAYING
659,00:27:29.57,00:27:29.57,FOR ALBERT THAT'S A DANGEROUS
660,00:27:30.67,00:27:30.67,GAME TO PLAY.
661,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27,"SEE HIM TALKING TO WHITNEY,"
662,00:27:33.63,00:27:33.63,"DAWN, EITHER TRYING TO COME UP"
663,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,WITH A PLAN OR TRYING TO CURRY
664,00:27:37.10,00:27:37.10,JURY VOTES.
665,00:27:37.70,00:27:37.70,NEITHER ONE IS ACCEPTABLE IN MY
666,00:27:40.00,00:27:40.00,OPINION.
667,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GO OVER
668,00:27:45.80,00:27:45.80,FIVE IT'S INSTANT DEATH.
669,00:27:46.90,00:27:46.90,THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF

671,00:27:51.00,00:27:51.00,"CODDLING, REAFFIRMING AND FEAR."
672,00:27:52.70,00:27:52.70,SO I FEEL AT THE MOMENT LIKE AN
673,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,OLD MOB BOSS.
674,00:27:56.00,00:27:56.00,IF ANYBODY GOES AGAINST THE
675,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,"FAMILY, THEY'RE DEAD."

777,00:30:59.33,00:30:59.33,GAME WHICH IS IN SUCH CONTROL

792,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,NOT RUNNING THIS THIS ALLIANCE
793,00:31:23.90,00:31:23.90,OR RUNNING THE SHOW BUT I'M
794,00:31:25.47,00:31:25.47,ALWAYS THINKING IN THE BACK OF
795,00:31:26.97,00:31:26.97,MY HEAD THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE
796,00:31:28.57,00:31:28.57,BIG MOVES IN ORDER TO GET
797,00:31:30.03,00:31:30.03,FURTHER IN THIS GAME.
798,00:31:31.03,00:31:31.03,"SO I WORRY, I STRESS, I BELIEVE,"
799,00:31:34.93,00:31:34.93,"I TRUST, ALL OF THOSE EMOTIONS"
800,00:31:37.23,00:31:37.23,ALL DAY LONG.
801,00:31:38.33,00:31:38.33,IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.
802,00:31:39.93,00:31:39.93,Jeff: WHITNEY.
803,00:31:41.40,00:31:41.40,WHEN COACH SAID CONTRARY TO
804,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,POPULAR BEE LEAVE I'M NOT THE
805,00:31:45.27,00:31:45.27,LEADER OF THIS TRIBE YOU KIND OF
806,00:31:46.53,00:31:46.53,SMILED AND ROLLED YOUR EYES.
807,00:31:47.50,00:31:47.50,DID I?
808,00:31:49.53,00:31:49.53,"WELL, I JUST SEE A LOT OF --"
809,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,JUST OBSERVING THINGS LIKE
810,00:31:54.93,00:31:54.93,EVERYBODY ALWAYS REPORTS BACK TO
811,00:31:57.83,00:31:57.83,COACH.
812,00:31:58.03,00:31:58.03,SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT WOULD BE
813,00:32:00.10,00:32:00.10,THE POSITION HE'S IN THERE.
814,00:32:02.27,00:32:02.27,IF THEY'RE ALWAYS REPORTING BACK
815,00:32:03.37,00:32:03.37,"THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO ASSUME,"
816,00:32:05.20,00:32:05.20,RIGHT?
817,00:32:05.37,00:32:05.37,Jeff: DOES THAT SURPRISE
818,00:32:07.00,00:32:07.00,THAT YOU SHE OBSERVED THAT
819,00:32:08.77,00:32:08.77,EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO COACH.
820,00:32:09.80,00:32:09.80,"NO, DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT"
821,00:32:12.10,00:32:12.10,ALL.
822,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,IT'S BEEN WIDELY INTERPRETED
823,00:32:13.37,00:32:13.37,THAT COACH IS LEADER BY A LOT OF
824,00:32:16.07,00:32:16.07,THE MEMBERS --
825,00:32:16.73,00:32:16.73,Jeff: IS HE YOUR LEADER?
826,00:32:18.33,00:32:18.33,I DON'T THINK HE IS MY
827,00:32:19.73,00:32:19.73,LEADER OR THIS LEADER OF THIS
828,00:32:20.90,00:32:20.90,GROUP OR ALLIANCE MIGHT JUST BE
829,00:32:22.27,00:32:22.27,A FIGUREHEAD WHO REPRESENTS LEAD
830,00:32:23.77,00:32:23.77,ARE SHIP TO THE GROUP OR MIGHT
831,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,BE PULLING THE REAL STRINGS.
832,00:32:26.73,00:32:26.73,IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE THAT
833,00:32:28.43,00:32:28.43,NATURAL CONNECTION FROM COACH TO
834,00:32:30.03,00:32:30.03,LEADER.
835,00:32:31.60,00:32:31.60,Jeff: COACH --
836,00:32:33.20,00:32:33.20,I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M A
837,00:32:35.30,00:32:35.30,LEADER BUT OBVIOUSLY I LIKE TO
838,00:32:36.77,00:32:36.77,HEAR INFORMATION.
839,00:32:37.27,00:32:37.27,KNICKS IS THE BIGGEST POWER IN
840,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,THIS GAME.
841,00:32:39.37,00:32:39.37,WHEN PEOPLE GIVE ME INFORMATION
842,00:32:40.57,00:32:40.57,"I TAKE IT, I FILE IT AWAY."
843,00:32:42.60,00:32:42.60,I USE IT ONE DAY WHEN I THINK
844,00:32:44.07,00:32:44.07,THAT MY LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY OUT
845,00:32:45.77,00:32:45.77,"HERE, WHICH THAT DAY IS COMING,"
846,00:32:48.80,00:32:48.80,"FAIRLY SOON, YES."
847,00:32:53.10,00:32:53.10,Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
848,00:32:53.80,00:32:53.80,IT IS TIME TO GET TO THE VOTE.

855,00:33:05.73,00:33:05.73,EVERYBODY IS FAIR GAME.
856,00:33:07.30,00:33:07.30,"BRANDON, YOU'RE UP."
857,00:33:44.83,00:33:44.83,Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
