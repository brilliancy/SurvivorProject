2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33,Shii Ann's eating habits didn't
4,00:00:05.27,00:00:05.27, sit well  with her Sook Jai tribe mates.
5,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37, ROBB:  She's
6,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,repulsive.
7,00:00:09.07,00:00:09.07,"SHII ANN: Culturally, it's not  an American thing to eat necks"
8,00:00:12.57,00:00:12.57," and hearts and gizzards.  In Taiwan,"
9,00:00:14.50,00:00:14.50,"it's considered a great, you know, snack."
10,00:00:16.93,00:00:16.93,Yech!
11,00:00:18.13,00:00:18.13,"PROBST: At Chuay Gahn,  Brian and Ted made a pact."
12,00:00:20.97,00:00:20.97,One of the things we... we've got to kind of do is
13,00:00:22.90,00:00:22.90,have each other's back.
14,00:00:24.43,00:00:24.43," He's confirmed that, yes,  he is totally committed"
15,00:00:26.60,00:00:26.60,to me all the way to the end.
16,00:00:27.80,00:00:27.80,-It's done. -It's done.
17,00:00:29.90,00:00:29.90,PROBST: Chuay Gahn experienced  a setback when
18,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27, their fishing net and boat  floated away into the night.
19,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43,-The boat's gone. -What?!
20,00:00:36.57,00:00:36.57, What do you mean
21,00:00:37.57,00:00:37.57,we lost the boat?! (groans)
22,00:00:39.67,00:00:39.67,"CLAY: If we don't find  that boat, just for,"
23,00:00:41.30,00:00:41.30," to make it easier  to go get water,"
24,00:00:42.80,00:00:42.80, I don't know what  we're gonna do.
25,00:00:47.87,00:00:47.87,PROBST: Chuay Gahn sucked it  up at the fish challenge
26,00:00:50.67,00:00:50.67, and won immunity.
27,00:00:51.80,00:00:51.80,-Chuay Gahn wins immunity! -(cheering)
28,00:00:55.10,00:00:55.10,"PROBST: Sook Jai went  to Tribal Council,"
29,00:00:57.03,00:00:57.03," and although Shii Ann  received two votes,"
30,00:00:59.50,00:00:59.50, Stephanie was voted  out of the tribe.
31,00:01:01.80,00:01:01.80,The tribe has spoken.
32,00:01:03.93,00:01:03.93, 11 are left.
33,00:01:05.93,00:01:05.93, Who will be the next to go?
34,00:02:30.87,00:02:30.87,"PENNY: I think in this game, you have to take it day by day."
35,00:02:34.43,00:02:34.43," Trust is something that  does shift, especially as"
36,00:02:37.90,00:02:37.90," you do get further  in the game, because"
37,00:02:40.20,00:02:40.20,we're all here for a million dollars.
38,00:02:42.00,00:02:42.00,ERIN: Time to separate reality from the game out here.
39,00:02:46.13,00:02:46.13,"ROBB: Yeah, it is. I'm having a little trouble with it."
40,00:02:48.63,00:02:48.63,'Cause I don't want to... I don't want to base my opinions
41,00:02:50.80,00:02:50.80,"of people about how they play this, and I know I'm going to."
42,00:02:53.83,00:02:53.83,"PENNY:  This morning when I got up,"
43,00:02:56.73,00:02:56.73," Robb said, ""Penny,  let me ask you a question."""
44,00:03:00.07,00:03:00.07,"He said, ""Were you ever planning on voting me out last night?"""
45,00:03:02.50,00:03:02.50,"And I said, ""Absolutely not, 100% never was I going"
46,00:03:05.73,00:03:05.73,"to write your name down last night."""
47,00:03:07.53,00:03:07.53," And he said, ""Well, you know,  that's kind of funny because"
48,00:03:10.60,00:03:10.60,"Ken said that you were going to vote for me or for Stephanie."""
49,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,"I don't know how much truth is being said, you know."
50,00:03:18.50,00:03:18.50,There's no reason to lie to me.
51,00:03:20.70,00:03:20.70,I don't like backstabbing bull ...
52,00:03:23.67,00:03:23.67,PENNY: So I think Robb  got very upset this morning
53,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23, thinking that maybe Ken
54,00:03:28.30,00:03:28.30,is playing two different sides.
55,00:03:30.03,00:03:30.03,"ROBB: Now I don't trust anybody,"
56,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,and Penny is telling me one thing.
57,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90,"So I'm not playing any games here, bro,"
58,00:03:35.97,00:03:35.97,"and I told you I've been straight up with you,"
59,00:03:38.80,00:03:38.80,so obviously... I don't know.
60,00:03:40.80,00:03:40.80,"I don't know when you guys were talking, or I don't even..."
61,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,"I don't even care. To be honest with you, I don't care."
62,00:03:46.37,00:03:46.37, I was questioning Ken's trust  and Ken's loyalty.
63,00:03:48.87,00:03:48.87," I didn't know if he was trying  to mix everything up, and"
64,00:03:51.23,00:03:51.23, I didn't know  what he was trying to achieve.
65,00:03:52.93,00:03:52.93,"So, I confronted him on it."
66,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,"You know what's bothering me? Straight up, I think"
67,00:03:57.00,00:03:57.00,you're playing a harder game than anyone here.
68,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,"-Oh, really? -Yeah, I do."
69,00:03:59.63,00:03:59.63,"Okay, so now, yesterday going in there,"
70,00:04:01.00,00:04:01.00,who did everybody else tell you to vote for?
71,00:04:03.07,00:04:03.07,"-Shii Ann. -Oh, okay."
72,00:04:04.80,00:04:04.80,-Who did everybody vote for? -Steph.
73,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,"Okay, who did I tell you I was voting for?"
74,00:04:09.23,00:04:09.23,Steph. Who did I vote for? Steph.
75,00:04:10.97,00:04:10.97,And now you got a problem with me
76,00:04:12.77,00:04:12.77,because I was honest with you?
77,00:04:14.13,00:04:14.13,"Yeah, I don't want to ... hear it, okay?"
78,00:04:16.13,00:04:16.13, I have no idea what  started that. I didn't know
79,00:04:18.60,00:04:18.60, for the first five minutes  that it was even
80,00:04:20.60,00:04:20.60, directed towards me.
81,00:04:21.73,00:04:21.73,And once I realized
82,00:04:22.73,00:04:22.73,"it was directed towards me, I thought he was kidding."
83,00:04:24.50,00:04:24.50,"What you just got finished doing is saying,"
84,00:04:26.30,00:04:26.30,"""You were the only one that was honest with me yesterday."
85,00:04:28.57,00:04:28.57,"You're playing a harder game than everybody."""
86,00:04:30.07,00:04:30.07,"Well, you know what?"
87,00:04:31.30,00:04:31.30,Don't ask me. That pisses me off.
88,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,"I wasn't ... like that. I don't ... act like that, dude."
89,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,All right? I'm not a little ... punk.
90,00:04:36.03,00:04:36.03,KEN: That's what you were acting like last night.
91,00:04:37.30,00:04:37.30,Today I don't know... even know
92,00:04:38.30,00:04:38.30,what the hell you're talking about.
93,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,"-I... -Hey, give me a straight answer."
94,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,"On the first vote, it was between me and Jed, right?"
95,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,KEN: You're damn straight it was.
96,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,-You're damn ... right it was. -Really?
97,00:04:47.60,00:04:47.60,-According to who? -According to everybody.
98,00:04:49.07,00:04:49.07,They couldn't st... You were annoying the ... out of
99,00:04:51.13,00:04:51.13,"everybody, because you wouldn't shut up,"
100,00:04:52.43,00:04:52.43,you kept on running your mouth.
101,00:04:53.70,00:04:53.70,I think I already told you this. But you know what?
102,00:04:55.37,00:04:55.37,"I'm probably lying, right?"
103,00:04:56.57,00:04:56.57,"You told me if you heard anything,"
104,00:04:57.80,00:04:57.80,"you were going to say it to me, and you didn't tell me."
105,00:05:00.63,00:05:00.63,That was a week and a half ago. I don't know what the hell
106,00:05:02.20,00:05:02.20,you're bringing that up now for.
107,00:05:03.57,00:05:03.57,"Bro, because trust is instilled early, and if it's..."
108,00:05:06.50,00:05:06.50,"... up early, then it's ... up forever."
109,00:05:08.37,00:05:08.37,I-I just think you got some set of balls
110,00:05:11.20,00:05:11.20,to approach me with this.
111,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,"I'm the only person that's been straight with you, and you just"
112,00:05:15.27,00:05:15.27,bit the ... hand that's been trying to feed you. I-I...
113,00:05:17.20,00:05:17.20,You obviously heard something about me before the first
114,00:05:18.73,00:05:18.73,Tribal Council that we had to go to. You didn't say a word to me
115,00:05:20.93,00:05:20.93,"-about it. -Okay, you should have addressed it back then."
116,00:05:22.37,00:05:22.37,-Don't wait a... -That was the whole basis of my argument.
117,00:05:24.10,00:05:24.10,"-Okay, well... -It's me thinking that you're not being truthful."
118,00:05:26.30,00:05:26.30,So don't ... try to tell me that I'm doing something I'm not.
119,00:05:28.10,00:05:28.10,"-Hey, well, then, why didn't you ask me? -All right?"
120,00:05:29.40,00:05:29.40,-'Cause I'm not ... stupid. -Why didn't you ask me?
121,00:05:31.47,00:05:31.47,Whatever.
122,00:05:35.60,00:05:35.60,Un ... believable.
123,00:05:40.87,00:05:40.87,"HELEN: Whoa! Drop off. All right, now..."
124,00:05:42.93,00:05:42.93,JAN: It's that big turn.
125,00:05:44.73,00:05:44.73,JAN: I do hate the fact  that the boat's gone.
126,00:05:47.67,00:05:47.67," It's really not a bad swim to the water source. It's just,"
127,00:05:50.73,00:05:50.73,it's still three miles.
128,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37," You know, it pulls  on your energy somewhat,"
129,00:05:54.33,00:05:54.33, whether you're aware  of it or not.
130,00:05:56.20,00:05:56.20,You guys all right?
131,00:05:58.20,00:05:58.20,JAN: We're on our way!
132,00:06:00.10,00:06:00.10,BRIAN: How far out are they?
133,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,They'll be here in about five minutes.
134,00:06:04.87,00:06:04.87,Or less.
135,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,HELEN:  The boat has been a
136,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,sore spot for everybody since we got here.
137,00:06:12.87,00:06:12.87," And then, the last time  we used it,"
138,00:06:15.27,00:06:15.27," um, the guys thought that they had it pretty secure,"
139,00:06:18.00,00:06:18.00, but the tide rose very high
140,00:06:21.63,00:06:21.63,and took our boat in the middle of the night.
141,00:06:24.07,00:06:24.07,"BRIAN: How was it, girls?"
142,00:06:25.63,00:06:25.63,JAN: It wasn't bad. She led the way
143,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,"going, I pushed the thing."
144,00:06:29.07,00:06:29.07,"HELEN: For the last several  days, it's been a mystery."
145,00:06:32.00,00:06:32.00," You know, where's the boat?"
146,00:06:33.50,00:06:33.50, Is the boat going to float  back? Is the boat sunk?
147,00:06:35.43,00:06:35.43,Is the boat on another shore?
148,00:06:37.10,00:06:37.10,"TED: Oh, boat, please just show up somewhere."
149,00:06:41.63,00:06:41.63,I think it's on the back side of that island.
150,00:06:43.03,00:06:43.03,Can't get over there.
151,00:06:44.27,00:06:44.27,I think it's around that island somewhere.
152,00:06:45.73,00:06:45.73,CLAY: The only other place  it could be
153,00:06:48.50,00:06:48.50," is over this island  across, you know,"
154,00:06:50.37,00:06:50.37," a mile over there, and, uh,"
155,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,so we decided to swim over and look around for the boat.
156,00:06:54.80,00:06:54.80,"BRIAN: We'll just head straight towards the island, you know?"
157,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17,"-TED: Yeah. -HELEN: You know, sometimes over water,"
158,00:06:59.93,00:06:59.93,land appears closer than it actually is.
159,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,JAN: That's a long way.
160,00:07:04.20,00:07:04.20,That is a long way.
161,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,"TED: The current is getting kind of strong, hmm?"
162,00:07:10.07,00:07:10.07,CLAY: I don't have enough air to float.
163,00:07:11.53,00:07:11.53,BRIAN: We got it. This is fun.
164,00:07:13.37,00:07:13.37,HELEN:  I think they got hopes that
165,00:07:15.23,00:07:15.23," maybe they'll find the boat  over there, but, you know,"
166,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17," Brian's a good swimmer,"
167,00:07:18.60,00:07:18.60,but even good swimmers get into trouble.
168,00:07:20.37,00:07:20.37,The other two are not even what I would classify as swimmers.
169,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83," Um, Clay did take  a float with him,"
170,00:07:25.63,00:07:25.63,and Ted was just out there on his own.
171,00:07:27.43,00:07:27.43,BRIAN: He didn't know where he was going.
172,00:07:30.00,00:07:30.00,-CLAY: Ted! -TED: Yo!
173,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,-CLAY: It's this way! -BRIAN: This way. -TED: Oh.
174,00:07:33.87,00:07:33.87,My bad.
175,00:07:35.77,00:07:35.77,I didn't realize I was swimming in the wrong direction.
176,00:07:38.03,00:07:38.03,Keep doing the breast stroke. Breast stroke for it here.
177,00:07:40.60,00:07:40.60,This is the most swimming I've ever done in my life.
178,00:07:43.63,00:07:43.63,"And each day,"
179,00:07:45.27,00:07:45.27,my skills are getting better and better and better and better.
180,00:07:48.60,00:07:48.60,I'm just at whale speed. Whale speed.
181,00:07:51.63,00:07:51.63,"CLAY:  The harder we'd swim,  it just"
182,00:07:54.03,00:07:54.03," seemed like, uh, we weren't  going anywhere."
183,00:07:55.63,00:07:55.63," The island was getting further  away, or staying right there."
184,00:07:57.93,00:07:57.93," We wasn't leaving this beach,"
185,00:07:59.30,00:07:59.30," and I got about halfway there,  and I thought, ""Man!"
186,00:08:01.23,00:08:01.23,"I'm not too sure I'm too proud I decided to come do this."""
187,00:08:05.97,00:08:05.97,-CLAY: Can you stand up? -TED: Yeah.
188,00:08:08.30,00:08:08.30,Got any rocks or anything?
189,00:08:10.23,00:08:10.23,There is a cove down this way.
190,00:08:12.03,00:08:12.03,"CLAY: We'll never see this ... again,"
191,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,"but if I ever do, I'm going to have a hamburger in my backpack."
192,00:08:16.77,00:08:16.77,-BRIAN: Uh-huh. -(Ted laughs)
193,00:08:17.97,00:08:17.97,"CLAY:  And then, you know,"
194,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67," you're there, you're only halfway through, 'cause you got"
195,00:08:21.93,00:08:21.93, to turn around and come back.
196,00:08:23.40,00:08:23.40," Oh, man, if I'd had  a little bitty pillow,"
197,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,I'd lay down on that island and stayed right there.
198,00:08:29.10,00:08:29.10,BRIAN: I just swam ahead  to try to find out if there's
199,00:08:31.83,00:08:31.83, another beach around  the actual point of the island
200,00:08:33.83,00:08:33.83, to see if I could  find a boat.
201,00:08:35.20,00:08:35.20,No boat in sight anywhere.
202,00:08:36.57,00:08:36.57,"Well, we covered everything that we could possibly cover."
203,00:08:40.03,00:08:40.03,I think the boat is halfway to Malaysia.
204,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60,"BRIAN: I think so, too."
205,00:08:47.57,00:08:47.57,"CLAY: It's not here. Far as  I know, it's not in this whole"
206,00:08:50.37,00:08:50.37,side of the world. It's-It's gone.
207,00:08:55.47,00:08:55.47, I don't think anybody wants
208,00:08:57.10,00:08:57.10,to talk about that boat no more.
209,00:09:06.20,00:09:06.20,(chickens clucking)
210,00:09:19.80,00:09:19.80,"ROBB: I'm starving, bro."
211,00:09:21.53,00:09:21.53,KEN: So?
212,00:09:27.90,00:09:27.90,Right there is a good one.
213,00:09:29.67,00:09:29.67,"Dude, just relax."
214,00:09:32.27,00:09:32.27,I'm over it.
215,00:09:33.37,00:09:33.37,KEN: Unbelievable.
216,00:09:34.60,00:09:34.60,(laughs)
217,00:09:36.93,00:09:36.93,"KEN: We had all agreed  to not touch the bananas,"
218,00:09:40.30,00:09:40.30," wait till they get ripe,"
219,00:09:41.53,00:09:41.53, because Robb's   capable of eating
220,00:09:42.73,00:09:42.73,"30 bananas a day, Penny's not,"
221,00:09:44.37,00:09:44.37,so we're going to do it in a fair manner.
222,00:09:46.30,00:09:46.30,KEN: What's the deal? Are we eating the bananas?
223,00:09:47.80,00:09:47.80,Are we not eating the bananas? How's this work?
224,00:09:49.57,00:09:49.57,PENNY: I don't know.
225,00:09:50.67,00:09:50.67,We're waiting on the bananas.
226,00:09:51.90,00:09:51.90,"KEN: Well, Robb's in there, he's in there digging for bananas."
227,00:09:53.93,00:09:53.93,(mutters): I don't know
228,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,"ROBB: I was hungry,  so I had a banana."
229,00:09:57.63,00:09:57.63, I don't think anyone wants  to have to ask somebody
230,00:10:00.17,00:10:00.17, if they can have a banana.
231,00:10:01.53,00:10:01.53," We want them,  we're going to enjoy them."
232,00:10:03.30,00:10:03.30,"We worked really hard for that food,"
233,00:10:05.07,00:10:05.07, but Ken just took it  upon himself
234,00:10:06.73,00:10:06.73, to be the policeman out here.
235,00:10:08.90,00:10:08.90,"So what is this, a free-for-all on the bananas?"
236,00:10:11.20,00:10:11.20,"-Is that how we're doing it? -ROBB: Yeah, I'm talking about,"
237,00:10:13.10,00:10:13.10,"when we're hungry, eat a banana."
238,00:10:14.67,00:10:14.67,"People are going to be hungry, they're going to eat a banana."
239,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50,It's not like I'm gonna walk around
240,00:10:17.73,00:10:17.73,with four bananas in my hand
241,00:10:18.90,00:10:18.90,and sit down and eat all four of them.
242,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,"Are we just eating the bananas whenever, then?"
243,00:10:22.37,00:10:22.37,All I know is that we worked hard for those bananas.
244,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,"If we're going to eat them, we're going to eat them."
245,00:10:25.43,00:10:25.43,"SHII ANN: Dude, I'm not complaining about that, but you"
246,00:10:26.90,00:10:26.90,"-just grabbed another banana. -Okay, I don't want to argue"
247,00:10:28.30,00:10:28.30,"over a banana. I'm hungry, I'm gonna eat a banana."
248,00:10:29.87,00:10:29.87,I don't even want to hear the word.
249,00:10:31.17,00:10:31.17,"I'm not trying to squabble about the bananas,"
250,00:10:33.33,00:10:33.33,"-but, like, we're just trying... -All right, well, then shut up."
251,00:10:34.83,00:10:34.83,...I'm just trying to figure out what the system is.
252,00:10:36.10,00:10:36.10,SHII ANN: That's such bull ...
253,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,"He's eaten, like, more bananas than everybody else here."
254,00:10:41.13,00:10:41.13,"PENNY: Shii Ann started  to get in the middle of it,"
255,00:10:43.43,00:10:43.43," and I said,  ""Shii Ann, stay out of it."
256,00:10:45.97,00:10:45.97," ""We don't need you involved."
257,00:10:47.53,00:10:47.53,"We need to stay focused, let the two of them figure it out."""
258,00:10:50.43,00:10:50.43," But why they continue to act  like children, I'm not"
259,00:10:55.07,00:10:55.07," really sure, but I think  we all need to leave them"
260,00:10:57.27,00:10:57.27,"alone, really, and let the two of them work it out."
261,00:11:18.90,00:11:18.90,"PROBST: Come on in, guys."
262,00:11:20.23,00:11:20.23,"All right, for today's reward challenge, we've combined"
263,00:11:24.20,00:11:24.20,"elements of a very popular Thai game,"
264,00:11:26.40,00:11:26.40,"using wicker balls and baskets, to create our own unique"
265,00:11:29.97,00:11:29.97, Survivor reward challenge. Here's how it works.
266,00:11:32.47,00:11:32.47,Each tribe will select one member
267,00:11:34.17,00:11:34.17,to be their ball launcher. The other four members
268,00:11:36.93,00:11:36.93,"will be out at four stations in the beach,"
269,00:11:40.13,00:11:40.13,and you'll each be paired up with somebody
270,00:11:41.77,00:11:41.77,from the other tribe. Your job--
271,00:11:43.70,00:11:43.70,"using wicker baskets, catch the balls being launched"
272,00:11:46.07,00:11:46.07,by your ball launcher.
273,00:11:47.87,00:11:47.87,"Every time you catch one, you score a point."
274,00:11:49.67,00:11:49.67,"At the same time, you're trying to stop"
275,00:11:52.23,00:11:52.23,the other tribe from catching their ball.
276,00:11:54.83,00:11:54.83,Each tribe may call one timeout.
277,00:11:56.77,00:11:56.77,"During a timeout, you can strategize."
278,00:11:59.17,00:11:59.17,You can also swap positions.
279,00:12:01.03,00:12:01.03,First tribe to catch five wicker balls wins reward.
280,00:12:03.57,00:12:03.57,Want to know what you're playing for?
281,00:12:05.23,00:12:05.23,"-Yeah. -PROBST: Number one,"
282,00:12:06.47,00:12:06.47,get you away from your beach for a while.
283,00:12:08.40,00:12:08.40,"Number two, you get a chance to experience Thai culture,"
284,00:12:12.23,00:12:12.23,"and number three, you get to indulge in a massive feast."
285,00:12:15.13,00:12:15.13,(people gasping and sighing)
286,00:12:16.70,00:12:16.70,Here's just a sample of the many delicacies you'll be eating.
287,00:12:20.53,00:12:20.53,"A little fresh pineapple stuffed with rice and cashews,"
288,00:12:22.97,00:12:22.97,"prawns the size of your fist,"
289,00:12:24.47,00:12:24.47,and a little bit of wine to toast your victory.
290,00:12:27.13,00:12:27.13,"You're going to come back very full,"
291,00:12:29.30,00:12:29.30,"and hopefully, in a good frame of mind."
292,00:12:31.10,00:12:31.10,"Okay, Sook Jai, because you have one extra member,"
293,00:12:33.20,00:12:33.20,you're sitting  one person out.
294,00:12:34.37,00:12:34.37,"Shii Ann, it's going to be you. The rest"
295,00:12:35.90,00:12:35.90,"of the tribes, figure out your strategy, wait for my go."
296,00:12:38.03,00:12:38.03,"-Turn around, 'cause they're coming back at you. -Right."
297,00:12:40.73,00:12:40.73,-Sook Jai! -Chuay Gahn!

301,00:12:58.73,00:12:58.73,(grunting)

396,00:16:57.80,00:16:57.80,"-we're going to eat tonight. -Oh, awesome."
397,00:16:59.10,00:16:59.10,"Sook Jai, clearly a good team effort. I got to say, Robb, you"
398,00:17:02.27,00:17:02.27,"-carried this one all the way. -SHII ANN: Yeah, you did."
399,00:17:04.10,00:17:04.10,"PROBST: Four out of five balls, not bad."
400,00:17:05.90,00:17:05.90,"A feast awaits. Guys, this way."
401,00:17:07.83,00:17:07.83,(women whooping)
402,00:17:09.80,00:17:09.80,ERIN:  Sook Jai!
403,00:17:32.70,00:17:32.70,(Clay mutters)
404,00:17:36.13,00:17:36.13,Zero. We do zero.
405,00:17:38.30,00:17:38.30,TED: Oh!
406,00:17:40.30,00:17:40.30,"Bro, you don't know how much I ... hate losing,"
407,00:17:43.63,00:17:43.63,especially when you're giving 100 and million percent.
408,00:17:46.47,00:17:46.47,-You know what I mean? -BRIAN: I hear you.
409,00:17:48.47,00:17:48.47,TED:  Although this isn't blamed
410,00:17:50.43,00:17:50.43, on a single person  or a single event--
411,00:17:53.30,00:17:53.30,"we all gave our best-- it's just in this case,"
412,00:17:55.97,00:17:55.97,our best wasn't good enough.
413,00:17:57.80,00:17:57.80,Hmm.
414,00:17:59.00,00:17:59.00,TED: What could we have done different?
415,00:18:00.47,00:18:00.47,CLAY: Not what... Swimming so damn far.
416,00:18:02.80,00:18:02.80,"I mean, we got tired."
417,00:18:04.57,00:18:04.57,I was... I was tired.
418,00:18:05.90,00:18:05.90,"-CLAY: I was, too. -I was tired."
419,00:18:07.90,00:18:07.90,"(Clay mumbling, Ted sighing)"
420,00:18:09.60,00:18:09.60,"HELEN:  It was hot out on the beach,"
421,00:18:11.63,00:18:11.63," there was a lot  of, uh, running around."
422,00:18:13.30,00:18:13.30, I think our guys were tired
423,00:18:14.77,00:18:14.77,'cause they swam all the way over
424,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,"to the other island, looking for the boat."
425,00:18:18.37,00:18:18.37," You know, there were some  tempers flying, and"
426,00:18:20.63,00:18:20.63," I lost mine a little bit,  too, and,"
427,00:18:22.90,00:18:22.90,"you know, the heat of the game."
428,00:18:24.50,00:18:24.50,"You guys may understand, but in the heat of battle,"
429,00:18:27.27,00:18:27.27,I'm not pointing you out as an individual.
430,00:18:30.27,00:18:30.27,"I'm just saying, ""Hey, this is what we need to do to win."""
431,00:18:34.17,00:18:34.17,-Right. -So please don't take it personally.
432,00:18:36.10,00:18:36.10,"Yeah, it was a heartfelt loss,  especially"
433,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17, considering  what the reward was.
434,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50, I'm assuming they're going
435,00:18:42.53,00:18:42.53, to somewhere where  there's going to be a Thai
436,00:18:44.90,00:18:44.90,festival type of atmosphere. I don't know.
437,00:18:47.37,00:18:47.37," Whatever it is,  it's better than"
438,00:18:50.50,00:18:50.50, coming back and pulling clams  off of rocks.
439,00:19:11.90,00:19:11.90,"-Oh, my God! -Wow."
440,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,"-How amazing is this? -PENNY: Oh, wow."
441,00:19:16.07,00:19:16.07,"Y'all, this tea is so good, I could drink it like milk."
442,00:19:18.73,00:19:18.73,"Oh, I'd love some."
443,00:19:19.83,00:19:19.83,ROBB: You couldn't imagine  a more perfect setting
444,00:19:21.93,00:19:21.93, and a more perfect feast  laid out in front of us.
445,00:19:23.90,00:19:23.90,"Wow, ice water. It's so good."
446,00:19:26.53,00:19:26.53,ROBB:  There's all the little things
447,00:19:27.97,00:19:27.97," you never knew meant so much,"
448,00:19:29.63,00:19:29.63, Cold water with ice cubes
449,00:19:31.07,00:19:31.07,and clean plates and forks and napkins to wipe
450,00:19:33.90,00:19:33.90, -our faces.  -What is this?
451,00:19:35.40,00:19:35.40,"SHII ANN: That's, um,"
452,00:19:36.77,00:19:36.77,shredded pork or shrimp.
453,00:19:38.37,00:19:38.37,"Wow, look at this, would you?"
454,00:19:39.80,00:19:39.80,"-Wow. -Mmm. -Oh, yeah."
455,00:19:41.57,00:19:41.57,ERIN: We are eating with gold utensils. How crazy is that?
456,00:19:43.67,00:19:43.67, I didn't expect something
457,00:19:45.57,00:19:45.57,"that ornate, that extravagant."
458,00:19:48.20,00:19:48.20," I mean, I felt like royalty  sitting there."
459,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,"-(belching) -JAKE: Oh. -PENNY: Oh, wow. "
460,00:19:52.67,00:19:52.67,-They're about to play some music. -SHII ANN: They're gonna
461,00:19:54.07,00:19:54.07,-play something for us. -Look.
462,00:19:56.30,00:19:56.30,"-Oh, my God. -This is so good, y'all."
463,00:19:57.83,00:19:57.83,(grunting)
464,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,"You guys, today we worked so hard."
465,00:20:04.77,00:20:04.77,"After all the drama this morning, this is honestly better"
466,00:20:07.30,00:20:07.30,than anything I could have ever imagined.
467,00:20:08.73,00:20:08.73,"PENNY: We love you, Robb."
468,00:20:10.13,00:20:10.13, Robb was definitely  a key factor
469,00:20:12.60,00:20:12.60,"in our reward challenge and us having that fabulous Thai food,"
470,00:20:15.97,00:20:15.97, and if there was
471,00:20:17.43,00:20:17.43,"an MVP award we could give, he would have won it, for sure."
472,00:20:20.83,00:20:20.83,"Y'all, we were fighting over unripe bananas."
473,00:20:24.10,00:20:24.10,ERIN: (laughing): This morning.
474,00:20:25.27,00:20:25.27,"SHII ANN: I know, that was ridiculous."
475,00:20:26.53,00:20:26.53,"PENNY: Y'all, how silly does this morning seem now?"
476,00:20:28.27,00:20:28.27,SHII ANN: The morning was retarded.
477,00:20:29.87,00:20:29.87,"-Oh, my God, look. -Look at this. -God!"
478,00:20:31.87,00:20:31.87,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
479,00:20:43.23,00:20:43.23,SHII ANN:  It was just
480,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87," so wonderful to be able  to see some Thai culture,"
481,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47," to see the dancing,  to hear the music."
482,00:20:56.03,00:20:56.03," I mean, I felt like  just for a second that we were"
483,00:20:58.73,00:20:58.73," just maybe even friends,  just there enjoying each other"
484,00:21:01.67,00:21:01.67," and enjoying the meal  and put aside the game,"
485,00:21:04.13,00:21:04.13," and that very rarely happens  for Sook Jai,"
486,00:21:07.47,00:21:07.47,so it was really nice.
487,00:21:22.83,00:21:22.83,(squeaking)
488,00:21:26.57,00:21:26.57,CLAY: Look at that sunrise.
489,00:21:28.40,00:21:28.40,"-Wow, look at those clouds. -BRIAN: Mm-hmm."
490,00:21:30.27,00:21:30.27,"CLAY: Man, isn't that pretty?"
491,00:21:31.90,00:21:31.90,TED: I was telling Brian I have a feeling a merger is coming on.
492,00:21:35.23,00:21:35.23,"-So... -Oh, I do, too. No doubt."
493,00:21:36.80,00:21:36.80,TED: I have been horrible  in predicting so far.
494,00:21:39.23,00:21:39.23," However,"
495,00:21:40.23,00:21:40.23,I suspect that a merger is going to happen
496,00:21:43.13,00:21:43.13,"very, very, very soon."
497,00:21:44.77,00:21:44.77,I kind of have a feeling
498,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,that it's going to happen in the next three days.
499,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,"It could, I wouldn't be surprised,"
500,00:21:49.50,00:21:49.50,but I guarantee you it will happen
501,00:21:51.07,00:21:51.07,before two more immunities.
502,00:21:52.77,00:21:52.77,TED:  We need the immunity badly.
503,00:21:54.90,00:21:54.90, Right now Sook Jai is up six  members; we have five members.
504,00:21:58.77,00:21:58.77," If we can win immunity  one more time,"
505,00:22:00.87,00:22:00.87, then they have  to come down to five
506,00:22:02.90,00:22:02.90,and then it's just going to almost be
507,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,like starting all over again.
508,00:22:05.63,00:22:05.63,(sighs)
509,00:22:08.73,00:22:08.73,We still in play?
510,00:22:09.73,00:22:09.73,"Yeah, of course."
511,00:22:10.73,00:22:10.73,"Okay, cool."
512,00:22:12.13,00:22:12.13,(both laugh)
513,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70,BRIAN: Ted and I have still  a very strong relationship.
514,00:22:18.07,00:22:18.07,"We have a certain lingo that, when we talk about,"
515,00:22:19.60,00:22:19.60,we both know exactly where our head's at.
516,00:22:21.37,00:22:21.37,"Yeah, when the merge comes, man, it's gonna be important"
517,00:22:23.83,00:22:23.83,-for all of us to kind of stay together. -Yeah.
518,00:22:26.30,00:22:26.30,-I know exactly where your head's at. -Cool.
519,00:22:28.20,00:22:28.20,BRIAN: All we really want  to do is just kind of be
520,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07, very low-keyed.
521,00:22:32.43,00:22:32.43," No one needs to know  of our strong friendship,"
522,00:22:33.93,00:22:33.93,and we're kind of just seeing if anybody's playing us.
523,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,I think Clay is trying to figure us out.
524,00:22:40.37,00:22:40.37,I think so.
525,00:22:41.87,00:22:41.87,We'll just see what happens when that situation comes into play.
526,00:22:44.87,00:22:44.87,"-I'm gonna play it down, man, I'm gonna play... -Of course."
527,00:22:46.87,00:22:46.87,"-""I don't know what you're talking about."" -Yeah."
528,00:22:48.40,00:22:48.40,Watch your back.
529,00:22:51.00,00:22:51.00,TED: Clay doesn't know  about the verbal alliance
530,00:22:53.60,00:22:53.60," between Brian and myself,"
531,00:22:55.57,00:22:55.57,which we established from day one.
532,00:22:57.30,00:22:57.30," If Clay does find out,  or if anyone does find out"
533,00:23:00.77,00:23:00.77," that we do have an alliance,"
534,00:23:02.87,00:23:02.87, it could bite us  and it could ruin
535,00:23:04.10,00:23:04.10,our game plan for the rest of the game.
536,00:23:23.20,00:23:23.20,KEN: How big were those prawns yesterday?
537,00:23:26.03,00:23:26.03,"ROBB: Oh, my God, dude, I..."
538,00:23:27.40,00:23:27.40,I can't wait to eat some more Thai food like that.
539,00:23:29.77,00:23:29.77,It's never going to be that pretty
540,00:23:30.83,00:23:30.83,"or in that same place, though."
541,00:23:33.47,00:23:33.47,"ROBB: That amazing meal yesterday, eating on the beach,"
542,00:23:36.33,00:23:36.33, and watching the Thai dancers  and the guys play the music--
543,00:23:38.60,00:23:38.60,it was amazing.
544,00:23:40.33,00:23:40.33, I think it opened my mind  a little bit.
545,00:23:43.13,00:23:43.13,This whole experience already--  it's not
546,00:23:45.00,00:23:45.00," that I've been taking  it for granted,"
547,00:23:46.37,00:23:46.37,but I think I can appreciate it  a little bit more.
548,00:23:48.30,00:23:48.30,Look at this-- snakeskin.
549,00:23:50.87,00:23:50.87,"Whatever it shed it's small, though-- look at it--"
550,00:23:53.10,00:23:53.10,unless this is the very tip of its tail.
551,00:23:57.97,00:23:57.97, Today Ken and I took a walk into the jungle and walked back
552,00:24:01.13,00:24:01.13,further than I've been since I've been here.
553,00:24:05.27,00:24:05.27,KEN: This is nice.
554,00:24:09.53,00:24:09.53,"ROBB: Cool, dude."
555,00:24:10.77,00:24:10.77,KEN: I didn't realize it went back like that.
556,00:24:12.60,00:24:12.60,ROBB: Look at this.
557,00:24:13.87,00:24:13.87,"-(bat squeaks) -KEN: If you freak them out,"
558,00:24:15.77,00:24:15.77,they're all going to fly out.
559,00:24:16.87,00:24:16.87,"Dude, it's huge."
560,00:24:17.87,00:24:17.87,(bat squeaks)
561,00:24:19.23,00:24:19.23,"ROBB:   When we walked in the cave,"
562,00:24:21.20,00:24:21.20," there's bats flying  all over the place inside,"
563,00:24:23.13,00:24:23.13,and I-I walked back kind of far
564,00:24:24.33,00:24:24.33,in there and looked back.
565,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,There are so many back in here.
566,00:24:26.63,00:24:26.63,KEN: I know there are.
567,00:24:27.63,00:24:27.63,"Holy ..., dude, look at this."
568,00:24:29.63,00:24:29.63,"Robb, be careful."
569,00:24:30.97,00:24:30.97,"-(whispers): Come on, man. -Don't start screaming."
570,00:24:32.37,00:24:32.37,"ROBB: It's just amazing,  to be able to walk"
571,00:24:34.23,00:24:34.23,and find such a beautiful place
572,00:24:35.33,00:24:35.33,that we've been taking for granted.
573,00:24:36.90,00:24:36.90,I never would have thought that I'd be sitting here in a cave
574,00:24:39.73,00:24:39.73,"in the middle of a jungle in Thailand,"
575,00:24:41.40,00:24:41.40,savoring one banana and a canteen full of water
576,00:24:44.73,00:24:44.73,that's warm as piss and tastes even worse.
577,00:24:46.77,00:24:46.77," I did so much thinking about,"
578,00:24:48.70,00:24:48.70," I'll never be here  again in my life,"
579,00:24:51.23,00:24:51.23,and it just puts everything in perspective that much more.
580,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67,"Ken and I really squashed the beef and really had, I mean,"
581,00:24:56.83,00:24:56.83, an amazing enough conversation
582,00:24:58.20,00:24:58.20," that he made me  make sense to myself,"
583,00:25:00.47,00:25:00.47,and not many people have done that.
584,00:25:01.93,00:25:01.93,"Listen, it's like you're always"
585,00:25:04.37,00:25:04.37,"-trying to tell me what to do. -Well, you know what?"
586,00:25:06.27,00:25:06.27,"Maybe you should listen when somebody is trying to help you,"
587,00:25:08.40,00:25:08.40,because that's all I've been trying to do
588,00:25:10.07,00:25:10.07,since you've been here.
589,00:25:11.27,00:25:11.27,And you know what?
590,00:25:12.27,00:25:12.27,It's getting harder and harder to help you.
591,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17, Robb and I really don't have  too many differences.
592,00:25:16.73,00:25:16.73," It's just that he's  a young kid, he just needs..."
593,00:25:19.03,00:25:19.03,"That's why I took him out there today-- to talk to him,"
594,00:25:20.87,00:25:20.87,"that's it, you know, just get his head straight"
595,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,because I know he's not doing too well out here.
596,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73,"ROBB: Hey, for real, though,"
597,00:25:25.70,00:25:25.70,"I really appreciate you talking to me, Ken."
598,00:25:28.00,00:25:28.00,"Now that we go back, you're feeling a lot better,"
599,00:25:29.83,00:25:29.83,and then everybody gets along well.
600,00:25:31.77,00:25:31.77,-ROBB: Amen.  -We definitely made peace.
601,00:25:33.70,00:25:33.70, It was good.
602,00:25:35.40,00:25:35.40,I guess it was like hanging out with an older brother.
603,00:25:44.80,00:25:44.80," JAN: Helen, we have  to have a funeral."
604,00:25:46.90,00:25:46.90,HELEN: Why?
605,00:25:47.90,00:25:47.90,I found a baby bat.
606,00:25:50.23,00:25:50.23,-Aw... -And it's dead.
607,00:25:52.00,00:25:52.00,"I have it hidden so y'all can see it,"
608,00:25:55.03,00:25:55.03,and we're going to bury it with a cross.
609,00:25:57.37,00:25:57.37,HELEN: Jan was all upset  'cause she found
610,00:25:59.00,00:25:59.00," this, uh-- really, I would"
611,00:26:01.67,00:26:01.67,not even call it a baby bat yet; it was still embryonic stage--
612,00:26:05.07,00:26:05.07,"um, slimy, little baby bat thing."
613,00:26:07.23,00:26:07.23,"Oh, God."
614,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,See?
615,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23,"-That's its head there. -Tiny, tiny."
616,00:26:11.63,00:26:11.63,"-Yes, there's its little bat arms. -Man."
617,00:26:15.23,00:26:15.23,"HELEN:   I feel bad if a kitten dies,"
618,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40," but I'm looking  at this slimy bat, going,"
619,00:26:19.23,00:26:19.23,"""Uh, yeah, okay, that's real sad,"" you know?"
620,00:26:21.73,00:26:21.73,"""Bury that thing before flies get all over it."""
621,00:26:24.03,00:26:24.03,"TED: You guys are gonna have the funeral, right?"
622,00:26:25.90,00:26:25.90,"-JAN: Yes. -TED: Okay. -HELEN: You're invited, Ted."
623,00:26:27.97,00:26:27.97,I'll send a card and some flowers.
624,00:26:31.80,00:26:31.80,"BRIAN:  She wanted to have a funeral,"
625,00:26:33.63,00:26:33.63," and named it Oscar,  and was quite sad"
626,00:26:36.40,00:26:36.40, about the little bat  that I was curious
627,00:26:38.73,00:26:38.73,if we could eat it or not--
628,00:26:39.80,00:26:39.80,that was my first words out of my mouth.
629,00:26:41.27,00:26:41.27,"JAN: Oh, poor baby."
630,00:26:43.17,00:26:43.17,"Didn't have a chance, did you, baby?"
631,00:26:45.53,00:26:45.53,"BRIAN:  But again, I don't know"
632,00:26:47.63,00:26:47.63," if that's just  Jan being emotional or if, uh,"
633,00:26:50.50,00:26:50.50,she's actually losing it a little bit out here.
634,00:26:53.63,00:26:53.63,"JAN:  I know it's silly, but"
635,00:26:55.70,00:26:55.70,"I feel sorry for him, so I buried him and he's happy."
636,00:26:59.20,00:26:59.20,(laughs) And I'll quit crying in a minute.
637,00:27:02.07,00:27:02.07,"But I'm very sensitive, so-- especially about little animals"
638,00:27:04.80,00:27:04.80,that are-- don't have a chance.
639,00:27:07.57,00:27:07.57,Here you go.
640,00:27:13.53,00:27:13.53,-Treemail. -It's ensconced in the mailbox.
641,00:27:15.57,00:27:15.57,Got treemail.
642,00:27:17.60,00:27:17.60,"TED: We got something, huh?"
643,00:27:18.90,00:27:18.90,HELEN: Uh-oh.
644,00:27:20.00,00:27:20.00,-A map? -We don't know that language.
645,00:27:21.53,00:27:21.53,"-TED: What the...? -BRIAN: ""21, a game of luck?"""
646,00:27:23.13,00:27:23.13,"HELEN: ""Not here in this place"
647,00:27:24.63,00:27:24.63,"""If your mind's not sharp enough,"
648,00:27:26.80,00:27:26.80,"you could be gone without a trace."""
649,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,"TED: So it's, it's for immunity."
650,00:27:29.60,00:27:29.60," I mean, today we received  an interesting treemail."
651,00:27:32.47,00:27:32.47, And I think this one is going  to be
652,00:27:34.30,00:27:34.30,"more of a mental challenge, no matter what it is."
653,00:27:36.63,00:27:36.63,"21, so it could be 21 blackjack."
654,00:27:39.53,00:27:39.53,"CLAY: Oh, yeah."
655,00:27:40.53,00:27:40.53,"The merge has to be happening in the next three to four days,"
656,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50, so it's extremely important
657,00:27:44.97,00:27:44.97," that this tribe wins,  'cause if it doesn't,"
658,00:27:47.43,00:27:47.43,they can sit there and pick us off one by one
659,00:27:49.47,00:27:49.47,and get down to just their tribe.
660,00:27:58.50,00:27:58.50,"PROBST: Welcome, guys. First things first--"
661,00:28:00.50,00:28:00.50,"as always, give it up, Jan."
662,00:28:02.47,00:28:02.47,"Oh, I hate to."
663,00:28:03.47,00:28:03.47,-(laughs) -PROBST: Immunity--
664,00:28:05.50,00:28:05.50,the most coveted prize in this game-- back up for grabs.
665,00:28:08.97,00:28:08.97,"To win it, you simply have to outsmart the other tribe."
666,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,Today's challenge is all mental.
667,00:28:13.53,00:28:13.53,It's called Thai 21.
668,00:28:15.40,00:28:15.40,Here's how it works.
669,00:28:16.67,00:28:16.67,There are 21 flags in this circle.
670,00:28:19.00,00:28:19.00,Your goal-- be the tribe to get the last flag.
671,00:28:23.33,00:28:23.33,"Here's the twist-- on each move,"
672,00:28:25.27,00:28:25.27,"you can only grab one, two, or three flags,"
673,00:28:29.27,00:28:29.27,so clearly the strategy lies in determining
674,00:28:32.40,00:28:32.40,how many flags to grab and when to grab them.
675,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,"Sook Jai, because you have one extra member,"
676,00:28:37.93,00:28:37.93,you're sitting somebody out.
677,00:28:38.93,00:28:38.93,"-Robb, plant it on the big rock. -(Robb mutters)"
678,00:28:41.73,00:28:41.73,"Guys, take a seat on your benches, start strategizing."
679,00:28:44.27,00:28:44.27,-Wait for my go. -ERIN: And we can take two.
680,00:28:46.37,00:28:46.37,"-We can take two and we win. -We, we want"
681,00:28:47.70,00:28:47.70,-the last flag. -You understand?
682,00:28:49.07,00:28:49.07,"At the end, we want to make sure there's four flags."
683,00:28:51.27,00:28:51.27,"-CLAY: Five or four? -Five. -No, four."
684,00:28:52.67,00:28:52.67,"PROBST: Here we go, guys."
685,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,"Sook Jai, you won the coin toss, you elected to go first."
686,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,Make your first move.
687,00:28:58.83,00:28:58.83,"You must grab one, two, or three flags."
688,00:29:01.53,00:29:01.53,Sook Jai electing to grab two.
689,00:29:10.83,00:29:10.83,"Sook Jai takes two flags on their first move, leaving 19."
690,00:29:14.47,00:29:14.47,"Chuay Gahn, make your move."
691,00:29:19.00,00:29:19.00,Chuay Gahn also takes two.
692,00:29:22.67,00:29:22.67,Very simple game with huge consequences.
693,00:29:26.93,00:29:26.93,"After one round, we're down to 17 flags."
694,00:29:29.10,00:29:29.10,"Sook Jai, make your move."
695,00:29:33.47,00:29:33.47,"Sook Jai takes two more flags, leaving 15."
696,00:29:36.00,00:29:36.00,"Chuay Gahn, make your move."
697,00:29:37.17,00:29:37.17,I hope that's right.
698,00:29:39.00,00:29:39.00,PROBST: Chuay Gahn takes one.
699,00:29:41.67,00:29:41.67,We're down to 14 flags.
700,00:29:43.67,00:29:43.67,"Sook Jai, your move."
701,00:29:45.43,00:29:45.43,Penny takes one.
702,00:29:49.83,00:29:49.83,Chuay Gahn also takes one.
703,00:29:52.10,00:29:52.10,We are down to 12 flags.
704,00:29:54.00,00:29:54.00,"I have a better feeling about, though, staying"
705,00:29:55.23,00:29:55.23,-on odds. -She wants to take one.
706,00:29:56.60,00:29:56.60,"-TED: We have two more... -CLAY: I know, but you take"
707,00:29:58.13,00:29:58.13,"the three away, that's nine."
708,00:30:00.27,00:30:00.27,"Sook Jai, it is your move."
709,00:30:01.47,00:30:01.47,Make it.
710,00:30:08.27,00:30:08.27,We're now down to 11 flags.
711,00:30:10.73,00:30:10.73,"Chuay Gahn, your move."
712,00:30:18.60,00:30:18.60,We are now down to nine flags.
713,00:30:21.07,00:30:21.07,Immunity at stake.
714,00:30:22.73,00:30:22.73,Your moves are becoming very critical.
715,00:30:25.60,00:30:25.60,"You guys have to help me think, you've got to help me think."
716,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,"Sook Jai, it is your move."
717,00:30:29.07,00:30:29.07,Make it.
718,00:30:30.07,00:30:30.07,How many?
719,00:30:31.23,00:30:31.23,"I don't know, you guys, this is... I don't know."
720,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,So I think we're looking good.
721,00:30:35.03,00:30:35.03,We just got to see what they take and take the same amount.
722,00:30:36.77,00:30:36.77,"Take three, there's six."
723,00:30:38.23,00:30:38.23,And they could take one.
724,00:30:40.03,00:30:40.03,"Got to make a move, guys."
725,00:30:41.40,00:30:41.40,"One, two, or three flags."
726,00:30:43.80,00:30:43.80,Let's go.
727,00:30:45.93,00:30:45.93,"HELEN: They're going, they're going three,"
728,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,they're going three.
729,00:30:48.33,00:30:48.33,PROBST: Sook Jai takes three.
730,00:30:57.63,00:30:57.63,There are six flags remaining.
731,00:30:59.73,00:30:59.73,"Chuay Gahn, it's your move."
732,00:31:01.73,00:31:01.73,What y'all want to do?
733,00:31:03.07,00:31:03.07,"-If they take two, we would-- we'd lose. -We lose?"
734,00:31:05.23,00:31:05.23,"Yeah, if they take two, we lose."
735,00:31:07.07,00:31:07.07,"-Take one. -Hey, listen, we just take one."
736,00:31:09.53,00:31:09.53,That's an awful long time to think about it.
737,00:31:10.77,00:31:10.77,We have to go pick up two flags.
738,00:31:12.40,00:31:12.40,-We have to pick up two. -We have to pick up two.
739,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,-Yes. -Shh. Shh!
740,00:31:15.17,00:31:15.17,Let's go.
741,00:31:16.53,00:31:16.53,"Want to do it? Let's go, buddy."
742,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30,"-They're taking two? -We lost. -We lost, we lost it."
743,00:31:22.77,00:31:22.77,SHII ANN: We lost.
744,00:31:26.47,00:31:26.47,JAKE: They won it.
745,00:31:29.60,00:31:29.60,That sucks.
746,00:31:31.07,00:31:31.07,That move will clinch it.
747,00:31:33.60,00:31:33.60,"Sook Jai, make your last move."
748,00:31:36.30,00:31:36.30,Play this game out.
749,00:31:37.63,00:31:37.63,Making a very classy move in grabbing three flags.
750,00:31:41.00,00:31:41.00,Good job.
751,00:31:42.47,00:31:42.47,Thanks.
752,00:31:47.03,00:31:47.03,"Chuay Gahn, nicely played."
753,00:31:48.23,00:31:48.23,Grab your last flag.
754,00:31:55.80,00:31:55.80,"Everyone, put your hand on it."
755,00:31:57.37,00:31:57.37,"Let's go, let's take it back together."
756,00:32:01.37,00:32:01.37,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
757,00:32:08.63,00:32:08.63,"Way to go, way to go, way to go."

763,00:32:17.03,00:32:17.03,"just another reminder of how one wrong move,"
764,00:32:20.93,00:32:20.93,and you're out of the game.
765,00:32:21.93,00:32:21.93,One of you will be.
766,00:32:23.57,00:32:23.57,I'll see you tomorrow night at Tribal Council.
767,00:32:25.97,00:32:25.97,You can head back to camp.
768,00:32:52.73,00:32:52.73,JAKE: We lost the immunity challenge.
769,00:32:54.73,00:32:54.73, Everybody is really
770,00:32:56.03,00:32:56.03,"bummed out about that, 'cause we really wanted to win it."
771,00:32:58.67,00:32:58.67,(murmuring indistinctly)
772,00:33:00.87,00:33:00.87,"This is the first, first time I've been upset"
773,00:33:03.23,00:33:03.23,about any challenge we've lost.
774,00:33:04.73,00:33:04.73,This was important.
775,00:33:05.93,00:33:05.93,"Yeah, it was."
776,00:33:08.43,00:33:08.43,JAKE: Do we dig out the wine and talk about it?
777,00:33:10.43,00:33:10.43,ERIN:  We decided to open up
778,00:33:12.50,00:33:12.50, our wine that we had  from our food reward...
779,00:33:15.73,00:33:15.73,We got a lot of wine left.
780,00:33:17.17,00:33:17.17, ...and just kind of came  to grips with the fact
781,00:33:19.13,00:33:19.13,that we were going to have to get rid of someone.
782,00:33:20.80,00:33:20.80,(blows)
783,00:33:22.17,00:33:22.17,"ROBB: This is our last night together as a family, guys,"
784,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,the six of us.

786,00:33:27.83,00:33:27.83,"good, that's for sure."
787,00:33:29.00,00:33:29.00,"This is a game of up and downs, isn't it?"
788,00:33:31.00,00:33:31.00,"I mean, up one minute, totally down the next."
789,00:33:34.63,00:33:34.63,"ROBB: You know what, man? It's all positive."
790,00:33:36.80,00:33:36.80,There's no words that can describe this experience.
791,00:33:38.83,00:33:38.83,"When it's all said and done,"
792,00:33:40.43,00:33:40.43,you know what I'm gonna tell people about this?
793,00:33:42.13,00:33:42.13,"You know, it changed my whole outlook on life in two weeks."
794,00:33:46.33,00:33:46.33,ERIN:  Everyone just kind of sat down
795,00:33:47.80,00:33:47.80," and poured out their feelings,"
796,00:33:49.37,00:33:49.37," which is something  that we really haven't done,"
797,00:33:51.37,00:33:51.37," but Robb talked about,  you know,"
798,00:33:54.03,00:33:54.03,what he's learned by being here
799,00:33:55.47,00:33:55.47,and it-it really made all of us think.
800,00:33:57.67,00:33:57.67,"ROBB: You know, before I left, you know"
801,00:33:58.87,00:33:58.87,what I thought was important to me?
802,00:33:59.93,00:33:59.93,How much money I made a week
803,00:34:01.53,00:34:01.53,and getting wasted...
804,00:34:03.70,00:34:03.70,"and within, like, five nights in here, I started really,"
805,00:34:07.60,00:34:07.60,"like... starting to think about things, man."
806,00:34:10.33,00:34:10.33,"Life is so important right now to me,"
807,00:34:12.87,00:34:12.87,"and family, you guys, is the most important thing in life."
808,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"The people you love, the people who love you just as much--"
809,00:34:18.80,00:34:18.80,that's what this is about.
810,00:34:20.57,00:34:20.57,You guys do not understand.
811,00:34:21.93,00:34:21.93,I didn't have a relationship with my dad for 21 years
812,00:34:24.47,00:34:24.47,"of my life, and now I miss him more than I miss anyone."
813,00:34:27.10,00:34:27.10,I want to go home and tell him
814,00:34:28.50,00:34:28.50,"how much I love him, and that's what I'm gonna"
815,00:34:30.03,00:34:30.03,"take away from this, no matter what happens."
816,00:34:32.03,00:34:32.03,I'm already going home a winner.
817,00:34:35.60,00:34:35.60,"JAKE:  I love people,"
818,00:34:37.40,00:34:37.40, and I like to see people make  breakthroughs
819,00:34:40.13,00:34:40.13," in their own lives,  like I know Robb had."
820,00:34:43.27,00:34:43.27,I think it'll be meaningful for him
821,00:34:44.97,00:34:44.97,for the rest of his life.
822,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93,ROBB: I never imagined I'd get out here
823,00:34:49.10,00:34:49.10,and really warm up to cherishing bananas.
824,00:34:52.57,00:34:52.57,-(laughs) -You know what I mean?
825,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,KEN: I'll tell you one thing that I never imagined--
826,00:34:55.93,00:34:55.93,that I'd be hanging out with a skateboarder freak.
827,00:34:58.80,00:34:58.80,(laughter)
828,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,"I tell you what, you're a good man."
829,00:35:02.67,00:35:02.67,I like you.
830,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,"ROBB: Amen, bro."
831,00:35:04.73,00:35:04.73,SHII ANN: Can I just say something?
832,00:35:06.03,00:35:06.03,"You and I have had our differences,"
833,00:35:07.10,00:35:07.10,"Robb, but I think you're"
834,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,"a really, really good guy."
835,00:35:11.00,00:35:11.00,-I appreciate that. -I just want you to know that.
836,00:35:12.87,00:35:12.87,"-Thank you, thank you very much. -Okay?"
837,00:35:21.63,00:35:21.63,(chicken clucking)
838,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,SHII ANN:  We had a great time last night.
839,00:35:32.57,00:35:32.57,"A lot of words were said that were never said before,"
840,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,"so it's kind of,"
841,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,it's kind of sappy but really sweet at the same time.
842,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"It's a shame, but that's the way it is."
843,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,SHII ANN:  But is it a love fest?
844,00:35:44.63,00:35:44.63, Is it a love tribe?  I don't think so.
845,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,"We love you, chicken. Thanks for giving your ultimate"
846,00:35:49.03,00:35:49.03,-for us. -(snapping)
847,00:35:53.13,00:35:53.13,"SHII ANN: I think it was  a little alcohol,"
848,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17, a little bit of remorse  for losing the game.
849,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87, I don't think it changes  the politics here.
850,00:35:59.80,00:35:59.80,I don't think that Penny and Erin trust me
851,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,one bit more than I trust them.
852,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33," This is a game,  and strategically we are"
853,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,still divided.
854,00:36:09.87,00:36:09.87,"PENNY: Hey, y'all, we're ready to eat."
855,00:36:11.87,00:36:11.87,-(Jake grunts) -It's so freaking hot.
856,00:36:15.43,00:36:15.43,SHII ANN: It's really hot.
857,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,JAKE: Voting at Tribal Council  is terribly painful for me.
858,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87," Just like this morning,"
859,00:36:22.40,00:36:22.40," I didn't want to kill  that chicken, but I knew that"
860,00:36:24.93,00:36:24.93, it's just one of those things  that we know
861,00:36:26.80,00:36:26.80," we have to do, and as painful"
862,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"as it is, somebody has to go."
863,00:36:51.77,00:36:51.77,"Hello, guys."
864,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,"Well, another interesting three days in the life of Sook Jai."
865,00:36:57.47,00:36:57.47,"A great win, a tough loss, and here you are again."
866,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,"Erin, tell me what's your take"
867,00:37:03.37,00:37:03.37,on the last three days?
868,00:37:04.77,00:37:04.77,The last three days
869,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,have been the most tumultuous that we've had
870,00:37:08.27,00:37:08.27,since we've been here.
871,00:37:09.63,00:37:09.63,We had our very best night that we've ever had
872,00:37:12.10,00:37:12.10,"when we won the feast,"
873,00:37:14.20,00:37:14.20,"and then the very next night we lost our immunity, and, uh,"
874,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,"it really touched all of us, I guess, in a..."
875,00:37:23.80,00:37:23.80,"in a really kind of emotional way,"
876,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"so we've, we've all had a really tough time with it."
877,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,"PROBST: So, Penny,"
878,00:37:29.53,00:37:29.53,"you go back to camp after losing the immunity challenge,"
879,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,and the tone completely changes.
880,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,Why was this different?
881,00:37:36.13,00:37:36.13,"Of all the games we played the last 18 days,"
882,00:37:38.87,00:37:38.87,"I think this one was the one we really wanted to win,"
883,00:37:42.80,00:37:42.80,"uh, just to keep the six of us here"
884,00:37:45.00,00:37:45.00,for three more nights together.
885,00:37:46.63,00:37:46.63,"Robb, tell me about the night through your eyes."
886,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,"It was... it was kind of hard,"
887,00:37:50.23,00:37:50.23,'cause for me sitting on the sidelines
888,00:37:51.67,00:37:51.67,"and watching them, watching them lose"
889,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,"and then seeing their reaction afterwards,"
890,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,"it was tough, you know?"
891,00:37:57.30,00:37:57.30,And I started thinking how thankful I was
892,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,"to be here and, uh,"
893,00:38:00.70,00:38:00.70,"how amazing this experience has been for me, absolutely amazing,"
894,00:38:03.50,00:38:03.50,so I thought I'd share it with them
895,00:38:04.73,00:38:04.73,"and try to uplift everyone's spirits, and"
896,00:38:07.57,00:38:07.57,the reaction I got out of them
897,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,was a lot more than I was hoping for.
898,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"Some people tucked away some tears, and"
899,00:38:14.20,00:38:14.20,all of us just-- I think all of us just really felt it.
900,00:38:17.97,00:38:17.97,"Well, I have to say, Sook Jai,"
901,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,I am genuinely delighted
902,00:38:22.10,00:38:22.10,for the experience you guys have had out here.
903,00:38:24.13,00:38:24.13,"So, how in the heck are you guys"
904,00:38:26.13,00:38:26.13,going to vote somebody out tonight?
905,00:38:27.90,00:38:27.90,Shii Ann?
906,00:38:29.17,00:38:29.17,Um...
907,00:38:32.20,00:38:32.20,"I think that tonight, uh,"
908,00:38:35.90,00:38:35.90,"is going to be really, really hard, and"
909,00:38:38.43,00:38:38.43,"I can't speak for anyone else, but I think that,"
910,00:38:41.40,00:38:41.40,"you know, the last two days have been, um, kind of"
911,00:38:46.03,00:38:46.03,so intimate that it's going to be
912,00:38:48.80,00:38:48.80,a very difficult vote tonight.
913,00:38:51.20,00:38:51.20,"PROBST: Erin,"
914,00:38:52.50,00:38:52.50,"is there a different way to put a spin on it, in that"
915,00:38:55.73,00:38:55.73,they're both wins?
916,00:38:57.07,00:38:57.07,"I get to play this amazing game,"
917,00:38:58.87,00:38:58.87,"which is all strategy, and can be conniving,"
918,00:39:01.93,00:39:01.93,"and yet in the midst of all of it, I'm having"
919,00:39:04.70,00:39:04.70,a life-changing experience.
920,00:39:06.80,00:39:06.80,I think Robb helped all of us to realize
921,00:39:09.47,00:39:09.47,what we've all actually gained
922,00:39:11.23,00:39:11.23,"from the 18 days that we've been here,"
923,00:39:13.27,00:39:13.27,and it's a lot more than any of us ever expected.
924,00:39:16.13,00:39:16.13,I think it really put us at peace
925,00:39:18.60,00:39:18.60,with making the decision that we have to vote for somebody.
926,00:39:22.37,00:39:22.37,"Jake, in all the things that have happened out here"
927,00:39:24.97,00:39:24.97,"in 18 days, where does tonight's vote rank?"
928,00:39:28.80,00:39:28.80,It's the worst.
929,00:39:30.33,00:39:30.33,"It's a very, very difficult vote for, I-I'm sure, for every"
930,00:39:34.20,00:39:34.20,"person in this room, and I wish we didn't have to."
931,00:39:36.67,00:39:36.67,I'll never forget these last few days with these six.
932,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,It is time to vote.
933,00:39:41.70,00:39:41.70,"Penny, you're first."
934,00:40:04.90,00:40:04.90,There's an old proverb:
935,00:40:06.90,00:40:06.90,"""A wise man knows much, but says little."
936,00:40:10.07,00:40:10.07,"A fool knows little, but says far too much."""
937,00:40:12.97,00:40:12.97,"Robb, I was just beginning to like you,"
938,00:40:15.40,00:40:15.40,but unfortunately you have to go.
939,00:40:18.07,00:40:18.07,"Sorry, buddy, no hard feelings."
940,00:40:38.27,00:40:38.27,(sighs)
941,00:40:39.27,00:40:39.27,"No hard feelings, baby."
942,00:40:40.30,00:40:40.30,I had to vote for somebody.
943,00:40:41.57,00:40:41.57,"We had our ups and downs,"
944,00:40:42.90,00:40:42.90,"but, uh, I'm definitely glad I got to know you."
945,00:40:54.10,00:40:54.10,I'll go tally the votes.
946,00:41:05.30,00:41:05.30,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
947,00:41:07.30,00:41:07.30,The person will be asked to leave
948,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,the Tribal Council area immediately.
949,00:41:10.37,00:41:10.37,I'll read the votes.
950,00:41:15.00,00:41:15.00,First vote-- Shii Ann.
951,00:41:22.97,00:41:22.97,Robb.
952,00:41:23.97,00:41:23.97,With two B's.
953,00:41:25.47,00:41:25.47,"Two B's, guys."
954,00:41:30.57,00:41:30.57,Robb.
955,00:41:33.63,00:41:33.63,Robb.
956,00:41:35.97,00:41:35.97,"That's three votes-- Robb, one vote-- Shii Ann."
957,00:41:41.93,00:41:41.93,Robb.
958,00:41:43.57,00:41:43.57,That's four votes. That's enough.
959,00:41:45.73,00:41:45.73,You need to bring me your torch.
960,00:41:55.03,00:41:55.03,"Robb, the tribe has spoken."
961,00:41:56.97,00:41:56.97,"Thanks, bro."
962,00:41:59.43,00:41:59.43,"Much love, dude."
963,00:42:01.30,00:42:01.30,You guys rule. Good luck.
964,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,"Play hard, dude."
965,00:42:04.80,00:42:04.80,"For real, you guys are all with me."
966,00:42:07.17,00:42:07.17,(Ken murmurs)
967,00:42:11.87,00:42:11.87,My hats are off to you.
968,00:42:13.87,00:42:13.87,Much love.

970,00:42:22.60,00:42:22.60,"you guys have experienced some real spiritual growth, and yet"
971,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93,it sounds like the person who inspired that growth
972,00:42:30.23,00:42:30.23,is the same person you just voted out.
973,00:42:33.00,00:42:33.00,"It's a great game, huh?"
974,00:42:34.43,00:42:34.43,You guys can head back to camp.
975,00:42:36.33,00:42:36.33,Good night.
