2,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33,Shii Ann's eating habits didn't
3,00:00:05.27,00:00:05.27, sit well with her Sook Jai tribe mates.
4,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37, ROBB: She's
5,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,repulsive.
6,00:00:09.07,00:00:09.07,"SHII ANN: Culturally, it's not an American thing to eat necks"
7,00:00:12.57,00:00:12.57," and hearts and gizzards.  In Taiwan,"
8,00:00:14.50,00:00:14.50,"it's considered a great,you know, snack."
9,00:00:16.93,00:00:16.93,Yech!
10,00:00:18.13,00:00:18.13,"PROBST: At Chuay Gahn, Brian and Ted made a pact."
11,00:00:20.97,00:00:20.97,One of the things we...we've got to kind of do is
12,00:00:22.90,00:00:22.90,have each other's back.
13,00:00:24.43,00:00:24.43," He's confirmed that, yes, he is totally committed"
14,00:00:26.60,00:00:26.60,to me all the way to the end.
15,00:00:27.80,00:00:27.80,-It's done.-It's done.
16,00:00:29.90,00:00:29.90,PROBST: Chuay Gahn experienced a setback when
17,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27, their fishing net and boat floated away into the night.
18,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43,-The boat's gone.-What?!
19,00:00:36.57,00:00:36.57, What do you mean
20,00:00:37.57,00:00:37.57,we lost the boat?! (groans)
21,00:00:39.67,00:00:39.67,"CLAY: If we don't find that boat, just for,"
22,00:00:41.30,00:00:41.30," to make it easier to go get water,"
23,00:00:42.80,00:00:42.80, I don't know what  we're gonna do.
24,00:00:47.87,00:00:47.87,PROBST: Chuay Gahn sucked it  up at the fish challenge
25,00:00:50.67,00:00:50.67, and won immunity.
26,00:00:51.80,00:00:51.80,-Chuay Gahn wins immunity!-(cheering)
27,00:00:55.10,00:00:55.10,"PROBST: Sook Jai went to Tribal Council,"
28,00:00:57.03,00:00:57.03," and although Shii Ann received two votes,"
29,00:00:59.50,00:00:59.50, Stephanie was voted  out of the tribe.
30,00:01:01.80,00:01:01.80,The tribe has spoken.
31,00:01:03.93,00:01:03.93, 11 are left.
32,00:01:05.93,00:01:05.93, Who will be the next to go?
33,00:02:30.87,00:02:30.87,"PENNY: I think in this game,you have to take it day by day."
34,00:02:34.43,00:02:34.43," Trust is something that does shift, especially as"
35,00:02:37.90,00:02:37.90," you do get further in the game, because"
36,00:02:40.20,00:02:40.20,we're all herefor a million dollars.
37,00:02:42.00,00:02:42.00,ERIN: Time to separate realityfrom the game out here.
38,00:02:46.13,00:02:46.13,"ROBB: Yeah, it is. I'm havinga little trouble with it."
39,00:02:48.63,00:02:48.63,'Cause I don't want to...I don't want to base my opinions
40,00:02:50.80,00:02:50.80,"of people about how they playthis, and I know I'm going to."
41,00:02:53.83,00:02:53.83,"PENNY: This morning when I got up,"
42,00:02:56.73,00:02:56.73," Robb said, ""Penny, let me ask you a question."""
43,00:03:00.07,00:03:00.07,"He said, ""Were you ever planningon voting me out last night?"""
44,00:03:02.50,00:03:02.50,"And I said, ""Absolutely not,100% never was I going"
45,00:03:05.73,00:03:05.73,"to write yourname down last night."""
46,00:03:07.53,00:03:07.53," And he said, ""Well, you know, that's kind of funny because"
47,00:03:10.60,00:03:10.60,"Ken said that you were going tovote for me or for Stephanie."""
48,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,"I don't know how much truthis being said, you know."
49,00:03:18.50,00:03:18.50,There's no reason to lie to me.
50,00:03:20.70,00:03:20.70,I don't likebackstabbing bull ...
51,00:03:23.67,00:03:23.67,PENNY: So I think Robb got very upset this morning
52,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23, thinking that maybe Ken
53,00:03:28.30,00:03:28.30,is playing two different sides.
54,00:03:30.03,00:03:30.03,"ROBB:Now I don't trust anybody,"
55,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,and Penny is telling meone thing.
56,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90,"So I'm not playing any gameshere, bro,"
57,00:03:35.97,00:03:35.97,"and I told you I've beenstraight up with you,"
58,00:03:38.80,00:03:38.80,so obviously... I don't know.
59,00:03:40.80,00:03:40.80,"I don't know when you guys weretalking, or I don't even..."
60,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,"I don't even care. To behonest with you, I don't care."
61,00:03:46.37,00:03:46.37, I was questioning Ken's trust and Ken's loyalty.
62,00:03:48.87,00:03:48.87," I didn't know if he was trying to mix everything up, and"
63,00:03:51.23,00:03:51.23, I didn't know what he was trying to achieve.
64,00:03:52.93,00:03:52.93,"So, I confronted him on it."
65,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,"You know what's bothering me?Straight up, I think"
66,00:03:57.00,00:03:57.00,you're playing a harder gamethan anyone here.
67,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,"-Oh, really?-Yeah, I do."
68,00:03:59.63,00:03:59.63,"Okay, so now,yesterday going in there,"
69,00:04:01.00,00:04:01.00,who did everybody else tell youto vote for?
70,00:04:03.07,00:04:03.07,"-Shii Ann.-Oh, okay."
71,00:04:04.80,00:04:04.80,-Who did everybody vote for?-Steph.
72,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,"Okay, who did I tell you I wasvoting for?"
73,00:04:09.23,00:04:09.23,Steph. Who did I vote for?Steph.
74,00:04:10.97,00:04:10.97,And now you got a problemwith me
75,00:04:12.77,00:04:12.77,because I was honest with you?
76,00:04:14.13,00:04:14.13,"Yeah, I don't wantto ... hear it, okay?"
77,00:04:16.13,00:04:16.13, I have no idea what started that. I didn't know
78,00:04:18.60,00:04:18.60, for the first five minutes that it was even
79,00:04:20.60,00:04:20.60, directed towards me.
80,00:04:21.73,00:04:21.73,And once I realized
81,00:04:22.73,00:04:22.73,"it was directed towards me,I thought he was kidding."
82,00:04:24.50,00:04:24.50,"What you just got finished doingis saying,"
83,00:04:26.30,00:04:26.30,"""You were the only one that washonest with me yesterday."
84,00:04:28.57,00:04:28.57,"You're playing a harder gamethan everybody."""
85,00:04:30.07,00:04:30.07,"Well, you know what?"
86,00:04:31.30,00:04:31.30,Don't ask me.That pisses me off.
87,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,"I wasn't ... like that.I don't ... act like that, dude."
88,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,All right?I'm not a little ... punk.
89,00:04:36.03,00:04:36.03,KEN: That's what you were actinglike last night.
90,00:04:37.30,00:04:37.30,Today I don't know... even know
91,00:04:38.30,00:04:38.30,what the hellyou're talking about.
92,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,"-I... -Hey, give mea straight answer."
93,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,"On the first vote, it wasbetween me and Jed, right?"
94,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,KEN:You're damn straight it was.
95,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,-You're damn ... right it was.-Really?
96,00:04:47.60,00:04:47.60,-According to who?-According to everybody.
97,00:04:49.07,00:04:49.07,They couldn't st... You wereannoying the ... out of
98,00:04:51.13,00:04:51.13,"everybody, becauseyou wouldn't shut up,"
99,00:04:52.43,00:04:52.43,you kept on runningyour mouth.
100,00:04:53.70,00:04:53.70,I think I already told you this.But you know what?
101,00:04:55.37,00:04:55.37,"I'm probably lying, right?"
102,00:04:56.57,00:04:56.57,"You told meif you heard anything,"
103,00:04:57.80,00:04:57.80,"you were going to say it to me,and you didn't tell me."
104,00:05:00.63,00:05:00.63,That was a week and a half ago.I don't know what the hell
105,00:05:02.20,00:05:02.20,you're bringing that up now for.
106,00:05:03.57,00:05:03.57,"Bro, because trust isinstilled early, and if it's..."
107,00:05:06.50,00:05:06.50,"... up early,then it's ... up forever."
108,00:05:08.37,00:05:08.37,I-I just think you got some setof balls
109,00:05:11.20,00:05:11.20,to approach me with this.
110,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,"I'm the only person that's beenstraight with you, and you just"
111,00:05:15.27,00:05:15.27,bit the ... hand that's beentrying to feed you. I-I...
112,00:05:17.20,00:05:17.20,You obviously heard somethingabout me before the first
113,00:05:18.73,00:05:18.73,Tribal Council that we had to goto. You didn't say a word to me
114,00:05:20.93,00:05:20.93,"-about it. -Okay, you shouldhave addressed it back then."
115,00:05:22.37,00:05:22.37,-Don't wait a... -That was thewhole basis of my argument.
116,00:05:24.10,00:05:24.10,"-Okay, well... -It's me thinkingthat you're not being truthful."
117,00:05:26.30,00:05:26.30,So don't ... try to tell me thatI'm doing something I'm not.
118,00:05:28.10,00:05:28.10,"-Hey, well, then, why didn't youask me? -All right?"
119,00:05:29.40,00:05:29.40,-'Cause I'm not ... stupid.-Why didn't you ask me?
120,00:05:31.47,00:05:31.47,Whatever.
121,00:05:35.60,00:05:35.60,Un ... believable.
122,00:05:40.87,00:05:40.87,"HELEN: Whoa! Drop off.All right, now..."
123,00:05:42.93,00:05:42.93,JAN:It's that big turn.
124,00:05:44.73,00:05:44.73,JAN: I do hate the fact that the boat's gone.
125,00:05:47.67,00:05:47.67," It's really not a bad swimto the water source. It's just,"
126,00:05:50.73,00:05:50.73,it's still three miles.
127,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37," You know, it pulls on your energy somewhat,"
128,00:05:54.33,00:05:54.33, whether you're aware of it or not.
129,00:05:56.20,00:05:56.20,You guys all right?
130,00:05:58.20,00:05:58.20,JAN:We're on our way!
131,00:06:00.10,00:06:00.10,BRIAN:How far out are they?
132,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,They'll be herein about five minutes.
133,00:06:04.87,00:06:04.87,Or less.
134,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,HELEN: The boat has been a
135,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,sore spot for everybodysince we got here.
136,00:06:12.87,00:06:12.87," And then, the last time we used it,"
137,00:06:15.27,00:06:15.27," um, the guys thoughtthat they had it pretty secure,"
138,00:06:18.00,00:06:18.00, but the tide rose very high
139,00:06:21.63,00:06:21.63,and took our boat in the middleof the night.
140,00:06:24.07,00:06:24.07,"BRIAN:How was it, girls?"
141,00:06:25.63,00:06:25.63,JAN:It wasn't bad. She led the way
142,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,"going, I pushed the thing."
143,00:06:29.07,00:06:29.07,"HELEN: For the last several days, it's been a mystery."
144,00:06:32.00,00:06:32.00," You know, where's the boat?"
145,00:06:33.50,00:06:33.50, Is the boat going to float back? Is the boat sunk?
146,00:06:35.43,00:06:35.43,Is the boat on another shore?
147,00:06:37.10,00:06:37.10,"TED: Oh, boat, pleasejust show up somewhere."
148,00:06:41.63,00:06:41.63,I think it's on the back sideof that island.
149,00:06:43.03,00:06:43.03,Can't get over there.
150,00:06:44.27,00:06:44.27,I think it's aroundthat island somewhere.
151,00:06:45.73,00:06:45.73,CLAY: The only other place it could be
152,00:06:48.50,00:06:48.50," is over this island across, you know,"
153,00:06:50.37,00:06:50.37," a mile over there, and, uh,"
154,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,so we decided to swim overand look around for the boat.
155,00:06:54.80,00:06:54.80,"BRIAN: We'll just head straighttowards the island, you know?"
156,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17,"-TED: Yeah. -HELEN: You know,sometimes over water,"
157,00:06:59.93,00:06:59.93,land appears closerthan it actually is.
158,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,JAN:That's a long way.
159,00:07:04.20,00:07:04.20,That is a long way.
160,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,"TED: The current is getting kindof strong, hmm?"
161,00:07:10.07,00:07:10.07,CLAY: I don't have enough airto float.
162,00:07:11.53,00:07:11.53,BRIAN: We got it.This is fun.
163,00:07:13.37,00:07:13.37,HELEN: I think they got hopes that
164,00:07:15.23,00:07:15.23," maybe they'll find the boat over there, but, you know,"
165,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17," Brian's a good swimmer,"
166,00:07:18.60,00:07:18.60,but even good swimmers getinto trouble.
167,00:07:20.37,00:07:20.37,The other two are not even whatI would classify as swimmers.
168,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83," Um, Clay did take a float with him,"
169,00:07:25.63,00:07:25.63,and Ted was justout there on his own.
170,00:07:27.43,00:07:27.43,BRIAN: He didn't knowwhere he was going.
171,00:07:30.00,00:07:30.00,-CLAY: Ted!-TED: Yo!
172,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,-CLAY: It's this way!-BRIAN: This way. -TED: Oh.
173,00:07:33.87,00:07:33.87,My bad.
174,00:07:35.77,00:07:35.77,I didn't realize I was swimmingin the wrong direction.
175,00:07:38.03,00:07:38.03,Keep doing the breast stroke.Breast stroke for it here.
176,00:07:40.60,00:07:40.60,This is the most swimmingI've ever done in my life.
177,00:07:43.63,00:07:43.63,"And each day,"
178,00:07:45.27,00:07:45.27,my skills are getting better andbetter and better and better.
179,00:07:48.60,00:07:48.60,I'm just at whale speed.Whale speed.
180,00:07:51.63,00:07:51.63,"CLAY:  The harder we'd swim, it just"
181,00:07:54.03,00:07:54.03," seemed like, uh, we weren't going anywhere."
182,00:07:55.63,00:07:55.63," The island was getting further away, or staying right there."
183,00:07:57.93,00:07:57.93," We wasn't leaving this beach,"
184,00:07:59.30,00:07:59.30," and I got about halfway there, and I thought, ""Man!"
185,00:08:01.23,00:08:01.23,"I'm not too sure I'm too proudI decided to come do this."""
186,00:08:05.97,00:08:05.97,-CLAY: Can you stand up?-TED: Yeah.
187,00:08:08.30,00:08:08.30,Got any rocks or anything?
188,00:08:10.23,00:08:10.23,There is a cove down this way.
189,00:08:12.03,00:08:12.03,"CLAY:We'll never see this ... again,"
190,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,"but if I ever do, I'm going tohave a hamburger in my backpack."
191,00:08:16.77,00:08:16.77,-BRIAN: Uh-huh.-(Ted laughs)
192,00:08:17.97,00:08:17.97,"CLAY: And then, you know,"
193,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67," you're there, you're onlyhalfway through, 'cause you got"
194,00:08:21.93,00:08:21.93, to turn around and come back.
195,00:08:23.40,00:08:23.40," Oh, man, if I'd had a little bitty pillow,"
196,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,I'd lay down on that islandand stayed right there.
197,00:08:29.10,00:08:29.10,BRIAN: I just swam ahead to try to find out if there's
198,00:08:31.83,00:08:31.83, another beach around the actual point of the island
199,00:08:33.83,00:08:33.83, to see if I could find a boat.
200,00:08:35.20,00:08:35.20,No boat in sight anywhere.
201,00:08:36.57,00:08:36.57,"Well, we covered everythingthat we could possibly cover."
202,00:08:40.03,00:08:40.03,I think the boatis halfway to Malaysia.
203,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60,"BRIAN:I think so, too."
204,00:08:47.57,00:08:47.57,"CLAY: It's not here. Far as I know, it's not in this whole"
205,00:08:50.37,00:08:50.37,side of the world.It's-It's gone.
206,00:08:55.47,00:08:55.47, I don't think anybody wants
207,00:08:57.10,00:08:57.10,to talk aboutthat boat no more.
208,00:09:06.20,00:09:06.20,(chickens clucking)
209,00:09:19.80,00:09:19.80,"ROBB:I'm starving, bro."
210,00:09:21.53,00:09:21.53,KEN:So?
211,00:09:27.90,00:09:27.90,Right there is a good one.
212,00:09:29.67,00:09:29.67,"Dude, just relax."
213,00:09:32.27,00:09:32.27,I'm over it.
214,00:09:33.37,00:09:33.37,KEN:Unbelievable.
215,00:09:34.60,00:09:34.60,(laughs)
216,00:09:36.93,00:09:36.93,"KEN: We had all agreed to not touch the bananas,"
217,00:09:40.30,00:09:40.30," wait till they get ripe,"
218,00:09:41.53,00:09:41.53, because Robb's  capable of eating
219,00:09:42.73,00:09:42.73,"30 bananas a day, Penny's not,"
220,00:09:44.37,00:09:44.37,so we're going to do itin a fair manner.
221,00:09:46.30,00:09:46.30,KEN: What's the deal?Are we eating the bananas?
222,00:09:47.80,00:09:47.80,Are we not eating the bananas?How's this work?
223,00:09:49.57,00:09:49.57,PENNY:I don't know.
224,00:09:50.67,00:09:50.67,We're waiting on the bananas.

227,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,"ROBB: I was hungry, so I had a banana."
228,00:09:57.63,00:09:57.63, I don't think anyone wants to have to ask somebody
229,00:10:00.17,00:10:00.17, if they can have a banana.
230,00:10:01.53,00:10:01.53," We want them, we're going to enjoy them."
231,00:10:03.30,00:10:03.30,"We worked really hardfor that food,"
232,00:10:05.07,00:10:05.07, but Ken just took it upon himself
233,00:10:06.73,00:10:06.73, to be the policeman out here.
234,00:10:08.90,00:10:08.90,"So what is this,a free-for-all on the bananas?"
235,00:10:11.20,00:10:11.20,"-Is that how we're doing it?-ROBB: Yeah, I'm talking about,"
236,00:10:13.10,00:10:13.10,"when we're hungry, eat a banana."
237,00:10:14.67,00:10:14.67,"People are going to be hungry,they're going to eat a banana."
238,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50,It's not likeI'm gonna walk around
239,00:10:17.73,00:10:17.73,with four bananas in my hand
240,00:10:18.90,00:10:18.90,and sit down and eatall four of them.
241,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,"Are we just eatingthe bananas whenever, then?"
242,00:10:22.37,00:10:22.37,All I know is that we workedhard for those bananas.
243,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,"If we're going to eat them,we're going to eat them."

247,00:10:29.87,00:10:29.87,I don't even wantto hear the word.
248,00:10:31.17,00:10:31.17,"I'm not trying to squabbleabout the bananas,"

594,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,because I know he's not doingtoo well out here.
595,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73,"ROBB:Hey, for real, though,"
596,00:25:25.70,00:25:25.70,"I really appreciateyou talking to me, Ken."
597,00:25:28.00,00:25:28.00,"Now that we go back,you're feeling a lot better,"

600,00:25:33.70,00:25:33.70, It was good.
601,00:25:35.40,00:25:35.40,I guess it was like hanging outwith an older brother.
602,00:25:44.80,00:25:44.80," JAN: Helen, we have to have a funeral."
603,00:25:46.90,00:25:46.90,HELEN:Why?
604,00:25:47.90,00:25:47.90,I found a baby bat.
605,00:25:50.23,00:25:50.23,-Aw...-And it's dead.
606,00:25:52.00,00:25:52.00,"I have it hiddenso y'all can see it,"
607,00:25:55.03,00:25:55.03,and we're going to bury itwith a cross.
608,00:25:57.37,00:25:57.37,HELEN: Jan was all upset 'cause she found
609,00:25:59.00,00:25:59.00," this, uh-- really, I would"
610,00:26:01.67,00:26:01.67,not even call it a baby bat yet;it was still embryonic stage--
611,00:26:05.07,00:26:05.07,"um, slimy, littlebaby bat thing."
612,00:26:07.23,00:26:07.23,"Oh, God."

622,00:26:27.97,00:26:27.97,I'll send a cardand some flowers.

624,00:26:33.63,00:26:33.63," and named it Oscar, and was quite sad"
625,00:26:36.40,00:26:36.40, about the little bat that I was curious
626,00:26:38.73,00:26:38.73,if we could eat it or not--
627,00:26:39.80,00:26:39.80,that was my first wordsout of my mouth.
628,00:26:41.27,00:26:41.27,"JAN:Oh, poor baby."
629,00:26:43.17,00:26:43.17,"Didn't have a chance,did you, baby?"
630,00:26:45.53,00:26:45.53,"BRIAN: But again, I don't know"
631,00:26:47.63,00:26:47.63," if that's just Jan being emotional or if, uh,"
632,00:26:50.50,00:26:50.50,she's actually losing ita little bit out here.
633,00:26:53.63,00:26:53.63,"JAN: I know it's silly, but"
634,00:26:55.70,00:26:55.70,"I feel sorry for him,so I buried him and he's happy."
635,00:26:59.20,00:26:59.20,(laughs) And I'll quit cryingin a minute.
636,00:27:02.07,00:27:02.07,"But I'm very sensitive, so--especially about little animals"
637,00:27:04.80,00:27:04.80,that are-- don't have a chance.

649,00:27:29.60,00:27:29.60," I mean, today we received an interesting treemail."
650,00:27:32.47,00:27:32.47, And I think this one is going to be
651,00:27:34.30,00:27:34.30,"more of a mental challenge,no matter what it is."
652,00:27:36.63,00:27:36.63,"21, so it could be 21 blackjack."
653,00:27:39.53,00:27:39.53,"CLAY:Oh, yeah."
654,00:27:40.53,00:27:40.53,"The merge has to be happeningin the next three to four days,"
655,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50, so it's extremely important
656,00:27:44.97,00:27:44.97," that this tribe wins, 'cause if it doesn't,"
657,00:27:47.43,00:27:47.43,they can sit thereand pick us off one by one
658,00:27:49.47,00:27:49.47,and get downto just their tribe.
659,00:27:58.50,00:27:58.50,"PROBST: Welcome, guys.First things first--"
660,00:28:00.50,00:28:00.50,"as always, give it up, Jan."
661,00:28:02.47,00:28:02.47,"Oh, I hate to."
662,00:28:03.47,00:28:03.47,-(laughs)-PROBST: Immunity--
663,00:28:05.50,00:28:05.50,the most coveted prize inthis game-- back up for grabs.
664,00:28:08.97,00:28:08.97,"To win it, you simply haveto outsmart the other tribe."
665,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,Today's challenge is all mental.
666,00:28:13.53,00:28:13.53,It's called Thai 21.
667,00:28:15.40,00:28:15.40,Here's how it works.
668,00:28:16.67,00:28:16.67,There are 21 flagsin this circle.
669,00:28:19.00,00:28:19.00,Your goal-- be the tribeto get the last flag.
670,00:28:23.33,00:28:23.33,"Here's the twist-- on each move,"
671,00:28:25.27,00:28:25.27,"you can only grabone, two, or three flags,"
672,00:28:29.27,00:28:29.27,so clearly the strategy liesin determining
673,00:28:32.40,00:28:32.40,how many flags to graband when to grab them.
674,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,"Sook Jai, because you haveone extra member,"
675,00:28:37.93,00:28:37.93,you're sitting somebody out.
676,00:28:38.93,00:28:38.93,"-Robb, plant it on the big rock.-(Robb mutters)"
677,00:28:41.73,00:28:41.73,"Guys, take a seat on yourbenches, start strategizing."
678,00:28:44.27,00:28:44.27,-Wait for my go.-ERIN: And we can take two.
679,00:28:46.37,00:28:46.37,"-We can take two and we win.-We, we want"
680,00:28:47.70,00:28:47.70,-the last flag.-You understand?
681,00:28:49.07,00:28:49.07,"At the end, we want to make surethere's four flags."
682,00:28:51.27,00:28:51.27,"-CLAY: Five or four?-Five. -No, four."
683,00:28:52.67,00:28:52.67,"PROBST:Here we go, guys."
684,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,"Sook Jai, you won the coin toss,you elected to go first."
685,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,Make your first move.
686,00:28:58.83,00:28:58.83,"You must grab one, two,or three flags."
687,00:29:01.53,00:29:01.53,Sook Jai electing to grab two.
688,00:29:10.83,00:29:10.83,"Sook Jai takes two flags ontheir first move, leaving 19."
689,00:29:14.47,00:29:14.47,"Chuay Gahn, make your move."
690,00:29:19.00,00:29:19.00,Chuay Gahn also takes two.
691,00:29:22.67,00:29:22.67,Very simple gamewith huge consequences.
692,00:29:26.93,00:29:26.93,"After one round,we're down to 17 flags."

695,00:29:36.00,00:29:36.00,"Chuay Gahn, make your move."
696,00:29:37.17,00:29:37.17,I hope that's right.
697,00:29:39.00,00:29:39.00,PROBST:Chuay Gahn takes one.
698,00:29:41.67,00:29:41.67,We're down to 14 flags.

702,00:29:52.10,00:29:52.10,We are down to 12 flags.

704,00:29:55.23,00:29:55.23,-on odds.-She wants to take one.

708,00:30:01.47,00:30:01.47,Make it.

719,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,So I think we're looking good.

723,00:30:40.03,00:30:40.03,"Got to make a move, guys."
724,00:30:41.40,00:30:41.40,"One, two, or three flags."

792,00:33:42.13,00:33:42.13,"You know, it changed my wholeoutlook on life in two weeks."
793,00:33:46.33,00:33:46.33,ERIN: Everyone just kind of sat down
794,00:33:47.80,00:33:47.80," and poured out their feelings,"
795,00:33:49.37,00:33:49.37," which is something that we really haven't done,"
796,00:33:51.37,00:33:51.37," but Robb talked about, you know,"
797,00:33:54.03,00:33:54.03,what he's learned by being here
798,00:33:55.47,00:33:55.47,and it-it really madeall of us think.
799,00:33:57.67,00:33:57.67,"ROBB: You know,before I left, you know"
800,00:33:58.87,00:33:58.87,what I thought wasimportant to me?
801,00:33:59.93,00:33:59.93,How much money I made a week
802,00:34:01.53,00:34:01.53,and getting wasted...
803,00:34:03.70,00:34:03.70,"and within, like, five nightsin here, I started really,"
804,00:34:07.60,00:34:07.60,"like... starting to thinkabout things, man."
805,00:34:10.33,00:34:10.33,"Life is so importantright now to me,"
806,00:34:12.87,00:34:12.87,"and family, you guys, is themost important thing in life."
807,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"The people you love, the peoplewho love you just as much--"
808,00:34:18.80,00:34:18.80,that's what this is about.
809,00:34:20.57,00:34:20.57,You guys do not understand.
810,00:34:21.93,00:34:21.93,I didn't have a relationshipwith my dad for 21 years
811,00:34:24.47,00:34:24.47,"of my life, and now I miss himmore than I miss anyone."
812,00:34:27.10,00:34:27.10,I want to go home and tell him
813,00:34:28.50,00:34:28.50,"how much I love him,and that's what I'm gonna"
814,00:34:30.03,00:34:30.03,"take away from this,no matter what happens."
815,00:34:32.03,00:34:32.03,I'm already going home a winner.
816,00:34:35.60,00:34:35.60,"JAKE: I love people,"
817,00:34:37.40,00:34:37.40, and I like to see people make breakthroughs
818,00:34:40.13,00:34:40.13," in their own lives, like I know Robb had."
819,00:34:43.27,00:34:43.27,I think it'll bemeaningful for him
820,00:34:44.97,00:34:44.97,for the rest of his life.
821,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93,ROBB: I never imaginedI'd get out here
822,00:34:49.10,00:34:49.10,and really warm upto cherishing bananas.
823,00:34:52.57,00:34:52.57,-(laughs)-You know what I mean?
824,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,KEN: I'll tell you one thingthat I never imagined--
825,00:34:55.93,00:34:55.93,that I'd be hanging outwith a skateboarder freak.
826,00:34:58.80,00:34:58.80,(laughter)
827,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,"I tell you what,you're a good man."
828,00:35:02.67,00:35:02.67,I like you.
829,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,"ROBB:Amen, bro."
830,00:35:04.73,00:35:04.73,SHII ANN:Can I just say something?
831,00:35:06.03,00:35:06.03,"You and I have hadour differences,"
832,00:35:07.10,00:35:07.10,"Robb, but I think you're"
833,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,"a really, really good guy."
834,00:35:11.00,00:35:11.00,-I appreciate that.-I just want you to know that.
835,00:35:12.87,00:35:12.87,"-Thank you, thank you very much.-Okay?"
836,00:35:21.63,00:35:21.63,(chicken clucking)
837,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,SHII ANN: We had a great time last night.
838,00:35:32.57,00:35:32.57,"A lot of words were saidthat were never said before,"
839,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,"so it's kind of,"
840,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,it's kind of sappy butreally sweet at the same time.
841,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"It's a shame,but that's the way it is."
842,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,SHII ANN: But is it a love fest?
843,00:35:44.63,00:35:44.63, Is it a love tribe? I don't think so.
844,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,"We love you, chicken.Thanks for giving your ultimate"
845,00:35:49.03,00:35:49.03,-for us.-(snapping)
846,00:35:53.13,00:35:53.13,"SHII ANN: I think it was a little alcohol,"
847,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17, a little bit of remorse for losing the game.
848,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87, I don't think it changes the politics here.
849,00:35:59.80,00:35:59.80,I don't thinkthat Penny and Erin trust me
850,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,one bit more than I trust them.
851,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33," This is a game, and strategically we are"
852,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,still divided.
853,00:36:09.87,00:36:09.87,"PENNY:Hey, y'all, we're ready to eat."
854,00:36:11.87,00:36:11.87,-(Jake grunts)-It's so freaking hot.
855,00:36:15.43,00:36:15.43,SHII ANN:It's really hot.
856,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,JAKE: Voting at Tribal Council is terribly painful for me.
857,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87," Just like this morning,"
858,00:36:22.40,00:36:22.40," I didn't want to kill that chicken, but I knew that"
859,00:36:24.93,00:36:24.93, it's just one of those things that we know
860,00:36:26.80,00:36:26.80," we have to do, and as painful"
861,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"as it is, somebody has to go."
862,00:36:51.77,00:36:51.77,"Hello, guys."
863,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,"Well, another interesting threedays in the life of Sook Jai."
864,00:36:57.47,00:36:57.47,"A great win, a tough loss,and here you are again."
865,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,"Erin, tell me what's your take"
866,00:37:03.37,00:37:03.37,on the last three days?
867,00:37:04.77,00:37:04.77,The last three days
868,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,have been the most tumultuousthat we've had
869,00:37:08.27,00:37:08.27,since we've been here.
870,00:37:09.63,00:37:09.63,We had our very best nightthat we've ever had
871,00:37:12.10,00:37:12.10,"when we won the feast,"
872,00:37:14.20,00:37:14.20,"and then the very next nightwe lost our immunity, and, uh,"
873,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,"it really touched all of us,I guess, in a..."
874,00:37:23.80,00:37:23.80,"in a really kindof emotional way,"
875,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"so we've, we've all hada really tough time with it."
876,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,"PROBST:So, Penny,"
877,00:37:29.53,00:37:29.53,"you go back to camp after losingthe immunity challenge,"
878,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,and the tone completely changes.
879,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,Why was this different?
880,00:37:36.13,00:37:36.13,"Of all the games we playedthe last 18 days,"
881,00:37:38.87,00:37:38.87,"I think this one was the onewe really wanted to win,"
882,00:37:42.80,00:37:42.80,"uh, just to keepthe six of us here"
883,00:37:45.00,00:37:45.00,for three more nights together.
884,00:37:46.63,00:37:46.63,"Robb, tell me about the nightthrough your eyes."
885,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,"It was... it was kind of hard,"
886,00:37:50.23,00:37:50.23,'cause for me sittingon the sidelines
887,00:37:51.67,00:37:51.67,"and watching them,watching them lose"
888,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,"and then seeingtheir reaction afterwards,"
889,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,"it was tough, you know?"
890,00:37:57.30,00:37:57.30,And I started thinkinghow thankful I was
891,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,"to be here and, uh,"
892,00:38:00.70,00:38:00.70,"how amazing this experience hasbeen for me, absolutely amazing,"
893,00:38:03.50,00:38:03.50,so I thoughtI'd share it with them
894,00:38:04.73,00:38:04.73,"and try to uplifteveryone's spirits, and"
895,00:38:07.57,00:38:07.57,the reaction I got out of them
896,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,was a lot morethan I was hoping for.
897,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"Some people tucked awaysome tears, and"
898,00:38:14.20,00:38:14.20,all of us just-- I thinkall of us just really felt it.
899,00:38:17.97,00:38:17.97,"Well, I have to say, Sook Jai,"
900,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,I am genuinely delighted
901,00:38:22.10,00:38:22.10,for the experienceyou guys have had out here.
902,00:38:24.13,00:38:24.13,"So, how in the heck are you guys"
903,00:38:26.13,00:38:26.13,going to votesomebody out tonight?
904,00:38:27.90,00:38:27.90,Shii Ann?
905,00:38:29.17,00:38:29.17,Um...
906,00:38:32.20,00:38:32.20,"I think that tonight, uh,"
907,00:38:35.90,00:38:35.90,"is going to be really,really hard, and"
908,00:38:38.43,00:38:38.43,"I can't speak for anyone else,but I think that,"
909,00:38:41.40,00:38:41.40,"you know, the last two dayshave been, um, kind of"
910,00:38:46.03,00:38:46.03,so intimatethat it's going to be
911,00:38:48.80,00:38:48.80,a very difficult vote tonight.
912,00:38:51.20,00:38:51.20,"PROBST:Erin,"
913,00:38:52.50,00:38:52.50,"is there a different wayto put a spin on it, in that"
914,00:38:55.73,00:38:55.73,they're both wins?
915,00:38:57.07,00:38:57.07,"I get to play this amazing game,"
916,00:38:58.87,00:38:58.87,"which is all strategy,and can be conniving,"
917,00:39:01.93,00:39:01.93,"and yet in the midstof all of it, I'm having"
918,00:39:04.70,00:39:04.70,a life-changing experience.
919,00:39:06.80,00:39:06.80,I think Robb helped all of usto realize
920,00:39:09.47,00:39:09.47,what we've all actually gained
921,00:39:11.23,00:39:11.23,"from the 18 daysthat we've been here,"
922,00:39:13.27,00:39:13.27,and it's a lot morethan any of us ever expected.
923,00:39:16.13,00:39:16.13,I think it really put usat peace
924,00:39:18.60,00:39:18.60,with making the decision thatwe have to vote for somebody.
925,00:39:22.37,00:39:22.37,"Jake, in all the things thathave happened out here"
926,00:39:24.97,00:39:24.97,"in 18 days,where does tonight's vote rank?"
927,00:39:28.80,00:39:28.80,It's the worst.
928,00:39:30.33,00:39:30.33,"It's a very, very difficult votefor, I-I'm sure, for every"
929,00:39:34.20,00:39:34.20,"person in this room,and I wish we didn't have to."
930,00:39:36.67,00:39:36.67,I'll never forget these lastfew days with these six.
931,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,It is time to vote.
932,00:39:41.70,00:39:41.70,"Penny, you're first."
933,00:40:04.90,00:40:04.90,There's an old proverb:
934,00:40:06.90,00:40:06.90,"""A wise man knows much,but says little."
935,00:40:10.07,00:40:10.07,"A fool knows little,but says far too much."""
936,00:40:12.97,00:40:12.97,"Robb, I was just beginningto like you,"
937,00:40:15.40,00:40:15.40,but unfortunatelyyou have to go.
938,00:40:18.07,00:40:18.07,"Sorry, buddy, no hard feelings."
939,00:40:38.27,00:40:38.27,(sighs)
940,00:40:39.27,00:40:39.27,"No hard feelings, baby."
941,00:40:40.30,00:40:40.30,I had to vote for somebody.
942,00:40:41.57,00:40:41.57,"We had our ups and downs,"
943,00:40:42.90,00:40:42.90,"but, uh, I'm definitely gladI got to know you."
944,00:40:54.10,00:40:54.10,I'll go tally the votes.
945,00:41:05.30,00:41:05.30,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
946,00:41:07.30,00:41:07.30,The person will be askedto leave
947,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
948,00:41:10.37,00:41:10.37,I'll read the votes.
949,00:41:15.00,00:41:15.00,First vote-- Shii Ann.
950,00:41:22.97,00:41:22.97,Robb.
951,00:41:23.97,00:41:23.97,With two B's.
952,00:41:25.47,00:41:25.47,"Two B's, guys."
953,00:41:30.57,00:41:30.57,Robb.
954,00:41:33.63,00:41:33.63,Robb.
955,00:41:35.97,00:41:35.97,"That's three votes-- Robb,one vote-- Shii Ann."
956,00:41:41.93,00:41:41.93,Robb.
957,00:41:43.57,00:41:43.57,That's four votes.That's enough.
958,00:41:45.73,00:41:45.73,You need to bring me your torch.
959,00:41:55.03,00:41:55.03,"Robb, the tribe has spoken."
960,00:41:56.97,00:41:56.97,"Thanks, bro."
961,00:41:59.43,00:41:59.43,"Much love, dude."

963,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,"Play hard, dude."
964,00:42:04.80,00:42:04.80,"For real,you guys are all with me."

966,00:42:11.87,00:42:11.87,My hats are off to you.

969,00:42:22.60,00:42:22.60,"you guys have experienced somereal spiritual growth, and yet"
970,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93,it sounds like the personwho inspired that growth
971,00:42:30.23,00:42:30.23,is the same personyou just voted out.
972,00:42:33.00,00:42:33.00,"It's a great game, huh?"
973,00:42:34.43,00:42:34.43,You guys can head back to camp.

987,00:43:23.93,00:43:23.93, This experience has forever broadened my horizons
988,00:43:27.87,00:43:27.87, and made me think of the importance
989,00:43:29.87,00:43:29.87, of family and life and love.
