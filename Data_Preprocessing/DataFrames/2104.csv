21,00:00:42.25,00:00:42.25,BECAUSE WHILE JIMMY T. DISTRACTED THE OLDER TRIBE...

34,00:01:12.17,00:01:12.17,BECAUSE I AM A LEADER WHERE I COME FROM.

36,00:01:16.21,00:01:16.21,THE WEAKEST PLAYERS BUT ONLY JIMMY WOULD ADMIT TO IT.

40,00:01:26.67,00:01:26.67,THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
41,00:01:28.88,00:01:28.88,IN VOTING OUT JIMMY JOHNSON YOU VOTE OUT A PROVEN LEADER.
42,00:01:33.08,00:01:33.08,WHO'S GOING TO STEP UP AND FILL THOSE SHOES?
43,00:01:35.25,00:01:35.25,17 ARE LEFT.
44,00:01:36.75,00:01:36.75,WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
45,00:01:52.17,00:01:52.17,>> HOW ABOUT YOU?

48,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,>> YEAH.
49,00:01:59.08,00:01:59.08,">> WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
50,00:02:04.17,00:02:04.17,THE LEADERSHIP THAT JIMMY JOHNSON SUPPLIED
51,00:02:07.29,00:02:07.29,IN EVERYBODY'S EYES WAS NOTHING.
52,00:02:10.12,00:02:10.12,HE GAVE A COUPLE OF CHEERLEADER SPEECHES
53,00:02:12.17,00:02:12.17,THAT ANY CHUCKLEHEAD COULD DO.
54,00:02:13.83,00:02:13.83,HE DIDN'T PUT HIS BEST PEOPLE FORWARD.
55,00:02:16.17,00:02:16.17,HE DEFINITELY WASN'T A JIMMY T. FAN
56,00:02:18.29,00:02:18.29,AND I WASN'T GOING TO GET A LOT OF PLAYING TIME
57,00:02:20.12,00:02:20.12,WITH HIM CALLING THE SHOTS AND IF HE WAS A PLAYER
58,00:02:23.17,00:02:23.17,"HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON MY ALLIANCE, THAT'S FOR SURE."
59,00:02:25.58,00:02:25.58,SO I'M NOT GOING TO MISS HIM TOO MUCH.
60,00:02:28.38,00:02:28.38,BAD WAVES PASSING ON THE BEACH
61,00:02:31.08,00:02:31.08,AND FOR ONE DESPERATE MOMENT.
62,00:02:34.96,00:02:34.96,"HE CAME BACK IN OUR MEMORY,"
63,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,"GUY'S SO CRAZY, SO CLOSE."
64,00:02:44.29,00:02:44.29,AND STILL JUST OUT OF REACH...
65,00:02:48.46,00:02:48.46,">> JIMMY T. IS PUTTING ON THE JIMMY T. SHOW,"
66,00:02:51.00,00:02:51.00,"ANNOYING, SINGING, TRYING TO DO HIS BEST."
67,00:02:53.21,00:02:53.21,"IT IS JIMMY T., MAN, THAT'S WHO THIS GUY IS."
68,00:02:55.21,00:02:55.21,"HE'S A LOUD MOUTH, HE JUST..."
69,00:02:58.50,00:02:58.50,HE HAS TO HEAR HIS OWN VOICE 24/7.
70,00:03:01.25,00:03:01.25,"  TAKE IT EASY, BABY, MAKE IT LAST NIGHT, LAST ALL NIGHT..."
71,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,>> IT'S JUST...
72,00:03:06.71,00:03:06.71,THIS GAME TRIES YOUR PATIENCE IN SO MANY WAYS
73,00:03:10.58,00:03:10.58,AND THAT GUY'S JUST...
74,00:03:12.79,00:03:12.79,IT'S JUST OBNOXIOUS.
75,00:03:14.67,00:03:14.67,SO I MEAN ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO WITH JIMMY T.
76,00:03:16.83,00:03:16.83,IS GIVE HIM JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ROPE.
77,00:03:18.25,00:03:18.25,THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS AND HE'LL HANG HIMSELF
78,00:03:19.25,00:03:19.25,FROM THE NEAREST BRANCH.
79,00:03:52.62,00:03:52.62,">> WOW, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY."
80,00:03:59.33,00:03:59.33,>> SOMEPLACE ON NICARAGUA
81,00:04:01.92,00:04:01.92,THEY MUST HAVE HAD EIGHT OR TEN INCHES OF RAIN
82,00:04:04.08,00:04:04.08,AND ALL THAT WATER WE'VE HAD
83,00:04:06.75,00:04:06.75,MIXED WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
84,00:04:09.00,00:04:09.00,OBVIOUSLY IS JUST COME ON DOWN
85,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17,AND FOUND ITS WAY BACK TO THE OCEAN.
86,00:04:14.25,00:04:14.25,>> THE ENTIRE BEACH IS JUST COVERED WITH DEBRIS.
87,00:04:17.71,00:04:17.71,ALL SORTS OF WOOD AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
88,00:04:19.04,00:04:19.04,"AS A MATTER OF FACT, OUR BEACHFRONT HERE IS GONE."
89,00:04:21.08,00:04:21.08,YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN THERE.
90,00:04:22.62,00:04:22.62,AND IT'S ALL COVERED WITH MUD.
91,00:04:24.88,00:04:24.88,THE OCEAN'S ALL FILLED WITH MUD.
92,00:04:27.17,00:04:27.17,IT'S REALLY A MESS.
93,00:04:29.42,00:04:29.42,>> IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY AND A HALF FOR ME.
94,00:04:30.75,00:04:30.75,I BURNT MY FOOT AND COOKED MY SNEAKERS.
95,00:04:33.96,00:04:33.96,>> COOKED YOUR SHOE!
96,00:04:35.25,00:04:35.25,TOO BAD WE CAN'T EAT YOUR SHOE.
97,00:04:38.75,00:04:38.75,FILLET OF SOLE.
98,00:04:39.75,00:04:39.75,(\\LAUGHS\\).
99,00:04:40.75,00:04:40.75,>> THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.
100,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,WE DON'T GET FOOD SOON WE'RE GOING TO BE EATING MY FOOT.
101,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,THIS PLACE IS GOD FORSAKEN.
102,00:04:48.83,00:04:48.83,>> IT IS. IT'S JINXED.
103,00:04:51.42,00:04:51.42,>> FOOD IS A HUGE ISSUE.
104,00:04:53.50,00:04:53.50,IT'S TERRIBLE.
105,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,OUR BAY THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THE FISHING IN
106,00:04:58.46,00:04:58.46,IS COMPLETELY WASHED OUT SO WE HAVE...
107,00:05:01.04,00:05:01.04,IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE LAZING AROUND WAITING FOR FOOD TO COME.
108,00:05:03.12,00:05:03.12,WE HAVE NO FOOD AND NO MEANS OF GETTING IT.
109,00:05:06.21,00:05:06.21,SO WE'RE DOWN TO TWO CUPS OF RICE A DAY
110,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,AND OUR RATIONS IS
111,00:05:10.25,00:05:10.25,PROBABLY GOING TO PUT US DOWN MORE THAN THAT.
112,00:05:12.00,00:05:12.00,"SO, YEAH, WE'RE STARVING AND WE'RE PRETTY SICK ABOUT IT."
113,00:05:15.08,00:05:15.08,>> HE'S JUST DOING...
114,00:05:16.42,00:05:16.42,THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.
115,00:05:17.75,00:05:17.75,"HE WAITS UNTIL THE FISH COMES DOWN, WAITS FOR THEM,"
116,00:05:20.42,00:05:20.42,SNAGS 'EM WHEN HE SEES HIM
117,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,AND THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD BE FISHING RIGHT NOW.
118,00:05:25.12,00:05:25.12,>> WE REALLY NEED TO CATCH SOME FISH TODAY.
119,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,">> YEAH, HE'S DOING IT."
120,00:05:28.29,00:05:28.29,"LOOK, THAT WASN'T HARD."
121,00:05:32.75,00:05:32.75,AND THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SET OUT A NET THERE.
122,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,"OKAY, JANE, I HAVEN'T TRIED THROWING THIS YET."
123,00:05:40.25,00:05:40.25,I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
124,00:05:42.29,00:05:42.29,>> WE CAN TRY TO THROW IT WITH THE TWO OF US.
125,00:05:45.08,00:05:45.08,">> WELL, THERE'S GUYS THAT DO IT IN THE REAL WORLD,"
126,00:05:47.29,00:05:47.29,THROW IT WITH ONE GUY.
127,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,">> I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE."
128,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,>> YEAH.
129,00:05:55.33,00:05:55.33,>> YEAH...
130,00:05:59.21,00:05:59.21,THAT WAS GOING TO WORK IF IT DIDN'T HIT MY FOOT.
131,00:06:04.29,00:06:04.29,"I'LL TRY A COUPLE TIMES, SEE WHAT I CAN DO."
132,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,>> ALL RIGHT.
133,00:06:10.33,00:06:10.33,>> NOTHING.
134,00:06:11.83,00:06:11.83,>> I DO BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF US IS GOING TO MISS JIMMY JOHNSON.
135,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,"I MEAN, I'M GOING TO MISS HIM"
136,00:06:16.25,00:06:16.25,BECAUSE HE WAS AS GOOD A FISHERMAN AS ANYBODY.
137,00:06:18.71,00:06:18.71,BUT EVERY TEAM I'VE EVER BEEN ON HAD A CAPTAIN AND A CO-CAPTAIN
138,00:06:21.96,00:06:21.96,AND THEY MADE DECISIONS BASED UPON THE ABILITY OF THE TRIBE.
139,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,AND I'M HOPING SOMEBODY'S GOING TO STEP UP
140,00:06:29.50,00:06:29.50,"AND SAY ""I WANT THAT ROLE."""
141,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT RAINED LAST NIGHT
142,00:06:50.08,00:06:50.08,UNTIL I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I TRIED TO CLIMB OUT
143,00:06:52.21,00:06:52.21,OF THE SHELTER AND IT WAS A LITTLE WET.
144,00:06:53.42,00:06:53.42,I SLEPT THAT WELL.

153,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,>> MAYBE IT'S TREE-MAIL.
154,00:07:23.33,00:07:23.33,"SO, UM, REMEMBER HOW THE CLUE SHOWS THE TREE"
155,00:07:27.33,00:07:27.33,AND THE GUY NEXT TO THE TREE?

157,00:07:29.42,00:07:29.42,SO IT'S WEST.
158,00:07:30.42,00:07:30.42,>> YOU ARE GOOD!
159,00:07:31.92,00:07:31.92,>> SO MAYBE LIKE ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE TREE AND THE SUN
160,00:07:34.42,00:07:34.42,SO THAT YOU'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU DIG.
161,00:07:40.25,00:07:40.25,DIG EIGHT YARDS WEST OF TREE-MAIL.
162,00:07:43.92,00:07:43.92,>> WEST IS THAT WAY SO IT'S LIKE IN THE BUSHES.
163,00:07:46.21,00:07:46.21,">> LOOK, WEST..."
164,00:07:59.62,00:07:59.62,">> LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND."

168,00:08:08.21,00:08:08.21,>> GET IT! GET IT!
169,00:08:10.12,00:08:10.12,"OH, MY GOD!"
170,00:08:11.50,00:08:11.50,>> WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT?
171,00:08:12.50,00:08:12.50,">> OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!"
172,00:08:16.29,00:08:16.29,IT'S THE KEY TO OUR LIFE IN THE GAME.
173,00:08:18.96,00:08:18.96,"THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS MINE, MINE,"
174,00:08:21.29,00:08:21.29,IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ANYONE ELSE.

176,00:08:25.12,00:08:25.12,BUT ULTIMATELY I FIGURED IT OUT AND IT'S MINE.
177,00:08:29.21,00:08:29.21,>> THAT WAS CRAZY.
178,00:08:30.54,00:08:30.54,>> THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IS IN MY SOCK.
179,00:08:32.21,00:08:32.21,IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

186,00:08:45.25,00:08:45.25,>> AND THAT WOULD NOT LET ANYONE STAND IN MY WAY.
187,00:08:48.12,00:08:48.12,NOT EVEN A ONE-LEGGED PERSON CAN STAND IN MY WAY AS YOU CAN SEE.
188,00:08:51.29,00:08:51.29,ONE SHOVE SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

585,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,TO HELP THIS TEAM WIN.
586,00:23:24.67,00:23:24.67,I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST
587,00:23:26.88,00:23:26.88,AND I CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE.
588,00:23:28.46,00:23:28.46,I JUST WANT A FAIR OPPORTUNITY.
589,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,DOESN'T EVEN GET AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?
590,00:23:32.83,00:23:32.83,">> JIMMY T., HE'S DIGGING HIS OWN HOLE."
591,00:23:36.96,00:23:36.96,EVERY TIME WE HAVE A CHALLENGE HE'S VERY NEGATIVE AFTERWARDS.
592,00:23:39.67,00:23:39.67,"VERY NEGATIVE HE SAYS ""ALL I WANT IS A SHOT."
593,00:23:42.38,00:23:42.38,"""I CAN GET IN THERE,"
594,00:23:44.00,00:23:44.00,"I CAN MAKE SOME THINGS, I'VE COACHED."""
595,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,"YOU KNOW, START GIVING ME HIS RESUME."
596,00:23:46.54,00:23:46.54,BOTTOM LINE IS HE'S VERY MUCH ABOUT HIM
597,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,AND IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE CLEAR
598,00:23:50.62,00:23:50.62,AND THE COMMENTS TODAY I DIDN'T DIG AT ALL.
599,00:24:01.38,00:24:01.38,>> WHAT!

611,00:24:22.54,00:24:22.54,(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
612,00:24:25.12,00:24:25.12,"A TARP, BABY!"
613,00:24:26.88,00:24:26.88,WHOO!
614,00:24:28.00,00:24:28.00,>> WE CAN SLEEP NOW.
615,00:24:30.71,00:24:30.71,>> AS SOON AS I OPENED THE TACKLE BOX
616,00:24:32.29,00:24:32.29,I SAW A ROLLED UP PIECE OF PAPER.
617,00:24:34.12,00:24:34.12,I KNEW IT WAS A CLUE AND AS SOON AS I SAW THAT I SHUT IT.
618,00:24:37.79,00:24:37.79,>> LET'S HAVE A LITTLE WATERMELON CELEBRATION.
619,00:24:39.29,00:24:39.29,EVERYONE ELSE WENT OVER AND LOOKED AT THE TARP
620,00:24:41.54,00:24:41.54,"OR WHATEVER THEY WERE LOOKING AT, I DIDN'T CARE."
621,00:24:43.38,00:24:43.38,"I GRABBED THE NOTE,"
622,00:24:46.58,00:24:46.58,"FOLDED IT UP, PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND..."
623,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,BRENDA IS A VERY CLOSE ALLY OF MINE.
624,00:24:52.92,00:24:52.92,I'D PROBABLY TRUST HER MORE THAN ANYONE OUT HERE.
625,00:24:55.25,00:24:55.25,I HAVE A CLUE IN MY POCKET.
626,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,>> WHAT?
627,00:25:00.08,00:25:00.08,>> YEP.
628,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,"I'M TELLING YOU THAT BECAUSE I TRUST YOU, YOU KNOW?"
629,00:25:03.75,00:25:03.75,">> I KNOW, I KNOW."
630,00:25:04.92,00:25:04.92,SO NOW WHAT?
631,00:25:07.54,00:25:07.54,>> NOW WE LOOK FOR IT.
632,00:25:11.17,00:25:11.17,DIG EIGHT YARDS LEFT OF TREE-MAIL.
633,00:25:15.33,00:25:15.33,>> LET'S GO.
634,00:25:16.54,00:25:16.54,>> LET'S GO.

636,00:25:22.88,00:25:22.88,>> CHASE FOUND THE THIRD CLUE.
637,00:25:25.25,00:25:25.25,HE FIGURED OUT WHERE IT SHOULD BE IF IT WAS THERE
638,00:25:29.21,00:25:29.21,AND I JUST FELT SO BAD BECAUSE HE IS MY BUDDY.
639,00:25:32.12,00:25:32.12,DO YOU TRUST NAY?
640,00:25:35.29,00:25:35.29,>> DO YOU TRUST HER?
641,00:25:36.67,00:25:36.67,>> I TRUST HER.
642,00:25:38.38,00:25:38.38,>> YOU DO?

651,00:25:55.17,00:25:55.17,>> WHAT?
652,00:25:56.67,00:25:56.67,IT'S EITHER EIGHT YARDS THAT WAY OR EIGHT YARDS WEST.
653,00:26:01.46,00:26:01.46,DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE CLUE?
654,00:26:09.33,00:26:09.33,">> OKAY, THIS IS THE THING."
655,00:26:10.83,00:26:10.83,YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
656,00:26:12.04,00:26:12.04,>> GO AHEAD.

658,00:26:14.67,00:26:14.67,SO IF NAY FOR WHATEVER REASON CONFIDED IN ME
659,00:26:17.54,00:26:17.54,BECAUSE SHE REALLY DOES TRUST ME AND I TRUST HER.
660,00:26:19.25,00:26:19.25,>> WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?
661,00:26:21.38,00:26:21.38,>> BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO KEEP MY TRUST
662,00:26:26.29,00:26:26.29,WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
663,00:26:27.83,00:26:27.83,>> SOMEONE HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL?
664,00:26:29.79,00:26:29.79,WHO? NAY?
665,00:26:31.08,00:26:31.08,>> YEAH.

668,00:26:34.54,00:26:34.54,>> I SWEAR TO YOU.
669,00:26:35.54,00:26:35.54,>> YOU GUYS FOUND IT?
670,00:26:36.54,00:26:36.54,>> I SWEAR TO YOU WE FOUND IT.
671,00:26:37.71,00:26:37.71,>> YOU CAN NOT TRUST ANYONE IN THIS GAME
672,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO.
673,00:26:41.62,00:26:41.62,NAONKA AND I DON'T HAVE A GREAT TRUST
674,00:26:44.08,00:26:44.08,"BUT WE DO HAVE BRENDA BETWEEN US, YOU KNOW?"
675,00:26:45.79,00:26:45.79,SO AS LONG AS NAY'S
676,00:26:48.12,00:26:48.12,"NOT COMING AFTER ME, THEN THAT'S FINE."
677,00:26:50.62,00:26:50.62,CAN I DO THIS?
678,00:26:51.62,00:26:51.62,>> WHAT?

682,00:26:56.25,00:26:56.25,YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
683,00:26:57.92,00:26:57.92,"IF WORD GETS OUT THAT I TOLD CHASE,"
684,00:26:59.54,00:26:59.54,NAY WON'T TRUST ME ANYMORE BECAUSE I...
685,00:27:01.29,00:27:01.29,I BETRAYED HER TRUST.
686,00:27:03.12,00:27:03.12,WHICH IS BIG BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE IDOL.
687,00:27:05.50,00:27:05.50,YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MY POSITION.
688,00:27:06.88,00:27:06.88,SHE HAS IT.
689,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,"SO IF I BETRAY HER, WE'RE ALL--"
690,00:27:10.75,00:27:10.75,"ME, YOU-- ARE ALL SCREWED UP."
691,00:27:24.42,00:27:24.42,>> NOT A LOT OF SEA URCHINS HERE.
692,00:27:26.04,00:27:26.04,">> THAT'S A BIG ONE, ISN'T IT?"
693,00:27:28.38,00:27:28.38,>> YEAH GOOD ENOUGH.
694,00:27:29.50,00:27:29.50,YOU CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT.
695,00:27:31.21,00:27:31.21,">> OH, WE'RE DIGGING AROUND FOR SEA URCHINS."
696,00:27:33.58,00:27:33.58,WE'RE REALLY HURTING FOR FOOD
697,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,AND THIS IS ABOUT IT.
698,00:27:37.42,00:27:37.42,YOU GET TINY LITTLE GLOP OF SALTY PROTEIN.
699,00:27:41.12,00:27:41.12,BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD.
700,00:27:42.67,00:27:42.67,THEY ACTUALLY ARE JUST A BIT OF FLAVOR
701,00:27:45.92,00:27:45.92,"AND YEAH, WE'RE DOWN TO SEA URCHINS NOW."
702,00:27:55.08,00:27:55.08,">> MARTY, YOU'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPANY POT?"
703,00:27:58.12,00:27:58.12,>> I JUST GRABBED TWO OR THREE OF THE LITTLE TINY ONES.
704,00:28:00.38,00:28:00.38,">> TWO OR THREE OVER HERE,"
705,00:28:02.25,00:28:02.25,TWO OR THREE OVER THERE THEN TWO OR THREE OVER THERE.
706,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE TEAM?
707,00:28:05.88,00:28:05.88,"COME ON, MAN, BE A TRIBE PLAYER."
708,00:28:07.38,00:28:07.38,">> NOT GONNA GO THERE WITH YOU, BUDDY."
709,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,YOU GUYS CAN EAT ALL THE ONES YOU CAUGHT.
710,00:28:10.83,00:28:10.83,>> ALL RIGHT.
711,00:28:12.08,00:28:12.08,JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
712,00:28:14.38,00:28:14.38,>> APPRECIATE THAT.
713,00:28:19.62,00:28:19.62,TRYING TO CALL ME OUT AS A NON-TEAM PLAYER
714,00:28:22.12,00:28:22.12,BECAUSE I ATE A COUPLE SEA URCHINS
715,00:28:23.92,00:28:23.92,"AND I DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE SEA URCHINS TO HIS NET,"
716,00:28:26.25,00:28:26.25,HE JUST DOESN'T GET THIS GAME.
717,00:28:28.21,00:28:28.21,"YOU DO THAT,"
718,00:28:29.92,00:28:29.92,THAT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO ENSURE YOUR DESTINY IN THIS GAME.
719,00:28:41.21,00:28:41.21,">> OH, BACK THERE HE WAS LIKE..."
720,00:28:42.17,00:28:42.17,">> OH, WITH THE..."
721,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,>> YOU EATING THE URCHINS ALL BY YOURSELF.
722,00:28:45.08,00:28:45.08,I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER.
723,00:28:46.62,00:28:46.62,GIVE ME A BREAK.
724,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,">> YOU ARE. DON'T WORRY, YOU ARE."
725,00:28:49.38,00:28:49.38,>> OF COURSE I KNOW THAT.
726,00:28:51.00,00:28:51.00,SO JIMMY T. TRYING TO TELL ME
727,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,THAT I'M NOT A TEAM PLAYER
728,00:28:54.96,00:28:54.96,AND CALLING IT OUT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TRIBE?
729,00:28:57.17,00:28:57.17,"THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING A GUN TO YOUR MOUTH,"
730,00:28:59.75,00:28:59.75,PULLING THE TRIGGER AND BLOWING YOUR BRAINS OUT
731,00:29:01.38,00:29:01.38,AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
732,00:29:14.25,00:29:14.25,>> I'M GOING TO WRITE DANNY'S NAME DOWN.
733,00:29:16.58,00:29:16.58,I DON'T WANT TO BUT I'M GOING TO.
734,00:29:18.21,00:29:18.21,I THINK HE'S BEEN HITTING AROUND.
735,00:29:20.50,00:29:20.50,HE'S HAD ENOUGH.
736,00:29:21.79,00:29:21.79,DON'T YOU?
737,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,I'M GOING TO HATE LOSING DANNY
738,00:29:25.42,00:29:25.42,BECAUSE I LOVE HIS LITTLE ONE-LINERS.
739,00:29:26.79,00:29:26.79,>> SO DO I.
740,00:29:27.96,00:29:27.96,">> I MEAN, I DO."
741,00:29:29.12,00:29:29.12,>> SO YOU THINK THAT'S WHO YOU'LL VOTE FOR?
742,00:29:30.79,00:29:30.79,>> YEAH.
743,00:29:32.08,00:29:32.08,BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COACH PUT DOWN
744,00:29:34.12,00:29:34.12,AND I THINK COACH WAS SENDING A MESSAGE TO US
745,00:29:36.58,00:29:36.58,TO VOTE THE NEXT WEAKEST LINK OUT.
746,00:29:43.46,00:29:43.46,>> HONESTLY I THINK WE'LL KEEP DAN AROUND AFTER TODAY.
747,00:29:45.25,00:29:45.25,HE ALWAYS SITS OUT.
748,00:29:46.62,00:29:46.62,>> WE HAVE TO.
749,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,WE HAVE TO.
750,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,IT'S CRITICAL.
751,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,HE'S OUR SWING VOTE.
752,00:29:51.92,00:29:51.92,>> I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT 28 MORE DAYS OF THIS IN ME.
753,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,>> JUST TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME.
754,00:29:55.96,00:29:55.96,TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME.
755,00:30:00.25,00:30:00.25,"BUT JIMMY T. FOR SURE, RIGHT?"
756,00:30:02.67,00:30:02.67,CORRECT?
757,00:30:04.25,00:30:04.25,>> WHATEVER YOU SAY.
758,00:30:05.38,00:30:05.38,">> WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON TYRONE, OKAY?"
759,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,"THAT'S THE KEY, RIGHT?"
760,00:30:08.04,00:30:08.04,>> I'LL TALK TO HIM.
761,00:30:09.08,00:30:09.08,>> THE MAIN THING IS THAT DANNY DOES NOT GO HOME.
762,00:30:11.00,00:30:11.00,I TRIED TO DRILL THAT INTO JILL.
763,00:30:12.58,00:30:12.58,I THINK SHE GETS IT.
764,00:30:13.75,00:30:13.75,DO I WISH DANNY WAS STRONGER AND BETTER?
765,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,IT WOULD BE GREAT BUT AFTER TONIGHT
766,00:30:18.54,00:30:18.54,PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T MATTER
767,00:30:20.21,00:30:20.21,WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT WHETHER DANNY'S WEAK
768,00:30:21.79,00:30:21.79,AND WHY AM I PROTECTING HIM.
769,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,>> STUFF'S TOO WET.
770,00:30:24.08,00:30:24.08,>> IT WILL BE NUMBERS.
771,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
772,00:30:26.33,00:30:26.33,AND THE NUMBERS WILL DICTATE THE OUTCOME
773,00:30:28.67,00:30:28.67,OF THE NEXT THREE TRIBALS AND I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON HIM.
774,00:30:30.96,00:30:30.96,I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON HIM.
775,00:30:32.25,00:30:32.25,">> HEY, LOOK AT THIS."
776,00:30:34.08,00:30:34.08,>> WOULD YOU STOP?
777,00:30:35.12,00:30:35.12,>> CAN YOU HELP ME UNTIE THE SHOES?
778,00:30:36.46,00:30:36.46,>> JIMMY T. DRIVES US ALL CRAZY.
779,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,HE DRIVES EVERYBODY CRAZY IN CAMP.
780,00:30:41.00,00:30:41.00,IT'S JUST... IT'S ANNOYING AS ALL HELL
781,00:30:43.21,00:30:43.21,AND IF I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM
782,00:30:45.04,00:30:45.04,"AT ANY MORE TRIBAL COUNCILS, IT WILL BE A BLESSING."
783,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,>> I DON'T KNOW.
784,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,IT'S A TOSSUP BETWEEN DANNY AND JIMMY T.
785,00:30:52.12,00:30:52.12,>> IF I'D GIVE YOU MY DRUTHERS I'D PICK JIMMY T.
786,00:30:54.83,00:30:54.83,">> OKAY, GIVEN MY DRUTHERS I'D PICK DAN"
787,00:30:58.83,00:30:58.83,BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS...
788,00:31:00.08,00:31:00.08,EVERYTHING REQUIRES SOMETHING.
789,00:31:01.71,00:31:01.71,DAN'S HAVING A HARD TIME WALKING.
790,00:31:03.00,00:31:03.00,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
791,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,I HELP HIM THROUGH EVERYTHING.
792,00:31:05.12,00:31:05.12,"YEAH, HE'S A GREAT GUY"
793,00:31:06.58,00:31:06.58,AND HE'S STILL GOING TO BE A GREAT GUY BUT YOU'RE NOT...
794,00:31:09.17,00:31:09.17,"YOU KNOW, HELPING OUR CAUSE RIGHT NOW."
795,00:31:10.75,00:31:10.75,>> RIGHT.
796,00:31:11.96,00:31:11.96,">> HONESTLY, I WANT DAN TO GO BUT HE'S..."
797,00:31:13.79,00:31:13.79,BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOR A STRONG TEAM
798,00:31:16.33,00:31:16.33,BUT HE'S INTRINSIC TO MY ALLIANCE
799,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,SO I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.
800,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,"I MEAN, I LOVE DAN BUT HE'S DEFINITELY THE GUY"
801,00:31:22.58,00:31:22.58,WHO SITS EVERY GAME SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
802,00:31:25.04,00:31:25.04,>> DID HE SAY ANYTHING?
803,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,>> HE WANTS DAN.
804,00:31:27.25,00:31:27.25,>> HE WANTS WHAT?
805,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,>> DAN. HE THINKS DAN'S WEAK.
806,00:31:29.38,00:31:29.38,HE'S ALL ABOUT A STRONG TEAM.
807,00:31:30.96,00:31:30.96,I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN SWING HIM SO I DON'T KNOW.
808,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,>> I DON'T WANT TO VOTE DANNY OUT.
809,00:31:35.50,00:31:35.50,I'M TELLING YOU.
810,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,ARE YOU LEANING TOWARDS ONE OR THE OTHER RIGHT NOW?
811,00:31:45.92,00:31:45.92,>> YEAH.
812,00:31:47.58,00:31:47.58,IT'S KIND OF CRAZY.
813,00:31:48.96,00:31:48.96,I DON'T KNOW.
814,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,I GUESS DANNY WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT.
815,00:31:52.08,00:31:52.08,"HIS KNEES, HE CAN'T RUN IN THE MUD."
816,00:31:53.88,00:31:53.88,EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN
817,00:31:55.12,00:31:55.12,"IN THE MUD TO SOME DEGREE, YOU KNOW?"
818,00:31:56.71,00:31:56.71,">> A LITTLE BIT, YEAH, I HEAR YOU."
819,00:31:58.29,00:31:58.29,I JUST THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S THINGS
820,00:32:02.12,00:32:02.12,"THAT ARE JUST WRONG, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
821,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,IT'S LIKE A CANCER.
822,00:32:05.54,00:32:05.54,"TO BE HONEST, RIGHT NOW I'D RATHER HAVE JIMMY T. GONE."
823,00:32:08.50,00:32:08.50,AND I FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY ABOUT HAVING SOMEBODY
824,00:32:11.67,00:32:11.67,THAT'S THAT VOLATILE AND THAT LOOSE.
825,00:32:13.92,00:32:13.92,AND IT'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF MY PATIENCE
826,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,"BUT, UM, YEAH, HIS PLEA,"
827,00:32:19.79,00:32:19.79,HIS BIGGEST FEEDBACK AFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY
828,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,"WAS THAT HE WANTS TO BE THE LEADER,"
829,00:32:23.25,00:32:23.25,"BASICALLY, IS WHAT HE'S SAYING."
830,00:32:24.71,00:32:24.71,THE GUY'S A TRAIN WRECK.
831,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,I CAN'T BELIEVE HE COULD LEAD ANYTHING.
832,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,>> YEAH.
833,00:32:29.12,00:32:29.12,>> ALL I WANT IS A SHOT AT ONE CHALLENGE.
834,00:32:31.46,00:32:31.46,ONE SHOT; ONE CHALLENGE.
835,00:32:33.38,00:32:33.38,THAT'S ALL.
836,00:32:35.29,00:32:35.29,I DON'T WANT TO BE LEADER.
837,00:32:36.50,00:32:36.50,>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?
838,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,>> I'M NOT SAYING I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT
839,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,OR I COULD HAVE WON TODAY.
840,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,I JUST WOULD HAVE LIKED THE OPPORTUNITY.
841,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,THE QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T I GETTING THE CHANCE?
842,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,"WHY IS EVERYBODY SAYING HEY, LET ME GET A CHANCE."
843,00:32:48.12,00:32:48.12,"NO, NO, NO."
844,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,WHY IS THAT?
845,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,">> YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES SILENCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL"
846,00:32:53.50,00:32:53.50,"THAN SPEAKING AND IT'S A SOCIAL GAME, TOO,"
847,00:32:56.46,00:32:56.46,AND I KNOW J.T. APPEARS VERBALLY
848,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,TO BE SECURE BUT HE'S INSECURE.
849,00:33:01.25,00:33:01.25,>> I'VE GOT TO BE ME.
850,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,"I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY ""PLEASE CAN I HAVE MY CHANCE?"""
851,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,>> AND WHEN SOMEONE OF THAT STATURE
852,00:33:08.21,00:33:08.21,"AND THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT DOESN'T TRUST HE'S ENOUGH,"
853,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,IS HE...
854,00:33:12.67,00:33:12.67,I CAN'T TRUST HE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH DOWN THE ROAD.
855,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,">> ANYWAY, THANKS FOR LISTENING."
856,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,I...
857,00:33:17.83,00:33:17.83,SEND ME YOUR THERAPY BILL
858,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,AND I APPRECIATE YOU HEARING ME.
859,00:33:21.12,00:33:21.12,>> I'M A MOTHER
860,00:33:22.71,00:33:22.71,AND I DON'T CODDLE MY KIDS THAT MUCH.
861,00:33:28.71,00:33:28.71,>> YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME.
862,00:33:30.50,00:33:30.50,I'M SCARED IT MIGHT BE ME BECAUSE I KEEP OPENING MY MOUTH.
863,00:33:33.29,00:33:33.29,I'M GETTING A LITTLE MESSY.
864,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,"CAN YOU PASS ME THE NAPKINS, PLEASE?"
865,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,BUT OF COURSE EVERY TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH
866,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,"ABOUT ""PUT ME IN, COACH"" IT FALLS ON DEAF EARS."
867,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,THEY DON'T TALK MUCH TO ME.
868,00:33:42.29,00:33:42.29,I GET VERY LITTLE OUT OF THEM.
869,00:33:43.92,00:33:43.92,THAT'S WHAT FEEDS MY FUEL
870,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,OF FEELING LIKE I'M ALL ALONE ON A PLANET HERE.
871,00:33:49.21,00:33:49.21,IT'S A TOUGH GROUP OF PEOPLE TO GET ALONG WITH.
872,00:33:51.88,00:33:51.88,"AND I'M EASY TO GET ALONG WITH, I THINK."
873,00:34:14.08,00:34:14.08,">> Jeff: TYRONE, LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE."
874,00:34:15.88,00:34:15.88,WHAT HAPPENED?
875,00:34:17.04,00:34:17.04,>> TODAY WE WENT WITH OUR PLAN.
876,00:34:19.29,00:34:19.29,WORKED OUT WELL.
877,00:34:21.12,00:34:21.12,I THINK THE MEDALLION OF POWER...
878,00:34:22.54,00:34:22.54,>> Jeff: WAIT.
879,00:34:23.79,00:34:23.79,YOUR PLAN FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE WORKED OUT WELL?
880,00:34:26.21,00:34:26.21,">> WELL, PROVIDED THE MEDALLION OF POWER WASN'T IN THE PLAY"
881,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE.
882,00:34:31.54,00:34:31.54,">> Jeff: MARTY, IS THAT YOUR TAKE AS WELL?"
883,00:34:33.75,00:34:33.75,">> YEAH, WE HAD ONE MORE ITEM TO GO,"
884,00:34:35.54,00:34:35.54,THEY HAD TWO TO START OUT WITH SO AT THE VERY LEAST
885,00:34:38.25,00:34:38.25,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CLOSE MATCH OR WE COULD HAVE HAD A LEG UP.
886,00:34:40.46,00:34:40.46,">> Jeff: TO BE CLEAR, YOU HAD ONE MORE ITEM,"
887,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,"A SET OF KEYS, A CHEST,"
888,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,THREE LOCKS AND GETTING IT BACK.
889,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
890,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,IT'S BEHIND US; WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD.
891,00:34:48.58,00:34:48.58,"FIXING WHAT WE CAN AT CAMP,"
892,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,THAT'S THE MENTAL ATTITUDE YOU HAVE TO HAVE.
893,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,">> Jeff: DAN, YOU SAT OUT OF THE CHALLENGE YET AGAIN."
894,00:34:54.62,00:34:54.62,>> I TOLD EVERYBODY ON THE TRIBE
895,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,THAT I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
896,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,BECAUSE OF MY KNEE SLOSHING AROUND IN MUD.
897,00:35:01.75,00:35:01.75,"IF YOU PUT ME ON LEVEL GROUND, I'LL GO UP AGAINST ANYBODY."
898,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
899,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,THAT I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD AT AND POSSIBLY HURT THE TRIBE?
900,00:35:10.12,00:35:10.12,">> Jeff: NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER."
901,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,BUT WHEN YOU COME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL SAYING
902,00:35:14.21,00:35:14.21,"""I CAN'T GO BECAUSE IT'S MUDDY"""
903,00:35:16.08,00:35:16.08,"WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RAIN FOREST,"
904,00:35:17.58,00:35:17.58,YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE WORRIED
905,00:35:19.58,00:35:19.58,THAT MAYBE I'M JUST TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN.
906,00:35:21.67,00:35:21.67,>> ABSOLUTELY.
907,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,"YEAH, MAYBE I AM."
908,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,>> Jeff: DO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE?
909,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,>> NO.
910,00:35:27.29,00:35:27.29,"IF I THINK I'M MAKING THE PROPER CHOICE OF SITTING DOWN,"
911,00:35:29.71,00:35:29.71,THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.
912,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,I DON'T WANT TO HURT THE TRIBE.
913,00:35:33.71,00:35:33.71,">> Jeff: JILL, HOW MUCH DOES THAT FACTOR IN FOR YOU"
914,00:35:37.67,00:35:37.67,WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHO TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT?
915,00:35:39.88,00:35:39.88,>> IT'S...
916,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,IT FACTORS IN A LOT IN MY THINKING.
917,00:35:42.88,00:35:42.88,"I MEAN, I KNOW EVERYONE'S KIND OF LIKE,"
918,00:35:44.67,00:35:44.67,"RAH, RAH, WE DID OUR BEST, BUT I'M TIRED OF LOSING."
919,00:35:47.08,00:35:47.08,I'M NOT USED TO LOSING.
920,00:35:48.29,00:35:48.29,I DON'T LIKE IT.
921,00:35:49.25,00:35:49.25,WE'VE GONE THROUGH AN N.F.L. COACH
922,00:35:50.58,00:35:50.58,AND ALL THIS STUFF
923,00:35:52.21,00:35:52.21,AND WE'RE STILL NOT WINNING CHALLENGES
924,00:35:53.75,00:35:53.75,AND IT'S BUGGING ME.
925,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,">> Jeff: JIMMY T., JILL MENTIONS"
926,00:35:57.12,00:35:57.12,"YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH AN N.F.L. COACH, GOT RID OF HIM."
927,00:35:59.33,00:35:59.33,HOW FRUSTRATING IS THAT TO NOT HAVE LEADERSHIP?
928,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,>> RIGHT.
929,00:36:03.29,00:36:03.29,THE SHIP IS GOING DOWN.
930,00:36:04.50,00:36:04.50,"WE KEEP COMING BACK HERE VOTING GUYS OUT,"
931,00:36:06.67,00:36:06.67,SO WHY DON'T WE TRY MIXING IT UP?
932,00:36:08.29,00:36:08.29,">> Jeff: AND ""MIXING IT UP"" WOULD MEAN WHAT?"
933,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,>> EVERYBODY KNOWS I'VE BEEN VOCAL
934,00:36:12.17,00:36:12.17,IN WANTING ONE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE TRIBE
935,00:36:15.46,00:36:15.46,"IN AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,"
936,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,BUT I CONTINUE TO BE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL
937,00:36:19.67,00:36:19.67,THAT DOESN'T GET THE OIL.
938,00:36:20.88,00:36:20.88,">> Jeff: MARTY, WHY NOT GIVE JIMMY T. A SHOT?"
939,00:36:22.62,00:36:22.62,ARE YOU OPEN TO IT?
940,00:36:23.75,00:36:23.75,">> NOT NECESSARILY, NO."
941,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,"I MEAN, I THINK AS A TRIBE,"
942,00:36:28.08,00:36:28.08,WE THOUGHT THAT TYRONE SHOULD BE THE GUY CALLING THE SHOTS.
943,00:36:30.62,00:36:30.62,I DON'T THINK IT'S ALWAYS NECESSARILY
944,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,SOME INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP QUALITY.
945,00:36:34.17,00:36:34.17,"I MEAN, WE HAD JIMMY JOHNSON FOR... SAKE."
946,00:36:36.29,00:36:36.29,IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT
947,00:36:38.08,00:36:38.08,WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.
948,00:36:39.46,00:36:39.46,YOU'VE GOT A STRESSFUL SITUATION HERE.
949,00:36:42.46,00:36:42.46,"THERE IS ZERO TOLERANCE FOR PARANOIA,"
950,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,"DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR,"
951,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,POPPING OFF.
952,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,"EVERYONE RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO BE AS PATIENT AS POSSIBLE,"
953,00:36:53.29,00:36:53.29,BUT IT'S BEEN STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT.
954,00:36:55.29,00:36:55.29,">> JEFF, I'M OFFERING."
955,00:36:56.75,00:36:56.75,"THEY DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT, THAT'S FINE."
956,00:36:59.29,00:36:59.29,BUT WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS IS ESPADA TRIBE HAVING RIGHT NOW?
957,00:37:01.71,00:37:01.71,>> Jeff: VERY LITTLE.
958,00:37:03.08,00:37:03.08,>> CASE CLOSED.
959,00:37:04.62,00:37:04.62,">> YOU KNOW, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?"
960,00:37:06.08,00:37:06.08,ALL HE'S ASKING FOR IS A CHANCE.
961,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,LET HIM TRY.
962,00:37:09.88,00:37:09.88,HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE SIXTH PERSON ON THE BENCH
963,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY AS THE FIRST PERSON ON THE BENCH
964,00:37:13.96,00:37:13.96,IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE?
965,00:37:15.54,00:37:15.54,THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.
966,00:37:17.25,00:37:17.25,">> LISTEN, I'M A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE TRIBE."
967,00:37:20.08,00:37:20.08,I PROVIDE FOOD.
968,00:37:21.54,00:37:21.54,"I TRY TO PROVIDE COMFORT,"
969,00:37:23.67,00:37:23.67,BUT EVIDENTLY THEY DON'T SEE ME THE SAME LIGHT I SEE ME.
970,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,">> Jeff: TYRONE, IF YOU BELIEVED JIMMY T. COULD CHANGE,"
971,00:37:30.88,00:37:30.88,"IF YOU BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE,"
972,00:37:32.92,00:37:32.92,WOULD HE HAVE VALUE TO THE TRIBE?
973,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,>> YEAH. HE HAS VALUE NOW
974,00:37:36.46,00:37:36.46,AS IT IS EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT A FOLLOWER.
975,00:37:38.21,00:37:38.21,"HE WOULD HAVE MORE VALUE IF HE WAS,"
976,00:37:40.79,00:37:40.79,"YOU KNOW, ABLE TO BE A FOLLOWER."
977,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,">> Jeff: OKAY. SO JIMMY T.,"
978,00:37:44.50,00:37:44.50,ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ROLE
