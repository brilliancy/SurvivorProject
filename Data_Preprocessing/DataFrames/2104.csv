786,00:30:58.83,00:30:58.83,BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS...
787,00:31:00.08,00:31:00.08,EVERYTHING REQUIRES SOMETHING.
788,00:31:01.71,00:31:01.71,DAN'S HAVING A HARD TIMEWALKING.
789,00:31:03.00,00:31:03.00,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
790,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,I HELP HIM THROUGH EVERYTHING.
791,00:31:05.12,00:31:05.12,"YEAH, HE'S A GREAT GUY"

796,00:31:13.79,00:31:13.79,BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEENFOR A STRONG TEAM
797,00:31:16.33,00:31:16.33,BUT HE'S INTRINSICTO MY ALLIANCE
798,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,SO I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.
799,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,"I MEAN, I LOVE DAN BUT HE'SDEFINITELY THE GUY"
800,00:31:22.58,00:31:22.58,WHO SITS EVERY GAMESO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
801,00:31:25.04,00:31:25.04,>> DID HE SAY ANYTHING?
802,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,>> HE WANTS DAN.
803,00:31:27.25,00:31:27.25,>> HE WANTS WHAT?
804,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,>> DAN. HE THINKS DAN'S WEAK.
805,00:31:29.38,00:31:29.38,HE'S ALL ABOUT A STRONG TEAM.
806,00:31:30.96,00:31:30.96,I DON'T KNOW THAT I CANSWING HIM SO I DON'T KNOW.

810,00:31:45.92,00:31:45.92,>> YEAH.
811,00:31:47.58,00:31:47.58,IT'S KIND OF CRAZY.
812,00:31:48.96,00:31:48.96,I DON'T KNOW.
813,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,I GUESS DANNYWAS MY FIRST THOUGHT.
814,00:31:52.08,00:31:52.08,"HIS KNEES,HE CAN'T RUN IN THE MUD."
815,00:31:53.88,00:31:53.88,EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN
816,00:31:55.12,00:31:55.12,"IN THE MUD TO SOME DEGREE,YOU KNOW?"
817,00:31:56.71,00:31:56.71,">> A LITTLE BIT,YEAH, I HEAR YOU."
818,00:31:58.29,00:31:58.29,I JUST THINK SOMETIMESTHERE'S THINGS
819,00:32:02.12,00:32:02.12,"THAT ARE JUST WRONG,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
820,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,IT'S LIKE A CANCER.
821,00:32:05.54,00:32:05.54,"TO BE HONEST, RIGHT NOWI'D RATHER HAVE JIMMY T. GONE."
822,00:32:08.50,00:32:08.50,AND I FEEL PRETTY STRONGLYABOUT HAVING SOMEBODY
823,00:32:11.67,00:32:11.67,THAT'S THAT VOLATILEAND THAT LOOSE.
824,00:32:13.92,00:32:13.92,AND IT'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIESOF MY PATIENCE
825,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,"BUT, UM, YEAH, HIS PLEA,"
826,00:32:19.79,00:32:19.79,HIS BIGGEST FEEDBACKAFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY
827,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,"WAS THAT HE WANTSTO BE THE LEADER,"
828,00:32:23.25,00:32:23.25,"BASICALLY, IS WHAT HE'S SAYING."
829,00:32:24.71,00:32:24.71,THE GUY'S A TRAIN WRECK.
830,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,I CAN'T BELIEVEHE COULD LEAD ANYTHING.
831,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,>> YEAH.

835,00:32:35.29,00:32:35.29,I DON'T WANT TO BE LEADER.
836,00:32:36.50,00:32:36.50,>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVEDONE DIFFERENTLY?
837,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,>> I'M NOT SAYING I WOULD HAVEDONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT
838,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,OR I COULD HAVE WON TODAY.
839,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,I JUST WOULD HAVE LIKEDTHE OPPORTUNITY.
840,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,THE QUESTION ISWHY AREN'T I GETTING THE CHANCE?
841,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,"WHY IS EVERYBODY SAYING HEY,LET ME GET A CHANCE."
842,00:32:48.12,00:32:48.12,"NO, NO, NO."
843,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,WHY IS THAT?
844,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,">> YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES SILENCEIS A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL"
845,00:32:53.50,00:32:53.50,"THAN SPEAKINGAND IT'S A SOCIAL GAME, TOO,"
846,00:32:56.46,00:32:56.46,AND I KNOW J.T. APPEARS VERBALLY
847,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,TO BE SECURE BUT HE'S INSECURE.
848,00:33:01.25,00:33:01.25,>> I'VE GOT TO BE ME.
849,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,"I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY""PLEASE CAN I HAVE MY CHANCE?"""
850,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,>> AND WHEN SOMEONEOF THAT STATURE
851,00:33:08.21,00:33:08.21,"AND THAT ACCOMPLISHMENTDOESN'T TRUST HE'S ENOUGH,"
852,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,IS HE...
853,00:33:12.67,00:33:12.67,I CAN'T TRUST HE'S GOINGTO BE ENOUGH DOWN THE ROAD.
854,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,">> ANYWAY, THANKS FOR LISTENING."
855,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,I...

860,00:33:28.71,00:33:28.71,>> YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME.
861,00:33:30.50,00:33:30.50,I'M SCARED IT MIGHT BE MEBECAUSE I KEEP OPENING MY MOUTH.
862,00:33:33.29,00:33:33.29,I'M GETTING A LITTLE MESSY.
863,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,"CAN YOU PASS ME THE NAPKINS,PLEASE?"
864,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,BUT OF COURSE EVERY TIMEI OPEN MY MOUTH
865,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,"ABOUT ""PUT ME IN, COACH""IT FALLS ON DEAF EARS."
866,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,THEY DON'T TALK MUCH TO ME.
867,00:33:42.29,00:33:42.29,I GET VERY LITTLE OUT OF THEM.
868,00:33:43.92,00:33:43.92,THAT'S WHAT FEEDS MY FUEL
869,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,OF FEELING LIKE I'M ALL ALONEON A PLANET HERE.
870,00:33:49.21,00:33:49.21,IT'S A TOUGH GROUP OF PEOPLETO GET ALONG WITH.
871,00:33:51.88,00:33:51.88,"AND I'M EASY TO GET ALONG WITH,I THINK."
872,00:34:14.08,00:34:14.08,">> Jeff: TYRONE, LET'S TALKABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE."

880,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUCH MORE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE.
881,00:34:31.54,00:34:31.54,">> Jeff: MARTY, IS THATYOUR TAKE AS WELL?"
882,00:34:33.75,00:34:33.75,">> YEAH, WE HAD ONE MORE ITEMTO GO,"

884,00:34:38.25,00:34:38.25,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CLOSE MATCHOR WE COULD HAVE HAD A LEG UP.
885,00:34:40.46,00:34:40.46,">> Jeff: TO BE CLEAR,YOU HAD ONE MORE ITEM,"
886,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,"A SET OF KEYS, A CHEST,"
887,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,THREE LOCKS AND GETTING IT BACK.
888,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
889,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,IT'S BEHIND US;WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD.
890,00:34:48.58,00:34:48.58,"FIXING WHAT WE CAN AT CAMP,"
891,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,THAT'S THE MENTAL ATTITUDEYOU HAVE TO HAVE.
892,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,">> Jeff: DAN, YOU SATOUT OF THE CHALLENGE YET AGAIN."
893,00:34:54.62,00:34:54.62,>> I TOLD EVERYBODY ON THE TRIBE
894,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,THAT I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
895,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,BECAUSE OF MY KNEE SLOSHINGAROUND IN MUD.
896,00:35:01.75,00:35:01.75,"IF YOU PUT ME ON LEVEL GROUND,I'LL GO UP AGAINST ANYBODY."
897,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,BUT WHY WOULD I WANTTO DO SOMETHING
898,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,THAT I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD ATAND POSSIBLY HURT THE TRIBE?
899,00:35:10.12,00:35:10.12,">> Jeff: NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER."

905,00:35:21.67,00:35:21.67,>> ABSOLUTELY.
906,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,"YEAH, MAYBE I AM."

910,00:35:29.71,00:35:29.71,THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DOAND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.
911,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,I DON'T WANT TO HURT THE TRIBE.

927,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,>> RIGHT.
928,00:36:03.29,00:36:03.29,THE SHIP IS GOING DOWN.
