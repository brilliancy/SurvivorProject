84,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,inside of it in a big circle.And then you pull it out
85,00:06:01.17,00:06:01.17,really fast and at least acouple of them are still in

566,00:33:52.79,00:33:52.79,Then we'll go Margaret.Then we'll go Judd.
567,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,"That gets them into the merger,because they can pick us off one"
568,00:33:57.88,00:33:57.88,by one and they can use yourstrength.
569,00:33:59.88,00:33:59.88,"Because you're still not votedoff, but you're always in the"

575,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,">> My biggest concern right now,of course, is Jamie and"
576,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,Stephenie not being as loyalas they say they are.
577,00:35:13.50,00:35:13.50,That leaves me vulnerable.Now they've got four against my

579,00:35:18.79,00:35:18.79,"scary.>> It's freakin' hot, man."

601,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,except on one occasion.Judd was with Stephenie and
602,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,Jamie.And they were... connected
