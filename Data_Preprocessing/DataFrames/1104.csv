15,00:00:39.12,00:00:39.12,">> If you're going to slant it, you got to decide which way you"
16,00:00:41.58,00:00:41.58,want to slant it. >> PROBST: And Bobby Jon and
17,00:00:43.79,00:00:43.79,Judd got annoyed. >> I'm 28 years old.
18,00:00:45.92,00:00:45.92,You just can't tell grown men what to do all the time.

26,00:01:05.08,00:01:05.08,Temperature update: 114 degrees. Yaxha struggled when Amy
27,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,sprained her ankle and Brianna and Lydia couldn't pull it
28,00:01:14.25,00:01:14.25,together. >> Why don't you move it!

42,00:03:27.25,00:03:27.25,>> Being here is the hottest conditions I've ever been in in
43,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,my life. Hotter than I could possibly
44,00:03:32.29,00:03:32.29,"imagine. I mean, we're talking triple"
45,00:03:35.17,00:03:35.17,"digits every day, and it seems like every day it goes up a"
46,00:03:37.54,00:03:37.54,"couple of digits more. Just when you think like 104,"
47,00:03:41.17,00:03:41.17,"holy crap, that is the hottest I could possibly imagine,"
48,00:03:43.58,00:03:43.58,"the next day it's 114. >> I tell you, you take the heat"
49,00:03:51.88,00:03:51.88,"and you get near a fire, it's even worse."
50,00:03:54.04,00:03:54.04,>> Uh-huh. >> The tribe's pretty tired.
51,00:04:00.08,00:04:00.08,We're weak after yesterday's challenge.
52,00:04:02.58,00:04:02.58,It was like nothing we had ever dreamed of.
53,00:04:06.88,00:04:06.88,Heat absolutely wiped us out. It's brutal.
54,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,And you can't do anything. You're sapped of energy.
55,00:04:13.88,00:04:13.88,And the mosquitoes are unbelievable.
56,00:04:21.33,00:04:21.33,>> I've never seen anything like the bugs in my life.
57,00:04:24.71,00:04:24.71,In my entire... you know what?
58,00:04:26.33,00:04:26.33,"They just, it's like you ever watch The Killer Bees, the"
59,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,movie? They're all over you.
60,00:04:32.25,00:04:32.25,"I mean, they're literally, if I didn't have my sweatshirt on,"
61,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,forget about it. >> We were smacking and kind of
62,00:04:38.21,00:04:38.21,"fight sparring in the wind, man, just trying to get the"
63,00:04:41.12,00:04:41.12,"mosquitoes out of there, but it ain't gonna work, man."
64,00:04:44.00,00:04:44.00,It only works for about maybe a millimeter of a second.
65,00:04:47.08,00:04:47.08,Then the thing goes and he's right back at you.
66,00:04:51.21,00:04:51.21,">> I know, man, we have a bunch of bites."
67,00:04:52.96,00:04:52.96,">> They're brutal today. >> Yeah, this, this place"
68,00:04:59.88,00:04:59.88,"changes you out here. I mean, between starving and the"
69,00:05:03.83,00:05:03.83,"heat and mosquitoes and bugs, everything adds up, and it just,"
70,00:05:07.42,00:05:07.42,"you know, completely wears you down."
71,00:05:10.62,00:05:10.62,So I find it's just easier to lay around and do nothing.
72,00:05:15.38,00:05:15.38,"I guess, which is kind of pathetic, but, I don't know,"
73,00:05:19.08,00:05:19.08,"we're still on top, you know. We're beating the other team."
74,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,"I mean, I can't imagine how the other team feels if we're not"
75,00:05:25.25,00:05:25.25,"feeling very well. I mean, God knows what it's like"
76,00:05:27.92,00:05:27.92,"around their place. >> Now, that's the method we"
77,00:05:34.50,00:05:34.50,need to start using. >> Oops.
78,00:05:37.25,00:05:37.25,">> It's going down. >> Quick, quick, quick."
79,00:05:38.79,00:05:38.79,>> I got him. >> There we go.
80,00:05:41.21,00:05:41.21,>> How many you have total? >> Four so far.
81,00:05:44.33,00:05:44.33,>> Whoa! >> There's the ticket right
82,00:05:47.88,00:05:47.88,there. >> So the method for today was
83,00:05:52.17,00:05:52.17,sit this big pot down in the water that had all the cornmeal
84,00:05:54.96,00:05:54.96,in it. And then all the minnows swarm
85,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,inside of it in a big circle. And then you pull it out
86,00:06:01.17,00:06:01.17,really fast and at least a couple of them are still in
87,00:06:03.62,00:06:03.62,"there. >> I saw it, I saw it."
88,00:06:05.38,00:06:05.38,There he is. They hide in the bottom.
89,00:06:09.17,00:06:09.17,">> Basically, we're a finally tuned fishing machine."
90,00:06:11.29,00:06:11.29,"Gary and I, there's no stopping us."
91,00:06:14.46,00:06:14.46,"These minnows are in trouble. >> Oh, my God!"
92,00:06:24.08,00:06:24.08,">> Looks like a croc, if you ask me."
93,00:06:26.54,00:06:26.54,>> I'd say you're right. >> I think it probably is.
94,00:06:28.04,00:06:28.04,>> Wow! >> We were all down
95,00:06:31.67,00:06:31.67,"at the dock, and we look out into the flat lake, and all of a"
96,00:06:36.46,00:06:36.46,"sudden, we see this huge croc, and he seemed pretty long."
97,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50,>> He's coming this way. >> Oh.
98,00:06:42.54,00:06:42.54,">> Oh, my God! It's the Loch Ness Monster."
99,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83,(gasps) >> Wow!
100,00:06:52.46,00:06:52.46,>> He went and suddenly he caught a fish and we saw that
101,00:06:54.79,00:06:54.79,"big mouth eat it. We were like, uh-oh, that could"
102,00:06:58.79,00:06:58.79,have been one of us if we were swimming across its path.
103,00:07:14.21,00:07:14.21,>> Ow! >> What?
104,00:07:16.29,00:07:16.29,">> A fish got me. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
105,00:07:39.71,00:07:39.71,Nakum getting your first look at the new Yaxha tribe.
106,00:07:45.08,00:07:45.08,Brianna voted out at the last Tribal Council.
107,00:07:48.08,00:07:48.08,"Take a seat on the bench. Well, it's day nine and you guys"
108,00:07:52.12,00:07:52.12,have endured arguably the toughest Survivor ever.
109,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,So you've earned a little relief.
110,00:07:58.21,00:07:58.21,"Today we're going to give you a break from the challenges, and"
111,00:08:01.04,00:08:01.04,instead give you a chance to learn a little bit about what
112,00:08:04.75,00:08:04.75,your tribe mates think about you.
113,00:08:07.08,00:08:07.08,"At the same time, you'll gain a little insight into the other"
114,00:08:09.54,00:08:09.54,tribe. I'm going to ask you a series of
115,00:08:11.50,00:08:11.50,questions about your tribe mates.
116,00:08:13.88,00:08:13.88,"You'll write your answers down, reveal them to me."
117,00:08:16.54,00:08:16.54,Keep in mind each answer will have a direct effect on those
118,00:08:20.67,00:08:20.67,tribe mates. Make sense?
119,00:08:23.50,00:08:23.50,Let's get started. First question: which tribe
120,00:08:26.88,00:08:26.88,member is most in need of some nourishment?
121,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"You cannot vote for yourself. I know everybody's hungry, but"
122,00:08:34.12,00:08:34.12,which tribe member in particular most needs some nourishment?
123,00:08:38.12,00:08:38.12,"All right, reveal. Yaxha is almost a slam dunk for"
124,00:08:43.29,00:08:43.29,Jamie as most in need of some nourishment.
125,00:08:46.62,00:08:46.62,"For Nakum, everybody voting for Danni."
126,00:08:49.54,00:08:49.54,"Danni, Jamie, come on up. >> Oh."
127,00:08:55.25,00:08:55.25,(all sigh) >> PROBST: They're yours.
128,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,Dig in. Take a bite.
129,00:09:01.12,00:09:01.12,>> Whoo-hoo! >> PROBST: It's not a race.
130,00:09:04.96,00:09:04.96,It's yours. >> Mmm.
131,00:09:06.71,00:09:06.71,">> Go ahead, Jamie. You deserve it."
132,00:09:09.46,00:09:09.46,>> PROBST: All right. Next question: which tribe
133,00:09:11.79,00:09:11.79,member is the smelliest? Who smells the worst on your
134,00:09:16.92,00:09:16.92,tribe? That's got to be a tough one.
135,00:09:19.33,00:09:19.33,"Margaret says, nope, easy. Let's reveal."
136,00:09:22.88,00:09:22.88,"For Yaxha, we have three Jamies and four Garys."
137,00:09:28.04,00:09:28.04,All right. Gary gets designated the
138,00:09:30.71,00:09:30.71,"smelliest. And for Nakum, we have four"
139,00:09:33.42,00:09:33.42,Bobby Jons. That's enough.
140,00:09:35.54,00:09:35.54,"Bobby Jon and Gary, come forward."
141,00:09:38.38,00:09:38.38,">> Go get it, Gar. >> PROBST: What I have for you"

144,00:09:53.21,00:09:53.21,">> Nice backbones there, guys. >> PROBST: Gary not wasting any"
145,00:09:59.04,00:09:59.04,"water. >> There's shampoo there, Bobby"
146,00:10:01.21,00:10:01.21,Jon. >> Use all that soap.
147,00:10:02.75,00:10:02.75,">> Don't romance it, sweetheart. >> Oh, he's scrubbing."
148,00:10:05.62,00:10:05.62,"Look at the lather. >> Oh, man."
149,00:10:07.96,00:10:07.96,">> Use all that soap. >> PROBST: Margaret, you got"
150,00:10:10.54,00:10:10.54,"shower envy. >> Oh, my God, I do."
151,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,">> Gary, we're going to be smelling you all night, just"
152,00:10:15.67,00:10:15.67,sniffing. >> PROBST: I can't say you look
153,00:10:18.92,00:10:18.92,"a lot different. >> Thanks, guys."
154,00:10:20.71,00:10:20.71,"Yo, baby-- mmm! >> PROBST: Next question: from"
155,00:10:28.04,00:10:28.04,"your tribe, which man and which woman most deserves a picnic"
156,00:10:33.62,00:10:33.62,"afternoon atop an ancient Maya pyramid, returning to their camp"
157,00:10:38.92,00:10:38.92,later this afternoon? Put down one woman and one man.
158,00:10:43.46,00:10:43.46,"Reveal. For Yaxha, it looks like it is"
159,00:10:48.25,00:10:48.25,Gary. The man.
160,00:10:50.33,00:10:50.33,"And we have Amy, the woman. For Nakum, we have Margaret."
161,00:10:55.92,00:10:55.92,"For the men, it looks like it is Judd."

163,00:11:01.29,00:11:01.29,"on up. Amy, you look like you're going"
164,00:11:04.83,00:11:04.83,"to cry. >> What is it, a tarantula?"
165,00:11:07.25,00:11:07.25,>> PROBST: I wouldn't do that to you.
166,00:11:11.21,00:11:11.21,">> Oh, my God! (cheering, sobbing)"

170,00:11:28.12,00:11:28.12,Eat it all. You can't bring it back.
171,00:11:30.42,00:11:30.42,"There's no burden on you. >> Guys, man, I love you,"

173,00:11:36.75,00:11:36.75,"people remaining, which tribe member has the most tribe pride?"
174,00:11:42.75,00:11:42.75,Who just bleeds Yaxha blue? Who bleeds Nakum yellow?
175,00:11:47.62,00:11:47.62,"Who has the most tribe pride? Okay, reveal."
176,00:11:53.17,00:11:53.17,"Yaxha, it is three votes Brian, two votes Steph."
177,00:11:57.04,00:11:57.04,Brian noted as tribe member with the most tribe pride.
178,00:12:00.92,00:12:00.92,"For Nakum, Cindy has four votes. Cindy noted as having the most"
179,00:12:06.04,00:12:06.04,"tribe pride. So, Brian, you have the most"
180,00:12:08.92,00:12:08.92,tribe pride for Yaxha. It's only fitting you remain a
181,00:12:11.79,00:12:11.79,"Yaxha member. >> Oh, my God."
182,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33,>> PROBST: Take a spot on the Yaxha mat.
183,00:12:17.54,00:12:17.54,">> Oh, no. >> PROBST: Jamie, Rafe, Lydia"
184,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,"and Steph, drop your buffs. You are now members of Nakum."
185,00:12:26.04,00:12:26.04,"You're switching tribes. Come on up, get a buff, have a"
186,00:12:29.33,00:12:29.33,"spot on the Nakum mat. Cindy, meet your new tribe"
187,00:12:34.67,00:12:34.67,"members. >> Hey, Cindy."
188,00:12:38.08,00:12:38.08,">> PROBST: Now Nakum, because you have one extra member, one"
189,00:12:40.54,00:12:40.54,of you will remain a Nakum member.

191,00:12:46.88,00:12:46.88,There are five buffs here. One of them is Nakum yellow.
192,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,You're going to draw to decide your fate.
193,00:12:52.71,00:12:52.71,You decide who draws and what order.
194,00:12:54.42,00:12:54.42,It's up to you. Danni fields blue.
195,00:13:01.42,00:13:01.42,You're now a member of Yaxha. Who's next?
196,00:13:04.42,00:13:04.42,"Brooke, choose your fate. You stay with Nakum."
197,00:13:11.12,00:13:11.12,"That settles the rest of it. Bobby Jon, Blake, Brandon,"
198,00:13:15.38,00:13:15.38,you're all now members of Yaxha. Gary and Amy will be returning
199,00:13:19.25,00:13:19.25,to the Yaxha camp later for a bit of a surprise.
200,00:13:22.83,00:13:22.83,"Nakum, Judd and Margaret will be returning to your tribe, also in"
201,00:13:26.62,00:13:26.62,for a bit of a surprise. Head on back to camp.
202,00:13:30.00,00:13:30.00,"Get to know each other. >> Wow, man!"
203,00:13:47.62,00:13:47.62,Top of the world. >> How about a toast?
204,00:13:51.21,00:13:51.21,"Guys, to Guatemala. >> Yes."
205,00:13:53.25,00:13:53.25,(indistinct chatter) >> The location of this
206,00:13:57.50,00:13:57.50,picnic was great. We were above this whole area
207,00:14:00.08,00:14:00.08,"here. We could see everything, the"
208,00:14:01.79,00:14:01.79,"whole lake. You could see, I'm going to"
209,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,"guess, 30 miles. >> Oh, my God!"
210,00:14:07.46,00:14:07.46,"It's so good. Oh, wow!"
211,00:14:10.25,00:14:10.25,">> Where are you from, Amy?"
212,00:14:12.08,00:14:12.08,>> Boston. >> Are you?
213,00:14:14.21,00:14:14.21,We were trying to guess your accent.
214,00:14:16.21,00:14:16.21,It was either New York or Boston.
215,00:14:18.04,00:14:18.04,>> Boston. >> That's what we were figuring
216,00:14:19.58,00:14:19.58,out. And we think you're a
217,00:14:21.08,00:14:21.08,policewoman. And you're an ex-football
218,00:14:22.75,00:14:22.75,"player? >> No, I'm a landscaper."
219,00:14:25.04,00:14:25.04,>> Are you really? >> Did Danni say something about
220,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,being a football player? >> She said you looked familiar.
221,00:14:31.79,00:14:31.79,>> I wish I was. >> Margaret was asking Gary
222,00:14:34.21,00:14:34.21,"a question about pro football. Who knows, watch him be retired"
223,00:14:37.83,00:14:37.83,and he's like a multimillionaire.
224,00:14:39.92,00:14:39.92,I'll kill him. I'll freaking kill him.
225,00:14:43.54,00:14:43.54,">> Oh, that was good. I needed that, man."
226,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,">> I feel so guilty, though. >> We just got back from"
227,00:14:57.71,00:14:57.71,"the reward challenge, which wasn't so much challenge as it"
228,00:15:01.21,00:15:01.21,was swap up the tribes. There's our flag right up there.
229,00:15:05.88,00:15:05.88,">> Hey, we have fruit. Lookit!"
230,00:15:08.71,00:15:08.71,Yeah! Welcome.
231,00:15:11.17,00:15:11.17,"Welcome, Danni. (indistinct chatter)"
232,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,">> Welcome, man. Nice to have you guys."
233,00:15:20.00,00:15:20.00,"You guys are tough. >> So I was getting the feel,"
234,00:15:22.21,00:15:22.21,"you know, who they were, showing them around the new"
235,00:15:24.29,00:15:24.29,"tribe, playing host, and being like I'm so glad I have you"
236,00:15:26.29,00:15:26.29,guys. This is great.
237,00:15:28.96,00:15:28.96,"Guys who are new to Yaxha, I'm with you guys."
238,00:15:31.12,00:15:31.12,We're awesome. We're going to win.
239,00:15:33.58,00:15:33.58,>> You like mad dog? >> I haven't been tired yet.
240,00:15:35.04,00:15:35.04,A lot of other people in my tribe have felt tired.
241,00:15:37.33,00:15:37.33,">> Don't overwork yourself, though, dude."
242,00:15:40.17,00:15:40.17,We need to save ourselves for those challenges.
243,00:15:41.71,00:15:41.71,">> No, you're right. That's why you guys are winning."
244,00:15:43.33,00:15:43.33,>> The thing that sucks is that there are four Nakum on our new
245,00:15:45.88,00:15:45.88,"tribe and three Yaxha. If it's a numbers game, they"
246,00:15:49.21,00:15:49.21,could easily pick us off one by one.
247,00:15:51.42,00:15:51.42,"So I was like, Oh, my God, what am I doing with four new people?"
248,00:15:56.29,00:15:56.29,"Is that Amy down there? Amy, Gary, welcome back, guys."
249,00:16:01.75,00:16:01.75,There's water over here with the rest of our team.
250,00:16:05.08,00:16:05.08,>> What? >> Here's Johnny.
251,00:16:08.25,00:16:08.25,">> Hey, hey. What's going on?"
252,00:16:10.79,00:16:10.79,>> Get the ... out of here. What the ... is going on?
253,00:16:15.33,00:16:15.33,Is this a joke? >> We're Yaxha.
254,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,"Thanks for having me. >> Hey, what's up?"
255,00:16:19.54,00:16:19.54,>> They switched us up. >> I was like completely
256,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,"blown away. Hey, what's up, guys?"
257,00:16:27.88,00:16:27.88,"Hey, nice to meet you. I'm looking at Gary."
258,00:16:31.00,00:16:31.00,"I'm, like, we're decimated here, decimated!"
259,00:16:35.50,00:16:35.50,Gone! >> Commercial real estate.
260,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,Farmer. Waiter.
261,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,What do you do? >> No football?
262,00:16:43.29,00:16:43.29,>> Landscaper. Who did you think I was?
263,00:16:46.00,00:16:46.00,">> Oh, I thought you played for Central Michigan."
264,00:16:48.08,00:16:48.08,">> I went to Central Michigan, but I didn't play there."
265,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,>> No? Oh. >> I thought Gary was gonna die
266,00:16:55.50,00:16:55.50,"when he looked at me, because I called him out right away"
267,00:16:57.92,00:16:57.92,"on the whole quarterback thing. I don't know, maybe he just"
268,00:17:01.04,00:17:01.04,doesn't want anybody to know he was a former professional
269,00:17:03.42,00:17:03.42,"quarterback because, you know, you think right away, he doesn't"
270,00:17:06.04,00:17:06.04,need the money. >> Where you from?
271,00:17:09.04,00:17:09.04,>> Kansas. >> I'm totally gonna deny
272,00:17:12.92,00:17:12.92,that I'm Gary Hoogebum until the end.
273,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,"I'm not going to blow my strategy, and that's my cover."
274,00:17:20.67,00:17:20.67,So I'm keeping it. >> How are you all doing?
275,00:17:29.67,00:17:29.67,">> Hi, guys. >> What are you guys doing over"
276,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,here? >> There's been a little team
277,00:17:34.08,00:17:34.08,"mix-up. >> No way, no way."
278,00:17:38.12,00:17:38.12,No way. >> Yeah.
279,00:17:41.71,00:17:41.71,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my gosh."
280,00:17:47.62,00:17:47.62,">> Oh, yeah. >> I thought you guys"
281,00:17:49.21,00:17:49.21,were just sitting here for a picnic.
282,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,>> You came over and I was like why is she so surprised.
283,00:17:54.38,00:17:54.38,">> I'm like, we have company. (indistinct conversations)"
284,00:17:59.88,00:17:59.88,">> It's all we can do, man. You know what I'm saying?"
285,00:18:02.83,00:18:02.83,">> They have more men. >> With this switch-up today, I"
286,00:18:06.08,00:18:06.08,don't feel safe at all. Not at all.
287,00:18:11.79,00:18:11.79,">> Damn, this is the first time it rained."
288,00:18:16.46,00:18:16.46,">> My head and my stomach are so mixed up right now,"
289,00:18:20.33,00:18:20.33,"with everything that's happened today, I'm trying"
290,00:18:24.83,00:18:24.83,"frantically to scramble in my head to see, you know, what"
291,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"we're going to do. I think the old Nakum tribe,"
292,00:18:34.46,00:18:34.46,"myself, Cindy, Brooke, and Judd, is going to stick together with"
293,00:18:39.62,00:18:39.62,the old Nakum tribe. But who knows what Yaxha can do?
294,00:18:43.08,00:18:43.08,"It's still four against four. So, food is in our belly."
295,00:18:47.58,00:18:47.58,"There's been a major turnover, and game is on."
296,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,(thunder rumbling) >> I thought they were
297,00:18:55.04,00:18:55.04,"just visiting. >> I was just like,"
298,00:18:57.08,00:18:57.08,"whatever, man. I don't give a crap."
299,00:18:58.96,00:18:58.96,">> I know I was shocked, but my stomach is like..."
300,00:19:02.08,00:19:02.08,">> But honestly, when I first saw these people back at camp,"
301,00:19:04.46,00:19:04.46,"I was like, ah, whatever. Who cares?"
302,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,"Tribes have been switched, man. It's great, I love it, man."
303,00:19:11.96,00:19:11.96,It didn't bother me at the least bit.
304,00:19:14.04,00:19:14.04,"I know it bothered Margaret, and Margaret's still walking on"
305,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,"eggshells, man. I'm just glad that I'm not"
306,00:19:22.08,00:19:22.08,"involved with all those other guys, man."
307,00:19:24.17,00:19:24.17,"I mean, we had Bobby Jon. We had Blake."
308,00:19:26.75,00:19:26.75,"We had Brandon and me, which was kind of, you know, a male"
309,00:19:31.71,00:19:31.71,"testosterone thing. Now over here, man, I know I'm"
310,00:19:34.58,00:19:34.58,"the big gun around here, man. I know it."
311,00:19:36.62,00:19:36.62,"You feel like you're King Kong, man."
312,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,"Ah, feeling good, baby. (roaring)"
313,00:19:52.79,00:19:52.79,>> What's her name? What's that girl...?
314,00:19:55.71,00:19:55.71,">> Brooke. She's cool and everything, but"
315,00:19:58.58,00:19:58.58,she's not an athlete. Want to get rid of her?
316,00:20:02.46,00:20:02.46,>> We could try to start with her if we had to.
317,00:20:05.83,00:20:05.83,"They're down in numbers. If we can keep us four tight,"
318,00:20:09.21,00:20:09.21,we really need to. >> I bet Brooke is better than
319,00:20:12.17,00:20:12.17,Lydia is at stuff. >> I know.
320,00:20:15.71,00:20:15.71,"But as soon as we get rid of Lydia, if we have to, they could"
321,00:20:19.46,00:20:19.46,get rid of us one by one. >> I know.
322,00:20:21.88,00:20:21.88,>> We're going to push for Brooke so we can keep the old
323,00:20:24.38,00:20:24.38,"Yaxha together, just in case, just to always have the numbers"
324,00:20:27.96,00:20:27.96,and keep Lydia around just because she is a hard worker.
325,00:20:30.38,00:20:30.38,>> Let's just let them approach us.
326,00:20:32.29,00:20:32.29,>> Okay. >> Okay? 'Cause you don't want
327,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,to be too pushy. Because then people back away.
328,00:20:35.96,00:20:35.96,">> Judd told me, he goes, I'm with you, man, he goes, I got"
329,00:20:38.12,00:20:38.12,your back. >> Yeah.
330,00:20:40.21,00:20:40.21,And Judd's from Jersey. We know a lot of the same kind
331,00:20:43.04,00:20:43.04,of things. >> We connect.
332,00:20:45.42,00:20:45.42,"Okay, we'll see what's up. Yeah."
333,00:20:48.04,00:20:48.04,">> Hey, Judd. >> Yeah."
334,00:20:52.29,00:20:52.29,">> Jimmy, the first guy that went out, threw out his"
335,00:20:55.54,00:20:55.54,bicep? He never got to come up here.
336,00:20:58.42,00:20:58.42,">> Oh, really? >> Yeah, he couldn't make it up"
337,00:21:01.38,00:21:01.38,here. >> Who's the strongest girl?
338,00:21:03.75,00:21:03.75,"Margaret, right? >> Yeah, she's strong."
339,00:21:07.00,00:21:07.00,Cindy's tough. >> The two weakest we see is
340,00:21:11.04,00:21:11.04,Brooke and Lydia. >> Who's your strongest?
341,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,">> Who are you like tighter with, Cindy or Margaret?"
342,00:21:15.29,00:21:15.29,"Like, if we were to like... >> It's hard to say, you know, I"
343,00:21:19.00,00:21:19.00,"can see you guys, I'm kind of more personable already with you"
344,00:21:23.42,00:21:23.42,than I am with any of the girls that I was on my team with.
345,00:21:28.12,00:21:28.12,I don't know. >> Right.
346,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,>> It just didn't kind of click. >> You know when you have like a
347,00:21:32.25,00:21:32.25,"natural click. >> Yeah, you can feel it."
348,00:21:33.75,00:21:33.75,You can see it. It's all just natural.
349,00:21:35.50,00:21:35.50,>> That's what I was saying to Jamie.
350,00:21:37.04,00:21:37.04,I'm obviously sticking with you. Got to stick with the strongest.
351,00:21:40.08,00:21:40.08,">> I mean, I'm-- like I said, man, I'm all with you guys, man."
352,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,"If it goes this way, we get rid of, uh, we get rid of..."
353,00:21:47.88,00:21:47.88,>> We get rid of Brooke and we get Lydia.
354,00:21:50.96,00:21:50.96,Then we can get rid of Margaret or Cindy.
355,00:21:53.04,00:21:53.04,Then we've got Rafe. Rafe will vote whatever we say
356,00:21:54.79,00:21:54.79,"to vote. >> Yeah, Rafe will do"
357,00:21:56.75,00:21:56.75,whatever we do. >> Yeah.
358,00:21:58.17,00:21:58.17,">> So it's kind of hard, though, because we're still in"
359,00:22:00.21,00:22:00.21,that newlywed type phase. We're like...
360,00:22:03.54,00:22:03.54,>> Still learning. >> You don't go a day without
361,00:22:05.79,00:22:05.79,"talking. >> I'm all for that, man."
362,00:22:07.92,00:22:07.92,"Like I said, I'm basically, now, this is the game."
363,00:22:10.88,00:22:10.88,The game's started. >> Yeah.
364,00:22:13.12,00:22:13.12,">> Here I come, you know? I mean, I like where I'm sitting"
365,00:22:16.25,00:22:16.25,"right now. I feel-- feel very good, man."
366,00:22:19.46,00:22:19.46,Me and Stephenie and Jamie hit it off already.
367,00:22:21.46,00:22:21.46,I think we got a little alliance going.
368,00:22:23.50,00:22:23.50,We're not eating the peel right now.
369,00:22:25.50,00:22:25.50,">> Yeah, I am. >> Oh, you eat the peel?"
370,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,"I have no problem talking to my old tribe, man."
371,00:22:30.92,00:22:30.92,"I really don't, because I didn't feel the love, man."
372,00:22:32.46,00:22:32.46,I didn't feel the love there at all.
373,00:22:34.42,00:22:34.42,"I felt no love there. So they got to go, man."
374,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,"They got to get out of my jungle, man."

398,00:24:24.25,00:24:24.25,I want them to think I can walk. I just think I'm a major target
399,00:24:27.08,00:24:27.08,right now. There's no doubt in my mind.

518,00:31:10.00,00:31:10.00,"could get a leg up. Hopefully, it will be Judd."
519,00:31:13.17,00:31:13.17,We need Judd to feel comfortable with us.

523,00:31:28.79,00:31:28.79,">> So what we're thinking is, I think it would be wise to keep"
524,00:31:33.50,00:31:33.50,the majority. At the same time I feel bad for
525,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,Lydia puts her heart and soul into it.
526,00:31:38.25,00:31:38.25,">> But that's all of us, all of us are going home."

529,00:31:44.12,00:31:44.12,>> We just had an immunity challenge that was a really
530,00:31:46.54,00:31:46.54,close call and unfortunately we lost it.
531,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,And everyone at camp seems to be under the impression we just got
532,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,to vote the weakest person off. >> What are you telling Judd?
533,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,>> That we want Lydia? >> That we're voting for Lydia.
534,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"That's what we're doing. >> First, Brooke and Cindy and I"
535,00:32:04.17,00:32:04.17,are going to stick together. We have to decide where Judd
536,00:32:08.75,00:32:08.75,"stands-- how much, you know, loyalty he has to the old Nakum"
537,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,tribe. >> So what's the word down by
538,00:32:19.08,00:32:19.08,the dock? What are they talking about?
539,00:32:21.54,00:32:21.54,>> I'm kind of thinking that we have to vote off whoever is the
540,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,weakest. You know? I mean it really
541,00:32:26.62,00:32:26.62,"sucks. >> So, give me a name."
542,00:32:29.21,00:32:29.21,Who are they saying? >> We're thinking Lydia.
543,00:32:31.54,00:32:31.54,Does that seem to be what everybody else is?
544,00:32:35.00,00:32:35.00,>> Sounds fine with me. Whatever you all want to do.
545,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,">> You know, I mean, I don't want to, but..."
546,00:32:50.50,00:32:50.50,>> I'd like old Nakum to stick together.
547,00:32:53.25,00:32:53.25,I really would. >> Okay.
548,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,">> But we've got 4-4, right? >> Uh-huh."
549,00:32:58.62,00:32:58.62,">> If they vote one of us, we vote one of them."
550,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,">> I mean, at this point, you basically want to go for the"
551,00:33:06.67,00:33:06.67,"weakest player, I mean, and it's I mean, Lydia and Brooke are"
552,00:33:10.54,00:33:10.54,"like this. I mean, they're both even."
553,00:33:12.79,00:33:12.79,"So, you know, and then what happens is then it goes back and"
554,00:33:17.46,00:33:17.46,"forth. I lose one, we lose one, they"
555,00:33:20.08,00:33:20.08,"lose one, we lose one, they lose one."
556,00:33:23.12,00:33:23.12,>> It won't be that. It's not going to do that.
557,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,Because they're gonna be four. We'll be three.
558,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,They can pick us off one by one because they'll always have
559,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,majority. Whoever comes out with a
560,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,majority tribe tonight will have majority all along.
561,00:33:36.67,00:33:36.67,">> Yeah, but listen, they don't want to lose either, man."
562,00:33:40.08,00:33:40.08,They're gonna need us. They need us bad.
563,00:33:42.21,00:33:42.21,They need me and you. >> Absolutely. But...
564,00:33:44.04,00:33:44.04,>> They're not going to want to get rid of me and you.
565,00:33:45.46,00:33:45.46,">> But they can also-- they can also say, first, we'll start"
566,00:33:49.88,00:33:49.88,with Brooke. Then we'll go Cindy.
567,00:33:52.79,00:33:52.79,Then we'll go Margaret. Then we'll go Judd.
568,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,"That gets them into the merger, because they can pick us off one"
569,00:33:57.88,00:33:57.88,by one and they can use your strength.
570,00:33:59.88,00:33:59.88,"Because you're still not voted off, but you're always in the"
571,00:34:01.88,00:34:01.88,"minority. >> Well, if that's the case, of"
572,00:34:04.08,00:34:04.08,"course. I mean, it's four against one."
573,00:34:07.12,00:34:07.12,">> You're up in the air? >> Just, right now, I'm just"
574,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,"like whoa, you know, but you definitely got my wheels"
575,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,turning. There's no doubt about that.
576,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,">> My biggest concern right now, of course, is Jamie and"
577,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,Stephenie not being as loyal as they say they are.
578,00:35:13.50,00:35:13.50,That leaves me vulnerable. Now they've got four against my
579,00:35:16.46,00:35:16.46,"one here. You know, and that's a little"
580,00:35:18.79,00:35:18.79,"scary. >> It's freakin' hot, man."
581,00:35:27.33,00:35:27.33,">> In this game, you can't trust anybody."
582,00:35:30.75,00:35:30.75,You can't trust anybody. Sometimes you can't sleep at
583,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,"night thinking about it. You know, is it going to come"
584,00:35:35.88,00:35:35.88,"back and hit me in the face? So when I go to Tribal Council,"
585,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,I don't know who I'm going to choose.
586,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,"I mean, I don't know until I get there."
587,00:35:42.96,00:35:42.96,"I mean, that's just the way it is."
588,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,"I mean, I really-- I don't know. >> PROBST: Welcome back to"
589,00:36:12.67,00:36:12.67,"Tribal Council. Steph, this season in challenges"
590,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,"you've participated in, you're now one for seven."
591,00:36:19.46,00:36:19.46,That brings your Survivor total to four out of 21.
592,00:36:24.25,00:36:24.25,"Maybe it's not bad luck following Steph, but maybe Steph"
593,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,is the bad luck. >> I know.
594,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,"I thought that today, too. I was, like, is it me?"
595,00:36:32.12,00:36:32.12,Do I just have this black cloud that follows me around in the
596,00:36:34.92,00:36:34.92,"game of Survivor, wherever I go? You know, I like to think I'm"
597,00:36:38.08,00:36:38.08,"not bad luck, because that would suck."
598,00:36:41.12,00:36:41.12,"But for some reason, I end up on the short side of the stick."
599,00:36:44.33,00:36:44.33,">> PROBST: Margaret, tell me about the new tribe dynamics."
600,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,You guys were divided evenly. Did you sense pairing off or
601,00:36:51.33,00:36:51.33,"""we better stick together""? >> There wasn't much pairing off"
602,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,except on one occasion. Judd was with Stephenie and
603,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,Jamie. And they were... connected
604,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,pretty quickly. >> PROBST: And did you read that
605,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,as something's going on or... >> I hoped he was just
606,00:37:07.92,00:37:07.92,socializing. And I'm still hoping that he's
607,00:37:09.79,00:37:09.79,"just socializing. >> PROBST: Judd, did you know"
608,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,"people were watching you, and were you trying to hide it?"
609,00:37:14.62,00:37:14.62,>> I wasn't hiding nothing. We were just out there taking it
610,00:37:17.08,00:37:17.08,"all in, just hanging out, having a good time, laughing, getting"
611,00:37:19.75,00:37:19.75,to know each other. I mean just met them.
612,00:37:21.96,00:37:21.96,They just came into the tribe. I was just kind of shooting the
613,00:37:24.33,00:37:24.33,"breeze with them. I mean, ""Hey, what's up, man?"
614,00:37:26.58,00:37:26.58,"I'm Judd. How you doing?"""
615,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,">> PROBST: Lydia, you've been to Tribal Council quite a few"
616,00:37:31.04,00:37:31.04,times. >> Three times. Too much.
617,00:37:33.00,00:37:33.00,">> PROBST: You feel a little more confident now, with this"
618,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,"new tribe or just as vulnerable? >> Well, Jeff, I have to say"
619,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"that, you know, I do feel a little bit vulnerable."
620,00:37:40.33,00:37:40.33,It's a new tribe. They don't know me.
621,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,"They don't know my strength yet, you know."
622,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,I just have to put faith in them and see what they think about
623,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,"me. But all in all, you know, I'm"
624,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,"not ready to leave, so... >> PROBST: Brooke, what"
625,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,specifically worries you tonight?
626,00:37:54.71,00:37:54.71,">> I feel like if you have the brute strength, you're safe on"
627,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,"your team, because it's about winning the immunity challenges"
628,00:38:02.25,00:38:02.25,"right now, and so I feel, in some ways, that the women are a"
629,00:38:05.04,00:38:05.04,little bit more vulnerable than the men at this point.
630,00:38:08.00,00:38:08.00,">> PROBST: Judd, in your profession, you deal with all"
631,00:38:10.54,00:38:10.54,different kinds of people every day.
632,00:38:13.67,00:38:13.67,"How important is that in this game, to be able to read people,"
633,00:38:16.08,00:38:16.08,"make a decision, and be right? >> Oh, it's very important."
634,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,"I mean, I know who I connect with right away."
635,00:38:21.75,00:38:21.75,"That's just the way I am. Somebody's looking at me, I can"
636,00:38:24.21,00:38:24.21,"tell right away, wow, man, I got a connection to you, and we"
637,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,definitely have something in common.
638,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,"I mean, you know, it's easy. I can really pick people off"
639,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,like that. >> PROBST: Okay.
640,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,"It is time to vote. Brooke, you're up."
641,00:38:44.62,00:38:44.62,">> Lydia, I think you're one of the hardest workers around camp,"
642,00:38:48.12,00:38:48.12,but I'm just making this vote based on the decision that we
643,00:38:50.79,00:38:50.79,"need to win immunity challenges. >> Brooke, you're an awesome"
644,00:39:03.58,00:39:03.58,"person, but this vote is for strategy tonight."
645,00:39:06.42,00:39:06.42,"If you go, I have a chance to go a lot further."
646,00:39:09.08,00:39:09.08,"I'm sorry. >> Lydia, I have tribe"
647,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,"loyalties. I gave Brooke my word, and I"
648,00:39:21.21,00:39:21.21,won't go back. Good luck.
649,00:39:49.33,00:39:49.33,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
650,00:40:02.71,00:40:02.71,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
651,00:40:04.88,00:40:04.88,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
652,00:40:07.17,00:40:07.17,immediately. I'll read the votes.
653,00:40:11.25,00:40:11.25,"First vote, Lydia. Brooke."
654,00:40:18.04,00:40:18.04,"One vote Brooke, one vote Lydia. Lydia."
655,00:40:24.04,00:40:24.04,"Two votes Lydia, one vote Brooke."
656,00:40:29.12,00:40:29.12,Lydia. That's three votes Lydia.
657,00:40:34.71,00:40:34.71,"Brooke. Two votes Brooke, three votes"
658,00:40:38.08,00:40:38.08,Lydia. Brooke.
659,00:40:42.75,00:40:42.75,"We're tied. Three votes Brooke, three votes"
660,00:40:44.96,00:40:44.96,"Lydia. That's four votes Brooke, three"
661,00:40:51.21,00:40:51.21,"votes Lydia, one vote left. Fourth person voted out of"
662,00:40:57.00,00:40:57.00,"Survivor: Guatemala, Brooke. You need to bring me your torch."
663,00:41:09.21,00:41:09.21,"Brooke, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
664,00:41:21.17,00:41:21.17,Tribal lines and personal loyalties are going to shift
665,00:41:25.17,00:41:25.17,"throughout this game. Just remember, every time you"
666,00:41:28.88,00:41:28.88,"shift, you make it harder to trust."
667,00:41:32.00,00:41:32.00,Grab your torches. Go back to camp.

682,00:42:17.25,00:42:17.25,"to be out here for 11 days, I did so much stuff that I never"
683,00:42:20.33,00:42:20.33,thought I'd be able to do. I think I proved myself going
684,00:42:23.29,00:42:23.29,through the 11-mile jungle trek. But I don't think my new team
685,00:42:26.54,00:42:26.54,members got to see that. So I didn't get a longer chance
686,00:42:28.54,00:42:28.54,out here to prove how strong I am. I want to wish the girls
687,00:42:30.83,00:42:30.83,from my original team good luck. You guys are some of the
688,00:42:33.17,00:42:33.17,strongest women I've ever met.
