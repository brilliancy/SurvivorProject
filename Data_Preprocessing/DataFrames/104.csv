2,00:00:02.07,00:00:02.07,  JEFF PROBST:   16 Americans forced  to abandon ship
3,00:00:05.57,00:00:05.57, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:09.37,00:00:09.37," Marooned for 39 days,  they must work together"
5,00:00:13.30,00:00:13.30,"  to build shelter, find food  and survive the island,"
6,00:00:17.43,00:00:17.43," but ultimately,  it is everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:20.40,00:00:20.40," Every third night, they will     hike deep into the jungle"
8,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67, to take part   in the Tribal Council
9,00:00:26.40,00:00:26.40,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
10,00:00:30.43,00:00:30.43,"  In the end,   only one will remain"
11,00:00:32.67,00:00:32.67,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
12,00:00:39.50,00:00:39.50, Last week on Survivor:
13,00:00:41.67,00:00:41.67,  Conflict within the tribes   continued to emerge.
14,00:00:44.37,00:00:44.37,  You can only take so much preaching.
15,00:00:46.53,00:00:46.53, Dirk's about driving me  wild with that.
16,00:00:48.47,00:00:48.47,"When Christ came, He opened the door to every human being."
17,00:00:51.60,00:00:51.60,   We've all sort of  come to the conclusion
18,00:00:52.87,00:00:52.87, that Rudy really needs    to get out
19,00:00:54.30,00:00:54.30, of here-- he just criticizes   whatever we're doing.
20,00:00:56.60,00:00:56.60,"Come into the kitchen, ""Morning,    Rudy, how are you doing?"""
21,00:00:59.13,00:00:59.13,"""You're wasting  your time out there."""
22,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00, JEFF:   And hunger set in.
23,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,   The oomph is a little gone.
24,00:01:03.83,00:01:03.83,I think that not eating   is a factor.
25,00:01:05.83,00:01:05.83,  ( laughs ):  We want food.
26,00:01:07.63,00:01:07.63, JEFF:   Tagi Tribe gained advantage  by winning a reward challenge.
27,00:01:11.40,00:01:11.40,   I wanted that mask and snorkel from day one
28,00:01:14.70,00:01:14.70, to go get fish.
29,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87,We got fish.
30,00:01:18.30,00:01:18.30,No way. No way!
31,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,( shrieking )
32,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,Watch the spear.
33,00:01:21.87,00:01:21.87, JEFF:    Pagong was forced    to look elsewhere for food.
34,00:01:24.73,00:01:24.73, JENNA:    I'm so ready to eat rat.
35,00:01:26.47,00:01:26.47," I want to gut 'em, bone 'em..."
36,00:01:27.70,00:01:27.70, JOEL: Surf 'n' turf. Minnows and rat.
37,00:01:30.33,00:01:30.33, GREG:    Rats aren't bad.
38,00:01:31.33,00:01:31.33, Rats are rats.
39,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,Questions of edibility only have   to do with your perceptions.
40,00:01:35.53,00:01:35.53,RAMONA: Please pass the rat.
41,00:01:40.83,00:01:40.83," JEFF:  But Pagong rebounded by winning the immunity challenge,"
42,00:01:44.17,00:01:44.17, and Tagi Tribe was sent back to Tribal Council in the middle
43,00:01:47.40,00:01:47.40, of a tropical storm.
44,00:01:49.17,00:01:49.17,STACEY:  I thought Rudy would be
45,00:01:51.03,00:01:51.03,"   the next one off,   but it could be me."
46,00:01:52.80,00:01:52.80," RUDY:  I'm going to vote Stacey out,  'cause I don't like her"
47,00:01:56.23,00:01:56.23,   and I never will.
48,00:01:57.60,00:01:57.60,"JEFF: Stacey. That's four votes, Stacey."
49,00:01:59.40,00:01:59.40,It's time for you to go.
50,00:02:01.90,00:02:01.90, 13 are left.
51,00:02:03.87,00:02:03.87," Who will be voted off    this week,"
52,00:02:05.83,00:02:05.83, and who will continue    to survive?

54,00:03:05.83,00:03:05.83,  ( thunder rumbling )
55,00:03:31.60,00:03:31.60,I'm not a happy camper.
56,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57,"GERVASE:  It's cold, man."
57,00:03:35.20,00:03:35.20," It got cold and rained a lot,"
58,00:03:37.27,00:03:37.27,"  and everybody got, I mean..."
59,00:03:38.97,00:03:38.97,everybody was just wet.
60,00:03:42.70,00:03:42.70,"RAMONA:   It was long, wet and cold."
61,00:03:45.63,00:03:45.63, It was the worst night
62,00:03:49.63,00:03:49.63,I've ever slept.
63,00:03:53.67,00:03:53.67, GREG:    And worse trouble
64,00:03:55.30,00:03:55.30, was the bugs--    the bugs love it.
65,00:03:57.10,00:03:57.10," Once that rain comes,  it's sand flea heaven."
66,00:03:59.73,00:03:59.73,   GRETCHEN:  I have spent six years
67,00:04:02.67,00:04:02.67,  at the Air Force     survival school.
68,00:04:04.97,00:04:04.97,"  You know, we learned how    to make fires and shelters."
69,00:04:08.23,00:04:08.23,   Come on...
70,00:04:09.87,00:04:09.87,"  When we got here,"
71,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17," we argued over   where the shelter should be,"
72,00:04:13.47,00:04:13.47,"   and everything I've always  been taught, you know,"
73,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"  you put it up off the beach,"
74,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77," you get canopy cover,"
75,00:04:19.27,00:04:19.27,"  which is your first layer  of protection,"
76,00:04:21.40,00:04:21.40," but we made this huge shelter,     which was not comfortable"
77,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33, and it's not practical.
78,00:04:25.93,00:04:25.93,"  It's a rain forest,"
79,00:04:27.27,00:04:27.27,"so it was going to pour   one of these times,"
80,00:04:28.97,00:04:28.97," and it poured,  and we got soaking wet,"
81,00:04:30.43,00:04:30.43,"  and I just thought, ""This is ridiculous,"" you know."
82,00:04:32.50,00:04:32.50,"  And also,  the gear is everywhere."
83,00:04:33.87,00:04:33.87, Our rice bucket's down there; the shovel's down there;
84,00:04:35.90,00:04:35.90,"we don't know, you know, where the parangs are in the morning,"
85,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,and... it's got to stop.
86,00:04:41.00,00:04:41.00,"   What's the reason    for that, though?"
87,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,It's not up-tide-- look.
88,00:04:45.07,00:04:45.07,The shovel is over there 'cause we just dug...
89,00:04:46.83,00:04:46.83,"I know, but you're done digging, so the shovel..."
90,00:04:48.73,00:04:48.73,We don't know if it's done yet.
91,00:04:50.83,00:04:50.83,   GRETCHEN:  I think I am a little    frustrated with Joel today
92,00:04:52.70,00:04:52.70,"  because Joel wants   to take over,"
93,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,"and that's fine,  but Joel doesn't know about..."
94,00:04:56.23,00:04:56.23,"where we're going to be  the most comfortable,"
95,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57,"   and so, you know,   after last night, I thought,"
96,00:05:00.77,00:05:00.77,"""Well, I just can't let   this go on anymore."""
97,00:05:02.83,00:05:02.83," You want to vote me off, fine,   but we got to organize this."
98,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47," I don't want to sleep  in that anymore, okay?"
99,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,You can sleep on the beach if you want to.
100,00:05:10.00,00:05:10.00,I don't want to sleep on the beach anymore.
101,00:05:11.63,00:05:11.63," I don't want to be antisocial,   but I'm going in the woods."
102,00:05:15.00,00:05:15.00,Why don't we just go? Why don't we just start?
103,00:05:22.27,00:05:22.27,We get to move-- it's so exciting
104,00:05:23.93,00:05:23.93,when you get to move to a new place.
105,00:05:25.47,00:05:25.47,"Oh, man, it's hot."
106,00:05:38.30,00:05:38.30,"   GRETCHEN:    If this were, right now,   each man for himself,"
107,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,  Greg would be the victor.
108,00:05:42.00,00:05:42.00, He's relaxed.
109,00:05:43.40,00:05:43.40,He's not fighting this.
110,00:05:44.67,00:05:44.67,It's not like a battle for him.
111,00:05:46.57,00:05:46.57,"Greg's a character, man."
112,00:05:47.97,00:05:47.97,   Hold on one second. Yeah?
113,00:05:49.53,00:05:49.53,   Greg talks into a coconut    and thinks it's a phone.
114,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37, This guy wants    to do an interview
115,00:05:53.70,00:05:53.70,   for four or five minutes.
116,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27, GREG: The naturephone is really a way
117,00:05:57.77,00:05:57.77,"  that I kind of keep in touch with the greater, um..."
118,00:05:59.93,00:05:59.93,  the greater spirit out here.
119,00:06:02.27,00:06:02.27,"All right, listen, well,   uh, yeah, just hold my calls"
120,00:06:05.20,00:06:05.20,"  if, uh, anybody's in this..."
121,00:06:06.70,00:06:06.70, You get reception everywhere.
122,00:06:08.93,00:06:08.93,  You're always incommunicado
123,00:06:11.10,00:06:11.10,"with everything  and anyone, and, uh..."
124,00:06:13.10,00:06:13.10," you know, it's light,  it's quick, it's easy,"
125,00:06:15.33,00:06:15.33,and it's relatively inexpensive.
126,00:06:17.30,00:06:17.30,Do you have a fitting for bamboo?
127,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27,Okay.
128,00:06:20.33,00:06:20.33,"Yeah, yeah, as quickly as possible."
129,00:06:22.93,00:06:22.93,   GRETCHEN:  Greg knows what he's doing--    he kind of
130,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17," manipulates the group,   and I think"
131,00:06:26.63,00:06:26.63,   a lot of people don't even  realize it's going on.
132,00:06:28.13,00:06:28.13,"I think most of the people don't   even realize it's going on,"
133,00:06:30.57,00:06:30.57,"  but in his own way,   Greg's the leader."
134,00:06:32.73,00:06:32.73,"Okay. Yeah, yeah."
135,00:06:33.93,00:06:33.93,"Two min... Okay, bye."
136,00:06:35.27,00:06:35.27,Sorry about that.
137,00:06:36.50,00:06:36.50,Hit Greg in the head.
138,00:06:46.80,00:06:46.80," SEAN:   Sue, she just always keeps    working, working, working."
139,00:06:49.83,00:06:49.83,"  You know, it just drives everybody crazy."
140,00:06:51.70,00:06:51.70," I mean, the guys were talking    about that today."
141,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,   I wish she would slow down for a little bit and just relax.
142,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27, SUSAN:    We're getting by   on coconut and rice.
143,00:06:59.53,00:06:59.53,"  You know,  whatever we can gather,"
144,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,  and we're still not done   looking for tapioca or nuts.
145,00:07:03.57,00:07:03.57,Tapioca.
146,00:07:05.10,00:07:05.10,   Tapioca's supposed    to have red lines.
147,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,Got to find the tapioca.
148,00:07:08.27,00:07:08.27," SEAN:   I had this vision,"
149,00:07:09.77,00:07:09.77," and, uh, I thought I'd   build myself a bowling alley"
150,00:07:12.50,00:07:12.50,   right about here.
151,00:07:14.10,00:07:14.10,"  That's what I'm doing here,  slaving away."
152,00:07:16.40,00:07:16.40,  ( Susan grunts with effort )
153,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50, This little...
154,00:07:22.93,00:07:22.93," Aw, this is all woody."
155,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,"  What I think I might do is,"
156,00:07:26.20,00:07:26.20,  I might take  some of those coconuts
157,00:07:27.50,00:07:27.50,  over there--  that are lined up like that--
158,00:07:29.60,00:07:29.60,I might take that bamboo    over there
159,00:07:30.93,00:07:30.93," and make, like, a little shelf"
160,00:07:32.60,00:07:32.60,  where you can have the extra   balls hanging out up there?
161,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,"No, that's a stalk."
162,00:07:38.37,00:07:38.37,"Oh, is that... that's those big nuts."
163,00:07:41.80,00:07:41.80,   Sean's telling me looking   for nuts is a waste of time.
164,00:07:44.63,00:07:44.63, But at least you know   you can find a nut.
165,00:07:46.67,00:07:46.67, Sean sits there for five hours  and builds his bowling alley.
166,00:07:49.77,00:07:49.77,  He could've been    all getting nuts or looking
167,00:07:52.50,00:07:52.50,  for tapioca during the day.
168,00:07:54.10,00:07:54.10,  I'm tired of feeding people that don't do anything.
169,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17," If we lose tomorrow,   I'm voting Sean off."
170,00:07:58.27,00:07:58.27, My parents would be so proud.
171,00:08:05.20,00:08:05.20," Throughout their time  on the island,"
172,00:08:07.30,00:08:07.30,the tribes will compete    in a series of challenges.
173,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,They'll receive messages
174,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,notifying them of these    competitions at tree mail.
175,00:08:16.40,00:08:16.40, Today's mail    informs both tribes
176,00:08:18.13,00:08:18.13,  about their next     reward challenge
177,00:08:19.87,00:08:19.87,"  called ""Distress Signal."""
178,00:08:21.73,00:08:21.73,"Hey, you guys!"
179,00:08:23.77,00:08:23.77, JEFF:  They'll build an S.O.S.   on their respective beaches.
180,00:08:27.03,00:08:27.03, A plane flying overhead
181,00:08:28.57,00:08:28.57,  will determine whose signal   is the most creative
182,00:08:31.23,00:08:31.23,  and parachute in     a crate full of supplies.
183,00:08:33.40,00:08:33.40,  Both tribes   have been instructed
184,00:08:35.47,00:08:35.47,  to send a representative
185,00:08:37.57,00:08:37.57, to see the creature comforts     they'll be competing for.
186,00:08:39.83,00:08:39.83,We've got a nice luxury going on-- whoa!
187,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60," JEFF:  Things like hammocks,    towels and pillows."
188,00:08:46.60,00:08:46.60,"  Oh, my God!"
189,00:08:48.33,00:08:48.33, JEFF:   But Jenna and Dirk    have each requested
190,00:08:50.43,00:08:50.43,  one additional item     be placed into the crate.
191,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90," We want a spice rack,"
192,00:08:54.03,00:08:54.03,"including salt, pepper, garlic, soy sauce..."
193,00:08:56.53,00:08:56.53,Then you would have a full-out competition for that spice rack.
194,00:08:59.77,00:08:59.77,  What would make it   worthwhile for you?
195,00:09:01.43,00:09:01.43,We need a flay knife.
196,00:09:02.50,00:09:02.50,JEFF: Here's the deal-- two clues
197,00:09:04.40,00:09:04.40,for tomorrow's challenge.
198,00:09:05.77,00:09:05.77,"Do me a favor, though."
199,00:09:06.93,00:09:06.93,Don't open them till you get back to camp.
200,00:09:08.90,00:09:08.90,I'll do what I can about the reward.
201,00:09:10.40,00:09:10.40,Nice talking to you.
202,00:09:10.40,00:09:10.40,Right on.
203,00:09:11.63,00:09:11.63,Nice talking to you guys.
204,00:09:11.63,00:09:11.63,All right!
205,00:09:13.30,00:09:13.30,Thanks for the nap.
206,00:09:13.30,00:09:13.30,All right.
207,00:09:14.30,00:09:14.30,A spice rack is the best.
208,00:09:15.63,00:09:15.63,Good for you.
209,00:09:16.83,00:09:16.83,I wouldn't have thought of that one.
210,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,COLLEEN: What happened?
211,00:09:24.17,00:09:24.17,What did we get?
212,00:09:25.67,00:09:25.67,  We got this.
213,00:09:26.67,00:09:26.67,COLLEEN: What is it?
214,00:09:28.33,00:09:28.33,"Okay, okay, okay."
215,00:09:30.00,00:09:30.00," ""A store you all know   has decided to show"
216,00:09:31.93,00:09:31.93," ""some support  to the survivors here."

222,00:09:43.77,00:09:43.77,Towel!

224,00:09:46.10,00:09:46.10,"""...some toilet paper to wipe off your bum."

227,00:09:54.07,00:09:54.07,"Oh, you guys, we so have this."
228,00:09:56.63,00:09:56.63," Can I tell you something else,    what the prize is?"
229,00:09:58.83,00:09:58.83,"  They added,  because I finagled..."
230,00:10:00.03,00:10:00.03,A spice rack.
231,00:10:01.03,00:10:01.03,"JENNA: Oh, yeah, baby."
232,00:10:02.73,00:10:02.73,  ( cheering )
233,00:10:02.73,00:10:02.73,"Tomorrow morning,"
234,00:10:04.40,00:10:04.40,   a plane flies over   two hours after the sunrise.
235,00:10:07.07,00:10:07.07,And it has to be on our beach--
236,00:10:09.03,00:10:09.03," anything-- a symbol, a word,  you could spell out anything."
237,00:10:12.63,00:10:12.63,"""Naked."""
238,00:10:13.77,00:10:13.77,I know what goes best.
239,00:10:14.83,00:10:14.83,Something really good.
240,00:10:16.07,00:10:16.07,One quick bonfire.
241,00:10:17.07,00:10:17.07,"No, hell, no."
242,00:10:18.20,00:10:18.20,We got to do something bigger and better!
243,00:10:20.47,00:10:20.47,"They do one big bonfire, one big bonfire..."
244,00:10:22.50,00:10:22.50,Yawn.
245,00:10:23.57,00:10:23.57,You do the fire but...
246,00:10:24.57,00:10:24.57,   We got to sell it!
247,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13,   This is like advertising;    we're selling this spot.
248,00:10:28.20,00:10:28.20,Simple but... impact.
249,00:10:31.63,00:10:31.63," GREG: What's creative, though,"
250,00:10:33.33,00:10:33.33,   and exciting to    see from up high?
251,00:10:34.43,00:10:34.43,"  Sex, naked people..."
252,00:10:36.20,00:10:36.20,"We're trapped on    a desert island, you know?"
253,00:10:38.30,00:10:38.30,  We're horny.
254,00:10:39.70,00:10:39.70,  ( laughing )
255,00:10:46.80,00:10:46.80,There's also going to be  a spice rack in there
256,00:10:49.30,00:10:49.30,"and one phat, filthy, stainless steel flay knife."
257,00:10:54.43,00:10:54.43,"Yeah, something we need."
258,00:10:55.87,00:10:55.87,"All right? So, we need, we've got one chance."
259,00:10:58.13,00:10:58.13,We've got to do this right.
260,00:11:00.60,00:11:00.60,Ideas?
261,00:11:02.23,00:11:02.23," RUDY:  Tomorrow, right?  It's gonna be daylight."
262,00:11:03.50,00:11:03.50,   We'll make a    lot of smoke.
263,00:11:04.50,00:11:04.50,"Smoke, a lot of wet wood."
264,00:11:06.73,00:11:06.73,KELLY: We should bring it over by the fire.
265,00:11:08.47,00:11:08.47,Have the fire blazing to all hell.
266,00:11:09.90,00:11:09.90,It's not about size; it's not about fire.
267,00:11:12.10,00:11:12.10,"  Well, fire is going to help."
268,00:11:13.90,00:11:13.90, SEAN:  There's a little bit   of conflict of ideas
269,00:11:15.53,00:11:15.53," between everybody right now,  uh, regarding our next event."
270,00:11:19.50,00:11:19.50,SUSAN: Are you against that?
271,00:11:20.97,00:11:20.97,"  Nobody's against it, but we want to figure..."
272,00:11:22.43,00:11:22.43,"SUSAN: Yeah, but two hours..."
273,00:11:24.30,00:11:24.30,RICHARD:    There was conflict there   between Dirk and Sue
274,00:11:26.60,00:11:26.60,"when she was trying to get going    and Dirk was saying, ""No,"""
275,00:11:30.07,00:11:30.07,and she made fun of his swagger.
276,00:11:32.23,00:11:32.23,"Let's have a clear plan,  then let's go to work,"
277,00:11:34.73,00:11:34.73,   you know what I'm saying?
278,00:11:36.30,00:11:36.30,Okay.
279,00:11:36.30,00:11:36.30,"Thank you, Sue."
280,00:11:37.87,00:11:37.87,The ideas I didn't like   were just some of the things
281,00:11:40.00,00:11:40.00,  that maybe were a little bit tasteless or...
282,00:11:41.83,00:11:41.83,"you know, and don't have  much class, you know?"
283,00:11:43.67,00:11:43.67,"  I believe that class kind of shows itself, and things like..."
284,00:11:46.03,00:11:46.03,Condoms.
285,00:11:47.03,00:11:47.03,If we had enough condoms
286,00:11:48.13,00:11:48.13,"and they were different-colored,"
287,00:11:49.70,00:11:49.70,that would be so funny.
288,00:11:51.30,00:11:51.30,"  I don't know if that    has much class, you know."
289,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,You guys could put the little orange thingies on your wieners.
290,00:11:55.40,00:11:55.40,   That's not very creative.
291,00:11:56.90,00:11:56.90,  That's just looking    in a bathroom stall wall.
292,00:11:58.77,00:11:58.77,RICHARD: We can also use
293,00:12:01.27,00:12:01.27,those white Styrofoam floats
294,00:12:02.53,00:12:02.53,and create a big arrow in the water
295,00:12:04.10,00:12:04.10,"that's, you know, pointed right toward the beach."
296,00:12:06.23,00:12:06.23,That's an idea; that's an idea.
297,00:12:08.37,00:12:08.37, I don't think  we can do it together
298,00:12:09.87,00:12:09.87,  without the things floating   all discombobulated.
299,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,"   Yay, Mr. Positive.    All right."
300,00:12:13.97,00:12:13.97,RICHARD:    An idea comes up and you     can see on people's faces
301,00:12:16.53,00:12:16.53,"when Sean is negative about it,"
302,00:12:18.37,00:12:18.37,and then they'll just harp on it  and make it...
303,00:12:21.27,00:12:21.27,   want it even more.
304,00:12:23.13,00:12:23.13,SEAN: I just think that we need
305,00:12:24.23,00:12:24.23,to do something simple but extravagant.
306,00:12:25.80,00:12:25.80, Like one thing   that we all work on.
307,00:12:27.57,00:12:27.57," You know, similar to, like...   like the Rose Bowl."
308,00:12:30.17,00:12:30.17," SEAN:    I just wish people would,   you know, see things my way,"
309,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,"  in terms of,   I think that what they want"
310,00:12:34.70,00:12:34.70,"is something really spectacular,"
311,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40, and I think that we could work    through the night and build
312,00:12:38.23,00:12:38.23, something really spectacular
313,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77, that would ensure us   getting that crate.
314,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,"What's happening in my head is,   ""Here's the conflict."
315,00:12:43.30,00:12:43.30,"  ""Here comes the dynamics that suck."
316,00:12:44.97,00:12:44.97,"   ""Here come the people that   just shout and don't listen."
317,00:12:47.73,00:12:47.73,"   Here comes the negativity,    and here comes the crap."""
318,00:12:50.03,00:12:50.03,You talk about doing a float
319,00:12:52.77,00:12:52.77,  or something that...
320,00:12:52.77,00:12:52.77,"Not a float, a project."
321,00:12:54.83,00:12:54.83,"   I know, a project."
322,00:12:54.83,00:12:54.83,"It could be a big ""X."""
323,00:12:56.83,00:12:56.83,"You know, we build a tremendous ""X"""
324,00:12:58.10,00:12:58.10,in the sand and stand it up.
325,00:13:00.10,00:13:00.10,Did you think I was done with my sentence?
326,00:13:02.03,00:13:02.03,"Well, I know what the resolution to the conflict"
327,00:13:05.20,00:13:05.20," that exists right now    would be at home,"
328,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,   but I'm actually planning  something different from that
329,00:13:10.67,00:13:10.67," that might benefit me,    and it's a little sneaky."
330,00:13:13.40,00:13:13.40, ( chuckling )
331,00:13:14.83,00:13:14.83, I think     I'm going to handle this
332,00:13:16.50,00:13:16.50, by beginning   to develop alliances
333,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23, with some folks
334,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00, to ensure that I move  into the next round.
335,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,   That means we need to clean up that beach.
336,00:13:40.57,00:13:40.57, JENNA:  I don't think Ramona's    pulling her weight.
337,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,"I think that she really thought  she could handle this,"
338,00:13:44.97,00:13:44.97, and now she's finding    that I don't think she...
339,00:13:47.00,00:13:47.00,she can as much as she thought.
340,00:13:49.37,00:13:49.37,  Ugh.
341,00:13:50.90,00:13:50.90," Yesterday was bad, bad night."
342,00:13:53.70,00:13:53.70, The only thing    Ramona can be is herself.
343,00:13:56.47,00:13:56.47,   I'm a mama's girl.
344,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67,"   Well, I'm mama's    only child, so..."
345,00:14:02.07,00:14:02.07, She has great gifts to offer.
346,00:14:04.40,00:14:04.40,   Maybe she will be able to.
347,00:14:06.37,00:14:06.37,Maybe she won't.
348,00:14:07.63,00:14:07.63,"But I can't do any more  than I can do,"
349,00:14:11.23,00:14:11.23,and I'm not going to try and bust my ass
350,00:14:12.90,00:14:12.90,  and try and prove something.
351,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37," Every chance she got,  she was just making it worse."
352,00:14:16.53,00:14:16.53,And I'll expend extra energy.
353,00:14:19.40,00:14:19.40,I'll give this one to him.
354,00:14:22.33,00:14:22.33,I tried to pull her to the side and just
355,00:14:23.57,00:14:23.57,point certain things out to her
356,00:14:24.77,00:14:24.77,  and try to get her
357,00:14:26.43,00:14:26.43,  to correct that situation.
358,00:14:28.30,00:14:28.30,"Everybody's in cliques,   and I'm, like, here."
359,00:14:31.50,00:14:31.50,It's all about everybody   being nice.
360,00:14:33.80,00:14:33.80,"You don't want to be out there kissing everybody's ass,"
361,00:14:36.00,00:14:36.00,you know what I mean?
362,00:14:37.47,00:14:37.47,"Don't start withdrawing in yourself now,"
363,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33," you know, like... going solo."
364,00:15:19.80,00:15:19.80, DIRK:   I really like our slogan--    I think it's going
365,00:15:22.07,00:15:22.07, to grab someone's attention.
366,00:15:23.47,00:15:23.47, We're giving it our best shot.
367,00:15:24.87,00:15:24.87,We want to win.
368,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,"GERVASE:   Work-wise,    Ramona seemed today"
369,00:15:36.40,00:15:36.40,"  to be, ""Oh, I'll help here, I'll help here."
370,00:15:39.07,00:15:39.07,"  I'll do this, I'll do that."""
371,00:15:41.03,00:15:41.03,"RAMONA:  I feel more like a part   of the group,"
372,00:15:43.47,00:15:43.47,  and I don't know if that's
373,00:15:46.07,00:15:46.07,   because I'm feeling better
374,00:15:47.60,00:15:47.60," and therefore   I'm working more and harder,"
375,00:15:49.97,00:15:49.97,"   or if it's because, like,  I've started to assert myself."
376,00:15:52.60,00:15:52.60," I don't know,    I guess it's a combination."
377,00:15:59.03,00:15:59.03,GERVASE:   Looking forward to getting   a spice rack
378,00:16:02.87,00:16:02.87, to flavor up the rice.
379,00:16:04.10,00:16:04.10,And towels. I'm the only one who wants towels.
380,00:16:06.43,00:16:06.43,And pillows. I like the pillows.
381,00:16:11.27,00:16:11.27,Where do you want to cross?
382,00:16:12.53,00:16:12.53,"Um, right here."
383,00:16:13.53,00:16:13.53,Here.
384,00:16:15.40,00:16:15.40," Yeah... yeah,    we're all on island time."
385,00:16:15.40,00:16:15.40,Who you talking to?!
386,00:16:18.10,00:16:18.10,"   The pilot, the pilot of the plane."
387,00:16:21.33,00:16:21.33,Can you hear me?!
388,00:16:23.20,00:16:23.20, Yeah. I don't want to tell you   exactly what it looks like.
389,00:16:26.47,00:16:26.47,"  It's, uh...  just put it this way:"
390,00:16:28.27,00:16:28.27, we're all very excited   to be here.
391,00:16:42.30,00:16:42.30," JEFF:    It's 10:11 on the island,"
392,00:16:45.10,00:16:45.10,"and aside from the ever-present  desire for more food,"

450,00:19:56.50,00:19:56.50,Ah! We like it there.
451,00:19:57.77,00:19:57.77,  Ooh!
452,00:19:59.70,00:19:59.70,   Look at the knife!
453,00:20:01.03,00:20:01.03, Yeah!

455,00:20:03.73,00:20:03.73,Now we're eating.
456,00:20:04.80,00:20:04.80,Spices.
457,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,   Salt.
458,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,This looks like oregano.
459,00:20:07.90,00:20:07.90,What do we got in there?
460,00:20:09.07,00:20:09.07, Curry.
461,00:20:11.47,00:20:11.47,I think this is garlic.

463,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,you'll always find it-- around my thigh.
464,00:20:17.27,00:20:17.27,You think they're bummed about their spices?
465,00:20:19.30,00:20:19.30,I'll take a victory over Jenna right now.
466,00:20:21.83,00:20:21.83,Groggy no more.
467,00:20:23.23,00:20:23.23,"That's right, man."
468,00:20:27.33,00:20:27.33, I didn't like
469,00:20:29.00,00:20:29.00,   the final decision   for the S.O.S. Game.
470,00:20:31.20,00:20:31.20, I thought it was quite silly--  a smiley face?
471,00:20:34.07,00:20:34.07,Give me a break.
472,00:20:35.60,00:20:35.60,   I didn't expect us  to win anyway.

474,00:20:40.43,00:20:40.43, So it's another day of rice.

476,00:20:44.03,00:20:44.03,I hate to lose.
477,00:20:46.43,00:20:46.43,   It sucks.

479,00:20:50.73,00:20:50.73,  trying to look up.
480,00:20:59.60,00:20:59.60, KELLY:  The whole idea of an alliance
481,00:21:02.33,00:21:02.33,  is to make sure we're all...   voting the same way.
482,00:21:06.33,00:21:06.33,So are we going to stick to it?
483,00:21:08.10,00:21:08.10,I'm going to stick to it.
484,00:21:09.60,00:21:09.60,"RICHARD:  So the, um..."
485,00:21:10.93,00:21:10.93," alliances have begun,"
486,00:21:12.53,00:21:12.53, and I didn't even have   to do much about it.
487,00:21:15.63,00:21:15.63,I don't want to vote anyone off...
488,00:21:17.10,00:21:17.10,"I agree with Rich, I think, about the Sean thing."
489,00:21:19.57,00:21:19.57,Yeah.
490,00:21:21.50,00:21:21.50, KELLY:  Sue and I had discussed     on our own about
491,00:21:25.00,00:21:25.00,getting Richard in the same vote
492,00:21:27.23,00:21:27.23,  and us three having  the same vote.
493,00:21:29.13,00:21:29.13,"So no matter what, even if we never talk again,"
494,00:21:31.47,00:21:31.47,the next vote is...?
495,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50, KELLY:   Because the more people you    know that are going to vote
496,00:21:36.20,00:21:36.20,"   for somebody else, you might as well go with that."
497,00:21:39.20,00:21:39.20,"  You might as well, you know,   keep yourself safe,"
498,00:21:42.00,00:21:42.00," and, you know, keep it in the majority."
499,00:21:44.37,00:21:44.37,"  We have alliances that are   happening within the group,"
500,00:21:46.93,00:21:46.93," and you're going to have that,"
501,00:21:48.60,00:21:48.60,"just because, you know,  everybody's..."
502,00:21:50.47,00:21:50.47,"  hey, there's money involved."
503,00:21:51.90,00:21:51.90,We really could control our fate
504,00:21:53.83,00:21:53.83, if we stick together.
505,00:21:56.20,00:21:56.20,"I think what's going to happen in the end,"
506,00:21:58.33,00:21:58.33, there'll be alliances.
507,00:21:59.60,00:21:59.60,There could be.
508,00:21:59.60,00:21:59.60,"Oh, yeah!"
509,00:22:01.37,00:22:01.37, KELLY:  We really like Rudy.
510,00:22:03.17,00:22:03.17," Rudy's kind of crabby,  but he's a lot better"
511,00:22:06.03,00:22:06.03,"  to get along with, you know,    than the two boys."
512,00:22:07.73,00:22:07.73, At least he's honest.
513,00:22:09.33,00:22:09.33,"   You know, he'll tell you,    you know,"
514,00:22:10.83,00:22:10.83,"""Up yours,"" in a second."
515,00:22:12.17,00:22:12.17,Sue!
516,00:22:13.60,00:22:13.60,"   What, if anything, should be said to Rudy?"
517,00:22:15.73,00:22:15.73, RUDY:   Somebody said that
518,00:22:17.27,00:22:17.27," if you want to sort of gang up     against somebody,"
519,00:22:20.53,00:22:20.53,  you ought to talk about it
520,00:22:22.40,00:22:22.40,"  to get rid of them, but, uh, I don't agree with that,"
521,00:22:25.40,00:22:25.40,  so I'm not doing it.
522,00:22:26.80,00:22:26.80,  I don't know about the rest of them.
523,00:22:28.37,00:22:28.37,RICHARD: It's hard to kind of trust people
524,00:22:30.00,00:22:30.00,"completely and thoroughly, but I think"
525,00:22:31.57,00:22:31.57,"until the next segment, the three of us"
526,00:22:33.37,00:22:33.37,can work together really well.
527,00:22:34.63,00:22:34.63, I trust you  completely.
528,00:22:34.63,00:22:34.63,Yeah.
529,00:22:36.40,00:22:36.40,"RICHARD:  I think we can trust  the three of our votes,"
530,00:22:38.57,00:22:38.57," 'cause if one of us blows up,   trustworthiness-wise,"
531,00:22:42.00,00:22:42.00,then this whole thing's  out the window
532,00:22:43.83,00:22:43.83,and it's... it's a free-for-all.
533,00:22:45.60,00:22:45.60,The three of us against the world.
534,00:22:47.90,00:22:47.90,( laughing )
535,00:22:54.10,00:22:54.10,This is going to be so good.
536,00:22:56.63,00:22:56.63, You want a small spoon or a big spoon?
537,00:22:59.53,00:22:59.53,   I'll take a small one    'cause I got a big mouth.
538,00:23:02.67,00:23:02.67,   Jenna-- she's like   this Energizer bunny
539,00:23:04.87,00:23:04.87,"that, like, keeps going    and going"
540,00:23:06.60,00:23:06.60,  and going.
541,00:23:07.87,00:23:07.87,( trilling )
542,00:23:09.23,00:23:09.23,Pagong!
543,00:23:10.87,00:23:10.87,"RAMONA:   Like, I haven't had  a white friend"
544,00:23:12.67,00:23:12.67," since, like,    junior high school,"
545,00:23:15.23,00:23:15.23,"and I really can see her   being, like,"
546,00:23:18.03,00:23:18.03, my first white friend  in a long time.
547,00:23:21.50,00:23:21.50,   GRETCHEN:  I think Ramona's change  has to do with
548,00:23:23.43,00:23:23.43,"she's feeling more comfortable,  she's feeling better."
549,00:23:26.57,00:23:26.57," She feels like  she's more part of the group,"
550,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83, which I don't think she felt  in the very beginning.
551,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,I'll help you with that in a second.
552,00:23:32.10,00:23:32.10,   I'm almost done with this.
553,00:23:33.60,00:23:33.60, I think we've definitely seen  Ramona's redemption this week.
554,00:23:36.50,00:23:36.50,I'll come and help in a second!
555,00:23:38.83,00:23:38.83,GERVASE:  Looks like she's turned  things around.
556,00:23:41.43,00:23:41.43,"   That's in my eyes, she's redeemed herself."
557,00:23:43.53,00:23:43.53,"Other people's eyes, it could be"
558,00:23:45.50,00:23:45.50,  totally different.
559,00:23:47.63,00:23:47.63,   I think Ramona has changed
560,00:23:48.87,00:23:48.87,her attitude...
561,00:23:50.33,00:23:50.33,"   Well, no. Changed  her work ethic a lot."
562,00:23:52.60,00:23:52.60, But I don't think her attitude     has changed much.
563,00:23:56.23,00:23:56.23," She is working more,   she's trying,"
564,00:23:57.90,00:23:57.90, but I think maybe it is
565,00:23:59.53,00:23:59.53, a little too little too late.
566,00:24:07.63,00:24:07.63,RAMONA:  This is what I'm like
567,00:24:10.23,00:24:10.23,   every day when I'm feeling    like at a hundred percent.
568,00:24:14.07,00:24:14.07,"  You want to play rough, huh?"
569,00:24:16.37,00:24:16.37,  I'm feeling... good about
570,00:24:19.20,00:24:19.20,   being a part of the group.

579,00:25:08.57,00:25:08.57, then they're two people short
580,00:25:10.37,00:25:10.37,"  of what we have,"

583,00:25:15.80,00:25:15.80,  I don't want to make    that trek tonight.

595,00:25:42.60,00:25:42.60,"""make the wrong call, and it could be you voted out."""
596,00:25:45.93,00:25:45.93,"JOEL: What do you think, Greg?"
597,00:25:47.40,00:25:47.40,What?
598,00:25:48.40,00:25:48.40,"Plan A, we plan everything out,"
599,00:25:50.13,00:25:50.13,"   and then plan B, we throw    everything out the window"
600,00:25:52.33,00:25:52.33,   when we get there   and completely panic
601,00:25:54.10,00:25:54.10,and do whatever we think    we should.
602,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80,GERVASE:   We'll win.
603,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80,  Both.
604,00:25:57.50,00:25:57.50,"  It might be close, but we'll  definitely win today."
605,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,Without a doubt.
606,00:26:08.67,00:26:08.67, We got to win this immunity challenge.
607,00:26:10.80,00:26:10.80,  We got to stomp them so bad.
608,00:26:13.13,00:26:13.13,"We're excited for the challenge,    we feel confident,"
609,00:26:15.47,00:26:15.47,  and we feel ready.
610,00:26:16.87,00:26:16.87," JOEL:    Yeah, this is a big one,"
611,00:26:19.23,00:26:19.23,   and this is huge.
612,00:26:20.63,00:26:20.63,"  Um, you know, yeah, we don't want to lose this one."
613,00:26:23.10,00:26:23.10," We're here to compete,"
614,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60," and we're here    to win these competitions,"
615,00:26:26.63,00:26:26.63,   and we're here to do them    as a team.
616,00:26:28.40,00:26:28.40, I wouldn't say    we're-we're cocky.
617,00:26:30.37,00:26:30.37,"I just think that we're,   uh, we're the best."
618,00:26:39.70,00:26:39.70," Welcome, guys."
619,00:26:39.70,00:26:39.70,Hey.
620,00:26:42.10,00:26:42.10,  I'll take the idol-- back up for grabs today.
621,00:26:44.57,00:26:44.57,Welcome to Asmara Beach.
622,00:26:47.43,00:26:47.43,"  It's a relay today,    so the sum"
623,00:26:49.30,00:26:49.30, of all    of your individual efforts
624,00:26:51.60,00:26:51.60, will determine who wins and who loses.
625,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27, If one person  completely falls down
626,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,   their team could crumble--  they may end up paying
627,00:26:58.07,00:26:58.07,   for those actions tonight  at the Tribal Council.
628,00:27:00.97,00:27:00.97,"  Colleen, come on up.  Who's your..."
629,00:27:02.60,00:27:02.60,"  Sean. Okay,  you guys come up here,"
630,00:27:04.47,00:27:04.47, and I'll explain this using this map.
631,00:27:06.67,00:27:06.67,  There are five legs  in the relay.
632,00:27:08.77,00:27:08.77,   The first leg is the swim.
633,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,   You'll start here    and head for these buoys.
634,00:27:13.10,00:27:13.10," Directly underneath is a bottle, which contains a map."
635,00:27:16.47,00:27:16.47, Grab the bottle
636,00:27:17.83,00:27:17.83,  and pass it  to one of your tribe members.
637,00:27:20.30,00:27:20.30,"  For the second leg,"
638,00:27:21.73,00:27:21.73, you'll run the bottle   across this floating bridge
639,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73, into an awaiting boat.
640,00:27:25.77,00:27:25.77,"  The third leg is the paddle,   where you'll head for shore"
641,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,and hand the bottle off.
642,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63, Inside of it is a map
643,00:27:31.07,00:27:31.07,showing the destinations  for the remaining two events.
644,00:27:33.93,00:27:33.93,   The fourth leg is    a sprint into the jungle.
645,00:27:36.30,00:27:36.30,"   Using the map, the runner    will find a rope ladder."
646,00:27:39.07,00:27:39.07,"  Climb up it,  and you'll grab a key."
647,00:27:40.93,00:27:40.93,"  For the fifth and final leg,"
648,00:27:42.43,00:27:42.43, two members of your tribe will locate the buried treasure chest
649,00:27:45.40,00:27:45.40, and dig it up.
650,00:27:46.90,00:27:46.90,The first team to get your chest    back on your crate
651,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,with the key in the lock
652,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17, wins immunity.
653,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77, ALL:  Tagi!
654,00:27:54.13,00:27:54.13,  ALL: Pagong!
655,00:27:55.13,00:27:55.13,"All right, guys,"
656,00:27:56.43,00:27:56.43, thermometer's topping   100 degrees.
657,00:27:57.57,00:27:57.57,This is for immunity.
658,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,Whoo!
659,00:28:00.33,00:28:00.33,Survivors ready?

665,00:28:08.43,00:28:08.43,All right!

673,00:28:57.33,00:28:57.33,"Go, Sean!"
674,00:28:59.33,00:28:59.33,"Way to go, Joel!"
675,00:29:00.60,00:29:00.60,"Go, guys, go!"
676,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,"MAN: Bring it in, now, bring it in!"
677,00:29:07.73,00:29:07.73,Get the bottle! Get the bottle!
678,00:29:10.07,00:29:10.07," Come on, guys!"
679,00:29:14.70,00:29:14.70,Take it!
680,00:29:15.97,00:29:15.97,"WOMAN: Come on, guys! Come on, guys!"
681,00:29:18.43,00:29:18.43,  Go.
682,00:29:19.57,00:29:19.57,WOMAN: You're almost there.

685,00:29:27.63,00:29:27.63,"Come on, break."
686,00:29:29.30,00:29:29.30,Whoa.
687,00:29:31.47,00:29:31.47,"GRETCHEN: Come on, Greg! Come on, Greg!"
688,00:29:34.80,00:29:34.80,WOMAN: Break it. Break it!
689,00:29:36.70,00:29:36.70,It's open.

691,00:29:39.00,00:29:39.00,Got it.
692,00:29:41.33,00:29:41.33,   Don't rip it.
693,00:29:43.40,00:29:43.40,"MAN: Go, Dirk!"
694,00:29:58.63,00:29:58.63,Go!
695,00:30:09.23,00:30:09.23,"RUDY: We don't have it yet, either."
696,00:30:10.67,00:30:10.67,"KELLY: Come on, you guys."
697,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,"   Let's go! Dig, guys, dig!"
698,00:30:17.63,00:30:17.63,"All right, ladies, looking good!"
699,00:30:59.80,00:30:59.80,"RAMONA: Come on, ladies!"
700,00:31:12.20,00:31:12.20,RICHARD: Get the shovel and dig around it a little bit.
701,00:31:14.73,00:31:14.73,It's not going to budge.
702,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,MAN: Don't stop!
703,00:31:19.77,00:31:19.77,Don't quit!

705,00:31:28.03,00:31:28.03,"Come on, Richie!"
706,00:31:30.07,00:31:30.07,Get it in there! Come on!
707,00:31:31.60,00:31:31.60,"   Come on, you guys,    it's down there somewhere."
708,00:31:33.83,00:31:33.83,( yelling )
709,00:31:36.10,00:31:36.10,"JOEL: Dig in, girls, dig in!"
710,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,"Dig in, dig in!"
711,00:31:39.67,00:31:39.67,MAN: Here he comes.

714,00:31:44.57,00:31:44.57,( yelping )
715,00:31:45.57,00:31:45.57,"RAMONA: Come on, ladies,"
716,00:31:48.87,00:31:48.87,we got the key!
717,00:31:50.17,00:31:50.17,  ( cheering )
718,00:31:57.20,00:31:57.20,"   Run, Rudy!"
719,00:31:58.30,00:31:58.30,Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
720,00:32:00.13,00:32:00.13,  ( yelling )
721,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,Come on!
722,00:32:03.37,00:32:03.37,Yeah! Yeah!
723,00:32:05.17,00:32:05.17,Put the key in it!
724,00:32:07.73,00:32:07.73,"Come on, Rich!"
725,00:32:09.73,00:32:09.73,  ( yelling )
726,00:32:14.03,00:32:14.03,We did our best.
727,00:32:19.10,00:32:19.10,We did our best.
728,00:32:20.40,00:32:20.40,That's not good enough.
729,00:32:21.63,00:32:21.63,The idol.
730,00:32:22.63,00:32:22.63,"SUSAN: Oh, yeah!"
731,00:32:26.50,00:32:26.50,"JEFF: Tagi, nice job."
732,00:32:27.60,00:32:27.60,   Nice job.
733,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,"WOMAN: Good job, you guys."
734,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17," Pagong, I'll see you tonight-- Tribal Council."
735,00:33:29.57,00:33:29.57,GERVASE:    The most difficult thing    of this whole thing for me
736,00:33:32.87,00:33:32.87,is to vote somebody off.
737,00:33:34.27,00:33:34.27,  I think we're dreading that.
738,00:33:35.97,00:33:35.97, JENNA:  Going to this island  council meeting tonight
739,00:33:38.47,00:33:38.47,  it's really tough.
740,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,  The thought of eliminating    any of these people
741,00:33:42.33,00:33:42.33,"   that we're placing    all of our confidence in,"
742,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,  it's getting worse.
743,00:33:46.10,00:33:46.10,I can't imagine    and I can't fathom
744,00:33:48.43,00:33:48.43,  voting off somebody from this team tonight.
745,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"I'm going, not knowing what's going to happen,"
746,00:34:03.57,00:34:03.57,and I'm nervous.
747,00:34:04.87,00:34:04.87,I wish I started slower.
748,00:34:06.50,00:34:06.50,And then I wish it wasn't so far.
749,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,I'm nervous about votes being against me tonight
750,00:34:11.30,00:34:11.30, because of...
751,00:34:13.10,00:34:13.10,  I'm not a champion   in the competition.
752,00:34:17.53,00:34:17.53,"  Speed-wise, we got right down there."
753,00:34:19.70,00:34:19.70,"   We got right down  to the treasure chest,"
754,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,"and it just kept collapsing in,    and it was so devastating."
755,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,  All day I had this feeling   that my leg would be the one
756,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,"  that would lose it for us,    and it did."
757,00:34:28.67,00:34:28.67,"It does make me feel vulnerable,    um, for the vote tonight."
758,00:34:36.33,00:34:36.33,"GERVASE: If somebody had to go right now   in our tribe,"
759,00:34:39.20,00:34:39.20," I would vote for Jenna,"
760,00:34:40.63,00:34:40.63,  because she's more annoying   than Colleen.
761,00:34:43.10,00:34:43.10,"I could deal with Jenna not being here,"
762,00:34:44.73,00:34:44.73, then just keep Colleen around a little longer.
763,00:34:47.13,00:34:47.13,"   We're all friends,    and then you boot someone."
764,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,It's like the board game Sorry.
765,00:34:52.23,00:34:52.23, You pick the card and you got  to take your thing and smash
766,00:34:55.53,00:34:55.53, the other guy out of the way.
767,00:34:57.60,00:34:57.60,"  Knock 'em out, that's that,   you move on."
768,00:34:59.53,00:34:59.53, Sor-r-r-r-ry!
769,00:35:14.90,00:35:14.90,"This is Tribal Council,"
770,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,"  where each week, one member  will be voted off the island."
771,00:35:20.67,00:35:20.67,"  The last time Pagong went    to Tribal Council,"
772,00:35:23.30,00:35:23.30, Ramona got three votes.
773,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77, Is she still at risk?
774,00:35:27.37,00:35:27.37,nWill Gervase's weak performances
775,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83, in the last several challenges     cost him?
776,00:35:32.60,00:35:32.60, Or will it be someone  nobody expects?
777,00:35:58.77,00:35:58.77, ( gong tolls )
778,00:36:28.63,00:36:28.63,   Go ahead and take a seat.
779,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"So here we are again...    with the unpleasant task,"
780,00:36:39.73,00:36:39.73, yet you actually have  a very tough mandate.
781,00:36:42.23,00:36:42.23,You have to vote one
782,00:36:43.93,00:36:43.93,of your tribe members off the island tonight.
783,00:36:46.50,00:36:46.50,And I think what makes it equally hard
784,00:36:48.10,00:36:48.10,"is that in doing so, you're sort of forced"
785,00:36:50.57,00:36:50.57,to hold a mirror up to yourselves.
786,00:36:52.37,00:36:52.37,"Ramona, what criteria do you use"
787,00:36:55.50,00:36:55.50,in determining who you're going to vote off the island?
788,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,   Everything is so dynamic.
789,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,"   I mean, I could have been"
790,00:37:02.90,00:37:02.90,  thinking one person    when we left camp
791,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,and have    a totally different person
792,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00," in my mind now, so..."
793,00:37:08.57,00:37:08.57," I mean, nobody, like,  totally sucks, so..."
794,00:37:10.90,00:37:10.90,"it's like, mmm, at this point,"
795,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,"I mean, we all like each other,   so it's not like..."
796,00:37:17.70,00:37:17.70,"I mean, it would  almost even be easier"
797,00:37:20.10,00:37:20.10,"  if we didn't like each other   and I was like, ""I hate you!"
798,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,"  You're outta here!"""
799,00:37:24.87,00:37:24.87, But we like each other
800,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23,"so it's like, I don't know."
801,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,"   I mean, it's how you feel   at that time"
802,00:37:30.23,00:37:30.23,"when you go up to write their name, it's like..."
803,00:37:32.83,00:37:32.83,"  ""Mmm... all right."""
804,00:37:34.20,00:37:34.20,"  And you want to keep  the team strong, so..."
805,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,that's probably the main thing.
806,00:37:39.03,00:37:39.03,Anybody feel
807,00:37:40.50,00:37:40.50,confident enough that they want to own up
808,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,"to feeling invincible in tonight's vote,"
809,00:37:47.07,00:37:47.07,"certain that when this is over, they will be here?"
810,00:37:51.77,00:37:51.77,( laughs )
811,00:37:53.00,00:37:53.00,"   You go, G."
812,00:37:54.93,00:37:54.93,I'll be around.
813,00:37:56.40,00:37:56.40,  I'm looking to hang   till the final four.
814,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,"Well, it's interesting that you say that,"
815,00:38:02.23,00:38:02.23,"because for the last three challenges,"
816,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,you were somewhat responsible for your tribe's loss.
817,00:38:06.70,00:38:06.70,"Bugging out with those bugs, in from the deep,"
818,00:38:08.93,00:38:08.93,swimming-- for somebody
819,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,"  who's still really learning   how to swim,"
820,00:38:12.43,00:38:12.43,  you took that on heartily--
821,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,"and then today, I think it says a lot about you"
822,00:38:16.60,00:38:16.60,that you still feel that confident
823,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,that you aren't going anywhere.
824,00:38:20.07,00:38:20.07, Nah. I feel quite comfortable  in my position on this island.
825,00:38:24.60,00:38:24.60,  Okay. Anybody want to own up
826,00:38:26.53,00:38:26.53,to feeling vulnerable tonight?
827,00:38:32.43,00:38:32.43,  ( laughter )
828,00:38:36.17,00:38:36.17," I think I may have just played myself out on the last question,"
829,00:38:41.97,00:38:41.97,"so I'm feeling quite vulnerable    right now,"
830,00:38:44.60,00:38:44.60,"  but, I mean,  I'll be back tomorrow."
831,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,  ( laughter )
832,00:38:47.70,00:38:47.70,"Jenna, you're going"
833,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,"to walk over there, you're going   to pick up that pen,"
834,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,   you're going to write down a name.
835,00:38:53.00,00:38:53.00,"   Is it going to feel good,"
836,00:38:54.20,00:38:54.20,or is it going to feel bad?
837,00:38:56.40,00:38:56.40, I feel guilty.
838,00:38:57.97,00:38:57.97,  I feel bad.
839,00:38:59.77,00:38:59.77,Why do you feel guilty?
840,00:39:01.37,00:39:01.37,"Well, I mean, I'm going to have   to put somebody's name down"
841,00:39:03.97,00:39:03.97, that I really respect  and have come to really like.
842,00:39:06.23,00:39:06.23,It's like taking a piece of our family away.
843,00:39:08.83,00:39:08.83,   You may say that it    may strengthen the    team because you take
844,00:39:10.73,00:39:10.73,"the weakest link, but I don't think so,"
845,00:39:12.13,00:39:12.13,because we're so strong right now.
846,00:39:13.83,00:39:13.83,   You take one of us away--    I don't care who it is--
847,00:39:15.83,00:39:15.83, and you've got a weaker tribe.
848,00:39:17.53,00:39:17.53,   All right. It's time to vote.
849,00:39:20.70,00:39:20.70,Gervase.
850,00:39:43.77,00:39:43.77,My vote is for Colleen.
851,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70," We don't know what lies ahead  right now, but we're hurting."
852,00:39:49.23,00:39:49.23,   So I think we need to stay  as strong as possible.
853,00:39:51.93,00:39:51.93,"I mean, I love the girl to death, but..."
854,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37," somebody's got to go,  so it's got to be for Colleen."
855,00:40:21.87,00:40:21.87,   Self-fulfilling prophecy.
856,00:40:24.47,00:40:24.47,  It seems time to go.
857,00:40:37.77,00:40:37.77,  No comment.
858,00:40:50.10,00:40:50.10," Because even though she tried    to redeem herself,"
859,00:40:53.77,00:40:53.77," a little too little, too late."
860,00:41:05.03,00:41:05.03,"Before I read the votes,"
861,00:41:06.67,00:41:06.67,"I just want to remind you that, once they're tallied,"
862,00:41:09.27,00:41:09.27,"the decision is final, and the person"
863,00:41:11.13,00:41:11.13,will need to leave the island immediately.
864,00:41:13.30,00:41:13.30,"  You'll go down this bridge, follow the path,"
865,00:41:15.87,00:41:15.87,and about 200 feet down    is a confessional.
866,00:41:18.20,00:41:18.20,  You can speak as long as you like to say all your good-byes.
867,00:41:21.70,00:41:21.70,  Sound good?
868,00:41:22.97,00:41:22.97,   All right.
869,00:41:23.97,00:41:23.97,Read the votes.
870,00:41:28.37,00:41:28.37,  First vote.

878,00:42:10.33,00:42:10.33,   Last vote.

880,00:42:17.87,00:42:17.87,"Good luck, Ramona."
881,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,"Need for you to grab your torch, Ramona."
882,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,The tribe has spoken.
883,00:42:54.07,00:42:54.07,Time for you to go.
884,00:42:58.47,00:42:58.47,"Bye, Ramona."
885,00:43:13.70,00:43:13.70,JEFF: Survived another one.
886,00:43:15.07,00:43:15.07,  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
887,00:43:16.60,00:43:16.60,Good night.
888,00:43:21.73,00:43:21.73,  ( tribal chanting )
889,00:43:41.60,00:43:41.60, JEFF:  Next week on Survivor:
890,00:43:43.33,00:43:43.33, SUSAN:  You guys wasted
891,00:43:44.73,00:43:44.73,   three days fishing during the day.
892,00:43:46.10,00:43:46.10,I don't think it was a waste.
893,00:43:46.10,00:43:46.10,Did you catch anything?
894,00:43:48.13,00:43:48.13,"No, ma'am."
895,00:43:48.13,00:43:48.13," It was a waste of time, then."
896,00:43:50.50,00:43:50.50, It's expected to get  on each other's nerves.
897,00:43:52.97,00:43:52.97," Everyone's on my nerves, too,"
898,00:43:54.33,00:43:54.33,but I just don't really    act on it.
899,00:43:55.33,00:43:55.33,"COLLEEN:  When we go off,"
900,00:43:56.40,00:43:56.40,  it's all about sex.
901,00:43:57.80,00:43:57.80, It's really passionate affair    right now.

904,00:44:07.10,00:44:07.10,   I think the first two days that I was sick
905,00:44:09.60,00:44:09.60,"  just really, really hurt me,   'cause those first two days"
906,00:44:13.00,00:44:13.00,"were crucial in forming relationships and stuff,"
907,00:44:15.77,00:44:15.77,and I really didn't get   a chance to do that
908,00:44:18.10,00:44:18.10,because I was so sick...
909,00:44:19.80,00:44:19.80,"  And I guess I'm signing off,   and I'm, uh... out of here."
