2,00:00:05.57,00:00:05.57, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:09.37,00:00:09.37," Marooned for 39 days, they must work together"
4,00:00:13.30,00:00:13.30,"  to build shelter, find food and survive the island,"
5,00:00:17.43,00:00:17.43," but ultimately, it is everyone for themselves."
6,00:00:20.40,00:00:20.40," Every third night, they will    hike deep into the jungle"
7,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67, to take part  in the Tribal Council
8,00:00:26.40,00:00:26.40,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
9,00:00:30.43,00:00:30.43,"  In the end,  only one will remain"
10,00:00:32.67,00:00:32.67,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
11,00:00:39.50,00:00:39.50, Last week on Survivor:
12,00:00:41.67,00:00:41.67,  Conflict within the tribes  continued to emerge.
13,00:00:44.37,00:00:44.37,  You can onlytake so much preaching.
14,00:00:46.53,00:00:46.53, Dirk's about driving me wild with that.
15,00:00:48.47,00:00:48.47,"When Christ came, He openedthe door to every human being."
16,00:00:51.60,00:00:51.60,   We've all sort of come to the conclusion
17,00:00:52.87,00:00:52.87, that Rudy really needs   to get out
18,00:00:54.30,00:00:54.30, of here-- he just criticizes  whatever we're doing.
19,00:00:56.60,00:00:56.60,"Come into the kitchen, ""Morning,   Rudy, how are you doing?"""
20,00:00:59.13,00:00:59.13,"""You're wasting your time out there."""
21,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00, JEFF:  And hunger set in.
22,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,   The oomph is a little gone.
23,00:01:03.83,00:01:03.83,I think that not eating  is a factor.
24,00:01:05.83,00:01:05.83,  ( laughs ): We want food.
25,00:01:07.63,00:01:07.63, JEFF:  Tagi Tribe gained advantage by winning a reward challenge.
26,00:01:11.40,00:01:11.40,   I wanted that maskand snorkel from day one
27,00:01:14.70,00:01:14.70, to go get fish.
28,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87,We got fish.
29,00:01:18.30,00:01:18.30,No way. No way!
30,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,( shrieking )
31,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,Watch the spear.
32,00:01:21.87,00:01:21.87, JEFF:  Pagong was forced   to look elsewhere for food.
33,00:01:24.73,00:01:24.73, JENNA:  I'm so ready to eat rat.
34,00:01:26.47,00:01:26.47," I want to gut 'em, bone 'em..."
35,00:01:27.70,00:01:27.70, JOEL:Surf 'n' turf. Minnows and rat.
36,00:01:30.33,00:01:30.33, GREG:  Rats aren't bad.
37,00:01:31.33,00:01:31.33, Rats are rats.
38,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,Questions of edibility only have  to do with your perceptions.
39,00:01:35.53,00:01:35.53,RAMONA:Please pass the rat.
40,00:01:40.83,00:01:40.83," JEFF: But Pagong rebounded bywinning the immunity challenge,"
41,00:01:44.17,00:01:44.17, and Tagi Tribe was sent backto Tribal Council in the middle
42,00:01:47.40,00:01:47.40, of a tropical storm.
43,00:01:49.17,00:01:49.17,STACEY: I thought Rudy would be
44,00:01:51.03,00:01:51.03,"   the next one off,  but it could be me."
45,00:01:52.80,00:01:52.80," RUDY: I'm going to vote Stacey out, 'cause I don't like her"
46,00:01:56.23,00:01:56.23,   and I never will.
47,00:01:57.60,00:01:57.60,"JEFF:Stacey. That's fourvotes, Stacey."
48,00:01:59.40,00:01:59.40,It's time for you to go.
49,00:02:01.90,00:02:01.90, 13 are left.
50,00:02:03.87,00:02:03.87," Who will be voted off   this week,"
51,00:02:05.83,00:02:05.83, and who will continue   to survive?

53,00:03:05.83,00:03:05.83,  ( thunder rumbling )
54,00:03:31.60,00:03:31.60,I'm not a happy camper.
55,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57,"GERVASE: It's cold, man."
56,00:03:35.20,00:03:35.20," It got cold and rained a lot,"
57,00:03:37.27,00:03:37.27,"  and everybody got, I mean..."
58,00:03:38.97,00:03:38.97,everybody was just wet.
59,00:03:42.70,00:03:42.70,"RAMONA:  It was long, wet and cold."
60,00:03:45.63,00:03:45.63, It was the worst night
61,00:03:49.63,00:03:49.63,I've ever slept.
62,00:03:53.67,00:03:53.67, GREG:  And worse trouble
63,00:03:55.30,00:03:55.30, was the bugs--   the bugs love it.
64,00:03:57.10,00:03:57.10," Once that rain comes, it's sand flea heaven."
65,00:03:59.73,00:03:59.73,   GRETCHEN: I have spent six years
66,00:04:02.67,00:04:02.67,  at the Air Force    survival school.
67,00:04:04.97,00:04:04.97,"  You know, we learned how   to make fires and shelters."
68,00:04:08.23,00:04:08.23,   Come on...
69,00:04:09.87,00:04:09.87,"  When we got here,"
70,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17," we argued over  where the shelter should be,"
71,00:04:13.47,00:04:13.47,"   and everything I've always been taught, you know,"
72,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"  you put it up off the beach,"
73,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77," you get canopy cover,"
74,00:04:19.27,00:04:19.27,"  which is your first layer of protection,"
75,00:04:21.40,00:04:21.40," but we made this huge shelter,    which was not comfortable"
76,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33, and it's not practical.
77,00:04:25.93,00:04:25.93,"  It's a rain forest,"
78,00:04:27.27,00:04:27.27,"so it was going to pour  one of these times,"
79,00:04:28.97,00:04:28.97," and it poured, and we got soaking wet,"
80,00:04:30.43,00:04:30.43,"  and I just thought,""This is ridiculous,"" you know."
81,00:04:32.50,00:04:32.50,"  And also, the gear is everywhere."
82,00:04:33.87,00:04:33.87, Our rice bucket's down there;the shovel's down there;
83,00:04:35.90,00:04:35.90,"we don't know, you know, wherethe parangs are in the morning,"
84,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,and... it's got to stop.
85,00:04:41.00,00:04:41.00,"   What's the reason   for that, though?"
86,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,It's not up-tide-- look.
87,00:04:45.07,00:04:45.07,The shovel is over there'cause we just dug...
88,00:04:46.83,00:04:46.83,"I know, but you're done digging,so the shovel..."
89,00:04:48.73,00:04:48.73,We don't know ifit's done yet.
90,00:04:50.83,00:04:50.83,   GRETCHEN: I think I am a little   frustrated with Joel today
91,00:04:52.70,00:04:52.70,"  because Joel wants  to take over,"
92,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,"and that's fine, but Joel doesn't know about..."
93,00:04:56.23,00:04:56.23,"where we're going to be the most comfortable,"
94,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57,"   and so, you know,  after last night, I thought,"
95,00:05:00.77,00:05:00.77,"""Well, I just can't let  this go on anymore."""
96,00:05:02.83,00:05:02.83," You want to vote me off, fine,  but we got to organize this."
97,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47," I don't want to sleep in that anymore, okay?"
98,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,You can sleep on thebeach if you want to.
99,00:05:10.00,00:05:10.00,I don't want to sleepon the beach anymore.
100,00:05:11.63,00:05:11.63," I don't want to be antisocial,  but I'm going in the woods."
101,00:05:15.00,00:05:15.00,Why don't we just go?Why don't we just start?
102,00:05:22.27,00:05:22.27,We get to move--it's so exciting
103,00:05:23.93,00:05:23.93,when you get to moveto a new place.
104,00:05:25.47,00:05:25.47,"Oh, man, it's hot."
105,00:05:38.30,00:05:38.30,"   GRETCHEN:  If this were, right now,  each man for himself,"
106,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,  Greg would be the victor.
107,00:05:42.00,00:05:42.00, He's relaxed.
108,00:05:43.40,00:05:43.40,He's not fighting this.
109,00:05:44.67,00:05:44.67,It's not like a battle for him.
110,00:05:46.57,00:05:46.57,"Greg's a character, man."
111,00:05:47.97,00:05:47.97,   Hold on one second. Yeah?
112,00:05:49.53,00:05:49.53,   Greg talks into a coconut   and thinks it's a phone.
113,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37, This guy wants   to do an interview
114,00:05:53.70,00:05:53.70,   for four or five minutes.
115,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27, GREG:The naturephone is really a way
116,00:05:57.77,00:05:57.77,"  that I kind of keep in touchwith the greater, um..."
117,00:05:59.93,00:05:59.93,  the greater spirit out here.
118,00:06:02.27,00:06:02.27,"All right, listen, well,  uh, yeah, just hold my calls"
119,00:06:05.20,00:06:05.20,"  if, uh, anybody's in this..."
120,00:06:06.70,00:06:06.70, You get reception everywhere.
121,00:06:08.93,00:06:08.93,  You're always incommunicado
122,00:06:11.10,00:06:11.10,"with everything and anyone, and, uh..."
123,00:06:13.10,00:06:13.10," you know, it's light, it's quick, it's easy,"
124,00:06:15.33,00:06:15.33,and it's relatively inexpensive.
125,00:06:17.30,00:06:17.30,Do you have a fittingfor bamboo?
126,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27,Okay.
127,00:06:20.33,00:06:20.33,"Yeah, yeah,as quickly as possible."
128,00:06:22.93,00:06:22.93,   GRETCHEN: Greg knows what he's doing--   he kind of
129,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17," manipulates the group,  and I think"
130,00:06:26.63,00:06:26.63,   a lot of people don't even realize it's going on.
131,00:06:28.13,00:06:28.13,"I think most of the people don't  even realize it's going on,"
132,00:06:30.57,00:06:30.57,"  but in his own way,  Greg's the leader."
133,00:06:32.73,00:06:32.73,"Okay. Yeah, yeah."
134,00:06:33.93,00:06:33.93,"Two min... Okay, bye."
135,00:06:35.27,00:06:35.27,Sorry about that.
136,00:06:36.50,00:06:36.50,Hit Greg in the head.
137,00:06:46.80,00:06:46.80," SEAN:  Sue, she just always keeps   working, working, working."
138,00:06:49.83,00:06:49.83,"  You know,it just drives everybody crazy."
139,00:06:51.70,00:06:51.70," I mean, the guys were talking   about that today."
140,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,   I wish she would slow downfor a little bit and just relax.
141,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27, SUSAN:  We're getting by  on coconut and rice.
142,00:06:59.53,00:06:59.53,"  You know, whatever we can gather,"
143,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,  and we're still not done  looking for tapioca or nuts.
144,00:07:03.57,00:07:03.57,Tapioca.
145,00:07:05.10,00:07:05.10,   Tapioca's supposed   to have red lines.
146,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,Got to find the tapioca.
147,00:07:08.27,00:07:08.27," SEAN:  I had this vision,"
148,00:07:09.77,00:07:09.77," and, uh, I thought I'd  build myself a bowling alley"
149,00:07:12.50,00:07:12.50,   right about here.
150,00:07:14.10,00:07:14.10,"  That's what I'm doing here, slaving away."
151,00:07:16.40,00:07:16.40,  ( Susan grunts with effort )
152,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50, This little...
153,00:07:22.93,00:07:22.93," Aw, this is all woody."
154,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,"  What I think I might do is,"
155,00:07:26.20,00:07:26.20,  I might take some of those coconuts
156,00:07:27.50,00:07:27.50,  over there-- that are lined up like that--
157,00:07:29.60,00:07:29.60,I might take that bamboo   over there
158,00:07:30.93,00:07:30.93," and make, like, a little shelf"
159,00:07:32.60,00:07:32.60,  where you can have the extra  balls hanging out up there?
160,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,"No, that's a stalk."
161,00:07:38.37,00:07:38.37,"Oh, is that...that's those big nuts."
162,00:07:41.80,00:07:41.80,   Sean's telling me looking  for nuts is a waste of time.
163,00:07:44.63,00:07:44.63, But at least you know  you can find a nut.
164,00:07:46.67,00:07:46.67, Sean sits there for five hours and builds his bowling alley.
165,00:07:49.77,00:07:49.77,  He could've been   all getting nuts or looking
166,00:07:52.50,00:07:52.50,  for tapioca during the day.
167,00:07:54.10,00:07:54.10,  I'm tired of feeding peoplethat don't do anything.
168,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17," If we lose tomorrow,  I'm voting Sean off."
169,00:07:58.27,00:07:58.27, My parents would be so proud.
170,00:08:05.20,00:08:05.20," Throughout their time on the island,"
171,00:08:07.30,00:08:07.30,the tribes will compete   in a series of challenges.
172,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,They'll receive messages
173,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,notifying them of these   competitions at tree mail.
174,00:08:16.40,00:08:16.40, Today's mail   informs both tribes
175,00:08:18.13,00:08:18.13,  about their next    reward challenge
176,00:08:19.87,00:08:19.87,"  called ""Distress Signal."""
177,00:08:21.73,00:08:21.73,"Hey, you guys!"
178,00:08:23.77,00:08:23.77, JEFF: They'll build an S.O.S.  on their respective beaches.
179,00:08:27.03,00:08:27.03, A plane flying overhead
180,00:08:28.57,00:08:28.57,  will determine whose signal  is the most creative
181,00:08:31.23,00:08:31.23,  and parachute in    a crate full of supplies.
182,00:08:33.40,00:08:33.40,  Both tribes  have been instructed
183,00:08:35.47,00:08:35.47,  to send a representative
184,00:08:37.57,00:08:37.57, to see the creature comforts    they'll be competing for.
185,00:08:39.83,00:08:39.83,We've got a nice luxurygoing on-- whoa!
186,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60," JEFF: Things like hammocks,   towels and pillows."
187,00:08:46.60,00:08:46.60,"  Oh, my God!"
188,00:08:48.33,00:08:48.33, JEFF:  But Jenna and Dirk   have each requested
189,00:08:50.43,00:08:50.43,  one additional item    be placed into the crate.
190,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90," We want a spice rack,"
191,00:08:54.03,00:08:54.03,"including salt, pepper,garlic, soy sauce..."
192,00:08:56.53,00:08:56.53,Then you would havea full-out competitionfor that spice rack.
193,00:08:59.77,00:08:59.77,  What would make it  worthwhile for you?
194,00:09:01.43,00:09:01.43,We need aflay knife.
195,00:09:02.50,00:09:02.50,JEFF:Here's the deal-- two clues
196,00:09:04.40,00:09:04.40,for tomorrow's challenge.
197,00:09:05.77,00:09:05.77,"Do me a favor, though."

280,00:11:40.00,00:11:40.00,  that maybe were a little bittasteless or...
281,00:11:41.83,00:11:41.83,"you know, and don't have much class, you know?"
282,00:11:43.67,00:11:43.67,"  I believe that class kind ofshows itself, and things like..."

289,00:11:55.40,00:11:55.40,   That's not very creative.
290,00:11:56.90,00:11:56.90,  That's just looking   in a bathroom stall wall.

295,00:12:06.23,00:12:06.23,That's an idea;that's an idea.
296,00:12:08.37,00:12:08.37, I don't think we can do it together
297,00:12:09.87,00:12:09.87,  without the things floating  all discombobulated.
298,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,"   Yay, Mr. Positive.   All right."
299,00:12:13.97,00:12:13.97,RICHARD:  An idea comes up and you    can see on people's faces

301,00:12:18.37,00:12:18.37,and then they'll just harp on it and make it...
302,00:12:21.27,00:12:21.27,   want it even more.
303,00:12:23.13,00:12:23.13,SEAN:I just thinkthat we need
304,00:12:24.23,00:12:24.23,to do something simplebut extravagant.
305,00:12:25.80,00:12:25.80, Like one thing  that we all work on.
306,00:12:27.57,00:12:27.57," You know, similar to, like...  like the Rose Bowl."
307,00:12:30.17,00:12:30.17," SEAN:  I just wish people would,  you know, see things my way,"
308,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,"  in terms of,  I think that what they want"
309,00:12:34.70,00:12:34.70,"is something really spectacular,"
310,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40, and I think that we could work   through the night and build
311,00:12:38.23,00:12:38.23, something really spectacular
312,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77, that would ensure us  getting that crate.
313,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,"What's happening in my head is,  ""Here's the conflict."

317,00:12:50.03,00:12:50.03,You talk aboutdoing a float

319,00:12:52.77,00:12:52.77,"Not a float,a project."
320,00:12:54.83,00:12:54.83,"   I know, a project."

325,00:13:02.03,00:13:02.03,"Well, I know what the resolutionto the conflict"
326,00:13:05.20,00:13:05.20," that exists right now   would be at home,"
327,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,   but I'm actually planning something different from that
328,00:13:10.67,00:13:10.67," that might benefit me,   and it's a little sneaky."
329,00:13:13.40,00:13:13.40, ( chuckling )
330,00:13:14.83,00:13:14.83, I think    I'm going to handle this
331,00:13:16.50,00:13:16.50, by beginning  to develop alliances
332,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23, with some folks
333,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00, to ensure that I move into the next round.
334,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,   That means we needto clean up that beach.
335,00:13:40.57,00:13:40.57, JENNA: I don't think Ramona's   pulling her weight.
336,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,"I think that she really thought she could handle this,"
337,00:13:44.97,00:13:44.97, and now she's finding   that I don't think she...
338,00:13:47.00,00:13:47.00,she can as much as she thought.
339,00:13:49.37,00:13:49.37,  Ugh.
340,00:13:50.90,00:13:50.90," Yesterday was bad, bad night."
341,00:13:53.70,00:13:53.70, The only thing   Ramona can be is herself.
342,00:13:56.47,00:13:56.47,   I'm a mama's girl.
343,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67,"   Well, I'm mama's   only child, so..."
344,00:14:02.07,00:14:02.07, She has great gifts to offer.
345,00:14:04.40,00:14:04.40,   Maybe she will be able to.
346,00:14:06.37,00:14:06.37,Maybe she won't.
347,00:14:07.63,00:14:07.63,"But I can't do any more than I can do,"
348,00:14:11.23,00:14:11.23,and I'm not going to tryand bust my ass
349,00:14:12.90,00:14:12.90,  and try and prove something.

494,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50, KELLY:  Because the more people you   know that are going to vote

502,00:21:51.90,00:21:51.90,We really could control our fate

505,00:21:58.33,00:21:58.33, there'll be alliances.

516,00:22:15.73,00:22:15.73, RUDY:  Somebody said that
517,00:22:17.27,00:22:17.27," if you want to sort of gang up    against somebody,"
518,00:22:20.53,00:22:20.53,  you ought to talk about it
519,00:22:22.40,00:22:22.40,"  to get rid of them, but, uh,I don't agree with that,"
520,00:22:25.40,00:22:25.40,  so I'm not doing it.
521,00:22:26.80,00:22:26.80,  I don't knowabout the rest of them.

525,00:22:33.37,00:22:33.37,can work togetherreally well.
526,00:22:34.63,00:22:34.63, I trust you completely.
527,00:22:34.63,00:22:34.63,Yeah.
528,00:22:36.40,00:22:36.40,"RICHARD: I think we can trust the three of our votes,"
529,00:22:38.57,00:22:38.57," 'cause if one of us blows up,  trustworthiness-wise,"
530,00:22:42.00,00:22:42.00,then this whole thing's out the window
531,00:22:43.83,00:22:43.83,and it's... it's a free-for-all.

548,00:23:26.57,00:23:26.57," She feels like she's more part of the group,"
549,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83, which I don't think she felt in the very beginning.
550,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,I'll help you with thatin a second.
551,00:23:32.10,00:23:32.10,   I'm almost done with this.

554,00:23:38.83,00:23:38.83,GERVASE: Looks like she's turned things around.

557,00:23:45.50,00:23:45.50,  totally different.
558,00:23:47.63,00:23:47.63,   I think Ramona has changed

561,00:23:52.60,00:23:52.60, But I don't think her attitude    has changed much.

563,00:23:57.90,00:23:57.90, but I think maybe it is
564,00:23:59.53,00:23:59.53, a little too little too late.

600,00:25:54.10,00:25:54.10,and do whatever we think   we should.
601,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80,GERVASE:  We'll win.
602,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80,  Both.
603,00:25:57.50,00:25:57.50,"  It might be close, but we'll definitely win today."
604,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,Without a doubt.
605,00:26:08.67,00:26:08.67, We got to winthis immunity challenge.
606,00:26:10.80,00:26:10.80,  We got to stomp them so bad.
607,00:26:13.13,00:26:13.13,"We're excited for the challenge,   we feel confident,"
608,00:26:15.47,00:26:15.47,  and we feel ready.
609,00:26:16.87,00:26:16.87," JOEL:  Yeah, this is a big one,"
610,00:26:19.23,00:26:19.23,   and this is huge.
611,00:26:20.63,00:26:20.63,"  Um, you know, yeah,we don't want to lose this one."
612,00:26:23.10,00:26:23.10," We're here to compete,"
613,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60," and we're here   to win these competitions,"
614,00:26:26.63,00:26:26.63,   and we're here to do them   as a team.
615,00:26:28.40,00:26:28.40, I wouldn't say   we're-we're cocky.
616,00:26:30.37,00:26:30.37,"I just think that we're,  uh, we're the best."
617,00:26:39.70,00:26:39.70," Welcome, guys."
618,00:26:39.70,00:26:39.70,Hey.
619,00:26:42.10,00:26:42.10,  I'll take the idol--back up for grabs today.
620,00:26:44.57,00:26:44.57,Welcome to Asmara Beach.
621,00:26:47.43,00:26:47.43,"  It's a relay today,   so the sum"
622,00:26:49.30,00:26:49.30, of all   of your individual efforts
623,00:26:51.60,00:26:51.60, will determinewho wins and who loses.
624,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27, If one person completely falls down
625,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,   their team could crumble-- they may end up paying
626,00:26:58.07,00:26:58.07,   for those actions tonight at the Tribal Council.
627,00:27:00.97,00:27:00.97,"  Colleen, come on up. Who's your..."
628,00:27:02.60,00:27:02.60,"  Sean. Okay, you guys come up here,"
629,00:27:04.47,00:27:04.47, and I'll explain thisusing this map.
630,00:27:06.67,00:27:06.67,  There are five legs in the relay.
631,00:27:08.77,00:27:08.77,   The first leg is the swim.
632,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,   You'll start here   and head for these buoys.
633,00:27:13.10,00:27:13.10," Directly underneath isa bottle, which contains a map."
634,00:27:16.47,00:27:16.47, Grab the bottle
635,00:27:17.83,00:27:17.83,  and pass it to one of your tribe members.
636,00:27:20.30,00:27:20.30,"  For the second leg,"
637,00:27:21.73,00:27:21.73, you'll run the bottle  across this floating bridge
638,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73, into an awaiting boat.
639,00:27:25.77,00:27:25.77,"  The third leg is the paddle,  where you'll head for shore"
640,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,and hand the bottle off.
641,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63, Inside of it is a map
642,00:27:31.07,00:27:31.07,showing the destinations for the remaining two events.
643,00:27:33.93,00:27:33.93,   The fourth leg is   a sprint into the jungle.
644,00:27:36.30,00:27:36.30,"   Using the map, the runner   will find a rope ladder."
645,00:27:39.07,00:27:39.07,"  Climb up it, and you'll grab a key."
646,00:27:40.93,00:27:40.93,"  For the fifth and final leg,"
647,00:27:42.43,00:27:42.43, two members of your tribe willlocate the buried treasure chest
648,00:27:45.40,00:27:45.40, and dig it up.
649,00:27:46.90,00:27:46.90,The first team to get your chest   back on your crate
650,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,with the key in the lock
651,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17, wins immunity.

655,00:27:56.43,00:27:56.43, thermometer's topping  100 degrees.
656,00:27:57.57,00:27:57.57,This is for immunity.
657,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,Whoo!

726,00:32:19.10,00:32:19.10,We did our best.
727,00:32:20.40,00:32:20.40,That's not good enough.
728,00:32:21.63,00:32:21.63,The idol.
729,00:32:22.63,00:32:22.63,"SUSAN:Oh, yeah!"
730,00:32:26.50,00:32:26.50,"JEFF:Tagi, nice job."
731,00:32:27.60,00:32:27.60,   Nice job.
732,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,"WOMAN:Good job, you guys."
733,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17," Pagong, I'll see you tonight--Tribal Council."
734,00:33:29.57,00:33:29.57,GERVASE:  The most difficult thing   of this whole thing for me
735,00:33:32.87,00:33:32.87,is to vote somebody off.
736,00:33:34.27,00:33:34.27,  I think we're dreading that.
737,00:33:35.97,00:33:35.97, JENNA: Going to this island council meeting tonight
738,00:33:38.47,00:33:38.47,  it's really tough.
739,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,  The thought of eliminating   any of these people
740,00:33:42.33,00:33:42.33,"   that we're placing   all of our confidence in,"
741,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,  it's getting worse.
742,00:33:46.10,00:33:46.10,I can't imagine   and I can't fathom
743,00:33:48.43,00:33:48.43,  voting off somebodyfrom this team tonight.
744,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"I'm going, not knowingwhat's going to happen,"
745,00:34:03.57,00:34:03.57,and I'm nervous.
746,00:34:04.87,00:34:04.87,I wish I started slower.
747,00:34:06.50,00:34:06.50,And then I wishit wasn't so far.
748,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,I'm nervous about votesbeing against me tonight
749,00:34:11.30,00:34:11.30, because of...
750,00:34:13.10,00:34:13.10,  I'm not a champion  in the competition.
751,00:34:17.53,00:34:17.53,"  Speed-wise,we got right down there."
752,00:34:19.70,00:34:19.70,"   We got right down to the treasure chest,"
753,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,"and it just kept collapsing in,   and it was so devastating."
754,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,  All day I had this feeling  that my leg would be the one
755,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,"  that would lose it for us,   and it did."
756,00:34:28.67,00:34:28.67,"It does make me feel vulnerable,   um, for the vote tonight."
757,00:34:36.33,00:34:36.33,"GERVASE:If somebody had to go right now  in our tribe,"
758,00:34:39.20,00:34:39.20," I would vote for Jenna,"
759,00:34:40.63,00:34:40.63,  because she's more annoying  than Colleen.
760,00:34:43.10,00:34:43.10,"I could deal with Jennanot being here,"
761,00:34:44.73,00:34:44.73, then just keep Colleen arounda little longer.
762,00:34:47.13,00:34:47.13,"   We're all friends,   and then you boot someone."
763,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,It's like the board game Sorry.
764,00:34:52.23,00:34:52.23, You pick the card and you got to take your thing and smash
765,00:34:55.53,00:34:55.53, the other guy out of the way.
766,00:34:57.60,00:34:57.60,"  Knock 'em out, that's that,  you move on."
767,00:34:59.53,00:34:59.53, Sor-r-r-r-ry!
768,00:35:14.90,00:35:14.90,"This is Tribal Council,"
769,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,"  where each week, one member will be voted off the island."
770,00:35:20.67,00:35:20.67,"  The last time Pagong went   to Tribal Council,"
771,00:35:23.30,00:35:23.30, Ramona got three votes.
772,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77, Is she still at risk?
773,00:35:27.37,00:35:27.37,nWill Gervase's weakperformances
774,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83, in the last several challenges    cost him?
775,00:35:32.60,00:35:32.60, Or will it be someone nobody expects?
776,00:35:58.77,00:35:58.77, ( gong tolls )
777,00:36:28.63,00:36:28.63,   Go ahead and take a seat.
778,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"So here we are again...   with the unpleasant task,"
779,00:36:39.73,00:36:39.73, yet you actually have a very tough mandate.
780,00:36:42.23,00:36:42.23,You have to vote one
781,00:36:43.93,00:36:43.93,of your tribe membersoff the island tonight.
782,00:36:46.50,00:36:46.50,And I think whatmakes it equally hard
783,00:36:48.10,00:36:48.10,"is that in doing so,you're sort of forced"
784,00:36:50.57,00:36:50.57,to hold a mirror upto yourselves.
785,00:36:52.37,00:36:52.37,"Ramona, what criteriado you use"
786,00:36:55.50,00:36:55.50,in determining who you're goingto vote off the island?
787,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,   Everything is so dynamic.
788,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,"   I mean, I could have been"
789,00:37:02.90,00:37:02.90,  thinking one person   when we left camp
790,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,and have   a totally different person
791,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00," in my mind now, so..."
792,00:37:08.57,00:37:08.57," I mean, nobody, like, totally sucks, so..."
793,00:37:10.90,00:37:10.90,"it's like, mmm,at this point,"
794,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,"I mean, we all like each other,  so it's not like..."
795,00:37:17.70,00:37:17.70,"I mean, it would almost even be easier"
796,00:37:20.10,00:37:20.10,"  if we didn't like each other  and I was like, ""I hate you!"
797,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,"  You're outta here!"""
798,00:37:24.87,00:37:24.87, But we like each other
799,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23,"so it's like,I don't know."
800,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,"   I mean, it's how you feel  at that time"
801,00:37:30.23,00:37:30.23,"when you go up to writetheir name, it's like..."

803,00:37:34.20,00:37:34.20,"  And you want to keep the team strong, so..."
804,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,that's probably the main thing.
805,00:37:39.03,00:37:39.03,Anybody feel
806,00:37:40.50,00:37:40.50,confident enoughthat they want to own up

811,00:37:54.93,00:37:54.93,I'll be around.
812,00:37:56.40,00:37:56.40,  I'm looking to hang  till the final four.
813,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,"Well, it's interestingthat you say that,"
814,00:38:02.23,00:38:02.23,"because for the lastthree challenges,"
815,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,you were somewhatresponsible foryour tribe's loss.
816,00:38:06.70,00:38:06.70,"Bugging out with thosebugs, in from the deep,"
817,00:38:08.93,00:38:08.93,swimming-- for somebody
818,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,"  who's still really learning  how to swim,"
819,00:38:12.43,00:38:12.43,  you took that on heartily--
820,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,"and then today,I think it saysa lot about you"
821,00:38:16.60,00:38:16.60,that you still feelthat confident
822,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,that you aren'tgoing anywhere.
823,00:38:20.07,00:38:20.07, Nah. I feel quite comfortable in my position on this island.
824,00:38:24.60,00:38:24.60,  Okay. Anybody want to own up
825,00:38:26.53,00:38:26.53,to feelingvulnerable tonight?
826,00:38:32.43,00:38:32.43,  ( laughter )
827,00:38:36.17,00:38:36.17," I think I may have just playedmyself out on the last question,"
828,00:38:41.97,00:38:41.97,"so I'm feeling quite vulnerable   right now,"
829,00:38:44.60,00:38:44.60,"  but, I mean, I'll be back tomorrow."
830,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,  ( laughter )
831,00:38:47.70,00:38:47.70,"Jenna, you're going"
832,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,"to walk over there, you're going  to pick up that pen,"
833,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,   you're going to write downa name.
834,00:38:53.00,00:38:53.00,"   Is it going to feel good,"
835,00:38:54.20,00:38:54.20,or is it goingto feel bad?
836,00:38:56.40,00:38:56.40, I feel guilty.
837,00:38:57.97,00:38:57.97,  I feel bad.
838,00:38:59.77,00:38:59.77,Why do you feel guilty?
839,00:39:01.37,00:39:01.37,"Well, I mean, I'm going to have  to put somebody's name down"
840,00:39:03.97,00:39:03.97, that I really respect and have come to really like.
841,00:39:06.23,00:39:06.23,It's like takinga piece of ourfamily away.
842,00:39:08.83,00:39:08.83,   You may say that it   may strengthen the   team because you take
843,00:39:10.73,00:39:10.73,"the weakest link,but I don't think so,"
844,00:39:12.13,00:39:12.13,because we're so strongright now.
845,00:39:13.83,00:39:13.83,   You take one of us away--   I don't care who it is--
846,00:39:15.83,00:39:15.83, and you've got a weaker tribe.
847,00:39:17.53,00:39:17.53,   All right. It's time to vote.
848,00:39:20.70,00:39:20.70,Gervase.
849,00:39:43.77,00:39:43.77,My vote is for Colleen.
850,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70," We don't know what lies ahead right now, but we're hurting."
851,00:39:49.23,00:39:49.23,   So I think we need to stay as strong as possible.
852,00:39:51.93,00:39:51.93,"I mean, I love the girlto death, but..."
853,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37," somebody's got to go, so it's got to be for Colleen."
854,00:40:21.87,00:40:21.87,   Self-fulfilling prophecy.
855,00:40:24.47,00:40:24.47,  It seems time to go.
856,00:40:37.77,00:40:37.77,  No comment.
857,00:40:50.10,00:40:50.10," Because even though she tried   to redeem herself,"
858,00:40:53.77,00:40:53.77," a little too little, too late."
859,00:41:05.03,00:41:05.03,"Before I read the votes,"
860,00:41:06.67,00:41:06.67,"I just want to remind youthat, once they're tallied,"
861,00:41:09.27,00:41:09.27,"the decision is final,and the person"
862,00:41:11.13,00:41:11.13,will need to leavethe island immediately.

864,00:41:15.87,00:41:15.87,and about 200 feet down   is a confessional.

866,00:41:21.70,00:41:21.70,  Sound good?
