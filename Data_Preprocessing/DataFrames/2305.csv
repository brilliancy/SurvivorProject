441,00:13:25.10,00:13:25.10,YES.
442,00:13:25.77,00:13:25.77,I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD
443,00:13:27.30,00:13:27.30,GO FOR WEAK BUT THEY'RE GOING
444,00:13:28.33,00:13:28.33,FOR TEAM COACH.
445,00:13:29.63,00:13:29.63,ANYBODY WHO WASN'T WITH COACH IS
446,00:13:30.87,00:13:30.87,GOING OUT.
447,00:13:31.53,00:13:31.53,COACH IS RUNNING THE SHOWY.
448,00:13:32.50,00:13:32.50,"ACTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM"
449,00:13:35.47,00:13:35.47,BENJAMIN.
450,00:13:36.03,00:13:36.03,"SHE'S LIKE, WATCH OUT."
451,00:13:37.27,00:13:37.27,"BENJAMIN IS IN CHARGE, ALBERT,"
452,00:13:39.37,00:13:39.37,SOPHIE.
453,00:13:39.83,00:13:39.83,IT'S NOT UNIFIED.
454,00:13:40.47,00:13:40.47,IT'S NOT--
455,00:13:41.73,00:13:41.73,YEAH.
456,00:13:43.27,00:13:43.27,BASICALLY THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIS
457,00:13:45.47,00:13:45.47,PUPPETS.
458,00:13:45.90,00:13:45.90,"COACH, ALBERT."
459,00:13:47.00,00:13:47.00,IF COACH IS STOCK MARKET
460,00:13:48.27,00:13:48.27,HE'LL GET RID OF ALBERT SOON.
461,00:13:49.80,00:13:49.80,I THINK ALBERT AND HE ARE
462,00:13:51.47,00:13:51.47,ALIGNED.
463,00:13:52.03,00:13:52.03,WHY WOULD HE GET RIDE OF
464,00:13:53.70,00:13:53.70,ALBERT?
465,00:13:54.47,00:13:54.47,IF THEY GET RID OF ALBERT--
466,00:13:55.67,00:13:55.67,BEFORE THE HERM.
467,00:13:56.73,00:13:56.73,OZZY MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE.
468,00:13:58.60,00:13:58.60,HE REVEALED IF HE WERE COACH HE
469,00:14:01.30,00:14:01.30,WOULD GET RID OF ALBERT.
470,00:14:02.93,00:14:02.93,THAT'S HUGE INFORMATION BECAUSE
471,00:14:03.97,00:14:03.97,IF OZZY IS SAYING COACH SHOULD
472,00:14:05.50,00:14:05.50,GET ONE OF THE STRONGER PEOPLE
473,00:14:07.10,00:14:07.10,"ON HIS TRIBE, THAT'S SAYING OZZY"
474,00:14:09.80,00:14:09.80,SHOULD GET RID OF ONE OF THE
475,00:14:11.07,00:14:11.07,STRONGER PEOPLE ON HIS SIDE.
476,00:14:12.87,00:14:12.87,THE TWO STRONG PEOPLE ARE ME AND
477,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37,KEITH.
478,00:14:14.93,00:14:14.93,"STAY HUMBLE, POSITIVE,"
479,00:14:16.33,00:14:16.33,UNIFIED.
480,00:14:16.93,00:14:16.93,"ONCE I HEARD THAT, I KNEW"
481,00:14:17.77,00:14:17.77,WHAT I HAD.
482,00:14:19.03,00:14:19.03,NOTHING SELLS LIKE FEAR.
483,00:14:20.10,00:14:20.10,I'M GOING TO PUT THAT FEAR IN
484,00:14:23.00,00:14:23.00,KEITH TELL HIM TO GET ELYSE GONE
485,00:14:25.87,00:14:25.87,NEXT.
486,00:14:36.33,00:14:36.33,THE DUEL WAS DEFINITELY
487,00:14:37.73,00:14:37.73,PAINFUL TO HEAR SOME OF THE
488,00:14:39.47,00:14:39.47,THINGS THAT WERE SAID-- NOT
489,00:14:40.20,00:14:40.20,PAINFUL PERSONALLY BUT PAINFUL
490,00:14:42.23,00:14:42.23,TOWARDS MY CAUSE.
491,00:14:44.43,00:14:44.43,DESPITE HOW STASE SENOT THE
492,00:14:45.67,00:14:45.67,SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED SHE

494,00:14:49.47,00:14:49.47,THINGS AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A
495,00:14:50.63,00:14:50.63,TARGET ON MY BACK ONCE WE GO TO
496,00:14:52.70,00:14:52.70,THE MERGE.
497,00:14:53.70,00:14:53.70,THEY'RE GOING TO TRY IT GET ME
498,00:14:54.80,00:14:54.80,OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE
499,00:14:56.07,00:14:56.07,ME AS A THREAT.
500,00:14:57.70,00:14:57.70,THAT CLUE IS STILL OUT THERE AND
501,00:14:58.93,00:14:58.93,THAT IDOL IS STILL OUT THERE.
502,00:15:01.07,00:15:01.07,I NEED TO FIND IT NOW.
503,00:15:08.90,00:15:08.90,THE CLUE!
504,00:15:16.23,00:15:16.23,GOOD STUFF RIGHT HERE.
505,00:15:19.97,00:15:19.97,"""IT'S DEFINITELY NEAR THE"
506,00:15:21.07,00:15:21.07,"JUNGLE, SOMEWHERE BY THE BEACH."
507,00:15:22.43,00:15:22.43,THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE
508,00:15:24.03,00:15:24.03,IS IT'S JUST BARELY OUT OF
509,00:15:27.17,00:15:27.17,REACH.
510,00:15:27.87,00:15:27.87,YOU COULD STAY DRY IF THE TIDE
511,00:15:28.53,00:15:28.53,"IS RIGHT, BUT YOU'LL NEED TO"
512,00:15:30.20,00:15:30.20,"CLIMB TO HAVE IDOL IN SIGHT."""
513,00:15:32.33,00:15:32.33,GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
514,00:15:39.43,00:15:39.43,THE CLUE KIND OF TOLD ME THE
515,00:15:40.47,00:15:40.47,LOCATION OF THE IDOL IS
516,00:15:42.90,00:15:42.90,"SOMEWHERE ON THE BEACH, WHERE"
517,00:15:44.40,00:15:44.40,"THE TIDE COMES IN KIND OF HIGH,"
518,00:15:45.80,00:15:45.80,AND IT'S SOMEWHERE UP OUT OF
519,00:15:47.67,00:15:47.67,REACH IN THE TREE.
520,00:15:48.43,00:15:48.43,"ONE BY ONE, I'M GOING TREE AFTER"
521,00:15:50.40,00:15:50.40,TREE AFTER TREE.
522,00:15:51.13,00:15:51.13,"THE MORE I'M LOOKING, I'M"
523,00:15:52.27,00:15:52.27,STARTING TO GET A LITTLE
524,00:15:53.90,00:15:53.90,FLUSTERED.
525,00:15:54.57,00:15:54.57,SO I FIGURED I CAN KILL TWO
526,00:15:56.00,00:15:56.00,BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.
527,00:15:57.17,00:15:57.17,I CAN KIND OF FURNISH GARNER
528,00:15:59.13,00:15:59.13,COACH AND SOPHIE'S TRUST BY

530,00:16:03.30,00:16:03.30,CAN ALSO HAVE THEM BE HELPERS
531,00:16:05.33,00:16:05.33,FOR ME TO FIND THE IDOL BECAUSE
532,00:16:06.90,00:16:06.90,FRANKLY I THINK I CAN'T DO THIS
533,00:16:08.30,00:16:08.30,BY MYSELF.
534,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,I FOUND A CLUE TO THE SECOND
535,00:16:12.53,00:16:12.53,"IDOL, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S IN A"
536,00:16:15.07,00:16:15.07,TREE.
537,00:16:15.43,00:16:15.43,IT'S HIGH.
538,00:16:16.00,00:16:16.00,AND IT'S BY THE BEACH.
539,00:16:18.97,00:16:18.97,I'M ONLY GOING TO TELL YOU TWO
540,00:16:20.43,00:16:20.43,BECAUSE I TRUST YOU TWO THE
541,00:16:21.93,00:16:21.93,MOST.
542,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60,THIS IS A HUGE GAME CHANGER.
543,00:16:23.30,00:16:23.30,"YEAH, IT IS HUGE."
544,00:16:26.03,00:16:26.03,ALBERT COULDN'T FIND THE HIDDEN
545,00:16:28.23,00:16:28.23,IMMUNITY IDOL BUT HE'S FOUND A

551,00:16:36.37,00:16:36.37,IT WILL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.
552,00:16:37.30,00:16:37.30,I CHECKED THIS TREE AND THIS
553,00:16:39.97,00:16:39.97,TREE.
554,00:16:40.67,00:16:40.67,I CHECKED TWO TREES OVER THERE
555,00:16:42.90,00:16:42.90,BUT I CAN'T FIND THE IDOL.
556,00:16:45.10,00:16:45.10,IT DEFINITELY SAID IN A TREE?
557,00:16:47.90,00:16:47.90,IT SAYS OUT OF REACH.
558,00:16:48.93,00:16:48.93,"YOU WANT TO DO A JOB RIGHT,"

943,00:30:21.17,00:30:21.17,IT'S COCHRAN.
944,00:30:22.07,00:30:22.07,OKAY.
945,00:30:24.20,00:30:24.20,OZZY'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE

953,00:30:39.47,00:30:39.47,OF ELYSE NEXT.
954,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,"RIGHT, ELYSE HAS TO GO."
955,00:30:42.77,00:30:42.77,SHE'S FINE WITH ELYSE FIRST.
956,00:30:45.03,00:30:45.03,"I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHO THE"

961,00:30:49.67,00:30:49.67,OKAY.
962,00:30:51.10,00:30:51.10,I FEEL LIKE I HAVE COCHRAN AND
963,00:30:52.60,00:30:52.60,"DAWN BUT IN A TRIBE OF SEVEN,"
964,00:30:54.07,00:30:54.07,YOU NEED FOUR.
965,00:30:54.77,00:30:54.77,I GOTTA FIND THAT FOURTH VOTE TO
966,00:30:56.93,00:30:56.93,GET ELYSE OUT.
967,00:30:58.63,00:30:58.63,I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT
968,00:31:00.23,00:31:00.23,SOMETHING THAT CAME UP THAT I
969,00:31:01.77,00:31:01.77,DIDN'T LIKE.
970,00:31:02.47,00:31:02.47,"SOMETHING KIND OF BIG, ACTUALLY."
971,00:31:06.10,00:31:06.10,IT RAISED MY EYEBROWS A LOT.
972,00:31:08.37,00:31:08.37,THE ONLY THING GOOD THAT CAME
973,00:31:10.27,00:31:10.27,OUT OF THE REDEMPTION ISLAND
974,00:31:11.33,00:31:11.33,INFORMATION IS I GOT A PIECE OF
975,00:31:12.87,00:31:12.87,FEAR THEY CAN PLANT IN KEITH TO
976,00:31:14.73,00:31:14.73,HELP HIM VOTE WITH ME AGAINST
977,00:31:17.03,00:31:17.03,ELYSE TONIGHT.
978,00:31:18.20,00:31:18.20,OZZY IS TALKING ABOUT COACH
979,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,NEEDS TO GET OUT ALBERT
980,00:31:21.50,00:31:21.50,BEFOREHAND.
981,00:31:22.23,00:31:22.23,"AND I'M LIKE-- SO, IMMEDIATELY,"
982,00:31:23.30,00:31:23.30,IF HE'S THINKING THAT COACH
983,00:31:24.67,00:31:24.67,"NEEDS TO GET OUT ALBERT, THAT"
984,00:31:26.47,00:31:26.47,MEANS HE'S THINKING HE NEEDS TO
985,00:31:28.03,00:31:28.03,GET OUT ONE OF US PREMERGE.
986,00:31:29.50,00:31:29.50,"AND I DON'T-- HERE'S THE THING,"
987,00:31:31.60,00:31:31.60,HE CAN'T DO IT-- LIKE COCHRAN IS
988,00:31:35.03,00:31:35.03,DRIVING ME FREAKING CRAZY.
989,00:31:35.60,00:31:35.60,"I KNOW,."
990,00:31:36.60,00:31:36.60,BUT IF WE GET RID OF ELYSE
991,00:31:39.23,00:31:39.23,"FIRST, HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING."
992,00:31:40.23,00:31:40.23,I KNOW.
993,00:31:40.97,00:31:40.97,I AGREE.
994,00:31:41.73,00:31:41.73,WE NEED ELYSE FIRST GONE.
995,00:31:43.07,00:31:43.07,KEITH AND I GET ON THE SAME
996,00:31:45.03,00:31:45.03,PAGE WITHIN ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
997,00:31:47.03,00:31:47.03,SO IT'S LOOKING PRETTY STRONGLY
998,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,LIKE ELYSE IS NEXT.
999,00:31:53.23,00:31:53.23,THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
1000,00:31:54.43,00:31:54.43,I DON'T THINK WE TELL OZZY.
1001,00:31:57.47,00:31:57.47,BUT THEN HE'S NOT GOING TO
1002,00:31:59.43,00:31:59.43,TRUST US.
1003,00:32:02.80,00:32:02.80,TONIGHT'S VOTE IS SUPPOSED TO GO
1004,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,"JIM, DAWN, COCHRAN, AND THEY"
1005,00:32:09.60,00:32:09.60,"VOTE ELYSE, AND THEN ELYSE AND"
1006,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,OZZY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR
1007,00:32:14.33,00:32:14.33,COCHRAN.
1008,00:32:15.03,00:32:15.03,SO THAT LEAVES ME AND WHITNEY
1009,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,FOR A LITTLE ROOM TO PLAY.
1010,00:32:18.10,00:32:18.10,WE GOTTA DO THAT.
1011,00:32:20.20,00:32:20.20,BECAUSE THEN WE CAN KIND OF DO
1012,00:32:22.30,00:32:22.30,WHATEVER WE WANT.
1013,00:32:23.00,00:32:23.00,THE FIRST ALLIANCE I MADE WAS
1014,00:32:24.27,00:32:24.27,"ME AND OZZY, SO TONIGHT'S VOTE"
1015,00:32:26.73,00:32:26.73,IS GOING TO BE REALLY SCARY
1016,00:32:28.23,00:32:28.23,"BECAUSE ELYSE GETS BLINDSIDED,"
1017,00:32:30.60,00:32:30.60,"IN A SENSE, OZZY GETS"
1018,00:32:33.70,00:32:33.70,BLINDSIDED.
1019,00:32:34.40,00:32:34.40,SO HOW IS OZZY GOING TO TRUST ME
1020,00:32:35.97,00:32:35.97,WHEN HE THINKS WE'RE ALL VOTING
1021,00:32:37.43,00:32:37.43,FOR COCHRAN?
1022,00:32:39.73,00:32:39.73,THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT I'M
1023,00:32:40.73,00:32:40.73,GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE
1024,00:32:42.77,00:32:42.77,OUT.
1025,00:32:44.60,00:32:44.60,"AND YOU'RE, LIKE, 100%"
1026,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,THINKING WE SHOULD GO WITH ELYSE
1027,00:32:48.37,00:32:48.37,NOW?
1028,00:32:48.93,00:32:48.93,"YES, NO, I DON'T KNOW."
1029,00:32:49.93,00:32:49.93,"YEAH, I JUST WANT TO MAKE"
1030,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67,SURE THAT WE'VE THOUGHT
1031,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,EVERYTHING THROUGH.
1032,00:32:54.37,00:32:54.37,ELYSE AND OZZY ARE LIKE THIS.
1033,00:32:57.00,00:32:57.00,AND I DON'T THINK OZZY'S GOING
1034,00:32:58.37,00:32:58.37,TO LIKE IT IF WE ALL VOTE HER
1035,00:33:00.80,00:33:00.80,"OFF, AND THERE GOES OUR"
1036,00:33:03.43,00:33:03.43,ALLIANCE.
1037,00:33:04.13,00:33:04.13,SO OZZY WANTS COCHRAN RIGHT
1038,00:33:08.03,00:33:08.03,NOW.
1039,00:33:08.70,00:33:08.70,WHAT ONE SO BAD IF WE VOTED
1040,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,COCHRAN OUT?
1041,00:33:10.13,00:33:10.13,I DON'T KNOW.
1042,00:33:11.13,00:33:11.13,SO IS IT BETTER TO GET ELYSE
1043,00:33:12.97,00:33:12.97,OUT NOW OR LATER?
1044,00:33:13.60,00:33:13.60,I DON'T KNOW.
1045,00:33:14.97,00:33:14.97,KEITH I ARE STILL TRYING TO
1046,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13,FIGURE OUT HOW TO WEASEL OUR WAY
1047,00:33:20.63,00:33:20.63,AROUND THIS AND STILL COME OUT
1048,00:33:23.20,00:33:23.20,IN OUR ALLIANCE WITH OZZY.
1049,00:33:26.10,00:33:26.10,IT'S HARD.
1050,00:33:27.03,00:33:27.03,I WISH WE COULD LET THOSE THREE
1051,00:33:29.33,00:33:29.33,VOTE FOR ELYSE AND US TWO VOTE
1052,00:33:31.43,00:33:31.43,"NOT COCHRAN, JUST SOMEONE ELSE."
1053,00:33:33.60,00:33:33.60,WE'RE ALL GOOD.
1054,00:33:34.80,00:33:34.80,ELYSE IS NEXT.
1055,00:33:35.77,00:33:35.77,REALLY?
1056,00:33:36.27,00:33:36.27,"YEAH, YEAH."
1057,00:33:38.10,00:33:38.10,SERIOUSLY?
1058,00:33:38.90,00:33:38.90,100%.
1059,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,REALLY?
1060,00:33:40.33,00:33:40.33,FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M NOT
1061,00:33:41.77,00:33:41.77,FEELING THAT BAD ABOUT MY
1062,00:33:43.03,00:33:43.03,CHANCES GOING INTO TONIGHT'S
1063,00:33:45.33,00:33:45.33,TRIBAL.
1064,00:33:46.10,00:33:46.10,"WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I GET SENT"
1065,00:33:47.47,00:33:47.47,TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
1066,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET
1067,00:33:50.43,00:33:50.43,SENT TO REDEMPTION.
1068,00:33:51.97,00:33:51.97,I DON'T THINK IF OZZY THINKS WE
1069,00:33:54.00,00:33:54.00,ARE ALL AGAINST HIM.
1070,00:33:56.10,00:33:56.10,WE ARE ALL AGAINST HIM.
1071,00:33:58.63,00:33:58.63,HE WILL BE AGAINST ME WHEN WE
1072,00:34:00.67,00:34:00.67,VOTE OUT HIS HAMMOCK SWEETHEART.

1115,00:35:20.30,00:35:20.30,CHALLENGES RUN SUCH A HUGE GAMUT
1116,00:35:22.50,00:35:22.50,OF THINGS.
1117,00:35:23.20,00:35:23.20,I THINK WE ALL DID A FANTASTIC
1118,00:35:24.73,00:35:24.73,JOB AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
1119,00:35:25.97,00:35:25.97,IT CAME DOWN TO TWO OUNCES.
1120,00:35:28.43,00:35:28.43,THAT MADE IT ESPECIALLY
1121,00:35:29.80,00:35:29.80,DEVASTATING.
1122,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,Jeff: TWO OUNCES IS ONE
1123,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,EXTRA WIGHT.

1125,00:35:34.03,00:35:34.03,OVER THINKING--

1127,00:35:36.60,00:35:36.60,BECAUSE WE ALL SAY WE GAVE 100%
1128,00:35:39.60,00:35:39.60,BUT THEN IT'S LIKE
1129,00:35:44.90,00:35:44.90,WOULDA-COULD-A-SHOULD-A.
1130,00:35:45.60,00:35:45.60,THIS WAS ONE WHERE IRONICALLY
1131,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,ENOUGH WE ALL HAD MORE INJURIES
1132,00:35:47.97,00:35:47.97,DURING THIS CHALLENGE THAN ANY
1133,00:35:49.97,00:35:49.97,OF OUR OTHER CHALLENGES
1134,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60,COMBINED.
1135,00:35:52.23,00:35:52.23,Jeff: GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.
1136,00:35:53.13,00:35:53.13,WHO HAS AN INJURY.
1137,00:35:54.30,00:35:54.30,FROM TODAY'S CHALLENGE?
1138,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,FROM TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1140,00:35:59.33,00:35:59.33,INJURY.
1141,00:35:59.97,00:35:59.97,I HAVE A BUN OF CUTS IN MY
1142,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,MOUTH.
1143,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,Jeff: ELYSE.
1144,00:36:05.63,00:36:05.63,CUTS.
1145,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,Jeff: DAWN.
1146,00:36:07.93,00:36:07.93,BROKEN TOOTH.
1147,00:36:10.73,00:36:10.73,Jeff: WHITNEY?
1148,00:36:11.87,00:36:11.87,JUST LIPS.
1149,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60,Jeff: COCHRAN.
1150,00:36:14.60,00:36:14.60,I HAVEN'T BEEN WEARING MY
1151,00:36:17.70,00:36:17.70,RETAINER AS A SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
1152,00:36:19.60,00:36:19.60,I DEFINITELY FELT MY TEETH
1153,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87,SHIFTING.
1154,00:36:21.43,00:36:21.43,"Jeff: COCHRAN, ARE YOU"
1155,00:36:22.13,00:36:22.13,BEING SILLY OR ARE YOU 100%
1156,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,SINCERE.
1157,00:36:27.60,00:36:27.60,I'M WARPING THE ARRANGEMENT
1158,00:36:28.60,00:36:28.60,OF MY TEETH.
1159,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,"Jeff: SMILE, LET ME SEE."
1160,00:36:30.27,00:36:30.27,THAT'S NOT A SMILE.
1161,00:36:31.37,00:36:31.37,"IT'S A GRIMACE, BUT..."
1162,00:36:33.23,00:36:33.23,"Jeff: DAWN, COCHRAN'S NEED"
1163,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,"TO ASSESS AND REASSESS, THAT'S"
1164,00:36:37.10,00:36:37.10,"NOT A SMILE, THAT'S A GRIMACE."
1165,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,HIGHWAY OFTEN IS THAT CHARMING
1166,00:36:40.43,00:36:40.43,AND HOW OFTEN IS IT ANNOYING?
1167,00:36:43.40,00:36:43.40,I THINK COCHRAN'S ENDEARING.
1168,00:36:45.27,00:36:45.27,HE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHARACTER
1169,00:36:46.60,00:36:46.60,"TO ME, BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO"
1170,00:36:48.30,00:36:48.30,A GAME ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE
1171,00:36:49.40,00:36:49.40,TOGETHER THAT WOULD NEVER BE
1172,00:36:50.97,00:36:50.97,TOGETHER.
1173,00:36:51.70,00:36:51.70,SO PART OF ME IS LEARNING TO BE
1174,00:36:53.23,00:36:53.23,REALLY TOLERANT.
1175,00:36:53.90,00:36:53.90,LIKE TODAY WHEN WE CAME BACK
1176,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00,"FROM THE CHALLENGE, HE SAID"
1177,00:36:56.10,00:36:56.10,THERE'S A POSSIBILITY WE COULD
1178,00:36:57.30,00:36:57.30,HAVE SOME COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
1179,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,BECAUSE WE ALL HAD OUR MOUTHS
1180,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,AGAINST THE SPIT.
1181,00:37:00.93,00:37:00.93,AND I JUST THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW
1182,00:37:02.73,00:37:02.73,WHERE YOU GET THAT.
1183,00:37:04.67,00:37:04.67,IT WAS JUST HILARIOUS BUT NOT.
1184,00:37:06.60,00:37:06.60,"Jeff: KEITH, EVERYBODY ELSE"
1185,00:37:08.63,00:37:08.63,WAS KIND OF LAUGHING.
1186,00:37:09.50,00:37:09.50,YOU HAD A DIFFERENT REACTION.
1187,00:37:10.70,00:37:10.70,"YEAH, IT WAS NASTY."
1188,00:37:12.80,00:37:12.80,I DON'T WANT A SUPPOSED DISEASE
1189,00:37:14.10,00:37:14.10,FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH.
1190,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,"YEAH, THE INTENTIONS WERE TO"
1191,00:37:17.33,00:37:17.33,"MAYBE MAKE EVERYONE LAUGH, BUT I"
1192,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"THINK IN THE END, YEAH, IT"
1193,00:37:21.13,00:37:21.13,GROSSED EVERYONE OUT.
1194,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,"Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU CAN'T"
1195,00:37:23.83,00:37:23.83,CATCH A BREAK.
1196,00:37:25.20,00:37:25.20,IT'S HORRIBLE.
1197,00:37:26.60,00:37:26.60,IT'S-- IT'S DEVASTATING.
1198,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,I KNOW THESE ARE KIND OF
1199,00:37:29.43,00:37:29.43,"LIGHT-HEARTED COMMENTS, BUT THEY"
1200,00:37:30.60,00:37:30.60,DO HURT.
1201,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,I MEAN TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ALWAYS
1202,00:37:33.83,00:37:33.83,LIKE NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO BE
1203,00:37:35.20,00:37:35.20,BETTER.
1204,00:37:35.93,00:37:35.93,I COULD OBSESS ABOUT EVERYTHING
1205,00:37:36.47,00:37:36.47,I DO OUT HERE--
1206,00:37:37.30,00:37:37.30,AND PROBABLY WILL TONIGHT.
1207,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,I PROBABLY WILL TONIGHT IF
1208,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,THERE IS A TONIGHT.
1209,00:37:41.30,00:37:41.30,"Jeff: ELYSE, CAN YOU FEEL"
1210,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,FOR SOMEBODY LIKE COCHRAN?
1211,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"OH, I CAN COMPLETELY FEEL FOR"
1212,00:37:46.17,00:37:46.17,COCHRAN.
1213,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD TO BE IN A
1214,00:37:48.03,00:37:48.03,POSITION WHERE PEOPLE ARE
1215,00:37:49.27,00:37:49.27,LOOKING AT YOU AND POINTING OUT

1244,00:38:28.73,00:38:28.73,ONE THING TO APPRECIATE ABOUT
1245,00:38:29.60,00:38:29.60,HIM IS THAT HE SO LOVES AND
1246,00:38:32.60,00:38:32.60,KNOWS THE GAME THAT WHETHER HE

1252,00:38:43.80,00:38:43.80,PERSONAL OR IS IT ABSOLUTELY
1253,00:38:45.73,00:38:45.73,STRATEGY?
