191,00:13:37.71,00:13:37.71,"I mean, we're fools in the senseof just saying, ""Okay, let's go"
192,00:13:41.25,00:13:41.25,"on staying strong,"" becausewe're going to have to face them"
193,00:13:43.71,00:13:43.71,"in the end.I mean, just, like, today I saw"
194,00:13:47.33,00:13:47.33,that.It was so blatant.
195,00:13:50.62,00:13:50.62,"You know, like, his whole bucketwas full, and none of us were"
196,00:13:53.04,00:13:53.04,"even close.Like, this is his element."
197,00:13:55.12,00:13:55.12,">> Yeah, I know.>> He's like... you can't beat"
198,00:13:57.08,00:13:57.08,him.The challenge today told me a
199,00:14:00.17,00:14:00.17,"lot in the sense of Ozzy reallylikes to win, and regardless of,"
200,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,"you know, if it's immunity orreward."
201,00:14:08.71,00:14:08.71,It's not even about that.It's not even about the prize at
202,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,the end.Ozzy just hates to lose.
203,00:14:18.04,00:14:18.04,>> You know what I mean?>> That's what I'm saying.
204,00:14:20.12,00:14:20.12,It wasn't even close forfirst place.
205,00:14:21.33,00:14:21.33,"You know, I can't risk the senseof him winning every immunity"
206,00:14:23.92,00:14:23.92,"challenge and every reward, andso that's just been lingering in"
207,00:14:27.08,00:14:27.08,"my head that, you know, he is abigger threat than I think"
208,00:14:29.21,00:14:29.21,people realize.>> I think at this point in the
209,00:14:51.33,00:14:51.33,"game, this is really frustratingfor me, because I'm on the"
210,00:14:56.12,00:14:56.12,outside and I don't know what todo.
211,00:14:58.33,00:14:58.33,I think the only thing that Ican do now is try pulling
212,00:15:00.58,00:15:00.58,someone over to my side andmaking them play a strategic
213,00:15:02.96,00:15:02.96,"game.And really, I mean, I think Ozzy"
214,00:15:06.12,00:15:06.12,"would be my only hope.>> Hi, how are you?"
215,00:15:21.29,00:15:21.29,>> Good.>> It's beautiful.
216,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,>> Hi!Thank you.
217,00:15:30.25,00:15:30.25,">> Yes, yes, yes.>> A good shower."
218,00:15:34.42,00:15:34.42,">> Oh, wow, beautiful!>> It's nice."
219,00:15:41.08,00:15:41.08,">> Oh, my god!>> Oh, god!"
220,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,"I will remember that shower,that one particular shower, for"
221,00:15:55.50,00:15:55.50,the rest of my life.Because it was hands-down the
222,00:15:59.25,00:15:59.25,best shower I've ever had.And that was just the beginning.
223,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,>> Have you had a massagebefore?
224,00:16:03.12,00:16:03.12,>> I've never had a massagebefore.
225,00:16:05.12,00:16:05.12,>> You've never had a massage?>> No.
226,00:16:07.08,00:16:07.08,">> Oh, you're in for a treat.We got a massage after that,"
227,00:16:09.79,00:16:09.79,which was awesome.It's a nice reminder of life
228,00:16:13.08,00:16:13.08,outside of this game.They're giving a hot rock
229,00:16:19.25,00:16:19.25,"massage, and they're massagingmy legs right now."
230,00:16:23.21,00:16:23.21,It feels great.>> It smells so good.
231,00:16:26.21,00:16:26.21,What is that smell?>> It's coconut.
232,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,">> Okay, there's a light at theend of the tunnel."
233,00:16:32.33,00:16:32.33,"All I have left is five days ofdirt, and I can do it."
234,00:16:35.21,00:16:35.21,I've gone 34 days.I can go five more.
235,00:16:57.46,00:16:57.46,>> This is the third time out onExile Island.
236,00:17:01.00,00:17:01.00,Third time's a charm.Except for the charm's not here
237,00:17:03.21,00:17:03.21,"anymore-- Yul's got it.So it hurts to be out here, not"
238,00:17:06.29,00:17:06.29,"being with Parvati, just tostrategize."
239,00:17:10.08,00:17:10.08,"Hopefully, Parvati can find someway to break up the old Aitutaki"
240,00:17:14.75,00:17:14.75,tribe.Who needs a fire when you can
241,00:17:20.17,00:17:20.17,"eat everything raw, right?I hope I can get some sleep, be"
242,00:17:24.38,00:17:24.38,nourished for the challenge thatI've got ahead of me.
243,00:17:39.92,00:17:39.92,It was awful.It was pouring down rain.
244,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33,"I just laid there, and shiveringand cold."
245,00:17:47.21,00:17:47.21,Not a good thing to go through.So I've got to keep fighting and
246,00:17:49.71,00:17:49.71,just put up with it for a littlebit longer.
247,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,>> I feel like its a fairy taleand I'm going to pinch myself
248,00:18:02.08,00:18:02.08,"and wake up in the sandy, grosstent."
249,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,">> Well, at least when we goback, there's only four more"
250,00:18:07.25,00:18:07.25,days.>> Kind of a big deal.
251,00:18:09.58,00:18:09.58,">> A really big deal.>> I mean, a lot of things can"
252,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,"happen.You're, like, in the same"
253,00:18:14.29,00:18:14.29,position that for a long time Ifelt like I was.
254,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,You have to win.Have to win.
255,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,">> Ozzy's kind of a loner, soit's hard to get to know him."
256,00:18:21.88,00:18:21.88,But he's opened up to me alittle bit.
257,00:18:24.25,00:18:24.25,"Oh, my god!So many different flavors."
258,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"Nothing tastes like coconut.The more charming I can be, the"
259,00:18:34.12,00:18:34.12,"more, like, friendly and in Ican get with these people,"
260,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,"especially Ozzy, the longer I'mgoing to stick around."
261,00:18:45.04,00:18:45.04,"Power outage?>> In the middle of dinner,"
262,00:18:49.42,00:18:49.42,"raging storm, and then all of asudden a blackout."
263,00:18:53.25,00:18:53.25,"We lit candles all over theplace, and it turned out to be"
264,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,"very beautiful ambiance.>> All of a sudden, this island"
265,00:19:09.21,00:19:09.21,band comes and sets up in themiddle of the living room.
266,00:19:11.79,00:19:11.79,"And then these dancers comerunning in, and they're all,"
267,00:19:14.33,00:19:14.33,"like, doing the native dancesand singing, and it was just"
268,00:19:17.92,00:19:17.92,"this huge island show.It was, like, way better than"
269,00:19:20.58,00:19:20.58,"dinner and a movie.After everything's done, like, I"
270,00:19:26.54,00:19:26.54,"have a little champagne and somewine in me, so we just took off"
271,00:19:30.79,00:19:30.79,our pajamas and hopped in thehot tub.
272,00:19:38.33,00:19:38.33,I'm nervous.I just peed in my pants and I
273,00:19:49.21,00:19:49.21,wasn't even wearing any.>> I don't know if Parvati is
274,00:19:52.58,00:19:52.58,flirting with Ozzy only becauseshe's hoping there might be some
275,00:19:56.50,00:19:56.50,"strategic option there.Ozzy, to some extent, might be"
276,00:19:59.79,00:19:59.79,"reciprocating.I mean, if Ozzy responds in some"
277,00:20:02.54,00:20:02.54,"way, maybe somewhere down theline, something might come up."
278,00:20:05.62,00:20:05.62,>> I've got two naked guys inthe hot tub.
279,00:20:10.04,00:20:10.04,>> Yeah.>> Yee-hah!
280,00:20:12.38,00:20:12.38,>> But the numbers are in myfavor at least this once.
281,00:20:16.33,00:20:16.33,">> I am looking out for myself.I mean, I've been playing this"
282,00:20:19.25,00:20:19.25,"game on an individual levelsince I got here, and I'm"
283,00:20:23.33,00:20:23.33,playing it now more than ever.So I might play the game with
284,00:20:26.12,00:20:26.12,Parvati while there's still theopportunity.
285,00:20:47.25,00:20:47.25,">> Camp life the last two dayshas been pretty relaxing, just"
286,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,basically Sundra and me.If there's one person I think I
287,00:20:53.58,00:20:53.58,"miss, probably it would be Yul,because I've been having some"
288,00:20:57.67,00:20:57.67,"thought about new strategy.You know, I would like to get"
289,00:21:01.12,00:21:01.12,Ozzy out sooner than later.>> We're back.
290,00:21:04.79,00:21:04.79,">> Hi.>> Hi, girls."
291,00:21:08.42,00:21:08.42,">> Hey, guys.>> How you doing?"
292,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,>> Good.>> It's okay.
293,00:21:15.29,00:21:15.29,"No, don't feel bad.>> I came back to camp, and I"
294,00:21:20.96,00:21:20.96,could tell something was alittle bit tense with Becky.
295,00:21:24.71,00:21:24.71,>> Some of the stuff that me andSundra have been talking about
296,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,was that we want to change upthe order.
297,00:21:32.42,00:21:32.42,>> Okay.So Becky took me out to the back
298,00:21:34.58,00:21:34.58,beach and we had a conversation.>> I know that we want the Aitu
299,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,"four to go forward as much aspossible, and everything."
300,00:21:41.00,00:21:41.00,But just seeing his bucketfull... he didn't win by a
301,00:21:43.58,00:21:43.58,"little bit.He beat us all, like, by a lot."
302,00:21:47.54,00:21:47.54,"He's a very strong competitor,whatever it is-- balance,"
303,00:21:50.08,00:21:50.08,endurance-- because he'splaying... he just loves to win.
304,00:21:53.58,00:21:53.58,>> I think any of us would havea hard time against Ozzy.
305,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,I would not be happy going tothe final two with Ozzy.
306,00:22:00.42,00:22:00.42,Any one of us going against Ozzywould be likely to lose on the
307,00:22:03.04,00:22:03.04,jury.Ozzy has been gaining a lot of
308,00:22:05.71,00:22:05.71,"favor with members of the oldRaro tribe, because they"
309,00:22:08.25,00:22:08.25,"perceive him as being, you know,kind of a pure player."
310,00:22:10.58,00:22:10.58,"He's doing his own thing.He's not strategizing, he's not"
311,00:22:13.08,00:22:13.08,building coalitions.He's playing a straight-up game
312,00:22:15.75,00:22:15.75,and he's doing a hell of a jobof it.
313,00:22:18.08,00:22:18.08,"Either we go to the final fourand take the high road, or we"
314,00:22:20.79,00:22:20.79,really play the game to thefinal end and we take steps to
315,00:22:25.88,00:22:25.88,ensure that both of us getthere.
316,00:22:39.71,00:22:39.71,>> Where's Parvati?>> There was always a concern
317,00:23:02.92,00:23:02.92,"that maybe Ozzy would go withwhomever has the best, you know,"
318,00:23:07.29,00:23:07.29,sell for him.So I think definitely Parvati is
319,00:23:11.00,00:23:11.00,a threat.>> Becky said that you think
320,00:23:13.21,00:23:13.21,Parvati is a threat.I think she's a huge threat.
321,00:23:15.08,00:23:15.08,I've been very surprised at howstrong she's been consistently
322,00:23:17.58,00:23:17.58,"in all of these challenges.At the same time, you know, we"
323,00:23:21.08,00:23:21.08,"might have to vote off Ozzy.>> You know, at this point, we"
324,00:23:26.71,00:23:26.71,"know that the other two Raromembers are desperate, so, you"
325,00:23:29.12,00:23:29.12,"know, it's just one more thingof ""Let's cover our bases, let's"
326,00:23:31.04,00:23:31.04,"cover our bases, let's cover ourbases."""
327,00:23:33.12,00:23:33.12,"We don't want any moresurprises, because it's getting"
328,00:23:35.25,00:23:35.25,"to that point.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
329,00:23:59.96,00:23:59.96,"We'll now bring in Adam,returning from Exile Island."
330,00:24:11.04,00:24:11.04,">> How you doing?Ah, you know."
331,00:24:13.29,00:24:13.29,">> How was last night?>> It was a little rough, a"
332,00:24:15.67,00:24:15.67,"little rough.>> Welcome back, welcome back."
333,00:24:17.83,00:24:17.83,">> But, you know, that's ExileIsland for you."
334,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,>> PROBST: You guys ready to getto today's immunity challenge?
335,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,>> Yeah.>> Yes.
336,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,">> PROBST: First things first.Ozzy, take back the necklace."
337,00:24:30.54,00:24:30.54,"Once again, immunity is back upfor grabs."
338,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,"For today's challenge, one at atime, you will carry four"
339,00:24:37.33,00:24:37.33,bundles of puzzle pieces acrossthe balance beams to your mat.
340,00:24:42.62,00:24:42.62,"Once you've collected all fourbundles, you will use those"
341,00:24:46.42,00:24:46.42,"bundles to create a table maze.Finally, you will use the maze"
342,00:24:51.12,00:24:51.12,to maneuver one cannonball pastdecoy holes into each of the two
343,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,corner pockets.First person to complete this
344,00:25:00.58,00:25:00.58,"wins immunity, guaranteed a onein five shot at winning this"
345,00:25:06.38,00:25:06.38,game.>> Yeah.
346,00:25:09.54,00:25:09.54,">> PROBST: We'll draw for spots,we'll get started."
347,00:25:14.25,00:25:14.25,"Here we go, for immunity.Survivors ready?"
348,00:25:17.79,00:25:17.79,Go!One bundle at a time across the

383,00:28:09.38,00:28:09.38,He's got to get one ball in eachof the two corner pockets.
384,00:28:13.21,00:28:13.21,Yul does not have his mazetogether correctly.
385,00:28:16.58,00:28:16.58,He's put a roadblock up forhimself.
386,00:28:19.83,00:28:19.83,Ozzy maneuvering it past one ofthe decoy holes.
387,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,Got to get around it.And he does.
388,00:28:27.08,00:28:27.08,Now he's got to get it into oneof the two side pockets.

399,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,you.Should be a very interesting
400,00:29:19.08,00:29:19.08,afternoon.See you at tribal.
401,00:29:46.42,00:29:46.42,">> Today Ozzy won immunity, asusual."
402,00:29:49.08,00:29:49.08,"I mean, he's just becoming abigger and bigger threat, so"
403,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,we're all pretty aligned onvoting out one of the Raro
404,00:29:54.04,00:29:54.04,"folks, either Adam or Parvati.It's just a question of who to"
405,00:29:56.96,00:29:56.96,vote out first.>> Yeah.
406,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,">> I'm not positive, but I don'tthink so."
407,00:30:07.38,00:30:07.38,>> Is it Parvati?>> I think it might be Parvati.
408,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,">> Obviously, I want her to stayaround but I know it's one of us"
409,00:30:12.04,00:30:12.04,"two.>> It's really a toss-up, but, I"
410,00:30:14.25,00:30:14.25,"mean, if you want to stay...>> I want to stay."
411,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,"If you could make that work,that would be awesome."
412,00:30:18.29,00:30:18.29,">> I like you a lot, and, like,I don't feel you deserved to go"
413,00:30:22.58,00:30:22.58,to Exile Island.It was real close.

415,00:30:27.38,00:30:27.38,">> Yul is definitely the puppetmaster here, and he acts like"
416,00:30:29.92,00:30:29.92,"it, too.He told me, ""If you want to stay"
417,00:30:32.38,00:30:32.38,"I'll take care of it.It's a done deal."""
418,00:30:34.58,00:30:34.58,>> I'm pretty sure I can make ithappen.

420,00:30:38.21,00:30:38.21,">> You're the man.My thinking is, as long as it's"
421,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,"benefiting me, I'm fine with it.You know, Parvati and I have"
422,00:30:46.88,00:30:46.88,"been together since thebeginning, and I want us both to"
423,00:30:50.50,00:30:50.50,"continue to be in this game.But if one of us has to go, you"
424,00:30:54.12,00:30:54.12,"know, I'd rather her than me.And then, when it's down to"
425,00:30:58.21,00:30:58.21,"five, I think my best shot is towin challenges."
426,00:31:08.04,00:31:08.04,">> I don't want to, like, pitmyself against Adam because, you"
427,00:31:12.17,00:31:12.17,"know, I care about him, and...but I know that it's one of us"
428,00:31:14.96,00:31:14.96,"tonight, you know?>> I think objectively you're"
429,00:31:17.62,00:31:17.62,"probably the bigger threatbetween and you Adam, mainly"
430,00:31:22.62,00:31:22.62,because you're very coordinated.So anything kind of requiring
431,00:31:25.04,00:31:25.04,that...>> Balance and agility?
432,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,">> Yeah, balance, agility.Like, I think... I mean, you're"
433,00:31:29.12,00:31:29.12,far more of a threat than Adamis.
434,00:31:31.58,00:31:31.58,"But because we have Ozzy, and tosome extent me, I'm less worried"
435,00:31:35.83,00:31:35.83,"about you as a threat.So for me, I actually see Adam"
436,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,"as being the bigger threat.Anyway, so that's what I'm"
437,00:31:42.67,00:31:42.67,thinking so you know where Ikind of stand.
438,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,">> I am hopeful, because Yulsays that he sees Adam as being"
439,00:31:48.96,00:31:48.96,the bigger threat right now.But I don't know how... I'm not
440,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,"going to bank on it at all.So, basically, I'm going to have"
441,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,to scramble something togetherand try to stay in this game
442,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"tonight.Who are you voting tonight,"
443,00:32:03.33,00:32:03.33,Adam?>> I don't know who I'm going to
444,00:32:06.29,00:32:06.29,"vote for, but I'm not going tovote for you or Ozzy."
445,00:32:09.62,00:32:09.62,"Either Becky, Sundra, or Yul.>> I just feel already my"
446,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17,"position is so precarious, thatif I do something like that, and"
447,00:32:41.04,00:32:41.04,"then I lost, then I'd definitelybe gone."
448,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,">> Yeah, but you'd be goneanyway when you lose, because"
449,00:32:46.88,00:32:46.88,you're such a threat.>> Yeah.
450,00:32:49.96,00:32:49.96,"I feel like I do dominate atthis point in the challenges,"
451,00:32:52.75,00:32:52.75,"but I am worried that Yul,Sundra, and Becky might kick me"
452,00:32:57.04,00:32:57.04,out in the future.So I'm just trying to cover all
453,00:33:01.42,00:33:01.42,the bases at this point and makesure that I've got more of an
454,00:33:06.21,00:33:06.21,edge later on in the game.So maybe Sundra might be the one
455,00:33:09.62,00:33:09.62,who's going tonight.>> He's in the shelter now.
456,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,>> All three?>> Yeah.
457,00:33:17.12,00:33:17.12,>> You think they're going totry to work over Ozzy?
458,00:33:20.62,00:33:20.62,And is there any chance theywould convince him to do
459,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,anything?>> Those three versus us three.
460,00:33:27.08,00:33:27.08,">> Oh!>> Are you worried, like..."
461,00:33:29.79,00:33:29.79,">> That Ozzy might be flipping?>> Right now, we noticed that"
462,00:33:33.38,00:33:33.38,Parvati and Adam were talking toOzzy inside the shelter by
463,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00,"themselves, so just to kind ofmitigate any possibility they"
464,00:33:40.79,00:33:40.79,might be trying to work Ozzyover and get an alliance going
465,00:33:43.33,00:33:43.33,"with them, I suggested that I orsomeone else go over and just"
466,00:33:47.46,00:33:47.46,sit in.Can I get in the shelter real
467,00:33:50.33,00:33:50.33,"quick?You know, I know you guys are"
468,00:33:55.25,00:33:55.25,"playing the game, but don't tryto get Ozzy against us."
469,00:33:57.71,00:33:57.71,>> I'm not trying to get him.He was sitting here with
470,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,"Parvati, and I've got to saysomething."
471,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33,">> I know.Okay, okay."
472,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,Do you understand?I can't sit here and just not
473,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,"say anything.>> Yeah, okay."
474,00:34:07.96,00:34:07.96,It makes me uneasy the way Yulreacted.
475,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,So maybe I was talking more thanI should have.
476,00:34:12.88,00:34:12.88,I... tonight I have the mostuneasy feeling.
477,00:34:17.21,00:34:17.21,"And, you know, I just think thatthe chances are greater that"
478,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,I'll be voted off.>> Do you think Jonathan would
479,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,get mad if I showed up wearingthe hat?
480,00:34:28.71,00:34:28.71,Do you think that he would getmad at that?
481,00:34:30.79,00:34:30.79,>> I don't know.You could try.
482,00:34:32.75,00:34:32.75,>> Do you think Jeff is going toyell at me?
483,00:34:34.54,00:34:34.54,"Jonathan, you know, he wantedhis hat, and I thought I would"
484,00:34:38.21,00:34:38.21,"give it to him.You know, if I got voted out and"
485,00:34:41.12,00:34:41.12,it and I left something thatmeant a lot to me here and I
486,00:34:43.00,00:34:43.00,"just asked someone to give it tome, I'd expect them to do it."
487,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"I just feel like it's, like, anice thing to do."
488,00:34:47.08,00:34:47.08,">> Let's call you ""Yonathan."">> Yulathan."
489,00:34:51.62,00:34:51.62,>> Yulathan.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
490,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,"the members of the jury.Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,"
491,00:35:20.62,00:35:20.62,"Candice, and Jonathan, voted outat the last tribal council."
492,00:35:31.21,00:35:31.21,"Well, normally, the jury doesn'thave any involvement other than"
493,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,"listening, but Yul brought yourhat, Jonathan."
494,00:35:37.29,00:35:37.29,>> I see.Thank you very much.
495,00:35:39.46,00:35:39.46,>> PROBST: Quite possibly theboldest move I've seen yet from
496,00:35:43.54,00:35:43.54,someone trying to win a voteshould they make it to the final
497,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,tribal council.How'd this come into play?
498,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,">> On the night he was votedout, he asked, ""Can you give me"
499,00:35:51.96,00:35:51.96,"my hat?""So I brought his hat."
500,00:35:54.88,00:35:54.88,It has sentimental value forhim.
501,00:35:57.71,00:35:57.71,>> PROBST: I just want to makesure I have the facts right.
502,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,This is the same guy who waspart of your little coalition
503,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"that you blindsided, and nowyou're bringing the hat back"
504,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,just because it's gotsentimental value.
505,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,"Becky, did you know Yul wasgoing to bring the hat?"
506,00:36:09.54,00:36:09.54,>> Yul had announced he wasgoing to bring the hat back to
507,00:36:12.00,00:36:12.00,"Jonathan.Even if he doesn't admit to it,"
508,00:36:14.92,00:36:14.92,I'm sure he was thinking in theback of his head he might want
509,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,to win some favor back fromJonathan.
510,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,">> PROBST: Parvati, these votesover here are going to be worth"
511,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,a million dollars to somebody.Bringing back somebody's
512,00:36:25.79,00:36:25.79,"favorite hat could easily turnsomebody into, ""You know what?"
513,00:36:29.29,00:36:29.29,"At least he brought me my hat.Becky sure didn't, Sundra sure"
514,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"didn't.Ozzy didn't."""
515,00:36:34.29,00:36:34.29,>> Absolutely.And Yul has been playing this
516,00:36:36.38,00:36:36.38,"game to win votes, I think, fromthe beginning."
517,00:36:40.12,00:36:40.12,Yul has been playing this gameseamlessly from the start.
518,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,">> PROBST: Adam, are youstarting to see people play for"
519,00:36:46.62,00:36:46.62,the jury a bit?Because they don't know what's
520,00:36:49.46,00:36:49.46,happening back at camp.>> I don't think Sundra and
521,00:36:52.79,00:36:52.79,Becky or Ozzy are playing forthe jury.
522,00:36:56.17,00:36:56.17,"Yul might be a little bit.I mean, the hat... I don't know"
523,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,"what his intentions were.>> PROBST: Yes, Yul, please?"
524,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,">> All right, well, I'll justgive you the honest truth."
525,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,I wanted him to get his hatback.
526,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,"He made a request to me, and,you know, if I voted him out, I"
527,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,would want to appease any kindof resentment he might have
528,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,"towards me.So, you know, it serves both"
529,00:37:13.04,00:37:13.04,"purposes.>> PROBST: So Parvati, you, due"
530,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,"to your performance at thereward challenge, got to partake"
531,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,in a big spa with Yul and Ozzy.Did that give you some time to
532,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"try and bond with these guys?>> Oh, I would say I bonded with"
533,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,the fellas.We had a really good time.
534,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,"And it, like, made everyone calmdown and, like, regain a little"
535,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"bit of sanity.So, I don't know, me and two"
536,00:37:41.04,00:37:41.04,"guys in a hot tub, odds were inmy favor, I guess."
537,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,">> PROBST: Adam, a littleconcern that even though you and"
538,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"Parvati are sort of mates inthis, she got some time to bond"
539,00:37:51.58,00:37:51.58,with Yul and Ozzy.Maybe she goes up one notch and
540,00:37:54.96,00:37:54.96,"you drop a notch.>> You know, I think I'm at the"
541,00:37:57.71,00:37:57.71,"bottom of the totem pole, so Idon't think I can drop any more."
542,00:38:00.46,00:38:00.46,"So if she goes up, it's not overme."
543,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,>> PROBST: Why do you think youare still in this game?
544,00:38:06.29,00:38:06.29,You seem to be the biggestphysical threat on paper.
545,00:38:09.42,00:38:09.42,">> I haven't produced very well,though, Jeff."
546,00:38:12.04,00:38:12.04,"I think my heart's in it, butI'm not quite all there"
547,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,"physically and mentally anymore.>> PROBST: Yul, on the flip"

550,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,as much as he's helping himself?>> Absolutely.
551,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,We all recognize that that's thereason why we've been
552,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"successful so far.But internally, we're very"
553,00:38:35.25,00:38:35.25,"tight, and we get fartherworking together than we would"
554,00:38:37.38,00:38:37.38,"individually.So yeah, absolutely."
