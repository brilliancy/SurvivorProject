22,00:01:04.00,00:01:04.00,"if we're just our six without Jonathan, so it's sort of nice"
23,00:01:07.25,00:01:07.25,"that he's on Exile right now. >> PROBST: At the challenge,"
24,00:01:13.08,00:01:13.08,immunity was in the balance. Ozzy having no trouble.
25,00:01:16.04,00:01:16.04,Ozzy very close. And Ozzy once again shut
26,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,everyone out. Ozzy wins immunity!
27,00:01:24.54,00:01:24.54,Ozzy was safe. >> Why not have me or Parvati in

47,00:02:27.08,00:02:27.08,"Jonathan being voted off. You know, I just feel better now"
48,00:02:30.42,00:02:30.42,"that I'm in the game and Jonathan's not, because, you"

54,00:02:55.38,00:02:55.38,We are in a weak spot. It's going to take a lot of
55,00:02:58.21,00:02:58.21,"smooth talking to try to get them to, you know, open their"
56,00:03:00.17,00:03:00.17,eyes. I have to put it in a way like
57,00:03:03.25,00:03:03.25,it doesn't seem like they're betraying their old tribe.
58,00:03:06.50,00:03:06.50,"And that's going to be very difficult, because I know that"
59,00:03:08.67,00:03:08.67,"they all are fiercely loyal to each other right now, and me and"
60,00:03:12.00,00:03:12.00,Adam are on the outside. People are going to have to
61,00:03:14.29,00:03:14.29,start turning on each other. >> Exactly.
62,00:03:17.71,00:03:17.71,"Yeah, I know. >> We're the underdogs."
63,00:03:19.71,00:03:19.71,We've got to fight. >> I know.
64,00:03:21.42,00:03:21.42,We are. We've got to try.

76,00:05:24.79,00:05:24.79,something crazy. Something muddy.
77,00:05:26.54,00:05:26.54,>> Yep. >> And the reward sounds great.

83,00:05:48.21,00:05:48.21,We're the underdogs. >> Yeah.
84,00:05:50.29,00:05:50.29,">> The four of the Aitu tribe is very tight, so I'm sure they"
85,00:05:53.92,00:05:53.92,won't be sending any of each other to exile.
86,00:05:56.25,00:05:56.25,"You know, so that's the plan. We've got to make it happen."
87,00:06:05.00,00:06:05.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Time to get dirty."

117,00:07:51.08,00:07:51.08,What strategy will you use to get the mud back?
118,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,You can put mud on your heads. Make sure you're not carrying
119,00:07:57.21,00:07:57.21,mud in your hands. Adam coming back with mud.
120,00:08:06.38,00:08:06.38,Yul coming back. Ozzy coming back.
121,00:08:09.42,00:08:09.42,"Yul covered in mud, getting all of it off."

129,00:08:44.38,00:08:44.38,"as much mud out as she can. Parvati loading up her chest,"
130,00:08:48.04,00:08:48.04,trying to keep it up there without carrying it.
131,00:08:50.25,00:08:50.25,"Adam's just using his long legs, scraping them off."
132,00:08:53.12,00:08:53.12,Ozzy got a nice load on his hair.
133,00:08:56.25,00:08:56.25,"Can he keep it? He does, through the hitching"
134,00:08:58.21,00:08:58.21,post. That's a lot of mud in that
135,00:09:01.25,00:09:01.25,bucket. Like watching bad performance
136,00:09:05.42,00:09:05.42,art. Ozzy heading back out for more
137,00:09:09.12,00:09:09.12,mud. Two minutes left.

144,00:09:43.58,00:09:43.58,And it works. 30 seconds left!
145,00:09:45.75,00:09:45.75,This is going to be it. Parvati making a go of it with a
146,00:09:48.12,00:09:48.12,ton of mud on her head. That could move Parvati up.
147,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,Ozzy coming back with more mud. Ozzy's bucket's nearly full.
148,00:09:54.08,00:09:54.08,20 seconds. Yul getting everything he can

153,00:10:28.58,00:10:28.58,"my gut, and we're going to start with what I think is the most,"
154,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,see if anybody can beat it. Ozzy weighs in at 45 pounds of
155,00:10:39.79,00:10:39.79,"mud. Ozzy, come on up."
156,00:10:42.92,00:10:42.92,You're in the number one spot. So not only are we looking for

158,00:10:50.75,00:10:50.75,"Let's start with Parvati, see where you're at."

160,00:10:58.25,00:10:58.25,>> Half. >> PROBST: Take a spot next to

163,00:11:10.04,00:11:10.04,22 pounds. Adam currently in third place.
164,00:11:16.38,00:11:16.38,So Adam has the least amount of weight right now.
165,00:11:19.21,00:11:19.21,"Sundra, you need 22 pounds to crack the top three."
166,00:11:23.08,00:11:23.08,Sundra clocks in at 20 pounds. Not enough.
167,00:11:26.58,00:11:26.58,Let's see what Becky has. Becky clocks in at 20 pounds.
168,00:11:34.71,00:11:34.71,"Not enough. Yul, in order to break this top"
169,00:11:37.25,00:11:37.25,"three, you've got to have to have 22 pounds."
170,00:11:39.75,00:11:39.75,"Otherwise, you three are going on reward."
171,00:11:46.25,00:11:46.25,"By a half a pound, Yul wins. >> Whoa!"
172,00:11:53.00,00:11:53.00,">> PROBST: As close as it gets. So Ozzy, Parvati, and Yul, all"
173,00:11:59.21,00:11:59.21,"enjoying a spa reward. Ozzy, big decision for you now."
174,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,"Six days left in this game. You're sending Becky, Adam, or"
175,00:12:07.04,00:12:07.04,"Sundra to Exile Island. >> Sorry, bro."
176,00:12:11.79,00:12:11.79,">> I know. >> Sorry, man."
177,00:12:13.92,00:12:13.92,">> I'm really sorry. >> PROBST: Adam, straight down"
178,00:12:16.29,00:12:16.29,"to the beach. >> Love you, Adam."

181,00:12:27.04,00:12:27.04,time at the spa. >> Thank you.
182,00:12:30.04,00:12:30.04,>> PROBST: You're going as you are.
183,00:12:31.83,00:12:31.83,You'll get cleaned up at the spa.
184,00:12:33.21,00:12:33.21,Head on out. >> Of course it's raining.
185,00:13:11.92,00:13:11.92,>> I really wish I was at the reward.
186,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,But I'm not going to cry. I'm not going to get upset.
187,00:13:23.17,00:13:23.17,I'm happy to be here just with Becky.
188,00:13:25.12,00:13:25.12,"As opposed to anybody else, yeah, because, you know, we've"
189,00:13:27.58,00:13:27.58,been... we've been rolling with the punches together.
190,00:13:33.12,00:13:33.12,">> You know, and today I seriously saw that."
191,00:13:35.33,00:13:35.33,And I was like... I don't know. We're being foolish.
192,00:13:37.71,00:13:37.71,"I mean, we're fools in the sense of just saying, ""Okay, let's go"
193,00:13:41.25,00:13:41.25,"on staying strong,"" because we're going to have to face them"
194,00:13:43.71,00:13:43.71,"in the end. I mean, just, like, today I saw"
195,00:13:47.33,00:13:47.33,that. It was so blatant.
196,00:13:50.62,00:13:50.62,"You know, like, his whole bucket was full, and none of us were"
197,00:13:53.04,00:13:53.04,"even close. Like, this is his element."
198,00:13:55.12,00:13:55.12,">> Yeah, I know. >> He's like... you can't beat"
199,00:13:57.08,00:13:57.08,him. The challenge today told me a
200,00:14:00.17,00:14:00.17,"lot in the sense of Ozzy really likes to win, and regardless of,"
201,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,"you know, if it's immunity or reward."
202,00:14:08.71,00:14:08.71,It's not even about that. It's not even about the prize at
203,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,the end. Ozzy just hates to lose.
204,00:14:18.04,00:14:18.04,>> You know what I mean? >> That's what I'm saying.
205,00:14:20.12,00:14:20.12,It wasn't even close for first place.
206,00:14:21.33,00:14:21.33,"You know, I can't risk the sense of him winning every immunity"
207,00:14:23.92,00:14:23.92,"challenge and every reward, and so that's just been lingering in"
208,00:14:27.08,00:14:27.08,"my head that, you know, he is a bigger threat than I think"
209,00:14:29.21,00:14:29.21,people realize. >> I think at this point in the
210,00:14:51.33,00:14:51.33,"game, this is really frustrating for me, because I'm on the"
211,00:14:56.12,00:14:56.12,outside and I don't know what to do.
212,00:14:58.33,00:14:58.33,I think the only thing that I can do now is try pulling
213,00:15:00.58,00:15:00.58,someone over to my side and making them play a strategic
214,00:15:02.96,00:15:02.96,"game. And really, I mean, I think Ozzy"
215,00:15:06.12,00:15:06.12,"would be my only hope. >> Hi, how are you?"
216,00:15:21.29,00:15:21.29,>> Good. >> It's beautiful.
217,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,>> Hi! Thank you.
218,00:15:30.25,00:15:30.25,">> Yes, yes, yes. >> A good shower."
219,00:15:34.42,00:15:34.42,">> Oh, wow, beautiful! >> It's nice."
220,00:15:41.08,00:15:41.08,">> Oh, my god! >> Oh, god!"
221,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,"I will remember that shower, that one particular shower, for"
222,00:15:55.50,00:15:55.50,the rest of my life. Because it was hands-down the
223,00:15:59.25,00:15:59.25,best shower I've ever had. And that was just the beginning.
224,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,>> Have you had a massage before?
225,00:16:03.12,00:16:03.12,>> I've never had a massage before.
226,00:16:05.12,00:16:05.12,>> You've never had a massage? >> No.
227,00:16:07.08,00:16:07.08,">> Oh, you're in for a treat. We got a massage after that,"
228,00:16:09.79,00:16:09.79,which was awesome. It's a nice reminder of life
229,00:16:13.08,00:16:13.08,outside of this game. They're giving a hot rock
230,00:16:19.25,00:16:19.25,"massage, and they're massaging my legs right now."
231,00:16:23.21,00:16:23.21,It feels great. >> It smells so good.
232,00:16:26.21,00:16:26.21,What is that smell? >> It's coconut.
233,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,">> Okay, there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
234,00:16:32.33,00:16:32.33,"All I have left is five days of dirt, and I can do it."
235,00:16:35.21,00:16:35.21,I've gone 34 days. I can go five more.
236,00:16:57.46,00:16:57.46,>> This is the third time out on Exile Island.
237,00:17:01.00,00:17:01.00,Third time's a charm. Except for the charm's not here
238,00:17:03.21,00:17:03.21,"anymore-- Yul's got it. So it hurts to be out here, not"
239,00:17:06.29,00:17:06.29,"being with Parvati, just to strategize."
240,00:17:10.08,00:17:10.08,"Hopefully, Parvati can find some way to break up the old Aitutaki"
241,00:17:14.75,00:17:14.75,tribe. Who needs a fire when you can
242,00:17:20.17,00:17:20.17,"eat everything raw, right? I hope I can get some sleep, be"
243,00:17:24.38,00:17:24.38,nourished for the challenge that I've got ahead of me.
244,00:17:39.92,00:17:39.92,It was awful. It was pouring down rain.
245,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33,"I just laid there, and shivering and cold."
246,00:17:47.21,00:17:47.21,Not a good thing to go through. So I've got to keep fighting and
247,00:17:49.71,00:17:49.71,just put up with it for a little bit longer.
248,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,>> I feel like its a fairy tale and I'm going to pinch myself
249,00:18:02.08,00:18:02.08,"and wake up in the sandy, gross tent."
250,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,">> Well, at least when we go back, there's only four more"
251,00:18:07.25,00:18:07.25,days. >> Kind of a big deal.
252,00:18:09.58,00:18:09.58,">> A really big deal. >> I mean, a lot of things can"
253,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,"happen. You're, like, in the same"
254,00:18:14.29,00:18:14.29,position that for a long time I felt like I was.
255,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,You have to win. Have to win.
256,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,">> Ozzy's kind of a loner, so it's hard to get to know him."
257,00:18:21.88,00:18:21.88,But he's opened up to me a little bit.
258,00:18:24.25,00:18:24.25,"Oh, my god! So many different flavors."
259,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"Nothing tastes like coconut. The more charming I can be, the"
260,00:18:34.12,00:18:34.12,"more, like, friendly and in I can get with these people,"
261,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,"especially Ozzy, the longer I'm going to stick around."
262,00:18:45.04,00:18:45.04,"Power outage? >> In the middle of dinner,"
263,00:18:49.42,00:18:49.42,"raging storm, and then all of a sudden a blackout."
264,00:18:53.25,00:18:53.25,"We lit candles all over the place, and it turned out to be"
265,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,"very beautiful ambiance. >> All of a sudden, this island"
266,00:19:09.21,00:19:09.21,band comes and sets up in the middle of the living room.
267,00:19:11.79,00:19:11.79,"And then these dancers come running in, and they're all,"
268,00:19:14.33,00:19:14.33,"like, doing the native dances and singing, and it was just"
269,00:19:17.92,00:19:17.92,"this huge island show. It was, like, way better than"
270,00:19:20.58,00:19:20.58,"dinner and a movie. After everything's done, like, I"
271,00:19:26.54,00:19:26.54,"have a little champagne and some wine in me, so we just took off"
272,00:19:30.79,00:19:30.79,our pajamas and hopped in the hot tub.
273,00:19:38.33,00:19:38.33,I'm nervous. I just peed in my pants and I
274,00:19:49.21,00:19:49.21,wasn't even wearing any. >> I don't know if Parvati is
275,00:19:52.58,00:19:52.58,flirting with Ozzy only because she's hoping there might be some
276,00:19:56.50,00:19:56.50,"strategic option there. Ozzy, to some extent, might be"
277,00:19:59.79,00:19:59.79,"reciprocating. I mean, if Ozzy responds in some"
278,00:20:02.54,00:20:02.54,"way, maybe somewhere down the line, something might come up."
279,00:20:05.62,00:20:05.62,>> I've got two naked guys in the hot tub.
280,00:20:10.04,00:20:10.04,>> Yeah. >> Yee-hah!
281,00:20:12.38,00:20:12.38,>> But the numbers are in my favor at least this once.
282,00:20:16.33,00:20:16.33,">> I am looking out for myself. I mean, I've been playing this"
283,00:20:19.25,00:20:19.25,"game on an individual level since I got here, and I'm"
284,00:20:23.33,00:20:23.33,playing it now more than ever. So I might play the game with
285,00:20:26.12,00:20:26.12,Parvati while there's still the opportunity.
286,00:20:47.25,00:20:47.25,">> Camp life the last two days has been pretty relaxing, just"
287,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,basically Sundra and me. If there's one person I think I
288,00:20:53.58,00:20:53.58,"miss, probably it would be Yul, because I've been having some"
289,00:20:57.67,00:20:57.67,"thought about new strategy. You know, I would like to get"
290,00:21:01.12,00:21:01.12,Ozzy out sooner than later. >> We're back.
291,00:21:04.79,00:21:04.79,">> Hi. >> Hi, girls."
292,00:21:08.42,00:21:08.42,">> Hey, guys. >> How you doing?"
293,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,>> Good. >> It's okay.
294,00:21:15.29,00:21:15.29,"No, don't feel bad. >> I came back to camp, and I"
295,00:21:20.96,00:21:20.96,could tell something was a little bit tense with Becky.
296,00:21:24.71,00:21:24.71,>> Some of the stuff that me and Sundra have been talking about
297,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,was that we want to change up the order.
298,00:21:32.42,00:21:32.42,>> Okay. So Becky took me out to the back
299,00:21:34.58,00:21:34.58,beach and we had a conversation. >> I know that we want the Aitu
300,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,"four to go forward as much as possible, and everything."
301,00:21:41.00,00:21:41.00,But just seeing his bucket full... he didn't win by a
302,00:21:43.58,00:21:43.58,"little bit. He beat us all, like, by a lot."
303,00:21:47.54,00:21:47.54,"He's a very strong competitor, whatever it is-- balance,"
304,00:21:50.08,00:21:50.08,endurance-- because he's playing... he just loves to win.
305,00:21:53.58,00:21:53.58,>> I think any of us would have a hard time against Ozzy.
306,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,I would not be happy going to the final two with Ozzy.
307,00:22:00.42,00:22:00.42,Any one of us going against Ozzy would be likely to lose on the
308,00:22:03.04,00:22:03.04,jury. Ozzy has been gaining a lot of
309,00:22:05.71,00:22:05.71,"favor with members of the old Raro tribe, because they"
310,00:22:08.25,00:22:08.25,"perceive him as being, you know, kind of a pure player."
311,00:22:10.58,00:22:10.58,"He's doing his own thing. He's not strategizing, he's not"
312,00:22:13.08,00:22:13.08,building coalitions. He's playing a straight-up game
313,00:22:15.75,00:22:15.75,and he's doing a hell of a job of it.
314,00:22:18.08,00:22:18.08,"Either we go to the final four and take the high road, or we"
315,00:22:20.79,00:22:20.79,really play the game to the final end and we take steps to
316,00:22:25.88,00:22:25.88,ensure that both of us get there.
317,00:22:39.71,00:22:39.71,>> Where's Parvati? >> There was always a concern
318,00:23:02.92,00:23:02.92,"that maybe Ozzy would go with whomever has the best, you know,"
319,00:23:07.29,00:23:07.29,sell for him. So I think definitely Parvati is
320,00:23:11.00,00:23:11.00,a threat. >> Becky said that you think
321,00:23:13.21,00:23:13.21,Parvati is a threat. I think she's a huge threat.
322,00:23:15.08,00:23:15.08,I've been very surprised at how strong she's been consistently
323,00:23:17.58,00:23:17.58,"in all of these challenges. At the same time, you know, we"
324,00:23:21.08,00:23:21.08,"might have to vote off Ozzy. >> You know, at this point, we"
325,00:23:26.71,00:23:26.71,"know that the other two Raro members are desperate, so, you"
326,00:23:29.12,00:23:29.12,"know, it's just one more thing of ""Let's cover our bases, let's"
327,00:23:31.04,00:23:31.04,"cover our bases, let's cover our bases."""
328,00:23:33.12,00:23:33.12,"We don't want any more surprises, because it's getting"
329,00:23:35.25,00:23:35.25,"to that point. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
330,00:23:59.96,00:23:59.96,"We'll now bring in Adam, returning from Exile Island."
331,00:24:11.04,00:24:11.04,">> How you doing? Ah, you know."
332,00:24:13.29,00:24:13.29,">> How was last night? >> It was a little rough, a"
333,00:24:15.67,00:24:15.67,"little rough. >> Welcome back, welcome back."
334,00:24:17.83,00:24:17.83,">> But, you know, that's Exile Island for you."
335,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
336,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,>> Yeah. >> Yes.
337,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,">> PROBST: First things first. Ozzy, take back the necklace."
338,00:24:30.54,00:24:30.54,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
339,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,"For today's challenge, one at a time, you will carry four"
340,00:24:37.33,00:24:37.33,bundles of puzzle pieces across the balance beams to your mat.
341,00:24:42.62,00:24:42.62,"Once you've collected all four bundles, you will use those"
342,00:24:46.42,00:24:46.42,"bundles to create a table maze. Finally, you will use the maze"
343,00:24:51.12,00:24:51.12,to maneuver one cannonball past decoy holes into each of the two
344,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,corner pockets. First person to complete this
345,00:25:00.58,00:25:00.58,"wins immunity, guaranteed a one in five shot at winning this"
346,00:25:06.38,00:25:06.38,game. >> Yeah.
347,00:25:09.54,00:25:09.54,">> PROBST: We'll draw for spots, we'll get started."
348,00:25:14.25,00:25:14.25,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
349,00:25:17.79,00:25:17.79,Go! One bundle at a time across the
350,00:25:20.75,00:25:20.75,beams. Ozzy off to a quick lead.
351,00:25:33.71,00:25:33.71,Ozzy across with his first bundle.
352,00:25:37.92,00:25:37.92,"Adam, got to go back, landed behind the line."
353,00:25:47.92,00:25:47.92,"Becky takes a huge leap, barely makes it over the line."
354,00:25:51.38,00:25:51.38,Ozzy across with his second Bundle.
355,00:25:59.25,00:25:59.25,Yul makes it across with his first bundle.
356,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,Sundra still working with her first bundle.
357,00:26:06.17,00:26:06.17,Ozzy across easily with his third bundle.
358,00:26:11.04,00:26:11.04,Yul using his head for balance. Parvati's across with her first
359,00:26:17.67,00:26:17.67,bundle. Yul's across with his second
360,00:26:19.67,00:26:19.67,bundle. Becky takes a bad fall.
361,00:26:27.71,00:26:27.71,Keeps going. Ozzy trying to hang on with his
362,00:26:32.83,00:26:32.83,fourth and final bundle. Ozzy's across.
363,00:26:37.71,00:26:37.71,He can start working on the maze.
364,00:26:45.54,00:26:45.54,"Parvati's across, Yul's across. Yul now with his third bundle."
365,00:26:49.04,00:26:49.04,Parvati with her second. Ozzy untying his puzzle pieces.
366,00:26:54.25,00:26:54.25,"Sundra falls off, has to go back."
367,00:26:57.12,00:26:57.12,Adam cannot get across. Yul now catching up on Ozzy with
368,00:27:00.46,00:27:00.46,his fourth bundle. Can he keep his balance?
369,00:27:08.54,00:27:08.54,Adam falls off again. Yul clears it with a huge leap.
370,00:27:11.58,00:27:11.58,Yul has his fourth bundle. It's Yul and Ozzy working on
371,00:27:14.42,00:27:14.42,their table maze. Parvati across with her third
372,00:27:22.29,00:27:22.29,bundle. Adam and Sundra yet to get a
373,00:27:24.62,00:27:24.62,bundle across. Yul making quick work of his
374,00:27:31.96,00:27:31.96,maze. Adam cannot hang on again.
375,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,Parvati across with her fourth bundle.
376,00:27:40.04,00:27:40.04,She starts to work on the maze. Becky across with her second
377,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,bundle. >> Come on!
378,00:27:48.17,00:27:48.17,>> PROBST: Adam struggling to hang on.
379,00:27:50.33,00:27:50.33,"Adam falls off again, getting frustrated."
380,00:27:52.29,00:27:52.29,Two days on Exile taking their toll.
381,00:27:56.25,00:27:56.25,Parvati trying to get her pieces untied to get in this.
382,00:28:00.25,00:28:00.25,Immunity on the line. Ozzy has his maze together.
383,00:28:05.83,00:28:05.83,Ozzy maneuvering his first cannonball.
384,00:28:09.38,00:28:09.38,He's got to get one ball in each of the two corner pockets.
385,00:28:13.21,00:28:13.21,Yul does not have his maze together correctly.
386,00:28:16.58,00:28:16.58,He's put a roadblock up for himself.
387,00:28:19.83,00:28:19.83,Ozzy maneuvering it past one of the decoy holes.
388,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,Got to get around it. And he does.
389,00:28:27.08,00:28:27.08,Now he's got to get it into one of the two side pockets.
390,00:28:31.50,00:28:31.50,Ozzy has his first cannonball in one pocket.
391,00:28:34.88,00:28:34.88,Now he's got to get the other pocket.
392,00:28:37.25,00:28:37.25,Yul desperately trying to get this maze put together directly
393,00:28:39.25,00:28:39.25,to have a shot. Parvati still laying hers out on
394,00:28:42.38,00:28:42.38,the ground. Ozzy working the maze nicely.
395,00:28:46.12,00:28:46.12,Got to get this ball in his other pocket now.
396,00:28:53.67,00:28:53.67,"Ozzy wins immunity! >> Good job, man."
397,00:29:04.21,00:29:04.21,">> PROBST: Ozzy, come on over. Once again, Ozzy is safe from"
398,00:29:10.12,00:29:10.12,"the vote. As for the rest you, after 36"
399,00:29:14.21,00:29:14.21,"long days, this game will come to an end tonight for one of"
400,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,you. Should be a very interesting
401,00:29:19.08,00:29:19.08,afternoon. See you at tribal.
402,00:29:46.42,00:29:46.42,">> Today Ozzy won immunity, as usual."
403,00:29:49.08,00:29:49.08,"I mean, he's just becoming a bigger and bigger threat, so"
404,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,we're all pretty aligned on voting out one of the Raro
405,00:29:54.04,00:29:54.04,"folks, either Adam or Parvati. It's just a question of who to"
406,00:29:56.96,00:29:56.96,vote out first. >> Yeah.
407,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,">> I'm not positive, but I don't think so."
408,00:30:07.38,00:30:07.38,>> Is it Parvati? >> I think it might be Parvati.
409,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,">> Obviously, I want her to stay around but I know it's one of us"
410,00:30:12.04,00:30:12.04,"two. >> It's really a toss-up, but, I"
411,00:30:14.25,00:30:14.25,"mean, if you want to stay... >> I want to stay."
412,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,"If you could make that work, that would be awesome."
413,00:30:18.29,00:30:18.29,">> I like you a lot, and, like, I don't feel you deserved to go"
414,00:30:22.58,00:30:22.58,to Exile Island. It was real close.
415,00:30:25.04,00:30:25.04,"If you want to stay, you'll stay."
416,00:30:27.38,00:30:27.38,">> Yul is definitely the puppet master here, and he acts like"
417,00:30:29.92,00:30:29.92,"it, too. He told me, ""If you want to stay"
418,00:30:32.38,00:30:32.38,"I'll take care of it. It's a done deal."""
419,00:30:34.58,00:30:34.58,>> I'm pretty sure I can make it happen.
420,00:30:36.38,00:30:36.38,">> Dude, that would be awesome. >> All right."
421,00:30:38.21,00:30:38.21,">> You're the man. My thinking is, as long as it's"
422,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,"benefiting me, I'm fine with it. You know, Parvati and I have"
423,00:30:46.88,00:30:46.88,"been together since the beginning, and I want us both to"
424,00:30:50.50,00:30:50.50,"continue to be in this game. But if one of us has to go, you"
425,00:30:54.12,00:30:54.12,"know, I'd rather her than me. And then, when it's down to"
426,00:30:58.21,00:30:58.21,"five, I think my best shot is to win challenges."
427,00:31:08.04,00:31:08.04,">> I don't want to, like, pit myself against Adam because, you"
428,00:31:12.17,00:31:12.17,"know, I care about him, and... but I know that it's one of us"
429,00:31:14.96,00:31:14.96,"tonight, you know? >> I think objectively you're"
430,00:31:17.62,00:31:17.62,"probably the bigger threat between and you Adam, mainly"
431,00:31:22.62,00:31:22.62,because you're very coordinated. So anything kind of requiring
432,00:31:25.04,00:31:25.04,that... >> Balance and agility?
433,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,">> Yeah, balance, agility. Like, I think... I mean, you're"
434,00:31:29.12,00:31:29.12,far more of a threat than Adam is.
435,00:31:31.58,00:31:31.58,"But because we have Ozzy, and to some extent me, I'm less worried"
436,00:31:35.83,00:31:35.83,"about you as a threat. So for me, I actually see Adam"
437,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,"as being the bigger threat. Anyway, so that's what I'm"
438,00:31:42.67,00:31:42.67,thinking so you know where I kind of stand.
439,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,">> I am hopeful, because Yul says that he sees Adam as being"
440,00:31:48.96,00:31:48.96,the bigger threat right now. But I don't know how... I'm not
441,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,"going to bank on it at all. So, basically, I'm going to have"
442,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,to scramble something together and try to stay in this game
443,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"tonight. Who are you voting tonight,"
444,00:32:03.33,00:32:03.33,Adam? >> I don't know who I'm going to
445,00:32:06.29,00:32:06.29,"vote for, but I'm not going to vote for you or Ozzy."
446,00:32:09.62,00:32:09.62,"Either Becky, Sundra, or Yul. >> I just feel already my"
447,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17,"position is so precarious, that if I do something like that, and"
448,00:32:41.04,00:32:41.04,"then I lost, then I'd definitely be gone."
449,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,">> Yeah, but you'd be gone anyway when you lose, because"
450,00:32:46.88,00:32:46.88,you're such a threat. >> Yeah.
451,00:32:49.96,00:32:49.96,"I feel like I do dominate at this point in the challenges,"
452,00:32:52.75,00:32:52.75,"but I am worried that Yul, Sundra, and Becky might kick me"
453,00:32:57.04,00:32:57.04,out in the future. So I'm just trying to cover all
454,00:33:01.42,00:33:01.42,the bases at this point and make sure that I've got more of an
455,00:33:06.21,00:33:06.21,edge later on in the game. So maybe Sundra might be the one
456,00:33:09.62,00:33:09.62,who's going tonight. >> He's in the shelter now.
457,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,>> All three? >> Yeah.
458,00:33:17.12,00:33:17.12,>> You think they're going to try to work over Ozzy?
459,00:33:20.62,00:33:20.62,And is there any chance they would convince him to do
460,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,anything? >> Those three versus us three.
461,00:33:27.08,00:33:27.08,">> Oh! >> Are you worried, like..."
462,00:33:29.79,00:33:29.79,">> That Ozzy might be flipping? >> Right now, we noticed that"
463,00:33:33.38,00:33:33.38,Parvati and Adam were talking to Ozzy inside the shelter by
464,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00,"themselves, so just to kind of mitigate any possibility they"
465,00:33:40.79,00:33:40.79,might be trying to work Ozzy over and get an alliance going
466,00:33:43.33,00:33:43.33,"with them, I suggested that I or someone else go over and just"
467,00:33:47.46,00:33:47.46,sit in. Can I get in the shelter real
468,00:33:50.33,00:33:50.33,"quick? You know, I know you guys are"
469,00:33:55.25,00:33:55.25,"playing the game, but don't try to get Ozzy against us."
470,00:33:57.71,00:33:57.71,>> I'm not trying to get him. He was sitting here with
471,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,"Parvati, and I've got to say something."
472,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33,">> I know. Okay, okay."
473,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,Do you understand? I can't sit here and just not
474,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,"say anything. >> Yeah, okay."
475,00:34:07.96,00:34:07.96,It makes me uneasy the way Yul reacted.
476,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,So maybe I was talking more than I should have.
477,00:34:12.88,00:34:12.88,I... tonight I have the most uneasy feeling.
478,00:34:17.21,00:34:17.21,"And, you know, I just think that the chances are greater that"
479,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,I'll be voted off. >> Do you think Jonathan would
480,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,get mad if I showed up wearing the hat?
481,00:34:28.71,00:34:28.71,Do you think that he would get mad at that?
482,00:34:30.79,00:34:30.79,>> I don't know. You could try.
483,00:34:32.75,00:34:32.75,>> Do you think Jeff is going to yell at me?
484,00:34:34.54,00:34:34.54,"Jonathan, you know, he wanted his hat, and I thought I would"
485,00:34:38.21,00:34:38.21,"give it to him. You know, if I got voted out and"
486,00:34:41.12,00:34:41.12,it and I left something that meant a lot to me here and I
487,00:34:43.00,00:34:43.00,"just asked someone to give it to me, I'd expect them to do it."
488,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"I just feel like it's, like, a nice thing to do."
489,00:34:47.08,00:34:47.08,">> Let's call you ""Yonathan."" >> Yulathan."
490,00:34:51.62,00:34:51.62,>> Yulathan. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
491,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,"the members of the jury. Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,"
492,00:35:20.62,00:35:20.62,"Candice, and Jonathan, voted out at the last tribal council."
493,00:35:31.21,00:35:31.21,"Well, normally, the jury doesn't have any involvement other than"
494,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,"listening, but Yul brought your hat, Jonathan."
495,00:35:37.29,00:35:37.29,>> I see. Thank you very much.
496,00:35:39.46,00:35:39.46,>> PROBST: Quite possibly the boldest move I've seen yet from
497,00:35:43.54,00:35:43.54,someone trying to win a vote should they make it to the final
498,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,tribal council. How'd this come into play?
499,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,">> On the night he was voted out, he asked, ""Can you give me"
500,00:35:51.96,00:35:51.96,"my hat?"" So I brought his hat."
501,00:35:54.88,00:35:54.88,It has sentimental value for him.
502,00:35:57.71,00:35:57.71,>> PROBST: I just want to make sure I have the facts right.
503,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,This is the same guy who was part of your little coalition
504,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"that you blindsided, and now you're bringing the hat back"
505,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,just because it's got sentimental value.
506,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,"Becky, did you know Yul was going to bring the hat?"
507,00:36:09.54,00:36:09.54,>> Yul had announced he was going to bring the hat back to
508,00:36:12.00,00:36:12.00,"Jonathan. Even if he doesn't admit to it,"
509,00:36:14.92,00:36:14.92,I'm sure he was thinking in the back of his head he might want
510,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,to win some favor back from Jonathan.
511,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,">> PROBST: Parvati, these votes over here are going to be worth"
512,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,a million dollars to somebody. Bringing back somebody's
513,00:36:25.79,00:36:25.79,"favorite hat could easily turn somebody into, ""You know what?"
514,00:36:29.29,00:36:29.29,"At least he brought me my hat. Becky sure didn't, Sundra sure"
515,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"didn't. Ozzy didn't."""
516,00:36:34.29,00:36:34.29,>> Absolutely. And Yul has been playing this
517,00:36:36.38,00:36:36.38,"game to win votes, I think, from the beginning."
518,00:36:40.12,00:36:40.12,Yul has been playing this game seamlessly from the start.
519,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,">> PROBST: Adam, are you starting to see people play for"
520,00:36:46.62,00:36:46.62,the jury a bit? Because they don't know what's
521,00:36:49.46,00:36:49.46,happening back at camp. >> I don't think Sundra and
522,00:36:52.79,00:36:52.79,Becky or Ozzy are playing for the jury.
523,00:36:56.17,00:36:56.17,"Yul might be a little bit. I mean, the hat... I don't know"
524,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,"what his intentions were. >> PROBST: Yes, Yul, please?"
525,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,">> All right, well, I'll just give you the honest truth."
526,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,I wanted him to get his hat back.
527,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,"He made a request to me, and, you know, if I voted him out, I"
528,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,would want to appease any kind of resentment he might have
529,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,"towards me. So, you know, it serves both"
530,00:37:13.04,00:37:13.04,"purposes. >> PROBST: So Parvati, you, due"
531,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,"to your performance at the reward challenge, got to partake"
532,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,in a big spa with Yul and Ozzy. Did that give you some time to
533,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"try and bond with these guys? >> Oh, I would say I bonded with"
534,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,the fellas. We had a really good time.
535,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,"And it, like, made everyone calm down and, like, regain a little"
536,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"bit of sanity. So, I don't know, me and two"
537,00:37:41.04,00:37:41.04,"guys in a hot tub, odds were in my favor, I guess."
538,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,">> PROBST: Adam, a little concern that even though you and"
539,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"Parvati are sort of mates in this, she got some time to bond"
540,00:37:51.58,00:37:51.58,with Yul and Ozzy. Maybe she goes up one notch and
541,00:37:54.96,00:37:54.96,"you drop a notch. >> You know, I think I'm at the"
542,00:37:57.71,00:37:57.71,"bottom of the totem pole, so I don't think I can drop any more."
543,00:38:00.46,00:38:00.46,"So if she goes up, it's not over me."
544,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,>> PROBST: Why do you think you are still in this game?
545,00:38:06.29,00:38:06.29,You seem to be the biggest physical threat on paper.
546,00:38:09.42,00:38:09.42,">> I haven't produced very well, though, Jeff."
547,00:38:12.04,00:38:12.04,"I think my heart's in it, but I'm not quite all there"
548,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,"physically and mentally anymore. >> PROBST: Yul, on the flip"
549,00:38:18.08,00:38:18.08,"side, does it concern you that Ozzy, who is certainly"
550,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,"dominating in challenges, is actually helping the Aitu four"
551,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,as much as he's helping himself? >> Absolutely.
552,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,We all recognize that that's the reason why we've been
553,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"successful so far. But internally, we're very"
554,00:38:35.25,00:38:35.25,"tight, and we get farther working together than we would"
555,00:38:37.38,00:38:37.38,"individually. So yeah, absolutely."
