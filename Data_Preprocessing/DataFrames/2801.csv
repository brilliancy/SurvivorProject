1274,01:16:56.10,01:16:56.10,>> THINK ABOUT IT. >> WHERE DID ALL THAT RICE COME
1275,01:17:10.67,01:17:10.67,FROM? WHO POURED RICE ON THE FIRE?
1276,01:17:12.20,01:17:12.20,>> I DON'T KNOW. >> THE RICE FAIRY?

1283,01:17:38.60,01:17:38.60,THEN SHE DUMPED OUR RICE OUT AND NOW WE HAVE NO RICE.

1290,01:18:05.63,01:18:05.63,GOING TO APPROACH J'TIA ABOUT TURNING THIS AROUND.
1291,01:18:09.03,01:18:09.03,"BUT THEN I GET BACK TO CAMP, AND SHE JUST POURED ALL OF OUR RICE"
1292,01:18:12.77,01:18:12.77,ON THE FIRE. I CAN'T ALIGN WITH SOMEONE LIKE

1302,01:19:04.90,01:19:04.90,">> YEAH, I SUGGESTED HEY, SPENCER, HEY, GARRETT, CAN WE"
1303,01:19:08.70,01:19:08.70,JUST GO TALK. BUT THEN GARRETT MADE THE
1304,01:19:11.03,01:19:11.03,"SUGGESTIONS, NO, LET'S ALL JUST TALK RIGHT HERE."
1305,01:19:13.13,01:19:13.13,>> Jeff: GARRETT YWHY HAVE THIS OPEN DISCUSSION?
1306,01:19:20.27,01:19:20.27,WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR THAT? >> I WANTED KASS TON WE WERE
1307,01:19:24.37,01:19:24.37,"ANYTHING TO BE WORK HER, AND I WANTED HER TO SAY THAT WE WERE"
1308,01:19:27.60,01:19:27.60,GOING TO VOTE WITH J'TIA AND WE WERE WITH KASS AND THAT WOULD
1309,01:19:32.77,01:19:32.77,CALM HER NERVES. >> I ASKED WHY GARRETT GOT TO
1310,01:19:37.17,01:19:37.17,CALL ALL THE SHOTS AND I THREW THE RICE IN THE FIRE.
1311,01:19:39.80,01:19:39.80,>> Jeff: WOW. ALL THE RICE?
1312,01:19:41.63,01:19:41.63,>> MOST OF IT. >> JUST ABOUT.
1313,01:19:43.20,01:19:43.20,">> LIKE, LITERALLY, 98% OF IT. >> YEAH, NOT MY BEST MOMENT."
1314,01:19:46.67,01:19:46.67,"NOT AT ALL. >> BUT, JEFF, I CAN ADD, THAT'S"
1315,01:19:49.90,01:19:49.90,WHY I WANTED TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION PRIVATELY.
1316,01:19:52.53,01:19:52.53,SHE'S VOLATILE. I KNEW THAT WE WERE HEADING DOWN
1317,01:19:55.23,01:19:55.23,THE WRONG TRACK WITH THIS ONE. >> Jeff: YOU GUYS ARE
1318,01:19:57.37,01:19:57.37,RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING HER SHE WAS GOING HOME.
1319,01:20:00.50,01:20:00.50,THERE'S A REASON BLINDSIDES WORK.
1320,01:20:02.93,01:20:02.93,IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE FUN. IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EFFECTIVE.
1321,01:20:05.37,01:20:05.37,>> THE ONLY THING GOING OUT AND HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
1322,01:20:08.63,01:20:08.63,"IT DOES IS PUT OUR ""SURVIVOR"" GAME AT STAKE."
1323,01:20:11.77,01:20:11.77,I WAS NEVER TRYING TO MASTERMIND ANYTHING.
1324,01:20:14.27,01:20:14.27,">> BASICALLY, YOU PUT ME OVER YOUR KNEE AND SPANKED MY ASS IN"
1325,01:20:19.73,01:20:19.73,FRONT OF EVERYBODY. >> THAT'S WILDLY UNTRUE.
1326,01:20:21.57,01:20:21.57,">> OKAY. >> AT THIS POINT, SHE'S GOING"
1327,01:20:23.30,01:20:23.30,"HOME, AND SHE DESTROYS 98% OF OUR RICE, AND BY PAINTING ME IN"
1328,01:20:28.27,01:20:28.27,A NEGATIVE LIGHT IN FRONT OF MY TRIBE MATES IS VERY UNFAIR.
1329,01:20:33.53,01:20:33.53,">> Jeff: KASS, WHERE DO YOU FALL ON THIS?"
1330,01:20:35.53,01:20:35.53,"YOU HEARD TWO SIDES NOW, J'TIA AND GARRETT?"
1331,01:20:38.37,01:20:38.37,">> JEFF, THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL SO PARANOID."
1332,01:20:41.40,01:20:41.40,I WAS DOWN AT THE WATER WITH TASHA WASHING OUR FEET AFTER THE
1333,01:20:45.90,01:20:45.90,CHALLENGE AND GATOR WAS SO PARANOID HE CAME DOWN TO THE
1334,01:20:49.03,01:20:49.03,WATER AND THEN THE RICE GOT POURED OUT.
1335,01:20:51.47,01:20:51.47,>> THAT'S NOT FAIR. >> IT'S THE RICE AND IT'S GONE.
1336,01:20:53.80,01:20:53.80,>> IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE A TALK RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL
1337,01:20:56.27,01:20:56.27,"COUNCIL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO JUST SIT THERE."
1338,01:20:58.30,01:20:58.30,">> WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT, 30 DAYS' WORTH OF RICE OR WATCHING"
1339,01:21:02.87,01:21:02.87,US WASH OUR FEET? >> Jeff: WOW.
1340,01:21:05.10,01:21:05.10,">> JEFF, I FEEL LIKE MY GAME IS BEING STIFLED RIGHT NOW,"
1341,01:21:08.53,01:21:08.53,"LITERALLY STIFLED. HOW CAN YOU PLAY ""SURVIVOR"" WHEN"
1342,01:21:11.60,01:21:11.60,YOU CAN'T HAVE CONVERSATIONS? >> TASHA WAS UTSET TODAY BECAUSE
1343,01:21:15.97,01:21:15.97,J'TIA WAS HER CLOSEST ALLY. IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.
1344,01:21:18.53,01:21:18.53,"YOU CAN ASK THE OTHERS IN THE ALLIANCE-- I'M SORRY, IN THE"
1345,01:21:22.73,01:21:22.73,TRIBE. SO WE WANT J'TIA TOOK.
1346,01:21:24.60,01:21:24.60,OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO UPSET HER.
1347,01:21:26.23,01:21:26.23,">> Jeff: KASS, YOU CHUCKLED WHEN HE SAID ""ALLIANCE"" AND"
1348,01:21:30.03,01:21:30.03,"FIXED IT BY SAYING ""TRIBE."" >> BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THE"
1349,01:21:33.50,01:21:33.50,"ALLIANCE. >> YOU DON'T THINK YOU, SPENCER,"
1350,01:21:35.53,01:21:35.53,AND I WORKED OUT AN ALLIANCE ON DAY FOUR.
1351,01:21:38.50,01:21:38.50,">> OH, YOU'RE OUT. >> NOW I'M OUT."
1352,01:21:41.70,01:21:41.70,>> Jeff: WOW. >> SO IT IS FLEXIBLE.
1353,01:21:44.67,01:21:44.67,AND GARRETT DECIDES WHO'S IN AND OUT.
1354,01:21:46.83,01:21:46.83,">> Jeff: SO IF I HAVE IT RIGHT, THE WAY IT SITS NOW IS"
1355,01:21:51.87,01:21:51.87,"IT'S GARRETT, KASS, AND SPENCER IN AN ALLIANCE."
1356,01:21:55.47,01:21:55.47,J'TIA AND TASHA ARE IN TROUBLE. J'TIA IS PROBABLY GOING HOME
1357,01:21:58.80,01:21:58.80,TONIGHT. >> I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT
1358,01:22:00.83,01:22:00.83,ALL. >> Jeff: ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
1359,01:22:01.93,01:22:01.93,JUST SAID? >> IF J'TIA GOES HOME.
1360,01:22:04.67,01:22:04.67,"WE HAVE FOUR PLAYERS, ALL OF WHOM CAN BE ONE STRONG TEAM."
1361,01:22:08.80,01:22:08.80,">> Jeff: MAYBE I'M MALNOURISHED, SPENCER, AM I"
1362,01:22:11.90,01:22:11.90,"WRONG? >> YOU'RE NOT WRONG, THAT'S"
1363,01:22:14.43,01:22:14.43,EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. >> WHEN KASS CAME TO SPENCER AND
1364,01:22:17.57,01:22:17.57,"I AND SAID, ""YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BREAK YOU WANT GIRLS,"

1370,01:22:33.67,01:22:33.67,AND SPENCER AND SAID LET'S BREAK YOU WANT WOMEN AND FORM OUR OWN
1371,01:22:39.57,01:22:39.57,ALLIANCE TRUE OR FALSE? >> GARRETT SAID THAT.
1372,01:22:42.70,01:22:42.70,THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN. >> Jeff: HOW DO YOU TRUST
1373,01:22:45.93,01:22:45.93,GARRETT? >> HOW DO YOU TRUST ANYBODY?
1374,01:22:49.07,01:22:49.07,">> I'M OUT OF THE ALLIANCE, IT'S NOT TRUE."
1375,01:22:52.90,01:22:52.90,"WE NEEDED TO SPLIT YOU UP, TASHA, THAT'S ALL."
1376,01:22:56.37,01:22:56.37,THE FOUR OF US ARE ALL EQUAL. >> WHICH FOUR?
