1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.62,00:00:02.62,"Survivor, Ozzy was in the best position to make it to the final"
3,00:00:06.75,00:00:06.75,four. He was in an alliance with the
4,00:00:09.88,00:00:09.88,"five remaining favorites. >> I trust them, and you've got"
5,00:00:12.75,00:00:12.75,to be able to trust some people in this game.
6,00:00:14.71,00:00:14.71,>> PROBST: And he had the hidden immunity idol.
7,00:00:18.08,00:00:18.08,"His only competition seemed to be Jason, who beat him in the"
8,00:00:21.08,00:00:21.08,first individual immunity challenge.
9,00:00:23.75,00:00:23.75,Nice work. At the second individual
10,00:00:25.96,00:00:25.96,"immunity challenge, it was down to Jason and Parvati when food"
11,00:00:29.92,00:00:29.92,was offered to the entire tribe if one of them dropped out.
12,00:00:33.88,00:00:33.88,>> Jason! You can make friends!
13,00:00:36.25,00:00:36.25,>> I won't vote you out. >> PROBST: Then everyone in the
14,00:00:38.08,00:00:38.08,tribe promised Jason they would spare him if he stepped down.
15,00:00:41.75,00:00:41.75,">> I'll guarantee. >> PROBST: Jason took the deal,"
16,00:00:45.21,00:00:45.21,giving up a chance at individual immunity in order to improve his
17,00:00:48.54,00:00:48.54,position within the tribe. >> Bon app\xc3\xa9tit.
18,00:00:50.62,00:00:50.62,>> Bon app\xc3\xa9tit. >> PROBST: The favorites agreed
19,00:00:52.83,00:00:52.83,to vote Jason out anyway. >> We'd have to be idiots not to
20,00:00:56.12,00:00:56.12,vote him out tonight. >> PROBST: But Parvati decided
21,00:00:59.25,00:00:59.25,to double-cross Ozzy instead. >> I'm going to have to be
22,00:01:02.67,00:01:02.67,untrustworthy and disloyal no matter what.
23,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50,">> PROBST: She recruited everyone but James, Amanda, and"
24,00:01:07.46,00:01:07.46,Erik and took Ozzy completely by surprise.
25,00:01:15.71,00:01:15.71,Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites
26,00:01:18.42,00:01:18.42,"and the second member of our jury, Ozzy."
27,00:01:22.42,00:01:22.42,"Ozzy, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left."
28,00:01:28.21,00:01:28.21,Who will be voted out tonight? >> I understand why it happened.
29,00:01:44.88,00:01:44.88,"But when you think about it, like, a blindside, it only works"
30,00:01:47.21,00:01:47.21,if it's airtight. >> Right.
31,00:01:49.25,00:01:49.25,">> And obviously, like, I felt obligated to Ozzy, so I would"
32,00:01:52.17,00:01:52.17,"have told him. I probably would have told him,"
33,00:01:53.88,00:01:53.88,and I think you guys did the right decision for... to pull
34,00:01:56.25,00:01:56.25,that off. I don't know where Amanda is
35,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,"right now. She totally, like, took off"
36,00:02:00.71,00:02:00.71,somewhere. >> Yeah.
37,00:02:02.46,00:02:02.46,>> And she's probably bumming like crazy.
38,00:02:05.96,00:02:05.96,>> It's just another game. >> Sometimes you got to pull the
39,00:02:08.83,00:02:08.83,punches. >> Yeah.
40,00:02:10.88,00:02:10.88,>> They got it. It's funny.
41,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,I like it. It was a good move by everybody.
42,00:02:15.17,00:02:15.17,>> I'm very upset about what happened last night.
43,00:02:17.62,00:02:17.62,What nerve for Cirie and Parvati to go behind my back and vote
44,00:02:21.42,00:02:21.42,"out Ozzy, making me look like an idiot and the rest of my"
45,00:02:24.21,00:02:24.21,alliance looking like idiots because we voted for Jason.
46,00:02:28.33,00:02:28.33,"You know, it's like Parv and Cirie and Alexis and Natalie are"
47,00:02:32.71,00:02:32.71,"an alliance now, and I think they want the men out of here."
48,00:02:36.88,00:02:36.88,"I thought we were fine up until those votes, and then another"
49,00:02:39.75,00:02:39.75,"Ozzy came up, and I was like, ""What the hell?"""
50,00:02:42.71,00:02:42.71,Every single person here wanted to vote for Jason.
51,00:02:48.04,00:02:48.04,It definitely told me that they're here to play this game.
52,00:02:50.12,00:02:50.12,Game on. Bring it on.
53,00:02:53.71,00:02:53.71,"Like, let's do this.  Captioning sponsored by"

55,00:03:04.71,00:03:04.71,( theme song playing ) >> So hot.
56,00:03:53.88,00:03:53.88,">> I know. If you give me one, I can add"
57,00:03:56.83,00:03:56.83,one from over this side. It's not so hot.
58,00:04:03.04,00:04:03.04,"What is that, meat on your finger hanging off like that?"
59,00:04:06.54,00:04:06.54,">> Yeah. I'm trying to put coconut juice,"
60,00:04:08.67,00:04:08.67,"coconut oil. >> Oh, oh."
61,00:04:11.12,00:04:11.12,James's finger wasn't really doing too good.
62,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67,He's had this cut on it for a few days now.
63,00:04:17.62,00:04:17.62,It was kind of swollen and kind of infected.
64,00:04:20.83,00:04:20.83,"You cannot just assume, ""Oh, this little cut, it's okay."
65,00:04:26.46,00:04:26.46,"So what, we're living in a damp, nasty cave with rats and bats"
66,00:04:31.88,00:04:31.88,"around us every 15 minutes. No, this'll be fine."""
67,00:04:43.83,00:04:43.83,>> I just did three loops around the island looking for your ass.
68,00:04:48.12,00:04:48.12,>> Who are you talking to? >> You.
69,00:04:49.62,00:04:49.62,"Where were you? Oh, my God!"
70,00:04:53.88,00:04:53.88,I need to do some serious damage control today.
71,00:04:57.12,00:04:57.12,"James and Amanda are pissed at me, furious for voting Oz out."
72,00:05:01.96,00:05:01.96,But I made my bed. I have to lie in it.
73,00:05:03.71,00:05:03.71,"I knew as soon as I made this move, things were going to get"
74,00:05:06.46,00:05:06.46,crazy. >> Where are you going with
75,00:05:12.12,00:05:12.12,this? >> Where am I going with what?
76,00:05:14.46,00:05:14.46,>> The paranoia got to you and you just made a big move.
77,00:05:17.62,00:05:17.62,">> What? >> I mean, you'll be all right."
78,00:05:19.29,00:05:19.29,>> I couldn't win against Ozzy. I would be a fool to have kept
79,00:05:21.75,00:05:21.75,him in the game. >> What is your plan?
80,00:05:24.71,00:05:24.71,Who are you taking with you? I'm just curious to know.
81,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,>> To three? >> Yeah.
82,00:05:29.12,00:05:29.12,">> Girls. >> Yeah, I figured that."
83,00:05:33.67,00:05:33.67,>> I just wanted to say sorry because I couldn't tell you.
84,00:05:35.96,00:05:35.96,">> No, sorry's not what you mean."
85,00:05:38.08,00:05:38.08,"Ha-ha's what you mean. >> Well, I wanted to talk to"
86,00:05:40.12,00:05:40.12,"you, because I like you. I didn't want it to be, like,"
87,00:05:42.46,00:05:42.46,"completely awkward. >> Oh, it's going to be awkward."
88,00:05:46.12,00:05:46.12,It's just funny. There's always one that always
89,00:05:49.83,00:05:49.83,"got to eat the apple, can't just leave the apple alone and just"
90,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,"enjoy the heavens. No, you got to chew on that"
91,00:05:54.29,00:05:54.29,"apple. >> Yeah, hopefully, because you"
92,00:06:04.75,00:06:04.75,wouldn't give me credit for having a plan anyways.
93,00:06:07.88,00:06:07.88,>> Why would I think that? >> Because that's pretty much
94,00:06:09.71,00:06:09.71,how you've been acting towards me this whole time.
95,00:06:11.29,00:06:11.29,>> That's a lie. >> That I'm stupid.
96,00:06:12.88,00:06:12.88,">> No, I didn't say you were stupid."
97,00:06:14.75,00:06:14.75,"I said you were selfish, not stupid."
98,00:06:16.08,00:06:16.08,"I mean, you can lie to me, you can fool me, you can deceive"
99,00:06:17.83,00:06:17.83,don't. Don't insult your intelligence.
100,00:06:19.54,00:06:19.54,Don't try to act like you're going to pull the wool over my
101,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,eyes with self-pity. Just don't come up here trying
102,00:06:24.83,00:06:24.83,"to give me a bunch of bluff. >> I just wanted to talk to you,"
103,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,honestly. >> Huh?
104,00:06:28.67,00:06:28.67,>> I just wanted to talk to you. >> And you have.
105,00:06:31.12,00:06:31.12,By her pulling that just showed me who she really is.
106,00:06:33.92,00:06:33.92,Do I put up with people like that?
107,00:06:35.83,00:06:35.83,No. That's what kind of person she
108,00:06:37.54,00:06:37.54,"is, and that's who we're dealing with, and I just can't stand it."
109,00:06:45.71,00:06:45.71,>> I feel really bad that I couldn't tell you last night.
110,00:06:48.08,00:06:48.08,"I know, like, you feel really out of the loop, but, like,"
111,00:06:51.33,00:06:51.33,you're not. >> What is the plan?
112,00:06:54.62,00:06:54.62,>> I'm thinking... >> Because obviously it's the
113,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,"girls together, right? >> I'm thinking final five"
114,00:07:00.62,00:07:00.62,"girls, you know? >> I don't want Parvati to know"
115,00:07:04.75,00:07:04.75,"that I'm mad at her, because Parvati is pretty much running"
116,00:07:07.88,00:07:07.88,the show at this point. She has Natalie and Alexis
117,00:07:10.17,00:07:10.17,"wrapped around her finger, and Cirie didn't even tell me that"
118,00:07:12.75,00:07:12.75,she was voting for Ozzy. So she's got little Cirie
119,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,"wrapped around her finger. You know, I just hope that we're"
120,00:07:20.12,00:07:20.12,all still cool. >> Yeah.
121,00:07:22.50,00:07:22.50,">> That's what I'm coming down here for, because I can tell"
122,00:07:25.08,00:07:25.08,you're not happy. >> I understand.
123,00:07:28.75,00:07:28.75,"Like, I really understand. >> Uh-huh."
124,00:07:30.62,00:07:30.62,">> I hope you guys trust me. >> No, no, we totally trust you."
125,00:07:33.33,00:07:33.33,It's just with Ozzy and not wanting him... we knew you
126,00:07:37.42,00:07:37.42,probably didn't want him to go just yet.
127,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,">> So is it still, like, us three to the end?"
128,00:07:41.71,00:07:41.71,>> I say yeah. >> I don't see why not.
129,00:07:44.25,00:07:44.25,">> Okay, yeah. >> Yeah."
130,00:07:45.75,00:07:45.75,">> All right. >> You know I love you, ""Legs."""
131,00:07:47.75,00:07:47.75,"Oh, I feel so bad for you. You look so sad."
132,00:07:50.17,00:07:50.17,">> You know, I'd like to believe them, but obviously, they have"
133,00:07:53.12,00:07:53.12,"other plans right now that I'm not aware of, and it'd be stupid"
134,00:07:57.25,00:07:57.25,of me to buy what they're telling me right now.
135,00:08:00.04,00:08:00.04,This is where the game gets interesting.

281,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,going to lose it. I'm going to lose it.

284,00:15:31.71,00:15:31.71,We all want him gone. The little bitch now has two

286,00:15:39.08,00:15:39.08,"Guaranteed, hands down, bitch will find it, and that bitch"
287,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,"being Jason. >> Hey, I'm not kidding."
288,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,"I say we check his bag when he gets back-- like, immediately,"
289,00:15:46.67,00:15:46.67,because it'll come just in his pants.
290,00:15:48.42,00:15:48.42,">> Definitely, like, the second we see him."
291,00:15:53.62,00:15:53.62,>> Yes! He has been on the biggest lucky
292,00:15:55.21,00:15:55.21,streak I have ever seen of anyone.
293,00:15:57.83,00:15:57.83,"If there was a lottery right now, he'd be winning it."
294,00:16:00.12,00:16:00.12,">> Well, it'd better rain. Like, if I want rain at all,"
295,00:16:01.75,00:16:01.75,it's tonight. >> Seriously.
296,00:16:17.17,00:16:17.17,">> ""To find the idol that you seek, go north to a familiar"

299,00:16:25.71,00:16:25.71,"Well, doesn't seem too hard. Go down there."
300,00:16:30.04,00:16:30.04,If my time out here goes similar to my last time out here finding
301,00:16:34.33,00:16:34.33,"the fake hidden immunity idol, you know, I should find it in a"
302,00:16:37.54,00:16:37.54,breeze. Number two.
303,00:16:40.62,00:16:40.62,"So far, the game has thrown me so many curves balls."
304,00:16:44.67,00:16:44.67,"But since stepping down from the last immunity challenge, I think"
305,00:16:48.04,00:16:48.04,things have definitely changed for me out here.
306,00:16:52.96,00:16:52.96,"I was a little bummed right away when Natalie chose me, but"
307,00:16:56.54,00:16:56.54,hopefully Natalie sent me out to Exile Island so that I could
308,00:17:00.50,00:17:00.50,find it in the event that Natalie and I might work
309,00:17:04.08,00:17:04.08,together in using the hidden immunity idol.
310,00:17:07.29,00:17:07.29,"Okay, back across the waterway there."
311,00:17:10.21,00:17:10.21,"I believe that I can trust Natalie in the fact that, one,"
312,00:17:13.92,00:17:13.92,she kept her word to me at last tribal council when we voted out
313,00:17:17.67,00:17:17.67,"Ozzy, and it's in her best interest to keep me along in"
314,00:17:21.08,00:17:21.08,this game. There you go.
315,00:17:30.04,00:17:30.04,Oh! Yes!
316,00:17:39.71,00:17:39.71,I feel pretty stupid falling for the fact that Ozzy made me a
317,00:17:42.75,00:17:42.75,fake idol. This is not the fake hidden
318,00:17:46.67,00:17:46.67,"immunity idol, and the decision of Natalie to send me to Exile"
319,00:17:50.83,00:17:50.83,Island was a strategic move on her part.
320,00:17:54.04,00:17:54.04,"I feel like for the first time in the game, I'm actually part"
321,00:17:57.12,00:17:57.12,of a successful alliance. Right now I feel the most
322,00:18:01.62,00:18:01.62,comfortable I've felt in the entire game.
323,00:18:19.62,00:18:19.62,">> Yeah. >> You know, we have to act as"
324,00:18:21.71,00:18:21.71,if Jason has the idol. >> Yeah.
325,00:18:24.25,00:18:24.25,">> We need to have a plan. >> As far as the idol goes,"
326,00:18:26.42,00:18:26.42,"like, I don't want anything bouncing off and getting one of"
327,00:18:28.08,00:18:28.08,"us. >> I mean, if Jason doesn't win"
328,00:18:29.92,00:18:29.92,"tomorrow, cool, as planned. >> Right, but just in case he"
329,00:18:32.12,00:18:32.12,"has the idol, we still have to split the vote."

331,00:18:41.04,00:18:41.04,"this challenge besides him, let's do it."
332,00:18:44.54,00:18:44.54,"Like, whatever we need to do. >> Yeah."
333,00:18:46.71,00:18:46.71,">> We have to get into his head, or else I don't think he's going"
334,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,"to lose. >> Yeah, I agree."
335,00:18:49.62,00:18:49.62,I think we can get in his head. >> He won't buy anything I say
336,00:18:51.29,00:18:51.29,"to him, so... >> Nat can say it."
337,00:18:52.96,00:18:52.96,I know he'll believe Nat. >> We've concocted a beautiful
338,00:18:56.25,00:18:56.25,"plan to disarm Jason's lack of trust, make him feel"
339,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,"comfortable, make him feel comfortable enough."
340,00:19:02.96,00:19:02.96,So we want to blindside him with not using his immunity and
341,00:19:07.54,00:19:07.54,"allowing one of us to win; therefore, he doesn't win, and"
342,00:19:11.62,00:19:11.62,"he's out. Worst-case scenario, he has to"
343,00:19:13.83,00:19:13.83,"play his idol, and he stays, but at least his idol's up and out."
344,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,"You know, before the next immunity, as soon as I see"
345,00:19:21.96,00:19:21.96,"Jason, be like, ""Dude, I saved your ass once."
346,00:19:24.46,00:19:24.46,I basically gave you the immunity idol.
347,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,"You owe me."" >> That's all you have to say."
348,00:19:30.83,00:19:30.83,>> I just think that it's similar to Ozzy in the sense
349,00:19:32.62,00:19:32.62,that we have one chance to blindside him.
350,00:19:36.83,00:19:36.83,">> Yeah. >> At this point, Jason would be"
351,00:19:39.88,00:19:39.88,an idiot not to believe anything I say.
352,00:19:42.04,00:19:42.04,"He thinks that I'm warming up to him, which I am absolutely not."
353,00:19:46.62,00:19:46.62,"If this goes, I mean, this will just be brilliant, because not"
354,00:19:49.25,00:19:49.25,only will it happen... have happened once with Ozzy; it'll
355,00:19:52.04,00:19:52.04,"happen twice, back to back, girls against the guys."

370,00:20:55.25,00:20:55.25,"because I feel like I could be gone on my birthday, and that"
371,00:20:57.21,00:20:57.21,"would be terrible. Big, green birthday present."
372,00:21:00.04,00:21:00.04,>> Happy birthday. >> Happy birthday.

377,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,all the other steps leading up to the end of this game for the
378,00:21:18.21,00:21:18.21,"girls. >> What else is in there, Nat,"
379,00:21:20.08,00:21:20.08,"anything? >> No key, I hope."
380,00:21:21.96,00:21:21.96,">> A key and a chain. >> Oh, no."
381,00:21:24.33,00:21:24.33,>> A lock and chain. I don't want to do any diving.
382,00:21:26.75,00:21:26.75,">> If all goes to plan, Jason will feel comfortable enough not"
383,00:21:29.75,00:21:29.75,to play his idol and he will not win immunity today.
384,00:21:33.88,00:21:33.88,"So he's done. Worst-case scenario, James goes"
385,00:21:37.21,00:21:37.21,"home tonight in lieu of Jason, if we can't get Jason."
386,00:21:42.21,00:21:42.21,So it's either James or Jason tonight.
387,00:21:44.88,00:21:44.88,And as evil as women can be and diabolical and cutthroat and go
388,00:21:49.33,00:21:49.33,"for the jugular as women are and just suck blood, we do want Erik"
389,00:21:53.08,00:21:53.08,to have a good birthday on day 30.
390,00:21:54.88,00:21:54.88,Today's his birthday. He's 22.
391,00:21:56.12,00:21:56.12,"So he's not going home today. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
392,00:22:23.42,00:22:23.42,"We'll now bring in Jason, returning from Exile Island."
393,00:22:29.04,00:22:29.04,>> How was the line? Be honest.
394,00:22:31.12,00:22:31.12,">> Welcome back. >> Hi, guys."
395,00:22:32.88,00:22:32.88,>> Howdy. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get

401,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,"When you break your tile, you'll drop a bundle of puzzle pieces."
402,00:22:59.17,00:22:59.17,"The first four to break their tile move on to the next round,"
403,00:23:02.71,00:23:02.71,where you will dig for a key to unlock the puzzle pieces.
404,00:23:06.21,00:23:06.21,"You'll then assemble the wheel, place it onto a winch, then spin"
405,00:23:10.62,00:23:10.62,the wheel to lower a set of two planks.
406,00:23:14.21,00:23:14.21,The first two to lower their planks move on to the final
407,00:23:17.54,00:23:17.54,"round, where you will use those planks to cross a rope bridge."
408,00:23:21.71,00:23:21.71,You'll then make your way across a series of discs and to the
409,00:23:24.21,00:23:24.21,finish platform. First person to the platform
410,00:23:27.96,00:23:27.96,"wins immunity, is guaranteed at least one more day in this game."

417,00:24:09.25,00:24:09.25,Jason's moving on. Erik's moving on.
418,00:24:14.46,00:24:14.46,James is moving on. We're looking for one more
419,00:24:17.75,00:24:17.75,"person, and it is Amanda. Amanda, James, Erik, and Jason"
420,00:24:21.25,00:24:21.25,moving on to the next round. Here we go.
421,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,The first two to lower their planks and cross the black line

424,00:24:41.62,00:24:41.62,key. James has his key.
425,00:24:48.62,00:24:48.62,Erik has his key. James and Erik both have their
426,00:24:51.38,00:24:51.38,"keys. Got to unwrap them, then unlock"
427,00:24:54.08,00:24:54.08,those puzzle pieces. Jason's found his key.
428,00:24:57.50,00:24:57.50,He's working on it. James has his lock undone.
429,00:25:02.25,00:25:02.25,"Amanda is still digging. >> Hey, where is it?"
430,00:25:05.21,00:25:05.21,>> PROBST: Erik has his lock open.
431,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,"James working on the puzzle, has it together quickly."
432,00:25:14.58,00:25:14.58,Erik working on his puzzle. James and Erik both lowering
433,00:25:20.38,00:25:20.38,their planks. Two people are moving on.

440,00:25:43.08,00:25:43.08,final. Here we go.

442,00:25:53.12,00:25:53.12,Survivors ready? Go!
443,00:25:56.71,00:25:56.71,Got to make your way across using your planks.
444,00:26:01.17,00:26:01.17,"Very different strategies. James trying to go sideways,"
445,00:26:05.29,00:26:05.29,"trying to keep his balance, and it doesn't work."
446,00:26:07.54,00:26:07.54,James is in. Got to go back to the start.
447,00:26:13.21,00:26:13.21,>> Don't knock Erik over. You're going to knock him over.

449,00:26:17.92,00:26:17.92,lot of time. James tried a strategy that did
450,00:26:20.96,00:26:20.96,"not work. Erik doing something similar,"
451,00:26:23.92,00:26:23.92,"going from the side, but he's using his knees."
452,00:26:27.17,00:26:27.17,"James trying a new strategy, struggling to hang on."
453,00:26:32.29,00:26:32.29,"Erik not panicking at all, taking his time, keeping that"
454,00:26:35.71,00:26:35.71,lead. Immunity and a one-in-seven shot
455,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,for the winner of this challenge.
456,00:26:42.71,00:26:42.71,Erik doing a good job of going slow and easy.
457,00:26:46.12,00:26:46.12,"James is in the role of having to move quickly, try and make up"
458,00:26:48.75,00:26:48.75,"ground, take some risks. He's gaining on Erik."
459,00:26:53.12,00:26:53.12,Erik now going back to riskier moves.
460,00:26:56.71,00:26:56.71,"Instead of one plank at a time, he's skipping."
461,00:26:59.92,00:26:59.92,James making up some ground again.
462,00:27:02.17,00:27:02.17,>> ...the rest of the way. >> PROBST: James is back in it.
463,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,">> Oh, oh, oh, oh. >> PROBST: Erik getting very"
464,00:27:07.17,00:27:07.17,close. Erik to the platform.
465,00:27:10.21,00:27:10.21,Now he's got to make his way across the discs.
466,00:27:12.83,00:27:12.83,James to the platform. James has got to get across the
467,00:27:15.92,00:27:15.92,discs. First to the pole.
468,00:27:18.75,00:27:18.75,Erik wins immunity! ( applause )
469,00:27:22.12,00:27:22.12,>> Damn. >> Happy birthday!
470,00:27:26.25,00:27:26.25,">> Woo! >> PROBST: Erik, come on up."
471,00:27:31.17,00:27:31.17,">> Nice job, Erik. >> PROBST: A round of applause."
472,00:27:33.25,00:27:33.25,Congratulations. Erik safe tonight at tribal
473,00:27:35.38,00:27:35.38,"council. For the rest of you, somebody is"
474,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,going home tonight. Grab your stuff.
475,00:27:39.96,00:27:39.96,Head back to camp. I will see you at tribal.
476,00:27:59.75,00:27:59.75,">> Birthday boy. Hey, Erik, it's your birthday."
477,00:28:02.79,00:28:02.79,One out of eight. I keep telling you.
478,00:28:08.29,00:28:08.29,"You won on your birthday. >> I was telling them, what are"
479,00:28:10.71,00:28:10.71,"the odds, honestly? >> That's awesome."
480,00:28:12.96,00:28:12.96,I'm proud of you. That was a tough one too.
481,00:28:15.79,00:28:15.79,>> I thought so. >> I'm going to get a puff ball
482,00:28:18.00,00:28:18.00,"or two, maybe bring it into the cave."
483,00:28:22.25,00:28:22.25,"( Parvati squealing ) >> So far, part A of the plan is"
484,00:28:33.42,00:28:33.42,"perfect. >> I looked over at Parvati, and"
485,00:28:36.38,00:28:36.38,"we were like, ""Run, Erik!"" >> I was so nervous."
486,00:28:41.75,00:28:41.75,I was hyperventilating. I was like...
487,00:28:43.33,00:28:43.33,">> When Erik made it, I jumped up like... I didn't scream,"
488,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,though. >> So the fact that it came down
489,00:28:50.04,00:28:50.04,"to Erik and James in the end, and we needed Erik to win in"
490,00:28:53.08,00:28:53.08,"order for the plan to work out, and then Erik did win, I was"
491,00:28:56.12,00:28:56.12,ecstatic. I think all the girls were
492,00:28:58.92,00:28:58.92,jumping up and down and screaming silently inside their
493,00:29:00.96,00:29:00.96,heads. >> The plan is in play.
494,00:29:03.96,00:29:03.96,>> The plan is in play. ( laughter )
495,00:29:09.83,00:29:09.83,It's like the black widow brigade.
496,00:29:13.04,00:29:13.04,"Like, all the girls are coming together, and we're spinning the"
497,00:29:16.38,00:29:16.38,"guys around as much as we can, just spinning them and spinning"
498,00:29:18.71,00:29:18.71,"them, until they don't know which way is up, and then we're"
499,00:29:20.96,00:29:20.96,devouring them one at a time. >> Are you going to go look
500,00:29:33.25,00:29:33.25,for... what are you going to go do?
501,00:29:34.92,00:29:34.92,">> Yeah, I'm going to go look for crab too, in a little bit."
502,00:29:37.12,00:29:37.12,>> It's raining. They're not out when it rains.
503,00:29:41.50,00:29:41.50,>> And bring back some salt water.
504,00:29:45.04,00:29:45.04,>> You want to take that bucket? Or you're going to take the pot.
505,00:29:47.21,00:29:47.21,>> Yeah. >> Okay.
506,00:29:49.42,00:29:49.42,>> I'll look in the nets too. >> He didn't go anywhere but
507,00:30:03.42,00:30:03.42,"right here, right? >> He went down there."
508,00:30:07.12,00:30:07.12,">> I mean, he came straight up here."
509,00:30:09.21,00:30:09.21,Where is his stuff at? I don't know.
510,00:30:11.92,00:30:11.92,"Where's the bag? Oh, the bag is over there too."
511,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,"Hurry up, Nat. >> It's in here."
512,00:30:21.29,00:30:21.29,">> Oh, my God. >> It's in here."
513,00:30:27.00,00:30:27.00,>> Grab it. >> It's it.
514,00:30:31.17,00:30:31.17,>> That's the stuff. >> I knew he had it.
515,00:30:41.58,00:30:41.58,"Because he was like, ""I know you sent me for strategy purposes."""
516,00:30:45.29,00:30:45.29,>> He won't play it tonight. He won't play it tonight.
517,00:30:50.04,00:30:50.04,>> I told him I would go into everything a little bit later.
518,00:30:53.00,00:30:53.00,"But I'm like, ""This is done."" He's like, ""Oh."""
519,00:30:55.04,00:30:55.04,"He's like, ""You sent me for a reason, huh?"""
520,00:30:56.50,00:30:56.50,"I was like, ""Yeah."" I was able to have a"
521,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,"conversation with Jason at the challenge, literally 30 seconds,"
522,00:31:09.54,00:31:09.54,hopefully got my point across in one swift motion.
523,00:31:14.12,00:31:14.12,"So I think we're good. It would be perfect, it would be"
524,00:31:17.21,00:31:17.21,"brilliant for Jason to go out just like Ozzy-- blindsided, no"
525,00:31:21.58,00:31:21.58,idea that it's... what's hitting him in the face.
526,00:31:24.42,00:31:24.42,"I'd love it. >> And, yeah, we can use it"
527,00:31:36.38,00:31:36.38,"however... because I wanted to say to you personally, I didn't"
528,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"get a chance to yesterday, you know, but thank you for keeping"
529,00:31:43.25,00:31:43.25,"your word, and it means a lot to me, and you have mine in this"
530,00:31:46.21,00:31:46.21,"game from now on, so... >> Cool, cool, thank you."
531,00:31:49.92,00:31:49.92,So yeah. >> Yeah.
532,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,">> Uh, the thing is... here's the thing."
533,00:31:58.21,00:31:58.21,James is going home tonight. >> Is that what you're thinking?
534,00:32:02.12,00:32:02.12,>> Uh-huh. >> That'd be great.
535,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,"And yeah, to let you know, I did find it."
536,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,"And... yeah, like that. ( snaps fingers )"
537,00:32:11.04,00:32:11.04,>> Yeah. Did you see me ask Jeff.
538,00:32:13.50,00:32:13.50,"I was like, ""So is the immunity idol back out?"""
539,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,">> Uh-huh. >> And he was like, ""Oh, by the"
540,00:32:17.08,00:32:17.08,"way, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."" And you were like this, and I'm"
541,00:32:20.54,00:32:20.54,"like, ""And... Jason."" >> I know, I know."
542,00:32:23.25,00:32:23.25,But it was smart. It was very smart of you to send
543,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,me. I'm hoping that Natalie is
544,00:32:28.79,00:32:28.79,"telling the truth, that we're voting for James tonight."
545,00:32:32.00,00:32:32.00,"She kept her word to me at last tribal council, when we voted"
546,00:32:35.83,00:32:35.83,"out Ozzy, and you know, I'm going to have to trust her this"
547,00:32:39.00,00:32:39.00,tribal council as well. After what you guys did for me
548,00:32:41.96,00:32:41.96,"last time, my word is as good as your word, which, you know, so"
549,00:32:47.96,00:32:47.96,"far in this game, has been good, so..."
550,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,">> You know, I think I'm pretty evil."
551,00:32:55.08,00:32:55.08,I think I could be pretty evil. What I am now is I'm definitely
552,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,"in ""I will get you"" mode. I'm in game mode."
553,00:33:01.92,00:33:01.92,And now I'm actually having a lot more fun.
554,00:33:04.62,00:33:04.62,"I'm getting to be more of myself, which is proving to be"
555,00:33:11.17,00:33:11.17,pretty ruthless and pretty stone-cold bitch and pretty
556,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,cutthroat. And I have a smile on my face.
557,00:33:20.29,00:33:20.29,"Sorry about that. >> I have, like, searched every"
558,00:33:32.12,00:33:32.12,"avenue. I'm telling you, I don't know"
559,00:33:35.08,00:33:35.08,what to do. I honestly have no idea.
560,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,"You know what? If it's not him, I mean, they're"
561,00:33:52.25,00:33:52.25,writing your name down. >> Who is?
562,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,>> You are? >> Yeah.
563,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"Because I'm saying maybe you could too, but... you think?"
564,00:34:20.92,00:34:20.92,>> That'd be awesome. >> Yeah.
565,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,"I wouldn't mind. >> I get really, unbelievably"
566,00:34:36.58,00:34:36.58,"fourth grade uncomfortable when, like, any guy even remotely"
567,00:34:40.42,00:34:40.42,"makes a move. Like, I'm not the cool girl at"
568,00:34:42.29,00:34:42.29,all. >> Really?
569,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,">> Really, really. >> See, I'm like a man eater"
570,00:34:46.17,00:34:46.17,"now. I'm like, ""You..."""
571,00:34:47.50,00:34:47.50,>> Man eater! ( laughter )
572,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,">> I'd love to blindside Jason, because it would be 2-0, the"
573,00:34:57.54,00:34:57.54,"ladies, just at the jugular, flossing my teeth with his"
574,00:35:00.96,00:35:00.96,"jugular. Either way, it's a win-win."
575,00:35:08.96,00:35:08.96,"Either Jason goes home, or Jason stays and unearths the idol, or"
576,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,"it's James going home. Either way, it's still the five"
577,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,girls down to two guys. Picking them off...
578,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,one by one. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
579,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,"the members of the jury. So last tribal council, you not"
580,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,only vote out one of the strongest physical threats in
581,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,"this game, but you vote out one of the biggest providers."
582,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,"Parvati, does this group feel like we don't really need"
583,00:36:10.54,00:36:10.54,providers anymore? >> I think we've all felt kind
584,00:36:14.62,00:36:14.62,of okay on our own as far as providing for ourselves for a
585,00:36:17.04,00:36:17.04,"while. Like, every person is kind of"
586,00:36:19.38,00:36:19.38,"providing. >> PROBST: James, seeing that"
587,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,"they don't need providers anymore, another big physical"
588,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,"threat in this game is you. >> Yeah, it don't look that good"
589,00:36:28.71,00:36:28.71,for James right now. The social butterflies have done
590,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,"their work, and yeah, I'm definitely on the chopping"
591,00:36:34.96,00:36:34.96,block. >> PROBST: How frustrating would
592,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,"it be to be voted out tonight, James, after everything you've"
593,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,done in terms of keeping this tribe afloat?
594,00:36:43.38,00:36:43.38,>> It was all about trying not to make certain people eat that
595,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,"apple. You know, and if somebody want"
596,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33,"to be greedy-- Parvati, she want to make herself in a better"
597,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"position, so she did what she had to do."
598,00:36:52.42,00:36:52.42,"She got rid of Ozzy. And now I'm pretty much next,"
599,00:36:57.25,00:36:57.25,"you know, and it's very frustrating."
600,00:36:59.58,00:36:59.58,"I mean, I could try to politic, but I really suck at that."
601,00:37:02.96,00:37:02.96,"So, I mean, what can you do? >> PROBST: Erik, looking at"
602,00:37:06.50,00:37:06.50,"physical threats, obviously, you're a physical threat."
603,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,It's got to feel great to have immunity.
604,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,>> I couldn't agree more with that.
605,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"I mean, I felt like I was in the same position as James: if I"
606,00:37:15.92,00:37:15.92,"didn't win, then I was going home."
607,00:37:17.92,00:37:17.92,"And if everybody feels like they can provide for themselves,"
608,00:37:20.04,00:37:20.04,that's one more reason why you don't need Erik around.
609,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,>> PROBST: The other significant thing about the last vote is
610,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,"that you're still here, Jason. Has your social standing in this"
611,00:37:30.96,00:37:30.96,game truly changed as a result of stepping down off that
612,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,immunity challenge? >> Yeah.
613,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,Every little difference I make around camp is changing my
614,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,"social standing in this game. But I was sent away to Exile,"
615,00:37:44.12,00:37:44.12,"where I was gone for two days. So you know, it's difficult to"
616,00:37:47.29,00:37:47.29,say where I stand in the tribe right now.
617,00:37:49.96,00:37:49.96,>> PROBST: You say you're not sure because you were sent to
618,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,Exile Island. Two sides to that coin.
619,00:37:54.92,00:37:54.92,It could be a sentence to go there.
620,00:37:56.92,00:37:56.92,It could be an opportunity. >> It was an opportunity for me
621,00:38:00.79,00:38:00.79,"to look for the idol, but at this point in the game, I wanted"
622,00:38:04.25,00:38:04.25,"to stay with my tribe mates and really, you know, show them that"
623,00:38:07.62,00:38:07.62,"I can make these differences. So you know, I'll have to see"
624,00:38:10.58,00:38:10.58,"how it plays out. >> PROBST: Natalie, is it"
625,00:38:13.29,00:38:13.29,possible to change your standing in the game that quickly?
626,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,">> Absolutely. It's constantly changing,"
627,00:38:18.92,00:38:18.92,"constantly. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
628,00:38:22.33,00:38:22.33,"to the vote. Erik, you have the immunity"
629,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,"necklace, unless you want to do something crazy and give it to"
630,00:38:26.21,00:38:26.21,somebody else. >> I'm not crazy.
631,00:38:28.33,00:38:28.33,I think I'm going to keep it. >> PROBST: Erik is safe tonight.
632,00:38:30.17,00:38:30.17,You cannot vote for Erik. Everybody else is fair game.
633,00:38:32.83,00:38:32.83,It's time to vote. Amanda you're up.
634,00:38:45.58,00:38:45.58,">> James, you played a good game."
635,00:38:47.42,00:38:47.42,"Unfortunately, Parvati got you in the end."
636,00:38:59.12,00:38:59.12,>> You couldn't just frolic naked and enjoy the heavens.
637,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,You had to eat the damn apple. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
638,00:39:30.71,00:39:30.71,votes. If anybody has the hidden
639,00:39:45.71,00:39:45.71,"immunity idol, and you want to play it, now would be the time"
640,00:39:48.12,00:39:48.12,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
641,00:40:00.92,00:40:00.92,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
642,00:40:03.12,00:40:03.12,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
643,00:40:05.04,00:40:05.04,"I'll read the votes. First vote, James."
644,00:40:15.17,00:40:15.17,"Jason. One vote James, one vote Jason."
645,00:40:20.54,00:40:20.54,"James. Two votes James, one vote Jason."
646,00:40:28.04,00:40:28.04,"Parvati. Two votes James, one vote Jason,"
647,00:40:30.42,00:40:30.42,one vote Parvati. James.
648,00:40:35.50,00:40:35.50,"That's three votes James, one vote Jason, one vote Parvati."
649,00:40:42.21,00:40:42.21,"Jason. That's two votes Jason, three"
650,00:40:45.12,00:40:45.12,"votes James, one vote Parvati. Jason."
651,00:40:51.08,00:40:51.08,"That's three votes Jason, three votes James, one vote Parvati."
652,00:40:55.75,00:40:55.75,One vote left. 11th person voted out of
653,00:41:03.17,00:41:03.17,Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites and the third member of our
654,00:41:05.83,00:41:05.83,"jury, Jason. That's four."
655,00:41:08.29,00:41:08.29,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
656,00:41:23.50,00:41:23.50,"Jason, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
657,00:41:40.38,00:41:40.38,"Well, after back-to-back blindsides, anybody who still"
658,00:41:44.17,00:41:44.17,"feels safe is a fool. James, on your way out, I want"
659,00:41:48.29,00:41:48.29,"medical to look at your finger. Everybody else, grab your"
660,00:41:50.92,00:41:50.92,torches. Head back to camp.

669,00:42:22.12,00:42:22.12,The first clue awaits you at Exile Island.
670,00:42:31.17,00:42:31.17,>> That's Jeff Probst! He's just standing there!
671,00:42:38.33,00:42:38.33,>> I was definitely played today by Natalie and the rest of the
672,00:42:40.92,00:42:40.92,girls. They did the same thing in
673,00:42:43.50,00:42:43.50,voting out Ozzy. I should have been a little more
674,00:42:46.00,00:42:46.00,wary of what they were telling me.
675,00:42:48.83,00:42:48.83,What they did tonight will definitely come back to haunt
676,00:42:51.21,00:42:51.21,them as I'm sitting up there on the jury.
677,00:42:53.17,00:42:53.17,I just wish I would have been a little smarter and played the
678,00:42:55.17,00:42:55.17,hidden immunity idol when I had the chance.
