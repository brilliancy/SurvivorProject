618,00:43:28.67,00:43:28.67,You're guaranteed a spot in thefinal two.

621,00:43:37.00,00:43:37.00,Council.Big decision.
622,00:43:38.71,00:43:38.71,You have the opportunity tofigure it out.
623,00:43:40.25,00:43:40.25,Get your stuff.Bring the boat in.
624,00:44:31.25,00:44:31.25,>> God never makes it easy forme.
625,00:44:34.25,00:44:34.25,"The one immunity challenge Iwin is a last one, and it's a"
626,00:44:36.92,00:44:36.92,huge decision that I have tomake tonight-- who do I want to
627,00:44:41.08,00:44:41.08,"take with me to the final two,either Aras or Terry?"
628,00:44:44.50,00:44:44.50,"So, I mean, it was sogratifying to win the last"
629,00:44:47.12,00:44:47.12,"immunity challenge, but at thesame time, my brain started"
630,00:44:50.17,00:44:50.17,thinking right away.I knew I had a decision to make
631,00:44:53.75,00:44:53.75,tonight that could cost me orearn me a million dollars.
632,00:45:05.71,00:45:05.71,It's difficult because I toldTerry when I was on Exile
633,00:45:08.75,00:45:08.75,"Island with him that if eitherof us won, we would take each"
634,00:45:11.92,00:45:11.92,"other, but then it's like,during the challenge, Aras,"
635,00:45:16.25,00:45:16.25,"you know, I gave him, like, ahead nod, and so he jumped off,"
636,00:45:20.17,00:45:20.17,thinking that I would take himto the finals.
637,00:45:23.33,00:45:23.33,"And that doesn't mean anythingright now, because, at this"
638,00:45:26.58,00:45:26.58,"point, there's a milliondollars at stake, and I'm not"
639,00:45:29.12,00:45:29.12,going to take somebody because Imade a promise to them.
640,00:45:32.83,00:45:32.83,I'm going to take someone who Ithink I have a better chance of
641,00:45:35.21,00:45:35.21,beating.>> The big question.
642,00:45:54.29,00:45:54.29,>> Do you feel that it'sfair for me to take someone
643,00:46:00.12,00:46:00.12,"that I think can beat me?>> Um, I-I..."
644,00:46:05.08,00:46:05.08,">> As someone in my positionright now, because I didn't"
645,00:46:07.54,00:46:07.54,"expect to be in this position,to be honest with you."
646,00:46:10.25,00:46:10.25,">> Right, right.Um, had I won today, I would"
647,00:46:14.58,00:46:14.58,have already told you that youwere going to the finals with
648,00:46:19.75,00:46:19.75,me.You want to put this down?
649,00:46:21.25,00:46:21.25,">> Yeah.I know, I'm just trying to... I"
650,00:46:24.21,00:46:24.21,"did not expect to be in thisposition, and if you had given"
651,00:46:27.04,00:46:27.04,"me the hidden immunity idol, Iwould have 100% took you."
652,00:46:30.04,00:46:30.04,">> Right, right.>> Without any question, it"
653,00:46:31.62,00:46:31.62,wouldn't be an issue right now.I'm not saying I'm not taking
654,00:46:34.38,00:46:34.38,"you, 'cause I haven't...>> Right."
655,00:46:36.71,00:46:36.71,>> I'm just trying to go overeverything in my head and go
656,00:46:40.25,00:46:40.25,"over... you know, and if youwere in my shoes, you would do"
657,00:46:43.12,00:46:43.12,the same thing.You want to...
658,00:46:44.21,00:46:44.21,">> Right, right.>> You would want to bring"
659,00:46:45.83,00:46:45.83,someone... and it's a toss-up.>> You haven't...
660,00:46:48.04,00:46:48.04,>> It's not like one of you isbetter to bring than the other.
661,00:46:51.50,00:46:51.50,"So I'm just, like, freaking outbecause I won't... I don't..."
662,00:46:55.92,00:46:55.92,I don't know.>> Danielle is finding herself
663,00:46:58.04,00:46:58.04,"very confused right now, and,oh, God, I hope she's not"
664,00:47:04.17,00:47:04.17,confused when it comes to thepoint of choos... taking me to
665,00:47:06.62,00:47:06.62,"the finals.If I were a betting man, I would"
666,00:47:12.21,00:47:12.21,"choose me only because of theCasaya loyalty, and it would be"
667,00:47:17.58,00:47:17.58,"an easy decision.>> But by me taking you, they're"
668,00:47:19.62,00:47:19.62,gonna look at it as I'm alreadybeing disloyal to them 'cause
669,00:47:23.04,00:47:23.04,"I...>> No, no, because then it just"
670,00:47:25.46,00:47:25.46,makes the picture more black andwhite.
671,00:47:27.58,00:47:27.58,"""Oh, guys, yeah, I'm here.Thanks, you know?"
672,00:47:29.50,00:47:29.50,I kinda won a bunch ofchallenges and then was the
673,00:47:32.92,00:47:32.92,"nail in your side, you know?Can I please have your vote?"""
674,00:47:36.17,00:47:36.17,"Uh-uh, I don't think that'shappening."
675,00:47:38.17,00:47:38.17,And I know it's gonna be hard.>> I just hope you will respect
676,00:47:41.29,00:47:41.29,whatever decision I make.I honestly haven't made a
677,00:47:43.71,00:47:43.71,decision and I don't know whatI'm gonna do.
678,00:47:45.58,00:47:45.58,>> I have to. I have to.I'm not gonna sit there and
679,00:47:48.17,00:47:48.17,"throw daggers at you with myeyes from the jury, okay?"
680,00:47:51.58,00:47:51.58,>> Please.>> And it's been fun.
681,00:47:56.08,00:47:56.08,>> It has been fun.And this sucks.
682,00:47:59.08,00:47:59.08,I can't deal with this decision.I hate... I'm so indecisive as
683,00:48:03.04,00:48:03.04,"it is because I'm a Gemini.>> Okay, I think I'm gonna jump"
684,00:48:16.54,00:48:16.54,in the water.I think the tide was still going
685,00:48:18.67,00:48:18.67,"out.>> Yeah, I think so, too."
686,00:48:20.17,00:48:20.17,No doubt about it.When Terry and Danielle went to
687,00:48:23.58,00:48:23.58,"get water, I had my first bit ofparanoia in this game, more"
688,00:48:26.17,00:48:26.17,"than just a bit.I was, like, ""Man, what's going"
689,00:48:28.25,00:48:28.25,on?Are they talking about me?
690,00:48:29.62,00:48:29.62,"I mean, I know they're talkingabout me, but is she gonna get"
691,00:48:32.21,00:48:32.21,swayed?Is Terry gonna be able to sway
692,00:48:34.25,00:48:34.25,"her, bla-bla, bla?My mind starts racing."
693,00:48:35.58,00:48:35.58,"Like, I would just feel soburned if, like, you voted for"
694,00:48:38.17,00:48:38.17,"Terry instead of me, and mydumbass jumped off the lily pad"
695,00:48:40.58,00:48:40.58,"because you said ""Yeah,"" youknow?"
696,00:48:43.67,00:48:43.67,>> I haven't... I'm just goingover stuff in my head.
697,00:48:45.88,00:48:45.88,This is a huge decision.>> I know.
698,00:48:47.17,00:48:47.17,>> I wasn't expecting to winthis today.
699,00:48:49.25,00:48:49.25,"Like, I wasn't expecting it togo my way."
700,00:48:51.92,00:48:51.92,">> I think, honestly, I thinkyou have ten times better chance"
701,00:48:54.96,00:48:54.96,"against me than Terry, andthat's not trying to be"
702,00:48:57.12,00:48:57.12,"manipulative, but if you do voteTerry, then you lose me and"
703,00:48:59.83,00:48:59.83,Cirie anyways.>> All right.
704,00:49:12.25,00:49:12.25,>> I thought we were golden onceyou said we are.
705,00:49:15.04,00:49:15.04,">> We, we really, we pretty muchare."
706,00:49:17.08,00:49:17.08,">> Pretty much are?You can't, D, you can't do this"
707,00:49:20.12,00:49:20.12,to me.>> I need to go off by myself
708,00:49:22.04,00:49:22.04,"and just think about this.>> Either way, would you tell me"
709,00:49:24.46,00:49:24.46,either way so I don't go inlike an idiot?
710,00:49:26.67,00:49:26.67,">> Yes, yes, yes.>> And remember that you did"
711,00:49:29.08,00:49:29.08,give me your word when I was onthe lily pad.
712,00:49:31.17,00:49:31.17,">> I know, I know, I know.All right, I'll be back."
713,00:49:33.71,00:49:33.71,>> All right.>> Listening to Aras' sales
714,00:49:37.38,00:49:37.38,pitch was just mind-boggling.Aras is all about honesty and
715,00:49:41.83,00:49:41.83,"integrity, but, in the samesense, he's contradicting"
716,00:49:45.79,00:49:45.79,himself because he's basicallythreatening me.
717,00:49:48.46,00:49:48.46,">> You better bring me, I swearto God."
718,00:49:50.50,00:49:50.50,"I will be shocked if you don't,let's just say that."
719,00:49:53.92,00:49:53.92,>> All right. (groans)Part of Aras' sales pitch to me
720,00:49:58.92,00:49:58.92,"was that he would not vote forme if I took Terry, so I would"
721,00:50:02.33,00:50:02.33,"lose his vote and Cirie's vote,which I think is completely"
722,00:50:06.25,00:50:06.25,"messed up.Aras is very manipulative, so"
723,00:50:08.75,00:50:08.75,that's why I'm kinda hesitant totake him or even listen to what
724,00:50:14.21,00:50:14.21,he says because I want themillion dollars.
725,00:50:16.50,00:50:16.50,"I'm not gonna base my losing amillion dollars to, ""Oh,  told "
726,00:50:20.75,00:50:20.75,"Aras I would take him.""I'm gonna go with what I think."
727,00:50:24.04,00:50:24.04,This is how I've played thisgame so far and I believe that's
728,00:50:27.29,00:50:27.29,why I'm where I am right now.>> You know what?
729,00:50:46.33,00:50:46.33,"It's your decision to make.You won the thing today, so if"
730,00:50:49.62,00:50:49.62,"you think I'll be better totake, do that."
731,00:50:52.50,00:50:52.50,"If you think Aras would bebetter to take, do that."
732,00:50:54.88,00:50:54.88,">> Okay.>> Terry, regardless, man."
733,00:51:04.25,00:51:04.25,"It's been a pleasure.It's been a journey with you,"
734,00:51:07.75,00:51:07.75,man.Battle on.
735,00:51:37.33,00:51:37.33,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of the jury:
736,00:51:40.79,00:51:40.79,"Austin, Sally...Bruce, Courtney..."
737,00:51:47.12,00:51:47.12,Shane and Cirie.Let's talk about the final
738,00:51:57.17,00:51:57.17,"immunity challenge.The two big dogs, Terry and"
739,00:52:00.96,00:52:00.96,"Aras, don't come through,and Danielle, suddenly, you're"
740,00:52:05.12,00:52:05.12,sitting in the most enviableposition in this game.
741,00:52:07.62,00:52:07.62,How does it feel having thatimmunity necklace around you?
742,00:52:10.33,00:52:10.33,>> It feels great and it was anhonor to be able to win the most
743,00:52:15.04,00:52:15.04,"important challenge of theentire game, but the decision "
744,00:52:19.04,00:52:19.04,that I have to make tonight isone of the most difficult
745,00:52:22.29,00:52:22.29,"decisions I've probably, I willhave to make ever in my life."
746,00:52:26.46,00:52:26.46,It's like a scary feeling 'causeI'm not sure which way I want to
747,00:52:30.17,00:52:30.17,"go, and my brain is about toexplode out of my head."
748,00:52:33.08,00:52:33.08,So I just wanted them both tounderstand and respect where I'm
749,00:52:36.54,00:52:36.54,coming from and just don't hateme after this.
750,00:52:40.00,00:52:40.00,">> PROBST: Terry, you playedthis game as competitively as it"
751,00:52:44.67,00:52:44.67,can be played for 38 days.Are you able to respect the
752,00:52:48.25,00:52:48.25,position that Danielle's in?>> That part of not winning the
753,00:52:52.17,00:52:52.17,"last immunity challenge, it'sfrustrating to have come through"
754,00:52:55.08,00:52:55.08,this with both the hiddenimmunity idol and the necklace
755,00:52:57.92,00:52:57.92,most of the time.>> PROBST: So you did have the

757,00:53:03.12,00:53:03.12,"Had that the whole time.Uh, I can separate myself"
758,00:53:07.29,00:53:07.29,because I have to.It's a different part of the
759,00:53:09.79,00:53:09.79,game than the competition side.It's a number-crunching thing.
760,00:53:13.08,00:53:13.08,"You know, I think it's in mybetter interest and her better"
761,00:53:15.67,00:53:15.67,interest to go with my side.But it's now a mental thing for
762,00:53:20.17,00:53:20.17,"her to go through, but you know,do I want to go home tonight?"
763,00:53:23.75,00:53:23.75,"No stinking way.>> PROBST: Aras, you come up to"

771,00:53:48.79,00:53:48.79,"final two together.We have the best shot, and"
772,00:53:51.00,00:53:51.00,that's kinda how I threw it outthere.
773,00:53:52.71,00:53:52.71,">> PROBST: Danielle, as youthink about this more and more,"
774,00:53:56.00,00:53:56.00,does it get more and morecomplicated?
775,00:53:58.12,00:53:58.12,">> Yeah, it is.I just feel like crying."
776,00:54:01.29,00:54:01.29,"Like, right after you put thenecklace around my neck, I just"
777,00:54:05.21,00:54:05.21,started thinking about it and Ihaven't stopped since...

779,00:54:12.58,00:54:12.58,"I don't know.>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"

804,00:57:00.25,00:57:00.25,Back to camp. Good night.>> The biggest mistake I made
805,00:57:08.04,00:57:08.04,was not keeping the game in myown hands and then relying on
806,00:57:12.42,00:57:12.42,somebody else to take care of itfor me.
807,00:57:15.42,00:57:15.42,"That's what got me.But, uh, it was not bad for a"
808,00:57:18.79,00:57:18.79,46-year-old guy.And I hope I made my friends and
809,00:57:21.21,00:57:21.21,"family proud, and Terry Dietz isnot a perfect guy, and there's"
810,00:57:25.21,00:57:25.21,"always room for better change.>> Oh, my God. Final two."
811,00:57:44.71,00:57:44.71,"D, I'm so happy!We're the two youngest people in"

816,00:58:03.21,00:58:03.21,"Oh, my God, we did it, girl.>> We did it."
817,00:58:06.04,00:58:06.04,"Do you think they were shockedthat I picked Terry, or do you"
818,00:58:08.12,00:58:08.12,think they knew that?>> I think they knew that.
819,00:58:10.12,00:58:10.12,">> Yeah.>> Oh, come here."

827,00:58:37.21,00:58:37.21,">> Who would've thought, huh?>> The reason why I decided to"
828,00:58:39.58,00:58:39.58,take Aras is because Aras is apart of the former Casaya Tribe.
829,00:58:45.71,00:58:45.71,">> Whoa, everything must burn.For me at the end, to go ahead"
830,00:58:51.62,00:58:51.62,"and pick Terry over Aras, Ithink would've been a slap in"
831,00:58:55.62,00:58:55.62,"everybody's face.So, my gut choice was Aras."
832,00:58:59.75,00:58:59.75,That's just what it was and Iwent with it.
833,00:59:02.88,00:59:02.88,"That's what I've been doing thisentire game, and I think that's"

836,00:59:10.17,00:59:10.17,"Today would've been the hardestday to go home, I think,"
837,00:59:13.25,00:59:13.25,"'cause you're so close.>> Yeah, yeah."
838,00:59:15.38,00:59:15.38,My job isn't done yet.I'm still not satisfied.
839,00:59:18.33,00:59:18.33,"I'm in sales, so hopefully, Ican, uh, do some persuading to"
840,00:59:21.42,00:59:21.42,the jury and hope for the best.Because I want that million
841,00:59:26.12,00:59:26.12,"dollars, I don't want to settlefor anything less than first"

870,01:01:43.42,01:01:43.42,lightheaded.I thought I was going to faint.

872,01:02:08.04,01:02:08.04,>> I was a little nervouswhen Aras was saying he felt
873,01:02:10.04,01:02:10.04,"faint, you know, I was getting a little nervous, 'cause I saw"
874,01:02:12.92,01:02:12.92,all the blood.>> The thought of seeing blood
875,01:02:20.21,01:02:20.21,"scares me and to actually see itgushing out like it did, freaked"

895,01:03:51.04,01:03:51.04,I got my butt kicked by TerryDeitz a lot of the time.
896,01:03:54.04,01:03:54.04,I got my butt kicked by my ownshortsightedness-- falling down
897,01:03:57.29,01:03:57.29,on the rocks.Despite the fact that I made it
898,01:04:00.12,01:04:00.12,"39 days, I feel like my ego hasbeen crushed."
899,01:04:05.42,01:04:05.42,"I feel so stupid for falling.>> It's so funny, day 39 this"
900,01:04:25.83,01:04:25.83,happens.I just feel terrible.
901,01:04:29.92,01:04:29.92,>> Don't feel like that.It was an accident.
902,01:04:33.04,01:04:33.04,">> I wanted to, like, go out...cool thing and then I go out."
903,01:04:37.58,01:04:37.58,>> This day was definitely yourday.
904,01:04:41.17,01:04:41.17,>> My day to be a...I kind of came in as a buffoon
905,01:04:45.71,01:04:45.71,"and I kind of went out as abuffoon, and in between I did"
906,01:04:49.12,01:04:49.12,some pretty cool things.That's life.
907,01:04:52.71,01:04:52.71,"I mean, you fall, you get backup and you try again."
908,01:04:57.58,01:04:57.58,Sometimes you need to getstitched up before you can try
909,01:05:00.25,01:05:00.25,again.Falling down and hurting myself
910,01:05:05.12,01:05:05.12,"today reminded me just how humanI am, and reminded me just how"
911,01:05:08.88,01:05:08.88,"much of a game this is.What that is is saying, ""Look,"
912,01:05:12.96,01:05:12.96,"Aras, you don't have to be asuperman, you don't have to be a"
913,01:05:15.96,01:05:15.96,"superhero and you'll be okay.""And so, with that perspective,"
914,01:05:20.38,01:05:20.38,"coming into Tribal Council,maybe I'll be able to connect"
915,01:05:23.12,01:05:23.12,with people at a deeper level.That's the hope.
916,01:05:42.96,01:05:42.96,>> I can't really say there'sone thing that I've learned
917,01:05:46.17,01:05:46.17,about myself that I didn't knowcoming into this.
918,01:05:50.50,01:05:50.50,It just drew a clearer picturefor me.
919,01:05:54.04,01:05:54.04,"It let me know I'm strong,you know, I'm a strong,"
920,01:05:56.62,01:05:56.62,"independent woman, and I knew Icould get through it, and I did"
921,01:05:59.21,01:05:59.21,"it.I'm so proud of myself, I"
922,01:06:02.21,01:06:02.21,really am.I just hope people dig deep
923,01:06:06.08,01:06:06.08,tonight in the jury.I hope they pick the right
924,01:06:10.00,01:06:10.00,"person, being me.>> You all packed up?"
925,01:06:22.12,01:06:22.12,>> Yeah.It's like weird.
926,01:06:25.00,01:06:25.00,">> It is weird, isn't it?This is the last day."
927,01:06:29.62,01:06:29.62,"Come here, stand up, give me ahug."
928,01:06:33.46,01:06:33.46,"Oh, whatever happens tonight, D,I'm so happy I got to share this"
929,01:06:36.17,01:06:36.17,with you.This has been an amazing ride.
930,01:06:40.17,01:06:40.17,"And hopefully, there will be anamazing reward at the end of it."

986,01:10:19.25,01:10:19.25,"deceive somebody, and you justhave to make that decision"
987,01:10:22.04,01:10:22.04,whether it's the right time todo that.

1001,01:11:22.00,01:11:22.00,"yet, so I do have a questionthat I'm going to ask."
1002,01:11:25.08,01:11:25.08,Of the six original Casayamembers that you had such a
1003,01:11:28.12,01:11:28.12,strong connection with that Icould not for the life of me
1004,01:11:30.58,01:11:30.58,"figure out how to get into, ofthose six, who contributed the"
1005,01:11:34.46,01:11:34.46,most to why you're sittingthere?
1006,01:11:36.46,01:11:36.46,"Danielle, you can go first.>> Cirie would be the one"
1007,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,person that I would say is thereason why I'm sitting here.
1008,01:11:43.79,01:11:43.79,I just had a connection withher.
1009,01:11:45.62,01:11:45.62,I was at Exile six days out ofthe 39 days.
1010,01:11:49.12,01:11:49.12,"And when you come back fromExile Island, you don't know"
1011,01:11:51.17,01:11:51.17,"what's been going on, so Ialways had Cirie to fill me in,"
1012,01:11:55.46,01:11:55.46,and she did.And I always trusted her.
1013,01:11:59.79,01:11:59.79,>> Thank you.Aras.
1014,01:12:02.83,01:12:02.83,">> Ironically, I also would sayCirie."
1015,01:12:06.33,01:12:06.33,"One, just as a friend.You need to have somebody you"
1016,01:12:08.88,01:12:08.88,"can just relate to, and then atother times it's strategic."
1017,01:12:11.92,01:12:11.92,And we helped each other.We took each other on a reward.
1018,01:12:14.00,01:12:14.00,It was a mutually beneficialrelationship.
1019,01:12:17.04,01:12:17.04,"But I think if I had to singleout one person, Cirie would be"
1020,01:12:20.00,01:12:20.00,the person.>> Congratulations again.
1021,01:12:23.08,01:12:23.08,Thank you so much.>> PROBST: Bruce.

1024,01:12:35.79,01:12:35.79,of you.Now we have the responsibility
1025,01:12:38.08,01:12:38.08,of deciding who's going to getthat million dollars.
1026,01:12:41.79,01:12:41.79,"And what I want to know is,beyond the million dollars, if"
1027,01:12:44.88,01:12:44.88,"you were given that, what areyou going to be doing with that"
1028,01:12:48.54,01:12:48.54,responsibility?That's what I'd like to know.
1029,01:12:51.83,01:12:51.83,">> PROBST: Aras.>> To be honest, Bruce, I don't"
1030,01:12:54.50,01:12:54.50,know if I can inspire anybodyelse unless I change myself.
1031,01:12:58.38,01:12:58.38,"And so for me, my focus at theage that I am is really, like,"
1032,01:13:01.54,01:13:01.54,"can I make myself a betterperson, and hopefully, through"
1033,01:13:04.17,01:13:04.17,"that, that will inspire otherpeople."
1034,01:13:08.17,01:13:08.17,I don't know if that worked.>> PROBST: Danielle.
1035,01:13:10.88,01:13:10.88,">> I would love to just sharemy experiences, maybe just give"

1044,01:13:44.42,01:13:44.42,and having to do it sometimeduring the game is totally
1045,01:13:46.50,01:13:46.50,"off-base.After 38 days, I never came"
1046,01:13:49.42,01:13:49.42,"close to deceiving anyone.Somewhere down the line,"
1047,01:13:52.96,01:13:52.96,"Danielle, I hope that yourfamily and friends and the"
1048,01:13:57.12,01:13:57.12,"ringing in your ears doesn'tsay ""should have taken the navy"
1049,01:14:01.38,01:14:01.38,"guy.""Okay, the out-play portion of"

1051,01:14:09.04,01:14:09.04,"So what I want you to do israte yourself, one through ten,"
1052,01:14:13.08,01:14:13.08,and why you gave yourself a oneto ten rating.
1053,01:14:16.29,01:14:16.29,Aras.>> I give myself a nine.
1054,01:14:19.25,01:14:19.25,I busted my butt at everychallenge.
1055,01:14:21.17,01:14:21.17,"And I think everybody here did,basically."
1056,01:14:23.17,01:14:23.17,"I don't know anybody whowasn't, like, pumped up for a"
1057,01:14:25.00,01:14:25.00,"challenge, and I have noregrets about any of the"
1058,01:14:27.67,01:14:27.67,"challenges, except maybewishing I got a peg in"
1059,01:14:31.12,01:14:31.12,"somewhere quicker than somebodyelse got a peg in, or something"
1060,01:14:33.62,01:14:33.62,like that.>> Danielle.
1061,01:14:35.88,01:14:35.88,">> I would give myself an eightand a half, nine, only because"
1062,01:14:40.12,01:14:40.12,I would give myself higher if Ididn't take the cheeseburger
1063,01:14:44.04,01:14:44.04,over that challenge.I'm still kicking myself in the
1064,01:14:47.00,01:14:47.00,"ass for that.But every other challenge, I"
1065,01:14:50.46,01:14:50.46,put in 110% on that field.I just gave it my all.
1066,01:14:55.46,01:14:55.46,So I'd say closer to a nine.>> That's it.
1067,01:14:59.12,01:14:59.12,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Thank you, Terry."
1068,01:15:01.04,01:15:01.04,"Austin, you're up.>> First off, congratulations"

1071,01:15:13.12,01:15:13.12,want you to tell me oneincident you think you made a
1072,01:15:16.71,01:15:16.71,"very positive, good move, andthen one incident that you did"
1073,01:15:20.79,01:15:20.79,something that wasn'tnecessarily completely on the
1074,01:15:22.46,01:15:22.46,"up-and-up, both of which helpedyou kind of navigate your way to"
1075,01:15:25.21,01:15:25.21,where you are right now.>> PROBST: We'll start with
1076,01:15:28.33,01:15:28.33,Danielle.>> I think the first move that I
1077,01:15:32.04,01:15:32.04,did that helped me get somecontrol in this game was to
1078,01:15:34.62,01:15:34.62,persuade people not to voteBruce off and to vote Bob Dog
1079,01:15:39.04,01:15:39.04,off.I just feel like that was the
1080,01:15:40.67,01:15:40.67,first move where I gained alittle bit of control in the
1081,01:15:43.04,01:15:43.04,"game.And the second move, obviously,"
1082,01:15:46.25,01:15:46.25,"was voting Courtney off,because Courtney was one of the"
1083,01:15:50.17,01:15:50.17,closest people that I bondedwith here.
1084,01:15:54.17,01:15:54.17,That was one of the hardestthings I had to do.
1085,01:15:57.46,01:15:57.46,">> Okay, thanks.>> PROBST: Aras."
1086,01:16:01.50,01:16:01.50,>> Probably the...the move that I'm proudest I
1087,01:16:04.67,01:16:04.67,made was telling Melinda shewas going to be home.
1088,01:16:06.83,01:16:06.83,To be the second person votedoff and to not know you're
1089,01:16:08.92,01:16:08.92,going home...Like Shane didn't know if he was
1090,01:16:11.00,01:16:11.00,"going to stay or not, andMelinda's hopes got up."
1091,01:16:14.25,01:16:14.25,"But I felt good that she atleast knew she was going home,"
1092,01:16:16.71,01:16:16.71,as opposed to coming in likesuper-stoked that she was going
1093,01:16:19.38,01:16:19.38,to make it three more days andget blindsided.
1094,01:16:22.67,01:16:22.67,"Something that I wasn't so proudof: Shane, the vote off for"
1095,01:16:26.08,01:16:26.08,Shane.I had to break the alliance with
1096,01:16:28.25,01:16:28.25,Shane and I ended up sayingthings to Shane that weren't
1097,01:16:30.96,01:16:30.96,"true, and I felt bad about that.But I do think I played this"
1098,01:16:33.88,01:16:33.88,"game with lots of integrity,and for the most part, every"
1099,01:16:36.38,01:16:36.38,"move I made, I felt really goodabout."
1100,01:16:39.38,01:16:39.38,>> Congratulations again to theboth of you guys.
1101,01:16:41.67,01:16:41.67,">> PROBST: Thanks, Austin.Courtney."
1102,01:16:44.38,01:16:44.38,">> Oh, boy!I forgot my guns."
1103,01:16:52.75,01:16:52.75,They've been dropped in the seaof forgiveness.
1104,01:16:55.79,01:16:55.79,Whew!Wow!
1105,01:16:58.67,01:16:58.67,I came in here wanting to playwith integrity and to be of
1106,01:17:02.79,01:17:02.79,"light and love and this shiningbeing, and, wow, did I struggle"
1107,01:17:07.04,01:17:07.04,with that.Because you certainly both
1108,01:17:10.12,01:17:10.12,"stabbed me in the back with aknife that was very deep, and"
1109,01:17:13.33,01:17:13.33,it took me about a week toremove it from my back it was
1110,01:17:16.75,01:17:16.75,"so deep, especially fromDanielle, who, which I had"
1111,01:17:20.46,01:17:20.46,total trust in her.I never was going to vote you
1112,01:17:22.92,01:17:22.92,out.I don't know who made up that
1113,01:17:24.58,01:17:24.58,"lie, but I'm holding no chip onmy shoulder, because chips on"
