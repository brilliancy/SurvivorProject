2,00:00:10.00,00:00:10.00,Americans set foot on a small remote island off the
3,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,coast of Panama... Welcome to Survivor.
4,00:00:15.71,00:00:15.71,"In a new social experiment, they were split into four tribes:"
5,00:00:19.62,00:00:19.62,"the younger men, the younger women, the older men and the"
6,00:00:23.00,00:00:23.00,"older women. And in a new twist, this"
7,00:00:25.96,00:00:25.96,isolated isle would become a looming force in the strategy of
8,00:00:29.75,00:00:29.75,the game. This is Exile Island.
9,00:00:32.08,00:00:32.08,"Throughout this game, tribe members will be banished to this"
10,00:00:35.25,00:00:35.25,"island. Go! In the first challenge, the"
11,00:00:37.54,00:00:37.54,young women finish last and chose Misty to stay behind on
12,00:00:41.21,00:00:41.21,Exile Island... >> I'm here.
13,00:00:42.83,00:00:42.83,>> PROBST: ...and a secret was revealed.
14,00:00:44.75,00:00:44.75,Hidden on this island is an immunity idol.
15,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,"Along the way, you'll be given clues as to the whereabouts"
16,00:00:51.17,00:00:51.17,"of that idol. >> Okay, here we go kids."
17,00:00:55.58,00:00:55.58,>> PROBST: The two older tribes fared well.
18,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,>> That's the best stinking fire I've seen in a long time.
19,00:01:00.83,00:01:00.83,>> PROBST: The two younger tribes floundered.
20,00:01:03.71,00:01:03.71,">> That's a shelter right there, gentleman."
21,00:01:05.38,00:01:05.38,>> That is the sorriest shelter I think we could have possibly
22,00:01:08.17,00:01:08.17,come up with. >> PROBST: Misty failed to find
23,00:01:10.17,00:01:10.17,the hidden idol on Exile Island and rejoined her tribe...
24,00:01:14.12,00:01:14.12,Young women doing a good job. ...to play for immunity.
25,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,(cheering) Older women going to Tribal
26,00:01:21.50,00:01:21.50,Council! Cirie immediately undertook a
27,00:01:25.54,00:01:25.54,bold plan to get the most productive of the older women
28,00:01:28.58,00:01:28.58,ousted. >> I'm gonna try to get rid of
29,00:01:32.04,00:01:32.04,the lumberjack lady. First person voted out of
30,00:01:34.83,00:01:34.83,Survivor: Exile Island... The plan worked and Tina was the
31,00:01:37.79,00:01:37.79,first to be voted out. The tribe has spoken.
32,00:01:42.21,00:01:42.21,"From the beginning, the experience of survival took its"
33,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,toll. >> I smoked three packs of
34,00:01:50.29,00:01:50.29,"cigarettes a day for 20 years, and I haven't had a cigarette"
35,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,"in, like, 31 hours. I don't know why I did this to"
36,00:01:56.88,00:01:56.88,myself. >> Green sweats.
37,00:01:58.62,00:01:58.62,>> PROBST: In a schoolyard pick...
38,00:02:00.21,00:02:00.21,>> Cool guy. ...that brought new hope.
39,00:02:01.67,00:02:01.67,>> The cool guy. >> PROBST: ...the four tribes
40,00:02:03.25,00:02:03.25,became two: La Mina and Casaya. >> Terry makes an unbelievable
41,00:02:10.25,00:02:10.25,catch! La Mina enjoyed an early winning
42,00:02:13.29,00:02:13.29,streak. La Mina wins immunity!
43,00:02:15.96,00:02:15.96,"Casaya, Tribal Council tonight. It's gonna cost you a member."
44,00:02:19.17,00:02:19.17,"Before Casaya went to Tribal  Council, Shane wanted to quit."
45,00:02:23.75,00:02:23.75,>> I'm gonna quit. I have to quit.
46,00:02:25.67,00:02:25.67,>> PROBST: But Aras managed to change his mind.
47,00:02:27.38,00:02:27.38,">> Just try it, okay? >> All right."
48,00:02:29.25,00:02:29.25,>> PROBST: With Shane back in the fold...
49,00:02:31.17,00:02:31.17,">> You guys, now we have to talk about who we're gonna vote off."
50,00:02:33.79,00:02:33.79,"I just want to do this with honesty and, like, openness."
51,00:02:36.46,00:02:36.46,>> PROBST: ...it became clear that Melinda and Cirie were
52,00:02:38.92,00:02:38.92,doomed. >> I don't care which one of you
53,00:02:41.12,00:02:41.12,"goes. Like, whoever doesn't go now is"
54,00:02:43.29,00:02:43.29,going next. >> PROBST: Melinda went first...
55,00:02:45.17,00:02:45.17,"Melinda, the tribe has spoken. ...and Cirie's situation seemed"
56,00:02:49.21,00:02:49.21,hopeless. >> I'm walking on egg shells as
57,00:02:51.58,00:02:51.58,it is. I was told I'd be the next to
58,00:02:54.00,00:02:54.00,go. You were right. >> PROBST: But her social skills
59,00:02:56.17,00:02:56.17,and patience would take her far as she sat back and watched
60,00:02:59.54,00:02:59.54,Casaya fall apart. >> Why are you so sensitive?!
61,00:03:03.54,00:03:03.54,>> PROBST: Shane was usually the catalyst for drama at Casaya.
62,00:03:06.96,00:03:06.96,>> Everybody here won't tell you because they're afraid to tell
63,00:03:10.00,00:03:10.00,you the truth! I want one! This one!
64,00:03:12.71,00:03:12.71,"I just want mine! >> It's just constant, constant"
65,00:03:16.08,00:03:16.08,"drama. I love it, love it, love it,"
66,00:03:18.04,00:03:18.04,yes! >> Right there!
67,00:03:20.12,00:03:20.12,>> PROBST: But the dysfunctional Casaya enjoyed an impressive
68,00:03:22.50,00:03:22.50,five-challenge winning streak. Casaya wins immunity!
69,00:03:27.38,00:03:27.38,And La Mina lost Misty and Ruth Marie.
70,00:03:31.00,00:03:31.00,"Casaya sent Terry to Exile Island, and he quickly turned"
71,00:03:34.33,00:03:34.33,banishment into a position of power.
72,00:03:37.04,00:03:37.04,">> ""This talisman can be used to keep you safe from"
73,00:03:39.29,00:03:39.29,"the vote at Tribal Council."" All right!"
74,00:03:43.00,00:03:43.00,>> PROBST: His possession of the idol-- or the suspicion that he
75,00:03:45.88,00:03:45.88,might have it-- would affect the nature of the game up to the
76,00:03:48.58,00:03:48.58,"very end. Terry, Danielle diving in."
77,00:03:50.92,00:03:50.92,And Terry's luck continued when La Mina managed to win the next
78,00:03:54.00,00:03:54.00,immunity challenge. La Mina wins immunity!
79,00:03:58.58,00:03:58.58,"Bruce was in serious danger of being chopped from Casaya, but"
80,00:04:02.21,00:04:02.21,"Danielle made a power play. >> Courtney, why don't we switch"
81,00:04:05.08,00:04:05.08,this game up right now? I wanted Bruce to stay and I
82,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,wanted Bobby to go. >> PROBST: Bruce was saved and
83,00:04:11.25,00:04:11.25,Bobby took the fall. The tribe has spoken.
84,00:04:15.17,00:04:15.17,>> That's it. That's it. >> PROBST: Casaya was able to
85,00:04:17.12,00:04:17.12,make a comeback. Casaya wins immunity!
86,00:04:20.04,00:04:20.04,"And at Tribal Council, Dan was voted out."
87,00:04:23.79,00:04:23.79,"The tribe has spoken. On day 16, Casaya had the"
88,00:04:28.29,00:04:28.29,advantage in numbers; six to La Mina's four.
89,00:04:32.12,00:04:32.12,>> There they are. >> PROBST: And when the Casaya
90,00:04:33.71,00:04:33.71,six saw La Mina approaching for the merge...
91,00:04:35.67,00:04:35.67,">> Hey, come here quickly. >> PROBST: ...they circled up"
92,00:04:38.00,00:04:38.00,"against them. >> We stay together, we'll get"
93,00:04:39.58,00:04:39.58,"to the top six. One, two, three, win."
94,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,Come on in. >> PROBST: Terry did his best to
95,00:04:44.04,00:04:44.04,get someone from Casaya to flop. >> You might be on the chopping
96,00:04:47.08,00:04:47.08,block. Come over and we will go to the
97,00:04:49.25,00:04:49.25,final five. Our group of four would like to
98,00:04:51.54,00:04:51.54,offer you more time of worry- free life around here.
99,00:04:54.04,00:04:54.04,>> PROBST: But nobody from Casaya would budge...
100,00:04:55.96,00:04:55.96,>> It was almost laughable. I don't think he's in a position
101,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,to offer me anything. >> PROBST: ...so his only option
102,00:05:01.79,00:05:01.79,was individual immunity. Terry wins the first individual
103,00:05:05.67,00:05:05.67,"immunity. And in an amazing feat, Terry"
104,00:05:08.29,00:05:08.29,the fighter pilot continued to dominate at the individual
105,00:05:11.12,00:05:11.12,challenges. With Terry perpetually safe from
106,00:05:14.88,00:05:14.88,the vote and with the hidden immunity idol in his back
107,00:05:17.54,00:05:17.54,"pocket, the other former La Mina tribe mates were picked off one"
108,00:05:21.00,00:05:21.00,by one. Nick.
109,00:05:22.71,00:05:22.71,Austin. Sally.
110,00:05:24.50,00:05:24.50,Terry was the last La Mina member standing.
111,00:05:27.17,00:05:27.17,"On day 25, a prickly reward challenge revealed what the"
112,00:05:31.54,00:05:31.54,tribe really thought of each other.
113,00:05:33.92,00:05:33.92,"""Who is the most annoying person out here?"""
114,00:05:37.25,00:05:37.25,"Everybody says ""Courtney."" >> God!"
115,00:05:39.25,00:05:39.25,>> PROBST: But Courtney's unpopularity made her a popular
116,00:05:41.46,00:05:41.46,"candidate for the final two. >> If I need your vote, would"
117,00:05:45.12,00:05:45.12,you trust me and not break my back?
118,00:05:46.79,00:05:46.79,">> You know, I want to be on your back side and I would like"
119,00:05:49.62,00:05:49.62,you to be on mine. >> Okay. She is a dream to
120,00:05:51.96,00:05:51.96,take to the final two. Anyone could win against her.
121,00:05:55.00,00:05:55.00,"(groans) >> PROBST: On day 25, Bruce's"
122,00:05:57.58,00:05:57.58,internal pain became a medical emergency.
123,00:06:00.29,00:06:00.29,>> Bruce? You allergic to  anything?
124,00:06:02.04,00:06:02.04,(gasps) >> PROBST: He was evacuated and
125,00:06:04.00,00:06:04.00,forced to leave the game. Terry continued to hang on with
126,00:06:09.21,00:06:09.21,all his might. (gasps)
127,00:06:11.62,00:06:11.62,Terry wins his fourth straight immunity.
128,00:06:15.62,00:06:15.62,>> I am totally motivated to kick their butts at everything
129,00:06:18.04,00:06:18.04,that comes down the road. I'm gonna have to take you to
130,00:06:20.75,00:06:20.75,"the bank the whole time. >> If you do that, man, hats'"
131,00:06:23.92,00:06:23.92,off. >> PROBST: And he stayed true
132,00:06:25.33,00:06:25.33,to his word. Terry wins immunity for the
133,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,fifth straight time! The day of reckoning finally
134,00:06:32.25,00:06:32.25,came when the former Casayas were forced to turn on one of
135,00:06:35.29,00:06:35.29,"their own, and Shane targeted Danielle."
136,00:06:38.17,00:06:38.17,>> We're gonna vote off Danielle.
137,00:06:40.17,00:06:40.17,>> But then there's still Courtney.
138,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,"It'll be me, you and Courtney. >> Right."
139,00:06:43.38,00:06:43.38,>> PROBST: Shane's plan made Cirie suspicious.
140,00:06:46.33,00:06:46.33,">> If he can take Courtney to the final two, he just may win"
141,00:06:49.21,00:06:49.21,a million dollars. So Courtney's going.
142,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,">> PROBST: And at Tribal Council, Cirie's scheme took"
143,00:06:54.17,00:06:54.17,"Courtney out of the equation. Courtney, the tribe has spoken."
144,00:06:57.92,00:06:57.92,"With the former Casaya bond finally broken, it became"
145,00:07:01.17,00:07:01.17,every man for himself. Terry and Shane banded together
146,00:07:05.42,00:07:05.42,in another attempt to oust Danielle.
147,00:07:09.71,00:07:09.71,>> She's depressed because she knows she's next.
148,00:07:11.50,00:07:11.50,>> PROBST: And they were confident they would be
149,00:07:13.50,00:07:13.50,"successful. >> I feel like, at this point, I"
150,00:07:15.33,00:07:15.33,could beat anybody. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
151,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,Council... The 12th person voted out of
152,00:07:19.21,00:07:19.21,Survivor: Exile Island. Shane was completely blindsided
153,00:07:22.96,00:07:22.96,"by Cirie, Aras and Danielle. >> Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a"
154,00:07:26.71,00:07:26.71,"chocolate ice cream bar in about one, I mean, one minute!"
155,00:07:31.08,00:07:31.08,">> PROBST: Shane, the tribe has spoken."
156,00:07:34.50,00:07:34.50,"...leaving Aras, Danielle, Terry and Cirie as the final four."
157,00:07:40.62,00:07:40.62,"Go! At the next reward challenge,"
158,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,the rivalry between Terry and Aras got physical.
159,00:07:45.75,00:07:45.75,"Whoa! Easy, guys! Two battering rams!"
160,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,And when Aras won the reward... Aras wins reward!
161,00:07:54.25,00:07:54.25,>> Yes! >> PROBST: ...things got
162,00:07:55.54,00:07:55.54,personal. >> The first time out we we were
163,00:07:57.38,00:07:57.38,only allowed one pass. >> PROBST: Yes.
164,00:07:59.12,00:07:59.12,">> Terry, every time somebody else wins, are you gonna say you"
165,00:08:01.33,00:08:01.33,got hosed? >> Keep it up. Just keep it up.
166,00:08:03.21,00:08:03.21,">> PROBST: For the reward, Aras chose Cirie to join him on a"
167,00:08:06.54,00:08:06.54,luxury yacht. >> Hopefully both of us making
168,00:08:08.83,00:08:08.83,"final three. >> Final two. What, are you"
169,00:08:10.96,00:08:10.96,"joking? >> Yeah, final two."
170,00:08:12.04,00:08:12.04,>> PROBST: Danielle and Terry were both sent to Exile Island
171,00:08:15.38,00:08:15.38,where they made their own pact to the final two.
172,00:08:18.00,00:08:18.00,>> I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win the million
173,00:08:21.04,00:08:21.04,dollars. It's the right time to align
174,00:08:23.12,00:08:23.12,myself with Terry. >> PROBST: At the immunity
175,00:08:25.71,00:08:25.71,challenge... Go!
176,00:08:26.88,00:08:26.88,"...all four fought hard to piece together a win, but Aras came"
177,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,away victorious. Aras wins immunity!
178,00:08:33.58,00:08:33.58,First time somebody other than Terry is wearing individual
179,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,immunity. With Aras immune and Terry in
180,00:08:39.08,00:08:39.08,"possession of the hidden idol,  Danielle and Cirie knew it could"
181,00:08:42.08,00:08:42.08,be a tricky Tribal Council. >> Probably Aras and Cirie are
182,00:08:46.00,00:08:46.00,"gonna vote me, and then me and Terry would vote Cirie."
183,00:08:49.54,00:08:49.54,So I think me and you are going up against something tonight?
184,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,">> Probably fire. >> You know the technique,"
185,00:08:55.50,00:08:55.50,right? >> PROBST: With the possibility
186,00:08:57.08,00:08:57.08,"of a tie vote looming, Terry and Aras coach their allies in"
187,00:09:00.33,00:09:00.33,fire-making. >> Just take the flint and
188,00:09:02.58,00:09:02.58,"you... >> PROBST: Meanwhile, Danielle"
189,00:09:05.17,00:09:05.17,still pushed Terry to give her his hidden immunity idol.
190,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,">> If I have two and she has two, I think it doesn't matter"
191,00:09:10.96,00:09:10.96,if you have the idol. >> It's a huge gamble.

222,00:12:15.21,00:12:15.21,through that rope. Just putting more coconut husk
223,00:12:18.33,00:12:18.33,on it may not be enough. Now it's Danielle who has flame.
224,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,Danielle has a big flame. Is it enough to burn through
225,00:12:29.25,00:12:29.25,the rope? Danielle blowing on it to keep

229,00:12:46.29,00:12:46.29,Can she figure out how to build it?

233,00:12:56.29,00:12:56.29,Danielle's is still going. Danielle has a nice little fire

256,00:15:04.17,00:15:04.17,expectations. I hope that my family is proud.
257,00:15:08.29,00:15:08.29,"Sorry, guys, I let you down. I couldn't get the fire going."
258,00:15:12.00,00:15:12.00,But I feel like I can still hold my head up high.
259,00:15:14.67,00:15:14.67,So I'm extremely proud to be out on day 36.
260,00:15:38.50,00:15:38.50,>> I was determined to not go home tonight at Tribal Council.
261,00:15:43.42,00:15:43.42,>> Whoa! >> I was just so happy that I
262,00:15:45.67,00:15:45.67,got it together and I got my fire going.
263,00:15:49.08,00:15:49.08,"And I won, and I'm ecstatic right now."
264,00:15:52.62,00:15:52.62,I'm so happy. >> Feed it a little bit of
265,00:15:55.54,00:15:55.54,straw. I'm going to get more straw.
266,00:15:59.08,00:15:59.08,"I've been extremely happy since Tribal Council, period, when"
267,00:16:03.08,00:16:03.08,Danielle won. Danielle and I have a pact so
268,00:16:07.62,00:16:07.62,"that if either one of us wins, we'll take the other one to the"
269,00:16:09.75,00:16:09.75,final. So we have a 66% chance of
270,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,getting to the final. So we're totally stoked about
271,00:16:15.75,00:16:15.75,"that, and we're happy. Danielle and I are going to"
272,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,"take it to Aras, and we're going to go to the final."
273,00:16:38.58,00:16:38.58,">> There you go, it's got Shane hair."
274,00:16:40.75,00:16:40.75,"This idol is worth about 25 cents right now, I think, in a"
275,00:16:43.54,00:16:43.54,pawn shop or something. It's not worth very much.
276,00:16:47.00,00:16:47.00,"But yeah, but that's it for the hidden immunity idol."
277,00:16:49.21,00:16:49.21,"It's no longer a part of this game, and I got enough wins"
278,00:16:53.17,00:16:53.17,under my belt where I didn't have to use it.
279,00:16:56.04,00:16:56.04,"He had some jingly stuff on it, but I didn't think I could"
280,00:16:59.21,00:16:59.21,hide it very well. >> Yeah.
281,00:17:01.58,00:17:01.58,">> I flattened it out right away, and I kept it in my pants"
282,00:17:06.46,00:17:06.46,pocket all the time. >> You didn't bring that last
283,00:17:08.83,00:17:08.83,"night? >> Oh, yeah."
284,00:17:10.12,00:17:10.12,>> You did bring it? >> It was in my shorts.
285,00:17:11.67,00:17:11.67,>> Oh. >> It's not that bad-looking of
286,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,"a guy. >> I thought it was, like, a"
287,00:17:16.00,00:17:16.00,rabbit's foot. >> Mm-hmm.
288,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,">> Aras and I were sitting by the fire, and Terry just kind of"
289,00:17:21.75,00:17:21.75,"took the hidden immunity idol and waved it in Aras' face, and"
290,00:17:25.17,00:17:25.17,I think Terry did that just to... another like strike
291,00:17:27.54,00:17:27.54,"at Aras, you know, like ha-ha, I had the hidden immunity idol."
292,00:17:30.79,00:17:30.79,"Ha-ha, I'm the bigger man. >> Aw, suck."
293,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,"Look at that, almost all the way through."
294,00:17:39.42,00:17:39.42,>> Aras and Terry's relationship is based on
295,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,rivalry. It's just that macho thing.
296,00:17:49.62,00:17:49.62,"I'm definitely caught in the middle between, you know, these"
297,00:17:52.79,00:17:52.79,two guys that have this testosterone match every day--
298,00:17:57.58,00:17:57.58,"who can catch the biggest fish, the most fish."
299,00:18:00.71,00:18:00.71,Who can beat who? Who's better?
300,00:18:03.08,00:18:03.08,Who's the tough guy? They just... they go back and
301,00:18:05.62,00:18:05.62,forth all the time. >> Dude!
302,00:18:10.33,00:18:10.33,>> Catch one? >> Five small ones.
303,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,One kind of medium and four small.
304,00:18:15.33,00:18:15.33,>> The bad news is that I caught freaking huge ones.
305,00:18:18.71,00:18:18.71,>> No! All right!
306,00:18:22.17,00:18:22.17,">> Oh, beautiful! >> Oh, man!"
307,00:18:24.50,00:18:24.50,">> Wait, wait, wait. >> Giving us the silent"
308,00:18:26.29,00:18:26.29,"treatment! Oh, very nice."
309,00:18:30.50,00:18:30.50,">> Good job, Aras! >> That rocks, man!"
310,00:18:33.08,00:18:33.08,Fish feast. Look at the teeth on that
311,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,"parrot fish. >> Terry and Aras, deep down"
312,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,"inside, we all know that they don't like each other."
313,00:18:52.04,00:18:52.04,>> Eyeball socket. >> The fact that Aras beat out
314,00:18:56.75,00:18:56.75,"Terry in the past two challenges, Terry's ready for"
315,00:19:00.79,00:19:00.79,revenge. I can see it.
316,00:19:03.88,00:19:03.88,So Aras better give him a run for his money at the
317,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,"immunity challenge, or else Aras will be going home."
318,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,">> PROBST: Come in, guys. How's it going, guys?"
319,00:19:29.83,00:19:29.83,">> Awesome. >> Hey, Jeff."

322,00:19:37.08,00:19:37.08,"know you were probably expecting an immunity challenge, but"
323,00:19:39.67,00:19:39.67,"instead, today you are playing for reward."
324,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,"For today's challenge, you will race to the top of a"

328,00:19:56.25,00:19:56.25,"When you get to the end of the maze, you'll release a bag"
329,00:19:59.25,00:19:59.25,with your first two pegs. You'll then move to a spinning

334,00:20:15.38,00:20:15.38,You will use the pegs to help you get to the top of the wall.
335,00:20:19.04,00:20:19.04,"Once you reach the top, place each of the four pegs in their"
336,00:20:23.54,00:20:23.54,individual finish slots. That will raise the flag.
337,00:20:27.92,00:20:27.92,First person to raise their flag wins reward.
338,00:20:30.29,00:20:30.29,Want to know what you're playing for?
339,00:20:31.79,00:20:31.79,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.

360,00:21:51.38,00:21:51.38,He's untying them. Danielle still struggling.
361,00:21:58.08,00:21:58.08,Terry back on track. Terry's dropped his first bag.
362,00:22:06.29,00:22:06.29,Aras moving on to the spinning wheel.

383,00:23:35.42,00:23:35.42,"His shirt saves him. Aras, hanging from his shirt."
384,00:23:38.92,00:23:38.92,"Terry, trying to make up some ground."
385,00:23:41.71,00:23:41.71,"Terry, digging in. Terry and Aras, neck and neck."
386,00:23:46.79,00:23:46.79,"Aras, to the top. He's got three pegs; he needs"
387,00:23:49.12,00:23:49.12,his last one. Aras frees his last peg.
388,00:23:53.71,00:23:53.71,"Aras, to the top. Terry, right behind him, to the"
389,00:23:56.25,00:23:56.25,top. Got to get 'em in.
390,00:23:58.25,00:23:58.25,"Four slots, got to get all four in and drop your flag."
391,00:24:01.04,00:24:01.04,"It's Aras. Terry, making up ground."
392,00:24:03.04,00:24:03.04,Terry comes from behind to win reward.
393,00:24:07.54,00:24:07.54,">> You are the ultimate competitor, man, ultimate."
394,00:24:10.17,00:24:10.17,"I'm telling you, you work me. >> PROBST: Wow. Incredible."

397,00:24:28.00,00:24:28.00,guys. Terry came out on top.
398,00:24:30.58,00:24:30.58,The good news is because the hidden immunity idol is no
399,00:24:33.12,00:24:33.12,"longer in play, nobody going to Exile Island."
400,00:24:35.92,00:24:35.92,"Aras, Danielle, grab your stuff. Head back to camp."
401,00:24:39.17,00:24:39.17,">> Congrats. >> PROBST: Terry, you got some"
402,00:24:49.04,00:24:49.04,"eating to do. Get your stuff, go."
403,00:25:13.79,00:25:13.79,">> Terry's probably eating something a little bit nicer,"
404,00:25:16.62,00:25:16.62,"but, uh, you know what? This is food, and, uh, we've"
405,00:25:19.79,00:25:19.79,been luck today; we've eaten a lot.
406,00:25:22.58,00:25:22.58,"This is going to be our seventh fish, three of them, pretty"
407,00:25:25.50,00:25:25.50,"big-size fish. So don't get me wrong, Terry's"
408,00:25:28.46,00:25:28.46,"grubbing and he's happy about it, and that's great for Terry,"
409,00:25:30.92,00:25:30.92,but this is great for Aras and Danielle right now too.
410,00:25:37.12,00:25:37.12,">> D, one of us has to win tomorrow, if one of us wants"
411,00:25:39.46,00:25:39.46,to win a million dollars. >> Tomorrow's gonna be like a

415,00:26:12.67,00:26:12.67,">> You know what? It was, uh, it was good."
416,00:26:15.50,00:26:15.50,"It wasn't like a crap-load of food, but it was all good."
417,00:26:19.54,00:26:19.54,">> What'd you get? >> Uh, a whole bunch of steamed"
418,00:26:23.54,00:26:23.54,"vegetables, like, uh, cauliflower, carrots, string"
419,00:26:26.83,00:26:26.83,"beans, spinach, and then two chicken breasts, a big thing of"
420,00:26:31.83,00:26:31.83,"rice and two pieces of multigrain bread, like, about 32"
421,00:26:35.79,00:26:35.79,ounces of water and then about a 16-ounce protein drink.
422,00:26:39.29,00:26:39.29,"That was it. Oh, and I had a banana, that"
423,00:26:42.12,00:26:42.12,"was it. >> Oh, yum."
424,00:26:44.25,00:26:44.25,">> But, um... that was it. >> Thank you."
425,00:26:54.50,00:26:54.50,>> There's absolutely an advantage to having a meal the
426,00:26:56.88,00:26:56.88,day before the biggest immunity challenge of the game.

431,00:27:16.54,00:27:16.54,"you've got all this food in your body, that kind of puts the"
432,00:27:19.08,00:27:19.08,pressure on a little bit for Terry.
433,00:27:29.29,00:27:29.29,">> I hope I have it, I hope I'm here for two nights."
434,00:27:39.42,00:27:39.42,>> I think you'll have to fight Danielle for that.
435,00:27:42.29,00:27:42.29,>> I don't think Terry's apparent dominance has a
436,00:27:44.08,00:27:44.08,"psychological effect on me, personally."
437,00:27:46.62,00:27:46.62,Everybody and their mother expects Terry to win this
438,00:27:49.00,00:27:49.00,"next immunity challenge. So I go out there, I give it my"

440,00:27:55.79,00:27:55.79,"I gave it my best. If I do win, beautiful."

467,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,"experience all around. I learned a lot about myself,"

489,00:31:42.29,00:31:42.29,It was fun! This game was energizing
490,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,spiritually. It was very hard physically.

499,00:32:22.33,00:32:22.33,I had no idea coming out here how hard it was going to be.

501,00:32:27.21,00:32:27.21,"game of Survivor, and that honor is just magnified by having a"

503,00:32:35.67,00:32:35.67,with a million bucks. >> Survivor Sal.
504,00:32:40.96,00:32:40.96,>> It was fun having Sally around camp.
505,00:32:44.17,00:32:44.17,"She's a real sweetheart, a real genuine girl."
506,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,>> My Survivor experience was everything I could've imagined
507,00:32:52.88,00:32:52.88,"or hoped, and then to say, I made it to the final eight was"

510,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,"of the smallest and the oldest person, but I've always been"

512,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,"last-picked all the time, and so I just relish that kind of"
513,00:33:23.25,00:33:23.25,challenge to prove people wrong. The hardest part was getting
514,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,sick and being sick for days. And that was probably the most
515,00:33:30.42,00:33:30.42,"excruciating pain in my life, but that made me think a lot and"
516,00:33:33.21,00:33:33.21,"I felt, uh, coming off the island, I was a much stronger"
517,00:33:35.75,00:33:35.75,person. >> Courtney.

521,00:33:52.58,00:33:52.58,"it, and I did the best that I could."
522,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,I stayed the real me throughout it all.
523,00:33:59.54,00:33:59.54,You know what? I'm not going to be handed a
524,00:34:01.25,00:34:01.25,"million dollars, but I'm going to make it on my own."

528,00:34:23.29,00:34:23.29,"And there are so many things that I have learned about me,"
529,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,"about what I'm capable of, about what I can do, which is"
530,00:34:29.75,00:34:29.75,anything. And that's only going to make me
531,00:34:33.33,00:34:33.33,a stronger and more effective person to the planet.
532,00:34:37.04,00:34:37.04,And I'm going to remember this experience forever.

535,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,"life-changing experience for me, just in the fact that I"
536,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,won't be as fearful of the unknown.
537,00:34:58.08,00:34:58.08,Because that's what kind of kept me on the couch.
538,00:35:01.92,00:35:01.92,"Hopefully, it won't be as big a part of my life anymore, being"
539,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,that I've overcome a lot of things that I would have never

545,00:36:49.50,00:36:49.50,"us, is the burning of the skull, knowing that none of us"

553,00:37:14.96,00:37:14.96,the four platforms. Every 15 minutes you'll move to
554,00:37:18.21,00:37:18.21,"the next smallest platform. As the platform gets smaller,"
555,00:37:21.88,00:37:21.88,it will get tougher to keep your balance.

557,00:37:27.04,00:37:27.04,limit. We will go until there's only
558,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,one person left. Here are the rules: only your
559,00:37:31.50,00:37:31.50,feet can touch the platform. If your hands or your bottom
560,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,"touch the platform, you're out. If you fall off, you're out."

567,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, we'll get"
568,00:37:58.33,00:37:58.33,started. Everybody step onto your first
569,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,platform and get your balance. This challenge has begun.
570,00:38:18.88,00:38:18.88,15 minutes on this first platform.
571,00:38:28.67,00:38:28.67,"How you feeling, Terry? Doing all right, Danielle?"
572,00:38:32.88,00:38:32.88,Aras? Nobody wants to talk.
573,00:38:38.12,00:38:38.12,I understand. This challenge requires intense
574,00:38:42.21,00:38:42.21,concentration. Lose your focus for just a
575,00:38:45.38,00:38:45.38,"moment, you'll be in the water. We're now at the ten minute"
576,00:39:00.92,00:39:00.92,mark. Five more minutes on this
577,00:39:02.88,00:39:02.88,"platform, we move to the next one."
578,00:39:05.71,00:39:05.71,Terry's looking very strong. Aras has not moved.
579,00:39:09.96,00:39:09.96,Danielle's very steady. >> There's tons of fish on the
580,00:39:12.29,00:39:12.29,bottom. Should have had a drop line
581,00:39:14.33,00:39:14.33,with us. >> PROBST: You want to put your
582,00:39:16.12,00:39:16.12,"drop line in here? >> Yeah, I see some huge fish."
583,00:39:21.62,00:39:21.62,">> PROBST: Even in the middle of a challenge, Danielle"
584,00:39:23.92,00:39:23.92,thinking about food. >> (laughs)
585,00:39:32.29,00:39:32.29,>> PROBST: 15 seconds left in this round.
586,00:39:39.17,00:39:39.17,"Five, four, three, two, one. Crawl onto your next platform."
587,00:39:46.17,00:39:46.17,Find a new balance point. You have one minute.
588,00:39:50.46,00:39:50.46,"This will be a little more difficult, less room."
589,00:39:54.08,00:39:54.08,You'll feel the effects of the water more.
590,00:40:07.25,00:40:07.25,Everybody's up. Challenge is back on.
591,00:40:30.08,00:40:30.08,"You're eight minutes in, over halfway."
592,00:40:38.12,00:40:38.12,"Aras wobbling just a bit, but recovering."
593,00:40:42.12,00:40:42.12,Danielle very steady. Terry very steady.
594,00:40:50.21,00:40:50.21,"15 seconds left in this round. Three, two, one."
595,00:40:57.54,00:40:57.54,Crawl to your third platform. This is where you will begin to
596,00:41:01.21,00:41:01.21,notice a significant increase in difficulty.
597,00:41:05.58,00:41:05.58,You have one minute to get into a standing position.
598,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,45 seconds left. Nobody panicking.
599,00:41:31.54,00:41:31.54,"Everybody taking their time. That's it, Aras."
600,00:41:34.58,00:41:34.58,"Aras is up. That's it, Terry."
601,00:41:37.12,00:41:37.12,Fight to find it. Aras holding steady.
602,00:41:44.54,00:41:44.54,"Terry still struggling. You've got 30 seconds, Terry."
603,00:41:56.62,00:41:56.62,20 second left to get those hands up.
604,00:41:59.79,00:41:59.79,Danielle is up. Aras is up.
605,00:42:02.33,00:42:02.33,"Terry, you need to get up in 15 seconds."
606,00:42:05.29,00:42:05.29,"14, 13.,, This is it, Terry."
607,00:42:11.33,00:42:11.33,Ten seconds. Aras and Danielle are up.
608,00:42:15.17,00:42:15.17,Terry's having trouble getting up.
609,00:42:22.08,00:42:22.08,"Four, three, put your hands up, Terry."
610,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,You've got to do it. Terry is up.
611,00:42:28.25,00:42:28.25,"At the last second, he found balance."
612,00:42:30.17,00:42:30.17,Everybody is up. The challenge is back on.
613,00:42:44.00,00:42:44.00,Terry cannot hang on. The first person out of this
614,00:42:47.92,00:42:47.92,challenge. It's down to Aras and Danielle
615,00:42:58.92,00:42:58.92,"for final immunity. Aras is out of the challenge,"
616,00:43:12.62,00:43:12.62,Danielle wins immunity. Danielle going to the final two.
617,00:43:19.25,00:43:19.25,"Danielle, come on over. The first one, but it couldn't"
618,00:43:24.38,00:43:24.38,"come at a better time, huh? You are safe at tonight's vote."
619,00:43:28.67,00:43:28.67,You're guaranteed a spot in the final two.
620,00:43:30.71,00:43:30.71,"And at Tribal Council tonight, you will decide whether it is"
621,00:43:33.25,00:43:33.25,Terry or Aras that sits next to you at that final Tribal
622,00:43:37.00,00:43:37.00,Council. Big decision.
623,00:43:38.71,00:43:38.71,You have the opportunity to figure it out.
624,00:43:40.25,00:43:40.25,Get your stuff. Bring the boat in.
625,00:44:31.25,00:44:31.25,>> God never makes it easy for me.
626,00:44:34.25,00:44:34.25,"The one immunity challenge I win is a last one, and it's a"
627,00:44:36.92,00:44:36.92,huge decision that I have to make tonight-- who do I want to
628,00:44:41.08,00:44:41.08,"take with me to the final two, either Aras or Terry?"
629,00:44:44.50,00:44:44.50,"So, I mean, it was so gratifying to win the last"
630,00:44:47.12,00:44:47.12,"immunity challenge, but at the same time, my brain started"
631,00:44:50.17,00:44:50.17,thinking right away. I knew I had a decision to make
632,00:44:53.75,00:44:53.75,tonight that could cost me or earn me a million dollars.
633,00:45:05.71,00:45:05.71,It's difficult because I told Terry when I was on Exile
634,00:45:08.75,00:45:08.75,"Island with him that if either of us won, we would take each"
635,00:45:11.92,00:45:11.92,"other, but then it's like, during the challenge, Aras,"
636,00:45:16.25,00:45:16.25,"you know, I gave him, like, a head nod, and so he jumped off,"
637,00:45:20.17,00:45:20.17,thinking that I would take him to the finals.
638,00:45:23.33,00:45:23.33,"And that doesn't mean anything right now, because, at this"
639,00:45:26.58,00:45:26.58,"point, there's a million dollars at stake, and I'm not"
640,00:45:29.12,00:45:29.12,going to take somebody because I made a promise to them.
641,00:45:32.83,00:45:32.83,I'm going to take someone who I think I have a better chance of
642,00:45:35.21,00:45:35.21,beating. >> The big question.
643,00:45:54.29,00:45:54.29,>> Do you feel that it's fair for me to take someone
644,00:46:00.12,00:46:00.12,"that I think can beat me? >> Um, I-I..."
645,00:46:05.08,00:46:05.08,">> As someone in my position right now, because I didn't"
646,00:46:07.54,00:46:07.54,"expect to be in this position, to be honest with you."
647,00:46:10.25,00:46:10.25,">> Right, right. Um, had I won today, I would"
648,00:46:14.58,00:46:14.58,have already told you that you were going to the finals with
649,00:46:19.75,00:46:19.75,me. You want to put this down?
650,00:46:21.25,00:46:21.25,">> Yeah. I know, I'm just trying to... I"
651,00:46:24.21,00:46:24.21,"did not expect to be in this position, and if you had given"
652,00:46:27.04,00:46:27.04,"me the hidden immunity idol, I would have 100% took you."
653,00:46:30.04,00:46:30.04,">> Right, right. >> Without any question, it"
654,00:46:31.62,00:46:31.62,wouldn't be an issue right now. I'm not saying I'm not taking
655,00:46:34.38,00:46:34.38,"you, 'cause I haven't... >> Right."
656,00:46:36.71,00:46:36.71,>> I'm just trying to go over everything in my head and go
657,00:46:40.25,00:46:40.25,"over... you know, and if you were in my shoes, you would do"
658,00:46:43.12,00:46:43.12,the same thing. You want to...
659,00:46:44.21,00:46:44.21,">> Right, right. >> You would want to bring"
660,00:46:45.83,00:46:45.83,someone... and it's a toss-up. >> You haven't...
661,00:46:48.04,00:46:48.04,>> It's not like one of you is better to bring than the other.
662,00:46:51.50,00:46:51.50,"So I'm just, like, freaking out because I won't... I don't..."
663,00:46:55.92,00:46:55.92,I don't know. >> Danielle is finding herself
664,00:46:58.04,00:46:58.04,"very confused right now, and, oh, God, I hope she's not"
665,00:47:04.17,00:47:04.17,confused when it comes to the point of choos... taking me to
666,00:47:06.62,00:47:06.62,"the finals. If I were a betting man, I would"
667,00:47:12.21,00:47:12.21,"choose me only because of the Casaya loyalty, and it would be"
668,00:47:17.58,00:47:17.58,"an easy decision. >> But by me taking you, they're"
669,00:47:19.62,00:47:19.62,gonna look at it as I'm already being disloyal to them 'cause
670,00:47:23.04,00:47:23.04,"I... >> No, no, because then it just"
671,00:47:25.46,00:47:25.46,makes the picture more black and white.
672,00:47:27.58,00:47:27.58,"""Oh, guys, yeah, I'm here. Thanks, you know?"
673,00:47:29.50,00:47:29.50,I kinda won a bunch of challenges and then was the
674,00:47:32.92,00:47:32.92,"nail in your side, you know? Can I please have your vote?"""
675,00:47:36.17,00:47:36.17,"Uh-uh, I don't think that's happening."
676,00:47:38.17,00:47:38.17,And I know it's gonna be hard. >> I just hope you will respect
677,00:47:41.29,00:47:41.29,whatever decision I make. I honestly haven't made a
678,00:47:43.71,00:47:43.71,decision and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
679,00:47:45.58,00:47:45.58,>> I have to. I have to. I'm not gonna sit there and
680,00:47:48.17,00:47:48.17,"throw daggers at you with my eyes from the jury, okay?"
681,00:47:51.58,00:47:51.58,>> Please. >> And it's been fun.
682,00:47:56.08,00:47:56.08,>> It has been fun. And this sucks.
683,00:47:59.08,00:47:59.08,I can't deal with this decision. I hate... I'm so indecisive as
684,00:48:03.04,00:48:03.04,"it is because I'm a Gemini. >> Okay, I think I'm gonna jump"
685,00:48:16.54,00:48:16.54,in the water. I think the tide was still going
686,00:48:18.67,00:48:18.67,"out. >> Yeah, I think so, too."
687,00:48:20.17,00:48:20.17,No doubt about it. When Terry and Danielle went to
688,00:48:23.58,00:48:23.58,"get water, I had my first bit of paranoia in this game, more"
689,00:48:26.17,00:48:26.17,"than just a bit. I was, like, ""Man, what's going"
690,00:48:28.25,00:48:28.25,on? Are they talking about me?
691,00:48:29.62,00:48:29.62,"I mean, I know they're talking about me, but is she gonna get"
692,00:48:32.21,00:48:32.21,swayed? Is Terry gonna be able to sway
693,00:48:34.25,00:48:34.25,"her, bla-bla, bla? My mind starts racing."
694,00:48:35.58,00:48:35.58,"Like, I would just feel so burned if, like, you voted for"
695,00:48:38.17,00:48:38.17,"Terry instead of me, and my dumbass jumped off the lily pad"
696,00:48:40.58,00:48:40.58,"because you said ""Yeah,"" you know?"
697,00:48:43.67,00:48:43.67,>> I haven't... I'm just going over stuff in my head.
698,00:48:45.88,00:48:45.88,This is a huge decision. >> I know.
699,00:48:47.17,00:48:47.17,>> I wasn't expecting to win this today.
700,00:48:49.25,00:48:49.25,"Like, I wasn't expecting it to go my way."
701,00:48:51.92,00:48:51.92,">> I think, honestly, I think you have ten times better chance"
702,00:48:54.96,00:48:54.96,"against me than Terry, and that's not trying to be"
703,00:48:57.12,00:48:57.12,"manipulative, but if you do vote Terry, then you lose me and"
704,00:48:59.83,00:48:59.83,Cirie anyways. >> All right.
705,00:49:12.25,00:49:12.25,>> I thought we were golden once you said we are.
706,00:49:15.04,00:49:15.04,">> We, we really, we pretty much are."
707,00:49:17.08,00:49:17.08,">> Pretty much are? You can't, D, you can't do this"
708,00:49:20.12,00:49:20.12,to me. >> I need to go off by myself
709,00:49:22.04,00:49:22.04,"and just think about this. >> Either way, would you tell me"
710,00:49:24.46,00:49:24.46,either way so I don't go in like an idiot?
711,00:49:26.67,00:49:26.67,">> Yes, yes, yes. >> And remember that you did"
712,00:49:29.08,00:49:29.08,give me your word when I was on the lily pad.
713,00:49:31.17,00:49:31.17,">> I know, I know, I know. All right, I'll be back."
714,00:49:33.71,00:49:33.71,>> All right. >> Listening to Aras' sales
715,00:49:37.38,00:49:37.38,pitch was just mind-boggling. Aras is all about honesty and
716,00:49:41.83,00:49:41.83,"integrity, but, in the same sense, he's contradicting"
717,00:49:45.79,00:49:45.79,himself because he's basically threatening me.
718,00:49:48.46,00:49:48.46,">> You better bring me, I swear to God."
719,00:49:50.50,00:49:50.50,"I will be shocked if you don't, let's just say that."
720,00:49:53.92,00:49:53.92,>> All right. (groans) Part of Aras' sales pitch to me
721,00:49:58.92,00:49:58.92,"was that he would not vote for me if I took Terry, so I would"
722,00:50:02.33,00:50:02.33,"lose his vote and Cirie's vote, which I think is completely"
723,00:50:06.25,00:50:06.25,"messed up. Aras is very manipulative, so"
724,00:50:08.75,00:50:08.75,that's why I'm kinda hesitant to take him or even listen to what
725,00:50:14.21,00:50:14.21,he says because I want the million dollars.
726,00:50:16.50,00:50:16.50,"I'm not gonna base my losing a million dollars to, ""Oh,  told "
727,00:50:20.75,00:50:20.75,"Aras I would take him."" I'm gonna go with what I think."
728,00:50:24.04,00:50:24.04,This is how I've played this game so far and I believe that's
729,00:50:27.29,00:50:27.29,why I'm where I am right now. >> You know what?
730,00:50:46.33,00:50:46.33,"It's your decision to make. You won the thing today, so if"
731,00:50:49.62,00:50:49.62,"you think I'll be better to take, do that."
732,00:50:52.50,00:50:52.50,"If you think Aras would be better to take, do that."
733,00:50:54.88,00:50:54.88,">> Okay. >> Terry, regardless, man."
734,00:51:04.25,00:51:04.25,"It's been a pleasure. It's been a journey with you,"
735,00:51:07.75,00:51:07.75,man. Battle on.
736,00:51:37.33,00:51:37.33,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of the jury:
737,00:51:40.79,00:51:40.79,"Austin, Sally... Bruce, Courtney..."
738,00:51:47.12,00:51:47.12,Shane and Cirie. Let's talk about the final
739,00:51:57.17,00:51:57.17,"immunity challenge. The two big dogs, Terry and"
740,00:52:00.96,00:52:00.96,"Aras, don't come through, and Danielle, suddenly, you're"
741,00:52:05.12,00:52:05.12,sitting in the most enviable position in this game.
742,00:52:07.62,00:52:07.62,How does it feel having that immunity necklace around you?
743,00:52:10.33,00:52:10.33,>> It feels great and it was an honor to be able to win the most
744,00:52:15.04,00:52:15.04,"important challenge of the entire game, but the decision "
745,00:52:19.04,00:52:19.04,that I have to make tonight is one of the most difficult
746,00:52:22.29,00:52:22.29,"decisions I've probably, I will have to make ever in my life."
747,00:52:26.46,00:52:26.46,It's like a scary feeling 'cause I'm not sure which way I want to
748,00:52:30.17,00:52:30.17,"go, and my brain is about to explode out of my head."
749,00:52:33.08,00:52:33.08,So I just wanted them both to understand and respect where I'm
750,00:52:36.54,00:52:36.54,coming from and just don't hate me after this.
751,00:52:40.00,00:52:40.00,">> PROBST: Terry, you played this game as competitively as it"
752,00:52:44.67,00:52:44.67,can be played for 38 days. Are you able to respect the
753,00:52:48.25,00:52:48.25,position that Danielle's in? >> That part of not winning the
754,00:52:52.17,00:52:52.17,"last immunity challenge, it's frustrating to have come through"
755,00:52:55.08,00:52:55.08,this with both the hidden immunity idol and the necklace
756,00:52:57.92,00:52:57.92,most of the time. >> PROBST: So you did have the
757,00:53:00.25,00:53:00.25,"hidden immunity idol? >> Oh yeah, oh, yeah."
758,00:53:03.12,00:53:03.12,"Had that the whole time. Uh, I can separate myself"
759,00:53:07.29,00:53:07.29,because I have to. It's a different part of the
760,00:53:09.79,00:53:09.79,game than the competition side. It's a number-crunching thing.
761,00:53:13.08,00:53:13.08,"You know, I think it's in my better interest and her better"
762,00:53:15.67,00:53:15.67,interest to go with my side. But it's now a mental thing for
763,00:53:20.17,00:53:20.17,"her to go through, but you know, do I want to go home tonight?"
764,00:53:23.75,00:53:23.75,"No stinking way. >> PROBST: Aras, you come up to"
765,00:53:28.04,00:53:28.04,Danielle who you've been with in the same tribe and the same
766,00:53:31.58,00:53:31.58,alliance for a long time. What do you say at this point?
767,00:53:35.50,00:53:35.50,">> To be honest with you, I thought I was golden."
768,00:53:38.25,00:53:38.25,"And obviously, it's a big decision for D, I understand"
769,00:53:40.46,00:53:40.46,"that, and she's starting to worry, and then I begin to get a"
770,00:53:43.29,00:53:43.29,"little paranoid, so I just told her, this is, like, basically"
771,00:53:45.96,00:53:45.96,"the situation, it's in both of our best interests to be in the"
772,00:53:48.79,00:53:48.79,"final two together. We have the best shot, and"
773,00:53:51.00,00:53:51.00,that's kinda how I threw it out there.
774,00:53:52.71,00:53:52.71,">> PROBST: Danielle, as you think about this more and more,"
775,00:53:56.00,00:53:56.00,does it get more and more complicated?
776,00:53:58.12,00:53:58.12,">> Yeah, it is. I just feel like crying."
777,00:54:01.29,00:54:01.29,"Like, right after you put the necklace around my neck, I just"
778,00:54:05.21,00:54:05.21,started thinking about it and I haven't stopped since...
779,00:54:07.54,00:54:07.54,"I'm still thinking about it. I mean, I'm just... Ah!"
780,00:54:12.58,00:54:12.58,"I don't know. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"
781,00:54:20.00,00:54:20.00,the vote. Danielle has immunity.
782,00:54:22.21,00:54:22.21,"You cannot vote for her, so Aras, you can only vote for"
783,00:54:24.96,00:54:24.96,"Terry, Terry can only vote for Aras."
784,00:54:27.08,00:54:27.08,Your votes cancel each other out.
785,00:54:29.04,00:54:29.04,Danielle will be the only person to vote.
786,00:54:31.04,00:54:31.04,"In doing so, you will vote the 14th person out of this game and"
787,00:54:35.46,00:54:35.46,you will also decide who's gonna sit next to you at the final
788,00:54:38.42,00:54:38.42,Tribal Council. It is time to vote.
789,00:54:41.92,00:54:41.92,"Danielle, you're up. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
790,00:55:24.50,00:55:24.50,"I'll go get the vote. Once the votes are read, the"
791,00:55:47.67,00:55:47.67,decision is final. The person voted out will be
792,00:55:50.17,00:55:50.17,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
793,00:55:51.88,00:55:51.88,I'll read the vote. The 14th person voted out of
794,00:55:59.67,00:55:59.67,Survivor: Exile Island... Terry. You need to bring me your
795,00:56:12.08,00:56:12.08,torch. >> Thank you.
796,00:56:15.21,00:56:15.21,">> Wow. >> PROBST: Terry, the tribe has"
797,00:56:28.71,00:56:28.71,"spoken. >> Thanks for the journey, you"
798,00:56:36.92,00:56:36.92,"guys. >> PROBST: Danielle, Aras,"
799,00:56:45.42,00:56:45.42,congratulations. You've made it as far as you can
800,00:56:47.88,00:56:47.88,go in this game. The power now shifts to the
801,00:56:50.42,00:56:50.42,jury and the decision they will ultimately make.
802,00:56:54.17,00:56:54.17,You two have one more night in Panama.
803,00:56:56.92,00:56:56.92,Enjoy it. See you tomorrow for final
804,00:56:58.54,00:56:58.54,Tribal Council. Grab your torches.
805,00:57:00.25,00:57:00.25,Back to camp. Good night. >> The biggest mistake I made
806,00:57:08.04,00:57:08.04,was not keeping the game in my own hands and then relying on
807,00:57:12.42,00:57:12.42,somebody else to take care of it for me.
808,00:57:15.42,00:57:15.42,"That's what got me. But, uh, it was not bad for a"
809,00:57:18.79,00:57:18.79,46-year-old guy. And I hope I made my friends and
810,00:57:21.21,00:57:21.21,"family proud, and Terry Dietz is not a perfect guy, and there's"
811,00:57:25.21,00:57:25.21,"always room for better change. >> Oh, my God. Final two."
812,00:57:44.71,00:57:44.71,"D, I'm so happy! We're the two youngest people in"
813,00:57:48.62,00:57:48.62,"the game, I think. >> I know."
814,00:57:52.50,00:57:52.50,">> It was a tense, tense Tribal Council for me, and it made"
815,00:57:55.42,00:57:55.42,getting into the final two that much sweeter for me.
816,00:58:00.25,00:58:00.25,"I mean, I am ecstatic right now. I'm so happy."
817,00:58:03.21,00:58:03.21,"Oh, my God, we did it, girl. >> We did it."
818,00:58:06.04,00:58:06.04,"Do you think they were shocked that I picked Terry, or do you"
819,00:58:08.12,00:58:08.12,think they knew that? >> I think they knew that.
820,00:58:10.12,00:58:10.12,">> Yeah. >> Oh, come here."
821,00:58:13.46,00:58:13.46,"Regardless of the results, I played this game the full 39"
822,00:58:17.17,00:58:17.17,"days, I played it with integrity and I played it with a lot of"
823,00:58:20.33,00:58:20.33,"intensity, and more importantly than anything else, I really"
824,00:58:25.42,00:58:25.42,"enjoyed myself out here. Oh, my gosh."
825,00:58:29.25,00:58:29.25,">> I can't believe it. >> I'm so glad it's me and you,"
826,00:58:31.92,00:58:31.92,too. >> I know.
827,00:58:34.33,00:58:34.33,It's great. >> Just chilling tonight.
828,00:58:37.21,00:58:37.21,">> Who would've thought, huh? >> The reason why I decided to"
829,00:58:39.58,00:58:39.58,take Aras is because Aras is a part of the former Casaya Tribe.
830,00:58:45.71,00:58:45.71,">> Whoa, everything must burn. For me at the end, to go ahead"
831,00:58:51.62,00:58:51.62,"and pick Terry over Aras, I think would've been a slap in"
832,00:58:55.62,00:58:55.62,"everybody's face. So, my gut choice was Aras."
833,00:58:59.75,00:58:59.75,That's just what it was and I went with it.
834,00:59:02.88,00:59:02.88,"That's what I've been doing this entire game, and I think that's"
835,00:59:05.04,00:59:05.04,why I've gotten this far. I can't believe this is the last
836,00:59:08.21,00:59:08.21,night. >> The last night.
837,00:59:10.17,00:59:10.17,"Today would've been the hardest day to go home, I think,"
838,00:59:13.25,00:59:13.25,"'cause you're so close. >> Yeah, yeah."
839,00:59:15.38,00:59:15.38,My job isn't done yet. I'm still not satisfied.
840,00:59:18.33,00:59:18.33,"I'm in sales, so hopefully, I can, uh, do some persuading to"
841,00:59:21.42,00:59:21.42,the jury and hope for the best. Because I want that million
842,00:59:26.12,00:59:26.12,"dollars, I don't want to settle for anything less than first"
843,00:59:28.71,00:59:28.71,place. >> Ah...
844,00:59:44.71,00:59:44.71,">> Look at that. >> Oh, my God."
845,00:59:47.38,00:59:47.38,">> Get out of Dodge. >> Yay! Thank you, Lord!"
846,00:59:51.83,00:59:51.83,">> ""Congratulations. You've outwitted, outlasted and"
847,00:59:54.17,00:59:54.17,outplayed 14 others. Now there are seven who hold
848,00:59:56.88,00:59:56.88,your fate in their hands. So relax and enjoy your final
849,00:59:59.75,00:59:59.75,"day on the island, because tonight you will be held"
850,01:00:02.12,01:00:02.12,"accountable and one of you will be named the sole survivor."""
851,01:00:07.04,01:00:07.04,>> Oh! I'm so happy. >> We need to cook the eggs.
852,01:00:10.88,01:00:10.88,">> Yeah, we do. >> To our surprise, there was"
853,01:00:13.17,01:00:13.17,"milk, orange juice, champagne, pancake mix, eggs."
854,01:00:18.08,01:00:18.08,>> You want to have a glass of orange juice right now or do you
855,01:00:21.04,01:00:21.04,want to have a mimosa? >> Let's have a mimosa right
856,01:00:22.62,01:00:22.62,now. >> All right.
857,01:00:24.17,01:00:24.17,">> Everything that we were craving was just right there, at"
858,01:00:27.08,01:00:27.08,tree mail. >> Thank you for this wonderful
859,01:00:29.54,01:00:29.54,food! >> Feels great.
860,01:00:32.67,01:00:32.67,I need some fat in my body right now.
861,01:00:35.71,01:00:35.71,">> Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm. >> Mmm!"
862,01:00:38.21,01:00:38.21,>> This is so bomb. >> We're going to go for a walk
863,01:00:42.25,01:00:42.25,now and enjoy some champagne and put everything into perspective
864,01:00:46.17,01:00:46.17,"our last day here. You know, leave a game that"
865,01:00:49.21,01:00:49.21,sometimes didn't feel so civil in a very civil manner.
866,01:01:05.58,01:01:05.58,>> Oh! (glass shatters)
867,01:01:15.75,01:01:15.75,"(groans) >> Oh, that's nasty."
868,01:01:36.00,01:01:36.00,I've been out on those rocks maybe a hundred times.
869,01:01:38.12,01:01:38.12,"I'm not really sure exactly how I went down, but I knew right"
870,01:01:40.71,01:01:40.71,"away something was wrong. I tried to get up, I was kind of"
871,01:01:43.42,01:01:43.42,lightheaded. I thought I was going to faint.
872,01:01:56.12,01:01:56.12,>> 39 days and Aras does this on the last day.
873,01:02:08.04,01:02:08.04,>> I was a little nervous when Aras was saying he felt
874,01:02:10.04,01:02:10.04,"faint, you know, I was getting  a little nervous, 'cause I saw"
875,01:02:12.92,01:02:12.92,all the blood. >> The thought of seeing blood
876,01:02:20.21,01:02:20.21,"scares me and to actually see it gushing out like it did, freaked"
877,01:02:23.50,01:02:23.50,"me out, absolutely. So it looks like he's going to"
878,01:02:27.62,01:02:27.62,have to get some stitches. It's pretty bad.
879,01:02:38.12,01:02:38.12,>> ...I've seen better days. >> I got a cut in my back.
880,01:02:42.54,01:02:42.54,"There was a shard, I had to pull it out."
881,01:02:45.25,01:02:45.25,It was pretty deep in there. >> Drug him up.
882,01:03:07.62,01:03:07.62,>> Are you just going to numb the whole hand?
883,01:03:10.08,01:03:10.08,">> No, just around where the lacerations are, mate."
884,01:03:12.46,01:03:12.46,Get a 23-gauge. This is going to be a bit of a
885,01:03:15.54,01:03:15.54,"sting, as you know. >> Burning."
886,01:03:22.71,01:03:22.71,>> Uh! I was trying to watch them stick
887,01:03:25.25,01:03:25.25,the needle in. I was just imagining it being
888,01:03:27.08,01:03:27.08,"myself, and it just looked so painful."
889,01:03:30.21,01:03:30.21,">> Had to keep it interesting on day 39, you know."
890,01:03:33.04,01:03:33.04,>> Last day. >> He ended up getting three
891,01:03:37.25,01:03:37.25,"stitches on one side of his finger, four stitches on the"
892,01:03:39.79,01:03:39.79,"palm of his hand, and then another stitch on his back."
893,01:03:43.08,01:03:43.08,>> You don't think I'll feel anything tonight?
894,01:03:45.21,01:03:45.21,">> So, I mean, he got stitched up pretty nice."
895,01:03:48.00,01:03:48.00,>> I got my butt kicked out here by the elements.
896,01:03:51.04,01:03:51.04,I got my butt kicked by Terry Deitz a lot of the time.
897,01:03:54.04,01:03:54.04,I got my butt kicked by my own shortsightedness-- falling down
898,01:03:57.29,01:03:57.29,on the rocks. Despite the fact that I made it
899,01:04:00.12,01:04:00.12,"39 days, I feel like my ego has been crushed."
900,01:04:05.42,01:04:05.42,"I feel so stupid for falling. >> It's so funny, day 39 this"
901,01:04:25.83,01:04:25.83,happens. I just feel terrible.
902,01:04:29.92,01:04:29.92,>> Don't feel like that. It was an accident.
903,01:04:33.04,01:04:33.04,">> I wanted to, like, go out... cool thing and then I go out."
904,01:04:37.58,01:04:37.58,>> This day was definitely your day.
905,01:04:41.17,01:04:41.17,>> My day to be a... I kind of came in as a buffoon
906,01:04:45.71,01:04:45.71,"and I kind of went out as a buffoon, and in between I did"
907,01:04:49.12,01:04:49.12,some pretty cool things. That's life.
908,01:04:52.71,01:04:52.71,"I mean, you fall, you get back up and you try again."
909,01:04:57.58,01:04:57.58,Sometimes you need to get stitched up before you can try
910,01:05:00.25,01:05:00.25,again. Falling down and hurting myself
911,01:05:05.12,01:05:05.12,"today reminded me just how human I am, and reminded me just how"
912,01:05:08.88,01:05:08.88,"much of a game this is. What that is is saying, ""Look,"
913,01:05:12.96,01:05:12.96,"Aras, you don't have to be a superman, you don't have to be a"
914,01:05:15.96,01:05:15.96,"superhero and you'll be okay."" And so, with that perspective,"
915,01:05:20.38,01:05:20.38,"coming into Tribal Council, maybe I'll be able to connect"
916,01:05:23.12,01:05:23.12,with people at a deeper level. That's the hope.
917,01:05:42.96,01:05:42.96,>> I can't really say there's one thing that I've learned
918,01:05:46.17,01:05:46.17,about myself that I didn't know coming into this.
919,01:05:50.50,01:05:50.50,It just drew a clearer picture for me.
920,01:05:54.04,01:05:54.04,"It let me know I'm strong, you know, I'm a strong,"
921,01:05:56.62,01:05:56.62,"independent woman, and I knew I could get through it, and I did"
922,01:05:59.21,01:05:59.21,"it. I'm so proud of myself, I"
923,01:06:02.21,01:06:02.21,really am. I just hope people dig deep
924,01:06:06.08,01:06:06.08,tonight in the jury. I hope they pick the right
925,01:06:10.00,01:06:10.00,"person, being me. >> You all packed up?"
926,01:06:22.12,01:06:22.12,>> Yeah. It's like weird.
927,01:06:25.00,01:06:25.00,">> It is weird, isn't it? This is the last day."
928,01:06:29.62,01:06:29.62,"Come here, stand up, give me a hug."
929,01:06:33.46,01:06:33.46,"Oh, whatever happens tonight, D, I'm so happy I got to share this"
930,01:06:36.17,01:06:36.17,with you. This has been an amazing ride.
931,01:06:40.17,01:06:40.17,"And hopefully, there will be an amazing reward at the end of it."
932,01:06:44.38,01:06:44.38,But I'm just so grateful that I got the time out here that I
933,01:06:47.42,01:06:47.42,got. I'll never forget the moments
934,01:06:50.71,01:06:50.71,"that I spent out here, and the people that I spent the moments"
935,01:06:53.58,01:06:53.58,with. >> PROBST: I'll now bring in the
936,01:07:21.79,01:07:21.79,"members of the jury. Austin, Sally..."
937,01:07:28.46,01:07:28.46,"Bruce, Courtney, Shane,  Cirie, and Terry, voted out at"
938,01:07:36.17,01:07:36.17,the last Tribal Council. Welcome to your final Tribal
939,01:07:42.67,01:07:42.67,Council. Before we get to the proceedings
940,01:07:45.58,01:07:45.58,"tonight, Aras, you're bandaged up, what happened?"
941,01:07:49.12,01:07:49.12,>> Danielle and I were walking out to the rocks to like spend
942,01:07:52.79,01:07:52.79,one last moment together. And these rocks I must've been
943,01:07:57.00,01:07:57.00,"on 50 times, you know, throughout this game, and I just"
944,01:08:00.17,01:08:00.17,"slipped, and I split my palm and my pinky, and the medical team"
945,01:08:04.50,01:08:04.50,came in and stitched me up all over the place.
946,01:08:08.83,01:08:08.83,"But I'm all right now. >> PROBST: Well, the good news"
947,01:08:11.42,01:08:11.42,is you won't be going back to that beach anymore.
948,01:08:14.50,01:08:14.50,Congratulations to you both because you have done what 14
949,01:08:17.29,01:08:17.29,other people weren't able to do in this game-- make it to the
950,01:08:20.58,01:08:20.58,final two. But the power tonight shifts
951,01:08:23.92,01:08:23.92,"away from you two, over to the jury."
952,01:08:27.12,01:08:27.12,Seven people that you two either directly or indirectly had a
953,01:08:30.58,01:08:30.58,hand in voting out of this game now hold your fate in their
954,01:08:33.83,01:08:33.83,"hands. Tonight, they will decide who"
955,01:08:36.79,01:08:36.79,they think is most deserving of the title of sole survivor and
956,01:08:40.08,01:08:40.08,the million-dollar check that goes along with it.
957,01:08:44.25,01:08:44.25,Here's how it's going to work. You'll each get a chance to make
958,01:08:47.58,01:08:47.58,"an opening statement, this is an opportunity to make your case"
959,01:08:50.88,01:08:50.88,about why you deserve to win this game.
960,01:08:54.67,01:08:54.67,Then the jury will get the first chance to address you with a
961,01:08:57.67,01:08:57.67,comment or a question. Then you'll get a chance for a
962,01:09:01.88,01:09:01.88,"final, closing comment. Make sense?"
963,01:09:05.08,01:09:05.08,>> Yeah. Opening statements-- Aras.
964,01:09:09.58,01:09:09.58,">> Wow, guys. Um, first, I just want to say"
965,01:09:13.71,01:09:13.71,thank you. This has been an amazing
966,01:09:15.79,01:09:15.79,experience for me. And I hope when you guys vote
967,01:09:18.67,01:09:18.67,"tonight, that you guys will look at the way that I played"
968,01:09:21.04,01:09:21.04,"the game. You know, I worked my butt off"
969,01:09:23.21,01:09:23.21,"at camp, I think. I worked hard in the challenges."
970,01:09:26.25,01:09:26.25,"And I really made an effort to get to know each one of you,"
971,01:09:29.25,01:09:29.25,"not because I wanted your vote, but I really feel like I made"
972,01:09:31.92,01:09:31.92,an effort to get to know you guys and connect.
973,01:09:34.42,01:09:34.42,"I set out to play this game with honesty and integrity, and"
974,01:09:36.96,01:09:36.96,I feel like for the most part I did that.
975,01:09:39.21,01:09:39.21,And I hope that you guys will see that.
976,01:09:41.17,01:09:41.17,"And honestly, whichever way you guys decide to vote, it's been"
977,01:09:43.67,01:09:43.67,an amazing experience. >> PROBST: Danielle.
978,01:09:50.33,01:09:50.33,">> Guys, just want to thank you for making this an unbelievable"
979,01:09:55.04,01:09:55.04,journey for me. I just came into this thinking
980,01:09:58.79,01:09:58.79,that I just wanted to be myself. I wanted to do the best that I
981,01:10:03.00,01:10:03.00,could do out here. I wanted to build relationships.
982,01:10:07.04,01:10:07.04,I wanted to seek out who I could trust and who I could
983,01:10:09.29,01:10:09.29,"relate to. I mean, in a perfect world,"
984,01:10:12.04,01:10:12.04,everybody wants to play this game with integrity and
985,01:10:14.25,01:10:14.25,"honesty, but let's be realistic here."
986,01:10:16.67,01:10:16.67,"I mean, at some point in the game, you're going to have to"
987,01:10:19.25,01:10:19.25,"deceive somebody, and you just have to make that decision"
988,01:10:22.04,01:10:22.04,whether it's the right time to do that.
989,01:10:25.12,01:10:25.12,"Anyways, to get down to the point-- this is going to be a"
990,01:10:28.08,01:10:28.08,difficult decision for you guys. I just hope you make the right
991,01:10:31.08,01:10:31.08,"decision. >> PROBST: All right, jury, in"
992,01:10:35.46,01:10:35.46,"a moment, you're going to get your first chance to address"
993,01:10:38.29,01:10:38.29,Danielle and Aras. I'll give you a minute to think
994,01:10:40.96,01:10:40.96,"about what you want to say. >> PROBST: All right, jury, some"
995,01:10:55.04,01:10:55.04,of you have been waiting a long time for this: your first
996,01:10:58.58,01:10:58.58,opportunity to address Danielle and Aras to get the information
997,01:11:02.75,01:11:02.75,you need to make a million dollar vote.
998,01:11:06.58,01:11:06.58,"Let's get started. Sally, you're up first."
999,01:11:14.17,01:11:14.17,">> Hey, guys. Congratulations to you both."
1000,01:11:17.79,01:11:17.79,You should feel very proud of where you're sitting.
1001,01:11:20.04,01:11:20.04,"You guys worked hard, and I really haven't made my decision"
1002,01:11:22.00,01:11:22.00,"yet, so I do have a question that I'm going to ask."
1003,01:11:25.08,01:11:25.08,Of the six original Casaya members that you had such a
1004,01:11:28.12,01:11:28.12,strong connection with that I could not for the life of me
1005,01:11:30.58,01:11:30.58,"figure out how to get into, of those six, who contributed the"
1006,01:11:34.46,01:11:34.46,most to why you're sitting there?
1007,01:11:36.46,01:11:36.46,"Danielle, you can go first. >> Cirie would be the one"
1008,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,person that I would say is the reason why I'm sitting here.
1009,01:11:43.79,01:11:43.79,I just had a connection with her.
1010,01:11:45.62,01:11:45.62,I was at Exile six days out of the 39 days.
1011,01:11:49.12,01:11:49.12,"And when you come back from Exile Island, you don't know"
1012,01:11:51.17,01:11:51.17,"what's been going on, so I always had Cirie to fill me in,"
1013,01:11:55.46,01:11:55.46,and she did. And I always trusted her.
1014,01:11:59.79,01:11:59.79,>> Thank you. Aras.
1015,01:12:02.83,01:12:02.83,">> Ironically, I also would say Cirie."
1016,01:12:06.33,01:12:06.33,"One, just as a friend. You need to have somebody you"
1017,01:12:08.88,01:12:08.88,"can just relate to, and then at other times it's strategic."
1018,01:12:11.92,01:12:11.92,And we helped each other. We took each other on a reward.
1019,01:12:14.00,01:12:14.00,It was a mutually beneficial relationship.
1020,01:12:17.04,01:12:17.04,"But I think if I had to single out one person, Cirie would be"
1021,01:12:20.00,01:12:20.00,the person. >> Congratulations again.
1022,01:12:23.08,01:12:23.08,Thank you so much. >> PROBST: Bruce.
1023,01:12:30.25,01:12:30.25,">> Wow, I get to address you guys and congratulations."
1024,01:12:33.25,01:12:33.25,"You guys battled like real samurai warriors to me, both"
1025,01:12:35.79,01:12:35.79,of you. Now we have the responsibility
1026,01:12:38.08,01:12:38.08,of deciding who's going to get that million dollars.
1027,01:12:41.79,01:12:41.79,"And what I want to know is, beyond the million dollars, if"
1028,01:12:44.88,01:12:44.88,"you were given that, what are you going to be doing with that"
1029,01:12:48.54,01:12:48.54,responsibility? That's what I'd like to know.
1030,01:12:51.83,01:12:51.83,">> PROBST: Aras. >> To be honest, Bruce, I don't"
1031,01:12:54.50,01:12:54.50,know if I can inspire anybody else unless I change myself.
1032,01:12:58.38,01:12:58.38,"And so for me, my focus at the age that I am is really, like,"
1033,01:13:01.54,01:13:01.54,"can I make myself a better person, and hopefully, through"
1034,01:13:04.17,01:13:04.17,"that, that will inspire other people."
1035,01:13:08.17,01:13:08.17,I don't know if that worked. >> PROBST: Danielle.
1036,01:13:10.88,01:13:10.88,">> I would love to just share my experiences, maybe just give"
1037,01:13:14.08,01:13:14.08,speeches to younger children and let them know you can
1038,01:13:17.25,01:13:17.25,really do anything you put your mind to.
1039,01:13:18.88,01:13:18.88,"I mean, I never in a million years thought I'd be sitting in"
1040,01:13:21.25,01:13:21.25,"this seat right now, and I would just love to share my"
1041,01:13:24.29,01:13:24.29,experiences with other people and encourage them to do
1042,01:13:26.88,01:13:26.88,whatever they want. >> Okay.
1043,01:13:33.96,01:13:33.96,">> PROBST: Terry. >> Danielle, I'd first like"
1044,01:13:42.38,01:13:42.38,"to make a comment, that your part about deceiving somebody"
1045,01:13:44.42,01:13:44.42,and having to do it sometime during the game is totally
1046,01:13:46.50,01:13:46.50,"off-base. After 38 days, I never came"
1047,01:13:49.42,01:13:49.42,"close to deceiving anyone. Somewhere down the line,"
1048,01:13:52.96,01:13:52.96,"Danielle, I hope that your family and friends and the"
1049,01:13:57.12,01:13:57.12,"ringing in your ears doesn't say ""should have taken the navy"
1050,01:14:01.38,01:14:01.38,"guy."" Okay, the out-play portion of"
1051,01:14:05.46,01:14:05.46,"Survivor, in my book, revolves around the competitions."
1052,01:14:09.04,01:14:09.04,"So what I want you to do is rate yourself, one through ten,"
1053,01:14:13.08,01:14:13.08,and why you gave yourself a one to ten rating.
1054,01:14:16.29,01:14:16.29,Aras. >> I give myself a nine.
1055,01:14:19.25,01:14:19.25,I busted my butt at every challenge.
1056,01:14:21.17,01:14:21.17,"And I think everybody here did, basically."
1057,01:14:23.17,01:14:23.17,"I don't know anybody who wasn't, like, pumped up for a"
1058,01:14:25.00,01:14:25.00,"challenge, and I have no regrets about any of the"
1059,01:14:27.67,01:14:27.67,"challenges, except maybe wishing I got a peg in"
1060,01:14:31.12,01:14:31.12,"somewhere quicker than somebody else got a peg in, or something"
1061,01:14:33.62,01:14:33.62,like that. >> Danielle.
1062,01:14:35.88,01:14:35.88,">> I would give myself an eight and a half, nine, only because"
1063,01:14:40.12,01:14:40.12,I would give myself higher if I didn't take the cheeseburger
1064,01:14:44.04,01:14:44.04,over that challenge. I'm still kicking myself in the
1065,01:14:47.00,01:14:47.00,"ass for that. But every other challenge, I"
1066,01:14:50.46,01:14:50.46,put in 110% on that field. I just gave it my all.
1067,01:14:55.46,01:14:55.46,So I'd say closer to a nine. >> That's it.
1068,01:14:59.12,01:14:59.12,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Thank you, Terry."
1069,01:15:01.04,01:15:01.04,"Austin, you're up. >> First off, congratulations"
1070,01:15:07.92,01:15:07.92,"to the both of you. Aras, sorry to hear about your"
1071,01:15:10.04,01:15:10.04,"hand, man. What I want you guys to do, I"
1072,01:15:13.12,01:15:13.12,want you to tell me one incident you think you made a
1073,01:15:16.71,01:15:16.71,"very positive, good move, and then one incident that you did"
1074,01:15:20.79,01:15:20.79,something that wasn't necessarily completely on the
1075,01:15:22.46,01:15:22.46,"up-and-up, both of which helped you kind of navigate your way to"
1076,01:15:25.21,01:15:25.21,where you are right now. >> PROBST: We'll start with
1077,01:15:28.33,01:15:28.33,Danielle. >> I think the first move that I
1078,01:15:32.04,01:15:32.04,did that helped me get some control in this game was to
1079,01:15:34.62,01:15:34.62,persuade people not to vote Bruce off and to vote Bob Dog
1080,01:15:39.04,01:15:39.04,off. I just feel like that was the
1081,01:15:40.67,01:15:40.67,first move where I gained a little bit of control in the
1082,01:15:43.04,01:15:43.04,"game. And the second move, obviously,"
1083,01:15:46.25,01:15:46.25,"was voting Courtney off, because Courtney was one of the"
1084,01:15:50.17,01:15:50.17,closest people that I bonded with here.
1085,01:15:54.17,01:15:54.17,That was one of the hardest things I had to do.
1086,01:15:57.46,01:15:57.46,">> Okay, thanks. >> PROBST: Aras."
1087,01:16:01.50,01:16:01.50,>> Probably the... the move that I'm proudest I
1088,01:16:04.67,01:16:04.67,made was telling Melinda she was going to be home.
1089,01:16:06.83,01:16:06.83,To be the second person voted off and to not know you're
1090,01:16:08.92,01:16:08.92,going home... Like Shane didn't know if he was
1091,01:16:11.00,01:16:11.00,"going to stay or not, and Melinda's hopes got up."
1092,01:16:14.25,01:16:14.25,"But I felt good that she at least knew she was going home,"
1093,01:16:16.71,01:16:16.71,as opposed to coming in like super-stoked that she was going
1094,01:16:19.38,01:16:19.38,to make it three more days and get blindsided.
1095,01:16:22.67,01:16:22.67,"Something that I wasn't so proud of: Shane, the vote off for"
1096,01:16:26.08,01:16:26.08,Shane. I had to break the alliance with
1097,01:16:28.25,01:16:28.25,Shane and I ended up saying things to Shane that weren't
1098,01:16:30.96,01:16:30.96,"true, and I felt bad about that. But I do think I played this"
1099,01:16:33.88,01:16:33.88,"game with lots of integrity, and for the most part, every"
1100,01:16:36.38,01:16:36.38,"move I made, I felt really good about."
1101,01:16:39.38,01:16:39.38,>> Congratulations again to the both of you guys.
1102,01:16:41.67,01:16:41.67,">> PROBST: Thanks, Austin. Courtney."
1103,01:16:44.38,01:16:44.38,">> Oh, boy! I forgot my guns."
1104,01:16:52.75,01:16:52.75,They've been dropped in the sea of forgiveness.
1105,01:16:55.79,01:16:55.79,Whew! Wow!
1106,01:16:58.67,01:16:58.67,I came in here wanting to play with integrity and to be of
1107,01:17:02.79,01:17:02.79,"light and love and this shining being, and, wow, did I struggle"
1108,01:17:07.04,01:17:07.04,with that. Because you certainly both
1109,01:17:10.12,01:17:10.12,"stabbed me in the back with a knife that was very deep, and"
1110,01:17:13.33,01:17:13.33,it took me about a week to remove it from my back it was
1111,01:17:16.75,01:17:16.75,"so deep, especially from Danielle, who, which I had"
1112,01:17:20.46,01:17:20.46,total trust in her. I never was going to vote you
1113,01:17:22.92,01:17:22.92,out. I don't know who made up that
1114,01:17:24.58,01:17:24.58,"lie, but I'm holding no chip on my shoulder, because chips on"

1117,01:17:36.17,01:17:36.17,"learned a ton about myself, and that points me to my question."
1118,01:17:40.54,01:17:40.54,"For you and through this experience, more than the game"
1119,01:17:43.42,01:17:43.42,"and the money and the la-la-la-la, what did you really"

1127,01:18:03.88,01:18:03.88,And I and do not profess to say that I was completely honest out
1128,01:18:06.88,01:18:06.88,"here. And so I guess for me, one thing"
1129,01:18:08.96,01:18:08.96,I can say is my ego has been smashed.
1130,01:18:11.25,01:18:11.25,>> And that is going to strengthen your spiritual way.
1131,01:18:14.75,01:18:14.75,"I mean, my ego was smashed into smithereens, and you need it,"
1132,01:18:19.54,01:18:19.54,because it's going to be tough out there.
1133,01:18:21.12,01:18:21.12,>> That's right. >> PROBST: Danielle.
1134,01:18:24.00,01:18:24.00,>> I didn't realize how mentally strong I can be and
1135,01:18:27.12,01:18:27.12,how mentally tough this whole adventure was for me.

1138,01:18:36.42,01:18:36.42,"beautiful gift, then, that this gave you, is that, in a sense,"
1139,01:18:40.00,01:18:40.00,"you've learned to be able to be still within yourself, just"
1140,01:18:43.21,01:18:43.21,"you, not having Dad take care of you or your boyfriend take"
1141,01:18:46.33,01:18:46.33,care of you or anyone. >> Thank you for pointing that

1145,01:18:56.38,01:18:56.38,"something, and we're all going to walk on a higher road."

1148,01:19:14.21,01:19:14.21,I would imagine that you both have realized each other's
1149,01:19:18.54,01:19:18.54,strengths and attributes. I would like both of you to
1150,01:19:22.46,01:19:22.46,tell me why my vote should be for the person sitting next to
1151,01:19:25.54,01:19:25.54,you. >> PROBST: Danielle.
1152,01:19:29.21,01:19:29.21,">> Aras is unbelievable. Honorable, respectful, strong-"

1154,01:19:39.88,01:19:39.88,Just a great person. >> PROBST: Aras.
1155,01:19:45.25,01:19:45.25,">> When I hurt my hand today, Danielle was there, and she"
1156,01:19:49.33,01:19:49.33,walked me up to the beach and just held a towel over my hand
1157,01:19:52.79,01:19:52.79,"to put pressure on it, and just basically helped save my ass."
1158,01:19:56.54,01:19:56.54,On a night where she could just be worrying about what she's
1159,01:19:59.08,01:19:59.08,"going to say to Tribal Council, she put all that aside."
1160,01:20:02.08,01:20:02.08,"That for me was really touching, and to be in that"
1161,01:20:04.21,01:20:04.21,"situation, I felt like, wow, Danielle is a really"
1162,01:20:07.38,01:20:07.38,spectacular person. >> I did tell the doctor
1163,01:20:09.21,01:20:09.21,"to drug you, though. >> She did tell the doctor to"
1164,01:20:11.08,01:20:11.08,"drug me up, which hopefully they'll do later."
1165,01:20:13.38,01:20:13.38,">> I was kidding. >> Good luck, guys."

1167,01:20:25.42,01:20:25.42,">> Fun. First of all, congratulations."
1168,01:20:31.33,01:20:31.33,"The last two, I'm disappointed that it's the both of you."
1169,01:20:36.88,01:20:36.88,I wish that Terry would have been there.
1170,01:20:39.17,01:20:39.17,I believe that Terry is the most deserving person of the 16
1171,01:20:42.79,01:20:42.79,to win the million dollars. I'm going to tell you why I
1172,01:20:46.04,01:20:46.04,think you guys are both undeserving.
1173,01:20:48.50,01:20:48.50,"Danielle, you were useless at camp."
1174,01:20:51.29,01:20:51.29,The only time you were ever motivated to do anything was
1175,01:20:54.12,01:20:54.12,"when it was time to eat. And the outwit part, I don't"
1176,01:20:58.21,01:20:58.21,"know, because at the end of the day, I was with you for 33"
1177,01:21:00.75,01:21:00.75,"days, and I don't know anything about you."
1178,01:21:03.33,01:21:03.33,"I know you can't complete a coherent sentence, and you"
1179,01:21:05.71,01:21:05.71,contradict yourself all the time.
1180,01:21:07.79,01:21:07.79,"And that's a drag. Aras, we had an agreement on"
1181,01:21:13.96,01:21:13.96,"what was most important to both of us, my son and your yoga,"
1182,01:21:18.54,01:21:18.54,"which, at this point, is sort of laughable and contradictory."
1183,01:21:22.46,01:21:22.46,"But we had an agreement, a bond, and when it came time to"
1184,01:21:28.33,01:21:28.33,"make the hard decision, I signed Danielle's name, and you"
1185,01:21:31.50,01:21:31.50,"signed mine. Danielle, you didn't lie to me."
1186,01:21:34.71,01:21:34.71,You played the game straight up. >> I didn't lie to you.
1187,01:21:36.46,01:21:36.46,>> You didn't lie to me at all. I have no beef with the way you
1188,01:21:39.17,01:21:39.17,"played that part of the game. Aras, you lied, you cheated,"
1189,01:21:43.62,01:21:43.62,"and you wrecked me, personally. You know, you're young, you're"
1190,01:21:47.12,01:21:47.12,a good kid. You're striving to do the right
1191,01:21:51.08,01:21:51.08,"thing, but we cannot judge people based on their"
1192,01:21:55.04,01:21:55.04,"intentions. If I'm judged on my intentions,"
1193,01:21:58.00,01:21:58.00,I'd be president of the planet. I have to be judged on my
1194,01:22:01.58,01:22:01.58,"actions, and I've learned that through experience."
1195,01:22:04.50,01:22:04.50,"You are broke, you are homeless and you freeload off your dad."
1196,01:22:08.54,01:22:08.54,So you don't know what it's like to be judged.
1197,01:22:12.29,01:22:12.29,And that is why I cannot vote for you.
1198,01:22:15.21,01:22:15.21,And I don't know who to vote for.
1199,01:22:17.29,01:22:17.29,And I can't abstain. So this is what we're going to
1200,01:22:20.21,01:22:20.21,do. We're going to have a little
1201,01:22:22.12,01:22:22.12,"challenge. Number between one and, very"
1202,01:22:25.54,01:22:25.54,"fittingly, a million. I want you guys both to pick"
1203,01:22:29.25,01:22:29.25,one. >> PROBST: Aras.
1204,01:22:36.17,01:22:36.17,>> Four. >> PROBST: Danielle.
1205,01:22:41.08,01:22:41.08,>> Ten. >> Thank you.
1206,01:22:48.38,01:22:48.38,">> PROBST: Okay, the jury has had their say."
1207,01:22:51.25,01:22:51.25,"Some good questions, some interesting comments, and a"
1208,01:22:54.17,01:22:54.17,challenge. You'll have one last chance to
1209,01:22:57.83,01:22:57.83,make your case about why you deserve the million dollars and
1210,01:23:01.62,01:23:01.62,the title of sole survivor. I'm going to give you a minute
1211,01:23:05.75,01:23:05.75,to think about what you want to say.
1212,01:23:23.08,01:23:23.08,">> PROBST: All right, Danielle and Aras, a lot's been said"
1213,01:23:25.46,01:23:25.46,tonight. This is your last chance to
1214,01:23:28.42,01:23:28.42,"make your case with the jury. Danielle, final comments."
1215,01:23:34.04,01:23:34.04,">> Um, like I said, I wanted to come into this game and be"
1216,01:23:38.21,01:23:38.21,"strong, be myself, form the right alliances, be observant"
1217,01:23:43.17,01:23:43.17,"of what was going on, never feel comfortable, and I feel"
1218,01:23:46.54,01:23:46.54,like I did play this game with honesty and integrity and there
1219,01:23:50.17,01:23:50.17,did come a point when I did have to make a decision to
1220,01:23:53.58,01:23:53.58,deceive somebody that I did align with.
1221,01:23:57.21,01:23:57.21,"Shane, I know you said that I was useless around camp."
1222,01:24:00.08,01:24:00.08,"I feel like I grew a lot, skill-wise."
1223,01:24:04.50,01:24:04.50,"Maybe you didn't see it, but personally, I felt like I grew."
1224,01:24:10.04,01:24:10.04,"And the outwit part of this, I just feel like I aligned with"
1225,01:24:13.50,01:24:13.50,the right people. I found a couple people that
1226,01:24:16.58,01:24:16.58,"I really trusted, and I stuck with them."
1227,01:24:20.04,01:24:20.04,And I'm asking you guys to just look at the three components of
1228,01:24:24.04,01:24:24.04,"this game-- the outwit, the outplay, and outlast-- and I"
1229,01:24:26.92,01:24:26.92,think I did all three of them fairly well.
1230,01:24:29.96,01:24:29.96,I hope you guys vote for me. I have so much going on right
1231,01:24:32.83,01:24:32.83,"now in my life, and this could really help me."
1232,01:24:36.71,01:24:36.71,So there you have it. >> PROBST: Aras.
1233,01:24:46.50,01:24:46.50,">> Guys, again, I know this is a tough choice for all of you,"
1234,01:24:50.79,01:24:50.79,every single one of you. I played this game the best way
1235,01:24:54.04,01:24:54.04,that I knew how. I worked my butt off at camp.
1236,01:24:56.58,01:24:56.58,I worked hard in the challenges. I worked hard at establishing
1237,01:24:59.38,01:24:59.38,"real relationships with each and every one of you, and I"
1238,01:25:02.04,01:25:02.04,"mean that. Shane, I'm really sorry that"
1239,01:25:05.04,01:25:05.04,you think that I was going to try to screw you first.
1240,01:25:09.25,01:25:09.25,I was under the assumption that you were trying to screw me.
1241,01:25:11.17,01:25:11.17,Those hugs that you and I would have at the fireside at night
1242,01:25:13.17,01:25:13.17,"were real, and that was real. So if you're thinking about"
1243,01:25:16.54,01:25:16.54,"voting for someone who needs the money, I'm homeless and"
1244,01:25:18.75,01:25:18.75,I freeload off my dad. Help me get out of that
1245,01:25:20.83,01:25:20.83,"situation, brother. But honestly, guys, we all"
1246,01:25:23.42,01:25:23.42,played it the best way we know how.
1247,01:25:25.50,01:25:25.50,"I hope you guys can look at the situation and say, ""Wow, Aras"
1248,01:25:28.08,01:25:28.08,"played it really well."" if you guys say D played it"
1249,01:25:30.33,01:25:30.33,"better, that's cool, too. It was a real challenging"
1250,01:25:33.04,01:25:33.04,"experience, and my closing words are just thank you guys"
1251,01:25:36.75,01:25:36.75,for being a part of that experience.
