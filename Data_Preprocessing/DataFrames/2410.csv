883,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,DIFFERENT.
884,00:28:07.67,00:28:07.67,I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNOW
885,00:28:08.93,00:28:08.93,EVERYONE'S AGAINST ME.
886,00:28:10.03,00:28:10.03,IF THERE WERE SEVEN PEOPLE

901,00:28:29.00,00:28:29.00,OKAY.
902,00:28:29.67,00:28:29.67,THIS THING FEELS OUTSTANDING.
903,00:28:32.83,00:28:32.83,IT IS LIKE A-- IT CHANGES MY
904,00:28:35.07,00:28:35.07,WHOLE DAY.
905,00:28:36.47,00:28:36.47,IT CHANGES EVERYBODY ELSE'S
906,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"HAPPY-GO-LUCKY MOOD TO, NOW"
907,00:28:40.90,00:28:40.90,WHAT?
908,00:28:41.83,00:28:41.83,PARANOIA.
909,00:28:42.23,00:28:42.23,DOES HE HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL AS
910,00:28:43.90,00:28:43.90,WELL?
911,00:28:44.27,00:28:44.27,IT'S LIKE THEIR WORST-CASE
912,00:28:46.27,00:28:46.27,"SCENARIO, THEIR WORST-CASE"
913,00:28:48.13,00:28:48.13,SCENARIO.
914,00:28:48.37,00:28:48.37,TROY WINS.
915,00:28:54.07,00:28:54.07,THOUGHT.
916,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,HUH?
917,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,THOUGHTS?
918,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,"WELL, WHAT I THOUGHT IS WE"
919,00:29:02.10,00:29:02.10,KEEP OUR STRONGEST WOMEN IN TILL
920,00:29:03.80,00:29:03.80,WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT.
921,00:29:05.10,00:29:05.10,ABSOLUTELY.
922,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,THE SECOND THOUGHT IS HE HAS
923,00:29:07.10,00:29:07.10,AN IDOL.
924,00:29:07.70,00:29:07.70,YOU THINK?
925,00:29:08.17,00:29:08.17,I THINK.
926,00:29:10.60,00:29:10.60,"THEN MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS, IF"
927,00:29:14.43,00:29:14.43,"WE TOOK ANOTHER GUY OUT, I'D SAY"
928,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63,LEIF.
929,00:29:16.97,00:29:16.97,BUT THEN IT'S LIKE THAT'S
930,00:29:20.33,00:29:20.33,SOMEONE WE COULD BEAT OVER A
931,00:29:21.53,00:29:21.53,GIRL.
932,00:29:22.00,00:29:22.00,BUT IF WE TAKE A GIRL IT'S JUST
933,00:29:23.10,00:29:23.10,GOING TO--
934,00:29:23.77,00:29:23.77,I THINK-- THAT'S MY THOUGHT.
935,00:29:25.80,00:29:25.80,I THINK AS LONG AS LEIF'S HEREWE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.
936,00:29:27.93,00:29:27.93,"IF WE TRY TO PULL A MOVE, HE'LLFEEL IT, HE'LL GET WIND OF IT.HE'LL FLIP EVERYTHING UPSIDEDOWN."
937,00:29:34.93,00:29:34.93,THE ONE THING ALL OF US
938,00:29:36.20,00:29:36.20,DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN TODAY WAS
939,00:29:37.90,00:29:37.90,FOR TROY TO WIN AND IT HAPPENED.
940,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,SO IMMEDIATELY YOU START TO
941,00:29:42.17,00:29:42.17,THINK ABOUT TRIBAL.
942,00:29:42.73,00:29:42.73,I THINK IF WE WERE TO TAKE A
943,00:29:44.20,00:29:44.20,"GIRL OUT RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD DO"
944,00:29:45.93,00:29:45.93,NOTHING BUT CREATE CHAOS AND
945,00:29:48.53,00:29:48.53,"PARANOIA, AND THAT'S THE LAST"
946,00:29:50.00,00:29:50.00,THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW.
947,00:29:51.37,00:29:51.37,SO IT'S EASY TO TAKE EITHER
948,00:29:54.73,00:29:54.73,TARZAN OUT OR LEIF OUT.
949,00:30:00.20,00:30:00.20,SO EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT?
950,00:30:02.80,00:30:02.80,WHAT.
951,00:30:03.40,00:30:03.40,EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT.
952,00:30:04.60,00:30:04.60,YOU OR ME.
953,00:30:05.60,00:30:05.60,ONE OF THE TWO OF US.

955,00:30:08.07,00:30:08.07,MAYBE.
956,00:30:08.57,00:30:08.57,YOU DON'T KNOW.
957,00:30:10.03,00:30:10.03,THEY MAY GO AFTER--
958,00:30:10.97,00:30:10.97,HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY AT
959,00:30:12.80,00:30:12.80,ALL?
960,00:30:13.17,00:30:13.17,THEY'RE BEING VERY COY.
961,00:30:14.87,00:30:14.87,SO I DON'T CARE.
962,00:30:15.93,00:30:15.93,YEAH.
963,00:30:16.47,00:30:16.47,I SHOULD HAVE WON TODAY.
964,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,THEN I'D BE SAFE.
965,00:30:20.10,00:30:20.10,BUT I COULDN'T-- I COULDN'T BEAT
966,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,HIM.
967,00:30:22.73,00:30:22.73,HE'S TOO GOOD.
968,00:30:23.23,00:30:23.23,THE BEST STRATEGY FOR ME
969,00:30:24.83,00:30:24.83,TONIGHT IS I'M GOING TO TALK TO
970,00:30:26.70,00:30:26.70,"LEIF, CHRISTINA, ALAES, AND"
971,00:30:29.93,00:30:29.93,TARZAN.
972,00:30:30.30,00:30:30.30,"I'M GOING TO BE POINT BLANK,"
973,00:30:32.80,00:30:32.80,"LIKE, YOU ARE ON THE BOTTOM."
974,00:30:34.27,00:30:34.27,SO IF YOU'RE STOCK MARKET COME
975,00:30:35.27,00:30:35.27,"ALONG WITH ME, AND WE HAVE FIVE"
976,00:30:36.90,00:30:36.90,"VOTES, AND WE VOTE OUT KIM."
977,00:30:38.27,00:30:38.27,LOOK AT THIS.
978,00:30:39.37,00:30:39.37,HERE'S THE SCENARIO.

980,00:30:44.57,00:30:44.57,THOSE ARE FOUR STRONG PLAYERS.
981,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23,SO NOW I HAVE THE IMMUNITY
982,00:30:48.97,00:30:48.97,NECKLACE.

985,00:30:51.13,00:30:51.13,I KNOW.
986,00:30:51.60,00:30:51.60,AND IF YOU GET RID OF ONE OF
987,00:30:53.37,00:30:53.37,"THOSE PLAYERS, THEN ALL OF A"
988,00:30:54.73,00:30:54.73,"SUDDEN, YOU CAN PICK THEM ALL"

1011,00:31:23.87,00:31:23.87,"THE WORST WOULD BE, LIKE,"
1012,00:31:25.47,00:31:25.47,PROBABLY IF YOU THEY DECIDE TO

1154,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF IT'S MEN"

1164,00:36:11.40,00:36:11.40,I THINK TROY IS TRYING TO SWITCHAND GET ALL THE PEOPLE TOGETHERON HIS SIDE.
1165,00:36:15.27,00:36:15.27,"BUT IT'S, LIKE, TARZAN, LEIF,AND CHRISTINA ARE GOING NEXT.IT'S THE FACTS."
1166,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87,"KIM, CHELSEA, SABRINA, AND KAT."
1167,00:36:24.30,00:36:24.30,THOSE FOUR CAN DO WHATEVER THEYWANT.
1168,00:36:27.67,00:36:27.67,"I TOLD THESE GUYS TODAY, LISTEN,"
1169,00:36:29.30,00:36:29.30,"RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE MY VOTE."

1177,00:36:43.77,00:36:43.77,IT RIGHT NOW.
1178,00:36:45.97,00:36:45.97,IF THEY WOULD VOTE KIM OUT.
1179,00:36:48.70,00:36:48.70,THAT'S ALL IT WOULD TAKE.
1180,00:36:50.23,00:36:50.23,BUT WHAT YOU'RE PROMISINGTHEM IS ONLY GOING TO WORK IFYOU WIN EVERY SINGLE IMMUNITYCHALLENGE.
1181,00:36:56.30,00:36:56.30,"NO, IT'S NOT."
1182,00:36:57.13,00:36:57.13,I BEAT YOU ON THE LAST ONE.

1184,00:36:59.33,00:36:59.33,YOU ARE BEATABLE.
1185,00:37:00.40,00:37:00.40,"IF WE'RE A GROUP, YOU DON'T"

1192,00:37:08.90,00:37:08.90,THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE WE
1193,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,WOULD HAVE FIVE AGAINST FOUR.
1194,00:37:11.77,00:37:11.77,YOU CAN'T.
1195,00:37:13.83,00:37:13.83,TO ME THE FAULT WITH ALL OF

1199,00:37:22.03,00:37:22.03,WHO IS WITH WHO.
1200,00:37:24.20,00:37:24.20,IF IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND
1201,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,CHRISTINA AND ALICIA WERE AT THE
1202,00:37:27.97,00:37:27.97,BOTTOM THAT WOULD BE THE TRUTH.
1203,00:37:29.07,00:37:29.07,THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
1204,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,"Jeff: KRISTINA, WALK ME"

1208,00:37:40.20,00:37:40.20,REALLY INTERESTING PROPOSITION.
1209,00:37:42.70,00:37:42.70,IT'S BASIC MATH.
1210,00:37:43.70,00:37:43.70,FIVE AGAINST FOUR.
1211,00:37:44.47,00:37:44.47,IT ALSO PUTS ME IN AN
1212,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,INTERESTING SITUATION AS WELL.
1213,00:37:46.93,00:37:46.93,"LIKE, I DO BELIEVE IN THE"

1224,00:38:02.93,00:38:02.93,WHAT WOULD DO DO TO THIS GAME?
1225,00:38:05.13,00:38:05.13,IF ANY OF US WOULD SPLIT OR

1227,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,GIRLS WOULD BE SCREWED.
1228,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,IT'S NOT GOING TO ME.
1229,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,IT'S FOR YOURSELVES.
1230,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,I UNDERSTAND THAT.
1231,00:38:13.23,00:38:13.23,I ALSO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS
1232,00:38:15.33,00:38:15.33,CHRISTINA.
1233,00:38:15.67,00:38:15.67,DO I TRUST SOMEBODY ALL OF ASUDDEN NOW?

1236,00:38:20.27,00:38:20.27,WHEN DO I MAKE A MOVE?
1237,00:38:21.53,00:38:21.53,"YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M"

1242,00:38:31.33,00:38:31.33,YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM.
1243,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
1244,00:38:34.43,00:38:34.43,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
