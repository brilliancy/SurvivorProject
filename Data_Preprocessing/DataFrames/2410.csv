878,00:27:56.70,00:27:56.70,"BUT, PLEASE, IF YOU WIN, BE NOBLE."
879,00:28:00.10,00:28:00.10,IT LOOKS BAD.
880,00:28:02.13,00:28:02.13,I'M HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

883,00:28:06.20,00:28:06.20,EVERYONE'S PERSONALITY IS
884,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,DIFFERENT.
885,00:28:07.67,00:28:07.67,I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNOW
886,00:28:08.93,00:28:08.93,EVERYONE'S AGAINST ME.
887,00:28:10.03,00:28:10.03,IF THERE WERE SEVEN PEOPLE
888,00:28:10.93,00:28:10.93,AGAINST YOU AND YOU JUST FELT
889,00:28:12.37,00:28:12.37,"LIKE YOU BEAT SEVEN PEOPLE, YOU"
890,00:28:13.87,00:28:13.87,"MIGHT SCREAM, TOO."
891,00:28:15.43,00:28:15.43,I CAN'T CHANGE MY PERSONALITY
892,00:28:17.07,00:28:17.07,"MIDSTREAM AND BE LIKE, OH, I"
893,00:28:18.63,00:28:18.63,WANT TO BE SOME NOBLE GUY AND

900,00:28:26.87,00:28:26.87,"OKAY, GREAT."
901,00:28:27.90,00:28:27.90,I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD.
902,00:28:29.00,00:28:29.00,OKAY.
903,00:28:29.67,00:28:29.67,THIS THING FEELS OUTSTANDING.
904,00:28:32.83,00:28:32.83,IT IS LIKE A-- IT CHANGES MY
905,00:28:35.07,00:28:35.07,WHOLE DAY.
906,00:28:36.47,00:28:36.47,IT CHANGES EVERYBODY ELSE'S
907,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"HAPPY-GO-LUCKY MOOD TO, NOW"
908,00:28:40.90,00:28:40.90,WHAT?
909,00:28:41.83,00:28:41.83,PARANOIA.
910,00:28:42.23,00:28:42.23,DOES HE HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL AS
911,00:28:43.90,00:28:43.90,WELL?
912,00:28:44.27,00:28:44.27,IT'S LIKE THEIR WORST-CASE
913,00:28:46.27,00:28:46.27,"SCENARIO, THEIR WORST-CASE"
914,00:28:48.13,00:28:48.13,SCENARIO.
915,00:28:48.37,00:28:48.37,TROY WINS.
916,00:28:54.07,00:28:54.07,THOUGHT.
917,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,HUH?
918,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,THOUGHTS?
919,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,"WELL, WHAT I THOUGHT IS WE"
920,00:29:02.10,00:29:02.10,KEEP OUR STRONGEST WOMEN IN TILL
921,00:29:03.80,00:29:03.80,WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT.
922,00:29:05.10,00:29:05.10,ABSOLUTELY.
923,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,THE SECOND THOUGHT IS HE HAS
924,00:29:07.10,00:29:07.10,AN IDOL.
925,00:29:07.70,00:29:07.70,YOU THINK?
926,00:29:08.17,00:29:08.17,I THINK.
927,00:29:10.60,00:29:10.60,"THEN MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS, IF"
928,00:29:14.43,00:29:14.43,"WE TOOK ANOTHER GUY OUT, I'D SAY"
929,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63,LEIF.
930,00:29:16.97,00:29:16.97,BUT THEN IT'S LIKE THAT'S
931,00:29:20.33,00:29:20.33,SOMEONE WE COULD BEAT OVER A
932,00:29:21.53,00:29:21.53,GIRL.
933,00:29:22.00,00:29:22.00,BUT IF WE TAKE A GIRL IT'S JUST
934,00:29:23.10,00:29:23.10,GOING TO--
935,00:29:23.77,00:29:23.77,I THINK-- THAT'S MY THOUGHT.
936,00:29:25.80,00:29:25.80,I THINK AS LONG AS LEIF'S HERE WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.
937,00:29:27.93,00:29:27.93,"IF WE TRY TO PULL A MOVE, HE'LL FEEL IT, HE'LL GET WIND OF IT. HE'LL FLIP EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN."
938,00:29:34.93,00:29:34.93,THE ONE THING ALL OF US
939,00:29:36.20,00:29:36.20,DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN TODAY WAS
940,00:29:37.90,00:29:37.90,FOR TROY TO WIN AND IT HAPPENED.
941,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,SO IMMEDIATELY YOU START TO
942,00:29:42.17,00:29:42.17,THINK ABOUT TRIBAL.
943,00:29:42.73,00:29:42.73,I THINK IF WE WERE TO TAKE A
944,00:29:44.20,00:29:44.20,"GIRL OUT RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD DO"
945,00:29:45.93,00:29:45.93,NOTHING BUT CREATE CHAOS AND
946,00:29:48.53,00:29:48.53,"PARANOIA, AND THAT'S THE LAST"
947,00:29:50.00,00:29:50.00,THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW.
948,00:29:51.37,00:29:51.37,SO IT'S EASY TO TAKE EITHER
949,00:29:54.73,00:29:54.73,TARZAN OUT OR LEIF OUT.
950,00:30:00.20,00:30:00.20,SO EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT?
951,00:30:02.80,00:30:02.80,WHAT.
952,00:30:03.40,00:30:03.40,EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT.
953,00:30:04.60,00:30:04.60,YOU OR ME.
954,00:30:05.60,00:30:05.60,ONE OF THE TWO OF US.
955,00:30:06.73,00:30:06.73,YEAH.
956,00:30:08.07,00:30:08.07,MAYBE.
957,00:30:08.57,00:30:08.57,YOU DON'T KNOW.
958,00:30:10.03,00:30:10.03,THEY MAY GO AFTER--
959,00:30:10.97,00:30:10.97,HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY AT
960,00:30:12.80,00:30:12.80,ALL?
961,00:30:13.17,00:30:13.17,THEY'RE BEING VERY COY.
962,00:30:14.87,00:30:14.87,SO I DON'T CARE.
963,00:30:15.93,00:30:15.93,YEAH.
964,00:30:16.47,00:30:16.47,I SHOULD HAVE WON TODAY.
965,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,THEN I'D BE SAFE.
966,00:30:20.10,00:30:20.10,BUT I COULDN'T-- I COULDN'T BEAT
967,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,HIM.
968,00:30:22.73,00:30:22.73,HE'S TOO GOOD.
969,00:30:23.23,00:30:23.23,THE BEST STRATEGY FOR ME
970,00:30:24.83,00:30:24.83,TONIGHT IS I'M GOING TO TALK TO
971,00:30:26.70,00:30:26.70,"LEIF, CHRISTINA, ALAES, AND"
972,00:30:29.93,00:30:29.93,TARZAN.
973,00:30:30.30,00:30:30.30,"I'M GOING TO BE POINT BLANK,"
974,00:30:32.80,00:30:32.80,"LIKE, YOU ARE ON THE BOTTOM."
975,00:30:34.27,00:30:34.27,SO IF YOU'RE STOCK MARKET COME
976,00:30:35.27,00:30:35.27,"ALONG WITH ME, AND WE HAVE FIVE"
977,00:30:36.90,00:30:36.90,"VOTES, AND WE VOTE OUT KIM."
978,00:30:38.27,00:30:38.27,LOOK AT THIS.
979,00:30:39.37,00:30:39.37,HERE'S THE SCENARIO.
980,00:30:40.30,00:30:40.30,"IT'S KIM, CHELSEA, KAT, SABRINA."
981,00:30:44.57,00:30:44.57,THOSE ARE FOUR STRONG PLAYERS.
982,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23,SO NOW I HAVE THE IMMUNITY
983,00:30:48.97,00:30:48.97,NECKLACE.
984,00:30:49.33,00:30:49.33,YOU GUYS HAVE A CHANCE TO DO

986,00:30:51.13,00:30:51.13,I KNOW.
987,00:30:51.60,00:30:51.60,AND IF YOU GET RID OF ONE OF
988,00:30:53.37,00:30:53.37,"THOSE PLAYERS, THEN ALL OF A"
989,00:30:54.73,00:30:54.73,"SUDDEN, YOU CAN PICK THEM ALL"
990,00:30:56.83,00:30:56.83,OFF.

993,00:30:59.70,00:30:59.70,COULD PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE.
994,00:31:01.93,00:31:01.93,IT WOULD NOT BE THAT DIFFICULT.
995,00:31:03.70,00:31:03.70,TO ME THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE THAT
996,00:31:05.20,00:31:05.20,"ARE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, TREATED"
997,00:31:06.57,00:31:06.57,LIKE THEY'RE THE BOTTOM.

1011,00:31:22.83,00:31:22.83,THAT WOULD BE THE BEST SCENARIO.
1012,00:31:23.87,00:31:23.87,"THE WORST WOULD BE, LIKE,"
1013,00:31:25.47,00:31:25.47,PROBABLY IF YOU THEY DECIDE TO

1091,00:34:03.27,00:34:03.27,AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY I
1092,00:34:06.23,00:34:06.23,PLAYED.
1093,00:34:06.63,00:34:06.63,IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WASN'T A
1094,00:34:07.93,00:34:07.93,SOUL THAT WAS ROOTING FOR ME.
1095,00:34:08.93,00:34:08.93,WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU

1102,00:34:19.20,00:34:19.20,AND YOU SAID ( BLEEP ) YOU.
1103,00:34:21.83,00:34:21.83,"NO, I SAID DON'T ( BLEEP )"
1104,00:34:23.87,00:34:23.87,WITH ME.
1105,00:34:24.37,00:34:24.37,THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
1106,00:34:25.17,00:34:25.17,DO YOU EXPECT FOR TO US HAVE A GREAT RECIPROCITY.
1107,00:34:28.07,00:34:28.07,"NO, WHILE THE THING WAS GOING ON YOU GUYS COULD GIVE A CRAP."
1108,00:34:31.23,00:34:31.23,DON'T MAKE US LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUYS.
1109,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,I'M NOT MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE ANYTHING.
1110,00:34:34.97,00:34:34.97,YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELVES LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU ARE.
1111,00:34:35.67,00:34:35.67,"YOU'RE A GREAT COMPETITOR,"
1112,00:34:37.37,00:34:37.37,BUT IN THE LAST 48 HOURS I HAVE

1114,00:34:41.87,00:34:41.87,IT'S SO TERRIBLE.

1116,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,BIG DEAL.
1117,00:34:46.43,00:34:46.43,DO YOU THINK I REALLY CARE?
1118,00:34:47.70,00:34:47.70,I'M SAYING YOU CAN'T BE ALL

1126,00:35:04.10,00:35:04.10,YOU DID SAY THAT.
1127,00:35:05.37,00:35:05.37,WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WRONG.
1128,00:35:06.23,00:35:06.23,I'M JUST SPEAKING THE TRUTH.
1129,00:35:07.60,00:35:07.60,IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH--
1130,00:35:10.97,00:35:10.97,"THIS IS TRUTH IN ""SURVIVOR."""
1131,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,THERE IS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH
1132,00:35:15.13,00:35:15.13,COMING FROM SABRINA WHO

1139,00:35:24.20,00:35:24.20,YES OR NO.
1140,00:35:25.13,00:35:25.13,NO.
1141,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,"OH, YEAH, RIGHT."
1142,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,"WHY ARE YOU GETTING UPSET,"
1143,00:35:29.50,00:35:29.50,DUDE?
1144,00:35:29.80,00:35:29.80,I'M NOT GETTING UPSET.

1146,00:35:32.20,00:35:32.20,I'M NOT RAISING MY VOICE.
1147,00:35:33.47,00:35:33.47,I'M NOT EITHER.
1148,00:35:34.70,00:35:34.70,THIS IS MY TONE OF VOICE.
1149,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,THIS IS MY TONE OF VOICE AS
1150,00:35:38.80,00:35:38.80,WELL.
1151,00:35:42.73,00:35:42.73,"Jeff: CHELSEA, IN THE"
1152,00:35:44.27,00:35:44.27,"CONTEXT OF COMPETITION, YOU'VE"
1153,00:35:47.27,00:35:47.27,GOT TO RESPECT A GUY WHO IS
1154,00:35:49.63,00:35:49.63,FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS GAME
1155,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF IT'S MEN"
1156,00:35:52.37,00:35:52.37,"VERSUS WOMEN, YOU HAVE THREE"
1157,00:35:53.53,00:35:53.53,"GUYS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE, UNLESS"
1158,00:35:55.13,00:35:55.13,SOMETHING HAPPENS.
1159,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"YEAH, AND TODAY THE WHOLE"
1160,00:35:59.07,00:35:59.07,PARANOIA THING SET IN.
1161,00:36:00.07,00:36:00.07,AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE OLD MANONO.
1162,00:36:03.70,00:36:03.70,Jeff: WHO IS THE OLD
1163,00:36:04.73,00:36:04.73,MANONO.
1164,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"THERE'S TARZAN, LEIF, CHRISTINA,  ALICIA, AND OF COURSE"
1165,00:36:11.40,00:36:11.40,I THINK TROY IS TRYING TO SWITCH AND GET ALL THE PEOPLE TOGETHER ON HIS SIDE.
1166,00:36:15.27,00:36:15.27,"BUT IT'S, LIKE, TARZAN, LEIF, AND CHRISTINA ARE GOING NEXT. IT'S THE FACTS."
1167,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87,"KIM, CHELSEA, SABRINA, AND KAT."
1168,00:36:24.30,00:36:24.30,THOSE FOUR CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
1169,00:36:27.67,00:36:27.67,"I TOLD THESE GUYS TODAY, LISTEN,"
1170,00:36:29.30,00:36:29.30,"RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE MY VOTE."
1171,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,AND YOU HAVE MY FOR IMMUNITIES.
1172,00:36:33.27,00:36:33.27,BUT YOU CAN GO FROM GETTING
1173,00:36:34.97,00:36:34.97,"VOTED OUT TONIGHT, TARZAN,"
1174,00:36:36.77,00:36:36.77,"GETTING VOTED OUT TONIGHT, LEIF,"

1176,00:36:41.07,00:36:41.07,AUTOMATICALLY GUARANTEE YOURSELF
1177,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,"TO BE AT FIVE, AND THEY CAN DO"
1178,00:36:43.77,00:36:43.77,IT RIGHT NOW.
1179,00:36:45.97,00:36:45.97,IF THEY WOULD VOTE KIM OUT.
1180,00:36:48.70,00:36:48.70,THAT'S ALL IT WOULD TAKE.
1181,00:36:50.23,00:36:50.23,BUT WHAT YOU'RE PROMISING THEM IS ONLY GOING TO WORK IF YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
1182,00:36:56.30,00:36:56.30,"NO, IT'S NOT."
1183,00:36:57.13,00:36:57.13,I BEAT YOU ON THE LAST ONE.
1184,00:36:58.40,00:36:58.40,THAT'S NOT TRUE.
1185,00:36:59.33,00:36:59.33,YOU ARE BEATABLE.
1186,00:37:00.40,00:37:00.40,"IF WE'RE A GROUP, YOU DON'T"
1187,00:37:02.47,00:37:02.47,"GET IMMUNITY, WE VOTE SABRINA"
1188,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,OUT.
1189,00:37:05.37,00:37:05.37,IF WE'RE SMART WE VOTE KIM OUT
1190,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,TONIGHT.
1191,00:37:07.07,00:37:07.07,"IF YOU DON'T GET IMMUNITY, WE"
1192,00:37:08.30,00:37:08.30,VOTE YOU OUT.
1193,00:37:08.90,00:37:08.90,THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE WE
1194,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,WOULD HAVE FIVE AGAINST FOUR.
1195,00:37:11.77,00:37:11.77,YOU CAN'T.
1196,00:37:13.83,00:37:13.83,TO ME THE FAULT WITH ALL OF
1197,00:37:15.77,00:37:15.77,THIS LOGIC IS EVERYBODY IS
1198,00:37:16.97,00:37:16.97,"MAKING A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS, AND"
1199,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,NOBODY KNOWS WHO LIES WHERE AND
1200,00:37:22.03,00:37:22.03,WHO IS WITH WHO.
1201,00:37:24.20,00:37:24.20,IF IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND
1202,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,CHRISTINA AND ALICIA WERE AT THE
1203,00:37:27.97,00:37:27.97,BOTTOM THAT WOULD BE THE TRUTH.
1204,00:37:29.07,00:37:29.07,THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
1205,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,"Jeff: KRISTINA, WALK ME"
1206,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE TO WEIGH
1207,00:37:33.00,00:37:33.00,WHEN YOU HEAR TROYZAN'S PITCH.
1208,00:37:36.73,00:37:36.73,"I MEAN, TROYZAN PUTS OUT A"
1209,00:37:40.20,00:37:40.20,REALLY INTERESTING PROPOSITION.
1210,00:37:42.70,00:37:42.70,IT'S BASIC MATH.
1211,00:37:43.70,00:37:43.70,FIVE AGAINST FOUR.
1212,00:37:44.47,00:37:44.47,IT ALSO PUTS ME IN AN
1213,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,INTERESTING SITUATION AS WELL.
1214,00:37:46.93,00:37:46.93,"LIKE, I DO BELIEVE IN THE"
1215,00:37:48.03,00:37:48.03,ORIGINAL ALLIANCE I HAD FROM THE
1216,00:37:49.77,00:37:49.77,SALANI TRIBE.
1217,00:37:50.27,00:37:50.27,"THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THIS GAME IS"
1218,00:37:52.43,00:37:52.43,ABOUT DECEPTION.
1219,00:37:53.07,00:37:53.07,"THIS GAME IS ABOUT OUTWIT,"
1220,00:37:55.43,00:37:55.43,"OUTLAST, OUTPLAY, SO IT'S GOOD"
1221,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,TO HEAR OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT

1224,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,IF SOMEBODY FLIPS?
1225,00:38:02.93,00:38:02.93,WHAT WOULD DO DO TO THIS GAME?
1226,00:38:05.13,00:38:05.13,IF ANY OF US WOULD SPLIT OR
1227,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"ANY OF US WOULD GO TO TROY, THE"
1228,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,GIRLS WOULD BE SCREWED.
1229,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,IT'S NOT GOING TO ME.
1230,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,IT'S FOR YOURSELVES.
1231,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,I UNDERSTAND THAT.
1232,00:38:13.23,00:38:13.23,I ALSO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS
1233,00:38:15.33,00:38:15.33,CHRISTINA.
1234,00:38:15.67,00:38:15.67,DO I TRUST SOMEBODY ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW?
1235,00:38:17.53,00:38:17.53,Jeff: IT REALLY DOES COME
1236,00:38:18.93,00:38:18.93,"DOWN TO THAT, DOESN'T IT?"
1237,00:38:20.27,00:38:20.27,WHEN DO I MAKE A MOVE?
1238,00:38:21.53,00:38:21.53,"YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M"
1239,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,STRUGGLING WITH.

1243,00:38:31.33,00:38:31.33,YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM.
1244,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
1245,00:38:34.43,00:38:34.43,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1252,00:38:57.70,00:38:57.70,AND IT MAKES EVERYONE FEEL A
1253,00:38:59.60,00:38:59.60,LITTLE UNEASY.
1254,00:39:22.27,00:39:22.27,Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1258,00:39:36.23,00:39:36.23,NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
