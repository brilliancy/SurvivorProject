100,00:03:19.83,00:03:19.83,AND RAN OVER ME FORWARD AND BACKWARDS
101,00:03:22.00,00:03:22.00,AND THEN HAD THE NERVE TO WRITE MY NAME DOWN.
102,00:03:24.12,00:03:24.12,>> SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

210,00:08:28.71,00:08:28.71,AND I WANTED TO LEAVE.
211,00:08:30.21,00:08:30.21,"BUT YOU TALKED ME OUT OF IT,"
212,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"AND YOU WAS LIKE, YOU GOTTA STAY."
213,00:08:33.54,00:08:33.54,WE SAID OUR PRAYERS.
214,00:08:34.54,00:08:34.54,WE DID ALL OF THAT.
215,00:08:35.83,00:08:35.83,MY HEART'S NOT IN THE GAME
216,00:08:38.04,00:08:38.04,LIKE IT SHOULD BE.

221,00:08:44.75,00:08:44.75,I WOULDN'T GIVE IT TO NOBODY ELSE.
222,00:08:46.33,00:08:46.33,"SO, ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE KEY TO THE GAME."
223,00:08:49.75,00:08:49.75,THERE'S THE IDOL.
224,00:08:52.50,00:08:52.50,>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN IT.
225,00:08:56.25,00:08:56.25,>> YEAH?
226,00:08:57.25,00:08:57.25,>> YEAH.
227,00:08:58.46,00:08:58.46,I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
228,00:08:59.79,00:08:59.79,"I KNEW IT WAS A KEY, BUT I AIN'T SEEN IT."
229,00:09:01.79,00:09:01.79,>> YEAH.

232,00:09:05.38,00:09:05.38,NAONKA GAVE ME IDOL
233,00:09:07.83,00:09:07.83,"BECAUSE SHE THINKS I CAN DO WELL WITH IT, I GUESS,"
234,00:09:09.58,00:09:09.58,AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL HELP ME OUT IN THE LONG RUN.
235,00:09:12.54,00:09:12.54,>> YOU JUST GOT TO WORK YOUR MAGIC.
236,00:09:14.42,00:09:14.42,NOW YOU GOT TO TURN YOUR SWAG ON.
237,00:09:16.21,00:09:16.21,">> IF NAONKA DOESN'T QUIT,"
238,00:09:17.88,00:09:17.88,THEN I'M STILL NOT GOING TO GIVE HER THE IDOL BACK.
239,00:09:19.58,00:09:19.58,>> DON'T GET SCATTER BRAINED.
240,00:09:20.88,00:09:20.88,YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
241,00:09:24.88,00:09:24.88,>> YOU AND I AND SASH AND CHASE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.

243,00:09:29.29,00:09:29.29,">> YEAH, TOP FOUR, BABY."
244,00:09:30.88,00:09:30.88,THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.
245,00:09:32.17,00:09:32.17,>> BECAUSE IF KELLY DECIDES TO STAY IN...
246,00:09:34.29,00:09:34.29,">> NO, SHE'S GOING THROUGH..."
247,00:09:36.17,00:09:36.17,>> SHE MIGHT CHANGE HER MIND AFTER SHE GETS WARM.
248,00:09:38.58,00:09:38.58,"BUT SEE, RIGHT NOW,"
249,00:09:41.58,00:09:41.58,"I THINK SASH IS GOING TO STAY WITH US,"
250,00:09:43.50,00:09:43.50,BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT DANNY...
251,00:09:45.21,00:09:45.21,>> THERE'S THREE OF THEM.
252,00:09:46.79,00:09:46.79,>> THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM?
253,00:09:48.21,00:09:48.21,">> YEAH, DANNY, BENRY, AND FABIO."
254,00:09:50.17,00:09:50.17,">> OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT."
255,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,"IF PURPLE KELLY AND NAONKA DECIDE TO LEAVE,"
256,00:09:56.08,00:09:56.08,I THINK WE STILL HAVE A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE
257,00:09:59.29,00:09:59.29,"BETWEEN SASH, HOLLY, CHASE AND ME,"
258,00:10:03.79,00:10:03.79,SO THAT ONLY LEAVES THE OTHER THREE PEOPLE
259,00:10:06.38,00:10:06.38,"ON THEIR OWN,"
260,00:10:08.25,00:10:08.25,"AND IF WE KEEP FOUR STRONG,"
261,00:10:09.38,00:10:09.38,WE CAN VOTE THEM OUT.
262,00:10:11.12,00:10:11.12,>> HERE'S MY THING.
263,00:10:13.75,00:10:13.75,US THREE AND JANE.
264,00:10:15.25,00:10:15.25,>> RIGHT.
265,00:10:16.25,00:10:16.25,>> YEAH
266,00:10:17.25,00:10:17.25,>> THIS IS NO...
267,00:10:18.29,00:10:18.29,I'M NOT FLOPPING.
268,00:10:19.29,00:10:19.29,>> YOU DON'T... YOU CAN'T!
269,00:10:20.38,00:10:20.38,>> OBVIOUSLY NOT.
270,00:10:21.42,00:10:21.42,I'D BE STUPID TO.
271,00:10:22.71,00:10:22.71,>> BECAUSE YOU LEARNED FROM THE FIRST TIME.
272,00:10:23.92,00:10:23.92,"LOOK IF YOU HAD FLOPPED WITH BRENDA,"
273,00:10:25.25,00:10:25.25,YOU'D BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.
274,00:10:26.75,00:10:26.75,>> I KNOW.
275,00:10:27.83,00:10:27.83,"I DO NOT TRUST CHASE, HOLLY AND JANE"
276,00:10:32.21,00:10:32.21,AS MUCH AS I DO PURPLE KELLY AND NAONKA
277,00:10:34.58,00:10:34.58,BECAUSE THEY'RE THE TWO
278,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,THAT I'M CLOSEST WITH AT LIBERTAD.
279,00:10:38.38,00:10:38.38,SO THE PERSON THAT DOES NOT BENEFIT THE MOST IS ME.
280,00:10:43.33,00:10:43.33,IT CROSSED MY MIND TO TEAM UP
281,00:10:45.42,00:10:45.42,"WITH BENRY, FABIO, AND DAN,"
282,00:10:47.46,00:10:47.46,BUT I ABSOLUTE WISH NAONKA AND PURPLE KELLY WOULD STAY.
283,00:11:11.75,00:11:11.75,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!"

617,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,SHE LIKES DOING NICE THINGS FOR PEOPLE.
618,00:23:38.54,00:23:38.54,IT WAS GREAT FOR ME.
619,00:23:40.50,00:23:40.50,I WASN'T GOING ON THE REWARD ANYWAY.
620,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,SO NOW WE'VE GOT EXTRA RICE AND AN EXTRA TARP.

758,00:28:51.58,00:28:51.58,"WE WERE LAUGHING, BUT, YOU KNOW,"
759,00:28:53.79,00:28:53.79,NAONKA DEFINITELY CONCERNS ME A LITTLE BIT.
760,00:28:56.00,00:28:56.00,"THE WHOLE TIME I WAS JUST THINKING,"
761,00:28:58.38,00:28:58.38,"YOU KNOW, PLEASE LEAVE, PLEASE LEAVE."
762,00:29:00.88,00:29:00.88,GET OUT OF THIS GAME AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR ME.
763,00:29:10.29,00:29:10.29,(LAUGHTER)

770,00:29:28.42,00:29:28.42,TO HAVE THIS ENERGY.
771,00:29:29.83,00:29:29.83,AND I JUST FEED OFF THAT ENERGY
772,00:29:31.29,00:29:31.29,AND IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL EXPLOSIVE.
773,00:29:32.71,00:29:32.71,YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE LIFE WILL TAKE YOU.
774,00:29:34.42,00:29:34.42,IT MADE ME REALIZE
775,00:29:35.88,00:29:35.88,THAT I HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO PERSPECTIVE.
776,00:29:38.25,00:29:38.25,"IF I STAYED,"

783,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,ONE OF THE SMARTEST DECISIONS YOU YOU COULD HAVE MADE.
784,00:30:01.58,00:30:01.58,">> THANKS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?"
785,00:30:02.88,00:30:02.88,JANE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.
786,00:30:04.17,00:30:04.17,>> I KNOW.
787,00:30:05.21,00:30:05.21,>> YEAH.
788,00:30:06.54,00:30:06.54,>> I WANT TO WIN.
789,00:30:08.08,00:30:08.08,QUITTING HAS NOT CROSSED MY MIND.

791,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,"WHICH AUTOMATICALLY IS NOT FUN, YOU KNOW."
792,00:30:13.96,00:30:13.96,AND PURPLE KELLY AND NAONKA
793,00:30:16.29,00:30:16.29,ARE GOING TO DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO GO HOME.
794,00:30:18.25,00:30:18.25,SO WE'LL SEE.
795,00:30:19.25,00:30:19.25,IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING.
796,00:30:20.50,00:30:20.50,">> WHEN JEFF SAID TODAY THAT, LIKE,"
797,00:30:22.75,00:30:22.75,"TAKING THE TARP AND THE RICE COULD REALLY, LIKE,"
798,00:30:25.25,00:30:25.25,MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR GAME.
799,00:30:26.62,00:30:26.62,"I THINK THAT IT, LIKE, DEFINITELY CAN."
800,00:30:28.75,00:30:28.75,>> THINK POSITIVE.
801,00:30:30.04,00:30:30.04,>> ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TONIGHT.
802,00:30:31.92,00:30:31.92,NOTHING IS SET.
803,00:30:33.58,00:30:33.58,AND I THINK THAT'S THE SCARIEST PART.
804,00:30:35.21,00:30:35.21,THE TARP AND THE RICE
805,00:30:37.12,00:30:37.12,CANNOT REALLY GET ME THROUGH THE NEXT 11 DAYS.
806,00:30:39.38,00:30:39.38,"I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IT CAN,"
807,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,BUT I JUST NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
808,00:30:43.96,00:30:43.96,>> THAT'S A LOT OF RICE.
809,00:30:45.08,00:30:45.08,>> I THINK HAVING A GOOD AMOUNT OF RICE TONIGHT
810,00:30:47.29,00:30:47.29,IS BETTER THAN HAVING A BUNCH OF CANDY AND POPCORN.
811,00:30:49.12,00:30:49.12,>> YEAH.
812,00:30:50.12,00:30:50.12,>> PRETTY HOT.
813,00:30:51.50,00:30:51.50,>> REALLY HOT.
814,00:30:52.92,00:30:52.92,">> DEFINITELY THE HARDEST TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR ME,"
815,00:30:54.79,00:30:54.79,THE DECISION IS NOT GONNA BE FINAL
