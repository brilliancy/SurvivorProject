797,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,WE HAVE.
798,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,THAT MEANS SOMEONE ELSE HAS

805,00:28:26.63,00:28:26.63,AND I THINK IN FRONT OF THE JURY
806,00:28:29.20,00:28:29.20,SHE'LL SPEAK WELL.
807,00:28:29.97,00:28:29.97,SHE MIGHT BE A LOT TOUGHER TO
808,00:28:31.43,00:28:31.43,BEAT THAN RICK.
809,00:28:31.93,00:28:31.93,I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

812,00:28:36.90,00:28:36.90,CONSIDERATION.
813,00:28:37.13,00:28:37.13,AND THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD
814,00:28:38.00,00:28:38.00,ARGUMENT FOR BOTH SIDES.
815,00:28:50.67,00:28:50.67,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

834,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,NO.

847,00:30:09.60,00:30:09.60,ME TO THE UNDERSTAND.

852,00:30:17.23,00:30:17.23,BECAUSE COACH IS GOING TO GET
853,00:30:18.50,00:30:18.50,RID OF YOU NEXT.
854,00:30:20.63,00:30:20.63,IF YOU JUST FOLLOW COACH'S

865,00:30:41.10,00:30:41.10,STUFF.

869,00:30:48.33,00:30:48.33,"DIDN'T HAPPEN, OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?"
870,00:30:51.23,00:30:51.23,I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE HIS

880,00:31:10.63,00:31:10.63,MIGHT HAVE TO BE INCLINED TO
881,00:31:11.90,00:31:11.90,LISTEN TO WHAT OZZY HAS TO SAY
882,00:31:13.37,00:31:13.37,AND GET RID OF SOPHIE.

902,00:32:08.63,00:32:08.63,"Jeff: COACH, AT THE LAST"
903,00:32:10.17,00:32:10.17,TRIBAL YOU WERE VERY CLEAR IN
904,00:32:11.37,00:32:11.37,SAYING I HAVE THE HIDDEN
905,00:32:13.10,00:32:13.10,IMMUNITY IDOL.

920,00:32:32.53,00:32:32.53,I THINK THE MOST REASONABLE
921,00:32:35.20,00:32:35.20,ARGUMENT IS I'M KIND OF SOMEBODY
922,00:32:36.90,00:32:36.90,VALUABLE TO KEEP AROUND TO BE
923,00:32:38.27,00:32:38.27,ABLE TO COMPETE WITH OZZY AND

931,00:32:48.40,00:32:48.40,"YEAH, I THINK I AM."
932,00:32:50.10,00:32:50.10,I'VE WON MORE IMMUNITY
933,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,"CHALLENGES THAN RICK, ALBERT,"
934,00:32:52.83,00:32:52.83,AND COACH.
935,00:32:53.23,00:32:53.23,"Jeff: RICK, WHAT'S YOUR"
936,00:32:54.27,00:32:54.27,PITCH AS TO WHY YOU SHOULD STICK
937,00:32:55.63,00:32:55.63,AROUND TONIGHT?
938,00:32:56.13,00:32:56.13,"WELL, 90% TOMORROW, OZZY'S"
939,00:32:59.87,00:32:59.87,"GOING TO WIN IMMUNITY, MORE THAN"
940,00:33:02.10,00:33:02.10,LIKELY.
941,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,SO HE'S GOT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE
942,00:33:04.10,00:33:04.10,"THAT AREN'T GOING TO BEAT HIM,"
943,00:33:05.70,00:33:05.70,AND I HATE TO SAY THAT ABOUT
944,00:33:07.10,00:33:07.10,MYSELF BUT I HAVEN'T WON ANY
945,00:33:08.53,00:33:08.53,IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.
946,00:33:09.33,00:33:09.33,SO THAT'S ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT.
947,00:33:10.90,00:33:10.90,"Jeff: SOPHIE, HOW DO YOU"
948,00:33:13.50,00:33:13.50,COUNTER RICK'S ARGUMENT THAT HE
949,00:33:14.70,00:33:14.70,"MAKES TO OZZY WHICH IS, VOTE"
950,00:33:16.47,00:33:16.47,WITH ME BECAUSE YOU WILL BEAT
951,00:33:17.73,00:33:17.73,ME?
952,00:33:18.13,00:33:18.13,I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
953,00:33:18.83,00:33:18.83,STEP RIGHT NOW IS TO GET RID OF
954,00:33:20.80,00:33:20.80,"OZZY, AND IF RICK'S NOT THE MAN"
955,00:33:22.53,00:33:22.53,"TO DO IT, THERE'S NO POINT IN"
956,00:33:24.53,00:33:24.53,HAVING HIM AROUND NEXT TIME.
957,00:33:26.33,00:33:26.33,"Jeff: COACH, WHY IS IT YOU"
958,00:33:27.93,00:33:27.93,DON'T WANT OZZY TO MOVE ON AND
959,00:33:29.53,00:33:29.53,NOT SOMEONE ELSE OUT OF THIS
960,00:33:31.00,00:33:31.00,GROUP?
961,00:33:31.37,00:33:31.37,"YOU KNOW, I THINK IT COMES"
962,00:33:32.27,00:33:32.27,BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING WHERE
963,00:33:34.10,00:33:34.10,WE MADE A BOND WITH EACH OTHER.
964,00:33:36.00,00:33:36.00,"AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE MERGE,"
965,00:33:37.50,00:33:37.50,YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS AND TRY
966,00:33:39.10,00:33:39.10,TO FEEL OUT WHAT THE BEST
967,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,DIRECTION FOR THE GAME IS.
968,00:33:42.87,00:33:42.87,AND GUESS WHAT?
969,00:33:43.60,00:33:43.60,"AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE"
970,00:33:44.57,00:33:44.57,STILL A FAMILY.
971,00:33:45.40,00:33:45.40,AND I STILL THINK THIS IS
972,00:33:47.77,00:33:47.77,FAMILY.
973,00:33:48.13,00:33:48.13,AND TAKE THAT VERY SPECIAL.
974,00:33:50.83,00:33:50.83,"WELL, WE TALKED."
975,00:33:52.33,00:33:52.33,"I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO-- IF YOU"
976,00:33:53.93,00:33:53.93,"WANT TO AIR IT OUT, COACH."
977,00:33:55.30,00:33:55.30,YOU SAID-- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
978,00:33:56.93,00:33:56.93,TO TAKE ME TO THE END.
979,00:33:59.13,00:33:59.13,RIGHT?
980,00:33:59.30,00:33:59.30,"ABSOLUTELY, MAN."
981,00:34:00.70,00:34:00.70,AIR IT OUT.
982,00:34:01.33,00:34:01.33,I DON'T CARE.
983,00:34:01.93,00:34:01.93,"LOOK, YOU SAID WE HAVE A GOOD"
984,00:34:05.57,00:34:05.57,SHOT AT MAKING A GO AT THE END
985,00:34:07.33,00:34:07.33,OF THIS GAME.
986,00:34:07.80,00:34:07.80,"FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK"
987,00:34:08.90,00:34:08.90,IT MATTERS NOW WHO IS A LOYAL
988,00:34:10.40,00:34:10.40,"PERSON, WHO IS NOT."
989,00:34:11.77,00:34:11.77,BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S NOT JUST OLD
990,00:34:13.83,00:34:13.83,LOYALTIES THAT MAKES MEANTIME
991,00:34:17.10,00:34:17.10,OZZY OUT OF THE GAME.
992,00:34:19.23,00:34:19.23,OZZY HASN'T RESPECTED ME SINCE
993,00:34:21.10,00:34:21.10,DAY ONE.
994,00:34:21.60,00:34:21.60,THAT'S BULL.
995,00:34:22.20,00:34:22.20,WHEN YOU DON'T TALK MORE THAN
996,00:34:24.23,00:34:24.23,"ONE SENTENCE TO ME, THAT'S"
997,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,DISRESPECTFUL.
998,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,I THINK YOU ACT LIKE A
999,00:34:28.20,00:34:28.20,SPOILED BRAT.
1000,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,HOW?
1001,00:34:29.23,00:34:29.23,EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION
1002,00:34:30.83,00:34:30.83,I'M MAKE MY JUDGMENT OFF OF IS
1003,00:34:33.83,00:34:33.83,FROM PEOPLE WHO COME THROUGH
1004,00:34:35.53,00:34:35.53,REDEMPTION AND PEOPLE SAY ALL
1005,00:34:37.23,00:34:37.23,SOPHIE DOES IS SLEEP AND NOTHING
1006,00:34:39.23,00:34:39.23,ELSE.
1007,00:34:39.57,00:34:39.57,ALL SHE DOES IT HANG OUT.
1008,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77,JUST BEING HONEST.
1009,00:34:41.37,00:34:41.37,"JUST TO MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR, I"
1010,00:34:43.20,00:34:43.20,DID LIKE YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF
1011,00:34:44.57,00:34:44.57,"THIS GAME, AND THEN YOU HEAR"
1012,00:34:46.13,00:34:46.13,OZZY IS SUCH AN ARROGANT
1013,00:34:48.13,00:34:48.13,( BLEEP ).
1014,00:34:48.47,00:34:48.47,I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SAY
1015,00:34:50.10,00:34:50.10,THAT.
1016,00:34:50.27,00:34:50.27,FINE.
1017,00:34:50.67,00:34:50.67,BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
1018,00:34:51.87,00:34:51.87,IT'S THE SAME THING.
1019,00:34:52.73,00:34:52.73,YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
1020,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,WHATEVER.
1021,00:34:56.30,00:34:56.30,"Jeff: SOPHIE, I'M UNCLEAR"
1022,00:34:58.23,00:34:58.23,ON WHY YOU'RE FRUSTRATED THAT
1023,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,OZZY IS SAYING SOMETHING BEHIND
1024,00:35:01.30,00:35:01.30,YOUR BACK ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER
1025,00:35:02.90,00:35:02.90,WHEN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DID THE
1026,00:35:04.27,00:35:04.27,SAME THING AS WELL.
1027,00:35:06.80,00:35:06.80,I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS A
1028,00:35:08.83,00:35:08.83,"VERY, LIKE, PERSONAL ATTACK JUST"
1029,00:35:10.10,00:35:10.10,FROM OZZY.
1030,00:35:11.43,00:35:11.43,AND SO TO HEAR THAT I'VE BEEN
1031,00:35:13.40,00:35:13.40,"SINGLED OUT AS THIS BRAT, IT WAS"
1032,00:35:15.47,00:35:15.47,HURTFUL.
1033,00:35:15.77,00:35:15.77,IT WAS REALLY HURTFUL.
1034,00:35:18.60,00:35:18.60,Jeff: ARE THERE OTHER TIMES
1035,00:35:21.97,00:35:21.97,IN LIFE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF
1036,00:35:23.13,00:35:23.13,IN SITUATION WHERE'S PEOPLE ARE
1037,00:35:24.53,00:35:24.53,COMMENTING ON YOUR CHARACTER OR
1038,00:35:25.47,00:35:25.47,IS THIS UNIQUE?
1039,00:35:26.97,00:35:26.97,"NO, THIS IS UNIQUE."
1040,00:35:28.10,00:35:28.10,Jeff: SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS
1041,00:35:29.50,00:35:29.50,SO PERSONAL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
1042,00:35:30.37,00:35:30.37,USED TO IT AND YOU'RE FEELING
1043,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,LIKE IT IS AN ATTACK ON CUR
1044,00:35:35.47,00:35:35.47,CHARACTER FROM SOMEBODY WHO
1045,00:35:37.10,00:35:37.10,DOESN'T KNOW YOU.
1046,00:35:37.83,00:35:37.83,ALTHOUGH THERE IS A GAME AND
1047,00:35:39.37,00:35:39.37,YOU HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC AND YOU
1048,00:35:41.10,00:35:41.10,"HAVE TO LIE, THERE ARE WAYS TO"
1049,00:35:42.90,00:35:42.90,KEEP YOUR CHARACTER INTACT.
1050,00:35:44.37,00:35:44.37,AND I FELT LIKE I'VE DONE THAT
1051,00:35:45.73,00:35:45.73,"THIS WHOLE GAME, AND I FELT LIKE"
1052,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,I HAVEN'T MADE PERSONAL ATTACKS
1053,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,AGAINST PEOPLE.
1054,00:35:49.10,00:35:49.10,I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING UNNECESSARY
1055,00:35:51.47,00:35:51.47,TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND I
1056,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,FELT LIKE I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
1057,00:35:54.20,00:35:54.20,PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
1058,00:35:55.30,00:35:55.30,SO WHEN SUDDENLY AFTER FEELING
1059,00:35:56.67,00:35:56.67,LIKE I'VE KEPT MY CHARACTER
1060,00:35:58.37,00:35:58.37,INTACT WHEN IT IS SUDDENLY
1061,00:35:59.80,00:35:59.80,"CALLED INTO QUESTION, AND EVEN"
1062,00:36:01.00,00:36:01.00,NOW WHEN HE'S SAYING IT'S
1063,00:36:03.10,00:36:03.10,"EVERYBODY CALLING INTO QUESTION,"
1064,00:36:04.13,00:36:04.13,IT DOES HURT.
1065,00:36:11.23,00:36:11.23,Jeff: DO YOU SEE THIS AS
1066,00:36:13.00,00:36:13.00,ANY KIND OF AN OPPORTUNITY
1067,00:36:15.20,00:36:15.20,SHOULD YOU SURVIVE TONIGHT'S
1068,00:36:16.67,00:36:16.67,VOTE OF THICKENING THE SKIN?

1545,00:53:16.40,00:53:16.40,YOU GOT IT GOING.
1546,00:53:17.27,00:53:17.27,THE ONLY THING THAT WAS HARD WAS
1547,00:53:18.47,00:53:18.47,THE FIRST PIECE.
1548,00:53:19.57,00:53:19.57,JUST GOT BACK FROM THE FINAL
1549,00:53:20.83,00:53:20.83,CHALLENGE AND I LOST.
1550,00:53:23.90,00:53:23.90,OF COURSE STUPID PUZZLE.
1551,00:53:25.90,00:53:25.90,MY MIND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND I
1552,00:53:27.37,00:53:27.37,COULDN'T DO IT.
1553,00:53:28.47,00:53:28.47,"EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE, I'VE"
1554,00:53:30.77,00:53:30.77,"PUT INTO THIS GAME, JUST CAME"

1557,00:53:35.13,00:53:35.13,I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING.

1561,00:53:41.43,00:53:41.43,GOING TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
1562,00:53:42.67,00:53:42.67,I DON'T KNOW.
1563,00:53:45.17,00:53:45.17,BUT--
1564,00:53:45.43,00:53:45.43,WHOO!

1571,00:53:59.50,00:53:59.50,A NEW SLAYER IS BORN.
1572,00:54:01.10,00:54:01.10,"SOPHIE, YOU CERTAINLY ARE"
1573,00:54:03.03,00:54:03.03,"BECAUSE IN THIS GAME, FROM"
1574,00:54:05.00,00:54:05.00,"MOMENT ONE, OZZY WAS THE CRAGON."
1575,00:54:08.33,00:54:08.33,AND YOU SLAYED HIM.
1576,00:54:09.60,00:54:09.60,EVERYTHING WAS RIDING ON THIS
1577,00:54:11.30,00:54:11.30,CHALLENGE.
1578,00:54:11.60,00:54:11.60,BEATING OZZY WAS CRUCIAL.
1579,00:54:13.13,00:54:13.13,OZZY HAD TO BE OUT OF THIS GAME.
1580,00:54:14.60,00:54:14.60,"AND I THINK BEYOND THAT, BEING"
1581,00:54:16.10,00:54:16.10,"THE ONE TO BEAT OZZY, MUST BE"
1582,00:54:18.70,00:54:18.70,SOMETHING I CAN HANG MY HAT ON
1583,00:54:20.60,00:54:20.60,COME FINAL TRIBAL.
1584,00:54:21.47,00:54:21.47,HE'S BEEN THE TANGIBLE
1585,00:54:23.57,00:54:23.57,VILLAIN.
1586,00:54:23.97,00:54:23.97,HE LITERALLY IS THE BAD GUY.
1587,00:54:26.10,00:54:26.10,AND WE GOT TO FREAKING KNOCK HIM
1588,00:54:27.90,00:54:27.90,OUT ON THE LAST DAY.
1589,00:54:29.83,00:54:29.83,DON'T TALK OZZY FOR TOO LONG.
1590,00:54:31.70,00:54:31.70,I DON'T WANT TO BE HAMMING IT UP
1591,00:54:32.70,00:54:32.70,WITH HIM AND CAUSE DISSENSION
1592,00:54:34.27,00:54:34.27,AMONG US.
1593,00:54:34.70,00:54:34.70,YEAH.
1594,00:54:35.13,00:54:35.13,SO I'M JUST GOING TO TALK TO
1595,00:54:36.63,00:54:36.63,HIM JUST FAIR SECOND.
1596,00:54:37.43,00:54:37.43,NOBODY CAN BE AS CONFIDENT AS
1597,00:54:38.53,00:54:38.53,I AM RIGHT NOW.
1598,00:54:39.43,00:54:39.43,I HAVE THE NECKLACE AROUND MY
1599,00:54:41.07,00:54:41.07,"NECK, BUT TONIGHT IS NOT A LOCK"
1600,00:54:42.83,00:54:42.83,FOR ALBERT AND COACH.
1601,00:54:44.43,00:54:44.43,THERE COULD BE A 2-2 TIE
1602,00:54:46.73,00:54:46.73,TONIGHT.
1603,00:54:47.17,00:54:47.17,I THINK ALBERT WILL DEFINITELY
1604,00:54:48.37,00:54:48.37,VOTE FOR OZZY.
1605,00:54:49.27,00:54:49.27,I'LL DEFINITELY VOTE FOR OZZY.
1606,00:54:50.63,00:54:50.63,BUT COACH'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
1607,00:54:52.23,00:54:52.23,OZZY HAS BEEN A BIT BEHIND
1608,00:54:53.63,00:54:53.63,CLOSED DOORS.
1609,00:54:54.47,00:54:54.47,HE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH
1610,00:54:56.40,00:54:56.40,"HIM AT REDEMPTION, AT THE MERGE,"
1611,00:54:57.97,00:54:57.97,THIS MORNING.
1612,00:54:59.63,00:54:59.63,COACH COULD BE PLAYING A GAME
1613,00:55:00.90,00:55:00.90,ALBERT AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
1614,00:55:02.27,00:55:02.27,I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE
1615,00:55:03.50,00:55:03.50,BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT I HAVE
1616,00:55:05.23,00:55:05.23,VERY LITTLE SHOT FOR THE MILLION
1617,00:55:06.33,00:55:06.33,AGAINST OZZY.
1618,00:55:08.03,00:55:08.03,HOW YOU FEELING?
1619,00:55:10.03,00:55:10.03,I'M AT PEACE.
1620,00:55:12.83,00:55:12.83,I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
1621,00:55:14.20,00:55:14.20,IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO
1622,00:55:15.57,00:55:15.57,REALLY IS THE MOST DESERVING
1623,00:55:16.77,00:55:16.77,"PERSON, AND I KNOW YOU GOT A"
1624,00:55:18.50,00:55:18.50,"LITTLE FLARE FOR THE DRAMATIC,"
1625,00:55:19.73,00:55:19.73,THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK IS
1626,00:55:21.43,00:55:21.43,JUST TO GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO
1627,00:55:22.73,00:55:22.73,FIGHT ONE MORE BATTLE TO MAKE A
1628,00:55:25.83,00:55:25.83,FIRE WITH ALBERT.
1629,00:55:26.73,00:55:26.73,THIS WOULD BE THE MOST EPIC OF
1630,00:55:29.87,00:55:29.87,EPIC WAYS.
1631,00:55:30.30,00:55:30.30,"I MEAN, LISTEN, COACH."
1632,00:55:32.27,00:55:32.27,"I KNOW, MAN, I HEAR IT."
1633,00:55:34.90,00:55:34.90,BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
1634,00:55:36.93,00:55:36.93,BATTLING AGAINST.
1635,00:55:37.30,00:55:37.30,WHAT.
1636,00:55:38.53,00:55:38.53,I'M BATTLING MY WORD.
1637,00:55:40.27,00:55:40.27,YOU ALSO GAVE ME YOUR WORD.
1638,00:55:43.07,00:55:43.07,"AFTER I YOUR WORD, I FELT"
1639,00:55:46.77,00:55:46.77,LIKE YOU BETRAYED ME.
1640,00:55:48.63,00:55:48.63,YOU FEEL LIKE ALBERT HASN'T
1641,00:55:50.93,00:55:50.93,BETRAYED YOU.
1642,00:55:51.53,00:55:51.53,I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEND
1643,00:55:52.80,00:55:52.80,TWO DAYS WITH YOU.
1644,00:55:53.63,00:55:53.63,I THINK IF SOMEBODY HAS SPENT SO
1645,00:55:55.10,00:55:55.10,MUCH TIME WITH A PERSON AND THEY
1646,00:55:56.63,00:55:56.63,"BETRAY YOU THEN, AS OPPOSED TO"
1647,00:55:58.37,00:55:58.37,SOMEONE THAT YOU'VE JUST MET
1648,00:56:02.13,00:56:02.13,THAT HAS NEVER SEEN WHAT YOU
1649,00:56:03.47,00:56:03.47,"ARE, WHAT YOU STAND FOR."
1650,00:56:04.33,00:56:04.33,THE REAL TEST OF WHO IS
1651,00:56:06.43,00:56:06.43,DESERVING TO GO AND SIT NEXT TO
1652,00:56:09.23,00:56:09.23,YOU IS THIS OPPORTUNITY.
1653,00:56:11.03,00:56:11.03,I HAVE SAID FROM THE
1654,00:56:12.73,00:56:12.73,BEGINNING OF DAY ONE THAT I WANT
1655,00:56:15.10,00:56:15.10,TO TAKE THE BEST TO THE END.
1656,00:56:16.53,00:56:16.53,I WANT TO TAKE THE STRONGEST TO
1657,00:56:18.23,00:56:18.23,THE END.
1658,00:56:18.67,00:56:18.67,I WANT TO TAKE THE WARRIORS TO
1659,00:56:21.37,00:56:21.37,THE END.
1660,00:56:21.97,00:56:21.97,"AND OZZY, IN EVERY SENSE OF THE"
1661,00:56:24.17,00:56:24.17,"WORD, IS A WARRIOR."
1662,00:56:26.87,00:56:26.87,"ALBEIT ARROGANT, BUT HE IS A"
1663,00:56:29.77,00:56:29.77,WARRIOR.
1664,00:56:30.17,00:56:30.17,IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS BE
1665,00:56:31.70,00:56:31.70,THE REAL WARRIOR BATTLE THAT YOU
1666,00:56:33.33,00:56:33.33,"SAY YOU WANT TO HAVE, THAT WE"
1667,00:56:34.83,00:56:34.83,"BOTH TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS THE"
1668,00:56:35.70,00:56:35.70,WAY TO DO IT.
1669,00:56:36.47,00:56:36.47,IT REALLY IS.
1670,00:56:36.90,00:56:36.90,I UNDERSTAND THAT.
1671,00:56:38.50,00:56:38.50,IT'S ALSO A WORD OF A
1672,00:56:40.37,00:56:40.37,CHRISTIAN MAN THAT YOU GAVE TO
1673,00:56:42.00,00:56:42.00,ME.
1674,00:56:42.33,00:56:42.33,THIS IS WHERE IT'S REAL.
1675,00:56:43.83,00:56:43.83,RIGHT NOW.
1676,00:56:45.97,00:56:45.97,I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE THE RIGHT
1677,00:56:47.23,00:56:47.23,"DECISION, MAN."
1678,00:56:47.83,00:56:47.83,"THE DILEMMA THAT I HAVE NOW,"
1679,00:56:49.97,00:56:49.97,WHY ISN'T THERE AN EASY VOTE AT
1680,00:56:51.37,00:56:51.37,THIS TIME?
1681,00:56:52.00,00:56:52.00,"WHY CAN'T I SAY TO MYSELF, COOL,"
1682,00:56:54.33,00:56:54.33,MAN.
1683,00:56:54.80,00:56:54.80,IT'S THE ENEMY THAT WE'VE BEEN
1684,00:56:55.80,00:56:55.80,FIGHTING AGAINST ALL ALONG.
1685,00:56:58.00,00:56:58.00,IT'S OZZY.
1686,00:56:59.17,00:56:59.17,WHY CAN'T IT BE EASY?
1687,00:57:01.20,00:57:01.20,"BUT IT'S STILL, ON DAY 38, RACKS"
1688,00:57:04.10,00:57:04.10,MY BRAIN BECAUSE I'M SITTING
1689,00:57:06.97,00:57:06.97,HERE WITH ANOTHER ANGUISHING
1690,00:57:09.37,00:57:09.37,DECISION.
1691,00:57:10.37,00:57:10.37,ANOTHER DECISION THAT'S GOING TO
1692,00:57:11.23,00:57:11.23,RIP MY HEART OUT.
1693,00:57:38.67,00:57:38.67,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1740,00:58:54.67,00:58:54.67,SO CLOSE YET AGAIN I FALL SHORT?
1741,00:58:57.27,00:58:57.27,I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

1743,00:59:00.27,00:59:00.27,TIME WHEN YOU THINK THIS MIGHT

1745,00:59:02.07,00:59:02.07,AND IT'S PRETTY DEVASTATING.
1746,00:59:03.47,00:59:03.47,AND FROM A COMPETITOR LIKE OZZY
1747,00:59:05.90,00:59:05.90,WHO IS SO DESERVING TO BE ANY
1748,00:59:09.07,00:59:09.07,"PLACE IN THE THIS GAME, THE"

1753,00:59:17.07,00:59:17.07,SPEND THE AFTERNOON?
1754,00:59:17.53,00:59:17.53,"WELL, IT'S NO SECRET THAT"
1755,00:59:18.97,00:59:18.97,COACH AND I TALKED MULTIPLE
1756,00:59:20.30,00:59:20.30,TIMES ABOUT SITTING IN THE FINAL
1757,00:59:22.07,00:59:22.07,"TWO, IN A REAL EPIC BATTLE"

1759,00:59:26.10,00:59:26.10,SURVIVORS.
1760,00:59:26.77,00:59:26.77,AND IF COACH IS A MAN OF HIS
1761,00:59:29.33,00:59:29.33,"WORD, HE'LL LIVE UP TO THAT"
1762,00:59:30.57,00:59:30.57,PROMISE.
1763,00:59:31.00,00:59:31.00,SO I KNOW COACH IS GOING THROUGH
1764,00:59:32.60,00:59:32.60,THIS SORT OF MENTAL PROCESS.
1765,00:59:35.03,00:59:35.03,BUT I THINK THERE'S A REALLY
1766,00:59:36.53,00:59:36.53,EASY WAY TO FIND OUT WHO
1767,00:59:38.03,00:59:38.03,DESERVES IT.
1768,00:59:38.63,00:59:38.63,COACH KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING
1769,00:59:40.43,00:59:40.43,ABOUT.
1770,00:59:40.73,00:59:40.73,Jeff: WHOSE HE TALKING
1771,00:59:41.37,00:59:41.37,ABOUT COACH?
1772,00:59:42.03,00:59:42.03,TALKING ABOUT TYING UP THE
1773,00:59:43.43,00:59:43.43,VOTE SO THERE'S A FIRE-MAKING
1774,00:59:45.87,00:59:45.87,CHALLENGE.
1775,00:59:46.10,00:59:46.10,"Jeff: JUST SO I'M CLEAR,"
1776,00:59:47.40,00:59:47.40,OZZY IS SAYING GIVE ME A SHOT.
1777,00:59:49.00,00:59:49.00,LET ME GO UP AGAINST ALBERT.
1778,00:59:50.87,00:59:50.87,WHOEVER CAN MAKE FIRE MOVES ON.
1779,00:59:53.23,00:59:53.23,RIGHT.
1780,00:59:53.60,00:59:53.60,Jeff: IS THAT HARD FOR YOU
1781,00:59:54.53,00:59:54.53,BECAUSE THE ONE CONSISTENT IN
1782,00:59:56.53,00:59:56.53,ALL THREE TIMES THAT YOU'VE
1783,00:59:58.00,00:59:58.00,PLAYED HAS BEEN I ACTUALLY WANT
1784,01:00:00.00,01:00:00.00,TO TRY TO PLAY A GAME WITH
1785,01:00:02.30,01:00:02.30,HONOR.
1786,01:00:02.70,01:00:02.70,"YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS GAME"
1787,01:00:03.60,01:00:03.60,"IS VERY HARD, ESPECIALLY IF YOU"
1788,01:00:04.63,01:00:04.63,START OUT THIS GAME AND YOU SAY
1789,01:00:05.70,01:00:05.70,I WANT TO PLAY IT HONORABLY.
1790,01:00:07.57,01:00:07.57,"AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID, YOU KNOW,"
1791,01:00:08.67,01:00:08.67,THAT I WANT TO TAKE THE
1792,01:00:10.03,01:00:10.03,STRONGEST PEOPLE TO THE END.
1793,01:00:11.40,01:00:11.40,BUT I THINK THAT THESE TWO HERE
1794,01:00:13.10,01:00:13.10,ARE ALSO VERY STRONG.
1795,01:00:14.63,01:00:14.63,THE ONLY THING THAT SETS OZZY
1796,01:00:16.63,01:00:16.63,APART IS THAT HE CAME BACK AND
1797,01:00:18.23,01:00:18.23,COMING BACK IS AN ALMOST
1798,01:00:19.77,01:00:19.77,IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO GET TO THE
1799,01:00:21.20,01:00:21.20,END.
1800,01:00:21.60,01:00:21.60,AND SO THAT'S THE DILEMMA.
1801,01:00:24.87,01:00:24.87,Jeff: ALBERT HOW DO YOU
1802,01:00:26.07,01:00:26.07,THINK YOU WOULD DO IN A FIRE
1803,01:00:27.67,01:00:27.67,MAKING CHALLENGE AGAINST OZZY
1804,01:00:29.00,01:00:29.00,JAI KNOW HOW TO MAKE FIRE.
1805,01:00:30.70,01:00:30.70,BUT IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW
1806,01:00:32.17,01:00:32.17,HOW TO DRIVE.
1807,01:00:33.00,01:00:33.00,BUT ARE YOU GOING TO BEAT JEFF

1810,01:00:38.27,01:00:38.27,SPEAKING VERY CANDIDLY WITH IT.
1811,01:00:40.17,01:00:40.17,Jeff: HEARING OZZY BROACH
1812,01:00:41.57,01:00:41.57,THIS TOPIC WITH COACH HAS GOT TO
1813,01:00:42.80,01:00:42.80,BE A LITTLE UNSETTLING.
1814,01:00:44.63,01:00:44.63,IT'S SOMETHING THEY JUST HAVE
1815,01:00:45.77,01:00:45.77,TO KEEP MY TRUST IN COACH THAT
1816,01:00:46.93,01:00:46.93,HE IS THE PERSON THAT I'VE SEEN
1817,01:00:48.37,01:00:48.37,HIM BE TO ME.
1818,01:00:49.23,01:00:49.23,I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT
1819,01:00:51.43,01:00:51.43,HE'S DONE THAT WOULD INDICATE HE
1820,01:00:53.13,01:00:53.13,MIGHT TURN HIS BACK ON ME AT
1821,01:00:55.23,01:00:55.23,THIS POINT BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
1822,01:00:58.13,01:00:58.13,"Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SOPHIE HAS"
1823,01:01:00.50,01:01:00.50,"INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, YOU CANNOT"

1955,01:06:00.97,01:06:00.97,ALBERT REALLY GOT LUCKY.
1956,01:06:02.40,01:06:02.40,I THINK THAT HE PLAYED A SPOILER

1958,01:06:05.07,01:06:05.07,HE WAS REALLY OUT FOR HIMSELF
1959,01:06:06.50,01:06:06.50,AND PANDERING TO THE JURY WAY
1960,01:06:08.17,01:06:08.17,TOO QUICKLY.
1961,01:06:09.27,01:06:09.27,AND HE'S LUCKY TO BE HERE.

1963,01:06:13.53,01:06:13.53,LOW TO HANDLE ALBERT.

1965,01:06:17.67,01:06:17.67,TRIBAL COUNCIL TO BEING A BIT
1966,01:06:19.70,01:06:19.70,"SQUIRRELLY, A BILL BIT WORMER."

1980,01:06:38.90,01:06:38.90,EMOTIONAL CRYING BECAUSE I THINK
1981,01:06:39.83,01:06:39.83,THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T
1982,01:06:41.27,01:06:41.27,DESERVE TO GO TO THE END.

1984,01:06:45.27,01:06:45.27,PERHAPS A BIT MORE LOGICALLY
1985,01:06:48.30,01:06:48.30,THAN EMOTIONALLY.
1986,01:06:52.00,01:06:52.00,"SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHAMP?"
1987,01:06:53.83,01:06:53.83,WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

2113,01:10:48.93,01:10:48.93,"Jeff: SOPHIE, YOU'RE UP."
2114,01:10:50.07,01:10:50.07,"OKAY, SO I'M JUST GOING TO"
2115,01:10:51.70,01:10:51.70,CUT TO THE CHASE.
2116,01:10:53.77,01:10:53.77,"IT'S ABOUT OUTWIT, OUTLASTING,"
2117,01:10:56.33,01:10:56.33,AND OUTPLAYING.
2118,01:10:57.47,01:10:57.47,AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUTPLAYING
2119,01:10:58.80,01:10:58.80,I FELT LIKE I HELD MY OWN IN THE
2120,01:11:00.60,01:11:00.60,CHALLENGES.
2121,01:11:00.83,01:11:00.83,WHEN IT CAME TO INDIVIDUAL
2122,01:11:02.60,01:11:02.60,"IMMUNITIES, I WON THREE"
2123,01:11:04.20,01:11:04.20,INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITYS.
2124,01:11:04.70,01:11:04.70,"WHEN IT CAME TO OUTWITTING, I"
2125,01:11:06.43,01:11:06.43,FELT THERE WERE TWO PARTS.
2126,01:11:07.43,01:11:07.43,ONE WAS THE STRATEGIC PART AND I
2127,01:11:09.43,01:11:09.43,FELT I DID THAT WELL.
2128,01:11:10.40,01:11:10.40,I MADE A FIVE-PERSON ALLIANCE
2129,01:11:11.73,01:11:11.73,FROM THE BEGINNING AND I WANTED
2130,01:11:12.43,01:11:12.43,TO KEEP THAT FIVE-PERSON
2131,01:11:13.63,01:11:13.63,ALLIANCE TO THE END.
2132,01:11:14.53,01:11:14.53,IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE
2133,01:11:15.67,01:11:15.67,"EASIEST THING TO DO, BUT I MADE"
2134,01:11:17.10,01:11:17.10,SURE THAT MY STRATEGY REVOLVED
2135,01:11:19.13,01:11:19.13,AROUND IT.
2136,01:11:19.73,01:11:19.73,AND THEN THE OTHER HALF OF THAT
2137,01:11:22.17,01:11:22.17,OUTWITTING I THINK WAS A SOCIAL
2138,01:11:23.03,01:11:23.03,"GAME, AND I THINK IT BECAME MORE"
2139,01:11:24.47,01:11:24.47,CLEAR TO ME A COUPLE OF TRIBALS
2140,01:11:26.67,01:11:26.67,AGO MAYBE I WASN'T SO GOOD AT
2141,01:11:28.03,01:11:28.03,THE SOCIAL GAME.
2142,01:11:28.63,01:11:28.63,I FELT LIKE I MADE SOME GENUINE
2143,01:11:30.43,01:11:30.43,FRIENDSHIPS BACK AT UPOLU.
2144,01:11:33.30,01:11:33.30,I'M NOT A USED CAR SALESMAN.
2145,01:11:35.10,01:11:35.10,I CAME OUT HERE AND I WAS
2146,01:11:37.03,01:11:37.03,MYSELF.
2147,01:11:37.43,01:11:37.43,I DO THINK I WAS AS HONEST AS
2148,01:11:39.93,01:11:39.93,POSSIBLE.
2149,01:11:40.27,01:11:40.27,SO I THINK I FULFILLED THE
2150,01:11:44.57,01:11:44.57,REQUIREMENTS.
2151,01:11:44.77,01:11:44.77,Jeff: COACH.
2152,01:11:45.07,01:11:45.07,"I JUST HAVE TO SAY, WOW."
2153,01:11:46.30,01:11:46.30,I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE I'M UP
2154,01:11:47.80,01:11:47.80,HERE.
2155,01:11:48.23,01:11:48.23,WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING
2156,01:11:48.77,01:11:48.77,"OF THIS GAME, REDEMPTION ISLAND"
2157,01:11:50.17,01:11:50.17,"IS BUILT FOR SOMEBODY LIKE OZZY,"
2158,01:11:51.63,01:11:51.63,"YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S GREAT IN"
2159,01:11:54.00,01:11:54.00,"CHALLENGES, AND, YOU KNOW, COACH"
2160,01:11:55.10,01:11:55.10,IS A BIT OF A CHARACTER.
2161,01:11:56.30,01:11:56.30,I HAD AN UPHILL BATTLE COMING
2162,01:11:58.33,01:11:58.33,"INTO THIS GAME, AND THE FIRST"
2163,01:11:59.33,01:11:59.33,TIME I PLAYED THIS GAME I PLAYED
2164,01:12:01.27,01:12:01.27,WITH ARROGANCE AND
2165,01:12:03.33,01:12:03.33,"SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND I TRIED"
2166,01:12:04.23,01:12:04.23,TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS
2167,01:12:05.37,01:12:05.37,GAME AND THAT IS I TRIED TO LEAD
2168,01:12:07.13,01:12:07.13,"WITH COMPASSION, LOVE,"
2169,01:12:08.47,01:12:08.47,APPRECIATION AND RESPECT.
2170,01:12:09.50,01:12:09.50,AND I DON'T THINK A LOT OF
2171,01:12:11.03,01:12:11.03,LEADERS DO THAT.
2172,01:12:12.03,01:12:12.03,BEST THING ABOUT THIS JOURNEY IS
2173,01:12:13.67,01:12:13.67,INSTEAD OF FITTING EVERYBODY TO
2174,01:12:15.17,01:12:15.17,"MY JOURNEY AND MY PLANS, I JUST"
2175,01:12:16.43,01:12:16.43,LOOKED AT EVERYBODY THAT WAS
2176,01:12:17.13,01:12:17.13,AROUND ME.
2177,01:12:18.07,01:12:18.07,"AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT?"
2178,01:12:19.33,01:12:19.33,WHEN YOU OPEN UP YOURSELF TO
2179,01:12:21.00,01:12:21.00,"OTHERS, YOU RECEIVE IT 10FOLD"
2180,01:12:22.93,01:12:22.93,AND I'M TRULY BLESSED TO HAVE
2181,01:12:24.67,01:12:24.67,GOTTEN A PIECE OF EACH AND EVERY
2182,01:12:26.57,01:12:26.57,ONE OF YOU THROUGH THIS GAME.

2205,01:13:10.50,01:13:10.50,VOTE FOR ANY OF YOU GUYS.
2206,01:13:13.47,01:13:13.47,"SOPHIE, I STILL THINK AS A"
2207,01:13:17.80,01:13:17.80,"PRIVILEGED, PRETENTIOUS BRAT."
2208,01:13:18.40,01:13:18.40,"I STILL DO, IN MY OPINION."
2209,01:13:20.17,01:13:20.17,"LUCKILY, SOPHIE, YOU CAN CHANGE."

2213,01:13:29.57,01:13:29.57,AND REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
2214,01:13:30.87,01:13:30.87,TOO AMAZING IN MY OPINION.
2215,01:13:31.97,01:13:31.97,"SO, COACH, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU"
2216,01:13:33.60,01:13:33.60,CREDIT AS A VETERAN GETTING TO
2217,01:13:35.17,01:13:35.17,THE END.
2218,01:13:36.10,01:13:36.10,"IT'S HUGE, AND I'M GIVING YOU"
2219,01:13:37.47,01:13:37.47,THE CHANCE ALONE TO WIN THIS
2220,01:13:39.17,01:13:39.17,GAME OR TO LOSE THIS GAME.
2221,01:13:41.10,01:13:41.10,BUT THAT'S BASED ON WHAT YOU
2222,01:13:42.30,01:13:42.30,GIVE ME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU
2223,01:13:44.27,01:13:44.27,GOT TO BE HONEST.
2224,01:13:45.77,01:13:45.77,YOUR GAME PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN A
2225,01:13:47.33,01:13:47.33,CERTAIN THING.
2226,01:13:48.67,01:13:48.67,"THE HONOR, ALL OF THAT."
2227,01:13:50.37,01:13:50.37,WE ALL KNOW IT'S A BUNCH OF
2228,01:13:51.83,01:13:51.83,"BULL, BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY"
2229,01:13:52.70,01:13:52.70,"BELIEVE THAT, IT WOULD BE ME AND"
2230,01:13:54.13,01:13:54.13,YOU SITTING UP THERE.
2231,01:13:55.37,01:13:55.37,IT WOULD BE.
2232,01:13:55.97,01:13:55.97,ABSOLUTELY.
2233,01:13:56.40,01:13:56.40,SO DID YOU PLAY THE WAY YOU
2234,01:13:58.03,01:13:58.03,SAY OR DID YOU NOT?
2235,01:13:59.03,01:13:59.03,I TRIED TO PLAY THIS GAME
2236,01:14:00.57,01:14:00.57,WITH HONOR.
2237,01:14:01.57,01:14:01.57,AND I CAME TO ALL THESE
2238,01:14:05.13,01:14:05.13,CROSSROADS IN THE GAME WHERE I
2239,01:14:06.20,01:14:06.20,"HAD TO COMPROMISE MY WORD, AND I"
2240,01:14:09.10,01:14:09.10,FOUND MYSELF BREAKING MY WORD.
2241,01:14:10.80,01:14:10.80,AND IT HURT ME.
2242,01:14:11.80,01:14:11.80,I KNEW THAT IT HURT OTHER
2243,01:14:13.33,01:14:13.33,PEOPLE.
2244,01:14:13.70,01:14:13.70,I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF LIKE
2245,01:14:14.90,01:14:14.90,"YOU, THIS IS MY THIRD AND FINAL"
2246,01:14:16.67,01:14:16.67,TIME.
2247,01:14:17.10,01:14:17.10,AND I WANT TO GET TO THE END.
2248,01:14:18.03,01:14:18.03,AND I WANT TO WIN THE MILLION
2249,01:14:20.03,01:14:20.03,DOLLARS.
2250,01:14:22.50,01:14:22.50,SO I THINK I PLAYED THIS GAME
2251,01:14:23.77,01:14:23.77,MOST OF THE TIME HONORABLY BUT
2252,01:14:25.30,01:14:25.30,THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS
2253,01:14:27.07,01:14:27.07,DEFINITELY DISHONORABLE.
2254,01:14:27.67,01:14:27.67,THAT'S IT.
2255,01:14:28.80,01:14:28.80,I GUESS I'M GOING TO UNLEASH THE
2256,01:14:30.50,01:14:30.50,DOGS ON YOU GUYS NOW.
2257,01:14:31.57,01:14:31.57,THANK YOU.
2258,01:14:33.27,01:14:33.27,"Jeff: JIM, YOU'RE UP."
2259,01:14:38.97,01:14:38.97,"ALBERT, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME"
2260,01:14:40.47,01:14:40.47,WHY THE TWO PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU
2261,01:14:42.27,01:14:42.27,SHOULDN'T BE HERE OR SHOULDN'T
2262,01:14:43.87,01:14:43.87,"WIN THE MILLION DOLLARS, AND"
2263,01:14:45.40,01:14:45.40,"SERIOUSLY, IF YOU START WITH A"
2264,01:14:48.10,01:14:48.10,"COMPLIMENT, LIKE, ""COACH IS A"
2265,01:14:49.97,01:14:49.97,"NICE GUY, BUT..."" THAT WOULD"
2266,01:14:52.00,01:14:52.00,LOSE MY VOTE.
2267,01:14:52.60,01:14:52.60,ALL RIGHT.
2268,01:14:53.03,01:14:53.03,I LOVE THIS QUESTION.
2269,01:14:54.40,01:14:54.40,I LOVE THE WAY YOU'RE
2270,01:14:55.70,01:14:55.70,APPROACHING THE GAME.
2271,01:14:57.70,01:14:57.70,SPECIFICALLY--
2272,01:14:57.93,01:14:57.93,( LAUGHTER ).
2273,01:15:00.23,01:15:00.23,NO BECAUSE VERY HONESTLY--
2274,01:15:01.40,01:15:01.40,"VERY HONESTLY, MAN, THE REASON"
2275,01:15:04.13,01:15:04.13,WHY I DON'T THINK COACH SHOULD
2276,01:15:05.40,01:15:05.40,WIN THE GAME IS I REALLY BELIEVE
2277,01:15:08.87,01:15:08.87,THE SAVAII TRIBE VIEWED COACH AS
2278,01:15:10.17,01:15:10.17,THE LEADER.
2279,01:15:10.60,01:15:10.60,"THE REALITY, COACH DIDN'T BRING"
2280,01:15:12.50,01:15:12.50,ME OR SOPHIE HERE.
2281,01:15:14.07,01:15:14.07,HE DIDN'T.
2282,01:15:14.50,01:15:14.50,WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT HIM HERE.
2283,01:15:16.20,01:15:16.20,I TOOK A STAND FOR COACH EARLY
2284,01:15:17.80,01:15:17.80,IN THIS GAME AND I GOT HIM
2285,01:15:19.67,01:15:19.67,DEEPER IN THE GAME.
2286,01:15:21.17,01:15:21.17,COACH HAD A TARGET ON HIS BACK
2287,01:15:22.43,01:15:22.43,AND HE WAS CARRIED TO THIS
2288,01:15:23.47,01:15:23.47,POINT.
2289,01:15:23.87,01:15:23.87,HE DID NOT DO THE CARRYING.
2290,01:15:25.07,01:15:25.07,"IN TERMS OF SOPHIE, SHE PLAYED A"
2291,01:15:27.37,01:15:27.37,STRONG GAME BUT DID NOT PLAY A
2292,01:15:29.23,01:15:29.23,SOCIAL GAME.
2293,01:15:31.87,01:15:31.87,I MADE TRUER CONNECTIONS WITH
2294,01:15:32.87,01:15:32.87,THIS GROUP HERE THAN SOPHIE DID
2295,01:15:35.40,01:15:35.40,OR THAN COACH DID.
2296,01:15:36.37,01:15:36.37,"I'M GOOD, THANKS, GUYS."
2297,01:15:37.90,01:15:37.90,"Jeff: THANKS, JIM."
2298,01:15:41.77,01:15:41.77,DAWN.
2299,01:15:43.50,01:15:43.50,"CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUYS."
2300,01:15:45.33,01:15:45.33,MY QUESTION IS REALLY JUST FOR
2301,01:15:46.47,01:15:46.47,"YOU, SOPHIE."
2302,01:15:47.47,01:15:47.47,I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR
2303,01:15:49.67,01:15:49.67,STRATEGY AND WHY YOU MADE THE
2304,01:15:51.13,01:15:51.13,ALLIANCE WITH COACH AND ALBERT.
2305,01:15:52.93,01:15:52.93,WHAT ABOUT THEM SPECIFICALLY
2306,01:15:54.03,01:15:54.03,EARLY ON?
2307,01:15:54.43,01:15:54.43,BEFORE I CAME TO THIS GAME I
2308,01:15:56.13,01:15:56.13,SAID I WISH I WAS A MAN BECAUSE
2309,01:15:57.70,01:15:57.70,MEN IN THIS GAME SEEM TO BE ABLE
2310,01:15:59.97,01:15:59.97,TO GET TWO YOUNG GIRLS TO FOLLOW
2311,01:16:02.80,01:16:02.80,THEM TO THE END AND THAT'S
2312,01:16:03.77,01:16:03.77,SOMETHING I CAN'T DO.
2313,01:16:04.83,01:16:04.83,AND WHEN I MET COACH I SAW HIM
2314,01:16:06.40,01:16:06.40,AS THE EQUIVALENT OF A YOUNG
2315,01:16:08.30,01:16:08.30,GIRL.
2316,01:16:08.73,01:16:08.73,"HE WAS SOMEONE WHO SAID TO ME,"
2317,01:16:10.03,01:16:10.03,"""MY LOYALTY IS WORTH MORE THAN A"

2544,01:21:57.83,01:21:57.83,I DID THINK IT WAS A TRIBE
2545,01:21:59.70,01:21:59.70,IDOL.
2546,01:22:00.23,01:22:00.23,THE ONE TIME THEY WOULD HAVE
2547,01:22:01.33,01:22:01.33,PLAYED IT WAS AT THE 6-6 MERGE
2548,01:22:04.00,01:22:04.00,TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2560,01:22:20.37,01:22:20.37,DIDN'T NEED TO PLAY IT.
2561,01:22:21.33,01:22:21.33,I CAN CLEAR SOMETHING UP
