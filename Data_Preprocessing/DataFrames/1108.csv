40,00:01:45.12,00:01:45.12,"have my alliance with Bobby Jon,but I believe that Gary and Amy"
41,00:01:50.25,00:01:50.25,maybe deserve to be here alittle bit more than he does.
42,00:01:54.62,00:01:54.62,">> PROBST: With Bobby Jon andAmy both at risk, the tribe"
43,00:01:57.50,00:01:57.50,voted out the weaker of the two.Then the game took an unexpected

60,00:04:34.12,00:04:34.12,walk in here tonight because Ican't be around Stephanie for
61,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,more than five minutes withoutwanting to vomit.

74,00:05:12.42,00:05:12.42,>> And they don't stink.>> Yaxha came here immediately
75,00:05:17.79,00:05:17.79,after Tribal Council andbasically gave us new buffs and
76,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67,told us there was a merge.So we were all thrown for a
77,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,"loop.My head is, like, spinning."
78,00:05:26.12,00:05:26.12,">> Come on, let's get that firestarted."

81,00:05:37.42,00:05:37.42,there.>> There's not room in the
82,00:05:39.79,00:05:39.79,shelter.I hope they don't mind sleeping
83,00:05:41.21,00:05:41.21,"outside.>> He said something smart, I'm"
84,00:05:43.79,00:05:43.79,"just like, ""Dude, you goingto say one more thing to me I'm"
85,00:05:46.38,00:05:46.38,"going to knock every one of yourteeth slam out of your head."""
86,00:05:59.71,00:05:59.71,>> Ooh. Is that a log?>> Yeah.

89,00:06:13.75,00:06:13.75,>> I ain't trying to be thehero.
90,00:06:15.25,00:06:15.25,">> You gonna chill out, brother,or what?"
91,00:06:18.71,00:06:18.71,">> This morning woke up, and,you know, like I mean it wasn't"
92,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,a dream after all.We really merged and everything.
93,00:06:24.71,00:06:24.71,"And you know, a new tribe.And you think, ""Whee,"" you know,"
94,00:06:27.38,00:06:27.38,one big happy family.That's not how it works.
95,00:06:33.46,00:06:33.46,(scoffs)>> I don't think we have any
96,00:06:36.33,00:06:36.33,more wood to get.I think you're okay.
97,00:06:38.04,00:06:38.04,"Why don't you sit down?>> Nakum, we came over..."
98,00:06:45.04,00:06:45.04,I didn't think they were thatwarm and friendly.
99,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,"Brandon, Bobby Jon and myself,I think Gary does, too,"
100,00:06:49.46,00:06:49.46,"we feel kind of like we areslaves, because we know our"
101,00:06:53.17,00:06:53.17,head's on the chopping block andwe will try to do what you can
102,00:06:55.12,00:06:55.12,to stick around.But you feel like an outsider.
103,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,>> This whole deal kind ofsucks.
104,00:07:02.92,00:07:02.92,"You know, there's four of usfrom the Yaxha tribe and six of"
105,00:07:06.54,00:07:06.54,them from the Nakum tribe.>> Now we can make room on the
106,00:07:09.42,00:07:09.42,fire.Should we put it on the grill or
107,00:07:11.21,00:07:11.21,what?>> I think myself or Bobby Jon
108,00:07:14.46,00:07:14.46,are probably gonna be first onthe chopping block.
109,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,"We are probably most likely toget immunity, so they want to"
110,00:07:18.92,00:07:18.92,get those guys out first.And things aren't looking very
111,00:07:22.21,00:07:22.21,up to tell you the truth.>> I hope it's not a freakin'
112,00:07:30.33,00:07:30.33,Reward Challenge.We'll open tree mail and
113,00:07:32.62,00:07:32.62,there'll be a pig inside.>> Or a Mayan feast.
114,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,"Oh, my God.It's a basket."
115,00:07:38.67,00:07:38.67,It's a basket.What is it?
116,00:07:41.71,00:07:41.71,">> Okay, here we go.>> ""Congratulations, you are now"
117,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,one tribe.Here's your new flag and paints
118,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50,for you to add to your new tribename.
119,00:07:49.21,00:07:49.21,If you are feeling bored aroundcamp or could use some peace of
120,00:07:51.75,00:07:51.75,"mind in this game, there is asmall individual immunity idol"
121,00:07:55.25,00:07:55.25,hidden in the woods.This is in addition to any
122,00:07:59.25,00:07:59.25,individual immunity you win atchallenges.
123,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,"It is about six inches tall andis made of stone."""

127,00:08:12.54,00:08:12.54,"going to use it, you must""present it at any Tribal"
128,00:08:15.17,00:08:15.17,"Council before the vote."">> ""But the idol's powers expire"
129,00:08:17.67,00:08:17.67,"when are you down to the FinalFour."""
130,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,>> So hidden somewhere in thewoods there is an idol that will
131,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,give us immunity that we can useat any Tribal Council up to the
132,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,Final Four.Somewhere there's individual
133,00:08:32.08,00:08:32.08,immunity hidden in the woodsto use any time you want.
134,00:08:37.62,00:08:37.62,>> We got tree mail saying thatthere's a little immunity idol
135,00:08:42.83,00:08:42.83,about this big in a junglethat's this big.
136,00:08:53.21,00:08:53.21,>> So the search is on.Finding the secret immunity idol
137,00:08:57.08,00:08:57.08,"could be huge for anyone.If you use it right, you can"
138,00:09:00.62,00:09:00.62,almost guarantee yourself to theFinal Four.
139,00:09:04.42,00:09:04.42,>> You checking this area out?>> I think it's going to be
140,00:09:06.54,00:09:06.54,"someplace around the temple,don't you?"
141,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,">> If I find the idol, I am nottelling anybody."
142,00:09:10.12,00:09:10.12,"I wouldn't come prancing intocamp saying, ""Hey, I found the"
143,00:09:12.08,00:09:12.08,"idol.""No way. I wouldn't do it."
144,00:09:16.17,00:09:16.17,>> It's going to be like findinga needle in the hay stack.
145,00:09:20.21,00:09:20.21,You could be looking for daysand days and days for the damn
146,00:09:22.58,00:09:22.58,thing and still not find it.And I got a target right on my
147,00:09:25.71,00:09:25.71,"head, you know.And so I could really use it."
148,00:09:29.67,00:09:29.67,"Like, really.>> Got to find that idol, man."
149,00:10:10.00,00:10:10.00,>> Bobby Jon was looking for theidol.
150,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,"And he said, ""I'm not asking foran alliance or anything like"

156,00:10:47.75,00:10:47.75,"So, have we thought of a name?Anybody?"
157,00:10:51.71,00:10:51.71,>> What's that?>> Have we thought of a name?
158,00:10:55.79,00:10:55.79,">> What are you thinking, Cindy?>> Take the two names and blend"
159,00:10:59.50,00:10:59.50,them.>> Yeah.
160,00:11:01.88,00:11:01.88,>> Xhakum.>> I like that.
161,00:11:03.92,00:11:03.92,"That sounds catchy.Ba-ba-boom, Xhakum. Hey!"
162,00:11:08.42,00:11:08.42,>> I wanted to get our newXhakum flag started.
163,00:11:11.92,00:11:11.92,Xhakum to us means to us Yaxhaand Nakum put together.
164,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,"So we are one big happy tribe,right now."
165,00:11:20.04,00:11:20.04,"Everything is A-OK.>> Oh, it's so beautiful, you"
166,00:11:23.17,00:11:23.17,"guys.>> That looks nice, huh?"
167,00:11:25.79,00:11:25.79,>> Xhakum.Very nice.
168,00:11:28.04,00:11:28.04,Look at that.>> What's up?
169,00:11:30.62,00:11:30.62,>> The quest for the idol isstill under way.
170,00:11:33.67,00:11:33.67,"I can tell you where it isnot, back there."
171,00:11:36.67,00:11:36.67,>> It's not back there?>> Mm-mm.
172,00:11:39.04,00:11:39.04,>> Also not back there.>> That idol could be worth a
173,00:11:42.08,00:11:42.08,million dollars.I have been looking for it
174,00:11:43.92,00:11:43.92,because I don't want any of theold Yaxha to have it.
175,00:11:46.54,00:11:46.54,That would put a hurting on myplan.
176,00:11:50.17,00:11:50.17,>> I've got to take a leak.Maybe I will take a leak all
177,00:11:52.00,00:11:52.00,"over that idol.>> Me, Gary, Danni and Brandon"
178,00:11:57.50,00:11:57.50,up here are sitting ducks prettymuch.
179,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,So I spend about an hour eachday looking for the immunity
180,00:12:02.71,00:12:02.71,"idol, because I'm not done yet.It's going to be found."
181,00:12:06.17,00:12:06.17,That's the thing.It's going to be found for sure.
182,00:12:08.33,00:12:08.33,We just don't know when or who'sgoing to find it.
183,00:12:13.21,00:12:13.21,And you can drive yourself nutslooking for it.
184,00:12:19.29,00:12:19.29,>> So you went to that placeover there where we get all the
185,00:12:21.67,00:12:21.67,wood?>> I'm not even going to look
186,00:12:23.12,00:12:23.12,any more.It's driving me crazy.
187,00:12:25.62,00:12:25.62,I have to take a break for alittle bit.

206,00:13:39.42,00:13:39.42,some sort of food.Because it seems like in the

208,00:13:45.12,00:13:45.12,"switch, or anything big happenswhere people come together,"

388,00:23:36.62,00:23:36.62,>> I thought we were one tribe.>> You know it's not one tribe.

428,00:26:25.54,00:26:25.54,You have the afternoon to figureout who is going home.
429,00:26:27.88,00:26:27.88,See you at tribal.Head on back.
430,00:26:50.92,00:26:50.92,">> I swear right now, I'm noteating again."

435,00:27:00.17,00:27:00.17,"You want to eat, you eat.You don't want to eat, you don't"
436,00:27:02.50,00:27:02.50,eat. I don't care.I was just going in there to
437,00:27:04.46,00:27:04.46,"compete, man. That's it.>> Me? 'Cause you're so hot?"
438,00:27:10.88,00:27:10.88,">> I think everybody should shutup, I'm concentrating and you"
439,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,"keep yapping your mouth,I'm like ""Dude, shut up, man."
440,00:27:17.79,00:27:17.79,"Shut up, man.I can't listen to you right"
441,00:27:19.75,00:27:19.75,"now."">> Yaxha, we came into the merge"
442,00:27:23.92,00:27:23.92,with just four people.And Nakum had six.
443,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,And so obviously Jamie called itout today.
444,00:27:29.96,00:27:29.96,We knew our head was on thechopping block.
445,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,But he really called it outtoday.
446,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,"I thought he was very cocky,very arrogant and just a slap in"
447,00:27:36.58,00:27:36.58,the face.>> It wasn't like we were like
448,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,are not welcome here and getlost.
449,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,>> Jamie did not show class atthe challenge whatsoever.
450,00:27:51.04,00:27:51.04,And I think everyone agrees onthat.
451,00:27:53.29,00:27:53.29,"People are seeing this nature inhim, this immaturity and they're"
452,00:27:56.96,00:27:56.96,"not liking it very much.Even Judd's just like, the"
453,00:27:59.92,00:27:59.92,"dude's got keep his mouth shut.>> Dude, shut up, man, shut up."
454,00:28:03.29,00:28:03.29,"Argue later or don't even argueat all, man."
455,00:28:06.12,00:28:06.12,>> We told him again and againjust keep some of your thoughts
456,00:28:08.46,00:28:08.46,to yourself.Because I think it's starting to
457,00:28:10.62,00:28:10.62,come around.It may come around and get him.
458,00:28:14.04,00:28:14.04,">> I just feel so crappy today,you know what I mean?"
459,00:28:18.38,00:28:18.38,"Because like, I know who I wantto be voting with."
460,00:28:20.33,00:28:20.33,>> Yeah.>> I've kind of been asking
461,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"myself like why are yousleeping with the devil,"
462,00:28:26.71,00:28:26.71,almost.And today at the feast it was
463,00:28:28.29,00:28:28.29,like everything justcrystallized in front of my
464,00:28:31.17,00:28:31.17,eyes.I cannot respect myself and go
465,00:28:35.58,00:28:35.58,far in this game with Jamie.>> We're just basically saying
466,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,that Jamie is getting a littletoo cocky and he's not...
467,00:28:48.62,00:28:48.62,>> I am not going to tell himanymore.
468,00:28:50.33,00:28:50.33,I'm not here to baby-sit nobody.>> Right. And we've told him.
469,00:28:53.38,00:28:53.38,">> I told him twice.>> Oh, we are supposed to stand"
470,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,there and take it.>> You didn't say a damn word.
471,00:29:03.08,00:29:03.08,You can't talk when we are inthe middle of a challenge.
472,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,>> I know.>> Jamie is being an idiot right
473,00:29:08.04,00:29:08.04,"now.And he's sitting there, digging"
474,00:29:10.42,00:29:10.42,his own hole in his own tribe.He's probably going home
475,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,tonight.I see these people in this
476,00:29:16.96,00:29:16.96,"tribe, and they're like, theycan't take him anymore."
477,00:29:19.21,00:29:19.21,"He's being arrogant, he's beingcocky."
478,00:29:21.04,00:29:21.04,All he does is mouth off and goto challenges.
479,00:29:24.50,00:29:24.50,At the immunity challenge I wasthinking what if I slipped off
480,00:29:27.29,00:29:27.29,this platform with this bucketon my head and smashed it over
481,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,"his head?>> I was telling Brandon, it"
482,00:29:38.83,00:29:38.83,"sucks, you know, but if you arethe best athlete here, you're"
483,00:29:40.96,00:29:40.96,"going to be going, you know?>> I don't think like that."
484,00:29:45.38,00:29:45.38,"I look at people's character.>> If you had your choice, who'd"
485,00:29:48.96,00:29:48.96,"be going home?>> Man, I ain't even thinking"
486,00:29:51.38,00:29:51.38,"about it right now, Jamie, to behonest with you."
487,00:29:53.42,00:29:53.42,">> Because your head is not onthe chopping block, or what?"
488,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,>> Huh? Is my head on thechopping block?
489,00:29:57.46,00:29:57.46,">> I said it's not on thechopping block, so you're just"
490,00:29:59.08,00:29:59.08,chilling?>> I'm not thinking about it.
491,00:30:02.08,00:30:02.08,"I mean, dude, you know what?if I do go home tonight, then I"
492,00:30:04.58,00:30:04.58,"go home.>> But you know, Brandon's head"
493,00:30:06.46,00:30:06.46,is on the chopping block.>> I definitely wouldn't let
494,00:30:10.71,00:30:10.71,Brandon go home.>> That is whose head is on the
495,00:30:13.00,00:30:13.00,"chopping block today.>> Well, I know mine is too."
496,00:30:15.54,00:30:15.54,">> Well, you, you say that butyou know Brandon's head is on"
497,00:30:19.62,00:30:19.62,"the chopping block.>> Well, you're telling me it"
498,00:30:22.08,00:30:22.08,is.>> You know it is.
499,00:30:23.67,00:30:23.67,">> I know mine is, too.>> I have been honest this whole"
500,00:30:26.33,00:30:26.33,"game, told everybody what is upand you can't even tell me who"
501,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,are you sending home.If you think you'd like to see
502,00:30:32.62,00:30:32.62,"me go home, then just say it.>> No."
503,00:30:35.58,00:30:35.58,">> We are all good farm boys soif you got to say something,"
504,00:30:38.62,00:30:38.62,"say something.>> Are you serious, man?"
505,00:31:27.50,00:31:27.50,>> I guess they could afford tolose one guy.
506,00:31:29.58,00:31:29.58,They're still gonna have usoutnumbered.
507,00:31:35.25,00:31:35.25,">> I'll be damned, man, if itworks out like that."
508,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,I'm going to crap my pants if itworks out like that.
509,00:31:52.75,00:31:52.75,>> I bet you I'm better atcrushing corn than you are.
510,00:31:57.04,00:31:57.04,">> Is that a challenge?>> I just had this, you know, I"
511,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,have been mentally prepared forgoing home.
512,00:32:03.33,00:32:03.33,"I have been thinking about like,oh, man, going home, 21 days,"
513,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,"three weeks.It was a good run, and you know,"
514,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,getting prepared.And now this comes by.
515,00:32:22.12,00:32:22.12,(thunder rumbling)>> Finding that immunity idol
516,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,would be awesome.But you don't know if you over-
517,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,looked it.If you're not looking in the
518,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,"right spot.I mean, I could search out here"
519,00:32:34.21,00:32:34.21,all day long and not find thedamn thing.
520,00:32:36.21,00:32:36.21,"Hell, it's only six inches big,and I don't even know what color"
521,00:32:38.79,00:32:38.79,it looks like.I guess really I'm hoping that
522,00:32:42.08,00:32:42.08,"this one deal goes through anduh, Jamie gets booted off rather"
523,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,than... not myself.People have been saying that
524,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"the whole time, like, ""Thisis Survivor."""
525,00:32:51.25,00:32:51.25,"Things get pushed around, itwill change."
526,00:32:53.67,00:32:53.67,Something will happen.And something is starting to
527,00:32:56.54,00:32:56.54,"happen.>> If we do what's right, we"
528,00:33:09.96,00:33:09.96,vote for Jamie.If we do what's right.
529,00:33:13.67,00:33:13.67,Integrity and what's right.There are five voting against
530,00:33:17.17,00:33:17.17,"him, that's numbers.>> Yeah, but then like,"
531,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,"you know, where does that leaveus?"
532,00:33:26.29,00:33:26.29,">> Still on top, because thenthere's nine."
533,00:33:42.96,00:33:42.96,">> Cindy, hey, do whatever youneed to do, you know what I"
534,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,mean?It's your thing.
535,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,>> But do what you need to do.>> I don't know. I don't know
536,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,what to do.It's really difficult.
537,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,"I told the numbers of six, that,you know, I'm voting for Brandon"
538,00:34:08.96,00:34:08.96,because that is what we decided.But my heart tells me to vote
539,00:34:11.96,00:34:11.96,for Jamie because I thinkBrandon deserves to be here more
540,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,than Jamie.But this game is not about who
541,00:34:17.25,00:34:17.25,you care the most about becauseat some point you have to get
542,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,rid of everybody if you aregoing to win.
543,00:34:22.17,00:34:22.17,So it is really very difficult.I won't know until I write the
544,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,name down on the paper.>> PROBST: Let's talk about
545,00:34:53.83,00:34:53.83,"today's events, a lot going onout there."

548,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"when Jamie said ""Judd's up thereto protect our lead,"" implying"
549,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,he's up there to protect thisalliance.
550,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,">> For me it was hard to hearthe comments Jamie was making,"
551,00:35:11.50,00:35:11.50,just because I didn't want it tobecome something like us versus
552,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,them or six versus four oranything like that.
553,00:35:18.42,00:35:18.42,Which I guess was a little bitnaive in the game of Survivor.
554,00:35:21.92,00:35:21.92,This is a game about numbers.But this is also a game about
555,00:35:24.79,00:35:24.79,"respecting each other and, like,I get really frustrated when we"
556,00:35:27.67,00:35:27.67,"don't do that.>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, where does"
557,00:35:30.21,00:35:30.21,it sit with you?>> I just thought that was just
558,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"no class.I mean, for somebody to sit"

566,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,is when you have a chance forimmunity but you knew you had
567,00:35:52.42,00:35:52.42,the numbers so you didn't evenask for it.
568,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,You thought you were too good toask for it.
569,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,>> 'Cause I knew that night Iwas safe and I am an adult.
570,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,>> Try and let the people battlefor it who need it.
571,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,>> Brian needed immunity thatnight.
572,00:36:04.08,00:36:04.08,He could have asked for it.He didn't get it and I could
573,00:36:05.92,00:36:05.92,have gone home.And Jeff was sitting right
574,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,there.>> You weren't trying to save
575,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,"Brian, though.>> I don't even know what you"

577,00:36:11.71,00:36:11.71,"are saying, but...>> Stop. Stop."
578,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,>> I will let you have what youwant to have.
579,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,">> Okay, okay.>> No one says I have no class."
580,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,"You know, that is justdisrespectful."
581,00:36:20.83,00:36:20.83,I didn't disrespect him likethat.
582,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,"I'm sorry I didn't play in thatgame today, but we we'll see who"
583,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,the bigger man is on the field.(Bobby Jon scoffs)
584,00:36:32.83,00:36:32.83,">> PROBST: Cindy, why were youin the challenge today?"
585,00:36:35.62,00:36:35.62,You seem to be a part of thismagic six.
586,00:36:38.33,00:36:38.33,">> For me, I can eat when I gethome."
587,00:36:40.29,00:36:40.29,But I'll never have the chanceto do what I'm doing here ever
588,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,again.And I'm going to do it as hard
589,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,"as I can.And yeah, it kind of hurt my"
590,00:36:46.75,00:36:46.75,"feelings a little bit, made mefeel like this group of six"
591,00:36:49.58,00:36:49.58,people didn't have the faith inme that they have in Judd.
592,00:36:52.42,00:36:52.42,But I stood there for an hourjust as long as Judd did.
593,00:36:54.92,00:36:54.92,"I did everything I possiblycould, you know."
594,00:36:57.42,00:36:57.42,"It makes things run through yourhead like, ""Well, then, who am"
595,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"I, just standing here for theheck of it?"""
596,00:37:01.96,00:37:01.96,"I'm an idiot for standing here?>> PROBST: Gary, is it fair to"
597,00:37:05.92,00:37:05.92,say that the six people fightingfor immunity today deserve to
598,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,stay in this game more than thefour who chose to eat?
599,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,">> You know, my hope would bethat everybody votes their heart"
600,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,and not their mind.Because at day 21 your mind can
601,00:37:18.08,00:37:18.08,play tricks on you.But when you leave this game and
602,00:37:21.04,00:37:21.04,"39 days are over, your heart isgoing to be one that's gonna"
603,00:37:23.83,00:37:23.83,"tell you what's right and wrong.>> PROBST: Cindy, at this"
604,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,"point in the game, what do youbase your vote on?"
605,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,"Is it as Gary said, heart andmorality and who deserves it, or"
606,00:37:33.25,00:37:33.25,"is it ""As long as it ain't me""?>> I think spending the time"
607,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,that we spend with people outhere and getting to know people
608,00:37:39.50,00:37:39.50,"and the level that you do, thatyour morals and your heart"
609,00:37:42.58,00:37:42.58,definitely come into play agreat deal.
610,00:37:45.58,00:37:45.58,It's impossible to block it outif you even have a heart.
611,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,So it definitely comes into playwhen you are making a decision.
612,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"It does for me.>> PROBST: Okay, before we get"
613,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"to the vote, an immunity idolwas hidden at your camp."
614,00:37:58.92,00:37:58.92,"If anybody has found that andyou want to use it, now is the"
615,00:38:02.88,00:38:02.88,time to present it.Okay.
616,00:38:07.88,00:38:07.88,Either nobody has found the idolor they just don't want to
617,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,"reveal it at this time.Gary has individual immunity,"
618,00:38:14.46,00:38:14.46,he's the only one you cannotvote for.
619,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,Everybody else is fair game.It's time to vote.
620,00:38:19.25,00:38:19.25,"Judd, you're up.>> I have the utmost respect for"
621,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,you.We bled together and we fought
622,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"together, you are a good man.I'm sorry you had to go."
623,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,>> You talk about havingSouthern pride.
624,00:38:55.04,00:38:55.04,"Well, part of having Southernpride is being a Southern"
625,00:38:59.00,00:38:59.00,"gentleman.And no, you don't have any class"
