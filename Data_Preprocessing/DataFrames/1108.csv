2,00:00:02.75,00:00:02.75,"Survivor, the physical nature of the game took its toll on"
3,00:00:05.25,00:00:05.25,Yaxha. >> Everybody over here at Yaxha
4,00:00:07.08,00:00:07.08,has these things all over them.
5,00:00:08.25,00:00:08.25,Got a long way to go on the game so probably gonna get a lot
6,00:00:10.67,00:00:10.67,more banged up than this. >> PROBST: At the challenge the
7,00:00:12.33,00:00:12.33,tribes competed for a sweet reward.
8,00:00:15.21,00:00:15.21,Today you are playing for chocolate.
9,00:00:18.04,00:00:18.04,">> Oh, my God. Also, the winning tribe will get"
10,00:00:20.17,00:00:20.17,a chance to take part in a zip line canopy tour of the jungles
11,00:00:24.12,00:00:24.12,of Guatemala. Survivors ready? Go.
12,00:00:27.04,00:00:27.04,Nakum fell behind. Bobby Jon is out.
13,00:00:30.29,00:00:30.29,Nakum panicking. As Yaxha sprinted to victory.
14,00:00:34.25,00:00:34.25,"Yaxha wins reward. Flying high from their win,"
15,00:00:38.12,00:00:38.12,Yaxha took the ride of their life.
16,00:00:40.29,00:00:40.29,>> We got to swing through the jungle on these cables and felt
17,00:00:42.62,00:00:42.62,just majestic. >> PROBST: And at the end of the
18,00:00:45.62,00:00:45.62,tour they found their chocolate feast.
19,00:00:48.08,00:00:48.08,>> I'm gonna remember today for two reasons.
20,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,"The day I went rip cording through a jungle, and the day"
21,00:00:53.00,00:00:53.00,that I ate the most chocolate I have ever eaten in my
22,00:00:56.58,00:00:56.58,entire life. >> PROBST: The next day Yaxha
23,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,surprised Nakum with a visit. >> Hi!
24,00:01:02.50,00:01:02.50,">> Oh, what are you guys up to, man?"
25,00:01:04.38,00:01:04.38,>> It's my birthday so we figured we would invite you for
26,00:01:06.33,00:01:06.33,"a pool party. >> PROBST: At the party, Jamie"
27,00:01:08.71,00:01:08.71,didn't like the idea of the two tribes meeting.
28,00:01:11.54,00:01:11.54,>> I was worried that maybe Stephanie was getting along too
29,00:01:13.21,00:01:13.21,"well with other people, maybe she would, you know, form bonds"
30,00:01:15.75,00:01:15.75,there. I'm here for business.
31,00:01:17.29,00:01:17.29,And everyone else should be also.
32,00:01:19.04,00:01:19.04,>> PROBST: For immunity the tribes raced to unearth pieces
33,00:01:21.83,00:01:21.83,of a puzzle. They're heavy with that sand.
34,00:01:24.58,00:01:24.58,The game was close but Nakum assembled their puzzle first.
35,00:01:28.50,00:01:28.50,"Nakum wins immunity! Back at Yaxha, Amy felt she was"
36,00:01:32.88,00:01:32.88,next to go. >> I knew going into this if we
37,00:01:35.29,00:01:35.29,didn't win the immunity I had an uphill battle.
38,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,>> PROBST: But Brandon and Danni were still undecided.
39,00:01:40.79,00:01:40.79,">> I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, you know?"
40,00:01:42.38,00:01:42.38,>> Yeah. >> I'm conflicted because here I
41,00:01:45.12,00:01:45.12,"have my alliance with Bobby Jon, but I believe that Gary and Amy"
42,00:01:50.25,00:01:50.25,maybe deserve to be here a little bit more than he does.
43,00:01:54.62,00:01:54.62,">> PROBST: With Bobby Jon and Amy both at risk, the tribe"
44,00:01:57.50,00:01:57.50,voted out the weaker of the two. Then the game took an unexpected
45,00:02:02.21,00:02:02.21,turn. The four of you will not go back
46,00:02:05.38,00:02:05.38,to your camp. You will go directly to Nakum's
47,00:02:08.17,00:02:08.17,"camp. All of your personal items, all"
48,00:02:10.88,00:02:10.88,"the rewards you've won, will be relocated."
49,00:02:13.92,00:02:13.92,You are going to merge into one new tribe.
50,00:02:16.67,00:02:16.67,"Ten are left, who will be voted out tonight?"

53,00:03:36.04,00:03:36.04,(animals calling) >> We just went to Tribal
54,00:03:54.42,00:03:54.42,Council and then Jeff turns to us and says here is your new
55,00:03:57.88,00:03:57.88,"buffs, you are not going back to your camp, you are heading over"
56,00:04:00.79,00:04:00.79,to Nakum for a merge. >> We were walking up to the
57,00:04:17.04,00:04:17.04,"Nakum camp for the first time; myself, Danni, Brandon and Gary,"
58,00:04:20.79,00:04:20.79,"and we just told each other look, hey, we're in this thing"
59,00:04:24.17,00:04:24.17,"together, and we don't know what's going to happen."
60,00:04:30.04,00:04:30.04,>> I twisted my ankle. >> It was real tough for me to
61,00:04:34.12,00:04:34.12,walk in here tonight because I can't be around Stephanie for
62,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,more than five minutes without wanting to vomit.
63,00:04:38.38,00:04:38.38,And I can't be around Jamie for more than five minutes without
64,00:04:40.67,00:04:40.67,wanting to knock him out. So I don't know what I'm going
65,00:04:42.58,00:04:42.58,to do. >> We have some new buffs for
66,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,you. >> Hey!
67,00:04:48.50,00:04:48.50,">> Oh, my God. >> Gary."
68,00:04:51.33,00:04:51.33,">> What's up, big fella? >> Gary."
69,00:04:53.04,00:04:53.04,>> What's going on? What happened?
70,00:04:55.25,00:04:55.25,">> Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. >> Who got voted out?"
71,00:05:00.71,00:05:00.71,>> Amy. >> They brought us straight
72,00:05:02.83,00:05:02.83,from tribal. >> Are you freaking kidding?
73,00:05:04.92,00:05:04.92,">> Merge, baby, merge. >> Hey, ya'll, why don't you"
74,00:05:09.79,00:05:09.79,"come over here and get a buff. >> These are nice, huh?"
75,00:05:12.42,00:05:12.42,>> And they don't stink. >> Yaxha came here immediately
76,00:05:17.79,00:05:17.79,after Tribal Council and basically gave us new buffs and
77,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67,told us there was a merge. So we were all thrown for a
78,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,"loop. My head is, like, spinning."
79,00:05:26.12,00:05:26.12,">> Come on, let's get that fire started."
80,00:05:32.46,00:05:32.46,">> I just came into camp and started doing my thing, man."
81,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"Right when I started getting the fire, here comes Jamie over"
82,00:05:37.42,00:05:37.42,there. >> There's not room in the
83,00:05:39.79,00:05:39.79,shelter. I hope they don't mind sleeping
84,00:05:41.21,00:05:41.21,"outside. >> He said something smart, I'm"
85,00:05:43.79,00:05:43.79,"just like, ""Dude, you going to say one more thing to me I'm"
86,00:05:46.38,00:05:46.38,"going to knock every one of your teeth slam out of your head."""
87,00:05:59.71,00:05:59.71,>> Ooh. Is that a log? >> Yeah.
88,00:06:02.42,00:06:02.42,>> Wow! >> Bobby Jon is just looking for
89,00:06:11.08,00:06:11.08,"something to do, man. (laughter)"
90,00:06:13.75,00:06:13.75,>> I ain't trying to be the hero.
91,00:06:15.25,00:06:15.25,">> You gonna chill out, brother, or what?"
92,00:06:18.71,00:06:18.71,">> This morning woke up, and, you know, like I mean it wasn't"
93,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,a dream after all. We really merged and everything.
94,00:06:24.71,00:06:24.71,"And you know, a new tribe. And you think, ""Whee,"" you know,"
95,00:06:27.38,00:06:27.38,one big happy family. That's not how it works.
96,00:06:33.46,00:06:33.46,(scoffs) >> I don't think we have any
97,00:06:36.33,00:06:36.33,more wood to get. I think you're okay.
98,00:06:38.04,00:06:38.04,"Why don't you sit down? >> Nakum, we came over..."
99,00:06:45.04,00:06:45.04,I didn't think they were that warm and friendly.
100,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,"Brandon, Bobby Jon and myself, I think Gary does, too,"
101,00:06:49.46,00:06:49.46,"we feel kind of like we are slaves, because we know our"
102,00:06:53.17,00:06:53.17,head's on the chopping block and we will try to do what you can
103,00:06:55.12,00:06:55.12,to stick around. But you feel like an outsider.
104,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,>> This whole deal kind of sucks.
105,00:07:02.92,00:07:02.92,"You know, there's four of us from the Yaxha tribe and six of"
106,00:07:06.54,00:07:06.54,them from the Nakum tribe. >> Now we can make room on the
107,00:07:09.42,00:07:09.42,fire. Should we put it on the grill or
108,00:07:11.21,00:07:11.21,what? >> I think myself or Bobby Jon
109,00:07:14.46,00:07:14.46,are probably gonna be first on the chopping block.
110,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,"We are probably most likely to get immunity, so they want to"
111,00:07:18.92,00:07:18.92,get those guys out first. And things aren't looking very
112,00:07:22.21,00:07:22.21,up to tell you the truth. >> I hope it's not a freakin'
113,00:07:30.33,00:07:30.33,Reward Challenge. We'll open tree mail and
114,00:07:32.62,00:07:32.62,there'll be a pig inside. >> Or a Mayan feast.
115,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,"Oh, my God. It's a basket."
116,00:07:38.67,00:07:38.67,It's a basket. What is it?
117,00:07:41.71,00:07:41.71,">> Okay, here we go. >> ""Congratulations, you are now"
118,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,one tribe. Here's your new flag and paints
119,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50,for you to add to your new tribe name.
120,00:07:49.21,00:07:49.21,If you are feeling bored around camp or could use some peace of
121,00:07:51.75,00:07:51.75,"mind in this game, there is a small individual immunity idol"
122,00:07:55.25,00:07:55.25,hidden in the woods. This is in addition to any
123,00:07:59.25,00:07:59.25,individual immunity you win at challenges.
124,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,"It is about six inches tall and is made of stone."""
125,00:08:05.08,00:08:05.08,">> What? >> ""Find it and you have power."
126,00:08:08.12,00:08:08.12,You can use it at any time to save yourself.
127,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,"""You don't need to tell anyone you have it, but if are you"
128,00:08:12.54,00:08:12.54,"going to use it, you must ""present it at any Tribal"
129,00:08:15.17,00:08:15.17,"Council before the vote."" >> ""But the idol's powers expire"
130,00:08:17.67,00:08:17.67,"when are you down to the Final Four."""
131,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,>> So hidden somewhere in the woods there is an idol that will
132,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,give us immunity that we can use at any Tribal Council up to the
133,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,Final Four. Somewhere there's individual
134,00:08:32.08,00:08:32.08,immunity hidden in the woods to use any time you want.
135,00:08:37.62,00:08:37.62,>> We got tree mail saying that there's a little immunity idol
136,00:08:42.83,00:08:42.83,about this big in a jungle that's this big.
137,00:08:53.21,00:08:53.21,>> So the search is on. Finding the secret immunity idol
138,00:08:57.08,00:08:57.08,"could be huge for anyone. If you use it right, you can"
139,00:09:00.62,00:09:00.62,almost guarantee yourself to the Final Four.
140,00:09:04.42,00:09:04.42,>> You checking this area out? >> I think it's going to be
141,00:09:06.54,00:09:06.54,"someplace around the temple, don't you?"
142,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,">> If I find the idol, I am not telling anybody."
143,00:09:10.12,00:09:10.12,"I wouldn't come prancing into camp saying, ""Hey, I found the"
144,00:09:12.08,00:09:12.08,"idol."" No way. I wouldn't do it."
145,00:09:16.17,00:09:16.17,>> It's going to be like finding a needle in the hay stack.
146,00:09:20.21,00:09:20.21,You could be looking for days and days and days for the damn
147,00:09:22.58,00:09:22.58,thing and still not find it. And I got a target right on my
148,00:09:25.71,00:09:25.71,"head, you know. And so I could really use it."
149,00:09:29.67,00:09:29.67,"Like, really. >> Got to find that idol, man."
150,00:10:10.00,00:10:10.00,>> Bobby Jon was looking for the idol.
151,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,"And he said, ""I'm not asking for an alliance or anything like"
152,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50,"that."" He's like, ""I'm just asking to"
153,00:10:18.75,00:10:18.75,"help me out so at least I make the jury this time."""
154,00:10:21.08,00:10:21.08,"And I said, you know, ""I totally understand but I can't make any"
155,00:10:24.12,00:10:24.12,"promises."" It's going to be either him or"
156,00:10:27.04,00:10:27.04,"Brandon that goes. >> Good morning, everyone."
157,00:10:47.75,00:10:47.75,"So, have we thought of a name? Anybody?"
158,00:10:51.71,00:10:51.71,>> What's that? >> Have we thought of a name?
159,00:10:55.79,00:10:55.79,">> What are you thinking, Cindy? >> Take the two names and blend"
160,00:10:59.50,00:10:59.50,them. >> Yeah.
161,00:11:01.88,00:11:01.88,>> Xhakum. >> I like that.
162,00:11:03.92,00:11:03.92,"That sounds catchy. Ba-ba-boom, Xhakum. Hey!"
163,00:11:08.42,00:11:08.42,>> I wanted to get our new Xhakum flag started.
164,00:11:11.92,00:11:11.92,Xhakum to us means to us Yaxha and Nakum put together.
165,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,"So we are one big happy tribe, right now."
166,00:11:20.04,00:11:20.04,"Everything is A-OK. >> Oh, it's so beautiful, you"
167,00:11:23.17,00:11:23.17,"guys. >> That looks nice, huh?"
168,00:11:25.79,00:11:25.79,>> Xhakum. Very nice.
169,00:11:28.04,00:11:28.04,Look at that. >> What's up?
170,00:11:30.62,00:11:30.62,>> The quest for the idol is still under way.
171,00:11:33.67,00:11:33.67,"I can tell you where it is not, back there."
172,00:11:36.67,00:11:36.67,>> It's not back there? >> Mm-mm.
173,00:11:39.04,00:11:39.04,>> Also not back there. >> That idol could be worth a
174,00:11:42.08,00:11:42.08,million dollars. I have been looking for it
175,00:11:43.92,00:11:43.92,because I don't want any of the old Yaxha to have it.
176,00:11:46.54,00:11:46.54,That would put a hurting on my plan.
177,00:11:50.17,00:11:50.17,>> I've got to take a leak. Maybe I will take a leak all
178,00:11:52.00,00:11:52.00,"over that idol. >> Me, Gary, Danni and Brandon"
179,00:11:57.50,00:11:57.50,up here are sitting ducks pretty much.
180,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,So I spend about an hour each day looking for the immunity
181,00:12:02.71,00:12:02.71,"idol, because I'm not done yet. It's going to be found."
182,00:12:06.17,00:12:06.17,That's the thing. It's going to be found for sure.
183,00:12:08.33,00:12:08.33,We just don't know when or who's going to find it.
184,00:12:13.21,00:12:13.21,And you can drive yourself nuts looking for it.
185,00:12:19.29,00:12:19.29,>> So you went to that place over there where we get all the
186,00:12:21.67,00:12:21.67,wood? >> I'm not even going to look
187,00:12:23.12,00:12:23.12,any more. It's driving me crazy.
188,00:12:25.62,00:12:25.62,I have to take a break for a little bit.
189,00:12:28.21,00:12:28.21,"I mean I'm exhausted, man. Up and down, up and down, up and"
190,00:12:31.62,00:12:31.62,down. >> Let's just go chill then.
191,00:12:35.08,00:12:35.08,>> I really want to find it. I really feel like it's here but
192,00:12:38.29,00:12:38.29,I cannot find it anywhere. And I'm horrible at looking for
193,00:12:41.96,00:12:41.96,things. I'm just the worst person at
194,00:12:44.25,00:12:44.25,finding anything in the world. So my odds of getting this
195,00:12:48.08,00:12:48.08,immunity idol are a little bit low.
196,00:12:51.50,00:12:51.50,( insects buzzing ) I'm searching for the immunity
197,00:12:55.12,00:12:55.12,"idol and I reach up and put my hand, like, in a hornet's nest"
198,00:13:00.62,00:13:00.62,at the top of this temple. I just got attacked by hornets.
199,00:13:08.25,00:13:08.25,I'm done. That was just the signal from
200,00:13:09.88,00:13:09.88,the Mayan gods that I am not meant to find this idol.
201,00:13:22.96,00:13:22.96,">> What you doing there, big guy?"
202,00:13:24.83,00:13:24.83,">> I'm just going to make a couple more flies up, just in"
203,00:13:28.08,00:13:28.08,case. >> For all those big fish we're
204,00:13:31.25,00:13:31.25,going to catch. >> Yeah.
205,00:13:34.92,00:13:34.92,>> Right. >> Fish fry.
206,00:13:37.21,00:13:37.21,>> Yeah. I was really expecting
207,00:13:39.42,00:13:39.42,some sort of food. Because it seems like in the
208,00:13:41.83,00:13:41.83,game of Survivor whenever a season merges or the teams
209,00:13:45.12,00:13:45.12,"switch, or anything big happens where people come together,"
210,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,"there is always food involved. And I mean, an immunity idol"
211,00:13:51.38,00:13:51.38,"like that is cool and all, but we're like starving."
212,00:13:53.71,00:13:53.71,So I would much rather feast. But whatever.
213,00:13:58.83,00:13:58.83,Survivor. >> This will be the first time
214,00:14:03.04,00:14:03.04,there's ever a merge without a celebration.
215,00:14:06.42,00:14:06.42,>> That's pretty sad. >> I'm sad already.
216,00:14:09.79,00:14:09.79,">> You know, we had camp over at Yaxha, it was positive."
217,00:14:12.46,00:14:12.46,We had fun. We all got along.
218,00:14:15.04,00:14:15.04,"And come over here, and it is just like, they just complain"
219,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,all the time. >> Come on.
220,00:14:21.25,00:14:21.25,Two days into the merge already and we didn't have a feast?
221,00:14:24.58,00:14:24.58,">> That's retarded. >> I'm bored out of my mind,"
222,00:14:27.38,00:14:27.38,too. >> It was just so negative here
223,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,"at camp. I mean, just complaining about"
224,00:14:33.04,00:14:33.04,not having food or not having anything to do.
225,00:14:36.08,00:14:36.08,"And so we just said we needed to get out, get away for a little"
226,00:14:41.04,00:14:41.04,bit. Go fishing.
227,00:14:42.75,00:14:42.75,>> Do you want to go fishing? >> Ready?
228,00:14:44.42,00:14:44.42,">> Yeah, fishing. >> Keep dreaming, baby."
229,00:14:55.29,00:14:55.29,>> Is there any chocolate left? >> Do we have any honey left?
230,00:14:59.12,00:14:59.12,>> We are devils. >> I don't care. They went
231,00:15:01.25,00:15:01.25,"fishing and it's a slap in the face, you know?"
232,00:15:03.83,00:15:03.83,>> I can't believe they are all really that dumb to all go
233,00:15:06.54,00:15:06.54,together. >> If they were even strategic
234,00:15:08.79,00:15:08.79,they wouldn't have gone all together to go fishing because
235,00:15:11.08,00:15:11.08,they wouldn't leave us six here to plot our next plan.
236,00:15:14.29,00:15:14.29,">> You know, we can hang out and eat honey while they go fishing."
237,00:15:19.25,00:15:19.25,"I'm not, like... I'm not totally cool with that"
238,00:15:22.33,00:15:22.33,kind of like that kind of attitude like we are in control
239,00:15:25.00,00:15:25.00,now. So we don't have to do anything.
240,00:15:26.71,00:15:26.71,And we have to make them do everything.
241,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,">> It's like we're at war, man. Prisoners."
242,00:15:33.25,00:15:33.25,We have to do all their bitch work and they get to raid all
243,00:15:35.83,00:15:35.83,our resources and all our other stuff that we worked hard to
244,00:15:39.42,00:15:39.42,acquire. >> They went right through our
245,00:15:41.38,00:15:41.38,stuff when we came over. Didn't even ask.
246,00:15:43.67,00:15:43.67,">> Like a bunch of pigs. >> All right, let's do this."
247,00:15:46.21,00:15:46.21,Whoever catches the biggest fish goes home first.
248,00:15:48.29,00:15:48.29,">> Yeah, whoever catches the biggest fish goes home first."
249,00:15:51.38,00:15:51.38,>> You guys are crazy. >> How does that sound?
250,00:15:56.58,00:15:56.58,>> I kind of had this really sad realization.
251,00:16:00.17,00:16:00.17,Am I a member of the axis of evil?
252,00:16:03.75,00:16:03.75,">> Man, they better bring some fish back."
253,00:16:06.04,00:16:06.04,">> They better get their ass up tomorrow morning, too."
254,00:16:08.04,00:16:08.04,"Before they catch a damn six footer, man."
255,00:16:11.50,00:16:11.50,>> Bashing people when they are not around to bring group unity
256,00:16:14.71,00:16:14.71,is not a pretty way to play this game.
257,00:16:18.12,00:16:18.12,>> Let's make sure we got it. >> So Brandon. Brandon...
258,00:16:21.25,00:16:21.25,">> Is that what we said? >> Brandon, Bobby Jon and then"
259,00:16:24.08,00:16:24.08,Danni. >> Right.
260,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,">> Stephanie bitches a lot, man. >> She sure does."
261,00:16:31.38,00:16:31.38,All they do is complain. >> They complain so much.
262,00:16:34.17,00:16:34.17,"Talk about food, complain. You ain't going to eat on"
263,00:16:36.54,00:16:36.54,Survivor. They ain't never ate on
264,00:16:38.04,00:16:38.04,Survivor. You ain't going to eat on this
265,00:16:39.75,00:16:39.75,Survivor. You ain't going to eat on the
266,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,next Survivor. So why you want to talk about
267,00:16:42.79,00:16:42.79,it? >> If we are smart we will go
268,00:16:52.21,00:16:52.21,"ahead and not worry about it, and we'll just keep knocking"
269,00:16:54.21,00:16:54.21,them off like we wanted to. >> Knock them out one by one.
270,00:16:56.58,00:16:56.58,>> Nobody over there is going to save anybody's ass.
271,00:16:58.38,00:16:58.38,They are all out there for themselves.
272,00:16:59.96,00:16:59.96,That is how it was in the old tribe.
273,00:17:01.08,00:17:01.08,>> It's not time to be nice anymore.
274,00:17:02.92,00:17:02.92,"It's time to protect our investment of, you know, blood"
275,00:17:05.12,00:17:05.12,"and sweat, and it's time to let those guys go home."
276,00:17:09.12,00:17:09.12,>> We're awesome and everybody else sucks.
277,00:17:12.17,00:17:12.17,>> I say they are some of the most wonderful people I ever met
278,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,in my life. >> I'll say it right back.
279,00:17:17.62,00:17:17.62,All of them. (laughter)
280,00:17:30.54,00:17:30.54,"(overlapping chatter) >> Nice, nice having this pool"
281,00:17:36.71,00:17:36.71,"right next to our camp. Unfortunately, our beach is like"
282,00:17:40.50,00:17:40.50,"quicksand so it had to be anchored out here, so we come"
283,00:17:42.75,00:17:42.75,"and go as a tribe, which is kind of nice."
284,00:17:45.71,00:17:45.71,For those days that we're really bored and our days off and
285,00:17:47.67,00:17:47.67,"stuff, we just hang out here and just enjoy ourselves."
286,00:17:53.38,00:17:53.38,">> Everybody just kind of hanging out, kind of waiting on"
287,00:17:57.04,00:17:57.04,"tree mail, to be honest with you."
288,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,"I don't think, I don't know, I just don't think that the"
289,00:18:04.25,00:18:04.25,Nakum's fairy tale right now is going to quite come true.
290,00:18:07.62,00:18:07.62,They really think that those six are going to make it down to the
291,00:18:10.38,00:18:10.38,final six. But for some reason I just don't
292,00:18:13.00,00:18:13.00,think that's going to happen. >> It's a box.
293,00:18:22.17,00:18:22.17,>> What the heck? >> What the heck?
294,00:18:24.96,00:18:24.96,>> I don't know. A message.

333,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,I'm out here to play the game and do what I've got to do.

377,00:22:35.08,00:22:35.08,"If after one hour we are still going, we will move to a tie"
378,00:22:38.88,00:22:38.88,breaker. Make sense?
379,00:22:42.46,00:22:42.46,We'll get started. Everybody's pot is in place and
380,00:22:53.21,00:22:53.21,this challenge has begun. You can start eating.
381,00:23:02.54,00:23:02.54,">> Oh, my God. >> It's good."
382,00:23:14.12,00:23:14.12,>> This is so good. >> PROBST: How's the food?
383,00:23:23.38,00:23:23.38,>> Good. >> Mmm. Very good.
384,00:23:25.67,00:23:25.67,>> PROBST: Did you expect to see four people sitting down to eat?
385,00:23:28.62,00:23:28.62,>> Brandon and Bobby Jon know they have a chance to go home
386,00:23:30.83,00:23:30.83,tonight. They are the best two athletes
387,00:23:32.46,00:23:32.46,in the group. I think Judd wants to protect
388,00:23:34.04,00:23:34.04,our lead. I look up to him for it.
389,00:23:36.62,00:23:36.62,>> I thought we were one tribe. >> You know it's not one tribe.
390,00:23:39.46,00:23:39.46,">> Yeah, but... >> So why are you saying that"
391,00:23:40.83,00:23:40.83,"right now? >> Well, because I can."
392,00:23:42.50,00:23:42.50,And I will. And I want to.
393,00:23:44.25,00:23:44.25,">> PROBST: Well, Jamie so you le the cat out of the bag."
394,00:23:46.25,00:23:46.25,So clearly it is no big secret. You said Judd is up there
395,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,"""protecting our lead."" Whose the ""our""?"
396,00:23:53.79,00:23:53.79,It must be you four and Judd. So it's tribal lines all the
397,00:23:59.21,00:23:59.21,way. >> Yup.
398,00:24:01.46,00:24:01.46,>> I have been knowing the whole time what is going on.
399,00:24:03.54,00:24:03.54,">> Bobby Jon, you knew you had to win immunity today, bud."
400,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,">> I'm not trying to, it's just when you start going off at the"
401,00:24:10.08,00:24:10.08,mouth I'm ain't gonna let you big boy me though.
402,00:24:18.33,00:24:18.33,>> PROBST: You are 30 minutes in Never has 30 minutes seemed so
403,00:24:23.88,00:24:23.88,"long. >> Good job, Judd."
404,00:24:29.54,00:24:29.54,">> How are you doing, Bobby Jon? Good?"
405,00:24:33.08,00:24:33.08,>> Are you consciously trying to rub it in?
406,00:24:57.25,00:24:57.25,">> PROBST: Danni makes the slightest move, Danni's out."
407,00:25:01.96,00:25:01.96,Take a spot on the mat. And we are reaching the end of
408,00:25:09.62,00:25:09.62,"the hour. Five, four, three, two, one."
409,00:25:15.46,00:25:15.46,"You're there. Cindy, Brandon, Gary, Judd,"
410,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,"Bobby Jon, moving on to a tie breaker."
411,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,Slowly bring your hands up to your pot.
412,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,"Step down. >> Good job, guys."
413,00:25:28.04,00:25:28.04,(applause) >> PROBST: Let's go.
414,00:25:29.21,00:25:29.21,"Head over to the pyramid. For the tie breaker, you will"
415,00:25:32.42,00:25:32.42,race up the steps of the pyramid.
416,00:25:35.17,00:25:35.17,No hands can touch your pot at any time.
417,00:25:38.17,00:25:38.17,"First person to the top or the person who goes the furthest,"
418,00:25:42.04,00:25:42.04,without breaking their pot wins immunity.
419,00:25:44.88,00:25:44.88,"Here we go, guys. Survivors ready?"
420,00:25:49.75,00:25:49.75,Go! Gary and Brandon moving out
421,00:25:53.04,00:25:53.04,quickly. Bobby Jon right behind.
422,00:25:55.12,00:25:55.12,Cindy's out. It's Gary and Brandon.
423,00:25:58.75,00:25:58.75,Bobby Jon coming up. Brandon's out.
424,00:26:01.25,00:26:01.25,Bobby Jon's out. >> Way to go Gary!
425,00:26:05.42,00:26:05.42,>> PROBST: Gary wins immunity. Nice job.
426,00:26:07.62,00:26:07.62,">> Good job, guys. >> PROBST: Gary, the only person"
427,00:26:17.42,00:26:17.42,safe from Tribal Council tonight unless someone finds the hidden
428,00:26:22.54,00:26:22.54,immunity idol or perhaps has already found it.
429,00:26:25.54,00:26:25.54,You have the afternoon to figure out who is going home.
430,00:26:27.88,00:26:27.88,See you at tribal. Head on back.
431,00:26:50.92,00:26:50.92,">> I swear right now, I'm not eating again."
432,00:26:52.62,00:26:52.62,>> I don't care what you do. You guys can do whatever you
433,00:26:54.96,00:26:54.96,want. I don't care what you do.
434,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,">> Unless everybody's going to eat, I'm not eating."
435,00:26:58.29,00:26:58.29,">> You know me, I don't care what you do."
436,00:27:00.17,00:27:00.17,"You want to eat, you eat. You don't want to eat, you don't"
437,00:27:02.50,00:27:02.50,eat. I don't care. I was just going in there to
438,00:27:04.46,00:27:04.46,"compete, man. That's it. >> Me? 'Cause you're so hot?"
439,00:27:10.88,00:27:10.88,">> I think everybody should shut up, I'm concentrating and you"
440,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,"keep yapping your mouth, I'm like ""Dude, shut up, man."
441,00:27:17.79,00:27:17.79,"Shut up, man. I can't listen to you right"
442,00:27:19.75,00:27:19.75,"now."" >> Yaxha, we came into the merge"
443,00:27:23.92,00:27:23.92,with just four people. And Nakum had six.
444,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,And so obviously Jamie called it out today.
445,00:27:29.96,00:27:29.96,We knew our head was on the chopping block.
446,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,But he really called it out today.
447,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,"I thought he was very cocky, very arrogant and just a slap in"
448,00:27:36.58,00:27:36.58,the face. >> It wasn't like we were like
449,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,are not welcome here and get lost.
450,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,>> Jamie did not show class at the challenge whatsoever.
451,00:27:51.04,00:27:51.04,And I think everyone agrees on that.
452,00:27:53.29,00:27:53.29,"People are seeing this nature in him, this immaturity and they're"
453,00:27:56.96,00:27:56.96,"not liking it very much. Even Judd's just like, the"
454,00:27:59.92,00:27:59.92,"dude's got keep his mouth shut. >> Dude, shut up, man, shut up."
455,00:28:03.29,00:28:03.29,"Argue later or don't even argue at all, man."
456,00:28:06.12,00:28:06.12,>> We told him again and again just keep some of your thoughts
457,00:28:08.46,00:28:08.46,to yourself. Because I think it's starting to
458,00:28:10.62,00:28:10.62,come around. It may come around and get him.
459,00:28:14.04,00:28:14.04,">> I just feel so crappy today, you know what I mean?"
460,00:28:18.38,00:28:18.38,"Because like, I know who I want to be voting with."
461,00:28:20.33,00:28:20.33,>> Yeah. >> I've kind of been asking
462,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"myself like why are you sleeping with the devil,"
463,00:28:26.71,00:28:26.71,almost. And today at the feast it was
464,00:28:28.29,00:28:28.29,like everything just crystallized in front of my
465,00:28:31.17,00:28:31.17,eyes. I cannot respect myself and go
466,00:28:35.58,00:28:35.58,far in this game with Jamie. >> We're just basically saying
467,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,that Jamie is getting a little too cocky and he's not...
468,00:28:48.62,00:28:48.62,>> I am not going to tell him anymore.
469,00:28:50.33,00:28:50.33,I'm not here to baby-sit nobody. >> Right. And we've told him.
470,00:28:53.38,00:28:53.38,">> I told him twice. >> Oh, we are supposed to stand"
471,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,there and take it. >> You didn't say a damn word.
472,00:29:03.08,00:29:03.08,You can't talk when we are in the middle of a challenge.
473,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,>> I know. >> Jamie is being an idiot right
474,00:29:08.04,00:29:08.04,"now. And he's sitting there, digging"
475,00:29:10.42,00:29:10.42,his own hole in his own tribe. He's probably going home
476,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,tonight. I see these people in this
477,00:29:16.96,00:29:16.96,"tribe, and they're like, they can't take him anymore."
478,00:29:19.21,00:29:19.21,"He's being arrogant, he's being cocky."
479,00:29:21.04,00:29:21.04,All he does is mouth off and go to challenges.
480,00:29:24.50,00:29:24.50,At the immunity challenge I was thinking what if I slipped off
481,00:29:27.29,00:29:27.29,this platform with this bucket on my head and smashed it over
482,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,"his head? >> I was telling Brandon, it"
483,00:29:38.83,00:29:38.83,"sucks, you know, but if you are the best athlete here, you're"
484,00:29:40.96,00:29:40.96,"going to be going, you know? >> I don't think like that."
485,00:29:45.38,00:29:45.38,"I look at people's character. >> If you had your choice, who'd"
486,00:29:48.96,00:29:48.96,"be going home? >> Man, I ain't even thinking"
487,00:29:51.38,00:29:51.38,"about it right now, Jamie, to be honest with you."
488,00:29:53.42,00:29:53.42,">> Because your head is not on the chopping block, or what?"
489,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,>> Huh? Is my head on the chopping block?
490,00:29:57.46,00:29:57.46,">> I said it's not on the chopping block, so you're just"
491,00:29:59.08,00:29:59.08,chilling? >> I'm not thinking about it.
492,00:30:02.08,00:30:02.08,"I mean, dude, you know what? if I do go home tonight, then I"
493,00:30:04.58,00:30:04.58,"go home. >> But you know, Brandon's head"
494,00:30:06.46,00:30:06.46,is on the chopping block. >> I definitely wouldn't let
495,00:30:10.71,00:30:10.71,Brandon go home. >> That is whose head is on the
496,00:30:13.00,00:30:13.00,"chopping block today. >> Well, I know mine is too."
497,00:30:15.54,00:30:15.54,">> Well, you, you say that but you know Brandon's head is on"
498,00:30:19.62,00:30:19.62,"the chopping block. >> Well, you're telling me it"
499,00:30:22.08,00:30:22.08,is. >> You know it is.
500,00:30:23.67,00:30:23.67,">> I know mine is, too. >> I have been honest this whole"
501,00:30:26.33,00:30:26.33,"game, told everybody what is up and you can't even tell me who"
502,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,are you sending home. If you think you'd like to see
503,00:30:32.62,00:30:32.62,"me go home, then just say it. >> No."
504,00:30:35.58,00:30:35.58,">> We are all good farm boys so if you got to say something,"
505,00:30:38.62,00:30:38.62,"say something. >> Are you serious, man?"
506,00:31:27.50,00:31:27.50,>> I guess they could afford to lose one guy.
507,00:31:29.58,00:31:29.58,They're still gonna have us outnumbered.
508,00:31:35.25,00:31:35.25,">> I'll be damned, man, if it works out like that."
509,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,I'm going to crap my pants if it works out like that.
510,00:31:52.75,00:31:52.75,>> I bet you I'm better at crushing corn than you are.
511,00:31:57.04,00:31:57.04,">> Is that a challenge? >> I just had this, you know, I"
512,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,have been mentally prepared for going home.
513,00:32:03.33,00:32:03.33,"I have been thinking about like, oh, man, going home, 21 days,"
514,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,"three weeks. It was a good run, and you know,"
515,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,getting prepared. And now this comes by.
516,00:32:22.12,00:32:22.12,(thunder rumbling) >> Finding that immunity idol
517,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,would be awesome. But you don't know if you over-
518,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,looked it. If you're not looking in the
519,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,"right spot. I mean, I could search out here"
520,00:32:34.21,00:32:34.21,all day long and not find the damn thing.
521,00:32:36.21,00:32:36.21,"Hell, it's only six inches big, and I don't even know what color"
522,00:32:38.79,00:32:38.79,it looks like. I guess really I'm hoping that
523,00:32:42.08,00:32:42.08,"this one deal goes through and uh, Jamie gets booted off rather"
524,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,than... not myself. People have been saying that
525,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"the whole time, like, ""This is Survivor."""
526,00:32:51.25,00:32:51.25,"Things get pushed around, it will change."
527,00:32:53.67,00:32:53.67,Something will happen. And something is starting to
528,00:32:56.54,00:32:56.54,"happen. >> If we do what's right, we"
529,00:33:09.96,00:33:09.96,vote for Jamie. If we do what's right.
530,00:33:13.67,00:33:13.67,Integrity and what's right. There are five voting against
531,00:33:17.17,00:33:17.17,"him, that's numbers. >> Yeah, but then like,"
532,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,"you know, where does that leave us?"
533,00:33:26.29,00:33:26.29,">> Still on top, because then there's nine."
534,00:33:42.96,00:33:42.96,">> Cindy, hey, do whatever you need to do, you know what I"
535,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,mean? It's your thing.
536,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,>> But do what you need to do. >> I don't know. I don't know
537,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,what to do. It's really difficult.
538,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,"I told the numbers of six, that, you know, I'm voting for Brandon"
539,00:34:08.96,00:34:08.96,because that is what we decided. But my heart tells me to vote
540,00:34:11.96,00:34:11.96,for Jamie because I think Brandon deserves to be here more
541,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,than Jamie. But this game is not about who
542,00:34:17.25,00:34:17.25,you care the most about because at some point you have to get
543,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,rid of everybody if you are going to win.
544,00:34:22.17,00:34:22.17,So it is really very difficult. I won't know until I write the
545,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,name down on the paper. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
546,00:34:53.83,00:34:53.83,"today's events, a lot going on out there."
547,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,"Some people choosing to eat, some taking part in the"
548,00:34:59.12,00:34:59.12,"challenge. Rafe, were you are surprised"
549,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"when Jamie said ""Judd's up there to protect our lead,"" implying"
550,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,he's up there to protect this alliance.
551,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,">> For me it was hard to hear the comments Jamie was making,"
552,00:35:11.50,00:35:11.50,just because I didn't want it to become something like us versus
553,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,them or six versus four or anything like that.
554,00:35:18.42,00:35:18.42,Which I guess was a little bit naive in the game of Survivor.
555,00:35:21.92,00:35:21.92,This is a game about numbers. But this is also a game about
556,00:35:24.79,00:35:24.79,"respecting each other and, like, I get really frustrated when we"
557,00:35:27.67,00:35:27.67,"don't do that. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon, where does"
558,00:35:30.21,00:35:30.21,it sit with you? >> I just thought that was just
559,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"no class. I mean, for somebody to sit"
560,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"there and say, you know, ""Go Judd, whoo-whoo."""
561,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,I'm just like that is just no class.
562,00:35:38.58,00:35:38.58,"I mean yeah, it's 6-4, whatever, I know that."
563,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,That was just no class. >> I have class.
564,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,So he can think what he wants to think.
565,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,"I'm the bigger man. >> Man, just shut up, dude, I"
566,00:35:48.04,00:35:48.04,"mean, God. >> Bobby Jon, I think no class"
567,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,is when you have a chance for immunity but you knew you had
568,00:35:52.42,00:35:52.42,the numbers so you didn't even ask for it.
569,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,You thought you were too good to ask for it.
570,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,>> 'Cause I knew that night I was safe and I am an adult.
571,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,>> Try and let the people battle for it who need it.
572,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,>> Brian needed immunity that night.
573,00:36:04.08,00:36:04.08,He could have asked for it. He didn't get it and I could
574,00:36:05.92,00:36:05.92,have gone home. And Jeff was sitting right
575,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,there. >> You weren't trying to save
576,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,"Brian, though. >> I don't even know what you"
577,00:36:10.17,00:36:10.17,"are saying, man. >> I don't even know what you"
578,00:36:11.71,00:36:11.71,"are saying, but... >> Stop. Stop."
579,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,>> I will let you have what you want to have.
580,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,">> Okay, okay. >> No one says I have no class."
581,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,"You know, that is just disrespectful."
582,00:36:20.83,00:36:20.83,I didn't disrespect him like that.
583,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,"I'm sorry I didn't play in that game today, but we we'll see who"
584,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,the bigger man is on the field. (Bobby Jon scoffs)
585,00:36:32.83,00:36:32.83,">> PROBST: Cindy, why were you in the challenge today?"
586,00:36:35.62,00:36:35.62,You seem to be a part of this magic six.
587,00:36:38.33,00:36:38.33,">> For me, I can eat when I get home."
588,00:36:40.29,00:36:40.29,But I'll never have the chance to do what I'm doing here ever
589,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,again. And I'm going to do it as hard
590,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,"as I can. And yeah, it kind of hurt my"
591,00:36:46.75,00:36:46.75,"feelings a little bit, made me feel like this group of six"
592,00:36:49.58,00:36:49.58,people didn't have the faith in me that they have in Judd.
593,00:36:52.42,00:36:52.42,But I stood there for an hour just as long as Judd did.
594,00:36:54.92,00:36:54.92,"I did everything I possibly could, you know."
595,00:36:57.42,00:36:57.42,"It makes things run through your head like, ""Well, then, who am"
596,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"I, just standing here for the heck of it?"""
597,00:37:01.96,00:37:01.96,"I'm an idiot for standing here? >> PROBST: Gary, is it fair to"
598,00:37:05.92,00:37:05.92,say that the six people fighting for immunity today deserve to
599,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,stay in this game more than the four who chose to eat?
600,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,">> You know, my hope would be that everybody votes their heart"
601,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,and not their mind. Because at day 21 your mind can
602,00:37:18.08,00:37:18.08,play tricks on you. But when you leave this game and
603,00:37:21.04,00:37:21.04,"39 days are over, your heart is going to be one that's gonna"
604,00:37:23.83,00:37:23.83,"tell you what's right and wrong. >> PROBST: Cindy, at this"
605,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,"point in the game, what do you base your vote on?"
606,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,"Is it as Gary said, heart and morality and who deserves it, or"
607,00:37:33.25,00:37:33.25,"is it ""As long as it ain't me""? >> I think spending the time"
608,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,that we spend with people out here and getting to know people
609,00:37:39.50,00:37:39.50,"and the level that you do, that your morals and your heart"
610,00:37:42.58,00:37:42.58,definitely come into play a great deal.
611,00:37:45.58,00:37:45.58,It's impossible to block it out if you even have a heart.
612,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,So it definitely comes into play when you are making a decision.
613,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"It does for me. >> PROBST: Okay, before we get"
614,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"to the vote, an immunity idol was hidden at your camp."
615,00:37:58.92,00:37:58.92,"If anybody has found that and you want to use it, now is the"
616,00:38:02.88,00:38:02.88,time to present it. Okay.
617,00:38:07.88,00:38:07.88,Either nobody has found the idol or they just don't want to
618,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,"reveal it at this time. Gary has individual immunity,"
619,00:38:14.46,00:38:14.46,he's the only one you cannot vote for.
620,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
621,00:38:19.25,00:38:19.25,"Judd, you're up. >> I have the utmost respect for"
622,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,you. We bled together and we fought
623,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"together, you are a good man. I'm sorry you had to go."
624,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,>> You talk about having Southern pride.
625,00:38:55.04,00:38:55.04,"Well, part of having Southern pride is being a Southern"
626,00:38:59.00,00:38:59.00,"gentleman. And no, you don't have any class"
627,00:39:01.92,00:39:01.92,at all. >> PROBST: I will go tally the
628,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,votes. >> PROBST: Once the votes are
629,00:39:29.62,00:39:29.62,"read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
630,00:39:31.71,00:39:31.71,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
631,00:39:33.46,00:39:33.46,"I will read the votes. First vote, Brandon."
632,00:39:41.58,00:39:41.58,"Brandon, two votes Brandon. Jamie."
633,00:39:48.96,00:39:48.96,"Two votes Brandon, one vote Jamie."
634,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,"Jamie. Two votes Brandon, two votes"
635,00:39:55.62,00:39:55.62,Jamie. Brandon.
636,00:40:00.96,00:40:00.96,"That's three votes Brandon, two votes Jamie."
637,00:40:07.17,00:40:07.17,Jamie. We're tied three votes each.
638,00:40:13.12,00:40:13.12,"Brandon. That's four votes Brandon,"
639,00:40:15.75,00:40:15.75,three votes Jamie. Jamie.
640,00:40:21.79,00:40:21.79,"Tied again. Four votes Brandon,"
641,00:40:23.67,00:40:23.67,four votes Jamie. Brandon.
642,00:40:28.21,00:40:28.21,"Five votes Brandon, Four votes Jamie."
643,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,One vote left. Ninth person voted out of
644,00:40:41.54,00:40:41.54,"Survivor: Guatemala, Brandon. You need to bring me your torch."
645,00:40:52.21,00:40:52.21,>> You're the sister I never had.
646,00:40:58.67,00:40:58.67,">> PROBST: Brandon, the tribe has spoken."
647,00:41:04.25,00:41:04.25,"Time for you to go. >> Good luck, guys."
648,00:41:15.12,00:41:15.12,">> PROBST: Well, you have made it to the Final Nine."
649,00:41:18.12,00:41:18.12,"Two of you will make it to the Final Two, the other seven will"
650,00:41:21.08,00:41:21.08,"make up the jury. 18 days left, a lot can happen."
651,00:41:25.25,00:41:25.25,"One thing is certain, everything you've done up until now and"
652,00:41:28.17,00:41:28.17,everything you do from here on out matters.
653,00:41:31.54,00:41:31.54,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

666,00:42:16.42,00:42:16.42,"here to play, and I think I played a pretty good game,"
667,00:42:20.21,00:42:20.21,a pretty straight up game. I wasn't always all about the
668,00:42:22.88,00:42:22.88,money. I was playing the game for
669,00:42:24.92,00:42:24.92,myself. You can take me out of this game
670,00:42:27.04,00:42:27.04,before you take my pride. And I think I did a pretty good
671,00:42:29.75,00:42:29.75,job of that. I think I can walk away from
672,00:42:31.58,00:42:31.58,"this and, you know, take something good with me."
