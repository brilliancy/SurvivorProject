20,00:01:05.21,00:01:05.21,...Alex hung on for dear life. Can he pull it off?
21,00:01:08.33,00:01:08.33,But lost his grip at the last moment.

26,00:01:28.54,00:01:28.54,tonight? >> PROBST: But Yau-Man felt
27,00:01:30.33,00:01:30.33,confident. >> We all agree Alex needs to be
28,00:01:33.08,00:01:33.08,"taken out, so I do not think I will need to use my hidden"
29,00:01:35.75,00:01:35.75,immunity idol. >> PROBST: At tribal council...
30,00:01:39.38,00:01:39.38,"First vote, Yau-Man. ...though Yau-Man's name came"
31,00:01:42.08,00:01:42.08,up... 12th person voted out and the
32,00:01:44.29,00:01:44.29,sixth member of our jury. ...the tribe stayed true to its
33,00:01:46.83,00:01:46.83,alliance and voted Alex out of the game.
34,00:01:49.25,00:01:49.25,"Alex, the tribe has spoken. Six are left."
35,00:01:53.67,00:01:53.67,Who will be voted out tonight? >> I'm making a back path to the
36,00:02:26.54,00:02:26.54,water well. Sneaky is fun.

38,00:02:56.33,00:02:56.33,happens? >> ...if we should have a
39,00:03:04.96,00:03:04.96,disagreement or something like that.
40,00:03:06.62,00:03:06.62,>> The plan is actually to get rid of Boo next.
41,00:03:09.12,00:03:09.12,"Now that Alex is gone, Boo is up."
42,00:03:11.12,00:03:11.12,"You know, you want to get rid of the stronger people and people"
43,00:03:12.71,00:03:12.71,you're not sure if you can trust.
44,00:03:14.88,00:03:14.88,So everybody agreed that Boo would be the next person.
45,00:03:17.79,00:03:17.79,>> He's going to go into the challenges really fighting to
46,00:03:21.21,00:03:21.21,win immunity. >> Everybody be careful when

48,00:03:30.46,00:03:30.46,"You can see that. >> At this point, I'm definitely"
49,00:03:33.67,00:03:33.67,having fun. There's a lot more sneaky
50,00:03:35.75,00:03:35.75,"conservation, there's a lot more combinations going in my head to"
51,00:03:38.79,00:03:38.79,"say, you know, ""Who should be the four I should have, and how"
52,00:03:42.21,00:03:42.21,"do I get that?"" Getting rid of Boo first would"
53,00:03:45.29,00:03:45.29,"make my life much, much better. ( theme song playing )"

57,00:05:40.67,00:05:40.67,"Only by using some bold moves will you be good enough."""
58,00:05:44.50,00:05:44.50,">> Holy crap, y'all! You know what that means?"
59,00:05:47.46,00:05:47.46,It's a car. >> I didn't even get my license
60,00:05:55.71,00:05:55.71,"because I didn't have a car, and I feel it'd be a waste of time"
61,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,to just have a license sitting in your pocket and no car.
62,00:06:05.04,00:06:05.04,I just want a car. If we're playing for a car and
63,00:06:10.08,00:06:10.08,it has anything to do with strength or agility or any of

189,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,"Head on back to camp. Dreamz, here's how it's going to"
190,00:14:21.17,00:14:21.17,work. We're going to load your truck
191,00:14:23.17,00:14:23.17,on to our barge. We're going to float you up
192,00:14:25.92,00:14:25.92,river until we can get access to a road.
193,00:14:28.12,00:14:28.12,You're going to drive to the school.
194,00:14:30.29,00:14:30.29,"I'll be waiting for you there. In the meantime, check out your"
195,00:14:32.62,00:14:32.62,new ride. >> Whoo!
196,00:15:02.92,00:15:02.92,">> Well, today is the reward challenge."
197,00:15:05.25,00:15:05.25,"As the winner, I get to pick someone to go to Exile Island."
198,00:15:10.08,00:15:10.08,"Earl has been to Exile Island once too many times, and I don't"
199,00:15:14.17,00:15:14.17,think Cassandra would survive at all.
200,00:15:17.21,00:15:17.21,So I end up electing myself to go to Exile Island.
201,00:15:20.54,00:15:20.54,I think that's the first time that has happened.
202,00:15:24.62,00:15:24.62,I feel very good about giving Dreamz that car.
203,00:15:27.38,00:15:27.38,"Certainly, that is the biggest gift I have given so far in my"
204,00:15:31.04,00:15:31.04,entire life. He has the opportunity to
205,00:15:33.79,00:15:33.79,"really, really change his life, and I am very glad I'm able to"
206,00:15:38.12,00:15:38.12,"do that, even though it's based on a strategic move."
207,00:15:42.96,00:15:42.96,"My worry has been always when I get to the final four, Dreamz"
208,00:15:46.17,00:15:46.17,"will probably be there, and I need a way to get rid of Dreamz."
209,00:15:52.96,00:15:52.96,So I made Dreamz the offer that if and when we get to the final
210,00:15:56.58,00:15:56.58,"four together, that if he wins immunity, he has to give it to"
211,00:16:00.08,00:16:00.08,me. I was very surprised he said yes
212,00:16:05.04,00:16:05.04,without much hesitation. By giving away the truck is the
213,00:16:10.62,00:16:10.62,"best way to get rid of my biggest competitor, and I have"
214,00:16:14.21,00:16:14.21,pretty much guaranteed myself a free pass at the final four.
215,00:16:19.04,00:16:19.04,All right! Electing myself to come to Exile
216,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,Island also gives me the opportunity to get the third
217,00:16:26.96,00:16:26.96,"clue, which would help me find the rehidden immunity idol."
218,00:16:33.38,00:16:33.38,"Clue number three: ""Towards the distant mainland mountains, down"
219,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,"the beach, if you are pining for treasure, it's within your"
220,00:16:42.12,00:16:42.12,"reach."" The third clue pretty much"
221,00:16:46.54,00:16:46.54,pinpoints whether the rehidden immunity idol is located.
222,00:16:50.21,00:16:50.21,I will need to share it with Earl.
223,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,Hopefully one of us will find it.
224,00:17:03.88,00:17:03.88,>> Yau-Man gave me a Ford F-350 2008.
225,00:17:07.58,00:17:07.58,I couldn't believe it. Everything was so nice about the
226,00:17:11.25,00:17:11.25,"truck, and it's all mine. The other part of the reward is"
227,00:17:24.12,00:17:24.12,"to stop by and pick up a trailer with, like, an office in it."
228,00:17:27.71,00:17:27.71,And then we go deliver a whole bunch of school supplies to a
229,00:17:30.17,00:17:30.17,"bunch of kids who really needed the school supplies, you know."
230,00:17:33.33,00:17:33.33,>> I can't wait to see the look on those children's faces.
231,00:17:35.54,00:17:35.54,>> I want to see the kids. >> Me too.
232,00:17:37.21,00:17:37.21,"( horn honking ) >> Come on, guys!"
233,00:17:46.08,00:17:46.08,( cheering ) >> The big part of the reward
234,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,was giving a big box of school supplies to these children and
235,00:17:57.92,00:17:57.92,"these administrators at the school, this very small school."
236,00:18:01.33,00:18:01.33,There was all kinds of stuff in it.
237,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,"There was sporting equipment, school uniforms, jump ropes and"
238,00:18:08.25,00:18:08.25,"soccer balls, footballs. Their faces just lit up."
239,00:18:16.21,00:18:16.21,That was just one of the most amazing experiences I think I've
240,00:18:18.54,00:18:18.54,had in my life. >> PROBST: Now we have something
241,00:18:20.42,00:18:20.42,for the teachers. Come on over.
242,00:18:28.00,00:18:28.00,"Thanks, Boo. >> What we had for the teachers"
243,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,was a mobile teachers' office. ( woman gasping )
244,00:18:35.62,00:18:35.62,">> It had a sofa in there, air conditioning."
245,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,"They had a computer, a copy machine."
246,00:18:41.08,00:18:41.08,They had the best school around now.
247,00:18:43.33,00:18:43.33,>> I think it will help children.
248,00:18:47.25,00:18:47.25,"It will lift the level of achievement that they have, I"
249,00:18:49.96,00:18:49.96,hope. ( laughter )
250,00:18:56.21,00:18:56.21,">> Boo, you blend in over there. >> Dreamz, I'm from the USA,"
251,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,"America, a long ways away. >> I like both of them."
252,00:19:07.08,00:19:07.08,It's warm here. It's real cold over there.
253,00:19:10.54,00:19:10.54,You ever been to America? >> No.
254,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,>> No? This is my first time here.
255,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,It was a day that I'll remember forever.
256,00:19:21.25,00:19:21.25,"When I just got that brand-new truck, it was my next step up."
257,00:19:24.00,00:19:24.00,"And when these kids got this stuff for the classroom, they"
258,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,knew that was their next step up.
259,00:19:28.46,00:19:28.46,"I related to them 100%. But I was thinking, when Yau-Man"
260,00:19:32.21,00:19:32.21,"gave me the car, what did he gain out of that?"
261,00:19:35.54,00:19:35.54,And then I thought about his strategy.
262,00:19:37.38,00:19:37.38,"If I give Yau-Man immunity off my neck, I'm gone."
263,00:19:41.08,00:19:41.08,So the best thing for me to do is to get rid of him before he
264,00:19:44.04,00:19:44.04,makes it to the final four. >> Yeah.
265,00:20:06.92,00:20:06.92,What do you think? >> I guess.
266,00:20:08.71,00:20:08.71,>> Yeah. >> Pure strategy.
267,00:20:12.12,00:20:12.12,That truck was pure strategy. It was a nice thing to do.
268,00:20:15.08,00:20:15.08,It was a real kind thing to do. But the deal that Yau-Man set
269,00:20:18.88,00:20:18.88,"up, he was actually trying to accomplish getting rid of me"
270,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,"without literally saying, ""Let's get rid of Dreamz,"" because he"
271,00:20:24.00,00:20:24.00,"knows that me, Earl, and Cassandra are going to stick"
272,00:20:27.08,00:20:27.08,together and make it to the top three.
273,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,"I ain't going out like that. I mean, not that I'm a snake or"
274,00:20:36.08,00:20:36.08,"nothing, but he let me realize that this is a game, you know"
275,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,what I mean? If we make it to the final four
276,00:20:41.79,00:20:41.79,"and I win immunity, I will give Yau-Man the immunity necklace"
277,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,"because I appreciate what he did for me, and I wouldn't want my"
278,00:20:48.29,00:20:48.29,son to not be a man of his word. That puts me in a bind of either
279,00:20:53.54,00:20:53.54,I got to get Yau-Man out of this game before the final four or
280,00:20:57.38,00:20:57.38,lie and look like a total liar and people not trust me again.
281,00:21:02.79,00:21:02.79,"I know it sounds crazy, but we got to play for us, take Yau-Man"
282,00:21:06.08,00:21:06.08,"out. And if Earl get in the way, we"
283,00:21:08.33,00:21:08.33,"might have to take him out too, but I doubt it."
284,00:21:10.83,00:21:10.83,I want to take Boo out before Earl.
285,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,"I still want to make it me, you, and Earl to be top three."
286,00:21:15.46,00:21:15.46,>> You don't think it's dangerous keeping Boo around
287,00:21:16.83,00:21:16.83,longer? >> No.
288,00:21:21.50,00:21:21.50,"...we have a couple of more times to take out Boo, you know"
289,00:21:23.17,00:21:23.17,what I mean? >> Uh-huh.
290,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,It is tempting to consider getting rid of Yau-Man.
291,00:21:27.92,00:21:27.92,"He's a strong candidate, and I think if he's in the number-one"
292,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,"or two position, he's going to have quite a few of jury's votes"
293,00:21:33.17,00:21:33.17,"on his side. Hey, Boo!"
294,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,"But Boo is a huge threat. I mean, physically he's stronger"
295,00:21:38.46,00:21:38.46,"than Earl. So I think, you know, if he"
296,00:21:41.08,00:21:41.08,"continues with winning immunity, then he's a threat to our entire"
297,00:21:43.62,00:21:43.62,"alliance. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
298,00:22:01.29,00:22:01.29,"We'll now bring in Yau-Man, returning from Exile Island."
299,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,>> Yau-Man! >> Yau.
300,00:22:06.92,00:22:06.92,"( applause ) >> PROBST: Dreamz, since Yau-Man"
301,00:22:09.04,00:22:09.04,"wasn't with you, anything you want to share about how nice"
302,00:22:11.71,00:22:11.71,"that Ford Super Duty rides? >> Thank you, thank you, thank"
303,00:22:15.08,00:22:15.08,you. It was... it was lovely.
304,00:22:17.62,00:22:17.62,>> I'm glad you enjoyed it. Keep enjoying it.
305,00:22:20.33,00:22:20.33,">> I think I will. >> PROBST: Okay, you guys ready"
306,00:22:23.54,00:22:23.54,to get to today's challenge? >> Let's do it.
307,00:22:25.33,00:22:25.33,">> PROBST: First thing's first. Boo, I'll take back the immunity"
308,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,necklace. Thank you.
309,00:22:31.42,00:22:31.42,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
310,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,"For today's challenge, all six of you will start on a platform."
311,00:22:37.88,00:22:37.88,You will each have a ball attached to a long rope.
312,00:22:41.21,00:22:41.21,Your goal is to throw the ball through a hoop and pull down a
313,00:22:45.29,00:22:45.29,"balance beam, which you will then cross to the finish."
314,00:22:49.54,00:22:49.54,"The first four to finish move on to the next round, where we will"
315,00:22:53.00,00:22:53.00,do it again. The first two to finish move on
316,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,"to the final round. For the final round, you will"
317,00:22:58.88,00:22:58.88,once again lower a balance beam. This time when you cross the
318,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,"beam, you will cross to a very small perch, where you will use"
319,00:23:06.08,00:23:06.08,a grappling hook to retrieve a buoy out in the water.
320,00:23:10.12,00:23:10.12,First person to get their buoy wins immunity.
321,00:23:13.12,00:23:13.12,"We'll draw for spots, and we'll get going."
322,00:23:17.92,00:23:17.92,First four to finish move on to the next round.
323,00:23:20.42,00:23:20.42,Survivors ready? Go!
324,00:23:31.08,00:23:31.08,Dreamz having no trouble. He hooks his balance beam and is
325,00:23:33.83,00:23:33.83,lowering it. Dreamz is moving on.
326,00:23:40.12,00:23:40.12,Three more people moving on. Cassandra throws her entire rope
327,00:23:47.08,00:23:47.08,and ball. She's going to have to get in
328,00:23:49.42,00:23:49.42,"and get wet to get it. Yau-Man with a nice toss, just"
329,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,misses. Stacy not close.
330,00:24:01.50,00:24:01.50,"Boo connects, lowering his balance beam."
331,00:24:04.88,00:24:04.88,"Earl connects, lowering his balance beam."
332,00:24:09.08,00:24:09.08,"Boo is across, joining Dreamz. Earl needs to get across that"
333,00:24:12.67,00:24:12.67,beam. He barely makes it.
334,00:24:16.25,00:24:16.25,">> But I did. >> PROBST: Dreamz, Boo, and Earl"
335,00:24:18.12,00:24:18.12,are in the final. We're looking for one more
336,00:24:19.58,00:24:19.58,person. Cassandra taking a long time to
337,00:24:23.62,00:24:23.62,get back to her platform. Yau-Man hooks his hoop.
338,00:24:34.21,00:24:34.21,"Yau-Man, Dreamz, Boo, and Earl moving on to the next round."
339,00:24:40.04,00:24:40.04,First two to finish move on to the final round.
340,00:24:44.75,00:24:44.75,Survivors ready? Go!
341,00:25:07.50,00:25:07.50,Yau-Man loops his. Dreamz just misses.
342,00:25:14.62,00:25:14.62,Yau-Man making his way across the balance beam.
343,00:25:17.50,00:25:17.50,Hangs on. Yau-Man moving on.
344,00:25:23.17,00:25:23.17,Boo lowers his balance beam. Boo's got to get across.
345,00:25:28.25,00:25:28.25,Boo and Yau-Man moving on to the final.
346,00:25:36.46,00:25:36.46,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
347,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,Go! Boo almost falls off his
348,00:25:46.50,00:25:46.50,platform. Yau-Man short.
349,00:25:50.67,00:25:50.67,Boo trying to lean it in. Boo lowers his balance beam.
350,00:25:59.67,00:25:59.67,He's making his way across. Boo now navigating a second
351,00:26:04.71,00:26:04.71,balance beam. Boo is across to the perch.
352,00:26:13.17,00:26:13.17,"Yau-Man, got to keep working. Boo with the grappling hook now"
353,00:26:16.21,00:26:16.21,has to retrieve the buoy. That might do it.
354,00:26:23.67,00:26:23.67,Getting closer and closer. Boo wins immunity!
355,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,"Boo, come back over. Boo once again safe at tribal"
356,00:26:44.79,00:26:44.79,"council. Dreamz, Stacy, Cassandra, Yau-"
357,00:26:47.38,00:26:47.38,"Man, Earl, one of you going home at the next tribal council."
358,00:26:50.58,00:26:50.58,Head on back to camp. >> I might go get some wood.
359,00:27:16.12,00:27:16.12,">> Boo, boo. >> I'm extremely stoked to win"
360,00:27:25.62,00:27:25.62,immunity this time. I think I noticed
361,00:27:28.92,00:27:28.92,"disappointment, people talking like ""Okay, plan B"" after I won"
362,00:27:33.71,00:27:33.71,immunity. So I'm not sure if that's the
363,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,"case, but I was extremely happy that I won."
364,00:27:41.88,00:27:41.88,>> I was wondering how you were doing over there on Exile.
365,00:27:44.00,00:27:44.00,>> Good. I did manage to stay dry.
366,00:27:51.46,00:27:51.46,">> When I came back to camp, I had all three clues."
367,00:27:54.58,00:27:54.58,The third one pretty much pinpoints where the rehidden
368,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,"immunity idol is located. As promised, I shared it with"
369,00:28:01.58,00:28:01.58,Earl. ...and it's quotes...
370,00:28:09.12,00:28:09.12,>> It's a pine tree. And it's hollow.
371,00:28:11.79,00:28:11.79,>> It's hollow. So it's inside the hollow of a
372,00:28:13.88,00:28:13.88,pine tree. >> Okay.
373,00:28:16.08,00:28:16.08,Inside the hollow of the pine tree.
374,00:28:18.33,00:28:18.33,I'll be able to find it. Yau-Man came back from Exile
375,00:28:21.25,00:28:21.25,Island with news. So we're just hoping to find
376,00:28:25.62,00:28:25.62,"that other hidden immunity idol, and then Yau will have one, and"
377,00:28:28.46,00:28:28.46,I will have one. The first clue told me that it
378,00:28:34.08,00:28:34.08,was in a tree and easy to reach. The second clue told me that it
379,00:28:42.42,00:28:42.42,was near a tower of rock. How do I get up there?
380,00:29:00.71,00:29:00.71,"And then, when I got the third clue that it was a pine tree and"
381,00:29:06.46,00:29:06.46,"the hollow of a pine tree, that's what did it."
382,00:29:09.21,00:29:09.21,So I started looking at pine trees.
383,00:29:16.29,00:29:16.29,Oh! ( laughing )
384,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,"Well, well, well. There you go."
385,00:29:32.79,00:29:32.79,"We are in business. Yau and myself, we trust each"
386,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,"other 100%, and that's why we are where we are now."
387,00:29:53.88,00:29:53.88,"We have two idols, man. Just think, we used to share an"
388,00:29:56.12,00:29:56.12,"idol, and now, go figure, we both have our own immunity idol."
389,00:30:07.42,00:30:07.42,"( laughter ) >> No, it was kind of hard."
390,00:30:11.96,00:30:11.96,It was... it was a lot of pine trees.
391,00:30:15.92,00:30:15.92,>> You were gone a long time. I was getting worried.
392,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,">> Yeah, I mean, I had... >> I was hoping Boo didn't wake"
393,00:30:20.75,00:30:20.75,"up and ask me where you went. Well, at this point, Earl and I"
394,00:30:24.50,00:30:24.50,each have our own hidden immunity idol.
395,00:30:28.29,00:30:28.29,"With that, we will certainly guarantee our place at the final"
396,00:30:31.42,00:30:31.42,"four, and with my deal I made with Dreamz, I will guarantee"
397,00:30:34.67,00:30:34.67,myself a place in the final three.
398,00:30:48.75,00:30:48.75,">> This is the deal. Yau's pretty smart, okay?"
399,00:30:53.58,00:30:53.58,"As you know, he wants me, him, Earl, and Cassandra, which"
400,00:30:59.04,00:30:59.04,knocks you out of the top four. You get what I'm saying?
401,00:31:02.17,00:31:02.17,And that's not what I want to do.
402,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,"I want to get rid of Yau today. We get rid of Yau today, you'll"
403,00:31:08.29,00:31:08.29,be back in the top four. You get what I'm saying?
404,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,"You feeling me on this? Yau has the immunity idol, so"
405,00:31:14.08,00:31:14.08,he's going to use it in the top five.
406,00:31:16.17,00:31:16.17,And then I give him my idol in the top four.
407,00:31:19.29,00:31:19.29,So that puts him two spots up. >> I was a little concerned that
408,00:31:22.92,00:31:22.92,"I would be next today, but Dreamz came up with another"
409,00:31:26.04,00:31:26.04,idea. He said if he wins immunity when
410,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,"there's four people left, he would give it to Yau-Man if Yau-"
411,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,Man was still in the game. So if Yau-Man is not in the
412,00:31:35.25,00:31:35.25,"game, then, really, Dreamz didn't go against him, you know,"
413,00:31:39.79,00:31:39.79,in that deal. So how many votes will be going
414,00:31:43.08,00:31:43.08,to Yau-Man? >> Just you and me right now.
415,00:31:47.75,00:31:47.75,">> Hey. >> Cassandra, any plan that I"
416,00:31:52.33,00:31:52.33,planned hasn't worked out so far.
417,00:31:54.54,00:31:54.54,"Nothing that I planned worked so far, because we always switched"
418,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,"it at the last minute, you know, but we got to take Yau out."
419,00:32:00.75,00:32:00.75,"If you ever want to help me, now is the time."
420,00:32:06.12,00:32:06.12,>> Uh-huh. >> I'm with Dreamz's plan.
421,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,I'm willing to do it. >> Okay.
422,00:32:09.83,00:32:09.83,">> Are going to help me? >> Yeah, I'm with the plan."
423,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,"Yeah, I'm with you. >> Are you going to help us?"
424,00:32:12.38,00:32:12.38,>> Uh-huh. >> Tonight's vote will be Yau-
425,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,Man. >> So he won't even know what
426,00:32:16.08,00:32:16.08,hit him. Make him think that Stacy's
427,00:32:18.08,00:32:18.08,going. >> Yep.
428,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,">> Okay, all right. There's definitely a risk"
429,00:32:23.88,00:32:23.88,involved in voting Yau-Man. The pros about it is that
430,00:32:27.42,00:32:27.42,"looking down the line, if Yau- Man is still in the game and he"
431,00:32:29.96,00:32:29.96,"makes it to one and two position, that he'd be a"
432,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,"difficult competitor to beat. The con is, though, that if he"
433,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,"uses the immunity, that I will have burned two bridges, one"
434,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,"with Earl and one with Yau-Man, and they're two valuable"
435,00:32:43.08,00:32:43.08,bridges. >> Can we talk to you for a
436,00:32:47.75,00:32:47.75,"minute? >> I mean, the key right now is"
437,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,getting Yau-Man and Earl to believe that they don't need to
438,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,use the immunity idol at this point.
439,00:33:02.67,00:33:02.67,">> I don't think any of us did, but I don't have any hard"
440,00:33:05.21,00:33:05.21,"feelings, you know. Like, at this point, if Boo"
441,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,"didn't get immunity, it would be smarter to remove him at this"
442,00:33:10.83,00:33:10.83,point. It's just who is the smarter
443,00:33:12.67,00:33:12.67,person to remove at which time? That's all.
444,00:33:15.50,00:33:15.50,>> Kudos to Boo. He saves himself.
445,00:33:17.67,00:33:17.67,"So by default, it's Stacy. Stacy already realized that"
446,00:33:22.38,00:33:22.38,possibility and accepts her fate and is going down with dignity.
447,00:33:26.42,00:33:26.42,She knows it's her time. >> I can't do anything about the
448,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,"numbers, you know? Like, I cannot."
449,00:33:32.25,00:33:32.25,"My hands are tied. If I could, I would, but I"
450,00:33:33.92,00:33:33.92,can't. >> I like that.
451,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,"I mean, I really, really respect that."
452,00:33:45.21,00:33:45.21,>> Yeah. >> I know.
453,00:33:51.25,00:33:51.25,"At this point, you know, while we're all planning to vote Stacy"
454,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,"out, I am still very much in tune with what's going on around"
455,00:33:59.12,00:33:59.12,me. >> Yau?
456,00:34:07.25,00:34:07.25,">> Oh, please. I had to make the best deal I"
457,00:34:09.12,00:34:09.12,can with it. Thanks for making the deal.
458,00:34:11.58,00:34:11.58,">> Look, I'm not dumb, Yau. >> No."
459,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,">> I'm not dumb, I'm saying. >> No."
460,00:34:17.04,00:34:17.04,">> I know your strategy is to take me out at three, and it's a"
461,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"good strategy. >> At this point, I'm quite sure"
462,00:34:24.38,00:34:24.38,that people like Dreamz certainly see me as a threat.
463,00:34:27.46,00:34:27.46,"So far, in my conversation with everybody, it seems to be still"
464,00:34:30.12,00:34:30.12,"all right. But on the other hand, I will"
465,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,never be 100% sure. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
466,00:35:19.79,00:35:19.79,"the members of the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,"
467,00:35:27.96,00:35:27.96,"and Alex, voted out at the last tribal council."
468,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"All right, at the reward challenge, you were all playing"
469,00:35:36.38,00:35:36.38,for a truck. Yau-Man wins the truck and
470,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,"immediately begins a negotiation with you, Dreamz."
471,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,"Tell me how that went down. >> After Yau-Man won the truck,"
472,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,he wanted to make an agreement. He said if I make it to the
473,00:35:51.79,00:35:51.79,"final four, and he's still there, and I win immunity, to"
474,00:35:55.25,00:35:55.25,"give it to him. And I was like, ""Deal!"""
475,00:36:00.00,00:36:00.00,"You know, that's nothing to me. So he gave me the truck."
476,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,I'm a great man of my word. I owe Yau-Man to get the
477,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,"immunity at final four, and I'm going to see to it that I do get"
478,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"it at final four. >> PROBST: So, Yau-Man, what do"
479,00:36:12.08,00:36:12.08,you expect from Dreamz in that negotiation?
480,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,>> I expect Dreamz to live up to his word.
481,00:36:18.42,00:36:18.42,It's a risk that he will renege on it.
482,00:36:20.54,00:36:20.54,Certainly the bigger risk is that the next two rounds there's
483,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,"a big target on my back, so I don't make it to the final four."
484,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,But I thought it's worth that risk.
485,00:36:29.29,00:36:29.29,"The other part also is Dreamz needs the car, and that's my big"
486,00:36:33.21,00:36:33.21,"heart, let him have the car. >> PROBST: Let's talk about the"
487,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,"hidden immunity idol. It's come out that Yau-Man, at"
488,00:36:39.71,00:36:39.71,"least at one point, had it. Who knows who has it now?"
489,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,"Boo, you worried? >> It doesn't matter to me who"
490,00:36:45.67,00:36:45.67,"has it at this point. >> PROBST: Cassandra, do you"
491,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,"believe that? >> No, it definitely matters who"
492,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,"has the idol. I mean, the idol can be used in"
493,00:36:54.33,00:36:54.33,the next two tribal councils. And I think that's critical to
494,00:36:56.83,00:36:56.83,"the game, who has the idol. >> PROBST: Million-dollar"
495,00:37:00.79,00:37:00.79,"blunder, Earl, if you have the idol and don't play it and get"
496,00:37:03.42,00:37:03.42,voted out. >> You definitely have to gauge
497,00:37:06.00,00:37:06.00,"when you're going to need it. We're in the top six, so every"
498,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,"single time we come here, you're a target."
499,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,There's no guarantees for anything.
500,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,"And now we got to start eating each other, so that's when you"
501,00:37:15.42,00:37:15.42,"really start to worry. >> PROBST: Stacy, how scared are"
502,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,you tonight that it's you? >> I'm worried just because I'm
503,00:37:24.38,00:37:24.38,"a late-comer in this alliance, and I think that before they"
504,00:37:28.21,00:37:28.21,"cannibalize each other, they may want to try to get me out."
505,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,But I guess I'll find out tonight.
506,00:37:34.25,00:37:34.25,">> PROBST: Dreamz, how about you?"
507,00:37:35.83,00:37:35.83,">> I'm definitely worried, because me saying that I'll give"
508,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"him the immunity idol at four, people be like, ""Oh, I can't let"
509,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,"him get to four."" I mean, so I would think Yau-Man"
510,00:37:43.12,00:37:43.12,"would try to protect me a little bit until four, but you can"
511,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,"never tell. You know, we haven't talked"
512,00:37:47.29,00:37:47.29,"about it. >> PROBST: Stacy, what do you"
513,00:37:49.88,00:37:49.88,think will be the result from tonight's vote?
514,00:37:52.12,00:37:52.12,>> I think that everyone wants to seem like they're playing
515,00:37:54.29,00:37:54.29,"nice, but I think that there's going to be lines drawn and"
516,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,"there's going to be division amongst the tight-knit alliance,"
517,00:38:00.71,00:38:00.71,because I don't think that it's all going to be a vote one way
518,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,or the other. I think it's going to be split.
519,00:38:11.75,00:38:11.75,">> PROBST: Well, there's obviously a lot of uneasiness"
520,00:38:14.38,00:38:14.38,surrounding this vote tonight. If you have the idol and you
521,00:38:17.08,00:38:17.08,"need to play it, you would present it to me before I read"
522,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,the votes. Boo has individual immunity.
523,00:38:22.29,00:38:22.29,You can't vote for him. Everybody else is fair game.
524,00:38:25.46,00:38:25.46,"It's time to vote. Earl, you're up."
525,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,">> Good-bye, Stacy. Sorry, it's your turn."
526,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"Good luck. >> Sorry, bro, that's how the"
527,00:38:58.75,00:38:58.75,game goes. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
528,00:39:09.17,00:39:09.17,votes. If anybody has the hidden
529,00:39:24.21,00:39:24.21,"immunity idol and feels they need to play it, now is the time"
530,00:39:26.38,00:39:26.38,to do so. Yau-Man is playing the hidden
531,00:39:53.21,00:39:53.21,immunity idol. Yau-Man's immune from tonight's
532,00:39:57.79,00:39:57.79,vote. Any votes cast for Yau-Man do
533,00:40:01.08,00:40:01.08,not count. I'll read the votes.
534,00:40:08.04,00:40:08.04,"First vote, Stacy. Yau-Man."
535,00:40:15.67,00:40:15.67,That vote does not count. One vote Stacy.
536,00:40:21.21,00:40:21.21,Stacy. Two votes Stacy.
537,00:40:27.17,00:40:27.17,Yau-Man. That vote does not count.
538,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"Stacy, you have two votes. There are two votes left."
539,00:40:33.62,00:40:33.62,The best you can hope for is a tie with another person.
540,00:40:38.00,00:40:38.00,"Which means if this next vote is for Yau-Man, you're going home."
541,00:40:47.38,00:40:47.38,It's Yau-Man. 13th person voted out and the
542,00:40:50.17,00:40:50.17,"seventh member of our jury, Stacy."
543,00:41:00.83,00:41:00.83,"Stacy, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
544,00:41:18.58,00:41:18.58,"Well, there's still the possibility that yet another"
545,00:41:21.04,00:41:21.04,hidden immunity idol might come into play.
546,00:41:24.38,00:41:24.38,The last time you can use it is at the next tribal council.
547,00:41:28.21,00:41:28.21,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
548,00:41:30.12,00:41:30.12,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
549,00:41:45.50,00:41:45.50,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
550,00:41:50.79,00:41:50.79,"Survivor, will Dreamz make it to the final four and win"
551,00:41:54.25,00:41:54.25,immunity? >> My fate was sealed when I
552,00:41:56.71,00:41:56.71,"took the truck. >> PROBST: And if so, will he"
