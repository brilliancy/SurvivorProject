189,00:14:21.17,00:14:21.17,work.We're going to load your truck
190,00:14:23.17,00:14:23.17,on to our barge.We're going to float you up
191,00:14:25.92,00:14:25.92,river until we can get access toa road.
192,00:14:28.12,00:14:28.12,You're going to drive to theschool.
193,00:14:30.29,00:14:30.29,"I'll be waiting for you there.In the meantime, check out your"
194,00:14:32.62,00:14:32.62,new ride.>> Whoo!
195,00:15:02.92,00:15:02.92,">> Well, today is the rewardchallenge."
196,00:15:05.25,00:15:05.25,"As the winner, I get to picksomeone to go to Exile Island."
197,00:15:10.08,00:15:10.08,"Earl has been to Exile Islandonce too many times, and I don't"
198,00:15:14.17,00:15:14.17,think Cassandra would survive atall.
199,00:15:17.21,00:15:17.21,So I end up electing myself togo to Exile Island.
200,00:15:20.54,00:15:20.54,I think that's the first timethat has happened.
201,00:15:24.62,00:15:24.62,I feel very good about givingDreamz that car.
202,00:15:27.38,00:15:27.38,"Certainly, that is the biggestgift I have given so far in my"
203,00:15:31.04,00:15:31.04,entire life.He has the opportunity to
204,00:15:33.79,00:15:33.79,"really, really change his life,and I am very glad I'm able to"
205,00:15:38.12,00:15:38.12,"do that, even though it's basedon a strategic move."
206,00:15:42.96,00:15:42.96,"My worry has been always when Iget to the final four, Dreamz"
207,00:15:46.17,00:15:46.17,"will probably be there, and Ineed a way to get rid of Dreamz."
208,00:15:52.96,00:15:52.96,So I made Dreamz the offer thatif and when we get to the final
209,00:15:56.58,00:15:56.58,"four together, that if he winsimmunity, he has to give it to"
210,00:16:00.08,00:16:00.08,me.I was very surprised he said yes
211,00:16:05.04,00:16:05.04,without much hesitation.By giving away the truck is the
212,00:16:10.62,00:16:10.62,"best way to get rid of mybiggest competitor, and I have"
213,00:16:14.21,00:16:14.21,pretty much guaranteed myself afree pass at the final four.
214,00:16:19.04,00:16:19.04,All right!Electing myself to come to Exile
215,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,Island also gives me theopportunity to get the third
216,00:16:26.96,00:16:26.96,"clue, which would help me findthe rehidden immunity idol."
217,00:16:33.38,00:16:33.38,"Clue number three: ""Towards thedistant mainland mountains, down"
218,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,"the beach, if you are pining fortreasure, it's within your"
219,00:16:42.12,00:16:42.12,"reach.""The third clue pretty much"
220,00:16:46.54,00:16:46.54,pinpoints whether the rehiddenimmunity idol is located.
221,00:16:50.21,00:16:50.21,I will need to share it withEarl.
222,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,Hopefully one of us will findit.
223,00:17:03.88,00:17:03.88,>> Yau-Man gave me a Ford F-3502008.
224,00:17:07.58,00:17:07.58,I couldn't believe it.Everything was so nice about the
225,00:17:11.25,00:17:11.25,"truck, and it's all mine.The other part of the reward is"
226,00:17:24.12,00:17:24.12,"to stop by and pick up a trailerwith, like, an office in it."
227,00:17:27.71,00:17:27.71,And then we go deliver a wholebunch of school supplies to a
228,00:17:30.17,00:17:30.17,"bunch of kids who really neededthe school supplies, you know."
229,00:17:33.33,00:17:33.33,>> I can't wait to see the lookon those children's faces.
230,00:17:35.54,00:17:35.54,>> I want to see the kids.>> Me too.
231,00:17:37.21,00:17:37.21,"( horn honking )>> Come on, guys!"
232,00:17:46.08,00:17:46.08,( cheering )>> The big part of the reward
233,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,was giving a big box of schoolsupplies to these children and
234,00:17:57.92,00:17:57.92,"these administrators at theschool, this very small school."
235,00:18:01.33,00:18:01.33,There was all kinds of stuff init.
236,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,"There was sporting equipment,school uniforms, jump ropes and"
237,00:18:08.25,00:18:08.25,"soccer balls, footballs.Their faces just lit up."
238,00:18:16.21,00:18:16.21,That was just one of the mostamazing experiences I think I've
239,00:18:18.54,00:18:18.54,had in my life.>> PROBST: Now we have something
240,00:18:20.42,00:18:20.42,for the teachers.Come on over.
241,00:18:28.00,00:18:28.00,"Thanks, Boo.>> What we had for the teachers"
242,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,was a mobile teachers' office.( woman gasping )
243,00:18:35.62,00:18:35.62,">> It had a sofa in there, airconditioning."
244,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,"They had a computer, a copymachine."
245,00:18:41.08,00:18:41.08,They had the best school aroundnow.
246,00:18:43.33,00:18:43.33,>> I think it will helpchildren.
247,00:18:47.25,00:18:47.25,"It will lift the level ofachievement that they have, I"
248,00:18:49.96,00:18:49.96,hope.( laughter )
249,00:18:56.21,00:18:56.21,">> Boo, you blend in over there.>> Dreamz, I'm from the USA,"
250,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,"America, a long ways away.>> I like both of them."
251,00:19:07.08,00:19:07.08,It's warm here.It's real cold over there.
252,00:19:10.54,00:19:10.54,You ever been to America?>> No.
253,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,>> No?This is my first time here.
254,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,It was a day that I'll rememberforever.
255,00:19:21.25,00:19:21.25,"When I just got that brand-newtruck, it was my next step up."
256,00:19:24.00,00:19:24.00,"And when these kids got thisstuff for the classroom, they"
257,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,knew that was their next stepup.
258,00:19:28.46,00:19:28.46,"I related to them 100%.But I was thinking, when Yau-Man"
259,00:19:32.21,00:19:32.21,"gave me the car, what did hegain out of that?"
260,00:19:35.54,00:19:35.54,And then I thought about hisstrategy.
261,00:19:37.38,00:19:37.38,"If I give Yau-Man immunity offmy neck, I'm gone."
262,00:19:41.08,00:19:41.08,So the best thing for me to dois to get rid of him before he
263,00:19:44.04,00:19:44.04,makes it to the final four.>> Yeah.
264,00:20:06.92,00:20:06.92,What do you think?>> I guess.
265,00:20:08.71,00:20:08.71,>> Yeah.>> Pure strategy.
266,00:20:12.12,00:20:12.12,That truck was pure strategy.It was a nice thing to do.
267,00:20:15.08,00:20:15.08,It was a real kind thing to do.But the deal that Yau-Man set
268,00:20:18.88,00:20:18.88,"up, he was actually trying toaccomplish getting rid of me"
269,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,"without literally saying, ""Let'sget rid of Dreamz,"" because he"
270,00:20:24.00,00:20:24.00,"knows that me, Earl, andCassandra are going to stick"
271,00:20:27.08,00:20:27.08,together and make it to the topthree.
272,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,"I ain't going out like that.I mean, not that I'm a snake or"
273,00:20:36.08,00:20:36.08,"nothing, but he let me realizethat this is a game, you know"
274,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,what I mean?If we make it to the final four
275,00:20:41.79,00:20:41.79,"and I win immunity, I will giveYau-Man the immunity necklace"
276,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,"because I appreciate what he didfor me, and I wouldn't want my"
277,00:20:48.29,00:20:48.29,son to not be a man of his word.That puts me in a bind of either
278,00:20:53.54,00:20:53.54,I got to get Yau-Man out of thisgame before the final four or
279,00:20:57.38,00:20:57.38,lie and look like a total liarand people not trust me again.
280,00:21:02.79,00:21:02.79,"I know it sounds crazy, but wegot to play for us, take Yau-Man"
281,00:21:06.08,00:21:06.08,"out.And if Earl get in the way, we"
282,00:21:08.33,00:21:08.33,"might have to take him out too,but I doubt it."
283,00:21:10.83,00:21:10.83,I want to take Boo out beforeEarl.
284,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,"I still want to make it me, you,and Earl to be top three."
285,00:21:15.46,00:21:15.46,>> You don't think it'sdangerous keeping Boo around
286,00:21:16.83,00:21:16.83,longer?>> No.
287,00:21:21.50,00:21:21.50,"...we have a couple of moretimes to take out Boo, you know"
288,00:21:23.17,00:21:23.17,what I mean?>> Uh-huh.
289,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,It is tempting to considergetting rid of Yau-Man.
290,00:21:27.92,00:21:27.92,"He's a strong candidate, and Ithink if he's in the number-one"
291,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,"or two position, he's going tohave quite a few of jury's votes"
292,00:21:33.17,00:21:33.17,"on his side.Hey, Boo!"
293,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,"But Boo is a huge threat.I mean, physically he's stronger"
294,00:21:38.46,00:21:38.46,"than Earl.So I think, you know, if he"
295,00:21:41.08,00:21:41.08,"continues with winning immunity,then he's a threat to our entire"
296,00:21:43.62,00:21:43.62,"alliance.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
297,00:22:01.29,00:22:01.29,"We'll now bring in Yau-Man,returning from Exile Island."
298,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,>> Yau-Man!>> Yau.
299,00:22:06.92,00:22:06.92,"( applause )>> PROBST: Dreamz, since Yau-Man"
300,00:22:09.04,00:22:09.04,"wasn't with you, anything youwant to share about how nice"
301,00:22:11.71,00:22:11.71,"that Ford Super Duty rides?>> Thank you, thank you, thank"
302,00:22:15.08,00:22:15.08,you.It was... it was lovely.
303,00:22:17.62,00:22:17.62,>> I'm glad you enjoyed it.Keep enjoying it.
304,00:22:20.33,00:22:20.33,">> I think I will.>> PROBST: Okay, you guys ready"
305,00:22:23.54,00:22:23.54,to get to today's challenge?>> Let's do it.
306,00:22:25.33,00:22:25.33,">> PROBST: First thing's first.Boo, I'll take back the immunity"
307,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,necklace.Thank you.
308,00:22:31.42,00:22:31.42,"Once again, immunity is back upfor grabs."
309,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,"For today's challenge, all sixof you will start on a platform."
310,00:22:37.88,00:22:37.88,You will each have a ballattached to a long rope.
311,00:22:41.21,00:22:41.21,Your goal is to throw the ballthrough a hoop and pull down a
312,00:22:45.29,00:22:45.29,"balance beam, which you willthen cross to the finish."
313,00:22:49.54,00:22:49.54,"The first four to finish move onto the next round, where we will"

316,00:22:58.88,00:22:58.88,once again lower a balance beam.This time when you cross the
317,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,"beam, you will cross to a verysmall perch, where you will use"
318,00:23:06.08,00:23:06.08,a grappling hook to retrieve abuoy out in the water.
319,00:23:10.12,00:23:10.12,First person to get their buoywins immunity.
320,00:23:13.12,00:23:13.12,"We'll draw for spots, and we'llget going."

325,00:23:40.12,00:23:40.12,Three more people moving on.Cassandra throws her entire rope
326,00:23:47.08,00:23:47.08,and ball.She's going to have to get in

328,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,misses.Stacy not close.

346,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,Go!Boo almost falls off his

351,00:26:13.17,00:26:13.17,"Yau-Man, got to keep working.Boo with the grappling hook now"
352,00:26:16.21,00:26:16.21,has to retrieve the buoy.That might do it.
353,00:26:23.67,00:26:23.67,Getting closer and closer.Boo wins immunity!
354,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,"Boo, come back over.Boo once again safe at tribal"

357,00:26:50.58,00:26:50.58,Head on back to camp.>> I might go get some wood.
358,00:27:16.12,00:27:16.12,">> Boo, boo.>> I'm extremely stoked to win"
359,00:27:25.62,00:27:25.62,immunity this time.I think I noticed
360,00:27:28.92,00:27:28.92,"disappointment, people talkinglike ""Okay, plan B"" after I won"
361,00:27:33.71,00:27:33.71,immunity.So I'm not sure if that's the
362,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,"case, but I was extremely happythat I won."
363,00:27:41.88,00:27:41.88,>> I was wondering how you weredoing over there on Exile.
364,00:27:44.00,00:27:44.00,>> Good.I did manage to stay dry.
365,00:27:51.46,00:27:51.46,">> When I came back to camp, Ihad all three clues."
366,00:27:54.58,00:27:54.58,The third one pretty muchpinpoints where the rehidden
367,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,"immunity idol is located.As promised, I shared it with"
368,00:28:01.58,00:28:01.58,Earl....and it's quotes...
369,00:28:09.12,00:28:09.12,>> It's a pine tree.And it's hollow.
370,00:28:11.79,00:28:11.79,>> It's hollow.So it's inside the hollow of a
371,00:28:13.88,00:28:13.88,pine tree.>> Okay.
372,00:28:16.08,00:28:16.08,Inside the hollow of the pinetree.
373,00:28:18.33,00:28:18.33,I'll be able to find it.Yau-Man came back from Exile
374,00:28:21.25,00:28:21.25,Island with news.So we're just hoping to find
375,00:28:25.62,00:28:25.62,"that other hidden immunity idol,and then Yau will have one, and"
376,00:28:28.46,00:28:28.46,I will have one.The first clue told me that it
377,00:28:34.08,00:28:34.08,was in a tree and easy to reach.The second clue told me that it
378,00:28:42.42,00:28:42.42,was near a tower of rock.How do I get up there?
379,00:29:00.71,00:29:00.71,"And then, when I got the thirdclue that it was a pine tree and"
380,00:29:06.46,00:29:06.46,"the hollow of a pine tree,that's what did it."
381,00:29:09.21,00:29:09.21,So I started looking at pinetrees.
382,00:29:16.29,00:29:16.29,Oh!( laughing )
383,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,"Well, well, well.There you go."
384,00:29:32.79,00:29:32.79,"We are in business.Yau and myself, we trust each"
385,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,"other 100%, and that's why weare where we are now."
386,00:29:53.88,00:29:53.88,"We have two idols, man.Just think, we used to share an"
387,00:29:56.12,00:29:56.12,"idol, and now, go figure, weboth have our own immunity idol."
388,00:30:07.42,00:30:07.42,"( laughter )>> No, it was kind of hard."
389,00:30:11.96,00:30:11.96,It was... it was a lot of pinetrees.
390,00:30:15.92,00:30:15.92,>> You were gone a long time.I was getting worried.
391,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,">> Yeah, I mean, I had...>> I was hoping Boo didn't wake"
392,00:30:20.75,00:30:20.75,"up and ask me where you went.Well, at this point, Earl and I"
393,00:30:24.50,00:30:24.50,each have our own hiddenimmunity idol.
394,00:30:28.29,00:30:28.29,"With that, we will certainlyguarantee our place at the final"
395,00:30:31.42,00:30:31.42,"four, and with my deal I madewith Dreamz, I will guarantee"
396,00:30:34.67,00:30:34.67,myself a place in the finalthree.
397,00:30:48.75,00:30:48.75,">> This is the deal.Yau's pretty smart, okay?"
398,00:30:53.58,00:30:53.58,"As you know, he wants me, him,Earl, and Cassandra, which"
399,00:30:59.04,00:30:59.04,knocks you out of the top four.You get what I'm saying?
400,00:31:02.17,00:31:02.17,And that's not what I want todo.
401,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,"I want to get rid of Yau today.We get rid of Yau today, you'll"
402,00:31:08.29,00:31:08.29,be back in the top four.You get what I'm saying?
403,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,"You feeling me on this?Yau has the immunity idol, so"
404,00:31:14.08,00:31:14.08,he's going to use it in the topfive.
405,00:31:16.17,00:31:16.17,And then I give him my idol inthe top four.
406,00:31:19.29,00:31:19.29,So that puts him two spots up.>> I was a little concerned that
407,00:31:22.92,00:31:22.92,"I would be next today, butDreamz came up with another"
408,00:31:26.04,00:31:26.04,idea.He said if he wins immunity when
409,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,"there's four people left, hewould give it to Yau-Man if Yau-"
410,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,Man was still in the game.So if Yau-Man is not in the
411,00:31:35.25,00:31:35.25,"game, then, really, Dreamzdidn't go against him, you know,"
412,00:31:39.79,00:31:39.79,in that deal.So how many votes will be going
413,00:31:43.08,00:31:43.08,to Yau-Man?>> Just you and me right now.
414,00:31:47.75,00:31:47.75,">> Hey.>> Cassandra, any plan that I"
415,00:31:52.33,00:31:52.33,planned hasn't worked out sofar.
416,00:31:54.54,00:31:54.54,"Nothing that I planned worked sofar, because we always switched"
417,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,"it at the last minute, you know,but we got to take Yau out."
418,00:32:00.75,00:32:00.75,"If you ever want to help me, nowis the time."
419,00:32:06.12,00:32:06.12,>> Uh-huh.>> I'm with Dreamz's plan.
420,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,I'm willing to do it.>> Okay.
421,00:32:09.83,00:32:09.83,">> Are going to help me?>> Yeah, I'm with the plan."
422,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,"Yeah, I'm with you.>> Are you going to help us?"
423,00:32:12.38,00:32:12.38,>> Uh-huh.>> Tonight's vote will be Yau-
424,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,Man.>> So he won't even know what
425,00:32:16.08,00:32:16.08,hit him.Make him think that Stacy's
426,00:32:18.08,00:32:18.08,going.>> Yep.
427,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,">> Okay, all right.There's definitely a risk"
428,00:32:23.88,00:32:23.88,involved in voting Yau-Man.The pros about it is that
429,00:32:27.42,00:32:27.42,"looking down the line, if Yau-Man is still in the game and he"
430,00:32:29.96,00:32:29.96,"makes it to one and twoposition, that he'd be a"
431,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,"difficult competitor to beat.The con is, though, that if he"
432,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,"uses the immunity, that I willhave burned two bridges, one"
433,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,"with Earl and one with Yau-Man,and they're two valuable"
434,00:32:43.08,00:32:43.08,bridges.>> Can we talk to you for a
435,00:32:47.75,00:32:47.75,"minute?>> I mean, the key right now is"
436,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,getting Yau-Man and Earl tobelieve that they don't need to
437,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,use the immunity idol at thispoint.
438,00:33:02.67,00:33:02.67,">> I don't think any of us did,but I don't have any hard"
439,00:33:05.21,00:33:05.21,"feelings, you know.Like, at this point, if Boo"
440,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,"didn't get immunity, it would besmarter to remove him at this"
441,00:33:10.83,00:33:10.83,point.It's just who is the smarter
442,00:33:12.67,00:33:12.67,person to remove at which time?That's all.
443,00:33:15.50,00:33:15.50,>> Kudos to Boo.He saves himself.
444,00:33:17.67,00:33:17.67,"So by default, it's Stacy.Stacy already realized that"
445,00:33:22.38,00:33:22.38,possibility and accepts her fateand is going down with dignity.
446,00:33:26.42,00:33:26.42,She knows it's her time.>> I can't do anything about the
447,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,"numbers, you know?Like, I cannot."
448,00:33:32.25,00:33:32.25,"My hands are tied.If I could, I would, but I"
449,00:33:33.92,00:33:33.92,can't.>> I like that.
450,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,"I mean, I really, really respectthat."
451,00:33:45.21,00:33:45.21,>> Yeah.>> I know.
452,00:33:51.25,00:33:51.25,"At this point, you know, whilewe're all planning to vote Stacy"
453,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,"out, I am still very much intune with what's going on around"
454,00:33:59.12,00:33:59.12,me.>> Yau?
455,00:34:07.25,00:34:07.25,">> Oh, please.I had to make the best deal I"
456,00:34:09.12,00:34:09.12,can with it.Thanks for making the deal.
457,00:34:11.58,00:34:11.58,">> Look, I'm not dumb, Yau.>> No."
458,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,">> I'm not dumb, I'm saying.>> No."
459,00:34:17.04,00:34:17.04,">> I know your strategy is totake me out at three, and it's a"
460,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"good strategy.>> At this point, I'm quite sure"
461,00:34:24.38,00:34:24.38,that people like Dreamzcertainly see me as a threat.
462,00:34:27.46,00:34:27.46,"So far, in my conversation witheverybody, it seems to be still"
463,00:34:30.12,00:34:30.12,"all right.But on the other hand, I will"
464,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,never be 100% sure.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
465,00:35:19.79,00:35:19.79,"the members of the jury: Rocky,Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,"
466,00:35:27.96,00:35:27.96,"and Alex, voted out at the lasttribal council."
467,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"All right, at the rewardchallenge, you were all playing"
468,00:35:36.38,00:35:36.38,for a truck.Yau-Man wins the truck and
469,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,"immediately begins a negotiationwith you, Dreamz."
470,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,"Tell me how that went down.>> After Yau-Man won the truck,"
471,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,he wanted to make an agreement.He said if I make it to the
472,00:35:51.79,00:35:51.79,"final four, and he's stillthere, and I win immunity, to"
473,00:35:55.25,00:35:55.25,"give it to him.And I was like, ""Deal!"""
474,00:36:00.00,00:36:00.00,"You know, that's nothing to me.So he gave me the truck."
475,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,I'm a great man of my word.I owe Yau-Man to get the
476,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,"immunity at final four, and I'mgoing to see to it that I do get"
477,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"it at final four.>> PROBST: So, Yau-Man, what do"
478,00:36:12.08,00:36:12.08,you expect from Dreamz in thatnegotiation?
479,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,>> I expect Dreamz to live up tohis word.
480,00:36:18.42,00:36:18.42,It's a risk that he will renegeon it.
481,00:36:20.54,00:36:20.54,Certainly the bigger risk isthat the next two rounds there's
482,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,"a big target on my back, so Idon't make it to the final four."
483,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,But I thought it's worth thatrisk.
484,00:36:29.29,00:36:29.29,"The other part also is Dreamzneeds the car, and that's my big"
485,00:36:33.21,00:36:33.21,"heart, let him have the car.>> PROBST: Let's talk about the"
486,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,"hidden immunity idol.It's come out that Yau-Man, at"
487,00:36:39.71,00:36:39.71,"least at one point, had it.Who knows who has it now?"
488,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,"Boo, you worried?>> It doesn't matter to me who"
489,00:36:45.67,00:36:45.67,"has it at this point.>> PROBST: Cassandra, do you"
490,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,"believe that?>> No, it definitely matters who"
491,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,"has the idol.I mean, the idol can be used in"
492,00:36:54.33,00:36:54.33,the next two tribal councils.And I think that's critical to
493,00:36:56.83,00:36:56.83,"the game, who has the idol.>> PROBST: Million-dollar"
494,00:37:00.79,00:37:00.79,"blunder, Earl, if you have theidol and don't play it and get"
495,00:37:03.42,00:37:03.42,voted out.>> You definitely have to gauge
496,00:37:06.00,00:37:06.00,"when you're going to need it.We're in the top six, so every"
497,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,"single time we come here, you'rea target."
498,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,There's no guarantees foranything.
499,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,"And now we got to start eatingeach other, so that's when you"
500,00:37:15.42,00:37:15.42,"really start to worry.>> PROBST: Stacy, how scared are"
501,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,you tonight that it's you?>> I'm worried just because I'm
502,00:37:24.38,00:37:24.38,"a late-comer in this alliance,and I think that before they"
503,00:37:28.21,00:37:28.21,"cannibalize each other, they maywant to try to get me out."
504,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,But I guess I'll find outtonight.
505,00:37:34.25,00:37:34.25,">> PROBST: Dreamz, how aboutyou?"
506,00:37:35.83,00:37:35.83,">> I'm definitely worried,because me saying that I'll give"
507,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"him the immunity idol at four,people be like, ""Oh, I can't let"
508,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,"him get to four.""I mean, so I would think Yau-Man"
509,00:37:43.12,00:37:43.12,"would try to protect me a littlebit until four, but you can"
510,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,"never tell.You know, we haven't talked"
511,00:37:47.29,00:37:47.29,"about it.>> PROBST: Stacy, what do you"
512,00:37:49.88,00:37:49.88,think will be the result fromtonight's vote?
513,00:37:52.12,00:37:52.12,>> I think that everyone wantsto seem like they're playing
514,00:37:54.29,00:37:54.29,"nice, but I think that there'sgoing to be lines drawn and"
515,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,"there's going to be divisionamongst the tight-knit alliance,"
516,00:38:00.71,00:38:00.71,because I don't think that it'sall going to be a vote one way
517,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,or the other.I think it's going to be split.
518,00:38:11.75,00:38:11.75,">> PROBST: Well, there'sobviously a lot of uneasiness"
519,00:38:14.38,00:38:14.38,surrounding this vote tonight.If you have the idol and you
520,00:38:17.08,00:38:17.08,"need to play it, you wouldpresent it to me before I read"
521,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,the votes.Boo has individual immunity.
522,00:38:22.29,00:38:22.29,You can't vote for him.Everybody else is fair game.
523,00:38:25.46,00:38:25.46,"It's time to vote.Earl, you're up."
524,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,">> Good-bye, Stacy.Sorry, it's your turn."
525,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"Good luck.>> Sorry, bro, that's how the"
526,00:38:58.75,00:38:58.75,game goes.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

529,00:39:26.38,00:39:26.38,to do so.Yau-Man is playing the hidden
530,00:39:53.21,00:39:53.21,immunity idol.Yau-Man's immune from tonight's
531,00:39:57.79,00:39:57.79,vote.Any votes cast for Yau-Man do
532,00:40:01.08,00:40:01.08,not count.I'll read the votes.
533,00:40:08.04,00:40:08.04,"First vote, Stacy.Yau-Man."
534,00:40:15.67,00:40:15.67,That vote does not count.One vote Stacy.
535,00:40:21.21,00:40:21.21,Stacy.Two votes Stacy.
536,00:40:27.17,00:40:27.17,Yau-Man.That vote does not count.
537,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"Stacy, you have two votes.There are two votes left."
538,00:40:33.62,00:40:33.62,The best you can hope for is atie with another person.
539,00:40:38.00,00:40:38.00,"Which means if this next vote isfor Yau-Man, you're going home."
540,00:40:47.38,00:40:47.38,It's Yau-Man.13th person voted out and the
541,00:40:50.17,00:40:50.17,"seventh member of our jury,Stacy."
542,00:41:00.83,00:41:00.83,"Stacy, the tribe has spoken.It's time for you to go."
543,00:41:18.58,00:41:18.58,"Well, there's still thepossibility that yet another"
544,00:41:21.04,00:41:21.04,hidden immunity idol might comeinto play.
545,00:41:24.38,00:41:24.38,The last time you can use it isat the next tribal council.
