191,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,Let's go. Get y'all a plate.
192,00:11:30.58,00:11:30.58,">> Y'all eat, y'all serve your own selves first."
193,00:11:33.21,00:11:33.21,">> Eat slow so you don't, you know, you don't get sick."
194,00:11:35.75,00:11:35.75,">> This is real food. Man! >> Oh, this is good cheese."
195,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,>> Anything is good at this point.
196,00:11:41.00,00:11:41.00,">> I'm trying to just, like, keep myself contained."
197,00:11:44.17,00:11:44.17,>> After I survey the land and look at the situation a little
198,00:11:46.71,00:11:46.71,"more, um, I will be looking for the Immunity Idol."
199,00:11:49.29,00:11:49.29,"Yau and I have an upper hand, 'cause we're the only ones that"
200,00:11:52.62,00:11:52.62,know about Exile Island and the clues and what's going on.
201,00:11:55.12,00:11:55.12,"So I am not worried, not at all, about someone else trying to"
202,00:11:59.83,00:11:59.83,"find the idol, 'cause they have no idea that it's even on this"
203,00:12:02.54,00:12:02.54,island. (chattering and whooping)
204,00:12:06.83,00:12:06.83,">> I'm gonna have a mimosa. >> Oh, a mimosa?"
205,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,"Don't you dare have a hangover. >> Guys, cheers."
206,00:12:11.38,00:12:11.38,>> Yummy. >> To the new Moto.
207,00:12:12.92,00:12:12.92,>> OTHERS: To the new Moto. >> New Moto.
208,00:12:15.50,00:12:15.50,">> Moto-licious, baby. >> Oh, my God, let's eat!"
209,00:12:31.96,00:12:31.96,Let's eat! >> Big morale went up.
210,00:12:34.75,00:12:34.75,"Don't let this morale go down. >> Well, I'll tell you, it's"
211,00:12:37.21,00:12:37.21,"rough out here. >> I want to say something,"
212,00:12:38.62,00:12:38.62,though. There was two choices-- either
213,00:12:40.25,00:12:40.25,had that tribe over there... >> Don't worry about it.
214,00:12:42.58,00:12:42.58,"Don't worry about it. >> No, no, no, but I'm saying,"
215,00:12:44.42,00:12:44.42,"like, we're gonna be way stronger in challenges, and if"
216,00:12:46.71,00:12:46.71,"tomorrow we have a challenge, we kick ass, man."
217,00:12:49.21,00:12:49.21,>> Yeah. >> We're gonna kick some ass.
218,00:12:50.67,00:12:50.67,It's men now. (several talking)
219,00:12:53.08,00:12:53.08,">> Men! Yeah! >> Showing up here, you know,"
220,00:12:56.54,00:12:56.54,it's really not that bad. >> Whoa!
221,00:12:59.75,00:12:59.75,">> Yeah, I had a strong alliance-- it was Boo, Stacy,"
222,00:13:03.12,00:13:03.12,"Lisi and myself-- um, but I always felt there was kind of a"
223,00:13:05.79,00:13:05.79,power struggle. The girls were difficult to
224,00:13:07.54,00:13:07.54,predict. I wasn't sure where Boo stood
225,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,half the time. So being in a tribe where I feel
226,00:13:12.96,00:13:12.96,"like, you know, we're all gung-ho, we're all warriors,"
227,00:13:15.33,00:13:15.33,"we're ready to take these guys on, I'm very happy with it."
228,00:13:18.42,00:13:18.42,"(whooping) And this may sound weird, but,"
229,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"like, I'm glad that there are no women here, man."
230,00:13:23.17,00:13:23.17,"The women are just politics and it's just, like..."
231,00:13:24.96,00:13:24.96,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. >> That's why... that's why"
232,00:13:26.75,00:13:26.75,"every person that's been voted off has been a woman, you know"
233,00:13:29.58,00:13:29.58,"what I mean? >> It's just, like, I was"
234,00:13:31.29,00:13:31.29,getting so sick of dealing with them.
235,00:13:33.12,00:13:33.12,>> I-I only need to ask one question.
236,00:13:34.62,00:13:34.62,"How was Sylvia in camp, man? (laughter)"
237,00:13:37.67,00:13:37.67,>> Shoot myself in the face... >> That's why she was out.
238,00:13:40.04,00:13:40.04,">> Just excited to, you know, be eating, hanging out with some of"
239,00:13:43.17,00:13:43.17,"the boys. No offense, I love women, I love"
240,00:13:44.92,00:13:44.92,"'em, I love to touch 'em and make out and have conversations"
241,00:13:48.54,00:13:48.54,"with 'em, get along well. But, uh, you know, in this type"
242,00:13:51.21,00:13:51.21,"of environment, this type of game, you don't need any, like,"
243,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,"stupid, like, girl stories or distractions or any stupid"
244,00:13:56.88,00:13:56.88,things like that. >> There's a little quote that
245,00:13:58.62,00:13:58.62,"gets me through, like, a lot of, like, rough times."
246,00:14:00.67,00:14:00.67,"I don't know if you ever seen The Count of Monte Cristo, the"
247,00:14:03.12,00:14:03.12,"movie. >> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
248,00:14:04.25,00:14:04.25,">> It starts out, there's a line in it that goes, um... ""Life is"
249,00:14:08.25,00:14:08.25,"a storm, my young friends. One day you're battered in the"
250,00:14:11.21,00:14:11.21,"sunlight, and you're shattered on the rocks the next."
251,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,But it's what you do when that storm comes that makes you a
252,00:14:15.88,00:14:15.88,"man. So shout, do your worst, for I"
253,00:14:17.96,00:14:17.96,"shall do mine, and the fates will know you as a man."""
254,00:14:20.42,00:14:20.42,>> Yeah. >> I remember that scene.
255,00:14:22.04,00:14:22.04,"That scene was awesome, too. We'll say that every time we go"
256,00:14:24.46,00:14:24.46,to a challenge. (laughter)
257,00:14:30.17,00:14:30.17,">> Yeah, we have different strategies, my friend, but I"
258,00:14:32.21,00:14:32.21,"assure you, the result is the same."
259,00:14:34.29,00:14:34.29,>> Yes. (thunder rumbles)
260,00:14:37.21,00:14:37.21,">> What's going on? Yeah, what's the situation out"
261,00:14:38.62,00:14:38.62,here? (indistinct conversation)
262,00:14:41.12,00:14:41.12,">> We have tons of coconuts, tons of crabs."
263,00:14:43.58,00:14:43.58,So we go crabbing and snails. >> We should light a fire before
264,00:14:46.25,00:14:46.25,"that, or...? >> Yeah, light a fire, get one"
265,00:14:48.04,00:14:48.04,"going, and then go fishing and catch some hermit crabs."
266,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,>> You want to have Anthony just get the fire going and we'll go
267,00:14:52.71,00:14:52.71,"fishing or...? >> Yeah. If you don't mind,"
268,00:14:54.33,00:14:54.33,Anthony? >> Is that cool?
269,00:14:55.38,00:14:55.38,">> All right, let's do it. >> Hey, let's all grab some wood"
270,00:14:57.21,00:14:57.21,"on the way back, though. >> All right."
271,00:14:58.79,00:14:58.79,>> Cool. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
272,00:15:05.21,00:15:05.21,"(indistinct chatter) >> So, there's this time in"
273,00:15:09.58,00:15:09.58,"everybody's life, in high school, that first gym class,"
274,00:15:15.25,00:15:15.25,"when everybody has to go take that first shower afterwards,"
275,00:15:19.29,00:15:19.29,"when nobody really wants to take their shirt off, except for the"
276,00:15:22.67,00:15:22.67,guys who know that they're cut. I'm a nerd; I know this.
277,00:15:25.71,00:15:25.71,"I'm a nerd, I'm a geek, I'm a dweeb, or whatever the hell you"
278,00:15:28.38,00:15:28.38,want to call it. I have been for forever.
279,00:15:31.12,00:15:31.12,"This is the burly man team, and right now I'm obviously the"
280,00:15:34.08,00:15:34.08,"weakest person in the tribe, and, um, I got my work cut out"
281,00:15:37.58,00:15:37.58,for me. I am so screwed right now.
282,00:15:41.17,00:15:41.17,Uh... wow.
283,00:15:47.46,00:15:47.46,(bat screeches) (chittering)
284,00:15:52.25,00:15:52.25,>> We're gonna have to go with these.
285,00:15:54.62,00:15:54.62,>> Yeah. >> So we'll use that line.
286,00:15:56.38,00:15:56.38,I think that's the thinnest line.
287,00:15:58.04,00:15:58.04,"I'm gonna use these two. >> Yeah, there's two more..."
288,00:16:01.62,00:16:01.62,">> This switch threw a couple of roadblocks into my million,"
289,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,but this game is full of roadblocks.
290,00:16:08.04,00:16:08.04,I was counting my million. (laughs)
291,00:16:11.17,00:16:11.17,"I had it tight, my plan was tight, but it's changed."
292,00:16:14.96,00:16:14.96,It might come full circle if things work out like I want.
293,00:16:17.58,00:16:17.58,"We'll see. >> Hopefully, we can have some"
294,00:16:20.50,00:16:20.50,"fish, potatoes and rice for breakfast."
295,00:16:23.33,00:16:23.33,"Is that a nice, big, energetic breakfast with some coffee?"
296,00:16:25.83,00:16:25.83,">> Uh-huh. >> There's three old Moto and,"
297,00:16:29.29,00:16:29.29,"uh, three old Ravu on the new Team Moto that I started."
298,00:16:34.08,00:16:34.08,And I know that makes Boo a little nervous.
299,00:16:35.92,00:16:35.92,So I know the game is really beginning.
300,00:16:38.67,00:16:38.67,They're gonna try to get a swing vote... from somebody.
301,00:16:42.67,00:16:42.67,But everything is gonna have to go through me. Everything.
302,00:16:46.29,00:16:46.29,My plan was always to have your friends close and your enemies
303,00:16:50.79,00:16:50.79,closer. >> Earl.
304,00:17:09.71,00:17:09.71,>> Delivery service. >> (laughs): It's not much.
305,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,I got you guys a little shot each.
306,00:17:18.08,00:17:18.08,">> Thank you, ma'am. >> You're welcome."
307,00:17:21.42,00:17:21.42,"(sighs): Ah. >> Wow, coffee!"
308,00:17:24.75,00:17:24.75,>> This place is definitely positive for me than the last
309,00:17:27.00,00:17:27.00,"camp. I felt, as far as alliances, I"
310,00:17:29.25,00:17:29.25,was on the out. I like Earl a lot.
311,00:17:32.58,00:17:32.58,"I like, um, Yau-Man a lot. You know, I'm a free agent right"
312,00:17:35.62,00:17:35.62,now. I'm really just gonna try to see
313,00:17:37.54,00:17:37.54,how the cards fold over the next couple of days.
314,00:17:41.17,00:17:41.17,">> Cassandra, do you think Boo feels nervous?"
315,00:17:43.12,00:17:43.12,">> Oh, very. He had a lot of allies on the other team."
316,00:17:47.17,00:17:47.17,">> It's a different chemistry and dynamic now, so..."
317,00:17:49.62,00:17:49.62,>> Mm-hmm. >> You could be a swing vote.
318,00:17:52.00,00:17:52.00,>> I know. >> You could change everything.
319,00:17:53.88,00:17:53.88,">> Oh, I know. >> And Boo could be gone."
320,00:17:55.83,00:17:55.83,>> I know. >> Just like that.
321,00:17:57.67,00:17:57.67,>> I know. >> Just like that.
322,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,>> Mm-hmm. (laughs) >> A word or two here and
323,00:18:03.04,00:18:03.04,"there in the right situation, you paint the picture the right"
324,00:18:05.46,00:18:05.46,"way, she could be right on my side."
325,00:18:08.79,00:18:08.79,Appreciate you bringing the coffee.
326,00:18:10.54,00:18:10.54,">> Sure, sure. You guys keep fishing."
327,00:18:13.67,00:18:13.67,">> Yeah, we're trying to do something."
328,00:18:15.71,00:18:15.71,>> (laughs) >> It'd be nice to have a little
329,00:18:17.75,00:18:17.75,"meat. I have Yau-Man, I have Michelle."
330,00:18:23.75,00:18:23.75,"They're all about the team. All you need is that one vote,"
331,00:18:27.92,00:18:27.92,and then who has all the power then?
332,00:18:31.88,00:18:31.88,That would be me. >> I got my work cut out for me.
333,00:18:47.04,00:18:47.04,'Cause right now I guess I've replaced Yau-Man as the fire
334,00:18:49.46,00:18:49.46,tender and the water tender. And right now I feel pretty
335,00:18:54.75,00:18:54.75,alone. I got nobody to trust.
336,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,I have absolutely no one to trust over here.
337,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,And... I got to see if I can change that.
338,00:19:02.96,00:19:02.96,"But unfortunately, I'm left back here at the homestead to tend"
339,00:19:05.50,00:19:05.50,"the fires, while... the big men go off and Cookie's still here"
340,00:19:09.67,00:19:09.67,"at the campfire. >> Look at this, man."
341,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,"Look at all these... Hey, Rocky, come here."
342,00:19:18.42,00:19:18.42,>> What's that? >> Look at all these crabs.
343,00:19:20.17,00:19:20.17,>> I'll hold the stick up here and I'll shove 'em off.
344,00:19:23.46,00:19:23.46,">> That's your shell, buddy. >> Ooh!"
345,00:19:28.08,00:19:28.08,">> He's right there. >> Oh, oh, oh!"
346,00:19:29.83,00:19:29.83,>> He's right here. He's right here.
347,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"Step on him. >> You like that, don't you,"
348,00:19:34.08,00:19:34.08,"crab? >> Hey, hey, hey."
349,00:19:37.08,00:19:37.08,">> I mean, what I felt these guys needed-- um, Anthony, Rocky"
350,00:19:40.79,00:19:40.79,and Mookie-- they just needed a kick-start.
351,00:19:43.04,00:19:43.04,"Now, food notwithstanding, these are men that I think are true"
352,00:19:46.17,00:19:46.17,"competitors, and if I was losing every single time, I mean, I"
353,00:19:49.38,00:19:49.38,"mean, that would definitely do something to my psyche."
354,00:19:51.75,00:19:51.75,">> Wait, so how is Anthony holding up?"
355,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,Is he doing all right? >> He's doing all right.
356,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,>> I'm not gonna say... He looked a little flustered at
357,00:19:57.50,00:19:57.50,"some of those challenges. >> Uh, he's a little effeminate."
358,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,You know? >> There's nothing wrong with
359,00:20:03.83,00:20:03.83,"that. >> No, no, I'm not saying that"
360,00:20:05.88,00:20:05.88,"anything's wrong with it, it's just, you know... sometimes it's"
361,00:20:09.21,00:20:09.21,hard for him to carry his own weight.
362,00:20:11.54,00:20:11.54,">> Who-who... If y'all had three people going to merge, who would"
363,00:20:13.83,00:20:13.83,it have been? >> I mean... all strategy
364,00:20:15.75,00:20:15.75,"changes, you know what I mean? >> Yeah. It's crazy now."
365,00:20:19.08,00:20:19.08,Everything is crazy now. >> There's a lot of crab...
366,00:20:23.50,00:20:23.50,"Coming into this, it's three-three."
367,00:20:25.12,00:20:25.12,Majority rules always in Survivor.
368,00:20:26.96,00:20:26.96,So I knew that I needed to bring in one person from the other
369,00:20:30.17,00:20:30.17,"tribe. Rocky, I don't know very well,"
370,00:20:31.42,00:20:31.42,"but I know he doesn't get along with Dreamz, and I know he's"
371,00:20:34.00,00:20:34.00,sort of a volatile personality. Anthony does not strike me as a

390,00:22:27.25,00:22:27.25,psychologically and mentally. Now you know you can get fish.

416,00:24:05.83,00:24:05.83,"through five gates. Making things more difficult,"
417,00:24:10.17,00:24:10.17,"the tribe paths intersect, which means the two tribes could and"
418,00:24:14.42,00:24:14.42,probably will collide before you reach the finish line.

539,00:30:15.88,00:30:15.88,the boys go out hunting and fishing.
540,00:30:21.21,00:30:21.21,So I'm a little bit in panic mode right now.

542,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,What kind of whacked-out stuff is that?
543,00:30:29.88,00:30:29.88,Can I go fishing with the boys? No.
544,00:30:33.00,00:30:33.00,"You can't tell underneath this calm demeanor, but right now"
545,00:30:35.67,00:30:35.67,Anthony is a turmoil of waves and emotions and worried sick
546,00:30:39.25,00:30:39.25,that he's getting voted out tonight.
547,00:30:41.00,00:30:41.00,">> Like I said, bro, we made it this far."
548,00:30:44.83,00:30:44.83,"I don't know how. I'm serious, guys."

550,00:30:50.33,00:30:50.33,"You know, he's not a bad guy. But, like..."
551,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,So you gotta go backwards before you go forward
552,00:31:02.12,00:31:02.12,"sometimes, buddy. Philosophy in the ocean today."
553,00:31:07.54,00:31:07.54,">> I can tell you now if they bring up a name, it's probably"
554,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,going to be me. >> Anthony talked to me today.
555,00:31:20.00,00:31:20.00,"He wanted me to tell him if it is him or not, which I don't"
556,00:31:22.33,00:31:22.33,know if I'm going to do that either because I pretty much
557,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,"know that it's either going to be him or Rocky, so..."
558,00:31:27.83,00:31:27.83,I think Rocky should go because he's so emotionally driven and
559,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,he's lazy. He don't do nothing around the
560,00:31:32.83,00:31:32.83,"camp. Anthony makes the water, you"
561,00:31:35.17,00:31:35.17,know; he keeps the fire going. But Anthony being weaker than
562,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,Rocky in challenges is probably going to have a lot of
563,00:31:42.88,00:31:42.88,"effect on the rest of the team. >> You know, Rocky's got a lot"
564,00:32:02.38,00:32:02.38,of emotion. He's got a lot of heart.
565,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,"Sometimes he blows up, man. >> You are right about that."
566,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,>> And I can tell you that caused a whole lot of headache.
567,00:32:15.00,00:32:15.00,">> I see. >> Mook, help me with this real "
568,00:32:21.21,00:32:21.21,quick. So I don't... I don't put out
569,00:32:23.08,00:32:23.08,the fire. >> Ow!
570,00:32:27.88,00:32:27.88,I just burned my foot! >> Come on!
571,00:32:31.08,00:32:31.08,">> Chill out. >> See what I'm saying, Mook."
572,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,"That's why I wanted you to help me out, bro."
573,00:32:49.08,00:32:49.08,>> Anthony! >> Rocky has a few screws loose
574,00:32:52.12,00:32:52.12,in his head. >> Yeah!
575,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,Huh! It's over!
576,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,>> He yells at people and tells people what to do.
577,00:33:01.12,00:33:01.12,I noticed that since I got in here.
578,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,>> Anthony! Which is the drinking water?
579,00:33:06.04,00:33:06.04,">> I mean, Anthony is his little bitch."
580,00:33:07.42,00:33:07.42,"""Anthony, make the water. Anthony, put the fire."""
581,00:33:10.62,00:33:10.62,">> Put another log on the fire there, Anthony?"
582,00:33:12.96,00:33:12.96,">> I see myself really far from, from being friends, or"
583,00:33:17.33,00:33:17.33,"liking Rocky a lot. >> Oh, this food thing..."
584,00:33:19.50,00:33:19.50,"I might have to eat my portion of bread and cheese,"
585,00:33:21.29,00:33:21.29,bro. >> And I wouldn't want him
586,00:33:23.71,00:33:23.71,making the merger because all he would cause is a lot of turmoil
587,00:33:26.58,00:33:26.58,"and you know, a mess. >> So I don't know, man."
588,00:33:30.50,00:33:30.50,"I talked to Alex, and he told me he didn't know who he was"
589,00:33:33.17,00:33:33.17,going to vote for yet because of the...
590,00:33:36.54,00:33:36.54,"Of the Rocky situation. >> The thing is, Rocky's really"
591,00:33:39.00,00:33:39.00,bold though. Rocky's really bold.
592,00:33:41.75,00:33:41.75,">> But, uh... >> Watch out, man."
593,00:33:43.83,00:33:43.83,>> I'm going to break something. >> Just a bit harsh...
594,00:33:46.25,00:33:46.25,">> No, I mean, I'll tell you the truth, man."
595,00:33:48.92,00:33:48.92,"My vote right now, it will be 50-50 right now between and you"
596,00:33:52.58,00:33:52.58,"Rocky. So, but I mean, this is... "
597,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,"That's my decision, man, and it's not going to change until"
598,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,"we get there, so... >> It's all good."
599,00:34:17.12,00:34:17.12,>> Am I going to miss Anthony when he's gone?
600,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,"We had a couple of good times, you know, when we started like"
601,00:34:22.83,00:34:22.83,"not really... Not really, no."
602,00:34:26.12,00:34:26.12,"If he had a drop of social skills, it might-- it might"
603,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,make this decision hard. But he hasn't had any since day
604,00:34:32.12,00:34:32.12,"one. Anthony, where is the flint?"
605,00:34:34.88,00:34:34.88,"And then when he tries to, like, finagle his way through"
606,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,"things, he has to go like, go around-- no offense--"
607,00:34:40.08,00:34:40.08,like a girl. Like a little female.
608,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,( whining ) Whining and trying to work on your sympathy.
609,00:34:45.50,00:34:45.50,You know what I mean? It doesn't work.

613,00:35:17.62,00:35:17.62,"crabs, no anything. So I was like, you know, for 15"
614,00:35:20.96,00:35:20.96,"days it wasn't even really, like you know, trying to"
615,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,"survive, so in my mind I was like now I'm going to actually"
616,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"start playing Survivor. >> PROBST: Mookie, tell me"
617,00:35:29.67,00:35:29.67,about today. After you're done talking
618,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,"about the challenge, you got to get back to life, right?"
619,00:35:33.92,00:35:33.92,">> Yeah, we got back from the challenge, and right away we're"
620,00:35:35.71,00:35:35.71,"hungry, so Dreamz and Rocky, Edgardo, Alex and I go out"
621,00:35:39.04,00:35:39.04,"fishing over on some other part. Anthony is working the fire,"
622,00:35:43.21,00:35:43.21,"boiling some water, filling up the canteens."
623,00:35:45.38,00:35:45.38,"Everyone is doing everything, you know, so it's... it's "
624,00:35:48.08,00:35:48.08,"pretty good. >> PROBST: So, Anthony, does it"
625,00:35:50.29,00:35:50.29,"concern you at all that with Tribal Council looming, the"
626,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,"entire tribe is somewhere else, and you're boiling water?"
627,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,">> You know, I'm not going to lie."
628,00:35:58.46,00:35:58.46,"I was concerned. I mean, you don't know what"
629,00:36:00.38,00:36:00.38,"everybody else is saying because you're isolated, but"
630,00:36:02.08,00:36:02.08,you do what you get assigned to do.
631,00:36:04.46,00:36:04.46,">> To be honest with you, Anthony, this is the best"
632,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,advice I can give you. Put your cards on the table.
633,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,"If you're upset the way you're getting treated, you got to put"
634,00:36:10.92,00:36:10.92,"your foot down and say, ""Hey, guy, you know, I don't"
635,00:36:13.00,00:36:13.00,mind doing the fire. I need help real quick and
636,00:36:15.83,00:36:15.83,"then do what you want."" Let people know what's going"
637,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,"through your mind. Because if you don't tell them,"
638,00:36:20.04,00:36:20.04,how are they going to know? You know what I mean?
639,00:36:21.92,00:36:21.92,No one's a mind reader. At least I'm not.
640,00:36:23.46,00:36:23.46,I don't know about you boys. So maybe if you take some of
641,00:36:26.25,00:36:26.25,those words and you can use them later on in your life or
642,00:36:28.25,00:36:28.25,"tomorrow or the next day or ten minutes from now, whenever you"
643,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,"want to, you know what I mean? >> PROBST: Anthony, pretty"
644,00:36:34.67,00:36:34.67,"candid advice, and still, you're just sitting there."
645,00:36:38.04,00:36:38.04,What is so hard for you about speaking up and owning your own
646,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,"space? >> You know, I tried to own my"
647,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"space early on, and, you know what, I got... I got knocked"
648,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,"back. >> You can't give up, bro."
649,00:36:49.42,00:36:49.42,You can't give up. >> Who says I gave up?
650,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,">> You get knocked back, you stand up and take another knock"
651,00:36:53.08,00:36:53.08,in the mouth. You can't back down from
652,00:36:55.12,00:36:55.12,nobody at any point in time in your life 'cause you won't get
653,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,respect. That's the problem.
654,00:36:58.88,00:36:58.88,">> Rock, let me tell you... >> I'm trying to help you out."
655,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,"I'm giving a life lesson here, buddy."
656,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,>> I'm going to tell you the truth-- the only person that I
657,00:37:04.04,00:37:04.04,really have not felt I've gotten any respect from has really been
658,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,"you. >> No, guy, you got to"
659,00:37:09.83,00:37:09.83,respect... first you got to comfortable...
660,00:37:11.54,00:37:11.54,>> I do respect myself. >> You have to be comfortable
661,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,in your own skin. You're not.
662,00:37:14.46,00:37:14.46,You can't sit up here and tell these people how you feel or
663,00:37:16.62,00:37:16.62,back at camp or anything like that.
664,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,"You have poor social skills. >> Oh, I got poor social skills?"
665,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,">> You have poor social skills, bro, yes!"
666,00:37:23.04,00:37:23.04,">> Dude, Please, please, please, Rocky."
667,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,>> I'm not going to debate with you.
668,00:37:26.29,00:37:26.29,I'm trying to help you out. >> Do you know anything about
669,00:37:27.96,00:37:27.96,"me? >> No, because you don't tell"
670,00:37:29.04,00:37:29.04,"me nothing, bro. >> Have you asked?"
671,00:37:30.88,00:37:30.88,Have you asked me? >> Please don't raise your
672,00:37:32.46,00:37:32.46,"voice in my ear. No, guy, here's the thing:"
673,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,I talk to people who talk to me; I sit down like men.
674,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,>> You're talking I'm not a man again.
675,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,">> I didn't say that. Grow a spine, bro."
676,00:37:40.62,00:37:40.62,">> You've done it before, Rocky. >> Seriously, like a jellyfish."
677,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,Toughen up. I don't know what's going on in
678,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"your mind, guy, but you act like a little girl sometimes,"
679,00:37:48.25,00:37:48.25,okay? You're effeminate.
680,00:37:50.29,00:37:50.29,">> Oh, I'm effeminate. >> Extremely effeminate, yes."
681,00:37:52.29,00:37:52.29,">> I'm sorry, please. >> Toughen up, toughen up."
682,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,">> No, no, no. >> Toughen up."
683,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,>> This is why I don't say anything.
684,00:37:57.38,00:37:57.38,">> Keep going, man! Fight for what's yours!"
685,00:37:59.33,00:37:59.33,Take the skirt off a little bit; let's go!
686,00:38:02.29,00:38:02.29,">> PROBST: Alex, why were your hands buried in your head."
687,00:38:06.04,00:38:06.04,"Why is this bad? >> You know, I was thinking to"
688,00:38:08.12,00:38:08.12,"myself, wow, that is some tough love."
689,00:38:10.88,00:38:10.88,I feel bad because I think what he said might have hurt
690,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,"Anthony's feelings. To be honest, that would hurt"
691,00:38:15.38,00:38:15.38,my feelings. So I just felt bad for the guy.
692,00:38:18.58,00:38:18.58,"And that's... all I felt was empathy, that's it."
693,00:38:21.38,00:38:21.38,">> PROBST: Anthony, Rocky could easily just kiss your ass and"
694,00:38:24.38,00:38:24.38,"say you're a good guy, Anthony, don't worry about it,"
695,00:38:26.75,00:38:26.75,and write your name down. What are you feeling right now?
696,00:38:30.08,00:38:30.08,>> I appreciate all of the advice about standing up for
697,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,myself. What I don't appreciate is the
698,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,name-calling. >> PROBST: Do you want to be in
699,00:38:37.38,00:38:37.38,"this game? >> Yes, I want to be in this"
700,00:38:39.33,00:38:39.33,game! You know why I want to be in
701,00:38:40.88,00:38:40.88,this game? Because I worked for so much.
702,00:38:42.67,00:38:42.67,"I've popped myself, hurt myself in these challenges."
703,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,"I held back from myself for giving people of myself, I held"
704,00:38:48.25,00:38:48.25,back from giving Rock of myself. You know why I haven't said
705,00:38:51.08,00:38:51.08,anything? 'Cause I want to make sure
706,00:38:53.21,00:38:53.21,that the team works so we can win a freaking challenge.
707,00:38:55.92,00:38:55.92,"I was trying to keep people cool, keep people calm, keep"
708,00:38:57.58,00:38:57.58,"people happy, but you know what, screw that."
709,00:38:59.79,00:38:59.79,"If it means I have to piss people off to stay here, which"
710,00:39:01.42,00:39:01.42,"doesn't make any friggin' sense to me, then fine, so be it."
711,00:39:04.17,00:39:04.17,"But I'm here, all right? I'll be brutally honest with"
712,00:39:06.08,00:39:06.08,people. But I need to be here.
713,00:39:08.25,00:39:08.25,I deserve to be here. I want it.
714,00:39:10.12,00:39:10.12,"And if you guys want it, you need it, you want to keep me"
715,00:39:11.54,00:39:11.54,here because I'll help you get there.
716,00:39:14.08,00:39:14.08,"Oh, I'll help you get there. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
717,00:39:21.00,00:39:21.00,"vote. Mookie, you're up."
718,00:39:31.92,00:39:31.92,>> I was getting respect back before you got... man.
719,00:39:35.33,00:39:35.33,"And, uh... watch your mouth. >> It's time to go."
720,00:39:48.29,00:39:48.29,"I don't know, I hope you can take this experience and learn"
721,00:39:51.42,00:39:51.42,"from it, and I think you'll be all right if you can do that."
722,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,"Have a good one, buddy. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
723,00:40:05.75,00:40:05.75,"votes. Okay, once the votes are read,"
724,00:40:17.04,00:40:17.04,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
725,00:40:19.04,00:40:19.04,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
726,00:40:21.12,00:40:21.12,I'll read the votes. First vote: Rocky.
727,00:40:27.75,00:40:27.75,>> Huh. >> PROBST: Anthony.
728,00:40:32.96,00:40:32.96,"One vote Rocky, one vote Anthony."
729,00:40:36.88,00:40:36.88,Anthony. Two votes Anthony.
730,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,Anthony. That's three votes Anthony.
731,00:40:46.88,00:40:46.88,One vote Rocky. Sixth person voted out of
732,00:40:53.17,00:40:53.17,Survivor: Fiji: Anthony. That's four; that's enough.
733,00:40:56.21,00:40:56.21,"You need to bring me your torch. Anthony, the tribe has spoken."
734,00:41:10.92,00:41:10.92,Time for you to go. >> Good luck.

737,00:41:29.75,00:41:29.75,will certainly have a big impact on how well this tribe
738,00:41:32.12,00:41:32.12,does. Grab your torches.
739,00:41:34.08,00:41:34.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
