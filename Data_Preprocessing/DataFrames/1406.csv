335,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,I have absolutely no one totrust over here.
336,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,And... I got to see if I canchange that.
337,00:19:02.96,00:19:02.96,"But unfortunately, I'm left backhere at the homestead to tend"

351,00:19:46.17,00:19:46.17,"competitors, and if I was losingevery single time, I mean, I"
352,00:19:49.38,00:19:49.38,"mean, that would definitely dosomething to my psyche."
353,00:19:51.75,00:19:51.75,">> Wait, so how is Anthonyholding up?"
354,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,Is he doing all right?>> He's doing all right.
355,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,>> I'm not gonna say...He looked a little flustered at
356,00:19:57.50,00:19:57.50,"some of those challenges.>> Uh, he's a little effeminate."
357,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,You know?>> There's nothing wrong with
358,00:20:03.83,00:20:03.83,"that.>> No, no, I'm not saying that"
359,00:20:05.88,00:20:05.88,"anything's wrong with it, it'sjust, you know... sometimes it's"
360,00:20:09.21,00:20:09.21,hard for him to carry his ownweight.
361,00:20:11.54,00:20:11.54,">> Who-who... If y'all had threepeople going to merge, who would"
362,00:20:13.83,00:20:13.83,it have been?>> I mean... all strategy

367,00:20:26.96,00:20:26.96,So I knew that I needed to bringin one person from the other

369,00:20:31.42,00:20:31.42,"but I know he doesn't get alongwith Dreamz, and I know he's"
370,00:20:34.00,00:20:34.00,sort of a volatile personality.Anthony does not strike me as a
