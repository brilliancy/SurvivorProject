201,00:14:55.43,00:14:55.43,"then Drake, you will decidewhich member's going"
202,00:14:57.30,00:14:57.30,to give Morgan a visit.And you can help yourself

212,00:15:46.77,00:15:46.77,they're talking about rightthere where it turns to rock.
213,00:15:49.03,00:15:49.03,>> It's really excitingknowing that there's
214,00:15:50.80,00:15:50.80,treasure out there.We're just...
215,00:15:52.43,00:15:52.43,our hands are tied right now'cause it's high tide
216,00:15:54.60,00:15:54.60,"and we can't do anything.But as soon as it's low tide,"
217,00:15:56.97,00:15:56.97,we're going to go out therebecause who knows
218,00:15:59.10,00:15:59.10,"what could be in there.And I'm sure, whatever it is,"
219,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,it could be beneficial.>> We need to figure out who's
220,00:16:03.70,00:16:03.70,going to the camp to taketheir stuff.

222,00:16:07.87,00:16:07.87,but if I could think ofone thing we don't have...
223,00:16:10.27,00:16:10.27,"We need a water juglike the one that we ruined,"
224,00:16:12.17,00:16:12.17,because if we couldfill that thing up...
225,00:16:14.07,00:16:14.07,">> Also something to keepin mind, though, if..."

227,00:16:17.63,00:16:17.63,"and if all they have is a tarp,it would be good to hurt them"
228,00:16:21.13,00:16:21.13,"by taking their tarp.>> Honestly, we don't"
229,00:16:22.80,00:16:22.80,need to hurt them.>> You can live by being wet.
230,00:16:25.40,00:16:25.40,>> We don't need to hurt them.>> I'd let Sandra go.
231,00:16:27.93,00:16:27.93,"Okay, cool.>> Sandra, I'm for it."
232,00:16:29.83,00:16:29.83,">> Good.>> No matter who goes,"

235,00:16:37.67,00:16:37.67,you wouldn't like them either.I was happy that she went
236,00:16:40.60,00:16:40.60,"rather than myself.>> Pirate good, baby."
237,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"Pirate good.>> Oh, my God!"
238,00:16:44.80,00:16:44.80,I can't breathe.( laughs )
239,00:17:00.37,00:17:00.37,>> They kicked our butts today.And one of the reasons
240,00:17:03.30,00:17:03.30,it hurts so muchis because we did so miserably.
241,00:17:06.40,00:17:06.40,We are at a subsistence levelright now.
242,00:17:08.70,00:17:08.70,"I mean, we're just getting by.So, when some little punk from"
243,00:17:11.87,00:17:11.87,"Drake comes by here to takeone of our items, it doesn't"
244,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,"sound like a big deal.But when you're living this,"
245,00:17:17.10,00:17:17.10,it's huge.>> What if the little
246,00:17:19.60,00:17:19.60,motormouth from Drakesays he wants our tarp?
247,00:17:21.63,00:17:21.63,">> Hell, no.Are you-- oh."
248,00:17:26.67,00:17:26.67,"There is no ifs, ands or butsabout it-- he takes that tarp,"
249,00:17:29.80,00:17:29.80,I'm going home.I'm not lying.
250,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,"( laughing )>> So, how y'all doing?"
251,00:18:05.50,00:18:05.50,Are you the ambassadorof the Morgan Tribe?
252,00:18:08.33,00:18:08.33,>> I'm the gooberof the Morgan Tribe.
253,00:18:10.20,00:18:10.20,>> Why do you say that?I'm Sandra.
254,00:18:11.87,00:18:11.87,>> I'm Ryan.Good job today.
255,00:18:13.73,00:18:13.73,>> You guys doing okay?>> We're doing good.
256,00:18:15.63,00:18:15.63,How are you?>> I'm Sandra.
257,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,>> Congratulations today.>> Sander?
258,00:18:19.77,00:18:19.77,">> Sandra.>> Sandra, Andrew."
259,00:18:21.93,00:18:21.93,>> Ryan.>> Nice to meet you.
260,00:18:23.97,00:18:23.97,This is nice.>> How does it compare
261,00:18:25.83,00:18:25.83,"to your camp?>> Ours is nice, too."
262,00:18:28.13,00:18:28.13,"When I arrived at...at the Morgan Tribe,"
263,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,I could not believethat they...
264,00:18:32.33,00:18:32.33,they just didn't have anything.It's unbelievable.
265,00:18:35.57,00:18:35.57,I don't know howthey're getting through.
266,00:18:37.13,00:18:37.13,We managed to buya lot of stuff
267,00:18:39.50,00:18:39.50,"at the village.I mean, we bought tons"
268,00:18:41.97,00:18:41.97,of stuff at the village.So...
269,00:18:44.90,00:18:44.90,"So, there's more stuff.Where's the rest of it?"
270,00:18:47.87,00:18:47.87,And so I looked aroundand I went looking
271,00:18:50.30,00:18:50.30,for the water jug.Where the ...
272,00:18:54.60,00:18:54.60,"is the water jug?Well, they had no water jug."
273,00:19:00.13,00:19:00.13,"So I said, ""Wait a minute."">> Did you make a decision yet?"
274,00:19:02.87,00:19:02.87,>> Yeah.I want that baby up there.
275,00:19:06.17,00:19:06.17,"The tarp.>> Okay, you're going to have"
276,00:19:09.47,00:19:09.47,"to take it down yourself, right?>> Yep."
277,00:19:11.63,00:19:11.63,>> I have to take itdown myself?
278,00:19:13.57,00:19:13.57,>> Absolutely.>> Okay.
279,00:19:15.23,00:19:15.23,">> Go ahead.>> Damn, I didn't think"
280,00:19:17.57,00:19:17.57,I'd come out here to work.>> She's going to ruin it.
281,00:19:23.00,00:19:23.00,I'm going to lay itnice and neat
282,00:19:24.63,00:19:24.63,so you guys can fix it back up.I'll be done in a minute and
283,00:19:31.47,00:19:31.47,I'll be out of you guys's hair.In order for me
284,00:19:34.00,00:19:34.00,"to get the tarp,I had to destroy"
285,00:19:35.97,00:19:35.97,"their whole shelter,which I started feeling bad"
286,00:19:37.87,00:19:37.87,until they startedrunning their mouths.
287,00:19:39.87,00:19:39.87,Can I use one of the knives?>> No.
288,00:19:42.07,00:19:42.07,>> These are our knives.>> I go to a grab a knife
289,00:19:44.77,00:19:44.77,"and the black girl's like,""No, no, no, no, no."
290,00:19:47.07,00:19:47.07,"""You're not goingto use our knife"
291,00:19:48.93,00:19:48.93,"and you better notcut our rope."""
292,00:19:50.43,00:19:50.43,"So I was like, ""Okay.Regardless..."
293,00:19:52.63,00:19:52.63,"I'm taking the tarp down."">> Do what yoygot to do."
294,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,">> Not a problem.>> Don't wreck the shelter,"
295,00:19:57.73,00:19:57.73,"okay?>> No, no, no."
296,00:20:00.00,00:20:00.00,"Hey, I got to dowhat I got to do,"
297,00:20:02.27,00:20:02.27,"right?>> No, not necessarily."
298,00:20:04.43,00:20:04.43,">> Wrapped around...look, there we go."
299,00:20:06.43,00:20:06.43,It's not that bad.It's all good.
300,00:20:10.63,00:20:10.63,"But look, it's comingapart fairly easy."
301,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,>> Sandra came overand she was just...
302,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,I don't know.That whole tribe is just...
303,00:20:20.57,00:20:20.57,is a bunch of ( bleep ).I didn't do
304,00:20:22.53,00:20:22.53,any unnecessary harm.You guys will have this up
305,00:20:26.07,00:20:26.07,"in no time, I'm sure.>> She acted like she was nice"
306,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,about taking the tarp.But I think she was a little bit
307,00:20:31.23,00:20:31.23,too snatchy about itand tore it down
308,00:20:33.33,00:20:33.33,kind of on purpose.>> You don't know how good you
309,00:20:36.53,00:20:36.53,"have it until you see others.Well, you guys sleep tight."
310,00:20:39.83,00:20:39.83,"Don't let the bed bugs bite.And, uh, no hard feelings"
311,00:20:42.63,00:20:42.63,"and I'll see you guys tomorrow,okay? Take care."
312,00:20:44.57,00:20:44.57,>> Bye-bye.She's such a bitch.
313,00:20:51.43,00:20:51.43,>> Andrew... it's getting dark.>> I know.
314,00:20:56.00,00:20:56.00,>> Let's...( thunder rumbling )
315,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,>> We all need to getin the shelter.
316,00:21:16.93,00:21:16.93,>> But I'm going to helpwith the shelter.
317,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,We're gonna get thisall done first.
318,00:21:20.53,00:21:20.53,>> We'll have timeto talk after that.
319,00:21:22.20,00:21:22.20,">> All right, we're goingto get this all done first."
320,00:21:24.37,00:21:24.37,>> Everyone was devastatedby the loss of our tarp
321,00:21:26.50,00:21:26.50,and Osten wasthrowing in the towel.
322,00:21:28.43,00:21:28.43,He was finished.He was ready to walk off.
323,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,"We need people aroundthat are on the ups,"
324,00:21:33.13,00:21:33.13,that are digging this game.And this is great stuff.
325,00:21:36.13,00:21:36.13,"We don't need peoplejust walking around,"
326,00:21:37.90,00:21:37.90,"""I don't... I want to go home,""you know."
327,00:21:40.57,00:21:40.57,It's a real morale-killerfor the tribe.
328,00:21:45.10,00:21:45.10,">> Well, let's look atthe reality here."
329,00:21:47.40,00:21:47.40,There's so many thingsand aspects to the game.
330,00:21:50.40,00:21:50.40,"When it comes downto it, it's mental."
331,00:21:53.10,00:21:53.10,">> I'm in here in shorts, andit's gonna be raining and cold."
332,00:21:55.53,00:21:55.53,"I'm gonna get sick,and I could"
333,00:21:57.37,00:21:57.37,potentially get pneumonia;I've gotten it before.
334,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,I'm just not gonna...I just don't feel
335,00:22:00.97,00:22:00.97,"that-that I need that.>> Yeah, but you're saying"
336,00:22:02.80,00:22:02.80,you-you may be.You don't know.
337,00:22:04.30,00:22:04.30,">> I will be at the end ofthis, tonight."
338,00:22:07.00,00:22:07.00,>> Osten had mentioned to methat he was potentially thinking
339,00:22:09.33,00:22:09.33,about quitting.And I just wanted to talk
340,00:22:11.30,00:22:11.30,to him in a calm fashionand truly understand
341,00:22:13.60,00:22:13.60,and then give himmy personal opinion.
342,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,My opinion is thatyou're giving up.
343,00:22:18.60,00:22:18.60,"You would be a loss,not only for us,"
344,00:22:21.70,00:22:21.70,but for me.We're here in this together.
345,00:22:27.60,00:22:27.60,"I'm just asking youjust to try, at least."
346,00:22:30.10,00:22:30.10,>> All right.>> And that means
347,00:22:32.27,00:22:32.27,being here tonightthroughout the
348,00:22:33.67,00:22:33.67,whole night.>> All right.
349,00:22:36.40,00:22:36.40,I'm gonna let thatmarinate a little bit.
350,00:22:42.23,00:22:42.23,>> I think I'm done now.I've made my peace;
351,00:22:44.60,00:22:44.60,"I've said what I needed to say.It's up to him,"
352,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,what he wants to do.Only he knows
353,00:22:50.13,00:22:50.13,what's best for him.>> It's impossible.
354,00:23:29.40,00:23:29.40,You can't even swim out there.>> Really?
355,00:23:32.87,00:23:32.87,"You see anything cool?>> Went fishing,"
356,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,"to catch some fish, and I wasout there in the, um,"
357,00:23:38.07,00:23:38.07,"heavy tides and the currents.Shot the spear, and, um,"
358,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,"the tip winded up coming offand, um,"
359,00:23:43.70,00:23:43.70,either got lodged under a rockor is swirling around somewhere
360,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,in the tide.But I just couldn't swim
361,00:23:49.87,00:23:49.87,"anymore,so I had to come back in"
362,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37,"and break the news.Yeah, we have a problem."
363,00:23:55.20,00:23:55.20,>> What's wrong?>> This. My spear is dead.
364,00:24:04.60,00:24:04.60,Where is the spear?You didn't even get it?
365,00:24:07.23,00:24:07.23,It'll go to the bottom.>> I looked all over.
366,00:24:09.83,00:24:09.83,"The tide's so hard,it keeps whipping me"
367,00:24:11.97,00:24:11.97,"back out to sea.>> The current was so strong,"
368,00:24:16.00,00:24:16.00,"and it was throwing himinto the rocks, and..."
369,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,"Now, remember this isin our little inlet"
370,00:24:20.23,00:24:20.23,where it's a bathtub.He couldn't find the spearhead.
371,00:24:23.53,00:24:23.53,He gives up.That's why I wanted...
372,00:24:25.77,00:24:25.77,"that's why I was...>> I kept tightening it, too."
373,00:24:28.07,00:24:28.07,I wanted to be theonly one that did that.
374,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,You lost my bag andyou killed my spear.
375,00:24:33.43,00:24:33.43,>> And I didn't do iton purpose.
376,00:24:35.03,00:24:35.03,>> I know. I know.Can I be mad?
377,00:24:36.77,00:24:36.77,">> Yes, you can be mad.But do you want to come"
378,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,help me find it?>> That is gonna ... us.
379,00:24:41.23,00:24:41.23,>> I know.>> That right there
380,00:24:43.93,00:24:43.93,is gonna ... us.>> I know.

573,00:36:29.77,00:36:29.77,"I don't think we'veever actually sat down,"
574,00:36:31.50,00:36:31.50,"come up with an agenda, andactually followed it through."
575,00:36:34.40,00:36:34.40,"I think there needs to be moreteamwork, more unification."
576,00:36:37.67,00:36:37.67,">> PROBST: So Andrew, when...when you look at this tribe,"
577,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,they sort of appointedyou the leader.
578,00:36:42.97,00:36:42.97,"You know, they sacrifice leadersin some cultures that are as"
579,00:36:45.43,00:36:45.43,decimated as this tribe is.When is this going to change?
580,00:36:48.00,00:36:48.00,Because it isn't goingto get any easier out here.
581,00:36:50.63,00:36:50.63,">> Yeah, I know.It's going to change tomorrow."
582,00:36:52.57,00:36:52.57,We're going to--first thing in the morning--
583,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,finish the floorto where we get a solid sleep.
584,00:36:57.47,00:36:57.47,"No more sleep deprivation,hallucinations,"
585,00:36:59.77,00:36:59.77,mentally shutting down--all that stuff.
586,00:37:01.60,00:37:01.60,And we're just goingto take care of it tomorrow.
587,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"Enough is enough.>> PROBST: Lill, as"
588,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,"a lifelong scoutmaster,assess this tribe."
589,00:37:11.70,00:37:11.70,"If this was yourpack of Boy Scouts,"
590,00:37:14.37,00:37:14.37,how do they rank?I would give them an A+
591,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"for spirit.You have to understand,"
592,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,"the last two challenges, we werethis close to winning."
593,00:37:23.30,00:37:23.30,"I don't think,if the spirit's not there..."
594,00:37:25.63,00:37:25.63,">> PROBST: Whoa. Wait a second.The reward challenge, you guys"
595,00:37:28.37,00:37:28.37,would still be out there.So you weren't close to winning.
596,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,"Assess the tribe.You guys, you aren't sleeping,"
597,00:37:35.43,00:37:35.43,you've lost everychallenge so far.
598,00:37:38.53,00:37:38.53,Give me some truth hereabout the tribe.
599,00:37:40.47,00:37:40.47,"There's a problem somewhere.Where is it,"
600,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,from your point of view?>> The only thing that I think
601,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,that we ought to be doingis maybe fishing a little more.
602,00:37:48.73,00:37:48.73,>> PROBST: That's all you see?Anybody here want
603,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,to own up to the factthat they're a little...
604,00:37:55.63,00:37:55.63,they're a little on edge aboutbeing out here?
605,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,">> Listen, I ain't goingto lie to you."
606,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,"Normally, undernormal circumstances,"
607,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,I would not be here.Absolutely not.
608,00:38:04.20,00:38:04.20,">> PROBST: So, once Survivor isover, however long"
609,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,"you last, you won't anytime soonbe going on another trek?"
610,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,>> Absolutely not.No. No doubt about it.
611,00:38:14.37,00:38:14.37,">> PROBST: Again, you haveto vote somebody"
612,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,out tonight.It's a big vote.
613,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,You can't continueto lose tribe members.
614,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,"So, Lill, what do you basethe vote on tonight?"
615,00:38:25.43,00:38:25.43,"I would base my vote on who has,uh... contributed"
616,00:38:29.97,00:38:29.97,"to the troop--I'm sorry-- to the tribe,"
617,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27,whether or notthey have accepted
618,00:38:37.90,00:38:37.90,"defeat, or did they justgive up and say,"
619,00:38:41.43,00:38:41.43,"""This isn't for me.""That would be what my..."
620,00:38:45.20,00:38:45.20,"my vote would be for.>> PROBST: Andrew, how"
621,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,about for you?It's tough.
622,00:38:48.83,00:38:48.83,What's your vote goingto be based on?
623,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,>> I look for the weakest link.And I... I don't
624,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,care if you're 100 pounds.I don't care
625,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,if you're 250 pounds.Who's bringing the tribe down?
626,00:38:57.33,00:38:57.33,Who's not laying it allon the line
627,00:38:59.53,00:38:59.53,and willing to just go crazyto get it done
628,00:39:02.50,00:39:02.50,"to further the tribe.That's my analysis, and that's"
629,00:39:05.10,00:39:05.10,"how I'm voting tonight.>> PROBST: Ryan, how"
630,00:39:07.07,00:39:07.07,"about for you?>> Uh... normally, I would go"
631,00:39:09.47,00:39:09.47,"for, uh... whateverthe weakest person, uh..."
632,00:39:11.80,00:39:11.80,"physically.But, uh... a person"
633,00:39:14.03,00:39:14.03,"came up to me today and, uh...told me that they..."
634,00:39:17.20,00:39:17.20,"they were ready to go,so that's probably"
635,00:39:19.27,00:39:19.27,what I'm going to base mine on.>> PROBST: So somebody came to
636,00:39:21.67,00:39:21.67,"you today and said they're readyto go, meaning they want"
637,00:39:23.83,00:39:23.83,out of the game?>> Right.
638,00:39:25.80,00:39:25.80,You going to tell mewho that is?
639,00:39:27.83,00:39:27.83,>> Of course not.>> PROBST: We'll see how it
640,00:39:29.77,00:39:29.77,plays out.It is time to vote.
641,00:39:31.73,00:39:31.73,"Andrew, you're first.>> Osten, I think you're great,"
642,00:39:52.90,00:39:52.90,but you gave up on us.You're the one
643,00:39:56.13,00:39:56.13,"who's saying, ""My big burly bodyhas shut down."""
644,00:40:01.97,00:40:01.97,I don't believeit was because of your body.
645,00:40:04.70,00:40:04.70,"So I'm voting for you tonight.>> Ryan, you're a great kid."
646,00:40:20.57,00:40:20.57,You got a bunch of heart.You just don't have
647,00:40:22.63,00:40:22.63,"the strength for this game,and I'll see you"
648,00:40:24.77,00:40:24.77,when I'm out of here.>> You would have never
649,00:40:42.37,00:40:42.37,gotten this vote if you hadn'tasked me to.
650,00:40:51.93,00:40:51.93,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
651,00:41:06.53,00:41:06.53,">> PROBST: Once the votes areread, the decision is final."
652,00:41:09.13,00:41:09.13,The person voted outwill be asked to leave
653,00:41:12.33,00:41:12.33,the Tribal Councilarea immediately.

659,00:41:48.73,00:41:48.73,"Three votes Ryan,two votes Osten."
660,00:41:54.17,00:41:54.17,"The second member voted outof the Morgan Tribe,"
661,00:41:57.33,00:41:57.33,Skinny Ryan.That's four votes.
662,00:41:59.23,00:41:59.23,That's enough.Last vote will remain a mystery.
663,00:42:01.77,00:42:01.77,"You need to bring me your torch.Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
664,00:42:12.77,00:42:12.77,It's time for you to go.>> PROBST: You can head back to
665,00:42:32.63,00:42:32.63,camp-- good night.>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
666,00:42:52.23,00:42:52.23,from our next episode.Next time on Survivor:
667,00:42:59.03,00:42:59.03,>> Osten? He quit.>> There's a big difference
668,00:43:01.17,00:43:01.17,between quittingand pulling the trigger.
669,00:43:03.27,00:43:03.27,">> PROBST: At Drake, the hunt ison."
670,00:43:05.60,00:43:05.60,>> I want to find that treasureso bad.
671,00:43:08.50,00:43:08.50,>> PROBST: And there's troublein paradise.
672,00:43:10.20,00:43:10.20,">> You know what?I can get loud, too!"
673,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00,"What the...?!I can get loud, too!"
674,00:43:13.80,00:43:13.80,>> I don't want to...argue with you!
675,00:43:15.70,00:43:15.70,>> Screw Jon. He's an ass.>> I think I lost
676,00:43:22.70,00:43:22.70,"this game in the, uh...first five minutes"
677,00:43:25.10,00:43:25.10,"I was out here,'cause I didn't make friends"
678,00:43:27.33,00:43:27.33,with the right people.It was really hard
679,00:43:29.27,00:43:29.27,turning things around.I wish I would
680,00:43:30.83,00:43:30.83,have just gone and just tried tobe friends with everybody.
681,00:43:33.03,00:43:33.03,I'm upset that theride's already over.
682,00:43:34.73,00:43:34.73,This is a game Iknow inside and out.
683,00:43:36.47,00:43:36.47,I would have to say that I'mkind of disappointed in myself
684,00:43:38.47,00:43:38.47,and I'm not sure I gave it 100%.Sorry if I let anybody down.
