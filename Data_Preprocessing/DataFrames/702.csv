1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.87,00:00:02.87,"Survivor: Deep in the Pearl Islands,"
3,00:00:05.87,00:00:05.87,16 Americans were surprised by an all-new beginning
4,00:00:08.00,00:00:08.00,to the game. You're going into this game with
5,00:00:10.90,00:00:10.90,"nothing but the clothes you have on your backs, just like"
6,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,"if you really were shipwrecked. Split into two tribes,"
7,00:00:19.77,00:00:19.77,"Morgan and Drake, they were given"
8,00:00:22.47,00:00:22.47,100 Panamanian dollars and a chance to barter
9,00:00:24.97,00:00:24.97,for supplies. >> How much?
10,00:00:27.00,00:00:27.00,>> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe scattered and argued with
11,00:00:28.87,00:00:28.87,the locals. >> Give me my money back.
12,00:00:31.10,00:00:31.10,I don't want it. >> PROBST: The Drakes fared
13,00:00:33.27,00:00:33.27,"better with the help of Sandra, who spoke Spanish..."
14,00:00:35.83,00:00:35.83,">> Aquel me dijo dos Balboa. >> PROBST: ...and Rupert,"
15,00:00:38.00,00:00:38.00,who pirated Morgan's shoes. >> Pirates pillage.
16,00:00:42.30,00:00:42.30,">> PROBST: With their new supplies, the tribes set out"
17,00:00:44.53,00:00:44.53,"for their separate islands. At their camp, the Morgans"
18,00:00:47.50,00:00:47.50,"continued to struggle, this time with shelter"
19,00:00:50.07,00:00:50.07,and water. >> They say we'll go later
20,00:00:52.20,00:00:52.20,"for the water. Personally, we need to do it"
21,00:00:54.63,00:00:54.63,"now. >> PROBST: At Drake,"
22,00:00:56.97,00:00:56.97,"Burton caught the first fish, but Rupert showed him up"
23,00:01:00.20,00:01:00.20,by bringing in a bounty. >> I'm coming out here
24,00:01:02.10,00:01:02.10,to be the caretaker and I think I'm doing it.
25,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50,>> PROBST: At the first immunity challenge...
26,00:01:06.33,00:01:06.33,Survivors ready? Go!
27,00:01:08.20,00:01:08.20,"...it was a close race at the finish,"
28,00:01:10.27,00:01:10.27,but the Drakes pulled off a narrow victory.
29,00:01:13.50,00:01:13.50,Drake wins immunity! The Morgan Tribe blamed
30,00:01:15.60,00:01:15.60,their loss on skinny Ryan. >> That sucked.
31,00:01:18.40,00:01:18.40,"Skinny Ryan, he just hasn't been pulling his weight at camp"
32,00:01:21.10,00:01:21.10,or at the challenge. >> PROBST: And Tijuana got wind
33,00:01:23.27,00:01:23.27,of Nicole's last-minute plotting.
34,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,">> You're not listening. He told me, so I came"
35,00:01:28.43,00:01:28.43,directly to you. >> PROBST: At their first
36,00:01:31.23,00:01:31.23,"tribal council, Nicole's troublemaking caused her to be"
37,00:01:33.47,00:01:33.47,the first person voted out of the Pearl Islands.
38,00:01:36.67,00:01:36.67,"Nicole, the tribe has spoken."
39,00:01:40.07,00:01:40.07,15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:03:17.37,00:03:17.37,">> When it comes time for night, it's breaking us down."
41,00:03:20.20,00:03:20.20,"Um, it's breaking me down, I know."
42,00:03:23.87,00:03:23.87,It's very hard to not be able to sleep.
43,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23,It's very hard to freeze every night.
44,00:03:31.13,00:03:31.13,And there's nothing you can do about it.
45,00:03:33.33,00:03:33.33,The wind is coming... you don't have any control.
46,00:03:35.23,00:03:35.23,It's beating all of us up. It's freezing out here.
47,00:03:39.77,00:03:39.77,>> We need to... we need to get a strong enough fire
48,00:03:42.17,00:03:42.17,that we'll be able to get some heat.
49,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,"I mean, I'm not expecting it to be any Holiday Inn."
50,00:03:48.63,00:03:48.63,"I mean, clearly not. Just shivering every night,"
51,00:03:50.90,00:03:50.90,"that, that, uh... that gets me."
52,00:03:52.97,00:03:52.97,"And I know it's... to me, it seems like it's only"
53,00:03:55.30,00:03:55.30,"a matter of time before, you know,"
54,00:03:57.00,00:03:57.00,something like pneumonia or something like that
55,00:03:58.57,00:03:58.57,"could settle in. 'Cause, I don't have"
56,00:04:00.47,00:04:00.47,any clothes. >> ( sighs ): Good night.
57,00:04:04.50,00:04:04.50,>> Good night. >> Come on.
58,00:04:08.07,00:04:08.07,What's going on here? ( laughing )
59,00:04:11.70,00:04:11.70,A springboard for my head. >> One of my biggest concerns
60,00:04:17.40,00:04:17.40,has been sleep deprivation. We had one to two hours total
61,00:04:20.40,00:04:20.40,"in three nights. And, uh, you know, if we"
62,00:04:23.33,00:04:23.33,"don't solve that problem, people are going"
63,00:04:26.50,00:04:26.50,"to start hallucinating. >> Last night, I don't..."
64,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,"I don't even remember sleeping. You know, I think I'm going"
65,00:04:36.63,00:04:36.63,to be able to go. Once I get a few bottles
66,00:04:38.73,00:04:38.73,"of water in me and a little bit of food,"
67,00:04:40.63,00:04:40.63,I should be fine. But I got to find a plan
68,00:04:43.30,00:04:43.30,"for me, 'cause this isn't working for me."
69,00:04:47.63,00:04:47.63,I'm going to try and come up with a backup plan.
70,00:04:54.30,00:04:54.30,">> Skinny Ryan, his best day doesn't equate to what I can do"
71,00:04:57.60,00:04:57.60,on my worst day. That's no knock on him.
72,00:05:01.33,00:05:01.33,"It's just, physically, he just has nothing to offer."
73,00:05:03.67,00:05:03.67,He just doesn't have what it takes to...
74,00:05:06.23,00:05:06.23,"to get it done. >> Last night was 1,000 times"
75,00:05:19.30,00:05:19.30,better than the night before. >> As far as sleep goes?
76,00:05:23.27,00:05:23.27,>> As far as my whole state of mind.
77,00:05:24.97,00:05:24.97,>> Yeah. >> I am loving life 
78,00:05:28.00,00:05:28.00,and loving this place and loving the position I'm in.
79,00:05:31.70,00:05:31.70,I am in paradise. What more do I want?
80,00:05:36.33,00:05:36.33,I'm living in a bounty of food. I've got beautiful souls
81,00:05:39.87,00:05:39.87,around me. >> You're doing a great job.
82,00:05:43.60,00:05:43.60,">> Oh, you are, too. And I've got some help"
83,00:05:46.77,00:05:46.77,being strong. People are not
84,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,truly lazy per se. People are having a hard time
85,00:05:56.73,00:05:56.73,in paradise. ( laughing )
86,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,>> Just jackass. Did you not learn
87,00:06:07.23,00:06:07.23,how much is in a coconut by now?
88,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,">> There's still a lot in there, but maybe it's like,"
89,00:06:11.30,00:06:11.30,"uh, coconut oil. Maybe it's like suntan lotion."
90,00:06:21.80,00:06:21.80,>> I love being in the middle of a gigantic fish tank.
91,00:06:25.37,00:06:25.37,"I love being able to go out and, in a couple of hours, "
92,00:06:29.03,00:06:29.03,"bring a sack of fish home. >> Okay, Burton..."
93,00:06:44.33,00:06:44.33,>> Yo. >> When it came back
94,00:06:46.30,00:06:46.30,"today, it was... it was kind of loose."
95,00:06:48.40,00:06:48.40,">> Yeah, I tightened it. And when I was"
96,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,"spear-fishing yesterday, this thing fell all the way off."
97,00:06:52.20,00:06:52.20,">> Oh, really? >> Make sure that's always"
98,00:06:54.97,00:06:54.97,"tight, and when you're fishing, check that and make sure"
99,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,that's tight. If we lose that...
100,00:06:59.07,00:06:59.07,>> I try to check in between. >> ...we got no tools
101,00:07:01.50,00:07:01.50,to tighten it with. >> Yeah.
102,00:07:03.20,00:07:03.20,It's more of a pain in the ass for me to give him my spear
103,00:07:06.23,00:07:06.23,"and worry about it being lost or being, you know, broken"
104,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,or whatever where I... then I will be in trouble
105,00:07:12.10,00:07:12.10,because that's my food. I need to eat meat.
106,00:07:15.10,00:07:15.10,">> That's pretty good, huh? >> Man..."
107,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33,>> ( sighs ): I don't know if I can eat anymore.
108,00:07:20.53,00:07:20.53,"This is great. >> Guys, that is yummy."
109,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,">> I'm full. >> Tree mail, tree mail."
110,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,"What, what? The tree mail."
111,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,"Ah, tree mail. Oh, we just got some tree mail."
112,00:07:41.17,00:07:41.17,It's a big one for us. And a super big one for me.
113,00:07:45.83,00:07:45.83,There may not be more pressure for any survivor
114,00:07:48.17,00:07:48.17,in the history of Survivor to do well at a challenge than me.
115,00:07:51.23,00:07:51.23,"""Stormy weather, ran ships aground"
116,00:07:54.47,00:07:54.47,"Most fortunes were lost, A few, they were found"
117,00:07:57.23,00:07:57.23,"Salvage the quickest, silver and gold,"
118,00:08:00.30,00:08:00.30,"You'll then be rewarded like pirates of old."""
119,00:08:03.17,00:08:03.17,( cheering ) >> There's all this talk
120,00:08:06.00,00:08:06.00,about how I didn't give 100% in the last challenge.
121,00:08:09.33,00:08:09.33,"And what really sucks is, I gave more than 100%."
122,00:08:11.47,00:08:11.47,"So now, I've got to come up with some kind of extra,"
123,00:08:14.27,00:08:14.27,extra strength that I may... may not even have harnessed away
124,00:08:18.47,00:08:18.47,"in this poor little body. >> PROBST: Come on in, Drake."
125,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,"Take a spot on your mat. Morgan, come on in."
126,00:08:31.17,00:08:31.17,"Drake, getting your first look at the new Morgan Tribe,"
127,00:08:34.37,00:08:34.37,"minus Nicole, voted out at the first Tribal Council."
128,00:08:38.00,00:08:38.00,Okay. You ready for today's challenge?
129,00:08:40.30,00:08:40.30,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
130,00:08:42.23,00:08:42.23,>> Big time. >> PROBST: It is for a reward
131,00:08:44.17,00:08:44.17,and here's how it works. Scattered along
132,00:08:46.40,00:08:46.40,"the ocean floor, marked by floating buoys,"
133,00:08:49.20,00:08:49.20,"are five treasure items. One at a time,"
134,00:08:52.47,00:08:52.47,"a member from each tribe's going to swim out,"
135,00:08:54.60,00:08:54.60,dive down and retrieve an item. There is also a treasure chest
136,00:08:58.60,00:08:58.60,on the ocean floor. Once your tribe has all five
137,00:09:01.13,00:09:01.13,"items in that chest, and the fifth person"
138,00:09:03.17,00:09:03.17,"is back here at the start, your entire tribe will then race"
139,00:09:06.57,00:09:06.57,"out, return the treasure chest. First tribe to get"
140,00:09:08.83,00:09:08.83,their treasure chest up on the platform wins reward.
141,00:09:11.17,00:09:11.17,Want to know what you're playing for?
142,00:09:13.20,00:09:13.20,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
143,00:09:14.70,00:09:14.70,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: It's two parts.
144,00:09:16.90,00:09:16.90,There's a shovel and a key. These are yours to keep.
145,00:09:19.47,00:09:19.47,>> Yes! >> All right!
146,00:09:21.20,00:09:21.20,>> This is nice. >> PROBST: Buried on each
147,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,of your islands somewhere is a treasure chest
148,00:09:26.47,00:09:26.47,"with enough bounty to last you for a long, long time."
149,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67,"The reward for today's challenge: first clue,"
150,00:09:34.40,00:09:34.40,piece of the map that will lead you to your treasure chest.
151,00:09:37.33,00:09:37.33,This is the first of three clues.
152,00:09:39.13,00:09:39.13,"The winning tribe will also get to loot, that is steal,"
153,00:09:43.47,00:09:43.47,one item from the other tribe's camp.
154,00:09:45.40,00:09:45.40,This will apply to all future tribal reward challenges.
155,00:09:48.13,00:09:48.13,So you have something extra to play for now.
156,00:09:50.70,00:09:50.70,Ready to get this going? >> Yeah.
157,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
158,00:09:54.33,00:09:54.33,">> PROBST: All right, Drake, because you have one extra"
159,00:09:56.97,00:09:56.97,"member, you're sitting somebody out-- who's sitting out?"
160,00:09:59.03,00:09:59.03,"Sandra, take a seat on the bench."
161,00:10:01.13,00:10:01.13,"Guys, take your spot, wait for my ""Go."""
162,00:10:05.03,00:10:05.03,"You guys ready? For reward, survivors ready?"
163,00:10:09.90,00:10:09.90,Go! ( cheering )
164,00:10:16.63,00:10:16.63,">> Come on, Ryan! >> Come on, Ryan."
165,00:10:36.43,00:10:36.43,"( cheering ) >> Come on, Ryan."
166,00:10:43.13,00:10:43.13,">> Come on, Ryan! >> PROBST: Drake with an early"
167,00:10:51.77,00:10:51.77,big lead. >> Go! Go!
168,00:10:53.40,00:10:53.40,( all shouting ) >> Why doesn't he tag out?
169,00:11:07.37,00:11:07.37,">> Come on, Ryan! >> Come on, Ryan!"
170,00:11:20.97,00:11:20.97,"( cheering ) Come on, Ryan!"
171,00:11:23.30,00:11:23.30,>> PROBST: Ryan! You can bring the item
172,00:11:25.23,00:11:25.23,back and tag out! ( yelling )
173,00:11:35.03,00:11:35.03,"You got to take the goblet, put it in the chest,"
174,00:11:38.33,00:11:38.33,then get your item. Ryno decides
175,00:11:41.03,00:11:41.03,"to not take the mask. Drake with two items,"
176,00:11:47.57,00:11:47.57,Morgan still trying to get their first one in the chest.
177,00:12:19.80,00:12:19.80,">> Go, Rupert! >> PROBST: Drake with three"
178,00:12:27.10,00:12:27.10,items. Christa heading for the fourth.
179,00:12:29.17,00:12:29.17,"Morgan with one. >> Come on, Ryno!"
180,00:12:41.00,00:12:41.00,>> PROBST: Christa with another item for Drake.
181,00:12:48.33,00:12:48.33,">> Okay, I got it. >> Yes, Chris, yes!"
182,00:12:50.30,00:12:50.30,">> All right! Let's go! >> Come on, Morgan!"
183,00:13:01.33,00:13:01.33,>> PROBST: Drake needs one more item.
184,00:13:03.87,00:13:03.87,"Burton, you're going to get the bowl to put it in."
185,00:13:06.57,00:13:06.57,"The bowl is your last item. Ryno's worn out, passing off"
186,00:13:10.43,00:13:10.43,"the pearls to Lill. >> PROBST: All seven, go get the"
187,00:13:38.00,00:13:38.00,chest. Lock it up and bring it back.
188,00:13:42.03,00:13:42.03,Morgan's still working on their third item.
189,00:13:44.23,00:13:44.23,">> That's it, Lill, come on. >> All right, let's go get it."
190,00:13:47.07,00:13:47.07,Ready? Three.
191,00:13:57.00,00:13:57.00,>> PROBST: Andrew is heading out to get another item for Morgan.

193,00:14:28.20,00:14:28.20,">> Wait, wait, wait. ( yelling )"
194,00:14:33.03,00:14:33.03,>> PROBST: Open it up. Let's see your items.
195,00:14:35.47,00:14:35.47,You need all five. Drake wins reward!
196,00:14:39.77,00:14:39.77,"( cheering ) >> Whoo, baby!"
197,00:14:42.60,00:14:42.60,"( cheering ) >> One, two, three,"
198,00:14:45.60,00:14:45.60,"Drake! >> PROBST: Drake, great"
199,00:14:47.83,00:14:47.83,"teamwork-- you guys worked together, you had a great plan,"
200,00:14:50.23,00:14:50.23,you didn't give up. Here's the first clue
201,00:14:52.40,00:14:52.40,"to your buried treasure chest. You'll both head back to camp,"
202,00:14:55.43,00:14:55.43,"then Drake, you will decide which member's going"
203,00:14:57.30,00:14:57.30,to give Morgan a visit. And you can help yourself
204,00:15:00.30,00:15:00.30,to one item from their camp. ( cheering )
205,00:15:03.87,00:15:03.87,>> ( chanting ): Drake! Drake! Drake! Drake!
206,00:15:06.37,00:15:06.37,( chanting continues ) >> I'm guessing this
207,00:15:33.40,00:15:33.40,is a third of the map. >> What's the back say?
208,00:15:35.63,00:15:35.63,">> ""There's a treasure buried, so be on your way."
209,00:15:37.53,00:15:37.53,Make sure you leave at the right time of day.
210,00:15:39.83,00:15:39.83,"You'll be heading east, travel by land,"
211,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,"and don't plan to stop when you run out of sand."""
212,00:15:44.53,00:15:44.53,">> So, when they say, ""run out of sand,"""
213,00:15:46.77,00:15:46.77,they're talking about right there where it turns to rock.
214,00:15:49.03,00:15:49.03,>> It's really exciting knowing that there's
215,00:15:50.80,00:15:50.80,treasure out there. We're just...
216,00:15:52.43,00:15:52.43,our hands are tied right now 'cause it's high tide
217,00:15:54.60,00:15:54.60,"and we can't do anything. But as soon as it's low tide,"
218,00:15:56.97,00:15:56.97,we're going to go out there because who knows
219,00:15:59.10,00:15:59.10,"what could be in there. And I'm sure, whatever it is,"
220,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,it could be beneficial. >> We need to figure out who's
221,00:16:03.70,00:16:03.70,going to the camp to take their stuff.
222,00:16:05.80,00:16:05.80,">> Well, I don't know if anyone else is in agreeance,"
223,00:16:07.87,00:16:07.87,but if I could think of one thing we don't have...
224,00:16:10.27,00:16:10.27,"We need a water jug like the one that we ruined,"
225,00:16:12.17,00:16:12.17,because if we could fill that thing up...
226,00:16:14.07,00:16:14.07,">> Also something to keep in mind, though, if..."
227,00:16:15.53,00:16:15.53,if they have more than one water jug
228,00:16:17.63,00:16:17.63,"and if all they have is a tarp, it would be good to hurt them"
229,00:16:21.13,00:16:21.13,"by taking their tarp. >> Honestly, we don't"
230,00:16:22.80,00:16:22.80,need to hurt them. >> You can live by being wet.
231,00:16:25.40,00:16:25.40,>> We don't need to hurt them. >> I'd let Sandra go.
232,00:16:27.93,00:16:27.93,"Okay, cool. >> Sandra, I'm for it."
233,00:16:29.83,00:16:29.83,">> Good. >> No matter who goes,"
234,00:16:31.67,00:16:31.67,"if you're a nice person or not, if you had another tribe member"
235,00:16:34.73,00:16:34.73,"come up to your camp and take something of yours,"
236,00:16:37.67,00:16:37.67,you wouldn't like them either. I was happy that she went
237,00:16:40.60,00:16:40.60,"rather than myself. >> Pirate good, baby."
238,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"Pirate good. >> Oh, my God!"
239,00:16:44.80,00:16:44.80,I can't breathe. ( laughs )
240,00:17:00.37,00:17:00.37,>> They kicked our butts today. And one of the reasons
241,00:17:03.30,00:17:03.30,it hurts so much is because we did so miserably.
242,00:17:06.40,00:17:06.40,We are at a subsistence level right now.
243,00:17:08.70,00:17:08.70,"I mean, we're just getting by. So, when some little punk from"
244,00:17:11.87,00:17:11.87,"Drake comes by here to take one of our items, it doesn't"
245,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,"sound like a big deal. But when you're living this,"
246,00:17:17.10,00:17:17.10,it's huge. >> What if the little
247,00:17:19.60,00:17:19.60,motormouth from Drake says he wants our tarp?
248,00:17:21.63,00:17:21.63,">> Hell, no. Are you-- oh."
249,00:17:26.67,00:17:26.67,"There is no ifs, ands or buts about it-- he takes that tarp,"
250,00:17:29.80,00:17:29.80,I'm going home. I'm not lying.
251,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,"( laughing ) >> So, how y'all doing?"
252,00:18:05.50,00:18:05.50,Are you the ambassador of the Morgan Tribe?
253,00:18:08.33,00:18:08.33,>> I'm the goober of the Morgan Tribe.
254,00:18:10.20,00:18:10.20,>> Why do you say that? I'm Sandra.
255,00:18:11.87,00:18:11.87,>> I'm Ryan. Good job today.
256,00:18:13.73,00:18:13.73,>> You guys doing okay? >> We're doing good.
257,00:18:15.63,00:18:15.63,How are you? >> I'm Sandra.
258,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,>> Congratulations today. >> Sander?
259,00:18:19.77,00:18:19.77,">> Sandra. >> Sandra, Andrew."
260,00:18:21.93,00:18:21.93,>> Ryan. >> Nice to meet you.
261,00:18:23.97,00:18:23.97,This is nice. >> How does it compare
262,00:18:25.83,00:18:25.83,"to your camp? >> Ours is nice, too."
263,00:18:28.13,00:18:28.13,"When I arrived at... at the Morgan Tribe,"
264,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,I could not believe that they...
265,00:18:32.33,00:18:32.33,they just didn't have anything. It's unbelievable.
266,00:18:35.57,00:18:35.57,I don't know how they're getting through.
267,00:18:37.13,00:18:37.13,We managed to buy a lot of stuff
268,00:18:39.50,00:18:39.50,"at the village. I mean, we bought tons"
269,00:18:41.97,00:18:41.97,of stuff at the village. So...
270,00:18:44.90,00:18:44.90,"So, there's more stuff. Where's the rest of it?"
271,00:18:47.87,00:18:47.87,And so I looked around and I went looking
272,00:18:50.30,00:18:50.30,for the water jug. Where the ...
273,00:18:54.60,00:18:54.60,"is the water jug? Well, they had no water jug."
274,00:19:00.13,00:19:00.13,"So I said, ""Wait a minute."" >> Did you make a decision yet?"
275,00:19:02.87,00:19:02.87,>> Yeah. I want that baby up there.
276,00:19:06.17,00:19:06.17,"The tarp. >> Okay, you're going to have"
277,00:19:09.47,00:19:09.47,"to take it down yourself, right? >> Yep."
278,00:19:11.63,00:19:11.63,>> I have to take it down myself?
279,00:19:13.57,00:19:13.57,>> Absolutely. >> Okay.
280,00:19:15.23,00:19:15.23,">> Go ahead. >> Damn, I didn't think"
281,00:19:17.57,00:19:17.57,I'd come out here to work. >> She's going to ruin it.
282,00:19:23.00,00:19:23.00,I'm going to lay it nice and neat
283,00:19:24.63,00:19:24.63,so you guys can fix it back up. I'll be done in a minute and
284,00:19:31.47,00:19:31.47,I'll be out of you guys's hair. In order for me
285,00:19:34.00,00:19:34.00,"to get the tarp, I had to destroy"
286,00:19:35.97,00:19:35.97,"their whole shelter, which I started feeling bad"
287,00:19:37.87,00:19:37.87,until they started running their mouths.
288,00:19:39.87,00:19:39.87,Can I use one of the knives? >> No.
289,00:19:42.07,00:19:42.07,>> These are our knives. >> I go to a grab a knife
290,00:19:44.77,00:19:44.77,"and the black girl's like, ""No, no, no, no, no."
291,00:19:47.07,00:19:47.07,"""You're not going to use our knife"
292,00:19:48.93,00:19:48.93,"and you better not cut our rope."""
293,00:19:50.43,00:19:50.43,"So I was like, ""Okay. Regardless..."
294,00:19:52.63,00:19:52.63,"I'm taking the tarp down."" >> Do what yoygot to do."
295,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,">> Not a problem. >> Don't wreck the shelter,"
296,00:19:57.73,00:19:57.73,"okay? >> No, no, no."
297,00:20:00.00,00:20:00.00,"Hey, I got to do what I got to do,"
298,00:20:02.27,00:20:02.27,"right? >> No, not necessarily."
299,00:20:04.43,00:20:04.43,">> Wrapped around... look, there we go."
300,00:20:06.43,00:20:06.43,It's not that bad. It's all good.
301,00:20:10.63,00:20:10.63,"But look, it's coming apart fairly easy."
302,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,>> Sandra came over and she was just...
303,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,I don't know. That whole tribe is just...
304,00:20:20.57,00:20:20.57,is a bunch of ( bleep ). I didn't do
305,00:20:22.53,00:20:22.53,any unnecessary harm. You guys will have this up
306,00:20:26.07,00:20:26.07,"in no time, I'm sure. >> She acted like she was nice"
307,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,about taking the tarp. But I think she was a little bit
308,00:20:31.23,00:20:31.23,too snatchy about it and tore it down
309,00:20:33.33,00:20:33.33,kind of on purpose. >> You don't know how good you
310,00:20:36.53,00:20:36.53,"have it until you see others. Well, you guys sleep tight."
311,00:20:39.83,00:20:39.83,"Don't let the bed bugs bite. And, uh, no hard feelings"
312,00:20:42.63,00:20:42.63,"and I'll see you guys tomorrow, okay? Take care."
313,00:20:44.57,00:20:44.57,>> Bye-bye. She's such a bitch.
314,00:20:51.43,00:20:51.43,>> Andrew... it's getting dark. >> I know.
315,00:20:56.00,00:20:56.00,>> Let's... ( thunder rumbling )
316,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,>> We all need to get in the shelter.
317,00:21:16.93,00:21:16.93,>> But I'm going to help with the shelter.
318,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,We're gonna get this all done first.
319,00:21:20.53,00:21:20.53,>> We'll have time to talk after that.
320,00:21:22.20,00:21:22.20,">> All right, we're going to get this all done first."
321,00:21:24.37,00:21:24.37,>> Everyone was devastated by the loss of our tarp
322,00:21:26.50,00:21:26.50,and Osten was throwing in the towel.
323,00:21:28.43,00:21:28.43,He was finished. He was ready to walk off.
324,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,"We need people around that are on the ups,"
325,00:21:33.13,00:21:33.13,that are digging this game. And this is great stuff.
326,00:21:36.13,00:21:36.13,"We don't need people just walking around,"
327,00:21:37.90,00:21:37.90,"""I don't... I want to go home,"" you know."
328,00:21:40.57,00:21:40.57,It's a real morale-killer for the tribe.
329,00:21:45.10,00:21:45.10,">> Well, let's look at the reality here."
330,00:21:47.40,00:21:47.40,There's so many things and aspects to the game.
331,00:21:50.40,00:21:50.40,"When it comes down to it, it's mental."
332,00:21:53.10,00:21:53.10,">> I'm in here in shorts, and it's gonna be raining and cold."
333,00:21:55.53,00:21:55.53,"I'm gonna get sick, and I could"
334,00:21:57.37,00:21:57.37,potentially get pneumonia; I've gotten it before.
335,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,I'm just not gonna... I just don't feel
336,00:22:00.97,00:22:00.97,"that-that I need that. >> Yeah, but you're saying"
337,00:22:02.80,00:22:02.80,you-you may be. You don't know.
338,00:22:04.30,00:22:04.30,">> I will be at the end of this, tonight."
339,00:22:07.00,00:22:07.00,>> Osten had mentioned to me that he was potentially thinking
340,00:22:09.33,00:22:09.33,about quitting. And I just wanted to talk
341,00:22:11.30,00:22:11.30,to him in a calm fashion and truly understand
342,00:22:13.60,00:22:13.60,and then give him my personal opinion.
343,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,My opinion is that you're giving up.
344,00:22:18.60,00:22:18.60,"You would be a loss, not only for us,"
345,00:22:21.70,00:22:21.70,but for me. We're here in this together.
346,00:22:27.60,00:22:27.60,"I'm just asking you just to try, at least."
347,00:22:30.10,00:22:30.10,>> All right. >> And that means
348,00:22:32.27,00:22:32.27,being here tonight throughout the
349,00:22:33.67,00:22:33.67,whole night. >> All right.
350,00:22:36.40,00:22:36.40,I'm gonna let that marinate a little bit.
351,00:22:42.23,00:22:42.23,>> I think I'm done now. I've made my peace;
352,00:22:44.60,00:22:44.60,"I've said what I needed to say. It's up to him,"
353,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,what he wants to do. Only he knows
354,00:22:50.13,00:22:50.13,what's best for him. >> It's impossible.
355,00:23:29.40,00:23:29.40,You can't even swim out there. >> Really?
356,00:23:32.87,00:23:32.87,"You see anything cool? >> Went fishing,"
357,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,"to catch some fish, and I was out there in the, um,"
358,00:23:38.07,00:23:38.07,"heavy tides and the currents. Shot the spear, and, um,"
359,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,"the tip winded up coming off and, um,"
360,00:23:43.70,00:23:43.70,either got lodged under a rock or is swirling around somewhere
361,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,in the tide. But I just couldn't swim
362,00:23:49.87,00:23:49.87,"anymore, so I had to come back in"
363,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37,"and break the news. Yeah, we have a problem."
364,00:23:55.20,00:23:55.20,>> What's wrong? >> This. My spear is dead.
365,00:24:04.60,00:24:04.60,Where is the spear? You didn't even get it?
366,00:24:07.23,00:24:07.23,It'll go to the bottom. >> I looked all over.
367,00:24:09.83,00:24:09.83,"The tide's so hard, it keeps whipping me"
368,00:24:11.97,00:24:11.97,"back out to sea. >> The current was so strong,"
369,00:24:16.00,00:24:16.00,"and it was throwing him into the rocks, and..."
370,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,"Now, remember this is in our little inlet"
371,00:24:20.23,00:24:20.23,where it's a bathtub. He couldn't find the spearhead.
372,00:24:23.53,00:24:23.53,He gives up. That's why I wanted...
373,00:24:25.77,00:24:25.77,"that's why I was... >> I kept tightening it, too."
374,00:24:28.07,00:24:28.07,I wanted to be the only one that did that.
375,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,You lost my bag and you killed my spear.
376,00:24:33.43,00:24:33.43,>> And I didn't do it on purpose.
377,00:24:35.03,00:24:35.03,>> I know. I know. Can I be mad?
378,00:24:36.77,00:24:36.77,">> Yes, you can be mad. But do you want to come"
379,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,help me find it? >> That is gonna ... us.
380,00:24:41.23,00:24:41.23,>> I know. >> That right there
381,00:24:43.93,00:24:43.93,is gonna ... us. >> I know.
382,00:24:45.33,00:24:45.33,"Trust me, I know. That's why I've been looking"
383,00:24:47.87,00:24:47.87,"for the last hour. I had a little mishap, and"
384,00:24:51.43,00:24:51.43,"I lost the tip of the spear. When I confronted Rupert,"
385,00:24:54.03,00:24:54.03,"he kind of freaked out a little because he, you know,"
386,00:24:56.40,00:24:56.40,"he got attached to that as well. That became his little thing,"
387,00:24:59.20,00:24:59.20,"you know, catching fish. And I was pretty upset about it"
388,00:25:01.57,00:25:01.57,"because, you know, I do care about"
389,00:25:03.07,00:25:03.07,"what others think, of course, and I know how"
390,00:25:05.00,00:25:05.00,certain people feel. >> That is our meat.
391,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,"That is our best meat source. >> Well, can we just"
392,00:25:09.30,00:25:09.30,"make a pact, then, not for Shawn to go"
393,00:25:11.37,00:25:11.37,fishing with the spear? >> Oh...!
394,00:25:13.33,00:25:13.33,">> No, I mean, I don't know how to go spearfishing."
395,00:25:16.53,00:25:16.53,"If you would try, you know, like everyone else,"
396,00:25:18.93,00:25:18.93,"then, you know, it's a chance you're gonna lose something."
397,00:25:21.63,00:25:21.63,"I mean, you know? It's try or not try."
398,00:25:24.43,00:25:24.43,>> Shawn is the biggest puss I have ever met in my entire life.
399,00:25:28.13,00:25:28.13,">> But I say, as a tribe, we go out there and try and find it."
400,00:25:31.00,00:25:31.00,">> Absolutely. >> I mean, I don't mind"
401,00:25:33.23,00:25:33.23,going back out by myself. >> That is more...
402,00:25:35.47,00:25:35.47,That is as important to me as that damn treasure chest.
403,00:25:38.47,00:25:38.47,"My spear is gone, the head is gone."
404,00:25:40.87,00:25:40.87,There's no more meat. There's no more meat.
405,00:25:45.13,00:25:45.13,They're talking about tying the damn fork off to it.
406,00:25:52.30,00:25:52.30,He could not even tell me where he lost it at.
407,00:25:56.17,00:25:56.17,So I go out and I start doing a grid pattern.
408,00:26:01.30,00:26:01.30,"I start from the trees, start from where I know he wasn't,"
409,00:26:05.43,00:26:05.43,"and on my grid pattern, I'd do about a size"
410,00:26:08.40,00:26:08.40,of a football field. You're looking
411,00:26:10.47,00:26:10.47,at a general area that's five or six
412,00:26:12.53,00:26:12.53,football fields. >> Yes!
413,00:26:30.97,00:26:30.97,>> Where was it? >> In the ocean!
414,00:26:34.37,00:26:34.37,>> Where in the ocean? ( laughing )
415,00:26:38.13,00:26:38.13,>> I am so happy. Yes...!
416,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43,Drake...! I feel better.
417,00:26:48.30,00:26:48.30,I stopped yelling and screaming at him and cussing at him
418,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,and calling him bad names. Do they know we found it?
419,00:26:53.67,00:26:53.67,>> I think they heard you yell and they assumed.
420,00:26:56.00,00:26:56.00,"( laughing ) They assume you did,"
421,00:26:57.70,00:26:57.70,but I had to come and confirm. >> I know finding that spear
422,00:27:01.50,00:27:01.50,made him feel better. If we hadn't have
423,00:27:04.47,00:27:04.47,"found the spear, he, for sure, would have been"
424,00:27:06.83,00:27:06.83,"done, done, done. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
425,00:27:21.13,00:27:21.13,Welcome. You guys doing all right?
426,00:27:23.30,00:27:23.30,>> Yep. >> Great!
427,00:27:24.90,00:27:24.90,>> Doing good. >> PROBST: First things first.
428,00:27:27.00,00:27:27.00,Let me ask about the looting-- who ended up going over
429,00:27:29.33,00:27:29.33,from Drake? >> I went over.
430,00:27:30.90,00:27:30.90,>> PROBST: How'd it feel to be a pirate?
431,00:27:33.40,00:27:33.40,">> It felt good to be a pirate. >> PROBST: Just remember,"
432,00:27:36.27,00:27:36.27,"payback can be painful. Okay, give me back"
433,00:27:39.30,00:27:39.30,"the Immunity Idol. Immunity, back up for grabs."
434,00:27:48.37,00:27:48.37,"Win immunity, your tribe is safe from Tribal Council"
435,00:27:50.67,00:27:50.67,"for another three days. For today's challenge,"
436,00:27:53.53,00:27:53.53,three tribe members from each tribe
437,00:27:55.37,00:27:55.37,will become prisoners for the other tribe.
438,00:27:58.13,00:27:58.13,One person will have their hands tied.
439,00:27:59.63,00:27:59.63,They will be on a raft leaning against a pole.
440,00:28:01.87,00:28:01.87,The other two will be draped across the raft--
441,00:28:04.30,00:28:04.30,"their hands will be tied. Using a rope-and-pulley system,"
442,00:28:07.20,00:28:07.20,the other four members from the opposing tribe
443,00:28:09.87,00:28:09.87,"will pull as fast as they can, taking you out to sea."
444,00:28:14.00,00:28:14.00,"Meanwhile, the guy on the raft is untying his hands"
445,00:28:16.83,00:28:16.83,"as quickly as he can. Once he's untied himself,"
446,00:28:19.87,00:28:19.87,he can then untie the other two tribe members
447,00:28:22.47,00:28:22.47,"who are draped across the raft. When you're all three untied,"
448,00:28:25.53,00:28:25.53,"you swim back to shore,"
449,00:28:27.00,00:28:27.00,bringing with you two ropes and the bamboo chute
450,00:28:29.53,00:28:29.53,which is tied to your raft. Inside that bamboo chute
451,00:28:32.37,00:28:32.37,are compass points. Go inside the compass ring.
452,00:28:35.77,00:28:35.77,You'll use the compass points and your two ropes.
453,00:28:38.13,00:28:38.13,Where the ropes intersect is a tribe flag.
454,00:28:40.20,00:28:40.20,"Dig down, get it up and get it in its sleeve."
455,00:28:44.17,00:28:44.17,The first tribe to raise their tribe flag
456,00:28:46.13,00:28:46.13,and have all members with a hand on the flag wins immunity.
457,00:28:49.47,00:28:49.47,"Drake, you're sitting somebody out-- esterday it was Sandra;"
458,00:28:52.50,00:28:52.50,"today it's Christa. Everybody else strategize,"
459,00:28:54.57,00:28:54.57,"wait for my ""go."" All right, the prisoners"
460,00:28:59.53,00:28:59.53,"for the Drake Tribe, Rupert, Michelle and Trish,"
461,00:29:02.53,00:29:02.53,will be pulled out to sea by the Morgan Tribe.
462,00:29:04.63,00:29:04.63,"Andrew, Ryno and Darrah, you'll be pulled out"
463,00:29:06.60,00:29:06.60,by the Drake Tribe-- immunity at stake.
464,00:29:08.53,00:29:08.53,Survivors ready? >> Ready.
465,00:29:10.87,00:29:10.87,">> PROBST: Go! >> Let's go, let's go."
466,00:29:17.73,00:29:17.73,>> PROBST: It's a race to see who can get untied first
467,00:29:21.63,00:29:21.63,"and back to shore. >> PROBST: That a way to pull,"
468,00:29:43.37,00:29:43.37,Morgan! Andrew and Rupert
469,00:29:50.27,00:29:50.27,are both untied. They're trying to untie
470,00:29:52.57,00:29:52.57,their teammates. It's gonna be a race
471,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70,back to shore. Keep pulling.
472,00:29:57.27,00:29:57.27,">> Keep going, guys. >> Here's mine."
473,00:30:06.33,00:30:06.33,>> PROBST: Andrew's got everybody done-- he's going for
474,00:30:08.90,00:30:08.90,the bamboo chute. >> Pull! Pull!
475,00:30:12.77,00:30:12.77,>> PROBST: Andrew trying to untie the clue.
476,00:30:14.97,00:30:14.97,Rupert has his clue. Both tribe members are free.
477,00:30:19.60,00:30:19.60,Morgan swimming in. Bring your ropes.
478,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,Morgan swimming in. >> Go!
479,00:30:31.10,00:30:31.10,>> Let's go! You guys are doing it!
480,00:30:34.03,00:30:34.03,You guys are doing it! Let's go!
481,00:30:36.23,00:30:36.23,>> PROBST: Morgan comes ashore with a huge lead.
482,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,"All right, give me the coordinates."
483,00:30:42.23,00:30:42.23,>> PROBST: Go! Start solving it.
484,00:30:45.30,00:30:45.30,Get in the ring. >> Let's go!
485,00:30:51.10,00:30:51.10,"Come on, run, run! You guys got it!"
486,00:30:53.13,00:30:53.13,Good job! >> Nobody panic.
487,00:30:55.80,00:30:55.80,>> PROBST: Everybody's got to get here first.
488,00:30:58.87,00:30:58.87,>> Come on! >> Let's go!
489,00:31:00.90,00:31:00.90,">> PROBST: That a way, be patient."
490,00:31:03.20,00:31:03.20,Morgan struggling to get their coordinates open.
491,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,>> Get to your coordinates. >> You got it.
492,00:31:09.77,00:31:09.77,Morgan still trying to get their clue open.
493,00:31:14.27,00:31:14.27,Drake has their first coordinate.
494,00:31:16.13,00:31:16.13,>> Down here. Northwest to east.
495,00:31:19.67,00:31:19.67,>> Northwest south. >> PROBST: Morgan finally has
496,00:31:23.83,00:31:23.83,their clue open. Find the intersect!
497,00:31:25.47,00:31:25.47,Dig! Start digging!
498,00:31:28.40,00:31:28.40,>> Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
499,00:31:38.27,00:31:38.27,>> PROBST: Don't quit. Dig deep.
500,00:31:40.23,00:31:40.23,">> Let's go, guys. Let's go!"
501,00:31:42.53,00:31:42.53,>> PROBST: Drake has their flag out.
502,00:31:44.83,00:31:44.83,">> Pick it up! Come on, you guys!"
503,00:31:50.60,00:31:50.60,>> Here we go! >> Plug it in!
504,00:31:58.13,00:31:58.13,( cheering ) >> PROBST: Drake wins immunity!
505,00:32:00.07,00:32:00.07,">> Yeah! ( cheering, shouting )"
506,00:32:04.13,00:32:04.13,">> Oh, yeah! >> PROBST: Great effort."
507,00:32:09.27,00:32:09.27,"Drake, once again, immunity going back to camp."
508,00:32:13.97,00:32:13.97,"( cheering ) >> Okay, guys, touch it."
509,00:32:17.47,00:32:17.47,Touch it. >> PROBST: Next time I see you
510,00:32:23.10,00:32:23.10,guys will be at Tribal Council. You can head back to camp.
511,00:32:25.77,00:32:25.77,See you in a while. >> We lost immunity challenge
512,00:32:58.83,00:32:58.83,today. Tribal Council tonight.
513,00:33:02.93,00:33:02.93,"Tribe's pretty devastated, actually."
514,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,"Of course, the critical decision tonight"
515,00:33:10.00,00:33:10.00,is who's going to go? Who's leaving the Morgan Tribe?
516,00:33:13.10,00:33:13.10,"( thunder rumbling ) >> At first,"
517,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,"when Osten told me that he wanted to quit,"
518,00:33:34.53,00:33:34.53,"I was really shocked. But then,"
519,00:33:36.20,00:33:36.20,"the more I thought about it, the more it made sense."
520,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,This is a game where you've got to have your whole heart
521,00:33:41.30,00:33:41.30,into this and it just doesn't seem like he's got it.
522,00:33:44.07,00:33:44.07,It's only day six. >> What's happening?
523,00:33:47.43,00:33:47.43,>> It's between Skinny Ryan and me.
524,00:33:49.03,00:33:49.03,">> Huh? If you're gone, we got no hope."
525,00:33:57.50,00:33:57.50,"If you think about Osten's strength,"
526,00:33:59.47,00:33:59.47,"his physical strength is huge. We can't compete with,"
527,00:34:02.27,00:34:02.27,"you know, Grizzly Adams, and those other two horses."
528,00:34:05.57,00:34:05.57,Without Osten? It's impossible.
529,00:34:07.63,00:34:07.63,"I mean, it's clear over here."
530,00:34:09.50,00:34:09.50,The clouds are going this way.
531,00:34:11.47,00:34:11.47,>> Enough's enough. Feel like...
532,00:34:13.07,00:34:13.07,sleep out in the cold just until I get pneumonia?
533,00:34:15.93,00:34:15.93,"Just to win a million dollars? And, if I don't win it,"
534,00:34:18.83,00:34:18.83,"then I got fluid in my lungs, potentially, blood in my lungs."
535,00:34:21.90,00:34:21.90,It doesn't matter who you are. You have no control
536,00:34:24.30,00:34:24.30,over your body. If your body wants to make
537,00:34:26.67,00:34:26.67,"you stop, you're stopping. >> You know what?"
538,00:34:29.40,00:34:29.40,"Osten didn't win, so he wants to quit."
539,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,How fair is that? Osten's excuse was
540,00:34:36.63,00:34:36.63,his body was giving out. I saw him on the beach.
541,00:34:39.70,00:34:39.70,"He's running up and down, throwing coconuts,"
542,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,"lifting logs, playing. There's nothing wrong"
543,00:34:45.43,00:34:45.43,with his body. That's a piss-poor
544,00:34:47.90,00:34:47.90,"attitude, isn't it? >> Uh-huh."
545,00:34:50.80,00:34:50.80,">> He just got beat, and he couldn't take being beat."
546,00:34:53.47,00:34:53.47,>> Did Osten come to you and talk to you?
547,00:34:56.00,00:34:56.00,">> He came up to me and asked me, face-to-face,"
548,00:34:58.87,00:34:58.87,"""Would you please vote for me tonight?"""
549,00:35:00.77,00:35:00.77,>> He told you that tonight? >> Yeah.
550,00:35:03.03,00:35:03.03,"Like, I'd say, less than 30 minutes ago."
551,00:35:05.27,00:35:05.27,>> I was personally upset and disappointed with Osten
552,00:35:07.73,00:35:07.73,for quitting. I just can't understand.
553,00:35:09.90,00:35:09.90,"I just can't fathom it. >> You mean, vote myself off?"
554,00:35:14.43,00:35:14.43,"I thought about it, yeah, but I don't know yet."
555,00:35:18.53,00:35:18.53,">> He has what it takes, in my opinion."
556,00:35:20.60,00:35:20.60,That's what pisses me off. It's because I care about him.
557,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,"How can you cut yourself short? You know, you got here."
558,00:35:26.03,00:35:26.03,"When it comes down to it, if that's the decision"
559,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"that he makes, then it is his heart that's not here."
560,00:35:31.27,00:35:31.27,"And if that's the case, he would have to go."
561,00:35:57.20,00:35:57.20,>> PROBST: Here we go again. I know you guys don't
562,00:36:01.23,00:36:01.23,"want to be back here. So, Andrew, what are"
563,00:36:04.53,00:36:04.53,"the camp issues right now? >> Still sleeping, Jeff."
564,00:36:08.30,00:36:08.30,The floor of our shelter is still
565,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,not as comfortable as it needs to be.
566,00:36:12.07,00:36:12.07,We had to rebuild the whole roof because
567,00:36:13.90,00:36:13.90,"Sandra from the Drake Tribe came and, uh..."
568,00:36:15.63,00:36:15.63,"took our tarp, which was our whole roof."
569,00:36:17.40,00:36:17.40,>> PROBST: But Sandra took the tarp yesterday.
570,00:36:19.30,00:36:19.30,So what did you do for the first five days? Ryan?
571,00:36:21.90,00:36:21.90,"I mean, what's going on? This is the second time"
572,00:36:24.23,00:36:24.23,at Tribal Council we've talked about sleep issues.
573,00:36:26.77,00:36:26.77,">> Uh, I... I think we're kind of hurting in focus."
574,00:36:29.77,00:36:29.77,"I don't think we've ever actually sat down,"
575,00:36:31.50,00:36:31.50,"come up with an agenda, and actually followed it through."
576,00:36:34.40,00:36:34.40,"I think there needs to be more teamwork, more unification."
577,00:36:37.67,00:36:37.67,">> PROBST: So Andrew, when... when you look at this tribe,"
578,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,they sort of appointed you the leader.
579,00:36:42.97,00:36:42.97,"You know, they sacrifice leaders in some cultures that are as"
580,00:36:45.43,00:36:45.43,decimated as this tribe is. When is this going to change?
581,00:36:48.00,00:36:48.00,Because it isn't going to get any easier out here.
582,00:36:50.63,00:36:50.63,">> Yeah, I know. It's going to change tomorrow."
583,00:36:52.57,00:36:52.57,We're going to-- first thing in the morning--
584,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,finish the floor to where we get a solid sleep.
585,00:36:57.47,00:36:57.47,"No more sleep deprivation, hallucinations,"
586,00:36:59.77,00:36:59.77,mentally shutting down-- all that stuff.
587,00:37:01.60,00:37:01.60,And we're just going to take care of it tomorrow.
588,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"Enough is enough. >> PROBST: Lill, as"
589,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,"a lifelong scoutmaster, assess this tribe."
590,00:37:11.70,00:37:11.70,"If this was your pack of Boy Scouts,"
591,00:37:14.37,00:37:14.37,how do they rank? I would give them an A+
592,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"for spirit. You have to understand,"
593,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,"the last two challenges, we were this close to winning."
594,00:37:23.30,00:37:23.30,"I don't think, if the spirit's not there..."
595,00:37:25.63,00:37:25.63,">> PROBST: Whoa. Wait a second. The reward challenge, you guys"
596,00:37:28.37,00:37:28.37,would still be out there. So you weren't close to winning.
597,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,"Assess the tribe. You guys, you aren't sleeping,"
598,00:37:35.43,00:37:35.43,you've lost every challenge so far.
599,00:37:38.53,00:37:38.53,Give me some truth here about the tribe.
600,00:37:40.47,00:37:40.47,"There's a problem somewhere. Where is it,"
601,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,from your point of view? >> The only thing that I think
602,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,that we ought to be doing is maybe fishing a little more.
603,00:37:48.73,00:37:48.73,>> PROBST: That's all you see? Anybody here want
604,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,to own up to the fact that they're a little...
605,00:37:55.63,00:37:55.63,they're a little on edge about being out here?
606,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,">> Listen, I ain't going to lie to you."
607,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,"Normally, under normal circumstances,"
608,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,I would not be here. Absolutely not.
609,00:38:04.20,00:38:04.20,">> PROBST: So, once Survivor is over, however long"
610,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,"you last, you won't anytime soon be going on another trek?"
611,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,>> Absolutely not. No. No doubt about it.
612,00:38:14.37,00:38:14.37,">> PROBST: Again, you have to vote somebody"
613,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,out tonight. It's a big vote.
614,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,You can't continue to lose tribe members.
615,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,"So, Lill, what do you base the vote on tonight?"
616,00:38:25.43,00:38:25.43,"I would base my vote on who has, uh... contributed"
617,00:38:29.97,00:38:29.97,"to the troop-- I'm sorry-- to the tribe,"
618,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27,whether or not they have accepted
619,00:38:37.90,00:38:37.90,"defeat, or did they just give up and say,"
620,00:38:41.43,00:38:41.43,"""This isn't for me."" That would be what my..."
621,00:38:45.20,00:38:45.20,"my vote would be for. >> PROBST: Andrew, how"
622,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,about for you? It's tough.
623,00:38:48.83,00:38:48.83,What's your vote going to be based on?
624,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,>> I look for the weakest link. And I... I don't
625,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,care if you're 100 pounds. I don't care
626,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,if you're 250 pounds. Who's bringing the tribe down?
627,00:38:57.33,00:38:57.33,Who's not laying it all on the line
628,00:38:59.53,00:38:59.53,and willing to just go crazy to get it done
629,00:39:02.50,00:39:02.50,"to further the tribe. That's my analysis, and that's"
630,00:39:05.10,00:39:05.10,"how I'm voting tonight. >> PROBST: Ryan, how"
631,00:39:07.07,00:39:07.07,"about for you? >> Uh... normally, I would go"
632,00:39:09.47,00:39:09.47,"for, uh... whatever the weakest person, uh..."
633,00:39:11.80,00:39:11.80,"physically. But, uh... a person"
634,00:39:14.03,00:39:14.03,"came up to me today and, uh... told me that they..."
635,00:39:17.20,00:39:17.20,"they were ready to go, so that's probably"
636,00:39:19.27,00:39:19.27,what I'm going to base mine on. >> PROBST: So somebody came to
637,00:39:21.67,00:39:21.67,"you today and said they're ready to go, meaning they want"
638,00:39:23.83,00:39:23.83,out of the game? >> Right.
639,00:39:25.80,00:39:25.80,You going to tell me who that is?
640,00:39:27.83,00:39:27.83,>> Of course not. >> PROBST: We'll see how it
641,00:39:29.77,00:39:29.77,plays out. It is time to vote.
642,00:39:31.73,00:39:31.73,"Andrew, you're first. >> Osten, I think you're great,"
643,00:39:52.90,00:39:52.90,but you gave up on us. You're the one
644,00:39:56.13,00:39:56.13,"who's saying, ""My big burly body has shut down."""
645,00:40:01.97,00:40:01.97,I don't believe it was because of your body.
646,00:40:04.70,00:40:04.70,"So I'm voting for you tonight. >> Ryan, you're a great kid."
647,00:40:20.57,00:40:20.57,You got a bunch of heart. You just don't have
648,00:40:22.63,00:40:22.63,"the strength for this game, and I'll see you"
649,00:40:24.77,00:40:24.77,when I'm out of here. >> You would have never
650,00:40:42.37,00:40:42.37,gotten this vote if you hadn't asked me to.
651,00:40:51.93,00:40:51.93,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
652,00:41:06.53,00:41:06.53,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
653,00:41:09.13,00:41:09.13,The person voted out will be asked to leave
654,00:41:12.33,00:41:12.33,the Tribal Council area immediately.
655,00:41:14.63,00:41:14.63,I'll read the votes. First vote:
656,00:41:22.07,00:41:22.07,Osten. Skinny Ryan.
657,00:41:34.07,00:41:34.07,Osten. Two votes Osten.
658,00:41:37.23,00:41:37.23,One vote Ryan. Ryan.
659,00:41:41.70,00:41:41.70,"That's two votes Ryan, two votes Osten."
660,00:41:48.73,00:41:48.73,"Three votes Ryan, two votes Osten."
661,00:41:54.17,00:41:54.17,"The second member voted out of the Morgan Tribe,"
662,00:41:57.33,00:41:57.33,Skinny Ryan. That's four votes.
663,00:41:59.23,00:41:59.23,That's enough. Last vote will remain a mystery.
664,00:42:01.77,00:42:01.77,"You need to bring me your torch. Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
665,00:42:12.77,00:42:12.77,It's time for you to go. >> PROBST: You can head back to
666,00:42:32.63,00:42:32.63,camp-- good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
667,00:42:52.23,00:42:52.23,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:
668,00:42:59.03,00:42:59.03,>> Osten? He quit. >> There's a big difference
669,00:43:01.17,00:43:01.17,between quitting and pulling the trigger.
670,00:43:03.27,00:43:03.27,">> PROBST: At Drake, the hunt is on."
671,00:43:05.60,00:43:05.60,>> I want to find that treasure so bad.
672,00:43:08.50,00:43:08.50,>> PROBST: And there's trouble in paradise.
673,00:43:10.20,00:43:10.20,">> You know what? I can get loud, too!"
674,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00,"What the...?! I can get loud, too!"
675,00:43:13.80,00:43:13.80,>> I don't want to... argue with you!
676,00:43:15.70,00:43:15.70,>> Screw Jon. He's an ass. >> I think I lost
677,00:43:22.70,00:43:22.70,"this game in the, uh... first five minutes"
678,00:43:25.10,00:43:25.10,"I was out here, 'cause I didn't make friends"
679,00:43:27.33,00:43:27.33,with the right people. It was really hard
680,00:43:29.27,00:43:29.27,turning things around. I wish I would
681,00:43:30.83,00:43:30.83,have just gone and just tried to be friends with everybody.
682,00:43:33.03,00:43:33.03,I'm upset that the ride's already over.
683,00:43:34.73,00:43:34.73,This is a game I know inside and out.
684,00:43:36.47,00:43:36.47,I would have to say that I'm kind of disappointed in myself
685,00:43:38.47,00:43:38.47,and I'm not sure I gave it 100%. Sorry if I let anybody down.
