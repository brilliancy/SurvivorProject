4,00:00:15.87,00:00:15.87,"to rescue people in dangerous, life threatening situations."
5,00:00:19.90,00:00:19.90,"Today, however, we have a different mission."
6,00:00:22.53,00:00:22.53,These 16 Americans are about to be abandoned.
7,00:00:25.97,00:00:25.97,This plane will land in the heart of one of the most
8,00:00:28.47,00:00:28.47,unforgiving places anywhere on earth: the Australian outback.
9,00:00:32.67,00:00:32.67,"For the next 42 days, they'll be left to fend for themselves,"
10,00:00:35.20,00:00:35.20,forced to work together to create a new society while
11,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77,battling the elements and each other.
12,00:00:41.57,00:00:41.57,"They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted from the tribe."
13,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,"In the end, one will remain and will claim the million-dollar"

18,00:02:44.13,00:02:44.13,a lifetime. They have never spoken to each
19,00:02:47.10,00:02:47.10,"other, and the rules state they must remain quiet until after"
20,00:02:50.63,00:02:50.63,"the plane has landed, dropped them off, and abandoned them."
21,00:02:56.03,00:02:56.03,They have been separated into two competing tribes: Kucha and
22,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83,Ogakor. One crate of supplies awaits
23,00:03:01.90,00:03:01.90,"each tribe, and once the plane has taken off, they will have"
24,00:03:05.57,00:03:05.57,only five minutes to salvage whatever they can carry.
25,00:03:09.20,00:03:09.20,They then face a grueling 5-mile hike that will take them deep
26,00:03:12.60,00:03:12.60,into the outback and their new homes for the next 42 days.

104,00:07:20.63,00:07:20.63,"like, ""I can't stand, uh, Debb."" >> DEBB: See, if we're going"
105,00:07:23.87,00:07:23.87,"southwest, how are we going to hit the dry creek bed?"

111,00:07:36.67,00:07:36.67,make me crazy. >> MARALYN: When you traverse

117,00:08:10.83,00:08:10.83,Maralyn? That trek let me know that this
118,00:08:14.10,00:08:14.10,was for real. That was a long trek we had
119,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,"through deep sand with a lot of heavy equipment, and I was"
120,00:08:20.43,00:08:20.43,"packing more weight than anyone else, so I was really"
121,00:08:23.17,00:08:23.17,"struggling. It was a long trip, and that"
122,00:08:26.27,00:08:26.27,"was... that fired me up, because that is the quickest way to find"
123,00:08:29.90,00:08:29.90,out what people are made of. >> AMBER: ( groans )
124,00:08:35.73,00:08:35.73,I'm a little tired. This rice is very heavy.
125,00:08:39.47,00:08:39.47,I really want to get there soon. >> COLBY: We don't know how far
126,00:08:45.87,00:08:45.87,"away we are, so I'm going to run up this and do a little"
127,00:08:48.30,00:08:48.30,"reconnaissance, see if we can't find out where we're at."
128,00:08:50.07,00:08:50.07,"I figure if it's really far, we'll drape some of our stuff"
129,00:08:52.07,00:08:52.07,"here, and we won't take it. If we're not far, then we'll"
130,00:08:54.37,00:08:54.37,"buck up and get it there. Yeah, I'm going to keep going."
131,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,"We're just going to follow the creek bed here, and, uh, make"
132,00:08:58.83,00:08:58.83,"sure if it looks like it's getting too dark, you turn back"
133,00:09:02.00,00:09:02.00,and come get us. >> JERRI: Keith actually ran
134,00:09:05.50,00:09:05.50,"ahead to go scout out where the camp was, 'cause we were all"
135,00:09:08.00,00:09:08.00,"getting pretty tired, and the last leg of that walk was really"
136,00:09:12.27,00:09:12.27,difficult. >> COLBY: I wish the snakes
137,00:09:32.37,00:09:32.37,would... >> MARALYN: Never let 'em see

146,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70,"weak, and, um, on the verge of throwing up just ever since I"
147,00:10:13.30,00:10:13.30,"got here. I mean, it started with the"
148,00:10:15.37,00:10:15.37,"plane flight. In the beginning, it was really"
149,00:10:17.70,00:10:17.70,"fun, and it was kind of cool and groovy, and I was enjoying the"
150,00:10:20.90,00:10:20.90,"ride, and then all of a sudden, I just got sort of nauseous, and"
151,00:10:23.50,00:10:23.50,"I kept thinking to myself, 'I'm not going to get sick."

153,00:10:28.87,00:10:28.87,"So I sort of went into this little zone and breathed, and I"
154,00:10:32.13,00:10:32.13,don't remember any of it. >> KIMMI: Rodger carried one of
155,00:10:38.60,00:10:38.60,the big water jugs. Mike had a big water jug.
156,00:10:41.50,00:10:41.50,"Poor Elisabeth had the board on her head, and then I had the"
157,00:10:43.83,00:10:43.83,"eight bottled waters wrapped around me, so the-the four of"
158,00:10:47.13,00:10:47.13,us kind of got separated from the other four when we were
159,00:10:49.73,00:10:49.73,"walking to our campground. >> ELISABETH: I mean, everything"
160,00:10:54.97,00:10:54.97,was heavy to carry. You can't discount any of our
161,00:10:56.80,00:10:56.80,"equipment as easy to carry, but some of it was just more"
162,00:10:59.00,00:10:59.00,"awkward. And some of the crossings, we"
163,00:11:01.87,00:11:01.87,"had to go, you know, down a sharp valley of rocks. and up"
164,00:11:04.33,00:11:04.33,"again, and kind of wind and balance across a river."
165,00:11:07.63,00:11:07.63,"And it was frustrating, too, but with the water jugs and, you"
166,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50,"know, the water canteens, and... I mean, that stuff is just"
167,00:11:13.43,00:11:13.43,"awkward. >> Oh, I see the flag."
168,00:11:30.83,00:11:30.83,"Oh, my God! Welcome to our home."
169,00:11:34.37,00:11:34.37,">> Right up there. >> KIMMI: When we arrived, it"
170,00:11:36.73,00:11:36.73,"was just a moment of ecstasy, 'cause it's like, ""Yes!"

172,00:11:42.33,00:11:42.33,"I mean... And not just physically from here, but just"
173,00:11:44.73,00:11:44.73,"mentally preparing yourself the whole journey, like, all the"
174,00:11:48.20,00:11:48.20,"airplane flights from New York to California to Australia, from"
175,00:11:50.80,00:11:50.80,the other part of Australia to here to there.
176,00:11:53.00,00:11:53.00,"You know, there were just so many things in sequence to get"
177,00:11:55.60,00:11:55.60,you to that flag that just being at that flag is just an
178,00:11:57.70,00:11:57.70,accomplishment. ( yelling )

181,00:12:34.50,00:12:34.50,There's no shelter here at all. >> ELISABETH: As soon as we got
182,00:12:36.77,00:12:36.77,"out of the river, I think we just... this kind of"
183,00:12:38.47,00:12:38.47,"realization. We got a little cold, and we"
184,00:12:40.37,00:12:40.37,"realized that we're going to... we have to sleep somewhere, and"
185,00:12:42.87,00:12:42.87,we just wanted to feel a little safe and dry.
186,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,So we got to work as much as we could on building the basis of a
187,00:12:49.03,00:12:49.03,home. >> DEBB: We got enough rocks
188,00:12:52.23,00:12:52.23,"here, too! We could build a pretty decent"

190,00:12:59.27,00:12:59.27,It's going to make is softer to sleep on.

192,00:13:03.27,00:13:03.27,snakes in there. >> MICHAEL: When we started
193,00:13:07.80,00:13:07.80,"building the shelter, I thought everybody started chipping in,"
194,00:13:09.47,00:13:09.47,"because there was the wood gatherers, and there was the"
195,00:13:12.57,00:13:12.57,"people that were building, and, uh, I had worked a lot of, uh,"
196,00:13:16.60,00:13:16.60,"you know, some construction in my life, and I-I had a"
197,00:13:19.13,00:13:19.13,"reasonable sense of, uh, of-of construction."
198,00:13:22.33,00:13:22.33,What we're going to have to do is just cut little holes in
199,00:13:24.13,00:13:24.13,"here, and then just tie it around the top here about this"
200,00:13:26.47,00:13:26.47,"high, so that we can just make it right here."
201,00:13:32.70,00:13:32.70,"Um, we need one to go right about halfway up along this"
202,00:13:35.87,00:13:35.87,support right here. >> DEBB: It seems like one
203,00:13:37.83,00:13:37.83,"individual in the group is... ordering everybody around, and"
204,00:13:42.73,00:13:42.73,"if you guys haven't figured it out, it's Mike."

216,00:14:06.87,00:14:06.87,"telling him how to build it, and-and Rodger was like, ""No,"
217,00:14:10.27,00:14:10.27,"that isn't going to work."" >> RODGER: It's going to give us"

441,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,"is the most important thing. We need to... beat, beat, beat"
442,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,the other tribe. We'll let them eliminate someone
443,00:25:49.80,00:25:49.80,on their team first. >> MITCHELL: This immunity
444,00:25:53.10,00:25:53.10,"challenge is extremely important, because we have to"
445,00:25:55.47,00:25:55.47,"show the other team that we're better, you know, and plus, we"

451,00:26:21.17,00:26:21.17,"smoke. >> JEFF: All right, I got"
452,00:26:23.10,00:26:23.10,something that's going to help the smoke.
453,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60,Waterproof matches. One of the things we're playing
454,00:26:26.87,00:26:26.87,"for tonight, right here, a little canister full."
455,00:26:29.60,00:26:29.60,We're also playing for something else much more important than
456,00:26:31.93,00:26:31.93,waterproof matches. Right here: the immunity idol.
457,00:26:36.40,00:26:36.40,"You want to know this guy really well, because the tribe that"
458,00:26:39.67,00:26:39.67,wins the immunity idol will not have to go to Tribal Council and
459,00:26:42.67,00:26:42.67,vote out one of their own members.
460,00:26:44.80,00:26:44.80,That brings us to challenge number one.
461,00:26:46.80,00:26:46.80,You're playing for fire. You're playing for immunity.
462,00:26:49.57,00:26:49.57,There are four legs in the race. You'll be carrying a lit torch.
463,00:26:52.33,00:26:52.33,If somebody falls in the water at any time and their torch goes
464,00:26:54.73,00:26:54.73,"out, your tribe is done. Somebody's going home tomorrow."
465,00:26:57.70,00:26:57.70,So that is key. Here's how the game is played.
466,00:27:00.83,00:27:00.83,First leg starts at the old bridge.
467,00:27:03.43,00:27:03.43,You'll make your way across using two planks to help you
468,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,"bridge the gaps. On the second leg, you'll cross"
469,00:27:08.97,00:27:08.97,"over the island, where you'll find, in the water, a small"
470,00:27:11.03,00:27:11.03,torch-carrying raft. Put your lighted torch on the
471,00:27:14.30,00:27:14.30,"raft and, as a tribe, swim across to the other side of the"
472,00:27:16.33,00:27:16.33,"bank. When you get over there, you'll"
473,00:27:19.83,00:27:19.83,find two sets of wooden rungs. Take them with you.
474,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,"For the third leg, you're going to get on another raft, and"
475,00:27:25.50,00:27:25.50,"using a rope, pull yourself across the river."
476,00:27:28.70,00:27:28.70,"Using the rungs, climb up the ladder, light the torch."
477,00:27:31.93,00:27:31.93,"Winners: maybe a hot meal tonight, security of knowing"
478,00:27:34.27,00:27:34.27,"you're going to be here a while. Losers: cold, somebody's going"
479,00:27:38.03,00:27:38.03,to be the first person voted out of the tribe.
480,00:27:40.37,00:27:40.37,"Make sense? Let's take our spots, wait for"
481,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50,"my start. Let's go. All right, at stake, fire... and"
482,00:27:56.47,00:27:56.47,"immunity! Survivors, ready?!"
483,00:27:59.77,00:27:59.77,>> Ready! >> JEFF: Go!

486,00:28:25.50,00:28:25.50,"Go, go, go! >> This is a team."
487,00:28:34.77,00:28:34.77,"This is a team. >> Go, go, go, go, let's go."
488,00:28:44.27,00:28:44.27,"We got it. >> NICK: Go, go."
489,00:28:54.10,00:28:54.10,"Help her a little. Help. Go, go, go."

492,00:29:14.53,00:29:14.53,">> Let's go. >> Come on, come on!"
493,00:29:21.50,00:29:21.50,">> ALICIA: Let's go, let's go. >> Put your hand on the raft,"

518,00:32:11.27,00:32:11.27,I know you're already a close group.
519,00:32:12.60,00:32:12.60,It's going to be a tough decision.
520,00:32:14.23,00:32:14.23,You guys can head on back to camp.
521,00:32:15.87,00:32:15.87,"Ogakor, you guys can light this up in celebration."

524,00:32:58.47,00:32:58.47,I think probably more so emotionally.

526,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,"we have to go to, uh, I don't think any of us are looking"

533,00:33:30.17,00:33:30.17,"down to, like, me, Rodger or maybe, um... Jeff, because he"
534,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,hasn't been feeling good. My personal opinion is the
535,00:33:37.47,00:33:37.47,strong survive. If you were going to vote for

550,00:34:11.27,00:34:11.27,thought of it. >> RODGER: Yeah.
551,00:34:12.43,00:34:12.43,>> DEBB: He's like... he wants a pizza and a coke.
552,00:34:13.77,00:34:13.77,">> RODGER: He-he might've... >> ALICIA: She said, ""He's"
553,00:34:15.60,00:34:15.60,"falling apart, doesn't feel good."""
554,00:34:17.87,00:34:17.87,"I was like, ""Yeah, okay."" >> JEFF V.: Are you kidding me?"
555,00:34:19.00,00:34:19.00,">> ALICIA: No, I'm not kidding you."
556,00:34:20.27,00:34:20.27,I wouldn't tell you that if she didn't say it.
557,00:34:21.97,00:34:21.97,>> JEFF V.: It's like there's a part of me that's a little
558,00:34:23.77,00:34:23.77,paranoid about who's talking to who.
559,00:34:25.47,00:34:25.47,"I see these two standing over across, um... Mike and Rodger"
560,00:34:29.27,00:34:29.27,standing across the river talking.
561,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,They're not fishing. They're not doing anything.
562,00:34:33.77,00:34:33.77,"They're just talking, and uh, the wheels start turning, and"
563,00:34:36.07,00:34:36.07,just... my eyes are going around.
564,00:34:37.90,00:34:37.90,">> MICHAEL: I mean, it's two different games, you know?"
565,00:34:39.90,00:34:39.90,>> JEFF V.: Just because we've said what we're doing doesn't
566,00:34:41.60,00:34:41.60,"necessarily mean it's going to happen, and I haven't been with"
567,00:34:44.60,00:34:44.60,these people long enough to know for sure how well...
568,00:34:48.67,00:34:48.67,"I mean, I'm not going to trust anybody, but there's a"
569,00:34:50.93,00:34:50.93,"certain... to a certain point, you have to."
570,00:34:53.17,00:34:53.17,>> JEFF V.: I puked on camera. How embarrassing.
571,00:34:55.70,00:34:55.70,>> MICHAEL: You puked? >> DEBB: Couple times already.
572,00:34:58.27,00:34:58.27,>> MICHAEL: Did you save it? >> DEBB: Would you stop?
573,00:35:01.30,00:35:01.30,( laughing ) >> KIMMI: It's like going to
574,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,court. Tribal Council is going to
575,00:35:16.57,00:35:16.57,"court. Nobody likes to go to court,"
576,00:35:19.03,00:35:19.03,"you know, but if you broke the law, you got to go, and we broke"
577,00:35:21.27,00:35:21.27,"the law by not winning. So we, you know, we got to go"
578,00:35:23.97,00:35:23.97,face our punishment. Our punishment... is to get rid
579,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87,of one of our own. >> MICHAEL: The people that I
580,00:35:40.27,00:35:40.27,"think that are in jeopardy tonight are potentially Jeff,"
581,00:35:44.07,00:35:44.07,"because of the health issues, and Rodger might not be safe."
582,00:35:48.37,00:35:48.37,"He could be a liability in the challenges, and especially"
583,00:35:53.20,00:35:53.20,swimming challenges and climbing challenges.
584,00:35:55.30,00:35:55.30,And it's not just Rodger. It would be anybody over 50
585,00:35:57.03,00:35:57.03,"years old. >> JEFF V.: I mean, I-I'm"
586,00:36:00.73,00:36:00.73,"looking forward to voting somebody out, 'cause it's the"
587,00:36:02.77,00:36:02.77,"game, and I'm here to play the game."
588,00:36:04.80,00:36:04.80,I'm not here to make friends. I'm not here for that.
589,00:36:06.93,00:36:06.93,"People have got to go, and I look forward to walking up,"
590,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,writing somebody's name on a card and talking about 'em.
591,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,( laughs ) Um... I'm getting ready to do
592,00:36:13.57,00:36:13.57,"it. >> JEFF: Guys, come on in."
593,00:36:37.63,00:36:37.63,We begin your first Tribal Council with a ritual.
594,00:36:41.80,00:36:41.80,Behind each of you is a torch. Grab a torch and approach a
595,00:36:43.87,00:36:43.87,flame. Dip your torches in and... get
596,00:36:51.67,00:36:51.67,"some fire, put 'em back in their slots."
597,00:36:53.80,00:36:53.80,We do this because fire does represent life here.
598,00:36:58.30,00:36:58.30,"These torches will now represent your life, your identity at"
599,00:37:00.63,00:37:00.63,Tribal Council. You'll bring these torches with
600,00:37:04.27,00:37:04.27,"you to each Tribal Council, and the good news is when you return"
601,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,"home tonight, you will have fire."
602,00:37:15.50,00:37:15.50,"Before we get into this, I just want you guys to take a second"
603,00:37:18.67,00:37:18.67,and look around at where we're at.
604,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,We're on top of a granite waterfall.
605,00:37:25.40,00:37:25.40,Can't think of a more spectacular place for the drama
606,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,that's going to go down here every three days.
607,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,This is where you account for your actions.
608,00:37:34.53,00:37:34.53,Some of those actions tonight are going to help you.
609,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,Going to stay here a few more days.
610,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,Some of those actions may come back to haunt you.
611,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,One thing's for certain. One of you guys will be the
612,00:37:43.87,00:37:43.87,first person voted out of a tribe.
613,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,"So before we get to that, let's do a little gauge in how the"
614,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"first few days were. Debb, what about finding the"
615,00:37:52.03,00:37:52.03,camp? Was it a celebration or was it
616,00:37:54.73,00:37:54.73,"fall down, ""I'm exhausted""? >> DEBB: Celebration."
617,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,Celebration. It was celebration all the way
618,00:37:58.90,00:37:58.90,in. Hop in the water and then regret
619,00:38:01.63,00:38:01.63,it afterwards when we were freezing and had no fire.
620,00:38:04.27,00:38:04.27,">> JEFF: Yeah, let's talk a little about that. Fire."
621,00:38:06.60,00:38:06.60,You've-you've been one really trying to get this fire going.
622,00:38:09.33,00:38:09.33,"Yeah, I been the one trying and getting no fire."
623,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"I mean, I've tried everything those damn books said to do."
624,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,"The bow, the-the... this thing. That's crazy."
625,00:38:17.80,00:38:17.80,">> JEFF: Well, you'll have fire tonight when you go home."
626,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,">> DEBB: Yeah, yeah. That's good to know."
627,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,It's been a little cold a couple nights here.
628,00:38:25.23,00:38:25.23,>> JEFF: Have you guys formed any impressions about the other
629,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,tribe in the limited time you've seen them?
630,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,">> MICHAEL: We haven't really had a lot of contact with them,"
631,00:38:33.53,00:38:33.53,"but, uh, right now, we totally see them as the enemy."
632,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,We haven't had a chance to bond with them.
633,00:38:38.27,00:38:38.27,We haven't had a chance to talk with them at all.
634,00:38:40.03,00:38:40.03,I didn't even look at 'em when we lost.
635,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,">> NICK: Yesterday's event was just a physical challenge, and I"
636,00:38:43.47,00:38:43.47,"would've put money on us any day to win that challenge, but they"
637,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,"went through, and then we had problems."
638,00:38:49.67,00:38:49.67,">> JEFF: Rodger, leadership come up?"
639,00:38:51.50,00:38:51.50,"Did anybody emerge as a leader? >> RODGER: Uh, yes."
640,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,"I would say probably, uh, Mike has."
641,00:38:58.00,00:38:58.00,"Uh, uh, as far as building the hut, I think we both probably"
642,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,"shared in on that, 'cause my knowledge on that is pretty"
643,00:39:04.13,00:39:04.13,"extensive in-in that I teach a carpentry class, and, uh..."
644,00:39:08.10,00:39:08.10,"But overall, I'd say he's probably taken the lead, and-and"
645,00:39:10.77,00:39:10.77,"that's fine, 'cause he's a very knowledgeable person."
646,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,We all... we all get along great.
647,00:39:14.90,00:39:14.90,"Tonight is, uh, really a hard deal for us."
648,00:39:17.53,00:39:17.53,"Uh, personally, I-I thought that the first vote off would be"
649,00:39:21.20,00:39:21.20,"easy, because you would probably have somebody that would be"
650,00:39:23.63,00:39:23.63,"slacking, but we just haven't had that."
651,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,"I mean, every one of these people have worked and worked"
652,00:39:28.20,00:39:28.20,"hard, and that's-that's what makes tonight's vote so hard."
653,00:39:31.60,00:39:31.60,">> JEFF: All right, it's time to vote."
654,00:39:33.93,00:39:33.93,"Here's how it's going to work. One by one, you guys will go"
655,00:39:36.50,00:39:36.50,across the bridge to the voting confessional.
656,00:39:39.23,00:39:39.23,You'll write down in big clear letters the name of the person
657,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,"you're voting for, hold it up, speak your peace-- why you're"
658,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70,"voting the way you're voting-- then fold it up, put it in the"
659,00:39:49.30,00:39:49.30,"voting container, come back and have a seat."
660,00:39:52.57,00:39:52.57,"Make sense? We'll start here with you, Debb."
661,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,"You're up. >> DEBB: I love this guy dearly,"
662,00:40:14.77,00:40:14.77,but I came here deciding that I was going to vote on the
663,00:40:18.10,00:40:18.10,strongest surviving. Jeff's been the sickest of all
664,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,"of us, and he's still not over it, so I'm going to vote for"
665,00:40:24.57,00:40:24.57,"Jeff, and I hate to do it. I love him."
666,00:40:43.10,00:40:43.10,">> RODGER: No real reason, actually."
667,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,"She's as hard a worker as anybody out there, and, uh..."
668,00:40:48.97,00:40:48.97,somebody had to go. >> KIMMI: I'm voting for Debb
669,00:41:28.63,00:41:28.63,"because... she's a great worker and everything, but she does"
670,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,"feel isolated. You know, when we're together"
671,00:41:35.60,00:41:35.60,"all in the tent at night, she just chooses... to be"
672,00:41:39.67,00:41:39.67,"independent, and... she's just a strong-willed person."
673,00:41:44.10,00:41:44.10,It's not a bad thing. It's just not what I need.
674,00:41:55.13,00:41:55.13,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
675,00:42:22.83,00:42:22.83,"I need to remind you that once the votes are tallied, the"
676,00:42:25.30,00:42:25.30,decision is final. The person will be asked to
677,00:42:28.27,00:42:28.27,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
678,00:42:30.77,00:42:30.77,You'll do so across this bridge here.
679,00:42:33.70,00:42:33.70,"Take the bridge up, over the rocks, down to a confessional"
680,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,where you can speak as long as you want about your time here in
681,00:42:40.60,00:42:40.60,the Outback. I'll read the votes.
682,00:42:47.03,00:42:47.03,First vote... Debb.
683,00:42:57.57,00:42:57.57,Debb. Jeff.
684,00:43:09.13,00:43:09.13,"Debb. Four votes for Debb, one vote"
685,00:43:16.53,00:43:16.53,for Jeff. First person voted out of the
686,00:43:23.93,00:43:23.93,tribe... is Debb. No point in revealing the other
687,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40,two votes. You need to bring your torch.
688,00:43:33.43,00:43:33.43,">> DEBB: Do good. Kick ... >> JEFF: Over here, Debb."
689,00:43:41.33,00:43:41.33,The tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go.
690,00:43:51.40,00:43:51.40,">> KIMMI: Good-bye, Debb. >> JEFF: You survived your first"
691,00:44:02.93,00:44:02.93,Tribal Council. Grab your torches.
692,00:44:05.60,00:44:05.60,"You'll have fire. Head back to camp,"
693,00:44:07.77,00:44:07.77,I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our
694,00:44:30.20,00:44:30.20,"next episode. Next time on Survivor, Kel is"
695,00:44:35.63,00:44:35.63,accused of smuggling food. >> MITCHELL: Jerri blatantly
696,00:44:38.87,00:44:38.87,said that she saw something that looked just like beef jerky.
697,00:44:41.77,00:44:41.77,">> KEL: It was a blade of grass, and I was chewing on that."
698,00:44:44.03,00:44:44.03,>> JERRI: It was nowhere near any grass.
699,00:44:46.30,00:44:46.30,>> JEFF: Kimmi struggles with the immunity challenge.
700,00:44:48.10,00:44:48.10,( screams ) You got cow brain there.
701,00:44:50.87,00:44:50.87,>> KIMMI: I can't eat a brain. >> You're good.
702,00:44:54.00,00:44:54.00,>> DEBB: I wouldn't have minded getting voted off if I had
703,00:44:55.80,00:44:55.80,"fell... fallen during a competition, if I was lazy, if I"
704,00:44:59.40,00:44:59.40,"wasn't a team player, but when I come here, and I give all of"
705,00:45:03.20,00:45:03.20,"that, and I still get voted off, I bet you if Jeff had read every"
706,00:45:06.53,00:45:06.53,"one of those votes, it would have been seven to one, and"
707,00:45:09.13,00:45:09.13,that's-that's a shame. I still thought a lot of it
708,00:45:11.50,00:45:11.50,"boiled down to mental toughness and physical ability, and none"
709,00:45:15.10,00:45:15.10,of that even mattered.
