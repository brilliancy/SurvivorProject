602,00:37:18.67,00:37:18.67,and look around at where we'reat.
603,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,We're on top of a granitewaterfall.
604,00:37:25.40,00:37:25.40,Can't think of a morespectacular place for the drama
605,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,that's going to go down hereevery three days.
606,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,This is where you account foryour actions.
607,00:37:34.53,00:37:34.53,Some of those actions tonightare going to help you.

609,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,Some of those actions may comeback to haunt you.
610,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,One thing's for certain.One of you guys will be the
611,00:37:43.87,00:37:43.87,first person voted out of atribe.
612,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,"So before we get to that, let'sdo a little gauge in how the"
613,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"first few days were.Debb, what about finding the"
614,00:37:52.03,00:37:52.03,camp?Was it a celebration or was it
615,00:37:54.73,00:37:54.73,"fall down, ""I'm exhausted""?>> DEBB: Celebration."
616,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,Celebration.It was celebration all the way
617,00:37:58.90,00:37:58.90,in.Hop in the water and then regret
618,00:38:01.63,00:38:01.63,it afterwards when we werefreezing and had no fire.
619,00:38:04.27,00:38:04.27,">> JEFF: Yeah, let's talk alittle about that. Fire."
620,00:38:06.60,00:38:06.60,You've-you've been one reallytrying to get this fire going.
621,00:38:09.33,00:38:09.33,"Yeah, I been the one trying andgetting no fire."
622,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"I mean, I've tried everythingthose damn books said to do."
623,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,"The bow, the-the... this thing.That's crazy."
624,00:38:17.80,00:38:17.80,">> JEFF: Well, you'll have firetonight when you go home."

626,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,It's been a little cold a couplenights here.
627,00:38:25.23,00:38:25.23,>> JEFF: Have you guys formedany impressions about the other
628,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,tribe in the limited time you'veseen them?
629,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,">> MICHAEL: We haven't reallyhad a lot of contact with them,"
630,00:38:33.53,00:38:33.53,"but, uh, right now, we totallysee them as the enemy."
631,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,We haven't had a chance to bondwith them.
632,00:38:38.27,00:38:38.27,We haven't had a chance to talkwith them at all.
633,00:38:40.03,00:38:40.03,I didn't even look at 'em whenwe lost.
634,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,">> NICK: Yesterday's event wasjust a physical challenge, and I"
635,00:38:43.47,00:38:43.47,"would've put money on us any dayto win that challenge, but they"
636,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,"went through, and then we hadproblems."
637,00:38:49.67,00:38:49.67,">> JEFF: Rodger, leadership comeup?"
638,00:38:51.50,00:38:51.50,"Did anybody emerge as a leader?>> RODGER: Uh, yes."
639,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,"I would say probably, uh, Mikehas."
640,00:38:58.00,00:38:58.00,"Uh, uh, as far as building thehut, I think we both probably"
641,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,"shared in on that, 'cause myknowledge on that is pretty"
642,00:39:04.13,00:39:04.13,"extensive in-in that I teach acarpentry class, and, uh..."
643,00:39:08.10,00:39:08.10,"But overall, I'd say he'sprobably taken the lead, and-and"
644,00:39:10.77,00:39:10.77,"that's fine, 'cause he's a veryknowledgeable person."
645,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,We all... we all get alonggreat.
646,00:39:14.90,00:39:14.90,"Tonight is, uh, really a harddeal for us."
647,00:39:17.53,00:39:17.53,"Uh, personally, I-I thought thatthe first vote off would be"
648,00:39:21.20,00:39:21.20,"easy, because you would probablyhave somebody that would be"
649,00:39:23.63,00:39:23.63,"slacking, but we just haven'thad that."
650,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,"I mean, every one of thesepeople have worked and worked"
651,00:39:28.20,00:39:28.20,"hard, and that's-that's whatmakes tonight's vote so hard."
652,00:39:31.60,00:39:31.60,">> JEFF: All right, it's time tovote."
653,00:39:33.93,00:39:33.93,"Here's how it's going to work.One by one, you guys will go"
654,00:39:36.50,00:39:36.50,across the bridge to the votingconfessional.
655,00:39:39.23,00:39:39.23,You'll write down in big clearletters the name of the person

657,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70,"voting the way you're voting--then fold it up, put it in the"
658,00:39:49.30,00:39:49.30,"voting container, come back andhave a seat."
659,00:39:52.57,00:39:52.57,"Make sense?We'll start here with you, Debb."
660,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,"You're up.>> DEBB: I love this guy dearly,"
661,00:40:14.77,00:40:14.77,but I came here deciding that Iwas going to vote on the
662,00:40:18.10,00:40:18.10,strongest surviving.Jeff's been the sickest of all
663,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,"of us, and he's still not overit, so I'm going to vote for"
664,00:40:24.57,00:40:24.57,"Jeff, and I hate to do it.I love him."
665,00:40:43.10,00:40:43.10,">> RODGER: No real reason,actually."

667,00:40:48.97,00:40:48.97,somebody had to go.>> KIMMI: I'm voting for Debb
668,00:41:28.63,00:41:28.63,"because... she's a great workerand everything, but she does"
669,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,"feel isolated.You know, when we're together"
670,00:41:35.60,00:41:35.60,"all in the tent at night, shejust chooses... to be"
671,00:41:39.67,00:41:39.67,"independent, and... she's just astrong-willed person."
672,00:41:44.10,00:41:44.10,It's not a bad thing.It's just not what I need.
673,00:41:55.13,00:41:55.13,>> JEFF: I'll go tally thevotes.
674,00:42:22.83,00:42:22.83,"I need to remind you that oncethe votes are tallied, the"
675,00:42:25.30,00:42:25.30,decision is final.The person will be asked to

677,00:42:30.77,00:42:30.77,You'll do so across this bridgehere.
678,00:42:33.70,00:42:33.70,"Take the bridge up, over therocks, down to a confessional"
679,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,where you can speak as long asyou want about your time here in
680,00:42:40.60,00:42:40.60,the Outback.I'll read the votes.

703,00:44:59.40,00:44:59.40,"wasn't a team player, but when Icome here, and I give all of"
704,00:45:03.20,00:45:03.20,"that, and I still get voted off,I bet you if Jeff had read every"
705,00:45:06.53,00:45:06.53,"one of those votes, it wouldhave been seven to one, and"
706,00:45:09.13,00:45:09.13,that's-that's a shame.I still thought a lot of it
707,00:45:11.50,00:45:11.50,"boiled down to mental toughnessand physical ability, and none"
708,00:45:15.10,00:45:15.10,of that even mattered.
