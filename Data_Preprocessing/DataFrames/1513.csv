193,00:11:20.12,00:11:20.12,"I'm being left out ofeverything, so..."
194,00:11:26.96,00:11:26.96,">> PROBST: Amanda, how youfeeling?"
195,00:11:28.29,00:11:28.29,">> Yeah, it's not a goodfeeling, you know, but, I mean,"
196,00:11:30.92,00:11:30.92,"what can do you?>> PROBST: Not much, because I"
197,00:11:34.29,00:11:34.29,"got nothing for you.>> I'm sorry, guys."
198,00:11:37.17,00:11:37.17,">> PROBST: Denise, Todd,Courtney, you will fly to the"
199,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"Great Wall of China, have a nicemeal, spend the night."
200,00:11:42.00,00:11:42.00,"Great reward, enjoy it, get yourstuff, head out."
201,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,>> Just me and you.>> Yeah.
202,00:12:05.96,00:12:05.96,">> I'm pissed.After the challenge, I"
203,00:12:08.17,00:12:08.17,"definitely lost my cool, youknow, said some things that I"
204,00:12:10.75,00:12:10.75,probably shouldn't have.It's just frustrating.
205,00:12:13.29,00:12:13.29,"I mean, I picked Denise for areward, and to have her win"
206,00:12:16.12,00:12:16.12,"twice now and not pick me, it'stough."
207,00:12:18.50,00:12:18.50,"And then also I heard her say,""I don't want Peih-Gee getting"
208,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,"any stronger.""That part makes me mad, because"
209,00:12:24.50,00:12:24.50,"it's like, hello, I'm still aperson."
210,00:12:39.96,00:12:39.96,">> Everything is so much work,as it is, and then, like, having"
211,00:12:43.83,00:12:43.83,"to do it all just sucks.Don't screw this up, Amanda."
212,00:12:51.21,00:12:51.21,"It's coming down to, like, theend of the game, and three"
213,00:12:54.29,00:12:54.29,"people are having meals andeating, and I used to be one of"
214,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,"those three, and now I'm not.So it's... it's hard."
215,00:13:03.92,00:13:03.92,Why is it you dislike me somuch?
216,00:13:05.88,00:13:05.88,>> Huh?>> Why do you dislike me so
217,00:13:07.12,00:13:07.12,"much?>> I don't dislike you, Amanda,"
218,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,seriously.>> Because it's like ever since
219,00:13:12.08,00:13:12.08,"you came here, like, you haven'treally talked to me at all, and,"
220,00:13:15.25,00:13:15.25,"like, at tribal, I feel likeyou're always attacking me."
221,00:13:19.29,00:13:19.29,">> I mean, I'm sorry.Like, honestly, like, I'm sorry"
222,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"that, like... if it hurts yourfeelings or anything like that."
223,00:13:23.79,00:13:23.79,"It's really...>> No, I just want to know,"
224,00:13:25.08,00:13:25.08,"because I'd like to get it...I'd like to get it out, like..."
225,00:13:28.29,00:13:28.29,">> Yeah, no, actually, I'm gladthat, like, we get some time to"
226,00:13:30.50,00:13:30.50,"spend together, because, like...>> I am, too, actually."
227,00:13:32.12,00:13:32.12,">> Like, I, like... we reallyhaven't had a lot of time to"
228,00:13:34.54,00:13:34.54,"talk, and, like, I think it'scool that we get to... you know,"
229,00:13:36.75,00:13:36.75,get to know each other a littlebetter.
230,00:13:38.12,00:13:38.12,">> Yeah, me, too.>> I actually respect Amanda for"
231,00:13:39.83,00:13:39.83,speaking her mind.I think we had some just
232,00:13:43.17,00:13:43.17,miscommunication with her makingassumptions of me and me making
233,00:13:47.08,00:13:47.08,"assumptions of her, and it'sbecause we hadn't had a chance"
234,00:13:50.38,00:13:50.38,to really sit down and talk.>> There's one.
235,00:13:54.88,00:13:54.88,>> Awesome.>> Right there.
236,00:14:01.21,00:14:01.21,"There's one.>> Ooh, that was a huge one."
237,00:14:03.62,00:14:03.62,>> I know.>> Awesome.
238,00:14:05.88,00:14:05.88,">> Yay, we have food.Oh, we just found a huge Asian"
239,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,"pear and huge limes, so we'rereally happy, because we have"
240,00:14:13.12,00:14:13.12,food to eat.Yay!
241,00:14:16.17,00:14:16.17,Life doesn't suck right now.>> Whoo-hoo!
242,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,>> You guys are awesome.>> How cool is this?
243,00:14:28.88,00:14:28.88,I'm so grateful you picked me.Peih-Gee we can't feed right now
244,00:14:31.21,00:14:31.21,"because...>> No, I can't give her"
245,00:14:33.00,00:14:33.00,anything.And I feel bad.
246,00:14:34.42,00:14:34.42,"She was like, ""I'm not going tovote for you now,"" and being all"
247,00:14:36.12,00:14:36.12,"pissed off.You know, what am I supposed to"
248,00:14:37.62,00:14:37.62,"do?>> The thing is, though, is"
249,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33,"Amanda, she understands that inthe game, she's in a good spot"
250,00:14:41.71,00:14:41.71,"with us.Plus, what is she going to do,"
251,00:14:45.21,00:14:45.21,align with Peih-Gee and a bushright now?
252,00:14:47.75,00:14:47.75,"You know what I mean?Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on"
253,00:14:55.12,00:14:55.12,"board Survivor Airlines, flightnumber 15, the three coolest"
254,00:14:58.88,00:14:58.88,people going to the Great Wallof China.
255,00:15:01.71,00:15:01.71,">> Whoo-hoo!>> Thanks, Denise!"
256,00:15:05.04,00:15:05.04,">> Thanks, Todd.>> Oh, wow, look."
257,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,">> Oh, wow.>> Oh-wee."
258,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,It just keeps going.>> To win the challenge and
259,00:15:29.21,00:15:29.21,actually go to the Great Wall ofChina was an incredible thing.
260,00:15:32.00,00:15:32.00,The views stretch off all theway on the hills and the
261,00:15:34.71,00:15:34.71,mountains.And then we actually got up
262,00:15:36.50,00:15:36.50,"there-- I mean, just amazing tobe standing someplace where 600"
263,00:15:40.04,00:15:40.04,years ago there were soldiersrunning back and forth and
264,00:15:42.58,00:15:42.58,"cannons.And, you know, just to be"
265,00:15:44.75,00:15:44.75,staying in the same place wasamazing.
266,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,>> Thank you.>> Thank you.
267,00:15:52.00,00:15:52.00,>> And our beds are right heretoo.
268,00:15:54.92,00:15:54.92,>> Thank you.>> Thank you.
269,00:15:57.46,00:15:57.46,>> Is it fondue?>> It smells good.
270,00:16:00.12,00:16:00.12,>> You dip it in.>> I'm confused.
271,00:16:05.42,00:16:05.42,>> I'm super confused.>> We had this huge table full
272,00:16:08.71,00:16:08.71,"of food, and we all kind oflooked at it like, ""What are we"
273,00:16:11.54,00:16:11.54,"supposed to do with it?It's all raw."""
274,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,And there was a big bowl thingin front of us.
275,00:16:15.04,00:16:15.04,I guess we put it in here.This little Chinese waiter guy
276,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,"comes in, and he starts saying,""Dip it and put it in..."""
277,00:16:22.25,00:16:22.25,"And we're like, ""Okay."">> Yeah, exactly."
278,00:16:29.67,00:16:29.67,That's sweet.That's good.
279,00:16:31.08,00:16:31.08,>> Mm.>> It turned into a big
280,00:16:33.29,00:16:33.29,"jambalaya pot of, like, stuff,and I was surprised at how quick"
281,00:16:37.25,00:16:37.25,I got full.It was like that that my body
282,00:16:40.00,00:16:40.00,"was like, ""You're done.""At least Peih-Gee will hopefully"
283,00:16:43.54,00:16:43.54,be weak.>> She will also be filled with
284,00:16:48.25,00:16:48.25,hatred that will spur her toaction.
285,00:16:50.33,00:16:50.33,>> Exactly.>> It was sort of a strategic
286,00:16:52.54,00:16:52.54,"thing to have Denise bring Toddinstead of Amanda to this,"
287,00:16:56.12,00:16:56.12,because Amanda is a lot lesslikely to stir up trouble back
288,00:17:00.04,00:17:00.04,at camp than Todd would be.An angry Todd is a bad Todd.
289,00:17:14.12,00:17:14.12,>> Do you see how many thereare?
290,00:17:15.75,00:17:15.75,">> Oh, my God.Oh, my God."
291,00:17:18.58,00:17:18.58,"Oh, my God!We strung out the net yesterday,"
292,00:17:22.58,00:17:22.58,and we didn't know if we weregoing to catch anything because
293,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,"we've had nothing in our netsfor, like, a week."
294,00:17:26.50,00:17:26.50,"So we start pulling up the net,me and Peih-Gee, and there's,"
295,00:17:29.71,00:17:29.71,"like, tons of fish.It feels fabulous."
296,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,>> Delightful seafood risottowith a little red wine reduction
297,00:17:40.83,00:17:40.83,"and rice wine.Pour it in, girl."
298,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,"Oops.>> Oops, I used it all the sake."
299,00:17:49.12,00:17:49.12,"Oh, my God!>> Is it delicious?"
300,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,>> Uh-huh.This is good.
301,00:17:54.79,00:17:54.79,">> It's totally good.>> Oh, my God."
302,00:17:59.46,00:17:59.46,">> There's, like, seriously,like, enough rice for, like, two"
303,00:18:01.92,00:18:01.92,"days though.>> Up until this point, I had"
304,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"nothing on Amanda, and I have alot more insight on her, and"
305,00:18:31.33,00:18:31.33,I've actually gotten moreinformation on the dynamics of
306,00:18:33.33,00:18:33.33,their old group.>> I am open for things.
307,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,"I have been the whole time.>> That's too funny that, like,"
308,00:18:45.17,00:18:45.17,"we've been on, like, the samewavelength."
309,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,">> I know.>> At this point in the game, it"
310,00:18:50.04,00:18:50.04,looks maybe she really isn'tdead set on going with Todd and
311,00:18:52.50,00:18:52.50,Courtney yet.It gives me a little bit of
312,00:18:54.04,00:18:54.04,"hope.>> Ooh, what's this?"
313,00:19:08.25,00:19:08.25,">> Oh, my God!>> Oh, my God, thank you!"
314,00:19:15.75,00:19:15.75,">> Oh, my gosh.>> It's so good!"
315,00:19:18.58,00:19:18.58,>> I'm the happiest boy aliveright now.
316,00:19:21.33,00:19:21.33,"I just want to bring up aquestion, like, and I don't know"
317,00:19:23.62,00:19:23.62,"how to think about it, but,like, say Peih-Gee did win"
318,00:19:26.54,00:19:26.54,"immunity again.>> Oh, lord."
319,00:19:29.54,00:19:29.54,">> Would we want a fight betweenthe four of us, or would we want"
320,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"to take off our love, Amanda?>> I don't know."
321,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,What do you want to do?>> I don't know.
322,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,">> I think all of us are goingto say, ""I don't want to go"
323,00:19:40.58,00:19:40.58,"home.""But I think, you know, people's"
324,00:19:42.42,00:19:42.42,answers would probably change ifshe was sitting here.
325,00:19:44.62,00:19:44.62,">> I mean, I know I'm tight withAmanda."
326,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,"I have been for a long time.But I'm trying to think, too,"
327,00:19:48.21,00:19:48.21,"like, can we beat her?>> Do we beat her?"
328,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,">> We're the meanies!I mean, good lord, me and Todd"
329,00:19:55.25,00:19:55.25,are like the devil incarnate inthis game.
330,00:19:57.29,00:19:57.29,"They hate us.>> In this four person alliance,"
331,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,"I kind of feel scared, becauseTodd's backstabbed a lot of"
332,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,people.He's been making alliances with
333,00:20:05.21,00:20:05.21,everybody and not tellinganybody and doing shifty things.
334,00:20:09.12,00:20:09.12,>> We know we're catty.We might as well just go to the
335,00:20:10.71,00:20:10.71,"end together, right?>> Yes."
336,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,>> This is a critical time rightnow.
337,00:20:14.50,00:20:14.50,"Someone is going to be left outof our group, and I don't want"
338,00:20:17.21,00:20:17.21,it to be me.>> Is anybody home?
339,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,"Where are they?>> When we got back to camp,"
340,00:20:49.04,00:20:49.04,"Peih-Gee and Amanda weren'tthere, and we were like, ""Um,"
341,00:20:52.08,00:20:52.08,"where are you guys?Like, where did everybody go?"""
342,00:20:54.75,00:20:54.75,And I was concerned because theywere pissed when we left.
343,00:20:58.00,00:20:58.00,>> Are we getting extremeSurvivor paranoia right now?
344,00:21:02.88,00:21:02.88,">> Oh, yeah, look.>> Oh, yeah, look."
345,00:21:05.96,00:21:05.96,">> Hi, girls!>> Hi!"
346,00:21:08.83,00:21:08.83,">> Hey, guys!>> Yeah."
347,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,">> Amazing, huh?>> The Great Wall was so neat."
348,00:21:13.88,00:21:13.88,>> But it's a culturalexperience.
349,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,">> It was a big, huge table, andthere was sliced chicken and"
350,00:21:18.33,00:21:18.33,"sliced pork...>> Yeah, yeah."
351,00:21:20.46,00:21:20.46,>> Raw.>> ...that was raw that we had
352,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,to put in the soup to eat.There was a dipping sauce.
353,00:21:26.04,00:21:26.04,">> Which made all of us, like,upset stomachs."
354,00:21:29.46,00:21:29.46,>> It made our stomachs goweird.
355,00:21:31.25,00:21:31.25,"We had to dip it, like, oil.We didn't know what to do."
356,00:21:33.83,00:21:33.83,>> We had no idea.>> They come back from the Great
357,00:21:36.21,00:21:36.21,"Wall, and they were complaining.The food, nobody explained to"
358,00:21:39.12,00:21:39.12,"them how to eat it, and theydidn't like the food."
359,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,"It's like, ""Come on!"">> Hey, at least you got to eat,"
360,00:21:46.71,00:21:46.71,though.>> That's true.
361,00:21:49.21,00:21:49.21,>> Todd and Courtney still findthings to complain about when
362,00:21:51.29,00:21:51.29,they win a reward?It just blows my mind.
363,00:21:55.25,00:21:55.25,"Some people are so ungrateful,and honestly, it made me mad."
364,00:22:15.25,00:22:15.25,>> I'm kind of upset with Toddand Courtney.
365,00:22:17.54,00:22:17.54,They didn't bring anything backfor me and Peih-Gee.
366,00:22:19.79,00:22:19.79,They know I haven't eaten verymuch.
367,00:22:21.62,00:22:21.62,So Denise is showing a littlemore compassion to my situation
368,00:22:24.54,00:22:24.54,"than Todd, and it's definitelygoing noticed."
369,00:22:31.12,00:22:31.12,">> Absolutely.>> Okay, that sounds good."
370,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,>> All right.Hm.
371,00:22:55.38,00:22:55.38,"You ready?""What doesn't kill you makes you"
372,00:22:57.75,00:22:57.75,stronger.This time it means much more.
373,00:23:01.21,00:23:01.21,A second chance to proveyourself may get you to the
374,00:23:03.08,00:23:03.08,"final four.""It's a repeat of previous"

564,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,"It's just really, really, reallyworked out for me that my"
565,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,alliance was the right one.Peih-Gee was coming off as a
566,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,"fighter, and that's why she hasto go so badly."
567,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,"If she somehow convinces thoseother girls to vote me off, I"
568,00:36:02.29,00:36:02.29,"will be pissed off if I gohome-- like, livid."
569,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,But big ups to them for figuringa way to get rid of me.

575,00:36:52.58,00:36:52.58,">> Definitely a dilemma.I mean, what a tough decision."
576,00:36:55.04,00:36:55.04,"I... you know, I was turmoil inmy brain."
577,00:36:57.96,00:36:57.96,I knew I had to pick Courtney.She hasn't been eating.
578,00:37:00.50,00:37:00.50,She hasn't gone on a lot of thechallenges.
579,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,And I picked Todd to go with meas well.

585,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,frustrating.So it would have been nice to be

587,00:37:25.42,00:37:25.42,"But I'm negative Nancy, sothat's just... that's me."

597,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,really the first chance you'vehad to bond with Peih-Gee.

599,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,"different perspective on her?>> Oh, it definitely did."
600,00:38:01.96,00:38:01.96,"I got to learn a lot about Peih-Gee, and I really respect, like,"
601,00:38:05.08,00:38:05.08,"how she's made it this far, andshe's still strong and fighting,"
602,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,and I really respect her forthat.
603,00:38:11.88,00:38:11.88,"So it was nice.>> PROBST: Courtney, does it"
604,00:38:15.46,00:38:15.46,"matter to you if somebody'sdeserving or not, or are you"
605,00:38:18.50,00:38:18.50,playing strictly to be withpeople that you can beat?

613,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,I think somebody who managed toget to this same position and
614,00:38:46.75,00:38:46.75,"did it honorably, I think theydeserve it more than somebody"
615,00:38:49.42,00:38:49.42,"who got to the same position anddid it by cheating, lying,"
616,00:38:52.42,00:38:52.42,"backstabbing, all of that.>> PROBST: Todd, where do you"

618,00:38:59.17,00:38:59.17,was a shoe-in you would beat oranother person who might be a
619,00:39:02.58,00:39:02.58,tougher competitor butdefinitely deserved that chance
620,00:39:05.88,00:39:05.88,"at a million dollars, which waywould you go?"
621,00:39:08.50,00:39:08.50,">> Honestly, I think I've pissedthe most people off, and that's"
622,00:39:12.96,00:39:12.96,kind of key.I don't know how many of them
623,00:39:15.96,00:39:15.96,won't vote for me just becausethey actually hate my guts.
624,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,"So when it's a million dollarson the line, you got to look at"
625,00:39:21.29,00:39:21.29,"yourself and say, ""Who am Igoing to beat, you know, in the"
626,00:39:24.50,00:39:24.50,"finals?""-- not ""Who played afantastic game that can probably"
