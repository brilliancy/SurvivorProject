194,00:11:20.12,00:11:20.12,"I'm being left out of everything, so..."
195,00:11:26.96,00:11:26.96,">> PROBST: Amanda, how you feeling?"
196,00:11:28.29,00:11:28.29,">> Yeah, it's not a good feeling, you know, but, I mean,"
197,00:11:30.92,00:11:30.92,"what can do you? >> PROBST: Not much, because I"
198,00:11:34.29,00:11:34.29,"got nothing for you. >> I'm sorry, guys."
199,00:11:37.17,00:11:37.17,">> PROBST: Denise, Todd, Courtney, you will fly to the"
200,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"Great Wall of China, have a nice meal, spend the night."
201,00:11:42.00,00:11:42.00,"Great reward, enjoy it, get your stuff, head out."
202,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,>> Just me and you. >> Yeah.
203,00:12:05.96,00:12:05.96,">> I'm pissed. After the challenge, I"
204,00:12:08.17,00:12:08.17,"definitely lost my cool, you know, said some things that I"
205,00:12:10.75,00:12:10.75,probably shouldn't have. It's just frustrating.
206,00:12:13.29,00:12:13.29,"I mean, I picked Denise for a reward, and to have her win"
207,00:12:16.12,00:12:16.12,"twice now and not pick me, it's tough."
208,00:12:18.50,00:12:18.50,"And then also I heard her say, ""I don't want Peih-Gee getting"
209,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,"any stronger."" That part makes me mad, because"
210,00:12:24.50,00:12:24.50,"it's like, hello, I'm still a person."
211,00:12:39.96,00:12:39.96,">> Everything is so much work, as it is, and then, like, having"
212,00:12:43.83,00:12:43.83,"to do it all just sucks. Don't screw this up, Amanda."
213,00:12:51.21,00:12:51.21,"It's coming down to, like, the end of the game, and three"
214,00:12:54.29,00:12:54.29,"people are having meals and eating, and I used to be one of"
215,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,"those three, and now I'm not. So it's... it's hard."
216,00:13:03.92,00:13:03.92,Why is it you dislike me so much?
217,00:13:05.88,00:13:05.88,>> Huh? >> Why do you dislike me so
218,00:13:07.12,00:13:07.12,"much? >> I don't dislike you, Amanda,"
219,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,seriously. >> Because it's like ever since
220,00:13:12.08,00:13:12.08,"you came here, like, you haven't really talked to me at all, and,"
221,00:13:15.25,00:13:15.25,"like, at tribal, I feel like you're always attacking me."
222,00:13:19.29,00:13:19.29,">> I mean, I'm sorry. Like, honestly, like, I'm sorry"
223,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"that, like... if it hurts your feelings or anything like that."
224,00:13:23.79,00:13:23.79,"It's really... >> No, I just want to know,"
225,00:13:25.08,00:13:25.08,"because I'd like to get it... I'd like to get it out, like..."
226,00:13:28.29,00:13:28.29,">> Yeah, no, actually, I'm glad that, like, we get some time to"
227,00:13:30.50,00:13:30.50,"spend together, because, like... >> I am, too, actually."
228,00:13:32.12,00:13:32.12,">> Like, I, like... we really haven't had a lot of time to"
229,00:13:34.54,00:13:34.54,"talk, and, like, I think it's cool that we get to... you know,"
230,00:13:36.75,00:13:36.75,get to know each other a little better.
231,00:13:38.12,00:13:38.12,">> Yeah, me, too. >> I actually respect Amanda for"
232,00:13:39.83,00:13:39.83,speaking her mind. I think we had some just
233,00:13:43.17,00:13:43.17,miscommunication with her making assumptions of me and me making
234,00:13:47.08,00:13:47.08,"assumptions of her, and it's because we hadn't had a chance"
235,00:13:50.38,00:13:50.38,to really sit down and talk. >> There's one.
236,00:13:54.88,00:13:54.88,>> Awesome. >> Right there.
237,00:14:01.21,00:14:01.21,"There's one. >> Ooh, that was a huge one."
238,00:14:03.62,00:14:03.62,>> I know. >> Awesome.
239,00:14:05.88,00:14:05.88,">> Yay, we have food. Oh, we just found a huge Asian"
240,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,"pear and huge limes, so we're really happy, because we have"
241,00:14:13.12,00:14:13.12,food to eat. Yay!
242,00:14:16.17,00:14:16.17,Life doesn't suck right now. >> Whoo-hoo!
243,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,>> You guys are awesome. >> How cool is this?
244,00:14:28.88,00:14:28.88,I'm so grateful you picked me. Peih-Gee we can't feed right now
245,00:14:31.21,00:14:31.21,"because... >> No, I can't give her"
246,00:14:33.00,00:14:33.00,anything. And I feel bad.
247,00:14:34.42,00:14:34.42,"She was like, ""I'm not going to vote for you now,"" and being all"
248,00:14:36.12,00:14:36.12,"pissed off. You know, what am I supposed to"
249,00:14:37.62,00:14:37.62,"do? >> The thing is, though, is"
250,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33,"Amanda, she understands that in the game, she's in a good spot"
251,00:14:41.71,00:14:41.71,"with us. Plus, what is she going to do,"
252,00:14:45.21,00:14:45.21,align with Peih-Gee and a bush right now?
253,00:14:47.75,00:14:47.75,"You know what I mean? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on"
254,00:14:55.12,00:14:55.12,"board Survivor Airlines, flight number 15, the three coolest"
255,00:14:58.88,00:14:58.88,people going to the Great Wall of China.
256,00:15:01.71,00:15:01.71,">> Whoo-hoo! >> Thanks, Denise!"
257,00:15:05.04,00:15:05.04,">> Thanks, Todd. >> Oh, wow, look."
258,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,">> Oh, wow. >> Oh-wee."
259,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,It just keeps going. >> To win the challenge and
260,00:15:29.21,00:15:29.21,actually go to the Great Wall of China was an incredible thing.
261,00:15:32.00,00:15:32.00,The views stretch off all the way on the hills and the
262,00:15:34.71,00:15:34.71,mountains. And then we actually got up
263,00:15:36.50,00:15:36.50,"there-- I mean, just amazing to be standing someplace where 600"
264,00:15:40.04,00:15:40.04,years ago there were soldiers running back and forth and
265,00:15:42.58,00:15:42.58,"cannons. And, you know, just to be"
266,00:15:44.75,00:15:44.75,staying in the same place was amazing.
267,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,>> Thank you. >> Thank you.
268,00:15:52.00,00:15:52.00,>> And our beds are right here too.
269,00:15:54.92,00:15:54.92,>> Thank you. >> Thank you.
270,00:15:57.46,00:15:57.46,>> Is it fondue? >> It smells good.
271,00:16:00.12,00:16:00.12,>> You dip it in. >> I'm confused.
272,00:16:05.42,00:16:05.42,>> I'm super confused. >> We had this huge table full
273,00:16:08.71,00:16:08.71,"of food, and we all kind of looked at it like, ""What are we"
274,00:16:11.54,00:16:11.54,"supposed to do with it? It's all raw."""
275,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,And there was a big bowl thing in front of us.
276,00:16:15.04,00:16:15.04,I guess we put it in here. This little Chinese waiter guy
277,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,"comes in, and he starts saying, ""Dip it and put it in..."""
278,00:16:22.25,00:16:22.25,"And we're like, ""Okay."" >> Yeah, exactly."
279,00:16:29.67,00:16:29.67,That's sweet. That's good.
280,00:16:31.08,00:16:31.08,>> Mm. >> It turned into a big
281,00:16:33.29,00:16:33.29,"jambalaya pot of, like, stuff, and I was surprised at how quick"
282,00:16:37.25,00:16:37.25,I got full. It was like that that my body
283,00:16:40.00,00:16:40.00,"was like, ""You're done."" At least Peih-Gee will hopefully"
284,00:16:43.54,00:16:43.54,be weak. >> She will also be filled with
285,00:16:48.25,00:16:48.25,hatred that will spur her to action.
286,00:16:50.33,00:16:50.33,>> Exactly. >> It was sort of a strategic
287,00:16:52.54,00:16:52.54,"thing to have Denise bring Todd instead of Amanda to this,"
288,00:16:56.12,00:16:56.12,because Amanda is a lot less likely to stir up trouble back
289,00:17:00.04,00:17:00.04,at camp than Todd would be. An angry Todd is a bad Todd.
290,00:17:14.12,00:17:14.12,>> Do you see how many there are?
291,00:17:15.75,00:17:15.75,">> Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
292,00:17:18.58,00:17:18.58,"Oh, my God! We strung out the net yesterday,"
293,00:17:22.58,00:17:22.58,and we didn't know if we were going to catch anything because
294,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,"we've had nothing in our nets for, like, a week."
295,00:17:26.50,00:17:26.50,"So we start pulling up the net, me and Peih-Gee, and there's,"
296,00:17:29.71,00:17:29.71,"like, tons of fish. It feels fabulous."
297,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,>> Delightful seafood risotto with a little red wine reduction
298,00:17:40.83,00:17:40.83,"and rice wine. Pour it in, girl."
299,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,"Oops. >> Oops, I used it all the sake."
300,00:17:49.12,00:17:49.12,"Oh, my God! >> Is it delicious?"
301,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,>> Uh-huh. This is good.
302,00:17:54.79,00:17:54.79,">> It's totally good. >> Oh, my God."
303,00:17:59.46,00:17:59.46,">> There's, like, seriously, like, enough rice for, like, two"
304,00:18:01.92,00:18:01.92,"days though. >> Up until this point, I had"
305,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"nothing on Amanda, and I have a lot more insight on her, and"
306,00:18:31.33,00:18:31.33,I've actually gotten more information on the dynamics of
307,00:18:33.33,00:18:33.33,their old group. >> I am open for things.
308,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,"I have been the whole time. >> That's too funny that, like,"
309,00:18:45.17,00:18:45.17,"we've been on, like, the same wavelength."
310,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,">> I know. >> At this point in the game, it"
311,00:18:50.04,00:18:50.04,looks maybe she really isn't dead set on going with Todd and
312,00:18:52.50,00:18:52.50,Courtney yet. It gives me a little bit of
313,00:18:54.04,00:18:54.04,"hope. >> Ooh, what's this?"
314,00:19:08.25,00:19:08.25,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God, thank you!"
315,00:19:15.75,00:19:15.75,">> Oh, my gosh. >> It's so good!"
316,00:19:18.58,00:19:18.58,>> I'm the happiest boy alive right now.
317,00:19:21.33,00:19:21.33,"I just want to bring up a question, like, and I don't know"
318,00:19:23.62,00:19:23.62,"how to think about it, but, like, say Peih-Gee did win"
319,00:19:26.54,00:19:26.54,"immunity again. >> Oh, lord."
320,00:19:29.54,00:19:29.54,">> Would we want a fight between the four of us, or would we want"
321,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"to take off our love, Amanda? >> I don't know."
322,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,What do you want to do? >> I don't know.
323,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,">> I think all of us are going to say, ""I don't want to go"
324,00:19:40.58,00:19:40.58,"home."" But I think, you know, people's"
325,00:19:42.42,00:19:42.42,answers would probably change if she was sitting here.
326,00:19:44.62,00:19:44.62,">> I mean, I know I'm tight with Amanda."
327,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,"I have been for a long time. But I'm trying to think, too,"
328,00:19:48.21,00:19:48.21,"like, can we beat her? >> Do we beat her?"
329,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,">> We're the meanies! I mean, good lord, me and Todd"
330,00:19:55.25,00:19:55.25,are like the devil incarnate in this game.
331,00:19:57.29,00:19:57.29,"They hate us. >> In this four person alliance,"
332,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,"I kind of feel scared, because Todd's backstabbed a lot of"
333,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,people. He's been making alliances with
334,00:20:05.21,00:20:05.21,everybody and not telling anybody and doing shifty things.
335,00:20:09.12,00:20:09.12,>> We know we're catty. We might as well just go to the
336,00:20:10.71,00:20:10.71,"end together, right? >> Yes."
337,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,>> This is a critical time right now.
338,00:20:14.50,00:20:14.50,"Someone is going to be left out of our group, and I don't want"
339,00:20:17.21,00:20:17.21,it to be me. >> Is anybody home?
340,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,"Where are they? >> When we got back to camp,"
341,00:20:49.04,00:20:49.04,"Peih-Gee and Amanda weren't there, and we were like, ""Um,"
342,00:20:52.08,00:20:52.08,"where are you guys? Like, where did everybody go?"""
343,00:20:54.75,00:20:54.75,And I was concerned because they were pissed when we left.
344,00:20:58.00,00:20:58.00,>> Are we getting extreme Survivor paranoia right now?
345,00:21:02.88,00:21:02.88,">> Oh, yeah, look. >> Oh, yeah, look."
346,00:21:05.96,00:21:05.96,">> Hi, girls! >> Hi!"
347,00:21:08.83,00:21:08.83,">> Hey, guys! >> Yeah."
348,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,">> Amazing, huh? >> The Great Wall was so neat."
349,00:21:13.88,00:21:13.88,>> But it's a cultural experience.
350,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,">> It was a big, huge table, and there was sliced chicken and"
351,00:21:18.33,00:21:18.33,"sliced pork... >> Yeah, yeah."
352,00:21:20.46,00:21:20.46,>> Raw. >> ...that was raw that we had
353,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,to put in the soup to eat. There was a dipping sauce.
354,00:21:26.04,00:21:26.04,">> Which made all of us, like, upset stomachs."
355,00:21:29.46,00:21:29.46,>> It made our stomachs go weird.
356,00:21:31.25,00:21:31.25,"We had to dip it, like, oil. We didn't know what to do."
357,00:21:33.83,00:21:33.83,>> We had no idea. >> They come back from the Great
358,00:21:36.21,00:21:36.21,"Wall, and they were complaining. The food, nobody explained to"
359,00:21:39.12,00:21:39.12,"them how to eat it, and they didn't like the food."
360,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,"It's like, ""Come on!"" >> Hey, at least you got to eat,"
361,00:21:46.71,00:21:46.71,though. >> That's true.
362,00:21:49.21,00:21:49.21,>> Todd and Courtney still find things to complain about when
363,00:21:51.29,00:21:51.29,they win a reward? It just blows my mind.
364,00:21:55.25,00:21:55.25,"Some people are so ungrateful, and honestly, it made me mad."
365,00:22:15.25,00:22:15.25,>> I'm kind of upset with Todd and Courtney.
366,00:22:17.54,00:22:17.54,They didn't bring anything back for me and Peih-Gee.
367,00:22:19.79,00:22:19.79,They know I haven't eaten very much.
368,00:22:21.62,00:22:21.62,So Denise is showing a little more compassion to my situation
369,00:22:24.54,00:22:24.54,"than Todd, and it's definitely going noticed."
370,00:22:31.12,00:22:31.12,">> Absolutely. >> Okay, that sounds good."
371,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,>> All right. Hm.
372,00:22:55.38,00:22:55.38,"You ready? ""What doesn't kill you makes you"
373,00:22:57.75,00:22:57.75,stronger. This time it means much more.
374,00:23:01.21,00:23:01.21,A second chance to prove yourself may get you to the
375,00:23:03.08,00:23:03.08,"final four."" It's a repeat of previous"
376,00:23:05.83,00:23:05.83,challenges mixed together. >> Yeah.
377,00:23:09.00,00:23:09.00,>> Peih-Gee is probably most under the gun today to win
378,00:23:11.21,00:23:11.21,"immunity, but so is Todd. I don't trust a thing he says."
379,00:23:15.17,00:23:15.17,If he can backstab everyone in this game to get himself an inch
380,00:23:17.67,00:23:17.67,"further, he would. So if he doesn't win next"
381,00:23:21.08,00:23:21.08,"immunity challenge, I may have to think about getting rid of"
382,00:23:23.92,00:23:23.92,Todd. >> PROBST: Guys ready to get to
383,00:23:36.67,00:23:36.67,today's immunity challenge? First things first.

420,00:26:16.21,00:26:16.21,stay in this. Todd scores one on his first
421,00:26:21.17,00:26:21.17,"throw. Oh, it sticks in the one and"
422,00:26:28.42,00:26:28.42,falls out. Todd one throw left.
423,00:26:30.96,00:26:30.96,You have one point. You need at least one point on
424,00:26:33.25,00:26:33.25,this throw. Todd doesn't get it.
425,00:26:41.12,00:26:41.12,Todd does not move on. Everybody else moving on to the

430,00:27:04.00,00:27:04.00,down. Peih-Gee eating quickly.
431,00:27:08.92,00:27:08.92,Courtney shoves half of it in her mouth.
432,00:27:12.17,00:27:12.17,Do not think about what you're eating.
433,00:27:14.12,00:27:14.12,Think about something else and shove it down.
434,00:27:17.83,00:27:17.83,"Peih-Gee, you don't see any problem with this, do you?"
435,00:27:19.46,00:27:19.46,">> It's so good. >> Good, Courtney."

444,00:27:38.29,00:27:38.29,"Denise, after 36 days and a one- in-four shot, you're not even"
445,00:27:41.08,00:27:41.08,"trying. >> I put it in my mouth, and I"
446,00:27:43.04,00:27:43.04,"puked it up again, Jeff. I really wish I could."

451,00:28:01.08,00:28:01.08,obstacles. First two to bounce a ball into

453,00:28:06.96,00:28:06.96,Survivors ready? Go!

456,00:28:19.96,00:28:19.96,"section. Peih-Gee loses it, got to head"
457,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,"back to the start. Courtney, got to go back to the"
458,00:28:25.04,00:28:25.04,start. Amanda now into the second

469,00:29:25.08,00:29:25.08,eight wooden disks. You must then use the disks to

471,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,guaranteed spot in the final four.

490,00:30:43.42,00:30:43.42,Amanda has two pieces complete on the puzzle.
491,00:30:46.08,00:30:46.08,Peih-Gee still working on her first.
492,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,Amanda working on that third piece.
493,00:30:50.71,00:30:50.71,Does she have the right one? She does.
494,00:30:53.58,00:30:53.58,Amanda with three pieces completed.
495,00:30:55.46,00:30:55.46,Peih-Gee completes her first piece.
496,00:30:58.25,00:30:58.25,There are eight pieces total to this puzzle.

500,00:31:17.88,00:31:17.88,Only three left. Amanda not sure if she has the
501,00:31:29.54,00:31:29.54,right piece or not. Puzzle only goes together one
502,00:31:33.38,00:31:33.38,way. Peih-Gee with her fourth piece.
503,00:31:37.96,00:31:37.96,Amanda giving Peih-Gee a chance to get back in this.
504,00:31:47.21,00:31:47.21,Amanda has her sixth piece. Amanda down to two pieces left.
505,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,Peih-Gee with her fifth piece. Amanda with her seventh piece.

507,00:32:00.88,00:32:00.88,"the final four! >> I won immunity, you guys!"
508,00:32:04.46,00:32:04.46,>> Good job. >> I never thought...
509,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,">> PROBST: Amanda, come on over. You are guaranteed a spot in the"
510,00:32:13.21,00:32:13.21,"final four-- not going anywhere. Peih-Gee, Todd, Courtney,"
511,00:32:17.04,00:32:17.04,"Denise, after 36 days, somebody going home tonight."
512,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,See you at tribal. Grab your stuff.
513,00:32:22.00,00:32:22.00,Head on back to camp. >> Thank you.
514,00:32:47.00,00:32:47.00,">> Oh, my God. That was tough."
515,00:32:49.62,00:32:49.62,I came so close to winning immunity again.
516,00:32:53.71,00:32:53.71,"So it's just a sharp disappointment, because I'm next"
517,00:32:56.17,00:32:56.17,on the chopping block almost for sure.
518,00:32:58.50,00:32:58.50,But I think there's a chance that I can turn this around for
519,00:33:01.46,00:33:01.46,"me, and I think Amanda is my best hope right now for a"
520,00:33:05.21,00:33:05.21,"reprieve. >> You did such a great job,"
521,00:33:07.46,00:33:07.46,kid. >> Thank you.
522,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,>> I'm so proud of you. >> Thanks.
523,00:33:11.04,00:33:11.04,I was really excited to win immunity today because I just
524,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,wanted a for-sure final four spot.
525,00:33:16.04,00:33:16.04,And so I'm stoked. And this is kind of a neat thing
526,00:33:19.67,00:33:19.67,"for me because I have a little bit of power right now, having"
527,00:33:22.08,00:33:22.08,the immunity. >> That's it?
528,00:33:37.25,00:33:37.25,>> That's it. >> You guys went to town
529,00:33:38.83,00:33:38.83,"yesterday, didn't you? We had more than that."
530,00:33:43.12,00:33:43.12,">> Todd made this comment, ""Oh, my God, you guys ate so much"
531,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,"rice. We have no rice left."""
532,00:33:47.88,00:33:47.88,"And I just kind of looked at him like, ""I don't even want to hear"
533,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"it."" It took everything I had not to,"
534,00:33:52.54,00:33:52.54,"like, flip out. >> Exactly."
535,00:34:00.92,00:34:00.92,>> And we have to both watch each other's back.
536,00:34:02.21,00:34:02.21,">> Yeah, absolutely. I agree with that."
537,00:34:05.04,00:34:05.04,>> I have been dancing around the idea of getting rid of Todd
538,00:34:07.42,00:34:07.42,"for a while now, because he's a threat."
539,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,"He's a strategist, you know? Like, he could go behind my back"
540,00:34:13.08,00:34:13.08,at any point in this game and take me out.
541,00:34:16.50,00:34:16.50,"Me and Peih-Gee have definitely bonded on a personal level, so"
542,00:34:19.21,00:34:19.21,I'm beginning to think maybe I'll have a better chance to get
543,00:34:21.62,00:34:21.62,in the final three right now with Denise and Peih-Gee.
544,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,">> I fought so hard to be here, and I've played, like, what I"
545,00:34:26.62,00:34:26.62,"think is, like, a pretty, like, honorable game."
546,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,">> I know you have. >> And, like, Todd has been"
547,00:34:31.38,00:34:31.38,"backstabbing people and lying to people and playing everybody,"
548,00:34:33.96,00:34:33.96,"like, left and right. >> Peih-Gee is on the outsides"
549,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,"right now, and everybody's trying to vote her off."
550,00:34:39.21,00:34:39.21,"So she's trying to get rid of Todd, and I don't blame her."
551,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,"But Todd's made a lot of enemies on the jury, and I think I have"
552,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,a chance of winning against Todd if I keep him in the finals.
553,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,So I'm still torn. >> I like you so much.
554,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,"Like, our day together changed my whole view of you, and I"
555,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,don't want to vote you out. >> I don't either.
556,00:35:00.83,00:35:00.83,>> I hope you guys knock off Todd.
557,00:35:02.83,00:35:02.83,"It'd be, like, three girls. I mean, I don't know what you"
558,00:35:06.46,00:35:06.46,"guys are planning, but I'd like to see that happen."
559,00:35:22.21,00:35:22.21,>> Yeah. >> Uh-uh.
560,00:35:25.08,00:35:25.08,>> I think she's probably at that stage where she realizes
561,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,that she doesn't have any hope. Yeah.
562,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"Yeah, watch me get blindsided tonight."
563,00:35:36.92,00:35:36.92,I had a little bit of paranoia when I saw my name read twice at
564,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,"the last tribal council, but I still feel kind of comfortable."
565,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,"It's just really, really, really worked out for me that my"
566,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,alliance was the right one. Peih-Gee was coming off as a
567,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,"fighter, and that's why she has to go so badly."
568,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,"If she somehow convinces those other girls to vote me off, I"
569,00:36:02.29,00:36:02.29,"will be pissed off if I go home-- like, livid."
570,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,But big ups to them for figuring a way to get rid of me.
571,00:36:30.38,00:36:30.38,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Jaime,"
572,00:36:34.88,00:36:34.88,"Jean-Robert, Frosti, James, and Erik, voted out at the last"
573,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,"tribal council. Denise, let's talk about winning"
574,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,the reward challenge. You get to bring two people with
575,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,"you and, on the other hand, leave two people behind."
576,00:36:52.58,00:36:52.58,">> Definitely a dilemma. I mean, what a tough decision."
577,00:36:55.04,00:36:55.04,"I... you know, I was turmoil in my brain."
578,00:36:57.96,00:36:57.96,I knew I had to pick Courtney. She hasn't been eating.
579,00:37:00.50,00:37:00.50,She hasn't gone on a lot of the challenges.
580,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,And I picked Todd to go with me as well.
581,00:37:05.58,00:37:05.58,">> PROBST: Courtney, tell me about the reward."
582,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,">> Um, the food proved to be a little confusing for the three"
583,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,"of us. Like, you know, I consider"
584,00:37:14.21,00:37:14.21,"myself a pretty adventurous eater, but you know, when your"
585,00:37:16.04,00:37:16.04,"body wants things that it recognizes, it's kind of"
586,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,frustrating. So it would have been nice to be
587,00:37:21.42,00:37:21.42,"like, ""Pizza and beer, whoo!"" You know, like, ""Yay, party!"""
588,00:37:25.42,00:37:25.42,"But I'm negative Nancy, so that's just... that's me."
589,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,"I would have wanted pizza. >> PROBST: Peih-Gee, what's up?"
590,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,"You're shaking your head. >> It's just... for me, it just"
591,00:37:33.67,00:37:33.67,"gets really frustrating, because I am one of those positive"
592,00:37:35.75,00:37:35.75,"people, and I've been fighting hard every day, and to hear"
593,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"somebody say, ""Well, I kind of tend to be negative about"
594,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,"things, and I kind of haven't really cared about the game, I'm"
595,00:37:44.88,00:37:44.88,"only here because other people have let me stay in it,"" it's"
596,00:37:47.42,00:37:47.42,"just really frustrating, and it hurts me."
597,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,"Like, it does. >> PROBST: Amanda, this is"
598,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,really the first chance you've had to bond with Peih-Gee.
599,00:37:56.75,00:37:56.75,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Did it give you a
600,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,"different perspective on her? >> Oh, it definitely did."
601,00:38:01.96,00:38:01.96,"I got to learn a lot about Peih- Gee, and I really respect, like,"
602,00:38:05.08,00:38:05.08,"how she's made it this far, and she's still strong and fighting,"
603,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,and I really respect her for that.
604,00:38:11.88,00:38:11.88,"So it was nice. >> PROBST: Courtney, does it"
605,00:38:15.46,00:38:15.46,"matter to you if somebody's deserving or not, or are you"
606,00:38:18.50,00:38:18.50,playing strictly to be with people that you can beat?
607,00:38:22.38,00:38:22.38,>> How can you look at anyone who sat outside for 36 days and
608,00:38:25.08,00:38:25.08,put up with all this insanity and say you don't deserve to be
609,00:38:27.50,00:38:27.50,"here? >> PROBST: Peih-Gee, after"
610,00:38:30.42,00:38:30.42,"tonight's vote, will the four people left be the four most"
611,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,"deserving? >> For me, most deserving means"
612,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"somebody who fought hard every single chance they had, you"
613,00:38:41.38,00:38:41.38,"know, really came out here and challenged themselves."
614,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,I think somebody who managed to get to this same position and
615,00:38:46.75,00:38:46.75,"did it honorably, I think they deserve it more than somebody"
616,00:38:49.42,00:38:49.42,"who got to the same position and did it by cheating, lying,"
617,00:38:52.42,00:38:52.42,"backstabbing, all of that. >> PROBST: Todd, where do you"
618,00:38:56.75,00:38:56.75,stand on that? If you could take somebody that
619,00:38:59.17,00:38:59.17,was a shoe-in you would beat or another person who might be a
620,00:39:02.58,00:39:02.58,tougher competitor but definitely deserved that chance
621,00:39:05.88,00:39:05.88,"at a million dollars, which way would you go?"
622,00:39:08.50,00:39:08.50,">> Honestly, I think I've pissed the most people off, and that's"
623,00:39:12.96,00:39:12.96,kind of key. I don't know how many of them
624,00:39:15.96,00:39:15.96,won't vote for me just because they actually hate my guts.
625,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,"So when it's a million dollars on the line, you got to look at"
626,00:39:21.29,00:39:21.29,"yourself and say, ""Who am I going to beat, you know, in the"
627,00:39:24.50,00:39:24.50,"finals?""-- not ""Who played a fantastic game that can probably"
628,00:39:28.38,00:39:28.38,"kick my ass?"" >> PROBST: All right, Amanda,"
629,00:39:32.54,00:39:32.54,you have immunity. You always have the option to
630,00:39:35.00,00:39:35.00,give it to somebody else. >> I'll keep it.
631,00:39:37.04,00:39:37.04,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Amanda.
632,00:39:38.75,00:39:38.75,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
633,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,"Todd, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
634,00:40:35.71,00:40:35.71,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
635,00:40:37.46,00:40:37.46,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
636,00:40:39.25,00:40:39.25,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
637,00:40:45.46,00:40:45.46,"First vote, Peih-Gee. Todd."
638,00:40:52.58,00:40:52.58,"One vote Peih-Gee, one vote Todd."
639,00:40:58.58,00:40:58.58,"Peih-Gee. Two votes Peih-Gee, one vote"
640,00:41:01.17,00:41:01.17,Todd. 12th person voted out and the
641,00:41:06.75,00:41:06.75,"sixth member of our jury, Peih- Gee."
642,00:41:09.00,00:41:09.00,That's three. That's enough.
643,00:41:10.17,00:41:10.17,You need to bring me your torch. >> Bye.
644,00:41:21.50,00:41:21.50,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, the tribe has spoken."
645,00:41:25.17,00:41:25.17,"Time for you to go. Well, you have only three days"
646,00:41:40.00,00:41:40.00,"left, but still a lot to contend with-- challenges, strategy, and"
647,00:41:45.58,00:41:45.58,"ultimately, the jury. Should make for a fun finish."
648,00:41:50.08,00:41:50.08,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

662,00:42:39.75,00:42:39.75,"I pushed myself physically, mentally, strategically, and"
663,00:42:44.71,00:42:44.71,"ultimately, everybody was scared to death to go against me in"
664,00:42:47.38,00:42:47.38,final three. So I'm not going to be a
665,00:42:50.29,00:42:50.29,"millionaire, but I still feel like I walked away way richer"
666,00:42:53.42,00:42:53.42,than I was before I came into this game.
