304,00:19:01.96,00:19:01.96,I don't think she's going tofully realize her potential

321,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,stupid.I think he has higher
322,00:20:04.25,00:20:04.25,expectations for me than hedoes for other people.
323,00:20:06.67,00:20:06.67,He thinks of me as a strongfemale.
324,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,You're going to be harder onthat one just so that they play
325,00:20:12.21,00:20:12.21,harder in a game.And I think that's what...
326,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,"where his mind's really at.And I could very well be wrong,"
327,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,but I think there's some goodintent behind it.
328,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,">> Thanks, Coach.>> PROBST: Later that day, at"
329,00:20:28.08,00:20:28.08,"Jalapao, the muck and grime ofthe game gave Sydney another"
