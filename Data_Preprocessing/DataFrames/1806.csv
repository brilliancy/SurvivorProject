2,00:00:18.96,00:00:18.96,Survivor: Tocantins have seen some of the most memorable
3,00:00:21.75,00:00:21.75,castaways yet. They've been competing fiercely
4,00:00:26.00,00:00:26.00,in one of the most unforgiving environments in the world.
5,00:00:30.92,00:00:30.92,This is what you've seen so far.
6,00:00:34.79,00:00:34.79,Survivors ready? Go!
7,00:00:39.25,00:00:39.25,Timbira wins immunity! >> That's not okay.
8,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,>> Who the hell do you think you are?
9,00:00:43.75,00:00:43.75,>> That will get old really quick.
10,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,">> PROBST: Carolina, the tribe has spoken."
11,00:00:48.17,00:00:48.17,Candace trying to take Taj down. J.T. fakes out Jerry!
12,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,Jalapao wins. You're now going to send one
13,00:00:53.71,00:00:53.71,member of Timbira to Exile Island.
14,00:00:58.29,00:00:58.29,">> Now, to the twist, choose one member of the winning tribe"
15,00:01:01.17,00:01:01.17,to join you. >> Taj.
16,00:01:05.12,00:01:05.12,>> You work Sierra. I'll work Steve.
17,00:01:07.58,00:01:07.58,We would have a four-way alliance that nobody knows
18,00:01:11.00,00:01:11.00,about. >> That nobody knows about.
19,00:01:12.58,00:01:12.58,>> Exactly. >> You're the best accomplice
20,00:01:14.75,00:01:14.75,ever. >> I think they're going to be
21,00:01:18.21,00:01:18.21,"under- or overcooked. >> Hopefully, Candace has her"
22,00:01:20.33,00:01:20.33,bags packed because she is out of here.
23,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,>> PROBST: The tribe has spoken. >> Debbie!
24,00:01:26.04,00:01:26.04,">> Brendan! >> Debbie, where's our bucket?"
25,00:01:27.79,00:01:27.79,>> I don't know. I can't see it!
26,00:01:29.58,00:01:29.58,>> PROBST: Jalapao wins immunity!
27,00:01:32.58,00:01:32.58,>> I found the idol. Yes!
28,00:01:35.17,00:01:35.17,">> Hey, everybody, Jerry's sick. See you, Jerry."
29,00:01:38.50,00:01:38.50,>> PROBST: Timbira does win immunity!
30,00:01:42.92,00:01:42.92,>> I'm voting for Sandy because she's crazy.
31,00:01:48.25,00:01:48.25,>> Do you want to be a part of the biggest upset on Survivor
32,00:01:50.71,00:01:50.71,"history? >> Yes, I do."
33,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,">> Okay, stuff this in your pocket."
34,00:01:53.42,00:01:53.42,Do something with it. Hide it.
35,00:01:55.25,00:01:55.25,>> I might have just stumbled ass-backwards into a huge
36,00:01:57.88,00:01:57.88,alliance.  >> J.T.!

38,00:02:05.08,00:02:05.08,>> Launch! >> PROBST: Timbira wins
39,00:02:07.54,00:02:07.54,immunity! >> Somebody has to go tonight.
40,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,It's gotta be Spence. >> PROBST: Fifth person voted

49,00:03:53.92,00:03:53.92,"castaways were split into two tribes, and they were about to"
50,00:03:57.83,00:03:57.83,begin a cutthroat game where first impressions meant
51,00:04:01.21,00:04:01.21,everything. >> Being in the back of that
52,00:04:03.25,00:04:03.25,truck really did give you a good amount of time to just
53,00:04:06.21,00:04:06.21,kind of size everybody up and see what you're up against.
54,00:04:10.25,00:04:10.25,">> As for first impressions with people, I try not to come"
55,00:04:12.79,00:04:12.79,into it with too many because I think that gets you in trouble
56,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,a lot of times. >> My first impression of the
57,00:04:18.33,00:04:18.33,"girl in the gray striped T-shirt, obviously, was upset;"
58,00:04:22.83,00:04:22.83,"she had her head down, and, yes, it was hot, we were all hot, but"
59,00:04:25.92,00:04:25.92,"we weren't showing it. And so, I really didn't feel"
60,00:04:29.12,00:04:29.12,like she wanted to be here with us.
61,00:04:31.21,00:04:31.21,>> It was blazing hot. I had a fever.
62,00:04:35.04,00:04:35.04,I was so sick. I didn't even give a flying
63,00:04:38.33,00:04:38.33,... what they thought about me.
64,00:04:45.08,00:04:45.08,>> Whoa! >> PROBST: You will have 60
65,00:04:50.62,00:04:50.62,seconds to gather as much as you can.
66,00:04:53.00,00:04:53.00,Your time starts now because this game is on!
67,00:04:56.75,00:04:56.75,>> Get down. I'll hand it to you.
68,00:04:58.79,00:04:58.79,">> Here, hand it to me. >> We have the long-haired guy"

74,00:05:21.58,00:05:21.58,"the leadership role. Now, is that going to be a"
75,00:05:23.50,00:05:23.50,shared role? It depends.
76,00:05:25.38,00:05:25.38,The characteristics and the qualities that I have as an
77,00:05:27.96,00:05:27.96,individual has been forged like an iron thrown into the fire and
78,00:05:32.46,00:05:32.46,"coming out unshakable, unbreakable, invincible like a"
79,00:05:35.12,00:05:35.12,sword. I know who I am.
80,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,>> We are screwed. They have Stephen Segal.
81,00:05:40.29,00:05:40.29,What the hell are we going to do against the (indistinct) man?
82,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,"I have no idea. We clearly have, physically, a"
83,00:05:46.25,00:05:46.25,"weaker tribe. Um, there's the hot, blonde"
84,00:05:48.25,00:05:48.25,girl. It really is going to be a
85,00:05:50.17,00:05:50.17,shame when we have to vote her off.
86,00:05:52.29,00:05:52.29,">> I guess I'm, you know, a professional model now."
87,00:05:55.42,00:05:55.42,"I mean, I've been doing it for three and a half years, but, um,"
88,00:05:58.21,00:05:58.21,"yeah, I don't know, it's still kind of funny to me because I"
89,00:06:01.17,00:06:01.17,"just, I laugh at myself a lot. >> PROBST: You guys have a long"
90,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,journey ahead of you. You need to get to camp.
91,00:06:09.08,00:06:09.08,You need to start working on shelter.
92,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,The tribes began an epic four-hour journey toward their
93,00:06:18.08,00:06:18.08,"camps, but Jalapao stumbled out of the gate."
94,00:06:21.12,00:06:21.12,">> This was our mark, right? I'm not afraid to run back to"
95,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50,the road and look at it. >> I think that might be our
96,00:06:28.58,00:06:28.58,"best point, our best idea.  >> You think so?"
97,00:06:31.17,00:06:31.17,">> Yeah, I would definitely because I'm not sure what tree"
98,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,we're looking at. >> As long as we don't veer off
99,00:06:38.71,00:06:38.71,"that line, I know we do avoid trees and stuff, it will still"
100,00:06:41.21,00:06:41.21,be the same degree. >> That's true.
101,00:06:43.17,00:06:43.17,"That's true, all right. >> If we just hit that strip"
102,00:06:45.50,00:06:45.50,"of palm trees, we'll be fine. >> Well, J.T.'s, he's from 'Bama"
103,00:06:48.12,00:06:48.12,">> That's right. >> J.T. is more of a brawn guy,"
104,00:06:51.88,00:06:51.88,"not your sophisticate, intellect, academia-type guy."
105,00:06:56.54,00:06:56.54,>> People's impression of me might be that I'm a hillbilly
106,00:06:58.88,00:06:58.88,"sometimes, uh, but I consider a hillbilly someone uneducated."
107,00:07:02.08,00:07:02.08,I don't think a hillbilly would make it very far in this game.
108,00:07:07.25,00:07:07.25,"Uh, there's no doubt in my mind I can win or I'd have stayed"
109,00:07:09.25,00:07:09.25,at home. I'm here to win and I'm going
110,00:07:11.17,00:07:11.17,"to win. >> Are we going the right way,"
111,00:07:13.42,00:07:13.42,y'all? My biggest strategy going in
112,00:07:15.62,00:07:15.62,"will just be ""kill them with kindness."""
113,00:07:17.38,00:07:17.38,"I'll be so nice to them, they're not going to want to kick me"
114,00:07:19.29,00:07:19.29,off. You guys okay?
115,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,Okay. Because another thing I think
116,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,that they're probably underestimating about me is
117,00:07:26.58,00:07:26.58,that I look fat. But I'm not really fat.
118,00:07:31.71,00:07:31.71,"I'm muscular. So, when I'm winning challenges,"
119,00:07:36.12,00:07:36.12,they won't have a reason to try to kick me off.
120,00:07:38.21,00:07:38.21,They can't. I'm going to be so good at this
121,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,they won't be ready for me. >> Whoo!
122,00:07:44.21,00:07:44.21,(cheering) (squealing)
123,00:07:56.96,00:07:56.96,>> Chew it! Chew it! Don't waste it.
124,00:07:58.67,00:07:58.67,>> I guess it's like God's candy.
125,00:08:00.58,00:08:00.58,">> Is this for real? >> Thanks, God."
126,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,">> PROBST: On their first full day at camp, but without fire to"
127,00:08:36.17,00:08:36.17,cook their beans... >> What happens if you just eat
128,00:08:38.29,00:08:38.29,dry beans? >> PROBST: ...Timbira had to
129,00:08:40.21,00:08:40.21,resort to other sources of food for much-needed protein.
130,00:08:44.42,00:08:44.42,>> Did you get it? >> No.
131,00:08:46.21,00:08:46.21,>> I think it's going to be a lot harder than anybody
132,00:08:48.04,00:08:48.04,realizes out here. Foraging for food is going to be
133,00:08:50.92,00:08:50.92,difficult. Dang.
134,00:08:53.92,00:08:53.92,">> I'm getting slower, I think. Want to give it a try?"
135,00:08:56.54,00:08:56.54,>> We're trying to catch fish. We've got a burlap bag and
136,00:08:59.21,00:08:59.21,we try to drop different things in and grab fish.
137,00:09:01.50,00:09:01.50,">> You got one? >> Yes, a teeny little one."
138,00:09:03.42,00:09:03.42,>> At least it's one. >> Eat it.
139,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,"Eat that. >> You go, you go, Debbie."
140,00:09:10.71,00:09:10.71,>> I'll eat that one that you've got in your hands.
141,00:09:12.67,00:09:12.67,">> Why, because this guy... >> Yeah, 'cause that one's"
142,00:09:14.88,00:09:14.88,gross. Ugh!
143,00:09:17.08,00:09:17.08,">> Put your mouth there. >> Uh, okay."
144,00:09:21.25,00:09:21.25,>> Chew it! Chew it! >> Chew it.
145,00:09:23.33,00:09:23.33,"Don't just waste it. Yummy, sushi, sashimi."
146,00:09:26.21,00:09:26.21,"Mmm. >> Okay, it actually did taste"
147,00:09:30.12,00:09:30.12,a little like sushi. That is definitely not in my
148,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,"character, but I threw it in my mouth and chewed it up as quick"
149,00:09:35.21,00:09:35.21,as I could to get a little protein.
150,00:09:37.62,00:09:37.62,I cannot believe I just chewed up a live fish in my teeth.
151,00:09:42.46,00:09:42.46,>> I'm gonna clean these things out.
152,00:09:44.25,00:09:44.25,">> The fish, we have just those little minnows to eat, but we"
153,00:09:48.17,00:09:48.17,"found, uh, that fruit that smells like foot."
154,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,>> Jerry! >> Yeah.
155,00:09:52.50,00:09:52.50,>> All that jatoba.  Shut your mouth!
156,00:09:57.08,00:09:57.08,">> No, it's really, it's better than eating the..."
157,00:09:59.21,00:09:59.21,>> I'm having a hard time sticking this in my mouth.
158,00:10:01.75,00:10:01.75,>> Come on. It's good. >> This is a Brazilian fruit
159,00:10:03.92,00:10:03.92,"called a jatoba, and, uh, it's got like a really hard, like,"
160,00:10:09.29,00:10:09.29,"pod shell on it, and then inside it's got this almost powdery"
161,00:10:13.88,00:10:13.88,flesh. It really makes you thirsty.
162,00:10:16.71,00:10:16.71,It kind of sucks all the saliva out of your mouth.
163,00:10:24.17,00:10:24.17,>> Is this for real? >> Yeah.
164,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,>> Come on. How is it? >> Uh-uh.
165,00:10:42.04,00:10:42.04,">> But here, there's nothing else to eat, so, it's, I guess"
166,00:10:45.25,00:10:45.25,"it's like God's candy in Brazil. So, thanks, God."
167,00:10:53.25,00:10:53.25,">> PROBST: On day seven, after winning comfort items in a"
168,00:10:56.08,00:10:56.08,"reward challenge, Jalapao's campfire was out and getting the"
169,00:11:00.17,00:11:00.17,fire restarted proved to be a tough task.
170,00:11:03.38,00:11:03.38,(metal and wood scratching) >> I'm doing something wrong
171,00:11:07.71,00:11:07.71,here. >> Try to strike into it more.
172,00:11:15.17,00:11:15.17,>> Like that? >> Strike it.
173,00:11:21.83,00:11:21.83,>> Strike it. >> There you go.
174,00:11:22.79,00:11:22.79,">> Strike it. Like, hit it. >> There you go."
175,00:11:24.25,00:11:24.25,>> That's how I did it. >> Stephen really wanted to
176,00:11:29.58,00:11:29.58,make a fire because he's never made a fire.
177,00:11:31.46,00:11:31.46,"He's out there with the flint, with the machete, dinging away."
178,00:11:34.96,00:11:34.96,It was hilarious. He could not make a freaking
179,00:11:38.46,00:11:38.46,"spark. >> On the scale of 1 to 100,"
180,00:11:49.96,00:11:49.96,my wilderness skills are at about a 1.
181,00:11:53.25,00:11:53.25,"I cannot make fire, and that is embarrassing."
182,00:11:57.42,00:11:57.42,Aah! I'll do it some other time.
183,00:12:01.62,00:12:01.62,This is stupid. >> Sure?
184,00:12:03.21,00:12:03.21,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> All right."
185,00:12:06.17,00:12:06.17,"I might not be able to start it, either."
186,00:12:07.88,00:12:07.88,(chuckles) >> I grew up fishing with my
187,00:12:13.92,00:12:13.92,"dad outdoors all the time, so I've-I..."
188,00:12:16.83,00:12:16.83,"you know, I've lived the outdoors."
189,00:12:21.96,00:12:21.96,"I'm not just a girly girl, you know."
190,00:12:24.25,00:12:24.25,I'm not just some pretty girl that they're...
191,00:12:26.58,00:12:26.58,"You know, they can flirt with. (sighing)"
192,00:12:44.58,00:12:44.58,">> Yes. >> Good job, Syd."
193,00:12:46.54,00:12:46.54,">> Oh, nice, Sydney. Fuego."
194,00:12:49.92,00:12:49.92,"(chuckles) >> At first, Sydney was"
195,00:12:52.42,00:12:52.42,"definitely getting by on her looks, on her charm, on her"
196,00:12:55.71,00:12:55.71,"girlish laugh. But Sydney made fire for us,"
197,00:12:58.00,00:12:58.00,you know? She's a woodland goddess and I
198,00:13:00.42,00:13:00.42,"think, for that reason, she's a big threat to me."
199,00:13:02.83,00:13:02.83,"(laughing) >> PROBST: At Timbira, Tyson was"
200,00:13:08.79,00:13:08.79,busy enhancing the first impression he'd made on his
201,00:13:11.67,00:13:11.67,"fellow castaways, proving that value to a tribe can come in"
202,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,many ways. >> I smell like a man today.
203,00:13:19.50,00:13:19.50,(laughing) They think I just always smell
204,00:13:21.83,00:13:21.83,like flowers and exotic fruits. Who am I?
205,00:13:27.33,00:13:27.33,"Um... Oh, that question."
206,00:13:35.17,00:13:35.17,"Who am I? Pretty well-balanced individual,"
207,00:13:41.88,00:13:41.88,"I'd say. >> Oh, my God!"
208,00:13:44.50,00:13:44.50,">> Let's win! >> Oh, God."
209,00:13:47.25,00:13:47.25,"(gasping) >> Tyson never, ever ceases to"
210,00:13:51.25,00:13:51.25,amaze me. >> I can do that.
211,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,"(laughing) >> Oh, my God."
212,00:13:59.04,00:13:59.04,>> See? >> Did you see the arch in his
213,00:14:01.46,00:14:01.46,"back? >> Yeah, you have to do the"
214,00:14:03.00,00:14:03.00,arch. It pops better.
215,00:14:04.17,00:14:04.17,>> I don't even know how to do the arch thing.
216,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,"Honestly, I think Tyson is somebody that everybody better"
217,00:14:10.21,00:14:10.21,watch out. I think Tyson has the real
218,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33,potential to win this game. >> Try and get through this.
219,00:14:21.83,00:14:21.83,">> A little Tai Bo here, or what?"
220,00:14:24.04,00:14:24.04,Are you sparring? What are you doing?
221,00:14:25.12,00:14:25.12,>> I was going to kick her in the (bleep).
222,00:14:27.46,00:14:27.46,"(laughing) >> Tyson, he's always cracking"
223,00:14:30.67,00:14:30.67,a joke. One of a kind.
224,00:14:32.58,00:14:32.58,"I mean, that's probably what attracts me to him so much,"
225,00:14:35.25,00:14:35.25,"you know, not in a sexual way. >> Take you to the ground right"
226,00:14:39.75,00:14:39.75,here. (laughing)
227,00:14:44.75,00:14:44.75,"Ow. >> What you doing, Debbie?"
228,00:14:49.00,00:14:49.00,(laughing) >> Debbie.
229,00:14:52.08,00:14:52.08,>> I want you to stop. >> Stop doing that to me.
230,00:14:55.33,00:14:55.33,"My parents are going to see that, Debra!"
231,00:14:58.04,00:14:58.04,>> You weren't very quick to get off.
232,00:15:01.08,00:15:01.08,>> That is not lady-like. >> I slipped and got stuck!
233,00:15:04.04,00:15:04.04,>> I don't know what you were doing.
234,00:15:05.62,00:15:05.62,I was bent over looking at the ground and you jumped right on
235,00:15:08.08,00:15:08.08,top. Your boobs popped out?
236,00:15:10.38,00:15:10.38,>> Maybe. >> That's fitting.
237,00:15:12.67,00:15:12.67,I'm not the stereotypical Mormon.
238,00:15:14.29,00:15:14.29,"I respect the church and the people in it, but for myself,"
239,00:15:19.50,00:15:19.50,"personally, you know, there's things I want to do and not"
240,00:15:22.83,00:15:22.83,"necessarily that are sinning. >> Oh, no!"
241,00:15:29.12,00:15:29.12,>> We'll see what happens when I get home and everyone disowns
242,00:15:31.12,00:15:31.12,"me. Okay, team, I got tired of the"
243,00:15:34.17,00:15:34.17,"rope. >> Oh, yeah, look at that."
244,00:15:37.33,00:15:37.33,(laughing) >> Debbie!
245,00:15:39.54,00:15:39.54,">> Oh, my God. >> Debbie!"
246,00:15:46.08,00:15:46.08,>> You'll never be able to have children again.
247,00:15:48.08,00:15:48.08,>> I don't care. I'll probably have to move
248,00:15:51.21,00:15:51.21,"somewhere else, somewhere less Mormony."
249,00:15:59.88,00:15:59.88,>> Make beans? I've always seen two people do
250,00:16:01.46,00:16:01.46,"it. >> Sierra, we've got to do"
251,00:16:03.79,00:16:03.79,chores by ourselves. We can't all hold each other's
252,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,hands. >> Don't talk to me like I'm
253,00:16:07.08,00:16:07.08,stupid. >> I'm just saying it doesn't
254,00:16:08.33,00:16:08.33,take two people. I was not being condescending.
255,00:16:11.83,00:16:11.83,>>> I'm pissed. >> How many handfuls of beans
256,00:16:52.17,00:16:52.17,should I do? >> PROBST: Sierra made a bad
257,00:16:54.96,00:16:54.96,"first impression with her Timbira tribemates, but by day"
258,00:16:57.75,00:16:57.75,"eight, her strength seemed to be returning and Coach was"
259,00:17:00.71,00:17:00.71,"ready to put her to work. >> Sierra, how about you cook"
260,00:17:03.33,00:17:03.33,the beans? >> Make fire and the beans?
261,00:17:05.71,00:17:05.71,>> You'd have only one person doing it.
262,00:17:07.33,00:17:07.33,"One person putting the firewood on the fire, same person cooking"
263,00:17:10.83,00:17:10.83,"the beans, and nobody stomping around."
264,00:17:14.08,00:17:14.08,>> I've always seen two people do it.
265,00:17:16.12,00:17:16.12,>> That's why we're getting stuff in our beans and our
266,00:17:18.67,00:17:18.67,rice because there are too many people around there.
267,00:17:20.83,00:17:20.83,I'm watching the stuff fly up in the air while stuff is
268,00:17:23.79,00:17:23.79,"cooking. Sierra, you put a log on the"
269,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,"fire, then put another log on the fire, and then stir the"
270,00:17:31.17,00:17:31.17,"beans, and then wait. >> Yeah, I understand."
271,00:17:34.33,00:17:34.33,>> Put another log on the fire. It doesn't take two people.
272,00:17:36.83,00:17:36.83,>> Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
273,00:17:38.25,00:17:38.25,>> I'm just saying it doesn't take two people.
274,00:17:40.25,00:17:40.25,">> Yeah, but it's nice to have someone, like a female, like"
275,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,tending the fire and then one's cooking and then...
276,00:17:47.79,00:17:47.79,You know what I mean? It's nice to...
277,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,">> Sierra, we've got to do chores by ourselves."
278,00:17:52.08,00:17:52.08,"We can't all hold each other's hands, and for to you say that"
279,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,"you want somebody there to talk to, I mean, there's a lot of"
280,00:17:57.17,00:17:57.17,stuff to do. >> Yeah.
281,00:17:58.75,00:17:58.75,">> You know, we got to... >> I know and I've been part"
282,00:18:00.42,00:18:00.42,"of it since day one. >> I know that, but I'm "
283,00:18:02.25,00:18:02.25,"just saying we got to start doing stuff independently, as"
284,00:18:05.04,00:18:05.04,"well. >> Okay, that's fine."
285,00:18:06.38,00:18:06.38,What are you guys going to be doing while I'm doing that?
286,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,>> Fishing. >> All of you are going to go
287,00:18:10.25,00:18:10.25,fishing? >> We're going to take about
288,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,four of us down there and see if we can just surround
289,00:18:14.08,00:18:14.08,them and fish. >> Okay.
290,00:18:20.08,00:18:20.08,>> Is that going to stress you out?
291,00:18:22.04,00:18:22.04,It looks like it's stressing you out.
292,00:18:23.79,00:18:23.79,">> Why don't you talk to me from over here, so you don't get dirt"
293,00:18:26.12,00:18:26.12,in the beans? (chuckling)
294,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"I'm one of the ones working the hardest, so..."
295,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,I'm really getting tired of people like Coach saying
296,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,"things, ""You need to do this,"" and shaking their finger and"
297,00:18:36.08,00:18:36.08,coming down on me. They think they can 'cause
298,00:18:37.75,00:18:37.75,they think they're older than me and they think they're more
299,00:18:39.33,00:18:39.33,"knowledgeable. Um, it's only going to make me"
300,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,"turn on them faster. >> I can be very condescending,"
301,00:18:48.21,00:18:48.21,"but as a leader or just as a person, that's not somebody"
302,00:18:51.38,00:18:51.38,that I want to be. I was not being condescending
303,00:18:54.71,00:18:54.71,towards Sierra. I was actually just trying to
304,00:18:57.71,00:18:57.71,"wean her from the (bleep), so to speak."
305,00:19:01.96,00:19:01.96,I don't think she's going to fully realize her potential
306,00:19:04.12,00:19:04.12,"when people keep coddling her. There's a bunch of big, juicy"
307,00:19:11.08,00:19:11.08,ones up there. >> Uh-huh.
308,00:19:19.88,00:19:19.88,">> It's been a bountiful tree, hasn't it been?"
309,00:19:22.04,00:19:22.04,>> Yeah. >> Not very talkative.
310,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,">> I'm pissed. >> So, you want me to tell you"
311,00:19:31.67,00:19:31.67,why I was picking on you? >> Yeah.
312,00:19:36.42,00:19:36.42,>> I was gently trying to push you out of the nest.
313,00:19:39.58,00:19:39.58,"And I just... I wanted to see you like,"
314,00:19:41.96,00:19:41.96,expand yourself because I know you can.
315,00:19:45.04,00:19:45.04,">> Mm-hmm. >> You know, there's this part"
316,00:19:46.54,00:19:46.54,of your personality that is very dependent and there's this
317,00:19:49.46,00:19:49.46,part of your personality that's very independent.
318,00:19:51.17,00:19:51.17,>> That's true. >> Same as me.
319,00:19:52.67,00:19:52.67,"But you can never coast in life, in this game, and you"
320,00:19:56.92,00:19:56.92,know that. >> Now that I think about it
321,00:19:59.62,00:19:59.62,"and start to, like, cool off, I don't think Coach thinks I'm"
322,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,stupid. I think he has higher
323,00:20:04.25,00:20:04.25,expectations for me than he does for other people.
324,00:20:06.67,00:20:06.67,He thinks of me as a strong female.
325,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,You're going to be harder on that one just so that they play
326,00:20:12.21,00:20:12.21,harder in a game. And I think that's what...
327,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,"where his mind's really at. And I could very well be wrong,"
328,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,but I think there's some good intent behind it.
329,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,">> Thanks, Coach. >> PROBST: Later that day, at"
330,00:20:28.08,00:20:28.08,"Jalapao, the muck and grime of the game gave Sydney another"
331,00:20:32.17,00:20:32.17,chance to prove her worth. >> Look at this.
332,00:20:34.67,00:20:34.67,Is that a... That is wild.
333,00:20:36.96,00:20:36.96,Nice. Look at...
334,00:20:39.04,00:20:39.04,Looky here. Birthmark there.
335,00:20:41.21,00:20:41.21,"It is so dirty out here. We live in ash, and it clings"
336,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,to you. >> Get away from me.
337,00:20:50.79,00:20:50.79,">> Every morning we get dirtier and dirtier, so it's, um..."
338,00:20:54.67,00:20:54.67,It's been kind of annoying for us.
339,00:20:56.92,00:20:56.92,"I mean, I'm totally down for a floor."
340,00:21:01.29,00:21:01.29,"And that would solve all of our problem with the soot, with the"
341,00:21:05.88,00:21:05.88,palms. J.T. has had the plan to lift
342,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,"our shelter off the ground, and it's a good idea."
343,00:21:12.96,00:21:12.96,"You know, why not try it? And I wanted to show him that"
344,00:21:15.58,00:21:15.58,"I'm behind him 100%, and let's just do it."
345,00:21:18.58,00:21:18.58,Let's go. This is going to be awesome.
346,00:21:22.54,00:21:22.54,>> I don't think I'm the leader of Jalapao.
347,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,"I've just always been one where I'm ready to get something done,"
348,00:21:27.04,00:21:27.04,"I do it myself. So, I'm not doing it just to be"
349,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,the leader or do anybody else any favors.
350,00:21:32.12,00:21:32.12,"I'm doing it because I want to get it done, and that's the"
351,00:21:34.25,00:21:34.25,best way to do something. >> Wow.
352,00:21:43.54,00:21:43.54,>> Can I contribute here? Is there anything I can do here?
353,00:21:51.96,00:21:51.96,Tying? Digging?
354,00:21:54.12,00:21:54.12,Posting? >> Uh...
355,00:21:58.79,00:21:58.79,>> I did think Stephen was somewhat nerdy when we started
356,00:22:01.92,00:22:01.92,out. It feels like I have a little
357,00:22:04.08,00:22:04.08,brother or sidekick. He's definitely a city boy.
358,00:22:08.38,00:22:08.38,">> I think we're kind of going along as we go, but we could"
359,00:22:11.04,00:22:11.04,"definitely use your help, yeah. I think J.T. holds the power"
360,00:22:23.25,00:22:23.25,right now. So I'm definitely trying to get
361,00:22:25.67,00:22:25.67,on his good side a little bit. I think people have their first
362,00:22:28.62,00:22:28.62,"impressions of me, and, you know, and I always try to prove"
363,00:22:32.54,00:22:32.54,that wrong. I think we did a really good
364,00:22:34.71,00:22:34.71,"job on... on, you know, getting the floor off the ground."
365,00:22:37.54,00:22:37.54,I'll sleep better tonight. That's for sure.

367,00:22:48.88,00:22:48.88,"leader had been ongoing between Brendan and Coach at Timbira,"
368,00:22:53.25,00:22:53.25,"and on day eight, they went toe-to-toe to provide comfort"

370,00:22:58.25,00:22:58.25,the seat... >> Yes.
371,00:22:59.33,00:22:59.33,>> ...can you... any chance you could put ropes in between it?
372,00:23:01.92,00:23:01.92,I think it's more comfortable... >> I was actually going to put
373,00:23:04.21,00:23:04.21,"three together. >> Oh, put three together."
374,00:23:05.54,00:23:05.54,>> I was going to put three together.
375,00:23:07.62,00:23:07.62,>> But it's got to be comfortable this time.
376,00:23:09.17,00:23:09.17,">> The thing is, is that every time I make another seat around"

379,00:23:14.54,00:23:14.54,the good... making your own personal seat.
380,00:23:15.96,00:23:15.96,">> No, I'm not! I'm just saying..."
381,00:23:20.25,00:23:20.25,>> No. >> I would love something to do.
382,00:23:21.92,00:23:21.92,>> Give me some twine. I'll undo the twine.
383,00:23:27.12,00:23:27.12,>> A bench-making contest? >> Yes.
384,00:23:29.29,00:23:29.29,">> Ooh, I love to see the alpha men go at it."
385,00:23:33.12,00:23:33.12,>> Coach is definitely a character.
386,00:23:34.83,00:23:34.83,"We're competing here and there but to me, this is about having"
387,00:23:37.17,00:23:37.17,a good time. That's what we came out here to
388,00:23:39.04,00:23:39.04,"do, and so any time, you know, you're not, you should kind of"
389,00:23:42.79,00:23:42.79,"check yourself and be like, let's do it."
390,00:23:52.92,00:23:52.92,>> Coach needs it more than I do.
391,00:23:55.17,00:23:55.17,>> I've got longer rope. Funky.
392,00:23:57.88,00:23:57.88,>> There is a very serious vying for the spot of alpha male
393,00:24:02.17,00:24:02.17,contest happening right now. I don't think it has anything to
394,00:24:04.75,00:24:04.75,do with benches or swings or seats.
395,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,"I think it's who can come out on top, as usual."
396,00:24:09.92,00:24:09.92,>> Put your ass going in between the two.
397,00:24:11.92,00:24:11.92,">> That's even worse. >> Oh, please."
398,00:24:13.08,00:24:13.08,">> This is terrible, man! >> Tearing the tribe apart,"
399,00:24:15.46,00:24:15.46,guys. >> The ladies will come over
400,00:24:18.25,00:24:18.25,and judge. >> So we're having a bench-
401,00:24:19.67,00:24:19.67,"building contest, which we love. Because now we have more places"
402,00:24:21.92,00:24:21.92,to sit. >> Now we have more seats.
403,00:24:23.25,00:24:23.25,"And what my idea is, like, let's start having contests of who can"
404,00:24:25.00,00:24:25.00,"get the river water faster. >> All the time, yeah."
405,00:24:28.12,00:24:28.12,>> Who can get the beans going the fastest.
406,00:24:29.75,00:24:29.75,>> Who can collect the most firewood?
407,00:24:31.25,00:24:31.25,We'll judge them all. It will be great.
408,00:24:33.25,00:24:33.25,">> Oh, see, I can't leave that. >> Oh, this is very comfortable!"
409,00:24:35.50,00:24:35.50,(Tarzan yell) >> I haven't sat on that one
410,00:24:38.54,00:24:38.54,yet. >> That's definitely going
411,00:24:41.21,00:24:41.21,"to be more comfortable. >> Yeah, and we said that it"
412,00:24:42.79,00:24:42.79,"was only about comfort, man. It was not about time."
413,00:24:45.25,00:24:45.25,It was not about people. >> It was about taking care of
414,00:24:47.25,00:24:47.25,"the tribe. >> Yeah, I think I know where"
415,00:24:48.83,00:24:48.83,Coach's button is. >> We did not say it.
416,00:24:51.42,00:24:51.42,">> Coach, it's not about you. It's about the tribe."
417,00:24:53.79,00:24:53.79,>> I know it's about the tribe. Why do you think I wanted to
418,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,have a bench-building contest in the first place?
419,00:24:58.42,00:24:58.42,>> This is the most fun I've had in a while.
420,00:25:00.17,00:25:00.17,"I'm an entrepreneur, so I started a business."
421,00:25:02.33,00:25:02.33,"When I think about business, you know, every day, when you"
422,00:25:04.50,00:25:04.50,"build something from scratch, interacting with people that"
423,00:25:06.58,00:25:06.58,you've never met before is something I adore.
424,00:25:09.54,00:25:09.54,"You know, Coach tries to act like a coach all the time."
425,00:25:11.92,00:25:11.92,We're not out here to have a coach.
426,00:25:13.33,00:25:13.33,"We don't need one. You know, we're out here to have"
427,00:25:15.25,00:25:15.25,friends; we're out here to work with people.
428,00:25:17.08,00:25:17.08,>> 'Cause it will fall down when you sit on it.
429,00:25:18.79,00:25:18.79,>> This is delicious. Good job.

433,00:25:36.83,00:25:36.83,bad. >> Yeah.
434,00:25:43.50,00:25:43.50,I can't believe I look like this.
435,00:25:46.04,00:25:46.04,I feel like a leper. >> How are you feeling?
436,00:26:04.62,00:26:04.62,"Are you all right? >> No, I'm fine."
437,00:26:08.12,00:26:08.12,">> No, you can come on. We're just... I'm chitchatting"
438,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,"with her, man. I know she had a..."
439,00:26:11.54,00:26:11.54,>> I can't look at myself. >> I just feel so ugly.
440,00:26:14.12,00:26:14.12,>> It must have been really hard last night.
441,00:26:16.25,00:26:16.25,">> Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God."
442,00:26:21.62,00:26:21.62,I'm sorry. (sobbing)
443,00:26:25.08,00:26:25.08,>> I got a little emotional because I just looked at
444,00:26:27.58,00:26:27.58,myself... and I just had a moment
445,00:26:34.67,00:26:34.67,because I just... I don't know what's going on.
446,00:26:38.00,00:26:38.00,My back is just destroyed. And I still have to go home.
447,00:26:43.42,00:26:43.42,So I just don't want to go home looking like a wreck.
448,00:26:46.33,00:26:46.33,>> One of the hardest things you've ever done?
449,00:26:49.08,00:26:49.08,">> You know, it wasn't so much hard."
450,00:26:51.12,00:26:51.12,"I swear, I can handle this. It's just the after-effect"
451,00:26:54.42,00:26:54.42,"looking at myself. I'm just like, ""Ew!"""
452,00:26:56.96,00:26:56.96,What am I doing to myself? What am I doing?
453,00:27:00.25,00:27:00.25,">> To my body, yeah. >> I never felt so ugly before"
454,00:27:02.88,00:27:02.88,in my life. Stephen came down and he talked
455,00:27:07.12,00:27:07.12,"to me and they made me feel better, but..."
456,00:27:26.21,00:27:26.21,I'm just having a moment. Everyone has their moments out
457,00:27:28.83,00:27:28.83,"here, and today is mine. I'm just more determined now."
458,00:27:31.96,00:27:31.96,I cannot go home empty-handed looking like this.
459,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,(laughs) >> I thought I saw a snake
460,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,"going through the rafters. >> Oh, my gosh!"
461,00:27:51.12,00:27:51.12,>> Oh! >> Coach-- just the biggest joke

465,00:28:29.88,00:28:29.88,">> I heard something about a snake, too."
466,00:28:32.25,00:28:32.25,">> It was a nightmare, a flashback from when I was on the"
467,00:28:35.54,00:28:35.54,Amazon and a snake wrapped around my neck.
468,00:28:38.46,00:28:38.46,I was having that nightmare sometimes; it's reoccurring.
469,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,(indistinct audio) >> That's okay.
470,00:28:43.71,00:28:43.71,"I was just like, well... >> It's one thing to have that"
471,00:28:45.79,00:28:45.79,"dream at home and talking in your sleep, but when..."
472,00:28:50.08,00:28:50.08,">> When it could happen here. >> Last night, Coach woke up"

474,00:28:57.75,00:28:57.75,"and being silly or whatever. Oh, my gosh!"
475,00:29:00.75,00:29:00.75,"Okay, has anybody else seen this?"
476,00:29:02.62,00:29:02.62,>> What? >> That is a snake skin.
477,00:29:04.58,00:29:04.58,">> Oh, gross. >> This wasn't here yesterday."
478,00:29:07.54,00:29:07.54,"Oh, my gosh! A snake has shed his skin"
479,00:29:10.46,00:29:10.46,"right here. Brendan, come see what we found."
480,00:29:14.21,00:29:14.21,">> I told you I saw a snake in there last night, man."
481,00:29:16.67,00:29:16.67,>> I thought you were you were dreaming about it.
482,00:29:18.38,00:29:18.38,">> Maybe it wasn't a dream. >> Oh, my God!"
483,00:29:21.38,00:29:21.38,">> I swear, man, I looked up and I thought I saw a snake"
484,00:29:23.58,00:29:23.58,going through the rafters. >> Really?
485,00:29:25.29,00:29:25.29,>> I'm not kidding. But then I thought it was my
486,00:29:26.88,00:29:26.88,reoccurring dream of being in the Amazon.
487,00:29:29.04,00:29:29.04,>> They're not going to just come up and bite us while we're
488,00:29:30.58,00:29:30.58,"sleeping, would they? >> They could."
489,00:29:32.25,00:29:32.25,">> Okay, this is really freaky. We really got to be careful"
490,00:29:36.67,00:29:36.67,out here. This place is infested with

492,00:29:42.54,00:29:42.54,So I'm being very careful as to where I step.
493,00:29:45.88,00:29:45.88,">> Hey, we're in the wild. That's what happens."
494,00:29:48.50,00:29:48.50,We're part of their environment. >> That just really bums me out.

498,00:30:19.62,00:30:19.62,>> A little jatoba ball. >> Oh!
499,00:30:30.25,00:30:30.25,"Right now, it's probably J.T. leading Jalapao."
500,00:30:34.12,00:30:34.12,And I don't think there's a lot of tension between J.T.
501,00:30:37.08,00:30:37.08,and I right now. >> Oh!
502,00:30:40.38,00:30:40.38,You brought the heat. >> It's kind of nice to have
503,00:30:46.71,00:30:46.71,"somebody you can just let take over and then also, you know,"
504,00:30:50.04,00:30:50.04,the spotlight isn't on you. >> Take a little saliva off
505,00:30:52.21,00:30:52.21,that ball. Maybe it will fly straight.
506,00:31:00.50,00:31:00.50,">> That's at least a triple. >> My kind of ace in the hole,"
507,00:31:04.04,00:31:04.04,"as compared to J.T., is going to be my strategy and"
508,00:31:06.92,00:31:06.92,kind of my social game moving forward.
509,00:31:10.17,00:31:10.17,">> All right, here you go. Single."
510,00:31:18.08,00:31:18.08,>> Is that all? >> That was it.
511,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,"He's more of the basic just kind of provider, you know,"
512,00:31:24.17,00:31:24.17,kind of just alpha male type of guy.
513,00:31:27.38,00:31:27.38,>> A little fungo. >> Oh!
514,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,"Oh, dude. Ow. >> Right back at ya."
515,00:31:39.25,00:31:39.25,You tried to get me off the plate.

517,00:31:52.12,00:31:52.12,>> What in the hell? >> I'd imagine that as we go
518,00:31:57.29,00:31:57.29,"further on in the game, it will get a little tense, and, you"
519,00:32:00.67,00:32:00.67,"know, that's something that I'm prepared for."
520,00:32:03.08,00:32:03.08,I know that's going to happen. >> We better quit or we'll lose
521,00:32:05.96,00:32:05.96,"an eye. >> I think I won, dude."

564,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"now, man to man, I'll never go back on that."
565,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,">> Yeah, me, neither. >> Like I told you, you're the"
566,00:35:19.25,00:35:19.25,most popular guy in this tribe. You'll be the most popular guy
567,00:35:21.71,00:35:21.71,in this game. I ruffle people's feathers.
568,00:35:23.46,00:35:23.46,"You know, that's just me. >> Yeah."
569,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,">> You say the same thing that I do, and everybody laughs."
570,00:35:27.62,00:35:27.62,"I say what you say, and everybody's, like, ""Whoa!"
571,00:35:30.29,00:35:30.29,"That was wrong."" I mean, I-I just wanted to just"
572,00:35:34.79,00:35:34.79,let you know that. >> Yeah. I'm the same way.
573,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,">> Okay. Coach. He's the coach, you know?"
574,00:35:59.04,00:35:59.04,Right now I'm mostly agreeing with what he says.
575,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,"But in this game, I... don't perceive him as being near the"
576,00:36:07.88,00:36:07.88,player that I am. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
577,00:36:15.58,00:36:15.58,">> PROBST: While across the river at Jalapao, J.T. and"
578,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,Stephen were also discussing the future of the game.
579,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,>> I-I feel confident that we could now try to find some
580,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,divisions. There are four of us;
581,00:36:25.21,00:36:25.21,we could find two of them. >> I do like having Stephen
582,00:36:27.29,00:36:27.29,"around. I mean, he's just from such a"
583,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,"different part of the world, and it's hard to imagine we'd ever"
584,00:36:31.71,00:36:31.71,been friends otherwise. But I know we'll always be
585,00:36:34.25,00:36:34.25,friends now. I think you should lay 'em there
586,00:36:36.33,00:36:36.33,and go down there and check it out.
587,00:36:38.25,00:36:38.25,>> J.T. and I have formed a bond.
588,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,I'm excited to be his friend. He is the likeable Everyman with
589,00:36:43.92,00:36:43.92,the sweet Southern drawl and the charming smile.
590,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,">> Now, lay down on your belly right there."
591,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,">> He's showing me how to fish, how to tie a line."
592,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"I think he thinks of me as sort of his sidekick, but is J.T."
593,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,entirely trustworthy? Maybe he's not.
594,00:36:59.17,00:36:59.17,"I mean, you're solid, right? >> Yes, dude."
595,00:37:01.79,00:37:01.79,">> Yeah, okay, me, too. >> No doubt."
596,00:37:03.75,00:37:03.75,"I'm solid with you. And then we go to the merge,"
597,00:37:07.58,00:37:07.58,then we start looking towards the final... final three.
598,00:37:10.46,00:37:10.46,">> Final three. That's it. >> And then, if I win, I take"
599,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,"you. You win, you take me?"
600,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,We go to final two. That'd be awesome.
601,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,">> J.T. has definitely emerged as our tribe leader, and, um, I"
602,00:37:24.25,00:37:24.25,hope to put myself into a power position.
603,00:37:26.38,00:37:26.38,"But I'm not the strongest physical competitor, and so I"
604,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,need to be with J.T. as much as possible.
605,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,"Things are definitely improving for me in this game, but I know"
606,00:37:33.33,00:37:33.33,"better than to, you know, say that with certainty."
607,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,">> PROBST: Later that day, Brendan chose Stephen to join"
608,00:37:42.54,00:37:42.54,him at Exile... hoping to put in place the final
609,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,piece of his Exile alliance with Sierra and Taj.
610,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,">> Whoa, that's enormous. >> That's big, man."
611,00:37:56.38,00:37:56.38,">> Oh, that's kind of disgusting, actually."
612,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,"How tall? What, three, four feet?"
613,00:38:02.08,00:38:02.08,">> Yeah, and there's some that fell off down there."
614,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,">> Oh, man. >> Here."
615,00:38:05.04,00:38:05.04,"It'll be a good boa for you. >> A little, uh, a little"
616,00:38:07.75,00:38:07.75,"decoration? Oh, thank you."
617,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,">> There you go. >> I feel pretty, finally."
618,00:38:10.71,00:38:10.71,">> When I came out to Exile this time, um, I wanted Stephen's"
619,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,trust. I think Stephen didn't
620,00:38:16.12,00:38:16.12,"necessarily believe all this was going on, didn't know me, didn't"
621,00:38:18.79,00:38:18.79,"know Sierra, and so I think it's important that the four of us"
622,00:38:21.62,00:38:21.62,trust each other and know that we're going to the finals
623,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,together. Are you guys solid in your
624,00:38:27.08,00:38:27.08,"tribe? Like, there's no fear of you"
625,00:38:28.58,00:38:28.58,getting eliminated? >> I don't think so.
626,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"I mean, we thought Erinn might be on the outs."
627,00:38:32.21,00:38:32.21,>> Yeah. I needed to be very honest with
628,00:38:34.96,00:38:34.96,"him, and so I tried to tell him as much as could about my tribe,"
629,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,"about how we could work together, just to make him feel"
630,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,"comfortable with that alliance. All right, you ready?"
631,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,">> Mm-hmm. Damn, you're quite the woodman."
632,00:38:59.54,00:38:59.54,"(thunder rumbling) >> Oh, come on, dude."
633,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,"Who's doing this? >> Oh, no!"
634,00:39:11.88,00:39:11.88,>> (laughs): Are you serious? (thunder rumbling)
635,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,I have never been so close to another man.
636,00:39:32.33,00:39:32.33,He and I spooned for all we were worth.
637,00:39:36.58,00:39:36.58,"Oh, my God, it was raining. It was cold."
638,00:39:39.00,00:39:39.00,"Nothing could prepare me for lying huddled against, you know,"
639,00:39:43.83,00:39:43.83,a hunk of-of man. (thunder rumbles)
640,00:39:58.92,00:39:58.92,">> I'm exhausted. I'm... >> Um, the night Steve and I had"
641,00:40:04.00,00:40:04.00,"out here on Exile was probably the worst night I've had, and so"
642,00:40:07.04,00:40:07.04,we huddled up and spooned all night and had a great bonding
643,00:40:10.21,00:40:10.21,experience. Another 20 minutes?
644,00:40:12.08,00:40:12.08,What do we got here? >> It's actually coming over the
645,00:40:15.38,00:40:15.38,"mountain, a little bit. >> Ah, there it is."
646,00:40:19.71,00:40:19.71,">> Ah, feels good, doesn't it? >> Yeah."
647,00:40:21.38,00:40:21.38,And that's the one really cool thing about Exile: it's just a
648,00:40:24.67,00:40:24.67,bonding experience far greater than what... than could happen
649,00:40:27.50,00:40:27.50,back at our tribes. Look how long our shadows are.
650,00:40:30.21,00:40:30.21,">> Oh, God. >> Uh... what kind of shapes"
651,00:40:33.42,00:40:33.42,can you make? (laughs)
652,00:40:35.79,00:40:35.79,>> What I love about our group is we have a four-person
653,00:40:39.21,00:40:39.21,alliance: you have myself; you have Sierra;
654,00:40:41.83,00:40:41.83,"you have Taj and Stephen; and we're all, like,"
655,00:40:44.21,00:40:44.21,"it's, like, it's kind of a motley crew."
656,00:40:46.12,00:40:46.12,"We have two immunity idols. We have the control, and, you"
657,00:40:49.04,00:40:49.04,"know, hopefully, it'll be smooth sailing from there."
658,00:40:51.58,00:40:51.58,"Can you make a... I guess, a ""T""?"
659,00:40:54.29,00:40:54.29,">> A cross, yeah. >> ""H."""
660,00:40:59.21,00:40:59.21,Sort of. >> I've just met Brendan.
661,00:41:01.38,00:41:01.38,We've bonded because we have... we have spooned quite a bit.
662,00:41:04.17,00:41:04.17,And I'm glad right now that I'm in his alliance.
663,00:41:06.96,00:41:06.96,"But there's a lot that's going on in my tribe right now, and my"
664,00:41:10.04,00:41:10.04,priority has to be to make sure that I get to the merge in a
665,00:41:12.92,00:41:12.92,really strong place. >> No more cuddling once we get
666,00:41:15.50,00:41:15.50,"back to the merge tribe, yeah. >> Much as I would love to."
667,00:41:19.67,00:41:19.67,(laughs): Yeah. >> PROBST: 11 castaways are
668,00:41:28.00,00:41:28.00,"left. Of the first five votes,"
669,00:41:30.12,00:41:30.12,three have been blindsides. What will happen when the
670,00:41:34.12,00:41:34.12,challenges get more intense... the rewards bigger...
671,00:41:39.29,00:41:39.29,the stakes higher? >> You are such a liar!
672,00:41:41.42,00:41:41.42,>> PROBST: Will friendships and alliances that formed early
673,00:41:44.04,00:41:44.04,continue through the game? And what twists await?
674,00:41:47.71,00:41:47.71,(yelling) >> PROBST: Join us next time...
675,00:41:51.12,00:41:51.12,as the adventure continues. (bird screeches)
676,00:42:01.88,00:42:01.88,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
677,00:42:08.29,00:42:08.29,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
678,00:42:12.83,00:42:12.83,Timbira turns on Coach. >> We all were frustrated with
679,00:42:15.62,00:42:15.62,Coach. >> And the truth shall set you
680,00:42:18.12,00:42:18.12,free! >> PROBST: And at Jalapao...
681,00:42:19.79,00:42:19.79,>> We're going to merge. >> We're going to the end.
682,00:42:22.08,00:42:22.08,>> PROBST: ...the tribe turns on each other.
683,00:42:25.50,00:42:25.50,>> It's terrible. I'm going to hell.
684,00:42:33.54,00:42:33.54,>> Remember when you kind of... >> Yeah.
685,00:42:36.38,00:42:36.38,">> ...when you wouldn't stop? >> Yeah, I remember."
686,00:42:39.08,00:42:39.08,When can we do it again? >> You'd probably have to give
687,00:42:42.75,00:42:42.75,"me, like, ten minutes or something."
688,00:42:44.42,00:42:44.42,>> Ten minutes in between? >> Yep.
689,00:42:46.75,00:42:46.75,>> You're a stud. >> I know.
690,00:42:48.25,00:42:48.25,I can go all night. (laughs)
