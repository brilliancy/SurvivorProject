114,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,Okay.Because another thing I think
115,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,that they're probablyunderestimating about me is
116,00:07:26.58,00:07:26.58,that I look fat.But I'm not really fat.
117,00:07:31.71,00:07:31.71,"I'm muscular.So, when I'm winning challenges,"
118,00:07:36.12,00:07:36.12,they won't have a reason to tryto kick me off.
119,00:07:38.21,00:07:38.21,They can't.I'm going to be so good at this
120,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,they won't be ready for me.>> Whoo!

130,00:08:46.21,00:08:46.21,>> I think it's going to be alot harder than anybody
131,00:08:48.04,00:08:48.04,realizes out here.Foraging for food is going to be
132,00:08:50.92,00:08:50.92,difficult.Dang.

304,00:19:01.96,00:19:01.96,I don't think she's going tofully realize her potential

321,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,stupid.I think he has higher
322,00:20:04.25,00:20:04.25,expectations for me than hedoes for other people.
323,00:20:06.67,00:20:06.67,He thinks of me as a strongfemale.
324,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,You're going to be harder onthat one just so that they play
325,00:20:12.21,00:20:12.21,harder in a game.And I think that's what...
326,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,"where his mind's really at.And I could very well be wrong,"
327,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,but I think there's some goodintent behind it.
328,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,">> Thanks, Coach.>> PROBST: Later that day, at"
329,00:20:28.08,00:20:28.08,"Jalapao, the muck and grime ofthe game gave Sydney another"

563,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"now, man to man, I'll never goback on that."
564,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,">> Yeah, me, neither.>> Like I told you, you're the"
565,00:35:19.25,00:35:19.25,most popular guy in this tribe.You'll be the most popular guy
566,00:35:21.71,00:35:21.71,in this game.I ruffle people's feathers.
567,00:35:23.46,00:35:23.46,"You know, that's just me.>> Yeah."
568,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,">> You say the same thing that Ido, and everybody laughs."
569,00:35:27.62,00:35:27.62,"I say what you say, andeverybody's, like, ""Whoa!"
570,00:35:30.29,00:35:30.29,"That was wrong.""I mean, I-I just wanted to just"
571,00:35:34.79,00:35:34.79,let you know that.>> Yeah. I'm the same way.
572,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,">> Okay.Coach. He's the coach, you know?"
573,00:35:59.04,00:35:59.04,Right now I'm mostly agreeingwith what he says.
574,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,"But in this game, I... don'tperceive him as being near the"
575,00:36:07.88,00:36:07.88,player that I am.â™ª â™ª
576,00:36:15.58,00:36:15.58,">> PROBST: While across theriver at Jalapao, J.T. and"
577,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,Stephen were also discussing thefuture of the game.
578,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,>> I-I feel confident that wecould now try to find some
579,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,divisions.There are four of us;
580,00:36:25.21,00:36:25.21,we could find two of them.>> I do like having Stephen
581,00:36:27.29,00:36:27.29,"around.I mean, he's just from such a"
582,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,"different part of the world, andit's hard to imagine we'd ever"
583,00:36:31.71,00:36:31.71,been friends otherwise.But I know we'll always be
584,00:36:34.25,00:36:34.25,friends now.I think you should lay 'em there
585,00:36:36.33,00:36:36.33,and go down there and check itout.
586,00:36:38.25,00:36:38.25,>> J.T. and I have formed abond.
587,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,I'm excited to be his friend.He is the likeable Everyman with
588,00:36:43.92,00:36:43.92,the sweet Southern drawl and thecharming smile.
589,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,">> Now, lay down on your bellyright there."
590,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,">> He's showing me how to fish,how to tie a line."
591,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"I think he thinks of me as sortof his sidekick, but is J.T."
592,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,entirely trustworthy?Maybe he's not.
593,00:36:59.17,00:36:59.17,"I mean, you're solid, right?>> Yes, dude."
594,00:37:01.79,00:37:01.79,">> Yeah, okay, me, too.>> No doubt."
595,00:37:03.75,00:37:03.75,"I'm solid with you.And then we go to the merge,"
596,00:37:07.58,00:37:07.58,then we start looking towardsthe final... final three.
597,00:37:10.46,00:37:10.46,">> Final three. That's it.>> And then, if I win, I take"
598,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,"you.You win, you take me?"
599,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,We go to final two.That'd be awesome.
600,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,">> J.T. has definitely emergedas our tribe leader, and, um, I"
601,00:37:24.25,00:37:24.25,hope to put myself into a powerposition.
602,00:37:26.38,00:37:26.38,"But I'm not the strongestphysical competitor, and so I"
603,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,need to be with J.T. as much aspossible.
604,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,"Things are definitely improvingfor me in this game, but I know"
605,00:37:33.33,00:37:33.33,"better than to, you know, saythat with certainty."
606,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,">> PROBST: Later that day,Brendan chose Stephen to join"
607,00:37:42.54,00:37:42.54,him at Exile...hoping to put in place the final

614,00:38:05.04,00:38:05.04,"It'll be a good boa for you.>> A little, uh, a little"
615,00:38:07.75,00:38:07.75,"decoration?Oh, thank you."
616,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,">> There you go.>> I feel pretty, finally."
617,00:38:10.71,00:38:10.71,">> When I came out to Exile thistime, um, I wanted Stephen's"
618,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,trust.I think Stephen didn't

620,00:38:18.79,00:38:18.79,"know Sierra, and so I think it'simportant that the four of us"

624,00:38:28.58,00:38:28.58,getting eliminated?>> I don't think so.
625,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"I mean, we thought Erinn mightbe on the outs."
626,00:38:32.21,00:38:32.21,>> Yeah.I needed to be very honest with
627,00:38:34.96,00:38:34.96,"him, and so I tried to tell himas much as could about my tribe,"
628,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,"about how we could worktogether, just to make him feel"
629,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,"comfortable with that alliance.All right, you ready?"
630,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,">> Mm-hmm.Damn, you're quite the woodman."

634,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,I have never been so close toanother man.
635,00:39:32.33,00:39:32.33,He and I spooned for all we wereworth.
636,00:39:36.58,00:39:36.58,"Oh, my God, it was raining.It was cold."
637,00:39:39.00,00:39:39.00,"Nothing could prepare me forlying huddled against, you know,"

639,00:39:58.92,00:39:58.92,">> I'm exhausted. I'm...>> Um, the night Steve and I had"
640,00:40:04.00,00:40:04.00,"out here on Exile was probablythe worst night I've had, and so"
641,00:40:07.04,00:40:07.04,we huddled up and spooned allnight and had a great bonding
642,00:40:10.21,00:40:10.21,experience.Another 20 minutes?
643,00:40:12.08,00:40:12.08,What do we got here?>> It's actually coming over the

646,00:40:21.38,00:40:21.38,And that's the one really coolthing about Exile: it's just a
647,00:40:24.67,00:40:24.67,bonding experience far greaterthan what... than could happen
648,00:40:27.50,00:40:27.50,back at our tribes.Look how long our shadows are.
649,00:40:30.21,00:40:30.21,">> Oh, God.>> Uh... what kind of shapes"
