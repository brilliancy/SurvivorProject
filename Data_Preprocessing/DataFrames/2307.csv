865,00:27:33.80,00:27:33.80,I REALLY DON'T.
866,00:27:34.93,00:27:34.93,SO WE GET BACK TO CAMP AFTER
867,00:27:36.63,00:27:36.63,"THIS DEVASTATING LOSS, WHICH I"
868,00:27:38.07,00:27:38.07,"GUESS, APPARENTLY, I CAUSED."
869,00:27:39.43,00:27:39.43,"YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE"
870,00:27:41.30,00:27:41.30,"AN OUTCAST ON MY TRIBE, BUT THIS"
871,00:27:43.17,00:27:43.17,WAS A REAL-- A HUGE-- THIS WAS--
872,00:27:46.13,00:27:46.13,THIS WAS A NEW LEVEL OF
873,00:27:49.43,00:27:49.43,"OFTRASCIZZIM, AND IT FELT"
874,00:27:50.50,00:27:50.50,HORRIBLE.
875,00:27:51.10,00:27:51.10,THAT LOSS JUST KILLED ME.
876,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,"LIKE I'M SAYING, IF YOU WANT"
877,00:27:54.47,00:27:54.47,"TO VENT AT ME, I'M TAKING IT"
878,00:27:57.10,00:27:57.10,ALL.
879,00:27:57.87,00:27:57.87,IT'S ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO
880,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,REDEMPTION ISLAND.
881,00:27:59.97,00:27:59.97,AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD
882,00:28:01.47,00:28:01.47,"DECIDE AS A GROUP, BECAUSE--"
883,00:28:04.03,00:28:04.03,WE HAVE TO DECIDE AS A GROUP
884,00:28:06.63,00:28:06.63,AND THEY HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT.
885,00:28:08.63,00:28:08.63,THIS IS IT.
886,00:28:09.73,00:28:09.73,THIS IS THE REAL DEAL RIGHT NOW.
887,00:28:11.23,00:28:11.23,"THAT MOMENT, THE HIGH I HAD"
888,00:28:12.57,00:28:12.57,BEEN EXPERIENCING FROM THE
889,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27,"KNOWLEDGE THAT, REALLY, I WASN'T"
890,00:28:14.90,00:28:14.90,GOING ONLY IN ANY EVENT.
891,00:28:16.43,00:28:16.43,"I WAS SAFE, NOBODY WAS GOING TO"
892,00:28:17.67,00:28:17.67,KICK ME OFF.
893,00:28:18.63,00:28:18.63,"THAT INVOLVEMENTED INSTANTLY,"
894,00:28:20.23,00:28:20.23,AND I KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT I
895,00:28:22.10,00:28:22.10,WAS THE NEXT TARING.
896,00:28:23.13,00:28:23.13,"YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY"
897,00:28:24.97,00:28:24.97,"TCOCHRAN, BUT YOU LOST IT FOR"
898,00:28:26.00,00:28:26.00,US.
899,00:28:26.70,00:28:26.70,AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY YOU
900,00:28:27.80,00:28:27.80,"LOST IT FOR US, BUT IT WAS-- IT"
901,00:28:29.63,00:28:29.63,WAS A HUGE-- IT WAS A HUGE
902,00:28:31.83,00:28:31.83,ERROR.
903,00:28:32.53,00:28:32.53,AND IT ENDED UP COSTING US THE
904,00:28:34.77,00:28:34.77,WIN.
905,00:28:35.43,00:28:35.43,I'M WILLING TO DO WHATEVER.
906,00:28:36.67,00:28:36.67,I FEEL HORRIBLE.
907,00:28:40.43,00:28:40.43,"AND, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD BE HELD"
908,00:28:42.03,00:28:42.03,ACCOUNTABLE.
909,00:28:42.63,00:28:42.63,IT'S A RISKY MOVE TO SEND
910,00:28:43.80,00:28:43.80,COCHRAN TO REDEMPTION.
911,00:28:45.17,00:28:45.17,IT'S A RISKIER MOVE TO SEND ME
912,00:28:48.13,00:28:48.13,TO REDEMPTION AND HAVE THE MERGE
913,00:28:50.10,00:28:50.10,BE DELAYED ONE MORE CHALLENGE.
914,00:28:51.80,00:28:51.80,COCHRAN VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO
915,00:28:54.33,00:28:54.33,REDEMPTION.
916,00:28:55.03,00:28:55.03,IT'S GOING TO BE HIS CHANCE TO
917,00:28:56.20,00:28:56.20,REDEEM HIMSELF.
918,00:28:59.27,00:28:59.27,"COCHRAN, WE ALL BELIEVE YOU CAN"
919,00:29:00.27,00:29:00.27,DO IT.
920,00:29:00.67,00:29:00.67,WE DO.
921,00:29:01.33,00:29:01.33,YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN
922,00:29:02.40,00:29:02.40,DO IT.
923,00:29:02.90,00:29:02.90,THAT'S THE KEY.
924,00:29:03.47,00:29:03.47,BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE IN
925,00:29:04.87,00:29:04.87,"YOURSELF, MAN."
926,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,"YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THE"
927,00:29:08.07,00:29:08.07,WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.
928,00:29:09.60,00:29:09.60,IT'S NOT WORDS OF
929,00:29:11.87,00:29:11.87,ENCOURAGEMENT UPON IT IS THE
930,00:29:14.10,00:29:14.10,IDEA OF REF DEMPTION.
931,00:29:15.70,00:29:15.70,IT REALLY IS.
932,00:29:16.47,00:29:16.47,IT'S TIME TO REDEEM.
933,00:29:17.63,00:29:17.63,"INSTEAD OF SENDING OZZY, THE"
934,00:29:21.40,00:29:21.40,TROJAN COURSE TO REDEMPTION

936,00:29:24.83,00:29:24.83,THEY'RE SENDING THE COURT
937,00:29:26.10,00:29:26.10,JESTER.
938,00:29:26.70,00:29:26.70,AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
939,00:29:27.67,00:29:27.67,SUPPOSED TO BE BESIDES A FUNNY

941,00:29:31.80,00:29:31.80,AROUND IN A COMICAL MANNER.
942,00:29:33.43,00:29:33.43,IT'S NOT GOING TO WIN THE
943,00:29:34.53,00:29:34.53,CHALLENGE AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT
944,00:29:36.10,00:29:36.10,GOING TO GET THAT MANY LAUGHS SO
945,00:29:37.30,00:29:37.30,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HOPING
946,00:29:38.83,00:29:38.83,FOR.
947,00:29:39.40,00:29:39.40,FEEL IT IN YOUR HEART.
948,00:29:40.23,00:29:40.23,YOU CAN WIN.
949,00:29:42.13,00:29:42.13,EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN
950,00:29:43.37,00:29:43.37,ANTICIPATE.
951,00:29:43.93,00:29:43.93,"I MEAN, REALLY, DON'T BE"
952,00:29:45.47,00:29:45.47,AFRAID.
953,00:29:46.13,00:29:46.13,YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH FEAR OUT.
954,00:29:46.83,00:29:46.83,EVERYBODY WAS ON ABOARD WITH
955,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,"VOTING ME OFF, AND WHAT MADE IT"
956,00:29:50.47,00:29:50.47,WORSE WAS THEY HAD THIS KIND OF
957,00:29:52.50,00:29:52.50,WEIRD KUMBAYA RATIONALE FOR
958,00:29:54.10,00:29:54.10,VOTING ME OFF THAT ONLY

961,00:29:58.63,00:29:58.63,I DON'T NEED TO BE A HERO AT
962,00:30:00.10,00:30:00.10,REDEMPTION ISLAND.
963,00:30:00.80,00:30:00.80,I DON'T NEED TO BE THE PERSON
964,00:30:01.93,00:30:01.93,THAT SAVES MY TRIBE.
965,00:30:03.00,00:30:03.00,I'M NOT HERE TO BE A HERO.
966,00:30:04.53,00:30:04.53,I'M HERE TO MAKE A AS FAR AS I
967,00:30:08.47,00:30:08.47,"CAN, WHETHER THAT MEANS"
968,00:30:10.33,00:30:10.33,SLITHERING ON THE GROUND.
969,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,I DON'T WANT TO SHINE RIGHT NOW.

977,00:30:24.90,00:30:24.90,THAT'S IT.
978,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,I'M DONE.
979,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN PULL

985,00:30:59.33,00:30:59.33,MY HEAD HURTS.
986,00:31:01.63,00:31:01.63,I COULD NOT SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
987,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67,I BLEW IT.
988,00:31:04.67,00:31:04.67,I'M SORRY.
989,00:31:06.03,00:31:06.03,I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
990,00:31:07.23,00:31:07.23,YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE
991,00:31:08.40,00:31:08.40,TO ME.
992,00:31:08.97,00:31:08.97,I'M JUST EMBARRASSED.
993,00:31:10.00,00:31:10.00,THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING I'M
994,00:31:11.80,00:31:11.80,"FEELING, REALLY."
995,00:31:12.43,00:31:12.43,THAT'S WHY I FEEL LIKE THE
996,00:31:13.63,00:31:13.63,NOTION OF REDEMPTION ISLAND
997,00:31:14.33,00:31:14.33,"TAKES ON, LIKE, A LITERAL."
998,00:31:18.57,00:31:18.57,RIGHT?
999,00:31:19.13,00:31:19.13,IT'S TO REDEEM YOURSELF.
1000,00:31:20.17,00:31:20.17,YEAH.

1008,00:31:39.03,00:31:39.03,AND LAST NIGHT I HAD SOME CRAZY
1009,00:31:41.07,00:31:41.07,DREAMS ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING WHAT
1010,00:31:42.33,00:31:42.33,I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO.
1011,00:31:44.63,00:31:44.63,I HAD TO BRING THE IDOL OUT OF
1012,00:31:46.63,00:31:46.63,"MY HIDING SPOT, JUST SO"
1013,00:31:49.03,00:31:49.03,EVERYBODY REALLY KNOWS THEY
1014,00:31:50.20,00:31:50.20,ACTUALLY DO HAVE IT.
1015,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,I MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A GRAND
1016,00:31:56.23,00:31:56.23,ENTRANCE.
1017,00:31:56.93,00:31:56.93,EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THIS IS
1018,00:31:57.87,00:31:57.87,"COCHRAN'S OPPORTUNITY, THAT HE"
1019,00:31:59.70,00:31:59.70,SHOULD GOING TO REDEMPTION AND
1020,00:32:02.07,00:32:02.07,REDEEM HIMSELF BUT I CAME TO
1021,00:32:03.33,00:32:03.33,"REDEEM MYSELF, SO IT'S MY"
1022,00:32:04.90,00:32:04.90,"OPPORTUNITY, REALLY."
1023,00:32:05.63,00:32:05.63,THE QUESTION IS WILL THE TRIBE
1024,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,GO ALONG WITH MY IDEA?
1025,00:32:13.53,00:32:13.53,WOW.
1026,00:32:15.63,00:32:15.63,YOU'RE AMAZING.
1027,00:32:17.07,00:32:17.07,THAT'S IT.
1028,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,YOU WANT TO TOUCH IT?
1029,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,"YEAH, GIVE IT TO ME, MAN."
1030,00:32:23.27,00:32:23.27,"SERIOUSLY, I'LL TAKE IT."
1031,00:32:27.07,00:32:27.07,REALLY?
1032,00:32:27.63,00:32:27.63,WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
1033,00:32:28.53,00:32:28.53,I REALLY-- I'M KIND OF
1034,00:32:29.97,00:32:29.97,THINKING I SHOULD GO TO
1035,00:32:32.27,00:32:32.27,REDEMPTION.
1036,00:32:32.93,00:32:32.93,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, COCHRAN?"
1037,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,"IT'SA-- YOU KNOW, I AGREE THE"
1038,00:32:39.80,00:32:39.80,WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SAY IT
1039,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,SHOULD BE ME.
1040,00:32:42.90,00:32:42.90,I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CONFIDENCE
1041,00:32:44.23,00:32:44.23,THEY WILL DO WELL.
1042,00:32:45.63,00:32:45.63,OZZY COMES WALTZING INTO THE
1043,00:32:48.03,00:32:48.03,CAMP WITH THIS PEARLY NECKLACE
1044,00:32:49.90,00:32:49.90,AROUND HIS NECK SAYING VOTE ME
1045,00:32:52.27,00:32:52.27,OUT.
1046,00:32:52.97,00:32:52.97,SEND ME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
1047,00:32:53.73,00:32:53.73,IT WAS LIKE THE GOSPEL.
1048,00:32:54.90,00:32:54.90,I COULD HAVE DIED RIGHT THERE.
1049,00:32:56.33,00:32:56.33,WHAT MAXES YOU THINK THIS?
1050,00:32:58.97,00:32:58.97,I JUST THINK THAT I'VE GOT
1051,00:33:00.77,00:33:00.77,BETTER ODDS.
1052,00:33:02.37,00:33:02.37,"I DON'T THINK SO, MAN."
1053,00:33:03.73,00:33:03.73,I DON'T KNOW.
1054,00:33:05.23,00:33:05.23,THE REACTION TO OZZY
1055,00:33:07.03,00:33:07.03,ANNOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE
1056,00:33:08.03,00:33:08.03,WILLING TO GO TO REDEMPTION
1057,00:33:09.50,00:33:09.50,ISLAND WAS MET WITH SOME
1058,00:33:12.10,00:33:12.10,"OPPOSITION, SO I DON'T KNOW"
1059,00:33:13.07,00:33:13.07,WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
1060,00:33:14.63,00:33:14.63,AND IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.
1061,00:33:16.87,00:33:16.87,MY PIECE WITH IT IS I THINK
1062,00:33:18.73,00:33:18.73,EVERYONE SHOULD STAND UP FOR
1063,00:33:21.37,00:33:21.37,THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND THAT'S
1064,00:33:22.27,00:33:22.27,WHAT I DO IN LIFE AND THAT'S THE
1065,00:33:24.07,00:33:24.07,REASON I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH IT.
1066,00:33:25.70,00:33:25.70,OZZY IS TALKING ABOUT GOING
1067,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50,TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
1068,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,I WON'T AGREE WITH IT.
1069,00:33:30.70,00:33:30.70,WHAT WORRIES ME MOST ABOUT THE
1070,00:33:31.97,00:33:31.97,PLAN IS THAT THE MERGE IS NOT
1071,00:33:33.07,00:33:33.07,GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE WE THINK IT
1072,00:33:34.77,00:33:34.77,IS.
1073,00:33:35.43,00:33:35.43,WE ARE ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR
1074,00:33:37.03,00:33:37.03,"WEAKEST LINK, AND THAT'S"
1075,00:33:38.47,00:33:38.47,COCHRAN.
1076,00:33:39.17,00:33:39.17,SO COCHRAN'S LEFT TO BASICALLY
1077,00:33:40.47,00:33:40.47,PULL THE REST OF THE WEIGHT THAT
1078,00:33:42.07,00:33:42.07,"OZZY LEFT BEHIND, AND I DON'T"
1079,00:33:43.93,00:33:43.93,REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH HOPE WE
1080,00:33:46.37,00:33:46.37,HAVE FOR ANOTHER TEAM CHALLENGE.
1081,00:33:48.07,00:33:48.07,AND I KNOW KEITH DOESN'T LIKE
1082,00:33:49.37,00:33:49.37,THIS IDEA.
1083,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,I UNDERSTAND WHAT KEITH'S
1084,00:33:52.07,00:33:52.07,SAYING.
1085,00:33:52.63,00:33:52.63,AND I FEEL THAT WAY VERY
1086,00:33:54.07,00:33:54.07,STRONGLY AS WELL.
1087,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,IF WE'RE WRONG ABOUT THEIR
1088,00:33:57.13,00:33:57.13,BEING A MERGE AFTER THE NEXT
1089,00:33:58.27,00:33:58.27,"REDEMPTION ISLAND, THE BIGGEST"
1090,00:33:59.37,00:33:59.37,DEAL WOULD BE IF WE HAVE ANOTHER
1091,00:34:01.07,00:34:01.07,CHALLENGE AND WE'RE DOWN OZZY
1092,00:34:02.30,00:34:02.30,"AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, DAWN'S OUR"
1093,00:34:04.67,00:34:04.67,"THIRD GUY, COCHRAN WOULD BE OUR"
1094,00:34:06.63,00:34:06.63,FOURTH GUY.
1095,00:34:08.77,00:34:08.77,SCARY POSITION TO BE IN.
1096,00:34:32.47,00:34:32.47,"Jeff: SO, OZZY, AT THE END"
1097,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,"OF THE HALF THE CHALLENGE, THERE"
1098,00:34:35.27,00:34:35.27,WAS A LOT OF EMOTION.
1099,00:34:37.33,00:34:37.33,WAS THERE ANY FINGER POINTING
1100,00:34:38.57,00:34:38.57,WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO CAMP?
1101,00:34:40.23,00:34:40.23,( LAUGHS ).
1102,00:34:40.93,00:34:40.93,"YEAH, THERE WAS A LOT OF"
1103,00:34:42.30,00:34:42.30,"EMOTION, AND A LOT OF FINGER"
1104,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,"POINTING, MOST OF THE FINGERS"
1105,00:34:45.57,00:34:45.57,WENT TO COCHRAN.
1106,00:34:47.97,00:34:47.97,"Jeff: COCHRAN, WHAT"
1107,00:34:49.47,00:34:49.47,HAPPENED?
1108,00:34:50.10,00:34:50.10,"I MEAN, I RECOGNIZED THERE"
1109,00:34:51.13,00:34:51.13,WAS A PROBLEM WHEN DAWN AND
1110,00:34:52.70,00:34:52.70,KEITH RETURNED AND THE ROPE WAS
1111,00:34:54.67,00:34:54.67,ALL TANGLED UP AND THAT'S WHEN I
1112,00:34:56.47,00:34:56.47,STARTED TO PANIC BECAUSE I
1113,00:34:57.87,00:34:57.87,WASN'T SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
1114,00:34:59.23,00:34:59.23,IN A FAST WAY.
1115,00:35:00.57,00:35:00.57,"I REMEMBER LOOKING UP AT JIM,"
1116,00:35:04.57,00:35:04.57,AND JUST BEING BLANK.

1118,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,WORST NIGHTMARE.
1119,00:35:09.83,00:35:09.83,IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
1120,00:35:10.87,00:35:10.87,"Jeff: SO, JIM, YOU SAW"
1121,00:35:12.97,00:35:12.97,COCHRAN PANICKING.
1122,00:35:14.13,00:35:14.13,COCHRAN HAD GOTTEN TO A POINT
1123,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53,OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THE TWO
1124,00:35:17.73,00:35:17.73,WERE TANGLED UP AND HE HAD KIND
1125,00:35:19.50,00:35:19.50,OF THROWN HIS HANDS UP IN-- THIS

1127,00:35:23.73,00:35:23.73,"Jeff: COCHRAN, HAVE YOU"
1128,00:35:24.77,00:35:24.77,FOUND YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS
1129,00:35:26.03,00:35:26.03,LIKE THIS WHERE YOU'RE MAYBE OUT

1132,00:35:31.27,00:35:31.27,"I'M USUALLY PRETTY CALM, COOL,"
1133,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,AND COLLECTED.
1134,00:35:34.53,00:35:34.53,THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR
1135,00:35:36.37,00:35:36.37,ME.
1136,00:35:36.93,00:35:36.93,IT WAS A HEARTBREAKING

1140,00:35:43.73,00:35:43.73,IT'S MIXED EMOTIONS IN THAT
1141,00:35:45.03,00:35:45.03,WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING DOWN IN
1142,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03,NUMBER BUT WE'RE HOPING

1152,00:36:00.03,00:36:00.03,ISLAND CAN WIN THAT DUEL AND
1153,00:36:01.57,00:36:01.57,SEND HOME CHRISTINE AND RE-ENTER

1163,00:36:21.30,00:36:21.30,BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING
1164,00:36:22.37,00:36:22.37,"ON ONE HAND, COCHRAN, COCHRAN,"
1165,00:36:25.40,00:36:25.40,"COCHRAN, COCHRAN, COX RAN?"

1167,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,Jeff: WHY IS HE GOING TO
1168,00:36:28.97,00:36:28.97,PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE IF YOU
1169,00:36:30.37,00:36:30.37,VOTE HIM OUT?
1170,00:36:30.90,00:36:30.90,OF COURSE.
1171,00:36:31.73,00:36:31.73,"THE THING ABOUT IT IS, JEFF, I'M"
1172,00:36:34.13,00:36:34.13,PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE.
1173,00:36:36.23,00:36:36.23,Jeff: YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR
1174,00:36:37.13,00:36:37.13,LIFE ON THE LINE.
1175,00:36:37.83,00:36:37.83,YES.
1176,00:36:38.47,00:36:38.47,Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE
1177,00:36:39.63,00:36:39.63,GOING TO GO TO REDEMPTION
1178,00:36:40.73,00:36:40.73,ISLAND.
1179,00:36:41.00,00:36:41.00,YES.
1180,00:36:41.70,00:36:41.70,YOU CAN BASICALLY SAY I HAD A
1181,00:36:43.20,00:36:43.20,DREAM.
1182,00:36:43.63,00:36:43.63,I SAW THE MERGE.
1183,00:36:44.37,00:36:44.37,AND I SAW MY CHANCE AT MY OWN
1184,00:36:47.53,00:36:47.53,"REDEMPTION, WHICH HAS BEEN"
1185,00:36:48.53,00:36:48.53,HAUNTING ME SINCE THE LAST TIME
1186,00:36:49.53,00:36:49.53,I PLAYED.
1187,00:36:50.67,00:36:50.67,AND THAT'S BY NOT PLAYING THE
1188,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"IDOL, BY NOT LISTENING TO MY"
1189,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,SENSES AND NOT LISTENING TO MY
1190,00:36:54.97,00:36:54.97,HEART AND MY GUT.
1191,00:36:56.00,00:36:56.00,AND THIS TIME MY HEART AND MY
1192,00:36:57.97,00:36:57.97,GUT IS SAYING GET YOUR ASS TO
1193,00:37:00.13,00:37:00.13,REDEMPTION ISLAND AND PROVE TO
1194,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,YOUR TRIBE THAT YOU ARE WORTH
1195,00:37:02.33,00:37:02.33,KEEPING IN THIS GAME.
1196,00:37:03.30,00:37:03.30,THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO NOT
1197,00:37:06.13,00:37:06.13,ONLY MAKE THE BALLSIEST MOVE I
1198,00:37:07.57,00:37:07.57,"COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF, BUT TO"
1199,00:37:08.77,00:37:08.77,"PLAY THE BIGGEST, CRAZIEST GAME"
1200,00:37:10.43,00:37:10.43,"I WANT TO PLAY, AND NOT ONLY DO"
1201,00:37:12.13,00:37:12.13,I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT I HAD
1202,00:37:14.00,00:37:14.00,THE IDOL.
1203,00:37:17.00,00:37:17.00,Jeff: YOU HAVE THE HIDDEN
1204,00:37:18.90,00:37:18.90,IMMUNITY IDOL?
1205,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,YEAH.
1206,00:37:19.80,00:37:19.80,Jeff: AND THIS ISN'T NEWS
1207,00:37:21.17,00:37:21.17,TO ANYBODY.
1208,00:37:22.47,00:37:22.47,SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE IDOL?
1209,00:37:25.17,00:37:25.17,I GIVE THE IDOL UP.
1210,00:37:26.80,00:37:26.80,AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE IT
1211,00:37:28.27,00:37:28.27,GETS INTERESTING.
1212,00:37:29.00,00:37:29.00,I'M GOING TO MAKE UP A STORY.
1213,00:37:30.30,00:37:30.30,"I'M GOING TO TELL CHRISTINE,"
1214,00:37:32.23,00:37:32.23,"THAT COCHRAN, THE LITTLE SMART"
1215,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,WEASEL HE IS THAT HAS BEEN TO
1216,00:37:35.60,00:37:35.60,HARVARD LAW AND WATCHES THE GAME
1217,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,"RELIGIOUSLY, FOUND THE IDOL,"
1218,00:37:39.37,00:37:39.37,"KEPT IT FROM US, WE GO TO VOTE"
1219,00:37:40.87,00:37:40.87,"HIM OUT, HE WHIPS OUT THE IDOL,"
1220,00:37:42.77,00:37:42.77,"SEE YOU LATER, OZZY."
1221,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"NOT ONLY IS COCHRAN THE VILLAIN,"
1222,00:37:46.73,00:37:46.73,BUT HE'S NOW THE DOUBLE AGENT.
1223,00:37:48.83,00:37:48.83,SO I THINK THAT THAT GIVES US
1224,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,THE BEST SHOT AT TAKING THEM BY
1225,00:37:52.93,00:37:52.93,SURPRISE AND POSSIBLY GETTING IN
1226,00:37:54.20,00:37:54.20,FRONT OF THIS GAME.
1227,00:37:56.47,00:37:56.47,Jeff: WHAT IF WE DON'T
1228,00:37:57.77,00:37:57.77,MERGE TOMORROW?
1229,00:37:58.43,00:37:58.43,THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
1230,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,WE DON'T MERGE.
1231,00:38:00.40,00:38:00.40,AND THAT THESE GUYS GO TO
1232,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,ANOTHER CHALLENGE WITHOUT ME.
1233,00:38:03.87,00:38:03.87,BUT AT LEAST I'VE GONE OUT ON MY
1234,00:38:05.80,00:38:05.80,"TERMS, AND I HAVEN'T GONE OUT ON"
1235,00:38:07.77,00:38:07.77,SOMEONE ELSE'S TERMS LIKE LAST
1236,00:38:10.40,00:38:10.40,TIME.
1237,00:38:11.03,00:38:11.03,Jeff: LET ME OFFER ANOTHER
1238,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,ARGUMENT.
1239,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,IF YOU DON'T WIN THE DUEL
1240,00:38:13.47,00:38:13.47,"TOMORROW, YOU GO OUT A BIGGER"
1241,00:38:14.90,00:38:14.90,FOOL THAN YOU DID LAST TIME.
1242,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,YEAH.
1243,00:38:18.70,00:38:18.70,"Jeff: KEITH, ANY"
1244,00:38:20.40,00:38:20.40,RESERVATIONS AT ALL ABOUT THIS?
1245,00:38:21.90,00:38:21.90,I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE
1246,00:38:23.53,00:38:23.53,MOST VOCAL.
1247,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,I THINK THIS IS COCHRAN'S TIME
1248,00:38:26.40,00:38:26.40,TO REDEEM HIMSELF.
1249,00:38:27.70,00:38:27.70,AND IT'S HIS CHANCE TO KIND OF
1250,00:38:29.30,00:38:29.30,PROVE HIS WORTH TO THE TRIBE.
1251,00:38:31.07,00:38:31.07,"Jeff: WHITNEY, WHAT'S YOUR"
1252,00:38:32.27,00:38:32.27,TAKE ON THIS?
1253,00:38:32.93,00:38:32.93,"YOU KNOW, OZZY'S ONE OF OUR"
1254,00:38:35.50,00:38:35.50,STRONGEST PLAYERS.
1255,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,IF WE DO HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE
1256,00:38:37.77,00:38:37.77,"BEFORE THE MERGE HAPPENS, WE'RE"
1257,00:38:38.97,00:38:38.97,NOT AT OUR 100% WITHOUT OZZY.
1258,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,"Jeff: JIM, WORST THING THAT"
1259,00:38:43.63,00:38:43.63,HAPPENS TOMORROW MORNING WHEN
1260,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,YOU WAKE UP?
1261,00:38:45.93,00:38:45.93,"OZZY LOSES AND WE HAVE TO GO,"
1262,00:38:48.97,00:38:48.97,"THE FIVE OF US STRONG, AGAINST"
1263,00:38:50.43,00:38:50.43,THE SIX OF THEM.
1264,00:38:54.57,00:38:54.57,"Jeff: WELL, IT IS"
1265,00:38:55.73,00:38:55.73,DEFINITELY A RISKY MOVE.
1266,00:38:57.17,00:38:57.17,LET'S SEE IF YOU HAVE THE
1267,00:38:58.57,00:38:58.57,COURAGE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.
1268,00:38:59.73,00:38:59.73,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
1269,00:39:02.47,00:39:02.47,"KEITH, YOU'RE UP."

1272,00:39:17.53,00:39:17.53,AND I'M THRILLED TO BE A PART OF
1273,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,"IT, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS"
1274,00:39:21.20,00:39:21.20,SAVING MY ASS FOR ONE MORE TIME
