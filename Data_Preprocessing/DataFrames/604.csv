1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.50,00:00:01.50,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20," at Tambaqui,  new friendships form."
4,00:00:05.80,00:00:05.80,"DANIEL: Matthew and I  are great friends,"
5,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67, and he's a really good ally.
6,00:00:09.47,00:00:09.47,I can trust him. You can just tell.
7,00:00:10.20,00:00:10.20,PROBST: But not everyone  was getting along.
8,00:00:12.13,00:00:12.13,You can handle it by yourself or not?
9,00:00:13.90,00:00:13.90,Yeah. You're going to go with me or what?
10,00:00:16.10,00:00:16.10,If you... I'll go do it.
11,00:00:17.33,00:00:17.33, It really got me hot.  I was tempted
12,00:00:19.47,00:00:19.47,"to slap the kid around, to be honest with you."
13,00:00:20.97,00:00:20.97,"PROBST:  At Jaburu, the women"
14,00:00:22.17,00:00:22.17, had even bigger problems
15,00:00:23.27,00:00:23.27, getting it together...
16,00:00:24.40,00:00:24.40,JEANNE:  We've been spinning
17,00:00:25.80,00:00:25.80," our wheels, and"
18,00:00:27.13,00:00:27.13,you can't spin your wheels in the jungle.
19,00:00:28.77,00:00:28.77,PROBST: ...until they decided  to elect a leader.
20,00:00:31.03,00:00:31.03,"I, um, initiate Deena."
21,00:00:32.70,00:00:32.70," Strategically,  Joanna and I decided to put"
22,00:00:36.10,00:00:36.10, Deena up for the leadership  position. I think
23,00:00:38.17,00:00:38.17,she's going to create a little friction.
24,00:00:39.87,00:00:39.87,"PROBST:  At the reward challenge,"
25,00:00:41.20,00:00:41.20, the girls won some
26,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60, much-needed bathing supplies.
27,00:00:43.97,00:00:43.97,HEIDI:   The cuter girls kind of
28,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33," went off from the older women,"
29,00:00:47.33,00:00:47.33," because  we've got better bodies,"
30,00:00:48.83,00:00:48.83,"and that's, like, a huge issue with older people."
31,00:00:50.97,00:00:50.97,PROBST: The tribes competed  in a jail break for immunity.
32,00:00:53.83,00:00:53.83,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
33,00:00:55.20,00:00:55.20,-(cheering) -PROBST: Immunity--
34,00:00:56.33,00:00:56.33,Jaburu!
35,00:00:57.87,00:00:57.87, And the seven women of Jaburu
36,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17," escaped their sentence,"
37,00:01:00.63,00:01:00.63, while Tambaqui's numbers  dropped to six
38,00:01:02.40,00:01:02.40, when Daniel was voted  out of the tribe.
39,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,"Daniel, the tribe has spoken."
40,00:01:08.33,00:01:08.33, 13 are left.
41,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83, Who will be voted out tonight?
42,00:02:19.27,00:02:19.27,(metallic scraping)
43,00:02:33.57,00:02:33.57,"JOANNA: Oh, Lordy."
44,00:02:35.77,00:02:35.77,"Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy."
45,00:02:37.77,00:02:37.77,(metal scraping on metal)
46,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23,Another day in the Amazon.
47,00:02:41.83,00:02:41.83,"JEANNE:  Today is day number ten,"
48,00:02:44.93,00:02:44.93," and our goal was,  everyone wake up early"
49,00:02:47.50,00:02:47.50, so we could start getting  some shelter.
50,00:02:49.30,00:02:49.30, Everyone should be
51,00:02:50.97,00:02:50.97,"enthusiastic to work today,"
52,00:02:52.97,00:02:52.97,'cause we really have to get some things done around here.
53,00:02:55.50,00:02:55.50,"Okay, what are we going to do today?"
54,00:02:57.20,00:02:57.20,"We set a goal every day, and we end up accomplishing it, so..."
55,00:03:00.73,00:03:00.73,We should be going fishing
56,00:03:02.67,00:03:02.67,while everybody else collect fire wood.
57,00:03:04.00,00:03:04.00,"When I woke up, on my shift, there was no fire wood,"
58,00:03:06.70,00:03:06.70,and the fire was gone.
59,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,"I say, there's some trifling folk"
60,00:03:10.50,00:03:10.50,who was on that shift before me.
61,00:03:13.33,00:03:13.33,I'll go get enough wood now to...
62,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"JOANNA: Yeah, right. You did that yesterday."
63,00:03:17.70,00:03:17.70,I know. I don't care.
64,00:03:21.87,00:03:21.87,(chopping)
65,00:03:29.13,00:03:29.13,"SHAWNA: Every morning,  I'm woken up by"
66,00:03:32.27,00:03:32.27," two girls shooting me  horrendous looks,"
67,00:03:34.10,00:03:34.10," like, aren't I worthless,"
68,00:03:35.53,00:03:35.53," looking at me still  in bed, and they're just"
69,00:03:37.63,00:03:37.63, constantly trying  to make everyone feel bad
70,00:03:40.40,00:03:40.40, like they're not doing enough.
71,00:03:43.17,00:03:43.17,"It's getting to be a total martyr thing,"
72,00:03:45.93,00:03:45.93,"and it's driving the tribe, especially me, up the wall."
73,00:03:49.17,00:03:49.17,JOANNA: Can we not throw babassu nut
74,00:03:51.37,00:03:51.37,shells around the bed where we have to sleep?
75,00:03:53.80,00:03:53.80,"Can we keep it clean, please?"
76,00:03:55.07,00:03:55.07,This is where our heads are laying at night.
77,00:03:56.83,00:03:56.83,I don't think any of us meant to.
78,00:03:58.57,00:03:58.57,I'm sorry if we ended up there.
79,00:04:00.93,00:04:00.93,"HEIDI: It's always been put  in our heads,"
80,00:04:03.03,00:04:03.03," the harder worker gets ahead,  but this is a game."
81,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40, You have to figure out  what gets you ahead
82,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60," in the game, not what gets you  ahead in life, so,"
83,00:04:10.93,00:04:10.93,"my philosophy about Jeanne and Joanna is,"
84,00:04:13.87,00:04:13.87,"you want to do all this extra work,"
85,00:04:16.03,00:04:16.03,by all means do it.
86,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07," I am going to sit here  and take a breath,"
87,00:04:22.47,00:04:22.47," maybe take a nap today,  and I guarantee"
88,00:04:25.27,00:04:25.27,I'll probably be getting ahead of you in the game.
89,00:04:41.27,00:04:41.27,Belly's starting to rumble.
90,00:04:43.20,00:04:43.20,BUTCH: Need more fish now.
91,00:04:45.30,00:04:45.30,"MATTHEW: Not so much as a nibble, huh?"
92,00:04:48.07,00:04:48.07,Very evasive fish.
93,00:04:49.87,00:04:49.87,"Time to bite, sports fans."
94,00:04:51.93,00:04:51.93,"Yeah, it's time to be a little bit more receptive."
95,00:04:54.43,00:04:54.43,I don't think they fully understand
96,00:04:55.87,00:04:55.87,just how hungry we are.
97,00:04:57.30,00:04:57.30,DAVE:  We really got to step it up.
98,00:04:59.30,00:04:59.30," We're not maximizing  our main food source,"
99,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63, which is this body  of water that we're next to.
100,00:05:04.47,00:05:04.47," Um, pulling in little  rinky-dink minnows is not"
101,00:05:07.60,00:05:07.60,"keeping seven healthy, strong guys alive,"
102,00:05:10.97,00:05:10.97," so we got to get food down,  we got to get it done quick."
103,00:05:13.83,00:05:13.83,There once were three guys in a boat
104,00:05:17.13,00:05:17.13,who left early with spirits afloat.
105,00:05:20.33,00:05:20.33,"Looking for bass, sat on their ass."
106,00:05:24.77,00:05:24.77,Luck as good as Rob's jokes.
107,00:05:28.50,00:05:28.50,(laughter)
108,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,-(insects chirping) -There they are.
109,00:05:31.77,00:05:31.77,Successful mission?
110,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,We didn't want to start a trend.
111,00:05:34.73,00:05:34.73,Okay.
112,00:05:36.07,00:05:36.07,BUTCH: We didn't catch  any fish this morning.
113,00:05:38.03,00:05:38.03,"It's not going along very good, but we're going to keep trying."
114,00:05:40.77,00:05:40.77, So we've come up  with another idea.
115,00:05:42.40,00:05:42.40, We have not used worms.
116,00:05:43.67,00:05:43.67,The reason why we haven't used worms yet is
117,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,because we haven't gone and looked for them.
118,00:05:47.80,00:05:47.80,We're on worm safari.
119,00:05:53.73,00:05:53.73,MATTHEW:  I think that
120,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83, these worms  are most likely everywhere.
121,00:05:58.00,00:05:58.00, There's no reason  to go on a long
122,00:06:00.70,00:06:00.70,expedition and exhaust yourself.
123,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67, But those guys are probably  going collectively
124,00:06:05.03,00:06:05.03," to somewhat exclude me,  which is"
125,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,"likely the case, but that's cool."
126,00:06:09.87,00:06:09.87,My ego can take it.
127,00:06:11.50,00:06:11.50, I think my biggest challenge  to date has been starting off
128,00:06:14.53,00:06:14.53, on the wrong foot  with my friendship
129,00:06:17.40,00:06:17.40," with Ryan and Dan,  and perhaps not"
130,00:06:21.00,00:06:21.00, spending enough time  developing relationships
131,00:06:22.97,00:06:22.97, with other people.
132,00:06:24.43,00:06:24.43," Very often, I'm not included,  and I know it's"
133,00:06:26.53,00:06:26.53,on purpose.
134,00:06:27.90,00:06:27.90,It's intentional.
135,00:06:29.17,00:06:29.17,Oh.
136,00:06:30.87,00:06:30.87, I believe that  the vote would be against me
137,00:06:33.73,00:06:33.73, if there were  a Tribal Council tonight.
138,00:06:36.73,00:06:36.73,"Whoa, here we go."
139,00:06:37.90,00:06:37.90,"-Yeah, you got one? -Got one."
140,00:06:39.30,00:06:39.30,Yeah!
141,00:06:40.47,00:06:40.47,"Small, but it's a... it's a worm."
142,00:06:42.10,00:06:42.10,"Yeah, it's a worm."
143,00:06:43.27,00:06:43.27,"Ah, look at this guy."
144,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,Whoa! He's feisty.
145,00:06:45.80,00:06:45.80,"Yeah, that's a worm."
146,00:06:48.80,00:06:48.80,-What the hell is that? -Oh.
147,00:06:51.00,00:06:51.00,-Oh! -Scorpion.
148,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,Baby scorpion! Ew!
149,00:06:54.00,00:06:54.00,"DAVE: We started digging for  worms and, yeah, struck gold."
150,00:06:57.00,00:06:57.00," So, I think we'll certainly be  able to go in and catch all"
151,00:07:00.23,00:07:00.23," the more three-to-five-inch,"
152,00:07:01.97,00:07:01.97,"yeah, little minnows out here, and hopefully, a bass or two."
153,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70,"Well, there's a success for the start of the day."
154,00:07:06.80,00:07:06.80,"ROGER: Yeah, that's good."
155,00:07:20.50,00:07:20.50,JOANNA: When I went back
156,00:07:22.77,00:07:22.77,"to the thing, there was another little fish caught on my..."
157,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,caught on the... thing.
158,00:07:26.23,00:07:26.23,There was another little fish?
159,00:07:27.40,00:07:27.40,Caught on the thing when I went
160,00:07:28.80,00:07:28.80,to go get the line out the water.
161,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,JEANNE: Yeah. Throw it right in.
162,00:07:33.87,00:07:33.87,-I think that's another... -We have stew.
163,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,...two more bitefuls.
164,00:07:36.50,00:07:36.50,"-(Joanna laughs) -Oh, good catch."
165,00:07:37.77,00:07:37.77,-Yup. -Yeah.
166,00:07:40.87,00:07:40.87,-We have food. -I know.
167,00:07:42.23,00:07:42.23,"-That's a good thing. -Yeah, we have nourishment."
168,00:07:43.83,00:07:43.83,HEIDI:  The work ethic in our camp
169,00:07:45.47,00:07:45.47, is definitely  creating friction.
170,00:07:46.87,00:07:46.87, You've got
171,00:07:48.63,00:07:48.63,bigger women that have more fat  to live on
172,00:07:50.77,00:07:50.77," that, obviously,  can put out more effort,"
173,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53, as far as manual work.
174,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,And then you've got the-the smaller girls
175,00:07:56.13,00:07:56.13,"that are like the stay-at-home women, okay?"
176,00:07:59.07,00:07:59.07,We were just all sitting over here
177,00:08:00.97,00:08:00.97,chatting on ways we deal with not...
178,00:08:02.90,00:08:02.90,"with being here, as opposed to being in our comfort zone."
179,00:08:06.20,00:08:06.20,"My mother always tell me, ""This, too, shall pass."""
180,00:08:08.37,00:08:08.37,HEIDI: Yeah.
181,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,It's not the first hard thing I had to do.
182,00:08:12.13,00:08:12.13,"There's always sweet rewards,"
183,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63,and-and that anything worth having
184,00:08:15.13,00:08:15.13,is worth working hard for.
185,00:08:16.60,00:08:16.60,You can't just expect stuff to come drop in your lap.
186,00:08:19.70,00:08:19.70,HEIDI: No. No...
187,00:08:20.93,00:08:20.93,"JOANNA: I mean, beauty is deceitful,"
188,00:08:22.37,00:08:22.37,"and favor is vain, but a woman that fears the Lord"
189,00:08:26.20,00:08:26.20,shall be praised.
190,00:08:27.37,00:08:27.37,(insects buzzing)
191,00:08:28.53,00:08:28.53,"Because people may give you favor,"
192,00:08:30.00,00:08:30.00,"or pretend they're your friends, whatever,"
193,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,"for their own purpose and their own gain,"
194,00:08:33.47,00:08:33.47,"and beauty will fade with time,"
195,00:08:34.93,00:08:34.93,but only your virtue
196,00:08:37.37,00:08:37.37,and your character is what's going to last.
197,00:08:39.50,00:08:39.50,HEIDI:  I'm really not sure how
198,00:08:41.90,00:08:41.90," that quote fit in  with anything, except maybe"
199,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,she was just trying to pick on the fact
200,00:08:47.30,00:08:47.30,"that we were cute girls,"
201,00:08:48.97,00:08:48.97,and we're worrying about stuff that she's not worrying about?
202,00:08:50.83,00:08:50.83,"This, too, shall pass."
203,00:08:52.50,00:08:52.50,I've been keeping that in the back of my mind.
204,00:08:54.93,00:08:54.93,JENNA:  Don't be mad because
205,00:08:57.57,00:08:57.57,we have good bodies.
206,00:08:58.83,00:08:58.83,It's not our fault. Get over it.
207,00:09:00.43,00:09:00.43,(laughs)
208,00:09:01.93,00:09:01.93, Me and Heidi are definitely  the skinnier of the group.
209,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,(laughs)
210,00:09:06.33,00:09:06.33,"And better-looking, but I think  it's definitely a liability."
211,00:09:09.57,00:09:09.57, I think that's what  we were both worried about.
212,00:09:11.53,00:09:11.53," We wanted to be on a tribe  with some men,"
213,00:09:14.07,00:09:14.07, because with women--  they can just be
214,00:09:15.93,00:09:15.93,pissed that we have good bodies and look okay
215,00:09:18.67,00:09:18.67,and just vote us off as easy as that.
216,00:09:25.00,00:09:25.00,(insects chirping)
217,00:09:33.27,00:09:33.27,"HEIDI:  From the very beginning,"
218,00:09:34.73,00:09:34.73, I knew that I either wanted  to team up
219,00:09:36.83,00:09:36.83," with Shawna or Jenna,  because what happens when"
220,00:09:40.27,00:09:40.27," you're a cute little girl,"
221,00:09:41.67,00:09:41.67, it's very easy  to be ganged up on.
222,00:09:43.57,00:09:43.57," So I thought, you know what?"
223,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10,If you have all the little girls
224,00:09:46.80,00:09:46.80,"against more of the bigger girls, that it's like,"
225,00:09:48.97,00:09:48.97,at least we have three against somebody else.
226,00:09:50.93,00:09:50.93,"I feel really bad, though, that we're, like, getting..."
227,00:09:53.07,00:09:53.07,"You know, they're, like,"
228,00:09:54.30,00:09:54.30,"working their tail off, and we're, like..."
229,00:09:56.27,00:09:56.27,"HEIDI: This is a game, though. I mean, you've got"
230,00:09:57.97,00:09:57.97,"to play out the roles. You've got to say,"
231,00:09:59.53,00:09:59.53,"""Okay, this is my next opponent's move."
232,00:10:01.03,00:10:01.03,"-This is how I'm going to react."" -It's like chess."
233,00:10:03.40,00:10:03.40,"And if you can't do that, then you really don't deserve to win."
234,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,"I agree, I agree."
235,00:10:06.97,00:10:06.97,"You have to be a smart player, so..."
236,00:10:08.60,00:10:08.60,"SHAWNA:  The older women might, uh,"
237,00:10:11.00,00:10:11.00," try to kind of mount an  offensive against us,"
238,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47, trying to weed out the meek  or prissy or whatever.
239,00:10:17.90,00:10:17.90," So I figured,"
240,00:10:19.53,00:10:19.53,"with my closeness to Deena,"
241,00:10:20.70,00:10:20.70,"that if we could swing Deena's vote,"
242,00:10:22.47,00:10:22.47,"then it was, you know, game on,"
243,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,that we could totally hold our weight.
244,00:10:25.80,00:10:25.80,"And if I rely on you, and you guys rely on me,"
245,00:10:28.17,00:10:28.17,and I will not break my word.
246,00:10:29.53,00:10:29.53,-I just need to know. -Yes.
247,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,DEENA: We're cleared.
248,00:10:33.83,00:10:33.83," The other girls  and I talked very briefly,"
249,00:10:35.77,00:10:35.77, and it just seemed
250,00:10:37.00,00:10:37.00, natural to me  that that would be
251,00:10:39.17,00:10:39.17, a great alliance.  We need four.
252,00:10:41.43,00:10:41.43, I have nothing  in common with them.
253,00:10:44.43,00:10:44.43,I'm married with two children.
254,00:10:45.93,00:10:45.93,"These people are in their 20s, young, fit, and good-looking."
255,00:10:50.80,00:10:50.80,Let's go.
256,00:10:52.43,00:10:52.43,DEENA: I chose to ally myself  with the younger women
257,00:10:55.20,00:10:55.20, because I think that I'm able  to talk and persuade
258,00:10:58.57,00:10:58.57," the younger crowd more  than I would, say, an older,"
259,00:11:01.53,00:11:01.53," established,  been-around-the-block crowd."
260,00:11:04.13,00:11:04.13,"Yeah, to scoop the fish out with."
261,00:11:05.97,00:11:05.97,It looks good. So flaky.
262,00:11:08.10,00:11:08.10,"SHAWNA: If our alliance  sticks together,"
263,00:11:10.43,00:11:10.43, Joanna and Jeannie--  they're in big trouble.
264,00:11:13.23,00:11:13.23," I don't know  what their plan is, but"
265,00:11:15.07,00:11:15.07,"right now, all of us are too determined."
266,00:11:18.17,00:11:18.17,"Even if we disliked each other,  we'd still"
267,00:11:20.13,00:11:20.13, stick by the alliance 'cause
268,00:11:21.67,00:11:21.67,"that's the strategy of it, you know?"
269,00:11:41.87,00:11:41.87,(screeches)
270,00:11:52.87,00:11:52.87,MATTHEW:  Fishing is my forte.
271,00:11:55.03,00:11:55.03, I love fishing.
272,00:11:56.60,00:11:56.60, I've been fishing ever since  I was a little kid.
273,00:11:57.67,00:11:57.67,"Dude, I got a big fish. Take this."
274,00:11:59.90,00:11:59.90,"DAVE: Yeah, you do."
275,00:12:01.97,00:12:01.97,MATTHEW: I know that no one  can challenge my contributions
276,00:12:05.97,00:12:05.97, to life here at the camp.
277,00:12:08.73,00:12:08.73,DAVE: It's food time for Tam-ba-shmi.
278,00:12:10.77,00:12:10.77,First thing we're going to do...
279,00:12:12.33,00:12:12.33,Kill him.
280,00:12:13.63,00:12:13.63,Get the hook out of this baby. Yeah.
281,00:12:16.63,00:12:16.63,Okay.
282,00:12:17.80,00:12:17.80,-Nicely done. -Nice!
283,00:12:19.13,00:12:19.13,"-Hey, nice! -Bon appetit, man."
284,00:12:20.80,00:12:20.80,"Badonks, baby. Well done!"
285,00:12:22.40,00:12:22.40,"Hell, yeah!"
286,00:12:23.80,00:12:23.80,"This is a peacock bass, dude. I read about them before."
287,00:12:26.40,00:12:26.40, I'm genuinely reaching out  to various individuals.
288,00:12:30.47,00:12:30.47,"Well done, Matteo."
289,00:12:31.83,00:12:31.83,MATTHEW:   While I was certainly
290,00:12:34.13,00:12:34.13," friendly with Ryan and Dan,  I am an individual."
291,00:12:37.77,00:12:37.77,Go do it. Go do it. We're hanging here.
292,00:12:39.90,00:12:39.90,MATTHEW:  I think my actions
293,00:12:41.23,00:12:41.23, to turn things around  have begun to show
294,00:12:43.10,00:12:43.10,"some, um..."
295,00:12:45.80,00:12:45.80,"some fruit, if I could say that."
296,00:12:48.60,00:12:48.60,"Hey, guys, I've got good news and bad news."
297,00:12:52.90,00:12:52.90,Bad news is I'm going to smell like fish for a while.
298,00:12:56.57,00:12:56.57,"Good news is, I finally caught one."
299,00:12:58.67,00:12:58.67,All right!
300,00:13:00.33,00:13:00.33,-Is that cool or what? -That is a fish!
301,00:13:02.67,00:13:02.67,"What do you think, guys? Come on, man."
302,00:13:04.77,00:13:04.77,(laughing): All right! Yeah!
303,00:13:07.00,00:13:07.00,ALEX: The tribe is feeling  really good. We caught our
304,00:13:09.33,00:13:09.33, -first real fish.  -This is a beautiful fish.
305,00:13:10.87,00:13:10.87,ALEX:  We feel like we got a
306,00:13:12.40,00:13:12.40,"strong team now, a cohesive group"
307,00:13:13.67,00:13:13.67,that-that can actually work
308,00:13:15.13,00:13:15.13," together, and we really need  to carry"
309,00:13:16.90,00:13:16.90, our momentum  to a reward challenge.
310,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23,"-It's a big day, man. -This is a big day."
311,00:13:20.97,00:13:20.97,-We're gonna keep right on rolling. -Yup.
312,00:13:37.13,00:13:37.13,"All right, if there's one thing"
313,00:13:38.77,00:13:38.77,"that I think probably everybody here understands,"
314,00:13:40.70,00:13:40.70,it is the value of fire.
315,00:13:43.23,00:13:43.23,The ability to make fire
316,00:13:44.87,00:13:44.87,"and keep fire-- you need it to boil water, to cook food."
317,00:13:48.57,00:13:48.57,"Today's challenge, very simple."
318,00:13:49.97,00:13:49.97,Going to test your ability to make fire.
319,00:13:52.67,00:13:52.67,Here's the challenge.
320,00:13:54.63,00:13:54.63,There are four ropes. Each rope is attached
321,00:13:56.70,00:13:56.70,to a section of your banner.
322,00:13:58.57,00:13:58.57,"You will each be given flint and steel,"
323,00:14:01.63,00:14:01.63,you'll have a magnifying glass.
324,00:14:02.93,00:14:02.93,"Your goal-- working one rope at a time,"
325,00:14:06.20,00:14:06.20,"build a fire big enough to burn the rope,"
326,00:14:09.13,00:14:09.13,releasing a section of your banner.
327,00:14:10.57,00:14:10.57,"First tribe to burn through all four ropes,"
328,00:14:13.63,00:14:13.63,"revealing their tribe name, wins reward."
329,00:14:16.30,00:14:16.30,-Want to know what you're playing for? -Yes. -Yeah.
330,00:14:19.43,00:14:19.43,Fully-functioning refrigerator
331,00:14:21.77,00:14:21.77,"will become a part of your camp, and it is"
332,00:14:24.90,00:14:24.90,stocked... with Coke.
333,00:14:28.03,00:14:28.03,-(whooping) -You've even got some Vanilla Coke
334,00:14:30.47,00:14:30.47,"back there, you got some Cherry Coke back there."
335,00:14:33.27,00:14:33.27,"Definitely worth playing for, right?"
336,00:14:34.43,00:14:34.43,"-Yeah. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
337,00:14:35.93,00:14:35.93,Take your positions. Wait for my go.
338,00:14:39.27,00:14:39.27,"All right, Jaburu,"
339,00:14:40.97,00:14:40.97,"because you have one extra member, sitting somebody out."
340,00:14:42.90,00:14:42.90,"It's gonna be you, Jenna?"
341,00:14:44.37,00:14:44.37,Have a seat on the bench next to the ice-cold refrigerator.
342,00:14:46.87,00:14:46.87,"For a great reward, Survivors, ready?"
343,00:14:50.80,00:14:50.80,Go!
344,00:14:52.80,00:14:52.80,"BUTCH: Somebody get the pot. You getting that, Roger?"
345,00:14:54.93,00:14:54.93,I am. I'm getting it. Don't worry about that.
346,00:15:07.27,00:15:07.27,"Look at this, boys. Look at this, boys. Look at this."
347,00:15:08.87,00:15:08.87,Look at this. Don't need shavings.
348,00:15:10.43,00:15:10.43,Look at the shavings I got. Look at the shavings I got.
349,00:15:12.07,00:15:12.07,"-(indistinct chatter) -Oh, here, here."
350,00:15:13.27,00:15:13.27,Here's shavings.
351,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,JOANNA: I can't. These-These logs are unstable.
352,00:15:19.83,00:15:19.83,And too many people are on there shaking it.
353,00:15:28.70,00:15:28.70,"I'm not getting anything out of this magnifying glass, guys."
354,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,I got it. I got it.
355,00:15:33.67,00:15:33.67,"-Come on, somebody help me. -Okay."
356,00:15:35.13,00:15:35.13,-Put some stuff on it. -(indistinct chatter)
357,00:15:36.93,00:15:36.93,Please put this-this fuzzy stuff on it. The fuzzy stuff...
358,00:15:39.20,00:15:39.20,Not fuzzy stuff...
359,00:15:40.97,00:15:40.97,Jaburu has first fire.
360,00:15:42.00,00:15:42.00,"Thank you, Lord."
361,00:15:43.40,00:15:43.40,You're so good to me.
362,00:15:48.83,00:15:48.83,The wind's going to move it around a lot.
363,00:15:51.00,00:15:51.00,"-Yeah, we... -PROBST: Think about"
364,00:15:52.80,00:15:52.80,how to block that wind.
365,00:15:54.37,00:15:54.37,Come on. We got something right here. Get it in.
366,00:15:56.37,00:15:56.37,-Get it in here. -Tambaqui got something going.
367,00:15:57.70,00:15:57.70,"-No, no, no, no, no, no, no! -Get it up."
368,00:15:59.67,00:15:59.67,PROBST: Tambaqui has first fire.
369,00:16:01.03,00:16:01.03,"There you go, and then, put it inside this little guy."
370,00:16:04.40,00:16:04.40,"-Come on, baby. -Light."
371,00:16:06.07,00:16:06.07,Jaburu getting close on their first rope.
372,00:16:11.17,00:16:11.17,-(shouting) -Jaburu has their first section completed.
373,00:16:15.17,00:16:15.17,Move as much of that fire as you can.
374,00:16:17.17,00:16:17.17,-I've got some big ones. -Stoke it up.
375,00:16:18.77,00:16:18.77,-(overlapping chatter) -Here's the fuzzy stuff.
376,00:16:20.37,00:16:20.37,Keep the shavings off.
377,00:16:22.37,00:16:22.37,"Good job, guys. Good job."
378,00:16:23.73,00:16:23.73,Careful. Take some of the big ones off when
379,00:16:25.33,00:16:25.33,-you're transporting them over. -Don't let it get poked.
380,00:16:27.20,00:16:27.20,I need shavings. I need shavings.
381,00:16:28.63,00:16:28.63,Don't let it touch the rope.
382,00:16:30.53,00:16:30.53,(indistinct chatter)
383,00:16:35.00,00:16:35.00,PROBST: Wind playing a big part in this.
384,00:16:37.70,00:16:37.70,"All right, block the wind. Stand there."
385,00:16:40.30,00:16:40.30,"-Block the wind, guys. -Come on."
386,00:16:42.33,00:16:42.33,PROBST: Tambaqui trying to block the wind.
387,00:16:44.73,00:16:44.73,Jaburu trying to block the wind.
388,00:16:46.93,00:16:46.93,Okay.
389,00:16:49.70,00:16:49.70,Jaburu has section two down.
390,00:16:51.53,00:16:51.53,Somebody help me carry this.
391,00:16:53.87,00:16:53.87,"Come on, baby. It's there, it's there. It's almost there."
392,00:16:56.50,00:16:56.50,(indistinct chatter)

396,00:17:10.60,00:17:10.60,That wind is... The wind is coming down here.
397,00:17:13.30,00:17:13.30,Right in here. Here it is. Here it is.
398,00:17:14.87,00:17:14.87,"-Hairs on my leg, man. -That's okay."

400,00:17:18.63,00:17:18.63,"Hey, I'm burning up, but don't worry about it."
401,00:17:20.23,00:17:20.23,"Baptism by fire, guys."

598,00:24:59.80,00:24:59.80,\xe2\x99\xaa You lost that loving feeling \xe2\x99\xaa
599,00:25:05.67,00:25:05.67,"\xe2\x99\xaa Whoa, that loving feeling \xe2\x99\xaa"
600,00:25:09.90,00:25:09.90,BUTCH: Would I like to have  women around right now?
601,00:25:12.07,00:25:12.07, I think the answer  to that is that
602,00:25:13.37,00:25:13.37, I'm-I'm enjoying  the company right now.
603,00:25:14.97,00:25:14.97," I'm a lot more comfortable,  and we will continue to be"
604,00:25:17.40,00:25:17.40,a lot more comfortable with the women over there
605,00:25:19.13,00:25:19.13,and-and the guys here.
606,00:25:20.13,00:25:20.13,\xe2\x99\xaa You lost that loving feeling \xe2\x99\xaa

610,00:25:34.93,00:25:34.93,Not bad. That was not bad.
611,00:25:36.50,00:25:36.50,-Very good. -Well done. -(applause)
612,00:25:37.83,00:25:37.83," But I have to be honest,  he really is pathetic."

615,00:25:45.07,00:25:45.07,"DAVE: Man, that's hard to follow up right there."
616,00:26:09.10,00:26:09.10,"Oh, look at that, a piranha."
617,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23,"Oh, wow."
618,00:26:11.23,00:26:11.23,That is some nasty-looking stuff.
619,00:26:12.73,00:26:12.73,Wow.

621,00:26:20.13,00:26:20.13,Rise and shine.
622,00:26:23.20,00:26:23.20,You guys want to stay in bed while we read it?
623,00:26:26.13,00:26:26.13,-Yeah. -Thank you.

630,00:26:45.03,00:26:45.03,-Crazy. -(makes chewing noises)
631,00:27:02.03,00:27:02.03,PROBST: Nice and tight right in here.
632,00:27:09.20,00:27:09.20,Welcome.
633,00:27:11.20,00:27:11.20,Come on out and have a spot on your mat.
634,00:27:21.10,00:27:21.10,First things first.
635,00:27:22.10,00:27:22.10,"Shawna, gotta take it back."
636,00:27:24.13,00:27:24.13,Immunity back up for grabs.
637,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,All right.
638,00:27:27.33,00:27:27.33,"At our reward challenge, we tested your ability"
639,00:27:30.27,00:27:30.27,"to make fire-- one of the key elements, right, for survival."
640,00:27:33.50,00:27:33.50,"Today, we're gonna test another element of survival:"
641,00:27:36.53,00:27:36.53,your ability to catch fish.
642,00:27:38.37,00:27:38.37,Each tribe's gonna have one hour
643,00:27:40.43,00:27:40.43,to catch as many fish as they can.
644,00:27:42.20,00:27:42.20,Here's your toolkit.
645,00:27:43.23,00:27:43.23,"You'll each have a pole,"
646,00:27:44.23,00:27:44.23,"plenty of bait,"
647,00:27:46.50,00:27:46.50,"have a knife, pliers and hooks."
648,00:27:50.37,00:27:50.37,"Now, there are a lot of fish out there, but the most common"
649,00:27:53.73,00:27:53.73,and the most likely to bite you is the piranha.
650,00:27:58.63,00:27:58.63,This is a small piranha.
651,00:28:00.07,00:28:00.07,"They have a sharp bite,"
652,00:28:01.40,00:28:01.40,"and when they start biting, it's very vicious."
653,00:28:03.97,00:28:03.97,This is another piranha we caught this morning.
654,00:28:06.40,00:28:06.40,A little larger. You can see the teeth.
655,00:28:08.63,00:28:08.63,"These guys will take your finger off, no question about it."
656,00:28:11.80,00:28:11.80,I just want you guys to not get careless.
657,00:28:14.37,00:28:14.37,Okay.
658,00:28:15.87,00:28:15.87,"So, each tribe will have an hour."
659,00:28:17.53,00:28:17.53,"We picked two spots 50 yards apart, where"
660,00:28:20.10,00:28:20.10, there are highly-concentrated  amounts of piranha.
661,00:28:23.37,00:28:23.37,"At the end of one hour, whoever has the most fish by weight"
662,00:28:28.13,00:28:28.13,wins immunity and wins all the fish they caught.
663,00:28:31.37,00:28:31.37,"(murmuring, cheering)"
664,00:28:34.10,00:28:34.10,"Jaburu, since you have one extra member,"
665,00:28:36.20,00:28:36.20,you've chosen Shawna to sit out.
666,00:28:38.37,00:28:38.37,"Get your toolkits together, get in your boat."
667,00:28:40.40,00:28:40.40,We'll head out.
668,00:28:44.23,00:28:44.23,"Here we go, guys, for immunity."
669,00:28:46.50,00:28:46.50,Survivors ready?
670,00:28:47.47,00:28:47.47,-Yeah. -Yeah.
671,00:28:49.27,00:28:49.27,Go!
672,00:28:55.80,00:28:55.80,Tambaqui off to a good start.
673,00:28:58.43,00:28:58.43,"Hey, I caught a fish."
674,00:28:59.87,00:28:59.87,(chuckles): Hey.
675,00:29:00.93,00:29:00.93,"Guys, help; it's a piranha."
676,00:29:01.93,00:29:01.93,PROBST: Jaburu has their first fish.
677,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,I'm just going to step on it while someone gets it.
678,00:29:07.13,00:29:07.13,"Yeah, this one, too."
679,00:29:09.10,00:29:09.10,We need the pliers.
680,00:29:15.43,00:29:15.43,DAVE: Got one.
681,00:29:16.57,00:29:16.57,Do you jerk it hard?
682,00:29:17.83,00:29:17.83,"Yeah, pull it straight up."
683,00:29:19.07,00:29:19.07,"Guys, first, uh, nibble, you just got to grab it."
684,00:29:21.40,00:29:21.40,"That's it, baby doll. See how I did that?"
685,00:29:22.90,00:29:22.90,He started to run with it.
686,00:29:23.90,00:29:23.90,Good job.
687,00:29:26.67,00:29:26.67,"Small, but it counts."
688,00:29:27.87,00:29:27.87,"Hey, it's weight, boys."
689,00:29:29.03,00:29:29.03,"Hey, can you give me a hand here?"
690,00:29:30.37,00:29:30.37,-I can't get this hook out. -Yeah.
691,00:29:38.73,00:29:38.73,"PROBST: Heidi, tell me about your strategy."
692,00:29:40.07,00:29:40.07,What's the best way to catch a piranha?
693,00:29:42.83,00:29:42.83,Cutting up other little piranha and trying to go off
694,00:29:46.13,00:29:46.13,"the end of the boat where it's deeper,"
695,00:29:47.70,00:29:47.70,"and hopefully, we'll get some bigger ones."
696,00:29:49.17,00:29:49.17,PROBST: So you're risking a little weight
697,00:29:50.83,00:29:50.83,in hope of catching something bigger.
698,00:29:52.37,00:29:52.37,"-How's it going, Joanna? -It's going."
699,00:29:54.60,00:29:54.60,It's just little fish and trying to catch a bigger one.
700,00:29:56.80,00:29:56.80,"You're at 30 minutes, guys."
701,00:29:58.60,00:29:58.60,"You see, Jeff, I think the big thing that we need"
702,00:30:00.33,00:30:00.33,to talk about is the dynamic combination of Roger and myself.
703,00:30:04.43,00:30:04.43,"What is exactly that combination, rocket scientist?"
704,00:30:07.10,00:30:07.10,"In terms of rocket science, as soon as, uh, Roger"
705,00:30:11.17,00:30:11.17,"gets the, uh, the fish in the boat, I apply a large force"
706,00:30:15.23,00:30:15.23,with the bottom of my heel.
707,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,"We switch poles, I take off, rebait,"
708,00:30:18.93,00:30:18.93,"pass it back to Roger, and away we go again."
709,00:30:20.93,00:30:20.93,Do you think there's any chance
710,00:30:22.03,00:30:22.03,Jaburu is outfishing you right now?
711,00:30:23.83,00:30:23.83,-There's always that chance. -There's always that chance.
712,00:30:25.77,00:30:25.77,You take nothing for granted out here.
713,00:30:30.07,00:30:30.07,If someone doesn't-- Whoa!
714,00:30:32.83,00:30:32.83,"No, no!"
715,00:30:33.97,00:30:33.97,"Oh, damn you!"
716,00:30:35.43,00:30:35.43,"These are some little, nasty, little fish."
717,00:30:41.53,00:30:41.53,"Catch it, catch it."
718,00:30:44.07,00:30:44.07,Two minutes remaining!
719,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,Looks like Jaburu may have caught up.
720,00:30:50.10,00:30:50.10,"Oh, yeah."
721,00:30:52.17,00:30:52.17,"How you doing, Matteo?"
722,00:30:53.73,00:30:53.73,"Doing well, man."
723,00:30:54.93,00:30:54.93,There we go.
724,00:30:56.77,00:30:56.77,"Good job, dude."
725,00:30:57.87,00:30:57.87,"I got one, baby."
726,00:31:00.07,00:31:00.07,It's in the boat. It's in the boat.
727,00:31:02.07,00:31:02.07,PROBST: One minute left!
728,00:31:07.33,00:31:07.33,Oh.
729,00:31:08.83,00:31:08.83,Son of a biscuit.
730,00:31:10.40,00:31:10.40,PROBST: 30 seconds!
731,00:31:11.70,00:31:11.70,30 seconds.

733,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07,Nice.
734,00:31:16.63,00:31:16.63,"Oh, yeah."
735,00:31:17.77,00:31:17.77,Give it to me.
736,00:31:19.20,00:31:19.20,"PROBST: Five, four..."
737,00:31:21.23,00:31:21.23,"-Get 'em in there, guys. -Done. -...three, two, one."

739,00:31:26.00,00:31:26.00,All poles out of the water.
740,00:31:27.30,00:31:27.30,No more fishing.
741,00:31:28.57,00:31:28.57,Put it in your bucket and head back to the dock.
742,00:31:36.63,00:31:36.63,Okay.
743,00:31:37.77,00:31:37.77,"The tribe who's caught the most fish,"
744,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,"you're heading back to camp, probably have a nice barbecue."
745,00:31:42.47,00:31:42.47,"For the losing tribe, you're heading to Tribal Council,"
746,00:31:44.90,00:31:44.90,where another person will be voted out of the Amazon.
747,00:31:47.30,00:31:47.30,"Jaburu, bring up your fish,"
748,00:31:49.13,00:31:49.13,put 'em on your side of the scale.
749,00:31:50.93,00:31:50.93,(thunder rumbling)
750,00:31:59.77,00:31:59.77,Tambaqui.
751,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,For immunity and all the fish you caught.
752,00:32:17.57,00:32:17.57,"Tambaqui, congratulations."
753,00:32:19.47,00:32:19.47,Yeah!

755,00:32:23.13,00:32:23.13,DAVE: Well done.
756,00:32:24.20,00:32:24.20,Safe in the Amazon three more days.
757,00:32:25.70,00:32:25.70,You got a lot of fish and hopefully some Coke still left.
758,00:32:27.83,00:32:27.83,Should be a nice afternoon.
759,00:32:28.87,00:32:28.87,"Sadly, Jaburu, not as fun for you."
760,00:32:31.57,00:32:31.57,I'll see you guys at Tribal Council.
761,00:32:32.97,00:32:32.97,Somebody else is going home.
762,00:32:34.67,00:32:34.67,You can head back to camp.
763,00:33:00.07,00:33:00.07,"Oh, I smell like garbage."
764,00:33:01.93,00:33:01.93,(quiet chatter)
765,00:33:04.27,00:33:04.27,Now you're getting into bed?
766,00:33:05.93,00:33:05.93,(Shawna moans)
767,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,You all right?
768,00:33:10.10,00:33:10.10,Mm-hmm. I'm fine.
769,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,Just got lightheaded.
770,00:33:13.73,00:33:13.73,"SHAWNA:  Going to Tribal Council,"
771,00:33:15.80,00:33:15.80, I pretty much  could go either way.
772,00:33:17.77,00:33:17.77, I just feel relieved
773,00:33:19.47,00:33:19.47,that it could be me.
774,00:33:20.47,00:33:20.47,I know that sounds so terrible.
775,00:33:22.10,00:33:22.10,I'm sure I'm probably the first Survivor to say that.
776,00:33:29.03,00:33:29.03,JEANNE:  I will be voting off Shawna.
777,00:33:32.97,00:33:32.97," She's been weak, and, uh,"
778,00:33:34.33,00:33:34.33, we need all the strength  we can get.
779,00:33:36.83,00:33:36.83,"It's going to be sad to see her go,"
780,00:33:38.47,00:33:38.47,but she really needs to get her health back.
781,00:33:45.80,00:33:45.80,SHAWNA: I think Jeanne  and Joanna are voting for me.
782,00:33:49.27,00:33:49.27," I know Christy was thinking  about voting for me, also."
783,00:33:52.73,00:33:52.73, I'm on the fence  about who I'm voting for.
784,00:33:54.93,00:33:54.93, And I feel like  I've kind of been
785,00:33:56.43,00:33:56.43, bumped from the alliance  at this point.
786,00:33:58.13,00:33:58.13," I don't make many decisions  with them anymore, so..."
787,00:34:01.33,00:34:01.33,I may make one on my own.
788,00:34:08.57,00:34:08.57,DEENA: I... I feel a tremendous amount
789,00:34:11.10,00:34:11.10," of compassion for her, I do."
790,00:34:12.97,00:34:12.97,"I feel really bad, but at the same time,"
791,00:34:14.40,00:34:14.40,you have an agreement.
792,00:34:15.40,00:34:15.40,"Don't be a crying, whiny baby."
793,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,Yeah.
794,00:34:18.13,00:34:18.13,"-So, you know... -But she's--"
795,00:34:19.97,00:34:19.97,there's a possibility of screwing us because...
796,00:34:21.67,00:34:21.67,And I don't want to get screwed to help her out.
797,00:34:23.57,00:34:23.57,"No, I don't."
798,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,DEENA: I'm not going to feel  really good inside
799,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17," about keeping Shawna on,"
800,00:34:28.97,00:34:28.97,"but it's kind of a ""Hey, guess what?"
801,00:34:31.53,00:34:31.53,"""You're not in charge here."
802,00:34:32.97,00:34:32.97," ""It's about the core alliance."
803,00:34:35.23,00:34:35.23," And suck it up, baby, 'cause  you're along for the ride."""
804,00:34:38.40,00:34:38.40, Joanna is clearly  the most physical person
805,00:34:41.23,00:34:41.23, that we have on this team.
806,00:34:42.67,00:34:42.67," She has too much power,  too much force."
807,00:34:44.40,00:34:44.40,I need to get her off early.
808,00:34:46.30,00:34:46.30,We could have had the five before-- us four and Christy.
809,00:34:49.13,00:34:49.13,-Right. -And that would have been a for-sure thing.
810,00:34:50.97,00:34:50.97,"JENNA: And the thing is, is once you break down mentally--"
811,00:34:52.70,00:34:52.70,you're to the point where you tell yourself
812,00:34:54.07,00:34:54.07,you're through and you've had it--
813,00:34:55.70,00:34:55.70,then everything else goes kaput.
814,00:34:57.23,00:34:57.23,"I mean, she's falling down when she gets up all of a sudden."
815,00:34:59.73,00:34:59.73,DEENA: How do you feel?
816,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40,-About the situation? -Yes.
817,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,It's a bummer that she feels that way.
818,00:35:05.87,00:35:05.87,JENNA: Christy is kind of like our-our wild card.
819,00:35:09.27,00:35:09.27, It's important for me  and Deena and Heidi
820,00:35:11.70,00:35:11.70, to get Christy  to vote on our side
821,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"because Shawna wants out, and if we let her out now,"
822,00:35:16.37,00:35:16.37,there's a possibility of... of us
823,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67, not being able  to have the majority.
824,00:35:20.73,00:35:20.73,"I know how I feel, and if Shawna wants to go first,"
825,00:35:24.23,00:35:24.23,are we putting her first before Joanna?
826,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,-No. -No.
827,00:35:26.97,00:35:26.97,You're going to put Joanna first?
828,00:35:27.97,00:35:27.97,DEENA: Yes.
829,00:35:29.37,00:35:29.37,So she's not here.
830,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,HEIDI: Bye. Bye.
831,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,So basically she is chopped.
832,00:35:33.47,00:35:33.47,"By doing that, you're securing your position as well."
833,00:35:36.53,00:35:36.53,CHRISTY: I am like  a little free bird over here.
834,00:35:40.47,00:35:40.47,They want me to keep Shawna in the game and we take out Joanna
835,00:35:44.20,00:35:44.20, because she gets on  everybody's nerves.
836,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33," Joanna, however,"
837,00:35:47.37,00:35:47.37,"does get the big, monstrous fish"
838,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,and feeds us and really works and does her job.
839,00:35:53.10,00:35:53.10,But...
840,00:35:54.60,00:35:54.60," at the same time, Shawna--  she really wants to get out."
841,00:35:58.37,00:35:58.37,And it's just like we're making her trapped.
842,00:36:02.67,00:36:02.67,"So it's just, it's..."
843,00:36:04.63,00:36:04.63,I don't know.
844,00:36:57.23,00:36:57.23,Welcome back to Tribal Council.
845,00:36:59.23,00:36:59.23,"Not a place you want to be, I know."
846,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,Tough last three days for you guys.
847,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,"A long winning streak, really,"
848,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13,"and then two challenges in a row,"
849,00:37:07.13,00:37:07.13,"both based on survival, both losses."
850,00:37:09.47,00:37:09.47,"Heidi, what was the reaction of the group?"
851,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,I think we were actually all pretty surprised.
852,00:37:13.87,00:37:13.87,"I mean, we feel like we've got our act together, and..."
853,00:37:16.37,00:37:16.37,"we felt like the reward challenge was a loss,"
854,00:37:19.47,00:37:19.47,"but we were so ready to come in and kick some butt,"
855,00:37:21.90,00:37:21.90,"so, I mean, we really were surprised that we lost."
856,00:37:25.30,00:37:25.30,"PROBST: Last time you guys were here,"
857,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,"you were all in agreement, you needed a leader."
858,00:37:29.10,00:37:29.10,What happened on the leadership front?
859,00:37:30.57,00:37:30.57,"We just threw out ideas of what needs to go on,"
860,00:37:33.93,00:37:33.93,"who might be a good leader,"
861,00:37:35.23,00:37:35.23,and I think that Jeanne elected Deena
862,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,"to be the leader, and we all agreed"
863,00:37:41.30,00:37:41.30,that that was a good idea.
864,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,"PROBST: Okay, Jeanne, so you elect Deena as the leader."
865,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,Is there an even distribution of work now?
866,00:37:48.70,00:37:48.70,"Um, yeah, there's an even distribution of work."
867,00:37:51.37,00:37:51.37,How is that decided?
868,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,"Is it all on Deena, or do you guys now have a routine?"
869,00:37:55.87,00:37:55.87,"Basically, we're following a routine."
870,00:37:57.70,00:37:57.70,"Whatever we're good at, that's where we go."
871,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,What are you good at?
872,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,Bringing home the food.
873,00:38:03.03,00:38:03.03,Are there roles that certain people are hunting now
874,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,and other people are maybe preparing the food?
875,00:38:07.53,00:38:07.53,JEANNE: Yeah.
876,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,"Joanna and I and Christy have been hunting,"
877,00:38:10.57,00:38:10.57,"and, uh, we come back and these guys prepare the food."
878,00:38:13.67,00:38:13.67,"Joanna, you're definitely a provider in this group."
879,00:38:16.83,00:38:16.83,"You're also a mother in real life, but I don't necessarily"
880,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,see you taking on a mother role out here.
881,00:38:21.97,00:38:21.97,"No, I've kind of left that to Deena and Jeanne."
882,00:38:24.07,00:38:24.07,I think they do it bet... a little better than I do.
883,00:38:25.70,00:38:25.70,I try to keep the spirituality
884,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,"and the emotional stability going,"
885,00:38:29.40,00:38:29.40,so I do a lot of singing and saying quotes
886,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,and doing things like that.
887,00:38:34.33,00:38:34.33,I don't have daughters. (chuckles)
888,00:38:35.77,00:38:35.77,"I have a boy and he's-he's very boyish,"
889,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,"and I'm kind of boyish, and so I let them do that."
890,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,They-They're good at it.
891,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,"Deena, when you get up in the morning,"
892,00:38:42.23,00:38:42.23,do you assess your tribe?
893,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,Is that part of your responsibility?
894,00:38:45.57,00:38:45.57,Yes.
895,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,I know who's not doing so well
896,00:38:49.07,00:38:49.07,and who is doing better than ever.
897,00:38:50.90,00:38:50.90,Give me an example of both.
898,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,Who's doing better than ever?
899,00:38:53.23,00:38:53.23,Christy.
900,00:38:54.23,00:38:54.23,Christy doesn't complain.
901,00:38:55.97,00:38:55.97,Christy just goes forward; she's right there Johnny-on-the-spot.
902,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,"Uh, Shawna's not doing well."
903,00:39:01.33,00:39:01.33,What about that concerns you?
904,00:39:03.37,00:39:03.37,"Well, obviously we want to beat the boys."
905,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,We don't want to come here again.
906,00:39:08.10,00:39:08.10,And so we need to have the physical strength
907,00:39:10.27,00:39:10.27,to get us to go on.
908,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,So that's what concerns me.
909,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,Can she contribute as much as the other members?
910,00:39:16.13,00:39:16.13,Not right now.
911,00:39:17.60,00:39:17.60,"All right, it is time to vote."
912,00:39:20.67,00:39:20.67,"Heidi, you're first."
913,00:39:36.43,00:39:36.43,"Joanna, I'm picking you tonight because you are"
914,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,"a very, very strong competitor,"
915,00:39:42.30,00:39:42.30,"and I have an alliance with other people,"
916,00:39:44.67,00:39:44.67,and that's why I'm picking you.
917,00:39:46.53,00:39:46.53,So good luck.
918,00:39:59.17,00:39:59.17,"Shawna, you're a great kid."
919,00:40:01.10,00:40:01.10,You need some TLC and get
920,00:40:02.70,00:40:02.70,yourself back into good health.
921,00:40:04.50,00:40:04.50,I'll miss you.
922,00:40:25.70,00:40:25.70,Only because you asked me to.
923,00:40:41.13,00:40:41.13,"You're an incredibly strong woman both physically,"
924,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"spiritually, mentally,"
925,00:40:46.77,00:40:46.77,but therefore you're also my biggest competition.
926,00:40:54.30,00:40:54.30,I'll go tally the votes.
927,00:41:04.10,00:41:04.10,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
928,00:41:06.40,00:41:06.40,The person voted out will be asked to leave
929,00:41:08.07,00:41:08.07,the Tribal Council area immediately.
930,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,I'll read the votes.
931,00:41:16.13,00:41:16.13,First vote:
932,00:41:18.30,00:41:18.30,Joanna.
933,00:41:22.70,00:41:22.70,Shawna.
934,00:41:28.10,00:41:28.10,Joanna. Two votes-- Joanna.
935,00:41:31.70,00:41:31.70,Shawna.
936,00:41:34.87,00:41:34.87,"Two votes-- Joanna, two votes-- Shawna."
937,00:41:42.23,00:41:42.23,Joanna.
938,00:41:43.27,00:41:43.27,"That's three votes-- Joanna, two votes-- Shawna."
939,00:41:50.77,00:41:50.77,Joanna.
940,00:41:51.80,00:41:51.80,"That's four, and that's enough."
941,00:41:52.97,00:41:52.97,The last vote will remain a mystery.
942,00:41:54.20,00:41:54.20,Need to bring me your torch.
943,00:42:04.87,00:42:04.87,"Joanna, the tribe has spoken."
944,00:42:08.83,00:42:08.83,It's time for you to go.
945,00:42:10.40,00:42:10.40,(whispers): Thank you.
946,00:42:20.97,00:42:20.97,"Well, this tribe seems to have it all together: strong leader,"
947,00:42:24.50,00:42:24.50,"things going well back at camp,"
948,00:42:26.17,00:42:26.17,but tonight's vote says otherwise.
949,00:42:28.43,00:42:28.43,"Just another reminder: don't get too comfortable in this game,"
950,00:42:31.60,00:42:31.60,because you never know what's coming next.
951,00:42:34.37,00:42:34.37,You can head back to camp. Good night.
952,00:42:50.67,00:42:50.67,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
953,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
954,00:42:58.83,00:42:58.83, Shawna remains trapped  at Jaburu.
955,00:43:01.23,00:43:01.23,"I'm at the lowest of my low, and no one is respecting"
956,00:43:03.73,00:43:03.73,the fact that I am falling apart.
957,00:43:06.47,00:43:06.47,-Cheers. -Cheers.
958,00:43:07.37,00:43:07.37,PROBST: And it's date night  for Dave and Jenna.
959,00:43:10.20,00:43:10.20,DAVE: So there's a naked girl  in the shower
960,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00, that you can see into
961,00:43:13.40,00:43:13.40," and I'm thinking,  ""This is the greatest thing"
962,00:43:14.93,00:43:14.93,"that's ever happened to me."""
963,00:43:21.60,00:43:21.60,"I'm very strong,"
964,00:43:23.37,00:43:23.37," and a lot of people  found that intimidating,"
965,00:43:24.83,00:43:24.83, particularly Deena.
966,00:43:26.13,00:43:26.13, I hope that the girls  will be able to live
967,00:43:27.70,00:43:27.70, without me catching the fish  and without me being there.
968,00:43:30.67,00:43:30.67,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah \xe2\x99\xaa
969,00:43:32.47,00:43:32.47,"\xe2\x99\xaa O, glory \xe2\x99\xaa"
