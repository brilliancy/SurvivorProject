1,00:00:01.50,00:00:01.50,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20," at Tambaqui, new friendships form."
3,00:00:05.80,00:00:05.80,"DANIEL: Matthew and I are great friends,"
4,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67, and he's a really good ally.
5,00:00:09.47,00:00:09.47,I can trust him.You can just tell.
6,00:00:10.20,00:00:10.20,PROBST: But not everyone was getting along.
7,00:00:12.13,00:00:12.13,You can handle it by yourselfor not?
8,00:00:13.90,00:00:13.90,Yeah. You're goingto go with me or what?
9,00:00:16.10,00:00:16.10,If you... I'll go do it.
10,00:00:17.33,00:00:17.33, It really got me hot.  I was tempted
11,00:00:19.47,00:00:19.47,"to slap the kid around,to be honest with you."
12,00:00:20.97,00:00:20.97,"PROBST: At Jaburu, the women"
13,00:00:22.17,00:00:22.17, had even bigger problems
14,00:00:23.27,00:00:23.27, getting it together...
15,00:00:24.40,00:00:24.40,JEANNE: We've been spinning
16,00:00:25.80,00:00:25.80," our wheels, and"
17,00:00:27.13,00:00:27.13,you can't spin your wheelsin the jungle.
18,00:00:28.77,00:00:28.77,PROBST: ...until they decided to elect a leader.
19,00:00:31.03,00:00:31.03,"I, um, initiate Deena."
20,00:00:32.70,00:00:32.70," Strategically, Joanna and I decided to put"
21,00:00:36.10,00:00:36.10, Deena up for the leadership position. I think
22,00:00:38.17,00:00:38.17,she's goingto create a little friction.
23,00:00:39.87,00:00:39.87,"PROBST: At the reward challenge,"
24,00:00:41.20,00:00:41.20, the girls won some
25,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60, much-needed bathing supplies.
26,00:00:43.97,00:00:43.97,HEIDI:  The cuter girls kind of
27,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33," went off from the older women,"
28,00:00:47.33,00:00:47.33," because we've got better bodies,"
29,00:00:48.83,00:00:48.83,"and that's, like, a huge issuewith older people."
30,00:00:50.97,00:00:50.97,PROBST: The tribes competed in a jail break for immunity.
31,00:00:53.83,00:00:53.83,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
32,00:00:55.20,00:00:55.20,-(cheering)-PROBST: Immunity--
33,00:00:56.33,00:00:56.33,Jaburu!
34,00:00:57.87,00:00:57.87, And the seven women of Jaburu
35,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17," escaped their sentence,"
36,00:01:00.63,00:01:00.63, while Tambaqui's numbers dropped to six
37,00:01:02.40,00:01:02.40, when Daniel was voted out of the tribe.
38,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,"Daniel, the tribe has spoken."
39,00:01:08.33,00:01:08.33, 13 are left.
40,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83, Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:19.27,00:02:19.27,(metallic scraping)
42,00:02:33.57,00:02:33.57,"JOANNA:Oh, Lordy."
43,00:02:35.77,00:02:35.77,"Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy."
44,00:02:37.77,00:02:37.77,(metal scraping on metal)
45,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23,Another day in the Amazon.
46,00:02:41.83,00:02:41.83,"JEANNE: Today is day number ten,"
47,00:02:44.93,00:02:44.93," and our goal was, everyone wake up early"
48,00:02:47.50,00:02:47.50, so we could start getting some shelter.
49,00:02:49.30,00:02:49.30, Everyone should be
50,00:02:50.97,00:02:50.97,"enthusiastic to work today,"
51,00:02:52.97,00:02:52.97,'cause we really have to getsome things done around here.
52,00:02:55.50,00:02:55.50,"Okay, what are we goingto do today?"
53,00:02:57.20,00:02:57.20,"We set a goal every day, and weend up accomplishing it, so..."
54,00:03:00.73,00:03:00.73,We should be going fishing
55,00:03:02.67,00:03:02.67,while everybody else collectfire wood.
56,00:03:04.00,00:03:04.00,"When I woke up, on my shift,there was no fire wood,"
57,00:03:06.70,00:03:06.70,and the fire was gone.
58,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,"I say,there's some trifling folk"
59,00:03:10.50,00:03:10.50,who was on that shiftbefore me.
60,00:03:13.33,00:03:13.33,I'll go get enough woodnow to...
61,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"JOANNA: Yeah, right.You did that yesterday."
62,00:03:17.70,00:03:17.70,I know. I don't care.
63,00:03:21.87,00:03:21.87,(chopping)
64,00:03:29.13,00:03:29.13,"SHAWNA: Every morning, I'm woken up by"
65,00:03:32.27,00:03:32.27," two girls shooting me horrendous looks,"
66,00:03:34.10,00:03:34.10," like, aren't I worthless,"
67,00:03:35.53,00:03:35.53," looking at me still in bed, and they're just"
68,00:03:37.63,00:03:37.63, constantly trying to make everyone feel bad
69,00:03:40.40,00:03:40.40, like they're not doing enough.
70,00:03:43.17,00:03:43.17,"It's gettingto be a total martyr thing,"
71,00:03:45.93,00:03:45.93,"and it's driving the tribe,especially me, up the wall."
72,00:03:49.17,00:03:49.17,JOANNA:Can we not throw babassu nut
73,00:03:51.37,00:03:51.37,shells around the bedwhere we have to sleep?
74,00:03:53.80,00:03:53.80,"Can we keep it clean, please?"
75,00:03:55.07,00:03:55.07,This is whereour heads are laying at night.
76,00:03:56.83,00:03:56.83,I don't thinkany of us meant to.
77,00:03:58.57,00:03:58.57,I'm sorry if we ended up there.
78,00:04:00.93,00:04:00.93,"HEIDI: It's always been put in our heads,"
79,00:04:03.03,00:04:03.03," the harder worker gets ahead, but this is a game."
80,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40, You have to figure out what gets you ahead
81,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60," in the game, not what gets you ahead in life, so,"
82,00:04:10.93,00:04:10.93,"my philosophy about Jeanneand Joanna is,"
83,00:04:13.87,00:04:13.87,"you want to doall this extra work,"
84,00:04:16.03,00:04:16.03,by all means do it.
85,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07," I am going to sit here and take a breath,"
86,00:04:22.47,00:04:22.47," maybe take a nap today, and I guarantee"
87,00:04:25.27,00:04:25.27,I'll probably be getting aheadof you in the game.
88,00:04:41.27,00:04:41.27,Belly's starting to rumble.
89,00:04:43.20,00:04:43.20,BUTCH:Need more fish now.
90,00:04:45.30,00:04:45.30,"MATTHEW:Not so much as a nibble, huh?"
91,00:04:48.07,00:04:48.07,Very evasive fish.
92,00:04:49.87,00:04:49.87,"Time to bite, sports fans."
93,00:04:51.93,00:04:51.93,"Yeah, it's time to bea little bit more receptive."
94,00:04:54.43,00:04:54.43,I don't thinkthey fully understand
95,00:04:55.87,00:04:55.87,just how hungry we are.
96,00:04:57.30,00:04:57.30,DAVE: We really got to step it up.
97,00:04:59.30,00:04:59.30," We're not maximizing our main food source,"
98,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63, which is this body of water that we're next to.
99,00:05:04.47,00:05:04.47," Um, pulling in little rinky-dink minnows is not"
100,00:05:07.60,00:05:07.60,"keeping seven healthy,strong guys alive,"
101,00:05:10.97,00:05:10.97," so we got to get food down, we got to get it done quick."
102,00:05:13.83,00:05:13.83,There once were three guysin a boat
103,00:05:17.13,00:05:17.13,who left earlywith spirits afloat.
104,00:05:20.33,00:05:20.33,"Looking for bass,sat on their ass."
105,00:05:24.77,00:05:24.77,Luck as good as Rob's jokes.
106,00:05:28.50,00:05:28.50,(laughter)
107,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,-(insects chirping)-There they are.
108,00:05:31.77,00:05:31.77,Successful mission?
109,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,We didn't wantto start a trend.
110,00:05:34.73,00:05:34.73,Okay.
111,00:05:36.07,00:05:36.07,BUTCH: We didn't catch any fish this morning.
112,00:05:38.03,00:05:38.03,"It's not going along very good,but we're going to keep trying."
113,00:05:40.77,00:05:40.77, So we've come up with another idea.
114,00:05:42.40,00:05:42.40, We have not used worms.
115,00:05:43.67,00:05:43.67,The reason whywe haven't used worms yet is
116,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,because we haven't goneand looked for them.
117,00:05:47.80,00:05:47.80,We're on worm safari.
118,00:05:53.73,00:05:53.73,MATTHEW: I think that
119,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83, these worms are most likely everywhere.
120,00:05:58.00,00:05:58.00, There's no reason to go on a long
121,00:06:00.70,00:06:00.70,expeditionand exhaust yourself.
122,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67, But those guys are probably going collectively
123,00:06:05.03,00:06:05.03," to somewhat exclude me, which is"
124,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,"likely the case,but that's cool."
125,00:06:09.87,00:06:09.87,My ego can take it.
126,00:06:11.50,00:06:11.50, I think my biggest challenge to date has been starting off
127,00:06:14.53,00:06:14.53, on the wrong foot with my friendship
128,00:06:17.40,00:06:17.40," with Ryan and Dan,  and perhaps not"
129,00:06:21.00,00:06:21.00, spending enough time developing relationships
130,00:06:22.97,00:06:22.97, with other people.
131,00:06:24.43,00:06:24.43," Very often, I'm not included,  and I know it's"
132,00:06:26.53,00:06:26.53,on purpose.
133,00:06:27.90,00:06:27.90,It's intentional.
134,00:06:29.17,00:06:29.17,Oh.
135,00:06:30.87,00:06:30.87, I believe that the vote would be against me
136,00:06:33.73,00:06:33.73, if there were a Tribal Council tonight.
137,00:06:36.73,00:06:36.73,"Whoa, here we go."
138,00:06:37.90,00:06:37.90,"-Yeah, you got one?-Got one."
139,00:06:39.30,00:06:39.30,Yeah!
140,00:06:40.47,00:06:40.47,"Small, but it's a...it's a worm."
141,00:06:42.10,00:06:42.10,"Yeah, it's a worm."
142,00:06:43.27,00:06:43.27,"Ah, look at this guy."
143,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,Whoa! He's feisty.
144,00:06:45.80,00:06:45.80,"Yeah, that's a worm."
145,00:06:48.80,00:06:48.80,-What the hell is that?-Oh.
146,00:06:51.00,00:06:51.00,-Oh!-Scorpion.
147,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,Baby scorpion! Ew!
148,00:06:54.00,00:06:54.00,"DAVE: We started digging for worms and, yeah, struck gold."
149,00:06:57.00,00:06:57.00," So, I think we'll certainly be able to go in and catch all"
150,00:07:00.23,00:07:00.23," the more three-to-five-inch,"
151,00:07:01.97,00:07:01.97,"yeah, little minnows out here,and hopefully, a bass or two."
152,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70,"Well, there's a successfor the start of the day."
153,00:07:06.80,00:07:06.80,"ROGER:Yeah, that's good."
154,00:07:20.50,00:07:20.50,JOANNA:When I went back
155,00:07:22.77,00:07:22.77,"to the thing, there was anotherlittle fish caught on my..."
156,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,caught on the... thing.
157,00:07:26.23,00:07:26.23,There was anotherlittle fish?
158,00:07:27.40,00:07:27.40,Caught on the thingwhen I went
159,00:07:28.80,00:07:28.80,to go get the lineout the water.
160,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,JEANNE:Yeah. Throw it right in.
161,00:07:33.87,00:07:33.87,-I think that's another...-We have stew.
162,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,...two more bitefuls.
163,00:07:36.50,00:07:36.50,"-(Joanna laughs)-Oh, good catch."
164,00:07:37.77,00:07:37.77,-Yup.-Yeah.
165,00:07:40.87,00:07:40.87,-We have food.-I know.
166,00:07:42.23,00:07:42.23,"-That's a good thing.-Yeah, we have nourishment."
167,00:07:43.83,00:07:43.83,HEIDI: The work ethic in our camp
168,00:07:45.47,00:07:45.47, is definitely creating friction.
169,00:07:46.87,00:07:46.87, You've got
170,00:07:48.63,00:07:48.63,bigger women that have more fat to live on
171,00:07:50.77,00:07:50.77," that, obviously, can put out more effort,"
172,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53, as far as manual work.
173,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,And then you've gotthe-the smaller girls
174,00:07:56.13,00:07:56.13,"that are likethe stay-at-home women, okay?"
175,00:07:59.07,00:07:59.07,We were just allsitting over here
176,00:08:00.97,00:08:00.97,chatting on wayswe deal with not...
177,00:08:02.90,00:08:02.90,"with being here, as opposedto being in our comfort zone."
178,00:08:06.20,00:08:06.20,"My mother always tell me,""This, too, shall pass."""
179,00:08:08.37,00:08:08.37,HEIDI:Yeah.
180,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,It's not the firsthard thing I had to do.
181,00:08:12.13,00:08:12.13,"There's always sweet rewards,"
182,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63,and-and that anythingworth having
183,00:08:15.13,00:08:15.13,is worth working hard for.
184,00:08:16.60,00:08:16.60,You can't just expect stuffto come drop in your lap.
185,00:08:19.70,00:08:19.70,HEIDI:No. No...
186,00:08:20.93,00:08:20.93,"JOANNA:I mean, beauty is deceitful,"
187,00:08:22.37,00:08:22.37,"and favor is vain,but a woman that fears the Lord"
188,00:08:26.20,00:08:26.20,shall be praised.
189,00:08:27.37,00:08:27.37,(insects buzzing)
190,00:08:28.53,00:08:28.53,"Because peoplemay give you favor,"
191,00:08:30.00,00:08:30.00,"or pretendthey're your friends, whatever,"
192,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,"for their own purposeand their own gain,"
193,00:08:33.47,00:08:33.47,"and beauty will fade with time,"
194,00:08:34.93,00:08:34.93,but only your virtue
195,00:08:37.37,00:08:37.37,and your characteris what's going to last.
196,00:08:39.50,00:08:39.50,HEIDI: I'm really not sure how
197,00:08:41.90,00:08:41.90," that quote fit in with anything, except maybe"
198,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,she was just tryingto pick on the fact
199,00:08:47.30,00:08:47.30,"that we were cute girls,"
200,00:08:48.97,00:08:48.97,and we're worrying about stuffthat she's not worrying about?
201,00:08:50.83,00:08:50.83,"This, too, shall pass."
202,00:08:52.50,00:08:52.50,I've been keeping thatin the back of my mind.
203,00:08:54.93,00:08:54.93,JENNA: Don't be mad because
204,00:08:57.57,00:08:57.57,we have good bodies.
205,00:08:58.83,00:08:58.83,It's not our fault.Get over it.
206,00:09:00.43,00:09:00.43,(laughs)
207,00:09:01.93,00:09:01.93, Me and Heidi are definitely the skinnier of the group.
208,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,(laughs)
209,00:09:06.33,00:09:06.33,"And better-looking, but I think it's definitely a liability."
210,00:09:09.57,00:09:09.57, I think that's what we were both worried about.
211,00:09:11.53,00:09:11.53," We wanted to be on a tribe with some men,"
212,00:09:14.07,00:09:14.07, because with women-- they can just be
213,00:09:15.93,00:09:15.93,pissed that we have good bodiesand look okay
214,00:09:18.67,00:09:18.67,and just vote us offas easy as that.
215,00:09:25.00,00:09:25.00,(insects chirping)
216,00:09:33.27,00:09:33.27,"HEIDI: From the very beginning,"
217,00:09:34.73,00:09:34.73, I knew that I either wanted to team up
218,00:09:36.83,00:09:36.83," with Shawna or Jenna, because what happens when"
219,00:09:40.27,00:09:40.27," you're a cute little girl,"
220,00:09:41.67,00:09:41.67, it's very easy to be ganged up on.
221,00:09:43.57,00:09:43.57," So I thought, you know what?"
222,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10,If you have all the little girls
223,00:09:46.80,00:09:46.80,"against more of the biggergirls, that it's like,"
224,00:09:48.97,00:09:48.97,at least we have threeagainst somebody else.
225,00:09:50.93,00:09:50.93,"I feel really bad, though,that we're, like, getting..."
226,00:09:53.07,00:09:53.07,"You know, they're, like,"
227,00:09:54.30,00:09:54.30,"working their tail off,and we're, like..."
228,00:09:56.27,00:09:56.27,"HEIDI: This is a game, though.I mean, you've got"
229,00:09:57.97,00:09:57.97,"to play out the roles.You've got to say,"
230,00:09:59.53,00:09:59.53,"""Okay, this is my nextopponent's move."
231,00:10:01.03,00:10:01.03,"-This is how I'm going toreact."" -It's like chess."
232,00:10:03.40,00:10:03.40,"And if you can't do that, thenyou really don't deserve to win."
233,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,"I agree, I agree."
234,00:10:06.97,00:10:06.97,"You have to bea smart player, so..."
235,00:10:08.60,00:10:08.60,"SHAWNA: The older women might, uh,"
236,00:10:11.00,00:10:11.00," try to kind of mount an offensive against us,"
237,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47, trying to weed out the meek or prissy or whatever.
238,00:10:17.90,00:10:17.90," So I figured,"
239,00:10:19.53,00:10:19.53,"with my closeness to Deena,"
240,00:10:20.70,00:10:20.70,"that if we could swingDeena's vote,"
241,00:10:22.47,00:10:22.47,"then it was, you know, game on,"
242,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,that we could totallyhold our weight.
243,00:10:25.80,00:10:25.80,"And if I rely on you,and you guys rely on me,"
244,00:10:28.17,00:10:28.17,and I will not break my word.
245,00:10:29.53,00:10:29.53,-I just need to know.-Yes.
246,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,DEENA:We're cleared.
247,00:10:33.83,00:10:33.83," The other girls and I talked very briefly,"
248,00:10:35.77,00:10:35.77, and it just seemed
249,00:10:37.00,00:10:37.00, natural to me that that would be
250,00:10:39.17,00:10:39.17, a great alliance. We need four.
251,00:10:41.43,00:10:41.43, I have nothing in common with them.
252,00:10:44.43,00:10:44.43,I'm married with two children.
253,00:10:45.93,00:10:45.93,"These people are in their 20s,young, fit, and good-looking."
254,00:10:50.80,00:10:50.80,Let's go.
255,00:10:52.43,00:10:52.43,DEENA: I chose to ally myself with the younger women
256,00:10:55.20,00:10:55.20, because I think that I'm able to talk and persuade
257,00:10:58.57,00:10:58.57," the younger crowd more than I would, say, an older,"
258,00:11:01.53,00:11:01.53," established, been-around-the-block crowd."
259,00:11:04.13,00:11:04.13,"Yeah, to scoopthe fish out with."
260,00:11:05.97,00:11:05.97,It looks good.So flaky.
261,00:11:08.10,00:11:08.10,"SHAWNA: If our alliance sticks together,"
262,00:11:10.43,00:11:10.43, Joanna and Jeannie-- they're in big trouble.
263,00:11:13.23,00:11:13.23," I don't know what their plan is, but"
264,00:11:15.07,00:11:15.07,"right now,all of us are too determined."
265,00:11:18.17,00:11:18.17,"Even if we disliked each other, we'd still"
266,00:11:20.13,00:11:20.13, stick by the alliance 'cause
267,00:11:21.67,00:11:21.67,"that's the strategy of it,you know?"
268,00:11:41.87,00:11:41.87,(screeches)
269,00:11:52.87,00:11:52.87,MATTHEW: Fishing is my forte.
270,00:11:55.03,00:11:55.03, I love fishing.
271,00:11:56.60,00:11:56.60, I've been fishing ever since I was a little kid.
272,00:11:57.67,00:11:57.67,"Dude, I got a big fish.Take this."
273,00:11:59.90,00:11:59.90,"DAVE:Yeah, you do."
274,00:12:01.97,00:12:01.97,MATTHEW: I know that no one can challenge my contributions
275,00:12:05.97,00:12:05.97, to life here at the camp.
276,00:12:08.73,00:12:08.73,DAVE:It's food time for Tam-ba-shmi.

286,00:12:26.40,00:12:26.40, I'm genuinely reaching out to various individuals.
287,00:12:30.47,00:12:30.47,"Well done, Matteo."
288,00:12:31.83,00:12:31.83,MATTHEW:  While I was certainly
289,00:12:34.13,00:12:34.13," friendly with Ryan and Dan,  I am an individual."
290,00:12:37.77,00:12:37.77,Go do it. Go do it.We're hanging here.
291,00:12:39.90,00:12:39.90,MATTHEW: I think my actions
292,00:12:41.23,00:12:41.23, to turn things around have begun to show
293,00:12:43.10,00:12:43.10,"some, um..."
294,00:12:45.80,00:12:45.80,"some fruit,if I could say that."

298,00:12:58.67,00:12:58.67,All right!
299,00:13:00.33,00:13:00.33,-Is that cool or what?-That is a fish!

313,00:13:40.70,00:13:40.70,it is the value of fire.

808,00:34:49.13,00:34:49.13,-Right. -And that would havebeen a for-sure thing.
809,00:34:50.97,00:34:50.97,"JENNA: And the thing is, isonce you break down mentally--"
810,00:34:52.70,00:34:52.70,you're to the pointwhere you tell yourself
811,00:34:54.07,00:34:54.07,you're throughand you've had it--
812,00:34:55.70,00:34:55.70,then everything else goes kaput.
813,00:34:57.23,00:34:57.23,"I mean, she's falling down whenshe gets up all of a sudden."
814,00:34:59.73,00:34:59.73,DEENA:How do you feel?
815,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40,-About the situation?-Yes.
816,00:35:03.67,00:35:03.67,It's a bummerthat she feels that way.
817,00:35:05.87,00:35:05.87,JENNA: Christy iskind of like our-our wild card.
818,00:35:09.27,00:35:09.27, It's important for me and Deena and Heidi
819,00:35:11.70,00:35:11.70, to get Christy to vote on our side
820,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"because Shawna wants out,and if we let her out now,"
821,00:35:16.37,00:35:16.37,there's a possibilityof... of us
822,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67, not being able to have the majority.
823,00:35:20.73,00:35:20.73,"I know how I feel,and if Shawna wants to go first,"
824,00:35:24.23,00:35:24.23,are we putting her firstbefore Joanna?
825,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,-No.-No.
826,00:35:26.97,00:35:26.97,You're going to putJoanna first?
827,00:35:27.97,00:35:27.97,DEENA:Yes.
828,00:35:29.37,00:35:29.37,So she's not here.
829,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,HEIDI:Bye. Bye.
830,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,So basically she is chopped.
831,00:35:33.47,00:35:33.47,"By doing that, you're securingyour position as well."
832,00:35:36.53,00:35:36.53,CHRISTY: I am like a little free bird over here.
833,00:35:40.47,00:35:40.47,They want me to keep Shawna inthe game and we take out Joanna
834,00:35:44.20,00:35:44.20, because she gets on everybody's nerves.
835,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33," Joanna, however,"
836,00:35:47.37,00:35:47.37,"does get the big, monstrous fish"
837,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,and feeds us and really worksand does her job.
838,00:35:53.10,00:35:53.10,But...
839,00:35:54.60,00:35:54.60," at the same time, Shawna-- she really wants to get out."
840,00:35:58.37,00:35:58.37,And it's just likewe're making her trapped.
841,00:36:02.67,00:36:02.67,"So it's just, it's..."
842,00:36:04.63,00:36:04.63,I don't know.
843,00:36:57.23,00:36:57.23,Welcome back to Tribal Council.
844,00:36:59.23,00:36:59.23,"Not a place you want to be,I know."
845,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,Tough last three daysfor you guys.
846,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,"A long winning streak, really,"
847,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13,"and then two challengesin a row,"
848,00:37:07.13,00:37:07.13,"both based on survival,both losses."
849,00:37:09.47,00:37:09.47,"Heidi, what was the reactionof the group?"
850,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,I think we were actuallyall pretty surprised.
851,00:37:13.87,00:37:13.87,"I mean, we feel like we've gotour act together, and..."
852,00:37:16.37,00:37:16.37,"we felt like the rewardchallenge was a loss,"
853,00:37:19.47,00:37:19.47,"but we were so readyto come in and kick some butt,"
854,00:37:21.90,00:37:21.90,"so, I mean, we really weresurprised that we lost."
855,00:37:25.30,00:37:25.30,"PROBST:Last time you guys were here,"
856,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,"you were all in agreement,you needed a leader."
857,00:37:29.10,00:37:29.10,What happenedon the leadership front?
858,00:37:30.57,00:37:30.57,"We just threw out ideasof what needs to go on,"
859,00:37:33.93,00:37:33.93,"who might be a good leader,"
860,00:37:35.23,00:37:35.23,and I think thatJeanne elected Deena
861,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,"to be the leader,and we all agreed"
862,00:37:41.30,00:37:41.30,that that was a good idea.
863,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,"PROBST: Okay, Jeanne, so youelect Deena as the leader."
864,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,Is there an even distributionof work now?
865,00:37:48.70,00:37:48.70,"Um, yeah, there's an evendistribution of work."
866,00:37:51.37,00:37:51.37,How is that decided?
867,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,"Is it all on Deena, ordo you guys now have a routine?"
868,00:37:55.87,00:37:55.87,"Basically, we're followinga routine."
869,00:37:57.70,00:37:57.70,"Whatever we're good at,that's where we go."
870,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,What are you good at?
871,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,Bringing home the food.
872,00:38:03.03,00:38:03.03,Are there roles thatcertain people are hunting now
873,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,and other people are maybepreparing the food?
874,00:38:07.53,00:38:07.53,JEANNE:Yeah.
875,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,"Joanna and I and Christyhave been hunting,"
876,00:38:10.57,00:38:10.57,"and, uh, we come backand these guys prepare the food."
877,00:38:13.67,00:38:13.67,"Joanna, you're definitelya provider in this group."
878,00:38:16.83,00:38:16.83,"You're also a mother in reallife, but I don't necessarily"
879,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,see you taking ona mother role out here.
880,00:38:21.97,00:38:21.97,"No, I've kind of left thatto Deena and Jeanne."
881,00:38:24.07,00:38:24.07,I think they do it bet...a little better than I do.
882,00:38:25.70,00:38:25.70,I try to keep the spirituality
883,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,"and the emotionalstability going,"
884,00:38:29.40,00:38:29.40,so I do a lot of singingand saying quotes
885,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,and doing things like that.
886,00:38:34.33,00:38:34.33,I don't have daughters.(chuckles)
887,00:38:35.77,00:38:35.77,"I have a boyand he's-he's very boyish,"
888,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,"and I'm kind of boyish,and so I let them do that."
889,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,They-They're good at it.
890,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,"Deena, when you get upin the morning,"
891,00:38:42.23,00:38:42.23,do you assess your tribe?
892,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,Is that part ofyour responsibility?
893,00:38:45.57,00:38:45.57,Yes.
894,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,I know who's not doing so well
895,00:38:49.07,00:38:49.07,and who is doingbetter than ever.
896,00:38:50.90,00:38:50.90,Give me an example of both.
897,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,Who's doing better than ever?
898,00:38:53.23,00:38:53.23,Christy.
899,00:38:54.23,00:38:54.23,Christy doesn't complain.
900,00:38:55.97,00:38:55.97,Christy just goes forward; she'sright there Johnny-on-the-spot.
901,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,"Uh, Shawna's not doing well."
902,00:39:01.33,00:39:01.33,What about that concerns you?
903,00:39:03.37,00:39:03.37,"Well, obviously we wantto beat the boys."
904,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,We don't wantto come here again.
905,00:39:08.10,00:39:08.10,And so we need to havethe physical strength
906,00:39:10.27,00:39:10.27,to get us to go on.
907,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,So that's what concerns me.
908,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,Can she contributeas much as the other members?
909,00:39:16.13,00:39:16.13,Not right now.
910,00:39:17.60,00:39:17.60,"All right, it is time to vote."
911,00:39:20.67,00:39:20.67,"Heidi, you're first."
912,00:39:36.43,00:39:36.43,"Joanna, I'm picking you tonightbecause you are"
913,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,"a very, very strong competitor,"
914,00:39:42.30,00:39:42.30,"and I have an alliancewith other people,"
915,00:39:44.67,00:39:44.67,and that's why I'm picking you.
916,00:39:46.53,00:39:46.53,So good luck.
917,00:39:59.17,00:39:59.17,"Shawna, you're a great kid."
918,00:40:01.10,00:40:01.10,You need some TLC and get
919,00:40:02.70,00:40:02.70,yourself back into good health.
920,00:40:04.50,00:40:04.50,I'll miss you.
921,00:40:25.70,00:40:25.70,Only because you asked me to.
922,00:40:41.13,00:40:41.13,"You're an incrediblystrong woman both physically,"
923,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"spiritually, mentally,"
924,00:40:46.77,00:40:46.77,but therefore you're alsomy biggest competition.
925,00:40:54.30,00:40:54.30,I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:41:04.10,00:41:04.10,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
927,00:41:06.40,00:41:06.40,The person voted outwill be asked to leave
928,00:41:08.07,00:41:08.07,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
929,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,I'll read the votes.
930,00:41:16.13,00:41:16.13,First vote:
931,00:41:18.30,00:41:18.30,Joanna.
932,00:41:22.70,00:41:22.70,Shawna.
933,00:41:28.10,00:41:28.10,Joanna. Two votes-- Joanna.
934,00:41:31.70,00:41:31.70,Shawna.
935,00:41:34.87,00:41:34.87,"Two votes-- Joanna,two votes-- Shawna."
936,00:41:42.23,00:41:42.23,Joanna.
937,00:41:43.27,00:41:43.27,"That's three votes-- Joanna,two votes-- Shawna."
938,00:41:50.77,00:41:50.77,Joanna.
939,00:41:51.80,00:41:51.80,"That's four, and that's enough."
940,00:41:52.97,00:41:52.97,The last votewill remain a mystery.
941,00:41:54.20,00:41:54.20,Need to bring me your torch.
942,00:42:04.87,00:42:04.87,"Joanna, the tribe has spoken."
943,00:42:08.83,00:42:08.83,It's time for you to go.
944,00:42:10.40,00:42:10.40,(whispers):Thank you.
945,00:42:20.97,00:42:20.97,"Well, this tribe seems to haveit all together: strong leader,"
946,00:42:24.50,00:42:24.50,"things going well back at camp,"
947,00:42:26.17,00:42:26.17,but tonight's votesays otherwise.
948,00:42:28.43,00:42:28.43,"Just another reminder: don't gettoo comfortable in this game,"
949,00:42:31.60,00:42:31.60,because you never knowwhat's coming next.
950,00:42:34.37,00:42:34.37,You can head back to camp.Good night.
951,00:42:50.67,00:42:50.67,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
952,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
953,00:42:58.83,00:42:58.83, Shawna remains trapped at Jaburu.
954,00:43:01.23,00:43:01.23,"I'm at the lowest of my low,and no one is respecting"
955,00:43:03.73,00:43:03.73,the factthat I am falling apart.
956,00:43:06.47,00:43:06.47,-Cheers.-Cheers.
957,00:43:07.37,00:43:07.37,PROBST: And it's date night for Dave and Jenna.
958,00:43:10.20,00:43:10.20,DAVE: So there's a naked girl in the shower
959,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00, that you can see into
960,00:43:13.40,00:43:13.40," and I'm thinking, ""This is the greatest thing"
961,00:43:14.93,00:43:14.93,"that's ever happened to me."""
962,00:43:21.60,00:43:21.60,"I'm very strong,"
963,00:43:23.37,00:43:23.37," and a lot of people found that intimidating,"
964,00:43:24.83,00:43:24.83, particularly Deena.
965,00:43:26.13,00:43:26.13, I hope that the girls will be able to live
966,00:43:27.70,00:43:27.70, without me catching the fish and without me being there.
