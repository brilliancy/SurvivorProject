3,00:00:08.62,00:00:08.62,>> PROBST: For three long weeksthe Heroes had been perfecting
4,00:00:11.46,00:00:11.46,the art of failure.Villains have now won four
5,00:00:14.25,00:00:14.25,"out of five immunity challenges.To make matters worse, Colby,"
6,00:00:18.46,00:00:18.46,"a consistent winner in seasonspast, was tangled in mediocrity."
7,00:00:22.38,00:00:22.38,">> He has not done anything.It's, like, my superman sucks."
8,00:00:25.62,00:00:25.62,">> PROBST: Meanwhile, theVillains appeared"
9,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,to be invincible.>> I feel so... (growls).
10,00:00:30.92,00:00:30.92,>> You feel like a big man?>> PROBST: But the announcement
11,00:00:33.42,00:00:33.42,"of a double Tribal Council...Tonight, both tribes are voting"
12,00:00:36.04,00:00:36.04,somebody out.>> Wow.
13,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,>> PROBST: ...exposed thevillain's Achilles' heel; a rift
14,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,between Russell and Boston Rob.I don't trust Russell's ass
15,00:00:43.67,00:00:43.67,at all.He's like the hobbit on crack.
16,00:00:46.67,00:00:46.67,>> It's personal with meand Rob.
17,00:00:48.29,00:00:48.29,I don't think he knows who he'sdealing with.
18,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,">> PROBST: Danielle and Parvatiwere firmly in Russell's camp,"
19,00:00:54.75,00:00:54.75,"with Sandra, Courtney and Tysonin Rob's."
20,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,Both sides were vying for theattention of the dragon slayer
21,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,and his fair maiden.But right before Tribal Council
22,00:01:04.04,00:01:04.04,"Russell planted a seedin Tyson's head, suggesting he"
23,00:01:07.58,00:01:07.58,vote out Parvati.>> I'm going to vote for
24,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,"Parvati, and then thatwill be it."
25,00:01:12.17,00:01:12.17,"I don't like doing it,but I got to."
26,00:01:15.96,00:01:15.96,">> Deal.>> All right, man."
27,00:01:17.42,00:01:17.42,">> Yup, we're tight, dude.>> PROBST: But at the Villains'"
28,00:01:20.00,00:01:20.00,"Tribal Council, Russell pulleda double cross by giving"
29,00:01:23.25,00:01:23.25,Parvati his hiddenimmunity idol.
30,00:01:25.21,00:01:25.21,"She played the idol, Tyson tookthe bait, and Boston Rob's"
31,00:01:28.25,00:01:28.25,"closest ally went home.Tyson, the tribe has spoken."
32,00:01:32.25,00:01:32.25,"Later, when the Heroes tooktheir seats at Tribal Council,"
33,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,Colby dodged a bullet when thetribe voted out James because
34,00:01:39.54,00:01:39.54,"he was injured.Now, only five Heroes remain"
35,00:01:42.67,00:01:42.67,against eight Villains.Who will be voted out tonight?
36,00:02:02.25,00:02:02.25,">> I've played Survivorthree times now, and for the"
37,00:02:05.79,00:02:05.79,"first time in all of thosetimes, I was shocked last night."
38,00:02:10.38,00:02:10.38,I completely didn't knowwhat happened.
39,00:02:13.08,00:02:13.08,"The more and more I think aboutit, something doesn't"
40,00:02:16.62,00:02:16.62,feel right.Something just doesn't feel
41,00:02:21.79,00:02:21.79,"feel right.Let me tell you something, dude,"
42,00:02:25.58,00:02:25.58,somebody said something to him.>> He didn't want to tell you.
43,00:02:29.29,00:02:29.29,">> Who cared? That's so stupid.>> Well, he's not here anymore,"
44,00:02:34.79,00:02:34.79,is he?>> It just hurts all of us.
45,00:02:40.88,00:02:40.88,We need to knock them out.Danielle's dumb as a bag of
46,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,rocks anyway.Both Parvati and Russell can do
47,00:02:48.54,00:02:48.54,some damage.>> It's no secret that Russell
48,00:02:50.29,00:02:50.29,has a little-boy crush onParvati because he's...
49,00:02:53.67,00:02:53.67,"I mean, let's face it, he'slike a bandy-legged little"
50,00:02:56.71,00:02:56.71,"troll who, you know, sort of,like, scampers around with his"
51,00:03:00.12,00:03:00.12,"tooth missing and, you know, isin and out of the bushes and"
52,00:03:04.04,00:03:04.04,"never washes.And she pays attention to him,"
53,00:03:06.50,00:03:06.50,"And she has, like, no problemflirting with clearly anything"
54,00:03:10.08,00:03:10.08,that walks.>> My hero! (chuckles)
55,00:03:19.67,00:03:19.67,">> That was awesome last night.>> Awesome, wasn't it?"
56,00:03:23.29,00:03:23.29,">> Y'all two need, y'all twoneed just to work on Jerri."
57,00:03:29.17,00:03:29.17,(Parvati laughs)Y'all two together can
58,00:03:32.12,00:03:32.12,do it easy.(women giggling)
59,00:03:38.25,00:03:38.25,">> I don't understand how theycan be so cocky right now,"
60,00:03:41.92,00:03:41.92,"making fun of people.How can they do that, Jerri?"
61,00:03:46.67,00:03:46.67,"There's three of them, there'sfive of us."
62,00:03:50.83,00:03:50.83,"(giggling continues)I was born at night, but not"
63,00:03:53.92,00:03:53.92,"last night.To me, it's ridiculous that"
64,00:03:57.12,00:03:57.12,three people would have so muchconfidence unless something else
65,00:04:01.25,00:04:01.25,was going on.>> I'm so crafty. (laughs)
66,00:04:05.12,00:04:05.12,>> I don't know if theywere just excited because
67,00:04:08.17,00:04:08.17,"they pulled over a big, stupidmove or if they think that"
68,00:04:11.58,00:04:11.58,they have numbers on the otherside and the merge is coming
69,00:04:14.75,00:04:14.75,"soon, or possibly if two ofthose people that are sitting"
70,00:04:17.50,00:04:17.50,with me in the tent pretendingto be mad at the other three
71,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,"are actually with them, and thejoke's on me."
72,00:04:48.00,00:04:48.00,"(Danielle groans)>> What's up, girl?"
73,00:04:53.54,00:04:53.54,">> I didn't sleep for crap, man.>> I didn't either."
74,00:04:56.29,00:04:56.29,>> It was cold.>> It was cold.
75,00:04:58.21,00:04:58.21,>> My blanket was halfway offmy body.
76,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,That's why I was freezing.>> That was hard.
77,00:05:03.88,00:05:03.88,>> Rob started yet?>> Started?
78,00:05:07.58,00:05:07.58,>> Started his rantingand raving?
79,00:05:10.50,00:05:10.50,">> No, everybody's stillsleeping-- well, relatively"
80,00:05:13.38,00:05:13.38,sleeping.I think everybody's really
81,00:05:15.71,00:05:15.71,depressed.>> I ain't depressed.
82,00:05:19.62,00:05:19.62,They're depressed.>> Yeah.
83,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,">> Just think of you as on theouts like them, you know?"
84,00:05:27.04,00:05:27.04,Depressed like thatand going mad.
85,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,That ain't a good feeling.>> No.
86,00:05:31.08,00:05:31.08,">> If you have a tight alliancewith four people, five people,"
87,00:05:35.21,00:05:35.21,"you can get all the way downto the end if you, if you"
88,00:05:38.71,00:05:38.71,stick together.That's how people get
89,00:05:40.38,00:05:40.38,far in this game.>> I think Jerri has all kind
90,00:05:44.88,00:05:44.88,"of respect for me now, becauseI put my butt on the line for"
91,00:05:48.08,00:05:48.08,somebody else.Now she has an alliance that
92,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,she has to start a relationshipwith.
93,00:05:54.38,00:05:54.38,Jerri hated Parvati.I brought them together.
94,00:05:58.67,00:05:58.67,But I'm that good where I canbring people together in this
95,00:06:02.04,00:06:02.04,game for my good.>> I'm just...
96,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,"I'm afraid to commit.I mean, I'll be honest."
97,00:06:07.71,00:06:07.71,I-I've had my trepidationswith you from the beginning.
98,00:06:12.08,00:06:12.08,">> If people are worriedabout me, then, I mean, there's"
99,00:06:14.75,00:06:14.75,"just-- what can I say?I've been, like, (laughs)"
100,00:06:17.25,00:06:17.25,I've been the target ofevery single vote because
101,00:06:19.96,00:06:19.96,everyone thinks I'm gonna getwith my people.
102,00:06:23.25,00:06:23.25,Why would I do that?Because it doesn't make sense
103,00:06:26.38,00:06:26.38,"for me leave a solid tribe.>> I guess it's, maybe"
104,00:06:29.08,00:06:29.08,I have fears of commitment.Maybe that's why I've been
105,00:06:32.04,00:06:32.04,single for three years.(laughs)
106,00:06:35.96,00:06:35.96,It hurts my brain.>> Jerri's completely
107,00:06:38.46,00:06:38.46,noncommittal.I thought I was noncommittal.
108,00:06:41.25,00:06:41.25,"She's, like, ""People have hurt""my feelings in the past, and"
109,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"""I've just not gotten over that""for 38 years."
110,00:06:47.29,00:06:47.29,"""I've been harboring resentment""for the people that have lied"
111,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,"to me and hurt my feelings.""Well, listen, crazy pants,"
112,00:06:54.21,00:06:54.21,"it's like a 3-3 split right now:It's me, Russell, and Danielle"
113,00:06:57.92,00:06:57.92,"on one side, Rob, Sandra andCourtney on the other side,"
114,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,"Coach and Jerri right inthe middle, you know?"
115,00:07:02.71,00:07:02.71,"They don't know which way to go.""Which way do we go?"""
116,00:07:12.17,00:07:12.17,>> Isn't it proof?The girls in Micronesia.
117,00:07:17.58,00:07:17.58,">> It's up to you.I mean, like, we can't do"
118,00:07:20.75,00:07:20.75,anything else other thantop four.
119,00:07:24.88,00:07:24.88,That's it.But I think Jerri is leaning
120,00:07:28.75,00:07:28.75,more towards coming with usbecause she saw what Russell
121,00:07:31.96,00:07:31.96,"did for me, and I think, Ithink Jerri's a little bit"
122,00:07:34.88,00:07:34.88,"jealous that a man hasn't donethat for her, so I think she"
123,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,wants to take a chance forwith Russell.
124,00:07:39.62,00:07:39.62,Maybe he'll save her life andshe can have a hero.
125,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,(birds calling)>> It's really cold.
126,00:08:07.08,00:08:07.08,">> Oh, God, my knees hurt.Everything sucks."
127,00:08:13.62,00:08:13.62,"Poor James, damn it.If we ever needed somebody to"
128,00:08:17.75,00:08:17.75,"step up, we need Colby to stepup today."
129,00:08:21.21,00:08:21.21,"Tribal Council last night, weended up putting James out of"
130,00:08:27.21,00:08:27.21,our camp.I don't know exactly if that
131,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"was the right decision or not,but we've got to keep strong."
132,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,We cannot let the Villainskeep winning.
133,00:08:39.04,00:08:39.04,">> Unbelievable.I have survived two, if not"
134,00:08:43.12,00:08:43.12,"three huge Tribal Councilswhere going into them, I was"
135,00:08:45.79,00:08:45.79,"convinced I was going home,but, uh, here I am."
136,00:08:49.42,00:08:49.42,">> Oh, my God, he's going tocome back with a vengeance."
137,00:08:52.08,00:08:52.08,>> Yeah.>> He's got something to
138,00:08:53.58,00:08:53.58,prove today.>> There's a little bit of
139,00:08:55.25,00:08:55.25,"pressure on me to perform'cause clearly, if James' knee"
140,00:08:58.04,00:08:58.04,"had held up, I wouldn't be here.So now it's put up or shut up"
141,00:09:02.62,00:09:02.62,time for Colby.I'll do everything I can to
142,00:09:05.12,00:09:05.12,make you guys realize you madethe right decision.

566,00:30:53.83,00:30:53.83,"of keeping Rob in, besideskeeping the tribe strong?"
567,00:30:55.42,00:30:55.42,He's a mover and a shaker.>> I say we can.
568,00:30:57.21,00:30:57.21,">> I mean, he can't be trusted.>> And you agree with it, and"
569,00:30:59.21,00:30:59.21,she agrees with it.Parvati would.

579,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,>> I'm with you guys 100%.I came here to win this game.
580,00:31:31.79,00:31:31.79,Not at all costs.I don't want Boston Rob to go
581,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,home.That's what you can see on my
582,00:31:37.29,00:31:37.29,face right now.I don't want him going home.
583,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,He doesn't deserve to go home.He deserves to be here and play
584,00:31:41.79,00:31:41.79,this game.I can't go back on my word.
585,00:31:44.46,00:31:44.46,"I mean, I just gave those guysmy word because Russell crammed"
586,00:31:46.75,00:31:46.75,"it down our throats, and Jerri'sbeing gullible, and just saying,"
587,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,"okay, whatever.And then I'm sitting there like"
588,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,a fish out of water.What am I going to do?
589,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,"So now, if I go against them,then, you know, I broke my word."
590,00:31:59.71,00:31:59.71,I want to be true to Boston Rob.(sighs)
591,00:32:12.54,00:32:12.54,>> This game is such a trip.>> They're coming after me.

595,00:32:20.88,00:32:20.88,"It's hard.Don't sweat it, Jerri, you know?"
596,00:32:24.17,00:32:24.17,It's a hard decision.You got to do what's best for
597,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,"you.>> It's giving me a headache,"
598,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,man.>> Do what you think is best
599,00:32:30.75,00:32:30.75,for you.I don't even see it as that much
600,00:32:33.29,00:32:33.29,"of a choice.Like, you know what to do."
601,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,"(Jerri laughs)You do, but you're..."
602,00:32:43.58,00:32:43.58,I am at your mercy.I don't have a leg to stand on.

605,00:32:54.38,00:32:54.38,>> I can't.>> But you can trust me in this

608,00:33:03.33,00:33:03.33,Because I don't really have anyother choice.
609,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,"You're smart, Jerri.You figure it out."
610,00:33:10.08,00:33:10.08,(Jerri laughs)You know what to do.
611,00:33:19.67,00:33:19.67,"(sighs)>> I feel like I've aged, like,"
612,00:33:23.96,00:33:23.96,"five years in one day.I mean, Rob literally told me..."
613,00:33:28.21,00:33:28.21,"He said, ""Look, Jerri, you know,just do whatever you got to do"

635,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,somebody that kind of bridgedthe gap.

639,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,And that's another group.And then you've got Jerri and I
640,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,"have been the floaters.So, as you can see, it's just"
641,00:35:06.38,00:35:06.38,like everybody is going indifferent directions.
642,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"And Tyson was the guy, in myopinion, that bridged that gap."
643,00:35:11.25,00:35:11.25,">> Well, see, I don't agree withthat at all."
644,00:35:13.38,00:35:13.38,>> I disagree with thatcompletely.

652,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,This is not a tribe that'sworking together.
653,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,>> It's not a tribe that'sworking together.
654,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,And I agree with Coach.I think losing Tyson was a big
655,00:35:46.25,00:35:46.25,"mistake, and it hurt ustremendously."
