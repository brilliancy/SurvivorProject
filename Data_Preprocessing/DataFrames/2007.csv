1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:04.04,00:00:04.04,Survivor: Villains win immunity!
3,00:00:06.96,00:00:06.96,">> Yes! >> Oh, my God!"
4,00:00:08.62,00:00:08.62,>> PROBST: For three long weeks the Heroes had been perfecting
5,00:00:11.46,00:00:11.46,the art of failure. Villains have now won four
6,00:00:14.25,00:00:14.25,"out of five immunity challenges. To make matters worse, Colby,"
7,00:00:18.46,00:00:18.46,"a consistent winner in seasons past, was tangled in mediocrity."
8,00:00:22.38,00:00:22.38,">> He has not done anything. It's, like, my superman sucks."
9,00:00:25.62,00:00:25.62,">> PROBST: Meanwhile, the Villains appeared"
10,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,to be invincible. >> I feel so... (growls).
11,00:00:30.92,00:00:30.92,>> You feel like a big man? >> PROBST: But the announcement
12,00:00:33.42,00:00:33.42,"of a double Tribal Council... Tonight, both tribes are voting"
13,00:00:36.04,00:00:36.04,somebody out. >> Wow.
14,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,>> PROBST: ...exposed the villain's Achilles' heel; a rift
15,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,between Russell and Boston Rob. I don't trust Russell's ass
16,00:00:43.67,00:00:43.67,at all. He's like the hobbit on crack.
17,00:00:46.67,00:00:46.67,>> It's personal with me and Rob.
18,00:00:48.29,00:00:48.29,I don't think he knows who he's dealing with.
19,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,">> PROBST: Danielle and Parvati were firmly in Russell's camp,"
20,00:00:54.75,00:00:54.75,"with Sandra, Courtney and Tyson in Rob's."
21,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,Both sides were vying for the attention of the dragon slayer
22,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,and his fair maiden. But right before Tribal Council
23,00:01:04.04,00:01:04.04,"Russell planted a seed in Tyson's head, suggesting he"
24,00:01:07.58,00:01:07.58,vote out Parvati. >> I'm going to vote for
25,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,"Parvati, and then that will be it."
26,00:01:12.17,00:01:12.17,"I don't like doing it, but I got to."
27,00:01:15.96,00:01:15.96,">> Deal. >> All right, man."
28,00:01:17.42,00:01:17.42,">> Yup, we're tight, dude. >> PROBST: But at the Villains'"
29,00:01:20.00,00:01:20.00,"Tribal Council, Russell pulled a double cross by giving"
30,00:01:23.25,00:01:23.25,Parvati his hidden immunity idol.
31,00:01:25.21,00:01:25.21,"She played the idol, Tyson took the bait, and Boston Rob's"
32,00:01:28.25,00:01:28.25,"closest ally went home. Tyson, the tribe has spoken."
33,00:01:32.25,00:01:32.25,"Later, when the Heroes took their seats at Tribal Council,"
34,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,Colby dodged a bullet when the tribe voted out James because
35,00:01:39.54,00:01:39.54,"he was injured. Now, only five Heroes remain"
36,00:01:42.67,00:01:42.67,against eight Villains. Who will be voted out tonight?
37,00:02:02.25,00:02:02.25,">> I've played Survivor three times now, and for the"
38,00:02:05.79,00:02:05.79,"first time in all of those times, I was shocked last night."
39,00:02:10.38,00:02:10.38,I completely didn't know what happened.
40,00:02:13.08,00:02:13.08,"The more and more I think about it, something doesn't"
41,00:02:16.62,00:02:16.62,feel right. Something just doesn't feel
42,00:02:21.79,00:02:21.79,"feel right. Let me tell you something, dude,"
43,00:02:25.58,00:02:25.58,somebody said something to him. >> He didn't want to tell you.
44,00:02:29.29,00:02:29.29,">> Who cared? That's so stupid. >> Well, he's not here anymore,"
45,00:02:34.79,00:02:34.79,is he? >> It just hurts all of us.
46,00:02:40.88,00:02:40.88,We need to knock them out. Danielle's dumb as a bag of
47,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,rocks anyway. Both Parvati and Russell can do
48,00:02:48.54,00:02:48.54,some damage. >> It's no secret that Russell
49,00:02:50.29,00:02:50.29,has a little-boy crush on Parvati because he's...
50,00:02:53.67,00:02:53.67,"I mean, let's face it, he's like a bandy-legged little"
51,00:02:56.71,00:02:56.71,"troll who, you know, sort of, like, scampers around with his"
52,00:03:00.12,00:03:00.12,"tooth missing and, you know, is in and out of the bushes and"
53,00:03:04.04,00:03:04.04,"never washes. And she pays attention to him,"
54,00:03:06.50,00:03:06.50,"And she has, like, no problem flirting with clearly anything"
55,00:03:10.08,00:03:10.08,that walks. >> My hero! (chuckles)
56,00:03:19.67,00:03:19.67,">> That was awesome last night. >> Awesome, wasn't it?"
57,00:03:23.29,00:03:23.29,">> Y'all two need, y'all two need just to work on Jerri."
58,00:03:29.17,00:03:29.17,(Parvati laughs) Y'all two together can
59,00:03:32.12,00:03:32.12,do it easy. (women giggling)
60,00:03:38.25,00:03:38.25,">> I don't understand how they can be so cocky right now,"
61,00:03:41.92,00:03:41.92,"making fun of people. How can they do that, Jerri?"
62,00:03:46.67,00:03:46.67,"There's three of them, there's five of us."
63,00:03:50.83,00:03:50.83,"(giggling continues) I was born at night, but not"
64,00:03:53.92,00:03:53.92,"last night. To me, it's ridiculous that"
65,00:03:57.12,00:03:57.12,three people would have so much confidence unless something else
66,00:04:01.25,00:04:01.25,was going on. >> I'm so crafty. (laughs)
67,00:04:05.12,00:04:05.12,>> I don't know if they were just excited because
68,00:04:08.17,00:04:08.17,"they pulled over a big, stupid move or if they think that"
69,00:04:11.58,00:04:11.58,they have numbers on the other side and the merge is coming
70,00:04:14.75,00:04:14.75,"soon, or possibly if two of those people that are sitting"
71,00:04:17.50,00:04:17.50,with me in the tent pretending to be mad at the other three
72,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,"are actually with them, and the joke's on me."
73,00:04:48.00,00:04:48.00,"(Danielle groans) >> What's up, girl?"
74,00:04:53.54,00:04:53.54,">> I didn't sleep for crap, man. >> I didn't either."
75,00:04:56.29,00:04:56.29,>> It was cold. >> It was cold.
76,00:04:58.21,00:04:58.21,>> My blanket was halfway off my body.
77,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,That's why I was freezing. >> That was hard.
78,00:05:03.88,00:05:03.88,>> Rob started yet? >> Started?
79,00:05:07.58,00:05:07.58,>> Started his ranting and raving?
80,00:05:10.50,00:05:10.50,">> No, everybody's still sleeping-- well, relatively"
81,00:05:13.38,00:05:13.38,sleeping. I think everybody's really
82,00:05:15.71,00:05:15.71,depressed. >> I ain't depressed.
83,00:05:19.62,00:05:19.62,They're depressed. >> Yeah.
84,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,">> Just think of you as on the outs like them, you know?"
85,00:05:27.04,00:05:27.04,Depressed like that and going mad.
86,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,That ain't a good feeling. >> No.
87,00:05:31.08,00:05:31.08,">> If you have a tight alliance with four people, five people,"
88,00:05:35.21,00:05:35.21,"you can get all the way down to the end if you, if you"
89,00:05:38.71,00:05:38.71,stick together. That's how people get
90,00:05:40.38,00:05:40.38,far in this game. >> I think Jerri has all kind
91,00:05:44.88,00:05:44.88,"of respect for me now, because I put my butt on the line for"
92,00:05:48.08,00:05:48.08,somebody else. Now she has an alliance that
93,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,she has to start a relationship with.
94,00:05:54.38,00:05:54.38,Jerri hated Parvati. I brought them together.
95,00:05:58.67,00:05:58.67,But I'm that good where I can bring people together in this
96,00:06:02.04,00:06:02.04,game for my good. >> I'm just...
97,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,"I'm afraid to commit. I mean, I'll be honest."
98,00:06:07.71,00:06:07.71,I-I've had my trepidations with you from the beginning.
99,00:06:12.08,00:06:12.08,">> If people are worried about me, then, I mean, there's"
100,00:06:14.75,00:06:14.75,"just-- what can I say? I've been, like, (laughs)"
101,00:06:17.25,00:06:17.25,I've been the target of every single vote because
102,00:06:19.96,00:06:19.96,everyone thinks I'm gonna get with my people.
103,00:06:23.25,00:06:23.25,Why would I do that? Because it doesn't make sense
104,00:06:26.38,00:06:26.38,"for me leave a solid tribe. >> I guess it's, maybe"
105,00:06:29.08,00:06:29.08,I have fears of commitment. Maybe that's why I've been
106,00:06:32.04,00:06:32.04,single for three years. (laughs)
107,00:06:35.96,00:06:35.96,It hurts my brain. >> Jerri's completely
108,00:06:38.46,00:06:38.46,noncommittal. I thought I was noncommittal.
109,00:06:41.25,00:06:41.25,"She's, like, ""People have hurt ""my feelings in the past, and"
110,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"""I've just not gotten over that ""for 38 years."
111,00:06:47.29,00:06:47.29,"""I've been harboring resentment ""for the people that have lied"
112,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,"to me and hurt my feelings."" Well, listen, crazy pants,"
113,00:06:54.21,00:06:54.21,"it's like a 3-3 split right now: It's me, Russell, and Danielle"
114,00:06:57.92,00:06:57.92,"on one side, Rob, Sandra and Courtney on the other side,"
115,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,"Coach and Jerri right in the middle, you know?"
116,00:07:02.71,00:07:02.71,"They don't know which way to go. ""Which way do we go?"""
117,00:07:12.17,00:07:12.17,>> Isn't it proof? The girls in Micronesia.
118,00:07:17.58,00:07:17.58,">> It's up to you. I mean, like, we can't do"
119,00:07:20.75,00:07:20.75,anything else other than top four.
120,00:07:24.88,00:07:24.88,That's it. But I think Jerri is leaning
121,00:07:28.75,00:07:28.75,more towards coming with us because she saw what Russell
122,00:07:31.96,00:07:31.96,"did for me, and I think, I think Jerri's a little bit"
123,00:07:34.88,00:07:34.88,"jealous that a man hasn't done that for her, so I think she"
124,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,wants to take a chance for with Russell.
125,00:07:39.62,00:07:39.62,Maybe he'll save her life and she can have a hero.
126,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,(birds calling) >> It's really cold.
127,00:08:07.08,00:08:07.08,">> Oh, God, my knees hurt. Everything sucks."
128,00:08:13.62,00:08:13.62,"Poor James, damn it. If we ever needed somebody to"
129,00:08:17.75,00:08:17.75,"step up, we need Colby to step up today."
130,00:08:21.21,00:08:21.21,"Tribal Council last night, we ended up putting James out of"
131,00:08:27.21,00:08:27.21,our camp. I don't know exactly if that
132,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"was the right decision or not, but we've got to keep strong."
133,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,We cannot let the Villains keep winning.
134,00:08:39.04,00:08:39.04,">> Unbelievable. I have survived two, if not"
135,00:08:43.12,00:08:43.12,"three huge Tribal Councils where going into them, I was"
136,00:08:45.79,00:08:45.79,"convinced I was going home, but, uh, here I am."
137,00:08:49.42,00:08:49.42,">> Oh, my God, he's going to come back with a vengeance."
138,00:08:52.08,00:08:52.08,>> Yeah. >> He's got something to
139,00:08:53.58,00:08:53.58,prove today. >> There's a little bit of
140,00:08:55.25,00:08:55.25,"pressure on me to perform 'cause clearly, if James' knee"
141,00:08:58.04,00:08:58.04,"had held up, I wouldn't be here. So now it's put up or shut up"
142,00:09:02.62,00:09:02.62,time for Colby. I'll do everything I can to
143,00:09:05.12,00:09:05.12,make you guys realize you made the right decision.
144,00:09:19.62,00:09:19.62,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Villains getting your first"
145,00:09:27.42,00:09:27.42,look at the new Hero tribe. James voted out the last
146,00:09:30.17,00:09:30.17,Tribal Council. You guys ready to get to
147,00:09:36.17,00:09:36.17,today's reward challenge? >> Yes.
148,00:09:37.50,00:09:37.50,">> Oh, yeah! >> PROBST: For today's"
149,00:09:39.21,00:09:39.21,"challenge, three members of each tribe will race through"
150,00:09:41.38,00:09:41.38,the water to get a ball. You must then work together
151,00:09:44.12,00:09:44.12,until you can shoot your ball in your basket while members of
152,00:09:48.12,00:09:48.12,the other tribe attempt to stop you any way they can.
153,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,"Each time you get a ball in your basket, you score a point"
154,00:09:53.79,00:09:53.79,for your tribe. First tribe to three
155,00:09:55.42,00:09:55.42,wins reward. Want to know what you're
156,00:09:57.33,00:09:57.33,playing for? >> Yeah.
157,00:09:58.75,00:09:58.75,>> Yeah! >> Yes!
158,00:09:59.79,00:09:59.79,>> PROBST: The winning tribe will leave here and be taken to
159,00:10:02.25,00:10:02.25,an outdoor waterfall. You'll enjoy a nice healthy
160,00:10:05.21,00:10:05.21,"lunch. You'll have beef, chicken,"
161,00:10:07.17,00:10:07.17,"tuna... >> Oh, yeah."
162,00:10:08.04,00:10:08.04,>> PROBST: ...fresh fruit. Should send you back to camp
163,00:10:11.88,00:10:11.88,"completely rejuvenated. Villains, you have three extra"
164,00:10:14.29,00:10:14.29,members; sitting three people people out.
165,00:10:16.08,00:10:16.08,Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges.
166,00:10:18.08,00:10:18.08,"You have to sit out three women. Courtney, Sandra..."
167,00:10:21.83,00:10:21.83,>> Me. >> PROBST: ...and Parvati.
168,00:10:23.21,00:10:23.21,Sit-outs take a spot on the bench.
169,00:10:24.96,00:10:24.96,"Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize."
170,00:10:26.88,00:10:26.88,We will start three men on three men.
171,00:10:33.08,00:10:33.08,"All right, here we go, first round."
172,00:10:35.00,00:10:35.00,"We'll have one person under the goal, two people on the flag."
173,00:10:38.12,00:10:38.12,Survivors ready? Go!
174,00:10:40.62,00:10:40.62,">> Come on, guys! Come on, Colby!"
175,00:10:43.83,00:10:43.83,>> PROBST: Rupert has it for the Heroes.
176,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,Russell can't even catch him. Rupert waltzing in.
177,00:10:50.54,00:10:50.54,Rob tries to steal it for the Villains.
178,00:10:53.17,00:10:53.17,J.T. now has it. Coach takes down J.T.
179,00:10:57.38,00:10:57.38,Colby has it for the Heroes! Just misses!
180,00:10:59.88,00:10:59.88,">> Come on, Colby. Get it in there!"
181,00:11:01.67,00:11:01.67,"Colby, get it! >> PROBST: Colby with another"
182,00:11:04.17,00:11:04.17,shot! Just misses.
183,00:11:06.42,00:11:06.42,">> Come on, Rob, get it! >> PROBST: that ball's wide"
184,00:11:09.08,00:11:09.08,open. Rob and Colby going for it.
185,00:11:11.04,00:11:11.04,Big scramble for the ball. Coach now has it for
186,00:11:14.58,00:11:14.58,the Villains! Coach now with a free shot.
187,00:11:17.62,00:11:17.62,">> Wide open, Coach! >> PROBST: Not even close."
188,00:11:19.83,00:11:19.83,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Coach with the"

194,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,Next round. Two women from each tribe
195,00:11:40.92,00:11:40.92,along with one man. Heroes lead it one-zip.
196,00:11:44.21,00:11:44.21,"We're playing to three. >> Let's go, girls."

199,00:11:55.46,00:11:55.46,"leaving Amanda open. Once again, Coach and Colby"
200,00:11:58.12,00:11:58.12,matching up. Colby has had Coach's number in
201,00:12:01.71,00:12:01.71,this challenge. He eludes him again.
202,00:12:04.54,00:12:04.54,Colby comes up short. Coach now for the Villains.
203,00:12:08.75,00:12:08.75,">> Get it, Colby! >> Just hold him, Candice."
204,00:12:12.12,00:12:12.12,">> Coach, it's a chick! Come on!"
205,00:12:13.58,00:12:13.58,"Get it to Danielle! >> Get it, Jerri!"
206,00:12:15.88,00:12:15.88,"Get in there, Jerri! >> Come on, Jerri!"
207,00:12:18.04,00:12:18.04,">> PROBST: Colby now takes it from Jerri, over to Candice."
208,00:12:22.21,00:12:22.21,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Candice in and out"
209,00:12:24.12,00:12:24.12,for the Heroes. Candice misses.
210,00:12:25.71,00:12:25.71,"Coach has it again, launches a long shot."
211,00:12:28.17,00:12:28.17,Colby just tosses Jerri out of the way.
212,00:12:31.25,00:12:31.25,Heroes way more aggressive in this challenge.
213,00:12:34.00,00:12:34.00,Colby to a wide-open Amanda. Danielle blocks Amanda twice.
214,00:12:39.29,00:12:39.29,"Candice has it for the Heroes, Candice scores for the Heroes!"
215,00:12:43.08,00:12:43.08,"Heroes lead two-zip! >> Good work, team!"
216,00:12:47.96,00:12:47.96,">> Yeah. PROBST: Next round, the men are"
217,00:12:52.71,00:12:52.71,back out. This could be it.
218,00:12:54.75,00:12:54.75,Heroes lead 2-zip. Villains have yet to get on
219,00:12:58.21,00:12:58.21,the board. We are playing to three.
220,00:13:00.25,00:13:00.25,">> Come on, Heroes! Finish it off right now!"

222,00:13:05.75,00:13:05.75,J.T. sprinting after that ball. Nobody even close to him.
223,00:13:10.29,00:13:10.29,Russell takes Rupert down. They're going at it.
224,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,"J.T. has it, passes to Colby underneath the goal."
225,00:13:19.29,00:13:19.29,This challenge is over! Heroes win reward!
226,00:13:28.25,00:13:28.25,>> Yeah! Yeah! >> We won! Whoo!
227,00:13:35.04,00:13:35.04,">> PROBST: Villains, got nothing for you."
228,00:13:37.25,00:13:37.25,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
229,00:13:39.17,00:13:39.17,"Heroes, been a while since you've had something to"
230,00:13:41.83,00:13:41.83,to celebrate. >> Whoo!
231,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,">> Yes! >> PROBST: Grab your stuff,"
232,00:13:44.54,00:13:44.54,"head out, enjoy it. >> Thanks, Probst."
233,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,">> Have a good day, Jeff. I know we will."
234,00:13:48.29,00:13:48.29,">> We dropped the hammer on the Villains, and for me"
235,00:13:52.21,00:13:52.21,"personally, I had a lot riding on this."
236,00:13:54.38,00:13:54.38,A win like this today not only buys me a little more time but
237,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,it relieves the tension in my in my tribe.
238,00:14:22.12,00:14:22.12,">> Oh, my... >> Today just proves that we are"
239,00:14:25.12,00:14:25.12,a family. We're together.
240,00:14:27.12,00:14:27.12,We're a much stronger team than they are right now.
241,00:14:29.12,00:14:29.12,"We've got them on our heels, and it's time for a little"
242,00:14:31.00,00:14:31.00,redemption. >> To Heroes!
243,00:14:33.00,00:14:33.00,>> To Heroes! >> Love you!
244,00:14:35.00,00:14:35.00,">> Fantastic Five! >> Oh, look at these!"
245,00:14:37.00,00:14:37.00,>> Yes! >> They are.
246,00:14:39.00,00:14:39.00,>> Oh. >> I'm going to have some beef.
247,00:14:40.83,00:14:40.83,>> I want some beef. >> Oh!
248,00:14:44.83,00:14:44.83,">> If we stay together, us five, nobody can stop us, guys."
249,00:14:48.54,00:14:48.54,">> Mmm. >> You guys, there's another"
250,00:14:50.54,00:14:50.54,immunity idol. >> What are you reading?
251,00:14:52.54,00:14:52.54,>> At our beach. >> What?
252,00:14:54.54,00:14:54.54,">> Do you want to just read it later, and we'll all read it?"
253,00:14:56.54,00:14:56.54,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
254,00:14:58.58,00:14:58.58,>> All right. >> When Candice pulled that
255,00:15:04.92,00:15:04.92,"letter out, it brought the game back home."
256,00:15:08.38,00:15:08.38,"Before then, we were out of the game."
257,00:15:11.04,00:15:11.04,We were having a meal. We were having a nice time as
258,00:15:13.92,00:15:13.92,"our Fantastic Five. >> Of course, we all tried to"
259,00:15:20.29,00:15:20.29,"ignore the clue. We had such a good time, such a"
260,00:15:25.00,00:15:25.00,"good thing going for a few minutes, and the game still"
261,00:15:27.88,00:15:27.88,"creeps back in. >> Just couldn't wait, could"
262,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,"you, Amanda? >> Well, if you're going to"
263,00:15:32.04,00:15:32.04,"read it, read it out loud so everybody can hear it."
264,00:15:33.92,00:15:33.92,">> Yeah, give everybody the details."
265,00:15:35.92,00:15:35.92,Got to read it out loud. >> Calm down.
266,00:15:37.92,00:15:37.92,"I was just wondering. ""Another immunity idol is"
267,00:15:39.67,00:15:39.67,hidden at your camp. Stroll down your beach to the
268,00:15:41.67,00:15:41.67,"river's bed. Atop the second bridge, you'll"
269,00:15:44.58,00:15:44.58,see a tree rooted where two currents meet.
270,00:15:48.12,00:15:48.12,"Behind it, in a shallow grave, it shall be."""
271,00:15:50.62,00:15:50.62,>> Let's not let that come between us.
272,00:15:52.67,00:15:52.67,">> Yup. >> If y'all want, we'll go look"
273,00:15:55.42,00:15:55.42,for it together. That is for us to use against
274,00:15:58.50,00:15:58.50,the Villains. >> Yup.
275,00:16:00.54,00:16:00.54,">> And the cool thing was, immediately, all five players"
276,00:16:03.92,00:16:03.92,"agreed. When we do find it, we'll find"
277,00:16:06.88,00:16:06.88,"it as a tribe, and that is a unified front."
278,00:16:10.12,00:16:10.12,And we're all in agreement on that.
279,00:16:12.17,00:16:12.17,"We're now fighting the good fight as a team, and that's the"
280,00:16:15.04,00:16:15.04,most positive thing to come from today was realizing that we are
281,00:16:19.62,00:16:19.62,now a tribe of five that is very ready to take on the Villains.
282,00:16:32.42,00:16:32.42,">> Are you with us? >> Well, I'll admit, this"
283,00:16:35.25,00:16:35.25,"morning I woke up, I didn't know where my head was at or"
284,00:16:38.04,00:16:38.04,"where I was going, or... whatever, and now, I'm..."
285,00:16:44.04,00:16:44.04,"It's like the sun came out, and I'm, like, ""You know what?"
286,00:16:47.50,00:16:47.50,"It's pretty clear as day to me now."""
287,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,">> You know, I don't want to swear on my family or anything."
288,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,"I'm so... with me, you and Coach."
289,00:16:55.71,00:16:55.71,"That's who I want. >> Hey, Coach, come here."
290,00:16:59.54,00:16:59.54,">> Sit down, Coach. You know, man, I want to..."
291,00:17:04.38,00:17:04.38,I don't how else to explain that you can trust me.
292,00:17:08.71,00:17:08.71,You and Jerri I want to take to the top three.
293,00:17:11.25,00:17:11.25,That's what I want. That's what...
294,00:17:13.25,00:17:13.25,"From the bottom of my heart, that's what I want."
295,00:17:15.54,00:17:15.54,Parvati-- I don't think I can beat her for the million.
296,00:17:18.04,00:17:18.04,"I want to take you all to the top three, man, and that's what"
297,00:17:21.00,00:17:21.00,what I want. >> Russell is empowered by this
298,00:17:24.33,00:17:24.33,"game, because with all the gullible people out here, he"
299,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,thinks that he can outtalk anybody.
300,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,"So next thing I know, when I come over there to join the"
301,00:17:32.25,00:17:32.25,"conversation-- after I'm beckoned over, because I don't"
302,00:17:34.29,00:17:34.29,"want to seem paranoid and go right up and listen in or say,"
303,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"""What's going on?""-- Russell is just sitting there just"
304,00:17:40.25,00:17:40.25,"spinning a pure line of gold, and Jerri's just hook, line and"
305,00:17:45.04,00:17:45.04,sinker. >> I'm telling you that I've
306,00:17:47.71,00:17:47.71,"made my decision, and I hope and pray that you're going to be"
307,00:17:51.67,00:17:51.67,"there, 'cause you are the only other person in this game that I"
308,00:17:55.46,00:17:55.46,"can literally look at in the eyes, and say, ""I trust you"
309,00:17:59.58,00:17:59.58,"100%."" And if it's just Russell and not"
310,00:18:03.79,00:18:03.79,"you, I'm not going to feel comfortable, 'cause I've been"
311,00:18:06.25,00:18:06.25,"with you since day one. >> Yeah, Jerri and I are"
312,00:18:12.12,00:18:12.12,"honor-bound to play this game together, but if Jerri says,"
313,00:18:16.08,00:18:16.08,"""I'm in this wholeheartedly with Russell,"" I really have no"
314,00:18:19.83,00:18:19.83,"choice. So, it's just... It's just..."
315,00:18:22.12,00:18:22.12,"I don't know. It's just, the waters are so"
316,00:18:24.21,00:18:24.21,muddy right now... and Jerri has muddied them.
317,00:18:28.79,00:18:28.79,">> Honestly, what Russell pulled off last night at Tribal"
318,00:18:32.62,00:18:32.62,Council-- it took huge balls. I don't trust Rob.
319,00:18:37.08,00:18:37.08,"We have a history, and we're old school players, and all that"
320,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,"nonsense. You know, I wanted to trust him"
321,00:18:42.54,00:18:42.54,"because of that, but I realize Rob is not trustworthy."
322,00:18:45.38,00:18:45.38,He's not. He proved it.
323,00:18:47.46,00:18:47.46,>> He proved it six years ago when he was playing a different
324,00:18:50.17,00:18:50.17,"game, and every time he said he's going to vote for somebody"
325,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,"in this game so far, he's done it, but I don't want to talk"
326,00:18:55.33,00:18:55.33,"about that first. I'm kind of hurt, because you"
327,00:18:59.25,00:18:59.25,"sit there in front of Russell and me and say, ""Russell, I'm"
328,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67,"in. I just hope that Coach is, too,"
329,00:19:06.54,00:19:06.54,but I'm in. I hope he makes the same
330,00:19:08.88,00:19:08.88,"decision."" You didn't talk to me about it."
331,00:19:11.17,00:19:11.17,"You know, I mean, that... I think that's what hurts."
332,00:19:13.75,00:19:13.75,You want to lump me and Russell together in terms of trust.
333,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"That's crazy. I mean, you just said right now"
334,00:19:20.46,00:19:20.46,"that, you know, basically, that you trust he and I equal, and I"
335,00:19:23.25,00:19:23.25,"hope that that's not the case... >> No, it's not."
336,00:19:25.25,00:19:25.25,">> ...because, you know that you've had bad feelings about"
337,00:19:27.25,00:19:27.25,Russell. >> It's not the case.
338,00:19:29.25,00:19:29.25,"I'll clear that up right now. It's not the case, because..."
339,00:19:33.92,00:19:33.92,"You know, it's just not. And, I mean, you and I are in a"
340,00:19:38.29,00:19:38.29,"really good position, and I'm... It just..."
341,00:19:43.67,00:19:43.67,You know what? It just finally made sense to
342,00:19:45.96,00:19:45.96,me. >> I just can't believe you just
343,00:19:48.75,00:19:48.75,threw all your eggs into Russell's basket.
344,00:19:52.17,00:19:52.17,">> Well... I wouldn't say, all my eggs."
345,00:19:57.00,00:19:57.00,"So as much as I like Coach, that guy is so naive."
346,00:20:00.58,00:20:00.58,"Like, Russell is in this game to play it, and he's in it to win"
347,00:20:05.12,00:20:05.12,it. And you know what?
348,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,"So am I. So as much as I like Coach, and"
349,00:20:10.25,00:20:10.25,"as much as I trust him, I mean, I don't see someone who gets it,"
350,00:20:15.21,00:20:15.21,"like, in the grand scheme of this game."
351,00:20:17.88,00:20:17.88,He's almost dead set against manipulating anybody.
352,00:20:21.25,00:20:21.25,"He wants to be the good guy to everyone, and you can't."
353,00:20:24.62,00:20:24.62,You can't be the good guy to everyone and win this game.
354,00:20:40.04,00:20:40.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! All right, you guys ready to get"
355,00:20:47.25,00:20:47.25,to today's immunity challenge? >> Yes.
356,00:20:50.17,00:20:50.17,>> Let's do it! >> PROBST: First things first.
357,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,I will take back the individual immunity necklaces from last
358,00:20:54.25,00:20:54.25,"time. Thank you, Candice."
359,00:20:56.38,00:20:56.38,"Thanks, Rob. Individual immunity-- not today."
360,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,Tribal immunity is once again back up for grabs.
361,00:21:07.96,00:21:07.96,"For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will race"
362,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,relay-style up a platform and across a net.
363,00:21:14.58,00:21:14.58,You'll then climb up a large rope web to retrieve bags of
364,00:21:18.42,00:21:18.42,puzzle pieces. Once you've collected all six
365,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,"bags, the two remaining tribe members must use those pieces"
366,00:21:24.08,00:21:24.08,to solve a puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins
367,00:21:26.50,00:21:26.50,"immunity, guaranteed at least one more day in this game."
368,00:21:30.62,00:21:30.62,Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted
369,00:21:32.71,00:21:32.71,"out. Villains, you have three extra"
370,00:21:34.75,00:21:34.75,members. Cannot sit out the same people
371,00:21:37.04,00:21:37.04,in back-to-back challenges. Who are the three you're gonna
372,00:21:39.04,00:21:39.04,"sit out? >> Myself, Danielle and Russell."
373,00:21:43.42,00:21:43.42,">> PROBST: Jerri, Danielle and Russell sitting out."

470,00:26:18.96,00:26:18.96,"Villains, Tribal Council tonight."
471,00:26:20.96,00:26:20.96,One of the eight of you going home.
472,00:26:23.25,00:26:23.25,You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be.
473,00:26:25.88,00:26:25.88,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
474,00:26:28.00,00:26:28.00,See you at Tribal. >> I thought Courtney was
475,00:26:30.00,00:26:30.00,"lagging. Poor girl, you know, she was,"
476,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"like, almost broken in half out there."
477,00:26:34.00,00:26:34.00,We need to get rid of Courtney tonight.
478,00:26:36.00,00:26:36.00,She's the weak link. >> We just got back from our
479,00:26:49.96,00:26:49.96,"immunity challenge, and got our butts kicked."
480,00:26:54.46,00:26:54.46,Rob-- he got his butt kicked today.
481,00:26:57.50,00:26:57.50,Sandra wasn't doing anything on the puzzle.
482,00:27:00.25,00:27:00.25,Courtney looked like she was about to break in half out
483,00:27:02.58,00:27:02.58,there. It was one of the most pitiful
484,00:27:05.17,00:27:05.17,"performances I have ever seen. Yeah, right now, the Heroes are"
485,00:27:09.08,00:27:09.08,"starting to win. Uh, we have to do something."
486,00:27:12.79,00:27:12.79,>> What do you think? >> I think we need to weed off
487,00:27:15.08,00:27:15.08,the weak. >> Who do you suggest?
488,00:27:18.46,00:27:18.46,>> One of these. >> One of who?
489,00:27:22.21,00:27:22.21,>> Right here. What do you want me to say?
490,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,">> I don't know. >> You want me to be, you"
491,00:27:31.04,00:27:31.04,know...? >> That's not a way to gather
492,00:27:33.08,00:27:33.08,"friends, I don't think. >> Well, you know."
493,00:27:36.46,00:27:36.46,>> (laughing): How do you two feel about that?
494,00:27:38.75,00:27:38.75,">> I don't like it. >> Oh, no, I think..."
495,00:27:40.75,00:27:40.75,"I think he's right. >> What kind of logic is that,"
496,00:27:43.21,00:27:43.21,Russell? That's a new one.
497,00:27:45.92,00:27:45.92,>> No hard feelings for nobody. It's really just a game for me.
498,00:27:49.29,00:27:49.29,I don't put my... >> I don't think I ever quite
499,00:27:51.67,00:27:51.67,heard that... Sit with someone and tell
500,00:27:53.79,00:27:53.79,"someone that, I want to vote you or you off."
501,00:27:56.12,00:27:56.12,I never heard that approach before.
502,00:27:58.17,00:27:58.17,>> You never? >> No.
503,00:28:00.25,00:28:00.25,>> You'd be amazed how good that approach works sometimes.
504,00:28:02.46,00:28:02.46,">> That's a new one. >> Well, if Rob's gonna vote for"
505,00:28:04.75,00:28:04.75,"one of us, he's obviously not going to say it in front of us,"
506,00:28:07.58,00:28:07.58,and we're not gonna vote for ourselves.
507,00:28:09.58,00:28:09.58,">> Oh, I'm not gonna vote for one of you."
508,00:28:11.58,00:28:11.58,">> All Rob wants is to keep his alliance strong, which I"
509,00:28:13.88,00:28:13.88,"understand, 'cause he knows, once Courtney leaves, he's at my"
510,00:28:17.54,00:28:17.54,mercy. I'm after him.
511,00:28:21.04,00:28:21.04,He's after me. May the best man win.
512,00:28:23.67,00:28:23.67,Whoever's better in the game-- that's which one is going to be
513,00:28:27.04,00:28:27.04,"here longer, and it's going to be me, and he sees it coming."
514,00:28:32.33,00:28:32.33,>> Tough one. What's the plan?
515,00:28:36.88,00:28:36.88,">> We've got two decisions. Blindside Parvati, or get rid"
516,00:28:41.00,00:28:41.00,of Courtney and regroup the alliance.
517,00:28:43.75,00:28:43.75,"'Cause that was pathetic today, dude, and I..."
518,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,"Dude, in Courtney, man, I don't know what you see, man."
519,00:28:49.08,00:28:49.08,She is the w... We have to dance around every
520,00:28:51.75,00:28:51.75,challenge because of Courtney. And Sandra.
521,00:28:54.58,00:28:54.58,">> She's loyal. I mean, that's something that"
522,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,"you value, right? It's something I value, too."
523,00:29:01.38,00:29:01.38,You really think Parvati's more of a threat than Russell at this
524,00:29:04.21,00:29:04.21,point? I'll make a strong case for
525,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,"Russell because I think he's dangerous, Coach."
526,00:29:11.04,00:29:11.04,"And from day one, I haven't trusted him, and I don't..."
527,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,"I still don't. Not that I trust Parvati,"
528,00:29:17.79,00:29:17.79,"either. But, I mean, how does Jerri"
529,00:29:20.17,00:29:20.17,feel? >> I haven't talked to her.
530,00:29:22.25,00:29:22.25,I talked to you first 'cause you're my right-hand man.
531,00:29:24.71,00:29:24.71,"I mean, dude, I'm telling you right now, as sure as anything,"
532,00:29:28.12,00:29:28.12,I want to be standing there with you on the last day.
533,00:29:31.00,00:29:31.00,>> We will be. We will be. >> All right.
534,00:29:33.04,00:29:33.04,>> You have my word. I'm voting for Russell.
535,00:29:35.04,00:29:35.04,I have yours? >> Yup.
536,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,>> Okay. >> Let's get that little bastard
537,00:29:39.08,00:29:39.08,out of here. >> That's it. That's it.
538,00:29:42.08,00:29:42.08,"You know, one way to make somebody do what you want them"
539,00:29:44.92,00:29:44.92,to do is to find what they hold dear.
540,00:29:48.33,00:29:48.33,"With Coach, it's his reputation for being loyal."
541,00:29:52.17,00:29:52.17,And put that on the line. You're saying that you're
542,00:29:55.12,00:29:55.12,"giving your word, and that you're the most loyal?"
543,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,"You better do what you say you do, or let it be known that"
544,00:30:00.75,00:30:00.75,"you're a liar. >> All right, well, Courtney"
545,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,"tonight, and then it will be Sandra."
546,00:30:07.12,00:30:07.12,Get rid of them two snakes right off the bat.
547,00:30:09.75,00:30:09.75,">> Where's Parvati? >> She's back at camp, I think."
548,00:30:14.08,00:30:14.08,">> I know, man. You know what? He's been trying to get rid of"
549,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,"you since day one, and that takes a pretty big man to not"
550,00:30:18.08,00:30:18.08,"make the target. >> Right. I mean, I'm trying to"
551,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,keep the team strong. He's constantly trying to get
552,00:30:22.08,00:30:22.08,rid of me. >> Constantly.
553,00:30:27.50,00:30:27.50,">> We got to... We got... I tell you, mean, we got..."
554,00:30:29.08,00:30:29.08,>> I want to so bad. >> I know you do.
555,00:30:31.17,00:30:31.17,">> I want to so bad. >> You're a big man for not,"
556,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,though. I got to give it to you.
557,00:30:34.92,00:30:34.92,>> I know. We could do it now. >> Let's think about this.
558,00:30:36.75,00:30:36.75,">> That's just disgusting, man. >> Let's think about this a"
559,00:30:38.58,00:30:38.58,while. Me and Coach-- we can beat any
560,00:30:40.42,00:30:40.42,two guys they pair up. I don't care. In anything.
561,00:30:42.42,00:30:42.42,">> Wow. >> We can all do that, man."
562,00:30:44.42,00:30:44.42,"We can... >> Right, now, but I just..."
563,00:30:46.29,00:30:46.29,I feel like the right thing to do is Courtney.
564,00:30:48.12,00:30:48.12,It's going to make our tribe stronger.
565,00:30:50.21,00:30:50.21,I feel like the right thing to do is Courtney.
566,00:30:52.00,00:30:52.00,">> What do you think, Jerri? >> I mean, what's the positive"
567,00:30:53.83,00:30:53.83,"of keeping Rob in, besides keeping the tribe strong?"
568,00:30:55.42,00:30:55.42,He's a mover and a shaker. >> I say we can.
569,00:30:57.21,00:30:57.21,">> I mean, he can't be trusted. >> And you agree with it, and"
570,00:30:59.21,00:30:59.21,she agrees with it. Parvati would.
571,00:31:01.29,00:31:01.29,"That's four votes, Coach. >> Come on, man."
572,00:31:03.29,00:31:03.29,>> I'm ready to get rid of that fool.
573,00:31:05.21,00:31:05.21,>> I know. Let's not do it. I don't feel right about it.
574,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,>> Why? >> Yeah. Why?
575,00:31:09.04,00:31:09.04,>> It's the perfect time before the merge.
576,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,">> Dude, I don't feel right about it."
577,00:31:12.88,00:31:12.88,">> Dude, I feel the merge is coming."
578,00:31:14.62,00:31:14.62,">> Rob is, like, the biggest threat right now."
579,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,">> If you give me your word, I'll believe you."
580,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,>> I'm with you guys 100%. I came here to win this game.
581,00:31:31.79,00:31:31.79,Not at all costs. I don't want Boston Rob to go
582,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,home. That's what you can see on my
583,00:31:37.29,00:31:37.29,face right now. I don't want him going home.
584,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,He doesn't deserve to go home. He deserves to be here and play
585,00:31:41.79,00:31:41.79,this game. I can't go back on my word.
586,00:31:44.46,00:31:44.46,"I mean, I just gave those guys my word because Russell crammed"
587,00:31:46.75,00:31:46.75,"it down our throats, and Jerri's being gullible, and just saying,"
588,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,"okay, whatever. And then I'm sitting there like"
589,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,a fish out of water. What am I going to do?
590,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,"So now, if I go against them, then, you know, I broke my word."
591,00:31:59.71,00:31:59.71,I want to be true to Boston Rob. (sighs)
592,00:32:12.54,00:32:12.54,>> This game is such a trip. >> They're coming after me.
593,00:32:14.88,00:32:14.88,>> You think so? >> They want me out?
594,00:32:16.88,00:32:16.88,>> You think so? >> I don't know. I'm asking you.
595,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,">> Oh, I don't know. >> No?"
596,00:32:20.88,00:32:20.88,"It's hard. Don't sweat it, Jerri, you know?"
597,00:32:24.17,00:32:24.17,It's a hard decision. You got to do what's best for
598,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,"you. >> It's giving me a headache,"
599,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,man. >> Do what you think is best
600,00:32:30.75,00:32:30.75,for you. I don't even see it as that much
601,00:32:33.29,00:32:33.29,"of a choice. Like, you know what to do."
602,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,"(Jerri laughs) You do, but you're..."
603,00:32:43.58,00:32:43.58,I am at your mercy. I don't have a leg to stand on.
604,00:32:47.04,00:32:47.04,">> I mean, you know, I would love to just go, ""Hey, Rob, you"
605,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,"know, I trust you 100%,"" but... >> But you shouldn't?"
606,00:32:54.38,00:32:54.38,>> I can't. >> But you can trust me in this
607,00:32:56.92,00:32:56.92,"situation, because you can always trust somebody when they"
608,00:33:00.38,00:33:00.38,have... when their backs are against the wall.
609,00:33:03.33,00:33:03.33,Because I don't really have any other choice.
610,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,"You're smart, Jerri. You figure it out."
611,00:33:10.08,00:33:10.08,(Jerri laughs) You know what to do.
612,00:33:19.67,00:33:19.67,"(sighs) >> I feel like I've aged, like,"
613,00:33:23.96,00:33:23.96,"five years in one day. I mean, Rob literally told me..."
614,00:33:28.21,00:33:28.21,"He said, ""Look, Jerri, you know, just do whatever you got to do"
615,00:33:31.08,00:33:31.08,"to get yourself as far in the game as you can, and if it's at"
616,00:33:34.17,00:33:34.17,"my expense, I... I understand. It's a game."""
617,00:33:39.25,00:33:39.25,>> You know that it's not the right time to get rid of Boston
618,00:33:41.92,00:33:41.92,"Rob, right? 'Cause if that happens, you"
619,00:33:45.21,00:33:45.21,"know, like, challenge-wise, I'm not for that at all."
620,00:33:50.08,00:33:50.08,At all. >> I'm not a good villain.
621,00:33:53.75,00:33:53.75,(Jerri laughs) >> Not a good what?
622,00:33:56.29,00:33:56.29,>> I'm not a good villain. I'm just not.
623,00:34:12.88,00:34:12.88,">> PROBST: For the first 15 days of this game, you guys were"
624,00:34:15.58,00:34:15.58,"dominating, but then, the Heroes have stumbled onto this magic"
625,00:34:19.12,00:34:19.12,number of five and have destroyed you guys.
626,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,"So, Sandra, how is tonight's vote different?"
627,00:34:25.38,00:34:25.38,"Before, you guys thought you had no competition out there."
628,00:34:28.92,00:34:28.92,">> Um, I think we're all over the board."
629,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,It's going to be all kinds of names and numbers out there
630,00:34:33.62,00:34:33.62,"today. I don't know what to tell you,"
631,00:34:35.96,00:34:35.96,"Jeff. >> PROBST: Coach, if Sandra's"
632,00:34:38.00,00:34:38.00,"right, is that indicative of a tribe in trouble?"
633,00:34:41.42,00:34:41.42,">> I think that at the dawn of every morning, hope springs"
634,00:34:44.67,00:34:44.67,"eternal. I personally saw, with the"
635,00:34:47.21,00:34:47.21,"absence of Tyson, not only a great competitor, but also"
636,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,somebody that kind of bridged the gap.
637,00:34:52.71,00:34:52.71,">> PROBST: Where's the gap? >> I mean, you've got, um, you"
638,00:34:55.79,00:34:55.79,"know, Sandra and Courtney. They're tight with Boston Rob."
639,00:34:58.42,00:34:58.42,"And then you've got Danielle, Russell and Parvati."
640,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,And that's another group. And then you've got Jerri and I
641,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,"have been the floaters. So, as you can see, it's just"
642,00:35:06.38,00:35:06.38,like everybody is going in different directions.
643,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"And Tyson was the guy, in my opinion, that bridged that gap."
644,00:35:11.25,00:35:11.25,">> Well, see, I don't agree with that at all."
645,00:35:13.38,00:35:13.38,>> I disagree with that completely.
646,00:35:15.38,00:35:15.38,">> I think by getting rid of him, it solidified a stronger"
647,00:35:18.08,00:35:18.08,"group of people. >> PROBST: But Danielle, you and"
648,00:35:22.29,00:35:22.29,Russell disagreeing with what Coach says confirms what Coach
649,00:35:25.21,00:35:25.21,says. >> People can have different
650,00:35:27.83,00:35:27.83,"opinions, even if they're on the same tribe."
651,00:35:30.38,00:35:30.38,">> PROBST: Rob, you had one of the craziest Tribal Councils"
652,00:35:33.67,00:35:33.67,last time that I've ever seen-- 20 seasons.
653,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,This is not a tribe that's working together.
654,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,>> It's not a tribe that's working together.
655,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,And I agree with Coach. I think losing Tyson was a big
656,00:35:46.25,00:35:46.25,"mistake, and it hurt us tremendously."
657,00:35:50.04,00:35:50.04,>> But I could have blindsided anybody that night.
658,00:35:52.62,00:35:52.62,"My alliance, Parvati, was about to go home."
659,00:35:56.54,00:35:56.54,So I made the best move I thought that was possible.
660,00:35:59.46,00:35:59.46,And it was my decision. >> And a lot of people are mad
661,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,"about it, and a lot of people haven't gotten over it, and it"
662,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,shows in challenges. >> I personally don't think that
663,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,that's true. I think that a lot of us are
664,00:36:09.79,00:36:09.79,"giving 100%, but everybody is so damn paranoid about"
665,00:36:13.62,00:36:13.62,"alliances, and it's going to continue to be like that."
666,00:36:17.04,00:36:17.04,">> It's catastrophic, because some people are thinking in"
667,00:36:20.50,00:36:20.50,"terms of keeping their alliance strong, instead of keeping the"
668,00:36:24.62,00:36:24.62,"team strong. >> Well, you know what?"
669,00:36:26.96,00:36:26.96,He put my name down. He didn't know I was going to
670,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,blindside Tyson. That's keeping the team strong?
671,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,>> I think it is keeping the team strong.
672,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,">> I'm going to use Rob's quote. ""If you ain't with me, you're"
673,00:36:37.17,00:36:37.17,"against me."" >> That's right, and you are"
674,00:36:39.29,00:36:39.29,against me. It's clear.
675,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,"And, I mean, there's been no secret about that, Russell."
676,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,"What I'm saying, my idea of trust and loyalty is different"
677,00:36:49.21,00:36:49.21,from Russell's. >> Loyalty?
678,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,I put my butt on the line for my...
679,00:36:54.04,00:36:54.04,>> I saw what you did. >> ...for my people.
680,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,>> I saw what you did. >> I was willing to go home.
681,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,"If that ain't loyal, I don't know what is."
682,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,I don't think you have the guts to do what I did last Tribal.
683,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,">> Okay, you're entitled to your opinion."
684,00:37:07.46,00:37:07.46,">> If you're gunning for me, you're not going to get what you"
685,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,"want, not with me. You're going to have to go."
686,00:37:14.00,00:37:14.00,">> PROBST: Coach, where's your level of trust with these guys?"
687,00:37:17.21,00:37:17.21,">> I mean, I see two soldiers on opposite ends of the spectrum."
688,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,You hear the fight in both of them.
689,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,You hear the independence in both of them.
690,00:37:24.92,00:37:24.92,"So, I know that the lines have been drawn in the sand today,"
691,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,but I'm begging you guys to reconsider and keep this tribe
692,00:37:34.04,00:37:34.04,"strong. I mean, we can still win every"
693,00:37:36.58,00:37:36.58,"single challenge, but not if our best competitors are going to be"
694,00:37:41.50,00:37:41.50,"at war with each other. >> But at some point, you pick"
695,00:37:44.46,00:37:44.46,"someone to trust, and you go with that, and that's all there"
696,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"is to do, and I did that. And I think tonight's vote is"
697,00:37:53.04,00:37:53.04,going to be to bring this tribe closer together.
698,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,">> PROBST: Jerri, literally, you're sitting in the middle of"
699,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,"this group, and your name has not come up at all."
700,00:38:02.88,00:38:02.88,">> I've been confronted, one by one by, by everybody in this"
701,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,"tribe, and both sides have some positives and some negatives,"
702,00:38:11.25,00:38:11.25,and I've tried to weigh both. So I'm forced to make a
703,00:38:14.62,00:38:14.62,"decision, and I'm hoping that it's the right one, and I don't"
704,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,"know for sure if it is, sometimes, but I have decided"
705,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,"that I have to believe it is. >> PROBST: Well, there's no"
706,00:38:30.04,00:38:30.04,doubt that tonight's Tribal Council is going to mark a
707,00:38:32.88,00:38:32.88,turning point for this tribe. Let's get to it.
708,00:38:35.58,00:38:35.58,"Danielle, you're up. >> It's game over."
709,00:38:52.54,00:38:52.54,It's either you or me. >> I'm making a choice tonight
710,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,in hopes that this will be right for me in the end.
711,00:39:22.17,00:39:22.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
712,00:39:33.75,00:39:33.75,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
713,00:39:36.21,00:39:36.21,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
714,00:39:38.54,00:39:38.54,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
715,00:39:44.75,00:39:44.75,First vote-- Rob. Russell.
716,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,"Rob. Two votes-- Rob, one vote--"
717,00:39:55.71,00:39:55.71,Russell. Russell.
718,00:39:59.33,00:39:59.33,"We're tied. Two votes-- Rob, two votes--"
719,00:40:01.42,00:40:01.42,Russell. Rob.
720,00:40:05.58,00:40:05.58,That's three votes Rob. Tied again.
721,00:40:12.17,00:40:12.17,"Three votes-- Rob, three votes-- Russell."
722,00:40:17.92,00:40:17.92,"Courtney. That's three votes-- Rob, three"
723,00:40:21.46,00:40:21.46,"votes-- Russell, one vote-- Courtney."
724,00:40:23.46,00:40:23.46,One vote left. Eighth person voted out of
725,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains-- Rob.
726,00:40:37.58,00:40:37.58,"You need to bring me your torch. >> PROBST: Rob, the tribe has"
727,00:40:53.21,00:40:53.21,"spoken. Well, that is without question,"
728,00:41:12.29,00:41:12.29,the biggest move this tribe has made in the game thus far.
729,00:41:15.21,00:41:15.21,"Good news is, not going to take long at all to find out if"
730,00:41:18.08,00:41:18.08,voting out Rob brings this tribe back together or destroys it.
731,00:41:22.21,00:41:22.21,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
732,00:41:25.04,00:41:25.04,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
733,00:41:40.08,00:41:40.08,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
734,00:41:46.58,00:41:46.58,"Survivor-- the competition gets dirty, but the real battle is at"
735,00:41:49.04,00:41:49.04,"the Villain's camp, where every alliance crumbles."
736,00:41:51.42,00:41:51.42,>> Coach is a pathological liar. >> Russell is a bully.
737,00:41:53.46,00:41:53.46,>> Every single person on this team is an idiot.
738,00:41:55.54,00:41:55.54,">> I can't stand Jerri, I hate Coach, I hate Danielle, I hate"
739,00:41:58.17,00:41:58.17,Russell even more. Why are you blaming me and
740,00:42:00.54,00:42:00.54,Courtney? >> No.
741,00:42:02.54,00:42:02.54,">> Pray for the merge. >> I mean, I saw it coming"
742,00:42:10.54,00:42:10.54,tonight. It's tough.
743,00:42:12.54,00:42:12.54,These guys-- they knew what they were doing.
