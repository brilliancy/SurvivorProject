837,00:28:58.62,00:28:58.62,I WAS LIKE I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A
838,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,"MASSAGE FOR A DOZEN DONUTS, BUDDY."
839,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,>> THAT IS COFFEE!
840,00:29:06.46,00:29:06.46,SMELL THAT.
841,00:29:07.58,00:29:07.58,">> SURE ENOUGH, I PICK UP THE"
842,00:29:08.62,00:29:08.62,"COFFEE, YOU KNOW, AFTER EATING,"
843,00:29:09.79,00:29:09.79,EVERYONE IS DISTRACTED BY THE
844,00:29:11.12,00:29:11.12,"FOOD, I SWIRL IT AROUND A LITTLE"
845,00:29:12.79,00:29:12.79,"BIT AND GIVE IT A SMELL, AND"
846,00:29:13.88,00:29:13.88,AS I'M SMELLING I SEE WHAT LOOKS
847,00:29:16.00,00:29:16.00,LIKE TO BE A LITTLE ROLL OF PAPER.
848,00:29:18.21,00:29:18.21,"SURE ENOUGH, ROB SAW THE SAME THING."
849,00:29:19.79,00:29:19.79,HOW DO YOU DO?
850,00:29:20.83,00:29:20.83,"YOU GOT ALL YOUR TRIBE AROUND, LOOKING."
851,00:29:22.08,00:29:22.08,"BUT NOBODY CAUGHT IT, I DON'T THINK."
852,00:29:23.62,00:29:23.62,>> DO YOU GUYS WANT TO SAVE THE CROISSANTS FOR TOMORROW?
853,00:29:25.83,00:29:25.83,>> THAT SOUNDS GREAT. >> DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?
854,00:29:28.46,00:29:28.46,>> GRANT SET A BLOCK FOR ME.
855,00:29:30.12,00:29:30.12,"I WAS GOING TO PUT IT DOWN MY PANTS BUT IF I DO THAT,"
856,00:29:34.38,00:29:34.38,IT'S TOO OBVIOUS I HAVE IT ON ME.
857,00:29:36.33,00:29:36.33,I WAS LIKE HOW CAN I GET THIS
858,00:29:37.92,00:29:37.92,WHOLE THING OVER THERE SO I CAN
859,00:29:38.88,00:29:38.88,MAKE HIM COME BACK TO THE CAMP.
860,00:29:40.83,00:29:40.83,WHEN GRANT TURNED THE OTHER WAY
861,00:29:42.25,00:29:42.25,HE SET A PICK FOR ME AND I WENT
862,00:29:43.38,00:29:43.38,AROUND THE OUTSIDE.
863,00:29:45.04,00:29:45.04,IT WAS LIKE A WELL-CHOREOGRAPHED
864,00:29:46.21,00:29:46.21,FOOTBALL PLAY.
865,00:29:48.75,00:29:48.75,>> HAND IT TO ME.
866,00:29:52.29,00:29:52.29,>> I'LL BRING IT BACK TO CAMP. I'LL HIDE THIS.
867,00:30:07.04,00:30:07.04,>> YUMMY. >> AREN'T THOSE GREAT?
868,00:30:09.62,00:30:09.62,">> SMELL THIS, DUDE!"
869,00:30:11.50,00:30:11.50,THIS IS THE DARKEST--
870,00:30:13.04,00:30:13.04,>> NOW THAT'S REAL COFFEE.
871,00:30:13.96,00:30:13.96,">> THAT'S REAL COFFEE, RIGHT?"
872,00:30:18.58,00:30:18.58,>> I'M GOING TO GO SWITCH THIS
873,00:30:20.50,00:30:20.50,WITH THE CLUE THAT I ALREADY HAVE.
874,00:30:22.88,00:30:22.88,AND GIVE 'EM THE FIRST CLUE AND
875,00:30:24.54,00:30:24.54,KEEP THIS ONE.
876,00:30:26.12,00:30:26.12,SO WE GOTTA MOVE.
877,00:30:32.92,00:30:32.92,TODAY'S A GOOD DAY.
878,00:30:34.00,00:30:34.00,WHAT CAN I SAY?
879,00:30:35.21,00:30:35.21,NOT ONLY DID WE WIN IMMUNITY AND
880,00:30:37.46,00:30:37.46,"REWARD, BUT I GOT VERY LUCKY AND"
881,00:30:39.92,00:30:39.92,HAD SOMEONE HAND ME THE CLUE TO
882,00:30:42.46,00:30:42.46,THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND I
883,00:30:44.21,00:30:44.21,JUST WENT TO GO HIDE IT FOR HIM.
884,00:30:46.88,00:30:46.88,"UNBEKNOWNST TO GRANT, I RAN TO"
885,00:30:48.62,00:30:48.62,MY STASH AND MY ORIGINAL HIDDEN
886,00:30:50.12,00:30:50.12,IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE THEY HAD
887,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,"BURIED, SWAPPED THEM OUT AND PUT"
888,00:30:55.00,00:30:55.00,THE ORIGINAL CLUE IN MY HAND IN
889,00:30:57.58,00:30:57.58,PLACE OF THE ONE THAT HE THINKS
890,00:30:59.00,00:30:59.00,THAT WE TOOK OUT OF THE COFFEE.
891,00:31:00.67,00:31:00.67,THAT FIRST CLUE IS SO RIDICULOUS.
892,00:31:02.54,00:31:02.54,"IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT, LIKE,"
893,00:31:03.96,00:31:03.96,LOOKING IN THE SAND AND UNDER A
894,00:31:05.12,00:31:05.12,"ROCK OR MAYBE IN A TREE, DIG FOR"
895,00:31:06.21,00:31:06.21,"IT, CLIMB FOR IT."
896,00:31:07.33,00:31:07.33,WHO KNOWS?
897,00:31:08.54,00:31:08.54,THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE FINDING
898,00:31:09.62,00:31:09.62,ANYTHING WITH IT.
899,00:31:10.50,00:31:10.50,"DUDE, IT DOESN'T SAY CRAP."
900,00:31:16.67,00:31:16.67,>> DID YOU FIND IT?
901,00:31:17.79,00:31:17.79,">> YEAH. >> NO, THE IDOL."
902,00:31:19.25,00:31:19.25,>> HOLD ON. UM...
903,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,>> DO YOU WANT TO JUST BURY IT?
904,00:31:25.12,00:31:25.12,>> LET'S THINK.
905,00:31:25.88,00:31:25.88,"THINK, THINK, THINK."
906,00:31:27.25,00:31:27.25,>> DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT WHERE THE SHOVELS ARE?
907,00:31:28.75,00:31:28.75,DIG A HOLE WITH THE SHOVELS.
908,00:31:30.21,00:31:30.21,>> AND BURY IT.
909,00:31:31.46,00:31:31.46,>> LET'S GO.
910,00:31:34.08,00:31:34.08,>> WHEN GRANT FIRST CAME UP TO
911,00:31:35.33,00:31:35.33,ME I WASN'T SURE IF HE HAD SAW
912,00:31:36.58,00:31:36.58,ME IN THE OTHER WOODS SO I HAD
913,00:31:38.25,00:31:38.25,"TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PRETEND LIKE"
914,00:31:39.46,00:31:39.46,I WAS NERVOUS.
915,00:31:42.46,00:31:42.46,"OKAY, NOBODY WILL KNOW."
916,00:31:43.96,00:31:43.96,>> THIS TREE RIGHT HERE.
917,00:31:45.08,00:31:45.08,>> THIS IS REALLY ALL FOR
918,00:31:46.38,00:31:46.38,NOTHING BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE
919,00:31:47.62,00:31:47.62,"THE IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT IT'S FUN FOR ME."
920,00:31:50.58,00:31:50.58,I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF OUT
921,00:31:51.92,00:31:51.92,HERE SOMEHOW.
922,00:31:54.17,00:31:54.17,"I HAD TO HUSTLE, YOU KNOW, BUT"
923,00:31:55.79,00:31:55.79,YOU GOTTA HUSTLE IF YOU WANT TO
924,00:31:57.79,00:31:57.79,MAKE A DOLLAR.
925,00:31:59.42,00:31:59.42,EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
926,00:32:18.21,00:32:18.21,">> THIS IS THE PUZZLE GUY, HANDS DOWN."
927,00:32:22.29,00:32:22.29,I THINK SHE TRIED HER BEST AND I COMMEND HER FOR IT.
928,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,>> SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE DID A GREAT JOB.
929,00:32:26.17,00:32:26.17,>> THAT JUST WASN'T HER POSITION.
930,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,>> I THINK IN HER DEFENSE
931,00:32:30.29,00:32:30.29,"BECAUSE DAVID IS THE PUZZLE GUY,"
932,00:32:32.29,00:32:32.29,DAVID UNDER PRESSURE IS REALLY STRESSFUL.
933,00:32:36.00,00:32:36.00,>> YOU'RE FREAKING WRONG THERE.
934,00:32:37.12,00:32:37.12,DON'T GO THERE WITH THAT.
935,00:32:38.12,00:32:38.12,ME UNDER PRESSURE MAY NOT BE THE WAY YOU--
936,00:32:40.21,00:32:40.21,>> I'M JUST GIVING YOU MY OPINION.
937,00:32:41.25,00:32:41.25,>> LET ME SPEAK.
938,00:32:42.83,00:32:42.83,"ME UNDER PRESSURE MAY NOT BE THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO BE HANDLED,"
939,00:32:44.58,00:32:44.58,I DON'T FREAK OUT.
940,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,I DO VERY WELL UNDER PRESSURE.
941,00:32:47.21,00:32:47.21,MY ENTIRE LIFE IS BASED ON BEING
942,00:32:48.42,00:32:48.42,UNDER PRESSURE.
943,00:32:49.50,00:32:49.50,>> I'M JUST SAYING--
944,00:32:50.54,00:32:50.54,>> IT JUST DOESN'T JIBE WELL
945,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,WITH YOUR PERSONALITY MAYBE.
946,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,>> I'M JUST SAYING MY
947,00:32:54.79,00:32:54.79,"PERSPECTIVE ON HER, NORMALLY I"
948,00:32:56.21,00:32:56.21,WOULD HAVE DEFAULTED TO YOU--
949,00:32:57.08,00:32:57.08,">> THE PUZZLE MATTERS, NOT THE MAZE."
950,00:32:58.62,00:32:58.62,>> THEN I THINK MAYBE IN THE FUTURE...
951,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,>> I'M THE ONE DOING PUZZLES
952,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,"FROM HERE ON OUT, NO QUESTION."
953,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,>> IT'S ABSURD FOR SERITA TO GO
954,00:33:06.42,00:33:06.42,WITH HER DECISION THAT STEPHANIE
955,00:33:08.42,00:33:08.42,THINKS SHE'S THE RIGHT PERSON.
956,00:33:09.75,00:33:09.75,EVERYBODY KNOWS WE HAVE A VERY
957,00:33:11.42,00:33:11.42,STRONG ATTORNEY.
958,00:33:13.21,00:33:13.21,HE LIVES WITH DOING PUZZLES.
959,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,THAT'S HIS THING.
960,00:33:16.21,00:33:16.21,I'M MORE DISAPPOINTED IN THE
961,00:33:17.29,00:33:17.29,WHOLE TEAM THAN AT STEPHANIE.
962,00:33:19.25,00:33:19.25,FOR A COUPLE OF STRONG
963,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,PERSONALITIES NOT TO STEP UP.
964,00:33:23.96,00:33:23.96,>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- WE'RE
965,00:33:25.04,00:33:25.04,ONE AHEAD AT THIS POINT.
966,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,WE NEED TO STRING A COUPLE OF
967,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,VICTORIES TOGETHER.
968,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,"WE NEED TO BE REALLY, REALLY"
969,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,SMART ABOUT WHO WE PUT WHERE.
970,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,THIS WAS JUST A PERSONNEL PROBLEM.
971,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,>> IT WAS.
972,00:33:34.96,00:33:34.96,>> THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE.
973,00:33:35.96,00:33:35.96,>> STEPHANIE AND KRISTA MADE
974,00:33:37.92,00:33:37.92,"THEIR BED ON DAY ONE, LITERALLY"
975,00:33:39.83,00:33:39.83,"AND METAPHORICALLY, RIGHT NEXT TO RUSSELL."
976,00:33:43.00,00:33:43.00,SO I DON'T SEE EITHER OF THEM AS
977,00:33:45.21,00:33:45.21,SOMEONE I CAN TRUST.
978,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,"YOU KNOW, WITH STEPHANIE'S"
979,00:33:50.71,00:33:50.71,"FLOUNDERING TODAY AT THE PUZZLE,"
980,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,I MIGHT PUT HER AS ON THE
981,00:33:55.38,00:33:55.38,CHOPPING BLOCK NUMBER ONE.
982,00:33:59.75,00:33:59.75,>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
983,00:34:00.92,00:34:00.92,DO YOU THINK STEPHANIE CAN COME
984,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,AROUND OR DO YOU THINK SHE'S
985,00:34:03.08,00:34:03.08,JUST KIND OF PLAYING?
986,00:34:04.25,00:34:04.25,">> NO, I DON'T TRUST HER ONE BIT."
987,00:34:06.46,00:34:06.46,>> I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP HOPES
988,00:34:07.71,00:34:07.71,ON STEPHANIE.
989,00:34:08.75,00:34:08.75,I WANT TO KEEP WORKING ON HER
990,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,BUT KRISTA I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
991,00:34:11.21,00:34:11.21,WASTE MY BREATH.
992,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,I DON'T LIKE HER.
993,00:34:14.12,00:34:14.12,I'M HOPING WE CAN STILL REEL STEPHANIE IN.
994,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50,"THEY BOTH HAVE TARGETS, BUT"
995,00:34:20.75,00:34:20.75,KRISTA HAS THE BULL'S EYE ON HER.
996,00:34:23.46,00:34:23.46,>> HER AND KRISTA AND DAVID ARE
997,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,THE PEOPLE THEY JUST-- EVEN AS
998,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,MUCH AS I WANT TO TRY TO TRUST DAVID.
999,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,>> YEAH.
1000,00:34:30.83,00:34:30.83,>> HE IS A LAWYER AT HIS VERY CORE.
1001,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,HE IS SO OUT FOR HIMSELF.
1002,00:34:34.50,00:34:34.50,">> IF IT WAS ENTIRELY UP TO ME,"
1003,00:34:35.62,00:34:35.62,DAVID WOULD BE GOING HOME
1004,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,TONIGHT BUT STEPHANIE AND
1005,00:34:38.79,00:34:38.79,"KRISTA, THEY PLAYED THEIR HANDS"
1006,00:34:42.25,00:34:42.25,"SO EARLY ON, SO NOW IT'S KIND OF"
1007,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,THEY ARE TWO DEAD DUCKS SITTING
1008,00:34:46.75,00:34:46.75,ON A LAKE WAITING FOR THE GUNSHOTS.
1009,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,">> WELL, I BELIEVE THERE IS A WILL"
1010,00:35:15.29,00:35:15.29,"AND A PLAN, AND IF THAT'S FOR"
1011,00:35:17.58,00:35:17.58,"ONE OF US TONIGHT, IF THERE'S"
1012,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,"NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, THEN"
1013,00:35:20.88,00:35:20.88,ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST
1014,00:35:22.67,00:35:22.67,CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON REDEMPTION
1015,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,ISLAND AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT HERE.
1016,00:35:25.42,00:35:25.42,BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PLAYING THE GAME.
1017,00:35:27.12,00:35:27.12,SO EVENTUALLY THIS IS ALL GOING
1018,00:35:28.54,00:35:28.54,TO COME BACK AND BITE THEM IN THE END.
1019,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,THE SAD THING IS THERE'S--
1020,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,THERE'S REALLY NO SCRAMBLING FOR
1021,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,STEPHANIE AND I TO DO.
1022,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,IT'S EITHER ME OR STEPHANIE GOING HOME.
1023,00:35:43.25,00:35:43.25,THEY'RE SO LOCKED TIGHT IN THEIR
1024,00:35:45.71,00:35:45.71,"COMFORT OF ""LET'S JUST GET"
1025,00:35:47.88,00:35:47.88,THROUGH THIS ONE AND THEN WE
1026,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"KNOW WE'RE SAFE."""
1027,00:35:50.92,00:35:50.92,NO MORE THINKING PAST THE FACT
1028,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF AFTER THIS
1029,00:35:54.04,00:35:54.04,"VOTE, EVERYONE MAKES IT TO THE MERGE?"
1030,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT.
1031,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,AND WHO IS GOING TO STICK AROUND
1032,00:36:00.62,00:36:00.62,IN THE END AND WHO WOULD YOU
1033,00:36:02.21,00:36:02.21,WANT TO BE SITTING NEXT TO WHEN
1034,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33,THE VOTES COME DOWN?
1035,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,"IF I HAD TO PUT MONEY ON IT, I"
1036,00:36:07.75,00:36:07.75,WOULD SAY THAT NONE OF THEM ARE
