224,00:11:22.88,00:11:22.88,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN."
225,00:11:24.42,00:11:24.42,"TONIGHT, LA FLOR,YOU WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL"
226,00:11:27.25,00:11:27.25,"AND VOTE SOMEBODY OUT,THEN LISTEN IN"
227,00:11:30.50,00:11:30.50,"ON ESPADA'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,AND WHILE DOING SO,"
228,00:11:33.25,00:11:33.25,YOU WILL FEASTON CHICKEN AND BEEF KEBOBS.
229,00:11:37.71,00:11:37.71,"LA FLOR, ESPADA, SEE YOUTONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."
230,00:11:40.08,00:11:40.08,"GRAB YOUR STUFF,HEAD BACK TO CAMP."
231,00:11:55.17,00:11:55.17,">> HEY! WINNER, WINNER, WINNER!"
232,00:11:58.21,00:11:58.21,IT'S JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING
233,00:11:59.75,00:11:59.75,TO KNOW THATWE'RE GONNA EAT TONIGHT.
234,00:12:05.42,00:12:05.42,>> ...FOR PICKING METO BE ON THIS TEAM.
235,00:12:07.12,00:12:07.12,">> AWESOME.>> ONE, TWO, THREE..."
236,00:12:09.62,00:12:09.62,>> LA FLOR!
237,00:12:10.92,00:12:10.92,">> THE LITTLE""ONE, TWO, THREE, LA FLOR!"""
238,00:12:13.25,00:12:13.25,THAT WAS TOTALLY FAKE.
239,00:12:14.71,00:12:14.71,"I MEAN, JILL AND MARTY, COME ON."
240,00:12:16.75,00:12:16.75,"YOU COULD SEE THATTHEY'RE WORKING THEIR MINDS,"
241,00:12:18.96,00:12:18.96,THEY'RE WORKINGTHEIR OWN LITTLE THING.
242,00:12:20.46,00:12:20.46,YOU JUST FEEL IT.
243,00:12:21.79,00:12:21.79,BUT WORST-CASE SCENARIOHAPPENED.
244,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,"JILL WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,"
245,00:12:26.25,00:12:26.25,"MARTY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITYIDOL, SO NOW WE'RE STUCK."
246,00:12:29.71,00:12:29.71,BUT WE WILL SOMEHOW VOTESOMEONE OUT THAT WE DON'T WANT.
247,00:12:37.08,00:12:37.08,>> SO WHAT I WAS THINKING--
248,00:12:39.58,00:12:39.58,TELL ME IF YOU WERE THINKINGTHE SAME THING--
249,00:12:42.67,00:12:42.67,"WE SPLIT THE VOTES,THREE VOTES... FOR MARTY"
250,00:12:46.25,00:12:46.25,AND THREE VOTES FOR KELLY B.
251,00:12:48.38,00:12:48.38,"WE TELL KELLY B., THOUGH,"
252,00:12:50.04,00:12:50.04,THAT OUR THREE VOTESARE GOING FOR...
253,00:12:52.00,00:12:52.00,>> JANE. Yep.>> JANE.
254,00:12:53.33,00:12:53.33,>> IT'S JUST THAT EASY.>> THAT EASY.
255,00:12:55.04,00:12:55.04,>> OKAY. COOL.>> COOL.
256,00:12:57.04,00:12:57.04,">> SINCE JILL WONTHE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY TODAY,"
257,00:12:59.75,00:12:59.75,OUR WHOLE STRATEGYKIND OF CHANGES AT THIS POINT.
258,00:13:02.25,00:13:02.25,SO THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS
259,00:13:06.21,00:13:06.21,"WE'LL SPLIT THE VOTEBETWEEN MARTY AND KELLY B.,"
260,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,AND HOPEFULLY FLUSH THE IDOL.
261,00:13:12.17,00:13:12.17,>> COCONUT!>> COCONUT! YAY!
262,00:13:15.29,00:13:15.29,">> I'M EXCITED ABOUTTHE PLAN THAT WE HAVE IN STORE,"
263,00:13:18.67,00:13:18.67,BECAUSE KELLY B. HAS NEVER BEENA PART OF OUR ALLIANCE.
264,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,"YOU KNOW, SHE WAS GUNNINGFOR ME FROM THE START,"
265,00:13:23.38,00:13:23.38,PLUS SHE HAS A FAKE LEG.
266,00:13:25.71,00:13:25.71,SO I THINK PEOPLE WOULD GIVEKELLY B. A MILLION DOLLARS
267,00:13:29.17,00:13:29.17,BECAUSE THEY FEEL BAD FOR HER.
268,00:13:30.88,00:13:30.88,"AND, YOU KNOW,YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE"
269,00:13:32.62,00:13:32.62,SOMEONE LIKE THAT AROUND.
270,00:13:33.96,00:13:33.96,>> SO WE NEED TO SPLITTHREE AND THREE?
271,00:13:37.42,00:13:37.42,">> I MEAN, I LIKE JANE, BUT IFEEL LIKE OUR HAND WAS FORCED."
272,00:13:41.58,00:13:41.58,I REALLY WANTEDTO SEE JANE AROUND HERE
273,00:13:43.42,00:13:43.42,"FOR AS LONGAS WE COULD KEEP HER,"
274,00:13:45.25,00:13:45.25,BUT I'VE BEEN ON THE OUTSWITH THE LA FLOR GROUP
275,00:13:48.04,00:13:48.04,SO THE BEST THING I CAN DOIS JUST KIND OF LAY LOW
276,00:13:51.17,00:13:51.17,AND VOTE WITH EVERYONE ELSE.
277,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,>> YEAH.
278,00:14:00.08,00:14:00.08,"TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCILIS NOT GONNA BE EASY,"
279,00:14:03.12,00:14:03.12,"BECAUSE I HAVE TO, LIKE, MAKESURE ALL THESE PIECES ARE SET."
280,00:14:06.75,00:14:06.75,AND YOU NEVER KNOWWHAT FABIO'S GOING TO DO.
281,00:14:09.62,00:14:09.62,"I MEAN, HE'S CLUELESS,"
282,00:14:11.33,00:14:11.33,SO IT'S GOING TO BEA LITTLE COMPLICATED.
283,00:14:18.58,00:14:18.58,">> DUDE, I HAVE NOTTOLD ANYBODY THIS,"
284,00:14:20.67,00:14:20.67,"NOT EVEN ON MY OWN TRIBE,BUT I AM..."
285,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS.
286,00:14:30.29,00:14:30.29,AND HAVE YOU EVER HEARDOF GUILLERMO VILA BEFORE?
287,00:14:33.21,00:14:33.21,">> NO, MAN, ALL I'VE HEARD OFIS BOBBY FISCHER."
288,00:14:35.54,00:14:35.54,">> OKAY, WELL, GUILLERMO VILASIS AN ARGENTINE GRAND MASTER."
289,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,"WHEN I WAS A KID,I BEAT HIM TWICE."
290,00:14:41.17,00:14:41.17,>> Ha!
291,00:14:42.42,00:14:42.42,">> AND WHEN YOU WANTTO TALK LATER, MAN..."
292,00:14:44.29,00:14:44.29,">> I'M TAKING ORDERS, BRO.>> IF YOU WANT TO..."
293,00:14:46.96,00:14:46.96,IF YOU WANT TO MAKETHE BIGGEST MOVE OF THIS GAME
294,00:14:49.29,00:14:49.29,"EVER IN SURVIVOR, I'VE GOT IT ALL LAID OUT."
295,00:14:52.96,00:14:52.96,"ACTUALLY, I'M NOTA GRAND MASTER IN CHESS."
296,00:14:55.42,00:14:55.42,"AND THE ARGENTINE GRAND MASTEROF ALL TIME, GUILLERMO VILAS,"
297,00:14:59.25,00:14:59.25,HE'S ONE OF THE GREATESTTENNIS PLAYERS OF ALL TIME
298,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,BUT CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO DOWITH CHESS.
299,00:15:04.46,00:15:04.46,SO I COULD PULL ANYTHINGOUT OF THE '70S ON THESE GUYS
300,00:15:07.96,00:15:07.96,AND THEY WOULDN'T KNOWWHAT'S GOING ON.
301,00:15:09.71,00:15:09.71,AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEAUTY IS?
302,00:15:11.42,00:15:11.42,YOU DON'T HAVETO MAKE ANY DECISIONS.
303,00:15:13.75,00:15:13.75,">> WHEN MARTY SAYS,""I AM A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS,"""
304,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,I'M JUST THINKING...
305,00:15:20.29,00:15:20.29,"DUH, LIKE IT MAKES SE...IT DOES MAKE SENSE, MAN."
306,00:15:23.38,00:15:23.38,"HE'S ALWAYS TALKINGABOUT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME,"
307,00:15:25.42,00:15:25.42,"AND YOU CAN SEE HIM DOINGALL THESE NUMBERS IN HIS HEAD,"
308,00:15:28.29,00:15:28.29,"AND I'M, LIKE, SIGN ME UP."
309,00:15:30.71,00:15:30.71,"IT SOUNDS LIKEA GOOD DEAL, YOU KNOW?"
310,00:15:48.46,00:15:48.46,">> YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO COCKY,YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CONFIDENT."
311,00:15:51.58,00:15:51.58,"BUT IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, ITCOULD BE A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME."
312,00:16:05.04,00:16:05.04,>> OH.>> FIRE THIS BABY UP.
313,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,">> I JUST KEPT TOSSINGAND TOSSING AND I WAS, LIKE..."
314,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,">> OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.>> I KNOW."
315,00:16:11.12,00:16:11.12,"FOR ME TO WININDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS GOOD,"
316,00:16:13.29,00:16:13.29,"BUT AT THE SAME POINT,THE OTHER TRIBE GETS TO WATCH"
317,00:16:16.21,00:16:16.21,"OUR TRIBAL COUNCIL,THEY GET TO EAT IN FRONT OF US,"
318,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,SO IT'S NOT GONNA BEA LOT OF FUN.
319,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,I JUST KEPT THINKINGABOUT FOOD AND...
320,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,"FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE,I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,"
321,00:16:27.08,00:16:27.08,AND THE FOUR YOUNGESPADA MEMBERS
322,00:16:30.25,00:16:30.25,DEFINITELY HAVETHE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.
323,00:16:32.71,00:16:32.71,"SO AT THIS POINT,I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO GO"
324,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,"WITH THE MAJORITY,AND THE CHOICES TONIGHT"
325,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,FOR WHO WE CAN VOTE FORARE DAN AND YVE.
326,00:16:43.88,00:16:43.88,SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTSON TONIGHT?
327,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,I'M GETTING EXHAUSTEDWITH THIS STUFF.
328,00:16:53.25,00:16:53.25,IT'S VERY HARDBEING HERE AND LIVING HERE.
329,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,"THE FOOD SITUATION IS BAD,WEATHER SITUATION IS BAD,"
330,00:16:57.96,00:16:57.96,EVERYTHING'S BAD.
331,00:16:59.21,00:16:59.21,AND I DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
332,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,"I GOT A RANGE ROVER,I GOT A FERRARI."
333,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,"I MEAN, WHY IN THE WORLDAM I DOING THIS?"
334,00:17:04.42,00:17:04.42,">> WHEN YOU TALKED TO METHIS MORNING,"
335,00:17:05.96,00:17:05.96,I GUESS I JUST WANT TO KNOW...
336,00:17:07.54,00:17:07.54,>> THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.>> OKAY. YOU CAN'T QUIT.
337,00:17:10.88,00:17:10.88,"I FEEL LIKE DANWANTS TO GIVE UP,"
338,00:17:12.96,00:17:12.96,BUT NOW HE TOLD MEHE DOES NOT WANT TO GO HOME.
339,00:17:16.12,00:17:16.12,"HE NEEDS TO BE HONEST, BECAUSEIF HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE,"
340,00:17:18.83,00:17:18.83,THERE'S PEOPLETHAT WANT TO BE HERE.
341,00:17:23.29,00:17:23.29,>> WHY? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
342,00:17:24.33,00:17:24.33,">> I MEAN, I THINKIT SHOULD BE YVE THAT GOES."
343,00:17:27.42,00:17:27.42,I'D MUCH RATHER GOTO THE MERGE WITH DANNY.
344,00:17:29.62,00:17:29.62,"I PERSONALLY WANTTO GET RID OF YVE TONIGHT,"
345,00:17:32.88,00:17:32.88,BECAUSE I DON'T WANTTO TAKE HER TO THE MERGE.
346,00:17:37.04,00:17:37.04,SHE'S A SMART PLAYER.
347,00:17:38.29,00:17:38.29,SHE'S HERE TO PLAYFOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.
348,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,"DAN, I KNOW FOR A FACT HE'S NOTA THREAT TO ME WHATSOEVER,"
349,00:17:44.33,00:17:44.33,SO IT'S REALLYA NO-BRAINER TONIGHT FOR ME
350,00:17:46.75,00:17:46.75,TO WANT TO VOTE YVE OUT.
351,00:17:48.38,00:17:48.38,"REGARDLESS, US FOUR,IF WE STICK TOGETHER..."
352,00:17:51.38,00:17:51.38,>> FOUR YOUNG.>> YEAH.

357,00:18:01.96,00:18:01.96,"BENRY AND ALINA, I THINKTHEY COULD SWITCH LIKE THAT."
358,00:18:05.25,00:18:05.25,BEST SCENARIO FOR ME TONIGHT?
359,00:18:07.54,00:18:07.54,IT COULD POSSIBLY BETO KEEP YVE.
360,00:18:11.58,00:18:11.58,>> HERE'S WHAT WE'RE FACING.
361,00:18:13.08,00:18:13.08,"IF WE KEEP LOSING,WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS."
362,00:18:16.17,00:18:16.17,"YVE'S KIND OF CLOSE TO ME,SO I THINK SHE WOULD TRUST ME."
363,00:18:20.67,00:18:20.67,"DAN, THE ONLY THING HE COULDBE SWAYED POSSIBLY BY BENRY"
364,00:18:23.79,00:18:23.79,"TO, LIKE, BLIND-SIDE MEOR SOMETHING."
365,00:18:26.29,00:18:26.29,">> CHASE AND I,WE ARE REALLY CONFUSED"
366,00:18:28.62,00:18:28.62,ON WHO WE WOULD WANT OUT.
367,00:18:30.04,00:18:30.04,"IF IT WAS MY CHOICE,I WOULD CHOOSE DAN TO GO HOME,"
368,00:18:32.42,00:18:32.42,BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAYTHAT IF WE CONTINUE KEEPING HIM
369,00:18:34.42,00:18:34.42,"IN THIS GAME, WE'RE GONNA WIN."
370,00:18:36.29,00:18:36.29,DAN'S KNEES ARE ABOUT TO CRACK.
371,00:18:38.88,00:18:38.88,HE'S ABOUT TO START WALKINGON HIS KNEES. (\LAUGHS\)
372,00:18:41.38,00:18:41.38,"SOONER OR LATER, HE'SABOUT TO BE WALKING ON NUBS."
373,00:18:45.83,00:18:45.83,">> HOLLY WON IMMUNITY,AND THE YOUNG TRIBE,"
374,00:18:48.29,00:18:48.29,"THEY'RE PRETTY TIGHT,SO IT'S ME OR DAN."
375,00:18:50.79,00:18:50.79,AND WE'VE BEENTO A LOT OF TRIBALS
376,00:18:53.00,00:18:53.00,"WHEN DAN'S NAME GETS WRITTENDOWN, BUT HE'S NOT VOTED OUT."
377,00:18:56.29,00:18:56.29,MAYBE HE'S JUST GOT A LITTLESOMEONE SITTING ON HIS SHOULDER
378,00:18:59.50,00:18:59.50,WATCHING OUT FOR HIMTHAT I'M HOPING JUMPS SHIP
379,00:19:01.75,00:19:01.75,AND COMES OVERTO MY SHOULDER TONIGHT.
380,00:19:03.42,00:19:03.42,">> I HAVE TO TELL YOU GIRLS,I SURE AS HELL"
381,00:19:05.83,00:19:05.83,"DON'T WANT TO GO HOME, AND I'MHERE COMMITTED 100% OF THE TIME."
382,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,">> WELL, AT THIS POINT,IT'S STILL A TRIBE GAME,"
383,00:19:11.17,00:19:11.17,"SO OBVIOUSLY,WE NEED STRONG PEOPLE."
384,00:19:14.42,00:19:14.42,I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE DAN.
385,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,">> HOLLY SAID THIS MORNINGHE SAID ""I'M DONE."""
