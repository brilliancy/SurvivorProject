83,00:04:29.12,00:04:29.12,A VERY BAD HAND BY COMING ON TO A TEAM IN MINORITY NUMBERS.
84,00:04:32.88,00:04:32.88,I FEEL LIKE THE YOUNG ONES BONDED AND BONDED REALLY STRONG.

199,00:10:12.83,00:10:12.83,CONGRATULATIONS.
200,00:10:13.96,00:10:13.96,>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
201,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,>> Jeff: JILL IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
202,00:10:17.96,00:10:17.96,"JILL, YOU WILL TAKE ON HOLLY FOR A TRIBAL FEAST."
203,00:10:20.58,00:10:20.58,LET'S MOVE.
204,00:10:26.25,00:10:26.25,HERE WE GO.
205,00:10:27.50,00:10:27.50,FIRST TO LAND ALL THREE RINGS ON A HOOK
206,00:10:30.17,00:10:30.17,WINS FEAST FOR THEIR TRIBE.
207,00:10:33.12,00:10:33.12,SURVIVORS READY?
208,00:10:36.46,00:10:36.46,GO.
209,00:10:40.38,00:10:40.38,TWO PEOPLE FROM THE ORIGINAL OLDER TRIBE
210,00:10:42.96,00:10:42.96,SQUARING OFF IN THIS CHALLENGE.
211,00:10:44.71,00:10:44.71,>> SLOW IT DOWN! >> Jeff: JILL AND HOLLY.
212,00:10:47.92,00:10:47.92,>> YES!
213,00:10:48.96,00:10:48.96,>> Jeff: HOLLY LANDS HER FIRST RING.
214,00:10:50.17,00:10:50.17,">> JILL, YOU'VE GOT IT. TAKE YOUR TIME."
215,00:10:52.25,00:10:52.25,>> GET IN THE ZONE!
216,00:10:54.12,00:10:54.12,>> NICE!
217,00:10:55.62,00:10:55.62,">> Jeff: JILL LANDS HER FIRST RING, AND THE SECOND RING."
218,00:10:59.21,00:10:59.21,JILL AND HOLLY BOTH WITH TWO!
219,00:11:01.25,00:11:01.25,ONE RING LEFT.
220,00:11:03.04,00:11:03.04,JILL OR HOLLY CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.
221,00:11:06.38,00:11:06.38,">> GO, JILL!"
222,00:11:07.96,00:11:07.96,>> Jeff: HOLLY JUST MISSES.
223,00:11:12.75,00:11:12.75,JILL WINS FEAST FOR LA FLOR!
224,00:11:21.29,00:11:21.29,>> WE'RE GONNA EAT!
225,00:11:22.88,00:11:22.88,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN."
226,00:11:24.42,00:11:24.42,"TONIGHT, LA FLOR, YOU WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL"
227,00:11:27.25,00:11:27.25,"AND VOTE SOMEBODY OUT, THEN LISTEN IN"
228,00:11:30.50,00:11:30.50,"ON ESPADA'S TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND WHILE DOING SO,"
229,00:11:33.25,00:11:33.25,YOU WILL FEAST ON CHICKEN AND BEEF KEBOBS.
230,00:11:37.71,00:11:37.71,"LA FLOR, ESPADA, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."
231,00:11:40.08,00:11:40.08,"GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP."
232,00:11:55.17,00:11:55.17,">> HEY! WINNER, WINNER, WINNER!"
233,00:11:58.21,00:11:58.21,IT'S JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING
234,00:11:59.75,00:11:59.75,TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA EAT TONIGHT.
235,00:12:05.42,00:12:05.42,>> ...FOR PICKING ME TO BE ON THIS TEAM.
236,00:12:07.12,00:12:07.12,">> AWESOME. >> ONE, TWO, THREE..."
237,00:12:09.62,00:12:09.62,>> LA FLOR!
238,00:12:10.92,00:12:10.92,">> THE LITTLE ""ONE, TWO, THREE, LA FLOR!"""
239,00:12:13.25,00:12:13.25,THAT WAS TOTALLY FAKE.
240,00:12:14.71,00:12:14.71,"I MEAN, JILL AND MARTY, COME ON."
241,00:12:16.75,00:12:16.75,"YOU COULD SEE THAT THEY'RE WORKING THEIR MINDS,"
242,00:12:18.96,00:12:18.96,THEY'RE WORKING THEIR OWN LITTLE THING.
243,00:12:20.46,00:12:20.46,YOU JUST FEEL IT.
244,00:12:21.79,00:12:21.79,BUT WORST-CASE SCENARIO HAPPENED.
245,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,"JILL WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,"
246,00:12:26.25,00:12:26.25,"MARTY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, SO NOW WE'RE STUCK."
247,00:12:29.71,00:12:29.71,BUT WE WILL SOMEHOW VOTE SOMEONE OUT THAT WE DON'T WANT.
248,00:12:37.08,00:12:37.08,>> SO WHAT I WAS THINKING--
249,00:12:39.58,00:12:39.58,TELL ME IF YOU WERE THINKING THE SAME THING--
250,00:12:42.67,00:12:42.67,"WE SPLIT THE VOTES, THREE VOTES... FOR MARTY"
251,00:12:46.25,00:12:46.25,AND THREE VOTES FOR KELLY B.
252,00:12:48.38,00:12:48.38,"WE TELL KELLY B., THOUGH,"
253,00:12:50.04,00:12:50.04,THAT OUR THREE VOTES ARE GOING FOR...
254,00:12:52.00,00:12:52.00,>> JANE. Yep. >> JANE.
255,00:12:53.33,00:12:53.33,>> IT'S JUST THAT EASY. >> THAT EASY.
256,00:12:55.04,00:12:55.04,>> OKAY. COOL. >> COOL.
257,00:12:57.04,00:12:57.04,">> SINCE JILL WON THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY TODAY,"
258,00:12:59.75,00:12:59.75,OUR WHOLE STRATEGY KIND OF CHANGES AT THIS POINT.
259,00:13:02.25,00:13:02.25,SO THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS
260,00:13:06.21,00:13:06.21,"WE'LL SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN MARTY AND KELLY B.,"
261,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,AND HOPEFULLY FLUSH THE IDOL.
262,00:13:12.17,00:13:12.17,>> COCONUT! >> COCONUT! YAY!
263,00:13:15.29,00:13:15.29,">> I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE IN STORE,"
264,00:13:18.67,00:13:18.67,BECAUSE KELLY B. HAS NEVER BEEN A PART OF OUR ALLIANCE.
265,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,"YOU KNOW, SHE WAS GUNNING FOR ME FROM THE START,"
266,00:13:23.38,00:13:23.38,PLUS SHE HAS A FAKE LEG.
267,00:13:25.71,00:13:25.71,SO I THINK PEOPLE WOULD GIVE KELLY B. A MILLION DOLLARS
268,00:13:29.17,00:13:29.17,BECAUSE THEY FEEL BAD FOR HER.
269,00:13:30.88,00:13:30.88,"AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE"
270,00:13:32.62,00:13:32.62,SOMEONE LIKE THAT AROUND.
271,00:13:33.96,00:13:33.96,>> SO WE NEED TO SPLIT THREE AND THREE?
272,00:13:37.42,00:13:37.42,">> I MEAN, I LIKE JANE, BUT I FEEL LIKE OUR HAND WAS FORCED."
273,00:13:41.58,00:13:41.58,I REALLY WANTED TO SEE JANE AROUND HERE
274,00:13:43.42,00:13:43.42,"FOR AS LONG AS WE COULD KEEP HER,"
275,00:13:45.25,00:13:45.25,BUT I'VE BEEN ON THE OUTS WITH THE LA FLOR GROUP
276,00:13:48.04,00:13:48.04,SO THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS JUST KIND OF LAY LOW
277,00:13:51.17,00:13:51.17,AND VOTE WITH EVERYONE ELSE.
278,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,>> YEAH.
279,00:14:00.08,00:14:00.08,"TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL IS NOT GONNA BE EASY,"
280,00:14:03.12,00:14:03.12,"BECAUSE I HAVE TO, LIKE, MAKE SURE ALL THESE PIECES ARE SET."
281,00:14:06.75,00:14:06.75,AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT FABIO'S GOING TO DO.
282,00:14:09.62,00:14:09.62,"I MEAN, HE'S CLUELESS,"
283,00:14:11.33,00:14:11.33,SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
284,00:14:18.58,00:14:18.58,">> DUDE, I HAVE NOT TOLD ANYBODY THIS,"
285,00:14:20.67,00:14:20.67,"NOT EVEN ON MY OWN TRIBE, BUT I AM..."
286,00:14:25.71,00:14:25.71,A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS.
287,00:14:30.29,00:14:30.29,AND HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF GUILLERMO VILA BEFORE?
288,00:14:33.21,00:14:33.21,">> NO, MAN, ALL I'VE HEARD OF IS BOBBY FISCHER."
289,00:14:35.54,00:14:35.54,">> OKAY, WELL, GUILLERMO VILAS IS AN ARGENTINE GRAND MASTER."
290,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,"WHEN I WAS A KID, I BEAT HIM TWICE."
291,00:14:41.17,00:14:41.17,>> Ha!
292,00:14:42.42,00:14:42.42,">> AND WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK LATER, MAN..."
293,00:14:44.29,00:14:44.29,">> I'M TAKING ORDERS, BRO. >> IF YOU WANT TO..."
294,00:14:46.96,00:14:46.96,IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE BIGGEST MOVE OF THIS GAME
295,00:14:49.29,00:14:49.29,"EVER IN SURVIVOR,  I'VE GOT IT ALL LAID OUT."
296,00:14:52.96,00:14:52.96,"ACTUALLY, I'M NOT A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS."
297,00:14:55.42,00:14:55.42,"AND THE ARGENTINE GRAND MASTER OF ALL TIME, GUILLERMO VILAS,"
298,00:14:59.25,00:14:59.25,HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST TENNIS PLAYERS OF ALL TIME
299,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,BUT CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CHESS.
300,00:15:04.46,00:15:04.46,SO I COULD PULL ANYTHING OUT OF THE '70S ON THESE GUYS
301,00:15:07.96,00:15:07.96,AND THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
302,00:15:09.71,00:15:09.71,AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEAUTY IS?
303,00:15:11.42,00:15:11.42,YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY DECISIONS.
304,00:15:13.75,00:15:13.75,">> WHEN MARTY SAYS, ""I AM A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS,"""
305,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,I'M JUST THINKING...
306,00:15:20.29,00:15:20.29,"DUH, LIKE IT MAKES SE... IT DOES MAKE SENSE, MAN."
307,00:15:23.38,00:15:23.38,"HE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME,"
308,00:15:25.42,00:15:25.42,"AND YOU CAN SEE HIM DOING ALL THESE NUMBERS IN HIS HEAD,"
309,00:15:28.29,00:15:28.29,"AND I'M, LIKE, SIGN ME UP."
310,00:15:30.71,00:15:30.71,"IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL, YOU KNOW?"
311,00:15:48.46,00:15:48.46,">> YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO COCKY, YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CONFIDENT."
312,00:15:51.58,00:15:51.58,"BUT IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, IT COULD BE A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME."
313,00:16:05.04,00:16:05.04,>> OH. >> FIRE THIS BABY UP.
314,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,">> I JUST KEPT TOSSING AND TOSSING AND I WAS, LIKE..."
315,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,">> OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. >> I KNOW."
316,00:16:11.12,00:16:11.12,"FOR ME TO WIN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS GOOD,"
317,00:16:13.29,00:16:13.29,"BUT AT THE SAME POINT, THE OTHER TRIBE GETS TO WATCH"
318,00:16:16.21,00:16:16.21,"OUR TRIBAL COUNCIL, THEY GET TO EAT IN FRONT OF US,"
319,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN.
320,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,I JUST KEPT THINKING ABOUT FOOD AND...
321,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,"FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE, I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,"
322,00:16:27.08,00:16:27.08,AND THE FOUR YOUNG ESPADA MEMBERS
323,00:16:30.25,00:16:30.25,DEFINITELY HAVE THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.
324,00:16:32.71,00:16:32.71,"SO AT THIS POINT, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO GO"
325,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,"WITH THE MAJORITY, AND THE CHOICES TONIGHT"
326,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,FOR WHO WE CAN VOTE FOR ARE DAN AND YVE.
327,00:16:43.88,00:16:43.88,SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TONIGHT?
328,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,I'M GETTING EXHAUSTED WITH THIS STUFF.
329,00:16:53.25,00:16:53.25,IT'S VERY HARD BEING HERE AND LIVING HERE.
330,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,"THE FOOD SITUATION IS BAD, WEATHER SITUATION IS BAD,"
331,00:16:57.96,00:16:57.96,EVERYTHING'S BAD.
332,00:16:59.21,00:16:59.21,AND I DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
333,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,"I GOT A RANGE ROVER, I GOT A FERRARI."
334,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,"I MEAN, WHY IN THE WORLD AM I DOING THIS?"
335,00:17:04.42,00:17:04.42,">> WHEN YOU TALKED TO ME THIS MORNING,"
336,00:17:05.96,00:17:05.96,I GUESS I JUST WANT TO KNOW...
337,00:17:07.54,00:17:07.54,>> THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. >> OKAY. YOU CAN'T QUIT.
338,00:17:10.88,00:17:10.88,"I FEEL LIKE DAN WANTS TO GIVE UP,"
339,00:17:12.96,00:17:12.96,BUT NOW HE TOLD ME HE DOES NOT WANT TO GO HOME.
340,00:17:16.12,00:17:16.12,"HE NEEDS TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE,"
341,00:17:18.83,00:17:18.83,THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE HERE.
342,00:17:23.29,00:17:23.29,>> WHY? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
343,00:17:24.33,00:17:24.33,">> I MEAN, I THINK IT SHOULD BE YVE THAT GOES."
344,00:17:27.42,00:17:27.42,I'D MUCH RATHER GO TO THE MERGE WITH DANNY.
345,00:17:29.62,00:17:29.62,"I PERSONALLY WANT TO GET RID OF YVE TONIGHT,"
346,00:17:32.88,00:17:32.88,BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HER TO THE MERGE.
347,00:17:37.04,00:17:37.04,SHE'S A SMART PLAYER.
348,00:17:38.29,00:17:38.29,SHE'S HERE TO PLAY FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.
349,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,"DAN, I KNOW FOR A FACT HE'S NOT A THREAT TO ME WHATSOEVER,"
350,00:17:44.33,00:17:44.33,SO IT'S REALLY A NO-BRAINER TONIGHT FOR ME
351,00:17:46.75,00:17:46.75,TO WANT TO VOTE YVE OUT.
352,00:17:48.38,00:17:48.38,"REGARDLESS, US FOUR, IF WE STICK TOGETHER..."
353,00:17:51.38,00:17:51.38,>> FOUR YOUNG. >> YEAH.
354,00:17:52.75,00:17:52.75,>> I KNOW. >> WE'RE SET.
355,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,>> I KNOW. >> THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN
356,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,"THE FOUR ORIGINAL LA FLOR GUYS IS WE SAY WE TRUST EACH OTHER,"
357,00:17:59.50,00:17:59.50,THE ONLY ONE I REALLY TRULY TRUST IS NAONKA.
358,00:18:01.96,00:18:01.96,"BENRY AND ALINA, I THINK THEY COULD SWITCH LIKE THAT."
359,00:18:05.25,00:18:05.25,BEST SCENARIO FOR ME TONIGHT?
360,00:18:07.54,00:18:07.54,IT COULD POSSIBLY BE TO KEEP YVE.
361,00:18:11.58,00:18:11.58,>> HERE'S WHAT WE'RE FACING.
362,00:18:13.08,00:18:13.08,"IF WE KEEP LOSING, WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS."
363,00:18:16.17,00:18:16.17,"YVE'S KIND OF CLOSE TO ME, SO I THINK SHE WOULD TRUST ME."
364,00:18:20.67,00:18:20.67,"DAN, THE ONLY THING HE COULD BE SWAYED POSSIBLY BY BENRY"
365,00:18:23.79,00:18:23.79,"TO, LIKE, BLIND-SIDE ME OR SOMETHING."
366,00:18:26.29,00:18:26.29,">> CHASE AND I, WE ARE REALLY CONFUSED"
367,00:18:28.62,00:18:28.62,ON WHO WE WOULD WANT OUT.
368,00:18:30.04,00:18:30.04,"IF IT WAS MY CHOICE, I WOULD CHOOSE DAN TO GO HOME,"
369,00:18:32.42,00:18:32.42,BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT IF WE CONTINUE KEEPING HIM
370,00:18:34.42,00:18:34.42,"IN THIS GAME, WE'RE GONNA WIN."
371,00:18:36.29,00:18:36.29,DAN'S KNEES ARE ABOUT TO CRACK.
372,00:18:38.88,00:18:38.88,HE'S ABOUT TO START WALKING ON HIS KNEES. (\\LAUGHS\\)
373,00:18:41.38,00:18:41.38,"SOONER OR LATER, HE'S ABOUT TO BE WALKING ON NUBS."
374,00:18:45.83,00:18:45.83,">> HOLLY WON IMMUNITY, AND THE YOUNG TRIBE,"
375,00:18:48.29,00:18:48.29,"THEY'RE PRETTY TIGHT, SO IT'S ME OR DAN."
376,00:18:50.79,00:18:50.79,AND WE'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF TRIBALS
377,00:18:53.00,00:18:53.00,"WHEN DAN'S NAME GETS WRITTEN DOWN, BUT HE'S NOT VOTED OUT."
378,00:18:56.29,00:18:56.29,MAYBE HE'S JUST GOT A LITTLE SOMEONE SITTING ON HIS SHOULDER
379,00:18:59.50,00:18:59.50,WATCHING OUT FOR HIM THAT I'M HOPING JUMPS SHIP
380,00:19:01.75,00:19:01.75,AND COMES OVER TO MY SHOULDER TONIGHT.
381,00:19:03.42,00:19:03.42,">> I HAVE TO TELL YOU GIRLS, I SURE AS HELL"
382,00:19:05.83,00:19:05.83,"DON'T WANT TO GO HOME, AND I'M HERE COMMITTED 100% OF THE TIME."
383,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,">> WELL, AT THIS POINT, IT'S STILL A TRIBE GAME,"
384,00:19:11.17,00:19:11.17,"SO OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED STRONG PEOPLE."
385,00:19:14.42,00:19:14.42,I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE DAN.
386,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,">> HOLLY SAID THIS MORNING HE SAID ""I'M DONE."""
387,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,AND I'M NOT HERE TO QUIT HALFWAY.
388,00:19:20.46,00:19:20.46,"AND OUT OF THE THREE OF US, WHEN WE DO MERGE,"
389,00:19:23.29,00:19:23.29,I KNOW ALL THREE OF THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE
390,00:19:25.71,00:19:25.71,MORE INTIMATELY THAN THEY DO.
391,00:19:28.21,00:19:28.21,WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY BENEFIT YOU TWO... (\\INDISTINCT\\)
392,00:19:32.71,00:19:32.71,"SO ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT, OKAY?"
393,00:19:34.75,00:19:34.75,">> NO, I THINK WE WERE ALREADY ON THE SAME PAGE."
394,00:19:37.04,00:19:37.04,>> ALL RIGHT.
395,00:19:38.25,00:19:38.25,">> YVE CAME UP TO ME AND NAONKA AND SHE SAID,"
396,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,"""I'M ACTUALLY VALUABLE TO YOU GUYS"
397,00:19:41.62,00:19:41.62,"""BECAUSE WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE,"
398,00:19:43.25,00:19:43.25,"I HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OLD ESPADA TRIBE."""
399,00:19:45.25,00:19:45.25,"AND I'M THINKING, IF WE GET YOU TO THE MERGE"
400,00:19:47.33,00:19:47.33,"AND YOU HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS,"
401,00:19:48.88,00:19:48.88,WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SWITCH ON US?
402,00:19:51.17,00:19:51.17,"CLEARLY, DAN ISN'T STRONG PHYSICALLY."
403,00:19:53.96,00:19:53.96,BUT THE PROBLEM WITH YVE IS THAT YVE IS PLAYING REALLY HARD.
404,00:19:56.67,00:19:56.67,"SO IN MY HEAD I WENT, WOW, THAT'S THE PERFECT ARGUMENT"
405,00:19:59.12,00:19:59.12,TO GET RID OF HER.
406,00:20:19.17,00:20:19.17,>> 100%. >> OKAY.
407,00:20:30.79,00:20:30.79,>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS MOST IMPORTANT
408,00:20:32.46,00:20:32.46,"TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG PHYSICALLY,"
409,00:20:34.29,00:20:34.29,"BUT, THEN, AT THE SAME TIME,"
410,00:20:35.88,00:20:35.88,I THINK THAT YVE MIGHT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
411,00:20:37.75,00:20:37.75,"TO GET HERSELF, YOU KNOW, FURTHER IN THE GAME."
412,00:20:40.08,00:20:40.08,SO SHE COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.
413,00:20:42.25,00:20:42.25,JUST NEED TO BE SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO.
414,00:20:45.25,00:20:45.25,>> YOU GUYS GOT TO TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.
415,00:20:47.50,00:20:47.50,"I MEAN, THIS IS GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE."
416,00:20:49.38,00:20:49.38,">> DO NOT FOLLOW YOUR HEART, FOLLOW YOUR GUT."
417,00:20:51.88,00:20:51.88,"IT WOULD BE DAN, BECAUSE WHAT IF WE HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE"
418,00:20:54.38,00:20:54.38,THAT'S SUPER PHYSICAL AND HIS KNEES HURT?
419,00:20:56.62,00:20:56.62,THEN WHAT?
420,00:20:58.21,00:20:58.21,FIRST CHASE WANTED TO VOTE FOR DAN.
421,00:21:00.88,00:21:00.88,NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE CHASE WANTS YVE TAKEN OUT.
422,00:21:03.08,00:21:03.08,"OKAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS WANT TO DO, TELL ME."
423,00:21:05.67,00:21:05.67,"TELL ME RIGHT NOW, IS THAT WHAT YOU GUYS WANT ME TO DO,"
424,00:21:08.33,00:21:08.33,BECAUSE I'LL RIGHT HER NAME DOWN AND I'LL SMILE IN HER FACE.
425,00:21:10.92,00:21:10.92,THAT'S OUT-WIN.
426,00:21:23.08,00:21:23.08,>> YEAH. >> YEAH.
427,00:21:26.96,00:21:26.96,>> YEAH.
428,00:21:35.83,00:21:35.83,"I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD HAVE GUESSED IT,"
429,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,BUT WE ALWAYS WANTED TO GET MARTY.
430,00:21:43.25,00:21:43.25,>> RIGHT.
431,00:21:44.50,00:21:44.50,>> THEY'VE BEEN MY ENEMIES FROM DAY ONE.
432,00:21:49.79,00:21:49.79,"I'LL DO WHATEVER Y'ALL WANT ME TO DO, HONEY."
433,00:21:52.29,00:21:52.29,I'M AS THICK AS PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY
434,00:21:54.58,00:21:54.58,"WITH THE YOUNGER LA FLOR TRIBE,"
435,00:21:57.12,00:21:57.12,SO I HAVE A LITTLE SMILE ON MY FACE
436,00:21:59.25,00:21:59.25,"'CAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND,"
437,00:22:02.08,00:22:02.08,BECAUSE THOSE TWO NEVER PULLED ME INTO THEIR ALLIANCE.
438,00:22:06.79,00:22:06.79,THEY'VE BEEN CONNIVING SINCE DAY ONE.
439,00:22:09.38,00:22:09.38,SO I HOPE IT GOES THE WAY BRENDA'S PLANNED IT.
440,00:22:20.12,00:22:20.12,>> NO.
441,00:22:21.46,00:22:21.46,">> WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS,"
442,00:22:22.92,00:22:22.92,WE GOT TO FLUSH THE IDOL AWAY FROM MARTY.
443,00:22:26.75,00:22:26.75,SO WE'RE THINKING THAT WE SPLIT THE VOTES.
444,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,THREE VOTES FOR MARTY...
445,00:22:32.38,00:22:32.38,AND THREE VOTES FOR KELLY B.
446,00:22:36.21,00:22:36.21,>> DO WE WANT TO FLUSH THE IDOL FROM MARTY?
447,00:22:38.54,00:22:38.54,>> WHY NOT?
448,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,"I MEAN, IT'S DANGEROUS TO HAVE HIM HOLD ON TO IT."
449,00:22:42.33,00:22:42.33,"MARTY'S A SMART GUY, HE'S GOING TO USE HIS IDOL TONIGHT, OKAY?"
450,00:22:45.88,00:22:45.88,">> I DON'T KNOW. >> HE WILL, TRUST ME."
451,00:22:47.96,00:22:47.96,IF YOU VOTE FOR MARTY...
452,00:22:49.12,00:22:49.12,">> I DON'T... MAN, I LIKE MARTY."
453,00:22:52.54,00:22:52.54,"SASH WANTS ME TO VOTE FOR MARTY,"
454,00:22:54.62,00:22:54.62,BUT I WANT MARTY TO STICK AROUND.
455,00:22:57.38,00:22:57.38,"HE'S A SMART GUY,"
456,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,"HE'S LET ME IN ON SOME OF HIS SECRETS, YOU KNOW?"
457,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,SO I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF IN GOOD WITH HIM.
458,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,>> IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS FOR HIM TO HOLD ON
459,00:23:07.00,00:23:07.00,TO THAT IMMUNITY IDOL UNTIL WHENEVER HE WANTS TO USE IT.
460,00:23:10.29,00:23:10.29,"IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN,"
461,00:23:12.21,00:23:12.21,WE'LL BE ABLE TO KILL A COUPLE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.
462,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,"BUT FABIO IS SO UP IN THE AIR ALL THE TIME,"
463,00:23:18.08,00:23:18.08,WHO KNOWS WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING
464,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,"THIS EVENING, SO SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG."
465,00:23:29.25,00:23:29.25,>> I REALLY WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME.
466,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,ANYTHING I CAN DO.
467,00:23:33.62,00:23:33.62,I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.
468,00:23:40.75,00:23:40.75,"I MEAN, ARE YOU..."
469,00:23:45.04,00:23:45.04,">> HEY, MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GAME'S ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW?"
470,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME GOING HOME
471,00:23:48.96,00:23:48.96,AND YOU GUYS ARE STRAIGHT UP AND REALLY HONEST
472,00:23:50.75,00:23:50.75,"ABOUT THAT'S THE WAY THE CHIPS ARE GOING TO FALL,"
473,00:23:52.75,00:23:52.75,"YOU KNOW, THEN I'M GOOD WITH THAT."
474,00:23:54.83,00:23:54.83,>> OKAY.
475,00:23:56.17,00:23:56.17,">> I THOUGHT WITH FABIO WE COULD MAYBE SHAKE THINGS UP,"
476,00:23:58.79,00:23:58.79,"BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TOO DICEY,"
477,00:24:00.62,00:24:00.62,IT'S PROBABLY SAFER TO GO WITH JANE TONIGHT.
478,00:24:04.08,00:24:04.08,BUYS US A LITTLE TIME.
479,00:24:11.75,00:24:11.75,>> THE VOTE WILL BE DETERMINED
480,00:24:13.12,00:24:13.12,BY WHAT MARTY DOES WITH THE IDOL.
481,00:24:15.83,00:24:15.83,"IF HE PLAYS THE IDOL, KELLY B.'S GOING HOME."
482,00:24:19.00,00:24:19.00,"IF MARTY DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL, IT WILL BE A TIE."
483,00:24:22.33,00:24:22.33,"AND WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A TOUGH DECISION,"
484,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,"BECAUSE MARTY IS THE NUMBER-ONE ENEMY RIGHT NOW,"
485,00:24:28.08,00:24:28.08,BECAUSE HE'S A HUGE SCHEMER.
486,00:24:29.83,00:24:29.83,"BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KEEP"
487,00:24:32.58,00:24:32.58,A PISSED-OFF KELLY B. WHO CAN WIN THE WHOLE THING?
488,00:24:36.04,00:24:36.04,SO ENEMY; KELLY B.
489,00:24:39.67,00:24:39.67,I DON'T KNOW.
490,00:24:42.71,00:24:42.71,">> UH, FABIO DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE"
491,00:24:44.67,00:24:44.67,PUTTING HIS VOTE FOR MARTY.
492,00:24:55.38,00:24:55.38,"IT'S A VERY, VERY CALCULATED DECISION"
493,00:24:58.29,00:24:58.29,TO PLAY OR NOT PLAY THE IDOL.
494,00:25:00.25,00:25:00.25,"MY GUT IS TELLING ME THEY WILL VOTE FOR JANE,"
495,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,SO I'LL HANG ON TO IT.
496,00:25:04.67,00:25:04.67,IT WOULD ONLY BUY ME ONE MORE TRIBAL COUNCIL ANYWAYS.
497,00:25:07.12,00:25:07.12,BUT IT COULD VERY WELL BE ME GOING HOME TONIGHT
498,00:25:09.96,00:25:09.96,IF I MAKE THE WRONG DECISION.
499,00:25:33.75,00:25:33.75,">> Jeff: MARTY, OBVIOUS DISPARITY."

502,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE YOU DON'T MAYBE FIT IN.
503,00:25:43.29,00:25:43.29,">> YEAH, THINGS CHANGED RADICALLY."
504,00:25:44.92,00:25:44.92,YOU'RE IN ONE POSITION ONE DAY
505,00:25:46.17,00:25:46.17,"AND... JUST LIKE THAT, IT ALL CHANGES."
506,00:25:48.29,00:25:48.29,"SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS, THIS TRIBE IS ALL ABOUT WINNING,"
507,00:25:50.96,00:25:50.96,SO IF YOU CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THAT
508,00:25:52.33,00:25:52.33,"AND DO YOUR WORK AROUND CAMP, I THINK, YOU KNOW,"
509,00:25:54.33,00:25:54.33,THINGS HOPEFULLY GO YOUR WAY.
510,00:25:56.25,00:25:56.25,">> Jeff: SASH, ON DAY ONE OF THIS NEW TRIBE,"
511,00:25:58.67,00:25:58.67,WHAT DID MARTY DO TO TRY TO MAKE HIMSELF WORTHY?
512,00:26:01.79,00:26:01.79,">> VERY FIRST DAY, MARTY KIND OF CALLED A MEETING"
513,00:26:05.21,00:26:05.21,TO NOT ONLY INTRODUCE HIMSELF BUT HE ALSO MENTIONED TO US
514,00:26:09.29,00:26:09.29,THAT HE WAS HOLDING ON TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
515,00:26:12.29,00:26:12.29,">> Jeff: SO, MARTY, YOU TOLD EVERYBODY"
516,00:26:14.21,00:26:14.21,THAT YOU HAD A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL?
517,00:26:16.29,00:26:16.29,">> YEAH, I MEAN, I THOUGHT TO GET OFF ON THE BEST START"
518,00:26:19.58,00:26:19.58,THAT I COULD WITH THIS TRIBE WAS TO COME CLEAN
519,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,"AND LET THEM KNOW, HEY, LISTEN, I HAVE THE IDOL,"
520,00:26:23.54,00:26:23.54,"I'M GOING TO HANG IT RIGHT OUT ON THE TREE,"
521,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,"AND BY DOING SO, HOPEFULLY IT BOUGHT ME SOME GOODWILL"
522,00:26:28.08,00:26:28.08,"AND SHOWED THEM WHAT KIND OF GAME I'VE BEEN PLAYING,"
523,00:26:30.17,00:26:30.17,"WHICH HAS BEEN A REALLY, REALLY STRAIGHT GAME FROM DAY ONE."
524,00:26:32.79,00:26:32.79,">> Jeff: BRENDA, ON ONE HAND, THIS IS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL,"

528,00:26:41.67,00:26:41.67,AND SO I FEEL LIKE MAYBE IS HE TRYING
529,00:26:43.83,00:26:43.83,TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE NOBLE THAN IT REALLY IS.
530,00:26:47.54,00:26:47.54,">> Jeff: SO, MARTY, NOW YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT,"
531,00:26:49.71,00:26:49.71,"ARE THEY GOING TO GUN FOR ME AND TRY TO GET ME TO PLAY IT,"

533,00:26:55.50,00:26:55.50,AND GET RID OF ME AND THE IDOL IN ONE FELL SWOOP?
534,00:26:57.79,00:26:57.79,">> YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK"
535,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,"I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT, JUST A WEE BIT,"
536,00:27:02.12,00:27:02.12,OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS?

550,00:27:32.50,00:27:32.50,SO I WOULDN'T TRUST TOO MANY PEOPLE.

552,00:27:37.75,00:27:37.75,">> I MEAN, FOR ANYONE HERE."
553,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,"BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR OWN INTENTIONS."

562,00:28:02.58,00:28:02.58,>> NO. SHE HAS TO WORRY FOR JILL AND MARTY VOTING HER OUT.
563,00:28:09.33,00:28:09.33,THAT'S THE TRUTH.
564,00:28:11.00,00:28:11.00,>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
565,00:28:12.88,00:28:12.88,">> COME ON, MARTY."

573,00:28:29.96,00:28:29.96,YOU SAID WHAT SHE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT.
574,00:28:31.50,00:28:31.50,WHAT SHE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT ARE NUMBERS.
575,00:28:33.62,00:28:33.62,THESE TWO NUMBERS HERE DON'T ADD UP TO A LOT.
