271,00:15:02.00,00:15:02.00,>> Nobody would vote against himin the final two.

283,00:15:40.07,00:15:40.07,"and, lucky for me, that allianceis breaking down now."
284,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,I'm not sure exactly what'sgoing to happen.
285,00:15:45.47,00:15:45.47,The only thing I can do isto keep close to Tom and Ian.
286,00:15:48.23,00:15:48.23,That's all I can do.That's my only hope.
287,00:15:58.93,00:15:58.93,">> Gregg, you got to go onfirst."
288,00:16:00.67,00:16:00.67,">> This is awesome.>> Oh, my God."

295,00:16:20.83,00:16:20.83,We were so excited to get onto the next event.
296,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,"So we quickly scrubbed up, threwthe bathrobe on and then we went"
297,00:16:27.23,00:16:27.23,up to the deck for full-bodymassages.
298,00:16:30.03,00:16:30.03,It felt like finally I was onvacation in Palau.
299,00:16:40.83,00:16:40.83,(whispers indistinctly)That feels great.
300,00:16:46.70,00:16:46.70,"This is unbelievable.I'm sitting there loving it,"

326,00:18:03.80,00:18:03.80,so it was the next-best thingto having my sister.
327,00:18:06.23,00:18:06.23,I couldn't ask for a betterreward.
328,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,>> It was the most phenomenalexperience of my lifetime.
329,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> Now they're doing it.>> But you're sure that she's
330,00:18:28.50,00:18:28.50,ready to go against me withthem?

334,00:18:44.17,00:18:44.17,You put Gregg and Caryn upagainst the wall.
335,00:18:46.50,00:18:46.50,>> And so we need to break thistie.
336,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,">> Katie is forced to switchher vote, because she knows that"

342,00:19:07.20,00:19:07.20,Whoever gets the purple stoneis going home that night.
343,00:19:10.67,00:19:10.67,That's a calculated riskon our part.
344,00:19:12.67,00:19:12.67,>> Maybe she picks the rock andthen we have to pick a rock
345,00:19:15.03,00:19:15.03,"to see who goes home.It sucks, but I can go to Tribal"

347,00:19:20.50,00:19:20.50,"Like, I'm willing to makethat gamble."
348,00:19:22.50,00:19:22.50,I came to play a game.>> That's the plan.
349,00:19:25.90,00:19:25.90,>> You and I are both willingto choose rocks.
350,00:19:28.00,00:19:28.00,>> And we should be.>> That's right.

356,00:19:46.40,00:19:46.40,had to take.>> It's a gamble.
357,00:19:48.40,00:19:48.40,"Hopefully, Katie realizes thatshe doesn't want to pick a rock."
358,00:19:51.37,00:19:51.37,She wants to stay in the game.This is the biggest step that
359,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,you and I have to get to thefinal three.
360,00:19:55.67,00:19:55.67,That's why it's important thathe does not see it coming.
361,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,Any leaks and we're done.The game's over for us.
362,00:20:00.60,00:20:00.60,It's a delicate operation thatneeds to be handled with the
363,00:20:02.70,00:20:02.70,utmost of care.It's kind of like taking a bag
364,00:20:05.23,00:20:05.23,"of potato chips from a fat man.You can do it, but you'd better"
365,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80,"do it quick.Otherwise, he'll turn around"
366,00:20:09.70,00:20:09.70,and sit on you.>> You've been acting the last

563,00:32:28.97,00:32:28.97,"I was going five, you were goingfour, so rightfully so, I should"
564,00:32:32.20,00:32:32.20,be the one taking the risk.We've got a plan in place.
565,00:32:35.87,00:32:35.87,"Ian and I are gonna pretend thatthere's nothing going on,"
566,00:32:38.23,00:32:38.23,everything is fine.But the three of us--
567,00:32:40.97,00:32:40.97,"myself, Ian and Caryn--will vote for Gregg tonight,"
568,00:32:44.53,00:32:44.53,"the other three will votefor Caryn, and then we'll"
569,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,go to a draw and be forcedto pick a stone.
570,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,But it won't be Ian who hasto choose-- he won immunity.
571,00:32:52.47,00:32:52.47,"It'll be me.So I'm very vulnerable, but it's"
572,00:32:55.40,00:32:55.40,better to play it hard and gohome tonight than to sit around
573,00:32:58.77,00:32:58.77,here and just wait to beeliminated by their threesome.
574,00:33:01.80,00:33:01.80,">> So, we're good with theimmunity today."
575,00:33:04.10,00:33:04.10,We needed Caryn not to get it.>> Yeah. We should all be pretty
576,00:33:07.27,00:33:07.27,"proud of the fact we lookedaround and said, ""Hey, five"
577,00:33:09.77,00:33:09.77,"of us."">> Right."
578,00:33:11.10,00:33:11.10,>> Yeah.>> We're there.
579,00:33:13.57,00:33:13.57,I was a little nervousstepping away from the game for
580,00:33:16.87,00:33:16.87,"a while, so it was comfortingto come back and get no"
581,00:33:19.17,00:33:19.17,mysterious looks or no...people trying to connive.
582,00:33:23.27,00:33:23.27,"So, I can say with a lot ofconfidence that Caryn will be"
583,00:33:26.37,00:33:26.37,"going home tonight.I mean, you could tell, she's"
584,00:33:29.03,00:33:29.03,"just out of commission today.>> Caryn's in a Janu place, huh?"
585,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,">> Yeah.>> Well, that's what happens"
586,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,when you know you're done.>> Caryn is winning an Academy

590,00:33:46.83,00:33:46.83,"So, this should be a totalsurprise tonight."
591,00:33:50.37,00:33:50.37,>> I think so.>> Interesting or...
592,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,>> No. Just it's gonna be...>> It's always interesting.
593,00:34:00.10,00:34:00.10,>> Yeah.>> I'll start getting some
594,00:34:03.13,00:34:03.13,firewood.>> All right.

603,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,over you.>> Aw...
604,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,>> And that I was gonnaprotect you.
605,00:34:45.30,00:34:45.30,>> That's still the deal for me.>> Good.
606,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,>> There's only two people inthis game that I've made

608,00:34:52.73,00:34:52.73,"wouldn't write her name down,and I told her brother-in-law"
609,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,"I had her back, and that meansa lot to me, so..."

618,00:35:25.97,00:35:25.97,">> It goes to rocks.You know, that's why I wanted to"
619,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"give you the heads-up.>> Ian pulled me aside, like,"
620,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,right before we went to TribalCouncil with the idea of taking
621,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,out Gregg.I had some issues with it.
622,00:35:36.40,00:35:36.40,"I'm, like, you know it's reallyunfair for you just to come in"
623,00:35:38.80,00:35:38.80,"and say, this is what we'redoing, this is what the plan is."

625,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,"But I'm just thinking asfar as I'm concerned, I was"

636,00:36:12.53,00:36:12.53,The reason Ian wants me with himin the end is so he'll win.
637,00:36:16.13,00:36:16.13,Tom wants the same thing.>> I'm ready to go.
638,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,">> When it comes down to it,I'm gonna have to make a"
