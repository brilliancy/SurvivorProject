3,00:00:06.23,00:00:06.23,">> PROBST: After Janu shocked her tribe by quitting the game,"
4,00:00:09.20,00:00:09.20,Koror's plan to oust Stephenie was out in the open.
5,00:00:12.10,00:00:12.10,>> STEPHENIE: I don't know who to trust.
6,00:00:14.10,00:00:14.10,I don't know who to talk to. I almost don't want to talk
7,00:00:16.07,00:00:16.07,to anybody. >> PROBST: But Stephenie's
8,00:00:17.33,00:00:17.33,presence in the game put the men on edge.
9,00:00:18.90,00:00:18.90,>> Stephenie progressing in this game means that Koror
10,00:00:21.33,00:00:21.33,falls apart. >> PROBST: Tom was also feeling
11,00:00:23.37,00:00:23.37,vulnerable. >> I'm pleading for my life.
12,00:00:25.87,00:00:25.87,"My strength in the challenges, it's part of what got us to"
13,00:00:29.23,00:00:29.23,this point. >> PROBST: But the women saw
14,00:00:31.60,00:00:31.60,an opportunity and a plan was hatched.
15,00:00:35.53,00:00:35.53,>> I think it's an awesome idea. >> Who would be the first one
16,00:00:37.53,00:00:37.53,you'd want off? >> You want to think I'm
17,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,a threat? I'll show you how threatening
18,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53,I am. >> PROBST: Before the immunity
19,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77,"challenge, Tom turned to Caryn. >> I think that we do have some"
20,00:00:48.20,00:00:48.20,kind of a sympathetic thing going where we're going to
21,00:00:51.00,00:00:51.00,look out for each other. It was a good move on my part
22,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,to be friends with Caryn. >> PROBST: At the immunity
23,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,"challenge, the pressure was on. There are five tiles for"
24,00:01:00.57,00:01:00.57,each of you. First person to break all five
25,00:01:03.37,00:01:03.37,of their tiles wins immunity. But Ian was handed victory
26,00:01:06.33,00:01:06.33,when Tom took out his last tile. Ian wins immunity.
27,00:01:11.90,00:01:11.90,">> Thank you, guys. >> PROBST: Back at camp,"
28,00:01:14.90,00:01:14.90,Katie approached Caryn about the women's alliance.
29,00:01:19.20,00:01:19.20,Stick with the women and take out the men?
30,00:01:21.03,00:01:21.03,>> PROBST: Caryn leaked the information.
31,00:01:23.17,00:01:23.17,>> What do the girls think? >> Trying to figure out
32,00:01:26.37,00:01:26.37,which side to take out. >> PROBST: So Ian confronted
33,00:01:32.10,00:01:32.10,Katie when he learned of her plan.
34,00:01:34.10,00:01:34.10,>> Caryn is spreading that you're trying to get all the
35,00:01:36.07,00:01:36.07,girls against the guys. >> I just hate for it to be such
36,00:01:38.07,00:01:38.07,a sweep and Tom just takes the whole thing and none of
37,00:01:40.07,00:01:40.07,us have a chance. >> PROBST: All hope for the
38,00:01:42.07,00:01:42.07,women's alliance was crushed... It's already been too much
39,00:01:44.07,00:01:44.07,of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go.
40,00:01:46.07,00:01:46.07,Too much of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go.
41,00:01:48.07,00:01:48.07,>> PROBST: But Steph still clung to hope.
42,00:01:50.07,00:01:50.07,">> I've said my piece, I planted my seed."
43,00:01:52.07,00:01:52.07,"If they're smart, Tom will be the next one to go."
44,00:01:54.07,00:01:54.07,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, although Caryn received one"
45,00:01:57.40,00:01:57.40,"vote, Koror stuck together. The third member of our jury,"
46,00:02:00.53,00:02:00.53,"Steph. And Stephenie, the only"
47,00:02:02.80,00:02:02.80,"remaining Ulong member, was finally voted out."
48,00:02:06.10,00:02:06.10,The tribe has spoken. Six are left.
49,00:02:10.23,00:02:10.23,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
50,00:02:50.07,00:02:50.07,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa (man groaning)
51,00:03:40.93,00:03:40.93,>> Poor girl. Did you see her face?
52,00:03:43.63,00:03:43.63,She was probably stressing out. >> It was horrible. I know.
53,00:03:46.73,00:03:46.73,>> I felt bad. >> Stephenie was the one
54,00:03:49.53,00:03:49.53,voted off. I thought that it could
55,00:03:51.53,00:03:51.53,have been me last night. I wouldn't blame them.
56,00:03:53.73,00:03:53.73,"If I was playing against me, I'd want me out of here, too,"
57,00:03:56.40,00:03:56.40,but they didn't do it; it was a relief.
58,00:03:59.50,00:03:59.50,"They're holding true to the five, and would I like to"
59,00:04:02.07,00:04:02.07,believe that it will continue to do that.
60,00:04:10.70,00:04:10.70,>> Everything's good; everything's good.
61,00:04:12.27,00:04:12.27,>> I'm going to tell you I've been trying to think of
62,00:04:14.27,00:04:14.27,different things. I'm up all night running
63,00:04:16.13,00:04:16.13,"scenarios. >> Me, too."
64,00:04:17.70,00:04:17.70,>> Caryn and I spoke on the way to tree mail.
65,00:04:21.63,00:04:21.63,She's more nervous than a long- tailed cat in a roomful of
66,00:04:24.53,00:04:24.53,"rocking chairs, at this point. She knows that she's outside"
67,00:04:28.83,00:04:28.83,"of an alliance of five, so she feels she's next."
68,00:04:31.57,00:04:31.57,I can't step out from five to side with one right now.
69,00:04:36.27,00:04:36.27,>> Uh-huh. >> And what you've got to do
70,00:04:39.20,00:04:39.20,is pull your own savior; your salvation.
71,00:04:50.73,00:04:50.73,>> I've been telling Tom and Ian that Gregg and Jenn need to be
72,00:04:56.13,00:04:56.13,"split, and he said he knew that, but that he could not turn"
73,00:04:59.90,00:04:59.90,"against the five people that he had the alliance with, so..."
74,00:05:03.83,00:05:03.83,"I am definitely the most vulnerable of the six remaining,"
75,00:05:06.23,00:05:06.23,no question about it. I'm just hoping and praying
76,00:05:09.03,00:05:09.03,"that something happens. Otherwise, I'm going home."
77,00:05:11.97,00:05:11.97,">> Scamper, scamper, scamper. We got tree mail."
78,00:05:14.40,00:05:14.40,">> We're up, we're up, we're up. >> ""Care for a bit of R&R?"

86,00:05:42.40,00:05:42.40,>> I know. >> Everybody wants this.
87,00:05:47.73,00:05:47.73,">> Katie and I promised each other, if we won a challenge,"
88,00:05:49.77,00:05:49.77,"we'd take each other if we have the ability, and that's what"
89,00:05:52.23,00:05:52.23,"we're gonna today do. >> Oh, my God. Oh, God."
90,00:05:55.00,00:05:55.00,"I'm fighting hard for this one. >> Me, too."
91,00:06:05.50,00:06:05.50,>> PROBST: Come on in! We are down to six.
92,00:06:12.37,00:06:12.37,"For today's reward challenge, I'm going to ask you a series"
93,00:06:15.47,00:06:15.47,of questions about Palau and Micronesia.

97,00:06:28.30,00:06:28.30,goes in the water; they're out of the challenge.
98,00:06:30.93,00:06:30.93,"Last person left standing, wins reward."

191,00:11:03.90,00:11:03.90,">> Is that horrible if I hit you, Jenn?"
192,00:11:06.00,00:11:06.00,"You'll never live it down, ever. >> PROBST: Wait, Gregg."
193,00:11:09.23,00:11:09.23,>> Yeah. Did you just ask permission?
194,00:11:11.00,00:11:11.00,">> Yes, he did. >> Wow."
195,00:11:12.83,00:11:12.83,">> Is it okay, dear? >> What a..."
196,00:11:14.40,00:11:14.40,">> Gregg, be a man. >> Don't do it, Gregg."
197,00:11:16.40,00:11:16.40,>> I can't believe you're doing that.
198,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,">> You said, ""I'll save you."" >> If you hit me, she's going"
199,00:11:20.07,00:11:20.07,"to hit me, too, I'll be out. >> PROBST: Wow."
200,00:11:23.27,00:11:23.27,">> You suck, Gregg. >> PROBST: Gregg hits Katie."
201,00:11:25.63,00:11:25.63,"Katie comes back and hits Gregg, and no smile on that face."
202,00:11:30.87,00:11:30.87,Interesting how that works. Jenn is now in the lead.
203,00:11:33.57,00:11:33.57,Gregg and Katie down to their last drop.
204,00:11:36.27,00:11:36.27,Jenn still has two hits. True or false...
205,00:11:38.63,00:11:38.63,"""Palau was the first nation in the world to issue the Elvis"

207,00:11:48.77,00:11:48.77,"Gregg got it right, Jenn got it right."
208,00:11:50.50,00:11:50.50,"Katie got it wrong. Jenn, you're up."
209,00:11:52.63,00:11:52.63,">> Sorry, Katie. >> Don't."
210,00:11:54.67,00:11:54.67,>> I'm sorry. >> PROBST: Katie is out of the
211,00:11:59.43,00:11:59.43,"competition, takes a seat on the bench."
212,00:12:01.80,00:12:01.80,Gregg's only choice is Jenn. >> At least he didn't ask.
213,00:12:07.20,00:12:07.20,>> PROBST: You both have one hit left.
214,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,"One person gets it right, and the other person gets it wrong,"
215,00:12:12.20,00:12:12.20,"that's it. ""The coconut crabs which inhabit"

221,00:12:33.57,00:12:33.57,">> PROBST: Gregg says ""A) change That is right."
222,00:12:37.40,00:12:37.40,"Gregg, make your final hit. Gregg has no choice."
223,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77,">> Oh, damn. >> Sorry, Jenn."
224,00:12:41.43,00:12:41.43,">> PROBST: Takes Jenn, puts her out of the challenge."
225,00:12:44.20,00:12:44.20,Gregg wins reward. >> Sorry.
226,00:12:45.70,00:12:45.70,">> Good job, Gregg. >> PROBST: Yacht, shower..."
227,00:12:49.83,00:12:49.83,">> Sorry. >> PROBST: ...massage,"
228,00:12:51.83,00:12:51.83,big feast. Obviously it wouldn't be much
229,00:12:53.73,00:12:53.73,fun alone. >> Oh!
230,00:12:55.50,00:12:55.50,"So pick one person to join you. >> Sorry, guys."
231,00:13:03.23,00:13:03.23,"Jenn, let's go. >> Oh!"
232,00:13:04.97,00:13:04.97,Thank you. >> Ooh...
233,00:13:11.13,00:13:11.13,>> PROBST: I'm sure you guys will have a good time together.
234,00:13:14.03,00:13:14.03,"And two is very fun, but three is a party."
235,00:13:16.10,00:13:16.10,"Pick one more person. >> Oh, God!"
236,00:13:18.20,00:13:18.20,">> Oh! >> Sorry, man."
237,00:13:21.33,00:13:21.33,>> Katie. (cheering)
238,00:13:25.37,00:13:25.37,">> You are forgiven. >> Hey, guys, I'm so sorry."
239,00:13:29.13,00:13:29.13,"I will, uh... I will pay you back."
240,00:13:31.03,00:13:31.03,">> Oh, no, we'll pay you back. (laughing)"
241,00:13:34.40,00:13:34.40,">> PROBST: Tom, Ian, Caryn, head on back to camp."
242,00:13:37.93,00:13:37.93,"All right, guys, your yacht is waiting."
243,00:13:39.57,00:13:39.57,Have a good night. That's the icing on the cake.
244,00:13:56.80,00:13:56.80,We didn't come here for the icing.
245,00:13:58.47,00:13:58.47,We came for the cake. Let's go talk.
246,00:14:00.63,00:14:00.63,I have an idea. >> You do?
247,00:14:02.27,00:14:02.27,>> Yeah. >> Really?
248,00:14:03.53,00:14:03.53,">> Yeah. >> I'm serious about it, yeah."
249,00:14:04.60,00:14:04.60,">> Today at the challenge, Katie chose to throw me into the water"
250,00:14:08.07,00:14:08.07,"rather than Gregg, and I said, ""Wow, that's interesting."
251,00:14:11.00,00:14:11.00,"If Katie is willing to sell me out for a night on the yacht,"
252,00:14:13.60,00:14:13.60,there's no way she's going to hold on to me for a million
253,00:14:16.00,00:14:16.00,"dollars."" We have a couple choices to"
254,00:14:17.80,00:14:17.80,"make. >> Okay, go."
255,00:14:20.20,00:14:20.20,">> The way that I see it right now, we have lost control of"
256,00:14:23.63,00:14:23.63,the game. >> Why?
257,00:14:25.23,00:14:25.23,>> We're not making the decisions.
258,00:14:26.77,00:14:26.77,"Gregg and Jenn are. >> Why, 'cause they won one"
259,00:14:29.00,00:14:29.00,"challenge? >> No, uh-uh."
260,00:14:30.67,00:14:30.67,"I think that they got Katie, and one of the three of us out."
261,00:14:33.13,00:14:33.13,"Me, Tom, you. >> Mm-hmm."
262,00:14:36.47,00:14:36.47,>> I think it goes in that order.
263,00:14:38.40,00:14:38.40,I know they're ready to turn on you.
264,00:14:40.27,00:14:40.27,I know for a fact. >> And you think Katie is in
265,00:14:42.90,00:14:42.90,"with that? >> Yeah, I think she is."
266,00:14:44.57,00:14:44.57,">> Caryn warned me that Katie was looking to get rid of me,"
267,00:14:48.07,00:14:48.07,but I still wasn't willing to take her word over Katie's at
268,00:14:50.87,00:14:50.87,"that point. Now, Ian says Katie, she's now"
269,00:14:54.40,00:14:54.40,"become the shady lady Katie, looking to dump us and go into"
270,00:14:58.00,00:14:58.00,the final with Gregg and Jenn. >> I think Gregg is a dark horse
271,00:15:00.00,00:15:00.00,right now. >> Yeah.
272,00:15:02.00,00:15:02.00,>> Nobody would vote against him in the final two.
273,00:15:04.00,00:15:04.00,>> Nobody. Especially... >> Why?
274,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,">> He's never made any enemies. >> He hasn't pissed anybody off,"
275,00:15:07.93,00:15:07.93,he's very affable. He works hard.
276,00:15:10.90,00:15:10.90,>> What do you think? >> We go for Gregg tomorrow
277,00:15:15.83,00:15:15.83,night. >> Do we?
278,00:15:19.97,00:15:19.97,">> We'd tie, wouldn't we? >> Yeah."
279,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17,"Three would go against me, and three would go against"
280,00:15:25.37,00:15:25.37,Gregg. What more do you propose?
281,00:15:28.00,00:15:28.00,>> I don't know what the next step is.
282,00:15:31.90,00:15:31.90,">> Suddenly, the sequence of events have fallen into place"
283,00:15:35.80,00:15:35.80,"that have really benefited me. Those five had an alliance,"
284,00:15:40.07,00:15:40.07,"and, lucky for me, that alliance is breaking down now."
285,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen.
286,00:15:45.47,00:15:45.47,The only thing I can do is to keep close to Tom and Ian.
287,00:15:48.23,00:15:48.23,That's all I can do. That's my only hope.
288,00:15:58.93,00:15:58.93,">> Gregg, you got to go on first."
289,00:16:00.67,00:16:00.67,">> This is awesome. >> Oh, my God."
290,00:16:02.60,00:16:02.60,>> We get to the boat and Captain Mike greets us and lets
291,00:16:06.53,00:16:06.53,"us know this is a day of being pampered, VIP treatment."
292,00:16:10.27,00:16:10.27,">> Rooms one and two. >> Oh, my gosh."
293,00:16:13.70,00:16:13.70,>> He shows us to the bunks and when we walked in we found
294,00:16:16.13,00:16:16.13,our bathing suits which we haven't seen since we left
295,00:16:18.37,00:16:18.37,for the island. (shouting)
296,00:16:20.83,00:16:20.83,We were so excited to get on to the next event.
297,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,"So we quickly scrubbed up, threw the bathrobe on and then we went"
298,00:16:27.23,00:16:27.23,up to the deck for full-body massages.
299,00:16:30.03,00:16:30.03,It felt like finally I was on vacation in Palau.
300,00:16:40.83,00:16:40.83,(whispers indistinctly) That feels great.
301,00:16:46.70,00:16:46.70,"This is unbelievable. I'm sitting there loving it,"
302,00:16:50.67,00:16:50.67,"just relaxing, and then I noticed the hands feel a little"
303,00:16:54.20,00:16:54.20,"colder, feel a little different. Next thing I know I get a hard"
304,00:16:58.97,00:16:58.97,"smack on the ass, and I do a double take."
305,00:17:02.63,00:17:02.63,"My eyes have been closed, I've been daydreaming."
306,00:17:05.40,00:17:05.40,"And my best friend from home, Greg, is staring at me, and he's"
307,00:17:08.07,00:17:08.07,"like what's up? >> Looking fine, dude."
308,00:17:09.83,00:17:09.83,">> Doing well, man. >> Yeah, hell, yeah."
309,00:17:12.03,00:17:12.03,>> We were both in disbelief. >> It was nuts.
310,00:17:14.10,00:17:14.10,We didn't know how to react. >> Cheers.
311,00:17:15.87,00:17:15.87,>> I don't even know where to begin.
312,00:17:17.33,00:17:17.33,">> Cheers. >> Oh, my God, what's this?"
313,00:17:19.40,00:17:19.40,"What?! Oh, my God."
314,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,>> Shrimp and... >> What is this?
315,00:17:25.00,00:17:25.00,">> Dig in, man. >> This is an onion ring."
316,00:17:26.73,00:17:26.73,>> This is beautiful. >> Calamari.
317,00:17:28.63,00:17:28.63,">> This is, by far, the best reward challenge,"
318,00:17:30.80,00:17:30.80,"I mean, obviously. >> Oh, my God!"
319,00:17:34.17,00:17:34.17,">> Oh, my God! >> You got... you got all the"
320,00:17:42.63,00:17:42.63,"stuff? >> All of a sudden, I get a tap"
321,00:17:46.67,00:17:46.67,"on my shoulder, and it's my sister Kim."
322,00:17:48.67,00:17:48.67,"All I could do was bawl, like cry."
323,00:17:50.53,00:17:50.53,"That's all I could do. I was just like, oh, my God."
324,00:17:52.53,00:17:52.53,She's here! >> We're going to have a party!
325,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,>> Stan is my sister's husband. He is the brother I never had.
326,00:18:00.63,00:18:00.63,"My sister just had a baby, so she wasn't able to come,"
327,00:18:03.80,00:18:03.80,so it was the next-best thing to having my sister.
328,00:18:06.23,00:18:06.23,I couldn't ask for a better reward.
329,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,>> It was the most phenomenal experience of my lifetime.
330,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> Now they're doing it. >> But you're sure that she's
331,00:18:28.50,00:18:28.50,ready to go against me with them?
332,00:18:30.60,00:18:30.60,">> Yep. >> Mm-hmm, I know that."
333,00:18:32.97,00:18:32.97,>> So Gregg should go tomorrow? >> Mm-hmm.
334,00:18:42.37,00:18:42.37,>> It would be very easy in a tie situation.
335,00:18:44.17,00:18:44.17,You put Gregg and Caryn up against the wall.
336,00:18:46.50,00:18:46.50,>> And so we need to break this tie.
337,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,">> Katie is forced to switch her vote, because she knows that"
338,00:18:51.53,00:18:51.53,"if she doesn't, she has to pick a rock."
339,00:18:53.53,00:18:53.53,">> Right. >> The way the rules are, if"
340,00:18:55.67,00:18:55.67,"there is a tie at Tribal Council, both members who were"
341,00:18:59.27,00:18:59.27,"voted on, those two will become safe and it comes down to the"
342,00:19:03.27,00:19:03.27,"rest of us, reaching in a bag, pulling out a colored stone."
343,00:19:07.20,00:19:07.20,Whoever gets the purple stone is going home that night.
344,00:19:10.67,00:19:10.67,That's a calculated risk on our part.
345,00:19:12.67,00:19:12.67,>> Maybe she picks the rock and then we have to pick a rock
346,00:19:15.03,00:19:15.03,"to see who goes home. It sucks, but I can go to Tribal"
347,00:19:17.93,00:19:17.93,"Council willing to take the rock, you know what I mean?"
348,00:19:20.50,00:19:20.50,"Like, I'm willing to make that gamble."
349,00:19:22.50,00:19:22.50,I came to play a game. >> That's the plan.
350,00:19:25.90,00:19:25.90,>> You and I are both willing to choose rocks.
351,00:19:28.00,00:19:28.00,>> And we should be. >> That's right.
352,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,Let's do this. >> Desperate times call for
353,00:19:35.77,00:19:35.77,"desperate measures, right? >> We have a plan."
354,00:19:39.17,00:19:39.17,>> Tom and I have decided that we're going to force a tie
355,00:19:41.37,00:19:41.37,at Tribal Council. We've prepared ourselves for the
356,00:19:44.20,00:19:44.20,"idea that we might be going home, but this is a risk we"
357,00:19:46.40,00:19:46.40,had to take. >> It's a gamble.
358,00:19:48.40,00:19:48.40,"Hopefully, Katie realizes that she doesn't want to pick a rock."
359,00:19:51.37,00:19:51.37,She wants to stay in the game. This is the biggest step that
360,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,you and I have to get to the final three.
361,00:19:55.67,00:19:55.67,That's why it's important that he does not see it coming.
362,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,Any leaks and we're done. The game's over for us.
363,00:20:00.60,00:20:00.60,It's a delicate operation that needs to be handled with the
364,00:20:02.70,00:20:02.70,utmost of care. It's kind of like taking a bag
365,00:20:05.23,00:20:05.23,"of potato chips from a fat man. You can do it, but you'd better"
366,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80,"do it quick. Otherwise, he'll turn around"
367,00:20:09.70,00:20:09.70,and sit on you. >> You've been acting the last
368,00:20:11.70,00:20:11.70,two days like you're about to be sent home.
369,00:20:13.77,00:20:13.77,>> Uh-huh. >> Continue to act that way.
370,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,>> Okay. >> Do not say a word...
371,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,> Don't be chipper. Be down and dour.
372,00:20:20.27,00:20:20.27,>> Okay. >> Okay.
373,00:20:21.23,00:20:21.23,>> Okay? >> Yep.
374,00:20:22.30,00:20:22.30,I can do it. I'm psyched.
375,00:20:24.90,00:20:24.90,I'm totally psyched. This is really working out well.
376,00:20:27.13,00:20:27.13,"I think we can pull this off, I really do."
377,00:20:29.70,00:20:29.70,"Because you know what? I'm a very good actress,"
378,00:20:31.60,00:20:31.60,"very, very good. >> This is so gorgeous."
379,00:20:43.87,00:20:43.87,We're on a boat going to this lagoon.
380,00:20:45.77,00:20:45.77,"We're just thinking snorkeling, we have no idea."
381,00:20:48.20,00:20:48.20,">> I don't know. >> Oh, my gosh, there's"
382,00:20:51.20,00:20:51.20,"dolphins! >> All of a sudden, all of us"
383,00:20:54.47,00:20:54.47,see these fins that are just swimming through the water and
384,00:20:59.07,00:20:59.07,"we're like oh, my God, no way, no way!"
385,00:21:08.47,00:21:08.47,>> Hi. >> Hi.
386,00:21:15.20,00:21:15.20,">> Oh, my gosh. >> Swimming with the dolphins"
387,00:21:19.83,00:21:19.83,"was, by far, the most magical moment I've ever had."
388,00:21:23.57,00:21:23.57,It was something I've always wanted to do.
389,00:21:25.23,00:21:25.23,"I mean, it's like my dream. >> Hi!"
390,00:21:27.53,00:21:27.53,">> Oh, this is... >> Oh!"
391,00:21:28.53,00:21:28.53,>> I'm so happy. >> It was the most surreal
392,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,"experience I've ever had, and to be able to share that"
393,00:21:33.67,00:21:33.67,with my sister was just incredible.
394,00:21:35.70,00:21:35.70,"I kept going, ""I can't believe you're here for this."""
395,00:21:39.40,00:21:39.40,"It's just the experience of a lifetime, and she got to"
396,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,share it with me. I never wanted it to end.
397,00:21:45.17,00:21:45.17,It was unbelievable. >> Cheers. I can't reach.
398,00:21:55.97,00:21:55.97,">> After the day of snorkeling, and hanging with the dolphins,"
399,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,we were able to do a little strategy talk.
400,00:22:01.07,00:22:01.07,"This was our opportunity to confirm that, hey, guys,"
401,00:22:03.40,00:22:03.40,it's us three to the final three.
402,00:22:06.40,00:22:06.40,"We happen to have a good bond, and it just also benefits"
403,00:22:09.63,00:22:09.63,the three of us to go to the final three.
404,00:22:18.97,00:22:18.97,">> I came into this knowing that I might have to jump ship, if"
405,00:22:21.87,00:22:21.87,it comes down to it. My strategy is to stick with
406,00:22:24.27,00:22:24.27,those people that make the decisions until those people no
407,00:22:27.07,00:22:27.07,"longer have any power, and then jump to the next person that"
408,00:22:29.07,00:22:29.07,makes the decision. >> Yeah.
409,00:22:42.97,00:22:42.97,">> We all realize the threats that Ian and Tom are, so it was"
410,00:22:46.27,00:22:46.27,good to get agreement with that. It felt real.
411,00:22:48.20,00:22:48.20,It felt true. And I believe that that bond
412,00:22:50.57,00:22:50.57,is-is tight till the end. >> I hear a boat.
413,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,">> I think it's them. >> Oh, yeah."
414,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,">> Here we go, guys. >> Let's do this right."
415,00:23:08.57,00:23:08.57,">> I'm sour and dour. >> Hey, hey!"
416,00:23:12.30,00:23:12.30,>> What's happening? >> Who's that?
417,00:23:16.00,00:23:16.00,>> I don't know. >> That's their families.
418,00:23:19.37,00:23:19.37,">> Oh, no. >> Oh, no."
419,00:23:20.73,00:23:20.73,">> Oh, no. >> Those are your families."
420,00:23:22.53,00:23:22.53,"Today I think my worst fears were, uh... realized."
421,00:23:27.43,00:23:27.43,Only three family members got to spend time with their loved
422,00:23:31.50,00:23:31.50,"ones, and the other three are left on the beach to, uh, hear"
423,00:23:35.60,00:23:35.60,the stories. >> How you doing? I'm Tom.
424,00:23:37.73,00:23:37.73,">> This one cuts and twists, and, uh, it's tough."
425,00:23:41.33,00:23:41.33,>> We're almost there. >> I know.
426,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,>> We'll plow through. >> Yeah.
427,00:23:44.37,00:23:44.37,">> Get-Get this thing done. >> It'll get tough, you know,"
428,00:23:46.60,00:23:46.60,when you guys get down to picking people that you care
429,00:23:48.57,00:23:48.57,about off. >> Sure.
430,00:23:50.43,00:23:50.43,">> Well, if there's one person that, uh..."
431,00:23:52.33,00:23:52.33,">> You've got somebody looking out for her out here, it's me"
432,00:23:54.63,00:23:54.63,"looking out for her, so... >> Good."
433,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,I appreciate that. >> When my friend Greg had to
434,00:24:04.47,00:24:04.47,"leave, it was just really tough. >> Remember, we're all proud"
435,00:24:09.30,00:24:09.30,"of you at home. >> You know, it was only a year"
436,00:24:11.67,00:24:11.67,"ago that my dad passed away, and the grieving still happens"
437,00:24:13.67,00:24:13.67,every day. Just tell my mom that I love
438,00:24:16.83,00:24:16.83,her so much and I cannot wait to just spend time with her
439,00:24:19.70,00:24:19.70,when I get back. Will you tell her that?
440,00:24:22.30,00:24:22.30,>> I will. >> Just tell her...
441,00:24:29.33,00:24:29.33,>> This might have been the last love fest in camp.
442,00:24:32.73,00:24:32.73,>> Let's do a really cheesy... (indistinct voices)
443,00:24:36.23,00:24:36.23,">> Now it's time to get control of the game again, and focus on"
444,00:24:40.63,00:24:40.63,the coming six days and what needs to be accomplished.
445,00:24:44.60,00:24:44.60,"It has been a good run, but it's about to get a little rough."
446,00:24:48.90,00:24:48.90,That little trip that they took may cost them big.
447,00:25:02.33,00:25:02.33,>> Tree mail. >> What have we got?
448,00:25:08.43,00:25:08.43,">> ""Some played hard, some just watched and others just"

454,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,>> What? >> Wow.
455,00:25:27.50,00:25:27.50,">> In order for our plan to work, a lot has to happen today."
456,00:25:30.83,00:25:30.83,"Worst case scenario is Gregg wins immunity, so we really"
457,00:25:33.47,00:25:33.47,need to work hard today and make sure that doesn't happen.
458,00:25:35.50,00:25:35.50,I didn't come to play for sixth or fifth or fourth or third or
459,00:25:37.50,00:25:37.50,second. I'm going to do my damndest
460,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,to make sure that I come across the finish line first.
461,00:25:48.30,00:25:48.30,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! How's it going, everybody?"
462,00:25:54.03,00:25:54.03,">> Hey, Jeff. >> PROBST: Ready to get to"

466,00:26:08.30,00:26:08.30,for grabs. It is rare in this game
467,00:26:10.43,00:26:10.43,of Survivor that you get a second chance.
468,00:26:12.83,00:26:12.83,Today's challenge provides just that-- a second chance to
469,00:26:15.77,00:26:15.77,revisit some of the challenges from the past.
470,00:26:18.10,00:26:18.10,It is a Survivor elimination-style challenge.
471,00:26:22.00,00:26:22.00,All six of you will race up the net maze.

473,00:26:28.47,00:26:28.47,you will race to a symbol-- a land version of the sea star

475,00:26:34.40,00:26:34.40,"will move on to the next round, where you will eat three balut,"
476,00:26:38.13,00:26:38.13,a partially-developed duck egg. The first three to get the balut

480,00:26:53.33,00:26:53.33,The last two Survivors will compete in a head-to-head
481,00:26:56.87,00:26:56.87,shooting competition. The first Survivor to knock
482,00:26:59.87,00:26:59.87,out their three targets wins immunity.

494,00:27:53.17,00:27:53.17,solve. First four to finish their sea

546,00:31:20.07,00:31:20.07,"Tom, still not on the board. All Ian has to do is knock"
547,00:31:23.90,00:31:23.90,out his last blue target. And he does.
548,00:31:29.03,00:31:29.03,>> Whoo! >> Wow.
549,00:31:30.47,00:31:30.47,>> PROBST: Ian wins immunity. >> Nice job. Good shooting.

554,00:31:43.60,00:31:43.60,not the same for you. One of you is going home
555,00:31:46.03,00:31:46.03,tonight. Should be a fun afternoon
556,00:31:47.63,00:31:47.63,back at camp. I'll see you at Tribal Council
557,00:31:49.47,00:31:49.47,tonight. Head on back.
558,00:32:09.53,00:32:09.53,>> I remember the jungle course being a lot easier on day three.

561,00:32:19.33,00:32:19.33,"It's very fortunate I became a fireman rather than a cop,"
562,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90,because it would just be dangerous for everybody.
563,00:32:25.97,00:32:25.97,"Well, that's okay. 'Cause you know what?"
564,00:32:28.97,00:32:28.97,"I was going five, you were going four, so rightfully so, I should"
565,00:32:32.20,00:32:32.20,be the one taking the risk. We've got a plan in place.
566,00:32:35.87,00:32:35.87,"Ian and I are gonna pretend that there's nothing going on,"
567,00:32:38.23,00:32:38.23,everything is fine. But the three of us--
568,00:32:40.97,00:32:40.97,"myself, Ian and Caryn-- will vote for Gregg tonight,"
569,00:32:44.53,00:32:44.53,"the other three will vote for Caryn, and then we'll"
570,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,go to a draw and be forced to pick a stone.
571,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,But it won't be Ian who has to choose-- he won immunity.
572,00:32:52.47,00:32:52.47,"It'll be me. So I'm very vulnerable, but it's"
573,00:32:55.40,00:32:55.40,better to play it hard and go home tonight than to sit around
574,00:32:58.77,00:32:58.77,here and just wait to be eliminated by their threesome.
575,00:33:01.80,00:33:01.80,">> So, we're good with the immunity today."
576,00:33:04.10,00:33:04.10,We needed Caryn not to get it. >> Yeah. We should all be pretty
577,00:33:07.27,00:33:07.27,"proud of the fact we looked around and said, ""Hey, five"
578,00:33:09.77,00:33:09.77,"of us."" >> Right."
579,00:33:11.10,00:33:11.10,>> Yeah. >> We're there.
580,00:33:13.57,00:33:13.57,I was a little nervous stepping away from the game for
581,00:33:16.87,00:33:16.87,"a while, so it was comforting to come back and get no"
582,00:33:19.17,00:33:19.17,mysterious looks or no... people trying to connive.
583,00:33:23.27,00:33:23.27,"So, I can say with a lot of confidence that Caryn will be"
584,00:33:26.37,00:33:26.37,"going home tonight. I mean, you could tell, she's"
585,00:33:29.03,00:33:29.03,"just out of commission today. >> Caryn's in a Janu place, huh?"
586,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,">> Yeah. >> Well, that's what happens"
587,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,when you know you're done. >> Caryn is winning an Academy
588,00:33:39.37,00:33:39.37,"Award right now. She is lying in the hut, down"
589,00:33:42.40,00:33:42.40,"and sour, like she thinks she's going home."
590,00:33:44.70,00:33:44.70,Perfect. Just the way we told her to.
591,00:33:46.83,00:33:46.83,"So, this should be a total surprise tonight."
592,00:33:50.37,00:33:50.37,>> I think so. >> Interesting or...
593,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,>> No. Just it's gonna be... >> It's always interesting.
594,00:34:00.10,00:34:00.10,>> Yeah. >> I'll start getting some
595,00:34:03.13,00:34:03.13,firewood. >> All right.
596,00:34:16.77,00:34:16.77,>> I just feel so rejuvenated. >> Yeah.
597,00:34:19.17,00:34:19.17,">> We have a good advantage. The next one, though, is the"
598,00:34:22.43,00:34:22.43,"big one. >> It's big, yeah."
599,00:34:25.17,00:34:25.17,">> Yeah. Oh, exactly."
600,00:34:31.77,00:34:31.77,>> Things going okay? >> Yeah. Yeah.
601,00:34:35.07,00:34:35.07,>> Good. Good. >> I was just thinking today
602,00:34:37.03,00:34:37.03,"a lot about family, and I just wanted to talk to you about it."
603,00:34:39.67,00:34:39.67,"I told Stan right before he left, uh, I was gonna watch"
604,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,over you. >> Aw...
605,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,>> And that I was gonna protect you.
606,00:34:45.30,00:34:45.30,>> That's still the deal for me. >> Good.
607,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,>> There's only two people in this game that I've made
608,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,"promises to; Tom's one, Katie's the other-- I told Katie I"
609,00:34:52.73,00:34:52.73,"wouldn't write her name down, and I told her brother-in-law"
610,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,"I had her back, and that means a lot to me, so..."
611,00:34:57.97,00:34:57.97,I'm gonna stay true to that. What I wanted to talk to you
612,00:35:00.50,00:35:00.50,"about was, we're gonna flip it tonight."
613,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,>> Yeah. >> What do you mean?
614,00:35:04.77,00:35:04.77,">> Um, Caryn and Tom, um, and I are gonna vote for Gregg."
615,00:35:08.03,00:35:08.03,>> Yeah. >> What?!
616,00:35:10.37,00:35:10.37,">> Yeah, we're flipping the game around."
617,00:35:21.37,00:35:21.37,"We're gonna force a tie, unless you vote Gregg."
618,00:35:24.23,00:35:24.23,">> If it's a tie, then what happens?"
619,00:35:25.97,00:35:25.97,">> It goes to rocks. You know, that's why I wanted to"
620,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"give you the heads-up. >> Ian pulled me aside, like,"
621,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,right before we went to Tribal Council with the idea of taking
622,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,out Gregg. I had some issues with it.
623,00:35:36.40,00:35:36.40,"I'm, like, you know it's really unfair for you just to come in"
624,00:35:38.80,00:35:38.80,"and say, this is what we're doing, this is what the plan is."
625,00:35:41.13,00:35:41.13,"Think about it-- for you and Tom, that's great."
626,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,"But I'm just thinking as far as I'm concerned, I was"
627,00:35:45.47,00:35:45.47,in a good place. >> I know that you're playing
628,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47,"the game, and I know that you don't want to take me to the"
629,00:35:49.40,00:35:49.40,"finals because you're afraid... >> 'Cause I wouldn't win, Ian."
630,00:35:51.53,00:35:51.53,">> Katie, if you and I go up against each other, it's gonna"
631,00:35:53.70,00:35:53.70,be a lot closer than you think. >> That's such crap.
632,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,">> He's, like, ""Do I have a reason to feel paranoid?"""
633,00:36:02.40,00:36:02.40,"I'm, like, I don't think so. >> No. I mean, that goes without"
634,00:36:05.83,00:36:05.83,"saying, right? >> I just don't want you to get"
635,00:36:08.77,00:36:08.77,dumped. I'd rather see you in the final
636,00:36:10.87,00:36:10.87,two with me. >> Right.
637,00:36:12.53,00:36:12.53,The reason Ian wants me with him in the end is so he'll win.
638,00:36:16.13,00:36:16.13,Tom wants the same thing. >> I'm ready to go.
639,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,">> When it comes down to it, I'm gonna have to make a"
640,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30,decision so I can have a better chance of winning.
641,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,I'm here to win a million dollars just like anyone else.
642,00:36:49.13,00:36:49.13,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of the jury.
643,00:36:51.30,00:36:51.30,"Coby, Janu... and Steph, voted out"
644,00:36:55.43,00:36:55.43,at the last Tribal Council. Let's talk about the reward
645,00:37:03.10,00:37:03.10,"challenge. This late in the game, they can"
646,00:37:05.87,00:37:05.87,be good news/bad news. You don't want to be away from
647,00:37:08.43,00:37:08.43,"camp and miss the politics. On the other hand, if you don't"
648,00:37:11.13,00:37:11.13,"win, you might miss out on something fantastic, like a"
649,00:37:13.80,00:37:13.80,surprise visit from the loved ones.
650,00:37:15.53,00:37:15.53,"Gregg, did it turn out to be a good thing?"
651,00:37:18.07,00:37:18.07,">> Yeah, it turned out to be a great experience."
652,00:37:20.77,00:37:20.77,"But on the other side of the coin, it-it did hurt to know"
653,00:37:23.90,00:37:23.90,"that I was leaving behind three tribe members, and they"
654,00:37:26.97,00:37:26.97,"didn't get to share in the opportunity, so, you know, it's"
655,00:37:30.20,00:37:30.20,a tough situation to be in. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
656,00:37:33.30,00:37:33.30,the reward challenge itself. It is designed to bring out
657,00:37:37.10,00:37:37.10,"the status of a tribe. Caryn, you were first out."
658,00:37:40.63,00:37:40.63,"Yeah, that was very hard. >> For some reason, they felt"
659,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,I had too many rewards. And I didn't feel I had won that
660,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,"much, but, you know, there was obviously some resentment about"
661,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,"that, 'cause my torch went out like that."
662,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,">> PROBST: Do you think that's all it was, you had a little"
663,00:37:53.07,00:37:53.07,"more food, nothing else? >> I do think so."
664,00:37:55.03,00:37:55.03,>> Yes. >> PROBST: How can it not have
665,00:37:56.97,00:37:56.97,more implications than just food when you watch Gregg ask Jenn
666,00:38:01.47,00:38:01.47,for permission about what to do? (laughter)
667,00:38:05.40,00:38:05.40,You guys are laughing; I'm serious.
668,00:38:07.37,00:38:07.37,We're down to the nitty-gritty here for a million bucks.
669,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,"Jenn, you're clearly seen as somewhat of a couple with Gregg."
670,00:38:15.20,00:38:15.20,Are you at all worried that that's going to hurt you at some
671,00:38:18.03,00:38:18.03,"point in this big, happy family? >> I do worry about that"
672,00:38:20.77,00:38:20.77,"a little bit. Um, but I do think that we're"
673,00:38:23.07,00:38:23.07,both playing a very individual game.
674,00:38:25.13,00:38:25.13,>> I think people know that Jenn and I do have a bond and a
675,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,"relationship, and, you know, it wasn't malicious or even"
676,00:38:31.90,00:38:31.90,strategic for me to want to spend some time with her.
677,00:38:35.03,00:38:35.03,"But that's not gonna have people turn against each other or, you"
678,00:38:37.93,00:38:37.93,"know, change your strategy for just one day away."
679,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,">> PROBST: Caryn, back to you. You were first out."
680,00:38:43.63,00:38:43.63,You brought more than anybody tonight.
681,00:38:45.37,00:38:45.37,It looks like you brought everything you have.
682,00:38:47.37,00:38:47.37,>> I've been carrying my stuff to every Tribal Council.
683,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,"Janu, Willard, Coby and I were not part of the five-person"
684,00:38:53.67,00:38:53.67,alliance. So...
685,00:38:56.07,00:38:56.07,"I always feel vulnerable. >> PROBST: Tom, it's now down"
686,00:38:59.67,00:38:59.67,to six people who have been together from day one.
687,00:39:02.30,00:39:02.30,Has it changed how you think about voting somebody out?
688,00:39:06.03,00:39:06.03,Because you're gonna hurt somebody.
689,00:39:07.93,00:39:07.93,"Somebody's going home tonight, and they're moving right over"
690,00:39:10.47,00:39:10.47,there. >> Right.
691,00:39:11.63,00:39:11.63,"We are friends, and we are looking to slit each other's"
692,00:39:14.70,00:39:14.70,throats at night. I think that right  now you do
693,00:39:17.63,00:39:17.63,"have an ""all is fair in love and war"" attitude that's all"
694,00:39:21.30,00:39:21.30,about advancing your move down the board.
695,00:39:23.97,00:39:23.97,">> PROBST: All right, Ian, once again, you have the"
696,00:39:27.23,00:39:27.23,immunity necklace. It is yours to keep or give up
697,00:39:29.43,00:39:29.43,"to somebody else. >> Um, I think I'll hold"
698,00:39:31.47,00:39:31.47,"on to it tonight. >> PROBST: With that, it is time"
699,00:39:33.33,00:39:33.33,"to vote. Tom, you're up."
700,00:39:51.93,00:39:51.93,">> Gregg, you're the dark horse. And it's just time for the"
701,00:39:55.67,00:39:55.67,dark horse to ride off into the sunset.
702,00:40:26.40,00:40:26.40,"I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
703,00:40:42.03,00:40:42.03,decision is final-- person voted out will be asked to leave the
704,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
705,00:40:49.27,00:40:49.27,First vote. Caryn.
706,00:40:55.90,00:40:55.90,"Caryn. Two votes Caryn. Gregg. Two votes Caryn,"
707,00:41:03.07,00:41:03.07,"one vote Gregg. Gregg. Two votes Caryn,"
708,00:41:10.07,00:41:10.07,"two votes Gregg. Gregg. That's three votes Gregg,"
709,00:41:17.47,00:41:17.47,two votes Caryn. I'll read the last vote.
710,00:41:23.10,00:41:23.10,13th person voted out of Survivor: Palau and the
711,00:41:25.77,00:41:25.77,fourth member of our jury... Gregg.
712,00:41:27.83,00:41:27.83,>> You guys are good. >> PROBST: You need to bring me
713,00:41:30.73,00:41:30.73,"your torch. Gregg, the tribe has spoken."
714,00:41:45.07,00:41:45.07,"It's time for you to go. Well, the message seems clear--"
715,00:41:59.07,00:41:59.07,"with six days left, nobody's safe anymore."
716,00:42:01.17,00:42:01.17,Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.
717,00:42:19.00,00:42:19.00,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
718,00:42:24.10,00:42:24.10,>> PROBST: Next time on... Survivor.
719,00:42:27.17,00:42:27.17,>> I don't really have a deal with Tom.
720,00:42:28.63,00:42:28.63,>> We know you have a deal with Tom.
721,00:42:30.33,00:42:30.33,>> PROBST: The women compare notes.
722,00:42:31.93,00:42:31.93,>> Katie just cleaned house. >> PROBST: And Ian and Katie
723,00:42:33.80,00:42:33.80,have a blow-out. >> You said you would never
724,00:42:35.60,00:42:35.60,"lie to me, and you did. >> Damn!"
725,00:42:37.13,00:42:37.13,>> You didn't even think about how that was gonna make me feel
726,00:42:39.90,00:42:39.90,to have you go against your word.
727,00:42:41.37,00:42:41.37,">> You want me to step out? I mean, I'll do it. I'll do it."
728,00:42:49.47,00:42:49.47,>> I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely
729,00:42:51.47,00:42:51.47,"surprised. My hat's off to 'em, though."
730,00:42:53.80,00:42:53.80,"They got me, they got me good. Um, I learned a lot of things."
731,00:42:57.53,00:42:57.53,An experience is nothing unless you share it with other people
732,00:43:00.43,00:43:00.43,"who you love. Jenn, best of luck."
733,00:43:02.63,00:43:02.63,"I appreciate your friendship out on the island, and, uh, look"
734,00:43:06.93,00:43:06.93,forward to... hanging out soon.
