1,00:00:01.40,00:00:01.40,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33, Jacaré was worried about Matthew's bizarre behavior.
3,00:00:06.37,00:00:06.37,I promise I won't harm anyone.
4,00:00:08.13,00:00:08.13,I don't likethe sight of blood.
5,00:00:09.67,00:00:09.67,Why does he needthe machete so sharp?
6,00:00:11.10,00:00:11.10, I think he's gonna kill us.
7,00:00:12.87,00:00:12.87,PROBST: So Rob pretended to form an alliance with Matthew
8,00:00:15.83,00:00:15.83, for his own protection.
9,00:00:17.60,00:00:17.60,I am taking my lifeinto my hands
10,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50, with the amount of lies that I'm telling him.
11,00:00:21.97,00:00:21.97,PROBST: But Rob's true alliance
12,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50," with Alex, Jenna, Deena and Heidi"
13,00:00:25.87,00:00:25.87, was targeting Dave.
14,00:00:27.90,00:00:27.90,I've had an ax to grindwith Dave for so long.
15,00:00:30.17,00:00:30.17,"He's a show-off, he's arrogant."
16,00:00:32.13,00:00:32.13, I can't take any more.
17,00:00:33.20,00:00:33.20, Dave's got to go.
18,00:00:34.20,00:00:34.20, He's a threat.
19,00:00:35.93,00:00:35.93,PROBST: And when Dave won a muddy reward challenge...
20,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77,Dave wins reward.
21,00:00:40.20,00:00:40.20, ...he chose to share it with Deena to plead his case.
22,00:00:43.50,00:00:43.50,I'm just tryingto salvage myself
23,00:00:46.37,00:00:46.37,to stick aroundas long as possible.
24,00:00:47.77,00:00:47.77,I know.
25,00:00:48.77,00:00:48.77,I'll see what I can do.
26,00:00:51.13,00:00:51.13,PROBST: But the immunity challenge
27,00:00:52.50,00:00:52.50, showed the tribe where they stood with each other.
28,00:00:55.10,00:00:55.10,Boo-yah!
29,00:00:56.40,00:00:56.40, Dave and Matthew were the first eliminated.
30,00:00:58.77,00:00:58.77,Welcome to the morgue.
31,00:01:00.40,00:01:00.40, And it was Jenna who took home immunity.
32,00:01:02.23,00:01:02.23,(cheering)
33,00:01:04.30,00:01:04.30,"Nice job, Jenna."
34,00:01:05.77,00:01:05.77," At Tribal Council, Jacaré's decision was unanimous."
35,00:01:09.40,00:01:09.40,The eighth person voted out andthe first member of our jury:
36,00:01:12.03,00:01:12.03,Dave.
37,00:01:14.90,00:01:14.90,The tribe has spoken.
38,00:01:17.03,00:01:17.03, Eight remain.
39,00:01:18.03,00:01:18.03, Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:30.60,00:02:30.60,(whispers)
41,00:02:43.23,00:02:43.23,(quietly):This is what I had to come
42,00:02:44.80,00:02:44.80,over here to talk to you about.
43,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,I am privyto some information that
44,00:02:49.87,00:02:49.87,there are some femaleswith this tribe that are
45,00:02:54.03,00:02:54.03,somewhat unhappywith the leadership role
46,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60,that Deena has assumed.
47,00:02:59.00,00:02:59.00,"ROB: Every morning, I give Matt"
48,00:03:00.50,00:03:00.50, a debriefing of the wild-goose chases
49,00:03:03.60,00:03:03.60,"I want him to work on for theday, just to keep his mind busy,"
50,00:03:06.43,00:03:06.43, so he doesn't really have any chance
51,00:03:08.03,00:03:08.03, to figure out what's actually going on.
52,00:03:09.60,00:03:09.60,This is veryhighly confidential.
53,00:03:12.47,00:03:12.47,Deena was saying that you arethe biggest threat.
54,00:03:14.63,00:03:14.63,Right. I would assume that.
55,00:03:16.63,00:03:16.63,"I mean, people thoughtI was the biggest threat"
56,00:03:18.17,00:03:18.17,"on, like, day two."
57,00:03:19.27,00:03:19.27,"Yeah, that's true."
58,00:03:20.67,00:03:20.67,ROB: I've been really filling Matt's head
59,00:03:22.30,00:03:22.30," with a lot of crazy stuff,"
60,00:03:23.73,00:03:23.73,and I've been telling himabout how the men are gonna
61,00:03:26.43,00:03:26.43,vote off all the women
62,00:03:28.00,00:03:28.00, and that we need Butch's help.
63,00:03:29.87,00:03:29.87," So, Matt is off on a bunch of wild-goose chases."
64,00:03:33.13,00:03:33.13,Because you're the personI trust most in this tribe.
65,00:03:34.90,00:03:34.90,"Okay, good."
66,00:03:35.90,00:03:35.90,Butch-- I pulled Butch in
67,00:03:37.20,00:03:37.20,"because I think thathe's a, he's a good guy."
68,00:03:39.20,00:03:39.20,"Butch is on, seriously,on a need-to-know basis."
69,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"All right, let's-let's go backbefore anybody misses us."
70,00:03:43.80,00:03:43.80,You go first.I'll go to the bathroom.
71,00:03:45.43,00:03:45.43,All right.
72,00:03:46.60,00:03:46.60,You go that wayand I'll go the other way.
73,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,We gotta be...we gotta be a chain.
74,00:04:02.40,00:04:02.40,A what?
75,00:04:04.37,00:04:04.37,Chain like a chain-link.
76,00:04:06.87,00:04:06.87,"MATTHEW: It's a chain,"
77,00:04:08.33,00:04:08.33, and I'm Butch's link to what's happening.
78,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00," I've told him that I will decide when we speak,"
79,00:04:14.03,00:04:14.03,I will initiateall communication.
80,00:04:16.23,00:04:16.23,I'll decidehow much information he gets.
81,00:04:18.10,00:04:18.10, I am his lifeline.
82,00:04:19.87,00:04:19.87,No one hears anything about ourconversations; they don't exist.
83,00:04:23.20,00:04:23.20,We don't talk about anything.
84,00:04:24.47,00:04:24.47,"No, we don'ttalk about anything."
85,00:04:25.93,00:04:25.93,And I initiateall communication.
86,00:04:27.73,00:04:27.73,You initiate all communication.
87,00:04:30.33,00:04:30.33,I guess it's like a chain.
88,00:04:32.00,00:04:32.00,"You got your big chain,big four together,"
89,00:04:34.10,00:04:34.10,and then you want to beone of those links.
90,00:04:35.97,00:04:35.97,"And you want to bethat, uh, seventh link,"
91,00:04:38.40,00:04:38.40,"then maybe sixth,then maybe five,"
92,00:04:40.40,00:04:40.40,and then maybe...there may be a break
93,00:04:42.23,00:04:42.23,and you can jump in thereand grab on.
94,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,And that's what you wantto be able to do.
95,00:04:46.03,00:04:46.03,"Okay, that's it."
96,00:04:47.57,00:04:47.57,No more talk.
97,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,"ROB: It's funny because it's like,"
98,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,"I tell him what to do,and then he feels like--"
99,00:04:55.90,00:04:55.90,then he goesand tells Butch what to do.
100,00:04:58.40,00:04:58.40,"-(laughter)-Then it's like,"
101,00:05:00.17,00:05:00.17,Butch is like--it's like he's the operative.
102,00:05:02.70,00:05:02.70,"And he's like, he's like,""I told Butch, I said,"
103,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,"Butch, you're ona need-to-know basis."""
104,00:05:08.80,00:05:08.80,(laughter)
105,00:05:13.17,00:05:13.17, The fact of the matter is that Matt is
106,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83, who the group would like to vote out next because we think
107,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"that he's mentally unstable,"
108,00:05:19.53,00:05:19.53,and we're afraidthat he may kill us.
109,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,"So, uh, we're tryingnot to let him know"
110,00:05:24.37,00:05:24.37,he's gonna be voted out.
111,00:05:25.77,00:05:25.77,JENNA: We need to be very cautious
112,00:05:27.30,00:05:27.30,that he does not feel threatenedor he does not
113,00:05:29.27,00:05:29.27,"feel like he needs to kill us,any of us."
114,00:05:31.93,00:05:31.93,Is Matthew a physical threat?
115,00:05:33.57,00:05:33.57,"Yeah, to my safety."
116,00:05:35.63,00:05:35.63,(chuckles)
117,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"Treemail, treemail,here we come."
118,00:05:44.63,00:05:44.63,"-Oh, no!-Oh, no."

124,00:05:58.77,00:05:58.77,-JENNA: Alex.-I would say Matt.
125,00:06:00.23,00:06:00.23,"JENNA:Oh, Matt. Absolutely."
126,00:06:01.53,00:06:01.53,"""Smell the aroma of victory."""
127,00:06:02.87,00:06:02.87,"I don't knowhow good an idea this is,"
128,00:06:04.63,00:06:04.63,to give us a bow and arrow.
129,00:06:06.10,00:06:06.10,What you got there?
130,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,DEENA:Bows and arrows.
131,00:06:10.20,00:06:10.20,Matt's gonna orgasm with this.
132,00:06:11.87,00:06:11.87,"Think these are blow darts, too."
133,00:06:13.97,00:06:13.97,That's good.
134,00:06:15.37,00:06:15.37,MATTHEW: Everyone took one of the weapons for a spin.
135,00:06:18.63,00:06:18.63,"You know, everyone tooka couple shots with the arrows,"

139,00:06:50.43,00:06:50.43,"ROB: Coming into this game, the only spears I knew about were"
140,00:06:53.37,00:06:53.37,Britney and broccoliand asparagus.
141,00:06:56.87,00:06:56.87,Harder than that.
142,00:06:58.90,00:06:58.90,"Do I need to, like,totally put my mouth around it?"
143,00:07:00.90,00:07:00.90,"Yeah, I think so."
144,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,Very good.

151,00:07:19.07,00:07:19.07,"ROB: Matt came to me and said,"
152,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93," ""I'm not gonna try my hardest today"

281,00:12:27.20,00:12:27.20,one of the best things aboutbeing in a coffee bar is what?

294,00:13:14.80,00:13:14.80,out in the jungle.
295,00:13:16.27,00:13:16.27, We had a blast.

307,00:13:36.20,00:13:36.20,(chuckles)
308,00:13:37.70,00:13:37.70,That is so good.
309,00:13:39.33,00:13:39.33,This is so nice.
310,00:13:42.03,00:13:42.03,"To you, for winning."
311,00:13:43.50,00:13:43.50,Thank you very much.
312,00:13:45.27,00:13:45.27,I couldn't have picked a betterperson to spend an afternoon
313,00:13:47.73,00:13:47.73,"-in the Amazon with.-Oh, you are far too kind."
314,00:13:49.93,00:13:49.93,"JENNA: I really, really like Alex, and, uh, it was"
315,00:13:51.73,00:13:51.73," really nice to, like, spend time with him and talk to him."
316,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,"And I was so excitedbecause I love to eat,"
317,00:13:56.43,00:13:56.43,and me and Alexare like bottomless pits.
318,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67, We just stuffed our face.
319,00:14:00.43,00:14:00.43,I'm so thankful.
320,00:14:01.70,00:14:01.70,"Oh, so am I."
321,00:14:03.67,00:14:03.67,So am I.
322,00:14:14.27,00:14:14.27,Ah!
323,00:14:15.97,00:14:15.97,"-Catch something, would you?-I will."
324,00:14:17.50,00:14:17.50,Okay.
325,00:14:18.97,00:14:18.97,I'm in the mood to doabsolutely friggin' ass nothing.
326,00:14:21.33,00:14:21.33,DEENA: Reward challenges are great
327,00:14:23.60,00:14:23.60," when you get maybe a full stomach, whatever."
328,00:14:25.93,00:14:25.93, But it also tells you who's really here to play.
329,00:14:28.67,00:14:28.67," And unfortunately, it sets"
330,00:14:30.53,00:14:30.53,"those people upwith a really bad position,"
331,00:14:35.10,00:14:35.10,à la Alex.
332,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33, He clearly came out
333,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33, as a dominant individual.
334,00:14:42.27,00:14:42.27, And that frightened me.
335,00:14:44.90,00:14:44.90,"Hey, Heidi, I'm going to lay ithere all on the line for you."
336,00:14:47.83,00:14:47.83,How important is it for youto advance in this game?
337,00:14:50.43,00:14:50.43,"Totally, with all my heart."
338,00:14:51.90,00:14:51.90,"All right, well, you tell mehow well you think"
339,00:14:53.70,00:14:53.70,"you're going to be ableto advance if-if, uh,"
340,00:14:55.63,00:14:55.63,Matt or Alex is in this game.
341,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07,Matt's not in the picture.
342,00:14:58.83,00:14:58.83,I understand that.
343,00:14:59.90,00:14:59.90,What if Matt wins immunitytomorrow?
344,00:15:03.73,00:15:03.73,I'm talking aboutAlex versus Butch.
345,00:15:07.37,00:15:07.37,Who do you havea better shot against?
346,00:15:09.13,00:15:09.13,"Well, definitely against Butch."
347,00:15:10.57,00:15:10.57,"So, it seems to me,"
348,00:15:13.30,00:15:13.30,"if Matt wins immunity,then Alex has to go."
349,00:15:21.37,00:15:21.37,Wow!
350,00:15:22.37,00:15:22.37,"There you go, dear."
351,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,-Thank you.-You're welcome.
352,00:15:24.70,00:15:24.70,Any special way to drink this?
353,00:15:26.53,00:15:26.53,-Well...-We'll just get amped.
354,00:15:28.47,00:15:28.47,"Yeah, we're going to bezinging out of our heads,"
355,00:15:29.97,00:15:29.97,"and when we come down, like, inthe middle of the night tonight,"
356,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,"we're just going to be, like,""Oh, my God, I'm gonna die."""
357,00:15:34.73,00:15:34.73,(chuckles)
358,00:15:36.27,00:15:36.27,"Yeah, we could actually, like,just sit here and not have to"
359,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,worry about anybodyoverhearing our conversations
360,00:15:39.33,00:15:39.33,and just hang out and...
361,00:15:40.77,00:15:40.77,And actually talk about peoplewithout having to run away.
362,00:15:42.60,00:15:42.60,Mm-hmm.
363,00:15:43.60,00:15:43.60,I would've never expected this
364,00:15:44.87,00:15:44.87,when I started this game.
365,00:15:46.33,00:15:46.33,What?
366,00:15:47.37,00:15:47.37,"To meet, like, such cool people."
367,00:15:49.00,00:15:49.00,Yeah.
368,00:15:50.20,00:15:50.20,You and Heidi and Robare just so much fun.
369,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,"It's funny 'cause, like,us four are, like,"
370,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,"like, the bonding crew."
371,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,Totally.
372,00:15:59.63,00:15:59.63,I wonder if Deena knows it.
373,00:16:01.47,00:16:01.47,I don't knowwhere Deena's at anymore.
374,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,"I don't, either."
375,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,"And, like, I-I..."
376,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"I've been, like,known her since day one."
377,00:16:07.90,00:16:07.90,-Mm-hmm. -And I don't knowwhere she's at.
378,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,It's hard for herto get along with us
379,00:16:12.23,00:16:12.23,"because she doesn't have thesame-- like, she's very strict."
380,00:16:15.67,00:16:15.67,She's not that mucholder than me.
381,00:16:17.07,00:16:17.07,-She's three years olderthan me. -But it seems like
382,00:16:18.93,00:16:18.93,"-an eternity.-But she's, like-- Yeah."
383,00:16:20.33,00:16:20.33,She's so different than me.
384,00:16:21.60,00:16:21.60,"She just seems to be,like, trying to, like--"
385,00:16:24.10,00:16:24.10,"even thinking of, like, anotherangle or plot or something."
386,00:16:26.23,00:16:26.23,Yeah. Yeah.
387,00:16:28.60,00:16:28.60,We all have a chanceagainst one another if it's us.
388,00:16:31.43,00:16:31.43,-Yeah.-We don't have a chance
389,00:16:33.13,00:16:33.13,-if Alex is in this game.-Yeah.
390,00:16:35.10,00:16:35.10,I think that the wisest moveis to get rid of
391,00:16:37.63,00:16:37.63,the equal powerhouse.
392,00:16:39.10,00:16:39.10,ROB: I have a alliance to the end with Deena.
393,00:16:42.27,00:16:42.27, That is a secret.
394,00:16:43.27,00:16:43.27," The other players,"
395,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,"I don't believe,have any clue that Deena and I"
396,00:16:46.47,00:16:46.47,have been working togetherand are so close.
397,00:16:48.07,00:16:48.07,Do you think that Jennawould agree to that?
398,00:16:49.53,00:16:49.53,Yes. I don't havea problem with Jenna.
399,00:16:51.63,00:16:51.63,I just need to finesse that.
400,00:16:53.13,00:16:53.13,"So I will let you knowwhen it's,"
401,00:16:54.50,00:16:54.50,when it's time to talk to Jenna.
402,00:16:55.77,00:16:55.77,ROB: So it was settled.
403,00:16:57.57,00:16:57.57," If Matt won immunity,"
404,00:16:59.77,00:16:59.77,Alex had to go.
405,00:17:01.30,00:17:01.30,They're there.
406,00:17:02.83,00:17:02.83,"Yeah, they are."
407,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,Uh-oh.
408,00:17:05.53,00:17:05.53,Did you get it stuck?
409,00:17:06.87,00:17:06.87,I either got a biteor something's caught.
410,00:17:09.70,00:17:09.70,"DEENA: I feel as if we're in control, Rob and I."
411,00:17:11.57,00:17:11.57," Ultimately, I'm in control, you know, 'cause I always"
412,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,have a backup planafter my backup plan fails.
413,00:17:17.60,00:17:17.60,"You have to bethinking 24/7 here,"
414,00:17:19.90,00:17:19.90,and it's making my head hurt.
415,00:17:22.67,00:17:22.67,This is getting so interesting.
416,00:17:29.47,00:17:29.47,I'm so full.
417,00:17:31.53,00:17:31.53,"Me, too."
418,00:17:32.97,00:17:32.97,"(groans)I'm not worried about, uh,"
419,00:17:35.20,00:17:35.20,I'm not worried about eatingany manioc when I get home.
420,00:17:36.93,00:17:36.93,No.
421,00:17:38.20,00:17:38.20,"JENNA: I think I drank four iced coffees,"
422,00:17:40.87,00:17:40.87, and we both had a cappuccino and then
423,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33, Alex had one more iced coffee.
424,00:17:43.93,00:17:43.93,(slurping)
425,00:17:45.30,00:17:45.30,"That's a lot of coffeein a short amount of time,"
426,00:17:47.43,00:17:47.43,so we-we were buzzing.
427,00:17:58.87,00:17:58.87,Let's eat a lot of manioc.
428,00:18:00.27,00:18:00.27,Okay.
429,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,I'm so hungry.
430,00:18:02.50,00:18:02.50,I know.
431,00:18:03.93,00:18:03.93,"Yes, the fun never stopshere in the Amazon."
432,00:18:06.67,00:18:06.67,"Hey, how are you guys?"
433,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67,How are you?
434,00:18:09.67,00:18:09.67,"Oh, we missed you."
435,00:18:12.43,00:18:12.43,We have an announcement.
436,00:18:13.90,00:18:13.90,"Um, first off,"
437,00:18:15.40,00:18:15.40,"Jenna and I would like to, uh,say that we're more than willing"
438,00:18:19.47,00:18:19.47,to take at least the first twofire watch shifts 'cause
439,00:18:22.47,00:18:22.47,her four cups of coffeeand my five
440,00:18:24.53,00:18:24.53,pretty much guarantees no sleepfor quite some time.
441,00:18:27.73,00:18:27.73,"-Yada, yada, yada.-But if you could all"
442,00:18:29.57,00:18:29.57,just take a seatover here for a minute.
443,00:18:32.80,00:18:32.80,"Um, good thing about being"
444,00:18:34.97,00:18:34.97,-(cheering)-at the cafe
445,00:18:37.30,00:18:37.30,is that cookiescan actually travel.
446,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,So everybody gets two cookies.
447,00:18:42.00,00:18:42.00,They kind of broke.
448,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"That's all we could make,"
449,00:18:44.57,00:18:44.57,that's all we couldmake it out of there with.
450,00:18:46.57,00:18:46.57,But I wanted to make sure thatthere was some for everybody.
451,00:18:48.70,00:18:48.70,Thank you.
452,00:18:49.70,00:18:49.70,-Thanks.-So enjoy them.
453,00:18:51.93,00:18:51.93,"Enjoy them, my friends."
454,00:18:53.03,00:18:53.03,"I'd just like to say,for the record,"
455,00:18:54.30,00:18:54.30,-that I don't approve of this.-Okay.
456,00:18:55.90,00:18:55.90,(laughter)
457,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,ROB: When Alex and Jenna came back from
458,00:18:59.87,00:18:59.87," the reward challenge, they brought back two cookies"
459,00:19:02.40,00:19:02.40,"for each of us,which was a very nice gesture"
460,00:19:05.13,00:19:05.13,and much appreciatedby the tribe.
461,00:19:06.97,00:19:06.97,"But Matt and Butchwere in the boat,"
462,00:19:08.83,00:19:08.83,and they didn't knowthere were any cookies.
463,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,"There's, uh, there'sa little bit there"
464,00:19:12.20,00:19:12.20,for the two of them to grub on.
465,00:19:13.53,00:19:13.53,"Yeah, there's two cookies there."
466,00:19:15.30,00:19:15.30,We could eat all the cookies.
467,00:19:16.50,00:19:16.50,"Hey, hey-- ♪ La, la, la,la, la, la, la... ♪"
468,00:19:19.70,00:19:19.70,I was very fair.
469,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,ROB: I thought that we could just eat the cookies
470,00:19:23.70,00:19:23.70,and Matt and Butchwouldn't know.
471,00:19:25.60,00:19:25.60,"I mean, they're really on theoutside looking in, power-wise."
472,00:19:28.70,00:19:28.70,"Even if they found out,what are they going to do?"
473,00:19:32.93,00:19:32.93,Oh. Son of a...
474,00:19:36.50,00:19:36.50,"Man, I want to catchsome ... damn fish."
475,00:19:39.43,00:19:39.43,BUTCH: Matt and I have been trying to catch fish.
476,00:19:41.30,00:19:41.30, And we caught 12 fish the first day we were here.
477,00:19:44.33,00:19:44.33," The next day, we caught six fish."
478,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80, We caught one this morning.
479,00:19:46.97,00:19:46.97,We fished for three hours.
480,00:19:48.10,00:19:48.10,"It got so hot out there,we could hardly take it."
481,00:19:50.07,00:19:50.07,Here we go.
482,00:19:53.50,00:19:53.50,"Oh, oh."
483,00:19:56.20,00:19:56.20,"Dude, he took my bait."
484,00:19:57.40,00:19:57.40,The bastard.
485,00:19:58.47,00:19:58.47,Got something going here.
486,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90,Got him.
487,00:20:03.57,00:20:03.57,-Got one.-Bring it in.
488,00:20:05.17,00:20:05.17,"Good job, dude."
489,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,Got him.
490,00:20:08.27,00:20:08.27,Awesome.
491,00:20:09.70,00:20:09.70,"Nice... Nice-size piranha, dude."
492,00:20:13.10,00:20:13.10,Piranhas have real sharp teethand they're really long.
493,00:20:16.20,00:20:16.20," I had one on the boat, and I stabbed him in the head"
494,00:20:18.90,00:20:18.90," two times with my knife, hadalready cut him all the way up,"
495,00:20:22.10,00:20:22.10, and I was getting readyto turn him over to skin him...
496,00:20:25.03,00:20:25.03,Ow! Got bit.
497,00:20:26.57,00:20:26.57,Bad?
498,00:20:29.73,00:20:29.73, It hurt. And that fish was dead.
499,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17," I don't know, it must have just saw my finger,"
500,00:20:33.30,00:20:33.30, come right around and bit me.
501,00:20:34.73,00:20:34.73," Yeah, that was stupid of me,"
502,00:20:36.13,00:20:36.13,"but I thought the fish was dead,and he had one last bite."
503,00:20:40.17,00:20:40.17,MATTHEW: How bad?
504,00:20:41.43,00:20:41.43,"Eh, he nailed me."
505,00:20:42.77,00:20:42.77,He got me pretty good.
506,00:21:07.70,00:21:07.70,Good news first:we caught fish.
507,00:21:10.57,00:21:10.57,"Bad news:a few small, puny fish."
508,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,-We brought you backsome cookies. -Boo-yah!
509,00:21:15.87,00:21:15.87,"-Oh, you guys are the best, man.-Thank you."
510,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,"I mean, they kind ofdidn't travel well."
511,00:21:20.03,00:21:20.03,Everyone's gotten theirsexcept for the two of you.
512,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60,You got to split this up.
513,00:21:22.83,00:21:22.83,"I'm sorry I could nottake you with me, Matt,"
514,00:21:24.17,00:21:24.17,but I did promise Jenna.
515,00:21:26.00,00:21:26.00,"You know, promises are reallywhat it's all about."
516,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,We'll be right back.We're gonna go to the bathroom.
517,00:21:31.93,00:21:31.93,ROB: Deena had told Heidi not to say anything to Jenna
518,00:21:36.03,00:21:36.03, about Deena's plans to get rid of Alex.
519,00:21:38.80,00:21:38.80, But following
520,00:21:40.10,00:21:40.10,"Alex and Jenna's returnfrom the reward challenge,"
521,00:21:42.83,00:21:42.83, Heidi told Jenna everything.
522,00:21:45.00,00:21:45.00,"(whispering):Yes, I do... I don't know..."
523,00:21:47.33,00:21:47.33,HEIDI: Alex and Jenna were my original alliance.
524,00:21:49.40,00:21:49.40, I'm not going to turn my back on them.
525,00:21:51.33,00:21:51.33," So, I mean, I just told Jenna about it,"
526,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,and I knew she'dspeak to Alex about it.
527,00:21:56.03,00:21:56.03,"So, wait,what did Heidi say to you?"
528,00:21:58.80,00:21:58.80,"Heidi said thatshe-she ... turned on us,"
529,00:22:01.77,00:22:01.77,so we needto get her off after Matt.
530,00:22:05.37,00:22:05.37,How did Heidi find this out?
531,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,"I guess, Deena said somethingto her and, like..."
532,00:22:08.83,00:22:08.83,JENNA: Deena stabbed us all in the back
533,00:22:10.57,00:22:10.57, because she's being selfish.
534,00:22:12.10,00:22:12.10, I'm really pissed at her.
535,00:22:13.83,00:22:13.83,She's obviously trouble.
536,00:22:15.10,00:22:15.10,She's starting trouble already.
537,00:22:17.07,00:22:17.07,That doesn't needto happen around the camp.
538,00:22:19.10,00:22:19.10,We still got two days.
539,00:22:20.63,00:22:20.63,"-But I'm-I'm worried about Rob.-Butch, Butch..."
540,00:22:22.20,00:22:22.20,Why would Rob pick her over us?
541,00:22:23.63,00:22:23.63,"Because, see, I knowhe gave her a word."
542,00:22:25.23,00:22:25.23,"ALEX: And so, I grabbed Rob, and I was, like,"
543,00:22:27.13,00:22:27.13,"""Rob, dude, what's going on?"""
544,00:22:28.33,00:22:28.33,"He goes, ""What do you mean?"""
545,00:22:29.67,00:22:29.67,"I was, like,""So, now, I'm on list?"
546,00:22:31.10,00:22:31.10,"I'm-- My head's on the block?"""
547,00:22:32.23,00:22:32.23,"He says, ""How do you know that?"
548,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,"That just happened thisafternoon while you were gone."""
549,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,"I was, like,""Dude, 'cause I'm good."
550,00:22:36.43,00:22:36.43,"I know what's going on."""
551,00:22:37.53,00:22:37.53," And he was, like, ""Yeah."
552,00:22:39.00,00:22:39.00," Deena wants to get rid of Matt next, and then you."""
553,00:22:41.53,00:22:41.53,She wants you donesooner than later.
554,00:22:43.10,00:22:43.10,"Dude, you know what?"
555,00:22:44.47,00:22:44.47,"Here's-Here's my,here's my plan then."
556,00:22:46.13,00:22:46.13,Mm-hmm.
557,00:22:47.40,00:22:47.40,"In two days, we vote off Matt."
558,00:22:49.73,00:22:49.73,"Three days after that,we keep Christy"
559,00:22:52.73,00:22:52.73,and we keep Butchand we get rid of Deena.
560,00:22:56.90,00:22:56.90,ROB: Things have
561,00:22:58.13,00:22:58.13,really gotten interestingover here at Jacaré.
562,00:23:02.37,00:23:02.37," It's Deena versus Alex, and both think that"
563,00:23:06.73,00:23:06.73,they're calling the shotsin this game.
564,00:23:30.97,00:23:30.97,HEIDI: I feel so retarded right now
565,00:23:34.80,00:23:34.80, because of some spider bite.
566,00:23:37.13,00:23:37.13,"Oh, wow."
567,00:23:38.77,00:23:38.77,It's getting bad.
568,00:23:40.90,00:23:40.90,-Can't bend it at all?-Uh-uh.
569,00:23:42.50,00:23:42.50,-What's the status?-I don't know.
570,00:23:44.03,00:23:44.03,"I mean, it just won't bend now."
571,00:23:45.53,00:23:45.53,"Like, I mean, it was sucha sharp pain, I almost lost it."
572,00:23:48.23,00:23:48.23," It started off sore, and itstarted turning black and blue."
573,00:23:51.63,00:23:51.63,I am not even able to touchmy knee without extreme pain.
574,00:23:56.83,00:23:56.83,"I mean, I literallycannot bend it."
575,00:23:59.30,00:23:59.30,Your-Your knee is hot from here.
576,00:24:02.20,00:24:02.20,It-It's... pretty much to here.
577,00:24:03.63,00:24:03.63,You want me to carry you overand put you down over there?
578,00:24:05.77,00:24:05.77,"No, no, I'll-I'll walk."
579,00:24:07.30,00:24:07.30,"ROB: Heidi has been bitten by some insect, and it has now"

581,00:24:14.77,00:24:14.77, so it's very hard for her to walk around.
582,00:24:17.23,00:24:17.23," Hopefully, she'll have it drained."
583,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,Stupid bugs.
584,00:24:21.77,00:24:21.77,(laughs)

826,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,DEENA: The mistake that Alex made at the immunity challenge
827,00:33:05.13,00:33:05.13, was to lose the immunity challenge.
828,00:33:07.47,00:33:07.47, Alex needed to win
829,00:33:08.60,00:33:08.60,to save his heinie.
830,00:33:10.07,00:33:10.07,Didn't happen.
831,00:33:11.40,00:33:11.40, My ass really had to have been on the line today
832,00:33:13.83,00:33:13.83, for me to have eaten that grotesque thing.
833,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13," If everybody is still with me,"
834,00:33:18.30,00:33:18.30,why even try?
835,00:33:20.00,00:33:20.00,So what's going on?
836,00:33:21.87,00:33:21.87,"Um, Alex is, by far,the next in line."
837,00:33:25.70,00:33:25.70,Alex has to go next.
838,00:33:28.73,00:33:28.73,Next.
839,00:33:29.73,00:33:29.73,Okay.
840,00:33:31.00,00:33:31.00,"That's understandable,'cause when..."
841,00:33:32.37,00:33:32.37, I convinced Jenna
842,00:33:34.23,00:33:34.23," Alex is too great of a threat, so he's gone."
843,00:33:38.23,00:33:38.23,"(singsongy):Bye-bye, Alex. Bye-bye, Alex."
844,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,I'm-- we're completelyin control of this.
845,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"Oh, yeah."
846,00:33:43.90,00:33:43.90,"So you're with me, right?"
847,00:33:44.90,00:33:44.90,"-Yeah.-Okay, pinky swear."
848,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,-All right.-So...
849,00:33:49.97,00:33:49.97,JENNA: Deena's been in alliance with me and Alex
850,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83," and Rob and Heidi, but she stabbed us all"
851,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,"in the back, and I am"
852,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,so incredibly disappointedand shocked.
853,00:33:57.63,00:33:57.63,And I can't ever forgive that.
854,00:34:05.33,00:34:05.33,"So, this is the first time I'vebeen pissed off in this game."
855,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,"-Mm-hmm.-You, too?"
856,00:34:09.10,00:34:09.10,I'm just tired ofsitting on those logs all day.
857,00:34:11.13,00:34:11.13,Deena took me asideand talked to me.
858,00:34:13.63,00:34:13.63,What'd she say?
859,00:34:14.90,00:34:14.90,"You know, Alex needs to go next."
860,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,"She wants the final four to beyou, Heidi, Christy and her."
861,00:34:20.00,00:34:20.00,She just wants all the girls--all the guys gone first.
862,00:34:22.90,00:34:22.90,"She told me, quote,""We control this game."""
863,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,"And I was like, hmm,you've said that to everybody."
864,00:34:27.23,00:34:27.23,Mm-hmm.
865,00:34:28.77,00:34:28.77,"She's like, ""I have Rob aroundmy finger and he has Matt."""
866,00:34:33.20,00:34:33.20,So that's where it standsat this point.
867,00:34:36.90,00:34:36.90,"It's just... if Rob turns on us,then we're screwed."
868,00:34:39.93,00:34:39.93,That's true.
869,00:34:41.53,00:34:41.53,...the cat?
870,00:34:43.13,00:34:43.13,Ah!
871,00:34:47.37,00:34:47.37,ROB: I'm sort of in both circles in all this right now.
872,00:34:50.27,00:34:50.27," I get information from Deena and Alex, too,"
873,00:34:53.87,00:34:53.87,"which is sort ofa precarious position to be in,"
874,00:34:56.20,00:34:56.20,'cause it could backfire.
875,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"Alex is a, is a greater threat,only because"
876,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,he's gonna make a power playwith the girls to get rid of us.
877,00:35:03.10,00:35:03.10,Right.
878,00:35:04.37,00:35:04.37,I don't want that to happen.
879,00:35:05.40,00:35:05.40,Okay.
880,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,And you have more control overthe Butch and Matt thing because
881,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,they can be ledin different directions
882,00:35:10.50,00:35:10.50,-to vote for whomever.-Yeah.
883,00:35:12.03,00:35:12.03,"DEENA: Rob is doing his own little work with, uh, Matt,"
884,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80," and Matt, of course, then, will talk with Butch."
885,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33, And so it all kind of--
886,00:35:18.93,00:35:18.93,"our little fingersare out reaching,"
887,00:35:20.40,00:35:20.40,and it's all falling into place.
888,00:35:22.20,00:35:22.20,Girls are playing their part.
889,00:35:24.33,00:35:24.33,(sighs)Whew!
890,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,So... we'll do it.
891,00:35:28.73,00:35:28.73,Do Alex next?
892,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,I think so.
893,00:35:31.30,00:35:31.30,ROB: Deena and Alex both thinkthey have the exact same people
894,00:35:35.60,00:35:35.60, to vote the other one off.
895,00:35:37.40,00:35:37.40, And both think that their plan
896,00:35:39.10,00:35:39.10, is going to work without a hitch.
897,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,"It's like we're in the Mob,and that there's gonna be a hit"
898,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,"on one of my friends,and I really have to look"
899,00:35:47.90,00:35:47.90,the other way and act likeeverything's hunky-dory.
900,00:35:50.87,00:35:50.87,"But when we go toTribal Council tonight,"
901,00:35:53.73,00:35:53.73,the one personthat's gonna get the hit tonight
902,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,is gonna be the personthat least expects it.
903,00:36:23.87,00:36:23.87,Welcome to Tribal Council.
904,00:36:27.63,00:36:27.63,We'll now bring inthe first member of our jury.
905,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,Dave is here only to observe.
906,00:36:33.00,00:36:33.00,Just gathering information tohelp in a very important vote.
907,00:36:40.70,00:36:40.70,"Heidi, what the heckis going on with your knee?"
908,00:36:43.57,00:36:43.57,(laughs):I wish I knew.
909,00:36:45.60,00:36:45.60,"I mean,it's getting better, though."
910,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,"It's getting better,and I think honestly,"
911,00:36:48.73,00:36:48.73,"probably in two days,I-I'll be good to go."
912,00:36:50.73,00:36:50.73,Did it concern you at all?
913,00:36:52.07,00:36:52.07,"-I mean, this isan individual game. -Yes!"
914,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,"Oh, my gosh, yes."
915,00:36:54.93,00:36:54.93,"I'm sitting here,okay, my strongest"
916,00:36:56.87,00:36:56.87,assets to this group are
917,00:36:58.97,00:36:58.97,athletic abilityand intelligence.
918,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,"And, hello, one of thoseis gone right now."
919,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,-Which one?-(laughter)
920,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,"Well, uh, that'sa very good question."
921,00:37:10.07,00:37:10.07,"Deena, now that we are inthe jury phase of this game,"
922,00:37:13.27,00:37:13.27,have you noticedany palpable change in the game?
923,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,Game is on.
924,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,People are jockeyingfor positions.
925,00:37:21.27,00:37:21.27,There is a struggle for--and I wouldn't say power--
926,00:37:24.30,00:37:24.30,but there's a struggleto see who has power.
927,00:37:26.07,00:37:26.07,You bet. Absolutely a change.
928,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,People are a little on edge.
929,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,It's no longer aboutsurvival in the Amazon.
930,00:37:32.23,00:37:32.23,It's survivalin the Survivor game.
931,00:37:35.40,00:37:35.40,"Alex, you start to notice,"
932,00:37:37.73,00:37:37.73,"or maybe think you're noticing,people whispering"
933,00:37:40.23,00:37:40.23,or pairing off a little moreoften than they used to?
934,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,"To some extent, sure."
935,00:37:44.27,00:37:44.27,You can't help but geta little bit paranoid.
936,00:37:46.60,00:37:46.60,"And you start asking yourselfquestions about, like,"
937,00:37:49.07,00:37:49.07,whether or not ethicsenters into the game or not.
938,00:37:51.90,00:37:51.90,Do you stab someone in the back?
939,00:37:53.43,00:37:53.43,"It's a balancing act, for sure."
940,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,See what happens.
941,00:37:57.60,00:37:57.60,"Matthew, how importantwas immunity for you to have?"
942,00:38:00.77,00:38:00.77,"Immunity was a nice thingto have today,"
943,00:38:04.23,00:38:04.23,"but for me, uh, personally,based on what I know"
944,00:38:08.13,00:38:08.13,"about the tribeand, uh, feelings"
945,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"and the mood of the tribe,"
946,00:38:11.87,00:38:11.87,"it wasn't, uh,absolutely essential."
947,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,Hmm. So are you willingto negotiate for it?
948,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,No.
949,00:38:18.37,00:38:18.37,(laughter)
950,00:38:19.93,00:38:19.93,"Alex, how nice would it be"
951,00:38:21.60,00:38:21.60,for you to havethat necklace tonight?
952,00:38:23.37,00:38:23.37,I'd love to have that necklace.
953,00:38:24.90,00:38:24.90,I want to finish this game.
954,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,I want to win this game.
955,00:38:28.03,00:38:28.03,"I don't get into competitionsto go, ""Eh, that's cool."
956,00:38:30.63,00:38:30.63,"I'm done now."""
957,00:38:31.63,00:38:31.63,It's not why I do it.
958,00:38:32.90,00:38:32.90,"And if my name comes up,well, then my name comes up."
959,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,I don't haveany control over it.
960,00:38:38.83,00:38:38.83,"Deena, feel good abouthow you played the game?"
961,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,"Thus far, yes."
962,00:38:41.87,00:38:41.87,"If my name comes up, it wouldhave come down to a bug."
963,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"I mean, essentially,"
964,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,"okay, spawned out ofthe pit of hell,"
965,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"but that thing-- that's whatseparates Matt and I,"
966,00:38:50.13,00:38:50.13,"is swallowingone giant, ugly grub."
967,00:38:54.03,00:38:54.03,It is time to vote.
968,00:38:56.27,00:38:56.27,"Christy, you're first."
969,00:39:07.60,00:39:07.60,"I vote for Alex tonight,"
970,00:39:09.10,00:39:09.10,"because he's a serious threatto the tribe,"
971,00:39:11.57,00:39:11.57,so I'm tryingto get rid of him tonight.
972,00:39:26.90,00:39:26.90,"You lied to me, you betrayed me,you screwed me."
973,00:39:29.70,00:39:29.70,Now screw you.
974,00:39:39.30,00:39:39.30,"'Cause you are a mentaland physical powerhouse,"
975,00:39:41.87,00:39:41.87,you're standing between meand the big prize.
976,00:39:57.50,00:39:57.50,"Deena, you couldn't even stickby your word for three days."
977,00:40:00.80,00:40:00.80,"I'd actually love to go upagainst you in court any day,"
978,00:40:03.30,00:40:03.30,'cause you're the worst liar Ithink I've ever met in my life.
979,00:40:33.00,00:40:33.00,I'll go tally the votes.
980,00:40:45.03,00:40:45.03,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
981,00:40:47.17,00:40:47.17,Person voted out will be asked
982,00:40:48.60,00:40:48.60,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
983,00:40:50.30,00:40:50.30,I'll read the votes.
984,00:40:54.87,00:40:54.87,First vote:
985,00:40:56.70,00:40:56.70,Deena.
986,00:41:03.27,00:41:03.27,Deena.
987,00:41:04.30,00:41:04.30,Two votes Deena.
988,00:41:08.63,00:41:08.63,Alex.
989,00:41:13.50,00:41:13.50,Alex.
990,00:41:15.07,00:41:15.07,"Two votes Alex, two votes Deena."
991,00:41:20.27,00:41:20.27,Three votes Deena.
992,00:41:25.07,00:41:25.07,"That's four votes Deena,two votes Alex."
993,00:41:31.13,00:41:31.13,"Ninth person voted out,the second member of our jury:"
994,00:41:34.37,00:41:34.37,Deena.
995,00:41:35.90,00:41:35.90,"That's five, and that's enough."
996,00:41:37.43,00:41:37.43,Need to bring me your torch.
997,00:41:39.43,00:41:39.43,No need to read the last vote.
998,00:41:50.27,00:41:50.27,"Deena, the tribe has spoken."
999,00:41:54.90,00:41:54.90,It's time for you to go.
1000,00:42:08.90,00:42:08.90,"Well, you've survivednine Tribal Councils,"
1001,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,lasted 27 days.
1002,00:42:13.97,00:42:13.97,You're doing something right.
1003,00:42:15.20,00:42:15.20,These last 12 dayswill raise one very simple
1004,00:42:17.63,00:42:17.63,but important question:How badly do you want it?
1005,00:42:21.60,00:42:21.60,And what will youor won't you do to get it?
1006,00:42:25.80,00:42:25.80,Guys can head back to camp.
1007,00:42:27.37,00:42:27.37,Good night.
1008,00:42:40.90,00:42:40.90, Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
1009,00:42:51.93,00:42:51.93,"They saw me as a threat,and I wanted to change"
1010,00:42:54.07,00:42:54.07,"the, uh, the faceof the game a little bit"
1011,00:42:55.83,00:42:55.83, and vote off the people that were the strongest
1012,00:42:57.63,00:42:57.63, so that we could finish off until the end.
1013,00:42:59.53,00:42:59.53," Things happen, people change their minds,"
1014,00:43:01.70,00:43:01.70,"relationships grow, and there's attachments, so I got nixed."
1015,00:43:05.10,00:43:05.10, But remember that you're going to have to live with
1016,00:43:07.20,00:43:07.20," the decisions for the rest of your life,"
1017,00:43:08.67,00:43:08.67, so make sure that they count.
1018,00:43:09.77,00:43:09.77,Thanks for the ride.
1019,00:43:10.80,00:43:10.80,I had a good time.
