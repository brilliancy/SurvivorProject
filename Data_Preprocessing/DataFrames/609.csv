1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.40,00:00:01.40,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33, Jacar\xc3\xa9 was worried about  Matthew's bizarre behavior.
4,00:00:06.37,00:00:06.37,I promise I won't harm anyone.
5,00:00:08.13,00:00:08.13,I don't like the sight of blood.
6,00:00:09.67,00:00:09.67,Why does he need the machete so sharp?
7,00:00:11.10,00:00:11.10, I think he's gonna kill us.
8,00:00:12.87,00:00:12.87,PROBST: So Rob pretended to form  an alliance with Matthew
9,00:00:15.83,00:00:15.83, for his own protection.
10,00:00:17.60,00:00:17.60,I am taking my life into my hands
11,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50, with the amount of lies  that I'm telling him.
12,00:00:21.97,00:00:21.97,PROBST:  But Rob's true alliance
13,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50," with Alex, Jenna,  Deena and Heidi"
14,00:00:25.87,00:00:25.87, was targeting Dave.
15,00:00:27.90,00:00:27.90,I've had an ax to grind with Dave for so long.
16,00:00:30.17,00:00:30.17,"He's a show-off, he's arrogant."
17,00:00:32.13,00:00:32.13, I can't take any more.
18,00:00:33.20,00:00:33.20, Dave's got to go.
19,00:00:34.20,00:00:34.20, He's a threat.
20,00:00:35.93,00:00:35.93,PROBST: And when Dave won  a muddy reward challenge...
21,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77,Dave wins reward.
22,00:00:40.20,00:00:40.20, ...he chose to share it  with Deena to plead his case.
23,00:00:43.50,00:00:43.50,I'm just trying to salvage myself
24,00:00:46.37,00:00:46.37,to stick around as long as possible.
25,00:00:47.77,00:00:47.77,I know.
26,00:00:48.77,00:00:48.77,I'll see what I can do.
27,00:00:51.13,00:00:51.13,PROBST:  But the immunity challenge
28,00:00:52.50,00:00:52.50, showed the tribe where  they stood with each other.
29,00:00:55.10,00:00:55.10,Boo-yah!
30,00:00:56.40,00:00:56.40, Dave and Matthew  were the first eliminated.
31,00:00:58.77,00:00:58.77,Welcome to the morgue.
32,00:01:00.40,00:01:00.40, And it was Jenna  who took home immunity.
33,00:01:02.23,00:01:02.23,(cheering)
34,00:01:04.30,00:01:04.30,"Nice job, Jenna."
35,00:01:05.77,00:01:05.77," At Tribal Council, Jacar\xc3\xa9's  decision was unanimous."
36,00:01:09.40,00:01:09.40,The eighth person voted out and the first member of our jury:
37,00:01:12.03,00:01:12.03,Dave.
38,00:01:14.90,00:01:14.90,The tribe has spoken.
39,00:01:17.03,00:01:17.03, Eight remain.
40,00:01:18.03,00:01:18.03, Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:30.60,00:02:30.60,(whispers)
42,00:02:43.23,00:02:43.23,(quietly): This is what I had to come
43,00:02:44.80,00:02:44.80,over here to talk to you about.
44,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,I am privy to some information that
45,00:02:49.87,00:02:49.87,there are some females with this tribe that are
46,00:02:54.03,00:02:54.03,somewhat unhappy with the leadership role
47,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60,that Deena has assumed.
48,00:02:59.00,00:02:59.00,"ROB:  Every morning, I give Matt"
49,00:03:00.50,00:03:00.50, a debriefing  of the wild-goose chases
50,00:03:03.60,00:03:03.60,"I want him to work on for the day, just to keep his mind busy,"
51,00:03:06.43,00:03:06.43, so he doesn't really  have any chance
52,00:03:08.03,00:03:08.03, to figure out  what's actually going on.
53,00:03:09.60,00:03:09.60,This is very highly confidential.
54,00:03:12.47,00:03:12.47,Deena was saying that you are the biggest threat.
55,00:03:14.63,00:03:14.63,Right. I would assume that.
56,00:03:16.63,00:03:16.63,"I mean, people thought I was the biggest threat"
57,00:03:18.17,00:03:18.17,"on, like, day two."
58,00:03:19.27,00:03:19.27,"Yeah, that's true."
59,00:03:20.67,00:03:20.67,ROB: I've been really  filling Matt's head
60,00:03:22.30,00:03:22.30," with a lot of crazy stuff,"
61,00:03:23.73,00:03:23.73,and I've been telling him about how the men are gonna
62,00:03:26.43,00:03:26.43,vote off all the women
63,00:03:28.00,00:03:28.00, and that we need Butch's help.
64,00:03:29.87,00:03:29.87," So, Matt is off on a bunch  of wild-goose chases."
65,00:03:33.13,00:03:33.13,Because you're the person I trust most in this tribe.
66,00:03:34.90,00:03:34.90,"Okay, good."
67,00:03:35.90,00:03:35.90,Butch-- I pulled Butch in
68,00:03:37.20,00:03:37.20,"because I think that he's a, he's a good guy."
69,00:03:39.20,00:03:39.20,"Butch is on, seriously, on a need-to-know basis."
70,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"All right, let's-let's go back before anybody misses us."
71,00:03:43.80,00:03:43.80,You go first. I'll go to the bathroom.
72,00:03:45.43,00:03:45.43,All right.
73,00:03:46.60,00:03:46.60,You go that way and I'll go the other way.
74,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,We gotta be... we gotta be a chain.
75,00:04:02.40,00:04:02.40,A what?
76,00:04:04.37,00:04:04.37,Chain like a chain-link.
77,00:04:06.87,00:04:06.87,"MATTHEW:  It's a chain,"
78,00:04:08.33,00:04:08.33, and I'm Butch's link  to what's happening.
79,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00," I've told him that  I will decide when we speak,"
80,00:04:14.03,00:04:14.03,I will initiate all communication.
81,00:04:16.23,00:04:16.23,I'll decide how much information he gets.
82,00:04:18.10,00:04:18.10, I am his lifeline.
83,00:04:19.87,00:04:19.87,No one hears anything about our conversations; they don't exist.
84,00:04:23.20,00:04:23.20,We don't talk about anything.
85,00:04:24.47,00:04:24.47,"No, we don't talk about anything."
86,00:04:25.93,00:04:25.93,And I initiate all communication.
87,00:04:27.73,00:04:27.73,You initiate all communication.
88,00:04:30.33,00:04:30.33,I guess it's like a chain.
89,00:04:32.00,00:04:32.00,"You got your big chain, big four together,"
90,00:04:34.10,00:04:34.10,and then you want to be one of those links.
91,00:04:35.97,00:04:35.97,"And you want to be that, uh, seventh link,"
92,00:04:38.40,00:04:38.40,"then maybe sixth, then maybe five,"
93,00:04:40.40,00:04:40.40,and then maybe... there may be a break
94,00:04:42.23,00:04:42.23,and you can jump in there and grab on.
95,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,And that's what you want to be able to do.
96,00:04:46.03,00:04:46.03,"Okay, that's it."
97,00:04:47.57,00:04:47.57,No more talk.
98,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,"ROB:  It's funny because it's like,"
99,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,"I tell him what to do, and then he feels like--"
100,00:04:55.90,00:04:55.90,then he goes and tells Butch what to do.
101,00:04:58.40,00:04:58.40,"-(laughter) -Then it's like,"
102,00:05:00.17,00:05:00.17,Butch is like-- it's like he's the operative.
103,00:05:02.70,00:05:02.70,"And he's like, he's like, ""I told Butch, I said,"
104,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,"Butch, you're on a need-to-know basis."""
105,00:05:08.80,00:05:08.80,(laughter)
106,00:05:13.17,00:05:13.17, The fact of the matter  is that Matt is
107,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83, who the group would like to  vote out next because we think
108,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"that he's mentally unstable,"
109,00:05:19.53,00:05:19.53,and we're afraid that he may kill us.
110,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,"So, uh, we're trying not to let him know"
111,00:05:24.37,00:05:24.37,he's gonna be voted out.
112,00:05:25.77,00:05:25.77,JENNA:  We need to be very cautious
113,00:05:27.30,00:05:27.30,that he does not feel threatened or he does not
114,00:05:29.27,00:05:29.27,"feel like he needs to kill us, any of us."
115,00:05:31.93,00:05:31.93,Is Matthew a physical threat?
116,00:05:33.57,00:05:33.57,"Yeah, to my safety."
117,00:05:35.63,00:05:35.63,(chuckles)
118,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"Treemail, treemail, here we come."
119,00:05:44.63,00:05:44.63,"-Oh, no! -Oh, no."
120,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"""Practice, practice, practice, Don't compete in haste,"
121,00:05:50.20,00:05:50.20,"Smell the aroma of victory, Get Brazil's most famous taste."""
122,00:05:54.73,00:05:54.73,Coffee?
123,00:05:55.90,00:05:55.90,"You're right, ""the aroma of victory."""
124,00:05:57.33,00:05:57.33,You know who's gonna win?
125,00:05:58.77,00:05:58.77,-JENNA: Alex. -I would say Matt.
126,00:06:00.23,00:06:00.23,"JENNA: Oh, Matt. Absolutely."
127,00:06:01.53,00:06:01.53,"""Smell the aroma of victory."""
128,00:06:02.87,00:06:02.87,"I don't know how good an idea this is,"
129,00:06:04.63,00:06:04.63,to give us a bow and arrow.
130,00:06:06.10,00:06:06.10,What you got there?
131,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,DEENA: Bows and arrows.
132,00:06:10.20,00:06:10.20,Matt's gonna orgasm with this.
133,00:06:11.87,00:06:11.87,"Think these are blow darts, too."
134,00:06:13.97,00:06:13.97,That's good.
135,00:06:15.37,00:06:15.37,MATTHEW: Everyone took  one of the weapons for a spin.
136,00:06:18.63,00:06:18.63,"You know, everyone took a couple shots with the arrows,"
137,00:06:21.37,00:06:21.37,couple throws with the spear
138,00:06:23.70,00:06:23.70, and blew a couple darts.
139,00:06:40.83,00:06:40.83,Not bad.
140,00:06:50.43,00:06:50.43,"ROB: Coming into this game, the  only spears I knew about were"
141,00:06:53.37,00:06:53.37,Britney and broccoli and asparagus.
142,00:06:56.87,00:06:56.87,Harder than that.
143,00:06:58.90,00:06:58.90,"Do I need to, like, totally put my mouth around it?"
144,00:07:00.90,00:07:00.90,"Yeah, I think so."
145,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,Very good.
146,00:07:08.10,00:07:08.10,"Matt, I really-- I think you got this one in the bag."
147,00:07:11.10,00:07:11.10,Not necessarily.
148,00:07:12.10,00:07:12.10,What do you think?
149,00:07:13.93,00:07:13.93,"I think, I think you're 100% right."
150,00:07:15.77,00:07:15.77,"If I was in your situation,"
151,00:07:17.40,00:07:17.40,"I'd be thinking the same, the same way."
152,00:07:19.07,00:07:19.07,"ROB:  Matt came to me and said,"
153,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93," ""I'm not gonna  try my hardest today"
154,00:07:23.57,00:07:23.57," because I don't want people to  think I'm a physical threat."""
155,00:07:25.93,00:07:25.93,"And I said, ""Matt, I think you're finally"
156,00:07:29.23,00:07:29.23,"starting to understand this game."""
157,00:07:30.80,00:07:30.80,"You are, you are figuring this game out."
158,00:07:33.07,00:07:33.07,"Good. I'm learning, man."
159,00:07:36.80,00:07:36.80,"Ow, that one hit my hand."
160,00:07:38.40,00:07:38.40,You okay?
161,00:07:46.03,00:07:46.03,"Come on down, guys."
162,00:07:47.17,00:07:47.17,Everybody good?

208,00:09:46.67,00:09:46.67,Rob and Christy at three.
209,00:09:48.30,00:09:48.30,Alex.
210,00:09:49.97,00:09:49.97,"Nice and slow, dude."
211,00:09:55.10,00:09:55.10,-Nice shot. Seven. -Ooh. Good job.
212,00:09:57.43,00:09:57.43,"With that, Alex moves into second place."
213,00:09:59.13,00:09:59.13,Matthew's still in the lead at ten points.
214,00:10:00.70,00:10:00.70,Jenna.
215,00:10:06.13,00:10:06.13,-Oh! -Three.
216,00:10:07.50,00:10:07.50,That's okay.
217,00:10:08.50,00:10:08.50,"-Good job. -Good job, Jenna."
218,00:10:09.67,00:10:09.67,"-Thank you, guys. -Deena."
219,00:10:13.30,00:10:13.30,And five.
220,00:10:14.40,00:10:14.40,Here's our countdown:
221,00:10:16.37,00:10:16.37,"Matt has ten, Alex at seven, Butch and Deena tied at five."
222,00:10:20.67,00:10:20.67,"That knocks Jenna out, along with Christy and Rob."
223,00:10:23.40,00:10:23.40,Heidi.
224,00:10:24.47,00:10:24.47,Gonna take a five to keep you alive.
225,00:10:29.90,00:10:29.90,-That's not a five. -Mm.
226,00:10:31.13,00:10:31.13,-Nope. -Zip.
227,00:10:32.53,00:10:32.53,"-Good try. -That's okay. -Good try, Heidi."
228,00:10:34.23,00:10:34.23,"Matt, Alex, Butch and Deena moving on to round two."
229,00:10:37.23,00:10:37.23,You will throw spears.
230,00:10:38.70,00:10:38.70,The two closest to the bull's-eye
231,00:10:40.50,00:10:40.50,moves on to the next round.
232,00:10:42.23,00:10:42.23,"Matthew, you drew first this time."
233,00:10:50.43,00:10:50.43,That'll work.
234,00:10:51.50,00:10:51.50,"(cheering, shouting)"
235,00:10:52.60,00:10:52.60,"Wow, that's gonna be tough to beat."
236,00:10:55.13,00:10:55.13,"Deena, you're up."
237,00:10:56.30,00:10:56.30,Take your first shot. The two closest move on.
238,00:11:00.90,00:11:00.90,(Deena blows a raspberry)
239,00:11:02.00,00:11:02.00,No score for Deena.
240,00:11:03.23,00:11:03.23,That's okay.
241,00:11:04.47,00:11:04.47,"-It's all right, D. -You made it this far."
242,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67,Butch.
243,00:11:07.23,00:11:07.23,"Did okay with the blow darts, see how you do with the spear."
244,00:11:15.07,00:11:15.07,That'll work.
245,00:11:16.83,00:11:16.83,Butch on the board.
246,00:11:18.20,00:11:18.20,"All right, Alex."
247,00:11:19.87,00:11:19.87,"Come on, Alex."
248,00:11:20.87,00:11:20.87,"Let's go, Alex."
249,00:11:21.87,00:11:21.87,Gotta get inside the green.
250,00:11:23.10,00:11:23.10,Count.
251,00:11:29.30,00:11:29.30,"-Yeah, baby! -Good job. -That'll work."
252,00:11:30.63,00:11:30.63,Alex and Matthew moving on to the final round.
253,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,I'll take it.
254,00:11:33.33,00:11:33.33,"Good job, guys."
255,00:11:34.60,00:11:34.60,"Let's go, dude."
256,00:11:35.60,00:11:35.60,"You and me, baby."
257,00:11:36.60,00:11:36.60,Moving on to the bow and arrow round.
258,00:11:38.43,00:11:38.43,You guys keep it here on the bench.
259,00:11:40.07,00:11:40.07,"Matt, Alex, join me in the tower."
260,00:11:44.00,00:11:44.00,"Here we go, Matthew."
261,00:11:45.37,00:11:45.37,Take your shot.
262,00:11:49.37,00:11:49.37,Not bad.
263,00:11:50.87,00:11:50.87,Alex.
264,00:11:53.37,00:11:53.37,This guy is a nincompoop.
265,00:11:59.70,00:11:59.70,"Alex, you're going to have to hit it in the yellow,"
266,00:12:01.87,00:12:01.87,red or black to win.
267,00:12:05.23,00:12:05.23,-And he does. -Whoo!
268,00:12:06.77,00:12:06.77,-Boo-yah! -Alex is drinking coffee.
269,00:12:07.87,00:12:07.87,"-Good job, dude. -Yes."
270,00:12:09.30,00:12:09.30,"Good job, buddy. Well done."
271,00:12:10.63,00:12:10.63,-Nice job. -Thank you.
272,00:12:11.63,00:12:11.63,Alex!
273,00:12:12.67,00:12:12.67,"(cheering, applause)"
274,00:12:13.80,00:12:13.80,"Oh, yeah!"
275,00:12:16.90,00:12:16.90,"Alex, congratulations, dude."
276,00:12:18.27,00:12:18.27,"Thank you, my brother."
277,00:12:19.40,00:12:19.40,"-Good job. Good job. -Hey, that was good."
278,00:12:20.63,00:12:20.63,"-Good competition. -Guys, come on up."
279,00:12:22.07,00:12:22.07,"Matthew, you can join them."
280,00:12:24.03,00:12:24.03,"All right, Alex, so we have this Amazon coffee bar."
281,00:12:25.47,00:12:25.47,"-Oh, yeah. -But of course,"
282,00:12:27.20,00:12:27.20,one of the best things about being in a coffee bar is what?
283,00:12:29.53,00:12:29.53,-Hanging out with somebody. -Hanging out with your friends.
284,00:12:31.10,00:12:31.10,-Yeah. One friend. -Absolutely.
285,00:12:32.70,00:12:32.70,"So, Jenna, let's go have some coffee."
286,00:12:34.60,00:12:34.60,-Jenna gets her wish. -(Jenna shrieking)
287,00:12:35.60,00:12:35.60,(Alex laughs)
288,00:12:37.20,00:12:37.20,"Guys, nice competition."
289,00:12:38.97,00:12:38.97,Sorry. You can head back to camp.
290,00:13:00.77,00:13:00.77,Let me present to you your home for the next few hours.
291,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,-Wow. -Nice! -The Amazon Cafe.
292,00:13:06.23,00:13:06.23,-Very nice. -Very nice.
293,00:13:10.13,00:13:10.13,ALEX: Going to the coffeehouse  was awesome.
294,00:13:12.00,00:13:12.00,"It was this cool little structure out in the,"
295,00:13:14.80,00:13:14.80,out in the jungle.
296,00:13:16.27,00:13:16.27, We had a blast.
297,00:13:17.27,00:13:17.27,"Guys, here's to surviving"
298,00:13:18.40,00:13:18.40,-25 days in the Amazon. -Thank you.
299,00:13:19.83,00:13:19.83,Right on.
300,00:13:21.33,00:13:21.33,Everything here is yours.
301,00:13:22.37,00:13:22.37,Have a good afternoon.
302,00:13:23.43,00:13:23.43,"-Later, guys. -Thanks, Jeff. See ya."
303,00:13:25.63,00:13:25.63,"Oh, my God."
304,00:13:27.40,00:13:27.40,Mm-hmm.
305,00:13:29.00,00:13:29.00,(grunts)
306,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,I'm so happy right now.
307,00:13:35.13,00:13:35.13,This is so cool.
308,00:13:36.20,00:13:36.20,(chuckles)
309,00:13:37.70,00:13:37.70,That is so good.
310,00:13:39.33,00:13:39.33,This is so nice.
311,00:13:42.03,00:13:42.03,"To you, for winning."
312,00:13:43.50,00:13:43.50,Thank you very much.
313,00:13:45.27,00:13:45.27,I couldn't have picked a better person to spend an afternoon
314,00:13:47.73,00:13:47.73,"-in the Amazon with. -Oh, you are far too kind."
315,00:13:49.93,00:13:49.93,"JENNA: I really, really  like Alex, and, uh, it was"
316,00:13:51.73,00:13:51.73," really nice to, like, spend  time with him and talk to him."
317,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,"And I was so excited because I love to eat,"
318,00:13:56.43,00:13:56.43,and me and Alex are like bottomless pits.
319,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67, We just stuffed our face.
320,00:14:00.43,00:14:00.43,I'm so thankful.
321,00:14:01.70,00:14:01.70,"Oh, so am I."
322,00:14:03.67,00:14:03.67,So am I.
323,00:14:14.27,00:14:14.27,Ah!
324,00:14:15.97,00:14:15.97,"-Catch something, would you? -I will."
325,00:14:17.50,00:14:17.50,Okay.
326,00:14:18.97,00:14:18.97,I'm in the mood to do absolutely friggin' ass nothing.
327,00:14:21.33,00:14:21.33,DEENA:  Reward challenges are great
328,00:14:23.60,00:14:23.60," when you get maybe  a full stomach, whatever."
329,00:14:25.93,00:14:25.93, But it also tells you  who's really here to play.
330,00:14:28.67,00:14:28.67," And unfortunately, it sets"
331,00:14:30.53,00:14:30.53,"those people up with a really bad position,"
332,00:14:35.10,00:14:35.10,\xc3\xa0 la Alex.
333,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33, He clearly came out
334,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33, as a dominant individual.
335,00:14:42.27,00:14:42.27, And that frightened me.
336,00:14:44.90,00:14:44.90,"Hey, Heidi, I'm going to lay it here all on the line for you."
337,00:14:47.83,00:14:47.83,How important is it for you to advance in this game?
338,00:14:50.43,00:14:50.43,"Totally, with all my heart."
339,00:14:51.90,00:14:51.90,"All right, well, you tell me how well you think"
340,00:14:53.70,00:14:53.70,"you're going to be able to advance if-if, uh,"
341,00:14:55.63,00:14:55.63,Matt or Alex is in this game.
342,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07,Matt's not in the picture.
343,00:14:58.83,00:14:58.83,I understand that.
344,00:14:59.90,00:14:59.90,What if Matt wins immunity tomorrow?
345,00:15:03.73,00:15:03.73,I'm talking about Alex versus Butch.
346,00:15:07.37,00:15:07.37,Who do you have a better shot against?
347,00:15:09.13,00:15:09.13,"Well, definitely against Butch."
348,00:15:10.57,00:15:10.57,"So, it seems to me,"
349,00:15:13.30,00:15:13.30,"if Matt wins immunity, then Alex has to go."
350,00:15:21.37,00:15:21.37,Wow!
351,00:15:22.37,00:15:22.37,"There you go, dear."
352,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
353,00:15:24.70,00:15:24.70,Any special way to drink this?
354,00:15:26.53,00:15:26.53,-Well... -We'll just get amped.
355,00:15:28.47,00:15:28.47,"Yeah, we're going to be zinging out of our heads,"
356,00:15:29.97,00:15:29.97,"and when we come down, like, in the middle of the night tonight,"
357,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,"we're just going to be, like, ""Oh, my God, I'm gonna die."""
358,00:15:34.73,00:15:34.73,(chuckles)
359,00:15:36.27,00:15:36.27,"Yeah, we could actually, like, just sit here and not have to"
360,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,worry about anybody overhearing our conversations
361,00:15:39.33,00:15:39.33,and just hang out and...
362,00:15:40.77,00:15:40.77,And actually talk about people without having to run away.
363,00:15:42.60,00:15:42.60,Mm-hmm.
364,00:15:43.60,00:15:43.60,I would've never expected this
365,00:15:44.87,00:15:44.87,when I started this game.
366,00:15:46.33,00:15:46.33,What?
367,00:15:47.37,00:15:47.37,"To meet, like, such cool people."
368,00:15:49.00,00:15:49.00,Yeah.
369,00:15:50.20,00:15:50.20,You and Heidi and Rob are just so much fun.
370,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,"It's funny 'cause, like, us four are, like,"
371,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,"like, the bonding crew."
372,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,Totally.
373,00:15:59.63,00:15:59.63,I wonder if Deena knows it.
374,00:16:01.47,00:16:01.47,I don't know where Deena's at anymore.
375,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,"I don't, either."
376,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,"And, like, I-I..."
377,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"I've been, like, known her since day one."
378,00:16:07.90,00:16:07.90,-Mm-hmm. -And I don't know where she's at.
379,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,It's hard for her to get along with us
380,00:16:12.23,00:16:12.23,"because she doesn't have the same-- like, she's very strict."
381,00:16:15.67,00:16:15.67,She's not that much older than me.
382,00:16:17.07,00:16:17.07,-She's three years older than me. -But it seems like
383,00:16:18.93,00:16:18.93,"-an eternity. -But she's, like-- Yeah."
384,00:16:20.33,00:16:20.33,She's so different than me.
385,00:16:21.60,00:16:21.60,"She just seems to be, like, trying to, like--"
386,00:16:24.10,00:16:24.10,"even thinking of, like, another angle or plot or something."
387,00:16:26.23,00:16:26.23,Yeah. Yeah.
388,00:16:28.60,00:16:28.60,We all have a chance against one another if it's us.
389,00:16:31.43,00:16:31.43,-Yeah. -We don't have a chance
390,00:16:33.13,00:16:33.13,-if Alex is in this game. -Yeah.
391,00:16:35.10,00:16:35.10,I think that the wisest move is to get rid of
392,00:16:37.63,00:16:37.63,the equal powerhouse.
393,00:16:39.10,00:16:39.10,ROB: I have a alliance  to the end with Deena.
394,00:16:42.27,00:16:42.27, That is a secret.
395,00:16:43.27,00:16:43.27," The other players,"
396,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,"I don't believe, have any clue that Deena and I"
397,00:16:46.47,00:16:46.47,have been working together and are so close.
398,00:16:48.07,00:16:48.07,Do you think that Jenna would agree to that?
399,00:16:49.53,00:16:49.53,Yes. I don't have a problem with Jenna.
400,00:16:51.63,00:16:51.63,I just need to finesse that.
401,00:16:53.13,00:16:53.13,"So I will let you know when it's,"
402,00:16:54.50,00:16:54.50,when it's time to talk to Jenna.
403,00:16:55.77,00:16:55.77,ROB:  So it was settled.
404,00:16:57.57,00:16:57.57," If Matt won immunity,"
405,00:16:59.77,00:16:59.77,Alex had to go.
406,00:17:01.30,00:17:01.30,They're there.
407,00:17:02.83,00:17:02.83,"Yeah, they are."
408,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,Uh-oh.
409,00:17:05.53,00:17:05.53,Did you get it stuck?
410,00:17:06.87,00:17:06.87,I either got a bite or something's caught.
411,00:17:09.70,00:17:09.70,"DEENA: I feel as if  we're in control, Rob and I."
412,00:17:11.57,00:17:11.57," Ultimately, I'm in control,  you know, 'cause I always"
413,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,have a backup plan after my backup plan fails.
414,00:17:17.60,00:17:17.60,"You have to be thinking 24/7 here,"
415,00:17:19.90,00:17:19.90,and it's making my head hurt.
416,00:17:22.67,00:17:22.67,This is getting so interesting.
417,00:17:29.47,00:17:29.47,I'm so full.
418,00:17:31.53,00:17:31.53,"Me, too."
419,00:17:32.97,00:17:32.97,"(groans) I'm not worried about, uh,"
420,00:17:35.20,00:17:35.20,I'm not worried about eating any manioc when I get home.
421,00:17:36.93,00:17:36.93,No.
422,00:17:38.20,00:17:38.20,"JENNA: I think I drank  four iced coffees,"
423,00:17:40.87,00:17:40.87, and we both had  a cappuccino and then
424,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33, Alex had one more iced coffee.
425,00:17:43.93,00:17:43.93,(slurping)
426,00:17:45.30,00:17:45.30,"That's a lot of coffee in a short amount of time,"
427,00:17:47.43,00:17:47.43,so we-we were buzzing.
428,00:17:58.87,00:17:58.87,Let's eat a lot of manioc.
429,00:18:00.27,00:18:00.27,Okay.
430,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,I'm so hungry.
431,00:18:02.50,00:18:02.50,I know.
432,00:18:03.93,00:18:03.93,"Yes, the fun never stops here in the Amazon."
433,00:18:06.67,00:18:06.67,"Hey, how are you guys?"
434,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67,How are you?
435,00:18:09.67,00:18:09.67,"Oh, we missed you."
436,00:18:12.43,00:18:12.43,We have an announcement.
437,00:18:13.90,00:18:13.90,"Um, first off,"
438,00:18:15.40,00:18:15.40,"Jenna and I would like to, uh, say that we're more than willing"
439,00:18:19.47,00:18:19.47,to take at least the first two fire watch shifts 'cause
440,00:18:22.47,00:18:22.47,her four cups of coffee and my five
441,00:18:24.53,00:18:24.53,pretty much guarantees no sleep for quite some time.
442,00:18:27.73,00:18:27.73,"-Yada, yada, yada. -But if you could all"
443,00:18:29.57,00:18:29.57,just take a seat over here for a minute.
444,00:18:32.80,00:18:32.80,"Um, good thing about being"
445,00:18:34.97,00:18:34.97,-(cheering) -at the cafe
446,00:18:37.30,00:18:37.30,is that cookies can actually travel.
447,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,So everybody gets two cookies.
448,00:18:42.00,00:18:42.00,They kind of broke.
449,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"That's all we could make,"
450,00:18:44.57,00:18:44.57,that's all we could make it out of there with.
451,00:18:46.57,00:18:46.57,But I wanted to make sure that there was some for everybody.
452,00:18:48.70,00:18:48.70,Thank you.
453,00:18:49.70,00:18:49.70,-Thanks. -So enjoy them.
454,00:18:51.93,00:18:51.93,"Enjoy them, my friends."
455,00:18:53.03,00:18:53.03,"I'd just like to say, for the record,"
456,00:18:54.30,00:18:54.30,-that I don't approve of this. -Okay.
457,00:18:55.90,00:18:55.90,(laughter)
458,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,ROB: When Alex and Jenna  came back from
459,00:18:59.87,00:18:59.87," the reward challenge,  they brought back two cookies"
460,00:19:02.40,00:19:02.40,"for each of us, which was a very nice gesture"
461,00:19:05.13,00:19:05.13,and much appreciated by the tribe.
462,00:19:06.97,00:19:06.97,"But Matt and Butch were in the boat,"
463,00:19:08.83,00:19:08.83,and they didn't know there were any cookies.
464,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,"There's, uh, there's a little bit there"
465,00:19:12.20,00:19:12.20,for the two of them to grub on.
466,00:19:13.53,00:19:13.53,"Yeah, there's two cookies there."
467,00:19:15.30,00:19:15.30,We could eat all the cookies.
468,00:19:16.50,00:19:16.50,"Hey, hey-- \xe2\x99\xaa La, la, la, la, la, la, la... \xe2\x99\xaa"
469,00:19:19.70,00:19:19.70,I was very fair.
470,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,ROB: I thought that  we could just eat the cookies
471,00:19:23.70,00:19:23.70,and Matt and Butch wouldn't know.
472,00:19:25.60,00:19:25.60,"I mean, they're really on the outside looking in, power-wise."
473,00:19:28.70,00:19:28.70,"Even if they found out, what are they going to do?"
474,00:19:32.93,00:19:32.93,Oh. Son of a...
475,00:19:36.50,00:19:36.50,"Man, I want to catch some ... damn fish."
476,00:19:39.43,00:19:39.43,BUTCH: Matt and I have been  trying to catch fish.
477,00:19:41.30,00:19:41.30, And we caught 12 fish  the first day we were here.
478,00:19:44.33,00:19:44.33," The next day,  we caught six fish."
479,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80, We caught one this morning.
480,00:19:46.97,00:19:46.97,We fished for three hours.
481,00:19:48.10,00:19:48.10,"It got so hot out there, we could hardly take it."
482,00:19:50.07,00:19:50.07,Here we go.
483,00:19:53.50,00:19:53.50,"Oh, oh."
484,00:19:56.20,00:19:56.20,"Dude, he took my bait."
485,00:19:57.40,00:19:57.40,The bastard.
486,00:19:58.47,00:19:58.47,Got something going here.
487,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90,Got him.
488,00:20:03.57,00:20:03.57,-Got one. -Bring it in.
489,00:20:05.17,00:20:05.17,"Good job, dude."
490,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,Got him.
491,00:20:08.27,00:20:08.27,Awesome.
492,00:20:09.70,00:20:09.70,"Nice... Nice-size piranha, dude."
493,00:20:13.10,00:20:13.10,Piranhas have real sharp teeth and they're really long.
494,00:20:16.20,00:20:16.20," I had one on the boat,  and I stabbed him in the head"
495,00:20:18.90,00:20:18.90," two times with my knife, had already cut him all the way up,"
496,00:20:22.10,00:20:22.10, and I was getting ready to turn him over to skin him...
497,00:20:25.03,00:20:25.03,Ow! Got bit.
498,00:20:26.57,00:20:26.57,Bad?
499,00:20:29.73,00:20:29.73, It hurt.  And that fish was dead.
500,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17," I don't know, it must have  just saw my finger,"
501,00:20:33.30,00:20:33.30, come right around and bit me.
502,00:20:34.73,00:20:34.73," Yeah, that was stupid of me,"
503,00:20:36.13,00:20:36.13,"but I thought the fish was dead, and he had one last bite."
504,00:20:40.17,00:20:40.17,MATTHEW:  How bad?
505,00:20:41.43,00:20:41.43,"Eh, he nailed me."
506,00:20:42.77,00:20:42.77,He got me pretty good.
507,00:21:07.70,00:21:07.70,Good news first: we caught fish.
508,00:21:10.57,00:21:10.57,"Bad news: a few small, puny fish."
509,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,-We brought you back some cookies. -Boo-yah!
510,00:21:15.87,00:21:15.87,"-Oh, you guys are the best, man. -Thank you."
511,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,"I mean, they kind of didn't travel well."
512,00:21:20.03,00:21:20.03,Everyone's gotten theirs except for the two of you.
513,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60,You got to split this up.
514,00:21:22.83,00:21:22.83,"I'm sorry I could not take you with me, Matt,"
515,00:21:24.17,00:21:24.17,but I did promise Jenna.
516,00:21:26.00,00:21:26.00,"You know, promises are really what it's all about."
517,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,We'll be right back. We're gonna go to the bathroom.
518,00:21:31.93,00:21:31.93,ROB: Deena had told Heidi  not to say anything to Jenna
519,00:21:36.03,00:21:36.03, about Deena's plans  to get rid of Alex.
520,00:21:38.80,00:21:38.80, But following
521,00:21:40.10,00:21:40.10,"Alex and Jenna's return from the reward challenge,"
522,00:21:42.83,00:21:42.83, Heidi told Jenna everything.
523,00:21:45.00,00:21:45.00,"(whispering): Yes, I do... I don't know..."
524,00:21:47.33,00:21:47.33,HEIDI: Alex and Jenna  were my original alliance.
525,00:21:49.40,00:21:49.40, I'm not going to turn  my back on them.
526,00:21:51.33,00:21:51.33," So, I mean,  I just told Jenna about it,"
527,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,and I knew she'd speak to Alex about it.
528,00:21:56.03,00:21:56.03,"So, wait, what did Heidi say to you?"
529,00:21:58.80,00:21:58.80,"Heidi said that she-she ... turned on us,"
530,00:22:01.77,00:22:01.77,so we need to get her off after Matt.
531,00:22:05.37,00:22:05.37,How did Heidi find this out?
532,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,"I guess, Deena said something to her and, like..."
533,00:22:08.83,00:22:08.83,JENNA: Deena stabbed us all  in the back
534,00:22:10.57,00:22:10.57, because she's being selfish.
535,00:22:12.10,00:22:12.10, I'm really pissed at her.
536,00:22:13.83,00:22:13.83,She's obviously trouble.
537,00:22:15.10,00:22:15.10,She's starting trouble already.
538,00:22:17.07,00:22:17.07,That doesn't need to happen around the camp.
539,00:22:19.10,00:22:19.10,We still got two days.
540,00:22:20.63,00:22:20.63,"-But I'm-I'm worried about Rob. -Butch, Butch..."
541,00:22:22.20,00:22:22.20,Why would Rob pick her over us?
542,00:22:23.63,00:22:23.63,"Because, see, I know he gave her a word."
543,00:22:25.23,00:22:25.23,"ALEX: And so, I grabbed Rob,  and I was, like,"
544,00:22:27.13,00:22:27.13,"""Rob, dude, what's going on?"""
545,00:22:28.33,00:22:28.33,"He goes, ""What do you mean?"""
546,00:22:29.67,00:22:29.67,"I was, like, ""So, now, I'm on list?"
547,00:22:31.10,00:22:31.10,"I'm-- My head's on the block?"""
548,00:22:32.23,00:22:32.23,"He says, ""How do you know that?"
549,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,"That just happened this afternoon while you were gone."""
550,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,"I was, like, ""Dude, 'cause I'm good."
551,00:22:36.43,00:22:36.43,"I know what's going on."""
552,00:22:37.53,00:22:37.53," And he was, like, ""Yeah."
553,00:22:39.00,00:22:39.00," Deena wants to get rid of  Matt next, and then you."""
554,00:22:41.53,00:22:41.53,She wants you done sooner than later.
555,00:22:43.10,00:22:43.10,"Dude, you know what?"
556,00:22:44.47,00:22:44.47,"Here's-Here's my, here's my plan then."
557,00:22:46.13,00:22:46.13,Mm-hmm.
558,00:22:47.40,00:22:47.40,"In two days, we vote off Matt."
559,00:22:49.73,00:22:49.73,"Three days after that, we keep Christy"
560,00:22:52.73,00:22:52.73,and we keep Butch and we get rid of Deena.
561,00:22:56.90,00:22:56.90,ROB:  Things have
562,00:22:58.13,00:22:58.13,really gotten interesting over here at Jacar\xc3\xa9.
563,00:23:02.37,00:23:02.37," It's Deena versus Alex,  and both think that"
564,00:23:06.73,00:23:06.73,they're calling the shots in this game.
565,00:23:30.97,00:23:30.97,HEIDI:  I feel so retarded right now
566,00:23:34.80,00:23:34.80, because of some spider bite.
567,00:23:37.13,00:23:37.13,"Oh, wow."
568,00:23:38.77,00:23:38.77,It's getting bad.
569,00:23:40.90,00:23:40.90,-Can't bend it at all? -Uh-uh.
570,00:23:42.50,00:23:42.50,-What's the status? -I don't know.
571,00:23:44.03,00:23:44.03,"I mean, it just won't bend now."
572,00:23:45.53,00:23:45.53,"Like, I mean, it was such a sharp pain, I almost lost it."
573,00:23:48.23,00:23:48.23," It started off sore, and it started turning black and blue."
574,00:23:51.63,00:23:51.63,I am not even able to touch my knee without extreme pain.
575,00:23:56.83,00:23:56.83,"I mean, I literally cannot bend it."
576,00:23:59.30,00:23:59.30,Your-Your knee is hot from here.
577,00:24:02.20,00:24:02.20,It-It's... pretty much to here.
578,00:24:03.63,00:24:03.63,You want me to carry you over and put you down over there?
579,00:24:05.77,00:24:05.77,"No, no, I'll-I'll walk."
580,00:24:07.30,00:24:07.30,"ROB: Heidi has been bitten by  some insect, and it has now"
581,00:24:11.53,00:24:11.53,"reached the size of one of her breasts on her knee,"
582,00:24:14.77,00:24:14.77, so it's very hard for her  to walk around.
583,00:24:17.23,00:24:17.23," Hopefully,  she'll have it drained."
584,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,Stupid bugs.
585,00:24:21.77,00:24:21.77,(laughs)
586,00:24:33.43,00:24:33.43,Let's see what's in the old mailbox.
587,00:24:35.77,00:24:35.77,Treemail.
588,00:24:37.53,00:24:37.53,"Oh, yes."
589,00:24:38.70,00:24:38.70,What do you got?
590,00:24:39.97,00:24:39.97,Is it something fun?
591,00:24:41.47,00:24:41.47,"""What do you crave more, immunity or food?"""
592,00:24:44.80,00:24:44.80,I'm eating.
593,00:24:45.80,00:24:45.80,"""The thought of going home tonight"
594,00:24:47.97,00:24:47.97,"""might put your palate"
595,00:24:49.30,00:24:49.30,"-in the mood."" -In the mood."
596,00:24:50.60,00:24:50.60,What's that mean?
597,00:24:51.90,00:24:51.90,That I don't understand.
598,00:24:53.23,00:24:53.23,"-Oh, wait. No. I don't know. -No."
599,00:24:54.77,00:24:54.77,I'm confused. Maybe I'm just an idiot.
600,00:24:57.03,00:24:57.03,-This says right here... -Great.
601,00:24:58.43,00:24:58.43,"...""immunity or food."""
602,00:25:01.20,00:25:01.20,"No, I'm hungry."
603,00:25:03.83,00:25:03.83,The plan leading up to the immunity challenge
604,00:25:06.43,00:25:06.43,"has always been Matt first, Matt first, Matt first, Matt first."
605,00:25:09.80,00:25:09.80,"""What do you crave more, immunity or food?"""
606,00:25:11.90,00:25:11.90,Dur.
607,00:25:13.53,00:25:13.53," But we've decided and we've  agreed, if Matt wins immunity,"
608,00:25:17.27,00:25:17.27, Alex must go.
609,00:25:18.83,00:25:18.83,He's gone.
610,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,"Period, end of statement."
611,00:25:21.77,00:25:21.77,I'm so ready for--
612,00:25:23.60,00:25:23.60,-Let's go now. -(chuckling)
613,00:25:25.00,00:25:25.00,Anybody feel like canoeing?
614,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,You keep eating the manioc.
615,00:25:33.17,00:25:33.17,"Come on in, guys."
616,00:25:36.37,00:25:36.37,Got a wrapped knee.
617,00:25:37.70,00:25:37.70,-Thank you so much. -Uh-huh.
618,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,What happened?
619,00:25:41.83,00:25:41.83,We believe a spider.
620,00:25:44.07,00:25:44.07,Stupid spiders. (chuckles)
621,00:25:45.63,00:25:45.63,"So, in a physical competition, you're in trouble right now."
622,00:25:48.80,00:25:48.80,Slightly.
623,00:25:49.80,00:25:49.80,We've all gotten bit.
624,00:25:51.57,00:25:51.57,27 days you've been out here.
625,00:25:53.40,00:25:53.40,Not bad.
626,00:25:54.90,00:25:54.90,"And probably, from day one, the most common thought"
627,00:25:56.50,00:25:56.50,-in your head has been... -Food.
628,00:25:57.57,00:25:57.57,-Food. Mmm. -Food.
629,00:25:59.23,00:25:59.23,"-I'll be the first to say. -Oh, yes."
630,00:26:01.03,00:26:01.03,"You want food, today you're getting food."
631,00:26:02.87,00:26:02.87,Oh! All of us?
632,00:26:03.87,00:26:03.87,-Nice. -Yes.
633,00:26:05.00,00:26:05.00,"There's a catch, guys."
634,00:26:06.63,00:26:06.63,We've prepared a nice Amazonian menu for you.
635,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,Many of the items on the menu
636,00:26:10.53,00:26:10.53,are actually things that can be found in your own camp.
637,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,"They're all delicacies in the Amazon, and, more importantly,"
638,00:26:15.53,00:26:15.53,"in a survival situation, they are a necessity."
639,00:26:18.00,00:26:18.00,There will be four courses.
640,00:26:19.57,00:26:19.57,The last two people to finish their food in each round will be
641,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,eliminated until we're left with the final two.
642,00:26:24.23,00:26:24.23,Last one left standing wins immunity.
643,00:26:26.90,00:26:26.90,"Speaking of which, give it up, Jenna."
644,00:26:31.13,00:26:31.13,I know that's nice to have around the neck.
645,00:26:33.67,00:26:33.67,"Do well today, you can have it again."
646,00:26:34.97,00:26:34.97,Immunity is back up for grabs.
647,00:26:37.03,00:26:37.03,We will draw numbers to determine
648,00:26:39.20,00:26:39.20,"your order at the table, and we'll get started."
649,00:26:41.27,00:26:41.27,Hope you brought an appetite.
650,00:26:42.87,00:26:42.87,"Okay, go ahead and take off your tops."
651,00:26:46.83,00:26:46.83,-Okay. -These are Amazonian grasshoppers.
652,00:26:49.37,00:26:49.37,They're a little larger than a traditional grasshopper
653,00:26:51.30,00:26:51.30,"and, I might add, a little tastier, as well."
654,00:26:54.10,00:26:54.10,Have you tried one?
655,00:26:55.23,00:26:55.23,-I certainly have. -Nice.
656,00:26:56.57,00:26:56.57,So here's the rule.
657,00:26:57.57,00:26:57.57,You need to show me an empty mouth.
658,00:26:59.87,00:26:59.87,"Now, once I've said you're good,"
659,00:27:01.80,00:27:01.80,"if it comes back up, that's okay."
660,00:27:03.73,00:27:03.73,But you gotta get it down for me to see it.
661,00:27:05.70,00:27:05.70,-I can't eat this. -The first six
662,00:27:07.70,00:27:07.70,to finish their grasshopper move on to the next round.
663,00:27:10.47,00:27:10.47,The last two are out.
664,00:27:12.10,00:27:12.10,-Everybody ready? -Yep. -Yeah.
665,00:27:14.07,00:27:14.07,Survivors ready?
666,00:27:15.23,00:27:15.23,Go.
667,00:27:24.70,00:27:24.70,It's a little dry.
668,00:27:25.90,00:27:25.90,Mm-hmm.
669,00:27:27.00,00:27:27.00,-I'd say so. -And once you finish
670,00:27:28.63,00:27:28.63,"and I say you're good, step away from the table."
671,00:27:30.67,00:27:30.67,Christy having a little trouble.
672,00:27:34.07,00:27:34.07,Heidi's trying to convince herself.
673,00:27:35.73,00:27:35.73,Mind over matter. Mind over matter.
674,00:27:38.70,00:27:38.70,Matthew's in.
675,00:27:39.70,00:27:39.70,"You're good, step back."
676,00:27:42.03,00:27:42.03,Looking for five more.
677,00:27:43.67,00:27:43.67,"(gagging, coughing)"
678,00:27:47.00,00:27:47.00,Keep it down.
679,00:27:50.40,00:27:50.40,"Deena, you're good."
680,00:27:52.13,00:27:52.13,"Uh-uh, I'm not going any farther."
681,00:27:54.20,00:27:54.20,Ah!
682,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,"Alex, you're good. That's three."
683,00:27:56.97,00:27:56.97,Looking for three more.
684,00:27:58.77,00:27:58.77,-It's really dry. -Rob working on it.
685,00:28:01.77,00:28:01.77,-It's dry. I mean... -It's hard to swallow.
686,00:28:03.23,00:28:03.23,"-It doesn't taste that bad. -You got it down, good."
687,00:28:07.13,00:28:07.13,"Christy, get the rest in."
688,00:28:10.60,00:28:10.60,Keep it down.
689,00:28:11.70,00:28:11.70,(gagging)
690,00:28:14.03,00:28:14.03,Sorry. I'd rather have manioc.
691,00:28:15.77,00:28:15.77,Y-You're that confident about immunity?
692,00:28:17.17,00:28:17.17,"No, I just can't eat it."
693,00:28:18.60,00:28:18.60,"Rob, you're, you're still a ways away."
694,00:28:20.80,00:28:20.80,You got half that grasshopper left.
695,00:28:24.03,00:28:24.03,"-How you doing, Butch? -I'm enjoying it."
696,00:28:26.43,00:28:26.43,"Go, you got it, Christy. Do it."
697,00:28:29.03,00:28:29.03,"Ooh, crunchy."
698,00:28:30.27,00:28:30.27,(gagging)
699,00:28:31.53,00:28:31.53,"Come on, Heidi."
700,00:28:33.37,00:28:33.37,I just gotta get it down.
701,00:28:34.43,00:28:34.43,-It's hard to swallow. -Mm-hmm.
702,00:28:36.03,00:28:36.03,"It is a bit hard to swallow, man."
703,00:28:38.93,00:28:38.93,You're good. That's four.
704,00:28:40.80,00:28:40.80,Two more moving on.
705,00:28:41.87,00:28:41.87,-Jenna's already... -(retching)
706,00:28:43.27,00:28:43.27,"-Oh, no. -That's good, Butch."
707,00:28:44.70,00:28:44.70,"Christy, it's you and Heidi."
708,00:28:46.43,00:28:46.43,"Swallow it, Heidi."
709,00:28:52.63,00:28:52.63,That's it.
710,00:28:54.37,00:28:54.37,Christy's in.
711,00:28:55.57,00:28:55.57,"Christy's in by a second, Heidi."
712,00:28:57.33,00:28:57.33,"Good try, Heidi."
713,00:28:58.40,00:28:58.40,Good try.
714,00:28:59.40,00:28:59.40,(retching)
715,00:29:00.70,00:29:00.70,"Heidi and Jenna, have a seat on the bench."
716,00:29:03.17,00:29:03.17,Guys ready for the next round?
717,00:29:04.27,00:29:04.27,-Mm-hmm. -Open up.
718,00:29:05.93,00:29:05.93,See if these look familiar.
719,00:29:07.33,00:29:07.33,You have ten babassu worms.
720,00:29:08.77,00:29:08.77,These are coconut worms.
721,00:29:09.93,00:29:09.93,"You guys have had these at camp, I'm sure."
722,00:29:11.23,00:29:11.23,Now it's just a matter of
723,00:29:12.50,00:29:12.50,getting ten down the fastest.
724,00:29:13.73,00:29:13.73,Four of you will move on.
725,00:29:15.80,00:29:15.80,Two will not move on.
726,00:29:17.47,00:29:17.47,-Everybody ready? -Mm-hmm.
727,00:29:18.97,00:29:18.97,Survivors ready?
728,00:29:20.07,00:29:20.07,Go.
729,00:29:23.00,00:29:23.00,"-Matthew's in. -All right, Matt."
730,00:29:24.30,00:29:24.30,Deena is in.
731,00:29:26.23,00:29:26.23,Alex is in.
732,00:29:27.23,00:29:27.23,That's it.
733,00:29:28.63,00:29:28.63,"-Christy's in. -Mm, mm, mm!"
734,00:29:30.80,00:29:30.80,"Rob and Butch, you're out."
735,00:29:31.80,00:29:31.80,"Sorry, buddy."
736,00:29:33.57,00:29:33.57,"You gonna go ahead and finish, Rob?"
737,00:29:34.97,00:29:34.97,-I like them. -Here's the deal.
738,00:29:36.73,00:29:36.73,Two of you will move on to the final.
739,00:29:38.33,00:29:38.33,Two of you will be out.
740,00:29:40.10,00:29:40.10,Go ahead and take off your tops.
741,00:29:41.93,00:29:41.93,"Oh, blech."
742,00:29:44.20,00:29:44.20,"-Five beetles. -Oh, God."
743,00:29:45.20,00:29:45.20,Medium-size. They're not large.
744,00:29:47.43,00:29:47.43,That's disgusting.
745,00:29:48.43,00:29:48.43,"Oh, marone.  (laughs)"
746,00:29:49.77,00:29:49.77,Baked.
747,00:29:50.83,00:29:50.83,A little crispy.
748,00:29:52.30,00:29:52.30,Survivors ready?
749,00:29:53.63,00:29:53.63,Go.
750,00:30:07.70,00:30:07.70,(gagging)
751,00:30:11.40,00:30:11.40,Christy having trouble.
752,00:30:12.53,00:30:12.53,"Get 'em down, Christy."
753,00:30:14.37,00:30:14.37,"That-a-way, Deena."
754,00:30:16.63,00:30:16.63,Matthew looking good.
755,00:30:18.93,00:30:18.93,Hurry.
756,00:30:20.67,00:30:20.67,Nobody rushing.
757,00:30:22.27,00:30:22.27,"-Hurry, hurry. -Let's see. Show it to me."
758,00:30:24.30,00:30:24.30,"-Hurry, hurry, hurry. -Down, down, down. That's good."
759,00:30:25.87,00:30:25.87,Matthew's in.
760,00:30:26.87,00:30:26.87,Looking for one more.
761,00:30:28.47,00:30:28.47,"-Hurry! -Between Christy, Deena and Alex."
762,00:30:31.47,00:30:31.47,Get it down.
763,00:30:34.70,00:30:34.70,Come on.
764,00:30:35.70,00:30:35.70,-Deena's close. -Come on.
765,00:30:37.03,00:30:37.03,(gagging)
766,00:30:38.43,00:30:38.43,"Come on, Christy."
767,00:30:41.03,00:30:41.03,Deena is in.
768,00:30:42.67,00:30:42.67,Christy's throwing up.
769,00:30:44.27,00:30:44.27,"Christy and Alex, you're out."
770,00:30:46.13,00:30:46.13,"The final round, the final course."
771,00:30:51.30,00:30:51.30,"One for you, Deena."
772,00:30:52.90,00:30:52.90,"Specially prepared for you, Matthew."
773,00:30:55.30,00:30:55.30,Mm-hmm.
774,00:30:56.50,00:30:56.50,"They ordered ahead just for you, Mateo."
775,00:30:58.67,00:30:58.67,Thank God.
776,00:30:59.67,00:30:59.67,"Okay, comes down to this."
777,00:31:01.90,00:31:01.90,One final course.
778,00:31:03.50,00:31:03.50,Immunity at stake.
779,00:31:05.53,00:31:05.53,You guys have proven you can eat pretty much anything.
780,00:31:07.27,00:31:07.27,Take a look at your last course.
781,00:31:08.93,00:31:08.93,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me."
782,00:31:11.03,00:31:11.03,-What is it? -What is it?
783,00:31:12.73,00:31:12.73,That is just nasty-ass.
784,00:31:13.93,00:31:13.93,-Let me see. -What do you got?
785,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07,-Show it. -It's alive.
786,00:31:16.53,00:31:16.53,-What is it? -It's a big grub.
787,00:31:17.80,00:31:17.80,"It's just a big, old nasty-- what is it?"
788,00:31:19.37,00:31:19.37,"-Oh, that's foul. -Big grub and it's alive"
789,00:31:21.03,00:31:21.03,and it's got big teeth.
790,00:31:22.20,00:31:22.20,"Sweet, dude!"
791,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,And it's got really sharp claws.
792,00:31:24.57,00:31:24.57,Put it back down now.
793,00:31:25.97,00:31:25.97,Beetle larva found in the trunks of dead trees.
794,00:31:29.10,00:31:29.10,Very common out here.
795,00:31:30.57,00:31:30.57,The only difference is it's alive.
796,00:31:31.90,00:31:31.90,It's not been baked or barbecued.
797,00:31:34.17,00:31:34.17,"We've taken the pinchers off, so it won't hurt you going down."
798,00:31:37.40,00:31:37.40,Here we go.
799,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,"For immunity, Deena and Matthew."
800,00:31:42.57,00:31:42.57,"It's real simple, guys: get it down first"
801,00:31:44.40,00:31:44.40,or you could be in trouble at Tribal Council.
802,00:31:46.13,00:31:46.13,Huge stakes. Here we go.
803,00:31:47.87,00:31:47.87,Survivors ready?
804,00:31:50.77,00:31:50.77,Go.
805,00:31:54.90,00:31:54.90,"-Wow, you swallowed it whole? -(cheering)"
806,00:31:57.80,00:31:57.80,-Yes! -(whooping)
807,00:31:59.33,00:31:59.33,You didn't even kill it?
808,00:32:02.77,00:32:02.77,"-Good job, Matt. -Wow! -That thing is"
809,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,still working its way down.
810,00:32:05.70,00:32:05.70,I'm hoping my digestive juices
811,00:32:07.33,00:32:07.33,are going to do battle and hopefully win.
812,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,"-This guy is crazy. -Dude, that was awesome!"
813,00:32:10.40,00:32:10.40,You are nuts.
814,00:32:11.53,00:32:11.53,(howling)
815,00:32:12.93,00:32:12.93,"Hey, hey, wave, guys."
816,00:32:14.73,00:32:14.73,(cheering)
817,00:32:19.87,00:32:19.87,"Yeah, baby!"
818,00:32:20.87,00:32:20.87,Yeah!
819,00:32:21.87,00:32:21.87,"All right, Matt."
820,00:32:23.00,00:32:23.00,You are safe from the vote tonight.
821,00:32:25.80,00:32:25.80,-Cool. Thanks a lot. -Nice effort.
822,00:32:27.80,00:32:27.80,"Everybody else, you know the drill."
823,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30,Somebody's going home. You can head back to camp.
824,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,I'll see you at Tribal later.
825,00:32:55.80,00:32:55.80,"I'll be right back, guys. I'm gonna..."
826,00:32:57.37,00:32:57.37,we're going to wash.
827,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,DEENA: The mistake that Alex  made at the immunity challenge
828,00:33:05.13,00:33:05.13, was to lose  the immunity challenge.
829,00:33:07.47,00:33:07.47, Alex needed to win
830,00:33:08.60,00:33:08.60,to save his heinie.
831,00:33:10.07,00:33:10.07,Didn't happen.
832,00:33:11.40,00:33:11.40, My ass really had to have  been on the line today
833,00:33:13.83,00:33:13.83, for me to have eaten  that grotesque thing.
834,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13," If everybody is still with me,"
835,00:33:18.30,00:33:18.30,why even try?
836,00:33:20.00,00:33:20.00,So what's going on?
837,00:33:21.87,00:33:21.87,"Um, Alex is, by far, the next in line."
838,00:33:25.70,00:33:25.70,Alex has to go next.
839,00:33:28.73,00:33:28.73,Next.
840,00:33:29.73,00:33:29.73,Okay.
841,00:33:31.00,00:33:31.00,"That's understandable, 'cause when..."
842,00:33:32.37,00:33:32.37, I convinced Jenna
843,00:33:34.23,00:33:34.23," Alex is too great of a threat,  so he's gone."
844,00:33:38.23,00:33:38.23,"(singsongy): Bye-bye, Alex. Bye-bye, Alex."
845,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,I'm-- we're completely in control of this.
846,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"Oh, yeah."
847,00:33:43.90,00:33:43.90,"So you're with me, right?"
848,00:33:44.90,00:33:44.90,"-Yeah. -Okay, pinky swear."
849,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,-All right. -So...
850,00:33:49.97,00:33:49.97,JENNA: Deena's been  in alliance with me and Alex
851,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83," and Rob and Heidi,  but she stabbed us all"
852,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,"in the back, and I am"
853,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,so incredibly disappointed and shocked.
854,00:33:57.63,00:33:57.63,And I can't ever forgive that.
855,00:34:05.33,00:34:05.33,"So, this is the first time I've been pissed off in this game."
856,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,"-Mm-hmm. -You, too?"
857,00:34:09.10,00:34:09.10,I'm just tired of sitting on those logs all day.
858,00:34:11.13,00:34:11.13,Deena took me aside and talked to me.
859,00:34:13.63,00:34:13.63,What'd she say?
860,00:34:14.90,00:34:14.90,"You know, Alex needs to go next."
861,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,"She wants the final four to be you, Heidi, Christy and her."
862,00:34:20.00,00:34:20.00,She just wants all the girls-- all the guys gone first.
863,00:34:22.90,00:34:22.90,"She told me, quote, ""We control this game."""
864,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,"And I was like, hmm, you've said that to everybody."
865,00:34:27.23,00:34:27.23,Mm-hmm.
866,00:34:28.77,00:34:28.77,"She's like, ""I have Rob around my finger and he has Matt."""
867,00:34:33.20,00:34:33.20,So that's where it stands at this point.
868,00:34:36.90,00:34:36.90,"It's just... if Rob turns on us, then we're screwed."
869,00:34:39.93,00:34:39.93,That's true.
870,00:34:41.53,00:34:41.53,...the cat?
871,00:34:43.13,00:34:43.13,Ah!
872,00:34:47.37,00:34:47.37,ROB: I'm sort of in both circles  in all this right now.
873,00:34:50.27,00:34:50.27," I get information  from Deena and Alex, too,"
874,00:34:53.87,00:34:53.87,"which is sort of a precarious position to be in,"
875,00:34:56.20,00:34:56.20,'cause it could backfire.
876,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"Alex is a, is a greater threat, only because"
877,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,he's gonna make a power play with the girls to get rid of us.
878,00:35:03.10,00:35:03.10,Right.
879,00:35:04.37,00:35:04.37,I don't want that to happen.
880,00:35:05.40,00:35:05.40,Okay.
881,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,And you have more control over the Butch and Matt thing because
882,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,they can be led in different directions
883,00:35:10.50,00:35:10.50,-to vote for whomever. -Yeah.
884,00:35:12.03,00:35:12.03,"DEENA: Rob is doing his own  little work with, uh, Matt,"
885,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80," and Matt, of course,  then, will talk with Butch."
886,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33, And so it all kind of--
887,00:35:18.93,00:35:18.93,"our little fingers are out reaching,"
888,00:35:20.40,00:35:20.40,and it's all falling into place.
889,00:35:22.20,00:35:22.20,Girls are playing their part.
890,00:35:24.33,00:35:24.33,(sighs) Whew!
891,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,So... we'll do it.
892,00:35:28.73,00:35:28.73,Do Alex next?
893,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,I think so.
894,00:35:31.30,00:35:31.30,ROB: Deena and Alex both think they have the exact same people
895,00:35:35.60,00:35:35.60, to vote the other one off.
896,00:35:37.40,00:35:37.40, And both think that their plan
897,00:35:39.10,00:35:39.10, is going to work  without a hitch.
898,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,"It's like we're in the Mob, and that there's gonna be a hit"
899,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,"on one of my friends, and I really have to look"
900,00:35:47.90,00:35:47.90,the other way and act like everything's hunky-dory.
901,00:35:50.87,00:35:50.87,"But when we go to Tribal Council tonight,"
902,00:35:53.73,00:35:53.73,the one person that's gonna get the hit tonight
903,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,is gonna be the person that least expects it.
904,00:36:23.87,00:36:23.87,Welcome to Tribal Council.
905,00:36:27.63,00:36:27.63,We'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
906,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,Dave is here only to observe.
907,00:36:33.00,00:36:33.00,Just gathering information to help in a very important vote.
908,00:36:40.70,00:36:40.70,"Heidi, what the heck is going on with your knee?"
909,00:36:43.57,00:36:43.57,(laughs): I wish I knew.
910,00:36:45.60,00:36:45.60,"I mean, it's getting better, though."
911,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,"It's getting better, and I think honestly,"
912,00:36:48.73,00:36:48.73,"probably in two days, I-I'll be good to go."
913,00:36:50.73,00:36:50.73,Did it concern you at all?
914,00:36:52.07,00:36:52.07,"-I mean, this is an individual game. -Yes!"
915,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,"Oh, my gosh, yes."
916,00:36:54.93,00:36:54.93,"I'm sitting here, okay, my strongest"
917,00:36:56.87,00:36:56.87,assets to this group are
918,00:36:58.97,00:36:58.97,athletic ability and intelligence.
919,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,"And, hello, one of those is gone right now."
920,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,-Which one? -(laughter)
921,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,"Well, uh, that's a very good question."
922,00:37:10.07,00:37:10.07,"Deena, now that we are in the jury phase of this game,"
923,00:37:13.27,00:37:13.27,have you noticed any palpable change in the game?
924,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,Game is on.
925,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,People are jockeying for positions.
926,00:37:21.27,00:37:21.27,There is a struggle for-- and I wouldn't say power--
927,00:37:24.30,00:37:24.30,but there's a struggle to see who has power.
928,00:37:26.07,00:37:26.07,You bet. Absolutely a change.
929,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,People are a little on edge.
930,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,It's no longer about survival in the Amazon.
931,00:37:32.23,00:37:32.23,It's survival in the Survivor game.
932,00:37:35.40,00:37:35.40,"Alex, you start to notice,"
933,00:37:37.73,00:37:37.73,"or maybe think you're noticing, people whispering"
934,00:37:40.23,00:37:40.23,or pairing off a little more often than they used to?
935,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,"To some extent, sure."
936,00:37:44.27,00:37:44.27,You can't help but get a little bit paranoid.
937,00:37:46.60,00:37:46.60,"And you start asking yourself questions about, like,"
938,00:37:49.07,00:37:49.07,whether or not ethics enters into the game or not.
939,00:37:51.90,00:37:51.90,Do you stab someone in the back?
940,00:37:53.43,00:37:53.43,"It's a balancing act, for sure."
941,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,See what happens.
942,00:37:57.60,00:37:57.60,"Matthew, how important was immunity for you to have?"
943,00:38:00.77,00:38:00.77,"Immunity was a nice thing to have today,"
944,00:38:04.23,00:38:04.23,"but for me, uh, personally, based on what I know"
945,00:38:08.13,00:38:08.13,"about the tribe and, uh, feelings"
946,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"and the mood of the tribe,"
947,00:38:11.87,00:38:11.87,"it wasn't, uh, absolutely essential."
948,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,Hmm. So are you willing to negotiate for it?
949,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,No.
950,00:38:18.37,00:38:18.37,(laughter)
951,00:38:19.93,00:38:19.93,"Alex, how nice would it be"
952,00:38:21.60,00:38:21.60,for you to have that necklace tonight?
953,00:38:23.37,00:38:23.37,I'd love to have that necklace.
954,00:38:24.90,00:38:24.90,I want to finish this game.
955,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,I want to win this game.
956,00:38:28.03,00:38:28.03,"I don't get into competitions to go, ""Eh, that's cool."
957,00:38:30.63,00:38:30.63,"I'm done now."""
958,00:38:31.63,00:38:31.63,It's not why I do it.
959,00:38:32.90,00:38:32.90,"And if my name comes up, well, then my name comes up."
960,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,I don't have any control over it.
961,00:38:38.83,00:38:38.83,"Deena, feel good about how you played the game?"
962,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,"Thus far, yes."
963,00:38:41.87,00:38:41.87,"If my name comes up, it would have come down to a bug."
964,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"I mean, essentially,"
965,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,"okay, spawned out of the pit of hell,"
966,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"but that thing-- that's what separates Matt and I,"
967,00:38:50.13,00:38:50.13,"is swallowing one giant, ugly grub."
968,00:38:54.03,00:38:54.03,It is time to vote.
969,00:38:56.27,00:38:56.27,"Christy, you're first."
970,00:39:07.60,00:39:07.60,"I vote for Alex tonight,"
971,00:39:09.10,00:39:09.10,"because he's a serious threat to the tribe,"
972,00:39:11.57,00:39:11.57,so I'm trying to get rid of him tonight.
973,00:39:26.90,00:39:26.90,"You lied to me, you betrayed me, you screwed me."
974,00:39:29.70,00:39:29.70,Now screw you.
975,00:39:39.30,00:39:39.30,"'Cause you are a mental and physical powerhouse,"
976,00:39:41.87,00:39:41.87,you're standing between me and the big prize.
977,00:39:57.50,00:39:57.50,"Deena, you couldn't even stick by your word for three days."
978,00:40:00.80,00:40:00.80,"I'd actually love to go up against you in court any day,"
979,00:40:03.30,00:40:03.30,'cause you're the worst liar I think I've ever met in my life.
980,00:40:33.00,00:40:33.00,I'll go tally the votes.
981,00:40:45.03,00:40:45.03,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
982,00:40:47.17,00:40:47.17,Person voted out will be asked
983,00:40:48.60,00:40:48.60,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
984,00:40:50.30,00:40:50.30,I'll read the votes.
985,00:40:54.87,00:40:54.87,First vote:
986,00:40:56.70,00:40:56.70,Deena.
987,00:41:03.27,00:41:03.27,Deena.
988,00:41:04.30,00:41:04.30,Two votes Deena.
989,00:41:08.63,00:41:08.63,Alex.
990,00:41:13.50,00:41:13.50,Alex.
991,00:41:15.07,00:41:15.07,"Two votes Alex, two votes Deena."
992,00:41:20.27,00:41:20.27,Three votes Deena.
993,00:41:25.07,00:41:25.07,"That's four votes Deena, two votes Alex."
994,00:41:31.13,00:41:31.13,"Ninth person voted out, the second member of our jury:"
995,00:41:34.37,00:41:34.37,Deena.
996,00:41:35.90,00:41:35.90,"That's five, and that's enough."
997,00:41:37.43,00:41:37.43,Need to bring me your torch.
998,00:41:39.43,00:41:39.43,No need to read the last vote.
999,00:41:50.27,00:41:50.27,"Deena, the tribe has spoken."
1000,00:41:54.90,00:41:54.90,It's time for you to go.
1001,00:42:08.90,00:42:08.90,"Well, you've survived nine Tribal Councils,"
1002,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,lasted 27 days.
1003,00:42:13.97,00:42:13.97,You're doing something right.
1004,00:42:15.20,00:42:15.20,These last 12 days will raise one very simple
1005,00:42:17.63,00:42:17.63,but important question: How badly do you want it?
1006,00:42:21.60,00:42:21.60,And what will you or won't you do to get it?
1007,00:42:25.80,00:42:25.80,Guys can head back to camp.
1008,00:42:27.37,00:42:27.37,Good night.
1009,00:42:40.90,00:42:40.90, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
1010,00:42:51.93,00:42:51.93,"They saw me as a threat, and I wanted to change"
1011,00:42:54.07,00:42:54.07,"the, uh, the face of the game a little bit"
1012,00:42:55.83,00:42:55.83, and vote off the people  that were the strongest
1013,00:42:57.63,00:42:57.63, so that we could  finish off until the end.
1014,00:42:59.53,00:42:59.53," Things happen,  people change their minds,"
1015,00:43:01.70,00:43:01.70,"relationships grow, and there's  attachments, so I got nixed."
1016,00:43:05.10,00:43:05.10, But remember that you're  going to have to live with
1017,00:43:07.20,00:43:07.20," the decisions  for the rest of your life,"
1018,00:43:08.67,00:43:08.67, so make sure that they count.
1019,00:43:09.77,00:43:09.77,Thanks for the ride.
1020,00:43:10.80,00:43:10.80,I had a good time.
