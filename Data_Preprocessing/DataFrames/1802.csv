164,00:10:33.08,00:10:33.08,"What happens with the rice isthat the rice soaks it all up,"
165,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,and I'm afraid you're gonnaburn stuff.

380,00:22:59.62,00:22:59.62,"fishing gear, which included acasting net, a couple fishing"
381,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,"poles, a spear and some hooksand stuff like that, so"
382,00:23:05.33,00:23:05.33,we're looking forward tospending our day without Tribal
383,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,Council going to try to findsome fish.
384,00:23:10.33,00:23:10.33,We need a physical challengelike that.
385,00:23:14.25,00:23:14.25,>> To be the winning tribefeels phenomenal.
386,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,"If we lost immunity, there wasprobably a 50% chance of me"
387,00:23:20.83,00:23:20.83,"going home.But we won, and I'm here for"
388,00:23:23.83,00:23:23.83,another several more days.>> A net-- a cast net.
389,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,>> Just ease out here aboutwaist deep.
390,00:23:31.79,00:23:31.79,We have to figure out how tothrow it so it spreads out when
391,00:23:34.25,00:23:34.25,it hits and you can catch baitfish that way.
392,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,>> J.T. has definitely emergedas our tribe leader and
393,00:23:41.04,00:23:41.04,"honestly, I'm thrilled to be outhere with him."
394,00:23:43.71,00:23:43.71,He's like no one I wouldhave met back at home and I
395,00:23:46.04,00:23:46.04,"think we're getting to know eachother, which I thought is sort"
396,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,of surprising because he's theAlabama country boy.
397,00:23:52.12,00:23:52.12,"He is Tom Sawyer, and I am theangsty city boy."
398,00:23:56.33,00:23:56.33,"He might just be seducing mewith his pretty country ways,"
399,00:23:59.04,00:23:59.04,but I'm smitten.>> You take the loose end...
400,00:24:05.12,00:24:05.12,>> Yeah.>> You go back through that
401,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,hole and back through that holeyou just created.
402,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,>> I see.>> What you'll do is just hold
403,00:24:13.58,00:24:13.58,"it until you feel them, andthen just snatch it."
404,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,Stephen and I come fromdifferent walks of life.
405,00:24:18.79,00:24:18.79,He's definitely a city boy andI'm an south Alabama cattle
406,00:24:21.54,00:24:21.54,farmer.But we get along really well.
407,00:24:23.50,00:24:23.50,So we have a good friendship.>> I'm going to become the
408,00:24:25.75,00:24:25.75,greatest spear fisherman thatever existed.
409,00:24:40.12,00:24:40.12,"Oh, my God!They're right here."
410,00:24:43.12,00:24:43.12,"There was, like, four or fiveof them."
411,00:24:46.71,00:24:46.71,We had some luck in seeing fish.Not so much in catching the
412,00:24:49.17,00:24:49.17,"fish, but I think the fishingtrip was successful in"
413,00:24:52.00,00:24:52.00,cementing my and J.T.'sfriendship.
414,00:24:54.79,00:24:54.79,"And I know that it makes me looklike his goofy, awkward,"
415,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,"right-hand man.But if he thinks I'm the goofy,"
416,00:25:01.08,00:25:01.08,"awkward right-hand man, he'sgoing to want to keep me around"
417,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,longer.There's something inside here.
418,00:25:24.08,00:25:24.08,">> When Jalapao tribe picked meto go to Exile, I was totally"
419,00:25:27.12,00:25:27.12,psyched.I wanted the chance to get the
420,00:25:28.46,00:25:28.46,"immunity idol.Rice, awesome."
421,00:25:31.33,00:25:31.33,And also to come to Exile withsomebody from the other tribe
422,00:25:34.25,00:25:34.25,is a great opportunity to learnsome information.
423,00:25:41.92,00:25:41.92,">> ""You must each choose anurn."""
424,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,>> You go first.>> All right.
425,00:25:47.62,00:25:47.62,"Once Brendan and I made it toExile Island, we found two"
426,00:25:50.46,00:25:50.46,"urns, and there was a messagethat we both had to choose one."
427,00:25:56.92,00:25:56.92,There's nothing in mine.>> Uh-oh.
428,00:26:01.12,00:26:01.12,"""Open in private."">> Oh, crap!"
429,00:26:03.92,00:26:03.92,>> Can you give me a moment?>> Take a second.
430,00:26:06.75,00:26:06.75,"We only have two cups.>> ""Congratulations."
431,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,You now have the clue to hiddenimmunity idol.
432,00:26:13.29,00:26:13.29,It's up to you whether youshare this information with
433,00:26:15.17,00:26:15.17,"anyone else.""I opened up my cup and it had"
434,00:26:20.50,00:26:20.50,two notes in it.The first note was the first
435,00:26:24.00,00:26:24.00,"clue to find the immunity idol.""If you want to be safe, snoop"
436,00:26:28.04,00:26:28.04,"around, take a peek, but intribal homelands is the thing"
437,00:26:31.58,00:26:31.58,"that you seek.""The tribal homelands?"
438,00:26:35.33,00:26:35.33,I kind of look at this as anawesome thing to get sent to
439,00:26:37.75,00:26:37.75,Exile this early in the game.I just have to figure out where
440,00:26:40.33,00:26:40.33,"the tribal homelands are.""Also you have a choice before"
441,00:26:42.83,00:26:42.83,you.At the end of your stay at
442,00:26:44.58,00:26:44.58,"Exile, you can return to thetribe you just left or you"
443,00:26:46.92,00:26:46.92,can join the other tribe.This is a big decision.
444,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,"It has potential to turn thisgame on its head."""
445,00:26:52.12,00:26:52.12,That it does.The second note was saying that
446,00:26:55.21,00:26:55.21,I had the ability to switchtribes.
447,00:26:57.00,00:26:57.00,"No chance, no chance I'll goto Jalapao."
448,00:27:02.00,00:27:02.00,Let me see it. I just want tosee what it looks like.
449,00:27:07.12,00:27:07.12,"...with writing on it.I'm gonna go take a walk,"
450,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,though.>> Do you want me to help you
451,00:27:11.21,00:27:11.21,find it?It's yours.
452,00:27:12.29,00:27:12.29,">> You can walk with me, yeah.>> Yeah, I don't want to sit"
453,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,here by myself.I'm working Brendan to give
454,00:27:16.50,00:27:16.50,myself a chance to find theidol.
455,00:27:18.96,00:27:18.96,So I'm like trying to be realnice.
456,00:27:20.75,00:27:20.75,I'm playing up the friendlyaspect because when my tribe
457,00:27:23.04,00:27:23.04,found out who my husbandactually is-- Eddie George from
458,00:27:26.12,00:27:26.12,"the NFL-- I could just tellthat they were thinking,"
459,00:27:28.08,00:27:28.08,"""Well, she doesn't need this.We need it."""
460,00:27:29.12,00:27:29.12,Everybody thinks they have agreat cause.
461,00:27:30.42,00:27:30.42,"Hell, my cause is I want it andI'm going to stay here and get"
462,00:27:32.58,00:27:32.58,"it.""If you want to be safe, snoop"
463,00:27:44.62,00:27:44.62,"around, take a peek, but in thetribal homelands is the thing"
464,00:27:47.88,00:27:47.88,"that you seek."">> Does that make any sense?"
465,00:27:52.54,00:27:52.54,>> I think our homelands arewhere we live.
466,00:27:55.25,00:27:55.25,">> Oh, you're right.At that point, when I realized"
467,00:27:58.42,00:27:58.42,"the idol was somewhere back atthe tribe camps, I was thinking"
468,00:28:02.21,00:28:02.21,there's two hidden immunityidols.
469,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,"There's one in our camp, andone in Jalapao's camp, and it's"
470,00:28:06.62,00:28:06.62,not the same idol that Sierrawas looking for.
471,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,"Do you have, like, a buddy onyour team?"
472,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,>> I haven't really bonded withanyone yet.
473,00:28:13.92,00:28:13.92,"So we have to bond.>> Seriously, I'm all for that."
474,00:28:16.92,00:28:16.92,">> We have to bond.>> So when you go back, will you"
475,00:28:19.21,00:28:19.21,tell other people it's in yourhomeland?
476,00:28:21.17,00:28:21.17,">> Probably not.See, I'm thinking I need to save"
477,00:28:23.96,00:28:23.96,myself from my tribe.>> Yeah.
478,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,"I'm an entrepreneur, andhaving your own business, you"
479,00:28:28.33,00:28:28.33,have to make people understandwho you are and make them feel
480,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,"that, you know what, we canwork together."
481,00:28:33.33,00:28:33.33,And Taj and I created a greatbond that could be very helpful
482,00:28:36.92,00:28:36.92,for both of us if we do get tothe merge.
483,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"So if we do rendezvous later inthe game, I think we will have"
484,00:28:41.71,00:28:41.71,a relationship in place.The goal is that we both get to
485,00:28:45.12,00:28:45.12,get sent back here.>> That's perfect.
486,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,">> Hopefully, that will give usthe next clue where it is in"
487,00:28:50.08,00:28:50.08,our homeland.So we need to work together.
488,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,>> Yeah.>> Does that work?
489,00:28:53.62,00:28:53.62,>> That works for me.We're going to try it.
490,00:28:55.21,00:28:55.21,">> That works?>> Oh, yeah."
491,00:29:03.12,00:29:03.12,">> You guys, this is reallygood."
492,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,>> You got a big chunk out ofyour elbow right there.
493,00:29:07.75,00:29:07.75,">> That's where that young kidtackled me, man."
494,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,>> I am shocked at that littleold lady.
495,00:29:11.96,00:29:11.96,">> Yeah, they almost drowned meat one point."
496,00:29:15.33,00:29:15.33,">> It was a very toughchallenge, and it got really"
497,00:29:17.42,00:29:17.42,"physical.So when we lost, I was very"
498,00:29:20.12,00:29:20.12,disappointed.I hate to lose because
499,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,"somebody is going home.>> Honestly, I didn't see Coach"
500,00:29:28.29,00:29:28.29,playing that hard.He barely tackled anyone.
501,00:29:31.67,00:29:31.67,"He didn't fight to get free.We need action, not words."
502,00:29:36.00,00:29:36.00,">> I feel like I'm dealing withone of the, like, church women"
503,00:29:38.46,00:29:38.46,"at my church that go everySunday and wear these hats,"
504,00:29:41.38,00:29:41.38,"but they ain't on the up-and-up.That's what I feel like, you"
505,00:29:44.92,00:29:44.92,know.Coach is not excelling
506,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,physically in the way thatI thought he would.
507,00:29:52.54,00:29:52.54,"And at the end of the day, Ireally don't see, like, what"
508,00:29:56.12,00:29:56.12,all Coach is bringing to thetable except a lot of talk.
509,00:30:11.75,00:30:11.75,">> You know what I mean,big-time right now."
510,00:30:14.25,00:30:14.25,I don't know.I just... I don't like to be
511,00:30:16.54,00:30:16.54,"around negativity, and if we'vegot negative going on in the"
512,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,"group, it's going to bereally tough for me."
513,00:30:21.50,00:30:21.50,>> This kind of stuff thatyou're telling me makes me
514,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,worried because who would go?>> I thought earlier we'd all
515,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,"decided Sierra.>> Yeah, I know, but what I'm"
516,00:30:30.75,00:30:30.75,"thinking is this: I do wantthe strong people to be here,"
517,00:30:33.88,00:30:33.88,but I mean the poisoned appleneeds to go because it's going
518,00:30:36.04,00:30:36.04,to ruin the bunch.At first I thought I'm going
519,00:30:38.96,00:30:38.96,"with the plan and vote forSierra, and now Candace is..."
520,00:30:41.54,00:30:41.54,"boy, talk about cancer on theteam."
521,00:30:44.71,00:30:44.71,"Just the negative attitude, Ithink everybody's pretty much"
522,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,"fed up with it.And, you know, sometimes there"
523,00:30:49.83,00:30:49.83,is addition by subtraction.She got on me.
524,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,She's going to get on everybody.The cancer will ruin the tribe.
525,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,">> Oh, man, my man!>> Hey!"
526,00:31:13.83,00:31:13.83,">> All right!>> Oh, my God."
527,00:31:16.71,00:31:16.71,">> How you doing, man?>> Good."
528,00:31:18.29,00:31:18.29,">> What's going on, big guy?>> Have you eaten anything?"
529,00:31:20.46,00:31:20.46,">> Yeah, we had rice.We got a fire."
530,00:31:22.12,00:31:22.12,We slept outside.And it's just this giant dune
531,00:31:24.25,00:31:24.25,that comes out of the middle ofnowhere.
532,00:31:25.75,00:31:25.75,>> So how did you both look forthe idol at the same time?
533,00:31:28.67,00:31:28.67,>> There's two urns...>> Uh-huh.
534,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,">> You each get to pick an urn,and mine was empty and hers"
535,00:31:32.67,00:31:32.67,had a clue.And I was setting up camp.
536,00:31:35.38,00:31:35.38,"She went back up, came backdown, but she never really said"
537,00:31:37.96,00:31:37.96,if she got it or not.>> You didn't charm the
538,00:31:39.92,00:31:39.92,clue out of her?>> I don't know; she is clearly
539,00:31:41.88,00:31:41.88,on the outs with her tribe.>> Really?
540,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,">> You think?>> Yeah, that's what she said."
541,00:31:46.04,00:31:46.04,The idol is actually undereverybody's nose in camp.
542,00:31:50.00,00:31:50.00,I don't want to let that out ofthe bag yet.
543,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,"It's one very general clue,and that's too broad."
544,00:31:55.92,00:31:55.92,"So you know, I'll be patientand just hope the clues keep"
545,00:31:58.79,00:31:58.79,falling into my lap.>> Who's that somebody going to
546,00:32:07.46,00:32:07.46,"be?>> Oh, yeah."
547,00:32:13.83,00:32:13.83,"Like, he's a big guy, and helooks like he's in good shape,"
548,00:32:16.38,00:32:16.38,"but I just haven't seen it yet.>> But, I mean, I don't know"
549,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"how soon we can do it.I don't know if this Council,"
550,00:32:22.58,00:32:22.58,it might be too soon.>> Yeah.
551,00:32:25.08,00:32:25.08,>> I think if we just staychilled and let him keep
552,00:32:27.79,00:32:27.79,digging his hole.>> Yeah.
553,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,>> So then the sad part issomebody has to go.
554,00:32:32.46,00:32:32.46,>> Yeah.>> Everyone has their strengths
555,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,and their weaknesses.We just need to do what makes
556,00:32:40.88,00:32:40.88,the team stronger.>> You're right about that.
557,00:32:44.92,00:32:44.92,">> What do you think, Coach?>> The original plan when we"
558,00:32:55.75,00:32:55.75,walked into camp was to go withSierra.
559,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,">> Okay, got it.I didn't know how original"
560,00:32:59.46,00:32:59.46,"we were talking.I'm like, wait a minute."
561,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,Is there a new original plan?>> We're going to Tribal
562,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,Council.And the girls think
563,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,"that everybody is voting forSierra, but for me, the obvious"
564,00:33:09.92,00:33:09.92,choice is Candace.She's just a cancer on the
565,00:33:11.75,00:33:11.75,tribe.I've been looking forward to
566,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,this elimination.I think it's good.
567,00:33:16.29,00:33:16.29,"I think it's what we need.So hopefully, Candace has her"
568,00:33:18.75,00:33:18.75,bags packed because she's out ofhere.
569,00:33:31.42,00:33:31.42,">> How about you?>> Yeah, that..."
570,00:33:33.54,00:33:33.54,She crossed my mind.Sierra was on my mind at first.
571,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,">> Coach, he wants to get ridof Candace."
572,00:33:42.42,00:33:42.42,"You know, I didn't necessarilythink he was right."
573,00:33:44.46,00:33:44.46,"In the challenge yesterday, ashard as Sierra played, I think"
574,00:33:48.71,00:33:48.71,that she's just too small forsomething like that.
575,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"Every time I saw her, she wastrying her hardest, but"
576,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33,somebody was holding her down.So I think there's going to be
577,00:33:58.12,00:33:58.12,some challenges that probablywould suit Candace better than
578,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,"they would Sierra.We need to keep the strongest,"
579,00:34:03.54,00:34:03.54,happiest tribe we can.>> Yeah.
580,00:34:11.62,00:34:11.62,>> I will not vote you offtonight.
581,00:34:14.08,00:34:14.08,">> I feel like it's my time,it's my time."
582,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,>> I'm going to tell yousomething.
583,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,I make my living off of peopletrusting me.
584,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33,So you just have to be cooland relax.
585,00:34:27.54,00:34:27.54,">> Coach told me I wasn't goingto get voted out, but I know"
586,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"that my whole tribe, from thebeginning, wanted to vote me"
587,00:34:34.96,00:34:34.96,"off, so I'm freaking out alittle bit about that."
588,00:34:37.58,00:34:37.58,>> Stop worrying.>> I'm not worrying.
589,00:34:39.71,00:34:39.71,>> You are worrying.You can't say you're not
590,00:34:41.25,00:34:41.25,worrying.I know you're worrying.
591,00:34:44.00,00:34:44.00,>> I am not comfortable at all.I still have not found the
592,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,"hidden immunity idol.So, I'm still looking behind my"
593,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,back.>> That's a long time for
594,00:34:58.08,00:34:58.08,people to be rallying.>> Mm-hmm.
595,00:35:03.29,00:35:03.29,">> I don't know.>> Okay, let's think about this."
596,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,You and I are both strong.>> Yeah.
597,00:35:09.21,00:35:09.21,>> The guys have been talkingabout voting Sierra off for
598,00:35:11.58,00:35:11.58,"days.>> Okay, I worry about the fact"
599,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,"that, like, if anybody strays alittle bit, like..."
600,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,">> Listen, I'm going to tell youright now."
601,00:35:19.33,00:35:19.33,It ain't you or me.They know what we're worth.
602,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,"As far as I know, it's Sierragoing home."
603,00:35:26.75,00:35:26.75,"And if it's not, then there'smad shadiness going on around"
604,00:35:31.12,00:35:31.12,this tribe.>> Yeah.
605,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,>> Everybody trying to figureit out.
606,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,>> And this is just thebeginning.
607,00:35:42.04,00:35:42.04,>> I know it.>> PROBST: Behind each of you
608,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,is a torch.Go ahead and grab a torch.
609,00:36:06.75,00:36:06.75,"Approach the flame, dip it in,and get fire."
610,00:36:12.33,00:36:12.33,"This is part of the ritual ofTribal Council because, in this"
611,00:36:14.92,00:36:14.92,"game, fire represents your life.As long as you have fire,"
612,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,"you're still in the game.When your fire's gone, so are"
613,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,you.Let's go back to the very
614,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"beginning.Sierra, based on very little"
615,00:36:26.96,00:36:26.96,"information, you were voted outof this tribe."
616,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,What was going through yourmind at that moment?
617,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,">> Um, a part of me wanted togive up for a second."
618,00:36:35.04,00:36:35.04,"It was written all over my facethat I was sick, so I"
619,00:36:38.38,00:36:38.38,automatically looked weak fromthe get-go.
620,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"So I think their vote was valid.>> PROBST: Tyson, what was your"
621,00:36:43.75,00:36:43.75,reaction to Sierra?>> She kind of looked miserable
622,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,on the truck.I didn't see her pull
623,00:36:48.08,00:36:48.08,anything off.I didn't see her gather very
624,00:36:49.88,00:36:49.88,much.She seemed to be struggling in
625,00:36:51.21,00:36:51.21,"the heat and didn't seem veryhappy, so..."
626,00:36:55.12,00:36:55.12,">> PROBST: Candace, how muchtime was spent talking about"
627,00:36:57.12,00:36:57.12,Sierra and why everybody votedfor her?
628,00:36:59.54,00:36:59.54,">> Honestly, there was a littlebit of resentment because it was"
629,00:37:02.00,00:37:02.00,such a difficult trek and shewas taking a helicopter ride.
630,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,And I think she really wasn'tthat excited to be here or
631,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,wanted to be here as much aseveryone else.
632,00:37:12.12,00:37:12.12,">> PROBST: And what do youthink the vibe is on you,"
633,00:37:13.92,00:37:13.92,overall?>> I think I'm vibing with the
634,00:37:16.54,00:37:16.54,"group, but it's like, you neverknow."
635,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"I mean, sometimes I talk alot, and maybe that might be"
636,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,misinterpreted.We're all different.
637,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"It's hard to tell.>> PROBST: Coach, do you think"
638,00:37:26.08,00:37:26.08,anybody would tell you thisearly in the game if you didn't
639,00:37:28.46,00:37:28.46,"mesh?>> At this point, you got to"
640,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,go with your intuition.And if you're clashing with
641,00:37:33.08,00:37:33.08,"somebody, you've got to sensethat on your own because I guess"
642,00:37:36.12,00:37:36.12,"at this stage, nobody is goingto tell you that."
643,00:37:38.79,00:37:38.79,>> PROBST: Let's talk a littleabout Exile Island.
644,00:37:40.83,00:37:40.83,"Brendan, how was Exile?>> Um, it wasn't exactly"
645,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"luxurious by any means, but itwas a cool experience to go"
646,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,check out and have a chance tokind of go there with Taj and go
647,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,"through the process of Exile.>> PROBST: So, Coach, how"
648,00:37:53.96,00:37:53.96,curious was everybody aboutBrendan's stay on Exile?
649,00:37:56.92,00:37:56.92,">> Right off the bat, he saidthere were two jars, and one of"
650,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,them had a clue to look for theidol and the other one didn't.
651,00:38:01.67,00:38:01.67,He didn't get the clue.And that's somebody that I
652,00:38:04.88,00:38:04.88,respect and trust and I believe100% when he tells me something.
653,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,">> PROBST: Jerry, are yousurprised how quickly trust is"
654,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,a major issue in this game?You barely know these people.
655,00:38:15.75,00:38:15.75,">> Jeff, yes, trust is a majorissue in this game."
656,00:38:19.88,00:38:19.88,"Because if you can win the trustof over half the tribe, then"
657,00:38:22.29,00:38:22.29,"you'll be here for a while.But if you can't win the trust,"
658,00:38:24.75,00:38:24.75,your time here is going to belimited.
659,00:38:26.88,00:38:26.88,>> PROBST: Hard to make a votethis early on?
660,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,>> It's really hard to make avote this early on.
661,00:38:30.58,00:38:30.58,"I've bonded with this group ofindividuals so closely, and"
662,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50,"we've got to know each otherreal, I mean, real well."
663,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,">> PROBST: Erinn, what are youreacting to?"
664,00:38:38.71,00:38:38.71,>> We can talk all day abouthow much we all get along and
665,00:38:42.50,00:38:42.50,"this, that and the other thing,but we don't know these people."
666,00:38:44.62,00:38:44.62,We've known them for six days.But I don't know if the person
667,00:38:47.75,00:38:47.75,I've bonded with is who youreally are.
668,00:38:49.46,00:38:49.46,I just think we need to becareful.
669,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,>> I have to disagree withErinn.
670,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,We're not at the Holiday Inn.We are out there surviving
671,00:38:56.12,00:38:56.12,"together.That trek that we went through,"
672,00:38:58.67,00:38:58.67,to me that's how you really getto know someone.
673,00:39:00.88,00:39:00.88,>> But I don't know that that'show you get to trust someone.
674,00:39:03.25,00:39:03.25,">> Well, I've already builttrust."
675,00:39:05.12,00:39:05.12,I've built trust with severalpeople on this tribe.
676,00:39:09.21,00:39:09.21,">> PROBST: All right, it is timeto vote."
677,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,"Tyson, you're up.>> You played a great physical"
678,00:39:39.12,00:39:39.12,"game, but nobody wants a snakein the grass."
679,00:40:13.25,00:40:13.25,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
680,00:40:28.33,00:40:28.33,>> PROBST: If anybody has thehidden immunity idol and you
681,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"want to play it, now would bethe time to do so."
682,00:40:36.12,00:40:36.12,"All right.Once the votes are read,"
683,00:40:38.25,00:40:38.25,the decision is final.The person voted out will be
684,00:40:40.04,00:40:40.04,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
685,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,I'll read the votes.First vote: Candace.

695,00:41:52.12,00:41:52.12,"Well, your first TribalCouncil, your first blindside."

712,00:42:48.12,00:42:48.12,I worked on camp.And I did everything I could
713,00:42:51.08,00:42:51.08,to try to make Timbira stronger.And I thought that that was the
714,00:42:54.12,00:42:54.12,goal.But I guess this is more like
715,00:42:56.46,00:42:56.46,"day camp.In the long run, I was an asset"
716,00:42:58.92,00:42:58.92,and they're going to need me.
