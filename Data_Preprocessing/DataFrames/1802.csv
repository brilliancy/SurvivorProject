2,00:00:02.21,00:00:02.21,Survivor: Two tribes-- Jalapao in red and
3,00:00:06.42,00:00:06.42,Timbira in black-- were stranded in Brazil's Tocantins.
4,00:00:10.04,00:00:10.04,Take a look around-- Brazilian highlands.
5,00:00:12.17,00:00:12.17,"Beautiful part of Brazil, but extremely harsh."
6,00:00:16.12,00:00:16.12,(thunder rumbles) One person from each tribe is
7,00:00:20.17,00:00:20.17,"not going to make this journey. Based only on first impressions,"
8,00:00:23.79,00:00:23.79,the tribes believed they were voting out one of their own.
9,00:00:27.21,00:00:27.21,">> Zebra-striped top. >> Sierra, head over."
10,00:00:29.42,00:00:29.42,">> Older lady. >> PROBST: Sandy, you can't be"
11,00:00:31.38,00:00:31.38,happy about this. >> I'm pissed.
12,00:00:32.92,00:00:32.92,>> PROBST: But the game wasn't over for Sandy and Sierra.
13,00:00:36.12,00:00:36.12,They had only been voted off the trek.
14,00:00:38.71,00:00:38.71,"They were flown to their tribe camps in a helicopter, leaving"
15,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,their unhappy tribe mates to walk for hours.
16,00:00:45.62,00:00:45.62,">> This thing is getting heavy. I mean, really heavy."
17,00:00:49.08,00:00:49.08,">> PROBST: Alone in their camps, Sandy and Sierra"
18,00:00:51.96,00:00:51.96,discovered a clue to a hidden immunity idol.
19,00:00:54.50,00:00:54.50,">> People may think this is a really stupid idea, but..."
20,00:00:57.21,00:00:57.21,">> PROBST: Instead of searching for the idol, Sierra decided to"
21,00:01:00.21,00:01:00.21,"win over the Timbira tribe with hard work, which might have"
22,00:01:03.33,00:01:03.33,"succeeded. >> Well, you know, Sierra, we"
23,00:01:05.46,00:01:05.46,all love her. >> PROBST: Or not.
24,00:01:06.88,00:01:06.88,">> But even though she's awesome, she's got to go."
25,00:01:09.04,00:01:09.04,>> PROBST: Sandy searched for the idol at Jalapao and came up
26,00:01:12.12,00:01:12.12,short. >> Wonder what a pace is.
27,00:01:14.00,00:01:14.00,>> PROBST: Putting her in danger.
28,00:01:15.75,00:01:15.75,Carolina struggling to stay up. (cheering)
29,00:01:19.96,00:01:19.96,But when Jalapao suffered their first loss...
30,00:01:22.58,00:01:22.58,"Jalapao, Tribal Council tonight. The first person will be voted"
31,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,"out of this game, and it's coming from your tribe."
32,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,...Sandy was in deep trouble. But Carolina's bossiness...
33,00:01:33.21,00:01:33.21,>> Let's try to get everything done as soon as possible.
34,00:01:36.17,00:01:36.17,"When it comes to, like, working, I can get very"
35,00:01:38.38,00:01:38.38,opinionated. >> PROBST: ...made for a
36,00:01:39.88,00:01:39.88,"surprise decision. Carolina, the tribe has spoken."
37,00:01:43.08,00:01:43.08,Sandy narrowly escaped. Can she survive another week?
38,00:01:47.42,00:01:47.42,15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
39,00:01:55.25,00:01:55.25,>> Look around the outside of... (chattering quietly)
40,00:02:06.00,00:02:06.00,>> It's not like we just picked randomly.
41,00:02:08.04,00:02:08.04,">> No, I know. >> I made it through Tribal"
42,00:02:09.88,00:02:09.88,"Council by a landslide. I think Carolina played her, uh,"
43,00:02:13.71,00:02:13.71,"cards terribly wrong, and so she's kept me in this game so"
44,00:02:17.54,00:02:17.54,far. (Sandy laughs)
45,00:02:21.50,00:02:21.50,"Lord, thank you! That's our boy."
46,00:02:23.96,00:02:23.96,"He said, ""We're going to have fire,"" didn't you, honey?"
47,00:02:26.71,00:02:26.71,I believe I'm underestimated in this game.
48,00:02:29.08,00:02:29.08,"I want to win this thing. And as long as I'm here, I can"
49,00:02:32.50,00:02:32.50,win it. Thank you all so much for
50,00:02:35.12,00:02:35.12,letting me hang in here with you all for a few more days.
51,00:02:37.54,00:02:37.54,">> We just did what's best for the team, you know."
52,00:02:39.71,00:02:39.71,">> Oh, thank you so much. >> Now that Carolina is out, I"
53,00:02:42.38,00:02:42.38,"mean, we all pretty much agreed that she just swapped places"
54,00:02:45.33,00:02:45.33,with Sandy. Sandy was going to be first
55,00:02:47.92,00:02:47.92,and then Carolina after that. Now Carolina was first and now
56,00:02:50.79,00:02:50.79,Sandy after that.  Captioning sponsored by

60,00:04:18.29,00:04:18.29,Joe. >> Try that.
61,00:04:18.92,00:04:18.92,">> Oh, my God. >> Maybe a little longer,"
62,00:04:20.42,00:04:20.42,I think. >> We need some protein.
63,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,We need protein in a bad way right now.
64,00:04:29.42,00:04:29.42,>> Yeah. >> Yes.
65,00:04:30.79,00:04:30.79,">> I don't know if the whole tribe's up for it, but we're"
66,00:04:33.08,00:04:33.08,going to eat some termites today.
67,00:04:35.92,00:04:35.92,"All right, so there was a couple of mounds over here."
68,00:04:37.75,00:04:37.75,There's a mound right there. >> Should we just open them up
69,00:04:40.04,00:04:40.04,and pick them up? >> Most definitely.
70,00:04:41.50,00:04:41.50,">> All right, ready? >> Yeah."
71,00:04:47.50,00:04:47.50,">> Ew, what's all them, termites?"
72,00:04:50.04,00:04:50.04,">> Oh, yeah, those are termites. >> Oh, that's wild."
73,00:04:53.29,00:04:53.29,>> I've never been in a situation where I've been
74,00:04:55.58,00:04:55.58,deprived of food for a long period of time.
75,00:04:57.79,00:04:57.79,"I'm a teenager, and I'm used to having those, those comfort"
76,00:05:01.21,00:05:01.21,"foods at home, where if I'm hungry, I can eat whenever I"
77,00:05:04.21,00:05:04.21,"want. And out here, if I want a"
78,00:05:05.79,00:05:05.79,"snack, I'm going to have to go find something."
79,00:05:07.33,00:05:07.33,"Nuh-uh, buddy, you're coming to Papa."
80,00:05:11.54,00:05:11.54,"(Joe grunts) >> Ah, ay-yo!"
81,00:05:14.58,00:05:14.58,Holy cow! Look at that big one!
82,00:05:16.38,00:05:16.38,>> I got to have that for fishing.
83,00:05:18.00,00:05:18.00,">> Oh, get... no, no. Eat that."
84,00:05:19.04,00:05:19.04,">> Just throw it in there. >> Okay, all right."
85,00:05:21.04,00:05:21.04,">> Sweet mother of... Hey, Steve!"
86,00:05:24.17,00:05:24.17,>> Should we cut it first or just bite into it?
87,00:05:26.25,00:05:26.25,>> Eat it. >> Bite the head off.
88,00:05:27.79,00:05:27.79,>> Bite the head off. >> You want the head or the
89,00:05:29.71,00:05:29.71,tail? >> He wants to bite the head
90,00:05:31.12,00:05:31.12,off. >> Just me and you splitting it?
91,00:05:32.75,00:05:32.75,">> Get you some, man. >> Ooh."
92,00:05:36.21,00:05:36.21,">> Oh, God. >> Oh, God."
93,00:05:37.96,00:05:37.96,>> It's tough. (groaning)
94,00:05:39.58,00:05:39.58,">> Whoo! >> Oh, that's nasty."
95,00:05:41.17,00:05:41.17,">> Your teeth are covered. >> Oh, God."
96,00:05:44.04,00:05:44.04,"It's tough, man. You got to chew."
97,00:05:45.50,00:05:45.50,Bite it. Bite it. >> Bite that sucker.
98,00:05:48.42,00:05:48.42,I love it! >> Maybe I'll just wait.
99,00:05:51.12,00:05:51.12,>> I didn't try the worm. After I saw Stephen's face...
100,00:05:54.83,00:05:54.83,(groans) Uh-uh.
101,00:05:57.04,00:05:57.04,"I mean, I'll eat one at a challenge if I need to, but not"
102,00:05:59.17,00:05:59.17,"in real life. >> So good, so good."
103,00:06:12.12,00:06:12.12,">> Gonna go, like, one of those. Come on, come on, come on, come"
104,00:06:19.12,00:06:19.12,"on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come"
105,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"on, come on. Don't."
106,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"All right, breakfast is after noon."
107,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,"(chuckles) >> Day one, my tribe tried to"
108,00:06:30.58,00:06:30.58,vote me out. I think they all perceive me
109,00:06:33.58,00:06:33.58,"as the weakest link. And instead, I came here and"
110,00:06:37.08,00:06:37.08,"there was a clue for a hidden immunity idol, but I haven't"
111,00:06:40.58,00:06:40.58,had a chance to look for it. I'm still on the outs in my
112,00:06:44.04,00:06:44.04,"tribe, so I most definitely need to find it."
113,00:06:47.62,00:06:47.62,And I need someone to help me with that.
114,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,"In this game, you need people on your side."
115,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,And Brendan's the one person that didn't vote for me.
116,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17,So he was the one I trusted the most.
117,00:07:06.58,00:07:06.58,>> I'm glad you did. Thank you.
118,00:07:13.08,00:07:13.08,"Oh, really? All right, but totally got"
119,00:07:16.08,00:07:16.08,your back. Sierra needed some help to
120,00:07:18.79,00:07:18.79,figure this out. I think she didn't necessarily
121,00:07:20.96,00:07:20.96,feel comfortable that the tribe was not going to vote her off
122,00:07:23.58,00:07:23.58,"in the first Tribal Council, and I think it's important"
123,00:07:26.50,00:07:26.50,taking a look for. It can't hurt.
124,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,">> The first clue, it said, ""The stick marks the spot on"
125,00:07:36.21,00:07:36.21,your biggest beach. Dig for a while and assistance
126,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,"you'll reach."" Oh, I got it!"
127,00:07:46.04,00:07:46.04,"Oh, my God. Okay."
128,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,"""With your back to the river, walk towards the lone tree."
129,00:07:54.08,00:07:54.08,"Dig after ten paces at the place where you'll be."""
130,00:08:07.04,00:08:07.04,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
131,00:08:23.08,00:08:23.08,>> We'll probably figure it out when we get there.
132,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,>> Should I go check on Brendan and Sierra and make sure
133,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,they're still alive? >> Go.
134,00:08:29.00,00:08:29.00,I'll wait here. >> I just wanted to make sure
135,00:08:41.21,00:08:41.21,you all were alive. Cool!
136,00:08:48.88,00:08:48.88,"I love it! Oh, how cool is this?"
137,00:08:51.46,00:08:51.46,You guys have worked your tails off.
138,00:08:54.21,00:08:54.21,">> Debbie caught us. Luckily, Sierra had the idea of"
139,00:08:57.54,00:08:57.54,"saying that we're building a fire pit, which I thought that"
140,00:08:59.25,00:08:59.25,"was really smart. Uh, and just kind of went with"
141,00:09:02.25,00:09:02.25,it. >> This is so cool.
142,00:09:03.12,00:09:03.12,"This will be fun. >> It'll be good, right?"
143,00:09:04.67,00:09:04.67,>> Yeah! We can pretend we're at the
144,00:09:06.12,00:09:06.12,beach somewhere. >> Debbie's so fun-loving.
145,00:09:08.33,00:09:08.33,"She was all about it. I mean, she was our best"
146,00:09:11.21,00:09:11.21,salesperson. >> Wait till you see what
147,00:09:14.04,00:09:14.04,Brendan and Sierra built. A massive fire pit for a
148,00:09:17.17,00:09:17.17,big beach fire tonight. >> Really?
149,00:09:19.17,00:09:19.17,>> I just don't think it makes that much sense.
150,00:09:21.12,00:09:21.12,"I probably won't go, you know. I'd rather sit around here and"
151,00:09:25.04,00:09:25.04,talk crap. >> All right.
152,00:09:28.33,00:09:28.33,>> We were so close to getting caught.
153,00:09:30.79,00:09:30.79,"It may be a stupid move, but to tell you the truth, I don't"
154,00:09:33.17,00:09:33.17,think it worth it to continue looking for the hidden
155,00:09:35.92,00:09:35.92,"immunity idol, even though I know where I stand in this camp"
156,00:09:39.79,00:09:39.79,"with these people, and I'm really worried about my"
157,00:09:42.08,00:09:42.08,position. >> Are you hungry?
158,00:10:05.62,00:10:05.62,">> I was thinking I really want to steam, like, big, like, sea"
159,00:10:10.08,00:10:10.08,"bass with, like, some olive oil and fresh lime juice and wrap it"
160,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,up in aluminum foil and just let it steam.
161,00:10:17.75,00:10:17.75,Are you serious? (laughs)
162,00:10:22.04,00:10:22.04,>> Are we going to do rice at the same time?
163,00:10:28.25,00:10:28.25,>> That's fine with me. >> The problem with that though
164,00:10:30.75,00:10:30.75,"is with the beans, you got to have them in water."
165,00:10:33.08,00:10:33.08,"What happens with the rice is that the rice soaks it all up,"
166,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,and I'm afraid you're gonna burn stuff.
167,00:10:36.58,00:10:36.58,>> You can just add water as you go.
168,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17,>> Think it's gonna be undercooked or it's gonna be
169,00:10:39.88,00:10:39.88,overcooked. >> Do you want to cook?
170,00:10:41.79,00:10:41.79,I'm gonna tell you right now. It's either gonna be under-
171,00:10:43.67,00:10:43.67,"or overcooked. >> You know what, we've been"
172,00:10:45.04,00:10:45.04,waiting three days to eat. If I wait 20 more minutes for
173,00:10:47.33,00:10:47.33,"rice to get cooked, it doesn't matter to me."
174,00:10:49.04,00:10:49.04,"But you're the one doing the cooking, so..."
175,00:10:50.58,00:10:50.58,>> I'm just telling you it's not gonna be perfect.
176,00:10:52.17,00:10:52.17,>> You want to put everything in the same pot.
177,00:10:53.67,00:10:53.67,"So you guys want to do that, no problem."
178,00:10:56.25,00:10:56.25,"Candace, she has a personality like mine."
179,00:10:59.08,00:10:59.08,She looks to find faults in other people.
180,00:11:00.96,00:11:00.96,"I do it because I'm-I'm a coach, and I do it because that's my"
181,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,job. And I think that maybe she just
182,00:11:04.67,00:11:04.67,does it 'cause that's her nature.
183,00:11:06.46,00:11:06.46,">> You're taking out, um, I think, some frustration..."
184,00:11:08.12,00:11:08.12,">> No, you're taking out frustration."
185,00:11:09.62,00:11:09.62,You asked my opinion about the rice and beans.
186,00:11:12.04,00:11:12.04,"That's what I think. >> I am an educated woman, and I"
187,00:11:15.62,00:11:15.62,don't take crap from people. And Coach comes over feeling
188,00:11:18.67,00:11:18.67,"like he's the expert. In real life, like, I would have"
189,00:11:21.75,00:11:21.75,"broke it down, like, to his psyche, you know, and his"

380,00:22:56.38,00:22:56.38,>> Jalapao! >> Today we won immunity and
381,00:22:59.62,00:22:59.62,"fishing gear, which included a casting net, a couple fishing"
382,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,"poles, a spear and some hooks and stuff like that, so"
383,00:23:05.33,00:23:05.33,we're looking forward to spending our day without Tribal
384,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,Council going to try to find some fish.
385,00:23:10.33,00:23:10.33,We need a physical challenge like that.
386,00:23:14.25,00:23:14.25,>> To be the winning tribe feels phenomenal.
387,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,"If we lost immunity, there was probably a 50% chance of me"
388,00:23:20.83,00:23:20.83,"going home. But we won, and I'm here for"
389,00:23:23.83,00:23:23.83,another several more days. >> A net-- a cast net.
390,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,>> Just ease out here about waist deep.
391,00:23:31.79,00:23:31.79,We have to figure out how to throw it so it spreads out when
392,00:23:34.25,00:23:34.25,it hits and you can catch bait fish that way.
393,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,>> J.T. has definitely emerged as our tribe leader and
394,00:23:41.04,00:23:41.04,"honestly, I'm thrilled to be out here with him."
395,00:23:43.71,00:23:43.71,He's like no one I would have met back at home and I
396,00:23:46.04,00:23:46.04,"think we're getting to know each other, which I thought is sort"
397,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,of surprising because he's the Alabama country boy.
398,00:23:52.12,00:23:52.12,"He is Tom Sawyer, and I am the angsty city boy."
399,00:23:56.33,00:23:56.33,"He might just be seducing me with his pretty country ways,"
400,00:23:59.04,00:23:59.04,but I'm smitten. >> You take the loose end...
401,00:24:05.12,00:24:05.12,>> Yeah. >> You go back through that
402,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,hole and back through that hole you just created.
403,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,>> I see. >> What you'll do is just hold
404,00:24:13.58,00:24:13.58,"it until you feel them, and then just snatch it."
405,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,Stephen and I come from different walks of life.
406,00:24:18.79,00:24:18.79,He's definitely a city boy and I'm an south Alabama cattle
407,00:24:21.54,00:24:21.54,farmer. But we get along really well.
408,00:24:23.50,00:24:23.50,So we have a good friendship. >> I'm going to become the
409,00:24:25.75,00:24:25.75,greatest spear fisherman that ever existed.
410,00:24:40.12,00:24:40.12,"Oh, my God! They're right here."
411,00:24:43.12,00:24:43.12,"There was, like, four or five of them."
412,00:24:46.71,00:24:46.71,We had some luck in seeing fish. Not so much in catching the
413,00:24:49.17,00:24:49.17,"fish, but I think the fishing trip was successful in"
414,00:24:52.00,00:24:52.00,cementing my and J.T.'s friendship.
415,00:24:54.79,00:24:54.79,"And I know that it makes me look like his goofy, awkward,"
416,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,"right-hand man. But if he thinks I'm the goofy,"
417,00:25:01.08,00:25:01.08,"awkward right-hand man, he's going to want to keep me around"
418,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,longer. There's something inside here.
419,00:25:24.08,00:25:24.08,">> When Jalapao tribe picked me to go to Exile, I was totally"
420,00:25:27.12,00:25:27.12,psyched. I wanted the chance to get the
421,00:25:28.46,00:25:28.46,"immunity idol. Rice, awesome."
422,00:25:31.33,00:25:31.33,And also to come to Exile with somebody from the other tribe
423,00:25:34.25,00:25:34.25,is a great opportunity to learn some information.
424,00:25:41.92,00:25:41.92,">> ""You must each choose an urn."""
425,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,>> You go first. >> All right.
426,00:25:47.62,00:25:47.62,"Once Brendan and I made it to Exile Island, we found two"
427,00:25:50.46,00:25:50.46,"urns, and there was a message that we both had to choose one."
428,00:25:56.92,00:25:56.92,There's nothing in mine. >> Uh-oh.
429,00:26:01.12,00:26:01.12,"""Open in private."" >> Oh, crap!"
430,00:26:03.92,00:26:03.92,>> Can you give me a moment? >> Take a second.
431,00:26:06.75,00:26:06.75,"We only have two cups. >> ""Congratulations."
432,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,You now have the clue to hidden immunity idol.
433,00:26:13.29,00:26:13.29,It's up to you whether you share this information with
434,00:26:15.17,00:26:15.17,"anyone else."" I opened up my cup and it had"
435,00:26:20.50,00:26:20.50,two notes in it. The first note was the first
436,00:26:24.00,00:26:24.00,"clue to find the immunity idol. ""If you want to be safe, snoop"
437,00:26:28.04,00:26:28.04,"around, take a peek, but in tribal homelands is the thing"
438,00:26:31.58,00:26:31.58,"that you seek."" The tribal homelands?"
439,00:26:35.33,00:26:35.33,I kind of look at this as an awesome thing to get sent to
440,00:26:37.75,00:26:37.75,Exile this early in the game. I just have to figure out where
441,00:26:40.33,00:26:40.33,"the tribal homelands are. ""Also you have a choice before"
442,00:26:42.83,00:26:42.83,you. At the end of your stay at
443,00:26:44.58,00:26:44.58,"Exile, you can return to the tribe you just left or you"
444,00:26:46.92,00:26:46.92,can join the other tribe. This is a big decision.
445,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,"It has potential to turn this game on its head."""
446,00:26:52.12,00:26:52.12,That it does. The second note was saying that
447,00:26:55.21,00:26:55.21,I had the ability to switch tribes.
448,00:26:57.00,00:26:57.00,"No chance, no chance I'll go to Jalapao."
449,00:27:02.00,00:27:02.00,Let me see it. I just want to see what it looks like.
450,00:27:07.12,00:27:07.12,"...with writing on it. I'm gonna go take a walk,"
451,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,though. >> Do you want me to help you
452,00:27:11.21,00:27:11.21,find it? It's yours.
453,00:27:12.29,00:27:12.29,">> You can walk with me, yeah. >> Yeah, I don't want to sit"
454,00:27:14.21,00:27:14.21,here by myself. I'm working Brendan to give
455,00:27:16.50,00:27:16.50,myself a chance to find the idol.
456,00:27:18.96,00:27:18.96,So I'm like trying to be real nice.
457,00:27:20.75,00:27:20.75,I'm playing up the friendly aspect because when my tribe
458,00:27:23.04,00:27:23.04,found out who my husband actually is-- Eddie George from
459,00:27:26.12,00:27:26.12,"the NFL-- I could just tell that they were thinking,"
460,00:27:28.08,00:27:28.08,"""Well, she doesn't need this. We need it."""
461,00:27:29.12,00:27:29.12,Everybody thinks they have a great cause.
462,00:27:30.42,00:27:30.42,"Hell, my cause is I want it and I'm going to stay here and get"
463,00:27:32.58,00:27:32.58,"it. ""If you want to be safe, snoop"
464,00:27:44.62,00:27:44.62,"around, take a peek, but in the tribal homelands is the thing"
465,00:27:47.88,00:27:47.88,"that you seek."" >> Does that make any sense?"
466,00:27:52.54,00:27:52.54,>> I think our homelands are where we live.
467,00:27:55.25,00:27:55.25,">> Oh, you're right. At that point, when I realized"
468,00:27:58.42,00:27:58.42,"the idol was somewhere back at the tribe camps, I was thinking"
469,00:28:02.21,00:28:02.21,there's two hidden immunity idols.
470,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,"There's one in our camp, and one in Jalapao's camp, and it's"
471,00:28:06.62,00:28:06.62,not the same idol that Sierra was looking for.
472,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,"Do you have, like, a buddy on your team?"
473,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,>> I haven't really bonded with anyone yet.
474,00:28:13.92,00:28:13.92,"So we have to bond. >> Seriously, I'm all for that."
475,00:28:16.92,00:28:16.92,">> We have to bond. >> So when you go back, will you"
476,00:28:19.21,00:28:19.21,tell other people it's in your homeland?
477,00:28:21.17,00:28:21.17,">> Probably not. See, I'm thinking I need to save"
478,00:28:23.96,00:28:23.96,myself from my tribe. >> Yeah.
479,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,"I'm an entrepreneur, and having your own business, you"
480,00:28:28.33,00:28:28.33,have to make people understand who you are and make them feel
481,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,"that, you know what, we can work together."
482,00:28:33.33,00:28:33.33,And Taj and I created a great bond that could be very helpful
483,00:28:36.92,00:28:36.92,for both of us if we do get to the merge.
484,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"So if we do rendezvous later in the game, I think we will have"
485,00:28:41.71,00:28:41.71,a relationship in place. The goal is that we both get to
486,00:28:45.12,00:28:45.12,get sent back here. >> That's perfect.
487,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,">> Hopefully, that will give us the next clue where it is in"
488,00:28:50.08,00:28:50.08,our homeland. So we need to work together.
489,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,>> Yeah. >> Does that work?
490,00:28:53.62,00:28:53.62,>> That works for me. We're going to try it.
491,00:28:55.21,00:28:55.21,">> That works? >> Oh, yeah."
492,00:29:03.12,00:29:03.12,">> You guys, this is really good."
493,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,>> You got a big chunk out of your elbow right there.
494,00:29:07.75,00:29:07.75,">> That's where that young kid tackled me, man."
495,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,>> I am shocked at that little old lady.
496,00:29:11.96,00:29:11.96,">> Yeah, they almost drowned me at one point."
497,00:29:15.33,00:29:15.33,">> It was a very tough challenge, and it got really"
498,00:29:17.42,00:29:17.42,"physical. So when we lost, I was very"
499,00:29:20.12,00:29:20.12,disappointed. I hate to lose because
500,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,"somebody is going home. >> Honestly, I didn't see Coach"
501,00:29:28.29,00:29:28.29,playing that hard. He barely tackled anyone.
502,00:29:31.67,00:29:31.67,"He didn't fight to get free. We need action, not words."
503,00:29:36.00,00:29:36.00,">> I feel like I'm dealing with one of the, like, church women"
504,00:29:38.46,00:29:38.46,"at my church that go every Sunday and wear these hats,"
505,00:29:41.38,00:29:41.38,"but they ain't on the up-and-up. That's what I feel like, you"
506,00:29:44.92,00:29:44.92,know. Coach is not excelling
507,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,physically in the way that I thought he would.
508,00:29:52.54,00:29:52.54,"And at the end of the day, I really don't see, like, what"
509,00:29:56.12,00:29:56.12,all Coach is bringing to the table except a lot of talk.
510,00:30:11.75,00:30:11.75,">> You know what I mean, big-time right now."
511,00:30:14.25,00:30:14.25,I don't know. I just... I don't like to be
512,00:30:16.54,00:30:16.54,"around negativity, and if we've got negative going on in the"
513,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,"group, it's going to be really tough for me."
514,00:30:21.50,00:30:21.50,>> This kind of stuff that you're telling me makes me
515,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,worried because who would go? >> I thought earlier we'd all
516,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,"decided Sierra. >> Yeah, I know, but what I'm"
517,00:30:30.75,00:30:30.75,"thinking is this: I do want the strong people to be here,"
518,00:30:33.88,00:30:33.88,but I mean the poisoned apple needs to go because it's going
519,00:30:36.04,00:30:36.04,to ruin the bunch. At first I thought I'm going
520,00:30:38.96,00:30:38.96,"with the plan and vote for Sierra, and now Candace is..."
521,00:30:41.54,00:30:41.54,"boy, talk about cancer on the team."
522,00:30:44.71,00:30:44.71,"Just the negative attitude, I think everybody's pretty much"
523,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,"fed up with it. And, you know, sometimes there"
524,00:30:49.83,00:30:49.83,is addition by subtraction. She got on me.
525,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,She's going to get on everybody. The cancer will ruin the tribe.
526,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,">> Oh, man, my man! >> Hey!"
527,00:31:13.83,00:31:13.83,">> All right! >> Oh, my God."
528,00:31:16.71,00:31:16.71,">> How you doing, man? >> Good."
529,00:31:18.29,00:31:18.29,">> What's going on, big guy? >> Have you eaten anything?"
530,00:31:20.46,00:31:20.46,">> Yeah, we had rice. We got a fire."
531,00:31:22.12,00:31:22.12,We slept outside. And it's just this giant dune
532,00:31:24.25,00:31:24.25,that comes out of the middle of nowhere.
533,00:31:25.75,00:31:25.75,>> So how did you both look for the idol at the same time?
534,00:31:28.67,00:31:28.67,>> There's two urns... >> Uh-huh.
535,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,">> You each get to pick an urn, and mine was empty and hers"
536,00:31:32.67,00:31:32.67,had a clue. And I was setting up camp.
537,00:31:35.38,00:31:35.38,"She went back up, came back down, but she never really said"
538,00:31:37.96,00:31:37.96,if she got it or not. >> You didn't charm the
539,00:31:39.92,00:31:39.92,clue out of her? >> I don't know; she is clearly
540,00:31:41.88,00:31:41.88,on the outs with her tribe. >> Really?
541,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,">> You think? >> Yeah, that's what she said."
542,00:31:46.04,00:31:46.04,The idol is actually under everybody's nose in camp.
543,00:31:50.00,00:31:50.00,I don't want to let that out of the bag yet.
544,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,"It's one very general clue, and that's too broad."
545,00:31:55.92,00:31:55.92,"So you know, I'll be patient and just hope the clues keep"
546,00:31:58.79,00:31:58.79,falling into my lap. >> Who's that somebody going to
547,00:32:07.46,00:32:07.46,"be? >> Oh, yeah."
548,00:32:13.83,00:32:13.83,"Like, he's a big guy, and he looks like he's in good shape,"
549,00:32:16.38,00:32:16.38,"but I just haven't seen it yet. >> But, I mean, I don't know"
550,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"how soon we can do it. I don't know if this Council,"
551,00:32:22.58,00:32:22.58,it might be too soon. >> Yeah.
552,00:32:25.08,00:32:25.08,>> I think if we just stay chilled and let him keep
553,00:32:27.79,00:32:27.79,digging his hole. >> Yeah.
554,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,>> So then the sad part is somebody has to go.
555,00:32:32.46,00:32:32.46,>> Yeah. >> Everyone has their strengths
556,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,and their weaknesses. We just need to do what makes
557,00:32:40.88,00:32:40.88,the team stronger. >> You're right about that.
558,00:32:44.92,00:32:44.92,">> What do you think, Coach? >> The original plan when we"
559,00:32:55.75,00:32:55.75,walked into camp was to go with Sierra.
560,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,">> Okay, got it. I didn't know how original"
561,00:32:59.46,00:32:59.46,"we were talking. I'm like, wait a minute."
562,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,Is there a new original plan? >> We're going to Tribal
563,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,Council. And the girls think
564,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,"that everybody is voting for Sierra, but for me, the obvious"
565,00:33:09.92,00:33:09.92,choice is Candace. She's just a cancer on the
566,00:33:11.75,00:33:11.75,tribe. I've been looking forward to
567,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,this elimination. I think it's good.
568,00:33:16.29,00:33:16.29,"I think it's what we need. So hopefully, Candace has her"
569,00:33:18.75,00:33:18.75,bags packed because she's out of here.
570,00:33:31.42,00:33:31.42,">> How about you? >> Yeah, that..."
571,00:33:33.54,00:33:33.54,She crossed my mind. Sierra was on my mind at first.
572,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,">> Coach, he wants to get rid of Candace."
573,00:33:42.42,00:33:42.42,"You know, I didn't necessarily think he was right."
574,00:33:44.46,00:33:44.46,"In the challenge yesterday, as hard as Sierra played, I think"
575,00:33:48.71,00:33:48.71,that she's just too small for something like that.
576,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"Every time I saw her, she was trying her hardest, but"
577,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33,somebody was holding her down. So I think there's going to be
578,00:33:58.12,00:33:58.12,some challenges that probably would suit Candace better than
579,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,"they would Sierra. We need to keep the strongest,"
580,00:34:03.54,00:34:03.54,happiest tribe we can. >> Yeah.
581,00:34:11.62,00:34:11.62,>> I will not vote you off tonight.
582,00:34:14.08,00:34:14.08,">> I feel like it's my time, it's my time."
583,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,>> I'm going to tell you something.
584,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,I make my living off of people trusting me.
585,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33,So you just have to be cool and relax.
586,00:34:27.54,00:34:27.54,">> Coach told me I wasn't going to get voted out, but I know"
587,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"that my whole tribe, from the beginning, wanted to vote me"
588,00:34:34.96,00:34:34.96,"off, so I'm freaking out a little bit about that."
589,00:34:37.58,00:34:37.58,>> Stop worrying. >> I'm not worrying.
590,00:34:39.71,00:34:39.71,>> You are worrying. You can't say you're not
591,00:34:41.25,00:34:41.25,worrying. I know you're worrying.
592,00:34:44.00,00:34:44.00,>> I am not comfortable at all. I still have not found the
593,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,"hidden immunity idol. So, I'm still looking behind my"
594,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,back. >> That's a long time for
595,00:34:58.08,00:34:58.08,people to be rallying. >> Mm-hmm.
596,00:35:03.29,00:35:03.29,">> I don't know. >> Okay, let's think about this."
597,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,You and I are both strong. >> Yeah.
598,00:35:09.21,00:35:09.21,>> The guys have been talking about voting Sierra off for
599,00:35:11.58,00:35:11.58,"days. >> Okay, I worry about the fact"
600,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,"that, like, if anybody strays a little bit, like..."
601,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,">> Listen, I'm going to tell you right now."
602,00:35:19.33,00:35:19.33,It ain't you or me. They know what we're worth.
603,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,"As far as I know, it's Sierra going home."
604,00:35:26.75,00:35:26.75,"And if it's not, then there's mad shadiness going on around"
605,00:35:31.12,00:35:31.12,this tribe. >> Yeah.
606,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,>> Everybody trying to figure it out.
607,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,>> And this is just the beginning.
608,00:35:42.04,00:35:42.04,>> I know it. >> PROBST: Behind each of you
609,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch.
610,00:36:06.75,00:36:06.75,"Approach the flame, dip it in, and get fire."
611,00:36:12.33,00:36:12.33,"This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because, in this"
612,00:36:14.92,00:36:14.92,"game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire,"
613,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,"you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are"
614,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,you. Let's go back to the very
615,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"beginning. Sierra, based on very little"
616,00:36:26.96,00:36:26.96,"information, you were voted out of this tribe."
617,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,What was going through your mind at that moment?
618,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,">> Um, a part of me wanted to give up for a second."
619,00:36:35.04,00:36:35.04,"It was written all over my face that I was sick, so I"
620,00:36:38.38,00:36:38.38,automatically looked weak from the get-go.
621,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"So I think their vote was valid. >> PROBST: Tyson, what was your"
622,00:36:43.75,00:36:43.75,reaction to Sierra? >> She kind of looked miserable
623,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,on the truck. I didn't see her pull
624,00:36:48.08,00:36:48.08,anything off. I didn't see her gather very
625,00:36:49.88,00:36:49.88,much. She seemed to be struggling in
626,00:36:51.21,00:36:51.21,"the heat and didn't seem very happy, so..."
627,00:36:55.12,00:36:55.12,">> PROBST: Candace, how much time was spent talking about"
628,00:36:57.12,00:36:57.12,Sierra and why everybody voted for her?
629,00:36:59.54,00:36:59.54,">> Honestly, there was a little bit of resentment because it was"
630,00:37:02.00,00:37:02.00,such a difficult trek and she was taking a helicopter ride.
631,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,And I think she really wasn't that excited to be here or
632,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,wanted to be here as much as everyone else.
633,00:37:12.12,00:37:12.12,">> PROBST: And what do you think the vibe is on you,"
634,00:37:13.92,00:37:13.92,overall? >> I think I'm vibing with the
635,00:37:16.54,00:37:16.54,"group, but it's like, you never know."
636,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"I mean, sometimes I talk a lot, and maybe that might be"
637,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,misinterpreted. We're all different.
638,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"It's hard to tell. >> PROBST: Coach, do you think"
639,00:37:26.08,00:37:26.08,anybody would tell you this early in the game if you didn't
640,00:37:28.46,00:37:28.46,"mesh? >> At this point, you got to"
641,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,go with your intuition. And if you're clashing with
642,00:37:33.08,00:37:33.08,"somebody, you've got to sense that on your own because I guess"
643,00:37:36.12,00:37:36.12,"at this stage, nobody is going to tell you that."
644,00:37:38.79,00:37:38.79,>> PROBST: Let's talk a little about Exile Island.
645,00:37:40.83,00:37:40.83,"Brendan, how was Exile? >> Um, it wasn't exactly"
646,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"luxurious by any means, but it was a cool experience to go"
647,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,check out and have a chance to kind of go there with Taj and go
648,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,"through the process of Exile. >> PROBST: So, Coach, how"
649,00:37:53.96,00:37:53.96,curious was everybody about Brendan's stay on Exile?
650,00:37:56.92,00:37:56.92,">> Right off the bat, he said there were two jars, and one of"
651,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,them had a clue to look for the idol and the other one didn't.
652,00:38:01.67,00:38:01.67,He didn't get the clue. And that's somebody that I
653,00:38:04.88,00:38:04.88,respect and trust and I believe 100% when he tells me something.
654,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,">> PROBST: Jerry, are you surprised how quickly trust is"
655,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,a major issue in this game? You barely know these people.
656,00:38:15.75,00:38:15.75,">> Jeff, yes, trust is a major issue in this game."
657,00:38:19.88,00:38:19.88,"Because if you can win the trust of over half the tribe, then"
658,00:38:22.29,00:38:22.29,"you'll be here for a while. But if you can't win the trust,"
659,00:38:24.75,00:38:24.75,your time here is going to be limited.
660,00:38:26.88,00:38:26.88,>> PROBST: Hard to make a vote this early on?
661,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,>> It's really hard to make a vote this early on.
662,00:38:30.58,00:38:30.58,"I've bonded with this group of individuals so closely, and"
663,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50,"we've got to know each other real, I mean, real well."
664,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,">> PROBST: Erinn, what are you reacting to?"
665,00:38:38.71,00:38:38.71,>> We can talk all day about how much we all get along and
666,00:38:42.50,00:38:42.50,"this, that and the other thing, but we don't know these people."
667,00:38:44.62,00:38:44.62,We've known them for six days. But I don't know if the person
668,00:38:47.75,00:38:47.75,I've bonded with is who you really are.
669,00:38:49.46,00:38:49.46,I just think we need to be careful.
670,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,>> I have to disagree with Erinn.
671,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,We're not at the Holiday Inn. We are out there surviving
672,00:38:56.12,00:38:56.12,"together. That trek that we went through,"
673,00:38:58.67,00:38:58.67,to me that's how you really get to know someone.
674,00:39:00.88,00:39:00.88,>> But I don't know that that's how you get to trust someone.
675,00:39:03.25,00:39:03.25,">> Well, I've already built trust."
676,00:39:05.12,00:39:05.12,I've built trust with several people on this tribe.
677,00:39:09.21,00:39:09.21,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
678,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,"Tyson, you're up. >> You played a great physical"
679,00:39:39.12,00:39:39.12,"game, but nobody wants a snake in the grass."
680,00:40:13.25,00:40:13.25,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
681,00:40:28.33,00:40:28.33,>> PROBST: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you
682,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"want to play it, now would be the time to do so."
683,00:40:36.12,00:40:36.12,"All right. Once the votes are read,"
684,00:40:38.25,00:40:38.25,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
685,00:40:40.04,00:40:40.04,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
686,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,I'll read the votes. First vote: Candace.
687,00:40:52.62,00:40:52.62,Sierra. One vote Candace;
688,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,one vote Sierra. Candace.
689,00:41:00.12,00:41:00.12,Two votes Candace; one vote Sierra.
690,00:41:05.17,00:41:05.17,Candace. That's three votes Candace;
691,00:41:07.92,00:41:07.92,one vote Sierra. Candace.
692,00:41:14.08,00:41:14.08,Four votes Candace; one vote Sierra.
693,00:41:21.04,00:41:21.04,Second person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins: Candace.
694,00:41:24.29,00:41:24.29,That's five. That's enough.
695,00:41:25.67,00:41:25.67,"You need to bring me your torch. Candace, the tribe has spoken."
696,00:41:52.12,00:41:52.12,"Well, your first Tribal Council, your first blindside."
697,00:41:55.42,00:41:55.42,Congratulations. Grab your torches.
698,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,Head back to camp. Good night.

704,00:42:19.00,00:42:19.00,The tribes are hit hard. >> Push it!

707,00:42:25.92,00:42:25.92,>> We would have a four-way alliance that nobody knows

709,00:42:30.21,00:42:30.21,>> Exactly. >> They won't even know what's
710,00:42:32.04,00:42:32.04,coming. (laughing)
711,00:42:41.50,00:42:41.50,>> I'm surprised. I'm really pissed off.
712,00:42:44.79,00:42:44.79,I worked really hard. I worked in the challenges.
713,00:42:48.12,00:42:48.12,I worked on camp. And I did everything I could
714,00:42:51.08,00:42:51.08,to try to make Timbira stronger. And I thought that that was the
715,00:42:54.12,00:42:54.12,goal. But I guess this is more like
716,00:42:56.46,00:42:56.46,"day camp. In the long run, I was an asset"
717,00:42:58.92,00:42:58.92,and they're going to need me.
