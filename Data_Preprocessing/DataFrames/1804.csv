289,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,else could we convince themthat they should take?

309,00:18:16.71,00:18:16.71,We hear you're boiling water.>> We might as well just take
310,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,a sack of beans and somethingelse.
311,00:18:20.08,00:18:20.08,>> That's what I'm thinking.Take that sack; leave this.

314,00:18:26.62,00:18:26.62,I think it's a very smart ideanot to take both sacks of beans
315,00:18:29.88,00:18:29.88,because you have to look forwardin this game.
316,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,There could be a switch at anytime.
317,00:18:34.12,00:18:34.12,And if I was to end up overthere on the Timbira Tribe with
318,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,"no beans 'cause I just stoleboth sacks, I'd be pissed."

326,00:19:06.50,00:19:06.50,">> All right, so the real deal,though, is they had two bags of"

335,00:19:23.46,00:19:23.46,We didn't take nothing fromthem.
336,00:19:24.79,00:19:24.79,"They still got beans, and theystill got water containers."
337,00:19:26.67,00:19:26.67,"But, you know, there was nothingelse to take."

562,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,"go back to six on six.So it was just, overall, very"
563,00:32:09.71,00:32:09.71,"frustrating.>> We see all these words, but"
564,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,it's just like there is no rhymeor reason.
565,00:32:27.92,00:32:27.92,"God, it was just so random.>> I think it's the curse of"
566,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,the beans.>> I was not surprised that we
567,00:32:37.92,00:32:37.92,"lost because we went on afour-challenge winning streak,"
568,00:32:41.38,00:32:41.38,so I definitely thought that itwas coming.
569,00:32:43.58,00:32:43.58,I just need to cool off.I'm so dehydrated.
570,00:32:46.25,00:32:46.25,Sierra and I found the lastclue for the idol.
571,00:32:48.67,00:32:48.67,I know exactly where it is.I'll talk to Stephen as soon as
572,00:32:51.42,00:32:51.42,"I get a second, but right now,we need to focus on Tribal"
573,00:32:54.25,00:32:54.25,"Council.>> I mean, honestly, I'm kind"
574,00:33:03.83,00:33:03.83,"of glad, though.Not someone, but..."
575,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,"Someone... her names rhymeswith ""Andy."""
576,00:33:14.46,00:33:14.46,"(Sydney laughs)>> Oh, Lord."
577,00:33:17.50,00:33:17.50,"So what are we going to dotonight, y'all?"
578,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,">> What do y'all think?>> Oh, God..."
579,00:33:22.83,00:33:22.83,>> I don't know.I know I don't want to go home.
580,00:33:25.42,00:33:25.42,>> I don't want to go home.>> I'd also like not to go home.
581,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,">> Honestly, I'm going to putthis out there."
582,00:33:30.42,00:33:30.42,I think Sandy was stronger thanSydney in the last two
583,00:33:33.04,00:33:33.04,"competitions, honestly.>> The problem if we eliminate"
584,00:33:36.00,00:33:36.00,"Sydney, Spencer and Joe bothare going to be..."
585,00:33:38.79,00:33:38.79,">> They're going to turn on us.>> Has she been really, like,"
586,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"the catalyst in the challenges?>> You know, she's strong."
587,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,"She's not that strong inchallenges, you're right."
588,00:33:49.17,00:33:49.17,"I mean, she's, you know, a nicepresence around camp."
589,00:33:53.12,00:33:53.12,She works hard.She works hard around camp.
590,00:33:57.79,00:33:57.79,">> Yeah, yeah, we do.>> I've got mixed emotions."
591,00:34:02.29,00:34:02.29,"I don't feel bad and I don'tfeel good, you know?"
592,00:34:05.29,00:34:05.29,"Taj is leaning towards Sydney,and she said I'm doing better"
593,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"in the challenges, actually,than Sydney, but we'll see."
594,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,I think maybe J.T. and them aretelling me the truth and I'm
595,00:34:14.42,00:34:14.42,going to be here tomorrow.>> It's up to y'all.
596,00:34:17.88,00:34:17.88,Just let me and know I'll dowhatever y'all want me to do.
597,00:34:20.62,00:34:20.62,>> I will.The important thing is now is
598,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17,figuring out am I going to sendSandy home or am I going to
599,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,send Sydney home?I have a big dilemma right now.
600,00:34:28.38,00:34:28.38,I'm not sure what I want to do.>> I was excited to meet other
601,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,people who I would never get achance to meet.
602,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,"And also just to see how Iwould like, fare."
603,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,">> I like the sneakiness of it,too, 'cause I'm not very sneaky"
604,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,"back home, you know?So you get to be sneaky in a"
605,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,"new environment.>> Oh, really?"
606,00:35:09.62,00:35:09.62,>> So you're being sneaky?That's interesting.
607,00:35:11.08,00:35:11.08,">> Yeah, I'm glad you told methat."
608,00:35:13.42,00:35:13.42,">> That's good information.>> All of y'all are sneaky, too,"
609,00:35:15.96,00:35:15.96,so don't even start with me.>> Sydney's good looks make a
610,00:35:20.58,00:35:20.58,"positive first impression, butthat could be, you know, part"
611,00:35:25.08,00:35:25.08,"of her devious personality.If there's a merge coming up,"
612,00:35:28.25,00:35:28.25,"we need strong members, but wealso need loyal members, so"
613,00:35:31.29,00:35:31.29,getting rid of Sydney couldmake a lot of sense.
614,00:35:39.79,00:35:39.79,">> As far I know, the vote'sgoing to be going on to Sandy K."
615,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,tonight.I feel like I've tried to get
616,00:35:48.17,00:35:48.17,"on the good sides of people,so, hopefully, it's not me."
617,00:35:51.92,00:35:51.92,"But then again, it's Survivor.So, you know, everyone wants to"
618,00:35:54.58,00:35:54.58,win.So we'll see.
619,00:36:17.58,00:36:17.58,">> PROBST: Sandy, going back today one, you were out of this"
620,00:36:20.29,00:36:20.29,"game.Here we are on day 12, you're"
621,00:36:22.62,00:36:22.62,still sitting pretty.Have you recovered from that
622,00:36:25.04,00:36:25.04,first impression?>> I believe I did recover.
623,00:36:28.12,00:36:28.12,"I fit in with this gang quitewell, given the fact that, uh,"
624,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,"you know, I'm the older woman.So, yeah, it makes me feel good."
625,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,"Believe me.>> PROBST: J.T., how did Sandy"
626,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,recover from such an awfulstart?
627,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,">> Well, Sandy's kind of themother of the crowd."
628,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,She takes care of us and freesus up to do the hard work.
629,00:36:45.79,00:36:45.79,">> PROBST: Sandy, do you spendany time at all reflecting on"
630,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,your age when you're spendingso much time with people that
631,00:36:51.96,00:36:51.96,"are considerably younger andrelatively speaking,"
632,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,"a good-looking group of people?>> Yes, the old age factor"
633,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,"plays a part in that, but, youknow, I bring them a lot of"
634,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,laughs and so forth.But I think people might use
635,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,"their, maybe, a little bit oftheir beauty or their body, you"
636,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,know?I've seen a little bit of
637,00:37:10.08,00:37:10.08,"flirting going on as far asSydney is concerned, you know?"
638,00:37:12.42,00:37:12.42,"Maybe wearing the boxer shortsof J.T., you know."
639,00:37:16.54,00:37:16.54,">> PROBST: J.T., is she wearingyour boxers?"
640,00:37:18.75,00:37:18.75,">> Yeah, Jeff, she's wearing myboxers."
641,00:37:22.62,00:37:22.62,>> It's hot out there.I don't have shorts.
642,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,I'm wearing jeans.>> PROBST: Nobody asked you to
643,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,"defend.>> I know, that's all I'm"
644,00:37:29.50,00:37:29.50,"saying though.>> PROBST: Joe, do you see that"
645,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,going on?>> Yeah.
646,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,"Yeah, I see flirting going on.>> PROBST: Stephen, fair part"
647,00:37:38.21,00:37:38.21,"of the game?If you're a young, beautiful"
648,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,"woman, why not try to use itto influence the guys?"
649,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,">> First of all, I should saythat the big flirting"
650,00:37:44.46,00:37:44.46,"relationship has not beenmentioned yet, which is between"
651,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,Sydney and Joe.They flirt maybe a little more
652,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"than J.T. and Sydney flirt.>> PROBST: Sydney, you were"
653,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,"nodding your head and smiling.>> Yeah, I mean, I have a"
654,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,flirtatious personality.I flirt with women.
655,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,I definitely flirt with Joe.He's a great guy.
656,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,I get along with him reallywell.
657,00:38:02.08,00:38:02.08,"It's just inevitable for me,I think."
658,00:38:04.21,00:38:04.21,">> PROBST: Taj, how's that sitwith you?"
659,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,">> First of all, let's just saySydney is gorgeous."
660,00:38:08.54,00:38:08.54,"So men are definitely going tobe attracted to her,"
661,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,regardless.They can't help themselves.
662,00:38:12.67,00:38:12.67,"So if there's an alliance, itwould be with her and not me"
663,00:38:15.58,00:38:15.58,because she probably what theywant to align with anyway.
664,00:38:18.29,00:38:18.29,And that's okay because I'llmake my way through the game
665,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,regardless.>> PROBST: Hold on.
666,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"""That's okay""?>> It's okay with me, oh, yeah."
667,00:38:24.54,00:38:24.54,>> PROBST: I don't buy that fora second.
668,00:38:26.58,00:38:26.58,>> I have to accept the factthat they are attracted to her.
669,00:38:29.21,00:38:29.21,They're not attracted to me.That's okay with me.
670,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,I'll be all right with orwithout their attraction.
671,00:38:34.21,00:38:34.21,">> PROBST: Sydney, does thishappen to you a lot?"
672,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,Conversations end up revolvingaround your looks?
673,00:38:38.96,00:38:38.96,">> Yeah, it happens a lot.My profession is a model, you"
674,00:38:41.38,00:38:41.38,know?So people stereotype me as the
675,00:38:43.92,00:38:43.92,blonde girl who doesn't have alot to stay and sits there and
676,00:38:46.50,00:38:46.50,"be pretty.But, that doesn't mean, like..."
677,00:38:50.21,00:38:50.21,I don't know.It's hard to explain.
678,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,">> PROBST: Stephen, could thatwork against Sydney?"
679,00:38:54.83,00:38:54.83,">> Definitely.I mean, someone could think,"
680,00:38:57.21,00:38:57.21,"""Oh, she's just a flirt; she'snothing,"" and just undervalue"
681,00:38:59.92,00:38:59.92,"her throughout the game.>> PROBST: Sandy, how will this"
682,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,tribe be different tomorrow?>> I think there might be a
683,00:39:07.12,00:39:07.12,"person or two upset, dependingon the outcome."
684,00:39:10.71,00:39:10.71,I imagine there'll be a coupleof real upsets.
685,00:39:13.29,00:39:13.29,"So tomorrow will tell the story.>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
686,00:39:18.25,00:39:18.25,"vote.Joe, you're up."
