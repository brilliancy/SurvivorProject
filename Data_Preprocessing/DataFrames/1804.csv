2,00:00:02.33,00:00:02.33,Survivor: This game is on.
3,00:00:04.08,00:00:04.08,Timbira had the early advantage when they outmaneuvered Jalapao
4,00:00:09.29,00:00:09.29,"in the game's opening moments. >> We got all the water, we got"
5,00:00:12.17,00:00:12.17,"all the beans, everything we needed."
6,00:00:14.96,00:00:14.96,>> PROBST: And Timbira continued to dominate when they
7,00:00:17.42,00:00:17.42,won the first immunity challenge.
8,00:00:19.38,00:00:19.38,"Carolina, the tribe has spoken. At Exile Island, Taj and"
9,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67,Brendan formed a secret cross-tribal alliance...
10,00:00:26.08,00:00:26.08,(Taj laughs) ...with plans to include Taj's
11,00:00:31.75,00:00:31.75,Jalapao tribe mate Stephen and Brendan's Timbira tribe mate
12,00:00:35.54,00:00:35.54,Sierra. (thunder rumbles)
13,00:00:38.04,00:00:38.04,(cheering) Jalapao won the next immunity
14,00:00:40.71,00:00:40.71,"challenge, sending Timbira to Tribal Council."
15,00:00:44.17,00:00:44.17,"Candace, the tribe has spoken. Jalapao wins immunity!"
16,00:00:48.12,00:00:48.12,Jalapao then went on to gain a clear advantage.
17,00:00:51.25,00:00:51.25,"Timbira, another tribe member going home."
18,00:00:56.17,00:00:56.17,Timbira tried to solve their problems by choosing a leader.
19,00:00:59.71,00:00:59.71,">> I think it should be Brendan. >> PROBST: Which angered Coach,"
20,00:01:03.58,00:01:03.58,who thought he was in charge. >> I love to be the leader.
21,00:01:06.33,00:01:06.33,That's what I'm used to doing. >> PROBST: Erinn disagreed.
22,00:01:09.08,00:01:09.08,">> I think it's a role that Coach is used to, but it's"
23,00:01:11.46,00:01:11.46,something that Brendan does better.
24,00:01:14.38,00:01:14.38,>> PROBST: Erinn. Erinn's conflict with Coach
25,00:01:16.96,00:01:16.96,almost got her voted out. Third person voted out of
26,00:01:19.71,00:01:19.71,Survivor: Tocantins: Jerry. But Jerry was sent home for
27,00:01:23.83,00:01:23.83,being weakened by his illness... The tribe has spoken.
28,00:01:28.25,00:01:28.25,...putting Timbira at six members to Jalapao's seven.
29,00:01:32.54,00:01:32.54,Can Timbira put aside their differences to make a comeback?
30,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
31,00:01:54.62,00:01:54.62,"(Debbie sighs) >> Uh, so at Tribal Council"
32,00:02:03.08,00:02:03.08,"tonight, Erinn and I got into an argument about the leadership"
33,00:02:06.25,00:02:06.25,on the tribe. And she said Brendan is a
34,00:02:09.04,00:02:09.04,better leader. But she doesn't know what she's
35,00:02:11.04,00:02:11.04,"talking about. It pissed me off, and it made me"
36,00:02:14.75,00:02:14.75,think Erinn's got to go because she is the cancer of the tribe.
37,00:02:19.25,00:02:19.25,"She would have been voted out tonight, almost unanimously,"
38,00:02:23.62,00:02:23.62,had it not been for Jerry coming down sick.
39,00:02:34.21,00:02:34.21,">> You guys, you want to do a powwow?"
40,00:02:38.25,00:02:38.25,">> I thought it was actually great last night that, like,"
41,00:02:40.17,00:02:40.17,"Jeff brought it up. >> I mean, we could have a"
42,00:02:42.92,00:02:42.92,general leader. >> If we all decide that Coach
43,00:02:46.04,00:02:46.04,"wants to do it or Tyson wants to do it, I'm totally on board."
44,00:02:49.75,00:02:49.75,"So I think we just kind of all, just as a group, kind"
45,00:02:52.38,00:02:52.38,"of decide what we think works best, and then just make that"
46,00:02:56.08,00:02:56.08,decision and be done with it. >> Right.
47,00:02:57.62,00:02:57.62,>> We need it. It's crazy.
48,00:02:59.08,00:02:59.08,"It's crazy not to have it. >> Last night at Tribal, we"
49,00:03:01.96,00:03:01.96,"established a leader, kind of. So I guess Brendan or Coach is"
50,00:03:06.25,00:03:06.25,the leader. I don't know.
51,00:03:07.88,00:03:07.88,"It's, uh... I wasn't paying attention."
52,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,I don't really care. >> I think that... as much as I
53,00:03:16.92,00:03:16.92,"like leading, and, you know, if you were voted off tomorrow,"
54,00:03:22.58,00:03:22.58,"yeah, I'd gladly step into that role."
55,00:03:24.17,00:03:24.17,"But I think that, at the moment, everybody, including"
56,00:03:27.25,00:03:27.25,"myself, trusts you as being the leader."
57,00:03:29.33,00:03:29.33,"And as much as I would enjoy that role, we just have that one"
58,00:03:32.79,00:03:32.79,person. >> Yeah.
59,00:03:33.96,00:03:33.96,>> It's more productive. >> Yeah.
60,00:03:36.67,00:03:36.67,">> You know, if Brendan got voted off and I was the leader,"
61,00:03:39.71,00:03:39.71,I think this tribe would be better.
62,00:03:41.33,00:03:41.33,But I don't want to vote Brendan off because that's my
63,00:03:43.38,00:03:43.38,M.O. I want iron that sharpens iron.
64,00:03:45.46,00:03:45.46,>> And I didn't mean to sound last night like I was saying I
65,00:03:49.17,00:03:49.17,don't think that you would be a good leader.
66,00:03:51.21,00:03:51.21,I think you would be a great leader.
67,00:03:53.88,00:03:53.88,>> There's only one experienced person out here as far as being
68,00:03:56.38,00:03:56.38,"out in the outdoors, and that would be me."
69,00:03:59.08,00:03:59.08,These people here are new kids on the block.
70,00:04:00.96,00:04:00.96,"What they've been doing is not succeeding, not thriving,"
71,00:04:05.25,00:04:05.25,"but existing. If you look at me, you look at"
72,00:04:07.88,00:04:07.88,"Brendan, who looks stronger? I do."
73,00:04:11.21,00:04:11.21,We need to thrive in the wild and not just exist.
74,00:04:15.04,00:04:15.04,"And I think the difference is is that I've been here, and they"
75,00:04:17.88,00:04:17.88,haven't.  Captioning sponsored by

79,00:05:53.12,00:05:53.12,think we're all concerned with how she's holding up.
80,00:05:55.25,00:05:55.25,It's definitely worn her down to be out there and to be out
81,00:05:58.21,00:05:58.21,"in the elements with no food, no water, nobody to trust."
82,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,So we're all concerned with the toll this is going to take
83,00:06:03.21,00:06:03.21,on her in the long run. >> I am.
84,00:06:09.46,00:06:09.46,>> Brendan and I have our secret Exile alliance.
85,00:06:12.12,00:06:12.12,So now I need to talk to Stephen because I know I can
86,00:06:15.00,00:06:15.00,"trust him. He's kind of like the nerdy,"
87,00:06:16.83,00:06:16.83,"shy guy who just wants to help everybody, and I know that I can"
88,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,depend on him in the long run. >> How you feeling?
89,00:06:24.21,00:06:24.21,>> This hammock feels lovely. >> Yeah?
90,00:06:26.29,00:06:26.29,>> Yeah. >> You look quite relaxed in
91,00:06:27.75,00:06:27.75,there. >> Thank you.
92,00:06:28.42,00:06:28.42,"When you get a second, I want to talk to you by yourself,"
93,00:06:30.67,00:06:30.67,"okay? >> Yeah, absolutely."
94,00:06:40.04,00:06:40.04,"(hooting) >> All right, this is the deal."
95,00:06:42.58,00:06:42.58,"This is going to change your life, okay?"
96,00:06:44.21,00:06:44.21,Do you want to be a part of the biggest upset on Survivor
97,00:06:47.08,00:06:47.08,"history? >> Yes, I do."
98,00:06:47.92,00:06:47.92,>> Okay. He's in an alliance with
99,00:06:52.71,00:06:52.71,"Sierra, and I told him about you."
100,00:06:55.58,00:06:55.58,So the next... >> Taj apparently is aligned
101,00:06:58.00,00:06:58.00,with Brendan and Sierra in the other tribe.
102,00:07:00.54,00:07:00.54,They made a pact on Exile Island to stick with each
103,00:07:03.79,00:07:03.79,"other, stay in the game as long as we can, and look out for each"
104,00:07:06.04,00:07:06.04,other once we get to the merge. So I might have just stumbled
105,00:07:08.79,00:07:08.79,ass-backwards into a huge alliance.
106,00:07:11.46,00:07:11.46,">> So the next time we go to a challenge, if we win, we choose"
107,00:07:15.92,00:07:15.92,Sierra. >> Okay.
108,00:07:17.00,00:07:17.00,>> Sierra's going to choose you. >> You're selling me Exile
109,00:07:19.00,00:07:19.00,"Island, isn't that tough? >> It's not bad at all."
110,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,(laughter) I'm telling you...
111,00:07:24.21,00:07:24.21,I will protect you. I will make sure you're fine.
112,00:07:26.67,00:07:26.67,I just need you to roll with us. >> We got tree mail.
113,00:07:36.04,00:07:36.04,"It's a sandbag. >> Oh, gosh!"
114,00:07:39.08,00:07:39.08,">> ""As time ticks away, supplies start to dwindle."
115,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,Your spirits may begin to corrode.
116,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,"For a boost in morale and improvements at camp, you must"
117,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,"know who can shoulder the load."" (Coach laughs)"
118,00:07:50.21,00:07:50.21,>> That means someone's going to Exile for two days.
119,00:07:52.12,00:07:52.12,>> I just want to win the reward.
120,00:07:53.54,00:07:53.54,>> Yeah. >> Who do you want us to pick
121,00:07:55.04,00:07:55.04,if we win? You want us to go with Taj
122,00:07:57.33,00:07:57.33,again? >> I think we go Taj.
123,00:07:59.12,00:07:59.12,>> And then she's going to get to say you.
124,00:08:01.17,00:08:01.17,">> When Taj and I were on Exile, we set up the Exile"
125,00:08:04.29,00:08:04.29,"alliance-- me with Sierra, and Taj with Stephen."
126,00:08:07.79,00:08:07.79,But I didn't communicate that I had the alliance yet because I
127,00:08:10.92,00:08:10.92,hadn't had a chance to talk to Sierra yet.
128,00:08:13.04,00:08:13.04,"So she doesn't know about the plan, and it could be a pretty"
129,00:08:17.04,00:08:17.04,"heinous situation. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
130,00:08:34.42,00:08:34.42,Jalapao getting your first look at the new Timbira tribe.
131,00:08:38.12,00:08:38.12,Jerry voted out at the last Tribal Council.
132,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
133,00:08:44.08,00:08:44.08,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: For today's
134,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,"challenge, three members of each tribe will have a pole"
135,00:08:48.71,00:08:48.71,"across their shoulders. Each round, weight will be"
136,00:08:51.88,00:08:51.88,added to that pole. The decision about which tribe
137,00:08:55.21,00:08:55.21,member gets the weight will be made by two members of the
138,00:08:58.29,00:08:58.29,other tribe. When the weight becomes too
139,00:09:00.96,00:09:00.96,"much, you'll drop your pole, you're out of the challenge."
140,00:09:03.96,00:09:03.96,Last person left standing wins reward for their tribe.
141,00:09:08.83,00:09:08.83,Only rule in this challenge: you must put two men and one
142,00:09:12.21,00:09:12.21,woman as your weight bearers-- those holding the pole.
143,00:09:16.12,00:09:16.12,Want to know what you're playing for?
144,00:09:17.38,00:09:17.38,">> Yeah! >> PROBST: Today, the reward is"
145,00:09:19.29,00:09:19.29,a camp raid. The winning tribe will send two
146,00:09:22.54,00:09:22.54,"members over to the camp of the losing tribe, where you will be"
147,00:09:25.67,00:09:25.67,"allowed to steal two items. >> Oh, my God."

150,00:09:33.92,00:09:33.92,That person will in turn select somebody from the winning tribe
151,00:09:37.08,00:09:37.08,to join them. Worth playing for?
152,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Because today's
153,00:09:40.67,00:09:40.67,"challenge only requires five people, each tribe will sit"
154,00:09:44.42,00:09:44.42,"people out. Timbira, you have one extra"
155,00:09:46.46,00:09:46.46,member. Who you going to sit out?

170,00:10:30.00,00:10:30.00,actually gets it. Here we go.
171,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,"Three, two, one. Put the weight on."
172,00:10:36.92,00:10:36.92,"Each bag weighs ten pounds. So each round, you are adding"
173,00:10:41.46,00:10:41.46,20 pounds. Next round.
174,00:10:45.04,00:10:45.04,"Timbira, who you want on? >> J.T."

185,00:11:12.50,00:11:12.50,with her first 20 pounds. This is about endurance and
186,00:11:15.62,00:11:15.62,strategy. How long can you stand the
187,00:11:18.08,00:11:18.08,weight? Who do you give it to?
188,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Brendan now at 180 pounds.

219,00:13:12.00,00:13:12.00,>> Strongest man alive! >> PROBST: Tyson drops out at

231,00:13:58.08,00:13:58.08,this challenge has flipped on its head.
232,00:14:00.21,00:14:00.21,Jalapao had a huge lead and is now down to Taj for Jalapao...
233,00:14:03.42,00:14:03.42,">> It's all you, girl. >> PROBST: ...Debra for Timbira."
234,00:14:06.54,00:14:06.54,Both women at 80 pounds. Let's put on some more weight.
235,00:14:10.08,00:14:10.08,No choices to be made. You know who's getting it.

245,00:14:46.75,00:14:46.75,">> Come on, Tajie. >> Stay firm, T."
246,00:14:50.33,00:14:50.33,>> It's sliding. It's sliding. >> Yeah!

250,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,You did a hell of a job. You did a hell of a job.
251,00:15:08.83,00:15:08.83,">> Thank you. >> Hey, that's all hard, baby."
252,00:15:14.12,00:15:14.12,Good job. >> PROBST: Jalapao with your
253,00:15:16.12,00:15:16.12,fourth straight win in a row. >> Yeah.
254,00:15:19.25,00:15:19.25,>> PROBST: Nice job. Decision: who from Timbira
255,00:15:22.54,00:15:22.54,are you going to send to Exile Island?
256,00:15:25.08,00:15:25.08,>> Let's send Sierra. Let's see how she likes it.
257,00:15:27.29,00:15:27.29,">> Good 'cause I'm taking you. >> Oh, you witch!"
258,00:15:30.50,00:15:30.50,>> PROBST: Sierra's picking Taj. All right.
259,00:15:32.58,00:15:32.58,>> That's all right. I'm used to it now.
260,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,">> Today, I didn't have a chance to speak with Sierra before the"
261,00:15:38.12,00:15:38.12,"challenge, so I'm glad she just picked Taj, which was good."
262,00:15:40.83,00:15:40.83,I hope Taj will be able to explain enough about the
263,00:15:43.29,00:15:43.29,situation to hopefully work things out.
264,00:15:47.71,00:15:47.71,">> We love you, Taj. >> PROBST: Both Sierra and Taj"
265,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,will be back in time for the next immunity challenge.
266,00:15:54.42,00:15:54.42,"Timbira, nothing for you. Head back to camp."
267,00:15:57.21,00:15:57.21,Two members from Jalapao will be showing up to do a little
268,00:16:00.17,00:16:00.17,"shopping. >> Good job, you guys."
269,00:16:02.54,00:16:02.54,>> Good job. >> Good job.
270,00:16:03.75,00:16:03.75,>> You did awesome. >> Nice.
271,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,>> Nice. >> Good job.
272,00:16:07.21,00:16:07.21,">> PROBST: Jalapao on your way back, choose two members to"
273,00:16:09.21,00:16:09.21,raid Timbira. Grab your stuff.
274,00:16:11.67,00:16:11.67,"Head out. >> Good job, baby."
275,00:16:15.12,00:16:15.12,>> My biggest concern when we lost the challenge today is
276,00:16:17.67,00:16:17.67,"they're going to clean out our food supply, and then we're"
277,00:16:20.71,00:16:20.71,going to go downhill. We're going to be nothing as
278,00:16:22.79,00:16:22.79,"a tribe in another three, four days with these people only"
279,00:16:25.33,00:16:25.33,eating rice. >> You guys did a great job
280,00:16:41.71,00:16:41.71,"today. >> Yeah, you guys did so good."
281,00:16:46.96,00:16:46.96,">> Yeah, totally. >> Do you think they're going"
282,00:16:48.67,00:16:48.67,to take both bean bags or just one and one rice?
283,00:16:51.50,00:16:51.50,">> But if they can take two things, we really don't have"
284,00:16:53.88,00:16:53.88,anything here of value besides the beans.
285,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,">> Yes, we do. We have the water cans."
286,00:16:58.12,00:16:58.12,We get back to camp and we know that there's two people on
287,00:17:01.42,00:17:01.42,"their way over from Jalapao to raid our camp, take whatever"
288,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,they want. And we know they're after the
289,00:17:06.88,00:17:06.88,beans. So all we're thinking is what
290,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,else could we convince them that they should take?
291,00:17:18.04,00:17:18.04,(applause) >> Welcome to our abode.
292,00:17:22.25,00:17:22.25,>> Y'all got a pretty place here.
293,00:17:25.38,00:17:25.38,>> Nice. >> Hey!
294,00:17:29.12,00:17:29.12,">> Tyson, good job. >> You, too, man."
295,00:17:31.75,00:17:31.75,">> Good game, man. >> It felt a little weird"
296,00:17:34.04,00:17:34.04,having those two guys from the other tribe come in.
297,00:17:39.08,00:17:39.08,">> Could we get you a cocktail? >> Yeah, if you don't mind."
298,00:17:41.42,00:17:41.42,>> You want to be on good terms with them 'cause you're probably
299,00:17:44.00,00:17:44.00,"going to be living with them in the future, but in the back of"
300,00:17:46.04,00:17:46.04,"your mind, you're like, ""I want to punch these guys in the"
301,00:17:48.38,00:17:48.38,"head."" >> Well, maybe we could, uh, use"
302,00:17:51.21,00:17:51.21,"a little way around the store, tell us which aisle it's on"
303,00:17:54.12,00:17:54.12,or something. >> All right.
304,00:17:55.29,00:17:55.29,">> Oh, no, you go find it. >> We know y'all got some extra"
305,00:17:59.08,00:17:59.08,food. We've been living on rice.
306,00:18:01.33,00:18:01.33,">> I'd be careful what you take. Just remember, you may end up"
307,00:18:06.12,00:18:06.12,"over here sometime. >> Oh, I know."
308,00:18:09.17,00:18:09.17,We're not going to leave you without food.
309,00:18:14.46,00:18:14.46,>> You know we have watering cans over here.
310,00:18:16.71,00:18:16.71,We hear you're boiling water. >> We might as well just take
311,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,a sack of beans and something else.
312,00:18:20.08,00:18:20.08,>> That's what I'm thinking. Take that sack; leave this.
313,00:18:22.29,00:18:22.29,>> Thanks. >> We're not going to take the
314,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,"rest of their beans, so we might as well just take this."
315,00:18:26.62,00:18:26.62,I think it's a very smart idea not to take both sacks of beans
316,00:18:29.88,00:18:29.88,because you have to look forward in this game.
317,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,There could be a switch at any time.
318,00:18:34.12,00:18:34.12,And if I was to end up over there on the Timbira Tribe with
319,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,"no beans 'cause I just stole both sacks, I'd be pissed."
320,00:18:39.88,00:18:39.88,">> Okay. >> All right, y'all."
321,00:18:42.46,00:18:42.46,">> Bye, Santa Claus. >> We'll see you guys."
322,00:18:44.38,00:18:44.38,>> See you guys. >> Thanks a lot.
323,00:18:45.79,00:18:45.79,>> Thank you. >> Whoa! Hello!
324,00:18:58.83,00:18:58.83,">> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! >> Welcome back."
325,00:19:02.96,00:19:02.96,">> It's good to be back, y'all. >> Who wants some beans?"
326,00:19:05.12,00:19:05.12,">> Oh, my God! What do you got?"
327,00:19:06.50,00:19:06.50,">> All right, so the real deal, though, is they had two bags of"
328,00:19:09.08,00:19:09.08,beans. >> Yeah.
329,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,">> One smaller bag... >> One, this is the bigger one."
330,00:19:12.38,00:19:12.38,>> You left their bag of beans? >> We left a bag of beans.
331,00:19:14.71,00:19:14.71,>> We left their smaller bag. >> But why do you want to leave
332,00:19:17.08,00:19:17.08,them food? >> In case we switch or
333,00:19:19.00,00:19:19.00,anything. >> Yeah.
334,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,>> They're probably thankful to you all that you just took a bag
335,00:19:22.54,00:19:22.54,"of beans. >> Oh, yeah."
336,00:19:23.46,00:19:23.46,We didn't take nothing from them.
337,00:19:24.79,00:19:24.79,"They still got beans, and they still got water containers."
338,00:19:26.67,00:19:26.67,"But, you know, there was nothing else to take."
339,00:19:30.46,00:19:30.46,">> You know, if they're thinking strategy, I don't think it's the"
340,00:19:33.04,00:19:33.04,"right strategy. You know, it's just, it's like"
341,00:19:35.29,00:19:35.29,"you've got a hundred guns, let's take 75 of them."
342,00:19:37.92,00:19:37.92,"You can have 25, oh, and maybe be able to take a shot at us."
343,00:19:41.21,00:19:41.21,">> Oh, my God. This is the happiest day of"
344,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,my life. >> Yeah.
345,00:19:44.29,00:19:44.29,">> Let's just pig out. >> What are they, pinto beans?"
346,00:19:46.12,00:19:46.12,>> Mixture. >> Yeah.
347,00:19:47.29,00:19:47.29,">> Oh, beans, just beans? Black beans? White beans?"
348,00:19:49.38,00:19:49.38,">> And pinto, I think. >> They are farting beans."
349,00:19:52.08,00:19:52.08,"(Sandy laughing) They are farting beans, honey."
350,00:19:57.83,00:19:57.83,">> Sandy's kind of starting to get on my nerves, as crazy as"
351,00:20:00.17,00:20:00.17,she is. She repeats everything at least
352,00:20:03.62,00:20:03.62,"three times. And it's starting to, I think,"
353,00:20:06.21,00:20:06.21,"wear on everybody, and not just me."
354,00:20:08.92,00:20:08.92,>> I did! You are always... >> I'm going to smack you.
355,00:20:11.00,00:20:11.00,">> No, isn't that true? It's always, I'm the one that's"
356,00:20:13.08,00:20:13.08,"like, ""Oh, no,"" this, that and the other, and there you go."
357,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,"But, anyway, y'all just do whatever you want."
358,00:20:17.38,00:20:17.38,">> Oh, wow. Look at this."
359,00:20:19.62,00:20:19.62,>> Thank the Lord for the beans. >> If I were choosing who was
360,00:20:33.58,00:20:33.58,leaving this tribe next... it would be Sydney.
361,00:20:39.29,00:20:39.29,Sydney is using everything she has from head to toe to enchant
362,00:20:42.92,00:20:42.92,every one of the boys. She runs around in their boxers
363,00:20:51.25,00:20:51.25,"and then, you know, doesn't sleep in her bra at night."
364,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,"And she is, like, up against the boys 24/7."
365,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17,"Trust me, she's playing this game hard and, uh, it's working."
366,00:21:02.12,00:21:02.12,"Oh, they love her to death. I still think they can see"
367,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,"through it, but they still like the package, you know?"
368,00:21:10.83,00:21:10.83,"They're going to put your name down there, you better do"
369,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,something. You better be pulling off more
370,00:21:14.75,00:21:14.75,than a bra. You better be pulling some
371,00:21:16.33,00:21:16.33,panties off or something. (laughing)
372,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,"Oh, you know, so I might have to trick her that way."
373,00:21:21.67,00:21:21.67,(laughs) If I can't outwit her with the

375,00:21:38.92,00:21:38.92,">> All right, choose an urn. >> See if it has anything in it."
376,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,"Usually, one of them does; one of them doesn't."
377,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,"Nothing's in there? Yup, I got the clue."
378,00:21:47.21,00:21:47.21,"Open in private. All right, I'll be right back."
379,00:21:52.04,00:21:52.04,"""Every day or two, you get mail from this place."
380,00:21:55.08,00:21:55.08,"If you find it round here, you'll ask, 'Why the long"

382,00:22:00.33,00:22:00.33,I knew it was the tree mail. >> Once Sierra and I arrived at
383,00:22:03.12,00:22:03.12,"Exile, we chose urns, and I got lucky and chose the one with"
384,00:22:06.71,00:22:06.71,the clue in it. It's exactly where I thought it
385,00:22:09.04,00:22:09.04,would be. It's back at my home camp at
386,00:22:11.54,00:22:11.54,"tree mail. When Brendan got back, he didn't"
387,00:22:15.67,00:22:15.67,didn't talk to you about himself at all?
388,00:22:18.58,00:22:18.58,>> No. >> Not one second?
389,00:22:21.62,00:22:21.62,Hmm... okay. I was kind of talking to Sierra
390,00:22:25.71,00:22:25.71,"down the road, trying to see where her head was at, and,"
391,00:22:28.08,00:22:28.08,"apparently, Brendan had never had a chance to fill her in on"
392,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,the plan. So I'll have to fill her in on
393,00:22:33.04,00:22:33.04,"everything. Okay, well, here's the deal."
394,00:22:35.21,00:22:35.21,"No one knows that you and Brendan are cool on your side,"
395,00:22:37.79,00:22:37.79,and no one knows that Steve and I are cool on my side.
396,00:22:40.38,00:22:40.38,"Once we get the two idols, we basically have security through"
397,00:22:43.17,00:22:43.17,"the merge. And once we get to the merge,"
398,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33,we'll have a secret four-way alliance that no one knows about
399,00:22:48.12,00:22:48.12,"and can't break up. This way, we can watch each"
400,00:22:50.33,00:22:50.33,others' backs when somebody's trying to blindside one of us.
401,00:22:52.50,00:22:52.50,We can warn them. We can take other people out
402,00:22:54.79,00:22:54.79,without them even knowing it. >> This is awesome.
403,00:23:00.08,00:23:00.08,This is an absolutely amazing plan.
404,00:23:01.83,00:23:01.83,"It just feels great that I built an alliance with Brendan,"
405,00:23:05.25,00:23:05.25,that I chose the right person who was smart enough to form an
406,00:23:07.88,00:23:07.88,"alliance to create this awesome foursome, ruling all the idols."
407,00:23:12.08,00:23:12.08,I started at the bottom of the food chain.
408,00:23:14.62,00:23:14.62,"I climbed my way to the middle, and now I'm at the top, baby."
409,00:23:18.96,00:23:18.96,">> Our concern is getting to the final four, which will be"
410,00:23:21.42,00:23:21.42,"you, me, Steve, and Brendan. Are you game?"
411,00:23:24.79,00:23:24.79,">> I'm game, game. >> Rock on."
412,00:23:26.38,00:23:26.38,>> I'm game. >> All right.
413,00:23:27.46,00:23:27.46,Team Secret is in place. >> It's amazing.
414,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,>> Is there anything that we should do today?
415,00:23:51.33,00:23:51.33,">> Hmm... rest? Eat, drink, and be merry."
416,00:23:55.04,00:23:55.04,>> That sounds great. >> Yeah.
417,00:23:56.62,00:23:56.62,>> I'd love to do that. >> I've been laying in the
418,00:23:58.71,00:23:58.71,"water. >> Today is just a relaxation,"
419,00:24:00.54,00:24:00.54,fun day. We're just kind of enjoying not
420,00:24:03.33,00:24:03.33,"having a lot of work to do. We needed to play, laugh, and"
421,00:24:06.17,00:24:06.17,have a little bit of fun because if you start getting
422,00:24:08.25,00:24:08.25,"down out here, all the different doors start opening: I miss my"
423,00:24:11.29,00:24:11.29,family; I miss my husband; I miss my children.
424,00:24:14.25,00:24:14.25,"You know, and so we've got to keep each other up."
425,00:24:16.83,00:24:16.83,>> I'm going tribal all over everybody's asses.
426,00:24:19.75,00:24:19.75,">> Dude, this is insane, man. >> Oh, my God!"
427,00:24:22.04,00:24:22.04,>> This is insane! >> Look at how ripe a tan I'm
428,00:24:24.29,00:24:24.29,going to get on my ass cheeks now.
429,00:24:26.79,00:24:26.79,I made this myself. >> You are the man.
430,00:24:29.21,00:24:29.21,This is hilarious. >> Imagine if I single-handedly
431,00:24:32.12,00:24:32.12,bring the loincloth back to civilized society.
432,00:24:34.96,00:24:34.96,(laughing) >> I can't breathe!
433,00:24:38.83,00:24:38.83,"I can't breathe. >> I said a-bunga, unga-bunga,"
434,00:24:41.00,00:24:41.00,"unga-bunga, unga-bunga. (laughing)"
435,00:24:43.88,00:24:43.88,">> Oh, my God! >> I don't know what it is, but"
436,00:24:49.21,00:24:49.21,I'm having a tough time finding a connection with these people.
437,00:24:53.04,00:24:53.04,"Before I came out here, I went through a really terrible"
438,00:24:56.75,00:24:56.75,breakup. I can't even carry on normal
439,00:24:59.33,00:24:59.33,conversations with people anymore.
440,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,It makes it hard to talk about everything because it's going
441,00:25:04.08,00:25:04.08,"to come up, and I don't... (voice breaking): This is what"
442,00:25:06.92,00:25:06.92,happens when it comes up. And I don't want to do this out
443,00:25:10.04,00:25:10.04,"here. >> For the most part, I've"
444,00:25:15.54,00:25:15.54,"written Erinn off. I mean, I haven't really talked"
445,00:25:19.04,00:25:19.04,to her one-on-one about anything.
446,00:25:21.96,00:25:21.96,And she doesn't hang out with the tribe a lot.
447,00:25:24.04,00:25:24.04,"Plus, I think she'll be really, really upset when she gets"
448,00:25:26.71,00:25:26.71,"voted off, and I'd like to see a freak-out at Tribal."
449,00:25:30.71,00:25:30.71,"I think that'll be fun. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

562,00:32:05.04,00:32:05.04,"long time. But right now, we're going to"
563,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,"go back to six on six. So it was just, overall, very"
564,00:32:09.71,00:32:09.71,"frustrating. >> We see all these words, but"
565,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,it's just like there is no rhyme or reason.
566,00:32:27.92,00:32:27.92,"God, it was just so random. >> I think it's the curse of"
567,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,the beans. >> I was not surprised that we
568,00:32:37.92,00:32:37.92,"lost because we went on a four-challenge winning streak,"
569,00:32:41.38,00:32:41.38,so I definitely thought that it was coming.
570,00:32:43.58,00:32:43.58,I just need to cool off. I'm so dehydrated.
571,00:32:46.25,00:32:46.25,Sierra and I found the last clue for the idol.
572,00:32:48.67,00:32:48.67,I know exactly where it is. I'll talk to Stephen as soon as
573,00:32:51.42,00:32:51.42,"I get a second, but right now, we need to focus on Tribal"
574,00:32:54.25,00:32:54.25,"Council. >> I mean, honestly, I'm kind"
575,00:33:03.83,00:33:03.83,"of glad, though. Not someone, but..."
576,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,"Someone... her names rhymes with ""Andy."""
577,00:33:14.46,00:33:14.46,"(Sydney laughs) >> Oh, Lord."
578,00:33:17.50,00:33:17.50,"So what are we going to do tonight, y'all?"
579,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,">> What do y'all think? >> Oh, God..."
580,00:33:22.83,00:33:22.83,>> I don't know. I know I don't want to go home.
581,00:33:25.42,00:33:25.42,>> I don't want to go home. >> I'd also like not to go home.
582,00:33:28.04,00:33:28.04,">> Honestly, I'm going to put this out there."
583,00:33:30.42,00:33:30.42,I think Sandy was stronger than Sydney in the last two
584,00:33:33.04,00:33:33.04,"competitions, honestly. >> The problem if we eliminate"
585,00:33:36.00,00:33:36.00,"Sydney, Spencer and Joe both are going to be..."
586,00:33:38.79,00:33:38.79,">> They're going to turn on us. >> Has she been really, like,"
587,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"the catalyst in the challenges? >> You know, she's strong."
588,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,"She's not that strong in challenges, you're right."
589,00:33:49.17,00:33:49.17,"I mean, she's, you know, a nice presence around camp."
590,00:33:53.12,00:33:53.12,She works hard. She works hard around camp.
591,00:33:57.79,00:33:57.79,">> Yeah, yeah, we do. >> I've got mixed emotions."
592,00:34:02.29,00:34:02.29,"I don't feel bad and I don't feel good, you know?"
593,00:34:05.29,00:34:05.29,"Taj is leaning towards Sydney, and she said I'm doing better"
594,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"in the challenges, actually, than Sydney, but we'll see."
595,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,I think maybe J.T. and them are telling me the truth and I'm
596,00:34:14.42,00:34:14.42,going to be here tomorrow. >> It's up to y'all.
597,00:34:17.88,00:34:17.88,Just let me and know I'll do whatever y'all want me to do.
598,00:34:20.62,00:34:20.62,>> I will. The important thing is now is
599,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17,figuring out am I going to send Sandy home or am I going to
600,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,send Sydney home? I have a big dilemma right now.
601,00:34:28.38,00:34:28.38,I'm not sure what I want to do. >> I was excited to meet other
602,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,people who I would never get a chance to meet.
603,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,"And also just to see how I would like, fare."
604,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,">> I like the sneakiness of it, too, 'cause I'm not very sneaky"
605,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,"back home, you know? So you get to be sneaky in a"
606,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,"new environment. >> Oh, really?"
607,00:35:09.62,00:35:09.62,>> So you're being sneaky? That's interesting.
608,00:35:11.08,00:35:11.08,">> Yeah, I'm glad you told me that."
609,00:35:13.42,00:35:13.42,">> That's good information. >> All of y'all are sneaky, too,"
610,00:35:15.96,00:35:15.96,so don't even start with me. >> Sydney's good looks make a
611,00:35:20.58,00:35:20.58,"positive first impression, but that could be, you know, part"
612,00:35:25.08,00:35:25.08,"of her devious personality. If there's a merge coming up,"
613,00:35:28.25,00:35:28.25,"we need strong members, but we also need loyal members, so"
614,00:35:31.29,00:35:31.29,getting rid of Sydney could make a lot of sense.
615,00:35:39.79,00:35:39.79,">> As far I know, the vote's going to be going on to Sandy K."
616,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,tonight. I feel like I've tried to get
617,00:35:48.17,00:35:48.17,"on the good sides of people, so, hopefully, it's not me."
618,00:35:51.92,00:35:51.92,"But then again, it's Survivor. So, you know, everyone wants to"
619,00:35:54.58,00:35:54.58,win. So we'll see.
620,00:36:17.58,00:36:17.58,">> PROBST: Sandy, going back to day one, you were out of this"
621,00:36:20.29,00:36:20.29,"game. Here we are on day 12, you're"
622,00:36:22.62,00:36:22.62,still sitting pretty. Have you recovered from that
623,00:36:25.04,00:36:25.04,first impression? >> I believe I did recover.
624,00:36:28.12,00:36:28.12,"I fit in with this gang quite well, given the fact that, uh,"
625,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,"you know, I'm the older woman. So, yeah, it makes me feel good."
626,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,"Believe me. >> PROBST: J.T., how did Sandy"
627,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,recover from such an awful start?
628,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,">> Well, Sandy's kind of the mother of the crowd."
629,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,She takes care of us and frees us up to do the hard work.
630,00:36:45.79,00:36:45.79,">> PROBST: Sandy, do you spend any time at all reflecting on"
631,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,your age when you're spending so much time with people that
632,00:36:51.96,00:36:51.96,"are considerably younger and relatively speaking,"
633,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,"a good-looking group of people? >> Yes, the old age factor"
634,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,"plays a part in that, but, you know, I bring them a lot of"
635,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,laughs and so forth. But I think people might use
636,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,"their, maybe, a little bit of their beauty or their body, you"
637,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,know? I've seen a little bit of
638,00:37:10.08,00:37:10.08,"flirting going on as far as Sydney is concerned, you know?"
639,00:37:12.42,00:37:12.42,"Maybe wearing the boxer shorts of J.T., you know."
640,00:37:16.54,00:37:16.54,">> PROBST: J.T., is she wearing your boxers?"
641,00:37:18.75,00:37:18.75,">> Yeah, Jeff, she's wearing my boxers."
642,00:37:22.62,00:37:22.62,>> It's hot out there. I don't have shorts.
643,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,I'm wearing jeans. >> PROBST: Nobody asked you to
644,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,"defend. >> I know, that's all I'm"
645,00:37:29.50,00:37:29.50,"saying though. >> PROBST: Joe, do you see that"
646,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,going on? >> Yeah.
647,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,"Yeah, I see flirting going on. >> PROBST: Stephen, fair part"
648,00:37:38.21,00:37:38.21,"of the game? If you're a young, beautiful"
649,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,"woman, why not try to use it to influence the guys?"
650,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,">> First of all, I should say that the big flirting"
651,00:37:44.46,00:37:44.46,"relationship has not been mentioned yet, which is between"
652,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,Sydney and Joe. They flirt maybe a little more
653,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"than J.T. and Sydney flirt. >> PROBST: Sydney, you were"
654,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,"nodding your head and smiling. >> Yeah, I mean, I have a"
655,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,flirtatious personality. I flirt with women.
656,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,I definitely flirt with Joe. He's a great guy.
657,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,I get along with him really well.
658,00:38:02.08,00:38:02.08,"It's just inevitable for me, I think."
659,00:38:04.21,00:38:04.21,">> PROBST: Taj, how's that sit with you?"
660,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,">> First of all, let's just say Sydney is gorgeous."
661,00:38:08.54,00:38:08.54,"So men are definitely going to be attracted to her,"
662,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,regardless. They can't help themselves.
663,00:38:12.67,00:38:12.67,"So if there's an alliance, it would be with her and not me"
664,00:38:15.58,00:38:15.58,because she probably what they want to align with anyway.
665,00:38:18.29,00:38:18.29,And that's okay because I'll make my way through the game
666,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,regardless. >> PROBST: Hold on.
667,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"""That's okay""? >> It's okay with me, oh, yeah."
668,00:38:24.54,00:38:24.54,>> PROBST: I don't buy that for a second.
669,00:38:26.58,00:38:26.58,>> I have to accept the fact that they are attracted to her.
670,00:38:29.21,00:38:29.21,They're not attracted to me. That's okay with me.
671,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,I'll be all right with or without their attraction.
672,00:38:34.21,00:38:34.21,">> PROBST: Sydney, does this happen to you a lot?"
673,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,Conversations end up revolving around your looks?
674,00:38:38.96,00:38:38.96,">> Yeah, it happens a lot. My profession is a model, you"
675,00:38:41.38,00:38:41.38,know? So people stereotype me as the
676,00:38:43.92,00:38:43.92,blonde girl who doesn't have a lot to stay and sits there and
677,00:38:46.50,00:38:46.50,"be pretty. But, that doesn't mean, like..."
678,00:38:50.21,00:38:50.21,I don't know. It's hard to explain.
679,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,">> PROBST: Stephen, could that work against Sydney?"
680,00:38:54.83,00:38:54.83,">> Definitely. I mean, someone could think,"
681,00:38:57.21,00:38:57.21,"""Oh, she's just a flirt; she's nothing,"" and just undervalue"
682,00:38:59.92,00:38:59.92,"her throughout the game. >> PROBST: Sandy, how will this"
683,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,tribe be different tomorrow? >> I think there might be a
684,00:39:07.12,00:39:07.12,"person or two upset, depending on the outcome."
685,00:39:10.71,00:39:10.71,I imagine there'll be a couple of real upsets.
686,00:39:13.29,00:39:13.29,"So tomorrow will tell the story. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
687,00:39:18.25,00:39:18.25,"vote. Joe, you're up."
688,00:39:34.83,00:39:34.83,>> It's just your time to go. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
689,00:40:12.08,00:40:12.08,votes. If anybody has the hidden
690,00:40:27.21,00:40:27.21,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
691,00:40:29.79,00:40:29.79,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
692,00:40:34.50,00:40:34.50,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
693,00:40:36.58,00:40:36.58,asked to leave Tribal Council area immediately.
694,00:40:38.67,00:40:38.67,I'll read the votes. First vote: Sandy.
695,00:40:49.21,00:40:49.21,Sydney. One vote Sandy; one vote Sydney.
696,00:40:55.67,00:40:55.67,Joe. One vote Sandy;
697,00:40:57.96,00:40:57.96,one vote Sydney; one vote Joe.
698,00:41:02.17,00:41:02.17,Sandy. That's two votes Sandy;
699,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,one vote Sydney; one vote Joe. Sandy.
700,00:41:10.08,00:41:10.08,">> Oh, boy. >> PROBST: That's three votes"
701,00:41:12.08,00:41:12.08,Sandy; one vote Sydney; one vote Joe.
702,00:41:17.88,00:41:17.88,Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins: Sandy.
703,00:41:20.62,00:41:20.62,That's four. That's enough.
704,00:41:22.29,00:41:22.29,"You need to bring me your torch. Sandy, the tribe has spoken."
705,00:41:35.62,00:41:35.62,"Time for you to go. Well, after tonight's vote,"
706,00:41:50.88,00:41:50.88,both tribes are even: six-six. Brand-new game.
707,00:41:54.71,00:41:54.71,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
708,00:41:56.33,00:41:56.33,Good night.  Captioning sponsored by

715,00:42:21.25,00:42:21.25,cross-Tribal alliance might not be so secret.
716,00:42:28.88,00:42:28.88,>> And I'm sick of this game. >> PROBST: And Taj acts out.
717,00:42:32.21,00:42:32.21,>> Everybody can kiss my ass. >> Moves like that will get you
718,00:42:34.29,00:42:34.29,voted off. >> I'm hot today.

720,00:42:44.25,00:42:44.25,day without anybody knowing me or anything.
721,00:42:46.50,00:42:46.50,And then I kind of got in with them.
722,00:42:48.92,00:42:48.92,"I was like the mother, uh, mother hen over all these little"
723,00:42:52.04,00:42:52.04,ducks. And I stayed around a lot
724,00:42:54.25,00:42:54.25,longer than I thought I was going to.
725,00:42:56.79,00:42:56.79,"And, uh, I didn't quit. So I'm real proud of myself."
