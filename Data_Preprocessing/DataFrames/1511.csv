158,00:11:17.96,00:11:17.96,"because we're still, like, incrazy rags and we stink."
159,00:11:20.88,00:11:20.88,>> Here we are sitting in thelap of luxury like millionaires
160,00:11:23.25,00:11:23.25,eating.>> You and I didn't have to win.

168,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,We could get James to go withus.
169,00:12:04.08,00:12:04.08,That's four of us.That would be the majority.
170,00:12:06.42,00:12:06.42,"We could pick off... who wouldit be, Todd?"
171,00:12:09.21,00:12:09.21,What do you think about that?>> You never know what's going

192,00:13:50.12,00:13:50.12,"come up, this is the one Iwanted to go on the most."
193,00:13:53.75,00:13:53.75,"The Shaolin Temple.It's 1,500 years old."
194,00:13:56.38,00:13:56.38,"I mean, just to look around andsee over 1,000 years of culture"
195,00:14:00.21,00:14:00.21,and the beginnings of the actualmartial arts themselves is just
196,00:14:04.58,00:14:04.58,so incredible for me.It's just an amazing thing.
197,00:14:22.83,00:14:22.83,"The demonstration was fantastic.I mean, it takes years of"
198,00:14:25.17,00:14:25.17,"practice just to get a singleform down, and these guys were"
199,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,doing it with hardly any effort.>> After the main kung fu
200,00:15:22.17,00:15:22.17,"exhibition, the cutest kids cameout."
201,00:15:25.50,00:15:25.50,"Denise and Peih-Gee and I wereallowed to go down, and they"

209,00:16:17.46,00:16:17.46,thank Peih-Gee enough forpicking me for this reward.
210,00:16:19.75,00:16:19.75,"To take that experience backhome for the rest of my life,"
211,00:16:23.62,00:16:23.62,there's no words to reallydescribe that.
212,00:16:31.12,00:16:31.12,>> Wow!Do we just dig in?
213,00:16:33.46,00:16:33.46,>> I guess so.>> We've forgotten what to do

232,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,"was crazy.Like, you couldn't... I don't"
233,00:17:28.17,00:17:28.17,"think you could, like, pay to dosomething like that."
234,00:17:34.17,00:17:34.17,My neck is still on the line.People still want me out.
235,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,"But being at the temple, itreally gives me inspiration, you"

258,00:19:21.17,00:19:21.17,and we had pistachios and abottle of champagne.
259,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,We get there and we walkedaround and they showed us a bit
260,00:19:25.21,00:19:25.21,of the stuff.>> You're lying.

267,00:19:43.67,00:19:43.67,"It's like, you know, Peih-Geecomes sidling up in there."
268,00:19:45.46,00:19:45.46,"And I'm like, ""I'm going to killyou."""

273,00:20:17.17,00:20:17.17,>> Man.Man.
274,00:20:19.58,00:20:19.58,Peih-Gee is not my idea of fun.She is annoying as hell.
275,00:20:22.67,00:20:22.67,"She goes to Denise and is like,""We should vote out Todd, dah,"
276,00:20:25.29,00:20:25.29,"dah, dah.""And I'm thinking, ""Bitch, do you"
277,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,expect anybody to get up on yourside?

282,00:21:22.29,00:21:22.29,Erik's not that smart.If I were to go from nice happy
283,00:21:25.38,00:21:25.38,five to the evil two... I'm notgoing to eat that apple.
284,00:21:27.21,00:21:27.21,"They can tempt me all they want,but I'm just not having it."
285,00:21:29.29,00:21:29.29,He should know that.He should know that I'm really
286,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,not going to flip on nobody.It's pointless.
287,00:22:02.62,00:22:02.62,>> I'm over the bamboo.>> Yeah.
288,00:22:12.46,00:22:12.46,">> Oh, gosh.""Practice, practice, practice,"

296,00:22:41.25,00:22:41.25,"Because the thing is, to getJames out, he can't expect it,"
297,00:22:43.88,00:22:43.88,and he doesn't expect it rightnow.
298,00:22:46.58,00:22:46.58,"I came up with a plan to get ridof James, because he's in"
299,00:22:49.29,00:22:49.29,"control right now, because hehas the immunity idols."
300,00:22:52.17,00:22:52.17,So he definitely has to beblindsided tonight.

302,00:22:58.42,00:22:58.42,right now.And he deserves to win a million
303,00:23:01.12,00:23:01.12,dollars.I would give James a million
304,00:23:02.92,00:23:02.92,dollars.He's done the most around camp.
305,00:23:05.08,00:23:05.08,"He's been, like, crazy good inchallenges."
306,00:23:08.83,00:23:08.83,There's no other time to get ridof James other than right now.
307,00:23:12.17,00:23:12.17,">> Okay, that sounds good.>> Is that a good idea?"
308,00:23:14.21,00:23:14.21,">> Yeah.>> James keeps telling everyone,"

427,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,we just have to continue toconvince him that we're voting
428,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,"Peih-Gee out-- basically, lie tohis face, which hurts really"
429,00:31:56.25,00:31:56.25,"bad, especially since I like theguy."
430,00:32:00.67,00:32:00.67,"But I like a million dollars,too."
431,00:32:12.04,00:32:12.04,>> I hope we can keepredeeming ourself.
432,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,"Erik, look at this.There's one last card I could"
433,00:32:33.75,00:32:33.75,"play, which is that I'm prettysure that James has the immunity"
434,00:32:36.04,00:32:36.04,idol.So I'm going to try.
435,00:32:38.25,00:32:38.25,I'm still going to talk tothem and see.
436,00:32:40.25,00:32:40.25,"I don't want to go out without afight, you know?"

442,00:34:14.04,00:34:14.04,"kind of good, but then I'mrisking a lot by doing that."
443,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,">> That girl there, she's on herhustle."
444,00:34:28.12,00:34:28.12,>> I know.>> Which I don't blame her.
