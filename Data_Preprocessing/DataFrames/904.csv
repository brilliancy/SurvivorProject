3,00:00:05.08,00:00:05.08,explaining to do. >> How the hell did the
4,00:00:07.12,00:00:07.12,vote switch to Dolly? >> I thought she was
5,00:00:09.25,00:00:09.25,"writing my name down. >> How about clueing us in,"
6,00:00:12.21,00:00:12.21,Eliza? >> I'm not so sure Eliza
7,00:00:14.00,00:00:14.00,is in with us. Even then I don't know if I
8,00:00:15.83,00:00:15.83,"trust her, but I've got a backup plan."
9,00:00:18.38,00:00:18.38,">> PROBST: At Lopevi, Rory was fed up with Sarge's military"
10,00:00:20.71,00:00:20.71,ways. >> Do you feel I'm not
11,00:00:22.79,00:00:22.79,pulling my weight? >> I saw you going on a lot
12,00:00:24.50,00:00:24.50,of walks. >> Sarge wants to dictate
13,00:00:26.50,00:00:26.50,"when people take a crap, when you sit down, when you work, and"
14,00:00:30.83,00:00:30.83,"I don't take orders real well. >> PROBST: At Yasur, Twila and"
15,00:00:34.17,00:00:34.17,Mia had it out over the division of labor.
16,00:00:36.92,00:00:36.92,>> You take the martyr and you play on that role!
17,00:00:39.29,00:00:39.29,>> You stay here five minutes and then your ass goes down...
18,00:00:42.71,00:00:42.71,I'll whup the little scrawny bitch's ass.
19,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33,"I ain't here to make no friends. >> PROBST: At the challenge, the"
20,00:00:47.88,00:00:47.88,tribes got a big surprise. Today you are playing for both
21,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,reward and immunity. Here's the twist.
22,00:00:55.12,00:00:55.12,Both tribes will vote out one member tonight.
23,00:00:58.12,00:00:58.12,>> No! >> PROBST: Separate Tribal
24,00:01:00.54,00:01:00.54,"Councils, two people going home."
25,00:01:03.00,00:01:03.00,In the first of two rounds Lopevi won the reward.
26,00:01:05.33,00:01:05.33,"Lopevi, congratulations. You now have a Hawaiian sling,"
27,00:01:09.46,00:01:09.46,fishing gear and a mask. The men also won the
28,00:01:13.08,00:01:13.08,opportunity to play for individual immunity while the
29,00:01:16.17,00:01:16.17,women sat out. It was John K. who won the
30,00:01:19.21,00:01:19.21,necklace and a little something extra.
31,00:01:21.71,00:01:21.71,"John, you're now going to leave and go back to camp with Yasur."
32,00:01:27.04,00:01:27.04,"You'll be gathering information for a very big decision,"
33,00:01:30.12,00:01:30.12,"because tonight when your Tribal is over, you will stay"
34,00:01:33.04,00:01:33.04,behind. You will give your immunity to
35,00:01:35.42,00:01:35.42,"one member from Yasur. >> PROBST: At Yasur, John"
36,00:01:38.50,00:01:38.50,witnessed a tribe divided. >> You just keep saying you
37,00:01:41.42,00:01:41.42,"don't want there to be a tie. >> I don't trust you, Eliza."
38,00:01:44.67,00:01:44.67,>> Don't trust me. >> I could care a less who gets
39,00:01:48.00,00:01:48.00,voted off of this tribe. I just want them to not be mad
40,00:01:51.17,00:01:51.17,at me for whoever gets voted off.
41,00:01:53.21,00:01:53.21,>> PROBST: At Lopevi's Tribal Council John K. reunited with
42,00:01:56.04,00:01:56.04,"his tribe, and even though Rory got three votes the alliance of"
43,00:02:00.12,00:02:00.12,elders held and J.P. was voted out.
44,00:02:03.92,00:02:03.92,"J.P., the tribe has spoken. John K. stayed behind for"
45,00:02:08.33,00:02:08.33,Yasur's Tribal Council. You know who you're giving it
46,00:02:10.67,00:02:10.67,to? >> Yeah.
47,00:02:12.71,00:02:12.71,>> PROBST: Give it up. And in an attempt to
48,00:02:14.58,00:02:14.58,not ruffle any feathers John gave immunity to Ami who was
49,00:02:17.21,00:02:17.21,not in danger of being voted out.
50,00:02:20.08,00:02:20.08,When it came time to vote it was Lisa who betrayed the young
51,00:02:23.08,00:02:23.08,girl's alliance by helping to vote out Mia.
52,00:02:27.46,00:02:27.46,"Mia, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left."
53,00:02:34.38,00:02:34.38,Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by

55,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,>> You talk about telling the truth.
56,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,>> I told you that. >> That was before I thought
57,00:03:54.25,00:03:54.25,that there was somebody who was going to flip.
58,00:03:56.33,00:03:56.33,I'm sorry I ever apologized almost.
59,00:03:58.54,00:03:58.54,>> I'm sorry you took it that way and that's how it is.
60,00:04:01.71,00:04:01.71,It is what it is. >> The vote at Tribal Council
61,00:04:06.04,00:04:06.04,shocked the hell out of me. Lisa was supposedly in an
62,00:04:09.67,00:04:09.67,"alliance with me, Julie and Mia, so when she voted against Mia,"
63,00:04:14.46,00:04:14.46,"that totally blindsided me and I was like, ""That bitch."""
64,00:04:19.83,00:04:19.83,">> You know what, honest the truth, I didn't trust you,"
65,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,"so there you go. Really, it all comes down to"
66,00:04:24.88,00:04:24.88,"you, Eliza. It all comes down to you."
67,00:04:27.42,00:04:27.42,">> The night before, I had voted for Dolly behind Lisa's"
68,00:04:30.83,00:04:30.83,"back and then I apologized, apologized, apologized."
69,00:04:33.88,00:04:33.88,"Finally, she forgave me and then she did the exact same thing."
70,00:04:36.88,00:04:36.88,That makes you seem like kind of a hypocrite.
71,00:04:39.42,00:04:39.42,">> You know what, I had a right and I changed my mind."
72,00:04:41.38,00:04:41.38,I'm not going to be confrontational.
73,00:04:43.04,00:04:43.04,I did what I did and I'm not going to argue with you.
74,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,I told you I didn't trust you and I meant it.
75,00:04:47.17,00:04:47.17,I've been giving the truth all along.
76,00:04:49.29,00:04:49.29,>> Except today. >> You have the nerve.
77,00:04:52.04,00:04:52.04,"You have your nerve. >> You know what, guys?"
78,00:04:55.00,00:04:55.00,My environment is a little polluted here.
79,00:04:57.08,00:04:57.08,I'm going to go to bed. I love all of you and I'll
80,00:04:59.12,00:04:59.12,talk to you tomorrow. >> I just want us all to
81,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,"become a strong team. If we want to beat these guys,"
82,00:05:04.79,00:05:04.79,we need to be tough and we need strong inner and outer.
83,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,"I don't know how to get there, but we need to get there and"
84,00:05:10.46,00:05:10.46,I'm going to sleep because I'm tired.
85,00:05:12.96,00:05:12.96,>> I wasn't surprised about Eliza or Julie getting mad
86,00:05:16.38,00:05:16.38,"at me, but I voted for who I felt like I needed to vote for"
87,00:05:20.17,00:05:20.17,"last night, so let them get mad. I would much rather be in an"
88,00:05:24.21,00:05:24.21,"alliance with the older group. >> Guys, I'm going to have to"
89,00:05:27.54,00:05:27.54,switch with somebody. >> I'm furious.
90,00:05:30.08,00:05:30.08,"I do not trust Lisa, not one bit."
91,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,I'm going to be civil to her and and pretend to be unified
92,00:05:35.88,00:05:35.88,"because that's what everybody wants, but if she were gone"
93,00:05:38.54,00:05:38.54,tomorrow I would be thrilled. She repulses me now.
94,00:05:59.96,00:05:59.96,">> That was hairy for me last night, getting three votes."
95,00:06:02.21,00:06:02.21,>> It's a gut check. >> Getting those three votes.
96,00:06:04.75,00:06:04.75,"I took three votes last night in Tribal Council, and"
97,00:06:09.12,00:06:09.12,yet that doesn't really bother me a whole lot.
98,00:06:13.83,00:06:13.83,>> Our five strong is invincible.
99,00:06:16.46,00:06:16.46,We need to stay the course and we have no worries.
100,00:06:18.62,00:06:18.62,"It's all about the numbers, baby."
101,00:06:20.42,00:06:20.42,">> The fact of the matter is, I've got an agreement with"
102,00:06:22.58,00:06:22.58,"Chad, Travis, Sarge and Chris. That's already a numbers game"
103,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,that works for me. >> I can't stand the
104,00:06:37.71,00:06:37.71,way that this tribe ended up. The good young guys that have
105,00:06:41.00,00:06:41.00,great personalities and are good athletes are all gone.
106,00:06:44.46,00:06:44.46,Why are we letting fat dudes run the show?
107,00:06:48.75,00:06:48.75,This doesn't make any sense to me.
108,00:06:51.21,00:06:51.21,I don't know what these guys are doing.
109,00:06:53.54,00:06:53.54,>> Yeah. Setting us up for losing
110,00:06:55.25,00:06:55.25,challenges and such. >> I don't blame Rory for doing
111,00:06:58.88,00:06:58.88,"it, but Bubba and Chad. >> Just because it's easy"
112,00:07:02.25,00:07:02.25,and a sure thing. It's an easy numbers game right
113,00:07:05.04,00:07:05.04,now. They don't have to think very
114,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,far down the road. I don't know why they think
115,00:07:10.04,00:07:10.04,"their plan will work. None of them are very athletic,"
116,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,and the bottom line is a lot of these challenges are physical
117,00:07:16.25,00:07:16.25,"so we'll see what happens. >> The fab five, as long"
118,00:07:26.96,00:07:26.96,"as they got their five, which they have had since day one"
119,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,there's not much left up in the air.
120,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,The only thing I can physically do myself I think is the
121,00:07:35.12,00:07:35.12,fishing. If I can endear myself enough
122,00:07:39.50,00:07:39.50,"with the fishing, that may change one or two people's"
123,00:07:42.83,00:07:42.83,minds. Wish me luck.
124,00:07:45.71,00:07:45.71,>> Good luck. >> Good luck.
125,00:08:02.04,00:08:02.04,Got one already. >> Yeah.
126,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,I got him. Give it a chance to grow up.
127,00:08:14.17,00:08:14.17,>> I got little fish and its brother littler.
128,00:08:17.46,00:08:17.46,The seem like the only fish dumb enough to get hit by the
129,00:08:19.46,00:08:19.46,"spear are the small ones. >> Good job, brother!"
130,00:08:23.46,00:08:23.46,I wouldn't shoot something that small because that
131,00:08:27.04,00:08:27.04,wouldn't even fill one person. >> You know what if they
132,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,"are offering themselves up to me, we can at least throw them"
133,00:08:33.92,00:08:33.92,"in there. John and I, it's getting"
134,00:08:36.75,00:08:36.75,down to the nitty-gritty. Hopefully we'll figure out a
135,00:08:40.12,00:08:40.12,way to shake up the game and change the dynamics of what's
136,00:08:43.21,00:08:43.21,going on right now because something's got to happen.
137,00:08:56.46,00:08:56.46,">> Tree mail. >> Oh, my God, look."
138,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,"Oh... oh, my God. ""So you think you're living"
139,00:09:03.33,00:09:03.33,"like the natives, but are they as hungry or as cold?"""
140,00:09:06.17,00:09:06.17,">> ""Frustrated by your lack of food, your shivering"
141,00:09:08.75,00:09:08.75,"must get old."" >> ""Well, put your minds"
142,00:09:11.08,00:09:11.08,"together and maybe you'll discover...."""
143,00:09:13.25,00:09:13.25,">> ""Help is on the way, and you'll find it under cover."""
144,00:09:16.92,00:09:16.92,>> Pig. >> Pig roast.
145,00:09:19.25,00:09:19.25,>> Shell... piggie. >> It's a memory thing.
146,00:09:23.12,00:09:23.12,>> I am so friggin' good at this.
147,00:09:25.08,00:09:25.08,>> Really? >> I think we have a lot
148,00:09:27.96,00:09:27.96,"better memory than the men do. >> Oh, my God, it's beautiful."
149,00:09:30.29,00:09:30.29,">> There's a rainbow. >> Oh, my God!"
150,00:09:32.92,00:09:32.92,">> Yay, that means we're going to win."
151,00:09:46.62,00:09:46.62,">> PROBST: So catch me up. Yasur, how is life at camp?"
152,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,">> Peaceful, good relations, nice rest."
153,00:09:54.42,00:09:54.42,">> PROBST: Scout, how could life be better?"
154,00:09:56.29,00:09:56.29,>> If we knew a little bit more about finding food and
155,00:09:58.67,00:09:58.67,"making something different, that would be great."
156,00:10:01.12,00:10:01.12,">> PROBST: Lopevi, what's going on with your camp?"
157,00:10:03.83,00:10:03.83,">> Once we finally got that spear, just spent a lot of"
158,00:10:06.67,00:10:06.67,time out in the water and taking a lot of shots you eventually
159,00:10:09.12,00:10:09.12,"hit some fish. Most of them are, you know, a"
160,00:10:11.67,00:10:11.67,"bite or two, but I'm getting better at it."
161,00:10:13.67,00:10:13.67,We're going to have more fish. >> PROBST: Okay.
162,00:10:16.00,00:10:16.00,Shall we get to today's challenge?
163,00:10:18.08,00:10:18.08,>> Mm-hmm. >> Let's do it.
164,00:10:20.08,00:10:20.08,>> PROBST: It's for reward and it's a very simple memory test.
165,00:10:22.88,00:10:22.88,There are 15 pairs of items covered in the field.
166,00:10:26.12,00:10:26.12,"Your goal, pair up matching items, one tribe member at a"

169,00:10:36.33,00:10:36.33,playing for? >> Yeah.
170,00:10:38.08,00:10:38.08,">> All right. >> PROBST: Da, mith."
171,00:10:43.21,00:10:43.21,>> All right. We're going to learn something.
172,00:10:47.00,00:10:47.00,>> PROBST: This is Da. Da's from the Amberian tribe.
173,00:10:50.21,00:10:50.21,He's going to spend the next 24 hours with the winners of this
174,00:10:53.38,00:10:53.38,"challenge. Put it simply, Da is a rock star"
175,00:10:56.38,00:10:56.38,when it comes to living on the island.
176,00:10:59.08,00:10:59.08,He doesn't speak a lot of English.
177,00:11:01.62,00:11:01.62,"You're going to have to draw information out of him, but he"
178,00:11:03.58,00:11:03.58,"knows how to find food, how to catch food and how to cook food."
179,00:11:06.88,00:11:06.88,"He knows how to better your shelter, how to improve overall"
180,00:11:09.67,00:11:09.67,your living situation. You've only been out here nine
181,00:11:12.67,00:11:12.67,"days, you still have 30 days left if you make it all the"
182,00:11:15.12,00:11:15.12,way. This could completely change
183,00:11:17.42,00:11:17.42,the way you live from here on out.
184,00:11:19.75,00:11:19.75,Worth playing for? >> Yeah.
185,00:11:21.17,00:11:21.17,>> Sure. >> PROBST: All right.
186,00:11:22.50,00:11:22.50,Take your spots. Wait for my go.
187,00:11:26.96,00:11:26.96,"Okay, Lopevi won the right to go first."
188,00:11:30.04,00:11:30.04,"Chad, you're up. Wooden pig."

210,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,Not too excited by the palm frond.
211,00:13:15.75,00:13:15.75,>> All right. Got it.

219,00:13:41.42,00:13:41.42,something familiar or something new?

234,00:14:42.79,00:14:42.79,"Sarge, getting his first shot at the course, wasting no time,"

236,00:14:53.83,00:14:53.83,They are finally on the board. That's 4-1.
237,00:14:57.38,00:14:57.38,Yasur needs just one more match to win it.

242,00:15:15.62,00:15:15.62,"Guys, still alive. There's the first coconut and"

246,00:15:31.46,00:15:31.46,and they win the services of Da.
247,00:15:36.08,00:15:36.08,There's the nautilus shell. Lisa stumbled upon the nautilus
248,00:15:40.29,00:15:40.29,shell. Can she remember where the
249,00:15:42.67,00:15:42.67,other one is? She's seem very confident with
250,00:15:45.62,00:15:45.62,her skip. There it is.
251,00:15:50.25,00:15:50.25,Yasur wins reward. >> You are just the girl to
252,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,bring it home. Good job.

262,00:16:27.46,00:16:27.46,>> PROBST: You guys head back to camp.
263,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,He has his own way of getting there.
264,00:16:32.46,00:16:32.46,"He'll meet you there. >> You guys, I see him coming."
265,00:16:58.33,00:16:58.33,Should we be on the beach to welcome him?
266,00:17:01.12,00:17:01.12,I'm so excited. >> At the challenge today we won
267,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"an island expert for 24 hours. His name is Da, and he's"
268,00:17:09.42,00:17:09.42,"supposed to know everything about these islands, how to"
269,00:17:12.21,00:17:12.21,"hunt, fish, cook, shelter, anything we need to know, he's"
270,00:17:15.50,00:17:15.50,"supposed to know it so we want to learn from him, busy when"
271,00:17:19.42,00:17:19.42,"he's gone, that's it. >> Hello."
272,00:17:24.46,00:17:24.46,">> Hola. >> Da, came up on the"
273,00:17:34.88,00:17:34.88,"beach, we all came to greet him. We were going to stop and"
274,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83,introduce ourselves. No time for that.
275,00:17:42.25,00:17:42.25,"He came in here with a purpose. >> Oh, my God."
276,00:17:58.88,00:17:58.88,>> Hurry. >> Wow.
277,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,>> Good. >> That would take us about a
278,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,half an hour. >> (speaking native language)
279,00:18:20.54,00:18:20.54,>> Watch how he does that. Holy Toledo.
280,00:18:24.21,00:18:24.21,">> It was right there. >> Da, he like pulled up"
281,00:18:28.33,00:18:28.33,"a root and he's like, have you been eating this?"
282,00:18:30.83,00:18:30.83,"We're like no, and he chops it, and he's like, here you go."
283,00:18:34.42,00:18:34.42,>> Keep an eye on him and he just keeps walking and we
284,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,were just chasing to keep up to him.
285,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,>> Cut it off? Cook 'em and eat 'em.
286,00:18:43.21,00:18:43.21,>> Yeah. >> Who knew we had all
287,00:18:45.17,00:18:45.17,this food in our backyard and we thought it was all gone.
288,00:18:48.25,00:18:48.25,We just didn't know what to eat.
289,00:18:52.12,00:18:52.12,>> There's something else. >> It looks like bamboo.
290,00:18:55.17,00:18:55.17,>> In between the long cornstalks.
291,00:19:00.71,00:19:00.71,>> Sugar cane. Sugar.
292,00:19:06.38,00:19:06.38,">> We've got sugar cane, which is just unbelievable."
293,00:19:09.25,00:19:09.25,That's everybody's favorite. >> That's the best thing ever.
294,00:19:12.92,00:19:12.92,>> What is that? >> Eat.
295,00:19:15.58,00:19:15.58,>> Nut. >> Da seemed to understand us
296,00:19:25.21,00:19:25.21,more than we could understand him.
297,00:19:27.75,00:19:27.75,He had to kind of use his hands a lot.
298,00:19:30.04,00:19:30.04,Eventually we got it. >> Face is right there.
299,00:19:33.12,00:19:33.12,">> Eyes, nose. >> Look at that."
300,00:19:41.29,00:19:41.29,"All right. >> Da, he's just amazing."
301,00:19:45.21,00:19:45.21,"We're all in awe, I mean just watching... taking in the"
302,00:19:48.29,00:19:48.29,knowledge that he's giving us and he's cooking us a great
303,00:19:51.54,00:19:51.54,"dinner. It's a godsend, it's a blessing,"
304,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,it really is. >> Da was like a big breath
305,00:20:00.17,00:20:00.17,of fresh air. He really took our focus off
306,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,each other and focused more on what's going on around us.
307,00:20:07.00,00:20:07.00,"I definitely feel more confident that I can find food by myself,"
308,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,I could cook it by myself and I think he really boosted team
309,00:20:13.54,00:20:13.54,morale that we all have that confidence and that's huge.
310,00:20:30.38,00:20:30.38,>> Bubba getting tired of plantains.
311,00:20:32.83,00:20:32.83,>> Yeah. >> I bet old Da could have told
312,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,a few more things to eat. >> I bet they will
313,00:20:38.00,00:20:38.00,have a hell of a meal tonight. >> Today's reward
314,00:20:41.08,00:20:41.08,challenge would have really been fabulous because every creature
315,00:20:44.83,00:20:44.83,comfort we could have come up with could have been at our
316,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,fingertips right there. >> I'm fixing to go
317,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,through withdrawal. >> What?
318,00:20:54.25,00:20:54.25,>> Food. >> Camp morale at this
319,00:20:56.46,00:20:56.46,point is low. Bubba for one is not liking this
320,00:20:58.54,00:20:58.54,"day-to-day plantain thing, he's just not into it and it's"
321,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,really affecting his mood. >> I'm going to start
322,00:21:07.08,00:21:07.08,carving my wife's and children's name on my pole.
323,00:21:13.04,00:21:13.04,I'm from the country. Every meal was a celebration.
324,00:21:18.00,00:21:18.00,"You know, you eat with your family."
325,00:21:21.00,00:21:21.00,My biggest concern is how my family is doing.
326,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,"You know, are they missing Dad? You know they are, but my boys"
327,00:21:37.08,00:21:37.08,are my life. They are everything.
328,00:21:53.67,00:21:53.67,">> I'm worried about Trav. >> The thing is, he'll"
329,00:21:57.21,00:21:57.21,"just let his thoughts get the best of him, you know?"
330,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,>> It's becoming obvious that Bubba's weakness is
331,00:22:03.62,00:22:03.62,definitely his family. I'm just telling you
332,00:22:06.33,00:22:06.33,personally it's going to really affect you physically if you
333,00:22:10.21,00:22:10.21,"don't put that ... behind you. It's a weakness, man."
334,00:22:13.62,00:22:13.62,People start to question whether or not you're tripping.
335,00:22:17.29,00:22:17.29,That's going to affect people's perceptions of you.
336,00:22:20.46,00:22:20.46,>> Like I'm trying to be a loner.
337,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"All right, hey, appreciate it. >> Okay."
338,00:22:26.54,00:22:26.54,">> The thing with Rory is, a lot of times I think he's"
339,00:22:29.42,00:22:29.42,"really misunderstood. >> Whoa, man, we don't want"
340,00:22:32.33,00:22:32.33,dirt all over it. >> There was already dirt
341,00:22:34.96,00:22:34.96,all over it. >> Everybody's got
342,00:22:37.46,00:22:37.46,strong personalities here and Rory is no exception.
343,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,">>  Man, don't use clean water cleaning our food."
344,00:22:42.08,00:22:42.08,">> Sarge, you are so difficult to keep happy, man."
345,00:22:45.54,00:22:45.54,">> With Sarge and Rory, it's just an ongoing barrage of"
346,00:22:48.62,00:22:48.62,bickering. >> All the canteens have to
347,00:22:50.42,00:22:50.42,"be done in a line, too. >> Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
348,00:22:53.29,00:22:53.29,>> Whether it's this filling the canteens full of
349,00:22:55.38,00:22:55.38,"water, how much wood to put on the fire, how to cook something,"
350,00:22:58.12,00:22:58.12,it's a lot of bickering and I'm tired of it.
351,00:23:00.58,00:23:00.58,>> You could have handed it to me.
352,00:23:02.62,00:23:02.62,">> There's always rocks on it. >> Okay, okay, okay."
353,00:23:04.58,00:23:04.58,">> Damn. >> I'm just saying, you"
354,00:23:06.25,00:23:06.25,don't have to throw at me like a bone.
355,00:23:08.50,00:23:08.50,">> All right, play nicely or you're both going to"
356,00:23:10.71,00:23:10.71,time out. Right now we just need
357,00:23:12.62,00:23:12.62,harmony on the team and today that definitely wasn't
358,00:23:14.96,00:23:14.96,happening. >> Right now Da is making
359,00:23:26.92,00:23:26.92,our beds comfortable. >> The man took bamboo and kept
360,00:23:32.46,00:23:32.46,chopping and chopping and chopping and then split it open
361,00:23:35.12,00:23:35.12,and flattened it out and all those humpity-bumpity bumps we
362,00:23:38.75,00:23:38.75,had in the bed-- they're gone. >> It's like a mattress.
363,00:23:43.21,00:23:43.21,This is going to be so good. Thank you.
364,00:23:48.46,00:23:48.46,Okay. Fishing.
365,00:23:50.92,00:23:50.92,>> Fishing? >> Fishing.
366,00:23:53.75,00:23:53.75,">> Okay. >> That night, Da made"
367,00:24:01.92,00:24:01.92,"torches out of dry palmetto, lit them up and we took off down"
368,00:24:05.25,00:24:05.25,the beach crab hunting. He was good to do anything that
369,00:24:11.42,00:24:11.42,we asked and I thought it was just extremely gracious of him.
370,00:24:15.25,00:24:15.25,>> (speaking native language) >> Not a good night to try?
371,00:24:19.58,00:24:19.58,There were no crabs. He said the tide needed to be
372,00:24:23.25,00:24:23.25,"further out, but to find ways that we can learn from each"
373,00:24:26.38,00:24:26.38,"other and speak to each other and cross cultures, it was"
374,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,touching to have an example of that happening in this exotic
375,00:24:32.62,00:24:32.62,place. >> It was a good day.
376,00:24:36.46,00:24:36.46,"I think a lot of feelings were healed, and I think our tribe"
377,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,kind of came back together. It was just a very wonderful
378,00:24:42.54,00:24:42.54,day for everybody. >> What did he get?
379,00:24:48.83,00:24:48.83,">> It looks like a crab. >> Oh, wow, a crab."

382,00:24:59.79,00:24:59.79,was surprised how emotionally attached we all got to Da just
383,00:25:02.54,00:25:02.54,"within 24 hours. We were all like, you know,"
384,00:25:06.21,00:25:06.21,practically crying when he left.
385,00:25:08.21,00:25:08.21,">> Thanks, Da. >> Bye."

394,00:25:44.38,00:25:44.38,"reward, huh? >> Yes."
395,00:25:47.08,00:25:47.08,>> This was the best reward we could have won.
396,00:25:49.88,00:25:49.88,"It was a morale booster, and, oh, my God, it couldn't have"
397,00:25:52.79,00:25:52.79,"come at a better time, because next time we have to go to"
398,00:25:55.62,00:25:55.62,challenge we'll be ready in a big way.
399,00:26:13.38,00:26:13.38,>> I have absolutely no idea how to use a Hawaiian sling.
400,00:26:18.04,00:26:18.04,"I know the concept, but I don't have any aim, any direction,"
401,00:26:23.12,00:26:23.12,but it's the first day. We'll see how it goes.
402,00:26:25.92,00:26:25.92,>> You going fishing? >> Yeah.
403,00:26:28.67,00:26:28.67,>> Just be really careful you don't break a point.
404,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,Rory took the spear and just milled around for hours today.
405,00:26:39.46,00:26:39.46,I've been trying to figure out a way for the last few days
406,00:26:42.50,00:26:42.50,here for a little bit of a rift between Sarge and Rory.
407,00:26:45.50,00:26:45.50,I think it's doable because I think the Sarge gets put off by
408,00:26:48.04,00:26:48.04,"him a little bit, too. Look at that."
409,00:26:50.83,00:26:50.83,He takes off with the spear so he can walk around and have fun
410,00:26:53.79,00:26:53.79,poking through the reef. >> Looking for sea shells
411,00:26:57.25,00:26:57.25,for his little kids? >> That's not helping
412,00:26:59.29,00:26:59.29,get us dinner at all. He's never going to put any
413,00:27:01.79,00:27:01.79,fish in this fire. It's never going to happen.
414,00:27:04.83,00:27:04.83,I was maybe a little bit sharper with the tongue today.
415,00:27:08.67,00:27:08.67,I was trying to just shake things up just a little bit and
416,00:27:11.92,00:27:11.92,figure out if there's any room to go one way or the other.
417,00:27:15.58,00:27:15.58,Who do you think is going to consider Rory a threat?
418,00:27:18.29,00:27:18.29,>> Nobody. >> Exactly.
419,00:27:21.04,00:27:21.04,So who is going to vote against Rory?
420,00:27:23.96,00:27:23.96,Nobody. He's not going to have anybody
421,00:27:26.04,00:27:26.04,vote against him so who do you think is going to be there in
422,00:27:28.33,00:27:28.33,the end? I planted my seed.
423,00:27:31.00,00:27:31.00,I did what I thought I could do.
424,00:27:33.58,00:27:33.58,I think our efforts should be on doing better as a tribe and
425,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,winning. Maybe if we start strengthening
426,00:27:38.79,00:27:38.79,"our tribe instead of making it weaker, things will improve."
427,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,>> Tree mail. >> Cool.

435,00:28:12.21,00:28:12.21,Council so we both feel very vulnerable and feel like this

437,00:28:32.17,00:28:32.17,"All right, Let's get to today's challenge."
438,00:28:35.08,00:28:35.08,We're at an interesting point in the game.
439,00:28:36.79,00:28:36.79,"We're still even, seven members each in a game that is all"
440,00:28:40.00,00:28:40.00,about numbers. This is what guarantees you the
441,00:28:42.21,00:28:42.21,numbers. Let me explain the challenge.
442,00:28:44.46,00:28:44.46,Both tribes are going to solve a tile puzzle.
443,00:28:47.71,00:28:47.71,"There are four Vanuatu symbols, each symbol in four different"
444,00:28:52.17,00:28:52.17,colors for a total of 16 tiles. Arrange the tiles so that none
445,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,"of the same symbols, none of the same colors are in the same"
446,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,row or same column. You'll select up person to be
447,00:29:03.75,00:29:03.75,your eyes. They will have a vantage point
448,00:29:06.12,00:29:06.12,above on a tower. First tribe to complete the
449,00:29:08.46,00:29:08.46,puzzle correctly wins immunity. Losers going to Tribal Council

460,00:29:40.25,00:29:40.25,different colors. Cannot have the same symbol or

521,00:32:44.96,00:32:44.96,Guaranteed at least one more day out here.
522,00:32:47.25,00:32:47.25,"Lopevi, never good to go to Tribal Council."
523,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,Somebody is going home tonight. You have the afternoon to
524,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,figure out who that is going to be.
525,00:32:55.21,00:32:55.21,Go back to camp and see you at Tribal.
526,00:33:22.50,00:33:22.50,>> The challenge today for immunity was pretty much
527,00:33:24.58,00:33:24.58,pandemonium. It was a mess.
528,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,We didn't even come close. >> There was just people
529,00:33:29.71,00:33:29.71,"screaming orders, and it was just a cluster."
530,00:33:33.25,00:33:33.25,">> And we all had our plan, but we said Rory would do the"
531,00:33:35.29,00:33:35.29,talking and that's what messed us up.

533,00:33:39.08,00:33:39.08,want to interfere with Rory. >> Most of us were
534,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,"sitting around most of the time, not saying anything, waiting for"
535,00:33:43.21,00:33:43.21,direction. >> It was the worst
536,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,performance as a team unit that we've had and I pretty much take
537,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,that on my shoulders. >> It didn't really
538,00:33:54.08,00:33:54.08,matter who was on the podium. We had people screaming orders
539,00:33:56.25,00:33:56.25,and nobody was listening to nobody.
540,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,>> There's a lot of yelling going on.
541,00:33:59.79,00:33:59.79,"If you looked up, Rory just sitting looking with a blank"
542,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,stare like he couldn't figure it out.
543,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,>> So is the reason Rory still in because he's not
544,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,seen as a threat. >> No. He's supposed to
545,00:34:10.54,00:34:10.54,be real good at puzzles. >> He didn't do better
546,00:34:13.71,00:34:13.71,than anyone else today. >> I know.
547,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,Maybe he just had a bad day. What if they vote for Brady
548,00:34:19.58,00:34:19.58,tonight. Would you vote that way?
549,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,Maybe it will show people that you're willing to work
550,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,with us. You see what I'm saying?
551,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,">> The way I look at it, bro, what does your group"
552,00:34:29.46,00:34:29.46,have to offer that's going to beat those girls?
553,00:34:32.00,00:34:32.00,Me and Brady are more athletic than anyone here.
554,00:34:34.17,00:34:34.17,You really think you guys are going to win some immunity
555,00:34:36.08,00:34:36.08,challenges? >> Let me ask you something.
556,00:34:39.88,00:34:39.88,"This little alliance we have going on, who do you think is"
557,00:34:43.46,00:34:43.46,the leader? >> You. Sarge?
558,00:34:49.21,00:34:49.21,">> He's called every shot. >> Man, I hope the five of"
559,00:34:53.71,00:34:53.71,us really are together because if not I'm dead right now.
560,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,If anybody turned around in our alliance and went
561,00:35:01.04,00:35:01.04,"against me it would be Sarge, and it really scares the hell"
562,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,out of me. Sarge just likes to dictate
563,00:35:06.04,00:35:06.04,what goes on. I don't know if you've noticed
564,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,"that or not. >> Yeah, I've noticed."
565,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,It's hard to miss. Within our alliance we do
566,00:35:14.04,00:35:14.04,have some conflict. Sarge could at the last second
567,00:35:18.04,00:35:18.04,make a change. Sarge does like to be in
568,00:35:21.54,00:35:21.54,control. >> Pull yourself up.
569,00:35:26.58,00:35:26.58,"If Brady gets voted out, okay, I'm going to lose a real good"
570,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"work partner. There you go, get up there,"
571,00:35:32.50,00:35:32.50,get up there. There you go. I would keep him here to the
572,00:35:35.04,00:35:35.04,end because he's one of the strongest.
573,00:35:38.12,00:35:38.12,Don't let that son of a bitch win.
574,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,My background tells me have the strongest warriors with you
575,00:35:45.04,00:35:45.04,"when you go to a battle. There you go, all right, all"
576,00:35:47.46,00:35:47.46,right. The pack wants Brady gone
577,00:35:49.71,00:35:49.71,but Rory is a bad seed and you don't need bad seeds on a team
578,00:35:53.04,00:35:53.04,when you're fighting for survival.
579,00:35:56.38,00:35:56.38,"Hey, we'll see what happens. >> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal"
580,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,Council. Before we get to the vote let's
581,00:36:24.54,00:36:24.54,"talk about today's challenge. Rory, you got zero respect"
582,00:36:27.21,00:36:27.21,today. How does it make you feel?
583,00:36:29.79,00:36:29.79,"Every Tribal we've come to, you've gotten votes."
584,00:36:32.67,00:36:32.67,"Then today you're leading the tribe, which is odd to me, and"
585,00:36:36.71,00:36:36.71,"then even weirder, nobody listens."
586,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,">> I am the leading vote- getter at this point, Jeff, and"
587,00:36:43.08,00:36:43.08,"I'm scared as hell right now, as a matter of fact."
588,00:36:46.29,00:36:46.29,>> PROBST: The last two days have seen a huge shift in
589,00:36:49.38,00:36:49.38,"momentum, with the women clearly in control."
590,00:36:52.88,00:36:52.88,They win the reward challenge improve their camp life
591,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,dramatically. They win the immunity challenge
592,00:36:57.38,00:36:57.38,today and force you guys to vote out yet another member.
593,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"Bubba, can you guys sense that shift happening?"
594,00:37:02.92,00:37:02.92,">> Yeah, Jeff, they really kicked us in the groin today."
595,00:37:06.08,00:37:06.08,"We really took it hard, but the thing of it is I really think"
596,00:37:09.33,00:37:09.33,"that we're going to be a whole new ball team come next game, I"
597,00:37:12.96,00:37:12.96,"really do, Jeff, I really believe that."
598,00:37:15.50,00:37:15.50,">> PROBST: Based on what I'm looking at, I don't buy it at"
599,00:37:18.38,00:37:18.38,"all. Brady, do you think it's"
600,00:37:20.75,00:37:20.75,possible that you guys started playing an individual game way
601,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,"too soon? >> I think at the very,"
602,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,"very beginning, day one, maybe even hour one, individuals"
603,00:37:29.04,00:37:29.04,"started thinking about where they were going to be six, eight"
604,00:37:32.88,00:37:32.88,"challenges down the road, and I think that mindset took apart a"
605,00:37:36.92,00:37:36.92,lot of our team concept right from the very beginning.
606,00:37:40.38,00:37:40.38,">> PROBST: Chris, the obvious problem with playing an"
607,00:37:42.25,00:37:42.25,"individual game you is may last longer than the guy next to you,"
608,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,but you're not going to last longer than the women.
609,00:37:47.38,00:37:47.38,">> Yeah, but you don't necessarily know where the women"
610,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,are coming from. You don't necessarily know if
611,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,the women are going to be playing numbers or how are the
612,00:37:53.46,00:37:53.46,women playing? We don't know how they are
613,00:37:56.29,00:37:56.29,playing. >> PROBST: What on Earth would
614,00:37:58.21,00:37:58.21,make you think they're going to do anything but stick
615,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,together? >> There's nothing that
616,00:38:01.88,00:38:01.88,makes me think they wouldn't stick together.
617,00:38:03.96,00:38:03.96,"But I'm just saying, look, you're a team at first, you're a"
618,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,"tribe, you have to no choice, but the bottom line is looking"
619,00:38:08.46,00:38:08.46,"ahead individually, you've got to make sure you do what's right"
620,00:38:12.50,00:38:12.50,"for you. I mean, anything can happen."
621,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,">> PROBST: Chad, as Chris was saying that, you were shaking"
622,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,your head in agreement. >> If things within the
623,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,tribe starts happening where there's a sense that people are
624,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,"starting to go individual, what are you going to do as an"
625,00:38:23.92,00:38:23.92,"individual if you feel that that is starting to happen, you have"
626,00:38:26.54,00:38:26.54,to jump on. Ideally the tribe will come
627,00:38:29.33,00:38:29.33,"first, but this individual thing has to be your backup plan."
628,00:38:32.33,00:38:32.33,It's the only way to save your own butt.
629,00:38:34.79,00:38:34.79,">> PROBST: John, are you concerned tonight you might be"
630,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,going home? >> I'm extremely worried.
631,00:38:39.08,00:38:39.08,The past two guys that were voted out were two of the more
632,00:38:41.71,00:38:41.71,"athletic guys in our group so, yeah, I'm scared."
633,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"I mean, There's not much more I can do."
634,00:38:46.04,00:38:46.04,I'm not going to back down and pretend I'm not a good athlete.
635,00:38:48.62,00:38:48.62,">> PROBST: Brady, why are you voting the way you're voting"
636,00:38:51.25,00:38:51.25,tonight? >> I'm voting first and
637,00:38:53.25,00:38:53.25,foremost to make sure our team doesn't lag behind the other
638,00:38:56.12,00:38:56.12,team. I want this team to stop that
639,00:38:59.00,00:38:59.00,"momentum slide, turn it around and go into the merge with some"
640,00:39:01.54,00:39:01.54,"momentum, that's the way I'm voting."
641,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,">> PROBST: With that, it's time to vote."
642,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,"Chris, you're up. >> Brady, you caught the"
643,00:39:25.25,00:39:25.25,"first fish, you even climbed the pole, but the spirits sometimes"
644,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,dictate that it's time for you to go.
645,00:39:39.88,00:39:39.88,>> Maybe the third time's the charm.
646,00:40:05.21,00:40:05.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
647,00:40:21.71,00:40:21.71,Once the votes are read the decision is final.
648,00:40:23.75,00:40:23.75,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
649,00:40:26.08,00:40:26.08,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
650,00:40:29.08,00:40:29.08,First vote... Brady.
651,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,Brady. Two votes Brady.
652,00:40:40.12,00:40:40.12,"Rory. Two votes Brady, one vote Rory."
653,00:40:46.83,00:40:46.83,Three votes Brady. The fifth person voted out of
654,00:40:55.62,00:40:55.62,"Survivor Vanuatu, Brady. That's four votes, that's"
655,00:40:58.92,00:40:58.92,enough. Please bring me your torch.
656,00:41:10.21,00:41:10.21,"Brady, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
657,00:41:16.04,00:41:16.04,">> Good luck, fellas. >> PROBST: Well, based on your"
658,00:41:25.00,00:41:25.00,"first three Tribal Councils, it would appear that you're voting"
659,00:41:27.79,00:41:27.79,out tribe members that you think might become an
660,00:41:30.38,00:41:30.38,individual threat later in the game.
661,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,Only potential problem with that strategy-- it's still early
662,00:41:35.12,00:41:35.12,in the game. See how it plays out.
663,00:41:37.17,00:41:37.17,Grab your torches and go back to camp.
664,00:41:53.71,00:41:53.71,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
665,00:41:57.54,00:41:57.54,Next time on Survivor: >> There are people
666,00:42:00.12,00:42:00.12,coming in on a canoe. >> Are you serious?
667,00:42:01.88,00:42:01.88,>> I'm dead serious. >> PROBST: Lopevi and Yasur
668,00:42:04.17,00:42:04.17,"face a shakeup. All right, everybody,"
669,00:42:06.04,00:42:06.04,drop your buffs. And then...
670,00:42:09.46,00:42:09.46,">> Holy ... >> Oh, my gosh."
671,00:42:13.04,00:42:13.04,>> Whoa! You feel that earthquake?
