55,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,>> I told you that.>> That was before I thought
56,00:03:54.25,00:03:54.25,that there was somebody who wasgoing to flip.
57,00:03:56.33,00:03:56.33,I'm sorry I everapologized almost.

59,00:04:01.71,00:04:01.71,It is what it is.>> The vote at Tribal Council
60,00:04:06.04,00:04:06.04,shocked the hell out of me.Lisa was supposedly in an
61,00:04:09.67,00:04:09.67,"alliance with me, Julie and Mia,so when she voted against Mia,"
62,00:04:14.46,00:04:14.46,"that totally blindsided me andI was like, ""That bitch."""

68,00:04:33.88,00:04:33.88,"Finally, she forgave me and thenshe did the exact same thing."
69,00:04:36.88,00:04:36.88,That makes you seem like kind ofa hypocrite.
70,00:04:39.42,00:04:39.42,">> You know what, I hada right and I changed my mind."
71,00:04:41.38,00:04:41.38,I'm not going to beconfrontational.

79,00:04:59.12,00:04:59.12,talk to you tomorrow.>> I just want us all to
80,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,"become a strong team.If we want to beat these guys,"
81,00:05:04.79,00:05:04.79,we need to be tough and we needstrong inner and outer.
82,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,"I don't know how to get there,but we need to get there and"
83,00:05:10.46,00:05:10.46,I'm going to sleep because I'mtired.
84,00:05:12.96,00:05:12.96,>> I wasn't surprisedabout Eliza or Julie getting mad

87,00:05:24.21,00:05:24.21,"alliance with the older group.>> Guys, I'm going to have to"
88,00:05:27.54,00:05:27.54,switch with somebody.>> I'm furious.
89,00:05:30.08,00:05:30.08,"I do not trust Lisa, not onebit."
90,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,I'm going to be civil to her andand pretend to be unified
91,00:05:35.88,00:05:35.88,"because that's what everybodywants, but if she were gone"
92,00:05:38.54,00:05:38.54,tomorrow I would be thrilled.She repulses me now.
93,00:05:59.96,00:05:59.96,">> That was hairy for melast night, getting three votes."
94,00:06:02.21,00:06:02.21,>> It's a gut check.>> Getting those three votes.
95,00:06:04.75,00:06:04.75,"I took three votes lastnight in Tribal Council, and"
96,00:06:09.12,00:06:09.12,yet that doesn't really botherme a whole lot.
97,00:06:13.83,00:06:13.83,>> Our five strong isinvincible.
98,00:06:16.46,00:06:16.46,We need to stay the course andwe have no worries.
99,00:06:18.62,00:06:18.62,"It's all about the numbers,baby."
100,00:06:20.42,00:06:20.42,">> The fact of the matteris, I've got an agreement with"
101,00:06:22.58,00:06:22.58,"Chad, Travis, Sarge and Chris.That's already a numbers game"
102,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,that works for me.>> I can't stand the
103,00:06:37.71,00:06:37.71,way that this tribe ended up.The good young guys that have
104,00:06:41.00,00:06:41.00,great personalities and aregood athletes are all gone.
105,00:06:44.46,00:06:44.46,Why are we letting fat dudesrun the show?
106,00:06:48.75,00:06:48.75,This doesn't make any sense tome.
107,00:06:51.21,00:06:51.21,I don't know what these guysare doing.
108,00:06:53.54,00:06:53.54,>> Yeah.Setting us up for losing
109,00:06:55.25,00:06:55.25,challenges and such.>> I don't blame Rory for doing
110,00:06:58.88,00:06:58.88,"it, but Bubba and Chad.>> Just because it's easy"
111,00:07:02.25,00:07:02.25,and a sure thing.It's an easy numbers game right
112,00:07:05.04,00:07:05.04,now.They don't have to think very
113,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,far down the road.I don't know why they think
114,00:07:10.04,00:07:10.04,"their plan will work.None of them are very athletic,"
115,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,and the bottom line is a lot ofthese challenges are physical
116,00:07:16.25,00:07:16.25,"so we'll see what happens.>> The fab five, as long"
117,00:07:26.96,00:07:26.96,"as they got their five, whichthey have had since day one"
118,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,there's not much left up in theair.
119,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,The only thing I can physicallydo myself I think is the
120,00:07:35.12,00:07:35.12,fishing.If I can endear myself enough
121,00:07:39.50,00:07:39.50,"with the fishing, that maychange one or two people's"
122,00:07:42.83,00:07:42.83,minds.Wish me luck.
123,00:07:45.71,00:07:45.71,>> Good luck.>> Good luck.
124,00:08:02.04,00:08:02.04,Got one already.>> Yeah.
125,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,I got him.Give it a chance to grow up.
126,00:08:14.17,00:08:14.17,>> I got little fish andits brother littler.
127,00:08:17.46,00:08:17.46,The seem like the only fishdumb enough to get hit by the
128,00:08:19.46,00:08:19.46,"spear are the small ones.>> Good job, brother!"
129,00:08:23.46,00:08:23.46,I wouldn't shoot somethingthat small because that
130,00:08:27.04,00:08:27.04,wouldn't even fill one person.>> You know what if they
131,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,"are offering themselves up tome, we can at least throw them"
132,00:08:33.92,00:08:33.92,"in there.John and I, it's getting"
133,00:08:36.75,00:08:36.75,down to the nitty-gritty.Hopefully we'll figure out a
134,00:08:40.12,00:08:40.12,way to shake up the game andchange the dynamics of what's
135,00:08:43.21,00:08:43.21,going on right now becausesomething's got to happen.
