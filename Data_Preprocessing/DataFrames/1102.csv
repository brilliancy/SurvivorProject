63,00:04:25.67,00:04:25.67,to suffer the emotional hit-- the physical hit is bad enough.
64,00:04:31.38,00:04:31.38,The emotional toll that Tribal Council takes on you is
65,00:04:34.54,00:04:34.54,"terrible. It's just a sick, sick feeling"

79,00:05:43.42,00:05:43.42,"together and it's brilliant. >> Are you guys cold, or no?"
80,00:05:46.75,00:05:46.75,">> No, but a tarantula jumped on my arm."

85,00:05:58.00,00:05:58.00,"Nobody has asked me what I did 15 years ago, so I guess I don't"
86,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,have to tell them. >> All right.

93,00:06:24.75,00:06:24.75,before So I think the fact that we get
94,00:06:28.17,00:06:28.17,"along so well is huge, Cause we do have good team"
95,00:06:30.42,00:06:30.42,"morale. It's become like a family, and"
96,00:06:33.12,00:06:33.12,we're hoping to keep that family together for a long time.

378,00:23:07.88,00:23:07.88,"the rest of the football players, but, uh... ( laughs)"
379,00:23:11.38,00:23:11.38,"but he's been holding his own, so we'll see what happens."
380,00:23:26.12,00:23:26.12,>> JEFF: Okay. First things first.
381,00:23:28.58,00:23:28.58,"Lydia, give it up. Immunity back up for grabs."
382,00:23:36.54,00:23:36.54,Today's immunity challenge is a good old-fashioned tug-of-war.
383,00:23:40.42,00:23:40.42,Both tribes will be connected to each other with a common rope.
384,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,Your goal is to retrieve a tribe flag.
385,00:23:47.42,00:23:47.42,There's a rope anchored at each end of the field.
386,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,"If you get to it, use it to pull yourself to your flag."
387,00:23:54.00,00:23:54.00,"At any time, tribe members from either tribe can go back and try"
388,00:23:57.79,00:23:57.79,to interfere with the other tribe to impede their progress.
389,00:24:02.04,00:24:02.04,There is a time element to this challenge.
390,00:24:05.21,00:24:05.21,"If, after 15 minutes, neither tribe has retrieved a single"
391,00:24:08.00,00:24:08.00,"flag, we'll move to a series of one-on-one showdowns."
392,00:24:12.04,00:24:12.04,"The tribe that wins this challenge wins immunity,"
393,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,guaranteed at least one more day out here in hot Guatemala.
394,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,"Losers, Tribal Council tonight. Somebody going home."
395,00:24:22.79,00:24:22.79,"Yaxha, you have one extra member."
396,00:24:24.00,00:24:24.00,"Sitting somebody out. Amy sat out the last challenge,"
397,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,cannot sit out in this one. Brianna.
398,00:24:29.12,00:24:29.12,"All right. Everybody else, wait for my go."
399,00:24:35.71,00:24:35.71,Here we go. Survivors ready...
400,00:24:41.08,00:24:41.08,go! >> Come on.
401,00:24:48.71,00:24:48.71,">> JEFF: Nakum with a bit of a lead, right off the bat."
402,00:24:52.58,00:24:52.58,"Brian going back. >> Pull, pull, pull!"
403,00:25:00.17,00:25:00.17,>> JEFF: Danni and Brian having a little shove off.
404,00:25:03.04,00:25:03.04,>> Play hard! >> I'm playing hard!
405,00:25:05.04,00:25:05.04,>> Amy yelling at Brian to get into it.
406,00:25:08.08,00:25:08.08,"Danni, shoving him in the mud. >> Pull, pull."

411,00:25:29.25,00:25:29.25,Yaxha giving it everything they have and not doing anything.
412,00:25:37.29,00:25:37.29,Immunity at stake. Somebody going home tonight.
413,00:25:41.04,00:25:41.04,>> Pull. Just walk in.
414,00:25:45.29,00:25:45.29,Just walk in. ( groaning )
415,00:25:49.17,00:25:49.17,>> JEFF: Down to one minute left in this round.
416,00:25:52.25,00:25:52.25,If neither tribe has a flag in one minute we go to one-on-one.
417,00:25:57.25,00:25:57.25,"Nakum, takes a sudden surge. Get ahold of that rope and you"
418,00:26:03.33,00:26:03.33,"can pull yourselves in. Yaxha, not giving up an inch."
419,00:26:08.88,00:26:08.88,"We're winding this down. Five, four, three, two, one."
420,00:26:15.38,00:26:15.38,Time! Stop right there!
421,00:26:18.08,00:26:18.08,Got a stalemate. All right.
422,00:26:22.21,00:26:22.21,We're moving on to a series of one-on-one showdowns.
423,00:26:25.04,00:26:25.04,"At the end of each showdown, whichever tribe member is closer"
424,00:26:29.12,00:26:29.12,"to their flag, wins the flag. Three flags wins immunity."
425,00:26:34.17,00:26:34.17,Any tribe member can go as many rounds as they want.
426,00:26:37.08,00:26:37.08,Each round will last five minutes.
427,00:26:39.12,00:26:39.12,Figure out who is going first. Judd will go for Nakum.
428,00:26:43.96,00:26:43.96,Gary will be the one for Yaxha. Here we go.
429,00:26:47.00,00:26:47.00,"Challenge back on. >> Come on, Gary."

495,00:31:25.33,00:31:25.33,The thing about that is we've got to keep strength on our side
496,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,for those challenges so we win them.
497,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,>> They want to get rid of me? Has anybody said that?

506,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,"I guess it's just from inexperience on Jamie's part,"
507,00:31:56.50,00:31:56.50,"and I'm not saying I'm a pro, but this early, I mean, clearly"
508,00:32:00.21,00:32:00.21,I am the strongest girl on the team.
509,00:32:02.46,00:32:02.46,Why would they want to vote me off first?
510,00:32:04.79,00:32:04.79,That's retarded. I refuse to go early this time.
511,00:32:07.12,00:32:07.12,"I refuse. >> Gary, were you a former"

517,00:32:38.83,00:32:38.83,"you that. I said, how do you know, and"
518,00:32:40.58,00:32:40.58,"she says ""Oh, I'm a sportscaster, so I know him from"
519,00:32:43.21,00:32:43.21,then. >> It was brought up by Danni

521,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,Brian that as they were wrestling in the mud.
522,00:32:54.79,00:32:54.79,What the heck she was doing telling him that while she was

524,00:33:00.04,00:33:00.04,"tribe, I'll bet. >> That's pretty funny."
525,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,">> Yeah, well, Danni is a sportscaster."
526,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,>> Somebody needs to knock her out.
527,00:33:06.08,00:33:06.08,>> GARY: I'm just going to deny and see how it goes.
528,00:33:11.12,00:33:11.12,"I'll play it by ear, because I think I'd be voted off"
529,00:33:13.71,00:33:13.71,immediately. >> Everybody is going around--
530,00:33:40.08,00:33:40.08,What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?
531,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,The two that I'm thinking about are Lydia and Morgan.
532,00:33:45.12,00:33:45.12,Lydia is limited in the challenges compared to Morgan.
533,00:33:49.29,00:33:49.29,But Morgan doesn't do very much in camp.
534,00:33:52.96,00:33:52.96,">> Morgan or Lydia. >> It's got to be Morgan, I"
535,00:33:55.71,00:33:55.71,think. >> But Morgan in an obstacle
536,00:33:58.04,00:33:58.04,course is much quicker. I love Lydia.
537,00:34:00.46,00:34:00.46,"I'm only saying Lydia because I love her, but Morgan is much"
538,00:34:03.38,00:34:03.38,"more athletic. >> All right, longevity-wise"
539,00:34:05.62,00:34:05.62,who do you think will be better? ...to get us to...
540,00:34:08.29,00:34:08.29,">> Morgan, we can pick up like Lydia's doing."
541,00:34:11.46,00:34:11.46,We can catch fish. >> We can pick up what Lydia is
542,00:34:15.08,00:34:15.08,"doing. >> I know she's lazy, but"
543,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,we need some big challengers. >> Okay.
544,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,>> So we have a decision? >> Lydia.
545,00:34:21.79,00:34:21.79,">> Well, I mean, is that what everyone..."

547,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,"Lydia, but, yeah, it has to be. >> One of the things that you"
548,00:34:29.42,00:34:29.42,"can't do in this game is get emotional, so, from now till"
549,00:34:32.46,00:34:32.46,"Tribal Council, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of"
550,00:34:35.25,00:34:35.25,thinking going on. >> Lydia's name came up because
551,00:35:06.29,00:35:06.29,they think she's weaker because she's older.
552,00:35:08.17,00:35:08.17,She's pulled her weight in challenges.
553,00:35:10.08,00:35:10.08,She walked 11 miles with everybody else.
554,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,"The woman can do the work. I told her, I said, ""Lydia, it's"
555,00:35:15.17,00:35:15.17,"not looking good for you."" Because she needs to know."
556,00:35:27.21,00:35:27.21,">> Well, what's going on in camp right now is not in my favor at"
557,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"all. I mean, I know my head is on the"

559,00:35:38.08,00:35:38.08,Sounds like I'm going home. I just don't think it's right.
560,00:35:42.58,00:35:42.58,"I put my heart and soul into every single challenge, and I"
561,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,"endeavored every single one of them, you know?"
562,00:35:49.88,00:35:49.88,"So am I safe with you? Because, you know, whatever you"
563,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,"guys want to do, I'll be there for you."
564,00:36:04.88,00:36:04.88,">> I know that. >> I'm not ready to go, Gary."
565,00:36:14.75,00:36:14.75,>> The main thing is that our tribe votes somehow unified.
566,00:36:18.75,00:36:18.75,We don't want to have some crazy vote that no one expected and
567,00:36:23.25,00:36:23.25,then us all be fractured at camp and stuff.
568,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,The fact that we're going to Tribal Council tonight sucks so
569,00:36:29.50,00:36:29.50,"badly, but the hard reality of the game is that that's what"
570,00:36:32.38,00:36:32.38,happens. >> JEFF: Behind each of you is a
571,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and
572,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,approach a flame. Dip it in and get fire.
573,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because in this
574,00:37:14.79,00:37:14.79,game fire represents your life. As long as you have fire you're
575,00:37:19.21,00:37:19.21,"still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are"
576,00:37:21.29,00:37:21.29,you. So catch me up on the status of
577,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"this tribe. Steph, what was the reaction"
578,00:37:28.17,00:37:28.17,with you coming into this game having already played it?
579,00:37:30.92,00:37:30.92,>> Actually they were really welcoming.
580,00:37:32.58,00:37:32.58,I thought there might be a few negative reactions.
581,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,"I mean, I'm not an idiot. They know that I played this"
582,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,game. I know how the game works.
583,00:37:40.04,00:37:40.04,"But, um, we're one tribe and it's important just to win"
584,00:37:43.04,00:37:43.04,"immunity and I feel that way and I hope they feel that way, but"
585,00:37:47.00,00:37:47.00,this game is a big bunch of lies half the time.
586,00:37:49.79,00:37:49.79,">> JEFF: Jamie, what's the problem with having somebody"
587,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,like Steph out here? >> She knows the game really
588,00:37:55.79,00:37:55.79,well. She's always going to be a
589,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,"threat, and she's tough. She's not like a girl."
590,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,She's more like a boy. >> JEFF: Who here of the women
591,00:38:04.12,00:38:04.12,doesn't play like a guy? >> None of them play at the
592,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,"level Stephenie does, I don't think, in my opinion."
593,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,">> JEFF: Lydia, just looking at you from the outside, you"
594,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,could say maybe you're the least equipped for this game.
595,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,It must run through your head a little bit on this tribe if I'm
596,00:38:18.04,00:38:18.04,"the least athletic, I could be the first to go."
597,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,">> Actually it is, Jeff. Sometimes, you know, you just"
598,00:38:24.58,00:38:24.58,feel like deep down inside are they really feeling that I can
599,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,"endure this? I think I've shown them, you"
600,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"know, that I'm a person that would never give up."
601,00:38:33.38,00:38:33.38,">> JEFF: Morgan, the vibe I'm getting from you guys is this"
602,00:38:37.25,00:38:37.25,"really is one unified group, but somebody is going home"
603,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,tonight. It's like it's an unspoken thing
604,00:38:42.29,00:38:42.29,that nobody is talking about. What's your take on that?
605,00:38:46.08,00:38:46.08,>> I think that our tribe is very unified because we've been
606,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,honest with each other up to this point and so I think that
607,00:38:52.46,00:38:52.46,it's not an unspoken thing. I think we all kind of know
608,00:38:56.00,00:38:56.00,"what's going on, but somebody has to go and I don't want to"
609,00:38:59.67,00:38:59.67,"say good-bye to anyone yet. >> JEFF: Rafe, what are you"
610,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,gonna base your vote on? >> Tonight I'm basing my vote on
611,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,"keeping this tribe unified. You know, we have grown to"
612,00:39:09.46,00:39:09.46,become something like a family out here and going home tonight
613,00:39:13.21,00:39:13.21,without one of our members is going to be a crushing blow that
614,00:39:16.17,00:39:16.17,"hopefully we can move on from, and I truly believe that we can."
615,00:39:20.00,00:39:20.00,">> JEFF: Okay, it is time to vote."
616,00:39:21.58,00:39:21.58,"Amy, you're up. >> I hope to high heaven this"
617,00:39:37.08,00:39:37.08,works. I scrambled at the last minute.
618,00:39:52.29,00:39:52.29,">> Believe it or not, Lydia. This is going to be one of the"
619,00:39:54.88,00:39:54.88,hardest decisions that I make while I'm out here.
620,00:40:09.50,00:40:09.50,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
621,00:40:21.88,00:40:21.88,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
622,00:40:24.54,00:40:24.54,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
623,00:40:26.50,00:40:26.50,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
624,00:40:30.42,00:40:30.42,"First vote, Morgan. Lydia."
625,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,"One vote Lydia, one vote Morgan. Morgan."
626,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,Two votes Morgan. One vote Lydia.
627,00:40:49.08,00:40:49.08,"Morgan. That's three votes Morgan, one"
628,00:40:51.62,00:40:51.62,vote Lydia. Morgan.
629,00:40:56.29,00:40:56.29,Four votes Morgan. One vote Lydia.
630,00:41:03.29,00:41:03.29,"Second person voted out of Survivor: Guatemala, Morgan."
631,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50,That's five. That's enough.
632,00:41:07.29,00:41:07.29,"You need to bring me your torch. Morgan, the tribe has spoken."
633,00:41:19.88,00:41:19.88,"It's time for you to go. Well, based on tonight's vote"
634,00:41:37.67,00:41:37.67,"I'm a little confused. On the one hand, I do believe"
635,00:41:40.46,00:41:40.46,you're unified and tonight was a tough vote.
636,00:41:42.75,00:41:42.75,"On the other hand, the person voted out never saw it coming."
637,00:41:45.21,00:41:45.21,Grab your torches and head on back to camp.
638,00:41:47.25,00:41:47.25,Good night. >> Stay tuned for scenes from
639,00:42:03.00,00:42:03.00,"our next episode. >> JEFF: Next time on Survivor,"
640,00:42:09.04,00:42:09.04,Nakum defies the crocodiles. >> Everybody watches each
641,00:42:11.42,00:42:11.42,"other's backs from these crocodiles, we'll be all right."
642,00:42:13.08,00:42:13.08,">> Even though we can't see them, there's probably hundreds"
643,00:42:16.00,00:42:16.00,in this lake. >> I've never felt more alive in
644,00:42:17.92,00:42:17.92,"my entire life. >> JEFF: And at Yaxha, Amy is in"
645,00:42:20.25,00:42:20.25,trouble. >> It's swollen.
646,00:42:21.38,00:42:21.38,">> Did you hear it snap? >> Oh, yeah, snapped both sides."
647,00:42:24.88,00:42:24.88,">> You'll have to stick needles in my eyeballs, I will not give"
648,00:42:27.04,00:42:27.04,"up. >> Wow, I just didn't really see"
649,00:42:35.04,00:42:35.04,"that one coming at all. I mean, I don't really know why"
650,00:42:39.08,00:42:39.08,I got voted off. I just feel really naive.
651,00:42:41.88,00:42:41.88,"Either way, it was such an amazing experience."
652,00:42:44.12,00:42:44.12,"You know, I got to live in Guatemala for almost a week and"
653,00:42:46.62,00:42:46.62,I've done a lot of things that I didn't think I
654,00:42:48.58,00:42:48.58,"could do, so the experience of it all was worth every second."
