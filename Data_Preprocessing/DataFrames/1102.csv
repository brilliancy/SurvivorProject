561,00:35:49.88,00:35:49.88,"So am I safe with you?Because, you know, whatever you"
562,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,"guys want to do, I'll be therefor you."
563,00:36:04.88,00:36:04.88,">> I know that.>> I'm not ready to go, Gary."
564,00:36:14.75,00:36:14.75,>> The main thing is that ourtribe votes somehow unified.
565,00:36:18.75,00:36:18.75,We don't want to have some crazyvote that no one expected and
566,00:36:23.25,00:36:23.25,then us all be fractured at campand stuff.
567,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,The fact that we're going toTribal Council tonight sucks so
568,00:36:29.50,00:36:29.50,"badly, but the hard reality ofthe game is that that's what"
569,00:36:32.38,00:36:32.38,happens.>> JEFF: Behind each of you is a
570,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,torch.Go ahead and grab a torch and
571,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,approach a flame.Dip it in and get fire.
572,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,This is part of the ritual ofTribal Council because in this
573,00:37:14.79,00:37:14.79,game fire represents your life.As long as you have fire you're
574,00:37:19.21,00:37:19.21,"still in the game.When your fire is gone, so are"
575,00:37:21.29,00:37:21.29,you.So catch me up on the status of
576,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"this tribe.Steph, what was the reaction"
577,00:37:28.17,00:37:28.17,with you coming into this gamehaving already played it?
578,00:37:30.92,00:37:30.92,>> Actually they were reallywelcoming.
579,00:37:32.58,00:37:32.58,I thought there might be a fewnegative reactions.
580,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,"I mean, I'm not an idiot.They know that I played this"
581,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,game.I know how the game works.
582,00:37:40.04,00:37:40.04,"But, um, we're one tribe andit's important just to win"
583,00:37:43.04,00:37:43.04,"immunity and I feel that way andI hope they feel that way, but"
584,00:37:47.00,00:37:47.00,this game is a big bunch of lieshalf the time.
585,00:37:49.79,00:37:49.79,">> JEFF: Jamie, what's theproblem with having somebody"
586,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,like Steph out here?>> She knows the game really
587,00:37:55.79,00:37:55.79,well.She's always going to be a
588,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,"threat, and she's tough.She's not like a girl."
589,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,She's more like a boy.>> JEFF: Who here of the women
590,00:38:04.12,00:38:04.12,doesn't play like a guy?>> None of them play at the
591,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,"level Stephenie does,I don't think, in my opinion."
592,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,">> JEFF: Lydia, just lookingat you from the outside, you"
593,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,could say maybe you're the leastequipped for this game.
594,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,It must run through your head alittle bit on this tribe if I'm
595,00:38:18.04,00:38:18.04,"the least athletic, I could bethe first to go."
596,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,">> Actually it is, Jeff.Sometimes, you know, you just"
597,00:38:24.58,00:38:24.58,feel like deep down inside arethey really feeling that I can
598,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,"endure this?I think I've shown them, you"
599,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"know, that I'm a person thatwould never give up."
600,00:38:33.38,00:38:33.38,">> JEFF: Morgan, the vibe I'mgetting from you guys is this"
601,00:38:37.25,00:38:37.25,"really is one unified group,but somebody is going home"
602,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,tonight.It's like it's an unspoken thing
603,00:38:42.29,00:38:42.29,that nobody is talking about.What's your take on that?
604,00:38:46.08,00:38:46.08,>> I think that our tribe isvery unified because we've been
605,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,honest with each other up tothis point and so I think that
606,00:38:52.46,00:38:52.46,it's not an unspoken thing.I think we all kind of know
607,00:38:56.00,00:38:56.00,"what's going on, but somebodyhas to go and I don't want to"
608,00:38:59.67,00:38:59.67,"say good-bye to anyone yet.>> JEFF: Rafe, what are you"
609,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,gonna base your vote on?>> Tonight I'm basing my vote on
610,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,"keeping this tribe unified.You know, we have grown to"
611,00:39:09.46,00:39:09.46,become something like a familyout here and going home tonight
612,00:39:13.21,00:39:13.21,without one of our members isgoing to be a crushing blow that
613,00:39:16.17,00:39:16.17,"hopefully we can move on from,and I truly believe that we can."
614,00:39:20.00,00:39:20.00,">> JEFF: Okay, it is time tovote."
615,00:39:21.58,00:39:21.58,"Amy, you're up.>> I hope to high heaven this"
616,00:39:37.08,00:39:37.08,works.I scrambled at the last minute.
617,00:39:52.29,00:39:52.29,">> Believe it or not, Lydia.This is going to be one of the"
618,00:39:54.88,00:39:54.88,hardest decisions that I makewhile I'm out here.
619,00:40:09.50,00:40:09.50,>> JEFF: I'll go tally thevotes.
620,00:40:21.88,00:40:21.88,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
621,00:40:24.54,00:40:24.54,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
622,00:40:26.50,00:40:26.50,Council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
623,00:40:30.42,00:40:30.42,"First vote, Morgan.Lydia."
624,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,"One vote Lydia, one vote Morgan.Morgan."
625,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,Two votes Morgan.One vote Lydia.
626,00:40:49.08,00:40:49.08,"Morgan.That's three votes Morgan, one"
627,00:40:51.62,00:40:51.62,vote Lydia.Morgan.
628,00:40:56.29,00:40:56.29,Four votes Morgan.One vote Lydia.
629,00:41:03.29,00:41:03.29,"Second person voted out ofSurvivor: Guatemala, Morgan."
630,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50,That's five.That's enough.
631,00:41:07.29,00:41:07.29,"You need to bring me your torch.Morgan, the tribe has spoken."
632,00:41:19.88,00:41:19.88,"It's time for you to go.Well, based on tonight's vote"
633,00:41:37.67,00:41:37.67,"I'm a little confused.On the one hand, I do believe"
634,00:41:40.46,00:41:40.46,you're unified and tonight was atough vote.
635,00:41:42.75,00:41:42.75,"On the other hand, the personvoted out never saw it coming."
636,00:41:45.21,00:41:45.21,Grab your torches and head onback to camp.
637,00:41:47.25,00:41:47.25,Good night.>> Stay tuned for scenes from
638,00:42:03.00,00:42:03.00,"our next episode.>> JEFF: Next time on Survivor,"
639,00:42:09.04,00:42:09.04,Nakum defies the crocodiles.>> Everybody watches each
640,00:42:11.42,00:42:11.42,"other's backs from thesecrocodiles, we'll be all right."
641,00:42:13.08,00:42:13.08,">> Even though we can't seethem, there's probably hundreds"

646,00:42:24.88,00:42:24.88,">> You'll have to stick needlesin my eyeballs, I will not give"
647,00:42:27.04,00:42:27.04,"up.>> Wow, I just didn't really see"
648,00:42:35.04,00:42:35.04,"that one coming at all.I mean, I don't really know why"
649,00:42:39.08,00:42:39.08,I got voted off.I just feel really naive.
650,00:42:41.88,00:42:41.88,"Either way, it was such anamazing experience."
651,00:42:44.12,00:42:44.12,"You know, I got to live inGuatemala for almost a week and"
652,00:42:46.62,00:42:46.62,I've done a lot of thingsthat I didn't think I
653,00:42:48.58,00:42:48.58,"could do, so the experience ofit all was worth every second."
