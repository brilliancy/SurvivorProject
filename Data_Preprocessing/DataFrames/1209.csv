458,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,It was an awful feeling and oneof the most miserable

461,00:28:18.04,00:28:18.04,We really are.>> That was fine.
462,00:28:22.83,00:28:22.83,">> Going into the challengetoday, I knew immunity was"
463,00:28:25.04,00:28:25.04,vital because my back iscompletely against the wall.
464,00:28:27.46,00:28:27.46,"So when shocker of all shockers,Terry comes through with yet"
465,00:28:30.62,00:28:30.62,"another win, I realize thatthat was probably the end of"
466,00:28:33.33,00:28:33.33,"the game for me.>> Good job, man."
467,00:28:35.50,00:28:35.50,>> Thanks.Winning the immunity necklace
468,00:28:38.25,00:28:38.25,again keeps me out of hot water.Kinda puts me in a place where
469,00:28:41.54,00:28:41.54,I can use the hidden immunityidol as a big hunk of bait.
470,00:28:48.04,00:28:48.04,">> I mean, we developed a hugerespect."
471,00:28:49.67,00:28:49.67,>> Does she want to get to thefinal five...
472,00:28:56.75,00:28:56.75,"Yeah, I have it, and I want tostrategically put it on the line"
473,00:28:59.88,00:28:59.88,"so we, us three, keep going.If Bruce and Danielle will come"
474,00:29:04.46,00:29:04.46,"over to our side, we'll have thenumbers."
475,00:29:06.54,00:29:06.54,"And to lure Danielle over, Iwill give her the immunity idol."
476,00:29:10.21,00:29:10.21,"We'll give it to her, but firstI got to ask Bruce if she comes"
477,00:29:13.62,00:29:13.62,"over, will you come overtonight?"
478,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,"And if that's the case, if itall works out, then we're going"
479,00:29:18.04,00:29:18.04,to the final five.>> Have I ever told you how big
480,00:29:22.25,00:29:22.25,of stud you are?>> Isn't he just sick?
481,00:29:25.12,00:29:25.12,">> In a major twist of fate, Ifound out that my man Terry"
482,00:29:29.50,00:29:29.50,found the immunity idol.And now we haves us some
483,00:29:31.92,00:29:31.92,bargaining chips.They're concocting their plan.
484,00:29:47.12,00:29:47.12,"You're not part of it, Bruce.>> Terry comes over to me"
485,00:29:58.92,00:29:58.92,and he said he found out thatI'm at the bottom of the Casaya
486,00:30:02.17,00:30:02.17,pecking order and I'm gonna bethe first to go and Danielle
487,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,second.You're at sixth place with them.
488,00:30:07.46,00:30:07.46,Your only chance is with us.>> I like Terry. I admire him.
489,00:30:14.08,00:30:14.08,Terry and I have respect foreach other.
490,00:30:15.75,00:30:15.75,"And if I'm at the bottom of thepecking order, then Casaya tribe"
491,00:30:19.42,00:30:19.42,broke their trust.And so everything's up for
492,00:30:22.25,00:30:22.25,grabs.>> What?
493,00:30:33.92,00:30:33.92,>> Yes.>> No way.
494,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,No way.>> ...so you don't have to worry
495,00:30:41.75,00:30:41.75,about it.We wanted to play it safe.
496,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,We get back from the challengeand we need to talk: who are we
497,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,gonna vote for?And in my head I had already
498,00:30:51.12,00:30:51.12,thought it out 'cause I'massuming that if anybody has the
499,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,"immunity idol, it's Terry.>> That's crazy."
500,00:31:01.21,00:31:01.21,You think Terry wants to givehis idol to us?
501,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67,It's an individual game rightnow.
502,00:31:05.25,00:31:05.25,He needs that in his backpocket.
503,00:31:07.00,00:31:07.00,"Even if he does have it, whichhe doesn't, he's not about to"
504,00:31:09.88,00:31:09.88,give it away.>> You're not listening to me.
505,00:31:11.54,00:31:11.54,Have you listened to me onesecond?
506,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,">> Yeah, exactly.>> Y'all chill, chill, chill."
507,00:31:14.88,00:31:14.88,"Aras and Courtney, they gotinto a big argument."
508,00:31:17.83,00:31:17.83,The problem is Terry alreadyhas immunity.
509,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,"And then say Terry has thehidden immunity idol, he could"
510,00:31:23.33,00:31:23.33,give that to anyone he wantedto.
511,00:31:25.54,00:31:25.54,"So say all of us vote forAustin, and Austin pulls out the"
512,00:31:29.88,00:31:29.88,"idol, then the person with thenext-highest amount of votes,"
513,00:31:33.38,00:31:33.38,"which would probably be Aras,will go home."
514,00:31:35.75,00:31:35.75,>> This is so stupid.>> Would you hit me with just a
515,00:31:41.08,00:31:41.08,little bit of respect right now?>> You treat me with a
516,00:31:42.62,00:31:42.62,little respect.>> How am I not respecting you?
517,00:31:43.92,00:31:43.92,">> Wait, wait.>> I haven't disrespected one"
518,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,word and you're calling mestupid?
519,00:31:47.12,00:31:47.12,>> Just relax.>> Go over there and help Shane
520,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,with the fire and we'll talk.Seriously.
521,00:31:52.17,00:31:52.17,"Because look at you right now.Go ahead, go with Shane right"
522,00:31:55.08,00:31:55.08,now with the fire.>> Did you see that?
523,00:31:57.29,00:31:57.29,">> Yeah.>> For the first time ever,"
524,00:32:00.58,00:32:00.58,"Aras really, like, freaked meout."
525,00:32:04.17,00:32:04.17,I think the boys just want tocover their ass and they want
526,00:32:05.83,00:32:05.83,to get the girls off.That's exactly why he was so
527,00:32:07.88,00:32:07.88,aggressive about it.>> I've never seen him like
528,00:32:09.46,00:32:09.46,"that.>> He was, like, psycho."
529,00:32:11.38,00:32:11.38,The hidden immunity idol hasshaken things up.
530,00:32:14.46,00:32:14.46,"I mean I want to stay loyal, butif Austin does have the hidden"
531,00:32:17.08,00:32:17.08,"immunity idol, then if Arasgoes, well, I'm sorry but Aras"
532,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,needs to be voted off at somepoint.
533,00:32:28.42,00:32:28.42,>> Courtney has not displayedone bit of intelligence since
534,00:32:31.58,00:32:31.58,she's been out here and it'sinteresting that the two Casaya
535,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,guys are not being protected bytheir tribe.
536,00:32:38.46,00:32:38.46,Either it's shortsightedness orthey don't mind losing one of
537,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,us.>> Why? 
538,00:33:21.00,00:33:21.00,">> I have been on Exile Islandfor two days, I come back and,"
539,00:33:24.04,00:33:24.04,"bam, everybody's going crazy.Austin and Terry said that I"
540,00:33:29.17,00:33:29.17,was on the top of the line toget knocked off.
541,00:33:31.75,00:33:31.75,And then Terry promised me thathe would give me the immunity
542,00:33:33.71,00:33:33.71,idol to get me to flop to bewith them.
543,00:33:40.21,00:33:40.21,It's tempting.I don't know if I trust Aras.
544,00:33:44.08,00:33:44.08,So I have a lot of power.The ball's in my hand.
545,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,I could actually transform thisgame into a whole new thing and
546,00:33:50.71,00:33:50.71,maybe there's going to besomebody different going home
547,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,than everybody thinks.>> I do not agree.
548,00:34:07.54,00:34:07.54,">> We'll see what happens>> Basically, we're playing a"
549,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,shell game.Where's the ball?
550,00:34:13.00,00:34:13.00,Under which shell?And Casaya is divided on the
551,00:34:15.54,00:34:15.54,vote.>> Great.
552,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,>> So I absolutely feel at riskand I'm crossing my fingers and
553,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,just hoping that I don't get awhammy.
554,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,">> PROBST: Hello, everybody.>> Hey."
555,00:34:49.88,00:34:49.88,>> Hey.>> PROBST: Let's start with the
556,00:34:51.71,00:34:51.71,"reward challenge.Aras, it was clear even to me"
557,00:34:53.79,00:34:53.79,that even though you andDanielle were on separate
558,00:34:56.08,00:34:56.08,"teams, you guys were workingtogether."
559,00:34:58.12,00:34:58.12,>> I feel like the team of menhad a bit of an advantage and
560,00:35:00.79,00:35:00.79,"so I looked at my group and said""Let's put all our coconuts in"
561,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,"the men's boat and hopefully,we can get the women to do the"
562,00:35:06.29,00:35:06.29,"same,"" which would give us bothan equal shot at winning it."
563,00:35:09.54,00:35:09.54,">> Actually, it was really agood plan for Aras because we"
564,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,helped him stop the men andhelped him win.
565,00:35:16.71,00:35:16.71,"Sorry, Aras.>> PROBST: Aras, it's tough to"
566,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,put yourself on a limb likethat because you expose
