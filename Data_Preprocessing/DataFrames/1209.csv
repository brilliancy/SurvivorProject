33,00:01:21.25,00:01:21.25,Austin's struggling to hang in there.
34,00:01:23.46,00:01:23.46,>> PROBST: Austin's out. Terry's determination paid off.

46,00:02:00.04,00:02:00.04,probably going to pay the price for that.

58,00:03:03.58,00:03:03.58,"well, I tanked that challenge on purpose so that I didn't look"
59,00:03:06.25,00:03:06.25,"too strong."" I was, like, oh, my gosh, what"
60,00:03:09.29,00:03:09.29,have we done? I just felt like the wrong guy
61,00:03:11.33,00:03:11.33,went. >> My mouth kept dropping each
62,00:03:16.08,00:03:16.08,"time. Yesterday, I thought I had come"
63,00:03:19.83,00:03:19.83,off with the greatest caper of all time.
64,00:03:22.33,00:03:22.33,"But when it looked like it wasn't working, and I'm going"
65,00:03:24.62,00:03:24.62,"home, I wanted everyone to at least know, ""Hey, I could have"
66,00:03:26.88,00:03:26.88,"hung a little bit longer, guys."" Now, in retrospect, that was so"
67,00:03:29.88,00:03:29.88,stupid to let them know my plan because now I'm afraid
68,00:03:33.71,00:03:33.71,people are questioning whether they really trust me.
69,00:03:41.88,00:03:41.88,>> These snails are like members of La Mina: slimy and hard to
70,00:03:45.25,00:03:45.25,"get out. >> Oh, Aras, aren't you being"
71,00:03:48.38,00:03:48.38,"cutthroat? >> No. They're cutthroat, and"
72,00:03:50.96,00:03:50.96,Austin is a slimeball. >> He's a slimeball.
73,00:03:54.79,00:03:54.79,">> A slimeball. >> Yeah, you're right."
74,00:03:56.75,00:03:56.75,I can't trust him. That's for sure.
75,00:03:58.25,00:03:58.25,>> He's going to try to work everybody.
76,00:04:00.21,00:04:00.21,The one thing we have to make sure is that we don't reveal
77,00:04:02.83,00:04:02.83,"anything, period. >> Today's a new day, and new"
78,00:04:30.25,00:04:30.25,numbers are rolling through my head.
79,00:04:32.54,00:04:32.54,Casaya-- they're sitting there all happy because they have the
80,00:04:34.46,00:04:34.46,numbers. But if I can draw two of those
81,00:04:36.96,00:04:36.96,"people over on our side, the tables could turn."
82,00:04:42.75,00:04:42.75,I'm still a team guy. I'm still a La Mina guy versus
83,00:04:45.88,00:04:45.88,"the remaining Casaya members, and I'm hoping to turn it"
84,00:04:49.21,00:04:49.21,"around a little bit, and we'll see what happens."
85,00:04:51.67,00:04:51.67,There's always hope. >> Tree mail!
86,00:04:55.17,00:04:55.17,It's going to be a fun one. Here. Ready?

88,00:05:04.00,00:05:04.00,"some guts. But, in political battles,"
89,00:05:07.96,00:05:07.96,"you'll always deal with nuts."" >> All political."
90,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,>> Tree mail said something about making political
91,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,"decisions and, as far as Austin and Terry and I go, that's a"
92,00:05:20.92,00:05:20.92,good challenge to have come our way at this point.
93,00:05:23.79,00:05:23.79,">> Yay! It sounds like a fun one, doesn't it?"
94,00:05:25.71,00:05:25.71,>> Yeah. >> We're hoping that maybe it
95,00:05:27.71,00:05:27.71,will create some conflict for the original Casaya members and
96,00:05:30.29,00:05:30.29,shake things up a little bit around here.
97,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Ready to get to today's"
98,00:05:44.62,00:05:44.62,challenge? >> Yeah. Ready.
99,00:05:46.50,00:05:46.50,>> PROBST: It is for reward. Here's how it works.
100,00:05:48.58,00:05:48.58,We're going to divide into three teams.
101,00:05:50.83,00:05:50.83,Each team will have one boat and 100 coconuts.
102,00:05:53.79,00:05:53.79,"On my go, you're going to race to take your coconuts and put"
103,00:05:57.08,00:05:57.08,them in the boats of the other two teams.
104,00:05:59.92,00:05:59.92,"The more you put into another team's boat, the more it's"
105,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,"going to slow them down later. Keep in mind, while you're doing"
106,00:06:04.88,00:06:04.88,"this to their boat, they're doing it to your boat."
107,00:06:07.46,00:06:07.46,"Once you're rid of all your coconuts, get in your boat,"
108,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,"paddle out, retrieve a tribe flag and a fishing net, then"
109,00:06:13.50,00:06:13.50,make your way back to shore. You'll use the fishing net to
110,00:06:16.42,00:06:16.42,now carry all the coconuts that the other teams have put into
111,00:06:20.00,00:06:20.00,"your boat back up the beach, put them in the bin."
112,00:06:23.33,00:06:23.33,"First tribe to get all the coconuts in their bin, get on"
113,00:06:25.33,00:06:25.33,"their finish map with the tribe flag, wins reward."
114,00:06:27.50,00:06:27.50,Want to know what you're playing for?
115,00:06:29.08,00:06:29.08,>> Yes. >> PROBST: For the winning tribe
116,00:06:30.62,00:06:30.62,"of three, you'll be picked up tomorrow by boat, taken to a"
117,00:06:33.17,00:06:33.17,lovely little spot where you will find a bed and breakfast
118,00:06:37.25,00:06:37.25,waiting for you. >> Yeah!
119,00:06:39.83,00:06:39.83,">> PROBST: Bacon, eggs, mimosas. In addition, the winning team"
120,00:06:43.58,00:06:43.58,of three will decide who goes to Exile Island.
121,00:06:47.62,00:06:47.62,All right. We're going to randomly divide
122,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,into teams. We'll get started.
123,00:06:52.88,00:06:52.88,"There are three teams: Shane, Terry, Austin."
124,00:06:55.71,00:06:55.71,"Bruce, Aras and Sally. Danielle, Courtney, Cirie."
125,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67,"Here we go, for reward, a breakfast in bed!"
126,00:07:03.00,00:07:03.00,Survivors ready? Go!
127,00:07:05.17,00:07:05.17,Trying to get all of your coconuts in somebody else's
128,00:07:07.92,00:07:07.92,"boat. You drop a coconut, you have to"
129,00:07:10.67,00:07:10.67,"pick it up. Austin hunched over, moving"
130,00:07:17.71,00:07:17.71,quickly. Terry and Aras right behind him.
131,00:07:20.17,00:07:20.17,"Get those coconuts in the boat as quickly as you can, and get"
132,00:07:23.29,00:07:23.29,back! Austin and Terry unload into
133,00:07:25.88,00:07:25.88,"Cirie, Danielle and Courtney's boat."
134,00:07:29.21,00:07:29.21,"Aras going to load up on Terry, Shane and Austin."
135,00:07:31.67,00:07:31.67,Danielle loses one. That's going to slow her down.
136,00:07:35.08,00:07:35.08,"The sooner you unload your coconuts, the faster you paddle"
137,00:07:37.75,00:07:37.75,"out and get back. Aras, Austin and Terry coming"
138,00:07:41.38,00:07:41.38,with a lot of coconuts. Who are they targeting?
139,00:07:44.25,00:07:44.25,Austin and Terry are going after the girls.
140,00:07:46.71,00:07:46.71,"Aras is heading right back to Terry, Shane and Austin's boat."
141,00:07:49.71,00:07:49.71,"Figured out a good strategy, ganging up on the three guys."
142,00:07:53.42,00:07:53.42,">> Danielle, stay in their boat. We're not putting in any in"
143,00:07:56.00,00:07:56.00,yours. >> PROBST: Aras and Danielle on

146,00:08:03.67,00:08:03.67,"boat, the tougher it's going to be."
147,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,"Courtney with more coconuts for Terry, Austin and Shane."

193,00:10:15.42,00:10:15.42,">> PROBST: Shane, Austin, Terry trying to unload, but they still"
194,00:10:18.46,00:10:18.46,have more coconuts in their boat.
195,00:10:20.88,00:10:20.88,"Aras, Bruce, Sally have all their coconuts in this net."
196,00:10:24.79,00:10:24.79,">> Come on! >> PROBST: Terry, Austin and"
197,00:10:27.42,00:10:27.42,Shane not giving up. They don't have a lot of
198,00:10:29.50,00:10:29.50,"coconuts left. Remember, you've got to have"
199,00:10:31.12,00:10:31.12,your tribe flag to finish. >> Go get the tribe flag.
200,00:10:36.46,00:10:36.46,"Go get the tribe flag, Sally! >> PROBST: Sally forgot the"
201,00:10:40.08,00:10:40.08,"flag, had to go back and get it. That's given time to Shane,"
202,00:10:43.25,00:10:43.25,"Austin, and Terry. Bruce and Aras trying to unload"
203,00:10:46.58,00:10:46.58,as fast as they can. Sally has the tribe flag.
204,00:10:50.04,00:10:50.04,It's coming down to the wire. The guys have to unload before
205,00:10:53.17,00:10:53.17,Sally makes it up the beach. It's going to be close.
206,00:10:58.67,00:10:58.67,>> Let's go. >> PROBST: Sally's got it.
207,00:11:01.12,00:11:01.12,"Bruce, Aras, Sally win reward! >> Yes! Good strategy, guys."
208,00:11:05.92,00:11:05.92,"Way to play. >> PROBST: Okay, Bruce, Aras,"
209,00:11:13.33,00:11:13.33,"Sally, tomorrow morning the boat will pick you up, take you to a"
210,00:11:16.83,00:11:16.83,"nice little spot, breakfast in bed."
211,00:11:18.92,00:11:18.92,Right now big decision to make. Who are you going to send to
212,00:11:21.58,00:11:21.58,Exile Island? You will choose one person from
213,00:11:24.88,00:11:24.88,each team. >> From each team?
214,00:11:32.08,00:11:32.08,">> PROBST: All right, first team, who's going to Exile"
215,00:11:33.79,00:11:33.79,Island? >> Austin.
216,00:11:36.17,00:11:36.17,>> PROBST: Austin. First time there.
217,00:11:38.50,00:11:38.50,"Cirie, Danielle, Courtney? >> Danielle."
218,00:11:44.12,00:11:44.12,>> PROBST: Danielle is going to Exile Island.
219,00:11:46.29,00:11:46.29,Boat's waiting for you. You're heading out.
220,00:11:53.42,00:11:53.42,"Bruce, Aras, and Sally, boat will pick the three of you up"
221,00:11:56.92,00:11:56.92,"in the morning, take you to breakfast in bed."
222,00:11:59.00,00:11:59.00,"For the rest of you, I've got nothing for you."
223,00:12:01.12,00:12:01.12,Head on back to camp. (thunder rumbling)
224,00:12:27.46,00:12:27.46,>> Winning the reward challenge is the greatest thing in the
225,00:12:30.33,00:12:30.33,whole wide world. I get to have breakfast in bed
226,00:12:32.83,00:12:32.83,"with Bruce and Aras, which is going to be really interesting."
227,00:12:36.46,00:12:36.46,>> I'm getting irritable right now.
228,00:12:39.12,00:12:39.12,Where is the boat? I wake up like a kid on
229,00:12:42.21,00:12:42.21,"Christmas. I woke up so early, but we're"
230,00:12:44.29,00:12:44.29,waiting for this boat and it's just not coming.
231,00:12:46.83,00:12:46.83,"It's raining out. Like, there is no boat and I'm"
232,00:12:49.17,00:12:49.17,"just getting pretty anxious. >> Ship ahoy, man."
233,00:12:53.17,00:12:53.17,Say it. Ship ahoy.
234,00:12:54.75,00:12:54.75,>> There's no ship. >> The moment I won it I
235,00:12:56.88,00:12:56.88,realized what I'd done. I not only exposed a little bit
236,00:13:00.17,00:13:00.17,"of my athleticism, but a lot of my wit."
237,00:13:03.04,00:13:03.04,So the reward challenge did put a target on my back.
238,00:13:05.71,00:13:05.71,"I won the battle in spite of the war, maybe."
239,00:13:10.83,00:13:10.83,>> Is that us? >> Excellent.
240,00:13:13.67,00:13:13.67,>> Brucey. >> Sally.
241,00:13:15.88,00:13:15.88,">> Oh, that's a nice sized boat. >> Yeah."
242,00:13:19.50,00:13:19.50,>> Awesome. >> Whoo!
243,00:13:22.08,00:13:22.08,>> Bye. Enjoy the bacon and the eggs.
244,00:13:31.00,00:13:31.00,">> Aras, Bruce and I get in this boat and we're just like"
245,00:13:34.08,00:13:34.08,"huddled in the front, like, drenched, having no idea where"
246,00:13:37.17,00:13:37.17,"we're going, having no idea what to expect."
247,00:13:39.17,00:13:39.17,And it's like this sandbar in the middle of nowhere with this
248,00:13:41.79,00:13:41.79,beautiful canopy bed and it's pouring rain.
249,00:13:44.46,00:13:44.46,"And I'm, like, there is no way that that is our reward."
250,00:13:47.79,00:13:47.79,"I was so frustrated. >> Oh, the whole bed is wet."
251,00:13:56.54,00:13:56.54,">> Gosh, that sucks! The sheets are wet; the blankets"
252,00:14:00.50,00:14:00.50,"are wet; I mean, we're drenched; we're cold."
253,00:14:03.92,00:14:03.92,>> Good morning. Are you ready for breakfast?
254,00:14:06.75,00:14:06.75,">> Yeah. >> Just relax, we'll bring you"
255,00:14:08.75,00:14:08.75,breakfast in bed. >> Oh.
256,00:14:12.04,00:14:12.04,>> Enjoy. >> All of a sudden this tray is
257,00:14:15.08,00:14:15.08,"set down and, I'm not kidding you, it went from, like, this"
258,00:14:18.25,00:14:18.25,cold miserable moment to the most incredible day ever.
259,00:14:28.96,00:14:28.96,>> This is coffee. >> It was kind of bittersweet
260,00:14:32.17,00:14:32.17,"'cause two of our friends had to go to Exile Island, but I"
261,00:14:35.00,00:14:35.00,thought there was a meal fit for a king and royalty.
262,00:14:38.08,00:14:38.08,"Orange juice, sweet rolls, fresh toast, butter and jelly"
263,00:14:42.67,00:14:42.67,"and hot pressed coffee with cream and sugar, and the bacon"
264,00:14:46.12,00:14:46.12,was out of this world. >> Fruit?
265,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,">> Oh, look at those raspberries!"
266,00:14:51.42,00:14:51.42,>> We just devoured it. It was every man for himself.
267,00:14:54.88,00:14:54.88,>> That croissant put me over the edge.
268,00:14:57.25,00:14:57.25,>> Champagne. >> Oh!
269,00:14:59.08,00:14:59.08,>> To the victors. >> I never thought I could be
270,00:15:01.21,00:15:01.21,cold and wet and in a bed with two strange men and feel so
271,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,comfortable. It was the best meal I've ever
272,00:15:07.42,00:15:07.42,"had. >> Oh, I meant to ask Aras why"
273,00:15:23.92,00:15:23.92,he picked Danielle over Courtney.
274,00:15:26.38,00:15:26.38,Do you think he thought Danielle could handle herself a little
275,00:15:29.21,00:15:29.21,better than Courtney out there? My strategy is to try to coax
276,00:15:34.00,00:15:34.00,out of those guys who do they think is going to be in the
277,00:15:37.71,00:15:37.71,"final four and with that, it puts two of their players kind"
278,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,of out there. >> What are your odds on the
279,00:15:43.83,00:15:43.83,"final four, man? What do you think?"
280,00:15:46.83,00:15:46.83,"You, Aras, Cirie and... tough choice between Courtney and"
281,00:15:51.29,00:15:51.29,Danielle. >> I think we should put $20 on
282,00:16:06.21,00:16:06.21,"it, Shane. I found out some very important"
283,00:16:10.08,00:16:10.08,"stuff. Two of their players, Danielle"
284,00:16:12.42,00:16:12.42,"and Bruce, are the next on the pecking order, and if I can get"
285,00:16:15.42,00:16:15.42,"those guys over to our side, this will totally swing the"
286,00:16:18.75,00:16:18.75,"game. >> Oh, they are back."
287,00:16:25.17,00:16:25.17,They got bacon with them? I try not to think about the
288,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,breakfast because I don't want to hate them any more than I do
289,00:16:35.83,00:16:35.83,right now. (laughs)
290,00:16:39.00,00:16:39.00,">> Toast, yeah, toast with butter and jam."
291,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,>> And then we had to listen to the stories of chocolate
292,00:16:43.92,00:16:43.92,croissants and sausages. >> I had some of Sally's bacon.
293,00:16:48.25,00:16:48.25,I couldn't eat any... I was dizzy.
294,00:16:55.04,00:16:55.04,(laughing) >> Look at my stomach.
295,00:17:03.08,00:17:03.08,">> Oh, my God. >> Rub it for luck."
296,00:17:05.42,00:17:05.42,>> I don't care how big your stomach was.
297,00:17:08.12,00:17:08.12,That kind of pissed me off. We're starving eating beans and
298,00:17:11.42,00:17:11.42,"you're going, ""Look, I'm so full."""
299,00:17:14.12,00:17:14.12,>> That's a belly! I know.
300,00:17:16.29,00:17:16.29,>> I have to win something or I will die in Panama.
301,00:17:22.12,00:17:22.12,(thunder rumbling) >> This sucks so bad.
302,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,This is unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.
303,00:17:42.25,00:17:42.25,It never stops. (thunder rumbling)
304,00:18:10.08,00:18:10.08,>> Exile is just miserable. Ever since yesterday it's not
305,00:18:14.17,00:18:14.17,stopped raining. It's cold as hell.
306,00:18:16.79,00:18:16.79,This is the most miserable I've ever been in my life.
307,00:18:26.25,00:18:26.25,>> This is putting up a strong fight to be the worst day here.
308,00:18:32.08,00:18:32.08,">> Yeah, it is. >> And don't get me wrong:"
309,00:18:33.75,00:18:33.75,every day here sucked. >> Everything's wet.
310,00:18:36.08,00:18:36.08,You can't even build a fire. Austin and I have been hiding
311,00:18:38.79,00:18:38.79,"under a tree, but we're still getting soaked and it's just"
312,00:18:42.42,00:18:42.42,miserable. >> Being on Exile Island under
313,00:18:48.54,00:18:48.54,the torrential rains forced me to go into the quickest bonding
314,00:18:52.46,00:18:52.46,experience I've ever been through.
315,00:18:54.46,00:18:54.46,"Luckily, Danielle and I got along great and she stood"
316,00:18:57.33,00:18:57.33,strong and I was proud of her. >> Out of all of the people
317,00:19:05.46,00:19:05.46,"that I had to get stuck on the island, I'm glad it was Austin."
318,00:19:08.62,00:19:08.62,I know him a little bit more personally and I have a little
319,00:19:12.25,00:19:12.25,"bit more trust built with him. God forbid something did change,"
320,00:19:16.08,00:19:16.08,"then, yeah, I am thinking logically that Austin would be,"
321,00:19:19.75,00:19:19.75,"you know, a backup plan. >> We're now down to three"
322,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,"ex-La Mina members, and at this point, there don't seem to be"
323,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,any chinks in the armor right now with Casaya.
324,00:19:50.50,00:19:50.50,They don't like us; they don't want us here; they're just
325,00:19:52.71,00:19:52.71,"waiting to pick us off and you're going ""What can I"
326,00:19:54.71,00:19:54.71,"possibly do to change this?"" What happens if Austin and"
327,00:19:57.75,00:19:57.75,Danielle found it? Who gets it?
328,00:20:00.29,00:20:00.29,>> I have it. >> Are you serious?
329,00:20:02.17,00:20:02.17,>> I am serious as a heart attack.
330,00:20:04.21,00:20:04.21,I found it in 20 minutes. >> Shut up.
331,00:20:07.54,00:20:07.54,>> No. I have it.
332,00:20:09.29,00:20:09.29,I've always had it. I had it from the first
333,00:20:12.08,00:20:12.08,"frickin' day, 20 minutes later. >> Terry has the individual"
334,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,immunity idol from Exile Island and I just about pooped my
335,00:20:19.00,00:20:19.00,"pants. I dug holes out there, so I"
336,00:20:22.25,00:20:22.25,"could just smack him, but I'm so thrilled to hear that."
337,00:20:25.25,00:20:25.25,"Holy ..., Terry. God, this is a great day."
338,00:20:28.96,00:20:28.96,"I love it. I mean, the whole game changes."
339,00:20:31.50,00:20:31.50,"That's a huge ace in the hole, and I'm so excited for the next"
340,00:20:34.42,00:20:34.42,"immunity challenge because if Terry wins, he could slip either"
341,00:20:37.62,00:20:37.62,Austin or I the idol and I'm home.
342,00:20:40.50,00:20:40.50,"I'm absolutely thrilled. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
343,00:20:51.46,00:20:51.46,We'll now bring in Danielle and Austin returning from Exile
344,00:20:54.54,00:20:54.54,Island. (applause)
345,00:20:58.08,00:20:58.08,">> That was no vacation, buddy. >> PROBST: You guys look"
346,00:21:01.08,00:21:01.08,exhausted. >> Worst experience of my whole
347,00:21:03.12,00:21:03.12,life. >> That goes down in my book.
348,00:21:04.67,00:21:04.67,>> PROBST: What was the worst part?
349,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,>> It did not stop raining. Couldn't get a fire started
350,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,"'cause everything was just wet. >> I mean, we, the whole time,"
351,00:21:11.29,00:21:11.29,"feared hypothermia. It was, it was miserable."
352,00:21:13.12,00:21:13.12,>> PROBST: And now you got to take part in an immunity
353,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,challenge. >> It's unbelievable.
354,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,>> PROBST: Let's get to it. First things first. Terry?
355,00:21:24.00,00:21:24.00,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
356,00:21:27.00,00:21:27.00,"For today's immunity challenge, you will race through a series"
357,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,of Survivor obstacles. It will work in four stages.
358,00:21:33.54,00:21:33.54,"Here's how it goes. For the first stage, all nine of"
359,00:21:36.38,00:21:36.38,you must race to dig through the sand and pull yourself under a
360,00:21:40.25,00:21:40.25,wooden fence. The first six to finish move on
361,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,"to the next round. For the second phase, you must"
362,00:21:45.50,00:21:45.50,complete a brain teaser. Four written clues will guide
363,00:21:48.79,00:21:48.79,you. As soon as you're done with the
364,00:21:50.42,00:21:50.42,"brain teaser, you'll go up a sand hill, through the maze,"
365,00:21:53.17,00:21:53.17,over a second sand hill. First three to finish this phase
366,00:21:56.75,00:21:56.75,"move on. For the third phase, you will"
367,00:21:58.88,00:21:58.88,navigate your way across a rope bridge using two wooden planks.
368,00:22:02.04,00:22:02.04,"Once you reach the end of the bridge, jump off the platform"
369,00:22:05.58,00:22:05.58,"into the water, climb up a steep sand bank."
370,00:22:08.88,00:22:08.88,First two to finish move on to the final round.
371,00:22:12.50,00:22:12.50,"For the final round, you will race through a series of"
372,00:22:14.92,00:22:14.92,"vertical, horizontal tunnels and towers."
373,00:22:17.46,00:22:17.46,First person to finish wins immunity; guaranteed a
374,00:22:20.17,00:22:20.17,one-in-eight shot at a million bucks.
375,00:22:23.04,00:22:23.04,For the losers? Tribal Council. Somebody will be voted out.
376,00:22:25.29,00:22:25.29,You will become the first member of our jury.
377,00:22:27.62,00:22:27.62,The stakes are getting big. Everybody ready?
378,00:22:29.67,00:22:29.67,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Take a spot.
379,00:22:31.29,00:22:31.29,"We'll get started. Here we go, first round."
380,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,Six people moving on. Survivors ready. Go!
381,00:22:38.33,00:22:38.33,"Dig through the sand, pull yourself under the fence."
382,00:22:43.33,00:22:43.33,"Aras digging, Courtney making good progress."
383,00:22:47.96,00:22:47.96,Aras is first through. He's stuck!
384,00:22:51.21,00:22:51.21,He's got to dig a little bit more of a hole for his butt.
385,00:22:54.50,00:22:54.50,Courtney coming through. Courtney's stuck.
386,00:22:57.71,00:22:57.71,Aras still struggling. Scraping skin off.
387,00:23:00.96,00:23:00.96,Shane trying to get through. Sally moving through.
388,00:23:05.50,00:23:05.50,Sally's across. Austin nowhere close.
389,00:23:09.21,00:23:09.21,Danielle's now through. Four more people moving on.
390,00:23:14.67,00:23:14.67,Courtney's through. Terry's through.
391,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,Two spots left. Shane is stuck.
392,00:23:19.17,00:23:19.17,Gotta get through to get on to win immunity.
393,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,"Cirie is falling out of it. Bruce still fighting, Austin"
394,00:23:26.00,00:23:26.00,still fighting. Who wants it?
395,00:23:28.33,00:23:28.33,Aras was the first one through the fence and he's still stuck.
396,00:23:31.33,00:23:31.33,Shane moving on to the next phase.
397,00:23:33.17,00:23:33.17,One spot left. Austin moving on!
398,00:23:44.25,00:23:44.25,"Second phase. Sally, Shane, Danielle,"
399,00:23:47.21,00:23:47.21,"Courtney, Terry and Austin. First three to finish move on to"
400,00:23:51.25,00:23:51.25,the next round. Survivors ready.
401,00:23:54.12,00:23:54.12,Go. It's a brain teaser.
402,00:23:56.25,00:23:56.25,"Read the clues, move the rocks accordingly."
403,00:23:58.96,00:23:58.96,The green rock is in the same column as the black and the blue
404,00:24:03.00,00:24:03.00,rocks. The yellow rock is to the left
405,00:24:07.42,00:24:07.42,of the green and directly above the orange rock.
406,00:24:17.12,00:24:17.12,Austin thinks he's got it. Austin has it right. Move on.
407,00:24:22.21,00:24:22.21,The white rock is to the right of the red.
408,00:24:25.79,00:24:25.79,Sally has it right. Move on. Only three people moving on.
409,00:24:31.04,00:24:31.04,Yes! Go! Terry through. Danielle through.
410,00:24:34.46,00:24:34.46,Austin and Sally with a little bit of a lead.
411,00:24:37.21,00:24:37.21,"Courtney has it right. Move on. Shane, move on."
412,00:24:39.75,00:24:39.75,Austin really hustling. Sally moving through.
413,00:24:43.21,00:24:43.21,Terry right behind making up some time.
414,00:24:46.17,00:24:46.17,Danielle not giving up. Shane hustling to get back in
415,00:24:48.75,00:24:48.75,it. Courtney's quickly falling out
416,00:24:50.79,00:24:50.79,of it. Austin with a big lead now.
417,00:24:52.75,00:24:52.75,First three through move on. Austin's through.
418,00:24:58.79,00:24:58.79,Two spots left. Terry fighting to stay in this.
419,00:25:02.21,00:25:02.21,Danielle falling out of it. Sally's through.
420,00:25:06.67,00:25:06.67,"Shane not giving up. Terry, Sally, Austin."
421,00:25:12.08,00:25:12.08,All three ex-La Mina members moving on to the next round.
422,00:25:18.71,00:25:18.71,Here we go. First two to finish move on to the final round.
423,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,Survivors ready. Go! Gotta use the planks to get
424,00:25:26.12,00:25:26.12,across the bridge one plank at a time.
425,00:25:29.96,00:25:29.96,"Balance, coordination, patience. Manage all that with immunity on"
426,00:25:34.54,00:25:34.54,the line. Sally with a bit of a lead.
427,00:25:37.17,00:25:37.17,Terry right in there. Austin-- two days on Exile
428,00:25:40.71,00:25:40.71,Island taking their toll. Terry and Sally neck-and-neck.
429,00:25:43.96,00:25:43.96,Two people moving on. Once you reach the top of the
430,00:25:46.96,00:25:46.96,"platform, jump in the water, climb over the sandy hill."
431,00:25:50.71,00:25:50.71,"Terry and Sally neck-and-neck. Austin not giving up, but"
432,00:25:55.17,00:25:55.17,falling behind. Terry at the end.
433,00:25:57.62,00:25:57.62,"Sally, the first one on the platform."
434,00:26:00.29,00:26:00.29,Terry on. Both in the water. Terry moving on.
435,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,Sally moving on. Austin out of it.
436,00:26:15.50,00:26:15.50,"It is down to Sally and Terry. For immunity, Survivors ready."
437,00:26:20.42,00:26:20.42,"Go! Terry dives through, Sally"
438,00:26:23.92,00:26:23.92,crawling through. Terry makes it through the
439,00:26:31.54,00:26:31.54,crisscross first. Got a bit of a lead on Sally who
440,00:26:34.04,00:26:34.04,has to wait. Pretty even.
441,00:26:37.38,00:26:37.38,Terry drops down. Sally takes her time dropping
442,00:26:40.46,00:26:40.46,down. She's losing some time.
443,00:26:42.46,00:26:42.46,Terry with a bit of a lead. Sally's gonna have to catch up.
444,00:26:47.25,00:26:47.25,"Terry up and over. Crawling down now on his belly,"
445,00:26:50.92,00:26:50.92,raking across it. Sally gonna have to make up some
446,00:26:53.62,00:26:53.62,time right now. Terry starting to dig.
447,00:26:56.50,00:26:56.50,Sally's gonna have to dig quickly.
448,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,First person to the mat wins immunity.
449,00:27:03.75,00:27:03.75,Guaranteed safe at Tribal Council.
450,00:27:06.21,00:27:06.21,It's neck-and-neck! Terry's through.
451,00:27:07.67,00:27:07.67,Sally's through. Terry wins immunity!
452,00:27:22.08,00:27:22.08,"Terry, come on over. Once again, immunity is yours."
453,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,You're safe tonight at Tribal Council.
454,00:27:30.21,00:27:30.21,"For the rest of you, after 21 tough days, this game will come"
455,00:27:33.21,00:27:33.21,to an end tonight for one of you.
456,00:27:35.29,00:27:35.29,Grab your stuff. Head on back. I'll see you at Tribal.
457,00:27:51.21,00:27:51.21,>> I'm so happy to be back here. You guys have no idea.
458,00:27:54.29,00:27:54.29,"When Aras chose me to go to Exile Island, I was so mad."
459,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,It was an awful feeling and one of the most miserable
460,00:28:02.88,00:28:02.88,"experiences of my entire life. Like, if you saw what pain and"
461,00:28:06.88,00:28:06.88,"agony we were both in, you guys would be..."
462,00:28:18.04,00:28:18.04,We really are. >> That was fine.
463,00:28:22.83,00:28:22.83,">> Going into the challenge today, I knew immunity was"
464,00:28:25.04,00:28:25.04,vital because my back is completely against the wall.
465,00:28:27.46,00:28:27.46,"So when shocker of all shockers, Terry comes through with yet"
466,00:28:30.62,00:28:30.62,"another win, I realize that that was probably the end of"
467,00:28:33.33,00:28:33.33,"the game for me. >> Good job, man."
468,00:28:35.50,00:28:35.50,>> Thanks. Winning the immunity necklace
469,00:28:38.25,00:28:38.25,again keeps me out of hot water. Kinda puts me in a place where
470,00:28:41.54,00:28:41.54,I can use the hidden immunity idol as a big hunk of bait.
471,00:28:48.04,00:28:48.04,">> I mean, we developed a huge respect."
472,00:28:49.67,00:28:49.67,>> Does she want to get to the final five...
473,00:28:56.75,00:28:56.75,"Yeah, I have it, and I want to strategically put it on the line"
474,00:28:59.88,00:28:59.88,"so we, us three, keep going. If Bruce and Danielle will come"
475,00:29:04.46,00:29:04.46,"over to our side, we'll have the numbers."
476,00:29:06.54,00:29:06.54,"And to lure Danielle over, I will give her the immunity idol."
477,00:29:10.21,00:29:10.21,"We'll give it to her, but first I got to ask Bruce if she comes"
478,00:29:13.62,00:29:13.62,"over, will you come over tonight?"
479,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,"And if that's the case, if it all works out, then we're going"
480,00:29:18.04,00:29:18.04,to the final five. >> Have I ever told you how big
481,00:29:22.25,00:29:22.25,of stud you are? >> Isn't he just sick?
482,00:29:25.12,00:29:25.12,">> In a major twist of fate, I found out that my man Terry"
483,00:29:29.50,00:29:29.50,found the immunity idol. And now we haves us some
484,00:29:31.92,00:29:31.92,bargaining chips. They're concocting their plan.
485,00:29:47.12,00:29:47.12,"You're not part of it, Bruce. >> Terry comes over to me"
486,00:29:58.92,00:29:58.92,and he said he found out that I'm at the bottom of the Casaya
487,00:30:02.17,00:30:02.17,pecking order and I'm gonna be the first to go and Danielle
488,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,second. You're at sixth place with them.
489,00:30:07.46,00:30:07.46,Your only chance is with us. >> I like Terry. I admire him.
490,00:30:14.08,00:30:14.08,Terry and I have respect for each other.
491,00:30:15.75,00:30:15.75,"And if I'm at the bottom of the pecking order, then Casaya tribe"
492,00:30:19.42,00:30:19.42,broke their trust. And so everything's up for
493,00:30:22.25,00:30:22.25,grabs. >> What?
494,00:30:33.92,00:30:33.92,>> Yes. >> No way.
495,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,No way. >> ...so you don't have to worry
496,00:30:41.75,00:30:41.75,about it. We wanted to play it safe.
497,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,We get back from the challenge and we need to talk: who are we
498,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,gonna vote for? And in my head I had already
499,00:30:51.12,00:30:51.12,thought it out 'cause I'm assuming that if anybody has the
500,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,"immunity idol, it's Terry. >> That's crazy."
501,00:31:01.21,00:31:01.21,You think Terry wants to give his idol to us?
502,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67,It's an individual game right now.
503,00:31:05.25,00:31:05.25,He needs that in his back pocket.
504,00:31:07.00,00:31:07.00,"Even if he does have it, which he doesn't, he's not about to"
505,00:31:09.88,00:31:09.88,give it away. >> You're not listening to me.
506,00:31:11.54,00:31:11.54,Have you listened to me one second?
507,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,">> Yeah, exactly. >> Y'all chill, chill, chill."
508,00:31:14.88,00:31:14.88,"Aras and Courtney, they got into a big argument."
509,00:31:17.83,00:31:17.83,The problem is Terry already has immunity.
510,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,"And then say Terry has the hidden immunity idol, he could"
511,00:31:23.33,00:31:23.33,give that to anyone he wanted to.
512,00:31:25.54,00:31:25.54,"So say all of us vote for Austin, and Austin pulls out the"
513,00:31:29.88,00:31:29.88,"idol, then the person with the next-highest amount of votes,"
514,00:31:33.38,00:31:33.38,"which would probably be Aras, will go home."
515,00:31:35.75,00:31:35.75,>> This is so stupid. >> Would you hit me with just a
516,00:31:41.08,00:31:41.08,little bit of respect right now? >> You treat me with a
517,00:31:42.62,00:31:42.62,little respect. >> How am I not respecting you?
518,00:31:43.92,00:31:43.92,">> Wait, wait. >> I haven't disrespected one"
519,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,word and you're calling me stupid?
520,00:31:47.12,00:31:47.12,>> Just relax. >> Go over there and help Shane
521,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,with the fire and we'll talk. Seriously.
522,00:31:52.17,00:31:52.17,"Because look at you right now. Go ahead, go with Shane right"
523,00:31:55.08,00:31:55.08,now with the fire. >> Did you see that?
524,00:31:57.29,00:31:57.29,">> Yeah. >> For the first time ever,"
525,00:32:00.58,00:32:00.58,"Aras really, like, freaked me out."
526,00:32:04.17,00:32:04.17,I think the boys just want to cover their ass and they want
527,00:32:05.83,00:32:05.83,to get the girls off. That's exactly why he was so
528,00:32:07.88,00:32:07.88,aggressive about it. >> I've never seen him like
529,00:32:09.46,00:32:09.46,"that. >> He was, like, psycho."
530,00:32:11.38,00:32:11.38,The hidden immunity idol has shaken things up.
531,00:32:14.46,00:32:14.46,"I mean I want to stay loyal, but if Austin does have the hidden"
532,00:32:17.08,00:32:17.08,"immunity idol, then if Aras goes, well, I'm sorry but Aras"
533,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,needs to be voted off at some point.
534,00:32:28.42,00:32:28.42,>> Courtney has not displayed one bit of intelligence since
535,00:32:31.58,00:32:31.58,she's been out here and it's interesting that the two Casaya
536,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,guys are not being protected by their tribe.
537,00:32:38.46,00:32:38.46,Either it's shortsightedness or they don't mind losing one of
538,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,us. >> Why? 
539,00:33:21.00,00:33:21.00,">> I have been on Exile Island for two days, I come back and,"
540,00:33:24.04,00:33:24.04,"bam, everybody's going crazy. Austin and Terry said that I"
541,00:33:29.17,00:33:29.17,was on the top of the line to get knocked off.
542,00:33:31.75,00:33:31.75,And then Terry promised me that he would give me the immunity
543,00:33:33.71,00:33:33.71,idol to get me to flop to be with them.
544,00:33:40.21,00:33:40.21,It's tempting. I don't know if I trust Aras.
545,00:33:44.08,00:33:44.08,So I have a lot of power. The ball's in my hand.
546,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,I could actually transform this game into a whole new thing and
547,00:33:50.71,00:33:50.71,maybe there's going to be somebody different going home
548,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,than everybody thinks. >> I do not agree.
549,00:34:07.54,00:34:07.54,">> We'll see what happens >> Basically, we're playing a"
550,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,shell game. Where's the ball?
551,00:34:13.00,00:34:13.00,Under which shell? And Casaya is divided on the
552,00:34:15.54,00:34:15.54,vote. >> Great.
553,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,>> So I absolutely feel at risk and I'm crossing my fingers and
554,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,just hoping that I don't get a whammy.
555,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,">> PROBST: Hello, everybody. >> Hey."
556,00:34:49.88,00:34:49.88,>> Hey. >> PROBST: Let's start with the
557,00:34:51.71,00:34:51.71,"reward challenge. Aras, it was clear even to me"
558,00:34:53.79,00:34:53.79,that even though you and Danielle were on separate
559,00:34:56.08,00:34:56.08,"teams, you guys were working together."
560,00:34:58.12,00:34:58.12,>> I feel like the team of men had a bit of an advantage and
561,00:35:00.79,00:35:00.79,"so I looked at my group and said ""Let's put all our coconuts in"
562,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,"the men's boat and hopefully, we can get the women to do the"
563,00:35:06.29,00:35:06.29,"same,"" which would give us both an equal shot at winning it."
564,00:35:09.54,00:35:09.54,">> Actually, it was really a good plan for Aras because we"
565,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,helped him stop the men and helped him win.
566,00:35:16.71,00:35:16.71,"Sorry, Aras. >> PROBST: Aras, it's tough to"
567,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,put yourself on a limb like that because you expose
568,00:35:21.88,00:35:21.88,yourself. >> It definitely weighs on my
569,00:35:23.42,00:35:23.42,"mind, Jeff. Coming here tonight I know that"
570,00:35:25.88,00:35:25.88,"if an immunity idol gets played, I could easily be going"
571,00:35:28.04,00:35:28.04,"home tonight. >> PROBST: So while Sally,"
572,00:35:31.38,00:35:31.38,"Bruce, and Aras are having breakfast, Danielle and Austin"
573,00:35:36.75,00:35:36.75,"are in hell. Austin, after those two days on"
574,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,"Exile Island, is it too soon to say something like that builds"
575,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,character? Do you need time away from it?
576,00:35:46.12,00:35:46.12,">> When I look back upon my entire Survivor experience,"
577,00:35:48.79,00:35:48.79,"even if I win a million dollars, the first thing I'm"
578,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,going to remember are those two nights.
579,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,I have never had a more character-building trying time
580,00:35:58.12,00:35:58.12,"in my whole life. >> PROBST: Danielle, when"
581,00:36:01.21,00:36:01.21,"you're in a situation like that and you're with a stranger, do"
582,00:36:04.54,00:36:04.54,all those things go away and do suddenly the two of you just
583,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,bond together? >> Absolutely.
584,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,I mean Austin and I got to know each other so much better than I
585,00:36:12.04,00:36:12.04,did before we had that little moment together.
586,00:36:15.04,00:36:15.04,It was a great bonding experience and I'm just so
587,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,proud of myself that I came out of there alive and I was
588,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,"strong, and same with Austin. >> PROBST: Change of topic."
589,00:36:24.88,00:36:24.88,"Cirie, so how is this group getting along now that you're"
590,00:36:27.12,00:36:27.12,one tribe and the numbers are whittling and the tension
591,00:36:29.92,00:36:29.92,starts to mount? >> I think we get along fine
592,00:36:33.00,00:36:33.00,until Tribal Council. When it's the day for Tribal
593,00:36:37.29,00:36:37.29,"Council, you see La Mina here and Casaya here and everyone's"
594,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,"basically scrambling. >> PROBST: Courtney, does it go"
595,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,through your head that somebody in this group of six might be
596,00:36:48.21,00:36:48.21,looking ahead and thinking there's a time for me to move
597,00:36:51.33,00:36:51.33,and it's before we get to six? >> I think anyone that's
598,00:36:55.12,00:36:55.12,"playing this game, if they're playing it right, they're going"
599,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,to be looking ahead. And there's so many unknown
600,00:37:01.75,00:37:01.75,"variables. >> And again, the whole"
601,00:37:03.96,00:37:03.96,immunity idol thing could pop up at any time and one of us
602,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,"could go home. >> PROBST: Danielle, how do you"
603,00:37:11.58,00:37:11.58,"navigate knowing that as the numbers dwindle, people are"
604,00:37:14.29,00:37:14.29,"going to realize ""I'm on the bottom and I've got to make a"
605,00:37:17.21,00:37:17.21,"move."" >> It's very difficult."
606,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,I go with my basic gut instincts.
607,00:37:22.42,00:37:22.42,"Whatever it tells me what I feel is right inside, I mean,"
608,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,"that's the move that I make. >> PROBST: Bruce, does it go"
609,00:37:28.79,00:37:28.79,"through your head, maybe I'm #6? >> It's been going through my"
610,00:37:32.88,00:37:32.88,head the entire time. They could just be setting me
611,00:37:35.58,00:37:35.58,"up for the fall. Right now, I appreciate the six"
612,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,"I'm with. But in the back of my mind, I"
613,00:37:42.25,00:37:42.25,feel that I could be the first to go.
614,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,">> PROBST: Shane, how much of your time is spent thinking"
615,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"about how tight is my six? >> If someone flops now, it's"
616,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,still five-four. So two people now have to flop
617,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,from the six. Which I would find...
618,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,"it would be... I would be stunned at one,"
619,00:38:02.12,00:38:02.12,but it's impossible that two of us would do it.
620,00:38:06.92,00:38:06.92,>> PROBST: Okay. Terry has the individual
621,00:38:09.04,00:38:09.04,immunity necklace. >> I'll be holding on to it.
622,00:38:12.29,00:38:12.29,">> PROBST: In addition, at this point lots of people could have"
623,00:38:14.46,00:38:14.46,"found the hidden immunity idol. If it comes into play, you'll"
624,00:38:17.62,00:38:17.62,present it to me after the vote. Whoever has it is immune and
625,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,the person with the next highest numbers of votes is out.
626,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,"It is time to vote. Austin, you're up."
627,00:38:34.88,00:38:34.88," >> Best of luck to you, buddy.  >> You are my biggest threat."
628,00:39:22.42,00:39:22.42, >> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
629,00:39:34.12,00:39:34.12,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
630,00:39:36.38,00:39:36.38,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
631,00:39:38.29,00:39:38.29,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
632,00:39:42.17,00:39:42.17,First vote: Aras. Aras.
633,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,Two votes Aras. Austin.
634,00:39:55.33,00:39:55.33,"Two votes Aras, one vote Austin. Aras."
635,00:40:00.62,00:40:00.62,"That's three votes Aras, one vote Austin."
636,00:40:05.21,00:40:05.21,"Austin. Three votes Aras,"
637,00:40:07.79,00:40:07.79,two votes Austin. Austin.
638,00:40:12.46,00:40:12.46,"That's three votes Austin, three votes Aras."
639,00:40:17.62,00:40:17.62,"Austin, that's four votes Austin three votes Aras."
640,00:40:24.12,00:40:24.12,"Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Exile Island, first"
641,00:40:27.12,00:40:27.12,member of our jury: Austin. That's enough votes.
642,00:40:30.79,00:40:30.79,"Unless you have the immunity idol, you need to bring me your"
643,00:40:32.71,00:40:32.71,torch.  >> Good luck.
644,00:40:56.96,00:40:56.96,">> PROBST: Austin, the tribe has spoken."
645,00:41:00.21,00:41:00.21,">> Bye, guys. >> PROBST: Time for you to go."
646,00:41:03.00,00:41:03.00,">> Later, man. >> PROBST: Well, from this "
647,00:41:15.96,00:41:15.96,"point forward, the power in this game begins to shift from those"
648,00:41:18.25,00:41:18.25,of you still in the game to the people on the jury.
649,00:41:21.88,00:41:21.88,You are now voting people out that you need to vote for you
650,00:41:24.88,00:41:24.88,in order to win the million dollars.
651,00:41:27.04,00:41:27.04,Just one of the things that makes Survivor so much fun.
652,00:41:30.00,00:41:30.00,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

660,00:41:56.25,00:41:56.25,irritates his tribe mates. >> Maybe he'll break his arm or
661,00:41:58.58,00:41:58.58,something. >> PROBST: A twist at the
662,00:42:00.92,00:42:00.92,immunity challenge divides the confident from the concerned.
663,00:42:04.92,00:42:04.92,And Shane has a medical question for the nurse.

666,00:42:19.08,00:42:19.08,ever gone through in my life. It was very difficult for me to
667,00:42:22.29,00:42:22.29,negotiate the line between integrity and playing the game
668,00:42:25.25,00:42:25.25,of Survivor. I'm incredibly proud to have
