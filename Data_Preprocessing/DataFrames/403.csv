54,00:03:39.40,00:03:39.40,"So I don't know what kind ofcommunication they want, maybe"
55,00:03:42.17,00:03:42.17,"telecommunication, I don't know.>> You got upset the other day"

80,00:05:04.83,00:05:04.83,place.The wind was up.
81,00:05:05.93,00:05:05.93,It was coming in from both sidesof the shelter.
82,00:05:08.07,00:05:08.07,I think everybody basically justfroze their butts off.
83,00:05:11.40,00:05:11.40,">> We don't have blankets, soit's cold at night."
84,00:05:14.37,00:05:14.37,Blankets make all the differencein the world.

91,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,">> If you can bring four fronds,green fronds, I'd like to make"
92,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,sort of just a light doorway tostop the wind.
93,00:05:46.73,00:05:46.73,>> All right.Being with Kathy the first few
94,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,"days was rough, but she hasturned around 100% and now I"
95,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,love it.>> I switched it around.
96,00:05:54.23,00:05:54.23,I'm also playing a littlelow-key.

105,00:06:22.70,00:06:22.70,just reminds me of my twodaughters at home.
106,00:06:26.30,00:06:26.30,>> Do I look tough?>> They look like antlers.
107,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,>> Every single person on thistribe calls me Sweet Pea.

109,00:06:36.07,00:06:36.07,of anybody on the whole entireteam.
110,00:06:38.07,00:06:38.07,>> Be careful.That's a sharp one right there.
111,00:06:39.83,00:06:39.83,">> All right, I'll be all right.He's like the father figure of"
112,00:06:42.30,00:06:42.30,the group.>> They just call me Pappy.
113,00:06:44.40,00:06:44.40,So I think that's probably thename I'm known now is Pappy.
114,00:06:48.13,00:06:48.13,>> He's always smiling andwinking and just giving tons and
115,00:06:51.53,00:06:51.53,"tons of love.I mean, of anybody on the whole"
116,00:06:53.70,00:06:53.70,"team that I would have thetoughest time voting off, it"
117,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,would definitely be him.>> I landed right on the top of
118,00:07:19.03,00:07:19.03,"a sea urchin, and embedded about12 sea urchin needles in my"
119,00:07:22.73,00:07:22.73,fingers.Oh!
120,00:07:23.57,00:07:23.57,"Those suckers went in deep.I got to go back in, and I got"
121,00:07:29.77,00:07:29.77,to get somebody to pee on it.That's supposed to be what
122,00:07:32.77,00:07:32.77,you're supposed to do for thatkind of venomous sting from a
123,00:07:36.00,00:07:36.00,sea urchin is to urinate on it.It's supposed to help with the
124,00:07:39.10,00:07:39.10,swelling and the pain.I need somebody who has to pee.
125,00:07:44.57,00:07:44.57,I need somebody who can pee onmy hand!
126,00:07:49.23,00:07:49.23,Somebody can pee?Somebody have to go to the
127,00:07:51.90,00:07:51.90,bathroom?>> Paschal went out to try to
128,00:07:54.43,00:07:54.43,pee.He did that performance
129,00:07:56.27,00:07:56.27,"anxiety thing, I think.So it was, it was just good"
130,00:08:00.33,00:08:00.33,timing that I had to go to thebathroom.
131,00:08:03.80,00:08:03.80,"This is gross, but...>> I don't care."
132,00:08:05.10,00:08:05.10,I don't care.Just pee on it.
133,00:08:06.07,00:08:06.07,You'll have to put it underthere.
134,00:08:07.23,00:08:07.23,">> Okay, okay, I don't knowwhere my hand is."
135,00:08:08.77,00:08:08.77,>> Just get it under there.>> Okay.
136,00:08:10.00,00:08:10.00,"Okay.I mean, that could have been"
137,00:08:11.63,00:08:11.63,like peroxide as far as I wasconcerned.
138,00:08:13.43,00:08:13.43,I didn't think of it being weirdthat she was squatting down and
139,00:08:16.00,00:08:16.00,I had my hand between her legs.>> Good thing you had to go to
140,00:08:18.40,00:08:18.40,the bathroom.(laughing)
141,00:08:20.90,00:08:20.90,"I mean, it was like do what ittakes to make it feel good, I"

144,00:08:29.00,00:08:29.00,"got very embarrassed, but itmade me feel good."
145,00:08:31.70,00:08:31.70,At least I performed in the callof duty.
146,00:08:36.47,00:08:36.47,">> Good morning, good morning,y'all."

195,00:11:05.13,00:11:05.13,"Yep.Gosh, this sand is hot."
196,00:11:12.63,00:11:12.63,">> Oh, to what do we owe thishonor?"
197,00:11:18.20,00:11:18.20,>> PROBST: I come bearingsupplies for your next

209,00:12:34.77,00:12:34.77,between my shoe and my foot andjust sliced up my toe nicely.
210,00:12:39.57,00:12:39.57,">> It's an injury day.>> It's pretty deep right there,"
211,00:12:45.93,00:12:45.93,right at the toe.Are you going to start crying
212,00:12:48.20,00:12:48.20,like I did?>> No.
213,00:12:49.53,00:12:49.53,">> Fine, don't.>> All the tattoos on my body,"

216,00:12:57.17,00:12:57.17,>> Do what you got to do.>> Take a deep breath because
217,00:12:59.53,00:12:59.53,"I'm going to scrub it.Get ready, one, two, three."
218,00:13:03.47,00:13:03.47,Make sure we get all the junkout of there.
219,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,"Okay, okay, okay.That's good."
220,00:13:09.43,00:13:09.43,Are you okay?>> I'm okay.
221,00:13:13.20,00:13:13.20,>> Get me the knife.I am a registered nurse and
222,00:13:16.73,00:13:16.73,everyone has confidence that Iknow what I'm doing and I know
223,00:13:20.20,00:13:20.20,what I'm looking for in casesomething bad should happen.
224,00:13:22.87,00:13:22.87,"Okay, this might hurt a littlebit."
225,00:13:24.63,00:13:24.63,You'll be okay.I'm just doing a little cutting
226,00:13:27.20,00:13:27.20,here.Just that piece of skin.
227,00:13:33.17,00:13:33.17,">> Nice work, butcher.Good job."
228,00:13:36.80,00:13:36.80,">> It's pain, you know, you gotto deal with it."
229,00:13:39.07,00:13:39.07,It's only pain.You know.
230,00:13:40.73,00:13:40.73,"Pain is easy.Life is hard, man."

233,00:13:48.43,00:13:48.43,>> I got nine more.>> You're the man!
234,00:14:08.60,00:14:08.60,">> Get a rope over the pile,and let's lay out the bamboo."
235,00:14:11.50,00:14:11.50,We are building basically apontoon boat.
236,00:14:15.10,00:14:15.10,Watch your toes.All the cargo goes on the
237,00:14:18.77,00:14:18.77,"platform in the center, andthree rowers on each side."
238,00:14:22.40,00:14:22.40,"Genius, if I say so myself.The raft was a really fun"
239,00:14:27.33,00:14:27.33,project.Let's do this one first and that
240,00:14:30.00,00:14:30.00,one second.>> Rob and Gabriel were working
241,00:14:32.63,00:14:32.63,"on the raft, and Gabriel had areally good plan."
242,00:14:35.70,00:14:35.70,It was sort of like a Kon-Tikideal.
243,00:14:38.53,00:14:38.53,">> You want it here?>> Yeah, I want I there."
244,00:14:41.63,00:14:41.63,">> Okay, my toe is bleeding orfalling off, I'm not going to"
245,00:14:44.30,00:14:44.30,let my teammates down.>> That's good.
246,00:14:46.30,00:14:46.30,">> Rob, are you all right towalk around, man?"
247,00:14:49.30,00:14:49.30,">> Yeah, don't worry about it.Just call me hop-a-long."
248,00:14:51.67,00:14:51.67,"You know, it's not just fun andgames outs here."
249,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,"You know, you got to keep onsurviving, and you got to keep"
250,00:14:56.30,00:14:56.30,on working to help the group.Two heads are definitely better
251,00:14:59.13,00:14:59.13,"than one, especially when you'reout here."
252,00:15:01.23,00:15:01.23,You need every idea you can getyour hands on.
253,00:15:04.27,00:15:04.27,">> Oh, that's good!>> Locked on, my brother."
254,00:15:06.73,00:15:06.73,">> Good, Rob.As far as a team, I don't think"
255,00:15:09.33,00:15:09.33,we'll be up against anythinglike what we've got going on
256,00:15:12.70,00:15:12.70,"here.This is, this is a really cool"
257,00:15:14.77,00:15:14.77,"craft.Just getting to make this,"
258,00:15:16.60,00:15:16.60,"this has been an absolute blast.>> Way to go, guys!"
259,00:15:19.63,00:15:19.63,>> We're all just having areally fun time out here.
260,00:15:22.77,00:15:22.77,We'd love to win some morechallenges.
261,00:15:32.00,00:15:32.00,">> Get a really big raft, andit's going to be tough to"
262,00:15:35.13,00:15:35.13,"maneuver.>> The more of this we use, the"
263,00:15:37.43,00:15:37.43,more buoyant it is.>> Yeah.
264,00:15:39.03,00:15:39.03,>> And the more weight we cancarry without being dragged in
265,00:15:41.47,00:15:41.47,the water.>> What if we have to lift the
266,00:15:43.87,00:15:43.87,raft and carry it somewhereafter?
267,00:15:46.03,00:15:46.03,>> A raft is for the water.>> He said we got to carry
268,00:15:48.57,00:15:48.57,"stuff.So the less buoyancy we have,"
269,00:15:50.23,00:15:50.23,the less weight we can carry.>> Remember the last time with
270,00:15:53.07,00:15:53.07,"the canoe, and then we had tocarry it up the rocks."
271,00:15:55.53,00:15:55.53,>> We might have a finish linein the water.
272,00:15:57.60,00:15:57.60,>> The morning after the tribalcouncil after we had the big
273,00:16:00.87,00:16:00.87,"blowout at the campfire, youknow, everyone seems like, ""Hey,"
274,00:16:04.13,00:16:04.13,"a whole new beginning.""There's been a rebirth."
275,00:16:06.67,00:16:06.67,"Everything, you know, we're goodto go now."
276,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,"To me, it didn't really seemthat clear."
277,00:16:25.37,00:16:25.37,">> Sean, you got a couple morelong ones?"
278,00:16:27.47,00:16:27.47,How many is this?It wasn't a problem with Hunter
279,00:16:29.70,00:16:29.70,stepping up.Take the lead.
280,00:16:30.80,00:16:30.80,I don't have a problem with himleading.
281,00:16:32.47,00:16:32.47,I just have a problem withwhomever.
282,00:16:34.13,00:16:34.13,"I don't like overconfidence whenit comes, when I'm in your tribe"
283,00:16:37.23,00:16:37.23,or I'm on your team.So I refuse to sit back and
284,00:16:39.60,00:16:39.60,watch the golden boy just smileand make suggestions and look
285,00:16:42.70,00:16:42.70,like the leader and people notknow that he's here to play a
286,00:16:45.77,00:16:45.77,"game.>> Tie it around the frame,"
287,00:16:49.97,00:16:49.97,right?>> Yeah.
288,00:16:56.57,00:16:56.57,">> It's weird.You might not believe it, but I"
289,00:16:59.70,00:16:59.70,am totally 100% like Hunterwithout a doubt.
290,00:17:02.83,00:17:02.83,I would not let it show out herefor the life of me because I
291,00:17:07.07,00:17:07.07,know that people are not goingto take kindly to that type of a
292,00:17:11.03,00:17:11.03,atmosphere.Everybody wants to think that
293,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,they're the big man.So the smart guy will sit back
294,00:17:16.23,00:17:16.23,"and let everybody step up to bethe big man, and then in the end"
295,00:17:20.80,00:17:20.80,"just bank in on their mistakes.>> When they see this, they're"
296,00:17:25.73,00:17:25.73,"going to give us jobs down atthe shipyard, making boats."
297,00:17:36.70,00:17:36.70,">> One, two, three pieces acrossand then the rest..."
298,00:17:39.37,00:17:39.37,>> Everything gets wrapped goodtwice.
299,00:17:42.37,00:17:42.37,">> A bunch of us were out, youknow, gathering shells today."
300,00:17:45.07,00:17:45.07,John actually stuck his handunderneath a rock and an eel bit
301,00:17:49.70,00:17:49.70,"it.>> Oh, my God."
302,00:17:51.03,00:17:51.03,>> He got bit by an eel.Not a very good day at sea.
303,00:17:55.77,00:17:55.77,>> Just lacerated the undersideof my finger.
304,00:17:58.93,00:17:58.93,"Really, I mean, just ripped itopen in just jagged shreds and"
305,00:18:04.07,00:18:04.07,it cracked my fingernail almostto the bed.
306,00:18:08.00,00:18:08.00,">> Damn, that's big.Right down the center."
307,00:18:11.57,00:18:11.57,>> Yeah.>> Does it hurt real bad?
308,00:18:13.90,00:18:13.90,">> Worse than the last time.>> Good Lord, what is going on?"
309,00:18:17.77,00:18:17.77,">> He was panicked.I mean, he was on the verge of"
310,00:18:20.47,00:18:20.47,tears.He was in pain.
311,00:18:22.07,00:18:22.07,"It was obvious.>> Okay, I'm feeling a little"
312,00:18:24.50,00:18:24.50,dizzy.I'm going to sit down.
313,00:18:25.60,00:18:25.60,">> Okay, why don't you sit down?>> All right."
314,00:18:27.43,00:18:27.43,I'm just going to sit on therock.
315,00:18:28.77,00:18:28.77,Hold on.It's deep.
316,00:18:30.00,00:18:30.00,It's like a crushing-typeinjury.
317,00:18:32.93,00:18:32.93,I was scared.If my energy and what I'm
318,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13,"contributing to the tribediminishes, then that may put me"
319,00:18:40.73,00:18:40.73,at risk.And that just kind of hit me
320,00:18:43.20,00:18:43.20,really hard.>> Everything can change in a
321,00:18:46.03,00:18:46.03,heartbeat.Here John has gotten hurt twice
322,00:18:49.27,00:18:49.27,today.Things change just like that out

337,00:20:09.20,00:20:09.20,>> Take a bath.>> The constant complaining
338,00:20:15.57,00:20:15.57,about food and things being wetand dirty is driving me nuts.
339,00:20:21.37,00:20:21.37,"And I don't say anything, butit's like, what do you expect?"
340,00:20:25.90,00:20:25.90,I mean we're not at aRitz-Carlton.

352,00:21:01.33,00:21:01.33,the raft will tip and thingswill slide off if we already
353,00:21:03.57,00:21:03.57,picked them up.If we do get them aboard we want
354,00:21:06.17,00:21:06.17,to try and stick them in thatone little trough where we don't

568,00:33:31.63,00:33:31.63,You guys can head back to campthis way.
569,00:33:33.90,00:33:33.90,I'll see you in a little bit.>> You guys did so good.
570,00:33:55.50,00:33:55.50,">> Ooh, are you okay?>> I'm good."
571,00:33:59.80,00:33:59.80,>> It feels like crap going tothe third straight tribal
572,00:34:02.37,00:34:02.37,"council.It's the worst feeling that,"
573,00:34:04.30,00:34:04.30,"that, since I've gotten here.You know, this could be my last"
574,00:34:07.87,00:34:07.87,"night, or it could be, you know,we go to tribal council again"
575,00:34:11.23,00:34:11.23,today and you might have to goin three days again.
576,00:34:13.67,00:34:13.67,You know?You just don't ever know.
577,00:34:15.47,00:34:15.47,It's just a difficult situation.It's very difficult.
578,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33,">> One way or another, we've gotto, it's like, you've got to put"
579,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,your trust in somebody.If Rob wants a strong team to
580,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,"help him out, then...he'd be stupid to try and get"
581,00:34:36.73,00:34:36.73,rid of you or me.So he may go after Sean.
582,00:34:44.77,00:34:44.77,I think we need to go after Seantonight.
583,00:34:49.30,00:34:49.30,">> To be honest with you, myfirst impression of Sean is that"
584,00:34:54.33,00:34:54.33,"he was just like a lazyloudmouth, this and that, all"
585,00:34:56.83,00:34:56.83,for the drama.But I don't really not like him.
586,00:35:00.30,00:35:00.30,I think he's a pretty goodperson.
587,00:35:04.37,00:35:04.37,"I don't know.>> I'm definitely leaning, I"
588,00:35:08.57,00:35:08.57,think in one direction.>> That makes me think.
589,00:35:13.93,00:35:13.93,"See, here's the thing.Me and you are the one that's"
590,00:35:17.87,00:35:17.87,"making the decision.>> Yeah, and then we just pass"
591,00:35:20.10,00:35:20.10,it on.>> We tell the girls.
592,00:35:21.30,00:35:21.30,>> It's important for me to havepeople on my team that are going
593,00:35:24.37,00:35:24.37,to do what I tell them to do andnot know that I'm telling them
594,00:35:27.37,00:35:27.37,"to do it.>> I looked on the boat now, and"
595,00:35:32.20,00:35:32.20,"I looked over at your girl, alot of times she's just like,"
596,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40,"cheer leading you on, man.I wanted to ask you about how"
597,00:35:38.07,00:35:38.07,"you feel about her specifically.Not necessarily in voting, but"
598,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,are you catching feelings forher?
599,00:35:42.07,00:35:42.07,">> Oh, no.No."
600,00:35:43.07,00:35:43.07,">> No?I don't know, man."
601,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,">> No, no, no.I'm just playing the game, man."
602,00:35:48.43,00:35:48.43,>> The game always keeps youthinking.
603,00:35:51.27,00:35:51.27,It really does.It doesn't matter if my team is
604,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,"stronger, physically or evenstronger mentally."
605,00:36:00.30,00:36:00.30,But just that they obey.Always think about your next
606,00:36:06.03,00:36:06.03,"move.As it is right now, our team's"
607,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,not that strong.>> That's why I think...
608,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,>> Sean is not that good in thewater.
609,00:36:13.97,00:36:13.97,He's not that good at all.Are you okay?
610,00:36:16.53,00:36:16.53,">> Oh, yeah, I'm fine.You don't have to worry about"
611,00:36:20.37,00:36:20.37,"me.Just do what you got to do, you"
612,00:36:22.07,00:36:22.07,know.>> It's all in how smart these
613,00:36:23.77,00:36:23.77,people are.If they realize if they need
614,00:36:26.30,00:36:26.30,"you, that's what will keep themloyal."
615,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,"Right?Fear, basically."
616,00:36:34.13,00:36:34.13,"It's a tough principle,but fear keeps people loyal."
617,00:36:38.23,00:36:38.23,"If they're afraid they havesomething to lose, then they'll"
618,00:36:41.47,00:36:41.47,do what they tell you to do.That's straight out of The
619,00:36:44.53,00:36:44.53, Godfather.That's true.
620,00:37:14.87,00:37:14.87,">> PROBST: So, your thirdstraight tribal council after"
621,00:37:18.83,00:37:18.83,five straight losses inchallenges.
622,00:37:21.37,00:37:21.37,"Everybody getting along still,Sarah?"
623,00:37:23.53,00:37:23.53,">> Yeah, actually, the pastcouple days ever since we were"
624,00:37:25.90,00:37:25.90,here last we all had it out whenwe got home and cleared the
625,00:37:28.37,00:37:28.37,"slate, we've gotten along reallygood since then."
626,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,">> PROBST: Hunter, is Rotu justa stronger tribe or smarter or"
627,00:37:34.27,00:37:34.27,working better together?>> I'm not sure because I'm not
628,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,"over there, so I don't know.They may be working better"
629,00:37:41.10,00:37:41.10,together.I think whatever happens here
630,00:37:43.40,00:37:43.40,tonight that we're probablygoing to have to go back and
631,00:37:46.47,00:37:46.47,rebuild and rethink from thebasics.
632,00:37:49.20,00:37:49.20,"You know, start with everythingaround camp and just rebuild"
633,00:37:53.00,00:37:53.00,"that team effort, whoever thefive may be that go back."
634,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,">> PROBST: Rob, are yousurprised at the inability of"
635,00:37:59.27,00:37:59.27,this tribe to win a singlechallenge yet?
636,00:38:01.97,00:38:01.97,>> I really don't think that thetribe is unable to win.
637,00:38:05.60,00:38:05.60,I really do believe that eachchallenge we had has been very
638,00:38:10.60,00:38:10.60,"close, and I think it's just badluck."
639,00:38:13.77,00:38:13.77,We just seem to be one stepbehind right now.
640,00:38:17.27,00:38:17.27,"And whatever it's going to taketo get us to that next level,"
641,00:38:20.30,00:38:20.30,"that's what we need to find.>> PROBST: V, how about you in"
642,00:38:22.97,00:38:22.97,"terms of looking down the road,not only do you not have food,"
643,00:38:25.97,00:38:25.97,you're coming here and losinganother member.
644,00:38:28.27,00:38:28.27,Is attrition slowly going tojust wear this tribe down to
645,00:38:30.57,00:38:30.57,where you have no chance?>> I think at some point it
646,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,"probably will weigh heavily oneach individual, but like all"
647,00:38:37.53,00:38:37.53,"things, we've got to go deeperinside ourselves if we really"
648,00:38:40.93,00:38:40.93,"want to win, and my innerstrength comes from the Lord"
649,00:38:44.03,00:38:44.03,"Jesus Christ, and somebody elsemay come from Buddha, somebody"
650,00:38:46.83,00:38:46.83,else may just come from lookingat the stars.
651,00:38:48.87,00:38:48.87,So everybody has to find thatdeep something that's rooted in
652,00:38:53.33,00:38:53.33,"them to bring it out.>> PROBST: Sean, thinking back"
653,00:38:56.73,00:38:56.73,"to day one, clean slate,anything was possible."
654,00:38:59.53,00:38:59.53,Surprised to find that you'venow been here three times and
655,00:39:02.70,00:39:02.70,you guys haven't won yet.Does that shock you?
656,00:39:04.73,00:39:04.73,">> Quite frankly, I'm gettingsick of coming back here, man."
657,00:39:07.67,00:39:07.67,I'm getting sick of losing.I've never lost this much in my
658,00:39:10.77,00:39:10.77,life.I don't think it's any fault of
659,00:39:12.77,00:39:12.77,"anybody on this team.Like Rob said, it could be bad"
660,00:39:15.77,00:39:15.77,"luck, we just a misstep here, amisstep there, but I know, me"
661,00:39:19.37,00:39:19.37,"personally, it's wearing medown."
