141,00:07:16.58,00:07:16.58,the final two with Ozzy.He's playing straight up game

175,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67,I'm a huge threat.So I'd say winning immunity is

300,00:20:32.12,00:20:32.12,to pull it out.Now the competition is
301,00:20:34.58,00:20:34.58,ourselves.And I'm looking at Yul as my
302,00:20:36.96,00:20:36.96,"competition, basically, sohopefully I'll be able to win"
303,00:20:41.42,00:20:41.42,the next two and secure my spotdefinitely in the top two.
304,00:20:44.46,00:20:44.46,I can't believe it.>> Wow.

308,00:20:57.21,00:20:57.21,So I've maneuvered myself into avery good position.
309,00:21:00.79,00:21:00.79,But now it's a different ballgame.
310,00:21:03.21,00:21:03.21,I'm hoping it will be relativelyclean.
311,00:21:04.83,00:21:04.83,"But, you know, if it just getsugly then we'll see what"
312,00:21:06.50,00:21:06.50,"happens.Right now with Aitu, Yul is in"
313,00:21:22.38,00:21:22.38,"control of the game.You know, he's been in control"
314,00:21:25.04,00:21:25.04,for a while.It bothers me.
315,00:21:27.83,00:21:27.83,So I would like to get the idolout of Yul's hands just to stir
316,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,it up right before I go home.I wanted to see if you and
317,00:21:54.33,00:21:54.33,"Sundra and me wanted to votejust to get it out, and then"
318,00:21:56.75,00:21:56.75,"they'll vote for me.>> Adam asked me if, you know, I"
319,00:22:02.75,00:22:02.75,wanted to vote against Yul andsee if Sundra would vote against
320,00:22:05.21,00:22:05.21,Yul to bring the idol out.He's trying to place little
321,00:22:08.21,00:22:08.21,seeds of doubt in people's mindsto shake things up.
322,00:22:11.79,00:22:11.79,So it's just weird thoughts andideas floating around camp.
323,00:22:15.75,00:22:15.75,"And it could go a lot of ways,really."
324,00:22:26.79,00:22:26.79,">> You can only use it from fourto three, and if you don't get"
325,00:22:28.62,00:22:28.62,"out tonight, then next tribalcouncil, if he needs it, he'll"
326,00:22:30.42,00:22:30.42,"use it.He's guaranteed top three, Yul"
327,00:22:32.67,00:22:32.67,is.>> There's this conflicting side
328,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,"of me where I'm like, ""Hey, Iwant a shot at that final two,"
329,00:22:42.42,00:22:42.42,"and Yul's going to make itreally hard."""
330,00:22:44.71,00:22:44.71,"So of course there's thatconflict, you know?"
331,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,"We're still playing a game, andwe have to make strategic moves."
332,00:22:50.71,00:22:50.71,">> It's going to be interestingfrom this point on, though."
333,00:22:53.04,00:22:53.04,I want to see if this last-ditcheffort with Ozzy and Sundra will
334,00:22:59.12,00:22:59.12,work.And hopefully something will
335,00:23:02.88,00:23:02.88,come out of it.>> Right now I'm still here.
336,00:23:05.29,00:23:05.29,And who knows what's in store?>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

341,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,>> No.No.
342,00:23:59.12,00:23:59.12,"I mean, I got the necklace, sothat was the only thing really"
343,00:24:01.50,00:24:01.50,"that could have changed.>> PROBST: So just so I'm clear,"
344,00:24:03.92,00:24:03.92,"Adam's done.>> Yes, Jeff, I think I'm done."
345,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,"You know, I had my opportunity,and I came up short."
346,00:24:09.71,00:24:09.71,"And these four aren't budging.They've got blinders on, and"

355,00:24:36.38,00:24:36.38,But I think that definitelywe're going to have a little bit
356,00:24:38.54,00:24:38.54,of a stronger fight.>> PROBST: That's an interesting

376,00:25:33.04,00:25:33.04,because that would give themeach an even shot instead of Yul
377,00:25:37.08,00:25:37.08,"having the advantage.>> PROBST: So Becky, tell me why"
378,00:25:39.25,00:25:39.25,it doesn't hurt to you leave itin the game.
379,00:25:42.17,00:25:42.17,"If Yul leaves here tonight withit, he's fine at the next vote."
380,00:25:45.12,00:25:45.12,Ozzy hasn't lost a challenge inI don't know how long.
381,00:25:47.75,00:25:47.75,"So if the results are the sameyou, Becky, or you, Sundra going"
382,00:25:50.67,00:25:50.67,"home.>> Personally, for myself, it's"
383,00:25:53.88,00:25:53.88,not the right time for it tocome out.
384,00:25:58.04,00:25:58.04,There is opportunity for it tocome out at the next tribal
385,00:25:59.83,00:25:59.83,"council, and right now it's notthe time."
386,00:26:01.71,00:26:01.71,">> If Yul wins immunity, he canprotect somebody else like"
387,00:26:03.62,00:26:03.62,Becky.So why would Becky want that
388,00:26:05.58,00:26:05.58,idol gone?Think about that.
389,00:26:08.17,00:26:08.17,>> PROBST: You're right.That's another good scenario.
390,00:26:10.21,00:26:10.21,But one of these two isvulnerable.
391,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,>> They've been riding him theentire way here.
392,00:26:14.04,00:26:14.04,So I think they don't want tomess that up.
393,00:26:16.92,00:26:16.92,And they think that if he winsimmunity he'll give it to one of
394,00:26:19.25,00:26:19.25,"them, each of them.Maybe they both think that."
395,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,>> I'd just like to bring up oneother possibility that might
396,00:26:23.79,00:26:23.79,explain why people haven't beenchallenging for the idol.
397,00:26:26.46,00:26:26.46,The reason we got here becausewe've all been really tight.
398,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,There haven't been any cracks inour alliance.
399,00:26:33.12,00:26:33.12,And the four of us have anextremely loyal to the concept
400,00:26:35.33,00:26:35.33,of moving forward together as atribe.
401,00:26:37.38,00:26:37.38,So I think that might alsoexplain why people haven't been
402,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,"angling for it.>> PROBST: With all due respect,"
403,00:26:42.38,00:26:42.38,it's easy to say when you're theone with the idol in your back
404,00:26:44.33,00:26:44.33,"pocket.You can say, ""Let's stay"
405,00:26:46.17,00:26:46.17,"together, guys.""Right?"
406,00:26:48.25,00:26:48.25,">> Yeah.>> PROBST: Well, Adam, it does"

409,00:26:56.71,00:26:56.71,immunity necklace.You want to do something crazy
410,00:26:58.92,00:26:58.92,"with it?>> No, no."
411,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67,"No, no.>> PROBST: You cannot vote for"
412,00:27:02.29,00:27:02.29,Ozzy.Doesn't found like the hidden
413,00:27:04.21,00:27:04.21,immunity idol is coming intoplay.
414,00:27:05.67,00:27:05.67,"If it does, you'll let me know.It is time to vote."
415,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,"Ozzy, you're up.I'll go tally the votes."
416,00:27:53.04,00:27:53.04,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
417,00:27:55.12,00:27:55.12,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
418,00:27:56.92,00:27:56.92,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
419,00:28:00.12,00:28:00.12,"First vote, Adam.Yul."
420,00:28:10.58,00:28:10.58,"One vote Adam, one vote Yul.Adam."
421,00:28:16.54,00:28:16.54,Two votes Adam.One vote Yul.
422,00:28:22.71,00:28:22.71,"16th person voted out, and theeighth member of our jury, Adam."
423,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,That's three.That's enough.
424,00:28:28.42,00:28:28.42,"You need to bring me your torch.Adam, the tribe has spoken."
425,00:28:52.21,00:28:52.21,"Well, the four of you did whatseemed impossible to make it to"
426,00:28:55.25,00:28:55.25,this point.And now the game does change.
427,00:28:58.92,00:28:58.92,"Like it or not, you're going tohave to turn on each other."
428,00:29:01.58,00:29:01.58,It's going to be fun to watch itplay out.
429,00:29:04.04,00:29:04.04,"Grab your torches, head back tocamp."
430,00:29:06.04,00:29:06.04,"Good night.>> Ozzy, Yul, Becky, and Sundra,"
431,00:29:18.46,00:29:18.46,you guys got us good.You knocked us all out.
432,00:29:21.25,00:29:21.25,"You know, you beat us fair andsquare."
433,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,I played the game the best Icould.
434,00:29:25.50,00:29:25.50,Just came up a little short.All I can say is congratulations
435,00:29:27.83,00:29:27.83,"and good luck to all of you.>> Oh, guys, it happened."
436,00:29:52.17,00:29:52.17,>> We did it.>> We did it!

440,00:30:00.38,00:30:00.38,together.>> The fact that we as the Aitu
441,00:30:03.29,00:30:03.29,"four have made it this far, it'san amazing accomplishment."
442,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,It's amazing.We managed to eliminate eight
443,00:30:10.08,00:30:10.08,"Raro members, and we're here,and it's really fulfilling."
444,00:30:16.92,00:30:16.92,>> I am so glad that the winnerof Survivor is going to be from
445,00:30:23.12,00:30:23.12,"a minority community.I think it speaks volumes, that"
446,00:30:25.92,00:30:25.92,oftentimes the strongest teamsare the ones that have a
447,00:30:30.79,00:30:30.79,diversity of perspective andbackgrounds.
448,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,And the fact that we were ableto bond so tightly together and
449,00:30:35.17,00:30:35.17,really kind of succeed undervery long odds I think is a
450,00:30:37.21,00:30:37.21,"great morality tale.>> I woke up before dawn,"
451,00:30:58.25,00:30:58.25,realizing that this is thesecond to last morning.
452,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,"This could be my last morning,you know, if things don't go"
453,00:31:05.08,00:31:05.08,well.I just wanted to enjoy this
454,00:31:07.21,00:31:07.21,"moment and kind of relish theexperience, because to make it"
455,00:31:10.42,00:31:10.42,this far is... it's a feat.I just wanted to get out here
456,00:31:15.21,00:31:15.21,and enjoy this beautifulsunrise.
457,00:31:22.50,00:31:22.50,I'm just focusing my energy andgetting ready for the day.
458,00:31:25.25,00:31:25.25,Getting ready to go out andhopefully win.
459,00:31:27.83,00:31:27.83,Because that's what I got to doat this point.

467,00:31:59.25,00:31:59.25,the game.As you pass by each take a

477,00:32:24.17,00:32:24.17,So we don't know what exactlythat means.
478,00:32:26.29,00:32:26.29,But I'm sure it's going to be adoozy.

482,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,"It was pretty exciting, becauseI think typically three people"
483,00:32:43.54,00:32:43.54,go through that by themselves.And for the Aitu four to be able
484,00:32:46.00,00:32:46.00,"to remember everyone in thisgame, I think that's going to be"
485,00:32:48.46,00:32:48.46,really special for us today.>> Sekou.

487,00:33:09.58,00:33:09.58,with the idea that I was goingto be the leader.
488,00:33:11.75,00:33:11.75,But in situations like these youhave to just step up to the
489,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,plate and do what you need todo.

503,00:34:12.42,00:34:12.42,And you've got to reallyunderstand your surroundings.
504,00:34:14.71,00:34:14.71,"And you cannot rest at any time,because something might be going"

562,00:37:58.83,00:37:58.83,I did.And I kind of shocked myself.
563,00:38:05.46,00:38:05.46,>> I'm a little bit frustratedthat I did get so close and
564,00:38:10.21,00:38:10.21,didn't win it all.But you can't let that haunt
565,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,"you, you know?You can't change the past."
566,00:38:15.50,00:38:15.50,"You know, I learned a tremendousamount about myself."
567,00:38:18.12,00:38:18.12,I'm not afraid to say anythingto anybody.
568,00:38:20.29,00:38:20.29,And that's the type of person Iam.
569,00:38:22.38,00:38:22.38,"So if you really want it, I'mgoing to tell it like it is."
570,00:39:20.29,00:39:20.29,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys.Day 38, and we are down to four."
571,00:39:29.71,00:39:29.71,You guys ready to get to yourfinal immunity challenge?
572,00:39:33.96,00:39:33.96,>> Yes.>> PROBST: First things first.
573,00:39:36.12,00:39:36.12,"Ozzy, I'll take it back again.>> There you go."
574,00:39:39.96,00:39:39.96,>> PROBST: Thanks.Immunity is back up for grabs.
575,00:39:46.25,00:39:46.25,For today's challenge you willbe standing on a small steel
576,00:39:49.62,00:39:49.62,perch situated in the water.Each perch has been individually
577,00:39:54.21,00:39:54.21,proportioned to your foot sizeso everything is equal.
578,00:39:59.12,00:39:59.12,"Every 15 minutes you'll remove asection of the perch, making it"
579,00:40:04.92,00:40:04.92,smaller and more difficult.When you get down to the last
580,00:40:08.54,00:40:08.54,"piece of the perch, you will bestanding on a section that is"
581,00:40:10.42,00:40:10.42,less than half the size of apostcard.
582,00:40:13.12,00:40:13.12,"Last person left standing ontheir perch wins immunity,"
583,00:40:17.25,00:40:17.25,guaranteed a spot in the finalthree.
584,00:40:20.00,00:40:20.00,And the reason that is soimportant is that for the first
585,00:40:22.54,00:40:22.54,time ever final tribal councilwill include not two people but
586,00:40:28.67,00:40:28.67,three.Three people will take part in
587,00:40:33.83,00:40:33.83,that final vote.Three people will be eligible
588,00:40:36.38,00:40:36.38,for the million dollars.This is it.
589,00:40:39.04,00:40:39.04,Ready to get started?>> Yeah!
590,00:40:41.08,00:40:41.08,>> PROBST: Let's head out.This challenge is on.
591,00:41:02.79,00:41:02.79,This first stage will be 15minutes long.
592,00:41:05.75,00:41:05.75,"Calm day, sun is out.Perfect day for a long"
593,00:41:08.75,00:41:08.75,"challenge.Okay, it's time to release the"
594,00:41:35.08,00:41:35.08,first section of perch.Everybody grab the rope.
595,00:41:39.25,00:41:39.25,"Here we go.Three, two, one, release."
596,00:41:43.92,00:41:43.92,Nicely done.It's now time to release the
597,00:42:09.17,00:42:09.17,second section.Here we go.
598,00:42:16.12,00:42:16.12,"Three, two, one, release.>> Oh, cool water."
599,00:42:43.00,00:42:43.00,>> PROBST: Okay.At this time you will remove the
600,00:42:45.29,00:42:45.29,other side.It's going to get a little more
601,00:42:50.25,00:42:50.25,difficult now.Here we go.
602,00:42:52.96,00:42:52.96,"Three, two, one, release.>> Oh, my, gosh."
603,00:42:59.54,00:42:59.54,">> PROBST: And with that, Beckyis the first one out of the"
604,00:43:02.12,00:43:02.12,challenge.We are now down to three.
605,00:43:12.21,00:43:12.21,"Ozzy, Sundra, Yul.Becky's fate is now out of her"
606,00:43:16.12,00:43:16.12,hands.She cannot control her destiny
607,00:43:20.38,00:43:20.38,"in this game.As it stands now, Yul is the"
608,00:43:23.67,00:43:23.67,only person that can guaranteehimself a spot in the final
609,00:43:26.75,00:43:26.75,"three, because he has the hiddenimmunity idol."
610,00:43:29.33,00:43:29.33,If Yul wins immunity that wouldallow him to keep immunity for
611,00:43:32.04,00:43:32.04,himself and give immunity tosomeone else.
612,00:43:57.75,00:43:57.75,"When you remove this last pieceof the perch, you will be left"
613,00:44:00.96,00:44:00.96,with a section to stand on thatis less than half the size of a
614,00:44:04.62,00:44:04.62,postcard.Here we go.
615,00:44:08.25,00:44:08.25,"Three, two, one, release.Ozzy recovers from a near fall."
616,00:44:24.17,00:44:24.17,Sundra balancing on one footusing just the ball of her other
617,00:44:28.25,00:44:28.25,foot.Yul doing very well in his
618,00:44:30.25,00:44:30.25,squat.Three very different strategies.
619,00:44:43.46,00:44:43.46,Ozzy with a nice recovery.Sundra seems to have found a
620,00:44:48.17,00:44:48.17,"really good spot.Ozzy, how are your toes doing?"
621,00:44:52.12,00:44:52.12,>> Toes are okay.The sweat's the biggest factor
622,00:44:54.92,00:44:54.92,for me.It's making my nether regions
623,00:44:58.12,00:44:58.12,itchy.Sorry to get gross.
624,00:45:02.67,00:45:02.67,>> PROBST: Sundra loses herbalance.
625,00:45:05.75,00:45:05.75,">> I didn't mean to mess you up,Sundra."
626,00:45:08.21,00:45:08.21,">> PROBST: Sundra, how are yourfeet?"
627,00:45:10.58,00:45:10.58,">> They're okay.>> PROBST: Yul, where are you"
628,00:45:13.04,00:45:13.04,feeling it?>> My toes and my ankles.
629,00:45:26.08,00:45:26.08,">> PROBST: Yul tries to step up,loses his balance."
630,00:45:30.25,00:45:30.25,Yul is the second person out ofthis challenge.
631,00:45:35.04,00:45:35.04,Last person left standingguarantees themselves a spot in
632,00:45:40.00,00:45:40.00,that final three with a shot ata million dollars.
633,00:46:07.79,00:46:07.79,You guys have been up there nowa total now of two hours.
634,00:46:11.08,00:46:11.08,>> Good lord.>> PROBST: One hour since you
635,00:46:12.79,00:46:12.79,went to the final piece of theperch.
636,00:46:20.04,00:46:20.04,Sundra has a momentary bit ofimbalance.
637,00:46:23.96,00:46:23.96,Catches herself.Been up there now for two and a
638,00:47:06.25,00:47:06.25,half hours.>> Damn.
639,00:47:20.50,00:47:20.50,>> PROBST: Sundra losing herbalance.
640,00:47:23.12,00:47:23.12,Sundra is in the water.Ozzy wins the final immunity.
641,00:47:31.75,00:47:31.75,">> Oh, my god!>> That was a great job."
642,00:47:35.08,00:47:35.08,"That was amazing.>> PROBST: Once again, you have"
643,00:47:37.92,00:47:37.92,immunity.This time it guarantees you a
644,00:47:40.42,00:47:40.42,spot at the final tribalcouncil.
645,00:47:42.67,00:47:42.67,"Becky, Yul, Sundra, two of youwill join Ozzy at the final"
646,00:47:45.83,00:47:45.83,tribal.One of you will become our ninth
647,00:47:52.21,00:47:52.21,and final member of the jury.See you there.
648,00:47:54.62,00:47:54.62,"Swim on in.>> Ozzy, give a girl a chance to"
649,00:48:21.00,00:48:21.00,"wear the necklace.>> Oh, man, I'm so pumped about"
650,00:48:25.25,00:48:25.25,winning the challenge today.It was down to the wire.
651,00:48:29.12,00:48:29.12,Sundra completely stunned me.I thought she would have been
652,00:48:32.92,00:48:32.92,off a lot faster than she was.There was few times I almost
653,00:48:35.79,00:48:35.79,"fell off, but I stayed up.And it's crazy to think that I'm"
654,00:48:39.25,00:48:39.25,"finally here, that this is it.You did an amazing job."
655,00:48:43.21,00:48:43.21,You should be proud.>> I'm just picturing myself
656,00:48:46.92,00:48:46.92,"with the immunity necklacewalking in and jury going,"
657,00:48:50.38,00:48:50.38,"""Whoa, Sundra got it,"" you know?So I'm disappointed."
658,00:48:54.12,00:48:54.12,I really thought I had it.I really did.
659,00:48:57.04,00:48:57.04,It all comes to a head in coupleof hours.
660,00:49:01.17,00:49:01.17,>> We're going to tribal counciltonight.
661,00:49:05.21,00:49:05.21,Ozzy has immunity.I have the hidden immunity idol.
662,00:49:07.54,00:49:07.54,So either Sundra or Becky willgo home tonight.
663,00:49:10.38,00:49:10.38,"The question is who to vote off.>> I mean, what do you think?"
664,00:49:13.04,00:49:13.04,>> I don't know.>> Of course.
665,00:49:18.92,00:49:18.92,"It's definitely different foryou than it is for me, because I"
666,00:49:22.54,00:49:22.54,don't have that tie.I don't have anything against
667,00:49:27.62,00:49:27.62,Becky.I don't want to vote her out.
668,00:49:30.08,00:49:30.08,But I couldn't say that there isany huge difference between them
669,00:49:34.29,00:49:34.29,in who is more deserving or not.Unless something gets figured
670,00:49:38.08,00:49:38.08,"out, I think it's going to comedown to a tiebreaker."
671,00:49:41.17,00:49:41.17,"The Aitu four, from the momentof the mutiny we've tried to be"
672,00:49:45.17,00:49:45.17,as fair and equal as possibleand do things the right way.
673,00:49:49.42,00:49:49.42,So I think the fairest thingthat we can come up with is a
674,00:49:53.29,00:49:53.29,"tiebreaker.You know, two of us vote for"
675,00:49:55.83,00:49:55.83,"Becky, two of us vote forSundra, and we let them decide,"
676,00:49:58.71,00:49:58.71,"however that is.I mean, who knows what it's"
677,00:50:01.75,00:50:01.75,going to be?But I don't feel like I should
678,00:50:04.25,00:50:04.25,be in the position to make thatdecision.
679,00:50:06.25,00:50:06.25,"I mean, the way that we've doneit the whole time is trying to"
680,00:50:08.83,00:50:08.83,be as fair as possible.So not to do that now I think
681,00:50:12.33,00:50:12.33,would be a mistake.>> But just because of today...
682,00:50:33.79,00:50:33.79,">> I was trying to convince him,you know, but..."
683,00:50:52.92,00:50:52.92,>> Yul has offered me theimmunity idol.
684,00:50:55.92,00:50:55.92,And the idol guarantees my spotin the final three.
685,00:51:00.25,00:51:00.25,To the jury it would probablylook really bad with the sneak
686,00:51:03.17,00:51:03.17,"attack coming in and, you know,presenting me with the idol."
687,00:51:05.88,00:51:05.88,But it's me or her going hometonight.
688,00:51:08.12,00:51:08.12,"So it's a really hard choice.Oh, yeah."
689,00:51:13.21,00:51:13.21,Let's do this.>> I'm not deciding between the
690,00:51:20.79,00:51:20.79,two of you.Fairest thing to do would be a
691,00:51:22.92,00:51:22.92,tiebreaker.>> I could save Becky
692,00:51:32.08,00:51:32.08,tonight by giving her the idol.The downside to that for me is
693,00:51:36.08,00:51:36.08,I'd be at risk.There's no guarantee that I
694,00:51:38.12,00:51:38.12,won't get voted out tonight.So I'm personally facing a major
695,00:51:40.21,00:51:40.21,dilemma.>> Did she ask you?
696,00:51:47.21,00:51:47.21,Did she ask you to give her theidol?
697,00:51:49.25,00:51:49.25,No?No.
698,00:51:52.96,00:51:52.96,">> I've had to make so manycompromises, and broken so many"
699,00:51:56.33,00:51:56.33,"promises, but the one thing I'vealways kind of stayed true to is"
700,00:51:59.21,00:51:59.21,my friendship with Becky.So to continue honoring that I
701,00:52:02.38,00:52:02.38,feel like I might have to giveher the idol.
702,00:52:06.17,00:52:06.17,">> One, two, three.It's a tough, tough decision."
703,00:52:10.71,00:52:10.71,And I hope to God just thingswork out.
704,00:52:40.88,00:52:40.88,>> PROBST: We'll now bring themembers of our jury.
705,00:52:44.38,00:52:44.38,"Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,Candice, Jonathan, Parvati, and"
706,00:52:53.25,00:52:53.25,"Adam, voted out at the lasttribal council."
707,00:53:05.17,00:53:05.17,"So here's the situation.After tonight's vote, three of"
708,00:53:09.00,00:53:09.00,you will move on to the finaltribal council and have a shot
709,00:53:13.12,00:53:13.12,at the million dollars.The person voted out will become
710,00:53:16.12,00:53:16.12,the ninth and final member ofour jury.
711,00:53:19.12,00:53:19.12,So let's review where we are.Yul and Ozzy appear to be safe.
712,00:53:24.00,00:53:24.00,Yul because as far as I knowstill has the hidden immunity
713,00:53:26.12,00:53:26.12,idol.Ozzy is wearing immunity.
714,00:53:29.00,00:53:29.00,That leaves us with Becky andSundra.
715,00:53:32.04,00:53:32.04,Last tribal council you had aplan.
716,00:53:34.75,00:53:34.75,"You weren't worried.So Sundra, do you feel"
717,00:53:37.25,00:53:37.25,differently tonight than you didlast tribal council?
718,00:53:40.25,00:53:40.25,">> My decision to not activelygo to out the idol was a risk,"
719,00:53:43.71,00:53:43.71,and you have to be ready for thegood and the bad.
720,00:53:46.83,00:53:46.83,I was never worry free.I knew that there was a risk I'd
721,00:53:49.04,00:53:49.04,have to take.And I'm willing to live with how
722,00:53:51.67,00:53:51.67,"things are.>> PROBST: So, with Becky and"
723,00:53:54.46,00:53:54.46,"Sundra sitting on the hot seat,Ozzy, you go back to camp."
724,00:53:57.88,00:53:57.88,Was there any discussion aboutwho deserves it?
725,00:54:01.79,00:54:01.79,">> We got back and right away Isaid, ""You know, I think that it"
726,00:54:04.67,00:54:04.67,"should be a tie.""And the girls agree that that"
727,00:54:07.58,00:54:07.58,was probably the best thing todo.
728,00:54:09.71,00:54:09.71,"So instead of going behind eachothers' back, none of that"
729,00:54:11.92,00:54:11.92,happened at all.So I'm voting for Becky out.
730,00:54:15.04,00:54:15.04,Yul is voting for Sundra out.They're obviously voting for
731,00:54:17.96,00:54:17.96,each other.And we're going to let the cards
732,00:54:19.96,00:54:19.96,"fall where they may.>> PROBST: Yul, you're in an"
733,00:54:23.71,00:54:23.71,interesting position.Because if you still have the
734,00:54:26.04,00:54:26.04,"hidden immunity idol you couldgive it to somebody, and nobody"
735,00:54:29.04,00:54:29.04,"would necessarily know, whichgives you power."
736,00:54:32.08,00:54:32.08,>> I knew that the idol couldpotentially be played tonight.
737,00:54:36.08,00:54:36.08,But I came up with a solutionthat everyone seemed happy with.
738,00:54:38.25,00:54:38.25,"So...>> PROBST: Sundra, if Yul wanted"
739,00:54:41.42,00:54:41.42,"to play the idol he certainlywouldn't say he was going to,"
740,00:54:44.50,00:54:44.50,"and he would say exactly what hejust did, which is, ""Never"
741,00:54:47.67,00:54:47.67,"really came up."">> Of course."
742,00:54:49.33,00:54:49.33,That thought came into my headseveral times.
743,00:54:51.21,00:54:51.21,"And if I get played then I'm thebig sucker, you know?"
744,00:54:53.92,00:54:53.92,"And if he does that, that's onhim."

843,01:04:37.96,01:04:37.96,some kind of incredibly luciddream.

848,01:04:56.00,01:04:56.00,challenge last night.And also I am very proud of
849,01:04:59.88,01:04:59.88,myself for not giving in totemptation of taking the easy
850,01:05:02.92,01:05:02.92,route and just accepting theoffer from Yul to take the idol.
851,01:05:06.12,01:05:06.12,Because tonight for sure I thinkthat the jury members will be
852,01:05:10.79,01:05:10.79,coming at me with questionsabout riding the backs of Ozzy
853,01:05:14.04,01:05:14.04,and Yul.But I think that I have played a
854,01:05:18.21,01:05:18.21,very social game.I'm proud of it.
855,01:05:32.21,01:05:32.21,">> What the hell?Yul, get out here!"
856,01:05:37.08,01:05:37.08,"Oh, my god.Whoa!"

864,01:06:18.25,01:06:18.25,Yul and I that happened to bethere when the feast arrived.
865,01:06:21.25,01:06:21.25,I think that that was symbolicof how the jury vote will play
866,01:06:26.50,01:06:26.50,out.I think Yul and I will get the
867,01:06:28.92,01:06:28.92,"majority of the votes, andreally doubting that Becky's"
868,01:06:31.92,01:06:31.92,"going to get any votes,especially because last night"
869,01:06:34.25,01:06:34.25,was such an incrediblyembarrassing display of
870,01:06:37.12,01:06:37.12,fire-making skills.>> Becky!
871,01:06:41.12,01:06:41.12,Come on!>> Come on!
872,01:06:43.33,01:06:43.33,Where have you been?>> You missed it.
873,01:06:45.08,01:06:45.08,It's like a Cook feast!The fact that I was able to
874,01:06:51.50,01:06:51.50,"start this whole adventure withBecky on day one, the fact that"
875,01:06:54.21,01:06:54.21,"I'm able to finish with it her,you know, has got to be a dream,"
876,01:06:56.92,01:06:56.92,"right?>> Congratulations, guys."
877,01:06:59.25,01:06:59.25,>> Woo-hoo!>> Finding a really good friend
878,01:07:02.92,01:07:02.92,is worth more than a milliondollars.
879,01:07:05.21,01:07:05.21,"I mean, friendships like the oneI have with Becky I think are"
880,01:07:07.21,01:07:07.21,that rare.I tried to play the game with as
881,01:07:12.75,01:07:12.75,much integrity as I could.I know that I failed in a lot of
882,01:07:14.75,01:07:14.75,"respects.But, you know, hopefully people"
883,01:07:16.79,01:07:16.79,won't hold it against me that Ibeat them.
884,01:07:23.50,01:07:23.50,>> I'm just hoping final tribalgoes really well.

887,01:07:30.08,01:07:30.08,"Mexico, and I have broken a lotof stereotypes."
888,01:07:33.88,01:07:33.88,I'm a surfer up against twolawyers.
889,01:07:36.71,01:07:36.71,"Hopefully my actions, myintentions, and everything that"
890,01:07:40.88,01:07:40.88,I've done in this game speak forthemselves.
891,01:07:43.29,01:07:43.29,"All I've got to do is hold ittogether one more night,"
892,01:07:46.62,01:07:46.62,and finally this dream may takea step into reality.

916,01:09:41.62,01:09:41.62,statement.>> When I came here I wanted to
917,01:09:44.92,01:09:44.92,play a certain way.I didn't want to just play an
918,01:09:47.25,01:09:47.25,individual game where I just gotmyself to the final.
919,01:09:50.08,01:09:50.08,I honestly feel that I'veprobably done more than anyone
920,01:09:53.25,01:09:53.25,else to really affect andinfluence the overall course of
921,01:09:56.25,01:09:56.25,this game.I was able to bring everyone in
922,01:09:59.58,01:09:59.58,"my tribe and everyone in myalliance to the final four, and"
923,01:10:02.25,01:10:02.25,ultimately to the final three.I don't think it's just
924,01:10:05.79,01:10:05.79,coincidence that I've been onthe teams and alliances that
925,01:10:08.25,01:10:08.25,ultimately became dominant.I think I played a pretty key
926,01:10:10.83,01:10:10.83,role in leading these teams.I won't lie about the fact that
927,01:10:13.12,01:10:13.12,I have had to manipulate anddeceive people.
928,01:10:15.25,01:10:15.25,But I stayed loyal to people whoare loyal to me.
929,01:10:18.04,01:10:18.04,So I would love to get your votetonight.

936,01:10:39.25,01:10:39.25,"have to, you know, basicallyrely on my social game and the"
937,01:10:44.17,01:10:44.17,way I can connect with people.And I wanted to form an alliance
938,01:10:47.04,01:10:47.04,"with people that I trusted, thatI knew that, you know, if I gave"
939,01:10:49.25,01:10:49.25,my word and they gave their wordI could count on that.
940,01:10:52.04,01:10:52.04,"I've really tried to play thesocial game-- being fair, being"
941,01:10:55.58,01:10:55.58,"honest to the best of myabilities, and I'm true to my"
942,01:10:58.33,01:10:58.33,character.So that's why I'm asking for
943,01:11:03.08,01:11:03.08,your vote tonight.>> PROBST: Ozzy.
944,01:11:06.54,01:11:06.54,">> From the beginning of thisgame I was the underdog, you"
945,01:11:09.75,01:11:09.75,know?My people were voted out the
946,01:11:12.33,01:11:12.33,first tribe.And I found myself in a position
947,01:11:15.08,01:11:15.08,that was really scary.But I never let that stop me.
948,01:11:18.17,01:11:18.17,"And I said, you know, ""Hey, I'mhere to play a game and just try"
949,01:11:22.54,01:11:22.54,"as hard as I can and do whateverI can."""
950,01:11:25.00,01:11:25.00,"And that came down to providing,you know?"
951,01:11:27.50,01:11:27.50,"I knew that if I didn't fish, ifI didn't go out and provide for"
952,01:11:30.33,01:11:30.33,"people, that my ass was gone.That was the bottom line."
953,01:11:34.42,01:11:34.42,"You know, I never tried to hidewho I was or what I was or how"
954,01:11:37.17,01:11:37.17,"strong I was.You know, I came out here and I"
955,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,embraced every aspect of thisgame wholeheartedly with my soul
956,01:11:44.54,01:11:44.54,in every single moment that Ipossibly could.
957,01:11:48.21,01:11:48.21,I think that my actions and myreputation in this game speaks
958,01:11:51.71,01:11:51.71,louder than any words I'm goingto be able to.
959,01:11:56.50,01:11:56.50,">> PROBST: All right, jury, in amoment you're going to get your"
960,01:11:59.04,01:11:59.04,first chance to address them.I'll give you a minute to think
961,01:12:01.38,01:12:01.38,"about what you want to say.>> PROBST: All right, jury, it's"
962,01:12:25.83,01:12:25.83,"now your turn to address Yul,Becky, and Ozzy, gather"
963,01:12:29.67,01:12:29.67,information to help you make amillion dollar decision.
964,01:12:32.79,01:12:32.79,"Nate, get us started.>> Snap."
965,01:12:37.96,01:12:37.96,"Well, first of all, I got togive you guys some props,"
966,01:12:40.25,01:12:40.25,really.Congratulate yourself on how you
967,01:12:42.38,01:12:42.38,"did the game.Yul, I'm going to kind of put"
968,01:12:45.67,01:12:45.67,you in my light of godfather.You played it like the big
969,01:12:48.71,01:12:48.71,"gangster boss.I don't know, brother, but"
970,01:12:50.92,01:12:50.92,"you're very intelligent.You kind of sat back, and you"
971,01:12:53.08,01:12:53.08,played the game completelysmart.
972,01:12:55.29,01:12:55.29,"Ozzy, you are the other side ofthe coin, my brother."
973,01:12:58.21,01:12:58.21,"You I see as, like, the warriorkind of style, you know?"
974,01:13:02.75,01:13:02.75,And that was apparent inchallenges.
975,01:13:05.08,01:13:05.08,But I want to see how you from astrategy point played the game
976,01:13:07.88,01:13:07.88,better than Yul.>> I believe the very first
977,01:13:11.54,01:13:11.54,third of this game I played anincredibly pivotal role in
978,01:13:14.67,01:13:14.67,deciding the ultimate fate ofthe game.
979,01:13:18.46,01:13:18.46,I found myself in the positionearly on of being the Yul of my
980,01:13:23.42,01:13:23.42,tribe.I was the one who convinced my
981,01:13:26.88,01:13:26.88,tribe to throw the challenge toget Billy voted off.
982,01:13:29.71,01:13:29.71,"I said, ""You know, guys, Billy'staking us all down."""
983,01:13:32.83,01:13:32.83,And I was of the one who wascontrolling things.
984,01:13:35.29,01:13:35.29,"And then once we merged, Irelied on myself over anybody"
985,01:13:38.62,01:13:38.62,"else.And, you know, maybe I did play"
986,01:13:41.25,01:13:41.25,"up the fact that, ""Yeah, bro,I'm a surfer dude."
987,01:13:44.25,01:13:44.25,"Don't worry about me.I'll provide the fish, and I'll"
988,01:13:47.08,01:13:47.08,"be chill, man.""You know, so I played that."
989,01:13:50.04,01:13:50.04,I played that as much aspossible.
990,01:13:52.17,01:13:52.17,"So the strategy point for me, itworked because I just relied on"
991,01:13:55.04,01:13:55.04,"myself, and it got me as far ashere."
992,01:13:58.29,01:13:58.29,">> Respect.All right, Becky, you've got the"
993,01:14:02.21,01:14:02.21,mob boss and the warrior.Why do you deserve a million
994,01:14:09.46,01:14:09.46,dollars over these two?>> I know that I was lucky to be
995,01:14:15.17,01:14:15.17,with the people that I wasaligned with.
996,01:14:17.50,01:14:17.50,"But whenever you say that Yulwas the puppet master, you don't"
997,01:14:20.38,01:14:20.38,know all the conversations thatwe had on every decision that we
998,01:14:23.96,01:14:23.96,were going to make.We decided together.
999,01:14:26.50,01:14:26.50,"Like, it wasn't making Yulmaking decisions by himself when"
1000,01:14:28.62,01:14:28.62,you say that he was thegodfather.
1001,01:14:30.04,01:14:30.04,>> PROBST: Satisfied?>> No.
1002,01:14:33.75,01:14:33.75,I'm being real.I'm not satisfied.
1003,01:14:35.75,01:14:35.75,"It's a million dollars rightnow, you know?"
1004,01:14:37.62,01:14:37.62,"Becky, are you saying that youran it?"
1005,01:14:39.33,01:14:39.33,Were you the boss?>> No.
1006,01:14:41.38,01:14:41.38,That's my point.I don't think there was a boss.
1007,01:14:43.92,01:14:43.92,We seriously were able to go tothe final four because we relied
1008,01:14:46.50,01:14:46.50,"on each other, and we workedtogether and made decisions"
1009,01:14:49.29,01:14:49.29,"together.And, like, I know that from the"
1010,01:14:52.04,01:14:52.04,"jury's point of view, seeing howI played, I played"
1011,01:14:54.21,01:14:54.21,conservatively.I didn't take risks.
1012,01:14:56.33,01:14:56.33,But the biggest risk I thinkthat I personally took was when
1013,01:14:59.12,01:14:59.12,I rejected the idol the nightbefore tribal council.
1014,01:15:02.04,01:15:02.04,Yul offered me the idol to savemy butt.
1015,01:15:05.21,01:15:05.21,"And I said no, because I didn'twant to slide into the top"
1016,01:15:08.42,01:15:08.42,three.I wanted to earn it.
1017,01:15:10.96,01:15:10.96,">> Cool.>> PROBST: Thanks, Nate."
1018,01:15:13.79,01:15:13.79,Jenny.>> My question is directed to
1019,01:15:21.42,01:15:21.42,Yul.What do you think is more
1020,01:15:24.21,01:15:24.21,"important in winning this game,the physical element or the"
1021,01:15:28.75,01:15:28.75,strategical element?>> Clearly in my case I think is
1022,01:15:32.92,01:15:32.92,"a game about social strategy.I mean, again, if it was all"
1023,01:15:35.62,01:15:35.62,"about physical survival skillsor physical challenges, it would"
1024,01:15:38.96,01:15:38.96,be a very different game.And I was happy to let Ozzy set
1025,01:15:42.12,01:15:42.12,"himself up as a huge target,which he did."
1026,01:15:44.67,01:15:44.67,And that deflected a lot ofattention away from me.
1027,01:15:47.12,01:15:47.12,So it was all part of strategy.And the ultimate outcome here is
1028,01:15:49.33,01:15:49.33,everyone in my tribe made thefinal four.
1029,01:15:52.12,01:15:52.12,>> I respect that.Good luck to all three of you.
1030,01:15:55.21,01:15:55.21,Thank you.>> PROBST: Parvati.
1031,01:16:02.92,01:16:02.92,>> Congrats.You earned your spots up there
1032,01:16:05.08,01:16:05.08,"tonight.Beckers, I was floored last"
1033,01:16:08.17,01:16:08.17,night that you would putyourself in a position of going
1034,01:16:11.12,01:16:11.12,up against Sundra in a fire-making challenge.
1035,01:16:15.08,01:16:15.08,And now I just find out that youdeclined the idol from Yul.
1036,01:16:19.50,01:16:19.50,But you're sitting betweengiants right now.
1037,01:16:23.21,01:16:23.21,And I want to you convince methat you want to win this game.
1038,01:16:26.79,01:16:26.79,>> I wouldn't have been able toaccept that idol and sit here
1039,01:16:29.25,01:16:29.25,proud.I think I would have cheated my
1040,01:16:31.25,01:16:31.25,"way.You know, that's not who I am."
1041,01:16:33.33,01:16:33.33,I'm not a sneaky person.For me I never wanted to regret
1042,01:16:35.88,01:16:35.88,making the decisions that Imade.
1043,01:16:38.17,01:16:38.17,"And I wanted to win it the waythat... you know, that I am"
1044,01:16:41.12,01:16:41.12,proud.>> Okay.
1045,01:16:44.21,01:16:44.21,">> PROBST: Thanks, Pavarti.Rebecca, you're up."
1046,01:16:50.71,01:16:50.71,Hi.Congratulations to all three of
1047,01:16:53.04,01:16:53.04,you.My question is to Yul and Ozzy.
1048,01:16:55.54,01:16:55.54,Right now I'm pretty much tornbetween the two of you.
1049,01:16:59.75,01:16:59.75,"Yul, I thought the strategicallyyou were flawless in playing"
1050,01:17:02.17,01:17:02.17,"this game.Ozzy, you were flawless in every"
1051,01:17:05.25,01:17:05.25,challenge.I need both of you to kind of
1052,01:17:08.04,01:17:08.04,tell me something that I don'tknow that will help me decide
1053,01:17:11.54,01:17:11.54,"why you deserve the money, Yul.>> One of the main reasons I"
1054,01:17:16.67,01:17:16.67,wanted to even be on Survivorwas the fact that minorities
1055,01:17:19.08,01:17:19.08,were underrepresented in themedia.
1056,01:17:21.88,01:17:21.88,"Like, when I grew up I didn'tsee any people that looked like"
1057,01:17:23.58,01:17:23.58,me on TV.And whenever you see a lot of
1058,01:17:25.29,01:17:25.29,minorities on TV they're justkind of caricatures.
1059,01:17:27.12,01:17:27.12,I wanted America to see AsianAmerican men as they truly are.
1060,01:17:30.42,01:17:30.42,"And if I do win this game, youknow, I'd want to be very"
1061,01:17:34.21,01:17:34.21,visible spokesperson for talkingabout how we can move forward
1062,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,and try to get more minoritiesrepresented on TV.
1063,01:17:39.83,01:17:39.83,>> Okay.Thank you.
1064,01:17:42.08,01:17:42.08,"Ozzy?>> In line with Yul, you know, I"
1065,01:17:45.08,01:17:45.08,have very similar interests andgoals.
1066,01:17:47.12,01:17:47.12,And that is changing thestereotypes and classic image
1067,01:17:51.25,01:17:51.25,"of, ""Hey, what's a Mexican?""The opportunity to be able to"
1068,01:17:54.62,01:17:54.62,come out here and to dominate ina lot of different aspects I
1069,01:17:58.21,01:17:58.21,think is really going to changethe perception of what is a
1070,01:18:01.33,01:18:01.33,Mexican.And this is a Mexican right
1071,01:18:04.21,01:18:04.21,"here.So using my position, I think"
1072,01:18:06.88,01:18:06.88,that I can become a positiverole model for any kind of kid
1073,01:18:11.04,01:18:11.04,"out there, you know?And I think that we have the"
1074,01:18:13.58,01:18:13.58,opportunity right now to changethe world a little bit.
1075,01:18:16.08,01:18:16.08,So...>> Thank you from the two of
1076,01:18:19.25,01:18:19.25,you.That helped me a lot.
1077,01:18:21.29,01:18:21.29,">> PROBST: Thanks, Rebecca.Adam?"
1078,01:18:27.17,01:18:27.17,">> I think you four, the threeof you and Sundra, have been"
1079,01:18:33.21,01:18:33.21,painfully boring through tribalcouncils.
1080,01:18:35.25,01:18:35.25,And I want you to get to thepoint.
1081,01:18:37.12,01:18:37.12,Just want to start off by sayingthat.
1082,01:18:39.83,01:18:39.83,"For Ozzy, I want to you talktrash about these two."
1083,01:18:42.67,01:18:42.67,I really do.I don't want you talk anything
1084,01:18:45.33,01:18:45.33,about you.I want to you talk some trash
1085,01:18:48.21,01:18:48.21,about these two.Why they shouldn't win it.
1086,01:18:50.12,01:18:50.12,Not about you.>> All right.
1087,01:18:52.75,01:18:52.75,"Well, I'll start with Yul.I know that Yul didn't work as"
1088,01:18:56.67,01:18:56.67,hard as he could.I just think that one of the
1089,01:18:59.17,01:18:59.17,worst things you can do is nottry as hard as possible.
1090,01:19:03.08,01:19:03.08,And that's something that Ithink that Yul might have done.
1091,01:19:05.54,01:19:05.54,"For Becky, I think that a lot ofit was Becky riding on"
1092,01:19:09.08,01:19:09.08,coattails.And the fire making?
1093,01:19:12.62,01:19:12.62,The fire making is thatsomething that after 39 days
1094,01:19:15.83,01:19:15.83,you've got to be able to do.>> Okay.
1095,01:19:18.54,01:19:18.54,"That's fine.>> PROBST: Thanks, Adam."
1096,01:19:23.25,01:19:23.25,"Candice.>> First of all, I think the"
1097,01:19:30.58,01:19:30.58,"fact that you guys made it afterthe infamous mutiny, I think"
1098,01:19:34.46,01:19:34.46,"it's cool, even though I'm notsitting over there."
1099,01:19:38.25,01:19:38.25,My question goes to Yul.Whenever you're asked a question
1100,01:19:42.17,01:19:42.17,you kind of beat around the bushif you don't want to answer it.
1101,01:19:45.62,01:19:45.62,"You know, you'll say what peoplewant to hear."
1102,01:19:49.12,01:19:49.12,I don't want to give you theopportunity to do that again
1103,01:19:51.62,01:19:51.62,tonight.So I'm going to ask you a yes or
1104,01:19:54.04,01:19:54.04,no question.I want to be very clear if you
1105,01:19:56.21,01:19:56.21,say anything other than yes orno...
1106,01:19:59.12,01:19:59.12,>> Got it.>> ...I will not vote for you.
1107,01:20:01.92,01:20:01.92,>> Got it.>> That's all I want to hear.
1108,01:20:04.00,01:20:04.00,">> All right, all right.>> My impression is that you"
1109,01:20:06.21,01:20:06.21,have been shamelessly workingthis jury.
1110,01:20:12.29,01:20:12.29,Is that true?( laughter )
1111,01:20:19.79,01:20:19.79,>> Yes.>> Thank you.
1112,01:20:23.17,01:20:23.17,"That was tough for you, I know.>> Well, shamelessly is..."
1113,01:20:26.17,01:20:26.17,">> No, no.I answered yes or no."
1114,01:20:29.08,01:20:29.08,I answered yes or no.I answered yes or no.
1115,01:20:33.46,01:20:33.46,>> I'm going to have to thinkabout that one.
1116,01:20:35.96,01:20:35.96,"You broke the rules.>> PROBST: Thanks, Candice."
1117,01:20:39.00,01:20:39.00,Brad.>> Kudos to all three of you.
1118,01:20:43.50,01:20:43.50,"Seriously, congratulations.Ozzy, I've pretty much had,"
1119,01:20:47.04,01:20:47.04,"like, 15-second conversationwith you in my entire life."
1120,01:20:51.17,01:20:51.17,I want to know what has been themost challenging experience in
1121,01:20:54.21,01:20:54.21,"your life, and how did youovercome that?"
1122,01:20:58.17,01:20:58.17,>> The most challengingexperience in my life would
1123,01:21:03.38,01:21:03.38,probably be the relationshipthat I have with my father.
1124,01:21:06.42,01:21:06.42,"For whatever reason, the manjust can't be around, and"
1125,01:21:09.83,01:21:09.83,doesn't want to takeresponsibility.
1126,01:21:12.29,01:21:12.29,So I'm the one who's had toalways had to make the effort to
1127,01:21:15.00,01:21:15.00,try to get to know him and totry and know my family in
1128,01:21:17.71,01:21:17.71,Mexico.I love my family more than
1129,01:21:19.83,01:21:19.83,anything.But my father just has never
1130,01:21:22.08,01:21:22.08,"been there for me.And to not have that as a kid,"
1131,01:21:25.50,01:21:25.50,it's just a different thing toknow that the person that
1132,01:21:29.00,01:21:29.00,"created you doesn't want youaround, or whatever."
1133,01:21:45.42,01:21:45.42,"Anyway, it's the hardestexperience."
1134,01:21:48.67,01:21:48.67,">> Wow, thank you for that.Thank you for sharing that."
1135,01:21:52.17,01:21:52.17,"Thanks, guys.>> PROBST: Thanks, Brad."
1136,01:21:55.79,01:21:55.79,Sundra.>> My people.
1137,01:22:01.67,01:22:01.67,The thing that I wanted to askyou guys is what is one thing
1138,01:22:06.17,01:22:06.17,"that you have either discoveredabout yourself, discovered about"
1139,01:22:10.08,01:22:10.08,"life in general, from being inthis game all the way up to day"
1140,01:22:14.92,01:22:14.92,freakin' 39.I'll start with Ozzy.
1141,01:22:18.00,01:22:18.00,>> Pure love.There's absolutely nothing here
1142,01:22:21.38,01:22:21.38,"except for your mind, your soul,your body, what you can do with"
1143,01:22:25.79,01:22:25.79,mother nature.And just learning to love
1144,01:22:29.62,01:22:29.62,unconditionally.And I don't want to sound like a
1145,01:22:32.25,01:22:32.25,hippie-dippy patchouli-stinkin'hippie.
1146,01:22:35.04,01:22:35.04,It's really just about lovingand cherishing every single
1147,01:22:37.25,01:22:37.25,moment.>> Becky.
1148,01:22:40.29,01:22:40.29,">> I mean, when I first got hereI kept asking, ""What time is it?"
1149,01:22:43.08,01:22:43.08,"What time do you think it is?""And they'd be like, ""Dude, why"
1150,01:22:45.71,01:22:45.71,"do you care?""I've always been a person who"
1151,01:22:48.12,01:22:48.12,has everything set by the timeand by the minute.
1152,01:22:50.50,01:22:50.50,And everything is alwaysscheduled.
1153,01:22:52.92,01:22:52.92,"And just letting everything go,it was very scary to me, because"
1154,01:22:55.29,01:22:55.29,those are things that I felt hadalways defined me.
1155,01:22:59.75,01:22:59.75,I definitely have learned how totake a moment for myself.
1156,01:23:02.29,01:23:02.29,Being here in this moment I'vefinally been able to appreciate
1157,01:23:04.71,01:23:04.71,that.>> Yul.
1158,01:23:08.67,01:23:08.67,>> I think the one thing I'vereally realized is just kind of
1159,01:23:11.21,01:23:11.21,a newfound kind of selfconfidence in myself.
1160,01:23:14.38,01:23:14.38,"You know, I came here with a lotof fears, a lot of self doubt, a"
1161,01:23:17.17,01:23:17.17,lot of anxieties.And just to know that I could
1162,01:23:19.62,01:23:19.62,"make it through all the way, Ireally feel that I now believe"
1163,01:23:23.17,01:23:23.17,in myself that I can do what Ireally feel passionate about.
1164,01:23:26.38,01:23:26.38,">> Well, I want to say it was apleasure, because I think you"
1165,01:23:28.83,01:23:28.83,"guys are intelligent andbeautiful people, and I love you"
1166,01:23:31.08,01:23:31.08,"guys, truly.And good luck."
1167,01:23:35.33,01:23:35.33,">> PROBST: Jonathan.>> Guys, congratulations."
1168,01:23:44.29,01:23:44.29,"It's been my pleasure to playthe game, and honestly, I'm"
1169,01:23:47.25,01:23:47.25,"thrilled for the three of you,you played hard, you played"
1170,01:23:50.04,01:23:50.04,"well, you played me-- okay,shame on me."
1171,01:23:53.04,01:23:53.04,"Yul, brilliant man, very politeperson."
1172,01:23:58.33,01:23:58.33,And polite is sort of the otherhalf of the word of politic.
1173,01:24:01.88,01:24:01.88,Certainly you are a civic-mindedperson.
1174,01:24:05.04,01:24:05.04,You could conceive even ofrunning for office.
1175,01:24:07.04,01:24:07.04,"So, Yul, your futureconstituents have watched the"
1176,01:24:09.29,01:24:09.29,"season, because they're thinkingof voting for you."
1177,01:24:12.21,01:24:12.21,"Explain to people who would votefor you how telling half truths,"
1178,01:24:16.92,01:24:16.92,"which were also half lies, keepsin line with your integrity,"
1179,01:24:21.08,01:24:21.08,"good intentions, and yourability to serve them in the"
1180,01:24:24.00,01:24:24.00,future.>> I think what you said is
1181,01:24:26.58,01:24:26.58,absolutely true.I have done a lot of deceiving
1182,01:24:28.96,01:24:28.96,"in this game, a lot ofmanipulation."
1183,01:24:30.96,01:24:30.96,"But Survivor is a game,obviously."
1184,01:24:32.96,01:24:32.96,Everyone here came in the gameknowing what the game was about.
1185,01:24:35.25,01:24:35.25,"If I was outside this game, Iwould never do this to"
1186,01:24:37.67,01:24:37.67,unsuspecting people.Look-- I have the ability and I
1187,01:24:41.38,01:24:41.38,have the technique to manipulatepeople.
1188,01:24:44.21,01:24:44.21,"But if you look at the overallgame, you know, I've stayed true"
1189,01:24:46.83,01:24:46.83,to the original people that Imade alliances with.
1190,01:24:50.62,01:24:50.62,"Anyway, I hope that answers yourquestion."
1191,01:24:53.08,01:24:53.08,">> It did, very well.Thank you."
1192,01:24:55.21,01:24:55.21,"Ozzy, you are obviouslyextraordinarily talented, with"
1193,01:25:00.08,01:25:00.08,the enviable ability to win atthese challenges and do almost
1194,01:25:03.62,01:25:03.62,"supernatural things, or at leastsuperhuman things."
1195,01:25:07.54,01:25:07.54,"On occasion I have found youarrogant, I have found you with"
1196,01:25:12.96,01:25:12.96,an attitude of entitlement.You act as if you are a prince
1197,01:25:16.92,01:25:16.92,"to me.No, I mean that honestly."
1198,01:25:20.67,01:25:20.67,I'm a little uncomfortablegiving million dollars to a 25-
1199,01:25:23.46,01:25:23.46,year-old kid that I perceive ashaving some issues of
1200,01:25:27.12,01:25:27.12,"entitlement, okay?What I'd like to hear from you"
1201,01:25:31.25,01:25:31.25,is how is giving you a milliondollars going to make you a
1202,01:25:34.50,01:25:34.50,"better person, your world abetter place, and, in fact, my"
1203,01:25:39.21,01:25:39.21,world a better place.Please.
1204,01:25:41.83,01:25:41.83,">> If I had a million dollars,honestly, Jonathan, I would go"
1205,01:25:44.33,01:25:44.33,back to school.Because going to school has been
1206,01:25:47.04,01:25:47.04,"very hard for me, because I'vehad to pay for it myself."
1207,01:25:49.58,01:25:49.58,So the first thing I would do iscomplete a higher education with
1208,01:25:54.04,01:25:54.04,money that I don't necessarilyhave to worry about owing to
1209,01:25:59.29,01:25:59.29,somebody else.After the schooling I would love
1210,01:26:02.50,01:26:02.50,"to just be able to try andchange the world for the better,"
1211,01:26:05.17,01:26:05.17,"honestly.>> Thank you, guys."
1212,01:26:14.79,01:26:14.79,>> PROBST: All right.We'll give the jury a moment to
1213,01:26:16.71,01:26:16.71,"think about what they've heard,then we will vote."
1214,01:26:34.33,01:26:34.33,>> PROBST: All right.It's time to get to the vote.
1215,01:26:37.50,01:26:37.50,Tonight it's a little different.Tonight you want to see your

1219,01:27:06.17,01:27:06.17,in the game that you played.But Yul outplayed you all.
1220,01:27:53.50,01:27:53.50,>> The ultimate competitor.The fire that you've brought to
1221,01:27:58.17,01:27:58.17,this game completely captivatedme.
1222,01:28:01.33,01:28:01.33,I think that you played yourheart out.
1223,01:28:03.67,01:28:03.67,You totally deserve to win thisgame.
