267,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,original Kota will sticktogether and pick one of the
268,00:16:09.79,00:16:09.79,"three Fang members off.If it's not me, I'll go along"
269,00:16:13.38,00:16:13.38,"with it.If it is me, I'll burn the camp"
270,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,down.>> This is unbelievable.

280,00:16:37.21,00:16:37.21,"So, my strategy right now atKota is to just keep working"
281,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,hard at camp.And I'm hoping that they see
282,00:16:43.75,00:16:43.75,"that as a positive and say,""She's worth keeping."""
283,00:16:57.58,00:16:57.58,">> Comfort time!When I got to Exile, there was"
284,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,a choice between comfort andthe clue.
285,00:17:03.96,00:17:03.96,"And I already have the idol, soI chose comfort."
286,00:17:07.71,00:17:07.71,"Home, sweet home.I walked up to my Sugar shack."
287,00:17:12.17,00:17:12.17,It was like Christmas morning.There was pineapple and oranges
288,00:17:16.71,00:17:16.71,"and apples and coconut.Oh, my God."
289,00:17:23.67,00:17:23.67,This is so good.(laughing)
290,00:17:32.08,00:17:32.08,(sighs)This game is so crazy because
291,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,I don't know what team I'm goingto be on when I get back.
292,00:17:38.88,00:17:38.88,"I'm hoping that I go back toFang, so that I can be with Ace."
293,00:17:43.96,00:17:43.96,"And hopefully they'll vote offKelly, and then I can come take"
294,00:17:47.38,00:17:47.38,her spot.I'm sure they will.
295,00:17:50.08,00:17:50.08,"They're not idiots.>> All right, guys."

301,00:18:15.50,00:18:15.50,for me.I still got four people of my

303,00:18:20.79,00:18:20.79,I don't think I could be in abetter position right now.
304,00:18:22.29,00:18:22.29,">> If we walk around and pullginger, you can cut the root"
305,00:18:24.83,00:18:24.83,and you can put it right intothe rice.
306,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,>> Yeah.>> Same with the watercress.
307,00:18:27.88,00:18:27.88,">> Oh, yeah, and ferns.>> We can't find the ginger."
308,00:18:29.42,00:18:29.42,">> Oh, I can show you it.>> Oh!"
309,00:18:32.21,00:18:32.21,Thank you! Thank you!>> Yeah.
310,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,>> Because you guys didn'treally invite anybody else with
311,00:18:59.88,00:18:59.88,"you guys wherever you went.>> Listening to Kelly talk, she"
312,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,felt like an outcast.She felt like she needed to
313,00:19:08.83,00:19:08.83,"belong somewhere, and maybe shereally does belong with Fang."
314,00:19:14.75,00:19:14.75,>> I was starting to count downthe days and the hours.
315,00:19:18.04,00:19:18.04,">> Not much we can do, but...>> Yeah."
316,00:19:29.75,00:19:29.75,">> I don't know, it's so weird.They are just so fake."
317,00:19:31.62,00:19:31.62,"Like, I'm a salesperson.I know I can analyze people and,"
318,00:19:35.46,00:19:35.46,"like, get along with allpersonalities."
319,00:19:36.96,00:19:36.96,"And even change my personality,and act like something"
320,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,"sometimes.But, to them, it was just like,"
321,00:19:41.54,00:19:41.54,"I would sit there and just,like, listen to them."
322,00:19:44.62,00:19:44.62,I definitely would rather jumpship and go with Fang than I
323,00:19:47.83,00:19:47.83,"would with old Kota.'Cause, you know what?"
324,00:19:49.42,00:19:49.42,They didn't even give me achance.
325,00:19:50.88,00:19:50.88,And I think Crystal and G-Sizzleand Ken have something going on.
326,00:19:55.83,00:19:55.83,"So, I definitely want to be apart of that because they"
327,00:19:57.62,00:19:57.62,overrule all the votes.>> What you see.

336,00:20:31.96,00:20:31.96,side because she did not getalong with Kota.
337,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,"Oh, yeah, she's also hot.There you go."
338,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,">> I know.I'm so happy that I get to,"

354,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17,challenges themselves.I think it will be really hard
355,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,"to put Randy out before Susie,but it's certainly not out of"
356,00:21:45.67,00:21:45.67,the question.Susie is doing a great job
357,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,around camp.And if Randy has a poor
358,00:21:49.88,00:21:49.88,performance on a challenge andhe's not really doing much
359,00:21:51.71,00:21:51.71,"around camp, shoot, I wouldrather keep Susie around."
360,00:21:54.00,00:21:54.00,"The question will really be,""How does Randy perform when it"

461,00:28:55.08,00:28:55.08,so much fun.It was like we were legless

474,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,>> Originally we were thinkingabout voting for Ace or Jacquie
475,00:29:44.00,00:29:44.00,"tonight, but judging by the waythat Kelly performed today,"
476,00:29:47.71,00:29:47.71,Kelly's going home tonight iswhat I'm thinking.
477,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,"Um, I'm going to talk to theothers."
478,00:29:51.96,00:29:51.96,"I'm going to talk to Kenny andCrystal, and I'm sure everybody"
479,00:29:54.62,00:29:54.62,will be fine with voting Kellyout tonight.

483,00:30:12.46,00:30:12.46,"Yeah, I mean, um, but I think,I mean, maybe we should switch"
484,00:30:16.25,00:30:16.25,"it to Kelly, man.She kind of has a bad attitude"
485,00:30:19.33,00:30:19.33,about stuff and she... Jacquiedid at least all right today.
486,00:30:24.54,00:30:24.54,Are you all cool with that?>> I'm good with Kelly.
487,00:30:27.79,00:30:27.79,I'll put it out.>> I don't want to lose no more.
488,00:30:36.21,00:30:36.21,">> The dangerous thing aboutthat is, if, if Sugar has the"
489,00:30:41.04,00:30:41.04,"immunity idol, I think she'llbe more than likely to give it"
490,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,to Ace than to Jacquie.She won't give it to Kelly.
491,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,>> That's the only flip side.>> And who knows if she even
492,00:30:56.96,00:30:56.96,has it.>> I know.
493,00:30:58.67,00:30:58.67,"Like, voting Kelly tonight, itwould be a risk."
494,00:31:00.46,00:31:00.46,">> Yeah, if we vote off Kellytonight..."
495,00:31:02.17,00:31:02.17,">> It would be a risk.>> The deal was, whoever lost"
496,00:31:06.00,00:31:06.00,"the immunity challenge, ends uppicking up Sugar."
497,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"And, unfortunately, that's us.She could have the immunity"
498,00:31:12.21,00:31:12.21,"idol and the last thing wewant is for Ace, Sugar and"
499,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,Jacquie to become the power inthis tribe.
500,00:31:18.33,00:31:18.33,"So, what's the deal?>> No."
501,00:31:22.08,00:31:22.08,>> Not Kelly?Jacquie?
502,00:31:24.08,00:31:24.08,">> Yeah, Jacquie.>> Because if Sugar comes here"
503,00:31:26.75,00:31:26.75,"with the immunity idol, it'lltake..."
504,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,>> She'll share it amongthose three.
505,00:31:31.25,00:31:31.25,>> With Jacquie.>> She was close to Jacquie
506,00:31:33.04,00:31:33.04,and Ace.>> Which means they'll have
507,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,three.>> I don't want him to have any
508,00:31:38.50,00:31:38.50,"kind of power in our tribe,not even three."
509,00:31:41.25,00:31:41.25,"The closest he'll have is two.>> Nah, tell us how you feel."
510,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,>> I think Kelly.I think Kelly's the weakest
511,00:31:46.67,00:31:46.67,link.We were gonna vote out Sue next.
512,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,What's the difference in Sueand Kelly?
513,00:31:49.96,00:31:49.96,"Not a damn thing.>> The difference is, uh, Sugar"
514,00:31:52.29,00:31:52.29,"may have the immunity idol.Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie-- those"
515,00:31:56.25,00:31:56.25,three right now is real deadly.>> You cool?
516,00:32:02.25,00:32:02.25,">> Yeah.>> I was talking to Crystal,"
517,00:32:14.08,00:32:14.08,"GC, and Kenny.So I go... so I go, ""We can't"

525,00:32:33.21,00:32:33.21,allied...>> Matty told me that everybody
526,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,assumes that Sugar's gonna havethe idol coming back 'cause
527,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17,she'll be out there for fourdays now.
528,00:32:38.29,00:32:38.29,And they all want to vote meout.
529,00:32:41.67,00:32:41.67,I'm feeling totally on the outsright now.
530,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,"I'm really, really nervous.>> I work off my ass off in the"

534,00:33:36.25,00:33:36.25,>> I want to be with you guys.'Cause I'm on the outskirts of

536,00:33:43.88,00:33:43.88,they're not gonna bring me tothe end.
537,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,">> Jacquie seems very genuine.After I had a talk with Jacquie,"
538,00:33:50.08,00:33:50.08,I kind of wanted to go take outKelly before Jacquie.
539,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,"If we make the wrong choiceright now, it will hurt really"
540,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,bad later.So my mind is not made up right
