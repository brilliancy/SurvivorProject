2,00:00:03.04,00:00:03.04,Survivor: Despite having three of the
3,00:00:09.04,00:00:09.04,"strongest players in the game, including a former Olympic"
4,00:00:12.21,00:00:12.21,"athlete, the Fang tribe lost three challenges in a row."
5,00:00:15.38,00:00:15.38,"Fang is walking, literally walking!"
6,00:00:18.17,00:00:18.17,They thought they could turn things around by picking GC to
7,00:00:21.17,00:00:21.17,"be their leader. >> If I was volunteered, I'll"
8,00:00:23.12,00:00:23.12,take it. If they want me to roll with
9,00:00:24.46,00:00:24.46,"it, I mean, I'll do it. >> PROBST: But he quit after"
10,00:00:26.38,00:00:26.38,one day. >> We don't need a damn leader.
11,00:00:28.75,00:00:28.75,"I'm younger than all y'all, so what I'm being the leader for?"
12,00:00:31.08,00:00:31.08,>> PROBST: The Kota tribe was on a roll.
13,00:00:33.12,00:00:33.12,They were hard-working and upbeat.
14,00:00:35.21,00:00:35.21,>> I don't envision us losing ever.
15,00:00:38.25,00:00:38.25,>> PROBST: So it was a shock to everyone...
16,00:00:40.38,00:00:40.38,Fang wins reward! ...when Fang finally won a
17,00:00:43.92,00:00:43.92,challenge. (cheering)
18,00:00:48.42,00:00:48.42,They sent Sugar to Exile Island...
19,00:00:51.58,00:00:51.58,">> Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
20,00:00:53.21,00:00:53.21,(shrieks) >> ...thinking she was so weak
21,00:00:56.04,00:00:56.04,she'd never find the hidden immunity idol.
22,00:01:00.33,00:01:00.33,">> Oh, my God, I found it. Okay, I'm going to cry."
23,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,(laughs) >> PROBST: Sugar kept the idol
24,00:01:05.38,00:01:05.38,secret from everyone except her closest ally Ace.
25,00:01:11.75,00:01:11.75,"At the next immunity challenge, Fang won again."
26,00:01:14.92,00:01:14.92,(cheering) Fang wins immunity!
27,00:01:18.50,00:01:18.50,"In their first trip to Tribal Council, Kota demonstrated"
28,00:01:22.17,00:01:22.17,their tribe unity by voting out their smallest and weakest
29,00:01:25.50,00:01:25.50,"player in a landslide. Paloma's lone ally was Kelly,"
30,00:01:29.58,00:01:29.58,"who voted for Ace. Paloma, the tribe has spoken."
31,00:01:33.88,00:01:33.88,15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
32,00:01:48.67,00:01:48.67,">> Well, that kind of sucked. I don't really want to do that"
33,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,anymore. >> I really didn't like that.
34,00:01:53.00,00:01:53.00,">> Me, neither. >> We just got back from Tribal"
35,00:01:56.17,00:01:56.17,Council. Paloma got voted off.
36,00:01:58.67,00:01:58.67,"I definitely lost a partner in the game who I can, like, talk"
37,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,to about things. And now I'm worried about
38,00:02:05.00,00:02:05.00,the chopping block. But things can change all the
39,00:02:07.54,00:02:07.54,time. My strategy right now is I
40,00:02:09.79,00:02:09.79,want Ace off. I just don't like Ace.
41,00:02:13.50,00:02:13.50,>> How do you feel about Tribal? How was it for you?
42,00:02:16.79,00:02:16.79,>> It was a bloody godawful experience.
43,00:02:19.21,00:02:19.21,Tribal Council was probably one of the most un-pleasurable
44,00:02:22.21,00:02:22.21,things I have done in recent history.
45,00:02:24.75,00:02:24.75,"It was, uh, right there with my wisdom teeth being pulled."
46,00:02:28.12,00:02:28.12,That was not fun going there. >> No.
47,00:02:32.92,00:02:32.92,>> I didn't know she had that much pent-up animosity towards
48,00:02:35.04,00:02:35.04,"me. >> I didn't, either."
49,00:02:36.12,00:02:36.12,">> I think Kelly voted for me, and, uh, she will be the next"
50,00:02:39.33,00:02:39.33,lamb to the slaughter. (theme song playing)

53,00:04:02.79,00:04:02.79,>> Do you think I could try cooking some sweet rice?
54,00:04:07.58,00:04:07.58,>> Have you seen the rice? We're over halfway done.
55,00:04:14.29,00:04:14.29,>> We-we should be eating one meal a day right now and...
56,00:04:20.08,00:04:20.08,"Uh, I will, I will make my speech, and then I'm going to"
57,00:04:23.96,00:04:23.96,"shut up, and you guys can decide."
58,00:04:25.79,00:04:25.79,"But we need to be eating one meal a day, period."
59,00:04:28.75,00:04:28.75,We're all going to be hungry. That's why it's called Survivor.
60,00:04:33.08,00:04:33.08,"The rice, quite simply, is running out."
61,00:04:36.08,00:04:36.08,"Strategically, I know that Crystal, Kenny, and GC are not"
62,00:04:40.83,00:04:40.83,with me. They hadn't listened to a word
63,00:04:42.21,00:04:42.21,I've said since I've been here. >> I'll catch up with you guys.
64,00:04:47.12,00:04:47.12,"Matty, Susie, and Dan, they're not my allies, but they're my"
65,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,friends. And I'm just not sure how to
66,00:04:53.83,00:04:53.83,play it right now. >> I ain't never seen Dan go
67,00:04:56.12,00:04:56.12,"pick fruit a day since we've been here, and all of a sudden,"
68,00:04:58.17,00:04:58.17,he going to go pick some fruit. >> Exactly.
69,00:04:59.92,00:04:59.92,They're going to go talk right now.
70,00:05:01.58,00:05:01.58,They got four r-right now. There's three of us here.
71,00:05:03.79,00:05:03.79,>> That's four. >> And there's four there.
72,00:05:05.04,00:05:05.04,"So they could be trying to do, you know, something right now."
73,00:05:08.12,00:05:08.12,"All I know, it seem like the tightest three is right here."
74,00:05:12.21,00:05:12.21,>> Those three alienated me from the beginning.
75,00:05:14.25,00:05:14.25,>> Th-They alienate everybody. >> I could tell GC the sky is
76,00:05:17.21,00:05:17.21,"blue, and he's gonna argue with me."
77,00:05:18.62,00:05:18.62,">> Matty's having a hard time with Crystal, and I'm having a"
78,00:05:20.33,00:05:20.33,hard time with Crystal. >> She's hard for me to deal
79,00:05:22.04,00:05:22.04,"with. >> And Kenny, he-he's like"
80,00:05:24.04,00:05:24.04,Mini-Me to GC. >> And then GC is given and he
81,00:05:27.62,00:05:27.62,"accepts the role as leader, and he flails and he gives it back."
82,00:05:31.46,00:05:31.46,">> We have a cancer, and this cancer's name is GC."
83,00:05:35.25,00:05:35.25,"And at the right time, this cancer is going to have to be"
84,00:05:37.75,00:05:37.75,cut out. We are all totally on the same
85,00:05:40.38,00:05:40.38,"page with this. >> No matter what, Susie."
86,00:05:42.04,00:05:42.04,>> No matter what. >> I finally feel like I've
87,00:05:44.00,00:05:44.00,"solidified my four with Dan, Randy, and Susie."
88,00:05:47.38,00:05:47.38,"And I really, truly feel that this alliance that I've-- we've"
89,00:05:50.92,00:05:50.92,created is going to be solid for a while.
90,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,Think it's going to carry me pretty far.
91,00:05:55.08,00:05:55.08,>> We don't need to talk about this anymore.
92,00:05:56.33,00:05:56.33,>> No. >> Just put it in.
93,00:05:58.92,00:05:58.92,>> All that matters is the four of us.
94,00:06:04.96,00:06:04.96,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Kota, come on in."
95,00:06:16.29,00:06:16.29,Fang getting your first look at the new Kota.
96,00:06:20.08,00:06:20.08,Paloma voted out at the last Tribal Council.
97,00:06:24.92,00:06:24.92,You guys ready to get to it? >> Yeah.
98,00:06:26.88,00:06:26.88,>> Absolutely. >> PROBST: You've been out here
99,00:06:28.08,00:06:28.08,"ten days, know each other pretty well."
100,00:06:30.79,00:06:30.79,Now we're going to put that knowledge to use.
101,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,"Today, you are going to rank your tribe from top to bottom"
102,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,according to importance in your tribe.
103,00:06:40.92,00:06:40.92,One would be the highest ranking; you'll work your way
104,00:06:43.38,00:06:43.38,"down. Once you're finished, I'll have"
105,00:06:45.21,00:06:45.21,you take your spot according to rank on the colored pedestal.
106,00:06:49.92,00:06:49.92,Got a tally board for each of you.
107,00:06:52.67,00:06:52.67,Don't unwrap these yet. You will fill these out in
108,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,"private. Find a spot on the beach, get"
109,00:07:00.12,00:07:00.12,"started. >> PROBST: All right, this is"
110,00:07:16.29,00:07:16.29,how you guys ranked yourselves in terms of importance.
111,00:07:24.00,00:07:24.00,The person that Kota ranked as the most important on their
112,00:07:27.46,00:07:27.46,tribe is Marcus. >> I'm totally shocked to be
113,00:07:31.83,00:07:31.83,ranked number one. I was just happy that they felt
114,00:07:34.25,00:07:34.25,"that way about me. On the other hand, are they"
115,00:07:36.08,00:07:36.08,going to start thinking that maybe that's a threat that
116,00:07:37.79,00:07:37.79,"needs to be, uh, moved off to the side as quickly as possible?"
117,00:07:41.25,00:07:41.25,>> PROBST: Person voted second-most important on
118,00:07:43.54,00:07:43.54,the Kota tribe: Ace. Third: Bob.
119,00:07:48.54,00:07:48.54,Fourth: Charlie. Fifth for the Kota tribe:
120,00:07:53.17,00:07:53.17,Jacquie. Sixth: Corinne.
121,00:07:58.04,00:07:58.04,The seventh: Sugar. Leaving Kelly as the least
122,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,"valuable member of the tribe. Kelly, how's it feel?"
123,00:08:07.67,00:08:07.67,>> It's interesting. Being the last one.
124,00:08:10.79,00:08:10.79,"I've never been the last picked ever, so it's kind of different."
125,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,">> Kelly's devastated. ""Why am I picked last?"
126,00:08:18.42,00:08:18.42,"Why is everybody not kissing my ass?"""
127,00:08:20.25,00:08:20.25,"'Cause you're a whiny little cow, and, um... you don't do"
128,00:08:25.29,00:08:25.29,anything. >> PROBST: On the number one
129,00:08:30.50,00:08:30.50,pedestal for Fang: Matty. Second on the Fang tribe: Dan.
130,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,Third: Randy. Fourth: Crystal.
131,00:08:43.04,00:08:43.04,">> What the hell? I'm out there busting my butt,"
132,00:08:46.25,00:08:46.25,and then they're going to rank me number four after someone who
133,00:08:49.83,00:08:49.83,"can't even barely walk and barely do anything, and all he"
134,00:08:52.54,00:08:52.54,does is sit around and fuss and curse everyone?
135,00:08:55.67,00:08:55.67,I was very insulted when I saw that.
136,00:08:59.38,00:08:59.38,>> PROBST: Fifth for the Fang tribe: Ken.
137,00:09:03.25,00:09:03.25,Sixth: GC. >> Wow.
138,00:09:07.17,00:09:07.17,"Kenny got picked before me? Damn, this is, this is not"
139,00:09:10.50,00:09:10.50,looking too good. (chuckles)
140,00:09:12.12,00:09:12.12,"Yeah, this is not looking too good for a pimp out here."
141,00:09:14.96,00:09:14.96,>> PROBST: Leaving Susie as the least valuable tribe member.
142,00:09:20.12,00:09:20.12,So this is it. This is how you guys ranked
143,00:09:23.08,00:09:23.08,"yourselves. Marcus, any surprises to you on"
144,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,the Fang tribe? >> I'm surprised Randy is up as
145,00:09:29.54,00:09:29.54,high as he is. I really thought that we'd see a
146,00:09:32.04,00:09:32.04,girl in the top two or three on their tribe.
147,00:09:34.33,00:09:34.33,"So that comes as a surprise. >> PROBST: Randy, you're"
148,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,getting a sneak peek inside the Kota tribe.
149,00:09:40.46,00:09:40.46,What kind of insight do you take from this?
150,00:09:42.92,00:09:42.92,>> I really don't think anything.
151,00:09:44.96,00:09:44.96,">> PROBST: Really? >> I mean, this shows"
152,00:09:47.42,00:09:47.42,"friendliness; this shows physicality in, uh, challenges,"
153,00:09:50.29,00:09:50.29,but it doesn't show a thing about who's hooking up with who.
154,00:09:56.21,00:09:56.21,">> PROBST: All right. Well, now you're going to take"
155,00:09:58.08,00:09:58.08,all this insight and put it to good use because we are picking
156,00:10:02.08,00:10:02.08,new tribes. >> What?!
157,00:10:04.92,00:10:04.92,">> No, no, no. >> Oh, no."
158,00:10:06.79,00:10:06.79,"Oh, wow. >> PROBST: Drop your buffs."
159,00:10:09.62,00:10:09.62,>> No! (groaning)
160,00:10:15.00,00:10:15.00,">> I had it all perfect. Dan, Randy, and Susie and I"
161,00:10:18.38,00:10:18.38,"solidified our foursome, and I was super content with it."
162,00:10:21.50,00:10:21.50,I was happy. I was comfortable with that
163,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,"foursome. And then Jeff's like, ""We're"
164,00:10:27.21,00:10:27.21,"going to switch teams."" And I was just like, ""Oh, no."""
165,00:10:30.25,00:10:30.25,That was just such a buzz-kill. I didn't even want to hear that.
166,00:10:33.75,00:10:33.75,>> PROBST: Here's how it is going to work.
167,00:10:35.54,00:10:35.54,"Marcus and Matty, because you were voted the most"
168,00:10:37.83,00:10:37.83,"important person in your tribe, you will remain members of that"
169,00:10:41.12,00:10:41.12,"tribe. You will be captains, and you"
170,00:10:43.21,00:10:43.21,will get us started on picking new tribes.
171,00:10:45.54,00:10:45.54,Marcus take a spot on the Kota mat.
172,00:10:47.75,00:10:47.75,"Matty, take a spot on the Fong mat."
173,00:10:49.83,00:10:49.83,">> Oh, no. >> PROBST: Kota will choose"
174,00:10:51.50,00:10:51.50,"first. Marcus, you're now going to"
175,00:10:53.00,00:10:53.00,choose somebody from the Fang tribe.
176,00:10:55.08,00:10:55.08,Who are you going to select to be your first tribe member?
177,00:10:58.04,00:10:58.04,>> I'm going to take Dan. >> PROBST: Dan joins Marcus on
178,00:11:01.46,00:11:01.46,"the new Kota tribe. Matty, make your first"
179,00:11:04.08,00:11:04.08,selection. You're choosing somebody from
180,00:11:05.29,00:11:05.29,Kota. >> I'm going to take Ace.
181,00:11:07.58,00:11:07.58,>> PROBST: Ace joins Matty on the new Fang tribe.
182,00:11:11.12,00:11:11.12,"All right, Dan. You are now choosing somebody"
183,00:11:13.38,00:11:13.38,from Kota. >> Charlie.
184,00:11:16.92,00:11:16.92,>> PROBST: Charlie joins his old teammate Marcus and his new
185,00:11:20.00,00:11:20.00,"tribe member, Dan. >> I am thrilled to be with"
186,00:11:23.92,00:11:23.92,Marcus. My biggest fear in this game is
187,00:11:25.62,00:11:25.62,that Marcus and I would separate because we have each other's
188,00:11:28.67,00:11:28.67,"backs, like... I just love Marcus."
189,00:11:31.38,00:11:31.38,"(laughing) >> PROBST: Ace, you are now"
190,00:11:34.25,00:11:34.25,choosing somebody from the Fang tribe.

192,00:11:38.33,00:11:38.33,">> PROBST: Crystal, first woman selected."
193,00:11:41.04,00:11:41.04,"Charlie, you are now choosing somebody from Fang."
194,00:11:43.79,00:11:43.79,>> Randy. (clicking tongue)
195,00:11:45.12,00:11:45.12,>> PROBST: Randy on the new Kota.
196,00:11:47.25,00:11:47.25,">> PROBST: Crystal, you are choosing somebody from the Kota"
197,00:11:49.21,00:11:49.21,tribe. >> I'm going to go with Jacquie.
198,00:11:52.83,00:11:52.83,">> PROBST: Jacquie joins Crystal, Matty, and Ace."

200,00:11:59.96,00:11:59.96,>> Corinne. >> PROBST: Corinne joins Marcus
201,00:12:03.00,00:12:03.00,"and Charlie, Dan, and Randy. Jacquie, you are now choosing"
202,00:12:06.12,00:12:06.12,somebody from the Fang tribe. >> I'm going to go with Ken.
203,00:12:09.46,00:12:09.46,">> PROBST: Ken joins Matty, Crystal, Ace, and Jacquie."
204,00:12:12.71,00:12:12.71,"All right, Corinne, your choice. Are you choosing somebody from"
205,00:12:15.88,00:12:15.88,Fang. You have only two choices:
206,00:12:18.42,00:12:18.42,"GC, who was ranked number six, or Susie, who is ranked last."
207,00:12:31.79,00:12:31.79,>> It doesn't matter who they pick; it's a game. 
208,00:12:33.25,00:12:33.25,">> PROBST: All right, Corinne. I hope the information you're"
209,00:12:34.75,00:12:34.75,"getting is good info. >> Well, I don't want to be the"
210,00:12:37.21,00:12:37.21,"only girl, so we're going to take Susie."
211,00:12:39.58,00:12:39.58,Come on over. >> PROBST: Corinne chooses
212,00:12:41.29,00:12:41.29,"Susie, leaving GC as the last remaining member of Fang."
213,00:12:48.25,00:12:48.25,"GC, nobody chose you. >> Well, it's cool."
214,00:12:53.21,00:12:53.21,You know. It doesn't feel good.
215,00:12:55.21,00:12:55.21,"But the last few days have been pretty hard for me, and I think"
216,00:12:58.17,00:12:58.17,I probably rubbed a few people the wrong way.
217,00:13:00.96,00:13:00.96,">> PROBST: All right, Ken, you're now making a selection."
218,00:13:03.83,00:13:03.83,"You're choosing between three remaining Kota members, Bob,"
219,00:13:07.58,00:13:07.58,"Sugar, and Kelly. >> I don't know Kelly."
220,00:13:13.08,00:13:13.08,>> No? >> PROBST: Bob still left up
221,00:13:17.92,00:13:17.92,"there. Bob, a little surprised?"
222,00:13:20.04,00:13:20.04,"You were ranked so high by your own tribe, and yet nobody's"
223,00:13:23.21,00:13:23.21,chosen you? Are you a diamond in the rough?
224,00:13:26.33,00:13:26.33,Are they missing some gold here? >> Um...
225,00:13:30.04,00:13:30.04,"I think so, but that...  You know, time will tell."
226,00:13:44.12,00:13:44.12,">> PROBST: All right, Ken, make your choice."
227,00:13:47.21,00:13:47.21,">> Jeff, for myself, I've always been last picked sometimes and"
228,00:13:50.79,00:13:50.79,"I know how it feels to be left out, so I'm going to go with"
229,00:13:53.29,00:13:53.29,"Kelly. I want to get to know her, and"
230,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,she's hot. (laughter)
231,00:13:56.92,00:13:56.92,>> PROBST: That may be the most surprising decision in ten days
232,00:14:00.83,00:14:00.83,"out here, Ken. Susie, you're choosing between"
233,00:14:04.92,00:14:04.92,"Bob, ranked the third most valuable tribe member, or"
234,00:14:08.12,00:14:08.12,"Sugar, ranked next to last. >> I'm going to go with Bob."
235,00:14:11.54,00:14:11.54,">> PROBST: Finally, Bob joins Susie, Marcus, Charlie,"
236,00:14:15.38,00:14:15.38,"Corinne, Dan, and Randy. >> PROBST: Kelly, you have one"
237,00:14:19.17,00:14:19.17,choice. >> G-Sizzle.
238,00:14:22.33,00:14:22.33,>> G-Sizzle! Come back home.
239,00:14:25.08,00:14:25.08,">> PROBST: GC joins Kelly, Matty, Ken, Crystal, Ace, and"
240,00:14:30.17,00:14:30.17,"Jacquie. The new Fang tribe, which"
241,00:14:33.33,00:14:33.33,"leaves you, Sugar. >> What does that mean?"
242,00:14:36.67,00:14:36.67,>> PROBST: You will go to Exile Island.
243,00:14:38.71,00:14:38.71,">> Aah! >> Oh, no!"
244,00:14:42.46,00:14:42.46,>> PROBST: You will remain on Exile until after the next
245,00:14:45.75,00:14:45.75,Tribal Council. You will then join the tribe
246,00:14:49.33,00:14:49.33,"that loses a member, evening us up at 7-7."
247,00:14:54.54,00:14:54.54,Ready to head to Exile? >> Yeah.
248,00:14:56.54,00:14:56.54,>> PROBST: Here is a map. Not that you don't know the way.
249,00:15:01.46,00:15:01.46,>> Bye. >> PROBST: It's going to be a
250,00:15:03.54,00:15:03.54,"long stay out there, Sugar. >> Bye."
251,00:15:06.21,00:15:06.21,">> PROBST: Kota, new tribe buffs."
252,00:15:08.54,00:15:08.54,"Fresh, clean. >> Yes!"
253,00:15:10.38,00:15:10.38,">> PROBST: Fang, new tribe buffs."
254,00:15:12.04,00:15:12.04,"All right, we have our new tribes."
255,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,"For some of you, this is a brand-new start."
256,00:15:16.38,00:15:16.38,"For others, it could mean the end of your game."
257,00:15:19.00,00:15:19.00,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
258,00:15:41.88,00:15:41.88,">> You guys, this is your new home."
259,00:15:43.08,00:15:43.08,"Feel comfortable. >> Welcome hone, guys."
260,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,>> You guys are really going to like it here.
261,00:15:46.88,00:15:46.88,">> Oh, my God. >> I'm so happy."
262,00:15:49.50,00:15:49.50,>> Look at this. >> This tribe has a completely
263,00:15:51.46,00:15:51.46,"different personality. If Matty was here, it would be,"
264,00:15:53.88,00:15:53.88,"like, the perfect tribe. >> The new Kota tribe is four"
265,00:15:56.62,00:15:56.62,"Kota members: Bob, Marcus, Corinne, and Charlie;"
266,00:16:00.21,00:16:00.21,three old Fang members: Susie and Dan and me.
267,00:16:03.96,00:16:03.96,"If Kota loses the next challenge, I do think the"
268,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,original Kota will stick together and pick one of the
269,00:16:09.79,00:16:09.79,"three Fang members off. If it's not me, I'll go along"
270,00:16:13.38,00:16:13.38,"with it. If it is me, I'll burn the camp"
271,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,down. >> This is unbelievable.
272,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,"It's, like, the most comfortable thing I've sat on in a week."
273,00:16:21.29,00:16:21.29,">> Bob works in his sleep, too. He wakes up every hour."
274,00:16:22.92,00:16:22.92,">> Yeah, Bob wakes up in the middle of the night and builds"
275,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,stuff. He's going to build us some
276,00:16:25.50,00:16:25.50,"bunk beds, I think. >> Unbelievable."
277,00:16:27.00,00:16:27.00,">> He's awesome, Bob. The Kota tribe has it together."
278,00:16:29.29,00:16:29.29,They're just functioning really well.
279,00:16:31.38,00:16:31.38,"I see Bob is their worker, and I think Marcus and Corinne and"
280,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,"Charlie, they really appreciate that."
281,00:16:37.21,00:16:37.21,"So, my strategy right now at Kota is to just keep working"
282,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,hard at camp. And I'm hoping that they see
283,00:16:43.75,00:16:43.75,"that as a positive and say, ""She's worth keeping."""
284,00:16:57.58,00:16:57.58,">> Comfort time! When I got to Exile, there was"
285,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,a choice between comfort and the clue.
286,00:17:03.96,00:17:03.96,"And I already have the idol, so I chose comfort."
287,00:17:07.71,00:17:07.71,"Home, sweet home. I walked up to my Sugar shack."
288,00:17:12.17,00:17:12.17,It was like Christmas morning. There was pineapple and oranges
289,00:17:16.71,00:17:16.71,"and apples and coconut. Oh, my God."
290,00:17:23.67,00:17:23.67,This is so good. (laughing)
291,00:17:32.08,00:17:32.08,(sighs) This game is so crazy because
292,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,I don't know what team I'm going to be on when I get back.
293,00:17:38.88,00:17:38.88,"I'm hoping that I go back to Fang, so that I can be with Ace."
294,00:17:43.96,00:17:43.96,"And hopefully they'll vote off Kelly, and then I can come take"
295,00:17:47.38,00:17:47.38,her spot. I'm sure they will.
296,00:17:50.08,00:17:50.08,"They're not idiots. >> All right, guys."
297,00:18:05.04,00:18:05.04,Welcome to Fang! >> I like it.
298,00:18:07.46,00:18:07.46,>> This is our home. >> Is it different than your
299,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,guys' house? >> Yeah.
300,00:18:11.62,00:18:11.62,">> Really? >> I mean, the hut looks"
301,00:18:13.04,00:18:13.04,similar. >> This tribe switch is great
302,00:18:15.50,00:18:15.50,for me. I still got four people of my
303,00:18:17.92,00:18:17.92,"original tribe, and I think it is great, you know what I mean?"
304,00:18:20.79,00:18:20.79,I don't think I could be in a better position right now.
305,00:18:22.29,00:18:22.29,">> If we walk around and pull ginger, you can cut the root"
306,00:18:24.83,00:18:24.83,and you can put it right into the rice.
307,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,>> Yeah. >> Same with the watercress.
308,00:18:27.88,00:18:27.88,">> Oh, yeah, and ferns. >> We can't find the ginger."
309,00:18:29.42,00:18:29.42,">> Oh, I can show you it. >> Oh!"
310,00:18:32.21,00:18:32.21,Thank you! Thank you! >> Yeah.
311,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,>> Because you guys didn't really invite anybody else with
312,00:18:59.88,00:18:59.88,"you guys wherever you went. >> Listening to Kelly talk, she"
313,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,felt like an outcast. She felt like she needed to
314,00:19:08.83,00:19:08.83,"belong somewhere, and maybe she really does belong with Fang."
315,00:19:14.75,00:19:14.75,>> I was starting to count down the days and the hours.
316,00:19:18.04,00:19:18.04,">> Not much we can do, but... >> Yeah."
317,00:19:29.75,00:19:29.75,">> I don't know, it's so weird. They are just so fake."
318,00:19:31.62,00:19:31.62,"Like, I'm a salesperson. I know I can analyze people and,"
319,00:19:35.46,00:19:35.46,"like, get along with all personalities."
320,00:19:36.96,00:19:36.96,"And even change my personality, and act like something"
321,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,"sometimes. But, to them, it was just like,"
322,00:19:41.54,00:19:41.54,"I would sit there and just, like, listen to them."
323,00:19:44.62,00:19:44.62,I definitely would rather jump ship and go with Fang than I
324,00:19:47.83,00:19:47.83,"would with old Kota. 'Cause, you know what?"
325,00:19:49.42,00:19:49.42,They didn't even give me a chance.
326,00:19:50.88,00:19:50.88,And I think Crystal and G-Sizzle and Ken have something going on.
327,00:19:55.83,00:19:55.83,"So, I definitely want to be a part of that because they"
328,00:19:57.62,00:19:57.62,overrule all the votes. >> What you see.
329,00:20:02.12,00:20:02.12,"(imitating): ""Cool, awesome!"" ""What's up? Like, cool!"""
330,00:20:09.62,00:20:09.62,">> Oh, he's got two. >> Oh, he pimp daddy."
331,00:20:12.08,00:20:12.08,>> Sweet! >> He's pimp daddy Ace.
332,00:20:16.67,00:20:16.67,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
333,00:20:17.42,00:20:17.42,">> Oh, my God. Duh. My girl. >> Uh, cha-ching."
334,00:20:23.42,00:20:23.42,">> Okay, it can be done. >> That's money in the bank."
335,00:20:26.08,00:20:26.08,>> The numbers are here. >> When I saw Kelly on that mat
336,00:20:28.46,00:20:28.46,"and she was the last one picked, I knew I could sway her to my"
337,00:20:31.96,00:20:31.96,side because she did not get along with Kota.
338,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,"Oh, yeah, she's also hot. There you go."
339,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,">> I know. I'm so happy that I get to,"
340,00:20:41.46,00:20:41.46,"like, talk, and you guys, like, talk back."
341,00:20:43.54,00:20:43.54,">> Right now, I am only using her for a vote."
342,00:21:07.04,00:21:07.04,">> We got tree mail! >> Oh, my God."
343,00:21:09.58,00:21:09.58,"It's a lacrosse stick. >> Oh, crap."
344,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,>> Is that a ball? >> Yeah.
345,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,">> Aw! >> ""Practice, practice, shoot"
346,00:21:15.17,00:21:15.17,"and toss. Like water polo meets lacrosse,"
347,00:21:18.08,00:21:18.08,"Time to show them who is boss, You can never afford an"
348,00:21:21.08,00:21:21.08,"immunity loss."" I really am trying physically"
349,00:21:24.92,00:21:24.92,"to try my best, but, man, this game takes a toll on a"
350,00:21:27.29,00:21:27.29,47-year-old woman like me. (laughs)
351,00:21:29.46,00:21:29.46,It just does. >> You use your left hand and
352,00:21:32.04,00:21:32.04,your right. It will go faster. 
353,00:21:33.79,00:21:33.79,"Here, somebody else can try. >> I don't know that Randy and"
354,00:21:36.79,00:21:36.79,Susie can really pull their weight when it comes to the
355,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17,challenges themselves. I think it will be really hard
356,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,"to put Randy out before Susie, but it's certainly not out of"
357,00:21:45.67,00:21:45.67,the question. Susie is doing a great job
358,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,around camp. And if Randy has a poor
359,00:21:49.88,00:21:49.88,performance on a challenge and he's not really doing much
360,00:21:51.71,00:21:51.71,"around camp, shoot, I would rather keep Susie around."
361,00:21:54.00,00:21:54.00,"The question will really be, ""How does Randy perform when it"
362,00:21:58.08,00:21:58.08,"comes time to do the challenges?"""
363,00:22:03.62,00:22:03.62,(all laughing) >> Randy.
364,00:22:16.12,00:22:16.12,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
365,00:22:18.25,00:22:18.25,>> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first.
366,00:22:19.79,00:22:19.79,"GC, take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up"
367,00:22:27.46,00:22:27.46,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
368,00:22:30.08,00:22:30.08,"each have a raft and a paddle. On my go, I'll toss a ball into"
369,00:22:34.21,00:22:34.21,the water. You will race to gain
370,00:22:35.92,00:22:35.92,"possession of the ball. Using your paddles, you will"
371,00:22:38.71,00:22:38.71,pass the ball from one tribe mate to another until you are
372,00:22:41.83,00:22:41.83,close enough that you can toss the ball into your opponent's
373,00:22:44.96,00:22:44.96,"goal, scoring a point for your tribe."
374,00:22:47.04,00:22:47.04,"First tribe to three wins immunity, is safe in this game."
375,00:22:51.33,00:22:51.33,Losers go to Tribal Council where the fourth person will be
376,00:22:54.58,00:22:54.58,voted out. Make sense?
377,00:22:56.92,00:22:56.92,>> ALL: Yes. >> PROBST: We'll get you in the
378,00:22:59.12,00:22:59.12,boats. We'll get started.
379,00:23:05.50,00:23:05.50,"All right, here we go. For immunity."
380,00:23:07.96,00:23:07.96,It takes three points to win. Survivors ready?
381,00:23:12.67,00:23:12.67,Go! These boats are not easy to
382,00:23:19.75,00:23:19.75,control. Maneuvering is going to be half
383,00:23:22.25,00:23:22.25,the battle. Your goal is to pass from one
384,00:23:25.96,00:23:25.96,tribe mate to another until you are close enough to score.
385,00:23:30.33,00:23:30.33,>> That's my girl! >> PROBST: Jacquie going to get
386,00:23:32.96,00:23:32.96,"to the ball first for Fang. Jacquie has it, loses it"
387,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,quickly. Jacquie struggling now to get
388,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,"back to it. Marcus taking his time, scoops"
389,00:23:44.92,00:23:44.92,it up easily. Ace in the goalie position.
390,00:23:48.96,00:23:48.96,"Marcus just moving it down, nobody even attacking Marcus."
391,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,"Crystal just watching. >> Get it, Ken!"
392,00:23:54.83,00:23:54.83,>> PROBST: Kelly not doing anything.
393,00:23:56.62,00:23:56.62,Kenny can't do anything. Marcus passes in closer to
394,00:23:59.75,00:23:59.75,Randy. Randy's got it.
395,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,"Going to take a shot at the goal, and he scores!"
396,00:24:05.50,00:24:05.50,Just like that. >> Take that! 
397,00:24:07.25,00:24:07.25,Let's go! Come on! >> PROBST: Kota on the board.
398,00:24:10.75,00:24:10.75,">> That's a boy, Randy! >> PROBST: Here we go."
399,00:24:19.54,00:24:19.54,"Kota leads, 1-zip. Playing to three."
400,00:24:21.42,00:24:21.42,Survivors ready? Go!
401,00:24:28.04,00:24:28.04,"Matty out quickly for Fang. >> Come on, Matty! Get to it!"
402,00:24:31.25,00:24:31.25,>> PROBST: Marcus fighting to get there first.
403,00:24:33.38,00:24:33.38,Kelly making no progress. Ace now out of the goalie
404,00:24:36.75,00:24:36.75,spot using his hands. He's now out on the course.
405,00:24:42.08,00:24:42.08,Marcus going to get there first for Kota.
406,00:24:48.21,00:24:48.21,Marcus with a nice little pass to himself.
407,00:24:52.71,00:24:52.71,Marcus like he's done this before.
408,00:24:55.33,00:24:55.33,">> Kelly, get up there, too! >> Kelly!"
409,00:24:58.21,00:24:58.21,"Kelly, the ball! >> Come on, Kelly! Get to it!"
410,00:25:01.92,00:25:01.92,">> Get over there, Randy. >> Randy's open!"
411,00:25:03.62,00:25:03.62,>> Take your time. Take your time.
412,00:25:06.12,00:25:06.12,>> PROBST: Kelly not doing much. Marcus passes down to Randy.
413,00:25:11.46,00:25:11.46,He's got a free goal if he can get to it.
414,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,">> Randy, go! >> PROBST: Nobody on the Fang"
415,00:25:15.79,00:25:15.79,goal! How does that happen?
416,00:25:18.54,00:25:18.54,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Kota scores their
417,00:25:20.79,00:25:20.79,"second point. >> Nice, guys, nice!"
418,00:25:22.96,00:25:22.96,>> Good job! >> PROBST: Fang could not make 
419,00:25:24.88,00:25:24.88,that easier! >> I can't control the boat.
420,00:25:31.50,00:25:31.50,>> PROBST: Here we go. Kota leads 2-zip.
421,00:25:33.58,00:25:33.58,It only takes three to win. Survivors ready?
422,00:25:40.00,00:25:40.00,Go! Marcus once again out quickly
423,00:25:50.75,00:25:50.75,for Kota. Ace racing to get possession.
424,00:25:54.75,00:25:54.75,Marcus once again gets to the ball first.
425,00:25:57.29,00:25:57.29,">> Nice, Ace, get to it! >> PROBST: Trying to control it."
426,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,Loses it to Ace. Ace having trouble getting back
427,00:26:08.38,00:26:08.38,to it. Kelly just hanging back.
428,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,Marcus tosses it between Kenny and Crystal and now
429,00:26:21.04,00:26:21.04,"Marcus is going to pass Kenny. >> Come on, Kenny, go!"
430,00:26:25.25,00:26:25.25,>> PROBST: Kenny virtually useless in this challenge.
431,00:26:31.00,00:26:31.00,">> Ace, yeah! >> Atta, boys!"
432,00:26:34.33,00:26:34.33,>> PROBST: Ace coming to get in on this.
433,00:26:36.96,00:26:36.96,">> Marcus, do it! >> Watch out. Ace is behind you."
434,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,">> PROBST: No hands! >> Let's go, Marcus!"
435,00:26:41.96,00:26:41.96,">> Give it to me, man. >> PROBST: Marcus tosses to"
436,00:26:44.58,00:26:44.58,Randy down close. Randy's got a shot on goal.
437,00:26:48.71,00:26:48.71,">> Randy, go for it! >> You've got this, Randy."
438,00:26:51.29,00:26:51.29,">> PROBST: This could do it. No, just short."
439,00:26:53.08,00:26:53.08,">> Yeah, Matty! >> PROBST: Dan and Matty"
440,00:26:57.88,00:26:57.88,fighting for that ball right at the goal.
441,00:27:00.46,00:27:00.46,"No, Matty with a great block! Dan, you're out of your boat."
442,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,You're not in it until you're  back in your boat.
443,00:27:06.04,00:27:06.04,">> Get to that corner! >> Oh, my God!"
444,00:27:08.17,00:27:08.17,"Go, Randy! >> PROBST: Ace knocks it out"
445,00:27:11.96,00:27:11.96,of Randy. Now Ace is out of his boat.
446,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Randy scores for
447,00:27:16.12,00:27:16.12,Kota! >> Yeah!
448,00:27:18.17,00:27:18.17,">> PROBST: Kota wins immunity. >> Yes, yeah!"
449,00:27:22.58,00:27:22.58,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: One of the most 
450,00:27:26.21,00:27:26.21,"lopsided challenges thus far. Kota, congratulations."
451,00:27:35.21,00:27:35.21,"Immunity and no Tribal Council. >> Thanks, Jeff. "
452,00:27:42.08,00:27:42.08,">> PROBST: Fang, without question, one of the worst"
453,00:27:44.88,00:27:44.88,performances I've seen at a  challenge.
454,00:27:47.92,00:27:47.92,I got nothing for you except a date with me tonight at Tribal
455,00:27:50.04,00:27:50.04,Council where today's performance will cost somebody
456,00:27:53.21,00:27:53.21,a shot at a million dollars. That's what you have to figure
457,00:27:57.46,00:27:57.46,out this afternoon.  Grab your stuff.
458,00:27:59.25,00:27:59.25,Head back to camp. See you at Tribal.
459,00:28:05.75,00:28:05.75,"Kota, congratulations. Grab your stuff."
460,00:28:07.71,00:28:07.71,Head back to camp. >> (tribal chanting)
461,00:28:32.38,00:28:32.38,(yawning fiercely) >> The immunity challenge was
462,00:28:55.08,00:28:55.08,so much fun. It was like we were legless
463,00:28:58.79,00:28:58.79,chickens racing against sleek weasels and losing badly
464,00:29:04.25,00:29:04.25,along the way. >> It seemed like the plan
465,00:29:06.92,00:29:06.92,"failed from the very start. >> Kenny, you okay?"
466,00:29:11.08,00:29:11.08,">> Yeah, I mean, I was... >> Kenny, you sucked out there."
467,00:29:15.50,00:29:15.50,">> I'm sorry. >> Kenny, you were stuck in the"
468,00:29:18.21,00:29:18.21,same spot. >> I don't understand how that
469,00:29:20.67,00:29:20.67,"worked. Like, 'cause I kept on turning"
470,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,around in circles. >> That was bad.
471,00:29:24.75,00:29:24.75,"That was bad, Kenny. >> You were pretty good,"
472,00:29:27.54,00:29:27.54,Jacquie. >> It's hard to play defense
473,00:29:30.71,00:29:30.71,"in that game. Should've, could've,"
474,00:29:33.12,00:29:33.12,would've. >> Over it.
475,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,>> Originally we were thinking about voting for Ace or Jacquie
476,00:29:44.00,00:29:44.00,"tonight, but judging by the way that Kelly performed today,"
477,00:29:47.71,00:29:47.71,Kelly's going home tonight is what I'm thinking.
478,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,"Um, I'm going to talk to the others."
479,00:29:51.96,00:29:51.96,"I'm going to talk to Kenny and Crystal, and I'm sure everybody"
480,00:29:54.62,00:29:54.62,will be fine with voting Kelly out tonight.
481,00:30:02.08,00:30:02.08,">> So, G, what do you think? >> I don't know."
482,00:30:06.21,00:30:06.21,"I think, uh... I think we should definitely"
483,00:30:10.25,00:30:10.25,"keep Ace. He's, uh, you seen him today."
484,00:30:12.46,00:30:12.46,"Yeah, I mean, um, but I think, I mean, maybe we should switch"
485,00:30:16.25,00:30:16.25,"it to Kelly, man. She kind of has a bad attitude"
486,00:30:19.33,00:30:19.33,about stuff and she... Jacquie did at least all right today.
487,00:30:24.54,00:30:24.54,Are you all cool with that? >> I'm good with Kelly.
488,00:30:27.79,00:30:27.79,I'll put it out. >> I don't want to lose no more.
489,00:30:36.21,00:30:36.21,">> The dangerous thing about that is, if, if Sugar has the"
490,00:30:41.04,00:30:41.04,"immunity idol, I think she'll be more than likely to give it"
491,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,to Ace than to Jacquie. She won't give it to Kelly.
492,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,>> That's the only flip side. >> And who knows if she even
493,00:30:56.96,00:30:56.96,has it. >> I know.
494,00:30:58.67,00:30:58.67,"Like, voting Kelly tonight, it would be a risk."
495,00:31:00.46,00:31:00.46,">> Yeah, if we vote off Kelly tonight..."
496,00:31:02.17,00:31:02.17,">> It would be a risk. >> The deal was, whoever lost"
497,00:31:06.00,00:31:06.00,"the immunity challenge, ends up picking up Sugar."
498,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"And, unfortunately, that's us. She could have the immunity"
499,00:31:12.21,00:31:12.21,"idol and the last thing we want is for Ace, Sugar and"
500,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,Jacquie to become the power in this tribe.
501,00:31:18.33,00:31:18.33,"So, what's the deal? >> No."
502,00:31:22.08,00:31:22.08,>> Not Kelly? Jacquie?
503,00:31:24.08,00:31:24.08,">> Yeah, Jacquie. >> Because if Sugar comes here"
504,00:31:26.75,00:31:26.75,"with the immunity idol, it'll take..."
505,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,>> She'll share it among those three.
506,00:31:31.25,00:31:31.25,>> With Jacquie. >> She was close to Jacquie
507,00:31:33.04,00:31:33.04,and Ace. >> Which means they'll have
508,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,three. >> I don't want him to have any
509,00:31:38.50,00:31:38.50,"kind of power in our tribe, not even three."
510,00:31:41.25,00:31:41.25,"The closest he'll have is two. >> Nah, tell us how you feel."
511,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,>> I think Kelly. I think Kelly's the weakest
512,00:31:46.67,00:31:46.67,link. We were gonna vote out Sue next.
513,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,What's the difference in Sue and Kelly?
514,00:31:49.96,00:31:49.96,"Not a damn thing. >> The difference is, uh, Sugar"
515,00:31:52.29,00:31:52.29,"may have the immunity idol. Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie-- those"
516,00:31:56.25,00:31:56.25,three right now is real deadly. >> You cool?
517,00:32:02.25,00:32:02.25,">> Yeah. >> I was talking to Crystal,"
518,00:32:14.08,00:32:14.08,"GC, and Kenny. So I go... so I go, ""We can't"
519,00:32:16.58,00:32:16.58,rid of the strong people; we can't get rid off the strong
520,00:32:18.92,00:32:18.92,"people; there's no way,"" and he started to believe me."
521,00:32:21.29,00:32:21.29,And then they wanted... then they were talking about taking
522,00:32:23.67,00:32:23.67,"out you, and I was, like, ""No, no, no, we can't take out"
523,00:32:26.12,00:32:26.12,"Jacquie, she's too strong, she's too strong, she's too strong,"""
524,00:32:28.04,00:32:28.04,"but they're, like, worried that you and Ace are allied, so when"
525,00:32:30.38,00:32:30.38,what's-her-face comes back that you and him are gonna be
526,00:32:33.21,00:32:33.21,allied... >> Matty told me that everybody
527,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,assumes that Sugar's gonna have the idol coming back 'cause
528,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17,she'll be out there for four days now.
529,00:32:38.29,00:32:38.29,And they all want to vote me out.
530,00:32:41.67,00:32:41.67,I'm feeling totally on the outs right now.
531,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,"I'm really, really nervous. >> I work off my ass off in the"
532,00:32:56.08,00:32:56.08,challenges. >> People are scared.
533,00:32:59.12,00:32:59.12,">> But you guys would still help, like..."
534,00:33:01.38,00:33:01.38,">> No, it's not that. It's just, like..."
535,00:33:36.25,00:33:36.25,>> I want to be with you guys. 'Cause I'm on the outskirts of
536,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,"anything, so if I try even to join with Ace and Sugar, I know"
537,00:33:43.88,00:33:43.88,they're not gonna bring me to the end.
538,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,">> Jacquie seems very genuine. After I had a talk with Jacquie,"
539,00:33:50.08,00:33:50.08,I kind of wanted to go take out Kelly before Jacquie.
540,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,"If we make the wrong choice right now, it will hurt really"
541,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,bad later. So my mind is not made up right
542,00:33:58.92,00:33:58.92,now. I can try to vote for Kelly
543,00:34:05.29,00:34:05.29,"tonight, but... it's not gonna do anything."
544,00:34:08.21,00:34:08.21,You really need to talk to Crystal.
545,00:34:16.54,00:34:16.54,">> It sucks. So, I just... like, I was, like,"
546,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,"""Well, is there any way that I could get in, like, a tight"
547,00:34:21.67,00:34:21.67,"alliance with you guys,"" you know?"
548,00:34:23.12,00:34:23.12,>> We thought you and... you and Ace were fairly close.
549,00:34:27.21,00:34:27.21,">> We never had an alliance. It would be awesome if we had,"
550,00:34:29.92,00:34:29.92,"like, a really strong united... >> You did a... you did a hell"
551,00:34:32.88,00:34:32.88,"of a job today. >> I worked my ass off, and I,"
552,00:34:34.71,00:34:34.71,"like, actually want to be here. >> Yeah, you played your ass"
553,00:34:36.79,00:34:36.79,off. >> Thank you.
554,00:34:38.17,00:34:38.17,">> I was, like, ""Damn."" >> I want to be here so bad..."
555,00:34:41.88,00:34:41.88,>> Jacquie is a nervous wreck. Jacquie was just pretty much
556,00:34:44.04,00:34:44.04,"begging and pleading with me, ""Crystal, please keep me in the"
557,00:34:46.42,00:34:46.42,game. I've tried so hard.
558,00:34:47.83,00:34:47.83,"I want to be here."" >> ...close with GC and Kenny?"
559,00:34:51.88,00:34:51.88,>> Yeah. >> 'Cause you guys need a
560,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,"fourth. >> Yeah, that's the thing."
561,00:34:55.29,00:34:55.29,">> I want to be the fourth so bad, please... (laughs)"
562,00:34:58.79,00:34:58.79,">> And the whole time she's talking to me, she's-she's"

564,00:35:04.12,00:35:04.12,"You know, because I'm, like, ""Damn, this girl played her ass"
565,00:35:06.17,00:35:06.17,"off today, and maybe she really does want to be here."""
566,00:35:08.67,00:35:08.67,>> I would be with you guys till the end.
567,00:35:11.46,00:35:11.46,"So anyways, I just wanted to talk to you 'cause I didn't get"
568,00:35:14.42,00:35:14.42,"to talk to you. And I'm, like... I'm, like,"
569,00:35:16.42,00:35:16.42,"""Kenny, I feel like... (continues indistinctly)"
570,00:35:20.79,00:35:20.79,">> As of right now, I don't know what to do because I need"
571,00:35:24.25,00:35:24.25,someone on my team that's gonna fight... and that's gonna work
572,00:35:27.62,00:35:27.62,"hard, you know, and that's what she is."

574,00:36:01.04,00:36:01.04,Tribal Council starring the Fang Tribe.
575,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,"GC, it's got to be getting old."
576,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,">> I like to see you, Jeff. But I don't like seeing you"
577,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"under these circumstances. You know, it's good to have the"
578,00:36:11.62,00:36:11.62,"strongest team as possible. Anytime you lose somebody, it"
579,00:36:15.04,00:36:15.04,"just hurts your team even more. >> PROBST: Matty, is that the"
580,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,criteria right now: Keep this tribe as strong as possible?
581,00:36:22.04,00:36:22.04,">> Yeah, according to Matty, it is."
582,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"And, uh, after today's performance, I was completely"
583,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,"embarrassed. So yeah, I want to keep this"
584,00:36:29.12,00:36:29.12,"tribe as strong as possible. >> PROBST: Kenny, let's talk"
585,00:36:32.96,00:36:32.96,"about the switch. You lose Dan, Randy, and Susie,"
586,00:36:36.88,00:36:36.88,"but you gain Jacquie, Ace, and Kelly."
587,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,"Can you trust them? >> Um, right now, in three days,"
588,00:36:43.96,00:36:43.96,"it's really hard to trust anybody, Jeff."
589,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,You have to build trust from the beginning and see who they
590,00:36:49.08,00:36:49.08,"really are, and that's how you trust somebody."
591,00:36:51.92,00:36:51.92,">> PROBST: Matty, do you trust Ace now, as a Fang member?"
592,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,">> I don't know if I trust Ace, but I want Ace on my side."
593,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,"He's a powerful contributor, and I want him on my team right now."
594,00:37:04.38,00:37:04.38,">> PROBST: Ace, should they trust you guys?"
595,00:37:06.50,00:37:06.50,">> You know, Ken's completely right."
596,00:37:08.21,00:37:08.21,"Until we prove ourselves, it's hard to be, like, ""Trust me,"
597,00:37:10.50,00:37:10.50,"trust me, trust me,"" even if we're telling the complete"
598,00:37:13.17,00:37:13.17,truth. Right now you go and try and
599,00:37:15.92,00:37:15.92,make us as strong as possible and just do what's best for the
600,00:37:18.46,00:37:18.46,"tribe. >> PROBST: Jacquie, how"
601,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,frustrating is it to come from a tribe that really had it
602,00:37:24.25,00:37:24.25,"together, to come to this tribe, where it's almost as if there's"
603,00:37:27.92,00:37:27.92,something in the water? You just... dissolve.
604,00:37:31.62,00:37:31.62,">> When I came to the tribe, I thought we would have, like,"
605,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,"awesome teamwork. Like, I thought we were for sure"
606,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,"gonna win any challenge over Kota Tribe, and I was working"
607,00:37:39.38,00:37:39.38,"my butt off. Like, I was hoping that we'd"
608,00:37:41.71,00:37:41.71,win. I definitely didn't want to be
609,00:37:43.62,00:37:43.62,"here. >> PROBST: Kelly, you haven't"
610,00:37:45.62,00:37:45.62,been with this tribe very long. Concerned at all that it's you
611,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"tonight? >> Well, I'm definitely"
612,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"concerned, but there's other Fang members that clearly were"
613,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,weak today. >> PROBST: Who's weaker than
614,00:37:54.38,00:37:54.38,you? >> Kenny was weaker than me
615,00:37:56.04,00:37:56.04,"today, and Crystal was weaker than me today."
616,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,>> That's just one challenge; I'm not weaker than her.
617,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,">> Exactly. But it's just, like... I'm just saying that,"
618,00:38:02.83,00:38:02.83,"like, I was moving in the situation and I was, like, going"
619,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,after it. >> I didn't just sit and watch.
620,00:38:07.42,00:38:07.42,"I tried to move that rowboat as fast as and as best as I could,"
621,00:38:10.75,00:38:10.75,but it wasn't moving. So I was in the game.
622,00:38:13.62,00:38:13.62,I just wasn't participating as much as I normally do.
623,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,That just wasn't my cup of tea today.
624,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,">> PROBST: It was really clear, the three people who"
625,00:38:21.33,00:38:21.33,"contributed. It was Jacquie, Ace, and Matty."
626,00:38:24.75,00:38:24.75,"Ace, if this group is truly trying to keep its tribe"
627,00:38:28.00,00:38:28.00,strong-- even though you're a former Kota member-- do you feel
628,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,safe? >> No. I'm scared.
629,00:38:33.29,00:38:33.29,"But, like, I mean, I don't think it would be the best strategic"
630,00:38:36.46,00:38:36.46,"move on their part to knock me out now, just 'cause I can help,"
631,00:38:39.67,00:38:39.67,"physically, mentally as possible."
632,00:38:42.00,00:38:42.00,">> PROBST: Jacquie, if the truth is, this tribe wants to keep"
633,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"this tribe strong, you are arguably one of the strongest"
634,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,"people, men or women. >> I know, but I'm so nervous."
635,00:38:51.96,00:38:51.96,I-I don't feel safe at all because all of us Kota members
636,00:38:55.25,00:38:55.25,"are in the minority. I mean, there's only three of"
637,00:38:57.25,00:38:57.25,"us, and I just feel like I could easily just get picked off."
638,00:39:00.88,00:39:00.88,">> PROBST: Kenny, if the four Fang vote together tonight, who"
639,00:39:03.79,00:39:03.79,should be most worried? >> I would say Kelly or Jacquie
640,00:39:09.08,00:39:09.08,would have to be worried tonight because we do need
641,00:39:11.83,00:39:11.83,physical players on this tribe to start winning challenges.
642,00:39:14.62,00:39:14.62,So either one of them. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
643,00:39:18.46,00:39:18.46,">> PROBST: All right, it's time to get to the vote."
644,00:39:20.96,00:39:20.96,"Matty, you're up. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
645,00:39:34.88,00:39:34.88,">> (whispers): Kel, you voted for me last time."
646,00:39:37.75,00:39:37.75,There's nothing like returning the favor.
647,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,>> (whispers): Sorry. >> It probably would have been
648,00:40:07.38,00:40:07.38,"smarter to keep you, but this is how it is."
649,00:40:15.38,00:40:15.38,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
650,00:40:18.42,00:40:18.42,\xe2\x99\xaa  \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: If anybody has a
651,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,"hidden immunity idol and you wanted to play it, now would be"
652,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read,"
653,00:40:34.25,00:40:34.25,the decision is final. Person voted out'll be asked to
654,00:40:36.33,00:40:36.33,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
655,00:40:38.25,00:40:38.25,I'll read the votes. First vote.
656,00:40:43.92,00:40:43.92,Jacquie. Kelly. One vote Jacquie;
657,00:40:50.04,00:40:50.04,one vote Kelly. Kelly. Two votes Kelly;
658,00:40:55.58,00:40:55.58,one vote Jacquie. Jacquie. We're tied.
659,00:41:01.79,00:41:01.79,Two votes Kelly; two votes Jacquie.
660,00:41:07.50,00:41:07.50,Jacquie. That's three votes Jacquie;
661,00:41:09.67,00:41:09.67,two votes Kelly. Fourth person voted out of
662,00:41:16.12,00:41:16.12,Survivor: Gabon: Jacquie.
663,00:41:18.25,00:41:18.25,That's four; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
664,00:41:21.33,00:41:21.33,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Jacquie, the tribe has spoken."
665,00:41:34.25,00:41:34.25,"Time for you to go. Well, one thing is for certain:"
666,00:41:47.79,00:41:47.79,Sugar will be returning from Exile Island and will become the
667,00:41:51.08,00:41:51.08,newest member of the Fang Tribe. Grab your torches.
668,00:41:54.12,00:41:54.12,Head back to camp. Good night.

682,00:42:54.21,00:42:54.21,saving their own butts. But I'll be waiting for when
