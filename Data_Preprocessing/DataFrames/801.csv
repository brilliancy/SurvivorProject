14,00:01:35.23,00:01:35.23,else is in the game. They don't even know there are
15,00:01:38.17,00:01:38.17,three tribes. When they arrive at their

49,00:05:15.73,00:05:15.73,eclectic group and it's gonna be really interesting to watch how
50,00:05:19.20,00:05:19.20,this shakes out. I can't wait to start wheeling
51,00:05:22.50,00:05:22.50,dealing and building shelters and winning challenges and vote
52,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,"people out. >> You know, it's hard for"

54,00:05:34.50,00:05:34.50,but I'm here for the new race. This ain't a little boy's game.
55,00:05:38.23,00:05:38.23,It's for the big boys. >> All-Star Survivor
56,00:05:43.03,00:05:43.03,is gonna be so cut-throat it's not even gonna be fun.
57,00:05:45.73,00:05:45.73,"Nobody trusts anybody. Nobody. Nobody trusts anybody, you"
58,00:05:51.23,00:05:51.23,"understand? >> Well, let's see."
59,00:05:54.20,00:05:54.20,">> Hey, we got a machete anyway. >> Yeah, we got a note."
60,00:05:56.90,00:05:56.90,">> All right, honey. >> You ready?"
61,00:05:58.87,00:05:58.87,>> Yes. >> It's a map.
62,00:06:00.60,00:06:00.60,">> It's a map, to the water and to the burnt log."
63,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,">> It's weird, because we know each other."
64,00:06:05.87,00:06:05.87,"You know who to be careful of, who not to be careful of, who"
65,00:06:09.23,00:06:09.23,"are friends, who are not friends."
66,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,"Like, everybody knows, if you push my buttons you may get me"
67,00:06:15.57,00:06:15.57,"to crack, an-and that could be my demise."
68,00:06:18.93,00:06:18.93,>> Is that way...? Which way is north?
69,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,">> Hey! I-I... Hey, I think this is it."
70,00:06:25.07,00:06:25.07,"We've either found the water or- or a big john, one."
71,00:06:29.10,00:06:29.10,">> Oh, no. >> Oh, no."
72,00:06:35.33,00:06:35.33,">> That looks like milk to me. We have well water, and it's"
73,00:06:38.90,00:06:38.90,highly contaminated. You're gonna get all these
74,00:06:41.43,00:06:41.43,diseases if you don't boil it. We have no fire.
75,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,"I mean, it's just like they dropped you off, all right, go."
76,00:06:48.27,00:06:48.27,Go ahead. There's a cooking pot and
77,00:06:50.53,00:06:50.53,machete... a water source. What you would do?
78,00:07:01.10,00:07:01.10,>> Our supplies here are extremely meager.
79,00:07:04.57,00:07:04.57,"As all-star survivors, we don't have anything to build a fire"
80,00:07:09.13,00:07:09.13,"with so, I think shelter is the primary concern."
81,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,">> What about this space right here, you guys?"
82,00:07:16.23,00:07:16.23,>> That's real solid. >> We go all the way across.
83,00:07:19.17,00:07:19.17,>> Right to there. >> The best way to do it...
84,00:07:21.83,00:07:21.83,>> We got a team. The first thing we want to do if
85,00:07:25.43,00:07:25.43,"we wanted to be a team... It wasn't five minutes, they"
86,00:07:28.27,00:07:28.27,was six ideas on how to do everything.
87,00:07:30.87,00:07:30.87,>> Are all six of us going to go to sleep at
88,00:07:33.20,00:07:33.20,the same time? >> Instead of going
89,00:07:34.77,00:07:34.77,"there, we're going this way. >> Yes."
90,00:07:37.00,00:07:37.00,>> Why don't we try to do it right from the beginning?
91,00:07:39.67,00:07:39.67,"You know? I'm not trying to be a bitch, but it's like-- do it"
92,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,"right, babe. I'm definitely vulnerable."
93,00:07:44.87,00:07:44.87,I'm the first one out... because I'm the most outspoken.
94,00:07:49.83,00:07:49.83,>> What do you think? >> Tom is weird.
95,00:07:53.13,00:07:53.13,What's he's worrying about the ... roof for?
96,00:07:54.97,00:07:54.97,"Okay. Um, I'm okay now. Let's grab that big one there..."
97,00:07:57.13,00:07:57.13,>> All right. >> ...and put it right
98,00:07:58.93,00:07:58.93,"here, Rob. >> We're putting it over here"
99,00:08:00.80,00:08:00.80,now? Now we're moving again?
100,00:08:02.77,00:08:02.77,"I didn't know I was gonna be again on the buffoon tribe, but"
101,00:08:07.83,00:08:07.83,"apparently I'm the brains behind this operation, so I'm gonna"
102,00:08:10.97,00:08:10.97,have to make it work somehow. >> Saboga.
103,00:08:21.70,00:08:21.70,>> Is that a machete? >> It is a machete.
104,00:08:23.63,00:08:23.63,>> Yay. >> A map.
105,00:08:25.53,00:08:25.53,>> We are here and the water is there.
106,00:08:27.53,00:08:27.53,">> First impression of the group, I'm happy with the group."
107,00:08:30.20,00:08:30.20,"You know, you got the mom, the nice guy, the military guy, the"
108,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,hot chick. We're all going to play this
109,00:08:35.43,00:08:35.43,"game, and we're all going to battle for this prize, and it's"
110,00:08:38.00,00:08:38.00,"just, it's amazing that all these different styles of play"
111,00:08:40.17,00:08:40.17,are going to come together. >> Rudy!
112,00:08:43.67,00:08:43.67,">> What do I look like, Magellan?"
113,00:08:45.93,00:08:45.93,( laughter ) >> I did this again
114,00:08:48.67,00:08:48.67,because it's part of my being. It's not about the money for me.
115,00:08:51.40,00:08:51.40,It's all about life experiences. And whenever I kick the bucket
116,00:08:56.37,00:08:56.37,"one day, I am going out with a casket full of life experiences."
117,00:09:01.70,00:09:01.70,>> Rupret? >> Rupert.
118,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,">> Sorry. Rupert. >> How are you getting there,"
119,00:09:07.07,00:09:07.07,"just cutting through here? I'm the new guy on the block,"
120,00:09:09.57,00:09:09.57,you know. All these people know each
121,00:09:11.70,00:09:11.70,other. >> Take a right.
122,00:09:13.63,00:09:13.63,>> Right now I'm just trying to stand back and let all
123,00:09:17.83,00:09:17.83,these egos decide what we do and I'll be the worker bee.
124,00:09:21.67,00:09:21.67,"New strategy for a new game. >> Rupert, look at this."
125,00:09:26.57,00:09:26.57,Holy cow! We're in banana heaven!
126,00:09:30.83,00:09:30.83,>> We're in paradise. >> We really are.
127,00:09:33.23,00:09:33.23,"Okay, we have so many bananas, but they're not quite ripe."
128,00:09:36.87,00:09:36.87,"When we got on the boat and I saw everybody, I was ecstatic."
129,00:09:40.70,00:09:40.70,Rupert and Jerri are in my league.
130,00:09:43.70,00:09:43.70,"Rudy, perfect ally. Tina and Ethan, two winners."
131,00:09:47.40,00:09:47.40,Done. It's so easy to convince the
132,00:09:50.30,00:09:50.30,others to vote off the two winners.
133,00:09:53.27,00:09:53.27,>> Banana tree was a dead- end trail.
134,00:09:55.27,00:09:55.27,We're following whatever trail was by the banana tree.
135,00:09:57.63,00:09:57.63,>> I feel very vulnerable. I did get put on a team
136,00:10:01.10,00:10:01.10,with a woman who doesn't like me.
137,00:10:03.53,00:10:03.53,"Tina is a huge concern of mine. She didn't like me in Australia,"
138,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,and I don't know necessarily if she likes me now.
139,00:10:10.47,00:10:10.47,But I'm going to try this new strategy of mine and that's just
140,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47,to keep my damn mouth shut. >> Lookit.
141,00:10:17.60,00:10:17.60,">> Yay. >> Oh, yay."
142,00:10:19.27,00:10:19.27,">> Yes, that's very good."
143,00:10:21.60,00:10:21.60,">> Oh, nice. >> We did find our water"
144,00:10:25.40,00:10:25.40,source but we can't drink it right out of the well.
145,00:10:28.23,00:10:28.23,There's potential brain parasites that will put you in a
146,00:10:31.03,00:10:31.03,"coma, so it's not something to be taken lightly."
147,00:10:33.57,00:10:33.57,>> Take a pot of water back with us.
148,00:10:35.87,00:10:35.87,">> No, no, no, no. We have to boil it, Rudy."
149,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,"Five minutes, we have to boil it."
150,00:10:40.37,00:10:40.37,">> We'll boil it, we'll boil it. >> You know, I drank bad"
151,00:10:43.13,00:10:43.13,"water all over the world, in Vietnam and Russia, and it never"
152,00:10:46.93,00:10:46.93,bothered me. I drank dirtier stuff than that.
153,00:11:00.30,00:11:00.30,>> I like this spot. >> I like this spot for shelter.
154,00:11:02.83,00:11:02.83,>> This is my vote. >> What do you think
155,00:11:05.00,00:11:05.00,"about this, Kathy, for a house? Give you all reasons."
156,00:11:07.07,00:11:07.07,"There's a little breeze, but we'll put the fire closer to the"
157,00:11:09.27,00:11:09.27,water where there's even more breeze 'cause that's where we'll
158,00:11:11.33,00:11:11.33,"mostly be hanging out, I think. >> I don't see why not."
159,00:11:13.50,00:11:13.50,As long as there's a breeze to keep the bugs away.
160,00:11:15.53,00:11:15.53,">> We've got to have a fire, and we've got to have a"
161,00:11:17.70,00:11:17.70,shelter. We know where the water is.
162,00:11:19.93,00:11:19.93,">> You guys get bamboo... >> We're going to bring,"
163,00:11:21.87,00:11:21.87,"yeah, building materials as far as bamboo."
164,00:11:23.87,00:11:23.87,"I think I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a day that went by,"
165,00:11:26.83,00:11:26.83,"since being in Africa, that I didn't think at some point, even"
166,00:11:29.63,00:11:29.63,"if it was just for a moment, about Survivor and about the"
167,00:11:32.47,00:11:32.47,game and about the possibility of coming back one day.
168,00:11:35.13,00:11:35.13,">> We can use that tree and the ""Y"" there and lay one"
169,00:11:37.83,00:11:37.83,beam in there and that will be the high side.
170,00:11:39.87,00:11:39.87,It'll angle this way. We don't need it any higher than
171,00:11:42.30,00:11:42.30,that. It's never been done before.
172,00:11:44.30,00:11:44.30,No one's ever gone back to play this game twice.
173,00:11:47.30,00:11:47.30,"It changes the game completely, not from a physical standpoint"
174,00:11:50.93,00:11:50.93,but psychologically we know how bad gets and we know how long
175,00:11:54.53,00:11:54.53,this road is. It'll be interesting to see
176,00:11:56.33,00:11:56.33,who's up for that. Are you guys all cool with this
177,00:11:58.87,00:11:58.87,"thing? >> No, that's fine, yeah."
178,00:12:01.63,00:12:01.63,>> I just can't believe we're here.
179,00:12:03.93,00:12:03.93,"Like, we're such morons. You left everything you love to"
180,00:12:07.77,00:12:07.77,"come starve and have no water, have no fire."
181,00:12:11.03,00:12:11.03,"Seriously, we've got issues. >> I know they're making"
182,00:12:15.27,00:12:15.27,alliances. >> I told you it was
183,00:12:17.17,00:12:17.17,going to be them against us. >> It's the guys and the
184,00:12:19.47,00:12:19.47,"girls, totally. I totally know it."
185,00:12:21.03,00:12:21.03,>> Hey. >> Yeah?
186,00:12:22.90,00:12:22.90,">> Those girls are plotting, honey."
187,00:12:25.07,00:12:25.07,Hope you aren't plotting with them.
188,00:12:27.33,00:12:27.33,">> No, we didn't get into anything, honestly."

190,00:12:33.27,00:12:33.27,"good state to have them in. Suppose I ought to be as well,"
191,00:12:36.97,00:12:36.97,but... >> The guys have got some
192,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77,scheme. You can feel it.
193,00:12:42.10,00:12:42.10,">> I think Colby and Lex are, like... Richard..."
194,00:12:45.03,00:12:45.03,>> I think they are. I think they are. I really do.
195,00:12:47.93,00:12:47.93,"There is a girl thing that got manifested, and so we were"
196,00:12:50.40,00:12:50.40,talking about it. And did we even think of doing a
197,00:12:53.07,00:12:53.07,360 to look around if anybody was listening?
198,00:12:56.33,00:12:56.33,>> Let's talk about that since I was sitting in the
199,00:13:00.17,00:13:00.17,woods listening to the girl power.
200,00:13:02.43,00:13:02.43,( laughs ) >> There is too much girl power.
201,00:13:05.03,00:13:05.03,"So our alliance wasn't too good. So with that, we just aired out"
202,00:13:10.47,00:13:10.47,"all our dirty laundry. >> Boys, I told them"
203,00:13:13.73,00:13:13.73,what I heard about the girl power and they think we got boy
204,00:13:16.37,00:13:16.37,power going. >> You know what?
205,00:13:18.80,00:13:18.80,Let's just call a time-out... >> I agree.
206,00:13:21.27,00:13:21.27,>> We have so much time to do that later.
207,00:13:23.40,00:13:23.40,Let's just have a good time now. Let's win challenges when we
208,00:13:25.83,00:13:25.83,have to win challenges and let's get a comfortable shelter going.
209,00:13:30.37,00:13:30.37,>> I don't trust any of you sons of guns.
210,00:13:33.20,00:13:33.20,>> I don't trust any of you! >> I don't care whether
211,00:13:35.70,00:13:35.70,"you're a man, or woman. I don't trust you."
212,00:13:38.10,00:13:38.10,>> Let's just win and then we won't talk about
213,00:13:41.47,00:13:41.47,this for another... >> We can definitely put
214,00:13:44.10,00:13:44.10,"this on the back burner for a while, can't we?"
215,00:13:46.70,00:13:46.70,>> Survivor: All-Stars is a different game and I'm
216,00:13:49.03,00:13:49.03,figuring out how to play it. So I've really got to push and
217,00:13:51.87,00:13:51.87,"probe and stir the pot a little. I'm just a big-ass target,"
218,00:13:55.43,00:13:55.43,Doesn't matter what I do. Just going to keep shaking
219,00:13:57.70,00:13:57.70,"things up a little bit. >> Richard, do you"
220,00:14:00.63,00:14:00.63,know where we can find a rock that might start the fire with a
221,00:14:04.27,00:14:04.27,knife? >> A rock against
222,00:14:05.70,00:14:05.70,"steel, you think? >> Oh, are you naked?"
223,00:14:07.67,00:14:07.67,>> Wouldn't that be shocking? >> It would be shocking.
224,00:14:10.70,00:14:10.70,"Yeah, he's naked. Okay. >> All right, we'll be back."
225,00:14:14.27,00:14:14.27,>> That's enough. This is off to an interesting
226,00:14:17.70,00:14:17.70,start. >> There it goes.
227,00:14:32.37,00:14:32.37,>> This it is. >> Keep going.
228,00:14:35.27,00:14:35.27,This is it. >> Come on!
229,00:14:38.67,00:14:38.67,Come on! ( grunting )
230,00:14:45.07,00:14:45.07,>> All right. >> We have to be able to
231,00:14:51.03,00:14:51.03,boil the water. The first tribe in this game
232,00:14:53.97,00:14:53.97,that gets water and fire is a tribe that's going to go the
233,00:14:58.00,00:14:58.00,farthest. >> This is burning hot.
234,00:15:00.57,00:15:00.57,Burning. >> I've so been where
235,00:15:03.77,00:15:03.77,you're at right now. I did it for two days in Borneo.
236,00:15:07.60,00:15:07.60,"I can't do fire. I have tried. >> All right, there's"
237,00:15:10.60,00:15:10.60,that positive attitude we're looking for.
238,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27,>> I killed myself probably three hours each day to
239,00:15:14.53,00:15:14.53,try to start a fire. You guys have just started.
240,00:15:17.27,00:15:17.27,">> So far, Sue has yet to help us on the fire."
241,00:15:19.77,00:15:19.77,"She says, ""I can't do it."" Wherever..."
242,00:15:21.97,00:15:21.97,"Borneo, where the hell they went last time."
243,00:15:24.00,00:15:24.00,"Well, this ain't last time. This is this time."
244,00:15:34.07,00:15:34.07,>> I am not going to let myself even get close to
245,00:15:36.50,00:15:36.50,"dehydration because it's hard to bring yourself back from it,"
246,00:15:39.23,00:15:39.23,especially in this kind of situation.
247,00:15:41.17,00:15:41.17,Got to drink it. I lived in Canada for six years
248,00:15:44.37,00:15:44.37,and I drank the water right out of the lakes.
249,00:15:46.70,00:15:46.70,"Right out of the lakes. No filter system, nothing."
250,00:15:52.47,00:15:52.47,"The way I see it, I drank enough beaver poop in my life that my"
251,00:15:56.70,00:15:56.70,"body can handle what might be growing in there, eh?"
252,00:16:00.33,00:16:00.33,>> You drank the water from the well?
253,00:16:03.33,00:16:03.33,>> Yeah. >> Without boiling it?
254,00:16:05.30,00:16:05.30,">> Rob, I've probably dranken worse water."
255,00:16:08.70,00:16:08.70,>> How much of it did you drink? >> I drank four big coconut...
256,00:16:11.97,00:16:11.97,I left the coconut shell up there.
257,00:16:14.80,00:16:14.80,"It's, like, three-quarters of a coconut shell."
258,00:16:16.97,00:16:16.97,">> Can anybody say ""dumb ass""? >> I drank four of 'em."
259,00:16:19.10,00:16:19.10,"I actually got too full. I wanted to drink more, but I'm"
260,00:16:22.77,00:16:22.77,"too full. >> That's a lot, Sue."
261,00:16:26.00,00:16:26.00,">> Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
262,00:16:28.80,00:16:28.80,I don't know what Sue is up to. If you get sick and you have to
263,00:16:34.33,00:16:34.33,"check out of this game, you're leaving five other people"
264,00:16:36.93,00:16:36.93,here to do the job of six. >> If she's going to drink
265,00:16:40.13,00:16:40.13,"it, she's going to drink it. >> If it's going to kill"
266,00:16:42.53,00:16:42.53,"her, I don't want to leave her half dead because it will be a"
267,00:16:45.63,00:16:45.63,... mess. >> It would stink.
268,00:16:47.50,00:16:47.50,And we'll have to clean it. >> It'll be like a corpse.
269,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50,">> Got smoke, got smoke, got smoke."
270,00:17:04.13,00:17:04.13,Some smoke. >> Come on.
271,00:17:10.23,00:17:10.23,>> I can't. I can't.
272,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,We're all dying of thirst. We need fire.
273,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,My head's ready to pop. We need to be able to boil
274,00:17:20.43,00:17:20.43,water. We could be like Rudy and just
275,00:17:24.00,00:17:24.00,"grab the water and drink it, but none of us want to die."
276,00:17:31.20,00:17:31.20,>> It's burning my fingers. >> We're so close.
277,00:17:33.13,00:17:33.13,( Ethan grunting ) >> We tried with the
278,00:17:39.43,00:17:39.43,fire plow forever. Nothing happened.
279,00:17:41.20,00:17:41.20,"We got a curl of smoke and we were like cavemen, but that's"
280,00:17:44.37,00:17:44.37,"not fire. >> Once you work this bow,"
281,00:17:48.07,00:17:48.07,it causes friction. A lot more friction than that
282,00:17:51.47,00:17:51.47,"way, you know? I mean, if you want to do it the"
283,00:17:54.47,00:17:54.47,"right way, this is the way. >> Well, so that didn't work."
284,00:18:01.40,00:18:01.40,">> Nope. >> I mean, unless God"
285,00:18:03.97,00:18:03.97,"strikes a log around here with lightning, we might never get"
286,00:18:06.43,00:18:06.43,fire. >> We definitely need
287,00:18:08.30,00:18:08.30,something right now to give us some hope.
288,00:18:10.57,00:18:10.57,I think everybody's starting to feel a little...
289,00:18:12.47,00:18:12.47,>> Feel worried. Not a little. Feel worried.
290,00:18:15.43,00:18:15.43,">> I'm glad I'm not alone. >> No, you're not alone."
291,00:18:18.73,00:18:18.73,I'm worried as hell. >> We've been given
292,00:18:21.83,00:18:21.83,"nothing, and the realization of it has now hit home."
293,00:18:25.43,00:18:25.43,No one's going to come in and save us.
294,00:18:27.70,00:18:27.70,We have to save ourselves. ( Rupert sighs )
295,00:18:34.17,00:18:34.17,>> You know what I think? Me and you ought to think about
296,00:18:37.47,00:18:37.47,"an alliance. >> You're a man of your word,"
297,00:18:42.07,00:18:42.07,"too from what a know of you. I am, too."
298,00:18:45.27,00:18:45.27,"Rudy looks at me and the first time he sees me, you know, all"
299,00:18:50.27,00:18:50.27,"tie-dyed and hippie, he looked right through it and wanted to"
300,00:18:53.83,00:18:53.83,be my buddy. >> Tina and Ethan are good
301,00:18:56.60,00:18:56.60,buddies. >> I know.
302,00:18:58.30,00:18:58.30,>> The other two are good buddies.
303,00:19:00.40,00:19:00.40,>> I know. >> We could be out of this
304,00:19:03.23,00:19:03.23,thing in a hurry. >> Yup.
305,00:19:06.47,00:19:06.47,>> I figured me and Rupert ought to protect ourselves and
306,00:19:11.00,00:19:11.00,"form an alliance, and that's all we did."
307,00:19:13.03,00:19:13.03,"He says, ""I can depend on you,"" and he says, ""You can depend on"
308,00:19:16.03,00:19:16.03,"me."" That's all I got to hear."
309,00:19:22.40,00:19:22.40,>> You and I are going to be strong to the end.
310,00:19:25.13,00:19:25.13,>> Yeah. >> Rudy is a man of few
311,00:19:27.60,00:19:27.60,"words, but from what I gathered, he's a man of honor."
312,00:19:30.00,00:19:30.00,"If he and I stick together, if we can just make it through"
313,00:19:32.87,00:19:32.87,"these first few days, he and I will stick together through the"
314,00:19:35.87,00:19:35.87,end of the game. >> I'm dying.
315,00:19:55.00,00:19:55.00,I didn't sleep at all last night.
316,00:19:57.30,00:19:57.30,"Every two seconds, rolling over, getting bit, I don't think I can"
317,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,do another night like that. >> No.
318,00:20:03.07,00:20:03.07,>> I am beat right now. >> You know what?
319,00:20:05.00,00:20:05.00,I don't want to do another night like that.
320,00:20:06.97,00:20:06.97,>> Last night was by far the worst night I've ever spent
321,00:20:09.57,00:20:09.57,in a Survivor. I would have built a shelter
322,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,completely differently. I'm in construction.
323,00:20:15.57,00:20:15.57,"I know what I'm doing. >> Once we get fire, we"
324,00:20:17.97,00:20:17.97,can make everything else happen. That's the thing.
325,00:20:20.10,00:20:20.10,">> That's the thing. >> We got our shelter, good."
326,00:20:22.57,00:20:22.57,I don't even want to think about that shelter until we have fire.
327,00:20:25.27,00:20:25.27,I don't even care about it. I'll sleep on the beach if I
328,00:20:27.90,00:20:27.90,"have to, but we need to have fire to get some water at this"
329,00:20:31.07,00:20:31.07,point. >> I'm more than willing
330,00:20:33.13,00:20:33.13,"to work on the fire issue, but all aspects of our shelter"
331,00:20:35.73,00:20:35.73,should have been created differently.
332,00:20:38.07,00:20:38.07,These flat pieces are no good. >> It's my back and my
333,00:20:41.83,00:20:41.83,shoulders and arms touching the wood.
334,00:20:44.17,00:20:44.17,>> And the sand. >> Yeah.
335,00:20:46.10,00:20:46.10,>> There are six people here without water.
336,00:20:48.43,00:20:48.43,Two people are more concerned about the bottom of the shelter
337,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,because they're not comfortable at night sleeping.
338,00:20:54.13,00:20:54.13,There's not one person here that doesn't understand that you two
339,00:20:56.50,00:20:56.50,have not been able to sleep. Six people haven't had water.
340,00:20:59.57,00:20:59.57,That's what I'm thinking. >> We've been busting
341,00:21:01.90,00:21:01.90,"our ass trying to make fire since we got here, since day"
342,00:21:04.33,00:21:04.33,"one. >> You keep giving up on it,"
343,00:21:06.47,00:21:06.47,though. >> Every single day.
344,00:21:08.27,00:21:08.27,We haven't been giving up. We're physically exhausted.
345,00:21:10.57,00:21:10.57,We're dehydrated. >> Don't yell.
346,00:21:12.30,00:21:12.30,">> I'm not yelling, I'm just saying call it like it is."
347,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,>> I am calling it like it is. We just talked about it.
348,00:21:16.37,00:21:16.37,We all are calling it like it is.
349,00:21:18.53,00:21:18.53,>> I'm not going through another night over here with no
350,00:21:20.83,00:21:20.83,"sleep, that's all. >> I was sleeping in the"
351,00:21:23.57,00:21:23.57,"same thing you guys were. >> We didn't sleep, though."
352,00:21:26.83,00:21:26.83,">> I never heard so much cry baby, titty sucking in all"
353,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,"my life. We bitched about the clothes,"
354,00:21:31.93,00:21:31.93,"we bitched about the weather, and we bitched that God ain't"
355,00:21:34.90,00:21:34.90,give us no water. We're going to have to toughen
356,00:21:37.67,00:21:37.67,up a little bit. >> Are you two happy with this?
357,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,>> Yeah because we don't want to do it again.
358,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,">> Thank you. That's all I care about, really."
359,00:21:44.40,00:21:44.40,'Cause I have been able to sleep.
360,00:21:46.13,00:21:46.13,I want you guys to be able to sleep.
361,00:21:48.63,00:21:48.63,>> What can I say about Alicia? She's a drama queen.
362,00:21:51.03,00:21:51.03,"You want the fact, you come to Mariano, you get it as it is."
363,00:21:56.13,00:21:56.13,She's a drama queen. >> Let's start this
364,00:21:59.23,00:21:59.23,freaking fire. Somebody has to say something.
365,00:22:02.03,00:22:02.03,They can't just do that. Who made Rob the master of this
366,00:22:04.80,00:22:04.80,camp and Amber his little in-pocket girl?
367,00:22:06.63,00:22:06.63,When did that happen? >> What do you think?
368,00:22:08.40,00:22:08.40,You want to make an alliance and cover our own asses?
369,00:22:11.10,00:22:11.10,>> I don't know if I can take you seriously or not.
370,00:22:13.57,00:22:13.57,>> I'm being 100% serious. Just we can't make it obvious at
371,00:22:16.23,00:22:16.23,"all. Like, I'm carrying logs with you"
372,00:22:18.57,00:22:18.57,right now. It's got to end.
373,00:22:20.97,00:22:20.97,>> Right. >> All right?
374,00:22:22.87,00:22:22.87,>> All right. >> Do you want to?
375,00:22:25.07,00:22:25.07,>> Yeah. >> Amber and I have an
376,00:22:28.27,00:22:28.27,"alliance for obvious reasons. She's beautiful, obviously, any"
377,00:22:33.60,00:22:33.60,idiot can see that. But I'll keep my word no matter
378,00:22:37.50,00:22:37.50,what to her. I trust her.
379,00:22:38.80,00:22:38.80,I don't think she's going to screw me.
380,00:22:57.50,00:22:57.50,>> Switch up. That thing is so hot.
381,00:23:05.63,00:23:05.63,Do you want me to take over? >> Yeah.
382,00:23:13.57,00:23:13.57,">> Yeah, all-stars. Boy, that's the kicker."
383,00:23:16.43,00:23:16.43,"I think within the last 24 hours we've all questioned, at"
384,00:23:20.50,00:23:20.50,"least half a dozen times, why in the world we signed up for this."
385,00:23:27.10,00:23:27.10,>> Maybe there's something in there.

387,00:23:37.77,00:23:37.77,could start the fire without even blinking.
388,00:23:39.43,00:23:39.43,But they don't need to know that.
389,00:23:41.67,00:23:41.67,( laughs ) But I have no interest in
390,00:23:46.17,00:23:46.17,trying. Look at how skinny they all are.
391,00:23:49.07,00:23:49.07,They'll be dying in no time. I'm fine.
392,00:23:52.87,00:23:52.87,I'm not even hungry. I'm playing that one by ear.
393,00:23:56.73,00:23:56.73,They could think I'm just cocky and arrogant and think I could
394,00:23:59.57,00:23:59.57,"last the whole game. Hmm, imagine that."
395,00:24:04.03,00:24:04.03,>> Sorry I'm not very helpful. >> No worries.

399,00:24:17.90,00:24:17.90,>> Richard is totally obnoxious. He's going out of his way to not
400,00:24:20.67,00:24:20.67,do any work. I think Richard wants to stand
401,00:24:22.97,00:24:22.97,out. I think Richard wants to be
402,00:24:25.57,00:24:25.57,special in our group. It's just part of his strategy
403,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"to kind of be like a little bit shocking, like ""I don't really"
404,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,"care what happens..."" >> Man, when we... when we"
405,00:24:35.30,00:24:35.30,"get to the players splitting this... splitting these things,"

408,00:24:41.90,00:24:41.90,( pounding continues ) Richard Hatch was the very first
409,00:24:44.90,00:24:44.90,"person to win Survivor, ever. He spent the last couple, three"
410,00:24:48.73,00:24:48.73,years since he won Survivor talking about how he is just the
411,00:24:52.47,00:24:52.47,best this game has ever seen. >> I love the fact
412,00:24:55.40,00:24:55.40,"that he's just, you know... >> Lounging, lounging."
413,00:24:57.50,00:24:57.50,>> Lounging in his birthday suit.
414,00:24:59.40,00:24:59.40,He is the king! >> He was the king when he
415,00:25:01.40,00:25:01.40,was playing with a bunch of sheep.
416,00:25:03.23,00:25:03.23,>> Mm-hmm. >> That's true.
417,00:25:05.23,00:25:05.23,That's true. >> That was like shooting
418,00:25:07.23,00:25:07.23,fish in a barrel. ( laughs )
419,00:25:09.00,00:25:09.00,This is a whole 'nother thing altogether.
420,00:25:10.80,00:25:10.80,">> He's the prototype for all of us other survivors,"
421,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,so of course everyone wants him down.
422,00:25:16.43,00:25:16.43,Everyone wants to dethrone the king.
423,00:25:18.27,00:25:18.27,"I mean, are you doing this, like, alone thing on purpose?"
424,00:25:20.40,00:25:20.40,'Cause it... >> Kind of.
425,00:25:22.37,00:25:22.37,"Um, I'm off by myself so people can see I'm not..."
426,00:25:24.43,00:25:24.43,"Yeah, you guys can be all talking together."
427,00:25:26.23,00:25:26.23,Four of you went off into the woods while I was out floating.
428,00:25:28.77,00:25:28.77,">> Yeah, but we weren't talking about anything."
429,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,">> Maybe, but you know what I mean?"
430,00:25:33.63,00:25:33.63,I can't know that. >> Sure.
431,00:25:35.73,00:25:35.73,">> And have at it, you know? >> I personally"
432,00:25:38.97,00:25:38.97,think... what fun would it be if the king left the first day?
433,00:25:42.20,00:25:42.20,"It wouldn't be any fun. >> Ah, tree mail."
434,00:25:57.33,00:25:57.33,"We just got our first tree mail today, a little earlier than"
435,00:26:00.50,00:26:00.50,expected. But I guess today is just as
436,00:26:02.33,00:26:02.33,"good as any day, being that we'll probably just be thirstier"
437,00:26:05.17,00:26:05.17,"tomorrow. Well, I've got some good news"
438,00:26:09.77,00:26:09.77,and some bad news. >> Uh-oh.

601,00:36:40.77,00:36:40.77,( whooping ) We're the biggest bunch of

603,00:36:46.97,00:36:46.97,we go out there and win it. Nobody's expecting us to get it
604,00:36:50.57,00:36:50.57,done. We are the ultimate underdogs.
605,00:36:52.80,00:36:52.80,>> Wasn't that the coolest? >> That was the best.
606,00:36:55.60,00:36:55.60,>> We didn't win. We came in first place of the

613,00:37:36.07,00:37:36.07,one voted off. Tonight I think it's important
614,00:37:40.70,00:37:40.70,we take out the two winners first.
615,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,I don't want to see them get another million dollars.
616,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,I just want to get rid of them at the beginning.
617,00:37:48.30,00:37:48.30,">> And I hate to say it, but... it's going to feel good."
618,00:37:51.13,00:37:51.13,">> It's gonna feel great. >> ...good, because"

622,00:38:02.97,00:38:02.97,him. He could be playing a bigger
623,00:38:05.10,00:38:05.10,game than I think. Everything's a game.
624,00:38:07.37,00:38:07.37,You can't take anything anyone says for what it means.
625,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"You're a very strong member of the tribe, but you're also a"

627,00:38:15.10,00:38:15.10,that's your best advantage. >> No. It's not.
628,00:38:17.27,00:38:17.27,>> You got to be silly now to bring a winner to the
629,00:38:19.83,00:38:19.83,final two. >> I just don't want
630,00:38:22.70,00:38:22.70,"you and Tina around, 'cause you're winners."
631,00:38:24.73,00:38:24.73,>> You honestly think that? >> Yeah.
632,00:38:26.60,00:38:26.60,Nobody out here wants to reward another winner.
633,00:38:28.97,00:38:28.97,"Sorry, guys, it's our game now. Get the hell off our playing"

635,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,for Jenna tonight. We'd have a better chance
636,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,tonight to vote Jenny... Jenna. I think Ethan and I need to
637,00:38:44.53,00:38:44.53,"stick together, because if we are the first two targets, we"
638,00:38:48.90,00:38:48.90,"need to be trying to figure out for ourself, well, what can we"
639,00:38:51.80,00:38:51.80,do as targets to stay in the game.
640,00:38:54.97,00:38:54.97,"What to do, what to do. What's a mother to do?"
641,00:39:00.80,00:39:00.80,"Hopefully, we can pull Rupert in and kind of surprise everybody"
642,00:39:04.50,00:39:04.50,tonight. >> You got Jerri and
643,00:39:38.47,00:39:38.47,"Jenna on one side saying, ""We got to get rid of the winners."""
644,00:39:42.13,00:39:42.13,"I got Tina and Ethan on the other side saying, ""You cannot"
645,00:39:46.93,00:39:46.93,"trust Jerri and Jenna. You cannot trust them."""
646,00:39:49.23,00:39:49.23,I think I might have some control over Rudy's vote.

649,00:40:47.20,00:40:47.20,Tribal Council. It's a tree house suspended in
650,00:40:49.87,00:40:49.87,the middle of a jungle. A bit of a climb-- not one
651,00:40:52.63,00:40:52.63,you're gonna want to make often. Go ahead and grab a torch behind
652,00:40:55.80,00:40:55.80,you. Approach the flame. Get fire.
653,00:40:58.47,00:40:58.47,"Because I know you know by now, fire represents life on the"
654,00:41:03.17,00:41:03.17,island and definitely in this game.
655,00:41:10.30,00:41:10.30,"Once you have fire, put it back in its slot and have a seat."
656,00:41:23.30,00:41:23.30,"Well, it is the rainy season in Panama, so this could be a sign"
657,00:41:26.83,00:41:26.83,of things to come for the next 36 days.
658,00:41:29.67,00:41:29.67,How do the first three days out here compare to what you've been
659,00:41:33.40,00:41:33.40,"through in the past, Jerri? >> It's total hell."

664,00:41:50.80,00:41:50.80,"little piece of me that says, why in the hell did I come back"
665,00:41:54.27,00:41:54.27,here? I got to think about my wife and
666,00:41:58.00,00:41:58.00,my daughter. I did this for Laura and Reya.
667,00:42:01.20,00:42:01.20,Maybe I can do better this time. >> PROBST: I'm noticing that
668,00:42:06.03,00:42:06.03,Jerri is literally collecting water while we sit here and
669,00:42:08.90,00:42:08.90,"slurping it. >> It's bad, Jeff, it's bad."
670,00:42:11.70,00:42:11.70,"You can live without food, but you cannot live without water,"
671,00:42:14.20,00:42:14.20,"and we are all feeling it right now, and it's scary."
672,00:42:17.43,00:42:17.43,It's really scary. >> PROBST: Are you trying to
673,00:42:19.50,00:42:19.50,collect water in that? >> Yeah. It ends up
674,00:42:22.13,00:42:22.13,"being a spigot. >> PROBST: Rudy, how does this"
675,00:42:28.00,00:42:28.00,tribe stack up against Chapera and Mogo Mogo?

679,00:42:42.60,00:42:42.60,they're good. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
680,00:42:45.43,00:42:45.43,"liabilities. Rudy, you mentioned yours--"
681,00:42:47.63,00:42:47.63,you're 75-- although you're better than most 50-year-olds.
682,00:42:50.83,00:42:50.83,"Ethan, what's a drawback for you?"
683,00:42:53.23,00:42:53.23,What's gonna hurt you in this game?
684,00:42:56.40,00:42:56.40,">> I think, um, having won a game before may hurt me."
685,00:42:59.77,00:42:59.77,>> PROBST: Is one of the reasons that being a winner hurts you is
686,00:43:03.17,00:43:03.17,that people respect the fact that you've won this game and
687,00:43:06.27,00:43:06.27,"therefore are dangerous? >> Definitely, you know?"
688,00:43:09.77,00:43:09.77,"In addition to that, a lot of it's payback time, you know?"

697,00:43:31.30,00:43:31.30,>>  No. >> PROBST: Just based on
698,00:43:33.03,00:43:33.03,irritation. >> Just based on a
699,00:43:34.67,00:43:34.67,million dollars. It's a lot easier for the
700,00:43:36.77,00:43:36.77,"winners to come back and say they're here for competition,"
701,00:43:39.17,00:43:39.17,because they've got a bank account that has $1 million.
702,00:43:41.93,00:43:41.93,">> PROBST: Tina, is that fair? >> Of course not, but we"
703,00:43:45.77,00:43:45.77,all... all the winners who came back knew that coming in.
704,00:43:48.90,00:43:48.90,We all knew that we would have big targets on our chest.

707,00:43:59.30,00:43:59.30,think I would vote for the best person out there.
708,00:44:01.87,00:44:01.87,">> PROBST: How about for you, Rudy?"
709,00:44:03.87,00:44:03.87,">> If they can do it again, let them go."

713,00:44:12.33,00:44:12.33,the beginning of the season 'cause of the fact that they won
714,00:44:15.00,00:44:15.00,the championship that one year? No.
