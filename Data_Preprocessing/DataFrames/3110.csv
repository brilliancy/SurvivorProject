596,00:30:02.90,00:30:02.90,"HER SWEETNESS, YOU NEVER THINK WITH HER THAT SHE'S SO DEVIOUS,"
597,00:30:06.67,00:30:06.67,"BUT CIERA IS SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO MAKE BIG MOVES,"
598,00:30:09.80,00:30:09.80,ADVANCE HER CAUSE IN THE GAME.
599,00:30:11.17,00:30:11.17,"I THINK GETTING RID OF HER, I THINK I WOULD WORK WITH"
600,00:30:15.13,00:30:15.13,WENTWORTH.
601,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,I EVEN THINK ABI I WOULD WORK WITH.
602,00:30:18.27,00:30:18.27,I ALSO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
603,00:30:19.40,00:30:19.40,I WILL NEED THAT LATER IN THE GAME AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
604,00:30:21.87,00:30:21.87,IT TOO EARLY.
605,00:30:25.37,00:30:25.37,>> SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?
606,00:30:28.30,00:30:28.30,>> THE GUY WHO IS LIMPING AROUND WITH AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS POCKET.
607,00:30:34.07,00:30:34.07,>> PROMISE?
608,00:30:34.60,00:30:34.60,>> PROMISE.
609,00:30:37.10,00:30:37.10,"IT'S STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN."
610,00:30:40.13,00:30:40.13,>> POOPY PANTS?
611,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,>> WHAT.
612,00:30:42.03,00:30:42.03,>> POOPY PANTS.
613,00:30:42.93,00:30:42.93,>> STEPHEN.
614,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,>> I KNOW.
615,00:30:44.63,00:30:44.63,POOPY PANTS.
616,00:30:44.97,00:30:44.97,">> AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, I'M JUST HOPING THAT THE PLANS I"
617,00:30:48.27,00:30:48.27,SET IN MOTION TO BLINDSIDE STEVEN AND GET RID OF THAT
618,00:30:52.63,00:30:52.63,ADVANTAGE PLAY OUT.
619,00:30:53.10,00:30:53.10,AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SILLY NOT TO TAKE THE
620,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH STEPHEN OUT OF THE GAME AND FLUSH THAT
621,00:31:00.33,00:31:00.33,ADVANTAGE.
622,00:31:00.60,00:31:00.60,BUT IN CASE HE PLAYS AN ADVANTAGE ME AND WENTWORTH ARE
623,00:31:06.67,00:31:06.67,"GOING TO WRITE DOWN KIMMI, AND EVERYBODY ELSE WRITE DOWN"
624,00:31:11.63,00:31:11.63,FISHBACH.
625,00:31:11.90,00:31:11.90,">> HEY, I WANTED TO SEE WHERE YOU WERE."
626,00:31:13.53,00:31:13.53,"LIKE, IF WE GO WITH THE GIRLS, LIKE, IT'S THE CIERA SHOW, AND"
627,00:31:16.93,00:31:16.93,EVERY MOVE THAT SHE'S HERE THAT'S MADE IS ON HER RESUME.
628,00:31:21.50,00:31:21.50,"LIKE, ALL SHE DID WAS THROW OUT SPENCER-- THROW OUT STEPHEN'S"
629,00:31:24.90,00:31:24.90,"NAME YESTERDAY, DISPFS LIKE, BOOM, DONE."
630,00:31:26.83,00:31:26.83,LIKE THE GODFATHER.
631,00:31:27.87,00:31:27.87,THIS ONE'S NEXT.
632,00:31:30.13,00:31:30.13,THE THING THAT CIERA HAS DONE SO SUCCESSFULLY IS SHE'S BASICALLY
633,00:31:35.80,00:31:35.80,UNHINGED SEVERAL GROUPS.
634,00:31:36.50,00:31:36.50,AND MY QUESTION IS WHY ISN'T ANYONE TAKING CIERA OUT TO FREE
635,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,UP HER PEOPLE WHICH WOULD BE WENTWORTH AND ABI?
636,00:31:44.97,00:31:44.97,"IF WE UNHINGE CIERA'S CREW, THEY'RE UP FOR GRABS."
637,00:31:48.60,00:31:48.60,">> YEAH, TOTALLY."
638,00:31:52.57,00:31:52.57,"CIERA STILL SITS THERE AS AN EASY VOTE, BUT FOR ME, I FEEL"
639,00:31:55.53,00:31:55.53,LIKE IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST TO GET STEPHEN GONE AS QUICKLY AS
640,00:31:59.13,00:31:59.13,POSSIBLE.
641,00:31:59.40,00:31:59.40,NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF CONVINCING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAKE
642,00:32:01.90,00:32:01.90,THE RIGHT MOVE.
643,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,"I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THE GIRLS SAY, BUT THEY WANT ME,"
644,00:32:08.80,00:32:08.80,"TASH, HIM, AND KEITH TO VOTE STEPHEN."
645,00:32:12.30,00:32:12.30,">> OH, WE'RE DOING STEPHEN?"
646,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,>> THAT'S WHAT THE GIRLS JUST MADE US COMMIT TO STEPHEN.
647,00:32:18.20,00:32:18.20,>> YES.
648,00:32:18.60,00:32:18.60,>> OUR FIRST THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CIERA.
649,00:32:21.37,00:32:21.37,">> WHATEVER WE DECIDE WE HAVE TO DO, WE'RE TOGETHER NOW."
650,00:32:24.40,00:32:24.40,THIS IS IT.
651,00:32:24.83,00:32:24.83,">> OH, YEAH."
652,00:32:25.50,00:32:25.50,>> THERE'S NO OTHER-- >> ARE WE SURE THAT'S WHAT THE
653,00:32:28.53,00:32:28.53,GIRLS ARE DOING.
654,00:32:29.17,00:32:29.17,>> RIGHT.
655,00:32:30.37,00:32:30.37,>> THEY'VE REITERATED THAT SEVERAL TIMES.
656,00:32:31.90,00:32:31.90,>> IT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
657,00:32:35.23,00:32:35.23,>> I FEEL LIKE CIERA IS THE BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT NOW.
658,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,">> NO, SHE IS."
659,00:32:39.50,00:32:39.50,">> THE ADVANTAGE DOES SCARE ME, THOUGH."
660,00:32:42.13,00:32:42.13,MY HEAD IS IN TWO PLACES.
661,00:32:43.43,00:32:43.43,"I REALLY WANT CIERA GONE TONIGHT, AND I REALLY WANT"
662,00:32:46.43,00:32:46.43,STEPHEN GONE TONIGHT.
663,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,"I THINK CIERA, I KNOW SHE'S A LIAR."
664,00:32:49.83,00:32:49.83,"I KNOW SHE'S PLAYING EVERYBODY, WHILE I THINK STEVE SEN JUST A"
665,00:32:53.60,00:32:53.60,BIGGER THREAT IN THE FACT THAT HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME
666,00:32:56.53,00:32:56.53,WHICH NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
667,00:32:57.67,00:32:57.67,>> WHY DON'T WE ALL VOTE FOR STEPHEN?
668,00:32:59.73,00:32:59.73,>> WE ALL VOTE STEPHEN.
669,00:33:01.13,00:33:01.13,>> HE'S NOT PULLING ANYTHING OUT.
670,00:33:03.10,00:33:03.10,"AS LONG AS IT'S A BLINDSIDE, WE ALL VOTE STEPHEN."
671,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,>> IT'S A BAD MOVE.
672,00:33:08.50,00:33:08.50,SOME PEOPLE SAYING MAYBE THEY WANT TO VOTE STEPHEN OUT BECAUSE
673,00:33:10.83,00:33:10.83,OF HIS ADVANTAGE.
674,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GREAT IDEA RIGHT NOW.
675,00:33:14.17,00:33:14.17,I HAVE TWO IDOLS.
676,00:33:16.20,00:33:16.20,BUT I NEED STEPHEN.
677,00:33:17.77,00:33:17.77,STEPHEN AT LEAST HAS MY BACK.
678,00:33:19.47,00:33:19.47,I WANT STEVE TONE STAY.
679,00:33:21.20,00:33:21.20,STEPHEN TRUSTS ME.
680,00:33:22.37,00:33:22.37,CIERA HAS NO LOYALTY TO ANYBODY.
681,00:33:23.73,00:33:23.73,SHE'S A FREE AGENT.
682,00:33:25.63,00:33:25.63,SHE'LL FLOAT ANYWHERE JUST TO KEEP GOING.
683,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,>> OKAY.
684,00:33:27.60,00:33:27.60,>> STEPHEN WILL STAY WITH US.
685,00:33:28.60,00:33:28.60,">> IF STEPHEN HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE A MOVE, HE WILL."
686,00:33:31.07,00:33:31.07,AND THAT ADVANTAGE MIGHT GIVE HIM THE ABILITY TO MAKE A MOVE.
687,00:33:35.57,00:33:35.57,SO JEREMY IS ADAMANT.
688,00:33:38.40,00:33:38.40,IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.
689,00:33:39.23,00:33:39.23,IT'S A MISTAKE TO GET RID OF STEPHEN.
690,00:33:42.07,00:33:42.07,I WILL NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH STEVE NEN THIS GAME.
691,00:33:44.47,00:33:44.47,STEPHEN WHO HAS AN ADVANTAGE.
692,00:33:45.53,00:33:45.53,STEPHEN WHO IS CLOSER WITH KIMMI THAN ANY TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE
693,00:33:48.60,00:33:48.60,"GAME, WHO COULD EASILY FLIP ON US, MOREACY EASLEY THAN CIERA."
694,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,>> YOU'RE GIVING HER SO MUCH TRACTION.
695,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,"WE'VE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP, THOUGH."
696,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,">> THIS IS A REALLY CLOSE DECISION, MAYBE THE MOST"
697,00:34:06.10,00:34:06.10,IMPORTANT DECISION OF THE GAME.
698,00:34:06.97,00:34:06.97,BUT WHEN BOTH OF US ARE 100% CONVINCED THAT THE OTHER IS
699,00:34:12.30,00:34:12.30,"WRONG, ME THAT STEPHEN MUST GO, AND JEREMY THAT CIERA MUST GO,"
700,00:34:16.43,00:34:16.43,SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE.
701,00:34:17.57,00:34:17.57,SOMETHING HAS TO BREAK.
702,00:34:19.27,00:34:19.27,I HOPE STEPHEN'S GOING HOME.
703,00:34:20.93,00:34:20.93,BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
704,00:34:46.10,00:34:46.10,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
705,00:34:51.07,00:34:51.07,"KASS, SAVAGE, AND WIGLESWORTH, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL"
706,00:34:56.30,00:34:56.30,COUNCIL.
707,00:34:59.97,00:34:59.97,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER.
708,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,IT HAS BEEN ALMOST NONSTOP RAIN FOR THE PAST SELF DAYS.
709,00:35:07.43,00:35:07.43,"WENTWORTH, AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE, YOU WERE CROUCHED IN"
710,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,THE WATER ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE READY TO JUST GO AHEAD AND SINK
711,00:35:13.20,00:35:13.20,UNDER AND DROWN YOURSELF.
712,00:35:14.07,00:35:14.07,>> IT WAS WARMER TO BE SITTING IN THE WATER THAN TO BE STANDING
713,00:35:17.30,00:35:17.30,UP WITH THE RAIN COMING DOWN ON MY COLD BODY.
714,00:35:21.03,00:35:21.03,"THAT WAS HONESTLY THE FIRST TIME I'VE, LIKE, CRIED IN THIS GAME."
715,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,>> Jeff: WOW.
716,00:35:25.13,00:35:25.13,>> THIS IS LITERALLY THE LOWEST I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.
717,00:35:28.57,00:35:28.57,">> Jeff: FISHBACH, WHAT WAS YOUR LOWEST POINT?"
718,00:35:30.87,00:35:30.87,>> MY LOWEST POINT WAS HAVING SEVERE GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS
719,00:35:34.83,00:35:34.83,AT THE VERY PEAK OF THE STORM.
720,00:35:36.43,00:35:36.43,"I FELT JUST COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED, YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS"
721,00:35:39.63,00:35:39.63,FEELING THEY COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BUT I KNEW I HAD TO.
722,00:35:42.20,00:35:42.20,>> Jeff: SO THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY.
723,00:35:44.90,00:35:44.90,I OFFERED YOU A SHOT TO CHANGE THINGS.
724,00:35:46.93,00:35:46.93,"BUT IN EXCHANGE, FIVE OF YOU, HALF THE GROUP VTO RISK GIVING"
725,00:35:52.70,00:35:52.70,"UP IMMUNITY, KNOWING TRIBAL WAS HOURS AWAY."
726,00:35:55.27,00:35:55.27,"CIERA, WHAT WAS YOUR VERY FIRST THOUGHT?"
727,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,>> THE VERY FIRST THOUGHT THAT WENT THROUGH MY HEAD IS I'M
728,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,WILLING TO GIVE UP MY SPOT FOR THE TEAM BUT WHO ELSE IS?
729,00:36:05.13,00:36:05.13,BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO SURVIVE.
730,00:36:07.73,00:36:07.73,AND I WANTED TO SHOW THAT I WAS GIVING A LITTLE AS FAR AS MAKE
731,00:36:11.33,00:36:11.33,US STRONGER.

733,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43,THINK?
734,00:36:16.63,00:36:16.63,>> MY FIRST QUESTION WAS WHO'S GOING TO BE SELFISH AND WHO'S
735,00:36:19.60,00:36:19.60,GOING TO BE UNSELFISH?
736,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,AND I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE WITH MYSELF HAD I NOT CHOSE

743,00:36:39.47,00:36:39.47,WAS A CHANCE YOU MIGHT BE IN THE MINORITY.
744,00:36:41.93,00:36:41.93,">> YEAH, JEFF, BUT I'M A COMPETITOR."
745,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,"I MEAN, I WAS JUST TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, KILL THE GOLDEN BOY."

1191,00:59:35.40,00:59:35.40,SO I KNOW NOW THAT THERE'S A REALLY STRONG CONNECTION THERE
1192,00:59:39.60,00:59:39.60,THAT I NOW REALLY AM WORRIED ABOUT.

1216,01:00:34.20,01:00:34.20,SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE PLAN.
