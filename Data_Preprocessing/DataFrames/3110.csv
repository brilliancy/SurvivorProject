594,00:29:59.83,00:29:59.83,CIERA IS NEXT TO GO BECAUSESHE'S TOO DANGEROUS.
595,00:30:02.90,00:30:02.90,"HER SWEETNESS, YOU NEVER THINKWITH HER THAT SHE'S SO DEVIOUS,"
596,00:30:06.67,00:30:06.67,"BUT CIERA IS SOMEONE WHO ISWILLING TO MAKE BIG MOVES,"
597,00:30:09.80,00:30:09.80,ADVANCE HER CAUSE IN THE GAME.
598,00:30:11.17,00:30:11.17,"I THINK GETTING RID OF HER, ITHINK I WOULD WORK WITH"
599,00:30:15.13,00:30:15.13,WENTWORTH.
600,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,I EVEN THINK ABI I WOULD WORKWITH.
601,00:30:18.27,00:30:18.27,I ALSO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
602,00:30:19.40,00:30:19.40,I WILL NEED THAT LATER IN THEGAME AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
603,00:30:21.87,00:30:21.87,IT TOO EARLY.
604,00:30:25.37,00:30:25.37,>> SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?
605,00:30:28.30,00:30:28.30,>> THE GUY WHO IS LIMPING AROUNDWITH AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS POCKET.
606,00:30:34.07,00:30:34.07,>> PROMISE?
607,00:30:34.60,00:30:34.60,>> PROMISE.
608,00:30:37.10,00:30:37.10,"IT'S STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEPHEN, STEPHEN."
609,00:30:40.13,00:30:40.13,>> POOPY PANTS?
610,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,>> WHAT.
611,00:30:42.03,00:30:42.03,>> POOPY PANTS.
612,00:30:42.93,00:30:42.93,>> STEPHEN.
613,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,>> I KNOW.
614,00:30:44.63,00:30:44.63,POOPY PANTS.

616,00:30:48.27,00:30:48.27,SET IN MOTION TO BLINDSIDESTEVEN AND GET RID OF THAT
617,00:30:52.63,00:30:52.63,ADVANTAGE PLAY OUT.
618,00:30:53.10,00:30:53.10,AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD BESILLY NOT TO TAKE THE
619,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH STEPHEN OUTOF THE GAME AND FLUSH THAT
620,00:31:00.33,00:31:00.33,ADVANTAGE.
621,00:31:00.60,00:31:00.60,BUT IN CASE HE PLAYS ANADVANTAGE ME AND WENTWORTH ARE
622,00:31:06.67,00:31:06.67,"GOING TO WRITE DOWN KIMMI, ANDEVERYBODY ELSE WRITE DOWN"
623,00:31:11.63,00:31:11.63,FISHBACH.

625,00:31:13.53,00:31:13.53,"LIKE, IF WE GO WITH THE GIRLS,LIKE, IT'S THE CIERA SHOW, AND"
626,00:31:16.93,00:31:16.93,EVERY MOVE THAT SHE'S HERETHAT'S MADE IS ON HER RESUME.
627,00:31:21.50,00:31:21.50,"LIKE, ALL SHE DID WAS THROW OUTSPENCER-- THROW OUT STEPHEN'S"
628,00:31:24.90,00:31:24.90,"NAME YESTERDAY, DISPFS LIKE,BOOM, DONE."
629,00:31:26.83,00:31:26.83,LIKE THE GODFATHER.
630,00:31:27.87,00:31:27.87,THIS ONE'S NEXT.
631,00:31:30.13,00:31:30.13,THE THING THAT CIERA HAS DONE SOSUCCESSFULLY IS SHE'S BASICALLY
632,00:31:35.80,00:31:35.80,UNHINGED SEVERAL GROUPS.
633,00:31:36.50,00:31:36.50,AND MY QUESTION IS WHY ISN'TANYONE TAKING CIERA OUT TO FREE
634,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,UP HER PEOPLE WHICH WOULD BEWENTWORTH AND ABI?
635,00:31:44.97,00:31:44.97,"IF WE UNHINGE CIERA'S CREW,THEY'RE UP FOR GRABS."
636,00:31:48.60,00:31:48.60,">> YEAH, TOTALLY."
637,00:31:52.57,00:31:52.57,"CIERA STILL SITS THERE AS ANEASY VOTE, BUT FOR ME, I FEEL"
638,00:31:55.53,00:31:55.53,LIKE IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST TOGET STEPHEN GONE AS QUICKLY AS
639,00:31:59.13,00:31:59.13,POSSIBLE.
640,00:31:59.40,00:31:59.40,NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OFCONVINCING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAKE
641,00:32:01.90,00:32:01.90,THE RIGHT MOVE.
642,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,"I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THEGIRLS SAY, BUT THEY WANT ME,"
643,00:32:08.80,00:32:08.80,"TASH, HIM, AND KEITH TO VOTESTEPHEN."
644,00:32:12.30,00:32:12.30,">> OH, WE'RE DOING STEPHEN?"
645,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,>> THAT'S WHAT THE GIRLS JUSTMADE US COMMIT TO STEPHEN.
646,00:32:18.20,00:32:18.20,>> YES.

649,00:32:24.40,00:32:24.40,THIS IS IT.
650,00:32:24.83,00:32:24.83,">> OH, YEAH."
651,00:32:25.50,00:32:25.50,>> THERE'S NO OTHER-->> ARE WE SURE THAT'S WHAT THE
652,00:32:28.53,00:32:28.53,GIRLS ARE DOING.
653,00:32:29.17,00:32:29.17,>> RIGHT.
654,00:32:30.37,00:32:30.37,>> THEY'VE REITERATED THATSEVERAL TIMES.
655,00:32:31.90,00:32:31.90,>> IT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
656,00:32:35.23,00:32:35.23,>> I FEEL LIKE CIERA IS THEBIGGEST THREAT RIGHT NOW.
657,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,">> NO, SHE IS."
658,00:32:39.50,00:32:39.50,">> THE ADVANTAGE DOES SCARE ME,THOUGH."
659,00:32:42.13,00:32:42.13,MY HEAD IS IN TWO PLACES.
660,00:32:43.43,00:32:43.43,"I REALLY WANT CIERA GONETONIGHT, AND I REALLY WANT"
661,00:32:46.43,00:32:46.43,STEPHEN GONE TONIGHT.
662,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,"I THINK CIERA, I KNOW SHE'S ALIAR."
663,00:32:49.83,00:32:49.83,"I KNOW SHE'S PLAYING EVERYBODY,WHILE I THINK STEVE SEN JUST A"
664,00:32:53.60,00:32:53.60,BIGGER THREAT IN THE FACT THATHE HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME
665,00:32:56.53,00:32:56.53,WHICH NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
666,00:32:57.67,00:32:57.67,>> WHY DON'T WE ALL VOTE FORSTEPHEN?
667,00:32:59.73,00:32:59.73,>> WE ALL VOTE STEPHEN.
668,00:33:01.13,00:33:01.13,>> HE'S NOT PULLING ANYTHINGOUT.
669,00:33:03.10,00:33:03.10,"AS LONG AS IT'S A BLINDSIDE, WEALL VOTE STEPHEN."
670,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,>> IT'S A BAD MOVE.
671,00:33:08.50,00:33:08.50,SOME PEOPLE SAYING MAYBE THEYWANT TO VOTE STEPHEN OUT BECAUSE
672,00:33:10.83,00:33:10.83,OF HIS ADVANTAGE.
673,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GREATIDEA RIGHT NOW.
674,00:33:14.17,00:33:14.17,I HAVE TWO IDOLS.
675,00:33:16.20,00:33:16.20,BUT I NEED STEPHEN.
676,00:33:17.77,00:33:17.77,STEPHEN AT LEAST HAS MY BACK.
677,00:33:19.47,00:33:19.47,I WANT STEVE TONE STAY.
678,00:33:21.20,00:33:21.20,STEPHEN TRUSTS ME.
679,00:33:22.37,00:33:22.37,CIERA HAS NO LOYALTY TO ANYBODY.
680,00:33:23.73,00:33:23.73,SHE'S A FREE AGENT.
681,00:33:25.63,00:33:25.63,SHE'LL FLOAT ANYWHERE JUST TOKEEP GOING.
682,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,>> OKAY.
683,00:33:27.60,00:33:27.60,>> STEPHEN WILL STAY WITH US.
684,00:33:28.60,00:33:28.60,">> IF STEPHEN HAS THE ABILITY TOMAKE A MOVE, HE WILL."
685,00:33:31.07,00:33:31.07,AND THAT ADVANTAGE MIGHT GIVEHIM THE ABILITY TO MAKE A MOVE.
686,00:33:35.57,00:33:35.57,SO JEREMY IS ADAMANT.
687,00:33:38.40,00:33:38.40,IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.
688,00:33:39.23,00:33:39.23,IT'S A MISTAKE TO GET RID OFSTEPHEN.
689,00:33:42.07,00:33:42.07,I WILL NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITHSTEVE NEN THIS GAME.
690,00:33:44.47,00:33:44.47,STEPHEN WHO HAS AN ADVANTAGE.
691,00:33:45.53,00:33:45.53,STEPHEN WHO IS CLOSER WITH KIMMITHAN ANY TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE
692,00:33:48.60,00:33:48.60,"GAME, WHO COULD EASILY FLIP ONUS, MOREACY EASLEY THAN CIERA."
693,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,>> YOU'RE GIVING HER SO MUCHTRACTION.
694,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,"WE'VE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP,THOUGH."

697,00:34:06.97,00:34:06.97,BUT WHEN BOTH OF US ARE 100%CONVINCED THAT THE OTHER IS
698,00:34:12.30,00:34:12.30,"WRONG, ME THAT STEPHEN MUST GO,AND JEREMY THAT CIERA MUST GO,"
699,00:34:16.43,00:34:16.43,SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE.
700,00:34:17.57,00:34:17.57,SOMETHING HAS TO BREAK.
701,00:34:19.27,00:34:19.27,I HOPE STEPHEN'S GOING HOME.
702,00:34:20.93,00:34:20.93,BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOINGTO HAPPEN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
703,00:34:46.10,00:34:46.10,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING INTHE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
