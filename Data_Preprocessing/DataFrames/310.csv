3,00:00:07.43,00:00:07.43,- I will not livewith a snake.
4,00:00:09.17,00:00:09.17,I will cut the head off ofwhoever it is that did this.
5,00:00:11.73,00:00:11.73,- It was me and I want to keepquiet for a while longer.
6,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77,- Ethan wonthe reward challenge
7,00:00:17.47,00:00:17.47,and chose Lex to joinhim on an excursion
8,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,to barter goatsfor food and gifts.
9,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,"- As a life experience,it was a day I will never,"
10,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70,"ever, forgetfor the rest of my life."
11,00:00:28.37,00:00:28.37,"- Back at camp,Lex condemned Kelly"
12,00:00:30.60,00:00:30.60,for a vote shenever cast.
13,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,- There is absolutelyno doubt in my mind now.
14,00:00:34.50,00:00:34.50,- That she's the rat?
15,00:00:36.00,00:00:36.00,- Kelly tried to saveherself by joining forces
16,00:00:38.13,00:00:38.13,with the ex-membersof Samburu--
17,00:00:40.03,00:00:40.03,"Teresa, Frank,Kim and Brandon."
18,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97,- I feel like my only realstrategy is to try to defect.
19,00:00:46.47,00:00:46.47,"- But at Tribal Council,"
20,00:00:47.87,00:00:47.87,Brandon turnedon the ex-Samburus
21,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83,and joined Lex tovote off Kelly.
22,00:00:52.33,00:00:52.33,Kelly.
23,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,Eight are left.
24,00:00:58.60,00:00:58.60,Who will be the next to go?
25,00:01:01.93,00:01:01.93,(singingin native language)
26,00:01:05.40,00:01:05.40,♪♪
27,00:02:13.73,00:02:13.73,(rooster crowing)
28,00:02:22.83,00:02:22.83,- The mood in campthis morning is pretty grim.
29,00:02:27.60,00:02:27.60,We had an emotion-packedTribal Council last night.
30,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,The mood is heavy.
31,00:02:35.73,00:02:35.73,"There's definitely two kind ofdivisions here, you know--"
32,00:02:39.80,00:02:39.80,people that voted for Lex;people that voted for Kelly;
33,00:02:43.73,00:02:43.73,and we're waiting forthe smoke and ash to settle
34,00:02:46.70,00:02:46.70,before we can figure outkind of what's going on.
35,00:02:48.63,00:02:48.63,But the biggest issue inthe game right now is--
36,00:02:50.33,00:02:50.33,"is trust andwho do you trust,"
37,00:02:53.00,00:02:53.00,"and who do youbelieve, and, you know,"
38,00:02:55.33,00:02:55.33,"that's,that's kind of the--"
39,00:02:57.07,00:02:57.07,"when you think about itin life,"
40,00:02:58.20,00:02:58.20,that'skind of the foundation
41,00:02:59.47,00:02:59.47,that youbase everything on.
42,00:03:12.03,00:03:12.03,- I'm going to behonest with you.
43,00:03:14.47,00:03:14.47,I don't really trust Brandon.
44,00:03:16.53,00:03:16.53,If he's willing to turn likethat on those people
45,00:03:19.63,00:03:19.63,"and on Kimand on his friends,"
46,00:03:21.77,00:03:21.77,then there'sno reason...
47,00:03:23.60,00:03:23.60,- That's what they say.That's what they say.
48,00:03:25.93,00:03:25.93,- It was so shocking to me
49,00:03:27.37,00:03:27.37,because I've trusted Brandonfor 24 straight days.
50,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,"He's been my friend,so I thought."
51,00:03:32.90,00:03:32.90,"And I thought whathe said was, you know,"
52,00:03:35.33,00:03:35.33,"going to be true, and, I'mreally burnt up today for sure."
53,00:03:38.50,00:03:38.50,"I mean,I can't understand it."
54,00:03:40.87,00:03:40.87,I was set up by somebodyI thought was my friend.
55,00:03:44.83,00:03:44.83,- Yeah.
56,00:03:47.57,00:03:47.57,- Lex has made a bond--
57,00:03:50.63,00:03:50.63,a supposedly strong bond--with Brandon.
58,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,"- I mean, let's sayyou get immunity."
59,00:03:55.60,00:03:55.60,He has no loyalty to me.He has no loyalty to Tom.
60,00:03:58.57,00:03:58.57,He has no loyalty to Kim.He only has loyalty to you.
61,00:04:01.73,00:04:01.73,- Brandon saved our skin.
62,00:04:03.20,00:04:03.20,"- I know, but..."
63,00:04:04.83,00:04:04.83,"- And I-I-I can't, I won'tforget that."
64,00:04:07.27,00:04:07.27,"And if I think that--if I think that there is,"
65,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,that-- that both Brandonand Frank are sure bets
66,00:04:11.70,00:04:11.70,"to vote for each other,"
67,00:04:13.07,00:04:13.07,"I'll go for the guythat did me a favor,"
68,00:04:14.93,00:04:14.93,not for the guy that's beentrying to screw me.
69,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,Last night we had to dosomething to save our ass.
70,00:04:19.90,00:04:19.90,Kelly was not going tobe the one to do that.
71,00:04:21.40,00:04:21.40,Someone had to act.
72,00:04:22.67,00:04:22.67,I acted and I'mregretting it now.
73,00:04:23.93,00:04:23.93,- I know you don't wantthat responsibility.
74,00:04:25.10,00:04:25.10,- I do not want to makethat decision anymore.
75,00:04:26.37,00:04:26.37,"It's a position I didn't askfor in the first place,"
76,00:04:28.10,00:04:28.10,and I've been put in itand I don't like it.
77,00:04:29.60,00:04:29.60,- I know.
78,00:04:30.97,00:04:30.97,"- There's nothing but doubtand lack of trust,"
79,00:04:32.40,00:04:32.40,and you guys need to help mefigure this one out.
80,00:04:34.13,00:04:34.13,I'm not going todo it by myself.
81,00:04:36.43,00:04:36.43,"- Now the major issuehere is,"
82,00:04:39.77,00:04:39.77,Lex is 100% confidentin Brandon.
83,00:04:42.40,00:04:42.40,"However, I'm not 100% and Tomisn't 100% convinced"
84,00:04:46.93,00:04:46.93,that Brandon will be loyalto us till the end.
85,00:04:53.40,00:04:53.40,"- I sit herewaiting on these women,"
86,00:04:55.47,00:04:55.47,"the same, all the time."
87,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,"No matter if you're in Africa,in Virginia, New York,"
88,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93,you stillgot to wait on them.
89,00:05:01.97,00:05:01.97,- It's a good thing thereisn't a mirror around
90,00:05:03.10,00:05:03.10,or it would betwice the wait.
91,00:05:04.53,00:05:04.53,"- Right, and how manywe got in there?"
92,00:05:06.07,00:05:06.07,- Three?- Too many.
93,00:05:08.33,00:05:08.33,- We got three damn women andit's-- it's still 30 minutes.
94,00:05:12.10,00:05:12.10,"Here we are in Africa,ain't got a damn thing,"
95,00:05:14.30,00:05:14.30,there ain'tnothing to do in there.
96,00:05:39.77,00:05:39.77,- This morning things werea little bit tense.
97,00:05:43.60,00:05:43.60,"I went against my group lastnight and I voted Kelly off,"
98,00:05:46.67,00:05:46.67,and so the oldSamburu tribe
99,00:05:50.07,00:05:50.07,is notvery happy with me.
100,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,I wasn't going toalign myself with Frank.
101,00:05:54.47,00:05:54.47,That wasn'tgoing to happen
102,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,and they should haveknown better than that.
103,00:05:57.07,00:05:57.07,"So, that's pretty muchmy main motivation."
104,00:05:59.70,00:05:59.70,"I'd rather be out of here,you know, in three days,"
105,00:06:02.63,00:06:02.63,than to--for anybody back home to say
106,00:06:04.77,00:06:04.77,that I had alignedwith Frank in any way.
107,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,- Frank just decided I'm goingto be a jerk about this thing
108,00:06:11.13,00:06:11.13,and that set the tone forprobably the next three days.
109,00:06:13.87,00:06:13.87,He approached me a fewdays ago and asked me
110,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,"to make an alliancewith him, and I said,"
111,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"""You know, I've got myalliances already set."
112,00:06:18.33,00:06:18.33,"I don't feel comfortable makingan agreement with you."""
113,00:06:20.60,00:06:20.60,"I mean, I was fullystraight up with him,"
114,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,and he's probablypissed off about the fact
115,00:06:23.60,00:06:23.60,"that I made some sort ofagreement with Brandon,"
116,00:06:25.67,00:06:25.67,who happens to bepublic enemy #1 to Frank.
117,00:06:27.60,00:06:27.60,"At this point now, I feelit's his time to go"
118,00:06:30.07,00:06:30.07,because I'mhaving a hard time
119,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,dealing withthat guy anymore.
120,00:06:33.00,00:06:33.00,"The guy has just becomea pain in my butt,"
121,00:06:35.70,00:06:35.70,and just having himaround brings morale down.
122,00:06:37.87,00:06:37.87,The guy's alwaysin a sour mood.
123,00:06:40.10,00:06:40.10,It's just not goodfor tribe morale
124,00:06:41.77,00:06:41.77,and I'm ready to get ridof him.
125,00:06:46.27,00:06:46.27,(flies buzzing)
126,00:06:50.93,00:06:50.93,"- The flies are terrible.- I know, they're awful."
127,00:07:07.93,00:07:07.93,- The flies areso rampant and so brazen.
128,00:07:10.63,00:07:10.63,You're waving your handand touching them
129,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,and they stillstay there.
130,00:07:15.83,00:07:15.83,"At home, you haveone fly in the kitchen"
131,00:07:17.93,00:07:17.93,and you go ballistic.
132,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,I feel like the baboons.
133,00:07:25.03,00:07:25.03,"You're like picking,picking, picking."
134,00:07:26.97,00:07:26.97,"When we go back home,"
135,00:07:28.23,00:07:28.23,"we'll probably looklike nervous wrecks,"
136,00:07:30.73,00:07:30.73,just picking atourselves all the time.
137,00:07:32.80,00:07:32.80,Betweenpicking at the insects
138,00:07:34.13,00:07:34.13,"and picking at the scabs,we'll be..."
139,00:07:40.07,00:07:40.07,- Don't.
140,00:07:41.80,00:07:41.80,"- Tom's got a massive boil,"
141,00:07:44.60,00:07:44.60,and I just can't stoplooking at that thing.
142,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50,- I feel...
143,00:07:47.93,00:07:47.93,"- It's like third eye,extra brain, I don't know."
144,00:07:53.30,00:07:53.30,I can'tlook him in the eyes.
145,00:07:54.83,00:07:54.83,I'm like looking atthe side of his neck.
146,00:07:56.03,00:07:56.03,"I mean, it's big."
147,00:07:57.03,00:07:57.03,I've never seen a boilthat big.
148,00:07:58.83,00:07:58.83,"- I have seen all these animalsout here in Africa,"
149,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,and most of the animalsthat are fit and strong
150,00:08:04.37,00:08:04.37,usually has a horn.
151,00:08:06.33,00:08:06.33,"Take the rhino,the antelope."
152,00:08:09.80,00:08:09.80,"So, I'm growing a horn to fightoff the beast that comes,"
153,00:08:13.20,00:08:13.20,and mainly it's comingfrom inside the camp.
154,00:08:16.70,00:08:16.70,"- All right, Big Tom."
155,00:08:18.47,00:08:18.47,That boilis making him crazy.
156,00:08:20.40,00:08:20.40,- Misery loves company.
157,00:08:23.97,00:08:23.97,"When you gotsomething like this,"
158,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,they just can't keep theirhands off of it.
159,00:08:28.90,00:08:28.90,- Two weeks ago he had oneunder his arm.
160,00:08:32.07,00:08:32.07,He squeezed itand it hurt real bad
161,00:08:34.60,00:08:34.60,"and it just popped,and oh, my goodness."
162,00:08:37.47,00:08:37.47,"- Oh, oh!"
163,00:08:42.43,00:08:42.43,- Tons of stuff seeped out.
164,00:08:44.53,00:08:44.53,It would havefilled up a shotglass.
165,00:08:51.33,00:08:51.33,"- Oh, my golly gee."
166,00:08:54.70,00:08:54.70,- I think it's too deep.- Yep.
167,00:08:56.90,00:08:56.90,"- The women like to squeezeand cause pain to men,"
168,00:09:00.13,00:09:00.13,and that's one way they canget back at you.
169,00:09:02.90,00:09:02.90,"Some things you wantthem to touch, they won't."
170,00:09:04.53,00:09:04.53,"Some things you don't want themto touch, they will."
171,00:09:06.27,00:09:06.27,That's your typical beast.
172,00:09:08.10,00:09:08.10,(laughter)
173,00:09:11.33,00:09:11.33,"- Two little...- Oh, yeah."
174,00:09:12.90,00:09:12.90,- Two little peoples.- Two little people.
175,00:09:16.37,00:09:16.37,- Aren't they adorable?You ready?
176,00:09:18.90,00:09:18.90,- Totally.
177,00:09:20.70,00:09:20.70,"- ""You'll need strength andagility, and brains to contend."
178,00:09:26.70,00:09:26.70,"You can't do it alone, so youeach choose a friend."
179,00:09:29.60,00:09:29.60,"The reward is for two,an evening's getaway,"
180,00:09:31.83,00:09:31.83,"so pair up and prepare tooutwit, outlast and outplay."
181,00:09:36.03,00:09:36.03,- So it's pairs and there'seight of us.
182,00:09:38.23,00:09:38.23,- I don't know whatthe fairest way to do it is.
183,00:09:40.03,00:09:40.03,"- I think if we startchoosing up, it's going to be..."
184,00:09:42.40,00:09:42.40,- It's going to getuglier than it already is.
185,00:09:44.13,00:09:44.13,"- Yeah, it's going to bedifficult, I think. You know?"
186,00:09:46.27,00:09:46.27,- We'd kill each otherbefore we get to the...
187,00:09:47.77,00:09:47.77,"- Well, we could put eightnumbers in a hat."
188,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,"- Two ones, two twos,two threes, two fours."
189,00:09:53.60,00:09:53.60,- Who's got number four?- Holding number one.
190,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,- Yeah.- Two.
191,00:10:01.00,00:10:01.00,- Three.- Big Bear and little bear.
192,00:10:04.97,00:10:04.97,- Lex and I are a team.- That's good.
193,00:10:06.73,00:10:06.73,- Who are you?- Big bear.
194,00:10:08.37,00:10:08.37,- Big bear.- And Brandon and Frank.
195,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,- Let the games begin.- Let the games begin.
196,00:10:17.20,00:10:17.20,(laughter)
197,00:10:20.57,00:10:20.57,"- Believe me, I didnot pick Brandon."
198,00:10:22.60,00:10:22.60,Brandon would be the lastperson on Earth I would pick.
199,00:10:25.00,00:10:25.00,"I cringed because I saweveryone pairing up,"
200,00:10:27.83,00:10:27.83,"and big old Tom got a bigbellyful on this one, you know?"
201,00:10:31.67,00:10:31.67,- I betterget away from you.
202,00:10:34.07,00:10:34.07,"- Frank is, man..."
203,00:10:37.07,00:10:37.07,"His disposition is about 80years old, set in his ways."
204,00:10:41.13,00:10:41.13,And for them two to get togetherand get that reward...
205,00:10:44.97,00:10:44.97,"I swear, if I was playinga dirty trick on them,"
206,00:10:48.20,00:10:48.20,I couldn't have thought of abetter thing to do to Frank.
207,00:10:50.83,00:10:50.83,- It was so funny.
208,00:10:52.63,00:10:52.63,"Of all people, Frank and Ipartnered up."
209,00:10:54.87,00:10:54.87,"I mean, we are polar oppositesof each other."
210,00:10:57.00,00:10:57.00,We could livenext door to each other
211,00:10:58.27,00:10:58.27,and never say words toeach other
212,00:10:59.80,00:10:59.80,because our livesare so very different.
213,00:11:01.97,00:11:01.97,"- Me and Kim Powers werepartners,"
214,00:11:04.20,00:11:04.20,and reallyit's the first time
215,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67,we've ever been so togetherin anything.
216,00:11:07.73,00:11:07.73,Everybody's kept us apart.
217,00:11:09.17,00:11:09.17,Look at us!
218,00:11:10.93,00:11:10.93,"Yeah, look at us."
219,00:11:12.70,00:11:12.70,"If it's physical,we're going to win,"
220,00:11:14.60,00:11:14.60,"but if it's anythingmental, we're screwed."
221,00:11:16.80,00:11:16.80,"- Come on, now.Follow my lead."
222,00:11:18.57,00:11:18.57,Let's go.
223,00:11:24.10,00:11:24.10,- Tom's going to getinjured tonight.
224,00:11:26.10,00:11:26.10,"- You can tell yourself it'sjust a game a million times,"
225,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03,but it's hard for me todifferentiate
226,00:11:30.43,00:11:30.43,between playingthe game very strategically
227,00:11:32.67,00:11:32.67,versus playing the game andbonding with people
228,00:11:35.27,00:11:35.27,and building relationships.
229,00:11:37.07,00:11:37.07,We are so...We are so...
230,00:11:38.57,00:11:38.57,- We bad.
231,00:11:39.57,00:11:39.57,- We need a team name--come on.
232,00:11:40.57,00:11:40.57,"Team name, team name,um..."
233,00:11:42.03,00:11:42.03,- Big and little.- Big and little?
234,00:11:43.47,00:11:43.47,"Big and little, yeah.Yeah."
235,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,We're big and little.- You're little. You little.
236,00:11:46.67,00:11:46.67,"- Big Tom is just sucha good, good person,"
237,00:11:49.07,00:11:49.07,"and I was totally excitedto be paired up with him,"
238,00:11:51.40,00:11:51.40,"plus he's big and strong,"
239,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,so we figurewe might have a chance.
240,00:11:54.60,00:11:54.60,- Big game here.
241,00:11:55.67,00:11:55.67,"Frank, listen--you and Brandon,"

243,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,- It's just funny seeing peoplethat are matched up.
244,00:12:06.20,00:12:06.20,Everyone's got a partner nowand everyone's happy.
245,00:12:09.63,00:12:09.63,"And boy, the thingwith my partner,"
246,00:12:12.50,00:12:12.50,my camping trip justwent to hell.
247,00:12:13.87,00:12:13.87,That's all.

321,00:16:46.33,00:16:46.33,(overlapping chatter)
322,00:16:50.90,00:16:50.90,- I never thoughtI'd see the day
323,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33,where Brandon would beFrank's taskmaster!
324,00:16:55.80,00:16:55.80,"- Yes.""Frank, you go""!"
325,00:16:57.73,00:16:57.73,- Brandon hada whip on Frank.
326,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,"- He did.- ""Go, go, go!"""
327,00:17:02.10,00:17:02.10,- And he was so damn weak hecould hardly move.
328,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,"- I'm like standing therein total shock,"
329,00:17:06.03,00:17:06.03,"going, ""Oh, my,oh, my."""
330,00:17:07.90,00:17:07.90,- I wonder if they're going toget hot dogs and hamburgers.

332,00:17:13.40,00:17:13.40,"- All right,this is your Mecca."
333,00:17:15.93,00:17:15.93,Here's your setup.
334,00:17:17.17,00:17:17.17,You've got your own35-millimeter projector
335,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,with a movie that happensto be Out of Africa.
336,00:17:23.50,00:17:23.50,- Of course.
337,00:17:24.73,00:17:24.73,"- Behind you, couple ofchairs, and of course..."

342,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,- This is tough.This is tough.
343,00:17:44.93,00:17:44.93,I just feel guilty as helleating it.
344,00:17:46.70,00:17:46.70,"- Yeah, me too.Can't you tell?"
345,00:17:48.80,00:17:48.80,"- He assumed his positionwell, I thought."
346,00:17:51.33,00:17:51.33,- I think it's the beginningof something really big
347,00:17:52.83,00:17:52.83,"and permanent withthose two, I really do."
348,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,- A night to remember-- I hopeit's a good moonlit night.
349,00:17:58.57,00:17:58.57,The key to success on this onewith Frank and Brandon
350,00:18:02.20,00:18:02.20,is working togetherclosely.
351,00:18:04.33,00:18:04.33,Hands-on participation.- Yes.
352,00:18:06.40,00:18:06.40,- They definitely found theirrhythm together.
353,00:18:08.37,00:18:08.37,There's no doubt that...
354,00:18:09.73,00:18:09.73,- They did find it.- Harmony.
355,00:18:13.13,00:18:13.13,- Mmm.
356,00:18:17.07,00:18:17.07,- I can hear them back therecracking the whip on him!
357,00:18:20.37,00:18:20.37,And it worked.
358,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,"- And if you go tothat movie tonight,"
359,00:18:22.63,00:18:22.63,you might hearthat whip again.
360,00:18:24.60,00:18:24.60,(laughter)
361,00:18:25.60,00:18:25.60,- Whoo!
362,00:18:31.33,00:18:31.33,- I'm looking for Frankto walk home any minute.
363,00:18:33.93,00:18:33.93,They'll drive Brandon home--Frank will be walking.
364,00:18:36.23,00:18:36.23,- I'm not going.- I ain't riding with him.
365,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33,- I'm not watchingthis with him.
366,00:18:39.80,00:18:39.80,"- This crazy movie, it ain'teven an army movie."
367,00:18:42.60,00:18:42.60,They didn't kill nobodyin this movie.
368,00:19:16.07,00:19:16.07,- To see Out of Africa inAfrica was unbelievable.
369,00:19:20.13,00:19:20.13,"Brandon's a competitor,and yes,"
370,00:19:21.90,00:19:21.90,I high-fived him inthe spirit of victory.
371,00:19:23.97,00:19:23.97,It still doesn't mean I'dgo to coffee with him.
372,00:19:26.43,00:19:26.43,As far as sharingthe movie with him
373,00:19:28.37,00:19:28.37,"and the reward challenge,has it really changed my mind?"
374,00:19:30.53,00:19:30.53,"No, it hasn't."
375,00:19:31.53,00:19:31.53,"I'm still old-fashioned,you know."
376,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,Don't even go there.
377,00:19:34.83,00:19:34.83,- Frank is somebodythat in my real life
378,00:19:36.87,00:19:36.87,I would never bearound.
379,00:19:38.27,00:19:38.27,"Frank is very abrasive and,you know, kind of cold,"
380,00:19:41.47,00:19:41.47,and he doesn't havethat kind of warm side
381,00:19:43.10,00:19:43.10,"to offset his, um...less-than-charming personality."
382,00:19:49.63,00:19:49.63,- I take the cards that I'mdealt with
383,00:19:51.03,00:19:51.03,and make the best of them.
384,00:19:52.13,00:19:52.13,"It was difficult enoughfor me personally,"
385,00:19:54.23,00:19:54.23,"but, hey, it's a movie."
386,00:19:55.43,00:19:55.43,Be quietand watch the damn movie.
387,00:19:57.17,00:19:57.17,"Yeah, the company could havebeen better,"
388,00:19:58.60,00:19:58.60,but we simply had popcorn.
389,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,We had pop.We watched a movie.
390,00:20:01.83,00:20:01.83,It's history.It's over with.
391,00:20:02.83,00:20:02.83,Let's move forward.
392,00:20:26.97,00:20:26.97,- Quit eatingall the white ones.
393,00:20:28.33,00:20:28.33,- Are there really no more?
394,00:20:29.70,00:20:29.70,"- Nope, they're all gone.You ate them all."
395,00:20:31.33,00:20:31.33,"- Liar, I saw you eat some."
396,00:20:51.17,00:20:51.17,- Where does Brandonfit in now?
397,00:20:52.33,00:20:52.33,That's what's become verycomplicated.
398,00:20:53.53,00:20:53.53,Because Brandonhelped save our skins.
399,00:20:56.50,00:20:56.50,Brandon did us a favor.
400,00:20:58.57,00:20:58.57,"However, Tom and Ethanare not in agreement."
401,00:21:01.27,00:21:01.27,They stilldon't trust him
402,00:21:02.37,00:21:02.37,and they're actuallytalking about
403,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,"wanting to voteBrandon out next,"
404,00:21:05.70,00:21:05.70,which I have a hard timeunderstanding.
405,00:21:07.87,00:21:07.87,I don't think I'm goingto be able to do that.
406,00:21:10.13,00:21:10.13,This is one situation
407,00:21:11.57,00:21:11.57,where I may have to voteoutside my fray.
408,00:21:13.50,00:21:13.50,"- I'm debating, you know,is your word just your word"
409,00:21:16.93,00:21:16.93,or does your word havea different level of words?
410,00:21:19.07,00:21:19.07,"Like, is your wordwith Brandon"
411,00:21:21.40,00:21:21.40,just as importantas your word with us?
412,00:21:23.30,00:21:23.30,"- No, it's-- I mean, my wordwith you guys"
413,00:21:26.43,00:21:26.43,goes to the end ofthe game.
414,00:21:28.07,00:21:28.07,- So when does your wordwith Brandon go?
415,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,"- I guess, if Brandon--you guys get rid of Brandon."
416,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,"- Well, Jungle Jim, did yousee anything out there?"
417,00:21:47.87,00:21:47.87,- Just a few gazelles theresnorting at me.
418,00:21:52.73,00:21:52.73,- How you feeling today?
419,00:21:55.07,00:21:55.07,- The big boy has beensmelling a little rat.
420,00:21:58.13,00:21:58.13,How did Lex and Brandonget so tight all of a sudden?
421,00:22:04.13,00:22:04.13,- I give youmy word of honor:
422,00:22:06.20,00:22:06.20,Brandon is going downbefore you.
423,00:22:09.10,00:22:09.10,- I heard you.
424,00:22:10.50,00:22:10.50,"But see, since Lex said no,I've got to go"
425,00:22:13.33,00:22:13.33,across tribal boundariesand get me more votes.
426,00:22:17.47,00:22:17.47,- I'm presuming you got an axto grind with me tomorrow night.
427,00:22:21.30,00:22:21.30,- Yeah.- That's what I thought.
428,00:22:23.67,00:22:23.67,- Huh?- That's what I thought.
429,00:22:25.63,00:22:25.63,- I like Tom.Tom reminds me of back home.
430,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,"You know,only things are slow,"
431,00:22:29.17,00:22:29.17,firm-- things get done.
432,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,"You know, there's nopolitical correctness."
433,00:22:33.57,00:22:33.57,We're just men of action
434,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,and we just do our joband get it done.
435,00:22:37.33,00:22:37.33,"I should have met Tomfrom day one, you know?"
436,00:22:39.53,00:22:39.53,I'm going down low.
437,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"I respect his originalalliance, you know,"
438,00:22:44.37,00:22:44.37,"with the Boran members,"
439,00:22:45.73,00:22:45.73,but I sense he's growinguneasy with that.
440,00:22:48.50,00:22:48.50,"He sees some changes,obviously,"
441,00:22:50.13,00:22:50.13,with Lex's recruitment ofBrandon right next to his side.
442,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,"You know,he doesn't like that."
443,00:22:54.53,00:22:54.53,People arechanging their mind
444,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,like their changingtheir underwear.
445,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,- Here's the thing.
446,00:23:14.07,00:23:14.07,"The more I thought about it,the more I thought, you know,"
447,00:23:15.50,00:23:15.50,I just wanted toget rid of Kelly
448,00:23:17.03,00:23:17.03,because she was likedouble-talking.
449,00:23:18.70,00:23:18.70,- Then you shouldhave told me.
450,00:23:19.90,00:23:19.90,I would have nevervoted for Lex.
451,00:23:21.50,00:23:21.50,"- I know, but there was no wayin the line-- I mean,"
452,00:23:23.60,00:23:23.60,I didn'tknow what to say in the line
453,00:23:24.90,00:23:24.90,with them watching us.
454,00:23:26.23,00:23:26.23,- You could have just pulled measide for two seconds.
455,00:23:27.73,00:23:27.73,I don't care ifLex was watching you.
456,00:23:29.23,00:23:29.23,Because you owed it to mebecause you were my friend.
457,00:23:30.90,00:23:30.90,- I do owe...I'm still your friend.
458,00:23:32.33,00:23:32.33,It didn't have anythingto do with that.
459,00:23:34.87,00:23:34.87,Matches.Something to do with fire.
460,00:23:37.67,00:23:37.67,Well.
461,00:23:39.47,00:23:39.47,"Just vote for menext time or whatever,"
462,00:23:41.53,00:23:41.53,because I can't takehearing you say stuff about me.
463,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50,You know what I mean?
464,00:23:45.57,00:23:45.57,I don't want to hear thatanymore.
465,00:23:46.67,00:23:46.67,It just... it hurts me.
466,00:23:48.80,00:23:48.80,"You're the only person I careabout out here,"
467,00:23:50.27,00:23:50.27,so I just--I can't take that.
468,00:23:51.87,00:23:51.87,"You're still my friend,"
469,00:23:53.50,00:23:53.50,and you're going to bemy friend forever.
470,00:23:55.57,00:23:55.57,- I appreciate that.
471,00:24:07.80,00:24:07.80,"- Okay, you all go aheadand read it."
472,00:24:09.90,00:24:09.90,It's better forsome of you than others.
473,00:24:11.80,00:24:11.80,"- It says, ""Earth, wind, andfire, elements to win this game."
474,00:24:14.93,00:24:14.93,"""The object's pretty simple:be the first to make a flame."
475,00:24:17.60,00:24:17.60,"""It's done here every day,but it may cause some strife,"
476,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,"""and withTribal Council pending,"
477,00:24:21.23,00:24:21.23,"fire represents your life."""
478,00:24:22.87,00:24:22.87,- Wow. Oh!
479,00:24:27.03,00:24:27.03,- The immunity challenge
480,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"feels very important to me,personally."
481,00:24:31.03,00:24:31.03,"I mean, I am now in the mostvulnerable position"
482,00:24:34.53,00:24:34.53,of anyone in our tribe.
483,00:24:37.43,00:24:37.43,"I have the most, as I know--as far as I know,"
484,00:24:39.90,00:24:39.90,I've got the mostvotes against me.
485,00:24:41.43,00:24:41.43,So I'm going to do everythingI can to win immunity.
486,00:24:44.40,00:24:44.40,"- Depending on who winsimmunity,"
487,00:24:46.07,00:24:46.07,it's going to puta whole spin on this game
488,00:24:48.33,00:24:48.33,and itwill be very interesting
489,00:24:49.87,00:24:49.87,to see who gets voted offnext.
490,00:24:51.33,00:24:51.33,"I mean, it couldvery well be me."
491,00:24:53.97,00:24:53.97,And a lot of peoplewant to vote Brandon off.
492,00:24:55.60,00:24:55.60,I know Teresa still thinks wemight be able to vote Lex out.
493,00:24:58.77,00:24:58.77,So it's going to be veryinteresting
494,00:25:01.20,00:25:01.20,"and whoever wins immunity,"
495,00:25:02.77,00:25:02.77,it will be hugelyimportant this time.

504,00:25:44.63,00:25:44.63,"Well, if there's one thing youguys had to have learned by now,"
505,00:25:47.43,00:25:47.43,it is how importantfire is for survival.
506,00:25:50.93,00:25:50.93,"And after 26 days,"
507,00:25:52.67,00:25:52.67,all eight of you should knowhow to make fire.

512,00:26:03.93,00:26:03.93,Bring it back.Put it in your fire circle.
513,00:26:05.87,00:26:05.87,"Then, usinga magnifying glass,"
514,00:26:08.07,00:26:08.07,"the bright light of the sun,"
515,00:26:09.60,00:26:09.60,you'll attempt tocreate fire.
516,00:26:12.27,00:26:12.27,"The goal is, get your flamehigh enough to light the wick,"
517,00:26:16.53,00:26:16.53,which will drop the bagand raise the flag.
518,00:26:19.37,00:26:19.37,"First person to raisetheir flag wins immunity,"
519,00:26:22.70,00:26:22.70,"guarantees himself threemore days in Africa,"
520,00:26:25.53,00:26:25.53,and a one-in-seven shotat a million bucks.
521,00:26:27.80,00:26:27.80,Only one rule:None of the material you gather
522,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57,"can touch any part of yourstructure, including the wick."
523,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,Only the flamecan touch your wick.
524,00:26:35.57,00:26:35.57,"Anything other than the fire,you'll be disqualified."
525,00:26:38.87,00:26:38.87,"Take your positions.Wait for my ""go."""

559,00:30:32.50,00:30:32.50,psychologically ofworking out that way.
560,00:30:34.57,00:30:34.57,You just-- it becomes lessand less an option
561,00:30:37.40,00:30:37.40,"to take that longwalk out, you know,"
562,00:30:39.73,00:30:39.73,out of the game.

570,00:30:57.40,00:30:57.40,and howwe're going to vote.
571,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,I've alreadyindicated to them
572,00:30:59.70,00:30:59.70,"that if they decide thatBrandon's the mark,"
573,00:31:01.47,00:31:01.47,then I can't votethat way
574,00:31:02.70,00:31:02.70,and they better be able tofigure out a way
575,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,"to get extra votes,or else our coalition,"
576,00:31:06.63,00:31:06.63,"our allianceis going to go down,"
577,00:31:09.07,00:31:09.07,and they're going to beable to pick us off one by one.
578,00:31:18.60,00:31:18.60,- You can't letyour personal feelings
579,00:31:20.83,00:31:20.83,get involved here anymore.
580,00:31:22.53,00:31:22.53,I don't care if you likeFrank more than Brandon.
581,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53,Brandon helped us outand he may do it again.
582,00:31:27.73,00:31:27.73,"- Yeah, but that'sa long shot."
583,00:31:30.13,00:31:30.13,"- If he doesn'tmake a deal with us,"
584,00:31:31.20,00:31:31.20,he's going tomake a deal with them
585,00:31:32.50,00:31:32.50,and then all betsare off and you're screwed.
586,00:31:34.13,00:31:34.13,Because Frankwill vote for you.
587,00:31:36.07,00:31:36.07,Don't get me wrong:he's going to vote for you
588,00:31:38.17,00:31:38.17,in a heartbeatif he thinks he can win.
589,00:31:40.50,00:31:40.50,"If he gets Brandon on board,he's voting for you"
590,00:31:43.83,00:31:43.83,and then Brandon is next.
591,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,Guaranteed.Think about that.
592,00:31:48.37,00:31:48.37,Don't take too long
593,00:31:49.53,00:31:49.53,"because if you taketoo long, you're going."
594,00:31:51.20,00:31:51.20,"- Oh, I know.I know."
595,00:31:53.03,00:31:53.03,Lex has done said he will notvote against Brandon.
596,00:31:56.60,00:31:56.60,"So, um... that's fine."
597,00:32:02.07,00:32:02.07,"But that, you know..."
598,00:32:06.10,00:32:06.10,it's kind of likegoing to the dance.
599,00:32:07.93,00:32:07.93,"If you dance with my old lady,I'll dance with yours."
600,00:32:10.73,00:32:10.73,"- I know T-bird I can count onlike my own family,"
601,00:32:13.57,00:32:13.57,you know what I mean?

603,00:32:15.73,00:32:15.73,"- I've had the samefeeling about you,"
604,00:32:17.67,00:32:17.67,and that's why I saidput the three of us together.
605,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,I think we could walkto the top on this.
606,00:32:21.40,00:32:21.40,"- Well, I'm telling you, if Ishake your hand on something,"
607,00:32:23.73,00:32:23.73,you can count on that.- I know that.
608,00:32:25.40,00:32:25.40,"- If I see you put it outthere, then I'll know."
609,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,"- I see somethingover there, maybe."
610,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,See it?It just went to the right.
611,00:32:35.20,00:32:35.20,That may just be anothergazelle.
612,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,If Frankhates Brandon enough
613,00:32:43.87,00:32:43.87,to say he wantsBrandon's gone...
614,00:32:47.23,00:32:47.23,- I knowthe way Frank thinks
615,00:32:49.07,00:32:49.07,and Frank wants to getas far as possible.
616,00:32:51.03,00:32:51.03,- That's the American way.We all do.
617,00:32:53.30,00:32:53.30,- So he will do anything--
618,00:32:55.13,00:32:55.13,even make friendswith Brandon again
619,00:32:58.60,00:32:58.60,to get further in the game.
620,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,He will compromisewhatever it is to make...
621,00:33:02.50,00:33:02.50,"- Right, but I still feel safergetting it done that way"
622,00:33:05.90,00:33:05.90,than the other way.
623,00:33:08.07,00:33:08.07,- In trusting Brandonto vote for Frank?
624,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,"- Hell, yeah."
625,00:33:24.73,00:33:24.73,- I'm ready for dayafter tomorrow.
626,00:33:27.33,00:33:27.33,"- From what I've beenable to see,"
627,00:33:29.33,00:33:29.33,"anybody who either tried tomanipulate people, jump ship,"
628,00:33:34.50,00:33:34.50,"come up with a plan Btoo soon, got gooned."
629,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,These are smart people.
630,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,"And if they seethe writing on the wall,"
631,00:33:44.13,00:33:44.13,that you lack confidence
632,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,"and you're looking tocome up with an ulterior plan,"
633,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,you shoot yourselfin the foot
634,00:33:52.10,00:33:52.10,with the peoplethat you have
635,00:33:54.03,00:33:54.03,somewhat ofan original alliance with.
636,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,So I've beenpretty steadfast
637,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,in trying to keepwith my original alliance.
638,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"I really have notfaltered from that,"
639,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,and for me that's worked.
640,00:34:04.60,00:34:04.60,At least it'sgotten me this far.
641,00:34:07.70,00:34:07.70,- Exactly.
642,00:34:09.63,00:34:09.63,"- Hey, Big Tom got his selfbetween a crack and a hard spot."
643,00:34:14.50,00:34:14.50,"I'm still going tohold to my guns,"
644,00:34:16.37,00:34:16.37,"but after the votetonight, if Lex don't help me,"
645,00:34:20.40,00:34:20.40,we may not have the tightestmarriage as we once did.
646,00:34:31.97,00:34:31.97,"- At Tribal Counciltonight,"
647,00:34:33.57,00:34:33.57,we know Kimis a big question mark.
648,00:34:35.27,00:34:35.27,I know she has a bondwith Brandon.
649,00:34:37.10,00:34:37.10,"However, he screwed her overbig time,"
650,00:34:39.57,00:34:39.57,so I don't know if she'sresentful.
651,00:34:41.23,00:34:41.23,"They said they'd nevervote for each other,"
652,00:34:43.07,00:34:43.07,but I can't count onthat 100%.
653,00:34:46.30,00:34:46.30,"I know Frank doesn'tlove Lex, you know,"
654,00:34:48.83,00:34:48.83,and they see himas a leader.
655,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,"They don't likethe way he leads,"
656,00:34:51.57,00:34:51.57,"and if they get him off,you know, they thought,"
657,00:34:53.80,00:34:53.80,"you know,they'd have a better chance"
658,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,of getting intothe final four.
659,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,They smell the final four--those guys.
660,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,That's the one thing thatmakes me a little nervous
661,00:35:01.00,00:35:01.00,about Frankand about Teresa
662,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,is they could beso close to the final four
663,00:35:05.73,00:35:05.73,if they side with Brandon.
664,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93,- We'll now bring inthe first member of our jury.
665,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,Kelly returns tonight.
666,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,Kelly will be with usfor each Tribal Council.
667,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,"And each week,one of you will join her."
668,00:35:39.43,00:35:39.43,The jury is always hereonly to observe.
669,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,You're not tospeak to the jury.
670,00:35:43.07,00:35:43.07,"Ultimately, the jurywill have the last say"
671,00:35:45.73,00:35:45.73,because they willmake the final vote
672,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,to determinewho gets the million dollars
673,00:35:49.97,00:35:49.97,and the titleof Survivor.
674,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"So before we get totonight's vote,"
675,00:35:53.47,00:35:53.47,let's talk about the pastfew days.
676,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23,"Ethan, can you capture in oneword what this game is about?"
677,00:36:00.87,00:36:00.87,What's the overriding qualitythat it takes to get this far?
678,00:36:04.03,00:36:04.03,- I'd say confidence.
679,00:36:05.40,00:36:05.40,"Confidence in yourself,"
680,00:36:08.07,00:36:08.07,confidence in your friendsthat you make.
681,00:36:10.80,00:36:10.80,Confidencein your decisions.
682,00:36:12.47,00:36:12.47,Confidence in winningthe challenges.
683,00:36:15.53,00:36:15.53,"- Brandon, do you lookat this in terms of morality"
684,00:36:18.63,00:36:18.63,and ethicsor do you look at this
685,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,"in terms of""What are the rules"
686,00:36:21.07,00:36:21.07,"and how farcan I push them?"""
687,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,"- Yeah, you know what?I do."
688,00:36:24.77,00:36:24.77,"I wouldn't do anything likeamoral or you know,"
689,00:36:29.13,00:36:29.13,"disgustingor anything like that,"
690,00:36:30.70,00:36:30.70,"but as far as justplaying the game goes,"
691,00:36:32.63,00:36:32.63,"yeah, it's a game."
692,00:36:34.67,00:36:34.67,"I came to have a really goodtime, and I have."
693,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,"- Big Tom,is this an adventure"
694,00:36:41.77,00:36:41.77,"that tests yourmorality and integrity,"
695,00:36:43.97,00:36:43.97,or is this a game thatis about rules
696,00:36:46.37,00:36:46.37,and how can I exploit them?
697,00:36:47.80,00:36:47.80,Morality doesn't play?- All the above.
698,00:36:51.17,00:36:51.17,"You know, you've got tohold all of them"
699,00:36:52.73,00:36:52.73,"before you get throughthe day,"
700,00:36:54.13,00:36:54.13,"and you've got tocheck yourself,"
701,00:36:55.93,00:36:55.93,and then you look inthe eyes of your compadres
702,00:36:58.27,00:36:58.27,"and say, ""Well, is he"
703,00:37:00.57,00:37:00.57,the same kindof man I came in here with?
704,00:37:02.97,00:37:02.97,"How has his value changed?""Or what?"
705,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,But I can't dwellon that much
706,00:37:06.87,00:37:06.87,"because whatever will happenwill happen,"
707,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,"and I can't change that,"
708,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,and out here there's otherthings to do.
709,00:37:12.70,00:37:12.70,- What is there to doout here
710,00:37:14.80,00:37:14.80,other than think aboutthe game?
711,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"- Well, Lord have mercy.I've had to watch these women."
712,00:37:21.80,00:37:21.80,I've got responsibilities.I've got to dance.
713,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,I've got to sing.It's a pretty lively bunch.
714,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,"- Frank, how big anissue is trust at this point?"
715,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,- Trust is a big factor becauseit could be the shield
716,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,that takes youall the way up there.
717,00:37:36.70,00:37:36.70,"How much there is, it'shard to tell, you know."
718,00:37:41.40,00:37:41.40,"It's very limited in somerespects, you know."
719,00:37:43.23,00:37:43.23,"We're a little brokenhere or there,"
720,00:37:44.80,00:37:44.80,"but when you do find it,it means an awful lot."
721,00:37:48.10,00:37:48.10,"- Lex, what do you baseyour votes on?"
722,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,How well youtrust somebody?
723,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,- Trust playsa huge part for me
724,00:37:53.63,00:37:53.63,and probably the singlebiggest factor
725,00:37:57.57,00:37:57.57,I take into considerationwhen voting is my gut.
726,00:37:59.93,00:37:59.93,It's how I makedecisions in life.
727,00:38:02.37,00:38:02.37,- But your gut out hereis influenced
728,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,"based on a certainset of experiences, facts,"
729,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,"assumptions, fair?"
730,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,"- Fair, but my gut stilldoesn't lie"
731,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,and my gut is stillpretty damn accurate.
732,00:38:13.20,00:38:13.20,"- Kim, how about you?"
733,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,"When you vote for somebody,is it based strategy--"
734,00:38:18.63,00:38:18.63,"""Got to get rid of them;they're too strong;"
735,00:38:20.20,00:38:20.20,"they could win it,""or is it, you know what,"
736,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,"""They're just notnice and I want them to go""?"
737,00:38:23.87,00:38:23.87,- I would sayit's the latter.
738,00:38:26.23,00:38:26.23,"But I go on ""Who am Icomfortable with?"
739,00:38:28.57,00:38:28.57,"Who will I respect in thefinal three, the final two?"""
740,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"If it's not me,who do I want to win?"
741,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,"And again,I'm a little bit like Lex."
742,00:38:37.10,00:38:37.10,I go on a gut feelingof who I respect
743,00:38:40.23,00:38:40.23,and whoI'm comfortable with.
744,00:38:41.73,00:38:41.73,"- Kim, think you'vemade any wrong judgments?"
745,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,"- Um, sure, yeah.I definitely think that."
746,00:38:47.83,00:38:47.83,I think my biggest weaknessis that I build
747,00:38:51.90,00:38:51.90,relationships withpeople and trust them.
748,00:38:55.10,00:38:55.10,"And, you know, foolishlythink that some of that"
749,00:38:58.60,00:38:58.60,"is part of the game,"
750,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,when really the game ismuch more about strategy.
751,00:39:02.10,00:39:02.10,And I think my biggestweakness is being naive.
752,00:39:04.90,00:39:04.90,"- Okay,it's time to vote."
753,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,"Tom, you're up first."
754,00:39:36.93,00:39:36.93,"- Frank, you have beennothing but rude,"
755,00:39:39.60,00:39:39.60,"grouchy and a poor sport,"
756,00:39:41.60,00:39:41.60,and the last few days withyou have been insufferable.
757,00:39:44.03,00:39:44.03,"Bottom line: you'vebeen a real downer,"
758,00:39:46.43,00:39:46.43,and I can't wait to seeyou gone.
759,00:39:48.00,00:39:48.00,Bye-bye.
760,00:40:14.63,00:40:14.63,- I don't even reallyknow what to say.
761,00:40:17.07,00:40:17.07,It's such a shamethat it came to this.
762,00:40:18.77,00:40:18.77,But I just don't trust you.
763,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,I don't know even ifwe had a friendship.
764,00:40:22.50,00:40:22.50,"I'm not even sureof that anymore,"
765,00:40:23.80,00:40:23.80,but I'm sorry thatit came down to this.
766,00:40:30.33,00:40:30.33,- I'll go tally the votes.
767,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,"Once the votes have beencounted, the decision is final."
768,00:40:46.47,00:40:46.47,The person will be asked
769,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
770,00:40:49.47,00:40:49.47,I'll read the votes.
771,00:40:55.07,00:40:55.07,First vote: Brandon.
772,00:41:02.00,00:41:02.00,Brandon.
773,00:41:08.00,00:41:08.00,Frank.
774,00:41:12.63,00:41:12.63,Brandon.
775,00:41:17.13,00:41:17.13,Brandon.
776,00:41:22.00,00:41:22.00,Frank.
777,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,That's four votes Brandon;two votes Frank.
778,00:41:28.63,00:41:28.63,The ninth person voted out
779,00:41:30.53,00:41:30.53,for the second memberof our jury: Brandon.
780,00:41:33.77,00:41:33.77,"- You guys,only 12 more days."
781,00:41:35.63,00:41:35.63,Have a lot of fun.
782,00:41:40.77,00:41:40.77,"- Brandon, the tribehas spoken."
783,00:41:48.27,00:41:48.27,It's time for you to go.
784,00:41:49.57,00:41:49.57,"- See you, sugar bear."
785,00:42:05.17,00:42:05.17,"- Well, with twomembers on the jury now,"
786,00:42:07.50,00:42:07.50,"and a one-in-seven shotat winning this whole thing,"
787,00:42:09.87,00:42:09.87,this game isgetting very tricky.
788,00:42:11.87,00:42:11.87,You guyscan head back to camp.
789,00:42:13.03,00:42:13.03,Good night.
790,00:42:30.47,00:42:30.47,Stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.
791,00:42:33.93,00:42:33.93,- Next time on Survivor...
792,00:42:35.60,00:42:35.60, Lex is in the hot seat.
793,00:42:36.90,00:42:36.90,- All he was worriedabout was Lex.
794,00:42:38.47,00:42:38.47,- Now he's got to thinkingabout me and you.
795,00:42:40.33,00:42:40.33,- Tom takes upshower duty.
796,00:42:42.40,00:42:42.40,- Tom gets away with murder.
797,00:42:44.30,00:42:44.30,- Frank shows hissensitive side.
798,00:42:45.83,00:42:45.83,- These little liberalspecial interest groups
799,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,"that the mediagive open market to,"
800,00:42:49.57,00:42:49.57,instead of the averageworking class American
801,00:42:51.63,00:42:51.63,that founded thiscountry.
802,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,"- Okay, enough!All right, enough."
803,00:42:58.90,00:42:58.90,- I cannot believeI made it 27 days.
