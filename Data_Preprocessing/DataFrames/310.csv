1,00:00:01.33,00:00:01.33,- Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20,Lex embarked on a witch-hunt
3,00:00:04.73,00:00:04.73,to find out who voted against him at Tribal Council.
4,00:00:07.43,00:00:07.43,- I will not live with a snake.
5,00:00:09.17,00:00:09.17,I will cut the head off of whoever it is that did this.
6,00:00:11.73,00:00:11.73,- It was me and I want to keep quiet for a while longer.
7,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77,- Ethan won the reward challenge
8,00:00:17.47,00:00:17.47,and chose Lex to join him on an excursion
9,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,to barter goats for food and gifts.
10,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,"- As a life experience, it was a day I will never,"
11,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70,"ever, forget for the rest of my life."
12,00:00:28.37,00:00:28.37,"- Back at camp, Lex condemned Kelly"
13,00:00:30.60,00:00:30.60,for a vote she never cast.
14,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,- There is absolutely no doubt in my mind now.
15,00:00:34.50,00:00:34.50,- That she's the rat?
16,00:00:36.00,00:00:36.00,- Kelly tried to save herself by joining forces
17,00:00:38.13,00:00:38.13,with the ex-members of Samburu--
18,00:00:40.03,00:00:40.03,"Teresa, Frank, Kim and Brandon."
19,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97,- I feel like my only real strategy is to try to defect.
20,00:00:46.47,00:00:46.47,"- But at Tribal Council,"
21,00:00:47.87,00:00:47.87,Brandon turned on the ex-Samburus
22,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83,and joined Lex to vote off Kelly.
23,00:00:52.33,00:00:52.33,Kelly.
24,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,Eight are left.
25,00:00:58.60,00:00:58.60,Who will be the next to go?
26,00:01:01.93,00:01:01.93,(singing in native language)
27,00:01:05.40,00:01:05.40,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
28,00:02:13.73,00:02:13.73,(rooster crowing)
29,00:02:22.83,00:02:22.83,- The mood in camp this morning is pretty grim.
30,00:02:27.60,00:02:27.60,We had an emotion-packed Tribal Council last night.
31,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,The mood is heavy.
32,00:02:35.73,00:02:35.73,"There's definitely two kind of divisions here, you know--"
33,00:02:39.80,00:02:39.80,people that voted for Lex; people that voted for Kelly;
34,00:02:43.73,00:02:43.73,and we're waiting for the smoke and ash to settle
35,00:02:46.70,00:02:46.70,before we can figure out kind of what's going on.
36,00:02:48.63,00:02:48.63,But the biggest issue in the game right now is--
37,00:02:50.33,00:02:50.33,"is trust and who do you trust,"
38,00:02:53.00,00:02:53.00,"and who do you believe, and, you know,"
39,00:02:55.33,00:02:55.33,"that's, that's kind of the--"
40,00:02:57.07,00:02:57.07,"when you think about it in life,"
41,00:02:58.20,00:02:58.20,that's kind of the foundation
42,00:02:59.47,00:02:59.47,that you base everything on.
43,00:03:12.03,00:03:12.03,- I'm going to be honest with you.
44,00:03:14.47,00:03:14.47,I don't really trust Brandon.
45,00:03:16.53,00:03:16.53,If he's willing to turn like that on those people
46,00:03:19.63,00:03:19.63,"and on Kim and on his friends,"
47,00:03:21.77,00:03:21.77,then there's no reason...
48,00:03:23.60,00:03:23.60,- That's what they say. That's what they say.
49,00:03:25.93,00:03:25.93,- It was so shocking to me
50,00:03:27.37,00:03:27.37,because I've trusted Brandon for 24 straight days.
51,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,"He's been my friend, so I thought."
52,00:03:32.90,00:03:32.90,"And I thought what he said was, you know,"
53,00:03:35.33,00:03:35.33,"going to be true, and, I'm really burnt up today for sure."
54,00:03:38.50,00:03:38.50,"I mean, I can't understand it."
55,00:03:40.87,00:03:40.87,I was set up by somebody I thought was my friend.
56,00:03:44.83,00:03:44.83,- Yeah.
57,00:03:47.57,00:03:47.57,- Lex has made a bond--
58,00:03:50.63,00:03:50.63,a supposedly strong bond-- with Brandon.
59,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,"- I mean, let's say you get immunity."
60,00:03:55.60,00:03:55.60,He has no loyalty to me. He has no loyalty to Tom.
61,00:03:58.57,00:03:58.57,He has no loyalty to Kim. He only has loyalty to you.
62,00:04:01.73,00:04:01.73,- Brandon saved our skin.
63,00:04:03.20,00:04:03.20,"- I know, but..."
64,00:04:04.83,00:04:04.83,"- And I-I-I can't, I won't forget that."
65,00:04:07.27,00:04:07.27,"And if I think that-- if I think that there is,"
66,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,that-- that both Brandon and Frank are sure bets
67,00:04:11.70,00:04:11.70,"to vote for each other,"
68,00:04:13.07,00:04:13.07,"I'll go for the guy that did me a favor,"
69,00:04:14.93,00:04:14.93,not for the guy that's been trying to screw me.
70,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,Last night we had to do something to save our ass.
71,00:04:19.90,00:04:19.90,Kelly was not going to be the one to do that.
72,00:04:21.40,00:04:21.40,Someone had to act.
73,00:04:22.67,00:04:22.67,I acted and I'm regretting it now.
74,00:04:23.93,00:04:23.93,- I know you don't want that responsibility.
75,00:04:25.10,00:04:25.10,- I do not want to make that decision anymore.
76,00:04:26.37,00:04:26.37,"It's a position I didn't ask for in the first place,"
77,00:04:28.10,00:04:28.10,and I've been put in it and I don't like it.
78,00:04:29.60,00:04:29.60,- I know.
79,00:04:30.97,00:04:30.97,"- There's nothing but doubt and lack of trust,"
80,00:04:32.40,00:04:32.40,and you guys need to help me figure this one out.
81,00:04:34.13,00:04:34.13,I'm not going to do it by myself.
82,00:04:36.43,00:04:36.43,"- Now the major issue here is,"
83,00:04:39.77,00:04:39.77,Lex is 100% confident in Brandon.
84,00:04:42.40,00:04:42.40,"However, I'm not 100% and Tom isn't 100% convinced"
85,00:04:46.93,00:04:46.93,that Brandon will be loyal to us till the end.
86,00:04:53.40,00:04:53.40,"- I sit here waiting on these women,"
87,00:04:55.47,00:04:55.47,"the same, all the time."
88,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,"No matter if you're in Africa, in Virginia, New York,"
89,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93,you still got to wait on them.
90,00:05:01.97,00:05:01.97,- It's a good thing there isn't a mirror around
91,00:05:03.10,00:05:03.10,or it would be twice the wait.
92,00:05:04.53,00:05:04.53,"- Right, and how many we got in there?"
93,00:05:06.07,00:05:06.07,- Three? - Too many.
94,00:05:08.33,00:05:08.33,- We got three damn women and it's-- it's still 30 minutes.
95,00:05:12.10,00:05:12.10,"Here we are in Africa, ain't got a damn thing,"
96,00:05:14.30,00:05:14.30,there ain't nothing to do in there.
97,00:05:39.77,00:05:39.77,- This morning things were a little bit tense.
98,00:05:43.60,00:05:43.60,"I went against my group last night and I voted Kelly off,"
99,00:05:46.67,00:05:46.67,and so the old Samburu tribe
100,00:05:50.07,00:05:50.07,is not very happy with me.
101,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,I wasn't going to align myself with Frank.
102,00:05:54.47,00:05:54.47,That wasn't going to happen
103,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,and they should have known better than that.
104,00:05:57.07,00:05:57.07,"So, that's pretty much my main motivation."
105,00:05:59.70,00:05:59.70,"I'd rather be out of here, you know, in three days,"
106,00:06:02.63,00:06:02.63,than to-- for anybody back home to say
107,00:06:04.77,00:06:04.77,that I had aligned with Frank in any way.
108,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,- Frank just decided I'm going to be a jerk about this thing
109,00:06:11.13,00:06:11.13,and that set the tone for probably the next three days.
110,00:06:13.87,00:06:13.87,He approached me a few days ago and asked me
111,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,"to make an alliance with him, and I said,"
112,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"""You know, I've got my alliances already set."
113,00:06:18.33,00:06:18.33,"I don't feel comfortable making an agreement with you."""
114,00:06:20.60,00:06:20.60,"I mean, I was fully straight up with him,"
115,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,and he's probably pissed off about the fact
116,00:06:23.60,00:06:23.60,"that I made some sort of agreement with Brandon,"
117,00:06:25.67,00:06:25.67,who happens to be public enemy #1 to Frank.
118,00:06:27.60,00:06:27.60,"At this point now, I feel it's his time to go"
119,00:06:30.07,00:06:30.07,because I'm having a hard time
120,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,dealing with that guy anymore.
121,00:06:33.00,00:06:33.00,"The guy has just become a pain in my butt,"
122,00:06:35.70,00:06:35.70,and just having him around brings morale down.
123,00:06:37.87,00:06:37.87,The guy's always in a sour mood.
124,00:06:40.10,00:06:40.10,It's just not good for tribe morale
125,00:06:41.77,00:06:41.77,and I'm ready to get rid of him.
126,00:06:46.27,00:06:46.27,(flies buzzing)
127,00:06:50.93,00:06:50.93,"- The flies are terrible. - I know, they're awful."
128,00:07:07.93,00:07:07.93,- The flies are so rampant and so brazen.
129,00:07:10.63,00:07:10.63,You're waving your hand and touching them
130,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,and they still stay there.
131,00:07:15.83,00:07:15.83,"At home, you have one fly in the kitchen"
132,00:07:17.93,00:07:17.93,and you go ballistic.
133,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,I feel like the baboons.
134,00:07:25.03,00:07:25.03,"You're like picking, picking, picking."
135,00:07:26.97,00:07:26.97,"When we go back home,"
136,00:07:28.23,00:07:28.23,"we'll probably look like nervous wrecks,"
137,00:07:30.73,00:07:30.73,just picking at ourselves all the time.
138,00:07:32.80,00:07:32.80,Between picking at the insects
139,00:07:34.13,00:07:34.13,"and picking at the scabs, we'll be..."
140,00:07:40.07,00:07:40.07,- Don't.
141,00:07:41.80,00:07:41.80,"- Tom's got a massive boil,"
142,00:07:44.60,00:07:44.60,and I just can't stop looking at that thing.
143,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50,- I feel...
144,00:07:47.93,00:07:47.93,"- It's like third eye, extra brain, I don't know."
145,00:07:53.30,00:07:53.30,I can't look him in the eyes.
146,00:07:54.83,00:07:54.83,I'm like looking at the side of his neck.
147,00:07:56.03,00:07:56.03,"I mean, it's big."
148,00:07:57.03,00:07:57.03,I've never seen a boil that big.
149,00:07:58.83,00:07:58.83,"- I have seen all these animals out here in Africa,"
150,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,and most of the animals that are fit and strong
151,00:08:04.37,00:08:04.37,usually has a horn.
152,00:08:06.33,00:08:06.33,"Take the rhino, the antelope."
153,00:08:09.80,00:08:09.80,"So, I'm growing a horn to fight off the beast that comes,"
154,00:08:13.20,00:08:13.20,and mainly it's coming from inside the camp.
155,00:08:16.70,00:08:16.70,"- All right, Big Tom."
156,00:08:18.47,00:08:18.47,That boil is making him crazy.
157,00:08:20.40,00:08:20.40,- Misery loves company.
158,00:08:23.97,00:08:23.97,"When you got something like this,"
159,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,they just can't keep their hands off of it.
160,00:08:28.90,00:08:28.90,- Two weeks ago he had one under his arm.
161,00:08:32.07,00:08:32.07,He squeezed it and it hurt real bad
162,00:08:34.60,00:08:34.60,"and it just popped, and oh, my goodness."
163,00:08:37.47,00:08:37.47,"- Oh, oh!"
164,00:08:42.43,00:08:42.43,- Tons of stuff seeped out.
165,00:08:44.53,00:08:44.53,It would have filled up a shotglass.
166,00:08:51.33,00:08:51.33,"- Oh, my golly gee."
167,00:08:54.70,00:08:54.70,- I think it's too deep. - Yep.
168,00:08:56.90,00:08:56.90,"- The women like to squeeze and cause pain to men,"
169,00:09:00.13,00:09:00.13,and that's one way they can get back at you.
170,00:09:02.90,00:09:02.90,"Some things you want them to touch, they won't."
171,00:09:04.53,00:09:04.53,"Some things you don't want them to touch, they will."
172,00:09:06.27,00:09:06.27,That's your typical beast.
173,00:09:08.10,00:09:08.10,(laughter)
174,00:09:11.33,00:09:11.33,"- Two little... - Oh, yeah."
175,00:09:12.90,00:09:12.90,- Two little peoples. - Two little people.
176,00:09:16.37,00:09:16.37,- Aren't they adorable? You ready?
177,00:09:18.90,00:09:18.90,- Totally.
178,00:09:20.70,00:09:20.70,"- ""You'll need strength and agility, and brains to contend."
179,00:09:26.70,00:09:26.70,"You can't do it alone, so you each choose a friend."
180,00:09:29.60,00:09:29.60,"The reward is for two, an evening's getaway,"
181,00:09:31.83,00:09:31.83,"so pair up and prepare to outwit, outlast and outplay."
182,00:09:36.03,00:09:36.03,- So it's pairs and there's eight of us.
183,00:09:38.23,00:09:38.23,- I don't know what the fairest way to do it is.
184,00:09:40.03,00:09:40.03,"- I think if we start choosing up, it's going to be..."
185,00:09:42.40,00:09:42.40,- It's going to get uglier than it already is.
186,00:09:44.13,00:09:44.13,"- Yeah, it's going to be difficult, I think. You know?"
187,00:09:46.27,00:09:46.27,- We'd kill each other before we get to the...
188,00:09:47.77,00:09:47.77,"- Well, we could put eight numbers in a hat."
189,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,"- Two ones, two twos, two threes, two fours."
190,00:09:53.60,00:09:53.60,- Who's got number four? - Holding number one.
191,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,- Yeah. - Two.
192,00:10:01.00,00:10:01.00,- Three. - Big Bear and little bear.
193,00:10:04.97,00:10:04.97,- Lex and I are a team. - That's good.
194,00:10:06.73,00:10:06.73,- Who are you? - Big bear.
195,00:10:08.37,00:10:08.37,- Big bear. - And Brandon and Frank.
196,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,- Let the games begin. - Let the games begin.
197,00:10:17.20,00:10:17.20,(laughter)
198,00:10:20.57,00:10:20.57,"- Believe me, I did not pick Brandon."
199,00:10:22.60,00:10:22.60,Brandon would be the last person on Earth I would pick.
200,00:10:25.00,00:10:25.00,"I cringed because I saw everyone pairing up,"
201,00:10:27.83,00:10:27.83,"and big old Tom got a big bellyful on this one, you know?"
202,00:10:31.67,00:10:31.67,- I better get away from you.
203,00:10:34.07,00:10:34.07,"- Frank is, man..."
204,00:10:37.07,00:10:37.07,"His disposition is about 80 years old, set in his ways."
205,00:10:41.13,00:10:41.13,And for them two to get together and get that reward...
206,00:10:44.97,00:10:44.97,"I swear, if I was playing a dirty trick on them,"
207,00:10:48.20,00:10:48.20,I couldn't have thought of a better thing to do to Frank.
208,00:10:50.83,00:10:50.83,- It was so funny.
209,00:10:52.63,00:10:52.63,"Of all people, Frank and I partnered up."
210,00:10:54.87,00:10:54.87,"I mean, we are polar opposites of each other."
211,00:10:57.00,00:10:57.00,We could live next door to each other
212,00:10:58.27,00:10:58.27,and never say words to each other
213,00:10:59.80,00:10:59.80,because our lives are so very different.
214,00:11:01.97,00:11:01.97,"- Me and Kim Powers were partners,"
215,00:11:04.20,00:11:04.20,and really it's the first time
216,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67,we've ever been so together in anything.
217,00:11:07.73,00:11:07.73,Everybody's kept us apart.
218,00:11:09.17,00:11:09.17,Look at us!
219,00:11:10.93,00:11:10.93,"Yeah, look at us."
220,00:11:12.70,00:11:12.70,"If it's physical, we're going to win,"
221,00:11:14.60,00:11:14.60,"but if it's anything mental, we're screwed."
222,00:11:16.80,00:11:16.80,"- Come on, now. Follow my lead."
223,00:11:18.57,00:11:18.57,Let's go.
224,00:11:24.10,00:11:24.10,- Tom's going to get injured tonight.
225,00:11:26.10,00:11:26.10,"- You can tell yourself it's just a game a million times,"
226,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03,but it's hard for me to differentiate
227,00:11:30.43,00:11:30.43,between playing the game very strategically
228,00:11:32.67,00:11:32.67,versus playing the game and bonding with people
229,00:11:35.27,00:11:35.27,and building relationships.
230,00:11:37.07,00:11:37.07,We are so... We are so...
231,00:11:38.57,00:11:38.57,- We bad.
232,00:11:39.57,00:11:39.57,- We need a team name-- come on.
233,00:11:40.57,00:11:40.57,"Team name, team name, um..."
234,00:11:42.03,00:11:42.03,- Big and little. - Big and little?
235,00:11:43.47,00:11:43.47,"Big and little, yeah. Yeah."
236,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,We're big and little. - You're little. You little.
237,00:11:46.67,00:11:46.67,"- Big Tom is just such a good, good person,"
238,00:11:49.07,00:11:49.07,"and I was totally excited to be paired up with him,"
239,00:11:51.40,00:11:51.40,"plus he's big and strong,"
240,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,so we figure we might have a chance.
241,00:11:54.60,00:11:54.60,- Big game here.
242,00:11:55.67,00:11:55.67,"Frank, listen-- you and Brandon,"
243,00:11:58.17,00:11:58.17,"you are a team, you are as one."
244,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,- It's just funny seeing people that are matched up.
245,00:12:06.20,00:12:06.20,Everyone's got a partner now and everyone's happy.
246,00:12:09.63,00:12:09.63,"And boy, the thing with my partner,"
247,00:12:12.50,00:12:12.50,my camping trip just went to hell.
248,00:12:13.87,00:12:13.87,That's all.
249,00:12:22.50,00:12:22.50,- Okay.
250,00:12:23.80,00:12:23.80,"For today's reward challenge, we've assembled"
251,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,a good old-fashioned  Survivor obstacle course.
252,00:12:29.73,00:12:29.73,You'll start by making your way over the cargo net
253,00:12:32.33,00:12:32.33,and across the timber tumble.
254,00:12:33.80,00:12:33.80,You'll then go up the rope climb
255,00:12:35.33,00:12:35.33,by using either the rope or the rope ladder
256,00:12:37.43,00:12:37.43,and ring the bell.
257,00:12:38.43,00:12:38.43,Next stage is the belly crawl.
258,00:12:40.73,00:12:40.73,You'll then go over a series of three walls.
259,00:12:43.27,00:12:43.27,That will bring you to a ladder.
260,00:12:44.77,00:12:44.77,You're going to assemble the ladder and use that
261,00:12:46.90,00:12:46.90,to get over the final 10-foot wall.
262,00:12:48.70,00:12:48.70,First team finished wins.
263,00:12:51.07,00:12:51.07,"The winning team will leave camp, be under the African sky,"
264,00:12:53.70,00:12:53.70,and you'll have your own
265,00:12:55.03,00:12:55.03,"private, outdoor movie experience,"
266,00:12:57.63,00:12:57.63,"complete with popcorn, candy, hot dogs,"
267,00:12:59.67,00:12:59.67,and all the Mountain Dew you can drink.
268,00:13:02.13,00:13:02.13,We've randomly selected in what order you're going to run.
269,00:13:04.90,00:13:04.90,"Brandon and Frank, you're up first against Tom and Kim."
270,00:13:08.63,00:13:08.63,"Here we go, guys. This is heat one."
271,00:13:11.57,00:13:11.57,Winners move onto the next round.
272,00:13:13.80,00:13:13.80,Survivors ready? Go!
273,00:13:21.27,00:13:21.27,"- Hold up, Brandon."
274,00:13:26.27,00:13:26.27,"No, no, no."
275,00:13:27.53,00:13:27.53,Now you're good. Now you're good.
276,00:13:28.53,00:13:28.53,"Go, go, go."
277,00:13:31.13,00:13:31.13,(bell clanging)
278,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,"- Come on, boy."
279,00:13:41.13,00:13:41.13,- It's a tight race.
280,00:13:42.30,00:13:42.30,You guys are dead even.
281,00:13:43.53,00:13:43.53,- (coughing)
282,00:13:46.80,00:13:46.80,"- You can go to the ladder,"
283,00:13:48.07,00:13:48.07,but don't start working on it without your teammate.
284,00:13:53.13,00:13:53.13,"If it's not fitting, it ain't working."
285,00:13:55.33,00:13:55.33,- This does. This has to fit there.
286,00:13:57.30,00:13:57.30,That's the only place.
287,00:13:58.50,00:13:58.50,- The square right here and right there.
288,00:14:01.13,00:14:01.13,- That's good. Get the next one.
289,00:14:02.37,00:14:02.37,Move your foot. - It's got to flip-flop.
290,00:14:06.03,00:14:06.03,- It looks like Brandon and...
291,00:14:07.10,00:14:07.10,They're up. It's theirs.
292,00:14:09.83,00:14:09.83,- Son of a bitch!
293,00:14:13.27,00:14:13.27,- Yeah!
294,00:14:17.27,00:14:17.27,- Brandon and Frank win the first heat.
295,00:14:20.27,00:14:20.27,"Moving on to the finals, guys. Take a rest."
296,00:14:22.57,00:14:22.57,Here we go: heat two.
297,00:14:24.87,00:14:24.87,"Ethan and Kim, you're up against Lex and Teresa."
298,00:14:27.23,00:14:27.23,Winners move on to the finals.
299,00:14:28.63,00:14:28.63,"Survivors, ready? Go!"
300,00:14:43.80,00:14:43.80,"- You're doing great, T-bird."
301,00:14:47.20,00:14:47.20,"- Go, T-bird."
302,00:14:53.70,00:14:53.70,- Get that foot down. Get that foot down.
303,00:15:01.40,00:15:01.40,"- You can't start on the ladder without her, though."
304,00:15:03.33,00:15:03.33,- Take your time.
305,00:15:04.67,00:15:04.67,- You want to use all your pieces.
306,00:15:14.87,00:15:14.87,- Last one.
307,00:15:17.40,00:15:17.40,"- Ethan and Kim, moving on to the finals."
308,00:15:20.53,00:15:20.53,"All right, this is the final heat."
309,00:15:22.63,00:15:22.63,"Winners are going to the movies, Survivor style."
310,00:15:25.60,00:15:25.60,Survivors ready! Go!
311,00:15:35.83,00:15:35.83,"- Go, Frank, go! - Go."
312,00:15:39.03,00:15:39.03,"- Come on, dude, let's go."
313,00:15:45.50,00:15:45.50,- Go! Down!
314,00:15:50.50,00:15:50.50,"Come on, Frank. Go!"
315,00:15:54.77,00:15:54.77,(rings bell)
316,00:15:56.63,00:15:56.63,Go!
317,00:16:07.37,00:16:07.37,"- Combination of square round. Square, round."
318,00:16:11.60,00:16:11.60,"- Come on, Frank. Go."
319,00:16:14.67,00:16:14.67,"- Go, go, go, Frank!"
320,00:16:26.77,00:16:26.77,- Got a date with Frank! Got a date with Frank.
321,00:16:31.37,00:16:31.37,"- Brandon and Frank, going to the movies."
322,00:16:46.33,00:16:46.33,(overlapping chatter)
323,00:16:50.90,00:16:50.90,- I never thought I'd see the day
324,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33,where Brandon would be Frank's taskmaster!
325,00:16:55.80,00:16:55.80,"- Yes. ""Frank, you go""!"
326,00:16:57.73,00:16:57.73,- Brandon had a whip on Frank.
327,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,"- He did. - ""Go, go, go!"""
328,00:17:02.10,00:17:02.10,- And he was so damn weak he could hardly move.
329,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,"- I'm like standing there in total shock,"
330,00:17:06.03,00:17:06.03,"going, ""Oh, my, oh, my."""
331,00:17:07.90,00:17:07.90,- I wonder if they're going to get hot dogs and hamburgers.
332,00:17:09.63,00:17:09.63,"- Hot dogs, nachos. - Nachos."
333,00:17:13.40,00:17:13.40,"- All right, this is your Mecca."
334,00:17:15.93,00:17:15.93,Here's your setup.
335,00:17:17.17,00:17:17.17,You've got your own 35-millimeter projector
336,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,with a movie that happens to be Out of Africa.
337,00:17:23.50,00:17:23.50,- Of course.
338,00:17:24.73,00:17:24.73,"- Behind you, couple of chairs, and of course..."
339,00:17:27.60,00:17:27.60,"- Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!"
340,00:17:29.53,00:17:29.53,"- Yep, hot dogs, some chips."
341,00:17:32.60,00:17:32.60,"Gorge, feast, do whatever you want."
342,00:17:34.37,00:17:34.37,"When the sun comes down, we'll start the movie."
343,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,- This is tough. This is tough.
344,00:17:44.93,00:17:44.93,I just feel guilty as hell eating it.
345,00:17:46.70,00:17:46.70,"- Yeah, me too. Can't you tell?"
346,00:17:48.80,00:17:48.80,"- He assumed his position well, I thought."
347,00:17:51.33,00:17:51.33,- I think it's the beginning of something really big
348,00:17:52.83,00:17:52.83,"and permanent with those two, I really do."
349,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,- A night to remember-- I hope it's a good moonlit night.
350,00:17:58.57,00:17:58.57,The key to success on this one with Frank and Brandon
351,00:18:02.20,00:18:02.20,is working together closely.
352,00:18:04.33,00:18:04.33,Hands-on participation. - Yes.
353,00:18:06.40,00:18:06.40,- They definitely found their rhythm together.
354,00:18:08.37,00:18:08.37,There's no doubt that...
355,00:18:09.73,00:18:09.73,- They did find it. - Harmony.
356,00:18:13.13,00:18:13.13,- Mmm.
357,00:18:17.07,00:18:17.07,- I can hear them back there cracking the whip on him!
358,00:18:20.37,00:18:20.37,And it worked.
359,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,"- And if you go to that movie tonight,"
360,00:18:22.63,00:18:22.63,you might hear that whip again.
361,00:18:24.60,00:18:24.60,(laughter)
362,00:18:25.60,00:18:25.60,- Whoo!
363,00:18:31.33,00:18:31.33,- I'm looking for Frank to walk home any minute.
364,00:18:33.93,00:18:33.93,They'll drive Brandon home-- Frank will be walking.
365,00:18:36.23,00:18:36.23,- I'm not going. - I ain't riding with him.
366,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33,- I'm not watching this with him.
367,00:18:39.80,00:18:39.80,"- This crazy movie, it ain't even an army movie."
368,00:18:42.60,00:18:42.60,They didn't kill nobody in this movie.
369,00:19:16.07,00:19:16.07,- To see Out of Africa in Africa was unbelievable.
370,00:19:20.13,00:19:20.13,"Brandon's a competitor, and yes,"
371,00:19:21.90,00:19:21.90,I high-fived him in the spirit of victory.
372,00:19:23.97,00:19:23.97,It still doesn't mean I'd go to coffee with him.
373,00:19:26.43,00:19:26.43,As far as sharing the movie with him
374,00:19:28.37,00:19:28.37,"and the reward challenge, has it really changed my mind?"
375,00:19:30.53,00:19:30.53,"No, it hasn't."
376,00:19:31.53,00:19:31.53,"I'm still old-fashioned, you know."
377,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,Don't even go there.
378,00:19:34.83,00:19:34.83,- Frank is somebody that in my real life
379,00:19:36.87,00:19:36.87,I would never be around.
380,00:19:38.27,00:19:38.27,"Frank is very abrasive and, you know, kind of cold,"
381,00:19:41.47,00:19:41.47,and he doesn't have that kind of warm side
382,00:19:43.10,00:19:43.10,"to offset his, um... less-than-charming personality."
383,00:19:49.63,00:19:49.63,- I take the cards that I'm dealt with
384,00:19:51.03,00:19:51.03,and make the best of them.
385,00:19:52.13,00:19:52.13,"It was difficult enough for me personally,"
386,00:19:54.23,00:19:54.23,"but, hey, it's a movie."
387,00:19:55.43,00:19:55.43,Be quiet and watch the damn movie.
388,00:19:57.17,00:19:57.17,"Yeah, the company could have been better,"
389,00:19:58.60,00:19:58.60,but we simply had popcorn.
390,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,We had pop. We watched a movie.
391,00:20:01.83,00:20:01.83,It's history. It's over with.
392,00:20:02.83,00:20:02.83,Let's move forward.
393,00:20:26.97,00:20:26.97,- Quit eating all the white ones.
394,00:20:28.33,00:20:28.33,- Are there really no more?
395,00:20:29.70,00:20:29.70,"- Nope, they're all gone. You ate them all."
396,00:20:31.33,00:20:31.33,"- Liar, I saw you eat some."
397,00:20:51.17,00:20:51.17,- Where does Brandon fit in now?
398,00:20:52.33,00:20:52.33,That's what's become very complicated.
399,00:20:53.53,00:20:53.53,Because Brandon helped save our skins.
400,00:20:56.50,00:20:56.50,Brandon did us a favor.
401,00:20:58.57,00:20:58.57,"However, Tom and Ethan are not in agreement."
402,00:21:01.27,00:21:01.27,They still don't trust him
403,00:21:02.37,00:21:02.37,and they're actually talking about
404,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,"wanting to vote Brandon out next,"
405,00:21:05.70,00:21:05.70,which I have a hard time understanding.
406,00:21:07.87,00:21:07.87,I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
407,00:21:10.13,00:21:10.13,This is one situation
408,00:21:11.57,00:21:11.57,where I may have to vote outside my fray.
409,00:21:13.50,00:21:13.50,"- I'm debating, you know, is your word just your word"
410,00:21:16.93,00:21:16.93,or does your word have a different level of words?
411,00:21:19.07,00:21:19.07,"Like, is your word with Brandon"
412,00:21:21.40,00:21:21.40,just as important as your word with us?
413,00:21:23.30,00:21:23.30,"- No, it's-- I mean, my word with you guys"
414,00:21:26.43,00:21:26.43,goes to the end of the game.
415,00:21:28.07,00:21:28.07,- So when does your word with Brandon go?
416,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,"- I guess, if Brandon-- you guys get rid of Brandon."
417,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,"- Well, Jungle Jim, did you see anything out there?"
418,00:21:47.87,00:21:47.87,- Just a few gazelles there snorting at me.
419,00:21:52.73,00:21:52.73,- How you feeling today?
420,00:21:55.07,00:21:55.07,- The big boy has been smelling a little rat.
421,00:21:58.13,00:21:58.13,How did Lex and Brandon get so tight all of a sudden?
422,00:22:04.13,00:22:04.13,- I give you my word of honor:
423,00:22:06.20,00:22:06.20,Brandon is going down before you.
424,00:22:09.10,00:22:09.10,- I heard you.
425,00:22:10.50,00:22:10.50,"But see, since Lex said no, I've got to go"
426,00:22:13.33,00:22:13.33,across tribal boundaries and get me more votes.
427,00:22:17.47,00:22:17.47,- I'm presuming you got an ax to grind with me tomorrow night.
428,00:22:21.30,00:22:21.30,- Yeah. - That's what I thought.
429,00:22:23.67,00:22:23.67,- Huh? - That's what I thought.
430,00:22:25.63,00:22:25.63,- I like Tom. Tom reminds me of back home.
431,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,"You know, only things are slow,"
432,00:22:29.17,00:22:29.17,firm-- things get done.
433,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,"You know, there's no political correctness."
434,00:22:33.57,00:22:33.57,We're just men of action
435,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,and we just do our job and get it done.
436,00:22:37.33,00:22:37.33,"I should have met Tom from day one, you know?"
437,00:22:39.53,00:22:39.53,I'm going down low.
438,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"I respect his original alliance, you know,"
439,00:22:44.37,00:22:44.37,"with the Boran members,"
440,00:22:45.73,00:22:45.73,but I sense he's growing uneasy with that.
441,00:22:48.50,00:22:48.50,"He sees some changes, obviously,"
442,00:22:50.13,00:22:50.13,with Lex's recruitment of Brandon right next to his side.
443,00:22:53.23,00:22:53.23,"You know, he doesn't like that."
444,00:22:54.53,00:22:54.53,People are changing their mind
445,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,like their changing their underwear.
446,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,- Here's the thing.
447,00:23:14.07,00:23:14.07,"The more I thought about it, the more I thought, you know,"
448,00:23:15.50,00:23:15.50,I just wanted to get rid of Kelly
449,00:23:17.03,00:23:17.03,because she was like double-talking.
450,00:23:18.70,00:23:18.70,- Then you should have told me.
451,00:23:19.90,00:23:19.90,I would have never voted for Lex.
452,00:23:21.50,00:23:21.50,"- I know, but there was no way in the line-- I mean,"
453,00:23:23.60,00:23:23.60,I didn't know what to say in the line
454,00:23:24.90,00:23:24.90,with them watching us.
455,00:23:26.23,00:23:26.23,- You could have just pulled me aside for two seconds.
456,00:23:27.73,00:23:27.73,I don't care if Lex was watching you.
457,00:23:29.23,00:23:29.23,Because you owed it to me because you were my friend.
458,00:23:30.90,00:23:30.90,- I do owe... I'm still your friend.
459,00:23:32.33,00:23:32.33,It didn't have anything to do with that.
460,00:23:34.87,00:23:34.87,Matches. Something to do with fire.
461,00:23:37.67,00:23:37.67,Well.
462,00:23:39.47,00:23:39.47,"Just vote for me next time or whatever,"
463,00:23:41.53,00:23:41.53,because I can't take hearing you say stuff about me.
464,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50,You know what I mean?
465,00:23:45.57,00:23:45.57,I don't want to hear that anymore.
466,00:23:46.67,00:23:46.67,It just... it hurts me.
467,00:23:48.80,00:23:48.80,"You're the only person I care about out here,"
468,00:23:50.27,00:23:50.27,so I just-- I can't take that.
469,00:23:51.87,00:23:51.87,"You're still my friend,"
470,00:23:53.50,00:23:53.50,and you're going to be my friend forever.
471,00:23:55.57,00:23:55.57,- I appreciate that.
472,00:24:07.80,00:24:07.80,"- Okay, you all go ahead and read it."
473,00:24:09.90,00:24:09.90,It's better for some of you than others.
474,00:24:11.80,00:24:11.80,"- It says, ""Earth, wind, and fire, elements to win this game."
475,00:24:14.93,00:24:14.93,"""The object's pretty simple: be the first to make a flame."
476,00:24:17.60,00:24:17.60,"""It's done here every day, but it may cause some strife,"
477,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,"""and with Tribal Council pending,"
478,00:24:21.23,00:24:21.23,"fire represents your life."""
479,00:24:22.87,00:24:22.87,- Wow. Oh!
480,00:24:27.03,00:24:27.03,- The immunity challenge
481,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"feels very important to me, personally."
482,00:24:31.03,00:24:31.03,"I mean, I am now in the most vulnerable position"
483,00:24:34.53,00:24:34.53,of anyone in our tribe.
484,00:24:37.43,00:24:37.43,"I have the most, as I know-- as far as I know,"
485,00:24:39.90,00:24:39.90,I've got the most votes against me.
486,00:24:41.43,00:24:41.43,So I'm going to do everything I can to win immunity.
487,00:24:44.40,00:24:44.40,"- Depending on who wins immunity,"
488,00:24:46.07,00:24:46.07,it's going to put a whole spin on this game
489,00:24:48.33,00:24:48.33,and it will be very interesting
490,00:24:49.87,00:24:49.87,to see who gets voted off next.
491,00:24:51.33,00:24:51.33,"I mean, it could very well be me."
492,00:24:53.97,00:24:53.97,And a lot of people want to vote Brandon off.
493,00:24:55.60,00:24:55.60,I know Teresa still thinks we might be able to vote Lex out.
494,00:24:58.77,00:24:58.77,So it's going to be very interesting
495,00:25:01.20,00:25:01.20,"and whoever wins immunity,"
496,00:25:02.77,00:25:02.77,it will be hugely important this time.
497,00:25:04.17,00:25:04.17,"I mean it always is,"
498,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40,"but this is like another really crucial,"
499,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,crucial move to win immunity.
500,00:25:30.80,00:25:30.80,"- Hello, guys. - Hello."
501,00:25:33.00,00:25:33.00,- Like falling into formation.
502,00:25:35.80,00:25:35.80,First things first. Ethan.
503,00:25:38.00,00:25:38.00,Got to take back the immunity necklace.
504,00:25:41.33,00:25:41.33,"Once again, immunity back up for grabs."
505,00:25:44.63,00:25:44.63,"Well, if there's one thing you guys had to have learned by now,"
506,00:25:47.43,00:25:47.43,it is how important fire is for survival.
507,00:25:50.93,00:25:50.93,"And after 26 days,"
508,00:25:52.67,00:25:52.67,all eight of you should know how to make fire.
509,00:25:55.37,00:25:55.37,Today we're going to find out who's the best.
510,00:25:57.07,00:25:57.07,Here's how it's going to work.
511,00:25:58.47,00:25:58.47,"On my ""go,"" you'll gather as much brush, as many sticks,"
512,00:26:02.33,00:26:02.33,"elephant dung, whatever you want."
513,00:26:03.93,00:26:03.93,Bring it back. Put it in your fire circle.
514,00:26:05.87,00:26:05.87,"Then, using a magnifying glass,"
515,00:26:08.07,00:26:08.07,"the bright light of the sun,"
516,00:26:09.60,00:26:09.60,you'll attempt to create fire.
517,00:26:12.27,00:26:12.27,"The goal is, get your flame high enough to light the wick,"
518,00:26:16.53,00:26:16.53,which will drop the bag and raise the flag.
519,00:26:19.37,00:26:19.37,"First person to raise their flag wins immunity,"
520,00:26:22.70,00:26:22.70,"guarantees himself three more days in Africa,"
521,00:26:25.53,00:26:25.53,and a one-in-seven shot at a million bucks.
522,00:26:27.80,00:26:27.80,Only one rule: None of the material you gather
523,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57,"can touch any part of your structure, including the wick."
524,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,Only the flame can touch your wick.
525,00:26:35.57,00:26:35.57,"Anything other than the fire, you'll be disqualified."
526,00:26:38.87,00:26:38.87,"Take your positions. Wait for my ""go."""
527,00:26:42.07,00:26:42.07,This is for immunity!
528,00:26:43.90,00:26:43.90,Survivors ready? Go!
529,00:27:56.67,00:27:56.67,- There you go.
530,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,"- Come on, Powers. You can do this, Powers."
531,00:28:13.60,00:28:13.60,Come on. Come on.
532,00:28:15.40,00:28:15.40,All right.
533,00:28:16.40,00:28:16.40,- Kim and Lex have fire.
534,00:28:20.43,00:28:20.43,Frank has fire.
535,00:28:26.67,00:28:26.67,"- Come on, burn! Burn!"
536,00:28:29.57,00:28:29.57,"Come on, burn, burn! Burn!"
537,00:28:31.77,00:28:31.77,Burn!
538,00:28:37.30,00:28:37.30,"Burn, burn!"
539,00:28:44.17,00:28:44.17,"- Frank, your branch touched the string."
540,00:28:45.93,00:28:45.93,I'm sorry. You're out.
541,00:28:51.10,00:28:51.10,Everybody keep going. Keep going.
542,00:28:54.93,00:28:54.93,Kim! Keep going. It's not over. Keep going!
543,00:28:59.87,00:28:59.87,You guys cannot have anything hit the wick.
544,00:29:02.20,00:29:02.20,"- All right, I understand."
545,00:29:04.07,00:29:04.07,"- Keep going. - Come on, burn!"
546,00:29:08.93,00:29:08.93,"Come on, burn. Come on."
547,00:29:13.87,00:29:13.87,- Come on!
548,00:29:30.67,00:29:30.67,"- Yes, yes!"
549,00:29:33.37,00:29:33.37,- Lex wins immunity. - Yes!
550,00:29:38.47,00:29:38.47,- Lex was first done.
551,00:29:39.47,00:29:39.47,It was a clean hit-- immunity.
552,00:29:46.20,00:29:46.20,"At four votes at last Tribal Council,"
553,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,I'm thinking you might need this.
554,00:29:49.47,00:29:49.47,- I'm thinking this is good.
555,00:29:50.47,00:29:50.47,- Congratulations. Nice job.
556,00:30:21.03,00:30:21.03,"- I've been out here for 24, 25 days now."
557,00:30:26.67,00:30:26.67,"I have a lot invested, and the longer you're out here,"
558,00:30:29.10,00:30:29.10,the more you want to go all the way.
559,00:30:31.13,00:30:31.13,"I mean, it has a strange way"
560,00:30:32.50,00:30:32.50,psychologically of working out that way.
561,00:30:34.57,00:30:34.57,You just-- it becomes less and less an option
562,00:30:37.40,00:30:37.40,"to take that long walk out, you know,"
563,00:30:39.73,00:30:39.73,out of the game.
564,00:30:41.07,00:30:41.07,You want to stay. - Sweet siesta.
565,00:30:43.13,00:30:43.13,- That's right. - Yep.
566,00:30:46.03,00:30:46.03,"- Sweet, sweet siesta."
567,00:30:49.93,00:30:49.93,- Next couple days are going to be really difficult.
568,00:30:52.00,00:30:52.00,We've got... we've got to make a decision.
569,00:30:53.97,00:30:53.97,"Tom, Ethan, Kim and I have to make a decision"
570,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,"about what we're going to do at Tribal Council,"
571,00:30:57.40,00:30:57.40,and how we're going to vote.
572,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,I've already indicated to them
573,00:30:59.70,00:30:59.70,"that if they decide that Brandon's the mark,"
574,00:31:01.47,00:31:01.47,then I can't vote that way
575,00:31:02.70,00:31:02.70,and they better be able to figure out a way
576,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,"to get extra votes, or else our coalition,"
577,00:31:06.63,00:31:06.63,"our alliance is going to go down,"
578,00:31:09.07,00:31:09.07,and they're going to be able to pick us off one by one.
579,00:31:18.60,00:31:18.60,- You can't let your personal feelings
580,00:31:20.83,00:31:20.83,get involved here anymore.
581,00:31:22.53,00:31:22.53,I don't care if you like Frank more than Brandon.
582,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53,Brandon helped us out and he may do it again.
583,00:31:27.73,00:31:27.73,"- Yeah, but that's a long shot."
584,00:31:30.13,00:31:30.13,"- If he doesn't make a deal with us,"
585,00:31:31.20,00:31:31.20,he's going to make a deal with them
586,00:31:32.50,00:31:32.50,and then all bets are off and you're screwed.
587,00:31:34.13,00:31:34.13,Because Frank will vote for you.
588,00:31:36.07,00:31:36.07,Don't get me wrong: he's going to vote for you
589,00:31:38.17,00:31:38.17,in a heartbeat if he thinks he can win.
590,00:31:40.50,00:31:40.50,"If he gets Brandon on board, he's voting for you"
591,00:31:43.83,00:31:43.83,and then Brandon is next.
592,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,Guaranteed. Think about that.
593,00:31:48.37,00:31:48.37,Don't take too long
594,00:31:49.53,00:31:49.53,"because if you take too long, you're going."
595,00:31:51.20,00:31:51.20,"- Oh, I know. I know."
596,00:31:53.03,00:31:53.03,Lex has done said he will not vote against Brandon.
597,00:31:56.60,00:31:56.60,"So, um... that's fine."
598,00:32:02.07,00:32:02.07,"But that, you know..."
599,00:32:06.10,00:32:06.10,it's kind of like going to the dance.
600,00:32:07.93,00:32:07.93,"If you dance with my old lady, I'll dance with yours."
601,00:32:10.73,00:32:10.73,"- I know T-bird I can count on like my own family,"
602,00:32:13.57,00:32:13.57,you know what I mean?
603,00:32:14.57,00:32:14.57,- Yeah.
604,00:32:15.73,00:32:15.73,"- I've had the same feeling about you,"
605,00:32:17.67,00:32:17.67,and that's why I said put the three of us together.
606,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,I think we could walk to the top on this.
607,00:32:21.40,00:32:21.40,"- Well, I'm telling you, if I shake your hand on something,"
608,00:32:23.73,00:32:23.73,you can count on that. - I know that.
609,00:32:25.40,00:32:25.40,"- If I see you put it out there, then I'll know."
610,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,"- I see something over there, maybe."
611,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,See it? It just went to the right.
612,00:32:35.20,00:32:35.20,That may just be another gazelle.
613,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,If Frank hates Brandon enough
614,00:32:43.87,00:32:43.87,to say he wants Brandon's gone...
615,00:32:47.23,00:32:47.23,- I know the way Frank thinks
616,00:32:49.07,00:32:49.07,and Frank wants to get as far as possible.
617,00:32:51.03,00:32:51.03,- That's the American way. We all do.
618,00:32:53.30,00:32:53.30,- So he will do anything--
619,00:32:55.13,00:32:55.13,even make friends with Brandon again
620,00:32:58.60,00:32:58.60,to get further in the game.
621,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,He will compromise whatever it is to make...
622,00:33:02.50,00:33:02.50,"- Right, but I still feel safer getting it done that way"
623,00:33:05.90,00:33:05.90,than the other way.
624,00:33:08.07,00:33:08.07,- In trusting Brandon to vote for Frank?
625,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,"- Hell, yeah."
626,00:33:24.73,00:33:24.73,- I'm ready for day after tomorrow.
627,00:33:27.33,00:33:27.33,"- From what I've been able to see,"
628,00:33:29.33,00:33:29.33,"anybody who either tried to manipulate people, jump ship,"
629,00:33:34.50,00:33:34.50,"come up with a plan B too soon, got gooned."
630,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,These are smart people.
631,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,"And if they see the writing on the wall,"
632,00:33:44.13,00:33:44.13,that you lack confidence
633,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,"and you're looking to come up with an ulterior plan,"
634,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,you shoot yourself in the foot
635,00:33:52.10,00:33:52.10,with the people that you have
636,00:33:54.03,00:33:54.03,somewhat of an original alliance with.
637,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,So I've been pretty steadfast
638,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,in trying to keep with my original alliance.
639,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"I really have not faltered from that,"
640,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,and for me that's worked.
641,00:34:04.60,00:34:04.60,At least it's gotten me this far.
642,00:34:07.70,00:34:07.70,- Exactly.
643,00:34:09.63,00:34:09.63,"- Hey, Big Tom got his self between a crack and a hard spot."
644,00:34:14.50,00:34:14.50,"I'm still going to hold to my guns,"
645,00:34:16.37,00:34:16.37,"but after the vote tonight, if Lex don't help me,"
646,00:34:20.40,00:34:20.40,we may not have the tightest marriage as we once did.
647,00:34:31.97,00:34:31.97,"- At Tribal Council tonight,"
648,00:34:33.57,00:34:33.57,we know Kim is a big question mark.
649,00:34:35.27,00:34:35.27,I know she has a bond with Brandon.
650,00:34:37.10,00:34:37.10,"However, he screwed her over big time,"
651,00:34:39.57,00:34:39.57,so I don't know if she's resentful.
652,00:34:41.23,00:34:41.23,"They said they'd never vote for each other,"
653,00:34:43.07,00:34:43.07,but I can't count on that 100%.
654,00:34:46.30,00:34:46.30,"I know Frank doesn't love Lex, you know,"
655,00:34:48.83,00:34:48.83,and they see him as a leader.
656,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,"They don't like the way he leads,"
657,00:34:51.57,00:34:51.57,"and if they get him off, you know, they thought,"
658,00:34:53.80,00:34:53.80,"you know, they'd have a better chance"
659,00:34:54.97,00:34:54.97,of getting into the final four.
660,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,They smell the final four-- those guys.
661,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,That's the one thing that makes me a little nervous
662,00:35:01.00,00:35:01.00,about Frank and about Teresa
663,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,is they could be so close to the final four
664,00:35:05.73,00:35:05.73,if they side with Brandon.
665,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93,- We'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
666,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,Kelly returns tonight.
667,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,Kelly will be with us for each Tribal Council.
668,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,"And each week, one of you will join her."
669,00:35:39.43,00:35:39.43,The jury is always here only to observe.
670,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,You're not to speak to the jury.
671,00:35:43.07,00:35:43.07,"Ultimately, the jury will have the last say"
672,00:35:45.73,00:35:45.73,because they will make the final vote
673,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,to determine who gets the million dollars
674,00:35:49.97,00:35:49.97,and the title of Survivor.
675,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"So before we get to tonight's vote,"
676,00:35:53.47,00:35:53.47,let's talk about the past few days.
677,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23,"Ethan, can you capture in one word what this game is about?"
678,00:36:00.87,00:36:00.87,What's the overriding quality that it takes to get this far?
679,00:36:04.03,00:36:04.03,- I'd say confidence.
680,00:36:05.40,00:36:05.40,"Confidence in yourself,"
681,00:36:08.07,00:36:08.07,confidence in your friends that you make.
682,00:36:10.80,00:36:10.80,Confidence in your decisions.
683,00:36:12.47,00:36:12.47,Confidence in winning the challenges.
684,00:36:15.53,00:36:15.53,"- Brandon, do you look at this in terms of morality"
685,00:36:18.63,00:36:18.63,and ethics or do you look at this
686,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,"in terms of ""What are the rules"
687,00:36:21.07,00:36:21.07,"and how far can I push them?"""
688,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,"- Yeah, you know what? I do."
689,00:36:24.77,00:36:24.77,"I wouldn't do anything like amoral or you know,"
690,00:36:29.13,00:36:29.13,"disgusting or anything like that,"
691,00:36:30.70,00:36:30.70,"but as far as just playing the game goes,"
692,00:36:32.63,00:36:32.63,"yeah, it's a game."
693,00:36:34.67,00:36:34.67,"I came to have a really good time, and I have."
694,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,"- Big Tom, is this an adventure"
695,00:36:41.77,00:36:41.77,"that tests your morality and integrity,"
696,00:36:43.97,00:36:43.97,or is this a game that is about rules
697,00:36:46.37,00:36:46.37,and how can I exploit them?
698,00:36:47.80,00:36:47.80,Morality doesn't play? - All the above.
699,00:36:51.17,00:36:51.17,"You know, you've got to hold all of them"
700,00:36:52.73,00:36:52.73,"before you get through the day,"
701,00:36:54.13,00:36:54.13,"and you've got to check yourself,"
702,00:36:55.93,00:36:55.93,and then you look in the eyes of your compadres
703,00:36:58.27,00:36:58.27,"and say, ""Well, is he"
704,00:37:00.57,00:37:00.57,the same kind of man I came in here with?
705,00:37:02.97,00:37:02.97,"How has his value changed?"" Or what?"
706,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,But I can't dwell on that much
707,00:37:06.87,00:37:06.87,"because whatever will happen will happen,"
708,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,"and I can't change that,"
709,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,and out here there's other things to do.
710,00:37:12.70,00:37:12.70,- What is there to do out here
711,00:37:14.80,00:37:14.80,other than think about the game?
712,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"- Well, Lord have mercy. I've had to watch these women."
713,00:37:21.80,00:37:21.80,I've got responsibilities. I've got to dance.
714,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,I've got to sing. It's a pretty lively bunch.
715,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,"- Frank, how big an issue is trust at this point?"
716,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,- Trust is a big factor because it could be the shield
717,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,that takes you all the way up there.
718,00:37:36.70,00:37:36.70,"How much there is, it's hard to tell, you know."
719,00:37:41.40,00:37:41.40,"It's very limited in some respects, you know."
720,00:37:43.23,00:37:43.23,"We're a little broken here or there,"
721,00:37:44.80,00:37:44.80,"but when you do find it, it means an awful lot."
722,00:37:48.10,00:37:48.10,"- Lex, what do you base your votes on?"
723,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,How well you trust somebody?
724,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,- Trust plays a huge part for me
725,00:37:53.63,00:37:53.63,and probably the single biggest factor
726,00:37:57.57,00:37:57.57,I take into consideration when voting is my gut.
727,00:37:59.93,00:37:59.93,It's how I make decisions in life.
728,00:38:02.37,00:38:02.37,- But your gut out here is influenced
729,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,"based on a certain set of experiences, facts,"
730,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,"assumptions, fair?"
731,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,"- Fair, but my gut still doesn't lie"
732,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,and my gut is still pretty damn accurate.
733,00:38:13.20,00:38:13.20,"- Kim, how about you?"
734,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,"When you vote for somebody, is it based strategy--"
735,00:38:18.63,00:38:18.63,"""Got to get rid of them; they're too strong;"
736,00:38:20.20,00:38:20.20,"they could win it,"" or is it, you know what,"
737,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,"""They're just not nice and I want them to go""?"
738,00:38:23.87,00:38:23.87,- I would say it's the latter.
739,00:38:26.23,00:38:26.23,"But I go on ""Who am I comfortable with?"
740,00:38:28.57,00:38:28.57,"Who will I respect in the final three, the final two?"""
741,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"If it's not me, who do I want to win?"
742,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,"And again, I'm a little bit like Lex."
743,00:38:37.10,00:38:37.10,I go on a gut feeling of who I respect
744,00:38:40.23,00:38:40.23,and who I'm comfortable with.
745,00:38:41.73,00:38:41.73,"- Kim, think you've made any wrong judgments?"
746,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,"- Um, sure, yeah. I definitely think that."
747,00:38:47.83,00:38:47.83,I think my biggest weakness is that I build
748,00:38:51.90,00:38:51.90,relationships with people and trust them.
749,00:38:55.10,00:38:55.10,"And, you know, foolishly think that some of that"
750,00:38:58.60,00:38:58.60,"is part of the game,"
751,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,when really the game is much more about strategy.
752,00:39:02.10,00:39:02.10,And I think my biggest weakness is being naive.
753,00:39:04.90,00:39:04.90,"- Okay, it's time to vote."
754,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,"Tom, you're up first."
755,00:39:36.93,00:39:36.93,"- Frank, you have been nothing but rude,"
756,00:39:39.60,00:39:39.60,"grouchy and a poor sport,"
757,00:39:41.60,00:39:41.60,and the last few days with you have been insufferable.
758,00:39:44.03,00:39:44.03,"Bottom line: you've been a real downer,"
759,00:39:46.43,00:39:46.43,and I can't wait to see you gone.
760,00:39:48.00,00:39:48.00,Bye-bye.
761,00:40:14.63,00:40:14.63,- I don't even really know what to say.
762,00:40:17.07,00:40:17.07,It's such a shame that it came to this.
763,00:40:18.77,00:40:18.77,But I just don't trust you.
764,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,I don't know even if we had a friendship.
765,00:40:22.50,00:40:22.50,"I'm not even sure of that anymore,"
766,00:40:23.80,00:40:23.80,but I'm sorry that it came down to this.
767,00:40:30.33,00:40:30.33,- I'll go tally the votes.
768,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,"Once the votes have been counted, the decision is final."
769,00:40:46.47,00:40:46.47,The person will be asked
770,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
771,00:40:49.47,00:40:49.47,I'll read the votes.
772,00:40:55.07,00:40:55.07,First vote: Brandon.
773,00:41:02.00,00:41:02.00,Brandon.
774,00:41:08.00,00:41:08.00,Frank.
775,00:41:12.63,00:41:12.63,Brandon.
776,00:41:17.13,00:41:17.13,Brandon.
777,00:41:22.00,00:41:22.00,Frank.
778,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,That's four votes Brandon; two votes Frank.
779,00:41:28.63,00:41:28.63,The ninth person voted out
780,00:41:30.53,00:41:30.53,for the second member of our jury: Brandon.
781,00:41:33.77,00:41:33.77,"- You guys, only 12 more days."
782,00:41:35.63,00:41:35.63,Have a lot of fun.
783,00:41:40.77,00:41:40.77,"- Brandon, the tribe has spoken."
784,00:41:48.27,00:41:48.27,It's time for you to go.
785,00:41:49.57,00:41:49.57,"- See you, sugar bear."
786,00:42:05.17,00:42:05.17,"- Well, with two members on the jury now,"
787,00:42:07.50,00:42:07.50,"and a one-in-seven shot at winning this whole thing,"
788,00:42:09.87,00:42:09.87,this game is getting very tricky.
789,00:42:11.87,00:42:11.87,You guys can head back to camp.
790,00:42:13.03,00:42:13.03,Good night.
791,00:42:30.47,00:42:30.47,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
792,00:42:33.93,00:42:33.93,- Next time on Survivor...
793,00:42:35.60,00:42:35.60, Lex is in the hot seat.
794,00:42:36.90,00:42:36.90,- All he was worried about was Lex.
795,00:42:38.47,00:42:38.47,- Now he's got to thinking about me and you.
796,00:42:40.33,00:42:40.33,- Tom takes up shower duty.
797,00:42:42.40,00:42:42.40,- Tom gets away with murder.
798,00:42:44.30,00:42:44.30,- Frank shows his sensitive side.
799,00:42:45.83,00:42:45.83,- These little liberal special interest groups
800,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,"that the media give open market to,"
801,00:42:49.57,00:42:49.57,instead of the average working class American
802,00:42:51.63,00:42:51.63,that founded this country.
803,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,"- Okay, enough! All right, enough."
804,00:42:58.90,00:42:58.90,- I cannot believe I made it 27 days.
