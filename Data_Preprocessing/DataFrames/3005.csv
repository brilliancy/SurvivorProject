547,00:35:41.73,00:35:41.73,"THAT, THAT THESE THREE WERE TRYING THE LOOK FOR SOME WAY IN?"
548,00:35:44.57,00:35:44.57,>> YEAH. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME
549,00:35:47.43,00:35:47.43,OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLOIT. TO SAY THERE WERE CRACKS IN THE
550,00:35:50.63,00:35:50.63,"ARMOUR, THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT."
551,00:35:53.13,00:35:53.13,THERE'S DYSFUNCTION HERE. SO I'M DEFINITELY CONCERNED.
552,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,">> Jeff: SO TYLER, WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR?"
553,00:35:59.23,00:35:59.23,WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK UP ON?
554,00:36:00.63,00:36:00.63,">> HONESTLY, JEFF. I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING."
555,00:36:04.43,00:36:04.43,WHAT WE FOUND WAS BAD BLOOD AND ANIMOSITY AND A LOT OF IT SEEMED
556,00:36:09.20,00:36:09.20,"TO REVOLVE AROUND SIERRA. >> Jeff: SIERRA, IS THAT TRUE?"
557,00:36:11.77,00:36:11.77,">> ABSOLUTELY. AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, I WAS"
558,00:36:14.37,00:36:14.37,MISTREATED. I WAS TOLD HOW I SUCK AT
559,00:36:16.70,00:36:16.70,"CHALLENGES, HOW I DON'T HELP AROUND CAMP, JUST EVERYTHING YOU"
560,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,"COULD PUT ON ME, THEY DID. >> NOT ALL OF US PICKED ON YOU."
561,00:36:23.73,00:36:23.73,">> WHEN IT WAS GOING DOWN, MIKE STOOD IN AND SAID, YOU GUYS, YOU"
562,00:36:27.57,00:36:27.57,"HAVE TO STOP. I'LL GIVE HIM THAT, BUT I FELT"
563,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,MORE APPRECIATED IN 24 HOURS WITH THESE PEOPLE THAN I FELT 11
564,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33,DAYS WITH THESE THREE BEHIND ME. >> Jeff: WOW.
565,00:36:37.70,00:36:37.70,"MIKE, THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS. YOU'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE"
566,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,"IF SIERRA WANTS TO MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE, THE GAME FLIPS AND"
567,00:36:45.40,00:36:45.40,"YOU, DAN AND RODNEY ARE IN TROUBLE."
568,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,">> WELL, I MEAN, THE FOUR OF US HAVE BEEN TOGETHER NOW FOR 16"
569,00:36:51.87,00:36:51.87,DAYS. BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT WE ARE A
570,00:36:57.07,00:36:57.07,FOURSOME OF IMPENETRABLENESS. AND IF THESE THREE WERE ABLE TO
571,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,"SEE SOME TYPE OF CRACK AND WOO ONE OF US IN, I'M DEFINITELY"
572,00:37:06.20,00:37:06.20,"AFRAID TONIGHT, 100%. >> BUT, JEFF, THAT'S THE BEAUTY"

575,00:37:14.27,00:37:14.27,"GOT THREE NEW PEOPLE OVER HERE, I GOT THREE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN"
576,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"DEALING WITH, YOU KNOW, FOR 16 DAYS DRIVING ME NUTS."
577,00:37:20.10,00:37:20.10,"I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR ME?"
578,00:37:23.97,00:37:23.97,">> Jeff: JOAQUIN, WOULD YOU HAVE EVER IMAGINED THAT YOU'D BE"
579,00:37:27.63,00:37:27.63,"SITTING AT TRIBAL COUNCIL THINKING, I'M NOT AS CONCERNED"
580,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,AS I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A FEW DAYS AGO.
581,00:37:32.73,00:37:32.73,">> I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO GO THIS WAY, JEFF, BUT WHEN"
582,00:37:35.93,00:37:35.93,PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND BASICALLY EXPLAIN THEIR
583,00:37:40.13,00:37:40.13,"REASONING FOR HATING EACH OTHER, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY EASIER"
584,00:37:43.10,00:37:43.10,"FOR ME. >> Jeff: JOE, IS THERE ANY"
585,00:37:44.83,00:37:44.83,PART OF YOU THAT'S WONDERING HOW MUCH OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS
586,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,TRUE AND HOW MUCH OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS WHAT THEY
587,00:37:49.43,00:37:49.43,"THINK YOU WANT TO HEAR? >> YEAH, THESE FOUR COULD SIT"
588,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,"THERE AND SAY, LET'S KNOCK 'EM OUT ONE BY ONE, BUT"
589,00:37:56.93,00:37:56.93,"STRATEGY-WISE, I'M ON THE VERY BOTTOM, AT LEAST JOAQUIN HAS"
590,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,TYLER. I GOT NOBODY.
591,00:38:01.93,00:38:01.93,">> Jeff: SIERRA, ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID"
592,00:38:05.70,00:38:05.70,AS BLUE COLLARS IS THAT WE DO ULTIMATELY TAKE CARE OF EACH
593,00:38:09.53,00:38:09.53,"OTHER. >> JEFF, IT WASN'T THAT MY NAME"
594,00:38:11.90,00:38:11.90,WAS WRITTEN DOWN. IT WAS WHEN WE GOT BACK TO CAMP
595,00:38:14.60,00:38:14.60,AND I GOT ATTACKED PERSONALLY. I CAN'T TRUST PEOPLE WHO DO
596,00:38:17.90,00:38:17.90,THAT. >> Jeff: BUT NO MATTER HOW
597,00:38:19.43,00:38:19.43,"MUCH YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY, YOU'VE GOT FOUR RIGHT THERE."
598,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,WHY NOT SIT TOGETHER FOR A COUPLE MORE VOTES.
599,00:38:25.37,00:38:25.37,">> RIGHT. NEW YORK I MEAN, I'M NOT STUPID,"
600,00:38:28.33,00:38:28.33,I GET THAT. THERE ARE SOME GENUINE
601,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,"FRIENDSHIPS THAT I'VE GAINED WITH THESE PEOPLE, SO I HAVE TO"
602,00:38:34.07,00:38:34.07,"LOOK AT IT AS A WHOLE AND BE LIKE, WHO DO I TRUST AT THIS"
603,00:38:37.93,00:38:37.93,"POINT. >> Jeff: MIKE, IT'S KIND OF"
604,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,"LIKE YOU WERE DATING AND THEN SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING WRONG,"
605,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,"BUT YOU STILL LOVE, YOU WANT TO COME BACK, BUT YOU GOT TO WORK"
606,00:38:47.00,00:38:47.00,"IT BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY OVER THERE AND HE'S WOOING HER,"
607,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,AND IN THIS CASE IT'S SIERRA. [LAUGHTER]

609,00:38:58.60,00:38:58.60,"SAY, SIERRA, IF YOU GOT TO GO, YOU GOT TO GO."
610,00:39:01.23,00:39:01.23,>> AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HOPEFULLY CAN BELIEVE IN THE
611,00:39:04.20,00:39:04.20,TRUST THAT YOU HAVE MADE EARLY ON OR THE TRUST THAT YOU HAVE
612,00:39:08.33,00:39:08.33,"MADE WITH NEW FRIENDS, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU CAN TRUST"
613,00:39:13.17,00:39:13.17,"UNTIL YOU LEAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL. AND THAT'S A VERY, VERY, VERY"

615,00:39:23.80,00:39:23.80,DECISION OF WHO TO SEND HOME TONIGHT COULD BE A VERY BIG ONE
616,00:39:26.60,00:39:26.60,FOR THIS GROUP. IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
