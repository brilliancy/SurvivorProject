191,00:12:22.13,00:12:22.13,>> I KNEW I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE CLUE AND KEEP IT BECAUSE MY
192,00:12:25.00,00:12:25.00,BIGGEST CONCERN IS FINDING THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL TO KEEP ME
193,00:12:29.20,00:12:29.20,AROUND AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO GO DOWN WITHOUT
194,00:12:31.40,00:12:31.40,"FIGHTING AS WELL, JUST LIKE MY MOM DID."

198,00:13:22.27,00:13:22.27,I'M SO PROUD OF MY MOM TRADE AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.
199,00:13:26.60,00:13:26.60,"IT WAS KIND OF INTIMIDATING SEEING HER WITH ARAS AND VYTAS,"
200,00:13:30.43,00:13:30.43,BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE TWO STRONG GUYS BUT SHE DID GREAT AND I'M
201,00:13:35.00,00:13:35.00,THRILLED BEYOND BELIEF THAT SHE'S STILL IN IT.
202,00:13:37.93,00:13:37.93,>> YOU YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ME.
203,00:13:40.00,00:13:40.00,I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM. >> READ YOU'RE CLUE.

205,00:13:47.03,00:13:47.03,"GOING HOME AT ANY MINUTE. I'M NOT IN A STRONG ALLIANCE,"
206,00:13:50.87,00:13:50.87,"BUT I HAVE SOME FRIENDS IN REDEMPTION ISLAND, LUCKILY, AND"
207,00:13:54.60,00:13:54.60,"THEY GAVE ME THE CLUE, WHICH I REALLY NEEDED TO ENSURE MY SPOT"

212,00:14:13.97,00:14:13.97,"THINK I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS ON THE WAY TO THE WATERFALL,"
213,00:14:17.47,00:14:17.47,"THERE IS A TREE THAT HAS A CRAZY VINE, AND WE'VE NOTICED IT"
214,00:14:22.77,00:14:22.77,BEFORE BECAUSE IT REALLY STANDS OUT.
215,00:14:24.30,00:14:24.30,I THINK THIS IS IT. I HAVE TO START DIGGING.
216,00:14:35.10,00:14:35.10,>> WHY DON'T WE HIDE ALL THE SHARP TOOLS.
217,00:14:37.57,00:14:37.57,>> NOT A BAD IDEA. >> LIKE THE CROW BAR AND
218,00:14:40.83,00:14:40.83,ANYTHING SHE CAN USE TO DIG. >> I MEAN WE CAN'T GRAB IT FROM

221,00:14:49.93,00:14:49.93,>> NOW THAT KATIE HAS AN IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE IT DOESN'T
222,00:14:53.10,00:14:53.10,WORRY ME AT ALL BECAUSE I OFFICIALLY HAVE THE HIDDEN
223,00:14:56.57,00:14:56.57,"IMMUNITY IDOL, AND KATIE IS PRETTY MUCH A NONFACTOR."
224,00:14:59.90,00:14:59.90,THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING ABOUT IS HOW TO MAKE MY NEXT
225,00:15:02.57,00:15:02.57,"MOVE, AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH MAKING"
226,00:15:05.13,00:15:05.13,"MOVES, AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT THE BAD GUY, SO I'M GOING TO"
227,00:15:07.60,00:15:07.60,HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE FOR THE TEAM AND BE THE BAD GUY AGAIN.
228,00:15:28.83,00:15:28.83,"OKAY, I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT. >> LAY IT ON ME."
229,00:15:31.20,00:15:31.20,>> ARE YOU READY? >> YEAH.

231,00:15:40.60,00:15:40.60,COMING AND SO CIERA DOESN'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR HER MOM.
232,00:15:43.70,00:15:43.70,">> SPLIT UP THAT PAIR. >> YES, AND CIERA WE CAN PULL"
233,00:15:47.43,00:15:47.43,BACK IN BECAUSE WE SAY WE DON'T WANT TO YOU VOTE FOR YOUR MOMMA.
234,00:15:51.27,00:15:51.27,THE SAFE BET IS TAKE LAURA M. OUT BEFORE SHE GETS FURTHER IN
235,00:15:54.90,00:15:54.90,THE GAME AND COLLABORATES WITH SOMEONE WITH HER DAUGHTER
236,00:15:57.03,00:15:57.03,BECAUSE THEN THERE ARE TWO VOTES THAT YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT
237,00:15:59.40,00:15:59.40,"INSTEAD OF JUST ONE. LAURA M. GOES, HOPEFULLY BEAT"
238,00:16:02.53,00:16:02.53,"SOME PEOPLE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND, AND THEN CIERA'S IN WITH"
239,00:16:05.27,00:16:05.27,"US, AND THEN WE CAN DO KATIE AND MONICA."

244,00:16:16.23,00:16:16.23,I THINK I CAN TRUST HIM. DO I WANT TO GET RID OF LAURA
245,00:16:19.83,00:16:19.83,M.? DO WE MAKE A BIG MOVE NOW?
246,00:16:21.63,00:16:21.63,DO WE STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING?
247,00:16:24.33,00:16:24.33,IT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TREAD CAREFULLY OUT HERE
248,00:16:26.70,00:16:26.70,BECAUSE ONE MISTAKE COULD COST YOU A MILLION DOLLARS.
249,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33,>> GOOD CHALLENGE TOMORROW. >> YEAH.
250,00:16:30.57,00:16:30.57,>> WE HAVE TO WIN. >> LAURA CAN'T WIN BECAUSE THIS
251,00:16:32.67,00:16:32.67,IS OUR OWN CHANCE TO GET HER BEFORE SHE'S GOING TO START
252,00:16:35.73,00:16:35.73,SUSPECTING US. >> YEAH.
253,00:16:36.60,00:16:36.60,>> IF WE MAKE THIS MOVE-- >> HOME FREE.
254,00:16:38.60,00:16:38.60,>> THEN WE'RE HOME FREE. >> I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE BEEN
255,00:16:52.53,00:16:52.53,WEARING MY SHIRT THIS WHOLE TIME LIKE AN IDIOT.
256,00:16:55.43,00:16:55.43,"THERE YOU GO, LADIES. YOU'RE WELCOME."
257,00:16:58.40,00:16:58.40,I LIKE LAURA. SHE LOVES MY JOKES.
258,00:17:02.07,00:17:02.07,KATIE IS JUST SO-SO ON MOST OF THEM.
259,00:17:04.30,00:17:04.30,">> I'M IN THIS ALLIANCE WITH SEVEN, BUT THERE ARE FOUR GUYS"
260,00:17:06.97,00:17:06.97,IN OUR ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW. IT WILL BE SO EASY FOR THEM TO
261,00:17:10.33,00:17:10.33,GET RID OF ME AND MY MOM. WE'RE THE ONLY COUPLE IN THE
262,00:17:13.27,00:17:13.27,GROUP. IF I GO WITH MY MOM RIGHT NOW
263,00:17:15.30,00:17:15.30,"AND SAY LET'S TRY TO GET TO THE END, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN."
264,00:17:18.50,00:17:18.50,"SHE'LL BE VOTED OUT, AND I'LL BE NEXT."
265,00:17:21.23,00:17:21.23,"AND IT'S A CONVERSATION I HAVE TO HAVE SOON, AND IT'S SO HARD"
266,00:17:23.93,00:17:23.93,FOR ME. IT'S LIKE A TOTAL-- LIKE MY
267,00:17:26.43,00:17:26.43,HEART IS JUST BEING TUGGED BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT.
268,00:17:29.03,00:17:29.03,"I LOVE MY MOM, AND I DON'T WANT HER TO THINK THAT I DON'T WANT"
269,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,"HER TO SUCCEED IN THE GAME, BUT I MEAN, I-- I WANT TO SUCCEED IN"
270,00:17:36.67,00:17:36.67,THE GAME. LET'S TAKE IT STEP PIE STEP
271,00:17:38.67,00:17:38.67,REALLY QUICK AND JUST THINK THROUGH OUR OPTIONS.
272,00:17:40.47,00:17:40.47,>> OKAY. >> WE'RE AT EIGHT.
273,00:17:42.03,00:17:42.03,>> RIGHT. >> IF KATIE GETS AN IDOL THIS

275,00:17:48.03,00:17:48.03,LET'S JUST ASSUME SHE DOES. >> OKAY.
276,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,>> THE PLAN IS MONICA. OKAY.
277,00:17:54.83,00:17:54.83,AND THEN NOW IT'S DOWN TO SEVEN. >> RIGHT.
278,00:17:56.87,00:17:56.87,">> IF YOU WERE NOT IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW, I KNOW I'D BE IN THE"
279,00:18:01.10,00:18:01.10,FINAL CIRCLE. >> HERE'S THE DEAL-- WOULD YOU
280,00:18:04.47,00:18:04.47,WIN? THEY WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL
281,00:18:05.77,00:18:05.77,THREE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN BEAT YOU.
282,00:18:07.63,00:18:07.63,">> I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD WIN, BUT I THINK I HAVE A BETTER SHOT"
283,00:18:10.83,00:18:10.83,AT WINNING THAN YOU WOULD. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MAKE IT TO
284,00:18:12.97,00:18:12.97,"THE FINAL THREE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO WIN EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE"
285,00:18:15.70,00:18:15.70,FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. I'VE DEFINITELY HAD TO HAVE
286,00:18:18.03,00:18:18.03,"CONVERSATIONS WITH MY MOM THAT HAVE BEEN HARD IN MY LIFE, ONE"
287,00:18:20.53,00:18:20.53,"THAT COMES BACK IS WHEN I GOT PREGNANT, HAVING TO HAVE THAT"
288,00:18:23.27,00:18:23.27,CONVERSATION WITH MY MOM. AND YOU LEARN YOUR MOM LOVES YOU
289,00:18:26.60,00:18:26.60,NO MATTER WHAT. AND I KNOW THAT ABOUT MY MOM.
290,00:18:29.10,00:18:29.10,I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME IN THIS CONVERSATION IS TO BE
291,00:18:31.57,00:18:31.57,"HONEST. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER,"
292,00:18:33.20,00:18:33.20,"LIKE, YOU DON'T STAND A SHOT. YOU DON'T."
293,00:18:35.20,00:18:35.20,AND I DO. I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
294,00:18:38.43,00:18:38.43,"HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE GUYS, BUT I CAN SEE THEM TAKING"
295,00:18:41.60,00:18:41.60,KATIE FURTHER-- >> I DON'T THINK THEY WILL TAKE

298,00:18:48.27,00:18:48.27,GOING TO BE HONEST TO THE SIX. >> ALL I'M SAYING IS IF IT DOES
299,00:18:51.23,00:18:51.23,"COME DOWN TO SIX, AND YOU'RE NUMBER SIX, YOU HAVE TO GO."
300,00:18:54.90,00:18:54.90,>> WHY? >> BECAUSE YOU DON'T STAND A
301,00:18:56.77,00:18:56.77,CHANCE. NOBODY IS TAKING YOU.
302,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,>> OR I'M GOING TO WIN IMMUNITY. >> AND THEN GIHOME AND YOU'D GO

304,00:19:04.20,00:19:04.20,NONE OF US ARE SITTING IN THE FINAL THREE.

306,00:19:10.00,00:19:10.00,IMMUNITY I'M GONE. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO VOTE MY
307,00:19:12.60,00:19:12.60,MOM OUT. I CAME INTO THIS WANTING TO SIT
308,00:19:15.77,00:19:15.77,AT THE END WITH MY MOM BUT IT JUST WON'T HAPPEN.
309,00:19:18.07,00:19:18.07,"IT'S NOT PRACTICAL. I GET ONE SHOT AT THIS, ONE"
310,00:19:20.67,00:19:20.67,SHOT. AND I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP.
311,00:19:24.97,00:19:24.97,I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC FOR ME AND YOU TO BE
312,00:19:27.47,00:19:27.47,"IN THE FINAL THREE. I FEEL LIKE WE COULD TRY IT, BUT"
313,00:19:30.57,00:19:30.57,I THINK IT'S RISKING EVERYTHING IF WE TRY IT.
314,00:19:33.00,00:19:33.00,DO YOU SEE FOR ME THAT'S FRUSTRATING.
315,00:19:35.37,00:19:35.37,I COULD VOTE YOU OUT FEDERAL AND THEN I COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO
316,00:19:38.33,00:19:38.33,THREE. >> THE AMAZING PART OF WHAT
317,00:19:44.33,00:19:44.33,THIS-- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US OUT HERE ON THE ISLAND IS OUR

320,00:19:53.77,00:19:53.77,THAT. BUT IT'S MORPHING INTO A ROLE
321,00:19:56.10,00:19:56.10,WHERE I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE GIVING ADVICE TO CIERA.
322,00:19:58.73,00:19:58.73,"I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE SAYING, ""THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO."
323,00:20:01.43,00:20:01.43,"HERE IS HOW YOU NEED TO DO IT."" AND SHE WOULD GLADLY COME TO"
324,00:20:05.50,00:20:05.50,ME-- SOMETIMES-- AND TAKE THAT ADVICE.
325,00:20:07.40,00:20:07.40,IT'S NOW MORPHED INTO ROLE WHERE I'M TRUSTING HER DECISIONS.
326,00:20:10.37,00:20:10.37,>> I'M WORRIED THAT I'M GOING TO WAIT AND EXPWAIT IT WILL BE TOO

328,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,BE THE WAY IT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
329,00:20:18.33,00:20:18.33,NOT SAYING GET YOU OUT NOW. I'M SAYING WHAT IF IT GETS TO
330,00:20:23.23,00:20:23.23,"SIR, YOU BEAT ME IN A CHALLENGE AND I GO HOME NAP WOULD SUCK."

335,00:20:38.10,00:20:38.10,HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT TO ME SHOWS THAT SHE HAS GROWN AS A
336,00:20:42.77,00:20:42.77,"WOMAN, THAT SHE'S NO LONGER THIS LITTLE GIRL WHICH ULTIMATELY FOR"
337,00:20:46.57,00:20:46.57,"ME-- MAKES ME PROUD BECAUSE ULTIMATELY FOR ME, I WANTED THIS"

339,00:21:04.07,00:21:04.07,AND TO SIT THERE AND TO SEE HOW STRONG SHE WAS AND TO HEAR HER
340,00:21:08.17,00:21:08.17,"SAY, ""THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, MOM."
341,00:21:10.43,00:21:10.43,YOU'RE KIND OF HINDERING ME ON THIS AND I MIGHT HAVE TO GO OVER

352,00:22:16.67,00:22:16.67,EITHER WINNING THE CHALLENGE OR FINDING THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY

358,00:22:41.47,00:22:41.47,AROUND AND I CAN GET IN A SOILED ALLIANCE AND GO FROM THERE.
359,00:22:44.93,00:22:44.93,>> KATIE HAVING THE THIRD CLUE TO THE IDOL IS A HUGE THREAT.

543,00:34:06.07,00:34:06.07,>> I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE IN MY MIND RIGHT NOW WHERE DO I GO?
544,00:34:09.53,00:34:09.53,">> YOU'RE PLAYING, RIGHT? >> SURE."
545,00:34:11.13,00:34:11.13,">> PICK A ROCK. >> OKAY, SO IF YOU HAVE THE"
546,00:34:14.37,00:34:14.37,BLACK ROCK-- >> LOOK HOW HAPPY CIERA IS.
547,00:34:18.00,00:34:18.00,">> SHE'S LIKE, I GOT IT! I GOT IT!"
548,00:34:21.23,00:34:21.23,">> IT WAS SO PERFECT, WE HAD IT UNTIL WE TOLD CIERA WE WERE"
549,00:34:24.80,00:34:24.80,VOTING HER MOM. THAT WAS THE MISTAKE.
550,00:34:26.90,00:34:26.90,"SKIER ASMARTER THAN WE THOUGHT ORIGINALLY, IS MAKING MOVES AS"
551,00:34:30.57,00:34:30.57,WELL. >> LET'S DO THIS!
552,00:34:31.57,00:34:31.57,>> AND SO IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY BUT IT'S GOT TO BE LAURA.
553,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,BECAUSE LETTING A COUPLE GET FARTHER IN THE GAME IS TOO
554,00:34:39.47,00:34:39.47,DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CAN SWING EVERYTHING WITH JUST ONE VOTE.
555,00:34:42.77,00:34:42.77,"HEY, CIERA WAS TRYING TO SWAY THE VOTES ON TO KATIE, BUT WE"
556,00:34:45.80,00:34:45.80,NEED TO STICK WITH THE PLAN AND DO LAURA.
557,00:34:47.60,00:34:47.60,>> OF COURSE. >> I NEED TO GET THE VOTES BACK
558,00:34:49.60,00:34:49.60,ON LAURA AND GET THEM TO STICK WITH THE PLAN AND VOTE LAURA
559,00:34:52.87,00:34:52.87,OUT. >> WHO ARE WE VOTING FOR?
560,00:34:54.13,00:34:54.13,>> LAURA. >> THE WHOLE TIME I'VE JUST KIND
561,00:35:00.40,00:35:00.40,"OF BEEN LIKE, WHATEVER, WHATEVER, THE THE WHOLE THING."
562,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,BUT I THINK KATIE NEEDS TO GO NEXT.
563,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20,"SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL, AND I THINK IF SHE KIND OF FLOATED ALL"
564,00:35:07.77,00:35:07.77,"THE WAY TO THE END, SHE'S DANGEROUS TO BE SITTING NEXT TO."
565,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,SO I THINK KATIE NEEDS TO GO SOONER THAN LATER.
566,00:35:30.47,00:35:30.47,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
567,00:35:38.57,00:35:38.57,"ARAS. ALL RIGHT, SO, KATIE, LAST"
568,00:35:45.87,00:35:45.87,"TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT WAS YOU OR YOUR MOM."
569,00:35:48.63,00:35:48.63,YOU SURVIVE. YOU GO BACK TO CAMP.
570,00:35:50.63,00:35:50.63,DOES IT STILL FEEL LIKE IT'S GOT TO BE ME NEXT?
571,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,">> YES, ABSOLUTELY, ANDUN, I WAS HOPING AFTER REDEMPTION, EITHER"
572,00:35:57.27,00:35:57.27,MY MOM OR VYTAS MADE IT THROUGH TO GET A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN
573,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,IDOL. I MEAN IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE BUT
574,00:36:03.60,00:36:03.60,"AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING. >> Jeff: SO, CALEB, THIS IS"
575,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,"TRICKY NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS ALLIANCE OF SEVEN, AND YOU HAVE"
576,00:36:11.10,00:36:11.10,"KATIE. BUT IF SHE HAS THE IDOL,"
577,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,SOMEBODY FROM YOUR GROUP GOES HOME AND IT COULD BE YOU.
578,00:36:15.77,00:36:15.77,>> THERE ARE TONS OF MAYBES. MAYBE IT'S STILL OUT THERE.
579,00:36:18.40,00:36:18.40,MAYBE KATIE HAS IT. MAYBE ONE OF US HAS IT.
580,00:36:20.77,00:36:20.77,THERE ARE A BUNCH OF MAYBES. YOU JUST HAVE TO PLAN AHEAD.
581,00:36:24.23,00:36:24.23,">> Jeff: TYSON, NOW THAT TEENA IS GONE, THERE'S ONLY ONE PAIR"
582,00:36:27.30,00:36:27.30,"OF LOVED ONES LEFT, AND THEY ARE BLOOD, MOTHER-DAUGHTER."
583,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,">> YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE"
584,00:36:33.43,00:36:33.43,THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE SIMILAR MIND AND SWING THE SAME WAY.
585,00:36:36.27,00:36:36.27,"I MEAN, SINCE DAY ONE, WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT, AND I"
586,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,DON'T THINK IT'S CHANGED ON DAY 26.
587,00:36:42.20,00:36:42.20,">> Jeff: CALEB, DID YOU SENSE ANY CONCERN FROM LAURA OR CIERA?"
588,00:36:45.57,00:36:45.57,">> YEAH, THERE'S DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN."
589,00:36:48.03,00:36:48.03,BUT YOU LOOK AT CIERA AND LAURA DIFFERENT FROM TINA AND KATIE
590,00:36:53.30,00:36:53.30,BECAUSE LAURA WANTS THIS JUST AS BAD AS CIERA DOES.
591,00:36:57.07,00:36:57.07,SHE'S NOT ABOUT TO LAY DOWN FOR CIERA'S GAME.
592,00:36:59.47,00:36:59.47,SO THEY'RE BOTH-- THEY'RE COMPETITORS.
593,00:37:01.73,00:37:01.73,"THEY'RE BOTH REALLY SMART, AND THEY'VE BOTH GOT AN EQUAL SHOT"
594,00:37:05.33,00:37:05.33,"IN THIS GAME. >> Jeff: HAYDEN, IS CALEB"
595,00:37:10.10,00:37:10.10,SAYING HE'S LESS CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THESE TWO AS A PAIR
596,00:37:13.40,00:37:13.40,BECAUSE LAURA WOULD CUT CIERA'S THROAT AS QUICKLY AS CIERA WOULD
597,00:37:16.90,00:37:16.90,CUT HER MOM'S THROAT. >> THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT.
598,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,"THEY HAVE A COMPETITIVE NATURE. LIKE, ""LAURA, I'M YOUR MOTHER."
599,00:37:24.37,00:37:24.37,I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS WORLD AND I CAN SEND YOU OUT OF IT

603,00:37:39.40,00:37:39.40,HAVE TO DO TO SAY STICK WITH THE PLAN.
604,00:37:42.47,00:37:42.47,GET RID OF KATIE. >> BEFORE IT WAS A LIABILITY TO
605,00:37:44.57,00:37:44.57,HAVE A LOVED ONE. IT'S A HUGE ASSET RIGHT NOW.
606,00:37:47.20,00:37:47.20,"ONE IS TWO. YOU GET ONE OF US, YOU GET TWO"
607,00:37:50.13,00:37:50.13,VOTES. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVEN
608,00:37:51.50,00:37:51.50,PEOPLE LEFT. YOU PICK UP ANOTHER BUDDY AND
609,00:37:54.10,00:37:54.10,WE'RE ON TO FINAL FOUR. >> BUT YOU WANT TO GET TO THE
610,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,"FINAL TWO WITH YOUR LOVED ONE, AND THAT'S ALSO SORT OF A THREAT"
611,00:37:59.27,00:37:59.27,"IN A WAY. I MEAN, I WAS NERVOUS HAVING MY"
612,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,MOM HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT WE WANTED TO GO TO THE
613,00:38:04.63,00:38:04.63,"FINAL TWO TOGETHER, AND SO HAVING YOUR LOVED ONE HERE MAYBE"
614,00:38:07.87,00:38:07.87,ISN'T THE BEST ROUTE ANYWAY. AND--
615,00:38:10.37,00:38:10.37,">> BUT, JEFF, HERE'S OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT."
616,00:38:13.53,00:38:13.53,"IF YOU SEND AT THIS POINT A LOVED ONE HOME, YOU HAVE"
617,00:38:17.43,00:38:17.43,SOMEBODY LOBBYING FOR THOSE JURY VOTES FOR YOUR LOVED ONE.
618,00:38:19.90,00:38:19.90,BUT IF I'M HERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT INFLUENCE ON THE
619,00:38:22.97,00:38:22.97,JURY. >> Jeff: BECAUSE YOU'LL BE
620,00:38:24.37,00:38:24.37,COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER. >> ABSOLUTELY.
621,00:38:25.80,00:38:25.80,AND I THINK WHERE PROBLEMS COME IN ANDS WHEN YOU GET YOUR

623,00:38:31.47,00:38:31.47,AND THE NEXT THINGUN THE TOP THREE ARE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T

629,00:38:48.57,00:38:48.57,">> THAT IS THE BIG DECISION. YOU THINK, WELL, DO WE TAKE OUT"
630,00:38:51.63,00:38:51.63,THE LOVED ONE'S PAIR. DO WE STICK WITH THE PLAN AND
