552,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,BECAUSE LETTING A COUPLE GETFARTHER IN THE GAME IS TOO
553,00:34:39.47,00:34:39.47,DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CAN SWINGEVERYTHING WITH JUST ONE VOTE.
554,00:34:42.77,00:34:42.77,"HEY, CIERA WAS TRYING TO SWAYTHE VOTES ON TO KATIE, BUT WE"

563,00:35:07.77,00:35:07.77,"THE WAY TO THE END, SHE'SDANGEROUS TO BE SITTING NEXT TO."
564,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,SO I THINK KATIE NEEDS TO GOSOONER THAN LATER.
565,00:35:30.47,00:35:30.47,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING INTHE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
