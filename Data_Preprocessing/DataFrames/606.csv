1,00:00:01.17,00:00:01.17,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:02.57,00:00:02.57," With Joanna gone, Deena was the sole leader of Jaburu."
3,00:00:06.10,00:00:06.10,DEENA: I am...
4,00:00:07.40,00:00:07.40,"alpha female, top dog."
5,00:00:09.87,00:00:09.87,PROBST: While a depressed Shawna
6,00:00:11.23,00:00:11.23, still felt trapped by her alliance.
7,00:00:13.67,00:00:13.67,"I'm just...I'm at the lowest of my low,"
8,00:00:15.70,00:00:15.70,and no one is respecting thefact that I am falling apart.
9,00:00:19.33,00:00:19.33,"We're not going to sacrificeourselves for her sake,"
10,00:00:22.67,00:00:22.67, so she might as well buck up and play with the rest of us.
11,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60,PROBST: Treemail told the tribes
12,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03, to send their youngest member on a journey.
13,00:00:30.07,00:00:30.07, So Dave and Jenna spent the evening together
14,00:00:32.40,00:00:32.40, in the jungle learning about each other's tribes.
15,00:00:36.27,00:00:36.27,Who would you have go next?
16,00:00:37.40,00:00:37.40,"Uh, probably Jeanne."
17,00:00:38.83,00:00:38.83,"DAVE: You know, you got to think,"
18,00:00:40.13,00:00:40.13,do you want to berevealing all this?
19,00:00:41.90,00:00:41.90,"PROBST: But in the morning, a twist in the game"
20,00:00:44.03,00:00:44.03,forced them to pick new tribes.
21,00:00:46.00,00:00:46.00,(laughing)
22,00:00:47.70,00:00:47.70," New tribes were chosen, and Butch, Roger and Dave"
23,00:00:51.07,00:00:51.07," welcomed Christy, Heidi and Jeanne."
24,00:00:52.57,00:00:52.57,JEANNE: I felt awesome.
25,00:00:53.73,00:00:53.73," I mean, it was like"
26,00:00:55.07,00:00:55.07,a celebration of a new tribe.
27,00:00:56.70,00:00:56.70,"PROBST: While at Jaburu, Shawna and Jenna were excited"
28,00:00:59.60,00:00:59.60," by the arrival of Rob, Matthew, and Alex."
29,00:01:02.13,00:01:02.13,SHAWNA: Alex is so fun.
30,00:01:04.40,00:01:04.40,I dig him so much.
31,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,PROBST: But Deena was suspicious of Shawna's turnaround.
32,00:01:09.50,00:01:09.50,DEENA: Shawna may not be so interested
33,00:01:11.37,00:01:11.37,in the chick thing anymore.
34,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00,Shawna may be interestedin the Alex thing.
35,00:01:15.50,00:01:15.50, I'm hurting.
36,00:01:16.80,00:01:16.80, -Deena went from top to the bottom. -Go!
37,00:01:19.20,00:01:19.20,PROBST: Jaburu cruised to victory
38,00:01:21.07,00:01:21.07, at the immunity challenge.
39,00:01:22.77,00:01:22.77,Jaburu wins immunity!
40,00:01:24.77,00:01:24.77," And Heidi became the swing vote, forced to choose"
41,00:01:28.03,00:01:28.03, between new friendships and her old tribe mates.
42,00:01:30.83,00:01:30.83,"Like, if you were inmy position,"
43,00:01:31.93,00:01:31.93,what do you think you would do?
44,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,I'd come... I'd come with us.
45,00:01:35.03,00:01:35.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, Heidi sided with the men,"
46,00:01:38.70,00:01:38.70, and Jeanne was voted out of the Amazon.
47,00:01:41.03,00:01:41.03,"Jeanne, the tribe has spoken."
48,00:01:44.63,00:01:44.63, 11 are left.
49,00:01:46.53,00:01:46.53, Who will be voted out tonight?
50,00:03:05.53,00:03:05.53,CHRISTY: I was shocked that Jeannie got voted off.
51,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27,'Cause I personally think she
52,00:03:09.83,00:03:09.83,was one of the strongest membersof the tribe.
53,00:03:12.13,00:03:12.13,"And I was not upset with Heidi,"
54,00:03:15.90,00:03:15.90,but I needed an answer.
55,00:03:17.53,00:03:17.53,"It's very clear, uh,Jeanne brought to this tribe"
56,00:03:22.50,00:03:22.50,"assets that we already have,most of them embodied in Butch."
57,00:03:27.17,00:03:27.17,And you two bringdifferent assets to it:
58,00:03:32.07,00:03:32.07,"your strength, your enthusiasm,your determination."
59,00:03:36.57,00:03:36.57,"DAVE: Christy asked, ""Why was Jeanne picked over me?"""
60,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83, And Roger responded that she had
61,00:03:43.60,00:03:43.60, better qualities for the team itself.
62,00:03:47.13,00:03:47.13,Which seemed very different
63,00:03:50.00,00:03:50.00, than the reasons that we had initially talked about.
64,00:03:52.60,00:03:52.60,ROGER: We have to go forwardas a new team.
65,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93,There's no guaranteethat there
66,00:03:57.30,00:03:57.30,-is going to be a merger.-HEIDI: Right.
67,00:03:59.50,00:03:59.50,And so we better workour asses off.
68,00:04:01.20,00:04:01.20,We... that's exactly it.
69,00:04:03.43,00:04:03.43,DAVE: And the reasons why... why I thought
70,00:04:05.37,00:04:05.37, we voted for Jeanne was because Jeanne
71,00:04:08.00,00:04:08.00,was the next to go from Jaburu.
72,00:04:10.37,00:04:10.37,HEIDI: I just want everybodyto know that...
73,00:04:13.03,00:04:13.03,"the reason I did what I did is,"
74,00:04:15.37,00:04:15.37,you don't come into thisas three on three.
75,00:04:18.97,00:04:18.97,"And I think that if Iwould have said,"
76,00:04:22.20,00:04:22.20,"""Let me just go with the girlsand pick Butch,"""
77,00:04:24.60,00:04:24.60,we would not be able to sit here
78,00:04:26.43,00:04:26.43,and look at each other stillas a team.
79,00:04:28.43,00:04:28.43,"CHRISTY: Sitting therein the Tribal Council,"
80,00:04:29.60,00:04:29.60,"I thought I was the weakest one,"
81,00:04:31.50,00:04:31.50,so I'm... I'm really gladyou see something in me.
82,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,BUTCH: We're glad to have you.We're...
83,00:04:36.13,00:04:36.13,-we are a team.-Yeah.
84,00:04:37.83,00:04:37.83,It is a new day tomorrow.
85,00:04:39.50,00:04:39.50,-BUTCH: That's it.-DAVE: All right.
86,00:04:41.33,00:04:41.33,-Go to bed.-Okay.
87,00:04:57.17,00:04:57.17,"HEIDI: This is a start of a new team,"
88,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60," and I was just, like, full of anticipation,"
89,00:05:02.37,00:05:02.37, expecting to wake up the next morning
90,00:05:04.37,00:05:04.37,"and be, like, this teamworking together as a team."
91,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67,"DAVE: So what's, uh,order of operations today?"
92,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,"ROGER: The three of us,we're going to go out"
93,00:05:12.57,00:05:12.57,"and try this netting business,and..."
94,00:05:15.83,00:05:15.83,and you were going to trythe new latrine.
95,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40,"HEIDI: And instead, it was..."
96,00:05:21.97,00:05:21.97,"me and Christyoff doing one thing,"
97,00:05:24.63,00:05:24.63,and the guys were off fishing.
98,00:05:26.13,00:05:26.13," I was like, ""Okay, did I make the right decision?"""
99,00:05:30.27,00:05:30.27,"This is totally, completelya bunch of crap."
100,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"You know, when you wake upin the morning"
101,00:05:37.30,00:05:37.30,"and... and they just all of asudden go off, it's just, like,"
102,00:05:40.23,00:05:40.23,I don't know if they'rejust not getting it or...
103,00:05:44.27,00:05:44.27,I'm just a little frustratedright now.
104,00:05:46.67,00:05:46.67,(sighs)
105,00:05:58.90,00:05:58.90,MATTHEW: I want you to show me
106,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93, exactly how much toothpaste to use.
107,00:06:02.63,00:06:02.63,I'm going to brush my teeth.
108,00:06:04.10,00:06:04.10,First time in 16 days.
109,00:06:06.30,00:06:06.30,-Isn't that a beautiful thing?-I almost want to eat it.
110,00:06:08.67,00:06:08.67,In fact...
111,00:06:11.53,00:06:11.53,MATTHEW: Coming over here
112,00:06:13.10,00:06:13.10, was just a huge change for the better.
113,00:06:15.37,00:06:15.37, I felt like my head
114,00:06:16.63,00:06:16.63,was on the chopping block
115,00:06:18.27,00:06:18.27,"when I was at Tambaqui,along with, uh, Rob."
116,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,"How does that feel, Rob?"
117,00:06:22.77,00:06:22.77,Indescribably good?
118,00:06:24.20,00:06:24.20,Does anybody want to make outwith me right now?
119,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,'Cause this is probably...
120,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,ALEX:I-I will after I brush my teeth.
121,00:06:30.47,00:06:30.47,ROB: I brushed my teeth today like I was detailing my car.
122,00:06:34.37,00:06:34.37, My mouth feels so good.
123,00:06:35.97,00:06:35.97," I want one of the girls to kiss me,"
124,00:06:38.27,00:06:38.27,"but none of them want to do it,"
125,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,which is surprising.
126,00:06:42.53,00:06:42.53,This is awesome.
127,00:06:44.03,00:06:44.03,"This is, like, the best thingthat's happened in 16 days."
128,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,DEENA: Brand-new tribe-- I was
129,00:06:49.57,00:06:49.57,"unbelievably rattled, uh,when the new people came over."
130,00:06:54.37,00:06:54.37,"I thought,"
131,00:06:55.37,00:06:55.37," ""Man, I'm clearly an easy target."""
132,00:06:57.47,00:06:57.47, I'm the oldest.
133,00:06:59.10,00:06:59.10, I have very little in common with the rest of them.
134,00:07:01.97,00:07:01.97," And, uh, it took me a... a moment to readjust."
135,00:07:05.07,00:07:05.07,But the guys are fascinating.
136,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,I just absolutely adore them.
137,00:07:08.57,00:07:08.57,I felt like a lot of the otherpeople on the other tribe
138,00:07:11.00,00:07:11.00,"definitely were, you know,very tactical and strategic"
139,00:07:14.97,00:07:14.97,about the type of informationthey released.
140,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,"But coming here,it's just like..."
141,00:07:18.80,00:07:18.80,"man, it was, like,a breath of fresh air."
142,00:07:21.00,00:07:21.00,-DEENA: Because girls aredifferent than boys. -Yeah.
143,00:07:23.53,00:07:23.53,MATTHEW: Everyone in the group seems to be really genuine.
144,00:07:26.80,00:07:26.80,"Appearances can alwaysbe deceiving,"
145,00:07:28.97,00:07:28.97,"but at least on the surface,it's..."
146,00:07:31.43,00:07:31.43,"it's quite comfortable,the atmosphere."
147,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,"ALEX: I mean, I did comeout here to compete,"
148,00:07:37.60,00:07:37.60,"but it's also, like,I love the adventure,"
149,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,"and I love meeting you guys,"
150,00:07:42.33,00:07:42.33,and those are the thingsthat make this great.
151,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,"I'm getting all mushy, but..."
152,00:07:46.07,00:07:46.07,"JENNA: Feel like we're ata drive-in movie,"
153,00:07:48.33,00:07:48.33,"and I'm...you guys are, like, the couple,"
154,00:07:50.13,00:07:50.13,"and I'm like, ""Hey, guys,can I tag along?"""
155,00:07:52.40,00:07:52.40,"ALEX: At Jaburu, is there romance in the air? Maybe."
156,00:07:56.13,00:07:56.13,There's definite interestin the air.
157,00:07:57.93,00:07:57.93,There's definiteflirting in the air.
158,00:08:00.77,00:08:00.77,I don't know. I'm a huge flirt.
159,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23," I love to flirt, especially with someone"
160,00:08:03.87,00:08:03.87," who's a big flirt also and, like..."
161,00:08:05.40,00:08:05.40,I don't know. It's great.
162,00:08:06.53,00:08:06.53,It feels good.It feels good to flirt.
163,00:08:08.20,00:08:08.20,"Okay, you know, Shawna,I'm never"
164,00:08:09.40,00:08:09.40,"going to stop you,so if you're done,"
165,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,"you can... you can stopwhenever you want,"
166,00:08:13.43,00:08:13.43,but I'm not going to evertell you to stop. (chuckles)
167,00:08:16.67,00:08:16.67,"SHAWNA: Alex and I, I think,"
168,00:08:18.57,00:08:18.57," enjoy taking care of each other out here,"
169,00:08:20.20,00:08:20.20," and whether it evolves into anything,"
170,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20, the two of us instantly clicked.
171,00:08:24.63,00:08:24.63,I definitely wantto get to know him better.
172,00:08:26.57,00:08:26.57,"Like, he isan incredible person."
173,00:08:28.43,00:08:28.43, He's seen me at some
174,00:08:30.03,00:08:30.03," of my worst moments already, and it's day,"
175,00:08:32.80,00:08:32.80,"you know, whatever."
176,00:08:34.20,00:08:34.20,"I mean, that's kind of...that's revealing."
177,00:08:40.20,00:08:40.20,DEENA: I think that wecan all safely assume
178,00:08:42.63,00:08:42.63,that we have... are goingto graduate from Coke to food.
179,00:08:45.77,00:08:45.77,"ROB: Yeah.Oh, what's this?"
180,00:08:47.47,00:08:47.47,"DEENA:Oh, let's see."
181,00:08:49.40,00:08:49.40,"""Looks like your dinnersare tasting pretty bland."
182,00:08:51.67,00:08:51.67,"""Keep your focusand your balance,"
183,00:08:54.17,00:08:54.17,"and give your mealsa helping hand."""
184,00:08:56.10,00:08:56.10,"-All right, ""balance"" means...-Spices?"
185,00:08:57.50,00:08:57.50,-Yes.-Salt and pepper?
186,00:08:58.93,00:08:58.93,Mm-hmm.
187,00:09:00.27,00:09:00.27,"ROB: Deena and I went to go get the treemail,"
188,00:09:03.00,00:09:03.00," and we were hoping that it would be some sort of meal,"
189,00:09:05.67,00:09:05.67, but you never know
190,00:09:07.00,00:09:07.00,what a reward challengetruly will be
191,00:09:09.27,00:09:09.27,and what added bonusthere might be with it.
192,00:09:22.37,00:09:22.37,"PROBST: Jaburu, getting yourfirst look at the new Tambaqui."
193,00:09:24.93,00:09:24.93,Jeanne voted outat the last Tribal Council.
194,00:09:27.73,00:09:27.73,"Today's challenge is for reward,"
195,00:09:30.47,00:09:30.47,and it will requirea little bit of strength
196,00:09:32.47,00:09:32.47,and a whole lot of coordination.
197,00:09:33.73,00:09:33.73,It's very simple.
198,00:09:35.07,00:09:35.07,In front of you isa revolving log over a mud pit.
199,00:09:38.57,00:09:38.57,"One-on-one, you will square offagainst another member"
200,00:09:40.93,00:09:40.93,of the same sexfrom the other tribe.

405,00:18:34.30,00:18:34.30,I needed herto go down like that.
406,00:18:36.00,00:18:36.00,"BUTCH: Tell you what, our girlsdidn't back down, did they?"
407,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,"CHRISTY: Like, I remember whenyou were standing up there,"
408,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,"and I'm thinking, like,""He's believing in himself."
409,00:18:42.37,00:18:42.37,"He's believing in himself,""you know,"
410,00:18:43.90,00:18:43.90,"and there you go,you totally got him."
411,00:18:45.40,00:18:45.40,I was ready to grab those boards
412,00:18:46.60,00:18:46.60,and hang on with my fingersand just roll
413,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,all the way around and have itcome right around again.
414,00:18:51.73,00:18:51.73,-I'm just proud of us.-CHRISTY: Yeah.
415,00:18:53.00,00:18:53.00,"I mean, it's hard as a new team,"
416,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,"you know, to really cometogether in what, two days?"
417,00:18:57.43,00:18:57.43,And I really feellike we pulled it off
418,00:18:59.47,00:18:59.47,"as a team,not, like, as individuals."
419,00:19:02.30,00:19:02.30,"BUTCH: You know, I-I'd liketo share something."
420,00:19:04.03,00:19:04.03,"I'd like to share somethingwith you guys,"
421,00:19:05.87,00:19:05.87,and this is coming from stuffthat I've seen through
422,00:19:08.97,00:19:08.97,almost 30 years of coaching andbeing around kids.
423,00:19:11.77,00:19:11.77,"In my lifetime,there is defining moments"
424,00:19:14.03,00:19:14.03,"when I remember certain details,"
425,00:19:15.97,00:19:15.97,and there's only about fivein my life--
426,00:19:18.10,00:19:18.10,six in my life--that I can remember.
427,00:19:19.77,00:19:19.77,"Well, yesterday and today,"
428,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,"I have another one,and that was last night"
429,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40,when Christy realizedthat we kept her for her talent
430,00:19:28.13,00:19:28.13,and for her ability.
431,00:19:29.53,00:19:29.53,The smile that came acrossher face was unbelievable.
432,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"And then, today, when sheclimbed out of that water,"
433,00:19:36.43,00:19:36.43,-I thought her... she was gonnajump out of her skin. -Aw...
434,00:19:38.97,00:19:38.97,And I thought she was justgoing to go... but she had...
435,00:19:41.77,00:19:41.77,and-and she knewthat-that her... your value.
436,00:19:43.70,00:19:43.70,"You knew that you're one of us,you knew your importance,"
437,00:19:45.70,00:19:45.70,and you'll never forget thatas long as you live.
438,00:19:47.50,00:19:47.50,I'll never forget it.
439,00:19:48.90,00:19:48.90,"That's... that is on my listas a defining moment,"
440,00:19:51.83,00:19:51.83,and I mean thatfrom the bottom of my heart.
441,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,You don't have a disability.That's how I feel about it.
442,00:19:56.07,00:19:56.07,-Thanks. Thanks.-All right?
443,00:19:57.70,00:19:57.70,CHRISTY: Hearing him say that
444,00:19:59.33,00:19:59.33,"is like, ""Yes, yes."""
445,00:20:01.00,00:20:01.00,"I mean, I strivethrough my whole life"
446,00:20:03.63,00:20:03.63,to just try to prove thatto people
447,00:20:05.87,00:20:05.87,or show people that there'snothing wrong with me.
448,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,"Yay, I finally..."
449,00:20:10.93,00:20:10.93,-Thank you. That's cool.-Okay. I mean it.
450,00:20:13.23,00:20:13.23,"I mean it, okay?Yeah, I'm real proud of you."
451,00:20:15.07,00:20:15.07,"-Thanks, Butch.-You're welcome."
452,00:20:30.90,00:20:30.90,"DEENA: Oh, it's nice and cool today."
453,00:20:32.50,00:20:32.50,ROB: You got it all the way in?
454,00:20:34.17,00:20:34.17,"Oh, heck, yeah."
455,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,Nicely soaked.Want some?
456,00:20:37.20,00:20:37.20,"Oh, sure."
457,00:20:38.73,00:20:38.73,"ROB: Coming into this new tribe, I had an alliance with Alex,"
458,00:20:42.87,00:20:42.87,but I've been noticing in Alexthat he's losing his momentum.
459,00:20:47.37,00:20:47.37, He's not as interested in playing the game
460,00:20:49.47,00:20:49.47," as he is making friends, which is stupid"
461,00:20:51.47,00:20:51.47, 'cause he could have stayed home
462,00:20:52.83,00:20:52.83, and made a bunch of friends.
463,00:20:54.10,00:20:54.10," So, as a partner in an alliance,"
464,00:20:56.63,00:20:56.63, that's not what I'm looking for.
465,00:20:58.33,00:20:58.33,And then I met Deena.
466,00:21:00.17,00:21:00.17,"DEENA: Okay, so, like,what's our plan here?"
467,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,-For what?-You don't know?
468,00:21:04.13,00:21:04.13,-Strategy?-Yeah.
469,00:21:05.67,00:21:05.67,I have to tell you-- 'cause I...I have Jenna and Heidi.
470,00:21:08.10,00:21:08.10,"Oh, definitely."
471,00:21:09.23,00:21:09.23,I'd hate... I'd hateto vote out Alex
472,00:21:10.63,00:21:10.63,"just like you'd hateto vote out Shawna,"
473,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,but we have to dowhat we have to do.
474,00:21:14.33,00:21:14.33,But your friends--you've known them for 16 days.
475,00:21:17.70,00:21:17.70,Exactly.
476,00:21:19.57,00:21:19.57,"ROB: Deena is as hungry as I am,"
477,00:21:21.93,00:21:21.93,and she's the kind of personthat nobody would suspect
478,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50,I would have anythingin common with.
479,00:21:26.57,00:21:26.57,You mind beingwith a bunch of chicks?
480,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,I... could do worse.
481,00:21:29.87,00:21:29.87,'Cause my strategyfrom the beginning
482,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,"was, once the part with the guyswas going to... was-was over,"
483,00:21:34.53,00:21:34.53,-I was going to turn on theguys. -Yeah.
484,00:21:36.77,00:21:36.77,Because I knew I wasn't partof their final three.
485,00:21:38.93,00:21:38.93,"DEENA: Rob approached me,"
486,00:21:40.33,00:21:40.33,"and he said,""Listen, I need some help."""
487,00:21:44.67,00:21:44.67,"And I said,""Listen, I need some help."""
488,00:21:47.20,00:21:47.20,I would like to get ridof Matthew.
489,00:21:49.23,00:21:49.23,"He's... he annoys me to death,"
490,00:21:50.87,00:21:50.87,but I'm just going to haveto suck it up and get over it
491,00:21:54.13,00:21:54.13,'cause we're going to need himfor a while.
492,00:21:56.23,00:21:56.23,"ROB: After my conversation with Deeny,"
493,00:21:58.43,00:21:58.43,"I realized that, number one,Matthew does catch a lot of fish"
494,00:22:02.30,00:22:02.30," and that we were going to need his vote, so I have come"
495,00:22:07.03,00:22:07.03,to an understanding that weprobably will need Matthew.
496,00:22:11.90,00:22:11.90,"Okay, let's say we losethe immunity challenge."
497,00:22:15.07,00:22:15.07,"-Right.-Which... which, you know,"
498,00:22:16.63,00:22:16.63,"I would like to avoidat all costs,"
499,00:22:18.60,00:22:18.60,"but then, if we go to a merge..."
500,00:22:20.37,00:22:20.37,"-Right. -...then we go backto Roger, Butch and Dave"
501,00:22:24.97,00:22:24.97,and tell them that we've stayedwith them all along.
502,00:22:27.67,00:22:27.67,-Right. -And that allthe guys are sticking together.
503,00:22:29.77,00:22:29.77,"-Right. -And that we're goingto go after one of the girls,"
504,00:22:32.43,00:22:32.43,-but...-Basically divert their votes.
505,00:22:34.07,00:22:34.07,"Yes, we divert their votes,"
506,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,and then we goafter Dave or Roger.
507,00:22:38.37,00:22:38.37,I think that'd be great.
508,00:22:40.27,00:22:40.27,"MATTHEW: Rob and I went fishing alone for the first time,"
509,00:22:44.10,00:22:44.10, and it was really nice because I realized at Tambaqui that
510,00:22:47.77,00:22:47.77,"he chose to maintainhis distance,"
511,00:22:50.53,00:22:50.53,"uh, out of insecurity."
512,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93, Seemed like a real genuine offer
513,00:22:55.37,00:22:55.37, to build a better relationship
514,00:22:57.23,00:22:57.23,and help one another throughoutthe remainder of the game.
515,00:23:00.93,00:23:00.93,You don't think there'sanything shifty underway.
516,00:23:02.93,00:23:02.93,-No. -There haven't been...you haven't had any...
517,00:23:04.93,00:23:04.93,had any sidebar conversationswith anyone?
518,00:23:06.57,00:23:06.57,"No, there's noth...there's nothing shifty going on."
519,00:23:08.20,00:23:08.20,-Right. -It's going to be...everybody's being
520,00:23:10.13,00:23:10.13,"-pretty genuine.-I like Shawna, though."
521,00:23:11.40,00:23:11.40,"I definitely think that there's,you know..."
522,00:23:13.40,00:23:13.40,"I mean, it's not...I'm not, like, you know,"
523,00:23:15.10,00:23:15.10,"-scoping for affection,that's for sure. -Yeah."
524,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,ROB: Matthew has no idea that he's being played by myself.
525,00:23:21.13,00:23:21.13,The guy is a complete idiotand has no concept
526,00:23:24.10,00:23:24.10,of what's going onin this game around him.
527,00:23:28.10,00:23:28.10,-Got it?-Yeah.
528,00:23:29.70,00:23:29.70,Nice.
529,00:23:31.17,00:23:31.17,"Dude, here they come."
530,00:23:33.53,00:23:33.53,ROB: I don't know
531,00:23:34.70,00:23:34.70,if Matthew believesthat he is a threat.
532,00:23:37.07,00:23:37.07,DEENA:Holy crapola.
533,00:23:38.63,00:23:38.63,"Oh, yeah. Ooh!"
534,00:23:42.00,00:23:42.00,I know for a fact that he'sa physical threat in this game.
535,00:23:46.90,00:23:46.90," As long as he keeps catching fish, we'll keep him around,"
536,00:23:49.93,00:23:49.93, but as soon as he stops catching fish
537,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37," or stops doing what we tell him to,"
538,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,he's out.
539,00:24:14.90,00:24:14.90,"JENNA:Well, like, if you were to sweep"
540,00:24:16.00,00:24:16.00,"a girl off her feet,what would you do?"
541,00:24:17.60,00:24:17.60,-What would I do? Dependson the girl. -Let's do this.
542,00:24:20.03,00:24:20.03,"You guys both take Shawna out,sweep her off her feet."
543,00:24:22.10,00:24:22.10,-Me... I'm taking Shawna out?-And sweep me off my feet.
544,00:24:23.90,00:24:23.90,"-Al-Alex and me are both takingShawna out? -No, one at a time."
545,00:24:26.23,00:24:26.23,"I want to hear Mateoon this one, too."
546,00:24:28.13,00:24:28.13,"-JENNA: Yeah, I do... -Mateo,we're playing ""The Dating Game."""
547,00:24:29.83,00:24:29.83,"-You have to date me.-Oh, cool."
548,00:24:31.63,00:24:31.63,"SHAWNA: At nighttime, it gets dark really early,"
549,00:24:33.93,00:24:33.93,and you got to make your own fun
550,00:24:35.20,00:24:35.20,if you're goingto stay alive out here.
551,00:24:36.57,00:24:36.57,"So tonight's ""The Dating Game."""
552,00:24:38.17,00:24:38.17, And I had to decide-- I was critiquing dates
553,00:24:40.80,00:24:40.80, and figuring out what I wanted to do.
554,00:24:42.40,00:24:42.40,DEENA:Who's going first?
555,00:24:43.70,00:24:43.70,-I'll go first.-Okay.
556,00:24:45.03,00:24:45.03,Start the dateprobably late morning.
557,00:24:48.70,00:24:48.70,Shawna's already made it clearthat she likes to shop.
558,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,Really going out on a limb--girls like to shop.
559,00:24:52.60,00:24:52.60,Then we'd have to go climbing.
560,00:24:55.30,00:24:55.30,"Picnic lunch after climbing,and, um..."
561,00:24:58.27,00:24:58.27,(laughs)you've got to have
562,00:24:59.90,00:24:59.90,-the E.L. Fudge cookiesfor dessert. -Yeah.
563,00:25:02.70,00:25:02.70,"SHAWNA: It was funny,'cause every single one of them"
564,00:25:04.70,00:25:04.70, knows me in a different light.
565,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47," Every person has different sides they bring out in you,"
566,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83, so it was kind of cool to see
567,00:25:09.23,00:25:09.23,the different versionsthey came up with
568,00:25:11.47,00:25:11.47,of who they thoughtI ideally would want.
569,00:25:14.77,00:25:14.77,-Nicely done.-Bachelor number two.
570,00:25:16.30,00:25:16.30,I'd say Shawna has arrivedthe night before.
571,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,"She's, uh, well rested."
572,00:25:21.17,00:25:21.17,"I've rented a,uh, chauffeur-driven limo."
573,00:25:24.27,00:25:24.27,We get to the top of a...of a beautiful hill
574,00:25:28.17,00:25:28.17,"with a...like, a magnificent view."
575,00:25:30.30,00:25:30.30,An unparalleled view.
576,00:25:32.30,00:25:32.30,"MATTHEW: I was definitely at a loss, because D.C."
577,00:25:35.07,00:25:35.07," does not have, uh, as many cool places to go"
578,00:25:37.80,00:25:37.80, or things to do as New York City or L.A.
579,00:25:42.07,00:25:42.07,But I do thinkthat it's an opportunity
580,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,"to kind of, uh, build somethingwith Shawna because, uh,"
581,00:25:47.03,00:25:47.03, there's definitely potential there.
582,00:25:49.27,00:25:49.27,"-JENNA: Rob.-It's you, Rob."
583,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,"It's a Wednesday afternoon,"
584,00:25:53.60,00:25:53.60,and it's Christmastimein New York.
585,00:25:55.40,00:25:55.40,-Aw.-Very cool.
586,00:25:57.33,00:25:57.33,"-Good touch.-Yeah, very good."
587,00:25:59.93,00:25:59.93,The thingabout Wednesday afternoons
588,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,"is that there's alwaysa matinee on Broadway,"
589,00:26:04.50,00:26:04.50,and we've got theater tickets.
590,00:26:06.30,00:26:06.30,And we're going to go downto Rockefeller Center.
591,00:26:08.33,00:26:08.33,"-Oh, yeah. -And we're goingto go ice-skating."
592,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,-Mm-hmm.-Yes!
593,00:26:11.90,00:26:11.90,-Good call.-ROB: In the plaza.
594,00:26:13.07,00:26:13.07,Well done.
595,00:26:14.37,00:26:14.37,"SHAWNA: Physically, I'm still really weak,"
596,00:26:15.73,00:26:15.73, but my mind has definitely taken over my body.
597,00:26:17.57,00:26:17.57," I-I got this great, new, positive outlook with the guys"
598,00:26:21.27,00:26:21.27, that saved me from the women.
599,00:26:23.20,00:26:23.20, I just wasn't having fun.
600,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67," I just... I need that presence in my life,"
601,00:26:27.77,00:26:27.77, and... and they're just great guys.
602,00:26:29.90,00:26:29.90, They make me laugh.
603,00:26:30.90,00:26:30.90,"SHAWNA:Rob, it's you."
604,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"That was the most incredibledate, ever."

608,00:26:55.50,00:26:55.50,Will you back-scratchwhile I sleep?
609,00:26:57.63,00:26:57.63,Is that what you're getting?
610,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,Might as well be.
611,00:27:01.50,00:27:01.50,"ALEX: As Shawna and I have become a little closer,"
612,00:27:04.20,00:27:04.20, Matt starts trying to bring
613,00:27:05.57,00:27:05.57,the focus back aroundto his romantic situations.
614,00:27:10.33,00:27:10.33, And when Shawna and I
615,00:27:11.50,00:27:11.50, were kind of cuddled up sleeping
616,00:27:12.93,00:27:12.93," and Matt started to use her as a pillow,"
617,00:27:15.40,00:27:15.40, I think that Matt might be feeling a little left out.
618,00:27:19.57,00:27:19.57,DEENA: Shawna all of a sudden has this miraculous recovery
619,00:27:22.13,00:27:22.13," now that the boys enter the camp,"
620,00:27:23.60,00:27:23.60, but she has essentially done
621,00:27:24.93,00:27:24.93, very little since day three.
622,00:27:26.90,00:27:26.90,Shawna isn't working Mattas much as Alex.
623,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,Shawna's still flirtatiouswith Matt.
624,00:27:33.23,00:27:33.23, But anybody who gets together exclusively
625,00:27:35.57,00:27:35.57, against all others poses a threat to me.
626,00:27:45.23,00:27:45.23,BUTCH:Think we got anything?

799,00:35:06.97,00:35:06.97,My vote's probablygoing to Matt.
800,00:35:09.60,00:35:09.60,"And I don't want to do it,but I'm not getting rid of Alex."
801,00:35:13.80,00:35:13.80,He's helpedpull me through this.
802,00:35:17.03,00:35:17.03,ROB: I really thought that this meeting was going to go
803,00:35:20.03,00:35:20.03," that Shawna was going to say, ""Guys, you can vote me out,"""
804,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00, and then everybody was going to start to get emotional.
805,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87," Now Alex is saying he's going to vote for Matt,"
806,00:35:28.53,00:35:28.53, just because he won't vote for Shawna.
807,00:35:31.47,00:35:31.47," And Shawna says she's going to vote for Matt,"
808,00:35:33.37,00:35:33.37," so now Matt has two votes out of six, so"
809,00:35:35.97,00:35:35.97, this is really going to...  could go either way.
810,00:35:37.63,00:35:37.63,Either Mattor Shawna could get the boot.
811,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00," Now, up until the other day, I was very excited"
812,00:35:42.43,00:35:42.43," about the prospect of getting rid of Matt,"
813,00:35:44.47,00:35:44.47, but I've been putting a lot of energy
814,00:35:45.47,00:35:45.47, into talking to this guy--
815,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03, which is absolutely exhausting--
816,00:35:48.60,00:35:48.60, trying to get him on my side.
817,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,And now that I got the guyeating out
818,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,"of the palm of my hand,we're going to vote him off."
819,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,It sucks that the people
820,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,that I want to go areall on the other tribe.
821,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,(Shawna laughs)
822,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,(thunder rumbling)
823,00:36:32.23,00:36:32.23,Got a weird vibe tonight.
824,00:36:33.67,00:36:33.67,Is it sad tonight already?
825,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,"Yeah, you guys definitely have alook that I haven't seen before."
826,00:36:40.80,00:36:40.80,"Shawna, what's going on?"
827,00:36:42.73,00:36:42.73,"Well, I don't think anyone wantsto be here right now."
828,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,And we were so jazzed. The lastthing we want to do right now--
829,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,we had such a phenomenalchemistry between the six
830,00:36:52.77,00:36:52.77,of us-- and no one wants to seeanyone go.
831,00:36:56.10,00:36:56.10,But... we're here.
832,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,"And so, it's a total bummer."
833,00:36:59.60,00:36:59.60,"PROBST:Alex, anybody that you think,"
834,00:37:01.73,00:37:01.73,"""I almost wishI had met you back home,"
835,00:37:03.23,00:37:03.23,"""because this experienceis so weird that"
836,00:37:06.27,00:37:06.27,"it might make it hardto pursue anything?"""
837,00:37:08.30,00:37:08.30,"Yeah, totally."
838,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,"If I met Shawna not here,"
839,00:37:12.00,00:37:12.00,"yeah, totally, I'd be...I'd be all about,"
840,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,"like, asking her out and hangingout with her. She's awesome."
841,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"PROBST:Deena, you're noticing this..."
842,00:37:18.77,00:37:18.77,"yeah, something's happening."
843,00:37:20.27,00:37:20.27,"Oh, yeah, there's some...there's some sexual heat there."
844,00:37:22.57,00:37:22.57,(laughter)
845,00:37:24.80,00:37:24.80,"No, it's been a lot of fun,and I-I do call it"
846,00:37:27.27,00:37:27.27,"the love shack, because, youknow, we all are right there."
847,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,"Um, there's a lot of positiveenergy that's being provided,"
848,00:37:33.03,00:37:33.03,"uh, when we talk aboutone another's lives, and"
849,00:37:35.80,00:37:35.80,it-it's really beena lot of fun.
850,00:37:37.90,00:37:37.90,"Now, within the love shack,"
851,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,"you still have to stay dry,you still have to eat."
852,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,"Matthew, let's talk aboutwhat's happening with roles."
853,00:37:46.27,00:37:46.27,"I relish the roleof, uh, provider, because"
854,00:37:51.47,00:37:51.47,"I think thatwe as a group need to eat well,"
855,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,and eating 12 fishfor dinner really is a...
856,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,is a great thing.
857,00:38:01.73,00:38:01.73,"Rob, what's your role?You're always good for a laugh."
858,00:38:04.40,00:38:04.40,Is that your role?
859,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,I like to tryto keep the tribe entertained.
860,00:38:08.23,00:38:08.23,I feel like anytimethat we're bored
861,00:38:10.70,00:38:10.70,"or just sitting arounddoing nothing,"
862,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,"that our energy levelis just sinking,"
863,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,"so I'm always tryingto think of a bunch of games,"
864,00:38:16.23,00:38:16.23,"or stupid songs to sing,or, you know, any sort of thing"
865,00:38:19.47,00:38:19.47,"that we could just havea group discussion about,"
866,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"'cause I feel likeit really helps,"
867,00:38:22.50,00:38:22.50,"not only to break the ice,"
868,00:38:23.93,00:38:23.93,but also just to keepeverybody's energy level up.
869,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,"-And it's really fun. -PROBST:How about for you, Shawna?"
870,00:38:28.47,00:38:28.47,I know you've had some up daysand some down days
871,00:38:30.97,00:38:30.97,in these first 18 days.
872,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,-How are you feeling now?-I'm doing awesome.
873,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27,I've gone from probablyone of my darkest hours
874,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,ever as a person--
875,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,"just completely in the dumps,just wanted out,"
876,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,"but... and then,all of a sudden, as soon as"
877,00:38:45.23,00:38:45.23,we get this infusion of energy
878,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,"from the guys,and the dynamics change,"
879,00:38:48.97,00:38:48.97,"and all of a sudden,the games picked up, and"
880,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,"it feels like it's a game,and it's fun..."
881,00:38:53.23,00:38:53.23,"you just.. all of a sudden,"
882,00:38:54.57,00:38:54.57,"I went to the most,like, ultimate high."
883,00:38:56.03,00:38:56.03,I'm glowing these days.
884,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03,"So, give it to me. You arein this for the long haul then?"
885,00:39:00.90,00:39:00.90,-Are you here? -Of courseI'm in it for the long haul.
886,00:39:03.07,00:39:03.07,"No, I'm...You know, like, what I needed"
887,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,"was someone to take my head outof my butt, and they did it."
888,00:39:09.13,00:39:09.13,"Deena, is this a hard votefor you,"
889,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"or because you're not partof this young group,"
890,00:39:13.23,00:39:13.23,"are you ableto just step back and say,"
891,00:39:15.07,00:39:15.07,"""At leastI don't have that headache""?"
892,00:39:17.10,00:39:17.10,"Fortunately, I can say thatI am part of this young group."
893,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,I would say that this was...
894,00:39:21.37,00:39:21.37,is the absolute most difficultvote that we have had to date.
895,00:39:25.30,00:39:25.30,"Difficult or not,it is time to vote."
896,00:39:28.47,00:39:28.47,"Jenna, you're up."
897,00:39:54.53,00:39:54.53,"I think you're oneof the nicest people I ever met,"
898,00:39:58.23,00:39:58.23,and you putwhat's good for others
899,00:40:00.27,00:40:00.27,before what's good for you.
900,00:40:02.77,00:40:02.77,"Unfortunately,"
901,00:40:04.30,00:40:04.30,that also makes you a reallyterrible Survivor player.
902,00:40:28.03,00:40:28.03,"Matt, I'm voting for you,because later on down the line,"
903,00:40:31.33,00:40:31.33,"you may be a threat,and, uh, I don't know."
904,00:40:35.23,00:40:35.23,We'll see what happens.
905,00:40:50.07,00:40:50.07,I'll go tally the votes.
906,00:41:01.97,00:41:01.97,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
907,00:41:03.97,00:41:03.97,The person voted outwill be asked
908,00:41:05.57,00:41:05.57,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
909,00:41:07.20,00:41:07.20,I'll read the votes.
910,00:41:10.23,00:41:10.23,First vote--
911,00:41:13.03,00:41:13.03,Shawna.
912,00:41:18.30,00:41:18.30,Matt.
913,00:41:20.43,00:41:20.43,"One vote-- Shawna,one vote-- Matt."
914,00:41:25.30,00:41:25.30,Shawna.
915,00:41:26.60,00:41:26.60,Two votes-- Shawna.
916,00:41:30.63,00:41:30.63,Two votes-- Matt.
917,00:41:33.57,00:41:33.57,"We're tied. Two votes-- Shawna,two votes-- Matt."
918,00:41:40.90,00:41:40.90,That's three votes-- Shawna.
919,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,Last vote.
920,00:41:47.93,00:41:47.93,Sixth person voted

923,00:41:52.20,00:41:52.20,You need to bring me your torch.
924,00:42:06.03,00:42:06.03,"Shawna, the tribe has spoken."
925,00:42:22.57,00:42:22.57,"Well, this is certainly"
926,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,a rollercoasterof highs and lows.
927,00:42:26.87,00:42:26.87,"And this tribehas already had its fair share,"
928,00:42:29.33,00:42:29.33,including tough decisionslike you had to make tonight.
929,00:42:32.27,00:42:32.27,We're only 18 days in.
930,00:42:33.93,00:42:33.93,"Got to keep your head, because"
931,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,there is a lot morestill to come.
932,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,"Grab your torches,head back to camp."
933,00:42:39.13,00:42:39.13,Good night.

944,00:43:22.77,00:43:22.77,I went through so muchin this brief amount of time.
945,00:43:25.37,00:43:25.37,I don't think I've ever hada bigger crash course in life.
946,00:43:28.43,00:43:28.43," At age 24, I never thought"
947,00:43:30.03,00:43:30.03, I'd be so touched by an experience.
948,00:43:32.30,00:43:32.30," My trip may have ended here,"
