1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.17,00:00:01.17,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.57,00:00:02.57," With Joanna gone, Deena  was the sole leader of Jaburu."
4,00:00:06.10,00:00:06.10,DEENA:  I am...
5,00:00:07.40,00:00:07.40,"alpha female, top dog."
6,00:00:09.87,00:00:09.87,PROBST:  While a depressed Shawna
7,00:00:11.23,00:00:11.23, still felt trapped  by her alliance.
8,00:00:13.67,00:00:13.67,"I'm just... I'm at the lowest of my low,"
9,00:00:15.70,00:00:15.70,and no one is respecting the fact that I am falling apart.
10,00:00:19.33,00:00:19.33,"We're not going to sacrifice ourselves for her sake,"
11,00:00:22.67,00:00:22.67, so she might as well buck up  and play with the rest of us.
12,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60,PROBST:  Treemail told the tribes
13,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03, to send their youngest member  on a journey.
14,00:00:30.07,00:00:30.07, So Dave and Jenna  spent the evening together
15,00:00:32.40,00:00:32.40, in the jungle learning  about each other's tribes.
16,00:00:36.27,00:00:36.27,Who would you have go next?
17,00:00:37.40,00:00:37.40,"Uh, probably Jeanne."
18,00:00:38.83,00:00:38.83,"DAVE:  You know, you got to think,"
19,00:00:40.13,00:00:40.13,do you want to be revealing all this?
20,00:00:41.90,00:00:41.90,"PROBST: But in the morning,  a twist in the game"
21,00:00:44.03,00:00:44.03,forced them to pick new tribes.
22,00:00:46.00,00:00:46.00,(laughing)
23,00:00:47.70,00:00:47.70," New tribes were chosen,  and Butch, Roger and Dave"
24,00:00:51.07,00:00:51.07," welcomed Christy,  Heidi and Jeanne."
25,00:00:52.57,00:00:52.57,JEANNE:  I felt awesome.
26,00:00:53.73,00:00:53.73," I mean, it was like"
27,00:00:55.07,00:00:55.07,a celebration of a new tribe.
28,00:00:56.70,00:00:56.70,"PROBST: While at Jaburu,  Shawna and Jenna were excited"
29,00:00:59.60,00:00:59.60," by the arrival of Rob,  Matthew, and Alex."
30,00:01:02.13,00:01:02.13,SHAWNA:  Alex is so fun.
31,00:01:04.40,00:01:04.40,I dig him so much.
32,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,PROBST: But Deena was suspicious  of Shawna's turnaround.
33,00:01:09.50,00:01:09.50,DEENA: Shawna may not be  so interested
34,00:01:11.37,00:01:11.37,in the chick thing anymore.
35,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00,Shawna may be interested in the Alex thing.
36,00:01:15.50,00:01:15.50, I'm hurting.
37,00:01:16.80,00:01:16.80, -Deena went from top  to the bottom. -Go!
38,00:01:19.20,00:01:19.20,PROBST:  Jaburu cruised to victory
39,00:01:21.07,00:01:21.07, at the immunity challenge.
40,00:01:22.77,00:01:22.77,Jaburu wins immunity!
41,00:01:24.77,00:01:24.77," And Heidi became the  swing vote, forced to choose"
42,00:01:28.03,00:01:28.03, between new friendships  and her old tribe mates.
43,00:01:30.83,00:01:30.83,"Like, if you were in my position,"
44,00:01:31.93,00:01:31.93,what do you think you would do?
45,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,I'd come... I'd come with us.
46,00:01:35.03,00:01:35.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  Heidi sided with the men,"
47,00:01:38.70,00:01:38.70, and Jeanne was voted  out of the Amazon.
48,00:01:41.03,00:01:41.03,"Jeanne, the tribe has spoken."
49,00:01:44.63,00:01:44.63, 11 are left.
50,00:01:46.53,00:01:46.53, Who will be voted out tonight?
51,00:03:05.53,00:03:05.53,CHRISTY: I was shocked  that Jeannie got voted off.
52,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27,'Cause I personally think she
53,00:03:09.83,00:03:09.83,was one of the strongest members of the tribe.
54,00:03:12.13,00:03:12.13,"And I was not upset with Heidi,"
55,00:03:15.90,00:03:15.90,but I needed an answer.
56,00:03:17.53,00:03:17.53,"It's very clear, uh, Jeanne brought to this tribe"
57,00:03:22.50,00:03:22.50,"assets that we already have, most of them embodied in Butch."
58,00:03:27.17,00:03:27.17,And you two bring different assets to it:
59,00:03:32.07,00:03:32.07,"your strength, your enthusiasm, your determination."
60,00:03:36.57,00:03:36.57,"DAVE: Christy asked, ""Why  was Jeanne picked over me?"""
61,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83, And Roger responded  that she had
62,00:03:43.60,00:03:43.60, better qualities  for the team itself.
63,00:03:47.13,00:03:47.13,Which seemed very different
64,00:03:50.00,00:03:50.00, than the reasons that we  had initially talked about.
65,00:03:52.60,00:03:52.60,ROGER: We have to go forward as a new team.
66,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93,There's no guarantee that there
67,00:03:57.30,00:03:57.30,-is going to be a merger. -HEIDI: Right.
68,00:03:59.50,00:03:59.50,And so we better work our asses off.
69,00:04:01.20,00:04:01.20,We... that's exactly it.
70,00:04:03.43,00:04:03.43,DAVE: And the reasons  why... why I thought
71,00:04:05.37,00:04:05.37, we voted for Jeanne  was because Jeanne
72,00:04:08.00,00:04:08.00,was the next to go from Jaburu.
73,00:04:10.37,00:04:10.37,HEIDI: I just want everybody to know that...
74,00:04:13.03,00:04:13.03,"the reason I did what I did is,"
75,00:04:15.37,00:04:15.37,you don't come into this as three on three.
76,00:04:18.97,00:04:18.97,"And I think that if I would have said,"
77,00:04:22.20,00:04:22.20,"""Let me just go with the girls and pick Butch,"""
78,00:04:24.60,00:04:24.60,we would not be able to sit here
79,00:04:26.43,00:04:26.43,and look at each other still as a team.
80,00:04:28.43,00:04:28.43,"CHRISTY: Sitting there in the Tribal Council,"
81,00:04:29.60,00:04:29.60,"I thought I was the weakest one,"
82,00:04:31.50,00:04:31.50,so I'm... I'm really glad you see something in me.
83,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,BUTCH: We're glad to have you. We're...
84,00:04:36.13,00:04:36.13,-we are a team. -Yeah.
85,00:04:37.83,00:04:37.83,It is a new day tomorrow.
86,00:04:39.50,00:04:39.50,-BUTCH: That's it. -DAVE: All right.
87,00:04:41.33,00:04:41.33,-Go to bed. -Okay.
88,00:04:57.17,00:04:57.17,"HEIDI:  This is a start of a new team,"
89,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60," and I was just, like,  full of anticipation,"
90,00:05:02.37,00:05:02.37, expecting to wake up  the next morning
91,00:05:04.37,00:05:04.37,"and be, like, this team working together as a team."
92,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67,"DAVE: So what's, uh, order of operations today?"
93,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,"ROGER: The three of us, we're going to go out"
94,00:05:12.57,00:05:12.57,"and try this netting business, and..."
95,00:05:15.83,00:05:15.83,and you were going to try the new latrine.
96,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40,"HEIDI:  And instead, it was..."
97,00:05:21.97,00:05:21.97,"me and Christy off doing one thing,"
98,00:05:24.63,00:05:24.63,and the guys were off fishing.
99,00:05:26.13,00:05:26.13," I was like, ""Okay, did I make  the right decision?"""
100,00:05:30.27,00:05:30.27,"This is totally, completely a bunch of crap."
101,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"You know, when you wake up in the morning"
102,00:05:37.30,00:05:37.30,"and... and they just all of a sudden go off, it's just, like,"
103,00:05:40.23,00:05:40.23,I don't know if they're just not getting it or...
104,00:05:44.27,00:05:44.27,I'm just a little frustrated right now.
105,00:05:46.67,00:05:46.67,(sighs)
106,00:05:58.90,00:05:58.90,MATTHEW:  I want you to show me
107,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93, exactly how much toothpaste  to use.
108,00:06:02.63,00:06:02.63,I'm going to brush my teeth.
109,00:06:04.10,00:06:04.10,First time in 16 days.
110,00:06:06.30,00:06:06.30,-Isn't that a beautiful thing? -I almost want to eat it.
111,00:06:08.67,00:06:08.67,In fact...
112,00:06:11.53,00:06:11.53,MATTHEW:  Coming over here
113,00:06:13.10,00:06:13.10, was just a huge change  for the better.
114,00:06:15.37,00:06:15.37, I felt like my head
115,00:06:16.63,00:06:16.63,was on the chopping block
116,00:06:18.27,00:06:18.27,"when I was at Tambaqui, along with, uh, Rob."
117,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,"How does that feel, Rob?"
118,00:06:22.77,00:06:22.77,Indescribably good?
119,00:06:24.20,00:06:24.20,Does anybody want to make out with me right now?
120,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,'Cause this is probably...
121,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,ALEX: I-I will after I brush my teeth.
122,00:06:30.47,00:06:30.47,ROB: I brushed my teeth today  like I was detailing my car.
123,00:06:34.37,00:06:34.37, My mouth feels so good.
124,00:06:35.97,00:06:35.97," I want one of the girls  to kiss me,"
125,00:06:38.27,00:06:38.27,"but none of them want to do it,"
126,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,which is surprising.
127,00:06:42.53,00:06:42.53,This is awesome.
128,00:06:44.03,00:06:44.03,"This is, like, the best thing that's happened in 16 days."
129,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,DEENA:  Brand-new tribe-- I was
130,00:06:49.57,00:06:49.57,"unbelievably rattled, uh, when the new people came over."
131,00:06:54.37,00:06:54.37,"I thought,"
132,00:06:55.37,00:06:55.37," ""Man, I'm clearly  an easy target."""
133,00:06:57.47,00:06:57.47, I'm the oldest.
134,00:06:59.10,00:06:59.10, I have very little in common  with the rest of them.
135,00:07:01.97,00:07:01.97," And, uh, it took me a...  a moment to readjust."
136,00:07:05.07,00:07:05.07,But the guys are fascinating.
137,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,I just absolutely adore them.
138,00:07:08.57,00:07:08.57,I felt like a lot of the other people on the other tribe
139,00:07:11.00,00:07:11.00,"definitely were, you know, very tactical and strategic"
140,00:07:14.97,00:07:14.97,about the type of information they released.
141,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,"But coming here, it's just like..."
142,00:07:18.80,00:07:18.80,"man, it was, like, a breath of fresh air."
143,00:07:21.00,00:07:21.00,-DEENA: Because girls are different than boys. -Yeah.
144,00:07:23.53,00:07:23.53,MATTHEW: Everyone in the group  seems to be really genuine.
145,00:07:26.80,00:07:26.80,"Appearances can always be deceiving,"
146,00:07:28.97,00:07:28.97,"but at least on the surface, it's..."
147,00:07:31.43,00:07:31.43,"it's quite comfortable, the atmosphere."
148,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,"ALEX: I mean, I did come out here to compete,"
149,00:07:37.60,00:07:37.60,"but it's also, like, I love the adventure,"
150,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,"and I love meeting you guys,"
151,00:07:42.33,00:07:42.33,and those are the things that make this great.
152,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,"I'm getting all mushy, but..."
153,00:07:46.07,00:07:46.07,"JENNA: Feel like we're at a drive-in movie,"
154,00:07:48.33,00:07:48.33,"and I'm... you guys are, like, the couple,"
155,00:07:50.13,00:07:50.13,"and I'm like, ""Hey, guys, can I tag along?"""
156,00:07:52.40,00:07:52.40,"ALEX: At Jaburu, is there  romance in the air? Maybe."
157,00:07:56.13,00:07:56.13,There's definite interest in the air.
158,00:07:57.93,00:07:57.93,There's definite flirting in the air.
159,00:08:00.77,00:08:00.77,I don't know. I'm a huge flirt.
160,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23," I love to flirt,  especially with someone"
161,00:08:03.87,00:08:03.87," who's a big flirt also  and, like..."
162,00:08:05.40,00:08:05.40,I don't know. It's great.
163,00:08:06.53,00:08:06.53,It feels good. It feels good to flirt.
164,00:08:08.20,00:08:08.20,"Okay, you know, Shawna, I'm never"
165,00:08:09.40,00:08:09.40,"going to stop you, so if you're done,"
166,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,"you can... you can stop whenever you want,"
167,00:08:13.43,00:08:13.43,but I'm not going to ever tell you to stop. (chuckles)
168,00:08:16.67,00:08:16.67,"SHAWNA:  Alex and I, I think,"
169,00:08:18.57,00:08:18.57," enjoy taking care  of each other out here,"
170,00:08:20.20,00:08:20.20," and whether it evolves  into anything,"
171,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20, the two of us  instantly clicked.
172,00:08:24.63,00:08:24.63,I definitely want to get to know him better.
173,00:08:26.57,00:08:26.57,"Like, he is an incredible person."
174,00:08:28.43,00:08:28.43, He's seen me at some
175,00:08:30.03,00:08:30.03," of my worst moments already,  and it's day,"
176,00:08:32.80,00:08:32.80,"you know, whatever."
177,00:08:34.20,00:08:34.20,"I mean, that's kind of... that's revealing."
178,00:08:40.20,00:08:40.20,DEENA: I think that we can all safely assume
179,00:08:42.63,00:08:42.63,that we have... are going to graduate from Coke to food.
180,00:08:45.77,00:08:45.77,"ROB: Yeah. Oh, what's this?"
181,00:08:47.47,00:08:47.47,"DEENA: Oh, let's see."
182,00:08:49.40,00:08:49.40,"""Looks like your dinners are tasting pretty bland."
183,00:08:51.67,00:08:51.67,"""Keep your focus and your balance,"
184,00:08:54.17,00:08:54.17,"and give your meals a helping hand."""
185,00:08:56.10,00:08:56.10,"-All right, ""balance"" means... -Spices?"
186,00:08:57.50,00:08:57.50,-Yes. -Salt and pepper?
187,00:08:58.93,00:08:58.93,Mm-hmm.
188,00:09:00.27,00:09:00.27,"ROB: Deena and I went  to go get the treemail,"
189,00:09:03.00,00:09:03.00," and we were hoping that it  would be some sort of meal,"
190,00:09:05.67,00:09:05.67, but you never know
191,00:09:07.00,00:09:07.00,what a reward challenge truly will be
192,00:09:09.27,00:09:09.27,and what added bonus there might be with it.
193,00:09:22.37,00:09:22.37,"PROBST: Jaburu, getting your first look at the new Tambaqui."
194,00:09:24.93,00:09:24.93,Jeanne voted out at the last Tribal Council.
195,00:09:27.73,00:09:27.73,"Today's challenge is for reward,"
196,00:09:30.47,00:09:30.47,and it will require a little bit of strength
197,00:09:32.47,00:09:32.47,and a whole lot of coordination.
198,00:09:33.73,00:09:33.73,It's very simple.
199,00:09:35.07,00:09:35.07,In front of you is a revolving log over a mud pit.

362,00:16:44.47,00:16:44.47, with the loofah  and with the brush.

383,00:17:34.83,00:17:34.83,I don't know. We should have done this a while ago--
384,00:17:37.10,00:17:37.10,even the day we got here.
385,00:17:38.47,00:17:38.47,DEENA: Was there stuff  going on? You bet.

403,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,"""Yay, I'm competing against Jenna."""
404,00:18:31.03,00:18:31.03,"I was, like, ""I'm getting that girl down."""
405,00:18:32.77,00:18:32.77,But she went down.
406,00:18:34.30,00:18:34.30,I needed her to go down like that.
407,00:18:36.00,00:18:36.00,"BUTCH: Tell you what, our girls didn't back down, did they?"
408,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,"CHRISTY: Like, I remember when you were standing up there,"
409,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,"and I'm thinking, like, ""He's believing in himself."
410,00:18:42.37,00:18:42.37,"He's believing in himself,"" you know,"
411,00:18:43.90,00:18:43.90,"and there you go, you totally got him."
412,00:18:45.40,00:18:45.40,I was ready to grab those boards
413,00:18:46.60,00:18:46.60,and hang on with my fingers and just roll
414,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,all the way around and have it come right around again.
415,00:18:51.73,00:18:51.73,-I'm just proud of us. -CHRISTY: Yeah.
416,00:18:53.00,00:18:53.00,"I mean, it's hard as a new team,"
417,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,"you know, to really come together in what, two days?"
418,00:18:57.43,00:18:57.43,And I really feel like we pulled it off
419,00:18:59.47,00:18:59.47,"as a team, not, like, as individuals."
420,00:19:02.30,00:19:02.30,"BUTCH: You know, I-I'd like to share something."
421,00:19:04.03,00:19:04.03,"I'd like to share something with you guys,"
422,00:19:05.87,00:19:05.87,and this is coming from stuff that I've seen through
423,00:19:08.97,00:19:08.97,almost 30 years of coaching and being around kids.
424,00:19:11.77,00:19:11.77,"In my lifetime, there is defining moments"
425,00:19:14.03,00:19:14.03,"when I remember certain details,"
426,00:19:15.97,00:19:15.97,and there's only about five in my life--
427,00:19:18.10,00:19:18.10,six in my life-- that I can remember.
428,00:19:19.77,00:19:19.77,"Well, yesterday and today,"
429,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,"I have another one, and that was last night"
430,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40,when Christy realized that we kept her for her talent
431,00:19:28.13,00:19:28.13,and for her ability.
432,00:19:29.53,00:19:29.53,The smile that came across her face was unbelievable.
433,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"And then, today, when she climbed out of that water,"
434,00:19:36.43,00:19:36.43,-I thought her... she was gonna jump out of her skin. -Aw...
435,00:19:38.97,00:19:38.97,And I thought she was just going to go... but she had...
436,00:19:41.77,00:19:41.77,and-and she knew that-that her... your value.
437,00:19:43.70,00:19:43.70,"You knew that you're one of us, you knew your importance,"
438,00:19:45.70,00:19:45.70,and you'll never forget that as long as you live.
439,00:19:47.50,00:19:47.50,I'll never forget it.
440,00:19:48.90,00:19:48.90,"That's... that is on my list as a defining moment,"
441,00:19:51.83,00:19:51.83,and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
442,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,You don't have a disability. That's how I feel about it.
443,00:19:56.07,00:19:56.07,-Thanks. Thanks. -All right?
444,00:19:57.70,00:19:57.70,CHRISTY:  Hearing him say that
445,00:19:59.33,00:19:59.33,"is like, ""Yes, yes."""
446,00:20:01.00,00:20:01.00,"I mean, I strive through my whole life"
447,00:20:03.63,00:20:03.63,to just try to prove that to people
448,00:20:05.87,00:20:05.87,or show people that there's nothing wrong with me.
449,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,"Yay, I finally..."
450,00:20:10.93,00:20:10.93,-Thank you. That's cool. -Okay. I mean it.
451,00:20:13.23,00:20:13.23,"I mean it, okay? Yeah, I'm real proud of you."
452,00:20:15.07,00:20:15.07,"-Thanks, Butch. -You're welcome."
453,00:20:30.90,00:20:30.90,"DEENA:  Oh, it's nice and cool today."
454,00:20:32.50,00:20:32.50,ROB:  You got it all the way in?
455,00:20:34.17,00:20:34.17,"Oh, heck, yeah."
456,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,Nicely soaked. Want some?
457,00:20:37.20,00:20:37.20,"Oh, sure."
458,00:20:38.73,00:20:38.73,"ROB: Coming into this new tribe,  I had an alliance with Alex,"
459,00:20:42.87,00:20:42.87,but I've been noticing in Alex that he's losing his momentum.
460,00:20:47.37,00:20:47.37, He's not as interested  in playing the game
461,00:20:49.47,00:20:49.47," as he is making friends,  which is stupid"
462,00:20:51.47,00:20:51.47, 'cause he could have  stayed home
463,00:20:52.83,00:20:52.83, and made a bunch of friends.
464,00:20:54.10,00:20:54.10," So, as a partner  in an alliance,"
465,00:20:56.63,00:20:56.63, that's not what  I'm looking for.
466,00:20:58.33,00:20:58.33,And then I met Deena.
467,00:21:00.17,00:21:00.17,"DEENA: Okay, so, like, what's our plan here?"
468,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,-For what? -You don't know?
469,00:21:04.13,00:21:04.13,-Strategy? -Yeah.
470,00:21:05.67,00:21:05.67,I have to tell you-- 'cause I... I have Jenna and Heidi.
471,00:21:08.10,00:21:08.10,"Oh, definitely."
472,00:21:09.23,00:21:09.23,I'd hate... I'd hate to vote out Alex
473,00:21:10.63,00:21:10.63,"just like you'd hate to vote out Shawna,"
474,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,but we have to do what we have to do.
475,00:21:14.33,00:21:14.33,But your friends-- you've known them for 16 days.
476,00:21:17.70,00:21:17.70,Exactly.
477,00:21:19.57,00:21:19.57,"ROB:  Deena is as hungry as I am,"
478,00:21:21.93,00:21:21.93,and she's the kind of person that nobody would suspect
479,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50,I would have anything in common with.
480,00:21:26.57,00:21:26.57,You mind being with a bunch of chicks?
481,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,I... could do worse.
482,00:21:29.87,00:21:29.87,'Cause my strategy from the beginning
483,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,"was, once the part with the guys was going to... was-was over,"
484,00:21:34.53,00:21:34.53,-I was going to turn on the guys. -Yeah.
485,00:21:36.77,00:21:36.77,Because I knew I wasn't part of their final three.
486,00:21:38.93,00:21:38.93,"DEENA:  Rob approached me,"
487,00:21:40.33,00:21:40.33,"and he said, ""Listen, I need some help."""
488,00:21:44.67,00:21:44.67,"And I said, ""Listen, I need some help."""
489,00:21:47.20,00:21:47.20,I would like to get rid of Matthew.
490,00:21:49.23,00:21:49.23,"He's... he annoys me to death,"
491,00:21:50.87,00:21:50.87,but I'm just going to have to suck it up and get over it
492,00:21:54.13,00:21:54.13,'cause we're going to need him for a while.
493,00:21:56.23,00:21:56.23,"ROB: After my conversation  with Deeny,"
494,00:21:58.43,00:21:58.43,"I realized that, number one, Matthew does catch a lot of fish"
495,00:22:02.30,00:22:02.30," and that we were going to need  his vote, so I have come"
496,00:22:07.03,00:22:07.03,to an understanding that we probably will need Matthew.
497,00:22:11.90,00:22:11.90,"Okay, let's say we lose the immunity challenge."
498,00:22:15.07,00:22:15.07,"-Right. -Which... which, you know,"
499,00:22:16.63,00:22:16.63,"I would like to avoid at all costs,"
500,00:22:18.60,00:22:18.60,"but then, if we go to a merge..."
501,00:22:20.37,00:22:20.37,"-Right. -...then we go back to Roger, Butch and Dave"
502,00:22:24.97,00:22:24.97,and tell them that we've stayed with them all along.
503,00:22:27.67,00:22:27.67,-Right. -And that all the guys are sticking together.
504,00:22:29.77,00:22:29.77,"-Right. -And that we're going to go after one of the girls,"
505,00:22:32.43,00:22:32.43,-but... -Basically divert their votes.
506,00:22:34.07,00:22:34.07,"Yes, we divert their votes,"
507,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,and then we go after Dave or Roger.
508,00:22:38.37,00:22:38.37,I think that'd be great.
509,00:22:40.27,00:22:40.27,"MATTHEW: Rob and I went fishing  alone for the first time,"
510,00:22:44.10,00:22:44.10, and it was really nice because  I realized at Tambaqui that
511,00:22:47.77,00:22:47.77,"he chose to maintain his distance,"
512,00:22:50.53,00:22:50.53,"uh, out of insecurity."
513,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93, Seemed like  a real genuine offer
514,00:22:55.37,00:22:55.37, to build a better relationship
515,00:22:57.23,00:22:57.23,and help one another throughout the remainder of the game.
516,00:23:00.93,00:23:00.93,You don't think there's anything shifty underway.
517,00:23:02.93,00:23:02.93,-No. -There haven't been... you haven't had any...
518,00:23:04.93,00:23:04.93,had any sidebar conversations with anyone?
519,00:23:06.57,00:23:06.57,"No, there's noth... there's nothing shifty going on."
520,00:23:08.20,00:23:08.20,-Right. -It's going to be... everybody's being
521,00:23:10.13,00:23:10.13,"-pretty genuine. -I like Shawna, though."
522,00:23:11.40,00:23:11.40,"I definitely think that there's, you know..."
523,00:23:13.40,00:23:13.40,"I mean, it's not... I'm not, like, you know,"
524,00:23:15.10,00:23:15.10,"-scoping for affection, that's for sure. -Yeah."
525,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,ROB: Matthew has no idea that  he's being played by myself.
526,00:23:21.13,00:23:21.13,The guy is a complete idiot and has no concept
527,00:23:24.10,00:23:24.10,of what's going on in this game around him.
528,00:23:28.10,00:23:28.10,-Got it? -Yeah.
529,00:23:29.70,00:23:29.70,Nice.
530,00:23:31.17,00:23:31.17,"Dude, here they come."
531,00:23:33.53,00:23:33.53,ROB:  I don't know
532,00:23:34.70,00:23:34.70,if Matthew believes that he is a threat.
533,00:23:37.07,00:23:37.07,DEENA: Holy crapola.
534,00:23:38.63,00:23:38.63,"Oh, yeah. Ooh!"
535,00:23:42.00,00:23:42.00,I know for a fact that he's a physical threat in this game.
536,00:23:46.90,00:23:46.90," As long as he keeps catching  fish, we'll keep him around,"
537,00:23:49.93,00:23:49.93, but as soon as he stops  catching fish
538,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37," or stops doing  what we tell him to,"
539,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,he's out.
540,00:24:14.90,00:24:14.90,"JENNA: Well, like, if you were to sweep"
541,00:24:16.00,00:24:16.00,"a girl off her feet, what would you do?"
542,00:24:17.60,00:24:17.60,-What would I do? Depends on the girl. -Let's do this.
543,00:24:20.03,00:24:20.03,"You guys both take Shawna out, sweep her off her feet."
544,00:24:22.10,00:24:22.10,-Me... I'm taking Shawna out? -And sweep me off my feet.
545,00:24:23.90,00:24:23.90,"-Al-Alex and me are both taking Shawna out? -No, one at a time."
546,00:24:26.23,00:24:26.23,"I want to hear Mateo on this one, too."
547,00:24:28.13,00:24:28.13,"-JENNA: Yeah, I do... -Mateo, we're playing ""The Dating Game."""
548,00:24:29.83,00:24:29.83,"-You have to date me. -Oh, cool."
549,00:24:31.63,00:24:31.63,"SHAWNA: At nighttime,  it gets dark really early,"
550,00:24:33.93,00:24:33.93,and you got to make your own fun
551,00:24:35.20,00:24:35.20,if you're going to stay alive out here.
552,00:24:36.57,00:24:36.57,"So tonight's ""The Dating Game."""
553,00:24:38.17,00:24:38.17, And I had to decide--  I was critiquing dates
554,00:24:40.80,00:24:40.80, and figuring out  what I wanted to do.
555,00:24:42.40,00:24:42.40,DEENA: Who's going first?
556,00:24:43.70,00:24:43.70,-I'll go first. -Okay.
557,00:24:45.03,00:24:45.03,Start the date probably late morning.
558,00:24:48.70,00:24:48.70,Shawna's already made it clear that she likes to shop.
559,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,Really going out on a limb-- girls like to shop.
560,00:24:52.60,00:24:52.60,Then we'd have to go climbing.
561,00:24:55.30,00:24:55.30,"Picnic lunch after climbing, and, um..."
562,00:24:58.27,00:24:58.27,(laughs) you've got to have
563,00:24:59.90,00:24:59.90,-the E.L. Fudge cookies for dessert. -Yeah.
564,00:25:02.70,00:25:02.70,"SHAWNA: It was funny, 'cause every single one of them"
565,00:25:04.70,00:25:04.70, knows me in a different light.
566,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47," Every person has different  sides they bring out in you,"
567,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83, so it was kind of cool to see
568,00:25:09.23,00:25:09.23,the different versions they came up with
569,00:25:11.47,00:25:11.47,of who they thought I ideally would want.
570,00:25:14.77,00:25:14.77,-Nicely done. -Bachelor number two.
571,00:25:16.30,00:25:16.30,I'd say Shawna has arrived the night before.
572,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,"She's, uh, well rested."
573,00:25:21.17,00:25:21.17,"I've rented a, uh, chauffeur-driven limo."
574,00:25:24.27,00:25:24.27,We get to the top of a... of a beautiful hill
575,00:25:28.17,00:25:28.17,"with a... like, a magnificent view."
576,00:25:30.30,00:25:30.30,An unparalleled view.
577,00:25:32.30,00:25:32.30,"MATTHEW: I was definitely  at a loss, because D.C."
578,00:25:35.07,00:25:35.07," does not have, uh,  as many cool places to go"
579,00:25:37.80,00:25:37.80, or things to do  as New York City or L.A.
580,00:25:42.07,00:25:42.07,But I do think that it's an opportunity
581,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,"to kind of, uh, build something with Shawna because, uh,"
582,00:25:47.03,00:25:47.03, there's definitely  potential there.
583,00:25:49.27,00:25:49.27,"-JENNA: Rob. -It's you, Rob."
584,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,"It's a Wednesday afternoon,"
585,00:25:53.60,00:25:53.60,and it's Christmastime in New York.
586,00:25:55.40,00:25:55.40,-Aw. -Very cool.
587,00:25:57.33,00:25:57.33,"-Good touch. -Yeah, very good."
588,00:25:59.93,00:25:59.93,The thing about Wednesday afternoons
589,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,"is that there's always a matinee on Broadway,"
590,00:26:04.50,00:26:04.50,and we've got theater tickets.
591,00:26:06.30,00:26:06.30,And we're going to go down to Rockefeller Center.
592,00:26:08.33,00:26:08.33,"-Oh, yeah. -And we're going to go ice-skating."
593,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,-Mm-hmm. -Yes!
594,00:26:11.90,00:26:11.90,-Good call. -ROB: In the plaza.
595,00:26:13.07,00:26:13.07,Well done.
596,00:26:14.37,00:26:14.37,"SHAWNA: Physically,  I'm still really weak,"
597,00:26:15.73,00:26:15.73, but my mind has definitely  taken over my body.
598,00:26:17.57,00:26:17.57," I-I got this great, new,  positive outlook with the guys"
599,00:26:21.27,00:26:21.27, that saved me from the women.
600,00:26:23.20,00:26:23.20, I just wasn't having fun.
601,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67," I just... I need  that presence in my life,"
602,00:26:27.77,00:26:27.77, and... and they're just  great guys.
603,00:26:29.90,00:26:29.90, They make me laugh.
604,00:26:30.90,00:26:30.90,"SHAWNA: Rob, it's you."
605,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"That was the most incredible date, ever."
606,00:26:34.30,00:26:34.30,-What? I won? -You won!
607,00:26:51.07,00:26:51.07,Oh.
608,00:26:54.07,00:26:54.07,"MATTHEW: Oh, that feels good."
609,00:26:55.50,00:26:55.50,Will you back-scratch while I sleep?
610,00:26:57.63,00:26:57.63,Is that what you're getting?
611,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,Might as well be.
612,00:27:01.50,00:27:01.50,"ALEX: As Shawna and I  have become a little closer,"
613,00:27:04.20,00:27:04.20, Matt starts trying to bring
614,00:27:05.57,00:27:05.57,the focus back around to his romantic situations.
615,00:27:10.33,00:27:10.33, And when Shawna and I
616,00:27:11.50,00:27:11.50, were kind of cuddled up  sleeping
617,00:27:12.93,00:27:12.93," and Matt started  to use her as a pillow,"
618,00:27:15.40,00:27:15.40, I think that Matt might be  feeling a little left out.
619,00:27:19.57,00:27:19.57,DEENA: Shawna all of a sudden  has this miraculous recovery
620,00:27:22.13,00:27:22.13," now that the boys  enter the camp,"
621,00:27:23.60,00:27:23.60, but she has essentially done
622,00:27:24.93,00:27:24.93, very little since day three.
623,00:27:26.90,00:27:26.90,Shawna isn't working Matt as much as Alex.
624,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,Shawna's still flirtatious with Matt.
625,00:27:33.23,00:27:33.23, But anybody who gets together  exclusively
626,00:27:35.57,00:27:35.57, against all others  poses a threat to me.
627,00:27:45.23,00:27:45.23,BUTCH: Think we got anything?
628,00:27:47.63,00:27:47.63,What do you think?
629,00:27:48.87,00:27:48.87,Okay.
630,00:27:50.97,00:27:50.97,Oh.
631,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,I don't want to meet the dog this goes to.
632,00:28:01.63,00:28:01.63,BUTCH: We got mail!
633,00:28:02.87,00:28:02.87,DAVE: Yeah!
634,00:28:04.80,00:28:04.80,ROGER: What does it say?

642,00:28:22.30,00:28:22.30,"-I'm thinking that's right. -That's possible, too."
643,00:28:24.03,00:28:24.03,"I think that's right, guys."
644,00:28:25.27,00:28:25.27,"Christy, is that good for you or bad for you?"
645,00:28:27.03,00:28:27.03,"-I think I can do it. -No, no, no. No, no, no, no."

653,00:28:52.07,00:28:52.07,is going to be a Survivor frenzy.
654,00:28:54.33,00:28:54.33,It's not a lot different from what happens
655,00:28:56.73,00:28:56.73,when you get a group
656,00:28:58.00,00:28:58.00," of piranha and they get  a fresh piece of meat,"
657,00:29:00.30,00:29:00.30, and they just begin  to attack that meat.
658,00:29:02.53,00:29:02.53,You're going to participate as a tribe.
659,00:29:04.10,00:29:04.10," You each have a piece of beef,  weighs the same amount."

661,00:29:09.33,00:29:09.33,you're going to tear off
662,00:29:10.63,00:29:10.63,as much of that meat as you can in ten minutes.
663,00:29:13.37,00:29:13.37,"Whichever tribe has the most meat in their basket,"
664,00:29:15.93,00:29:15.93,"measured by weight, wins immunity."

666,00:29:21.70,00:29:21.70,Can't sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges.

776,00:34:13.43,00:34:13.43,and I don't want to go.
777,00:34:14.87,00:34:14.87,SHAWNA: I have to agree with Deena. I already told you guys.

789,00:34:45.37,00:34:45.37,"And Matt, I-I... I hope you don't take this"

793,00:34:53.77,00:34:53.77,"for the same reason, trade votes with you."
794,00:34:56.47,00:34:56.47,"JENNA:   I don't know where to fall,"
795,00:34:57.87,00:34:57.87," because I don't want  to vote for Shawna,"
796,00:34:59.37,00:34:59.37, 'cause I do feel close  to her right now.
797,00:35:01.47,00:35:01.47,"I-I like her company, and"
798,00:35:03.97,00:35:03.97," between her and Matt,"
799,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20, I like her company  more than Matt's company.
800,00:35:06.97,00:35:06.97,My vote's probably going to Matt.
801,00:35:09.60,00:35:09.60,"And I don't want to do it, but I'm not getting rid of Alex."
802,00:35:13.80,00:35:13.80,He's helped pull me through this.
803,00:35:17.03,00:35:17.03,ROB: I really thought that this  meeting was going to go
804,00:35:20.03,00:35:20.03," that Shawna was going to say,  ""Guys, you can vote me out,"""
805,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00, and then everybody was going  to start to get emotional.
806,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87," Now Alex is saying he's going  to vote for Matt,"
807,00:35:28.53,00:35:28.53, just because  he won't vote for Shawna.
808,00:35:31.47,00:35:31.47," And Shawna says  she's going to vote for Matt,"
809,00:35:33.37,00:35:33.37," so now Matt has two votes out  of six, so"
810,00:35:35.97,00:35:35.97, this is really going to...  could go either way.
811,00:35:37.63,00:35:37.63,Either Matt or Shawna could get the boot.
812,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00," Now, up until the other day,  I was very excited"
813,00:35:42.43,00:35:42.43," about the prospect  of getting rid of Matt,"
814,00:35:44.47,00:35:44.47, but I've been putting  a lot of energy
815,00:35:45.47,00:35:45.47, into talking to this guy--
816,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03, which is  absolutely exhausting--
817,00:35:48.60,00:35:48.60, trying to get him on my side.
818,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,And now that I got the guy eating out
819,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,"of the palm of my hand, we're going to vote him off."
820,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,It sucks that the people
821,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,that I want to go are all on the other tribe.
822,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,(Shawna laughs)
823,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,(thunder rumbling)
824,00:36:32.23,00:36:32.23,Got a weird vibe tonight.
825,00:36:33.67,00:36:33.67,Is it sad tonight already?
826,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,"Yeah, you guys definitely have a look that I haven't seen before."
827,00:36:40.80,00:36:40.80,"Shawna, what's going on?"
828,00:36:42.73,00:36:42.73,"Well, I don't think anyone wants to be here right now."
829,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,And we were so jazzed. The last thing we want to do right now--
830,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,we had such a phenomenal chemistry between the six
831,00:36:52.77,00:36:52.77,of us-- and no one wants to see anyone go.
832,00:36:56.10,00:36:56.10,But... we're here.
833,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,"And so, it's a total bummer."
834,00:36:59.60,00:36:59.60,"PROBST: Alex, anybody that you think,"
835,00:37:01.73,00:37:01.73,"""I almost wish I had met you back home,"
836,00:37:03.23,00:37:03.23,"""because this experience is so weird that"
837,00:37:06.27,00:37:06.27,"it might make it hard to pursue anything?"""
838,00:37:08.30,00:37:08.30,"Yeah, totally."
839,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,"If I met Shawna not here,"
840,00:37:12.00,00:37:12.00,"yeah, totally, I'd be... I'd be all about,"
841,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,"like, asking her out and hanging out with her. She's awesome."
842,00:37:17.27,00:37:17.27,"PROBST: Deena, you're noticing this..."
843,00:37:18.77,00:37:18.77,"yeah, something's happening."
844,00:37:20.27,00:37:20.27,"Oh, yeah, there's some... there's some sexual heat there."
845,00:37:22.57,00:37:22.57,(laughter)
846,00:37:24.80,00:37:24.80,"No, it's been a lot of fun, and I-I do call it"
847,00:37:27.27,00:37:27.27,"the love shack, because, you know, we all are right there."
848,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,"Um, there's a lot of positive energy that's being provided,"
849,00:37:33.03,00:37:33.03,"uh, when we talk about one another's lives, and"
850,00:37:35.80,00:37:35.80,it-it's really been a lot of fun.
851,00:37:37.90,00:37:37.90,"Now, within the love shack,"
852,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,"you still have to stay dry, you still have to eat."
853,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,"Matthew, let's talk about what's happening with roles."
854,00:37:46.27,00:37:46.27,"I relish the role of, uh, provider, because"
855,00:37:51.47,00:37:51.47,"I think that we as a group need to eat well,"
856,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,and eating 12 fish for dinner really is a...
857,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,is a great thing.
858,00:38:01.73,00:38:01.73,"Rob, what's your role? You're always good for a laugh."
859,00:38:04.40,00:38:04.40,Is that your role?
860,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,I like to try to keep the tribe entertained.
861,00:38:08.23,00:38:08.23,I feel like anytime that we're bored
862,00:38:10.70,00:38:10.70,"or just sitting around doing nothing,"
863,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,"that our energy level is just sinking,"
864,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,"so I'm always trying to think of a bunch of games,"
865,00:38:16.23,00:38:16.23,"or stupid songs to sing, or, you know, any sort of thing"
866,00:38:19.47,00:38:19.47,"that we could just have a group discussion about,"
867,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"'cause I feel like it really helps,"
868,00:38:22.50,00:38:22.50,"not only to break the ice,"
869,00:38:23.93,00:38:23.93,but also just to keep everybody's energy level up.
870,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,"-And it's really fun. -PROBST: How about for you, Shawna?"
871,00:38:28.47,00:38:28.47,I know you've had some up days and some down days
872,00:38:30.97,00:38:30.97,in these first 18 days.
873,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,-How are you feeling now? -I'm doing awesome.
874,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27,I've gone from probably one of my darkest hours
875,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,ever as a person--
876,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,"just completely in the dumps, just wanted out,"
877,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,"but... and then, all of a sudden, as soon as"
878,00:38:45.23,00:38:45.23,we get this infusion of energy
879,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,"from the guys, and the dynamics change,"
880,00:38:48.97,00:38:48.97,"and all of a sudden, the games picked up, and"
881,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,"it feels like it's a game, and it's fun..."
882,00:38:53.23,00:38:53.23,"you just.. all of a sudden,"
883,00:38:54.57,00:38:54.57,"I went to the most, like, ultimate high."
884,00:38:56.03,00:38:56.03,I'm glowing these days.
885,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03,"So, give it to me. You are in this for the long haul then?"
886,00:39:00.90,00:39:00.90,-Are you here? -Of course I'm in it for the long haul.
887,00:39:03.07,00:39:03.07,"No, I'm... You know, like, what I needed"
888,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,"was someone to take my head out of my butt, and they did it."
889,00:39:09.13,00:39:09.13,"Deena, is this a hard vote for you,"
890,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"or because you're not part of this young group,"
891,00:39:13.23,00:39:13.23,"are you able to just step back and say,"
892,00:39:15.07,00:39:15.07,"""At least I don't have that headache""?"
893,00:39:17.10,00:39:17.10,"Fortunately, I can say that I am part of this young group."
894,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,I would say that this was...
895,00:39:21.37,00:39:21.37,is the absolute most difficult vote that we have had to date.
896,00:39:25.30,00:39:25.30,"Difficult or not, it is time to vote."
897,00:39:28.47,00:39:28.47,"Jenna, you're up."
898,00:39:54.53,00:39:54.53,"I think you're one of the nicest people I ever met,"
899,00:39:58.23,00:39:58.23,and you put what's good for others
900,00:40:00.27,00:40:00.27,before what's good for you.
901,00:40:02.77,00:40:02.77,"Unfortunately,"
902,00:40:04.30,00:40:04.30,that also makes you a really terrible Survivor player.
903,00:40:28.03,00:40:28.03,"Matt, I'm voting for you, because later on down the line,"
904,00:40:31.33,00:40:31.33,"you may be a threat, and, uh, I don't know."
905,00:40:35.23,00:40:35.23,We'll see what happens.
906,00:40:50.07,00:40:50.07,I'll go tally the votes.
907,00:41:01.97,00:41:01.97,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
908,00:41:03.97,00:41:03.97,The person voted out will be asked
909,00:41:05.57,00:41:05.57,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
910,00:41:07.20,00:41:07.20,I'll read the votes.
911,00:41:10.23,00:41:10.23,First vote--
912,00:41:13.03,00:41:13.03,Shawna.
913,00:41:18.30,00:41:18.30,Matt.
914,00:41:20.43,00:41:20.43,"One vote-- Shawna, one vote-- Matt."
915,00:41:25.30,00:41:25.30,Shawna.
916,00:41:26.60,00:41:26.60,Two votes-- Shawna.
917,00:41:30.63,00:41:30.63,Two votes-- Matt.
918,00:41:33.57,00:41:33.57,"We're tied. Two votes-- Shawna, two votes-- Matt."
919,00:41:40.90,00:41:40.90,That's three votes-- Shawna.
920,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,Last vote.
921,00:41:47.93,00:41:47.93,Sixth person voted
922,00:41:48.93,00:41:48.93,out of the Amazon--
923,00:41:50.80,00:41:50.80,Shawna.
924,00:41:52.20,00:41:52.20,You need to bring me your torch.
925,00:42:06.03,00:42:06.03,"Shawna, the tribe has spoken."
926,00:42:22.57,00:42:22.57,"Well, this is certainly"
927,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,a rollercoaster of highs and lows.
928,00:42:26.87,00:42:26.87,"And this tribe has already had its fair share,"
929,00:42:29.33,00:42:29.33,including tough decisions like you had to make tonight.
930,00:42:32.27,00:42:32.27,We're only 18 days in.
931,00:42:33.93,00:42:33.93,"Got to keep your head, because"
932,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,there is a lot more still to come.
933,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
934,00:42:39.13,00:42:39.13,Good night.
935,00:42:52.37,00:42:52.37,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
936,00:42:58.70,00:42:58.70,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
937,00:43:01.13,00:43:01.13,-There it is. -Here's the key!
938,00:43:03.73,00:43:03.73,PROBST: The tribes learn  the secret of the locked box.
939,00:43:06.53,00:43:06.53,"DEENA: I don't think I have seen  Jaburu move that fast,"
940,00:43:09.23,00:43:09.23,ever.
941,00:43:10.13,00:43:10.13,PROBST: And it all comes off  at the immunity challenge.
942,00:43:13.03,00:43:13.03,"-Heidi, do you want to pull your pants down? -BUTCH: Oh, my!"
943,00:43:14.80,00:43:14.80,"-I'm not looking. -Oh, I'm looking."
944,00:43:16.73,00:43:16.73,"-Are you kidding me? -Oh, my God."
945,00:43:22.77,00:43:22.77,I went through so much in this brief amount of time.
946,00:43:25.37,00:43:25.37,I don't think I've ever had a bigger crash course in life.
947,00:43:28.43,00:43:28.43," At age 24, I never thought"
948,00:43:30.03,00:43:30.03, I'd be so touched  by an experience.
949,00:43:32.30,00:43:32.30," My trip may have ended here,"
950,00:43:33.87,00:43:33.87, but this is only the beginning  of an absolutely new me.
951,00:43:38.07,00:43:38.07,"You guys, thank you so much for the time of my life."
952,00:43:41.13,00:43:41.13,You're awesome.
