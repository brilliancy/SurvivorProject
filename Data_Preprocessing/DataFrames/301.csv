660,00:34:41.07,00:34:41.07,It wasa judgment call.
661,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,It was a judgmentcall I made.
662,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,- It wasa bad damn judgment.

692,00:35:32.37,00:35:32.37,a situation where wewere starting to build trust.
693,00:35:34.93,00:35:34.93,"The trust has been broken,"
694,00:35:36.67,00:35:36.67,and it needs to be builtfrom square one.
695,00:35:38.27,00:35:38.27,"We need to startover now, because right now,"
696,00:35:39.87,00:35:39.87,we're all wondering if we canleave anybody alone.

698,00:35:43.60,00:35:43.60,you'd be kickedout of there so fast.

712,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,- I don't know about that.
713,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,- You didn't ask for them?- You didn't ask for food?
714,00:36:11.03,00:36:11.03,- I didn't ask.
715,00:36:12.13,00:36:12.13,"He said he was going to open upbecause he said,"
716,00:36:13.30,00:36:13.30,"""I needed to eat."""

727,00:36:41.23,00:36:41.23,"- What more do you want meto say, Tommy?"
728,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,- Today's a hard day for us.
729,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,- We have got to--- We've got to vote.

735,00:37:25.93,00:37:25.93,"At Tribal Council, firemost definitely represents life."
736,00:37:31.10,00:37:31.10,"As long as you have fire,you're still alive."
737,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,"When your flame is out,the game is over for you."
738,00:37:39.60,00:37:39.60,"So there's fire relatingto ritual,"
739,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"and then there'sfire relating to real life,"
740,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"as you guys havefigured out,"
741,00:37:45.27,00:37:45.27,living withoutit for two nights.

752,00:38:11.73,00:38:11.73,We're all dehydrated.
753,00:38:13.10,00:38:13.10,Let's talk aboutthe first challenge.
754,00:38:14.43,00:38:14.43,"Diane, obviously, it wastough on you."
755,00:38:17.80,00:38:17.80,"Yeah, itwas tough on me."
756,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,"We had tried to build a fire allday in the sun,"
757,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,"and you know, sat outthere in the sun with no water."
758,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"And then having to go do thischallenge,"
759,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40,I was done--I was just out.
760,00:38:29.63,00:38:29.63,I was out of gas.
761,00:38:31.27,00:38:31.27,"- Clarence, what'sit been like living together"
762,00:38:34.30,00:38:34.30,as a group so far?
763,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"It has definitelybeen awesome,"
764,00:38:39.13,00:38:39.13,despite the factthat we haven't had water.
765,00:38:41.40,00:38:41.40,Everybody here is really justgotten to gel
766,00:38:44.63,00:38:44.63,"to the pointwhere even when we mess up,"
767,00:38:46.27,00:38:46.27,we feel bad about it.
768,00:38:48.47,00:38:48.47,"I know I did somethings today,"
769,00:38:49.60,00:38:49.60,and I feelhorrible about it.
770,00:38:50.87,00:38:50.87,"And you know, it's just..."
771,00:38:52.83,00:38:52.83,you don't feel like thatwith strangers.
772,00:38:54.07,00:38:54.07,You feel like that about withpeople you seriously care about.
773,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,- Fill me in--What happened today?
774,00:38:59.20,00:38:59.20,"- You know, today, a teammatewas not feeling well,"
775,00:39:04.20,00:39:04.20,and I decidedto open a can of beans
776,00:39:08.17,00:39:08.17,to make them feel better.
777,00:39:09.90,00:39:09.90,"While I had the can open,I ate some, too."
778,00:39:12.53,00:39:12.53,And that wasn't fair.
779,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,"Like I said,it was something stupid,"
780,00:39:15.17,00:39:15.17,and I seriously hope theyforgive me for it.
781,00:39:17.23,00:39:17.23,"- Ethan, what was yourreaction when you came back?"
782,00:39:19.50,00:39:19.50,- I was pretty pissed off.
783,00:39:21.83,00:39:21.83,I'm very impressed thathe stayed behind
784,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,"and helped out Dianebecause she was feeling sick,"
785,00:39:25.90,00:39:25.90,"and that's very, you know, nobleof a thing to do."
786,00:39:29.93,00:39:29.93,"But, you know,I was a little surprised"
787,00:39:32.90,00:39:32.90,that someone woulddo that.
788,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,- I think he hada weak flaw in his character.
789,00:39:38.30,00:39:38.30,He had a weak moment.
790,00:39:41.57,00:39:41.57,"And I forgive,but I don't forget."
791,00:39:47.50,00:39:47.50,"- All right, let's get totonight's vote."

803,00:40:24.87,00:40:24.87,"which I didn't appreciate atall, since I'm not one."
