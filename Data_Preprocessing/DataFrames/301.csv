19,00:01:36.77,00:01:36.77,or they'll be voted out of the tribe.

101,00:06:42.40,00:06:42.40,is just a huge amount of weight.
102,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97,Do we have enough water for all day?
103,00:06:47.77,00:06:47.77,- Do we just leave that and take--
104,00:06:49.30,00:06:49.30,"- Yeah, I would empty it out."
105,00:06:51.97,00:06:51.97,- You sure?
106,00:06:53.70,00:06:53.70,"- There were three jugs of water,"
107,00:06:55.73,00:06:55.73,and we took two of them and dumped them out
108,00:06:58.03,00:06:58.03,because they were just too heavy to carry.
109,00:07:00.53,00:07:00.53,We would have had to sacrifice the canned goods
110,00:07:02.40,00:07:02.40,and a lot of the other things
111,00:07:03.40,00:07:03.40,that we thought we couldn't replace.
112,00:07:05.50,00:07:05.50,And we figured we ultimately would get a source of water.
113,00:07:07.67,00:07:07.67,"- All right, you good? - Yeah."
114,00:07:10.67,00:07:10.67,- Diane was the one in charge of the map.
115,00:07:13.23,00:07:13.23,"I don't know if it was the best choice,"
116,00:07:15.33,00:07:15.33,"but she seemed competent,"
117,00:07:16.57,00:07:16.57,which I would say was the first issue of our tribe
118,00:07:19.97,00:07:19.97,was the map problem.
119,00:07:22.83,00:07:22.83,- I'd hate to be carrying this damn thing
120,00:07:24.23,00:07:24.23,and not be being going in the right direction.
121,00:07:26.47,00:07:26.47,"All right, here we go, boys."
122,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,Three!

124,00:07:33.40,00:07:33.40,the rest of them follow.
125,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,"And here we were following this blonde girl,"
126,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,"zigzagging through the desert saying,"
127,00:07:40.27,00:07:40.27,"""I think we're this way."""
128,00:07:42.90,00:07:42.90,"- Okay, we're going right now."
129,00:07:44.80,00:07:44.80,"- Diane, Diane, you're angling off a little bit."
130,00:07:46.87,00:07:46.87,- Left a little.
131,00:07:48.47,00:07:48.47,"- It's a straight line, Diane, right in front of me."
132,00:07:54.33,00:07:54.33,"- Hold up, hold up, Diane."
133,00:07:56.10,00:07:56.10,"-All right, pick it up."
134,00:07:58.50,00:07:58.50,-I don't necessarily want the command.
135,00:08:00.60,00:08:00.60,-I just want to get us there. - I agree.
136,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,"- I carry mail, so I just kind of went at my pace,"
137,00:08:05.80,00:08:05.80,which is probably faster than most people.
138,00:08:07.63,00:08:07.63,And I got way out there and then ended up having to wait.
139,00:08:10.67,00:08:10.67,"- All right, let's move-- All right, move them."
140,00:08:13.40,00:08:13.40,"- All right, we're coming. - Here we come."
141,00:08:15.53,00:08:15.53,"Oh, yeah."
142,00:08:16.73,00:08:16.73,- Is this better for you?
143,00:08:18.07,00:08:18.07,"- Yeah, I got the corn meal in my face"
144,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,"so I can't put it on my shoulders,"
145,00:08:21.40,00:08:21.40,"but I'm just holding it up with my arms and when I get tired,"
146,00:08:23.67,00:08:23.67,I'll have somebody move the corn meal.
147,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
148,00:08:37.23,00:08:37.23,"- Hey, guys. (whistling)"
149,00:08:39.90,00:08:39.90,- What's the matter?
150,00:08:41.30,00:08:41.30,"- Okay, hold up-- Halt."
151,00:08:45.10,00:08:45.10,"- Let me, uh..."
152,00:08:46.87,00:08:46.87,"All right, you got it, my man? - Yeah."
153,00:08:48.23,00:08:48.23,- Let's put it up on our shoulders.
154,00:08:49.93,00:08:49.93,Take it up-- What do you think?
155,00:08:52.70,00:08:52.70,"What do you think, Brandon?"
156,00:08:53.80,00:08:53.80,"- Oh, I think that'll be fine."
157,00:08:54.90,00:08:54.90,How tall are you?
158,00:08:57.27,00:08:57.27,And my shoulders are not that tall or as wide as this either.
159,00:09:00.10,00:09:00.10,- Are you guys all right-- Let's rock 'n' roll.
160,00:09:02.60,00:09:02.60,- So how was the walk?
161,00:09:03.80,00:09:03.80,"Did you feel it was comfortable, moving along at a good pace?"
162,00:09:07.17,00:09:07.17,Everything absolutely no.
163,00:09:08.97,00:09:08.97,- Brandon...
164,00:09:10.50,00:09:10.50,"- Yes, ma'am?"
165,00:09:11.97,00:09:11.97,- What's your luxury item?
166,00:09:13.43,00:09:13.43,"- Uh, it's chopsticks. - All right, are we ready?"
167,00:09:16.40,00:09:16.40,- Are you serious? - Yes.
168,00:09:18.60,00:09:18.60,- You rock.
169,00:09:20.43,00:09:20.43,"- Now we're back to, you know,"
170,00:09:21.57,00:09:21.57,"""J.C. Penney's, this is what I bought,"
171,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,"did you see that guy-- Oh, he's so cute."""
172,00:09:24.77,00:09:24.77,I'm having these problems at home.
173,00:09:26.53,00:09:26.53,- I started my period.
174,00:09:28.07,00:09:28.07,"Oh, man, no wonder I have cramps."
175,00:09:31.87,00:09:31.87,"- Excuse me, Africa."
176,00:09:33.10,00:09:33.10,"We're not down at the mall, here, you know,"
177,00:09:35.50,00:09:35.50,sitting outside with a latte here or something.
178,00:09:38.20,00:09:38.20,Let's just get moving along here.
179,00:09:49.63,00:09:49.63,- Frank is like a big strong ex-army guy
180,00:09:52.23,00:09:52.23,"and when we were hiking, he was like a block away from us,"
181,00:09:56.13,00:09:56.13,just trooping on all by himself.
182,00:09:58.03,00:09:58.03,And the rest of us are all in a pack back there.
183,00:10:00.20,00:10:00.20,"And he would, like, stop and wait for us"
184,00:10:02.20,00:10:02.20,and you could just tell you he was really put out and...
185,00:10:04.13,00:10:04.13,"- Keep them moving, will you?"
186,00:10:05.43,00:10:05.43,Keep them moving.
187,00:10:06.67,00:10:06.67,"- It's hard to keep moving. -I know, but keep them moving."
188,00:10:09.40,00:10:09.40,"- ""Socialize later, we can laugh later around the campfire."""
189,00:10:12.33,00:10:12.33,"I'm just like, ""Dude, we're not all like you."""
190,00:10:16.30,00:10:16.30,"It's, like, no compassion at all for the rest of us, at all."
191,00:10:22.17,00:10:22.17,"- You all right-- Whoa, whoa-- Whoa, whoa."
192,00:10:25.30,00:10:25.30,"- Every time I stop, this gets heavier."

194,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50,"- Oh, you okay?"
195,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,"-Diane, are you all right?"
196,00:10:56.00,00:10:56.00,- Yes.
197,00:10:59.00,00:10:59.00,- Let's keep going.
198,00:11:00.20,00:11:00.20,"- All right, just keep going straight, man."
199,00:11:01.87,00:11:01.87,"- Pick it up, pick it up."
200,00:11:03.70,00:11:03.70,- I think I see the sign.
201,00:11:07.47,00:11:07.47,"- Oh yeah! - Yes, right there."
202,00:11:11.77,00:11:11.77,- All right!
203,00:11:13.33,00:11:13.33,- Woo! - Oh!
204,00:11:15.80,00:11:15.80,"- Here we go, Boran-- All right!"
205,00:11:25.97,00:11:25.97,- Yes.
206,00:11:26.77,00:11:26.77,- Good job. - Yeah.
207,00:11:30.43,00:11:30.43,- All right.
208,00:11:31.23,00:11:31.23,- That's our tribal handshake.
209,00:11:33.20,00:11:33.20,- Everybody got it down?

211,00:11:42.33,00:11:42.33,"- Come on, we're walking in together."
212,00:11:44.53,00:11:44.53,"- Oh, my God, that rocks!"
213,00:11:47.03,00:11:47.03,"- Seeing that Survivor flag,"
214,00:11:49.17,00:11:49.17,it's just not real until you're here.
215,00:11:51.60,00:11:51.60,"And seeing that flag, everyone just wanted"
216,00:11:53.30,00:11:53.30,"to pass out, of course."
217,00:11:54.60,00:11:54.60,Then Frank was all yelling at us
218,00:11:56.50,00:11:56.50,to pick up the pace now that we saw the flag.
219,00:11:59.47,00:11:59.47,"- Come on, guys, pick it up-- The sun's going down."
220,00:12:02.13,00:12:02.13,"- And we're just dragging ourselves to get there, so..."
221,00:12:06.37,00:12:06.37,"- Frank, what branch of the service were you in?"
222,00:12:09.10,00:12:09.10,- I was in the American branch.
223,00:12:11.80,00:12:11.80,It's called freedom. - You guys all right?
224,00:12:17.13,00:12:17.13,(all cheering)
225,00:12:33.40,00:12:33.40,(chattering)
226,00:12:36.83,00:12:36.83,"- Oh, my God."
227,00:12:38.27,00:12:38.27,"- Hey, you guys, check this out."
228,00:12:41.97,00:12:41.97,"Hey, you guys, there's another note."
229,00:12:44.20,00:12:44.20,"- Read, read, read."
230,00:12:45.37,00:12:45.37,"- ""Welcome to your new home."

250,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,- Keep piecing it up until it's uniform.
251,00:13:42.37,00:13:42.37,There's a lot more in those trees.
252,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83,You don't have to venture out in the bush.
253,00:13:45.87,00:13:45.87,Just come around the corner.
254,00:13:47.57,00:13:47.57,- He's just the biggest baby I've ever met.
255,00:13:49.10,00:13:49.10,- He pretty much is. - Just keep smiling.
256,00:13:51.10,00:13:51.10,- Mm-hmm. - That's what I'm doing.
257,00:13:53.50,00:13:53.50,"- Well, Frank is just, like--"
258,00:13:55.23,00:13:55.23,he was trying to hurry us along and that's not my style.
259,00:13:57.53,00:13:57.53,"I like to bond, I like to talk to people."
260,00:13:59.40,00:13:59.40,- That's awesome.
261,00:14:00.73,00:14:00.73,- This is also a time where I want to enjoy some of it.
262,00:14:03.13,00:14:03.13,I don't want to... I'm not military.
263,00:14:05.10,00:14:05.10,I don't need it in my life.
264,00:14:06.93,00:14:06.93,"I don't need all that structure, you know,"
265,00:14:08.57,00:14:08.57,"I think we'll get stuff done without having, like,"

267,00:14:12.07,00:14:12.07,and every single thing be single file.
268,00:14:13.60,00:14:13.60,That's just not me.
269,00:14:14.80,00:14:14.80,- We've got two of those-- How full are they?
270,00:14:18.07,00:14:18.07,"- This one's full, this one here is not."
271,00:14:20.33,00:14:20.33,"It's, like, maybe half, maybe not that."
272,00:14:22.13,00:14:22.13,"Well, right now, we have a really drastic water situation."

274,00:14:27.50,00:14:27.50,and we broke three gourds on the way on the hike.
275,00:14:30.47,00:14:30.47,The gourds are very fragile.
276,00:14:32.17,00:14:32.17,And we lost the cap on one of them.
277,00:14:33.93,00:14:33.93,And apparently when you don't cap the water
278,00:14:36.07,00:14:36.07,"that's in the gourd, it turns into, like, turpentine."
279,00:14:39.00,00:14:39.00,"- Oh, so bad."
280,00:14:41.07,00:14:41.07,"- I mean, we've got to get water, like, in the next hour"
281,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,or we're just going to be so screwed.
282,00:14:48.83,00:14:48.83,(all chatting at once)
283,00:14:52.83,00:14:52.83,- There's one of those deadly giraffes.
284,00:14:56.27,00:14:56.27,- Giraffes... Zebras.
285,00:15:01.57,00:15:01.57,- Look out for those big...
286,00:15:04.90,00:15:04.90,tampano. - Tampano.
287,00:15:06.90,00:15:06.90,- Do not touch the tampano.
288,00:15:08.70,00:15:08.70,- Don't mess with the Samburu tampanos.
289,00:15:11.13,00:15:11.13,- This is really the mother continent for me.
290,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,"I don't know if this makes any sense, but Mother Africa,"
291,00:15:15.03,00:15:15.03,"and I've been here before, I have tremendous respect,"
292,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,and when the tribe was joking about the tamborunos
293,00:15:20.07,00:15:20.07,"or the tampons in Samburu, my reaction to that,"
294,00:15:23.27,00:15:23.27,"inside I was thinking, ""Oh, my God, that is so disrespectful."
295,00:15:26.73,00:15:26.73,"The Samburu people, you know, civilization, ages and ages ago."
296,00:15:30.97,00:15:30.97,Do you realize where you are?
297,00:15:33.03,00:15:33.03,"This is where it all started, folks, in Africa."""
298,00:15:38.63,00:15:38.63,- My God. - It's so sick.
299,00:15:42.93,00:15:42.93,"I mean, it's just covered in crap."
300,00:15:45.13,00:15:45.13,- Geez.
301,00:15:46.57,00:15:46.57,I don't even want to touch the water.
302,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,You know what I mean?
303,00:15:49.80,00:15:49.80,- This all looks pretty stagnant.
304,00:15:53.57,00:15:53.57,"- Whatever we do, we've got to get our water"
305,00:15:54.40,00:15:54.40,and get out of here.
306,00:15:56.27,00:15:56.27,- Do you guys see any food in here anywhere?
307,00:15:57.93,00:15:57.93,- The water is disgusting-- I'm terrified.
308,00:16:00.73,00:16:00.73,"It's sick-- I mean, I was filling it up, and it was so..."
309,00:16:04.27,00:16:04.27,"it was this deep, so you get water mixed with crud."
310,00:16:11.60,00:16:11.60,"- We're pulling water out of a very, like, murky..."
311,00:16:13.87,00:16:13.87,"tadpoles are running all over it,"
312,00:16:15.67,00:16:15.67,"like pond scum, kind of little water hole."
313,00:16:18.93,00:16:18.93,"So the water is contaminated,"
314,00:16:21.00,00:16:21.00,and it has to be boiled for at least five minutes over a fire
315,00:16:24.23,00:16:24.23,before we can drink it.
316,00:16:31.03,00:16:31.03,- Okay. - Take your time.
317,00:16:32.83,00:16:32.83,- You don't have to go fast. - Right.
318,00:16:34.20,00:16:34.20,It's in the technique. - You can do it.
319,00:16:36.40,00:16:36.40,- We need a little oxygen here.
320,00:16:40.67,00:16:40.67,- Let me know when you're ready.
321,00:16:42.03,00:16:42.03,- You can smell it.
322,00:16:43.27,00:16:43.27,"- Whoa, man-- Come on."
323,00:16:48.47,00:16:48.47,(chattering)
324,00:16:53.00,00:16:53.00,"- You have to have a fire,"
325,00:16:54.87,00:16:54.87,"and even the Masai tribesman said without the fire,"
326,00:16:57.23,00:16:57.23,you can't live in this land.
327,00:16:58.97,00:16:58.97,"Fire is not for warmth,"
328,00:17:00.23,00:17:00.23,what everyone would think of right away
329,00:17:01.77,00:17:01.77,"or for security right away,"
330,00:17:03.07,00:17:03.07,but the water has to be boiled three to five minutes.
331,00:17:06.33,00:17:06.33,It has to be purified for us to drink.
332,00:17:09.10,00:17:09.10,"See now, look."
333,00:17:10.73,00:17:10.73,"- Feel the tip, I'll bet you it's hot."
334,00:17:12.03,00:17:12.03,- Gosh dang.
335,00:17:13.87,00:17:13.87,"-We thought we'd get a fire, faster than we, of course, did."
336,00:17:17.43,00:17:17.43,"- As hard as we were working, we just couldn't seem to get it."
337,00:17:20.57,00:17:20.57,"And then, of course, we were tired from the long day."
338,00:17:23.17,00:17:23.17,"It was getting dark and we still kept trying and trying,"
339,00:17:25.33,00:17:25.33,"even when it was dark, to try to get the fire going."
340,00:17:27.37,00:17:27.37,"That was, you know, a big frustration."
341,00:17:30.43,00:17:30.43,"- You happy, Frank?"
342,00:17:31.73,00:17:31.73,(distant lion roar) - I've been happier.
343,00:17:34.83,00:17:34.83,- You're too hard on yourself.
344,00:17:35.90,00:17:35.90,You got us here-- You should be very happy-- We are.
345,00:17:38.67,00:17:38.67,- I spent nine months in softness in my mother's womb.
346,00:17:42.87,00:17:42.87,Everything else after that is hard when you come out.
347,00:17:46.07,00:17:46.07,"- Wait a minute, wait a minute-- Hold it, Frank."
348,00:17:50.73,00:17:50.73,- Push the rod down.
349,00:17:59.07,00:17:59.07,- What happened? - It broke-- The rope broke.
350,00:18:01.03,00:18:01.03,- Oh-- It's still hot. - Can't you try it?
351,00:18:05.33,00:18:05.33,(lion growling)
352,00:18:09.63,00:18:09.63,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa

354,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,- Are you all right-- Get some water.
355,00:18:29.40,00:18:29.40,-We don't have any.
356,00:18:30.47,00:18:30.47,"- I don't think anybody,"
357,00:18:32.03,00:18:32.03,"unless they've been put in a situation like this,"
358,00:18:34.17,00:18:34.17,really know how much water your body really needs.
359,00:18:40.07,00:18:40.07,"I mean, I really need water right now."
360,00:18:42.37,00:18:42.37,I really do-- I'm so dehydrated.
361,00:18:47.43,00:18:47.43,"- All right, get right here. - Pull back."
362,00:18:50.50,00:18:50.50,"- Now, look, what we want to do is get it deep enough."
363,00:18:53.50,00:18:53.50,"All right, stick it-- Now, you get your ass back here."
364,00:18:57.47,00:18:57.47,"All right, where I am, get right here."
365,00:18:59.33,00:18:59.33,"- Guys, you've got to be quick because this place isn't safe."
366,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47,- Okay-- We'll clean this out.
367,00:19:05.27,00:19:05.27,We need to get our water.
368,00:19:07.17,00:19:07.17,"\xe2\x99\xaa You get a line I get a bow, babe \xe2\x99\xaa"
369,00:19:10.40,00:19:10.40,(together) - \xe2\x99\xaa You get a line I get a bow \xe2\x99\xaa

371,00:19:16.60,00:19:16.60,"All right, let's let it settle."
372,00:19:20.13,00:19:20.13,I know exactly what I'm doing here.
373,00:19:23.53,00:19:23.53,"Woo, woo!"
374,00:19:27.10,00:19:27.10,- We got water. - Whoo!
375,00:19:32.43,00:19:32.43,"- Without fire, you can't boil the water."
376,00:19:34.73,00:19:34.73,- Anybody knows that you don't just belly up to the stream
377,00:19:36.97,00:19:36.97,"that you're camping next to, drop your canteen in it"
378,00:19:39.97,00:19:39.97,and drink the water.
379,00:19:41.10,00:19:41.10,"If you don't boil your water out here,"
380,00:19:42.30,00:19:42.30,"you end up with what they call amebic dysentery,"
381,00:19:44.43,00:19:44.43,which basically has you puking and crapping your guts out.
382,00:19:51.53,00:19:51.53,- It's starting to just... it's getting worse.
383,00:19:52.93,00:19:52.93,I got another one that's about to open up.
384,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,- Yeah.
385,00:19:57.43,00:19:57.43,"Yeah, if you can keep it hot-- Ethan's good at it."
386,00:20:00.40,00:20:00.40,I'll keep it hot.
387,00:20:04.23,00:20:04.23,- Have I done anything?
388,00:20:06.70,00:20:06.70,Just can not get a spin on it.
389,00:20:13.07,00:20:13.07,- You do realize that after we give it
390,00:20:14.47,00:20:14.47,"everything we have in this challenge and we win,"
391,00:20:16.73,00:20:16.73,we're going be so happy.
392,00:20:18.40,00:20:18.40,- Are you kidding me?
393,00:20:19.67,00:20:19.67,- All eight of us son of a (bleep) might pass out.
394,00:20:22.67,00:20:22.67,"- That's fine-- We pass out next to a fire,"
395,00:20:25.53,00:20:25.53,that's going to be the best sleep I ever had.
396,00:20:27.57,00:20:27.57,"- You know, it doesn't seem possible that we can go"
397,00:20:28.87,00:20:28.87,"another whole day without it,"
398,00:20:30.23,00:20:30.23,- so don't even... - That's what I said.
399,00:20:31.80,00:20:31.80,"- You know, we may be a little dehydrated,"
400,00:20:35.10,00:20:35.10,but it's not like we're going to die or something.

402,00:20:49.97,00:20:49.97,(chattering)
403,00:20:54.57,00:20:54.57,- I just opened the medicine cabinet.
404,00:20:56.10,00:20:56.10,I don't think anybody's opened it up.
405,00:20:57.43,00:20:57.43,- Where's Linds? - Yeah?

409,00:21:04.53,00:21:04.53,"- Kim and somebody, I think Linda,"
410,00:21:06.37,00:21:06.37,just decided to open the medical kit
411,00:21:07.80,00:21:07.80,"to see what was in there,"
412,00:21:09.47,00:21:09.47,"and you know, tampons and stuff that we need,"
413,00:21:12.43,00:21:12.43,and in the medical kit there just happened to be
414,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,"a telescope for us to, you know, watch out for animals."
415,00:21:18.77,00:21:18.77,"I don't know a lot about telescopes, but I know that"
416,00:21:20.50,00:21:20.50,a magnifying glass can start a fire.
417,00:21:22.07,00:21:22.07,"I had no idea whether or not that was a magnifying glass,"
418,00:21:24.53,00:21:24.53,"but I unscrewed the telescope, pulled out the lens,"
419,00:21:28.37,00:21:28.37,"and Silas was right there and I was like,"
420,00:21:29.43,00:21:29.43,"""Silas, isn't there something we can do with this?"""
421,00:21:41.13,00:21:41.13,- That sucker's hot. - Yeah.
422,00:21:43.43,00:21:43.43,Does your arm hurt?
423,00:21:44.53,00:21:44.53,"Like, would it help if I put my hand under your elbow?"
424,00:21:46.23,00:21:46.23,"- No, it's okay."
425,00:21:48.13,00:21:48.13,"- Oh, my God."
426,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,"Okay, do we have a little fire? - Shh... Let's not jinx this."
427,00:21:53.27,00:21:53.27,Let's just get this damn thing smoldering.
428,00:21:55.20,00:21:55.20,"- Oh, you dumb ass. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
429,00:21:57.60,00:21:57.60,You're doing so well-- It's fine.
430,00:22:01.73,00:22:01.73,"- Careful, Nurse it."

433,00:22:15.07,00:22:15.07,"- Okay, don't inhale that smoke, dude."
434,00:22:17.83,00:22:17.83,"- Careful, careful-- I have a little fire right here."
435,00:22:20.67,00:22:20.67,"Once you get a flame, bring it over here."
436,00:22:23.63,00:22:23.63,"- Do not pass out. - Oh, my God, dude."
437,00:22:29.83,00:22:29.83,"- Holy cow-- Oh, my God."
438,00:22:33.13,00:22:33.13,- Just keep blowing.
439,00:22:36.00,00:22:36.00,- There you go-- There you go.
440,00:22:37.27,00:22:37.27,"- Give me some wood-- Back up, back up, back up."

443,00:22:47.03,00:22:47.03,- Do we need to put this on top of it
444,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,or set this upside-down on it?
445,00:22:49.73,00:22:49.73,How do you do it?
446,00:22:52.20,00:22:52.20,- Get Frank and those guys-- It's done.

464,00:23:48.87,00:23:48.87,"- Yeah, has anyone had water today at all?"
465,00:23:51.03,00:23:51.03,- I had one sip.
466,00:23:52.20,00:23:52.20,"- Maybe I should try to find us some,"
467,00:23:54.10,00:23:54.10,"like, a can of cherries or something?"
468,00:23:55.60,00:23:55.60,- If we didn't have canned goods--
469,00:23:56.77,00:23:56.77,are you kidding me right now?
470,00:23:57.87,00:23:57.87,We'd have no moisture.
471,00:23:59.10,00:23:59.10,- You guys all cool with that? - All right.
472,00:24:01.37,00:24:01.37,- We open a can of cherries to get some sugar energy
473,00:24:04.20,00:24:04.20,"and we also formed a circle,"
474,00:24:06.60,00:24:06.60,"take a cherry, one cherry, pass it on."
475,00:24:09.40,00:24:09.40,- Mmm.
476,00:24:10.57,00:24:10.57,- Everybody get a cherry in the circle.

483,00:24:27.03,00:24:27.03,I want my equal share of cherries.
484,00:24:29.00,00:24:29.00,"I mean, it's so silly."
485,00:24:30.17,00:24:30.17,"We're talking about cherries here because we're starving,"
486,00:24:32.40,00:24:32.40,"and I definitely, definitely saw Clarence"
487,00:24:35.50,00:24:35.50,take two cherries at one time and pass it around him.
488,00:24:37.60,00:24:37.60,"I mean, it's so tempting in there to take two."
489,00:24:45.93,00:24:45.93,"Everyone's got to take one cherry, pass it on."
490,00:24:47.57,00:24:47.57,"And I saw him take two, which is an issue."

601,00:32:09.87,00:32:09.87,- The water hole. - We have to get water.
602,00:32:11.27,00:32:11.27,"- Yeah, we'll take a walk to the spring"
603,00:32:12.90,00:32:12.90,and we'll bring back our water.
604,00:32:15.10,00:32:15.10,"- Lex, do you need me to go or..."
605,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,- I think we're good.
606,00:32:18.03,00:32:18.03,If we got three guys carrying the big water containers...
607,00:32:22.10,00:32:22.10,- Because I'm going to stay and take care of her.
608,00:32:23.43,00:32:23.43,- That is totally fine. - But if you need me to go...
609,00:32:26.47,00:32:26.47,"- No, you stay. - All right."
610,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,"- We're cool. - All right, be careful."
611,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
612,00:32:47.80,00:32:47.80,"- When we was at that spring I said, ""Do you know what?"
613,00:32:50.50,00:32:50.50,"""Something tells me we should have counted our food"
614,00:32:53.13,00:32:53.13,"because Clarence loves them cherries."""
615,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,"- He doesn't know how to use the can opener, does he?"
616,00:32:57.87,00:32:57.87,- No.
617,00:32:58.87,00:32:58.87,- You think? - Yeah.
618,00:33:00.77,00:33:00.77,We'll see-- We'll see when we get back.
619,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,"- I really hope he's not like that, man."
620,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,"- Right now, Clarence is helping out Diane."
621,00:33:06.93,00:33:06.93,"She's sick, she's dehydrated"
622,00:33:09.27,00:33:09.27,and he might be sipping on our water
623,00:33:11.60,00:33:11.60,"or get everyone out of the camp, maybe he's eating our food."
624,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,I don't know.
625,00:33:15.60,00:33:15.60,- Everybody ready?
626,00:33:18.07,00:33:18.07,- A gourd here.
627,00:33:19.30,00:33:19.30,"- Okay, let's go."
628,00:33:29.37,00:33:29.37,"- We get back to camp, Clarence comes to meet us"
629,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,20 yards from camp.
630,00:33:34.00,00:33:34.00,"Right then, I smelled a little something."
631,00:33:36.60,00:33:36.60,He didn't smell good.
632,00:33:39.40,00:33:39.40,"- No, I'm all right."
633,00:33:40.57,00:33:40.57,"Help them boys up there, they're the ones having trouble."
634,00:33:43.03,00:33:43.03,- You look better. - I feel better.
635,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,"- So when we got on that trail,"
636,00:33:47.93,00:33:47.93,"I sniffed a little bit more,"
637,00:33:49.97,00:33:49.97,been talking to Diane.
638,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,She admits that she give Clarence some water
639,00:33:53.80,00:33:53.80,and they just ate a can of beans.
640,00:33:58.43,00:33:58.43,"- Diane said the best thing to do would be to open up,"
641,00:34:00.90,00:34:00.90,"get her something to eat,"
642,00:34:02.00,00:34:02.00,because we wanted to get her strength up.
643,00:34:03.77,00:34:03.77,"She said, ""Well, maybe something to eat will help."""
644,00:34:05.60,00:34:05.60,"So I said, ""Well, I'll do that."
645,00:34:06.80,00:34:06.80,"""I'll open up a can, maybe get some food in you,"
646,00:34:08.90,00:34:08.90,"that'll make you feel better."""
647,00:34:11.00,00:34:11.00,"- Hey, Clarence, Diane talked like you wanted to eat something"
648,00:34:13.93,00:34:13.93,while we were gone.
649,00:34:15.47,00:34:15.47,"If you have, you need to kind of fess up."
650,00:34:17.70,00:34:17.70,Explain why you thought you should eat a can of food.
651,00:34:21.03,00:34:21.03,"- I got her something to eat,"
652,00:34:22.53,00:34:22.53,so we split it while you were gone
653,00:34:23.70,00:34:23.70,"just so she could feel better and she does,"
654,00:34:25.73,00:34:25.73,"I mean, I ain't got to eat."
655,00:34:28.20,00:34:28.20,It ain't no big deal.
656,00:34:29.80,00:34:29.80,- It's a big deal to me.
657,00:34:31.20,00:34:31.20,"- It's a big deal to me, too."
658,00:34:32.33,00:34:32.33,- And I want to make it straight now.
659,00:34:34.30,00:34:34.30,"Anybody that eats without the rest of us, it's a big deal."
660,00:34:37.57,00:34:37.57,-I opened a can because she needed something to eat.
661,00:34:41.07,00:34:41.07,It was a judgment call.
662,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,It was a judgment call I made.
663,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,- It was a bad damn judgment.
664,00:34:45.40,00:34:45.40,- There's eight of us. - You guys were gone.
665,00:34:47.10,00:34:47.10,- It don't matter-- We're all making it.
666,00:34:48.77,00:34:48.77,You can't make the decision to eat the food.
667,00:34:50.57,00:34:50.57,"- Tommy, Tommy. - Tommy, hell."
668,00:34:51.77,00:34:51.77,- I had to open it for her.
669,00:34:53.07,00:34:53.07,- You didn't have to open it for her.
670,00:34:55.37,00:34:55.37,- Are you a doctor-- Let me see your license.
671,00:34:57.27,00:34:57.27,You ain't no doctor.
672,00:34:58.60,00:34:58.60,- I'm saying I made a call for her.
673,00:35:00.10,00:35:00.10,I did not open a can for me.
674,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,I opened a can for her.
675,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,- But did you eat any? - Yes.
676,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,"- Okay, well, that's the whole point here."
677,00:35:06.20,00:35:06.20,"- You made the call for you, bro."
678,00:35:07.27,00:35:07.27,"- You made the call for you, too."
679,00:35:08.97,00:35:08.97,- You made the call for all of us.
680,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,And I don't think you got that right.
681,00:35:13.47,00:35:13.47,You don't eat without all of us.
682,00:35:15.23,00:35:15.23,- My apologies.
683,00:35:16.17,00:35:16.17,"- Okay, apologize to that one. - I'm sorry."
684,00:35:17.63,00:35:17.63,You took her food.
685,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,"- Apologize to them, you took their food."
686,00:35:19.43,00:35:19.43,- I'm sorry.
687,00:35:20.33,00:35:20.33,"- This man right here, you took his food."
688,00:35:21.63,00:35:21.63,"-I'm sorry-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
689,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,You only got to tell me once.
690,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,- But this issue is cut and dried-- You blew it--
691,00:35:28.27,00:35:28.27,"- Okay, that's all I want to hear."
692,00:35:29.67,00:35:29.67,- and we're pissed off and we now need to deal with
693,00:35:32.37,00:35:32.37,a situation where we were starting to build trust.
694,00:35:34.93,00:35:34.93,"The trust has been broken,"
695,00:35:36.67,00:35:36.67,and it needs to be built from square one.
696,00:35:38.27,00:35:38.27,"We need to start over now, because right now,"
697,00:35:39.87,00:35:39.87,we're all wondering if we can leave anybody alone.
698,00:35:41.87,00:35:41.87,"- If you did that in the army, you made a bad call in the army,"
699,00:35:43.60,00:35:43.60,you'd be kicked out of there so fast.
700,00:35:45.17,00:35:45.17,"- Hell, they'd shoot you. - They'd shoot you."
701,00:35:46.63,00:35:46.63,"- You'd be code red. - I'd shoot you if I had a gun,"
702,00:35:49.17,00:35:49.17,I'd still be shooting.
703,00:35:50.27,00:35:50.27,"- No, no, no, no."
704,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60,A judgment call was made by one person!
705,00:35:54.20,00:35:54.20,- I wasn't going to not tell you guys.
706,00:35:55.60,00:35:55.60,- Where's the can right now?
707,00:35:57.63,00:35:57.63,- I put it up-- I tossed it-- I was walking out--
708,00:36:00.43,00:36:00.43,- Did you hide it?
709,00:36:01.73,00:36:01.73,"-No, I was on my way walking to get some sunscreen,"
710,00:36:03.83,00:36:03.83,and I tossed it.
711,00:36:05.33,00:36:05.33,- I didn't ask for beans.
712,00:36:06.53,00:36:06.53,- Was it one of the big cans of beans?
713,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,- I don't know about that.
714,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,- You didn't ask for them? - You didn't ask for food?
715,00:36:11.03,00:36:11.03,- I didn't ask.
716,00:36:12.13,00:36:12.13,"He said he was going to open up because he said,"
717,00:36:13.30,00:36:13.30,"""I needed to eat."""
718,00:36:14.40,00:36:14.40,"- That's a lie, dude! - I don't know if I trust you."
719,00:36:15.87,00:36:15.87,- That's a lie. - That's not either.
720,00:36:17.40,00:36:17.40,"- That's a lie. - Clarence, that is not."
721,00:36:19.27,00:36:19.27,"- Diane, oh, my God."
722,00:36:21.03,00:36:21.03,"- Clarence, I didn't ask you for a can of beans."
723,00:36:23.70,00:36:23.70,"- I told you I wasn't hungry. - Diane, Diane, Diane."
724,00:36:29.03,00:36:29.03,"- Yesterday, I did this, but what is that jive thing"
725,00:36:31.13,00:36:31.13,that you were showing how to do?
726,00:36:34.47,00:36:34.47,"Today you shake my way, man to man when we shake."
727,00:36:39.43,00:36:39.43,Your way ain't the way I'm going.
728,00:36:41.23,00:36:41.23,"- What more do you want me to say, Tommy?"
729,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,- Today's a hard day for us.
730,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,- We have got to-- - We've got to vote.
731,00:36:46.13,00:36:46.13,- We have to kick one of us out.
732,00:36:47.47,00:36:47.47,Today was not a good day to do this.
733,00:36:59.23,00:36:59.23,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
734,00:37:21.17,00:37:21.17,"- Come on in, guys."
735,00:37:22.20,00:37:22.20,I want you to grab a torch and approach the flame.
736,00:37:25.93,00:37:25.93,"At Tribal Council, fire most definitely represents life."
737,00:37:31.10,00:37:31.10,"As long as you have fire, you're still alive."
738,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,"When your flame is out, the game is over for you."
739,00:37:39.60,00:37:39.60,"So there's fire relating to ritual,"
740,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"and then there's fire relating to real life,"
741,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"as you guys have figured out,"
742,00:37:45.27,00:37:45.27,living without it for two nights.
743,00:37:47.00,00:37:47.00,"So the good news is, tonight seven of you"
744,00:37:50.30,00:37:50.30,will return to camp with fire.
745,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,Bad news is one of you is going home.
746,00:37:55.73,00:37:55.73,"So before we get to tonight's first vote,"
747,00:37:57.70,00:37:57.70,let's have a little chat.
748,00:37:58.93,00:37:58.93,"What's the first thing you're going to do tonight, Jessie,"
749,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"when you go back to camp, having fire?"
750,00:38:02.63,00:38:02.63,- I'll definitely light up a fire and boil water all night.
751,00:38:06.50,00:38:06.50,I don't think any of us is going to sleep tonight.
752,00:38:08.43,00:38:08.43,We're just going to boil water and drink.
753,00:38:11.73,00:38:11.73,We're all dehydrated.
754,00:38:13.10,00:38:13.10,Let's talk about the first challenge.
755,00:38:14.43,00:38:14.43,"Diane, obviously, it was tough on you."
756,00:38:17.80,00:38:17.80,"Yeah, it was tough on me."
757,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,"We had tried to build a fire all day in the sun,"
758,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,"and you know, sat out there in the sun with no water."
759,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"And then having to go do this challenge,"
760,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40,I was done-- I was just out.
761,00:38:29.63,00:38:29.63,I was out of gas.
762,00:38:31.27,00:38:31.27,"- Clarence, what's it been like living together"
763,00:38:34.30,00:38:34.30,as a group so far?
764,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"It has definitely been awesome,"
765,00:38:39.13,00:38:39.13,despite the fact that we haven't had water.
766,00:38:41.40,00:38:41.40,Everybody here is really just gotten to gel
767,00:38:44.63,00:38:44.63,"to the point where even when we mess up,"
768,00:38:46.27,00:38:46.27,we feel bad about it.
769,00:38:48.47,00:38:48.47,"I know I did some things today,"
770,00:38:49.60,00:38:49.60,and I feel horrible about it.
771,00:38:50.87,00:38:50.87,"And you know, it's just..."
772,00:38:52.83,00:38:52.83,you don't feel like that with strangers.
773,00:38:54.07,00:38:54.07,You feel like that about with people you seriously care about.
774,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,- Fill me in-- What happened today?
775,00:38:59.20,00:38:59.20,"- You know, today, a teammate was not feeling well,"
776,00:39:04.20,00:39:04.20,and I decided to open a can of beans
777,00:39:08.17,00:39:08.17,to make them feel better.
778,00:39:09.90,00:39:09.90,"While I had the can open, I ate some, too."
779,00:39:12.53,00:39:12.53,And that wasn't fair.
780,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,"Like I said, it was something stupid,"
781,00:39:15.17,00:39:15.17,and I seriously hope they forgive me for it.
782,00:39:17.23,00:39:17.23,"- Ethan, what was your reaction when you came back?"
783,00:39:19.50,00:39:19.50,- I was pretty pissed off.
784,00:39:21.83,00:39:21.83,I'm very impressed that he stayed behind
785,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,"and helped out Diane because she was feeling sick,"
786,00:39:25.90,00:39:25.90,"and that's very, you know, noble of a thing to do."
787,00:39:29.93,00:39:29.93,"But, you know, I was a little surprised"
788,00:39:32.90,00:39:32.90,that someone would do that.
789,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,- I think he had a weak flaw in his character.
790,00:39:38.30,00:39:38.30,He had a weak moment.
791,00:39:41.57,00:39:41.57,"And I forgive, but I don't forget."
792,00:39:47.50,00:39:47.50,"- All right, let's get to tonight's vote."
793,00:39:49.13,00:39:49.13,Here's how it's going to work.
794,00:39:50.20,00:39:50.20,"One by one, you're going to make your way"
795,00:39:51.80,00:39:51.80,"along here to the voting confessional,"
796,00:39:55.00,00:39:55.00,where you're going to write down the name of the person
797,00:39:56.63,00:39:56.63,"who you're voting for in clear block letters,"
798,00:39:59.87,00:39:59.87,"hold it up, speak your piece."
799,00:40:02.13,00:40:02.13,"Diane, you're first."

801,00:40:19.60,00:40:19.60,- It's Clarence.
802,00:40:20.87,00:40:20.87,"You were kind of deceitful to me today,"
803,00:40:22.77,00:40:22.77,"plus you called me a liar,"
804,00:40:24.87,00:40:24.87,"which I didn't appreciate at all, since I'm not one."

806,00:40:53.60,00:40:53.60,- My vote tonight is Diane.
807,00:40:55.00,00:40:55.00,She's by far the weakest person on our team right now.
808,00:40:58.27,00:40:58.27,That challenge killed us.
809,00:40:59.80,00:40:59.80,"I'm not forgetting about what Clarence did,"
810,00:41:02.03,00:41:02.03,"but if you look, he's a big strong guy"
811,00:41:03.43,00:41:03.43,and we need him for the next little bit
812,00:41:05.57,00:41:05.57,"to help us get some, some challenges won."

814,00:41:27.70,00:41:27.70,- Clarence Black.
815,00:41:29.30,00:41:29.30,He let the team down.
816,00:41:30.73,00:41:30.73,"We was looking for somebody who was strong, but yet he is weak."
817,00:41:34.40,00:41:34.40,"Our tribe will do what it takes to win,"
818,00:41:37.70,00:41:37.70,but we'll do it with our head high.
819,00:41:39.43,00:41:39.43,We will not weaken.

821,00:42:01.37,00:42:01.37,"- Out of all the people who I hung out with,"
822,00:42:03.90,00:42:03.90,you told me that we were the closest.
823,00:42:05.57,00:42:05.57,"And when it came down to it, I took care of you today"
824,00:42:07.73,00:42:07.73,and you lied on me for no reason.
825,00:42:09.73,00:42:09.73,"And for that, I can't forgive you."
826,00:42:11.30,00:42:11.30,And I'm ashamed to tell you that the day I told you
827,00:42:13.67,00:42:13.67,"you're like my mother, you're nothing like my mother."
828,00:42:21.60,00:42:21.60,- I'll go tally the votes.

830,00:42:46.30,00:42:46.30,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
831,00:42:49.63,00:42:49.63,The person voted out will be asked to leave
832,00:42:50.87,00:42:50.87,the Tribal Council area immediately.
833,00:42:53.03,00:42:53.03,I'll read the votes.
834,00:42:57.97,00:42:57.97,The first vote...

837,00:43:10.47,00:43:10.47,Clarence Black.
838,00:43:17.03,00:43:17.03,"Two votes Clarence, two votes Diane."
839,00:43:24.27,00:43:24.27,Three votes Diane.
840,00:43:30.67,00:43:30.67,"Diane-- it's four votes Diane, two votes Clarence."
841,00:43:39.10,00:43:39.10,Diane-- that's five votes.
842,00:43:41.00,00:43:41.00,That's enough.
843,00:43:55.97,00:43:55.97,"Diane, the tribe has spoken."
844,00:44:02.50,00:44:02.50,It's time for you to go.
845,00:44:04.27,00:44:04.27,See ya.
846,00:44:10.43,00:44:10.43,"- Well, a lot has been said here tonight,"
847,00:44:12.00,00:44:12.00,"so I would encourage you, as you head back to camp"
848,00:44:13.63,00:44:13.63,"and boil a lot of water,"
849,00:44:15.40,00:44:15.40,to try and do some mending as a tribe.
850,00:44:17.93,00:44:17.93,You can take your torches and head back to camp.
851,00:44:20.03,00:44:20.03,I'll see you guys tomorrow.

855,00:44:57.33,00:44:57.33,"At Boran, it's boys against girls."
856,00:44:59.90,00:44:59.90,- It wouldn't shock me if they all just thought that they could
857,00:45:01.70,00:45:01.70,do it just without any of us.
858,00:45:03.60,00:45:03.60,We want you on your side.
859,00:45:04.83,00:45:04.83,"(Jeff Probst) At Samburu, lines are drawn in the sand."
860,00:45:07.63,00:45:07.63,Can Silas be trusted?
861,00:45:09.03,00:45:09.03,"- And we're going to take it all the way, trust me."
862,00:45:11.33,00:45:11.33,"- Silas, he's playing both sides,"
863,00:45:13.80,00:45:13.80,but it could backfire on him.
