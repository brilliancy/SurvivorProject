115,00:07:28.17,00:07:28.17,So you will end up with fourpeople wrapping material around
116,00:07:30.62,00:07:30.62,the group.Once you have all the material
117,00:07:33.04,00:07:33.04,"around all four people, youstart moving down field and"

563,00:32:51.96,00:32:51.96,Not going to be asking somebodylike me back.
564,00:32:54.75,00:32:54.75,>> I thought that wasn't fair atall for both of them to come
565,00:32:57.33,00:32:57.33,"back, because it's such a bigadvantage for the two of them."
566,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,">> The fact that you just saidthat, opens another door."
567,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,But we bring somebody else withus.
568,00:33:07.04,00:33:07.04,Could be Gary.>> When Danni mentioned Bobby
569,00:33:09.58,00:33:09.58,"Jon's name, I said, there is myangle."
570,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,"Nobody wants to vote anybodyoff, but Bobby Jon has been here"
571,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,"two times in a row, so I'mthinking if I can get Gary to do"
572,00:33:17.92,00:33:17.92,"it and then we get Danni, youknow, that's my last shot,"
573,00:33:20.75,00:33:20.75,basically.>> Danni brought up Bobby Jon's
574,00:33:25.04,00:33:25.04,"name.>> Well, here's the deal."
575,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,Danni and Brandon are runningthe show.
576,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,">> You're right.>> Okay, and if they are looking"

579,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,"Danni's your play.>> I know, but do I have you?"
580,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,">> If you got Danni, you got me.>> My angle right now is Gary."
581,00:33:45.46,00:33:45.46,"And I got to hope on Danni.Hopefully, there will be three"
582,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,"votes for Bobby Jon.It will be a miracle, but I have"
583,00:33:51.12,00:33:51.12,"had miracles in the past, so Iwon't be giving up on that."

591,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,"That's life, bro.>> I want to make it to the"
592,00:34:33.29,00:34:33.29,jury.To me that would be a lifelong
593,00:34:35.79,00:34:35.79,dream come true.>> Nobody gets second chances.
594,00:34:37.79,00:34:37.79,"And I have been given one,and I just don't want to blow"

602,00:35:05.71,00:35:05.71,"Bobby Jon and Stephanie had achance to play this game before,"
603,00:35:09.79,00:35:09.79,"and none of us have.>> Yeah, like, she is probably"
604,00:35:12.83,00:35:12.83,"more deserving being here thanBobby Jon, and that's what has"
605,00:35:15.62,00:35:15.62,"been getting to me, you know?Because you form alliances and"
606,00:35:19.88,00:35:19.88,then you end up voting outpeople that may deserve to be
607,00:35:23.04,00:35:23.04,here more than other people thatare in your alliance.
608,00:35:26.62,00:35:26.62,>> Right.>> I'm somewhat conflicted
609,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,"because here I have my alliancewith Bobby Jon and everything,"
610,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,"but I believe that these otherpeople, you know, Gary and Amy,"
611,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,"maybe, deserve to be here alittle bit more than he does"
612,00:35:38.58,00:35:38.58,because he has already had hisshot.
613,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,This is probably the mostcomplicated spot I have been in
614,00:35:46.96,00:35:46.96,"the game, and it's really takinga toll on my mind."
615,00:35:51.54,00:35:51.54,"You getting that rain past us?I mean, it doesn't say in"

618,00:36:01.38,00:36:01.38,"You are doing this stuff, why?So you can get one step closer"
619,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,"to a million dollars, and it'slike you're selling your soul or"
620,00:36:06.75,00:36:06.75,"something.>> PROBST: So, Danni, Day 18,"

629,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,"because the energy, the attitudeand how close we have gotten"

635,00:37:19.79,00:37:19.79,"else, you know?You get to know these people."
636,00:37:22.50,00:37:22.50,You go through tough times andyou bond together.
637,00:37:25.12,00:37:25.12,"I mean, I love these guys.>> PROBST: Brandon, when you"

642,00:37:44.54,00:37:44.54,>> It's a lot more difficultthan I anticipated.
643,00:37:48.75,00:37:48.75,The hardest part is justifyingwhy you voted them out.
644,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,Everything comes intoconsideration.
645,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,"You're like, okay, okay, I madealliances, and this person is"
646,00:37:57.04,00:37:57.04,"not my alliance, got to votethem out."

648,00:38:02.00,00:38:02.00,"may not be as deserving to stayin this game, I mean, really"
649,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,shouldn't you keep the personthat is deserving?
650,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,">> PROBST: Danni, did youanticipate this dilemma of"
651,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50,"""deserving"" because of how theyplay versus ""deserving"" because"

654,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,game.But giving your word and keeping
655,00:38:25.75,00:38:25.75,it sometimes is going to be hardin this game.
