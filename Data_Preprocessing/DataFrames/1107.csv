14,00:00:38.17,00:00:38.17,ankle injury. Amy is hurt.
15,00:00:41.17,00:00:41.17,And tempers flared when Jamie and Bobby Jon squared off.

25,00:01:15.62,00:01:15.62,were also at risk. >> Amy and Brian are probably in
26,00:01:18.12,00:01:18.12,the biggest threat of getting voted off.
27,00:01:21.42,00:01:21.42,"You know, they are probably the physically weaker players."
28,00:01:24.42,00:01:24.42,>> PROBST: Over at Nakum the tribe indulged.
29,00:01:27.25,00:01:27.25,>> I've never had a hamburger taste like this.

32,00:01:33.17,00:01:33.17,">> Rafe, you sure you don't want that beer?"
33,00:01:34.67,00:01:34.67,">> There's only two beers left. >> I definitely got one coming,"
34,00:01:36.83,00:01:36.83,without a doubt. >> Judd's got to watch his
35,00:01:38.79,00:01:38.79,"mouth. He gets so pumped up, and his"
36,00:01:41.04,00:01:41.04,mouth works before his brain does.
37,00:01:44.75,00:01:44.75,">> PROBST: During Tribal Council, Judd turned up the heat"
38,00:01:48.67,00:01:48.67,when he attacked Margaret. >> Did you or did you not-- as
39,00:01:51.38,00:01:51.38,"soon as you saw me, did you tell me that I had A.D.D."
40,00:01:54.50,00:01:54.50,>> This is what it is like to try to talk to him.
41,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,>> You should just shut up. >> PROBST: Judd got his way and
42,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,Margaret was voted out of the tribe.
43,00:02:01.75,00:02:01.75,"Margaret, the tribe has spoken. Rafe sat in on Yaxha's Tribal"

49,00:03:35.62,00:03:35.62,">> Oh, God! Thank the Lord, man. Listen, I want to thank you guys"
50,00:03:38.42,00:03:38.42,"too, for, you know, my bark ain't as big as my bite, man."
51,00:03:42.17,00:03:42.17,"And that's damn true, man, you know."
52,00:03:44.42,00:03:44.42,>> We went over to Tribal Council tonight and Margaret got
53,00:03:46.96,00:03:46.96,"voted out; thank God, man. She just pushed my button, man."
54,00:03:49.79,00:03:49.79,"And she pushed it, and pushed it and pushed it, and pushed it,"
55,00:03:52.71,00:03:52.71,and kept pushing it. I couldn't take it anymore.
56,00:03:54.62,00:03:54.62,So I kind of had a little outburst and put her in her
57,00:03:57.38,00:03:57.38,"place, man. See, in the other tribe she was"
58,00:03:59.92,00:03:59.92,the mom over there. Everybody used to run around and
59,00:04:02.83,00:04:02.83,call her mom. When she didn't have that role
60,00:04:05.04,00:04:05.04,"any more, man, that just devastated her."
61,00:04:07.08,00:04:07.08,>> I'm just glad this is all over with.
62,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,">> I'm not a loose canon. I mean, I blew up; but around"
63,00:04:11.50,00:04:11.50,"camp, I never do that, man. I'm happy all day."
64,00:04:14.08,00:04:14.08,"I'm just a big teddy bear, man, you know."
65,00:04:16.42,00:04:16.42,"Hopefully, I'll be laughing my ass to the bank, and she'll"
66,00:04:19.79,00:04:19.79,"still be at home, making chicken wings or something."
67,00:04:23.04,00:04:23.04,"Somebody is going to badmouth me, man-- listen, I'm not gonna"
68,00:04:25.75,00:04:25.75,to sit there like a little wuss and take it.
69,00:04:28.08,00:04:28.08,I don't care. I ain't going to get up and hit
70,00:04:30.62,00:04:30.62,"you either, though. >> The thing is with Judd, he"
71,00:04:32.58,00:04:32.58,"has a big voice, you know, he's a big guy."
72,00:04:35.12,00:04:35.12,"So that scares a lot of people, but it doesn't make me nervous."
73,00:04:38.50,00:04:38.50,"If anything, it makes me want to keep Judd closer, because I"
74,00:04:42.17,00:04:42.17,"could take him to final, and then I would have all the votes"
75,00:04:46.12,00:04:46.12,and Judd wouldn't have any because he is going to keep
76,00:04:48.33,00:04:48.33,blowing up. >> It's so cold.
77,00:05:18.17,00:05:18.17,>> This will hurt. ( tearing sound )
78,00:05:28.12,00:05:28.12,( exhales sharply ) That really hurt.
79,00:05:33.04,00:05:33.04,">> I hurt my shoulders pushing the big ball, during the"
80,00:05:35.42,00:05:35.42,"challenge, but that's just a part of the game."
81,00:05:37.38,00:05:37.38,Everybody over here at Yaxha has these things all over them.
82,00:05:40.04,00:05:40.04,"Um, I just got a couple of bad ones, and I got one on my right"
83,00:05:42.62,00:05:42.62,shoulder right now. It is pretty bad.
84,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,"I went to take my shirt off this morning, and it was literally"
85,00:05:47.54,00:05:47.54,pasted to it. Got a long way to go in the
86,00:05:50.08,00:05:50.08,"game, so I will probably get a lot more banged up than this."
87,00:05:52.38,00:05:52.38,"So, just right now you just be tough and know that there is a"
88,00:05:55.12,00:05:55.12,gold rush waiting at the end of the rainbow.
89,00:05:57.58,00:05:57.58,">> Oh, man. That's disgusting. I don't look like that, right?"
90,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,>> They don't look like this. They look like that one right
91,00:06:06.00,00:06:06.00,there. >> They do?
92,00:06:08.21,00:06:08.21,">> Yeah. You got one on your chin, and"
93,00:06:10.08,00:06:10.08,"one right there, and then a few dots right there."
94,00:06:14.12,00:06:14.12,"It makes you look tough, I think."
95,00:06:16.46,00:06:16.46,">> Yeah, you like that? >> Oh, yeah."
96,00:06:18.04,00:06:18.04,">> All right. >> I have open, festering sores,"
97,00:06:20.58,00:06:20.58,and it sucks. I go into these challenges and
98,00:06:24.46,00:06:24.46,you completely forget about this.
99,00:06:26.75,00:06:26.75,"I probably won't even feel it. >> PROBST: Come on in, Nakum!"
100,00:06:37.71,00:06:37.71,"Yaxha, come on in! Both tribes getting their first"
101,00:06:44.29,00:06:44.29,look at the new tribes after the last Tribal Council.
102,00:06:47.21,00:06:47.21,Margaret voted out of Nakum. Brian voted out at Yaxha.
103,00:06:52.29,00:06:52.29,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
104,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,>> Yeah. >> Yes.
105,00:06:57.21,00:06:57.21,>> PROBST: Today's challenge will require team work and a lot
106,00:06:59.29,00:06:59.29,of dexterity. Four tribe members are going to
107,00:07:02.25,00:07:02.25,"wrap 30 feet of material around their bodies, and then unspool"
108,00:07:05.38,00:07:05.38,that material as they make their way down field to the finish.
109,00:07:08.96,00:07:08.96,Here is how it works: First person will move around a
110,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"pole as quickly as they can, unspooling the material off of"
111,00:07:15.42,00:07:15.42,the pole and onto their body. You'll then move to the second
112,00:07:19.04,00:07:19.04,person. You'll connect to the second
113,00:07:20.83,00:07:20.83,"person, then together the two of you will move around the pole,"
114,00:07:23.25,00:07:23.25,putting the material around both of your bodies.
115,00:07:25.71,00:07:25.71,"Then the third person, finally the fourth person."
116,00:07:28.17,00:07:28.17,So you will end up with four people wrapping material around
117,00:07:30.62,00:07:30.62,the group. Once you have all the material
118,00:07:33.04,00:07:33.04,"around all four people, you start moving down field and"
119,00:07:36.04,00:07:36.04,begin unwinding the material off of your body.
120,00:07:39.83,00:07:39.83,"Each time a person unwinds, they unclip, and head to the finish"
121,00:07:42.79,00:07:42.79,mat. There is one other person in
122,00:07:45.12,00:07:45.12,this challenge. They are the winder.
123,00:07:47.54,00:07:47.54,Their job is to assist the other four anyway they can by helping
124,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,them move around the pole or helping them keep their balance.
125,00:07:54.08,00:07:54.08,First tribe to get all five tribe members to the finish mat
126,00:07:57.29,00:07:57.29,wins a reward. Want to know what are you
127,00:07:59.88,00:07:59.88,"playing for? >> Yes, sir."
128,00:08:01.67,00:08:01.67,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Well, the Maya are"
129,00:08:03.33,00:08:03.33,"credited with a few things. Relationship with the stars,"
130,00:08:06.08,00:08:06.08,"accounting system, Mayan calendar, but there is one big"
131,00:08:08.29,00:08:08.29,discovery you might not be familiar with: the Maya
132,00:08:12.58,00:08:12.58,discovered chocolate. Most would agree it might be
133,00:08:16.92,00:08:16.92,their biggest discovery. Today you are playing for
134,00:08:19.83,00:08:19.83,"chocolate. >> Oh, my God."
135,00:08:22.96,00:08:22.96,">> PROBST: Also, the winning tribe will get a chance to take"
136,00:08:25.58,00:08:25.58,part in a zip-line canopy tour of the jungles of Guatemala.
137,00:08:30.04,00:08:30.04,You will literally glide over these jungles.
138,00:08:33.71,00:08:33.71,"When you're finished, chocolate feast awaits you."
139,00:08:36.08,00:08:36.08,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
140,00:08:38.21,00:08:38.21,>> PROBST: Nakum you have one extra member.
141,00:08:40.17,00:08:40.17,You're sitting somebody out? >> Judd.
142,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> PROBST: Judd's going to sit this one out.
143,00:08:43.46,00:08:43.46,Give you a minute to figure out who is going to be the winder
144,00:08:45.83,00:08:45.83,"and who are going to be the four ""wind-ees."""
145,00:08:48.12,00:08:48.12,"Then we'll get started. All right, everybody is at a"
146,00:08:50.75,00:08:50.75,"pole, clipped in, ready to go. Amy is the winder for Yaxha;"
147,00:08:53.38,00:08:53.38,"Jamie, the winder for Nakum. Here we go, for a reward."
148,00:08:59.12,00:08:59.12,Survivors ready. Go!
149,00:09:05.79,00:09:05.79,Got to tag before you can start winding.

191,00:11:01.75,00:11:01.75,Nakum is unwinding. >> One more round.
192,00:11:06.46,00:11:06.46,Come on! >> PROBST: Jamie's first to hit
193,00:11:08.79,00:11:08.79,the mat. ( all shouting )
194,00:11:11.29,00:11:11.29,"Amy, you're done. Yaxha is unwinding."
195,00:11:13.92,00:11:13.92,"Working hard, making up a lot of ground."
196,00:11:16.29,00:11:16.29,Nakum seems to be slowing down. Now Yaxha is back in the lead.
197,00:11:21.04,00:11:21.04,">> Come on Yaxha. >> PROBST: Nakum, don't panic;"
198,00:11:23.79,00:11:23.79,"patience is key. Danni's out of it, heads to the"
199,00:11:27.38,00:11:27.38,finish. Cindy is out of it.
200,00:11:30.04,00:11:30.04,Nakum takes a tumble. Bobby Jon is out.
201,00:11:35.58,00:11:35.58,"Nakum panicking, cannot get up. >> Come on!"
202,00:11:39.21,00:11:39.21,>> PROBST: Gary and Brandon with a big lead for Yaxha now.
203,00:11:42.04,00:11:42.04,Nakum really falling behind. Gary unclipped.
204,00:11:45.54,00:11:45.54,"Rafe right behind, not giving up."
205,00:11:48.25,00:11:48.25,Brandon is the last one! >> Come on!
206,00:11:53.21,00:11:53.21,Yeah! >> PROBST: Yaxha wins reward!
207,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,"( cheering ) Yaxha, good work."
208,00:12:07.00,00:12:07.00,You remained calm. Big reward.
209,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,"Chocolate, zip-line canopy tour. You are leaving from here, going"
210,00:12:12.83,00:12:12.83,"to that right now. Nakum, flip side: you fell down;"
211,00:12:17.38,00:12:17.38,you couldn't get up; you guys panicked.
212,00:12:19.54,00:12:19.54,I got nothing for you. Head on back to camp.
213,00:12:38.79,00:12:38.79,>> This is crazy. >> I'm afraid of heights.
214,00:12:41.92,00:12:41.92,>> We won a reward challenge today.
215,00:12:44.17,00:12:44.17,"We really needed some momentum on our side, and we got it."
216,00:12:46.67,00:12:46.67,Just to get out of camp and come and do something new is just
217,00:12:49.50,00:12:49.50,amazing. >> I'm petrified right now.
218,00:12:55.17,00:12:55.17,The zip line-- you have this harness thing on.
219,00:12:58.79,00:12:58.79,You buckle into this big cable. Jump.
220,00:13:01.38,00:13:01.38,"And you're up high, which, of course, I'm afraid of heights."
221,00:13:04.25,00:13:04.25,What happens if I get stuck in the middle?
222,00:13:06.00,00:13:06.00,>> You won't. >> I won't?
223,00:13:08.08,00:13:08.08,">> No. >> You're just hanging there,"
224,00:13:10.33,00:13:10.33,and you just have all your confidence in the cable line.
225,00:13:13.00,00:13:13.00,"It's a little frightening. >> I'm going alone, right?"
226,00:13:17.25,00:13:17.25,>> You got it. ( crying )
227,00:13:23.08,00:13:23.08,"You're good. >> Oh, my God."
228,00:13:26.00,00:13:26.00,I can't believe this. >> There you go.
229,00:13:29.08,00:13:29.08,Yeah. Woo!
230,00:13:35.12,00:13:35.12,Woo! ( monkey howling )
231,00:13:40.12,00:13:40.12,"Oh, my God! >> Way to go, Amy!"
232,00:13:45.62,00:13:45.62,">> Oh, my gosh. >> Freakin' get me there!"
233,00:13:50.25,00:13:50.25,">> Whoo! >> Good job, Amy."
234,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,">> Yeah! >> Oh, my God, are we done?"
235,00:13:54.88,00:13:54.88,"An unbelievable experience. But probably, for me, just a"
236,00:13:57.92,00:13:57.92,"once-in-a-lifetime experience. >> Yeah, Bobby Jon."
237,00:14:04.46,00:14:04.46,">> We got to swing through the jungle on these cables, and it"
238,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,"felt just, just majestic... Going through the jungle, the"
239,00:14:15.21,00:14:15.21,wind hitting your face and just looking at all these tall plants
240,00:14:17.75,00:14:17.75,and trees and stuff. Woo!
241,00:14:22.29,00:14:22.29,"That stuff I see in the movies, you know?"
242,00:14:24.58,00:14:24.58,I've never done anything like that in my entire life before.
243,00:14:26.67,00:14:26.67,"I'll probably never do it again. >> Oh, man, this is going to be"
244,00:14:37.08,00:14:37.08,cool. >> Woo!
245,00:14:42.83,00:14:42.83,"Woo! >> Oh, man!"
246,00:14:46.21,00:14:46.21,">> Man, I had no idea that you could even do that."
247,00:14:48.67,00:14:48.67,Just flying through the air and...
248,00:14:50.46,00:14:50.46,"God, it was so cool. My God!"
249,00:14:59.50,00:14:59.50,"Holy cow, man! ( laughter )"
250,00:15:03.21,00:15:03.21,"Look at all that stuff. Oh, my God."
251,00:15:08.08,00:15:08.08,At the end of the zip line was the most chocolate I've ever
252,00:15:10.79,00:15:10.79,"seen in my life. I mean, it was a chocolate-fest."
253,00:15:13.25,00:15:13.25,"Cake, pralines, cookies, strawberries-- I mean, you name"
254,00:15:17.38,00:15:17.38,"it, it was there. Cheers on a good win today."
255,00:15:20.33,00:15:20.33,">> Yes, absolutely. Great win."
256,00:15:22.25,00:15:22.25,">> Momentum. >> Oh, my God, cherries!"
257,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,">> Holy cow, man. That's a good piece of cake."
258,00:15:31.08,00:15:31.08,">> So much chocolate. >> Man, I pigged out."
259,00:15:34.29,00:15:34.29,"I mean, I have never pigged out on chocolate that much,"
260,00:15:38.25,00:15:38.25,ever. Just looking at the muddy
261,00:15:40.12,00:15:40.12,"ground-- 'cause it looks, you know, like chocolate almost a"
262,00:15:42.58,00:15:42.58,little bit-- makes me a little bit sick.
263,00:15:45.04,00:15:45.04,So do we want to try and take all this or just?
264,00:15:48.25,00:15:48.25,>> Take the whole thing. >> Yeah.
265,00:15:50.67,00:15:50.67,>> I'm going to remember today for two reasons.
266,00:15:54.08,00:15:54.08,"The day I went rip-cording through a jungle, and the day"
267,00:15:56.62,00:15:56.62,that I ate the most chocolate I have ever eaten in my entire
268,00:16:00.54,00:16:00.54,"life. >> God, I hope I hold that down."
269,00:16:15.29,00:16:15.29,>> What do you guys want to play?
270,00:16:18.25,00:16:18.25,>> We'll play UNO. >> I always try to do like
271,00:16:20.54,00:16:20.54,different things around camp that will help us have fun and
272,00:16:23.25,00:16:23.25,pass time. King is reverse.
273,00:16:25.17,00:16:25.17,Queen is skip. We picked all these little
274,00:16:27.33,00:16:27.33,leaves from the tree and then painted four different suits and
275,00:16:30.88,00:16:30.88,"all the cards, so it made a deck of 52 cards, with even two"
276,00:16:34.17,00:16:34.17,jokers. >> The stems are the bottom of
277,00:16:36.46,00:16:36.46,"the cards, Amy. >> Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
278,00:16:53.08,00:16:53.08,">> Today happens to be my birthday, so we thought we'd go"
279,00:16:55.33,00:16:55.33,over and invite Nakum over for a little pool party.
280,00:17:06.33,00:17:06.33,">> Skip me? >> No, it skipped you and me."
281,00:17:09.25,00:17:09.25,>> Skip to me. >> Nakum!
282,00:17:15.08,00:17:15.08,"Nakum! >> Guys, I think the other tribe"
283,00:17:17.38,00:17:17.38,is coming to visit. >> I think the other tribe is
284,00:17:19.42,00:17:19.42,here. >> They yelled it twice.
285,00:17:21.54,00:17:21.54,">> I heard ""Nakum."" You guys going down there?"
286,00:17:23.88,00:17:23.88,">> Yeah, let's go. >> Nakum!"
287,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,>> That is them. That's them.
288,00:17:27.96,00:17:27.96,>> Probably out there on the boat.
289,00:17:29.58,00:17:29.58,>> Why are they coming here? There is nothing to do here.
290,00:17:31.25,00:17:31.25,">> I don't know, maybe they came to invite us to their pool."
291,00:17:33.25,00:17:33.25,>> I ain't going to their pool. >> These are our enemies at this
292,00:17:35.42,00:17:35.42,"point. >> Yeah, but this has never"
293,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"happened. >> We were like, should we go?"
294,00:17:39.04,00:17:39.04,"I was like, yeah, let's walk down."
295,00:17:40.42,00:17:40.42,"And then Jamie started saying, I think it's a bad idea."
296,00:17:42.62,00:17:42.62,"I don't think we should do this. I was like, guys, what's the"
297,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,worst thing that is going to happen?
298,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,">> Oh, there they are. >> Yo!"
299,00:17:54.96,00:17:54.96,>> Judd the stud. >> Hi!
300,00:17:57.08,00:17:57.08,"It's my birthday, so we figured we would invite you all over for"
301,00:17:59.50,00:17:59.50,"a pool party. >> Oh, what are you guys up to,"
302,00:18:01.83,00:18:01.83,man? >> What's going on?
303,00:18:03.62,00:18:03.62,>> We just wanted to come show some love.
304,00:18:13.08,00:18:13.08,>> We have a few little bitty birthday treats.
305,00:18:16.46,00:18:16.46,">> I'll go. >> All right, let's get on."
306,00:18:18.71,00:18:18.71,">> Come on, let's go. Let's get our boat."
307,00:18:21.25,00:18:21.25,"Man, let's have a party. Danni's birthday today, man."
308,00:18:23.21,00:18:23.21,>> We really just wanted to have a party.
309,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,"I mean, we have been here 17 days now, and I'm always big on"
310,00:18:27.21,00:18:27.21,"birthday parties, so we had to do something."
311,00:18:39.08,00:18:39.08,">> I don't like these people, so I don't understand why we're"
312,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"going over to hang out. >> I'm with you, man."
313,00:18:42.75,00:18:42.75,>> I'm right there with you. >> I didn't want to go.
314,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,I thought it was stupid. It's a long way.
315,00:18:50.46,00:18:50.46,"It's hot, and I just found it unnecessary."
316,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,Why should we go and hang out with the people that we want to
317,00:18:55.75,00:18:55.75,"get rid of? But, you know, I have to show an"
318,00:18:58.42,00:18:58.42,"interest in what the tribe wants to do, so I went."
319,00:19:01.83,00:19:01.83,">> Amy, hey, how you doing? >> This is nice."
320,00:19:04.83,00:19:04.83,">> What's up, guys? >> That's nice."
321,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,">> How you doing? >> What's up, man?"
322,00:19:10.46,00:19:10.46,>> You guys should sleep out there.
323,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,>> We thought about it. >> We've got some chocolate.
324,00:19:14.62,00:19:14.62,">> Oh, my gosh. >> How do you have extra"
325,00:19:17.12,00:19:17.12,chocolate? >> Are you serious?
326,00:19:19.42,00:19:19.42,">> Thank you. Oh, my..."
327,00:19:22.04,00:19:22.04,>> Happy birthday. Thank you.
328,00:19:23.71,00:19:23.71,>> How old are you? >> This is all for us?
329,00:19:26.50,00:19:26.50,">> Oh, thank you guys so much. >> Oh, my God, the chocolate."
330,00:19:30.25,00:19:30.25,"Like, that was the main reason I was coming."
331,00:19:32.71,00:19:32.71,They said they had chocolate for us.
332,00:19:34.54,00:19:34.54,"I was like, hell, yeah, I will go in your pool, and I'll eat"
333,00:19:36.88,00:19:36.88,your chocolate. It was unreal.
334,00:19:38.88,00:19:38.88,>> Unbelievable. >> That is so good.
335,00:19:45.71,00:19:45.71,>> Aah! Man! >> Thank you for the invitation.
336,00:19:56.58,00:19:56.58,>> Absolutely. >> Today is just about a
337,00:19:58.96,00:19:58.96,fellowship. We're coming together.
338,00:20:00.88,00:20:00.88,"I mean, the chief of the tribes in ancient Mayan times would go"
339,00:20:03.54,00:20:03.54,and communicate with each other. They would sit and they would
340,00:20:07.12,00:20:07.12,"smoke, and they would be at war later on."
341,00:20:10.12,00:20:10.12,>> This is like heaven. I would just sit here all day.
342,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,">> We're not getting out until we leave, man."
343,00:20:14.21,00:20:14.21,>> Woo! This is paradise.
344,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,>> How old is your oldest brother?
345,00:20:18.33,00:20:18.33,Mine is 39. >> I was being quiet.
346,00:20:20.42,00:20:20.42,"I was figuring everybody out, whether Amy and Gary were with"
347,00:20:22.83,00:20:22.83,"them, or were they waiting for a merge to try and get back with"
348,00:20:25.62,00:20:25.62,us. I was worried that maybe
349,00:20:27.96,00:20:27.96,Stephanie was getting along too well with other people.
350,00:20:30.00,00:20:30.00,"Maybe she would, you know, form bonds there."
351,00:20:32.08,00:20:32.08,"I'm here for business, and everyone else should be also."
352,00:20:34.58,00:20:34.58,>> We can go now. >> Thanks for having us.
353,00:20:40.88,00:20:40.88,">> Thank you so much for the chocolate, you guys."
354,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,">> Thank you for inviting us. >> Bye, guys."
355,00:20:45.58,00:20:45.58,">> Thank you so much. Jamie is like, hey guys, are you"
356,00:20:48.17,00:20:48.17,"guys ready? Out of nowhere. He's like, I think we should"
357,00:20:50.17,00:20:50.17,"leave soon, and he's like, no, I kind of want to go now."
358,00:20:53.04,00:20:53.04,>> You are so shady. >> You are like the shadiest
359,00:20:56.54,00:20:56.54,person. >> My being quiet?
360,00:20:58.92,00:20:58.92,">> Yeah. >> Well, I don't care."
361,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,"I'll like those people after this game is over, you know."
362,00:21:03.46,00:21:03.46,"I think we stayed too long, because it's getting way too"
363,00:21:08.25,00:21:08.25,"friendly over here. It's kind of making me sick,"
364,00:21:10.54,00:21:10.54,they were all getting along so well.
365,00:21:12.88,00:21:12.88,">> I'm still sticking to the game plan we got, though."
366,00:21:14.96,00:21:14.96,">> Well, we have to. >> No, I'm not going to stick to"
367,00:21:17.04,00:21:17.04,the game plan because we went to a pool party.
368,00:21:18.96,00:21:18.96,">> Hey, y'all can vote my ass out if you all want to."
369,00:21:21.25,00:21:21.25,">> Jamie, what is wrong with you?"
370,00:21:23.29,00:21:23.29,">> You said I was being shady. >> You are, I think you are"
371,00:21:25.79,00:21:25.79,"losing it in Guatemala. >> Jamie sometimes, like, freaks"
372,00:21:28.00,00:21:28.00,me out. I just don't understand where
373,00:21:29.54,00:21:29.54,the kid's head is at sometimes. I'm not going to back down to
374,00:21:31.58,00:21:31.58,somebody like him. So there could be a clashblac

376,00:22:00.75,00:22:00.75,>> These things are eating this stuff.
377,00:22:06.67,00:22:06.67,I almost caught one in my mouth. >> I think we're going to win
378,00:22:15.12,00:22:15.12,immunity because we have good momentum.
379,00:22:17.08,00:22:17.08,"And you know what, when we win immunity, we could have options."
380,00:22:19.88,00:22:19.88,"If we don't win immunity, we're going to have to be for"

382,00:22:24.62,00:22:24.62,"Those three are tight. >> Right now, there's five of us"

384,00:22:30.25,00:22:30.25,"and then Amy and myself, who was originally Yaxha."
385,00:22:33.54,00:22:33.54,"So Brandon, Danni and Bobby Jon I think were tight when they"
386,00:22:36.75,00:22:36.75,came over here. They might be leaning towards
387,00:22:38.79,00:22:38.79,Amy. So Amy is vulnerable if we lose
388,00:22:40.92,00:22:40.92,our next immunity. >> If we don't freakin' win
389,00:22:42.96,00:22:42.96,"immunity, right... I'll be honest, I'm not going to"
390,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,"lie about anything, I'm just going to sell myself."

401,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,">> I'm going to beat you... 'cause, I don't care."

406,00:23:28.08,00:23:28.08,I'm going to kick his ass. >> Let's just not lose the
407,00:23:32.29,00:23:32.29,"immunity, so you don't have to cut my throat."
408,00:23:34.92,00:23:34.92,I'm trying to keep a straight face.

410,00:23:39.42,00:23:39.42,"read people so well. But, uh, she'll never find Gary"
411,00:23:41.88,00:23:41.88,Hawkins in Grand Haven because there is no such thing as a Gary
412,00:23:43.83,00:23:43.83,Hawkins in Grand Haven. So she could be searching for

433,00:25:07.21,00:25:07.21,test your ability to work together as a team while solving
434,00:25:10.04,00:25:10.04,a puzzle. Here is how it will work:
435,00:25:13.00,00:25:13.00,Three members from each tribe are responsible for retrieving
436,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,giant puzzle pieces from the sand pit.

440,00:25:27.21,00:25:27.21,goes out. Each person has to make at least
441,00:25:29.46,00:25:29.46,"one attempt. After that, go in any order you"
442,00:25:32.25,00:25:32.25,choose. Once you have collected all 12
443,00:25:36.08,00:25:36.08,"pieces, two different tribe members will race to assemble"
444,00:25:39.04,00:25:39.04,the puzzle. It resembles the Maya calendar.
445,00:25:42.21,00:25:42.21,First tribe to get it together correctly wins immunity and a

563,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,>> Is that an option? >> I don't know.
564,00:32:51.96,00:32:51.96,Not going to be asking somebody like me back.
565,00:32:54.75,00:32:54.75,>> I thought that wasn't fair at all for both of them to come
566,00:32:57.33,00:32:57.33,"back, because it's such a big advantage for the two of them."
567,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,">> The fact that you just said that, opens another door."
568,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,But we bring somebody else with us.
569,00:33:07.04,00:33:07.04,Could be Gary. >> When Danni mentioned Bobby
570,00:33:09.58,00:33:09.58,"Jon's name, I said, there is my angle."
571,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,"Nobody wants to vote anybody off, but Bobby Jon has been here"
572,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,"two times in a row, so I'm thinking if I can get Gary to do"
573,00:33:17.92,00:33:17.92,"it and then we get Danni, you know, that's my last shot,"
574,00:33:20.75,00:33:20.75,basically. >> Danni brought up Bobby Jon's
575,00:33:25.04,00:33:25.04,"name. >> Well, here's the deal."
576,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,Danni and Brandon are running the show.
577,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,">> You're right. >> Okay, and if they are looking"
578,00:33:31.92,00:33:31.92,"for loyalty, I got to show to them loyalty."
579,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,"If they decide to go with Bobby Jon, I am with them."
580,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,"Danni's your play. >> I know, but do I have you?"
581,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,">> If you got Danni, you got me. >> My angle right now is Gary."
582,00:33:45.46,00:33:45.46,"And I got to hope on Danni. Hopefully, there will be three"
583,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,"votes for Bobby Jon. It will be a miracle, but I have"
584,00:33:51.12,00:33:51.12,"had miracles in the past, so I won't be giving up on that."
585,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,( thunder rumbles ) >> This feels worse than it felt
586,00:34:06.88,00:34:06.88,"in Palau, right now. >> What, the nervousness or?"
587,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,">> I'm just so close, man, you know, but you just ain't"
588,00:34:14.54,00:34:14.54,"there, and getting close. This situation doesn't count."
589,00:34:18.71,00:34:18.71,"You know, I might get voted out tonight."
590,00:34:21.46,00:34:21.46,"I'm going to feel real, real bad off if I don't make... make the"
591,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,jury. But you know what?
592,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,"That's life, bro. >> I want to make it to the"
593,00:34:33.29,00:34:33.29,jury. To me that would be a lifelong
594,00:34:35.79,00:34:35.79,dream come true. >> Nobody gets second chances.
595,00:34:37.79,00:34:37.79,"And I have been given one, and I just don't want to blow"
596,00:34:40.79,00:34:40.79,it. ( thunder rumbles )
597,00:34:47.96,00:34:47.96,">> This is definitely the hardest decision, and I want to"
598,00:34:49.79,00:34:49.79,make sure we're all together on everything.
599,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,"Hey, cowboys. I don't want any of them to"
600,00:34:54.71,00:34:54.71,"go home. And, um... I don't know what to"
601,00:34:57.71,00:34:57.71,"do. >> God, I was... hoping it"
602,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,"wouldn't come to this, you know? >> Yeah."
603,00:35:05.71,00:35:05.71,"Bobby Jon and Stephanie had a chance to play this game before,"
604,00:35:09.79,00:35:09.79,"and none of us have. >> Yeah, like, she is probably"
605,00:35:12.83,00:35:12.83,"more deserving being here than Bobby Jon, and that's what has"
606,00:35:15.62,00:35:15.62,"been getting to me, you know? Because you form alliances and"
607,00:35:19.88,00:35:19.88,then you end up voting out people that may deserve to be
608,00:35:23.04,00:35:23.04,here more than other people that are in your alliance.
609,00:35:26.62,00:35:26.62,>> Right. >> I'm somewhat conflicted
610,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,"because here I have my alliance with Bobby Jon and everything,"
611,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,"but I believe that these other people, you know, Gary and Amy,"
612,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,"maybe, deserve to be here a little bit more than he does"
613,00:35:38.58,00:35:38.58,because he has already had his shot.
614,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,This is probably the most complicated spot I have been in
615,00:35:46.96,00:35:46.96,"the game, and it's really taking a toll on my mind."
616,00:35:51.54,00:35:51.54,"You getting that rain past us? I mean, it doesn't say in"
617,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,"Survivor rules' that you have t deceive, manipulate, cheat."
618,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,You don't even have to make alliances.
619,00:36:01.38,00:36:01.38,"You are doing this stuff, why? So you can get one step closer"
620,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,"to a million dollars, and it's like you're selling your soul or"
621,00:36:06.75,00:36:06.75,"something. >> PROBST: So, Danni, Day 18,"
622,00:36:39.62,00:36:39.62,"seven people are gone, you're still here."
623,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,It's got to feel fairly good at this point.
624,00:36:45.12,00:36:45.12,">> Well, nothing feels really good today."
625,00:36:47.12,00:36:47.12,"I mean, to have to come to Tribal Council tonight because"
626,00:36:49.79,00:36:49.79,"we've all bonded so well, it sucks."
627,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,">> PROBST: Gary, what is different today than was"
628,00:36:55.04,00:36:55.04,different the last time you guys came to Tribal Council?
629,00:36:57.79,00:36:57.79,>> I think this group that we have here is so tight just
630,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,"because the energy, the attitude and how close we have gotten"
631,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50,after competing as hard as we can and going through some tough
632,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,times and going through some great times.
633,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,">> PROBST: Amy, how would you characterize this experience so"
634,00:37:13.42,00:37:13.42,"far, 18 days in? >> This is the bomb, right here."
635,00:37:16.71,00:37:16.71,I went through things that I will never experience anywhere
636,00:37:19.79,00:37:19.79,"else, you know? You get to know these people."
637,00:37:22.50,00:37:22.50,You go through tough times and you bond together.
638,00:37:25.12,00:37:25.12,"I mean, I love these guys. >> PROBST: Brandon, when you"
639,00:37:27.38,00:37:27.38,"come to Tribal Council, you are voting someone out."
640,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,"You are sending them home. It's over, torch out, bye-bye."
641,00:37:38.88,00:37:38.88,>> As ugly as that. >> PROBST: How much more
642,00:37:41.25,00:37:41.25,difficult is that for you than you anticipated?
643,00:37:44.54,00:37:44.54,>> It's a lot more difficult than I anticipated.
644,00:37:48.75,00:37:48.75,The hardest part is justifying why you voted them out.
645,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,Everything comes into consideration.
646,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,"You're like, okay, okay, I made alliances, and this person is"
647,00:37:57.04,00:37:57.04,"not my alliance, got to vote them out."
648,00:37:59.25,00:37:59.25,"On the other hand, you think maybe a person in your alliance"
649,00:38:02.00,00:38:02.00,"may not be as deserving to stay in this game, I mean, really"
650,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,shouldn't you keep the person that is deserving?
651,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,">> PROBST: Danni, did you anticipate this dilemma of"
652,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50,"""deserving"" because of how they play versus ""deserving"" because"
653,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,"I gave them the word? >> Oh, I mean, yeah, I know that"
654,00:38:20.08,00:38:20.08,is how it goes. I feel it is just part of the
655,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,game. But giving your word and keeping
656,00:38:25.75,00:38:25.75,it sometimes is going to be hard in this game.
657,00:38:28.25,00:38:28.25,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, what do you do when you come to Tribal"
658,00:38:30.96,00:38:30.96,Council and you don't want to vote anybody out?
659,00:38:33.12,00:38:33.12,"Do you look at every person and say they are valuable, or is it"
660,00:38:36.21,00:38:36.21,"simply alliances, what is it? >> My only answer would be what"
661,00:38:39.46,00:38:39.46,"kind of deal did you make with somebody on day two, on day"
662,00:38:44.96,00:38:44.96,"three, on day four. For Bobby Jon, that's the only"
663,00:38:48.42,00:38:48.42,answer I have. I don't know about the other
664,00:38:51.08,00:38:51.08,"guys, but that's my answer. >> PROBST: Well, right or wrong,"
665,00:38:54.58,00:38:54.58,"it is time to vote. Bobby Jon, you are up."
666,00:39:09.42,00:39:09.42,">> You know, Amy, you're the strongest, most real human being"
667,00:39:12.42,00:39:12.42,"I have ever met in my entire life, my entire life."
668,00:39:16.33,00:39:16.33,"I won't ever meet anybody more real than you, ever."
669,00:39:41.17,00:39:41.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
670,00:39:54.25,00:39:54.25,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
671,00:39:56.79,00:39:56.79,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
672,00:39:59.46,00:39:59.46,immediately. I'll read the votes.
673,00:40:02.54,00:40:02.54,"First vote, Amy. Bobby Jon."
674,00:40:10.75,00:40:10.75,One vote: Amy; one vote: Bobby Jon.
675,00:40:15.17,00:40:15.17,Amy-- that's two Amy. >> Eighth person voted out of
676,00:40:23.21,00:40:23.21,Survivor: Guatemala: Amy. That's three and that's enough.
677,00:40:27.04,00:40:27.04,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Play cool, guys."
678,00:40:39.62,00:40:39.62,">> PROBST: Amy, the tribe has spoken."
679,00:40:43.25,00:40:43.25,"Time for you to go. Well, I am convinced after"
680,00:40:59.21,00:40:59.21,tonight's Tribal Council that you really have become a close
681,00:41:02.38,00:41:02.38,"group, and, hopefully, that will help you because you are about"
682,00:41:06.00,00:41:06.00,to embark on a new challenge. The four of you will not go back
683,00:41:10.38,00:41:10.38,to your camp. You will go directly to Nakum's
684,00:41:12.75,00:41:12.75,camp. You and Nakum are no longer two
685,00:41:15.67,00:41:15.67,tribes; you're going to merge into one new tribe.
686,00:41:19.79,00:41:19.79,"All of your personal items, all the rewards you've won will be"
687,00:41:22.96,00:41:22.96,relocated. These are your new buffs.
688,00:41:25.71,00:41:25.71,"You guys are responsible for taking these buffs, delivering"
689,00:41:28.08,00:41:28.08,"them, handing them out. And the ten of you need to"
690,00:41:31.29,00:41:31.29,decide on a new tribe name. Whole new game.
691,00:41:34.62,00:41:34.62,"Grab your torches, head out. Good night."
