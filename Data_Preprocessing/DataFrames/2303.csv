444,00:13:06.80,00:13:06.80,YOU HAVE HANTZ ON YOUR ARM.
445,00:13:08.07,00:13:08.07,I FEEL LIKE NOBODY NOTICED THAT.
446,00:13:09.67,00:13:09.67,MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO COVER
447,00:13:10.67,00:13:10.67,HIS TRACKS BEFORE HE MAKES THEM.
448,00:13:13.13,00:13:13.13,BUT I DON'T TRUST HIM.
449,00:13:14.23,00:13:14.23,I THINK HE'S A SNEAK.
450,00:13:16.70,00:13:16.70,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS
451,00:13:18.07,00:13:18.07,PROBLEM IS WITH ME.
452,00:13:19.27,00:13:19.27,WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?
453,00:13:23.93,00:13:23.93,I'M BRANDON HANTZ.
454,00:13:26.03,00:13:26.03,I'M ME.
455,00:13:26.63,00:13:26.63,I LOVE GOD.
456,00:13:27.80,00:13:27.80,"I LOVE JESUS CHRIST, AND I"
457,00:13:29.40,00:13:29.40,SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF THE FACT
458,00:13:31.40,00:13:31.40,THAT I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON THAN
459,00:13:33.23,00:13:33.23,MY UNCLE.
460,00:13:35.13,00:13:35.13,I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE
461,00:13:36.03,00:13:36.03,"I DID IT, BUT I WAS REALLY"
462,00:13:40.27,00:13:40.27,"CONFLICTED, MAN."
463,00:13:41.50,00:13:41.50,"HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY,"
464,00:13:42.80,00:13:42.80,MAN.
465,00:13:43.50,00:13:43.50,I COMMEND YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
466,00:13:44.77,00:13:44.77,I REALLY DO.
467,00:13:45.47,00:13:45.47,"TRUST ME, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO"
468,00:13:46.63,00:13:46.63,BEEF WITH YOU WHATSOEVER.
469,00:13:47.60,00:13:47.60,THANK YOU.
470,00:13:49.10,00:13:49.10,BRANDON TOLD THE TRIBE THAT
471,00:13:51.13,00:13:51.13,HE WAS RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.
472,00:13:53.27,00:13:53.27,"A MISTAKE, IN MY OPINION, BUT HE"
473,00:13:54.97,00:13:54.97,NEED TO GET IT OFF HIS CHEST
474,00:13:57.37,00:13:57.37,"AND, YOU KNOW, THAT SHOWS"
475,00:13:59.37,00:13:59.37,BRANDON'S AGE A LITTLE BIT.
476,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,HE LETS THINGS GET TO HIM THAT
477,00:14:02.57,00:14:02.57,CAN WEIGH HIM DOWN.
478,00:14:03.37,00:14:03.37,"IT'S NOT A COOL THING, MAN."
479,00:14:04.70,00:14:04.70,"WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,"
480,00:14:06.40,00:14:06.40,"MANIPULATION IS MANIPULATION, NO"
481,00:14:07.27,00:14:07.27,MATTER HOW YOU COAT IT.
482,00:14:09.70,00:14:09.70,IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M
483,00:14:13.27,00:14:13.27,"MANIPULATING YOU, IF I'M NOT"
484,00:14:14.97,00:14:14.97,"MANIPULATING YOU, IF I'M"
485,00:14:17.53,00:14:17.53,MANIPULATING EVERYBODY ELSE.
486,00:14:18.37,00:14:18.37,RIGHT.
487,00:14:19.10,00:14:19.10,BRANDON IS A VALUABLE OF THE
488,00:14:21.23,00:14:21.23,SENATE MY ALLIANCE.
489,00:14:22.17,00:14:22.17,"I STILL TRUST BRANDON,"
490,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87,ABSOLUTELY.
491,00:14:24.60,00:14:24.60,BUT IT'S JUST MAYBE NOT IN WITH
492,00:14:25.63,00:14:25.63,BOTH FEET NOW.
493,00:14:26.27,00:14:26.27,I KIND OF HAD A RELAPSE OF
494,00:14:28.10,00:14:28.10,WHAT MY UNCLE USED TO DO AND IT
495,00:14:29.73,00:14:29.73,SUCKED.
496,00:14:35.40,00:14:35.40,"BEST ONE YET, I THINK."
497,00:14:40.60,00:14:40.60,WE HAVE A GOOD CAMP LIFE.
498,00:14:42.37,00:14:42.37,WE HAVE FOOD.
499,00:14:43.37,00:14:43.37,WE HAVE SHELTER.
500,00:14:44.37,00:14:44.37,PEOPLE GET ALONG.
501,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,"BUT THE REALITY IS, IN EVERY"
502,00:14:48.87,00:14:48.87,"TRIBE, THERE'S A PECKING ORDER."
503,00:14:51.07,00:14:51.07,"I THINK THE MINORITY IS ME,"
504,00:14:52.80,00:14:52.80,"COCHRAN, AND DAWN."
505,00:14:53.90,00:14:53.90,"ME AND DAWN FOR AGE, AND COCHRAN"
506,00:14:56.10,00:14:56.10,BECAUSE HE JUST IS THE NERDY KID
507,00:14:58.37,00:14:58.37,NOBODY HUNG OUT WITH IN SCHOOL.
508,00:15:00.10,00:15:00.10,"SORRY, JOHN."
509,00:15:00.90,00:15:00.90,I JUST DIDN'T CLICK WITH ANYONE
510,00:15:04.00,00:15:04.00,HERE.
511,00:15:04.47,00:15:04.47,I DON'T KNOW WHY.
512,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,SO EVERY CHALLENGE IS IMPORTANT
513,00:15:07.37,00:15:07.37,TO ME.
514,00:15:08.10,00:15:08.10,I AM NOT SAFE AT ALL.
515,00:15:09.17,00:15:09.17,"YEAH, BABY."
516,00:15:10.50,00:15:10.50,"OZZY, THAT'S AWESOME."
517,00:15:14.23,00:15:14.23,"IT'S MYSELF, KEITH, WHITNEY,"
518,00:15:16.77,00:15:16.77,"ALLYCE, AND JIM."
519,00:15:18.57,00:15:18.57,"BUT I THINK KEITH AND I, WE"
520,00:15:19.83,00:15:19.83,"HAVE, LIKE, A SORT OF"
521,00:15:22.20,00:15:22.20,BROTHER-TYPE THING GOING ON.
522,00:15:23.73,00:15:23.73,THERE'S GOT TO BE A CERTAIN
523,00:15:24.73,00:15:24.73,POINT WHERE I HAVE TO TRUST
524,00:15:26.37,00:15:26.37,SOMEBODY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
525,00:15:27.10,00:15:27.10,"I HAVE THE IDOL, AND WHO BETTER"
526,00:15:28.97,00:15:28.97,THAN KEITH?
527,00:15:29.70,00:15:29.70,I JUST THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO
528,00:15:30.67,00:15:30.67,"BE A STRONG ALLY, AND AS FAR AS"
529,00:15:32.73,00:15:32.73,"I KNOW, HE'S REALLY TRUSTED"
530,00:15:35.77,00:15:35.77,WORTHY.
531,00:15:36.20,00:15:36.20,I HAVE THE IDOL.
532,00:15:37.23,00:15:37.23,"AW, SWEET!"
533,00:15:38.50,00:15:38.50,"LIKE I SAID, MAN, I TRUST"
534,00:15:41.20,00:15:41.20,"YOU, AND I--"
535,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,I HOPE SO.
536,00:15:43.03,00:15:43.03,"I MEAN, I TRUST YOU."
537,00:15:43.97,00:15:43.97,"IF I DIDN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE"
538,00:15:45.37,00:15:45.37,SAID ANYTHING.
539,00:15:51.53,00:15:51.53,OSSIE FOUND IT.
540,00:15:52.43,00:15:52.43,YOU'RE SURE?

546,00:16:00.60,00:16:00.60,YUP.
547,00:16:03.50,00:16:03.50,I'M KIND OF SURPRISED HE TOLD
548,00:16:06.27,00:16:06.27,YOU.
549,00:16:06.93,00:16:06.93,HE HAS TO TELL ME BECAUSE IT
550,00:16:08.83,00:16:08.83,GIVES HIM ALL THE POWER.
551,00:16:09.87,00:16:09.87,RIGHT.
552,00:16:12.03,00:16:12.03,I'M MAD THAT OZZY HAS THE
553,00:16:14.27,00:16:14.27,IDOL BECAUSE IT GIVES HIM ALL
554,00:16:15.70,00:16:15.70,THE POWER-- OR MOST OF THE POWER
555,00:16:17.43,00:16:17.43,"RIGHT NOW PUP KNOW, IT GIVES HIM"
556,00:16:19.07,00:16:19.07,THE BETTER HOLDS ON THE
557,00:16:20.67,00:16:20.67,ALLIANCE.
558,00:16:21.37,00:16:21.37,SO I TOLD WHITNEY BECAUSE I WANT

562,00:16:29.70,00:16:29.70,BECAUSE I THOUGHT OZZY MIGHT BE
563,00:16:31.03,00:16:31.03,MAKING A MOVE.
564,00:16:31.73,00:16:31.73,YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT
565,00:16:33.27,00:16:33.27,HE DOESN'T KNOW THEY TOLD YOU.
566,00:16:34.43,00:16:34.43,"RIGHT, OKAY."
567,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,AND IT'S GOT TO BE LIKE HARD.
568,00:16:45.30,00:16:45.30,"HEY, BRANDON, YOU GOT A"
569,00:16:48.50,00:16:48.50,"MINUTE, BUD?"

582,00:17:04.20,00:17:04.20,BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
583,00:17:05.77,00:17:05.77,THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
584,00:17:06.67,00:17:06.67,IT WAS.
585,00:17:07.37,00:17:07.37,IT REALLY WAS.
586,00:17:09.47,00:17:09.47,AND I MADE THAT 19 TO EVERYBODY.
587,00:17:12.20,00:17:12.20,WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?
588,00:17:13.43,00:17:13.43,JUST THE ATTITUDE.

590,00:17:16.87,00:17:16.87,THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IS

592,00:17:19.73,00:17:19.73,TO GET THE FACT THAT I'M
593,00:17:21.33,00:17:21.33,APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

597,00:17:26.33,00:17:26.33,PEOPLE DIDN'T TRUST YOU.
598,00:17:27.93,00:17:27.93,MIKAYLA WAS COMING AT ME LIKE A

601,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,"HEY, GUYS, CAN WE GATHER AROUND"
602,00:17:34.50,00:17:34.50,FOR A SECOND?
603,00:17:35.50,00:17:35.50,"BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, I'M SUPPOSED"
604,00:17:37.70,00:17:37.70,TO BE MEEK.
605,00:17:38.40,00:17:38.40,I'M SUPPOSED TO TURN THE OTHER

610,00:17:43.07,00:17:43.07,AND SHE WALKED UP TO ME THE WAY
611,00:17:44.33,00:17:44.33,"SHE DID, I WAS VERY UPSET."
612,00:17:45.87,00:17:45.87,WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO
613,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,"HER, SHE'S WONDERING WHY I WANT"
614,00:17:48.73,00:17:48.73,"TO VOTE HER OUT, OKAY."
615,00:17:49.93,00:17:49.93,AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK
616,00:17:51.10,00:17:51.10,AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REALLY
617,00:17:52.87,00:17:52.87,LOYAL AND WHO IS REALLY NOT
618,00:17:54.60,00:17:54.60,BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOU
619,00:17:56.33,00:17:56.33,"DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN ALLIANCE,"
620,00:17:58.90,00:17:58.90,PERIOD.
621,00:17:59.57,00:17:59.57,ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING TO SAY?
622,00:18:06.70,00:18:06.70,I DON'T WANT NO MORE OF THIS
623,00:18:08.27,00:18:08.27,FROM EVERYBODY.
624,00:18:10.43,00:18:10.43,I-- JUST RESPECT THAT FROM ME.
625,00:18:12.27,00:18:12.27,KEEP ME OUT OF THE DRAMA.
626,00:18:16.10,00:18:16.10,THERE YOU GO.
627,00:18:19.57,00:18:19.57,THAT'S IT.
628,00:18:24.00,00:18:24.00,"GOD, OH, MY GOD."
629,00:18:25.77,00:18:25.77,I WAS IN SO MUCH SHOCK.
630,00:18:26.77,00:18:26.77,WE ALL DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AFTER
631,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,THAT.
632,00:18:28.40,00:18:28.40,HE SAY LOOSE CANNON AND THERE'S
633,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,A LOT OF TENSION BETWEEN BRENDAN
634,00:18:31.00,00:18:31.00,AND MIKAYLA INSPECT HIS BIBLICAL
635,00:18:35.60,00:18:35.60,TERMS HE'D PROBABLY CALL HER THE
636,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,WHORE OF BABYLON.
637,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33,"I THINK BRANDON RIGHT NOW, HE'S"
638,00:18:40.87,00:18:40.87,TORN BETWEEN FOLLOWING WHATEVER
639,00:18:44.00,00:18:44.00,"CRAZY BELIEFS HE HAS, AND YET AT"
640,00:18:45.70,00:18:45.70,THE SAME TIME HE INHERENTLY IN
641,00:18:47.13,00:18:47.13,HIS BLOOD LINE IS A DEVIOUS
642,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,JERK.
643,00:19:00.53,00:19:00.53,I WAS TOLD BY MY POP ABY MY
644,00:19:03.27,00:19:03.27,"DAD, DO NOT LOSE YOUR TEMPER."
645,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,AND IT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
646,00:19:08.70,00:19:08.70,"BEING ACARINE, I SHOULDN'T HAVE"
647,00:19:09.70,00:19:09.70,LOST MY TEMPER.
648,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
649,00:19:11.27,00:19:11.27,CONTROL MYSELF AND I DIDN'T.
650,00:19:12.50,00:19:12.50,I FAILED.
651,00:19:16.53,00:19:16.53,I JUST LET MY FLESH GET AHOLE OF
652,00:19:18.83,00:19:18.83,ME.
653,00:19:19.53,00:19:19.53,"I MEAN, I STRUGGLE EVERY DAY."

1130,00:34:18.20,00:34:18.20,LET'S PROTECT AGAINST THAT.
1131,00:34:19.17,00:34:19.17,THE PLAN MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE.
