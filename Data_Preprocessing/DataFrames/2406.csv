616,00:18:40.37,00:18:40.37,IS SAYING IS REALLY TRUE BECAUSE
617,00:18:42.07,00:18:42.07,I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

633,00:19:07.73,00:19:07.73,THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
634,00:19:11.70,00:19:11.70,PERFECT.
635,00:19:13.07,00:19:13.07,I'VE BEEN STANDING HERETO WHOLE

692,00:20:55.23,00:20:55.23,I GAVE HIM SOME WATER.
693,00:20:56.37,00:20:56.37,HE MIGHT HAVE A TENSION
694,00:20:58.40,00:20:58.40,HEADACHE.
695,00:20:58.77,00:20:58.77,"IT SCARED ME WHEN I WOKE UP,"
696,00:21:00.63,00:21:00.63,I THOUGHT MY BRAIN-- LIKE

704,00:21:14.83,00:21:14.83,AND I GOT THIS PAIN AND IT WAS
705,00:21:17.43,00:21:17.43,LIKE SOMEBODY HAD A KNIFE
706,00:21:18.90,00:21:18.90,CUTTING FROM MY BELLYBUTTON OVER
707,00:21:20.50,00:21:20.50,TO MY RIGHT SIDE.

714,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,IT'S TOUGH.
715,00:21:31.37,00:21:31.37,"COLTON HAS A TENSION HEADACHE,"
716,00:21:33.37,00:21:33.37,"AND HIS STOMACH HURTS, AND IF"

722,00:21:42.63,00:21:42.63,STRATEGY GOES BECAUSE COLTON
723,00:21:43.90,00:21:43.90,WILL REALIZE THAT I AM ACTUALLY
724,00:21:45.27,00:21:45.27,A GOOD PERSON AND I'M NOT THIS
725,00:21:48.13,00:21:48.13,BAD PERSON THAT ALICIA PORTRAYS
726,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,ME TO BE.
727,00:21:51.37,00:21:51.37,JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST
728,00:21:52.80,00:21:52.80,RELAX.
729,00:21:53.13,00:21:53.13,I LITERALLY THOUGHT I WAS
730,00:21:54.23,00:21:54.23,ABOUT TO DIE.
731,00:21:55.63,00:21:55.63,CHRISTINA JUST KIND OF STEPPED
732,00:21:56.57,00:21:56.57,IN AND TOOK ON THIS MOTHERLY

735,00:22:02.37,00:22:02.37,AND OF COURSE CHRISTINA'S GOING
736,00:22:03.57,00:22:03.57,TO DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING
737,00:22:04.93,00:22:04.93,TO SAVE HERSELF.
738,00:22:05.90,00:22:05.90,SHE WILL LITERALLY DO WHATEVER
739,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,"SHE HAS TO, TO STAY IN THE GAME."
740,00:22:09.90,00:22:09.90,"YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD,"

756,00:22:54.90,00:22:54.90,"YEAH, YOU'RE DEHYDRATED."

758,00:22:58.37,00:22:58.37,TO SEE THAT.
759,00:22:59.03,00:22:59.03,YOU BETTER JUST FORCE YOURSELF
760,00:23:00.37,00:23:00.37,TO DRINK WATER.
761,00:23:01.03,00:23:01.03,"BECAUSE THE NEXT THING HAPPENS,"
762,00:23:02.77,00:23:02.77,"YOU GET FAST HEARTBEAT,"

766,00:23:12.93,00:23:12.93,"WATER, OKAY?"
767,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13,COLTON TOLD US THAT HE WAS
768,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,"DEHYDRATED, HE HAD ABDOMINAL"
769,00:23:19.03,00:23:19.03,"PAIN, AND THAT HE HAD A"
770,00:23:21.57,00:23:21.57,HEADACHE.

772,00:23:23.03,00:23:23.03,AND I KNOW THE SIGNS OF

783,00:23:42.10,00:23:42.10,ADVANCED APPENDICITIS.
784,00:23:43.03,00:23:43.03,OR IT COULD BE TOTALLIY BENIGN.
785,00:23:45.67,00:23:45.67,"GAS, FOR INSTANCE."
786,00:23:48.47,00:23:48.47,I'LL GET MY CANTEEN.

796,00:24:16.10,00:24:16.10,IT HURTS.
797,00:24:17.37,00:24:17.37,I WALKED OFF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I
798,00:24:19.77,00:24:19.77,"HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, I"
799,00:24:21.43,00:24:21.43,CAN'T HOLD ANYTHING DOWN.

801,00:24:22.97,00:24:22.97,I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
802,00:24:24.17,00:24:24.17,"LIKE, IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE THIS"
803,00:24:26.10,00:24:26.10,"INTENSE PAIN, AND IT LITERALLY"
804,00:24:27.63,00:24:27.63,FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT A
805,00:24:28.90,00:24:28.90,KNIFE IN MY SIDE.
806,00:24:29.90,00:24:29.90,THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW
807,00:24:31.20,00:24:31.20,"TO DESCRIBE IT, IS JUST LIKE A"
808,00:24:33.20,00:24:33.20,KNIFE.
809,00:24:33.33,00:24:33.33,I'M DYING.
810,00:24:33.93,00:24:33.93,"LIKE, I AM LITERALLY ABOUT TO"
811,00:24:37.37,00:24:37.37,DIE.
812,00:24:38.40,00:24:38.40,"I SEE COLTON ON THE GROUND,"
813,00:24:39.57,00:24:39.57,"AND I AM FREAKING OUT, THINKING,"
814,00:24:42.30,00:24:42.30,"OH, MY GOD."
815,00:24:43.03,00:24:43.03,THIS IS WORSE THAN WHAT I REALLY
816,00:24:44.43,00:24:44.43,THOUGHT IT WAS.
817,00:24:45.20,00:24:45.20,"I KNEW HE WAS IN PAIN, BUT I"
818,00:24:47.07,00:24:47.07,DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH IN SEVERE

820,00:24:49.23,00:24:49.23,AND SEEING HIM ON THE GROUND
821,00:24:51.43,00:24:51.43,CRYING WAS AN INDICATOR TO ME
822,00:24:53.00,00:24:53.00,THAT HE NEEDS MEDICAL NEED
823,00:24:56.83,00:24:56.83,IMMEDIATELY.
824,00:24:58.70,00:24:58.70,"HI, COLTON."
825,00:25:00.13,00:25:00.13,IT'S JEFF WITH THE MEDICAL TEAM.
826,00:25:02.97,00:25:02.97,"HEY, COLTON."

838,00:25:27.93,00:25:27.93,AND THEN IT JUST GOT WORSE AND
839,00:25:29.47,00:25:29.47,WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.
840,00:25:30.80,00:25:30.80,"I TRIED TO DRINK WATER, AND I"
841,00:25:32.57,00:25:32.57,JUST STARTED PUKING.
842,00:25:33.67,00:25:33.67,"LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING"

852,00:25:44.27,00:25:44.27,AND JUST FIND OUT IF IT'S
853,00:25:47.53,00:25:47.53,SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS.
854,00:25:48.63,00:25:48.63,"IF YOU CAN, PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN"
855,00:25:50.70,00:25:50.70,BY YOUR SIDE.

861,00:26:00.23,00:26:00.23,SECONDS.
862,00:26:00.70,00:26:00.70,"I'M GOING TO PRESS IN, AND THEN"
863,00:26:02.17,00:26:02.17,I'M GOING TO LET GO SUDDENLY.
864,00:26:04.03,00:26:04.03,I WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF THE
865,00:26:06.40,00:26:06.40,PAIN'S WORSE WHEN I PRESS IN OR
866,00:26:08.53,00:26:08.53,WHEN I LET GO.
867,00:26:09.90,00:26:09.90,OKAY?
868,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23,IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL.

870,00:26:12.60,00:26:12.60,I'M GOING TO PRESS IN.

873,00:26:16.77,00:26:16.77,WHEN YOU PRESSED IN.
874,00:26:19.37,00:26:19.37,HIS HEART RATE IS 105.
875,00:26:20.93,00:26:20.93,OKAY.
876,00:26:22.60,00:26:22.60,JUST RELAX.
877,00:26:24.47,00:26:24.47,YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR KNEES BACK
878,00:26:27.17,00:26:27.17,UP?
879,00:26:27.50,00:26:27.50,Jeff: SO COLTON IT'S THE
880,00:26:28.97,00:26:28.97,PAIN THAT JUST INCREASED?
881,00:26:30.90,00:26:30.90,SO THE HEART RATE WENT UP?
882,00:26:33.70,00:26:33.70,IT'S UP TO 120 SOOON
883,00:26:37.53,00:26:37.53,INDICATIVE OF SEVERE PAIN.
884,00:26:39.13,00:26:39.13,Jeff: HOW MUCH DID IT GO
885,00:26:40.90,00:26:40.90,UP?
886,00:26:40.97,00:26:40.97,DOUBLED.
887,00:26:41.60,00:26:41.60,Jeff: HIS HEART RATE
888,00:26:43.13,00:26:43.13,DOUBLED AND YOU WERE DOING THE
889,00:26:44.73,00:26:44.73,LIGHTEST OF TOUCH.
890,00:26:45.60,00:26:45.60,LIGHTEST TOUCH.
891,00:26:47.53,00:26:47.53,SO APPENDICITIS IS A VERY LIKELY
892,00:26:49.57,00:26:49.57,"DIAGNOSIS HERE, GIVEN ALL THE"
893,00:26:51.77,00:26:51.77,SYMPTOMS.
894,00:26:52.03,00:26:52.03,"Jeff: COLTON, THE MINUTE"
895,00:26:53.07,00:26:53.07,"SHE MENTIONED APPENDICITIS, YOU"
896,00:26:55.37,00:26:55.37,STARTED GETTING EMOTIONAL.
897,00:26:55.87,00:26:55.87,I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
898,00:26:58.07,00:26:58.07,"Jeff: FIRST OF ALL, LET'S"
899,00:26:58.90,00:26:58.90,GET IT OFFICIAL.
900,00:27:00.43,00:27:00.43,"SO, RAMONA, OFFICIALLY, YOU'VE"
901,00:27:03.90,00:27:03.90,RULED OUT CONSTIPATION.
902,00:27:06.10,00:27:06.10,IT'S BEEN SEVERAL DAYS.
903,00:27:07.47,00:27:07.47,HE'S GOT SEVERE PAIN.
904,00:27:09.13,00:27:09.13,WE'VE WATCHED HIS HEARTRATE
905,00:27:10.90,00:27:10.90,DOUBLE WHEN YOU WERE TOUCHING
906,00:27:12.90,00:27:12.90,HIM.
907,00:27:13.37,00:27:13.37,CAN YOU DIAGNOSE APPENDICITIS OR
908,00:27:15.60,00:27:15.60,CAN YOU JUST DIAGNOSE IT MIGHT
909,00:27:17.30,00:27:17.30,BE?
910,00:27:17.70,00:27:17.70,IT'S TOO RISKY TO NOT TAKE
911,00:27:19.27,00:27:19.27,"HIM OUT AND INVESTIGATE IT,"
912,00:27:20.70,00:27:20.70,BECAUSE IT CAN BURST.
913,00:27:21.73,00:27:21.73,Jeff: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
914,00:27:22.73,00:27:22.73,WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM IN.
915,00:27:24.07,00:27:24.07,YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE
916,00:27:26.80,00:27:26.80,"TESTS YOU NEED TO DETERMINE,"
917,00:27:28.23,00:27:28.23,"AND, COLTON, THAT MEANS IF WE"
918,00:27:29.43,00:27:29.43,HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT AND TAKE
919,00:27:30.70,00:27:30.70,"YOU TO A HOSPITAL, YOU HAVE TO"
920,00:27:32.40,00:27:32.40,BE OUT OF THE GAME.
921,00:27:33.67,00:27:33.67,"NO, JEFF, PLEASE, DON'T,"
922,00:27:35.77,00:27:35.77,"PLEASE, JEFF."
923,00:27:36.47,00:27:36.47,I JUST WANT TO PROVE THAT I CAN
924,00:27:38.90,00:27:38.90,DO THIS.
925,00:27:41.13,00:27:41.13,I GUESS I'VE DONE MY BEST.
926,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50,I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
927,00:27:46.63,00:27:46.63,MORE.
928,00:27:49.63,00:27:49.63,Jeff: YOU STILL HAVE THE
929,00:27:51.23,00:27:51.23,IDOL?
930,00:27:51.63,00:27:51.63,YES.
931,00:27:52.07,00:27:52.07,Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
932,00:27:53.00,00:27:53.00,DO WITH IT?
933,00:27:53.87,00:27:53.87,"OH, MY GOD."
934,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,CAN I GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY?
935,00:27:58.87,00:27:58.87,Jeff: THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
936,00:28:01.80,00:28:01.80,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
937,00:28:04.03,00:28:04.03,Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO BRING
938,00:28:06.23,00:28:06.23,TRIBE OVER TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
939,00:28:08.70,00:28:08.70,"GUYS, RIGHT ON IN HERE."
940,00:28:14.43,00:28:14.43,THEY THINK I HAVE
941,00:28:17.90,00:28:17.90,APPENDICITIS.
942,00:28:18.10,00:28:18.10,APPENDICITIS?
943,00:28:19.47,00:28:19.47,IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE
944,00:28:21.03,00:28:21.03,AND WORSE.
945,00:28:22.90,00:28:22.90,DOES IT REALLY HURT REALLY
946,00:28:26.30,00:28:26.30,BAD?
947,00:28:26.43,00:28:26.43,YEAH.
948,00:28:27.07,00:28:27.07,COLTON AND I ALWAYS TALKED
949,00:28:30.47,00:28:30.47,STRATEGY 24/7.
950,00:28:31.13,00:28:31.13,THAT'S ALL WE EVER TALKED ABOUT.
951,00:28:32.90,00:28:32.90,WE PLANNED AND WE PLANNED AND WE
952,00:28:34.30,00:28:34.30,PLANNED.
953,00:28:34.70,00:28:34.70,AND IF COLTON IS OUT OF THE
954,00:28:35.90,00:28:35.90,"GAME, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT"
955,00:28:36.90,00:28:36.90,"EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT THAT PUTS ME"
956,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,IN A REALLY BAD SPOT.
957,00:28:39.73,00:28:39.73,"I MEAN, CALL ME A BAD PERSON,"
958,00:28:41.33,00:28:41.33,BUT ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS
959,00:28:43.63,00:28:43.63,STRATEGY THE WHOLE TIME.
960,00:28:44.53,00:28:44.53,"Jeff: SO THE RESULT IS,"
961,00:28:46.73,00:28:46.73,THAT COLTON IS BEING PULLED FROM
962,00:28:49.47,00:28:49.47,THE GAME.
963,00:28:49.90,00:28:49.90,OH!
964,00:28:50.50,00:28:50.50,OKAY.
965,00:28:50.93,00:28:50.93,I'M SORRY.
966,00:28:51.77,00:28:51.77,DON'T BE SORRY.
967,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,I'M SORRY.
968,00:28:55.83,00:28:55.83,"GREAT JOB, BRO."
969,00:28:57.47,00:28:57.47,DON'T BE SORRY.
970,00:28:58.97,00:28:58.97,YOU DID GREAT.
971,00:28:59.60,00:28:59.60,GREAT JOB.
972,00:29:01.33,00:29:01.33,"HE IS THE BIGGEST ""SURVIVOR"""
973,00:29:04.23,00:29:04.23,"FAN, EVER."
974,00:29:05.17,00:29:05.17,"Jeff: JONAS, YOU'RE REALLY"

976,00:29:07.17,00:29:07.17,"YEAH, I KNOW, I MEAN, LIKE,"
977,00:29:09.13,00:29:09.13,IT'S JUST-- IT JUST KILLS ME--
978,00:29:11.33,00:29:11.33,I'M JUST PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS
979,00:29:12.77,00:29:12.77,POSITION AND IF I WAS HIM I'D BE
980,00:29:15.60,00:29:15.60,"JUST HEARTBROKEN,UN."
981,00:29:17.10,00:29:17.10,Jeff: ARE THERE ANY LAST
982,00:29:19.07,00:29:19.07,WORDS BEFORE WE OFFICIALLY PULL
983,00:29:20.60,00:29:20.60,YOU FROM THIS GAME?
984,00:29:23.23,00:29:23.23,GO GET THEM.
985,00:29:24.93,00:29:24.93,"I MEAN, Y'ALL KNOW WHAT Y'ALL"
986,00:29:27.20,00:29:27.20,ARE UP AGAINST.
987,00:29:28.53,00:29:28.53,AND Y'ALL KNOW AN IDOL IS OUT OF
988,00:29:32.70,00:29:32.70,PLAY.
989,00:29:33.10,00:29:33.10,TELL SABRINA THANKS FOR THE
990,00:29:35.27,00:29:35.27,SOUVENIR.
991,00:29:35.47,00:29:35.47,I'LL LET HER KNOW.
992,00:29:36.33,00:29:36.33,"YOU KNOW WHAT, COLTON IS A"
993,00:29:39.00,00:29:39.00,SPOILED BRAT.
994,00:29:39.67,00:29:39.67,HE'S GOING TO KEEP THE IMMUNITY
995,00:29:41.13,00:29:41.13,"IDOL FOR A SOUVENIR, EVEN THOUGH"
996,00:29:42.80,00:29:42.80,"HE KNOWS HE SCREWED ME, LIKE,"
997,00:29:45.67,00:29:45.67,THE BIGGEST.
998,00:29:46.90,00:29:46.90,"Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT"
999,00:29:47.90,00:29:47.90,"A STRETCHER COMING IN, OKAY?"
1000,00:29:49.67,00:29:49.67,LET'S BRING IT IN.
1001,00:29:50.50,00:29:50.50,I VOTED OFF MONICA.
1002,00:29:52.13,00:29:52.13,"IF MONICA WAS HERE, THE GIRLS"
1003,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,"WOULD HAVE HAD THE NUMBERS, AND"
1004,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS POSITION.
1005,00:29:56.90,00:29:56.90,"SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT, SCREW HIM?"
1006,00:29:59.83,00:29:59.83,BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S IN
1007,00:30:01.07,00:30:01.07,YOUR BEST INTEREST TO GO BECAUSE
1008,00:30:02.07,00:30:02.07,YOU HAVE A LONG TRIP TO GET TO
1009,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,THE HOSPITAL.
1010,00:30:04.47,00:30:04.47,YOU'RE SO STRONG.
1011,00:30:05.83,00:30:05.83,READY?
1012,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,"ONE, TWO, THREE."
1013,00:30:11.37,00:30:11.37,THE ORIGINAL PLAN WHEN COLTON
1014,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83,WAS HERE TO GET RID OF CHRISTINA
1015,00:30:15.90,00:30:15.90,FIRST.
1016,00:30:17.07,00:30:17.07,BUT I FEEL LIKE NOW THAT I HAVE
1017,00:30:20.37,00:30:20.37,"A LITTLE MORE POWER IN THE GAME,"
1018,00:30:22.33,00:30:22.33,IT WOULD BE WISER FOR ME TO VOTE
1019,00:30:24.43,00:30:24.43,"OFF ALICIA, BECAUSE ALICIA'S GOT"
1020,00:30:26.47,00:30:26.47,MORE TIES WITH THE GIRLS.
1021,00:30:27.67,00:30:27.67,IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE
1022,00:30:31.13,00:30:31.13,ALICIA IN THE GAME.
1023,00:30:31.93,00:30:31.93,SO COLTON LEAVING IS A HUGE GAME
1024,00:30:35.57,00:30:35.57,CHANGER.
1025,00:30:35.83,00:30:35.83,"TAKE CARE, BUDDY!"
1026,00:30:37.07,00:30:37.07,I DO BELIEVE IF THERE WAS A
1027,00:30:38.93,00:30:38.93,"KARMA, COLTON GOT SOME KARMA"
1028,00:30:41.07,00:30:41.07,RIGHT BACK AT HIM.
1029,00:30:42.60,00:30:42.60,( LAUGHS )

1034,00:31:33.43,00:31:33.43,TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
1035,00:31:35.30,00:31:35.30,ALL RIGHT.
1036,00:31:36.57,00:31:36.57,ALL RIGHT.
1037,00:31:37.60,00:31:37.60,OKAY.

1039,00:31:40.27,00:31:40.27,DON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT.

1043,00:31:45.73,00:31:45.73,WOW.
1044,00:31:48.70,00:31:48.70,TREE MAIL SAID THAT BOTH
1045,00:31:50.67,00:31:50.67,TRIBES ARE GOING TO TRIBAL
1046,00:31:52.70,00:31:52.70,"COUNCIL, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY"
1047,00:31:54.63,00:31:54.63,FINGERNAILS RIGHT NOW.
1048,00:31:55.67,00:31:55.67,"LIKE, ALL THE DIRT IS IN MY"
1049,00:31:57.17,00:31:57.17,MOUTH AND IT WAS NUTRITIOUS BUT
1050,00:31:58.53,00:31:58.53,IT WAS DISGUSTING.
1051,00:31:59.73,00:31:59.73,I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.
1052,00:32:01.40,00:32:01.40,SO YOU HAVEN'T WON YET.
1053,00:32:03.37,00:32:03.37,I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
1054,00:32:05.17,00:32:05.17,CHALLENGE.
1055,00:32:05.40,00:32:05.40,TRIBAL'S A CHALLENGE.
1056,00:32:08.30,00:32:08.30,TRIBAL'S A HEADACHE.
1057,00:32:10.07,00:32:10.07,IS IT A CHALLENGE?
1058,00:32:12.93,00:32:12.93,
1059,00:32:14.07,00:32:14.07,I DON'T THINK SO.
1060,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,IT CONTINUES ON.
1061,00:32:16.33,00:32:16.33,IT'S KIND OF NEUTRAL RIGHT NOW.
1062,00:32:17.87,00:32:17.87,WHAT IF EVERYBODY GOES AND
1063,00:32:19.23,00:32:19.23,EVERYBODY PICKS ONE PERSON.
1064,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR TRIBE OR
1065,00:32:22.60,00:32:22.60,THE OTHER TRIBE.
1066,00:32:23.47,00:32:23.47,IT IS ONE WORLD.
1067,00:32:24.47,00:32:24.47,EVERYBODY PUTS A VOTE IN FOR THE
1068,00:32:26.37,00:32:26.37,ONE PERSON THEY WANT TO GO HOME.
1069,00:32:27.47,00:32:27.47,THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION.
1070,00:32:29.17,00:32:29.17,OUR TRIBE LIKES TO RUN ON AND
1071,00:32:33.23,00:32:33.23,AND AND DEVELOP THESE FANTASY
1072,00:32:35.20,00:32:35.20,THEMES WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
1073,00:32:36.43,00:32:36.43,I DON'T KNOW.
1074,00:32:38.13,00:32:38.13,WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM

1182,00:36:08.07,00:36:08.07,SOMEBODY.

1220,00:37:48.10,00:37:48.10,"I MEAN, THAT'S MY REACTION."
