2,00:00:04.90,00:00:04.90,"JEFF PROBST: Tonight, join us  for a special episode"
3,00:00:07.00,00:00:07.00," of Survivor: The Amazon,   as we take a look back"
4,00:00:10.73,00:00:10.73," at the first 27 days,  through highlights"
5,00:00:12.77,00:00:12.77, and never-before-seen footage.
6,00:00:18.27,00:00:18.27,"We're going to split it up like-like a calendar,"
7,00:00:20.63,00:00:20.63,"and day one, two, three, and we're going to make a crate..."
8,00:00:22.70,00:00:22.70,"'Cause Rob and I were the great counters,"
9,00:00:24.03,00:00:24.03,"you know, for both tribes."
10,00:00:25.20,00:00:25.20,ROB: I had been painting with Heidi.
11,00:00:28.57,00:00:28.57, This is the hottest girl  I've ever talked to.
12,00:00:30.37,00:00:30.37, She has both natural
13,00:00:32.87,00:00:32.87,and man-made beauty qualities.
14,00:00:36.10,00:00:36.10,"You know, you guys want in the cage."
15,00:00:37.57,00:00:37.57,"-Kind of going... -ROGER: Christy, uh--"
16,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77, we have made her feel good  about herself.
17,00:00:40.50,00:00:40.50,"CHRISTY: They thought,  ""Yeah, that would be cool."""
18,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53," Be lots of signs, you know."
19,00:00:44.13,00:00:44.13," They were, like,  ""We'll learn some signs."""
20,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33,"Tambaqui is a fish, so this is fish."
21,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,"That is so great that people really want to, like, learn."
22,00:00:52.90,00:00:52.90,"JEANNE: There's been a lot more,"
23,00:00:54.37,00:00:54.37,"um, noises in the jungle tonight,"
24,00:00:57.50,00:00:57.50,and I just saw something over there.
25,00:01:00.37,00:01:00.37,"HEIDI: I mean,  it's definitely an animal."
26,00:01:02.00,00:01:02.00, It's so close to our camp.
27,00:01:04.70,00:01:04.70,So I'm a little freaked out right now.
28,00:02:15.87,00:02:15.87,"PROBST: 27 days ago,  16 Americans were stranded"
29,00:02:19.97,00:02:19.97, in the middle  of the Amazonian rain forest.
30,00:02:23.30,00:02:23.30,"Immediately, the castaways were  separated into two tribes."
31,00:02:26.90,00:02:26.90,"As I call out your your name,"
32,00:02:28.30,00:02:28.30,I want you to climb down the rope ladder.
33,00:02:29.73,00:02:29.73,Jeanne. Heidi. Joanna.
34,00:02:32.87,00:02:32.87," And for the first time,  the survivors"
35,00:02:34.87,00:02:34.87, were divided  along gender lines.
36,00:02:37.47,00:02:37.47,"It is only fitting that, for the first time, while we're here"
37,00:02:39.80,00:02:39.80,"in the Amazon, we have a tribe of women versus a tribe of men."
38,00:02:43.80,00:02:43.80,(whooping and laughter)
39,00:02:44.80,00:02:44.80,DEENA:  I was absolutely just
40,00:02:46.93,00:02:46.93, overjoyed that  it was an all-female tribe.
41,00:02:48.90,00:02:48.90, It's an all-chick thing.
42,00:02:50.73,00:02:50.73,We can let our hair down.
43,00:02:52.23,00:02:52.23,We can pee in front of each other.
44,00:02:53.97,00:02:53.97,-Dave. -Dave?
45,00:02:55.20,00:02:55.20,DANIEL: All the guys  were really pumped up.
46,00:02:56.63,00:02:56.63, There is no way that women
47,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83, are going to beat us  in anything--
48,00:03:00.23,00:03:00.23,"physical, mentally."
49,00:03:01.70,00:03:01.70, We're never going  to go to Tribal Council.
50,00:03:03.80,00:03:03.80,Tribal Council-- we ain't goin' to Tribal Council.
51,00:03:05.87,00:03:05.87,JENNA:  They're so freaking cocky.
52,00:03:07.90,00:03:07.90,I just want to beat them to just kind of like shut them up.
53,00:03:11.23,00:03:11.23,PROBST: But the women  stumbled from the start.
54,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,Ryan?
55,00:03:13.60,00:03:13.60,(indistinct chatter)
56,00:03:20.60,00:03:20.60,"SHAWNA: I just couldn't even  untie a boat,"
57,00:03:23.17,00:03:23.17, and I just felt so stupid.
58,00:03:25.03,00:03:25.03,The guys going off one way.
59,00:03:26.37,00:03:26.37,The girls couldn't untie...
60,00:03:27.53,00:03:27.53,"Well, I couldn't untie the knot."
61,00:03:28.80,00:03:28.80,"PROBST: When the men arrived  at their camp,"
62,00:03:31.80,00:03:31.80, they brimmed with confidence.
63,00:03:33.23,00:03:33.23,-(whooping) -Yeah!
64,00:03:35.27,00:03:35.27,"You know, we're all... we're all friggin' men of pride,"
65,00:03:37.13,00:03:37.13,"men of honor, whatnot..."
66,00:03:38.30,00:03:38.30,(laughter)
67,00:03:39.90,00:03:39.90,"-And right now, baby... -Tell it."
68,00:03:41.47,00:03:41.47,"Yeah, we're the favorites right now."
69,00:03:43.03,00:03:43.03,PROBST:  The Tambaqui men
70,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50, aggressively began  to build their new camp.
71,00:03:50.67,00:03:50.67,I think I missed my calling in life as a lumberjack.
72,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,"PROBST: At Jaburu,  Christy revealed her secret."
73,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,"I... It's not a big deal, but I think it's something"
74,00:04:01.17,00:04:01.17,"that every tribe member should know, that I am deaf."
75,00:04:04.77,00:04:04.77,"I can't hear. I read lips. Um, night time..."
76,00:04:07.23,00:04:07.23,JANET: Christy has  a hearing disability.
77,00:04:09.17,00:04:09.17, She just asked us  to look at her
78,00:04:10.97,00:04:10.97,"and speak slowly, so she could read our lips."
79,00:04:13.90,00:04:13.90, It took us by surprise.
80,00:04:15.20,00:04:15.20,"Oh, my God."
81,00:04:16.73,00:04:16.73,"PROBST: Unlike the men,  the women struggled"
82,00:04:18.30,00:04:18.30, to get their camp  up and running.
83,00:04:19.73,00:04:19.73,(grunts)
84,00:04:21.73,00:04:21.73,We almost got it.
85,00:04:29.20,00:04:29.20,"PROBST: And unable  to read lips in the dark,"
86,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10, Christy felt like an outsider.
87,00:04:32.20,00:04:32.20,Did you notice
88,00:04:33.83,00:04:33.83,the guys stared at Heidi when they got on the boat?
89,00:04:36.00,00:04:36.00,"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
90,00:04:38.57,00:04:38.57,I'm missing out on a lot of the information.
91,00:04:41.03,00:04:41.03," I could never be like them,  because I'm not."
92,00:04:44.40,00:04:44.40, I'm always totally different;  always have been.
93,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,"(voice breaking): Just, like, I'm at a big disadvantage."
94,00:04:49.20,00:04:49.20,I'm at a big disadvantage.
95,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,(sniffles)
96,00:04:52.57,00:04:52.57,"PROBST: By day two, Roger was  already annoying people."
97,00:04:55.70,00:04:55.70,Okay?
98,00:04:56.97,00:04:56.97,"Ryan, you want to stoke that fire up"
99,00:04:59.23,00:04:59.23,"and check that water, see if it's boiling, please."
100,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,ROB: Roger definitely  is very bossy.
101,00:05:03.10,00:05:03.10," Go-Go do this, go do that."
102,00:05:05.23,00:05:05.23,"I just go-go and do it, but"
103,00:05:06.83,00:05:06.83, I'll put it all  in a mental note.
104,00:05:08.53,00:05:08.53,PROBST: Ryan and Daniel failed  to impress their tribe mates.
105,00:05:11.97,00:05:11.97,ROGER: This kid Ryan  and the kid Daniel--
106,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63,"uh, they're just not contributing."
107,00:05:17.47,00:05:17.47, They're just useless.
108,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,"PROBST: Despite their  differences, the men seemed"
109,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50, to have it together.
110,00:05:22.53,00:05:22.53,ALL: Tambaqui!
111,00:05:23.80,00:05:23.80,-Oh! -Oh!
112,00:05:24.97,00:05:24.97,We're like the Eight Musketeers.
113,00:05:27.00,00:05:27.00,"PROBST: But at Jaburu, the women had different priorities."
114,00:05:30.10,00:05:30.10,DEENA:   We're having a difficult time
115,00:05:32.27,00:05:32.27," getting our tasks in order,"
116,00:05:34.27,00:05:34.27, completing them and moving on  to the next project.
117,00:05:36.30,00:05:36.30," It's a,  ""I'm kind of feeling like"
118,00:05:38.87,00:05:38.87," I need to wash my buff now,""  so we wash the buffs."
119,00:05:43.40,00:05:43.40,I'm thinking shelter.
120,00:05:46.40,00:05:46.40,"PROBST: On day three,  Janet found surviving"
121,00:05:48.47,00:05:48.47, in the Amazon tougher  than she imagined.
122,00:05:51.00,00:05:51.00,JANET:  I hit rock bottom today.
123,00:05:52.43,00:05:52.43," You know, I planned on it"
124,00:05:53.77,00:05:53.77," being difficult,  but not brutal."
125,00:05:55.30,00:05:55.30,I don't think I've ever been this physically exhausted.
126,00:05:57.90,00:05:57.90,I don't know if I can do a challenge.
127,00:05:59.93,00:05:59.93,I'm having trouble walking.
128,00:06:01.67,00:06:01.67,PROBST:  At the immunity challenge...
129,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33,Go!
130,00:06:05.90,00:06:05.90, ...the men jumped out  to an early lead.
131,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,Men are out first.
132,00:06:09.33,00:06:09.33,Feet can't touch!
133,00:06:11.07,00:06:11.07,"No, Daniel!"
134,00:06:12.23,00:06:12.23,"-No...! -No. Come on, Daniel!"
135,00:06:13.27,00:06:13.27,PROBST:  But Ryan and Daniel
136,00:06:14.50,00:06:14.50, couldn't handle  the balance beam...
137,00:06:15.93,00:06:15.93,Go!
138,00:06:18.43,00:06:18.43,PROBST: ...so the women  seized the opportunity.
139,00:06:20.30,00:06:20.30,"Guys, you've lost your lead."
140,00:06:22.33,00:06:22.33,The ladies have completed the balance beam.
141,00:06:24.53,00:06:24.53,(whooping)
142,00:06:25.77,00:06:25.77, And Heidi lead Jaburu  to victory.
143,00:06:27.33,00:06:27.33,(screaming and laughing)
144,00:06:32.40,00:06:32.40,(screaming)
145,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,Jaburu wins immunity.
146,00:06:35.13,00:06:35.13,(whooping and shrieking)
147,00:06:39.53,00:06:39.53," Back at Tambaqui,"
148,00:06:41.03,00:06:41.03, Rob's strategy was to play  both sides of the fence.
149,00:06:43.57,00:06:43.57,"ROB:   Privately, Ryan has asked me"
150,00:06:45.40,00:06:45.40," to vote with him  to get rid of Roger,"
151,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83," and Roger has asked me to vote  with him to get rid of Ryan,"
152,00:06:52.27,00:06:52.27,and I've told them both that I will do what they want.
153,00:06:55.80,00:06:55.80,"PROBST:  At the first Tribal Council,"
154,00:06:59.17,00:06:59.17, Rob's vote was the difference.
155,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83," Roger had three votes, but"
156,00:07:02.93,00:07:02.93," Ryan had four,  and he was the first person"
157,00:07:04.77,00:07:04.77, voted out of the tribe.
158,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
159,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,"It's time for you to go, man."
160,00:07:12.57,00:07:12.57,"RYAN: It's-It's upsetting with  being the first one voted off,"
161,00:07:15.00,00:07:15.00,"and it's going to suck, 'cause you know the boys back home"
162,00:07:17.10,00:07:17.10,"are going to give you a lot of crap,"
163,00:07:18.67,00:07:18.67,"and the family's going to be disappointed,"
164,00:07:20.03,00:07:20.03," and when it's a tie vote,"
165,00:07:21.57,00:07:21.57," and it was separated  by one vote,"
166,00:07:23.23,00:07:23.23," and the one vote was somebody  that I kind of aligned with,"
167,00:07:25.70,00:07:25.70, it's really tough  to swallow.
168,00:07:31.03,00:07:31.03,"PROBST: Trying to improve  their situation on day four,"
169,00:07:35.23,00:07:35.23, Jeanne and Joanna  set out for food.
170,00:07:37.47,00:07:37.47,"There's some over here, but they're hard to get into."
171,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67, The natural resources  in the Amazon are fish.
172,00:07:43.27,00:07:43.27," There's some plants that  we can eat, plenty of nuts,"
173,00:07:46.40,00:07:46.40," and lots of fruit, but we  haven't explored enough, so..."
174,00:07:49.77,00:07:49.77,I just spend whatever time I have available to go hunt.
175,00:07:53.83,00:07:53.83,"-Oh, my... -Oh, my God!"
176,00:07:55.20,00:07:55.20,What? Did you find it?
177,00:07:56.37,00:07:56.37,-It's a pineapple! -(both screaming)
178,00:07:59.73,00:07:59.73,"-Oh, my God! -Oh, my God! Pineapple!"
179,00:08:02.07,00:08:02.07,(screaming)
180,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23,(Joanna mumbles)
181,00:08:04.77,00:08:04.77,Are they under the ground?
182,00:08:06.20,00:08:06.20,Here's a pineapple.
183,00:08:07.77,00:08:07.77,"-Oh, my... -Thank you, Lord."
184,00:08:10.10,00:08:10.10,(yelling)
185,00:08:12.47,00:08:12.47,"It's not ripe, but..."
186,00:08:14.87,00:08:14.87,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah! \xe2\x99\xaa
187,00:08:17.60,00:08:17.60,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah! \xe2\x99\xaa
188,00:08:20.10,00:08:20.10,"-So, I can't believe... -Look at this."
189,00:08:22.17,00:08:22.17,"JOANNA: Jeanne and I came back  to camp with the pineapple,"
190,00:08:24.77,00:08:24.77, and I had the pineapple  concealed in my jacket.
191,00:08:27.17,00:08:27.17,And we wanted everyone to be there
192,00:08:28.63,00:08:28.63,when we pulled out this pineapple.
193,00:08:29.90,00:08:29.90,(singing a fanfare)
194,00:08:31.23,00:08:31.23,"-Drum roll, please. -Oh, no."
195,00:08:32.70,00:08:32.70,(all screaming and cheering)
196,00:08:35.93,00:08:35.93,That was a pineapple bush.
197,00:08:37.10,00:08:37.10,(cheering)
198,00:08:38.53,00:08:38.53,All right!
199,00:08:39.80,00:08:39.80,JOANNA: This is the Amazon.
200,00:08:41.03,00:08:41.03,This may be the size of the pineapples here.
201,00:08:42.37,00:08:42.37,It's yellowing.

204,00:08:46.37,00:08:46.37,"This is good, thank you."
205,00:08:47.63,00:08:47.63,"-Yeah! -Look at that, and..."

207,00:08:51.70,00:08:51.70,It is sweet. Mm-hmm.
208,00:08:56.03,00:08:56.03,"-Oh, my God. -(shrieking)"
209,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83,JENNA:  I don't know if it's because
210,00:09:00.23,00:09:00.23," we're starving, and probably  anything tastes good."
211,00:09:02.53,00:09:02.53," But it was so good,"
212,00:09:04.20,00:09:04.20,"and, uh, I think it kind of like lifted everybody else's"
213,00:09:06.30,00:09:06.30," spirits a little bit,"
214,00:09:07.63,00:09:07.63," because we were just,  like, delirious."
215,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,"Okay, I need about ten more, and I'll be really good to go."
216,00:09:11.90,00:09:11.90,(laughter)
217,00:09:18.77,00:09:18.77,PROBST: But the good spirits  didn't last long
218,00:09:21.53,00:09:21.53, when controversy  arose in the camp.
219,00:09:23.63,00:09:23.63,Yeah.
220,00:09:24.77,00:09:24.77,What is that?
221,00:09:26.27,00:09:26.27,There's something in there that shouldn't be in there.
222,00:09:28.20,00:09:28.20,JENNA: We put all of our stuff  in the box.
223,00:09:30.10,00:09:30.10,"At the bottom, there's a granola bar."
224,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,Somebody just needs to fess up.
225,00:09:33.70,00:09:33.70,DEENA: Everybody is  adamantly denying it.
226,00:09:35.80,00:09:35.80,"And of course, I want to know who took the candy bar."
227,00:09:38.07,00:09:38.07,Jeanne saw the little candy bar thing inside of Janet's bag.
228,00:09:42.47,00:09:42.47,"PROBST:  With all eyes looking at her,"
229,00:09:43.87,00:09:43.87, Janet denied any involvement.
230,00:09:46.57,00:09:46.57,"I don't know who smuggled it in, but it wasn't me."
231,00:09:50.27,00:09:50.27,"So if you're going to vote me off,"
232,00:09:52.27,00:09:52.27,"that's fine, as long as it's not for that reason,"
233,00:09:54.20,00:09:54.20,"because if it is, you're making a mistake."
234,00:09:58.37,00:09:58.37,"PROBST: For immunity, the men and women"
235,00:09:59.80,00:09:59.80, faced off in their first  mental challenge.
236,00:10:02.53,00:10:02.53,How many rungs are on the outside ladder?
237,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57,"Deena says eight, Rob says six."
238,00:10:08.10,00:10:08.10,Correct answer: six.
239,00:10:10.27,00:10:10.27, And the men celebrated  their first victory...
240,00:10:12.83,00:10:12.83,(cheering)
241,00:10:16.10,00:10:16.10," ...sending the women  to their first Tribal Council,"
242,00:10:18.83,00:10:18.83, where Janet was the second person voted out of the Amazon.
243,00:10:21.57,00:10:21.57,Janet. That's four and that's enough.
244,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67,Need to bring me your torch.
245,00:10:24.93,00:10:24.93,"JANET:  We'd gone, you know,"
246,00:10:26.63,00:10:26.63, six days without food.
247,00:10:28.00,00:10:28.00,"We were having trouble getting water boiled,"
248,00:10:29.97,00:10:29.97,so we were barely drinking.
249,00:10:31.37,00:10:31.37," And then hard, hard  physical labor all day long."
250,00:10:34.40,00:10:34.40,"Janet, the tribe has spoken."
251,00:10:37.23,00:10:37.23,"JANET: Here, these 23-year-olds  were dropping like flies,"
252,00:10:40.77,00:10:40.77," so I had to wonder, at 46,  realistically here,"
253,00:10:44.07,00:10:44.07, how much longer  could I really take out there?
254,00:10:48.20,00:10:48.20,"So, I think this is a midlife crisis gone extremely wrong."
255,00:10:51.77,00:10:51.77,(laughs)
256,00:11:01.93,00:11:01.93,"PROBST: That night, after  Tribal Council, the women had"
257,00:11:04.60,00:11:04.60," trouble sleeping,  as the Amazon came alive."
258,00:11:07.43,00:11:07.43,"JEANNE:  There's been a lot more,"
259,00:11:08.83,00:11:08.83," um, noises  in the jungle tonight."
260,00:11:11.27,00:11:11.27,And I just saw something over there.
261,00:11:14.03,00:11:14.03, I did hear something  over where our food is.
262,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37, Heidi heard the same thing.
263,00:11:18.50,00:11:18.50, She got up.
264,00:11:19.57,00:11:19.57, She had to go to the bathroom.
265,00:11:21.10,00:11:21.10,The lantern's on the box.
266,00:11:22.50,00:11:22.50,HEIDI: I've never heard  any noises this close
267,00:11:25.27,00:11:25.27," to our camp before,  and that just creeps me out."
268,00:11:27.50,00:11:27.50,I really think that they're just getting used to us.
269,00:11:29.47,00:11:29.47,"I mean, it's definitely an animal."
270,00:11:30.63,00:11:30.63,It's so close to our camp.
271,00:11:32.57,00:11:32.57,I'll go with you. I'll bring my machete.
272,00:11:34.43,00:11:34.43,What is it going to do?
273,00:11:35.93,00:11:35.93,Okay.
274,00:11:41.00,00:11:41.00,(makes whooshing sounds)
275,00:11:48.30,00:11:48.30,Something's breathing over there.
276,00:11:50.83,00:11:50.83,What's that?
277,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,"HEIDI: Literally, bats are  swooping down at our head."
278,00:11:56.10,00:11:56.10,(grunting)
279,00:11:58.27,00:11:58.27,So I'm a little freaked out right now.
280,00:12:00.93,00:12:00.93,(anxious laugh)
281,00:12:02.40,00:12:02.40,And I've really got to go to the bathroom.
282,00:12:04.37,00:12:04.37,-You afraid? -Yeah.
283,00:12:06.53,00:12:06.53," So we run over, trying to  get away from the bats..."
284,00:12:09.73,00:12:09.73,I just-- I see something glowing out there.
285,00:12:11.73,00:12:11.73, ...and here are these sets
286,00:12:13.00,00:12:13.00, of glowing eyes  just staring at us.
287,00:12:15.57,00:12:15.57,-You see it? -Yep.
288,00:12:17.20,00:12:17.20,Do you want to go down there to go to the bathroom?
289,00:12:21.43,00:12:21.43,You can hold it?
290,00:12:23.23,00:12:23.23,Yes.
291,00:12:24.63,00:12:24.63,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little freaked."
292,00:12:26.67,00:12:26.67,"-Come on, let's walk down here. -No."
293,00:12:28.47,00:12:28.47,Come down here and I'll dig a hole.
294,00:12:31.00,00:12:31.00,No.
295,00:12:32.17,00:12:32.17,HEIDI: There is  a million and one things
296,00:12:33.77,00:12:33.77, to fear in this environment.
297,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30," And when it's in the dark,  it's just scary."
298,00:12:43.30,00:12:43.30,"PROBST: By day seven, Roger and  Daniel weren't getting along."

300,00:12:48.63,00:12:48.63,can you get us some water?
301,00:12:50.03,00:12:50.03,Sure.
302,00:12:52.07,00:12:52.07,"I don't, I don't..."
303,00:12:54.77,00:12:54.77,"If you, if you--"
304,00:12:56.43,00:12:56.43,I'll go do it.
305,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10,ROGER:  It really got me hot.
306,00:13:03.00,00:13:03.00,"I-- tempted to slap the kid around, to be honest with you."
307,00:13:05.07,00:13:05.07,DANIEL: Roger-- he just  barks orders all the time.
308,00:13:08.70,00:13:08.70,"I mean, he's not very friendly about it."
309,00:13:10.10,00:13:10.10,He just tells people what to do.
310,00:13:11.77,00:13:11.77," Uh, I'm not really  speaking to Roger right now."
311,00:13:14.07,00:13:14.07,"PROBST:  As Tambaqui was coming apart,"
312,00:13:16.40,00:13:16.40, Jaburu was coming together.
313,00:13:18.27,00:13:18.27,"So I think we should, uh, maybe initiate a leader."
314,00:13:23.53,00:13:23.53,"I, um, initiate Deena."
315,00:13:25.20,00:13:25.20,Do you accept the offer?
316,00:13:28.07,00:13:28.07,"You know, I'm gonna--"
317,00:13:29.30,00:13:29.30,All I want to do is we delegate the tasks
318,00:13:31.30,00:13:31.30,that are important for the day.
319,00:13:33.20,00:13:33.20,DEENA: I didn't take that  with open arms
320,00:13:34.83,00:13:34.83,because that puts a big target on your body.
321,00:13:36.80,00:13:36.80,And who wants to get voted out of the game?
322,00:13:38.93,00:13:38.93," But, yes, I am going to do it."
323,00:13:41.77,00:13:41.77,PROBST: Deena's leadership  sparked new life into

325,00:13:57.70,00:13:57.70,(chuckles)
326,00:14:06.80,00:14:06.80,DEENA: The net effect of  the leadership has been that
327,00:14:08.90,00:14:08.90, the camp looks like  it's organized.
328,00:14:11.20,00:14:11.20,"Like, it looks as if somebody, yes, lives there and cares about"
329,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37,their environment and is going to take care of it.
330,00:14:16.40,00:14:16.40," It was what we needed  to get us at par,"
331,00:14:19.27,00:14:19.27,so that we could play the game against the men.
332,00:14:21.53,00:14:21.53,-Go! -Here it is.
333,00:14:23.30,00:14:23.30,Don't pull it yet.

358,00:15:31.30,00:15:31.30," So I figured,"

360,00:15:34.43,00:15:34.43,"that if we could swing Deena's vote,"

362,00:15:37.73,00:15:37.73,I just need to know.
363,00:15:38.97,00:15:38.97,Yes.

366,00:15:42.67,00:15:42.67,and it just seemed natural to me
367,00:15:44.33,00:15:44.33, that that would be  a great alliance.
368,00:15:46.13,00:15:46.13, We need four.

375,00:15:59.73,00:15:59.73, is the hardest worker  in the tribe.
376,00:16:01.97,00:16:01.97," I work very hard,  but I'm not nearly as strong"

379,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,but there's only so much that-that I can do.
380,00:16:12.27,00:16:12.27,"All right, Alex, watch it, watch it."
381,00:16:14.27,00:16:14.27,I'm going to bring this in here.
382,00:16:18.00,00:16:18.00, One thing that I try to do  consistently through this game

384,00:16:21.23,00:16:21.23," be, uh, well-liked  within the tribe, and"

391,00:16:39.07,00:16:39.07,What makes me think that I'm the next one to go is just the way

393,00:16:44.87,00:16:44.87, are always together and how useful Matt is at catching fish

395,00:16:50.60,00:16:50.60, I think that maybe they're  going to weigh it out
396,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33, and decide that  the guy that does
397,00:16:53.57,00:16:53.57,the wisecracks isn't as useful
398,00:16:54.70,00:16:54.70,as the guy that catches the fish.

404,00:17:09.10,00:17:09.10,(cheering)
405,00:17:11.13,00:17:11.13,Burn! Burn! Burn!
406,00:17:13.13,00:17:13.13,(cheering)
407,00:17:14.63,00:17:14.63,Tambaqui wins reward!
408,00:17:16.30,00:17:16.30, While Tambaqui  toasted their victory...
409,00:17:18.37,00:17:18.37,"Oh, yeah, boys."
410,00:17:19.90,00:17:19.90,Tambaqui!
411,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17, ...Jaburu returned  to camp empty-handed.
412,00:17:25.50,00:17:25.50, And Shawna was ready  to call it quits.
413,00:17:27.87,00:17:27.87,"After we lost that Coke, it took everything in my entire brain"
414,00:17:31.43,00:17:31.43,to not make my body just want to just sit on the sand
415,00:17:34.40,00:17:34.40,"and be, like, I have to take a three-hour break."
416,00:17:37.23,00:17:37.23,I don't see myself lasting for 30 more days.
417,00:17:39.87,00:17:39.87,Are you at this point right this very moment
418,00:17:41.33,00:17:41.33,"where you say, ""I want out""?"
419,00:17:43.40,00:17:43.40,"If we were going tonight,"
420,00:17:44.73,00:17:44.73,I would be very tempted to get out.
421,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,"Yeah, I don't know that I could do it."
422,00:17:53.60,00:17:53.60,PROBST: Shawna sat out the next  challenge and watched...
423,00:17:56.33,00:17:56.33,No! No!
424,00:17:57.57,00:17:57.57,-Ah! Damn you! -(groaning)
425,00:17:58.93,00:17:58.93, ...as the men  fished their way to immunity.
426,00:18:03.63,00:18:03.63,"Tambaqui, congratulations."
427,00:18:05.57,00:18:05.57,Yeah!
428,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67," Even though Shawna was weak,"
429,00:18:11.00,00:18:11.00," the alliance of  Deena, Heidi and Jenna"
430,00:18:13.60,00:18:13.60, planned to keep her  trapped in the Amazon.
431,00:18:16.43,00:18:16.43,DEENA: I feel a tremendous  amount of compassion for her.
432,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,"But at the same time, you have an agreement."
433,00:18:20.50,00:18:20.50,And I don't want to get screwed to help her out.
434,00:18:22.50,00:18:22.50,Joanna is clearly
435,00:18:23.93,00:18:23.93, the most physical person  that we have on this team.
436,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83," She has too much power,  too much force."
437,00:18:29.17,00:18:29.17,"Shawna, guess what?"
438,00:18:30.57,00:18:30.57,You're not in charge here.
439,00:18:31.90,00:18:31.90, It's about the core alliance.
440,00:18:33.63,00:18:33.63," Suck it up, baby, 'cause  you're along for the ride."
441,00:18:37.60,00:18:37.60,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  despite Shawna's weakness,"
442,00:18:39.33,00:18:39.33, the alliance voted Joanna  out of the tribe.
443,00:18:42.93,00:18:42.93,Joanna. Need to bring me your torch.
444,00:18:45.10,00:18:45.10,JOANNA: I didn't expect  to be voted off that night.
445,00:18:47.40,00:18:47.40, I knew that
446,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,Deena would come after me
447,00:18:49.80,00:18:49.80,because I was-- my presence was very strong there.
448,00:18:52.00,00:18:52.00,"Joanna, the tribe has spoken."
449,00:18:55.77,00:18:55.77," The water's nasty,  I'm struggling,"
450,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,"I don't have any help out here,"
451,00:18:59.60,00:18:59.60,"nobody's fishing, everybody's laying down looking crazy,"
452,00:19:02.00,00:19:02.00,"it's hot, I'm hungry."
453,00:19:03.63,00:19:03.63," I felt like I was playing  the physical aspect,"
454,00:19:05.87,00:19:05.87,the survival aspect of the game  by myself.
455,00:19:13.90,00:19:13.90,"PROBST: The next morning,  Christy proved"
456,00:19:15.97,00:19:15.97, the women could still provide  for themselves.
457,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90,"CHRISTY:  Today, I kind of felt like,"
458,00:19:20.77,00:19:20.77," kind of cool, you know,  and so I go out, I go fishing,"
459,00:19:23.63,00:19:23.63,"and bam, bam, bam, I catch fish,"
460,00:19:25.37,00:19:25.37,and I provide lunch for the tribe.
461,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53, And it really does
462,00:19:30.87,00:19:30.87,"make you feel good, you know."
463,00:19:32.40,00:19:32.40,It feels good knowing that you can actually
464,00:19:34.83,00:19:34.83," get food for somebody,  you know?"
465,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17, So we can survive  without Joanna.
466,00:19:44.07,00:19:44.07,Jeanne and Shawna are commiserating.
467,00:19:46.27,00:19:46.27,"Is that like, discussing, arguing?"
468,00:19:49.10,00:19:49.10,"No, feeling really bad for each other."
469,00:19:51.47,00:19:51.47,"CHRISTY: Really? -""I'm sorry that Joanna's gone, I'm sorry"
470,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,"-that you're still here."" -Still here."
471,00:19:55.10,00:19:55.10,"""I never would have let you stay here."""
472,00:19:56.87,00:19:56.87,"Blah, blah, blah."
473,00:19:58.20,00:19:58.20,CHRISTY: Commiserating?
474,00:19:59.37,00:19:59.37,DEENA: Commiserate.
475,00:20:00.47,00:20:00.47,Commiserate.
476,00:20:03.40,00:20:03.40,JEANNE: I'm not going to roll over and die because
477,00:20:05.90,00:20:05.90,Joanna's not here.
478,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80,"I mean, I think you should have been voted off."
479,00:20:10.40,00:20:10.40,As much as I love you-- I think you're the greatest kid
480,00:20:12.37,00:20:12.37,"in the world, you know I do."
481,00:20:13.53,00:20:13.53,"No. Actually, it's a good point."
482,00:20:14.80,00:20:14.80,I know exactly what you're saying now...
483,00:20:16.13,00:20:16.13,JEANNE: I think we need as much energy as we can get.
484,00:20:18.43,00:20:18.43,-And you don't have it. -I agree. I agree.
485,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,Maybe the tribe has a plan that they didn't share with me.
486,00:20:24.10,00:20:24.10,"PROBST: Frustrated  by Joanna's departure,"
487,00:20:26.70,00:20:26.70, Jeanne cooked up a plot  for revenge.
488,00:20:29.07,00:20:29.07,"JEANNE:  Mentally, I'm right there."
489,00:20:31.47,00:20:31.47," Joanna leaving made me sad,  but you know what?"
490,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50," In honor of her,  I'm going to kick their butts."
491,00:20:35.93,00:20:35.93, She would like that.
492,00:20:37.13,00:20:37.13,One meatball.
493,00:20:38.70,00:20:38.70," I, uh, cooked the fish, and  then they all wanted manioc."
494,00:20:42.07,00:20:42.07," And I opened the lid  on our container of manioc,"
495,00:20:44.63,00:20:44.63, and it contained
496,00:20:45.80,00:20:45.80,"pink fuzz, green fuzz."
497,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,I saw
498,00:20:49.73,00:20:49.73," white maggots, ants,  skinny little worms."
499,00:20:53.97,00:20:53.97, Half the barrel is mush.
500,00:20:55.57,00:20:55.57,"Good eating. Good eating, folks."
501,00:20:57.63,00:20:57.63, And I knew how to cook it  so that they would like it.
502,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37," I went in, got a little  of the mushy stuff,"
503,00:21:03.10,00:21:03.10,dipped it into the crunchy stuff.
504,00:21:04.50,00:21:04.50,"Got a little green mold, a little pink mold"
505,00:21:06.17,00:21:06.17, and kind of  rolled it all together into
506,00:21:09.17,00:21:09.17," little hot dog,  bite-size morsels, and..."
507,00:21:12.40,00:21:12.40, kind of dried them slowly  over the ashes.
508,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,"Meatballs are cooking, girls."
509,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,All right!
510,00:21:18.53,00:21:18.53,And they're gonna be... great!
511,00:21:21.23,00:21:21.23,CHRISTY: Yay.
512,00:21:23.03,00:21:23.03,"-We're gonna have a good meal. -JEANNE: Oh, it's gonna taste"
513,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,like beef stew and your mom's biscuits.
514,00:21:28.17,00:21:28.17,They devoured them.
515,00:21:29.37,00:21:29.37, They thought  they were sesame treats.
516,00:21:31.20,00:21:31.20,Excellent.
517,00:21:32.40,00:21:32.40,"-God bless you. -CHRISTY: Mmm, Jeanne!"
518,00:21:34.80,00:21:34.80,-This is the ticket. -DEENA: This really is too good.
519,00:21:36.30,00:21:36.30,I wouldn't eat one if you paid me.
520,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17," Hopefully,  they'll all keel over."
521,00:21:40.93,00:21:40.93," -They might.  -Mm, wonderful."
522,00:21:42.80,00:21:42.80,-I could eat this all day. -Mm-hmm.

529,00:22:13.43,00:22:13.43, PROBST: So Dave and Jenna met  for date night in the jungle.
530,00:22:17.23,00:22:17.23,"-JENNA: Oh, my God. -(Dave laughs)"
531,00:22:19.33,00:22:19.33,JENNA:   We were so excited
532,00:22:20.93,00:22:20.93, to actually talk to someone of the opposite sex.
533,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"We were, like, ready to just, like, chat away."
534,00:22:26.73,00:22:26.73,DAVE:  Jenna did go into great detail
535,00:22:29.07,00:22:29.07, about the status of her tribe.
536,00:22:31.93,00:22:31.93,"Heidi, who I've become really close to..."
537,00:22:34.43,00:22:34.43,"-I expected that. -She's, like,"
538,00:22:35.97,00:22:35.97,"really, really upbeat all the time,"
539,00:22:37.53,00:22:37.53,and Shawna's falling apart.
540,00:22:39.40,00:22:39.40,She doesn't want to be here.
541,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,We just keep her on the tribe.

551,00:22:58.10,00:22:58.10,We told it all.
552,00:22:59.87,00:22:59.87,We pretty much know everything about each other.
553,00:23:01.57,00:23:01.57,"Well, I am glad to hear"
554,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,"that you guys shared a little bit of information,"
555,00:23:05.23,00:23:05.23,and that information's gonna come in real handy.
556,00:23:07.37,00:23:07.37,"We're gonna have a little draft,"
557,00:23:09.13,00:23:09.13,and you two are in charge of picking new tribes.

569,00:23:40.27,00:23:40.27, of testosterone can do  for somebody.
570,00:23:41.93,00:23:41.93,"Boys come into the camp, and Shawna is 180 degrees better."

796,00:32:41.77,00:32:41.77," the tribe enjoyed getting  acquainted,"
797,00:32:42.97,00:32:42.97, but Roger brought an end  to all the fun.
798,00:32:45.23,00:32:45.23,"ROGER: We had a tendency  to be festive all afternoon,"
799,00:32:48.37,00:32:48.37,forgetting the fact that we had to get a shelter built.
800,00:32:55.20,00:32:55.20,"CHRISTY: Um, can I start putting the floorboards down?"
801,00:32:59.60,00:32:59.60,"ROGER: Well, we got that... we have that under control."
802,00:33:01.37,00:33:01.37,Helping Rob split the fronds would be really great.
803,00:33:04.57,00:33:04.57,Okay? Can you lift...?
804,00:33:06.50,00:33:06.50,"CHRISTY: I'm not working on the shelter,"
805,00:33:09.20,00:33:09.20,which really pisses me off because
806,00:33:10.37,00:33:10.37,I really would like to be a part it.
807,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,PROBST:   Roger felt
808,00:33:12.87,00:33:12.87, everything was falling  into place.
809,00:33:14.53,00:33:14.53,"ROGER: Yeah, we got six guys  and four girls,"
810,00:33:16.60,00:33:16.60,"and our original game plan was,"
811,00:33:18.00,00:33:18.00,the six guys against...
812,00:33:19.87,00:33:19.87,"against, the, uh... against the girls,"
813,00:33:22.03,00:33:22.03,"and you know, it should be, just pick 'em off."
814,00:33:25.47,00:33:25.47,PROBST: But he was unaware of the forces working against him.
815,00:33:27.93,00:33:27.93,DEENA: But you understand what we have to do.
816,00:33:30.80,00:33:30.80,We have to start picking off the stronger males.
817,00:33:32.80,00:33:32.80,"Yeah, but please let Roger go first, please."
818,00:33:34.90,00:33:34.90,"Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no..."
819,00:33:36.60,00:33:36.60,"I don't care what you want after that, but..."
820,00:33:38.13,00:33:38.13,"-DEENA: No. -But then after Roger, who?"
821,00:33:41.90,00:33:41.90,"I don't know, but he's got to go."
822,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,ALEX:  Roger is of the belief
823,00:33:45.57,00:33:45.57," that we are all, um... all the guys are together, and, um,"
824,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,"unless he wins individual immunity,"
825,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,he'll be the first one to go.
826,00:33:54.63,00:33:54.63,"PROBST: Feeling confident  at the immunity challenge,"
827,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67, Roger jumped in early.
828,00:33:58.27,00:33:58.27,"ROGER: All right, I've had it."
829,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,Roger has given up.
830,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33,"With little fanfare, he's out of the game."
831,00:34:06.90,00:34:06.90,PROBST: Deena won the first  individual immunity.
832,00:34:09.97,00:34:09.97,Congratulations.
833,00:34:11.47,00:34:11.47,"-All right, Deena. Yeah! -(whooping and cheering)"
834,00:34:19.53,00:34:19.53,PROBST:  At Jacar\xc3\xa9's first visit
835,00:34:21.53,00:34:21.53," to Tribal Council,  Roger felt safe..."
836,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,You gotta feel a little bit confident.
837,00:34:26.40,00:34:26.40,"I would say, yeah, I-I probably do."
838,00:34:28.67,00:34:28.67,"You know, obviously, if I really felt"
839,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,"that I needed that immunity, I would have given it my all."
840,00:34:35.07,00:34:35.07,PROBST:  ...and was blindsided
841,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20, when seven votes came up  with his name on them.
842,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,ROGER:  I was a cocky...
843,00:34:42.33,00:34:42.33," You know, and I still am."
844,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20," You never lose  that self-confidence,"
845,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93," that positive, you know?"
846,00:34:48.63,00:34:48.63,"I'm a Type-A personality; I am a leader, I don't sit back."
847,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,"I'm opinionated, and that never"
848,00:34:55.73,00:34:55.73, goes away.
849,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,"Roger, the tribe has spoken."
850,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,"ROGER:  I came to win the game, but"
851,00:35:02.07,00:35:02.07,I wasn't deceptive enough.
852,00:35:03.40,00:35:03.40, I should've bit my tongue  and laid low.
853,00:35:06.33,00:35:06.33, I should've not exuded  that confidence.
854,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,"And, uh, I've no one to blame but myself."
855,00:35:11.33,00:35:11.33, They were better  than I am at the game.
856,00:35:19.93,00:35:19.93,"PROBST: The next morning, Dave  pondered his new situation."
857,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,DAVE:  What happened last night
858,00:35:25.47,00:35:25.47, was an interesting turn  of events.
859,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,All my stability and everything
860,00:35:29.80,00:35:29.80," has now been  turned upside down,"
861,00:35:32.50,00:35:32.50, because I did put my roots  into an alliance with Roger.
862,00:35:36.20,00:35:36.20, Now...
863,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,I gotta play the game according to how things are right now.
864,00:35:41.27,00:35:41.27,PROBST:   Dave tried to prove
865,00:35:42.77,00:35:42.77, he was still valuable  to the tribe.
866,00:35:45.13,00:35:45.13,"DAVE: Hopefully, just being  a hard worker and dedicated,"
867,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17, motivated and fun to be with
868,00:35:49.37,00:35:49.37,will keep me around for a little bit longer
869,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60," and start building, uh,  some alliances"
870,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17, with the people who are left.
871,00:35:55.23,00:35:55.23,"PROBST: That evening,  while tending the fire,"
872,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50, Dave pleaded his case
873,00:35:58.87,00:35:58.87, to Christy and tried  to swing her vote.
874,00:36:02.27,00:36:02.27,I felt guilty in a lot of the way I acted at Tambaqui.
875,00:36:06.50,00:36:06.50,That's kind of why I wanted
876,00:36:07.83,00:36:07.83,to have fire duty with you tonight.
877,00:36:09.80,00:36:09.80,(whispering): I voted for you last time and I felt bad.
878,00:36:13.13,00:36:13.13," You know, at my point,"
879,00:36:14.63,00:36:14.63," it's cleaning the slate,  making sure"
880,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43," that nobody's harboring  any hard feelings,"
881,00:36:18.30,00:36:18.30,"and, uh, also, you know, maybe get a vote or two."
882,00:36:21.33,00:36:21.33,"I'm a little stronger than some people, so I'm competition."
883,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,Yeah.
884,00:36:26.23,00:36:26.23,People want to get rid of me.
885,00:36:28.43,00:36:28.43,"And, uh, it kind of sucks."
886,00:36:31.63,00:36:31.63," Shortly thereafter,"
887,00:36:32.93,00:36:32.93, Christy said how much  she loved to dance.
888,00:36:34.47,00:36:34.47,"I happen to also like to dance,"
889,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"and when I asked her if she knew how to swing dance,"
890,00:36:38.67,00:36:38.67,she responded that she only knew how to salsa.
891,00:36:40.70,00:36:40.70,(whispering): Swing dancing is on six beats
892,00:36:42.53,00:36:42.53,"instead of four beats, right?"
893,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,Okay.
894,00:36:45.40,00:36:45.40,DAVE:  So I took the opportunity
895,00:36:46.57,00:36:46.57,to teach her a little swing dancing.
896,00:36:47.87,00:36:47.87,"-(snoring) -DAVE: The guy leads, and the girl follows,"
897,00:36:52.47,00:36:52.47,"and it has to work like that,"
898,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,"because if we both try to lead, it's not gonna work."
899,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,-(Christy whispers) -Right.
900,00:36:58.60,00:36:58.60,"So, in this case, it works pretty good"
901,00:37:00.97,00:37:00.97,"'cause I know what I'm doing,"
902,00:37:02.63,00:37:02.63,and you don't know what you're doing.
903,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,"So, for you, the beat is one, two..."
904,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,All right.
905,00:37:12.50,00:37:12.50,"Over here, like this."
906,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,"-Piece of cake, right? No problem? -Yeah."
907,00:37:22.17,00:37:22.17,So now that we got that...
908,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,Or we can do this.
909,00:37:37.80,00:37:37.80,Yeah. Not too bad.
910,00:37:39.73,00:37:39.73,Yeah.
911,00:37:41.10,00:37:41.10,"CHRISTY: It was a fun  fire watch, you know?"
912,00:37:43.07,00:37:43.07, It was entertaining.
913,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43," Dave, in general, seemed  like a really good guy,"
914,00:37:46.80,00:37:46.80, but I-I think he was  exaggerating a little bit
915,00:37:51.07,00:37:51.07, on how much  he really appreciates me.
916,00:37:53.30,00:37:53.30,That's it. So now you're a pro.
917,00:37:55.63,00:37:55.63,"CHRISTY: If you really  appreciate me,"
918,00:37:57.57,00:37:57.57,maybe you could show that a little bit throughout the game
919,00:38:00.13,00:38:00.13,"instead of, like, the day before"
920,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,you think you're going to get voted off.
921,00:38:07.53,00:38:07.53,"PROBST: At the immunity  challenge, Dave needed to win."
922,00:38:10.83,00:38:10.83,It's payback.
923,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,PROBST:  But his hopes were smashed
924,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53, when he was taken out early.
925,00:38:15.80,00:38:15.80, Jenna was  the last one standing.
926,00:38:19.30,00:38:19.30,"So at Tribal Council, Dave made  a final plea to the tribe."
927,00:38:23.97,00:38:23.97,DAVE: These next three days
928,00:38:25.73,00:38:25.73,"are... are important to me, and, um,"
929,00:38:27.93,00:38:27.93,and I would like to spend them with the-the eight people
930,00:38:30.20,00:38:30.20,that are sitting down here in front of me.
931,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,"PROBST:  But it wasn't enough,"
932,00:38:33.37,00:38:33.37, as eight votes made him  the first member of the jury.
933,00:38:36.03,00:38:36.03, DAVE: I guess that's what  really kind of caught me
934,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97," surprised when I finally  realized that,"
935,00:38:40.20,00:38:40.20,"you know, I am perceived as a threat."
936,00:38:42.40,00:38:42.40," It was, ""Wait a minute.  Now I'm the bad guy."""
937,00:38:44.80,00:38:44.80,"Dave, the tribe has spoken."
938,00:38:47.07,00:38:47.07,DAVE: My case is a prime example  how it is very difficult
939,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,to plan any more than a few days in advance.
940,00:38:54.97,00:38:54.97," I miscalculated and found  myself walking on thin ice,"
941,00:38:58.93,00:38:58.93, and it broke and sent me home.
942,00:39:04.80,00:39:04.80,"PROBST: By Day 25, the alliance  of Deena, Rob, Alex,"
943,00:39:08.37,00:39:08.37, Jenna and Heidi started  to unravel.

945,00:39:13.33,00:39:13.33,you're gonna be able to advance if-if Matt
946,00:39:15.17,00:39:15.17,or Alex is in this game?
947,00:39:16.60,00:39:16.60,Matt's not in the picture.
948,00:39:17.83,00:39:17.83,I understand that.
949,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,What if Matt wins immunity tomorrow?
950,00:39:24.27,00:39:24.27,"It seems to me, if Matt wins immunity, then Alex has to go."
951,00:39:31.47,00:39:31.47,(indistinct conversation)
952,00:39:32.93,00:39:32.93,"PROBST: That evening,  Heidi went straight to Jenna."
953,00:39:34.73,00:39:34.73,HEIDI: Alex and Jenna were  my original alliance.
954,00:39:37.70,00:39:37.70, I'm not gonna turn  my back on them.
955,00:39:39.70,00:39:39.70," So, I mean,  I just told Jenna about it,"
956,00:39:42.23,00:39:42.23,and I knew she'd speak to Alex about it.
957,00:39:44.33,00:39:44.33,She's... turned on us.
958,00:39:46.20,00:39:46.20,"So, we need to get her off."
959,00:39:49.00,00:39:49.00,Deena stabbed us all in the back because she's being selfish.
960,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47,I'm really pissed at her.
961,00:39:52.93,00:39:52.93,"PROBST:  Backed into a corner,"
962,00:39:54.43,00:39:54.43, Alex decided  to turn the tables on Deena.
963,00:39:56.63,00:39:56.63,"And so I grab Rob, and I was, like,"
964,00:39:57.97,00:39:57.97,"""Rob, dude, what's going on?"""
965,00:39:59.03,00:39:59.03,She wants you done sooner than later.

967,00:40:02.37,00:40:02.37,"We keep Christy, and we keep Butch."
968,00:40:05.10,00:40:05.10,And we get rid of Deena.
969,00:40:11.27,00:40:11.27,"PROBST: At the challenge,  the tribe's appetite"
970,00:40:12.67,00:40:12.67, for immunity was put  to the test.

972,00:40:23.47,00:40:23.47, so instead of battling Matthew  in the final round...

974,00:40:28.40,00:40:28.40, ...she gave up her chance  at immunity.

984,00:40:56.03,00:40:56.03, and it's okay  to be downright dirty.
985,00:40:58.20,00:40:58.20,The tribe has spoken.
