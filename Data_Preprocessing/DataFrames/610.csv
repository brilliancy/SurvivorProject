7,00:00:22.70,00:00:22.70,"'Cause Rob and I werethe great counters,"
8,00:00:24.03,00:00:24.03,"you know, for both tribes."

10,00:00:28.57,00:00:28.57, This is the hottest girl I've ever talked to.
11,00:00:30.37,00:00:30.37, She has both natural
12,00:00:32.87,00:00:32.87,and man-made beauty qualities.
13,00:00:36.10,00:00:36.10,"You know,you guys want in the cage."

17,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53," Be lots of signs, you know."
18,00:00:44.13,00:00:44.13," They were, like, ""We'll learn some signs."""
19,00:00:45.33,00:00:45.33,"Tambaqui is a fish,so this is fish."
20,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,"That is so great that peoplereally want to, like, learn."
21,00:00:52.90,00:00:52.90,"JEANNE:There's been a lot more,"
22,00:00:54.37,00:00:54.37,"um, noisesin the jungle tonight,"
23,00:00:57.50,00:00:57.50,and I just saw somethingover there.
24,00:01:00.37,00:01:00.37,"HEIDI: I mean, it's definitely an animal."
25,00:01:02.00,00:01:02.00, It's so close to our camp.
26,00:01:04.70,00:01:04.70,So I'm a little freaked outright now.
27,00:02:15.87,00:02:15.87,"PROBST: 27 days ago, 16 Americans were stranded"
28,00:02:19.97,00:02:19.97, in the middle of the Amazonian rain forest.
29,00:02:23.30,00:02:23.30,"Immediately, the castaways were separated into two tribes."
30,00:02:26.90,00:02:26.90,"As I call out your your name,"
31,00:02:28.30,00:02:28.30,I want youto climb down the rope ladder.
32,00:02:29.73,00:02:29.73,Jeanne. Heidi. Joanna.
33,00:02:32.87,00:02:32.87," And for the first time, the survivors"
34,00:02:34.87,00:02:34.87, were divided along gender lines.
35,00:02:37.47,00:02:37.47,"It is only fitting that, for thefirst time, while we're here"
36,00:02:39.80,00:02:39.80,"in the Amazon, we have a tribeof women versus a tribe of men."
37,00:02:43.80,00:02:43.80,(whooping and laughter)
38,00:02:44.80,00:02:44.80,DEENA: I was absolutely just
39,00:02:46.93,00:02:46.93, overjoyed that it was an all-female tribe.
40,00:02:48.90,00:02:48.90, It's an all-chick thing.
41,00:02:50.73,00:02:50.73,We can let our hair down.
42,00:02:52.23,00:02:52.23,We can peein front of each other.
43,00:02:53.97,00:02:53.97,-Dave.-Dave?
44,00:02:55.20,00:02:55.20,DANIEL: All the guys were really pumped up.
45,00:02:56.63,00:02:56.63, There is no way that women
46,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83, are going to beat us in anything--
47,00:03:00.23,00:03:00.23,"physical, mentally."
48,00:03:01.70,00:03:01.70, We're never going to go to Tribal Council.
49,00:03:03.80,00:03:03.80,Tribal Council-- we ain'tgoin' to Tribal Council.
50,00:03:05.87,00:03:05.87,JENNA: They're so freaking cocky.
51,00:03:07.90,00:03:07.90,I just want to beat them to justkind of like shut them up.
52,00:03:11.23,00:03:11.23,PROBST: But the women stumbled from the start.
53,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,Ryan?
54,00:03:13.60,00:03:13.60,(indistinct chatter)
55,00:03:20.60,00:03:20.60,"SHAWNA: I just couldn't even untie a boat,"
56,00:03:23.17,00:03:23.17, and I just felt so stupid.
57,00:03:25.03,00:03:25.03,The guys going off one way.
58,00:03:26.37,00:03:26.37,The girls couldn't untie...
59,00:03:27.53,00:03:27.53,"Well, I couldn't untie the knot."
60,00:03:28.80,00:03:28.80,"PROBST: When the men arrived at their camp,"
61,00:03:31.80,00:03:31.80, they brimmed with confidence.
62,00:03:33.23,00:03:33.23,-(whooping)-Yeah!
63,00:03:35.27,00:03:35.27,"You know, we're all... we'reall friggin' men of pride,"
64,00:03:37.13,00:03:37.13,"men of honor, whatnot..."
65,00:03:38.30,00:03:38.30,(laughter)
66,00:03:39.90,00:03:39.90,"-And right now, baby...-Tell it."
67,00:03:41.47,00:03:41.47,"Yeah, we're the favoritesright now."
68,00:03:43.03,00:03:43.03,PROBST: The Tambaqui men
69,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50, aggressively began to build their new camp.
70,00:03:50.67,00:03:50.67,I think I missed my callingin life as a lumberjack.
71,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,"PROBST: At Jaburu, Christy revealed her secret."
72,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,"I... It's not a big deal,but I think it's something"
73,00:04:01.17,00:04:01.17,"that every tribe membershould know, that I am deaf."
74,00:04:04.77,00:04:04.77,"I can't hear. I read lips.Um, night time..."
75,00:04:07.23,00:04:07.23,JANET: Christy has a hearing disability.
76,00:04:09.17,00:04:09.17, She just asked us to look at her
77,00:04:10.97,00:04:10.97,"and speak slowly,so she could read our lips."
78,00:04:13.90,00:04:13.90, It took us by surprise.
79,00:04:15.20,00:04:15.20,"Oh, my God."
80,00:04:16.73,00:04:16.73,"PROBST: Unlike the men, the women struggled"
81,00:04:18.30,00:04:18.30, to get their camp up and running.
82,00:04:19.73,00:04:19.73,(grunts)
83,00:04:21.73,00:04:21.73,We almost got it.
84,00:04:29.20,00:04:29.20,"PROBST: And unable to read lips in the dark,"
85,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10, Christy felt like an outsider.
86,00:04:32.20,00:04:32.20,Did you notice
87,00:04:33.83,00:04:33.83,the guys stared at Heidiwhen they got on the boat?
88,00:04:36.00,00:04:36.00,"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
89,00:04:38.57,00:04:38.57,I'm missing out on a lotof the information.
90,00:04:41.03,00:04:41.03," I could never be like them, because I'm not."
91,00:04:44.40,00:04:44.40, I'm always totally different;  always have been.
92,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,"(voice breaking): Just, like,I'm at a big disadvantage."
93,00:04:49.20,00:04:49.20,I'm at a big disadvantage.
94,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,(sniffles)
95,00:04:52.57,00:04:52.57,"PROBST: By day two, Roger was already annoying people."
96,00:04:55.70,00:04:55.70,Okay?
97,00:04:56.97,00:04:56.97,"Ryan, you want to stokethat fire up"
98,00:04:59.23,00:04:59.23,"and check that water,see if it's boiling, please."
99,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,ROB: Roger definitely is very bossy.
100,00:05:03.10,00:05:03.10," Go-Go do this, go do that."
101,00:05:05.23,00:05:05.23,"I just go-go and do it, but"
102,00:05:06.83,00:05:06.83, I'll put it all in a mental note.
103,00:05:08.53,00:05:08.53,PROBST: Ryan and Daniel failed  to impress their tribe mates.
104,00:05:11.97,00:05:11.97,ROGER: This kid Ryan and the kid Daniel--
105,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63,"uh, they're justnot contributing."
106,00:05:17.47,00:05:17.47, They're just useless.
107,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,"PROBST: Despite their differences, the men seemed"
108,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50, to have it together.
109,00:05:22.53,00:05:22.53,ALL:Tambaqui!
110,00:05:23.80,00:05:23.80,-Oh!-Oh!
111,00:05:24.97,00:05:24.97,We're likethe Eight Musketeers.
112,00:05:27.00,00:05:27.00,"PROBST: But at Jaburu, thewomen had different priorities."
113,00:05:30.10,00:05:30.10,DEENA:  We're having a difficult time
114,00:05:32.27,00:05:32.27," getting our tasks in order,"
115,00:05:34.27,00:05:34.27, completing them and moving on to the next project.
116,00:05:36.30,00:05:36.30," It's a, ""I'm kind of feeling like"
117,00:05:38.87,00:05:38.87," I need to wash my buff now,"" so we wash the buffs."
118,00:05:43.40,00:05:43.40,I'm thinking shelter.
119,00:05:46.40,00:05:46.40,"PROBST: On day three, Janet found surviving"
120,00:05:48.47,00:05:48.47, in the Amazon tougher than she imagined.
121,00:05:51.00,00:05:51.00,JANET: I hit rock bottom today.
122,00:05:52.43,00:05:52.43," You know, I planned on it"
123,00:05:53.77,00:05:53.77," being difficult, but not brutal."
124,00:05:55.30,00:05:55.30,I don't think I've ever beenthis physically exhausted.
125,00:05:57.90,00:05:57.90,I don't knowif I can do a challenge.
126,00:05:59.93,00:05:59.93,I'm having trouble walking.
127,00:06:01.67,00:06:01.67,PROBST: At the immunity challenge...
128,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33,Go!
129,00:06:05.90,00:06:05.90, ...the men jumped out to an early lead.
130,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,Men are out first.
131,00:06:09.33,00:06:09.33,Feet can't touch!
132,00:06:11.07,00:06:11.07,"No, Daniel!"
133,00:06:12.23,00:06:12.23,"-No...!-No. Come on, Daniel!"
134,00:06:13.27,00:06:13.27,PROBST: But Ryan and Daniel
135,00:06:14.50,00:06:14.50, couldn't handle the balance beam...
136,00:06:15.93,00:06:15.93,Go!
137,00:06:18.43,00:06:18.43,PROBST: ...so the women seized the opportunity.
138,00:06:20.30,00:06:20.30,"Guys, you've lost your lead."
139,00:06:22.33,00:06:22.33,The ladies have completedthe balance beam.
140,00:06:24.53,00:06:24.53,(whooping)
141,00:06:25.77,00:06:25.77, And Heidi lead Jaburu to victory.
142,00:06:27.33,00:06:27.33,(screaming and laughing)
143,00:06:32.40,00:06:32.40,(screaming)
144,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,Jaburu wins immunity.
145,00:06:35.13,00:06:35.13,(whooping and shrieking)
146,00:06:39.53,00:06:39.53," Back at Tambaqui,"
147,00:06:41.03,00:06:41.03, Rob's strategy was to play both sides of the fence.
148,00:06:43.57,00:06:43.57,"ROB:  Privately, Ryan has asked me"
149,00:06:45.40,00:06:45.40," to vote with him to get rid of Roger,"
150,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83," and Roger has asked me to vote with him to get rid of Ryan,"
151,00:06:52.27,00:06:52.27,and I've told them boththat I will do what they want.
152,00:06:55.80,00:06:55.80,"PROBST: At the first Tribal Council,"
153,00:06:59.17,00:06:59.17, Rob's vote was the difference.
154,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83," Roger had three votes, but"
155,00:07:02.93,00:07:02.93," Ryan had four, and he was the first person"
156,00:07:04.77,00:07:04.77, voted out of the tribe.
157,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
158,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,"It's time for you to go, man."
159,00:07:12.57,00:07:12.57,"RYAN: It's-It's upsetting with  being the first one voted off,"
160,00:07:15.00,00:07:15.00,"and it's going to suck, 'causeyou know the boys back home"
161,00:07:17.10,00:07:17.10,"are going to give youa lot of crap,"
162,00:07:18.67,00:07:18.67,"and the family's goingto be disappointed,"
163,00:07:20.03,00:07:20.03," and when it's a tie vote,"
164,00:07:21.57,00:07:21.57," and it was separated  by one vote,"
165,00:07:23.23,00:07:23.23," and the one vote was somebody that I kind of aligned with,"
166,00:07:25.70,00:07:25.70, it's really tough to swallow.
167,00:07:31.03,00:07:31.03,"PROBST: Trying to improve their situation on day four,"
168,00:07:35.23,00:07:35.23, Jeanne and Joanna set out for food.
169,00:07:37.47,00:07:37.47,"There's some over here,but they're hard to get into."
170,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67, The natural resources in the Amazon are fish.
171,00:07:43.27,00:07:43.27," There's some plants that we can eat, plenty of nuts,"
172,00:07:46.40,00:07:46.40," and lots of fruit, but we haven't explored enough, so..."
173,00:07:49.77,00:07:49.77,I just spend whatever timeI have available to go hunt.
174,00:07:53.83,00:07:53.83,"-Oh, my...-Oh, my God!"
175,00:07:55.20,00:07:55.20,What? Did you find it?
176,00:07:56.37,00:07:56.37,-It's a pineapple!-(both screaming)
177,00:07:59.73,00:07:59.73,"-Oh, my God!-Oh, my God! Pineapple!"
178,00:08:02.07,00:08:02.07,(screaming)
179,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23,(Joanna mumbles)
180,00:08:04.77,00:08:04.77,Are they under the ground?
181,00:08:06.20,00:08:06.20,Here's a pineapple.
182,00:08:07.77,00:08:07.77,"-Oh, my...-Thank you, Lord."
183,00:08:10.10,00:08:10.10,(yelling)
184,00:08:12.47,00:08:12.47,"It's not ripe, but..."
185,00:08:14.87,00:08:14.87,♪ Hallelujah! ♪
186,00:08:17.60,00:08:17.60,♪ Hallelujah! ♪
187,00:08:20.10,00:08:20.10,"-So, I can't believe...-Look at this."
188,00:08:22.17,00:08:22.17,"JOANNA: Jeanne and I came back to camp with the pineapple,"
189,00:08:24.77,00:08:24.77, and I had the pineapple concealed in my jacket.
190,00:08:27.17,00:08:27.17,And we wanted everyoneto be there
191,00:08:28.63,00:08:28.63,when we pulled outthis pineapple.
192,00:08:29.90,00:08:29.90,(singing a fanfare)
193,00:08:31.23,00:08:31.23,"-Drum roll, please.-Oh, no."
194,00:08:32.70,00:08:32.70,(all screaming and cheering)
195,00:08:35.93,00:08:35.93,That was a pineapple bush.
196,00:08:37.10,00:08:37.10,(cheering)
197,00:08:38.53,00:08:38.53,All right!
198,00:08:39.80,00:08:39.80,JOANNA:This is the Amazon.
199,00:08:41.03,00:08:41.03,This may be the sizeof the pineapples here.
200,00:08:42.37,00:08:42.37,It's yellowing.
201,00:08:43.67,00:08:43.67,(indistinct chatter)
202,00:08:45.00,00:08:45.00,"Wait a minute, girl. No."
203,00:08:46.37,00:08:46.37,"This is good, thank you."

206,00:08:51.70,00:08:51.70,It is sweet. Mm-hmm.
207,00:08:56.03,00:08:56.03,"-Oh, my God.-(shrieking)"
208,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83,JENNA: I don't know if it's because
209,00:09:00.23,00:09:00.23," we're starving, and probably  anything tastes good."
210,00:09:02.53,00:09:02.53," But it was so good,"
211,00:09:04.20,00:09:04.20,"and, uh, I think it kind of likelifted everybody else's"
212,00:09:06.30,00:09:06.30," spirits a little bit,"
213,00:09:07.63,00:09:07.63," because we were just, like, delirious."
214,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,"Okay, I need about ten more,and I'll be really good to go."
215,00:09:11.90,00:09:11.90,(laughter)
216,00:09:18.77,00:09:18.77,PROBST: But the good spirits didn't last long
217,00:09:21.53,00:09:21.53, when controversy arose in the camp.
218,00:09:23.63,00:09:23.63,Yeah.
219,00:09:24.77,00:09:24.77,What is that?
220,00:09:26.27,00:09:26.27,There's something in therethat shouldn't be in there.
221,00:09:28.20,00:09:28.20,JENNA: We put all of our stuff in the box.
222,00:09:30.10,00:09:30.10,"At the bottom,there's a granola bar."
223,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,Somebody just needs to fess up.
224,00:09:33.70,00:09:33.70,DEENA: Everybody is adamantly denying it.
225,00:09:35.80,00:09:35.80,"And of course, I want to knowwho took the candy bar."
226,00:09:38.07,00:09:38.07,Jeanne saw the little candy barthing inside of Janet's bag.
227,00:09:42.47,00:09:42.47,"PROBST: With all eyes looking at her,"
228,00:09:43.87,00:09:43.87, Janet denied any involvement.
229,00:09:46.57,00:09:46.57,"I don't know who smuggled it in,but it wasn't me."
230,00:09:50.27,00:09:50.27,"So if you're going tovote me off,"
231,00:09:52.27,00:09:52.27,"that's fine, as long asit's not for that reason,"
232,00:09:54.20,00:09:54.20,"because if it is,you're making a mistake."

236,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57,"Deena says eight, Rob says six."
237,00:10:08.10,00:10:08.10,Correct answer: six.
238,00:10:10.27,00:10:10.27, And the men celebrated their first victory...
239,00:10:12.83,00:10:12.83,(cheering)
240,00:10:16.10,00:10:16.10," ...sending the women to their first Tribal Council,"
241,00:10:18.83,00:10:18.83, where Janet was the secondperson voted out of the Amazon.
242,00:10:21.57,00:10:21.57,Janet.That's four and that's enough.
243,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67,Need to bring me your torch.
244,00:10:24.93,00:10:24.93,"JANET: We'd gone, you know,"
245,00:10:26.63,00:10:26.63, six days without food.
246,00:10:28.00,00:10:28.00,"We were having troublegetting water boiled,"
247,00:10:29.97,00:10:29.97,so we were barely drinking.
248,00:10:31.37,00:10:31.37," And then hard, hard physical labor all day long."
249,00:10:34.40,00:10:34.40,"Janet, the tribe has spoken."
250,00:10:37.23,00:10:37.23,"JANET: Here, these 23-year-olds were dropping like flies,"
251,00:10:40.77,00:10:40.77," so I had to wonder, at 46, realistically here,"
252,00:10:44.07,00:10:44.07, how much longer could I really take out there?
253,00:10:48.20,00:10:48.20,"So, I think this is a midlifecrisis gone extremely wrong."
254,00:10:51.77,00:10:51.77,(laughs)
255,00:11:01.93,00:11:01.93,"PROBST: That night, after Tribal Council, the women had"

259,00:11:11.27,00:11:11.27,And I just saw somethingover there.
260,00:11:14.03,00:11:14.03, I did hear something over where our food is.
261,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37, Heidi heard the same thing.
262,00:11:18.50,00:11:18.50, She got up.
263,00:11:19.57,00:11:19.57, She had to go to the bathroom.
264,00:11:21.10,00:11:21.10,The lantern's on the box.
265,00:11:22.50,00:11:22.50,HEIDI: I've never heard any noises this close
266,00:11:25.27,00:11:25.27," to our camp before, and that just creeps me out."
267,00:11:27.50,00:11:27.50,I really think thatthey're just getting used to us.
268,00:11:29.47,00:11:29.47,"I mean,it's definitely an animal."
269,00:11:30.63,00:11:30.63,It's so close to our camp.
270,00:11:32.57,00:11:32.57,I'll go with you.I'll bring my machete.
271,00:11:34.43,00:11:34.43,What is it going to do?
272,00:11:35.93,00:11:35.93,Okay.
273,00:11:41.00,00:11:41.00,(makes whooshing sounds)
274,00:11:48.30,00:11:48.30,Something's breathingover there.
275,00:11:50.83,00:11:50.83,What's that?
276,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,"HEIDI: Literally, bats are swooping down at our head."
277,00:11:56.10,00:11:56.10,(grunting)
278,00:11:58.27,00:11:58.27,So I'm a littlefreaked out right now.
279,00:12:00.93,00:12:00.93,(anxious laugh)
280,00:12:02.40,00:12:02.40,And I've really got to goto the bathroom.
281,00:12:04.37,00:12:04.37,-You afraid?-Yeah.
282,00:12:06.53,00:12:06.53," So we run over, trying to get away from the bats..."
283,00:12:09.73,00:12:09.73,I just-- I see somethingglowing out there.
284,00:12:11.73,00:12:11.73, ...and here are these sets
285,00:12:13.00,00:12:13.00, of glowing eyes just staring at us.
286,00:12:15.57,00:12:15.57,-You see it?-Yep.
287,00:12:17.20,00:12:17.20,Do you want to go down thereto go to the bathroom?
288,00:12:21.43,00:12:21.43,You can hold it?
289,00:12:23.23,00:12:23.23,Yes.
290,00:12:24.63,00:12:24.63,"I'm sorry,I'm just a little freaked."
291,00:12:26.67,00:12:26.67,"-Come on, let's walk down here.-No."
292,00:12:28.47,00:12:28.47,Come down hereand I'll dig a hole.
293,00:12:31.00,00:12:31.00,No.
294,00:12:32.17,00:12:32.17,HEIDI: There is a million and one things
295,00:12:33.77,00:12:33.77, to fear in this environment.
296,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30," And when it's in the dark, it's just scary."

300,00:12:50.03,00:12:50.03,Sure.
301,00:12:52.07,00:12:52.07,"I don't, I don't..."
302,00:12:54.77,00:12:54.77,"If you, if you--"
303,00:12:56.43,00:12:56.43,I'll go do it.
304,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10,ROGER: It really got me hot.
305,00:13:03.00,00:13:03.00,"I-- tempted to slap the kidaround, to be honest with you."
306,00:13:05.07,00:13:05.07,DANIEL: Roger-- he just barks orders all the time.
307,00:13:08.70,00:13:08.70,"I mean, he's notvery friendly about it."
308,00:13:10.10,00:13:10.10,He just tells people what to do.
309,00:13:11.77,00:13:11.77," Uh, I'm not really speaking to Roger right now."

313,00:13:23.53,00:13:23.53,"I, um, initiate Deena."
314,00:13:25.20,00:13:25.20,Do you accept the offer?
315,00:13:28.07,00:13:28.07,"You know, I'm gonna--"

317,00:13:31.30,00:13:31.30,that are important for the day.
318,00:13:33.20,00:13:33.20,DEENA: I didn't take that with open arms
319,00:13:34.83,00:13:34.83,because that putsa big target on your body.
320,00:13:36.80,00:13:36.80,And who wants to getvoted out of the game?
321,00:13:38.93,00:13:38.93," But, yes, I am going to do it."

325,00:14:06.80,00:14:06.80,DEENA: The net effect of the leadership has been that
326,00:14:08.90,00:14:08.90, the camp looks like it's organized.
327,00:14:11.20,00:14:11.20,"Like, it looks as if somebody,yes, lives there and cares about"
328,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37,their environmentand is going to take care of it.
329,00:14:16.40,00:14:16.40," It was what we needed to get us at par,"
330,00:14:19.27,00:14:19.27,so that we could play the gameagainst the men.
331,00:14:21.53,00:14:21.53,-Go!-Here it is.
332,00:14:23.30,00:14:23.30,Don't pull it yet.

367,00:15:46.13,00:15:46.13, We need four.

380,00:16:14.27,00:16:14.27,I'm going to bring this in here.
381,00:16:18.00,00:16:18.00, One thing that I try to do consistently through this game

394,00:16:50.60,00:16:50.60, I think that maybe they're going to weigh it out
395,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33, and decide that the guy that does

397,00:16:54.70,00:16:54.70,as the guythat catches the fish.

411,00:17:25.50,00:17:25.50, And Shawna was ready to call it quits.
412,00:17:27.87,00:17:27.87,"After we lost that Coke, it tookeverything in my entire brain"
413,00:17:31.43,00:17:31.43,to not make my body just wantto just sit on the sand
414,00:17:34.40,00:17:34.40,"and be, like, I have to takea three-hour break."
415,00:17:37.23,00:17:37.23,I don't see myselflasting for 30 more days.
416,00:17:39.87,00:17:39.87,Are you at this pointright this very moment
417,00:17:41.33,00:17:41.33,"where you say, ""I want out""?"
418,00:17:43.40,00:17:43.40,"If we were going tonight,"
419,00:17:44.73,00:17:44.73,I would be very temptedto get out.
420,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,"Yeah, I don't knowthat I could do it."
421,00:17:53.60,00:17:53.60,PROBST: Shawna sat out the next challenge and watched...
422,00:17:56.33,00:17:56.33,No! No!
423,00:17:57.57,00:17:57.57,-Ah! Damn you!-(groaning)
424,00:17:58.93,00:17:58.93, ...as the men fished their way to immunity.
425,00:18:03.63,00:18:03.63,"Tambaqui, congratulations."
426,00:18:05.57,00:18:05.57,Yeah!
427,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67," Even though Shawna was weak,"
428,00:18:11.00,00:18:11.00," the alliance of Deena, Heidi and Jenna"
429,00:18:13.60,00:18:13.60, planned to keep her trapped in the Amazon.
430,00:18:16.43,00:18:16.43,DEENA: I feel a tremendous amount of compassion for her.
431,00:18:18.83,00:18:18.83,"But at the same time,you have an agreement."
432,00:18:20.50,00:18:20.50,And I don't want to get screwedto help her out.
433,00:18:22.50,00:18:22.50,Joanna is clearly
434,00:18:23.93,00:18:23.93, the most physical person that we have on this team.
435,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83," She has too much power, too much force."
436,00:18:29.17,00:18:29.17,"Shawna, guess what?"
437,00:18:30.57,00:18:30.57,You're not in charge here.
438,00:18:31.90,00:18:31.90, It's about the core alliance.
439,00:18:33.63,00:18:33.63," Suck it up, baby, 'cause you're along for the ride."
440,00:18:37.60,00:18:37.60,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, despite Shawna's weakness,"
441,00:18:39.33,00:18:39.33, the alliance voted Joanna out of the tribe.
442,00:18:42.93,00:18:42.93,Joanna.Need to bring me your torch.
443,00:18:45.10,00:18:45.10,JOANNA: I didn't expect to be voted off that night.
444,00:18:47.40,00:18:47.40, I knew that
445,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,Deena would come after me
446,00:18:49.80,00:18:49.80,because I was-- my presencewas very strong there.
447,00:18:52.00,00:18:52.00,"Joanna, the tribe has spoken."
448,00:18:55.77,00:18:55.77," The water's nasty, I'm struggling,"
449,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,"I don't have any help out here,"
450,00:18:59.60,00:18:59.60,"nobody's fishing, everybody'slaying down looking crazy,"
451,00:19:02.00,00:19:02.00,"it's hot, I'm hungry."
452,00:19:03.63,00:19:03.63," I felt like I was playing the physical aspect,"
453,00:19:05.87,00:19:05.87,the survival aspect of the game by myself.
454,00:19:13.90,00:19:13.90,"PROBST: The next morning, Christy proved"
455,00:19:15.97,00:19:15.97, the women could still provide for themselves.
456,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90,"CHRISTY: Today, I kind of felt like,"
457,00:19:20.77,00:19:20.77," kind of cool, you know,  and so I go out, I go fishing,"
458,00:19:23.63,00:19:23.63,"and bam, bam, bam, I catch fish,"
459,00:19:25.37,00:19:25.37,and I provide lunchfor the tribe.
460,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53, And it really does
461,00:19:30.87,00:19:30.87,"make you feel good, you know."
462,00:19:32.40,00:19:32.40,It feels good knowingthat you can actually
463,00:19:34.83,00:19:34.83," get food for somebody, you know?"
464,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17, So we can survive without Joanna.
465,00:19:44.07,00:19:44.07,Jeanne and Shawnaare commiserating.
466,00:19:46.27,00:19:46.27,"Is that like,discussing, arguing?"
467,00:19:49.10,00:19:49.10,"No, feeling really badfor each other."
468,00:19:51.47,00:19:51.47,"CHRISTY: Really? -""I'm sorrythat Joanna's gone, I'm sorry"
469,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,"-that you're still here.""-Still here."
470,00:19:55.10,00:19:55.10,"""I never would have let youstay here."""
471,00:19:56.87,00:19:56.87,"Blah, blah, blah."

473,00:19:59.37,00:19:59.37,DEENA:Commiserate.
474,00:20:00.47,00:20:00.47,Commiserate.
475,00:20:03.40,00:20:03.40,JEANNE: I'm not goingto roll over and die because
476,00:20:05.90,00:20:05.90,Joanna's not here.
477,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80,"I mean, I think you should havebeen voted off."
478,00:20:10.40,00:20:10.40,As much as I love you--I think you're the greatest kid
479,00:20:12.37,00:20:12.37,"in the world, you know I do."
480,00:20:13.53,00:20:13.53,"No. Actually, it's a good point."
481,00:20:14.80,00:20:14.80,I know exactlywhat you're saying now...
482,00:20:16.13,00:20:16.13,JEANNE: I think we needas much energy as we can get.
483,00:20:18.43,00:20:18.43,-And you don't have it.-I agree. I agree.
484,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,Maybe the tribe has a planthat they didn't share with me.
485,00:20:24.10,00:20:24.10,"PROBST: Frustrated by Joanna's departure,"
486,00:20:26.70,00:20:26.70, Jeanne cooked up a plot for revenge.
487,00:20:29.07,00:20:29.07,"JEANNE: Mentally, I'm right there."
488,00:20:31.47,00:20:31.47," Joanna leaving made me sad, but you know what?"
489,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50," In honor of her, I'm going to kick their butts."
490,00:20:35.93,00:20:35.93, She would like that.
491,00:20:37.13,00:20:37.13,One meatball.
492,00:20:38.70,00:20:38.70," I, uh, cooked the fish, and then they all wanted manioc."
493,00:20:42.07,00:20:42.07," And I opened the lid on our container of manioc,"
494,00:20:44.63,00:20:44.63, and it contained
495,00:20:45.80,00:20:45.80,"pink fuzz, green fuzz."
496,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,I saw
497,00:20:49.73,00:20:49.73," white maggots, ants, skinny little worms."
498,00:20:53.97,00:20:53.97, Half the barrel is mush.
499,00:20:55.57,00:20:55.57,"Good eating.Good eating, folks."
500,00:20:57.63,00:20:57.63, And I knew how to cook it so that they would like it.
501,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37," I went in, got a little of the mushy stuff,"
502,00:21:03.10,00:21:03.10,dipped itinto the crunchy stuff.
503,00:21:04.50,00:21:04.50,"Got a little green mold,a little pink mold"
504,00:21:06.17,00:21:06.17, and kind of rolled it all together into
505,00:21:09.17,00:21:09.17," little hot dog, bite-size morsels, and..."
506,00:21:12.40,00:21:12.40, kind of dried them slowly over the ashes.
507,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,"Meatballs are cooking, girls."
508,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,All right!
509,00:21:18.53,00:21:18.53,And they're gonna be... great!

512,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,like beef stewand your mom's biscuits.
513,00:21:28.17,00:21:28.17,They devoured them.
514,00:21:29.37,00:21:29.37, They thought they were sesame treats.
515,00:21:31.20,00:21:31.20,Excellent.
516,00:21:32.40,00:21:32.40,"-God bless you.-CHRISTY: Mmm, Jeanne!"
517,00:21:34.80,00:21:34.80,-This is the ticket.-DEENA: This really is too good.
518,00:21:36.30,00:21:36.30,I wouldn't eat oneif you paid me.
519,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17," Hopefully, they'll all keel over."
520,00:21:40.93,00:21:40.93," -They might. -Mm, wonderful."
521,00:21:42.80,00:21:42.80,-I could eat this all day.-Mm-hmm.

531,00:22:20.93,00:22:20.93, to actually talkto someone of the opposite sex.
532,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"We were, like, readyto just, like, chat away."
533,00:22:26.73,00:22:26.73,DAVE: Jenna did go into great detail
534,00:22:29.07,00:22:29.07, about the status of her tribe.
535,00:22:31.93,00:22:31.93,"Heidi, who I've becomereally close to..."

539,00:22:39.40,00:22:39.40,She doesn't want to be here.
540,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,We just keep her on the tribe.

804,00:33:09.20,00:33:09.20,which really pisses me offbecause
805,00:33:10.37,00:33:10.37,I really would liketo be a part it.

807,00:33:12.87,00:33:12.87, everything was falling into place.
808,00:33:14.53,00:33:14.53,"ROGER: Yeah, we got six guys and four girls,"
809,00:33:16.60,00:33:16.60,"and our original game plan was,"

814,00:33:27.93,00:33:27.93,DEENA: But you understandwhat we have to do.
815,00:33:30.80,00:33:30.80,We have to startpicking off the stronger males.

821,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,ALEX: Roger is of the belief
822,00:33:45.57,00:33:45.57," that we are all, um... allthe guys are together, and, um,"
823,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,"unless he winsindividual immunity,"
824,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,he'll be the first one to go.

836,00:34:26.40,00:34:26.40,"I would say, yeah,I-I probably do."
837,00:34:28.67,00:34:28.67,"You know, obviously,if I really felt"
838,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,"that I needed that immunity,I would have given it my all."
839,00:34:35.07,00:34:35.07,PROBST: ...and was blindsided
840,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20, when seven votes came up with his name on them.
841,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,ROGER: I was a cocky...
842,00:34:42.33,00:34:42.33," You know, and I still am."
843,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20," You never lose that self-confidence,"

847,00:34:55.73,00:34:55.73, goes away.
848,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,"Roger, the tribe has spoken."
849,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,"ROGER: I came to win the game, but"
850,00:35:02.07,00:35:02.07,I wasn't deceptive enough.
851,00:35:03.40,00:35:03.40, I should've bit my tongue and laid low.
852,00:35:06.33,00:35:06.33, I should've not exuded that confidence.
853,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,"And, uh, I've no oneto blame but myself."
854,00:35:11.33,00:35:11.33, They were better than I am at the game.
855,00:35:19.93,00:35:19.93,"PROBST: The next morning, Dave pondered his new situation."
856,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,DAVE: What happened last night
857,00:35:25.47,00:35:25.47, was an interesting turn of events.
858,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,All my stability and everything
859,00:35:29.80,00:35:29.80," has now been turned upside down,"
860,00:35:32.50,00:35:32.50, because I did put my roots into an alliance with Roger.
861,00:35:36.20,00:35:36.20, Now...
862,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,I gotta play the game accordingto how things are right now.
863,00:35:41.27,00:35:41.27,PROBST:  Dave tried to prove
864,00:35:42.77,00:35:42.77, he was still valuable to the tribe.
865,00:35:45.13,00:35:45.13,"DAVE: Hopefully, just being a hard worker and dedicated,"
866,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17, motivated and fun to be with
867,00:35:49.37,00:35:49.37,will keep me aroundfor a little bit longer
868,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60," and start building, uh, some alliances"
869,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17, with the people who are left.
870,00:35:55.23,00:35:55.23,"PROBST: That evening, while tending the fire,"
871,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50, Dave pleaded his case
872,00:35:58.87,00:35:58.87, to Christy and tried to swing her vote.
873,00:36:02.27,00:36:02.27,I felt guilty in a lotof the way I acted at Tambaqui.
874,00:36:06.50,00:36:06.50,That's kind of why I wanted
875,00:36:07.83,00:36:07.83,to have fire dutywith you tonight.
876,00:36:09.80,00:36:09.80,(whispering): I voted for youlast time and I felt bad.
877,00:36:13.13,00:36:13.13," You know, at my point,"
878,00:36:14.63,00:36:14.63," it's cleaning the slate, making sure"
879,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43," that nobody's harboring any hard feelings,"
880,00:36:18.30,00:36:18.30,"and, uh, also, you know,maybe get a vote or two."
881,00:36:21.33,00:36:21.33,"I'm a little stronger thansome people, so I'm competition."
882,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,Yeah.
883,00:36:26.23,00:36:26.23,People want to get rid of me.
884,00:36:28.43,00:36:28.43,"And, uh, it kind of sucks."
885,00:36:31.63,00:36:31.63," Shortly thereafter,"
886,00:36:32.93,00:36:32.93, Christy said how much she loved to dance.
887,00:36:34.47,00:36:34.47,"I happen to also like to dance,"
888,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"and when I asked herif she knew how to swing dance,"
889,00:36:38.67,00:36:38.67,she responded that she only knewhow to salsa.
890,00:36:40.70,00:36:40.70,(whispering):Swing dancing is on six beats
891,00:36:42.53,00:36:42.53,"instead of four beats, right?"
892,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,Okay.
893,00:36:45.40,00:36:45.40,DAVE: So I took the opportunity
894,00:36:46.57,00:36:46.57,to teach hera little swing dancing.
895,00:36:47.87,00:36:47.87,"-(snoring) -DAVE: The guy leads,and the girl follows,"
896,00:36:52.47,00:36:52.47,"and it has to work like that,"
897,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,"because if we both try to lead,it's not gonna work."
898,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,-(Christy whispers)-Right.
899,00:36:58.60,00:36:58.60,"So, in this case,it works pretty good"
900,00:37:00.97,00:37:00.97,"'cause I know what I'm doing,"
901,00:37:02.63,00:37:02.63,and you don't knowwhat you're doing.
902,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,"So, for you,the beat is one, two..."
903,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,All right.
904,00:37:12.50,00:37:12.50,"Over here, like this."
905,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,"-Piece of cake, right?No problem? -Yeah."
906,00:37:22.17,00:37:22.17,So now that we got that...
907,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,Or we can do this.
908,00:37:37.80,00:37:37.80,Yeah. Not too bad.
909,00:37:39.73,00:37:39.73,Yeah.
910,00:37:41.10,00:37:41.10,"CHRISTY: It was a fun fire watch, you know?"
911,00:37:43.07,00:37:43.07, It was entertaining.
912,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43," Dave, in general, seemed like a really good guy,"
913,00:37:46.80,00:37:46.80, but I-I think he was exaggerating a little bit
914,00:37:51.07,00:37:51.07, on how much he really appreciates me.
915,00:37:53.30,00:37:53.30,That's it.So now you're a pro.
916,00:37:55.63,00:37:55.63,"CHRISTY: If you really appreciate me,"
917,00:37:57.57,00:37:57.57,maybe you could show thata little bit throughout the game
918,00:38:00.13,00:38:00.13,"instead of, like, the day before"
919,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,you think you're goingto get voted off.
920,00:38:07.53,00:38:07.53,"PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Dave needed to win."
921,00:38:10.83,00:38:10.83,It's payback.
922,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,PROBST: But his hopes were smashed
923,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53, when he was taken out early.
924,00:38:15.80,00:38:15.80, Jenna was the last one standing.
925,00:38:19.30,00:38:19.30,"So at Tribal Council, Dave made a final plea to the tribe."
926,00:38:23.97,00:38:23.97,DAVE:These next three days
927,00:38:25.73,00:38:25.73,"are... are importantto me, and, um,"
928,00:38:27.93,00:38:27.93,and I would like to spend themwith the-the eight people
929,00:38:30.20,00:38:30.20,that are sitting downhere in front of me.
930,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,"PROBST: But it wasn't enough,"
931,00:38:33.37,00:38:33.37, as eight votes made him the first member of the jury.
932,00:38:36.03,00:38:36.03, DAVE: I guess that's what really kind of caught me
933,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97," surprised when I finally realized that,"
934,00:38:40.20,00:38:40.20,"you know,I am perceived as a threat."
935,00:38:42.40,00:38:42.40," It was, ""Wait a minute.  Now I'm the bad guy."""
936,00:38:44.80,00:38:44.80,"Dave, the tribe has spoken."
937,00:38:47.07,00:38:47.07,DAVE: My case is a prime example how it is very difficult
938,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,to plan any morethan a few days in advance.
939,00:38:54.97,00:38:54.97," I miscalculated and found myself walking on thin ice,"
940,00:38:58.93,00:38:58.93, and it broke and sent me home.

946,00:39:16.60,00:39:16.60,Matt's not in the picture.
947,00:39:17.83,00:39:17.83,I understand that.

949,00:39:24.27,00:39:24.27,"It seems to me, if Matt winsimmunity, then Alex has to go."

954,00:39:39.70,00:39:39.70," So, I mean, I just told Jenna about it,"
955,00:39:42.23,00:39:42.23,and I knew she'd speakto Alex about it.
956,00:39:44.33,00:39:44.33,She's... turned on us.
957,00:39:46.20,00:39:46.20,"So, we need to get her off."
958,00:39:49.00,00:39:49.00,Deena stabbed us all in the backbecause she's being selfish.
959,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47,I'm really pissed at her.
