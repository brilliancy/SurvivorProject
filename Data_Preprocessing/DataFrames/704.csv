2,00:00:02.47,00:00:02.47,Survivor... The Morgan Tribe was in a slump
3,00:00:04.50,00:00:04.50,after Osten asked to be voted out.
4,00:00:06.27,00:00:06.27,>> He quit. >> I think there's a big
5,00:00:08.33,00:00:08.33,difference between quitting and pulling the trigger
6,00:00:09.87,00:00:09.87,and actually quitting. >> PROBST: The Drake Tribe
7,00:00:11.23,00:00:11.23,searched for buried treasure with the first piece
8,00:00:13.50,00:00:13.50,"of their map, but came up empty-handed."
9,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77,">> Hopefully, get another piece of the map today, so we can get"
10,00:00:17.73,00:00:17.73,the next clue. >> PROBST: After reward
11,00:00:19.70,00:00:19.70,"challenge, the two tribes battled for new bedding,"
12,00:00:22.13,00:00:22.13,a piece of their treasure map and a chance to loot
13,00:00:24.67,00:00:24.67,the losing tribe. Go!
14,00:00:26.13,00:00:26.13,"With the help of Rupert's brute strength,"
15,00:00:28.73,00:00:28.73,the Drakes stayed afloat and won their fourth challenge
16,00:00:30.53,00:00:30.53,in a row. (cheering)
17,00:00:33.07,00:00:33.07,"Making matters worse for Morgan, Lill lost the tribe's last"
18,00:00:37.27,00:00:37.27,"fishing hook. >> Oh, I'm gone for good now."
19,00:00:40.13,00:00:40.13,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, with Darrah and"
20,00:00:42.20,00:00:42.20,"Michelle hanging in the balance, it came down to a test"
21,00:00:44.97,00:00:44.97,of strength and will between Rupert and Osten.
22,00:00:48.53,00:00:48.53,But Rupert held on and secured another Drake victory.
23,00:00:51.60,00:00:51.60,"(shouting) At Tribal Council,"
24,00:00:54.57,00:00:54.57,Morgan chose Darrah's strength over the scoutmaster's work
25,00:00:57.77,00:00:57.77,ethic. And Lill was voted out
26,00:01:00.43,00:01:00.43,of the tribe. 13 Are left.
27,00:01:02.97,00:01:02.97,Who will be voted out tonight? \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

29,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,"bit, uh, higher tides 'cause there's the storm"
30,00:02:33.40,00:02:33.40,"out at sea. So, it kind of blew our"
31,00:02:35.63,00:02:35.63,"little fortress wall away. It seems like, as the month"
32,00:02:38.27,00:02:38.27,"is going on, the tides are getting"
33,00:02:40.83,00:02:40.83,"higher and higher. So, the wall needs"
34,00:02:42.83,00:02:42.83,"to be bigger and bigger. Otherwise, we're going"
35,00:02:45.30,00:02:45.30,"to need to move our shelter somewhere else, and I really"
36,00:02:48.17,00:02:48.17,don't want to do that. Put the whole sand wall
37,00:02:50.80,00:02:50.80,right across here. We need to just reinforce it.
38,00:02:57.80,00:02:57.80,We're in an uphill fight and we have been ever since
39,00:03:00.93,00:03:00.93,we got here. It's almost comical now.
40,00:03:05.70,00:03:05.70,">> Think about a double barrier, so we got... you know, right"
41,00:03:08.87,00:03:08.87,here the last wall of defense. We are absolutely devastated.
42,00:03:16.87,00:03:16.87,"Our morale is low. We, at Tribal Council last"
43,00:03:19.63,00:03:19.63,"night, voted out Lill. We definitely feel the impact"
44,00:03:22.07,00:03:22.07,"of her not being there. >> Oh, yeah."
45,00:03:23.97,00:03:23.97,">> Okay, it's ready? >> Yeah."
46,00:03:25.90,00:03:25.90,">> Darrah and T are taking over the, uh, water responsibilities."
47,00:03:29.40,00:03:29.40,"I think it's us against everything else out here,"
48,00:03:31.93,00:03:31.93,"against the surf, against the mosquitoes,"
49,00:03:34.23,00:03:34.23,against the crabs. >> This is a crab that we found
50,00:03:37.97,00:03:37.97,under our bed. >> They were trying to get us
51,00:03:40.07,00:03:40.07,"last night... from underneath. >> Against the fire ants,"
52,00:03:42.83,00:03:42.83,everything. >> Are those fire ants?
53,00:03:44.97,00:03:44.97,"I think they are. There's, like, a log"
54,00:03:47.60,00:03:47.60,where they live and they're being smoked out
55,00:03:49.53,00:03:49.53,and coming out all over our camp.
56,00:03:51.97,00:03:51.97,">> We desperately need fish. The, uh, coconut, rice"
57,00:03:56.13,00:03:56.13,"and beans, I mean, it's sufficient for now,"
58,00:03:58.90,00:03:58.90,but we really need just that extra boost.
59,00:04:00.53,00:04:00.53,"Also, from a morale standpoint, it would be a huge victory"
60,00:04:03.30,00:04:03.30,"for us to actually catch a fish. >> Jon, need any help?"
61,00:04:20.03,00:04:20.03,>> I filled everyone in on the status of...
62,00:04:21.90,00:04:21.90,"of the jug all day. >> Dude, I know, I..."
63,00:04:23.77,00:04:23.77,">> And the day before. >> Jon, I... I'm not..."
64,00:04:25.30,00:04:25.30,>> You knew it had to be done and you want to tell
65,00:04:27.37,00:04:27.37,"everyone else it should have been done, and... and you said"
66,00:04:28.93,00:04:28.93,"three hours ago, then you could have done it."
67,00:04:30.83,00:04:30.83,"So, then don't complain about it."
68,00:04:32.53,00:04:32.53,>> I've been doing everything else.
69,00:04:33.87,00:04:33.87,>> That's not my point. Everyone else has been doing...
70,00:04:35.43,00:04:35.43,"what are you saying? >> I am, mad, because everyone"
71,00:04:36.90,00:04:36.90,"else... >> Yeah, we took a rest"
72,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,because it's hot today. >> I know.
73,00:04:39.97,00:04:39.97,>> Are you trying to say you're the only one who does
74,00:04:41.80,00:04:41.80,"something around here? >> Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
75,00:04:43.57,00:04:43.57,">> So then, what's your problem? >> I'm saying that a little more"
76,00:04:46.37,00:04:46.37,help would be appreciated. I've been working for three
77,00:04:47.83,00:04:47.83,hours. This is the first time
78,00:04:49.73,00:04:49.73,I stopped working to complain about it.
79,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,It's not a big deal. That's the problem.
80,00:04:55.23,00:04:55.23,">> Okay. >> You know, the mood today"
81,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"has been really funky, I think. It's been really weird."
82,00:05:03.00,00:05:03.00,"You know, I think people are getting testy,"
83,00:05:05.33,00:05:05.33,"and they're just sort of, you know..."
84,00:05:06.80,00:05:06.80,we've been out here for ten days and the personalities are
85,00:05:09.27,00:05:09.27,starting to get to one another a little bit.
86,00:05:11.13,00:05:11.13,"And morale for some reason, today, has been really off and"
87,00:05:14.57,00:05:14.57,"on, and I can't figure out why. >> You hear what Shawn said"
88,00:05:16.93,00:05:16.93,this morning that him and Burton are always the first ones to
89,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,"wake up and to do everything? That's a bunch of baloney,"
90,00:05:21.47,00:05:21.47,'cause they're rarely the first ones up.
91,00:05:23.57,00:05:23.57,I woke up happy until I heard that crap.
92,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,">> I think because, uh, we've won so many challenges,"
93,00:05:30.60,00:05:30.60,it's starting to get annoying. Because we really want
94,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,"somebody to leave. Did you go to college, Shawn?"
95,00:05:37.10,00:05:37.10,>> What's that? >> Did you go to college?
96,00:05:38.77,00:05:38.77,">> Yes, I did. >> Did you graduate?"
97,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,">> Yes, I did. How about yourself?"
98,00:05:42.60,00:05:42.60,Did you graduate? >> Mm-hmm.
99,00:05:44.37,00:05:44.37,>> There's definitely tension. Christa's always had her
100,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"little issues with me, and, you know, she's made"
101,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,"her little comments, things that just get on my nerve"
102,00:05:50.80,00:05:50.80,and I've just smiled right through them and not said
103,00:05:53.07,00:05:53.07,"anything back. But, at the same time,"
104,00:05:54.90,00:05:54.90,I take note of everything. What you say is going
105,00:05:57.10,00:05:57.10,"to come back to get you, and in this case,"
106,00:05:59.30,00:05:59.30,"it's coming back to get her. >> These guys that are here,"
107,00:06:02.10,00:06:02.10,"especially Shawn and Michelle and Burton, I just don't"
108,00:06:05.80,00:06:05.80,get along with them. I don't feel the connection
109,00:06:07.60,00:06:07.60,with them. I don't feel like I can
110,00:06:09.90,00:06:09.90,speak my mind like I normally can.
111,00:06:13.20,00:06:13.20,And I'd rather have them out of here.
112,00:06:14.87,00:06:14.87,">> Dude, just, whatever you do, say no to crack."
113,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"(laughs) Nothing, dude."
114,00:06:22.53,00:06:22.53,>> I'll kill you. >> Some plumbers wear skirts.
115,00:06:24.67,00:06:24.67,>> I'll kill you! >> Some plumbers wear skirts.
116,00:06:26.70,00:06:26.70,>> Son of a bitch. Snap your neck like
117,00:06:28.77,00:06:28.77,"a damn chicken! You know, I don't know,"
118,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,I turned around and Burton's pointing at my ass
119,00:06:34.50,00:06:34.50,and laughing at me and just being an idiot.
120,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,"You know, it's like high school."
121,00:06:38.27,00:06:38.27,The... the pretty boy jock-ass idiots all got
122,00:06:40.87,00:06:40.87,to pick on me. >> Rupe.
123,00:06:43.50,00:06:43.50,">> Rupe. Rupe. Rupe. You know, you're the prettiest"
124,00:06:46.70,00:06:46.70,one in a skirt around here. >> The whole time we've been
125,00:06:50.27,00:06:50.27,"here, Shawn and Burton and Michelle kind of cliqued up"
126,00:06:53.63,00:06:53.63,"right away, and, you know, I don't know why they did that."
127,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27,I can only assume that the two guys thought
128,00:06:57.83,00:06:57.83,"they were just so strong, that there's no way they were"
129,00:07:00.27,00:07:00.27,"going to get voted off. And, of course, Michelle's"
130,00:07:01.90,00:07:01.90,"adorable, and so they cliqued right into her."
131,00:07:03.63,00:07:03.63,But I don't think they realize that they alienated everybody
132,00:07:07.20,00:07:07.20,"else in the tribe. >> PROBST: Drake, here's your"
133,00:07:25.03,00:07:25.03,first look at the new Morgan Tribe minus another member.
134,00:07:28.83,00:07:28.83,"Lill, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
135,00:07:30.73,00:07:30.73,How you guys doing? >> Great.
136,00:07:33.80,00:07:33.80,">> PROBST: Okay. For today's reward challenge,"
137,00:07:36.03,00:07:36.03,you're going to be solving a puzzle.
138,00:07:37.53,00:07:37.53,There are 16 pieces to the puzzle.
139,00:07:40.23,00:07:40.23,"Eight are buried in the sand, eight are floating in the water."
140,00:07:43.50,00:07:43.50,"One tribe member at a time, you're going to retrieve"
141,00:07:46.23,00:07:46.23,a piece from either the water or the sand in any order you
142,00:07:49.13,00:07:49.13,"want. Once you have all 16 pieces,"
143,00:07:51.77,00:07:51.77,the entire tribe can then begin to solve the puzzle.
144,00:07:54.77,00:07:54.77,First tribe to finish the puzzle wins reward.
145,00:07:57.33,00:07:57.33,Want to know what you're playing for?
146,00:07:58.67,00:07:58.67,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Got something a
147,00:08:00.87,00:08:00.87,little different this time. To help you out
148,00:08:03.27,00:08:03.27,"with your wardrobe, old-fashioned sewing machine,"
149,00:08:07.23,00:08:07.23,along with a sewing kit. >> Make me a new dress.
150,00:08:10.67,00:08:10.67,>> PROBST: We've got all kinds of material.
151,00:08:12.20,00:08:12.20,"In addition, another piece to the location"
152,00:08:16.23,00:08:16.23,"of your treasure chest. For Drake, it would be your"
153,00:08:20.00,00:08:20.00,"third and final piece. Morgan, it would be"
154,00:08:22.43,00:08:22.43,"your first piece. Finally, the opportunity to loot"
155,00:08:25.13,00:08:25.13,one item from the other tribe. Worth playing for?
156,00:08:28.07,00:08:28.07,">> ALL: Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, Drake,"
157,00:08:30.33,00:08:30.33,"because you have three extra members, you're sitting three"
158,00:08:32.87,00:08:32.87,people out in this challenge. Who are you sitting out?
159,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,"Shawn, Michelle, Christa, take a spot on the bench."
160,00:08:37.93,00:08:37.93,"Wait for my ""go."" For reward, survivors ready?"
161,00:08:45.07,00:08:45.07,Go! Ryno and Burton
162,00:08:47.97,00:08:47.97,"starting out the race. Burton, with his first piece,"
163,00:09:01.07,00:09:01.07,"heading back in. >> Way to go, Burton!"
164,00:09:06.37,00:09:06.37,>> PROBST: Burton with the first piece for Drake.

166,00:09:11.93,00:09:11.93,Sandra. >> PROBST: Sandra gets the first
167,00:09:14.10,00:09:14.10,piece from the sand. That's two for Drake.

239,00:13:43.57,00:13:43.57,It's a big belly to move around. >> You could have made shorts.

241,00:13:49.37,00:13:49.37,>> I love the sewing machine. We couldn't have gotten

243,00:13:54.63,00:13:54.63,He's the only man that I know that would wear a skirt
244,00:13:56.97,00:13:56.97,"out in the middle of nowhere just to be comfortable,"
245,00:13:58.83,00:13:58.83,and he's the only man I know that would start sewing away
246,00:14:01.37,00:14:01.37,and have no shame. All he has
247,00:14:03.17,00:14:03.17,"is pride in his skills, and I think it's awesome"
248,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17,that he actually knows how to make his own clothes.
249,00:14:09.57,00:14:09.57,">> Hey, look at this guy over here, Mr. Sewer."

254,00:14:29.37,00:14:29.37,>> Good for you. You can get right on that.
255,00:14:31.83,00:14:31.83,>> Burton and Shawn never leave Rupert alone about his skirt.
256,00:14:38.27,00:14:38.27,"I mean, don't keep talking about something"
257,00:14:39.93,00:14:39.93,"that keeps bothering somebody. If you know it bothers somebody,"
258,00:14:42.60,00:14:42.60,why don't you just shut up after awhile?
259,00:14:44.57,00:14:44.57,">> Look at that, you tied a string in there and everything,"
260,00:14:46.10,00:14:46.10,huh? >> It's like a muumuu.
261,00:14:48.57,00:14:48.57,>> That is awesome. (laughter)
262,00:14:50.20,00:14:50.20,">> Oh, God. >> How's that feel?"
263,00:14:54.20,00:14:54.20,">> Much better, huh? >> Much better."
264,00:14:55.87,00:14:55.87,"I feel lots better. >> All right, guys, listen up."

272,00:15:23.90,00:15:23.90,"I know where that is, baby. >> So, after the last reward"
273,00:15:26.83,00:15:26.83,"challenge, we finally got our third and final piece of our map"
274,00:15:29.70,00:15:29.70,"for the treasure chest, and we were just bouncing off"
275,00:15:32.60,00:15:32.60,the walls ready to find it. >> I'm hoping there's candy
276,00:15:35.30,00:15:35.30,and maybe some canned juice and peaches and pineapples
277,00:15:38.10,00:15:38.10,"in there, I don't know. Anything but rice-- if I see"
278,00:15:40.90,00:15:40.90,"one more grain of rice, I'm gonna... I'll be upset."
279,00:15:43.87,00:15:43.87,"I'm gonna go wild. >> We talk about the treasure,"
280,00:15:47.37,00:15:47.37,"we dream about the treasure, we fantasize about the treasure."
281,00:15:50.30,00:15:50.30,"Like, I've had more, uh, wet dreams about that..."
282,00:15:52.63,00:15:52.63,"that treasure than, uh... than any girl in Playboy."
283,00:15:56.77,00:15:56.77,"(chuckles) >> Rupe, anything?"
284,00:16:04.77,00:16:04.77,>> No. >> I bet it's here.
285,00:16:09.53,00:16:09.53,It's got to be here. It's out all by itself?
286,00:16:14.87,00:16:14.87,">> I don't know, that, to me, looks like a fork out"
287,00:16:17.40,00:16:17.40,"in the open, to be honest. >> Why is this not jumping out?"
288,00:16:21.10,00:16:21.10,>> Look at this map. Come back here and
289,00:16:22.93,00:16:22.93,look at this map. >> We have not found it yet.
290,00:16:24.93,00:16:24.93,We're still back to the same dilemma we've been in
291,00:16:27.03,00:16:27.03,"the whole time, which is... the directions say"
292,00:16:29.93,00:16:29.93,"""find the devil's fork."" The clues say ""go 15 paces"

294,00:16:38.50,00:16:38.50,"due north, but there's no obvious ""devil's fork"" out here."
295,00:16:41.83,00:16:41.83,>> Does that look like a devil's fork to you?
296,00:16:46.73,00:16:46.73,"If you think of what's in here, there's nothing else"
297,00:16:49.63,00:16:49.63,as big and obtrusive as that thing right there.
298,00:16:53.97,00:16:53.97,>> I'm buying that. >> What?
299,00:16:55.57,00:16:55.57,>> What about over here? >> It is really soft.
300,00:17:05.47,00:17:05.47,>> Feeling anything? (gasps)
301,00:17:09.97,00:17:09.97,Is that it? >> That seems like wood.
302,00:17:12.07,00:17:12.07,"Dude, I think this might be it. Look, there's metal, see?"
303,00:17:17.33,00:17:17.33,>> Woo-hoo! Keep digging! Keep digging!
304,00:17:20.67,00:17:20.67,>> I think I got it! >> We got it!
305,00:17:22.37,00:17:22.37,>> I got it! >> It's over here!
306,00:17:25.90,00:17:25.90,">> So, show me the devil's fork."
307,00:17:27.37,00:17:27.37,">> It's right there. >> Right there, baby."
308,00:17:28.90,00:17:28.90,>> At that big tree. >> Look at it from the other
309,00:17:30.60,00:17:30.60,"side. >> Shawn, you're a god!"
310,00:17:33.00,00:17:33.00,">> Yeah, baby! >> We've won three challenges,"
311,00:17:36.10,00:17:36.10,we've gotten three maps. We searched this island
312,00:17:39.13,00:17:39.13,"high and low, and here it was. We were standing"
313,00:17:41.50,00:17:41.50,on the freakin' treasure. >> Barbecued potato chips!
314,00:17:44.67,00:17:44.67,>> Eight pair of pants. >> Bacon cheeseburgers!
315,00:17:48.27,00:17:48.27,>> New underpants! >> I'll be happier
316,00:17:51.57,00:17:51.57,when I see what's in there. (grunting)
317,00:17:55.23,00:17:55.23,">> Hold on, dude. Hold on."
318,00:17:56.63,00:17:56.63,(Rupert grunts) There is a handle.
319,00:17:58.73,00:17:58.73,>> Where is the handle? >> What if you can
320,00:18:00.37,00:18:00.37,just open the top? Is it possible?
321,00:18:03.17,00:18:03.17,"So, after trying and trying and trying to bring the chest up,"
322,00:18:06.20,00:18:06.20,"they said, ""Okay, the hell with it, screw this."
323,00:18:08.20,00:18:08.20,"Let's pop the chest open."" When they cleared away the"
324,00:18:10.10,00:18:10.10,lock... >> Just be careful with our key.
325,00:18:12.40,00:18:12.40,>> Don't break it. >> ...and finally it popped
326,00:18:14.93,00:18:14.93,open. >> Oh!
327,00:18:18.23,00:18:18.23,">> And, oh, my God. A stench so awful."
328,00:18:21.73,00:18:21.73,Smelled like death. >> Someone open this.
329,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,Should we lay out a blanket and put everything...
330,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,"Oh, God. >> It smells horrible,"
331,00:18:29.33,00:18:29.33,horrible. >> They're moldy.
332,00:18:31.37,00:18:31.37,>> Everything's moldy and nasty. >> They're all molded.
333,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,">> Hey, it's better than nothing, you guys."
334,00:18:35.57,00:18:35.57,">> Oh, a bottle of something! >> Yeah."
335,00:18:37.73,00:18:37.73,>> Candy! >> Candy!
336,00:18:39.27,00:18:39.27,>> Get the candy out! Get the candy out.
337,00:18:41.60,00:18:41.60,>> I have to say the one thing that put a smile on everyone's
338,00:18:44.07,00:18:44.07,"face-- and thank God it was in there, was this thing of"
339,00:18:45.97,00:18:45.97,"chocolates. I mean, I don't..."
340,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,I think we would have ripped each other's heads off
341,00:18:50.07,00:18:50.07,"if those chocolates weren't in there, because that's how"
342,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,"disappointed we were. >> Rupert, take a break."
343,00:18:53.80,00:18:53.80,Everybody sit back and have chocolate.
344,00:18:55.57,00:18:55.57,">> Oh, my God. >> I'm in heaven."
345,00:18:59.90,00:18:59.90,">> Oh, my God! >> So, we open it up,"
346,00:19:03.10,00:19:03.10,"there were goblets, candleholders, candles."
347,00:19:05.70,00:19:05.70,"We got a lot of canned food. There's sugar, there's honey."
348,00:19:08.03,00:19:08.03,>> Sugar! >> Moldy beef jerky.
349,00:19:10.07,00:19:10.07,">> Some coffee beans, there were some chocolates,"
350,00:19:13.03,00:19:13.03,which made everyone feel a lot better.
351,00:19:14.97,00:19:14.97,"The treasure had leaked a little bit, some of the stuff was wet,"
352,00:19:18.40,00:19:18.40,"and I wanted to say, ""You guys grow up."
353,00:19:20.60,00:19:20.60,"You're being babies about it. ""We got something, and anything"
354,00:19:23.17,00:19:23.17,"is better than nothing."" >> The blankets smell like crap."
355,00:19:27.60,00:19:27.60,The hammock smells like crap. The mosquito net smells like
356,00:19:30.93,00:19:30.93,crap. I-I'd call it a ghetto
357,00:19:32.70,00:19:32.70,Christmas. It's like asking for an
358,00:19:34.50,00:19:34.50,Incredible Hulk doll and... and getting your sister's Ken doll
359,00:19:37.57,00:19:37.57,painted green. It's just not the same thing.
360,00:19:42.23,00:19:42.23,>> It's a quick shot to the other side here.
361,00:19:44.23,00:19:44.23,"I've been through here. It's a really thick, thick"
362,00:19:46.07,00:19:46.07,jungle. >> Then just walk along
363,00:19:47.63,00:19:47.63,the coastline... >> Ryno and I are going to have
364,00:19:49.80,00:19:49.80,a go at fishing today with the spear because we
365,00:19:52.07,00:19:52.07,lost all of our fish hooks. So we decided to go on the other
366,00:19:54.70,00:19:54.70,side of the island. The big map indicated some
367,00:19:56.73,00:19:56.73,"dorsal fins, indicating sharks or fish, so we thought,"
368,00:19:59.60,00:19:59.60,"since we haven't had any luck around here, although we've"
369,00:20:02.17,00:20:02.17,"seen some fish, that we thought the other side of the island"
370,00:20:04.87,00:20:04.87,may have a multitude of fish. We going the right way?
371,00:20:16.27,00:20:16.27,What do you think? >> I don't know.
372,00:20:17.93,00:20:17.93,That looks like an opening down there.
373,00:20:19.50,00:20:19.50,See where the light is? >> Let's have a look.
374,00:20:22.00,00:20:22.00,Cool. >> We're going to make it.
375,00:20:26.27,00:20:26.27,>> I can see the coast? >> Yep.
376,00:20:33.37,00:20:33.37,">> There is looting this morning for the Drake Tribe,"
377,00:20:35.53,00:20:35.53,and they'll be coming over to take another item
378,00:20:38.23,00:20:38.23,"from the Morgan Tribe. >> If they want to cripple us,"
379,00:20:45.30,00:20:45.30,"they'll take our pot. They take our pot,"
380,00:20:48.07,00:20:48.07,"Morgan, as we know it, is no longer, 'cause there's"
381,00:20:50.43,00:20:50.43,"no longer... we can't cook food, we can't boil water,"
382,00:20:52.83,00:20:52.83,"we'll be dehydrated, end of game."
383,00:20:56.20,00:20:56.20,>> I hate to do this. >> Whatever.
384,00:20:57.90,00:20:57.90,">> I'm Trish. >> Hi, Trish, I'm Tijuana."
385,00:20:59.67,00:20:59.67,"Nice to meet you. >> Hi, Tijuana."
386,00:21:01.70,00:21:01.70,>> Come on. >> I feel so bad.
387,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,">> Yeah, whatever. >> I really do."
388,00:21:05.50,00:21:05.50,>> How are you guys doing over there?
389,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,">> We're doing okay. Hi, you guys."
390,00:21:08.80,00:21:08.80,>> Hi. >> I'm Trish.
391,00:21:10.17,00:21:10.17,>> I'm Darrah. >> Nice to meet you.
392,00:21:12.30,00:21:12.30,How are you guys doing? You making out okay?
393,00:21:14.57,00:21:14.57,>> Yeah. Our boys went to go fishing.
394,00:21:16.13,00:21:16.13,">> Oh, they have? Wow, yeah."
395,00:21:27.33,00:21:27.33,>> What? Not any further down?
396,00:21:30.33,00:21:30.33,>> This is definitely The Blair Witch Project.
397,00:21:32.63,00:21:32.63,>> All right. It could be just
398,00:21:36.43,00:21:36.43,a little farther down. >> Do you realize how dangerous
399,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,it is to not have water? Yeah.
400,00:21:47.63,00:21:47.63,>> So what do you think you guys are looking for?
401,00:21:49.57,00:21:49.57,>> Um... This is the coolest shelter
402,00:21:52.17,00:21:52.17,you have. >> Thank you.
403,00:21:53.53,00:21:53.53,Our tough men put that together. >> It's nice.
404,00:21:55.83,00:21:55.83,">> Yeah. >> Um, I guess what they want"
405,00:21:58.63,00:21:58.63,is the lantern. >> You guys are gonna take our
406,00:22:01.60,00:22:01.60,lantern? >> I know. I hate it.
407,00:22:03.13,00:22:03.13,"I was trying to talk them into, like, not taking anything."
408,00:22:05.07,00:22:05.07,"I was, like, so shot down, man. I was, like, just no way."
409,00:22:10.00,00:22:10.00,">> We're relieved they didn't take our pot, 'cause that's our"
410,00:22:12.07,00:22:12.07,"only pot, and that's kind of what we were wanting them to"
411,00:22:14.43,00:22:14.43,take was the lantern. That's what we were wanting
412,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,them to take last time. We probably ruined it
413,00:22:18.00,00:22:18.00,"by putting cooking oil in it, so it's probably not going to"
414,00:22:20.60,00:22:20.60,work. >> Is that it?
415,00:22:33.53,00:22:33.53,Why is this side so choppy? I thought the other side was
416,00:22:37.07,00:22:37.07,supposed to be calmer. >> That's where I think we are.
417,00:22:40.20,00:22:40.20,">> Oh, yeah? >> Yeah."
418,00:22:41.70,00:22:41.70,>> This is not accurate though. >> Clearly this is not the big
419,00:22:45.57,00:22:45.57,"cove as indicated on the map. It seems to me we went due east,"
420,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,pretty much a straight line. We should have hit the cove dead
421,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93,"on and, uh... we didn't, so it's major league"
422,00:22:56.23,00:22:56.23,"frustrating for us. We need fish very, very badly."
423,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,"I mean, we don't have any energy."
424,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,We don't have any water. Phenomenally frustrating.
425,00:23:05.60,00:23:05.60,">> Both me and Savage are done. I mean, we're pretty much"
426,00:23:10.07,00:23:10.07,burned-out. I don't even know how long
427,00:23:12.07,00:23:12.07,"we've been out here, but, uh... I think the tribe's going"
428,00:23:14.33,00:23:14.33,"to be a little bit upset that we don't, uh..."
429,00:23:17.07,00:23:17.07,"have anything for them. >> So, last night, I woke up"
430,00:23:38.97,00:23:38.97,in the middle of the night. Couldn't sleep.
431,00:23:41.60,00:23:41.60,I saw that Rupert was up. I'd been meaning to talk to him.
432,00:23:43.87,00:23:43.87,I was a little hesitant because he's so gung-ho
433,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,on the whole Drake Tribe. I've been running every
434,00:23:50.63,00:23:50.63,single scenario through my head. >> Yeah?
435,00:23:53.53,00:23:53.53,>> Because you and I are screwed.
436,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,You and I are the two toughest of the 16.
437,00:23:58.30,00:23:58.30,">> Right. >> As soon as there's a merge,"
438,00:24:00.60,00:24:00.60,the strongest people are going to be the first people to go.
439,00:24:02.83,00:24:02.83,I know right now Rupert and myself are the biggest threats
440,00:24:04.80,00:24:04.80,"in our tribe. Between Jon, Trish and Sandra,"
441,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"if they do really start putting it together, hell, yeah, they"
442,00:24:09.90,00:24:09.90,should get rid of us now. We don't need to win any more
443,00:24:12.37,00:24:12.37,immunities. >> Right.
444,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,">> At some point, we should lose."
445,00:24:18.90,00:24:18.90,"We can do it, but we have to get rid of Christa, and we have"
446,00:24:22.40,00:24:22.40,"to get rid of Trish, and we have to do it soon."
447,00:24:25.90,00:24:25.90,Can you do that? If to keep us... to keep this
448,00:24:29.30,00:24:29.30,"tribe together, yeah. Heck, yeah, I can."
449,00:24:31.70,00:24:31.70,>> That's what I wanted to hear. >> When Burt comes to me and
450,00:24:34.87,00:24:34.87,"says, ""We're going to get rid of some of our Drakes..."""
451,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,"As soon as he said that, I wanted to smack him"
452,00:24:39.93,00:24:39.93,"and say, you know, ""Traitor."" If this was a pirate culture,"
453,00:24:42.67,00:24:42.67,"he'd already be dead. >> If we go to immunity,"
454,00:24:45.47,00:24:45.47,"and we don't win, and we get rid of Christa,"
455,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,"we're in a good position. But, God, we've got to get rid"
456,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90,of Christa. So this conversation is between
457,00:24:51.90,00:24:51.90,"you and me. >> Oh, most definitely."
458,00:24:53.37,00:24:53.37,">> And, as long as no one else knows, we can run the game."
459,00:24:57.03,00:24:57.03,">> Right. >> Knock, knock."
460,00:25:10.40,00:25:10.40,Who's there? Sea mail.
461,00:25:12.40,00:25:12.40,Sea mail who? Sea mail.
462,00:25:19.37,00:25:19.37,"""Familiar with the game of checkers?"
463,00:25:21.17,00:25:21.17,"""Familiar with the game of chess?"
464,00:25:23.77,00:25:23.77,"""Heard of professional wrestling?"
465,00:25:26.43,00:25:26.43,">> Uh-oh. >> ""Combined make a worthy"
466,00:25:28.47,00:25:28.47,"test."" >> ""Formulating strategies,"
467,00:25:31.53,00:25:31.53,"""take some time to think. To avoid the next"

469,00:25:38.23,00:25:38.23,">> In the water, homes. >> Full contact chess, man."
470,00:25:40.70,00:25:40.70,">> Someone has to be dunked? >> We are, as a group, thinking"
471,00:25:44.63,00:25:44.63,"about throwing the challenge. The alliance that I'm with,"
472,00:25:47.33,00:25:47.33,we're all ready to get Christa out right now.
473,00:25:50.00,00:25:50.00,"And, therefore, are willing to back off from the challenge,"
474,00:25:52.97,00:25:52.97,and not give it 100%. >> My alliance is interested
475,00:26:11.10,00:26:11.10,in throwing the challenge to cut out a little bit of
476,00:26:13.73,00:26:13.73,"cancer in our tribe: namely, Burton."
477,00:26:17.47,00:26:17.47,"In that, I can sit out on a challenge."
478,00:26:19.43,00:26:19.43,"I already told them that, if I'm in a challenge,"
479,00:26:21.50,00:26:21.50,there's no way in hell that I would lose.
480,00:26:23.63,00:26:23.63,Throwing a challenge is the stupidest thing
481,00:26:26.10,00:26:26.10,that Drake could ever do. But will I stand back
482,00:26:29.97,00:26:29.97,"and let them do it? Yes, if that's what they want"
483,00:26:33.00,00:26:33.00,"to do. >> PROBST: Welcome, Drake,"
484,00:26:44.03,00:26:44.03,Morgan. First things first.
485,00:26:45.63,00:26:45.63,"Burton, I need the immunity idol."
486,00:26:48.03,00:26:48.03,Get that up here. Immunity back up for grabs.
487,00:26:55.33,00:26:55.33,"Okay. For today's immunity challenge, once again we look"
488,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"to the world of pirates. Back in the day,"
489,00:27:01.43,00:27:01.43,"when they ruled the seas, it was only a matter of time"
490,00:27:04.27,00:27:04.27,before they wanted to board your ship.
491,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,And the only way to stop them from doing that was to engage
492,00:27:09.30,00:27:09.30,in battle. Each tribe member will move one
493,00:27:11.90,00:27:11.90,space at a time across the platform.
494,00:27:13.80,00:27:13.80,Your goal: get to the other side.
495,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,"If you are blocked by another tribe member,"
496,00:27:18.67,00:27:18.67,you will have to engage in a showdown.
497,00:27:20.57,00:27:20.57,"When two people decide to show down, it will be"
498,00:27:23.30,00:27:23.30,a battle of strength and balance.
499,00:27:25.53,00:27:25.53,"First person to hit the water is out, has to swim back to the"
500,00:27:29.70,00:27:29.70,"beginning, start again. The winner moves forward"
501,00:27:31.97,00:27:31.97,one space. The first tribe to get all their
502,00:27:34.60,00:27:34.60,tribe members to the other side wins immunity.
503,00:27:37.57,00:27:37.57,"And, along with immunity, a little something else we'll"
504,00:27:40.70,00:27:40.70,"save for after the challenge. All right, Drake, because you"
505,00:27:43.10,00:27:43.10,"have three extra members, you're sitting three people out."
506,00:27:45.03,00:27:45.03,You cannot sit the same people out in back-to-back challenges.
507,00:27:47.47,00:27:47.47,"Who's sitting out? Rupert, Trish, Burton,"
508,00:27:49.60,00:27:49.60,"you stay in the boat. Everybody else strategize,"
509,00:27:54.00,00:27:54.00,"wait for my ""go."" At stake: immunity, and a"
510,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70,surprise reward for after the challenge.
511,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,"Drake, you won the coin toss. Who's moving first?"
512,00:28:07.43,00:28:07.43,Sandra makes the first move. First move for Morgan.
513,00:28:12.27,00:28:12.27,Osten on the course. Shawn.
514,00:28:15.03,00:28:15.03,Ryno. Michelle moving out
515,00:28:16.90,00:28:16.90,onto the course. Andrew makes his first move.
516,00:28:19.90,00:28:19.90,"A lot of showdowns lining up. T on the course now,"
517,00:28:24.40,00:28:24.40,with a smile on her face and ready to take somebody on.
518,00:28:28.33,00:28:28.33,Jon saves himself for last. Darrah on the board.
519,00:28:32.30,00:28:32.30,We have all ten tribe members out.
520,00:28:34.80,00:28:34.80,Now it's going to get good. Morgan.
521,00:28:38.87,00:28:38.87,Osten challenges Michelle. Here's what's going to happen.
522,00:28:41.57,00:28:41.57,"I'm going to tell you to put one foot in the white,"
523,00:28:43.83,00:28:43.83,"and then, when you both have a foot, I'm going to say, ""Go."""
524,00:28:46.77,00:28:46.77,"Once I say, ""Go,"" it's on. First person in the water"
525,00:28:49.37,00:28:49.37,"is out, and goes back to the start."
526,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,Here we go. Foot in the white.
527,00:28:57.87,00:28:57.87,Go. (screams)
528,00:29:03.90,00:29:03.90,"Michelle in. Osten doesn't even get wet,"
529,00:29:06.07,00:29:06.07,moves forward. Michelle goes back to the start.
530,00:29:08.87,00:29:08.87,Got another showdown: Ryno and N.Y.C.
531,00:29:12.40,00:29:12.40,Go! Ryno in.
532,00:29:18.93,00:29:18.93,Shawn doesn't get wet. Shawn moves forward.
533,00:29:22.60,00:29:22.60,"Ryno back to the start. Morgan, got another showdown."
534,00:29:26.40,00:29:26.40,Osten challenges Jon. Go!
535,00:29:31.97,00:29:31.97,Jon takes a bath. Osten moves forward.
536,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,That is one for Morgan. Take a spot in the Morgan boat.
537,00:29:38.03,00:29:38.03,Andrew challenges Michelle. Go!
538,00:29:43.53,00:29:43.53,Oh. Close.
539,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,"Waged a good battle, but Michelle's first in the"
540,00:29:48.43,00:29:48.43,"water, she's out. Andrew moves into the last spot,"
541,00:29:51.20,00:29:51.20,"and, with that, it's two Morgan, nothing Drake."
542,00:29:54.07,00:29:54.07,We have another challenge: Shawn taking on T.
543,00:29:57.37,00:29:57.37,Go! Yeah!
544,00:30:03.00,00:30:03.00,T first in. Gave it an effort.
545,00:30:05.13,00:30:05.13,Very good. T back to the start.
546,00:30:07.70,00:30:07.70,"That's one for Drake. >> Good job, Shawn."
547,00:30:11.10,00:30:11.10,">> PROBST: So, I got to ask at this point:"
548,00:30:12.80,00:30:12.80,"Obviously, it's a strong physical battle and your two..."
549,00:30:16.37,00:30:16.37,two of your strongest guys chose to sit out.
550,00:30:18.77,00:30:18.77,Why come? >> Wasn't my choice.
551,00:30:21.57,00:30:21.57,>> PROBST: Wasn't your choice? You guys have a rotation
552,00:30:23.80,00:30:23.80,"that doesn't change. All right, that works."
553,00:30:27.03,00:30:27.03,Drake. Michelle challenges another
554,00:30:30.53,00:30:30.53,showdown. Ryno moves into the spot.
555,00:30:34.27,00:30:34.27,"That's three Morgan members, one Drake member."
556,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,Morgan giving T the chance to take Jon in.
557,00:30:42.77,00:30:42.77,Jon first in the water! Take a swim back.
558,00:30:49.40,00:30:49.40,Christa in the water. Back to the start.
559,00:30:52.37,00:30:52.37,"Darrah moves forward. Darrah, you move forward."
560,00:30:56.37,00:30:56.37,"Sandra takes her last move. And, with that,"
561,00:30:58.67,00:30:58.67,Sandra's in for Drake. T moves to her last spot.
562,00:31:01.87,00:31:01.87,Morgan has their fourth member across.
563,00:31:03.27,00:31:03.27,"Michelle is in, and off the course."
564,00:31:07.53,00:31:07.53,"Darrah, the only remaining member of Morgan, needs to get"
565,00:31:09.80,00:31:09.80,in. Here's where we're at.
566,00:31:11.90,00:31:11.90,"Morgan at four, Drake at three. First tribe to get"
567,00:31:14.27,00:31:14.27,all members in wins immunity. Drake... and a little something
568,00:31:16.40,00:31:16.40,else. Morgan... just a matter of
569,00:31:20.00,00:31:20.00,playing it out now. Drake.
570,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53,"Darrah, make the only move you can-- the last move."
571,00:31:28.27,00:31:28.27,"And, with that, Darrah moves in. Morgan wins their first"
572,00:31:31.07,00:31:31.07,challenge. Morgan wins immunity!
573,00:31:34.43,00:31:34.43,Morgan finally on the board. Congratulations.
574,00:31:42.43,00:31:42.43,"All right, Morgan, immunity for your tribe,"
575,00:31:45.67,00:31:45.67,and a little something else. I shall read the note.
576,00:31:49.70,00:31:49.70,"""Choose one tribe member from the opposing tribe"
577,00:31:52.30,00:31:52.30,"to come live with you until the next challenge."""
578,00:31:54.53,00:31:54.53,Here's what that means. You are going to choose
579,00:31:58.33,00:31:58.33,a tribe member from Drake right now.
580,00:31:59.93,00:31:59.93,They will leave with you right now.
581,00:32:01.60,00:32:01.60,They will not go to Tribal Council tomorrow night.
582,00:32:04.23,00:32:04.23,They cannot be voted out. They will participate with you
583,00:32:07.13,00:32:07.13,in the next reward challenge and share in that reward if you win.
584,00:32:11.40,00:32:11.40,"Who's it going to be, Savage? >> Rupert."
585,00:32:13.20,00:32:13.20,">> PROBST: Rupert, for the next short while you are now going"
586,00:32:15.97,00:32:15.97,"to be living with Morgan. Out of the boat, into the Morgan"

588,00:32:22.30,00:32:22.30,">> We love you, Rupert. >> It's all good, baby."
589,00:32:28.20,00:32:28.20,">> It's all good. >> We love you, Rupert."
590,00:32:30.07,00:32:30.07,">> Love you guys. >> Hey, it'll only be temporary."
591,00:32:33.37,00:32:33.37,>> PROBST: And a nice welcome from Ryno.
592,00:32:35.43,00:32:35.43,"I think Morgan likes you, Rupert."
593,00:32:39.57,00:32:39.57,"Here you are, Darrah. Morgan, congratulations."
594,00:32:45.97,00:32:45.97,Head back to camp. Drake... I will see you
595,00:32:48.93,00:32:48.93,at Tribal Council. We have a lot to talk about.
596,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,"Head out, guys. >> It was a little scary that"
597,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,Rupert went away with the other tribe.
598,00:33:21.80,00:33:21.80,"It was kind of a shocker. And, uh, I got a little nervous"
599,00:33:25.13,00:33:25.13,after this immunity challenge. I'm thinking that I could be
600,00:33:28.20,00:33:28.20,"the next to go. >> Come on, it's me and you, the"
601,00:33:31.90,00:33:31.90,macho man versus the little man. >> I'm thinking that maybe Jon
602,00:33:35.07,00:33:35.07,"may go with Michelle, Shawn and Burton, but I highly doubt it."
603,00:33:41.23,00:33:41.23,"So, I'm going to keep positive thinking and continue to think"
604,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"that he's with Trish, Sandra and I, even though Rupert's"
605,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,"gone. And, uh, hopefully it will be"
606,00:33:50.43,00:33:50.43,Burton to go instead of me. >> The way I see it... the way
607,00:33:58.27,00:33:58.27,"I see it, Jon, to be honest with you, there's four of us"
608,00:34:00.90,00:34:00.90,right here. I don't give a ... who they
609,00:34:03.30,00:34:03.30,vote for because there's no previous votes cast.
610,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,Sandra can go ... me. When... when we hear four votes
611,00:34:08.03,00:34:08.03,"for Christa, whatever the other three votes are for, you know"
612,00:34:11.27,00:34:11.27,that one of those votes were cast by those three people right
613,00:34:13.47,00:34:13.47,"there. And when they come back here,"
614,00:34:15.37,00:34:15.37,they're going to know they just sunk their own ship.
615,00:34:17.20,00:34:17.20,">> Jon claims he's fully onboard and, I've got to be honest, all"
616,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,the actions and all the things that Jon has said have been
617,00:34:23.27,00:34:23.27,very consistent over the past week about getting Christa
618,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,"off. >> You're a little nervous, but"
619,00:34:31.13,00:34:31.13,"once you've voted, uh, Christa gone, you know, show your"
620,00:34:34.10,00:34:34.10,"loyalty, we're all cool. We'll carry you to the end."
621,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,"That's... Burton's just worried right now, but he's going to be"
622,00:34:39.27,00:34:39.27,"going like, ""Oh, okay. I... I understand."""
623,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,>> There is a lot of scheming going on.
624,00:34:44.80,00:34:44.80,It's very funny. Some of the things that Jon
625,00:34:47.03,00:34:47.03,"comes back and tells, uh, Trish and Sandra and I."
626,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,>> Who do they think we're going to vote off-- Michelle?
627,00:34:52.53,00:34:52.53,"Tonight?! >> Yeah, yeah."
628,00:34:54.07,00:34:54.07,>> They think Michelle? >> Yeah.
629,00:34:56.47,00:34:56.47,>> I am somewhat afraid that Jon could be playing me.
630,00:35:00.60,00:35:00.60,>> Crack it open. >> It's just that he is talking
631,00:35:04.53,00:35:04.53,with Shawn and Burton and Michelle with such truth in his
632,00:35:07.90,00:35:07.90,"eyes, and I see it and observe it every day, and he does the"
633,00:35:10.60,00:35:10.60,"same thing to me, and it just makes me feel uneasy."
634,00:35:14.00,00:35:14.00,I just wish that he would talk to them a little bit less
635,00:35:15.90,00:35:15.90,convincingly. >> Do you want a little sugar
636,00:35:18.80,00:35:18.80,"in your drink? >> Don't drop it, dude."
637,00:35:21.67,00:35:21.67,">> Hey, you need to not drop it. (laughs)"
638,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,Whew! (laughs)
639,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63,>> I am so stoked to go to Tribal Council.
640,00:35:32.57,00:35:32.57,I am stoked! I want to see it.
641,00:35:34.87,00:35:34.87,I can't wait. I think it's going to be
642,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,awesome. Ric Flair is voted off the
643,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,island. Knowing that I'm going nowhere.
644,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,"Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get funky like a"
645,00:35:44.23,00:35:44.23,monkey. The game's going great for
646,00:35:45.97,00:35:45.97,Jonny Fairplay. I got a one-on-one alliance with
647,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,Shawn. I got a five-way alliance with
648,00:35:49.80,00:35:49.80,"myself, Trish, Rupert, Christa and Sandra."
649,00:35:55.47,00:35:55.47,"And I have a four-way alliance with myself, Shawn, Burton and"
650,00:35:57.53,00:35:57.53,"Michelle. He can do the strut, too!"
651,00:36:01.60,00:36:01.60,He can do the strut twice as fast!
652,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,I'm having a blast. It's even more fun than I
653,00:36:05.07,00:36:05.07,"imagined. I'm on paradise, and, uh,"
654,00:36:06.63,00:36:06.63,I'm a... I'm a freakin' puppet master.
655,00:36:09.17,00:36:09.17,That's all a guy can ask for. >> Turn around!
656,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,Turn around! >> Look at his white heinie.
657,00:36:15.37,00:36:15.37,"There's, like, this red back and then there's this pure white"
658,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,heinie. >> That's a sight to be had
659,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,right there. >> Darth Vader!
660,00:36:22.57,00:36:22.57,(laughter) >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
661,00:36:36.10,00:36:36.10,"a torch. I want you to grab a torch,"
662,00:36:38.30,00:36:38.30,"approach the flame, dip it and get fire."
663,00:36:40.63,00:36:40.63,We do this because fire represents your life in this
664,00:36:44.73,00:36:44.73,"game. As long as you have fire,"
665,00:36:47.77,00:36:47.77,"you're in the game. When your fire's gone, so are"
666,00:36:49.80,00:36:49.80,"you. Once you have fire, put it in a"
667,00:36:52.07,00:36:52.07,"slot and take a seat. For the first time, we have the"
668,00:36:59.53,00:36:59.53,"Drake Tribe at Tribal Council, minus Rupert, temporarily a"
669,00:37:02.80,00:37:02.80,"member of the Morgan Tribe. So, he can't be voted out"
670,00:37:06.47,00:37:06.47,"tonight. Jon, give me the state of"
671,00:37:08.80,00:37:08.80,"affairs for this tribe. >> Awesome, awesome, awesome,"
672,00:37:10.43,00:37:10.43,awesome. Happy tribe.
673,00:37:14.80,00:37:14.80,"That's it. Good tribe, couldn't be happier."
674,00:37:18.57,00:37:18.57,>> PROBST: Are you loaded? >> Yeah.
675,00:37:20.17,00:37:20.17,"(laughs) Like, you know, this isn't the"
676,00:37:23.80,00:37:23.80,"happiest of occasions, but you might as well make it as happy"
677,00:37:26.80,00:37:26.80,"as possible. >> PROBST: Michelle, any"
678,00:37:28.60,00:37:28.60,friendships developing 12 days in?
679,00:37:30.87,00:37:30.87,>> Tons of friendships. Everybody's a friend.
680,00:37:33.03,00:37:33.03,"We've, uh, been through some really strange, wild times"
681,00:37:35.80,00:37:35.80,"together, and everybody's kind of keeping an open mind about"
682,00:37:38.93,00:37:38.93,the situation. And we do come together more
683,00:37:41.50,00:37:41.50,"than... than I thought we did, so it's hard not to become"
684,00:37:43.70,00:37:43.70,friends with people. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
685,00:37:46.17,00:37:46.17,yesterday's challenge. I'm still a little confused.
686,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,"A very physical challenge, the first challenge we've had like"
687,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,"that, and you sit out Rupert and Burton, two of your strongest"
688,00:37:57.10,00:37:57.10,guys. And they tell me it's rotation
689,00:37:59.87,00:37:59.87,"with immunity at stake. Christa, is that true?"
690,00:38:02.53,00:38:02.53,">> Yeah, I think it's only fair. All of us want to have the"
691,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,"opportunity to participate. I mean, we only get the chance"
692,00:38:08.77,00:38:08.77,one in a lifetime to be out here.
693,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,">> PROBST: Is there a double-edged sword, Burton, to"
694,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,being a very successful tribe? The good news is you're not
695,00:38:18.27,00:38:18.27,losing anybody. The bad news is you can't get
696,00:38:21.77,00:38:21.77,rid of anybody. >> That's true.
697,00:38:23.90,00:38:23.90,"It is great to win everything because you avoid immunity,"
698,00:38:26.67,00:38:26.67,but at the same time you have absolutely no control over the
699,00:38:29.77,00:38:29.77,game itself. At some point that can come back
700,00:38:32.60,00:38:32.60,"to haunt you because if you wanted to send someone home,"
701,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,you wouldn't have the opportunity to.
702,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,">> PROBST: Jon, self-proclaimed ""good strategist,"" what are you"
703,00:38:40.30,00:38:40.30,"basing your vote on tonight? >> Um, by whatever the"
704,00:38:42.80,00:38:42.80,astrological signs tell me. >> PROBST: Is that a respectful
705,00:38:47.23,00:38:47.23,way to treat somebody that you've lived with for 12 days?
706,00:38:51.00,00:38:51.00,">> Maybe, maybe not. We'll find out in a few minutes."
707,00:38:55.87,00:38:55.87,">> PROBST: It is time to vote. Trish, you're up."
708,00:39:21.83,00:39:21.83,>> (whispers): You're the biggest threat that we have.
709,00:39:24.37,00:39:24.37,"We'll see you, buddy. >> Christa, this is a tough..."
710,00:39:38.00,00:39:38.00,"tough game, but I'm making strategic decisions."
711,00:39:57.67,00:39:57.67,">> Now, can you dig that, sucker?"
712,00:40:07.33,00:40:07.33,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
713,00:40:23.67,00:40:23.67,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
714,00:40:25.43,00:40:25.43,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
715,00:40:27.07,00:40:27.07,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
716,00:40:32.27,00:40:32.27,First vote... Christa.
717,00:40:41.40,00:40:41.40,"Burton. One vote Burton, one vote"
718,00:40:43.67,00:40:43.67,Christa. Christa.
719,00:40:50.67,00:40:50.67,That's two votes Christa. Burton.
720,00:40:56.47,00:40:56.47,"Two votes Burton, two votes Christa."
721,00:41:04.60,00:41:04.60,"Burton. That's three votes Burton,"
722,00:41:07.13,00:41:07.13,two votes Christa. First member of the Drake Tribe
723,00:41:13.53,00:41:13.53,voted out... Burton.
724,00:41:16.30,00:41:16.30,That's four votes. That's enough.
725,00:41:17.93,00:41:17.93,You need to bring me your torch. Last vote will remain a mystery.
726,00:41:26.97,00:41:26.97,"Burton, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
727,00:41:44.60,00:41:44.60,"Well, there was a lot of talk tonight about one big happy"
728,00:41:46.47,00:41:46.47,tribe. It should be interesting back at
729,00:41:48.70,00:41:48.70,camp. Grab your torches.
730,00:41:51.03,00:41:51.03,You can head back. Good night.
731,00:42:10.27,00:42:10.27,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

733,00:42:18.27,00:42:18.27,A voting betrayal is exposed. >> I know what Shawn wrote on

736,00:42:26.43,00:42:26.43,>> My concern with Rupert is that he's giving away too
737,00:42:28.60,00:42:28.60,much information about us and not realizing it.
738,00:42:30.67,00:42:30.67,>> PROBST: And things are looking up for Morgan.
739,00:42:33.03,00:42:33.03,>> Probably the smartest thing this tribe ever did was get a
740,00:42:35.30,00:42:35.30,"hold of Rupert. >> I'm, uh, disappointed beyond"
741,00:42:41.43,00:42:41.43,"what words could explain. But, being a strategic player"
742,00:42:46.23,00:42:46.23,"and knowing the threat that I posed in my tribe, I probably"
743,00:42:49.37,00:42:49.37,would've done what the majority ended up doing.
744,00:42:51.73,00:42:51.73,It's going to be a lot harder without me.
745,00:42:53.30,00:42:53.30,"Uh, challenges are not going to be guaranteed as they were when"
746,00:42:56.33,00:42:56.33,"I was involved. Good luck to those left, and"
747,00:42:58.23,00:42:58.23,I'll see you on the other side.
