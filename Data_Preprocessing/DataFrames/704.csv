88,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,"wake up and to do everything?That's a bunch of baloney,"
89,00:05:21.47,00:05:21.47,'cause they're rarelythe first ones up.
90,00:05:23.57,00:05:23.57,I woke up happyuntil I heard that crap.
91,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,">> I think because, uh, we'vewon so many challenges,"
92,00:05:30.60,00:05:30.60,it's starting to get annoying.Because we really want
93,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,"somebody to leave.Did you go to college, Shawn?"
94,00:05:37.10,00:05:37.10,>> What's that?>> Did you go to college?

97,00:05:42.60,00:05:42.60,Did you graduate?>> Mm-hmm.
98,00:05:44.37,00:05:44.37,>> There's definitely tension.Christa's always had her
99,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"little issues with me,and, you know, she's made"
100,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,"her little comments,things that just get on my nerve"
101,00:05:50.80,00:05:50.80,and I've just smiled rightthrough them and not said
102,00:05:53.07,00:05:53.07,"anything back.But, at the same time,"
103,00:05:54.90,00:05:54.90,I take note of everything.What you say is going
104,00:05:57.10,00:05:57.10,"to come back to get you,and in this case,"
105,00:05:59.30,00:05:59.30,"it's coming back to get her.>> These guys that are here,"
106,00:06:02.10,00:06:02.10,"especially Shawn and Michelleand Burton, I just don't"
107,00:06:05.80,00:06:05.80,get along with them.I don't feel the connection
108,00:06:07.60,00:06:07.60,with them.I don't feel like I can
109,00:06:09.90,00:06:09.90,speak my mind like I normallycan.
110,00:06:13.20,00:06:13.20,And I'd rather have themout of here.
111,00:06:14.87,00:06:14.87,">> Dude, just, whatever you do,say no to crack."
112,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"(laughs)Nothing, dude."
113,00:06:22.53,00:06:22.53,>> I'll kill you.>> Some plumbers wear skirts.
114,00:06:24.67,00:06:24.67,>> I'll kill you!>> Some plumbers wear skirts.

116,00:06:28.77,00:06:28.77,"a damn chicken!You know, I don't know,"
117,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,I turned around and Burton'spointing at my ass
118,00:06:34.50,00:06:34.50,and laughing at meand just being an idiot.
119,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,"You know, it's like highschool."
120,00:06:38.27,00:06:38.27,The... the pretty boyjock-ass idiots all got
121,00:06:40.87,00:06:40.87,to pick on me.>> Rupe.

123,00:06:46.70,00:06:46.70,one in a skirt around here.>> The whole time we've been
124,00:06:50.27,00:06:50.27,"here, Shawn and Burton andMichelle kind of cliqued up"
125,00:06:53.63,00:06:53.63,"right away, and, you know, Idon't know why they did that."
126,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27,I can only assumethat the two guys thought
127,00:06:57.83,00:06:57.83,"they were just so strong,that there's no way they were"
128,00:07:00.27,00:07:00.27,"going to get voted off.And, of course, Michelle's"
129,00:07:01.90,00:07:01.90,"adorable, and so they cliquedright into her."
130,00:07:03.63,00:07:03.63,But I don't think they realizethat they alienated everybody

386,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,">> Yeah, whatever.>> I really do."
387,00:21:05.50,00:21:05.50,>> How are you guys doing overthere?
388,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,">> We're doing okay.Hi, you guys."
389,00:21:08.80,00:21:08.80,>> Hi.>> I'm Trish.
390,00:21:10.17,00:21:10.17,>> I'm Darrah.>> Nice to meet you.
391,00:21:12.30,00:21:12.30,How are you guys doing?You making out okay?
392,00:21:14.57,00:21:14.57,>> Yeah. Our boys went to gofishing.
393,00:21:16.13,00:21:16.13,">> Oh, they have?Wow, yeah."
394,00:21:27.33,00:21:27.33,>> What?Not any further down?
395,00:21:30.33,00:21:30.33,>> This is definitelyThe Blair Witch Project.
396,00:21:32.63,00:21:32.63,>> All right.It could be just
397,00:21:36.43,00:21:36.43,a little farther down.>> Do you realize how dangerous
398,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,it is to not have water?Yeah.
399,00:21:47.63,00:21:47.63,>> So what do you think youguys are looking for?
400,00:21:49.57,00:21:49.57,>> Um...This is the coolest shelter
401,00:21:52.17,00:21:52.17,you have.>> Thank you.
402,00:21:53.53,00:21:53.53,Our tough men put that together.>> It's nice.
403,00:21:55.83,00:21:55.83,">> Yeah.>> Um, I guess what they want"
404,00:21:58.63,00:21:58.63,is the lantern.>> You guys are gonna take our
405,00:22:01.60,00:22:01.60,lantern?>> I know. I hate it.
406,00:22:03.13,00:22:03.13,"I was trying to talk them into,like, not taking anything."
407,00:22:05.07,00:22:05.07,"I was, like, so shot down, man.I was, like, just no way."
408,00:22:10.00,00:22:10.00,">> We're relieved they didn'ttake our pot, 'cause that's our"
409,00:22:12.07,00:22:12.07,"only pot, and that's kind ofwhat we were wanting them to"
410,00:22:14.43,00:22:14.43,take was the lantern.That's what we were wanting
411,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,them to take last time.We probably ruined it
412,00:22:18.00,00:22:18.00,"by putting cooking oil in it,so it's probably not going to"
413,00:22:20.60,00:22:20.60,work.>> Is that it?
414,00:22:33.53,00:22:33.53,Why is this side so choppy?I thought the other side was
415,00:22:37.07,00:22:37.07,supposed to be calmer.>> That's where I think we are.
416,00:22:40.20,00:22:40.20,">> Oh, yeah?>> Yeah."
417,00:22:41.70,00:22:41.70,>> This is not accurate though.>> Clearly this is not the big
418,00:22:45.57,00:22:45.57,"cove as indicated on the map.It seems to me we went due east,"
419,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,pretty much a straight line.We should have hit the cove dead
420,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93,"on and, uh...we didn't, so it's major league"
421,00:22:56.23,00:22:56.23,"frustrating for us.We need fish very, very badly."
422,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,"I mean, we don't have anyenergy."
423,00:23:03.07,00:23:03.07,We don't have any water.Phenomenally frustrating.
424,00:23:05.60,00:23:05.60,">> Both me and Savage are done.I mean, we're pretty much"
425,00:23:10.07,00:23:10.07,burned-out.I don't even know how long
426,00:23:12.07,00:23:12.07,"we've been out here, but, uh...I think the tribe's going"
427,00:23:14.33,00:23:14.33,"to be a little bit upsetthat we don't, uh..."
428,00:23:17.07,00:23:17.07,"have anything for them.>> So, last night, I woke up"
429,00:23:38.97,00:23:38.97,in the middle of the night.Couldn't sleep.
430,00:23:41.60,00:23:41.60,I saw that Rupert was up.I'd been meaning to talk to him.
431,00:23:43.87,00:23:43.87,I was a little hesitantbecause he's so gung-ho
432,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,on the whole Drake Tribe.I've been running every
433,00:23:50.63,00:23:50.63,single scenario through my head.>> Yeah?
434,00:23:53.53,00:23:53.53,>> Because you and I arescrewed.
435,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,You and I are the two toughestof the 16.
436,00:23:58.30,00:23:58.30,">> Right.>> As soon as there's a merge,"
437,00:24:00.60,00:24:00.60,the strongest people are goingto be the first people to go.
438,00:24:02.83,00:24:02.83,I know right now Rupert andmyself are the biggest threats
439,00:24:04.80,00:24:04.80,"in our tribe.Between Jon, Trish and Sandra,"
440,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"if they do really start puttingit together, hell, yeah, they"
441,00:24:09.90,00:24:09.90,should get rid of us now.We don't need to win any more
442,00:24:12.37,00:24:12.37,immunities.>> Right.
443,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,">> At some point, we shouldlose."
444,00:24:18.90,00:24:18.90,"We can do it, but we have to getrid of Christa, and we have"
445,00:24:22.40,00:24:22.40,"to get rid of Trish, and we haveto do it soon."
446,00:24:25.90,00:24:25.90,Can you do that?If to keep us... to keep this
447,00:24:29.30,00:24:29.30,"tribe together, yeah.Heck, yeah, I can."
448,00:24:31.70,00:24:31.70,>> That's what I wanted to hear.>> When Burt comes to me and
449,00:24:34.87,00:24:34.87,"says, ""We're going to get rid ofsome of our Drakes..."""
450,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,"As soon as he said that,I wanted to smack him"
451,00:24:39.93,00:24:39.93,"and say, you know, ""Traitor.""If this was a pirate culture,"
452,00:24:42.67,00:24:42.67,"he'd already be dead.>> If we go to immunity,"
453,00:24:45.47,00:24:45.47,"and we don't win,and we get rid of Christa,"
454,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,"we're in a good position.But, God, we've got to get rid"
455,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90,of Christa.So this conversation is between
456,00:24:51.90,00:24:51.90,"you and me.>> Oh, most definitely."
457,00:24:53.37,00:24:53.37,">> And, as long as no one elseknows, we can run the game."
458,00:24:57.03,00:24:57.03,">> Right.>> Knock, knock."

485,00:26:48.03,00:26:48.03,Get that up here.Immunity back up for grabs.
486,00:26:55.33,00:26:55.33,"Okay. For today's immunitychallenge, once again we look"
487,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"to the world of pirates.Back in the day,"
488,00:27:01.43,00:27:01.43,"when they ruled the seas,it was only a matter of time"
489,00:27:04.27,00:27:04.27,before they wantedto board your ship.
490,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,And the only way to stop themfrom doing that was to engage
491,00:27:09.30,00:27:09.30,in battle.Each tribe member will move one
492,00:27:11.90,00:27:11.90,space at a time acrossthe platform.
493,00:27:13.80,00:27:13.80,Your goal: get to the otherside.

502,00:27:37.57,00:27:37.57,"And, along with immunity,a little something else we'll"
503,00:27:40.70,00:27:40.70,"save for after the challenge.All right, Drake, because you"
504,00:27:43.10,00:27:43.10,"have three extra members,you're sitting three people out."
505,00:27:45.03,00:27:45.03,You cannot sit the same peopleout in back-to-back challenges.
506,00:27:47.47,00:27:47.47,"Who's sitting out?Rupert, Trish, Burton,"

511,00:28:07.43,00:28:07.43,Sandra makes the first move.First move for Morgan.
