2,00:00:06.13,00:00:06.13," of Survivor: Thailand,"
3,00:00:07.40,00:00:07.40," we'll take a look back at the first 30 days,"
4,00:00:10.03,00:00:10.03, through highlights and never-before-seen footage.
5,00:00:14.40,00:00:14.40,"JAKE: You know, the canoe weighs 2,321 pounds, I'm convinced."
6,00:00:19.30,00:00:19.30, That was the worst canoe I've ever been in
7,00:00:20.97,00:00:20.97, in my entire life.
8,00:00:23.07,00:00:23.07,How many of you votefor burning the ... canoe?!
9,00:00:26.70,00:00:26.70,-Ooh.-JAN: Clay.
10,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,"He's an ass man, apparently."
11,00:00:29.93,00:00:29.93,(Clay whoops)
12,00:00:32.43,00:00:32.43,It's just partof Clay's personality.
13,00:00:34.70,00:00:34.70,"CLAY: Erin's a neat girl, and"
14,00:00:37.07,00:00:37.07,isn't she a bubba-loo.
15,00:00:39.47,00:00:39.47,Damn. Mmm.
16,00:00:41.57,00:00:41.57,(humming)
17,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,"GHANDIA: I like the whole model scene,"
18,00:00:45.17,00:00:45.17,"you know, 'cause I'm fine,I realize that."
19,00:00:47.30,00:00:47.30,Do the camera. Do the camera.(imitates clicking)
20,00:00:49.63,00:00:49.63,TED: We call Ghandia the Diva Queen.
21,00:00:52.33,00:00:52.33,Then I'll whip out the camera
22,00:00:53.50,00:00:53.50,"and say, ""Oh, work it,work it, girl."""
23,00:00:54.67,00:00:54.67,"""Who she think she is,calling her diva?"""
24,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,"Uh, hello!"
25,00:00:58.43,00:00:58.43,"I'm a diva, and you're not."
26,00:02:08.20,00:02:08.20," PROBST:  On day one,"
27,00:02:09.50,00:02:09.50, the survivors left a small fishing village
28,00:02:12.23,00:02:12.23, as a group of men and a group of women.
29,00:02:15.33,00:02:15.33,"Right from the start, they knewthere would be some surprises."
30,00:02:19.07,00:02:19.07,JOHN: We came in and walked through this ancient Thai
31,00:02:21.97,00:02:21.97,"fishing village,got on our boats--"
32,00:02:23.93,00:02:23.93," men in one, women in the other-- which of course,"
33,00:02:25.93,00:02:25.93, led us to believe that the tribes were going to be
34,00:02:28.03,00:02:28.03, the men against the women.
35,00:02:29.23,00:02:29.23,PROBST:  But they soon learned
36,00:02:31.00,00:02:31.00, that wasn't the case.
37,00:02:32.37,00:02:32.37,"You're going to chooseyour own tribes, right now."
38,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17, In keeping with the Thai tradition
39,00:02:36.77,00:02:36.77," of honoring the elders, Jake and Jan, the two oldest,"
40,00:02:39.70,00:02:39.70, were allowed to pick their own tribes.
41,00:02:42.47,00:02:42.47,"When Jeff said thatwe were picking the tribes,"
42,00:02:44.77,00:02:44.77," I was scared, because, um, I'm not really a leader."
43,00:02:48.57,00:02:48.57,"JAKE: I like to see athletic-looking people, so,"
44,00:02:51.90,00:02:51.90, I based picking the team on
45,00:02:53.40,00:02:53.40, just that gleam in their eye that looks
46,00:02:55.30,00:02:55.30, like they'd be there for the duration.
47,00:02:57.10,00:02:57.10,"PROBST: Jan chose an older group for Chuay Gahn,"
48,00:03:00.73,00:03:00.73, while Jake went with youth and brawn for Sook Jai.
49,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,"JAKE: You know, I've got a crew"
50,00:03:06.67,00:03:06.67, that's totally enthusiastic and ready to go.
51,00:03:09.00,00:03:09.00,"You can totallyswing on this, guys."
52,00:03:11.73,00:03:11.73,JAKE:  But they know
53,00:03:13.00,00:03:13.00,nothing.
54,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10,"PROBST: At Chuay Gahn, the tribe was quick"
55,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77," to make use of the natural cave,"
56,00:03:22.63,00:03:22.63, while John was quick to delegate chores.
57,00:03:25.67,00:03:25.67,"-This'll be...-You see? That's not dry, and..."
58,00:03:27.50,00:03:27.50,You don't think it's dry enough?
59,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,"-No, sir. We got plenty of that.-All right."
60,00:03:30.90,00:03:30.90,"CLAY: John's over trying to start a fire, and he wants"
61,00:03:33.67,00:03:33.67,to sit there and not go outand hunt for the dry stuff.
62,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83,He keeps telling everybody
63,00:03:37.00,00:03:37.00," to go hunt the dry stuff, but he wants to sit there and try"
64,00:03:39.37,00:03:39.37, to strike leaves. He needs to get up and go try to find
65,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57, some dry stuff.
66,00:03:42.57,00:03:42.57," Everybody is hunting for that,"
67,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,"except him,and he's sitting there"
68,00:03:45.17,00:03:45.17,"saying, ""You can't strike it,you can't strike it."""
69,00:03:46.40,00:03:46.40,JAN:We got fire!
70,00:03:47.57,00:03:47.57,HELEN:Don't-Don't count your chickens.
71,00:03:48.80,00:03:48.80,-Getting the fire is easy.-TED: Oh.
72,00:03:50.37,00:03:50.37,"-Getting the dry stuff to, uh,burn is-- -Gettin' it to ignite."
73,00:03:52.43,00:03:52.43,CLAY: John-- he's already pissed everybody off.
74,00:03:55.00,00:03:55.00,"Everything you do: ""Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no."""
75,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43, We had all the stuff to start a fire.
76,00:03:59.83,00:03:59.83," Well, he decided that wasn't good, so he thought..."
77,00:04:01.63,00:04:01.63," And he wants to sit there, and everybody go find him fire."
78,00:04:04.07,00:04:04.07,"What would happen if we justchop up what we have, or...?"
79,00:04:06.63,00:04:06.63,"That would work, exceptit just doesn't ignite quickly."
80,00:04:09.13,00:04:09.13,"Okay, I got a real good idea."
81,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00,"We're-We're gathering bamboo,"
82,00:04:12.27,00:04:12.27,we're gathering coconutsand all this.
83,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67,"If we don't have this,ought to go find some."
84,00:04:15.80,00:04:15.80,Then come right backand do it.
85,00:04:17.50,00:04:17.50,"Okay, you want us to go gatherthe straw to-to make your fire,"
86,00:04:21.07,00:04:21.07,"do all this, and you're goingto sit here and look at this."
87,00:04:24.37,00:04:24.37,Why don't you come help us?
88,00:04:26.00,00:04:26.00,This won't work?This right here won't work?
89,00:04:27.93,00:04:27.93,JAN:Clay?
90,00:04:29.23,00:04:29.23,I'll start that damn...
91,00:04:31.17,00:04:31.17,-Oh! Oh!-There you go.
92,00:04:32.37,00:04:32.37,"-There, that...-Oh!"
93,00:04:34.97,00:04:34.97,"CLAY: John? No, me and John don't think alike a lot."
94,00:04:38.07,00:04:38.07,"As far as compassion to family, we think a lot alike,"
95,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20," but wilderness, outdoor surviving, we don't think"
96,00:04:44.30,00:04:44.30, alike at... at all.
97,00:04:52.90,00:04:52.90,Let's go to the beach.
98,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,"PROBST:  When night fell,"
99,00:04:55.40,00:04:55.40, the mood at Sook Jai was upbeat.
100,00:04:57.10,00:04:57.10,ROBB: We were so excited about
101,00:04:58.93,00:04:58.93,"the team that we ended up with,"
102,00:05:00.23,00:05:00.23, we all decided to come down
103,00:05:01.33,00:05:01.33, to the beach and just check it out.
104,00:05:02.53,00:05:02.53,(laughing)
105,00:05:04.23,00:05:04.23,Stephanie even got naked.
106,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,"Oh, my God, are you naked?"
107,00:05:06.17,00:05:06.17,Fixin' to be.
108,00:05:07.43,00:05:07.43,"Oh, my God, she is wild,she is crazy."
109,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,You look good in the moonlight.
110,00:05:11.87,00:05:11.87,"-It suits you.-Well, thank you."
111,00:05:16.80,00:05:16.80,"PROBST: But on day two, SookJai's happy mood began to sour,"
112,00:05:20.87,00:05:20.87, when the tribe clashed over priorities.
113,00:05:23.33,00:05:23.33,ROBB: So many people are going in so many directions
114,00:05:25.33,00:05:25.33,"and doing stuff, and it's...they're not producing anything."
115,00:05:27.17,00:05:27.17,-Let me see your hands!-I understand your hands.
116,00:05:28.77,00:05:28.77,"-Let me see your hands! -Dude,I was told to go get food, okay?"
117,00:05:30.60,00:05:30.60,"Okay, I'm not saying that,sweetie. Let me see your hands."
118,00:05:32.67,00:05:32.67,"-That's my point, dude.-Listen."
119,00:05:34.30,00:05:34.30,I'm not hereto be yelled at by you.
120,00:05:35.63,00:05:35.63,"Pick up something, dude.I'm not yelling at you, sweetie!"
121,00:05:36.87,00:05:36.87,"I'm saying, I want to sleeptonight, okay?"
122,00:05:38.07,00:05:38.07,"How'd you sleep last night?Pretty good, huh?"
123,00:05:39.70,00:05:39.70,"My point, exactly. Walk away."
124,00:05:41.60,00:05:41.60,SHII ANN: You do not mess with
125,00:05:43.00,00:05:43.00,"the Shii-Devil and not getthe horns, okay?"
126,00:05:45.70,00:05:45.70,PROBST: Chuay Gahn was having  their own problems.
127,00:05:49.30,00:05:49.30, Tanya was feeling sick.
128,00:05:52.43,00:05:52.43, And the tribe got lost looking for their water hole.
129,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,HELEN: There's no way that ifthis is the water source that
130,00:05:57.57,00:05:57.57,we're supposed to be able tocome up here every couple days
131,00:05:59.43,00:05:59.43,"with a big, huge gallon jug"
132,00:06:00.87,00:06:00.87,and fill it upand go back down again.
133,00:06:03.07,00:06:03.07,So I-I don't thinkwe're on the right track.
134,00:06:07.90,00:06:07.90,"Here we go, guys.Immunity at stake."
135,00:06:09.80,00:06:09.80,Survivors ready?
136,00:06:11.23,00:06:11.23,Go!
137,00:06:12.50,00:06:12.50," PROBST: At the first immunity challenge,"
138,00:06:13.77,00:06:13.77, Chuay Gahn showed that they weren't
139,00:06:15.63,00:06:15.63, a bunch of old fogies by taking an early lead.
140,00:06:18.50,00:06:18.50,"-Row! Row! -Dig in, right side.Dig in, right side."
141,00:06:21.10,00:06:21.10,Paddle!
142,00:06:22.50,00:06:22.50,PROBST:But it was too good to be true.
143,00:06:24.00,00:06:24.00, Sook Jai overtook Chuay Gahn
144,00:06:26.77,00:06:26.77, when Ghandia struggled with the sliding puzzle.
145,00:06:28.87,00:06:28.87,(cheering)
146,00:06:31.23,00:06:31.23,"-Come on, guys.-Hurry up! Hurry up!"
147,00:06:32.43,00:06:32.43,-Got this mother!-Get the flag!
148,00:06:35.40,00:06:35.40,PROBST:Sook Jai wins immunity!
149,00:06:40.73,00:06:40.73," Chuay Gahn made the hike to the first Tribal Council,"
150,00:06:43.77,00:06:43.77," but that didn't worry Pastor John, who was feeling secure."
151,00:06:48.33,00:06:48.33,I'll read the votes.
152,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,JOHN: I felt pretty confident Ghandia was going that night.
153,00:06:52.33,00:06:52.33,First vote-- Ghandia.
154,00:06:54.03,00:06:54.03,JOHN: Jeff opened the urn. First vote-- Ghandia.
155,00:06:58.07,00:06:58.07, -Second vote... -Clay.
156,00:07:00.07,00:07:00.07," And he picked up that card and he turned it around,"
157,00:07:02.13,00:07:02.13, and I saw J-O-H-N.
158,00:07:03.53,00:07:03.53,John.
159,00:07:04.97,00:07:04.97," It's like, all of a sudden, you get, like,"
160,00:07:07.63,00:07:07.63,this bump in the pitof your heart-- boom.
161,00:07:10.07,00:07:10.07,"You know, your name resonatesin a way it never has before."
162,00:07:14.77,00:07:14.77, Then when he turned the other one over
163,00:07:16.33,00:07:16.33," and said ""John"" again..."
164,00:07:17.67,00:07:17.67,Two votes-- John.
165,00:07:18.67,00:07:18.67," ...I'm like, ""Okay,"
166,00:07:19.80,00:07:19.80,"this is headingin a bad direction."""
167,00:07:21.57,00:07:21.57,By the time he turned
168,00:07:22.90,00:07:22.90," the third one over, I realized"
169,00:07:24.50,00:07:24.50, there was an alliance that I was left out of.
170,00:07:29.10,00:07:29.10,"That's four votes, John,and that's enough."
171,00:07:31.00,00:07:31.00,You need to bring me your torch.
172,00:07:32.53,00:07:32.53," You almost want to jump up and scream, ""Stop the music!"
173,00:07:34.87,00:07:34.87,"""That's enough humiliation."
174,00:07:36.53,00:07:36.53,"This hurts too bad."""
175,00:07:37.90,00:07:37.90,"John, the tribe has spoken."
176,00:07:42.27,00:07:42.27," I mean, I came in expecting to win this thing,"
177,00:07:44.80,00:07:44.80, and I am going to go down in history
178,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,as the first onevoted off of Survivor V.

180,00:07:58.07,00:07:58.07, Ted was settling into a routine.

182,00:08:03.37,00:08:03.37,a shaving kit.
183,00:08:11.67,00:08:11.67," I usually shave my head every three days, and in this world,"
184,00:08:15.13,00:08:15.13," every three days is the Tribal Council, so..."
185,00:08:18.80,00:08:18.80,"I figure to starta new, renewed spirit after"
186,00:08:21.80,00:08:21.80," each Tribal Council, I'm going to shave my head."
187,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,"Oh, thank you, baby!"
188,00:08:26.13,00:08:26.13,-Oh...!-Looking good!

191,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,He's probably got--I'm sure he's got
192,00:08:32.57,00:08:32.57,facials and manicuresas well as pedicures.
193,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,Whatever.
194,00:08:36.50,00:08:36.50," It just gives me a new, fresh,"
195,00:08:38.20,00:08:38.20,"a new outlook,a new start over, if you will."
196,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83," I'm starting that tradition today, and it's good."
197,00:08:44.13,00:08:44.13,"You guys just don't knowhow good this feels, bro."

802,00:31:33.00,00:31:33.00,you got the prettiest assaround here
803,00:31:34.63,00:31:34.63,glowing in that fire.
804,00:31:35.97,00:31:35.97,(laughter)
805,00:31:37.67,00:31:37.67,"Ooh, Clay, I'm sorry my buttis right in your face."
806,00:31:39.77,00:31:39.77,It's fine.I just wanted you to know
807,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,that the sun was kind ofglancing off that baby.
808,00:31:47.73,00:31:47.73,Hey! Hey!
809,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,(chuckles)
810,00:31:52.90,00:31:52.90,Treemail!
811,00:31:54.00,00:31:54.00,That's one crazy son of a bitch.
812,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,"Flippers, fins, snorkels!"
813,00:31:57.50,00:31:57.50,"PROBST: On day 23, the tribes received a special treemail."
814,00:32:01.93,00:32:01.93,"""This is not a challenge,so everybody wins."
815,00:32:04.93,00:32:04.93,"""Just go have some fun withnew masks, snorkel and fins."""
816,00:32:09.30,00:32:09.30,Ah!
817,00:32:10.63,00:32:10.63,"JAN:Go, guys."
818,00:32:11.83,00:32:11.83,Y'all going to get ussome fish tonight?
819,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,"CLAY: Wow. Y'all, let's getsome fish now."
820,00:32:15.77,00:32:15.77,-I'm ready.-Stick 'em.
821,00:32:17.27,00:32:17.27,PENNY: I'm real excited about the snorkeling.
822,00:32:19.73,00:32:19.73," I think the guys are more tickled about it,"
823,00:32:21.60,00:32:21.60,"really, than we are 'cause"
824,00:32:22.63,00:32:22.63,-we can sit back and talkrecipes -HELEN: Yeah.
825,00:32:24.37,00:32:24.37, -while they try to go get us some food. -That's right.
826,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,HELEN: Jake and Brian have this
827,00:32:32.00,00:32:32.00,Lord of the Flies dream right now
828,00:32:34.20,00:32:34.20," that they're going to go out there and stab a fish,"
829,00:32:36.97,00:32:36.97,but that's a verydifficult thing to do.
830,00:32:39.43,00:32:39.43,BRIAN: Fishing was extremely tough.
831,00:32:40.77,00:32:40.77, We don't have the right equipment to spear.
832,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,Only thing we've gotis the right snorkel and fins.
833,00:32:44.27,00:32:44.27, It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
834,00:32:51.73,00:32:51.73,"PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Brian and Jake"
835,00:32:54.10,00:32:54.10, put their snorkeling skills to the test.
836,00:32:56.23,00:32:56.23,Only two people leftin the water:
837,00:32:58.07,00:32:58.07,"Brian for Chuay Gahn,Jake for Sook Jai."
838,00:33:00.93,00:33:00.93,The only way Sook Jai can winis if Jake
839,00:33:03.97,00:33:03.97,stays under the waterlonger than Brian.
840,00:33:06.17,00:33:06.17,But Jake faltered before Brian.
841,00:33:08.37,00:33:08.37,Jake is up.
842,00:33:09.40,00:33:09.40,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
843,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17, Sook Jai would be heading to their fourth
844,00:33:15.10,00:33:15.10, Tribal Council in a row.
845,00:33:16.90,00:33:16.90,Do we want to go aheadand reveal who's going tonight?
846,00:33:20.63,00:33:20.63,I would only want to knowif everybody's in agreement
847,00:33:23.07,00:33:23.07,that that's whatwe're going to do.
848,00:33:24.63,00:33:24.63,It's got to be unanimous.
849,00:33:26.07,00:33:26.07,"-PENNY: Let's just save it forTribal Council, then. -Yeah."
850,00:33:28.80,00:33:28.80,"KEN: I kind of laughed to myself, this is a game"
851,00:33:31.13,00:33:31.13,and I'm fighting back tears?
852,00:33:33.13,00:33:33.13, I used to compare this to Monopoly.
853,00:33:34.93,00:33:34.93, This is nothing like Monopoly.
854,00:33:36.03,00:33:36.03,"PROBST: After 24 days together,"
855,00:33:39.30,00:33:39.30, Sook Jai reluctantly let Erin go.
856,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,First member of our jury-- Erin.
857,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,ERIN: The biggest lesson that I learned is that
858,00:33:47.80,00:33:47.80," going into the game, the Sook Jai tribe"
859,00:33:49.93,00:33:49.93,got really big headsfrom the very beginning.
860,00:33:52.93,00:33:52.93,We thought that our tribe was
861,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50," stronger, thinking, ""Oh, you know,"
862,00:33:56.87,00:33:56.87," ""we're going to win all these challenges."
863,00:33:58.53,00:33:58.53,"Erin, the tribe has spoken."
864,00:34:01.40,00:34:01.40,ERIN: Sook Jai thought that they were--
865,00:34:02.90,00:34:02.90," we were a very strong tribe, and once we actually went"
866,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17," to live with the Chuay Gahn members, we realized that"
867,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07, they were a much closer tribe than... than we were.
868,00:34:11.27,00:34:11.27, So I think my biggest lesson was
869,00:34:13.47,00:34:13.47, don't take anything for granted.
870,00:34:14.93,00:34:14.93," You know, first impressions aren't always true."
871,00:34:33.13,00:34:33.13,"Sleep tight, everyone."
872,00:34:58.13,00:34:58.13,Oh!
873,00:34:59.97,00:34:59.97,(mutters)
874,00:35:05.60,00:35:05.60,JAKE: Brian was sleeping kind of
875,00:35:06.73,00:35:06.73," next to me, and all of a sudden,"
876,00:35:07.93,00:35:07.93,I heard this racket.
877,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,Came right upand hit me on the head.
878,00:35:11.67,00:35:11.67, And it took offand then I could hear it again.
879,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,(making buzzing noises)
880,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00," Sounded like it had, like, ten wings or something."
881,00:35:18.30,00:35:18.30,It's not a bat?
882,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93," And then a few minutes later, I heard the..."
883,00:35:22.77,00:35:22.77,(making buzzing noises)
884,00:35:24.53,00:35:24.53,Here it came back.
885,00:35:25.67,00:35:25.67,It's back. (muttering)
886,00:35:29.47,00:35:29.47,CLAY: Jake and Brian got attacked by a bug.
887,00:35:32.07,00:35:32.07," It was pretty funny. I never saw it or heard it,"
888,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,"but I'm going to tell you what,"
889,00:35:35.67,00:35:35.67,it kept them excitedfor a little while last night.
890,00:35:38.40,00:35:38.40,JAKE: I leaped up and swatted something. I didn't know
891,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,what I was swatting.
892,00:35:42.93,00:35:42.93, I don't have any idea what it was.
893,00:35:47.20,00:35:47.20,"PROBST: On day 26, everything changed again"
894,00:35:51.13,00:35:51.13, when the two tribes finally merged.
895,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,You're probably assuming
896,00:35:55.53,00:35:55.53,these gold buffsare for your new tribe?
897,00:35:58.47,00:35:58.47,"Finally, an assumptionthat's right."
898,00:36:00.10,00:36:00.10,(cheering)
899,00:36:01.10,00:36:01.10,Sook Jai and Chuay Gahnare no more.
900,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,"The eight of you are nowone tribe, from here to the end."
901,00:36:07.03,00:36:07.03, Brian won the first individual reward challenge
902,00:36:10.20,00:36:10.20, and got to watch a video from home.
903,00:36:13.23,00:36:13.23,"Hey, honey!Congratulations."
904,00:36:15.07,00:36:15.07,I guess you won.
905,00:36:16.73,00:36:16.73,"Hey, Daddy."
906,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,BRIAN: I didn't want everyone to know
907,00:36:19.20,00:36:19.20,more about me than they should.
908,00:36:20.63,00:36:20.63, Didn't think it was necessary for them to see my family.
909,00:36:22.93,00:36:22.93,CECE:And there's your car.
910,00:36:24.77,00:36:24.77,HELEN: The nice two brand-new cars in the garage.
911,00:36:26.63,00:36:26.63, It looks like Brian's doing
912,00:36:28.63,00:36:28.63,pretty damn good for himself.
913,00:36:30.57,00:36:30.57," If I were against Brian right now,"
914,00:36:32.10,00:36:32.10, that'd be enough to vote him off.
915,00:36:36.60,00:36:36.60,PROBST: Everyone's patience was running a little thin.
916,00:36:38.90,00:36:38.90," On day 27, Clay was growing tired of Ted."
917,00:36:42.47,00:36:42.47,"I love him to death,but just his attitude"
918,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,"is, uh, getting pretty old."
919,00:36:46.43,00:36:46.43,"JAKE: From Clay, I got a sense that they're all"
920,00:36:49.13,00:36:49.13, really tired of Ted.
921,00:36:50.83,00:36:50.83,"Right now, it's Ted."
922,00:36:53.13,00:36:53.13,"Right now, it's... it's Ted."
923,00:36:56.87,00:36:56.87,PROBST: The immunity challenge
924,00:36:58.77,00:36:58.77, came down to a race between Ken and Clay.
925,00:37:00.87,00:37:00.87,Clay has his tenth disk!
926,00:37:03.03,00:37:03.03,Yeah!
927,00:37:05.27,00:37:05.27, Clay walked away with the immunity necklace.
928,00:37:07.40,00:37:07.40,-That's me!-Clay wins immunity!
929,00:37:08.97,00:37:08.97,(cheering)
930,00:37:10.43,00:37:10.43,"I know I look sexy, baby!"
931,00:37:12.07,00:37:12.07,I know I look sexy!
932,00:37:15.23,00:37:15.23,"PROBST: Before Tribal Council, Ken knew he was in trouble."
933,00:37:19.67,00:37:19.67,They've been worried sincesquare one that I was a threat.
934,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,We gotta createa little bit of stir.
935,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,Shake up the chicken coop?
936,00:37:26.33,00:37:26.33,KEN: Chuay Gahn is saying that they're going to vote Ted out.
937,00:37:28.53,00:37:28.53,"If that's the possibilityit might keep me afloat,"
938,00:37:30.70,00:37:30.70,I-I'll throw a vote that way.
939,00:37:33.60,00:37:33.60,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, the former Sook Jais"
940,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20, banded together and hoped that Clay was telling the truth
941,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80, about targeting Ted.
942,00:37:42.13,00:37:42.13,"I didn't want to vote for you,"
943,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,but this is how your own tribe
944,00:37:45.27,00:37:45.27,said that everybody should vote.
945,00:37:50.27,00:37:50.27,PROBST: But Clay had misled Sook Jai.
946,00:37:53.27,00:37:53.27,Ken.
947,00:37:54.97,00:37:54.97, The five members of Chuay Gahn actually targeted Ken.
948,00:37:57.87,00:37:57.87,KEN: I have no regrets about the way I played.
949,00:37:59.73,00:37:59.73, I didn't lie to anybody. I... I played this game
950,00:38:01.70,00:38:01.70,"with integrity,because that's just how I am."
951,00:38:04.23,00:38:04.23,"Ken, the tribe has spoken."
952,00:38:07.80,00:38:07.80,KEN: People a lot of times can't separate
953,00:38:10.07,00:38:10.07, the fact that there's a game
954,00:38:11.87,00:38:11.87, and they-they're going to be judged for what they do.
955,00:38:15.37,00:38:15.37," Me, I can't afford to be judged for that."
956,00:38:17.50,00:38:17.50,I'm a police officer;this is not
957,00:38:18.93,00:38:18.93,what police officersare all about.
958,00:38:20.97,00:38:20.97,"Um, I played the gamelike I would play the game."
959,00:38:24.40,00:38:24.40," I didn't have to lie, I didn't have to do these things,"
960,00:38:26.30,00:38:26.30," but then again, I didn't win, either."
961,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,Survivors ready? Go!
962,00:38:35.60,00:38:35.60,"Jake, you're out. Have a seat."
963,00:38:38.40,00:38:38.40,PROBST: Tribal politics was beginning
964,00:38:40.23,00:38:40.23, to permeate everything...
965,00:38:41.23,00:38:41.23,"Clay, you got tochoose somebody."
966,00:38:43.20,00:38:43.20,You're choosing Brian.
967,00:38:44.87,00:38:44.87," ...even at the reward challenge, where Brian won"
968,00:38:47.43,00:38:47.43,and chose to take Clay with him on an elephant trek.
969,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,"Clay, I couldn't be herewithout you,"
970,00:38:52.03,00:38:52.03,so you deserve half of this.
971,00:38:56.93,00:38:56.93," Brian and Clay traveled to the mainland,"
972,00:39:00.10,00:39:00.10,where they soaked in the beauty
973,00:39:01.33,00:39:01.33, of Thailand from the back of an elephant.
974,00:39:04.77,00:39:04.77,"CLAY: I tried to relax and go with the flow,"
975,00:39:06.63,00:39:06.63, but Brian was terrified of this elephant.
976,00:39:10.30,00:39:10.30,He had a death gripon the side of his chair
977,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37, the whole time.
978,00:39:13.50,00:39:13.50," At any minute, he was ready to jump."
979,00:39:16.13,00:39:16.13,"Hey, you want--"
980,00:39:18.07,00:39:18.07,"Hey, excuse me."
981,00:39:19.37,00:39:19.37,That's fun.
982,00:39:20.77,00:39:20.77,"-(deep rumbling)-Oh, hell."
983,00:39:22.30,00:39:22.30,Sounds like a fart.
984,00:39:24.47,00:39:24.47,We got some serious...
985,00:39:25.63,00:39:25.63,(laughs)
986,00:39:26.83,00:39:26.83,That's what you callblowing your nose.
987,00:39:31.13,00:39:31.13,"PROBST: On day 30,"
988,00:39:32.77,00:39:32.77, Penny was trying to figure out her next move.
989,00:39:35.37,00:39:35.37,I am fighting for my liferight now.
990,00:39:38.23,00:39:38.23,"I did have an original alliance with Jake,"
991,00:39:41.57,00:39:41.57, but now the game has changed.
992,00:39:43.97,00:39:43.97,PROBST: Penny put her betrayal right out in the open
993,00:39:47.10,00:39:47.10, when she helped eliminate her old ally Jake
994,00:39:49.77,00:39:49.77, from the immunity challenge.
995,00:39:52.43,00:39:52.43,"JAKE: You know, I guess, the thing that bothered me most is"
996,00:39:54.77,00:39:54.77, Penny came up and snuffed me right from the very beginning.
997,00:39:57.27,00:39:57.27," But, you know, I guess she had her reasons."
998,00:39:59.53,00:39:59.53, I don't know what they were.
999,00:40:01.30,00:40:01.30,"Helen says B, Vietnam.That is right."
1000,00:40:03.90,00:40:03.90,Snuff his torch.
