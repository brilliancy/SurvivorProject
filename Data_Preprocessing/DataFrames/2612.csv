187,00:12:35.80,00:12:35.80,HISTORIC. THEY MADE THEIR OWN RULES UP TO
188,00:12:37.37,00:12:37.37,FINISH OUT THIS CHALLENGE. BRENDA FALLS IN FIRST.
189,00:12:42.83,00:12:42.83,ANDREA WINS IMMUNITY! ( APPLAUSE )

195,00:13:05.30,00:13:05.30,IT IS YOURS TO DO WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT.

200,00:13:22.20,00:13:22.20,SPLIT THE VOTE. WE'RE GOOD.
201,00:13:23.33,00:13:23.33,ONE OF THEM IS GOING HOME. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
202,00:13:54.87,00:13:54.87,">> YEAH. >> WHERE DID YOU HANG, THIS"
203,00:13:59.57,00:13:59.57,COCHRAN? >> I PUT IT RIGHT UP TOP THERE.

205,00:14:02.77,00:14:02.77,IT. IT'S BASICALLY REYNOLD'S EULOGY
206,00:14:06.30,00:14:06.30,"RIGHT NOW, BUT IF THEY'RE SMART, BOOM, NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE"
207,00:14:09.87,00:14:09.87,"AND BLINDSIDE, SOMEONE WHO COULD REALLY WIN THIS GAME."
208,00:14:13.57,00:14:13.57,"THERE ARE THINGS THEY COULD STILL DO STRATEGICALLY,"
209,00:14:15.90,00:14:15.90,"UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT THE CONDUCTOR RIGHT NOW."
210,00:14:19.67,00:14:19.67,>> HAVE FUN WITH THE INFORMATION.

212,00:14:24.23,00:14:24.23,"BRENDA, YOU WON THE LAST IMMUNITY, COULD I JUST HAVE THIS"
213,00:14:27.20,00:14:27.20,ONE? BUT SHE STOOD ON THAT PERCH FOR
214,00:14:28.93,00:14:28.93,HOURS. SHE REALLY PROVED THAT SHE'S A
215,00:14:30.63,00:14:30.63,"BIG THREAT, SO THERE'S A HUGE PART OF ME THAT REGRETD"
216,00:14:36.93,00:14:36.93,PROMISING TO SHARE THE NOTE WITH BRENDA.
217,00:14:45.00,00:14:45.00,"WHICH I FOUND OUT IT WAS CLIEWT TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AT"
218,00:14:48.30,00:14:48.30,"THAT POINT, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SUSPICIOUS SO I TOLD MY WHOLE"
219,00:14:52.03,00:14:52.03,ALLIANCE.  MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT TODAY IS THE IDOL IS NOT
220,00:14:55.00,00:14:55.00,IN REYNOLD'S OR EDDIE'S HANDS. >> WHAT DOES IT SAY?
221,00:15:02.93,00:15:02.93,">> RIGHT WHERE ERIK IS SITTING, RIGHT?"
222,00:15:05.87,00:15:05.87,>> I COME FROM A FAMILY OF DIGGERS.

226,00:15:16.33,00:15:16.33,THINKING MAN TASK. I CAN PROBABLY TELL HIM WHAT TO
227,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,"DO WITH THE IDOL, HE'LL DO IT, AND BEFORE I HAVE A CHANCE TO"
228,00:15:22.00,00:15:22.00,START CELEBRATING HE'S ALREADY HANDING THE IDOL OVER TO ANDREA.
229,00:15:25.50,00:15:25.50,"DOES HE LEARN NOTHING. >> THANK YOU, ANDREA."
230,00:15:28.27,00:15:28.27,">> THAT GETS US THROUGH THE NEXT VOTE, RIGHT."
231,00:15:30.30,00:15:30.30,">> I REALLY WANT TO GET REYNOLD OUT, BUT I'M STILL CONTEMPLATING"
232,00:15:33.60,00:15:33.60,IF WE THROW A BLINDSIDE IN THERE BECAUSE IT WILL BE AN END GAME
233,00:15:37.03,00:15:37.03,TO GET OUT A STRATEGIC THREAT NOW WHEN THEY DON'T SEE IT
234,00:15:41.47,00:15:41.47,SOME BLINDSIDES NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS TO ME.
235,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,>> IF IT'S WATER CHALLENGES SHE'S GOT IT.
236,00:15:56.93,00:15:56.93,SHE HASN'T PISSED ANYONE OFF. >> I THINK TODAY'S IMMUNITY
237,00:16:00.30,00:16:00.30,CHALLENGE AND THE FIGHT DEMONSTRATED BY PLAYERS LIKE
238,00:16:02.97,00:16:02.97,ANDREA AND BRENDA MARKED POSSIBLY THE BEGINNING OF THE
239,00:16:05.27,00:16:05.27,END FOR THE ALLIANCE OF SIX. THERE ARE STILL TWO EASY VOTES
240,00:16:11.10,00:16:11.10,IN REYNOLD AND EDDIE. WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTES BETWEEN
241,00:16:14.40,00:16:14.40,"OF TWO OF THEM, AND ONE WILL BE SENT PACKING."
242,00:16:17.33,00:16:17.33,AND YET WE SEE THE SELF-INTERESTED DESIRE BUBBLING
243,00:16:20.10,00:16:20.10,TO THE SURFACE AND PEOPLE ARE PLAYING FOR THE END GAME FOR
244,00:16:23.67,00:16:23.67,THEIR OWN VICTORY INSTEAD OF A GROUP VICTORY.
245,00:16:25.97,00:16:25.97,>> MAYBE SHE'S ON BOARD AND WILL GO ALONG WITH THE BRENDA VOTE.
246,00:16:29.07,00:16:29.07,I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE EXCITING EVERYONE WOULD
247,00:16:32.30,00:16:32.30,THINK IT WAS REYNOLD. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GOOD.
248,00:16:34.53,00:16:34.53,">> ANDREA IS A SMART PLAYER, AND ANDREA, LIKE ME, IS THINKING"
249,00:16:39.50,00:16:39.50,"WELL BEYOND THE SIX, AND IT'S ANDREA'S OPINION THAT THE RIGHT"
250,00:16:42.63,00:16:42.63,BIG MOVE TO MAKE TO TO BLINDED SIDE BRENDA.
251,00:16:49.00,00:16:49.00,THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT TIMING. >> I DON'T KNOW WHO THE BIGGEST
252,00:16:55.93,00:16:55.93,"THREAT IS. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE BRENDA IS A"
253,00:16:58.80,00:16:58.80,THREAT. BUT I WANT REYNOLD GONE.
254,00:17:03.50,00:17:03.50,HE'S DISRUPTIVE FOR MY BRAIN. >> I THINK IT'S BRENDA.
255,00:17:06.00,00:17:06.00,I THINK SHE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT TO US.
256,00:17:08.70,00:17:08.70,">> OH, MY GOSH. >> I DON'T WANT TO SEE SOMEONE"
257,00:17:11.00,00:17:11.00,"LIKE THAT WIN, BUT THEY WOULD. >> THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE BEEN"
258,00:17:13.77,00:17:13.77,IN THE GAME. TO BE THIS CLOSE MAKES ME FEEL
259,00:17:16.47,00:17:16.47,LIKE THESE DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE THE REALLY CRITICAL ONES
260,00:17:18.77,00:17:18.77,FOR ME. THE BEST THING FOR THE ALLIANCE
261,00:17:20.43,00:17:20.43,WOULD BE TO HAVE PROBABLY EDDIE OR REYNOLD GO NEXT.
262,00:17:25.27,00:17:25.27,BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN OPTION TO BLINDSIDE BRENDA.
263,00:17:28.73,00:17:28.73,THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FOR ME IS NOT HAVING AN OPPONENT OUT HERE.
264,00:17:32.00,00:17:32.00,THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FOR ME HAS BEEN MY MIND.
265,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
266,00:17:57.40,00:17:57.40,MIKE. PHILLIP.
267,00:17:58.90,00:17:58.90,"AND MALCOLM, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL."
268,00:18:05.33,00:18:05.33,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S IMMUNITY AND REWARD CHALLENGE.
269,00:18:09.73,00:18:09.73,EDDIE AND ERIK OPT OUT OF THE CHALLENGE EARLY ON FOR FOOD.
270,00:18:14.63,00:18:14.63,"WHAT WAS YOUR RATIONALE, EDDIE, GIVEN THAT YOU AND REYNOLD HAVE"
271,00:18:17.83,00:18:17.83,BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE FOR A LONG TIME?
272,00:18:19.77,00:18:19.77,">> TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE"
273,00:18:22.10,00:18:22.10,TO STAND ON THAT THING FOR MORE THAN MAYBE AN HOUR TOPS.
274,00:18:25.73,00:18:25.73,"SO I JUMPED TO EAT, PRETTY MUCH. AND I KIND OF SACRIFICED SOME"
275,00:18:29.97,00:18:29.97,SECURITY AND SELF PRIDE FOR A FEW DONUTS.
276,00:18:32.50,00:18:32.50,( LAUGHTER ). >> Jeff: SO THEN COCHRAN DROPS
277,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,"OUT OF THE CHALLENGE. THEN DAWN AND SHERRI, AND THAT"
278,00:18:37.43,00:18:37.43,"LEAVES US WITH BRENDA, ANDREA, AND REYNOLD."
279,00:18:41.30,00:18:41.30,"SO ONCE REYNOLD FALLS OUT, WHY DID YOU TWO STAY UP THERE"
280,00:18:45.10,00:18:45.10,"ANOTHER TWO, THREE HOURS? WHY, IF THERE'S SUCH A TIGHT"
281,00:18:51.30,00:18:51.30,"BOND OF SIX, DIDN'T YOU JUST MAKE A DEAL AND SAY YOU TAKE IT,"
282,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,"I'VE HAD IT, LET'S GO? >> WHEN DO YOU GET THE"
283,00:18:57.77,00:18:57.77,OPPORTUNITY TO TEST YOURSELF LIKE THAT.
284,00:18:59.10,00:18:59.10,"IT WASN'T NECESSARILY A LOT OF FUN, BUT I'M HAPPY THAT I GOT"
285,00:19:02.67,00:19:02.67,"BEAT VERSUS THEY JUMPED OFF. >> Jeff: REYNOLD, IT IS A"
286,00:19:06.60,00:19:06.60,LITTLE CURIOUS THAT THEY DON'T JUST MAKE A DEAL AND GET DOWN IF
287,00:19:09.30,00:19:09.30,THEY'RE SO TIGHT. IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU
288,00:19:12.30,00:19:12.30,"THINKING MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT, AND MAYBE THERE'S AN"
289,00:19:14.77,00:19:14.77,"OPENING FOR ME SOMEWHERE? >> YEAH, I'M A GUY EVERYONE"
290,00:19:17.93,00:19:17.93,"ASSUMES IS GOING TO BE HOME, BUT I COULD BE A GREAT INSTRUMENT."
291,00:19:21.90,00:19:21.90,"ANY MOVES YOU WANT TO MAKE. >> Jeff: COCHRAN, REYNOLD'S"
292,00:19:29.53,00:19:29.53,APPROACH TO COME IN AND TRY AND STIR IT UP IS VALID IN ONE
293,00:19:30.70,00:19:30.70,SENSE. IT'S TIMING.
294,00:19:31.20,00:19:31.20,"HE'S SAYING IF NOW'S THE TIME TO MAKE A MOVE, USE ME."
295,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,">> I MEAN, IT IS TIMING. IF YOU'RE TOO LATE, THAT MEANS"
296,00:19:36.07,00:19:36.07,YOU'RE GOING TO BE VOTED OFF. IT'S ABOUT MAKE THE MOVE THE
297,00:19:39.20,00:19:39.20,SECOND A MOVE IS ABOUT TO BE MADE AGAINST YOU.
298,00:19:41.57,00:19:41.57,AND IT TAKES A LOT OF SELF-AWARENESS TO BE ABLE TO
299,00:19:43.37,00:19:43.37,"PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> Jeff: AND, DAWN, NO"
300,00:19:46.80,00:19:46.80,"COMFORTABLE YOU FEEL, IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S YOU THAT'S ON THE"

303,00:19:57.67,00:19:57.67,IT IS FOR ME TO TRUST PEOPLE AT ALL BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT
304,00:20:01.93,00:20:01.93,"TRUSTWORTHY AT TIMES, OR HAVEN'T BEEN."
305,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,>> Jeff: WHAT DAWN HAS SAID IS ONE OF THE MOST HONEST THINGS
306,00:20:06.90,00:20:06.90,SOMEBODY HAS SAID AT TRIBAL. YOUR PARANOIA COMES FROM
307,00:20:10.53,00:20:10.53,SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

312,00:20:26.70,00:20:26.70,"ABOUT YOUR ALLIANCE? >> OH, YEAH."
313,00:20:28.17,00:20:28.17,TALL TAKES IS FOR ONE PERSON TO FLIP OVER AND YOU'RE GONE.

366,00:24:47.90,00:24:47.90,ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT. AND THE OBVIOUS IS WHY TONIGHT
367,00:24:50.67,00:24:50.67,WE BLINDSIDE SOMEBODY WHEN THEY DON'T SEE IT COMING AND THIS IS
368,00:24:54.33,00:24:54.33,GOING TO COME DOWN WHO WE DECIDE IS THE BIGGER THREAT.
369,00:24:58.37,00:24:58.37,WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IT'S A GAME FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
370,00:25:00.63,00:25:00.63,"AND IF WE DON'T DO IT, THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT TO US."
371,00:25:03.57,00:25:03.57,IT HAS TO BE DAWN OR BRENDA. I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN THEM.

378,00:25:29.87,00:25:29.87,BUT IT'S A BIG MOVE I DON'T AGREE WITH.
379,00:25:32.63,00:25:32.63,"ONCE AGAIN SHE'S TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT BRENDA, AND DAWN, WHO"
380,00:25:37.00,00:25:37.00,IS PROBABLY MY CLOSEST ALLY IN THE GAME.

387,00:25:55.37,00:25:55.37,WANT ANDREA OUT OF THE GAME BECAUSE SHE WANTS ME OUT OF THE
388,00:25:57.70,00:25:57.70,GAME. IT WOULD ALMOST BE EASIER TO GET

520,00:35:29.37,00:35:29.37,IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH. I'M WRITING DOWN ANDREA AND HOPE
521,00:35:32.40,00:35:32.40,I DON'T GO HOME. SO I'M IN HUGE DANGER.
522,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,BUT THE PLAN'S ALREADY BEEN ENACTED.
523,00:35:37.17,00:35:37.17,I JUST HAVE TO JUST LET IT RIDE. >> GOTCHA.

531,00:36:28.83,00:36:28.83,MUMP SAID SHE WANTS TO TAKE ME ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
532,00:36:31.87,00:36:31.87,I PRETTY MUCH BELIEVE IT. SO I HAVE AN IN WITH BOTH
533,00:36:34.77,00:36:34.77,ALLIANCES AT THIS POINT. BOTH ALLIANCES THINK I'M ON
534,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,THEIR SIDE. BUT COCHRAN HASN'T PROMISED ME
535,00:36:39.53,00:36:39.53,"FINAL THREE, SO IF THEY SPLIT THE VOTE, I COULD TOTALLY SHAKE"
536,00:36:42.33,00:36:42.33,THINGS UP. I FEEL SO MUCH CALMER TODAY.
537,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,>> YEAH. >> IT'S THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED
538,00:36:48.37,00:36:48.37,THE GAME. I WAS PRETTY MUCH AT THE MERCY
