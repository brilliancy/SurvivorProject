3,00:00:05.23,00:00:05.23,>> This is a new day we're starting here!
4,00:00:09.37,00:00:09.37,>> The people that play this game fairly have a good chance
5,00:00:12.50,00:00:12.50,to get to the top. >> PROBST: The remaining members
6,00:00:15.20,00:00:15.20,of John's shattered alliance fought with each other to stay
7,00:00:18.33,00:00:18.33,"in the game. >> From the get go, I didn't"
8,00:00:20.70,00:00:20.70,like you. >> PROBST: Sean and Paschal won
9,00:00:22.60,00:00:22.60,a Marquesan feast in the reward challenge.
10,00:00:24.80,00:00:24.80,">> Felt like Julius Caesar, man. >> PROBST: And they smuggled"
11,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03,some food back to share with the rest of the tribe.
12,00:00:30.73,00:00:30.73,>> Thank you so much for bringing food back.
13,00:00:33.07,00:00:33.07,That is so nice of you. >> PROBST: Tammy won a crucial
14,00:00:35.93,00:00:35.93,"immunity challenge. >> Whoo! Yes, yes, yes!"
15,00:00:37.87,00:00:37.87,">> PROBST: And Soliantu went to Tribal Council, where Zoe was"
16,00:00:41.10,00:00:41.10,"voted out of the tribe. Zoe, the tribe has spoken."
17,00:00:43.77,00:00:43.77,Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
18,00:00:54.73,00:00:54.73,( theme song playing ) >> Day 28.
19,00:02:03.27,00:02:03.27,">> Ain't got long, sweetheart. >> I know."
20,00:02:06.23,00:02:06.23,"11 days. 11 days to go, that's it."
21,00:02:08.67,00:02:08.67,>> It was cold last night. >> It was freezing last night.
22,00:02:12.83,00:02:12.83,">> Good morning. How you doing, Sean?"
23,00:02:15.50,00:02:15.50,>> Can't sleep. >> Can't sleep.
24,00:02:17.73,00:02:17.73,My mattress. >> It's got some lumps.
25,00:02:20.33,00:02:20.33,It's lumpy. Lumpy.
26,00:02:21.57,00:02:21.57,">> We're all one big family, man, we spoon, we snuggle, but"
27,00:02:25.90,00:02:25.90,it's strictly for keeping warm. I mean the whole love tribe
28,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,aspect of this game has been a fallacy to a certain point.
29,00:02:34.50,00:02:34.50,"Let's call ourselves the love tribe when this game is over,"
30,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,like will you really call me? Will I really call you?
31,00:02:44.33,00:02:44.33,I think there are certain people who genuinely are affectionate
32,00:02:49.13,00:02:49.13,and feel family vibes. But in the context of a game
33,00:02:53.00,00:02:53.00,"where people are trying to position themselves, can a love"
34,00:02:57.40,00:02:57.40,tribe truly exist? >> Don't you know it's your
35,00:03:03.57,00:03:03.57,birthday? You're not supposed to be
36,00:03:04.70,00:03:04.70,"working on your birthday. >> Well, it is my birthday."
37,00:03:07.47,00:03:07.47,">> Is it true? >> Yes, it is."
38,00:03:09.47,00:03:09.47,">> Oh, my God, are you 20? Or 21."
39,00:03:13.23,00:03:13.23,">> Happy birthday, girlfriend. Birthday girl!"
40,00:03:16.13,00:03:16.13,>> Got to blow it out. >> In celebration of V's
41,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,"birthday, we cut open the last two bananas and mango."
42,00:03:23.77,00:03:23.77,"Made her a little candle and sang to her this morning, 'cause"
43,00:03:26.87,00:03:26.87,"we knew that was going to be the best meal of the day, so..."
44,00:03:30.67,00:03:30.67,">> Thank you, guys, so much. >> Happy birthday."
45,00:03:33.50,00:03:33.50,">> If I wasn't at home, you guys are the next best thing to be"
46,00:03:37.30,00:03:37.30,with. >> That's very sweet.
47,00:03:38.93,00:03:38.93,">> V's birthday was pretty subdued, but as much as I could,"
48,00:03:42.53,00:03:42.53,"I kept trying to make her feel a little bit special, being that,"
49,00:03:46.47,00:03:46.47,"you know, she's not with her husband and her family."
50,00:03:53.37,00:03:53.37,">> I feel like we're all like used spark plugs, because I'm"
51,00:03:57.07,00:03:57.07,"telling you it's a very, very difficult time for me food wise"
52,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,and just from the energy perspective.
53,00:04:02.80,00:04:02.80,">> We don't really have much choice in our dinner, lunch and"
54,00:04:06.27,00:04:06.27,"breakfast menu is pretty much troko, taro and definitely"
55,00:04:09.50,00:04:09.50,"coconut. >> You know, we tried in the"
56,00:04:11.63,00:04:11.63,"beginning, everybody's been out there, trying to catch"
57,00:04:14.80,00:04:14.80,something. And even though we talk about
58,00:04:17.10,00:04:17.10,"it, I think our energy wanes as the day goes on, and the odds of"
59,00:04:20.83,00:04:20.83,us actually catching a fish are unfortunately diminishing.
60,00:04:31.37,00:04:31.37,">> There are black tip baby sharks right here, in our front"
61,00:04:34.87,00:04:34.87,yard. And I'm determined.
62,00:04:38.67,00:04:38.67,They swim right under my feet. I'm going to see if I can whack
63,00:04:42.60,00:04:42.60,it because they come so close. You can see their little black
64,00:04:45.17,00:04:45.17,fins popping out of the water. They're right here.
65,00:04:48.63,00:04:48.63,But there's too much wave action here to see them.
66,00:04:52.10,00:04:52.10,"They're taunting us, it's crazy. It would be great food."
67,00:05:01.00,00:05:01.00,">> You know what? From today's reward challenge, I"
68,00:05:03.77,00:05:03.77,would give anything if the reward was food.
69,00:05:07.80,00:05:07.80,">> I never thought I could feel the inside of my ribs, but I do."
70,00:05:10.87,00:05:10.87,">> Oh, I'd give anything if it was Oreo cookies and have, like,"
71,00:05:14.47,00:05:14.47,"Twix or Snickers ice cream to put on top of the Oreo cookie,"
72,00:05:17.87,00:05:17.87,and just inhale. >> All the food that we've been
73,00:05:20.60,00:05:20.60,"dreaming about. >> Snickers, s'mores."
74,00:05:22.67,00:05:22.67,">> Oh, big fudge brownie. >> Big fudge brownie."
75,00:05:25.10,00:05:25.10,">> A hot skillet with caramel. >> Oh, God!"
76,00:05:29.30,00:05:29.30,"Oh, that sounds so good! >> I think the sugar food"
77,00:05:42.93,00:05:42.93,fantasy is making things worse for everybody.
78,00:05:45.37,00:05:45.37,"They just sort of get people lethargic on a raft, thinking"
79,00:05:48.50,00:05:48.50,about it and talking about it instead of getting up and taking
80,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,"some action to find new food. It's fun, but at the same time I"
81,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27,do think the diversion is wrong. I don't think it's healthy.
82,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57,"So I'm going to try to do some different things for food, and"
83,00:06:01.97,00:06:01.97,also mentally it's just a diversion.
84,00:06:03.93,00:06:03.93,It feels better than sitting around talking about sweets.
85,00:06:12.10,00:06:12.10,">> V, I'm holding on to a thread, baby."
86,00:06:14.03,00:06:14.03,threat. What are you talking about?
87,00:06:16.83,00:06:16.83,">> Just my energy, I can't put it into words."
88,00:06:21.07,00:06:21.07,I'm just trying to hold on. >> We're just trying to conserve
89,00:06:23.40,00:06:23.40,energy. It is a pull to get through the
90,00:06:26.90,00:06:26.90,day now. This is without a doubt the
91,00:06:30.13,00:06:30.13,worst place I have ever been on Earth.
92,00:06:33.53,00:06:33.53,"And it's just a constant battle of dirt, filth, heat, sand,"
93,00:06:38.90,00:06:38.90,"wind, insects. Everything about it is nasty,"
94,00:06:43.30,00:06:43.30,"dirty, filthy-- it's just pure hell."
95,00:06:50.50,00:06:50.50,>> See if my check came in. >> Let's see.
96,00:06:53.03,00:06:53.03,"A place mat. >> ""You're about to hit rock"
97,00:06:56.73,00:06:56.73,"bottom."" >> All right, let's show this to"
98,00:07:01.83,00:07:01.83,everybody else. >> Was there anything else in
99,00:07:05.03,00:07:05.03,there? >> Let me see.
100,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,Yep. Here.
101,00:07:10.23,00:07:10.23,"Birthday wish, baby. Come on, give me a birthday hug."
102,00:07:15.63,00:07:15.63,"\xe2\x99\xaa Happy birthday to you \xe2\x99\xaa Happy birthday, dear Vecepia."
103,00:07:25.63,00:07:25.63,And I don't even sing. \xe2\x99\xaa Happy birthday to you \xe2\x99\xaa
104,00:07:33.57,00:07:33.57,">> Oh, my brother. Thank you so much."
105,00:07:36.10,00:07:36.10,>> I know how much this means to be away from home and our family
106,00:07:39.77,00:07:39.77,on this day. I just want to tell you happy
107,00:07:42.93,00:07:42.93,"birthday, sister, I love you, okay?"
108,00:07:45.57,00:07:45.57,">> No one likes to be away from home on their birthday, of"
109,00:07:48.93,00:07:48.93,course not. But at that point that was kind
110,00:07:53.20,00:07:53.20,of tough. Because I really hadn't thought
111,00:07:56.37,00:07:56.37,too much about being away from Leander on my birthday.
112,00:08:00.80,00:08:00.80,So it was a little special and a little sad as well.
113,00:08:08.13,00:08:08.13,I miss him so much. I can't wait to see him.
114,00:08:11.90,00:08:11.90,>> I know. >> But we are here and we are
115,00:08:15.17,00:08:15.17,"going to do this. God is with us, each and every"
116,00:08:17.93,00:08:17.93,day. >> We've been blessed beyond our
117,00:08:21.67,00:08:21.67,"means, okay. We can head back and give it"
118,00:08:23.67,00:08:23.67,100%. We'll have a nice meal there.
119,00:08:25.40,00:08:25.40,>> That's right. We gotta remember that.
120,00:08:27.10,00:08:27.10,">> Exactly. >> You guys, we got some good"
121,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,tree mail! >> Very good.
122,00:08:39.13,00:08:39.13,>> Somebody may be getting a nice hot shower.
123,00:08:42.00,00:08:42.00,">> Ready? ""Should we just give you"
124,00:08:43.97,00:08:43.97,"treasures, I wouldn't hold your breath."

129,00:09:01.43,00:09:01.43,">> God, we have to dive again. >> Yeah, we got to go down."
130,00:09:04.43,00:09:04.43,">> Down, and it's going to be tough going underwater."
131,00:09:07.87,00:09:07.87,(indistinct chatter) >> I can swim to save my life if
132,00:09:11.67,00:09:11.67,"you give me a short distance, but I don't really feel too"
133,00:09:15.13,00:09:15.13,comfortable in a whole lot of water.

137,00:09:25.97,00:09:25.97,">> Oh, God, it's going to be hard."
138,00:09:28.00,00:09:28.00,">> Well, hey, I'd like to win a reward."
139,00:09:30.37,00:09:30.37,I'd like to win something. I need something.

143,00:09:57.13,00:09:57.13,First round starts with all seven of you.
144,00:09:59.40,00:09:59.40,Scattered along the bottom of the ocean floor are six shells.
145,00:10:02.80,00:10:02.80,They're marked by yellow rocks to make them more visible.
146,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,The seven of you are going to dive down.
147,00:10:08.27,00:10:08.27,Who ever comes up without a shell is eliminated.
148,00:10:11.27,00:10:11.27,"Next round, six people dive down for only five shells; we'll do"
149,00:10:15.20,00:10:15.20,this until we have four tribe members left.
150,00:10:17.87,00:10:17.87,Those four will compete then in a final sprint from the dock
151,00:10:21.63,00:10:21.63,to the shore carrying a 40-pound rock underwater.
152,00:10:24.70,00:10:24.70,First one to drop the rock at my feet wins the reward.
153,00:10:27.83,00:10:27.83,This is what you're playing for. (laughter)
154,00:10:34.80,00:10:34.80,My personal Visa. Which I will loan you for one
155,00:10:37.87,00:10:37.87,night. You'll take this Visa and you'll
156,00:10:40.37,00:10:40.37,book yourself a room on a luxury cruise ship.
157,00:10:43.23,00:10:43.23,That cruise ship right out there.

159,00:10:48.17,00:10:48.17,make your way to your room. I imagine you'll want to take a

161,00:10:55.93,00:10:55.93,of clothes. New clothes for the first time
162,00:10:58.63,00:10:58.63,in 28 days. You'll then make your way to one
163,00:11:02.03,00:11:02.03,of the observation decks where you will enjoy a full course
164,00:11:05.00,00:11:05.00,meal. All right.

179,00:12:22.20,00:12:22.20,Sean got a shell! Yes!
180,00:12:26.37,00:12:26.37,(cheering) Nice job.
181,00:12:31.17,00:12:31.17,>> Way to go. Whoo! >> PROBST: Now you just got to
182,00:12:33.77,00:12:33.77,do it again. Moving on to the next round.
183,00:12:36.03,00:12:36.03,"V, you can head back to the beach."
184,00:12:37.90,00:12:37.90,This round we're looking for five.
185,00:12:39.80,00:12:39.80,There are five shells. Survivors ready!
186,00:12:41.97,00:12:41.97,Go! General and Paschal got a shell.

188,00:13:10.07,00:13:10.07,Neleh's got a shell. There it is.
189,00:13:12.53,00:13:12.53,We got all five. Nice work.
190,00:13:14.57,00:13:14.57,"Kathy, General, Neleh, Tammy, Paschal, moving on."
191,00:13:18.30,00:13:18.30,"Sean, when you get your breath, you're swimming in."
192,00:13:22.10,00:13:22.10,"Nice effort. Here we go, guys."
193,00:13:24.33,00:13:24.33,First four back with shells move on to the final round.
194,00:13:28.83,00:13:28.83,Survivors ready! Go!
195,00:13:38.47,00:13:38.47,"Get down there Neleh, go! Kathy's got one."
196,00:13:49.47,00:13:49.47,Tammy's got one. Paschal's got one.
197,00:13:52.07,00:13:52.07,"General's got it. That's it, Neleh."
198,00:13:54.67,00:13:54.67,Catch your breath. Neleh is going to swim on back.
199,00:13:58.40,00:13:58.40,You four stay here. Wait for my go.
200,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,First one to bring a yellow stone back to me wins.
201,00:14:05.47,00:14:05.47,Survivors ready! Go!
202,00:15:04.63,00:15:04.63,">> Come on, Pappy! Bring it home!"
203,00:15:07.60,00:15:07.60,">> Yeah, Pappy! >> Come on, Pap!"
204,00:15:09.77,00:15:09.77,>> PROBST: Paschal is pulling away.
205,00:15:12.07,00:15:12.07,"(cheering) >> Come on, baby!"
206,00:15:15.63,00:15:15.63,">> Come on, baby, come on now! >> Come on, Pappy!"
207,00:15:19.10,00:15:19.10,>> Bring it home! >> Don't look back.
208,00:15:21.57,00:15:21.57,Don't look back. You're doing great.
209,00:15:23.87,00:15:23.87,"Come on, man. >> Come on, Paps."
210,00:15:25.23,00:15:25.23,(all cheering Paschal on) >> PROBST: Nice job.
211,00:15:41.37,00:15:41.37,"Well earned. >> Thank you, Jeff."
212,00:15:42.23,00:15:42.23,">> PROBST: Here's the deal. I'll hold on to the Visa card,"
213,00:15:44.47,00:15:44.47,we're going to bring the cruise ship to you.
214,00:15:46.60,00:15:46.60,We'll get you a shower and some food.
215,00:15:47.90,00:15:47.90,"Guys, good effort, everybody out there."
216,00:16:02.57,00:16:02.57,">> Wow, Pappy, your own cruise ship."
217,00:16:04.23,00:16:04.23,"There it is! Oh, Pap, way to go, baby."
218,00:16:07.80,00:16:07.80,>> Very cool. >> All of a sudden there's this
219,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,"cruise ship, and the closer the ship got, the more excited I"
220,00:16:14.17,00:16:14.17,got. And I was ready to swim out to
221,00:16:16.57,00:16:16.57,it. It's a beautiful sight.
222,00:16:18.43,00:16:18.43,All for me. >> Don't cheat yourself on the
223,00:16:25.77,00:16:25.77,"desserts, Pas, you know that. >> You know what's really good,"
224,00:16:29.17,00:16:29.17,"bananas foster, because we're on French Polynesia."
225,00:16:32.03,00:16:32.03,>> That's the thing to get? >> That's a French dessert.
226,00:16:34.13,00:16:34.13,">> Just open up the menu and say okay, bring it all on."
227,00:16:38.10,00:16:38.10,">> Paschal! Come on aboard. >> Bye, guys!"
228,00:16:44.20,00:16:44.20,">> Bye! >> Bye, Pappy."
229,00:16:45.90,00:16:45.90,He's going to be in a warm shower in no time.
230,00:16:51.50,00:16:51.50,">> PROBST: Okay, I got to tell you."
231,00:16:53.03,00:16:53.03,I hate for you to have this great experience all alone.
232,00:16:55.80,00:16:55.80,">> Okay, >> PROBST: So, is there one"
233,00:16:58.60,00:16:58.60,tribe member you want to bring? >> You got to be kidding me.
234,00:17:00.87,00:17:00.87,>> PROBST: No. >> Neleh!
235,00:17:03.17,00:17:03.17,"(Neleh screams) >> Oh, wow."
236,00:17:06.33,00:17:06.33,">> Have fun, Neleh! >> There was no conscious"
237,00:17:09.13,00:17:09.13,decision; it was automatic spontaneous reaction.
238,00:17:12.00,00:17:12.00,She's just the epitome of a young lady that deserves it.
239,00:17:15.33,00:17:15.33,It was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy something together.
240,00:17:18.90,00:17:18.90,(Neleh shrieks) >> You deserved it.
241,00:17:24.00,00:17:24.00,">> Did she deserve as much as anybody else? I mean, to me, it"
242,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,"was V's birthday that day. She was feeling a little down,"
243,00:17:30.77,00:17:30.77,"and I don't know, had I won I would definitely have picked V."
244,00:17:35.17,00:17:35.17,(Neleh screaming) >> Bye!
245,00:17:37.57,00:17:37.57,">> Oh, my God! Oh, that is so sweet."
246,00:17:49.43,00:17:49.43,">> If I go home tomorrow, I will be like the happiest woman in"
247,00:17:52.47,00:17:52.47,the whole wide world. We were just beside ourselves
248,00:17:55.47,00:17:55.47,with excitement. I've never been on a cruise ship
249,00:17:58.33,00:17:58.33,"before, and I had never thought that it would be that beautiful."
250,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,>> Thank you. >> Thank you.
251,00:18:03.73,00:18:03.73,"Oh, it smells so good, Paschal. Here, Pappy and I, we're"
252,00:18:09.07,00:18:09.07,"these grubby little rugrats coming on to this really, really"
253,00:18:12.20,00:18:12.20,nice cruise ship. It was just awesome.
254,00:18:14.20,00:18:14.20,">> PROBST: Here's the deal, my Visa card."
255,00:18:16.33,00:18:16.33,Michelle's going to check you in.
256,00:18:18.03,00:18:18.03,Enjoy your night. >> We appreciate it.
257,00:18:19.97,00:18:19.97,>> PROBST: Okay. >> Thank you.
258,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,">> PROBST: Bye, guys. >> Bye, bye, Jeff."
259,00:18:23.63,00:18:23.63,"Thanks. Hello, how you doing?"
260,00:18:25.53,00:18:25.53,>> Good. >> This is really something.
261,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,This is beautiful. >> This is your room key.
262,00:18:29.50,00:18:29.50,Welcome aboard. >> Thank you so much.
263,00:18:32.20,00:18:32.20,We're going to take you to your room.
264,00:18:34.83,00:18:34.83,">> Oh, wow! >> Oh, look at this."
265,00:18:36.57,00:18:36.57,">> Oh, my heavens. Paschal, there's candy right"
266,00:18:39.80,00:18:39.80,away! Our clothes-- we haven't had
267,00:18:41.23,00:18:41.23,forever! >> Look at the view!
268,00:18:44.13,00:18:44.13,"Oh, How cool is this! I mean look at this!"
269,00:18:48.10,00:18:48.10,This is our own boat. The ship was just absolutely
270,00:18:51.30,00:18:51.30,beautiful. I can imagine how the royalties
271,00:18:54.73,00:18:54.73,"of people on Earth must live, because that's what we were"
272,00:18:57.77,00:18:57.77,"presented with. >> Oh, my gosh, Paschal, look at"
273,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"yourself in the mirror. >> Oh, no!"
274,00:19:03.50,00:19:03.50,>> It was just so weird to see myself for the first time.
275,00:19:07.40,00:19:07.40,"My hair looked like it was dark brown, just greasy dread locks."
276,00:19:11.80,00:19:11.80,It was just gross. It just felt so refreshing to
277,00:19:15.10,00:19:15.10,have hot water just pouring down your body.
278,00:19:18.10,00:19:18.10,"I mean, this was like luxury. I put my hair up in this nice"
279,00:19:22.20,00:19:22.20,"fluffy white towel, put lotion all over."
280,00:19:24.97,00:19:24.97,>> Whoo! Gosh! That was wonderful!
281,00:19:26.87,00:19:26.87,I haven't felt this good in over a month.
282,00:19:29.70,00:19:29.70,>> I felt like a whole new person.
283,00:19:32.13,00:19:32.13,"I didn't even feel like I was in the game anymore, to tell you"
284,00:19:37.27,00:19:37.27,"the truth. This is a dream come true,"
285,00:19:40.27,00:19:40.27,Paschal. We are so lucky to be here.
286,00:19:43.20,00:19:43.20,I'm so lucky to be here with you.
287,00:19:49.13,00:19:49.13,">> Oh, look at this. >> Oh, my heck!"
288,00:19:51.73,00:19:51.73,"Oh, cool. We went around the corner and"
289,00:19:54.73,00:19:54.73,"there's this one table set up, with the white linen cloth, like"
290,00:19:59.67,00:19:59.67,"ten pieces of silverware. >> Cheers, darling, my little"
291,00:20:03.93,00:20:03.93,"daughter. >> Cheers, Pappy."
292,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,">> Oh, look what's coming. >> Don't even."
293,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,"Oh, my gosh, it's bread! >> Thanks."
294,00:20:11.87,00:20:11.87,"Oh, wow. Oh, my heck."
295,00:20:13.47,00:20:13.47,>> The best bread I've ever had. >> The best butter I've ever
296,00:20:18.23,00:20:18.23,had. >> To see them go off onto that
297,00:20:30.27,00:20:30.27,boat and we came back here to prepare our muscley troko
298,00:20:34.10,00:20:34.10,shells. That was a tough one.
299,00:20:36.10,00:20:36.10,None of us was happy. >> Neleh is probably ordering
300,00:20:39.63,00:20:39.63,desert first. And then again desserts.
301,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,>> Neleh's hair is probably nicely conditioned and
302,00:20:43.97,00:20:43.97,"shampooed, and it's probably just flowing so nicely right"
303,00:20:46.83,00:20:46.83,now. >> I bet you she got it blow
304,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47,"dried. >> Just beautiful, and having a"
305,00:20:50.37,00:20:50.37,really good time. >> You guys think they'll be
306,00:20:52.67,00:20:52.67,able to smuggle any food back? >> Yeah.
307,00:21:01.30,00:21:01.30,">> So the next thing that came out was, oh, what's it called,"
308,00:21:06.00,00:21:06.00,"what's the delicacy? >>Escargot, that's for you, sir."
309,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,>> Thank you so much. I don't think I've ever
310,00:21:16.77,00:21:16.77,"had escargot. I knew what escargot was, but I"
311,00:21:18.53,00:21:18.53,couldn't envision that snail would taste good.
312,00:21:23.00,00:21:23.00,>> Wow. >> Oh.
313,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,">> Yum! >> Oh, my heck."
314,00:21:28.80,00:21:28.80,"Cream potatoes, vegetables. >> Oh, my heck."
315,00:21:34.27,00:21:34.27,>> Would you care to have some wine?
316,00:21:36.60,00:21:36.60,>> I wouldn't care for any. >> I wouldn't either.
317,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,>> Thank you. >> I just hope they don't get
318,00:21:42.53,00:21:42.53,upset and vote me out because of this.
319,00:21:44.97,00:21:44.97,>> Paschal! >> Dessert was the final course
320,00:21:47.73,00:21:47.73,and it was creme brulee which I've never eaten in my life.
321,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,">> Ooh, what is that? >> It is so sugary."
322,00:21:53.83,00:21:53.83,"Man, that was good. I was really looking forward to"
323,00:21:58.23,00:21:58.23,the bill because I had no idea what something like this would
324,00:22:03.63,00:22:03.63,"cost, I figured maybe $150. >> Holy cow!"
325,00:22:07.07,00:22:07.07,"Oh, my heck! >> The bill was $312."
326,00:22:10.00,00:22:10.00,Which of course I didn't flinch because it was not my money.
327,00:22:14.77,00:22:14.77,"It could have been $3,000 and it wouldn't have mattered to me."
328,00:22:19.17,00:22:19.17,Tip. That's $200.
329,00:22:20.33,00:22:20.33,">> Thank you, sir. >> Worth every penny of it."
330,00:22:23.57,00:22:23.57,"Thank you very much. >> Thank you, sir."
331,00:22:26.30,00:22:26.30,Have a nice evening. >> Thank you.
332,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,">> $200 tip. >> Paschal, I can't laugh"
333,00:22:31.37,00:22:31.37,anymore. I'm going to puke.
334,00:22:42.23,00:22:42.23,>> They're going to have beer breath.
335,00:22:43.93,00:22:43.93,>> Neleh doesn't drink and neither does Paschal.
336,00:22:46.60,00:22:46.60,They got the wrong people on board to do some drinking.
337,00:22:49.67,00:22:49.67,">> Boy, that's for sure. >> I would have been throwing"
338,00:22:52.67,00:22:52.67,them back. >> We were all sitting on the
339,00:22:54.87,00:22:54.87,raft waiting for them to come back.
340,00:22:56.80,00:22:56.80,"Everybody sitting there wondering, do you think they're"
341,00:22:59.97,00:22:59.97,going to bring food back? Do you think they're going to
342,00:23:03.10,00:23:03.10,bring food? >> Hi!
343,00:23:04.03,00:23:04.03,>> Hi. Did you have a great time?
344,00:23:05.57,00:23:05.57,">> Oh, wow. >> Look at your blow-dried hair."
345,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,">> We had the best time. >> Don't get near me, I smell."
346,00:23:10.33,00:23:10.33,">> Hi, guys! >> Oh, I'm going to puke if I"
347,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,"get too close. >> Hi, guys."
348,00:23:13.87,00:23:13.87,>> Look how cleaned up you guys are.
349,00:23:16.33,00:23:16.33,">> The first thing I did was I stuck my face in Neleh's hair,"
350,00:23:20.53,00:23:20.53,and her hair just smelled fantastic.
351,00:23:27.10,00:23:27.10,">> There's a bathroom off to the right and they had, you know,"
352,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,the shampoo and the like a loofah sponge.
353,00:23:33.03,00:23:33.03,I had to take the loofah sponge and literally scrub.
354,00:23:36.03,00:23:36.03,"It's almost like when you peel stuff off your body, it's like"
355,00:23:39.57,00:23:39.57,that black flaky stuff. >> She was going on a little too
356,00:23:42.80,00:23:42.80,much about her shower and how clean she was.
357,00:23:45.33,00:23:45.33,"She's so damn sweet. >> Anyway, and so the first"
358,00:23:48.10,00:23:48.10,thing they brought out was a big basket of bread.
359,00:23:51.07,00:23:51.07,And then after that... >> The food sounded really good.
360,00:23:54.43,00:23:54.43,It kind of sucked listening to them describe it in detail.
361,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,">> I wish so bad I could have brought something back, you"
362,00:24:01.57,00:24:01.57,guys. I feel horrible telling you guys
363,00:24:03.87,00:24:03.87,about this. Did you guys feel horrible
364,00:24:06.57,00:24:06.57,"telling us? >> No, but then we also brought"
365,00:24:09.17,00:24:09.17,back some food. >> The only thing I have left to
366,00:24:11.80,00:24:11.80,share is this mint that I shoved in my mouth really fast.
367,00:24:15.30,00:24:15.30,So if everybody wants to take a little nibble.
368,00:24:17.97,00:24:17.97,">> I'm okay, sweetheart. >> Come on, you guys."
369,00:24:20.67,00:24:20.67,"It's good, it's a little hard mint; I don't want it."
370,00:24:22.70,00:24:22.70,>> You're offering seven starving adults a piece of candy
371,00:24:26.03,00:24:26.03,"out of your mouth. Keep your mint candy, man."
372,00:24:28.67,00:24:28.67,"You know, that's like saying anybody want this piece of doo-"
373,00:24:32.20,00:24:32.20,doo. >> Nobody wants this?
374,00:24:58.27,00:24:58.27,">> Morning, guys. >> Good morning."
375,00:25:00.37,00:25:00.37,">> Look how clean you are. >> Oh, man."
376,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,I had the best night's sleep ever.
377,00:25:04.70,00:25:04.70,">> The next morning when we wake up, Neleh is still on the clean"
378,00:25:08.63,00:25:08.63,"kick, just kind of being the princess."
379,00:25:10.93,00:25:10.93,"And has her feet propped up in her new clean clothes, looking"
380,00:25:15.27,00:25:15.27,at her nails. >> Can't believe my skin is
381,00:25:17.60,00:25:17.60,clean. >> This is so weird.
382,00:25:19.13,00:25:19.13,>> Who cares if your nails are clean or dirty?
383,00:25:21.77,00:25:21.77,"I mean, there's chores to be done and there's regular living"
384,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,back on Soliantu. She's one of those people who
385,00:25:33.83,00:25:33.83,"cleverly will have the perception that she's working,"
386,00:25:36.50,00:25:36.50,but I don't really see her carrying jugs.
387,00:25:38.57,00:25:38.57,"I don't see her lifting wood, I don't really see her doing the"
388,00:25:41.70,00:25:41.70,work that she says she's doing. But she's always the first one
389,00:25:44.87,00:25:44.87,"to go, ""I have so much energy."" I'm like I would too, if I"
390,00:25:47.70,00:25:47.70,wasn't doing anything but taking naps and walking and relaxing.
391,00:25:58.80,00:25:58.80,">> How is your porridge coming, Kath?"
392,00:26:00.63,00:26:00.63,">> Well, let me see the ingredients."
393,00:26:03.77,00:26:03.77,>> I think it's going to taste just like it did the other day.
394,00:26:09.37,00:26:09.37,>> Yuck. >> Do you want porridge or do we
395,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,want flank steak? (Paschal chuckling)
396,00:26:21.13,00:26:21.13,">> I hear you, Pappy. >> You do?"
397,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,>> I think Neleh has definitely snowed Paschal and everyone
398,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,else. I think she's playing this game
399,00:26:31.60,00:26:31.60,"harder than anybody left on this island, and she's playing sweet"
400,00:26:35.90,00:26:35.90,"little girl next-door, and before you know it, hey, I'm in"
401,00:26:39.77,00:26:39.77,"the finals and I'm so happy, and oh, God, this is, oh heck."
402,00:26:43.73,00:26:43.73,">> And the bread, then you dip it..."
403,00:26:46.10,00:26:46.10,">> Hey, Neleh, you want to get green leaves for our taro?"
404,00:26:49.93,00:26:49.93,">> Absolutely. Porridge hot, porridge cold."
405,00:26:56.80,00:26:56.80,>> I think Neleh has about 60 to 70% sweetness and about 30% or
406,00:26:59.80,00:26:59.80,40% she's working it. I think it's a little much right
407,00:27:04.93,00:27:04.93,"now, and she's working it too hard."
408,00:27:06.93,00:27:06.93,"She genuinely cares for everyone here, but I think she's working"
409,00:27:10.70,00:27:10.70,it with Paschal. She's hovering under his wings
410,00:27:13.43,00:27:13.43,"for protection. >> Paschal, do you want any"
411,00:27:15.93,00:27:15.93,"taro? >> No thank you, not right now."
412,00:27:18.70,00:27:18.70,">> Where is that creme brulee? >> Hey, big man, come here and"
413,00:27:26.63,00:27:26.63,"sit in the shade. >> I just had a little coconut,"
414,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63,and now I'm ready to do pig snare.
415,00:27:31.73,00:27:31.73,Who wants to help? >> A pig snare?
416,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83,">> Sure. He comes out here every night,"
417,00:27:36.27,00:27:36.27,and he's about this tall. I got a good look at him.
418,00:27:39.43,00:27:39.43,So I got a pig that comes down into our camp every night.
419,00:27:43.30,00:27:43.30,"I'm getting a little tired of him taunting me, so I want to go"
420,00:27:47.83,00:27:47.83,and catch that thing and make some pork chops.
421,00:27:51.20,00:27:51.20,"I figured this one, we bend it over that way."
422,00:27:54.47,00:27:54.47,"That way we won't really have to bend it that far, but when he"
423,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,"lashes it, he'll be up. >> Rob is building a pig snare."
424,00:28:03.13,00:28:03.13,I think because not only he's a little bit frustrated that we
425,00:28:07.47,00:28:07.47,"haven't got a pig, but I think Rob wants to secure his place in"
426,00:28:11.97,00:28:11.97,"the tribe. If he doesn't win, you know, the"
427,00:28:17.80,00:28:17.80,"next immunity challenge or the following immunity challenge, at"
428,00:28:20.40,00:28:20.40,"least if he wins a pig, he can hold that up and say, ""Hey, I'm"
429,00:28:24.30,00:28:24.30,"a valuable member of this tribe. Don't vote me out."""
430,00:28:28.37,00:28:28.37,>> It might hold if this one was farther down.
431,00:28:32.07,00:28:32.07,">> Whoa, it's all right. I got it."
432,00:28:34.73,00:28:34.73,">> I catch a pig tonight, you win immunity, and I'm going to"
433,00:28:40.20,00:28:40.20,"tell them, look, she's immune, I caught the pig."
434,00:28:42.70,00:28:42.70,"You can't get rid of me and not let me have any of my pig, you"
435,00:28:46.20,00:28:46.20,"got to keep me, I got a pig. And then he'll pull, look at"
436,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,"that release. >> Guys, we got mail!"
437,00:29:02.63,00:29:02.63,">> Guys, we got mail! >> Mail, at this hour, weird."
438,00:29:05.60,00:29:05.60,>> Sounds like it's happening tonight.
439,00:29:07.80,00:29:07.80,>> Happening tonight? >> Big wow.
440,00:29:09.70,00:29:09.70,">> Big wow. All right, guys, ready?"
441,00:29:11.73,00:29:11.73,">> Yeah. >> ""Race against the others"
442,00:29:13.83,00:29:13.83,"until you're feeling hot. ""The most basic skill of"
443,00:29:16.77,00:29:16.77,"survival, show them what you've got."
444,00:29:18.83,00:29:18.83,"""Food, water and protection, most important in this game."
445,00:29:23.80,00:29:23.80,"""You may as well just pack your bags if you fail to strike"
446,00:29:27.00,00:29:27.00,"flame."" >> Guess what we're doing"
447,00:29:30.90,00:29:30.90,tonight. We're going to have to make fire
448,00:29:32.93,00:29:32.93,tonight. >> We've got to make fire.
449,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,">> That's what it sounds like. >> Yeah, we've got to make fire."
450,00:29:37.87,00:29:37.87,Yet another curve ball. I've been busting my butt all
451,00:29:40.53,00:29:40.53,"day, you know, chopping wood, making a new pig snare and"
452,00:29:43.33,00:29:43.33,everything like that. These other people have been
453,00:29:45.87,00:29:45.87,sleeping all day and resting. I wish I knew that.
454,00:29:48.33,00:29:48.33,"You know, I thought it was a day off."
455,00:29:50.17,00:29:50.17,"It's big stakes for me. I think I don't win, I could go."
456,00:30:13.40,00:30:13.40,>> PROBST: Welcome guys to Tribal Beach.
457,00:30:15.60,00:30:15.60,"First things first. Tammy, you want to give back"
458,00:30:18.80,00:30:18.80,that immunity necklace. Thank you.
459,00:30:21.07,00:30:21.07,"Once again, immunity, up for grabs."
460,00:30:24.90,00:30:24.90,Okay. Here's the deal.
461,00:30:26.27,00:30:26.27,Tonight's game is especially tough because it takes place in
462,00:30:31.80,00:30:31.80,"the dark. First, you're going to run to"
463,00:30:34.07,00:30:34.07,the end of the course and gather firewood from the perimeter.
464,00:30:37.60,00:30:37.60,You will build a fire under a wok to heat oil to pop popcorn.
465,00:30:41.13,00:30:41.13,"Once you've popped one kernel of popcorn, you'll move to a"
466,00:30:44.50,00:30:44.50,final station where you will light your pyre from the bottom
467,00:30:47.97,00:30:47.97,to ignite the top. You'll start your fire in a way
468,00:30:50.87,00:30:50.87,"you haven't done yet. Magnesium, flint and steel."
469,00:30:54.77,00:30:54.77,"First person to ignite the top of their pyre wins immunity,"
470,00:30:59.50,00:30:59.50,"cannot be voted out, guaranteed three more days in this game."
471,00:31:04.47,00:31:04.47,Everything clear? Take your spots.
472,00:31:07.17,00:31:07.17,Wait for my go. Survivors ready!
473,00:31:09.70,00:31:09.70,Go! >> Whoa.
474,00:31:18.43,00:31:18.43,>> PROBST: Think about stuff that's really going to ignite.
475,00:31:20.83,00:31:20.83,"Coconut husks work really well. There you go, V."
476,00:31:53.13,00:31:53.13,V has fire. General's got fire.
477,00:32:04.73,00:32:04.73,V and the General have fire. Everybody else is still working.
478,00:32:20.83,00:32:20.83,That a way Sean. Keep it going.
479,00:32:23.93,00:32:23.93,Kathy's got fire. Sean's got fire.
480,00:32:30.53,00:32:30.53,">> You don't got any matches, do you, Jeff?"
481,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Neleh's got fire.
482,00:32:37.83,00:32:37.83,>> Whoo! How close are we to having
483,00:32:40.37,00:32:40.37,"popcorn? Very close, look at that oil,"
484,00:32:42.20,00:32:42.20,"really heating up. Let's go, General, get one"
485,00:32:44.33,00:32:44.33,kernel to pop and you're moving on.
486,00:32:46.03,00:32:46.03,">> I hear sizzle, man, I hear sizzle."
487,00:32:47.37,00:32:47.37,"Look at that, look at that. Look at that."
488,00:32:48.83,00:32:48.83,"It popped, right there. >> PROBST: General, you got"
489,00:32:50.70,00:32:50.70,"popcorn, baby. Moving on to the third station,"
490,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,you're done here. General's in the lead.
491,00:32:57.07,00:32:57.07,It's getting close. Wok's heating up.
492,00:33:00.70,00:33:00.70,"There it is. V's got popcorn, moving to the"
493,00:33:02.77,00:33:02.77,final station. First one to ignite the top wins
494,00:33:05.03,00:33:05.03,immunity. General's got a good healthy
495,00:33:06.87,00:33:06.87,"fire going, V. You'd better get that fire going"
496,00:33:09.23,00:33:09.23,"fast. General's looking good, very"
497,00:33:14.17,00:33:14.17,"close. Very close, General."
498,00:33:18.10,00:33:18.10,"V's catching up. They're neck and neck, guys."
499,00:33:24.77,00:33:24.77,">> Come on, baby. Yeah! You're close, baby."
500,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,>> PROBST: General. Yeah! Nice work.
501,00:33:34.93,00:33:34.93,"Immunity, brother. Turn around here and let me put"
502,00:33:43.40,00:33:43.40,this on. >> Sanctuary.
503,00:33:46.57,00:33:46.57,>> PROBST: You cannot be voted out.
504,00:33:48.30,00:33:48.30,Congratulations. >> You ain't going nowhere.
505,00:33:58.30,00:33:58.30,I'm going to try my damnedest. (laughter)
506,00:34:20.60,00:34:20.60,">> How tall do you think this is, you guys?"
507,00:34:23.77,00:34:23.77,"Probably about 250 feet, maybe higher."
508,00:34:26.07,00:34:26.07,">> No, about 100 feet. >> 100 feet?"
509,00:34:28.63,00:34:28.63,">> Just won immunity, feeling a little relieved, knowing I'm"
510,00:34:32.00,00:34:32.00,definitely going to be here another three days.
511,00:34:34.73,00:34:34.73,>> Who else gets this? >> It's like being in a
512,00:34:37.43,00:34:37.43,torrential downpour and it's gorgeous.
513,00:34:39.17,00:34:39.17,">> The win was very big for me, just lifted me up and bringing"
514,00:34:42.80,00:34:42.80,"me back to life. I was feeling a little down, and"
515,00:34:45.67,00:34:45.67,now I'm feeling really good about myself again.
516,00:34:48.40,00:34:48.40,That was refreshing. I'm definitely a little bummed
517,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,that it looks like Tammy is on the way out.
518,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,She's like a sister to me. I'd like to see if I could do
519,00:34:57.20,00:34:57.20,something to save her. >> I think Tammy has a play for
520,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,tonight. I just don't know what it is.
521,00:35:02.63,00:35:02.63,I think it's something that's going to get pulled out of a hat
522,00:35:06.27,00:35:06.27,and we're all going to come tumbling down.
523,00:35:09.07,00:35:09.07,All right. >> Over.
524,00:35:10.53,00:35:10.53,">> Hike, hike! >> Over, hike, hike!"
525,00:35:13.83,00:35:13.83,>> I'm not used to losing. I'm super competitive.
526,00:35:18.23,00:35:18.23,And you know what? I'm not giving up on this game
527,00:35:22.03,00:35:22.03,until I hear my name read at Tribal Council.
528,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,>> I'm telling you something. That Tammy is waiting for any
529,00:35:30.03,00:35:30.03,"opening. >> Oh, Tammy's waiting for"
530,00:35:32.73,00:35:32.73,anything. She's like a pit bull.
531,00:35:35.20,00:35:35.20,>> She's waiting there to take advantage of something.
532,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40,">> That's why I'm saying, you know, if she comes up with some"
533,00:35:44.13,00:35:44.13,"plan, I can see her getting V over on her side."
534,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,>> V has definitely flipped more than anybody in this game.
535,00:35:52.40,00:35:52.40,Maybe Rob and Tammy could somehow convince Sean and V
536,00:35:56.50,00:35:56.50,to join their pact. >> A few moments we get to have.
537,00:36:00.60,00:36:00.60,"If V and I hooked up with Tammy and Rob, point blank, it would"
538,00:36:05.47,00:36:05.47,"put us in the final four. My thing is, I'm approaching you"
539,00:36:08.33,00:36:08.33,on this angle. Neleh got mad game.
540,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,She's playing the girl next-door role to the hilt.
541,00:36:12.47,00:36:12.47,It's important that V and I vote Neleh off.
542,00:36:14.57,00:36:14.57,Because she's so young and because she has this angelic
543,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,"girl-next-door, everybody is being deceived by aww, aww, and"
544,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,"not realizing the more sympathy you have, the stronger this girl"
545,00:36:23.43,00:36:23.43,"gets. She talks a good game, let's go"
546,00:36:28.03,00:36:28.03,"do this, let's go do this, but don't do much but sleep and take"
547,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,walks. >> Every now and then she'll
548,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,turn around and pick up something and make it look
549,00:36:34.53,00:36:34.53,"like... >> See, you see exactly what I'm"
550,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,saying. >> It would be a sure bet if V
551,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,"and I hooked up with Tammy and Rob, but then again, it might"
552,00:36:40.60,00:36:40.60,"not be a sure bet, because they may very well go to the other"
553,00:36:43.30,00:36:43.30,"force, and say hey, look, these two tried to hook up with us and"
554,00:36:46.10,00:36:46.10,save their own ass. Then we're on the chopping
555,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,block. >> I'm ready to end this game in
556,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83,"a bang, baby. We are close."
557,00:36:51.67,00:36:51.67,All right. So we'll see what happens.
558,00:36:53.13,00:36:53.13,>> Okay. >> PROBST: I will now bring in
559,00:37:05.20,00:37:05.20,the two members of our jury. I'll remind you the jury is here
560,00:37:08.43,00:37:08.43,merely to observe. This is the beginning of the
561,00:37:11.53,00:37:11.53,"shift in the game, when the power leaves those who are still"
562,00:37:15.50,00:37:15.50,in it and goes now to those who are out of it.
563,00:37:18.53,00:37:18.53,So how you vote becomes very important in this game.
564,00:37:21.97,00:37:21.97,"Tonight I want to talk about what you are tired of, after 30"
565,00:37:25.93,00:37:25.93,days. Neleh.
566,00:37:28.77,00:37:28.77,>> A big part of it is that you are covered in dirt.
567,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,"You know, you wake up in the morning, there's dirt and no-nos"
568,00:37:35.43,00:37:35.43,"stuck inside your eyes. It's just, it's absolutely"
569,00:37:38.37,00:37:38.37,"disgusting, and I mean the nights are bad here."
570,00:37:41.13,00:37:41.13,>> PROBST: Kathy? >> I can't stay on the beach.
571,00:37:43.87,00:37:43.87,"For various reasons, it's the bugs, the monotony, it's the"
572,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,grime. And my skin is literally ready
573,00:37:49.63,00:37:49.63,"to fall off, I've got so many rashes and infections, it's"
574,00:37:53.10,00:37:53.10,"disgusting. >> PROBST: Paschal, what are you"
575,00:37:55.80,00:37:55.80,"sick of out here? >> Just the daily grinds, the"
576,00:37:58.70,00:37:58.70,"monotony, the same food, the same living conditions, the same"
577,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,everything. And the closer we get to the
578,00:38:06.30,00:38:06.30,"end, it seems the more difficult it becomes."
579,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,">> PROBST: On a scale of one to ten, how valuable was the reward"
580,00:38:11.80,00:38:11.80,of going to a cruise ship and being able to take a shower and
581,00:38:15.57,00:38:15.57,get clean clothes and have a good meal?
582,00:38:17.93,00:38:17.93,>> Seven million. Neleh and I sat on the deck of
583,00:38:20.87,00:38:20.87,"that ship and talked about it. There was nothing, nothing that"
584,00:38:24.67,00:38:24.67,I could have received that would have invigorated me more and
585,00:38:28.43,00:38:28.43,made me feel better. It was absolutely amazing.
586,00:38:31.20,00:38:31.20,">> PROBST: Kathy, what was your reaction?"
587,00:38:33.63,00:38:33.63,"Paschal and Neleh come back, not only did they have a shower,"
588,00:38:37.27,00:38:37.27,"they're clipping their nails,. They're doing a little buff pad,"
589,00:38:41.03,00:38:41.03,I mean it was like they went to a spa.
590,00:38:43.27,00:38:43.27,">> Hey, there is no doubt about it, I was jealous."
591,00:38:46.20,00:38:46.20,I think all of us had a difficult time listening to the
592,00:38:47.63,00:38:47.63,blow by blow description of Neleh's shower.
593,00:38:49.47,00:38:49.47,"But Paschal did an incredible job on that challenge, man, so I"
594,00:38:53.83,00:38:53.83,"think when you win, you deserve it."
595,00:38:56.27,00:38:56.27,"And Neleh going, so be it. But I wanted to get him really"
596,00:39:00.37,00:39:00.37,"dirty the next day. >> PROBST: General, you own"
597,00:39:03.67,00:39:03.67,"immunity. If it made sense, you could"
598,00:39:06.27,00:39:06.27,assign that immunity to somebody else.
599,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,"Have you talked about that, is there somebody here you want to"
600,00:39:12.60,00:39:12.60,give that up to? Do you feel safe enough?
601,00:39:15.20,00:39:15.20,">> No, I got to stay. >> PROBST: It's time to vote."
602,00:39:18.47,00:39:18.47,"Neleh, you're first. >> Tammy, you're one cool chick"
603,00:39:53.47,00:39:53.47,but lethal competition. Take it easy.
604,00:40:18.30,00:40:18.30,>> You don't seem to pull your weight actually as much as
605,00:40:20.83,00:40:20.83,everybody else pulls theirs. So that's why I'm voting for you
606,00:40:23.97,00:40:23.97,tonight. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
607,00:40:43.57,00:40:43.57,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
608,00:40:56.93,00:40:56.93,decision is final. The person will be asked to
609,00:40:59.13,00:40:59.13,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
610,00:41:01.43,00:41:01.43,I'll read the votes. First vote...
611,00:41:07.30,00:41:07.30,Tammy. Tammy.
612,00:41:20.53,00:41:20.53,Vecepia. Vecepia.
613,00:41:31.83,00:41:31.83,"Two votes Tammy, two votes V. That's three votes Tammy."
614,00:41:52.50,00:41:52.50,"Tammy. That's four, that's enough."
615,00:41:55.80,00:41:55.80,"You need to bring me your torch. Tammy, the tribe has spoken."
616,00:42:19.30,00:42:19.30,"Well, you made it 30 days; I know you're having a hard time,"
617,00:42:22.33,00:42:22.33,but nobody ever said Survivor was going to be easy.
618,00:42:25.03,00:42:25.03,Nine more days left. Hang in there.
619,00:42:26.90,00:42:26.90,You guys can head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes
620,00:42:42.30,00:42:42.30,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
621,00:42:48.70,00:42:48.70, Survivor: Only six remain at
622,00:42:50.07,00:42:50.07,"Soliantu, and island life has taken its toll on all of them."
623,00:42:52.93,00:42:52.93,">> We're just depleted energy wise, and it's really uncanny to"
624,00:42:55.93,00:42:55.93,see what's happening with our mental stability.
625,00:42:58.17,00:42:58.17,>> PROBST: And an event occurs that will shakeup the entire
626,00:43:01.10,00:43:01.10,tribe. >> It takes an experience like
627,00:43:02.87,00:43:02.87,this to realize what really is important in your life.
628,00:43:12.53,00:43:12.53,">> Even though I knew tonight was coming, and it was my turn,"
629,00:43:16.03,00:43:16.03,it still sucks to be voted off. I've played this game exactly
630,00:43:19.57,00:43:19.57,the way I said I was going to play it and I'm proud of the way
631,00:43:23.13,00:43:23.13,"I played it. This is the game of Survivor,"
632,00:43:25.57,00:43:25.57,"the people that are left, I hope that they have it in them to"
633,00:43:29.07,00:43:29.07,"last the rest of the time, because I'm not so sure they do."
