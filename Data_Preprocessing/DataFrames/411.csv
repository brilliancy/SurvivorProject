79,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,"some action to find new food.It's fun, but at the same time I"
80,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27,do think the diversion is wrong.I don't think it's healthy.
81,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57,"So I'm going to try to do somedifferent things for food, and"
82,00:06:01.97,00:06:01.97,also mentally it's just adiversion.

375,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,I had the best night's sleepever.
376,00:25:04.70,00:25:04.70,">> The next morning when we wakeup, Neleh is still on the clean"
377,00:25:08.63,00:25:08.63,"kick, just kind of being theprincess."
378,00:25:10.93,00:25:10.93,"And has her feet propped up inher new clean clothes, looking"
379,00:25:15.27,00:25:15.27,at her nails.>> Can't believe my skin is
380,00:25:17.60,00:25:17.60,clean.>> This is so weird.
381,00:25:19.13,00:25:19.13,>> Who cares if your nails areclean or dirty?
382,00:25:21.77,00:25:21.77,"I mean, there's chores to bedone and there's regular living"
383,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,back on Soliantu.She's one of those people who
384,00:25:33.83,00:25:33.83,"cleverly will have theperception that she's working,"
385,00:25:36.50,00:25:36.50,but I don't really see hercarrying jugs.
386,00:25:38.57,00:25:38.57,"I don't see her lifting wood, Idon't really see her doing the"
387,00:25:41.70,00:25:41.70,work that she says she's doing.But she's always the first one
388,00:25:44.87,00:25:44.87,"to go, ""I have so much energy.""I'm like I would too, if I"
389,00:25:47.70,00:25:47.70,wasn't doing anything but takingnaps and walking and relaxing.
390,00:25:58.80,00:25:58.80,">> How is your porridge coming,Kath?"
391,00:26:00.63,00:26:00.63,">> Well, let me see theingredients."
392,00:26:03.77,00:26:03.77,>> I think it's going to tastejust like it did the other day.
393,00:26:09.37,00:26:09.37,>> Yuck.>> Do you want porridge or do we
394,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,want flank steak?(Paschal chuckling)
395,00:26:21.13,00:26:21.13,">> I hear you, Pappy.>> You do?"
396,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,>> I think Neleh has definitelysnowed Paschal and everyone
397,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,else.I think she's playing this game
398,00:26:31.60,00:26:31.60,"harder than anybody left on thisisland, and she's playing sweet"
399,00:26:35.90,00:26:35.90,"little girl next-door, andbefore you know it, hey, I'm in"
400,00:26:39.77,00:26:39.77,"the finals and I'm so happy, andoh, God, this is, oh heck."
401,00:26:43.73,00:26:43.73,">> And the bread, then you dipit..."
402,00:26:46.10,00:26:46.10,">> Hey, Neleh, you want to getgreen leaves for our taro?"
403,00:26:49.93,00:26:49.93,">> Absolutely.Porridge hot, porridge cold."
404,00:26:56.80,00:26:56.80,>> I think Neleh has about 60 to70% sweetness and about 30% or
405,00:26:59.80,00:26:59.80,40% she's working it.I think it's a little much right
406,00:27:04.93,00:27:04.93,"now, and she's working it toohard."
407,00:27:06.93,00:27:06.93,"She genuinely cares for everyonehere, but I think she's working"
408,00:27:10.70,00:27:10.70,it with Paschal.She's hovering under his wings
409,00:27:13.43,00:27:13.43,"for protection.>> Paschal, do you want any"
410,00:27:15.93,00:27:15.93,"taro?>> No thank you, not right now."
411,00:27:18.70,00:27:18.70,">> Where is that creme brulee?>> Hey, big man, come here and"
412,00:27:26.63,00:27:26.63,"sit in the shade.>> I just had a little coconut,"
413,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63,and now I'm ready to do pigsnare.
414,00:27:31.73,00:27:31.73,Who wants to help?>> A pig snare?
415,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83,">> Sure.He comes out here every night,"
416,00:27:36.27,00:27:36.27,and he's about this tall.I got a good look at him.
417,00:27:39.43,00:27:39.43,So I got a pig that comes downinto our camp every night.
418,00:27:43.30,00:27:43.30,"I'm getting a little tired ofhim taunting me, so I want to go"
419,00:27:47.83,00:27:47.83,and catch that thing and makesome pork chops.
420,00:27:51.20,00:27:51.20,"I figured this one, we bend itover that way."
421,00:27:54.47,00:27:54.47,"That way we won't really have tobend it that far, but when he"
422,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,"lashes it, he'll be up.>> Rob is building a pig snare."
423,00:28:03.13,00:28:03.13,I think because not only he's alittle bit frustrated that we
424,00:28:07.47,00:28:07.47,"haven't got a pig, but I thinkRob wants to secure his place in"
425,00:28:11.97,00:28:11.97,"the tribe.If he doesn't win, you know, the"
426,00:28:17.80,00:28:17.80,"next immunity challenge or thefollowing immunity challenge, at"
427,00:28:20.40,00:28:20.40,"least if he wins a pig, he canhold that up and say, ""Hey, I'm"
428,00:28:24.30,00:28:24.30,"a valuable member of this tribe.Don't vote me out."""
429,00:28:28.37,00:28:28.37,>> It might hold if this one wasfarther down.
430,00:28:32.07,00:28:32.07,">> Whoa, it's all right.I got it."
431,00:28:34.73,00:28:34.73,">> I catch a pig tonight, youwin immunity, and I'm going to"
432,00:28:40.20,00:28:40.20,"tell them, look, she's immune, Icaught the pig."
433,00:28:42.70,00:28:42.70,"You can't get rid of me and notlet me have any of my pig, you"
434,00:28:46.20,00:28:46.20,"got to keep me, I got a pig.And then he'll pull, look at"
435,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,"that release.>> Guys, we got mail!"
436,00:29:02.63,00:29:02.63,">> Guys, we got mail!>> Mail, at this hour, weird."
437,00:29:05.60,00:29:05.60,>> Sounds like it's happeningtonight.
438,00:29:07.80,00:29:07.80,>> Happening tonight?>> Big wow.

515,00:34:48.40,00:34:48.40,That was refreshing.I'm definitely a little bummed
516,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,that it looks like Tammy is onthe way out.
517,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,She's like a sister to me.I'd like to see if I could do
518,00:34:57.20,00:34:57.20,something to save her.>> I think Tammy has a play for
519,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,tonight.I just don't know what it is.
520,00:35:02.63,00:35:02.63,I think it's something that'sgoing to get pulled out of a hat
521,00:35:06.27,00:35:06.27,and we're all going to cometumbling down.
522,00:35:09.07,00:35:09.07,All right.>> Over.
523,00:35:10.53,00:35:10.53,">> Hike, hike!>> Over, hike, hike!"

527,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,>> I'm telling you something.That Tammy is waiting for any

529,00:35:32.73,00:35:32.73,anything.She's like a pit bull.
530,00:35:35.20,00:35:35.20,>> She's waiting there to takeadvantage of something.
531,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40,">> That's why I'm saying, youknow, if she comes up with some"
532,00:35:44.13,00:35:44.13,"plan, I can see her getting Vover on her side."
533,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,>> V has definitely flipped morethan anybody in this game.
534,00:35:52.40,00:35:52.40,Maybe Rob and Tammy couldsomehow convince Sean and V
535,00:35:56.50,00:35:56.50,to join their pact.>> A few moments we get to have.
536,00:36:00.60,00:36:00.60,"If V and I hooked up with Tammyand Rob, point blank, it would"
537,00:36:05.47,00:36:05.47,"put us in the final four.My thing is, I'm approaching you"
538,00:36:08.33,00:36:08.33,on this angle.Neleh got mad game.
539,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,She's playing the girl next-doorrole to the hilt.
540,00:36:12.47,00:36:12.47,It's important that V and I voteNeleh off.
541,00:36:14.57,00:36:14.57,Because she's so young andbecause she has this angelic
542,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30,"girl-next-door, everybody isbeing deceived by aww, aww, and"
543,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,"not realizing the more sympathyyou have, the stronger this girl"
544,00:36:23.43,00:36:23.43,"gets.She talks a good game, let's go"
545,00:36:28.03,00:36:28.03,"do this, let's go do this, butdon't do much but sleep and take"
546,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,walks.>> Every now and then she'll
547,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,turn around and pick upsomething and make it look
548,00:36:34.53,00:36:34.53,"like...>> See, you see exactly what I'm"
549,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,saying.>> It would be a sure bet if V
550,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,"and I hooked up with Tammy andRob, but then again, it might"
551,00:36:40.60,00:36:40.60,"not be a sure bet, because theymay very well go to the other"
552,00:36:43.30,00:36:43.30,"force, and say hey, look, thesetwo tried to hook up with us and"
553,00:36:46.10,00:36:46.10,save their own ass.Then we're on the chopping
554,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,block.>> I'm ready to end this game in
555,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83,"a bang, baby.We are close."
556,00:36:51.67,00:36:51.67,All right.So we'll see what happens.

571,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,grime.And my skin is literally ready

573,00:37:53.10,00:37:53.10,"disgusting.>> PROBST: Paschal, what are you"

576,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,everything.And the closer we get to the
577,00:38:06.30,00:38:06.30,"end, it seems the moredifficult it becomes."
578,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,">> PROBST: On a scale of one toten, how valuable was the reward"
579,00:38:11.80,00:38:11.80,of going to a cruise ship andbeing able to take a shower and

582,00:38:20.87,00:38:20.87,"that ship and talked about it.There was nothing, nothing that"
583,00:38:24.67,00:38:24.67,I could have received that wouldhave invigorated me more and
