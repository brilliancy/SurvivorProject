4,00:00:12.97,00:00:12.97,"made it past the halfway point. Tonight, in a special episode"
5,00:00:16.97,00:00:16.97,"of highlights and never before seen footage, we'll take a"
6,00:00:20.47,00:00:20.47,closer look at their adventure thus far.

8,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,question my integrity over a piece of beef jerky means a lot
9,00:00:28.33,00:00:28.33,to me. >> RODGER: Maybe I've been
10,00:00:30.83,00:00:30.83,"playing the Kentucky Joe part a little bit too much, and maybe I"
11,00:00:33.67,00:00:33.67,need to come out a little bit more.

15,00:02:14.63,00:02:14.63,anywhere on Earth-- the Australian outback.
16,00:02:18.07,00:02:18.07,"As two separate tribes, Kucha and Ogakor, they gathered"
17,00:02:22.47,00:02:22.47,"whatever supplies they could carry, and began a five-mile"
18,00:02:25.60,00:02:25.60,hike to find their camps. It didn't take long for certain
19,00:02:30.27,00:02:30.27,"personalities to clash. >> DEBB: Nick, stay in the"
20,00:02:37.27,00:02:37.27,"front, Nick, and keep us going north to northeast, okay?"
21,00:02:40.67,00:02:40.67,">> NICK: Even from the beginning, people were"
22,00:02:42.70,00:02:42.70,automatically getting on people's nerves.
23,00:02:44.83,00:02:44.83,"We were walking through the grass, and Kimmi was like I"
24,00:02:46.97,00:02:46.97,can't stand Debb. >> KIMMI: Debb is not even a bad
25,00:02:48.63,00:02:48.63,person. She means well.
26,00:02:51.33,00:02:51.33,It's just she's not somebody in the outside world I would talk
27,00:02:54.40,00:02:54.40,"to, because she'd make me crazy. >> DEBB: See, if we're going"
28,00:02:57.03,00:02:57.03,"southwest, how are we going to get the dry quickbed?"
29,00:02:59.20,00:02:59.20,>> ELISABETH: Because that's north!
30,00:03:00.30,00:03:00.30,">> DEBB: That's right. >> COLBY: You all right,"
31,00:03:06.77,00:03:06.77,Maralyn? That trek let me know that this
32,00:03:09.37,00:03:09.37,was for real. That was a long trek we had
33,00:03:12.57,00:03:12.57,"through deep sand, and that fired me up, because that is the"
34,00:03:16.13,00:03:16.13,quickest way to find out what people are made of.
35,00:03:19.10,00:03:19.10,>> AMBER: This rice is very heavy.
36,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,I really want to get there soon. ( whooping and cheering )
37,00:03:25.60,00:03:25.60,>> JEFF: Once the tribes had found the flags and canoes that
38,00:03:28.90,00:03:28.90,"marked their beaches, the mood was upbeat."
39,00:03:31.47,00:03:31.47,"( whooping ) But with night approaching,"
40,00:03:40.10,00:03:40.10,Kucha and Ogakor turned to the serious task of assessing their
41,00:03:43.10,00:03:43.10,living conditions. >> DEBB: We got enough rocks
42,00:03:45.53,00:03:45.53,"here, too. We could build a pretty decent"
43,00:03:48.27,00:03:48.27,"shelter just using rocks. >> MITCHELL: Colby, his luxury"
44,00:03:51.17,00:03:51.17,"item was the Texan flag, which is great, because it covers us"
45,00:03:54.43,00:03:54.43,and blocks us from the wind and the sun.
46,00:03:56.87,00:03:56.87,">> COLBY: Don't get me wrong. When I wake up in the morning,"
47,00:03:59.43,00:03:59.43,there's two things I'm thankful for.
48,00:04:00.83,00:04:00.83,"I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan."
49,00:04:03.30,00:04:03.30,>> JEFF: Keith and Jerri got off to a shaky start.
50,00:04:07.07,00:04:07.07,">> JERRI: No, but it's not going to stay."
51,00:04:09.33,00:04:09.33,"But see, we put it on the grommet for a reason, so that"
52,00:04:13.10,00:04:13.10,the flag wouldn't rip. >> KEITH: You can't.
53,00:04:15.30,00:04:15.30,You won't be able to go through that on a flat surface.
54,00:04:17.47,00:04:17.47,>> JERRI: Tension between Keith and I...
55,00:04:19.67,00:04:19.67,I think him and I kind of rubbed each other the wrong way.
56,00:04:25.73,00:04:25.73,">> JEFF: On the first night at Ogakor, sleep was hard to come"
57,00:04:29.87,00:04:29.87,by thanks to Colby. ( loud snoring )
58,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,"( snoring continues ) >> MARALYN: God, has anybody"
59,00:04:51.20,00:04:51.20,gotten any quality of sleep? >> KEITH: Colby.
60,00:04:57.13,00:04:57.13,We had added a new sound to the outback.
61,00:04:59.77,00:04:59.77,"MARALYN: Oh, Jesus. >> KEITH: All these critters are"
62,00:05:04.27,00:05:04.27,going what the hell is that animal!?
63,00:05:06.70,00:05:06.70,( soft laughter ) >> COLBY: I snored?
64,00:05:12.57,00:05:12.57,">> Trust me, you were snoring. >> It's like you had sucked sand"
65,00:05:15.43,00:05:15.43,"into your nose. >> Oh, man!"
66,00:05:17.40,00:05:17.40,">> COLBY: It doesn't bother me much, but... might explain why I"
67,00:05:20.43,00:05:20.43,"don't have a girlfriend, I don't know."
68,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,( women groaning sympathetically )
69,00:05:24.37,00:05:24.37,">> JERRI: I hate to say it, but you're probably right."
70,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,( laughter ) >> MITCHELL: I'm a little
71,00:05:35.43,00:05:35.43,annoyed because I'm waiting for Kelly to pull his stuff
72,00:05:38.43,00:05:38.43,"together, 'cause we're going to go fishing, but it should be a"
73,00:05:42.20,00:05:42.20,good trip 'cause he might tell me some things that might be
74,00:05:45.23,00:05:45.23,useful to any strategies that we may have planned.
75,00:05:48.40,00:05:48.40,"I mean, he's a nice enough guy, but if there is one person to"
76,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37,"vote off right now, it definitely would be him."
77,00:05:59.10,00:05:59.10,">> KEL: See, there's like a rope hanging from that limb over"
78,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93,"there? >> MITCHELL: All right, now I"
79,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33,see it. I wonder what the other team is
80,00:06:05.93,00:06:05.93,planning. >> KEL: You think they'd be
81,00:06:08.90,00:06:08.90,talking about that that early in the game?
82,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,">> MITCHELL: I don't know. >> KEL: So, we have nothing in"
83,00:06:13.47,00:06:13.47,here? >> MITCHELL: Do you see anybody
84,00:06:16.33,00:06:16.33,as the weakest yet? >> KEL: Everybody has some very
85,00:06:18.77,00:06:18.77,"strong strengths. I mean, have you thought about"
86,00:06:20.20,00:06:20.20,"that? I mean, obviously you have, to"
87,00:06:25.20,00:06:25.20,"ask it. >> MITCHELL: Well, I think we"
88,00:06:28.33,00:06:28.33,all have; it's kind of inevitable.
89,00:06:29.60,00:06:29.60,"In a few days, we're going to have to... right?"
90,00:06:34.57,00:06:34.57,>> KEL: You don't ever learn anything by talking.
91,00:06:37.23,00:06:37.23,"You learn things by listening. Right now I'm listening to them,"
92,00:06:39.93,00:06:39.93,I'm learning about them. Tell me who you think is the
93,00:06:42.10,00:06:42.10,"weakest, then. >> MITCHELL: I don't know."
94,00:06:45.07,00:06:45.07,Maralyn is probably the weakest. Part of me thinks to maybe even
95,00:06:48.60,00:06:48.60,"go for the most threatening too, you know?"
96,00:06:51.20,00:06:51.20,I'm trying to decide which way to go.
97,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,>> KEL: I think Jerri and Mitch would look at me as someone they
98,00:06:56.37,00:06:56.37,would vote off because I would be potentially dangerous to them
99,00:06:59.33,00:06:59.33,because I'm mentally and physically strong.
100,00:07:06.30,00:07:06.30,We're good. We can head back.
101,00:07:09.57,00:07:09.57,>> JEFF: Voting strategy wasn't the only thing on the survivors'
102,00:07:11.80,00:07:11.80,minds. Fire quickly became a priority
103,00:07:15.93,00:07:15.93,for both tribes. >> KIMMI: I'm angry!
104,00:07:18.80,00:07:18.80,"Angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry!"
105,00:07:23.20,00:07:23.20,We're generating some sparks. We tried every way to get this
106,00:07:27.43,00:07:27.43,"fire going. Yes, I was smashing the rock,"
107,00:07:30.53,00:07:30.53,"but I made it into an energy release, because you just can't"
108,00:07:33.77,00:07:33.77,"say to people you're a jerk-off, shut up, so you focus your"
109,00:07:36.67,00:07:36.67,"energy somewhere else, and you're fine."
110,00:07:41.97,00:07:41.97,">> AMBER: Fire. ( loud, abrasive squeaking )"
111,00:07:48.37,00:07:48.37,>> Whoo! ( high-pitched whooping )
112,00:07:58.30,00:07:58.30,">> JEFF: Despite their efforts, neither tribe succeeded in"
113,00:08:02.00,00:08:02.00,generating more than a few sparks and a little smoke.
114,00:08:05.60,00:08:05.60,">> MARALYN: Until we can get a fire and boil water, we're not"
115,00:08:09.47,00:08:09.47,going to be eating much of anything.
116,00:08:12.23,00:08:12.23,>> JEFF: But luck was about to change for one tribe.
117,00:08:15.83,00:08:15.83,The first challenge brought the hope of fire and immunity.
118,00:08:19.20,00:08:19.20,Waterproof matches. One of the things we're playing
119,00:08:21.97,00:08:21.97,"for tonight, right here. We're also playing for something"
120,00:08:24.40,00:08:24.40,else-- the immunity idol. It was Ogakor who had the first
121,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,taste of victory. Your reward-- waterproof
122,00:08:34.67,00:08:34.67,matches. ( cheering )
123,00:08:37.83,00:08:37.83,"And that night, they had their first taste of hot food as well."
124,00:08:41.23,00:08:41.23,>> One vegetable paella coming up.
125,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,>> JEFF: But professional chef Keith didn't quite live up to
126,00:08:47.10,00:08:47.10,his credentials. >> AMBER: I was pretty surprised
127,00:08:50.13,00:08:50.13,the first time I tasted the rice.
128,00:08:51.53,00:08:51.53,I was really looking forward to a warm meal.
129,00:08:54.40,00:08:54.40,And the first bite was nothing like I imagined.
130,00:08:58.17,00:08:58.17,"I'm not complaining, I promise, but..."
131,00:09:02.00,00:09:02.00,It's hard to eat. >> JERRI: The first time Keith
132,00:09:06.77,00:09:06.77,"made rice, the rice was way undercooked."
133,00:09:09.57,00:09:09.57,"I hate to say it, but it wasn't really very good."
134,00:09:13.17,00:09:13.17,>> COLBY: I don't think the first batch of rice went over
135,00:09:15.50,00:09:15.50,"real well. In fact, I think it went over"
136,00:09:18.47,00:09:18.47,like a pickle in a punchbowl. >> KEITH: Anyone want seconds?
137,00:09:26.23,00:09:26.23,">> JEFF: On Day Three, the torches were lit for the first"
138,00:09:29.10,00:09:29.10,"Tribal Council. For Kucha, there was little"
139,00:09:36.03,00:09:36.03,question about who should be the first person voted out of the
140,00:09:38.10,00:09:38.10,tribe. >> ALICIA: She's very set in her
141,00:09:41.93,00:09:41.93,"ways, she doesn't like to be second guessed, and it makes it"
142,00:09:44.87,00:09:44.87,very hard for us to deal with her in any kind of group
143,00:09:46.47,00:09:46.47,"dynamic. >> NICK: At this point, I think"
144,00:09:50.20,00:09:50.20,"that Rodger would probably be the smarter vote, but I think"
145,00:09:53.80,00:09:53.80,that the group dynamics and people fitting in well together
146,00:09:56.77,00:09:56.77,"is important, and Debb is definitely on the outside with"
147,00:09:59.43,00:09:59.43,certain people. >> KIMMI: She just chooses to be
148,00:10:02.93,00:10:02.93,"independent, and she's just a strong-willed person."
149,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,"It's not a bad thing, it's just not what I need."
150,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70,>> JEFF: First person voted out of the tribe... is Debb.
151,00:10:14.97,00:10:14.97,The tribe has spoken. >> JEFF K: It's a reward.
152,00:10:24.23,00:10:24.23,"""A leap of faith is not for the skilled,"
153,00:10:26.47,00:10:26.47,"Just step off the edge, try not to get killed."""
154,00:10:29.37,00:10:29.37,>> JEFF: With Day Four came the first reward challenge-- one
155,00:10:32.53,00:10:32.53,that gave Rodger something to worry about.
156,00:10:35.03,00:10:35.03,>> RODGER: Today's challenge is probably going to be jumping off
157,00:10:37.63,00:10:37.63,a cliff into some water. I just basically learned to swim
158,00:10:40.20,00:10:40.20,"right before we came out here, plus I just never did like"
159,00:10:41.77,00:10:41.77,heights. ( whooping )
160,00:10:45.80,00:10:45.80,"( yelling ) >> Come on, Rodger!"
161,00:11:03.53,00:11:03.53,">> JEFF: Though Rodger gave his all, it wasn't enough to secure"
162,00:11:06.83,00:11:06.83,a Kucha victory. Ogakor crossed the finish line
163,00:11:10.30,00:11:10.30,"first, and walked away with two warm blankets as their reward."
164,00:11:17.53,00:11:17.53,">> RODGER: For five quarts of beans, I'd have jumped off of"
165,00:11:20.77,00:11:20.77,there again. I think.
166,00:11:24.63,00:11:24.63,"Well, after we came back from the award challenge, it's right"
167,00:11:28.97,00:11:28.97,"down the river here a ways, there's a rapids running through"
168,00:11:30.70,00:11:30.70,"there. >> NICK: Hey, guys,"
169,00:11:33.53,00:11:33.53,everybody in the hot tub! \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
170,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,">> ALICIA: They have a rock bed with all this water, just like"
171,00:11:42.67,00:11:42.67,"cascading sounds, like a little waterfall."
172,00:11:44.63,00:11:44.63,Like little white rapids. We all ran and got in.
173,00:11:47.50,00:11:47.50,"It's just like a Jacuzzi, and it's become Kucha Jacuzzi."
174,00:11:54.23,00:11:54.23,">> ELISABETH: It just felt so good on our muscles, and I think"
175,00:11:57.43,00:11:57.43,"for the first time, all the workaholics in our group took"
176,00:12:00.60,00:12:00.60,"like, ten minutes to just think about the fact that we jumped"
177,00:12:04.63,00:12:04.63,off a cliff! >> ALICIA: Rodger!
178,00:12:07.67,00:12:07.67,"Rodger, come on, we got a Jacuzzi going over here!"
179,00:12:14.63,00:12:14.63,">> RODGER: Oh, man, that's... Whoo, that's cold!"
180,00:12:17.97,00:12:17.97,But it feels good. >> I think that our morale was
181,00:12:21.60,00:12:21.60,more positive to see that Kentucky Joe was able to take
182,00:12:24.43,00:12:24.43,"the swan dive off the cliff and be like, you know what, I might"
183,00:12:27.43,00:12:27.43,"not be the best at it, but you know what, I'm not going to let"
184,00:12:30.27,00:12:30.27,"my team down, and that is just like a greater triumph than two"
185,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,blankets. >> RODGER: I'm losing my trunks

200,00:13:17.90,00:13:17.90,And maybe I need to come out a little bit more.
201,00:13:20.40,00:13:20.40,I didn't want the others to have the impression that I'm ready to

277,00:17:30.77,00:17:30.77,not desirable for an alliance. And that's too bad if they're
278,00:17:33.13,00:17:33.13,"playing the game that way, 'cause I'm not going to play"

736,00:40:16.33,00:40:16.33,"reckoned with. See, look at them."
737,00:40:19.23,00:40:19.23,>> JEFF: Elisabeth's hunch about the wavering Ogakor alliance
738,00:40:21.33,00:40:21.33,wasn't farfetched. Even Colby was ready to sever
739,00:40:25.07,00:40:25.07,"all ties with Jerri. >> JERRI: Um, have you ever"
740,00:40:28.00,00:40:28.00,considered leading Keith and Tina to believe that you want
741,00:40:30.57,00:40:30.57,the three of them to be the final three?
742,00:40:34.53,00:40:34.53,"Maybe... >> COLBY: Oh, they're fully"
743,00:40:36.20,00:40:36.20,convinced that's what's going to happen.
744,00:40:37.60,00:40:37.60,">> JERRI: Oh, they are? >> COLBY: I mean, they..."
745,00:40:39.17,00:40:39.17,I was painted into a corner and-and had to lie to her to
746,00:40:41.17,00:40:41.17,convince her that there wasn't anything going wrong.
747,00:40:43.57,00:40:43.57,"I didn't like the fact that I had to lie, but because I was"
748,00:40:46.40,00:40:46.40,"lying to Jerri, I didn't lose sleep over it."
749,00:40:55.47,00:40:55.47,">> JEFF: On day 24, Keith won his second consecutive immunity"
750,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90,"challenge, assuring once again he could not be voted out of the"
751,00:41:01.57,00:41:01.57,tribe. Again!
752,00:41:04.57,00:41:04.57,( applause and cheering ) Congratulations.
753,00:41:06.73,00:41:06.73,"But at Tribal Council, Elisabeth's efforts to get Jerri"
754,00:41:10.50,00:41:10.50,voted out fell short. The fragile Ogakor alliance
755,00:41:14.47,00:41:14.47,"held. >> AMBER: Girl, you're strong"
756,00:41:16.63,00:41:16.63,"inside and out, and, uh, that's the main reason why I have to"
757,00:41:19.10,00:41:19.10,"vote for you, because you're threatening."
758,00:41:20.83,00:41:20.83,>> JERRI: Not only do you intimidate the hell out of the
759,00:41:23.83,00:41:23.83,"women around here, but also the men."
760,00:41:25.93,00:41:25.93,They are scared to death of you. >> KEITH: This is just strictly
761,00:41:28.90,00:41:28.90,"part of the game, and it's part of our process."
762,00:41:31.13,00:41:31.13,>> JEFF: Final vote... Alicia was the eighth member to
763,00:41:34.73,00:41:34.73,"go. Alicia, the tribe has spoken."
764,00:41:43.13,00:41:43.13,But she will return as the first member of the jury that
765,00:41:45.93,00:41:45.93,ultimately decides which of the final two tribe members will be
766,00:41:49.03,00:41:49.03,the sole survivor. The remaining members of
767,00:41:51.47,00:41:51.47,Barramundi must now carefully consider their voting
768,00:41:54.20,00:41:54.20,"strategies, because old tribal loyalties are now less important"
769,00:41:57.57,00:41:57.57,than the good will of this new jury.
770,00:42:16.47,00:42:16.47,>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
771,00:42:22.87,00:42:22.87,Next time on Survivor. Go!
772,00:42:26.13,00:42:26.13,The winner of the reward challenge is flown to an exotic
773,00:42:28.37,00:42:28.37,location. And tribal loyalties start to
774,00:42:31.93,00:42:31.93,unravel. >> COLBY: We're talking about a
775,00:42:34.70,00:42:34.70,"lot of money at stake. >> KEITH: No, I understand that."
776,00:42:36.70,00:42:36.70,I understand that. Kucha tribe's in a great
777,00:42:38.53,00:42:38.53,"position, because we are going to sacrifice one of our Ogakor"
778,00:42:40.47,00:42:40.47,members. >> ALICIA: Whoo!
779,00:42:48.70,00:42:48.70,">> ALICIA & KIMMI: Get it, get it, get it! Get it!"
780,00:42:49.97,00:42:49.97,It's right there! >> KIMMI: Right there!
781,00:42:51.50,00:42:51.50,">> ALICIA: It's right there. Get him, get him."
782,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,>> KIMMI: What is it? >> ALICIA: You got him!
783,00:42:54.10,00:42:54.10,You got him. >> KIMMI: What is it?
784,00:42:55.60,00:42:55.60,>> ALICIA: Whoo! What is it? Can we eat it?
785,00:42:56.90,00:42:56.90,>> JEFF V.: It's a prawn. >> KIMMI: It's a prawn. Yay!
786,00:42:58.50,00:42:58.50,We need a bigger bucket. >> ALICIA: We need bigger...
787,00:43:00.20,00:43:00.20,We need a pot. What do you want me to do?
788,00:43:01.60,00:43:01.60,>> KIMMI: Here. >> JEFF V.: Take it.
789,00:43:02.97,00:43:02.97,( Alicia mumbles ) ( Jeff V. laughs )
790,00:43:04.43,00:43:04.43,">> ALICIA: Oh! >> KIMMI: Oh, no!"
791,00:43:05.83,00:43:05.83,>> ALICIA: No!
