5,00:00:12.87,00:00:12.87,I'M SMARTER THAN I LOOK SOMETIMES.
6,00:00:14.87,00:00:14.87,I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF. I DESERVE THIS MILLION DOLLARS
7,00:00:17.70,00:00:17.70,BUT JUST BECAUSE I DESERVE IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO COME
8,00:00:21.07,00:00:21.07,TO ME ON A SILVER PLATTER. >> Jeff: NATALIE WINS REWARD.
9,00:00:22.77,00:00:22.77,>> I CAN'T LEAVE ANYTHING UP TO FATE.

18,00:00:55.97,00:00:55.97,"ON TWITTER WHEN I WAS SOLICITING QUESTIONS, E.P. ROACHE SAID IT,"
19,00:01:03.40,00:01:03.40,DOES NATALIE THINK YOU DID BETTER BECAUSE YOUR SISTER WAS
20,00:01:05.70,00:01:05.70,VOTED OUT SO EARLY? DID THAT GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF
21,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,INSPIRATION? >> I THINK MY GAME WAS
22,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,DEFINITELY BETTER PLAYING WITHOUT NADIYA.
23,00:01:12.37,00:01:12.37,"THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS EASIER FOR ME, BUT I THINK THE PUSH TO"

29,00:01:30.87,00:01:30.87,HERE IN THE STUDIO WHEN YOU PLAYED THE IDOL FOR JACLYN AND
30,00:01:34.57,00:01:34.57,NOT YOURSELF WAS HUGE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVES OF THE
31,00:01:37.83,00:01:37.83,GAME. BUT THAT IS A GIANT RISK TO GIVE
32,00:01:40.63,00:01:40.63,UP AN IDOL TO MAKE THIS ONE BIG POWER MOVE.
33,00:01:44.17,00:01:44.17,WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT MOMENT?
34,00:01:45.97,00:01:45.97,>> I REMEMBER WALKING INTO TRIBAL AND KNOWING I HAD THIS

41,00:02:08.07,00:02:08.07,WAS GETTING VOTED OUT. I LITERALLY BLACKED OUT WHEN I
42,00:02:10.90,00:02:10.90,DID THAT. I'M NOT EVEN JOKING.
43,00:02:12.47,00:02:12.47,">> Jeff: SO DESPITE HOW BIG A MOVE THAT WAS, MY OPINION, THE"
44,00:02:15.50,00:02:15.50,BIGGEST MOVE OF THE GAME WAS CONVINCING JACLYN TO GET RID OF
45,00:02:20.10,00:02:20.10,KEITH AND NOT YOU. IS THAT-- DO YOU AGREE WITH
46,00:02:22.47,00:02:22.47,"THAT? >> I MEAN, I WOULDN'T-- I"
47,00:02:24.40,00:02:24.40,WOULDN'T HAVE SAT IN THAT FINAL THREE NILS CONVINCED JACLYN THAT
48,00:02:29.03,00:02:29.03,KEITH WAS THE BIGGER THREAT. AND I THINK HAVING MISSY AND

52,00:02:42.70,00:02:42.70,">> Jeff: JACLYN, YOU'RE NOT PRIVY TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE"
53,00:02:45.43,00:02:45.43,SAYING AND DOING. >> RIGHT.
54,00:02:46.67,00:02:46.67,>> Jeff: WHEN YOU'RE NOW AT HOME WATCHING THIS AND YOU SEE
55,00:02:49.40,00:02:49.40,"WHAT'S HAPPENING, DO YOU REGRET THAT MOVE?"
56,00:02:50.93,00:02:50.93,">> MAN, SHE PLAYED ME. AND DURING THE GAME I HAD NO"

58,00:02:57.50,00:02:57.50,THOUGHT KEITH WOULD HAVE ALL THE JURY VOTES.
59,00:02:59.10,00:02:59.10,"I CAME FROM COYOPA, WHERE HE WAS STRONG WITH ALL THE GUYS."
60,00:03:01.93,00:03:01.93,I WAS LIKE HE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT IF I AM IN THE FINAL
61,00:03:04.67,00:03:04.67,THREE WITH HIM. DO IT.
62,00:03:05.73,00:03:05.73,"IF I HAD KNOWN DIFFERENT I WOULD HAVE VOTED NATALIE, BUT I HAD NO"
63,00:03:09.57,00:03:09.57,IDEA. >> Jeff: LET'S SAY YOU VOTE

117,00:06:06.00,00:06:06.00,IT MIGHT EVEN BE HARDER TO PLAY THE GAME WITH PEOPLE-- A LOT OF
118,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,PEOPLE THAT REPORT REAL STRATEGISTS AS OPPOSED TO
119,00:06:13.67,00:06:13.67,PLAYING THE GAME WITH A WHOLE BUNCH --
