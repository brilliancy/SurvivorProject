2,00:00:02.29,00:00:02.29,"Survivor: after eight days, the yellow tribe Foa Foa, had been"
3,00:00:06.92,00:00:06.92,to the first three Tribal Councils.
4,00:00:09.33,00:00:09.33,>> I just want to survive to another day.
5,00:00:11.12,00:00:11.12,I'm tired. I'm hungry.
6,00:00:13.04,00:00:13.04,">> PROBST: Tensions were high. Nerves were frayed, and the"
7,00:00:15.38,00:00:15.38,only person who wasn't miserable was Russell.
8,00:00:18.21,00:00:18.21,>> When people fight I love that.
9,00:00:19.88,00:00:19.88,"Now, I try to start the fight. >> PROBST: He now has the"
10,00:00:21.75,00:00:21.75,hidden immunity idol... >> Boo-yah.
11,00:00:23.42,00:00:23.42,>> PROBST: And a diabolical plan.
12,00:00:25.08,00:00:25.08,>> They can be my little puppets.
13,00:00:26.75,00:00:26.75,"When I'm finished with them, just throw them in the trash."
14,00:00:29.12,00:00:29.12,">> PROBST: Over at Galu, Shambo had problems fitting in with the"
15,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,rest of her tribe. >> Galu is like they're in high
16,00:00:34.38,00:00:34.38,school. The young people want to lay on
17,00:00:36.75,00:00:36.75,the beach and gossip. >> PROBST: She broke their
18,00:00:39.46,00:00:39.46,fishing gear. >> It's in the swamp.
19,00:00:41.17,00:00:41.17,There's nothing I can do. >> PROBST: And lost one of
20,00:00:43.12,00:00:43.12,their chickens. >> Shambo is a complete
21,00:00:45.21,00:00:45.21,Gilligan who messes just things up all the time.
22,00:00:48.12,00:00:48.12,>> PROBST: Shambo's best friends are on Foa Foa who she
23,00:00:50.21,00:00:50.21,bonded with when she visited their camp.
24,00:00:52.17,00:00:52.17,>> There was a huge appreciation for Shambo.
25,00:00:54.33,00:00:54.33,">> PROBST: One, two, three, four, five."
26,00:00:57.71,00:00:57.71,Foa Foa wins their first immunity challenge!
27,00:01:00.92,00:01:00.92,"When Galu finally lost an immunity challenge, Russell"
28,00:01:03.42,00:01:03.42,wanted to take out Monica. But most of the others wanted
29,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83,Yasmin to go home. >> She does the least out of
30,00:01:14.17,00:01:14.17,"everyone here. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
31,00:01:16.21,00:01:16.21,Russell reluctantly sided with the majority.
32,00:01:18.62,00:01:18.62,>> I'm sorry. >> PROBST: Yasmin was gone.
33,00:01:23.25,00:01:23.25,"And by voting for Monica, Shambo further alienated"
34,00:01:27.17,00:01:27.17,herself from her tribe. 15 are left.
35,00:01:32.12,00:01:32.12,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Everybody go left behind me.
36,00:01:42.50,00:01:42.50,And then we'll be in front of the fire in a minute.
37,00:01:45.17,00:01:45.17,"Well, we just got back from our first Tribal Council, and"
38,00:01:48.12,00:01:48.12,"Yasmin got voted out. I didn't expect it, not by a"
39,00:01:51.75,00:01:51.75,"long shot. >> Do we have any flame there,"
40,00:01:54.04,00:01:54.04,Shambo? >> I haven't gotten to the
41,00:01:56.08,00:01:56.08,"pot yet. I'm doing that right now,"
42,00:01:57.62,00:01:57.62,darling. We do.
43,00:01:58.92,00:01:58.92,">> Okay, perfect. >> Let me get this pot out of"
44,00:02:01.08,00:02:01.08,the way so nobody gets hurt on it.
45,00:02:03.08,00:02:03.08,I'm a little disparaged about the fact that every single
46,00:02:06.08,00:02:06.08,"person on our team was in alignment, with the exception"
47,00:02:10.83,00:02:10.83,of myself. I'm absolutely exhausted and
48,00:02:13.96,00:02:13.96,hopefully I'll get some good sleep tonight and pick up the
49,00:02:17.25,00:02:17.25,pieces tomorrow. So it's like...
50,00:02:30.00,00:02:30.00,Whereas we can just sit here and just chill and not do
51,00:02:32.42,00:02:32.42,anything about it. >> So Tribal was pretty crazy.
52,00:02:37.17,00:02:37.17,Now in retrospect I realize that Shambo is the only person
53,00:02:40.46,00:02:40.46,"here who voted against me, so that kind of hangs over my head"
54,00:02:43.58,00:02:43.58,"a little bit, and so I definitely want to continue and"
55,00:02:47.12,00:02:47.12,take Sham off. She's my next choice.

57,00:04:26.04,00:04:26.04,">> This ocean is a real bitch. When, you know, you try to go"
58,00:04:33.17,00:04:33.17,"out there, it hits with you massive tides and waves that"
59,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,suck you and pull you and send you all over the place.
60,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,"I've never seen an object, inanimate, or animate, that was"
61,00:04:42.83,00:04:42.83,as angry and fickle as this ocean.
62,00:04:59.96,00:04:59.96,>> The ocean is not playing around right now.
63,00:05:03.25,00:05:03.25,">> Oh, my God. Like, is there a hurricane out"
64,00:05:05.88,00:05:05.88,"there? >> It's day 12, and we finally"
65,00:05:08.08,00:05:08.08,came off a win. We're still excited.
66,00:05:10.58,00:05:10.58,The sun's shining. The ocean's been crazy.
67,00:05:12.17,00:05:12.17,>> What if our flag washed away. >> But seems like maybe it's a
68,00:05:15.38,00:05:15.38,bright day for Foa Foa. >> Tree mail.
69,00:05:18.21,00:05:18.21,>> Tree mail. >> You guys ready?
70,00:05:20.25,00:05:20.25,">> Ready. >> ""The ocean's deep provide"
71,00:05:22.46,00:05:22.46,many a treat. Some pay a fortune for what you
72,00:05:24.42,00:05:24.42,will eat. If you keep it all down inside
73,00:05:28.00,00:05:28.00,"your tummy, you just may win something yummy."""
74,00:05:30.33,00:05:30.33,">> No! >> Oh, no, it's a food"
75,00:05:32.21,00:05:32.21,"challenge. >> Oh, no!"
76,00:05:34.25,00:05:34.25,"We're going to have to eat gross, like, stuff from the"
77,00:05:37.17,00:05:37.17,"ocean. >> Oh, my God!"
78,00:05:39.46,00:05:39.46,">> What do you mean gross stuff, like fish?"
79,00:05:41.17,00:05:41.17,>> Just do it. >> No!
80,00:05:43.00,00:05:43.00,>> It's gonna be nasty stuff. >> No it will be like
81,00:05:46.00,00:05:46.00,"Samoan rat. >> The trick is, you can't"
82,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,throw it up. You have to keep it down.
83,00:05:50.17,00:05:50.17,You cannot puke. >> I know.
84,00:05:51.50,00:05:51.50,>> I'm actually really excited about our reward challenge.
85,00:05:52.75,00:05:52.75,I'm a pretty experimental eater. I'll try everything once.
86,00:05:55.21,00:05:55.21,So hopefully this comes to my advantage and hopefully I am
87,00:06:00.17,00:06:00.17,one of the stronger people on my tribe today.
88,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,>> Why? >> You said it was going to be
89,00:06:12.96,00:06:12.96,"a hard time for you, didn't you? >> No, I said I'd eat it."
90,00:06:15.38,00:06:15.38,"I'd just be grossed out. >> I was about to say, ""You done"
91,00:06:40.58,00:06:40.58,with this? You trying to put her on some
92,00:06:42.71,00:06:42.71,"kind of chopping block? You want me to just watch her,"
93,00:06:45.08,00:06:45.08,just watch her individual eating challenge?
94,00:06:47.88,00:06:47.88,">> Right. I know, she's always spreading"
95,00:06:51.46,00:06:51.46,"little... >> Yeah, she's trying to spread"
96,00:06:53.79,00:06:53.79,little seeds to grow in people's heads.
97,00:06:55.75,00:06:55.75,She should just shut up about it.
98,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,Liz could be dangerous for me if she's able to manipulate
99,00:07:01.88,00:07:01.88,other to go her way instead of my way.
100,00:07:05.54,00:07:05.54,So as soon as I see somebody playing that mind game on other
101,00:07:09.08,00:07:09.08,"people, they're a huge threat because that's what this game"
102,00:07:12.04,00:07:12.04,"is all about is mind games, and I've gotta be the only mind"
103,00:07:15.92,00:07:15.92,"game player here. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
104,00:07:37.25,00:07:37.25,"Foa Foa, getting your first look at the new Galu tribe."
105,00:07:41.21,00:07:41.21,Yasmin voted out at the last Tribal Council.
106,00:07:45.25,00:07:45.25,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
107,00:07:48.25,00:07:48.25,">> Yup. >> Oh, yeah."
108,00:07:49.46,00:07:49.46,">> PROBST: If there is one thing I am sure of, it is"
109,00:07:51.67,00:07:51.67,this-- you are all hungry. >> Yes.
110,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: The good news is,"
111,00:07:55.62,00:07:55.62,today you will eat. I'll spin the wheel.
112,00:07:58.75,00:07:58.75,One member of each tribe will roll a ball.
113,00:08:01.25,00:08:01.25,The ball will land on different ingredients.
114,00:08:03.25,00:08:03.25,I will then blend those ingredients to make a Samoa
115,00:08:06.79,00:08:06.79,smoothie. And you will then gulp it down.
116,00:08:10.08,00:08:10.08,"Each time you get it down, you score a point for your tribe."
117,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,"It's not a race. If you get it down, you score a"
118,00:08:16.04,00:08:16.04,point. First tribe to five wins reward.
119,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,Want to know what you're playing for?
120,00:08:21.12,00:08:21.12,>> Yes. >> Yes.
121,00:08:22.33,00:08:22.33,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: If you can get the"
122,00:08:24.17,00:08:24.17,bad stuff down you get the good stuff.
123,00:08:26.88,00:08:26.88,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Survivor barbecue.
124,00:08:34.12,00:08:34.12,All you have to do is get the smoothie down.
125,00:08:36.71,00:08:36.71,>> Drink it. I don't care what it tastes
126,00:08:38.62,00:08:38.62,"like. >> PROBST: In addition, the"
127,00:08:41.08,00:08:41.08,winning tribe will send one of its members over to the losing
128,00:08:43.92,00:08:43.92,"tribe for a little spy expedition, which means that"
129,00:08:48.29,00:08:48.29,person will miss out on the reward.
130,00:08:51.33,00:08:51.33,Worth playing for? >> Yes!
131,00:08:53.12,00:08:53.12,">> PROBST: All right, Galu, you're sitting out three people"
132,00:08:55.46,00:08:55.46,"this challenge. Keep in mind, you cannot sit"
133,00:08:58.00,00:08:58.00,out the same people in back-to-back challenges.
134,00:09:00.29,00:09:00.29,"Who's it going to be Russell? >> It's going to be Kelly,"
135,00:09:02.67,00:09:02.67,"Laura, and John. >> PROBST: Kelly, Laura, John,"
136,00:09:06.25,00:09:06.25,take a spot on the bench. Everybody else take a spot on
137,00:09:08.71,00:09:08.71,"your benches, and we will get started."
138,00:09:13.46,00:09:13.46,"All right, first two. Shambo for Galu taking on"
139,00:09:17.58,00:09:17.58,Jaison. What ingredients will we have
140,00:09:22.29,00:09:22.29,"in our first smoothie? Oh, I like this one."
141,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,I like it. We have giant clam and we have
142,00:09:29.54,00:09:29.54,Jeff's choice. >> Sweet.
143,00:09:31.75,00:09:31.75,>> PROBST: First the giant clam. >> Yummy.
144,00:09:37.17,00:09:37.17,>> PROBST: That looks pretty good.
145,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,Jeff's choice means I get to add whatever I'd like.
146,00:09:43.04,00:09:43.04,And the flies seem to really like the octopus.
147,00:09:45.58,00:09:45.58,>> All right! >> PROBST: Let's see what else
148,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,we can have. How about a sea snail or two.
149,00:09:52.04,00:09:52.04,>> Really? >> PROBST: And I'm gonna
150,00:09:54.17,00:09:54.17,"give you a little noni juice. >> You got this, Jaison, no"
151,00:09:59.50,00:09:59.50,worries. >> Think of the steaks.
152,00:10:02.25,00:10:02.25,">> PROBST: Add a little garnish, fresh seaweed."
153,00:10:05.04,00:10:05.04,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Cheers.
154,00:10:07.21,00:10:07.21,">> Cheers. >> Get it, Sham."

170,00:10:55.12,00:10:55.12,It's a jellyfish special. Let me just get in here and get
171,00:10:58.00,00:10:58.00,some good helping of jellyfish. >> All right!
172,00:10:59.75,00:10:59.75,">> Oh, yeah. >> Yummy!"

341,00:19:09.25,00:19:09.25,make her feel better about it. I hope I can pick you up and...

379,00:21:02.12,00:21:02.12,>> I got to hear it from the chief.
380,00:21:04.17,00:21:04.17,">> No, you don't. You're a grown ass man."
381,00:21:10.33,00:21:10.33,">> Man, I'm not even trying to be arrogant."
382,00:21:12.62,00:21:12.62,It's just that I sometimes patronize people without
383,00:21:15.33,00:21:15.33,"thinking about it, but I'm afraid that I'm going to shoot"
384,00:21:19.17,00:21:19.17,myself in the foot without knowing what's happening.
385,00:21:24.62,00:21:24.62,"Hey, Chief, I'm sorry about being a jerk, dude."
386,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,>> Don't worry about it. >> All right. Shake?
387,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,">> It's all good, man. >> All right."
388,00:21:33.62,00:21:33.62,">> I'd love to. >> All right, good."
389,00:21:35.71,00:21:35.71,">> Oh. >> Build that thing up, Dave."
390,00:21:38.83,00:21:38.83,"Come on. >> Ow! Whooey, that's hot."
391,00:21:41.92,00:21:41.92,"Get down. >> Good job, guys!"
392,00:21:43.92,00:21:43.92,>> Dave's the man! >> Dave did it.
393,00:21:46.04,00:21:46.04,">> Dave, that's awesome! >> Apparently, nobody here knows"
394,00:21:49.42,00:21:49.42,"how to make fire but me, which to me is, like, really?"
395,00:21:52.04,00:21:52.04,">> All right, so what are we doing?"
396,00:21:54.12,00:21:54.12,What are we doing? What are we doing?
397,00:21:56.29,00:21:56.29,">> But I'm trying to downplay my awesomeness, 'cause it speaks"
398,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,"for itself. Actions speak louder than words,"
399,00:22:01.04,00:22:01.04,"so I don't need to say anything. >> Oh, my gosh, that looks so"
400,00:22:04.54,00:22:04.54,"good. >> Oh, my God."
401,00:22:07.42,00:22:07.42,(laughter) (whooping)
402,00:22:10.75,00:22:10.75,">> You know, hey, if I'm the only guy here that can make"
403,00:22:14.08,00:22:14.08,"fire, makes me pretty valuable. >> They are in trouble."
404,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,"I could take the whole... After I finish this, I could"
405,00:22:23.25,00:22:23.25,take the whole team by myself. (birds singing)
406,00:22:29.08,00:22:29.08,">> Hey, you guys, I'm going to share the clues with you to the"
407,00:22:31.79,00:22:31.79,hidden immunity idol. >> Nice.
408,00:22:33.79,00:22:33.79,>> 'Cause you're more of a damn tribe to me than my tribe is.
409,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,"(laughter) The third clue is, ""Turn your"
410,00:22:39.42,00:22:39.42,"gaze downward, scour the earth and take heed."
411,00:22:44.12,00:22:44.12,"Inside the hole of the tree is the idol you need."""
412,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,Which is this tree right here. >> By the fire.
413,00:22:52.46,00:22:52.46,Shambo-- she's still looking for the immunity idol.
414,00:22:58.25,00:22:58.25,>> But she will never find it. (Russell laughs)
415,00:23:00.38,00:23:00.38,It's in my pocket. So that's funny.
416,00:23:02.38,00:23:02.38,">> Jaison, do you have the hidden immunity idol?"
417,00:23:08.25,00:23:08.25,">> No, I don't have it. Would I tell you if I had it?"
418,00:23:10.88,00:23:10.88,>> I hope so. >> I know damn well Ben got
419,00:23:13.17,00:23:13.17,"kicked out with that freaking idol, idiot."
420,00:23:15.88,00:23:15.88,">> Oh, I agree. >> I know he did."
421,00:23:18.12,00:23:18.12,">> But he didn't play it, so... >> I know."
422,00:23:20.21,00:23:20.21,">> The immunity idol was never played, even if Ben had it."
423,00:23:23.25,00:23:23.25,"I mean, I know somebody has it, and I have a feeling, if it"
424,00:23:26.42,00:23:26.42,"wasn't Ben, it's Russell, and I have a feeling it's probably"
425,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83,"Russell. >> Yeah, I've been in that tree"
426,00:23:34.75,00:23:34.75,"a lot, but not all the way up in it. Where is it?"
427,00:23:37.12,00:23:37.12,>> You don't have to go all the way up in it.
428,00:23:39.12,00:23:39.12,She didn't stand up in it. I'm telling you.
429,00:23:41.12,00:23:41.12,You are lying to me. >> Why is this so much of a
430,00:23:43.21,00:23:43.21,concern for you? >> Because I want...
431,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,>> Why are you so worried about this?
432,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,>> Because I feel like you should be honest.
433,00:23:48.96,00:23:48.96,">> You're freaking me out right now, 'cause I'm telling you the"
434,00:23:50.67,00:23:50.67,"truth, and you're telling me I'm not honest."
435,00:23:52.79,00:23:52.79,>> Well... >> You want to be the one who
436,00:23:54.38,00:23:54.38,goes next? You're throwing all kind of
437,00:23:56.25,00:23:56.25,"stupid stuff around. Liz, she gets it."
438,00:23:58.08,00:23:58.08,She knows what's going on. But why in the world would you
439,00:24:00.17,00:24:00.17,threaten me? That's like slapping me in the
440,00:24:02.17,00:24:02.17,face. You don't think I'm going to
441,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,"get back at you? Girl, you're walking on that"
442,00:24:06.17,00:24:06.17,thin ice. >> Ben... Ben told me...
443,00:24:08.17,00:24:08.17,>> I'm going to tell you that right now.
444,00:24:10.08,00:24:10.08,"Let me tell you. You're walking on thin ice,"
445,00:24:12.17,00:24:12.17,"period. >> Oh, God."
446,00:24:34.21,00:24:34.21,"There's been a lot of rain tonight, like torrential"
447,00:24:37.21,00:24:37.21,"downpour, and it's freezing. Now all our blankets are wet."
448,00:24:41.17,00:24:41.17,I'm actually regretting the decision to choose blankets
449,00:24:44.08,00:24:44.08,instead of the tarp right now. This is the hardest night yet.
450,00:24:47.62,00:24:47.62,It's bad. (bird singing)
451,00:25:14.25,00:25:14.25,">> Come on, boys. Right there."

457,00:25:35.50,00:25:35.50,you'll have to kick some butts. Not worried about going home
458,00:25:38.46,00:25:38.46,"tonight? Then you must be plain nuts."""
459,00:25:52.12,00:25:52.12,">> For the past 24 hours, I haven't really thought about"
460,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,the game. I've just been trying to focus
461,00:25:57.00,00:25:57.00,"on, uh, staying dry, but, you know, today is a huge challenge."
462,00:26:00.25,00:26:00.25,It's the first immunity challenge after we lost the
463,00:26:03.25,00:26:03.25,"last immunity challenge, so we really want to reclaim this and"
464,00:26:06.08,00:26:06.08,keep up our advantage. So I'm hoping people will
465,00:26:09.21,00:26:09.21,forget about their discomfort and just hit it hard today.
466,00:26:20.08,00:26:20.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! All right, Shambo, you can"

469,00:26:41.38,00:26:41.38,acknowledged you coming back. >> It's a game.
470,00:26:43.38,00:26:43.38,"I wouldn't take it personally. It's raining, and everyone's"
471,00:26:46.21,00:26:46.21,"trying to stay warm. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
472,00:26:48.25,00:26:48.25,ready to get to today's challenge?
473,00:26:50.29,00:26:50.29,>> Yup. >> Yup.

477,00:26:58.33,00:26:58.33,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.

482,00:27:15.08,00:27:15.08,that net. The more coconuts go into the
483,00:27:18.00,00:27:18.00,"net, the heavier the net becomes until you can no longer hold on."
484,00:27:22.08,00:27:22.08,The tribe member who holds on to their net the longest wins
485,00:27:25.62,00:27:25.62,immunity for their tribe. Losers go to Tribal Council
486,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,where somebody will be voted out of this game.
487,00:27:32.71,00:27:32.71,"Galu, you have three extra members."
488,00:27:34.75,00:27:34.75,You're sitting three people out. You cannot sit out the same

498,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,We'll get started. All right.
499,00:28:01.58,00:28:01.58,"Holding the ropes for Foa Foa, it is Liz and Russell."
500,00:28:06.21,00:28:06.21,"For Galu, it's Russell and Laura."

566,00:31:10.92,00:31:10.92,Nobody else going home from Galu.
567,00:31:13.96,00:31:13.96,"Russell, Liz, Jaison, Ashley, Mick, Natalie, after 14 days,"
568,00:31:19.75,00:31:19.75,one of you will be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council.
569,00:31:22.29,00:31:22.29,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
570,00:31:24.38,00:31:24.38,I will see you at Tribal. (rolling thunder)
571,00:31:44.29,00:31:44.29,(rolling thunder) >> Today is the first day I'm
572,00:31:52.88,00:31:52.88,convinced that we might be at a real serious disadvantage.
573,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,"You know, it just doesn't... As a tribe, it doesn't look"
574,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,"good anymore. >> Oh, I'm sorry."
575,00:32:02.12,00:32:02.12,">> It's okay. >> I'm sorry, sweetie."
576,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,>> It's okay. >> Our shelter's got rain in it.
577,00:32:07.21,00:32:07.21,None of us slept last night. We're all cold.
578,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,We're all tired. Our hands and feet look like
579,00:32:12.29,00:32:12.29,crap. This is absolute misery.
580,00:32:15.00,00:32:15.00,"I have never in my life been this cold, had my hands this"
581,00:32:17.96,00:32:17.96,"destroyed, and my feet look so miserable in my life."
582,00:32:20.62,00:32:20.62,There's nothing I want to do more right now than to get out
583,00:32:22.62,00:32:22.62,"of here. (loud, rumbling thunderclaps)"
584,00:33:00.58,00:33:00.58,>> No. >> I know I don't want to go.
585,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,">> Normally, before Tribal Council, we all get to run"
586,00:33:12.79,00:33:12.79,"around and scramble, trying to figure out strategy, but"
587,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,"today... I mean, we're all cooped up in a"
588,00:33:18.04,00:33:18.04,shelter right now. We... I can't do much about it
589,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,without other people hearing. It's either we all just vote
590,00:33:25.42,00:33:25.42,"for whoever we think, and everyone just pack your bags, or"
591,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50,we talk about it and figure it out so the person knows who's
592,00:33:31.62,00:33:31.62,going home. >> It will be an interesting
593,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,Tribal. I have no idea what everyone
594,00:33:43.58,00:33:43.58,else is going to do. I'm going to vote for Liz.
595,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,I haven't really had a trust with her since day one.
596,00:33:49.33,00:33:49.33,I always thought there was something weird going on with
597,00:33:51.79,00:33:51.79,"her, so I just don't trust her. >> I think Ashley should go."
598,00:33:59.54,00:33:59.54,"She, to me, is the physical weakest link."
599,00:34:02.00,00:34:02.00,I just don't think she pulled her weight in the challenges.
600,00:34:07.62,00:34:07.62,>> We got to send somebody home tonight.
601,00:34:09.96,00:34:09.96,"Because the guys are pretty tight-- possibly Liz, possibly,"
602,00:34:12.12,00:34:12.12,"uh, Ashley, um, or Natalie. I'll play it by ear."
603,00:34:19.88,00:34:19.88,">> We're all stuck in the shelter, confined in a little"
604,00:34:23.04,00:34:23.04,"ball, so I don't know what everybody's decision is going"
605,00:34:27.00,00:34:27.00,"to be, but I think it's going to be one of us girls, for sure."
606,00:34:34.29,00:34:34.29,>> I have absolutely no idea what's going to go down with
607,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,this vote. My mentality right now is just
608,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,to go into Tribal Council and see what happens.
609,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,>> It bums me out that I had to stop my strategy because of the
610,00:34:50.54,00:34:50.54,rain. That's not playing the game like
611,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,I would regularly play it. (thunder crashing)
612,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,"Liz asked me if I had the immunity idol, and she just"
613,00:35:03.58,00:35:03.58,keeps telling me that she don't trust me.
614,00:35:06.21,00:35:06.21,"You know, when you come at me like that, and you tell me you"
615,00:35:09.46,00:35:09.46,"don't trust me, it puts a target on your back."
616,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,But Liz is stronger than Ashley. So I-I don't really know which
617,00:35:17.21,00:35:17.21,"way I'm going to go tonight. >> PROBST: Jaison, finish this"
618,00:35:44.29,00:35:44.29,"sentence for me. ""Until Survivor, the toughest"
619,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,"thing I'd ever gone through was..."""
620,00:35:48.08,00:35:48.08,">> If I had to make a comparison, there was, uh, you"
621,00:35:50.17,00:35:50.17,"know, when I was playing on the U.S.A. National team..."
622,00:35:53.25,00:35:53.25,">> PROBST: In what sport? >> Uh, in water polo."
623,00:35:55.88,00:35:55.88,We had this Yugoslavian coach who believed that our body
624,00:35:58.83,00:35:58.83,"needed to be in crisis at all times, so we're jumping in the"
625,00:36:00.92,00:36:00.92,"pool and wrestling with another guy, then jumping out and doing"
626,00:36:03.42,00:36:03.42,"circuits of just beating up on each other, for eight, nine"
627,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"hours a day, seven days a week. So, I came in here thinking that"
628,00:36:10.08,00:36:10.08,this wasn't going to be that big a deal because I had done a lot
629,00:36:12.83,00:36:12.83,"of training and done a lot of things I thought were hard, but"
630,00:36:15.42,00:36:15.42,this is by far the hardest thing I've ever done.
631,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,">> PROBST: Ashley, I'm guessing coming to Tribal was almost"
632,00:36:20.25,00:36:20.25,"welcome, simply because there is a warm fire here and cover from"
633,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,"the rain. >> Yeah, that's true, because"
634,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,we're all so cold. Our clothes are drenched.
635,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"I mean, it sucks sending someone home, but at the same"
636,00:36:31.17,00:36:31.17,"time, hey, at least there's going to be a fire tonight."
637,00:36:34.04,00:36:34.04,">> And the fact that we're also, like, stuck under this little"
638,00:36:37.75,00:36:37.75,"shelter and it's pouring rain. I mean, it's pretty tough to"
639,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,"scramble, you know, when we're all sitting there watching each"
640,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,other. You can only be so subtle.
641,00:36:44.21,00:36:44.21,"What, are you gonna pull somebody out in the rain?"
642,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,"They'd be like, ""Hell, no, I'm not going with you."
643,00:36:47.67,00:36:47.67,It's freezing out there. Are you mad?
644,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,"You're going home, man, that's it."""
645,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,">> PROBST: Natalie, that's got to be a little uncomfortable,"
646,00:36:54.17,00:36:54.17,"knowing that maybe they decided, ""You know what?"
647,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,"The girl in the yellow dress-- I guess I'm gonna vote for her."""
648,00:36:59.21,00:36:59.21,>> That's true. There was no way to try and
649,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,"strategize. Literally we're, like, purple."
650,00:37:05.12,00:37:05.12,"Before, it was always a scramble, so I think the weather"
651,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"had a lot to do with it today. >> PROBST: Russell, does the"
652,00:37:11.96,00:37:11.96,criteria for voting begin to change when you look at what
653,00:37:15.88,00:37:15.88,you've been through and what you might have to go through?
654,00:37:18.25,00:37:18.25,Does suddenly competition at challenges give way to: who do I
655,00:37:22.71,00:37:22.71,really like being around or who can I trust?
656,00:37:25.92,00:37:25.92,">> Yeah, I think it does. We are down to five people now,"
657,00:37:29.38,00:37:29.38,"and I think to me, it depends on who you can trust."
658,00:37:32.71,00:37:32.71,That's like gold in this game. But the fact of the matter is: I
659,00:37:36.71,00:37:36.71,really trust the people around me right now.
660,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,>> PROBST: So that's the problem.
661,00:37:40.96,00:37:40.96,>> And that's the problem. Right.
662,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,">> PROBST: Ashley, Russell talks about trusting everybody at this"
663,00:37:46.08,00:37:46.08,point. Who do you trust in this tribe?
664,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,">> I trust everyone to a certain extent, but I think my biggest"
665,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,trust lies in Natalie and Russell.
666,00:37:55.79,00:37:55.79,>> PROBST: What is it about Russell you trust?
667,00:37:57.96,00:37:57.96,">> From the get-go, he's kind of pulled me under his wing a"
668,00:38:01.33,00:38:01.33,"little bit. I don't know, I just feel like I"
669,00:38:03.42,00:38:03.42,"can talk to him. So, from the get-go, that's why"
670,00:38:05.96,00:38:05.96,we have had-- kind of had a different connection.
671,00:38:08.58,00:38:08.58,">> PROBST: Liz, who do you trust?"
672,00:38:11.04,00:38:11.04,>> I trust pretty much everyone here.
673,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,I think in going through three Tribal Councils and enduring all
674,00:38:16.25,00:38:16.25,"the losses that we've had to endure, it's brought us much"
675,00:38:19.38,00:38:19.38,more closer together than I ever would have anticipated and I am
676,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,"surprised that I would place so much trust in these guys, but I"
677,00:38:26.38,00:38:26.38,do. >> PROBST: So you'd be shocked
678,00:38:28.42,00:38:28.42,"if it was you tonight? >> I would be surprised, but"
679,00:38:30.71,00:38:30.71,"it's my gut that would tell me, and, you know, that's not an"
680,00:38:34.17,00:38:34.17,"issue about trust. >> PROBST: Mick, how will this"
681,00:38:37.21,00:38:37.21,tribe be better when they go back to camp tonight?
682,00:38:40.92,00:38:40.92,">> In the long haul, maybe we'll be a little more organized."
683,00:38:44.25,00:38:44.25,Maybe we'll be a little bit stronger at challenges.
684,00:38:46.50,00:38:46.50,"You know, eventually I think that will strengthen us."
685,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,">> PROBST: Jaison, you agree with that?"
686,00:38:52.21,00:38:52.21,">> I think so. I mean, depending on who leaves,"
687,00:38:53.71,00:38:53.71,we could be a stronger team physically.
688,00:38:55.62,00:38:55.62,We could end up being a weaker team because somebody is hurt
689,00:38:58.96,00:38:58.96,that their person went and they didn't think they were supposed
690,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,"to. >> PROBST: Russell, do you like"
691,00:39:04.75,00:39:04.75,the feeling as we get ready to vote?
692,00:39:07.04,00:39:07.04,It's so up in the air. It's a wild card.
693,00:39:09.21,00:39:09.21,Who knows what everybody else is going to do?
694,00:39:11.25,00:39:11.25,">> Yeah, it doesn't make sense and that's not how you play the"
695,00:39:14.38,00:39:14.38,"game, but with this group, I think we're just too tight, so I"
696,00:39:19.29,00:39:19.29,don't really think it's up in the air.
697,00:39:22.21,00:39:22.21,>> PROBST: We'll find out if you're right.
698,00:39:25.04,00:39:25.04,">> Let's do it. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
699,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,"to vote. Mick, you're up."
700,00:39:44.54,00:39:44.54,>> I trust you the least out of everyone.
701,00:39:59.96,00:39:59.96,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
702,00:40:08.67,00:40:08.67,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
703,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
704,00:40:14.00,00:40:14.00,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
705,00:40:18.12,00:40:18.12,First vote-- Ashley. Liz.
706,00:40:30.17,00:40:30.17,"Ashley. Two votes-- Ashley, one vote--"
707,00:40:32.08,00:40:32.08,Liz. Ashley.
708,00:40:37.46,00:40:37.46,"That's three votes-- Ashley, one vote-- Liz."
709,00:40:42.58,00:40:42.58,Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa-- Ashley.
710,00:40:46.46,00:40:46.46,"That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
711,00:40:57.25,00:40:57.25,"Ashley, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
712,00:41:04.04,00:41:04.04,">> Kick some butt, you guys. >> PROBST: Well, you're now down"
713,00:41:14.21,00:41:14.21,to five members. The question is: can you dig
714,00:41:18.08,00:41:18.08,deep enough to do what needs to be done to turn this game
715,00:41:21.08,00:41:21.08,around? Grab your torches.
716,00:41:23.08,00:41:23.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
717,00:41:40.04,00:41:40.04,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
718,00:41:47.12,00:41:47.12,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor.
719,00:41:49.12,00:41:49.12,The storms continue to batter both tribes.
720,00:41:51.38,00:41:51.38,">> The elements out here-- like, it's going to break you down."
721,00:41:53.38,00:41:53.38,"(Jaison laughs, thunder cracks) >> PROBST: And another castaway"
722,00:41:58.29,00:41:58.29,"goes down. Hold up, hold up, hold up."
723,00:42:00.75,00:42:00.75,"Everybody, hold up. Medical!"
724,00:42:03.88,00:42:03.88,Hold where you are. >> Survivor was the hardest
725,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,"thing I've ever done in my entire life, but it was the best"
726,00:42:14.50,00:42:14.50,experience. I have learned so much about
727,00:42:16.42,00:42:16.42,myself. I am such a high-maintenance
728,00:42:18.67,00:42:18.67,girl at home. I never thought in a million
729,00:42:20.83,00:42:20.83,years that I would be able to go through the things that I've
730,00:42:23.25,00:42:23.25,gone through here. I wish that my tribe would beat
731,00:42:25.79,00:42:25.79,"Galu and take some wins, and hopefully one of them can win"
732,00:42:29.29,00:42:29.29,the million dollars.
