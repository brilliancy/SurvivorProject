1072,00:32:16.77,00:32:16.77,I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MANY
1073,00:32:18.30,00:32:18.30,PEOPLE SCREWED YOU IN THE PAST
1074,00:32:19.63,00:32:19.63,TWO GAMES YOU PLAYED.
1075,00:32:20.43,00:32:20.43,BECAUSE BOTH GAMES I WAS--
1076,00:32:22.17,00:32:22.17,BOTH GAMES--
1077,00:32:23.13,00:32:23.13,I'M JUST GIVING YOU AN
1078,00:32:24.97,00:32:24.97,EXAMPLE.
1079,00:32:25.63,00:32:25.63,BECAUSE BOTH GAMES I HAD MY
1080,00:32:26.80,00:32:26.80,HEAD IN THE SAND AND I WASN'T
1081,00:32:28.80,00:32:28.80,PLAYING THE GAME.
1082,00:32:30.07,00:32:30.07,I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IN THE
1083,00:32:31.93,00:32:31.93,GAME AND READ PEOPLE AND I TEND
1084,00:32:33.53,00:32:33.53,TO BE A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.
1085,00:32:37.10,00:32:37.10,"YOU OKAY, SOPHIE?"
1086,00:32:38.23,00:32:38.23,YEAH.
1087,00:32:39.80,00:32:39.80,I THOUGHT I HAD A FIVE STRONG
1088,00:32:41.97,00:32:41.97,PLUS EDNA ALLIANCE GOING.
1089,00:32:43.57,00:32:43.57,AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO
1090,00:32:45.23,00:32:45.23,HAVE TO DO SOME RESHUFFLING ONLY
1091,00:32:47.13,00:32:47.13,BECAUSE OUR ALLIANCE IS BASED ON
1092,00:32:48.90,00:32:48.90,"TRUST, AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE"
1093,00:32:50.33,00:32:50.33,"IN IT DOESN'T MEAN, YOU KNOW,"
1094,00:32:52.10,00:32:52.10,WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO TRUST YOU.
1095,00:32:53.67,00:32:53.67,WE'LL TRUST YOU UNTIL YOU DO
1096,00:32:55.07,00:32:55.07,SOMETHING WRONG AND RIGHT NOW IT
1097,00:32:56.77,00:32:56.77,LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKE BRANDON
1098,00:32:58.83,00:32:58.83,"IS A SMALL, SMALL RESULTS HANTZ."
1099,00:33:01.77,00:33:01.77,I THINK THAT BRANDON IS A
1100,00:33:03.13,00:33:03.13,"GREAT GUY, AND I WANT TO BE WITH"
1101,00:33:05.10,00:33:05.10,"BRANDON EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,"
1102,00:33:07.40,00:33:07.40,BUT I'M WORRIED HE IS GOING TO
1103,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,KICK OVER THE KETTLE AT THE MOST
1104,00:33:11.27,00:33:11.27,INOPPORTUNE TIME AND RUIN THE
1105,00:33:12.37,00:33:12.37,"GAME FOR EVERYBODY, AND THAT'S"
1106,00:33:13.47,00:33:13.47,WHY I HAVE TO ALSO PROTECT
1107,00:33:15.30,00:33:15.30,MYSELF.
1108,00:33:16.03,00:33:16.03,I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT I'M OUT
1109,00:33:16.97,00:33:16.97,HERE FOR THE THIRD AND POSSIBLY
1110,00:33:19.27,00:33:19.27,FINAL TIME AND THIS HAS GOT TO
1111,00:33:21.03,00:33:21.03,"BE MY GAME, AND I CAN'T LET"
1112,00:33:23.57,00:33:23.57,ANYBODY OR ANYTHING MESS IT UP.
1113,00:33:27.47,00:33:27.47,Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1117,00:33:33.07,00:33:33.07,TWO WOMEN WHO REALLY DUKED IT
1118,00:33:35.60,00:33:35.60,OUT.
1119,00:33:36.47,00:33:36.47,"STACEY, WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED?"
1120,00:33:37.50,00:33:37.50,"I MEAN, YOU SAW ME ON MY"
1121,00:33:39.43,00:33:39.43,BACK.
1122,00:33:40.10,00:33:40.10,"I WAS ON MY KNEES, ONE ARM."
1123,00:33:41.37,00:33:41.37,"AND I HELD ON, HARD AS I COULD,"
1124,00:33:43.83,00:33:43.83,"BUT I KNOW I WAS STRONG, AND I"
1125,00:33:46.03,00:33:46.03,DID A VERY GOOD JOB DURING THE
1126,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,TIME.
1127,00:33:49.07,00:33:49.07,"Jeff: COACH, IT'S GOOD"
1128,00:33:51.20,00:33:51.20,NEWS/BAD NEWS TO BE PERSON WHO
1129,00:33:51.97,00:33:51.97,CAN BE THE HERO OR THE GOAT.
1130,00:33:54.63,00:33:54.63,YOU CAN ARGUE STACEY GAVE A HELL
1131,00:33:55.77,00:33:55.77,OF AN EFFORT.
1132,00:33:56.47,00:33:56.47,YOU CAN ALSO OFFER STACEY LOST
1133,00:33:58.07,00:33:58.07,IT DAWN.
1134,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,"YOU KNOW, I THINK IF WE WERE"
1135,00:33:59.90,00:33:59.90,TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO
1136,00:34:01.40,00:34:01.40,PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON THEIR
1137,00:34:04.43,00:34:04.43,"WARRIOR SPIRIT, WOULD I SAY THAT"
1138,00:34:06.07,00:34:06.07,STACEY WAS ON THE FENCE TODAY?
1139,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,NO.
1140,00:34:08.77,00:34:08.77,WE ALL TAKE OUR HATS OFF TO HER
1141,00:34:10.90,00:34:10.90,FOR HOW SHE PERFORMED IN THE
1142,00:34:12.60,00:34:12.60,CHALLENGE TODAY.
1143,00:34:13.20,00:34:13.20,Jeff: ONE OF THE THINGS
1144,00:34:14.10,00:34:14.10,THIS TRIBE HAS SAID FROM DAY ONE
1145,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,IS WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO KEEP
1146,00:34:17.53,00:34:17.53,THE TRIBE STRONG.
1147,00:34:18.43,00:34:18.43,EVERYBODY HERE AGREE WITH THAT?
1148,00:34:19.80,00:34:19.80,YEAH.
1149,00:34:20.37,00:34:20.37,"Jeff: SO, SOPHIE, HOW IS"

1151,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33,THIS TRIBE?
1152,00:34:26.00,00:34:26.00,I THINK YOU LOOK AT STRENGTH
1153,00:34:28.63,00:34:28.63,AS IN STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AS
1154,00:34:30.13,00:34:30.13,WELL AS PHYSICAL STRENGTH
1155,00:34:31.00,00:34:31.00,BECAUSE YOU COME TO THE MERGE
1156,00:34:32.27,00:34:32.27,AND YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT
1157,00:34:35.13,00:34:35.13,"SOMETHING, THAT'S NOT A NUMBER."
1158,00:34:37.27,00:34:37.27,THAT'S LESS OF A TRIBE.
1159,00:34:38.27,00:34:38.27,I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE
1160,00:34:39.77,00:34:39.77,THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND TEAM
1161,00:34:41.90,00:34:41.90,UNITY STRENGTH.

1169,00:35:00.57,00:35:00.57,HE S'MORES.
1170,00:35:01.30,00:35:01.30,"YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF A LAME"

1172,00:35:04.80,00:35:04.80,BUT --
1173,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,"BRANDON, THE MOST ANNOYING"

1175,00:35:10.10,00:35:10.10,SHE'S GOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT
1176,00:35:13.03,00:35:13.03,A LOT.
1177,00:35:13.77,00:35:13.77,"I MEAN, IT'S NOT BAD."
1178,00:35:15.40,00:35:15.40,IT'S JUST SOMETIMES IT GETS A
1179,00:35:16.77,00:35:16.77,LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.
1180,00:35:17.80,00:35:17.80,"BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I MEAN,"
1181,00:35:19.13,00:35:19.13,SHE'S JUST GOT A LOT OF
1182,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93,OPINIONS.
1183,00:35:21.57,00:35:21.57,"Jeff: EDNA, DOES THAT RING"
1184,00:35:22.77,00:35:22.77,TRUE TO YOU?
1185,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33,"NO, I DON'T THINK SO."
1186,00:35:26.00,00:35:26.00,YOKE I'M OUT THERE VOICING MY

1189,00:35:34.43,00:35:34.43,CAMP.
1190,00:35:35.13,00:35:35.13,"EDNA, THE MOST ANNOYING THING"

1192,00:35:38.40,00:35:38.40,I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO
1193,00:35:40.10,00:35:40.10,ENGAGE STACEY.
1194,00:35:41.10,00:35:41.10,I'VE TRIED MANY TIMES TO GET TO

1205,00:35:59.50,00:35:59.50,DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S LOOKING
1206,00:36:00.87,00:36:00.87,"FOR, HOW MUCH SHE'S WANTING FROM"
1207,00:36:02.20,00:36:02.20,ME.

1220,00:36:21.57,00:36:21.57,AND HE SAYS HE'S NOTHING LIKE
1221,00:36:23.27,00:36:23.27,HIM AND THIS OR THAT BUT IT'S
1222,00:36:25.27,00:36:25.27,"ONE THING THAT'S JUST, DARN,"
1223,00:36:27.33,00:36:27.33,YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD KID BUT WHY
