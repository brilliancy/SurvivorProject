652,00:19:59.80,00:19:59.80,FROM FEAR.

663,00:20:13.70,00:20:13.70,THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DOWNFALL.

721,00:21:41.13,00:21:41.13,WITH OTHERS.
722,00:21:43.03,00:21:43.03,AND HE'S SHOWING US THESE LITTLE
723,00:21:45.60,00:21:45.60,"TINY TRICKS, LITTLE THINGS LIKE"
724,00:21:46.47,00:21:46.47,THAT.

730,00:22:08.63,00:22:08.63,I WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT
731,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,THERE'S A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
732,00:22:14.33,00:22:14.33,SOMEWHERE.
733,00:22:14.63,00:22:14.63,"BUT SO FAR, NOTHING."
734,00:22:16.47,00:22:16.47,I DON'T THINK I NEED IT.
735,00:22:18.67,00:22:18.67,BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE IT IN YOUR

744,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,AND THEN SHE GOES LOOKING FOR
745,00:22:34.97,00:22:34.97,THE IMMUNITY IDOL LIKE CRAZY.
746,00:22:36.63,00:22:36.63,"I MEAN, LOOK, WHEN I GOT ON TO"
747,00:22:38.87,00:22:38.87,THIS BEACH I WASN'T THINKING
748,00:22:40.37,00:22:40.37,ABOUT AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
749,00:22:41.77,00:22:41.77,I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING A
750,00:22:43.03,00:22:43.03,SHELTER TOGETHER AND MAKING THIS
751,00:22:44.77,00:22:44.77,AS LIVABLE AS POSSIBLE.
752,00:22:46.00,00:22:46.00,"SO NO QUESTION ABOUT IT,"
753,00:22:47.53,00:22:47.53,CHRISTINE IS TARGET NUMBER ONE.

757,00:23:06.37,00:23:06.37,HAVE A DIP.
758,00:23:07.03,00:23:07.03,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'D HAD
759,00:23:08.60,00:23:08.60,"SEEN THIS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL"
760,00:23:09.60,00:23:09.60,PLACE THAT WE'RE IN.
761,00:23:10.60,00:23:10.60,AND I WAS SO EXCITED.

775,00:23:31.33,00:23:31.33,I'M NOT A TEACHER.
776,00:23:32.13,00:23:32.13,I HAVE AN MBA.
777,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,I'VE WON OVER 20 POKER

782,00:23:42.17,00:23:42.17,WHY WOULD I.
783,00:23:42.80,00:23:42.80,WHO IS MARRIED?
784,00:23:44.20,00:23:44.20,GOOD CALL.

786,00:23:47.30,00:23:47.30,I'VE BEEN GAY ALL MY LIFE--
787,00:23:49.30,00:23:49.30,MOST OF MY LIFE.
788,00:23:50.50,00:23:50.50,I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED.
789,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,"PLEASE, THERE ARE FEATHERS"
790,00:23:54.20,00:23:54.20,FLYING AROUND ME
791,00:23:54.63,00:23:54.63,( LAUGHTER )
792,00:23:57.37,00:23:57.37,"YOU KNOW, I'M HERE FOR THE"
793,00:23:58.93,00:23:58.93,MILLION DOLLARS JUST LIKE

795,00:24:01.37,00:24:01.37,FOR ANOTHER REASON-- I'M OLDER
796,00:24:02.60,00:24:02.60,"THAN MOST OF THOSE OTHER GUYS,"
797,00:24:04.63,00:24:04.63,AND I'M EXPERIENCING LIFE FREE
798,00:24:08.30,00:24:08.30,OF EVERYTHING THAT WOULD
799,00:24:09.27,00:24:09.27,RESTRICT ME.
800,00:24:09.63,00:24:09.63,I CAME OUT OF THE JOB BECAUSE I
801,00:24:11.67,00:24:11.67,"FELT, YOU KNOW, IF IT COULD"
802,00:24:14.63,00:24:14.63,OTHER COPS BEHIND ME.
803,00:24:15.03,00:24:15.03,RIGHT.
804,00:24:15.47,00:24:15.47,IT WOULD HELP THEM.
805,00:24:17.37,00:24:17.37,"BEING GAY, IT'S WHO I AM."
806,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT... I THINK
807,00:24:21.60,00:24:21.60,"I LOOK LIKE A BEAR, WHAT DO YOU"
808,00:24:22.80,00:24:22.80,THINK?
809,00:24:23.00,00:24:23.00,A BEAR.
810,00:24:24.33,00:24:24.33,I'VE BEEN CALLED DADDY BEAR.
811,00:24:27.30,00:24:27.30,"I'M A BEAR, DEFINITELY A BEAR."
812,00:24:29.17,00:24:29.17,I'M PAPA BEAR FROM NOW ON.
813,00:24:31.37,00:24:31.37,IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING GAY.
814,00:24:33.33,00:24:33.33,IT'S ABOUT SURVIVING.
815,00:24:34.03,00:24:34.03,I'M A GUY WHO SIA TEAM PLAYER
816,00:24:37.77,00:24:37.77,AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL SEE THAT
817,00:24:38.83,00:24:38.83,AND KEEP ME.
818,00:24:39.43,00:24:39.43,WE NEED TO GET FIRE GOING.
819,00:24:41.77,00:24:41.77,FIRE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE EXTRA
820,00:24:43.43,00:24:43.43,WATER.
821,00:24:43.87,00:24:43.87,IT FEELS LIKE THE TRIBE IS
822,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,REALLY SPENDING THIS TIME KIND
823,00:24:46.87,00:24:46.87,OF FORMING A BOND BUT COMING
824,00:24:48.53,00:24:48.53,"INTO TODAY, I HAD THESE HOPES"
825,00:24:50.60,00:24:50.60,"THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'D BE REALLY"
826,00:24:52.93,00:24:52.93,"ORGANIZED, ESPECIALLY AFTER"
827,00:24:53.53,00:24:53.53,WINNING AND GETTING THE FLINT
828,00:24:54.20,00:24:54.20,AND THE FOOD.
829,00:24:55.37,00:24:55.37,SO IN MY MIND THIS DAY WAS GOG
830,00:24:57.63,00:24:57.63,END WITH KIND OF THE SHELTER
831,00:24:58.83,00:24:58.83,DONE.
832,00:24:59.20,00:24:59.20,I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I
833,00:25:00.37,00:25:00.37,WATCH AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE
834,00:25:01.50,00:25:01.50,"SHELTER ON DAY ONE, IT WORRIES"
835,00:25:03.53,00:25:03.53,ME.
836,00:25:04.77,00:25:04.77,WELL--
837,00:25:05.77,00:25:05.77,IT'S OKAY.
838,00:25:06.63,00:25:06.63,WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS.
839,00:25:07.77,00:25:07.77,WE'LL BE FINE.
840,00:25:08.43,00:25:08.43,I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET
841,00:25:10.47,00:25:10.47,THROUGH THIS.
842,00:25:12.13,00:25:12.13,IT PROBABLY TAKES A WHILE TO
843,00:25:13.43,00:25:13.43,RELAX AND LET THINGS HAPPEN.
844,00:25:14.80,00:25:14.80,I HAVE SIX KIDS.
845,00:25:15.80,00:25:15.80,I'M USED TO BEING IN CHARGE.
846,00:25:17.43,00:25:17.43,"HONESTLY, IF IT DOESN'T RAIN"
847,00:25:19.43,00:25:19.43,TONIGHT I'M SO HAPPY SLEEPING ON
848,00:25:21.00,00:25:21.00,THE GROUND.
849,00:25:21.60,00:25:21.60,IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE
850,00:25:23.17,00:25:23.17,"KIND OF A LEADER, AND FOR ME,"
851,00:25:26.13,00:25:26.13,"OZZY, HE'S A LITTLE BOB MARLEY"
852,00:25:27.43,00:25:27.43,TO ME.
853,00:25:27.93,00:25:27.93,"YOU KNOW, I'M A PLANNER."
854,00:25:29.60,00:25:29.60,AND I'M NOT SURE BOB MARLEY IS.
855,00:25:38.77,00:25:38.77,"SO FAR, SO GOOD."
856,00:25:46.33,00:25:46.33,"BY THE WAY, WHAT'S THIS RIGHT"
857,00:25:50.10,00:25:50.10,HERE?
858,00:25:50.43,00:25:50.43,"LOCO, MAN."
859,00:25:51.53,00:25:51.53,"YOU MEAN, BECAUSE YOU'RE A"

862,00:25:55.70,00:25:55.70,"THOUGHT IT SAID ""LOVE."""
863,00:25:58.27,00:25:58.27,AND I WAS LIKE IT SAYS LOCO.

1056,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,TO GO.
1057,00:31:19.47,00:31:19.47,"I DON'T CRACK, SO THIS IS"
1058,00:31:20.73,00:31:20.73,KILLING ME.

1508,00:45:02.30,00:45:02.30,WANTED TO DO.
1509,00:45:03.63,00:45:03.63,SHE TRIED.
1510,00:45:04.23,00:45:04.23,SHE FAILED.
1511,00:45:18.27,00:45:18.27,HELL OF A JOB.

1516,00:45:27.93,00:45:27.93,I WE WON THE CHALLENGE TODAY
1517,00:45:30.03,00:45:30.03,BUT I THINK UNDERNEATH THIS
1518,00:45:31.70,00:45:31.70,CELEBRATORY TONE THERE IS AN
1519,00:45:33.60,00:45:33.60,UNEASINESS BECAUSE JEFF
1520,00:45:35.37,00:45:35.37,MENTIONED THAT THE IMMUNITY IDOL
1521,00:45:37.77,00:45:37.77,"CLUE HIDDEN AT CAMP, PEOPLE NOW"
1522,00:45:39.17,00:45:39.17,"KNOW THAT THE GAME HAS STARTED,"
1523,00:45:42.13,00:45:42.13,AND IT MIGHT JUST GET RUTHLESS.
1524,00:45:48.30,00:45:48.30,LET'S JUST LOOK.
1525,00:45:50.77,00:45:50.77,"WE GOT TO LOOK, TOO."
1526,00:45:52.37,00:45:52.37,"HELL, YES."
1527,00:45:57.43,00:45:57.43,THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IS
1528,00:46:00.37,00:46:00.37,HERE SOMEWHERE.
1529,00:46:00.97,00:46:00.97,IT'S A LOT OF SOMEWHERE IT COULD
1530,00:46:03.47,00:46:03.47,BE.
1531,00:46:07.03,00:46:07.03,LOOKING LIKE I'M LOOKING AND
1532,00:46:08.93,00:46:08.93,WORKING AT THE SAME TIME.
1533,00:46:09.80,00:46:09.80,"TURNING OVER ROCK, LOOKING UP"
1534,00:46:11.47,00:46:11.47,"HIGH, IN BIG TREES, LOOKING IN"
1535,00:46:12.50,00:46:12.50,THE HOLES OF THE TREES.
1536,00:46:13.83,00:46:13.83,I'VE BEEN LOOKING.
1537,00:46:16.83,00:46:16.83,PROBABLY BEING RIGHT IN OUR FACE
1538,00:46:17.60,00:46:17.60,AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
1539,00:46:19.97,00:46:19.97,I PROBABLY COULD HAVE ALREADY
1540,00:46:21.10,00:46:21.10,STUMBLED OVER IT AND DON'T EVEN
1541,00:46:22.13,00:46:22.13,KNOW IT.
1542,00:46:23.63,00:46:23.63,I PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY.
1543,00:46:25.83,00:46:25.83,COULD PROBABLY BE RIGHT THERE.
1544,00:46:45.53,00:46:45.53,I KIND OF HAVE SOMETHING TO
1545,00:46:47.53,00:46:47.53,SAY.
1546,00:46:48.13,00:46:48.13,I FELT AWFUL THAT WE LOST THAT
1547,00:46:49.00,00:46:49.00,"CHALLENGE, AND I KNOW THAT I WAS"
1548,00:46:50.53,00:46:50.53,"A BIG PART OF THAT LAST PORTION,"
1549,00:46:52.47,00:46:52.47,"BUT FOR SOMEONE, YOU,"
1550,00:46:54.83,00:46:54.83,"PERSONALLY, WHO YOU MADE US LOOK"
1551,00:46:55.80,00:46:55.80,"WEAK, AND I FEEL LIKE-- YEAH,"
1552,00:46:57.67,00:46:57.67,AND YOU CAN KEEP MAKING FACES
1553,00:46:59.63,00:46:59.63,BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME TRUST
1554,00:47:00.97,00:47:00.97,SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'RE MAKING
1555,00:47:02.37,00:47:02.37,FACES BEHIND MY BACK WHEN I
1556,00:47:04.13,00:47:04.13,ALREADY FEEL SO AWFUL.
1557,00:47:05.13,00:47:05.13,"FELT WORSE THAN YOU DID, I'M"
1558,00:47:06.97,00:47:06.97,SORRY--
1559,00:47:07.60,00:47:07.60,YOU DIDN'T FEEL WORSE.
1560,00:47:08.67,00:47:08.67,NO ONE CAN FEEL WORSE THAN I DO
1561,00:47:10.33,00:47:10.33,RIGHT NOW.
1562,00:47:11.47,00:47:11.47,I FEEL TERRIBLE.
1563,00:47:12.70,00:47:12.70,"LIKE, WHEN SOMEBODY IS ALREADY"
1564,00:47:13.80,00:47:13.80,"DOWN, WHY PUSH THEM DOWN EVEN"
1565,00:47:15.43,00:47:15.43,MORE?
1566,00:47:15.93,00:47:15.93,THAT'S ALL THAT I'M SAYING.
1567,00:47:17.30,00:47:17.30,I REALLY TRIED TO BE POSITIVE
1568,00:47:18.43,00:47:18.43,"FOR US, AND I DO, I FEEL"
1569,00:47:20.77,00:47:20.77,TERRIBLE.
1570,00:47:21.30,00:47:21.30,YOU WERE MAKING FACES BEHIND MY
1571,00:47:22.60,00:47:22.60,"BACK, AND THEN YOU SAY--"
1572,00:47:23.63,00:47:23.63,"ACTUALLY, YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY"
1573,00:47:24.63,00:47:24.63,OF THAT.
1574,00:47:25.27,00:47:25.27,I DID.
1575,00:47:25.97,00:47:25.97,JEFF CALLED IT OUT.
1576,00:47:26.93,00:47:26.93,"HE SAID I WAS MIMING, WHEN"
1577,00:47:28.70,00:47:28.70,YOU SAID YOU FEEL SORT OF BAD I
1578,00:47:30.53,00:47:30.53,ROLLED MY EYES.
1579,00:47:31.27,00:47:31.27,I DID.
1580,00:47:31.93,00:47:31.93,ALL I'M SAYING IS TRY NOT TO
1581,00:47:33.50,00:47:33.50,JUST HURRY UP AND TURN ON
1582,00:47:35.43,00:47:35.43,SOMEONE.
1583,00:47:35.93,00:47:35.93,I APOLOGIZE IF THAT'S HOW IT
1584,00:47:37.43,00:47:37.43,CAME ACROSS.
1585,00:47:38.10,00:47:38.10,I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE TURNING ON
1586,00:47:40.20,00:47:40.20,YOU.
1587,00:47:40.60,00:47:40.60,EVERYBODY GAVE 100%.
1588,00:47:41.33,00:47:41.33,THEY DID.
1589,00:47:43.43,00:47:43.43,I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYBODY
1590,00:47:44.03,00:47:44.03,THAT WOULD DENY THAT.
1591,00:47:45.13,00:47:45.13,SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HOLD ME
1592,00:47:46.93,00:47:46.93,BACK FROM THIS GAME IS I'M
1593,00:47:48.70,00:47:48.70,EXTREMELY HOW ABOUT.
1594,00:47:49.97,00:47:49.97,I EITHER LOVE YOU OR HATE YOU
1595,00:47:51.60,00:47:51.60,AND YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW.
1596,00:47:52.60,00:47:52.60,I KNOW IT WASN'T SMART TO GO OFF
1597,00:47:54.13,00:47:54.13,ON JIM IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
1598,00:47:56.60,00:47:56.60,IT'S FACT.
1599,00:47:57.43,00:47:57.43,I DIDN'T DO WELL AT THE LAST
1600,00:47:58.80,00:47:58.80,PART OF THE CHALLENGE.
1601,00:47:59.80,00:47:59.80,I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT.
1602,00:48:03.13,00:48:03.13,I'M NOT PUTTING YOUR NAME
1603,00:48:05.60,00:48:05.60,DOWN.
1604,00:48:05.93,00:48:05.93,I'M NOT.
1605,00:48:07.60,00:48:07.60,>>
1606,00:48:08.10,00:48:08.10,I WON'T PUT YOURS DOWN.
1607,00:48:09.77,00:48:09.77,YOU'RE A NICE PERSON AND YOUR
1608,00:48:10.97,00:48:10.97,HEART IS HERE.
1609,00:48:11.70,00:48:11.70,HAVING STARTED THE GAME IN A
1610,00:48:13.03,00:48:13.03,"WAY THAT WAS PRETTY EMOTIONAL, I"
1611,00:48:14.17,00:48:14.17,THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY
1612,00:48:15.50,00:48:15.50,THAT THE TRIBE IS GOING TO LOOK
1613,00:48:16.60,00:48:16.60,AT ME AND SAY THAT OUTBREAK
1614,00:48:18.83,00:48:18.83,BEING EMOTIONAL LIKE THAT IS A
1615,00:48:20.03,00:48:20.03,LIABILITY FOR THE TRIBE.
1616,00:48:21.77,00:48:21.77,BUT I'M HOPING PEOPLE WILL BASE
1617,00:48:23.27,00:48:23.27,"THEIR DECISIONS ON, YOU KNOW,"
1618,00:48:25.63,00:48:25.63,"TODAY FORWARD, ESPECIALLY WITH"
1619,00:48:27.27,00:48:27.27,THE CONFLICT TODAY WITH SEMHAR
1620,00:48:29.63,00:48:29.63,AND JIM.
1621,00:48:30.67,00:48:30.67,YOU KNOW WHAT?
1622,00:48:31.77,00:48:31.77,THE REALITY IS SHE DESERVES TO
1623,00:48:33.13,00:48:33.13,GO.
1624,00:48:33.93,00:48:33.93,YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEMHAR?
1625,00:48:35.17,00:48:35.17,YEAH.
1626,00:48:37.43,00:48:37.43,"SHE SCREWED UP THE CHALLENGE,"
1627,00:48:39.30,00:48:39.30,WHICH SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE
1628,00:48:41.10,00:48:41.10,VOLUNTEERED TO DO.
1629,00:48:41.63,00:48:41.63,YEAH.
1630,00:48:43.27,00:48:43.27,MY GUT TELLS ME RIGHT NOW THAT
1631,00:48:43.63,00:48:43.63,THE TIMING OF TRIBAL COUNCIL
1632,00:48:45.63,00:48:45.63,BEING SO CLOSE AND THEN THE
1633,00:48:48.70,00:48:48.70,ARGUMENT AT CAMP THAT IT MIGHT
1634,00:48:50.47,00:48:50.47,BE SEMHAR GOING HOME.
1635,00:48:52.13,00:48:52.13,SO IT'S SEMHAR?
1636,00:48:53.67,00:48:53.67,THAT'S WHAT I'M PUTTING DOWN.
1637,00:48:54.97,00:48:54.97,OKAY.
1638,00:48:56.63,00:48:56.63,I JUST THINK THAT FOR THIS
1639,00:48:58.10,00:48:58.10,"FIRST VOTE, LIKE, WE REALLY NEED"
1640,00:48:59.60,00:48:59.60,TO THINK HARD.
1641,00:49:01.47,00:49:01.47,I DON'T-- I DON'T NECESSARILY
1642,00:49:03.70,00:49:03.70,THINK BECAUSE SHE MESSED UP ON
1643,00:49:05.43,00:49:05.43,THIS CHALLENGE THAT SHE SHOULD
1644,00:49:06.93,00:49:06.93,"GO, I REALLY DON'T."
1645,00:49:07.53,00:49:07.53,REALLY?
1646,00:49:07.97,00:49:07.97,I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A
1647,00:49:09.80,00:49:09.80,HARD SELL TO THE WHOLE GROUP.
1648,00:49:10.93,00:49:10.93,LISTEN TO THIS.
1649,00:49:11.70,00:49:11.70,JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF
1650,00:49:12.67,00:49:12.67,TRYING TO KEEP A STRONG TRIBE
1651,00:49:15.10,00:49:15.10,HAVING YOU THREE GIRLS IS
1652,00:49:16.70,00:49:16.70,ACTUALLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.
1653,00:49:19.10,00:49:19.10,"DAWN, I THINK SHE DID REALLY,"
1654,00:49:20.30,00:49:20.30,REALLY WELL.
1655,00:49:20.80,00:49:20.80,TOTALLY.
1656,00:49:21.33,00:49:21.33,SHE'S STRONG.
1657,00:49:22.67,00:49:22.67,"YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT"
1658,00:49:24.70,00:49:24.70,COCHRAN IS--
1659,00:49:25.33,00:49:25.33,I KNOW.
1660,00:49:25.80,00:49:25.80,HE'S IN THE MIDDLE.
1661,00:49:26.80,00:49:26.80,"AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE, LIKE,"
1662,00:49:29.17,00:49:29.17,OUR STRONG PLAYER.
1663,00:49:30.63,00:49:30.63,HE'S JUST NOT AS COORDINATED.
1664,00:49:32.67,00:49:32.67,HE'S JUST NOT ATHLETIC.
1665,00:49:36.13,00:49:36.13,YOU GOT COCHRAN ON ONE HAND THAT
1666,00:49:38.50,00:49:38.50,REALLY IS NOT SHOWING MUCH IN
1667,00:49:40.33,00:49:40.33,THE PHYSICALITY SENSE AND YOU'VE
1668,00:49:41.53,00:49:41.53,GOT SEMHAR ON THE OTHER.
1669,00:49:43.00,00:49:43.00,SHE BASICALLY BLEW THE CHALLENGE
1670,00:49:44.00,00:49:44.00,"FOR US, BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO"
1671,00:49:47.10,00:49:47.10,BLAME SEMHAR IN THIS SITUATION.
1672,00:49:48.70,00:49:48.70,IT TAKES BALLS TO STEP UP.
1673,00:49:50.53,00:49:50.53,AND SHE DID TAKE A CHANCE.
1674,00:49:51.67,00:49:51.67,BUT SHE-- I'D RATHER HAVE
1675,00:49:55.67,00:49:55.67,SOMEBODY NOT STEP UP THAN
1676,00:49:57.30,00:49:57.30,SOMEBODY WHO IS SO UNAWARE OF
1677,00:49:59.50,00:49:59.50,THEIR INABILITIES.
1678,00:50:00.13,00:50:00.13,I DON'T KNOW.
1679,00:50:00.97,00:50:00.97,SEMHAR KNOWS SHE'S ON THE
1680,00:50:03.43,00:50:03.43,CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.
1681,00:50:04.27,00:50:04.27,"HERE'S MY CONCERN, OZZY WANTS"
1682,00:50:05.80,00:50:05.80,HER AROUND FOR A REASON AND IT'S
1683,00:50:07.00,00:50:07.00,ROUND ONE AND IT SCARES ME THAT
1684,00:50:08.50,00:50:08.50,HE ALREADY HAS A REASON TO KEEP
1685,00:50:09.93,00:50:09.93,HER AROUND.
1686,00:50:10.37,00:50:10.37,LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS
1687,00:50:11.47,00:50:11.47,REALLY CAREFULLY.
1688,00:50:12.37,00:50:12.37,I MEAN--
1689,00:50:13.20,00:50:13.20,I'M CONCERNED THAT OZZY MIGHT
1690,00:50:15.27,00:50:15.27,GET IN AN ALLIANCE WITH ALL THE
1691,00:50:17.93,00:50:17.93,GIRLS.
1692,00:50:18.13,00:50:18.13,HE HAS CHARM.
1693,00:50:18.70,00:50:18.70,I COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING.
1694,00:50:19.97,00:50:19.97,BUT SEMHAR IS PRETTY MUCH
1695,00:50:22.20,00:50:22.20,USELESS.
1696,00:50:22.77,00:50:22.77,HER BODY IS MESMERIZING BUT IT'S
1697,00:50:25.50,00:50:25.50,NOT HYPNOTIZING AND IT BLOWS MY
1698,00:50:26.93,00:50:26.93,MIND THAT OZZY MIGHT BE ACTUALLY
1699,00:50:28.70,00:50:28.70,FACTORING IN THAT SNUGGLE
1700,00:50:30.77,00:50:30.77,FACTOR.
1701,00:50:31.30,00:50:31.30,IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.
1702,00:50:32.67,00:50:32.67,I'M ON YOUR SIDE.
