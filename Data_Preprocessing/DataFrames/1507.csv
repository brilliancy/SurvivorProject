2,00:00:02.21,00:00:02.21,"Survivor, at Zhan Hu, James was doomed."
3,00:00:05.96,00:00:05.96,">> If we lose tomorrow's immunity, James is going to be"
4,00:00:08.04,00:00:08.04,gone. >> PROBST: But at the reward
5,00:00:10.04,00:00:10.04,challenge... Fei Long wins reward!
6,00:00:13.00,00:00:13.00,"...Fei Long kidnapped their old tribe mate, giving him a chance"
7,00:00:15.71,00:00:15.71,"to survive. James, this is for you."
8,00:00:21.75,00:00:21.75,"At Fei Long, James chose Todd to receive the clue to the hidden"
9,00:00:25.25,00:00:25.25,immunity idol. >> I know what they're talking
10,00:00:27.71,00:00:27.71,about. It's those stupid bats above the
11,00:00:30.04,00:00:30.04,freaking thing. >> PROBST: Todd found the hidden
12,00:00:35.46,00:00:35.46,"immunity idol, which was clearly marked ""Congratulations,"" and"
13,00:00:39.04,00:00:39.04,gave it to James as part of his and Amanda's plan to throw the
14,00:00:42.21,00:00:42.21,immunity challenge and take out a Zhan Hu member.
15,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,>> Throw it. >> Because that's Jaime's ticket
16,00:00:47.12,00:00:47.12,home. James loses immunity; they vote
17,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,"for him, but he uses the idol to get rid of Jaime."
18,00:00:53.96,00:00:53.96,>> PROBST: He then told James about the second idol hidden at
19,00:00:56.71,00:00:56.71,the Zhan Hu camp. >> All I have to do is stay
20,00:01:00.17,00:01:00.17,"focused, get the other idol. Now I'll have both of them."
21,00:01:03.38,00:01:03.38,>> PROBST: But at the immunity challenge...
22,00:01:05.54,00:01:05.54,Go. >> Ah!
23,00:01:08.04,00:01:08.04,>> PROBST: ...Denise couldn't stomach the chicken fetus...
24,00:01:10.46,00:01:10.46,">> I can't swallow it. You can do it, James."
25,00:01:12.67,00:01:12.67,Eat it up. >> PROBST: ...making it
26,00:01:14.46,00:01:14.46,"impossible for James to deliberately lose the challenge,"
27,00:01:17.08,00:01:17.08,ruining Todd's plan. Zhan Hu wins immunity.
28,00:01:20.42,00:01:20.42,With Fei Long facing tribal council...
29,00:01:22.42,00:01:22.42,>> Genius idea smashed. >> PROBST: ...Sherea seemed like
30,00:01:25.54,00:01:25.54,"a sure bet to go home, but Courtney lobbied to get rid of"
31,00:01:29.12,00:01:29.12,Jean-Robert. >> That's my enemy.
32,00:01:31.29,00:01:31.29,>> I don't trust Sherea. I trust her more than I trust
33,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,Jean-Robert. >> I feel like we should vote
34,00:01:35.88,00:01:35.88,"out Jean-Robert tonight. >> Todd, I don't know."
35,00:01:37.88,00:01:37.88,My gut feeling is that I don't trust Sherea.
36,00:01:40.17,00:01:40.17,>> And my gut's saying Jean- Robert.
37,00:01:41.92,00:01:41.92,"This sucks. >> PROBST: At tribal council,"
38,00:01:46.04,00:01:46.04,Courtney attacked Jean-Robert's character.
39,00:01:48.67,00:01:48.67,">> He walks around, he talks a lot, a lot of judgments of other"
40,00:01:50.79,00:01:50.79,people. He's just a crappy person.
41,00:01:53.79,00:01:53.79,">> PROBST: Despite Courtney's plea to get rid of Jean-Robert,"
42,00:01:56.83,00:01:56.83,the tribe saved him once again. Sixth person voted out of
43,00:02:00.38,00:02:00.38,"Survivor: China, Sherea. Ten are left."
44,00:02:06.17,00:02:06.17,Who will be voted out tonight? >> That was a little bit of a
45,00:02:19.58,00:02:19.58,surprise. I didn't even know there was
46,00:02:21.12,00:02:21.12,"that kind of tension. >> I promise you, Amanda, if"
47,00:02:30.42,00:02:30.42,"somebody did that to you, you'd be a little bit upset about it"
48,00:02:32.50,00:02:32.50,"too. >> I personally, Jean-Robert,"
49,00:02:34.83,00:02:34.83,feel like my personal feelings towards you have changed.
50,00:02:37.71,00:02:37.71,I like the guy you kind of showed me who you can be.
51,00:02:41.04,00:02:41.04,"I can't speak for Courtney, and you can't speak for her."
52,00:02:44.08,00:02:44.08,"And you know, I just... I just... you guys have a tiff."
53,00:02:47.50,00:02:47.50,"And if you guys resolve it, that's what you guys can do."
54,00:02:49.83,00:02:49.83,"If not, then not, you know? >> Jean-Robert, he's horrible to"
55,00:02:52.88,00:02:52.88,me. He's not nice to me.
56,00:02:56.17,00:02:56.17,"They suck up to him, even the two people who want to be, like,"
57,00:02:59.62,00:02:59.62,"my friends-- like, ""friends""-- Todd and Amanda."
58,00:03:03.21,00:03:03.21,I don't feel like I really need to be anybody's friend in this
59,00:03:05.12,00:03:05.12,game. I dislike everyone else more
60,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,than I dislike Todd and Amanda. I think they mistake that for
61,00:03:10.79,00:03:10.79,friendship.  Captioning sponsored by

64,00:04:25.46,00:04:25.46,"now, because we told you we were going to stick with you."
65,00:04:34.12,00:04:34.12,You know that? >> Yeah.
66,00:04:38.33,00:04:38.33,">> Yeah, to each other, yeah. >> Don't let me down, okay?"
67,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,>> Let you down how? >> Just stick with us.
68,00:04:50.04,00:04:50.04,"As long as we all stick together, you know, if we merge,"
69,00:04:53.62,00:04:53.62,we basically sacrificed one of our old tribe mates for you.
70,00:04:56.08,00:04:56.08,>> We'll see how it goes. Hopefully...
71,00:04:59.33,00:04:59.33,">> I mean, like, honestly, like, I like you."
72,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,"Like, I think, like... I think you've been a huge, like,"
73,00:05:04.17,00:05:04.17,"competitor in this game, and, like, I'm one of those people,"
74,00:05:06.25,00:05:06.25,"like, I would rather see you go further just because I really do"
75,00:05:08.46,00:05:08.46,think you deserve it. I really like James personally.
76,00:05:11.67,00:05:11.67,I do-- whether he's a really good con man or he is exactly
77,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,"how he puts himself out to be. From what I've seen so far, my"
78,00:05:19.29,00:05:19.29,"gut instinct is to trust James. >> I was kidnapped, so, you"
79,00:05:54.33,00:05:54.33,"know, I got the clue for the idols."
80,00:05:56.04,00:05:56.04,I wasn't going to do like Todd did and be impatient.
81,00:05:58.42,00:05:58.42,There are so many times when you're by yourself.
82,00:06:07.83,00:06:07.83,I picked off one. It was the wrong one.
83,00:06:09.67,00:06:09.67,It was a blank sheet of wood. So I hurried and picked off the
84,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,second one. I kind of had to hustle off to
85,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,my bag and hide it. Did y'all get anything?
86,00:06:30.21,00:06:30.21,">> We didn't rack up, but we got a decent amount."
87,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,">> So I have it now. I have it in my position, and I"
88,00:06:36.04,00:06:36.04,have the two idols. That's funny.
89,00:06:38.79,00:06:38.79,I'm on Survivor with two idols. >> Yeah.
90,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,">> Yes, it is. >> This morning, I slept in."
91,00:07:01.67,00:07:01.67,I was in a good mood. And Courtney comes up and sits
92,00:07:03.88,00:07:03.88,"down, and she's like ( sighing )."
93,00:07:07.25,00:07:07.25,"We all kind of look at her like, ""Uh, are you okay, Courtney?"""
94,00:07:10.33,00:07:10.33,>> Jean-Robert could have gone last night.
95,00:07:12.33,00:07:12.33,>> What? >> He could have gone last
96,00:07:13.58,00:07:13.58,night. >> From the way that I'm playing
97,00:07:15.88,00:07:15.88,"the game, I need him. >> Okay."
98,00:07:18.92,00:07:18.92,">> From the way you're playing the game, you didn't."
99,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,">> But, like, when I make a point to you guys that, like,"
100,00:07:23.12,00:07:23.12,"this guy does not like me, he's not nice to me, and I don't feel"
101,00:07:25.38,00:07:25.38,"like you stick up for me, I feel like you play, like, ""Okay,"
102,00:07:28.25,00:07:28.25,"well, we need him, so da, da, da, da,"" I can't go along with"
103,00:07:31.04,00:07:31.04,that. >> I don't realize that I do
104,00:07:33.38,00:07:33.38,"that, Courtney, and I would love to stand up for you."
105,00:07:36.25,00:07:36.25,">> You don't have to even stand... just, like, don't"
106,00:07:38.21,00:07:38.21,"pander to him and say, ""You have a point, Jean-Robert."""
107,00:07:42.25,00:07:42.25,>> You have your opinion about him.
108,00:07:43.96,00:07:43.96,You don't have to like him. >> But I don't say anything to
109,00:07:45.75,00:07:45.75,him. >> I know you don't.
110,00:07:47.17,00:07:47.17,>> But he walks around falling around like he's the god
111,00:07:49.38,00:07:49.38,"everything, and you guys are all like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."""
112,00:07:51.21,00:07:51.21,">> We can't have him know that we don't like him, Courtney."
113,00:07:53.29,00:07:53.29,"We can't, or else he will swap on us."
114,00:07:55.29,00:07:55.29,>> He's not here. You can say something to me.
115,00:07:57.04,00:07:57.04,"Like, the three of you can... >> Courtney, you are right."
116,00:07:58.92,00:07:58.92,>> All right. You know...
117,00:08:00.67,00:08:00.67,>> It does worry me that Courtney will continue to vote
118,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,"for Jean-Robert every single time, because all the other"
119,00:08:07.46,00:08:07.46,"tribe, if there is a merge, needs to know that one person is"
120,00:08:10.21,00:08:10.21,"voting against Jean-Robert, and they will automatically have"
121,00:08:13.21,00:08:13.21,"Jaime, Peih-Gee, and Erik with Courtney voting against Jean-"
122,00:08:16.38,00:08:16.38,"Robert, and that's a campaign to get him off, which is losing one"
123,00:08:19.42,00:08:19.42,of our numbers. Can we patch things up between
124,00:08:21.42,00:08:21.42,us instead of having hard feelings like that?
125,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,">> What difference does it make? >> It makes a big difference,"
126,00:08:26.92,00:08:26.92,Courtney. >> What does she want?
127,00:08:36.29,00:08:36.29,"Like, what does she expect from me?"
128,00:08:38.17,00:08:38.17,"Right now I need my numbers, and Jean-Robert is one of my"
129,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83,"numbers. Deal with it, bitch."
130,00:09:20.92,00:09:20.92,">> This used to be hanging on the archway, and it looks like"
131,00:09:24.17,00:09:24.17,"someone took it off. I don't know if it was James,"
132,00:09:28.12,00:09:28.12,because James now knows that there's a hidden immunity idol
133,00:09:30.12,00:09:30.12,as well. I don't know if he knows where
134,00:09:32.21,00:09:32.21,"it is or what it is, but you know, it looks idol-ish."
135,00:09:39.04,00:09:39.04,Peih-Gee didn't really think much of it.
136,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,She doesn't know there's a hidden idol yet.
137,00:09:41.96,00:09:41.96,"So Peih-Gee left. I just was like, ""Well, I guess"
138,00:09:44.54,00:09:44.54,"I'll grab it,"" and put it in my bag."
139,00:09:49.54,00:09:49.54,">> It could definitely say, like, ""Immunity idol"" in"
140,00:09:51.50,00:09:51.50,"Chinese, and I'd have no idea. It's a weird symbol, so I don't"
141,00:09:53.92,00:09:53.92,know what it stands for. I just want to look in his bag.
142,00:10:06.42,00:10:06.42,Do you think he'll see me if I pull it out?
143,00:10:19.92,00:10:19.92,I knew it. He has one in here.
144,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,"Hey, you watch over there. Make sure they're not coming"
145,00:10:25.67,00:10:25.67,back. Peih-Gee and James went off to
146,00:10:31.21,00:10:31.21,"go frog hunting, so I saw James' bag sitting there, and I figured"
147,00:10:35.42,00:10:35.42,"it might be a good idea to look through it, because we know"
148,00:10:38.29,00:10:38.29,James would have had a good idea where the hidden immunity idol
149,00:10:40.62,00:10:40.62,was. I think it's the same thing we
150,00:10:50.71,00:10:50.71,have. Look.
151,00:10:54.21,00:10:54.21,He's got... he's got one in his pant leg.
152,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,>> He's got two? >> Yeah.
153,00:10:58.38,00:10:58.38,He has two of them. >> The first board where the
154,00:11:18.71,00:11:18.71,immunity idol could have been was a blank board.
155,00:11:22.21,00:11:22.21,"Apparently it's missing, because I didn't see it."
156,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,I know that an animal didn't come up and pick it up and take
157,00:11:27.29,00:11:27.29,it away. The other one's filled.
158,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,Does it some more water? >> I'll bring it over.
159,00:11:37.50,00:11:37.50,Let's see. >> I figured Jaime would have
160,00:11:40.25,00:11:40.25,"been looking for it, but there's no way this dummy grabbed the"
161,00:11:42.50,00:11:42.50,"wrong one, because it would have to say ""Immunity"" something on"
162,00:11:45.46,00:11:45.46,it. The thought of this woman having
163,00:11:48.75,00:11:48.75,"a blank one, I would not be able to take it."
164,00:11:51.58,00:11:51.58,I would pass out in pure joy. My head would explode.
165,00:11:55.92,00:11:55.92,"I mean, please, let that happen, please."
166,00:12:00.17,00:12:00.17,That would be the best thing ever.
167,00:12:02.75,00:12:02.75,"That would be the best... that would be the best one ever, if"
168,00:12:07.54,00:12:07.54,"she pulled out a blank thing and was like... ""What do you mean?"
169,00:12:12.17,00:12:12.17,But it don't have no writing on there.
170,00:12:13.46,00:12:13.46,"You at least have to have some... one of these!"""
171,00:12:19.96,00:12:19.96,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Zhan Hu getting your first look"
172,00:12:31.04,00:12:31.04,at the new Fei Long tribe. Sherea voted out at the last
173,00:12:35.17,00:12:35.17,tribal council. Guys ready to get to it?
174,00:12:40.46,00:12:40.46,>> Yes. >> Let's do it.
175,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,>> PROBST: One of the major tenets in The Art of War is to
176,00:12:44.58,00:12:44.58,"know not only yourself, but to know your opponent."
177,00:12:50.08,00:12:50.08,Drop your buffs. You are merged.
178,00:12:52.50,00:12:52.50,">> Oh, my God! >> What?"
179,00:12:56.04,00:12:56.04,">> Hi. >> All right, one big happy"
180,00:12:58.96,00:12:58.96,"family. >> Hi, how are you?"
181,00:13:02.25,00:13:02.25,>> We have merged. So it's pretty exciting.
182,00:13:05.08,00:13:05.08,I really don't know how to take it all in right now.
183,00:13:06.75,00:13:06.75,"It happened so fast. You know, we just have such a"
184,00:13:09.21,00:13:09.21,"wide variety of people, so it's a pretty scary point in the"
185,00:13:11.25,00:13:11.25,game. So I'm excited to have the
186,00:13:13.71,00:13:13.71,hidden immunity idol. That's going to be a whole new

262,00:17:33.04,00:17:33.04,>> I do like my position now. The merge has gotten everybody

265,00:17:41.83,00:17:41.83,though my name was on ballots at the first two tribal councils
266,00:17:44.79,00:17:44.79,"that I was at, I really don't see my name being on a ballot at"
267,00:17:47.29,00:17:47.29,the next council. >> Yeah.

273,00:18:03.54,00:18:03.54,"then as soon as James is gone, we'll have to change the name."
274,00:18:08.46,00:18:08.46,>> That did not just come out of your mouth.

283,00:18:34.08,00:18:34.08,">> I like it. I like ""Black Monsoon,"" because"
284,00:18:35.92,00:18:35.92,we're here during monsoon season.

294,00:19:01.08,00:19:01.08,Zhan Hu. The biggest factor is whether I
295,00:19:04.92,00:19:04.92,have James and whether I have Frosti.
296,00:19:07.67,00:19:07.67,If I can get them both with me on these first two votes...
297,00:19:10.08,00:19:10.08,these first two votes are crucial for me to know whether
298,00:19:12.75,00:19:12.75,I'm going to be in a powerful position or a really sucky
299,00:19:15.04,00:19:15.04,position. >> It is Jeff!

316,00:20:13.83,00:20:13.83,It's something much better than food.
317,00:20:16.04,00:20:16.04,It is a gift for one of you. It is the individual immunity
318,00:20:22.62,00:20:22.62,necklace. >> Wow!

339,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,to how much I could eat. >> PROBST: You guys ready for
340,00:21:54.21,00:21:54.21,"the first question? Here we go, first question: how"
341,00:21:59.21,00:21:59.21,many times during the celebration did firecrackers go
342,00:22:02.88,00:22:02.88,off? Nothing subtle about the
343,00:22:06.17,00:22:06.17,firecrackers when they went off. Everybody reveal.
344,00:22:13.08,00:22:13.08,"Correct answer is three. There's one at the beginning,"
345,00:22:18.25,00:22:18.25,"one during, and one at the end of the feast."
346,00:22:22.67,00:22:22.67,James got it wrong. Amanda got it wrong.
347,00:22:25.04,00:22:25.04,Courtney got it wrong. And Peih-Gee got it wrong.
348,00:22:29.00,00:22:29.00,You are all out of the challenge.
349,00:22:31.08,00:22:31.08,"Todd got it right. Frosti, Jaime, Jean-Robert got"

351,00:22:36.04,00:22:36.04,right. We are down to six.
352,00:22:40.12,00:22:40.12,What was the centerpiece on the table?
353,00:22:44.33,00:22:44.33,Describe it. Tell me what it was.
354,00:22:50.00,00:22:50.00,Everybody reveal. Todd says a dragon.

361,00:23:10.33,00:23:10.33,Dragon is correct. Everybody got it right.
362,00:23:14.12,00:23:14.12,Next question: there was a tall pole with knife blades as ladder
363,00:23:18.96,00:23:18.96,rungs in the middle of the courtyard.
364,00:23:22.50,00:23:22.50,"What color was the pole? One long, tall pole situated in"

366,00:23:33.21,00:23:33.21,"All right, everybody reveal. Todd originally wrote yellow."
367,00:23:36.54,00:23:36.54,He changed it to red. Frosti and Jaime say yellow.
368,00:23:40.38,00:23:40.38,Jean-Robert said red. Denise said red.
369,00:23:43.25,00:23:43.25,Erik said red. Correct answer was yellow.

372,00:23:54.04,00:23:54.04,We are down to Frosti and Jaime. If one of you misses and the
373,00:23:57.96,00:23:57.96,"other gets it right, that person wins individual immunity."
374,00:24:02.79,00:24:02.79,"Next question, immunity on the line: the four cultural dancers"
375,00:24:08.21,00:24:08.21,"with the long, flowing skirts wore what on their feet?"
376,00:24:15.12,00:24:15.12,"The four cultural dancers, they had the long, flowing skirts."
377,00:24:20.33,00:24:20.33,What did they wear on their feet?
378,00:24:23.08,00:24:23.08,">> This is not fair, because I was not looking at their feet."
379,00:24:27.71,00:24:27.71,">> PROBST: All right, reveal. Jaime says silk stockings."
380,00:24:32.42,00:24:32.42,Frosti says nothing. The correct answer is...
381,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,nothing. Frosti wins first individual
382,00:24:42.75,00:24:42.75,"immunity. >> Wow, Frosti."
383,00:24:45.50,00:24:45.50,( applause ) >> PROBST: Come on over.
384,00:24:47.42,00:24:47.42,"Turn around, brother. Congratulations."
385,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,"You're safe at the next tribal council, guaranteed a one in"
386,00:24:54.21,00:24:54.21,"nine shot at a million bucks. For the rest of you, somebody"
387,00:24:58.04,00:24:58.04,"will be going home. For once, you don't have to go"
388,00:25:01.12,00:25:01.12,back to camp. You're already here.
389,00:25:03.29,00:25:03.29,I'll split. I'll see you at tribal council.
390,00:25:05.08,00:25:05.08,Congratulations. >> Damn.
391,00:25:37.04,00:25:37.04,"From now on, we got to go to every tribal."
392,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,>> Huh? >> Now we have to go to every
393,00:25:41.00,00:25:41.00,tribal. The predicament today is that
394,00:25:46.00,00:25:46.00,there's tribal council. There's a big chance that it's
395,00:25:49.17,00:25:49.17,"going to be me, Jaime, or Erik that's going home, since Frosti"
396,00:25:52.62,00:25:52.62,has immunity. And the big question mark is do
397,00:25:55.25,00:25:55.25,we have James's vote? And we don't know if James is on
398,00:25:58.08,00:25:58.08,our side. >> Huh?
399,00:26:03.96,00:26:03.96,Uh-huh. >> This is a huge vote for us
400,00:26:07.42,00:26:07.42,"tonight, because we will know where everybody's loyalties"
401,00:26:09.33,00:26:09.33,"stands. I mean, it's going to be really"
402,00:26:11.08,00:26:11.08,interesting. >> How great would that be?
403,00:26:27.00,00:26:27.00,You've got them both though? >> Yeah.
404,00:26:28.88,00:26:28.88,">> Five, right? Me, you, Amanda, Denise,"
405,00:26:31.46,00:26:31.46,Courtney. >> Yeah.
406,00:26:32.88,00:26:32.88,>> Beautiful. >> Please hold that together.
407,00:26:34.04,00:26:34.04,>> I promise to. I'll shake on it.
408,00:26:36.42,00:26:36.42,">> I mean, you know I can't talk to you that much, especially"
409,00:26:38.12,00:26:38.12,"right now, but I just had to tell somebody."
410,00:26:59.17,00:26:59.17,>> We just have to keep loyal. We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee
411,00:27:02.67,00:27:02.67,and Erik break us up. >> No.
412,00:27:04.88,00:27:04.88,>> I don't think Erik will. Jaime is a silent leader of the
413,00:27:08.29,00:27:08.29,"old Zhan Hu Tribe, definitely. She's really close with Erik,"
414,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,"and by getting rid of Jaime, it'll break up that alliance."
415,00:27:15.08,00:27:15.08,"And Peih-Gee you can just kind of see through, you know."
416,00:27:18.08,00:27:18.08,She's a little devious. But Jaime is so threatening
417,00:27:21.83,00:27:21.83,because people don't see that right away with Jaime.
418,00:27:24.67,00:27:24.67,"Denise is in for sure. Me, you, like, are locked in."
419,00:27:27.50,00:27:27.50,Todd is locked in now. But Courtney kind of has a mind
420,00:27:30.46,00:27:30.46,of her own. Courtney said at tribal council
421,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,she doesn't have anyone here she likes except Sherea.
422,00:27:35.67,00:27:35.67,"She was saying stuff like that. She like, ""Well, you guys keep"
423,00:27:37.79,00:27:37.79,voting off everyone I like. You voted off Leslie.
424,00:27:39.38,00:27:39.38,"You want to vote out Sherea."" I'm like, ""Courtney, this is a"
425,00:27:41.46,00:27:41.46,"game."" >> Well, the problem is Courtney"
426,00:27:46.29,00:27:46.29,keeps getting close to people that we can't have here.
427,00:27:48.38,00:27:48.38,">> I mean, we've done everything so good."
428,00:27:57.54,00:27:57.54,">> I know, I know. >> We've got to watch Courtney"
429,00:28:02.54,00:28:02.54,because she is a loose cannon. She does stray off and fall in
430,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,love with any swinging Dick or Harry that floats and smiles at
431,00:28:07.92,00:28:07.92,"her. But damn, you don't get friends"
432,00:28:10.58,00:28:10.58,on Survivor. This ain't Love Connection.
433,00:28:13.50,00:28:13.50,Ain't nobody trying to get a match or a relationship.
434,00:28:15.92,00:28:15.92,You're supposed to make the strongest team you can and align
435,00:28:18.21,00:28:18.21,with some people you somewhat can trust to win a million
436,00:28:20.21,00:28:20.21,dollars and stop playing around! >> Thank you.
437,00:28:26.21,00:28:26.21,>> It's good. We have every vote from here on
438,00:28:27.96,00:28:27.96,out. >> I know.
439,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,>> Okay? I love it.
440,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,"It will be you, me, and Amanda. >> It's perfect."
441,00:28:32.88,00:28:32.88,>> 100%. >> You know right now it has to
442,00:28:34.62,00:28:34.62,"go Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik. >> I am going to make a"
443,00:28:37.96,00:28:37.96,"suggestion, and hear me out on this."
444,00:28:40.67,00:28:40.67,Everybody on our team already knows Jaime is shady.
445,00:28:44.12,00:28:44.12,"We're already suspicious of her, and nobody's going to trust her."
446,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,Peih-Gee we don't know about because she's just starting to
447,00:28:50.04,00:28:50.04,work her magic. >> Right.
448,00:28:51.79,00:28:51.79,">> Like I said. Today I was, like, surprised."
449,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,She just went and plopped her arm on me.
450,00:28:54.33,00:28:54.33,"I was like, ""You know what? That's kind of cool."
451,00:28:55.71,00:28:55.71,"That's kind of cool."" I was like, ""That's kind of"
452,00:28:57.17,00:28:57.17,cool. This girl's kind of cool.
453,00:28:58.04,00:28:58.04,"This girl's all right."" I don't want her to feel all"
454,00:28:59.54,00:28:59.54,right. >> And she's working her way
455,00:29:00.96,00:29:00.96,with Courtney. >> I don't want to feel all
456,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,right with her in a few days. >> Right.
457,00:29:04.46,00:29:04.46,>> You know? >> So...
458,00:29:08.50,00:29:08.50,">> Oh, one thing also. If somehow you do end up"
459,00:29:12.29,00:29:12.29,"screwing me over, you know, the game or whatever-- and I don't"
460,00:29:15.83,00:29:15.83,"believe that's going to happen, but if I get screwed, I'm going"
461,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,"to hold you responsible, not Amanda."
462,00:29:20.71,00:29:20.71,>> Okay. >> Just so you know.
463,00:29:22.54,00:29:22.54,"And you will never, ever see a juror lobby so hard against"
464,00:29:25.71,00:29:25.71,somebody. You will not win.
465,00:29:27.42,00:29:27.42,">> Okay, okay. >> If I get screwed, it's going"
466,00:29:30.42,00:29:30.42,"to be on you, because I know you have more power than her."
467,00:29:32.62,00:29:32.62,>> Okay. >> Yeah.
468,00:29:34.71,00:29:34.71,It's the three of us. We're going.
469,00:29:37.38,00:29:37.38,>> Good. >> If I didn't agree to all of
470,00:29:41.08,00:29:41.08,"his terms, right away the trust with me and him, he wouldn't"
471,00:29:45.04,00:29:45.04,"trust me anymore, so he would have moved along and found"
472,00:29:46.92,00:29:46.92,another alliance and done who knows what.
473,00:29:49.17,00:29:49.17,"So of course I agreed to it all and was like ""Yeah, we're going"
474,00:29:52.04,00:29:52.04,"to the top three, man. We're going all the way."
475,00:29:54.17,00:29:54.17,"I'm watching your back."" Little does Jean-Robert know..."
476,00:29:56.42,00:29:56.42,"like, little clue, no, he has no idea that I'm ready to... when I"
477,00:29:58.83,00:29:58.83,need to. >> I have no idea.
478,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,Some days I do. Some days I don't.
479,00:30:14.75,00:30:14.75,">> Uh-huh, I'm sure they will. >> Did she?"
480,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,">> Yeah. >> Well, hello."
481,00:30:59.29,00:30:59.29,">> Me and Erik found it, and he has it in his pack."
482,00:31:02.21,00:31:02.21,">> Wait. >> Okay, this... I'll..."
483,00:31:04.62,00:31:04.62,>> How do you know it's the immunity idol?
484,00:31:06.62,00:31:06.62,">> Because there's two sides to the sign, right?"
485,00:31:09.96,00:31:09.96,"We were lying there. One day I was on the bed, and it"
486,00:31:12.00,00:31:12.00,"was just lying on the floor. So I picked it up, and I was"
487,00:31:15.54,00:31:15.54,"like, ""Erik, what is it?"" We're like, ""I don't know."""
488,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,"So he put it in his bag. Well, then the next day, we"
489,00:31:20.62,00:31:20.62,found two of them in James's bag.
490,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,"So we're like, ""He must have got spooked by us and dropped it."""
491,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,And we picked it up and put it in our possession.
492,00:31:32.38,00:31:32.38,"We're thinking we'll play it tonight anyway, no matter what."
493,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,">> Uh-huh. >> If they're all voting for me,"
494,00:31:37.33,00:31:37.33,"and I have the idol, then the only votes that count are ours,"
495,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,so Jean-Robert will be voted out instead.
496,00:31:43.46,00:31:43.46,So we might as well try and use it tonight.
497,00:31:45.88,00:31:45.88,>> Jaime came up to me with Erik and said that she had found
498,00:31:48.67,00:31:48.67,something that she thought was an idol.
499,00:31:51.21,00:31:51.21,"Now, I've seen the actual idol from the Fei Long camp."
500,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,"And what she's describing is similar, so there is a"
501,00:31:59.04,00:31:59.04,possibility that she has one. The worst that would happen
502,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,would be that Jean-Robert would end up going home if she knew to
503,00:32:04.29,00:32:04.29,play it. And now that I've won the
504,00:32:06.92,00:32:06.92,"immunity idol, I'm in a safe place, and both tribes think"
505,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,that I'm with them. So I could easily be considered
506,00:32:12.88,00:32:12.88,"a swing vote, and I could go either way."
507,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,>> What are you thinking? >> Do you know anything about
508,00:32:21.50,00:32:21.50,"the immunity idol over here? >> Well, I know a little, but"
509,00:32:24.58,00:32:24.58,not much. >> Okay.
510,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,"If you can somehow just keep me here tonight, I think I know who"
511,00:32:30.92,00:32:30.92,"has your immunity idol, and I know who has mine."
512,00:32:34.67,00:32:34.67,>> Do you know who has them both?
513,00:32:36.58,00:32:36.58,>> I do. >> Okay.
514,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,>> And I'll tell you tomorrow if you can keep me around.
515,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,">> And you know, I acted all interested when Jaime told me"
516,00:32:43.04,00:32:43.04,that she knew who had the hidden immunity idols and that she was
517,00:32:45.71,00:32:45.71,"going to tell me, but she made it sound like someone from their"
518,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,tribe has one and someone from our tribe has one.
519,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,"Wow, does she have to catch up. So... she's... she's on the"
520,00:32:57.12,00:32:57.12,"small bike in the back, you know, just pedaling as fast as"
521,00:32:59.83,00:32:59.83,she can. How did you find out who got
522,00:33:01.50,00:33:01.50,"ours? >> Um, long story."
523,00:33:06.25,00:33:06.25,"I'll explain it, everything, but..."
524,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,">> Okay, okay. >> I've come to realize that I'm"
525,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,"very good at playing stupid, and it works to my advantage, so I"
526,00:33:12.29,00:33:12.29,think I'm just going to stick on with it.
527,00:33:14.54,00:33:14.54,"As far as the other tribe's concerned, I think they kind of"
528,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,think I'm little Jessica Simpson out here running around in the
529,00:33:18.38,00:33:18.38,jungle. If Todd sees me play the hidden
530,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,"immunity idol tonight, he's definitely going to be floored"
531,00:33:25.96,00:33:25.96,when he sees it come out. I think it's probably going to
532,00:33:28.00,00:33:28.00,"shock everyone, including Jeff. I'm not as dumb as I look, and"
533,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,"maybe they're figuring it out. >> Dude, I'm telling you, it has"
534,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00,to go Peih-Gee and then Jaime. >> I don't want any dissension
535,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,"amongst us until we get to the final six, until all of them are"
536,00:33:43.58,00:33:43.58,gone. Then we can act as much as a
537,00:33:45.92,00:33:45.92,fool as we want. >> It's Peih-Gee.
538,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,>> We can't screw this up. >> I'm telling you it's done.
539,00:33:50.21,00:33:50.21,">> There should be no mistaking. >> I'm just telling you 100%,"
540,00:33:52.46,00:33:52.46,"that's where I'm going. >> No, don't say that."
541,00:33:55.42,00:33:55.42,"We're going to pick who it is, and we're sticking together."
542,00:33:57.79,00:33:57.79,">> It's Peih-Gee. Okay, yes, we are."
543,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,">> Jean-Robert probably would go home tonight, because Jean-"
544,00:34:01.42,00:34:01.42,Robert is stupid. >> This girl is the enemy.
545,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,This girl is the devil! This girl is the devil!
546,00:34:08.25,00:34:08.25,>> The best scenario is for the Fei Long Tribe to stick together
547,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,"and vote off the Zhan Hu Tribe, but Jean-Robert's dumb ass is"
548,00:34:15.83,00:34:15.83,"going to vote for Peih-Gee, even though we all said Jaime."
549,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,It's been Jaime for a month now. The Zhan Hu people naturally are
550,00:34:23.79,00:34:23.79,going to vote for Jean-Robert. They know he's the easy win.
551,00:34:26.00,00:34:26.00,And lord help him if Courtney's dumb ass decides to vote for
552,00:34:28.71,00:34:28.71,Jean-Robert out of pure spite because she just wants to be
553,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,hateful. >> PROBST: Full house.
554,00:34:59.79,00:34:59.79,"Amanda, from a game point of view, how did the merge change"
555,00:35:02.71,00:35:02.71,"the game? >> Well, Jeff, it's kind of"
556,00:35:05.54,00:35:05.54,"nice, actually, because we spent a lot of time as, like, Fei"
557,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,"Long, wondering what the other tribe was doing."
558,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,"So it's kind of nice to have some new people around, and we"
559,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,all get along really well. We're having a lot of fun.
560,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when you hear Amanda say it's fun, does"
561,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,that make you think she has no clue what this game is about or
562,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,that she's extremely confident that she's not going anywhere?
563,00:35:25.58,00:35:25.58,">> Well, of course, I mean, they have higher numbers."
564,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,So I'm sure it's easier for them to have fun.
565,00:35:32.08,00:35:32.08,">> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you're a student of people."
566,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,Have you noticed a shift in how people are operating?
567,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,>> It's so interesting how the dynamic changed from the team
568,00:35:41.21,00:35:41.21,now to the individual. Now that we're in the individual
569,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,"situation, I very much see Courtney making it down to the"
570,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,"bottom two, bottom three, because she's not going to be"
571,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,perceived as the type of threat that James or myself might be.
572,00:35:53.62,00:35:53.62,So now she's somebody that nobody's going to be gunning for
573,00:35:56.83,00:35:56.83,for a while. I don't see her name showing up
574,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"on a ballot for a long time. >> PROBST: Courtney, you're"
575,00:36:01.58,00:36:01.58,rolling your eyes. Why?
576,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,">> Because this is now Jean- Robert trying to be like, ""The"
577,00:36:06.71,00:36:06.71,biggest threat in the room is the little blonde!
578,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,"Come on, everyone!"" It's a person who I don't get"
579,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,along with pointing out that all of a sudden I'm going to be the
580,00:36:14.08,00:36:14.08,biggest threat there is. It's just... it's funny.
581,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,>> I didn't say she's going to be the biggest threat.
582,00:36:18.46,00:36:18.46,I said that it's likely she's going to get the furthest.
583,00:36:20.12,00:36:20.12,">> Which translates to ""You're a big threat."""
584,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,>> I don't think it does. It means that you're not a
585,00:36:24.12,00:36:24.12,threat. And the same is true for several
586,00:36:26.88,00:36:26.88,"people in this group. >> PROBST: James, why does that"
587,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"bother you? >> Jean-Robert, he just don't be"
588,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,quiet. I don't know.
589,00:36:33.46,00:36:33.46,He just don't stop. >> PROBST: And you think that
590,00:36:35.54,00:36:35.54,"that might become a liability? >> Yeah, he puts his name on the"
591,00:36:38.50,00:36:38.50,"chopping block because he's always saying, ""Oh, well, I'm"
592,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,"going on the chopping block today."""
593,00:36:41.92,00:36:41.92,"He'll mention it every day. When he's tired, he'll announce"
594,00:36:44.29,00:36:44.29,that he's tired. He doesn't have to do that.
595,00:36:46.21,00:36:46.21,"See, when you're tired, just go lay down."
596,00:36:47.83,00:36:47.83,We understand. You're a card player.
597,00:36:49.21,00:36:49.21,You haven't been in the sun. You're used to people bringing
598,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,"the food up to you, probably putting it in your mouth and"
599,00:36:53.50,00:36:53.50,"helping you chew. You know, we don't expect that"
600,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,much from you. So you don't have to go on and
601,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,"on about it, which I guess is part of his tactic."
602,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,"But I'm like, ""Dude, you don't have to talk that much."""
603,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when you guys all merged together, did"
604,00:37:05.21,00:37:05.21,you try to find cracks in the Fei Long group?
605,00:37:08.62,00:37:08.62,>> You kind of know about some of the cracks already.
606,00:37:11.12,00:37:11.12,We've had spies back and forth. I know Jean-Robert's name has
607,00:37:14.92,00:37:14.92,come up quite a bit. He's politicking his ass off.
608,00:37:18.88,00:37:18.88,He's doing everything he can to ensure that he's got as many
609,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,"votes on the jury as possible. >> PROBST: Jaime, what do you"
610,00:37:25.54,00:37:25.54,think the key is to getting the attention off you?
611,00:37:28.08,00:37:28.08,"If you hear that your name is on the block, what should you do?"
612,00:37:31.92,00:37:31.92,">> You know, I just kind of wanted to come in here and talk"
613,00:37:34.04,00:37:34.04,"to the Fei Long members, just in case there was a crack, just in"
614,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,case there was someone on that team that they just can't stand
615,00:37:38.46,00:37:38.46,enough that they would be happy to get rid of.
616,00:37:40.71,00:37:40.71,"You know, it just would take one other person to be like, ""I"
617,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,"really can't stand this person anymore; I want them to go home,"
618,00:37:44.96,00:37:44.96,"and Jaime is more pleasant to be around, so..."""
619,00:37:47.50,00:37:47.50,">> PROBST: All right, Frosti has the immunity necklace."
620,00:37:50.08,00:37:50.08,I know you're not giving it up. You cannot vote for Frosti.
621,00:37:54.21,00:37:54.21,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
622,00:37:56.67,00:37:56.67,"Erik, you're up. >> Trying to keep it Zhan Hu."
623,00:38:53.08,00:38:53.08,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
624,00:39:09.83,00:39:09.83,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
625,00:39:11.46,00:39:11.46,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
626,00:39:13.08,00:39:13.08,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
627,00:39:16.04,00:39:16.04,">> Jeff, I have a question for you."
628,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,>> PROBST: Yes. >> I found this at camp lying on
629,00:39:22.04,00:39:22.04,"the floor, so I thought it might be immunity."
630,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,>> PROBST: Thanks. The rules of Survivor state that
631,00:39:41.25,00:39:41.25,"if the hidden immunity idol is played, any votes cast against"
632,00:39:44.92,00:39:44.92,"that person will not count, and the person with the next highest"
633,00:39:48.00,00:39:48.00,number of votes be will be sent home.
634,00:39:50.42,00:39:50.42,That's in the case of a hidden immunity idol being played.
635,00:39:53.54,00:39:53.54,"This, however, is not a hidden immunity idol."
636,00:40:01.92,00:40:01.92,">> Oh, my gosh! ( laughter )"
637,00:40:05.21,00:40:05.21,"Oh, oh! >> PROBST: Any votes cast"
638,00:40:08.67,00:40:08.67,against Jaime will count. I'll now read the votes.
639,00:40:13.62,00:40:13.62,"First vote, Jean-Robert. Jaime."
640,00:40:23.12,00:40:23.12,"Jaime. Two votes Jaime, one vote Jean-"
641,00:40:25.79,00:40:25.79,Robert. Jean-Robert.
642,00:40:30.58,00:40:30.58,"We're tied, two votes Jaime, two votes Jean-Robert."
643,00:40:35.25,00:40:35.25,"Jean-Robert. That's three votes Jean-Robert,"
644,00:40:37.92,00:40:37.92,two votes Jaime. Jaime.
645,00:40:43.96,00:40:43.96,"Tied again, three votes Jaime, three votes Jean-Robert."
646,00:40:50.46,00:40:50.46,"Jaime. Four votes Jaime, three votes"
647,00:40:52.46,00:40:52.46,Jean-Robert. Jaime.
648,00:40:58.58,00:40:58.58,"That's five votes Jaime, three votes Jean-Robert."
649,00:41:03.46,00:41:03.46,Seventh person voted out of Survivor: China and the first
650,00:41:05.71,00:41:05.71,"member of our jury, Jaime. That's six."
651,00:41:08.75,00:41:08.75,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
652,00:41:20.04,00:41:20.04,"Jaime, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
653,00:41:34.29,00:41:34.29,"Well, the game has just shifted again."
654,00:41:36.42,00:41:36.42,"With Jaime becoming the first member of the jury, you are now"
655,00:41:38.83,00:41:38.83,voting people out of the game who will ultimately decide who
656,00:41:42.17,00:41:42.17,they feel is most deserving of the title of sole survivor and
657,00:41:45.46,00:41:45.46,the million dollars that goes with it.
658,00:41:48.04,00:41:48.04,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

664,00:42:12.42,00:42:12.42,Survivor... >> I would love to see some
665,00:42:14.42,00:42:14.42,craziness. >> PROBST: ...Todd wants to
666,00:42:17.08,00:42:17.08,"blindside James. >> If we blindside him, both"
667,00:42:19.50,00:42:19.50,immunities would be out of play. >> PROBST: ...causing his
668,00:42:21.79,00:42:21.79,alliance to question his leadership.
669,00:42:23.58,00:42:23.58,>> Todd is all over the place right now.

672,00:42:29.21,00:42:29.21,I'll try anything at this point. >> I learned that I'm probably
673,00:42:38.67,00:42:38.67,too nice for the game of Survivor.
674,00:42:40.62,00:42:40.62,I wish Erik and Peih-Gee the best of luck.
675,00:42:43.08,00:42:43.08,I made a bad decision with James.
676,00:42:46.08,00:42:46.08,"He's obviously not very trustworthy, and I hate that I"
677,00:42:48.62,00:42:48.62,trusted him. I'm kicking myself in the butt
678,00:42:50.50,00:42:50.50,right now. I tried to plain the hidden
679,00:42:52.21,00:42:52.21,"immunity idol. It wasn't it, but it was worth a"
680,00:42:54.25,00:42:54.25,"shot, so I'm glad I tried it."
