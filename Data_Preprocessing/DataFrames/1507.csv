16,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,"for him, but he uses the idol toget rid of Jaime."

43,00:02:06.17,00:02:06.17,Who will be voted out tonight?>> That was a little bit of a
44,00:02:19.58,00:02:19.58,surprise.I didn't even know there was
45,00:02:21.12,00:02:21.12,"that kind of tension.>> I promise you, Amanda, if"
46,00:02:30.42,00:02:30.42,"somebody did that to you, you'dbe a little bit upset about it"
47,00:02:32.50,00:02:32.50,"too.>> I personally, Jean-Robert,"

56,00:02:59.62,00:02:59.62,"my friends-- like, ""friends""--Todd and Amanda."
57,00:03:03.21,00:03:03.21,I don't feel like I really needto be anybody's friend in this
58,00:03:05.12,00:03:05.12,game.I dislike everyone else more
59,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,than I dislike Todd and Amanda.I think they mistake that for

66,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,>> Let you down how?>> Just stick with us.

68,00:04:53.62,00:04:53.62,we basically sacrificed one ofour old tribe mates for you.

74,00:05:08.46,00:05:08.46,think you deserve it.I really like James personally.
75,00:05:11.67,00:05:11.67,I do-- whether he's a reallygood con man or he is exactly
76,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,"how he puts himself out to be.From what I've seen so far, my"
77,00:05:19.29,00:05:19.29,"gut instinct is to trust James.>> I was kidnapped, so, you"
78,00:05:54.33,00:05:54.33,"know, I got the clue for theidols."
79,00:05:56.04,00:05:56.04,I wasn't going to do like Todddid and be impatient.
80,00:05:58.42,00:05:58.42,There are so many times whenyou're by yourself.
81,00:06:07.83,00:06:07.83,I picked off one.It was the wrong one.
82,00:06:09.67,00:06:09.67,It was a blank sheet of wood.So I hurried and picked off the
83,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,second one.I kind of had to hustle off to
84,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,my bag and hide it.Did y'all get anything?
85,00:06:30.21,00:06:30.21,">> We didn't rack up, but we gota decent amount."
86,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,">> So I have it now.I have it in my position, and I"
87,00:06:36.04,00:06:36.04,have the two idols.That's funny.
88,00:06:38.79,00:06:38.79,I'm on Survivor with two idols.>> Yeah.
89,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,">> Yes, it is.>> This morning, I slept in."
90,00:07:01.67,00:07:01.67,I was in a good mood.And Courtney comes up and sits

92,00:07:07.25,00:07:07.25,"We all kind of look at her like,""Uh, are you okay, Courtney?"""

103,00:07:33.38,00:07:33.38,"that, Courtney, and I would loveto stand up for you."
104,00:07:36.25,00:07:36.25,">> You don't have to evenstand... just, like, don't"
105,00:07:38.21,00:07:38.21,"pander to him and say, ""You havea point, Jean-Robert."""

114,00:07:57.04,00:07:57.04,"Like, the three of you can...>> Courtney, you are right."
115,00:07:58.92,00:07:58.92,>> All right.You know...
116,00:08:00.67,00:08:00.67,>> It does worry me thatCourtney will continue to vote
117,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,"for Jean-Robert every singletime, because all the other"
118,00:08:07.46,00:08:07.46,"tribe, if there is a merge,needs to know that one person is"
119,00:08:10.21,00:08:10.21,"voting against Jean-Robert, andthey will automatically have"
120,00:08:13.21,00:08:13.21,"Jaime, Peih-Gee, and Erik withCourtney voting against Jean-"
121,00:08:16.38,00:08:16.38,"Robert, and that's a campaign toget him off, which is losing one"
122,00:08:19.42,00:08:19.42,of our numbers.Can we patch things up between
123,00:08:21.42,00:08:21.42,us instead of having hardfeelings like that?
124,00:08:23.83,00:08:23.83,">> What difference does it make?>> It makes a big difference,"
125,00:08:26.92,00:08:26.92,Courtney.>> What does she want?
126,00:08:36.29,00:08:36.29,"Like, what does she expect fromme?"
127,00:08:38.17,00:08:38.17,"Right now I need my numbers, andJean-Robert is one of my"
128,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83,"numbers.Deal with it, bitch."
129,00:09:20.92,00:09:20.92,">> This used to be hanging onthe archway, and it looks like"
130,00:09:24.17,00:09:24.17,"someone took it off.I don't know if it was James,"
131,00:09:28.12,00:09:28.12,because James now knows thatthere's a hidden immunity idol
132,00:09:30.12,00:09:30.12,as well.I don't know if he knows where
133,00:09:32.21,00:09:32.21,"it is or what it is, but youknow, it looks idol-ish."
134,00:09:39.04,00:09:39.04,Peih-Gee didn't really thinkmuch of it.
135,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,She doesn't know there's ahidden idol yet.
136,00:09:41.96,00:09:41.96,"So Peih-Gee left.I just was like, ""Well, I guess"
137,00:09:44.54,00:09:44.54,"I'll grab it,"" and put it in mybag."
138,00:09:49.54,00:09:49.54,">> It could definitely say,like, ""Immunity idol"" in"
139,00:09:51.50,00:09:51.50,"Chinese, and I'd have no idea.It's a weird symbol, so I don't"
140,00:09:53.92,00:09:53.92,know what it stands for.I just want to look in his bag.
141,00:10:06.42,00:10:06.42,Do you think he'll see me if Ipull it out?
142,00:10:19.92,00:10:19.92,I knew it.He has one in here.
143,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,"Hey, you watch over there.Make sure they're not coming"
144,00:10:25.67,00:10:25.67,back.Peih-Gee and James went off to
145,00:10:31.21,00:10:31.21,"go frog hunting, so I saw James'bag sitting there, and I figured"
146,00:10:35.42,00:10:35.42,"it might be a good idea to lookthrough it, because we know"
147,00:10:38.29,00:10:38.29,James would have had a good ideawhere the hidden immunity idol
148,00:10:40.62,00:10:40.62,was.I think it's the same thing we
149,00:10:50.71,00:10:50.71,have.Look.
150,00:10:54.21,00:10:54.21,He's got... he's got one in hispant leg.
151,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,>> He's got two?>> Yeah.
152,00:10:58.38,00:10:58.38,He has two of them.>> The first board where the
153,00:11:18.71,00:11:18.71,immunity idol could have beenwas a blank board.
154,00:11:22.21,00:11:22.21,"Apparently it's missing, becauseI didn't see it."
155,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,I know that an animal didn'tcome up and pick it up and take
156,00:11:27.29,00:11:27.29,it away.The other one's filled.
157,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,Does it some more water?>> I'll bring it over.
158,00:11:37.50,00:11:37.50,Let's see.>> I figured Jaime would have
159,00:11:40.25,00:11:40.25,"been looking for it, but there'sno way this dummy grabbed the"
160,00:11:42.50,00:11:42.50,"wrong one, because it would haveto say ""Immunity"" something on"
161,00:11:45.46,00:11:45.46,it.The thought of this woman having
162,00:11:48.75,00:11:48.75,"a blank one, I would not be ableto take it."
163,00:11:51.58,00:11:51.58,I would pass out in pure joy.My head would explode.

165,00:12:00.17,00:12:00.17,That would be the best thingever.

377,00:24:23.08,00:24:23.08,">> This is not fair, because Iwas not looking at their feet."
378,00:24:27.71,00:24:27.71,">> PROBST: All right, reveal.Jaime says silk stockings."
379,00:24:32.42,00:24:32.42,Frosti says nothing.The correct answer is...
380,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,nothing.Frosti wins first individual
381,00:24:42.75,00:24:42.75,"immunity.>> Wow, Frosti."
382,00:24:45.50,00:24:45.50,( applause )>> PROBST: Come on over.
383,00:24:47.42,00:24:47.42,"Turn around, brother.Congratulations."
384,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,"You're safe at the next tribalcouncil, guaranteed a one in"
385,00:24:54.21,00:24:54.21,"nine shot at a million bucks.For the rest of you, somebody"
386,00:24:58.04,00:24:58.04,"will be going home.For once, you don't have to go"
387,00:25:01.12,00:25:01.12,back to camp.You're already here.
388,00:25:03.29,00:25:03.29,I'll split.I'll see you at tribal council.
389,00:25:05.08,00:25:05.08,Congratulations.>> Damn.
390,00:25:37.04,00:25:37.04,"From now on, we got to go toevery tribal."
391,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,>> Huh?>> Now we have to go to every
392,00:25:41.00,00:25:41.00,tribal.The predicament today is that
393,00:25:46.00,00:25:46.00,there's tribal council.There's a big chance that it's
394,00:25:49.17,00:25:49.17,"going to be me, Jaime, or Erikthat's going home, since Frosti"
395,00:25:52.62,00:25:52.62,has immunity.And the big question mark is do
396,00:25:55.25,00:25:55.25,we have James's vote?And we don't know if James is on
397,00:25:58.08,00:25:58.08,our side.>> Huh?
398,00:26:03.96,00:26:03.96,Uh-huh.>> This is a huge vote for us
399,00:26:07.42,00:26:07.42,"tonight, because we will knowwhere everybody's loyalties"
400,00:26:09.33,00:26:09.33,"stands.I mean, it's going to be really"
401,00:26:11.08,00:26:11.08,interesting.>> How great would that be?
402,00:26:27.00,00:26:27.00,You've got them both though?>> Yeah.
403,00:26:28.88,00:26:28.88,">> Five, right?Me, you, Amanda, Denise,"
404,00:26:31.46,00:26:31.46,Courtney.>> Yeah.
405,00:26:32.88,00:26:32.88,>> Beautiful.>> Please hold that together.
406,00:26:34.04,00:26:34.04,>> I promise to.I'll shake on it.
407,00:26:36.42,00:26:36.42,">> I mean, you know I can't talkto you that much, especially"
408,00:26:38.12,00:26:38.12,"right now, but I just had totell somebody."
409,00:26:59.17,00:26:59.17,>> We just have to keep loyal.We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee
410,00:27:02.67,00:27:02.67,and Erik break us up.>> No.
411,00:27:04.88,00:27:04.88,>> I don't think Erik will.Jaime is a silent leader of the
412,00:27:08.29,00:27:08.29,"old Zhan Hu Tribe, definitely.She's really close with Erik,"
413,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,"and by getting rid of Jaime,it'll break up that alliance."
414,00:27:15.08,00:27:15.08,"And Peih-Gee you can just kindof see through, you know."
415,00:27:18.08,00:27:18.08,She's a little devious.But Jaime is so threatening
416,00:27:21.83,00:27:21.83,because people don't see thatright away with Jaime.
417,00:27:24.67,00:27:24.67,"Denise is in for sure.Me, you, like, are locked in."
418,00:27:27.50,00:27:27.50,Todd is locked in now.But Courtney kind of has a mind
419,00:27:30.46,00:27:30.46,of her own.Courtney said at tribal council
420,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,she doesn't have anyone here shelikes except Sherea.
421,00:27:35.67,00:27:35.67,"She was saying stuff like that.She like, ""Well, you guys keep"
422,00:27:37.79,00:27:37.79,voting off everyone I like.You voted off Leslie.
423,00:27:39.38,00:27:39.38,"You want to vote out Sherea.""I'm like, ""Courtney, this is a"
424,00:27:41.46,00:27:41.46,"game."">> Well, the problem is Courtney"
425,00:27:46.29,00:27:46.29,keeps getting close to peoplethat we can't have here.
426,00:27:48.38,00:27:48.38,">> I mean, we've done everythingso good."
427,00:27:57.54,00:27:57.54,">> I know, I know.>> We've got to watch Courtney"
428,00:28:02.54,00:28:02.54,because she is a loose cannon.She does stray off and fall in
429,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,love with any swinging Dick orHarry that floats and smiles at
430,00:28:07.92,00:28:07.92,"her.But damn, you don't get friends"
431,00:28:10.58,00:28:10.58,on Survivor.This ain't Love Connection.
432,00:28:13.50,00:28:13.50,Ain't nobody trying to get amatch or a relationship.
433,00:28:15.92,00:28:15.92,You're supposed to make thestrongest team you can and align
434,00:28:18.21,00:28:18.21,with some people you somewhatcan trust to win a million
435,00:28:20.21,00:28:20.21,dollars and stop playing around!>> Thank you.
436,00:28:26.21,00:28:26.21,>> It's good.We have every vote from here on
437,00:28:27.96,00:28:27.96,out.>> I know.
438,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,>> Okay?I love it.
439,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,"It will be you, me, and Amanda.>> It's perfect."
440,00:28:32.88,00:28:32.88,>> 100%.>> You know right now it has to
441,00:28:34.62,00:28:34.62,"go Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik.>> I am going to make a"
442,00:28:37.96,00:28:37.96,"suggestion, and hear me out onthis."
443,00:28:40.67,00:28:40.67,Everybody on our team alreadyknows Jaime is shady.
444,00:28:44.12,00:28:44.12,"We're already suspicious of her,and nobody's going to trust her."
445,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,Peih-Gee we don't know aboutbecause she's just starting to
446,00:28:50.04,00:28:50.04,work her magic.>> Right.
447,00:28:51.79,00:28:51.79,">> Like I said.Today I was, like, surprised."
448,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,She just went and plopped herarm on me.
449,00:28:54.33,00:28:54.33,"I was like, ""You know what?That's kind of cool."
450,00:28:55.71,00:28:55.71,"That's kind of cool.""I was like, ""That's kind of"
451,00:28:57.17,00:28:57.17,cool.This girl's kind of cool.
452,00:28:58.04,00:28:58.04,"This girl's all right.""I don't want her to feel all"
453,00:28:59.54,00:28:59.54,right.>> And she's working her way
454,00:29:00.96,00:29:00.96,with Courtney.>> I don't want to feel all
455,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,right with her in a few days.>> Right.
456,00:29:04.46,00:29:04.46,>> You know?>> So...
457,00:29:08.50,00:29:08.50,">> Oh, one thing also.If somehow you do end up"
458,00:29:12.29,00:29:12.29,"screwing me over, you know, thegame or whatever-- and I don't"
459,00:29:15.83,00:29:15.83,"believe that's going to happen,but if I get screwed, I'm going"
460,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,"to hold you responsible, notAmanda."
461,00:29:20.71,00:29:20.71,>> Okay.>> Just so you know.
462,00:29:22.54,00:29:22.54,"And you will never, ever see ajuror lobby so hard against"
463,00:29:25.71,00:29:25.71,somebody.You will not win.
464,00:29:27.42,00:29:27.42,">> Okay, okay.>> If I get screwed, it's going"
465,00:29:30.42,00:29:30.42,"to be on you, because I know youhave more power than her."
466,00:29:32.62,00:29:32.62,>> Okay.>> Yeah.
467,00:29:34.71,00:29:34.71,It's the three of us.We're going.
468,00:29:37.38,00:29:37.38,>> Good.>> If I didn't agree to all of
469,00:29:41.08,00:29:41.08,"his terms, right away the trustwith me and him, he wouldn't"
470,00:29:45.04,00:29:45.04,"trust me anymore, so he wouldhave moved along and found"
471,00:29:46.92,00:29:46.92,another alliance and done whoknows what.
472,00:29:49.17,00:29:49.17,"So of course I agreed to it alland was like ""Yeah, we're going"
473,00:29:52.04,00:29:52.04,"to the top three, man.We're going all the way."
474,00:29:54.17,00:29:54.17,"I'm watching your back.""Little does Jean-Robert know..."
475,00:29:56.42,00:29:56.42,"like, little clue, no, he has noidea that I'm ready to... when I"
476,00:29:58.83,00:29:58.83,need to.>> I have no idea.
477,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,Some days I do.Some days I don't.
478,00:30:14.75,00:30:14.75,">> Uh-huh, I'm sure they will.>> Did she?"
479,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,">> Yeah.>> Well, hello."
480,00:30:59.29,00:30:59.29,">> Me and Erik found it, and hehas it in his pack."
481,00:31:02.21,00:31:02.21,">> Wait.>> Okay, this... I'll..."
482,00:31:04.62,00:31:04.62,>> How do you know it's theimmunity idol?
483,00:31:06.62,00:31:06.62,">> Because there's two sides tothe sign, right?"
484,00:31:09.96,00:31:09.96,"We were lying there.One day I was on the bed, and it"
485,00:31:12.00,00:31:12.00,"was just lying on the floor.So I picked it up, and I was"
486,00:31:15.54,00:31:15.54,"like, ""Erik, what is it?""We're like, ""I don't know."""
487,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,"So he put it in his bag.Well, then the next day, we"
488,00:31:20.62,00:31:20.62,found two of them in James'sbag.
489,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,"So we're like, ""He must have gotspooked by us and dropped it."""
490,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,And we picked it up and put itin our possession.
491,00:31:32.38,00:31:32.38,"We're thinking we'll play ittonight anyway, no matter what."
492,00:31:34.79,00:31:34.79,">> Uh-huh.>> If they're all voting for me,"
493,00:31:37.33,00:31:37.33,"and I have the idol, then theonly votes that count are ours,"
494,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,so Jean-Robert will be voted outinstead.
495,00:31:43.46,00:31:43.46,So we might as well try and useit tonight.
496,00:31:45.88,00:31:45.88,>> Jaime came up to me with Erikand said that she had found
497,00:31:48.67,00:31:48.67,something that she thought wasan idol.
498,00:31:51.21,00:31:51.21,"Now, I've seen the actual idolfrom the Fei Long camp."
499,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,"And what she's describing issimilar, so there is a"
500,00:31:59.04,00:31:59.04,possibility that she has one.The worst that would happen
501,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,would be that Jean-Robert wouldend up going home if she knew to
502,00:32:04.29,00:32:04.29,play it.And now that I've won the
503,00:32:06.92,00:32:06.92,"immunity idol, I'm in a safeplace, and both tribes think"
504,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,that I'm with them.So I could easily be considered
505,00:32:12.88,00:32:12.88,"a swing vote, and I could goeither way."
506,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,>> What are you thinking?>> Do you know anything about
507,00:32:21.50,00:32:21.50,"the immunity idol over here?>> Well, I know a little, but"
508,00:32:24.58,00:32:24.58,not much.>> Okay.
509,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,"If you can somehow just keep mehere tonight, I think I know who"
510,00:32:30.92,00:32:30.92,"has your immunity idol, and Iknow who has mine."
511,00:32:34.67,00:32:34.67,>> Do you know who has themboth?
512,00:32:36.58,00:32:36.58,>> I do.>> Okay.
513,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,>> And I'll tell you tomorrow ifyou can keep me around.
514,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,">> And you know, I acted allinterested when Jaime told me"
515,00:32:43.04,00:32:43.04,that she knew who had the hiddenimmunity idols and that she was
516,00:32:45.71,00:32:45.71,"going to tell me, but she madeit sound like someone from their"
517,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,tribe has one and someone fromour tribe has one.
518,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,"Wow, does she have to catch up.So... she's... she's on the"
519,00:32:57.12,00:32:57.12,"small bike in the back, youknow, just pedaling as fast as"
520,00:32:59.83,00:32:59.83,she can.How did you find out who got
521,00:33:01.50,00:33:01.50,"ours?>> Um, long story."
522,00:33:06.25,00:33:06.25,"I'll explain it, everything,but..."
523,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,">> Okay, okay.>> I've come to realize that I'm"
524,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,"very good at playing stupid, andit works to my advantage, so I"
525,00:33:12.29,00:33:12.29,think I'm just going to stick onwith it.
526,00:33:14.54,00:33:14.54,"As far as the other tribe'sconcerned, I think they kind of"
527,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,think I'm little Jessica Simpsonout here running around in the
528,00:33:18.38,00:33:18.38,jungle.If Todd sees me play the hidden
529,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,"immunity idol tonight, he'sdefinitely going to be floored"
530,00:33:25.96,00:33:25.96,when he sees it come out.I think it's probably going to
531,00:33:28.00,00:33:28.00,"shock everyone, including Jeff.I'm not as dumb as I look, and"
532,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,"maybe they're figuring it out.>> Dude, I'm telling you, it has"
533,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00,to go Peih-Gee and then Jaime.>> I don't want any dissension

537,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,>> We can't screw this up.>> I'm telling you it's done.

539,00:33:52.46,00:33:52.46,"that's where I'm going.>> No, don't say that."
540,00:33:55.42,00:33:55.42,"We're going to pick who it is,and we're sticking together."
541,00:33:57.79,00:33:57.79,">> It's Peih-Gee.Okay, yes, we are."
542,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,">> Jean-Robert probably would gohome tonight, because Jean-"

559,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when youhear Amanda say it's fun, does"
560,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,that make you think she has noclue what this game is about or
561,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,that she's extremely confidentthat she's not going anywhere?
562,00:35:25.58,00:35:25.58,">> Well, of course, I mean, theyhave higher numbers."
563,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,So I'm sure it's easier for themto have fun.
564,00:35:32.08,00:35:32.08,">> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you're astudent of people."
565,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,Have you noticed a shift in howpeople are operating?
566,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,>> It's so interesting how thedynamic changed from the team
567,00:35:41.21,00:35:41.21,now to the individual.Now that we're in the individual
568,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,"situation, I very much seeCourtney making it down to the"
569,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,"bottom two, bottom three,because she's not going to be"
570,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,perceived as the type of threatthat James or myself might be.
571,00:35:53.62,00:35:53.62,So now she's somebody thatnobody's going to be gunning for
572,00:35:56.83,00:35:56.83,for a while.I don't see her name showing up
573,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"on a ballot for a long time.>> PROBST: Courtney, you're"
574,00:36:01.58,00:36:01.58,rolling your eyes.Why?
575,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,">> Because this is now Jean-Robert trying to be like, ""The"
576,00:36:06.71,00:36:06.71,biggest threat in the room isthe little blonde!
577,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,"Come on, everyone!""It's a person who I don't get"
578,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,along with pointing out that allof a sudden I'm going to be the
579,00:36:14.08,00:36:14.08,biggest threat there is.It's just... it's funny.
580,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,>> I didn't say she's going tobe the biggest threat.
581,00:36:18.46,00:36:18.46,I said that it's likely she'sgoing to get the furthest.
582,00:36:20.12,00:36:20.12,">> Which translates to ""You're abig threat."""
583,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,>> I don't think it does.It means that you're not a
584,00:36:24.12,00:36:24.12,threat.And the same is true for several
585,00:36:26.88,00:36:26.88,"people in this group.>> PROBST: James, why does that"
586,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"bother you?>> Jean-Robert, he just don't be"
587,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,quiet.I don't know.
588,00:36:33.46,00:36:33.46,He just don't stop.>> PROBST: And you think that
589,00:36:35.54,00:36:35.54,"that might become a liability?>> Yeah, he puts his name on the"

591,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,"going on the chopping blocktoday."""
592,00:36:41.92,00:36:41.92,"He'll mention it every day.When he's tired, he'll announce"
593,00:36:44.29,00:36:44.29,that he's tired.He doesn't have to do that.
594,00:36:46.21,00:36:46.21,"See, when you're tired, just golay down."
595,00:36:47.83,00:36:47.83,We understand.You're a card player.
596,00:36:49.21,00:36:49.21,You haven't been in the sun.You're used to people bringing

598,00:36:53.50,00:36:53.50,"helping you chew.You know, we don't expect that"
599,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,much from you.So you don't have to go on and
600,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,"on about it, which I guess ispart of his tactic."
601,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,"But I'm like, ""Dude, you don'thave to talk that much."""
602,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when youguys all merged together, did"
603,00:37:05.21,00:37:05.21,you try to find cracks in theFei Long group?
604,00:37:08.62,00:37:08.62,>> You kind of know about someof the cracks already.
605,00:37:11.12,00:37:11.12,We've had spies back and forth.I know Jean-Robert's name has
606,00:37:14.92,00:37:14.92,come up quite a bit.He's politicking his ass off.
607,00:37:18.88,00:37:18.88,He's doing everything he can toensure that he's got as many
608,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,"votes on the jury as possible.>> PROBST: Jaime, what do you"
609,00:37:25.54,00:37:25.54,think the key is to getting theattention off you?
610,00:37:28.08,00:37:28.08,"If you hear that your name is onthe block, what should you do?"
611,00:37:31.92,00:37:31.92,">> You know, I just kind ofwanted to come in here and talk"
612,00:37:34.04,00:37:34.04,"to the Fei Long members, just incase there was a crack, just in"
613,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,case there was someone on thatteam that they just can't stand
614,00:37:38.46,00:37:38.46,enough that they would be happyto get rid of.
615,00:37:40.71,00:37:40.71,"You know, it just would take oneother person to be like, ""I"
616,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,"really can't stand this personanymore; I want them to go home,"
617,00:37:44.96,00:37:44.96,"and Jaime is more pleasant to bearound, so..."""

627,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,>> PROBST: Yes.>> I found this at camp lying on
628,00:39:22.04,00:39:22.04,"the floor, so I thought it mightbe immunity."
629,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,>> PROBST: Thanks.The rules of Survivor state that
