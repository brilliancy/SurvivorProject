378,00:25:49.10,00:25:49.10,"She can't wait to vote her off.>> Okay, well..."
379,00:25:51.33,00:25:51.33,>> I say we put theboxing gloves on.
380,00:25:54.27,00:25:54.27,There's no difference betweenJerri and Shii Ann to me.
381,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,I don't care for either one ofthem.
382,00:25:59.47,00:25:59.47,"Shii Ann annoys me as much ifnot more than Jerri does, so if"
383,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,"it came down to tolerance orpersonal irritation, I'd have a"
384,00:26:07.43,00:26:07.43,"tough time deciding.>> What a beautiful,"
385,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,beautiful day.>> ...anything to drink?
386,00:26:18.20,00:26:18.20,>> Yes.Are you serving alcohol?
387,00:26:20.07,00:26:20.07,"(laughing): Oh, my God!>> I'm having a margarita,"
388,00:26:22.63,00:26:22.63,please.>> I'll have a beer.
389,00:26:24.57,00:26:24.57,>> Beer.>> Beer.
390,00:26:26.17,00:26:26.17,>> Wow.>> Here we go.
391,00:26:28.47,00:26:28.47,All right.>> Environmentally friendly golf
392,00:26:30.37,00:26:30.37,"balls, so you're free to pick aclub."
393,00:26:32.83,00:26:32.83,>> I'll take that one.>> I was on the state
394,00:26:34.53,00:26:34.53,championship golf team at myhigh school.
395,00:26:55.30,00:26:55.30,">> Hey, you damn ball.I'm going to beat you."
396,00:27:02.40,00:27:02.40,>> Wow!>> There goes the driver.
397,00:27:06.00,00:27:06.00,">> Oh!>> Oh, no."
398,00:27:07.70,00:27:07.70,"(laughing)Oh, my God."
399,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,>> Fore!>> That was the funniest thing
400,00:27:13.03,00:27:13.03,"yet.>> You are just trouble,"
401,00:27:14.70,00:27:14.70,you know that?>> Just every time.
402,00:27:16.40,00:27:16.40,>> Just trouble.>> Every time.
403,00:27:33.03,00:27:33.03,">> If I catch a fish today,I beat Rupert."
404,00:27:36.60,00:27:36.60,Just a little bit of luck.That's all I want to do.
405,00:27:39.80,00:27:39.80,"He's beaten me every day, buttoday, I'm hoping Big Tom"
406,00:27:42.30,00:27:42.30,scores.>> Kathy...
407,00:27:46.37,00:27:46.37,>> Yeah?>> Your tribe is probably
408,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,leaving right now for TribalCouncil.
409,00:27:49.30,00:27:49.30,>> I know they are.They are running around trying
410,00:27:52.03,00:27:52.03,"to figure out what to do, too.>> Kathy is a tough"
411,00:27:54.83,00:27:54.83,"woman, and wants to get as faras she can in this game, and she"
412,00:27:57.60,00:27:57.60,may be the perfect person to tryto pull over into our group.
413,00:28:02.00,00:28:02.00,>> Probably seems like you mightrub Lex anything... normal.
414,00:28:05.53,00:28:05.53,>> Too many chiefs.>> He's just playing real hard.
415,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,>> She offered up a lotof information.
416,00:28:11.07,00:28:11.07,>> So you and Lex votealong the same lines.
417,00:28:14.17,00:28:14.17,"And what about Shii Ann, wheredoes she fit in?"
418,00:28:16.13,00:28:16.13,>> She's with us.>> She's with you.
419,00:28:17.77,00:28:17.77,>> We've pretty muchfigured that out.
420,00:28:20.10,00:28:20.10,I am not sure that she's tellingus 100% the truth.
421,00:28:22.90,00:28:22.90,"I wouldn't expect her to betelling us the truth, unless she"
422,00:28:27.37,00:28:27.37,"is foreseeing that her tribe isone member down, and she's going"
423,00:28:31.30,00:28:31.30,to have to save her ass.>> I had four poles and
424,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,never caught a fish.So Rupert caught more fish in
425,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,a day with a stick than I did ona $3 million yacht.
426,00:28:45.50,00:28:45.50,But I'm going to tell yousomething.
427,00:28:47.33,00:28:47.33,Kathy fell in our trap.We got the girls up there
428,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,"numbing her up.I didn't think she'd fall, but"
429,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,"she is, she's up there...They're getting her numb now."
430,00:28:55.67,00:28:55.67,>> I'm so sorry.>> I'm so sorry.
431,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,(conversation fading)>> I'm not feeling good
432,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,and I'm not feeling secure aboutmy position here at all.
433,00:29:17.97,00:29:17.97,"You know, I'm at a loss rightnow."
434,00:29:19.47,00:29:19.47,I'm all over the place.I'm a jumbled puzzle.
435,00:29:22.50,00:29:22.50,But I feel there is a way out.(chuckles)
436,00:29:39.27,00:29:39.27,>> I've been pushing forJerri since day one.
437,00:29:41.60,00:29:41.60,She's getting on our nerves.It was pretty simple to go to
438,00:29:44.13,00:29:44.13,"Colby and say ""Jerri.""So it was an easy choice."
439,00:29:59.67,00:29:59.67,>> I think our decision was madewhen Jerri Manthey came on
440,00:30:01.67,00:30:01.67,"board.I mean, that's the one we want"
441,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,to get rid of.And that's just the effect she
442,00:30:05.50,00:30:05.50,has on people.I don't know that this game is a
443,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,game that's meant for JerriManthey to play.
444,00:30:15.57,00:30:15.57,>> You don't get far inthis game by playing safe.
445,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,I had already made a consciousdecision to change my strategy
446,00:30:21.97,00:30:21.97,"from how I played in Africa, inthat I was going to come in here"
447,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67,"and if I had to make harddecisions, and if I had to do a"
448,00:30:26.73,00:30:26.73,"little lying, I was going to doit."
449,00:30:30.57,00:30:30.57,Want to go for a little walk?>> Hmm?
450,00:30:35.70,00:30:35.70,>> I find myself now at thedoorway of an opportunity to do
451,00:30:38.63,00:30:38.63,"just that, for the first time inthe game-- to really do"
452,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,something that probably no oneis going to expect me to do.
453,00:30:45.53,00:30:45.53,Their plan is to get rid of youtonight.
454,00:30:47.47,00:30:47.47,>> I knew that was coming.>> And they think I'm agreeing
455,00:30:50.43,00:30:50.43,"with them and that Shii Ann is,as well, okay?"
456,00:30:54.47,00:30:54.47,But that's not going to happen.We're going to do Colby tonight.
457,00:31:00.10,00:31:00.10,>> I'm very content withthat decision.
458,00:31:02.67,00:31:02.67,">> I've thought about thisa lot, and I think that we're"
459,00:31:07.37,00:31:07.37,"just... we're on the eve of amerge, and Colby is so"
460,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,"dangerous, post-merge, when he'sdoing individual challenges--"
461,00:31:15.90,00:31:15.90,"he's dangerous.>> I mean, that's something you"
462,00:31:18.27,00:31:18.27,don't even have to tell meabout.
463,00:31:20.40,00:31:20.40,I already dealt with him...>> So you're on board.
464,00:31:22.37,00:31:22.37,">> Totally.>> You, me and Shii Ann"
465,00:31:24.07,00:31:24.07,are voting for Colby.He's not gonna see this coming a
466,00:31:26.33,00:31:26.33,"mile away, I don't think.This is my one and only"
467,00:31:28.80,00:31:28.80,opportunity to take him outbefore it goes...
468,00:31:31.30,00:31:31.30,slips right through my fingers.So I'm jumping on it.
469,00:31:35.03,00:31:35.03,">> Well, I am solid on thatvote."
470,00:31:37.03,00:31:37.03,"'Cause there's... there's a tad bit of revenge there, so..."
471,00:31:39.23,00:31:39.23,I'm a little nervous.I'm just hoping that the info
472,00:31:44.77,00:31:44.77,"that I'm getting is, in fact,what's going to happen tonight."
473,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,"But there's always a chance Lexcould be playing me, just as"
474,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,much as he's playing Colby.>> I think he's going to
475,00:31:55.03,00:31:55.03,"take it hard, 'cause I don'tthink he's going to expect it."
476,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,"But as far as he knows now, I'mtaking you aside to tell you"
477,00:31:59.80,00:31:59.80,that it's Ethan.>> Colby doesn't see this
478,00:32:02.27,00:32:02.27,coming at all.He doesn't see a single vote
479,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,"coming in his direction.For me, that was a goal, that I"
480,00:32:07.63,00:32:07.63,"set for myself, was to lastlonger than Colby."
481,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,"And if it took losing today toget him out of here, I'm totally"
482,00:32:14.13,00:32:14.13,fine with it.>> But I know you're solid.
483,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,"I'm not worried about it.Shii Ann, this is the difference"
484,00:32:20.50,00:32:20.50,between her lasting a long timein this game or her going in a
485,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90,"few days.>> Yeah, okay."
486,00:32:26.30,00:32:26.30,>> I think there's going tobe big surprises tonight.
487,00:32:28.57,00:32:28.57,I think there's a lot of peoplethat probably won't see it
488,00:32:30.33,00:32:30.33,"coming.I think that for you especially,"
489,00:32:32.80,00:32:32.80,"right now, this is like a realcusp moment."
490,00:32:35.43,00:32:35.43,>> I know.>> And if we...
491,00:32:37.23,00:32:37.23,>> I'm so...>> ...if we can pull this
492,00:32:40.13,00:32:40.13,"off, you are so in there, I amso in there."
493,00:32:43.13,00:32:43.13,>> I feel troublebrewing in this camp.
494,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,Lex came up to me and asked meto vote out Colby today.
495,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"But Jerri is so lazy, she annoysme, she doesn't work that much"
496,00:32:53.23,00:32:53.23,at camp.I want to think about nothing
497,00:32:55.80,00:32:55.80,"but how to vote you off.Kathy, my biggest ally, is on a"
498,00:32:59.70,00:32:59.70,boat somewhere.I'm stuck here with a bunch of
499,00:33:02.17,00:33:02.17,"power players, and I've got tomake my move."
500,00:33:21.03,00:33:21.03,>> Whee!(Tom singing gibberish)
501,00:33:27.47,00:33:27.47,">> Big Tom just said,""I really miss my goats."""
502,00:33:31.03,00:33:31.03,(Alicia laughing)Cut him off.
503,00:33:32.43,00:33:32.43,No more booze for this man.>> That's it.
504,00:33:34.80,00:33:34.80,">> Oh, we got champagne!(cheering and whooping)"
505,00:33:40.23,00:33:40.23,>> We had come to the endof a perfect day.
506,00:33:42.27,00:33:42.27,"So we went out onto the bow, andthey brought us out champagne."
507,00:33:46.37,00:33:46.37,(cheering)And the sun was going down.
508,00:33:49.87,00:33:49.87,"It was just a perfect, perfectmoment."
509,00:33:52.07,00:33:52.07,">> All right, let's toast.>> Here's to one of the"
510,00:33:54.40,00:33:54.40,most memorable days we'll everhave probably in our lives.
511,00:33:56.77,00:33:56.77,>> And you know what?Here's to having a blast at this
512,00:33:59.10,00:33:59.10,game.(Tom belches)
513,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,">> I ain't drunk much champagne,but I didn't think much of it."
514,00:34:03.63,00:34:03.63,It had too many bubbles in it.But I ain't gonna be bitching
515,00:34:06.13,00:34:06.13,"with my mouth full, don't get mewrong."
516,00:34:08.53,00:34:08.53,>> I just might have to stayover here.
517,00:34:19.13,00:34:19.13,">> I'd be lying if I said,you know, I won't go to Tribal"
518,00:34:21.47,00:34:21.47,"Council with a certain amount offear, but I feel as confident as"
519,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,I could...that everything at
520,00:34:27.77,00:34:27.77,this point is going to goaccording to plan.
521,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,>> Everybody ready?>> If tonight is played
522,00:34:32.20,00:34:32.20,"straightforward, it should befour votes to one, Jerri Manthey"
523,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,"going home, but as we've allknown from the get-go, it's a"
524,00:34:37.23,00:34:37.23,game of curveballs.If Jerri feels as though her
525,00:34:40.30,00:34:40.30,"back's against the wall, whoknows what she could pull out?"
526,00:34:43.10,00:34:43.10,That is another reason why sheneeds to go tonight.
527,00:35:07.87,00:35:07.87,>> PROBST: Welcome to TribalCouncil.
528,00:35:10.70,00:35:10.70,Let's talk about today'schallenge.
529,00:35:13.03,00:35:13.03,"Reward and immunity and accessto one of your tribe members,"
530,00:35:17.13,00:35:17.13,"which could potentially bedevastating, if they give up"

532,00:35:22.63,00:35:22.63,You guys had a huge lead goinginto the jungle.
533,00:35:24.60,00:35:24.60,">> Huge is, you know, amatter of opinion, Jeff."
534,00:35:27.07,00:35:27.07,">> PROBST: Pretty big.>> Nah, okay."
535,00:35:28.60,00:35:28.60,"No, you're right.Um, I take full responsibility"
536,00:35:30.83,00:35:30.83,for what happened with thechallenge today.
537,00:35:32.97,00:35:32.97,"I feel horrible about it.I feel bad I let my team down,"
538,00:35:35.80,00:35:35.80,"let myself down, uh, and it'sembarrassing."
539,00:35:38.17,00:35:38.17,I don't want to lose to Rob.I don't want to lose to Chapera.
540,00:35:41.10,00:35:41.10,">> PROBST: Colby, it seems likethere's a little bit of"
541,00:35:43.97,00:35:43.97,animosity between these twotribes.
542,00:35:45.87,00:35:45.87,>> Yeah.I agree with Ethan.
543,00:35:48.40,00:35:48.40,I hated losing to Rob.I don't think any of us are
544,00:35:51.90,00:35:51.90,looking forward to a merge.Coexisting and cohabitating with
545,00:35:55.90,00:35:55.90,those guys is not something I'mlooking forward to.
546,00:35:58.33,00:35:58.33,">> PROBST: Lex, are you guysreally already thinking about a"
547,00:36:00.97,00:36:00.97,merge?>> All of us are definitely
548,00:36:03.47,00:36:03.47,"thinking about a merge.I mean, every time we go to a"
549,00:36:05.47,00:36:05.47,"challenge and see these otherplayers, we're sizing them up."
550,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,">> PROBST: So, it stands toreason, if you're looking at"
551,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,"Chapera and thinking who'sgoing to be a threat, you must"
552,00:36:12.57,00:36:12.57,be looking at your own tribealready and thinking who's
553,00:36:14.90,00:36:14.90,going to be a threat.>> You better believe it.
554,00:36:16.73,00:36:16.73,"Absolutely.Who's going to be a threat, and"
555,00:36:18.97,00:36:18.97,who's going to be somebody thatcan help you...
556,00:36:21.23,00:36:21.23,"in a post-merge situation.>> PROBST: Jerri, so how do you"
557,00:36:25.10,00:36:25.10,navigate this one?Because it's still a tribal
558,00:36:27.53,00:36:27.53,"game.>> When I vote, I vote..."
559,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,"for the person I find to be mybiggest threat, because that"

561,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,That is something that you haveto consider throughout the
562,00:36:39.37,00:36:39.37,entire course of the game.>> And I disagree with that.
563,00:36:42.30,00:36:42.30,"I'm sorry, if you're notthrough, I'll let you finish."
564,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,">> No, go ahead.>> We're here because we lost."
565,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,We can't afford to lose again.It doesn't make sense to start
566,00:36:50.27,00:36:50.27,"eliminating people that youknow, in some capacity, will"
567,00:36:53.73,00:36:53.73,"help you compete.To me, it just doesn't make"
568,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,sense to start cutting your legsoff.
569,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,">> PROBST: Shii Ann, who couldthis tribe most afford to lose,"
570,00:37:01.90,00:37:01.90,"from a physical point of view?>> Well, from a physical point"
571,00:37:05.23,00:37:05.23,"of view, it would probably be meor Jerri."
572,00:37:07.30,00:37:07.30,We're physically possibly theweakest tribe members here.
573,00:37:10.60,00:37:10.60,"I'm sorry, Jerri, to speak foryou..."
574,00:37:12.20,00:37:12.20,">> Yeah, please don't.>> ...but physically I think"
575,00:37:13.60,00:37:13.60,we...But I would hate for this vote
576,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,"to be purely based on physicalstrength, because obviously,"
577,00:37:21.23,00:37:21.23,then...I might be the next to
578,00:37:23.63,00:37:23.63,"go, and I would not like to goat this time."
579,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23,">> PROBST: Jerri, do you agreewith Shii Ann?"
580,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,Are you possibly one of theweakest links on this tribe?
581,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,">> Um... well, I'm really goodat putting puzzles together."
582,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,"(laughs) Um, I'm good atstrategizing."
583,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,And I feel like I am anuplifting member who is
584,00:37:43.03,00:37:43.03,"generally in a good mood andkeeping spirits high, and I feel"
585,00:37:47.97,00:37:47.97,"I have a lot to offer.>> PROBST: Shii Ann, who could"
586,00:37:51.20,00:37:51.20,the tribe least afford to losefrom a physical point of view?
587,00:37:54.27,00:37:54.27,">> Sorry, Ethan, I have to saythat Colby is physically the"
588,00:37:57.40,00:37:57.40,strongest member of this tribe.He's a very valuable member.
589,00:38:01.13,00:38:01.13,"Strongest physically, definitelyColby."
590,00:38:03.43,00:38:03.43,">> PROBST: So, Colby, does thatmake you feel secure hearing"
591,00:38:05.70,00:38:05.70,"that, that you are leading thetribe?"
592,00:38:09.00,00:38:09.00,">> My first thought was,wow, that really puts me out"
593,00:38:12.30,00:38:12.30,there for...when we do get to
594,00:38:14.77,00:38:14.77,that point where it isindividual.
595,00:38:16.27,00:38:16.27,"No offense to you, Shii Ann,but..."
596,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,"but, yeah, that's weird.My first thought was, wow, I"
597,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,"don't feel secure now, I feelvulnerable, because I've just"
598,00:38:24.47,00:38:24.47,been pointed out as thestrongest guy in this tribe.
599,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,Do they see me as the guythey've got to get rid of?
600,00:38:29.83,00:38:29.83,">> PROBST: Lex, you think theperson voted out tonight's gonna"
601,00:38:32.20,00:38:32.20,"be shocked?>> Tonight, on our tribe,"
602,00:38:34.03,00:38:34.03,the only person that doesn'thave to worry about loyalty and
603,00:38:36.33,00:38:36.33,"worry about the shock of beingvoted out is Kathy, who's"
604,00:38:39.27,00:38:39.27,whooping it up with Chapera.There's gonna be nothing fun
605,00:38:42.30,00:38:42.30,"about it.>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
606,00:38:44.80,00:38:44.80,"vote.Ethan, you're up."
607,00:38:58.63,00:38:58.63,">> Jerri...you're two-faced, so... bye."
608,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,>> You and I both know thatthis game has absolutely nothing
609,00:39:13.80,00:39:13.80,to do with friendship.I had to make a hard call and
610,00:39:16.57,00:39:16.57,it meant taking you out.>> Is this a revenge vote?
611,00:39:39.57,00:39:39.57,"Hell, yeah.>> You have underestimated my"
612,00:39:51.63,00:39:51.63,powers.Perhaps you should spend some
613,00:39:54.33,00:39:54.33,time analyzing your own.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
614,00:40:05.30,00:40:05.30,votes.>> PROBST: Once the votes are
615,00:40:24.47,00:40:24.47,"read, the decision is final.The person voted out will be"
616,00:40:26.70,00:40:26.70,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
617,00:40:28.67,00:40:28.67,I'll read the votes.First vote...
618,00:40:34.03,00:40:34.03,Colby.Colby.
619,00:40:39.47,00:40:39.47,That's two votes Colby.Jerri.
620,00:40:45.70,00:40:45.70,"Two votes Colby, one vote Jerri.Jerri."
621,00:40:51.83,00:40:51.83,"Two votes Jerri, two votesColby."
622,00:40:53.80,00:40:53.80,I'll read the last vote.The seventh person voted out of
623,00:40:58.70,00:40:58.70,the tribe...Colby.
624,00:41:02.37,00:41:02.37,"Need to bring me your torch.Colby, the tribe has spoken."
625,00:41:20.80,00:41:20.80,"There you go.Well, based on tonight's vote,"
626,00:41:33.23,00:41:33.23,"it seems that the prevailingwisdom, Mogo Mogo, is to vote"
627,00:41:36.63,00:41:36.63,out the person you think will bemost threatening if and when it
628,00:41:39.70,00:41:39.70,becomes an individual game.Interesting strategy.
629,00:41:42.97,00:41:42.97,We'll see if it pays off or not.You guys can head back to camp.
630,00:41:45.90,00:41:45.90,Kathy'll be waiting for you whenyou get there.
