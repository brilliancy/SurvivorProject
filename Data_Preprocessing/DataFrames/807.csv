267,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,It's a house. It's a house on a lake.

275,00:18:58.00,00:18:58.00,We needed that. >> There's burgers this

277,00:19:06.57,00:19:06.57,"and asparagus and corn on the cob and salty, greasy, beautiful"
278,00:19:10.97,00:19:10.97,"food. >> Jenna, there's no way you can"
279,00:19:13.63,00:19:13.63,eat all that. >> I'm so puking this up and
280,00:19:17.67,00:19:17.67,"eating dessert. >> Hell, yeah."
281,00:19:20.83,00:19:20.83,>> I totally forgot about dessert.
282,00:19:22.23,00:19:22.23,">> Yesterday, you're like, you might have a piece of rice."
283,00:19:23.73,00:19:23.73,>> Do I have something right here?

285,00:19:27.20,00:19:27.20,>> I felt totally welcomed by Chapera.
286,00:19:29.97,00:19:29.97,"I mean, they brought me in like I was one of their tribe"
287,00:19:32.97,00:19:32.97,"members. >> It's funny, because every"
288,00:19:34.77,00:19:34.77,time you think it can't get better...
289,00:19:36.27,00:19:36.27,>> It does. >> It does.
290,00:19:38.27,00:19:38.27,>> ...it does. >> I feel that there's going to
291,00:19:41.03,00:19:41.03,"be a lot of tension for me, if we do merge, in swinging, you"
292,00:19:44.10,00:19:44.10,"know, from this loy... this loyalty to that loyalty, and if"
293,00:19:47.07,00:19:47.07,"I do, where and when I swing, I've got to really be careful."

300,00:20:07.37,00:20:07.37,"Doo-dah, Doo-dah day... \xe2\x99\xaa >> Yeah!"
301,00:20:34.63,00:20:34.63,">> Huge, huge challenge today. Huge reward for the winning"
302,00:20:38.73,00:20:38.73,"tribe, and unfortunately, for us, we basically got beat out by"
303,00:20:45.70,00:20:45.70,"just a hair, and the lead was ours to lose the whole time."
304,00:20:50.63,00:20:50.63,"I mean, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an enormous"
305,00:20:52.77,00:20:52.77,disappointment-- it was a huge disappointment.
306,00:21:02.53,00:21:02.53,>> I just want to apologize formally.
307,00:21:05.27,00:21:05.27,"I screwed up, and, uh... >> I don't think its any one"
308,00:21:11.03,00:21:11.03,"person's fault, Ethan. >> Yeah, I think we all tried."
309,00:21:13.47,00:21:13.47,">> I know we all tried, but I feel responsible and I'm"
310,00:21:16.30,00:21:16.30,taking responsibility for it and I'm sorry.
311,00:21:18.43,00:21:18.43,>> Right on. >> I feel largely
312,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,responsible for our loss today. I just could not get those ropes
313,00:21:25.50,00:21:25.50,"untied, and I lost the lead. >> You want to talk about it?"
314,00:21:31.53,00:21:31.53,>> I couldn't get the knot out. The knot was tight.
315,00:21:34.67,00:21:34.67,I just couldn't get the knot out.
316,00:21:36.70,00:21:36.70,"You know, my tribe sees me as a powerhouse, as, you know,"
317,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,"someone who can help them in challenges, and I failed, and"
318,00:21:42.63,00:21:42.63,"it feels horrible to fail, you know."
319,00:21:44.50,00:21:44.50,"You're either the hero or you're the goat, and today I was the"
320,00:21:48.40,00:21:48.40,"goat. Do they see a need for me here,"
321,00:21:55.20,00:21:55.20,"or can they just let me go? I don't know, and obviously"
322,00:21:59.23,00:21:59.23,we've got to vote someone off tonight.
323,00:22:14.63,00:22:14.63,">> First, we get off the boat and they take us to this oasis."
324,00:22:18.10,00:22:18.10,"It was so inviting, and you know something's great coming, so"
325,00:22:21.00,00:22:21.00,"you keep getting more excited. You just ate a huge meal, you"
326,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"should be happy, but you know something more's coming."
327,00:22:25.67,00:22:25.67,">> We're walking up to something good, guys."
328,00:22:28.30,00:22:28.30,We are definitely... >> We are in something
329,00:22:30.97,00:22:30.97,good and it just keeps getting better with every step.
330,00:22:33.80,00:22:33.80,">> Oh... >> Oh, my God, chocolate."
331,00:22:38.37,00:22:38.37,">> Oh, my God. >> And there stands a"
332,00:22:41.13,00:22:41.13,large cart with every kind of dessert you can imagine.
333,00:22:47.97,00:22:47.97,Mmm! (all groaning with pleasure)
334,00:22:54.73,00:22:54.73,I've never packed so much food in my mouth in a short time.
335,00:22:57.43,00:22:57.43,"It was disgusting, but so good. >> Yeah, that's peanut buttery."
336,00:23:01.70,00:23:01.70,>> Is that cheesecake over there?
337,00:23:03.33,00:23:03.33,"What is that? >> Oh, my God."
338,00:23:07.13,00:23:07.13,">> Oh, my God. >> I'm going in there."
339,00:23:09.53,00:23:09.53,"I mean, it's just too beautiful to pass up."
340,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,>> The water is crystal clear. >> Crystal clear.
341,00:23:15.03,00:23:15.03,>> You guys should come see this.
342,00:23:16.67,00:23:16.67,>> The gorgeous waterfall right below us.
343,00:23:18.80,00:23:18.80,It's just so crazy to think places that beautiful exist in
344,00:23:21.60,00:23:21.60,the world and... that the fact
345,00:23:22.93,00:23:22.93,that we're getting a chance to see them.
346,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"(laughs) >> You guys, this is"
347,00:23:28.03,00:23:28.03,unbelievable. The Chapera tribe-- you know
348,00:23:41.33,00:23:41.33,"what they've got that we don't have, is they're having fun."
349,00:23:44.17,00:23:44.17,They're enjoying the game. And I knew it was lacking with
350,00:23:47.90,00:23:47.90,"my Mogo Mogo tribe. I wasn't having fun, it's just"
351,00:23:51.10,00:23:51.10,"been work, work, work. And yet, Chapera's having a"
352,00:23:53.73,00:23:53.73,"great time. I mean, they're dancing, they've"
353,00:23:55.57,00:23:55.57,got silly little songs. When you do go away and you
354,00:23:58.30,00:23:58.30,"experience civilization again, all of a sudden, it opens your"
355,00:24:01.30,00:24:01.30,head as to other options. If I choose to swing over to
356,00:24:05.03,00:24:05.03,"them, it's just gonna have to be the right time and tons of"
357,00:24:08.13,00:24:08.13,"communication. It'll be tricky, but there's"
358,00:24:10.50,00:24:10.50,no way I'm going to tell my tribe that I fit in like a
359,00:24:13.27,00:24:13.27,"glove. Mm-mm, no."
360,00:24:38.27,00:24:38.27,>> You'd eat that? I think it's rotten.
361,00:24:42.20,00:24:42.20,You would? >> I'd eat that.
362,00:24:43.93,00:24:43.93,">> You would, okay. >> If you cook it."
363,00:24:46.13,00:24:46.13,>> Okay. I'll cook it. >> Everyone is on edge.
364,00:24:49.53,00:24:49.53,Regardless of whether people want to pretend like they're
365,00:24:51.53,00:24:51.53,"happy to see each other or if they're having fun or not, it's"
366,00:24:54.43,00:24:54.43,a very stressful situation. God bless America.
367,00:25:01.30,00:25:01.30,>> That's something that I'm going to saut\xc3\xa9.
368,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,Jerri is just rubbing me the wrong way.
369,00:25:10.13,00:25:10.13,She's only willing to do the chores that you're already
370,00:25:12.73,00:25:12.73,"doing. >> Shii Ann, if you want,"
371,00:25:18.10,00:25:18.10,I'll take that out and you can chop that up or whatever.
372,00:25:20.67,00:25:20.67,">> No, it's okay. You can chop it."
373,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,I'm just going to chip these off.
374,00:25:24.57,00:25:24.57,"She didn't want to eat the rotting coconut, and I was going"
375,00:25:26.53,00:25:26.53,to put some of the rotting coconut into the pot to cook and
376,00:25:30.00,00:25:30.00,she snapped at me. >> Shii Ann...
377,00:25:43.37,00:25:43.37,>> I saw Shii Ann roll her eyes at Jerri again today.
378,00:25:46.53,00:25:46.53,She's fed up with all of Jerri's stuff.
379,00:25:49.10,00:25:49.10,"She can't wait to vote her off. >> Okay, well..."
380,00:25:51.33,00:25:51.33,>> I say we put the boxing gloves on.
381,00:25:54.27,00:25:54.27,There's no difference between Jerri and Shii Ann to me.
382,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,I don't care for either one of them.
383,00:25:59.47,00:25:59.47,"Shii Ann annoys me as much if not more than Jerri does, so if"
384,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,"it came down to tolerance or personal irritation, I'd have a"
385,00:26:07.43,00:26:07.43,"tough time deciding. >> What a beautiful,"
386,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,beautiful day. >> ...anything to drink?
387,00:26:18.20,00:26:18.20,>> Yes. Are you serving alcohol?
388,00:26:20.07,00:26:20.07,"(laughing): Oh, my God! >> I'm having a margarita,"
389,00:26:22.63,00:26:22.63,please. >> I'll have a beer.
390,00:26:24.57,00:26:24.57,>> Beer. >> Beer.
391,00:26:26.17,00:26:26.17,>> Wow. >> Here we go.
392,00:26:28.47,00:26:28.47,All right. >> Environmentally friendly golf
393,00:26:30.37,00:26:30.37,"balls, so you're free to pick a club."
394,00:26:32.83,00:26:32.83,>> I'll take that one. >> I was on the state
395,00:26:34.53,00:26:34.53,championship golf team at my high school.
396,00:26:55.30,00:26:55.30,">> Hey, you damn ball. I'm going to beat you."
397,00:27:02.40,00:27:02.40,>> Wow! >> There goes the driver.
398,00:27:06.00,00:27:06.00,">> Oh! >> Oh, no."
399,00:27:07.70,00:27:07.70,"(laughing) Oh, my God."
400,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,>> Fore! >> That was the funniest thing
401,00:27:13.03,00:27:13.03,"yet. >> You are just trouble,"
402,00:27:14.70,00:27:14.70,you know that? >> Just every time.
403,00:27:16.40,00:27:16.40,>> Just trouble. >> Every time.
404,00:27:33.03,00:27:33.03,">> If I catch a fish today, I beat Rupert."
405,00:27:36.60,00:27:36.60,Just a little bit of luck. That's all I want to do.
406,00:27:39.80,00:27:39.80,"He's beaten me every day, but today, I'm hoping Big Tom"
407,00:27:42.30,00:27:42.30,scores. >> Kathy...
408,00:27:46.37,00:27:46.37,>> Yeah? >> Your tribe is probably
409,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,leaving right now for Tribal Council.
410,00:27:49.30,00:27:49.30,>> I know they are. They are running around trying
411,00:27:52.03,00:27:52.03,"to figure out what to do, too. >> Kathy is a tough"
412,00:27:54.83,00:27:54.83,"woman, and wants to get as far as she can in this game, and she"
413,00:27:57.60,00:27:57.60,may be the perfect person to try to pull over into our group.
414,00:28:02.00,00:28:02.00,>> Probably seems like you might rub Lex anything... normal.
415,00:28:05.53,00:28:05.53,>> Too many chiefs. >> He's just playing real hard.
416,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,>> She offered up a lot of information.
417,00:28:11.07,00:28:11.07,>> So you and Lex vote along the same lines.
418,00:28:14.17,00:28:14.17,"And what about Shii Ann, where does she fit in?"
419,00:28:16.13,00:28:16.13,>> She's with us. >> She's with you.
420,00:28:17.77,00:28:17.77,>> We've pretty much figured that out.
421,00:28:20.10,00:28:20.10,I am not sure that she's telling us 100% the truth.
422,00:28:22.90,00:28:22.90,"I wouldn't expect her to be telling us the truth, unless she"
423,00:28:27.37,00:28:27.37,"is foreseeing that her tribe is one member down, and she's going"
424,00:28:31.30,00:28:31.30,to have to save her ass. >> I had four poles and
425,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,never caught a fish. So Rupert caught more fish in
426,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,a day with a stick than I did on a $3 million yacht.
427,00:28:45.50,00:28:45.50,But I'm going to tell you something.
428,00:28:47.33,00:28:47.33,Kathy fell in our trap. We got the girls up there
429,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,"numbing her up. I didn't think she'd fall, but"
430,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,"she is, she's up there... They're getting her numb now."
431,00:28:55.67,00:28:55.67,>> I'm so sorry. >> I'm so sorry.
432,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,(conversation fading) >> I'm not feeling good
433,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,and I'm not feeling secure about my position here at all.
434,00:29:17.97,00:29:17.97,"You know, I'm at a loss right now."
435,00:29:19.47,00:29:19.47,I'm all over the place. I'm a jumbled puzzle.
436,00:29:22.50,00:29:22.50,But I feel there is a way out. (chuckles)
437,00:29:39.27,00:29:39.27,>> I've been pushing for Jerri since day one.
438,00:29:41.60,00:29:41.60,She's getting on our nerves. It was pretty simple to go to
439,00:29:44.13,00:29:44.13,"Colby and say ""Jerri."" So it was an easy choice."
440,00:29:59.67,00:29:59.67,>> I think our decision was made when Jerri Manthey came on
441,00:30:01.67,00:30:01.67,"board. I mean, that's the one we want"
442,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,to get rid of. And that's just the effect she
443,00:30:05.50,00:30:05.50,has on people. I don't know that this game is a
444,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,game that's meant for Jerri Manthey to play.
445,00:30:15.57,00:30:15.57,>> You don't get far in this game by playing safe.
446,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,I had already made a conscious decision to change my strategy
447,00:30:21.97,00:30:21.97,"from how I played in Africa, in that I was going to come in here"
448,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67,"and if I had to make hard decisions, and if I had to do a"
449,00:30:26.73,00:30:26.73,"little lying, I was going to do it."
450,00:30:30.57,00:30:30.57,Want to go for a little walk? >> Hmm?
451,00:30:35.70,00:30:35.70,>> I find myself now at the doorway of an opportunity to do
452,00:30:38.63,00:30:38.63,"just that, for the first time in the game-- to really do"
453,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,something that probably no one is going to expect me to do.
454,00:30:45.53,00:30:45.53,Their plan is to get rid of you tonight.
455,00:30:47.47,00:30:47.47,>> I knew that was coming. >> And they think I'm agreeing
456,00:30:50.43,00:30:50.43,"with them and that Shii Ann is, as well, okay?"
457,00:30:54.47,00:30:54.47,But that's not going to happen. We're going to do Colby tonight.
458,00:31:00.10,00:31:00.10,>> I'm very content with that decision.
459,00:31:02.67,00:31:02.67,">> I've thought about this a lot, and I think that we're"
460,00:31:07.37,00:31:07.37,"just... we're on the eve of a merge, and Colby is so"
461,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,"dangerous, post-merge, when he's doing individual challenges--"
462,00:31:15.90,00:31:15.90,"he's dangerous. >> I mean, that's something you"
463,00:31:18.27,00:31:18.27,don't even have to tell me about.
464,00:31:20.40,00:31:20.40,I already dealt with him... >> So you're on board.
465,00:31:22.37,00:31:22.37,">> Totally. >> You, me and Shii Ann"
466,00:31:24.07,00:31:24.07,are voting for Colby. He's not gonna see this coming a
467,00:31:26.33,00:31:26.33,"mile away, I don't think. This is my one and only"
468,00:31:28.80,00:31:28.80,opportunity to take him out before it goes...
469,00:31:31.30,00:31:31.30,slips right through my fingers. So I'm jumping on it.
470,00:31:35.03,00:31:35.03,">> Well, I am solid on that vote."
471,00:31:37.03,00:31:37.03,"'Cause there's... there's a  tad bit of revenge there, so..."
472,00:31:39.23,00:31:39.23,I'm a little nervous. I'm just hoping that the info
473,00:31:44.77,00:31:44.77,"that I'm getting is, in fact, what's going to happen tonight."
474,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,"But there's always a chance Lex could be playing me, just as"
475,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,much as he's playing Colby. >> I think he's going to
476,00:31:55.03,00:31:55.03,"take it hard, 'cause I don't think he's going to expect it."
477,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,"But as far as he knows now, I'm taking you aside to tell you"
478,00:31:59.80,00:31:59.80,that it's Ethan. >> Colby doesn't see this
479,00:32:02.27,00:32:02.27,coming at all. He doesn't see a single vote
480,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,"coming in his direction. For me, that was a goal, that I"
481,00:32:07.63,00:32:07.63,"set for myself, was to last longer than Colby."
482,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,"And if it took losing today to get him out of here, I'm totally"
483,00:32:14.13,00:32:14.13,fine with it. >> But I know you're solid.
484,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,"I'm not worried about it. Shii Ann, this is the difference"
485,00:32:20.50,00:32:20.50,between her lasting a long time in this game or her going in a
486,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90,"few days. >> Yeah, okay."
487,00:32:26.30,00:32:26.30,>> I think there's going to be big surprises tonight.
488,00:32:28.57,00:32:28.57,I think there's a lot of people that probably won't see it
489,00:32:30.33,00:32:30.33,"coming. I think that for you especially,"
490,00:32:32.80,00:32:32.80,"right now, this is like a real cusp moment."
491,00:32:35.43,00:32:35.43,>> I know. >> And if we...
492,00:32:37.23,00:32:37.23,>> I'm so... >> ...if we can pull this
493,00:32:40.13,00:32:40.13,"off, you are so in there, I am so in there."
494,00:32:43.13,00:32:43.13,>> I feel trouble brewing in this camp.
495,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,Lex came up to me and asked me to vote out Colby today.
496,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"But Jerri is so lazy, she annoys me, she doesn't work that much"
497,00:32:53.23,00:32:53.23,at camp. I want to think about nothing
498,00:32:55.80,00:32:55.80,"but how to vote you off. Kathy, my biggest ally, is on a"
499,00:32:59.70,00:32:59.70,boat somewhere. I'm stuck here with a bunch of
500,00:33:02.17,00:33:02.17,"power players, and I've got to make my move."
501,00:33:21.03,00:33:21.03,>> Whee! (Tom singing gibberish)
502,00:33:27.47,00:33:27.47,">> Big Tom just said, ""I really miss my goats."""
503,00:33:31.03,00:33:31.03,(Alicia laughing) Cut him off.
504,00:33:32.43,00:33:32.43,No more booze for this man. >> That's it.
505,00:33:34.80,00:33:34.80,">> Oh, we got champagne! (cheering and whooping)"
506,00:33:40.23,00:33:40.23,>> We had come to the end of a perfect day.
507,00:33:42.27,00:33:42.27,"So we went out onto the bow, and they brought us out champagne."
508,00:33:46.37,00:33:46.37,(cheering) And the sun was going down.
509,00:33:49.87,00:33:49.87,"It was just a perfect, perfect moment."
510,00:33:52.07,00:33:52.07,">> All right, let's toast. >> Here's to one of the"
511,00:33:54.40,00:33:54.40,most memorable days we'll ever have probably in our lives.
512,00:33:56.77,00:33:56.77,>> And you know what? Here's to having a blast at this
513,00:33:59.10,00:33:59.10,game. (Tom belches)
514,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,">> I ain't drunk much champagne, but I didn't think much of it."
515,00:34:03.63,00:34:03.63,It had too many bubbles in it. But I ain't gonna be bitching
516,00:34:06.13,00:34:06.13,"with my mouth full, don't get me wrong."
517,00:34:08.53,00:34:08.53,>> I just might have to stay over here.
518,00:34:19.13,00:34:19.13,">> I'd be lying if I said, you know, I won't go to Tribal"
519,00:34:21.47,00:34:21.47,"Council with a certain amount of fear, but I feel as confident as"
520,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,I could... that everything at
521,00:34:27.77,00:34:27.77,this point is going to go according to plan.
522,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,>> Everybody ready? >> If tonight is played
523,00:34:32.20,00:34:32.20,"straightforward, it should be four votes to one, Jerri Manthey"
524,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,"going home, but as we've all known from the get-go, it's a"
525,00:34:37.23,00:34:37.23,game of curveballs. If Jerri feels as though her
526,00:34:40.30,00:34:40.30,"back's against the wall, who knows what she could pull out?"
527,00:34:43.10,00:34:43.10,That is another reason why she needs to go tonight.
528,00:35:07.87,00:35:07.87,>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
529,00:35:10.70,00:35:10.70,Let's talk about today's challenge.
530,00:35:13.03,00:35:13.03,"Reward and immunity and access to one of your tribe members,"
531,00:35:17.13,00:35:17.13,"which could potentially be devastating, if they give up"
532,00:35:20.07,00:35:20.07,"information. What happened, Ethan?"
533,00:35:22.63,00:35:22.63,You guys had a huge lead going into the jungle.
534,00:35:24.60,00:35:24.60,">> Huge is, you know, a matter of opinion, Jeff."
535,00:35:27.07,00:35:27.07,">> PROBST: Pretty big. >> Nah, okay."
536,00:35:28.60,00:35:28.60,"No, you're right. Um, I take full responsibility"
537,00:35:30.83,00:35:30.83,for what happened with the challenge today.
538,00:35:32.97,00:35:32.97,"I feel horrible about it. I feel bad I let my team down,"
539,00:35:35.80,00:35:35.80,"let myself down, uh, and it's embarrassing."
540,00:35:38.17,00:35:38.17,I don't want to lose to Rob. I don't want to lose to Chapera.
541,00:35:41.10,00:35:41.10,">> PROBST: Colby, it seems like there's a little bit of"
542,00:35:43.97,00:35:43.97,animosity between these two tribes.
543,00:35:45.87,00:35:45.87,>> Yeah. I agree with Ethan.
544,00:35:48.40,00:35:48.40,I hated losing to Rob. I don't think any of us are
545,00:35:51.90,00:35:51.90,looking forward to a merge. Coexisting and cohabitating with
546,00:35:55.90,00:35:55.90,those guys is not something I'm looking forward to.
547,00:35:58.33,00:35:58.33,">> PROBST: Lex, are you guys really already thinking about a"
548,00:36:00.97,00:36:00.97,merge? >> All of us are definitely
549,00:36:03.47,00:36:03.47,"thinking about a merge. I mean, every time we go to a"
550,00:36:05.47,00:36:05.47,"challenge and see these other players, we're sizing them up."
551,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,">> PROBST: So, it stands to reason, if you're looking at"
552,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,"Chapera and thinking who's going to be a threat, you must"
553,00:36:12.57,00:36:12.57,be looking at your own tribe already and thinking who's
554,00:36:14.90,00:36:14.90,going to be a threat. >> You better believe it.
555,00:36:16.73,00:36:16.73,"Absolutely. Who's going to be a threat, and"
556,00:36:18.97,00:36:18.97,who's going to be somebody that can help you...
557,00:36:21.23,00:36:21.23,"in a post-merge situation. >> PROBST: Jerri, so how do you"
558,00:36:25.10,00:36:25.10,navigate this one? Because it's still a tribal
559,00:36:27.53,00:36:27.53,"game. >> When I vote, I vote..."
560,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,"for the person I find to be my biggest threat, because that"
561,00:36:34.17,00:36:34.17,definitely comes into play at a merge.
562,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,That is something that you have to consider throughout the
563,00:36:39.37,00:36:39.37,entire course of the game. >> And I disagree with that.
564,00:36:42.30,00:36:42.30,"I'm sorry, if you're not through, I'll let you finish."
565,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,">> No, go ahead. >> We're here because we lost."
566,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,We can't afford to lose again. It doesn't make sense to start
567,00:36:50.27,00:36:50.27,"eliminating people that you know, in some capacity, will"
568,00:36:53.73,00:36:53.73,"help you compete. To me, it just doesn't make"
569,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,sense to start cutting your legs off.
570,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,">> PROBST: Shii Ann, who could this tribe most afford to lose,"
571,00:37:01.90,00:37:01.90,"from a physical point of view? >> Well, from a physical point"
572,00:37:05.23,00:37:05.23,"of view, it would probably be me or Jerri."
573,00:37:07.30,00:37:07.30,We're physically possibly the weakest tribe members here.
574,00:37:10.60,00:37:10.60,"I'm sorry, Jerri, to speak for you..."
575,00:37:12.20,00:37:12.20,">> Yeah, please don't. >> ...but physically I think"
576,00:37:13.60,00:37:13.60,we... But I would hate for this vote
577,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,"to be purely based on physical strength, because obviously,"
578,00:37:21.23,00:37:21.23,then... I might be the next to
579,00:37:23.63,00:37:23.63,"go, and I would not like to go at this time."
580,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23,">> PROBST: Jerri, do you agree with Shii Ann?"
581,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,Are you possibly one of the weakest links on this tribe?
582,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,">> Um... well, I'm really good at putting puzzles together."
583,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,"(laughs) Um, I'm good at strategizing."
584,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,And I feel like I am an uplifting member who is
585,00:37:43.03,00:37:43.03,"generally in a good mood and keeping spirits high, and I feel"
586,00:37:47.97,00:37:47.97,"I have a lot to offer. >> PROBST: Shii Ann, who could"
587,00:37:51.20,00:37:51.20,the tribe least afford to lose from a physical point of view?
588,00:37:54.27,00:37:54.27,">> Sorry, Ethan, I have to say that Colby is physically the"
589,00:37:57.40,00:37:57.40,strongest member of this tribe. He's a very valuable member.
590,00:38:01.13,00:38:01.13,"Strongest physically, definitely Colby."
591,00:38:03.43,00:38:03.43,">> PROBST: So, Colby, does that make you feel secure hearing"
592,00:38:05.70,00:38:05.70,"that, that you are leading the tribe?"
593,00:38:09.00,00:38:09.00,">> My first thought was, wow, that really puts me out"
594,00:38:12.30,00:38:12.30,there for... when we do get to
595,00:38:14.77,00:38:14.77,that point where it is individual.
596,00:38:16.27,00:38:16.27,"No offense to you, Shii Ann, but..."
597,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,"but, yeah, that's weird. My first thought was, wow, I"
598,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,"don't feel secure now, I feel vulnerable, because I've just"
599,00:38:24.47,00:38:24.47,been pointed out as the strongest guy in this tribe.
600,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,Do they see me as the guy they've got to get rid of?
601,00:38:29.83,00:38:29.83,">> PROBST: Lex, you think the person voted out tonight's gonna"
602,00:38:32.20,00:38:32.20,"be shocked? >> Tonight, on our tribe,"
603,00:38:34.03,00:38:34.03,the only person that doesn't have to worry about loyalty and
604,00:38:36.33,00:38:36.33,"worry about the shock of being voted out is Kathy, who's"
605,00:38:39.27,00:38:39.27,whooping it up with Chapera. There's gonna be nothing fun
606,00:38:42.30,00:38:42.30,"about it. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
607,00:38:44.80,00:38:44.80,"vote. Ethan, you're up."
608,00:38:58.63,00:38:58.63,">> Jerri... you're two-faced, so... bye."
609,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,>> You and I both know that this game has absolutely nothing
610,00:39:13.80,00:39:13.80,to do with friendship. I had to make a hard call and
611,00:39:16.57,00:39:16.57,it meant taking you out. >> Is this a revenge vote?
612,00:39:39.57,00:39:39.57,"Hell, yeah. >> You have underestimated my"
613,00:39:51.63,00:39:51.63,powers. Perhaps you should spend some
614,00:39:54.33,00:39:54.33,time analyzing your own. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
615,00:40:05.30,00:40:05.30,votes. >> PROBST: Once the votes are
616,00:40:24.47,00:40:24.47,"read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
617,00:40:26.70,00:40:26.70,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
618,00:40:28.67,00:40:28.67,I'll read the votes. First vote...
619,00:40:34.03,00:40:34.03,Colby. Colby.
620,00:40:39.47,00:40:39.47,That's two votes Colby. Jerri.
621,00:40:45.70,00:40:45.70,"Two votes Colby, one vote Jerri. Jerri."
622,00:40:51.83,00:40:51.83,"Two votes Jerri, two votes Colby."
623,00:40:53.80,00:40:53.80,I'll read the last vote. The seventh person voted out of
624,00:40:58.70,00:40:58.70,the tribe... Colby.
625,00:41:02.37,00:41:02.37,"Need to bring me your torch. Colby, the tribe has spoken."
626,00:41:20.80,00:41:20.80,"There you go. Well, based on tonight's vote,"
627,00:41:33.23,00:41:33.23,"it seems that the prevailing wisdom, Mogo Mogo, is to vote"
628,00:41:36.63,00:41:36.63,out the person you think will be most threatening if and when it
629,00:41:39.70,00:41:39.70,becomes an individual game. Interesting strategy.
630,00:41:42.97,00:41:42.97,We'll see if it pays off or not. You guys can head back to camp.
631,00:41:45.90,00:41:45.90,Kathy'll be waiting for you when you get there.

636,00:42:05.73,00:42:05.73,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor...
637,00:42:11.63,00:42:11.63,Rob and Amber finally connect. >> He's getting me
638,00:42:13.90,00:42:13.90,"through this game, and I think I'm getting him through, too."
639,00:42:16.37,00:42:16.37,>> Amber is slammin'. >> PROBST: Both tribes select
640,00:42:18.93,00:42:18.93,"ambassadors. >> ""Pick one representative to"

644,00:42:27.03,00:42:27.03,city kid from Boston. >> Tonight was probably
645,00:42:41.00,00:42:41.00,as polar opposite from my first experience in Survivor.
646,00:42:44.90,00:42:44.90,"Every Tribal Council, I was never voted out."
647,00:42:47.20,00:42:47.20,But the inevitable bonus of playing this game again is
648,00:42:50.33,00:42:50.33,"simply, once again, proving to yourself that you can do it."
649,00:42:53.53,00:42:53.53,"And, ultimately, when your day's up, you got to be okay with"
650,00:42:55.73,00:42:55.73,that. You got to feel good about what
651,00:42:57.60,00:42:57.60,you've done.
