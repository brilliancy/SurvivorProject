5,00:00:10.92,00:00:10.92,informed Earl. >> I would have never thought

8,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,and Edgardo found the idol hidden at their camp.
9,00:00:26.21,00:00:26.21,They made a pact not to tell Lisi or Dreamz.
10,00:00:29.17,00:00:29.17,">> Dreamz is not so good about keeping his trap shut, so we're"
11,00:00:32.21,00:00:32.21,doing it for his protection and our own.
12,00:00:33.92,00:00:33.92,>> PROBST: Lisi had no idea that the idol had been found.
13,00:00:36.79,00:00:36.79,">> A little idol digging? I'm, like, ""Dude, you're gonna"
14,00:00:39.00,00:00:39.00,"have to wake up really, really early to fool an old cat like"

19,00:00:51.83,00:00:51.83,">> Moto. (cheering, shouting)"
20,00:00:55.54,00:00:55.54,">> All right, then. >> PROBST: Lisi was banished to"
21,00:00:57.46,00:00:57.46,"Exile Island, where she broke down."
22,00:01:00.04,00:01:00.04,">> I really don't want to be here, but what am I supposed to"

29,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,">> I don't see you guys winning the next Reward Challenge, and"
30,00:01:25.92,00:01:25.92,that means I get to go to Exile Island again.
31,00:01:28.17,00:01:28.17,>> PROBST: When Lisi threw in the towel...
32,00:01:29.83,00:01:29.83,">> I'm done like a Thanksgiving Day turkey, man."
33,00:01:32.92,00:01:32.92,(clucks like a turkey) >> The fact that Lisi wants to
34,00:01:35.12,00:01:35.12,"quit pissed me off, because I could probably use her in the"
35,00:01:37.79,00:01:37.79,future. >> PROBST: But Lisi had second

43,00:01:57.75,00:01:57.75,">> Well, I have to think for a minute, I have to just chill..."
44,00:02:00.04,00:02:00.04,">> Jeff, I'm ready to vote. >> PROBST: In the end, Lisi's"
45,00:02:03.04,00:02:03.04,indecisiveness got her unanimously voted off.
46,00:02:06.33,00:02:06.33,"Lisi, the tribe has spoken. Ten are left."
47,00:02:10.71,00:02:10.71,Who will be voted out tonight? (sizzling)
48,00:02:32.25,00:02:32.25,>> Do you have the idol now with you?
49,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,"Hey, put it here, man. Are you sure?"
50,00:02:38.79,00:02:38.79,>> Yeah. >> And if you use it against

52,00:02:42.62,00:02:42.62,>> Okay. The idol I have in my pocket is
53,00:02:44.12,00:02:44.12,"actually for... You know, I'm selfish."
54,00:02:48.62,00:02:48.62,"I'll admit it in this game. It's for myself, to get myself"
55,00:02:51.46,00:02:51.46,"further along in this game. Now, if that plays into my"
56,00:02:54.62,00:02:54.62,"alliance with these guys, to use these guys to get further, then"
57,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,"I'll, you know, I'm all for it. >> We're placing our faith in"
58,00:03:00.75,00:03:00.75,"you, man. Okay, fair enough."
59,00:03:11.38,00:03:11.38,">> Dreamz, hey, man. >> Edgardo, Mookie and myself"
60,00:03:17.25,00:03:17.25,have not told Dreamz about the Immunity Idol.
61,00:03:19.67,00:03:19.67,Not because we want to keep it from him so that we can use it
62,00:03:23.29,00:03:23.29,"against him, but really, it's just because we don't think"
63,00:03:26.33,00:03:26.33,Dreamz is good about keeping information to himself.
64,00:03:32.50,00:03:32.50,">> Not bad at all. >> I know, but one at a time,"
65,00:03:39.21,00:03:39.21,you know? >> Tree Mail!
66,00:04:03.00,00:04:03.00,>> It's not a good Tree Mail. >> Uh-oh.
67,00:04:05.67,00:04:05.67,">> ""Gather your personal belongings only, and use the map"

71,00:04:20.54,00:04:20.54,>> We need to boil up the rest of that rice.
72,00:04:22.75,00:04:22.75,">> Boil it up, boil it up. >> Boil it up."
73,00:04:24.12,00:04:24.12,>> Boil it up. >> Are we living on Exile
74,00:04:25.92,00:04:25.92,"Island for the rest of the time? We got Tree Mail, and we're"
75,00:04:29.04,00:04:29.04,"like, ""Oh, man, we're leaving our camp."""
76,00:04:31.33,00:04:31.33,"You know, this sucks. >> Nope."
77,00:04:35.29,00:04:35.29,">> The fact that I've been through, you know, the old Ravu"
78,00:04:38.04,00:04:38.04,"situation, I know I can sleep in the dirt and not eat a lot"
79,00:04:42.83,00:04:42.83,of food for a while. Me and Earl actually exchanged
80,00:04:46.21,00:04:46.21,"places, and we were like, ""This is great."
81,00:04:48.12,00:04:48.12,"We can totally do this."" Cassandra, Stacy and Boo have"
82,00:04:51.25,00:04:51.25,"been living the whole time on Honeymoon Fiji here, and they're"

85,00:05:04.00,00:05:04.00,>> Is this mail? >> Is this mail?
86,00:05:07.08,00:05:07.08,>> This is a map. >> It's a map.

93,00:05:29.96,00:05:29.96,Island. That's where we stay now.
94,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,We all merge at Exile Island. What do you think about that?
95,00:05:34.75,00:05:34.75,>> We're ready. >> I think we're merging.
96,00:05:36.50,00:05:36.50,">> All right, guys, um, so, all right, let's do it, man."
97,00:05:40.08,00:05:40.08,>> Let's do it. >> I don't know what to expect
98,00:05:41.50,00:05:41.50,right now. The game takes so many twists.
99,00:05:43.62,00:05:43.62,"I'm hoping for a merge, but if it's not, I mean, it's part of"
100,00:05:47.25,00:05:47.25,"the game. >> All right, so we need to be"
101,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,clear on who we're targeting. We're targeting Cassandra.
102,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,>> I'm getting Cassandra. >> You're Michelle?
103,00:05:57.83,00:05:57.83,Let's target Stacy. >> So the master plan is
104,00:06:00.42,00:06:00.42,"basically, if we merge, Dreamz tries to pull Cassandra over,"
105,00:06:03.79,00:06:03.79,"giving us five-five, Mookie tries to pull Michelle or"
106,00:06:06.96,00:06:06.96,"Yau-Man, and I think I can pull Stacy."
107,00:06:09.58,00:06:09.58,>> Remember this time right here.
108,00:06:10.75,00:06:10.75,Remember how we felt when we was here.
109,00:06:12.08,00:06:12.08,"Ain't nobody gonna turn back, you know what I'm saying?"
110,00:06:14.21,00:06:14.21,">> And the bottom line is, each of us has proven our loyalty to"
111,00:06:17.08,00:06:17.08,the other by essentially giving up someone we were aligned with
112,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,"for the sake of the four, the four horsemen."
113,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,You gave up Rock. We gave up Lisi.
114,00:06:25.08,00:06:25.08,"Right now, we have to get nasty, and we have to use everything"
115,00:06:27.21,00:06:27.21,that we have. >> Yeah.
116,00:06:36.04,00:06:36.04,(theme song playing) \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
117,00:08:05.75,00:08:05.75,">> Everybody's a bit nervous. Uh, we don't know if a merge is"
118,00:08:08.67,00:08:08.67,coming up or how it's going to work.
119,00:08:10.96,00:08:10.96,People pretty much wracked their brains trying to figure out
120,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,"what's going to happen next, and I think that everybody is"
121,00:08:16.67,00:08:16.67,depending on this merge because they're nervous.
122,00:08:19.08,00:08:19.08,>> They're coming. They're right there.
123,00:08:20.88,00:08:20.88,>> So you get dependent on something.
124,00:08:22.54,00:08:22.54,"""Well, I know I'm going to be safe once I get my boys back."""
125,00:08:26.88,00:08:26.88,"But hey, there might not be a merge."
126,00:08:29.08,00:08:29.08,"I mean, you just never know. What took you so long?"
127,00:08:32.12,00:08:32.12,Instead of thinking so far ahead about this merge and depending
128,00:08:35.12,00:08:35.12,on that... Back again.
129,00:08:36.79,00:08:36.79,...you better think about right now who's watching you and might
130,00:08:39.08,00:08:39.08,want to vote you off tomorrow. >> When we got to Exile Island
131,00:08:45.83,00:08:45.83,"and we met up with each other, we greeted each other."
132,00:08:48.21,00:08:48.21,">> Hey, Yau, how you doing? >> Hi, baby!"
133,00:08:50.71,00:08:50.71,>> And some of us thought a merge is happening.
134,00:08:52.79,00:08:52.79,Others thought that there's a big party waiting for us
135,00:08:55.04,00:08:55.04,"somewhere. Uh, we still have our own colors"
136,00:08:57.79,00:08:57.79,"and our own flags with us, so we have no idea what's going on."
137,00:09:01.04,00:09:01.04,>> Where are we going here? Are we going in there?
138,00:09:02.58,00:09:02.58,>> Yeah. >> Let's check it out.
139,00:09:03.83,00:09:03.83,">> Here we go again. >> When we got to Exile Island,"
140,00:09:06.17,00:09:06.17,there was no instruction. Jeff wasn't around.
141,00:09:08.62,00:09:08.62,"Um, I thought we were just kind of going to live on Exile"
142,00:09:11.42,00:09:11.42,Island. We assumed maybe all ten of us
143,00:09:14.00,00:09:14.00,"were going to live there and it's going to suck, but hey, at"
144,00:09:15.67,00:09:15.67,"least we came from Ravu, where it kind of sucks anyway, so"
145,00:09:17.62,00:09:17.62,whatever. (Cassandra sighs)
146,00:09:23.92,00:09:23.92,>> We decided to go to the top of the tower to see if there was
147,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,Tree Mail. The entire tribe made it up
148,00:09:29.17,00:09:29.17,together. We got into our own little tree
149,00:09:31.29,00:09:31.29,"house, expecting that this was where we were going to be for a"
150,00:09:33.67,00:09:33.67,while. >> Fishing is how to do it.
151,00:09:39.88,00:09:39.88,">> What the hell, then? >> Is this the cannibalism part?"
152,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,">> Look at that! >> Oh, wow."
153,00:09:47.08,00:09:47.08,>> New colors! New buffs.
154,00:09:49.08,00:09:49.08,">> Finally, I get rid of the orange."
155,00:09:50.83,00:09:50.83,">> No orange. >> All right, everyone got their"
156,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,"buffs? >> ""Congratulations, you have"
157,00:09:55.46,00:09:55.46,made it far and now merged into one tribe.
158,00:09:58.79,00:09:58.79,Drop your old buffs and wear these new ones with pride as
159,00:10:01.46,00:10:01.46,"you paddle in one boat to your home, the old Moto camp."""
160,00:10:06.00,00:10:06.00,( cheering ) >> I get to see Moto!
161,00:10:12.25,00:10:12.25,"For once, I get to see Moto and experience that island because"
162,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00,I am the only person that has not been there yet.
163,00:10:19.38,00:10:19.38,So we're all going to be back there.
164,00:10:24.04,00:10:24.04,>> I'm so elated to be going back to Moto.
165,00:10:26.04,00:10:26.04,"I was thinking, ""Oh, Lord, how am I going to make it on Exile"
166,00:10:28.71,00:10:28.71,"Island? We're going to be with snakes,"
167,00:10:30.46,00:10:30.46,"and no bed, no couch. Lord, please, what are we going"
168,00:10:36.67,00:10:36.67,"to do?"" So, um, oh, my God, I am so"
169,00:10:39.04,00:10:39.04,elated. >> Whoo!
170,00:10:51.33,00:10:51.33,>> All right! >> Whoo!
171,00:10:54.08,00:10:54.08,">> Thank God, after seven days of hell at Ravu, I get to eat"
172,00:10:58.96,00:10:58.96,"rice, potatoes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a shower, and I"
173,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,"smell like crap, I know. I'll probably get a turn"
174,00:11:06.50,00:11:06.50,"turn at the bed tonight. Finally, finally, things are"
175,00:11:09.83,00:11:09.83,looking up. >> Let's see if we have
176,00:11:12.04,00:11:12.04,"surprises. >> See if we have a flag,"
177,00:11:14.17,00:11:14.17,"a new name. >> Oh, my God!"
178,00:11:20.12,00:11:20.12,"Oh, my God! >> I can't even get a bed?!"
179,00:11:23.75,00:11:23.75,">> They took everything. >> I didn't, I didn't get"
180,00:11:26.21,00:11:26.21,anything. >> Fishing gear.
181,00:11:30.08,00:11:30.08,">> Oh, what the hell?! >> Oh, my God!"
182,00:11:33.21,00:11:33.21,">> Oh, no! This is, like, a bad dream."
183,00:11:36.21,00:11:36.21,">> This is, like, this is so messed up."
184,00:11:38.29,00:11:38.29,"Oh, my God! >> Bastards!"
185,00:11:53.62,00:11:53.62,">> Oh, my God! >> This is so not cool."
186,00:11:57.79,00:11:57.79,>> This is real Survivor. We have a cave.

188,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,we got a cave. >> And that's it.
189,00:12:03.79,00:12:03.79,That's all we need. >> We've already been trained
190,00:12:05.46,00:12:05.46,for this. >> When we got on to the Moto
191,00:12:07.88,00:12:07.88,"beach, turned the corner, and lo and behold, nothing."
192,00:12:11.88,00:12:11.88,I mean nothing. We got a little bit of fishing
193,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,"gear, a couple of pots, a machete, a flint, and that's it."
194,00:12:21.04,00:12:21.04,>> I've never seen Moto. >> You never did get to see
195,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,"Moto, did you? >> Never got a bed."
196,00:12:26.83,00:12:26.83,I never a toothbrush. I never got anything.
197,00:12:37.42,00:12:37.42,">> Everything was gone. No bed, no couch, no shelter,"
198,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,"no bathroom, no nothing. I felt okay with that."
199,00:12:46.04,00:12:46.04,I kind of laughed. Had a little smirk on my face
200,00:12:48.83,00:12:48.83,because I've already been trained.
201,00:12:51.42,00:12:51.42,"You know, being at the old Ravu for 13 days-- hey, I'm just back"
202,00:12:56.17,00:12:56.17,home again. >> Everybody has the same way
203,00:12:58.79,00:12:58.79,"now, so. >> Good."
204,00:13:00.42,00:13:00.42,">> All right, well... >> Everybody gather around for"
205,00:13:02.04,00:13:02.04,the mail. All right.
206,00:13:05.04,00:13:05.04,"""Now it is time to reveal your world from scratch."
207,00:13:07.88,00:13:07.88,"Give yourself a new name, paint your new flag, and start the"
208,00:13:11.08,00:13:11.08,"game anew."" >> That's it?"
209,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,">> Yeah, that's it. >> Let's do it."
210,00:13:15.79,00:13:15.79,">> All right. >> Okay, what's the name, guys?"
211,00:13:17.46,00:13:17.46,>> Something that has to do with the islands or something
212,00:13:19.54,00:13:19.54,I don't know. >> Venaca.
213,00:13:21.75,00:13:21.75,">> Isn't Venaca ""thank you""? >> Thank you."
214,00:13:24.12,00:13:24.12,">> And ""Bula"" is hello. >> Let's do Bula."
215,00:13:26.21,00:13:26.21,>> Bula-Bula. >> I... I vote for that.
216,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,>> Bula-Bula. >> Bula-Bula it is.
217,00:13:30.25,00:13:30.25,">> Bula-Bula. >> Either that, either that or"
218,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,the nooky-nooky tribe. >> Bula-nooky.
219,00:13:35.46,00:13:35.46,>> Bula-looky-nooky. >> Hello.
220,00:13:37.46,00:13:37.46,">> So who's good, who's good at drawing?"
221,00:13:39.75,00:13:39.75,>> Me and Stacy? >> We decided on Bula-Bula as
222,00:13:45.04,00:13:45.04,"the tribe name because ""Bula"" is how you say ""hello"" in Fiji."
223,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,>> On the flag itself or on what-what's going on here?
224,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,">> The flag. >> No, I wanted to look at our"
225,00:13:58.17,00:13:58.17,canvas. We can never be so sure in this
226,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,"game, you know. >> I know."
227,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,">> We want to be in a safe spot. I think we are now, don't you?"
228,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,">> Yeah, yeah. I'm a little worried because you"
229,00:14:11.04,00:14:11.04,"guys are all still super close. >> Yeah, but the thing is,"
230,00:14:13.50,00:14:13.50,"Michelle, is  that I don't that think that we're a threat"
231,00:14:15.83,00:14:15.83,"because we're girls, and those guys are going to get super"
232,00:14:18.29,00:14:18.29,"competitive. It's interesting, I think boys"
233,00:14:21.12,00:14:21.12,are going to start attacking boys and getting them off game
234,00:14:23.75,00:14:23.75,"before they're going to touch the girls, because they look at"
235,00:14:26.25,00:14:26.25,"us as non-threats. So we'll be, like, the last to"
236,00:14:28.83,00:14:28.83,go. I mean that's how it's lined up
237,00:14:31.12,00:14:31.12,for now. We're in a pretty good spot.
238,00:14:34.75,00:14:34.75,>> Now I'm like-- now I'm thinking like the other island
239,00:14:37.00,00:14:37.00,"is better. >> As far as fishing, yeah."
240,00:14:39.04,00:14:39.04,>> Because we could get more food.
241,00:14:41.08,00:14:41.08,>> Like crabs. We're a new tribe now.
242,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,But there-there's a core group. There's a tribe within the tribe
243,00:14:45.88,00:14:45.88,"and the tribe within the tribe is myself, Michelle, Cassandra,"
244,00:14:50.04,00:14:50.04,and Yau. Now it's just divide and
245,00:14:52.83,00:14:52.83,conquer. We have to kind of divide up
246,00:14:55.12,00:14:55.12,that old Moto and get them one by one and knock them out.
247,00:14:58.54,00:14:58.54,">> What do you all want to do? >> Yeah, let's divide everything"
248,00:15:02.38,00:15:02.38,up and just get-get going. So the moment has final arrived.
249,00:15:07.17,00:15:07.17,These first couple of hours are really crucial.
250,00:15:10.58,00:15:10.58,They're going to determine who's the final five.
251,00:15:13.25,00:15:13.25,"I'm ready to fight. >> All right, so who's going to"
252,00:15:16.33,00:15:16.33,go fishing? >> I can go.
253,00:15:18.08,00:15:18.08,">> I'll go. >> Let's go us four, then."
254,00:15:20.04,00:15:20.04,>> There are two slings. Two people can be crabbing while
255,00:15:22.12,00:15:22.12,another couple of people can sit on the boat and try to fish.
256,00:15:24.75,00:15:24.75,>> I had my niche in the first Moto tribe.
257,00:15:27.58,00:15:27.58,I had my niche in the second Moto tribe and I was very
258,00:15:30.17,00:15:30.17,"comfortable. At this point, I'm not"
259,00:15:32.21,00:15:32.21,"comfortable at all, so I'm going-going to take a backseat."
260,00:15:35.25,00:15:35.25,"And that's all I can do is be a good little helper, and then"
261,00:15:38.88,00:15:38.88,"when it's time, I'll assume leadership role again."
262,00:15:46.79,00:15:46.79,>> How was camp over here? >> It was good.
263,00:15:48.62,00:15:48.62,"It was nice. We had a good little, um, thing"
264,00:15:50.88,00:15:50.88,going. >> Me and Dreamz hooked up at
265,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,"Ravu, so we got good. >> I was hoping that."
266,00:15:55.17,00:15:55.17,"I was hoping that. >> Yeah, I mean we clicked and"
267,00:15:57.25,00:15:57.25,"then... he said, you and I saw-- I said, you know me and Yau,"
268,00:16:00.08,00:16:00.08,like I trust Yau at Ravu. >> And Earl and Michelle.
269,00:16:02.71,00:16:02.71,">> Am I still one who trusts someone, Yau?"
270,00:16:05.00,00:16:05.00,>> Yeah. >> Or have I left?
271,00:16:08.04,00:16:08.04,">> No, I didn't go to the dark side."
272,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,">> We were all afraid. >> First second, we got onto"
273,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,"this island, four horsemen as we discussed-- we were going to"
274,00:16:16.33,00:16:16.33,go split up and figure out what was happening at Moto.
275,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,"And so we went straight to work, and infiltrated that group and"
276,00:16:22.58,00:16:22.58,kind of gained their trust. >> Are you guys good with Boo?
277,00:16:26.96,00:16:26.96,"Do you guys like him or...? >> Oh, no."
278,00:16:29.25,00:16:29.25,I'm a... >> He goes first.
279,00:16:30.88,00:16:30.88,>> We can't decide whether it's Boo or Stacy.
280,00:16:33.04,00:16:33.04,"Stacy because we don't want the Alex connection, but now that"
281,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,we merged... Yeah.
282,00:16:38.25,00:16:38.25,">> And that's the thing, Boo just stirs up too much..."
283,00:16:40.08,00:16:40.08,">> He gets it going quick. >> Yeah, he stirs too much."
284,00:16:42.17,00:16:42.17,"You gotta get him out before he starts, like..."
285,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,">> Mm-hmm. >> Right away, we found they"
286,00:16:47.25,00:16:47.25,"want Boo out, and then we take out Stacy."
287,00:16:49.54,00:16:49.54,"Right now, our plan is working out perfectly as far as what we"
288,00:16:52.12,00:16:52.12,know. We just have to execute it
289,00:16:54.42,00:16:54.42,"right. >> So, Boo first?"
290,00:16:56.42,00:16:56.42,>> Boo first. And then Stacy or Alex.
291,00:17:02.75,00:17:02.75,">> Currently, I'm the only one with the idol, and Earl is the"
292,00:17:05.17,00:17:05.17,only one who knows I have the idol.
293,00:17:07.71,00:17:07.71,"Potentially, there should be two immunity idols in play right now"
294,00:17:11.12,00:17:11.12,in the game. The question is who's got the
295,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,other one? The next opportunity we have we
296,00:17:15.62,00:17:15.62,"would like to vote out Boo, and I think we have pretty much"
297,00:17:19.12,00:17:19.12,"secure Mookie's and Dreamz's votes, but we don't trust nobody"
298,00:17:23.92,00:17:23.92,"here. >> Oh, it's so cute!"
299,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,">> There you go! >> Yeah, he goes first."
300,00:17:41.12,00:17:41.12,For sure. >> I really have a lot of trust
301,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,"in Alex, because we're both original Moto, and that's just,"
302,00:17:48.00,00:17:48.00,"you know, the chance that I'm taking."
303,00:17:50.04,00:17:50.04,But he's the most trustworthy person that I can think of right
304,00:17:52.62,00:17:52.62,"now. >> I mean, I think we should do"
305,00:17:55.21,00:17:55.21,"what's most convenient for us. You know, me, you, and Ed are"
306,00:17:57.67,00:17:57.67,tighter-- are going to be tighter together than whoever
307,00:18:00.17,00:18:00.17,it is that's around. >> And then we-we also are more
308,00:18:04.38,00:18:04.38,"solid, too, on a vote. >> Yeah, we're more solid..."
309,00:18:06.71,00:18:06.71,>> Against two. >> I can use the relationships
310,00:18:10.25,00:18:10.25,"I've had to sort of create smoke and mirrors, to keep them sort"
311,00:18:13.79,00:18:13.79,"of guessing, so that, you know, the four horsemen can take it"
312,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,"all the way. Unless I'm mistaken, the four of"
313,00:18:18.54,00:18:18.54,us are controlling this game right now.
314,00:18:20.58,00:18:20.58,"I could be wrong, and I could be getting set up, but this is"
315,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,my best bet. What can I do?
316,00:18:25.42,00:18:25.42,I know you're smart. I'm not worried about you.
317,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,I just wanted you have all the information I have.
318,00:18:30.04,00:18:30.04,">> No, I appreciate it. >> We all want Boo off."
319,00:18:40.21,00:18:40.21,">> Yeah, so Boo's going to go off first."
320,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,>> And then we're going to get Stacy off second.
321,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,>> The thing is-- yeah... >> Okay.
322,00:18:53.08,00:18:53.08,">> All of a sudden, Mookie let Dreamz know that we had the"
323,00:18:57.38,00:18:57.38,"idol, and as soon as that happened, my gut was like, ""Ooh,"
324,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"that was not so smart."" But you can't say a ... word."
325,00:19:04.25,00:19:04.25,>> You can't say... >> Do I look like...? Shut up.
326,00:19:06.62,00:19:06.62," >> No, no, no, no, just... >> I'm not... no, I'm not..."
327,00:19:08.71,00:19:08.71,">> Don't tell, don't tell Cassandra."
328,00:19:10.71,00:19:10.71,">> When Alex and Mookie told me that they had the immunity idol,"
329,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,I was kind of mad because they didn't tell me when they first
330,00:19:15.25,00:19:15.25,found it. >> Just a few days ago.
331,00:19:17.33,00:19:17.33,>> Why didn't y'all tell me? >> 'Cause we didn't...
332,00:19:19.67,00:19:19.67,">> Only because of Cassandra, just to make sure."
333,00:19:22.08,00:19:22.08,"But we were going to tell you. >> We had a pact, and they kind"
334,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,of made me not trust them a little bit and-and made me feel
335,00:19:28.29,00:19:28.29,"that I was on the outskirts. So, point-blank, I'm going to"
336,00:19:31.00,00:19:31.00,trust them until I can't trust them no more.
337,00:19:33.04,00:19:33.04,"Strange. No, I wouldn't have said"
338,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,anything. I'm glad you all told me now
339,00:19:37.25,00:19:37.25,because I was getting kind of scared.
340,00:19:39.17,00:19:39.17,I-I was getting kind of scared about...
341,00:19:41.04,00:19:41.04,>> ...now it works perfect. >> Now is everything's perfect.
342,00:19:44.08,00:19:44.08,"Let's do it, y'all. Don't screw up."
343,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,No more talk. >> Dreamz knows about the
344,00:19:55.88,00:19:55.88,"immunity idol, by the way. >> Who told him?"
345,00:19:58.75,00:19:58.75,>> Mookie wanted to tell him. >> You told Dreamz about the
346,00:20:01.17,00:20:01.17,"idol, man? >> Why?"
347,00:20:03.58,00:20:03.58,">> All right, I'm going to tell you right now, I don't like that"
348,00:20:06.17,00:20:06.17,plan. Like not-not that I don't trust
349,00:20:08.04,00:20:08.04,"you, but trusting all these people..."
350,00:20:09.58,00:20:09.58,">> No, no, either way, we're taking out Boo first."
351,00:20:11.62,00:20:11.62,That's-that's everyone's consensus.
352,00:20:13.62,00:20:13.62,>> I'm pissed off about the whole situation right now.
353,00:20:15.67,00:20:15.67,"We found the immunity idol. It's something that, you know,"
354,00:20:18.12,00:20:18.12,you need to keep between three or two people to make it work.
355,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,"That's all the people that needed to be told, and Mookie"
356,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,just told Dreamz out of nowhere. And now I feel really
357,00:20:27.12,00:20:27.12,uncomfortable because Dreamz has the... knows about the idol;
358,00:20:29.79,00:20:29.79,Cassandra knows about the idol; Earl knows about the idol.
359,00:20:34.04,00:20:34.04,">> Do you get what I'm saying? >> Maybe-- I mean, I don't know"
360,00:20:37.12,00:20:37.12,"how you feel about this, but we should maybe just take Boo out"
361,00:20:39.54,00:20:39.54,"first, and then at that point Stacy has nowhere to go."
362,00:20:42.12,00:20:42.12,"And I trust Stacy. She's not gonna, she's not"
363,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,gonna... So we could pull her in.
364,00:20:48.21,00:20:48.21,That's five. That's a five-four majority.
365,00:20:51.88,00:20:51.88,"That's the simplest way. Stacy will be loyal, and we"
366,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,don't really have to worry about her winning the final
367,00:20:58.96,00:20:58.96,"immunity, I don't think. And we can put whatever order"
368,00:21:02.42,00:21:02.42,you want. I don't care.
369,00:21:06.88,00:21:06.88,">> I mean, that's fine. The original plan was to"
370,00:21:15.12,00:21:15.12,actually take out Boo and then Stacy.
371,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,Things changed. Alex and Edgardo want to bring
372,00:21:20.50,00:21:20.50,"Stacy. Now, bringing on Stacy is only"
373,00:21:23.38,00:21:23.38,"in their best interest, because they still have the"
374,00:21:26.21,00:21:26.21,"relationship from the old Moto. So when it gets down to five,"
375,00:21:30.25,00:21:30.25,"as we planned, Stacy is on their side, and me and Dreamz,"
376,00:21:34.21,00:21:34.21,"you know, we're left out of the loop."
377,00:21:37.96,00:21:37.96,">> If Dreamz tells somebody, I'm going to kill you, Mookie,"
378,00:21:40.12,00:21:40.12,"man, seriously. >> No one knows who has who."
379,00:21:59.29,00:21:59.29,>> Mm-hmm. >> And that's great.
380,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,>> Mm-hmm. (chuckles)
381,00:22:04.46,00:22:04.46,>> You're still the most popular girl here right now.
382,00:22:07.08,00:22:07.08,"You and Michelle, too, actually. >> Uh-huh."
383,00:22:10.21,00:22:10.21,>> Michelle's getting pretty popular.
384,00:22:11.62,00:22:11.62,">> Uh-huh. >> And long as they just,"
385,00:22:14.25,00:22:14.25,they don't pay any attention to Dreamz still.
386,00:22:17.08,00:22:17.08,">> Mm-hmm. >> I don't think, I still don't"
387,00:22:19.96,00:22:19.96,trust Mookie. >> Uh-huh.
388,00:22:22.50,00:22:22.50,"My alliance is with some of the people from Ravu side: Earl,"
389,00:22:26.75,00:22:26.75,Yau-Man. And then Earl has Michelle on
390,00:22:30.04,00:22:30.04,"his side, and then definitely Dreamz."
391,00:22:32.96,00:22:32.96,I was really hoping that he would make it through to the
392,00:22:36.00,00:22:36.00,merge. We've pretty much got the
393,00:22:37.25,00:22:37.25,"numbers on our side. >> Hey, just keep them thinking"
394,00:22:40.83,00:22:40.83,that they have you. Keep them thinking that I'm not
395,00:22:43.46,00:22:43.46,thinking. >> Mm-hmm.
396,00:22:46.21,00:22:46.21,"Yes, I'll definitely do that. That's easy."
397,00:22:48.71,00:22:48.71,>> We'll just sail on. I was actually happy about the
398,00:22:51.42,00:22:51.42,merge 'cause now the game is really on.
399,00:22:53.67,00:22:53.67,It's time to take it to the advanced level.
400,00:23:19.25,00:23:19.25,>> Let's see what's going on there.
401,00:23:21.25,00:23:21.25,">> I'm like, do I bring my shoes or do I run?"
402,00:23:32.42,00:23:32.42,>> What? >> Still Boo?
403,00:23:34.08,00:23:34.08,">> Boo, Stacy-- 'cause that's two out of the way."
404,00:23:36.08,00:23:36.08,>> What they're saying now is they want to keep Stacy on
405,00:23:39.92,00:23:39.92,board and use her the whole time to have majority.
406,00:23:43.46,00:23:43.46,">> That's me and you out. >> I know, I know, I know."
407,00:23:45.08,00:23:45.08,That's why I don't want to take Stacy with us.
408,00:23:47.25,00:23:47.25,">> No way, no, point blank, no. >> They just want Stacy on"
409,00:23:50.54,00:23:50.54,their side to take one of us off.
410,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,>> Take one of us off. >> Because we said guaranteed
411,00:23:54.04,00:23:54.04,five. >> Yeah.
412,00:23:55.04,00:23:55.04,">> Take one of us out, then he's gonna take us out."
413,00:23:57.12,00:23:57.12,That will bring too much into Alex's hands.
414,00:23:59.62,00:23:59.62,">> I ain't trusting nobody with Stacy around, you know what I"
415,00:24:01.54,00:24:01.54,mean? 'Cause they gonna always have
416,00:24:02.96,00:24:02.96,numbers with Stacy around. That's why I said Stacy second.
417,00:24:07.29,00:24:07.29,Do you understand? I was planning a long time ago.
418,00:24:09.50,00:24:09.50,I'm really looking forward to voting off Stacy because she
419,00:24:13.21,00:24:13.21,treated me so bad when I was with the old Moto.
420,00:24:15.54,00:24:15.54,"She treated Cassandra so bad, and all of a sudden she's happy"
421,00:24:17.79,00:24:17.79,and nice and glad to see me all of a sudden 'cause I got
422,00:24:20.21,00:24:20.21,friends and she ain't got the power no more.
423,00:24:22.54,00:24:22.54,"She's got to go. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
424,00:24:41.96,00:24:41.96,"I'll take that from you, Earl. You guys ready to get to"
425,00:24:50.96,00:24:50.96,today's challenge? >> Yep.
426,00:24:57.92,00:24:57.92,>> PROBST: Draw a stone. Do not look at it in your hand.
427,00:25:02.38,00:25:02.38,Separate bag for the ladies. Keep it covered.
428,00:25:14.21,00:25:14.21,"One left for you, Earl. Everybody, put your hands out."
429,00:25:22.25,00:25:22.25,"Everybody, reveal. If you have orange, go to the"
430,00:25:26.12,00:25:26.12,"orange mat. If you have green, go to the"
431,00:25:28.67,00:25:28.67,green mat. >> Another twist.
432,00:25:40.38,00:25:40.38,">> PROBST: Edgardo, you kind of shrugged your shoulders."
433,00:25:42.88,00:25:42.88,>> I don't know what to expect anymore.
434,00:25:44.67,00:25:44.67,"I'm just like, well, you know, bring it on."
435,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,Let's do it. Let's do this right now.
436,00:25:48.71,00:25:48.71,">> PROBST: Boo, what do you think's happening?"
437,00:25:50.46,00:25:50.46,>> I think we've switched again. >> PROBST: You have merged.
438,00:25:56.79,00:25:56.79,"You are one tribe, but for today's challenge, you will be"
439,00:26:00.04,00:26:00.04,competing against each other. You are two teams in this
440,00:26:04.33,00:26:04.33,"challenge. The green team will be Alex,"
441,00:26:07.33,00:26:07.33,"Michelle, Mookie, Stacy, and Dreamz."
442,00:26:10.58,00:26:10.58,"And the orange team: Edgardo, Cassandra, Boo, Yau-Man and"
443,00:26:15.71,00:26:15.71,"Earl. All right, should I tell you"
444,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,"about the challenge? >> Yes, please."
445,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,">> Yes, please. >> PROBST: On my go, you will be"
446,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,shown a large Fijian mask and given time to memorize the
447,00:26:24.54,00:26:24.54,symbols and their arrangement on the mask.
448,00:26:27.71,00:26:27.71,You will then paddle in your boat down the river to three
449,00:26:30.17,00:26:30.17,different stations. Each time you come to a
450,00:26:32.92,00:26:32.92,"station, you must retrieve a bundle of puzzle pieces."
451,00:26:37.38,00:26:37.38,"When you have all three bundles, you'll paddle to the"
452,00:26:40.08,00:26:40.08,finish. Two tribe members from each
453,00:26:42.38,00:26:42.38,team will then use those pieces to construct six of the symbols
454,00:26:47.54,00:26:47.54,that you saw on that mask. You must then place the symbols
455,00:26:52.08,00:26:52.08,in the correct order on your team mask.
456,00:26:55.54,00:26:55.54,First team to get it right wins. Want to know what you're
457,00:26:58.75,00:26:58.75,playing for? >> Yeah.
458,00:27:00.08,00:27:00.08,>> PROBST: Winning team wins immunity.
459,00:27:04.04,00:27:04.04,The five people on that team will not go to Tribal Council.
460,00:27:07.04,00:27:07.04,You will be safe from another vote and guaranteed a
461,00:27:09.33,00:27:09.33,one-in-nine shot at a million bucks.

470,00:27:46.50,00:27:46.50,are the symbols in the turtle shell at the top of the mask.
471,00:27:51.50,00:27:51.50,"Whenever you're ready, take off. This challenge has begun."

560,00:32:29.04,00:32:29.04,Let's go. (Orange team cheers)
561,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,>> Whoo! >> See you tonight.
562,00:32:47.42,00:32:47.42,"Take care. >> Dinner, yeah!"
563,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,">> MVP or VIP, both. >> We're going to pop open this"
564,00:32:52.88,00:32:52.88,bottle of wine immediately. >> Yeah.
565,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,>> Is it? Where's the salt?
566,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,>> Whoo! (laughter)
567,00:32:59.83,00:32:59.83,>> It went down like-- it went down like this... whoa!
568,00:33:02.38,00:33:02.38,>> I can feel it going down. >> We're going to be running...
569,00:33:04.79,00:33:04.79,we're going to be streaking naked.
570,00:33:06.21,00:33:06.21,">> I don't want to cook because we have so little, if I mess it"
571,00:33:09.12,00:33:09.12,"up, then I'll get beat up. >> That's what Boo does for a"
572,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,"living, he cooks. >> That challenge saved my butt."
573,00:33:15.54,00:33:15.54,"If we hadn't been divided into teams, I would have been gone."
574,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,"There's no question. You know, I dodged a bullet."
575,00:33:21.33,00:33:21.33,That's good. >> That meat looks glorious.
576,00:33:25.75,00:33:25.75,">> And besides that, we all got steaks and saut\xc3\xa9ed vegetables."
577,00:33:31.04,00:33:31.04,It was nice. It brought my spirits back up.
578,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,">> Man, victory is sweet. >> I didn't want to go to"
579,00:33:42.21,00:33:42.21,"Tribal Council, man. >> I know."
580,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,">> Can't strategize, can't conspire..."
581,00:33:47.62,00:33:47.62,"Straight from the challenge. >> Hey, wink at somebody."
582,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,>> That's going to be hard. >> That's crazy.
583,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,">> It might be something really crazy that happens, that"
584,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33,somebody we didn't even think they would vote off would be
585,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67,gone. >> I'm a little bit worried
586,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,about Alex right now. I hope he doesn't get voted out
587,00:34:01.62,00:34:01.62,"because if he gets voted out, all my plans will be like, all"
588,00:34:04.42,00:34:04.42,the strategies that I worked for the last 24 days will be gone.
589,00:34:07.25,00:34:07.25,"But, uh, Mookie has the idol right now, and maybe, you know,"
590,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,he can use the idol smartly. You know what pisses me off?
591,00:34:13.92,00:34:13.92,The chance that we didn't get to say bye to the person.
592,00:34:16.62,00:34:16.62,">> Yeah, man. >> That sucks that we can't do"
593,00:34:18.42,00:34:18.42,that. >> Who do you think they're
594,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,going to vote out? >> I think it's a toss-up
595,00:34:22.04,00:34:22.04,between Stacy and Michelle. >> I think it will be Stacy.
596,00:34:24.62,00:34:24.62,">> It can be a surprise, though. If Michelle is gone, I'm"
597,00:34:28.12,00:34:28.12,"definitely concerned about the future, 'cause she's a key"
598,00:34:30.21,00:34:30.21,component in my strategy. So I'm really keeping my fingers
599,00:34:33.12,00:34:33.12,"crossed that, uh, she's still alive."
600,00:34:36.42,00:34:36.42,"This is going to be a very, very interesting vote, 'cause you're"
601,00:34:39.12,00:34:39.12,going to get a lot of truth from people.
602,00:35:00.04,00:35:00.04,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
603,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,Rocky and Lisi voted out at the last Tribal Council.
604,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,"Dreamz, tell me about the merge. Was it exciting?"
605,00:35:21.38,00:35:21.38,Was it bad news? What was your reaction?
606,00:35:23.54,00:35:23.54,>> I felt it was like day one all over again except this
607,00:35:26.25,00:35:26.25,time people already know people. So it was all the same to me
608,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,'cause I had friends from the old Moto and friends from the
609,00:35:32.75,00:35:32.75,"new Ravu, so I was pretty, I was pretty happy with that."
610,00:35:36.54,00:35:36.54,">> PROBST: Alex, what was your reaction when you got to the"
611,00:35:38.88,00:35:38.88,beach and found out you were really going back to the
612,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,"original Moto? >> Kind of a ""holy crap."""
613,00:35:44.29,00:35:44.29,"I was shocked. I mean, when I got there, I"
614,00:35:46.62,00:35:46.62,"was, like, ""This is not good. This is not going to be fun."""
615,00:35:51.17,00:35:51.17,">> PROBST: Mookie, can you start to feel paranoia setting"
616,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,in already? >> Definitely feel the paranoia.
617,00:35:56.12,00:35:56.12,"I mean, people are developing different relationships, and"
618,00:35:59.00,00:35:59.00,"you kind of lose yourself in it, and you don't know where"
619,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,you stand anymore. And definitely you feel the
620,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33,"paranoia, especially on the hot seat again."
621,00:36:05.54,00:36:05.54,>> PROBST: Why are you on the hot seat?
622,00:36:07.29,00:36:07.29,>> I think everybody here is on the hot seat.
623,00:36:09.71,00:36:09.71,We weren't able to talk to each other.
624,00:36:11.62,00:36:11.62,"And so now we're here not being able to devise a plan, not being"
625,00:36:15.04,00:36:15.04,"able to talk to each other, understand where our stances are"
626,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,"on who we think should go, and that makes me paranoid."
627,00:36:22.42,00:36:22.42,">> PROBST: Stacy, so here you sit now, getting ready to vote"
628,00:36:25.88,00:36:25.88,somebody out with no idea what everybody else is thinking.
629,00:36:28.88,00:36:28.88,"How uncomfortable are you? >> Um, it's pretty"
630,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,uncomfortable. I think it's a toss-up.
631,00:36:33.58,00:36:33.58,Right now my head is spinning a little bit because there's a
632,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,group here and there's a group there and there's a group to the
633,00:36:38.33,00:36:38.33,"right and the left and behind you, and everybody is thinking"
634,00:36:40.58,00:36:40.58,about different scenarios and different alliances.
635,00:36:44.21,00:36:44.21,">> PROBST: Dreamz, give me a reason to get rid of Stacy."
636,00:36:46.71,00:36:46.71,>> One good reason for me to vote out Stacy is because it
637,00:36:49.71,00:36:49.71,"ain't me. >> PROBST: Michelle, give me a"
638,00:36:55.04,00:36:55.04,good reason to get rid of Dreamz.
639,00:36:57.04,00:36:57.04,">> Me and Dreamz haven't really talked much about strategy, so"
640,00:36:59.62,00:36:59.62,I can't really say who he's in an alliance with.
641,00:37:03.25,00:37:03.25,"It's a fear of the unknown. >> PROBST: Mookie, what's a good"
642,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,reason you should get rid of Michelle?
643,00:37:07.54,00:37:07.54,">> I mean guess one thing about Michelle is, uh, we had a"
644,00:37:10.42,00:37:10.42,"relationship at the old Ravu, and we were good then, but she"
645,00:37:13.96,00:37:13.96,could have switched to a different side.
646,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"That's something I'll have to think about in the next, I don't"
647,00:37:18.79,00:37:18.79,"know how many minutes, you know, and determine who could be the"
648,00:37:21.21,00:37:21.21,"biggest threat, and who can, you know, strengthen my alliance."
649,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,">> PROBST: Michelle, give me a good reason to get rid of Alex."
650,00:37:27.92,00:37:27.92,>> I think the biggest reason to get rid of Alex is that he's
651,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,a threat in challenges. He performs very well every
652,00:37:33.42,00:37:33.42,time. And when it comes down to
653,00:37:35.79,00:37:35.79,"immunity being so important now, it's definitely a threat."
654,00:37:39.29,00:37:39.29,">> PROBST: Alex, give me a reason to get rid of Stacy."
655,00:37:41.71,00:37:41.71,">> I don't really have a good reason to get rid of Stacy,"
656,00:37:44.04,00:37:44.04,Jeff. >> PROBST: Give me a reason to
657,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,get rid of Michelle. >> I don't know Michelle as well
658,00:37:48.29,00:37:48.29,as I know anyone else on this tribe right now.
659,00:37:50.62,00:37:50.62,>> PROBST: Give me a reason to get rid of Mookie.
660,00:37:52.71,00:37:52.71,>> I don't have a reason to get rid of Mookie.
661,00:37:54.79,00:37:54.79,>> PROBST: Give me a reason to get rid of Dreamz.
662,00:37:56.88,00:37:56.88,>> I don't have a reason to get rid of Dreamz.
663,00:37:59.62,00:37:59.62,">> PROBST: Dreamz, do you think as people speak here tonight,"
664,00:38:02.67,00:38:02.67,"that they are speaking not only to me to answer a question, but"
665,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,"also to everybody else here to kind of say ""here's what I'm"
666,00:38:08.17,00:38:08.17,"thinking"" by giving me their answer?"
667,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,>> He just let you know whose name he's putting on the paper.
668,00:38:13.88,00:38:13.88,He don't have to talk to me. He's one of the people I do
669,00:38:16.92,00:38:16.92,trust in the game. So I understand where he's
670,00:38:19.08,00:38:19.08,"coming from. >> PROBST: Mookie, how do you"
671,00:38:21.79,00:38:21.79,"think this will change the game, tonight's vote?"
672,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,>> I think it's going to reveal some things to the other guys
673,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,that are eating steak right now. And they're going to see who's
674,00:38:29.96,00:38:29.96,been telling the truth and who has been lying.
675,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
676,00:38:35.83,00:38:35.83,"If somebody does have the hidden immunity idol, and it turns out"
677,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,"you want to play it tonight, you would present it to me before I"
678,00:38:41.25,00:38:41.25,read the votes. It's time to vote.
679,00:38:43.04,00:38:43.04,"Alex, you're up. >> Sorry, Michelle."
680,00:38:54.62,00:38:54.62,It's nothing personal. I'm just playing the game.
681,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,>> You were on the list of people to go.
682,00:39:36.12,00:39:36.12,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
683,00:39:48.54,00:39:48.54,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want
684,00:39:50.71,00:39:50.71,"to play it, now is the time to do so."
685,00:39:57.21,00:39:57.21,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
686,00:39:59.42,00:39:59.42,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
687,00:40:01.75,00:40:01.75,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
688,00:40:05.83,00:40:05.83,First vote... Stacy.
689,00:40:12.25,00:40:12.25,"Michelle. One vote Stacy, one vote"
690,00:40:14.62,00:40:14.62,Michelle. Stacy.
691,00:40:19.04,00:40:19.04,"Two votes Stacy, one vote Michelle."
692,00:40:25.79,00:40:25.79,Michelle. We're tied.
693,00:40:28.21,00:40:28.21,"Two votes Michelle, two votes Stacy."
694,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,One vote left. Ninth person voted out and the
695,00:40:39.21,00:40:39.21,third member of our jury: Michelle.
696,00:40:43.04,00:40:43.04,"You need to bring me your torch. Michelle, the tribe has spoken."
697,00:40:58.42,00:40:58.42,"Time for you to go. Well, it was clear tonight's"
698,00:41:12.08,00:41:12.08,vote will have a major impact on this game.
699,00:41:15.21,00:41:15.21,And there are five people waiting back at camp eager to
700,00:41:18.04,00:41:18.04,know exactly what that impact will be.
701,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
702,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for
703,00:41:39.83,00:41:39.83,scenes from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
704,00:41:44.50,00:41:44.50,Survivor: Mookie confronts Dreamz about
705,00:41:47.83,00:41:47.83,his vote at Tribal Council... ...and the fireworks begin.
706,00:41:54.62,00:41:54.62,>> I am irritated with Cassandra.
707,00:41:57.25,00:41:57.25,She just made the worst mistake of her life.
708,00:41:59.08,00:41:59.08,>> I'm not going to deceive y'all.
709,00:42:00.58,00:42:00.58,>> PROBST: And Dreamz can't keep quiet.
710,00:42:09.21,00:42:09.21,>> Survivor has been an amazing experience.
711,00:42:11.75,00:42:11.75,I think my alliance is a little weaker now that I'm not there.
712,00:42:16.25,00:42:16.25,Earl is going to have to find himself a new spy.
713,00:42:19.67,00:42:19.67,But I think I've just affirmed I know what kind of person I
714,00:42:23.04,00:42:23.04,"am, and I know what I'm capable of, and that I'm just as strong"
715,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,as I thought.
