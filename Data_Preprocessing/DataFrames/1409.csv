189,00:12:05.46,00:12:05.46,for this.>> When we got on to the Moto
190,00:12:07.88,00:12:07.88,"beach, turned the corner, and loand behold, nothing."
191,00:12:11.88,00:12:11.88,I mean nothing.We got a little bit of fishing
192,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,"gear, a couple of pots, amachete, a flint, and that's it."
193,00:12:21.04,00:12:21.04,>> I've never seen Moto.>> You never did get to see
194,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,"Moto, did you?>> Never got a bed."
195,00:12:26.83,00:12:26.83,I never a toothbrush.I never got anything.
196,00:12:37.42,00:12:37.42,">> Everything was gone.No bed, no couch, no shelter,"
197,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,"no bathroom, no nothing.I felt okay with that."
198,00:12:46.04,00:12:46.04,I kind of laughed.Had a little smirk on my face
199,00:12:48.83,00:12:48.83,because I've already beentrained.
200,00:12:51.42,00:12:51.42,"You know, being at the old Ravufor 13 days-- hey, I'm just back"
201,00:12:56.17,00:12:56.17,home again.>> Everybody has the same way
202,00:12:58.79,00:12:58.79,"now, so.>> Good."
203,00:13:00.42,00:13:00.42,">> All right, well...>> Everybody gather around for"
204,00:13:02.04,00:13:02.04,the mail.All right.
205,00:13:05.04,00:13:05.04,"""Now it is time to reveal yourworld from scratch."
206,00:13:07.88,00:13:07.88,"Give yourself a new name, paintyour new flag, and start the"
207,00:13:11.08,00:13:11.08,"game anew."">> That's it?"
208,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,">> Yeah, that's it.>> Let's do it."
209,00:13:15.79,00:13:15.79,">> All right.>> Okay, what's the name, guys?"
210,00:13:17.46,00:13:17.46,>> Something that has to dowith the islands or something
211,00:13:19.54,00:13:19.54,I don't know.>> Venaca.
212,00:13:21.75,00:13:21.75,">> Isn't Venaca ""thank you""?>> Thank you."
213,00:13:24.12,00:13:24.12,">> And ""Bula"" is hello.>> Let's do Bula."
214,00:13:26.21,00:13:26.21,>> Bula-Bula.>> I... I vote for that.
215,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,>> Bula-Bula.>> Bula-Bula it is.
216,00:13:30.25,00:13:30.25,">> Bula-Bula.>> Either that, either that or"
217,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,the nooky-nooky tribe.>> Bula-nooky.
218,00:13:35.46,00:13:35.46,>> Bula-looky-nooky.>> Hello.
219,00:13:37.46,00:13:37.46,">> So who's good, who's good atdrawing?"
220,00:13:39.75,00:13:39.75,>> Me and Stacy?>> We decided on Bula-Bula as
221,00:13:45.04,00:13:45.04,"the tribe name because ""Bula""is how you say ""hello"" in Fiji."
222,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,>> On the flag itself or onwhat-what's going on here?
223,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,">> The flag.>> No, I wanted to look at our"
224,00:13:58.17,00:13:58.17,canvas.We can never be so sure in this
225,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,"game, you know.>> I know."
226,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,">> We want to be in a safe spot.I think we are now, don't you?"
227,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,">> Yeah, yeah.I'm a little worried because you"
228,00:14:11.04,00:14:11.04,"guys are all still super close.>> Yeah, but the thing is,"
229,00:14:13.50,00:14:13.50,"Michelle, is  that I don't thatthink that we're a threat"
230,00:14:15.83,00:14:15.83,"because we're girls, and thoseguys are going to get super"
231,00:14:18.29,00:14:18.29,"competitive.It's interesting, I think boys"
232,00:14:21.12,00:14:21.12,are going to start attackingboys and getting them off game
233,00:14:23.75,00:14:23.75,"before they're going to touchthe girls, because they look at"
234,00:14:26.25,00:14:26.25,"us as non-threats.So we'll be, like, the last to"
235,00:14:28.83,00:14:28.83,go.I mean that's how it's lined up
236,00:14:31.12,00:14:31.12,for now.We're in a pretty good spot.
237,00:14:34.75,00:14:34.75,>> Now I'm like-- now I'mthinking like the other island
238,00:14:37.00,00:14:37.00,"is better.>> As far as fishing, yeah."
239,00:14:39.04,00:14:39.04,>> Because we could get morefood.
240,00:14:41.08,00:14:41.08,>> Like crabs.We're a new tribe now.
241,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,But there-there's a core group.There's a tribe within the tribe
242,00:14:45.88,00:14:45.88,"and the tribe within the tribeis myself, Michelle, Cassandra,"
243,00:14:50.04,00:14:50.04,and Yau.Now it's just divide and
244,00:14:52.83,00:14:52.83,conquer.We have to kind of divide up
245,00:14:55.12,00:14:55.12,that old Moto and get them oneby one and knock them out.
246,00:14:58.54,00:14:58.54,">> What do you all want to do?>> Yeah, let's divide everything"
247,00:15:02.38,00:15:02.38,up and just get-get going.So the moment has final arrived.
248,00:15:07.17,00:15:07.17,These first couple of hours arereally crucial.
249,00:15:10.58,00:15:10.58,They're going to determine who'sthe final five.
250,00:15:13.25,00:15:13.25,"I'm ready to fight.>> All right, so who's going to"
251,00:15:16.33,00:15:16.33,go fishing?>> I can go.
252,00:15:18.08,00:15:18.08,">> I'll go.>> Let's go us four, then."
253,00:15:20.04,00:15:20.04,>> There are two slings.Two people can be crabbing while
254,00:15:22.12,00:15:22.12,another couple of people can siton the boat and try to fish.
255,00:15:24.75,00:15:24.75,>> I had my niche in the firstMoto tribe.
256,00:15:27.58,00:15:27.58,I had my niche in the secondMoto tribe and I was very
257,00:15:30.17,00:15:30.17,"comfortable.At this point, I'm not"
258,00:15:32.21,00:15:32.21,"comfortable at all, so I'mgoing-going to take a backseat."
259,00:15:35.25,00:15:35.25,"And that's all I can do is be agood little helper, and then"
260,00:15:38.88,00:15:38.88,"when it's time, I'll assumeleadership role again."
261,00:15:46.79,00:15:46.79,>> How was camp over here?>> It was good.
262,00:15:48.62,00:15:48.62,"It was nice.We had a good little, um, thing"
263,00:15:50.88,00:15:50.88,going.>> Me and Dreamz hooked up at
264,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,"Ravu, so we got good.>> I was hoping that."
265,00:15:55.17,00:15:55.17,"I was hoping that.>> Yeah, I mean we clicked and"
266,00:15:57.25,00:15:57.25,"then... he said, you and I saw--I said, you know me and Yau,"
267,00:16:00.08,00:16:00.08,like I trust Yau at Ravu.>> And Earl and Michelle.
268,00:16:02.71,00:16:02.71,">> Am I still one who trustssomeone, Yau?"
269,00:16:05.00,00:16:05.00,>> Yeah.>> Or have I left?
270,00:16:08.04,00:16:08.04,">> No, I didn't go to the darkside."
271,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,">> We were all afraid.>> First second, we got onto"
272,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,"this island, four horsemen aswe discussed-- we were going to"
273,00:16:16.33,00:16:16.33,go split up and figure out whatwas happening at Moto.
274,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,"And so we went straight to work,and infiltrated that group and"
275,00:16:22.58,00:16:22.58,kind of gained their trust.>> Are you guys good with Boo?
276,00:16:26.96,00:16:26.96,"Do you guys like him or...?>> Oh, no."
277,00:16:29.25,00:16:29.25,I'm a...>> He goes first.
278,00:16:30.88,00:16:30.88,>> We can't decide whether it'sBoo or Stacy.
279,00:16:33.04,00:16:33.04,"Stacy because we don't want theAlex connection, but now that"
280,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,we merged...Yeah.
281,00:16:38.25,00:16:38.25,">> And that's the thing, Boojust stirs up too much..."
282,00:16:40.08,00:16:40.08,">> He gets it going quick.>> Yeah, he stirs too much."
283,00:16:42.17,00:16:42.17,"You gotta get him out before hestarts, like..."
284,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,">> Mm-hmm.>> Right away, we found they"
285,00:16:47.25,00:16:47.25,"want Boo out, and then we takeout Stacy."
286,00:16:49.54,00:16:49.54,"Right now, our plan is workingout perfectly as far as what we"
287,00:16:52.12,00:16:52.12,know.We just have to execute it
288,00:16:54.42,00:16:54.42,"right.>> So, Boo first?"
289,00:16:56.42,00:16:56.42,>> Boo first.And then Stacy or Alex.
290,00:17:02.75,00:17:02.75,">> Currently, I'm the only onewith the idol, and Earl is the"
291,00:17:05.17,00:17:05.17,only one who knows I have theidol.
292,00:17:07.71,00:17:07.71,"Potentially, there should be twoimmunity idols in play right now"
293,00:17:11.12,00:17:11.12,in the game.The question is who's got the
294,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,other one?The next opportunity we have we
295,00:17:15.62,00:17:15.62,"would like to vote out Boo, andI think we have pretty much"
296,00:17:19.12,00:17:19.12,"secure Mookie's and Dreamz'svotes, but we don't trust nobody"
297,00:17:23.92,00:17:23.92,"here.>> Oh, it's so cute!"
298,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,">> There you go!>> Yeah, he goes first."
299,00:17:41.12,00:17:41.12,For sure.>> I really have a lot of trust
300,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,"in Alex, because we're bothoriginal Moto, and that's just,"
301,00:17:48.00,00:17:48.00,"you know, the chance that I'mtaking."
302,00:17:50.04,00:17:50.04,But he's the most trustworthyperson that I can think of right
303,00:17:52.62,00:17:52.62,"now.>> I mean, I think we should do"
304,00:17:55.21,00:17:55.21,"what's most convenient for us.You know, me, you, and Ed are"
305,00:17:57.67,00:17:57.67,tighter-- are going to betighter together than whoever
306,00:18:00.17,00:18:00.17,it is that's around.>> And then we-we also are more
307,00:18:04.38,00:18:04.38,"solid, too, on a vote.>> Yeah, we're more solid..."
308,00:18:06.71,00:18:06.71,>> Against two.>> I can use the relationships
309,00:18:10.25,00:18:10.25,"I've had to sort of create smokeand mirrors, to keep them sort"
310,00:18:13.79,00:18:13.79,"of guessing, so that, you know,the four horsemen can take it"
311,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,"all the way.Unless I'm mistaken, the four of"
312,00:18:18.54,00:18:18.54,us are controlling this gameright now.
313,00:18:20.58,00:18:20.58,"I could be wrong, and I couldbe getting set up, but this is"
314,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,my best bet.What can I do?
315,00:18:25.42,00:18:25.42,I know you're smart.I'm not worried about you.
316,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,I just wanted you have all theinformation I have.
317,00:18:30.04,00:18:30.04,">> No, I appreciate it.>> We all want Boo off."
318,00:18:40.21,00:18:40.21,">> Yeah, so Boo's going to gooff first."
319,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,>> And then we're going to getStacy off second.
320,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,>> The thing is-- yeah...>> Okay.
321,00:18:53.08,00:18:53.08,">> All of a sudden, Mookie letDreamz know that we had the"
322,00:18:57.38,00:18:57.38,"idol, and as soon as thathappened, my gut was like, ""Ooh,"
323,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"that was not so smart.""But you can't say a ... word."
324,00:19:04.25,00:19:04.25,>> You can't say...>> Do I look like...? Shut up.
325,00:19:06.62,00:19:06.62," >> No, no, no, no, just...>> I'm not... no, I'm not..."
326,00:19:08.71,00:19:08.71,">> Don't tell, don't tellCassandra."
327,00:19:10.71,00:19:10.71,">> When Alex and Mookie told methat they had the immunity idol,"
328,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,I was kind of mad because theydidn't tell me when they first
329,00:19:15.25,00:19:15.25,found it.>> Just a few days ago.
330,00:19:17.33,00:19:17.33,>> Why didn't y'all tell me?>> 'Cause we didn't...
331,00:19:19.67,00:19:19.67,">> Only because of Cassandra,just to make sure."
332,00:19:22.08,00:19:22.08,"But we were going to tell you.>> We had a pact, and they kind"
333,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,of made me not trust them alittle bit and-and made me feel
334,00:19:28.29,00:19:28.29,"that I was on the outskirts.So, point-blank, I'm going to"
335,00:19:31.00,00:19:31.00,trust them until I can't trustthem no more.
336,00:19:33.04,00:19:33.04,"Strange.No, I wouldn't have said"
337,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,anything.I'm glad you all told me now
338,00:19:37.25,00:19:37.25,because I was getting kind ofscared.
339,00:19:39.17,00:19:39.17,I-I was getting kind of scaredabout...
340,00:19:41.04,00:19:41.04,>> ...now it works perfect.>> Now is everything's perfect.
341,00:19:44.08,00:19:44.08,"Let's do it, y'all.Don't screw up."
342,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,No more talk.>> Dreamz knows about the
343,00:19:55.88,00:19:55.88,"immunity idol, by the way.>> Who told him?"
344,00:19:58.75,00:19:58.75,>> Mookie wanted to tell him.>> You told Dreamz about the
345,00:20:01.17,00:20:01.17,"idol, man?>> Why?"
346,00:20:03.58,00:20:03.58,">> All right, I'm going to tellyou right now, I don't like that"
347,00:20:06.17,00:20:06.17,plan.Like not-not that I don't trust
348,00:20:08.04,00:20:08.04,"you, but trusting all thesepeople..."
349,00:20:09.58,00:20:09.58,">> No, no, either way, we'retaking out Boo first."
350,00:20:11.62,00:20:11.62,That's-that's everyone'sconsensus.
351,00:20:13.62,00:20:13.62,>> I'm pissed off about thewhole situation right now.
352,00:20:15.67,00:20:15.67,"We found the immunity idol.It's something that, you know,"
353,00:20:18.12,00:20:18.12,you need to keep between threeor two people to make it work.
354,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,"That's all the people thatneeded to be told, and Mookie"
355,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,just told Dreamz out of nowhere.And now I feel really
356,00:20:27.12,00:20:27.12,uncomfortable because Dreamzhas the... knows about the idol;
357,00:20:29.79,00:20:29.79,Cassandra knows about the idol;Earl knows about the idol.
358,00:20:34.04,00:20:34.04,">> Do you get what I'm saying?>> Maybe-- I mean, I don't know"
359,00:20:37.12,00:20:37.12,"how you feel about this, but weshould maybe just take Boo out"
360,00:20:39.54,00:20:39.54,"first, and then at that pointStacy has nowhere to go."
361,00:20:42.12,00:20:42.12,"And I trust Stacy.She's not gonna, she's not"
362,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,gonna...So we could pull her in.
363,00:20:48.21,00:20:48.21,That's five.That's a five-four majority.
364,00:20:51.88,00:20:51.88,"That's the simplest way.Stacy will be loyal, and we"
365,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,don't really have to worryabout her winning the final
366,00:20:58.96,00:20:58.96,"immunity, I don't think.And we can put whatever order"
367,00:21:02.42,00:21:02.42,you want.I don't care.
368,00:21:06.88,00:21:06.88,">> I mean, that's fine.The original plan was to"

583,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33,somebody we didn't even thinkthey would vote off would be
584,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67,gone.>> I'm a little bit worried
585,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,about Alex right now.I hope he doesn't get voted out
586,00:34:01.62,00:34:01.62,"because if he gets voted out,all my plans will be like, all"
587,00:34:04.42,00:34:04.42,the strategies that I worked forthe last 24 days will be gone.
588,00:34:07.25,00:34:07.25,"But, uh, Mookie has the idolright now, and maybe, you know,"
589,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,he can use the idol smartly.You know what pisses me off?
590,00:34:13.92,00:34:13.92,The chance that we didn't get tosay bye to the person.

594,00:34:22.04,00:34:22.04,between Stacy and Michelle.>> I think it will be Stacy.
595,00:34:24.62,00:34:24.62,">> It can be a surprise, though.If Michelle is gone, I'm"
596,00:34:28.12,00:34:28.12,"definitely concerned about thefuture, 'cause she's a key"
597,00:34:30.21,00:34:30.21,component in my strategy.So I'm really keeping my fingers
598,00:34:33.12,00:34:33.12,"crossed that, uh, she's stillalive."
599,00:34:36.42,00:34:36.42,"This is going to be a very, veryinteresting vote, 'cause you're"

605,00:35:23.54,00:35:23.54,>> I felt it was like day oneall over again except this
606,00:35:26.25,00:35:26.25,time people already know people.So it was all the same to me
607,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,'cause I had friends from theold Moto and friends from the
608,00:35:32.75,00:35:32.75,"new Ravu, so I was pretty, I waspretty happy with that."

618,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,you stand anymore.And definitely you feel the
619,00:36:03.33,00:36:03.33,"paranoia, especially on thehot seat again."
620,00:36:05.54,00:36:05.54,>> PROBST: Why are you on thehot seat?
621,00:36:07.29,00:36:07.29,>> I think everybody here is onthe hot seat.
622,00:36:09.71,00:36:09.71,We weren't able to talk to eachother.
623,00:36:11.62,00:36:11.62,"And so now we're here not beingable to devise a plan, not being"

625,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,"on who we think should go,and that makes me paranoid."

629,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,uncomfortable.I think it's a toss-up.
630,00:36:33.58,00:36:33.58,Right now my head is spinninga little bit because there's a
631,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,group here and there's a groupthere and there's a group to the
632,00:36:38.33,00:36:38.33,"right and the left and behindyou, and everybody is thinking"

642,00:37:07.54,00:37:07.54,">> I mean guess one thing aboutMichelle is, uh, we had a"
643,00:37:10.42,00:37:10.42,"relationship at the old Ravu,and we were good then, but she"
644,00:37:13.96,00:37:13.96,could have switched to adifferent side.

649,00:37:27.92,00:37:27.92,>> I think the biggest reasonto get rid of Alex is that he's
650,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,a threat in challenges.He performs very well every
651,00:37:33.42,00:37:33.42,time.And when it comes down to
652,00:37:35.79,00:37:35.79,"immunity being so importantnow, it's definitely a threat."
