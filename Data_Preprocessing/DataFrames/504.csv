1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.10,00:00:01.10,JEFF PROBST:   Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.87,00:00:02.87, The tribes went head to head
4,00:00:04.40,00:00:04.40, in one of the most physical  challenges yet...
5,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37, and Chuay Gahn finally  ended their losing streak.
6,00:00:09.90,00:00:09.90,-Yeah! -(cheering)
7,00:00:11.50,00:00:11.50," At Sook Jai, Robb was  bitter about the loss."
8,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,"He's a weak, little, whiny punk. Did you hear him..."
9,00:00:16.97,00:00:16.97,"(speaking gibberish) ...screaming at me, dude?"
10,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,I wanted to spit in his face.
11,00:00:20.73,00:00:20.73,PROBST: Chuay Gahn got two  Red Beret survival experts
12,00:00:22.90,00:00:22.90, for 24 hours as their reward.
13,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60, But their happy family  had a crisis
14,00:00:27.37,00:00:27.37, when Ted and Ghandia got a  little too close for comfort.
15,00:00:30.70,00:00:30.70,Specifically he was grinding against-- against me.
16,00:00:33.90,00:00:33.90,PROBST: At first Ghandia  accepted Ted's apology.
17,00:00:36.67,00:00:36.67,"Sometimes when I'm sleeping in the middle of the night,"
18,00:00:39.20,00:00:39.20,"I'm not, like, totally clear."
19,00:00:40.47,00:00:40.47,I'm thinking I'm sleeping with my wife.
20,00:00:41.93,00:00:41.93,PROBST:   But the issue didn't die.
21,00:00:43.87,00:00:43.87,"He started biting me on my shoulder back here,"
22,00:00:46.03,00:00:46.03,"-like sexy biting, you know, like... -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
23,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00,PROBST:  Ghandia's emotions boiled over.
24,00:00:50.23,00:00:50.23,(screaming)
25,00:00:52.87,00:00:52.87, Ted called a meeting to get  things out in the open.
26,00:00:55.70,00:00:55.70,"And the excuse that you gave me,"
27,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,I thought that that was disingenuous.
28,00:00:58.77,00:00:58.77,"TED: That's funny, because your comment after I apologized"
29,00:01:01.37,00:01:01.37,"was to cry and say, ""You know, I really, really needed that,"
30,00:01:03.80,00:01:03.80,"-and I really appreciate your honesty."" -I did, I did."
31,00:01:05.70,00:01:05.70,"PROBST:  Despite all their problems,"
32,00:01:07.93,00:01:07.93, Chuay Gahn finally won  immunity...
33,00:01:09.80,00:01:09.80,"Chuay Gahn, get a little feel of this for a change."
34,00:01:12.00,00:01:12.00,(cheering)
35,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00, ...sending Sook Jai to their  first Tribal Council.
36,00:01:16.20,00:01:16.20," And although Shii Ann received  three votes,"
37,00:01:18.00,00:01:18.00,Jed was voted out of the tribe.
38,00:01:19.70,00:01:19.70,"Jed, the tribe has spoken."
39,00:01:22.80,00:01:22.80, 13 are left.
40,00:01:24.20,00:01:24.20, Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:36.17,00:02:36.17,(thunder rumbling)
42,00:02:45.03,00:02:45.03,ROBB: Are you guys happy with your decision?
43,00:02:46.77,00:02:46.77,JAKE: I wasn't happy with being there.
44,00:02:48.77,00:02:48.77,I'm not happy with getting home this late.
45,00:02:51.07,00:02:51.07,SHII ANN: Didn't feel good to have my name read out loud.
46,00:02:54.57,00:02:54.57,"It was not unexpected, you guys, but still it was like..."
47,00:02:58.73,00:02:58.73,"Yeah, I figured I'd at least have"
48,00:03:00.10,00:03:00.10,one person calling my name out.
49,00:03:01.33,00:03:01.33," We had Tribal Council,  and, uh..."
50,00:03:03.03,00:03:03.03,"I was pretty shocked with the outcome,"
51,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,to be completely honest.
52,00:03:07.00,00:03:07.00, I originally thought  that Shii Ann
53,00:03:08.33,00:03:08.33," was going to be  the one voted off,"
54,00:03:10.03,00:03:10.03,"but um, it just goes to show you, man,"
55,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,nothing's set in stone out here.
56,00:03:14.27,00:03:14.27,PENNY: I do not want to go through again what we went
57,00:03:16.70,00:03:16.70,"-through tonight. -JAKE: I don't, either. I don't ever want"
58,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,-to go through that again. -SHII ANN: Me either.
59,00:03:19.90,00:03:19.90,And I want to literally kick ass in the next reward and immunity
60,00:03:23.90,00:03:23.90,to show them we're not quitters.
61,00:03:25.67,00:03:25.67,PENNY:  I voted for Jed
62,00:03:27.57,00:03:27.57,'cause that's what the majority  wanted to do.
63,00:03:29.73,00:03:29.73,Jed was trying to run the show around here and be the leader
64,00:03:32.53,00:03:32.53, and wouldn't take  anyone else's advice
65,00:03:34.27,00:03:34.27, if it wasn't his way.
66,00:03:36.40,00:03:36.40,And I think we made a good choice.
67,00:03:38.00,00:03:38.00,(thunder crashing)
68,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,(rain falling)
69,00:04:12.30,00:04:12.30,Good morning.
70,00:04:14.73,00:04:14.73,STEPHANIE: They got rid of Jed.  Piss on 'em.
71,00:04:18.57,00:04:18.57,"I really couldn't believe it. I mean, I was shocked."
72,00:04:20.80,00:04:20.80," As hard as this is right now,"
73,00:04:22.57,00:04:22.57, I don't think you get rid of the people who are helping you.
74,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80, SHII ANN: We were going to  go out and look for food
75,00:04:40.53,00:04:40.53," when the tide got  a little bit lower,"
76,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33, but there was a bunch  of squid on the beach.
77,00:04:45.17,00:04:45.17,"And, um, Stephanie found it."
78,00:04:52.20,00:04:52.20,"STEPHANIE: You know, I don't  understand them at all,"
79,00:04:54.10,00:04:54.10,with food right in front of their face
80,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97,and-and whining about being hungry.
81,00:04:57.33,00:04:57.33, That just disgusts me.
82,00:04:59.57,00:04:59.57,Don't burn your little tootsies off.
83,00:05:01.73,00:05:01.73,"You guys, let's not use a big pot to ever cook any seafood."
84,00:05:05.60,00:05:05.60,Let's keep the big pot just for water.
85,00:05:07.87,00:05:07.87,-I got more squid. -JAKE: You found two more?
86,00:05:10.07,00:05:10.07,You guys must not even be looking.
87,00:05:12.37,00:05:12.37,They're laying right here in front of you.
88,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10,"JAKE: Well, actually, we've been tending the fire."
89,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,STEPHANIE: All of you?
90,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,"-All five of you? -No, no."
91,00:05:18.53,00:05:18.53,Stick it where you want it.
92,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90,SHII ANN: I don't know what  Stephanie's problem is.
93,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17," Honestly,  I think she just feels"
94,00:05:27.57,00:05:27.57," like she's doing  all of the work,"
95,00:05:29.33,00:05:29.33,which is totally not true.
96,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67," And I think she just feels  like we're all idiots,"
97,00:05:34.63,00:05:34.63,"which again, is not true."
98,00:05:35.97,00:05:35.97,She just hates us. I don't know why.
99,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70,JAKE: I don't know what the deal is.
100,00:05:39.27,00:05:39.27,She hasn't wanted to be a part of our group since we started.
101,00:05:42.53,00:05:42.53,Squid laying out here and all five of them are over there
102,00:05:45.67,00:05:45.67,working on the fire or whatever the hell they're doing.
103,00:05:47.93,00:05:47.93,The tide could come up and wash them away.
104,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,"It's kind of like the screwing in the light bulb joke,"
105,00:05:51.73,00:05:51.73,"you know, I mean, how many does it take to build a damn fire?"
106,00:05:56.80,00:05:56.80,ROBB: This whole piece is about done right here.
107,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,-PENNY: It'll be nice to eat this morning. -Mm.
108,00:06:04.13,00:06:04.13,"ERIN:  Stephanie, with her attitude,"
109,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30, nobody wants that around.
110,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,"You know, we have enough of other elements going against us:"
111,00:06:11.43,00:06:11.43,"the rain, the wind, you know,"
112,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83, not having any food.
113,00:06:14.90,00:06:14.90, And then to have someone  be grumpy like that...
114,00:06:17.50,00:06:17.50," If I was in her position,  I would just suck it up"
115,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97," and try to, you know, fit in  as well as I could"
116,00:06:22.30,00:06:22.30,so that I could stay on the island.
117,00:06:42.43,00:06:42.43,JAN:  People are getting tired.
118,00:06:44.00,00:06:44.00, There are some people on edge
119,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97, since the incident  with Ted and Ghandia.
120,00:06:48.90,00:06:48.90,The mood's a little bit mellow.
121,00:06:52.20,00:06:52.20," It's kind of, um... unspoken."
122,00:06:54.77,00:06:54.77, No one's going  to mention it again
123,00:06:56.43,00:06:56.43, because they had their talk.
124,00:06:57.63,00:06:57.63," Everybody was there,"
125,00:06:58.90,00:06:58.90," so each person has  to process both sides,"
126,00:07:02.03,00:07:02.03, and then they have  to handle it themselves.
127,00:07:03.70,00:07:03.70, But the mood is different.  Um...
128,00:07:06.70,00:07:06.70,It's not as jovial as it used to be.
129,00:07:26.10,00:07:26.10,GHANDIA: I think it's stupid  the way Ted's acting.
130,00:07:28.87,00:07:28.87,"It's absolutely asinine, and if Ted really wanted to let it go,"
131,00:07:32.90,00:07:32.90, then he would let it go  and then it would be cool.
132,00:07:35.23,00:07:35.23, But Ted is set in the  atmosphere that if Ghandia
133,00:07:37.27,00:07:37.27," comes around, don't say nothing, don't laugh, you know?"
134,00:07:39.63,00:07:39.63," It's just... it's really,  it's really crappy."
135,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60, I can't make him talk to me.  That's his choice.
136,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,"That's how he's dealing with his anger, not talking to me,"
137,00:07:46.80,00:07:46.80," not looking at me, trying  to ignore me completely,"
138,00:07:49.47,00:07:49.47, like I'm not even here.
139,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80," So as a result of that, people  who he's hanging around with"
140,00:07:53.63,00:07:53.63, adopt that same behavior.
141,00:07:55.07,00:07:55.07, It's a really bad feeling.
142,00:07:57.13,00:07:57.13," I feel like as a body,"
143,00:07:58.80,00:07:58.80," if Chuay Gahn was a body,  then I'm the arm"
144,00:08:01.47,00:08:01.47,that got bit off by a shark and now it's not there no more.
145,00:08:07.13,00:08:07.13,"How is it, Mama?"
146,00:08:08.67,00:08:08.67,Oh... spicy.
147,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,I like it.
148,00:08:11.93,00:08:11.93,"TED: The relationship  between Ghandia and I,"
149,00:08:14.80,00:08:14.80,"I don't talk to her, I don't look at her."
150,00:08:17.30,00:08:17.30,I don't do anything with her.
151,00:08:18.80,00:08:18.80," Initially, I thought  she was a very nice person."
152,00:08:21.37,00:08:21.37," However, when, um, she tried  to exploit my family"
153,00:08:24.13,00:08:24.13," and really tried to damage my  name, my character, etc.,"
154,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40," um, it was a totally different"
155,00:08:29.83,00:08:29.83,outlook that I had for her.
156,00:08:31.97,00:08:31.97,"And so as far as I'm considering,"
157,00:08:33.93,00:08:33.93, she's nonexistent.
158,00:08:34.93,00:08:34.93," I only see five people  on this island,"
159,00:08:37.63,00:08:37.63," and I hope I never, ever, ever  see her again in my life."
160,00:08:40.73,00:08:40.73,I-I really can't stand her.
161,00:08:42.43,00:08:42.43,"If I would've cuddled up with one of you guys,"
162,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,I would have probably done the same thing...
163,00:08:47.03,00:08:47.03,I'm-a tell you what. I wouldn't have waited till morning.
164,00:08:48.43,00:08:48.43,"I'd have said, ""Ted, get your ... away from me right now."""
165,00:08:51.07,00:08:51.07,Right.
166,00:08:52.07,00:08:52.07,"When I first saw Ghandia, I didn't like her."
167,00:08:53.97,00:08:53.97,"I mean, when I first saw her, I said, ""This is a problem woman."""
168,00:08:56.97,00:08:56.97, I was hoping she wasn't  going to be on my tribe.
169,00:08:59.20,00:08:59.20, I saw a lot of trouble  with Ghandia.
170,00:09:01.37,00:09:01.37,"When I first saw her, that's just the way I had her pegged."
171,00:09:04.00,00:09:04.00,"Then after we got out here, I thought maybe I was wrong."
172,00:09:05.97,00:09:05.97,Maybe I was a little bit wrong.
173,00:09:08.17,00:09:08.17,"But nutty buddy, did the blood come to the forefront."
174,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67,-Uh-huh. -Wow.
175,00:09:11.20,00:09:11.20,"Do I feel sorry for Ghandia? Hell, no."
176,00:09:13.83,00:09:13.83,I'm ready to get her ass back in Denver as quick as I can.
177,00:09:16.97,00:09:16.97,"If they can get a fast jet here,"
178,00:09:18.53,00:09:18.53,she needs to get on and get the hell out of here for my sake.
179,00:09:21.10,00:09:21.10,GHANDIA: So much love in the cave.
180,00:09:25.33,00:09:25.33,You can just feel all the love
181,00:09:27.20,00:09:27.20,just oozing out of the pores of the cave.
182,00:09:29.50,00:09:29.50,"Love, love,"
183,00:09:31.10,00:09:31.10,"love, love, everywhere."
184,00:09:33.80,00:09:33.80,"These six self-sacrificing people,"
185,00:09:37.13,00:09:37.13,commune together in this cave.
186,00:09:39.80,00:09:39.80,It's just a big love fest.
187,00:09:41.70,00:09:41.70,"Even when people don't talk to you,"
188,00:09:43.40,00:09:43.40,they show you that they love you
189,00:09:45.00,00:09:45.00,because they're trying to teach you a lesson.
190,00:09:50.97,00:09:50.97,"And that's love, too, you know?"
191,00:09:59.67,00:09:59.67,This is so beautiful here.
192,00:10:01.97,00:10:01.97,It sure feels good.
193,00:10:03.50,00:10:03.50,I still didn't see too many fish.
194,00:10:05.17,00:10:05.17,I saw a couple of fish jumping out of the water.
195,00:10:07.40,00:10:07.40,-Yeah. -All right.
196,00:10:08.50,00:10:08.50,-Fishing is tough out here. -It is.

398,00:20:13.13,00:20:13.13,"PROBST: Chuay Gahn, you guys can head back to camp."
399,00:20:16.90,00:20:16.90,"Sook Jai, take your bananas and get on out of here."
400,00:20:41.23,00:20:41.23,"Yep, that was a rough one."
401,00:20:43.53,00:20:43.53,(grunts)
402,00:20:44.63,00:20:44.63,(indistinct talking in background)
403,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,"CLAY: As far as the other tribe goes, they beat us pretty good,"
404,00:20:50.03,00:20:50.03, and I know Ghandia and Jan--
405,00:20:52.30,00:20:52.30," uh, they got about halfway  through the course"
406,00:20:54.30,00:20:54.30,"and they, they were finished."
407,00:20:55.97,00:20:55.97,"TED: All I know is we were pushing and pulling,"
408,00:20:58.03,00:20:58.03,"pushing and pulling, and..."
409,00:20:59.03,00:20:59.03,(Clay mumbles)
410,00:21:00.03,00:21:00.03,...homegirl got heavier
411,00:21:01.77,00:21:01.77,"and heavier and heavier. I was like,"
412,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,"-""Come on, Chuay Girl."" -BRIAN: She was heavy."
413,00:21:05.50,00:21:05.50,CLAY: Ted and Brian  both kind of made mention
414,00:21:07.03,00:21:07.03," that we looked down  two or three times,"
415,00:21:09.10,00:21:09.10, and Ghandia was pulling and  pushing backwards on the dummy
416,00:21:12.10,00:21:12.10, to get herself up the hill.
417,00:21:14.93,00:21:14.93,"That's the reason I changed positions,"
418,00:21:16.37,00:21:16.37,"'cause the way it was going, it wasn't going to work."
419,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,We didn't have a chance in hell.
420,00:21:22.43,00:21:22.43,Ghandia didn't have on the right shoes.
421,00:21:24.07,00:21:24.07,"I saw her one left foot,"
422,00:21:25.47,00:21:25.47,"her left shoe came off, so she was"
423,00:21:27.70,00:21:27.70,just kind of holding on to the back.
424,00:21:29.00,00:21:29.00,TED: Okay.
425,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,"And then, uh, Granny-- I mean, how much use is she?"
426,00:21:33.27,00:21:33.27,Yeah.
427,00:21:35.77,00:21:35.77,"GHANDIA: And the boys go off to play the blame game,"
428,00:21:37.97,00:21:37.97,"and the gals go off to get food,"
429,00:21:41.03,00:21:41.03,and you'd better believe they're playing the blame game
430,00:21:42.80,00:21:42.80,right now because the two punk asses was already doing it
431,00:21:45.63,00:21:45.63,when they were sitting on the log.
432,00:21:47.07,00:21:47.07,"-Oh, they were? -Yeah."
433,00:21:48.53,00:21:48.53,"Clay-- ""Don't you think when they threw that doll over there,"
434,00:21:52.07,00:21:52.07,"it went all the way down, don't you think?"""
435,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,"You know, that's how Clay do, man."
436,00:21:56.07,00:21:56.07," I think maybe from Ted  and Clay's perspective,"
437,00:21:58.07,00:21:58.07, I think they're just trying  to blame other people.
438,00:22:00.30,00:22:00.30,"You know, somebody didn't carry  their weight, you know."
439,00:22:02.33,00:22:02.33,"""Janny was not strong enough, Ghandia lost her sandal."""
440,00:22:05.77,00:22:05.77,"You know, that's kind of how they do."
441,00:22:07.27,00:22:07.27,They like to finger-point and do that kind of bull.
442,00:22:10.90,00:22:10.90,"I'll even say it, too. I ain't no hardbody."
443,00:22:12.97,00:22:12.97,"Yeah, I kickbox, yeah, I work out,"
444,00:22:14.70,00:22:14.70,"yeah, I have two kids, yeah, I run around all the time,"
445,00:22:17.03,00:22:17.03,but I don't work out seven days a week.
446,00:22:18.90,00:22:18.90,Everybody on there is physically fit.
447,00:22:20.10,00:22:20.10,"-I know, they are... -And here's the thing."
448,00:22:21.77,00:22:21.77,I didn't come on this game to win no frigging bananas.
449,00:22:23.80,00:22:23.80,"I came on this game to win some frigging money, okay?"
450,00:22:26.30,00:22:26.30,"So Moo Cow and, you know, Fat Albert over there"
451,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87,"that's missing food every day, this game is a test of your will"
452,00:22:31.73,00:22:31.73,and your strength and how strong you are to survive.
453,00:22:33.80,00:22:33.80,-That's right. -So that's the way you got to think about it.
454,00:22:35.93,00:22:35.93,"We ain't gonna be picking each other apart,"
455,00:22:37.60,00:22:37.60,"and if they start that ..., I'm gonna shut that ... down."
456,00:22:39.70,00:22:39.70,I don't care.
457,00:22:40.70,00:22:40.70,It'll be Ghandia's turn to go.
458,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,I ain't gonna play all that blame game ...
459,00:22:47.20,00:22:47.20,"SHII ANN: You guys, this is awesome."
460,00:22:50.30,00:22:50.30,-My gosh. -I have never eaten so many bananas at one time.
461,00:22:52.70,00:22:52.70,"ROBB: I even like the mushy ones, and I never like"
462,00:22:54.73,00:22:54.73,-mushy bananas.  -The banana--
463,00:22:56.30,00:22:56.30, it was sweet and it was soft  and it was warm and...
464,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,-so good.  -This is the best day
465,00:23:00.23,00:23:00.23,"-since I've been here. -Yeah, I agree."
466,00:23:01.87,00:23:01.87,"ROBB: Thank you, God, for a triumphant day."
467,00:23:04.50,00:23:04.50,You rewarded us with the nourishment all of us needed.
468,00:23:05.77,00:23:05.77,"-For this I give much thanks to you, Almighty Lord, amen. -Amen."
469,00:23:09.37,00:23:09.37,STEPHANIE: I think everybody's  feeling really elated
470,00:23:11.63,00:23:11.63," right now.  I mean, my energy level"
471,00:23:12.67,00:23:12.67,"went from, like-- a ten being the top,"
472,00:23:16.57,00:23:16.57,"I was about at a two, you know,  and I'm pushing six now, so,"
473,00:23:20.07,00:23:20.07,"yeah, I feel pretty good."
474,00:23:21.37,00:23:21.37,-(clucks) -SHII ANN: What is that? -Something alive.
475,00:23:23.70,00:23:23.70,-Something. -Chickens.
476,00:23:25.27,00:23:25.27,"STEPHANIE: When we got back  to camp from our challenge,"
477,00:23:26.93,00:23:26.93," we found four chickens, and--"
478,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83,"to feed four of 'em, so we're going to see"
479,00:23:30.27,00:23:30.27," if they'll lay some eggs  for us, and if they don't,"
480,00:23:32.23,00:23:32.23, then we'll just pull  their heads off
481,00:23:33.60,00:23:33.60,and eat 'em at some point in time.
482,00:23:35.10,00:23:35.10,"We got chickens, dude."
483,00:23:36.13,00:23:36.13,-I've never had a chicken before. -You haven't?
484,00:23:38.17,00:23:38.17,"Oh, thank God, we'll have something other"
485,00:23:39.57,00:23:39.57,than squid to eat.
486,00:23:40.93,00:23:40.93,JAKE: You guys gonna lay some eggs for us?
487,00:23:42.50,00:23:42.50,ROBB: We have a continuous source of food right here.
488,00:23:44.07,00:23:44.07, All of us were
489,00:23:45.37,00:23:45.37, super excited to see  that we had chickens.
490,00:23:46.37,00:23:46.37, It's like a food source
491,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87,that'll never go bad.
492,00:23:48.97,00:23:48.97,(Robb clucking)
493,00:23:50.03,00:23:50.03,"Look at that one, dude."
494,00:23:51.83,00:23:51.83,(Robb clucking)
495,00:23:55.37,00:23:55.37,You better not get any ideas to start cock-a-doodle-doo-ing
496,00:23:58.20,00:23:58.20,at 3:00 in the morning.
497,00:23:59.20,00:23:59.20,You're gonna get a broken neck.
498,00:24:00.53,00:24:00.53,We're gonna check
499,00:24:01.80,00:24:01.80,"for eggs every day, and I expect there to be eggs,"
500,00:24:05.00,00:24:05.00,or somebody's getting hacked.
501,00:24:07.97,00:24:07.97,Look at me when I'm talking to you.
502,00:24:10.00,00:24:10.00,(laughs)
503,00:24:11.30,00:24:11.30," I feel amazing, nourished,  happy, thankful,"
504,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17, about every good emotion  you can imagine feeling.
505,00:24:17.90,00:24:17.90,"Things aren't so bad out here, man."
506,00:24:19.57,00:24:19.57,"CLAY: Take the weight off of you, and here we gonna go."
507,00:24:22.23,00:24:22.23,"Ooh, did y'all see that fish right there?"
508,00:24:24.03,00:24:24.03,Uh-uh.
509,00:24:25.27,00:24:25.27,"-The fish is teasing us, huh? -BRIAN: Yeah."
510,00:24:27.50,00:24:27.50,Eventually we'll catch something with that net.
511,00:24:32.07,00:24:32.07,You know?
512,00:24:33.43,00:24:33.43,Once the fish get brave enough to come in.
513,00:24:37.70,00:24:37.70,"We still haven't seen too many fish come in, but that's okay."
514,00:24:40.10,00:24:40.10,CLAY: That's the first fish I've seen jump out
515,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,in front of our camp.
516,00:24:44.77,00:24:44.77,(yawns)
517,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,Hopefully the guys are down looking for clams.
518,00:24:51.00,00:24:51.00,"I told Clay, you know, ""You can turn over rocks"
519,00:24:53.27,00:24:53.27,"and find clams,"" so I'm hoping that's what they're doing."
520,00:24:55.70,00:24:55.70,I don't know what they're doing right now.
521,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,I haven't checked on them.
522,00:24:58.93,00:24:58.93,It's not... I'm not on boy watch today.
523,00:25:01.00,00:25:01.00,(laughter)
524,00:25:02.80,00:25:02.80,"Oh, boy."
525,00:25:07.10,00:25:07.10,"Lordy, Lordy."
526,00:25:09.40,00:25:09.40,JAN:  I'm starting to feel
527,00:25:11.20,00:25:11.20, that there's tension  with the workload.
528,00:25:13.33,00:25:13.33, The men aren't
529,00:25:15.57,00:25:15.57,"pulling their weight or offering,"
530,00:25:17.87,00:25:17.87,"""Can I help do something?"""
531,00:25:19.47,00:25:19.47," It appears to me  that the men are,"
532,00:25:22.20,00:25:22.20, are kind of monitoring  like the Thai men.
533,00:25:24.77,00:25:24.77,"They go out and fish, they come  back, their day's over."
534,00:25:27.93,00:25:27.93,"Well, then the women have to clean the house,"
535,00:25:29.90,00:25:29.90," make sure it's all tidy, do the breakfast, do the lunch,"
536,00:25:33.67,00:25:33.67," clean up, do the dishes,  come... you know,"
537,00:25:36.07,00:25:36.07," so after a while,"
538,00:25:37.53,00:25:37.53," especially when everybody's  supposed to be working,"
539,00:25:39.67,00:25:39.67,that would get on your nerves.
540,00:25:41.13,00:25:41.13,Seems like the only people that know how to multitask
541,00:25:43.20,00:25:43.20,around here are sitting up here.
542,00:25:44.70,00:25:44.70,(laughter)
543,00:25:47.00,00:25:47.00,That's all I'm gonna say about that.
544,00:25:48.57,00:25:48.57,I ain't gonna be quiet about that too much longer.
545,00:25:51.90,00:25:51.90,I'm getting tired of us doing all the work preparing the food.
546,00:25:53.73,00:25:53.73,Look what they're doing-- swimming?
547,00:25:55.83,00:25:55.83,"I have a husband at home, okay?"
548,00:25:57.63,00:25:57.63,I didn't come here to acquire three more.
549,00:26:00.47,00:26:00.47,JAN: I'm putting an order in for a bigger butt next life.
550,00:26:03.47,00:26:03.47,"BRIAN: Well, I think that's just the natural transition in life."
551,00:26:06.93,00:26:06.93,"Um, ladies in the kitchen and the men take care of business"
552,00:26:09.23,00:26:09.23,"and do all the fishing, um..."
553,00:26:10.87,00:26:10.87, That resorts back to thousands  and thousands of years.
554,00:26:13.17,00:26:13.17," Like, it's right here,"
555,00:26:14.83,00:26:14.83," we're in the jungle, we're  back in the good old days,"
556,00:26:17.10,00:26:17.10," and, uh, it's just they naturally went to their duties,"
557,00:26:19.83,00:26:19.83," which is cooking and cleaning,"
558,00:26:22.00,00:26:22.00,"and actually I got some clothes I've got to have them wash, too."
559,00:26:24.10,00:26:24.10,Let me go talk to them.
560,00:26:25.10,00:26:25.10,"""Ladies, um..."""
561,00:26:28.50,00:26:28.50,"HELEN:  Now, you could stand there"
562,00:26:30.50,00:26:30.50," and, you know, start demanding"
563,00:26:32.43,00:26:32.43, that they help.
564,00:26:33.73,00:26:33.73, What's that going to do 
565,00:26:34.87,00:26:34.87,for me-- get me the next vote off?
566,00:26:37.03,00:26:37.03, You got to play the game.
567,00:26:38.60,00:26:38.60," I-I'm telling you,"
568,00:26:40.20,00:26:40.20, I've worked with guys  long enough...
569,00:26:41.37,00:26:41.37,"Lower, right here?"
570,00:26:42.37,00:26:42.37,"Uh-huh, that's it. It was up at the top."
571,00:26:44.27,00:26:44.27,Sometimes you got to swallow some of that to stay alive.
572,00:26:59.70,00:26:59.70, We really have split  into a men's/women's group.
573,00:27:03.83,00:27:03.83,"With Ted, you're dealing with a macho has-been football player"
574,00:27:08.20,00:27:08.20, who's still living  in those glory days.
575,00:27:09.83,00:27:09.83, That-That's...
576,00:27:11.33,00:27:11.33,It's almost hard for any woman to break into that
577,00:27:13.43,00:27:13.43,"as a friend, um, or as a teammate."
578,00:27:17.13,00:27:17.13," Then you got Clay,  who's from an era"
579,00:27:20.77,00:27:20.77," and an area that, again,"
580,00:27:22.87,00:27:22.87, doesn't view a woman  as an equal.
581,00:27:25.40,00:27:25.40, Never gonna happen.
582,00:27:28.00,00:27:28.00, And Ghandia
583,00:27:29.23,00:27:29.23, is-- she-- it's starting  to get to her.
584,00:27:31.30,00:27:31.30," I understand why,  fully understand why, but"
585,00:27:34.10,00:27:34.10,I just don't see a need right now to cause discord in camp.
586,00:27:38.10,00:27:38.10," We, we need to focus  on our next challenge,"
587,00:27:40.97,00:27:40.97, and we need to have  everybody working together.
588,00:28:07.13,00:28:07.13,PROBST: First things first.
589,00:28:08.23,00:28:08.23,Ted.
590,00:28:12.13,00:28:12.13,Immunity back up for grabs.
591,00:28:13.90,00:28:13.90,"Yesterday's reward challenge was, without question,"
592,00:28:16.47,00:28:16.47,the toughest physically that you guys have had to endure.
593,00:28:19.17,00:28:19.17,Today's? Simple-- it's brains.
594,00:28:20.90,00:28:20.90,It is a puzzle that dates back thousands of years
595,00:28:23.03,00:28:23.03,in Asian culture.
596,00:28:24.03,00:28:24.03,It's called the tangram.
597,00:28:25.37,00:28:25.37,Here's how it works.
598,00:28:26.70,00:28:26.70,Take one sheet of wood
599,00:28:27.90,00:28:27.90,and you cut it into seven distinct shapes.
600,00:28:31.57,00:28:31.57,"With those seven shapes,"
601,00:28:32.83,00:28:32.83,you can then create an endless array of images.
602,00:28:35.87,00:28:35.87,Today you guys are going to create two images.
603,00:28:37.73,00:28:37.73,"One is fire,"
604,00:28:40.13,00:28:40.13,the second is Tribal Council in the form of a temple.
605,00:28:44.03,00:28:44.03,You'll work in pairs.
606,00:28:45.23,00:28:45.23,"Once two tribe members solve one of the images,"
607,00:28:48.10,00:28:48.10,you swap out and you bring in two new tribe members.
608,00:28:50.70,00:28:50.70,"First tribe to solve both images correctly keeps their fire,"
609,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,avoids Tribal Council.
610,00:28:56.13,00:28:56.13,"For the losers, another date with me at Tribal Council"
611,00:28:59.13,00:28:59.13,where somebody else will be voted out of the tribe.
612,00:29:01.10,00:29:01.10,"Sook Jai, you have one extra."
613,00:29:02.33,00:29:02.33,You're sitting somebody out.
614,00:29:03.40,00:29:03.40,You cannot sit the same person out.
615,00:29:04.47,00:29:04.47,You've chosen Stephanie.
616,00:29:05.63,00:29:05.63,Take your positions.
617,00:29:07.07,00:29:07.07,Wait for my go.
618,00:29:08.23,00:29:08.23,"Immunity at stake, here we go."
619,00:29:10.50,00:29:10.50,Survivors ready?
620,00:29:11.93,00:29:11.93,-Yeah. -Yes. -Go!
621,00:29:16.10,00:29:16.10,Which way is the top?
622,00:29:21.40,00:29:21.40,-This one like this. -Yeah.
623,00:29:23.60,00:29:23.60,Talk to me.
624,00:29:24.87,00:29:24.87,Talk to me on the bottom.
625,00:29:25.93,00:29:25.93,"HELEN: Clay, biggest ones are on the bottom. That one,"
626,00:29:27.60,00:29:27.60,"Ted, in your hand, that goes next."
627,00:29:28.97,00:29:28.97,"-Which one? -Ted, take the big one"
628,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,"you've got there, push it down."
629,00:29:31.23,00:29:31.23,Put the smaller one next.
630,00:29:32.33,00:29:32.33,-Like this? -The smaller triangle next.
631,00:29:34.63,00:29:34.63,I need a smaller triangle.
632,00:29:35.77,00:29:35.77,"Yeah, like that-- boom, boom, boom. Yours?"
633,00:29:38.57,00:29:38.57,"-Right here? -No, other way."
634,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23,"-This one? -No, the triangle right here."
635,00:29:42.83,00:29:42.83,"-Off the top piece, and it's not point... -Sorry, got you."
636,00:29:45.23,00:29:45.23,SHII ANN: It's obviously not the two big triangles--
637,00:29:47.60,00:29:47.60,that's all I can say-- that go in there.
638,00:29:50.33,00:29:50.33,"Take the big one out that you just put in, Ted."
639,00:29:51.97,00:29:51.97,"-Take that out, put it in the match place. -Okay."
640,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70,-Put it in the match place. Put th... -CLAY: We still don't have
641,00:29:57.00,00:29:57.00,"the base, and that's what we're after."
642,00:29:58.73,00:29:58.73,GHANDIA: Use that triangle to start your base
643,00:30:00.13,00:30:00.13,"-and build from there. -Okay, wait, wait."
644,00:30:01.37,00:30:01.37,"-There-- here... -We have, see, one triangle left."
645,00:30:02.77,00:30:02.77,"Okay, here-here's what's going to happen."
646,00:30:04.23,00:30:04.23,This is gonna have to go up here.
647,00:30:05.37,00:30:05.37,-You need to save the triangle out. -Right.
648,00:30:06.90,00:30:06.90,But here's the way it's going to go. Now we've got to fill
649,00:30:08.30,00:30:08.30,this in somehow with what we got.
650,00:30:09.97,00:30:09.97,SHII ANN: Put the square next to the little triangle.
651,00:30:12.50,00:30:12.50,ROBB: Then how's the other one going to match up?
652,00:30:14.03,00:30:14.03,"SHII ANN: That square is in the middle,"
653,00:30:15.27,00:30:15.27,and I think that little triangle's on top of it.
654,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,KEN: Switch the little triangle in the square.
655,00:30:18.37,00:30:18.37,-There you go. -There you go.
656,00:30:19.40,00:30:19.40,"-Nope. -Nope, almost."
657,00:30:22.03,00:30:22.03,"-It's got to be straight, Ted, right there. -No, it doesn't."
658,00:30:23.97,00:30:23.97,"Now, all you have to do is just put this up here."
659,00:30:25.47,00:30:25.47,That can't hang out there.
660,00:30:26.63,00:30:26.63,"-Look. Oh, okay. -That can't hang out there."
661,00:30:28.07,00:30:28.07,"-No, turn it, turn it, turn it. -No, what you had..."
662,00:30:29.40,00:30:29.40,"Just right there, right there. We're done."
663,00:30:32.00,00:30:32.00,-That's it. -We're done! -PROBST: That's it.
664,00:30:33.67,00:30:33.67,Sook Jai gets their first one. Switch out and move on.
665,00:30:35.70,00:30:35.70,"-TED: Jeff, Jeff... -PROBST: Slow, slow down."
666,00:30:37.77,00:30:37.77,-Jeff. -I'm looking.
667,00:30:39.90,00:30:39.90,Slide out.
668,00:30:40.90,00:30:40.90,Let me look.
669,00:30:42.60,00:30:42.60,That's it.
670,00:30:43.47,00:30:43.47,-Move on. -Yes!
671,00:30:44.47,00:30:44.47,"-Go. -CLAY: Next two, next two."
672,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,We are tied 1-1.
673,00:30:47.90,00:30:47.90,First tribe to complete the temple doesn't have
674,00:30:50.10,00:30:50.10,to go to the temple.
675,00:30:51.53,00:30:51.53,"Way to work together, guys."
676,00:30:55.73,00:30:55.73,You guys have already solved the fire.
677,00:30:56.87,00:30:56.87,That is your life at Tribal Council.
678,00:30:58.87,00:30:58.87,Now you're trying to complete the Tribal Council.
679,00:31:01.27,00:31:01.27,ROBB: Check it out.
680,00:31:02.27,00:31:02.27,Make it square across the top
681,00:31:04.03,00:31:04.03,of that bottom triangle.
682,00:31:04.93,00:31:04.93,"Make it flat,"
683,00:31:06.80,00:31:06.80,"just how you had it, baby, you had it right."
684,00:31:08.43,00:31:08.43,"-No, no, no. -Like this?"
685,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,"Yeah, put the square..."
686,00:31:10.90,00:31:10.90,How about putting the square...?
687,00:31:14.93,00:31:14.93,ROBB: You see what I'm saying?
688,00:31:16.77,00:31:16.77,"Like that, yeah."
689,00:31:18.33,00:31:18.33,"-That's what... -There, that's it."
690,00:31:20.60,00:31:20.60,"That's what I meant, you guys, straight, just like the picture."
691,00:31:24.47,00:31:24.47,CLAY: Yes.
692,00:31:26.57,00:31:26.57,"Now, put the other piece down here--"
693,00:31:27.70,00:31:27.70,"no, the other piece on the other side."
694,00:31:29.10,00:31:29.10,"TED: Whoa, whoa, let 'em think, let 'em think,"
695,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,let 'em think.
696,00:31:31.57,00:31:31.57,CLAY: They need to pick it back up
697,00:31:33.20,00:31:33.20,to make it across and set that down on it.
698,00:31:35.23,00:31:35.23,"Clay, let 'em think."
699,00:31:36.40,00:31:36.40,I am.
700,00:31:38.70,00:31:38.70,"-Now, how does this...? -JAKE: Now, that's got to go out"
701,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17,and make a little...
702,00:31:42.90,00:31:42.90,"There you go, that's good."
703,00:31:45.27,00:31:45.27,PENNY: Make a square.
704,00:31:46.53,00:31:46.53,Is this it?
705,00:31:47.77,00:31:47.77,"-Jeff. -Jeff, Jeff."
706,00:31:58.70,00:31:58.70,-Sook Jai... wins immunity. -(cheering)
707,00:32:05.97,00:32:05.97,"Sook Jai, yeah!"
708,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,"Sook Jai, it's going back home"
709,00:32:17.03,00:32:17.03,-with you again. -Thank you. -Yay.
710,00:32:18.60,00:32:18.60,You're free from Tribal Council three more days on the island.
711,00:32:22.03,00:32:22.03,"Chuay Gahn, unfortunately,"
712,00:32:23.90,00:32:23.90,I'll see you tonight at Tribal Council.
713,00:32:25.67,00:32:25.67,Somebody else is going home.
714,00:32:27.10,00:32:27.10,You can head back to camp.
715,00:33:03.43,00:33:03.43,"GHANDIA: We have to go  to Tribal Council, and,"
716,00:33:05.97,00:33:05.97," you know, that's just it."
717,00:33:07.23,00:33:07.23, I don't feel good about it.
718,00:33:09.03,00:33:09.03," As far as my vote's concerned,"
719,00:33:10.27,00:33:10.27, it's a toss-up  between Ted and Clay.
720,00:33:13.43,00:33:13.43," They're basically  like Mutt and Jeff,"
721,00:33:15.77,00:33:15.77,Frick and Frack.
722,00:33:17.60,00:33:17.60,"You know, they're joined at the hip."
723,00:33:19.23,00:33:19.23,Anything in your belly is good.
724,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,This is some good eating.
725,00:33:21.67,00:33:21.67,GHANDIA:  So I need
726,00:33:22.87,00:33:22.87, to explain and express  to the other two women
727,00:33:24.40,00:33:24.40," that that's our best chance  of survival,"
728,00:33:28.03,00:33:28.03," is if there's a 3-3 tie,"
729,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33," like three people vote for Clay, three people vote for me;"
730,00:33:32.70,00:33:32.70," three people vote for Ted,  three people vote for me."
731,00:33:36.23,00:33:36.23,"Otherwise, we're just going to get picked off like flies."
732,00:33:38.63,00:33:38.63,"JAN: It's divided, it's very divided."
733,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,-Right. -It's men and women.
734,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,"Yeah, and I think that basically happened"
735,00:33:44.43,00:33:44.43,because of Clay and Ted.
736,00:33:46.20,00:33:46.20,"-I agree. -Well, Clay mostly."
737,00:33:48.87,00:33:48.87,"That's right, you know, 'cause Clay has this old, old,"
738,00:33:52.20,00:33:52.20,"old, old school mentality."
739,00:33:53.53,00:33:53.53,His back is hurting and all this.
740,00:33:54.97,00:33:54.97,"Well, it's time for your ass to go."
741,00:33:56.37,00:33:56.37,-He's tired and he takes naps all the time. -Yeah...
742,00:33:58.93,00:33:58.93,JAN:  I feel Clay needs to go.
743,00:34:01.63,00:34:01.63,"Um, I think he's, he's torn the team apart."
744,00:34:05.13,00:34:05.13," I think it's the guys on one  side, the girls on the other,"
745,00:34:08.03,00:34:08.03, and I think he's been  the main team-splitter.
746,00:34:10.70,00:34:10.70, We're not a team anymore.
747,00:34:11.93,00:34:11.93, And I think he's tired.
748,00:34:14.00,00:34:14.00," Uh, he naps a lot."
749,00:34:15.20,00:34:15.20, I just think it's time
750,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,"for him to go, and maybe we could heal some of our wounds"
751,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,and come back as a team.
752,00:34:21.07,00:34:21.07,"GHANDIA: Me and Janny already talked about Clay,"
753,00:34:23.20,00:34:23.20,so we wanted to see
754,00:34:24.47,00:34:24.47,"where your head was at with voting for Clay, too."
755,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,"You're voting for Clay, not Ted?"
756,00:34:30.03,00:34:30.03,"Well, Janny doesn't want to vote for Ted"
757,00:34:32.33,00:34:32.33,because she thinks if we have another group challenge
758,00:34:34.20,00:34:34.20,"that requires a lot of strength and brawn,"
759,00:34:35.97,00:34:35.97,that she wants to keep him.
760,00:34:37.43,00:34:37.43,"-Now, you know I don't agree with that. -(Helen grunts)"
761,00:34:39.50,00:34:39.50,But if something happens
762,00:34:40.80,00:34:40.80,where you and I vote for Ted and she votes for Clay
763,00:34:42.73,00:34:42.73,"-and the three of them vote for me, I'm gone. -Yeah, uh-huh."
764,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,"But if it's a 3-3 tie where it's three for me and three for Clay,"
765,00:34:47.77,00:34:47.77,"then we'll have the two-minute conferences,"
766,00:34:49.10,00:34:49.10,"-which I'm sure will be deadlocked. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
767,00:34:51.10,00:34:51.10,-Exactly. -And then it's up to the rock in the bag.
768,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,-That's right. -But here's where I'm thinking with this.
769,00:34:54.73,00:34:54.73,"If we keep the girls together,"
770,00:34:56.07,00:34:56.07,then we have a leverage of a 3-2 vote.
771,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,-Mm-hmm. -And we can get rid of Ted next
772,00:35:00.37,00:35:00.37,'cause we won't need him too much longer.
773,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,-Mm-hmm. -But Janny is not down for voting for Ted.
774,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,"All right, all right."
775,00:35:05.33,00:35:05.33,And I can put up with Ted's bull for a couple more days.
776,00:35:07.93,00:35:07.93,You think?
777,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,"Well, yeah."
778,00:35:11.40,00:35:11.40,"-All right, all right. -I will be so happy tonight"
779,00:35:13.23,00:35:13.23,if Clay is gone.
780,00:35:24.57,00:35:24.57,(mumbles)
781,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,"HELEN: Honestly, right now  I'm still betwixt and between,"
782,00:35:36.13,00:35:36.13,"and this is where the game gets ugly,"
783,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17, because unfortunately
784,00:35:40.60,00:35:40.60, this is where the competitive  part wants to come in.
785,00:35:42.90,00:35:42.90," I want to stay,"
786,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90," I want to play,"
787,00:35:47.13,00:35:47.13,but it would mean voting Ghandia off tonight.
788,00:35:49.20,00:35:49.20,(whispers indistinctly)
789,00:35:50.40,00:35:50.40, And am I going to be  happy with that?
790,00:35:53.23,00:35:53.23," 'Cause I do believe  her side of the story, um,"
791,00:35:57.10,00:35:57.10, and Clay and Ted are doing  less and less every day.
792,00:35:59.37,00:35:59.37, It's very obvious.
793,00:36:01.10,00:36:01.10," Um,"
794,00:36:02.20,00:36:02.20,"I am the swing,"
795,00:36:03.53,00:36:03.53,"and I never thought I'd be the swing vote, but..."
796,00:36:13.93,00:36:13.93, I need to think  about it for me.
797,00:36:15.93,00:36:15.93," I really-- I've heard  all the arguments,"
798,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43, I know all the arguments.
799,00:36:18.57,00:36:18.57," I live here, I know the facts."
800,00:36:23.37,00:36:23.37, I don't know.
801,00:36:25.37,00:36:25.37,I may not even make it up until I pull the cap off the pen.
802,00:36:56.40,00:36:56.40,Another Tribal Council.
803,00:36:58.40,00:36:58.40,Yeah.
804,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,Take a look to your left.
805,00:37:02.33,00:37:02.33,Three torches
806,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,representing the first three people voted out of this game.
807,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33,"Ted, how's that sit, coming here tonight,"
808,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,knowing somebody's going home and it may be you?
809,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,"Anytime we come to the Tribal Council, it's painful."
810,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,"As painful as it is, this is the game."
811,00:37:16.70,00:37:16.70,"This is the way the game is played, so"
812,00:37:19.40,00:37:19.40,we have to basically suck it up and-and do what we have to do.
813,00:37:22.63,00:37:22.63,"Clay, what's the toughest aspect right now 12 days in?"
814,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,"Uh, th-the food, the heat, th-the whole thing."
815,00:37:29.63,00:37:29.63,"It's, uh, it's tough."
816,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,"You know, when I left home, I come here,"
817,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,my first question was: how hungry am I going to get?
818,00:37:35.60,00:37:35.60,"I'm hungry as hell, I'm gonna tell you."
819,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"I'm tired as hell, I'm weak."
820,00:37:38.90,00:37:38.90,"This humidity and this heat is bothering me,"
821,00:37:41.60,00:37:41.60,"but, uh, I-I'm still healthy and I'm still fine."
822,00:37:43.77,00:37:43.77,I'm-I'm-I'm going to the end.
823,00:37:46.13,00:37:46.13,"Helen, what kind of toll is it taking on you?"
824,00:37:48.83,00:37:48.83,I find I worry.
825,00:37:50.10,00:37:50.10,"I-I worry every day. I mean, I get up"
826,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"in the morning, thinking: ""Oh, my God,"
827,00:37:53.13,00:37:53.13,"""do we have enough water? Is it boiled?"
828,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47,"""Is it in the clean containers?"
829,00:37:55.83,00:37:55.83,"""What are we gonna get for food? Is the tide gonna go out?"
830,00:37:57.93,00:37:57.93,"""If the tide goes out, can we go out and get clams, crabs?"
831,00:38:00.17,00:38:00.17,"Are there gonna be clams and crabs?"""
832,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,"I'm just becoming obsessed out here with: ""Oh, my God,"
833,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,"the food, the water, food, water, food, water."""
834,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,And then we get a challenge thing
835,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,"and I'm like, ""Oh, my God,"
836,00:38:08.27,00:38:08.27,"""is it going to be drag another dummy over the mountain"
837,00:38:09.90,00:38:09.90,"or is it going to be brainteaser?"""
838,00:38:11.77,00:38:11.77,"And, and y-y-you know,"
839,00:38:13.03,00:38:13.03,and then coming here.
840,00:38:14.27,00:38:14.27,Talk about adding more stress to it.
841,00:38:15.70,00:38:15.70,"Oh, my God, now I got to vote somebody off."
842,00:38:17.47,00:38:17.47,"PROBST: Ghandia,"
843,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,everybody pulling their own weight
844,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,still in this tribe?
845,00:38:21.10,00:38:21.10,Nope.
846,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40,Flat-out nope?
847,00:38:23.97,00:38:23.97,"Yeah, nope."
848,00:38:25.43,00:38:25.43,"Some people are just not doing as much as they could do,"
849,00:38:29.37,00:38:29.37,and some people just don't do a lot.
850,00:38:32.40,00:38:32.40,They lay around.
851,00:38:34.00,00:38:34.00,"PROBST: Clay, everybody pulling"
852,00:38:36.03,00:38:36.03,-their own weight? -Uh...
853,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,I feel everybody's doing their part.
854,00:38:39.30,00:38:39.30,"I mean, uh, there's days"
855,00:38:40.80,00:38:40.80,that some of us lay around.
856,00:38:42.17,00:38:42.17,There's days that some of us go fishing and go off
857,00:38:45.07,00:38:45.07,and bring back mussels and go do different things.
858,00:38:48.13,00:38:48.13,It's... Just because one doesn't cook
859,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,"and the other one does,"
860,00:38:51.40,00:38:51.40,doesn't mean the other one's not gathering the food to put
861,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"in that, uh, pot."
862,00:38:54.47,00:38:54.47,PROBST: Jan.
863,00:38:55.47,00:38:55.47,Yes.
864,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,What's your take on it?
865,00:38:57.63,00:38:57.63,"I feel that, uh, the tribe is divided somewhat, I do."
866,00:39:01.00,00:39:01.00,"I do feel that we pulled together on the challenges,"
867,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,"though, as one,"
868,00:39:05.20,00:39:05.20,but I do feel there's a division.
869,00:39:07.50,00:39:07.50,It is time to vote.
870,00:39:09.70,00:39:09.70,"Ted, you're up."
871,00:39:21.13,00:39:21.13,You blew up an issue way beyond the scope of this game.
872,00:39:25.57,00:39:25.57,"For that reason, this vote is personal,"
873,00:39:28.47,00:39:28.47,"and I truly, truly hope I never, ever see you in my life again."
874,00:39:41.60,00:39:41.60,You played cat and mouse.
875,00:39:43.60,00:39:43.60,You just didn't do good-- too good at it.
876,00:39:45.83,00:39:45.83,"You got busted, so bye-bye, Denver."
877,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,"It's between you and me tonight, so let the best person win."
878,00:40:29.77,00:40:29.77,I'll go tally the votes.
879,00:40:47.33,00:40:47.33,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
880,00:40:49.63,00:40:49.63,The person voted out will be asked
881,00:40:50.77,00:40:50.77,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
882,00:40:52.90,00:40:52.90,I'll read the votes.
883,00:40:57.73,00:40:57.73,First vote...
884,00:40:59.80,00:40:59.80,Ghandia.
885,00:41:04.87,00:41:04.87,Clay.
886,00:41:07.10,00:41:07.10,"One vote-- Ghandia, one vote-- Clay."
887,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,Ghandia.
888,00:41:16.07,00:41:16.07,Clay.
889,00:41:17.37,00:41:17.37,"That's two votes-- Ghandia, two votes-- Clay."
890,00:41:25.27,00:41:25.27,"Well, for the first time I have a vote"
891,00:41:27.07,00:41:27.07,and I have no idea who it belongs to.
892,00:41:29.10,00:41:29.10,"Who wrote ""Bye-bye Denver Diva""?"
893,00:41:31.07,00:41:31.07,Who's the name?
894,00:41:32.07,00:41:32.07,-Ghandia. -Ghandia.
895,00:41:33.10,00:41:33.10,"Denver, uh, Diva."
896,00:41:35.07,00:41:35.07,"-In the future, write a name down, okay? -Okay."
897,00:41:37.37,00:41:37.37,Enough with the nicknames.
898,00:41:38.63,00:41:38.63,"That's three votes-- Ghandia, two votes-- Clay."
899,00:41:42.27,00:41:42.27,Last vote...
900,00:41:47.63,00:41:47.63,Ghandia. That's four. You need to bring me your torch.
901,00:42:05.00,00:42:05.00,"Ghandia, the tribe has spoken."
902,00:42:08.20,00:42:08.20,"Stay strong, y'all. See ya."
903,00:42:19.80,00:42:19.80,"PROBST: Well, from the outside it looked like this was"
904,00:42:22.80,00:42:22.80,a tribe that really had it together.
905,00:42:24.57,00:42:24.57,"Clearly, there was some division within the tribe."
906,00:42:27.30,00:42:27.30,Maybe tonight's vote will help solve some of that problem.
907,00:42:30.77,00:42:30.77,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
908,00:42:45.90,00:42:45.90,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode. 
909,00:42:52.07,00:42:52.07,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor:
910,00:42:53.20,00:42:53.20, Sook Jai is reminded  of the dangers
911,00:42:54.87,00:42:54.87, lurking in the sea.
912,00:42:57.70,00:42:57.70,(screams)
913,00:42:58.80,00:42:58.80, Chuay Gahn experiences  a big loss.
914,00:43:00.90,00:43:00.90,CLAY:  I have no idea
915,00:43:02.10,00:43:02.10,-what we're going to do. -I'm gonna make you an offer.
916,00:43:04.63,00:43:04.63, And an offer that could change  the entire game.
917,00:43:07.80,00:43:07.80,60 seconds-- think about this.
918,00:43:10.07,00:43:10.07,This is an individual decision.
919,00:43:17.57,00:43:17.57,"I made, um... a big mistake"
920,00:43:20.20,00:43:20.20,in trying to play one side against the other side
921,00:43:22.83,00:43:22.83,because of an event that happened to me
922,00:43:24.47,00:43:24.47,that I should have just let go.
923,00:43:25.77,00:43:25.77,"But unfortunately, the evil Ghandia came"
924,00:43:28.20,00:43:28.20,to rule her ugly head.
925,00:43:29.73,00:43:29.73,And the good Ghandia just couldn't stop her.
926,00:43:31.87,00:43:31.87,"Have fun, everybody, still sleeping out in the dirt."
927,00:43:35.13,00:43:35.13,(laughs)
928,00:43:36.13,00:43:36.13,Peace out.
