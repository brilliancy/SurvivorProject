1,00:00:01.10,00:00:01.10,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:02.87,00:00:02.87, The tribes went head to head
3,00:00:04.40,00:00:04.40, in one of the most physical challenges yet...
4,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37, and Chuay Gahn finally ended their losing streak.
5,00:00:09.90,00:00:09.90,-Yeah!-(cheering)
6,00:00:11.50,00:00:11.50," At Sook Jai, Robb was bitter about the loss."
7,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,"He's a weak, little, whiny punk.Did you hear him..."
8,00:00:16.97,00:00:16.97,"(speaking gibberish)...screaming at me, dude?"
9,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,I wanted to spit in his face.
10,00:00:20.73,00:00:20.73,PROBST: Chuay Gahn got two Red Beret survival experts
11,00:00:22.90,00:00:22.90, for 24 hours as their reward.
12,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60, But their happy family had a crisis
13,00:00:27.37,00:00:27.37, when Ted and Ghandia got a little too close for comfort.
14,00:00:30.70,00:00:30.70,Specifically he wasgrinding against-- against me.
15,00:00:33.90,00:00:33.90,PROBST: At first Ghandia accepted Ted's apology.
16,00:00:36.67,00:00:36.67,"Sometimes when I'm sleepingin the middle of the night,"
17,00:00:39.20,00:00:39.20,"I'm not, like, totally clear."
18,00:00:40.47,00:00:40.47,I'm thinking I'm sleepingwith my wife.
19,00:00:41.93,00:00:41.93,PROBST:  But the issue didn't die.
20,00:00:43.87,00:00:43.87,"He started biting meon my shoulder back here,"
21,00:00:46.03,00:00:46.03,"-like sexy biting, you know,like... -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
22,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00,PROBST: Ghandia's emotions boiled over.
23,00:00:50.23,00:00:50.23,(screaming)
24,00:00:52.87,00:00:52.87, Ted called a meeting to get things out in the open.
25,00:00:55.70,00:00:55.70,"And the excuse that you gave me,"
26,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,I thought that thatwas disingenuous.
27,00:00:58.77,00:00:58.77,"TED: That's funny, because yourcomment after I apologized"
28,00:01:01.37,00:01:01.37,"was to cry and say, ""You know,I really, really needed that,"
29,00:01:03.80,00:01:03.80,"-and I really appreciate yourhonesty."" -I did, I did."
30,00:01:05.70,00:01:05.70,"PROBST: Despite all their problems,"
31,00:01:07.93,00:01:07.93, Chuay Gahn finally won immunity...
32,00:01:09.80,00:01:09.80,"Chuay Gahn, get a little feelof this for a change."
33,00:01:12.00,00:01:12.00,(cheering)
34,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00, ...sending Sook Jai to their first Tribal Council.
35,00:01:16.20,00:01:16.20," And although Shii Ann received three votes,"
36,00:01:18.00,00:01:18.00,Jed was voted out of the tribe.
37,00:01:19.70,00:01:19.70,"Jed, the tribe has spoken."
38,00:01:22.80,00:01:22.80, 13 are left.
39,00:01:24.20,00:01:24.20, Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:36.17,00:02:36.17,(thunder rumbling)
41,00:02:45.03,00:02:45.03,ROBB: Are you guys happywith your decision?
42,00:02:46.77,00:02:46.77,JAKE: I wasn't happywith being there.
43,00:02:48.77,00:02:48.77,I'm not happy withgetting home this late.
44,00:02:51.07,00:02:51.07,SHII ANN: Didn't feel good tohave my name read out loud.
45,00:02:54.57,00:02:54.57,"It was not unexpected, you guys,but still it was like..."
46,00:02:58.73,00:02:58.73,"Yeah, I figuredI'd at least have"
47,00:03:00.10,00:03:00.10,one personcalling my name out.
48,00:03:01.33,00:03:01.33," We had Tribal Council, and, uh..."
49,00:03:03.03,00:03:03.03,"I was pretty shockedwith the outcome,"
50,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,to be completely honest.
51,00:03:07.00,00:03:07.00, I originally thought that Shii Ann
52,00:03:08.33,00:03:08.33," was going to be the one voted off,"
53,00:03:10.03,00:03:10.03,"but um, it just goesto show you, man,"
54,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,nothing's set in stoneout here.
55,00:03:14.27,00:03:14.27,PENNY: I do not want to gothrough again what we went
56,00:03:16.70,00:03:16.70,"-through tonight. -JAKE: Idon't, either. I don't ever want"
57,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,-to go through that again.-SHII ANN: Me either.
58,00:03:19.90,00:03:19.90,And I want to literally kick assin the next reward and immunity
59,00:03:23.90,00:03:23.90,to show them we're not quitters.
60,00:03:25.67,00:03:25.67,PENNY: I voted for Jed
61,00:03:27.57,00:03:27.57,'cause that's what the majority wanted to do.
62,00:03:29.73,00:03:29.73,Jed was trying to run the showaround here and be the leader
63,00:03:32.53,00:03:32.53, and wouldn't take anyone else's advice
64,00:03:34.27,00:03:34.27, if it wasn't his way.
65,00:03:36.40,00:03:36.40,And I think we madea good choice.
66,00:03:38.00,00:03:38.00,(thunder crashing)
67,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,(rain falling)
68,00:04:12.30,00:04:12.30,Good morning.
69,00:04:14.73,00:04:14.73,STEPHANIE: They got rid of Jed. Piss on 'em.
70,00:04:18.57,00:04:18.57,"I really couldn't believe it.I mean, I was shocked."
71,00:04:20.80,00:04:20.80," As hard as this is right now,"
72,00:04:22.57,00:04:22.57, I don't think you get rid ofthe people who are helping you.
73,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80, SHII ANN: We were going to go out and look for food
74,00:04:40.53,00:04:40.53," when the tide got a little bit lower,"
75,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33, but there was a bunch of squid on the beach.
76,00:04:45.17,00:04:45.17,"And, um, Stephanie found it."
77,00:04:52.20,00:04:52.20,"STEPHANIE: You know, I don't understand them at all,"
78,00:04:54.10,00:04:54.10,with food rightin front of their face
79,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97,and-and whiningabout being hungry.
80,00:04:57.33,00:04:57.33, That just disgusts me.
81,00:04:59.57,00:04:59.57,Don't burn yourlittle tootsies off.
82,00:05:01.73,00:05:01.73,"You guys, let's not use a bigpot to ever cook any seafood."
83,00:05:05.60,00:05:05.60,Let's keep the big potjust for water.
84,00:05:07.87,00:05:07.87,-I got more squid.-JAKE: You found two more?
85,00:05:10.07,00:05:10.07,You guys must noteven be looking.
86,00:05:12.37,00:05:12.37,They're layingright here in front of you.
87,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10,"JAKE: Well, actually, we'vebeen tending the fire."
88,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,STEPHANIE:All of you?
89,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,"-All five of you?-No, no."
90,00:05:18.53,00:05:18.53,Stick it where you want it.
91,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90,SHII ANN: I don't know what Stephanie's problem is.
92,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17," Honestly, I think she just feels"
93,00:05:27.57,00:05:27.57," like she's doing all of the work,"
94,00:05:29.33,00:05:29.33,which is totally not true.
95,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67," And I think she just feels like we're all idiots,"
96,00:05:34.63,00:05:34.63,"which again, is not true."
97,00:05:35.97,00:05:35.97,She just hates us.I don't know why.
98,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70,JAKE: I don't knowwhat the deal is.
99,00:05:39.27,00:05:39.27,She hasn't wanted to be a partof our group since we started.
100,00:05:42.53,00:05:42.53,Squid laying out here and allfive of them are over there
101,00:05:45.67,00:05:45.67,working on the fire or whateverthe hell they're doing.
102,00:05:47.93,00:05:47.93,The tide could come upand wash them away.
103,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,"It's kind of like the screwingin the light bulb joke,"
104,00:05:51.73,00:05:51.73,"you know, I mean, how many doesit take to build a damn fire?"
105,00:05:56.80,00:05:56.80,ROBB: This whole pieceis about done right here.
106,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,-PENNY: It'll be nice to eatthis morning. -Mm.
107,00:06:04.13,00:06:04.13,"ERIN: Stephanie, with her attitude,"
108,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30, nobody wants that around.
109,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,"You know, we have enough ofother elements going against us:"
110,00:06:11.43,00:06:11.43,"the rain, the wind, you know,"
111,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83, not having any food.
112,00:06:14.90,00:06:14.90, And then to have someone be grumpy like that...
113,00:06:17.50,00:06:17.50," If I was in her position, I would just suck it up"
114,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97," and try to, you know, fit in as well as I could"
115,00:06:22.30,00:06:22.30,so that I couldstay on the island.
116,00:06:42.43,00:06:42.43,JAN: People are getting tired.
117,00:06:44.00,00:06:44.00, There are some people on edge
118,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97, since the incident with Ted and Ghandia.
119,00:06:48.90,00:06:48.90,The mood's a little bit mellow.
120,00:06:52.20,00:06:52.20," It's kind of, um... unspoken."
121,00:06:54.77,00:06:54.77, No one's going to mention it again
122,00:06:56.43,00:06:56.43, because they had their talk.
123,00:06:57.63,00:06:57.63," Everybody was there,"
124,00:06:58.90,00:06:58.90," so each person has to process both sides,"
125,00:07:02.03,00:07:02.03, and then they have to handle it themselves.
126,00:07:03.70,00:07:03.70, But the mood is different. Um...
127,00:07:06.70,00:07:06.70,It's not as jovialas it used to be.
128,00:07:26.10,00:07:26.10,GHANDIA: I think it's stupid the way Ted's acting.
129,00:07:28.87,00:07:28.87,"It's absolutely asinine, and ifTed really wanted to let it go,"
130,00:07:32.90,00:07:32.90, then he would let it go and then it would be cool.
131,00:07:35.23,00:07:35.23, But Ted is set in the atmosphere that if Ghandia
132,00:07:37.27,00:07:37.27," comes around, don't saynothing, don't laugh, you know?"
133,00:07:39.63,00:07:39.63," It's just... it's really, it's really crappy."
134,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60, I can't make him talk to me.  That's his choice.
135,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,"That's how he's dealing with hisanger, not talking to me,"
136,00:07:46.80,00:07:46.80," not looking at me, trying to ignore me completely,"
137,00:07:49.47,00:07:49.47, like I'm not even here.
138,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80," So as a result of that, people who he's hanging around with"
139,00:07:53.63,00:07:53.63, adopt that same behavior.
140,00:07:55.07,00:07:55.07, It's a really bad feeling.
141,00:07:57.13,00:07:57.13," I feel like as a body,"
142,00:07:58.80,00:07:58.80," if Chuay Gahn was a body, then I'm the arm"
143,00:08:01.47,00:08:01.47,that got bit off by a sharkand now it's not there no more.
144,00:08:07.13,00:08:07.13,"How is it, Mama?"
145,00:08:08.67,00:08:08.67,Oh... spicy.
146,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,I like it.
147,00:08:11.93,00:08:11.93,"TED: The relationship between Ghandia and I,"
148,00:08:14.80,00:08:14.80,"I don't talk to her,I don't look at her."
149,00:08:17.30,00:08:17.30,I don't do anything with her.
150,00:08:18.80,00:08:18.80," Initially, I thought she was a very nice person."
151,00:08:21.37,00:08:21.37," However, when, um, she tried to exploit my family"
152,00:08:24.13,00:08:24.13," and really tried to damage my name, my character, etc.,"
153,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40," um, it was a totally different"
154,00:08:29.83,00:08:29.83,outlook that I had for her.
155,00:08:31.97,00:08:31.97,"And so as far as I'mconsidering,"
156,00:08:33.93,00:08:33.93, she's nonexistent.
157,00:08:34.93,00:08:34.93," I only see five people on this island,"
158,00:08:37.63,00:08:37.63," and I hope I never, ever, ever see her again in my life."
159,00:08:40.73,00:08:40.73,I-I really can't stand her.
160,00:08:42.43,00:08:42.43,"If I would've cuddled upwith one of you guys,"
161,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,I would have probably donethe same thing...
162,00:08:47.03,00:08:47.03,I'm-a tell you what. I wouldn'thave waited till morning.
163,00:08:48.43,00:08:48.43,"I'd have said, ""Ted, get your... away from me right now."""
164,00:08:51.07,00:08:51.07,Right.
165,00:08:52.07,00:08:52.07,"When I first saw Ghandia,I didn't like her."
166,00:08:53.97,00:08:53.97,"I mean, when I first saw her, Isaid, ""This is a problem woman."""
167,00:08:56.97,00:08:56.97, I was hoping she wasn't going to be on my tribe.
168,00:08:59.20,00:08:59.20, I saw a lot of trouble with Ghandia.
169,00:09:01.37,00:09:01.37,"When I first saw her, that'sjust the way I had her pegged."
170,00:09:04.00,00:09:04.00,"Then after we got out here,I thought maybe I was wrong."
171,00:09:05.97,00:09:05.97,Maybe I was a little bit wrong.
172,00:09:08.17,00:09:08.17,"But nutty buddy, did theblood come to the forefront."
173,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67,-Uh-huh.-Wow.
174,00:09:11.20,00:09:11.20,"Do I feel sorry for Ghandia?Hell, no."
175,00:09:13.83,00:09:13.83,I'm ready to get her ass backin Denver as quick as I can.
176,00:09:16.97,00:09:16.97,"If they can geta fast jet here,"
177,00:09:18.53,00:09:18.53,she needs to get on and get thehell out of here for my sake.
178,00:09:21.10,00:09:21.10,GHANDIA:So much love in the cave.
179,00:09:25.33,00:09:25.33,You can just feel all the love
180,00:09:27.20,00:09:27.20,just oozing out of the poresof the cave.
181,00:09:29.50,00:09:29.50,"Love, love,"
182,00:09:31.10,00:09:31.10,"love, love, everywhere."
183,00:09:33.80,00:09:33.80,"These six self-sacrificingpeople,"
184,00:09:37.13,00:09:37.13,commune together in this cave.
185,00:09:39.80,00:09:39.80,It's just a big love fest.
186,00:09:41.70,00:09:41.70,"Even when peopledon't talk to you,"
187,00:09:43.40,00:09:43.40,they show you that they love you
188,00:09:45.00,00:09:45.00,because they're tryingto teach you a lesson.
189,00:09:50.97,00:09:50.97,"And that's love, too, you know?"
190,00:09:59.67,00:09:59.67,This is so beautiful here.
191,00:10:01.97,00:10:01.97,It sure feels good.
192,00:10:03.50,00:10:03.50,I still didn't seetoo many fish.
193,00:10:05.17,00:10:05.17,I saw a couple of fishjumping out of the water.
194,00:10:07.40,00:10:07.40,-Yeah.-All right.
195,00:10:08.50,00:10:08.50,-Fishing is tough out here.-It is.
196,00:10:10.37,00:10:10.37,HELEN: I did work for the rape crisis center

594,00:28:23.03,00:28:23.03,in Asian culture.
595,00:28:24.03,00:28:24.03,It's called the tangram.
596,00:28:25.37,00:28:25.37,Here's how it works.
597,00:28:26.70,00:28:26.70,Take one sheet of wood
598,00:28:27.90,00:28:27.90,and you cut itinto seven distinct shapes.
599,00:28:31.57,00:28:31.57,"With those seven shapes,"
600,00:28:32.83,00:28:32.83,you can then createan endless array of images.
601,00:28:35.87,00:28:35.87,Today you guys are goingto create two images.
602,00:28:37.73,00:28:37.73,"One is fire,"
603,00:28:40.13,00:28:40.13,the second is Tribal Councilin the form of a temple.
604,00:28:44.03,00:28:44.03,You'll work in pairs.
605,00:28:45.23,00:28:45.23,"Once two tribe members solve oneof the images,"
606,00:28:48.10,00:28:48.10,you swap out and you bring intwo new tribe members.
607,00:28:50.70,00:28:50.70,"First tribe to solve both imagescorrectly keeps their fire,"
608,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,avoids Tribal Council.
609,00:28:56.13,00:28:56.13,"For the losers, another datewith me at Tribal Council"
610,00:28:59.13,00:28:59.13,where somebody else will bevoted out of the tribe.
611,00:29:01.10,00:29:01.10,"Sook Jai, you have one extra."
612,00:29:02.33,00:29:02.33,You're sitting somebody out.
613,00:29:03.40,00:29:03.40,You cannot sitthe same person out.
614,00:29:04.47,00:29:04.47,You've chosen Stephanie.
615,00:29:05.63,00:29:05.63,Take your positions.
616,00:29:07.07,00:29:07.07,Wait for my go.
617,00:29:08.23,00:29:08.23,"Immunity at stake, here we go."
618,00:29:10.50,00:29:10.50,Survivors ready?
619,00:29:11.93,00:29:11.93,-Yeah. -Yes.-Go!
620,00:29:16.10,00:29:16.10,Which way is the top?
621,00:29:21.40,00:29:21.40,-This one like this.-Yeah.
622,00:29:23.60,00:29:23.60,Talk to me.
623,00:29:24.87,00:29:24.87,Talk to me on the bottom.
624,00:29:25.93,00:29:25.93,"HELEN: Clay, biggest onesare on the bottom. That one,"
625,00:29:27.60,00:29:27.60,"Ted, in your hand,that goes next."
626,00:29:28.97,00:29:28.97,"-Which one?-Ted, take the big one"
627,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,"you've got there, push it down."
628,00:29:31.23,00:29:31.23,Put the smaller one next.
629,00:29:32.33,00:29:32.33,-Like this?-The smaller triangle next.
630,00:29:34.63,00:29:34.63,I need a smaller triangle.
631,00:29:35.77,00:29:35.77,"Yeah, like that--boom, boom, boom. Yours?"
632,00:29:38.57,00:29:38.57,"-Right here?-No, other way."
633,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23,"-This one?-No, the triangle right here."
634,00:29:42.83,00:29:42.83,"-Off the top piece, and it'snot point... -Sorry, got you."
635,00:29:45.23,00:29:45.23,SHII ANN: It's obviously notthe two big triangles--
636,00:29:47.60,00:29:47.60,that's all I can say--that go in there.
637,00:29:50.33,00:29:50.33,"Take the big one outthat you just put in, Ted."
638,00:29:51.97,00:29:51.97,"-Take that out, put itin the match place. -Okay."
639,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70,-Put it in the match place. Putth... -CLAY: We still don't have
640,00:29:57.00,00:29:57.00,"the base, and that'swhat we're after."
641,00:29:58.73,00:29:58.73,GHANDIA: Use that triangleto start your base
642,00:30:00.13,00:30:00.13,"-and build from there.-Okay, wait, wait."
643,00:30:01.37,00:30:01.37,"-There-- here... -We have,see, one triangle left."
644,00:30:02.77,00:30:02.77,"Okay, here-here'swhat's going to happen."
645,00:30:04.23,00:30:04.23,This is gonna haveto go up here.
646,00:30:05.37,00:30:05.37,-You need to save thetriangle out. -Right.
647,00:30:06.90,00:30:06.90,But here's the way it's goingto go. Now we've got to fill
648,00:30:08.30,00:30:08.30,this in somehowwith what we got.
649,00:30:09.97,00:30:09.97,SHII ANN: Put the squarenext to the little triangle.
650,00:30:12.50,00:30:12.50,ROBB: Then how's the other onegoing to match up?
651,00:30:14.03,00:30:14.03,"SHII ANN:That square is in the middle,"
652,00:30:15.27,00:30:15.27,and I think that littletriangle's on top of it.
653,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,KEN: Switch the little trianglein the square.
654,00:30:18.37,00:30:18.37,-There you go.-There you go.
655,00:30:19.40,00:30:19.40,"-Nope.-Nope, almost."
656,00:30:22.03,00:30:22.03,"-It's got to be straight, Ted,right there. -No, it doesn't."
657,00:30:23.97,00:30:23.97,"Now, all you have to dois just put this up here."
658,00:30:25.47,00:30:25.47,That can't hang out there.
659,00:30:26.63,00:30:26.63,"-Look. Oh, okay.-That can't hang out there."
660,00:30:28.07,00:30:28.07,"-No, turn it, turn it, turn it.-No, what you had..."
661,00:30:29.40,00:30:29.40,"Just right there, right there.We're done."
662,00:30:32.00,00:30:32.00,-That's it. -We're done!-PROBST: That's it.
663,00:30:33.67,00:30:33.67,Sook Jai gets their first one.Switch out and move on.
664,00:30:35.70,00:30:35.70,"-TED: Jeff, Jeff...-PROBST: Slow, slow down."
665,00:30:37.77,00:30:37.77,-Jeff.-I'm looking.
666,00:30:39.90,00:30:39.90,Slide out.
667,00:30:40.90,00:30:40.90,Let me look.
668,00:30:42.60,00:30:42.60,That's it.
669,00:30:43.47,00:30:43.47,-Move on.-Yes!
670,00:30:44.47,00:30:44.47,"-Go.-CLAY: Next two, next two."
671,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,We are tied 1-1.
672,00:30:47.90,00:30:47.90,First tribe to completethe temple doesn't have
673,00:30:50.10,00:30:50.10,to go to the temple.
674,00:30:51.53,00:30:51.53,"Way to work together, guys."
675,00:30:55.73,00:30:55.73,You guys have alreadysolved the fire.
676,00:30:56.87,00:30:56.87,That is your lifeat Tribal Council.
677,00:30:58.87,00:30:58.87,Now you're trying to completethe Tribal Council.
678,00:31:01.27,00:31:01.27,ROBB:Check it out.
679,00:31:02.27,00:31:02.27,Make it square across the top
680,00:31:04.03,00:31:04.03,of that bottom triangle.
681,00:31:04.93,00:31:04.93,"Make it flat,"
682,00:31:06.80,00:31:06.80,"just how you had it, baby,you had it right."
683,00:31:08.43,00:31:08.43,"-No, no, no.-Like this?"
684,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,"Yeah, put the square..."
685,00:31:10.90,00:31:10.90,How about putting the square...?
686,00:31:14.93,00:31:14.93,ROBB:You see what I'm saying?
687,00:31:16.77,00:31:16.77,"Like that, yeah."
688,00:31:18.33,00:31:18.33,"-That's what...-There, that's it."
689,00:31:20.60,00:31:20.60,"That's what I meant, you guys,straight, just like the picture."
690,00:31:24.47,00:31:24.47,CLAY:Yes.
691,00:31:26.57,00:31:26.57,"Now, put the other piecedown here--"
692,00:31:27.70,00:31:27.70,"no, the other pieceon the other side."
693,00:31:29.10,00:31:29.10,"TED: Whoa, whoa,let 'em think, let 'em think,"
694,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,let 'em think.
695,00:31:31.57,00:31:31.57,CLAY:They need to pick it back up
696,00:31:33.20,00:31:33.20,to make it acrossand set that down on it.
697,00:31:35.23,00:31:35.23,"Clay, let 'em think."
698,00:31:36.40,00:31:36.40,I am.
699,00:31:38.70,00:31:38.70,"-Now, how does this...?-JAKE: Now, that's got to go out"
700,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17,and make a little...
701,00:31:42.90,00:31:42.90,"There you go, that's good."
702,00:31:45.27,00:31:45.27,PENNY:Make a square.
703,00:31:46.53,00:31:46.53,Is this it?
704,00:31:47.77,00:31:47.77,"-Jeff.-Jeff, Jeff."
705,00:31:58.70,00:31:58.70,-Sook Jai... wins immunity.-(cheering)
706,00:32:05.97,00:32:05.97,"Sook Jai, yeah!"
707,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,"Sook Jai, it's going back home"
708,00:32:17.03,00:32:17.03,-with you again.-Thank you. -Yay.
709,00:32:18.60,00:32:18.60,You're free from Tribal Councilthree more days on the island.
710,00:32:22.03,00:32:22.03,"Chuay Gahn, unfortunately,"
711,00:32:23.90,00:32:23.90,I'll see you tonightat Tribal Council.
712,00:32:25.67,00:32:25.67,Somebody else is going home.
713,00:32:27.10,00:32:27.10,You can head back to camp.
714,00:33:03.43,00:33:03.43,"GHANDIA: We have to go to Tribal Council, and,"
715,00:33:05.97,00:33:05.97," you know, that's just it."
716,00:33:07.23,00:33:07.23, I don't feel good about it.
717,00:33:09.03,00:33:09.03," As far as my vote's concerned,"
718,00:33:10.27,00:33:10.27, it's a toss-up between Ted and Clay.
719,00:33:13.43,00:33:13.43," They're basically like Mutt and Jeff,"
720,00:33:15.77,00:33:15.77,Frick and Frack.
721,00:33:17.60,00:33:17.60,"You know, they're joinedat the hip."
722,00:33:19.23,00:33:19.23,Anything in your belly is good.
723,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,This is some good eating.
724,00:33:21.67,00:33:21.67,GHANDIA: So I need
725,00:33:22.87,00:33:22.87, to explain and express to the other two women
726,00:33:24.40,00:33:24.40," that that's our best chance of survival,"
727,00:33:28.03,00:33:28.03," is if there's a 3-3 tie,"
728,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33," like three people vote forClay, three people vote for me;"
729,00:33:32.70,00:33:32.70," three people vote for Ted, three people vote for me."
730,00:33:36.23,00:33:36.23,"Otherwise, we're just goingto get picked off like flies."
731,00:33:38.63,00:33:38.63,"JAN:It's divided, it's very divided."
732,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,-Right.-It's men and women.
733,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,"Yeah, and I thinkthat basically happened"
734,00:33:44.43,00:33:44.43,because of Clay and Ted.
735,00:33:46.20,00:33:46.20,"-I agree.-Well, Clay mostly."
736,00:33:48.87,00:33:48.87,"That's right, you know,'cause Clay has this old, old,"
737,00:33:52.20,00:33:52.20,"old, old school mentality."
738,00:33:53.53,00:33:53.53,His back is hurtingand all this.
739,00:33:54.97,00:33:54.97,"Well, it's timefor your ass to go."
740,00:33:56.37,00:33:56.37,-He's tired and he takes napsall the time. -Yeah...
741,00:33:58.93,00:33:58.93,JAN: I feel Clay needs to go.
742,00:34:01.63,00:34:01.63,"Um, I think he's, he's tornthe team apart."
743,00:34:05.13,00:34:05.13," I think it's the guys on one side, the girls on the other,"
744,00:34:08.03,00:34:08.03, and I think he's been the main team-splitter.
745,00:34:10.70,00:34:10.70, We're not a team anymore.
746,00:34:11.93,00:34:11.93, And I think he's tired.
747,00:34:14.00,00:34:14.00," Uh, he naps a lot."
748,00:34:15.20,00:34:15.20, I just think it's time
749,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,"for him to go, and maybewe could heal some of our wounds"
750,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,and come back as a team.
751,00:34:21.07,00:34:21.07,"GHANDIA: Me and Jannyalready talked about Clay,"
752,00:34:23.20,00:34:23.20,so we wanted to see
753,00:34:24.47,00:34:24.47,"where your head was atwith voting for Clay, too."
754,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,"You're voting for Clay, not Ted?"
755,00:34:30.03,00:34:30.03,"Well, Janny doesn't wantto vote for Ted"
756,00:34:32.33,00:34:32.33,because she thinks if we haveanother group challenge
757,00:34:34.20,00:34:34.20,"that requires a lotof strength and brawn,"
758,00:34:35.97,00:34:35.97,that she wants to keep him.
759,00:34:37.43,00:34:37.43,"-Now, you know I don't agreewith that. -(Helen grunts)"
760,00:34:39.50,00:34:39.50,But if something happens
761,00:34:40.80,00:34:40.80,where you and I vote for Tedand she votes for Clay
762,00:34:42.73,00:34:42.73,"-and the three of them votefor me, I'm gone. -Yeah, uh-huh."
763,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,"But if it's a 3-3 tie where it'sthree for me and three for Clay,"
764,00:34:47.77,00:34:47.77,"then we'll havethe two-minute conferences,"
765,00:34:49.10,00:34:49.10,"-which I'm sure will bedeadlocked. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
766,00:34:51.10,00:34:51.10,-Exactly. -And then it's upto the rock in the bag.
767,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77,-That's right. -But here'swhere I'm thinking with this.
768,00:34:54.73,00:34:54.73,"If we keep the girls together,"
769,00:34:56.07,00:34:56.07,then we have a leverageof a 3-2 vote.
770,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,-Mm-hmm.-And we can get rid of Ted next
771,00:35:00.37,00:35:00.37,'cause we won't need himtoo much longer.
772,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,-Mm-hmm. -But Janny is not downfor voting for Ted.
773,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,"All right, all right."
774,00:35:05.33,00:35:05.33,And I can put up with Ted's bullfor a couple more days.
775,00:35:07.93,00:35:07.93,You think?
776,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,"Well, yeah."
777,00:35:11.40,00:35:11.40,"-All right, all right.-I will be so happy tonight"
778,00:35:13.23,00:35:13.23,if Clay is gone.
779,00:35:24.57,00:35:24.57,(mumbles)
780,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,"HELEN: Honestly, right now I'm still betwixt and between,"
781,00:35:36.13,00:35:36.13,"and this iswhere the game gets ugly,"
782,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17, because unfortunately
783,00:35:40.60,00:35:40.60, this is where the competitive part wants to come in.
784,00:35:42.90,00:35:42.90," I want to stay,"
785,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90," I want to play,"
786,00:35:47.13,00:35:47.13,but it would mean votingGhandia off tonight.
787,00:35:49.20,00:35:49.20,(whispers indistinctly)
788,00:35:50.40,00:35:50.40, And am I going to be happy with that?
789,00:35:53.23,00:35:53.23," 'Cause I do believe her side of the story, um,"
790,00:35:57.10,00:35:57.10, and Clay and Ted are doing less and less every day.
791,00:35:59.37,00:35:59.37, It's very obvious.
792,00:36:01.10,00:36:01.10," Um,"
793,00:36:02.20,00:36:02.20,"I am the swing,"
794,00:36:03.53,00:36:03.53,"and I never thought I'd bethe swing vote, but..."
795,00:36:13.93,00:36:13.93, I need to think about it for me.
796,00:36:15.93,00:36:15.93," I really-- I've heard all the arguments,"
797,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43, I know all the arguments.
798,00:36:18.57,00:36:18.57," I live here, I know the facts."
799,00:36:23.37,00:36:23.37, I don't know.
800,00:36:25.37,00:36:25.37,I may not even make it up untilI pull the cap off the pen.
801,00:36:56.40,00:36:56.40,Another Tribal Council.
802,00:36:58.40,00:36:58.40,Yeah.
803,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,Take a look to your left.
804,00:37:02.33,00:37:02.33,Three torches
805,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,representing the first threepeople voted out of this game.
806,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33,"Ted, how's that sit,coming here tonight,"
807,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,knowing somebody's going homeand it may be you?
808,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,"Anytime we come to theTribal Council, it's painful."
809,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,"As painful as it is,this is the game."
810,00:37:16.70,00:37:16.70,"This is the waythe game is played, so"
811,00:37:19.40,00:37:19.40,we have to basically suck it upand-and do what we have to do.
812,00:37:22.63,00:37:22.63,"Clay, what's the toughest aspectright now 12 days in?"
813,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,"Uh, th-the food, the heat,th-the whole thing."
814,00:37:29.63,00:37:29.63,"It's, uh, it's tough."
815,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,"You know, when I left home,I come here,"
816,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,my first question was:how hungry am I going to get?
817,00:37:35.60,00:37:35.60,"I'm hungry as hell,I'm gonna tell you."
818,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"I'm tired as hell, I'm weak."
819,00:37:38.90,00:37:38.90,"This humidity and this heatis bothering me,"
820,00:37:41.60,00:37:41.60,"but, uh, I-I'm still healthyand I'm still fine."
821,00:37:43.77,00:37:43.77,I'm-I'm-I'm going to the end.
822,00:37:46.13,00:37:46.13,"Helen, what kind of tollis it taking on you?"
823,00:37:48.83,00:37:48.83,I find I worry.
824,00:37:50.10,00:37:50.10,"I-I worry every day.I mean, I get up"
825,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"in the morning, thinking:""Oh, my God,"
826,00:37:53.13,00:37:53.13,"""do we have enough water?Is it boiled?"
827,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47,"""Is it in the clean containers?"
828,00:37:55.83,00:37:55.83,"""What are we gonna get for food?Is the tide gonna go out?"
829,00:37:57.93,00:37:57.93,"""If the tide goes out, can we goout and get clams, crabs?"
830,00:38:00.17,00:38:00.17,"Are there gonna beclams and crabs?"""
831,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,"I'm just becoming obsessed outhere with: ""Oh, my God,"
832,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,"the food, the water, food,water, food, water."""
833,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,And then we geta challenge thing
834,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,"and I'm like, ""Oh, my God,"
835,00:38:08.27,00:38:08.27,"""is it going to be drag anotherdummy over the mountain"

838,00:38:13.03,00:38:13.03,and then coming here.
839,00:38:14.27,00:38:14.27,Talk about addingmore stress to it.
840,00:38:15.70,00:38:15.70,"Oh, my God, now I gotto vote somebody off."
841,00:38:17.47,00:38:17.47,"PROBST:Ghandia,"
842,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,everybody pullingtheir own weight

844,00:38:21.10,00:38:21.10,Nope.
845,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40,Flat-out nope?
846,00:38:23.97,00:38:23.97,"Yeah, nope."
847,00:38:25.43,00:38:25.43,"Some people are just not doingas much as they could do,"
848,00:38:29.37,00:38:29.37,and some peoplejust don't do a lot.
849,00:38:32.40,00:38:32.40,They lay around.
850,00:38:34.00,00:38:34.00,"PROBST:Clay, everybody pulling"
851,00:38:36.03,00:38:36.03,-their own weight?-Uh...
852,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,I feel everybody's doingtheir part.
853,00:38:39.30,00:38:39.30,"I mean, uh, there's days"
854,00:38:40.80,00:38:40.80,that some of us lay around.
855,00:38:42.17,00:38:42.17,There's days that some of usgo fishing and go off
856,00:38:45.07,00:38:45.07,and bring back musselsand go do different things.
857,00:38:48.13,00:38:48.13,It's... Just becauseone doesn't cook
858,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,"and the other one does,"
859,00:38:51.40,00:38:51.40,doesn't mean the other one'snot gathering the food to put
860,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"in that, uh, pot."
861,00:38:54.47,00:38:54.47,PROBST:Jan.

863,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,What's your take on it?
864,00:38:57.63,00:38:57.63,"I feel that, uh, the tribeis divided somewhat, I do."
865,00:39:01.00,00:39:01.00,"I do feel that we pulledtogether on the challenges,"
866,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,"though, as one,"
867,00:39:05.20,00:39:05.20,but I do feelthere's a division.
868,00:39:07.50,00:39:07.50,It is time to vote.
869,00:39:09.70,00:39:09.70,"Ted, you're up."
870,00:39:21.13,00:39:21.13,You blew up an issue way beyondthe scope of this game.
871,00:39:25.57,00:39:25.57,"For that reason,this vote is personal,"
872,00:39:28.47,00:39:28.47,"and I truly, truly hope I never,ever see you in my life again."
873,00:39:41.60,00:39:41.60,You played cat and mouse.
874,00:39:43.60,00:39:43.60,You just didn't do good--too good at it.
875,00:39:45.83,00:39:45.83,"You got busted,so bye-bye, Denver."
876,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,"It's between you and me tonight,so let the best person win."
877,00:40:29.77,00:40:29.77,I'll go tally the votes.
878,00:40:47.33,00:40:47.33,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
879,00:40:49.63,00:40:49.63,The person voted outwill be asked
880,00:40:50.77,00:40:50.77,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
881,00:40:52.90,00:40:52.90,I'll read the votes.
882,00:40:57.73,00:40:57.73,First vote...

887,00:41:16.07,00:41:16.07,Clay.
888,00:41:17.37,00:41:17.37,"That's two votes-- Ghandia,two votes-- Clay."
889,00:41:25.27,00:41:25.27,"Well, for the first timeI have a vote"
890,00:41:27.07,00:41:27.07,and I have no ideawho it belongs to.
891,00:41:29.10,00:41:29.10,"Who wrote ""Bye-bye Denver Diva""?"
892,00:41:31.07,00:41:31.07,Who's the name?
893,00:41:32.07,00:41:32.07,-Ghandia.-Ghandia.
894,00:41:33.10,00:41:33.10,"Denver, uh, Diva."
895,00:41:35.07,00:41:35.07,"-In the future, writea name down, okay? -Okay."
896,00:41:37.37,00:41:37.37,Enough with the nicknames.
897,00:41:38.63,00:41:38.63,"That's three votes-- Ghandia,two votes-- Clay."
898,00:41:42.27,00:41:42.27,Last vote...
899,00:41:47.63,00:41:47.63,Ghandia. That's four.You need to bring me your torch.
900,00:42:05.00,00:42:05.00,"Ghandia, the tribe has spoken."
901,00:42:08.20,00:42:08.20,"Stay strong, y'all.See ya."
902,00:42:19.80,00:42:19.80,"PROBST: Well, from the outsideit looked like this was"
903,00:42:22.80,00:42:22.80,a tribe that really had ittogether.
904,00:42:24.57,00:42:24.57,"Clearly, there was some divisionwithin the tribe."
905,00:42:27.30,00:42:27.30,Maybe tonight's vote will helpsolve some of that problem.
906,00:42:30.77,00:42:30.77,Grab your torches.Head back to camp.
907,00:42:45.90,00:42:45.90,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

914,00:43:02.10,00:43:02.10,-what we're going to do.-I'm gonna make you an offer.
915,00:43:04.63,00:43:04.63, And an offer that could change the entire game.
916,00:43:07.80,00:43:07.80,60 seconds-- think about this.
917,00:43:10.07,00:43:10.07,This is an individual decision.
918,00:43:17.57,00:43:17.57,"I made, um... a big mistake"
919,00:43:20.20,00:43:20.20,in trying to play one sideagainst the other side
920,00:43:22.83,00:43:22.83,because of an eventthat happened to me
921,00:43:24.47,00:43:24.47,that I should have just let go.
922,00:43:25.77,00:43:25.77,"But unfortunately,the evil Ghandia came"
923,00:43:28.20,00:43:28.20,to rule her ugly head.
924,00:43:29.73,00:43:29.73,And the good Ghandiajust couldn't stop her.
925,00:43:31.87,00:43:31.87,"Have fun, everybody,still sleeping out in the dirt."
926,00:43:35.13,00:43:35.13,(laughs)
