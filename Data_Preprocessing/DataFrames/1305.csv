57,00:03:29.83,00:03:29.83,now that the top dog is gone. I think they're definitely
58,00:03:32.62,00:03:32.62,trying to prove themselves to the women so that the women
59,00:03:35.21,00:03:35.21,don't try to overthrow all the guys.

193,00:14:33.88,00:14:33.88,"coconuts. >> Okay, okay."
194,00:14:35.04,00:14:35.04,>> We need some coconut pieces and then some salt water.
195,00:14:38.25,00:14:38.25,>> I think Cristina thinks she's an asset because she cooks our
196,00:14:41.12,00:14:41.12,"food. But you know, it's not that hard"
197,00:14:43.71,00:14:43.71,to throw together a coconut stew.
198,00:14:46.12,00:14:46.12,>> And then we'll put the crabs with the octopus.
199,00:14:48.96,00:14:48.96,"And if it doesn't taste good, don't tell me."
200,00:14:52.12,00:14:52.12,And we got to get that pot so we can drink water.
201,00:14:54.50,00:14:54.50,"Oh, you know what? We need salt water in there."
202,00:14:56.88,00:14:56.88,"Yeah, and then we need some more salt water in that."
203,00:14:59.67,00:14:59.67,">> She tells people, points things, ""Can you do this?"
204,00:15:03.04,00:15:03.04,"Can you do that?"" >> Can you grab that?"
205,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,"After we cut up the octopus, Cristina grabbed a pot full of"
206,00:15:11.83,00:15:11.83,"it, and I grabbed the knives and the cutting boards to wash"
207,00:15:14.46,00:15:14.46,"those. And I said, ""Oh, I'm going back"
208,00:15:16.08,00:15:16.08,"up."" >> Somebody help!"
209,00:15:28.00,00:15:28.00,Can one of you guys help? I got the octopus out of the
210,00:15:30.08,00:15:30.08,pot. >> The octopus spilled all over
211,00:15:31.92,00:15:31.92,the place. >> I'm going to go assess the
212,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,damage. >> I almost lost it all.
213,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,"I thought Jenny was right here, and I was trying to wash it, and"
214,00:15:49.62,00:15:49.62,"everything started falling out. I'm like ""Hello?"""
215,00:15:52.25,00:15:52.25,>> We need to be careful with it.
216,00:15:53.12,00:15:53.12,"I mean... >> I know, but I couldn't do it"
217,00:15:54.96,00:15:54.96,"myself, so... >> I worked hard this morning to"
218,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,"get the octopus, and then Cristina dropped the bucket, and"
219,00:16:04.08,00:16:04.08,there were pieces of octopus now all over the water.
220,00:16:07.75,00:16:07.75,So that really bothered me. I don't know what she was
221,00:16:10.54,00:16:10.54,thinking. They said they got it all back.
222,00:16:13.21,00:16:13.21,She said that she thought you were there.
223,00:16:14.83,00:16:14.83,>> What? >> I don't know... I don't
224,00:16:18.67,00:16:18.67,know... I don't know what's going on.
225,00:16:21.08,00:16:21.08,">> Oh, come on. >> She came with the pot."
226,00:16:23.58,00:16:23.58,I came with the knives and the cutting board.
227,00:16:25.33,00:16:25.33,"That's what I was cleaning off. Adam goes, ""She thought you""--"
228,00:16:29.12,00:16:29.12,"meaning me, I was right there next to her."
229,00:16:32.42,00:16:32.42,"And I'm thinking, ""She going to blame me for losing the"
230,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,"octopus?"" You don't need two people to"
231,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,clean up octopus. >> Yeah.
232,00:16:40.79,00:16:40.79,>> Cristina is coming across as like our new J.P.
233,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,"So she better watch herself. >> Yul, do you want to go out"
234,00:17:01.21,00:17:01.21,fishing? >> I'd like to try to catching a
235,00:17:03.92,00:17:03.92,chicken. >> Okay.
236,00:17:09.12,00:17:09.12,>> We're thinking about making an expedition to go check out
237,00:17:11.12,00:17:11.12,the island over there. We're starting to run out of
238,00:17:13.75,00:17:13.75,"resources over here, so we're going to go check it out."
239,00:17:32.58,00:17:32.58,">> Cao Boi, Ozzy, and Jessica are setting up to go on an"
240,00:17:36.54,00:17:36.54,expedition to explore out in the lagoon.
241,00:17:39.42,00:17:39.42,It's going to take a lot of energy to paddle out there and
242,00:17:41.29,00:17:41.29,paddle back. So that's the reason I'm not
243,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,"going. You know, I think the three of"
244,00:17:45.42,00:17:45.42,"them, they're kind of sticking together, they're trying to grab"
245,00:17:47.92,00:17:47.92,somebody along with them to vote.
246,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,">> Sundra, you want to come? It would be four of us."
247,00:17:59.67,00:17:59.67,">> Cao Boi, Flicka, and Ozzy wanted me to go with them, but I"
248,00:18:02.33,00:18:02.33,"wasn't trying to do that, because being out there hours"
249,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,"with them alone, that was not going to be fun."
250,00:18:07.75,00:18:07.75,"Because I know that they want to try to prod me more, and it gets"
251,00:18:10.50,00:18:10.50,"uncomfortable, and I'd rather not be in that position."
252,00:18:17.33,00:18:17.33,>> I'm going to chop this one up because I'm kind of hungry.
253,00:18:20.00,00:18:20.00,"Right now we have our solid four alliance: myself, Jonathan,"
254,00:18:23.71,00:18:23.71,"Becky, and Candice. Cao Boi and Flicka voted with us"
255,00:18:26.54,00:18:26.54,"last tribal council, but it's just hard to be in any kind of"
256,00:18:29.12,00:18:29.12,strategic alliance with them because you have no idea what's
257,00:18:31.25,00:18:31.25,going to happen on a day-to-day basis.
258,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,You want to chat? We need a fifth in order to have
259,00:18:35.79,00:18:35.79,the numbers. >> What's going on?
260,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,">> Sundra, I think, is someone that everyone is kind of leaning"
261,00:18:41.25,00:18:41.25,towards because she seems not to be a manipulative person.
262,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,"She seems that if she were to commit, that she would be very"
263,00:18:46.29,00:18:46.29,"dependable. And you know, she's kind of out"
264,00:18:48.38,00:18:48.38,"here by herself, and I think she's looking for a home."
265,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,"We just want to lock down the final five, a strong alliance."
266,00:18:53.88,00:18:53.88,We want to find the people who aren't going to waiver.
267,00:18:55.79,00:18:55.79,>> I'm definitely... I'm definitely down.
268,00:18:57.46,00:18:57.46,>> Okay. >> I am down.
269,00:18:59.21,00:18:59.21,Have you spoken to Ozzy? >> No.
270,00:19:01.00,00:19:01.00,">> No, I mean... >> We're just trying to read"
271,00:19:02.50,00:19:02.50,"him. >> I like you, all right?"
272,00:19:04.21,00:19:04.21,And I think everyone else does too.
273,00:19:06.12,00:19:06.12,"And personally, I don't know, I mean, Ozzy seems like an okay"
274,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,"guy, but I just... I don't trust him."
275,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,"I don't know why. >> No, for sure."
276,00:19:12.00,00:19:12.00,">> We trust you. >> If it definitely... you know,"
277,00:19:14.21,00:19:14.21,"if we have to, unfortunately, go to council, I'm part of the"
278,00:19:17.21,00:19:17.21,five. >> Okay.
279,00:19:22.75,00:19:22.75,">> My position in the tribe, I don't know, I mean, you know,"
280,00:19:26.42,00:19:26.42,I've had people come and tell me that they want me to be in their
281,00:19:28.42,00:19:28.42,alliance. Of course that feels good.
282,00:19:30.88,00:19:30.88,I'm very happy that I got over that hurdle of being the
283,00:19:33.42,00:19:33.42,"outsider, and I genuinely feel that I'm a part of this alliance"
284,00:19:38.29,00:19:38.29,now. But who knows?
285,00:19:40.88,00:19:40.88,"I mean, that could change five minutes from now."
286,00:19:42.75,00:19:42.75,"I just have to see. >> Yeah, we just found us a"
287,00:20:08.33,00:20:08.33,different island. We figured we should take a
288,00:20:09.96,00:20:09.96,"little expedition, see what we can get."
289,00:20:12.62,00:20:12.62,>> I'm excited. It's like having a picnic.
290,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,>> A-ha. This is gold.
291,00:20:22.42,00:20:22.42,"Looking for the noni, because we've got a lot of cuts, see?"
292,00:20:26.67,00:20:26.67,That guy right there. Just got cuts all over the
293,00:20:29.79,00:20:29.79,"place, and noni's a really good antiseptic, keeps us nice and"
294,00:20:33.33,00:20:33.33,"healthy. We get some more coconuts, and"
295,00:20:36.08,00:20:36.08,who knows what else we'll find out here?
296,00:20:42.08,00:20:42.08,( laughter ) >> How you doing?
297,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,>> Why is this tribe coming our way?
298,00:20:54.17,00:20:54.17,>> Why is their tribe here? >> Yeah.
299,00:20:55.58,00:20:55.58,">> We are exploring, playing around."
300,00:21:01.12,00:21:01.12,>> Are you going to welcome us into your home or not?
301,00:21:02.96,00:21:02.96,">> Yeah, come in. >> Okay, okay, well, we're"
302,00:21:05.54,00:21:05.54,"welcome, hey. >> I'm like, ""What the..."""
303,00:21:08.42,00:21:08.42,>> I think this is meant to be. I think is meant to be.
304,00:21:10.75,00:21:10.75,"Booty man, how are you, my man? >> What's up, my brother?"
305,00:21:12.75,00:21:12.75,">> All of a sudden Ozzy, Cao Boi, and Jessica walk up, which"
306,00:21:16.42,00:21:16.42,was a huge shock. >> Parvati.
307,00:21:19.21,00:21:19.21,>> You're Par... >> Parvati.
308,00:21:20.79,00:21:20.79,>> Par... >> Parvati.
309,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,">> Parvati, Parvati. >> I didn't like it at all."
310,00:21:26.08,00:21:26.08,I don't think they should be on our island.
311,00:21:27.54,00:21:27.54,This is our turf. This is our territory.
312,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,"They got their own island. >> Oh, man, look at that."
313,00:21:32.00,00:21:32.00,They got knives. They got knives.
314,00:21:33.79,00:21:33.79,"They got whetting stones. >> It was like awkward silence,"
315,00:21:41.08,00:21:41.08,crickets chirping. Then Cao Boi launches into this
316,00:21:44.25,00:21:44.25,"huge, like, speech about Chinese symbology or something."
317,00:21:49.25,00:21:49.25,">> In our culture, we the revere the dog, the horse, the turtle,"
318,00:21:51.54,00:21:51.54,and the dragon. Those are the four creatures
319,00:21:53.29,00:21:53.29,"that we revere, okay? Every time, if you look at your"
320,00:21:55.92,00:21:55.92,"life, you'll you find a lot of dragons and monkeys and rat"
321,00:21:59.08,00:21:59.08,friends. If you guys are dragons or rats
322,00:22:00.96,00:22:00.96,"and monkeys, you find a lot of your..."
323,00:22:02.54,00:22:02.54,That's the dog. The second one is the horse.
324,00:22:05.50,00:22:05.50,"So in wartime, the horse help the soldier defend the nation."
325,00:22:09.25,00:22:09.25,"In peacetime, it helps with transportation."
326,00:22:11.38,00:22:11.38,"Giant turtle, as big as this whole area, giant."
327,00:22:15.88,00:22:15.88,>> After a while of just listening to him talk over and
328,00:22:18.79,00:22:18.79,"over and over and over again, it was a little bit much."
329,00:22:22.83,00:22:22.83,And we were kind of like all looking around at each other
330,00:22:24.88,00:22:24.88,"like ""Okay, is he going to stop talking?"""
331,00:22:27.33,00:22:27.33,>> We want to harvest some noni if you guys don't mind.
332,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,We don't have any noni. People are hurting all over.
333,00:22:34.58,00:22:34.58,>> I love it. >> You guys want to work
334,00:22:38.12,00:22:38.12,together to get some coconuts? We'll split with you.
335,00:22:51.25,00:22:51.25,>> It won't give us energy. It'll just taste better.
336,00:22:53.83,00:22:53.83,"Okay, that's true. Okay, I'm asking for too much."
337,00:22:57.04,00:22:57.04,">> Let's get out of here. >> All right, thank you."
338,00:22:59.25,00:22:59.25,">> Bye. >> Thanks, everybody."
339,00:23:01.25,00:23:01.25,>> Bye. >> It's very primal out here.
340,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,"So when the other tribe comes and invades that, I don't like"
341,00:23:06.25,00:23:06.25,"that at all. >> ""To find what you seek, a"
342,00:23:16.54,00:23:16.54,"charm of great worth, get in the right spot and look deep in the"
343,00:23:21.21,00:23:21.21,"earth."" I was in shock that they picked"
344,00:23:25.12,00:23:25.12,me to come back to Exile. I thought it was stupid for them
345,00:23:28.04,00:23:28.04,"to send me if the idol hasn't been found, because I'm sure as"
346,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,hell going to try to find it. Just like playing in a big
347,00:23:36.50,00:23:36.50,"sandbox, a million-dollar sandbox."
348,00:23:48.79,00:23:48.79,"I dug for hours, and you could bury Yao Ming in that trench."
349,00:23:53.04,00:23:53.04,"And there was no idol there. At this point, I have to assume"
350,00:23:57.38,00:23:57.38,"the idol has been found. Otherwise, I'm a complete moron."
351,00:24:07.21,00:24:07.21,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Jonathan"
352,00:24:21.67,00:24:21.67,returning from Exile Island. ( applause )
353,00:24:32.25,00:24:32.25,">> How are you guys doing? >> All right, Jonathan."
354,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,"Come on over. >> PROBST: So, Jonathan, did you"
355,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,spend some time looking for the idol?
356,00:24:41.17,00:24:41.17,>> A lot of time. Dug a big hole.
357,00:24:45.04,00:24:45.04,>> PROBST: Are the clues at a point now where you think you
358,00:24:47.12,00:24:47.12,"know where it should be? >> I think I know where it was,"
359,00:24:50.17,00:24:50.17,"but it ain't there now. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
360,00:24:54.04,00:24:54.04,ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
361,00:24:56.04,00:24:56.04,>> Yes. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
362,00:24:58.12,00:24:58.12,"Cao Boi, take back immunity. Once again immunity is back up"
363,00:25:04.21,00:25:04.21,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you are"
364,00:25:07.17,00:25:07.17,going to race to assemble stepping poles.
365,00:25:12.17,00:25:12.17,You will then use those poles to transfer two tribe members from
366,00:25:15.46,00:25:15.46,one large platform to another platform.
367,00:25:19.29,00:25:19.29,"All eight tribe members will then swim out to one final, very"
368,00:25:22.79,00:25:22.79,small tower. First tribe to get all eight
369,00:25:26.54,00:25:26.54,tribe members to the top of the tower with both feet on or above
370,00:25:30.92,00:25:30.92,"the top deck wins immunity. Losers, tribal council, somebody"
371,00:25:35.42,00:25:35.42,going home. Give you a minute to strategize.
372,00:25:38.25,00:25:38.25,We'll get started. Here we go.
373,00:25:45.42,00:25:45.42,"For immunity, survivors ready. Go!"
374,00:25:54.12,00:25:54.12,Got to build your stepping poles first.
375,00:25:57.62,00:25:57.62,"Once you have the poles you want to use, head on out to the water"
376,00:26:01.00,00:26:01.00,and start walking. Aitu making good progress on the
377,00:26:10.04,00:26:10.04,poles. Nate thinks he's got it figured
378,00:26:16.29,00:26:16.29,out. >> That's good.
379,00:26:20.29,00:26:20.29,That's it. >> PROBST: Aitu has a good
380,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,system. Raro falling behind.
381,00:26:30.25,00:26:30.25,Aitu has all three poles put together.
382,00:26:32.17,00:26:32.17,They're in the water first. Raro in the water with their
383,00:26:39.25,00:26:39.25,"three poles. >> Jenny, get up there."
384,00:26:49.12,00:26:49.12,">> Get up there, Jenny. >> Get up there."
385,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,>> PROBST: Jenny first on the pole for Raro.
386,00:26:57.21,00:26:57.21,Aitu's lead is gone as their poles fell apart.
387,00:27:02.62,00:27:02.62,"Jenny on to the second pole. >> Take it one girl at a time,"
388,00:27:07.12,00:27:07.12,guys. >> PROBST: Jessica using a very
389,00:27:12.38,00:27:12.38,"different strategy, standing straight up, trying to balance."
390,00:27:17.42,00:27:17.42,"Jenny swatting, kneeling, lowering her center of gravity."
391,00:27:26.12,00:27:26.12,"Jenny almost loses it, regains her balance."
392,00:27:33.29,00:27:33.29,"Aitu only using two poles, trying a different strategy."
393,00:27:41.88,00:27:41.88,Raro with a bit of a lead. We're still early in this
394,00:27:44.75,00:27:44.75,challenge. >> Ah!
395,00:27:49.96,00:27:49.96,">> I got it, I got it, I got it. >> PROBST: Jessica really"
396,00:28:00.25,00:28:00.25,struggling to hang on. Nice recovery.
397,00:28:04.21,00:28:04.21,"Fall off now, you will lose a lot of time."
398,00:28:09.12,00:28:09.12,Raro now drops their third pole. They're now using two poles.
399,00:28:13.12,00:28:13.12,>> Go! >> Jump!
400,00:28:14.96,00:28:14.96,>> Jump! >> PROBST: Jenny on to the first
401,00:28:16.79,00:28:16.79,platform. Raro heads back to get Parvati.
402,00:28:23.67,00:28:23.67,Jessica close enough to jump. >> One more.
403,00:28:27.29,00:28:27.29,>> PROBST: Can't do it. Raro now with the lead.
404,00:28:30.88,00:28:30.88,Parvati on the pole. Jessica across for Aitu.
405,00:28:40.96,00:28:40.96,Parvati now on her second pole. Aitu's going to have to make up
406,00:28:51.25,00:28:51.25,ground. >> We're going to have to go
407,00:28:53.58,00:28:53.58,"farther than before, guys. >> Take your time."
408,00:28:58.21,00:28:58.21,Take your time. >> PROBST: Parvati inches her
409,00:29:01.12,00:29:01.12,way on to the next pole. Aitu trying to take bigger steps
410,00:29:04.83,00:29:04.83,to make up some ground. Aitu has made up a lot of
411,00:29:19.67,00:29:19.67,"ground, but Raro still with the lead."
412,00:29:24.12,00:29:24.12,>> You got it? >> PROBST: Parvati getting
413,00:29:26.33,00:29:26.33,closer and closer to the second platform.
414,00:29:29.00,00:29:29.00,">> Go, go, go, go, go! >> One more."
415,00:29:32.42,00:29:32.42,>> PROBST: Very close. Raro has both people on the
416,00:29:43.75,00:29:43.75,platform! Everybody got to climb to the
417,00:29:45.83,00:29:45.83,top. Everybody up!
418,00:29:49.79,00:29:49.79,"Go! Raro into the water, heading to"
419,00:29:53.12,00:29:53.12,the final tower! Aitu got to get up the tower!
420,00:29:56.46,00:29:56.46,"Get up that tower and off! Get up, Sundra!"
421,00:30:04.54,00:30:04.54,"Go, go, go! Aitu in the water!"
422,00:30:11.42,00:30:11.42,Got to get all eight tribe members on or above the deck.
423,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,It's very close. Cao Boi falls off for Aitu.
424,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,"Raro, the entire tribe falls off, got to try again."
425,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,>> Get on back. >> PROBST: All eight members
426,00:30:42.29,00:30:42.29,must have their feet and their body on or above the top deck.
427,00:30:48.50,00:30:48.50,"Aitu now in the lead. Going to have to work together,"
428,00:30:52.29,00:30:52.29,"get everybody above the deck. Immunity on the line, tribal"
429,00:30:57.08,00:30:57.08,council tonight. >> Get one foot on.
430,00:31:00.21,00:31:00.21,"Come on, baby, get foot on there."
431,00:31:10.29,00:31:10.29,">> PROBST: Aitu very close, only two feet away."
432,00:31:17.08,00:31:17.08,Aitu wins immunity! ( Aitu cheering )
433,00:31:24.25,00:31:24.25,">> Damn! Aitu, congratulations."
434,00:31:42.04,00:31:42.04,"( applause ) >> Tanga, Tanga, Tangaroa,"
435,00:31:45.96,00:31:45.96,Tangaroa. >> PROBST: Aitu safe from tribal
436,00:31:48.08,00:31:48.08,"council, nobody going home. Raro Tribe is down to eight."
437,00:31:51.25,00:31:51.25,Tonight it will move down to seven.
438,00:31:53.12,00:31:53.12,"For one person, this game is about to end."
439,00:31:55.00,00:31:55.00,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
440,00:31:56.54,00:31:56.54,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
441,00:32:18.08,00:32:18.08,">> Good job, you guys, anyway. >> I think we did well."
442,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,>> We did do well. >> Okay.
443,00:32:37.75,00:32:37.75,>> All right? Everyone's cool?
444,00:32:39.71,00:32:39.71,">> We just came back from losing our challenge, and now we're"
445,00:32:42.58,00:32:42.58,faced with another tribal council.
446,00:32:44.96,00:32:44.96,"A few of us were around the fire, and it was a unanimous"
447,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,agreement to get rid of Cristina today.
448,00:32:56.12,00:32:56.12,>> Good job. That at least got three.
449,00:32:58.29,00:32:58.29,">> We're all annoyed by Cristina and how she talks a big game,"
450,00:33:00.38,00:33:00.38,yet she doesn't really perform as well around the camp.
451,00:33:06.38,00:33:06.38,>> Are you cool with that move that they're calling?
452,00:33:10.25,00:33:10.25,>> What else would it be? It'd either have to be me or
453,00:33:12.71,00:33:12.71,"her. >> No, it ain't you, mama."
454,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,>> I could easily see myself going home and getting some
455,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,mashed potatoes and gravy. >> What are you saying?
456,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,>> I said I could easily see myself getting some mashed
457,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,"potatoes and gravy. >> You've come too long, mama."
458,00:33:25.75,00:33:25.75,Stephannie kind of said how she really just wanted to get some
459,00:33:28.79,00:33:28.79,"mashed potatoes, you know, just kind of like that hint of like"
460,00:33:31.38,00:33:31.38,"""You know, I'm kind of done with the game."""
461,00:33:34.33,00:33:34.33,"I was like ""Damn, this girl's done."""
462,00:33:36.92,00:33:36.92,"You know, the other day she made that comment, saying, ""Vote me"
463,00:33:39.25,00:33:39.25,"off, guys. You know, I feel like I'm the"
464,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,"weakest link."" But that was just icing for the"
465,00:33:43.12,00:33:43.12,cake today. >> Yeah.
466,00:33:56.58,00:33:56.58,">> And I was like yeah, yeah. Stephannie kind of gave me"
467,00:34:00.33,00:34:00.33,"this... Stephannie kind of gave me this vibe like ""Are you"
468,00:34:04.50,00:34:04.50,"sure?"" And then she's like, ""Part of me"
469,00:34:08.12,00:34:08.12,"can see myself having some mashed potatoes later."""
470,00:34:10.58,00:34:10.58,>> She's done. She's knows it.
471,00:34:12.54,00:34:12.54,>> She's already mentally checked out.
472,00:34:16.25,00:34:16.25,"She told Nate that... she's like ""Part of me could really use"
473,00:34:20.04,00:34:20.04,"some mashed potatoes tonight."" >> Oh, really?"
474,00:34:23.12,00:34:23.12,">> Yeah. And if someone says that, to me"
475,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,that just means you're gone. >> You're done.
476,00:34:28.21,00:34:28.21,>> I think that Stephannie has mentally checked out.
477,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,>> Really? I think the other girls have...
478,00:34:32.92,00:34:32.92,>> Decided on Cristina? >> I'm going to think about it.
479,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,">> Yeah, keep it in the back of your mind."
480,00:34:41.92,00:34:41.92,>> Do you want to stay in the game?
481,00:34:43.67,00:34:43.67,">> Yeah, I want to stay in the game."
482,00:34:45.92,00:34:45.92,>> Because I don't know. Some people are saying that you
483,00:34:48.75,00:34:48.75,"are saying... making comments that you want to go, like you"
484,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,"want to go home and, you know, eat mashed potatoes or"
485,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,something. >> It's amazing how one little
486,00:34:58.29,00:34:58.29,"thing can just be taken out of context, you know?"
487,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,>> Everyone's trying to watch their own back right now.
488,00:35:03.38,00:35:03.38,"If you slip up and say something, they're going to use"
489,00:35:06.12,00:35:06.12,"that, and they're going to extort it and use it to their"
490,00:35:08.58,00:35:08.58,advantage. You have to really watch
491,00:35:11.00,00:35:11.00,yourself. >> Wow.
492,00:35:14.29,00:35:14.29,Me requesting mashed potatoes and gravy became table topic for
493,00:35:18.58,00:35:18.58,"everybody else at the camp. I was like, ""You know what?"
494,00:35:22.00,00:35:22.00,"I just may as well just keep my mouth shut."""
495,00:35:25.62,00:35:25.62,"I said I was just, you know, having fun, you know?"
496,00:35:28.17,00:35:28.17,I didn't expect him to take that and turn it into some big deal.
497,00:35:32.04,00:35:32.04,"Yes, I'd like to be here. But if my efforts working for"
498,00:35:36.04,00:35:36.04,"this tribe doesn't show that I want to be here, I'm not going"
499,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,to beg anyone. I don't do that.
500,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,>> I just talked to her. She says she still wants to be
501,00:35:46.71,00:35:46.71,in the game. >> That's what she told me
502,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,earlier today too. >> I think Stephannie tends to
503,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,be some dead weight on our challenges.
504,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,>> You think she's weaker than Cristina?
505,00:35:56.79,00:35:56.79,>> I think they're both pretty bad.
506,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,>> Cristina annoys the hell out of me.
507,00:36:01.21,00:36:01.21,>> She annoys the... everything she does.
508,00:36:03.21,00:36:03.21,>> Me too. >> I'm like... argh!
509,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,The only reason I switched is because Nate said that she was
510,00:36:08.62,00:36:08.62,talking about going home and getting some mashed potatoes or
511,00:36:10.79,00:36:10.79,something like that. >> No.
512,00:36:13.58,00:36:13.58,I don't think she said that. >> She doesn't want to go.
513,00:36:16.96,00:36:16.96,>> I don't think she wants to go.
514,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,"I'm voting my conscience. >> PROBST: Adam, at challenges,"
515,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,this tribe is not doing very well.
516,00:36:52.38,00:36:52.38,You're back to tribal council for the second time in a row.
517,00:36:55.08,00:36:55.08,">> I understand that, Jeff. We are improving, though."
518,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,Our communication's getting better.
519,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,"You know, we were dominating today, and it was just there at"
520,00:37:02.08,00:37:02.08,"the end. But I'm proud of us, and we'll"
521,00:37:04.21,00:37:04.21,be all right. Don't worry about us.
522,00:37:07.67,00:37:07.67,">> PROBST: Brad, who do you get along with best out of this"
523,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,group? >> I get along with pretty much
524,00:37:11.25,00:37:11.25,"everyone. And I wish could say, ""Oh, I"
525,00:37:12.83,00:37:12.83,"don't like this person,"" or, ""This person really rubs me the"
526,00:37:15.00,00:37:15.00,"wrong way."" That's not the case."
527,00:37:17.04,00:37:17.04,That really isn't the case. I get along with everyone pretty
528,00:37:19.21,00:37:19.21,"much evenly. >> PROBST: Steph, where do you"
529,00:37:21.38,00:37:21.38,think you fit in the group if I were to ask all these other
530,00:37:23.62,00:37:23.62,people? >> I really haven't formed any
531,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,close-knit bonds with anyone. I'm kind of friendly with
532,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,everyone. I bring that nice presence.
533,00:37:31.38,00:37:31.38,"And when I'm needed, I'm there. When I'm not needed, I'm not"
534,00:37:33.83,00:37:33.83,there. Just that simple.
535,00:37:36.17,00:37:36.17,">> PROBST: Nate, last tribal council, you voted out J.P., who"
536,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,"was deemed ""bossy."" So is there much more harmony"
537,00:37:42.58,00:37:42.58,"now that J.P.'s gone, or did somebody else step up and is now"
538,00:37:45.46,00:37:45.46,the new bossy person? >> I think the tribe can feel
539,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"that sometimes Cristina can be a little overpowering, a little"
540,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,"overbearing. It's kind of her attitude, and"
541,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,"it's powerful and dominant, and being told what to do sometimes"
542,00:37:58.88,00:37:58.88,"rubs people the wrong way. >> PROBST: Cristina, a big batch"
543,00:38:02.00,00:38:02.00,"of brutal honesty. >> You know, I never realized I"
544,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,was like that. Maybe because I'm out of my
545,00:38:07.12,00:38:07.12,"environment, and I'm usually around other police officers."
546,00:38:09.29,00:38:09.29,"You know, I didn't mean to offend anybody."
547,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"I mean, I'm glad you guys told me about it, and it's over with."
548,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,"If I offended you guys in any way, I'm glad you guys told me,"
549,00:38:17.00,00:38:17.00,"and I can take care of that. >> PROBST: Adam, do you think"
550,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,"this tribe, to date, has been honest with each other?"
551,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,">> I think we're honest. You know, I thought Cristina"
552,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,knew she was kind of like that way.
553,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"You know, it's just her personality."
554,00:38:33.12,00:38:33.12,"And you know, it can be a little nerve-racking sometimes."
555,00:38:39.00,00:38:39.00,">> PROBST: Rebecca, do you think this tribe should be more candid"
556,00:38:42.04,00:38:42.04,"with each other? >> Honestly, I'll know better"
557,00:38:45.62,00:38:45.62,"after tonight, because this was the most honest thing that came"
558,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,"out of council. And when we go back to camp,"
559,00:38:51.88,00:38:51.88,"I'll see how it goes. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
560,00:38:54.88,00:38:54.88,to the vote. If somebody has the hidden
561,00:38:57.88,00:38:57.88,"immunity idol, and it turns out you need to play it tonight, you"
