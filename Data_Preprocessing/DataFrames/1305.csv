190,00:14:29.25,00:14:29.25,">> Okay, we need to get... whatare we doing with that?"
191,00:14:32.17,00:14:32.17,>> It needs coconut juice.We need to have a bunch of
192,00:14:33.88,00:14:33.88,"coconuts.>> Okay, okay."
193,00:14:35.04,00:14:35.04,>> We need some coconut piecesand then some salt water.
194,00:14:38.25,00:14:38.25,>> I think Cristina thinks she'san asset because she cooks our
195,00:14:41.12,00:14:41.12,"food.But you know, it's not that hard"
196,00:14:43.71,00:14:43.71,to throw together a coconutstew.
197,00:14:46.12,00:14:46.12,>> And then we'll put the crabswith the octopus.
198,00:14:48.96,00:14:48.96,"And if it doesn't taste good,don't tell me."
199,00:14:52.12,00:14:52.12,And we got to get that pot so wecan drink water.
200,00:14:54.50,00:14:54.50,"Oh, you know what?We need salt water in there."
201,00:14:56.88,00:14:56.88,"Yeah, and then we need some moresalt water in that."
202,00:14:59.67,00:14:59.67,">> She tells people, pointsthings, ""Can you do this?"
203,00:15:03.04,00:15:03.04,"Can you do that?"">> Can you grab that?"
204,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,"After we cut up the octopus,Cristina grabbed a pot full of"
205,00:15:11.83,00:15:11.83,"it, and I grabbed the knives andthe cutting boards to wash"
206,00:15:14.46,00:15:14.46,"those.And I said, ""Oh, I'm going back"
207,00:15:16.08,00:15:16.08,"up."">> Somebody help!"
208,00:15:28.00,00:15:28.00,Can one of you guys help?I got the octopus out of the
209,00:15:30.08,00:15:30.08,pot.>> The octopus spilled all over
210,00:15:31.92,00:15:31.92,the place.>> I'm going to go assess the
211,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,damage.>> I almost lost it all.
212,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,"I thought Jenny was right here,and I was trying to wash it, and"
213,00:15:49.62,00:15:49.62,"everything started falling out.I'm like ""Hello?"""
214,00:15:52.25,00:15:52.25,>> We need to be careful withit.
215,00:15:53.12,00:15:53.12,"I mean...>> I know, but I couldn't do it"
216,00:15:54.96,00:15:54.96,"myself, so...>> I worked hard this morning to"
217,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,"get the octopus, and thenCristina dropped the bucket, and"
218,00:16:04.08,00:16:04.08,there were pieces of octopus nowall over the water.
219,00:16:07.75,00:16:07.75,So that really bothered me.I don't know what she was
220,00:16:10.54,00:16:10.54,thinking.They said they got it all back.
221,00:16:13.21,00:16:13.21,She said that she thought youwere there.
222,00:16:14.83,00:16:14.83,>> What?>> I don't know... I don't
223,00:16:18.67,00:16:18.67,know... I don't know what'sgoing on.
224,00:16:21.08,00:16:21.08,">> Oh, come on.>> She came with the pot."
225,00:16:23.58,00:16:23.58,I came with the knives and thecutting board.
226,00:16:25.33,00:16:25.33,"That's what I was cleaning off.Adam goes, ""She thought you""--"
227,00:16:29.12,00:16:29.12,"meaning me, I was right therenext to her."
228,00:16:32.42,00:16:32.42,"And I'm thinking, ""She going toblame me for losing the"
229,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,"octopus?""You don't need two people to"
230,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,clean up octopus.>> Yeah.
231,00:16:40.79,00:16:40.79,>> Cristina is coming across aslike our new J.P.
232,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,"So she better watch herself.>> Yul, do you want to go out"

234,00:17:03.92,00:17:03.92,chicken.>> Okay.
235,00:17:09.12,00:17:09.12,>> We're thinking about makingan expedition to go check out
236,00:17:11.12,00:17:11.12,the island over there.We're starting to run out of
237,00:17:13.75,00:17:13.75,"resources over here, so we'regoing to go check it out."
238,00:17:32.58,00:17:32.58,">> Cao Boi, Ozzy, and Jessicaare setting up to go on an"
239,00:17:36.54,00:17:36.54,expedition to explore out in thelagoon.
240,00:17:39.42,00:17:39.42,It's going to take a lot ofenergy to paddle out there and
241,00:17:41.29,00:17:41.29,paddle back.So that's the reason I'm not
242,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,"going.You know, I think the three of"
243,00:17:45.42,00:17:45.42,"them, they're kind of stickingtogether, they're trying to grab"
244,00:17:47.92,00:17:47.92,somebody along with them tovote.
245,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,">> Sundra, you want to come?It would be four of us."
246,00:17:59.67,00:17:59.67,">> Cao Boi, Flicka, and Ozzywanted me to go with them, but I"
247,00:18:02.33,00:18:02.33,"wasn't trying to do that,because being out there hours"
248,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,"with them alone, that was notgoing to be fun."
249,00:18:07.75,00:18:07.75,"Because I know that they want totry to prod me more, and it gets"
250,00:18:10.50,00:18:10.50,"uncomfortable, and I'd rathernot be in that position."
251,00:18:17.33,00:18:17.33,>> I'm going to chop this one upbecause I'm kind of hungry.
252,00:18:20.00,00:18:20.00,"Right now we have our solid fouralliance: myself, Jonathan,"
253,00:18:23.71,00:18:23.71,"Becky, and Candice.Cao Boi and Flicka voted with us"
254,00:18:26.54,00:18:26.54,"last tribal council, but it'sjust hard to be in any kind of"
255,00:18:29.12,00:18:29.12,strategic alliance with thembecause you have no idea what's
256,00:18:31.25,00:18:31.25,going to happen on a day-to-daybasis.
257,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,You want to chat?We need a fifth in order to have
258,00:18:35.79,00:18:35.79,the numbers.>> What's going on?
259,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,">> Sundra, I think, is someonethat everyone is kind of leaning"
260,00:18:41.25,00:18:41.25,towards because she seems not tobe a manipulative person.
261,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,"She seems that if she were tocommit, that she would be very"
262,00:18:46.29,00:18:46.29,"dependable.And you know, she's kind of out"
263,00:18:48.38,00:18:48.38,"here by herself, and I thinkshe's looking for a home."
264,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,"We just want to lock down thefinal five, a strong alliance."
265,00:18:53.88,00:18:53.88,We want to find the people whoaren't going to waiver.
266,00:18:55.79,00:18:55.79,>> I'm definitely... I'mdefinitely down.
267,00:18:57.46,00:18:57.46,>> Okay.>> I am down.
268,00:18:59.21,00:18:59.21,Have you spoken to Ozzy?>> No.

271,00:19:04.21,00:19:04.21,And I think everyone else doestoo.
272,00:19:06.12,00:19:06.12,"And personally, I don't know, Imean, Ozzy seems like an okay"
273,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,"guy, but I just... I don't trusthim."

277,00:19:17.21,00:19:17.21,five.>> Okay.
278,00:19:22.75,00:19:22.75,">> My position in the tribe, Idon't know, I mean, you know,"
279,00:19:26.42,00:19:26.42,I've had people come and tell methat they want me to be in their
280,00:19:28.42,00:19:28.42,alliance.Of course that feels good.
281,00:19:30.88,00:19:30.88,I'm very happy that I got overthat hurdle of being the
282,00:19:33.42,00:19:33.42,"outsider, and I genuinely feelthat I'm a part of this alliance"
283,00:19:38.29,00:19:38.29,now.But who knows?
284,00:19:40.88,00:19:40.88,"I mean, that could change fiveminutes from now."
285,00:19:42.75,00:19:42.75,"I just have to see.>> Yeah, we just found us a"

310,00:21:27.54,00:21:27.54,This is our turf.This is our territory.
311,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,"They got their own island.>> Oh, man, look at that."
312,00:21:32.00,00:21:32.00,They got knives.They got knives.
313,00:21:33.79,00:21:33.79,"They got whetting stones.>> It was like awkward silence,"
314,00:21:41.08,00:21:41.08,crickets chirping.Then Cao Boi launches into this
315,00:21:44.25,00:21:44.25,"huge, like, speech about Chinesesymbology or something."
