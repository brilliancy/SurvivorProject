5,00:00:17.54,00:00:17.54,"waters of the South Pacific, heading to the Cook Islands..."
6,00:00:22.58,00:00:22.58,where these strangers have volunteered to be marooned for
7,00:00:25.92,00:00:25.92,"the next 39 days. >> Stand by, guys."
8,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,>> PROBST: This is their story. You are witnessing 20 Americans
9,00:00:42.83,00:00:42.83,begin an adventure that will forever change their lives.
10,00:00:46.50,00:00:46.50,">> Hey, you see a little bucket? >> PROBST: They've been given"
11,00:00:48.75,00:00:48.75,two minutes to salvage whatever they can off this boat.
12,00:00:51.75,00:00:51.75,(chickens squawking) You need to catch that chicken!
13,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83,That is food you are gonna want. There are various items to help
14,00:00:59.21,00:00:59.21,"them. Hawaiian swings, firewood, fish"
15,00:01:02.25,00:01:02.25,"traps, bananas, lanterns, but not enough to go around."
16,00:01:06.92,00:01:06.92,They're gonna have to work together quickly...
17,00:01:09.00,00:01:09.00,>> We've got to find food. >> PROBST: ...or they'll be left
18,00:01:11.17,00:01:11.17,without. They have been divided into four
19,00:01:13.04,00:01:13.04,"very unique tribes: Asian American, Caucasian,"
20,00:01:17.46,00:01:17.46,"Latino and African American. >> Watch it, watch it, watch it!"
21,00:01:21.75,00:01:21.75,>> PROBST: It is a social experiment like never before.
22,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,Each tribe will live on their own island.
23,00:01:28.12,00:01:28.12,"For the next 39 days, they will be abandoned and left to fend"
24,00:01:32.21,00:01:32.21,for themselves. But this is more than just a
25,00:01:35.12,00:01:35.12,test of survival skills. This is also a test of social
26,00:01:38.42,00:01:38.42,skills. >> Watch your head!
27,00:01:40.33,00:01:40.33,">> PROBST: Out here, it's the impressions you make on the"
28,00:01:42.79,00:01:42.79,other castaways that determine your fate.
29,00:01:46.17,00:01:46.17,Let's go! 30 seconds!
30,00:01:48.96,00:01:48.96,>> Where's the chicken? >> Forget about the chicken.
31,00:01:51.21,00:01:51.21,Let's go! >> Someone stole the chicken.
32,00:01:53.17,00:01:53.17,">> PROBST: 20 strangers, forced to work together to create a"
33,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,new society while battling the elements and each other.
34,00:02:01.42,00:02:01.42,"Get overboard! >> Come on, come on!"
35,00:02:03.79,00:02:03.79,>> PROBST: Time is up. They must learn to adapt or
36,00:02:09.17,00:02:09.17,"they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will"
37,00:02:12.29,00:02:12.29,remain to claim the million dollar prize.
38,00:02:14.54,00:02:14.54,"39 days, 20 people, one survivor."

41,00:03:44.00,00:03:44.00,>> My first thought when I saw the tribes were split right
42,00:03:47.17,00:03:47.17,"along racial lines was, ""Oh, God, this is gonna be hard."""
43,00:03:51.88,00:03:51.88,Just because I-I-I feel like as a people that have the same
44,00:03:55.38,00:03:55.38,"ethnicity, maybe we'll kind of clash on things."
45,00:04:01.29,00:04:01.29,(grunting) >> I could care less about
46,00:04:04.08,00:04:04.08,"divisions by ethnicity. When it comes to surviving, it's"
47,00:04:07.62,00:04:07.62,a human effort. (chuckles)
48,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00,">> Row, row! >> The Asian invasion."
49,00:04:14.50,00:04:14.50,>> Row! >> I honestly was stunned.
50,00:04:17.12,00:04:17.12,"I mean, this is crazy. I mean, I... you know, on one"
51,00:04:19.67,00:04:19.67,"hand, I think it's a great opportunity, because I think"
52,00:04:21.58,00:04:21.58,it's wonderful that there's more minorities.
53,00:04:23.71,00:04:23.71,"Uh, at the same time, I'm a little bit worried that it might"
54,00:04:25.62,00:04:25.62,"play out to caricatures and stereotypes, so I don't know,"
55,00:04:28.96,00:04:28.96,it'll be interesting to see how things play out.
56,00:04:33.08,00:04:33.08,(screams) >> Different ethnic groups.
57,00:04:36.08,00:04:36.08,"I mean, is that... kosher? (laughing): I don't know."
58,00:04:40.92,00:04:40.92,"But it's a cool social experiment, I think."
59,00:05:03.58,00:05:03.58,">> ...and paddled their way away from an island, just so I could"
60,00:05:06.46,00:05:06.46,"have a good life, and here I am paddling back to an island."
61,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,">> Well, where are you from? Where are your parents from?"
62,00:05:11.75,00:05:11.75,">> Uh, Dominican Republic. When the tribes were divided, I"
63,00:05:14.92,00:05:14.92,"thought, what an advantage for the Hispanics."
64,00:05:17.54,00:05:17.54,The Hispanics all come from Caribbean or South American
65,00:05:20.42,00:05:20.42,backgrounds. So we're-we're used to being in
66,00:05:23.42,00:05:23.42,this tropical setting. >> Why don't you guys...
67,00:05:27.46,00:05:27.46,">> One, two, three. >> This is a unique opportunity"
68,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,to represent our community in a positive way.
69,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"I mean, we just show that we work hard and we play hard."
70,00:05:38.62,00:05:38.62,I think we're going to go pretty far.
71,00:05:40.21,00:05:40.21,">> Building stuff, it should be the-the shelter, plus I know how"
72,00:05:43.83,00:05:43.83,to make a toilet. >> You want the machete?
73,00:05:46.00,00:05:46.00,">> Well, no, first I'll just explain it to you, and then"
74,00:05:48.04,00:05:48.04,"we'll all know what... well, we'll be on, like, on the same"
75,00:05:49.83,00:05:49.83,page. We'll all have the blueprint.
76,00:05:51.29,00:05:51.29,>> Do you want them with us? >> Billy said that he can chop
77,00:05:52.96,00:05:52.96,"things down and make a hut and make a toilet, and I was"
78,00:05:56.04,00:05:56.04,"really fired up. You know, I mean, I didn't want"
79,00:05:58.50,00:05:58.50,"to judge him on his appearance. I mean, he's out of shape."
80,00:06:03.38,00:06:03.38,">> It was kind of obvious to me, just from the way Billy cut"
81,00:06:06.12,00:06:06.12,"the bamboo, that he didn't really know exactly what he was"
82,00:06:11.50,00:06:11.50,"doing. >> See, look-- boom, perfect."
83,00:06:14.29,00:06:14.29,>> All right. >> I had to kind of take over
84,00:06:16.21,00:06:16.21,and build the shelter. I'm kind of trying to guide
85,00:06:19.12,00:06:19.12,things without trying to step into a position of being a
86,00:06:21.38,00:06:21.38,leader because I don't want to... I do not want that to
87,00:06:23.33,00:06:23.33,happen. >> You guys want some coconuts?
88,00:06:26.08,00:06:26.08,>> Yes. >> Yeah!
89,00:06:27.96,00:06:27.96,">> Oh, you want to climb it? >> Try that."
90,00:06:30.33,00:06:30.33,">> Oh, my God! >> When I was going up the tree,"
91,00:06:33.83,00:06:33.83,"it was, uh, a straight picture right out of The Jungle Book."
92,00:06:36.04,00:06:36.04,All I thought was Mogli going up the tree.
93,00:06:38.42,00:06:38.42,"Watch out. >> Okay, go ahead."
94,00:06:41.92,00:06:41.92,>> Good. >> Awesome.
95,00:06:43.46,00:06:43.46,">> I mean, he may not be very big, but he's an athlete, and"
96,00:06:46.75,00:06:46.75,he's somebody who'd be pretty good at this game.
97,00:06:48.54,00:06:48.54,">> Really good job, man. >> Good job, dude."
98,00:06:51.33,00:06:51.33,">> I think we're all going to be able to work as a team, and"
99,00:06:53.17,00:06:53.17,I think that we have the strongest tribe out of anybody
100,00:06:56.75,00:06:56.75,else. As long as we stay fed and happy
101,00:06:59.12,00:06:59.12,"with each other, then we're going to be able to stay really"
102,00:07:01.88,00:07:01.88,strong. >> Ay!
103,00:07:04.00,00:07:04.00,>> Salud! >> Ay! Ay!
104,00:07:05.96,00:07:05.96,>> Ay! >> We did most of the work.
105,00:07:24.62,00:07:24.62,>> I'm not a first-generation American.
106,00:07:27.00,00:07:27.00,I'm not even an immigrant. I'm a refugee.
107,00:07:29.21,00:07:29.21,"I came, uh, after the Vietnam War as a refugee."
108,00:07:32.00,00:07:32.00,I'm a survivor in that way. I've survived the Vietnam War.
109,00:07:35.62,00:07:35.62,I can survive this. The Puka Tribe is actually an
110,00:07:43.17,00:07:43.17,advantage. We fly under the radar.
111,00:07:45.92,00:07:45.92,Nobody suspects these little people with slanted eyes to see
112,00:07:50.46,00:07:50.46,anything or to be strong enough to do anything or maybe don't
113,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17,even speak English. People always underestimate the
114,00:08:00.21,00:08:00.21,Asians. >> What's your name?
115,00:08:05.21,00:08:05.21,">> Yul. >> Yul, I'm Cao Boi."
116,00:08:07.46,00:08:07.46,>> Brad. >> Brad?
117,00:08:09.04,00:08:09.04,>> Yeah. >> Nice to meet you.
118,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,">> Becky. >> Becky, Cao Boi."
119,00:08:11.71,00:08:11.71,>> Jenny. >> Jenny.
120,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,"Okay, we've got time to get to know each other."
121,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,"Jenny? >> Our tribe, Puka, is comprised"
122,00:08:17.00,00:08:17.00,"of five Asians. I'm Filipino, Yul is Korean,"
123,00:08:22.17,00:08:22.17,"Becky is Korean. Um, Brad is a mix Filipino,"
124,00:08:26.21,00:08:26.21,"Hawaiian, and Cao Boi is Vietnamese."
125,00:08:30.12,00:08:30.12,"We're a mixed group ourselves, you know, within the Asian"
126,00:08:34.21,00:08:34.21,community. >> My grandmother's knife is
127,00:08:36.83,00:08:36.83,"sharper than this. You know, I was..."
128,00:08:39.50,00:08:39.50,"In Vietnam, there's this monk. He lived for many years on"
129,00:08:43.33,00:08:43.33,coconut only. >> I have a feeling you are
130,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,gonna be telling a lot of stories tonight.
131,00:08:48.79,00:08:48.79,">> Um, I gotta say, just for me, I'm just.. the person I'm having"
132,00:08:52.08,00:08:52.08,the most difficulty with is Cao Boi because I sense a-a little
133,00:08:55.58,00:08:55.58,bit of a schism there. I think there's some degree of a
134,00:08:58.00,00:08:58.00,generational gap. >> My biggest concern being an
135,00:09:05.08,00:09:05.08,all-Asian tribe is I've never been accepted by the Asian
136,00:09:07.79,00:09:07.79,community. Take one look at me.
137,00:09:11.04,00:09:11.04,I don't look educated. I don't fit the stereotype:
138,00:09:15.42,00:09:15.42,"hard working, Mr. Engineer with jacket, suit and tie, drive nice"
139,00:09:18.75,00:09:18.75,cars. I just don't fit the stereotype.
140,00:09:22.67,00:09:22.67,I belong in a hippie community instead.
141,00:09:25.38,00:09:25.38,It's a very dangerous position for me to be in.
142,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,>> The accommodations are lovely.
143,00:09:34.83,00:09:34.83,>> Here we are. >> Yeah-hoo!
144,00:09:37.04,00:09:37.04,>> I guess this is where we're going to make our shelter.
145,00:09:38.75,00:09:38.75,">> Come on, let's put our hands together."
146,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,">> We made it, and we will continue to make it."
147,00:09:42.00,00:09:42.00,">> Day one, to the end. >> To the final end."
148,00:09:45.25,00:09:45.25,>> Absolutely. >> 'Cause y'all know what this
149,00:09:46.54,00:09:46.54,"is about, right? >> Yeah, we do, sir!"
150,00:09:48.46,00:09:48.46,">> Represent, represent, represent, represent."
151,00:09:51.50,00:09:51.50,">> Whoo, got a new chant! >> That's what I'm talking"
152,00:09:53.33,00:09:53.33,about! >> I believe we all feel the
153,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,"pressure to represent, and that just means it's-it's just being"
154,00:10:00.75,00:10:00.75,"able to represent us, our people, the African American"
155,00:10:03.33,00:10:03.33,culture. >> Let's get firewood.
156,00:10:05.54,00:10:05.54,"One person get firewood, one person get bamboo, and the"
157,00:10:07.92,00:10:07.92,"other person gets, uh, palms. >> Okay."
158,00:10:10.92,00:10:10.92,">> Here, I don't need this. I'll-I'll get the palms."
159,00:10:12.42,00:10:12.42,"It makes me feel like, because we are divided by race, now we"
160,00:10:16.04,00:10:16.04,"have to step up to the plate and show that, yes, black people"
161,00:10:20.21,00:10:20.21,"do swim. Yes, black people do know how"
162,00:10:22.38,00:10:22.38,to get on a boat and paddle. I mean... (laughs)
163,00:10:25.25,00:10:25.25,we don't just run track. >> We almost got us a house.
164,00:10:33.12,00:10:33.12,">> Yes, honey. >> Exactly."
165,00:10:35.96,00:10:35.96,>> That's some nasty hair right there.
166,00:10:38.75,00:10:38.75,">> With our group, it has nothing to do with race."
167,00:10:42.00,00:10:42.00,We are just a bunch of city kids.
168,00:10:43.83,00:10:43.83,This couldn't cut cotton. We're gonna have to sharpen it.
169,00:10:47.62,00:10:47.62,It's not that we are black. We're just city slickers thrown
170,00:10:51.46,00:10:51.46,"into the bareness of life. Lay... I would lay one here, lay"
171,00:10:55.04,00:10:55.04,"one here, lay one here, and just put palms over it and call it a"
172,00:10:58.04,00:10:58.04,"night. That's what I would do, but,"
173,00:11:00.21,00:11:00.21,it's up to y'all. >> We just got here.
174,00:11:04.17,00:11:04.17,We're trying to assemble shelter.
175,00:11:06.42,00:11:06.42,"It's going all right. But, you know, black people"
176,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,"don't like to be told what to do, and we have a bunch of"
177,00:11:13.25,00:11:13.25,"headstrong people around here, me being one of them, I will"
178,00:11:16.08,00:11:16.08,say. >> Uh-uh.
179,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,>> 'Cause what happens is we have...
180,00:11:19.21,00:11:19.21,">> I will not... No, this is not going to work."
181,00:11:21.50,00:11:21.50,">> We got that part, so we want to..."
182,00:11:23.29,00:11:23.29,"What, you want to go like this? >> Yeah."
183,00:11:26.17,00:11:26.17,">> I think... >> My vision, well..."
184,00:11:28.25,00:11:28.25,I had a dream! (laughter)
185,00:11:30.58,00:11:30.58,">> Wake up! >> ""Sekou"" means leader"
186,00:11:33.17,00:11:33.17,"and warrior-- I do bring some leadership, and I've been able"
187,00:11:36.17,00:11:36.17,to pull this group's attention into the focus of what needs
188,00:11:38.71,00:11:38.71,"to be done, and they've been able to respond."
189,00:11:42.17,00:11:42.17,"Let's get some palms up, girls. I wanted us to stay focused for"
190,00:11:46.79,00:11:46.79,"what we had to do, and I think I accomplished that."
191,00:11:49.54,00:11:49.54,"I'm liking this already. It may have set a tone, too, and"
192,00:11:52.58,00:11:52.58,"if it did, I hope it, you know, was positive for them as much as"
193,00:11:56.25,00:11:56.25,it was for me. >> Pretty impressive.
194,00:11:58.96,00:11:58.96,>> This is low-income housing. (laughter)
195,00:12:17.54,00:12:17.54,>> How you doing back there? >> I'm doing great.
196,00:12:19.67,00:12:19.67,>> Okay. >> The tribes were obviously
197,00:12:23.42,00:12:23.42,"divided by ethnicity, but it doesn't matter to me if it's"
198,00:12:26.71,00:12:26.71,"just all other white people or-or, uh, any other type of..."
199,00:12:29.96,00:12:29.96,of race. The issue is what kind of people
200,00:12:33.12,00:12:33.12,"you have in your tribe, and what kind of personalities, and how"
201,00:12:35.71,00:12:35.71,you get along with them. >> Whoo-hoo!
202,00:12:38.08,00:12:38.08,>> Here we are. >> Do we anchor this thing?
203,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,It is going to be a true social experiment.
204,00:12:43.83,00:12:43.83,"It's going to be fascinating to see how it plays out, but I"
205,00:12:46.75,00:12:46.75,don't believe that just because these groups have the cultural
206,00:12:49.79,00:12:49.79,similarities that that will make them more specifically
207,00:12:52.83,00:12:52.83,cohesive. This is Survivor.

210,00:13:00.21,00:13:00.21,point. >> Great haul!
211,00:13:02.58,00:13:02.58,>> Whoo. >> All right.
212,00:13:04.42,00:13:04.42,">> As soon as we got to the island, we were just pulling it"

215,00:13:14.92,00:13:14.92,slings and two chickens. (clucking)
216,00:13:18.21,00:13:18.21,>> Oh. (giggling)
217,00:13:20.25,00:13:20.25,">> Hey, make sure those chickens aren't going to get out."
218,00:13:22.33,00:13:22.33,">> Yeah, but... >> I did grab a chicken."
219,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,The chicken was belonging to the green team.
220,00:13:26.88,00:13:26.88,I didn't even know. I saw a chicken.
221,00:13:29.08,00:13:29.08,"I grabbed the chicken, 'cause the chicken was free."
222,00:13:31.50,00:13:31.50,">> Y'all kicked ass today. >> Yeah, can we just say that"
223,00:13:34.62,00:13:34.62,for one second? >> I think we should have a
224,00:13:36.92,00:13:36.92,coconut and toast to our victory.
225,00:13:39.25,00:13:39.25,>> Let's do that. To us all.
226,00:13:41.08,00:13:41.08,>> Hey! >> Cheers!
227,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,>> How cool is this? >> To the whiteys!
228,00:13:44.83,00:13:44.83,">> The whiteys! >> I was going to say Rarotonga,"
229,00:13:47.25,00:13:47.25,"but, I mean... >> We are the Caucasian group."
230,00:13:52.04,00:13:52.04,"We've got, like, a jock, and then we've got the sorority"

236,00:14:11.92,00:14:11.92,That's easy. >> My friend Flicka.
237,00:14:14.04,00:14:14.04,I've never seen that flick. (screaming)
238,00:14:16.88,00:14:16.88,>> (gasps): No! Oh. (clucking)
239,00:14:20.12,00:14:20.12,(screaming) >> No! Flicka!
240,00:14:23.88,00:14:23.88,Why did you have to do it?! >> I am so sorry.
241,00:14:28.08,00:14:28.08,">> I got a chicken in here. Guys, come around here."
242,00:14:30.67,00:14:30.67,">> Where, where, where? >> Okay, okay."
243,00:14:32.42,00:14:32.42,Surround this chicken. >> All right...
244,00:14:34.42,00:14:34.42,">> There's a chicken right here. Okay, wait, wait, don't scare,"
245,00:14:37.04,00:14:37.04,"don't scare, don't scare. >> Did you get him?"
246,00:14:39.25,00:14:39.25,">> No, he moved too fast. >> Oh."
247,00:14:41.96,00:14:41.96,>> I went to pick up the... and-and they ran out.
248,00:14:46.25,00:14:46.25,I can't even believe it. >> Oh!
249,00:14:49.33,00:14:49.33,>> One-second mistake cost us the chickens.
250,00:14:52.21,00:14:52.21,The woods ate the chickens. They're in there.
251,00:14:54.38,00:14:54.38,And now I hear them. I scream at them.
252,00:14:56.71,00:14:56.71,(crowing) So I'm not happy right now with
253,00:14:59.67,00:14:59.67,"Flicka. I can forgive her, right?"
254,00:15:01.83,00:15:01.83,"But I-I don't have to forgive her, 'cause she screwed up my"
255,00:15:04.50,00:15:04.50,chickens. >> Ah!
256,00:15:19.71,00:15:19.71,>> You found it? (whooping)
257,00:15:21.58,00:15:21.58,>> Yeah? (both laughing and whooping)
258,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,">> That's something very nice. >> Oh, yeah."
259,00:15:35.21,00:15:35.21,">> Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! >> Oh, good going, mama."
260,00:15:37.79,00:15:37.79,"Oh, my God. >> Parasitic paradise."

262,00:15:44.50,00:15:44.50,"but a lot of water is in there, so when we have some fire to"
263,00:15:49.46,00:15:49.46,"boil the water that we have, no one has to worry about"
264,00:15:52.38,00:15:52.38,getting dehydrated. >> \xe2\x99\xaa We got our water! \xe2\x99\xaa
265,00:15:54.71,00:15:54.71,(humming) >> Rebecca is cool.
266,00:15:56.92,00:15:56.92,"Rebecca is really cool. We're both from New York, so"
267,00:15:59.38,00:15:59.38,that already has a little immediate sense of familiarity.
268,00:16:03.29,00:16:03.29,"She's just smart, athletic. You know, I feel like we can"
269,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,"work really well together. >> All right, you got it,"
270,00:16:10.62,00:16:10.62,"Rebecca. >> There we go, babe."
271,00:16:12.79,00:16:12.79,>> I feel that Rebecca and Sundra are much closer than I
272,00:16:15.29,00:16:15.29,could be to either of them. >> I got water! I got water.
273,00:16:20.58,00:16:20.58,>> I'm so proud of you. >> They go off together a lot.
274,00:16:23.21,00:16:23.21,"They're always talking, just the two of them, so that's just"
275,00:16:26.25,00:16:26.25,"something that I'm watching. I'm keeping my eyes on it,"
276,00:16:29.38,00:16:29.38,keeping the pulse on it. >> Did y'all bring back some
277,00:16:32.04,00:16:32.04,"water? >> No, 'cause we don't have"
278,00:16:34.25,00:16:34.25,any... >> We have no fire to boil.
279,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,>> Okay... >> We will work on fire.
280,00:16:38.21,00:16:38.21,We're not going to give up. >> Okay.
281,00:16:40.17,00:16:40.17,>> Okay? And I'm going to focus my energy right into the wood.
282,00:16:45.08,00:16:45.08,>> Oxygen... >> Yeah.
283,00:16:47.08,00:16:47.08,"(sighs) >> Okay, everybody focus, okay?"
284,00:16:49.75,00:16:49.75,>> Who's holding the stick? >> We're making fire.
285,00:16:51.71,00:16:51.71,>> I got the stick. >> Focus on what we're doing.
286,00:16:55.21,00:16:55.21,>> Are we smoking? >> No.
287,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,">> Come on! >> Oh, yes!"
288,00:16:59.12,00:16:59.12,>> Ooh. >> I need a break.
289,00:17:00.92,00:17:00.92,>> All right. >> You want to do it?
290,00:17:02.92,00:17:02.92,>> Yes. >> It's all you.
291,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,">> Building houses, making fire, in the name of the Lord..."
292,00:17:06.96,00:17:06.96,">> Stay cool. >> He likes to take long breaks,"
293,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,and we're... It's... We've got too much to do.
294,00:17:13.79,00:17:13.79,"I understand we're all low on fuel right now, but he is not"
295,00:17:17.42,00:17:17.42,"one to stay focused at all. You want something, right?"
296,00:17:23.42,00:17:23.42,Sometimes you just have to do it yourself.
297,00:17:28.96,00:17:28.96,"(sighs) >> It's just very frustrating,"
298,00:17:32.21,00:17:32.21,"but I'm not going to say anything more to him right now,"
299,00:17:35.17,00:17:35.17,'cause I'm in a state of pisstation.
300,00:17:37.12,00:17:37.12,(laughs) >> Can I get a lunch break?
301,00:17:39.96,00:17:39.96,(laughter) >> It's getting cold out here.
302,00:17:51.46,00:17:51.46,>> Pity the kid... >> Is anybody else getting cold?
303,00:17:53.33,00:17:53.33,>> I'm freaky cold. >> Y'all want to go back?
304,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,>> Yeah. >> Should we go snuggle at home?
305,00:17:57.17,00:17:57.17,>> Should we try it? >> Can we just sleep closer?
306,00:17:59.25,00:17:59.25,"I'm so cold. I get really cold at night, and"
307,00:18:03.04,00:18:03.04,so I've been sleeping next to Adam.
308,00:18:05.75,00:18:05.75,"I mean, he's the biggest guy out here, and he's a good wind"
309,00:18:08.50,00:18:08.50,"blocker. Okay, all right, all right,"
310,00:18:11.25,00:18:11.25,we're all spooning the same way. This is going to work.
311,00:18:16.92,00:18:16.92,(laughter) >> We need to all slide in.
312,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,It's cold. >> Yeah. Slide this way.

314,00:18:26.21,00:18:26.21,"face. You know, he's fit."
315,00:18:28.04,00:18:28.04,"I mean, of course, Adam's a good-looking guy."
316,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,>> I'm on fire. >> I'm... I'm dry.
317,00:18:34.33,00:18:34.33,>> I know you're dry right now. >> It does make the island a
318,00:18:37.25,00:18:37.25,little more bearable to have a couple of good-looking girls.
319,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,Great-looking girls. I'm attracted to Candice a lot.
320,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,>> It doesn't matter. It's still warm.
321,00:18:45.29,00:18:45.29,>> Really? >> Yeah.
322,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,The body heat is the best thing by far.

326,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,I don't know. Romance is in the air.
327,00:19:09.71,00:19:09.71,">> Where's the headache? >> Like, right here."
328,00:19:12.33,00:19:12.33,"It's from being seasick all day. >> Okay, sit down."
329,00:19:15.21,00:19:15.21,Sit down. Sit on... Brad's problem was he didn't 
330,00:19:19.42,00:19:19.42,"have the normal headache. In Vietnamese, we call it a ""bad"

333,00:19:27.62,00:19:27.62,"of you-- this bad wind. It's not a regular migraine,"
334,00:19:35.04,00:19:35.04,on one side or in the back. It's usually a sinus headache
335,00:19:38.58,00:19:38.58,"near the front, and that's an indicator of the bad wind."
336,00:19:41.62,00:19:41.62,You got it. You got a touch of bad wind.
337,00:19:44.29,00:19:44.29,"It's not real bad, but it is not great."
338,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,There. You'll feel better now.

341,00:19:53.88,00:19:53.88,That's called the indicator. I just pulled it out of you.
342,00:19:56.62,00:19:56.62,That's how bad you have it in you.
343,00:19:58.21,00:19:58.21,>> It's not that bad. >> No.
344,00:19:59.71,00:19:59.71,"The I put an indicator here. By pulling it out, I can see how"
345,00:20:02.38,00:20:02.38,"bad he has it. I told him, when it's completely"
346,00:20:04.92,00:20:04.92,"gone, your body will be fully healed."
347,00:20:08.12,00:20:08.12,>> What the hell happened to you?
348,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,>> He put his hands all over... >> What?
349,00:20:14.21,00:20:14.21,And he did that to your face? >> Yeah.
350,00:20:16.79,00:20:16.79,>> It looks like it's burned! >> The others-- the Asian
351,00:20:20.25,00:20:20.25,Americans-- they were born in America.
352,00:20:21.96,00:20:21.96,They've lost touch. They were not born in the old

354,00:20:27.04,00:20:27.04,"antibiotics, so they have to figure out other ways to do to"

356,00:20:33.08,00:20:33.08,">> Yeah. I had a headache, and he got"
357,00:20:35.25,00:20:35.25,"rid of it, actually. >> He hit you on the forehead?"
358,00:20:38.25,00:20:38.25,">> He was, like, squeezing my forehead."
359,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,I will be truthfully honest with you.
360,00:20:42.46,00:20:42.46,I did have a headache. I don't have a headache anymore.
361,00:20:45.33,00:20:45.33,But I do have a red dot on my forehead.

370,00:21:05.25,00:21:05.25,>> When you're completely healed.

387,00:22:14.17,00:22:14.17,and next thing I see is someone else from another team running
388,00:22:17.46,00:22:17.46,around with my chicken. (laughter)

401,00:22:49.29,00:22:49.29,retrieve fire in the form of a torch.
402,00:22:52.12,00:22:52.12,"When you get back to shore, you will take those seven braces,"

504,00:29:43.08,00:29:43.08,challenge. I showed you the note
505,00:29:45.21,00:29:45.21,beforehand. I'll now read it.
506,00:29:47.67,00:29:47.67,"""The losing tribe will choose one person from any of the"
507,00:29:51.67,00:29:51.67,"""other three tribes to go to Exile Island."""

512,00:30:03.88,00:30:03.88,right now and spend two nights on Exile Island.
513,00:30:06.29,00:30:06.29,It is a big disadvantage to be separated from your tribe this
514,00:30:09.21,00:30:09.21,early in the game. Exile Island is no picnic.
515,00:30:13.46,00:30:13.46,There is one bag of water out there.
516,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,"You will also have a machete, a flint and a pot."

518,00:30:23.29,00:30:23.29,the island is an immunity idol. That will protect you at Tribal
519,00:30:27.12,00:30:27.12,Council. It's good up through the final
520,00:30:30.08,00:30:30.08,"four. When somebody finds it, you can"
521,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,keep that information to yourself.
522,00:30:35.33,00:30:35.33,You can share it with whoever you want.
523,00:30:37.04,00:30:37.04,You can even assign that immunity and give it to
524,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,somebody else. Each time somebody is sent to
525,00:30:41.29,00:30:41.29,"Exile Island, you will get a clue as to the whereabouts of"
526,00:30:44.38,00:30:44.38,"the idol. Hiki, who is it going to be?"
527,00:30:46.62,00:30:46.62,>> Let's talk this over. We gotta look at these guys.
528,00:30:50.25,00:30:50.25,We got to take... We want to...
529,00:30:59.42,00:30:59.42,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: All right.

531,00:31:03.08,00:31:03.08,it was interesting to note that the two guys came out here and
532,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,"made the decision, and the women stayed back."
533,00:31:08.08,00:31:08.08,>> They seemed like they had taken control over it.
534,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,>> PROBST: Okay. Who's going to Exile Island?
535,00:31:16.08,00:31:16.08,">> We don't know his name, but we can point him out to you."
536,00:31:19.29,00:31:19.29,">> We say karma is a bizzle, so my chicken man over here."
537,00:31:22.25,00:31:22.25,">> PROBST: Jonathan, you're going to Exile Island."

540,00:31:33.88,00:31:33.88,"the whereabouts of the idol. Okay, Hiki, sadly, one of the"
541,00:31:47.21,00:31:47.21,five of you will be the first person voted out of this game.
542,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,I'll see you guys at Tribal Council.
543,00:31:51.79,00:31:51.79,Everybody can head back to their camps.
544,00:32:11.42,00:32:11.42,>> I think it was because I took the Asian guy's chicken that
545,00:32:15.46,00:32:15.46,the African-American guys chose me.
546,00:32:16.96,00:32:16.96,That's all they said. I was so shocked by what
547,00:32:20.17,00:32:20.17,"happened, I didn't even have a comeback."
548,00:32:23.83,00:32:23.83,"""To make a top grade, stand in a line."

551,00:32:36.54,00:32:36.54,mean to make the top grade was an A or an A-plus.
552,00:32:42.42,00:32:42.42,So I started digging. The idol!
553,00:32:44.75,00:32:44.75,"Made sense to me, but I just haven't found it yet."
554,00:32:50.67,00:32:50.67,"I'm cold, miserable, shivering, missing my wife and kids."
555,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,(moans) Exile Island's really terrible.
556,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,>> You guys work on the fire. We'll continue working on the
557,00:33:09.29,00:33:09.29,bedding. >> Yeah.

561,00:33:23.25,00:33:23.25,I guess we just... >> Yeah. The game begins.
562,00:33:31.88,00:33:31.88,">> Yep. >> If they're in threes,"
563,00:33:34.67,00:33:34.67,"they're going to be vote, trying to vote one of, one of us off."
564,00:33:37.58,00:33:37.58,>> They're stupid if they do that.
565,00:33:39.38,00:33:39.38,>> They're stupid! >> So we gotta pull one of the 
566,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,"women. I don't know, you know, you"
567,00:33:43.12,00:33:43.12,"never know, though. These sisters could think,"
568,00:33:45.04,00:33:45.04,"""Yeah, we don't need no men, we can do it all ourselves."""
569,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,>> It's gonna be an interesting dynamic now.
570,00:33:57.25,00:33:57.25,>> I already feel the tension. >> Yes.
571,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,>> The ladies and I are thinking that Sekou might be
572,00:34:03.21,00:34:03.21,the right person to vote out at this time because we've had a
573,00:34:06.71,00:34:06.71,"hard time kind of establishing leadership, and no one's been"
574,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,"working in unison, and we think that he plays a major role in"
575,00:34:13.04,00:34:13.04,"that, and it might be easier for us to work as a team without"
576,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,him. >> They may think that they can
577,00:34:18.83,00:34:18.83,"get away with losing me or you, or me."
578,00:34:22.50,00:34:22.50,It ain't going to work. >> I know.
579,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,">> They can't even make fire. They can't even build a hut,"
580,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,dude. I'm telling you.
581,00:34:29.00,00:34:29.00,>> Sundra... >> And Becca.
582,00:34:30.12,00:34:30.12,and Becca are tight. >> Right. Right.
583,00:34:32.08,00:34:32.08,>> They're not gonna turn on one another.
584,00:34:33.50,00:34:33.50,I got that sense. >> I got that.
585,00:34:34.96,00:34:34.96,>> So... >> Right.
586,00:34:40.54,00:34:40.54,We know that it's gonna eventually come down to a
587,00:34:43.21,00:34:43.21,woman-men thing. So... My plan and Nate's plan was to
588,00:34:46.92,00:34:46.92,"make an ally of Stephannie. If you all lose me tonight, and"
589,00:34:54.62,00:34:54.62,"y'all lose another competition, and ultimately y'all will lose"
590,00:34:57.42,00:34:57.42,"Nathan, and there's just three girls..."
591,00:34:59.96,00:34:59.96,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...you're out.
592,00:35:01.88,00:35:01.88,>> Why do you say that? >> Because them two are tight.
593,00:35:05.25,00:35:05.25,Because them two are like peas in a pod.
594,00:35:08.71,00:35:08.71,You have to break that up. >> Mm-hmm.
595,00:35:11.12,00:35:11.12,>> Sekou actually came to me trying to persuade me to align
596,00:35:16.00,00:35:16.00,myself with him and Nate and to vote Sundra out.
597,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,">> We gotta have you, okay? Now, do you want to make it in a"
598,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,world with a bunch of people who got an alliance based on
599,00:35:26.08,00:35:26.08,"where they're from, or somebody that knows how to survive in"
600,00:35:28.92,00:35:28.92,this environment? Or that can bring on some fire?
601,00:35:32.25,00:35:32.25,">> We don't have any fire yet, though."
602,00:35:34.12,00:35:34.12,>> That's all right. When I build a fire... (sighs)
603,00:35:37.54,00:35:37.54,"y'all better keep it going, because if y'all boot me out,"
604,00:35:40.29,00:35:40.29,there ain't gonna be no more fire.
605,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,This ain't a glamour walk. This is about survival.
606,00:35:45.62,00:35:45.62,This is the real thing about getting down.
607,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,Do you feel what I'm saying? >> I do.
608,00:35:49.88,00:35:49.88,">> Okay? >> I know that my vote is, is a"
609,00:35:52.54,00:35:52.54,"swing vote. You know, you've got Nate and"
610,00:35:55.29,00:35:55.29,"Sekou, you have the men on one side, you've got Sundra and"
611,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,"you've got Rebecca, the women, on the other side."
612,00:36:02.62,00:36:02.62,They're very close. The guys are very close.
613,00:36:04.71,00:36:04.71,So of course I'm the swing vote. >> Okay?
614,00:36:17.71,00:36:17.71,>> Mm-hmm. >> All right.
615,00:36:18.58,00:36:18.58,>> All right. >> We need everybody.
616,00:36:21.08,00:36:21.08,So it's gonna be sad to say good-bye to somebody tonight.
617,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,It's gonna be a little difficult.
618,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
619,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch.
620,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,Approach the flame and get fire. This is part of the ritual of
621,00:37:09.25,00:37:09.25,"Tribal Council, because in this game, fire represents your life."
622,00:37:17.42,00:37:17.42,"As long as you have fire, you're in the game."
623,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
624,00:37:21.29,00:37:21.29,"Take a seat. Well, welcome to your first"
625,00:37:30.04,00:37:30.04,"Tribal Council. It goes without saying, not the"
626,00:37:32.71,00:37:32.71,"place you wanted to be. So, catch me up."
627,00:37:35.12,00:37:35.12,"Rebecca, did anybody step up right away as a leader?"
628,00:37:38.12,00:37:38.12,>> Yes. Sekou definitely stepped up as a leader and
629,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"tried to help structurally sound, uh, um, shelter for us."
630,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,He seemed at the time to know the best and the quickest way to
631,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"possibly get it together. >> PROBST: Sekou, did you have a"
632,00:37:50.58,00:37:50.58,"plan to step up as a leader, or did you look at the tribe and"
633,00:37:53.25,00:37:53.25,"say, ""I think I'm probably the best guy for the job""?"
634,00:37:55.54,00:37:55.54,>> I just took whatever I knew and started putting that into
635,00:37:58.83,00:37:58.83,"effect, and I think everybody just gravitated towards that."
636,00:38:02.29,00:38:02.29,"I didn't say, ""Okay, I'm running things."""
637,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,"I think it kind of ended up that way, but we work together"
638,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,"well. >> PROBST: So, Nate, you're"
639,00:38:10.29,00:38:10.29,starting to get to know everybody.
640,00:38:11.92,00:38:11.92,What's the feeling of this tribe?
641,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,>> We have beautiful spirit. We are like a little family.
642,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,"Regardless of what happens tonight, this crew right here, I"
643,00:38:21.83,00:38:21.83,"mean, they're, they're real beautiful people."
644,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,>> PROBST: How does tribes divided ethnically change the
645,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,game? Or does it?
646,00:38:29.88,00:38:29.88,"(laughter) >> Yeah, it does."
647,00:38:31.54,00:38:31.54,>> PROBST: Why is it so funny? >> Because it is!
648,00:38:33.75,00:38:33.75,(laughter) I don't know.
649,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"It's just something you wouldn't expect, you know. It's like--"
650,00:38:38.33,00:38:38.33,"""Okay, we're gonna have to represent for our people"
651,00:38:40.29,00:38:40.29,"because, you know, we're put under the light like that, so"
652,00:38:43.21,00:38:43.21,"let's see what we can do, you know?"
653,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,">> PROBST: So, Sundra, with only five people, the divisions and"
654,00:38:49.12,00:38:49.12,how people pair up becomes very important.
655,00:38:51.21,00:38:51.21,"What did you notice? >> I noticed right off the bat,"
656,00:38:54.04,00:38:54.04,"well, Rebecca and I have kind of bonded."
657,00:38:57.04,00:38:57.04,And then I realized that the two guys had bonded.
658,00:38:59.83,00:38:59.83,"And of course, you know, Stephannie was apart."
659,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,"It wasn't like she was excluded, but I think we kind of sensed"
660,00:39:05.38,00:39:05.38,"each other's vibe already. >> PROBST: So, Stephannie, there"
661,00:39:08.62,00:39:08.62,"are two pairs that are bonded, and you're not a part of either"
662,00:39:11.08,00:39:11.08,"one of those groups? >> Naturally, women are going"
663,00:39:13.62,00:39:13.62,to stick together. Um... And the men will naturally bond
664,00:39:17.00,00:39:17.00,together. That's just natural.
665,00:39:18.08,00:39:18.08,"But I'm the odd man out. That's kind of strange, and I"
666,00:39:21.92,00:39:21.92,"kind of wondered about that, but we're all still together."
667,00:39:25.12,00:39:25.12,">> PROBST: Rebecca, only three days."
668,00:39:27.79,00:39:27.79,Somebody's going home tonight. So what do you do in terms of
669,00:39:31.12,00:39:31.12,your vote? What are you looking at in this
670,00:39:33.21,00:39:33.21,tribe? >> You look at where we're weak
671,00:39:35.92,00:39:35.92,"and what we did wrong over the last three days, and hope that"
672,00:39:41.50,00:39:41.50,"in voting, that will somehow be corrected."
673,00:39:45.25,00:39:45.25,">> PROBST: Well, unfortunately one of the five of you will"
674,00:39:48.00,00:39:48.00,have the distinction of being the first person voted out.
675,00:39:51.21,00:39:51.21,"It is time to vote. Sekou, you're up."
676,00:40:08.33,00:40:08.33,">> You are our weakest, weakest link."
677,00:40:24.83,00:40:24.83,">> You are a sweet, sweet man. We just thought this was the"
678,00:40:29.00,00:40:29.00,right move for right now. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
679,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
680,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,decision is final. The person voted out will be
681,00:41:18.33,00:41:18.33,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
682,00:41:20.58,00:41:20.58,I'll read the votes. First vote--
683,00:41:25.25,00:41:25.25,Sundra. Sekou.
684,00:41:30.83,00:41:30.83,"One vote Sundra, one vote Sekou. Sundra."
685,00:41:36.04,00:41:36.04,"That's two votes Sundra, one vote Sekou."
686,00:41:41.83,00:41:41.83,"Sekou. We're tied, two votes Sekou,"
687,00:41:44.50,00:41:44.50,"two votes Sundra, one vote left. First person voted out of"
688,00:41:51.92,00:41:51.92,Survivor: Cook Islands... Sekou.
689,00:41:58.83,00:41:58.83,"You need to bring me your torch. Sekou, the tribe has spoken."
690,00:42:12.42,00:42:12.42,It's time for you to go. If what you said tonight is
691,00:42:23.83,00:42:23.83,"true and you just voted out your weakest link, then you"
692,00:42:27.04,00:42:27.04,"should go back to camp a stronger, more organized tribe."
693,00:42:30.25,00:42:30.25,"Good news is, because you've been to Tribal Council, you now"
694,00:42:33.04,00:42:33.04,have fire. Grab your torches.
695,00:42:36.21,00:42:36.21,(laughter) Head on back to camp.

710,00:43:23.08,00:43:23.08,guidance and I'm sure that I had a real strong effect with
711,00:43:26.25,00:43:26.25,my tribe. I have no doubt about that.
712,00:43:28.46,00:43:28.46,They saw that I was a real strong leader.
713,00:43:31.12,00:43:31.12,"Well, guess what? They're going to be a really"
