6,00:00:21.83,00:00:21.83,>> Pick up that!>> JEFF: The fans struggled on

9,00:00:38.46,00:00:38.46,"the favorites relied onexperience, but experience"
10,00:00:41.25,00:00:41.25,wasn't enough.The first immunity challenge is

17,00:01:05.96,00:01:05.96,>> We need a fifth.>> I say Fairplay.
18,00:01:08.25,00:01:08.25,>> We need Fairplay to make astrong alliance.
19,00:01:11.88,00:01:11.88,>> JEFF: But Fairplay made asurprising revelation to his
20,00:01:13.83,00:01:13.83,tribe.>> JEFF: Not everyone was
21,00:01:22.88,00:01:22.88,convinced he was telling thetruth.
22,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,">> If I know Jonny Fairplay, heis going to pull something out"

25,00:01:33.42,00:01:33.42,"entire tribe wrote down hisname, and severed ties with one"
26,00:01:36.33,00:01:36.33,of the most infamous players toplay the game.
27,00:01:40.12,00:01:40.12,"Jonny Fairplay, the tribe hasspoken."

30,00:02:02.25,00:02:02.25,hands.>> I know.
31,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,"How awesome is that?>> Yes, guys, we lost Fairplay,"
32,00:02:06.79,00:02:06.79,but we did gain a fish.Maybe that's a good omen.
33,00:02:12.67,00:02:12.67,>> How awesome is it we cameback and now we're eating fish?
34,00:02:15.54,00:02:15.54,>> I know.A late-night snack.
35,00:02:18.42,00:02:18.42,">> Well, we had tribal counciltonight, and Jonny Fairplay had"
36,00:02:21.17,00:02:21.17,asked us to vote him off.And I kept thinking something
37,00:02:25.33,00:02:25.33,"was going to change, somethingwas gone going to happen,"
38,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,something terrible-- that I wasgoing to be the one going home
39,00:02:29.42,00:02:29.42,first.But we took him seriously and we
40,00:02:31.46,00:02:31.46,honored his request.>> There was just too much going
41,00:02:34.29,00:02:34.29,"on for him, which is weird,because he seemed to be holding"
42,00:02:37.42,00:02:37.42,it together.I was not pleased when Jonny
43,00:02:42.00,00:02:42.00,"pulled this, because it screwedup my plans."
44,00:02:44.92,00:02:44.92,But you know what?Everybody knows that if we can
45,00:02:47.92,00:02:47.92,"continue to do what we're doing,we should be able to win."
46,00:02:50.25,00:02:50.25,">> I'll tell you what, it isdelicious."
47,00:02:53.58,00:02:53.58,"I mean, I figure that ifeveryone had been out here for"
48,00:02:55.92,00:02:55.92,"30, 33, 39 days, something likethat, times nine, that's"
49,00:02:59.04,00:02:59.04,basically a year's worth ofexperience.
50,00:03:01.83,00:03:01.83,We're just feeling confidentthat we can go in there and beat
51,00:03:03.79,00:03:03.79,these guys at almost anychallenge.

63,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,"going to ignite immediately.>> Like, boom!"

65,00:05:12.75,00:05:12.75,>> Keep blowing.Blow more.

70,00:05:54.25,00:05:54.25,Do we know?Let's go find out.
71,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,>> The boys are still back theretrying to start a fire.
72,00:06:00.12,00:06:00.12,"They're all chopping away, butwe've got nothing!"
73,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,"Number one priority for me isshelter, because pretty much"
74,00:06:06.54,00:06:06.54,every night it rains.So let's go and let's do it.
75,00:06:09.62,00:06:09.62,What is the problem?I don't understand.
76,00:06:12.62,00:06:12.62,>> Why is everybody talking allthe time and not working?
77,00:06:15.92,00:06:15.92,">> Oh, this will be the worstnight in the history of our"

79,00:06:21.12,00:06:21.12,Nothing.>> Yeah.
80,00:06:23.79,00:06:23.79,>> Then let's all... can we allget in on it and start humping
81,00:06:26.17,00:06:26.17,"it?>> No, they're not going to help"
82,00:06:29.33,00:06:29.33,build a shelter.They're going to go dig for
83,00:06:31.25,00:06:31.25,wood.>> I just spent a half hour
84,00:06:40.25,00:06:40.25,trying to do fire!All you do is run your mouth.
85,00:06:45.21,00:06:45.21,">> And we have not had to go totribal council yet, and there's"
86,00:06:48.54,00:06:48.54,"drama!>> We can clean out that cave,"
87,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,"shush it out with some palmfronds, lay some down, and we"
88,00:06:59.21,00:06:59.21,"can sleep clean and dry tonight.See, they're already cleaning it"
89,00:07:02.71,00:07:02.71,"out.Oh, those rat bastards."
90,00:07:05.00,00:07:05.00,>> Yeah.>> This is exactly what we were
91,00:07:06.83,00:07:06.83,getting ready to do.>> We were going to come and
92,00:07:08.42,00:07:08.42,"clean it out and put some palmfronds down, and that was going"
93,00:07:10.08,00:07:10.08,"to be home tonight.>> No, this is my habitat"
94,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"tonight.>> Tracy, Kathy, and Chet, I"
95,00:07:19.12,00:07:19.12,don't think they accomplished asingle productive thing all day
96,00:07:22.58,00:07:22.58,long.And I just don't even want to be
97,00:07:24.62,00:07:24.62,"around them, so I told themstraight up, I was like, ""I"
98,00:07:27.17,00:07:27.17,"don't want you sleeping in thecave."""
99,00:07:29.33,00:07:29.33,">> I'm not going to fight withthese kids, you know?"
100,00:07:31.92,00:07:31.92,"I mean, they hate us.Come on."
101,00:07:37.12,00:07:37.12,">> Tracy, Chet, and myself havepretty much been shunned by the"
102,00:07:40.71,00:07:40.71,other people.And you can't fight seven
103,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,against three.It just makes you relive things
104,00:07:46.67,00:07:46.67,"in your life-- high school,whatever-- when you didn't fit"
105,00:07:49.12,00:07:49.12,in and you were kind of outcast.It just kind of brings it all
106,00:07:51.21,00:07:51.21,"back.>> Yeah, let's do that."
107,00:07:57.92,00:07:57.92,"Let's grab it.>> Oh, they took it."
108,00:08:02.21,00:08:02.21,">> They just took it.>> Okay, okay."
109,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,>> Tell me we're not divided.>> We were quite disorganized in
110,00:08:27.88,00:08:27.88,"the last challenge, so we'regoing to try to do a little"
111,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,better today.And we're hoping that the fans
112,00:08:33.04,00:08:33.04,"have slept poorly and are stillway behind us on the camp curve,"
113,00:08:37.96,00:08:37.96,"because we're doing great, Imean, honestly."
114,00:08:52.58,00:08:52.58,>> And we thought this one wasbig.
115,00:08:54.62,00:08:54.62,>> Yeah.>> Right?
116,00:08:56.88,00:08:56.88,>> Yeah.I'm starting to become... I'm
117,00:09:00.42,00:09:00.42,starting to become reallyattracted to Amanda.
118,00:09:03.08,00:09:03.08,"She is so cute.I mean, she's beautiful, and"
119,00:09:05.71,00:09:05.71,"it's like... oh, we've just gotto stay apart as long as"
120,00:09:11.08,00:09:11.08,"possible, because if it becomesobvious to the group, then I'm"
121,00:09:14.21,00:09:14.21,going to have a giant target onmy back.
122,00:09:16.25,00:09:16.25,I wonder if we'll get somesharks.
123,00:09:18.12,00:09:18.12,>> I hope so.>> Watch out.
124,00:09:35.62,00:09:35.62,>> That's the same color Ifound.
125,00:09:37.62,00:09:37.62,"I started off working out aflirting angle with James, and"
126,00:09:40.08,00:09:40.08,"it was just so easy because he'sjust so cute, you know?"
127,00:09:44.12,00:09:44.12,">> What do you think, Amanda, isit love?"
128,00:09:47.71,00:09:47.71,>> I don't know.I definitely think that James
129,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,and Parvati have something goingon.
130,00:09:53.21,00:09:53.21,"And, you know, I've alwaysthought Ozzy was really, really"
131,00:09:55.38,00:09:55.38,"cute, and so it's kind of like acouple-y alliance, yeah."
132,00:09:58.79,00:09:58.79,"But we just have to be careful,because I don't want it to screw"
133,00:10:01.12,00:10:01.12,up my game.>> I'm going to finally get some
134,00:10:14.21,00:10:14.21,"sleep.>> Well, this worked out"
135,00:10:15.92,00:10:15.92,beautiful.>> Imagine that.
136,00:10:18.58,00:10:18.58,">> And it's solid.>> Kathy, Chet, and myself, we"
137,00:10:22.46,00:10:22.46,"made a new shelter for the threeof us, and we're going to make"
138,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,it our home.>> I like how they did that on
139,00:10:28.08,00:10:28.08,part of their wall.>> Definitely.
140,00:10:30.04,00:10:30.04,That's a crazy covering.That's awesome.
141,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,>> I think if we build it hereand you guys have already have
142,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,"yours, and we have a fire in themiddle, then we can all just sit"
143,00:10:37.83,00:10:37.83,down and just bury the hatchet.>> Clean that out and use the
144,00:10:40.83,00:10:40.83,"back of the tree.>> No, I would like you to, yes,"
145,00:10:44.50,00:10:44.50,"please.>> The other seven, they came"
146,00:10:48.08,00:10:48.08,"over and asked me to help thembuild their new shelter, so I"
147,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,think that I've earned a littlebit of respect from them.
148,00:10:54.58,00:10:54.58,"But right now, all I care aboutis getting a fire, because if I"
149,00:10:56.92,00:10:56.92,"don't get some water in me, I'mgoing to die."
150,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,>> We are going to get it rightnow.
151,00:11:01.42,00:11:01.42,">> We are.>> Blow, blow."
152,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,Keep blowing.>> Get some little sticks in
153,00:11:24.04,00:11:24.04,there.>> There we go!
154,00:11:27.21,00:11:27.21,>> Yes!>> We made fire!
155,00:11:31.33,00:11:31.33,"Feels so good!>> Finally, we got fire."
156,00:11:36.04,00:11:36.04,"Now we can boil water.We actually found some clams,"
157,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"so we're going to get some foodin our bellies, and it's"
158,00:11:42.38,00:11:42.38,definitely a really goodfeeling.
159,00:11:44.46,00:11:44.46,">> Food, finally!>> Oh, my god!"
160,00:11:46.79,00:11:46.79,Oh!>> That is so good!
161,00:11:49.25,00:11:49.25,">> Oh, boy!>> The whole dynamic of the"
162,00:11:51.50,00:11:51.50,tribe just completely turnedaround.
163,00:11:54.50,00:11:54.50,">> Everybody seems to kind ofput their issues behind them,"
164,00:11:56.58,00:11:56.58,and we're much more unified as atribe.
165,00:11:59.50,00:11:59.50,And what's that right in themiddle?
166,00:12:01.96,00:12:01.96,>> A ticket stub.I go to a lot of ball games and
167,00:12:04.25,00:12:04.25,a lot of concerts.>> Yeah.
168,00:12:08.00,00:12:08.00,">> Oh, my God, I love it.>> I'm definitely flirting with"
169,00:12:12.58,00:12:12.58,"Mary, absolutely.She's a cute girl and I'm having"
170,00:12:15.88,00:12:15.88,"fun with her on the island.She's a friendly, funny girl to"
171,00:12:19.04,00:12:19.04,"get along with.I want to get Mary to trust me,"
172,00:12:22.33,00:12:22.33,and if I can use my flirtatiousability to get her in my back
173,00:12:26.08,00:12:26.08,"pocket, then I'm going to useit."
174,00:12:28.83,00:12:28.83,"Come here.>> Oh, god."
175,00:12:33.58,00:12:33.58,>> Protein!Protein!
176,00:12:36.17,00:12:36.17,">> Mikey, I think, really likeshow Mary looks, and has"
177,00:12:39.83,00:12:39.83,maneuvered himself pretty closeto her.
178,00:12:42.08,00:12:42.08,"That's right out of, you know,Player School 101, I think."
179,00:12:45.33,00:12:45.33,"So obviously, I'm going to keepmy eyes on them."
180,00:12:48.83,00:12:48.83,"But my priority right now is tokeep my tribe strong, so I think"
181,00:12:52.08,00:12:52.08,"the three outsiders, Tracy,Chet, and Kathy, they'll be out"
182,00:12:56.17,00:12:56.17,of here as soon as possible.>> I was awake quite a bit last
183,00:13:35.96,00:13:35.96,"night, and I heard the soundsof..."
184,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,"...jungle love, I guess.I think we'll be receiving birth"
185,00:13:45.42,00:13:45.42,announcements from Amanda onher little Ozzlets she's about
186,00:13:48.33,00:13:48.33,to have.And Parvati and James will be at
187,00:13:53.08,00:13:53.08,the wedding as soon as this isover.

378,00:26:51.96,00:26:51.96,"across the ocean.Oh, my god!"
379,00:26:56.29,00:26:56.29,"By the time we found the fourthclue, I was so tired and so"
380,00:26:59.42,00:26:59.42,frustrated.And we searched and searched and
381,00:27:03.25,00:27:03.25,"searched and searched.>> I know, it's almost like,"
382,00:27:07.46,00:27:07.46,"okay, you can come out now,idol."
383,00:27:10.17,00:27:10.17,We give up.>> We can't get this close and
384,00:27:12.29,00:27:12.29,then not find it.>> I know.

386,00:27:29.88,00:27:29.88,ready to get some water.>> I think we need a round of
387,00:27:32.33,00:27:32.33,"applause for everyone today.Because no matter what, we come"
388,00:27:35.17,00:27:35.17,"together as a team, we win andlose as a team."
389,00:27:40.21,00:27:40.21,>> I give it to all of you thatswam.
390,00:27:42.17,00:27:42.17,">> It was a lot tougher.>> We lost our challenge today,"
391,00:27:45.12,00:27:45.12,so this is our first time goingto tribal council.
392,00:27:47.88,00:27:47.88,"I mean, that's a big deal, andwe're all very frustrated."
393,00:27:51.12,00:27:51.12,I don't care about losing theimmunity.
394,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,"I care about the fishing stuff,because that box is a box of"
395,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,"gold, you know?There was everything there."
396,00:27:58.96,00:27:58.96,It's most likely going to be oneof the three older members of
397,00:28:02.62,00:28:02.62,"the tribe going home, probablyChet, because he did very, very"
398,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,"poorly in the challenge.I mean, he was floundering"
399,00:28:08.67,00:28:08.67,around.If Chet's strength is what he
400,00:28:12.42,00:28:12.42,"showed today, then come on.There's no discussion as far as"
401,00:28:15.08,00:28:15.08,I'm concerned.All of us know who we want to go
402,00:28:18.38,00:28:18.38,home.That would be Chet.
403,00:28:21.21,00:28:21.21,But there's all these variablesthat come into play which makes
404,00:28:24.33,00:28:24.33,"it difficult.Okay, and then the girls vote"
405,00:28:27.46,00:28:27.46,Tracy.And then they're going to have
406,00:28:31.54,00:28:31.54,"their three votes versus you,okay?"
407,00:28:34.17,00:28:34.17,"So that's four to three, andChet goes home."
408,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,"I'm suggesting splitting ourvotes, four to Chet and three to"
409,00:28:39.46,00:28:39.46,"Tracy, just in case Kathy foundthe hidden immunity on Exile"
410,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,"Island.If she had it, they can give it"
411,00:28:46.04,00:28:46.04,"to Chet or Tracy, and then if wevote them, it bounces back to"
412,00:28:49.58,00:28:49.58,"us, and we're screwed.If Kathy gives the immunity idol"
413,00:28:54.42,00:28:54.42,"to Chet, us guys, us four, votefor Tracy, and the girls, the"
414,00:29:00.00,00:29:00.00,"three, vote for Kathy.>> Wait, wait, wait."
415,00:29:03.21,00:29:03.21,That's in the case of what?>> If she gives it to Chet.
416,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,">> Yeah.>> Now, the only way we can get"
417,00:29:07.54,00:29:07.54,"screwed is if Kathy gave Tracythe immunity, and then it goes"
418,00:29:13.29,00:29:13.29,to a tiebreaker.>> We have to stick to it.
419,00:29:18.17,00:29:18.17,That's what I'm saying.Let's get the final plan right
420,00:29:20.21,00:29:20.21,now and we don't have to talkabout it again.
421,00:29:22.33,00:29:22.33,>> Mike is throwing out all ofhis different scenarios on what
422,00:29:25.67,00:29:25.67,if Kathy found the immunity idolon Exile Island?
423,00:29:28.92,00:29:28.92,"She already has an immunity idolfrom a previous challenge, on"
424,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,"and on and on and on, so much sothat it confuses me."
425,00:29:39.58,00:29:39.58,"My initial thought was, ""Chet,you're out of here."
426,00:29:42.08,00:29:42.08,"You're done.""But Mikey thinks he's got it all"
427,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,"figured out, and I don't likethat."
428,00:29:47.88,00:29:47.88,"He's teamed up with Mary, andnow he thinks he has pretty much"
429,00:29:51.88,00:29:51.88,"the entire tribe voting the wayhe wants us to vote, and doing"
430,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,whatever he wants.But if I have anything to say
431,00:30:00.08,00:30:00.08,"about that at tribal counciltomorrow night, it will be"
432,00:30:02.33,00:30:02.33,abundantly clear that that's notthe case.
433,00:30:32.08,00:30:32.08,">> Yesterday we lost theimmunity challenge, so tonight"
434,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,we're all going to tribalcouncil.
435,00:30:36.83,00:30:36.83,And Mikey seems to think thathe's running the show over here.
436,00:30:39.71,00:30:39.71,And I just want to put a stop toit.
437,00:30:47.75,00:30:47.75,"Mikey and Mary are very close,and I believe that if we have"
438,00:30:51.00,00:30:51.00,one person who believes thatthey are leading this tribe in a
439,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,"certain direction, theirstrongest alliance, in my mind,"
440,00:30:56.92,00:30:56.92,"would be the alliance to break.If you take away Mary, that's"
441,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33,"his closest ally.>> Joel suggested we, along with"
442,00:31:07.17,00:31:07.17,"Alexis, work together to get ridof Mary."
443,00:31:10.33,00:31:10.33,And it could be a good idea.Because Mikey is a really smart
444,00:31:13.67,00:31:13.67,"guy, and he knows what he'sdoing here."
445,00:31:17.79,00:31:17.79,"That's pretty diabolical, but Imean, come on."
446,00:31:19.83,00:31:19.83,">> It's what the game is, bro.>> Yeah."
447,00:31:37.12,00:31:37.12,">> Yeah, that's Kathy.>> Yeah."
448,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,>> Want to try to get rid ofMary and break up the Mike and

450,00:31:52.75,00:31:52.75,"little tiny piece of beach, andthat's it."
451,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,>> How was it out there?>> Cirie is one of the nicest
452,00:31:58.00,00:31:58.00,people I ever met in my entirelife.
453,00:32:02.92,00:32:02.92,"No, I curled up in a fetalposition."
454,00:32:09.33,00:32:09.33,So what's going on around herewith you guys as far as tribal
455,00:32:11.38,00:32:11.38,council?>> That's all I'm telling you.
456,00:32:25.29,00:32:25.29,Just do it.Just write it down.
457,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,">> I was super worried that theywere all going to pick Chet, and"
458,00:32:30.71,00:32:30.71,"when I come back from ExileIsland, boy, right away, Joel"
459,00:32:33.46,00:32:33.46,"steps up to me and goes, ""It'sMary."""
460,00:32:36.71,00:32:36.71,"I'm like, ""Where did Mary comefrom?"""
461,00:32:39.12,00:32:39.12,>> Don't spill the beans beforewe vote.
462,00:32:41.42,00:32:41.42,>> You have to tell me what Ican say and what I can't say.
463,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,>> It's like I tell my pageantgirls-- answer the question and
464,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,shut up.Don't ramble.
465,00:32:49.21,00:32:49.21,"Get off the stage.>> Over the last two days, it"
466,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,"was Kathy, Chet, and myselfagainst the other seven."
467,00:32:55.12,00:32:55.12,"And now we finally see a windowof opportunity, but I just don't"
468,00:32:58.75,00:32:58.75,"know if I can trust Joel.Joel wants this million dollars,"
469,00:33:02.21,00:33:02.21,"I think, probably more thananybody here."
470,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,And I feel that he's going tostop at nothing to get it.
471,00:33:07.54,00:33:07.54,>> We've got a plan.Don't talk to anybody else about
472,00:33:10.04,00:33:10.04,"it.>> Joel's pulled Natalie aside,"
473,00:33:14.29,00:33:14.29,"talked to her a little bit, sowe don't know really what"
474,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"they're talking about, but wejust need to be really honest"
475,00:33:19.42,00:33:19.42,"with ourselves, and where theweaknesses lie."
476,00:33:22.75,00:33:22.75,">> All of us guys vote Chet, andif she gives the immunity to"
477,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,"Chet, we all vote Tracy.Girls all voting Tracy."
478,00:33:29.12,00:33:29.12,>> There might be a littleconfusion as far as our vote
479,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"tonight, but I really feel atthis point I can trust Alexis, I"
480,00:33:35.96,00:33:35.96,"can trust Mike, I can trustNatalie."
481,00:33:39.38,00:33:39.38,So I don't feel like I'm goingto be voted off anytime soon.
482,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,>> I think it will beinteresting checking out tribal

484,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,>> That will be fun.>> If it goes as I think it
485,00:33:48.79,00:33:48.79,"will, tonight, Mary's goinghome."
486,00:33:52.54,00:33:52.54,Mikey will be completelyconfused as to what happened.
487,00:33:55.00,00:33:55.00,And it will be me running theshow over here.
488,00:33:58.71,00:33:58.71,But I've been doing a lot ofrunning around.
489,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,"I've been talking to a lot ofpeople, and if these people are"
490,00:34:03.88,00:34:03.88,"smart, I could see themthinking, ""He's too powerful,"
491,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"he's too manipulative,"" andbeing very leery of me."
492,00:34:12.04,00:34:12.04,"But either way, I think on myfeet, so we'll see what happens."

499,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,"So let's start at the beginning.Kathy, right off the bat, one"
500,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,person from each tribe got animmunity idol.
501,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,How did you end up with it foryour tribe?
502,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,">> I came in last, and Yau-Manpointed out that my idol was"
503,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,"under the boat, so I picked itup."

508,00:35:29.12,00:35:29.12,plays tonight.>> Yes.
509,00:35:31.29,00:35:31.29,>> JEFF: Let's talk about thechallenge.
510,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"Chet, this challenge for you wasextremely difficult."

513,00:35:42.58,00:35:42.58,I thought it was best to comeback in and let somebody else go
514,00:35:44.79,00:35:44.79,"back out, because I felt I waswasting too much time out there."
515,00:35:46.75,00:35:46.75,">> JEFF: With all due respect,that's giving yourself a little"

535,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,>> Absolutely.I feel that some people have
536,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,"been segregated, and now we havetwo shelters, so clearly there"
537,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,are people that get along andpeople that don't get along.

546,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,this point.People have to vote how they
