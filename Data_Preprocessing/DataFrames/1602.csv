1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00," >> JEFF: Previously on Survivor,"
2,00:00:03.21,00:00:03.21,ten of Survivor's biggest fans were pitted against ten
3,00:00:06.25,00:00:06.25,favorites from seasons past. Both tribes immediately competed
4,00:00:11.46,00:00:11.46,for a shot at individual immunity.
5,00:00:15.42,00:00:15.42,"Yau-Man narrowly won the idol for the favorites, and he helped"
6,00:00:18.79,00:00:18.79,Kathy find the idol for the fans.
7,00:00:21.83,00:00:21.83,>> Pick up that! >> JEFF: The fans struggled on
8,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,their beach and failed to build a solid shelter.
9,00:00:35.79,00:00:35.79,">> JEFF: Go! At the first immunity challenge,"
10,00:00:38.46,00:00:38.46,"the favorites relied on experience, but experience"
11,00:00:41.25,00:00:41.25,wasn't enough. The first immunity challenge is
12,00:00:44.75,00:00:44.75,"won by the fans! Facing tribal council, the"
13,00:00:51.00,00:00:51.00,favorites were split into two alliances.
14,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17,">> Ami, Yau-Man, Jonathan and myself, the four of us are a"
15,00:00:57.04,00:00:57.04,"tight alliance, but there's another foursome out here--"
16,00:01:00.00,00:01:00.00,Amanda and Ozzy and Parvati and James.
17,00:01:03.12,00:01:03.12,>> JEFF: And both groups wanted to recruit the same player.
18,00:01:05.96,00:01:05.96,>> We need a fifth. >> I say Fairplay.
19,00:01:08.25,00:01:08.25,>> We need Fairplay to make a strong alliance.
20,00:01:11.88,00:01:11.88,>> JEFF: But Fairplay made a surprising revelation to his
21,00:01:13.83,00:01:13.83,tribe. >> JEFF: Not everyone was
22,00:01:22.88,00:01:22.88,convinced he was telling the truth.
23,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,">> If I know Jonny Fairplay, he is going to pull something out"
24,00:01:27.21,00:01:27.21,"of his hat that none of us are going to be expecting, and he is"
25,00:01:29.08,00:01:29.08,"going to stir things up. >> JEFF: But in the end, the"
26,00:01:33.42,00:01:33.42,"entire tribe wrote down his name, and severed ties with one"
27,00:01:36.33,00:01:36.33,of the most infamous players to play the game.
28,00:01:40.12,00:01:40.12,"Jonny Fairplay, the tribe has spoken."
29,00:01:43.12,00:01:43.12,19 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
30,00:02:00.12,00:02:00.12,>> I can't believe you just caught that fish with your bare
31,00:02:02.25,00:02:02.25,hands. >> I know.
32,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,"How awesome is that? >> Yes, guys, we lost Fairplay,"
33,00:02:06.79,00:02:06.79,but we did gain a fish. Maybe that's a good omen.
34,00:02:12.67,00:02:12.67,>> How awesome is it we came back and now we're eating fish?
35,00:02:15.54,00:02:15.54,>> I know. A late-night snack.
36,00:02:18.42,00:02:18.42,">> Well, we had tribal council tonight, and Jonny Fairplay had"
37,00:02:21.17,00:02:21.17,asked us to vote him off. And I kept thinking something
38,00:02:25.33,00:02:25.33,"was going to change, something was gone going to happen,"
39,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,something terrible-- that I was going to be the one going home
40,00:02:29.42,00:02:29.42,first. But we took him seriously and we
41,00:02:31.46,00:02:31.46,honored his request. >> There was just too much going
42,00:02:34.29,00:02:34.29,"on for him, which is weird, because he seemed to be holding"
43,00:02:37.42,00:02:37.42,it together. I was not pleased when Jonny
44,00:02:42.00,00:02:42.00,"pulled this, because it screwed up my plans."
45,00:02:44.92,00:02:44.92,But you know what? Everybody knows that if we can
46,00:02:47.92,00:02:47.92,"continue to do what we're doing, we should be able to win."
47,00:02:50.25,00:02:50.25,">> I'll tell you what, it is delicious."
48,00:02:53.58,00:02:53.58,"I mean, I figure that if everyone had been out here for"
49,00:02:55.92,00:02:55.92,"30, 33, 39 days, something like that, times nine, that's"
50,00:02:59.04,00:02:59.04,basically a year's worth of experience.
51,00:03:01.83,00:03:01.83,We're just feeling confident that we can go in there and beat
52,00:03:03.79,00:03:03.79,these guys at almost any challenge.

55,00:04:28.29,00:04:28.29,>> But there's still a lot of stuff we need to do.
56,00:04:30.58,00:04:30.58,>> We need water. >> All this needs to be cleared
57,00:04:34.12,00:04:34.12,"because it smells like... >> It's day four, and we're in a"
58,00:04:42.67,00:04:42.67,bad place right now. We need to fix our shelter.
59,00:04:45.62,00:04:45.62,We haven't had any water. Everyone is tired.
60,00:04:48.04,00:04:48.04,"Everyone is hungry. But at the challenge yesterday,"
61,00:04:50.38,00:04:50.38,"we beat the favorites, won immunity, and along with"
62,00:04:53.25,00:04:53.25,"immunity, we also won flint, and flint is fire."
63,00:04:56.83,00:04:56.83,"So we're golden. As soon as I light this, it's"
64,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,"going to ignite immediately. >> Like, boom!"
65,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,">> Woo! >> Keep it going, keep it going."
66,00:05:12.75,00:05:12.75,>> Keep blowing. Blow more.
67,00:05:45.25,00:05:45.25,>> How much of this do we have left?
68,00:05:47.42,00:05:47.42,>> We've got to make fire! I don't care how much we have!
69,00:05:49.79,00:05:49.79,">> At some point, we've got to give up and say..."
70,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,>> What are they doing now with the fire?
71,00:05:54.25,00:05:54.25,Do we know? Let's go find out.
72,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,>> The boys are still back there trying to start a fire.
73,00:06:00.12,00:06:00.12,"They're all chopping away, but we've got nothing!"
74,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,"Number one priority for me is shelter, because pretty much"
75,00:06:06.54,00:06:06.54,every night it rains. So let's go and let's do it.
76,00:06:09.62,00:06:09.62,What is the problem? I don't understand.
77,00:06:12.62,00:06:12.62,>> Why is everybody talking all the time and not working?
78,00:06:15.92,00:06:15.92,">> Oh, this will be the worst night in the history of our"
79,00:06:18.62,00:06:18.62,lives. >> We've got no shelter.
80,00:06:21.12,00:06:21.12,Nothing. >> Yeah.
81,00:06:23.79,00:06:23.79,>> Then let's all... can we all get in on it and start humping
82,00:06:26.17,00:06:26.17,"it? >> No, they're not going to help"
83,00:06:29.33,00:06:29.33,build a shelter. They're going to go dig for
84,00:06:31.25,00:06:31.25,wood. >> I just spent a half hour
85,00:06:40.25,00:06:40.25,trying to do fire! All you do is run your mouth.
86,00:06:45.21,00:06:45.21,">> And we have not had to go to tribal council yet, and there's"
87,00:06:48.54,00:06:48.54,"drama! >> We can clean out that cave,"
88,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,"shush it out with some palm fronds, lay some down, and we"
89,00:06:59.21,00:06:59.21,"can sleep clean and dry tonight. See, they're already cleaning it"
90,00:07:02.71,00:07:02.71,"out. Oh, those rat bastards."
91,00:07:05.00,00:07:05.00,>> Yeah. >> This is exactly what we were
92,00:07:06.83,00:07:06.83,getting ready to do. >> We were going to come and
93,00:07:08.42,00:07:08.42,"clean it out and put some palm fronds down, and that was going"
94,00:07:10.08,00:07:10.08,"to be home tonight. >> No, this is my habitat"
95,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"tonight. >> Tracy, Kathy, and Chet, I"
96,00:07:19.12,00:07:19.12,don't think they accomplished a single productive thing all day
97,00:07:22.58,00:07:22.58,long. And I just don't even want to be
98,00:07:24.62,00:07:24.62,"around them, so I told them straight up, I was like, ""I"
99,00:07:27.17,00:07:27.17,"don't want you sleeping in the cave."""
100,00:07:29.33,00:07:29.33,">> I'm not going to fight with these kids, you know?"
101,00:07:31.92,00:07:31.92,"I mean, they hate us. Come on."
102,00:07:37.12,00:07:37.12,">> Tracy, Chet, and myself have pretty much been shunned by the"
103,00:07:40.71,00:07:40.71,other people. And you can't fight seven
104,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,against three. It just makes you relive things
105,00:07:46.67,00:07:46.67,"in your life-- high school, whatever-- when you didn't fit"
106,00:07:49.12,00:07:49.12,in and you were kind of outcast. It just kind of brings it all
107,00:07:51.21,00:07:51.21,"back. >> Yeah, let's do that."
108,00:07:57.92,00:07:57.92,"Let's grab it. >> Oh, they took it."
109,00:08:02.21,00:08:02.21,">> They just took it. >> Okay, okay."
110,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,>> Tell me we're not divided. >> We were quite disorganized in
111,00:08:27.88,00:08:27.88,"the last challenge, so we're going to try to do a little"
112,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,better today. And we're hoping that the fans
113,00:08:33.04,00:08:33.04,"have slept poorly and are still way behind us on the camp curve,"
114,00:08:37.96,00:08:37.96,"because we're doing great, I mean, honestly."
115,00:08:52.58,00:08:52.58,>> And we thought this one was big.
116,00:08:54.62,00:08:54.62,>> Yeah. >> Right?
117,00:08:56.88,00:08:56.88,>> Yeah. I'm starting to become... I'm
118,00:09:00.42,00:09:00.42,starting to become really attracted to Amanda.
119,00:09:03.08,00:09:03.08,"She is so cute. I mean, she's beautiful, and"
120,00:09:05.71,00:09:05.71,"it's like... oh, we've just got to stay apart as long as"
121,00:09:11.08,00:09:11.08,"possible, because if it becomes obvious to the group, then I'm"
122,00:09:14.21,00:09:14.21,going to have a giant target on my back.
123,00:09:16.25,00:09:16.25,I wonder if we'll get some sharks.
124,00:09:18.12,00:09:18.12,>> I hope so. >> Watch out.
125,00:09:35.62,00:09:35.62,>> That's the same color I found.
126,00:09:37.62,00:09:37.62,"I started off working out a flirting angle with James, and"
127,00:09:40.08,00:09:40.08,"it was just so easy because he's just so cute, you know?"
128,00:09:44.12,00:09:44.12,">> What do you think, Amanda, is it love?"
129,00:09:47.71,00:09:47.71,>> I don't know. I definitely think that James
130,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,and Parvati have something going on.
131,00:09:53.21,00:09:53.21,"And, you know, I've always thought Ozzy was really, really"
132,00:09:55.38,00:09:55.38,"cute, and so it's kind of like a couple-y alliance, yeah."
133,00:09:58.79,00:09:58.79,"But we just have to be careful, because I don't want it to screw"
134,00:10:01.12,00:10:01.12,up my game. >> I'm going to finally get some
135,00:10:14.21,00:10:14.21,"sleep. >> Well, this worked out"
136,00:10:15.92,00:10:15.92,beautiful. >> Imagine that.
137,00:10:18.58,00:10:18.58,">> And it's solid. >> Kathy, Chet, and myself, we"
138,00:10:22.46,00:10:22.46,"made a new shelter for the three of us, and we're going to make"
139,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,it our home. >> I like how they did that on
140,00:10:28.08,00:10:28.08,part of their wall. >> Definitely.
141,00:10:30.04,00:10:30.04,That's a crazy covering. That's awesome.
142,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,>> I think if we build it here and you guys have already have
143,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,"yours, and we have a fire in the middle, then we can all just sit"
144,00:10:37.83,00:10:37.83,down and just bury the hatchet. >> Clean that out and use the
145,00:10:40.83,00:10:40.83,"back of the tree. >> No, I would like you to, yes,"
146,00:10:44.50,00:10:44.50,"please. >> The other seven, they came"
147,00:10:48.08,00:10:48.08,"over and asked me to help them build their new shelter, so I"
148,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,think that I've earned a little bit of respect from them.
149,00:10:54.58,00:10:54.58,"But right now, all I care about is getting a fire, because if I"
150,00:10:56.92,00:10:56.92,"don't get some water in me, I'm going to die."
151,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,>> We are going to get it right now.
152,00:11:01.42,00:11:01.42,">> We are. >> Blow, blow."
153,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,Keep blowing. >> Get some little sticks in
154,00:11:24.04,00:11:24.04,there. >> There we go!
155,00:11:27.21,00:11:27.21,>> Yes! >> We made fire!
156,00:11:31.33,00:11:31.33,"Feels so good! >> Finally, we got fire."
157,00:11:36.04,00:11:36.04,"Now we can boil water. We actually found some clams,"
158,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"so we're going to get some food in our bellies, and it's"
159,00:11:42.38,00:11:42.38,definitely a really good feeling.
160,00:11:44.46,00:11:44.46,">> Food, finally! >> Oh, my god!"
161,00:11:46.79,00:11:46.79,Oh! >> That is so good!
162,00:11:49.25,00:11:49.25,">> Oh, boy! >> The whole dynamic of the"
163,00:11:51.50,00:11:51.50,tribe just completely turned around.
164,00:11:54.50,00:11:54.50,">> Everybody seems to kind of put their issues behind them,"
165,00:11:56.58,00:11:56.58,and we're much more unified as a tribe.
166,00:11:59.50,00:11:59.50,And what's that right in the middle?
167,00:12:01.96,00:12:01.96,>> A ticket stub. I go to a lot of ball games and
168,00:12:04.25,00:12:04.25,a lot of concerts. >> Yeah.
169,00:12:08.00,00:12:08.00,">> Oh, my God, I love it. >> I'm definitely flirting with"
170,00:12:12.58,00:12:12.58,"Mary, absolutely. She's a cute girl and I'm having"
171,00:12:15.88,00:12:15.88,"fun with her on the island. She's a friendly, funny girl to"
172,00:12:19.04,00:12:19.04,"get along with. I want to get Mary to trust me,"
173,00:12:22.33,00:12:22.33,and if I can use my flirtatious ability to get her in my back
174,00:12:26.08,00:12:26.08,"pocket, then I'm going to use it."
175,00:12:28.83,00:12:28.83,"Come here. >> Oh, god."
176,00:12:33.58,00:12:33.58,>> Protein! Protein!
177,00:12:36.17,00:12:36.17,">> Mikey, I think, really likes how Mary looks, and has"
178,00:12:39.83,00:12:39.83,maneuvered himself pretty close to her.
179,00:12:42.08,00:12:42.08,"That's right out of, you know, Player School 101, I think."
180,00:12:45.33,00:12:45.33,"So obviously, I'm going to keep my eyes on them."
181,00:12:48.83,00:12:48.83,"But my priority right now is to keep my tribe strong, so I think"
182,00:12:52.08,00:12:52.08,"the three outsiders, Tracy, Chet, and Kathy, they'll be out"
183,00:12:56.17,00:12:56.17,of here as soon as possible. >> I was awake quite a bit last
184,00:13:35.96,00:13:35.96,"night, and I heard the sounds of..."
185,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,"...jungle love, I guess. I think we'll be receiving birth"
186,00:13:45.42,00:13:45.42,announcements from Amanda on her little Ozzlets she's about
187,00:13:48.33,00:13:48.33,to have. And Parvati and James will be at
188,00:13:53.08,00:13:53.08,the wedding as soon as this is over.
189,00:13:55.21,00:13:55.21,"So yeah, it's a little more than just alliances there with those"

380,00:26:56.29,00:26:56.29,"By the time we found the fourth clue, I was so tired and so"
381,00:26:59.42,00:26:59.42,frustrated. And we searched and searched and
382,00:27:03.25,00:27:03.25,"searched and searched. >> I know, it's almost like,"
383,00:27:07.46,00:27:07.46,"okay, you can come out now, idol."
384,00:27:10.17,00:27:10.17,We give up. >> We can't get this close and
385,00:27:12.29,00:27:12.29,then not find it. >> I know.
386,00:27:26.04,00:27:26.04,">> We need to get some coconuts and get the shelter ready, get"
387,00:27:29.88,00:27:29.88,ready to get some water. >> I think we need a round of
388,00:27:32.33,00:27:32.33,"applause for everyone today. Because no matter what, we come"
389,00:27:35.17,00:27:35.17,"together as a team, we win and lose as a team."
390,00:27:40.21,00:27:40.21,>> I give it to all of you that swam.
391,00:27:42.17,00:27:42.17,">> It was a lot tougher. >> We lost our challenge today,"
392,00:27:45.12,00:27:45.12,so this is our first time going to tribal council.
393,00:27:47.88,00:27:47.88,"I mean, that's a big deal, and we're all very frustrated."
394,00:27:51.12,00:27:51.12,I don't care about losing the immunity.
395,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,"I care about the fishing stuff, because that box is a box of"
396,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,"gold, you know? There was everything there."
397,00:27:58.96,00:27:58.96,It's most likely going to be one of the three older members of
398,00:28:02.62,00:28:02.62,"the tribe going home, probably Chet, because he did very, very"
399,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,"poorly in the challenge. I mean, he was floundering"
400,00:28:08.67,00:28:08.67,around. If Chet's strength is what he
401,00:28:12.42,00:28:12.42,"showed today, then come on. There's no discussion as far as"
402,00:28:15.08,00:28:15.08,I'm concerned. All of us know who we want to go
403,00:28:18.38,00:28:18.38,home. That would be Chet.
404,00:28:21.21,00:28:21.21,But there's all these variables that come into play which makes
405,00:28:24.33,00:28:24.33,"it difficult. Okay, and then the girls vote"
406,00:28:27.46,00:28:27.46,Tracy. And then they're going to have
407,00:28:31.54,00:28:31.54,"their three votes versus you, okay?"
408,00:28:34.17,00:28:34.17,"So that's four to three, and Chet goes home."
409,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,"I'm suggesting splitting our votes, four to Chet and three to"
410,00:28:39.46,00:28:39.46,"Tracy, just in case Kathy found the hidden immunity on Exile"
411,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,"Island. If she had it, they can give it"
412,00:28:46.04,00:28:46.04,"to Chet or Tracy, and then if we vote them, it bounces back to"
413,00:28:49.58,00:28:49.58,"us, and we're screwed. If Kathy gives the immunity idol"
414,00:28:54.42,00:28:54.42,"to Chet, us guys, us four, vote for Tracy, and the girls, the"
415,00:29:00.00,00:29:00.00,"three, vote for Kathy. >> Wait, wait, wait."
416,00:29:03.21,00:29:03.21,That's in the case of what? >> If she gives it to Chet.
417,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,">> Yeah. >> Now, the only way we can get"
418,00:29:07.54,00:29:07.54,"screwed is if Kathy gave Tracy the immunity, and then it goes"
419,00:29:13.29,00:29:13.29,to a tiebreaker. >> We have to stick to it.
420,00:29:18.17,00:29:18.17,That's what I'm saying. Let's get the final plan right
421,00:29:20.21,00:29:20.21,now and we don't have to talk about it again.
422,00:29:22.33,00:29:22.33,>> Mike is throwing out all of his different scenarios on what
423,00:29:25.67,00:29:25.67,if Kathy found the immunity idol on Exile Island?
424,00:29:28.92,00:29:28.92,"She already has an immunity idol from a previous challenge, on"
425,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,"and on and on and on, so much so that it confuses me."
426,00:29:39.58,00:29:39.58,"My initial thought was, ""Chet, you're out of here."
427,00:29:42.08,00:29:42.08,"You're done."" But Mikey thinks he's got it all"
428,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,"figured out, and I don't like that."
429,00:29:47.88,00:29:47.88,"He's teamed up with Mary, and now he thinks he has pretty much"
430,00:29:51.88,00:29:51.88,"the entire tribe voting the way he wants us to vote, and doing"
431,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,whatever he wants. But if I have anything to say
432,00:30:00.08,00:30:00.08,"about that at tribal council tomorrow night, it will be"
433,00:30:02.33,00:30:02.33,abundantly clear that that's not the case.
434,00:30:32.08,00:30:32.08,">> Yesterday we lost the immunity challenge, so tonight"
435,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,we're all going to tribal council.
436,00:30:36.83,00:30:36.83,And Mikey seems to think that he's running the show over here.
437,00:30:39.71,00:30:39.71,And I just want to put a stop to it.
438,00:30:47.75,00:30:47.75,"Mikey and Mary are very close, and I believe that if we have"
439,00:30:51.00,00:30:51.00,one person who believes that they are leading this tribe in a
440,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,"certain direction, their strongest alliance, in my mind,"
441,00:30:56.92,00:30:56.92,"would be the alliance to break. If you take away Mary, that's"
442,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33,"his closest ally. >> Joel suggested we, along with"
443,00:31:07.17,00:31:07.17,"Alexis, work together to get rid of Mary."
444,00:31:10.33,00:31:10.33,And it could be a good idea. Because Mikey is a really smart
445,00:31:13.67,00:31:13.67,"guy, and he knows what he's doing here."
446,00:31:17.79,00:31:17.79,"That's pretty diabolical, but I mean, come on."
447,00:31:19.83,00:31:19.83,">> It's what the game is, bro. >> Yeah."
448,00:31:37.12,00:31:37.12,">> Yeah, that's Kathy. >> Yeah."
449,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,>> Want to try to get rid of Mary and break up the Mike and
450,00:31:47.21,00:31:47.21,"Mary? >> Oh, my god, it's just a"
451,00:31:52.75,00:31:52.75,"little tiny piece of beach, and that's it."
452,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,>> How was it out there? >> Cirie is one of the nicest
453,00:31:58.00,00:31:58.00,people I ever met in my entire life.
454,00:32:02.92,00:32:02.92,"No, I curled up in a fetal position."
455,00:32:09.33,00:32:09.33,So what's going on around here with you guys as far as tribal
456,00:32:11.38,00:32:11.38,council? >> That's all I'm telling you.
457,00:32:25.29,00:32:25.29,Just do it. Just write it down.
458,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,">> I was super worried that they were all going to pick Chet, and"
459,00:32:30.71,00:32:30.71,"when I come back from Exile Island, boy, right away, Joel"
460,00:32:33.46,00:32:33.46,"steps up to me and goes, ""It's Mary."""
461,00:32:36.71,00:32:36.71,"I'm like, ""Where did Mary come from?"""
462,00:32:39.12,00:32:39.12,>> Don't spill the beans before we vote.
463,00:32:41.42,00:32:41.42,>> You have to tell me what I can say and what I can't say.
464,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,>> It's like I tell my pageant girls-- answer the question and
465,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,shut up. Don't ramble.
466,00:32:49.21,00:32:49.21,"Get off the stage. >> Over the last two days, it"
467,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,"was Kathy, Chet, and myself against the other seven."
468,00:32:55.12,00:32:55.12,"And now we finally see a window of opportunity, but I just don't"
469,00:32:58.75,00:32:58.75,"know if I can trust Joel. Joel wants this million dollars,"
470,00:33:02.21,00:33:02.21,"I think, probably more than anybody here."
471,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,And I feel that he's going to stop at nothing to get it.
472,00:33:07.54,00:33:07.54,>> We've got a plan. Don't talk to anybody else about
473,00:33:10.04,00:33:10.04,"it. >> Joel's pulled Natalie aside,"
474,00:33:14.29,00:33:14.29,"talked to her a little bit, so we don't know really what"
475,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"they're talking about, but we just need to be really honest"
476,00:33:19.42,00:33:19.42,"with ourselves, and where the weaknesses lie."
477,00:33:22.75,00:33:22.75,">> All of us guys vote Chet, and if she gives the immunity to"
478,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,"Chet, we all vote Tracy. Girls all voting Tracy."
479,00:33:29.12,00:33:29.12,>> There might be a little confusion as far as our vote
480,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"tonight, but I really feel at this point I can trust Alexis, I"
481,00:33:35.96,00:33:35.96,"can trust Mike, I can trust Natalie."
482,00:33:39.38,00:33:39.38,So I don't feel like I'm going to be voted off anytime soon.
483,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,>> I think it will be interesting checking out tribal
484,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,"council tonight, you know, just like going there..."
485,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,>> That will be fun. >> If it goes as I think it
486,00:33:48.79,00:33:48.79,"will, tonight, Mary's going home."
487,00:33:52.54,00:33:52.54,Mikey will be completely confused as to what happened.
488,00:33:55.00,00:33:55.00,And it will be me running the show over here.
489,00:33:58.71,00:33:58.71,But I've been doing a lot of running around.
490,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,"I've been talking to a lot of people, and if these people are"
491,00:34:03.88,00:34:03.88,"smart, I could see them thinking, ""He's too powerful,"
492,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"he's too manipulative,"" and being very leery of me."
493,00:34:12.04,00:34:12.04,"But either way, I think on my feet, so we'll see what happens."
494,00:34:40.92,00:34:40.92,>> JEFF: Behind each of you is a torch.
495,00:34:43.00,00:34:43.00,"Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in"
496,00:34:44.75,00:34:44.75,and get fire. This is part of the ritual of
497,00:34:51.42,00:34:51.42,"tribal council because in this game, fire represents your life."
498,00:34:56.71,00:34:56.71,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
499,00:34:59.38,00:34:59.38,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
500,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,"So let's start at the beginning. Kathy, right off the bat, one"
501,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,person from each tribe got an immunity idol.
502,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,How did you end up with it for your tribe?
503,00:35:12.12,00:35:12.12,">> I came in last, and Yau-Man pointed out that my idol was"
504,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,"under the boat, so I picked it up."
505,00:35:17.67,00:35:17.67,"I picked it up and went, ""Is this it?"""
506,00:35:19.88,00:35:19.88,">> JEFF: The idol you have is only good tonight, which means"
507,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"you can use it for yourself and stay protected, or you can give"
508,00:35:26.25,00:35:26.25,it to somebody before we vote. So you're clear on how that
509,00:35:29.12,00:35:29.12,plays tonight. >> Yes.
510,00:35:31.29,00:35:31.29,>> JEFF: Let's talk about the challenge.
511,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"Chet, this challenge for you was extremely difficult."
512,00:35:36.29,00:35:36.29,You were exhausted before you got halfway out to the platform.
513,00:35:40.71,00:35:40.71,">> Actually, I really wasn't exhausted."
514,00:35:42.58,00:35:42.58,I thought it was best to come back in and let somebody else go
515,00:35:44.79,00:35:44.79,"back out, because I felt I was wasting too much time out there."
516,00:35:46.75,00:35:46.75,">> JEFF: With all due respect, that's giving yourself a little"
517,00:35:49.42,00:35:49.42,more credit than I would. It took you forever to go back
518,00:35:52.33,00:35:52.33,to the beach. >> Okay.
519,00:35:54.21,00:35:54.21,>> JEFF: What's going through your head as you feel the
520,00:35:56.25,00:35:56.25,pressure of nine other people going...
521,00:35:58.54,00:35:58.54,">> Obviously it was a lot of pressure, but it was what it"
522,00:36:00.75,00:36:00.75,was. And I would have it liked to
523,00:36:02.75,00:36:02.75,"have been better, but it wasn't. It didn't turn out that way."
524,00:36:06.33,00:36:06.33,>> JEFF: Mikey B. >> I think the most frustrating
525,00:36:09.25,00:36:09.25,"thing about Chet struggling was, if you're not that good of a"
526,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,"swimmer, why are you not making a team move and step down?"
527,00:36:15.50,00:36:15.50,"I mean, I was really irked by it, to be honest with you."
528,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,">> JEFF: Tracy, tell me about camp life."
529,00:36:23.96,00:36:23.96,>> It's aggravating. We have a lot of conflicts.
530,00:36:26.33,00:36:26.33,"The older people kind of went one way, and the younger group"
531,00:36:28.62,00:36:28.62,kind of went the other. And you just sort of get a
532,00:36:30.75,00:36:30.75,"little, you know, chafed by it, and you say, ""I'm either going"
533,00:36:33.04,00:36:33.04,"to sit back and whine about it, or I'm going to get up, and take"
534,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,"care of myself."" >> JEFF: Natalie, do you see"
535,00:36:37.75,00:36:37.75,people grouping together because they just get along better?
536,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,>> Absolutely. I feel that some people have
537,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,"been segregated, and now we have two shelters, so clearly there"
538,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,are people that get along and people that don't get along.
539,00:36:50.92,00:36:50.92,">> JEFF: Alexis, two shelters? This doesn't sound good."
540,00:36:53.25,00:36:53.25,">> There was a certain division, and two shelters have been"
541,00:36:57.71,00:36:57.71,"built, one shelter housing Tracy, Chet, and Kathy."
542,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"So yeah, I mean, there's definitely some conflict there."
543,00:37:03.25,00:37:03.25,">> JEFF: Chet, you've got to be a little concerned tonight."
544,00:37:06.33,00:37:06.33,"There are seven people in one shelter, and you three are"
545,00:37:09.38,00:37:09.38,"sitting over there by yourself. >> Sure, it looks bad that it's"
546,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,three against seven. It's really out of my control at
547,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,this point. People have to vote how they
548,00:37:17.08,00:37:17.08,"have to vote. >> JEFF: Erik, would you be"
549,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,"concerned if you were Chet? >> I would be very, very"
550,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,"concerned. I mean, he's outside of the"
551,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,numbers. He's not as physically fit.
552,00:37:25.54,00:37:25.54,"I would be very, very, very scared."
553,00:37:28.50,00:37:28.50,">> JEFF: Mary, let's talk about alliances, or friendships that"
554,00:37:31.29,00:37:31.29,"might be alliances. >> Sure, you can see people"
555,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,"going their different directions, and alliances"
556,00:37:36.54,00:37:36.54,"forming, but I feel pretty secure right now with my"
557,00:37:39.21,00:37:39.21,position in the tribe and with the people that I choose to
558,00:37:42.00,00:37:42.00,communicate with and be friends with.
559,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,">> JEFF: Joel, what do you base a vote on this early in the"
560,00:37:47.54,00:37:47.54,game? You barely know these people.

564,00:38:00.04,00:38:00.04,off tonight. It's a game of loyalty and it's
565,00:38:02.88,00:38:02.88,"a game of deception, and anybody can go at any time."
566,00:38:07.21,00:38:07.21,"And you'll never know who it is. >> JEFF: All right, on that"
