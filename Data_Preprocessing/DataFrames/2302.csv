218,00:06:58.23,00:06:58.23,"EDNA, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE"
219,00:06:59.43,00:06:59.43,"HOHELPED ME ON THE FIRST DAY, SO"
220,00:07:00.87,00:07:00.87,MAYBE I'M JUST A BIG FOOL BUT
221,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,SHE SEEMS LIKE A GENUINELY NICE
222,00:07:04.23,00:07:04.23,PERSON.
223,00:07:04.67,00:07:04.67,I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHO
224,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
225,00:07:10.77,00:07:10.77,I DO YOU REALLY THINK CHRISTINE
226,00:07:12.63,00:07:12.63,FOUND IT WITHOUT ANY CLUES?
227,00:07:14.23,00:07:14.23,SHE WAS DIGGING FOR HOURS OUT
228,00:07:16.43,00:07:16.43,THERE.
229,00:07:16.80,00:07:16.80,WHAT ABOUT TODAY.
230,00:07:18.43,00:07:18.43,NOBODY WAS DIGGING.
231,00:07:20.43,00:07:20.43,THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DIGGING
232,00:07:21.80,00:07:21.80,"BECAUSE I, THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND"
233,00:07:23.43,00:07:23.43,IT.
234,00:07:23.93,00:07:23.93,"THEY'RE VERY TIGHT, TOO, IF YOU"
235,00:07:25.07,00:07:25.07,HAVEN'T NOTICED.
236,00:07:25.80,00:07:25.80,WHO?
237,00:07:26.20,00:07:26.20,STACY AND CHRISTINE.
238,00:07:27.97,00:07:27.97,I THINK MY PLACE IN THE TRIBE IS
239,00:07:29.10,00:07:29.10,PROBABLY THE BOTTOM.
240,00:07:29.77,00:07:29.77,I'M NOT ONE OF THE PHYSICALLY
241,00:07:31.57,00:07:31.57,STRONGEST GIRLS IN THE TRIBE SO
242,00:07:32.47,00:07:32.47,I NEED TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH A

244,00:07:35.70,00:07:35.70,I THINK HE'S A STRONG PLAYER.
245,00:07:37.13,00:07:37.13,HE HAS A HISTORY OF PLAYING
246,00:07:38.90,00:07:38.90,"WELL, SO I WANTED TO SOLIDIFY MY"
247,00:07:40.60,00:07:40.60,RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
248,00:07:41.97,00:07:41.97,I'M ONE OF THE SMALLER FEMALES.
249,00:07:44.07,00:07:44.07,"LISTEN, YOU WANNA KEEP THE"
250,00:07:46.27,00:07:46.27,"TRIBE STRONG BUT TO ME, LOYALTY,"
251,00:07:47.63,00:07:47.63,"I THINK, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT"
252,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,THING.
253,00:07:50.97,00:07:50.97,THANK YOU.
254,00:07:52.47,00:07:52.47,LOYALTY SOMETIMES OUTWEIGHS

257,00:07:58.87,00:07:58.87,SO ARE YOU SOILED WITH ME?

261,00:08:05.13,00:08:05.13,GAME.
262,00:08:05.53,00:08:05.53,I'M THE BIGGEST FOOL IN THIS
263,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,GAME BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL
264,00:08:08.07,00:08:08.07,THAT I WILL FIND SOMEBODY OUT
265,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,HERE THAT WILL PLAY HONORABLY.
266,00:08:11.47,00:08:11.47,SO WE'RE TOGETHER FOR SURE?
267,00:08:12.43,00:08:12.43,FOR SURE.
268,00:08:27.93,00:08:27.93,THIS IS ALL PART OF THE NEW
269,00:08:30.47,00:08:30.47,ERRAV COCHRAN.
270,00:08:31.00,00:08:31.00,IT'S THE COCHRAN THAT CUTS
271,00:08:32.87,00:08:32.87,COCONUTS WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO
272,00:08:33.60,00:08:33.60,DO SO.
273,00:08:36.07,00:08:36.07,MY MOM'S GOING TO HAVE MIXED
274,00:08:38.00,00:08:38.00,FEELINGS ABOUT THE NEW COCHRAN.
275,00:08:40.03,00:08:40.03,SHE'LL BE THRILLED I'M TAKING
276,00:08:41.27,00:08:41.27,INITIATIVE AND DOING WORK BUT
277,00:08:42.77,00:08:42.77,THE FIRST THING SHE SAID WHEN
278,00:08:44.53,00:08:44.53,SHE FOUND OUT I WAS DOING
279,00:08:47.20,00:08:47.20,"SURVIVOR, SHE SAID I DON'T WANT"
280,00:08:48.60,00:08:48.60,YOU TO HANDLE A MACHETE WITHOUT
281,00:08:53.03,00:08:53.03,SUPERVISION.
282,00:08:54.57,00:08:54.57,NEW COCHRAN OPENS A COCONUT BY
283,00:08:56.27,00:08:56.27,HIMSELF AND WITH A MACHETE.
284,00:08:57.97,00:08:57.97,I NEED TO MAKE THEM THINK OF ME
285,00:09:00.23,00:09:00.23,LESS AS THE LIABILITY AND DRAIN
286,00:09:02.00,00:09:02.00,ON THE TRIBE AND MORE AS A
287,00:09:03.70,00:09:03.70,POTENTIAL SURVIVOR.
288,00:09:05.50,00:09:05.50,IT'S GREAT.
289,00:09:06.10,00:09:06.10,PART OF IT IS BECAUSE IT'S THE
290,00:09:07.17,00:09:07.17,FRUIT OF MY LABORS SO IT'S LIKE
291,00:09:08.47,00:09:08.47,A CHILD.
292,00:09:10.50,00:09:10.50,SO I'M DRINKING YOUR CHILD?
293,00:09:12.03,00:09:12.03,I APPRECIATE IT.
294,00:09:13.27,00:09:13.27,IT'S BECOMING PART OF YOU.
295,00:09:14.63,00:09:14.63,I'M CERTAINLY NEVER GOING TO
296,00:09:15.83,00:09:15.83,BECOME THE BIG PROVIDER.
297,00:09:16.60,00:09:16.60,I KNOW I'M NEVER GOING TO BE
298,00:09:18.57,00:09:18.57,OZZY.
299,00:09:18.97,00:09:18.97,I'M NEVER GOING TO BE KEITH.
300,00:09:19.97,00:09:19.97,I'M NEVER GOING TO BE JIM BUT I
301,00:09:20.50,00:09:20.50,CAN AT LEAST BE THE NEW COCHRAN.
302,00:09:21.10,00:09:21.10,BEING PART OF A WELL-OILED
303,00:09:22.93,00:09:22.93,MACHINE IS MORE ENJOYABLE THAT I
304,00:09:24.40,00:09:24.40,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
305,00:09:25.17,00:09:25.17,I'M JUST GOING TO GO DOWN
306,00:09:26.43,00:09:26.43,THERE AND DO A FLOAT-DOWN AND
307,00:09:28.27,00:09:28.27,MAYBE GET LUCKY AND GET
308,00:09:30.57,00:09:30.57,SOMETHING.
309,00:09:32.67,00:09:32.67,I'M PRETTY SURE THE IDOL IS
310,00:09:33.77,00:09:33.77,ALREADY ON THIS BEACH.
311,00:09:35.03,00:09:35.03,WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE YET AT THIS
312,00:09:36.93,00:09:36.93,POINT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
313,00:09:39.13,00:09:39.13,MY EYES PEELED FOR ANY SORT OF
314,00:09:41.23,00:09:41.23,WEIRD SIGN THAT THERE MIGHT BE
315,00:09:44.13,00:09:44.13,IDOL PLACEMENT.
316,00:09:44.80,00:09:44.80,I'M THINKING SOMEWHERE UP IN A
317,00:09:46.40,00:09:46.40,TREE OR MAYBE HIDDEN IN A STUMP
318,00:09:51.13,00:09:51.13,SOMEWHERE.
319,00:09:51.73,00:09:51.73,CAN'T BE TOO SURE.
320,00:09:53.37,00:09:53.37,LET'S GO LOOK BACK THE OTHER
321,00:09:55.73,00:09:55.73,WAY.
322,00:09:56.60,00:09:56.60,LET ME LOOK DOWN IN THERE REAL
323,00:09:58.57,00:09:58.57,QUICK AND GAND SEE WHAT THAT'S
324,00:10:00.13,00:10:00.13,ALL ABOUT.
325,00:10:13.47,00:10:13.47,WHAT'S A ROCK DOING IN THE
326,00:10:14.30,00:10:14.30,MIDDLE OF A TREE?
327,00:10:23.90,00:10:23.90,ME THINKS ME FOUND SOMETHING.
328,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,"THREE TIMES AROUND, YOU START"
329,00:10:30.60,00:10:30.60,LEARNING WHAT TO LOOK FOR.
330,00:10:32.20,00:10:32.20,ROCKS IN TREES ARE A GOOD SIGN
331,00:10:35.87,00:10:35.87,THAT YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING
332,00:10:36.97,00:10:36.97,GOOD!
333,00:10:37.27,00:10:37.27,"OH, THIS IS A GREAT DAY."
334,00:10:40.60,00:10:40.60,FIND ANOTHER HIDING SPOT.
335,00:10:41.77,00:10:41.77,I'VE HAD ONE OF THESE LITTLE
336,00:10:43.57,00:10:43.57,GUYS IN MY POSSESSION BEFORE AND
337,00:10:45.13,00:10:45.13,I WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO THE TO
338,00:10:46.63,00:10:46.63,PLAY IT.
339,00:10:47.97,00:10:47.97,I REALLY SQUANDERED THE
340,00:10:48.90,00:10:48.90,OPPORTUNITY TO GET REALLY FAR
341,00:10:50.13,00:10:50.13,THIS THAT GAME.
342,00:10:50.77,00:10:50.77,I AM SURE AS HELL NOT EVER GOING
343,00:10:52.47,00:10:52.47,TO LET THAT HAPPEN THIS TIME BUT
344,00:10:54.13,00:10:54.13,I CAN'T LET ANYBODY KNOW THAT I
345,00:10:55.33,00:10:55.33,HAVE THE IDOL.
346,00:10:56.57,00:10:56.57,IF ANYBODY SENSES THAT I HAVE
347,00:10:57.67,00:10:57.67,"THE IDOL, THERE'S A VERY STRONG"
348,00:10:59.70,00:10:59.70,POSSIBILITY THAT THEY'RE GOING
349,00:11:00.77,00:11:00.77,TO TRY AND FLUSH IT OUT.
350,00:11:02.40,00:11:02.40,SO IF I CAN MAKE IT TO THE MERGE
351,00:11:04.17,00:11:04.17,AND I COULD USE IT IN AN
352,00:11:06.73,00:11:06.73,"OPPORTUNE MOMENT, THIS MIGHT BE"
353,00:11:07.73,00:11:07.73,MY TICKET TO THE WIN.
354,00:11:23.00,00:11:23.00,HOW YOU FEELING THIS MORNING?
355,00:11:24.57,00:11:24.57,"AWESOME, HOW ABOUT YOU?"
356,00:11:26.10,00:11:26.10,AWESOME.
357,00:11:27.07,00:11:27.07,I TRIED TO CUDDLE UP WITH YOU
358,00:11:29.10,00:11:29.10,"LAST NIGHT, MAN?"
359,00:11:30.27,00:11:30.27,REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED YOU IF YOU
360,00:11:31.47,00:11:31.47,WERE COLD?
361,00:11:31.97,00:11:31.97,NO.
362,00:11:32.33,00:11:32.33,I ASKED YOU.
363,00:11:33.33,00:11:33.33,DID YOU PUT SOMETHING OVER
364,00:11:34.80,00:11:34.80,ME?
365,00:11:34.93,00:11:34.93,YEAH.
366,00:11:35.27,00:11:35.27,"I APPRECIATE THAT, DUDE."
367,00:11:36.80,00:11:36.80,I REALLY LIKE COACH.
368,00:11:37.67,00:11:37.67,I THINK HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY
369,00:11:38.93,00:11:38.93,AND HE'S PLAYED THE GAME TWICE
370,00:11:41.80,00:11:41.80,"WITH HONOR AND INTEGRITY, AND I"
371,00:11:43.27,00:11:43.27,WANT TO PLAY THE SAME WAY.
372,00:11:44.70,00:11:44.70,BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THE
373,00:11:45.90,00:11:45.90,"WHOLE TIME, I'M THINKING TO"
374,00:11:47.57,00:11:47.57,"MYSELF, MAN, HOW, YOU KNOW, HOW"
375,00:11:51.40,00:11:51.40,UNGODLY OR HOW MUCH OF A
376,00:11:52.83,00:11:52.83,HYPOCRITE DO I LOOK LIKE HAVING
377,00:11:54.27,00:11:54.27,MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH COACH AND
378,00:11:55.63,00:11:55.63,HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT I'M
379,00:11:59.17,00:11:59.17,RUSSELL HANTZ' NEPHEW AND IT
380,00:12:01.00,00:12:01.00,JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.
381,00:12:03.70,00:12:03.70,"I'VE KIND OF NOT DONE THAT, MAN."
382,00:12:06.57,00:12:06.57,LYING TO COACH IS TEARING AWAY
383,00:12:08.93,00:12:08.93,AT EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.
384,00:12:10.20,00:12:10.20,AND I'D RATHER PEOPLE KNOW ME
385,00:12:11.67,00:12:11.67,FOR ME.
386,00:12:12.27,00:12:12.27,YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL?
387,00:12:13.57,00:12:13.57,WHAT'S THAT?
388,00:12:15.80,00:12:15.80,"IT SAYS, ""LIL HANTZ."""
389,00:12:19.20,00:12:19.20,THAT'S WHY I WEAR THE SHIRT
390,00:12:21.17,00:12:21.17,ALL THE TIME.
391,00:12:21.83,00:12:21.83,"WAIT, BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR"
392,00:12:23.27,00:12:23.27,"LAST NAME, IS IT?"
393,00:12:23.93,00:12:23.93,"YEAH, I'M RUSSELL HANTZ'S"
394,00:12:27.57,00:12:27.57,NEPHEW.
395,00:12:27.83,00:12:27.83,KEEP THAT ON THE D.L.
396,00:12:28.97,00:12:28.97,SO I TAKE A WALK WITH BRANDON
397,00:12:30.97,00:12:30.97,AND HE TELLS ME THAT HIS UNCLE
398,00:12:34.03,00:12:34.03,IS MY NUMBER ONE NEMESIS RUSSELL
399,00:12:37.70,00:12:37.70,HANTZ.
400,00:12:38.03,00:12:38.03,MY JAW LITERALLY DROPS.
401,00:12:39.63,00:12:39.63,"THAT'S CRAZY, MAN."
402,00:12:40.93,00:12:40.93,"I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE,UN, THIS"
403,00:12:42.80,00:12:42.80,CAN'T BE.
404,00:12:43.47,00:12:43.47,AND THEN I HAD A SINKING FEELING
405,00:12:46.57,00:12:46.57,IN MY STOMACH BECAUSE RUSSELL
406,00:12:47.43,00:12:47.43,"HANTZ TOLD ME AS A MAN OF GOD,"
407,00:12:49.23,00:12:49.23,"AS ACARINE GAPE, WE'RE GOING TO"
408,00:12:50.60,00:12:50.60,PLAY THIS GAME TOGETHER AND HE
409,00:12:51.87,00:12:51.87,VOTE MY ASS OFF THE NEXT TIME HE
410,00:12:54.57,00:12:54.57,COULD SO IT SCARED ME.
411,00:12:57.57,00:12:57.57,"I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, MAN, I"
412,00:13:00.23,00:13:00.23,DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYED A FOOL
413,00:13:01.83,00:13:01.83,TWICE.
414,00:13:02.10,00:13:02.10,I TOOK A HUGE LEAP.
415,00:13:03.80,00:13:03.80,THE ONLY REASON I TOLD YOU IS
416,00:13:04.90,00:13:04.90,BECAUSE I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH
417,00:13:07.00,00:13:07.00,YOU.
418,00:13:07.43,00:13:07.43,IF IT BITES ME IN THE BUTT I
419,00:13:08.80,00:13:08.80,STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT BECAUSE
420,00:13:10.27,00:13:10.27,I LET YOU KNOW.
421,00:13:11.37,00:13:11.37,COACH PLAYED THE GAME WITH MY
422,00:13:12.60,00:13:12.60,UNCLE AND HE GAVE HIM HIS WORD
423,00:13:14.00,00:13:14.00,AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT BUT I
424,00:13:15.60,00:13:15.60,DON'T PLAN ON STACK COACH IN THE
425,00:13:18.13,00:13:18.13,BACK.
426,00:13:18.57,00:13:18.57,MEAS IN MY ALLIANCE AND I'M A

508,00:15:29.97,00:15:29.97,AND HE REALLY DOESN'T SUSPECT
509,00:15:31.07,00:15:31.07,THAT ME AND OZZY WERE ALREADY
510,00:15:34.00,00:15:34.00,TALKING TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS

913,00:27:32.50,00:27:32.50,EDNA IS TOTALLY LOYAL.
914,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,THESE ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

925,00:27:53.03,00:27:53.03,MIKAYLA.
926,00:27:54.70,00:27:54.70,BECAUSE I'M FAITHFUL TO MY WIFE
927,00:27:56.90,00:27:56.90,IT MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
928,00:27:58.00,00:27:58.00,BEING AROUND HER A LOT OF TIMES.
929,00:28:00.27,00:28:00.27,INTERESTING.
930,00:28:04.40,00:28:04.40,"I RESPECT THAT, MAN."
931,00:28:04.80,00:28:04.80,I RESPECT THAT.
932,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,I HAVE A BAD FEELING.
933,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,ALL I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IS
934,00:28:09.03,00:28:09.03,"PARVATI, PARVATI, PARVATI."
935,00:28:10.43,00:28:10.43,SHE SCREWED MANY A MAN.
936,00:28:13.03,00:28:13.03,THAT'S FOR SURE.
937,00:28:14.83,00:28:14.83,"AND BEING STRONG LIKE THAT,"
938,00:28:16.20,00:28:16.20,"LIKE SHE IS, JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M"
939,00:28:18.30,00:28:18.30,"GOING WITH THE TEAM, WHAT'S BEST"
940,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,"FOR US, BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR"
941,00:28:22.80,00:28:22.80,BEST BET.
942,00:28:24.73,00:28:24.73,MIKHAIL'S OUR STRONGEST
943,00:28:25.93,00:28:25.93,FEMALE PLAYER BUT BRANDON HAS A
944,00:28:27.30,00:28:27.30,WIFE AND FAMILY AND I THINK SHE
945,00:28:28.97,00:28:28.97,MAKES HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.
946,00:28:30.57,00:28:30.57,"YOUNG, GOOD-LOOKING GIRL."
947,00:28:32.93,00:28:32.93,I UNDERSTAND.
948,00:28:33.47,00:28:33.47,"BUT TO VOTE HER OFF IMMEDIATELY,"
949,00:28:35.43,00:28:35.43,COME ON.
950,00:28:36.03,00:28:36.03,I JUST THINK THAT HE HAS DEMONS
951,00:28:37.70,00:28:37.70,THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
952,00:28:39.67,00:28:39.67,HE'S FACING ON A DAILY BASIS.
953,00:28:42.97,00:28:42.97,WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT OF
954,00:28:44.57,00:28:44.57,THIS GAME.
955,00:28:45.43,00:28:45.43,SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.
956,00:28:46.80,00:28:46.80,SHE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.
957,00:28:47.80,00:28:47.80,"FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER,"
958,00:28:49.83,00:28:49.83,BRANDON WANTS TO VOTE OUT
959,00:28:51.53,00:28:51.53,MIKAYLA.
960,00:28:51.97,00:28:51.97,I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS DEAL IS.
961,00:28:53.50,00:28:53.50,MAYBE BRANDON IS THREATENED BY
962,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,MIKAYLA BECAUSE SHE'S A STRONG
963,00:28:56.30,00:28:56.30,"WOMAN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT"
964,00:28:58.00,00:28:58.00,WORRIES ME BECAUSE I THINK I'M
965,00:28:59.37,00:28:59.37,QUITE STRONG AS WELL.
966,00:29:00.47,00:29:00.47,WE'RE GOING TO GO--
967,00:29:01.70,00:29:01.70,MIKAYLA.

969,00:29:04.07,00:29:04.07,OUT.
970,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,"TRUTHFULLY, I THINK MIKAYLA"
971,00:29:06.20,00:29:06.20,RIGHT NOW WOULD VOTE CHRISTINE
972,00:29:08.07,00:29:08.07,IF WE TOLD HER TO.
973,00:29:09.53,00:29:09.53,I JUST FEEL IT.
974,00:29:10.30,00:29:10.30,I DO THINK WE NEED HER IN THE
975,00:29:12.73,00:29:12.73,CHALLENGE.
976,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M
977,00:29:14.17,00:29:14.17,THINKING ABOUT.
978,00:29:16.30,00:29:16.30,WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE
979,00:29:19.37,00:29:19.37,TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S MESSED UP
980,00:29:20.53,00:29:20.53,IS EDNA IS OVER THERE WITH NO
981,00:29:22.83,00:29:22.83,PROBLEM.
982,00:29:23.13,00:29:23.13,CHRISTINE IS NOT GOOD IN
983,00:29:24.80,00:29:24.80,CHALLENGES AND MIKAYLA IS.
984,00:29:26.40,00:29:26.40,HERE SHE COMES.
985,00:29:27.60,00:29:27.60,"MIKAYLA, CAN YOU GIVE US A"
986,00:29:30.57,00:29:30.57,LITTLE BIT OF PRIVACY?
987,00:29:32.67,00:29:32.67,"OH, HERE'S STACEY."
988,00:29:33.67,00:29:33.67,I'M JUST GOING TO WALK THIS WAY.
989,00:29:34.93,00:29:34.93,I'M GETTING MY BAG.
990,00:29:36.17,00:29:36.17,I THINK EVERYONE'S PARANOID
991,00:29:37.93,00:29:37.93,RIGHT NOW.
992,00:29:38.93,00:29:38.93,WHAT'S COACH'S DEAL?
993,00:29:42.00,00:29:42.00,COACH IS FLIPPING OUT RIGHT
994,00:29:43.67,00:29:43.67,NOW.
995,00:29:44.17,00:29:44.17,I DON'T THINK HE TRUSTS ANY ONE
996,00:29:44.97,00:29:44.97,OF THE GIRLS RIGHT NOW.
997,00:29:46.17,00:29:46.17,"I DON'T THINK HE TRUSTS YOU,"
998,00:29:48.27,00:29:48.27,"YOU, HER."
999,00:29:48.67,00:29:48.67,IT'S LIKE A MAD SCRAMBLE
1000,00:29:50.13,00:29:50.13,"RIGHT NOW, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN"
1001,00:29:51.73,00:29:51.73,THEY THINK I'M NOT TRUSTABLE.
1002,00:29:53.17,00:29:53.17,"I'M LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"
1003,00:29:54.77,00:29:54.77,I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.
1004,00:29:56.13,00:29:56.13,BUT I'M LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO BE
1005,00:29:57.50,00:29:57.50,KIDDING ME.

1012,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,ABOUT SOPHIE TO BEGIN WITH.
1013,00:30:08.47,00:30:08.47,"NO, SOPHIE WAS OVER THERE,"

1124,00:33:23.87,00:33:23.87,FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
1125,00:33:25.40,00:33:25.40,BRANDON.
1126,00:33:25.80,00:33:25.80,DO YOU THINK YOU MADE A GOOD
1127,00:33:27.17,00:33:27.17,FIRST IMPRESSION ON THIS GROUP?

1134,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,IMPRESSION ON EVERYBODY.

1136,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,THIS GAME A COUPLE OF TIMES.
1137,00:33:42.67,00:33:42.67,WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FIRST
1138,00:33:44.20,00:33:44.20,IMPRESSION OF YOU WAS?
1139,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,AFTER LOSING THE FIRST
1140,00:33:48.10,00:33:48.10,CHALLENGE I THOUGHT MY
1141,00:33:49.20,00:33:49.20,IMPRESSION WAS PRETTY BAD SO
1142,00:33:50.30,00:33:50.30,THERE WAS A LINE BEING DRAWN
1143,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,EARLY ON THAT I FELT.
1144,00:33:57.43,00:33:57.43,AND SO BEFORE WE STARTED WALKING
1145,00:33:59.20,00:33:59.20,"TO TRIBAL TONIGHT, I HAD HEARD"
1146,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,THAT CHRISTINE AND STACEY WANTED
1147,00:34:03.03,00:34:03.03,TO VOTE OUT MIKAYLA.
1148,00:34:07.03,00:34:07.03,AND DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M
1149,00:34:09.67,00:34:09.67,CRAZY BECAUSE COACH IN TRIBAL
1150,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,JUST LAYS EVERYTHING OUT ON THE
1151,00:34:12.63,00:34:12.63,TABLE.

1154,00:34:13.97,00:34:13.97,I DIDN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT
1155,00:34:15.27,00:34:15.27,THAT.

1163,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,NOT TRUE.
1164,00:34:24.77,00:34:24.77,I NEVER MENTIONED MIKAYLA'S
1165,00:34:28.67,00:34:28.67,NAME.
1166,00:34:29.63,00:34:29.63,GO AHEAD.
1167,00:34:31.20,00:34:31.20,WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED.

1212,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,THAT HE CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON.
1213,00:35:40.20,00:35:40.20,"FOR THE RECORD, NOT TO BE"

1215,00:35:44.17,00:35:44.17,TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I DIDN'T TELL
1216,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,COACH YOU WERE VOTING FOR
1217,00:35:48.63,00:35:48.63,ANYBODY BECAUSE YOU NEVER TOLD

1219,00:35:50.87,00:35:50.87,BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO QUESTION
1220,00:35:51.47,00:35:51.47,THE IDEA OF LOYALTY THINK ABOUT

1227,00:36:01.30,00:36:01.30,IDEA OF THE IDOL AND IF SOMEBODY
