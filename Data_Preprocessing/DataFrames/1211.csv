10,00:00:23.54,00:00:23.54,>> PROBST: ...everyone got a glimpse of their loved ones.

15,00:00:36.08,00:00:36.08,and Courtney swung their way to victory.
16,00:00:38.67,00:00:38.67,"Reward for Courtney, Terry, Bruce, and Sally."
17,00:00:43.25,00:00:43.25,You're sending one person to Exile Island.
18,00:00:45.04,00:00:45.04,Who is it going to be? >> Aras.
19,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,">> PROBST: On Exile Island, Aras's search for the idol was"
20,00:00:51.54,00:00:51.54,futile. >> Terry's quickness to send me
21,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17,might suggest that there is no immunity idol out here.
22,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33,>> PROBST: The immunity challenge began with a twist.
23,00:01:00.25,00:01:00.25,"If immunity is just not that important to you, you don't have"
24,00:01:03.88,00:01:03.88,to take part in today's challenge.
25,00:01:05.96,00:01:05.96,"Instead, you can chow down. >> Doh!"
26,00:01:10.67,00:01:10.67,">> PROBST: Aras, Terry, and Sally passed on the offer and"
27,00:01:13.58,00:01:13.58,"went head to head for immunity, while the rest of the tribe"
28,00:01:16.83,00:01:16.83,gorged themselves on cheeseburgers.
29,00:01:18.88,00:01:18.88,>> Here you go. >> PROBST: Terry wins immunity
30,00:01:20.88,00:01:20.88,for the third straight time! >> Yes!
31,00:01:26.42,00:01:26.42,">> PROBST: Before Tribal Council, the Casaya members were"
32,00:01:29.25,00:01:29.25,unified. >> So we go Sally six-nothing
33,00:01:31.42,00:01:31.42,tonight? >> PROBST: But the threat of
34,00:01:33.17,00:01:33.17,Terry giving the immunity idol to Sally made Aras vulnerable.
35,00:01:36.88,00:01:36.88,>> It's possible that I could go home today.
36,00:01:39.21,00:01:39.21,"If Sally ends up having the hidden immunity idol, then Sally"
37,00:01:42.38,00:01:42.38,and Terry's vote will knock somebody out.
38,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,">> PROBST: But at Tribal Council, Terry strategically"
39,00:01:48.25,00:01:48.25,"kept the hidden immunity idol, and his last ally, Sally, was"
40,00:01:51.79,00:01:51.79,voted out of the tribe. Seven are left.
41,00:01:55.17,00:01:55.17,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
42,00:02:32.58,00:02:32.58,>> Sally voted out last night at Tribal Council means that I'm
43,00:02:35.88,00:02:35.88,the only one left from La Mina. I still have a huge target on
44,00:02:39.04,00:02:39.04,"my back, and at the Tribal Council, and after feeling"
45,00:02:43.21,00:02:43.21,"melancholy sitting around the fire and having them ask me,"
46,00:02:46.54,00:02:46.54,"""Oh, is there something wrong? You want to talk about it?"""
47,00:02:48.79,00:02:48.79,"I'm like, of course there's something wrong, you know."
48,00:02:51.67,00:02:51.67,"And, no, I don't want to talk about it."
49,00:02:53.58,00:02:53.58,"I'm bummed. >> Come a long way, baby."
50,00:03:00.08,00:03:00.08,>> I know. >> It's a good feeling.
51,00:03:04.46,00:03:04.46,">> I'm going to have to win every one in from now on, at"
52,00:03:08.17,00:03:08.17,"least the next three out of four to get to the four, and then"
53,00:03:12.21,00:03:12.21,I've got my hidden immunity idol.
54,00:03:14.92,00:03:14.92,"That will get me by that, if I I need to, to get to the final"
55,00:03:17.21,00:03:17.21,three. I kind of feel that once I get
56,00:03:19.46,00:03:19.46,"to the final three, I think I've got it over everybody here as"
57,00:03:22.25,00:03:22.25,far as mental power and strength.
58,00:03:26.08,00:03:26.08,">> Oh, no! >> Oh, Shane!"
59,00:03:29.58,00:03:29.58,"Damn! >> You guy, can you help me?"
60,00:03:33.12,00:03:33.12,Grab another thing or do something?
61,00:03:35.38,00:03:35.38,">> Courtney, chill out, dude! Relax!"
62,00:03:37.92,00:03:37.92,Don't yell at me like that! >> I wasn't yelling.
63,00:03:40.12,00:03:40.12,"I just wanted... >> I know, but I didn't have"
64,00:03:42.00,00:03:42.00,anything in my hands. >> Relax. I'm sorry.
65,00:03:48.33,00:03:48.33,>> What is going to be interesting now is the longer I
66,00:03:50.33,00:03:50.33,"hang out, the longer I get to see how they end up turning on"
67,00:03:53.25,00:03:53.25,one another. >> Ridiculous.
68,00:03:56.04,00:03:56.04,>> The one good thing that I had going for me as far as the
69,00:03:59.25,00:03:59.25,Tribal Councils recently is I didn't have to vote against my
70,00:04:02.25,00:04:02.25,"tribe mates. There wasn't any of that, where"
71,00:04:05.08,00:04:05.08,these guys are going to have to turn on one another.
72,00:04:07.46,00:04:07.46,And I hope I'm the fly on the wall.
73,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67,">> My stomach really hurts. >> You guys both are, like..."
74,00:04:18.25,00:04:18.25,that's horrible. >> It's difficult just to stand.
75,00:04:28.38,00:04:28.38,We have to drink water. >> I remember being so
76,00:04:30.42,00:04:30.42,"constipated, I thought I was having a..."
77,00:04:32.58,00:04:32.58,">> A child? >> No, I thought I was having"
78,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,a... >> Appendicitis?
79,00:04:36.12,00:04:36.12,>> That's it. I thought I was having
80,00:04:37.21,00:04:37.21,"appendicitis, it was that bad. >> It's hard."
81,00:04:40.21,00:04:40.21,"My stomach is so bloated it hurts, and I haven't gone to the"
82,00:04:45.21,00:04:45.21,bathroom since just before the Panamanian village feast.
83,00:04:52.83,00:04:52.83,"It's just-- I was blocked up and it's very, very, very painful."
84,00:05:02.00,00:05:02.00,">> Yeah, we all have boxes with our names on them."
85,00:05:08.42,00:05:08.42,">> Oh, my God! >> ""A doll represents each of"
86,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,"you. It needs a bit of your hair,"
87,00:05:16.12,00:05:16.12,"your clothes, your heart. Give it some of your personality"
88,00:05:19.12,00:05:19.12,and you're off to a good start. How well you've observed your
89,00:05:22.04,00:05:22.04,"surroundings could help rejuvenate you for a while,"
90,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,"but if you've lived with blinders on, you may find"
91,00:05:27.12,00:05:27.12,"yourself in Exile."" >> Oh."
92,00:05:34.04,00:05:34.04,>> It's so cute. >> We got these dolls and we're
93,00:05:39.12,00:05:39.12,supposed to make them in our likeness.
94,00:05:42.38,00:05:42.38,They're basically almost there. >> How fun is that?
95,00:05:47.75,00:05:47.75,>> I'm trying to help my doll out here in giving her just the
96,00:05:53.08,00:05:53.08,"right amount of curves, so she looks more like myself."
97,00:05:59.67,00:05:59.67,"Shane, is that about right? (Cirie laughing)"
98,00:06:05.04,00:06:05.04,I actually like the blouse. >> What do you think?
99,00:06:09.17,00:06:09.17,"Does it look like me, Cirie? >> Oh, my God, twins."
100,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,"(Cirie laughing) >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
101,00:06:29.54,00:06:29.54,"All right, for today's challenge, we're going to see"
102,00:06:33.08,00:06:33.08,how well you know the people you've been living with for the
103,00:06:36.21,00:06:36.21,past 25 days. I have a series of questions.
104,00:06:39.21,00:06:39.21,Each of you is going to fill out these questions and answer these
105,00:06:42.67,00:06:42.67,questions in private. I'll then tally the results;
106,00:06:45.96,00:06:45.96,"we'll get to the challenge. You can leave your voodoo dolls,"
107,00:06:48.12,00:06:48.12,"find a spot, fill them out, and I'll tally them up."
108,00:07:00.21,00:07:00.21,"Okay, I've tallied the results. Now I'm going to ask you these"
109,00:07:03.58,00:07:03.58,questions again. This time when I ask you the
110,00:07:06.12,00:07:06.12,"question, you're trying to guess whose name came up most often."
111,00:07:10.58,00:07:10.58,It's not necessarily who you voted for.
112,00:07:12.50,00:07:12.50,It's who you think everybody else voted for.
113,00:07:15.04,00:07:15.04,"There's a difference. Each time you get one right, you"
114,00:07:17.83,00:07:17.83,get to chop another tribe member's rope.
115,00:07:20.96,00:07:20.96,"Each time you chop a rope, you release a torch."
116,00:07:23.25,00:07:23.25,"After three chops, the voodoo doll will go up in flames."
117,00:07:27.92,00:07:27.92,That person is out of the challenge.
118,00:07:29.79,00:07:29.79,The last person left standing wins reward.
119,00:07:32.25,00:07:32.25,I know you want to know what you're playing for.
120,00:07:34.21,00:07:34.21,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: The winner of today's
121,00:07:36.21,00:07:36.21,challenge will leave here via helicopter to a very nice spa.
122,00:07:40.21,00:07:40.21,"You'll get a shower, we'll wash those clothes, get a mud"
123,00:07:43.29,00:07:43.29,"massage. Then you will eat chicken, beef,"
124,00:07:46.00,00:07:46.00,"fish, pork chops. >> Ah..."
125,00:07:48.00,00:07:48.00,>> Man. >> PROBST: You'll spend the
126,00:07:49.58,00:07:49.58,"night, return to camp in the morning."
127,00:07:51.33,00:07:51.33,Worth playing for? >> Yeah.
128,00:07:53.25,00:07:53.25,">> PROBST: In addition, the winner of today's challenge will"
129,00:07:55.29,00:07:55.29,decide who is sent to Exile Island.
130,00:08:00.46,00:08:00.46,"All right, everybody has their answer board."
131,00:08:02.58,00:08:02.58,First question-- it's going to be fun-- who does the least for
132,00:08:09.04,00:08:09.04,"the tribe? Again, you're trying to guess"
133,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,"whose name came up most often to the question ""Who does the"
134,00:08:14.88,00:08:14.88,"least for the tribe?"" All right, reveal."
135,00:08:18.08,00:08:18.08,"Courtney and Danielle say Bruce. You're not right, take a step"
136,00:08:21.38,00:08:21.38,back. Bruce says Courtney.
137,00:08:22.92,00:08:22.92,You're not right. Danielle is the correct answer.
138,00:08:25.54,00:08:25.54,"Cirie, Aras, Terry, Shane all got it right."
139,00:08:29.17,00:08:29.17,"Take a step forward. All right, Cirie, take the first"
140,00:08:32.25,00:08:32.25,shot. Who is she going to hit?
141,00:08:34.21,00:08:34.21,Cirie going to do the first damage.
142,00:08:38.21,00:08:38.21,Terry takes his first hit. (Terry scoffs)
143,00:08:40.33,00:08:40.33,"Aras, you're up. Aras heading straight to Terry."
144,00:08:46.54,00:08:46.54,Terry takes his second hit. Terry now has two people to get
145,00:08:49.88,00:08:49.88,"even with, only one hit. With some gusto, he takes Aras"
146,00:08:54.04,00:08:54.04,out. This game's getting real
147,00:08:56.04,00:08:56.04,interesting. Shane can put Terry out of this
148,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,or inflict some pain on someone else.
149,00:09:01.92,00:09:01.92,"Just like that, Terry is out of the challenge, takes a seat on"
150,00:09:05.29,00:09:05.29,"the bench. Can't be a big surprise for you,"
151,00:09:09.08,00:09:09.08,coming into this challenge. Terry not talking at all.
152,00:09:12.29,00:09:12.29,Next question: who never shuts up?
153,00:09:17.75,00:09:17.75,Keep your answers to yourself. Everybody reveal.
154,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,"A lot of Terrys, one Bruce, but the name you actually wrote down"
155,00:09:25.25,00:09:25.25,"the most: Courtney. Cirie has it right, Shane has it"
156,00:09:29.08,00:09:29.08,"right. >> Oh, wow."
157,00:09:30.38,00:09:30.38,">> PROBST: Take a step forward. Shane, take your shot."
158,00:09:34.29,00:09:34.29,Going down to the end. Bruce takes his first hit.
159,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,"Cirie. >> Sorry, Bruce."
160,00:09:40.83,00:09:40.83,>> It's okay. >> PROBST: Cirie gives Bruce his
161,00:09:42.88,00:09:42.88,second hit. Bruce now down to one rope left.
162,00:09:45.83,00:09:45.83,Next question: who mistakenly believes they are running this
163,00:09:49.96,00:09:49.96,game? This should be very interesting.
164,00:09:53.83,00:09:53.83,Reveal. The correct answer: Shane.
165,00:09:59.46,00:09:59.46,Courtney has it right. Aras has it right.
166,00:10:01.83,00:10:01.83,"Shane, obvious question: news to you?"
167,00:10:03.88,00:10:03.88,>> I do not perceive to think that I'm running the game.
168,00:10:06.71,00:10:06.71,">> PROBST: Aras, take your shot. Clear pecking order being"
169,00:10:08.96,00:10:08.96,established. Bruce is out of the game.
170,00:10:11.25,00:10:11.25,"Take a seat on the bench next to Terry, Bruce."
171,00:10:14.88,00:10:14.88,"Courtney, make your move. >> I'll go for this one."
172,00:10:18.67,00:10:18.67,>> PROBST: Courtney gives Shane his first hit.
173,00:10:21.21,00:10:21.21,"That was a rough round for you, Shane."
174,00:10:23.08,00:10:23.08,(Cirie snickering) Next question: Who would you
175,00:10:26.00,00:10:26.00,"trust with your life? Remember, you're trying to guess"
176,00:10:29.25,00:10:29.25,what the group thought as a whole.
177,00:10:31.25,00:10:31.25,Everybody reveal. Cirie says Bruce.
178,00:10:34.25,00:10:34.25,Cirie did not vote for herself. That's too bad.
179,00:10:37.58,00:10:37.58,"""Cirie""  was the right answer. Aras is the only one that got it"
180,00:10:40.17,00:10:40.17,"right. How does that feel, Cirie?"
181,00:10:42.33,00:10:42.33,">> Thanks, guys. (giggling)"
182,00:10:45.50,00:10:45.50,">> PROBST: Make your move, Aras. Setting down."
183,00:10:48.25,00:10:48.25,Courtney takes her first hit. Next question: Who would you
184,00:10:52.08,00:10:52.08,not trust to watch your back? The correct answer is Terry.
185,00:10:57.38,00:10:57.38,Courtney has it right. Aras has it right.
186,00:11:00.62,00:11:00.62,"Courtney, you're up. Danielle takes her first hit."
187,00:11:04.67,00:11:04.67,Aras. Aras gives Cirie her first hit.
188,00:11:10.12,00:11:10.12,We are even up. Everybody down to two ropes.
189,00:11:13.71,00:11:13.71,Who is the biggest poseur? Somebody's feelings are about

194,00:11:28.25,00:11:28.25,"Aras, take your hit. Danielle now down to her last"
195,00:11:32.67,00:11:32.67,rope. Next question: Who is the
196,00:11:35.58,00:11:35.58,moodiest? The correct answer: Shane.
197,00:11:40.25,00:11:40.25,"Courtney got it right, and Aras, again, got it right."
198,00:11:42.75,00:11:42.75,"Courtney, you're up. Shane takes his second hit."

200,00:11:48.12,00:11:48.12,Your life is changing. >> PROBST: Except for the fact
201,00:11:50.08,00:11:50.08,you aren't really running the game.
202,00:11:51.71,00:11:51.71,">> No, I'm talking about  Courtney."
203,00:11:53.12,00:11:53.12,"You're in the wrong team. >> Give me a break, dude."
204,00:11:55.21,00:11:55.21,We're playing a game. >> A helicopter game with a spa

206,00:12:00.08,00:12:00.08,>> Why would you hit me twice? >> 'Cause I didn't know...
207,00:12:02.17,00:12:02.17,">> Guys, guys, let's rise above it."
208,00:12:04.46,00:12:04.46,This game is meant to splinter us.
209,00:12:06.25,00:12:06.25,"Rise above it. Come on now. >> Yeah, it's meant to splinter"
210,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,you guys. Come on.

215,00:12:23.88,00:12:23.88,Shane down to his last rope. Next question: Who most easily
216,00:12:27.25,00:12:27.25,"succumbs to intimidation? Courtney, at the last minute,"
217,00:12:31.79,00:12:31.79,you changed yours. What did you have before that?
218,00:12:33.75,00:12:33.75,>> Myself. >> PROBST: You were right the
219,00:12:35.17,00:12:35.17,first time. Courtney is the right answer.
220,00:12:37.04,00:12:37.04,"Shane got it right. >> Yeah, I wonder who he's going"
221,00:12:39.25,00:12:39.25,to hit. >> Who do you think I'm going

225,00:12:49.62,00:12:49.62,(Cirie snickering) Everybody says Courtney except
226,00:12:52.79,00:12:52.79,"Courtney. Obviously, you're surprised."
227,00:12:55.25,00:12:55.25,>> By being the right answer for everything? Yeah.
228,00:12:57.75,00:12:57.75,(Cirie stifling giggles) It makes me feel great.
229,00:13:00.12,00:13:00.12,">> PROBST: Aras, you're up. And with that, Courtney takes"
230,00:13:04.50,00:13:04.50,her third hit. >> Horrible.
231,00:13:06.79,00:13:06.79,>> PROBST: Courtney's out of the game and probably happy to be
232,00:13:08.67,00:13:08.67,"out of the game. >> Well, I'm sure I'll be the"
233,00:13:10.67,00:13:10.67,right answer to everything else today.

241,00:13:32.33,00:13:32.33,>> Because I promised Aras I wouldn't hit him.

250,00:13:54.83,00:13:54.83,>> It's all good. I want to go on a jet and fly
251,00:13:56.25,00:13:56.25,and eat a sandwich. It's all good.
252,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,>> PROBST: Here's where we stand: Cirie has two ropes
253,00:14:01.79,00:14:01.79,"left; Aras, you have one. That means if Cirie gets this"

255,00:14:07.04,00:14:07.04,>> It's over. Right. Next question: Who would never

258,00:14:22.04,00:14:22.04,to do. Takes a long time to make her
259,00:14:24.25,00:14:24.25,decision. Did she get it right?
260,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,Reveal. Aras says Terry.
261,00:14:30.46,00:14:30.46,Cirie says herself. The correct answer is Cirie.
262,00:14:34.29,00:14:34.29,Cirie got it right. Cirie wins this challenge.
263,00:14:37.12,00:14:37.12,Make your last hit. (applauding and cheering)
264,00:14:39.96,00:14:39.96,">> Did you do that on purpose, Aras?"
265,00:14:42.00,00:14:42.00,>> Me? I don't think you could survive a day in the wilderness.
266,00:14:44.67,00:14:44.67,">> Sorry, Aras. >> PROBST: And with that, Cirie"

272,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,"I... Terry, sorry. >> PROBST: Terry, for a third"
273,00:15:05.00,00:15:05.00,"time, going back to Exile Island."
274,00:15:07.08,00:15:07.08,Did you expect that? >> I've come to expect all bad
275,00:15:09.08,00:15:09.08,"things for right now, Jeff, until, uh, something changes."
276,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,">> Sorry. >> PROBST: Head on out, Terry."

279,00:15:23.42,00:15:23.42,food. You're bringing two people with
280,00:15:25.58,00:15:25.58,you... (Cirie sighs)
281,00:15:27.04,00:15:27.04,>> PROBST: ...which means you are leaving three people behind.
282,00:15:29.83,00:15:29.83,>> Oh... >> PROBST: You've already sent
283,00:15:31.96,00:15:31.96,one person to Exile. Who's the first person?
284,00:15:36.00,00:15:36.00,"Shane is on his knees begging. >> Oh, Cirie!"
285,00:15:38.79,00:15:38.79,>> I promised Aras since day one.
286,00:15:41.42,00:15:41.42,"I'm sorry! >> PROBST: Aras, head over."
287,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,>> I promised. I gotta keep a promise.
288,00:15:50.83,00:15:50.83,Oh... >> PROBST: One more person going
289,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,with you. The other three going back to
290,00:15:55.38,00:15:55.38,Gitanos camp. >> First.
291,00:15:58.46,00:15:58.46,">> We talked about this, Cirie. We already talked about this."
292,00:16:01.08,00:16:01.08,">> She promised. >> We did, Shane, but it was"
293,00:16:03.04,00:16:03.04,after Danielle. >> PROBST: Danielle is your
294,00:16:05.00,00:16:05.00,choice? >> I'm sorry. Yes.
295,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,"Sorry, Shane, I'm sorry. >> You are sorry."
296,00:16:13.00,00:16:13.00,Devastating. >> Aras promised me since day
297,00:16:15.08,00:16:15.08,"one, day one, if he ever won, he would take me."
298,00:16:18.12,00:16:18.12,">> I'm not worried about Aras. >> So, I mean..."
299,00:16:20.08,00:16:20.08,>> I'm worried about the Danielle call.
300,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,I think that you made the wrong call.
301,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,>> Okay. >> Thanks.
302,00:16:25.38,00:16:25.38,">> Have fun. >> PROBST: All right, guys,"
303,00:16:28.00,00:16:28.00,helicopter waiting for you down on the beach.
304,00:16:41.54,00:16:41.54,"Bruce, Courtney, Shane, rough afternoon."
305,00:16:44.21,00:16:44.21,I got nothing to make it any better.
306,00:16:46.04,00:16:46.04,"Get your stuff, head on back to camp."
307,00:16:59.12,00:16:59.12,>> This is amazing! >> We're doing it!
308,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50,"We're in a helicopter! >> Oh, yeah."
309,00:17:04.08,00:17:04.08,(laughter) >> Look at this.
310,00:17:17.04,00:17:17.04,>> Oh... my... God! >> Ha-ha.
311,00:17:19.21,00:17:19.21,>> This is going to be the best night of my life.
312,00:17:21.21,00:17:21.21,">> Oh, my God Honestly, I'm so happy."
313,00:17:23.21,00:17:23.21,>> I'm not kidding. >> I have never been in a
314,00:17:26.21,00:17:26.21,helicopter before. It's almost like I was alone
315,00:17:28.67,00:17:28.67,"flying above this place, getting to see all of this"
316,00:17:33.38,00:17:33.38,stuff that I would never in a lifetime... on my own be able to
317,00:17:36.79,00:17:36.79,see. Oh... my... God!
318,00:17:43.54,00:17:43.54,I picked Aras and Danielle because they were the people
319,00:17:46.88,00:17:46.88,that I thought I would have the most fun with.
320,00:17:49.83,00:17:49.83,"But this could potentially be, like, a fatal move for me."
321,00:17:52.96,00:17:52.96,I'm probably public enemy #1 now because I didn't take the
322,00:17:55.50,00:17:55.50,people who are back at camp. >> What is on this plate?!
323,00:18:00.04,00:18:00.04,"God, I'm so happy! (Cirie chuckling)"
324,00:18:03.29,00:18:03.29,"I'm going to lean back. You guys, relax, relax."
325,00:18:06.21,00:18:06.21,There's so much food. >> Mmm...
326,00:18:09.71,00:18:09.71,>> I had fun at that challenge. I laughed so much.
327,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,">> I did, too, but it wasn't fun in the end."
328,00:18:15.58,00:18:15.58,"Man, they put Courtney as the most annoying."
329,00:18:18.08,00:18:18.08,"Wow. >> She got that, too?"
330,00:18:20.08,00:18:20.08,>> Mm-hmm. >> She and Cirie did.
331,00:18:22.08,00:18:22.08,She cleaned up today. >> You should have seen her
332,00:18:25.08,00:18:25.08,face. >> That's why I couldn't stop
333,00:18:27.25,00:18:27.25,"laughing 'cause it was so funny. I mean, I would be kind of"
334,00:18:29.92,00:18:29.92,pissed if my tribe members thought that I was the most
335,00:18:33.38,00:18:33.38,annoying. (stifled laughter)
336,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,"Oh, my gosh. I would have felt the same way."
337,00:18:45.96,00:18:45.96,">> I've always thought that me, Aras, and Cirie were tight in a"
338,00:18:49.83,00:18:49.83,"three-way thing, and today, I don't know."
339,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,"Like, I got to ask myself where Cirie is with Danielle."
340,00:18:55.58,00:18:55.58,"And so, I was pretty shocked that she didn't pick me today,"
341,00:18:57.62,00:18:57.62,"for sure. >> Well, that was fun."
342,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,You get to know where you stand. >> I had no idea Danielle and
343,00:19:08.08,00:19:08.08,Cirie were that close. >> I don't care about that.
344,00:19:12.83,00:19:12.83,I care about the game. And what you said about me.
345,00:19:16.88,00:19:16.88,>> You do? >> Are you kidding?
346,00:19:21.12,00:19:21.12,Can you just think for a second how that would make you feel?
347,00:19:25.46,00:19:25.46,I'm sure you didn't pay attention to how many answers I
348,00:19:28.92,00:19:28.92,"was the answer to, but... >> I think you're also"
349,00:19:30.92,00:19:30.92,personalizing a lot of it. >> How can I not be...
350,00:19:34.25,00:19:34.25,"opinion about me? >> No, but some of the questions"
351,00:19:36.25,00:19:36.25,were stupid. Who is the most annoying?
352,00:19:39.42,00:19:39.42,"That one might not be fun, but..."
353,00:19:41.92,00:19:41.92,">> It's hurtful. I just got, like, I was so"
354,00:19:45.58,00:19:45.58,"happy to be here, like, yesterday."
355,00:19:47.38,00:19:47.38,"Now I'm, like... I don't want to be here."
356,00:19:53.79,00:19:53.79,I'm going to have to live with this for the rest of my life.
357,00:19:57.21,00:19:57.21,>> Courtney destroyed herself today.
358,00:19:59.79,00:19:59.79,"I mean, she takes a lot of stuff personally, anyway, and just to"
359,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,"hear the, like, some of the answers to what the tribe thinks"
360,00:20:06.42,00:20:06.42,"about her is just, I think really got her in an all-time"
361,00:20:10.08,00:20:10.08,low. (coughing)
362,00:20:14.67,00:20:14.67,"You know, the common voice of the tribe was heard today, you"
363,00:20:17.04,00:20:17.04,know? She got a lot of bombs dropped
364,00:20:19.83,00:20:19.83,"on her today, so it's gonna be very interesting to see how she"
365,00:20:22.08,00:20:22.08,handles herself for the next few days.
366,00:20:37.21,00:20:37.21,">> Yeah, Bud? >> Bruce has been in pain for"
367,00:20:53.62,00:20:53.62,"the last few days, and it started to really sort of double"
368,00:20:57.21,00:20:57.21,"and triple up, I think. >> I've had so many weird"
369,00:21:00.00,00:21:00.00,injuries. Tons of horrible injuries and
370,00:21:02.71,00:21:02.71,injuries. This is one of the most painful.
371,00:21:07.29,00:21:07.29,But... it's part of the game. >> His stomach has been
372,00:21:10.92,00:21:10.92,"bothering him for the last ten to 12 days, and it's been a"
373,00:21:12.75,00:21:12.75,"matter of him not being able, really, to go to the bathroom."
374,00:21:15.54,00:21:15.54,"And at times, Bruce can tend to be overdramatic, but there was"
375,00:21:17.96,00:21:17.96,nothing overdramatic about what was happening.
376,00:21:20.58,00:21:20.58,He was in a lot of pain. (groans)
377,00:21:28.25,00:21:28.25,">> My whole back, all my stomach, everything, my whole"
378,00:21:31.08,00:21:31.08,inter... hurts so bad every second.
379,00:21:35.75,00:21:35.75,"And this, the pain is just increasing."
380,00:21:39.12,00:21:39.12,"So painful. >> Yo, you got to get better"
381,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,'cause we need you. (groaning)
382,00:21:48.25,00:21:48.25,>> I'm just concerned 'cause it's escalating so fast.
383,00:21:55.25,00:21:55.25,(groans) (Cirie moans)
384,00:22:02.25,00:22:02.25,">> Ooh! Thank you, God, for letting"
385,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,"me get this one. If I don't win anything else,"
386,00:22:08.92,00:22:08.92,"thank you, God. Whoo! We got a mud massage."
387,00:22:14.96,00:22:14.96,"That is wonderful. It was like ""Lifetimes of the"
388,00:22:17.12,00:22:17.12,"Rich & Famous."" I felt like Robin Leach."
389,00:22:21.71,00:22:21.71,"Well, Danielle, is this something for your first"
390,00:22:23.50,00:22:23.50,"massage? >> Oh, good."
391,00:22:26.88,00:22:26.88,The man that gave me a massage was pretty rough 'cause I've
392,00:22:29.83,00:22:29.83,"never had a professional massage done, but I usually like to be"
393,00:22:33.00,00:22:33.00,massaged a little bit easier. Aah!
394,00:22:37.17,00:22:37.17,">> Danielle picked the guy. >> Oh, boy."
395,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,">> She figured he'd have stronger hands, and he did."
396,00:22:42.96,00:22:42.96,">> Holy snakies. >> Wow. Oh, my gosh."
397,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17,>> Do I have another stomach? (laughter)
398,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,That's it. Maybe one more bite.
399,00:23:10.17,00:23:10.17,>> Today is almost like I'm starting over.
400,00:23:13.33,00:23:13.33,"If I'm out of the game because of this, at least I got to do"
401,00:23:16.08,00:23:16.08,this before I went because this is great.
402,00:23:20.12,00:23:20.12,>> I think that game officially pointed out the immaturity of
403,00:23:23.25,00:23:23.25,"our group. Courtney, her and Shane, man,"
404,00:23:26.75,00:23:26.75,they are so similar. >> They are.
405,00:23:29.12,00:23:29.12,">> She has a serious crush on him, I think."
406,00:23:32.12,00:23:32.12,>> A total crush on him. >> And the thing is with
407,00:23:35.04,00:23:35.04,"Courtney, is she just wants to be wanted."
408,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,"Like, that's her psychological pattern, and so she loves it"
409,00:23:40.71,00:23:40.71,when Shane engages her in those arguments about her being
410,00:23:44.21,00:23:44.21,"passive-aggressive. Even though she'll, like, walk"
411,00:23:46.25,00:23:46.25,"away and be angry, she knows that there's going to be a"
412,00:23:48.08,00:23:48.08,makeup point. >> I can imagine the arguments
413,00:23:50.33,00:23:50.33,they're going to have tonight-- Courtney and Shane.
414,00:23:52.71,00:23:52.71,You know they've been arguing since they got back.
415,00:23:55.12,00:23:55.12,">> Poor Bruce, he's right there smack-dab in the middle."
416,00:23:57.04,00:23:57.04,>> And he's hurting. >> Poor Bruce.
417,00:23:59.04,00:23:59.04,>> I'm going to be so not liked tomorrow.
418,00:24:01.38,00:24:01.38,>> I like you. >> I love you.
419,00:24:04.25,00:24:04.25,(laughter) (Bruce groaning)
420,00:24:26.92,00:24:26.92,(groaning) >> Uh-oh.
421,00:24:40.42,00:24:40.42,>> It's been doubling and escalating so fast since I got
422,00:24:44.54,00:24:44.54,back. (groans)
423,00:24:47.83,00:24:47.83,>> Can I sing you a song. Will that help?
424,00:24:52.17,00:24:52.17,>> No. It's going to be okay.
425,00:24:57.17,00:24:57.17,\xe2\x99\xaa Just take me away... \xe2\x99\xaa >> Bruce had really horrible
426,00:25:11.50,00:25:11.50,stomach pains. He's had pains for about four
427,00:25:14.42,00:25:14.42,"days now, and it just got really unbearable for him."
428,00:25:19.38,00:25:19.38,"And I went in there, was trying to calm him down 'cause he"
429,00:25:22.96,00:25:22.96,"was just like, literally like writhing and convulsing in"
430,00:25:26.04,00:25:26.04,"pain, and he was just begging for the medics to get here, so"
431,00:25:29.75,00:25:29.75,the medic had to be called. >> I don't want to quit.
432,00:25:35.04,00:25:35.04,>> Huh? >> I don't want to quit.
433,00:25:37.54,00:25:37.54,I just want to get well. (groans)
434,00:25:44.08,00:25:44.08,(motor rumbling) >> Aw...
435,00:25:59.92,00:25:59.92,>> Bruce? (Bruce groans)
436,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,>> Hi. >> Hi. How you doing?
437,00:26:04.12,00:26:04.12,>> It gets worse; it just escalates so bad.
438,00:26:06.75,00:26:06.75,(groans) >> Talk to me.
439,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,Whereabouts is the pain? >> All over my back and stomach
440,00:26:12.79,00:26:12.79,but... (groans) It's just getting worse.
441,00:26:15.96,00:26:15.96,">> Bruce, are you allergic to anything?"
442,00:26:23.25,00:26:23.25,">> No, injuries-- tons of them. (Bruce groans)"
443,00:26:33.21,00:26:33.21,>> Brain has been hurting for hours.
444,00:26:36.88,00:26:36.88,"Oh, God... Oh, God, it hurts so much."
445,00:26:41.21,00:26:41.21,">> All right, lift your head up for a minute."
446,00:26:45.42,00:26:45.42,Just going to unbutton your shirt here.
447,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,>> It's not fair. (Bruce yells)
448,00:26:54.17,00:26:54.17,">> Okay... >> Don't, don't, don't."
449,00:27:03.38,00:27:03.38,">> (groaning): All right. Aah, I've been in pain so long."
450,00:27:07.58,00:27:07.58,(panting) Don't miss.
451,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,(groaning) >> I can't touch...
452,00:27:23.29,00:27:23.29,"Oh, give me some relief, please. >> What I want you to do is hold"
453,00:27:28.83,00:27:28.83,"this to your mouth and breathe in and out, just nice smooth"
454,00:27:31.33,00:27:31.33,"breaths. (coughs, groans)"
455,00:27:34.00,00:27:34.00,>> That's it. >> My stomach hurts so much--
456,00:27:37.12,00:27:37.12,"it's increasing. >> Ow, ow..."
457,00:28:08.29,00:28:08.29,>> I'm going to need you guys to help me carry the stretcher.
458,00:28:10.54,00:28:10.54,I'm just going to go out to the boat and head back to base camp
459,00:28:12.79,00:28:12.79,and I'll reassess him there. I think we've got his pain under
460,00:28:15.71,00:28:15.71,"control, and all his vital signs..."
461,00:28:17.75,00:28:17.75,>> Okay. Did you give him a shot?
462,00:28:21.54,00:28:21.54,">> Uh, do we need to do this right this second?"
463,00:28:24.54,00:28:24.54,">> Yes, we do. >> Bruce, what I'm gonna get you"
464,00:28:34.21,00:28:34.21,to do... You move towards me.
465,00:28:41.29,00:28:41.29,"I'm not gonna move you. Here, I'll give you help."
466,00:28:44.46,00:28:44.46,Lift that foot up. There you go.
467,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,...so you roll back down. (Bruce groans)
468,00:28:51.54,00:28:51.54,>> Just... on your side a bit there.
469,00:28:54.08,00:28:54.08,Just nice and slow. Do you want to use my hand?
470,00:28:57.54,00:28:57.54,">> Ow... >> It's going to be all right,"
471,00:28:59.88,00:28:59.88,Bruce. (groans)
472,00:29:04.17,00:29:04.17,>> I'm going to pull it. Everyone's going to follow him
473,00:29:07.25,00:29:07.25,"all the way. Lift up, nice and gently, that's"
474,00:29:10.25,00:29:10.25,"it. >> Bruce, we'll see you really"
475,00:29:21.88,00:29:21.88,"soon. >> Steady, and stop there."
476,00:29:25.46,00:29:25.46,"(indistinct orders) >> Love you, Bruce."
477,00:29:35.17,00:29:35.17,">> See you in a minute, Brucey. (Bruce groaning)"
478,00:29:42.12,00:29:42.12,(boat engine rumbles) >> Back...
479,00:29:45.25,00:29:45.25,I would hope Bruce would come back and finish on his own
480,00:29:48.29,00:29:48.29,"terms, absolutely. I don't want to have anybody,"
481,00:29:51.04,00:29:51.04,"just-- you know what I mean, be pulled from the game because of"
482,00:29:53.25,00:29:53.25,medical reasons. I wouldn't feel right about it
483,00:29:55.21,00:29:55.21,at all. But I think that he definitely
484,00:29:57.04,00:29:57.04,"would feel like, um, he didn't get to finish under his terms,"
485,00:29:59.29,00:29:59.29,"and I know that would be a hard thing for Bruce, because Bruce"
486,00:30:01.96,00:30:01.96,"has lived a really beautiful, whole, big, gi-normous life,"
487,00:30:05.83,00:30:05.83,"so... No, I wish... I really hope"
488,00:30:09.79,00:30:09.79,Bruce gets to come back. >> Casaya totally has it out for
489,00:30:26.92,00:30:26.92,me. There's been a target on my back
490,00:30:28.96,00:30:28.96,"since the merge, so the participation part of the reward"
491,00:30:32.58,00:30:32.58,"challenge was a joke, a waste of time for me, but the good part"
492,00:30:37.04,00:30:37.04,about it was the observation time where I got to watch the
493,00:30:39.96,00:30:39.96,Casaya members go at it against one another.
494,00:30:42.25,00:30:42.25,"You know, yesterday wasn't a total loss, and being sent here"
495,00:30:45.04,00:30:45.04,to Exile Island gives me a little bit more time to think
496,00:30:47.58,00:30:47.58,about strategy for the upcoming two weeks.
497,00:30:56.17,00:30:56.17,>> Poor Brucey. I wonder how he is today.
498,00:30:59.42,00:30:59.42,"Yesterday was an extremely emotional, draining day for me."
499,00:31:03.79,00:31:03.79,Ending the day with Bruce being taken away was like the icing
500,00:31:08.79,00:31:08.79,"and the cherry and the hot fudge on top of my, uh, pretty"
501,00:31:11.75,00:31:11.75,poo-poo day. >> Let me ask you a question.
502,00:31:14.92,00:31:14.92,"If I need your vote in order to get us one person further, would"
503,00:31:18.88,00:31:18.88,you trust me and not break my back?
504,00:31:21.62,00:31:21.62,"I can't have the obsessive-compulsive, like, you"
505,00:31:25.21,00:31:25.21,"overthinking part. >> It's-It's hard for me to say,"
506,00:31:28.25,00:31:28.25,"yes, I'll just agree with everything that you think."
507,00:31:30.12,00:31:30.12,"You know, obviously, it's hard to say."
508,00:31:32.21,00:31:32.21,"But, you know, I want to be on your backside, and I would like"
509,00:31:34.21,00:31:34.21,you to be on mine. >> Okay.
510,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,">> So, we're on the same page of what we want."
511,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,">> All right, grab that little log right there, that skinny"
512,00:31:41.08,00:31:41.08,one. >> We just keep everything
513,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,between us. >> If we don't...
514,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,>> Don't. >> ...I'll kill you when I get
515,00:31:46.92,00:31:46.92,back to Hollywood. >> (laughs): No. Great.
516,00:31:48.71,00:31:48.71,">> I will. I'll drive up, and I'll kill you"
517,00:31:50.58,00:31:50.58,"in your ... little apartment. Then I'll drive over to my club,"
518,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,and that'll be it. >> That was really nice.
519,00:31:57.12,00:31:57.12,"I don't have a ... apartment. >> (shouting): Well, obviously,"
520,00:31:59.54,00:31:59.54,"dude, I don't... I've never been in your"
521,00:32:01.54,00:32:01.54,apartment! I don't know if it's ... or not!
522,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,It was an adjective! >> I know.
523,00:32:06.08,00:32:06.08,>> Don't take everything so personal!
524,00:32:09.08,00:32:09.08,>> You're just so obnoxious. You're not funny.
525,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,">> No, I'm not obnoxious, man. Think about it."
526,00:32:13.38,00:32:13.38,">> Wait, you're not... >> Why are you so..."
527,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,>> You're not... >> ...sensitive?
528,00:32:17.17,00:32:17.17,"Glenn Close, Sybil, bunny boiler, Fatal Attraction--"
529,00:32:21.71,00:32:21.71,"she's so scary, man. She's a lunatic, man, and"
530,00:32:26.46,00:32:26.46,"especially after yesterday, and finding out that the entire"
531,00:32:29.04,00:32:29.04,"tribe thinks she's an idiot. I mean, she is a dream to take"
532,00:32:32.79,00:32:32.79,to the final two. Anyone could win against her.
533,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,Anyone. It's crazy.
534,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,"She's a dream. >> Danielle, Aras, and I-- we"
535,00:33:02.50,00:33:02.50,"get home from the reward, and, uh, no one's there to greet us."
536,00:33:08.42,00:33:08.42,"Oh, my God. The tension at the camp when we"
537,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,"got back was so thick, I was afraid to-to come past the palm"
538,00:33:14.88,00:33:14.88,"frond trees, because I didn't know if, you know..."
539,00:33:17.92,00:33:17.92,Was it safe? >> Is that Court?
540,00:33:20.54,00:33:20.54,>> Welcome home. We lost a member.
541,00:33:22.38,00:33:22.38,>> Shut up! >> Bruce.
542,00:33:24.25,00:33:24.25,">> Oh, my God! >> Bruce went home?"
543,00:33:26.12,00:33:26.12,>> Yeah. He was med-evac'd out of here.
544,00:33:28.42,00:33:28.42,>> So he's done? >> Shut up.
545,00:33:30.42,00:33:30.42,">> I don't know. Well, last night was just,"
546,00:33:32.83,00:33:32.83,"like... He was super sick, then we"
547,00:33:35.12,00:33:35.12,"called medical, and then the boat came and took him up, and I"
548,00:33:39.46,00:33:39.46,"have no idea if he's in the game, if he's okay."
549,00:33:42.12,00:33:42.12,I don't know anything. >> Wow!
550,00:33:44.08,00:33:44.08,">> But you guys had a great time, I'm sure."
551,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,">> We get back to the beach, and Bruce Factor has been"
552,00:33:49.92,00:33:49.92,"med-evac'd out of here. Courtney, who was really"
553,00:33:53.88,00:33:53.88,"affected by the last challenge. And finally I see Shane, and"
554,00:33:57.62,00:33:57.62,"Shane, honestly, was an animal. >> I caught a boa constrictor."
555,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,">> He just looked like he hadn't eaten food, had water, or seen"
556,00:34:05.96,00:34:05.96,"people in days. >> You all right, man?"
557,00:34:08.96,00:34:08.96,">> Yeah, no, I'm good. >> What's going on?"
558,00:34:10.96,00:34:10.96,>> Nothing. >> Damn!
559,00:34:35.21,00:34:35.21,>> We're not good. I don't trust her.
560,00:34:36.88,00:34:36.88,">> Shane, Shane... >> She's got to come to me."
561,00:34:38.46,00:34:38.46,>> She will. She'll talk to you about it.
562,00:34:40.21,00:34:40.21,">> I am disappointed in her in a big way, and I am not going"
563,00:34:42.42,00:34:42.42,"out before Danielle, dude. That bitch did nothing for 30"
564,00:34:45.29,00:34:45.29,days. Gets to go up yesterday.
565,00:34:47.88,00:34:47.88,"She's done nothing but be lazy and wait to get fed, and Cirie"
566,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,takes her? That is not right.
567,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,"I have put Cirie on my back, all 300 pounds of her."
568,00:34:56.04,00:34:56.04,Have put her on my back. You and I both have.
569,00:35:00.12,00:35:00.12,It was wrong yesterday. It was wrong.
570,00:35:04.92,00:35:04.92,>> Didn't you play sports? Didn't you have teams?
571,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,"Like, you lose some, you win some."
572,00:35:08.88,00:35:08.88,"Get over it. >> Listen, I'm not worried about"
573,00:35:15.88,00:35:15.88,anybody but me now. >> I know you're not.
574,00:35:17.96,00:35:17.96,>> And guess what? Everyone is in big trouble
575,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,'cause I'm going to do whatever it takes.
576,00:35:21.58,00:35:21.58,If you and Cirie don't make me absolutely believe that it's
577,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,still the three of us... >> Mm.
578,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,>> ...I'm turning the whole game.
579,00:35:27.21,00:35:27.21,"I mean, look at me, look at me. I'm in the game now."
580,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"I'm in the game. >> I know, and..."
581,00:35:31.21,00:35:31.21,">> And everyone's in a big, big problem."
582,00:35:33.67,00:35:33.67,>> I tried not to get into it with Shane.
583,00:35:36.88,00:35:36.88,All of it was basically his insecurity about where he
584,00:35:39.83,00:35:39.83,"stands. In my thinking, the last thing I"
585,00:35:41.96,00:35:41.96,"need is Shane on the loose really changing this game up,"
586,00:35:45.12,00:35:45.12,so just let him say his piece. We'll get him down.
587,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"We'll calm him down. We'll gain back his trust, and"
588,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,"hopefully, Cirie will peace it with him, and we'll be all good."
589,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,">> First, as far as the game part is concerned, I've never,"
590,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,"ever wavered about me, you and Aras."
591,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,Did you see me there? Did you see me?
592,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,"""Oh, okay, it's just you and you."""
593,00:36:04.96,00:36:04.96,It was so hard because I know how you felt.
594,00:36:07.62,00:36:07.62,Did you not think it was hard for me to not take you after
595,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,"everything? >> Yeah, but, I... yeah."
596,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,I didn't... I didn't know that it was...
597,00:36:15.04,00:36:15.04,I had no idea that you and Danielle had the type of...
598,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,"Like, I watched it, but I was just, like..."
599,00:36:19.12,00:36:19.12,>> That's what I'm saying. It's not like a type of thing
600,00:36:21.38,00:36:21.38,like we have. Nothing like that at all.
601,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,Shane is so hurt because he feels like he deserved the
602,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,reward way more than Danielle. He just thought it would be a
603,00:36:30.67,00:36:30.67,"no-brainer. If I won, me, him and Aras would"
604,00:36:33.29,00:36:33.29,go. >> Uh-uh.
605,00:36:43.54,00:36:43.54,>> All right. >> Yes?
606,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,">> Mm-hmm. >> Me, Cirie and Aras are in an"
607,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,"alliance, officially, and will be until we get to the four."
608,00:37:02.08,00:37:02.08,The whole discussion was a big rant and was absolutely
609,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,calculated by me in order to get ahead of Cirie and Aras
610,00:37:12.12,00:37:12.12,"mentally, and it played exactly the way I wanted it to."
611,00:37:16.25,00:37:16.25,"I think, subconsciously, I control that-that threesome for"
612,00:37:19.62,00:37:19.62,"sure. >> I'm just cleaning, um,"
613,00:37:39.00,00:37:39.00,"Bruce's Zen garden, and I wanted to write the words, like, ""Love,"
614,00:37:43.50,00:37:43.50,"Bruce,"" just to send him love right now, 'cause no matter"
615,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,"where he is right now, he's-he's having a hard time."
616,00:37:50.08,00:37:50.08,"I was going to put l-u-v, ""luv you,"" on this side."
617,00:37:53.00,00:37:53.00,">> That would be great. >> Bruce was just go, go, go,"
618,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"go, go. That was his mentality, and I"
619,00:38:00.75,00:38:00.75,"gave him a lot of credit. I mean, I looked at him as like"
620,00:38:04.21,00:38:04.21,"a father figure. I mean, I really connected with"
621,00:38:06.21,00:38:06.21,"him. You know, I said my prayers for"
622,00:38:08.17,00:38:08.17,him last night. I just really hope that Bruce is
623,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"okay. Um, you know, it was..."
624,00:38:13.42,00:38:13.42,"I had, like, an eerie feeling last night that he wasn't even"
625,00:38:15.75,00:38:15.75,"in the shelter, and I just pray to God that everything's fine"
626,00:38:17.75,00:38:17.75,and he's healthy. >> He would love it.
627,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,He would love it. >> I don't even care about the
628,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,game aspect of it. I just want to make sure he's
629,00:38:28.17,00:38:28.17,okay. So I hope we find out soon!
630,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,>> Here comes a boat. >> Terry has a red shirt with
631,00:38:43.12,00:38:43.12,"blue sleeves, right? >> Yeah."
632,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,">> It's still three, whoever it is, man."
633,00:38:50.71,00:38:50.71,">> Is that Terry? >> Yeah, that's Terry."
634,00:38:52.46,00:38:52.46,>> It's Jeff. >> Isn't that Probst?
635,00:38:54.21,00:38:54.21,>> Shut up! >> And Probst?
636,00:38:56.25,00:38:56.25,">> Yeah, and Probst is with him. >> Jeff and Terry."
637,00:38:58.67,00:38:58.67,Wow. I need to go find out what this
638,00:39:00.67,00:39:00.67,"is about. >> PROBST: What's going on,"
639,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,"Aras? >> A lot, apparently."
640,00:39:07.00,00:39:07.00,>> It is Terry. Damn.
641,00:39:09.75,00:39:09.75,>> Well... >> Yeah.
642,00:39:11.75,00:39:11.75,">> PROBST: How you doing? >> Good to see you, sir."
643,00:39:13.75,00:39:13.75,>> PROBST: Nice to see you. (indistinct chatter)
644,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,Hello. >> Hello.
645,00:39:17.71,00:39:17.71,>> Hi. >> PROBST: Where's Courtney?
646,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,You heard about Bruce? >> I haven't heard anything.
647,00:39:24.71,00:39:24.71,>> PROBST: I'll give you the whole low-down.
648,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,>> I haven't heard anything. >> PROBST: Let's do it up at
649,00:39:28.25,00:39:28.25,camp. >> PROBST: Wouldn't have a...
650,00:39:34.38,00:39:34.38,I don't know if you guys got seats or anywhere you can plop
651,00:39:36.12,00:39:36.12,"it. Okay, I know everybody wants an"
652,00:39:42.21,00:39:42.21,update. I have an update.
653,00:39:44.92,00:39:44.92,"First, we got to catch Terry up. I think everybody was pretty"
654,00:39:47.25,00:39:47.25,"clear that when we went to the last reward challenge, Bruce"
655,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,"wasn't feeling very well. Had a lot of stomach pain, was"
656,00:39:52.12,00:39:52.12,"having trouble walking. Reward challenge ends, pain"
657,00:39:55.54,00:39:55.54,continues. Bruce asks for medical to come
658,00:39:59.00,00:39:59.00,"in and check him. Medical checks him out, runs"
659,00:40:01.12,00:40:01.12,"some tests, says you need to go to a hospital."
660,00:40:03.33,00:40:03.33,And it is a good thing that he got there when he did.
661,00:40:05.29,00:40:05.29,They ran some tests and found out that his entire digestive
662,00:40:08.17,00:40:08.17,system-- his colon and his bladder-- were blocked.
663,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,Nothing was coming out. And I know everybody's concerned
664,00:40:15.12,00:40:15.12,"about Bruce's well-being. He's going to be okay, but he"
665,00:40:18.04,00:40:18.04,will not return to the game as a player.
666,00:40:23.21,00:40:23.21,Bruce is no longer in the running for a million dollars.
667,00:40:31.12,00:40:31.12,It is now down to you six. There will be no immunity
668,00:40:36.88,00:40:36.88,challenge today. Nobody will be voted out tonight
669,00:40:40.21,00:40:40.21,at Tribal Council. We're hoping that Bruce will be
670,00:40:43.25,00:40:43.25,back for the next Tribal Council and continue on as a member of
671,00:40:46.46,00:40:46.46,"the jury, but we're waiting for approval from the doctors."
672,00:40:50.25,00:40:50.25,"So, that's the update. You have the afternoon off, and"
673,00:40:54.54,00:40:54.54,the game continues on. Make sense?
674,00:40:56.25,00:40:56.25,>> Sure. Thanks for coming. >> PROBST: Sorry it was bad
675,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,"news. >> Thanks, Jeff."
676,00:41:00.21,00:41:00.21,">> PROBST: Later, guys. >> Bruce is the master sensei."
677,00:41:17.54,00:41:17.54,"You know, he'll be back. He's a fighter."
678,00:41:20.04,00:41:20.04,I-I don't think any one of us could have put up with the pain
679,00:41:22.71,00:41:22.71,"that he put up with in the hopes of, uh, staying in the game, and"
680,00:41:27.75,00:41:27.75,"to see him go this way is a shame, 'cause he's a warrior, a"
681,00:41:29.79,00:41:29.79,total warrior. 57-year-old master sensei in the
