581,00:35:33.67,00:35:33.67,>> I tried not to get into itwith Shane.
582,00:35:36.88,00:35:36.88,All of it was basically hisinsecurity about where he
583,00:35:39.83,00:35:39.83,"stands.In my thinking, the last thing I"
584,00:35:41.96,00:35:41.96,"need is Shane on the loosereally changing this game up,"
585,00:35:45.12,00:35:45.12,so just let him say his piece.We'll get him down.
586,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"We'll calm him down.We'll gain back his trust, and"
587,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,"hopefully, Cirie will peace itwith him, and we'll be all good."
588,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,">> First, as far as the gamepart is concerned, I've never,"
589,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,"ever wavered about me, you andAras."
590,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,Did you see me there?Did you see me?
591,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,"""Oh, okay, it's just you andyou."""
592,00:36:04.96,00:36:04.96,It was so hard because I knowhow you felt.
593,00:36:07.62,00:36:07.62,Did you not think it was hardfor me to not take you after
594,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,"everything?>> Yeah, but, I... yeah."
595,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,I didn't...I didn't know that it was...
596,00:36:15.04,00:36:15.04,I had no idea that you andDanielle had the type of...
597,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,"Like, I watched it, but I wasjust, like..."
598,00:36:19.12,00:36:19.12,>> That's what I'm saying.It's not like a type of thing
599,00:36:21.38,00:36:21.38,like we have.Nothing like that at all.
600,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,Shane is so hurt because hefeels like he deserved the
601,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,reward way more than Danielle.He just thought it would be a
602,00:36:30.67,00:36:30.67,"no-brainer.If I won, me, him and Aras would"
603,00:36:33.29,00:36:33.29,go.>> Uh-uh.
604,00:36:43.54,00:36:43.54,>> All right.>> Yes?
605,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,">> Mm-hmm.>> Me, Cirie and Aras are in an"
606,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,"alliance, officially, and willbe until we get to the four."
607,00:37:02.08,00:37:02.08,The whole discussion was a bigrant and was absolutely
608,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,calculated by me in order to getahead of Cirie and Aras
609,00:37:12.12,00:37:12.12,"mentally, and it played exactlythe way I wanted it to."
610,00:37:16.25,00:37:16.25,"I think, subconsciously, Icontrol that-that threesome for"
611,00:37:19.62,00:37:19.62,"sure.>> I'm just cleaning, um,"
612,00:37:39.00,00:37:39.00,"Bruce's Zen garden, and I wantedto write the words, like, ""Love,"
613,00:37:43.50,00:37:43.50,"Bruce,"" just to send him loveright now, 'cause no matter"
614,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,"where he is right now, he's-he'shaving a hard time."
615,00:37:50.08,00:37:50.08,"I was going to put l-u-v, ""luvyou,"" on this side."
616,00:37:53.00,00:37:53.00,">> That would be great.>> Bruce was just go, go, go,"
617,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"go, go.That was his mentality, and I"
618,00:38:00.75,00:38:00.75,"gave him a lot of credit.I mean, I looked at him as like"
619,00:38:04.21,00:38:04.21,"a father figure.I mean, I really connected with"
620,00:38:06.21,00:38:06.21,"him.You know, I said my prayers for"
621,00:38:08.17,00:38:08.17,him last night.I just really hope that Bruce is
622,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"okay.Um, you know, it was..."
623,00:38:13.42,00:38:13.42,"I had, like, an eerie feelinglast night that he wasn't even"
624,00:38:15.75,00:38:15.75,"in the shelter, and I just prayto God that everything's fine"
625,00:38:17.75,00:38:17.75,and he's healthy.>> He would love it.
626,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,He would love it.>> I don't even care about the
627,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,game aspect of it.I just want to make sure he's
628,00:38:28.17,00:38:28.17,okay.So I hope we find out soon!
629,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,>> Here comes a boat.>> Terry has a red shirt with
630,00:38:43.12,00:38:43.12,"blue sleeves, right?>> Yeah."
631,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,">> It's still three, whoever itis, man."
632,00:38:50.71,00:38:50.71,">> Is that Terry?>> Yeah, that's Terry."
633,00:38:52.46,00:38:52.46,>> It's Jeff.>> Isn't that Probst?

649,00:39:34.38,00:39:34.38,I don't know if you guys gotseats or anywhere you can plop
650,00:39:36.12,00:39:36.12,"it.Okay, I know everybody wants an"
651,00:39:42.21,00:39:42.21,update.I have an update.
652,00:39:44.92,00:39:44.92,"First, we got to catch Terry up.I think everybody was pretty"
653,00:39:47.25,00:39:47.25,"clear that when we went to thelast reward challenge, Bruce"
654,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,"wasn't feeling very well.Had a lot of stomach pain, was"
655,00:39:52.12,00:39:52.12,"having trouble walking.Reward challenge ends, pain"
656,00:39:55.54,00:39:55.54,continues.Bruce asks for medical to come
657,00:39:59.00,00:39:59.00,"in and check him.Medical checks him out, runs"
658,00:40:01.12,00:40:01.12,"some tests, says you need to goto a hospital."
659,00:40:03.33,00:40:03.33,And it is a good thing that hegot there when he did.
660,00:40:05.29,00:40:05.29,They ran some tests and foundout that his entire digestive
661,00:40:08.17,00:40:08.17,system-- his colon and hisbladder-- were blocked.
662,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,Nothing was coming out.And I know everybody's concerned
663,00:40:15.12,00:40:15.12,"about Bruce's well-being.He's going to be okay, but he"
664,00:40:18.04,00:40:18.04,will not return to the game asa player.
665,00:40:23.21,00:40:23.21,Bruce is no longer in therunning for a million dollars.
666,00:40:31.12,00:40:31.12,It is now down to you six.There will be no immunity
667,00:40:36.88,00:40:36.88,challenge today.Nobody will be voted out tonight
668,00:40:40.21,00:40:40.21,at Tribal Council.We're hoping that Bruce will be

670,00:40:46.46,00:40:46.46,"the jury, but we're waiting forapproval from the doctors."
671,00:40:50.25,00:40:50.25,"So, that's the update.You have the afternoon off, and"
672,00:40:54.54,00:40:54.54,the game continues on.Make sense?

678,00:41:22.71,00:41:22.71,"that he put up with in the hopesof, uh, staying in the game, and"
