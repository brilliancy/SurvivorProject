9,00:00:31.25,00:00:31.25,>> I never experienced dehydration like this.
10,00:00:33.25,00:00:33.25,Half of us can't even stand up. It's crazy!
11,00:00:35.42,00:00:35.42,"We're starving here, bro! >> PROBST: Moto..."

17,00:00:56.96,00:00:56.96,the first to be voted out. >> I can't function like this.
18,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,">> All right, Gary, I'm going to call in the medical boat and get"
19,00:01:02.83,00:01:02.83,you out of here. >> PROBST: Gary was the first
20,00:01:04.38,00:01:04.38,"man to leave when he fell ill... >> One, two, three, lift."
21,00:01:07.08,00:01:07.08,>> PROBST: ...and was evacuated for medical attention.
22,00:01:09.46,00:01:09.46,Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji...
23,00:01:11.62,00:01:11.62,At tribal council... >> Wow.

26,00:01:17.58,00:01:17.58,Drop your buffs. >> What?
27,00:01:19.46,00:01:19.46,>> Mookie. >> PROBST: When the tribes were
28,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,"mixed, the new Ravu Tribe found itself with six strong men and"
29,00:01:24.17,00:01:24.17,"Lisi. Ravu was physically strong, but"
30,00:01:26.79,00:01:26.79,the luck of the draw sent them to live on the beach with
31,00:01:29.08,00:01:29.08,nothing. >> What do you guys think about
32,00:01:33.12,00:01:33.12,"me, you, Ed, Dreamz? >> PROBST: Alex, Edgardo,"
33,00:01:36.29,00:01:36.29,"Mookie, and Dreamz bonded together to form a formidable"
34,00:01:39.17,00:01:39.17,alliance. >> All right.
35,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,>> PROBST: They called themselves the four horsemen.
36,00:01:43.08,00:01:43.08,">> Right now we have to get nasty, and we have to use"
37,00:01:44.96,00:01:44.96,everything that we have. >> PROBST: At the luxurious new
38,00:01:47.29,00:01:47.29,Moto camp... >> So we'll use that line.
39,00:01:49.96,00:01:49.96,>> PROBST: ...another alliance of four revolved around Earl and
40,00:01:52.67,00:01:52.67,"Yau-Man, and included Cassandra and Michelle."
41,00:01:55.54,00:01:55.54,>> It's all about the team. Who has all the power?
42,00:01:58.08,00:01:58.08,That would be me. >> PROBST: There were two hidden
43,00:02:00.96,00:02:00.96,"immunity idols, one at each camp."
44,00:02:03.71,00:02:03.71,"Mookie, Alex, and Edgardo found the hidden idol on Ravu."
45,00:02:07.04,00:02:07.04,>> There's no words to describe how much this means to me in
46,00:02:09.33,00:02:09.33,this game. >> PROBST: They kept it secret
47,00:02:11.67,00:02:11.67,from their tribe mates Lisi and Dreamz.
48,00:02:14.00,00:02:14.00,"And with Earl's help, Yau-Man found the one on Moto."
49,00:02:18.21,00:02:18.21,>> This is my million dollars. >> PROBST: Excluded from the
50,00:02:21.79,00:02:21.79,"core alliances, Anthony, Rocky, and Lisi..."
51,00:02:25.71,00:02:25.71,The tribe has spoken. ...were quickly picked off.
52,00:02:29.17,00:02:29.17,On day 22... >> Look at that.
53,00:02:31.42,00:02:31.42,>> PROBST: ...the two tribes merged into one.
54,00:02:34.62,00:02:34.62,"Excited that they were moving to the Moto camp of luxury, they"
55,00:02:37.58,00:02:37.58,were shocked to find everything gone.
56,00:02:40.08,00:02:40.08,">> Oh, my God. >> Oh, no!"
57,00:02:42.29,00:02:42.29,>> PROBST: The stage was set for a battle between the two
58,00:02:44.50,00:02:44.50,competing alliances. >> So the moment has finally
59,00:02:47.38,00:02:47.38,arrived. I'm ready to fight.
60,00:02:49.83,00:02:49.83,>> PROBST: You will not be going back to camp.
61,00:02:51.71,00:02:51.71,We're heading to tribal council right now.
62,00:02:54.42,00:02:54.42,In a twist that sent Michelle to tribal council without her
63,00:02:57.17,00:02:57.17,"allies Earl, Yau-Man, and Cassandra, she was voted off."
64,00:03:01.62,00:03:01.62,The tribe has spoken. >> That just flipped the whole
65,00:03:05.04,00:03:05.04,script around. >> PROBST: The four horsemen had
66,00:03:07.88,00:03:07.88,"the upper hand. >> Unless I'm mistaken, the four"
67,00:03:10.71,00:03:10.71,of us are controlling this game right now.
68,00:03:14.29,00:03:14.29,">> I didn't tell you, but we found the immunity idol on Ravu."
69,00:03:17.04,00:03:17.04,>> PROBST: But a revealing secret caused Dreamz to waver.
70,00:03:19.79,00:03:19.79,">> We had a pact, and it kind of made me not trust them a little"
71,00:03:22.25,00:03:22.25,bit. So I'm going to trust them until
72,00:03:23.83,00:03:23.83,I can't trust them no more. I'm not going to deceive y'all.
73,00:03:27.08,00:03:27.08,">> PROBST: In a bold move, Dreamz betrayed the four"
74,00:03:29.17,00:03:29.17,horsemen. >> Mookie's got an immunity
75,00:03:30.88,00:03:30.88,idol. >> Cassandra wants me gone.
76,00:03:33.12,00:03:33.12,">> PROBST: Alex, sensing that he was in danger, asked Mookie for"
77,00:03:36.25,00:03:36.25,the protection of the hidden idol.
78,00:03:37.96,00:03:37.96,">> It's going to work, Mook. It's going to work."
79,00:03:40.08,00:03:40.08,>> Mookie gave Alex the idol. >> PROBST: But Dreamz informed
80,00:03:42.29,00:03:42.29,Earl's alliance that now Alex had the idol.
81,00:03:45.08,00:03:45.08,">> He gave it to him? >> I promise, I promise."
82,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,>> PROBST: So they switched their vote to Edgardo.
83,00:03:49.79,00:03:49.79,">> If we hit them with Edgardo, that hits them from the left"
84,00:03:51.92,00:03:51.92,"side. >> PROBST: At tribal council,"
85,00:03:54.21,00:03:54.21,Alex confidently played the idol.
86,00:03:56.42,00:03:56.42,Alex is immune from tonight's vote.
87,00:03:59.25,00:03:59.25,But the votes for Edgardo spelled the end of the four
88,00:04:01.42,00:04:01.42,"horsemen. Edgardo, the tribe has spoken."
89,00:04:06.17,00:04:06.17,"The writing was on the wall, and Mookie and Alex were the next to"
90,00:04:08.29,00:04:08.29,"go. On day 34, Yau-Man played hard"
91,00:04:14.17,00:04:14.17,and won a 2008 Ford Super Duty truck.
92,00:04:18.08,00:04:18.08,And he continued to play hard when he immediately turned it
93,00:04:20.75,00:04:20.75,"into a bargaining chip. >> Dreamz, how badly do you need"
94,00:04:23.17,00:04:23.17,that car? >> You know how bad I need a
95,00:04:25.08,00:04:25.08,"car, Yau-Man. >> I want to see if I can make a"
96,00:04:27.12,00:04:27.12,"deal. There are six of us left now,"
97,00:04:29.12,00:04:29.12,right? >> Yes.
98,00:04:30.75,00:04:30.75,">> When there are four of us left, if you and I happen to be"
99,00:04:33.88,00:04:33.88,"one of the four, if you win the immunity for that round, you"
100,00:04:37.04,00:04:37.04,will give it to me. >> I promise to God.
101,00:04:40.67,00:04:40.67,>> PROBST: So I want to be clear.
102,00:04:42.12,00:04:42.12,"You're saying, ""I'll give you the truck."""
103,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,>> Right. >> PROBST: You can't enforce it.
104,00:04:45.92,00:04:45.92,It's his word. >> It's his word.
105,00:04:47.17,00:04:47.17,It's his word. His word is good.
106,00:04:48.50,00:04:48.50,">> I give you my word, Yau. >> PROBST: Yau-Man then"
107,00:04:50.08,00:04:50.08,"strategically sent himself to Exile Island, where he could"
108,00:04:52.83,00:04:52.83,read the clue for the rehidden idol.
109,00:04:56.54,00:04:56.54,">> ""If you're pining for treasure, it's within your"
110,00:04:59.46,00:04:59.46,"reach."" >> PROBST: Yau-Man, already in"
111,00:05:03.21,00:05:03.21,"possession of one hidden immunity idol, gave Earl the"
112,00:05:06.04,00:05:06.04,"clue to the new rehidden idol, and Earl quickly found it."
113,00:05:11.12,00:05:11.12,>> There you go. And we are in business.
114,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,>> PROBST: Boo saved himself when he won the next immunity
115,00:05:18.25,00:05:18.25,challenge. Boo wins immunity!
116,00:05:21.62,00:05:21.62,"Finding a loophole in the truck- for-immunity deal, Dreamz"
117,00:05:24.71,00:05:24.71,plotted to oust Yau-Man before the final four to avoid the
118,00:05:28.08,00:05:28.08,dilemma he might face later. >> I want to get rid of Yau
119,00:05:31.04,00:05:31.04,today. Yau has an immunity idol.
120,00:05:33.92,00:05:33.92,"I give him mine idol at top four, so that puts him two spots"
121,00:05:36.42,00:05:36.42,up. >> PROBST: But Yau-Man sensed
122,00:05:38.75,00:05:38.75,danger. >> I have bad vibes.
123,00:05:40.83,00:05:40.83,>> PROBST: So at tribal council...
124,00:05:43.21,00:05:43.21,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and feels they
125,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,"need to play it, now is the time to do so."
126,00:05:47.62,00:05:47.62,"...in another strategic move, Yau-Man played the idol and"
127,00:05:50.04,00:05:50.04,"saved himself. With just two votes against her,"
128,00:05:53.62,00:05:53.62,"Stacy joined the jury. Now only five remain: Earl, Yau-"
129,00:05:58.21,00:05:58.21,"Man, Dreamz, Cassandra, and Boo. Will Dreamz win immunity and"
130,00:06:03.88,00:06:03.88,keep his word with Yau-Man? Find out tonight as they compete
131,00:06:07.42,00:06:07.42,"in their final immunity challenges, and one outlasts all"
132,00:06:11.67,00:06:11.67,the rest to become the sole survivor.
133,00:06:23.58,00:06:23.58,( theme song playing ) >> Yeah.
134,00:07:41.62,00:07:41.62,"Tribal council was brutal tonight, lots of talk concerning"
135,00:07:45.46,00:07:45.46,my truck giveaway and how that put a big target on my back.
136,00:07:50.75,00:07:50.75,"So I ended up using my hidden immunity idol, which was a good"
137,00:07:54.96,00:07:54.96,"thing, because otherwise I wouldn't have been here."
138,00:07:59.08,00:07:59.08,">> You did what you were supposed to do, and you played"
139,00:08:01.25,00:08:01.25,"the idol. I mean, it could have been just"
140,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,to flush the idol out. >> Yeah.
141,00:08:04.42,00:08:04.42,>> Because they know that you have it.
142,00:08:05.83,00:08:05.83,They're still not certain whether I have it or not.
143,00:08:08.08,00:08:08.08,>> Right. Keep it that way.
144,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,>> I always get suspicious when people don't tell me what
145,00:08:12.04,00:08:12.04,they're doing. >> Right.
146,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,>> That's the dead giveaway. When you don't tell me
147,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,"anything.... >> They might try to target me,"
148,00:08:25.92,00:08:25.92,because now they know that I don't trust them.
149,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,"Obviously, it's time for me to protect myself."
150,00:08:30.38,00:08:30.38,"It's all about cannibalism now, trying to eat each other up."
151,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,>> Two more days to go. Here's one for you.
152,00:09:03.04,00:09:03.04,">> Day 37 and five of us left, and because of my deal with"
153,00:09:08.08,00:09:08.08,"Dreamz, I am probably the biggest target."
154,00:09:11.46,00:09:11.46,"Because if they vote me out before final four, then Dreamz"
155,00:09:15.25,00:09:15.25,will not have to renege on his public agreement with me.
156,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,So what I need to do at this immunity challenge is to win.
157,00:09:40.67,00:09:40.67,">> We're thinking that you're standing with Yau, and now"
158,00:09:42.58,00:09:42.58,"you're telling us that, you know, you would have been down"
159,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,with whatever. >> That's where everybody's
160,00:09:47.08,00:09:47.08,messing up. I've always said certain people
161,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,in the top five. I never changed that.
162,00:09:52.25,00:09:52.25,And we weren't at the top five. So I wasn't going to write down
163,00:09:55.21,00:09:55.21,"Yau's name, because that's going against my word on what I gave"
164,00:09:59.08,00:09:59.08,Yau. And totally expected it.
165,00:10:01.92,00:10:01.92,That's why I said I wouldn't have told him.
166,00:10:03.33,00:10:03.33,I said it would have been to Yau to defend himself.
167,00:10:07.17,00:10:07.17,">> Unfortunately, it does become a time in the game where you do"
168,00:10:09.67,00:10:09.67,have to look at your own personal interests and cut your
169,00:10:12.12,00:10:12.12,friends out. And I don't see any way that
170,00:10:14.46,00:10:14.46,Earl is going to vote Yau or Yau's going to vote Earl.
171,00:10:17.08,00:10:17.08,"So Dreamz, Boo, and myself, we're going to have to bond"
172,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17,together while we have the numbers to level the playing
173,00:10:23.21,00:10:23.21,field. >> So whenever people try to be
174,00:10:26.08,00:10:26.08,slick... >> But does he have it?
175,00:10:28.25,00:10:28.25,You said you'd be real with us. >> All right.
176,00:10:38.12,00:10:38.12,">> He has three clues. I mean, you know, he could have"
177,00:10:39.92,00:10:39.92,found it pretty quickly. >> If Earl has the hidden
178,00:10:54.17,00:10:54.17,"immunity idol and Yau-Man wins the immunity today, we're in"
179,00:10:57.12,00:10:57.12,"trouble. Definitely Dreamz, myself, or"
180,00:11:01.79,00:11:01.79,"Boo will be going home. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
181,00:11:20.21,00:11:20.21,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
182,00:11:22.00,00:11:22.00,>> Sure. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
183,00:11:23.29,00:11:23.29,"Boo, take back the immunity necklace."
184,00:11:25.04,00:11:25.04,">> Always my favorite part. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
185,00:11:34.83,00:11:34.83,"is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
186,00:11:38.58,00:11:38.58,"make your way through a massive, five-section maze, and you will"
187,00:11:42.17,00:11:42.17,be doing so blindfolded. Here's how it works.
188,00:11:46.54,00:11:46.54,Each of you will be wearing a uniquely shaped medallion.

250,00:16:32.75,00:16:32.75,Orient yourself. Yau-Man hits a dead end.
251,00:16:37.75,00:16:37.75,Dreamz is at his fourth drawbridge.
252,00:16:40.21,00:16:40.21,"He has it lowered. Dreamz now heading across,"

264,00:17:36.04,00:17:36.04,and crossing it. Yau-Man wins immunity!

266,00:17:52.38,00:17:52.38,over. Yau-Man is safe at tonight's

268,00:18:04.25,00:18:04.25,"after 37 long days, somebody going home tonight."
269,00:18:06.88,00:18:06.88,Should be a crazy afternoon. See you at tribal.
270,00:18:09.33,00:18:09.33,"Head on back to camp. >> Well, I just won immunity."
271,00:18:41.08,00:18:41.08,That guarantees my place in the final four.
272,00:18:44.25,00:18:44.25,I cannot be voted out tonight. Earl has the other rehidden
273,00:18:48.29,00:18:48.29,"immunity idol, so he cannot be voted out."
274,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,This was a very important win for me.
275,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,">> Okay. >> And we're at the final four,"
276,00:18:59.04,00:18:59.04,"then we'll decided what to do. >> Oh, okay, all right, all"
277,00:19:01.62,00:19:01.62,"right, we're good. >> We're good."
278,00:19:03.42,00:19:03.42,">> All right, proud of you. >> Thank you."
279,00:19:07.04,00:19:07.04,"If everybody plays it straight, it will be Boo, unless Boo tries"
280,00:19:10.21,00:19:10.21,to make some deals with other people.
281,00:19:12.92,00:19:12.92,"Boo, I'd like to say you are one of the strongest competitors"
282,00:19:15.62,00:19:15.62,I've ever met. >> I know that's why you're
283,00:19:17.62,00:19:17.62,voting me out tonight. I understand.
284,00:19:19.04,00:19:19.04,">> No hard feelings, okay? I know you play really,"
285,00:19:21.79,00:19:21.79,"really... I mean, you don't give up, and I appreciate that."
286,00:19:24.21,00:19:24.21,">> I knew at the challenge, when I looked at it, what the writing"
287,00:19:26.83,00:19:26.83,"on the wail said. It read, ""Boo, good game; it's"
288,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"time for you to go."" >> I'm voting Boo."
289,00:19:39.67,00:19:39.67,"There's no... come on, now. >> I don't need a heads-up"
290,00:19:43.92,00:19:43.92,before I leave. I don't care.
291,00:19:44.92,00:19:44.92,You know what I mean? I'm a man.
292,00:19:46.08,00:19:46.08,I feel I'm a man. I feel you're a man.
293,00:19:48.71,00:19:48.71,"Even when I leave tonight or tomorrow, I'm going to still"
294,00:19:51.08,00:19:51.08,"say, ""Yeah, Yau-Man is the smartest man I ever knew."
295,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,"Yau-Man was one of the world's greatest fathers to me."""
296,00:19:55.92,00:19:55.92,And that's how I see things. I wouldn't be surprised if I was
297,00:19:58.62,00:19:58.62,"voted out tonight, because people have been lying and"
298,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,trying to blind-side people from the time we started playing this
299,00:20:03.29,00:20:03.29,game. So if they say they was going to
300,00:20:06.12,00:20:06.12,"vote Boo home and then vote me home, I wouldn't be... that"
301,00:20:09.50,00:20:09.50,"wouldn't surprise me at all. As a matter of fact, tonight is"
302,00:20:11.83,00:20:11.83,going to be the first night that I take all my stuff to tribal
303,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,"council. >> Earl, can I talk to you for a"
304,00:20:16.21,00:20:16.21,couple minutes? >> Uh-huh.
305,00:20:33.08,00:20:33.08,>> I can compete well against Yau.
306,00:20:34.96,00:20:34.96,I think me and you together have a much better chance than one of
307,00:20:37.54,00:20:37.54,"us against him, because he's good."
308,00:20:41.25,00:20:41.25,">> Yeah, there's a better chance when it's you and me."
309,00:20:43.50,00:20:43.50,>> That's what I'm saying. >> So my plea to Earl was to
310,00:20:46.08,00:20:46.08,vote out Dreamz. Take me to the final three with
311,00:20:50.54,00:20:50.54,"you, Yau, and myself. I said you're guaranteed second"
312,00:20:55.08,00:20:55.08,when you go with Yau. You have an option to win a
313,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17,"million if you go against me. That's a difference of $900,000."
314,00:21:03.25,00:21:03.25,"That's my plea. And either way you decide, I'll"
315,00:21:07.00,00:21:07.00,respect it. >> I'll definitely give it some
316,00:21:09.88,00:21:09.88,thought. >> It's a decent option for
317,00:21:12.29,00:21:12.29,Earl. It's a great option for me.
318,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,"If he takes it, he takes it, and I live to play another day."
319,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,>> I'm always puzzled at this point.
320,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,Boo proposed to vote out Dreamz. That would just be the smart
321,00:21:34.17,00:21:34.17,thing for me to do. Everybody would want to go
322,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,"against Boo. You know, I'd rather go against"
323,00:21:39.04,00:21:39.04,Boo or Cassandra than go against Dreamz or Yau-Man.
324,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,"Dreamz gets the sympathy vote, and Yau-Man gets the underdog"
325,00:21:45.25,00:21:45.25,vote. It's not about who I like and
326,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,who I got alliances with. It's who can I beat in the final
327,00:21:50.21,00:21:50.21,"two. >> Well, do you think there's"
328,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,going to be one more challenge tomorrow?
329,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,>> Uh-huh. >> You believe that you think
330,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,it's wise to bring Dreamz to the last challenge?
331,00:22:05.62,00:22:05.62,"Dreamz has a chance of winning a challenge, and he's definitely"
332,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17,got a chance at winning a vote. >> Sympathy vote.
333,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,>> Huh? >> Sympathy vote.
334,00:22:15.96,00:22:15.96,">> Oh, yeah. I think you'll win against"
335,00:22:18.04,00:22:18.04,everybody else but Dreamz. That's been my thought the whole
336,00:22:19.96,00:22:19.96,way. So if you wanted to make a deal
337,00:22:23.25,00:22:23.25,"with me, I would definitely take second place over fifth place."
338,00:22:28.38,00:22:28.38,You'll win a vote against me. >> Boo's plan does sound
339,00:22:32.83,00:22:32.83,enticing. I'm thinking through it.
340,00:22:35.71,00:22:35.71,"But to change from him to Dreamz, I need one more vote."
341,00:22:42.50,00:22:42.50,">> So we're good, man. Good job today, man, getting"
342,00:22:45.00,00:22:45.00,that immunity. >> Yeah.
343,00:22:46.62,00:22:46.62,">> Good job, because you know... >> Uh-huh."
344,00:23:04.46,00:23:04.46,>> Tonight is going to be pins and needles night.
345,00:23:07.08,00:23:07.08,"I think I put myself again in a decent position, but it will be"
346,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,a little nerve-racking until the votes are tallied up.
347,00:23:36.04,00:23:36.04,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of the jury: Rocky,"
348,00:23:39.21,00:23:39.21,"Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie, Alex, and Stacy, voted out at"
349,00:23:46.75,00:23:46.75,"the last tribal council. Dreamz, with only five people"
350,00:23:55.33,00:23:55.33,"left in the game, let's talk about threats."
351,00:23:59.25,00:23:59.25,Are you more concerned about somebody who is a physical
352,00:24:02.04,00:24:02.04,threat or somebody who's not trustworthy and could betray you
353,00:24:05.38,00:24:05.38,this late in the game? >> I'm more concerned about
354,00:24:08.17,00:24:08.17,"somebody who ain't keeping their word, because anybody can win a"
355,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,"challenge, you know what I mean? So I'm more concerned about"
356,00:24:14.38,00:24:14.38,somebody who don't keep their word.
357,00:24:16.50,00:24:16.50,>> PROBST: So that's got to be difficult to navigate at this
358,00:24:18.54,00:24:18.54,"point, because keeping your word has not been the thing that's"
359,00:24:20.96,00:24:20.96,going on at tribal council lately.
360,00:24:23.17,00:24:23.17,>> It's a game for a million dollars.
361,00:24:24.75,00:24:24.75,"When it comes to just saying words, sometimes you've got to"
362,00:24:27.08,00:24:27.08,take a step of faith. Sometimes you've just got to
363,00:24:29.38,00:24:29.38,"know your gut feeling. >> PROBST: Earl, should this"
364,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50,"game couple down to the most deserving or ""Just as long as I"
365,00:24:35.38,00:24:35.38,"can beat them""? >> Um, trust goes a long way,"
366,00:24:38.92,00:24:38.92,"but at the very end, even your closest friend, you'll still"
367,00:24:42.54,00:24:42.54,"have that one little part of you that's like, ""Well, I might not"
368,00:24:45.88,00:24:45.88,"be able to beat this person, so I might choose this person."""
369,00:24:49.88,00:24:49.88,So it's a lot of careful thinking involved with this-- a
370,00:24:52.00,00:24:52.00,"lot. >> PROBST: Boo, today's immunity"

375,00:25:08.25,00:25:08.25,final over Dreamz or Yau. Dreamz is popular.
376,00:25:13.08,00:25:13.08,He'll get a sympathy vote also. I think Yau has worked hard.
377,00:25:16.17,00:25:16.17,He hasn't made any enemies. So they're going to be very hard
378,00:25:18.54,00:25:18.54,to beat in a vote. >> Let me say something.
379,00:25:22.42,00:25:22.42,"As far as being popular or whatever, I don't know if this"
380,00:25:25.04,00:25:25.04,"is high school or whatever, but as far as trying to get sympathy"
381,00:25:27.92,00:25:27.92,"votes, you know, I tell people my life story to show how far"
382,00:25:30.21,00:25:30.21,"people can make it if they keep trying, not to get no sympathy"
383,00:25:33.00,00:25:33.00,votes. >> I didn't say you were trying
384,00:25:34.96,00:25:34.96,to get sympathy. I just said you will get a
385,00:25:37.25,00:25:37.25,sympathy vote. >> But I'm just saying I don't
386,00:25:39.04,00:25:39.04,do that for sympathy votes or anything like that.

389,00:25:47.46,00:25:47.46,Because Yau-Man is wearing immunity.

391,00:25:51.50,00:25:51.50,me as part of his top four strategy.
392,00:25:54.12,00:25:54.12,That shows me that I'll at least be here probably until the top

397,00:26:07.92,00:26:07.92,">> Pretty much, or he did that all in vain."
398,00:26:10.04,00:26:10.04,He did it all in vain if he throws me away.
399,00:26:13.50,00:26:13.50,>> And I suggested it's probably time to get rid of Dreamz now
400,00:26:16.83,00:26:16.83,"instead of me-- no offense, Dreamz."
401,00:26:19.79,00:26:19.79,">> No, I feel you. >> And I still think that would"

405,00:26:30.04,00:26:30.04,>> That would be up to Yau to make that decision.
406,00:26:31.79,00:26:31.79,>> He would know better than to take Yau.

412,00:26:49.08,00:26:49.08,"you that if I win. I said, ""I don't think anybody"
413,00:26:52.12,00:26:52.12,"else is going to take you to the final two."""

426,00:28:14.12,00:28:14.12,you can play it. Earl is playing the last hidden
427,00:28:27.42,00:28:27.42,immunity idol. All votes cast for Earl will not
428,00:28:30.17,00:28:30.17,"count. All right, once the votes are"

438,00:29:33.58,00:29:33.58,final four. You have two days left in this
439,00:29:36.08,00:29:36.08,game. Head back to camp.
440,00:29:38.12,00:29:38.12,Try to get some sleep. Good night.

442,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,Yau is a strong competitor. He's going to be a hard person
443,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,"to beat, and I respect him on many different levels."
444,00:29:57.54,00:29:57.54,It'd be funny if Dreamz still takes immunity and keeps it.
445,00:30:00.46,00:30:00.46,"I don't think he's going to break his word, but wow, there's"
446,00:30:02.17,00:30:02.17,going to be some fireworks tomorrow.

454,00:30:52.62,00:30:52.62,"ago and the hard times there, and now I'm at the final four,"
455,00:30:58.25,00:30:58.25,"really. >> Very nice, man."

457,00:31:03.71,00:31:03.71,"happening. Yau and myself, we both have the"
458,00:31:06.12,00:31:06.12,"same values and morals in life. Yau is a very, very nice guy,"
459,00:31:09.88,00:31:09.88,and him and I respect one another and admire one another.
460,00:31:13.17,00:31:13.17,And we sincerely know we're going to be friends for a
461,00:31:15.79,00:31:15.79,"lifetime. The older Chinese guy, the young"

463,00:31:21.50,00:31:21.50,That's like Rush Hour. >> Last full day on the island.
464,00:31:28.96,00:31:28.96,>> I sealed my fate. My fate was sealed when I took
465,00:31:31.04,00:31:31.04,the truck. >> And look what you got.
466,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,>> I just want to do it in front of everybody.
467,00:31:36.21,00:31:36.21,I just want my son see me as a man of my word.
468,00:31:39.54,00:31:39.54,"At a reward challenge, Yau won a truck."
469,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,"He gave me the truck in exchange of if I win immunity at four, I"
470,00:31:46.42,00:31:46.42,will give him the necklace at tribal council.
471,00:31:49.71,00:31:49.71,"So today, winning the immunity challenge is very important to"
472,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,me. >> If I had known early how much
473,00:31:59.29,00:31:59.29,"the truck cost, I would have not been so fast to make that deal."
474,00:32:02.04,00:32:02.04,">> Yau-Man, that's what nobody understands."
475,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,It's not just a truck. I seen a man who give away
476,00:32:06.33,00:32:06.33,another something to another man that he don't have.
477,00:32:10.33,00:32:10.33,And it could have been strategy. It could have been whatever.
478,00:32:13.17,00:32:13.17,But it helped me. My game plan is to give Yau the
479,00:32:16.79,00:32:16.79,"necklace, and whatever happens tonight, I'm happy."
480,00:32:30.25,00:32:30.25,>> A bone. >> Bone.

558,00:38:09.04,00:38:09.04,">> Whoo! >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
559,00:39:04.42,00:39:04.42,You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge?
560,00:39:08.25,00:39:08.25,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
561,00:39:10.58,00:39:10.58,"Yau-Man, take back the immunity necklace."
562,00:39:23.96,00:39:23.96,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
563,00:39:28.08,00:39:28.08,Today's immunity challenge will test your threshold for pain and
564,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,"your desire to win this game. For today's challenge, you will"
565,00:39:36.71,00:39:36.71,"lie on a plank on your back with your arms above your head,"
566,00:39:40.79,00:39:40.79,holding on to a wooden handle. The plank is elevated and at an
567,00:39:44.00,00:39:44.00,"angle. Every five minutes, I will"
568,00:39:47.58,00:39:47.58,"increase the angle of the plank, making it more and more"
569,00:39:51.71,00:39:51.71,"difficult to hang on to. If that wasn't enough, water"
570,00:39:55.71,00:39:55.71,"will stream out of a barrel down the plank, making the plank"
571,00:39:59.21,00:39:59.21,"slippery. When you've had enough, you'll"
572,00:40:01.96,00:40:01.96,"let go of the handle, you'll slide down the plank, into the"
573,00:40:05.25,00:40:05.25,water. Last person left hanging on wins
574,00:40:09.67,00:40:09.67,"immunity, is safe at tonight's tribal council, and is"
575,00:40:13.46,00:40:13.46,"guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council, because three of"
576,00:40:18.88,00:40:18.88,you will face the jury and have a shot at the million dollars.
577,00:40:24.58,00:40:24.58,Can't get bigger stakes than this.
578,00:40:27.83,00:40:27.83,Everybody ready? >> Let's do it.
579,00:40:30.38,00:40:30.38,>> I'm ready. >> PROBST: We'll draw for spots.
580,00:40:32.00,00:40:32.00,We'll get started. Everybody good?
581,00:40:45.12,00:40:45.12,"All right, pull the rope, releasing the water."
582,00:40:50.71,00:40:50.71,"All right, this challenge is officially under way."
583,00:41:01.25,00:41:01.25,This is a particularly interesting challenge for Dreamz
584,00:41:04.38,00:41:04.38,"and Yau-Man, going back to the deal for the truck and the"
585,00:41:09.92,00:41:09.92,promise from Dreamz that he would do his best to win
586,00:41:12.75,00:41:12.75,"immunity at four, and if he did, he would give it to Yau-Man."
587,00:41:16.46,00:41:16.46,"With a million dollars this close, we'll see."
588,00:41:25.62,00:41:25.62,"All right, it's time to increase the angle."
589,00:41:48.17,00:41:48.17,You're now hanging at a 40- degree angle.
590,00:41:51.58,00:41:51.58,This will make it a little tougher.
591,00:42:00.71,00:42:00.71,Cassandra starting to slip a little bit.
592,00:42:23.29,00:42:23.29,"We're going to increase the angle some more, another five"
593,00:42:25.38,00:42:25.38,degrees. You are now hanging at a 45-
594,00:42:45.08,00:42:45.08,degree angle. You've now been up there ten
595,00:42:50.04,00:42:50.04,minutes. You're starting to feel it in
596,00:42:52.79,00:42:52.79,your forearms. You're going to have to overcome
597,00:42:59.12,00:42:59.12,"that pain, find somewhere else to take your mind."
598,00:43:13.38,00:43:13.38,Cassandra struggling. Cassandra hanging on by her
599,00:43:17.92,00:43:17.92,fingertips. Cassandra trying to get a grip
600,00:43:24.12,00:43:24.12,"again, trying to pull herself up on a slippery plank, not easy to"
601,00:43:27.50,00:43:27.50,do. Yau-Man readjusts again.
602,00:43:31.96,00:43:31.96,Dreamz sitting very comfortably. Earl looks very comfortable.
603,00:43:42.08,00:43:42.08,You've been up there 15 minutes. We're going to increase the
604,00:43:45.17,00:43:45.17,angle by another five degrees. Here we go.
605,00:43:56.46,00:43:56.46,>> Oh! Oh!
606,00:43:59.04,00:43:59.04,Oh! >> PROBST: Too much for
607,00:44:02.17,00:44:02.17,Cassandra. Cassandra is the first in.
608,00:44:04.42,00:44:04.42,We are still lowering you. Hang tough.
609,00:44:17.17,00:44:17.17,Dreamz struggling. You are now at a 50-degree
610,00:44:21.08,00:44:21.08,"angle. Whatever you're doing, keep"
611,00:44:24.21,00:44:24.21,doing it. Keep refocusing.
612,00:44:26.79,00:44:26.79,Keep reminding. Don't start relaxing and get
613,00:44:31.17,00:44:31.17,lost and let go. Dreamz fighting to find a
614,00:44:36.46,00:44:36.46,comfortable position. Yau-Man has found a nice spot.
615,00:44:42.83,00:44:42.83,Earl repositioning. You've now been up there 20
616,00:44:57.17,00:44:57.17,minutes. We're going to increase the
617,00:45:00.29,00:45:00.29,angle yet again. Here we go.
618,00:45:10.46,00:45:10.46,Hang tough. You are now at a 55-degree
619,00:45:23.83,00:45:23.83,angle. >> PROBST: Dig deep.
620,00:45:30.42,00:45:30.42,Get a good grip. You don't want to fall off now.
621,00:45:37.17,00:45:37.17,Earl fighting to stay in this. Earl cannot hang on any longer.
622,00:45:53.17,00:45:53.17,Earl is the second person out of the challenge.
623,00:45:57.50,00:45:57.50,It is down to Yau-Man and Dreamz fighting for a guaranteed spot
624,00:46:01.83,00:46:01.83,in the final three. Yau-Man is in the water.
625,00:46:23.33,00:46:23.33,Dreamz has just won the last individual immunity.
626,00:46:37.92,00:46:37.92,"Dreamz, come on over. When you needed to, you did."
627,00:46:46.75,00:46:46.75,Dreamz has won the last individual immunity.
628,00:46:50.25,00:46:50.25,"And in doing so, you have fulfilled part of the bargain"
629,00:46:53.12,00:46:53.12,you made with Yau-Man. The first part was you would do
630,00:46:55.71,00:46:55.71,your best to win. The other part was if you did
631,00:46:58.96,00:46:58.96,"win, you would give it to him. Big question is now whether or"
632,00:47:03.08,00:47:03.08,not you'll keep your word. It should be an interesting
633,00:47:05.42,00:47:05.42,afternoon back at camp. Grab your stuff.
634,00:47:07.46,00:47:07.46,Head on back. >> Whew.
635,00:47:47.88,00:47:47.88,">> Oh, okay. >> I really wanted you to get"
636,00:47:49.71,00:47:49.71,it. >> Yeah.
637,00:47:51.21,00:47:51.21,That was a lot of pressure. >> I'm glad you did.
638,00:47:53.88,00:47:53.88,>> A lot of pressure. >> I'm glad you did.
639,00:47:56.79,00:47:56.79,Dreamz ended up winning the big immunity challenge today.
640,00:48:00.67,00:48:00.67,I was glad you got it. The deal that Dreamz has with
641,00:48:03.83,00:48:03.83,"Yau is when there's four people left, if Dreamz was to win the"
642,00:48:08.00,00:48:08.00,"challenge, he has to give up his immunity necklace to Yau."
643,00:48:11.75,00:48:11.75,"Dreamz is definitely faced with an even tougher decision now,"
644,00:48:14.88,00:48:14.88,now that we've been informed that it doesn't go down to a
645,00:48:17.92,00:48:17.92,final two for the judging of the million dollars.
646,00:48:20.79,00:48:20.79,Now it's three people. So that means he could basically
647,00:48:24.12,00:48:24.12,just save himself and go back on his word and he has a chance at
648,00:48:27.08,00:48:27.08,a million dollars. >> Gentlemen's honor.
649,00:48:30.96,00:48:30.96,There's nothing that says he has to do it.
650,00:48:33.04,00:48:33.04,But it's his heart. >> Nothing to worry about.
651,00:48:35.62,00:48:35.62,>> Yeah. He's a good kid.
652,00:48:40.08,00:48:40.08,>> And we're voting him out. >> Uh-huh.
653,00:48:43.12,00:48:43.12,There is no reason for him not to stay on the straight and
654,00:48:47.00,00:48:47.00,"narrow, good path. >> Wow."
655,00:49:10.04,00:49:10.04,>> Why you saying if I change my mind?
656,00:49:20.12,00:49:20.12,">> This game... this game... >> If you change your mind,"
657,00:49:22.12,00:49:22.12,"would you not vote me too? >> Dreamz, I think he's really a"
658,00:49:29.12,00:49:29.12,"man of his word, but from the very beginning, when we brought"
659,00:49:34.71,00:49:34.71,"him into our alliance, I think he was one of the biggest wild"
660,00:49:38.17,00:49:38.17,cards. He seems a little bit out of
661,00:49:40.08,00:49:40.08,"control. But now he is in control, and he"
662,00:49:42.54,00:49:42.54,"made a promise, and it worries me very much."
663,00:49:46.46,00:49:46.46,I like this. I want this.
664,00:49:49.38,00:49:49.38,I'm so close to getting this. I'm so close.
665,00:49:55.38,00:49:55.38,>> So hard to give up a million dollars.
666,00:49:57.50,00:49:57.50,">> I know. >> I worked hard to get here,"
667,00:50:02.25,00:50:02.25,"lied, took out a whole alliance that I was..."
668,00:50:06.33,00:50:06.33,>> Took out a whole alliance. >> I bowed down to a freaking
669,00:50:09.25,00:50:09.25,car. >> You will... you will do the
670,00:50:13.46,00:50:13.46,right thing. >> I want to do the right thing.
671,00:50:15.96,00:50:15.96,>> I believe... I believe... >> If I think of my kid before I
672,00:50:18.50,00:50:18.50,"go up there, believe the right thing's going to happen."
673,00:50:20.92,00:50:20.92,"And I'm going to keep thinking about my kid, so..."
674,00:50:23.21,00:50:23.21,"I'm just saying, just in case, I'm just giving y'all a heads-"
675,00:50:24.67,00:50:24.67,"up. If I do the wrong thing, y'all"
676,00:50:26.04,00:50:26.04,"better vote Yau together, or one of y'all is going home."
677,00:50:35.25,00:50:35.25,"If I was to give the immunity necklace for Yau-Man, in the"
678,00:50:37.58,00:50:37.58,"game, it doesn't benefit me at all."
679,00:50:39.75,00:50:39.75,"As a matter of fact, it eliminates me from the"
680,00:50:41.21,00:50:41.21,competition. I'm good with fourth.
681,00:50:43.54,00:50:43.54,Fourth is good for me. This is my expectation.
682,00:50:45.71,00:50:45.71,I'm good with four. You know what I'm saying?
683,00:50:49.04,00:50:49.04,"After the game, the benefits that I get of giving away the"
684,00:50:52.25,00:50:52.25,immunity necklace is people knowing that I'm really who I
685,00:50:55.54,00:50:55.54,say I am. I am an honorable person.
686,00:50:57.67,00:50:57.67,I am noble. I am a truth teller.
687,00:51:00.83,00:51:00.83,I am Dreamz. This is going to be one of the
688,00:51:06.04,00:51:06.04,most difficult decisions I ever had to make over $1 million or
689,00:51:09.75,00:51:09.75,keeping my word. So $1 million or keeping my
690,00:51:13.08,00:51:13.08,"word, being honorable, or $1 million?"
691,00:51:16.21,00:51:16.21,I can use both of them. So I really don't know what I'm
692,00:51:19.71,00:51:19.71,going to do tonight until it gets time to the nitty-gritty
693,00:51:22.17,00:51:22.17,and I have to do it. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
694,00:51:41.62,00:51:41.62,"the members of the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,"
695,00:51:49.29,00:51:49.29,"Alex, Stacy, and Boo, voted out at the last tribal council."
696,00:52:00.04,00:52:00.04,"First, a little bit of business. For the jury, today at the final"
697,00:52:03.67,00:52:03.67,"immunity challenge, they were informed that there would be"
698,00:52:06.67,00:52:06.67,three people at the final tribal council.
699,00:52:09.75,00:52:09.75,"Tonight, one person will become the ninth and final member of"
700,00:52:12.38,00:52:12.38,the jury. The remaining three will be back
701,00:52:15.08,00:52:15.08,for the final tribal council to try to sway you why they deserve
702,00:52:18.62,00:52:18.62,a million dollars. Let's get to it.
703,00:52:22.12,00:52:22.12,"There's really only one topic to be talked about tonight, the"
704,00:52:25.12,00:52:25.12,negotiation with Yau-Man and Dreamz.
705,00:52:28.00,00:52:28.00,"You guys made a deal. Dreamz said, ""If I'm still here"
706,00:52:31.12,00:52:31.12,"and I win the final four immunity, I will give it to you,"
707,00:52:33.50,00:52:33.50,"Yau-Man."" Dreamz, you did win it."
708,00:52:36.46,00:52:36.46,You're this close to having a shot at a million bucks.
709,00:52:40.04,00:52:40.04,Do you start weighing your word versus this is a game?
710,00:52:44.29,00:52:44.29,">> You know, in my head, I weighed it out, and this is a"
711,00:52:47.29,00:52:47.29,"game of people lying, people deceiving, people tricking"
712,00:52:50.62,00:52:50.62,"people, but when your humanity side is there, you forget all"
713,00:52:54.25,00:52:54.25,"about that, and you try to do it according to your friendships,"
714,00:52:57.25,00:52:57.25,you know? >> PROBST: So where does
715,00:52:59.83,00:52:59.83,humanity fall in this situation? When you were making the deal
716,00:53:03.17,00:53:03.17,"for the car, you really wanted the car."
717,00:53:06.21,00:53:06.21,Now it's time to pay back. It's not so easy.
718,00:53:09.25,00:53:09.25,">> Oh, no, it's not easy at all, because it's a million dollars,"
719,00:53:12.08,00:53:12.08,"point blank, you know what I mean?"
720,00:53:13.92,00:53:13.92,"At the time, I really wanted the truck, and I still want the"
721,00:53:15.75,00:53:15.75,"truck. You know, the truck is"
722,00:53:17.71,00:53:17.71,"beautiful, and Yau-Man did that for me."
723,00:53:20.38,00:53:20.38,"But he did it out of strategy, you know?"
724,00:53:22.42,00:53:22.42,"If I give Yau-Man the idle, I mean, I go home tonight."
725,00:53:27.17,00:53:27.17,">> PROBST: Okay, now, that seems like a big jump to take."
726,00:53:29.25,00:53:29.25,There are a lot of scenarios that don't involve you being
727,00:53:30.96,00:53:30.96,voted out. >> I pretty much know if I give
728,00:53:33.58,00:53:33.58,"Yau-Man the idol, I'm going to be voted out, but I'm prepared"
729,00:53:35.88,00:53:35.88,"for that. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, let's get"
730,00:53:37.54,00:53:37.54,you in on this. Do you and Dreamz talk about
731,00:53:39.12,00:53:39.12,"this? Do you go up and say, ""Okay,"
732,00:53:40.83,00:53:40.83,what's the deal? You going to give it to me?
733,00:53:42.46,00:53:42.46,"Because I'd like it now."" >> No, I just congratulated him"
734,00:53:45.71,00:53:45.71,on his win. I don't think he needs any
735,00:53:48.75,00:53:48.75,"encouragement or discouragement or any meddling on my part, and"
736,00:53:52.54,00:53:52.54,I was wasn't going to do any campaigning.
737,00:53:54.75,00:53:54.75,I left him alone to his own volition to decide.
738,00:53:58.67,00:53:58.67,">> PROBST: What's your gut telling you, Yau-Man, about"
739,00:54:00.62,00:54:00.62,whether or not Dreamz is going to live up to this part of the
740,00:54:02.71,00:54:02.71,bargain? >> Having known him for just a
741,00:54:05.38,00:54:05.38,"short time, my gut feeling is that he will live up to his"
742,00:54:08.88,00:54:08.88,word. And I don't say that easily for
743,00:54:12.29,00:54:12.29,"other people. >> PROBST: Cassandra, what do"
744,00:54:15.58,00:54:15.58,"you think Dreamz should do? >> Um, Dreamz is in a difficult"
745,00:54:18.62,00:54:18.62,"situation, and I agree that it was a gamble, and I really can't"
746,00:54:23.08,00:54:23.08,even imagine being in his situation.
747,00:54:26.96,00:54:26.96,">> PROBST: Earl, did you have any conversation at all with"
748,00:54:29.04,00:54:29.04,"Dreamz about this? >> No, we all pretty much just"
749,00:54:31.62,00:54:31.62,"left him alone. I mean, it's such a difficult"
750,00:54:33.88,00:54:33.88,decision to decide between integrity or the game.
751,00:54:37.08,00:54:37.08,What's your priority? What matters to you the most as
752,00:54:39.21,00:54:39.21,a person? >> PROBST: What would do you?
753,00:54:41.25,00:54:41.25,>> I don't think I would have been in this situation.
754,00:54:44.83,00:54:44.83,">> PROBST: So, Dreamz, your fear is that if you give Yau-Man the"
755,00:54:47.21,00:54:47.21,"idol, you'll then turn around and be voted out."
756,00:54:50.12,00:54:50.12,">> I know if I give him the necklace, I'm gone."
757,00:54:52.17,00:54:52.17,That's just all part of the game.
758,00:54:54.21,00:54:54.21,But what we didn't know was that three of us was going to be
759,00:54:56.79,00:54:56.79,"talking to the jury. That's what we didn't know, and"
760,00:54:58.96,00:54:58.96,"that's what makes everything so down to the... to the bone,"
761,00:55:02.08,00:55:02.08,Jeff. I can't even explain it.
762,00:55:04.21,00:55:04.21,"It's just one of the hardest things I ever have to do, and it"
763,00:55:06.46,00:55:06.46,"sucks, Jeff. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, last chance"
764,00:55:12.08,00:55:12.08,before we go to the vote to say anything to Dreamz.
765,00:55:17.46,00:55:17.46,">> Well, Dreamz, I hope you think... thought it over, and I"
766,00:55:22.67,00:55:22.67,"hope you live up to your word, but you know, whatever you do,"
767,00:55:26.17,00:55:26.17,"you have to live with it. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
768,00:55:34.33,00:55:34.33,to get to one of the biggest votes of this season.
769,00:55:37.58,00:55:37.58,"Before we do, Dreamz, you have the immunity necklace."
770,00:55:42.79,00:55:42.79,It is yours to keep or to assign to anyone else you want.
771,00:55:46.54,00:55:46.54,What are you going to do with it?
772,00:56:07.08,00:56:07.08,>> I'm going to keep it. >> PROBST: Dreamz is going to
773,00:56:17.42,00:56:17.42,keep the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Dreamz.
774,00:56:21.62,00:56:21.62,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
775,00:56:25.04,00:56:25.04,"Earl, you're up. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
776,00:57:08.67,00:57:08.67,votes. >> PROBST: Once the votes are
777,00:57:30.00,00:57:30.00,"read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
778,00:57:31.88,00:57:31.88,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
779,00:57:34.17,00:57:34.17,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Cassandra."
780,00:57:44.96,00:57:44.96,"Yau-Man. One vote Cassandra, one vote"
781,00:57:47.21,00:57:47.21,Yau-Man. Yau-Man.
782,00:57:53.04,00:57:53.04,"Two votes Yau-Man, one vote Cassandra, one vote left."
783,00:58:03.17,00:58:03.17,"15th person voted out and the ninth member of our jury, Yau-"
784,00:58:05.88,00:58:05.88,Man. Bring me your torch.
785,00:58:18.83,00:58:18.83,"Yau-Man, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
786,00:58:24.33,00:58:24.33,">> Good luck. >> PROBST: Well, after 38 days,"
787,00:58:42.71,00:58:42.71,you've gone as far as you can go in this game.
788,00:58:45.54,00:58:45.54,The power now shifts to the jury.
789,00:58:48.08,00:58:48.08,"Tomorrow, they will decide which one of the three of you they"
790,00:58:50.88,00:58:50.88,feel is most deserving of the million dollars and the title of
791,00:58:53.79,00:58:53.79,sole survivor. You have one more night here in
792,00:58:56.25,00:58:56.25,Fiji. Enjoy it.
793,00:58:58.04,00:58:58.04,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
794,00:58:59.62,00:58:59.62,"Good night. >> Well, sorry, Dreamz."
795,00:59:08.92,00:59:08.92,You did not see fit to live up to your end of the bargain.
796,00:59:12.12,00:59:12.12,Enjoy the truck. I am very surprised that Earl
797,00:59:14.46,00:59:14.46,voted me out today. He must have his reasons for it.
798,00:59:18.21,00:59:18.21,"I don't understand why, but I'm glad I could hold my own, and to"
799,00:59:21.21,00:59:21.21,"make it this far is quite an accomplishment, and I'm very"
800,00:59:24.17,00:59:24.17,proud of it. >> It is a game.
801,01:00:00.92,01:00:00.92,It was just a game. That's it.
802,01:00:04.04,01:00:04.04,"How you feeling, Earl, big Earl, now?"
803,01:00:08.00,01:00:08.00,>> I'm good. >> That's right.
804,01:00:11.04,01:00:11.04,Everybody's good. >> That jury is going to rip me
805,01:00:18.88,01:00:18.88,up real nice too. >> They're going to look like I
806,01:00:20.67,01:00:20.67,turned on Yau big time. Dreamz made a very surprising
807,01:00:24.38,01:00:24.38,decision. He decided not to give Yau the
808,01:00:28.21,01:00:28.21,immunity idol. He decided to go back on his
809,01:00:29.62,01:00:29.62,word. >> This ain't nothing like I am
810,01:00:31.92,01:00:31.92,at home. It hurt me.
811,01:00:33.58,01:00:33.58,"It hurt me tonight to have to do that, but I knew if I didn't do"
812,01:00:37.17,01:00:37.17,"it, I'd be on the jury right now, with no chance at all of"
813,01:00:40.08,01:00:40.08,"winning a million dollars. >> When it all went down, I"
814,01:00:42.96,01:00:42.96,"actually was pissed. You know, in the back of my"
815,01:00:45.12,01:00:45.12,"mind, I said, ""Man, I can't believe I'm actually writing"
816,01:00:47.21,01:00:47.21,"down Yau-Man's name, who's trusted me, and I've trusted him"
817,01:00:49.25,01:00:49.25,"through this whole game."" So that was pretty difficult."
818,01:00:53.21,01:00:53.21,"Yau-Man, him and I have been through a lot, and I would hope"
819,01:00:55.79,01:00:55.79,"that, you know, on that jury I still have his vote, that he"
820,01:00:58.67,01:00:58.67,"won't hold it against me, and he knows I was just playing the"
821,01:01:00.96,01:01:00.96,"game. >> Well, we're still here, to"
822,01:01:04.12,01:01:04.12,the bloody end. The decision tonight that I made
823,01:01:08.50,01:01:08.50,with Yau is not going to be weighing on my mind.
824,01:01:10.79,01:01:10.79,I have no regrets. I think I did everything the
825,01:01:12.46,01:01:12.46,"right way, like I was supposed to."
826,01:01:14.21,01:01:14.21,"I planned it out step by step, and I have no regrets."
827,01:01:17.08,01:01:17.08,I think everything worked out perfect.
828,01:01:26.12,01:01:26.12,"Like I said, I take it back to the old concept of it's a game,"
829,01:01:29.08,01:01:29.08,and everybody else lied and cheated and slithered their way
830,01:01:32.29,01:01:32.29,"through the game, biting each other, snakes, rats, weasels."
831,01:01:35.75,01:01:35.75,So it's not going to play on my mind.
832,01:01:38.08,01:01:38.08,"I'm just going to sleep comfortable tonight, knowing"
833,01:01:39.83,01:01:39.83,that I got a shot at a million dollars tomorrow.
834,01:02:02.17,01:02:02.17,">> Day 39, last day, and we're all still here."
835,01:02:08.33,01:02:08.33,>> We're ecstatic. >> Ecstatic.
836,01:02:10.08,01:02:10.08,">> Ecstatic, that's our word. >> Ecstatic."
837,01:02:12.21,01:02:12.21,>> So I'm putting the smiley face on now.
838,01:02:14.38,01:02:14.38,"We figure by 39, we deserve a big smile."
839,01:02:18.79,01:02:18.79,We have spent 39 full days in the same underwear.
840,01:02:23.58,01:02:23.58,>> The same funk. >> In the same funk.
841,01:02:25.50,01:02:25.50,"I discarded my underwear, though, about three weeks ago."
842,01:02:29.67,01:02:29.67,">> This is the last day on this island, game over, and I'm"
843,01:02:36.42,01:02:36.42,happy. The plan for today is to relish
844,01:02:47.83,01:02:47.83,"in the moment, and we're celebrating just by being happy."
845,01:02:51.46,01:02:51.46,"You know, we don't have a lot of energy to do cartwheels and"
846,01:02:54.04,01:02:54.04,jumping jacks and run around the island.
847,01:02:57.12,01:02:57.12,We just don't have the energy for that.
848,01:02:58.79,01:02:58.79,"But occasionally we look at each other and just nod like, ""We did"
849,01:03:02.96,01:03:02.96,"it."" >> Food!"
850,01:03:05.25,01:03:05.25,">> No, it's not. >> A mirage!"
851,01:03:07.08,01:03:07.08,">> No, it's not. Ah!"
852,01:03:13.12,01:03:13.12,>> Whew! >> Whew!
853,01:03:14.75,01:03:14.75,>> Whew! >> Day 39.
854,01:03:17.12,01:03:17.12,>> Day 39. >> Big deal.
855,01:03:19.08,01:03:19.08,">> A pretty big deal. >> ""Take a deep breath and sigh,"
856,01:03:22.04,01:03:22.04,then use these tools to celebrate when some gifts fall
857,01:03:25.50,01:03:25.50,"from the sky."" Whoo!"
858,01:03:28.25,01:03:28.25,">> Look it. >> Ooh, yes!"
859,01:03:42.50,01:03:42.50,>> Right here. >> Over here.
860,01:03:46.42,01:03:46.42,"( Cassandra yelling ) >> Dreamz, come on!"
861,01:03:57.96,01:03:57.96,"Dreamz, come on! Hm."
862,01:04:04.08,01:04:04.08,>> He missed the x. >> He's lucky I can't swim.
863,01:04:06.88,01:04:06.88,"I'd get out there and get that. All right, big papa, bring back"
864,01:04:11.08,01:04:11.08,the food. >> I'm going to get the food.
865,01:04:12.83,01:04:12.83,"I got to feed my family. >> I can't believe, as hungry as"
866,01:04:17.79,01:04:17.79,"I am, there's some food in the ocean, floating."
867,01:04:22.75,01:04:22.75,I said they're lucky I can't swim.
868,01:04:24.62,01:04:24.62,"I'd put on those fins, and that would be here by now."
869,01:04:34.83,01:04:34.83,>> Huh? >> I look forward to everything
870,01:04:37.50,01:04:37.50,and the wonderful breakfast amongst my three... my... what
871,01:04:42.25,01:04:42.25,"are we, the three what? >> Amigos."
872,01:04:44.25,01:04:44.25,>> Three amigos. >> We're the three amigos.
873,01:04:46.17,01:04:46.17,We were the core four. Now we're the three amigos.
874,01:04:48.58,01:04:48.58,>> So I am feeling really excited.
875,01:04:52.62,01:04:52.62,"We're celebrating, but I just feel very grateful that I made"
876,01:04:57.54,01:04:57.54,it this far. I made it with some great
877,01:04:59.38,01:04:59.38,"people, Earl and Dreamz. >> My mother would be so"
878,01:05:02.08,01:05:02.08,embarrassed. >> She will be when she sees it.
879,01:05:06.21,01:05:06.21,>> Drinking syrup out of a champagne glass and eating
880,01:05:08.79,01:05:08.79,strawberry jam right out of the jar.
881,01:05:10.71,01:05:10.71,">> I mean, we're all very excited and happy to have played"
882,01:05:13.12,01:05:13.12,the game and made it through the game.
883,01:05:15.17,01:05:15.17,"After all, I was the one that couldn't swim, not very"
884,01:05:18.08,01:05:18.08,"athletic, the older lady. So I felt initially like odds"
885,01:05:23.25,01:05:23.25,"were definitely stacked against me, but I'm still here."
886,01:05:30.08,01:05:30.08,>> We turned this mother out. >> We are making an exit bonfire
887,01:05:34.17,01:05:34.17,before we go to tribal council. All these palm fronds I had to
888,01:05:37.21,01:05:37.21,"sleep on, burned. >> Burned."
889,01:05:39.21,01:05:39.21,">> All this stuff, burned. >> Burned."
890,01:05:41.25,01:05:41.25,">> That log, burned. >> Burned."
891,01:05:43.33,01:05:43.33,">> Even this case, this wooden case with the food in it, even"
892,01:05:46.08,01:05:46.08,"though that was good, burned. >> Burned."
893,01:05:48.08,01:05:48.08,>> Everything gets burned. >> Everything must go.
894,01:05:50.62,01:05:50.62,It's a liquidation sale. Everything must go.
895,01:05:52.58,01:05:52.58,>> It's a fire sale. >> I think being homeless helped
896,01:06:02.58,01:06:02.58,me through this whole situation of roughing it.
897,01:06:06.08,01:06:06.08,">> Yeah, let it burn. >> And actually having a shot at"
898,01:06:10.08,01:06:10.08,"a million dollars, me, myself, and how my whole family grew up,"
899,01:06:13.92,01:06:13.92,this is more than words can explain.
900,01:06:15.67,01:06:15.67,It's... it's too... it's just crazy.
901,01:06:20.08,01:06:20.08,">> Somebody's dirty draws. I don't know who they belong to,"
902,01:06:23.04,01:06:23.04,but that's really got to burn. >> Burn.
903,01:06:26.58,01:06:26.58,And now I feel that it's over. I feel that it's over.
904,01:06:29.04,01:06:29.04,It's the last day. The struggle is over.
905,01:06:30.92,01:06:30.92,The pain is over. The game is over.
906,01:06:33.04,01:06:33.04,So right now I feel that I am on top of the world.
907,01:06:35.67,01:06:35.67,I feel that... I feel like I'm standing next to Oprah.
908,01:06:42.92,01:06:42.92,>> I'm pretty proud of myself for making it this far.
909,01:06:45.83,01:06:45.83,"This is one of the highest peaks of my life, because I've"
910,01:06:48.21,01:06:48.21,"challenged myself so much in this game, and I made it all the"
911,01:06:51.21,01:06:51.21,"way through, just as planned. I mean, it's a cool experience."
912,01:06:54.54,01:06:54.54,"You won't know until you do it, till you give up everything and"
913,01:06:57.04,01:06:57.04,your lifestyle and come here and get in the dirt and the mud and
914,01:07:00.54,01:07:00.54,"the grind and make it happen, still be yourself, be strong,"
915,01:07:04.96,01:07:04.96,"see what you're made of, see if you're really a man, or a"
916,01:07:07.62,01:07:07.62,woman-- the experience of a lifetime.
917,01:08:34.17,01:08:34.17,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in your jury: Rocky, Lisi,"
918,01:08:39.04,01:08:39.04,"Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie, Alex, Stacy, Boo, and Yau-Man, voted"
919,01:08:52.08,01:08:52.08,out at the last tribal council. Welcome to your final tribal
920,01:09:01.08,01:09:01.08,council. You have outlasted 16 other
921,01:09:04.83,01:09:04.83,people in this game. Now the power in this game
922,01:09:08.38,01:09:08.38,shifts from the three of you over to the jury.
923,01:09:12.04,01:09:12.04,Nine people that you had a hand either directly or indirectly in
924,01:09:15.75,01:09:15.75,voting out of this game now hold your fate in their hands.
925,01:09:19.83,01:09:19.83,"Tonight, they will decide who they think is most deserving of"
926,01:09:22.58,01:09:22.58,the title of sole survivor and the million dollars that goes
927,01:09:25.04,01:09:25.04,with it. Here's how it's going to work.
928,01:09:27.46,01:09:27.46,You will each get a chance to make an opening statement.
929,01:09:30.21,01:09:30.21,This is your opportunity to convince the jury that you are
930,01:09:34.08,01:09:34.08,the person most deserving. The jury will then get a chance
931,01:09:37.08,01:09:37.08,to address you. After hearing everything that's
932,01:09:39.75,01:09:39.75,"been said, we will get to the final vote."
933,01:09:42.62,01:09:42.62,Let's get started. Opening statements.
934,01:09:44.92,01:09:44.92,"Earl. >> Um, well, first I want to say"
935,01:09:48.42,01:09:48.42,"hello, good to see everybody. About me, I played an honest and"
936,01:09:53.62,01:09:53.62,clean game. I know there's been talk of rats
937,01:09:56.88,01:09:56.88,"and snakes in this game, but that just didn't work for me."
938,01:09:59.42,01:09:59.42,"I didn't want to be that. So I tried to take the hard way,"
939,01:10:02.17,01:10:02.17,which is just try to make the right moves and put myself in
940,01:10:04.67,01:10:04.67,the right position to where I didn't have to sacrifice a lot
941,01:10:07.71,01:10:07.71,"of integrity. If you think about it, I was"
942,01:10:10.67,01:10:10.67,"somebody, no one ever wrote my name down to get voted off, and"
943,01:10:14.12,01:10:14.12,"I never had to win an immunity challenge, and I'm here in the"
944,01:10:16.71,01:10:16.71,"finals. So I think that says a lot, that"
945,01:10:19.33,01:10:19.33,"I played a pretty intelligent game, very smart, and now I'm"
946,01:10:22.50,01:10:22.50,"here, and hopefully... and you know, I don't want the sympathy"
947,01:10:25.50,01:10:25.50,vote or underdog vote. I want the respect vote.
948,01:10:27.67,01:10:27.67,"You know, I just feel I'm very deserving of this, and I hope"
949,01:10:29.92,01:10:29.92,that you guys feel that way too. >> PROBST: Cassandra.
950,01:10:35.29,01:10:35.29,">> Um, I just first want to say thank you to everyone on the"
951,01:10:38.08,01:10:38.08,"jury. I started the game pretty slow,"
952,01:10:41.21,01:10:41.21,"not really feeling like I was in the hub of it, but I wanted to"
953,01:10:45.75,01:10:45.75,make sure that throughout the game that I made everyone feel
954,01:10:48.62,01:10:48.62,"like they had someone they can come talk to, that they can"
955,01:10:51.33,01:10:51.33,befriend. And I was fortunate enough to
956,01:10:55.21,01:10:55.21,get with an alliance and stay firm.
957,01:10:58.12,01:10:58.12,I never wavered. I tried to stay as positive as
958,01:11:01.54,01:11:01.54,"possible throughout the whole game, and I'm hoping that people"
959,01:11:05.04,01:11:05.04,"can respect that, and I just hope, at the end of the day,"
960,01:11:08.83,01:11:08.83,that we can all still be friends.
961,01:11:12.58,01:11:12.58,">> PROBST: Dreamz. >> Well, I ain't going to make"
962,01:11:16.04,01:11:16.04,this as long. I'm just going to get to the
963,01:11:17.46,01:11:17.46,point. I'm sure everybody knows my life
964,01:11:19.17,01:11:19.17,"story, because I opened up to everybody, just to see who would"
965,01:11:21.79,01:11:21.79,"open back up, not for the game strategy, because I was, like,"
966,01:11:25.50,01:11:25.50,getting to know people. And the people that I did get to
967,01:11:29.21,01:11:29.21,"know, y'all know me. Y'all know my heart."
968,01:11:30.88,01:11:30.88,Y'all know what I'd do with the money.
969,01:11:32.25,01:11:32.25,"Y'all know everything about me pretty much, because I wear it"
970,01:11:34.12,01:11:34.12,on my chest. And I hope y'all vote count and
971,01:11:37.96,01:11:37.96,helps me and helps my life and helps me help other people.
972,01:11:44.33,01:11:44.33,">> PROBST: All right, jury, in a moment, you're going to get your"
973,01:11:46.58,01:11:46.58,"first chance to address Earl, Cassandra, and Dreamz."
974,01:11:50.29,01:11:50.29,I'll give you a minute to think about what you want to say.
975,01:12:07.25,01:12:07.25,">> PROBST: Okay, jury, you're now going to get your first"
976,01:12:09.71,01:12:09.71,"chance to address Earl, Cassandra, and Dreamz."
977,01:12:13.08,01:12:13.08,You can address any of them or all of them.
978,01:12:16.17,01:12:16.17,"It's up to you. Michelle, get us started."
979,01:12:23.21,01:12:23.21,">> All right, well, you guys already made your personal"
980,01:12:25.67,01:12:25.67,"statements, and after all that, this is a little bit more"
981,01:12:28.67,01:12:28.67,objective. I was just wondering what you
982,01:12:31.46,01:12:31.46,think was the biggest hardship and obstacle that you were faced
983,01:12:35.25,01:12:35.25,"with, you know, whether it be sleeping in the dirt or"
984,01:12:37.21,01:12:37.21,"starving, because I think you have to work pretty hard for a"
985,01:12:40.08,01:12:40.08,"million bucks. So, Dreamz?"
986,01:12:43.33,01:12:43.33,">> Sleeping in the dirt, starving, that's really nothing"
987,01:12:45.67,01:12:45.67,"to me, because I grew up having to do that."
988,01:12:48.33,01:12:48.33,So that was just something that I have to repeat in my life.
989,01:12:51.71,01:12:51.71,I think the hardest thing was thirst.
990,01:12:53.58,01:12:53.58,"You know, you could be hungry as you want to be in the city, but"
991,01:12:56.50,01:12:56.50,"there's always water somewhere, out of the... you know what I"
992,01:12:58.88,01:12:58.88,mean?-- out of the faucet. So being thirsty and then having
993,01:13:01.25,01:13:01.25,"to do challenges, that was the hard part for me."
994,01:13:04.00,01:13:04.00,">> Okay. Cassandra, what do you think the"
995,01:13:05.75,01:13:05.75,hardest thing that you had to go through was?
996,01:13:08.21,01:13:08.21,>> The biggest obstacle for me being in Survivor was overcoming
997,01:13:11.67,01:13:11.67,"my inability to swim. For me, that was my biggest"
998,01:13:14.67,01:13:14.67,obstacle in the game. >> Do you think your fear of
999,01:13:17.21,01:13:17.21,water earns you a million dollars?
1000,01:13:20.04,01:13:20.04,">> You know, the combination of my fear of water and really"
1001,01:13:23.75,01:13:23.75,"opening myself up to people and forming an alliance, that was an"
1002,01:13:27.25,01:13:27.25,"obstacle for me, too, initially. >> Okay."
1003,01:13:30.21,01:13:30.21,Earl? >> Being the only original Ravu
1004,01:13:33.17,01:13:33.17,"member up here, everybody who was at Ravu knows about"
1005,01:13:36.83,01:13:36.83,"suffering-- no water, no food, and still pushing yourself,"
1006,01:13:40.67,01:13:40.67,"pushing, pushing, pushing. Then you get sent to Exile"
1007,01:13:43.92,01:13:43.92,"Island, and that's total suffering."
1008,01:13:46.33,01:13:46.33,"So I've suffered more than anybody, I think, as far as"
1009,01:13:50.12,01:13:50.12,"that, but I got through it. >> All right."
1010,01:13:52.12,01:13:52.12,"Thanks, guys. >> PROBST: Thanks, Michelle."
1011,01:13:54.08,01:13:54.08,Edgardo. >> All right.
1012,01:13:59.50,01:13:59.50,I have one question. This question is for Earl.
1013,01:14:03.25,01:14:03.25,"Earl, how do you found out who had the immunity idol from the"
1014,01:14:06.79,01:14:06.79,other alliance? >> Dreamz.
1015,01:14:19.12,01:14:19.12,>> That's it. >> PROBST: Mookie.
1016,01:14:25.04,01:14:25.04,">> Positive light, congratulations to you three for"
1017,01:14:27.96,01:14:27.96,"making it this far, first. Second, Dreamz, did you tell"
1018,01:14:32.67,01:14:32.67,anyone about the immunity idol that I found?
1019,01:14:35.12,01:14:35.12,">> Yes, I did. >> Would you consider that"
1020,01:14:37.71,01:14:37.71,"betrayal? >> No, I'd say it's lying."
1021,01:14:43.00,01:14:43.00,>> So that's not betraying your alliance?
1022,01:14:45.33,01:14:45.33,"Telling the biggest secret of an alliance to another alliance,"
1023,01:14:48.12,01:14:48.12,you don't consider that betrayal?
1024,01:14:50.17,01:14:50.17,">> Well, if that's how you consider betrayal, I guess it's"
1025,01:14:52.46,01:14:52.46,"betrayal in your eyes. To me, it's just a lie."
1026,01:14:54.38,01:14:54.38,It's just a con. It's just a deceit and...
1027,01:14:56.88,01:14:56.88,">> Okay, okay. Word of advice for you guys,"
1028,01:14:59.62,01:14:59.62,"tonight is not the time to lie, and tonight is not the time to"
1029,01:15:02.04,01:15:02.04,get caught up in a lie. So just a word of advice for you
1030,01:15:04.38,01:15:04.38,"guys. >> PROBST: Thanks, Mookie."
1031,01:15:08.62,01:15:08.62,Alex. >> Okay.
1032,01:15:15.92,01:15:15.92,"Cassandra, please describe a moment that you grappled the"
1033,01:15:21.25,01:15:21.25,most with maintaining your integrity.
1034,01:15:25.29,01:15:25.29,">> Um, I think the biggest struggle I had with my integrity"
1035,01:15:28.04,01:15:28.04,"was once, in the beginning of the game, I walked in on a"
1036,01:15:30.21,01:15:30.21,"conversation you had with Boo, where it involved me, and I had"
1037,01:15:34.71,01:15:34.71,to really decide if I was going to stay there and listen or if I
1038,01:15:38.38,01:15:38.38,would walk away. >> Can you describe to me the
1039,01:15:40.08,01:15:40.08,conversation? >> It was basically discussing
1040,01:15:42.62,01:15:42.62,eliminating me or Dreamz. >> One of two things is going
1041,01:15:46.88,01:15:46.88,"on, Cassandra. One, you're lying to me right"
1042,01:15:49.67,01:15:49.67,"now, and that was not, in fact, the moment you struggled with"
1043,01:15:52.88,01:15:52.88,"most, or two, you cared very little, taking Stacy, pretending"
1044,01:15:58.08,01:15:58.08,"to like her, comforting her and nurturing her to use her vote to"
1045,01:16:02.08,01:16:02.08,then quickly discard her when she was no longer of any use to
1046,01:16:04.08,01:16:04.08,"you, not two votes later. So which is it?"
1047,01:16:07.58,01:16:07.58,">> Well, basically, I think you have the situation wrong, and"
1048,01:16:09.54,01:16:09.54,"hopefully Stacy can clarify it. >> Stop, stop, stop, stop."
1049,01:16:11.92,01:16:11.92,"No, stop, I get to talk. >> You didn't let me finish."
1050,01:16:14.17,01:16:14.17,">> It doesn't matter, Cassandra. >> Stacy..."
1051,01:16:15.79,01:16:15.79,">> I have enough information. >> No, I think that, you know, I"
1052,01:16:18.25,01:16:18.25,should be able to respond to your question.
1053,01:16:19.62,01:16:19.62,">> No, I think you're mistaken. You are mistaken, Cassandra."
1054,01:16:21.25,01:16:21.25,"I said stop talking. >> Well, Stacy came to me, and"
1055,01:16:23.29,01:16:23.29,"she asked me... >> Is that not clear to you,"
1056,01:16:24.71,01:16:24.71,"Cassandra, that I said stop talking?"
1057,01:16:26.08,01:16:26.08,Maybe I should say it in Spanish.
1058,01:16:27.08,01:16:27.08,"Edgaro, you want to translate? No, I think we're good."
1059,01:16:29.79,01:16:29.79,Stop talking. On to Dreamz.
1060,01:16:32.21,01:16:32.21,"Given that you said specifically your goals are to help kids,"
1061,01:16:36.04,01:16:36.04,"explain to me this, riddle me this, Dreamz."
1062,01:16:38.38,01:16:38.38,"You cheat, you lie, you back- stab to succeed."
1063,01:16:43.21,01:16:43.21,Why would the rats and the snakes be the role models to the
1064,01:16:46.04,01:16:46.04,kids you and I are trying to help?
1065,01:16:48.21,01:16:48.21,Explain to me why I would endorse that view if the world?
1066,01:16:50.75,01:16:50.75,>> Because it's part of the game.
1067,01:16:52.75,01:16:52.75,This ain't part of the real world.
1068,01:16:54.08,01:16:54.08,This is.. there's two separations.
1069,01:16:55.67,01:16:55.67,"This is this game. This game is based on cons,"
1070,01:16:58.50,01:16:58.50,"lies, and deceit. The real world, you do that"
1071,01:17:01.33,01:17:01.33,"stuff, and you end up paying the consequences."
1072,01:17:03.62,01:17:03.62,">> All right, fair enough. Well, I would wish you luck, and"
1073,01:17:06.21,01:17:06.21,"unlike you, I'm a man of my word, so I don't wish you any"
1074,01:17:08.25,01:17:08.25,luck at all. >> Thank you.
1075,01:17:10.08,01:17:10.08,">> Can't hide from karma forever, ""my friend."""
1076,01:17:15.17,01:17:15.17,">> PROBST: Lisi, you're up. >> Whew."
1077,01:17:22.46,01:17:22.46,"All right, let's see. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a"
1078,01:17:27.04,01:17:27.04,"liar by the toe. If he hollers, let him go-- not"
1079,01:17:31.17,01:17:31.17,"really. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe."
1080,01:17:34.17,01:17:34.17,"Cassandra, can I see your water shoes?"
1081,01:17:37.46,01:17:37.46,">> Sure. >> All right, those are the"
1082,01:17:42.62,01:17:42.62,worst-looking water shoes I've ever seen.
1083,01:17:46.71,01:17:46.71,It's just telling me that you were completely unprepared to
1084,01:17:49.88,01:17:49.88,play this game. Would you agree with that?
1085,01:17:52.67,01:17:52.67,">> No, it's day 39, and I'm still here."
1086,01:17:55.00,01:17:55.00,"These shoes are still here, and you know..."
1087,01:17:57.25,01:17:57.25,>> Okay. >> That's all I can say.
1088,01:17:59.29,01:17:59.29,I don't see the relevance in the question.
1089,01:18:01.25,01:18:01.25,>> I brought up the shoes because you were in over your
1090,01:18:04.38,01:18:04.38,"head. So I'm thinking for 39 days, she"
1091,01:18:08.17,01:18:08.17,made it because... greed. I think greed is what really
1092,01:18:14.25,01:18:14.25,"fueled everything. Would you agree with that, yes"
1093,01:18:17.29,01:18:17.29,"or no? >> No, I don't agree with that."
1094,01:18:19.17,01:18:19.17,"I mean, I'm not surprised to hear that comment from you."
1095,01:18:21.79,01:18:21.79,My purpose for being on the island was to prove some things
1096,01:18:24.12,01:18:24.12,to myself. >> So greed never propelled you?
1097,01:18:26.21,01:18:26.21,>> Greed never propelled me. >> So what did?
1098,01:18:28.29,01:18:28.29,"What did, your love of the outdoors?"
1099,01:18:30.50,01:18:30.50,">> Of course wanting to win a million dollars, like everyone."
1100,01:18:32.83,01:18:32.83,">> Ah, oh-- what? >> And... but it wasn't that I"
1101,01:18:35.62,01:18:35.62,sat there every day... >> Say that... say that one more
1102,01:18:37.42,01:18:37.42,time. >> We're all here for the
1103,01:18:38.96,01:18:38.96,"million dollars, but I didn't think every day of the game I'm"
1104,01:18:40.62,01:18:40.62,willing to do anything for the million dollars...
1105,01:18:42.12,01:18:42.12,">> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We're playing."

1108,01:18:47.12,01:18:47.12,"zeroes there are in a million. >> Six, enough to keep"
1109,01:18:51.08,01:18:51.08,somebody's life running and to help a lot of people.
1110,01:18:54.21,01:18:54.21,>> Say that one more time. >> Enough to keep somebody's
1111,01:18:56.50,01:18:56.50,"life running... >> No, no, the number of zeroes."
1112,01:18:58.12,01:18:58.12,">> It's six. >> Good, good."
1113,01:19:02.00,01:19:02.00,Okay. >> Do you think I'm stupid?
1114,01:19:04.54,01:19:04.54,"Let me ask you that question. >> No, no."
1115,01:19:06.21,01:19:06.21,"No, no, hey, it's a question. I'm part of the jury."
1116,01:19:08.29,01:19:08.29,"This is part of my game. >> Okay, go ahead."
1117,01:19:11.12,01:19:11.12,">> Just like you played your game, and you do what you have"
1118,01:19:13.08,01:19:13.08,"to do with the game, I get that opportunity too."
1119,01:19:17.08,01:19:17.08,"Okay, Earl, yesterday, when Yau got voted off, you did a whole"
1120,01:19:22.88,01:19:22.88,show for the jury. I saw it.
1121,01:19:25.79,01:19:25.79,"You... that did... you gave me that look, that look, that look"
1122,01:19:28.58,01:19:28.58,"of ""Oh, I can't... I can't believe this has happened."""
1123,01:19:32.38,01:19:32.38,I want to know why you looked so shocked after you voted the man
1124,01:19:37.08,01:19:37.08,off. >> I was shocked when Dreamz
1125,01:19:39.25,01:19:39.25,didn't give up the immunity idol.
1126,01:19:41.00,01:19:41.00,"And then that put me in a situation, and I voted Yau out."
1127,01:19:44.17,01:19:44.17,"And I just sat there like, ""Wow, Yau is gone."
1128,01:19:46.79,01:19:46.79,"Like, the person that was there with me the whole time, he's"
1129,01:19:49.12,01:19:49.12,"gone."" >> You could have voted off"
1130,01:19:50.33,01:19:50.33,"Cassandra. >> ""We're at that part of the"

1132,01:19:53.12,01:19:53.12,"Cassandra. >> ...the game, but I didn't."
1133,01:19:54.96,01:19:54.96,It was a choice. It was a smart choice.
1134,01:19:58.17,01:19:58.17,>> It's amazing how smart becomes interchanged with lying
1135,01:20:01.12,01:20:01.12,and manipulate. That's it.
1136,01:20:03.83,01:20:03.83,I'm done. All right.
1137,01:20:07.50,01:20:07.50,">> PROBST: Stacy. >> Wow, you guys made it 39"
1138,01:20:16.17,01:20:16.17,days. Congratulations.
1139,01:20:19.21,01:20:19.21,"Earl, the only real difference that I see between you and"
1140,01:20:23.62,01:20:23.62,Dreamz is that you're a little more sophisticated.
1141,01:20:27.83,01:20:27.83,"You're college educated. Once you leave this game, you're"
1142,01:20:31.38,01:20:31.38,going to land on both of your feet.
1143,01:20:34.25,01:20:34.25,"Dreamz, this could change your life, you know?"
1144,01:20:37.21,01:20:37.21,"Earl, I want to know whether I should base my vote on a need"
1145,01:20:42.96,01:20:42.96,basis or not. You know what I'm saying?
1146,01:20:44.79,01:20:44.79,>> We wouldn't even be playing this game if we didn't all need
1147,01:20:46.38,01:20:46.38,"a million dollars. I mean, a million dollars would"
1148,01:20:48.54,01:20:48.54,"change his life, Cassandra's life, and my life as well."
1149,01:20:51.46,01:20:51.46,"I mean, I'm not supposed to feel bad because I have a job."
1150,01:20:54.96,01:20:54.96,I'm not supposed to feel bad because I had a car.
1151,01:20:57.17,01:20:57.17,"I had a tough upbringing, and I worked hard."
1152,01:20:59.58,01:20:59.58,I was raised by a single mom. There was drugs in my family.
1153,01:21:02.17,01:21:02.17,There was violence. There was everything.
1154,01:21:04.04,01:21:04.04,And that's why I feel like it shouldn't be based on need.
1155,01:21:06.75,01:21:06.75,It's just how you played the game.
1156,01:21:08.08,01:21:08.08,And we all need it. We all need it.
1157,01:21:10.96,01:21:10.96,Does that answer your question? >> Yes.
1158,01:21:13.79,01:21:13.79,">> PROBST: Thanks, Stacy. Rocky."
1159,01:21:21.46,01:21:21.46,">> All right, boys and girls, this is how it's going to work--"
1160,01:21:24.12,01:21:24.12,"one question, everybody's going to answer it."
1161,01:21:26.71,01:21:26.71,"How did you manipulate the best? Because everyone here did it,"
1162,01:21:29.25,01:21:29.25,did it a little bit better. I know some of you are familiar
1163,01:21:31.12,01:21:31.12,"with my vocabulary. The word ""kicker"" is going to"
1164,01:21:33.42,01:21:33.42,"come into play today. Kicker is a, you know, clutch"
1165,01:21:35.58,01:21:35.58,player and/or best player. You answer the question for me:
1166,01:21:38.88,01:21:38.88,I am the biggest kicker because of...
1167,01:21:42.17,01:21:42.17,"And then we go like that, and on and on we go."
1168,01:21:44.17,01:21:44.17,"Cassandra, we don't really know each other that well."
1169,01:21:46.08,01:21:46.08,"You're going to go first. And then, after you'll done,"
1170,01:21:48.00,01:21:48.00,I'll pick somebody else. >> I'm the biggest kicker
1171,01:21:50.17,01:21:50.17,because I feel that I listened to a person at a time when they
1172,01:21:53.54,01:21:53.54,"really needed someone to listen to, someone that they could get"
1173,01:21:56.25,01:21:56.25,some positive feedback. >> I don't really want to know
1174,01:21:58.96,01:21:58.96,"about the positive things you did, the nurturing, the burping,"
1175,01:22:02.12,01:22:02.12,nothing like that. I'm going to give you one more
1176,01:22:03.83,01:22:03.83,"chance. If you can't do it, I'm going to"
1177,01:22:05.00,01:22:05.00,"go with somebody else, and then we'll go from there."
1178,01:22:06.62,01:22:06.62,"So second shot. >> You know, honestly, Rocky, I"
1179,01:22:09.71,01:22:09.71,don't feel that I've manipulated a person in this game.
1180,01:22:13.00,01:22:13.00,">> All right, Dreamz, so same question."
1181,01:22:15.04,01:22:15.04,>> I'm the biggest kicker because I manipulated my way to
1182,01:22:18.42,01:22:18.42,the top. Every time I was on the chopping
1183,01:22:20.12,01:22:20.12,"block, I was able to turn it around and put somebody else on"
1184,01:22:22.71,01:22:22.71,there by laying low for little while.
1185,01:22:24.92,01:22:24.92,"I think I manipulated Yau, you know..."
1186,01:22:27.12,01:22:27.12,">> Obviously. >> ...into keeping me around,"
1187,01:22:29.21,01:22:29.21,because I was on the chopping block.
1188,01:22:31.50,01:22:31.50,"You know, so I had to manipulate Yau to get his protection."
1189,01:22:33.79,01:22:33.79,You understand? >> That was an answer.
1190,01:22:36.17,01:22:36.17,"You see? But that was... I mean, that"
1191,01:22:38.54,01:22:38.54,"was... I like that. My man, Earl."
1192,01:22:40.46,01:22:40.46,>> I have to be one of the biggest kickers because I think
1193,01:22:42.12,01:22:42.12,"I manipulated probably everybody up there, because no one thought"
1194,01:22:44.50,01:22:44.50,I was even playing the game. >> That's a decent answer too.
1195,01:22:48.12,01:22:48.12,"I'm done. Nice move, brother."
1196,01:22:50.33,01:22:50.33,"All right, good luck. >> PROBST: Boo, you're up."
1197,01:22:55.75,01:22:55.75,">> Wipe the smiles off your face, boys and girls."
1198,01:22:59.33,01:22:59.33,"First of all, I want to tip my hat off to this man, Yau."
1199,01:23:03.58,01:23:03.58,"I think, by far, he was the greatest all-around player."
1200,01:23:08.38,01:23:08.38,He relied on this man's word. Dreamz didn't come through.
1201,01:23:13.21,01:23:13.21,"You can't make a promise in your heart and then say, ""Oh, well, I"
1202,01:23:17.71,01:23:17.71,"change it now."" >> It wasn't in my heart,"
1203,01:23:19.17,01:23:19.17,"brother. >> Dreamz, I'm speaking."
1204,01:23:20.67,01:23:20.67,You will have another chance to refute what I said.
1205,01:23:22.67,01:23:22.67,">> Go ahead, go ahead. >> When you made that deal with"
1206,01:23:24.79,01:23:24.79,"Yau, were you playing him as a game, or did you, as a"
1207,01:23:27.71,01:23:27.71,Christian-- and I'm coming to you as this because I believe in
1208,01:23:30.79,01:23:30.79,you as a Christian; I want to know your Christian answer.
1209,01:23:34.04,01:23:34.04,"Were you playing him when you accepted that truck, or did you"
1210,01:23:36.29,01:23:36.29,"come back later and say, ""You know what?-- I got to play the"
1211,01:23:40.12,01:23:40.12,"game now; this is my chance""? >> I came here to play the game."
1212,01:23:43.12,01:23:43.12,"I started getting these friends, all these new friends, which"
1213,01:23:45.12,01:23:45.12,really flustered my mind. I was just happy to be around
1214,01:23:47.00,01:23:47.00,people. So it took my mind off the game
1215,01:23:49.12,01:23:49.12,plan. I wasn't even strategizing.
1216,01:23:51.04,01:23:51.04,I was just following people's strategy.
1217,01:23:52.54,01:23:52.54,>> Were you playing the game? >> I was playing the game.
1218,01:23:54.38,01:23:54.38,">> As a Christian man, I want your Christian word."
1219,01:23:55.71,01:23:55.71,>> I was playing the game as a person.
1220,01:23:57.17,01:23:57.17,">> When you accepted his truck deal, were you making that as"
1221,01:23:59.38,01:23:59.38,"the game, or were you making that because you wanted the"
1222,01:24:01.62,01:24:01.62,truck? >> You don't know.
1223,01:24:04.79,01:24:04.79,You don't know what's on the inside.
1224,01:24:06.12,01:24:06.12,I was playing the game. And either it was going to be me
1225,01:24:08.25,01:24:08.25,"or him, and I thought about it right here, sitting in this"
1226,01:24:10.58,01:24:10.58,chair. What would everybody else do?
1227,01:24:13.17,01:24:13.17,Would everybody else give their chance up for a million dollars?
1228,01:24:17.17,01:24:17.17,">> Okay, Dreamz, my opinion, it was a good try, but I see"
1229,01:24:20.83,01:24:20.83,"straight through it. And I still believe in you, but"
1230,01:24:23.79,01:24:23.79,I still believe you're an immature Christian.
1231,01:24:26.38,01:24:26.38,And I hope that one day you will be a strong Christian man and be
1232,01:24:30.00,01:24:30.00,"able to tell the devil, ""Dangle all the money you want in front"
1233,01:24:33.42,01:24:33.42,"of me; this Christian is not for sale."""
1234,01:24:36.08,01:24:36.08,"I just want to say, one more time, congratulations to each"
1235,01:24:39.75,01:24:39.75,and every one of you. >> PROBST: Yau-Man.
1236,01:24:51.58,01:24:51.58,">> First of all, a personal statement."
1237,01:24:53.88,01:24:53.88,"Being a 54-year-old man, I have the advantage of not having"
1238,01:24:58.38,01:24:58.38,"testosterone overload and, therefore, testosterone poison"
1239,01:25:01.29,01:25:01.29,the brains. I can admit to a mistake.
1240,01:25:05.79,01:25:05.79,"Dreamz, what went down yesterday was entirely my fault."
1241,01:25:10.08,01:25:10.08,The truck was given to you in good faith.
1242,01:25:13.33,01:25:13.33,Enjoy it. Do not feel guilty about having
1243,01:25:15.04,01:25:15.04,"it. >> Thank you, Yau-Man."
1244,01:25:18.38,01:25:18.38,>> So now I'm going to give you a chance to have the gonads to
1245,01:25:22.83,01:25:22.83,stand up and say why you changed your mind.
1246,01:25:28.38,01:25:28.38,">> Yau-Man, I didn't change my mind."
1247,01:25:30.83,01:25:30.83,"I didn't change my mind. I was playing the game, Yau-Man."
1248,01:25:33.33,01:25:33.33,"And you can say it yourself, I played a heck of a game."
1249,01:25:35.75,01:25:35.75,"It's outplay, outwit, outlast, and I think I did that."
1250,01:25:38.42,01:25:38.42,"Yau-Man, you just... I'm sorry that you was victim."
1251,01:25:41.17,01:25:41.17,">> And so when you accepted the truck, you were basically"
1252,01:25:44.04,01:25:44.04,"playing me at that time. >> But still, Yau-Man..."
1253,01:25:46.62,01:25:46.62,>> And when you shook my hand... >> You remember the whole thing
1254,01:25:48.21,01:25:48.21,was a game. You was the hardest player of
1255,01:25:50.21,01:25:50.21,"the game, so you should have never forgot that we were"
1256,01:25:52.92,01:25:52.92,playing a game-- never forgot that.
1257,01:25:55.33,01:25:55.33,>> Understood. So you are not going to admit
1258,01:25:58.08,01:25:58.08,"you changed your mind. >> Yau-Man, I would admit it if"
1259,01:26:00.42,01:26:00.42,"I would have changed my mind, but I came here knowing what I"
1260,01:26:02.83,01:26:02.83,was going to do. >> Thank you.
1261,01:26:05.00,01:26:05.00,"Thank you. >> So, Earl, a simple question:"
1262,01:26:09.58,01:26:09.58,why would you not want to take me to the next level?
1263,01:26:14.92,01:26:14.92,">> The reason why I would not want to go against you, because"
1264,01:26:17.08,01:26:17.08,I would not win. >> Thank you.
1265,01:26:19.75,01:26:19.75,>> Because you played the best game by far.

1267,01:26:27.50,01:26:27.50,"Been a lot said, a lot for you guys to take in."
1268,01:26:31.25,01:26:31.25,"Earl, Cassandra, Dreamz, good luck."
1269,01:26:34.38,01:26:34.38,"Jury, I'm going to give you a minute to think about everything"
1270,01:26:37.17,01:26:37.17,"that's been said tonight, and then we will get to the final"
1271,01:26:39.67,01:26:39.67,"vote. >> PROBST: Okay, jury, tonight"
1272,01:27:02.67,01:27:02.67,you are voting for a winner. You are writing down the name of
1273,01:27:06.08,01:27:06.08,the person you feel most deserving of the title of sole
1274,01:27:08.54,01:27:08.54,survivor and the million-dollar check that goes with it.
1275,01:27:13.08,01:27:13.08,"For the last time, it is time to vote."
1276,01:27:15.42,01:27:15.42,"Rocky, you're up. I'll go get the votes."
1277,01:28:39.17,01:28:39.17,Congratulations to all of you for going as far as you did in
1278,01:28:41.58,01:28:41.58,the game. I know the three of you would
1279,01:28:44.08,01:28:44.08,like me to end the suspense right now and read the votes--
1280,01:28:47.54,01:28:47.54,not going to happen. I'll take the votes with me back
1281,01:28:50.96,01:28:50.96,to the States. We will reveal them there.
1282,01:28:53.79,01:28:53.79,See you there. ( cheering and applause )
1283,01:30:01.21,01:30:01.21,Hello! ( cheering and applause )
1284,01:30:08.67,01:30:08.67,All right! ( cheering and applause )
1285,01:30:14.21,01:30:14.21,Let's get to the vote! Plant it.
