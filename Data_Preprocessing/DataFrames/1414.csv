131,00:06:11.67,00:06:11.67,the rest to become the solesurvivor.
132,00:06:23.58,00:06:23.58,( theme song playing )>> Yeah.
133,00:07:41.62,00:07:41.62,"Tribal council was brutaltonight, lots of talk concerning"
134,00:07:45.46,00:07:45.46,my truck giveaway and how thatput a big target on my back.
135,00:07:50.75,00:07:50.75,"So I ended up using my hiddenimmunity idol, which was a good"
136,00:07:54.96,00:07:54.96,"thing, because otherwise Iwouldn't have been here."
137,00:07:59.08,00:07:59.08,">> You did what you weresupposed to do, and you played"
138,00:08:01.25,00:08:01.25,"the idol.I mean, it could have been just"
139,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,to flush the idol out.>> Yeah.
140,00:08:04.42,00:08:04.42,>> Because they know that youhave it.
141,00:08:05.83,00:08:05.83,They're still not certainwhether I have it or not.
142,00:08:08.08,00:08:08.08,>> Right.Keep it that way.
143,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,>> I always get suspicious whenpeople don't tell me what
144,00:08:12.04,00:08:12.04,they're doing.>> Right.
145,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,>> That's the dead giveaway.When you don't tell me
146,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,"anything....>> They might try to target me,"
147,00:08:25.92,00:08:25.92,because now they know that Idon't trust them.
148,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,"Obviously, it's time for me toprotect myself."
149,00:08:30.38,00:08:30.38,"It's all about cannibalism now,trying to eat each other up."
150,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,>> Two more days to go.Here's one for you.
151,00:09:03.04,00:09:03.04,">> Day 37 and five of us left,and because of my deal with"
152,00:09:08.08,00:09:08.08,"Dreamz, I am probably thebiggest target."
153,00:09:11.46,00:09:11.46,"Because if they vote me outbefore final four, then Dreamz"
154,00:09:15.25,00:09:15.25,will not have to renege on hispublic agreement with me.
155,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,So what I need to do at thisimmunity challenge is to win.
156,00:09:40.67,00:09:40.67,">> We're thinking that you'restanding with Yau, and now"
157,00:09:42.58,00:09:42.58,"you're telling us that, youknow, you would have been down"
158,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,with whatever.>> That's where everybody's
159,00:09:47.08,00:09:47.08,messing up.I've always said certain people
160,00:09:50.21,00:09:50.21,in the top five.I never changed that.
161,00:09:52.25,00:09:52.25,And we weren't at the top five.So I wasn't going to write down
162,00:09:55.21,00:09:55.21,"Yau's name, because that's goingagainst my word on what I gave"
163,00:09:59.08,00:09:59.08,Yau.And totally expected it.
164,00:10:01.92,00:10:01.92,That's why I said I wouldn'thave told him.
165,00:10:03.33,00:10:03.33,I said it would have been to Yauto defend himself.
166,00:10:07.17,00:10:07.17,">> Unfortunately, it does becomea time in the game where you do"
167,00:10:09.67,00:10:09.67,have to look at your ownpersonal interests and cut your
168,00:10:12.12,00:10:12.12,friends out.And I don't see any way that
169,00:10:14.46,00:10:14.46,Earl is going to vote Yau orYau's going to vote Earl.
170,00:10:17.08,00:10:17.08,"So Dreamz, Boo, and myself,we're going to have to bond"
171,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17,together while we have thenumbers to level the playing
172,00:10:23.21,00:10:23.21,field.>> So whenever people try to be
173,00:10:26.08,00:10:26.08,slick...>> But does he have it?
174,00:10:28.25,00:10:28.25,You said you'd be real with us.>> All right.
175,00:10:38.12,00:10:38.12,">> He has three clues.I mean, you know, he could have"
176,00:10:39.92,00:10:39.92,found it pretty quickly.>> If Earl has the hidden
177,00:10:54.17,00:10:54.17,"immunity idol and Yau-Man winsthe immunity today, we're in"
178,00:10:57.12,00:10:57.12,"trouble.Definitely Dreamz, myself, or"
179,00:11:01.79,00:11:01.79,"Boo will be going home.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

185,00:11:38.58,00:11:38.58,"make your way through a massive,five-section maze, and you will"
186,00:11:42.17,00:11:42.17,be doing so blindfolded.Here's how it works.
187,00:11:46.54,00:11:46.54,Each of you will be wearing auniquely shaped medallion.

305,00:20:34.96,00:20:34.96,I think me and you together havea much better chance than one of

308,00:20:43.50,00:20:43.50,>> That's what I'm saying.>> So my plea to Earl was to
309,00:20:46.08,00:20:46.08,vote out Dreamz.Take me to the final three with
310,00:20:50.54,00:20:50.54,"you, Yau, and myself.I said you're guaranteed second"
311,00:20:55.08,00:20:55.08,when you go with Yau.You have an option to win a

313,00:21:03.25,00:21:03.25,"That's my plea.And either way you decide, I'll"
314,00:21:07.00,00:21:07.00,respect it.>> I'll definitely give it some
315,00:21:09.88,00:21:09.88,thought.>> It's a decent option for
316,00:21:12.29,00:21:12.29,Earl.It's a great option for me.
317,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,"If he takes it, he takes it, andI live to play another day."
318,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,>> I'm always puzzled at thispoint.
319,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,Boo proposed to vote out Dreamz.That would just be the smart
320,00:21:34.17,00:21:34.17,thing for me to do.Everybody would want to go
321,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,"against Boo.You know, I'd rather go against"
322,00:21:39.04,00:21:39.04,Boo or Cassandra than go againstDreamz or Yau-Man.
323,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,"Dreamz gets the sympathy vote,and Yau-Man gets the underdog"
324,00:21:45.25,00:21:45.25,vote.It's not about who I like and
325,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,who I got alliances with.It's who can I beat in the final

328,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,>> Uh-huh.>> You believe that you think
329,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,it's wise to bring Dreamz to thelast challenge?
330,00:22:05.62,00:22:05.62,"Dreamz has a chance of winning achallenge, and he's definitely"
331,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17,got a chance at winning a vote.>> Sympathy vote.
332,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,>> Huh?>> Sympathy vote.
333,00:22:15.96,00:22:15.96,">> Oh, yeah.I think you'll win against"
334,00:22:18.04,00:22:18.04,everybody else but Dreamz.That's been my thought the whole
335,00:22:19.96,00:22:19.96,way.So if you wanted to make a deal
336,00:22:23.25,00:22:23.25,"with me, I would definitely takesecond place over fifth place."
337,00:22:28.38,00:22:28.38,You'll win a vote against me.>> Boo's plan does sound
338,00:22:32.83,00:22:32.83,enticing.I'm thinking through it.
339,00:22:35.71,00:22:35.71,"But to change from him toDreamz, I need one more vote."
340,00:22:42.50,00:22:42.50,">> So we're good, man.Good job today, man, getting"
341,00:22:45.00,00:22:45.00,that immunity.>> Yeah.

806,01:00:24.38,01:00:24.38,decision.He decided not to give Yau the
807,01:00:28.21,01:00:28.21,immunity idol.He decided to go back on his

811,01:00:37.17,01:00:37.17,"it, I'd be on the jury rightnow, with no chance at all of"
812,01:00:40.08,01:00:40.08,"winning a million dollars.>> When it all went down, I"
813,01:00:42.96,01:00:42.96,"actually was pissed.You know, in the back of my"
814,01:00:45.12,01:00:45.12,"mind, I said, ""Man, I can'tbelieve I'm actually writing"
815,01:00:47.21,01:00:47.21,"down Yau-Man's name, who'strusted me, and I've trusted him"
816,01:00:49.25,01:00:49.25,"through this whole game.""So that was pretty difficult."
817,01:00:53.21,01:00:53.21,"Yau-Man, him and I have beenthrough a lot, and I would hope"
818,01:00:55.79,01:00:55.79,"that, you know, on that jury Istill have his vote, that he"
819,01:00:58.67,01:00:58.67,"won't hold it against me, and heknows I was just playing the"

821,01:01:04.12,01:01:04.12,the bloody end.The decision tonight that I made
822,01:01:08.50,01:01:08.50,with Yau is not going to beweighing on my mind.
823,01:01:10.79,01:01:10.79,I have no regrets.I think I did everything the
824,01:01:12.46,01:01:12.46,"right way, like I was supposedto."
825,01:01:14.21,01:01:14.21,"I planned it out step by step,and I have no regrets."
826,01:01:17.08,01:01:17.08,I think everything worked outperfect.
827,01:01:26.12,01:01:26.12,"Like I said, I take it back tothe old concept of it's a game,"
828,01:01:29.08,01:01:29.08,and everybody else lied andcheated and slithered their way
829,01:01:32.29,01:01:32.29,"through the game, biting eachother, snakes, rats, weasels."
830,01:01:35.75,01:01:35.75,So it's not going to play on mymind.
831,01:01:38.08,01:01:38.08,"I'm just going to sleepcomfortable tonight, knowing"
832,01:01:39.83,01:01:39.83,that I got a shot at a milliondollars tomorrow.
833,01:02:02.17,01:02:02.17,">> Day 39, last day, and we'reall still here."

835,01:02:10.08,01:02:10.08,">> Ecstatic, that's our word.>> Ecstatic."
836,01:02:12.21,01:02:12.21,>> So I'm putting the smileyface on now.
837,01:02:14.38,01:02:14.38,"We figure by 39, we deserve abig smile."
838,01:02:18.79,01:02:18.79,We have spent 39 full days inthe same underwear.
839,01:02:23.58,01:02:23.58,>> The same funk.>> In the same funk.
840,01:02:25.50,01:02:25.50,"I discarded my underwear,though, about three weeks ago."
841,01:02:29.67,01:02:29.67,">> This is the last day on thisisland, game over, and I'm"
842,01:02:36.42,01:02:36.42,happy.The plan for today is to relish
843,01:02:47.83,01:02:47.83,"in the moment, and we'recelebrating just by being happy."
844,01:02:51.46,01:02:51.46,"You know, we don't have a lot ofenergy to do cartwheels and"
845,01:02:54.04,01:02:54.04,jumping jacks and run around theisland.
846,01:02:57.12,01:02:57.12,We just don't have the energyfor that.
847,01:02:58.79,01:02:58.79,"But occasionally we look at eachother and just nod like, ""We did"
848,01:03:02.96,01:03:02.96,"it."">> Food!"
849,01:03:05.25,01:03:05.25,">> No, it's not.>> A mirage!"

1043,01:15:58.08,01:15:58.08,"to like her, comforting her andnurturing her to use her vote to"
1044,01:16:02.08,01:16:02.08,then quickly discard her whenshe was no longer of any use to

1126,01:19:44.17,01:19:44.17,"And I just sat there like, ""Wow,Yau is gone."
1127,01:19:46.79,01:19:46.79,"Like, the person that was therewith me the whole time, he's"

1139,01:20:23.62,01:20:23.62,Dreamz is that you're a littlemore sophisticated.
1140,01:20:27.83,01:20:27.83,"You're college educated.Once you leave this game, you're"
1141,01:20:31.38,01:20:31.38,going to land on both of yourfeet.

1143,01:20:37.21,01:20:37.21,"Earl, I want to know whether Ishould base my vote on a need"
1144,01:20:42.96,01:20:42.96,basis or not.You know what I'm saying?
1145,01:20:44.79,01:20:44.79,>> We wouldn't even be playingthis game if we didn't all need
1146,01:20:46.38,01:20:46.38,"a million dollars.I mean, a million dollars would"
1147,01:20:48.54,01:20:48.54,"change his life, Cassandra'slife, and my life as well."
1148,01:20:51.46,01:20:51.46,"I mean, I'm not supposed to feelbad because I have a job."
1149,01:20:54.96,01:20:54.96,I'm not supposed to feel badbecause I had a car.
1150,01:20:57.17,01:20:57.17,"I had a tough upbringing, and Iworked hard."
1151,01:20:59.58,01:20:59.58,I was raised by a single mom.There was drugs in my family.
1152,01:21:02.17,01:21:02.17,There was violence.There was everything.
1153,01:21:04.04,01:21:04.04,And that's why I feel like itshouldn't be based on need.
1154,01:21:06.75,01:21:06.75,It's just how you played thegame.
1155,01:21:08.08,01:21:08.08,And we all need it.We all need it.
1156,01:21:10.96,01:21:10.96,Does that answer your question?>> Yes.

1161,01:21:29.25,01:21:29.25,did it a little bit better.I know some of you are familiar
1162,01:21:31.12,01:21:31.12,"with my vocabulary.The word ""kicker"" is going to"
1163,01:21:33.42,01:21:33.42,"come into play today.Kicker is a, you know, clutch"

1165,01:21:38.88,01:21:38.88,I am the biggest kicker becauseof...
1166,01:21:42.17,01:21:42.17,"And then we go like that, and onand on we go."
1167,01:21:44.17,01:21:44.17,"Cassandra, we don't really knoweach other that well."
1168,01:21:46.08,01:21:46.08,"You're going to go first.And then, after you'll done,"
1169,01:21:48.00,01:21:48.00,I'll pick somebody else.>> I'm the biggest kicker
1170,01:21:50.17,01:21:50.17,because I feel that I listenedto a person at a time when they
1171,01:21:53.54,01:21:53.54,"really needed someone to listento, someone that they could get"
1172,01:21:56.25,01:21:56.25,some positive feedback.>> I don't really want to know

1174,01:22:02.12,01:22:02.12,nothing like that.I'm going to give you one more

1176,01:22:05.00,01:22:05.00,"go with somebody else, and thenwe'll go from there."
1177,01:22:06.62,01:22:06.62,"So second shot.>> You know, honestly, Rocky, I"
1178,01:22:09.71,01:22:09.71,don't feel that I've manipulateda person in this game.
1179,01:22:13.00,01:22:13.00,">> All right, Dreamz, so samequestion."
1180,01:22:15.04,01:22:15.04,>> I'm the biggest kickerbecause I manipulated my way to

1199,01:23:08.38,01:23:08.38,He relied on this man's word.Dreamz didn't come through.
