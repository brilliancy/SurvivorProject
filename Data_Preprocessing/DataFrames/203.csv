99,00:06:29.37,00:06:29.37,"And if we have to choose oneperson, well, it makes no sense"
100,00:06:31.37,00:06:31.37,"not to choose, uh, Colby.He's the strongest, my God."
101,00:06:34.53,00:06:34.53,"You're the strongest.>> COLBY: Yeah, I saw you throw"

249,00:15:58.70,00:15:58.70,didn't go up at all.All he did was basically play
250,00:16:02.23,00:16:02.23,the role of instructor on how tocook fish.

373,00:22:39.57,00:22:39.57,stuff.So it's natural for Colby just
374,00:22:41.97,00:22:41.97,to gravitate and a little smokescreen goes up and so he doesn't
375,00:22:44.63,00:22:44.63,necessarily see certain things.Or maybe he does and I'm just

418,00:24:56.70,00:24:56.70,because he doesn't want to doanything else.

546,00:34:15.97,00:34:15.97,towards Maralyn.We've had a lot of physical
547,00:34:19.17,00:34:19.17,"challenges up till now, but I'msure some of them are going to"
548,00:34:21.33,00:34:21.33,"be mental, and I think Maralyncould prove to be an asset."
549,00:34:23.70,00:34:23.70,"Why should we lose her?For what, 'cause she fell a few"
550,00:34:26.47,00:34:26.47,"times, 'cause she's older?Why?"
551,00:34:28.73,00:34:28.73,What kind of team is that?She works her ass off.
552,00:34:31.07,00:34:31.07,"She's the first one up everymorning-- you, me and her."
553,00:34:34.47,00:34:34.47,"Mitchell does all right, but hestruggles."
554,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,He doesn't do a lot of work.When was the last time you've
555,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,seen him go up the hill and getwood?
556,00:34:40.67,00:34:40.67,Never.Mitchell's the weakest of our
557,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,strength of getting a lot ofheavy work done.
558,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,"When it comes to the challenges,Maralyn, I think, is stronger"
559,00:34:49.70,00:34:49.70,than he is in the challenges.All we need is just the four of
560,00:34:50.77,00:34:50.77,us.No pressure.
561,00:34:53.70,00:34:53.70,">> TINA: Thanks, Keith.>> KEITH: I could be cutting my"
562,00:34:56.40,00:34:56.40,"own throat doing this.At least with Colby, we can"
563,00:34:58.27,00:34:58.27,"discuss it, probably disagreeupon it and it'll stay with us."
564,00:35:03.47,00:35:03.47,>> COLBY: Keith's wanting to putyou on the chopping block
565,00:35:05.57,00:35:05.57,tonight.And he's got Maralyn with him
566,00:35:08.90,00:35:08.90,and he came to me and Tina.Strategies are starting to
567,00:35:12.07,00:35:12.07,"develop more and go in differentdirections, and the more we"
568,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,"learn about each other, the moreyou start to second-guess what"
569,00:35:17.97,00:35:17.97,you've done.>> MITCHELL: Keith is trying to
570,00:35:20.77,00:35:20.77,pull around a swing vote to tryto get me out.
571,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,Why would we want to kick offour fun Maralyn and then keep
572,00:35:27.63,00:35:27.63,the pessimist and the back-stabber?
573,00:35:31.03,00:35:31.03,">> KEITH: You guys ready?>> COLBY: At this point,"
574,00:35:32.90,00:35:32.90,Keith and Mitchell and Maralynare neck-and-neck for tribal
575,00:35:36.87,00:35:36.87,council tonight.>> JEFF: So let's talk about the
576,00:35:58.07,00:35:58.07,fact that you guys have beenhere... nine days?
577,00:36:01.47,00:36:01.47,>> MARALYN: Yes.>> JEFF: You're in the honeymoon
578,00:36:03.73,00:36:03.73,stage.It hasn't even begun yet.
579,00:36:07.07,00:36:07.07,So I just want to talk about acouple of big topics: trust.
580,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,"Colby, is there anybody herethat you don't trust, that you"
581,00:36:12.80,00:36:12.80,wouldn't trust?>> COLBY: Sure. Sure.
582,00:36:14.53,00:36:14.53,">> JEFF: Tell me about that.>> COLBY: Well, I think that's"
583,00:36:17.10,00:36:17.10,part of the game.It's way too early to tell
584,00:36:21.67,00:36:21.67,"exactly who you can trust, Ithink."
585,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,">> JEFF: What about you,Mitchell?"
586,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,You trust everybody here for 42days?
587,00:36:30.57,00:36:30.57,">> MITCHELL: Well, I think themotto is ""trust no one."""
588,00:36:33.47,00:36:33.47,"I have a lot of faith in a goodnumber of these people, but I"
589,00:36:37.37,00:36:37.37,"couldn't give 100% of my trust.>> JEFF: What about you, Mad"
590,00:36:40.27,00:36:40.27,Dog?Are these all your buddies?
591,00:36:43.27,00:36:43.27,">> MARALYN: Yes.Yes, and Jeff, I trust with my"
592,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,"heart.>> JEFF: Jerri, who here would"
593,00:36:52.80,00:36:52.80,"you say you're closest to,so far?"
594,00:36:55.30,00:36:55.30,>> JERRI: Um... I've been veryfortunate in my ability to bond
595,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,"with Amber and Mitchell andColby, in particular."
596,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,"I think friendship does enterinto it at some point, but it's"
597,00:37:10.23,00:37:10.23,very important to keep thatseparate from the game.
598,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,"It's two totally differentthings, and that's where it gets"
599,00:37:15.30,00:37:15.30,"tricky.>> JEFF: Keith, who have you"
600,00:37:17.87,00:37:17.87,bonded with?>> KEITH: Several individuals.
601,00:37:21.37,00:37:21.37,"You know, and I guess I equatethe bonding different than"
602,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,friendship.I think it's more of a
603,00:37:24.97,00:37:24.97,camaraderie for me than it isactual friendship.
604,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,">> MARALYN: Jeff, I'm conjoinedwith Tina."
605,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,>> JEFF: Really?>> MARALYN: Yes.
606,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,( Jerri laughs )>> MARALYN: She is a
607,00:37:35.03,00:37:35.03,constellation.And... the cowboy.
608,00:37:39.67,00:37:39.67,"Yeah.Oh, the poor cowboy has dragged"
609,00:37:43.57,00:37:43.57,me around so many times.>> COLBY: I'd do it again.
610,00:37:49.73,00:37:49.73,">> MARALYN: I appreciate it,Cowboy."
611,00:37:50.80,00:37:50.80,"You hear that, he'd do it again?>> COLBY: I'd do it again."
612,00:37:53.47,00:37:53.47,">> JEFF: Colby, are you sad atall tonight?"
613,00:37:56.40,00:37:56.40,">> COLBY: Yeah, yeah, I am.Because any way the vote goes on"
614,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"this, the seven of us are reallytight, so the inevitable is"
615,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,"here.We're broken up after tonight,"
616,00:38:08.00,00:38:08.00,and that's tough.No matter which way it goes.
617,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,">> JEFF: It's time to vote.Mad Dog, you're up first."
618,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,">> KEITH: Mitchell, it justseems like you're tired."
619,00:39:08.83,00:39:08.83,>> JERRI: This is probably oneof the most difficult things for
620,00:39:11.60,00:39:11.60,me to do right now.It's purely strategic.
621,00:39:14.67,00:39:14.67,It's nothing personal.I am going to miss you dearly.
622,00:39:43.17,00:39:43.17,">> TINA: Mad Dog, I love you, Ivalue your friendship more than"
623,00:39:45.87,00:39:45.87,anything.This vote has everything to do
624,00:39:49.17,00:39:49.17,with a promise I made.It has nothing to do with you.
625,00:39:52.93,00:39:52.93,I hope you'll understand.>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
626,00:40:00.90,00:40:00.90,"votes.Once the votes are tallied,"
627,00:40:28.83,00:40:28.83,"the decision is final, and theperson will be asked to leave"
628,00:40:31.20,00:40:31.20,the tribal council areaimmediately.
629,00:40:32.37,00:40:32.37,I'll read the votes.The first vote...
630,00:40:42.47,00:40:42.47,Jerri.Maralyn.
631,00:40:57.37,00:40:57.37,Mitchell.Mad Dog.
632,00:41:15.30,00:41:15.30,"Three votes, Mad Dog.And a very sad Mad Dog."
633,00:41:27.83,00:41:27.83,"You need to bring me your torch,Mad Dog."
634,00:41:44.20,00:41:44.20,"Mad Dog, the tribe has spoken.It's time for you to go."
635,00:41:54.40,00:41:54.40,">> Bye.>> JEFF: Well, I don't think I"
636,00:41:59.97,00:41:59.97,have to ask how you guys arefeeling tonight.
637,00:42:02.23,00:42:02.23,I think the last vote probablysays it all.
638,00:42:04.43,00:42:04.43,"Grab your torches, head backto camp."
639,00:42:30.47,00:42:30.47,"Stay tuned for scenes fromnext time, and Maralyn's"
640,00:42:32.27,00:42:32.27,final words.Next time on Survivor:
641,00:42:37.80,00:42:37.80,Will Keith and Tina wage waragainst Jerri?
642,00:42:40.23,00:42:40.23,>> KEITH: I didn't come out hereto be pushed around by a
643,00:42:42.30,00:42:42.30,bartender wanna-be actress.( raspy laughter )
644,00:42:44.33,00:42:44.33,">> JEFF: And at Kucha, hasMichael's blood lust gone too"

648,00:42:52.97,00:42:52.97,going out full.( wry laughter )
649,00:42:59.93,00:42:59.93,">> MARALYN: I cannot thank youenough for selecting me, and"
650,00:43:03.70,00:43:03.70,this experience has meant somuch to me.
651,00:43:08.43,00:43:08.43,"At 52, I could feel myselfreally coming alive."
652,00:43:13.83,00:43:13.83,"Oh, hell, I'm tired.Did this all really happen?"
653,00:43:17.70,00:43:17.70,Did I... did I do this?
