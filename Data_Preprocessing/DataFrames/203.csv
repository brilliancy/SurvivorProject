5,00:00:11.40,00:00:11.40,>> KIMMI: Mike thanks God for making him the leader of the
6,00:00:12.83,00:00:12.83,tribe. I don't know when he was
7,00:00:14.87,00:00:14.87,"anointed, but apparently my back was turned."

11,00:00:24.23,00:00:24.23,"food is, uh... we don't really have a good plan, actually."
12,00:00:27.03,00:00:27.03,>> JEFF: And Jerry muscled in on Chef Keith's domain.
13,00:00:29.30,00:00:29.30,>> JERRI: There's a bunch more things we can have than rice and
14,00:00:31.47,00:00:31.47,I'm ready to start making some of them.
15,00:00:33.37,00:00:33.37,>> KEITH: She if she wants to cook some tortillas for
16,00:00:34.87,00:00:34.87,"breakfast, I think that's fantastic."
17,00:00:36.13,00:00:36.13,No worries me. >> JEFF: Rodger struggled with
18,00:00:38.50,00:00:38.50,the reward challenge. >> RODGER: Water is not my
19,00:00:40.40,00:00:40.40,"finest point. >> KIMMI: Come on, Rodger!"

23,00:00:55.07,00:00:55.07,"voted out. >> JEFF: Kel, the tribe has"
24,00:00:57.23,00:00:57.23,spoken. 14 people are left.
25,00:01:00.57,00:01:00.57,"Tonight, one more will go. >> MICHAEL: Ultimately, this"
26,00:02:25.30,00:02:25.30,"game is about the million dollars, but you need to take"
27,00:02:29.17,00:02:29.17,small steps along the way to get there.
28,00:02:32.10,00:02:32.10,And some of the small steps along the way to get there are
29,00:02:35.03,00:02:35.03,"eating, because none of us are going to win the million dollars"
30,00:02:37.50,00:02:37.50,if we don't have protein in our bodies and we can win the
31,00:02:39.20,00:02:39.20,"challenges. You guys, there's more food to"
32,00:02:43.47,00:02:43.47,be had that we haven't explored yet.
33,00:02:46.30,00:02:46.30,We still don't have food as a priority in this camp.
34,00:02:49.57,00:02:49.57,>> RODGER: What's your chances of catching a pig?
35,00:02:51.80,00:02:51.80,">> JEFF V.: Pig hunting, since we haven't seen, like, an"
36,00:02:53.70,00:02:53.70,"abundance of them, you know, there's like one out there."
37,00:02:55.40,00:02:55.40,>> RODGER: Or any. >> JEFF V.: You know what I
38,00:02:56.83,00:02:56.83,mean? We just walk around and hope
39,00:02:58.80,00:02:58.80,that during day we run into this big pig the size of a table.
40,00:03:01.87,00:03:01.87,Mike wants to go out four hours a day and look for food because
41,00:03:03.70,00:03:03.70,Mike is hungry. Nobody else is up for that.
42,00:03:07.80,00:03:07.80,>> MICHAEL: I am going to find something that's alive that we
43,00:03:10.10,00:03:10.10,"are going to kill. I am very, very determined to"
44,00:03:15.17,00:03:15.17,get a pig. They got to drink sometime and
45,00:03:18.30,00:03:18.30,there's got to be tracks somewhere and I'm going to
46,00:03:21.37,00:03:21.37,"ambush one. Hey, Jeff, where's that spear"
47,00:03:25.33,00:03:25.33,you made? >> JEFF V.: I didn't finish it.
48,00:03:28.77,00:03:28.77,"But if you're going to use it for a spear, then..."
49,00:03:34.03,00:03:34.03,">> MICHAEL: Once I see a pig, it's going to be a, you know, an"
50,00:03:36.17,00:03:36.17,incredible act of exertion to try and get.
51,00:03:39.10,00:03:39.10,But I'm going to build a spear with the with the knife on the
52,00:03:41.50,00:03:41.50,"end, and then I'm going to run one down, and I'm going to get"
53,00:03:44.63,00:03:44.63,"as close as I can. And I'm just going to kind of,"
54,00:03:47.00,00:03:47.00,"you know, figure it out from there."
55,00:03:48.53,00:03:48.53,>> ELISABETH: We should be looking for tracks right now.
56,00:03:50.43,00:03:50.43,>> ALICIA: This isn't about running out looking for a hard-
57,00:03:51.87,00:03:51.87,core hunter. This is about doing something
58,00:03:53.30,00:03:53.30,that's realistic. That is not realistic.
59,00:03:55.83,00:03:55.83,">> JEFF V.: Mike, I'm a little worried you're going to lose"
60,00:03:57.13,00:03:57.13,that knife. >> MICHAEL: And I'm glad you
61,00:03:58.87,00:03:58.87,"brought that to my attention, and I will absolutely,"
62,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,positively not lose this knife. >> JEFF V.: I hope he loses our
63,00:04:04.30,00:04:04.30,"knife, just to give a valuable reason to go off on the bastard."
64,00:04:09.63,00:04:09.63,">> ELISABETH: We have one knife, and that one knife, it might as"
65,00:04:13.43,00:04:13.43,"well be food, but he wants to go and spear a pig."
66,00:04:16.20,00:04:16.20,"Really, have we seen a pig? We haven't seen a pig."
67,00:04:19.20,00:04:19.20,"I haven't seen a pig. Believe me, if I see a pig, I'll"
68,00:04:21.13,00:04:21.13,"want to eat it, but to just go spear just because you want to"
69,00:04:23.83,00:04:23.83,"come back with one or your stick and be like ""rah, rah""?"
70,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40,I don't know. >> MICHAEL: This is a pig
71,00:04:29.57,00:04:29.57,killer. >> JEFF V.: The spear.
72,00:04:33.47,00:04:33.47,"The spear, the stupid spear. ""I'm going to go catch pigs."""
73,00:04:38.23,00:04:38.23,And he takes our knife and our rope.
74,00:04:39.90,00:04:39.90,That's classic Mike. He's an idiot.
75,00:04:41.97,00:04:41.97,I want to see your pig. Go get me a pig.
76,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,"( chuckling ) >> TINA: To be honest, I didn't"
77,00:05:05.93,00:05:05.93,expect this adventure to be this hard.
78,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,I find myself just craving food. Doritos.
79,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.
80,00:05:19.47,00:05:19.47,">> COLBY: We haven't had any meat in a week now, and the lack"
81,00:05:21.53,00:05:21.53,"of protein hasn't taken its toll yet, but it's going to."
82,00:05:29.90,00:05:29.90,>> MARALYN: I think I'm going to go check for messages.
83,00:05:32.70,00:05:32.70,"There it is. Oh, late aboriginal fathers, be"
84,00:05:39.93,00:05:39.93,kind to us. I haven't opened it yet.
85,00:05:44.47,00:05:44.47,"""It's time to rise to the top or make a big flop on your"
86,00:05:48.67,00:05:48.67,"shoulders will rest the tribe's fate, for the food you've been"
87,00:05:53.67,00:05:53.67,"wishing, you only get in damn fishing, so try not to get"
88,00:05:58.43,00:05:58.43,"crushed by the wake."" >> JERRI: Sure as hell to be"
89,00:06:03.27,00:06:03.27,"some fishing line. Oh, my God."
90,00:06:06.10,00:06:06.10,I think the main thing that's been keeping us from getting
91,00:06:08.33,00:06:08.33,fish is our fishing line. So this is a huge reward today.
92,00:06:12.57,00:06:12.57,>> AMBER: I'm worried about running out of food and running
93,00:06:14.00,00:06:14.00,out of rice. And we've been trying to eat it
94,00:06:15.80,00:06:15.80,"sparingly, but... >> MARALYN: You got to eat."
95,00:06:18.70,00:06:18.70,>> AMBER: ...it's going to run out sooner or later.
96,00:06:20.33,00:06:20.33,And I would love to catch a fish out there or something.
97,00:06:23.87,00:06:23.87,">> KEITH: It's going to be physical, no matter had you look"
98,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17,at it. But what we're trying to decide
99,00:06:26.87,00:06:26.87,is if it's a group effort or it depends on only one person.
100,00:06:29.37,00:06:29.37,"And if we have to choose one person, well, it makes no sense"
101,00:06:31.37,00:06:31.37,"not to choose, uh, Colby. He's the strongest, my God."
102,00:06:34.53,00:06:34.53,"You're the strongest. >> COLBY: Yeah, I saw you throw"
103,00:06:36.90,00:06:36.90,that one up real quick. >> KEITH: You got 20 years on
104,00:06:39.33,00:06:39.33,me. >> MARALYN: A cowboy can handle
105,00:06:41.30,00:06:41.30,any challenge. >> TINA: He would die before he
106,00:06:44.80,00:06:44.80,would fail us. >> COLBY: I would like to think
107,00:06:47.93,00:06:47.93,"that, win or lose on this deal, my stock wouldn't fluctuate at"
108,00:06:50.10,00:06:50.10,"all. And people can say, ""Colby,"
109,00:06:52.47,00:06:52.47,don't worry about it. We don't want to put any
110,00:06:54.50,00:06:54.50,"pressure on you if you don't. If you don't pull through, it's"
111,00:06:56.07,00:06:56.07,"no big deal."" But internally, I don't think"
112,00:06:58.53,00:06:58.53,"that's the case. >> JEFF: Good morning, guys."
113,00:07:13.20,00:07:13.20,"Today we got a great challenge. Before we get to it, though, I"
114,00:07:16.00,00:07:16.00,"want to show you the reward. It's an outback fishing package,"
115,00:07:20.13,00:07:20.13,"complete with line, hooks, lures and a net."
116,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,You got your nylon. Now that we know what we're
117,00:07:26.47,00:07:26.47,"playing for, here's the challenge."
118,00:07:28.27,00:07:28.27,"It tests your strength, balance and endurance."
119,00:07:31.87,00:07:31.87,The object is for both tribes to get all these buckets of water
120,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,loaded onto the shoulders of the other tribe's strongest member.
121,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,The one who holds the buckets the longest without
122,00:07:41.40,00:07:41.40,falling or quitting wins. Each tribe is going to select
123,00:07:45.70,00:07:45.70,one person to be the water bearer.
124,00:07:48.67,00:07:48.67,It should be your strongest person.
125,00:07:50.87,00:07:50.87,You're also going to have a person who is your loader.
126,00:07:53.70,00:07:53.70,This person's going to be loading the buckets of water
127,00:07:56.00,00:07:56.00,onto the shoulders of your water bearer.
128,00:07:58.07,00:07:58.07,"So when you get out there, Ogakor will take the water from"
129,00:08:00.83,00:08:00.83,"Kucha and vice versa, and you will load it onto your water"
130,00:08:02.97,00:08:02.97,bearer. The rest of the people are going
131,00:08:05.27,00:08:05.27,"to transport the water out there, and you're going to do so"
132,00:08:07.37,00:08:07.37,"with one of the beams across your shoulders, a bucket full of"
133,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,"water on either side, and you'll make your way across the"
134,00:08:13.23,00:08:13.23,"balancing beams. If you fall, you got to start"
135,00:08:15.73,00:08:15.73,over. You want as much water in your
136,00:08:18.37,00:08:18.37,buckets as you can handle because your water is going on
137,00:08:21.20,00:08:21.20,the opposing tribe's water bearer.
138,00:08:26.27,00:08:26.27,"Ogakor, you've chosen Colby to be your water bearer."
139,00:08:30.37,00:08:30.37,"Kucha, you've chosen Michael. Survivors ready?"
140,00:08:33.50,00:08:33.50,Go! >> Ogakor! Ogakor! Ogakor!
141,00:08:37.03,00:08:37.03,">> Go, Kucha! >> RODGER: Hang on, Liz."
142,00:08:53.70,00:08:53.70,Get your balance. ( indistinct conversations )
143,00:08:59.10,00:08:59.10,>> That a girl. No worries.
144,00:09:02.43,00:09:02.43,>> RODGER: Take your time. Do your turn.
145,00:09:06.20,00:09:06.20,"( cheering ) >> All right, Elisabeth."

150,00:09:41.77,00:09:41.77,"Way to go. >> MICHAEL: Keep it going,"

152,00:09:45.00,00:09:45.00,"Good job. >> TINA: That a way, Mad Dog."

157,00:10:09.90,00:10:09.90,>> Don't even think about that one.
158,00:10:12.57,00:10:12.57,>> COLBY: This sucks. This sucks.
159,00:10:17.33,00:10:17.33,">> JEFF: Colby and Michael, you guys now have all the buckets."
160,00:10:20.97,00:10:20.97,That means you're each holding more than 400 pounds of water.
161,00:10:24.40,00:10:24.40,Whoever holds on the longest wins.
162,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,">> Let's go, Mike! ( screams )"
163,00:10:32.03,00:10:32.03,>> ELISABETH: Let them bring it on.

170,00:11:12.20,00:11:12.20,guys took on their shoulders. Michael's pole broke before
171,00:11:15.57,00:11:15.57,anybody quit. That means there's no winner--
172,00:11:18.23,00:11:18.23,so now you guys are going to do a runoff.
173,00:11:20.83,00:11:20.83,We're going to do a five-minute timed race.
174,00:11:24.30,00:11:24.30,The tribe that gets the most buckets on the other tribe's
175,00:11:26.73,00:11:26.73,water bearer's shoulders wins this.

189,00:13:02.10,00:13:02.10,"butt off so to hard to get. I mean, we have done fantastic"
190,00:13:05.00,00:13:05.00,"on a small amount of food. You get food in us, and we're"
191,00:13:08.57,00:13:08.57,going to be unstoppable. >> COLBY: Winning this
192,00:13:12.83,00:13:12.83,competition means a lot more to us than just bringing home a bag
193,00:13:14.83,00:13:14.83,of fishing supplies. These are the days when it comes
194,00:13:18.33,00:13:18.33,"down to morale, and the mental edge going into this."
195,00:13:21.23,00:13:21.23,And we're three and one now. The stats are pretty good for
196,00:13:23.03,00:13:23.03,us. I certainly don't think this
197,00:13:25.43,00:13:25.43,answers everything. We still got to catch the fish.
198,00:13:27.90,00:13:27.90,The fish aren't going to jump into our camp.
199,00:13:37.80,00:13:37.80,">> MITCHELL: At the time, I didn't think that reward"
200,00:13:39.63,00:13:39.63,challenge was very important because something told me there
201,00:13:42.23,00:13:42.23,really wasn't a lot of fish out here.
202,00:13:44.40,00:13:44.40,"And it sucks that they didn't give us the fish, they give us"
203,00:13:47.10,00:13:47.10,the means to catch the fish. >> AMBER: You have one.
204,00:13:54.47,00:13:54.47,"I saw it. >> JERRI: Yes, I did. Whoa!"
205,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67,>> MITCHELL: That is awesome. >> AMBER: I don't know what part
206,00:14:00.67,00:14:00.67,we can touch that he won't slice us.
207,00:14:02.63,00:14:02.63,>> JERRI: Okay. All right. >> AMBER: I'm proud of you.
208,00:14:07.20,00:14:07.20,>> MITCHELL: Good job. >> JERRI: I got it off the hook.
209,00:14:09.27,00:14:09.27,I couldn't stop smiling. Keith said there were no fish.
210,00:14:12.47,00:14:12.47,"He said, ""There's no fish out there."""
211,00:14:14.70,00:14:14.70,Him and Kel both were saying that for days and days.
212,00:14:17.03,00:14:17.03,Holy... They were practically jumping in
213,00:14:20.37,00:14:20.37,"the boat. >> MITCHELL: Chef Keith, you're"
214,00:14:24.00,00:14:24.00,going to be proud of us. >> KEITH: Here we go now.
215,00:14:27.20,00:14:27.20,We need the fish gutted and scaled.
216,00:14:28.73,00:14:28.73,"When they came back with fish, they immediately said, ""Oh,"
217,00:14:31.63,00:14:31.63,"where's the chef?"" The ""chef"" word's never been"
218,00:14:34.07,00:14:34.07,used before. >> MITCHELL: Check that out.
219,00:14:37.17,00:14:37.17,">> KEITH: As a chef, my strategy was could come in here and"
220,00:14:39.03,00:14:39.03,"create just spectacular dinners and meals, and until now, we've"
221,00:14:42.30,00:14:42.30,had zero luck at doing anything from the rivers or from the
222,00:14:45.23,00:14:45.23,"floor, for that matter. >> AMBER: Today is day seven,"
223,00:14:48.53,00:14:48.53,"and we have caught our first fish, so actually, that's not"
224,00:14:50.40,00:14:50.40,"too bad. It did take us a week, but hey,"
225,00:14:52.90,00:14:52.90,it's better than two weeks. >> KEITH: How did I know that
226,00:14:56.73,00:14:56.73,"once the fish is caught, I'd be the guy filleting these?"
227,00:14:59.77,00:14:59.77,>> AMBER: You're doing that really well.
228,00:15:01.43,00:15:01.43,>> COLBY: Especially with a dull knife.
229,00:15:02.73,00:15:02.73,"He's doing exceptionally well. >> MITCHELL: Yeah, really."
230,00:15:04.43,00:15:04.43,">> JERRI: I think right now, everybody's pretty happy that"
231,00:15:06.53,00:15:06.53,Keith is there to cook the fish that we've been catching.
232,00:15:10.10,00:15:10.10,I know sometimes he says things to other people that kind of rub
233,00:15:12.57,00:15:12.57,"them the wrong way, but I'm probably the one who gets"
234,00:15:15.90,00:15:15.90,irritated with him the most. I'm aware of that.
235,00:15:21.20,00:15:21.20,>> KEITH: Here we go. We'll just bread those in the
236,00:15:22.87,00:15:22.87,"flour, crush up the salt a little bit."
237,00:15:24.73,00:15:24.73,Put the salt on it and bread it with the flour.
238,00:15:27.23,00:15:27.23,"We just don't have oil, but it'll be okay."
239,00:15:29.50,00:15:29.50,>> JERRI: I say we don't waste the flour.
240,00:15:32.23,00:15:32.23,>> COLBY: The most tension in the tribe seems to be between
241,00:15:34.10,00:15:34.10,Jerri and Keith. With the cooking and everyone
242,00:15:37.03,00:15:37.03,"responding well to her cooking, ( whistles ) that put them on a"
243,00:15:39.97,00:15:39.97,"level playing field there, and so there's not really a power"
244,00:15:42.63,00:15:42.63,"struggle yet, but it could definitely come to that point."
245,00:15:46.33,00:15:46.33,">> MARALYN: Keith, we're all hovering over you like a bunch"
246,00:15:48.30,00:15:48.30,of greedy sharks. >> KEITH: Like I'm doing a
247,00:15:50.57,00:15:50.57,cooking class. >> COLBY: Even when Keith was
248,00:15:52.63,00:15:52.63,"over filleting the fish, I noticed there were several eyes"
249,00:15:55.63,00:15:55.63,"paying attention, and what that tells me is that his stock"
250,00:15:58.70,00:15:58.70,didn't go up at all. All he did was basically play
251,00:16:02.23,00:16:02.23,the role of instructor on how to cook fish.
252,00:16:05.83,00:16:05.83,">> MITCHELL: Ooh, it looks a little bit like a fish Friday."
253,00:16:08.10,00:16:08.10,">> COLBY: Oh, it smells so good. >> TINA: Yes, it does, indeedy."
254,00:16:11.47,00:16:11.47,>> AMBER: I can't wait to try it.
255,00:16:12.97,00:16:12.97,>> KEITH: Maralyn. >> MITCHELL: After a week of
256,00:16:14.37,00:16:14.37,"rice... >> MARALYN: Oh, wow!"
257,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,"Thank you. Oh, yes. >> COLBY: Keith, I am so"
258,00:16:17.73,00:16:17.73,excited. >> TINA: That's good.
259,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,>> KEITH: You like that? >> TINA: Yeah.
260,00:16:21.87,00:16:21.87,The fish that Keith made was excellent.
261,00:16:23.60,00:16:23.60,That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving.
262,00:16:25.73,00:16:25.73,We were so hungry. >> MITCHELL: Mmm.
263,00:16:28.47,00:16:28.47,"So his first meal wasn't that great, but his first meal of"
264,00:16:31.70,00:16:31.70,"fish was fantastic. >> AMBER: Oh, my God, it is so"
265,00:16:38.60,00:16:38.60,good. >> KEITH: Tonight's dinner was
266,00:16:41.00,00:16:41.00,"definitely a success. >> JERRI: Oh, my God."
267,00:16:44.20,00:16:44.20,">> KEITH: Since cooking the fish, I think my stock's gone up"
268,00:16:46.00,00:16:46.00,a good amount. I think the team has been pretty
269,00:16:48.53,00:16:48.53,excited about what I've been able to do for them.
270,00:16:51.27,00:16:51.27,>> MITCHELL: It is so good. I've never had such a great
271,00:16:53.20,00:16:53.20,meal. But you know what?
272,00:16:55.33,00:16:55.33,"Jerri could do that, I could even do that."
273,00:16:58.00,00:16:58.00,"So having a chef out here isn't as crucial as he may think,"
274,00:17:01.07,00:17:01.07,because we don't have a lot to work with.
275,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,>> KIMMI: I'm usually on top of the water.
276,00:17:24.30,00:17:24.30,"I filled up eight jugs this morning, and now I refilled"
277,00:17:26.53,00:17:26.53,"up... this is the second one, so now I've done ten jugs of water."
278,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,">> ELISABETH: Are you all right, Kimmi?"
279,00:17:33.27,00:17:33.27,>> KIMMI: Yeah. It's a lot of work because
280,00:17:35.50,00:17:35.50,you've got to boil this crocodile creek water before you
281,00:17:37.60,00:17:37.60,can drink it. You got to go down and fill the
282,00:17:41.63,00:17:41.63,"big jug and then go up, boil the water, let the water cool, put"
283,00:17:44.07,00:17:44.07,"it in the big container. I mean, it doesn't seem like"
284,00:17:46.73,00:17:46.73,"you're contributing a lot because it's gone, as soon as"
285,00:17:49.27,00:17:49.27,"it's there, it's gone. I got to go tend to the water."
286,00:17:56.73,00:17:56.73,>> RODGER: I have noticed the amount of work that Kimmi has
287,00:17:58.47,00:17:58.47,been doing. And it seems to be a whole lot
288,00:18:00.33,00:18:00.33,more than really just about anybody else.
289,00:18:03.70,00:18:03.70,She's really worried that she's going to be the next one to go.
290,00:18:07.97,00:18:07.97,>> KIMMI: I sometimes feel vulnerable because I don't have
291,00:18:12.03,00:18:12.03,"a tight, tight bond with somebody that could be pulling"
292,00:18:14.30,00:18:14.30,"for me in my corner. Yeah, that might be a bad thing"
293,00:18:17.30,00:18:17.30,"because I might be just like, ""Oh, easy target, pick Kimmi"
294,00:18:19.20,00:18:19.20,"off."" This means that I boiled"
295,00:18:22.83,00:18:22.83,everything in this jug. >> MICHAEL: Really?
296,00:18:25.23,00:18:25.23,>> ALICIA: Every job and task that Kimmi takes on in this camp
297,00:18:28.63,00:18:28.63,"can be taken over by somebody else, for sure."
298,00:18:31.30,00:18:31.30,">> KIMMI: Kentucky? >> RODGER: Yes, ma'am, what?"
299,00:18:33.10,00:18:33.10,Do you have lotion? You all good?
300,00:18:34.83,00:18:34.83,">> RODGER: Yeah, I just put some on a little while ago, thanks."
301,00:18:37.03,00:18:37.03,">> JEFF V.: Well, there's sort of a little battle between"
302,00:18:39.60,00:18:39.60,Kentucky Joe and Kimmi. Some of the people in the tribe
303,00:18:43.87,00:18:43.87,feel that we will be stronger without Kentucky Joe.
304,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,>> RODGER: I'm going to try to catch some fish this morning.
305,00:18:49.50,00:18:49.50,Make a new line. >> ELISABETH: I know in the
306,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,beginning there was talk of voting Rodger off and I tried
307,00:18:54.97,00:18:54.97,really hard to rally people not to do it just 'cause I feel
308,00:18:57.60,00:18:57.60,"strongly for him. >> ALICIA: Kentucky Joe, though"
309,00:19:03.63,00:19:03.63,he's not a strong member of this tribe as far as challenges are
310,00:19:06.40,00:19:06.40,"concerned, he knows what he's doing outside."
311,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,">> RODGER: If I can draw them, maybe I'll be able to catch one"
312,00:19:10.73,00:19:10.73,this time. I always heard that the best
313,00:19:14.37,00:19:14.37,place to catch them is where a stream runs into a river.
314,00:19:17.80,00:19:17.80,I was out here looking for sinkers to make a new fishing
315,00:19:21.10,00:19:21.10,"pole with, and I found a little rock out here about that tall"
316,00:19:23.23,00:19:23.23,shaped like a heart. >> ELISABETH: He said here you
317,00:19:25.43,00:19:25.43,go. What's that look like?
318,00:19:26.90,00:19:26.90,"And I said, ""a heart."" He said, ""You take that with"
319,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53,"you, give it to your boyfriend when you get back."""
320,00:19:31.33,00:19:31.33,"And he said, ""You just know I care."""
321,00:19:34.37,00:19:34.37,And it just... it just touched me.
322,00:19:36.93,00:19:36.93,Thanks a lot. >> RODGER: You're welcome.
323,00:19:39.30,00:19:39.30,"Me and her, it just seemed like we hit it off right off the bat."
324,00:19:42.27,00:19:42.27,">> ELISABETH: You're so sweet. >> RODGER: Well, thank you."
325,00:19:44.90,00:19:44.90,"You're a sweet little gal, too, I tell you what."
326,00:19:46.80,00:19:46.80,Your parents got a lot to be proud of with you.
327,00:19:49.13,00:19:49.13,">> ALICIA: Elisabeth said she won't vote off Kentucky Joe, and"
328,00:19:52.87,00:19:52.87,she protects him. >> ELISABETH: It matters so much
329,00:19:56.03,00:19:56.03,"to me that he's around, so I'm not writing his name down."
330,00:19:58.83,00:19:58.83,Uh-uh. I will not spell that man's
331,00:20:01.80,00:20:01.80,name. >> MARALYN: \xe2\x99\xaa When I'm on the
332,00:20:07.70,00:20:07.70,street where you live \xe2\x99\xaa I have often walked down this
333,00:20:17.80,00:20:17.80,"street before. \xe2\x99\xaa >> TINA: Hey, you, girly girl."
334,00:20:22.00,00:20:22.00,>> MARALYN: Hello. >> TINA: I just followed your
335,00:20:23.83,00:20:23.83,voice. >> MARALYN: Was it that loud?
336,00:20:26.80,00:20:26.80,">> TINA: Maralyn, she's kind of like our little song bird and"
337,00:20:29.23,00:20:29.23,"our little cheerleader in our camp, so Maralyn and I have"
338,00:20:32.50,00:20:32.50,bonded more so than I have with any of the other people.
339,00:20:36.40,00:20:36.40,"It might be our ages, it might be that we just kind of took up"
340,00:20:40.07,00:20:40.07,for one another. Mad Dog?
341,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,Nothing hurts Mad Dog? >> MARALYN: Tina is a fabulous
342,00:20:47.73,00:20:47.73,woman. She is a star.
343,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,"I trust Tina the most. Um, I do not trust Jerri."
344,00:21:04.63,00:21:04.63,>> COLBY: You like crunchy peanut butter or creamy?
345,00:21:08.10,00:21:08.10,>> JERRI: Crunchy. >> COLBY: Got to have crunchy.
346,00:21:10.40,00:21:10.40,>> JERRI: Yeah. >> COLBY: Black coffee or cream
347,00:21:12.03,00:21:12.03,and sugar? >> JERRI: Cream and sugar.
348,00:21:14.20,00:21:14.20,>> AMBER: There could be something going on between Jerri
349,00:21:15.57,00:21:15.57,"and Colby. I mean from the very first day,"
350,00:21:18.07,00:21:18.07,she told me how cute she thought he was.
351,00:21:19.97,00:21:19.97,And at first she didn't think that he liked her.
352,00:21:22.90,00:21:22.90,"And I was are like, ""Jerri, it's only the second day."""
353,00:21:25.97,00:21:25.97,>> JERRI: I'd really like it if Colby and I got together.
354,00:21:28.07,00:21:28.07,"He's exactly my type, plus, he's a cowboy and I'm such a"
355,00:21:31.13,00:21:31.13,sucker for cowboys. >> COLBY: Cake or ice cream?
356,00:21:34.53,00:21:34.53,">> JERRI: Oh, cake. >> COLBY: Oh... I dig ice cream."
357,00:21:40.73,00:21:40.73,"Oh, Jerri, Jerri and I are getting along great."
358,00:21:44.30,00:21:44.30,Every day we have more fun flirting with each other and
359,00:21:48.20,00:21:48.20,seeing how far we can kind of push it.
360,00:21:50.10,00:21:50.10,Chocolate chip cookie or oatmeal raisin?
361,00:21:53.20,00:21:53.20,>> JERRI: Chocolate chip. >> COLBY: That wasn't really a
362,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90,fair competition. Oatmeal raisin never stood a
363,00:21:58.70,00:21:58.70,"chance in that battle. >> KEITH: Oh, I think Jerri is"
364,00:22:03.60,00:22:03.60,legitimately attracted to Colby. But I'm sure that strategic play
365,00:22:07.53,00:22:07.53,"is involved, there's no question."
366,00:22:17.03,00:22:17.03,>> COLBY: You don't have to give me a massage...
367,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,">> JERRI: That's all right, though."
368,00:22:22.63,00:22:22.63,"I really, I don't mind, especially after today,"
369,00:22:25.57,00:22:25.57,what you did to your back. >> KEITH: I think Jerri's
370,00:22:28.47,00:22:28.47,approach is just a lot of... she wants to really feel important.
371,00:22:31.43,00:22:31.43,"She's already got Colby on her side, but she gets on his side"
372,00:22:34.43,00:22:34.43,"rubbing his back and, you know, nuzzling at night, you know,"
373,00:22:37.83,00:22:37.83,"that whole thing, sharing the blanket, all that kind of"
374,00:22:39.57,00:22:39.57,stuff. So it's natural for Colby just
375,00:22:41.97,00:22:41.97,to gravitate and a little smoke screen goes up and so he doesn't
376,00:22:44.63,00:22:44.63,necessarily see certain things. Or maybe he does and I'm just
377,00:22:46.17,00:22:46.17,"not aware of it. ( Colby moans, Jerri laughs )"
378,00:22:48.37,00:22:48.37,">> COLBY: At this point, I'm not sure if Jerri has ulterior"
379,00:22:50.33,00:22:50.33,motives. Jerri is very capable of
380,00:22:53.77,00:22:53.77,deceiving me or anyone else in the tribe.
381,00:22:56.43,00:22:56.43,"And maybe she's not. Maybe I'm wrong, but, uh, I"
382,00:22:59.27,00:22:59.27,still can't let my guard down. >> JERRI: Relax.
383,00:23:03.77,00:23:03.77,If it came down to me having to vote for Colby.... I would.

387,00:23:32.47,00:23:32.47,went for that foraging walk together intentionally.
388,00:23:34.57,00:23:34.57,"I've thought a lot about the voting, and I wanted to be able"
389,00:23:37.57,00:23:37.57,to get away with her and just have her think about the future
390,00:23:40.53,00:23:40.53,and who would be the most valuable to have with us in a
391,00:23:43.80,00:23:43.80,"final four, that we could beat. You and I committed to each"
392,00:23:49.00,00:23:49.00,"other for that final four. >> ALICIA: Right, because the"
393,00:23:51.77,00:23:51.77,"truth of the matter is, I feel like you're the only one that I"
394,00:23:54.60,00:23:54.60,"really trust, at this point. Wow!"
395,00:23:57.70,00:23:57.70,Look at the size of that one. >> JEFF V.: That is a major
396,00:23:59.13,00:23:59.13,spider. >> ALICIA: Jeff and I are
397,00:24:02.27,00:24:02.27,constantly scheming and planning about how this thing should go.

400,00:24:10.83,00:24:10.83,>> JEFF V.: No. And I don't think Nick can be either.
401,00:24:13.03,00:24:13.03,"We talked about, you know, who we're going to vote for now, who"
402,00:24:15.10,00:24:15.10,"we're going to vote for next time, who we trust, who we don't"
403,00:24:16.50,00:24:16.50,trust. >> ALICIA: Nick flies under the
404,00:24:19.33,00:24:19.33,radar. >> JEFF V.: Nick flies very much
405,00:24:21.97,00:24:21.97,"under the radar, and Nick is a total player."
406,00:24:24.03,00:24:24.03,I don't trust him as far as I can spit.
407,00:24:26.40,00:24:26.40,"I mean, I feel Nick would screw all of us."
408,00:24:29.10,00:24:29.10,Nick is very lazy. Don't let me take the fire with
409,00:24:31.87,00:24:31.87,"me, as I drag this through here. He won't pick up anything, he"
410,00:24:36.27,00:24:36.27,"won't lift anything. If you ask him to help you,"
411,00:24:38.57,00:24:38.57,he'll act like he doesn't hear you.
412,00:24:40.70,00:24:40.70,>> NICK: I'm sorry. I didn't even hear what you
413,00:24:42.43,00:24:42.43,said. >> JEFF V.: That's okay.
414,00:24:44.27,00:24:44.27,>> NICK: I'm zoning out. >> ALICIA: You know what?
415,00:24:46.03,00:24:46.03,He's too secure in his position right now.
416,00:24:48.07,00:24:48.07,">> JEFF V.: Yeah, absolutely. He's done our kitchen, which"
417,00:24:51.53,00:24:51.53,is lovely. And he's built a lovely little
418,00:24:53.87,00:24:53.87,outdoor chair and he's built a lovely little patio but only
419,00:24:56.70,00:24:56.70,because he doesn't want to do anything else.
420,00:25:00.23,00:25:00.23,">> NICK: Mentally, you need to feel like you're comfortable"
421,00:25:02.27,00:25:02.27,where you are. And that's why I built the
422,00:25:04.40,00:25:04.40,"kitchen. You know, the kitchen serves"
423,00:25:06.53,00:25:06.53,"little purpose, but it looks good, it makes you feel"
424,00:25:08.20,00:25:08.20,comfortable. It's noticeable that you're
425,00:25:10.13,00:25:10.13,"doing work, which makes people happy."
426,00:25:11.50,00:25:11.50,">> ELISABETH: Nice! >> NICK: Hey, I made you a"
427,00:25:13.80,00:25:13.80,"recliner, Rodger. >> RODGER: Hey, you get that"
428,00:25:16.07,00:25:16.07,done where I can sleep in it. >> KIMMI: I just don't see the
429,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,necessity in making benches when we need firewood.
430,00:25:21.67,00:25:21.67,"I think that that's not a priority, I think that's is a"
431,00:25:23.77,00:25:23.77,"luxury. >> JEFF V.: Unfortunately, we"
432,00:25:27.23,00:25:27.23,"need him, so, you know, what can we do?"
433,00:25:29.40,00:25:29.40,"He's one of our stronger people, but when we get to a point where"
434,00:25:32.13,00:25:32.13,"somebody in our group has to go, he's going to be the first."
435,00:25:44.63,00:25:44.63,"( thunder rumbling ) >> MITCHELL: When it rains, it's"
436,00:25:56.43,00:25:56.43,"a scary moment. If the fire goes out, everything"
437,00:25:59.43,00:25:59.43,"around us gets wet, and we only have a couple matches."
438,00:26:05.13,00:26:05.13,">> JERRI: It was at the point where it was almost out, and"
439,00:26:07.63,00:26:07.63,there was hardly any light coming off of it.
440,00:26:09.87,00:26:09.87,And no heat at all. >> KEITH: Do you have some of
441,00:26:16.27,00:26:16.27,that grass? It was really raining hard.
442,00:26:19.47,00:26:19.47,We were not going to let the rain win over our fire.
443,00:26:22.97,00:26:22.97,It just wasn't going to happen. >> TINA: I'm tired.
444,00:26:37.50,00:26:37.50,"That was a rough one. Cold, rainy, pretty miserable."
445,00:26:44.73,00:26:44.73,">> MITCHELL: My side of the tent was all wet, so I had to sleep"
446,00:26:48.37,00:26:48.37,"in wet clothes with a wet blanket and sand, and I can't"
447,00:26:52.40,00:26:52.40,recall sleeping even a full hour.
448,00:26:54.47,00:26:54.47,>> MARALYN: Last night was a hard night.
449,00:26:57.60,00:26:57.60,"It poured, I mean not just a little drizzle, it just poured."
450,00:27:03.23,00:27:03.23,">> KEITH: People fight, sometimes, to put the fire out."
451,00:27:05.60,00:27:05.60,We were up all night trying to keep that fire going.
452,00:27:09.20,00:27:09.20,"I think the hardest thing for me, so far, has just been trying"
453,00:27:11.90,00:27:11.90,to catch up enough sleep so the body's ready to go into combat
454,00:27:15.43,00:27:15.43,in our challenges. >> JERRI: Everybody's kind of
455,00:27:23.03,00:27:23.03,getting a little lethargic. The fish definitely helped.
456,00:27:26.60,00:27:26.60,"That was a big morale booster, but ever since, we're kind of on"
457,00:27:29.93,00:27:29.93,a downslide right now and it kind of scares me a little bit.
458,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83,>> MITCHELL: When you think about how low you are on
459,00:27:36.53,00:27:36.53,"nutrition and how hungry you are, being tired just... just"
460,00:27:40.20,00:27:40.20,quadruples it. Getting mail is always an
461,00:27:45.60,00:27:45.60,"exciting thing, but I was so weak walking up that hill to get"
462,00:27:49.33,00:27:49.33,"the mail, it was treacherous for me."

464,00:27:55.23,00:27:55.23,"I may not be able to do, and that was a depressing thought"
465,00:27:57.60,00:27:57.60,for me. We got mail.

479,00:28:31.40,00:28:31.40,>> COLBY: I'm dragging. This is the most tired I've
480,00:28:32.73,00:28:32.73,"been. Personally, I'm a little worried"
481,00:28:34.63,00:28:34.63,about myself. I know I'm not going to be as
482,00:28:38.63,00:28:38.63,strong going into this one as I have been in the past.

485,00:28:55.63,00:28:55.63,Today's challenge is very simple in concept and very tough in
486,00:28:59.97,00:28:59.97,execution. It's an obstacle course.
487,00:29:03.47,00:29:03.47,"You're going to start by racing through a log chute, then"
488,00:29:07.57,00:29:07.57,you'll go down a steep sand slide into the river.
489,00:29:10.37,00:29:10.37,"On the other side, you'll go through a series of obstacles."
490,00:29:13.87,00:29:13.87,"Then, finally, you're going to sprint across the sand to the"
491,00:29:16.70,00:29:16.70,finish line. It's going to require a lot of
492,00:29:19.47,00:29:19.47,"physical endurance, flexibility, and teamwork, because here's the"
493,00:29:24.27,00:29:24.27,twist: you're going to go tethered as a team.
494,00:29:26.37,00:29:26.37,"( laughter, groaning ) >> JEFF V.: Oh, God!"
495,00:29:29.70,00:29:29.70,>> JEFF: You're only as fast as your slowest member.
496,00:29:31.93,00:29:31.93,>> AMBER: Wow! >> JEFF: If somewhere along the
497,00:29:35.10,00:29:35.10,"way, a tribe member can't go any longer, you can carry them."
498,00:29:37.30,00:29:37.30,But they have to finish. The first tribe to get all their
499,00:29:40.07,00:29:40.07,members across the finish line wins immunity.

549,00:34:21.33,00:34:21.33,"be mental, and I think Maralyn could prove to be an asset."
550,00:34:23.70,00:34:23.70,"Why should we lose her? For what, 'cause she fell a few"
551,00:34:26.47,00:34:26.47,"times, 'cause she's older? Why?"
552,00:34:28.73,00:34:28.73,What kind of team is that? She works her ass off.
553,00:34:31.07,00:34:31.07,"She's the first one up every morning-- you, me and her."
554,00:34:34.47,00:34:34.47,"Mitchell does all right, but he struggles."
555,00:34:36.83,00:34:36.83,He doesn't do a lot of work. When was the last time you've
556,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,seen him go up the hill and get wood?
557,00:34:40.67,00:34:40.67,Never. Mitchell's the weakest of our
558,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,strength of getting a lot of heavy work done.
559,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,"When it comes to the challenges, Maralyn, I think, is stronger"
560,00:34:49.70,00:34:49.70,than he is in the challenges. All we need is just the four of
561,00:34:50.77,00:34:50.77,us. No pressure.
562,00:34:53.70,00:34:53.70,">> TINA: Thanks, Keith. >> KEITH: I could be cutting my"
563,00:34:56.40,00:34:56.40,"own throat doing this. At least with Colby, we can"
564,00:34:58.27,00:34:58.27,"discuss it, probably disagree upon it and it'll stay with us."
565,00:35:03.47,00:35:03.47,>> COLBY: Keith's wanting to put you on the chopping block
566,00:35:05.57,00:35:05.57,tonight. And he's got Maralyn with him
567,00:35:08.90,00:35:08.90,and he came to me and Tina. Strategies are starting to
568,00:35:12.07,00:35:12.07,"develop more and go in different directions, and the more we"
569,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,"learn about each other, the more you start to second-guess what"
570,00:35:17.97,00:35:17.97,you've done. >> MITCHELL: Keith is trying to
571,00:35:20.77,00:35:20.77,pull around a swing vote to try to get me out.
572,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,Why would we want to kick off our fun Maralyn and then keep
573,00:35:27.63,00:35:27.63,the pessimist and the back- stabber?
574,00:35:31.03,00:35:31.03,">> KEITH: You guys ready? >> COLBY: At this point,"
575,00:35:32.90,00:35:32.90,Keith and Mitchell and Maralyn are neck-and-neck for tribal
576,00:35:36.87,00:35:36.87,council tonight. >> JEFF: So let's talk about the
577,00:35:58.07,00:35:58.07,fact that you guys have been here... nine days?
578,00:36:01.47,00:36:01.47,>> MARALYN: Yes. >> JEFF: You're in the honeymoon
579,00:36:03.73,00:36:03.73,stage. It hasn't even begun yet.
580,00:36:07.07,00:36:07.07,So I just want to talk about a couple of big topics: trust.
581,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,"Colby, is there anybody here that you don't trust, that you"
582,00:36:12.80,00:36:12.80,wouldn't trust? >> COLBY: Sure. Sure.
583,00:36:14.53,00:36:14.53,">> JEFF: Tell me about that. >> COLBY: Well, I think that's"
584,00:36:17.10,00:36:17.10,part of the game. It's way too early to tell
585,00:36:21.67,00:36:21.67,"exactly who you can trust, I think."
586,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,">> JEFF: What about you, Mitchell?"
587,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,You trust everybody here for 42 days?
588,00:36:30.57,00:36:30.57,">> MITCHELL: Well, I think the motto is ""trust no one."""
589,00:36:33.47,00:36:33.47,"I have a lot of faith in a good number of these people, but I"
590,00:36:37.37,00:36:37.37,"couldn't give 100% of my trust. >> JEFF: What about you, Mad"
591,00:36:40.27,00:36:40.27,Dog? Are these all your buddies?
592,00:36:43.27,00:36:43.27,">> MARALYN: Yes. Yes, and Jeff, I trust with my"
593,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,"heart. >> JEFF: Jerri, who here would"
594,00:36:52.80,00:36:52.80,"you say you're closest to, so far?"
595,00:36:55.30,00:36:55.30,>> JERRI: Um... I've been very fortunate in my ability to bond
596,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,"with Amber and Mitchell and Colby, in particular."
597,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,"I think friendship does enter into it at some point, but it's"
598,00:37:10.23,00:37:10.23,very important to keep that separate from the game.
599,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,"It's two totally different things, and that's where it gets"
600,00:37:15.30,00:37:15.30,"tricky. >> JEFF: Keith, who have you"
601,00:37:17.87,00:37:17.87,bonded with? >> KEITH: Several individuals.
602,00:37:21.37,00:37:21.37,"You know, and I guess I equate the bonding different than"
603,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,friendship. I think it's more of a
604,00:37:24.97,00:37:24.97,camaraderie for me than it is actual friendship.
605,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,">> MARALYN: Jeff, I'm conjoined with Tina."
606,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,>> JEFF: Really? >> MARALYN: Yes.
607,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,( Jerri laughs ) >> MARALYN: She is a
608,00:37:35.03,00:37:35.03,constellation. And... the cowboy.
609,00:37:39.67,00:37:39.67,"Yeah. Oh, the poor cowboy has dragged"
610,00:37:43.57,00:37:43.57,me around so many times. >> COLBY: I'd do it again.
611,00:37:49.73,00:37:49.73,">> MARALYN: I appreciate it, Cowboy."
612,00:37:50.80,00:37:50.80,"You hear that, he'd do it again? >> COLBY: I'd do it again."
613,00:37:53.47,00:37:53.47,">> JEFF: Colby, are you sad at all tonight?"
614,00:37:56.40,00:37:56.40,">> COLBY: Yeah, yeah, I am. Because any way the vote goes on"
615,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"this, the seven of us are really tight, so the inevitable is"
616,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,"here. We're broken up after tonight,"
617,00:38:08.00,00:38:08.00,and that's tough. No matter which way it goes.
618,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,">> JEFF: It's time to vote. Mad Dog, you're up first."
619,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,">> KEITH: Mitchell, it just seems like you're tired."
620,00:39:08.83,00:39:08.83,>> JERRI: This is probably one of the most difficult things for
621,00:39:11.60,00:39:11.60,me to do right now. It's purely strategic.
622,00:39:14.67,00:39:14.67,It's nothing personal. I am going to miss you dearly.
623,00:39:43.17,00:39:43.17,">> TINA: Mad Dog, I love you, I value your friendship more than"
624,00:39:45.87,00:39:45.87,anything. This vote has everything to do
625,00:39:49.17,00:39:49.17,with a promise I made. It has nothing to do with you.
626,00:39:52.93,00:39:52.93,I hope you'll understand. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the
627,00:40:00.90,00:40:00.90,"votes. Once the votes are tallied,"
628,00:40:28.83,00:40:28.83,"the decision is final, and the person will be asked to leave"
629,00:40:31.20,00:40:31.20,the tribal council area immediately.
630,00:40:32.37,00:40:32.37,I'll read the votes. The first vote...
631,00:40:42.47,00:40:42.47,Jerri. Maralyn.
632,00:40:57.37,00:40:57.37,Mitchell. Mad Dog.
633,00:41:15.30,00:41:15.30,"Three votes, Mad Dog. And a very sad Mad Dog."
634,00:41:27.83,00:41:27.83,"You need to bring me your torch, Mad Dog."
635,00:41:44.20,00:41:44.20,"Mad Dog, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
636,00:41:54.40,00:41:54.40,">> Bye. >> JEFF: Well, I don't think I"
637,00:41:59.97,00:41:59.97,have to ask how you guys are feeling tonight.
638,00:42:02.23,00:42:02.23,I think the last vote probably says it all.
639,00:42:04.43,00:42:04.43,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
640,00:42:30.47,00:42:30.47,"Stay tuned for scenes from next time, and Maralyn's"
641,00:42:32.27,00:42:32.27,final words. Next time on Survivor:
642,00:42:37.80,00:42:37.80,Will Keith and Tina wage war against Jerri?
643,00:42:40.23,00:42:40.23,>> KEITH: I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a
644,00:42:42.30,00:42:42.30,bartender wanna-be actress. ( raspy laughter )
645,00:42:44.33,00:42:44.33,">> JEFF: And at Kucha, has Michael's blood lust gone too"
646,00:42:46.67,00:42:46.67,"far? >> KIMMI: Oh, my God, oh, my"
647,00:42:49.30,00:42:49.30,"God, oh, my God... >> ALICIA: We've reached a new"
648,00:42:50.80,00:42:50.80,"level. >> MICHAEL: If I go out, I'm"
649,00:42:52.97,00:42:52.97,going out full. ( wry laughter )
650,00:42:59.93,00:42:59.93,">> MARALYN: I cannot thank you enough for selecting me, and"
651,00:43:03.70,00:43:03.70,this experience has meant so much to me.
652,00:43:08.43,00:43:08.43,"At 52, I could feel myself really coming alive."
653,00:43:13.83,00:43:13.83,"Oh, hell, I'm tired. Did this all really happen?"
654,00:43:17.70,00:43:17.70,Did I... did I do this?
