261,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,"WHEN, IN FACT, WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR HIM."
262,00:17:04.43,00:17:04.43,NOTHING TO DO IT'S KIND OF NICE TO GET AWAY AND I FELT LIKE I
263,00:17:08.90,00:17:08.90,WAS A LITTLE KID SNEAKING OUT FROM MY PARENTS' HOUSE AGAIN
264,00:17:12.20,00:17:12.20,WHEN EDDIE AND I WENT TO THE LAGOON AND EDDIE'S REALLY HOT
265,00:17:16.30,00:17:16.30,"SO, LIKE, MAYBE WE'RE DATING, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ISLAND"

285,00:18:14.40,00:18:14.40,WHAT'S TROUBLING TO ME IS I DON'T THINK ANDREA WANTS TO VOTE
286,00:18:16.70,00:18:16.70,ME OUT. I THINK SHE WANTS TO KEEP ME
287,00:18:18.87,00:18:18.87,HERE. I THINK SHE LIKES ME AND I THINK
288,00:18:20.80,00:18:20.80,SHE REALLY DOES WANT TO DRAG ME ALONG IN THIS GAME AND I JUST
289,00:18:23.43,00:18:23.43,NEED TO BE DRAGGED TWO OR THREE MORE VOTES BEFORE I CAN GET UP
290,00:18:26.17,00:18:26.17,ON MY OWN FEET AND START PUNCHING PEOPLE.

296,00:18:41.03,00:18:41.03,CAN WORK VOTE TO VOTE AND I CAN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SNEAK
297,00:18:44.40,00:18:44.40,YOU BY. I'D VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE IN

393,00:26:40.33,00:26:40.33,GONE. THEY'RE EASY PICKINGS FOR VOTES
394,00:26:41.77,00:26:41.77,RIGHT NOW. THE FAVORITES HAVE TO THINK I'M
395,00:26:43.90,00:26:43.90,100% WITH THEM OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE.
396,00:26:46.00,00:26:46.00,SO I'VE SAT ON THE BOTTOM FOR 25 DAYS AND I'M GOING TO MAKE MY

404,00:27:10.77,00:27:10.77,HER PLAN AND HER TRUSTING ME WITH THAT PLAN MEANS SHE DOESN'T
405,00:27:13.93,00:27:13.93,SUSPECT WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT I HAVE UP MY SLEEVE.
406,00:27:16.40,00:27:16.40,>> MALCOLM'S A GOOD LIAR. I'M LYING TO HIM; HE'S LYING TO
407,00:27:20.20,00:27:20.20,ME. JUST THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC OF IT IS
408,00:27:22.37,00:27:22.37,PRETTY HILARIOUS. NOW HE'S TRYING TO PULL DAWN
409,00:27:25.77,00:27:25.77,OVER AND DAWN IS WORKING IT. DAWN IS THE M.V.P. OF THE -- I
410,00:27:29.30,00:27:29.30,DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS DAWN CAME FROM.
411,00:27:30.97,00:27:30.97,AFTER NEW DAWN IS -- SHE'S GOOD AT THIS.
412,00:27:32.83,00:27:32.83,">> OKAY, YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT FILL TRIP?"

415,00:27:39.30,00:27:39.30,>> ANDREA IS THE LEADER OUT HERE.
416,00:27:41.57,00:27:41.57,AS MUCH AS PHILLIP HAS BLUSTER AND AS MUCH AS THESE GUYS ARE
417,00:27:44.23,00:27:44.23,"UPSET WITH HIM, HE'S NOT RUNNING THINGS, HE'S KIND OF A JOKE."
418,00:27:48.07,00:27:48.07,"WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO STIR A POT INSIDE A REBELLION, YOU DON'T"
419,00:27:51.10,00:27:51.10,"KILL THE PRINCE, YOU KILL THE PERSON ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SHOW"
420,00:27:53.60,00:27:53.60,WHICH IS ANDREA. I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME TO THE
421,00:27:56.50,00:27:56.50,END. IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW WE DON'T
422,00:27:58.60,00:27:58.60,HAVE THE CHANCE AND REYNOLD HAS AN IDOL.
423,00:28:00.53,00:28:00.53,>> IF YOU SHOW ME THE IDOL THEN I'LL DO IT.
424,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THE EYE AGAIN.
425,00:28:06.60,00:28:06.60,>> I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU TONIGHT.
426,00:28:08.67,00:28:08.67,">> OKAY, OKAY. IT'S NUT IT IS FACT THAT I'M"
427,00:28:10.87,00:28:10.87,COMING BACK AFTER CORRINE'S VOTE AND MALCOLM IS STILL TRUSTING ME
428,00:28:14.10,00:28:14.10,WHEN I'M THE PERSON THAT GAVE THE INFORMATION ON CORRINE TELLS
429,00:28:16.90,00:28:16.90,ME THAT HE'S NOT DIALED IN. >> WE'RE GOOD.
430,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,>> AND THEN DO WE KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING SPLIT THE VOTE?
431,00:28:27.87,00:28:27.87,>> THEY'RE DEFINITELY SPLITTING THE VOTE.
432,00:28:29.83,00:28:29.83,>> BETWEEN WHO? >> YOU AND EDDIE.
433,00:28:32.20,00:28:32.20,"DOESN'T MATTER, THOUGH, THEY HAVE FOUR ME AND DAWN WITH WITH"
434,00:28:37.27,00:28:37.27,"YOU, DONE, NO IDOL HAS TO BE PLAYED SHE JUST WANTS TO KNOW"
435,00:28:39.93,00:28:39.93,THAT WE HAVE IT BECAUSE THE NEXT VOTE WILL BE HARRY.
436,00:28:41.87,00:28:41.87,>> WHO ARE WE VOTING? >> ANDREA.
437,00:28:44.40,00:28:44.40,>> YES! ANDREA.

440,00:29:04.83,00:29:04.83,I JUST HAVE LESS ABILITY TO MOVE OVER.
441,00:29:07.23,00:29:07.23,">> YEAH. >> OH, MY GOSH, I'M SO BEAT."
442,00:29:12.80,00:29:12.80,"ALL RIGHT, COOL. YOU'RE AMAZING."
443,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,>> IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH I GO HOME TONIGHT.
444,00:29:27.87,00:29:27.87,SO DON'T SCREW ME. >> I KNOW THAT.
445,00:29:29.27,00:29:29.27,>> IF I HAVE REASON TO DOUBT YOU I'M GOING TO PLAY IT FOR MYSELF
446,00:29:32.47,00:29:32.47,TONIGHT. >> RIGHT.
447,00:29:33.40,00:29:33.40,"NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT. I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE THAT"
448,00:29:41.37,00:29:41.37,INTIMIDATE OTHER PEOPLE AND I THINK REYNOLD IS USED TO BEING
449,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,IN CONTROL AND GETTING WHAT HE WANT BUT HE DID SHOW ME THE
450,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,"IDOL, WHICH IS HUGE. I MEAN NOW I HAVE MORE"
451,00:29:50.50,00:29:50.50,INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO VOTE AND WHAT TO DO.
452,00:29:52.90,00:29:52.90,"BUT, I MEAN, HE LOOKED OVER AND SAID ""IF YOU BURN ME YOU'LL HAVE"
453,00:29:56.57,00:29:56.57,"HELL TO PAY."" AND I FEEL LIKE SHAME ON YOU,"
454,00:29:59.03,00:29:59.03,SHOULD HAVEN'T SHOWN ME YOUR IDOL.

468,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,DOWN WITH THE GUYS TO THE END. >> ALL RIGHT.
469,00:30:48.67,00:30:48.67,>> IS THAT HAPPENING? >> MAYBE.
470,00:30:50.20,00:30:50.20,>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SPLITTING FOR
471,00:30:52.80,00:30:52.80,ME AND REYNOLD ONE OF US IS GOING HOME.
472,00:30:55.07,00:30:55.07,>> I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT YOU AND REYNOLD.
473,00:30:57.63,00:30:57.63,>> WHY? >> BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING WITH

477,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,>> MAYBE. >> IF YOU TELL ME I'LL VOTE THAT
478,00:31:09.73,00:31:09.73,WAY AND I PROMISE YOU I WON'T MAKE A MOVE.
479,00:31:11.47,00:31:11.47,>> 100% I CAN'T. 100% YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
480,00:31:14.97,00:31:14.97,>> CAN YOU TELL ME IT'S MIKE OR MALCOLM?
481,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,>> IT'S NOT MALCOLM. >> IT IS REYNOLD?
482,00:31:19.33,00:31:19.33,>> DO YOU WANT TO BE SAFE OR NOT?
483,00:31:21.27,00:31:21.27,>> I WANT TO BE SAFE BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE REYNOLD.

487,00:31:31.90,00:31:31.90,>> DOES HE HAVE AN IDOL. >> SOMEBODY HERE DOES.
488,00:31:35.37,00:31:35.37,>> YOU SAID YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL.
489,00:31:37.87,00:31:37.87,>> I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. AS OF RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW
490,00:31:39.80,00:31:39.80,ANYMORE. >> WELL IF MALCOLM REALLY IS
491,00:31:42.37,00:31:42.37,"BETRAYING ME AND THINKS HE HAS FIVE OR SIX IT COULD BE ME, I I"
492,00:31:45.93,00:31:45.93,GUESS. >> IT COULD BE YOU.

507,00:32:32.37,00:32:32.37,WILLING TO ABANDON WHAT I THINK WAS THE SMARTEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE
508,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,"IN TAKING OUT MALCOLM TONIGHT. >> I MEAN, THE SAFEST BET EVER"
509,00:32:38.80,00:32:38.80,WOULD BE MICHAEL. >> I STILL LIKE MALCOLM.

511,00:32:43.87,00:32:43.87,>> SHE'S COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE TO GO
512,00:32:47.03,00:32:47.03,FOR THE SAFE VOTE WHICH WOULD BE TO VOTE OUT MICHAEL BECAUSE
513,00:32:50.03,00:32:50.03,"MICHAEL, UNLIKE ANYBODY ELSE, HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN"
514,00:32:52.23,00:32:52.23,IN TRIBAL COUNCIL NOT TO HAVE AN IDOL.

533,00:33:49.73,00:33:49.73,JUST TO PROVE THAT WE WERE SAFE. YOU KNOW?
534,00:33:54.87,00:33:54.87,">> YEAH. I MEAN -- I MEAN, I CAN CHANGE"
535,00:34:02.63,00:34:02.63,IT. IT AS A GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT AT
536,00:34:22.30,00:34:22.30,THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL IT WASN'T A FAN THAT WAS VOTED OUT?
537,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,"IT WAS A FAVORITE? >> YES, I MEAN, I WAS A LITTLE"
538,00:34:28.57,00:34:28.57,"IN SHOCK BUT ALSO I WAS, LIKE, OH, WELL, THIS IS WHAT I HAD"
