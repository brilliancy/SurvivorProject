414,00:25:08.62,00:25:08.62,"I was happy about that.Because I knew at least, okay,"
415,00:25:11.88,00:25:11.88,"at least, we have a tie.And now, we have a fighting"
416,00:25:15.58,00:25:15.58,chance because it's five to fivebecause Shambo is voting Laura.
417,00:25:19.46,00:25:19.46,"There's no if, ands, and butsabout that."

429,00:26:04.62,00:26:04.62,"because we were talking aboutsome stuff, and I said we need"
430,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,to go talk to John.Because he's the number
431,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,cruncher.>> What's up?
432,00:26:10.67,00:26:10.67,">> Keep it simple, just get ridof the Foa Foa."
433,00:26:12.75,00:26:12.75,Wait until the very last minuteso they don't know who it is.
434,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,"We vote Russell.If he has the idol, he plays"
435,00:26:19.38,00:26:19.38,"it, it flushes out-->> Incorrect."
436,00:26:21.62,00:26:21.62,>> Okay.>> The answer is Natalie.
437,00:26:23.79,00:26:23.79,>> Okay.>> And the reason is she's the
438,00:26:26.08,00:26:26.08,least likely to have the idolbecause she didn't look for it.
439,00:26:29.08,00:26:29.08,"The vote is Natalie, times five.>> Perfect."
440,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,>> Find a problem with that.Is that wrong?
441,00:26:32.92,00:26:32.92,">> Five guys?Okay, okay."
442,00:26:34.88,00:26:34.88,>> I know you'd rather not haveNatalie.
443,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,"No, no, no, I like that.>> I'll burn her right now, I"
444,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,"do not care, bro.>> It's continually impressive"
445,00:26:42.00,00:26:42.00,and bordering on annoying howpathetic the analytical skills
446,00:26:48.46,00:26:48.46,"of the Galu tribe are.""Let's telegraph a move to"
447,00:26:52.04,00:26:52.04,"Russell.""You're an idiot."
448,00:26:54.67,00:26:54.67,"""Let's sit back and let's pissoff Shambo."""
449,00:26:56.92,00:26:56.92,"You're an idiot.""Let's sit back and vote off"
450,00:27:00.04,00:27:00.04,"Erik over a 30-second decision.""You're an idiot."
451,00:27:08.46,00:27:08.46,>> Mm-hmm.>> Laura's going home.
452,00:27:10.46,00:27:10.46,">> No, no.>> Yes, because Shambo will"
453,00:27:13.04,00:27:13.04,"vote for Laura.>> I know, but it's a 5-5 tie."
454,00:27:16.25,00:27:16.25,5-5 tie.It may be true--
455,00:27:18.67,00:27:18.67,>> Right.>> But you're saying it as if it
456,00:27:21.00,00:27:21.00,"is a certainty, game over.That is not the case."
457,00:27:23.25,00:27:23.25,>> They're on the fence.Some people are saying John.
458,00:27:25.38,00:27:25.38,">> That's great.>> So if we say John, so keep"
459,00:27:28.29,00:27:28.29,"it with John?>> So that means, like, we need"
460,00:27:30.00,00:27:30.00,"to go talk to Mick or something.>> Oh, that's brilliant."
461,00:27:32.79,00:27:32.79,"I'll say John, and then theythink they have two Galu saying"
462,00:27:34.83,00:27:34.83,John.>> Let's just think about it.
463,00:27:37.12,00:27:37.12,>> But it's an option.It's a good option.
464,00:27:38.75,00:27:38.75,>> It is a good option.Just don't get excited.
465,00:27:40.46,00:27:40.46,John is flighty.So we don't want to do anything
466,00:27:43.62,00:27:43.62,premature.We want to give it some more
467,00:27:45.17,00:27:45.17,thought.>> Absolutely.
468,00:27:46.75,00:27:46.75,>> Because he gets nervous.>> That's fine.
469,00:27:49.29,00:27:49.29,">> All right, cool.>> This is a big move, you guys."
470,00:27:51.25,00:27:51.25,>> We'll make it happen.It'll be beautiful.
471,00:27:54.08,00:27:54.08,">> Just be confident.>> Yeah, be confident."
472,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,Confident.>> Laura's my strongest ally
473,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"here, and I do not want tothrow her under the bus, so the"
474,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,plan is for me to tell Foa Foathat I am voting for John.
475,00:28:11.08,00:28:11.08,"In reality, I would be votingNatalie with my tribe."
476,00:28:16.08,00:28:16.08,So hopefully all goes to planand it'll be four Foa Foa
477,00:28:19.79,00:28:19.79,"members voting John, five Galumembers voting Natalie, and"
478,00:28:24.21,00:28:24.21,"then the one, Shambo, votingLaura."
479,00:28:27.50,00:28:27.50,Listen I think if we get rid ofJohn now.
480,00:28:29.92,00:28:29.92,">> Look I want to-->> Listen, listen, if we do"
481,00:28:31.88,00:28:31.88,"it now, we still have Shamboagainst Laura and then we have"
482,00:28:34.67,00:28:34.67,"even more numbers.>> Look, look, look, look,"
483,00:28:37.08,00:28:37.08,Shambo is not doing no othervote but Laura tonight.
484,00:28:38.96,00:28:38.96,It's going to end up by being atie you don't go Laura.
485,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,And I was with that from thebeginning.
486,00:28:43.08,00:28:43.08,>> I'm not ready to writeLaura's name.
487,00:28:44.92,00:28:44.92,"If I'm switching, this is ahuge move for me, Russell."
488,00:28:46.92,00:28:46.92,"If I'm switching, I'm not goingto vote out, like..."
489,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,I'm going to vote out someone Iwant to vote out.
490,00:28:51.21,00:28:51.21,Do you see that?>> Mm-hmm.
491,00:28:53.04,00:28:53.04,">> John's smart.>> Yeah, I know."
492,00:28:54.75,00:28:54.75,I want to get rid of John.We need to get him out now.
493,00:28:57.38,00:28:57.38,"This is a huge move for me.And the thing is, is that I"
494,00:29:00.00,00:29:00.00,would rather take out John thanLaura.
495,00:29:02.42,00:29:02.42,">> Okay, all right.>> Just because, I mean, in the"
496,00:29:06.92,00:29:06.92,"end, I need to have some sortof security blanket, and I"
497,00:29:09.25,00:29:09.25,don't trust John.Do you see what I'm saying?
498,00:29:10.67,00:29:10.67,">> Yeah, yeah.>> I don't know how much Foa"
499,00:29:12.04,00:29:12.04,"Foa can trust Monica.She seems legit, or Laura has"
500,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,"put, you know, a little snakein the grass to get"
501,00:29:20.04,00:29:20.04,"information, which is almost aslikely."
502,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,">> She makes me a littlenervous, but I like to think"
503,00:29:25.33,00:29:25.33,she's on our side.>> You know what?
504,00:29:27.17,00:29:27.17,"I want to get the okay fromy'all, but I think the only way"
505,00:29:30.21,00:29:30.21,this is going to work is to letJohn know.
506,00:29:32.96,00:29:32.96,>> Let John know what?>> Let him know that they're
507,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,after him.That's the only way this is
508,00:29:38.38,00:29:38.38,"going to work, dude.>> He doesn't trust us."
509,00:29:40.33,00:29:40.33,>> It's going to be a tie.It's going to be a tie.
510,00:29:45.29,00:29:45.29,>> What's the plan?Where's Shambo at today?
511,00:29:56.83,00:29:56.83,">> What's the response?>> It's like, trying to get"
512,00:30:03.79,00:30:03.79,"them to vote for you, Shambo'svoting for Laura, four would"
513,00:30:05.38,00:30:05.38,vote for you.And none of us would go for
514,00:30:07.04,00:30:07.04,"another one.>> Yeah, well, I haven't said"
515,00:30:13.62,00:30:13.62,"anything.Shambo-- honestly, Shambo's"
516,00:30:15.88,00:30:15.88,going to vote for Laura nomatter what.
517,00:30:17.46,00:30:17.46,We've got to think of anotheroption to deter their votes.
518,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,">> Well, I can come up withsomething, but the answer is to"
519,00:30:24.00,00:30:24.00,not get four votes against me.The most recent development
520,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,today is that the new best wayto save Laura is to throw four
521,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,"Foa Foa votes behind John.Uh, no."
522,00:30:37.83,00:30:37.83,It doesn't sound like a goodplan when you're John.
523,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,">> We're just thinking throughideas, how can we shake up the"
524,00:30:45.08,00:30:45.08,"Foas?>> All right, you guys are"
525,00:30:46.46,00:30:46.46,betting my life that Shambovotes for Laura.
526,00:30:48.12,00:30:48.12,We are betting nothing.>> I would.
527,00:30:54.46,00:30:54.46,">> Well, let's bet yours andnot mine, then."
528,00:30:57.04,00:30:57.04,Because I wouldn't.>> Everyone's got your back.
529,00:30:59.04,00:30:59.04,>> I'm not risking my life tosave Laura's.
530,00:31:02.00,00:31:02.00,"Sorry, Laura, not in the cards.Laura picked a fight with"
531,00:31:05.29,00:31:05.29,somebody that I think is aboutto knock her out.
532,00:31:08.17,00:31:08.17,And I'm not going to step inthe way of the punch.
533,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,>> I was born at night but notlast night. Right?
534,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,>> What have you heard?>> I believe that we're trying

536,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,everybody is.I don't believe that.
537,00:31:25.21,00:31:25.21,"We're putting Laura's namedown, and we're going to go to"
538,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,"the tie.>> If there is a tie tonight,"
539,00:31:30.25,00:31:30.25,the rules of  Survivor  statethere is a re-vote.

541,00:31:36.88,00:31:36.88,rocks.One of these rocks will be of
542,00:31:39.75,00:31:39.75,"different color, and thatperson will go home."

557,00:32:21.21,00:32:21.21,situation that I can positionmyself in would be to vote with
