3,00:00:05.17,00:00:05.17,>> PROBST: The old Galu tribe was up eight to four.
4,00:00:07.42,00:00:07.42,">> Right now, the Galu tribe is tight."
5,00:00:09.62,00:00:09.62,"We confirmed, that you know what? Let's stick together."
6,00:00:11.75,00:00:11.75,>> PROBST: And they anticipated that the rest of the old Foa Foa
7,00:00:14.00,00:00:14.00,would go out quickly and easily. >> What you need to know
8,00:00:15.67,00:00:15.67,you know. >> PROBST: But the Foa Foa four
9,00:00:21.08,00:00:21.08,resolved not to go out gently. >> We all hoped to put a big
10,00:00:24.12,00:00:24.12,dent in that arrogance and patronizing attitude they have
11,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,towards us. >> PROBST: First they convinced
12,00:00:28.54,00:00:28.54,the old Galu to vote out one of their own.
13,00:00:30.38,00:00:30.38,">> I don't trust Erik. >> PROBST: When Erik left,"
14,00:00:36.42,00:00:36.42,Galu's numbers dropped down to seven.
15,00:00:38.50,00:00:38.50,"The tribe has spoken. At the next Tribal Council, the"
16,00:00:43.29,00:00:43.29,old Galu was set to take out Russell.
17,00:00:46.75,00:00:46.75,But he shocked them by playing the hidden immunity idol.
18,00:00:49.96,00:00:49.96,">> Keep hope alive. >> PROBST: So Kelly went home,"
19,00:00:52.62,00:00:52.62,leaving Galu with only six members.
20,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,Or so it would seem. But the old Galu doesn't know
21,00:01:03.04,00:01:03.04,"that one of their own, Shambo, is conspiring with Russell to"
22,00:01:06.21,00:01:06.21,get rid of Laura. >> Shambo hates Laura.
23,00:01:09.50,00:01:09.50,She hates her. >> Laura needs to go.
24,00:01:12.50,00:01:12.50,"She's the bane of my existence. >> PROBST: Well, since the"
25,00:01:15.12,00:01:15.12,"merge, there have been two Tribal Councils, two"
26,00:01:17.04,00:01:17.04,"blind sides, two hidden immunity idols played, and once again,"
27,00:01:20.38,00:01:20.38,the Foa Foa foursome have survived the vote.
28,00:01:23.67,00:01:23.67,"One more thing, the hidden immunity idol goes back into"
29,00:01:26.71,00:01:26.71,the game. >> My work is done.
30,00:01:50.75,00:01:50.75,"It's like a painting, like a Picasso, you know?"
31,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,He's a great artist. This is my artwork.
32,00:01:57.04,00:01:57.04,This might be one of my best pieces of work I've ever done.
33,00:02:03.21,00:02:03.21,There's going to be a pretty expensive sale.
34,00:02:06.75,00:02:06.75,"They'll write me a check for $1 million for this work, so I"
35,00:02:09.58,00:02:09.58,can take that... Take that to the bank.
36,00:02:14.12,00:02:14.12,">> If you guys tell Galu I said this-- ""good move!"""
37,00:02:19.79,00:02:19.79,">> Let me tell you something, that was almost as great as my"
38,00:02:23.58,00:02:23.58,kids being born. (laughter)
39,00:02:25.88,00:02:25.88,>> Dude. >> Wow.
40,00:02:29.83,00:02:29.83,">> Yeah, wow. >> I cannot believe that little"
41,00:02:37.21,00:02:37.21,snake... >> Part of the game.
42,00:02:40.12,00:02:40.12,">> Yep. >> Yes, it is."
43,00:02:42.42,00:02:42.42,>> We've still got the numbers. >> It was quite the shock at
44,00:02:47.67,00:02:47.67,Tribal Council tonight when Russell pulled out that second
45,00:02:49.79,00:02:49.79,hidden immunity idol. We know that he's sneaky and
46,00:02:53.54,00:02:53.54,"that he just, like, lurks around camp and he's always"
47,00:02:56.25,00:02:56.25,snooping around. We should have known better.
48,00:02:59.21,00:02:59.21,We really should have known better.
49,00:03:01.58,00:03:01.58,">> Oh, you're in trouble. >> (laughing)"
50,00:03:04.25,00:03:04.25,">> Oh, my God, the look on her face when you"
51,00:03:07.54,00:03:07.54,played that immunity idol. Do you know what she said when
52,00:03:10.54,00:03:10.54,"they said, ""Kelly, bring me your torch."""
53,00:03:13.08,00:03:13.08,"She goes, ""He has ruined everything."""
54,00:03:16.88,00:03:16.88,And it was all I could do to keep a straight face.
55,00:03:19.46,00:03:19.46,>> I ruined everything? What does she think I'm here
56,00:03:22.17,00:03:22.17,"for her, for to bake her cookies and cakes?"
57,00:03:25.29,00:03:25.29,(laughter) >> Nobody out of the 11
58,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,people had a clue what the hell was going on with the exception
59,00:03:32.96,00:03:32.96,"of me and Russ, and when he got up and played that immunity"
60,00:03:36.25,00:03:36.25,"idol, the look on Laura's face-- she was just pissed."
61,00:03:40.17,00:03:40.17,It was awesome. And I was thinking I got to
62,00:03:43.92,00:03:43.92,"find that immunity idol, give it to Russ again."
63,00:04:16.46,00:04:16.46,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> It's a new beginning.
64,00:04:26.38,00:04:26.38,"Jeff said the immunity idol is back in the game, and I'll be"
65,00:04:28.79,00:04:28.79,"here looking for it, and I will find it."
66,00:04:31.96,00:04:31.96,"It will be the third one. It's like, they're like magnets"
67,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17,to me. I'm just drawn to them.
68,00:04:42.50,00:04:42.50,>> Okay. Work.
69,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,>> Laura is the head viper. She is the viper queen of Galu.
70,00:04:57.71,00:04:57.71,She is the snake of the tribe. She is the evil demon.
71,00:05:00.04,00:05:00.04,She's a beast. Laura has been the first one to
72,00:05:03.79,00:05:03.79,go in my mind since day one. >> I want to relax a bit this
73,00:05:07.92,00:05:07.92,"morning. I want to swing by the wall,"
74,00:05:09.54,00:05:09.54,"Sham, and just... >> Yeah."
75,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,I got four Foa Foa. I got me.
76,00:05:13.04,00:05:13.04,We're on an even playing field right now.
77,00:05:15.21,00:05:15.21,I have to have John. He's my number six.
78,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,Hold on a second. Come here.
79,00:05:20.29,00:05:20.29,">> What's up? >> Here's the thing-- you know,"
80,00:05:24.17,00:05:24.17,it's all well and fine that everybody wants to espouse
81,00:05:26.38,00:05:26.38,purple power. There is no purple.
82,00:05:29.04,00:05:29.04,It takes balls to jump into this arena.
83,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,And how far do you want to extend your life?
84,00:05:34.42,00:05:34.42,"The next immunity challenge, just like the last two, Laura's"
85,00:05:38.08,00:05:38.08,"won, and both times, Laura was supposed to go for the majority"
86,00:05:41.42,00:05:41.42,of the tribe. So I want to know that if she
87,00:05:44.12,00:05:44.12,"doesn't win it, will you be the sixth vote to put her out?"
88,00:05:47.46,00:05:47.46,>> I don't have an answer to that question right now.
89,00:05:50.25,00:05:50.25,I don't. I believe I am the only one
90,00:05:52.71,00:05:52.71,from Galu that knows that Shambo has flipped.
91,00:05:55.71,00:05:55.71,Now the question is what are you going to do with it?
92,00:05:58.75,00:05:58.75,>> Will you betray my confidence that I asked you
93,00:06:00.71,00:06:00.71,that question? >> I won't-- I won't-- I will
94,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,look you straight in the eyes and I will not tell anyone
95,00:06:04.67,00:06:04.67,that you asked me that question. Things are on the table with
96,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,Shambo. She thinks she's in good with
97,00:06:08.83,00:06:08.83,"me, and she is. >> Okay. Thanks, Johnny."
98,00:06:11.46,00:06:11.46,">> But, you know what? I've got do what's right for me."
99,00:06:23.54,00:06:23.54,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to"

104,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,Attached to that cradle are four ropes.
105,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,The other four people will pull on the ropes to maneuver the
106,00:06:50.38,00:06:50.38,person in the cradle as they gather 15 flags one at a time

116,00:07:18.96,00:07:18.96,"next hidden immunity idol. Man, if I can find this clue,"
117,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,that-that's it. It's over.

216,00:11:56.08,00:11:56.08,gonna be possible for me to do what I want to do and take
217,00:11:59.50,00:11:59.50,out Laura. >> We won a reward today:
218,00:12:12.08,00:12:12.08,"Natalie, me, Laura, Brett, and Dave."
219,00:12:15.46,00:12:15.46,"Now, we get to fly to another island, eat and take pictures"
220,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,"with a Sprint phone, which is wonderful."

222,00:12:39.04,00:12:39.04,"Gilligan's island or something, huh?"
223,00:12:42.04,00:12:42.04,">> Oh, my word, it's so cool. >> I think that's the island"

240,00:13:51.21,00:13:51.21,I know we're tight. >> Mm-hmm.
241,00:13:53.83,00:13:53.83,>> I know where the votes are right now.
242,00:13:56.71,00:13:56.71,>> Mm-hmm. >> And...
243,00:14:00.12,00:14:00.12,"you know, if we, if we essentially feel like if we get"
244,00:14:04.38,00:14:04.38,"one more on our side, we're willing to offer them a very,"
245,00:14:08.00,00:14:08.00,very good deal. >> I don't know.
246,00:14:11.38,00:14:11.38,Just don't know. You know what I mean?
247,00:14:14.54,00:14:14.54,>> Yeah. >> It's risky.
248,00:14:16.96,00:14:16.96,">> We just need to make a decision, go to challenge, and"
249,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,"go to Tribal Council. >> But, I mean, we need"
250,00:14:22.21,00:14:22.21,"another-- we need one more vote. >> No, we don't."
251,00:14:24.38,00:14:24.38,">> No, we don't. >> Yeah, we do."
252,00:14:26.42,00:14:26.42,>> You're number six. >> It's still gonna be 5-5.
253,00:14:29.04,00:14:29.04,>> We have five besides you. >> Five besides you.
254,00:14:31.29,00:14:31.29,>> You are number six. >> You're six.
255,00:14:32.96,00:14:32.96,>> Which is why we asked. We need six.
256,00:14:35.08,00:14:35.08,>> How sure are you? >> 115%.
257,00:14:36.67,00:14:36.67,>> How do you know they're not just saying it to you?
258,00:14:39.38,00:14:39.38,>> We know. 'Cause let's put it this way--
259,00:14:42.54,00:14:42.54,this person knew about the last Tribal Council.
260,00:14:45.08,00:14:45.08,>> Right. And he or she actually
261,00:14:48.83,00:14:48.83,encouraged things to make that whole thing happen.
262,00:14:52.46,00:14:52.46,>> I'm thinking that one of the other people that they're
263,00:14:55.38,00:14:55.38,talking about is Shambo. Shambo could be the fifth vote
264,00:14:59.17,00:14:59.17,for the Foa Foas. You can't tell me who that is?
265,00:15:02.08,00:15:02.08,">> No, we won't. >> I want John out."
266,00:15:08.75,00:15:08.75,>> We can absolutely do that. >> Great.
267,00:15:14.58,00:15:14.58,">> What a great day, guys. >> This is phenomenal."
268,00:15:18.75,00:15:18.75,"Best reward so far, Dave? >> Best reward so far."
269,00:15:21.62,00:15:21.62,">> Looking through the photos, I seen a note that's telling us"
270,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,"""Go to your memo board,"" and you'll get the clue."

286,00:16:14.33,00:16:14.33,it 'cause I need the immunity idol for myself.
287,00:16:26.96,00:16:26.96,">> Shambo! >> Hi, you guys!"
288,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,Hello! I missed you! It's about that big.
289,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,It's not a round rock. It's square.
290,00:16:43.12,00:16:43.12,It has moss on it. >> Can you show us there?
291,00:16:45.04,00:16:45.04,>> They're moving. >> No.
292,00:16:46.12,00:16:46.12,>> Those guys are already moving.
293,00:16:47.54,00:16:47.54,>> We totally underestimated Russell's capability of finding
294,00:16:49.54,00:16:49.54,the idol. What we need to do is keep that
295,00:16:53.71,00:16:53.71,hidden immunity idol out of Russell's hands.
296,00:17:06.50,00:17:06.50,>> It's time to hunt. >> I guess so.
297,00:17:08.79,00:17:08.79,>> The party's on. >> There you go.
298,00:17:13.54,00:17:13.54,">> You finding for the same thing I'm looking for, Jaison?"
299,00:17:16.29,00:17:16.29,>> I don't know. What are you looking for?
300,00:17:18.54,00:17:18.54,>> You're the one that's lifting up rocks.
301,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,">> Here's a green. >> No, it's too new."
302,00:17:23.00,00:17:23.00,I know that it has to be where that wall is in camp.
303,00:17:26.38,00:17:26.38,"They have a rock in a little hole, square hole."
304,00:17:28.71,00:17:28.71,Looks like the rock in the picture to me.
305,00:17:30.71,00:17:30.71,"Dave's following me around, turning over rocks."
306,00:17:32.08,00:17:32.08,I get nervous at first 'cause I think I see the rock and then
307,00:17:35.46,00:17:35.46,he turns it over and nothing's there.
308,00:17:37.08,00:17:37.08,So I'm figuring if all of this...
309,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17,You think you can run with me? >> We're just gonna put y'all...
310,00:17:43.08,00:17:43.08,"Oh, man! >> Slow down, Russ!"
311,00:17:45.62,00:17:45.62,">> All right. Come on, Dave. >> Slow down, man, slow down!"
312,00:17:49.12,00:17:49.12,"All right. Come on, Dave."
313,00:18:03.79,00:18:03.79,>> I came back to the same location.
314,00:18:05.79,00:18:05.79,I'm looking at the wall. Look down there.
315,00:18:17.21,00:18:17.21,"There it is. Oh, my God."
316,00:18:23.00,00:18:23.00,"Oh, man. This is getting way too easy."
317,00:18:28.88,00:18:28.88,I'm enjoying it. I'm just running around.
318,00:18:30.83,00:18:30.83,"I'm having more fun now than I've ever had, and my butt's"
319,00:18:33.88,00:18:33.88,"probably in the sling more than ever, but not if they think I"
320,00:18:37.17,00:18:37.17,have an idol. I'm gonna be a-okay.
321,00:18:43.62,00:18:43.62,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa I mean...
322,00:19:12.75,00:19:12.75,I don't trust Shambo or John. And Shambo hates you.
323,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,"And she's pissed, Laura. We have to be careful."
324,00:19:20.54,00:19:20.54,They might come after you. >> They'll come after me first.
325,00:19:25.08,00:19:25.08,I think the Foa Foa people are coming after me.
326,00:19:28.00,00:19:28.00,I've had a target on my head from them from day one.
327,00:19:30.83,00:19:30.83,Sham just completely despises me.
328,00:19:34.08,00:19:34.08,"I need to be on the top of my game, and I have to win this"
329,00:19:37.92,00:19:37.92,"challenge. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
330,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
331,00:19:51.33,00:19:51.33,">> Yes, sir. >> Yes, sir."
332,00:19:53.21,00:19:53.21,">> PROBST: First things first, Laura, give it up."
333,00:20:00.75,00:20:00.75,"Once again, immunity back up for grabs."
334,00:20:04.50,00:20:04.50,Today's challenge happens in two parts:
335,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,"first part, you'll have three tiles of the same color"
336,00:20:09.50,00:20:09.50,arranged close together. Your goal? Throw one rock and
337,00:20:13.96,00:20:13.96,attempt to break as many of these tiles as you can.
338,00:20:16.75,00:20:16.75,"For every tile you break, you earn a spear, which you will"
339,00:20:20.38,00:20:20.38,use in the second part of the challenge when you will shoot
340,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,your spears at a target. Person who lands their spear
341,00:20:26.71,00:20:26.71,"closest to the target wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-"
342,00:20:31.88,00:20:31.88,"nine shot at a million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council."
343,00:20:34.88,00:20:34.88,Somebody will be voted out. Make sense?
344,00:20:37.04,00:20:37.04,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
345,00:20:38.04,00:20:38.04,Makes sense. >> PROBST: We draw for spots.
346,00:20:40.08,00:20:40.08,"We'll get started. All right, everybody grab"
347,00:20:43.83,00:20:43.83,"one rock. If you want a shot at immunity,"
348,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,you've got to break a tile. These tiles are arranged
349,00:20:52.42,00:20:52.42,close together. That means you could break
350,00:20:54.62,00:20:54.62,multiple tiles. It also means somebody could
351,00:20:56.92,00:20:56.92,break one of yours. But you've only got one throw.
352,00:21:01.08,00:21:01.08,Here we go. Ready?
353,00:21:04.29,00:21:04.29,Aim... and throw.
354,00:21:09.04,00:21:09.04,>> Son of a gun! >> PROBST: Shambo just misses.
355,00:21:12.08,00:21:12.08,Russell goes low. Jaison's on the board with
356,00:21:17.25,00:21:17.25,one spear. >> Damn.
357,00:21:22.21,00:21:22.21,>> PROBST: Fincher just misses. Monica can't get it there.
358,00:21:29.00,00:21:29.00,>> Damn it! >> PROBST: Dave Ball knocks out
359,00:21:31.21,00:21:31.21,one of Monica's tiles. Monica now has a spear.
360,00:21:34.04,00:21:34.04,">> Enjoy, money. >> Thanks, honey."
361,00:21:37.00,00:21:37.00,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Natalie a little
362,00:21:38.75,00:21:38.75,short. >> Nice.
363,00:21:42.12,00:21:42.12,">> Oh, bummer! >> PROBST: Mick connects with"
364,00:21:44.21,00:21:44.21,one of his tiles. >> Brett breaks two tiles with
365,00:21:48.46,00:21:48.46,"one toss. >> PROBST: Laura, the only"
366,00:21:53.04,00:21:53.04,"person left to throw. You want a shot at immunity,"
367,00:21:56.71,00:21:56.71,this is it. You have to break a tile.
368,00:22:03.96,00:22:03.96,That's it. >> (laughing)
369,00:22:06.42,00:22:06.42,">> PROBST: No shot at immunity for Laura, Russell, Shambo,"
370,00:22:11.17,00:22:11.17,"John, Natalie, and Dave Ball. All right, moving on to the"
371,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,second part of the challenge. Brett has two spears.
372,00:22:21.04,00:22:21.04,"Jaison, Mick, and Monica have one."
373,00:22:23.54,00:22:23.54,"Let's go. Brett, you're up."
374,00:22:25.54,00:22:25.54,">> Sounds good. >> Go, Brett."
375,00:22:27.08,00:22:27.08,">> Go, B. >> PROBST: Brett taking aim of"
376,00:22:32.50,00:22:32.50,"his first shot. >> Come on, baby."

378,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,>> PROBST: Brett is on the board.
379,00:22:41.92,00:22:41.92,">> Good job, Brett! >> PROBST: Brett has the mark"
380,00:22:43.50,00:22:43.50,"to beat. Jaison, you're up."
381,00:22:46.29,00:22:46.29,"To have a shot at immunity, Jaison has to get inside the"
382,00:22:49.62,00:22:49.62,"mark set by Brett, currently in that second ring."
383,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Jaison misses the
384,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,"target completely. Jaison, no shot at immunity."
385,00:23:02.33,00:23:02.33,Monica. Monica here thanks to Dave Ball
386,00:23:05.88,00:23:05.88,who broke one of Monica's tiles. Monica fires.
387,00:23:15.46,00:23:15.46,"Hits the target but too low. Monica, no shot at immunity."
388,00:23:18.96,00:23:18.96,>> Good shot. >> Good job.
389,00:23:20.46,00:23:20.46,">> Good try, Monica. >> PROBST: Mick."
390,00:23:24.38,00:23:24.38,"One spear. That's all it takes, one shot"
391,00:23:28.08,00:23:28.08,could win it. Mick with a great shot.
392,00:23:39.21,00:23:39.21,Puts his spear inside of Brett's.
393,00:23:41.46,00:23:41.46,Mick is the new mark to beat. It comes down to this.
394,00:23:44.75,00:23:44.75,"Brett, one spear left. You know what you have to do."
395,00:23:47.96,00:23:47.96,"Take your shot. >> Take your time, babe."
396,00:23:59.38,00:23:59.38,>> PROBST: Brett hits too low. Mick wins individual immunity.
397,00:24:02.75,00:24:02.75,"(applause) >> Good job, Mick."
398,00:24:05.25,00:24:05.25,">> PROBST: Mick, come on over. Congratulations."
399,00:24:10.04,00:24:10.04,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Mick safe at
400,00:24:13.67,00:24:13.67,"tonight's Tribal Council. For one of you, that will be as"
401,00:24:17.25,00:24:17.25,far as it goes. Grab your stuff.
402,00:24:19.42,00:24:19.42,Head back to camp. I will see you tonight at
403,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,Tribal Council. Congratulations.
404,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,>> Thank you. >> I believe it is the destiny
405,00:24:24.96,00:24:24.96,of Laura to go home. Today is the day of reckoning.
406,00:24:30.17,00:24:30.17,Medusa's head will be lopped off.
407,00:24:49.17,00:24:49.17,>> Does anybody want any of this coconut?
408,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,>> Are you going to open that thing up?
409,00:24:55.21,00:24:55.21,>> I'm going to give it a sh...
410,00:24:56.75,00:24:56.75,>> Isn't that the cotton candy ones?
411,00:24:58.71,00:24:58.71,>> You got a feeling? >> I got a feeling.
412,00:25:02.00,00:25:02.00,>> The plan is and always was for the last nine days is get
413,00:25:04.25,00:25:04.25,rid of Laura. She keeps winning immunity.
414,00:25:05.67,00:25:05.67,"She finally loses, we got to get rid of her."
415,00:25:08.62,00:25:08.62,"I was happy about that. Because I knew at least, okay,"
416,00:25:11.88,00:25:11.88,"at least, we have a tie. And now, we have a fighting"
417,00:25:15.58,00:25:15.58,chance because it's five to five because Shambo is voting Laura.
418,00:25:19.46,00:25:19.46,"There's no if, ands, and buts about that."
419,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,She's voting Laura. >> I'm voting for Laura
420,00:25:24.92,00:25:24.92,"tonight, and I don't care who else is doing what."
421,00:25:28.08,00:25:28.08,>> Mm-hmm. >> I really don't.
422,00:25:30.08,00:25:30.08,But... >> You're not going to
423,00:25:34.46,00:25:34.46,fluctuate or change at all? >> There's no way in God's
424,00:25:37.12,00:25:37.12,green Earth. Had she not won immunity the
425,00:25:39.88,00:25:39.88,"last two times, that's whose name I would have written down."
426,00:25:42.29,00:25:42.29,>> Mm-hmm. >> She's too strong and she's
427,00:25:44.21,00:25:44.21,too manipulative. >> Okay.
428,00:25:47.33,00:25:47.33,>> There is no more Galu. >> Okay.
429,00:26:01.75,00:26:01.75,">> What's up? >> We were going to ask,"
430,00:26:04.62,00:26:04.62,"because we were talking about some stuff, and I said we need"
431,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,to go talk to John. Because he's the number
432,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,cruncher. >> What's up?
433,00:26:10.67,00:26:10.67,">> Keep it simple, just get rid of the Foa Foa."
434,00:26:12.75,00:26:12.75,Wait until the very last minute so they don't know who it is.
435,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,"We vote Russell. If he has the idol, he plays"
436,00:26:19.38,00:26:19.38,"it, it flushes out-- >> Incorrect."
437,00:26:21.62,00:26:21.62,>> Okay. >> The answer is Natalie.
438,00:26:23.79,00:26:23.79,>> Okay. >> And the reason is she's the
439,00:26:26.08,00:26:26.08,least likely to have the idol because she didn't look for it.
440,00:26:29.08,00:26:29.08,"The vote is Natalie, times five. >> Perfect."
441,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,>> Find a problem with that. Is that wrong?
442,00:26:32.92,00:26:32.92,">> Five guys? Okay, okay."
443,00:26:34.88,00:26:34.88,>> I know you'd rather not have Natalie.
444,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,"No, no, no, I like that. >> I'll burn her right now, I"
445,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,"do not care, bro. >> It's continually impressive"
446,00:26:42.00,00:26:42.00,and bordering on annoying how pathetic the analytical skills
447,00:26:48.46,00:26:48.46,"of the Galu tribe are. ""Let's telegraph a move to"
448,00:26:52.04,00:26:52.04,"Russell."" You're an idiot."
449,00:26:54.67,00:26:54.67,"""Let's sit back and let's piss off Shambo."""
450,00:26:56.92,00:26:56.92,"You're an idiot. ""Let's sit back and vote off"
451,00:27:00.04,00:27:00.04,"Erik over a 30-second decision."" You're an idiot."
452,00:27:08.46,00:27:08.46,>> Mm-hmm. >> Laura's going home.
453,00:27:10.46,00:27:10.46,">> No, no. >> Yes, because Shambo will"
454,00:27:13.04,00:27:13.04,"vote for Laura. >> I know, but it's a 5-5 tie."
455,00:27:16.25,00:27:16.25,5-5 tie. It may be true--
456,00:27:18.67,00:27:18.67,>> Right. >> But you're saying it as if it
457,00:27:21.00,00:27:21.00,"is a certainty, game over. That is not the case."
458,00:27:23.25,00:27:23.25,>> They're on the fence. Some people are saying John.
459,00:27:25.38,00:27:25.38,">> That's great. >> So if we say John, so keep"
460,00:27:28.29,00:27:28.29,"it with John? >> So that means, like, we need"
461,00:27:30.00,00:27:30.00,"to go talk to Mick or something. >> Oh, that's brilliant."
462,00:27:32.79,00:27:32.79,"I'll say John, and then they think they have two Galu saying"
463,00:27:34.83,00:27:34.83,John. >> Let's just think about it.
464,00:27:37.12,00:27:37.12,>> But it's an option. It's a good option.
465,00:27:38.75,00:27:38.75,>> It is a good option. Just don't get excited.
466,00:27:40.46,00:27:40.46,John is flighty. So we don't want to do anything
467,00:27:43.62,00:27:43.62,premature. We want to give it some more
468,00:27:45.17,00:27:45.17,thought. >> Absolutely.
469,00:27:46.75,00:27:46.75,>> Because he gets nervous. >> That's fine.
470,00:27:49.29,00:27:49.29,">> All right, cool. >> This is a big move, you guys."
471,00:27:51.25,00:27:51.25,>> We'll make it happen. It'll be beautiful.
472,00:27:54.08,00:27:54.08,">> Just be confident. >> Yeah, be confident."
473,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,Confident. >> Laura's my strongest ally
474,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"here, and I do not want to throw her under the bus, so the"
475,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,plan is for me to tell Foa Foa that I am voting for John.
476,00:28:11.08,00:28:11.08,"In reality, I would be voting Natalie with my tribe."
477,00:28:16.08,00:28:16.08,So hopefully all goes to plan and it'll be four Foa Foa
478,00:28:19.79,00:28:19.79,"members voting John, five Galu members voting Natalie, and"
479,00:28:24.21,00:28:24.21,"then the one, Shambo, voting Laura."
480,00:28:27.50,00:28:27.50,Listen I think if we get rid of John now.
481,00:28:29.92,00:28:29.92,">> Look I want to-- >> Listen, listen, if we do"
482,00:28:31.88,00:28:31.88,"it now, we still have Shambo against Laura and then we have"
483,00:28:34.67,00:28:34.67,"even more numbers. >> Look, look, look, look,"
484,00:28:37.08,00:28:37.08,Shambo is not doing no other vote but Laura tonight.
485,00:28:38.96,00:28:38.96,It's going to end up by being a tie you don't go Laura.
486,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,And I was with that from the beginning.
487,00:28:43.08,00:28:43.08,>> I'm not ready to write Laura's name.
488,00:28:44.92,00:28:44.92,"If I'm switching, this is a huge move for me, Russell."
489,00:28:46.92,00:28:46.92,"If I'm switching, I'm not going to vote out, like..."
490,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,I'm going to vote out someone I want to vote out.
491,00:28:51.21,00:28:51.21,Do you see that? >> Mm-hmm.
492,00:28:53.04,00:28:53.04,">> John's smart. >> Yeah, I know."
493,00:28:54.75,00:28:54.75,I want to get rid of John. We need to get him out now.
494,00:28:57.38,00:28:57.38,"This is a huge move for me. And the thing is, is that I"
495,00:29:00.00,00:29:00.00,would rather take out John than Laura.
496,00:29:02.42,00:29:02.42,">> Okay, all right. >> Just because, I mean, in the"
497,00:29:06.92,00:29:06.92,"end, I need to have some sort of security blanket, and I"
498,00:29:09.25,00:29:09.25,don't trust John. Do you see what I'm saying?
499,00:29:10.67,00:29:10.67,">> Yeah, yeah. >> I don't know how much Foa"
500,00:29:12.04,00:29:12.04,"Foa can trust Monica. She seems legit, or Laura has"
501,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,"put, you know, a little snake in the grass to get"
502,00:29:20.04,00:29:20.04,"information, which is almost as likely."
503,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,">> She makes me a little nervous, but I like to think"
504,00:29:25.33,00:29:25.33,she's on our side. >> You know what?
505,00:29:27.17,00:29:27.17,"I want to get the okay from y'all, but I think the only way"
506,00:29:30.21,00:29:30.21,this is going to work is to let John know.
507,00:29:32.96,00:29:32.96,>> Let John know what? >> Let him know that they're
508,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,after him. That's the only way this is
509,00:29:38.38,00:29:38.38,"going to work, dude. >> He doesn't trust us."
510,00:29:40.33,00:29:40.33,>> It's going to be a tie. It's going to be a tie.
511,00:29:45.29,00:29:45.29,>> What's the plan? Where's Shambo at today?
512,00:29:56.83,00:29:56.83,">> What's the response? >> It's like, trying to get"
513,00:30:03.79,00:30:03.79,"them to vote for you, Shambo's voting for Laura, four would"
514,00:30:05.38,00:30:05.38,vote for you. And none of us would go for
515,00:30:07.04,00:30:07.04,"another one. >> Yeah, well, I haven't said"
516,00:30:13.62,00:30:13.62,"anything. Shambo-- honestly, Shambo's"
517,00:30:15.88,00:30:15.88,going to vote for Laura no matter what.
518,00:30:17.46,00:30:17.46,We've got to think of another option to deter their votes.
519,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,">> Well, I can come up with something, but the answer is to"
520,00:30:24.00,00:30:24.00,not get four votes against me. The most recent development
521,00:30:28.08,00:30:28.08,today is that the new best way to save Laura is to throw four
522,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,"Foa Foa votes behind John. Uh, no."
523,00:30:37.83,00:30:37.83,It doesn't sound like a good plan when you're John.
524,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,">> We're just thinking through ideas, how can we shake up the"
525,00:30:45.08,00:30:45.08,"Foas? >> All right, you guys are"
526,00:30:46.46,00:30:46.46,betting my life that Shambo votes for Laura.
527,00:30:48.12,00:30:48.12,We are betting nothing. >> I would.
528,00:30:54.46,00:30:54.46,">> Well, let's bet yours and not mine, then."
529,00:30:57.04,00:30:57.04,Because I wouldn't. >> Everyone's got your back.
530,00:30:59.04,00:30:59.04,>> I'm not risking my life to save Laura's.
531,00:31:02.00,00:31:02.00,"Sorry, Laura, not in the cards. Laura picked a fight with"
532,00:31:05.29,00:31:05.29,somebody that I think is about to knock her out.
533,00:31:08.17,00:31:08.17,And I'm not going to step in the way of the punch.
534,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,>> I was born at night but not last night. Right?
535,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,>> What have you heard? >> I believe that we're trying
536,00:31:17.96,00:31:17.96,"to be swindled into telling us to put your name down,"
537,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,everybody is. I don't believe that.
538,00:31:25.21,00:31:25.21,"We're putting Laura's name down, and we're going to go to"
539,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,"the tie. >> If there is a tie tonight,"
540,00:31:30.25,00:31:30.25,the rules of  Survivor  state there is a re-vote.
541,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,"If there is a tie again, the remaining members now choose"
542,00:31:36.88,00:31:36.88,rocks. One of these rocks will be of
543,00:31:39.75,00:31:39.75,"different color, and that person will go home."
544,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,">> If it goes to the tie, that's when it has to happen,"
545,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,"the switch. >> If I vote for Laura tonight,"
546,00:31:49.58,00:31:49.58,"after the tie, I wake up on this beach tomorrow."
547,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,>> I done talked to everybody. Everybody's on the same page.
548,00:31:55.62,00:31:55.62,"We said whoever does the switch, that's who we know is"
549,00:31:57.71,00:31:57.71,"on board. If they don't do the switch, we"
550,00:32:00.08,00:32:00.08,pick a rock. >> And-and what's the next vote?
551,00:32:04.21,00:32:04.21,>> The next vote? >> If I'm going to give you
552,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,"Galu before you give me a Foa Foa, the next one needs to be"
553,00:32:08.62,00:32:08.62,Foa Foa. >> Okay.
554,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,>> Deal? >> That's a deal.
555,00:32:11.96,00:32:11.96,>> But Russell is a player. This guy is full of B.S.
556,00:32:15.92,00:32:15.92,And it's clear the guy will do anything to progress in this
557,00:32:17.62,00:32:17.62,game. My first instinct is the best
558,00:32:21.21,00:32:21.21,situation that I can position myself in would be to vote with
559,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,"Galu, have a 5-5 tie, vote with Galu again, have another 5-5"
560,00:32:30.42,00:32:30.42,"tie, and just pray to God that one of the Foa Foa members go."
561,00:32:35.04,00:32:35.04,I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to
562,00:32:37.25,00:32:37.25,do yet. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
563,00:32:53.29,00:32:53.29,the members of our jury. Erik and Kelly voted out at the
564,00:33:00.92,00:33:00.92,"last Tribal Council. John, are you surprised, two"
565,00:33:09.29,00:33:09.29,"Tribal Councils, two Galu sitting over there?"
566,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,>> Absolutely. Both of the two votes so far
567,00:33:15.38,00:33:15.38,were surprises to me. It's all a surprise.
568,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,">> PROBST: Jaison, is it easier in some sense at this point to"
569,00:33:22.46,00:33:22.46,"be the minority because with four, you don't have as many"
570,00:33:25.71,00:33:25.71,many options? You have to stick together.
571,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,">> Sure, you could make that argument."
572,00:33:29.88,00:33:29.88,"And because we're the minority, if people want to use the"
573,00:33:32.58,00:33:32.58,"votes, they can depend on our trustworthiness to go further."
574,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,">> PROBST: John, what is appealing about the Foa Foa"
575,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,foursome? >> They've already said it.
576,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,You can use four votes. It's plain and simple.
577,00:33:43.21,00:33:43.21,">> Yeah, we've said it, but we still trying to find"
578,00:33:46.21,00:33:46.21,"somebody. >> We're trying to figure out,"
579,00:33:48.62,00:33:48.62,"like, at what point somebody says, ""Oh, hey."
580,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,"This is an individual game,"" and take advantage of our votes,"
581,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,and start playing their own game.
582,00:33:58.58,00:33:58.58,">> PROBST: Shambo, is Galu one tight unit still?"
583,00:34:02.58,00:34:02.58,>> Negative. Absolutely not.
584,00:34:05.08,00:34:05.08,"The day that everybody decided to vote Erik off, Galu was"
585,00:34:09.25,00:34:09.25,broken to me. That's my humble opinion.
586,00:34:12.88,00:34:12.88,">> PROBST: Laura, you're still staring at Shambo."
587,00:34:17.67,00:34:17.67,>> I don't know who she's talking about because the Galu
588,00:34:20.29,00:34:20.29,"that I know, that I've been in, I feel is tight."
589,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33,>> PROBST: A group can't be tight if one of the members
590,00:34:28.92,00:34:28.92,isn't. >> I guess it depends on how
591,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,big of a group you're considering.
592,00:34:33.25,00:34:33.25,">> PROBST: Well, here's what I would consider."
593,00:34:35.17,00:34:35.17,"If Shambo's on the fence, their four becomes five, your six"
594,00:34:38.12,00:34:38.12,becomes five-- we got a really interesting night
595,00:34:41.17,00:34:41.17,in store. >> Absolutely.
596,00:34:43.04,00:34:43.04,>> PROBST: Are you okay with it potentially coming down to a
597,00:34:45.25,00:34:45.25,"tie knowing that, if we revote and you're still tied,"
598,00:34:48.67,00:34:48.67,"everybody over here will draw rocks, and the people who are"
599,00:34:51.12,00:34:51.12,tied will be safe? >> I'm absolutely not okay with
600,00:34:53.96,00:34:53.96,taking a chance. But I'm not the only one in
601,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,control of this game. I have these other people
602,00:34:59.83,00:34:59.83,sitting next to me that have decisions to make as well.
603,00:35:03.04,00:35:03.04,">> PROBST: Dave, are you okay with this going to a tie?"
604,00:35:06.12,00:35:06.12,">> If I need to go to the stones, then I'll go."
605,00:35:09.71,00:35:09.71,">> PROBST: After 27 days, you would draw a stone at chance"
606,00:35:13.21,00:35:13.21,and you're prepared to do that? >> You got to be willing to
607,00:35:16.12,00:35:16.12,make big moves in this game in order to win.
608,00:35:19.17,00:35:19.17,I'd say there's nothing bigger than lady luck.
609,00:35:23.79,00:35:23.79,">> PROBST: I always love it when it gets to the vote, but"
610,00:35:27.42,00:35:27.42,tonight I am especially curious how it's gonna go.
611,00:35:30.71,00:35:30.71,"Mick, you have individual immunity."
612,00:35:32.12,00:35:32.12,I can't imagine you're giving it up tonight.
613,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,>> Nope. >> PROBST: Cannot vote for Mick.
614,00:35:36.04,00:35:36.04,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
615,00:35:38.92,00:35:38.92,"Brett, you're up. >> (whispering): Laura, you are"
616,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,"a viper, as in poison. I pray to God you go tonight."
617,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
618,00:36:42.42,00:36:42.42,>> If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you
619,00:36:45.25,00:36:45.25,"want to play it, now would be the time to do so."
620,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,"Okay. Once the votes are read, the"
621,00:36:53.46,00:36:53.46,decision is final. Person voted out will be asked
622,00:36:55.62,00:36:55.62,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
623,00:36:57.38,00:36:57.38,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Laura."
624,00:37:07.04,00:37:07.04,"Natalie. One vote Laura,"

658,00:41:11.21,00:41:11.21,"Well, since the merge, there have been three very surprising"
659,00:41:15.08,00:41:15.08,"Tribal Councils. At this point, I don't know if"
660,00:41:17.67,00:41:17.67,"it's Galu, Foa Foa or Aiga. And I'm guessing you guys"
661,00:41:22.08,00:41:22.08,don't either. Grab your torches.
662,00:41:23.54,00:41:23.54,Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our

666,00:41:51.92,00:41:51.92,>> Shambo is the one leading the charge.
667,00:41:53.96,00:41:53.96,>> Let's just pull the trigger. >> I agree.
668,00:41:56.00,00:41:56.00,>> He's a cancer. We have to dump him now.
669,00:41:58.17,00:41:58.17,">> Sometimes you just have to say, ""Screw it."

673,00:42:08.46,00:42:08.46,>> I believe that I'm sitting here tonight for a couple of
674,00:42:11.08,00:42:11.08,"reasons: one, because Shambo has always had it out for me,"
675,00:42:12.25,00:42:12.25,"and, two, I think that I was a physical threat."
676,00:42:14.38,00:42:14.38,"Clearly, it wasn't a good idea going into the first two"
677,00:42:16.46,00:42:16.46,individual immunity challenges and winning them back to back.
678,00:42:18.21,00:42:18.21,"I'm disappointed, but I hope that Galu sticks together and"
