1,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor:
2,00:00:03.13,00:00:03.13,These gold buffsare for your new tribe.
3,00:00:04.77,00:00:04.77, The game changed once again
4,00:00:06.97,00:00:06.97, when the two tribes finally merged.
5,00:00:10.07,00:00:10.07,"CLAY: Now is when the game is gonna start,"
6,00:00:11.70,00:00:11.70,'cause I'm gonna tell you what.
7,00:00:13.13,00:00:13.13,"Hell, I'm here to wina million dollars."
8,00:00:14.97,00:00:14.97,PROBST: Ted made himself vulnerable when he went off
9,00:00:17.67,00:00:17.67, for some alone time.
10,00:00:19.77,00:00:19.77,Probably just neededto get away.
11,00:00:20.93,00:00:20.93,CLAY: His attitude
12,00:00:22.80,00:00:22.80,-is getting pretty old.-JAKE: From Clay I got a sense
13,00:00:24.90,00:00:24.90, that they're all really tired of Ted; that's probably
14,00:00:27.97,00:00:27.97,who they'd vote offif they had to vote today.
15,00:00:31.93,00:00:31.93,PROBST: The first individual immunity challenge came down
16,00:00:34.93,00:00:34.93, to a race between Clay and Ken.
17,00:00:38.70,00:00:38.70," Clay won,"
18,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53, ensuring that only he was safe from the vote.
19,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97,"CLAY:...look sexy, baby."
20,00:00:44.13,00:00:44.13,I know I look sexy!
21,00:00:46.13,00:00:46.13,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
22,00:00:47.40,00:00:47.40, the former Sook Jais hung all their hopes
23,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83, on Clay's earlier comments and voted for Ted.
24,00:00:53.13,00:00:53.13,That's three votes-- Ted.
25,00:00:54.77,00:00:54.77, But the five ex-Chuay Gahn targeted Ken.
26,00:00:57.00,00:00:57.00,Last vote-- Ken.
27,00:01:01.40,00:01:01.40,The tribe has spoken.
28,00:01:03.57,00:01:03.57, Seven are left.
29,00:01:05.63,00:01:05.63, Who will be voted out tonight?
30,00:02:37.20,00:02:37.20,"TED: It was interestingyesterday, with Tribal Council."
31,00:02:41.23,00:02:41.23,"I didn't expectto get any votes,"
32,00:02:42.43,00:02:42.43,but I got three votes yesterday.
33,00:02:44.87,00:02:44.87," So I immediately know where those three votes came from,"
34,00:02:47.73,00:02:47.73," and they came from the members of Sook Jai,"
35,00:02:50.53,00:02:50.53, and I'm still trying to piece together as to
36,00:02:52.87,00:02:52.87,the exact reason why.
37,00:02:54.50,00:02:54.50,We didn't knowwho to vote for yesterday.
38,00:02:58.47,00:02:58.47,TED: You guys did a great jobin coordinating your vote.
39,00:03:01.77,00:03:01.77,"Well, each one of us asked yourgroup who we should vote for..."
40,00:03:06.07,00:03:06.07,-Mm-hmm.-...and they said Ken or Ted.
41,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,Who told you guys thatyou should vote for Ken or Ted?
42,00:03:14.03,00:03:14.03,I'd rather not say.
43,00:03:15.67,00:03:15.67,Oh.
44,00:03:16.70,00:03:16.70,I guess we should have each just
45,00:03:18.23,00:03:18.23,"voted our heartand not messed with that, but"
46,00:03:21.07,00:03:21.07,"that was our first vote withyour tribe last night, you know,"
47,00:03:23.80,00:03:23.80,"so we were just tryingto feel out what we should do,"
48,00:03:26.73,00:03:26.73,'cause we didn't have a cluewho to vote for.
49,00:03:28.80,00:03:28.80,(mouthing)
50,00:03:30.23,00:03:30.23,Sorry things didn't work outthe way you guys wanted it
51,00:03:32.83,00:03:32.83,"to work out,but you did what you did."
52,00:03:39.30,00:03:39.30," Despite what I just heard,"
53,00:03:41.50,00:03:41.50, I personally don't believe anybody told them to do that.
54,00:03:43.57,00:03:43.57, I think the members
55,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50,"of Sook Jaiare either intimidated by me,"
56,00:03:48.70,00:03:48.70,"feel that I'm a threat,or they just don't like me."
57,00:03:53.07,00:03:53.07,"Yeah, don't worry, Jake."
58,00:03:54.23,00:03:54.23,We'll keep it in between us.
59,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,Okay.
60,00:03:57.13,00:03:57.13,TED: Jake was sitting here lying
61,00:03:58.93,00:03:58.93, in front of me just as much as I was lying to him.
62,00:04:02.57,00:04:02.57," It's just the way the game is played,"
63,00:04:04.77,00:04:04.77,and I have no problemswith that.
64,00:04:08.40,00:04:08.40, Jake the snake.
65,00:04:10.40,00:04:10.40,Mm-mm-mm.
66,00:04:12.50,00:04:12.50,"He was, like, ""Yeah, you know,members of Chuay Gahn told us"
67,00:04:14.37,00:04:14.37,"to vote Ken or Ted."""
68,00:04:15.37,00:04:15.37,"""Oh, yeah? Get out of here."
69,00:04:16.37,00:04:16.37,"Who... who told you guys?"""
70,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77,"And he was like, ""Well, you knowthere's three members."""
71,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,"I was like, ""Who?"""
72,00:04:21.80,00:04:21.80,"He said, ""Well, you know,I'd rather not say."""
73,00:04:23.23,00:04:23.23,"And I was like, ""Whatever."""
74,00:04:24.90,00:04:24.90,He's nuts.
75,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40,"""No one told youto do that,"" you know?"
76,00:04:28.57,00:04:28.57,CLAY: Tribal Council was pretty interesting.
77,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40, Kind of scared old Ted.
78,00:04:32.20,00:04:32.20,He got a reawakening last night
79,00:04:33.33,00:04:33.33,when he saw his name pop upon those cards.
80,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,He didn't like it at all.
81,00:04:36.13,00:04:36.13,The girls didn't tell...any which way to go.
82,00:04:38.00,00:04:38.00,We didn't tell anybody elsewhich way to go.
83,00:04:39.43,00:04:39.43,"You guys,don't even worry about it."
84,00:04:40.80,00:04:40.80,"-Yeah, I know. -When he wastelling me that bull junk,"
85,00:04:43.13,00:04:43.13,"I was like, ""Whatever."""
86,00:04:44.63,00:04:44.63,"CLAY: If Ted goes to believin' Jake, it'll be"
87,00:04:46.37,00:04:46.37,a cold day in hell.It's not going to happen.
88,00:04:48.10,00:04:48.10, Ted doesn't know we instigated
89,00:04:49.50,00:04:49.50," those three votes for him, and he won't."
90,00:04:50.87,00:04:50.87, We've been too true to Ted.
91,00:04:52.33,00:04:52.33," The whole tribe has been too true to Ted,"
92,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,so why should he distrust us?
93,00:04:56.13,00:04:56.13,"BRIAN: What's he thinking,just coming over here,"
94,00:04:57.43,00:04:57.43,start playingboth sides of the fence?
95,00:04:58.77,00:04:58.77,-I don't know.-That's a bad business decision.
96,00:05:01.50,00:05:01.50," Right now, Jake is playing both sides of the fence."
97,00:05:04.47,00:05:04.47, He's playing me a little bit.
98,00:05:05.70,00:05:05.70,He's playing Clay a little bit.
99,00:05:06.83,00:05:06.83, He's voting against Ted
100,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17," and then trying to suck up to him in the morning,"
101,00:05:09.80,00:05:09.80, which is a little surprising
102,00:05:11.53,00:05:11.53," for a man of his age and his stature,"
103,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00, but I think he's a little insecure out here.
104,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,"The air, the heat,the whole jungle experience"
105,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"might be getting to him,but it's getting"
106,00:05:19.37,00:05:19.37, to all of us a little bit; it's getting a little bit
107,00:05:21.27,00:05:21.27, tougher every day. Food is getting scarcer.
108,00:05:22.93,00:05:22.93," We're just trying to, trying to maintain,"
109,00:05:24.53,00:05:24.53, and those that lose their cool--
110,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97," they're the onesthat might have a problem here,"
111,00:05:28.57,00:05:28.57,sooner than later.
112,00:05:29.97,00:05:29.97,"Any luck, Jake?"
113,00:05:31.33,00:05:31.33,JAKE:I found a few.
114,00:05:33.30,00:05:33.30,"Kind of rough out there, huh?"
115,00:05:35.43,00:05:35.43,"Yeah, it was."
116,00:05:36.60,00:05:36.60,I'll have to go again herein a little bit.
117,00:05:37.93,00:05:37.93,"BRIAN: Yeah, waiting forthe tide abit, that'll help."
118,00:05:39.53,00:05:39.53,"CLAY: We haven't been able to catch a crab in ten days,"
119,00:05:41.20,00:05:41.20,'cause the tideis not goin' down.
120,00:05:44.47,00:05:44.47,It has been up for ten daysand it is driving us crazy.
121,00:05:47.80,00:05:47.80,"Look at how deep it is, andwe're right here by the inlet."
122,00:05:49.47,00:05:49.47,"I know-- I tell you,I've never seen water like this."
123,00:05:51.73,00:05:51.73,"HELEN: It's, like, part ofthe starvation thing out here."
124,00:05:54.37,00:05:54.37,"If they keep the tide high tillwe go home, we can't eat."
125,00:05:56.77,00:05:56.77,JAN:The only thing left to eat is--
126,00:05:58.53,00:05:58.53,you know what-- the snails.
127,00:06:00.73,00:06:00.73,"No, nope,not resorting to that, sorry."
128,00:06:02.80,00:06:02.80,"CLAY: As far as food, that's it."
129,00:06:04.47,00:06:04.47," The chickens are all gone, so now we're eating chicken feed"
130,00:06:06.83,00:06:06.83, that came with the chickens
131,00:06:08.03,00:06:08.03," to feed them, to take care of them,"
132,00:06:10.27,00:06:10.27, but it sure would be nice to have something stocked up
133,00:06:12.67,00:06:12.67, or else win one of those big huge meals
134,00:06:14.17,00:06:14.17, where you go sit down
135,00:06:15.33,00:06:15.33,and just-- get-get full.
136,00:06:17.23,00:06:17.23,You know whatthat'd do to my energy?
137,00:06:18.87,00:06:18.87,"Wow, I'd climb oneof these cliffs today."
138,00:06:29.17,00:06:29.17,"PROBST:Hello, guys."
139,00:06:31.13,00:06:31.13,Welcome to another hot dayin paradise.
140,00:06:34.70,00:06:34.70,Today's reward challenge isa four-stage obstacle course.
141,00:06:39.17,00:06:39.17,Each stage is designedto eliminate players.

145,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,"but since there are sevenof you, one person will be"
146,00:06:49.90,00:06:49.90,eliminated right off the bat.
147,00:06:52.13,00:06:52.13,The rest of you will maneuveracross the tops of six towers
148,00:06:55.33,00:06:55.33,"along your color-coded course,using two planks"
149,00:06:57.60,00:06:57.60,to bridge the gaps.
150,00:06:59.47,00:06:59.47,"If you fall off,"
151,00:07:00.70,00:07:00.70,you gotta go backto the beginning and start over.
152,00:07:03.00,00:07:03.00,The first two pairs to make it
153,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,all the way acrossmove on to the next round.

158,00:07:16.77,00:07:16.77,You must use the aid of anothertribe member to get you over.
159,00:07:20.50,00:07:20.50,First two over move on.
160,00:07:22.13,00:07:22.13,"For the last leg,"

170,00:07:42.07,00:07:42.07,"and when you're finished,"
171,00:07:43.13,00:07:43.13,you'll havea beautiful Thai lunch.

197,00:08:47.27,00:08:47.27,We're looking for one more pair.
198,00:08:53.47,00:08:53.47,All right.
199,00:08:54.57,00:08:54.57,Go across.
200,00:08:55.67,00:08:55.67,"PROBST: No, no, no, no, no,got to use"
201,00:08:57.30,00:08:57.30,the boards to get across.
202,00:08:58.37,00:08:58.37,Think.

236,00:10:21.57,00:10:21.57,"The political part is,you must use the aid"
237,00:10:24.37,00:10:24.37,of another tribe memberto get you over.

288,00:12:21.20,00:12:21.20,"So, Clay, I couldn'tbe here without you."

303,00:13:15.63,00:13:15.63,-I do have a date-- with Brian.-Oh! Chill!
304,00:13:18.13,00:13:18.13,Yep. I may stop offand have a brunch.

308,00:13:26.10,00:13:26.10, was a big disappointment to me initially because...
309,00:13:30.37,00:13:30.37,"I hate losing, period."
310,00:13:32.30,00:13:32.30, I was also kind of shocked that Brian did pick Clay
311,00:13:35.90,00:13:35.90, to go with him on the trip.
312,00:13:37.77,00:13:37.77,"-Oh, yeah. What's our story?-Okay."

316,00:13:43.20,00:13:43.20,-nothing's changed.-Talk to you later on.
317,00:13:44.57,00:13:44.57,TED: I kind of knew there was a bond
318,00:13:46.83,00:13:46.83," between Clay and Brian, but the fact"
319,00:13:48.73,00:13:48.73,that he did select Claykind of just told me
320,00:13:50.73,00:13:50.73,that that bond is closerthan what I thought it was.
321,00:13:52.87,00:13:52.87,Does my hat look good?
322,00:13:54.30,00:13:54.30,You look ready.

328,00:14:06.47,00:14:06.47, and my agreement with Clay is another.
329,00:14:08.17,00:14:08.17,I have to see which option--which plan--
330,00:14:10.43,00:14:10.43,is going to work best for me
331,00:14:12.63,00:14:12.63," down the road,'cause that's part of the plan."

344,00:14:46.50,00:14:46.50, and this is an excellent time for us
345,00:14:48.10,00:14:48.10," to just clear our heads, get away from everyone."
346,00:14:50.37,00:14:50.37,Relaxation is the key.
347,00:14:55.10,00:14:55.10,"-Whoo!-Whoo, daddy!"
348,00:14:57.03,00:14:57.03,"BRIAN: Well, it was my first time being in a helicopter."
349,00:14:59.47,00:14:59.47, I was a little apprehensive at first-- a little nervous--
350,00:15:01.87,00:15:01.87," but it was like riding a roller coaster,"
351,00:15:03.40,00:15:03.40,and I enjoyed it immensely.
352,00:15:11.57,00:15:11.57,"CLAY: We flew for about 45, 50 minutes,"
353,00:15:14.17,00:15:14.17," all the way to the mainland of Thailand, and, uh..."
354,00:15:16.83,00:15:16.83,put us on a bus that took usway out in the jungle.
355,00:15:18.93,00:15:18.93," You know, you wondered where this trip was going to end."
356,00:15:26.67,00:15:26.67,Ah.
357,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57,"Wonder-- Mr. Clay, sir,I have your elephant, sir,"

359,00:15:33.47,00:15:33.47,Welcome to the elephant trek.
360,00:15:36.80,00:15:36.80,CLAY: There was a Thai lady standing there
361,00:15:38.27,00:15:38.27, with two glasses of juice.
362,00:15:39.43,00:15:39.43,-Cheers.-Salute to you.

371,00:15:58.43,00:15:58.43,You can rest your feeton the back here.
372,00:16:00.13,00:16:00.13,"You can sit on the back,all right?"
373,00:16:02.13,00:16:02.13,"BRIAN: Immediately, we jumped onto this elephant."
374,00:16:03.37,00:16:03.37,-Right here?-BRIAN: Okay.
375,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17,-On here?-Yes.

383,00:16:18.73,00:16:18.73,"-Whoo, it's a big elephant.-Nice ass."
384,00:16:24.57,00:16:24.57,"-What, about 20 feet up?-Yeah."
385,00:16:26.20,00:16:26.20,Not too high for me to jumpif I need to.
386,00:16:28.13,00:16:28.13,-(chuckling)-At all.
387,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,BRIAN: Riding the elephant itself was a little spooky
388,00:16:33.60,00:16:33.60, and very uncomfortable.
389,00:16:35.63,00:16:35.63," I was looking at this guy down here who had all the control,"
390,00:16:37.70,00:16:37.70, holding it by its ear.
391,00:16:39.70,00:16:39.70,"Every time he stepsabout ten feet away from it,"
392,00:16:41.33,00:16:41.33,"I was like, ""Excuse me."""

394,00:16:44.63,00:16:44.63,"Hey, excuse me."
395,00:16:47.40,00:16:47.40,"CLAY: I tried to relax and go with the flow,"
396,00:16:49.67,00:16:49.67, but Brian was terrified of this elephant.
397,00:16:54.93,00:16:54.93,He had a death gripon the side of his chair
398,00:16:56.97,00:16:56.97, the whole time.
399,00:16:58.10,00:16:58.10," At any minute, he was ready to jump."
400,00:17:00.33,00:17:00.33," For two hours, he stayed on""go"" to jump off this elephant."
401,00:17:06.87,00:17:06.87,"CLAY:Boy, look at that mountain."
402,00:17:08.13,00:17:08.13,BRIAN:I know.
403,00:17:09.27,00:17:09.27,"But look atthis countryside, though."
404,00:17:10.30,00:17:10.30,CLAY:It is some pretty country.
405,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,CLAY: It is absolutely gorgeous.
406,00:17:20.93,00:17:20.93, You got these limestone cliffs
407,00:17:22.53,00:17:22.53, and mountains and hills and caves.
408,00:17:24.90,00:17:24.90," There's no way to describe the beauty that-that's here,"
409,00:17:28.30,00:17:28.30,"that, uh,is off the beaten track,"
410,00:17:30.10,00:17:30.10,and the worldreally doesn't know it's here.
411,00:17:31.70,00:17:31.70,Gosh almighty.
412,00:17:35.10,00:17:35.10,(low rumbling)
413,00:17:36.60,00:17:36.60,"Oh, hell."
414,00:17:37.80,00:17:37.80,-Sounded like a fart.-(squeaky farting)
415,00:17:39.53,00:17:39.53,-We got some serious... (laughs)-(rumbling fart)
416,00:17:41.90,00:17:41.90,She's farting.
417,00:17:43.20,00:17:43.20,"Oh, yeah. No problem."
418,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,"-She feels better now, eh?-Oh, yeah."
419,00:17:47.20,00:17:47.20,That's what you callblowing your nose.
420,00:17:52.70,00:17:52.70,BRIAN: Tell you what--I forgot about all the bullcrap
421,00:17:54.30,00:17:54.30,that's going on at camp.Haven't you for a while?
422,00:17:56.63,00:17:56.63,"-I know it. Well, Jake...-Yeah, you know he's trying"
423,00:17:58.40,00:17:58.40,to control that camp right now.
424,00:17:59.60,00:17:59.60,"-Oh, man.-He's going to try."
425,00:18:01.17,00:18:01.17,Yep.
426,00:18:05.43,00:18:05.43,(screeches)
427,00:18:10.43,00:18:10.43,JAKE:This is nice.
428,00:18:11.73,00:18:11.73,-This is fun today.-Yep.
429,00:18:13.93,00:18:13.93,"We're not in the helicopter,but we're in the canoe."
430,00:18:16.33,00:18:16.33,That's okay.
431,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,Can we talk without itgoing out of the canoe?
432,00:18:20.23,00:18:20.23,"Oh, yes. Yes, sir."
433,00:18:21.57,00:18:21.57,JAKE:Just between you and I...
434,00:18:24.37,00:18:24.37,Brian and Clayare going to win the game.
435,00:18:26.47,00:18:26.47,"HELEN: Jake and I went over for the canoe trip today,"
436,00:18:28.73,00:18:28.73," and, uh, the last thing Clay and Brian said to me"
437,00:18:30.83,00:18:30.83," before they left was keep an eye on ""the snake."""
438,00:18:32.73,00:18:32.73,That's what their term isfor Jake.
439,00:18:38.00,00:18:38.00,"JAKE: Well, and the only wayanybody can win this game,"
440,00:18:40.77,00:18:40.77,"at this point, is to get ridof at least one of those guys,"
441,00:18:44.83,00:18:44.83,and possibly two.
442,00:18:46.73,00:18:46.73,You got a good point.
443,00:18:48.03,00:18:48.03,Would you like to knowwhat their pecking order is?
444,00:18:49.97,00:18:49.97,'Cause I talked to boththose guys about what it is.
445,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,-Really?-Uh-huh.
446,00:18:53.37,00:18:53.37,"-You're kidding me.-No, they have a pecking order."
447,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,HELEN: He seemed to have a voting order down.
448,00:18:58.20,00:18:58.20,"That's something I've heardfrom my own tribe mates,"
449,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47, so he's getting information somewhere.
450,00:19:03.77,00:19:03.77,I told Ted why I voted for him.
451,00:19:06.40,00:19:06.40,-You did?-I did.
452,00:19:07.90,00:19:07.90,"I said, ""I was toldto vote for you--"
453,00:19:09.83,00:19:09.83,"to either vote for you or Ken."""
454,00:19:11.43,00:19:11.43,Wow.
455,00:19:12.73,00:19:12.73,JAKE: You got to keep trying.
456,00:19:14.57,00:19:14.57,"I mean, what can I do?"
457,00:19:15.90,00:19:15.90,"I can sit hereand get voted off,"
458,00:19:17.77,00:19:17.77, or I can stir up a little something
459,00:19:20.30,00:19:20.30, that might get me a little bit further.
460,00:19:22.40,00:19:22.40,I've got nothing to lose.
461,00:19:23.77,00:19:23.77,"Well, what I'm saying to youis I think you got"
462,00:19:26.07,00:19:26.07,a good chanceof winning the game.
463,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,You... you could probablywin it over Clay.
464,00:19:29.33,00:19:29.33,I don't... I'm not sureyou can win it over Brian.
465,00:19:31.03,00:19:31.03,"No, I don't, either.I don't think so."
466,00:19:32.43,00:19:32.43,"So... so as much as I love him,for you to win it,"
467,00:19:34.77,00:19:34.77,you'd have to take him out.
468,00:19:36.23,00:19:36.23,JAKE: I gave her some things to think about today.
469,00:19:38.10,00:19:38.10," I mean, a million dollars,"
470,00:19:39.63,00:19:39.63,"as opposed to nothing,is a pretty big reason"
471,00:19:43.30,00:19:43.30,"to turn on somebody, regardlessof how much you like them."
472,00:19:45.97,00:19:45.97,"Well, how would you proposegetting rid of, say, Clay?"
473,00:19:49.47,00:19:49.47,I mean...
474,00:19:50.90,00:19:50.90,"Well, the... the only proposalI could offer is--"
475,00:19:55.27,00:19:55.27,"tomorrow, we go to challenge."
476,00:19:57.03,00:19:57.03,"If one ofthose two guys gets it,"
477,00:19:58.87,00:19:58.87,we vote the other one off.
478,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,That's the only waywe could do it.
479,00:20:02.10,00:20:02.10,HELEN: Now I'm going to be deepin thought the rest of the day.
480,00:20:05.40,00:20:05.40," Is he being up front with me and honest, or is this his way"
481,00:20:08.00,00:20:08.00,of playing the gameand staying on?
482,00:20:10.03,00:20:10.03,"Um, if I were in his position,I'd be doing everything I could"
483,00:20:13.27,00:20:13.27,to eke out threeor six more days.
484,00:20:15.40,00:20:15.40,You're the only person I seewho can beat those two guys.
485,00:20:19.00,00:20:19.00,JAKE: I think Helen could possibly win this
486,00:20:21.83,00:20:21.83,"if she got rid of both Brianand, uh... and Clay."
487,00:20:25.00,00:20:25.00,HELEN:That is very interesting.
488,00:20:27.03,00:20:27.03,"JAKE: Of course, if she got rid of Brian and Clay,"
489,00:20:30.10,00:20:30.10,"I think I'd be back in the hunt,and I think Penny would also."
490,00:20:43.43,00:20:43.43,My gosh.
491,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87,I can't wait.
492,00:20:46.03,00:20:46.03,"BRIAN: We came back to our, uh,"
493,00:20:47.70,00:20:47.70," starting point with the elephant, and--"
494,00:20:49.10,00:20:49.10,ta-da-- a feast;a feast fit for a king.
495,00:20:53.87,00:20:53.87,-CLAY: I want the silver---We have more for you.
496,00:20:56.20,00:20:56.20,-Holy hell. Yes!-Oh...
497,00:20:57.90,00:20:57.90,-Tempura.-I've never been...
498,00:20:59.73,00:20:59.73,felt this wayabout food in my life.
499,00:21:01.97,00:21:01.97,"-Fried noodle, Thai style.-Whoo!"
500,00:21:04.50,00:21:04.50,"(sighs) Lord, look atall this stuff."
501,00:21:06.20,00:21:06.20,"-My God, I just want to scream.-I feel the food going,"
502,00:21:09.00,00:21:09.00,"""What's this going on here?""My stomach's going..."
503,00:21:10.70,00:21:10.70,"My stomach is saying,""You feed me leaves and bark,"
504,00:21:12.60,00:21:12.60,"and all of a sudden you putsomething that I can... I like."""
505,00:21:15.03,00:21:15.03,CLAY: We ate every kindof Thai food you could imagine.
506,00:21:17.63,00:21:17.63," It was the best food I've had in, seemed like, 30 years."
507,00:21:20.80,00:21:20.80,I forgot that foodactually had a taste to it.
508,00:21:23.47,00:21:23.47,Let's see what this beertastes like.
509,00:21:26.63,00:21:26.63,-Not a bad beer.-Not a bad beer.
510,00:21:27.90,00:21:27.90,-Know what I mean?-The trip home will not be long.
511,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,(laughing)
512,00:21:33.37,00:21:33.37,CLAY: We had a lot of laughs.
513,00:21:34.77,00:21:34.77, Me and Brian are definitely tight.
514,00:21:36.53,00:21:36.53, You can't beat things like that.
515,00:21:38.43,00:21:38.43," There is more, uh, bonding goes on"
516,00:21:40.83,00:21:40.83,"in a trip like that than, uh...uh, six months back in America."
517,00:21:43.50,00:21:43.50,(belches)Excuse me.
518,00:21:45.27,00:21:45.27,"BRIAN: Well, I don't thinkI would've had this good a time"
519,00:21:47.27,00:21:47.27, with anybody else. It was great
520,00:21:48.47,00:21:48.47," sharing it with him. He enjoyed it,"
521,00:21:49.83,00:21:49.83,and he would have donethe same for me.
522,00:21:53.13,00:21:53.13,"CLAY: When we got through eating, we had some, uh, soup"
523,00:21:55.97,00:21:55.97, with some big old shrimp leftover that we...
524,00:21:57.20,00:21:57.20, we... there's no way we could eat.
525,00:21:58.60,00:21:58.60," So I, uh, got to putting the shrimp"
526,00:22:00.40,00:22:00.40, and all this soup in this canteen.
527,00:22:03.27,00:22:03.27,BRIAN:You must have been hungry.
528,00:22:05.50,00:22:05.50,(both laughing)
529,00:22:08.03,00:22:08.03,"CLAY: And the other canteen,"
530,00:22:09.43,00:22:09.43, I emptied it out and filled it up
531,00:22:10.93,00:22:10.93," with the beer that we had. We had, uh,"
532,00:22:12.47,00:22:12.47, two and a half bottles left of beer.
533,00:22:13.93,00:22:13.93," So, uh, I get to go back to camp,"
534,00:22:16.03,00:22:16.03," say, ""Look what I brought y'all."""
535,00:22:17.40,00:22:17.40, If I make it to one
536,00:22:18.83,00:22:18.83,"of those two final chairs,maybe they'll remember."
537,00:22:21.20,00:22:21.20,"""Let me put old Clay down."
538,00:22:22.77,00:22:22.77,"He did think of meearlier in the game."""
539,00:22:24.80,00:22:24.80,My stomach's so small right now.
540,00:22:26.37,00:22:26.37,"That baby is going,""I'm happy. I'm happy."""
541,00:22:29.63,00:22:29.63,(both laughing)
542,00:22:42.40,00:22:42.40,JAKE:Pretty nice crab.

552,00:22:58.40,00:22:58.40,-Do you need help?-(grunts)
553,00:22:59.77,00:22:59.77,BRIAN:  They all were out in the water
554,00:23:01.47,00:23:01.47," waiting for us like, uh, lost sheep"
555,00:23:03.70,00:23:03.70,longing for their masters.
556,00:23:05.20,00:23:05.20,(chuckles)

808,00:33:21.67,00:33:21.67,"I'll remember that, too, Helen.Thank you."
809,00:33:22.93,00:33:22.93,PROBST:Here's where we're at:
810,00:33:24.77,00:33:24.77,Big Ted has one torch.Helen has one torch.
811,00:33:27.20,00:33:27.20,Next question:
812,00:33:29.23,00:33:29.23,Which of these countries
813,00:33:31.07,00:33:31.07,does not sharea border with Thailand--
814,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,"A: Cambodia, B: Vietnam,"
815,00:33:38.33,00:33:38.33,"C: Malaysia, or D: Laos?"
816,00:33:42.33,00:33:42.33,Big Ted says C: Malaysia.
817,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,That is not right.
818,00:33:46.90,00:33:46.90,Helen says B: Vietnam.That is right.
819,00:33:50.43,00:33:50.43,Snuff his torch.
820,00:33:52.00,00:33:52.00,"-JAN: Good job.-I'm sorry, Ted. I'm sorry."
821,00:33:54.70,00:33:54.70,"That was fun, huh?That was fun."
822,00:33:55.83,00:33:55.83,"Ted, have a seat on the bench."
823,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,"-(squeals)-Hang tight, Helen. Nicely done."
824,00:34:01.20,00:34:01.20,Thank you.
825,00:34:05.37,00:34:05.37,-Safe from the vote tonight.-That's cool.
826,00:34:07.73,00:34:07.73,Guaranteed a one-in-six shotat being the sole survivor.
827,00:34:10.30,00:34:10.30,"For the rest of you,Tribal Council looms."
828,00:34:12.70,00:34:12.70,One of youwill be going home tonight.
829,00:34:14.93,00:34:14.93,Lead them back to camp.
830,00:34:16.40,00:34:16.40,You guys can head out.
831,00:34:33.77,00:34:33.77,"Congratulations, H."
832,00:34:35.37,00:34:35.37,"-Yeah, good job.-Heck of a job."
833,00:34:39.80,00:34:39.80,"-Snuff city, huh?-I didn't know any of those."
834,00:34:41.57,00:34:41.57,"She snuffed me right out,right from the beginning."
835,00:34:43.47,00:34:43.47,I knew you knew it all.
836,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,"JAKE: Well, I guess the thing"
837,00:34:46.77,00:34:46.77, that bothered me mostis Penny came up and snuffed me
838,00:34:49.43,00:34:49.43, right from the very beginning.
839,00:34:50.80,00:34:50.80," But, you know, I guess she had her reasons."
840,00:34:52.73,00:34:52.73,"I don't know what they were,but she had her reasons."
841,00:34:56.83,00:34:56.83,"PENNY: I wasn't quite sure exactly,"
842,00:34:58.47,00:34:58.47," um, if I should snuff out Jake or not, but I guess"
843,00:35:01.00,00:35:01.00, I was trying to send a message to Chuay Gahn that Jake and I
844,00:35:04.53,00:35:04.53," don't really have an alliance anymore,"
845,00:35:07.37,00:35:07.37,and I wanted them to see that.
846,00:35:10.40,00:35:10.40,BRIAN:Let's think about this.
847,00:35:11.63,00:35:11.63,HELEN:I think the snake has to go.
848,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"Yeah, me, too."
849,00:35:15.13,00:35:15.13,The snake has to go.
850,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,-You mean Jake?-Uh-huh.
851,00:35:17.47,00:35:17.47,-Number one?-Number one.
852,00:35:20.13,00:35:20.13,"TED:That's a wrong move, man."
853,00:35:23.20,00:35:23.20,TED: I consider Penny a Trojan horse.
854,00:35:25.53,00:35:25.53," Um, she puts on her charm and sweetness and etcetera,"
855,00:35:28.77,00:35:28.77, but she has a game plan underneath.
856,00:35:31.13,00:35:31.13,"-BRIAN: He's more of a predator.-TED: Oh, yeah."
857,00:35:32.90,00:35:32.90,TED: She's charming Brian and Clay.
858,00:35:35.20,00:35:35.20," Just to kind of prevent her charm from working,"
859,00:35:38.63,00:35:38.63,I think it's importantfor us to vote her off.
860,00:35:40.67,00:35:40.67,Are you okay with this or no?
861,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,"Um, I just thinkhe's more of a predator."
862,00:35:43.40,00:35:43.40,"-I don't know.-TED: Oh, no."
863,00:35:44.70,00:35:44.70,"Oh, here she comes."
864,00:35:45.97,00:35:45.97,We'll just wait until later.
865,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,JAKE: You can see them kind of
866,00:35:48.70,00:35:48.70," whispering around, so I know it's all going on."
867,00:35:51.27,00:35:51.27, So I'm trying to get a chance
868,00:35:52.70,00:35:52.70,"to get Ted off over to the side and say, ""Ted,"
869,00:35:56.43,00:35:56.43,"if you vote for me,you'll be next."""
870,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40," It's not over till the fat lady sings,"
871,00:36:03.67,00:36:03.67,but I think I can hear herwarming up.
872,00:36:06.23,00:36:06.23,(humming)
873,00:36:22.80,00:36:22.80,"We'll now bring inthe two members of our jury,"
874,00:36:24.80,00:36:24.80,Erin and Ken.
875,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"Hey, guys."
876,00:36:30.80,00:36:30.80,-Hi.-Hi.
877,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"So, when each tribefirst came to Tribal Council,"
878,00:36:35.80,00:36:35.80,I said that thisis where you account
879,00:36:38.27,00:36:38.27,for your actions on the island.
880,00:36:40.27,00:36:40.27,"Across from you guys,nine torches."
881,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,Nine people voted out.
882,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27,"Big Ted, you thinkthat's held true so far?"
883,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,"I really do believe that, um,the people who have..."
884,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83,who have been voted out so far
885,00:36:51.83,00:36:51.83,were voted outbecause of their actions.
886,00:36:54.10,00:36:54.10,"And as the game progresses,it's kind of hard"
887,00:36:57.00,00:36:57.00,"to hold ontothat philosophy because, um,"
888,00:37:00.40,00:37:00.40,"the closer we gettoward the million dollars,"
889,00:37:03.20,00:37:03.20,"um, a lot of peoplewill be motivated by money."
890,00:37:05.87,00:37:05.87,"And when you're motivatedby money,"
891,00:37:08.63,00:37:08.63,you're thinking more selfishly.
892,00:37:10.23,00:37:10.23,"-Jake, you agree with that?-Well,"
893,00:37:13.23,00:37:13.23,"we've let some people gothat were really strong people,"
894,00:37:16.53,00:37:16.53,"especially in our tribe,"
895,00:37:17.97,00:37:17.97,because we didn't particularlylike their actions.
896,00:37:20.77,00:37:20.77,Now I think we've kind of taken
897,00:37:22.23,00:37:22.23,a different approachin the game.
898,00:37:24.63,00:37:24.63,"And to me now, it's:how can I, for example,"
899,00:37:28.40,00:37:28.40,set up with someone elseand form an alliance
900,00:37:30.90,00:37:30.90,that's a win-win for both of us?
901,00:37:33.10,00:37:33.10,And that's the way I thinkthe game is played.
902,00:37:35.57,00:37:35.57,"PROBST:Clay, you think deception"
903,00:37:37.27,00:37:37.27,has been going on first 30 days?
904,00:37:39.73,00:37:39.73,"I mean, it's to outwit,outplay and outlast,"
905,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,and that's the nameof this game.
906,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,"I mean, we're all...we got our own strategies,"
907,00:37:46.40,00:37:46.40,and we're all tryingto get to the top.
908,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,"And, uh, I'm sure everybody'sdone their fair share."
909,00:37:52.57,00:37:52.57,"PROBST:Penny,"
910,00:37:54.20,00:37:54.20,anything wrongwith deceiving in this game?
911,00:37:56.97,00:37:56.97,Depends on when you're deceivingand how you're deceiving.
912,00:38:00.27,00:38:00.27,"Um, of course,you would hope that people"
913,00:38:03.23,00:38:03.23,"who you talk toare, um, being honest"
914,00:38:07.03,00:38:07.03,"and faithful to you,but, um, this is a game."
915,00:38:10.60,00:38:10.60,"Jan, are you startingto wonder more"
916,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,about conversations that happenwhen you're not around?
917,00:38:15.30,00:38:15.30,Absolutely.
918,00:38:16.57,00:38:16.57,It's happening more and more--
919,00:38:18.17,00:38:18.17,"the whispers, the going off,the talking,"
920,00:38:20.23,00:38:20.23,the trying to form alliances.
921,00:38:23.77,00:38:23.77,"Yes, it is."
922,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,"Well, we had a very lateimmunity challenge today."
923,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,"You guys went back to your camp,"
924,00:38:29.97,00:38:29.97,"really, with just enough timeto grab your personal items,"
925,00:38:32.43,00:38:32.43,so if there's anythingthat anybody wants to say
926,00:38:35.73,00:38:35.73,"that you didn't get a chanceto say back at camp,"
927,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,now is the time.
928,00:38:39.33,00:38:39.33,JAKE:I'll say something.
929,00:38:40.83,00:38:40.83,"At last Tribal Council,"
930,00:38:42.43,00:38:42.43,I heard from this tribethat they usually
931,00:38:46.37,00:38:46.37,vote people off based onhow a person really performs.
932,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,"Now, I still feelin a very vulnerable position,"
933,00:38:52.60,00:38:52.60,"as I'm sure Penny does,"
934,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,"but if you base iton performance,"
935,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,I think my performancestands up to...
936,00:39:00.50,00:39:00.50,to everybody's on the tribeand probably better than most.
937,00:39:03.77,00:39:03.77,"And so I'll bekind of curious tonight,"
938,00:39:06.00,00:39:06.00,see if that performance recordstill holds up.
939,00:39:08.27,00:39:08.27,Anybody have a response to that?
940,00:39:12.70,00:39:12.70,Very good. All right.
941,00:39:14.27,00:39:14.27,"Helen, it is time to vote."
942,00:39:16.10,00:39:16.10,You're up first.
943,00:39:31.60,00:39:31.60,"Jake, I didn't like yourstatement you just made"
944,00:39:34.43,00:39:34.43,"about, uh, doing allyou can and, uh,"
945,00:39:36.63,00:39:36.63,"you was goin' to be surprisedif you're voted off,"
946,00:39:39.17,00:39:39.17,because your mouthhas definitely
947,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,overloaded your butt.
948,00:39:55.97,00:39:55.97,"Tonight, my vote is for Jake,"
949,00:39:58.63,00:39:58.63,"because I'm trying to keepmyself alive in this game,"
950,00:40:02.03,00:40:02.03,and I feel this is the only waythat I can do it right now.
951,00:40:15.53,00:40:15.53,"Man, I gotta give it to you."
952,00:40:17.50,00:40:17.50,"You're good;you're very, very good."
953,00:40:19.30,00:40:19.30,Your deceivingSouthern belle charm
954,00:40:21.87,00:40:21.87,first worked on Jake;
955,00:40:23.27,00:40:23.27,now it's starting to workon Brian and Clay.
956,00:40:25.77,00:40:25.77,"But, unfortunately,I'm not falling for it."
957,00:40:28.57,00:40:28.57,Take care.
958,00:40:44.63,00:40:44.63,I'll go tally the votes.
959,00:40:56.27,00:40:56.27,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
960,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
961,00:41:00.73,00:41:00.73,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
962,00:41:02.37,00:41:02.37,I'll read the votes.
963,00:41:07.23,00:41:07.23,First vote.
964,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,Jake.
965,00:41:17.10,00:41:17.10,Penny.
966,00:41:18.33,00:41:18.33,"One vote Jake, one vote Penny."
967,00:41:24.60,00:41:24.60,Jan.
968,00:41:27.03,00:41:27.03,"That's one vote Jake,one vote Penny, one vote Jan."
969,00:41:32.67,00:41:32.67,Jake.Two votes Jake.
970,00:41:38.87,00:41:38.87,"Penny.Two votes Jake,"
971,00:41:40.10,00:41:40.10,"two votes Penny,one vote Jan."
972,00:41:45.77,00:41:45.77,That's three votes Penny.
973,00:41:51.17,00:41:51.17,The tenth person voted outof the tribe:
974,00:41:53.37,00:41:53.37,Penny.
975,00:41:54.70,00:41:54.70,Need to bring me your torch.
976,00:42:04.77,00:42:04.77,"Penny, the tribe has spoken."
977,00:42:09.97,00:42:09.97,It's time for you to go.
978,00:42:11.27,00:42:11.27,Bye. Good luck.
979,00:42:12.67,00:42:12.67,(no voice)
980,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,"PROBST:Well, it's clear that you've"
981,00:42:28.53,00:42:28.53,endured a lotover the last 30 days.
982,00:42:31.23,00:42:31.23,But these last nine dayswill prove to be the toughest.
983,00:42:36.00,00:42:36.00,You guys can head back to camp.
984,00:42:37.27,00:42:37.27,Good night.
985,00:42:48.03,00:42:48.03,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
986,00:42:54.10,00:42:54.10, Next time on Survivor:
987,00:42:56.00,00:42:56.00," In a special episode, we'll revisit"
988,00:42:57.97,00:42:57.97, the first 30 days through highlights.
989,00:43:00.00,00:43:00.00,(screaming)
990,00:43:02.47,00:43:02.47,What was that?
991,00:43:03.70,00:43:03.70,PROBST: And never-before-seen footage.
992,00:43:05.50,00:43:05.50,JAKE: I've done a lot of canoeing.
993,00:43:06.87,00:43:06.87, That was the worst canoe I've ever been in
994,00:43:09.63,00:43:09.63, in my entire life.
995,00:43:10.93,00:43:10.93, How many of you vote
996,00:43:12.27,00:43:12.27,for burning the ... canoe?!
997,00:43:19.27,00:43:19.27,"Well, I definitelywasn't ready to leave the game,"
998,00:43:21.33,00:43:21.33,"but I guess,in a weird sort of way,"
999,00:43:23.30,00:43:23.30,it was a nice compliment to seethat I was seen as a threat.
1000,00:43:27.03,00:43:27.03,I came out here knowingI was one of 16
1001,00:43:29.33,00:43:29.33,"and, um, just wanted to seehow far I could get in the game."
1002,00:43:33.27,00:43:33.27,And to know that I was ableto accomplish that
1003,00:43:36.60,00:43:36.60,really does surprise me.
1004,00:43:37.80,00:43:37.80,I'm very proud of myself.
