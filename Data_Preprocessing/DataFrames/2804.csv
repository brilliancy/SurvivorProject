187,00:12:48.87,00:12:48.87,VERY CLOSE TO REWARD. SOLANA COULD WIN IT.
188,00:12:55.13,00:12:55.13,AND THEY DO. SOLANA WINS REWARD!
189,00:13:00.63,00:13:00.63,HUGE PHYSICAL EFFORT BY EVERYBODY.
190,00:13:09.20,00:13:09.20,"SOLANA, CONGRATULATION, GRAB YOUR REWARD, HEAD BACK TO CAMP"
191,00:13:11.87,00:13:11.87,AND ENJOY IT. ALL RIGHT.
192,00:13:20.77,00:13:20.77,"APARI, HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU. GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO"
193,00:13:23.40,00:13:23.40,CAMP. >> IT'S NICE TO UPGRADE FROM THE
194,00:13:25.70,00:13:25.70,"MOMS TO THE HOT GIRLS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S TOUGH TO"
195,00:13:28.77,00:13:28.77,KEEP LOSING. EVERYTHING WITH THE BRAINS SEEMS
196,00:13:31.37,00:13:31.37,TO GO WRONG SOMEHOW SOME WAY. >> GOOD JOB ON THAT FIRST
197,00:13:45.90,00:13:45.90,"REWARD, GUYS. >> YEAH."
198,00:13:55.10,00:13:55.10,>> WE WON A CHALLENGE. GOOD NEWS.
199,00:13:57.37,00:13:57.37,THE REALITY IS IT'S BAD NEWS. JEFF AND I ARE OUTNUMBERED 5-2
200,00:14:02.63,00:14:02.63,"BY THE BRAWN TRIBE. I DO HAVE AN IDOL I COULD PLAY,"
201,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,"BUT THAT WOULD ONLY BUY ME A FEW MORE DAYS AND THEN I'M GONE, SO"
202,00:14:10.57,00:14:10.57,MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT THEY ABSORB ME AS A TEAM MEMBER AS OPPOSED
203,00:14:15.27,00:14:15.27,TO A THREAT. >> WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
204,00:14:20.70,00:14:20.70,WHAT ALL YOU ALL DO. >> WHAT DID YOU GUESS?
205,00:14:23.27,00:14:23.27,>> ARE YOU A HAIRDRESSER? THE SCISSORS.
206,00:14:29.07,00:14:29.07,>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE A SURFER. >> I'M MARTIAL AWTS TRAINER.

210,00:14:42.53,00:14:42.53,"WOULD HAVE GUESSED, AND I AM, TOO."
211,00:14:44.53,00:14:44.53,THAT BRINGS US A CONNECTION. YOU WENT TO SAUGUS HIGH?
212,00:14:48.87,00:14:48.87,WHAT YEAR DID YOU GRADUATE? >> '97.
213,00:14:51.60,00:14:51.60,>> I THOUGHT THE BEAUTY TRIBE LOOKED HIGH MAINTENANCE.
214,00:14:55.20,00:14:55.20,L.J. IS LAID BACK. YOU CAN TELL HE'S A GENTLEMAN.
215,00:14:57.60,00:14:57.60,HE'S A BOSTON BOY. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I THOUGHT
216,00:15:04.00,00:15:04.00,"HE'S A NICE BOY. >> I WAS LIKE,ER WANTED TO GET A"
217,00:15:06.90,00:15:06.90,HORSE. >> I THINK L.J.'S A REALLY
218,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,"HANDSOME GUY, BUT I COULD BE HIS MOTHER."
219,00:15:11.57,00:15:11.57,I'M NOT MRS. ROBINSON. >> WHEN TRISH SAID SHE WAS FROM
220,00:15:17.47,00:15:17.47,"BOSTON, IT WAS A MOMENT OF BEAMING SUNSHINE FOR ME."
221,00:15:20.63,00:15:20.63,"WE ALREADY HAVE A CONNECTION, AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON I'M A"
222,00:15:24.57,00:15:24.57,"DRAW TO SOMEBODY A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAT'S SINGLE AND, YOU"
223,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57,"KNOW, BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF, WHETHER IT'S THE SEX"
224,00:15:31.30,00:15:31.30,"APPEAL OR WHATEVER THAT SHE'S DRAWN TO, I'M GOING TO USE IT TO"
225,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,"SAVE MYSELF. >> I HAVE TO GET OUT MORE,"
226,00:15:36.87,00:15:36.87,WHAT'S TWERKING. >> I'D LIKE TO SEE TRISH TWERK.
227,00:15:42.33,00:15:42.33,">> NO ONE WANTS TO SEE TRISH TWERK, TRUST ME."
228,00:15:46.47,00:15:46.47,>> TRISH IS TOTALLY EXAGGERATES HER LAUGH AROUND GUYS AND IT
229,00:15:50.43,00:15:50.43,"MAKES ME SICK. LIKE YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD, STOP"
230,00:15:52.90,00:15:52.90,TRYING TO GET ATTENTION FROM 20-YEAR-OLD MEN.
231,00:15:55.33,00:15:55.33,"SERIOUSLY. >> WHEN I SAW PURPLE, PURPLE, I"
232,00:16:04.93,00:16:04.93,"WAS LIKE, OH, COME ON. >> OH, WOW."
233,00:16:09.30,00:16:09.30,I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WERE MIXED UP TODAY.
234,00:16:11.60,00:16:11.60,I WAS ABLE TO KEEP FIVE OF MY ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF MY TRIBE.
235,00:16:15.77,00:16:15.77,"WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING ON WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE, WE'RE"
236,00:16:19.57,00:16:19.57,IN A GREAT POSITION. THE ONE THING I HATE IS TRISH.
237,00:16:25.63,00:16:25.63,MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS TRISH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
238,00:16:28.83,00:16:28.83,WITH HER AND L.J. I JUST HAVE TO REALLY KEEP AN
239,00:16:32.23,00:16:32.23,EYE ON THE TWO OF THEM. IT'S A MUST.
240,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,">> HIGH-FIVE. >> THANKS, BUDDY."
241,00:16:53.33,00:16:53.33,">> IF I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE GUST, WE WOULD HAVE CLEANED"
242,00:16:57.07,00:16:57.07,UP A LITTLE. YOU'RE NOT THE GUESTS.
243,00:16:59.87,00:16:59.87,MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. >> I'M THE ONLY ORIGINAL APARRI
244,00:17:03.60,00:17:03.60,MEMBER ON A TRIBE WITH THREE BRAINS AND THREE BEAUTIES.
245,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,IT'S DEFINITELY A SCARY POSITION TO BE IN BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
246,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,WHO YOU CAN TRUST AND WHO YOU CAN'T TRUST.
247,00:17:14.63,00:17:14.63,THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO ASK ON DAY ONE WHO TOOK THE FOOD OR DID
248,00:17:19.43,00:17:19.43,THEY TAKE THE RICE. >> WE HAVE TWO BAGS OF RICE HERE
249,00:17:24.00,00:17:24.00,TRISH DIDN'T GO FOR THE IDOL. SHE WENT FOR THE RICE.
250,00:17:26.97,00:17:26.97,>> GARRETT WENT FOR THE IDOL? >> HE DIDN'T TELL US WHAT
251,00:17:30.33,00:17:30.33,HAPPENED. WE WERE GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT.
252,00:17:31.80,00:17:31.80,>> WHAT WAS THE DECISION? >> TAKE RICE OR IDOL?
253,00:17:39.20,00:17:39.20,>> SARAH OUTED ME WHEN SHE SAID TRISH PICKED RICE INSTEAD OF THE
254,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,IDOL BECAUSE I CHOSE THE CLUE AND I KEPT IT A SECRET THE
255,00:17:47.67,00:17:47.67,"ENTIRE TIME, SO HOPEFULLY I KIND OF START FRESH WITH THIS TRIBE"
256,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,AND NO ONE HOLDS IT AGAINST ME. I WENT FOR THE CLUE FOR THE
257,00:17:58.97,00:17:58.97,"IDOL, BUT OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE IT."
258,00:18:01.20,00:18:01.20,">> OH, MY GOD. >> MORGAN LIED DAY ONE, AND IT"
259,00:18:05.27,00:18:05.27,"PUT A BIGGER RIFF, NOT THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE 100 RED FLAGS"
260,00:18:09.13,00:18:09.13,ALREADY. IT TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
261,00:18:11.20,00:18:11.20,"TO KNOW, WHICH IS TO NOT TRUST HER AND NEVER ALLY WITH HER, SO"
262,00:18:14.73,00:18:14.73,I'M GOING TO PROTECT MYSELF AND JUMP SHIP RIGHT AWAY.
263,00:18:23.70,00:18:23.70,>> I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU GUYS.
264,00:18:29.03,00:18:29.03,"MY CLOSEST FRIEND ON MY TRIBE WAS JEFRA, AND SHE'S NOT WITH ME"
265,00:18:33.30,00:18:33.30,"ANYMORE, SO I THINK THE ONLY SCENARIO IS THE SAFEST IS IF THE"
266,00:18:36.60,00:18:36.60,FOUR OF US STICK TOGETHER. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TRUST
267,00:18:39.87,00:18:39.87,"SOMEONE RIGHT AWAY, BUT IF I GIVE YOU MY WORD, I MEAN IT."
268,00:18:43.20,00:18:43.20,>> I THINK IT'S REALLY TELLING HOW FAST AND HOW ALMOST
269,00:18:47.07,00:18:47.07,DESPERATELY REXIS CAME UP TO US. NOW THAT WE SEE BEAUTY IS
270,00:18:50.30,00:18:50.30,"FRACTURING A LITTLE BIT, IT PUTS THE BRAIN IN A MUCH BETTER"
271,00:18:52.73,00:18:52.73,POSITION. THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THIS
272,00:18:54.80,00:18:54.80,DIVIDED SHOWS THAT WE CAN PLAY THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER.
273,00:18:56.97,00:18:56.97,>> ORIGINALLY JEREMIAH WAS WITH US AND HE FLIPPED AND THEN
274,00:19:00.77,00:19:00.77,FLIPPED BACK AND MORGAN LIES ALL THE TIME.
275,00:19:05.50,00:19:05.50,THE ENTIRE GAME HE'S NEVER GONE TO THE WATER WELL.
276,00:19:11.70,00:19:11.70,I THINK... >> THE BEAUTY TRIBE IS A VERY
277,00:19:14.43,00:19:14.43,GOSSIPY TRIBE. THEY'RE ALMOST HIKE HIGH
278,00:19:16.93,00:19:16.93,"SCHOOLERS. THEY TALK BAD ABOUT EACH OTHER,"
279,00:19:19.07,00:19:19.07,SPREAD RUMORS. SOMETIMES RIGHT IN FRONT OF EACH
280,00:19:21.60,00:19:21.60,OTHER. >> L.J. AND HER LIKE CUDDLE
281,00:19:24.50,00:19:24.50,TOGETHER EVERY NIGHT AND HE'LL ALWAYS ASK HER TO SHAKE HER
282,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,BUTT. >> BOOTY SHAKING.
283,00:19:30.43,00:19:30.43,>> YEAH. SHE PRIDES HERSELF ON BEING ABLE
284,00:19:33.90,00:19:33.90,TO TWERK REALLY WELL. >> THEY JUST SEEM TO HAVE SO
285,00:19:39.20,00:19:39.20,LITTLE SOCIAL SKILLS FOR A TRIBE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL
286,00:19:42.90,00:19:42.90,AND SOCIAL. >> RIGHT NOW MY GUESS IS MORGAN
287,00:19:46.53,00:19:46.53,WOULD BACKSTAB ME IN A HEARTBEAT.
288,00:19:48.63,00:19:48.63,>> ARE YOUR FRIENDS WITH ALEXIS. >> WE WERE WHEN WE FIRST
289,00:19:52.33,00:19:52.33,STARTED. AND HER AND L.J. WERE LIKE THIS.
290,00:19:56.53,00:19:56.53,"SO I'M ON THE OUTS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?"
291,00:19:58.83,00:19:58.83,I'LL GO WITH YOU ALL. I'LL BE A FOURSOME.
292,00:20:01.37,00:20:01.37,>> AS OF NOW THE BRAIN TRIBE IS IN THE BEST POSITION POSSIBLE.
293,00:20:05.53,00:20:05.53,INITIALLY I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BATTLE WITH THE
294,00:20:09.07,00:20:09.07,"BEAUTIES, BUT THERE'S SOME DISSENSION AMONGST THE BEAUTY"
295,00:20:12.57,00:20:12.57,RANKS. SO WE WENT FROM TRAGEDY TO WHAT
296,00:20:17.93,00:20:17.93,SEEMS TO BE A TRIUMPH. JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE OUT
297,00:20:22.10,00:20:22.10,"OF THE GAME, THINGS SWITCH UP AND YOU'RE BACK ON TOP."
298,00:20:28.10,00:20:28.10,">> THE NIGHT OF THAT HUGE STORM, DID YOU ALL GET COLD?"
299,00:20:31.07,00:20:31.07,"IT WAS FREEZING, RIGHT? >> I COULDN'T FEEL MY HANDS."
300,00:20:33.80,00:20:33.80,>> ME NEITHER. I COULD NOT FEEL MY TOES FOR
301,00:20:37.43,00:20:37.43,LIKE THREE HOURS. I WAS FEELING SO GREAT BEFORE
302,00:20:41.33,00:20:41.33,THE SWITCH. I WAS FEELING SOLID.
303,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,BUT WHEN IT'S JUST L.J. AND I WITH ALL THE BRAWN TRIBE
304,00:20:47.67,00:20:47.67,"BASICALLY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT FEELING."
305,00:20:49.40,00:20:49.40,>> WHAT'S GOING ON? >> L.J. AND I ARE NOT...
306,00:20:55.90,00:20:55.90,>> YOU'LL PICK UP ON THAT. SHE'LL COME ACROSS AS A REALLY
307,00:21:00.77,00:21:00.77,HARD WORKER. BUT SHE'S NOT.
308,00:21:04.23,00:21:04.23,>> WHEN TRISH WAS TELLING ME ALL THE ALLIANCES AND WHERE SHE
309,00:21:07.97,00:21:07.97,"STOOD, IT WAS A LITTLE SHOCKING BECAUSE IT HAPPENED PRETTY FAST,"
310,00:21:10.97,00:21:10.97,"SO I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT MY CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH, BUT"
311,00:21:13.97,00:21:13.97,I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A SPOT FOR L.J. AND I TO SQUEEZE IN.
312,00:21:20.10,00:21:20.10,">> WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF CLIFF, BUT HE CAN'T LOSE THE"
313,00:21:24.07,00:21:24.07,CHALLENGES. >> L.J. SAID YOU WERE REAL
314,00:21:25.80,00:21:25.80,TIGHT. >> I STARTED THIS GAME BEING
315,00:21:27.93,00:21:27.93,"VERY NAIVE, BUT I'M STARTING TO REALIZE THAT I HAVE TO START"
316,00:21:30.83,00:21:30.83,DOING WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET TO THE TOP.
317,00:21:34.83,00:21:34.83,>> GOOD. >> WE'RE GOOD.
318,00:21:36.30,00:21:36.30,>> FROM DAY ONE I FELT LIKE I WAS THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.
319,00:21:41.03,00:21:41.03,THIS TWISTS THE WHOLE THING RIGHT UPSIDE DOWN.
320,00:21:43.00,00:21:43.00,">> HEY, BIG MAN. >> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS."
321,00:22:15.87,00:22:15.87,ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

344,00:23:53.37,00:23:53.37,ALL SIX PEOPLE HAVE TO STAY WITH THE LOG AT ALL TIMES.
345,00:23:57.37,00:23:57.37,NECK AND NECK OUT OF THE GATE. WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT LOG TO
346,00:24:01.00,00:24:01.00,SMASH THROUGH THAT WALL. SOLANA HITS A DEAD END.
347,00:24:05.90,00:24:05.90,"APARRI, IT'S HARDER THAN IT LOOKS, ISN'T IT?"
348,00:24:08.97,00:24:08.97,TOUGHER THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BEMENT YOU GOT TO GET
349,00:24:11.63,00:24:11.63,THAT LOG UP HIGH TO BREAK THROUGH THOSE 2X4s.
350,00:24:16.50,00:24:16.50,SOLANA DOING A LITTLE DAMAGE. THERE YOU GO.
351,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,APARRI STILL WORKING. BUT THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE JUST
352,00:24:22.10,00:24:22.10,HOLDING THAT LOG UP. YOU CAN KICK THROUGH AS LONG AS

358,00:24:44.20,00:24:44.20,FIRST WALL. GOT TO GET THROUGH THE 2X4s.
359,00:24:50.93,00:24:50.93,SOLANA WORKING ON THAT SECOND WALL.
360,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT. THE LOGS ARE HEAVY.
361,00:24:56.67,00:24:56.67,THE WALLS ARE VERY STRONG. SARAH'S THROUGH.
362,00:25:00.33,00:25:00.33,APARRI NOW MOVING ON TO THE SECOND WALL.
