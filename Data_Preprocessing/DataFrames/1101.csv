3,00:00:18.25,00:00:18.25,years old. Hidden deep in the jungle these
4,00:00:21.38,00:00:21.38,ruins are a monument to a once powerful and sophisticated
5,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,"civilization, the Maya. Best-known for their advanced"

11,00:00:52.21,00:00:52.21,"environment, where extreme temperatures, high humidity"
12,00:00:56.04,00:00:56.04,and torrential rainstorms bring even the strongest
13,00:01:00.17,00:01:00.17,to their knees. It is here that a group of
14,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,Americans have already begun the adventure of a lifetime.
15,00:01:07.21,00:01:07.21,"They have been divided into two tribes, hiking to a destination"
16,00:01:11.08,00:01:11.08,unknown with no idea of the surprise that awaits them.

27,00:03:10.17,00:03:10.17,You are standing in the ruins of an ancient Mayan civilization
28,00:03:13.46,00:03:13.46,that is literally thousands of years old.
29,00:03:16.17,00:03:16.17,"For the next 39 days, you will live amongst these ruins like"
30,00:03:20.12,00:03:20.12,the Maya did. Already been divided into two
31,00:03:23.00,00:03:23.00,"tribes. Nakum, wearing yellow."
32,00:03:27.04,00:03:27.04,"In the back, you'll hold that. Yaxha, wearing blue."
33,00:03:32.54,00:03:32.54,All right. You'll both live at separate
34,00:03:35.79,00:03:35.79,camps. Waiting for you at each camp
35,00:03:38.42,00:03:38.42,will be a few items used by the Maya that will help you live
36,00:03:42.33,00:03:42.33,like the Maya did. In addition to the things
37,00:03:45.67,00:03:45.67,"waiting for you at camp, each tribe will have one other tool"
38,00:03:50.25,00:03:50.25,to aid you in this game. Come on out.
39,00:04:05.79,00:04:05.79,( laughter ) ( applause )
40,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00,>> PROBST: I'm sure you guys recognize Bobby Jon and
41,00:04:12.33,00:04:12.33,Stephenie from Survivor: Palau.
42,00:04:14.08,00:04:14.08,Come on down. These are two proven Survivor
43,00:04:21.17,00:04:21.17,players. They've been through this
44,00:04:23.21,00:04:23.21,experience. They know how to make fire.
45,00:04:25.54,00:04:25.54,They know how to source food. They know how to build shelter.
46,00:04:29.21,00:04:29.21,"With Stephenie, you have arguably the strongest woman to"
47,00:04:32.04,00:04:32.04,"ever play this game, and somebody who has proven she will"
48,00:04:35.62,00:04:35.62,"not quit. With Bobby Jon, a strong"
49,00:04:38.04,00:04:38.04,"competitor at challenges and in day-to-day camp living,"
50,00:04:42.29,00:04:42.29,arguably the hardest-working survivor ever.
51,00:04:45.83,00:04:45.83,">> What's up, guys? >> PROBST: Stephenie is a member"
52,00:04:52.12,00:04:52.12,of Yaxha. ( cheering )
53,00:04:54.04,00:04:54.04,">> I'm, like, in love with Stephenie."
54,00:04:56.04,00:04:56.04,"So, when I found out she was on our team."
55,00:04:58.04,00:04:58.04,"I was, like, ""Oh, we're winning. We got Stephenie, like, we're"
56,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,good to go. >> I cried.
57,00:05:05.58,00:05:05.58,I couldn't help but just cry. She is such an inspiration.
58,00:05:10.12,00:05:10.12,>> Like all the girls are crying when they saw Stephenie because
59,00:05:13.08,00:05:13.08,that's their hero. I didn't shed a tear when I saw
60,00:05:15.12,00:05:15.12,"her. I was, like, ""How am I going to"
61,00:05:16.67,00:05:16.67,"win $1 million, now that she's here?"""
62,00:05:19.58,00:05:19.58,>> Bobby Jon is a member of Nakum.
63,00:05:22.21,00:05:22.21,( cheering ) >> We're really happy with Bobby
64,00:05:26.25,00:05:26.25,Jon on our tribe. A man is just stronger than a
65,00:05:29.12,00:05:29.12,"woman is and it makes it easy on the eyes around the tribe, so"
66,00:05:33.08,00:05:33.08,that's always a plus. >> We were just thrilled to have
67,00:05:37.12,00:05:37.12,"Bobby Jon because he's not going to quit for anything, and he's"
68,00:05:41.67,00:05:41.67,not going to disappoint somebody on his tribe.
69,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,">> Bobby Jon is a tough worker supposedly, so I hear."
70,00:05:49.38,00:05:49.38,"I don't know. We'll have to see, but, you"
71,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,"know, kind of a little bit dumb, I guess you'd say."
72,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,>> Let me be perfectly clear about this.
73,00:05:58.12,00:05:58.12,Stephenie and Bobby Jon are full-fledged members of your
74,00:06:01.50,00:06:01.50,tribes. They are players in this game.
75,00:06:04.71,00:06:04.71,You can use their backbone and their experience to further your
76,00:06:08.12,00:06:08.12,"own tribe or, if you think it makes more sense, they're"
77,00:06:11.79,00:06:11.79,certainly an easy first vote off the first time you go to Tribal
78,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,Council. All right.
79,00:06:15.75,00:06:15.75,Let's get to your first challenge.
80,00:06:18.33,00:06:18.33,It is for reward. It is a grueling 11-mile race
81,00:06:26.04,00:06:26.04,through the jungles of Guatemala.
82,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: It is going to be"
83,00:06:30.12,00:06:30.12,long. It is going to be hot.
84,00:06:34.12,00:06:34.12,There are poisonous snakes at every corner.
85,00:06:36.92,00:06:36.92,There are crocodiles in every body of water out here.
86,00:06:40.04,00:06:40.04,The trek finishes at the better of the two camps.
87,00:06:44.21,00:06:44.21,"The winning tribe claims the right to the better camp, which"
88,00:06:47.54,00:06:47.54,is also a natural Maya ruin. They also get flint to make
89,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,"fire, critical in this game, right, Steph?"
90,00:06:54.29,00:06:54.29,">> Right. >> PROBST: Losers, you get the"
91,00:06:57.42,00:06:57.42,lesser of the two camps. You get no flint.
92,00:07:00.04,00:07:00.04,You got no fire. You're off to a real rough
93,00:07:03.12,00:07:03.12,start. Big stakes right away.
94,00:07:05.58,00:07:05.58,"Pace yourself. This is a marathon, not a"
95,00:07:08.50,00:07:08.50,sprint. You'll know you're near the
96,00:07:10.96,00:07:10.96,finish when you see your tribe canoes.
97,00:07:13.12,00:07:13.12,"Yaxha you will head up these steps, around the path to the"
98,00:07:16.08,00:07:16.08,"right. Nakum, you will head up these"
99,00:07:18.88,00:07:18.88,"steps, follow the path to the left."
100,00:07:22.00,00:07:22.00,Waiting for you is a compass and a map.
101,00:07:24.92,00:07:24.92,"You'll also find water, fruit, bags of corn."
102,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,It is up to you to decide how much you want to carry with you.
103,00:07:33.00,00:07:33.00,I'll be waiting for you at the finish.
104,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,Survivor: Guatemala is set to begin.
105,00:07:37.12,00:07:37.12,Survivors ready. Go!
106,00:07:51.33,00:07:51.33,">> When we first saw all the fruit, all the water, we had to"
107,00:07:56.58,00:07:56.58,decide what stuff we were gonna carry with us.
108,00:07:59.17,00:07:59.17,It was kind of a little bit of mass chaos.
109,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,>> Grab the bananas. >> Somebody bust something open
110,00:08:04.58,00:08:04.58,and let's eat it while we're here.
111,00:08:06.58,00:08:06.58,">> None of us have ever talked before, so to figure out a"
112,00:08:10.04,00:08:10.04,strategy on the spur of the moment was a little tough.
113,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,>> Take a thing of corn. >> I say we just go ahead and
114,00:08:16.46,00:08:16.46,"start going, guys. >> Let's go, guys."
115,00:08:18.79,00:08:18.79,">> Being a farmer and everything, the last time I"
116,00:08:22.42,00:08:22.42,"hiked 11 miles was never, but, uh, I took off after 'em, you"
117,00:08:27.58,00:08:27.58,"know-- yeehaw! You know, ready to do this, man."
118,00:08:32.38,00:08:32.38,">> Oh, yeah. Feels good. >> We'll get over there, man."
119,00:08:35.71,00:08:35.71,"Just lay down, relax. >> Yup."
120,00:08:37.58,00:08:37.58,">> Just hang out, sing some songs."
121,00:08:39.21,00:08:39.21,"Being back in Survivor, I was glad to get a new start."
122,00:08:42.21,00:08:42.21,I felt like a million bucks at the beginning of the race.
123,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,"But we've got to make time because I guarantee you, Miss"
124,00:08:48.04,00:08:48.04,"Stephenie is over there running things, and she won't, she won't"
125,00:08:50.04,00:08:50.04,"take time. You drop it, you leave it, you"
126,00:08:51.79,00:08:51.79,go. >> So one person in the water.
127,00:08:54.12,00:08:54.12,"( overlapping voices ) >> No, I'm all right."
128,00:08:56.46,00:08:56.46,>> All right. >> My main fear coming into the
129,00:09:00.12,00:09:00.12,"game was that, yes, I may be sort of like a tool 'cause I-I"
130,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,have experience and I kind of came in almost like an outsider.
131,00:09:07.38,00:09:07.38,But Yaxha welcomed me with open arms.
132,00:09:09.92,00:09:09.92,">> Stephenie, you're the reason why I'm here."
133,00:09:11.75,00:09:11.75,">> Oh, stop it. >> Totally awesome."
134,00:09:14.08,00:09:14.08,>> But I still have that nervousness that maybe they will
135,00:09:16.96,00:09:16.96,see me as too threatening or maybe I'm not as spectacular as
136,00:09:19.79,00:09:19.79,they thought I would have been. And maybe they do want to just
137,00:09:22.75,00:09:22.75,get rid of me. >> Let's roll.
138,00:09:24.17,00:09:24.17,>> Let's go. >> How do you pronounce our
139,00:09:26.75,00:09:26.75,tribe? >> Yasha.
140,00:09:29.04,00:09:29.04,>> Yasha. >> Yasha.
141,00:09:41.08,00:09:41.08,"( howling ) >> ""Use your compass to walk a"
142,00:09:45.42,00:09:45.42,"straight line until you hit the old archeological road."""
143,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,">> One and a quarter mile. >> Oh, man."
144,00:09:52.00,00:09:52.00,>> We're gonna have a leader? >> Why don't we leapfrog?
145,00:09:54.88,00:09:54.88,"Go right for that big, tallest tree right to your left, uh,"
146,00:09:58.08,00:09:58.08,Blake... >> Might need to come this way.
147,00:10:01.17,00:10:01.17,">> Come to your right, Blake. >> What?"
148,00:10:04.12,00:10:04.12,">> Come to your right. The jungle, you know, you"
149,00:10:06.42,00:10:06.42,can't move ten feet straight ahead.
150,00:10:08.83,00:10:08.83,"So, I put one of my tribesmen ahead."
151,00:10:11.08,00:10:11.08,I'd have him walk up to a point on my compass.
152,00:10:13.25,00:10:13.25,"And then we all walked to him, and it was slow going."
153,00:10:17.12,00:10:17.12,"Can we see him, anybody? >> Um..."
154,00:10:18.71,00:10:18.71,">> No. >> Oh, I see him, I see him."
155,00:10:20.29,00:10:20.29,"Okay. All right, stay right there."
156,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,Most of the people couldn't read a compass.
157,00:10:24.25,00:10:24.25,"I've done it before, you know, in the Marine Corps, but you can"
158,00:10:26.92,00:10:26.92,walk in circles in that stuff if you don't do it right.
159,00:10:28.92,00:10:28.92,>> Is everybody here? >> Yeah.
160,00:10:30.92,00:10:30.92,>> It's going to get too thick to do this.
161,00:10:32.92,00:10:32.92,">> Well, it's gonna get too dark to do it, is what's gonna"
162,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,happen. >> Yeah.
163,00:10:44.42,00:10:44.42,">> Okay, weave to your left. >> Right here?"
164,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,>> Yup. >> To the large mound?
165,00:10:48.42,00:10:48.42,">> Check it out. >> ""Travel left past the large"
166,00:10:51.42,00:10:51.42,"mounds."" >> Hey, uh, Gary, you going the"
167,00:10:53.67,00:10:53.67,"right way? >> Yeah, you're right."
168,00:10:55.04,00:10:55.04,>> That way. We go left. >> Go right around 'em.
169,00:10:57.29,00:10:57.29,">> No question, straight south. Go."
170,00:10:59.46,00:10:59.46,">> On Survivor, the leader always gets friggin' voted out"
171,00:11:02.75,00:11:02.75,first if someone steps up and takes leadership.
172,00:11:06.33,00:11:06.33,And it was clear at the beginning that Gary was our
173,00:11:09.12,00:11:09.12,leader. He's taller than everyone.
174,00:11:11.62,00:11:11.62,"He's gray-haired. He was our leader, no question."
175,00:11:14.67,00:11:14.67,">> West through... >> No, we need to turn right"
176,00:11:16.46,00:11:16.46,"now, north. >> Gary, what do you do?"
177,00:11:21.12,00:11:21.12,">> All right. >> You know, they've asked me"
178,00:11:23.33,00:11:23.33,"what I do, so I told them I was a landscaper."
179,00:11:26.17,00:11:26.17,"15 years ago, I was in the NFL for 11 years."
180,00:11:29.38,00:11:29.38,"My real name is Gary Hogeboom, but I don't think anybody needs"
181,00:11:33.12,00:11:33.12,"to know that, because I'd be voted off immediately."
182,00:11:35.75,00:11:35.75,I don't see any markers. What do you think?
183,00:11:38.12,00:11:38.12,"If somebody does recognize me, I'm just gonna say that's not"
184,00:11:41.54,00:11:41.54,me. I'm Gary Hawkins.
185,00:11:45.21,00:11:45.21,">> Let's go, guys. >> We're going... we're going"
186,00:11:48.00,00:11:48.00,"north. >> Gary and I, very early on, we"
187,00:11:50.21,00:11:50.21,"both took a compass and we were the navigators, basically."
188,00:11:52.88,00:11:52.88,Make sure we're going the right way.
189,00:11:55.33,00:11:55.33,"It's hard in an 11-and-a-half mile hike to not get lost or,"

191,00:12:02.21,00:12:02.21,We going the right way? >> What's the compass say?
192,00:12:07.00,00:12:07.00,">> Well, this is... this is where we thought we were just"
193,00:12:09.62,00:12:09.62,right now? >> Yep.
194,00:12:11.50,00:12:11.50,>> I think that's leading us to nowhere.
195,00:12:13.54,00:12:13.54,">> Well, that's not so good. >> We made some bad decisions,"
196,00:12:16.08,00:12:16.08,"and, uh, I was the one with the compass."
197,00:12:18.75,00:12:18.75,"But, uh, oh, my gosh, you know, how many young people we got"
198,00:12:21.08,00:12:21.08,"there? Morgan, Brianna, Steph, Jamie,"
199,00:12:25.58,00:12:25.58,"Brian. They're, you know, what are"
200,00:12:27.46,00:12:27.46,"they, 21, 22? I don't want to be a leader, but"
201,00:12:30.42,00:12:30.42,my paternal instincts will kick in with these kids.
202,00:12:33.54,00:12:33.54,Keep up those spirits. >> Watch out.
203,00:12:40.79,00:12:40.79,It's very thorny. Watch where you step.
204,00:12:43.88,00:12:43.88,( yells ) >> Got it there?
205,00:12:46.67,00:12:46.67,>> I'm stuck. >> Watch out for this tree.
206,00:12:50.00,00:12:50.00,">> Here I come, baby, coming full force at you."
207,00:12:53.46,00:12:53.46,11 miles in a jungle is absolutely insane.
208,00:12:57.25,00:12:57.25,"I mean, you're just sitting there fighting things coming"
209,00:13:00.21,00:13:00.21,"down, and just getting to where you want to go, and just..."
210,00:13:02.46,00:13:02.46,"It was, by far, one of the toughest things I've ever"
211,00:13:05.71,00:13:05.71,done in my life. I'm just a freaking doorman
212,00:13:08.38,00:13:08.38,"from New York, man. I never even went camping."
213,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,">> I hope this is over really soon, because... it's getting"
214,00:13:15.00,00:13:15.00,"dark awfully fast. Bobby Jon, right past that."
215,00:13:18.54,00:13:18.54,"Look at, look at that... tall... >> Yeah."
216,00:13:20.83,00:13:20.83,>> See that? >> Got it.
217,00:13:22.42,00:13:22.42,">> Go down, go right down there. >> Got it."
218,00:13:24.83,00:13:24.83,>> Okay. >> Even if we're off a little
219,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83,"bit. >> Stay a little to the left,"
220,00:13:29.54,00:13:29.54,Bobby Jon. ( yelling )
221,00:13:32.08,00:13:32.08,>> Oh! >> That's got thorns in it.
222,00:13:34.25,00:13:34.25,">> Oh, no. >> Great."
223,00:13:36.21,00:13:36.21,>> ...in the shoulders... >> We're going through the
224,00:13:40.25,00:13:40.25,"jungle, and one of these trees that have briers that look like"
225,00:13:44.58,00:13:44.58,"spikes, actually broke on Blake's shoulder."
226,00:13:48.17,00:13:48.17,">> The branch, I mean, it didn't even, like, deflect."
227,00:13:50.08,00:13:50.08,Like it cracked over my shoulder.
228,00:13:52.04,00:13:52.04,God. >> A porcupine tree.
229,00:13:53.58,00:13:53.58,>> Whoa. >> I think it was just one of
230,00:13:56.04,00:13:56.04,"those reality checks that, you know, a scorpion could sting"
231,00:13:59.00,00:13:59.00,"you, a snake could bite you. It's any one of us."
232,00:14:02.21,00:14:02.21,">> I've got two in here. >> All right, get after her,"
233,00:14:05.50,00:14:05.50,girl. >> Hold on.
234,00:14:07.25,00:14:07.25,I'm a nurse by trade. I've been a nurse for 25
235,00:14:10.71,00:14:10.71,"years, most of it trauma. Does that hurt?"
236,00:14:13.54,00:14:13.54,">> Mm-hmm. >> Okay, it's out."
237,00:14:15.38,00:14:15.38,That really took him down a couple notches.
238,00:14:19.17,00:14:19.17,Do you feel any more? >> No. I don't.
239,00:14:20.96,00:14:20.96,">> Okay, stand up. >> Watch these trees right here."
240,00:14:23.38,00:14:23.38,Trees right there... >> Hold up just a second.
241,00:14:25.79,00:14:25.79,>> Let us know when you're ready.
242,00:14:27.33,00:14:27.33,>> Porcupine tree. >> Whoa.
243,00:14:38.33,00:14:38.33,( sighs ) >> We're going the right
244,00:14:40.96,00:14:40.96,direction. We've just got to try to speed
245,00:14:43.17,00:14:43.17,"it up. Catch up, anyway."
246,00:14:50.25,00:14:50.25,>> This is all trees. It's so dark.
247,00:14:58.12,00:14:58.12,">> Guys, wait. Wait, please. >> You want to stop?"
248,00:15:02.62,00:15:02.62,>> What's right here? >> It's kind of a clearing right
249,00:15:04.96,00:15:04.96,here. >> Right here.
250,00:15:06.50,00:15:06.50,"Pick a spot right here. >> Yeah, yeah, we should stop."
251,00:15:08.38,00:15:08.38,>> We really didn't want to stop.
252,00:15:10.54,00:15:10.54,"You know, it just got so dark and we are in thick jungle."
253,00:15:13.04,00:15:13.04,>> Don't cut yourself when you go down on the ground with your
254,00:15:16.12,00:15:16.12,hand. >> Nakum is probably right in
255,00:15:19.42,00:15:19.42,front of us. We'll get up as soon as the sun
256,00:15:22.67,00:15:22.67,"starts to rise, and we will hopefully pull ahead."
257,00:15:25.79,00:15:25.79,"I mean, this... I'm not starting off..."
258,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,"in Guatemala on the losing team, terrible."
259,00:15:35.54,00:15:35.54,( howling ) ( retching )
260,00:15:42.67,00:15:42.67,>> Yeah. Let me just catch my breath.
261,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,>> Okay. >> You know what?
262,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,Why don't we get some palm fronds to put down so he can lay
263,00:15:49.21,00:15:49.21,down? >> Got my shoulder knocked real
264,00:15:52.04,00:15:52.04,"good back there, and it's just slowing me down."
265,00:15:54.75,00:15:54.75,"The thorns went deep inside, and... I think I'm a little"
266,00:15:58.17,00:15:58.17,"dehydrated, my body... my hand is a little"
267,00:16:00.58,00:16:00.58,tingly and... I'll be all right.
268,00:16:02.42,00:16:02.42,( retching ) >> Yeah.
269,00:16:10.08,00:16:10.08,">> Okay. >> Oh, son of a bitch."
270,00:16:12.38,00:16:12.38,">> Blake, we're really worried about him."
271,00:16:14.38,00:16:14.38,"The problem is his shoulder hurt so badly, I think it's causing a"
272,00:16:17.62,00:16:17.62,pain response to make him sick to his stomach.
273,00:16:21.08,00:16:21.08,">> Thanks, Margaret, I appreciate it."
274,00:16:23.67,00:16:23.67,>> We're hoping that he'll feel better in the morning.
275,00:16:27.29,00:16:27.29,( retching ) ( howling )
276,00:16:45.38,00:16:45.38,">> As soon as the sun came up, we started hearing some noises."
277,00:16:48.42,00:16:48.42,It reminded me of Predator. ( howling )
278,00:16:51.08,00:16:51.08,"I looked up, I saw a monkey going from tree to tree."
279,00:16:54.29,00:16:54.29,"And I'm, like, ""Oh, my God. I can't believe this."""
280,00:16:57.33,00:16:57.33,"( howling continues ) >> Hey, guys, if we want to beat"
281,00:17:00.79,00:17:00.79,"Nakum, I think we should start getting up and going."
282,00:17:04.00,00:17:04.00,">> In ten minutes, it'll be better."
283,00:17:06.12,00:17:06.12,">> Well, in ten minutes, they might be going, and they're"
284,00:17:09.46,00:17:09.46,already ahead of us. I wanted to get a move on
285,00:17:12.21,00:17:12.21,because I knew that Nakum would start at daybreak.
286,00:17:15.62,00:17:15.62,"People were a little cranky, but they knew that I was right and"
287,00:17:19.12,00:17:19.12,we did need to go. >> Let's go.
288,00:17:35.42,00:17:35.42,">> We actually found the other tribe, Nakum, which was great,"
289,00:17:39.04,00:17:39.04,"because we were... last we knew, we were hours behind them."
290,00:17:42.75,00:17:42.75,">> Yaxha, come on. >> Let's go, guys."
291,00:17:45.04,00:17:45.04,"We got to move. >> Come on, guys."
292,00:17:47.00,00:17:47.00,>> Meeting up in the jungle with the other tribe took quite a bit
293,00:17:50.92,00:17:50.92,of air out of our balloon. >> The other team's on our back.
294,00:17:54.42,00:17:54.42,">> Let's go. >> Hey, we got road!"
295,00:17:58.75,00:17:58.75,">> Yeah, baby! >> Everybody coming?"
296,00:18:07.25,00:18:07.25,We came out of the jungle into a more open trail before
297,00:18:10.83,00:18:10.83,"the other tribe, but they were still right behind us."
298,00:18:14.25,00:18:14.25,">> Come on, Yaxha! >> We cannot lose this entire"
299,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,tribe. >> We-We just wanted to get them
300,00:18:19.50,00:18:19.50,"off our tails. >> Come on, pick it up."
301,00:18:21.96,00:18:21.96,They're behind us. It was like the movie Sea
302,00:18:25.88,00:18:25.88,"Biscuit, when he sees his competition and he kicks it in."
303,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,I was just like... I felt like I couldn't put one
304,00:18:31.21,00:18:31.21,foot in front of me and all of a sudden I'm running down this
305,00:18:34.42,00:18:34.42,trail in the muck. >> We need to get right on their
306,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,"ass, if not pass them. >> Yeah. Come on, guys."
307,00:18:40.58,00:18:40.58,Push it. We had Nakum.
308,00:18:43.83,00:18:43.83,"They were right in front of us, and then, all of a sudden, a"
309,00:18:46.50,00:18:46.50,"couple people, unfortunately, on our tribe-- like Lydia and Amy,"
310,00:18:49.38,00:18:49.38,who aren't as fit-- they were kind of like lagging behind.
311,00:18:52.21,00:18:52.21,And it's a challenge that you're only as strong as your
312,00:18:54.58,00:18:54.58,weakest link and we had to wait for everybody till we could move
313,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,on. And we had them.
314,00:18:58.96,00:18:58.96,"They were right in front of us, and we lost them completely."
315,00:19:02.04,00:19:02.04,>> You want me to take that flag?
316,00:19:03.83,00:19:03.83,All right. Ready? We're gonna do a slow jog
317,00:19:05.58,00:19:05.58,together. Ready?
318,00:19:06.88,00:19:06.88,">> Yeah. >> Let's go, Nakum."
319,00:19:19.00,00:19:19.00,">> Come on, Bobby Jon. >> All of a sudden, I just got"
320,00:19:24.29,00:19:24.29,"cold as ice and my body severely, severely cramped."
321,00:19:28.21,00:19:28.21,>> My hand's cramping. >> Okay.
322,00:19:30.25,00:19:30.25,">> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. >> Okay, it's okay."
323,00:19:32.12,00:19:32.12,">> Get some water, please. >> All right now."
324,00:19:35.79,00:19:35.79,>> Bobby Jon started getting really bad cramps.
325,00:19:38.96,00:19:38.96,"It's dehydration, overexertion. He carried two bags of corn the"
326,00:19:42.00,00:19:42.00,"entire trek. So, here comes Margaret the"
327,00:19:45.12,00:19:45.12,"nurse lady, and she just talked him through it."
328,00:19:47.25,00:19:47.25,">> All right, I'm-I'm good. >> Keep this leg..."
329,00:19:49.67,00:19:49.67,"Bend this leg up first. >> Here you go, Bobby."
330,00:19:51.67,00:19:51.67,Okay. >> I have to try. Let's go.
331,00:19:53.54,00:19:53.54,>> Okay. >> I think people were
332,00:19:55.08,00:19:55.08,"surprised, because this guy's in better shape probably for this"
333,00:19:58.21,00:19:58.21,and knows what to expect more than anybody and he's going down
334,00:20:00.54,00:20:00.54,early. I don't think anybody expected
335,00:20:03.33,00:20:03.33,that. >> Okay?
336,00:20:08.21,00:20:08.21,">> Can we move faster, guys? Can we move faster?"
337,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,>> Yup. >> All right.
338,00:20:14.25,00:20:14.25,">> How is everyone feeling? >> You guys, everybody doing"
339,00:20:16.12,00:20:16.12,okay? >> Everybody good?
340,00:20:17.58,00:20:17.58,>> Yep. >> Because we have a chance to
341,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,catch up with 'em. >> Okay. Good job.
342,00:20:31.33,00:20:31.33,">> Hey, do I see water? >> Guys, we're almost there."
343,00:20:38.29,00:20:38.29,">> Ow! Ow! >> When I saw the boats, by that"
344,00:20:44.38,00:20:44.38,"time I was just absolutely winded, but I knew that's the"
345,00:20:47.17,00:20:47.17,light at the end of the tunnel. Here we go.
346,00:20:50.96,00:20:50.96,">> ""Paddle your canoe west- southwest to the first wooden"

349,00:20:58.29,00:20:58.29,">> All right, let's go, guys. >> Everybody in, pile in."
350,00:21:01.12,00:21:01.12,"When the other team shows up, it's gonna be a race to the"

352,00:21:15.17,00:21:15.17,Get it together. >> Here they are.
353,00:21:17.79,00:21:17.79,">> There they are. >> Guys, we have to pick it up."
354,00:21:21.17,00:21:21.17,Just stay hard. Slow but hard.
355,00:21:23.92,00:21:23.92,"( shouting ) >> Emerging from the jungle, we"
356,00:21:26.42,00:21:26.42,see Nakum right there in the middle of the lake.
357,00:21:29.71,00:21:29.71,We were so much closer than we thought we were.
358,00:21:32.12,00:21:32.12,And we just booked it to our canoe.
359,00:21:34.46,00:21:34.46,We knew we had caught up. It was a huge morale booster.
360,00:21:37.38,00:21:37.38,">> Stroke. >> Come on, guys."
361,00:21:39.58,00:21:39.58,>> Stroke. >> I think we need to get in a

367,00:22:14.25,00:22:14.25,Judd jumps out of the boat. He had a premature evacuation.
368,00:22:19.04,00:22:19.04,And he gets into this mud that's almost like quicksand.
369,00:22:22.33,00:22:22.33,">> It's hard to get out of, man. ( indistinct voices )"
370,00:22:28.21,00:22:28.21,>> Stroke. Keep paddling. Don't stop.

377,00:22:48.75,00:22:48.75,Getting out of the boat was a nightmare.

379,00:22:56.58,00:22:56.58,pain before. I knew the other tribe was
380,00:22:59.04,00:22:59.04,"definitely on our tail, so it's kind of like you got to suck it"
381,00:23:02.08,00:23:02.08,up. But it was just tough.
382,00:23:05.54,00:23:05.54,>> They're right there. Everyone give it.
383,00:23:15.71,00:23:15.71,">> Oh, yeah! >> Yeah!"
384,00:23:19.79,00:23:19.79,"( whooping ) >> PROBST: Welcome, Nakum."
385,00:23:25.58,00:23:25.58,( cheering ) Congratulations.
386,00:23:32.42,00:23:32.42,">> Nakum! >> PROBST: Nicely done, guys."
387,00:23:36.04,00:23:36.04,"( groaning ) >> PROBST: So, 11 miles, 24-hour"
388,00:23:50.54,00:23:50.54,"trek, you guys definitely earned the better of the two camps."
389,00:23:55.08,00:23:55.08,"Here is your tribe flag. More important, who wants it?"
390,00:24:00.92,00:24:00.92,"Margaret, flint. >> Thanks."
391,00:24:02.50,00:24:02.50,>> PROBST: Take care of that. Congratulations.
392,00:24:05.46,00:24:05.46,Good luck. >> Awesome.
393,00:24:13.71,00:24:13.71,Still got some spring in those steps.
394,00:24:16.04,00:24:16.04,">> Nice job there, guys. Nice job, nice job."
395,00:24:18.29,00:24:18.29,">> PROBST: Don't get too comfortable, you're not staying."
396,00:24:21.83,00:24:21.83,"This is not your camp. I think it's fair to say, given"
397,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,"that this was an 11-mile trek through the jungle, a very close"
398,00:24:29.21,00:24:29.21,"finish, but in Survivor, close gets you nothing."
399,00:24:32.25,00:24:32.25,This is where you will not be living.
400,00:24:35.04,00:24:35.04,This is a map to where you will be living.
401,00:24:38.33,00:24:38.33,"Who wants it? Okay, you've got more paddling"
402,00:24:41.04,00:24:41.04,to do. Here's your tribe flag.
403,00:24:43.21,00:24:43.21,"All right, guys. Take your stuff and go."
404,00:24:45.50,00:24:45.50,">> Bye, guys. >> Bye."
405,00:24:47.62,00:24:47.62,>> Bye. >> See you later.
406,00:24:50.21,00:24:50.21,">> You know, we lost, but we... I thought we kicked butt."
407,00:24:53.21,00:24:53.21,I thought we did really well. I think it was the most
408,00:24:56.17,00:24:56.17,difficult challenge the game's ever had.
409,00:25:22.21,00:25:22.21,">> So we leave the ruins, we leave the winners, and we're"
410,00:25:25.12,00:25:25.12,"bummed, because, you know, it's taken us 24 hours to get there"
411,00:25:28.96,00:25:28.96,and we worked really hard. >> So we've got to go down
412,00:25:31.46,00:25:31.46,"there, you guys? >> Yes."
413,00:25:33.12,00:25:33.12,">> It kind of stunk for us, because, you know, we get all"
414,00:25:35.71,00:25:35.71,"the way there, we lose, so we had to paddle all the way across"
415,00:25:38.67,00:25:38.67,the lake to get to our camp. So it was a lot of extra work.
416,00:25:41.38,00:25:41.38,>> You want to check out where the camp is before we carry all
417,00:25:44.04,00:25:44.04,this crap? >> We're just gonna leave it on
418,00:25:46.29,00:25:46.29,the dock. Let's just unload as much as
419,00:25:48.25,00:25:48.25,"we can. >> Come on, Yaxha, I know we're"
420,00:25:50.12,00:25:50.12,"tired. >> Let's go, you guys."
421,00:25:51.83,00:25:51.83,>> All right. >> When we started walking up to
422,00:25:54.21,00:25:54.21,"our camp, we didn't know what to expect."
423,00:25:56.25,00:25:56.25,">> I see it, you guys. >> Our home."
424,00:25:58.21,00:25:58.21,">> Whoa, what's up with the pots?"
425,00:26:00.29,00:26:00.29,>> That's for the corn. >> That's a perfect one to cook
426,00:26:03.46,00:26:03.46,tortillas. >> We finally got to camp.
427,00:26:05.92,00:26:05.92,"It sucks we don't have water, but we're making do."
428,00:26:08.46,00:26:08.46,">> So, maybe we should talk about shelter and where we want"
429,00:26:11.58,00:26:11.58,to build it and how we want to build it.
430,00:26:14.12,00:26:14.12,">> Okay. >> Yeah, this isn't bad."
431,00:26:17.54,00:26:17.54,>> Let's go. >> Making a lean-to'd be
432,00:26:20.25,00:26:20.25,"awesome, 'cause you know, water runs off."
433,00:26:22.08,00:26:22.08,">> Okay. >> Yeah, actually this is an"
434,00:26:24.17,00:26:24.17,"incline, guys. >> I'm just gonna shove 'em"
435,00:26:26.17,00:26:26.17,through. You just got to pull them
436,00:26:28.58,00:26:28.58,where you can. >> I'll build you your dream
437,00:26:31.17,00:26:31.17,home. >> I am so psyched.
438,00:26:34.21,00:26:34.21,Finally I'm on a tribe that's got as much heart and
439,00:26:37.21,00:26:37.21,"determination as me. >> Yeah, see how good that is?"
440,00:26:40.21,00:26:40.21,>> Good job. You got it. It's under.
441,00:26:44.04,00:26:44.04,">> Yes. >> We were dead tired, but all"
442,00:26:46.25,00:26:46.25,"we had left was, you know, this Yaxha spirit, like, ""We can do"
443,00:26:49.29,00:26:49.29,this and we don't care if we're coming in second.
444,00:26:51.79,00:26:51.79,"We're giving it everything we have."""
445,00:26:54.12,00:26:54.12,">> That's going to be good, I think."
446,00:27:00.42,00:27:00.42,"( retching ) >> How you doing, Blake?"
447,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,( panting ) ( retching )
448,00:27:07.75,00:27:07.75,">> Breathe through your nose, Blake."
449,00:27:10.75,00:27:10.75,The combination of going through the jungle and trying to get
450,00:27:13.92,00:27:13.92,here has dehydrated so many of us.
451,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,"( retching ) >> Judd, you okay back there?"
452,00:27:21.00,00:27:21.00,Judd's down. ( groans )
453,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,Blake's down. ( retching )
454,00:27:25.92,00:27:25.92,"Jim's not doing well, and Bobby Jon's down."
455,00:27:29.46,00:27:29.46,They're all vomiting. They're all cramped up.
456,00:27:33.25,00:27:33.25,>> Bobby Jon. Bobby Jon.
457,00:27:35.25,00:27:35.25,">> Huh? >> Oh, his eyes are rolling"
458,00:27:37.00,00:27:37.00,back. Bobby Jon?
459,00:27:39.54,00:27:39.54,"Bobby Jon? Come on, Bobby Jon."
460,00:27:42.08,00:27:42.08,Focus. Slow.
461,00:27:44.12,00:27:44.12,Breathe through your nose. Bobby Jon?
462,00:27:47.08,00:27:47.08,Bobby Jon? Bobby?
463,00:27:49.46,00:27:49.46,Stay with me. Stay with me.
464,00:27:52.17,00:27:52.17,"Yup. Bobby Jon, stay with me."
465,00:27:59.58,00:27:59.58,"Okay, okay. Let's just rub your legs here."
466,00:28:03.17,00:28:03.17,Okay. Just keep them up like that.
467,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,Keep them up like that. Just a little. Little tiny...
468,00:28:07.71,00:28:07.71,">> He'll throw it up, if... >> I started having the shakes,"
469,00:28:10.33,00:28:10.33,just was cramping everywhere that I never knew I could cramp.
470,00:28:13.08,00:28:13.08,"If it wouldn't have been for Margaret, I really felt I might"
471,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,have had a seizure. It was a nightmare.
472,00:28:19.04,00:28:19.04,Palau was recess compared to Guatemala.
473,00:28:22.54,00:28:22.54,( retching ) >> Blake good?
474,00:28:24.67,00:28:24.67,">> We are messed up! >> These big, strong guys,"
475,00:28:29.12,00:28:29.12,"strong as oxes, and they are all down."
476,00:28:31.92,00:28:31.92,( groans ) >> What do we need to do?
477,00:28:34.96,00:28:34.96,>> We need to just make rounds with them and give them water.
478,00:28:38.25,00:28:38.25,That's all we need to do. The girls are holding up
479,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,remarkably well. >> Big enough so you don't get
480,00:28:43.33,00:28:43.33,sick again. >> But we didn't expect the guys
481,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,"to go down so quickly. Don't get up, lay down."
482,00:28:48.88,00:28:48.88,"Stay down, stay down. >> It was a bittersweet victory"
483,00:28:51.88,00:28:51.88,because we won. We got there first.
484,00:28:54.71,00:28:54.71,"We got the fire and the best camp, but some of us were in"
485,00:28:58.04,00:28:58.04,"such bad shape, you're thinking if we lose 'em, it's not even"
486,00:29:01.50,00:29:01.50,"worth having all this. >> Oh, my God, it's an oar."
487,00:29:23.54,00:29:23.54,">> Let's go back, let's go back. >> ""Your first two days were"
488,00:29:27.79,00:29:27.79,"grueling, but now is no time to rest."
489,00:29:30.12,00:29:30.12,You've come too far to lose it now.
490,00:29:32.08,00:29:32.08,This will put you to the test. You'll be competing like the
491,00:29:35.08,00:29:35.08,Maya. This is more than just a game.
492,00:29:38.21,00:29:38.21,"Fail to pull your weight today, and be the first to lose your"
493,00:29:41.58,00:29:41.58,"flame."" >> Okay, here's what I've"
494,00:29:43.92,00:29:43.92,"learned from my thing... Uh, for me, this is really"
495,00:29:46.38,00:29:46.38,exciting to have another chance at immunity and possibly come
496,00:29:49.50,00:29:49.50,out with a victory. Usually the person who steers
497,00:29:52.08,00:29:52.08,"is one of the strongest, 'cause they row both sides and steer."
498,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,"But also it's a lot of pressure, because if we lose this"
499,00:29:58.12,00:29:58.12,challenge I'm going to be really down.
500,00:30:07.96,00:30:07.96,>> Tree mail. >> It says we're going to be
501,00:30:10.96,00:30:10.96,competing like the Maya. >> Definitely our tribe not
502,00:30:13.54,00:30:13.54,being in tip-top shape right now is a concern.
503,00:30:15.96,00:30:15.96,>> We're all staying here tonight.
504,00:30:17.54,00:30:17.54,>> Yeah. >> Nobody is going home.
505,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,>> I think the girls right now are the strongest
506,00:30:21.62,00:30:21.62,"physically, but if our guys go up for this challenge"
507,00:30:24.17,00:30:24.17,and turn it on like no other then we're definitely going to
508,00:30:27.17,00:30:27.17,have a good day today. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get
509,00:30:43.38,00:30:43.38,to your first immunity challenge?
510,00:30:45.25,00:30:45.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Let me show you what
511,00:30:47.38,00:30:47.38,you're playing for. This is it.
512,00:30:50.67,00:30:50.67,( applause ) The game revolves around
513,00:30:55.46,00:30:55.46,immunity. As long as you have it in your
514,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,"possession, whether as a tribe or an individual, you're safe."
515,00:31:01.17,00:31:01.17,"If not, you're in danger of going home."
516,00:31:03.12,00:31:03.12,"Okay, let's get to the challenge."
517,00:31:05.12,00:31:05.12,It is based on the method that the Maya used for transporting
518,00:31:08.38,00:31:08.38,materials to build their pyramids.
519,00:31:10.21,00:31:10.21,"Here's how it works. On my ""go"" all nine of you will"
520,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,"paddle out in a boat, around a buoy, grab a torch, come back."
521,00:31:16.96,00:31:16.96,"Once you reach the shore, you'll drag your boat up the beach and"
522,00:31:20.58,00:31:20.58,"attach it to a rope. At that point, four people will"
523,00:31:23.62,00:31:23.62,race up the hill and begin pulling on that rope.
524,00:31:26.33,00:31:26.33,"As you pull, you'll move the boat over a series of rolling"
525,00:31:29.33,00:31:29.33,logs. This is how the Maya did it.
526,00:31:31.88,00:31:31.88,"Every time you clear a log, four other people will take that back"
527,00:31:35.21,00:31:35.21,log and move it to the front. That'll keep the momentum
528,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,going. That leaves one person left.
529,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,Their sole responsibility is carrying that torch.
530,00:31:42.46,00:31:42.46,Once the boat crosses the finish line the person with the torch
531,00:31:46.08,00:31:46.08,lights the fire. The first tribe to get their
532,00:31:48.42,00:31:48.42,"flame lit wins immunity. For the losers, Tribal Council."
533,00:31:51.79,00:31:51.79,"First person will be voted out. Yaxha, you still need fire."
534,00:31:55.38,00:31:55.38,"Win this challenge, you get your fire."
535,00:31:57.79,00:31:57.79,">> We're going to get it, guys. >> PROBST: Pick your spots."
536,00:32:01.33,00:32:01.33,"Wait for my ""go."" Here we go."
537,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,"For immunity, Survivors ready. Go."
538,00:32:10.04,00:32:10.04,">> Let's go, guys. Let's go. >> Come on, guys."
539,00:32:22.75,00:32:22.75,( indistinct voices ) >> PROBST: Both tribes out
540,00:32:27.46,00:32:27.46,pretty even. >> Come on. Dig.
541,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,">> Come on... >> Come on, you guys."
542,00:32:35.04,00:32:35.04,( shouting ) >> PROBST: Dead-even at the
543,00:32:41.58,00:32:41.58,buoy; Yaxha has their torch. They're making their turn.
544,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,Gonna have a collision. >> Nakum struggling at the
545,00:32:48.67,00:32:48.67,"buoy, trying to get their torch. Yaxha working well."
546,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,Navigates through. Chance to take the lead.
547,00:33:00.04,00:33:00.04,">> Come on, Yaxha. >> Row! Row! Row!"
548,00:33:05.46,00:33:05.46,>> Stroke! ( indistinct shouting )
549,00:33:09.96,00:33:09.96,>> PROBST: Very tight coming back to the beach.
550,00:33:13.42,00:33:13.42,Yaxha getting off their boat. Nakum off their boat.
551,00:33:17.54,00:33:17.54,Going to take strength and working together.
552,00:33:20.25,00:33:20.25,Got to work together. >> Go!
553,00:33:23.04,00:33:23.04,>> PROBST: Nakum has their rope attached.
554,00:33:25.58,00:33:25.58,"Bobby Jon, Brandon, Blake, Judd. >> He's had enough."
555,00:33:29.25,00:33:29.25,">> PROBST: Jim, going to stay back with the women."
556,00:33:32.38,00:33:32.38,"Yaxha right behind with Jamie, Gary, Brian, Rafe."
557,00:33:36.12,00:33:36.12,">> Go, guys! >> Go, go, go."
558,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,">> One, two, three. >> Push."
559,00:33:41.42,00:33:41.42,">> One, two, three. >> One..."
560,00:33:47.96,00:33:47.96,">> One, two... >> Ow!"
561,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,"My foot, my foot is under the log."
562,00:33:53.25,00:33:53.25,">> Stop, go back. >> PROBST: Stephenie's foot is"
563,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,"caught under a log. She's got it free, but now Nakum"
564,00:34:00.79,00:34:00.79,is back ahead. A lot of work pulling this heavy

586,00:35:32.33,00:35:32.33,important right now for you guys-- flint to make fire.
587,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,"For the first time, Steph, there will be a Tribal Council"
588,00:35:38.92,00:35:38.92,in which you've been a part of Survivor that you won't be at.
589,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,"( cheering and whistling ) Nakum, Tribal Council tonight."
590,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,"Sadly, somebody will be the first person voted out."
591,00:35:50.96,00:35:50.96,Head on back. >> Losing the immunity
592,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,challenge today was really tough.
593,00:36:11.12,00:36:11.12,We worked our way up from having four guys who were badly down
594,00:36:15.50,00:36:15.50,yesterday. The heat sapped us.
595,00:36:17.58,00:36:17.58,It was... it was excruciating. >> God...
596,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,>> It popped right when... when we picked the canoe up.
597,00:36:23.54,00:36:23.54,"I thought everybody else was lifting, and I was lifting by"
598,00:36:26.00,00:36:26.00,"myself. It just went ""pop."""
599,00:36:27.58,00:36:27.58,>> Lifted that bad boy up like I never lifted anything before in
600,00:36:30.04,00:36:30.04,"my life. >> Yeah, and so was I."
601,00:36:32.04,00:36:32.04,"We knew this challenge ought to be something brutal, and it"
602,00:36:35.08,00:36:35.08,turned out that it was. My left bicep literally snapped.
603,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,>> Let me get a cloth for it and see if I can put it behind us.
604,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,( groans ) >> I'm really starting to adapt
605,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,to this jungle. Jungle Judd.
606,00:36:50.33,00:36:50.33,"What about you? >> Oh, yeah."
607,00:36:51.96,00:36:51.96,>> You enjoying the jungle life?
608,00:36:53.54,00:36:53.54,">> I'm doing good. Oh, I'm surprised. I felt..."
609,00:36:55.62,00:36:55.62,I felt all right after the 11 miles.
610,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,Since we lost the immunity challenge we know one
611,00:37:00.12,00:37:00.12,of us has to leave and none of us deserves to go.
612,00:37:03.46,00:37:03.46,"I mean, I definitely don't want any of the women to go yet and"
613,00:37:06.67,00:37:06.67,we've really shown that we have the endurance for 40 days.
614,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,"I mean, I feel fine, and we... I mean, all of us were able to"
615,00:37:13.58,00:37:13.58,stick through it really hard yesterday and do a ton of
616,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,work. And Brandon hasn't sat down yet.
617,00:37:18.25,00:37:18.25,">> Yeah. >> So, I don't know."
618,00:37:20.46,00:37:20.46,"I mean, Bobby Jon was the sickest yesterday, by far."
619,00:37:23.42,00:37:23.42,"I mean, his eyes were rolling back in his head."
620,00:37:26.04,00:37:26.04,>> Mm-hmm. >> He was the worst off.
621,00:37:27.79,00:37:27.79,"( howling ) >> I need some of that water,"
622,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,man. >> Here.
623,00:37:36.21,00:37:36.21,"I don't know what's going to happen at Tribal,"
624,00:37:39.42,00:37:39.42,"but we might send off one of these crippled, you know,"
625,00:37:43.12,00:37:43.12,"broke-down guys. I mean, I'm having doubts if"
626,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,half of these people are even going to make it.
627,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,"Blake, he's all crippled up and his shoulder is like killing"
628,00:37:52.25,00:37:52.25,"him. He's kind of, you know, still"
629,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,"throwing up, and he's getting cramps really bad, and he's the"
630,00:37:58.62,00:37:58.62,one I'm most concerned about. >> You got to take a sip.
631,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"You still can dehydrate out here, okay?"
632,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,It has some lemon in it. When there's at least three
633,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,people absolutely flat on their back-- a third of your team is
634,00:38:11.50,00:38:11.50,"out-- you know, strategizing is a little bit tough."
635,00:38:14.75,00:38:14.75,I really like Bobby Jon. I think he's a strong player.
636,00:38:18.62,00:38:18.62,"Jim, he's a great guy. He's got a lot of offer."
637,00:38:22.08,00:38:22.08,"I-I like Blake. In this tribe, they are all"
638,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,"great people, but it's-it's all about who can help carry this"
639,00:38:29.46,00:38:29.46,team forward. >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
640,00:39:06.83,00:39:06.83,a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch
641,00:39:08.75,00:39:08.75,"and approach the flame, because in this game"
642,00:39:11.04,00:39:11.04,"fire represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are"
643,00:39:17.83,00:39:17.83,you. Take a seat.
644,00:39:23.79,00:39:23.79,"Before we get started, we have to acknowledge where we are."
645,00:39:27.08,00:39:27.08,You're in the midst of the North Acropolis.
646,00:39:29.29,00:39:29.29,"These are authentic Maya ruins, and thousands of years ago this"
647,00:39:32.88,00:39:32.88,is a spot where leaders would decide the fate of their people.
648,00:39:36.12,00:39:36.12,Couldn't be a more fitting spot for Tribal Council.
649,00:39:39.04,00:39:39.04,"All right, so let's get to it. This is the toughest beginning"
650,00:39:42.12,00:39:42.12,"to any Survivor we've ever had. Blake, immediately your head"
651,00:39:45.12,00:39:45.12,"just went down like, ""Yeah, I know."""
652,00:39:47.46,00:39:47.46,">> It's been pretty tough, Jeff. That first day, you know, Bobby"
653,00:39:50.58,00:39:50.58,"Jon, myself and Jim and Judd, we were cramping all up and down"
654,00:39:53.38,00:39:53.38,and sick to our stomachs and couldn't keep anything down and
655,00:39:56.29,00:39:56.29,"dehydration, and... it was definitely a hard start"
656,00:39:58.83,00:39:58.83,"to this adventure, for sure. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon, how about"
657,00:40:01.62,00:40:01.62,for you? >> I don't like getting beat
658,00:40:04.17,00:40:04.17,down like that this early in the game.
659,00:40:06.33,00:40:06.33,I've never had that happen to me before.
660,00:40:08.25,00:40:08.25,"I mean, I know I could be saying sayonara tonight."
661,00:40:11.08,00:40:11.08,I hope... I hope to God I don't have to.
662,00:40:13.21,00:40:13.21,"I mean, not many people get two chances to win a million"
663,00:40:15.54,00:40:15.54,"bucks. >> Danni, looking at this group,"
664,00:40:18.50,00:40:18.50,"you've got a lot of young, strong guys."
665,00:40:20.83,00:40:20.83,You had you to be a little surprised to see four of your
666,00:40:24.42,00:40:24.42,"five guys on their back. >> Well, I was a-a little"
667,00:40:27.12,00:40:27.12,"surprised, but I think a lot of times guys have more physical"
668,00:40:30.04,00:40:30.04,"strength, but women tend to have a little more endurance."
669,00:40:32.46,00:40:32.46,"Maybe that played a part of it, but also, they were carrying at"
670,00:40:35.25,00:40:35.25,"the beginning, a lot of the load and so they were throwing up and"
671,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,getting sick and that's going to happen.
672,00:40:40.29,00:40:40.29,"That's just part of the game. >> PROBST: Judd, you come out."
673,00:40:42.46,00:40:42.46,"If I'm looking, I'm thinking, ""All right, I've got to rely on"
674,00:40:45.04,00:40:45.04,"Judd,"" especially through this trek and some of these physical"
675,00:40:47.46,00:40:47.46,challenges and you're on your back.
676,00:40:49.38,00:40:49.38,"You have to be thinking ""Am I in trouble?"""
677,00:40:51.21,00:40:51.21,">> Not at all. I mean, I was... I was only on"
678,00:40:53.21,00:40:53.21,my back for like an hour at the most.
679,00:40:55.38,00:40:55.38,"I mean, I got right over it. I puked and I got up and I went"
680,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,"to do what I had to do, man. I mean, I don't know what to"
681,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,tell you. I'm ready to do a back flip if
682,00:41:02.96,00:41:02.96,"you want me to. I mean, I feel great."
683,00:41:04.67,00:41:04.67,">> PROBST: Wow, I just asked a simple question."
684,00:41:06.88,00:41:06.88,( laughing ) Let's talk about today's
685,00:41:11.25,00:41:11.25,"challenge. Jim, so what is up with your"
686,00:41:13.04,00:41:13.04,arm? 'Cause you've made a
687,00:41:14.50,00:41:14.50,"homemade sling over there. >> Yeah, first thing out of the"
688,00:41:17.33,00:41:17.33,"chute when we picked up the boat, I grabbed it with my left"
689,00:41:19.75,00:41:19.75,arm. And I was under the impression
690,00:41:22.08,00:41:22.08,"everybody else had ahold of it. Sure didn't, and it just tore"
691,00:41:25.08,00:41:25.08,that bicep muscle. >> PROBST: When did you know?
692,00:41:27.12,00:41:27.12,Did you know instantly? >> I knew when I picked it up.
693,00:41:30.21,00:41:30.21,"It popped. I heard it pop. I was 50%, but I'm not blaming"
694,00:41:33.08,00:41:33.08,it on my arm. When you don't have everybody at
695,00:41:35.88,00:41:35.88,"100%, it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt the-the"
696,00:41:38.12,00:41:38.12,"tribe. >> PROBST: Margaret, three days"

699,00:41:45.62,00:41:45.62,"do we need to do in this game?"" >> I mean, all of us are very"
700,00:41:49.21,00:41:49.21,worried about how to pace our team to put us in the winning
701,00:41:52.79,00:41:52.79,position for both the rewards and not to be here at Tribal
702,00:41:56.25,00:41:56.25,"Council, so we are trying to realign our priorities and"

713,00:43:24.62,00:43:24.62,I'll read the votes. First vote...
