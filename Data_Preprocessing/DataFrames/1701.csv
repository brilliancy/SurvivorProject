190,00:11:33.00,00:11:33.00,Keep pushing. >> PROBST: GC and Marcus
191,00:11:36.88,00:11:36.88,"looking out for themselves, going after that individual"
192,00:11:39.50,00:11:39.50,immunity. Big move to make early in the
193,00:11:42.00,00:11:42.00,game. >> Come on.
194,00:11:44.21,00:11:44.21,Keep it going. Keep it going.
195,00:11:46.92,00:11:46.92,(Paloma grunts) >> PROBST: Bob helping out
196,00:11:49.71,00:11:49.71,Paloma for Kota. Ace pushing her.
197,00:11:54.17,00:11:54.17,Marcus first to the top. Marcus has the idol for Kota.
198,00:11:59.08,00:11:59.08,Here comes GC for Fang. Michelle right on his tail.
199,00:12:04.08,00:12:04.08,"The rest of Fang lagging behind. For Fang, GC grabs the idol."
200,00:12:10.92,00:12:10.92,"Michelle, the last woman picked, is the first woman"
201,00:12:14.38,00:12:14.38,across. >> Really don't think the
202,00:12:16.71,00:12:16.71,"Fang tribe really is that smart. I was the last one picked, and"
203,00:12:22.62,00:12:22.62,"I was the first girl up there, so they can kiss my ass."
204,00:12:26.25,00:12:26.25,>> PROBST: Big question now: which tribe gets the food?
205,00:12:30.50,00:12:30.50,">> Oh. >> Come on, girl."
206,00:12:33.79,00:12:33.79,">> Come on, Kota! Let's go!"
207,00:12:36.08,00:12:36.08,"Come on, guys. >> PROBST: Kota with a big"
208,00:12:38.08,00:12:38.08,"lead heading for that food. >> Come on, guys!"
209,00:12:40.04,00:12:40.04,">> Let's go. Let's go. >> PROBST: Susie, Gillian,"
210,00:12:42.79,00:12:42.79,Crystal really struggling for Fang.
211,00:12:45.08,00:12:45.08,This isn't even close. Everybody got to be across
212,00:12:49.38,00:12:49.38,the black line. (Gillian grunts)
213,00:12:53.58,00:12:53.58,(applause) >> We got it.
214,00:12:55.83,00:12:55.83,>> PROBST: Kota wins the extra food!
215,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,Bag of corn and beans. Matty just trying to get his
216,00:13:04.00,00:13:04.00,tribe to the top. >> I think we're screwed in a
217,00:13:06.96,00:13:06.96,lot of physical challenges because Gillian is going to be
218,00:13:09.38,00:13:09.38,"a huge, huge, huge load to carry."
219,00:13:12.58,00:13:12.58,She's a slow-moving human being. >> Sorry.
220,00:13:18.21,00:13:18.21,>> Thank you. >> I know I can run.
221,00:13:20.50,00:13:20.50,But climbing that hill was so hard.
222,00:13:22.88,00:13:22.88,"I had on a dress, and on top of that, my two shoes weigh at"
223,00:13:26.42,00:13:26.42,least ten pounds. >> That's it.
224,00:13:32.25,00:13:32.25,"That's it, Gillian. >> Good job."
225,00:13:34.17,00:13:34.17,"Come on, girl. Almost, you're almost finished."
226,00:13:37.04,00:13:37.04,>> PROBST: Fang finally crosses the finish line.
227,00:13:42.12,00:13:42.12,"All right, so Marcus has the idol for Kota."
228,00:13:45.21,00:13:45.21,GC got the idol for Fang. Kota was the first tribe to get
229,00:13:50.04,00:13:50.04,everybody to the top. You win the extra bag of corn
230,00:13:52.12,00:13:52.12,and beans. (applause)
231,00:13:54.75,00:13:54.75,">> PROBST: I got to say, Fang, if this is any indicator,"
232,00:13:57.67,00:13:57.67,it's going to be a long run for you guys.
233,00:13:59.62,00:13:59.62,"That wasn't even close. All right, Fang, grab your"
234,00:14:02.54,00:14:02.54,"stuff, including the map, to your new tribe home."
235,00:14:07.21,00:14:07.21,"All right, Kota, grab all your stuff, including that very"
236,00:14:10.38,00:14:10.38,important extra bag of food and head out.
237,00:14:43.17,00:14:43.17,(elephant trumpeting) (monkey squawking)
238,00:14:50.83,00:14:50.83,>> Being this far out in nature in the middle of this huge
239,00:14:53.29,00:14:53.29,jungle is definitely an unnerving experience.
240,00:14:56.04,00:14:56.04,(monkey squawking) You don't know what's around
241,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,"the next tree. It's really, really scary."
242,00:15:03.12,00:15:03.12,We emerged from the jungle and we look down and we see the
243,00:15:06.21,00:15:06.21,flag for Kota waving in the breeze.
244,00:15:08.04,00:15:08.04,"There's this beautiful lake, and in front of it are a couple"
245,00:15:10.75,00:15:10.75,of broken-down huts. (applause)
246,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,It was such a joy to see that there was some shelter kind of
247,00:15:16.62,00:15:16.62,established. >> It's crazy.
248,00:15:18.50,00:15:18.50,">> It's a wild, wild place, and you don't want to be out there"
249,00:15:21.08,00:15:21.08,"exposed to animals. I mean, the rest of the tribe"
250,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,could be sitting there and we could be getting eaten by a
251,00:15:24.42,00:15:24.42,leopard and no one would know the difference.
252,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,>> We have the canoe. >> We have a dock.
253,00:15:30.42,00:15:30.42,That's awesome. >> I love it.
254,00:15:34.58,00:15:34.58,I'm excited. This place looks beautiful.
255,00:15:36.71,00:15:36.71,(laughs) But there's really wild animals
256,00:15:38.96,00:15:38.96,out here. (laughs)
257,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,This is really Africa. So I'm not going to get in the
258,00:15:44.92,00:15:44.92,"water right now, and I'm not going to be bathing or swimming"
259,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,in the lake with my tribe mates. (laughs)
260,00:15:54.00,00:15:54.00,">> Hey, we need to work on the roof."
261,00:15:55.62,00:15:55.62,>> It's about to rain. >> I'm feeling sprinkles.
262,00:16:02.62,00:16:02.62,">> Okay, let's pass these out now."
263,00:16:04.21,00:16:04.21,">> We got to layer it up. >> Okay, okay."
264,00:16:08.21,00:16:08.21,>> We're pretty solid. >> Do you need more twine?
265,00:16:10.54,00:16:10.54,">> Just give me a piece, like, a foot long."
266,00:16:14.17,00:16:14.17,">> Ugh, Bob-- he's just like the forever Boy Scout."
267,00:16:17.17,00:16:17.17,">> Go, Bob. Go, Bob."
268,00:16:20.08,00:16:20.08,Let's give him some moral support.
269,00:16:22.04,00:16:22.04,">> Bob, he's totally like, he gets it together."
270,00:16:23.79,00:16:23.79,He's got the camp running really smoothly.
271,00:16:26.12,00:16:26.12,">> Yeah, it's looking really good, man."
272,00:16:28.08,00:16:28.08,">> He's 57 years old, and he's awesome."
273,00:16:30.50,00:16:30.50,">> Good job, guys. (applause)"
274,00:16:33.12,00:16:33.12,>> Whoo! >> I've done a lot of stuff
275,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,"around camp. To me, it's common sense."
276,00:16:39.38,00:16:39.38,"I come from Maine. You know, that's what we do in"
277,00:16:41.46,00:16:41.46,Maine. >> ...exactly together.
278,00:16:43.00,00:16:43.00,>> ...actually use a short piece of something.
279,00:16:45.00,00:16:45.00,>> It's actually turning out to be a nice-looking bench.
280,00:16:47.25,00:16:47.25,">> This is the coolest stuff. >> You're the coolest, Bob."
281,00:16:50.04,00:16:50.04,">> I don't like to spend money on stuff, so I tinker."
282,00:16:52.17,00:16:52.17,"If I don't know how to do it, I go to the library and get the"
283,00:16:54.54,00:16:54.54,"book, look it up and go do it. I'm going to make something"
284,00:16:57.62,00:16:57.62,"like this when I get home. >> Bob, at what point are we"
285,00:17:00.08,00:17:00.08,going to eat? (laughter)
286,00:17:14.08,00:17:14.08,">> Oh, yeah? Oh, great."
287,00:17:15.67,00:17:15.67,We got some huts to begin with. Awesome.
288,00:17:18.17,00:17:18.17,>> This will work. >> This will work.
289,00:17:20.29,00:17:20.29,"Yeah, all right, so, apparently, according to some"
290,00:17:22.96,00:17:22.96,"people, we sucked today. I don't think so."
291,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,I thought we were awesome. And I think that's what we need
292,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,to do is we've just got to keep that awesome spirit going.
293,00:17:32.04,00:17:32.04,"There's an African word for ""fierce."""
294,00:17:33.96,00:17:33.96,It's... bucale! (all chattering)
295,00:17:36.38,00:17:36.38,>> I don't know if I believe you on that.
296,00:17:38.12,00:17:38.12,>> All right. (cheering)
297,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,"I always try and maintain a positive attitude, and I just"
298,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,"hope that our tribe, the Fang tribe, will stay positive."
299,00:17:48.96,00:17:48.96,"This is cool. Hey, this is awesome."
300,00:17:52.33,00:17:52.33,And maybe they'll forget I was the old broad that fell up the
301,00:17:55.00,00:17:55.00,hill. (laughs)
302,00:17:56.92,00:17:56.92,"Hey, you guys, if anybody finds any elephant dung, bring it"
303,00:18:00.17,00:18:00.17,back. It burns well.
304,00:18:02.12,00:18:02.12,>> We've been here 20 minutes and she wants elephant ...
305,00:18:05.96,00:18:05.96,">> Oh, elephant dung. >> Oh."
306,00:18:10.17,00:18:10.17,">> Isn't that interesting? Obviously, one has to be wary."
307,00:18:13.96,00:18:13.96,There are elephants around because there was elephant dung
308,00:18:16.17,00:18:16.17,that we walked over. But let's hope that they just
309,00:18:18.67,00:18:18.67,"keep their distance. And if we can get fire going, it"
310,00:18:21.33,00:18:21.33,will certainly keep animals from coming around the camp.
311,00:18:24.42,00:18:24.42,So you want to see the elephant dung?
312,00:18:26.54,00:18:26.54,>> Not really. >> It's very interesting.
313,00:18:28.21,00:18:28.21,Look. >> You want to see my dung?
314,00:18:30.92,00:18:30.92,"It's interesting, too. >> They poop out the seeds that"
315,00:18:35.08,00:18:35.08,"they don't digest. And we were wondering, maybe"
316,00:18:37.17,00:18:37.17,there might be something edible inside still.
317,00:18:39.29,00:18:39.29,">> Oh, don't even think about that."
318,00:18:42.25,00:18:42.25,">> This is our first day, and I've come to the conclusion"
319,00:18:45.83,00:18:45.83,that Gillian is annoying. >> You can.
320,00:18:48.58,00:18:48.58,You can squeeze elephant dung and drink it.
321,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,">> She is so busy at just trying to look busy, and she's"
322,00:18:54.75,00:18:54.75,"not accomplishing crap. >> You know, here."
323,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,>> I know. >> Kick it open.
324,00:19:03.21,00:19:03.21,">> They're in there. You want, you want to be the"
325,00:19:06.04,00:19:06.04,"first to try a termite? >> You don't have to cook them,"
326,00:19:08.17,00:19:08.17,right? You can just eat them.
327,00:19:09.46,00:19:09.46,>> You just eat them. I found a queen one.
328,00:19:12.00,00:19:12.00,"This is a lot of protein. As a professional gamer, there"
329,00:19:15.79,00:19:15.79,"is a stereotype that, you know, you're antisocial, you're a"
330,00:19:18.79,00:19:18.79,"nerd, and you sit in your basement all the time."
331,00:19:21.12,00:19:21.12,"And of course, I mean, girls don't dig that."
332,00:19:23.25,00:19:23.25,Are you going to eat it? Are you really going to eat it?
333,00:19:25.46,00:19:25.46,It'll be hot if do you that. Everything that...
334,00:19:30.08,00:19:30.08,You ate it? How'd it taste?
335,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,>> I don't know. I just swallowed it.
336,00:19:33.96,00:19:33.96,>> You got some protein. >> I just ate a termite.
337,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,">> That was hot. >> My God, I just ate a termite!"
338,00:19:42.00,00:19:42.00,"(laughs) >> Back home, I am very shy with"
339,00:19:44.54,00:19:44.54,the girls that I like. Last girl I kissed was
340,00:19:47.71,00:19:47.71,"actually in high school. That was, like, four, five years"
341,00:19:50.62,00:19:50.62,"ago, which is a long time. That was the queen termite."
342,00:19:55.08,00:19:55.08,That wasn't any ordinary termite.
343,00:19:56.42,00:19:56.42,">> I know, you gave me something special there."
344,00:19:58.08,00:19:58.08,"Like, seriously... >> Yeah, that was my gift to"
345,00:19:59.83,00:19:59.83,you. >> Thank you.
346,00:20:01.12,00:20:01.12,">> But being here in Gabon with a girl that, you know, you are"
347,00:20:05.04,00:20:05.04,attracted to is a very special moment in life.
348,00:20:08.17,00:20:08.17,"I mean, I am single, and she is single."
349,00:20:10.79,00:20:10.79,You never know. A romance could start.
350,00:20:13.12,00:20:13.12,>> It tasted like chocolate. (Ken mutters)
351,00:20:24.21,00:20:24.21,>> We've got the cantinas right now.
352,00:20:25.88,00:20:25.88,"Why don't we try and do all the other stuff, get a great camp,"
353,00:20:28.54,00:20:28.54,and then we'll work on getting the water and fire.
354,00:20:31.04,00:20:31.04,">> Um, just from personal need, where are we going to put the"
355,00:20:34.21,00:20:34.21,"latrines? >> Do you guys want us to dig,"
356,00:20:36.12,00:20:36.12,"like, a three-foot, like, thing? >> No, not a deep hole."
357,00:20:39.50,00:20:39.50,>> So then what are we doing? Does everybody individually dig
358,00:20:42.50,00:20:42.50,"their own hole, poop, and then cover it up?"
359,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,>> The Roman legions used to do it...
360,00:20:45.92,00:20:45.92,"The latrine moves. So we cut down, we cut down a"
361,00:20:48.67,00:20:48.67,"foot, and then we cover it up. And when it's completely flat"
362,00:20:52.58,00:20:52.58,"again, we move the latrine. I don't want to punish you guys."
363,00:20:54.83,00:20:54.83,"I mean, I'll go do it. >> I don't mind doing the"
364,00:20:56.71,00:20:56.71,latrine. I'm just confused on how to do
365,00:20:58.54,00:20:58.54,it. >> I'm the full package.
366,00:21:05.58,00:21:05.58,I'm not just a physical competitor.
367,00:21:08.25,00:21:08.25,I'm a mental competitor. I have no fear of being the
368,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,sole survivor. I have no fear of standing in
369,00:21:13.83,00:21:13.83,front of Jeff and expecting my check for a million dollars.
370,00:21:18.58,00:21:18.58,"What I've done at the moment is give suggestions, let other"
371,00:21:22.88,00:21:22.88,"people carry them out, take some of the benefit, and then"
372,00:21:25.38,00:21:25.38,"they go, ""But you know who suggested that, right?"
373,00:21:27.33,00:21:27.33,"Ace."" Why don't we go into two groups"
374,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,and get some really dry wood and try and do the fire thing?
375,00:21:37.29,00:21:37.29,">> Ace, he's like charismatic, and I think he has a plan."
376,00:21:41.42,00:21:41.42,"Like, he's here to play hard. I think the best strategy right"
377,00:21:44.58,00:21:44.58,"now is to just lay low. >> Our best bet is probably to,"
378,00:21:47.25,00:21:47.25,"like, let Ace run the show for a while."
379,00:21:49.92,00:21:49.92,My prediction is Ace is going to get obnoxious.
380,00:21:51.88,00:21:51.88,"Like, let's sort of let him, if he can, dig his own grave for a"
381,00:21:55.25,00:21:55.25,while. >> People say you don't need
382,00:21:56.29,00:21:56.29,"friends here, but if you can find a friend or someone you"
383,00:21:58.46,00:21:58.46,"trust, I think that's, like, it means a lot."
384,00:22:01.75,00:22:01.75,"And, like, I was like, I'll either be playing this game"
385,00:22:03.50,00:22:03.50,alone or find someone who I have a connection with.
386,00:22:05.04,00:22:05.04,I feel that I have a special bond with Marcus.
387,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,"Ever since I saw him on the mat and he picked me, I just felt"
388,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,"this connection in his deep, blue, beautiful eyes."
389,00:22:14.88,00:22:14.88,>> Do you think I had any doubt that you're a well-balanced
390,00:22:17.75,00:22:17.75,"human being-- like, I wouldn't be talking to you like this if I"
391,00:22:20.08,00:22:20.08,"did, so... >> Okay, cool."
392,00:22:21.25,00:22:21.25,"All right. It feels good to, like, trust"
393,00:22:23.29,00:22:23.29,one person at least. >> Yeah.
394,00:22:25.25,00:22:25.25,The thing with Charlie is I think he's attracted to me.
395,00:22:27.62,00:22:27.62,"But, you know, I'll be honest. Like, I don't see any romance"
396,00:22:30.25,00:22:30.25,with Charlie and I. I think he's a great guy.
397,00:22:31.83,00:22:31.83,"You know, I can see that he's handsome and smart and all"
398,00:22:33.96,00:22:33.96,"those things, and I really can appreciate that about him,"
399,00:22:35.58,00:22:35.58,"um, but it's not really the way I roll."
400,00:22:38.17,00:22:38.17,">> You're a nice guy, and you know it."
401,00:22:39.46,00:22:39.46,">> Yeah, I'm chill, that's all. I'm straight, so we're in"
402,00:22:42.25,00:22:42.25,"Eden, but there's no two Adams here."
403,00:22:44.67,00:22:44.67,(both chuckle) (trumpeting)
404,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,>> Don't they have more bears than...
405,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,">> Shh, there it is! There it is."
406,00:23:01.25,00:23:01.25,>> You guys hear that? >> What is that?
407,00:23:04.00,00:23:04.00,>> Sounds like something calling.
408,00:23:07.67,00:23:07.67,(trumpeting) >> There it was again.
409,00:23:11.25,00:23:11.25,(elephant trumpeting) >> The animals are starting to
410,00:23:13.79,00:23:13.79,lurk around camp. There's an elephant 30 yards
411,00:23:17.08,00:23:17.08,"from our house, just cruising through the forest right behind"
412,00:23:20.04,00:23:20.04,"our little huts, so it's a little bit frightening."
413,00:23:23.17,00:23:23.17,"(elephant trumpeting) >> Shh, shh, shh."
414,00:23:27.75,00:23:27.75,(rustling) >> Ow!
415,00:23:28.79,00:23:28.79,">> Oh, no! >> I think I have a small"
416,00:23:30.25,00:23:30.25,scratch. >> See it?
417,00:23:31.83,00:23:31.83,>> Holy crap. >> I was walking back to camp
418,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,and I was kneeling down to get into our little house and I hit
419,00:23:38.21,00:23:38.21,"my head on a sharp branch. The second I hit my head, I felt"
420,00:23:42.29,00:23:42.29,the blood running down my face. I don't know how bad it is.
421,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,All I know is it's bleeding a hell of a lot.
422,00:23:47.12,00:23:47.12,"Nurse, do you know anything about scratches?"
423,00:23:49.50,00:23:49.50,">> Well, hmm. Sorry, can't see a thing."
424,00:23:53.79,00:23:53.79,>> It was totally dark around here.
425,00:23:56.38,00:23:56.38,">> There I am, this nurse in the dark."
426,00:23:58.50,00:23:58.50,A real clinical challenge for me and everybody's looking at me
427,00:24:01.21,00:24:01.21,like I'm going to be able to do something about it.
428,00:24:03.21,00:24:03.21,"Yeah, right. >> Right."
429,00:24:10.29,00:24:10.29,">> At the risk of being like a mother, you've got to really"
430,00:24:13.12,00:24:13.12,"take care of yourself out here. Just be careful; otherwise,"
431,00:24:16.12,00:24:16.12,"you're going to get hurt. So, we've called the medical to"
432,00:24:18.62,00:24:18.62,come and take a look at it. >> You can use that anesthesia
433,00:24:26.25,00:24:26.25,any time you want. A .22 gauge needle.
434,00:24:31.17,00:24:31.17,"It's going to sting, Randy. >> Break up the monotony of our"
435,00:24:33.83,00:24:33.83,first night here. >> You'll feel a sharp sting.
436,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,My suspicion is you're going to need a few stitches there.
437,00:24:41.42,00:24:41.42,">> Just a couple? >> Yeah, yeah."
438,00:24:45.00,00:24:45.00,You okay? >> The cut is smarting a little
439,00:24:49.12,00:24:49.12,bit. No need to stop; just go for it.
440,00:24:51.38,00:24:51.38,">> Yeah, get it done. All right?"
441,00:25:06.88,00:25:06.88,>> Just so I stay in the game. I can live with the scar.
442,00:25:09.96,00:25:09.96,I couldn't see it. I don't have eyes on the top of
443,00:25:12.08,00:25:12.08,my head. I didn't know if it was three
444,00:25:14.00,00:25:14.00,stitches or 30 stitches. I knew it was bleeding a lot.
445,00:25:16.46,00:25:16.46,But leaving this game is not an option.
446,00:25:19.38,00:25:19.38,And I am petrified that this injury could take me out of the
447,00:25:23.25,00:25:23.25,game. (trumpeting)
448,00:25:40.17,00:25:40.17,">> You hungry? Man, we've got some good food."
449,00:25:41.29,00:25:41.29,">> Yeah, we got some... >> Like what?"
450,00:25:42.92,00:25:42.92,>> Grasshoppers and crickets and...
451,00:25:45.17,00:25:45.17,>> Eww. >> Who wants them?
452,00:25:47.21,00:25:47.21,>> You might want them. >> I'm full.
453,00:25:50.00,00:25:50.00,"(laughter) Last night, I cut my head."
454,00:25:53.96,00:25:53.96,"The doctors were great. I think it only took, like, two"
455,00:25:56.67,00:25:56.67,or three stitches. I don't know.
456,00:25:58.17,00:25:58.17,And they put this huge bandage on it.
457,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,"But it's better today than it was yesterday, which means it"
458,00:26:05.25,00:26:05.25,will be fine in a couple days. >> I'm supposed to be on the
459,00:26:13.04,00:26:13.04,frigging equator. Where the hell is the sun?
460,00:26:15.54,00:26:15.54,"Seriously, like, I'm just freezing."
461,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,>> Look at her. She's miserable.
462,00:26:23.08,00:26:23.08,">> Think you'll be... >> It's really, really, really"
463,00:26:25.58,00:26:25.58,"cold at night. And I'm really bony, so I'm"
464,00:26:28.67,00:26:28.67,"sleeping bone on wood, and I don't have any, like, cushion,"
465,00:26:32.50,00:26:32.50,so nights are definitely the hardest.
466,00:26:35.54,00:26:35.54,>> You got some fire? >> No.
467,00:26:37.29,00:26:37.29,">> Bone is pretty hard, isn't it?"
468,00:26:38.62,00:26:38.62,>> Not hard enough to create spark.
469,00:26:39.83,00:26:39.83,>> No. >> You don't think?
470,00:26:43.08,00:26:43.08,I don't think that's going to work.
471,00:26:45.42,00:26:45.42,>> Trying to make fire with a bone.
472,00:26:48.83,00:26:48.83,"I don't think I got stuck with the brightest bunch, that's for"
473,00:26:51.25,00:26:51.25,sure. I just kind of keep thinking
474,00:26:53.17,00:26:53.17,"""Why did I get stuck with all these people and the other"
475,00:26:55.50,00:26:55.50,"team's got all, like, these smart, beautiful people, and I'm"
476,00:26:58.58,00:26:58.58,"stuck with these dorks?"" >> Where is the tree mail?"
477,00:27:19.75,00:27:19.75,There it is. Our first tree mail.
478,00:27:23.62,00:27:23.62,>> Let's bring it back. >> Yeah.
479,00:27:25.00,00:27:25.00,">> Let's bring it back to camp. >> Okay, let's do it."
480,00:27:27.83,00:27:27.83,">> Okay. ""You've had a cold, dark night"
481,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,"in the jungle, and your situation is feeling dire."
482,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,"Wouldn't you love some security and a nice, big roaring"
483,00:27:35.46,00:27:35.46,fire? >> Yeah!
484,00:27:38.00,00:27:38.00,">> ""Well, you'd better move together for a chance to win the"
485,00:27:40.08,00:27:40.08,flame. If you're not the first to
486,00:27:41.54,00:27:41.54,"finish, you may be the first to leave the game."""
487,00:27:46.46,00:27:46.46,">> All right, so we're going to do a little combined meditation."
488,00:27:50.17,00:27:50.17,"So, focus on something. Hands up."
489,00:27:57.17,00:27:57.17,"Going into this challenge, I wanted us all to be, like,"
490,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,"really in sync, so I felt a little yoga would really sort"
491,00:28:03.88,00:28:03.88,"of clean out our humors, get our energy flowing; the chakras"
492,00:28:07.62,00:28:07.62,would be all in tine. And just get us excited and
493,00:28:12.21,00:28:12.21,motivated for this next challenge.
494,00:28:14.08,00:28:14.08,Just breathe into it if you feel any sort of shudder.
495,00:28:16.96,00:28:16.96,(snickers) >> I should be stretching too.
496,00:28:26.38,00:28:26.38,"(laughing) >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
497,00:28:56.79,00:28:56.79,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
498,00:28:58.38,00:28:58.38,>> Yes. >> Yeah.

502,00:29:09.62,00:29:09.62,a series of hitching posts. You'll then dig up three bags
503,00:29:13.12,00:29:13.12,of puzzle pieces... and make your way to the finish
504,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,where the three remaining tribe members will use those
505,00:29:20.38,00:29:20.38,pieces to solve the puzzle. First tribe to solve the puzzle
506,00:29:24.71,00:29:24.71,wins. Want to know what you're
507,00:29:27.58,00:29:27.58,playing for? >> Yeah.

543,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,Million-dollar game. >> Whoo!
544,00:31:38.79,00:31:38.79,">> Two more, two more. >> Come on!"

564,00:32:39.29,00:32:39.29,"Start solving it. >> I teach physics, so I was all"
565,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,excited to do the puzzle. It's like working in the
566,00:32:47.79,00:32:47.79,classroom. >> PROBST: Solve it one bag at a
567,00:32:49.92,00:32:49.92,"time, one puzzle at a time. >> Come on, Fang!"
568,00:32:53.62,00:32:53.62,You're not out of it yet! >> Got it! Got it! Got it!
569,00:32:58.96,00:32:58.96,">> Come on, guys, right here. >> PROBST: Kota has the first"
570,00:33:00.83,00:33:00.83,third of their puzzle solved. Two bags left.
571,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,">> You're fine! Keep going! >> Okay, these two go together."
572,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,>> Kota on their last part of the puzzle now.
573,00:33:14.58,00:33:14.58,This challenge is an absolute blowout at this point.
574,00:33:17.29,00:33:17.29,>> Dig fast! Dig! >> PROBST: It might be time to
575,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,"put it in the deep freeze, Gillian."
576,00:33:22.50,00:33:22.50,You might be out of it. >> Nothing's gone till it's
577,00:33:24.25,00:33:24.25,gone. >> I'm really tired of that
578,00:33:26.29,00:33:26.29,"accent. I understand ""never quit"", but"
579,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,"dude, we lost. >> Come on, guys!"
580,00:33:33.58,00:33:33.58,Keep going! It's not over till it's over!
581,00:33:37.12,00:33:37.12,">> Fang, let's go! Come on! >> You're okay!"
582,00:33:40.58,00:33:40.58,">> PROBST: Fang coming around the corner, but it's too late."

585,00:33:56.29,00:33:56.29,"far, three days in, this is not even close."
586,00:33:59.04,00:33:59.04,"Two absolute blowouts. Kota, congratulations."
587,00:34:03.33,00:34:03.33,(cheering) >> Yeah!
588,00:34:05.21,00:34:05.21,">> PROBST: Immunity, nobody going home tonight."
589,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,"Also, the other half, fire in the form of flint."
590,00:34:14.67,00:34:14.67,"Fang, the only thing I have for you is a date with me tonight"
591,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,"at Tribal Council, where one of you will be going home tonight."
592,00:34:20.79,00:34:20.79,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
593,00:35:00.04,00:35:00.04,"(trumpeting) >> Good job, you guys."
594,00:35:09.38,00:35:09.38,">> We did not get destroyed. >> All right, awesome."
595,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,>> And we are not unorganized. >> We were winning till the
596,00:35:13.50,00:35:13.50,"third quarter. >> Okay, guys."
597,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,">> We lost another challenge. We could have had fire tonight,"
598,00:35:18.58,00:35:18.58,"and most importantly, we could have kept our tribe together."
599,00:35:22.04,00:35:22.04,">> We need somebody, and none of us want to do it, step up and"
600,00:35:25.21,00:35:25.21,"say, ""I'm leader."" >> I'm the only one who is not"
601,00:35:28.29,00:35:28.29,worried about getting voted off because I did win that first
602,00:35:30.75,00:35:30.75,"immunity challenge. And it feels good, but at the"
603,00:35:33.12,00:35:33.12,"same time, there is nobody stepped up as a leader of the"
604,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,"tribe. So, we got to have some kind of"
605,00:35:37.96,00:35:37.96,"game plan. >> What are you hearing,"
606,00:35:44.79,00:35:44.79,"anything? >> Yeah, Michelle."
607,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,>> Why is our team better without Michelle?
608,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,>> Because right now we're... >> I'm not arguing with you.
609,00:35:49.62,00:35:49.62,>> ...we're in a down-and-out position; we need positivity.
610,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,She's negative; she doesn't want to be here; she's miserable.
611,00:35:56.12,00:35:56.12,>> I'm up in the air. I'll do whatever.
612,00:35:57.92,00:35:57.92,>> Michelle. >> Michelle. Michelle.
613,00:35:59.71,00:35:59.71,">> That's a good reason... >> You know what, you do what"
614,00:36:01.88,00:36:01.88,you think you got to do. That's who I'm gonna go with.
615,00:36:04.38,00:36:04.38,">> That's who I'm going for. As of now, I'm voting Michelle."
616,00:36:06.71,00:36:06.71,>> Just let me know where you're at-- I'm there.
617,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,">> Me, too. >> Are you guys feeling me or"
618,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"no? Randy, you look like you're not"
619,00:36:14.62,00:36:14.62,feeling me good. >> It's early.
620,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,I'm-I'm... I hear you. >> It's not that early.
621,00:36:21.67,00:36:21.67,">> If I believed that Michelle was getting five, six, seven,"
622,00:36:25.58,00:36:25.58,"eight votes tonight, I'd have no problem voting for her."
623,00:36:28.12,00:36:28.12,"It's just, I don't buy it yet. >> Hot."
624,00:36:31.75,00:36:31.75,">> Get out of the sun, then. >> I would prefer Gillian to go"
625,00:36:34.92,00:36:34.92,"tonight, just because... she's a 60-year-old woman."
626,00:36:40.12,00:36:40.12,"Nothing against the 60-year-old women out there,"
627,00:36:42.42,00:36:42.42,but don't come to my camp. >> You guys were great.
628,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,"You just had to dig differently, and that's all."
629,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,>> I didn't think about that. >> So just because it seems
630,00:36:50.83,00:36:50.83,"like we're disorganized, I don't think any of us think we are."
631,00:36:55.38,00:36:55.38,">> She cheerleads and blows sunshine, thinking they're gonna"
632,00:36:58.79,00:36:58.79,"like her, but, to be honest, Gillian is worthless, totally"
633,00:37:02.58,00:37:02.58,"worthless. >> So, who's leaving tonight?"
634,00:37:07.21,00:37:07.21,>> I really want to... want to vote out Gillian.
635,00:37:10.25,00:37:10.25,>> That's what I was thinking. She's the oldest and would slow
636,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,us down the most. >> Gillian is our weakest
637,00:37:17.33,00:37:17.33,"member, like, in everything, and we do need physical players"
638,00:37:19.71,00:37:19.71,"right now. Like, she's a nice lady, but I"
639,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,don't think she's meant for this game.
640,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,I don't know how everybody else is gonna vote.
641,00:37:27.08,00:37:27.08,I think you're on the outs right now.
642,00:37:30.21,00:37:30.21,">> Really? >> Yeah. I mean, we're the..."
643,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,">> That's so funny 'cause that would just, like, confirm my"
644,00:37:35.75,00:37:35.75,"belief in this tribe that they're, like, the dumbest"
645,00:37:38.00,00:37:38.00,people on earth. >> You don't talk to anybody
646,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,"besides me, so they do think... >> They're all retarded. Like..."
647,00:37:43.79,00:37:43.79,>> I know. I would really rather keep
648,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,"Michelle in this tribe because I really do like Michelle, and I"
649,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,really do think that she would be allies with me.
650,00:37:54.79,00:37:54.79,>> It's hard for me to pretend to like people that... really
651,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,frustrate me. >> I seriously don't know what's
652,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,gonna go on at Tribal Council tonight.
653,00:38:03.25,00:38:03.25,I think it's gonna be a mixed vote.
654,00:38:07.04,00:38:07.04,>> She's Negative Nancy. >> And there will be no
655,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,hesitation in me tonight to vote Michelle off for that whole
656,00:38:11.83,00:38:11.83,"reason. >> Me, neither."
657,00:38:13.04,00:38:13.04,>> She's-she's sad. She just doesn't need to be
658,00:38:15.29,00:38:15.29,here. I personally had absolutely no
659,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,qualms about myself voting for Michelle.
660,00:38:21.54,00:38:21.54,"I'm sorry, but I think Michelle needs to go home, for her sake"
661,00:38:24.54,00:38:24.54,and for our sake. She's just having too hard a
662,00:38:26.67,00:38:26.67,"time, and it's not good for all of us."
663,00:38:30.08,00:38:30.08,Bad vibes is just not a good thing to have around.
664,00:38:34.17,00:38:34.17,I might be the naive woman that's just walking around
665,00:38:36.58,00:38:36.58,"thinking, ""Tra-la, it's not me, thank God,"" um, but it may be."
666,00:38:40.42,00:38:40.42,"Uh, I doubt it, though. I really feel Michelle just"
667,00:38:43.12,00:38:43.12,doesn't want to be here. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
668,00:39:16.21,00:39:16.21,>> PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch.
669,00:39:18.25,00:39:18.25,"Grab a torch, approach a flame, dip it in, and get fire."
670,00:39:20.79,00:39:20.79,This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because in this
671,00:39:24.08,00:39:24.08,"game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, you"
672,00:39:31.25,00:39:31.25,"are still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are"
673,00:39:34.08,00:39:34.08,you. That will be the case for one of
674,00:39:36.75,00:39:36.75,"you tonight. Well, let's just get right into"
675,00:39:43.08,00:39:43.08,"it. Dan, let me ask you how you guys"
676,00:39:46.17,00:39:46.17,think you did at today's immunity challenge.
677,00:39:48.46,00:39:48.46,>> I think we did okay. I think we did... I think we did
678,00:39:51.17,00:39:51.17,better than we expected. >> PROBST: You think you did
679,00:39:53.04,00:39:53.04,okay. >> I do.
680,00:39:54.62,00:39:54.62,">> PROBST: So in addition to being a complete disaster, this"
681,00:39:57.79,00:39:57.79,tribe is in total denial. >> I disagree.
682,00:39:59.92,00:39:59.92,I don't think it was a complete and utter disaster.
683,00:40:02.75,00:40:02.75,"I think we can take those guys, and, uh, we're looking forward"
684,00:40:05.58,00:40:05.58,to the next challenge. >> PROBST (chuckles): 'Kay.
685,00:40:08.12,00:40:08.12,"Michelle, give me the play-by-play."
686,00:40:09.88,00:40:09.88,You were in there. What was going on?
687,00:40:11.83,00:40:11.83,">> Well, it took a long time, and there were people taking"
688,00:40:14.58,00:40:14.58,"breaks. Uh, Ken was taking a break."
689,00:40:16.83,00:40:16.83,G-Sizzle resting on his bag digging with one hand.
690,00:40:20.17,00:40:20.17,">> I'm-I'm sorry. I got tired. I mean, I got exhausted, so,"
691,00:40:23.21,00:40:23.21,"yeah, I took a break. If that was the reason we lost,"
692,00:40:26.00,00:40:26.00,"I'm sorry, but, I mean... >> Well, it wasn't the reason we"
693,00:40:28.71,00:40:28.71,won 'cause we're sitting here. >> You can't go a hundred
694,00:40:32.12,00:40:32.12,"percent, a hundred percent of the time."
695,00:40:34.17,00:40:34.17,">> Um, that's what a challenge is, that's what a race is."
696,00:40:36.25,00:40:36.25,You don't stop till the job is done.
697,00:40:38.54,00:40:38.54,">> Oh, for Pete's sake, then why didn't you step up at that"
698,00:40:41.08,00:40:41.08,point and just get right on it? >> I didn't stop digging.
699,00:40:43.25,00:40:43.25,>> But you should've verbalized it.
700,00:40:44.46,00:40:44.46,"You should've said, ""Hey, will you do this?"""
701,00:40:46.08,00:40:46.08,">> That's what I was doing. ""Come on, y'all, hustle!"""
702,00:40:48.21,00:40:48.21,">> All right, all right, you're right."
703,00:40:50.12,00:40:50.12,"(several talking at once) >> There was a barrier there, so"
704,00:40:53.08,00:40:53.08,we could not see you guys. >> I just thought it's common
705,00:40:55.50,00:40:55.50,"sense that, you know, when we're in a race that you don't stop"
706,00:40:57.96,00:40:57.96,"until we're done or we win. >> PROBST: Well, I'll tell you"
707,00:41:03.75,00:41:03.75,"what I just saw. I asked a simple question, and"
708,00:41:06.12,00:41:06.12,immediately you guys went into arguing about something else.
709,00:41:10.83,00:41:10.83,"So, Crystal, who's leading this tribe?"
710,00:41:13.38,00:41:13.38,">> Right now, at this current moment, we don't have a distinct"
711,00:41:16.46,00:41:16.46,leader. It's frustrating.
712,00:41:20.00,00:41:20.00,">> PROBST: Gillian, you started picking this tribe."
713,00:41:22.58,00:41:22.58,Are you happy with the fact that you still don't have any
714,00:41:25.75,00:41:25.75,leadership? >> I think there are plenty
715,00:41:27.88,00:41:27.88,"leaders in the group, but I think that a lot of people feel"
716,00:41:30.38,00:41:30.38,like it's kind of the death knell to... to come out as the
717,00:41:33.42,00:41:33.42,leader. >> PROBST: Anybody willing to
718,00:41:34.96,00:41:34.96,"step up and say, ""I think I could help us avoid coming to"
719,00:41:37.67,00:41:37.67,"Tribal Council""? Anybody willing?"
720,00:41:41.25,00:41:41.25,>> I think it would be a good idea if we had someone who we
721,00:41:44.75,00:41:44.75,"all looked up to and said, ""You could definitely be the leader"
722,00:41:48.08,00:41:48.08,"of our tribe,"" but since none of us have that feeling toward..."
723,00:41:50.50,00:41:50.50,">> I think you could. >> I happen to think you could,"
724,00:41:52.54,00:41:52.54,too. >> I think it needs to be
725,00:41:54.33,00:41:54.33,discussed. (several talking at once)
726,00:41:56.12,00:41:56.12,>> As long as they're open to the eight other soldiers'
727,00:41:58.54,00:41:58.54,"opinions or strategies, I think you got a great style."
728,00:42:00.50,00:42:00.50,">> I appreciate you guys saying that, but maybe I don't have the"
729,00:42:03.42,00:42:03.42,courage to be the leader because I don't want to lead you
730,00:42:05.62,00:42:05.62,in the wrong direction and have you upset with me for... for
731,00:42:08.54,00:42:08.54,"making that decision. But if I was volunteered, I'll"
732,00:42:10.67,00:42:10.67,"take it. If they want me to roll with it,"
733,00:42:12.96,00:42:12.96,"I mean, I'll do it. >> PROBST: GC's willing to be"
734,00:42:15.25,00:42:15.25,the leader. Who's in favor of that?
735,00:42:16.92,00:42:16.92,">> I didn't say that, either. I said if they wanted me to..."
736,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,>> PROBST: GC is open to being the leader if you would like him
737,00:42:23.67,00:42:23.67,to be. >> I'll give you the answer now.
738,00:42:25.46,00:42:25.46,"Yes, I would vote for GC to be the leader."
739,00:42:28.79,00:42:28.79,>> PROBST: Randy. >> Good luck.
740,00:42:30.83,00:42:30.83,">> PROBST: Gillian, you all right with GC?"
741,00:42:32.62,00:42:32.62,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: How about you,"
742,00:42:34.25,00:42:34.25,Michelle? >> Yes.

744,00:42:37.58,00:42:37.58,"candidate. >> PROBST: How about you, Susie?"
745,00:42:39.21,00:42:39.21,>> I'm good with that. >> PROBST: Matty?
746,00:42:40.62,00:42:40.62,>> I'm fine with that. >> PROBST: We accomplished
747,00:42:42.33,00:42:42.33,something big. I'm impressed.
748,00:42:44.67,00:42:44.67,"Fang has a leader, and his name is GC."
749,00:42:48.92,00:42:48.92,Good. Let's talk about relationships.
750,00:42:51.75,00:42:51.75,"Michelle, who are you closest to out here?"
751,00:42:54.08,00:42:54.08,">> Probably... Ken. We're both the youngest, and"
752,00:42:56.96,00:42:56.96,we were both the last picked. I like talking to him the most.
753,00:43:00.21,00:43:00.21,>> PROBST: How much does it weigh on you that you were the
754,00:43:02.75,00:43:02.75,"last person picked? >> I kind of wasn't surprised,"
755,00:43:06.08,00:43:06.08,"but I think that in the first challenge, I proved myself very"
756,00:43:10.83,00:43:10.83,"worthy of being in any tribe, and I definitely think there's"
757,00:43:14.62,00:43:14.62,some deadweight that we could throw off the boat that would
758,00:43:17.83,00:43:17.83,"make us a little stronger, a little faster."
759,00:43:23.54,00:43:23.54,">> PROBST: Gillian, on the flip side, you struggled in that"
760,00:43:26.54,00:43:26.54,"first challenge. >> Well, I saw the challenge,"
761,00:43:28.67,00:43:28.67,"and I thought, ""I'm dead."" Yeah, it sucked, and I was."
762,00:43:31.71,00:43:31.71,I'm the old bag that had to be helped up by two young bucks up
763,00:43:34.75,00:43:34.75,"the hill. But, you guys, thank you."
764,00:43:36.83,00:43:36.83,But I hope that everybody's been able to see that there's
765,00:43:39.54,00:43:39.54,actually more to me than just the gray hair and the old woman
766,00:43:42.33,00:43:42.33,"that sucked on the hill. >> PROBST: All right, it's time"
767,00:43:46.21,00:43:46.21,"to get to the vote. GC, you have the immunity"
768,00:43:47.79,00:43:47.79,"necklace. As always, you can give it to"
769,00:43:49.92,00:43:49.92,somebody else if you want to or keep it for yourself.
770,00:43:51.58,00:43:51.58,>> I'm going to go ahead and rock this for tonight.
771,00:43:53.21,00:43:53.21,I'll roll with it. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
772,00:43:55.04,00:43:55.04,GC. Everybody else is fair game.
773,00:43:57.33,00:43:57.33,"It's time to vote. Matty, you're up."
774,00:44:00.25,00:44:00.25,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> I think you're the weakest on
775,00:44:26.04,00:44:26.04,this tribe. That's pretty much it.
776,00:44:29.04,00:44:29.04,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> I don't think you want to be
777,00:44:43.00,00:44:43.00,here. And with your whole attitude
778,00:44:45.04,00:44:45.04,"about everything, I don't think you should be."
779,00:44:47.33,00:44:47.33,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
780,00:45:07.25,00:45:07.25,votes. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
781,00:45:18.29,00:45:18.29,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
782,00:45:20.58,00:45:20.58,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Counsel area
783,00:45:23.17,00:45:23.17,immediately. I'll read the votes.
784,00:45:28.38,00:45:28.38,First vote... Michelle. Gillian.
785,00:45:35.04,00:45:35.04,One vote Michelle; one vote Gillian.
786,00:45:39.25,00:45:39.25,Michelle. Two votes Michelle;
787,00:45:42.04,00:45:42.04,one vote Gillian. Michelle.
788,00:45:47.04,00:45:47.04,Three votes Michelle; one vote Gillian.
789,00:45:51.46,00:45:51.46,Michelle. That's four votes Michelle;
790,00:45:55.21,00:45:55.21,one vote Gillian. First person voted out of
791,00:45:59.08,00:45:59.08,Survivor: Gabon:  Michelle. That's five; that's enough.
792,00:46:02.92,00:46:02.92,Need to bring me your torch. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
793,00:46:12.62,00:46:12.62,"Michelle, the Tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
794,00:46:19.25,00:46:19.25,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Well, you came in here as a"
795,00:46:32.00,00:46:32.00,group of individuals. It seems like you found the
796,00:46:34.67,00:46:34.67,necessary leadership to leave here as a tribe.
797,00:46:38.12,00:46:38.12,More good news: you'll be taking your torches with you
798,00:46:40.21,00:46:40.21,"back to camp, which means you will have fire."
799,00:46:42.25,00:46:42.25,"(cheering) >> Thank you, God!"
800,00:46:45.88,00:46:45.88,>> PROBST: Here's your flint. Grab your torches.
801,00:46:48.88,00:46:48.88,"Head back to camp. >> Thank you, Jeff!"

804,00:47:12.58,00:47:12.58,">> Ow! Baby! Oh, yeah."
805,00:47:17.12,00:47:17.12,Another day in Gabon. Michelle's gone.
806,00:47:19.46,00:47:19.46,"Oh, man, that was rough. We had our first Tribal"
807,00:47:24.17,00:47:24.17,"Council tonight, and it sucked. We lost Michelle, and we were"
808,00:47:29.62,00:47:29.62,lucky enough to get flint tonight.
809,00:47:32.38,00:47:32.38,">> So Kenny, you want to do the honors?"
810,00:47:34.58,00:47:34.58,Or how are you feeling? >> Me? I can do the fire
811,00:47:37.21,00:47:37.21,"if you want. >> Yes, I think you should do"
812,00:47:39.54,00:47:39.54,"the fire. Yeah, he should do it."
813,00:47:40.96,00:47:40.96,">> And there should be no pressure, but as our leader, you"
814,00:47:43.21,00:47:43.21,"miss fire, and you're getting voted out."
815,00:47:45.50,00:47:45.50,">> Tonight, to my surprise, my tribe picked me to be the"
816,00:47:48.79,00:47:48.79,leader of the tribe. It kind of feels good that
817,00:47:51.08,00:47:51.08,"people want me to be the leader of the tribe, but at the same"
818,00:47:54.42,00:47:54.42,"time, I feel like I'm going to have a bigger target on my back"
819,00:47:57.67,00:47:57.67,just because of that title. >> There it is. Don't stop!
820,00:48:03.96,00:48:03.96,"Got it. Okay, don't stop. Keep it going."
821,00:48:08.75,00:48:08.75,"Yep, fire, fire, fire! >> It's going good."
822,00:48:13.54,00:48:13.54,Throw it over. >> GC is the hero.
823,00:48:16.17,00:48:16.17,>> Team captain once again. >> It feels good tonight just
824,00:48:19.42,00:48:19.42,knowing that I'm the one who got the fire started and my tribe is
825,00:48:22.42,00:48:22.42,now able to eat and we're gonna be warm.
826,00:48:25.75,00:48:25.75,>> He's excited. He's got fire. >> It's sparking right now.
827,00:48:29.17,00:48:29.17,It's cracking. The fire is cracking.
828,00:48:31.83,00:48:31.83,I'm feeling good. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
829,00:48:52.25,00:48:52.25,">> Today, things are going fairly well."
830,00:48:54.29,00:48:54.29,"I think the tribe settled down a lot after the, the great"
831,00:48:57.33,00:48:57.33,"victory we had yesterday, and we're kind of doing the daily"
832,00:49:00.12,00:49:00.12,chores. >> I love our team.
833,00:49:04.67,00:49:04.67,Our team rocks! (laughter)
834,00:49:07.96,00:49:07.96,">> Rice pudding? Oh, thank you. Very nice."
835,00:49:11.21,00:49:11.21,">> Marcus is, like, my favorite person out here."
836,00:49:13.79,00:49:13.79,He's funny. He's smart. He's athletic.
837,00:49:16.08,00:49:16.08,"He's, like, the whole package. And I can't understand"
838,00:49:19.21,00:49:19.21,why a million girls aren't jumping all over him because I
839,00:49:22.12,00:49:22.12,certainly would be if I could. >> And away we go.
840,00:49:31.71,00:49:31.71,"(bird cooing) We have a lot to talk about,"
841,00:49:36.21,00:49:36.21,I think. I can't stress enough how safe
842,00:49:39.12,00:49:39.12,"I feel because I have you because when you go off, like, I"
843,00:49:42.08,00:49:42.08,"do get this, like, pang of (gasps), you know?"
844,00:49:44.04,00:49:44.04,"And, like, when I see that you're there, it's like even"
845,00:49:46.67,00:49:46.67,"though I'm not there, like, I feel like, I'm there in spirit,"
846,00:49:49.42,00:49:49.42,"and I'm, like, yeah, like, someone's gonna back me up"
847,00:49:51.96,00:49:51.96,"if I'm, like, knocked down. Our alliance is, like,"
848,00:49:54.17,00:49:54.17,clearly... I just can't imagine
849,00:49:56.50,00:49:56.50,there being a stronger one. >> I think you just have to see
850,00:49:59.12,00:49:59.12,how every day it stacks up and gets stronger and stronger.
851,00:50:10.00,00:50:10.00,I kind of have this inner circle bond with Charlie.
852,00:50:13.62,00:50:13.62,I look at it like layers of an onion.
853,00:50:16.12,00:50:16.12,And I think Charlie's the guy that's sort of the
854,00:50:19.25,00:50:19.25,"innermost layer, then we're adding people as we go along."
855,00:50:22.04,00:50:22.04,"I, I talked to Jacquie a little bit, you know?"
856,00:50:25.25,00:50:25.25,She seems like a really cool girl.
857,00:50:27.54,00:50:27.54,And I am totally psyched 'cause I know she likes you.
858,00:50:31.79,00:50:31.79,"Like, I think Jacquie might get along."
859,00:50:37.79,00:50:37.79,">> I think at this point, it's looking like the large onion"
860,00:50:40.29,00:50:40.29,"alliance, as I might call it: myself, Charlie, Jacquie,"
861,00:50:45.00,00:50:45.00,"Corinne, is what we're shooting for."
862,00:50:47.67,00:50:47.67,Jacquie is an awesome girl and I think she's also very
863,00:50:50.21,00:50:50.21,intelligent. And I think Corinne is probably
864,00:50:52.33,00:50:52.33,the smartest one around. >> I think the best way to
865,00:50:55.62,00:50:55.62,"strategize with her is to get to know her as a person, like..."
866,00:50:58.21,00:50:58.21,>> Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Corinne
867,00:50:59.75,00:50:59.75,and kind of get a vibe for her 'cause no one's really made any
868,00:51:02.88,00:51:02.88,official pitch at this point. (buzzing)
869,00:51:15.04,00:51:15.04,">> If we're going to go look for some fruit or something, I think"
870,00:51:17.92,00:51:17.92,it'll be best to do it before it gets too hot.
871,00:51:21.42,00:51:21.42,"Susie and Crystal, would y'all mind getting fruit?"
872,00:51:26.04,00:51:26.04,"Fruit. Yeah, Matty, maybe you and Randy"
873,00:51:28.21,00:51:28.21,could find stuff that we could use maybe as spoons or bowls or
874,00:51:30.25,00:51:30.25,something. >> Okay.
875,00:51:32.21,00:51:32.21,">> You know, you get sticks, kind of like, like, uh..."
876,00:51:35.00,00:51:35.00,">> Shape 'em. >> Yeah, shape 'em and mix"
877,00:51:36.42,00:51:36.42,"foods. >> Kenny, if you want to just,"
878,00:51:39.21,00:51:39.21,"man, grass or anything, just stuff we might could use for a"
879,00:51:42.00,00:51:42.00,"good layer. Being the leader right now, I"
880,00:51:44.38,00:51:44.38,"think, is working out okay. I'm just trying to get this camp"
881,00:51:47.21,00:51:47.21,"put together. I'm a maintenance supervisor,"
882,00:51:49.00,00:51:49.00,"you know, and it's my job to build things and get them put"
883,00:51:51.00,00:51:51.00,"together. I'm like, man, let's just get"
884,00:51:53.08,00:51:53.08,this thing together and let's get this ball rolling.
885,00:51:55.08,00:51:55.08,">> If you guys want the best bedding, we'd have to weave."
886,00:51:57.71,00:51:57.71,">> At least put down a layer of grass, and whatever you're"
887,00:52:00.12,00:52:00.12,"talking about weaving, we can put on top of that."
888,00:52:02.12,00:52:02.12,">> Yeah, yeah. >> So that way, at night we're"
889,00:52:03.62,00:52:03.62,all comfortable. >> I guess I can weave all day.
890,00:52:06.75,00:52:06.75,">> Let's do it. >> All right, you ready?"
891,00:52:08.17,00:52:08.17,">> Yeah. So far, the ideas that I present"
892,00:52:10.75,00:52:10.75,"to 'em they think are pretty good, so we've got a plan for"
893,00:52:13.71,00:52:13.71,the day. >> We're gonna have to change
894,00:52:21.25,00:52:21.25,out this water. >> This is rice water.
895,00:52:23.42,00:52:23.42,">> Actually, do you mind if I try to make it?"
896,00:52:25.71,00:52:25.71,">> What, the rice? >> Yeah... if you don't mind."
897,00:52:29.67,00:52:29.67,">> No, of course not. >> If, if you're all ready, I'll"
898,00:52:31.62,00:52:31.62,"start it now. >> Yeah, tha-that's what I was"
899,00:52:33.17,00:52:33.17,doing. Just wing it.
900,00:52:35.42,00:52:35.42,"If you get too much water, we just cook it longer and..."
901,00:52:39.21,00:52:39.21,">> Okay. >> GC, you use lake water."
902,00:52:43.25,00:52:43.25,All we have up there is clean water.
903,00:52:45.58,00:52:45.58,It's boiled. >> Anything wrong with using
904,00:52:47.54,00:52:47.54,"clean water? >> Yeah, to make rice you got to"
905,00:52:49.71,00:52:49.71,"boil it again, and that doesn't make sense."
906,00:52:51.71,00:52:51.71,Boil it once and use lake water. >> What do you mean we have to
907,00:52:54.83,00:52:54.83,boil it twice? It's already boiled.
908,00:52:57.12,00:52:57.12,It's just water. Do you understand what I'm
909,00:52:59.25,00:52:59.25,saying? >> I understand what you're
910,00:53:00.92,00:53:00.92,"saying, but you're doing the work twice."
911,00:53:06.33,00:53:06.33,">> It's just water, Randy. We're surrounded by water, bro."
912,00:53:10.00,00:53:10.00,>> I get you. >> Our tribe has a leader-- GC--
913,00:53:14.12,00:53:14.12,but he's too young and he doesn't know squat about any of
914,00:53:17.00,00:53:17.00,"this, and my new operation is called Operation Let Other"
915,00:53:20.42,00:53:20.42,People Crash and Burn. >> Didn't you want us to go get
916,00:53:22.50,00:53:22.50,fruit? >> We're going to get leaves for
917,00:53:24.42,00:53:24.42,the bed. >> What's happening?
918,00:53:25.83,00:53:25.83,What's cracking? Ain't nobody moving.
919,00:53:28.04,00:53:28.04,">> My best plan right now is just to keep my mouth shut, sit"
920,00:53:31.17,00:53:31.17,"on my ass, and watch us self-destruct."
921,00:53:34.33,00:53:34.33,>> The king is restless this morning.
922,00:53:52.33,00:53:52.33,(monkeys squealing) >> I only talked to Jacquie.
923,00:54:02.75,00:54:02.75,">> Oh, really? >> For me, at least, I'm only"
924,00:54:05.25,00:54:05.25,putting my-- I trust Jacquie wholeheartedly.
925,00:54:07.21,00:54:07.21,"She's like my girl, and I trust you."

927,00:54:12.04,00:54:12.04,"great to have, like, a smaller layer of the group."
928,00:54:15.67,00:54:15.67,">> Yeah, I think we have a really good chance."
929,00:54:17.83,00:54:17.83,"I would like the alliance to be, like, me, you, and Jacquie,"
930,00:54:20.04,00:54:20.04,"tight, strong, Charlie, and then just have, like, one, like,"
931,00:54:23.75,00:54:23.75,"like, loser person. >> I think things are kind of"
932,00:54:26.25,00:54:26.25,naturally just going the right direction.
933,00:54:28.83,00:54:28.83,">> Originally when I came in, I really liked Jacquie and I"
934,00:54:30.62,00:54:30.62,really liked Marcus and also Charlie 'cause I feel like
935,00:54:33.17,00:54:33.17,they're really trustworthy. I know that that's only four and
936,00:54:35.79,00:54:35.79,"that leaves five out, but that's a short-term thing."
937,00:54:38.12,00:54:38.12,And then we just need a peripheral one extra person to
938,00:54:40.33,00:54:40.33,"be in the majority, and Bob is really benign."
939,00:54:42.71,00:54:42.71,"Like, everyone likes him. >> I think Bob's the best,"
940,00:54:49.54,00:54:49.54,right? >> Right.
941,00:54:51.54,00:54:51.54,>> Bob is our chance. If we can convince Bob that
942,00:54:53.04,00:54:53.04,"going with Ace is not the right way to go, then, like..."
943,00:54:55.29,00:54:55.29,">> I can bring Bob in, like, full-on bring him in."
944,00:54:57.50,00:54:57.50,">> Better situation. >> The only, only problem is I"
945,00:54:59.79,00:54:59.79,don't want to give him too much information.
946,00:55:02.17,00:55:02.17,">> When Corinne, Marcus, Jacquie, and I were out in the"
947,00:55:04.96,00:55:04.96,"forest, it was the first time we ever talked strategy as a"
948,00:55:07.12,00:55:07.12,"foursome. >> If they see us all going off,"
949,00:55:09.46,00:55:09.46,they're probably gonna be like-- everyone is going to get
950,00:55:11.54,00:55:11.54,nervous. >> What should we do?
951,00:55:14.46,00:55:14.46,This is bad business. Let's go back.
952,00:55:16.92,00:55:16.92,>> It was like magic. It was like one brain working as
953,00:55:18.58,00:55:18.58,one. It was amazing.
954,00:55:20.54,00:55:20.54,I really think we're on the same page here.
955,00:55:24.17,00:55:24.17,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa (snoring)
956,00:55:50.62,00:55:50.62,">> Well, I think the morning started some time when the moon"
957,00:55:53.92,00:55:53.92,was right above us. GC had got up earlier.
958,00:55:56.62,00:55:56.62,"I heard this washing machine going, doing lots of, you know,"
959,00:55:59.04,00:55:59.04,"the slushy, slushy, slushy washing machine noises and stuff"
960,00:56:01.08,00:56:01.08,like that. And I thought: just keep it down
961,00:56:04.67,00:56:04.67,so we can all sleep. Otherwise we're going to be
962,00:56:06.04,00:56:06.04,"killed. >> Damn, I'm sweating like"
963,00:56:10.08,00:56:10.08,"crazy. >> I'm sweating like mad, too."
964,00:56:12.17,00:56:12.17,">> And then a second person joined him, and then the talking"
965,00:56:15.96,00:56:15.96,"started and more talking, and more talking, and then"
966,00:56:18.54,00:56:18.54,"Susie joined them, and then that got even louder."
967,00:56:20.88,00:56:20.88,"(laughter) >> Dude, you are the king of"
968,00:56:23.25,00:56:23.25,snoring. >> Gillian was letting it out
969,00:56:25.21,00:56:25.21,last night. >> Was she?
970,00:56:26.54,00:56:26.54,">> I have, I have a request. I'm going to voice my opinion."
971,00:56:30.58,00:56:30.58,"We have all day to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
972,00:56:34.08,00:56:34.08,"blah, blah. Perhaps we could just keep it"
973,00:56:37.25,00:56:37.25,down for certain times during the night.
974,00:56:39.67,00:56:39.67,">> I'm sorry, Gill, but I was, I was woke up, like, early this"
975,00:56:43.67,00:56:43.67,morning because five people were in there snoring.
976,00:56:45.67,00:56:45.67,">> Yeah, I... >> All right?"
977,00:56:46.88,00:56:46.88,So I got up as quietly as I could.
978,00:56:49.21,00:56:49.21,"If other people come out and start talking, don't come out to"
979,00:56:51.04,00:56:51.04,me and say... >> I didn't say...
980,00:56:52.92,00:56:52.92,">> It felt like, it felt like when you came out, you were"
981,00:56:54.88,00:56:54.88,"saying Danny, uh... >> If I wanted to attack you, I"
982,00:56:57.04,00:56:57.04,"would have said, ""Danny, quit flapping your gums at night."""
983,00:57:00.42,00:57:00.42,>> I'm a grown man. Ain't nobody gonna tell me
984,00:57:02.33,00:57:02.33,when I can do something and when I can't.
985,00:57:04.04,00:57:04.04,>> Do you see I didn't tell you what to do?
986,00:57:05.58,00:57:05.58,>> I'm just telling you. >> I just asked.
987,00:57:06.92,00:57:06.92,"I just put in a request-- could we keep the blah, blah, blah"
988,00:57:09.54,00:57:09.54,down. >> We don't need a damn leader.
989,00:57:19.04,00:57:19.04,"I'm younger than all y'all, so what I'm being the leader for?"
990,00:57:22.38,00:57:22.38,"I didn't want to be a leader, I'm not gonna let y'all force me"
991,00:57:24.67,00:57:24.67,to be the leader. So I'm not going to.
992,00:57:27.50,00:57:27.50,">> GC, which stands for ""golden child,"" resigned as"
993,00:57:31.83,00:57:31.83,"leader, which was probably the best leadership call he's made"
994,00:57:37.58,00:57:37.58,since he's been leader because he hasn't led anything.
995,00:57:40.83,00:57:40.83,">> So, Dan, if you want to step up, here's your chance."
996,00:57:44.54,00:57:44.54,"Randy, you want to step up? I mean, you guys say-- if that's"
997,00:57:47.21,00:57:47.21,"what you want, somebody here, somebody else's chance."
998,00:57:50.58,00:57:50.58,"And if nobody says nothing, then that means we don't need a"
999,00:57:52.75,00:57:52.75,leader because obviously nobody wants to be a leader.
1000,00:57:55.17,00:57:55.17,">> He's a leader who quit, who quit this morning."
1001,00:57:58.33,00:57:58.33,It was just the complete opposite reaction that you
1002,00:58:01.62,00:58:01.62,would want from any kind of leader.
1003,00:58:03.17,00:58:03.17,">> If you want to be the leader, man, I'm telling you..."
1004,00:58:05.12,00:58:05.12,>> I-I don't necessarily think my management style would-would
1005,00:58:09.21,00:58:09.21,be good for this tribe. I-I personally don't.
1006,00:58:12.75,00:58:12.75,So I-I prefer not to. Everyone's got their own
1007,00:58:15.71,00:58:15.71,"management style, you know. I-I know I-I'm highly emotional."
1008,00:58:19.38,00:58:19.38,So I'm not sure my-my management style would be any better.
1009,00:58:22.12,00:58:22.12,I would like to be a silent leader.
1010,00:58:24.42,00:58:24.42,"The silent leader is never the one that gets the blame, but he"
1011,00:58:27.00,00:58:27.00,"gets to lead, so that would be a great direction."
1012,00:58:32.92,00:58:32.92,>> We got mail. >> Yeah!
1013,00:58:35.58,00:58:35.58,">> Hey! >> Okay, listen, listen, listen."

1293,01:14:06.42,01:14:06.42,The early hopper catches the fish.
1294,01:14:09.42,01:14:09.42,"With his fishing hook and-and my shoestrings, it's definitely a"
1295,01:14:12.42,01:14:12.42,"group effort. Like, um, this morning, I think"
1296,01:14:14.83,01:14:14.83,"Crystal, Sue, and maybe even Gillian, they all went and"
1297,01:14:19.29,01:14:19.29,"looked for worms, and they found six worms."
1298,01:14:21.92,01:14:21.92,">> Oh, I got another! >> Yeah!"
1299,01:14:25.12,01:14:25.12,">> Yeah, baby. >> Everybody's helping, and it's"
1300,01:14:27.83,01:14:27.83,working out for everybody. >> Don't worry.
1301,01:14:30.62,01:14:30.62,"We'll catch a fish. >> Okay, boys."
1302,01:14:33.04,01:14:33.04,>> Okay. >> Go make Mama proud.
1303,01:14:38.46,01:14:38.46,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Come on, fishes!"
1304,01:14:50.67,01:14:50.67,"Go for the worm. Come on, buddy."
1305,01:14:53.92,01:14:53.92,"You know you want it. Oh, it's a big one."
1306,01:14:57.12,01:14:57.12,">> Oh, it's coming back. It's coming back."
1307,01:14:59.17,01:14:59.17,"Seize it. Okay, pull."
1308,01:15:02.21,01:15:02.21,">> Ow! No, no, no."
1309,01:15:06.21,01:15:06.21,"No, no, no, no. Success!"
1310,01:15:08.21,01:15:08.21,Finally! We caught some damn fish around
1311,01:15:10.38,01:15:10.38,"this place. >> Now, that is meat."
1312,01:15:13.00,01:15:13.00,>> We lost reward challenge that was supposed to get us fishing
1313,01:15:15.79,01:15:15.79,"gear, but we caught fish anyway. We don't need that stuff."
1314,01:15:18.25,01:15:18.25,We're good. We're survival experts.
1315,01:15:22.54,01:15:22.54,>> We got something. We got five sardines.
1316,01:15:25.92,01:15:25.92,">> Let's see 'em. >> Got 'em, y'all."
1317,01:15:28.08,01:15:28.08,">> We got some sardines. >> Oh, yes!"
1318,01:15:30.08,01:15:30.08,Thank you! >> All right!
1319,01:15:32.25,01:15:32.25,>> Thank you! >> It looks good!
1320,01:15:35.67,01:15:35.67,">> Ooh, I can smell 'em. >> Mmm."
1321,01:15:39.04,01:15:39.04,">> Oh, look at that. >> The Fang Tribe has protein,"
1322,01:15:42.83,01:15:42.83,"finally, after six days now, and it feels good."
1323,01:15:54.29,01:15:54.29,">> Oh, it's Dan coming back. >> Oh, good."
1324,01:15:57.08,01:15:57.08,>> All right. >> Man's back.
1325,01:15:59.12,01:15:59.12,>> All right! Come on back.
1326,01:16:02.21,01:16:02.21,>> It's a bad place. >> Welcome back.
1327,01:16:04.92,01:16:04.92,">> No, but it was not-not fun at all."
1328,01:16:07.17,01:16:07.17,Thank you so much. >> How was it?
1329,01:16:09.12,01:16:09.12,>> Did you have fire? >> Did you have any food?
1330,01:16:11.25,01:16:11.25,">> I can't really talk about it. >> Oh. Why, it was so bad?"
1331,01:16:13.17,01:16:13.17,"(mumbling) >> No. I mean, there was a"
1332,01:16:15.21,01:16:15.21,good... I just made the bad choice.
1333,01:16:17.33,01:16:17.33,">> What? >> There's, like, a choice when"
1334,01:16:19.12,01:16:19.12,you get there. >> Oh.
1335,01:16:20.92,01:16:20.92,">> If we have to send one of their tribe members, we need to"
1336,01:16:23.50,01:16:23.50,think about it. >> Yeah.
1337,01:16:25.21,01:16:25.21,">> You send a weak player, they may just quit right there."
1338,01:16:27.21,01:16:27.21,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
1339,01:16:28.92,01:16:28.92,">> I think a weak player... >> You send a strong player,"
1340,01:16:30.88,01:16:30.88,they may find the idol and be even stronger.
1341,01:16:33.12,01:16:33.12,">> True. Plus, a stronger player..."
1342,01:16:34.83,01:16:34.83,>> But I don't know if anyone is going to find that thing.
1343,01:16:37.08,01:16:37.08,"I looked, like, five or six hours."
1344,01:16:39.17,01:16:39.17,">> I figured. I said, ""I bet Dan's is gonna be going all over"
1345,01:16:41.25,01:16:41.25,"the place looking for that."" >> Couldn't find it."
1346,01:16:43.25,01:16:43.25,"I was going berserk. >> Dan's back from Exile Island,"
1347,01:16:45.12,01:16:45.12,"and, uh, he was acting real strange, man."
1348,01:16:48.04,01:16:48.04,"Like, I just don't get this guy. >> Oh, man, it really makes you"
1349,01:16:52.12,01:16:52.12,"rethink, like, your reasons for doing this."
1350,01:16:54.29,01:16:54.29,(laughter) >> I'm guessing that he-he
1351,01:16:56.38,01:16:56.38,"either knows where it is, or Dan has the immunity idol right now."
1352,01:17:00.71,01:17:00.71,">> Yeah, something's fishy with Dan, for sure."
1353,01:17:02.71,01:17:02.71,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. >> Fishy."
1354,01:17:04.75,01:17:04.75,"He either ate, or he's got the idol."
1355,01:17:07.25,01:17:07.25,">> I think Dan is cool. >> Something's up, dude."
1356,01:17:09.62,01:17:09.62,">> If Dan has the immunity idol right now, it affects my game"
1357,01:17:13.17,01:17:13.17,because he will hold the power of the tribe.
1358,01:17:15.58,01:17:15.58,>> The two people on the block right now is Dan or Gillian.
1359,01:17:18.08,01:17:18.08,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
1360,01:17:19.92,01:17:19.92,>> Okay. >> Like-Like 100%...
1361,01:17:21.50,01:17:21.50,>> We cannot trust Dan 100%. >> 50-50.
1362,01:17:23.54,01:17:23.54,>> 100%. >> 50...
1363,01:17:25.46,01:17:25.46,">> Yeah. >> He's definitely got the idol,"
1364,01:17:30.25,01:17:30.25,dude. He's acting too weird.
1365,01:17:32.17,01:17:32.17,>> (laughing): No... >> He's too comfortable.
1366,01:17:34.17,01:17:34.17,>> He's not tripping out like normal.
1367,01:17:36.21,01:17:36.21,">> I think he's just paranoid. I think he's just really,"
1368,01:17:38.58,01:17:38.58,really tired and had a tough night.
1369,01:17:40.92,01:17:40.92,"I really do. >> You don't think he's got it,"
1370,01:17:43.04,01:17:43.04,"dude, you really don't? >> I really don't."
1371,01:17:44.83,01:17:44.83,>> He's coming back. >> He's a smart person.
1372,01:17:46.75,01:17:46.75,I think he has it. >> He's coming back.
1373,01:17:56.25,01:17:56.25,">> Isn't the plan, according to everybody, Gillian?"
1374,01:17:58.75,01:17:58.75,">> What? No. Right now, the way things"
1375,01:18:01.17,01:18:01.17,"seems is, it could be Dan. >> I'd rather have Gillian go."
1376,01:18:05.54,01:18:05.54,">> If you guys decide Dan goes first, I'm definitely going"
1377,01:18:08.21,01:18:08.21,"with you. >> We got to weigh our options,"
1378,01:18:10.33,01:18:10.33,"too. My whole thing is, Dan is smart,"
1379,01:18:12.75,01:18:12.75,and I think that Dan is going to try to...
1380,01:18:15.54,01:18:15.54,>> He's not smart enough. >> He's a lawyer.
1381,01:18:17.54,01:18:17.54,It takes a person with a certain swagger to be a lawyer.
1382,01:18:20.17,01:18:20.17,Not everybody is cut out to be lawyers.
1383,01:18:28.04,01:18:28.04,(snorts) >> PROBST: Catch me up on what's
1384,01:18:47.67,01:18:47.67,"happened in the last few days. Last time I saw you, you"
1385,01:18:50.92,01:18:50.92,decided we need a leader. GC's going to be the leader.
1386,01:18:54.04,01:18:54.04,"How's it going being the leader? >> Well, uh, it was..."
1387,01:18:58.62,01:18:58.62,>> It was? >> It was going all right for a
1388,01:19:01.17,01:19:01.17,"day or two, but my group kind of volunteered me to be the leader,"
1389,01:19:04.33,01:19:04.33,and that's not a position that I want to be in in this game with
1390,01:19:07.54,01:19:07.54,"this tribe. And I told them, you know, I"
1391,01:19:09.92,01:19:09.92,don't want to be the leader of the group.
1392,01:19:12.25,01:19:12.25,">> PROBST: Susie, what happened? >> There was a little conflict"
1393,01:19:14.38,01:19:14.38,"between Gillian, I think. She just wanted to voice her"
1394,01:19:17.12,01:19:17.12,"opinion about something, and GC felt like he was being attacked."
1395,01:19:19.21,01:19:19.21,"So, that's kind of what happened."
1396,01:19:21.21,01:19:21.21,It kind of just fell apart. >> And it definitely doesn't
1397,01:19:23.12,01:19:23.12,mean I'm not helping out. It doesn't mean I'm not giving
1398,01:19:25.46,01:19:25.46,my opinion. It doesn't mean we're not
1399,01:19:27.33,01:19:27.33,working together as a group. It just means that I'm not the
1400,01:19:29.88,01:19:29.88,"one that everybody is looking to for some kind of guidance, which"
1401,01:19:32.50,01:19:32.50,some people just really don't need anyway.
1402,01:19:35.62,01:19:35.62,">> PROBST: Randy, what's the problem right now with the"
1403,01:19:37.96,01:19:37.96,tribe? >> We've got eight individuals.
1404,01:19:40.12,01:19:40.12,Period. I see where GC is coming from.
1405,01:19:42.62,01:19:42.62,"I wouldn't want to lead this bunch, either."
1406,01:19:45.12,01:19:45.12,">> PROBST: Dan, is the problem that there's just too many"
1407,01:19:47.58,01:19:47.58,disruptive forces? I'm up; you're down?
1408,01:19:50.58,01:19:50.58,I'm left; you're right? >> I think it's lack of
1409,01:19:53.08,01:19:53.08,leadership. And I can understand that you
1410,01:19:55.67,01:19:55.67,don't want to be voted off for standing up.
1411,01:19:58.04,01:19:58.04,"I mean, you just kind of made a face and shook your head when I"
1412,01:20:02.04,01:20:02.04,"said that, but that's no different than what Randy just"
1413,01:20:04.21,01:20:04.21,"said. >> And I was, like, ""If you"
1414,01:20:06.21,01:20:06.21,"really feel like we need a leader, how about somebody else"
1415,01:20:08.62,01:20:08.62,"step in, wants to be that person?"""
1416,01:20:10.71,01:20:10.71,"And what did everybody do? >> PROBST: Crystal, are you"
1417,01:20:15.42,01:20:15.42,frustrated that you don't have a leader?
1418,01:20:17.38,01:20:17.38,">> It can be a little bit frustrating, but sometimes, our"
1419,01:20:20.21,01:20:20.21,"day-to-day chores at the house, we don't need a leader."
1420,01:20:22.50,01:20:22.50,"If we see the wood is going low, somebody is going to get"
1421,01:20:25.08,01:20:25.08,up. But when it's time to go to
1422,01:20:27.50,01:20:27.50,"war, Jeff, I'm all about in the zone."
1423,01:20:30.04,01:20:30.04,I need to hear about how we're going to get our heads together
1424,01:20:32.54,01:20:32.54,and how we're going to kick Kota's butt.
1425,01:20:34.58,01:20:34.58,>> I agree there. It's the strategies and the
1426,01:20:36.88,01:20:36.88,discipline and the challenges that we need to pull together
1427,01:20:40.29,01:20:40.29,"on, and we all need to agree. Otherwise, we're doomed."
1428,01:20:44.96,01:20:44.96,">> PROBST: GC, tell me about camp life."
1429,01:20:47.17,01:20:47.17,"Has it gotten any better? >> It got a little bit better,"
1430,01:20:49.33,01:20:49.33,"man, 'cause, uh, the homie Randy right here made us a fishing"
1431,01:20:52.75,01:20:52.75,"hook. Crystal and Sue, and I think"
1432,01:20:55.00,01:20:55.00,"Gill even, were out getting worms this morning."
1433,01:20:57.04,01:20:57.04,"And me and Kenny hopped on the boat, and we caught, like, five"
1434,01:20:59.92,01:20:59.92,"fish. They were small, but, hey, it"
1435,01:21:01.79,01:21:01.79,helped out a lot. It made us feel a lot better.
1436,01:21:04.38,01:21:04.38,">> PROBST: Dan, tell me about Exile Island."
1437,01:21:06.79,01:21:06.79,">> It's a... It's a tough place. I mean, it's a good opportunity,"
1438,01:21:10.25,01:21:10.25,but it can really mess with your mind a little bit.
1439,01:21:13.21,01:21:13.21,Searching for that idol comes with its price because you
1440,01:21:16.12,01:21:16.12,could spend all day looking for the idol and not find it.
1441,01:21:20.04,01:21:20.04,"So, it can play that trick on you a little bit, being out"
1442,01:21:22.62,01:21:22.62,"there. >> PROBST: Matt, are you at all"
1443,01:21:24.92,01:21:24.92,concerned over whether Dan may have found the hidden immunity
1444,01:21:27.67,01:21:27.67,"idol already? >> Yeah, there's a little"
1445,01:21:29.92,01:21:29.92,"concern. >> PROBST: Crystal, did you guys"
1446,01:21:32.04,01:21:32.04,talk about it? >> You know we did!
1447,01:21:34.79,01:21:34.79,"(laughter) Okay, it's bound to happen."
1448,01:21:38.46,01:21:38.46,"Yes, we talked, and I think Dan is a very smart gentleman."
1449,01:21:42.75,01:21:42.75,And I think you got the idol. (laughing): That's just my
1450,01:21:45.25,01:21:45.25,thing. I think you found it.
1451,01:21:47.17,01:21:47.17,"But, you know, as limited... as limited clues..."
1452,01:21:49.67,01:21:49.67,">> I don't see any idol in there, sister."
1453,01:21:52.12,01:21:52.12,>> It's fine. It's limited clues.
1454,01:21:53.79,01:21:53.79,>> I-I don't lie. I just don't lie.
1455,01:21:55.67,01:21:55.67,>> I don't discount anyone or anytng in this gam
1456,01:21:59.29,01:21:59.29,>> I don't have the idol. I wish I did.
1457,01:22:01.79,01:22:01.79,"So don't try and flush it out, please!"
1458,01:22:04.21,01:22:04.21,I don't want to go home. >> PROBST: All right.
1459,01:22:09.08,01:22:09.08,"It is time to vote. Dan, you're up."
1460,01:22:21.25,01:22:21.25,">> You're a sweet woman, but I think this is where the"
1461,01:22:24.17,01:22:24.17,"group's going. For all I know, it could be me."
1462,01:22:49.21,01:22:49.21,>> My vote tonight is for Kenny. He just doesn't get a clue a lot
1463,01:22:52.21,01:22:52.21,"of the time. So, good luck, Kenny."
1464,01:23:08.33,01:23:08.33,">> Sorry. I wish it wasn't you, but it is."
1465,01:23:18.83,01:23:18.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
1466,01:23:33.08,01:23:33.08,">> PROBST: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you"
1467,01:23:35.58,01:23:35.58,"want to play it, now would be the time to do so."
1468,01:23:40.67,01:23:40.67,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
1469,01:23:43.21,01:23:43.21,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
1470,01:23:45.58,01:23:45.58,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
