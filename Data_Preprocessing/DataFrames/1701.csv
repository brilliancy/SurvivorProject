442,00:25:12.08,00:25:12.08,my head.I didn't know if it was three
443,00:25:14.00,00:25:14.00,stitches or 30 stitches.I knew it was bleeding a lot.
444,00:25:16.46,00:25:16.46,But leaving this game is not anoption.
445,00:25:19.38,00:25:19.38,And I am petrified that thisinjury could take me out of the

453,00:25:53.96,00:25:53.96,"The doctors were great.I think it only took, like, two"
454,00:25:56.67,00:25:56.67,or three stitches.I don't know.
455,00:25:58.17,00:25:58.17,And they put this huge bandageon it.
456,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,"But it's better today than itwas yesterday, which means it"
457,00:26:05.25,00:26:05.25,will be fine in a couple days.>> I'm supposed to be on the
