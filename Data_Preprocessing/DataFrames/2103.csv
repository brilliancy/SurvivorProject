595,00:26:39.50,00:26:39.50,FOR A CHANGE IN THIS TRIBE.
596,00:26:41.08,00:26:41.08,I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I'M LOOKINGFORWARD TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
597,00:26:45.29,00:26:45.29,WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO GETTHIS TRIBE TO PLAY THIS GAME.
598,00:26:48.17,00:26:48.17,THIS IS REAL AND IT STARTS NOW.
599,00:27:23.25,00:27:23.25,>> I THINK HE'S TRYINGIN HIS OWN LITTLE WAY.
600,00:27:26.25,00:27:26.25,"HIS KNEES AND HIS BACK,YOU KNOW, HE'S..."
601,00:27:28.42,00:27:28.42,"HE'S IN TOUGH SHAPE, YOU KNOW?"
602,00:27:30.54,00:27:30.54,">> WELL, Y'ALL GOTTO HAVE A STRONG TEAM."
603,00:27:34.58,00:27:34.58,>> I'M WORRIEDABOUT JIMMY JOHNSON.
604,00:27:36.38,00:27:36.38,I THINK HE'S FULL OF IT.
605,00:27:37.92,00:27:37.92,"I MEAN, JUST PLAYING LIKE,HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN."
606,00:27:40.71,00:27:40.71,I DON'T BUY THAT.
607,00:27:42.25,00:27:42.25,SO I NEED TO REMOVE HIM SO THATPEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR DADDY.
608,00:27:46.17,00:27:46.17,THEY'LL EITHER SHAKE AND CRUMBLEOR THEY'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME.
609,00:28:09.04,00:28:09.04,">> NO, I'M GOOD. WHATEVER."
610,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,"IN MY MIND, DANNY, COACH ANDHOLLY ARE THE SAME PERSON."
611,00:28:15.29,00:28:15.29,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ORDER.
612,00:28:16.21,00:28:16.21,>> I DISAGREE.
613,00:28:17.88,00:28:17.88,I THINK HE'S MORE STRATEGIC THANEITHER ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS.
614,00:28:20.88,00:28:20.88,HE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.
615,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,>> YOU COME TO MEAND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
616,00:28:25.29,00:28:25.29,"THE WAY I SEE IT,DANNY, COACH AND HOLLY"
617,00:28:28.08,00:28:28.08,ARE ALL EQUALLY WEAK PLAYERS.
618,00:28:30.21,00:28:30.21,MARTY FOR SOME REASONSEES JIMMY AS A THREAT.
619,00:28:32.58,00:28:32.58,SOMEHOW HE THINKS JIMMY'S GOINGTO WEASEL OR WORM
620,00:28:35.71,00:28:35.71,HIS WAY INTO THE MERGE.
621,00:28:37.00,00:28:37.00,I DON'T REALLY FOLLOWHIS LOGIC OR REASONING.
622,00:28:40.29,00:28:40.29,"AND TO BE HONEST,I WOULD PREFER DAN"
623,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,BECAUSE I THINKHE'S PHYSICALLY THE WEAKEST.
624,00:28:45.00,00:28:45.00,"BUT HE'S LIKE, NO,NO, COACH IS DANGEROUS."
625,00:28:46.75,00:28:46.75,"I WAS LIKE, ""WHATEVER."""
626,00:28:48.71,00:28:48.71,YOU'RE THE PUPPET MASTER.

632,00:29:11.67,00:29:11.67,I'M IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE.
633,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,"I'M IN MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTERPHYSICAL SHAPE THAN HE IS."
634,00:29:17.04,00:29:17.04,"SO WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARSTONIGHT,"
635,00:29:18.71,00:29:18.71,WE'LL KNOW WHETHER I GO HOMEOR JIMMY GOES HOME.
636,00:29:22.00,00:29:22.00,>> ARE WE STICKING TO THE PLANOF THE SAME...
637,00:29:24.25,00:29:24.25,>> YEAH.
638,00:29:26.75,00:29:26.75,GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS?
639,00:29:28.54,00:29:28.54,">> WELL, DO YOU?"
640,00:29:31.29,00:29:31.29,>> (\LAUGHS\)
641,00:29:32.54,00:29:32.54,">> FOR ME IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS,I DON'T KNOW."
642,00:29:33.58,00:29:33.58,WE'RE PROBABLY TALKINGTHE SAME THING?
643,00:29:36.08,00:29:36.08,>> I FEEL BAD FOR THE GUYBECAUSE I LIKE HIM
644,00:29:38.12,00:29:38.12,BUT COACH IT IS FOR ME.
645,00:29:39.96,00:29:39.96,HE WAS NEVER A BIG JIMMY T.FAN ANYWAY.
646,00:29:43.29,00:29:43.29,>> COOL.
647,00:29:47.04,00:29:47.04,THERE'S SOME PEOPLETHAT ARE DEFINITELY SMART.
648,00:29:49.71,00:29:49.71,"ACTUALLY, NOT THAT MANY."
649,00:29:51.38,00:29:51.38,BUT I'VE GOT THE STRATEGY.
650,00:29:53.29,00:29:53.29,JIMMY J.'S GOT TO GO FIRST
651,00:29:56.04,00:29:56.04,AND IT WILL SHAKE THE TRIBETO ITS CORE.
652,00:29:58.50,00:29:58.50,I'VE GOT DANNY SQUARED AWAYAND I'VE GOT JIMMY T.
653,00:30:01.33,00:30:01.33,"I'VE GOT JILL,SHE TOTALLY DEFERS TO ME."
654,00:30:03.42,00:30:03.42,"PEOPLE LIKE JANE AND HOLLY,I MEAN,"
655,00:30:06.33,00:30:06.33,LOOK AT JIMMY JOHNSONAS IF HE WERE THE POPE.
656,00:30:09.25,00:30:09.25,SO THAT...
657,00:30:10.67,00:30:10.67,JUST PEOPLE BEING STUPID.
658,00:30:21.62,00:30:21.62,>> DAMN I WANTED A PIECEOF PINEAPPLE AND BANANA.
659,00:30:25.96,00:30:25.96,>> I KNOW MY HEAD'S ONTHE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR TONIGHT.
660,00:30:28.25,00:30:28.25,>> I DON'T THINK SO.
661,00:30:32.54,00:30:32.54,>> NOBODY BROUGHT UP MY NAME?
662,00:30:35.12,00:30:35.12,SO YOU'RE SAYINGIF MY NAME COMES UP
663,00:30:36.42,00:30:36.42,YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME?
664,00:30:37.42,00:30:37.42,>> I WILL TELL YOU.
665,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,>> SO WHO ARE YOU WRITING DOWN?
666,00:30:41.50,00:30:41.50,>> I HAVE A FEELINGIT MIGHT BE DANNY.
667,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,>> WHO?
668,00:30:45.50,00:30:45.50,>> DANNY.
669,00:30:48.71,00:30:48.71,I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEETHE WEAKEST PLAYER GO HOME.
670,00:30:52.08,00:30:52.08,I DON'T KNOW IF DANNY'S HAVINGTHAT GREAT OF A TIME.
671,00:30:54.75,00:30:54.75,"HE'S GOT AN INJURED LEG, OKAY?"
672,00:30:58.04,00:30:58.04,SPIRITS ARE GETTING A LITTLE LOWWITH THE LACK OF FOOD.
673,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,"COACH IS KIND OFMY FISHING BUDDY,"
674,00:31:04.33,00:31:04.33,SO I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM TO GOAT THIS POINT.
675,00:31:06.71,00:31:06.71,"I REALLY DON'T WANT DAN TO GOEITHER,"
676,00:31:09.50,00:31:09.50,BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
677,00:31:11.83,00:31:11.83,I DO NOT LIKE GOINGTO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

683,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,>> IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE.
684,00:31:35.38,00:31:35.38,WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
685,00:31:38.08,00:31:38.08,>> YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENSAT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
686,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,">> YEAH, I KNOW."
687,00:31:42.12,00:31:42.12,I SAID ALL ALONG I JUST WANT ONEOF Y'ALL TO WIN A MILLION BUCKS.

692,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,I THINK I'M GOINGTO GO BACK UP THERE.
693,00:31:58.71,00:31:58.71,>> OKAY.
694,00:32:02.58,00:32:02.58,>> I WANT TO KEEPPLAYING THE GAME.
695,00:32:04.46,00:32:04.46,IT'S THE TOUGHEST THINGI'VE EVER GONE THROUGH.
696,00:32:06.25,00:32:06.25,"I'VE GONE THROUGH TWO A DAYPRACTICES,"
697,00:32:08.58,00:32:08.58,"THREE A DAY PRACTICES, BOTHAS A COACH AND AS A PLAYER,"
698,00:32:12.00,00:32:12.00,AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS.
699,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,NOTHING COMPARES TO IT.
700,00:32:39.75,00:32:39.75,>> MARTY'S PARANOID.
701,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,I THINK THAT MARTY'S VERY MUCHABOUT MARTY.
702,00:32:43.96,00:32:43.96,"I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET,BUT JIMMY JOHNSON'S LIFE"
703,00:32:46.38,00:32:46.38,HAS BEEN ABOUT MOTIVATINGAND LEADING MEN.
704,00:32:49.21,00:32:49.21,I'M WORRIEDABOUT DANNY'S PHYSICAL ABILITY
705,00:32:51.08,00:32:51.08,TO HELP THE TEAM.

708,00:32:57.83,00:32:57.83,BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE BECAUSEI GOT SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
709,00:32:59.58,00:32:59.58,>> ALL RIGHT.
710,00:33:01.08,00:33:01.08,THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT AREKIND OF SHYING AWAY
711,00:33:02.67,00:33:02.67,FROM MAKING THE TOUGH CALLS.
712,00:33:04.62,00:33:04.62,TYRONE'S ANSWER WAS NOWHERE NEARWHAT I NEEDED IT TO BE.
713,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,IT SHOWS HE'S NOT THINKINGTHIS GAME THROUGH AT ALL.
714,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.
715,00:33:14.75,00:33:14.75,"I'D LIKE JIMMY JOHNSON GONE,"
716,00:33:16.33,00:33:16.33,"AND THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAYWITH ME AND WANT TO PLAY ALONG,"

787,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,AND MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANTTO BE BOTHERED WITH THAT.
788,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,IT COULD BE THAT SIMPLE.
789,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,">> Jeff: TYRONE,WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR?"
