137,00:07:21.04,00:07:21.04,KEEP HIM AROUND BECAUSE HE'S FUNNY.
138,00:07:23.00,00:07:23.00,IT'S LIKE...
139,00:07:24.12,00:07:24.12,HERMIT CRAB ON MY FOOT.

149,00:07:44.33,00:07:44.33,AND I KNEW THE FIRST TIME I LAID EYES ON HIM
150,00:07:46.42,00:07:46.42,THAT I WASN'T GOING TO LIKE HIM.
151,00:07:48.67,00:07:48.67,HIS HAIR GOT ON MY NERVES!
152,00:07:50.00,00:07:50.00,SUCH AN AIR HEAD.

163,00:08:31.54,00:08:31.54,SO WE'LL PLAY IT WHEN WE REALLY THINK WE NEED IT.
164,00:08:34.33,00:08:34.33,>> THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND MOVE YOU MADE RIGHT THERE
165,00:08:36.62,00:08:36.62,STRENGTHENED THIS TRIBE BY ABOUT FIVE TIMES.
166,00:08:39.08,00:08:39.08,MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU.
167,00:08:41.25,00:08:41.25,(\\APPLAUSE\\) WAY TO GO.

170,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,WHEN MARTY ANNOUNCED HE FOUND THE IDOL AND WANTED TO SHARE IT
171,00:08:48.46,00:08:48.46,WITH THE TRIBE SO THE TRIBE COULD USE IT TOGETHER
172,00:08:50.54,00:08:50.54,AGAINST THE YOUNG KIDS I WAS LIKE WHAT A GUY!
173,00:08:52.21,00:08:52.21,WAY TO GO MARTY.
174,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67,I'M THINKING HE'S A NICE GUY.
175,00:08:55.17,00:08:55.17,I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT FOR MYSELF BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT US
176,00:08:58.83,00:08:58.83,"CARRYING THAT KIND OF POWER INTER A MERGE SITUATION,"
177,00:09:01.21,00:09:01.21,WE BECOME INVINCIBLE.

184,00:09:15.50,00:09:15.50,LIKE A SUPERSTAR SO IT'S GOOD FOR ME IN THE LONG RUN.
185,00:09:18.21,00:09:18.21,THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
186,00:09:21.21,00:09:21.21,">> WHEN MARTY TOLD EVERYONE HE FOUND THE IDOL,"
187,00:09:23.88,00:09:23.88,"MAYBE HE WANTED SOME INTEGRITY POINTS, TEAM POINTS"
188,00:09:26.88,00:09:26.88,"BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD PERCEIVE IT THAT, HEY, HE'S A TEAM PLAYER,"
189,00:09:30.21,00:09:30.21,ON BOARD WITH WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO.
190,00:09:32.08,00:09:32.08,I THINK MARTY'S SHADY.
191,00:09:33.71,00:09:33.71,I THINK HE'S FOR SURE DOING HIS OWN THING.
192,00:09:36.25,00:09:36.25,>> MARTY COULD HAVE EASILY KEPT THAT IN HIS POCKET AND NOT TOLD
193,00:09:39.29,00:09:39.29,ANY OF US AND BEEN IN A HUGE POSITION OF POWER INDIVIDUALLY.
194,00:09:42.46,00:09:42.46,HE JUST KEPT US STRONG AS A TRIBE.
195,00:09:44.42,00:09:44.42,"THANK YOU, MARTY."
196,00:09:45.58,00:09:45.58,I MEAN THAT.
197,00:09:47.12,00:09:47.12,>> IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE A SECRET
198,00:09:48.33,00:09:48.33,FOR LONG THAT I HAD THE IDOL.
199,00:09:49.79,00:09:49.79,THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY IT WAS TO MAKE IT APPEAR

593,00:26:32.17,00:26:32.17,>> OKAY.
594,00:26:34.54,00:26:34.54,>> IT WAS A HEATED DISCUSSION AND KIND OF ENJOYABLE
595,00:26:38.12,00:26:38.12,JUST TO WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
596,00:26:39.50,00:26:39.50,FOR A CHANGE IN THIS TRIBE.
597,00:26:41.08,00:26:41.08,I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
598,00:26:45.29,00:26:45.29,WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO GET THIS TRIBE TO PLAY THIS GAME.
599,00:26:48.17,00:26:48.17,THIS IS REAL AND IT STARTS NOW.
600,00:27:23.25,00:27:23.25,>> I THINK HE'S TRYING IN HIS OWN LITTLE WAY.
601,00:27:26.25,00:27:26.25,"HIS KNEES AND HIS BACK, YOU KNOW, HE'S..."
602,00:27:28.42,00:27:28.42,"HE'S IN TOUGH SHAPE, YOU KNOW?"
603,00:27:30.54,00:27:30.54,">> WELL, Y'ALL GOT TO HAVE A STRONG TEAM."
604,00:27:34.58,00:27:34.58,>> I'M WORRIED ABOUT JIMMY JOHNSON.
605,00:27:36.38,00:27:36.38,I THINK HE'S FULL OF IT.
606,00:27:37.92,00:27:37.92,"I MEAN, JUST PLAYING LIKE, HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN."
607,00:27:40.71,00:27:40.71,I DON'T BUY THAT.
608,00:27:42.25,00:27:42.25,SO I NEED TO REMOVE HIM SO THAT PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR DADDY.
609,00:27:46.17,00:27:46.17,THEY'LL EITHER SHAKE AND CRUMBLE OR THEY'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME.
610,00:28:09.04,00:28:09.04,">> NO, I'M GOOD. WHATEVER."
611,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,"IN MY MIND, DANNY, COACH AND HOLLY ARE THE SAME PERSON."
612,00:28:15.29,00:28:15.29,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ORDER.
613,00:28:16.21,00:28:16.21,>> I DISAGREE.
614,00:28:17.88,00:28:17.88,I THINK HE'S MORE STRATEGIC THAN EITHER ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS.
615,00:28:20.88,00:28:20.88,HE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.
616,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,>> YOU COME TO ME AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
617,00:28:25.29,00:28:25.29,"THE WAY I SEE IT, DANNY, COACH AND HOLLY"
618,00:28:28.08,00:28:28.08,ARE ALL EQUALLY WEAK PLAYERS.
619,00:28:30.21,00:28:30.21,MARTY FOR SOME REASON SEES JIMMY AS A THREAT.
620,00:28:32.58,00:28:32.58,SOMEHOW HE THINKS JIMMY'S GOING TO WEASEL OR WORM
621,00:28:35.71,00:28:35.71,HIS WAY INTO THE MERGE.
622,00:28:37.00,00:28:37.00,I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW HIS LOGIC OR REASONING.
623,00:28:40.29,00:28:40.29,"AND TO BE HONEST, I WOULD PREFER DAN"
624,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,BECAUSE I THINK HE'S PHYSICALLY THE WEAKEST.
625,00:28:45.00,00:28:45.00,"BUT HE'S LIKE, NO, NO, COACH IS DANGEROUS."
626,00:28:46.75,00:28:46.75,"I WAS LIKE, ""WHATEVER."""
627,00:28:48.71,00:28:48.71,YOU'RE THE PUPPET MASTER.
628,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,">> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT."
629,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17,"NO MORE TALK ABOUT IT, THEN."
630,00:29:05.17,00:29:05.17,>> MARTY AND I ARE VERY SOLID.
631,00:29:07.46,00:29:07.46,I THINK THE NEXT ONE TO GO IS GOING TO BE JIMMY.
632,00:29:10.38,00:29:10.38,"I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM."
633,00:29:11.67,00:29:11.67,I'M IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE.
634,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,"I'M IN MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER PHYSICAL SHAPE THAN HE IS."
635,00:29:17.04,00:29:17.04,"SO WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS TONIGHT,"
636,00:29:18.71,00:29:18.71,WE'LL KNOW WHETHER I GO HOME OR JIMMY GOES HOME.
637,00:29:22.00,00:29:22.00,>> ARE WE STICKING TO THE PLAN OF THE SAME...
638,00:29:24.25,00:29:24.25,>> YEAH.
639,00:29:26.75,00:29:26.75,GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS?
640,00:29:28.54,00:29:28.54,">> WELL, DO YOU?"
641,00:29:31.29,00:29:31.29,>> (\\LAUGHS\\)
642,00:29:32.54,00:29:32.54,">> FOR ME IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS, I DON'T KNOW."
643,00:29:33.58,00:29:33.58,WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING THE SAME THING?
644,00:29:36.08,00:29:36.08,>> I FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY BECAUSE I LIKE HIM
645,00:29:38.12,00:29:38.12,BUT COACH IT IS FOR ME.
646,00:29:39.96,00:29:39.96,HE WAS NEVER A BIG JIMMY T. FAN ANYWAY.
647,00:29:43.29,00:29:43.29,>> COOL.
648,00:29:47.04,00:29:47.04,THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE DEFINITELY SMART.
649,00:29:49.71,00:29:49.71,"ACTUALLY, NOT THAT MANY."
650,00:29:51.38,00:29:51.38,BUT I'VE GOT THE STRATEGY.
651,00:29:53.29,00:29:53.29,JIMMY J.'S GOT TO GO FIRST
652,00:29:56.04,00:29:56.04,AND IT WILL SHAKE THE TRIBE TO ITS CORE.
653,00:29:58.50,00:29:58.50,I'VE GOT DANNY SQUARED AWAY AND I'VE GOT JIMMY T.
654,00:30:01.33,00:30:01.33,"I'VE GOT JILL, SHE TOTALLY DEFERS TO ME."
655,00:30:03.42,00:30:03.42,"PEOPLE LIKE JANE AND HOLLY, I MEAN,"
656,00:30:06.33,00:30:06.33,LOOK AT JIMMY JOHNSON AS IF HE WERE THE POPE.
657,00:30:09.25,00:30:09.25,SO THAT...
658,00:30:10.67,00:30:10.67,JUST PEOPLE BEING STUPID.
659,00:30:21.62,00:30:21.62,>> DAMN I WANTED A PIECE OF PINEAPPLE AND BANANA.
660,00:30:25.96,00:30:25.96,>> I KNOW MY HEAD'S ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR TONIGHT.
661,00:30:28.25,00:30:28.25,>> I DON'T THINK SO.
662,00:30:32.54,00:30:32.54,>> NOBODY BROUGHT UP MY NAME?
663,00:30:35.12,00:30:35.12,SO YOU'RE SAYING IF MY NAME COMES UP
664,00:30:36.42,00:30:36.42,YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME?
665,00:30:37.42,00:30:37.42,>> I WILL TELL YOU.
666,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,>> SO WHO ARE YOU WRITING DOWN?
667,00:30:41.50,00:30:41.50,>> I HAVE A FEELING IT MIGHT BE DANNY.
668,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,>> WHO?
669,00:30:45.50,00:30:45.50,>> DANNY.
670,00:30:48.71,00:30:48.71,I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WEAKEST PLAYER GO HOME.
671,00:30:52.08,00:30:52.08,I DON'T KNOW IF DANNY'S HAVING THAT GREAT OF A TIME.
672,00:30:54.75,00:30:54.75,"HE'S GOT AN INJURED LEG, OKAY?"
673,00:30:58.04,00:30:58.04,SPIRITS ARE GETTING A LITTLE LOW WITH THE LACK OF FOOD.
674,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,"COACH IS KIND OF MY FISHING BUDDY,"
675,00:31:04.33,00:31:04.33,SO I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM TO GO AT THIS POINT.
676,00:31:06.71,00:31:06.71,"I REALLY DON'T WANT DAN TO GO EITHER,"
677,00:31:09.50,00:31:09.50,BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
678,00:31:11.83,00:31:11.83,I DO NOT LIKE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
679,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,HATE IT.
680,00:31:15.67,00:31:15.67,(\\LAUGHS\\)
681,00:31:29.83,00:31:29.83,">> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO."
682,00:31:30.83,00:31:30.83,>> BUT...
683,00:31:31.83,00:31:31.83,">> I HOPE NOT, COACH."
684,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,>> IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE.
685,00:31:35.38,00:31:35.38,WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
686,00:31:38.08,00:31:38.08,>> YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
687,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,">> YEAH, I KNOW."
688,00:31:42.12,00:31:42.12,I SAID ALL ALONG I JUST WANT ONE OF Y'ALL TO WIN A MILLION BUCKS.
689,00:31:45.42,00:31:45.42,">> I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE LIKE MY FAVORITE PERSON HERE."
690,00:31:48.00,00:31:48.00,I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO.
691,00:31:50.92,00:31:50.92,>> I'M IN TROUBLE EVERY SINGLE WEEK WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
692,00:31:54.21,00:31:54.21,I KNOW THAT.
693,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,I THINK I'M GOING TO GO BACK UP THERE.
694,00:31:58.71,00:31:58.71,>> OKAY.
695,00:32:02.58,00:32:02.58,>> I WANT TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAME.
696,00:32:04.46,00:32:04.46,IT'S THE TOUGHEST THING I'VE EVER GONE THROUGH.
697,00:32:06.25,00:32:06.25,"I'VE GONE THROUGH TWO A DAY PRACTICES,"
698,00:32:08.58,00:32:08.58,"THREE A DAY PRACTICES, BOTH AS A COACH AND AS A PLAYER,"
699,00:32:12.00,00:32:12.00,AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS.
700,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,NOTHING COMPARES TO IT.
701,00:32:39.75,00:32:39.75,>> MARTY'S PARANOID.
702,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,I THINK THAT MARTY'S VERY MUCH ABOUT MARTY.
703,00:32:43.96,00:32:43.96,"I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET, BUT JIMMY JOHNSON'S LIFE"
704,00:32:46.38,00:32:46.38,HAS BEEN ABOUT MOTIVATING AND LEADING MEN.
705,00:32:49.21,00:32:49.21,I'M WORRIED ABOUT DANNY'S PHYSICAL ABILITY
706,00:32:51.08,00:32:51.08,TO HELP THE TEAM.
707,00:32:52.12,00:32:52.12,DUDE GOT AILMENTS.
708,00:32:55.17,00:32:55.17,YOU RAISE SOME VALID POINTS FOR SURE.
709,00:32:57.83,00:32:57.83,BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE I GOT SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
710,00:32:59.58,00:32:59.58,>> ALL RIGHT.
711,00:33:01.08,00:33:01.08,THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE KIND OF SHYING AWAY
712,00:33:02.67,00:33:02.67,FROM MAKING THE TOUGH CALLS.
713,00:33:04.62,00:33:04.62,TYRONE'S ANSWER WAS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT I NEEDED IT TO BE.
714,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,IT SHOWS HE'S NOT THINKING THIS GAME THROUGH AT ALL.
715,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.
716,00:33:14.75,00:33:14.75,"I'D LIKE JIMMY JOHNSON GONE,"
717,00:33:16.33,00:33:16.33,"AND THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAY WITH ME AND WANT TO PLAY ALONG,"
718,00:33:18.50,00:33:18.50,JUMP ON BOARD.
719,00:33:19.71,00:33:19.71,DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ME.
720,00:33:21.00,00:33:21.00,"I MEAN, I'M PLAYING THIS GAME FOR REAL,"
721,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,AND I'M PLAYING A SMART GAME HERE.
722,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,"I JUST HOPE IT ALL GOES THE WAY I'M PLANNING,"
723,00:33:25.79,00:33:25.79,"'CAUSE THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN,"
724,00:33:26.96,00:33:26.96,AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW.
725,00:33:47.67,00:33:47.67,">> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE, MARTY."
726,00:33:49.75,00:33:49.75,WHAT HAPPENED?
727,00:33:51.29,00:33:51.29,">> WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF LEAD GOING INTO IT, LOST SOME GROUND"
728,00:33:54.29,00:33:54.29,AND JUST COULDN'T PULL IT THROUGH AT THE END.
729,00:33:55.58,00:33:55.58,">> Jeff: JIMMY T., WAS THERE ANY FRUSTRATION"
730,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,ABOUT HOW THINGS WENT DOWN?
731,00:33:58.42,00:33:58.42,WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS? WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT?
732,00:34:00.38,00:34:00.38,">> WELL, AS IS MY WAY,"
733,00:34:01.67,00:34:01.67,"I ALWAYS WANT A LITTLE MORE PLAY TIME,"
734,00:34:03.42,00:34:03.42,SO I TOLD THE COACH RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
735,00:34:05.54,00:34:05.54,"THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WITH ME FOR A WEEK,"
736,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,"I THINK THEY HAVE SEEN MY SKILL SET,"
737,00:34:08.38,00:34:08.38,AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
738,00:34:09.83,00:34:09.83,"I'M NOT GETTING A LITTLE MORE COURT TIME, IF YOU WILL."
739,00:34:11.96,00:34:11.96,">> Jeff: SO YOU LITERALLY WENT TO JIMMY JOHNSON,"
740,00:34:14.12,00:34:14.12,"AND SAID ""PUT ME IN COACH, I'M READY TO PLAY?"""
741,00:34:16.92,00:34:16.92,">> OH, DURING THE GAME, I WAS, LIKE,"
742,00:34:18.42,00:34:18.42,"""YOU'RE WASTING ME HERE, COACH. YOU'RE WASTING ME HERE."""
743,00:34:20.12,00:34:20.12,"AND I THINK HE KNEW IT, AND THAT'S WHY HE DID PUT ME IN."
744,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,HE KNOWS I GOT GAME.
745,00:34:23.79,00:34:23.79,">> Jeff: SO, JILL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE RELYING"
746,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,ON JIMMY JOHNSON FOR SOME STRATEGY AT THESE CHALLENGES.
747,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,">> I MEAN, EVERYBODY HERE IS A LEADER IN THEIR OWN FIELD,"
748,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"WANTS TO PLAY, WANTS TO GO GET HIM,"
749,00:34:34.25,00:34:34.25,AND SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T ALL GEL.
750,00:34:36.21,00:34:36.21,"SO, I GUESS HE'S THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED LEADER"
751,00:34:38.71,00:34:38.71,"OF ALL OF US, SO WE OFTEN LOOK TO HIM."
752,00:34:40.75,00:34:40.75,">> Jeff: SO, JIMMY, IS YOUR BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION"
753,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,HELPING FORM THE STRATEGY OF THE CHALLENGE?
754,00:34:45.67,00:34:45.67,>> I DON'T THINK I'M REALLY FORMING THE STRATEGY
755,00:34:47.71,00:34:47.71,OF THE CHALLENGE.
756,00:34:48.79,00:34:48.79,I THINK I'M LISTENING TO THEM
757,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,AND LETTING THEM MAKE THE CONTRIBUTION.
758,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,"THE OTHER CONTRIBUTION I MAKE IS, I HELP WITH THE FISHING,"
759,00:34:55.88,00:34:55.88,"AND IN THE CHALLENGES, THEY KNOW I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ALL."
760,00:34:58.79,00:34:58.79,">> Jeff: HOLLY, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE"
761,00:35:00.54,00:35:00.54,OF JIMMY JOHNSON'S LEADERSHIP SKILLS.
762,00:35:02.88,00:35:02.88,">> I THINK THERE'S BEEN MANY TIMES HE STEPS FORWARD,"
763,00:35:05.83,00:35:05.83,"AND WHEN WE'RE AROUND THE CAMPFIRE,"
764,00:35:07.71,00:35:07.71,"THERE'S TIMES WHERE HE'LL SAY,"
765,00:35:09.29,00:35:09.29,"""OKAY, WE NEED TO HAVE A TEAM MEETING."""
766,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,HE TRIES TO BOOST THE MORALE AS MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY CAN.
767,00:35:14.62,00:35:14.62,">> Jeff: JIMMY T., YOU LIT UP AND STARTED SMILING."
768,00:35:16.71,00:35:16.71,>> I WAS JUST ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THE ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE.
769,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,>> Jeff: REALLY? JUST EXCITED
770,00:35:20.67,00:35:20.67,"TO HEAR WHAT HOLLY HAD TO SAY, HUH?"
771,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,I GOT TO ASK.
772,00:35:23.71,00:35:23.71,HOW ARE YOU GETTING ALONG WITH JIMMY JOHNSON?
773,00:35:25.67,00:35:25.67,">> WELL, I DON'T THINK ME AND JIMMY HAVE HAD A CHANCE"
774,00:35:27.71,00:35:27.71,TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK.
775,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"I KNOW HE NEVER REALLY APPROACHED ME,"
776,00:35:30.58,00:35:30.58,AND I NEVER REALLY APPROACHED HIM.
777,00:35:32.12,00:35:32.12,">> Jeff: HOW IS IT POSSIBLE,"
778,00:35:33.46,00:35:33.46,"EIGHT DAYS OF LIVING TOGETHER OUT HERE,"
779,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK?
780,00:35:38.92,00:35:38.92,"CELEBRITY ALONE WOULD MAKE MOST PEOPLE SAY,"
781,00:35:41.75,00:35:41.75,"""I'D LIKE TO TALK TO JIMMY JOHNSON."""
782,00:35:44.17,00:35:44.17,>> OF COURSE I'M A BIG FOOTBALL FAN
783,00:35:45.33,00:35:45.33,AND A PATRIOTS SEASON TICKETHOLDER.
784,00:35:47.54,00:35:47.54,"BUT, UM, I DON'T KNOW."
785,00:35:49.25,00:35:49.25,"YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M A THREAT TO HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE"
786,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,"BECAUSE I AM A LEADER WHERE I COME FROM,"
787,00:35:52.46,00:35:52.46,"AND I AM ASSERTIVE, OFTEN SPEAKING MY MIND,"
788,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,AND MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH THAT.
789,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,IT COULD BE THAT SIMPLE.
790,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,">> Jeff: TYRONE, WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR?"
791,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83,>> I... THAT'S... KIND OF BAFFLING TO ME.
792,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,THINKS HE MAY BE A THREAT TO HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE.
793,00:36:08.46,00:36:08.46,I JUST FOUND THAT INTERESTING.
794,00:36:10.46,00:36:10.46,">> Jeff: JIMMY JOHNSON, ARE YOU THREATENED BY JIMMY T.?"
795,00:36:13.25,00:36:13.25,">> NO, AND, ACTUALLY, I FEEL LIKE"
796,00:36:15.12,00:36:15.12,I'VE GOT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH JIMMY T.
797,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,WE NEVER HAVE SAT DOWN ONE ON ONE
798,00:36:19.25,00:36:19.25,"AND HAD LONG CONVERSATIONS,"
799,00:36:20.79,00:36:20.79,BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT IT'S BEEN A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.
800,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,">> Jeff: SO, JILL, YOU'VE LOST THIS CHALLENGE."
801,00:36:27.17,00:36:27.17,HOW MUCH DOES THAT WEIGH ON YOUR MIND
802,00:36:29.04,00:36:29.04,AS THE TRIBE IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER?
803,00:36:31.29,00:36:31.29,>> IT WEIGHS A LOT
804,00:36:32.50,00:36:32.50,"'CAUSE WE'RE GOING UP AGAINST REALLY YOUNG,"
805,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,"STRONG-LOOKING PLAYERS,"
806,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,AND I THINK THAT'S OUR MOTIVATION
807,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,FOR NEEDING THE STRONGEST TRIBE POSSIBLE TO GO UP AGAINST THEM.
808,00:36:40.17,00:36:40.17,">> Jeff: DAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU IS STRONG IN THIS GAME?"
809,00:36:43.38,00:36:43.38,>> I THINK I'M AVERAGE.
810,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,"I'M NOT THE TOP OF THE LADDER,"
811,00:36:46.21,00:36:46.21,BUT I'M NOT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER.
812,00:36:47.58,00:36:47.58,">> Jeff: JILL, IS THAT TRUE?"
813,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,">> WELL, SOMETIMES, AROUND CAMP, DAN SEEMS A LITTLE STIFF,"
814,00:36:54.75,00:36:54.75,AND MAYBE HAVING PROBLEMS LIKE GETTING UP.
815,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,"SO, BEING AN OLDER COMPETITOR, IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW,"
816,00:36:59.96,00:36:59.96,ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT DURING A CHALLENGE?
817,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,">> Jeff: JANE, DO YOU NOTICE DAN STRUGGLING TO GET UP,"
818,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50,"BEING A LITTLE STIFF, AS JILL MENTIONED?"
819,00:37:07.67,00:37:07.67,">> HE'S GOT A BIG SCAR ON ONE OF HIS KNEES,"
820,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME SORT OF KNEE SURGERY.
821,00:37:13.00,00:37:13.00,"SO THAT MIGHT BOTHER HIM GETTING UP AND DOWN, MM-HMM."
822,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,">> Jeff: DAN, ARE YOU AWARE THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU?"
823,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,THEY'RE CHECKING YOU OUT?
824,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,">> YES, BUT I'M THERE, YOU KNOW?"
825,00:37:23.00,00:37:23.00,"I'LL COME UP TO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,"
826,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,"AND IF I DON'T MEET WHAT THEY WANT ME TO DO,"
827,00:37:26.88,00:37:26.88,THEN I'LL BE VOTED OUT.
828,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,"BUT, UH, I'M THERE."
829,00:37:31.96,00:37:31.96,">> Jeff: SO JIMMY T., YOU GET BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE"
830,00:37:34.62,00:37:34.62,KNOWING YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
831,00:37:37.25,00:37:37.25,WHAT WENT DOWN?
832,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,">> I THINK, OVERALL, THE TRIBE IS PLANNING"
833,00:37:40.92,00:37:40.92,ON KEEPING ITS STRONGEST PLAYERS AND REMAINING STRONG.
834,00:37:43.75,00:37:43.75,"THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME ALL THE TIME,"
835,00:37:45.25,00:37:45.25,AND I'M ON BOARD WITH THAT.
836,00:37:46.58,00:37:46.58,"BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HURT ME, SO..."
837,00:37:48.42,00:37:48.42,>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE WEAKER PLAYERS?
838,00:37:50.29,00:37:50.29,>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
839,00:37:51.46,00:37:51.46,>> Jeff: WHO ARE THE WEAK PLAYERS?
840,00:37:53.12,00:37:53.12,">> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO CALL PEOPLE OUT."
841,00:37:54.96,00:37:54.96,"BUT, UM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT."
842,00:37:56.29,00:37:56.29,WE GOT THREE OR FOUR WEAK PLAYERS HERE.
843,00:37:58.08,00:37:58.08,"I'M JUST KEEPING IT REAL, MAN."
844,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,">> Jeff: HOLLY, YOU THINK YOU'RE ONE OF THE WEAK PLAYERS?"
845,00:38:02.12,00:38:02.12,">> NO, I DON'T THINK I AM."
846,00:38:03.42,00:38:03.42,">> Jeff: JANE, ARE YOU ONE OF THE WEAK MEMBERS?"
847,00:38:05.29,00:38:05.29,>> I DON'T THINK SO.
848,00:38:06.54,00:38:06.54,>> Jeff: MARTY?
849,00:38:07.79,00:38:07.79,">> NO, I DON'T THINK SO."
850,00:38:09.00,00:38:09.00,">> Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU, YVE?"
851,00:38:10.08,00:38:10.08,>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
852,00:38:11.33,00:38:11.33,>> Jeff: JILL?
853,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,">> NO, NOT AT ALL."
854,00:38:13.79,00:38:13.79,>> Jeff: TYRONE?
855,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,>> NEGATIVE.
856,00:38:16.29,00:38:16.29,">> Jeff: OKAY, THAT LEAVES TWO PEOPLE."
857,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,"DAN, ARE YOU ONE OF THE WEAKER PLAYERS IN THIS GAME?"
858,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,>> I DON'T THINK I AM.
859,00:38:20.29,00:38:20.29,">> Jeff: YOU DON'T THINK YOU ARE, EITHER."
860,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,"SO JIMMY JOHNSON, ARE YOU ONE OF THE WEAKER PLAYERS IN THIS GAME?"
861,00:38:24.75,00:38:24.75,">> YEAH, I'M THE OLDEST PLAYER, AND ONE OF THE WEAKEST, TOO."
862,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,>> Jeff: SO THE ONLY GUY HERE WHO ADMITS TO THINKING
863,00:38:34.67,00:38:34.67,HE'S ONE OF THE WEAK PLAYERS IS JIMMY JOHNSON.
864,00:38:37.42,00:38:37.42,"SO, TYRONE, YOU GOT TO MAKE A VOTE TONIGHT."
865,00:38:40.75,00:38:40.75,"IS THAT A FREE PASS, VOTE HIM OUT?"
866,00:38:43.42,00:38:43.42,">> UH, THERE'S DEFINITELY OTHER DYNAMICS,"
867,00:38:45.12,00:38:45.12,"BUT YOU ASKED JIMMY JOHNSON A DIRECT QUESTION,"
868,00:38:47.88,00:38:47.88,"AND HE GAVE HIS ANSWER BASED ON A SELF-ASSESSMENT, YOU KNOW."
869,00:38:53.42,00:38:53.42,">> Jeff: MARTY, HOW ABOUT FOR YOU?"
870,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,WHAT'S THE GOAL OF TONIGHT'S VOTE?
871,00:38:57.17,00:38:57.17,">> I THINK IN PART, I'M ANXIOUS"
872,00:38:59.38,00:38:59.38,TO GET THE GAME A LITTLE MORE ACCELERATED
873,00:39:01.79,00:39:01.79,AND A LITTLE MORE ENGAGED.
874,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START THINKING
875,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,"ABOUT ALL THE FACETS OF THIS GAME,"
876,00:39:06.00,00:39:06.00,NOT JUST WEAKEST-STRONGEST CHALLENGES.
877,00:39:07.79,00:39:07.79,THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE.
878,00:39:10.12,00:39:10.12,">> Jeff: MAN, IF I DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT THAT,"
879,00:39:12.75,00:39:12.75,THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS REMIND THEM.
880,00:39:14.42,00:39:14.42,">> WELL, I JUST THINK, IT FEELS AS IF WE'RE DOING A LOT"
881,00:39:17.88,00:39:17.88,"OF SORT OF WAITING AROUND, YOU KNOW?"
882,00:39:19.38,00:39:19.38,"AND NOW, I FEEL THAT THE PACE IS PICKING UP."
883,00:39:21.75,00:39:21.75,"AND CERTAINLY, GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL IS A BIG DRIVER OF THAT."
884,00:39:26.75,00:39:26.75,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME TO VOTE."
885,00:39:29.46,00:39:29.46,"JANE, YOU'RE UP."
886,00:39:46.42,00:39:46.42,">> COACH, YOU SAID YOU'D LISTEN TO EVERYBODY,"
887,00:39:48.29,00:39:48.29,BUT YOU NEVER REALLY LISTENED TO ME.
888,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,"I TRIED TO GIVE MY INPUT, AND IT FELL ON DEAF EARS, SO,"
889,00:39:52.83,00:39:52.83,GO LONG.
890,00:40:19.71,00:40:19.71,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
891,00:40:30.83,00:40:30.83,">> Jeff: ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
892,00:40:33.58,00:40:33.58,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
893,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
894,00:40:36.92,00:40:36.92,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
895,00:40:41.17,00:40:41.17,"FIRST VOTE, JIMMY JOHNSON."
896,00:40:46.79,00:40:46.79,"DANIEL. ONE VOTE JIMMY, ONE VOTE DANIEL."
897,00:40:52.12,00:40:52.12,"JIMMY. THAT'S TWO VOTES JIMMY, ONE VOTE DANIEL."
898,00:40:59.00,00:40:59.00,"JIMMY. THAT'S THREE VOTES JIMMY, ONE VOTE DANIEL."
899,00:41:05.00,00:41:05.00,JIMMY JOHNSON.
900,00:41:06.21,00:41:06.21,"THAT'S FOUR VOTES JIMMY, ONE VOTE DANIEL."
901,00:41:11.29,00:41:11.29,THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA--
902,00:41:13.58,00:41:13.58,JIMMY JOHNSON.
903,00:41:15.75,00:41:15.75,THAT'S FIVE. THAT'S ENOUGH.
904,00:41:17.12,00:41:17.12,YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
905,00:41:25.21,00:41:25.21,"JIMMY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
906,00:41:30.00,00:41:30.00,TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
907,00:41:31.71,00:41:31.71,">> ONE OF YOU, WIN A MILLION BUCKS, OKAY?"
908,00:41:43.17,00:41:43.17,">> Jeff: WELL, IN VOTING OUT JIMMY JOHNSON,"
909,00:41:45.54,00:41:45.54,YOU VOTE OUT A PROVEN LEADER.
910,00:41:48.25,00:41:48.25,"THE QUESTION IS, WHO'S GOING TO STEP UP AND FILL THOSE SHOES?"
911,00:41:51.38,00:41:51.38,"GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO CAMP."
912,00:41:53.21,00:41:53.21,GOOD NIGHT.
913,00:42:08.38,00:42:08.38,STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
914,00:42:14.46,00:42:14.46,>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR...
915,00:42:16.62,00:42:16.62,BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES.
916,00:42:18.29,00:42:18.29,A FIERCE STORM IS ABOUT TO WREAK HAVOC.
917,00:42:21.29,00:42:21.29,>> PUT THE BOXING GLOVES ON.
918,00:42:22.92,00:42:22.92,NOW I'M GOING TO LET YOU HAVE IT.
919,00:42:24.12,00:42:24.12,>> Jeff: GET READY FOR HURRICANE NAONKA.
920,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,>> YOU KNOCKED ME OVER? >> YEAH.
921,00:42:27.83,00:42:27.83,>> I MEAN...
922,00:42:29.29,00:42:29.29,>> I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.
923,00:42:31.58,00:42:31.58,SCREW YOUR LEG. KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE FIRE.
924,00:42:38.42,00:42:38.42,>> I HAD FUN.
925,00:42:39.83,00:42:39.83,BUT I WAS MISERABLE THE WHOLE TIME.
926,00:42:41.33,00:42:41.33,"AND I STILL LOVE THE GAME,"
927,00:42:43.04,00:42:43.04,AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT ADVENTURE.
928,00:42:44.62,00:42:44.62,THIS IS THE MOST STRESSFUL TIME
929,00:42:46.08,00:42:46.08,"I'VE EVER GONE THROUGH IN MY LIFE,"
930,00:42:47.54,00:42:47.54,AND I'M INCLUDING SUPER BOWLS
931,00:42:49.29,00:42:49.29,AND COLLEGIATE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS.
932,00:42:51.33,00:42:51.33,"I INITIALLY SAID, ""KEEP YOUR STRONGEST MEMBERS."""
933,00:42:53.96,00:42:53.96,I OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ONE OF THE STRONGEST MEMBERS.
934,00:42:55.29,00:42:55.29,I THINK THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND BE SUCCESSFUL.
