1081,00:35:19.77,00:35:19.77,I'M VOTING FOR MIKE TONIGHT.
1082,00:35:21.53,00:35:21.53,"WELL, MIKE, HOT SEAT BROTHER."
1083,00:35:25.53,00:35:25.53,I DISRESPECT WHAT JONAS JUST
1084,00:35:28.80,00:35:28.80,DID.
1085,00:35:29.20,00:35:29.20,I DISRESPECT IT DEEPLY.
1086,00:35:31.07,00:35:31.07,"GIVING UP HIS PRINCIPLES,"
1087,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,THROWING MIKE UNDER THE BUS.
1088,00:35:33.63,00:35:33.63,HE DOESN'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR HIS
1089,00:35:35.37,00:35:35.37,LIFE AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT.
1090,00:35:36.07,00:35:36.07,I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING
1091,00:35:37.53,00:35:37.53,ELSE.

1096,00:35:44.57,00:35:44.57,BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE THROWN
1097,00:35:45.80,00:35:45.80,HIMSELF OVER THE BUS.
1098,00:35:47.00,00:35:47.00,THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
1099,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77,DESPITE YOUR BRILLIANT PLAN WE

1104,00:36:01.23,00:36:01.23,IT'S OKAY.
1105,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,"HE'S LAYING, KAT, OKAY?"
1106,00:36:04.13,00:36:04.13,IT'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS
1107,00:36:05.40,00:36:05.40,"YOU GO ON, JONAS."
1108,00:36:06.50,00:36:06.50,YOU DID PROPOSE THAT.
1109,00:36:07.83,00:36:07.83,YOU WANT TO ATTACK ALL OF US
1110,00:36:09.30,00:36:09.30,WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?
1111,00:36:10.07,00:36:10.07,I'M JUST STATING THE FACT.

1113,00:36:14.13,00:36:14.13,VOTE JONAS OUT.
1114,00:36:15.23,00:36:15.23,"HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IT, WE MIGHT"
1115,00:36:16.77,00:36:16.77,AS WELL VOTE HIM OUT.
1116,00:36:18.37,00:36:18.37,I'M SICK OF THIS.
1117,00:36:22.70,00:36:22.70,Jeff: WHY THE BIG REACTION?
1118,00:36:24.00,00:36:24.00,WHAT ARE WE NOT GETTING?
1119,00:36:25.10,00:36:25.10,JONAS HAS BEEN ON MY BACK
1120,00:36:27.10,00:36:27.10,FROM DAY ONE.
1121,00:36:28.03,00:36:28.03,HE'S ALWAYS UNDERMINING ME.
1122,00:36:29.07,00:36:29.07,SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
1123,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,I'M GOING TO GO UP THERE AND PUT
1124,00:36:31.53,00:36:31.53,HIS NAME DOWN.
1125,00:36:32.77,00:36:32.77,I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I'M GOING
1126,00:36:33.87,00:36:33.87,TO DO.
1127,00:36:34.53,00:36:34.53,"I'M SICK OF IT, I HOPE YOU GO"
1128,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,HOME TONIGHT.
1129,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,I'M SICK OF FIGHTING WITH YOU.
1130,00:36:37.70,00:36:37.70,THAT'S FINE.
1131,00:36:38.80,00:36:38.80,BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M
1132,00:36:40.23,00:36:40.23,TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.
1133,00:36:41.10,00:36:41.10,YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT.
1134,00:36:43.90,00:36:43.90,JEFF?
1135,00:36:44.53,00:36:44.53,Jeff: CHELSEA?
1136,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,"ON JONAS' DEFENSE, I THINK"
1137,00:36:47.57,00:36:47.57,MORE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ISSUES AND
1138,00:36:51.20,00:36:51.20,ARGUMENTS WITH TARZAN THAN THEY
1139,00:36:52.53,00:36:52.53,HAVE WITH JONAS.
1140,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,Jeff: SABRINA YOU'RE
1141,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,NODDING YOUR HEAD IN AGREEMENT.
1142,00:36:56.27,00:36:56.27,I'VE HAD A COUPLE RUN-INS
1143,00:36:57.97,00:36:57.97,WITH TARZAN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
1144,00:36:59.53,00:36:59.53,I'M SURE HAS BUT I HAVE HAD ZERO
1145,00:37:01.20,00:37:01.20,ISSUES WITH JONAS.
1146,00:37:03.80,00:37:03.80,Jeff: BUT...
1147,00:37:04.93,00:37:04.93,"THE THING IS, JEFF, IF YOU'RE"
1148,00:37:07.63,00:37:07.63,COMPARING LIKABILITY I ADMIT I'M
1149,00:37:09.30,00:37:09.30,NOT AS LIKABLE AS JONAS.
1150,00:37:11.00,00:37:11.00,I'M AWKWARD OUTSIDE MY
1151,00:37:12.60,00:37:12.60,ENVIRONMENT.
1152,00:37:12.80,00:37:12.80,Jeff: WHAT IS YOUR
1153,00:37:13.73,00:37:13.73,ENVIRONMENT?
1154,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03,MY ENVIRONMENT IS A HOSPITAL
1155,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,AND OPERATING ROOM AND I DO

1160,00:37:23.07,00:37:23.07,Jeff: SO THIS IS A VERY
1161,00:37:24.27,00:37:24.27,DIFFERENT WORLD FOR YOU BECAUSE
1162,00:37:25.43,00:37:25.43,THERE IS NO CAPTAIN OF THIS

1167,00:37:33.73,00:37:33.73,"Jeff: SO, KIM, IT'S VERY"
1168,00:37:36.63,00:37:36.63,INTERESTING WHAT DEVELOPED HERE
1169,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,TONIGHT.
1170,00:37:38.23,00:37:38.23,YOU HAVE JONAS WHO EVERYBODY
1171,00:37:39.27,00:37:39.27,SAYS IS LIKABLE AND PROVIDES.
1172,00:37:41.60,00:37:41.60,HE STIRS THE POT AND OUT COMES

1179,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,I SAID I'M AWKWARD IN IT.
1180,00:37:51.23,00:37:51.23,Jeff: CASE IN POINT.
1181,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,EVEN I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT.
1182,00:37:54.77,00:37:54.77,"THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF A MERGE,"
1183,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,I THINK.
1184,00:37:57.60,00:37:57.60,"YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE"
1185,00:37:59.27,00:37:59.27,LIKE JONAS BECOME A THREAT AND
1186,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,PEOPLE LIKE TARZAN BECOME AN
1187,00:38:02.73,00:38:02.73,ASSET.
1188,00:38:03.07,00:38:03.07,Jeff: DEPEND HOW YOU LOOK
1189,00:38:04.07,00:38:04.07,AT IT.
1190,00:38:04.50,00:38:04.50,SURE.

1192,00:38:07.90,00:38:07.90,WEIGH IN ON THIS?
1193,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,I JUST THINK THERE'S PEOPLE
1194,00:38:10.00,00:38:10.00,YOU WANT TO KEEP AROUND BECAUSE
1195,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,"THEY'RE POSITIVE, THEY'RE"
1196,00:38:12.90,00:38:12.90,"PROVIDERS, THEY HELP OUT SO MUCH"
1197,00:38:14.33,00:38:14.33,AND THEN THERE'S DEAD WEIGHT.
1198,00:38:17.30,00:38:17.30,DID YOU MEAN ME?
1199,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,MAYBE.
1200,00:38:22.47,00:38:22.47,"Jeff: SO, TARZAN, AS THIS"
1201,00:38:24.27,00:38:24.27,TRIBAL HAS EVOLVED ARE YOU
1202,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,CONCERNED IT COULD BE YOU

1204,00:38:29.03,00:38:29.03,I CAME HERE WONDERING WHETHER
1205,00:38:31.33,00:38:31.33,ALLEGIANCES WOULD BE MAINTAINED
1206,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,AND I SENSE WE'VE FALLEN APART.
1207,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,SO THAT MAKES THE WHOLE THING
1208,00:38:39.60,00:38:39.60,TOTALLY MERCURIAL AT THIS POINT
1209,00:38:41.07,00:38:41.07,NOT KNOWING WHICH WAY OR HOW
1210,00:38:42.60,00:38:42.60,IT'S GOING GO.

1213,00:38:48.60,00:38:48.60,I'M VOTING FOR JONAS TONIGHT
1214,00:38:49.73,00:38:49.73,BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID.
1215,00:38:53.43,00:38:53.43,"Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S FIND"

1218,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,YOU CAN NOT VOTE FOR TROYZAN.
1219,00:38:58.33,00:38:58.33,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
1220,00:39:00.10,00:39:00.10,IT IS.
1221,00:39:00.80,00:39:00.80,TIME TO VOTE.
