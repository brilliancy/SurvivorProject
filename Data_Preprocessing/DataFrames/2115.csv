404,00:16:25.83,00:16:25.83,THAT WOULD BE THE OPTIMUM.
405,00:16:26.92,00:16:26.92,IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY
406,00:16:28.29,00:16:28.29,BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO.

413,00:17:00.04,00:17:00.04,THAT'S IT. I SAID MY PIECE.
414,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,>> I KNOW.
415,00:17:06.79,00:17:06.79,I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO MAKE A CASE FOR DAN
416,00:17:09.21,00:17:09.21,"NOT BEING THE BIGGEST THREAT,"
417,00:17:10.62,00:17:10.62,AND THE BEST PERSON FOR ME TO DO THAT WITH IS SASH.
418,00:17:13.29,00:17:13.29,"I HAVE TO HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE,"
419,00:17:15.25,00:17:15.25,"ME AND SASH,"
420,00:17:16.12,00:17:16.12,"WITHOUT CHASE COMING UP AND SAYING,"
421,00:17:18.12,00:17:18.12,"""WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?"""
422,00:17:19.54,00:17:19.54,"BECAUSE HE DOES THAT, AND IT'S ANNOYING."
423,00:17:23.58,00:17:23.58,YOU PERSONALLY?
424,00:17:25.12,00:17:25.12,"BECAUSE THAT COULD BE BAD FOR YOU, MAN."
425,00:17:27.92,00:17:27.92,>> I KNOW.
426,00:17:29.29,00:17:29.29,>> I'M TRYING TO GET A REAL SENSE
427,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00,FOR HOW YOU'RE FEELING.
428,00:17:32.17,00:17:32.17,>> I KNOW CHASE...
429,00:17:33.58,00:17:33.58,"I MEAN, CHASE HAS EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO HOLLY."
430,00:17:35.38,00:17:35.38,">> IF HOLLY AND CHASE END UP IN THAT FINAL THREE TOGETHER,"
431,00:17:38.29,00:17:38.29,I THINK THEY WOULD TAKE ALL THE VOTES.
432,00:17:40.17,00:17:40.17,>> YOU AND I COULD VOTE HOLLY TONIGHT
433,00:17:42.12,00:17:42.12,AND NOT EVEN LET IT COME DOWN TO CHASE.
434,00:17:44.08,00:17:44.08,>> THAT'S TRUE.
435,00:17:45.21,00:17:45.21,FABIO BROUGHT UP A LOT OF GOOD POINTS.
436,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GIVING DAN
437,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,"A LITTLE TOO MUCH CREDIT FOR BEING A THREAT,"
438,00:17:51.25,00:17:51.25,BUT HOLLY IS A THREAT
439,00:17:52.88,00:17:52.88,BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN LEFT IN THE GAME
440,00:17:54.71,00:17:54.71,AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW WOMEN ON THE JURY.
441,00:17:56.79,00:17:56.79,"NOT ONLY THAT,"
442,00:17:58.25,00:17:58.25,HOLLY COULD GET ALL THE VOTES
443,00:18:00.96,00:18:00.96,FROM ALL THE FORMER ESPADA MEMBERS.
444,00:18:02.92,00:18:02.92,>> SO I'M NOT TRYING TO SAVE DAN.
445,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,I'M JUST TRYING TO SPLIT UP CHASE
446,00:18:06.50,00:18:06.50,AND HOLLY WHILE WE CAN.
447,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,>> I LIKE THE IDEA.
448,00:18:09.50,00:18:09.50,YOU BRING UP GOOD POINTS.
449,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,"AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,"
450,00:18:13.42,00:18:13.42,IT'S TRANSITIONED FROM AN ALLIANCE-TYPE GAME
451,00:18:17.33,00:18:17.33,"TO AN INDIVIDUAL GAME,"
452,00:18:19.04,00:18:19.04,AND EVERYONE IS TRYING
453,00:18:21.42,00:18:21.42,TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
454,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,AND I AM AS WELL.
455,00:18:28.92,00:18:28.92,">> WE'RE THINKING DAN, OF COURSE."
456,00:18:31.08,00:18:31.08,>> YOU'RE WHAT?
457,00:18:32.83,00:18:32.83,>> DAN.
458,00:18:33.92,00:18:33.92,>> WE WERE JUST THINKING ABOUT DAN.
459,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,>> I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU WERE IN
460,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,FOR VOTING HIM OFF.
461,00:18:38.25,00:18:38.25,I THOUGHT...
462,00:18:39.38,00:18:39.38,>> YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT.
463,00:18:41.17,00:18:41.17,">> YEAH, I KNOW,"
464,00:18:42.29,00:18:42.29,"BUT WE WERE TALKING, AND I THOUGHT MY NAME CAME UP."
465,00:18:44.83,00:18:44.83,SO THAT'S ONLY THING I WAS THINKING.
466,00:18:48.33,00:18:48.33,I HAVE A FEELING
467,00:18:50.29,00:18:50.29,THAT DAN AND FABIO ARE TELLING SASH AND CHASE
468,00:18:53.71,00:18:53.71,"THAT I'M A HUGE THREAT,"
469,00:18:55.29,00:18:55.29,THAT THEY NEED TO GET RID OF ME.
470,00:18:57.88,00:18:57.88,AM I CONCERNED AT THIS POINT?
471,00:18:59.29,00:18:59.29,ABSOLUTELY.
472,00:19:00.29,00:19:00.29,BUT I JUST HAVE TO TRUST IN MY ALLIANCE
473,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,AND HOPE THAT TONIGHT
474,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,MY NAME ISN'T WRITTEN DOWN.
475,00:19:21.83,00:19:21.83,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
476,00:19:23.08,00:19:23.08,THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
477,00:19:27.08,00:19:27.08,ALINA.
478,00:19:28.17,00:19:28.17,MARTY.
479,00:19:29.25,00:19:29.25,BRENDA.
480,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,NAONKA.
481,00:19:32.21,00:19:32.21,PURPLE KELLY.
482,00:19:33.54,00:19:33.54,BENRY.
483,00:19:34.96,00:19:34.96,AND JANE VOTED OUT
484,00:19:36.25,00:19:36.25,AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
485,00:19:40.25,00:19:40.25,LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
486,00:19:43.54,00:19:43.54,"FABIO, HOW BIG WAS TODAY'S WIN FOR YOU?"
487,00:19:46.42,00:19:46.42,">> TODAY WAS A BIG ONE, MAN."
488,00:19:48.08,00:19:48.08,WINNING IMMUNITY
489,00:19:49.38,00:19:49.38,IS A HUGE PART OF GETTING
490,00:19:50.88,00:19:50.88,TO THE END OF THIS GAME.
491,00:19:52.12,00:19:52.12,>> Jeff: HOW BIG A FACTOR IS TONIGHT'S VOTE
492,00:19:54.38,00:19:54.38,"FROM THE POINT OF ""WHO CAN I BEAT?"""
493,00:19:56.21,00:19:56.21,>> TONIGHT'S VOTE IS GOING TO COME DOWN
494,00:19:58.38,00:19:58.38,TO WHO PEOPLE THINK IS THE THREAT FOR THE MILLION
495,00:20:00.67,00:20:00.67,BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT OF THE GAME WE'RE AT.
496,00:20:02.83,00:20:02.83,YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO'S ON THE JURY?
497,00:20:04.79,00:20:04.79,WHO HAS HAD PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM?
498,00:20:06.83,00:20:06.83,WHO THEY MAYBE RESPECT
499,00:20:08.96,00:20:08.96,FOR CERTAIN REASONS
500,00:20:10.08,00:20:10.08,AND WHO HAS PLAYED A NICE GAME?
501,00:20:12.92,00:20:12.92,">> Jeff: DAN, A BIG PART OF YOUR STRATEGY"
502,00:20:16.08,00:20:16.08,"FROM DAY ONE HAS BEEN ""TAKE ME TO THE END."
503,00:20:19.21,00:20:19.21,"I CAN'T POSSIBLY WIN."""
504,00:20:20.71,00:20:20.71,>> CORRECT.
505,00:20:21.79,00:20:21.79,>> Jeff: STILL FEEL THAT WAY?
506,00:20:23.12,00:20:23.12,>> I LIVE A NICE LIFE.
507,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,I HAVE MONEY.
508,00:20:26.67,00:20:26.67,AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
509,00:20:28.17,00:20:28.17,"IS GOING TO AWARD ME A MILLION DOLLARS, EVER."
510,00:20:30.46,00:20:30.46,>> Jeff: DOES THAT SEEM FAIR TO YOU?
511,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,>> I'M NOT SAYING I COULDN'T USE THE MILLION DOLLARS.
512,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,"I'M NOT MAKING LIGHT OF A MILLION DOLLARS, OKAY."
513,00:20:35.88,00:20:35.88,BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE
514,00:20:38.17,00:20:38.17,THAT THEY WOULD SOONER GIVE IT TO.
515,00:20:39.92,00:20:39.92,"I ALWAYS SAID, ""TAKE ME THERE."
516,00:20:41.88,00:20:41.88,"I'M NEVER GOING TO WIN."""
517,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,THAT WAS MY PLOY THE WHOLE WAY HERE.
518,00:20:45.29,00:20:45.29,">> Jeff: SASH, IF YOU BUY INTO THAT,"
519,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENT.
520,00:20:49.29,00:20:49.29,>> IT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT
521,00:20:50.92,00:20:50.92,BECAUSE IT INCREASES YOUR ODDS
522,00:20:53.38,00:20:53.38,FROM 33% TO 50%
523,00:20:55.38,00:20:55.38,OR EVEN 100%.
524,00:20:56.92,00:20:56.92,">> Jeff: HOLLY, AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
525,00:20:59.12,00:20:59.12,THERE WERE A LOT OF FINGERS POINTING AT YOU.
526,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,">> THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF TONIGHT, ALSO."
527,00:21:03.08,00:21:03.08,I KNOW THAT DAN HAS TALKED TO SASH
528,00:21:05.67,00:21:05.67,ABOUT TEAMING UP WITH THE GUYS
529,00:21:07.50,00:21:07.50,AND GETTING RID OF ME.
530,00:21:08.62,00:21:08.62,>> Jeff: WHY WOULD THAT MAKE SENSE?
531,00:21:10.21,00:21:10.21,>> BECAUSE DAN SAID HE WOULD LIKE
532,00:21:11.96,00:21:11.96,FOUR GUYS TO GO TO THE FINAL FOUR.
533,00:21:13.71,00:21:13.71,>> I DON'T THINK I EVER SAID
534,00:21:16.21,00:21:16.21,I WANT FOUR GUYS TO GO.
535,00:21:17.21,00:21:17.21,THE REASON WHY HOLLY WOULD BE VOTED OUT
536,00:21:18.92,00:21:18.92,IS BECAUSE SHE'S A THREAT.
537,00:21:20.08,00:21:20.08,I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS COMES FROM.
538,00:21:21.92,00:21:21.92,>> HOW AM I A THREAT?
539,00:21:23.29,00:21:23.29,EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU THINK I'M A THREAT.
540,00:21:25.29,00:21:25.29,">> THE LADY FROM SOUTH DAKOTA,"
541,00:21:26.96,00:21:26.96,"1,100 PEOPLE IN HER TOWN."
542,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,SHE'S IN THE FINAL THREE.
543,00:21:30.38,00:21:30.38,THAT'S A THREAT.
544,00:21:32.12,00:21:32.12,>> WHY IS THAT A THREAT
545,00:21:33.71,00:21:33.71,WHERE I'M FROM
546,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,AND HOW MANY PEOPLE I HAVE IN MY TOWN?
547,00:21:36.88,00:21:36.88,>> THAT'S MY INTERPRETATION.
548,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,I JUST THINK IT IS.
549,00:21:39.12,00:21:39.12,>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S A THREAT AT ALL.
550,00:21:40.75,00:21:40.75,">> OKAY, I THINK IT IS."
551,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,">> Jeff: OBVIOUSLY, HOLLY,"
552,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S NOT A THREAT.
553,00:21:44.83,00:21:44.83,"WHAT MATTERS IS NOT WHETHER DAN IS RIGHT OR WRONG,"
554,00:21:47.08,00:21:47.08,IT'S THAT'S HIS PERCEPTION.
555,00:21:49.12,00:21:49.12,>> CORRECT.
556,00:21:51.46,00:21:51.46,">> Jeff: CHASE, AT THIS POINT,"
557,00:21:52.88,00:21:52.88,"IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO PERCEPTION, DOESN'T IT?"
558,00:21:55.67,00:21:55.67,>> IT'S A CONSTANT MIND GAME.
559,00:21:58.25,00:21:58.25,THEY OVER THERE KNOW MY MIND'S ALWAYS TURNING.
560,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,I THINK BRENDA CALLED ME PARANOID.
561,00:22:03.17,00:22:03.17,"MY MIND'S ALWAYS THINKING, LIKE,"
562,00:22:06.08,00:22:06.08,HOW TO WIN IN THE END.
563,00:22:08.29,00:22:08.29,SO IT'S ALWAYS A MIND GAME GOING ON.
564,00:22:11.12,00:22:11.12,">> Jeff: SO, HOLLY,"
565,00:22:12.21,00:22:12.21,WHAT DO YOU SAY TO GET THAT TARGET
566,00:22:14.00,00:22:14.00,OFF YOUR BACK AND BACK ON HIS?
567,00:22:15.58,00:22:15.58,>> HAS HE BEEN AGGRESSIVE?
568,00:22:17.54,00:22:17.54,HAS HE GONE OUT AND TALKED TO PEOPLE?
569,00:22:19.46,00:22:19.46,HAS HE MADE THE RIGHT ALLIANCES?
570,00:22:21.67,00:22:21.67,BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
571,00:22:24.21,00:22:24.21,TO REMEMBER THE NUMBERS IN THE JURY.
572,00:22:27.38,00:22:27.38,"BY ASSESSING WHO IS GOING TO GET THE LEAST AMOUNT OF VOTES,"
573,00:22:30.75,00:22:30.75,OF COURSE THAT'S THE PERSON YOU WANT TO TAKE.
574,00:22:32.58,00:22:32.58,SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THOSE ASPECTS INTO CONSIDERATION
575,00:22:35.12,00:22:35.12,WHEN YOU'RE THIS CLOSE TO THE END.
576,00:22:37.42,00:22:37.42,">> Jeff: HOLLY, THOSE ATTRIBUTES YOU MENTIONED,"
577,00:22:39.96,00:22:39.96,HOW AGGRESSIVE WAS HE OR WASN'T HE?
578,00:22:42.08,00:22:42.08,WHAT ALLIANCES DID HE OR DIDN'T HE HAVE?
579,00:22:44.00,00:22:44.00,THOSE ALL SEEM TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT
580,00:22:46.21,00:22:46.21,TO TAKE HIM TO THE END.
581,00:22:47.75,00:22:47.75,"HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO EARN THE MONEY,"
582,00:22:49.33,00:22:49.33,WHICH IS DAN'S POINT EXACTLY.
583,00:22:51.08,00:22:51.08,"FABIO, IF YOU JUST ISOLATE IT"
584,00:22:53.96,00:22:53.96,"DOWN TO HOLLY AND DAN TONIGHT,"
585,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,IT'S POTENTIALLY A MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE
586,00:22:58.42,00:22:58.42,IF YOU VOTE THE WRONG PERSON OUT.
587,00:23:00.25,00:23:00.25,">> UM, YEAH."
588,00:23:01.71,00:23:01.71,"IT DEFINITELY IS,"
589,00:23:03.21,00:23:03.21,AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'M SURE WE ALL THOUGHT ABOUT
590,00:23:05.29,00:23:05.29,THIS AFTERNOON AT CAMP.
591,00:23:06.25,00:23:06.25,A LOT OF THE REASONS THAT HOLLY POINTED OUT
592,00:23:08.96,00:23:08.96,ABOUT DAN BEING A THREAT
593,00:23:10.79,00:23:10.79,IS ALSO WHY HOLLY MAY BE A THREAT AS WELL.
594,00:23:13.08,00:23:13.08,I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE WOMEN ON THE JURY
595,00:23:16.21,00:23:16.21,"RESPECT HOLLY AS A MOTHERLY FIGURE,"
596,00:23:18.38,00:23:18.38,AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF HER ANSWERS
597,00:23:20.54,00:23:20.54,AT TRIBAL COUNCIL ARE PRETTY GOOD.
598,00:23:22.04,00:23:22.04,THAT'S A COMPLIMENT TO HOLLY.
599,00:23:23.75,00:23:23.75,I THINK SHE'S A PRETTY COOL LADY.
600,00:23:25.50,00:23:25.50,">> Jeff: IT'S A COMPLIMENT,"
601,00:23:27.21,00:23:27.21,"AND IT'S ALSO A WARNING, HOLLY."
602,00:23:30.75,00:23:30.75,"ALL RIGHT, FABIO,"
603,00:23:32.12,00:23:32.12,YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AGAIN.
604,00:23:34.21,00:23:34.21,YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT?
605,00:23:35.12,00:23:35.12,>> YEAH.
606,00:23:36.25,00:23:36.25,>> Jeff: CANNOT VOTE FOR FABIO.
607,00:23:37.38,00:23:37.38,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
608,00:23:39.21,00:23:39.21,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
609,00:23:40.75,00:23:40.75,"CHASE, YOU'RE UP."
610,00:24:19.17,00:24:19.17,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
611,00:24:31.88,00:24:31.88,"ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ,"
612,00:24:32.92,00:24:32.92,THE DECISION IS FINAL.
613,00:24:34.12,00:24:34.12,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE
614,00:24:35.33,00:24:35.33,THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
615,00:24:36.71,00:24:36.71,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
616,00:24:40.75,00:24:40.75,"FIRST VOTE, DAN."

678,00:27:41.79,00:27:41.79,"BUT IF FABIO LOSES, HE'LL BE GOING HOME"
679,00:27:45.12,00:27:45.12,BECAUSE HE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MY END GAME.

697,00:28:40.21,00:28:40.21,AND IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
698,00:28:45.96,00:28:45.96,WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DISCUSS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
699,00:28:47.96,00:28:47.96,BECAUSE NUMBER-WISE... I THINK SASH WOULD GET A LOT OF VOTES.
700,00:28:52.67,00:28:52.67,">> PURPLE KELLY WOULD GO SASH,"
701,00:28:54.46,00:28:54.46,DAN AND BENRY WOULD GO SASH.

713,00:29:30.83,00:29:30.83,AND FABIO COULD BE BREAKING THAT UP
714,00:29:32.33,00:29:32.33,IF HE WINS ANOTHER IMMUNITY.
715,00:29:34.00,00:29:34.00,"YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE A MILLION-DOLLAR CHALLENGE FOR ME,"

822,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
823,00:33:24.33,00:33:24.33,>> JILL.
824,00:33:26.00,00:33:26.00,">> SHE WAS GOOD IN THE CHALLENGES,"
825,00:33:27.25,00:33:27.25,BUT I DON'T THINK SHE MADE ENOUGH OF AN IMPACT
826,00:33:29.42,00:33:29.42,ON THE NEW LA FLOR TRIBE TO STICK AROUND.
827,00:33:31.71,00:33:31.71,>> I EXPECTED SURVIVING
828,00:33:34.29,00:33:34.29,IN THE ELEMENTS TO BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT.
829,00:33:36.29,00:33:36.29,I FIGURED THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
830,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,I WOULD DO VERY WELL AT.
831,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,"WHAT I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE, HOWEVER,"
832,00:33:41.62,00:33:41.62,IS THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF THE GAME
833,00:33:43.29,00:33:43.29,WOULD BE EQUALLY DIFFICULT.
834,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,CLEARLY MY SOCIAL GAME WASN'T UP TO SNUFF.
835,00:33:50.29,00:33:50.29,>> ALINA.
836,00:33:51.79,00:33:51.79,">> PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST OVERALL COMPETITORS IN THE GAME,"
837,00:33:53.96,00:33:53.96,I THINK.
838,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,>> I'D RATHER BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE I'M A THREAT
839,00:33:58.04,00:33:58.04,THAN TO BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE I'M DISPENSABLE.
840,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,SO THAT MAKES ME PROUD OF MY GAME
841,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,THAT I WAS THAT BIG OF A THREAT THAT THEY HAD TO GET RID OF ME.
842,00:34:06.25,00:34:06.25,>> MARTY.
843,00:34:07.25,00:34:07.25,>> MARTY.
844,00:34:08.25,00:34:08.25,">> THAT GUY ALWAYS HAD, LIKE,"
845,00:34:09.67,00:34:09.67,"THE MASTER PLAN, YOU KNOW."
846,00:34:11.21,00:34:11.21,>> YEAH.
847,00:34:12.29,00:34:12.29,>> ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT NUMBERS.
848,00:34:13.62,00:34:13.62,>> BIG STRATEGIST.
849,00:34:14.71,00:34:14.71,>> MARTY.
850,00:34:16.25,00:34:16.25,>> I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT MY STRATEGY
851,00:34:18.54,00:34:18.54,"WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE LYING, CHEATING, AND STEALING,"
852,00:34:20.75,00:34:20.75,"AND AS IT TURNS OUT, I NEVER LIED ONCE."
853,00:34:22.58,00:34:22.58,"I NEVER REALLY MADE ANY PROMISES I COULDN'T KEEP,"
854,00:34:25.29,00:34:25.29,SO I LOVED THE WAY I PLAYED THE GAME.
855,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,>> BRENDA.
856,00:34:32.12,00:34:32.12,">> GREAT STRATEGIST IN THE GAME, AND ALMOST A MASTERMIND."
857,00:34:35.04,00:34:35.04,SO ONE OF THE BEST OVERALL PLAYERS IN THE GAME.
858,00:34:38.79,00:34:38.79,>> YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW STRONG YOU ARE
859,00:34:42.71,00:34:42.71,UNTIL YOU'RE TESTED WITH THINGS
860,00:34:44.38,00:34:44.38,"LIKE NOT EATING, NOT SLEEPING,"
861,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,"DEALING WITH ALL THESE PERSONALITIES,"
862,00:34:48.25,00:34:48.25,AND I WAS REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF
863,00:34:50.88,00:34:50.88,"BECAUSE I STAYED FOCUSED,"
864,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,AND I'VE COME OUT OF THIS A NEW PERSON.
865,00:34:59.17,00:34:59.17,>> NAONKA.
866,00:35:01.08,00:35:01.08,">> 11 DAYS LEFT,"
867,00:35:02.54,00:35:02.54,AND TO WALK OUT OF THE GAME...
868,00:35:04.50,00:35:04.50,>> SHE HAD AN IDOL IN HER HAND WHEN SHE QUIT.
869,00:35:06.38,00:35:06.38,>> DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTING.
870,00:35:07.79,00:35:07.79,">> I QUIT THE GAME,"
871,00:35:09.79,00:35:09.79,"AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY THAT,"
872,00:35:11.33,00:35:11.33,BUT I ALWAYS HAD A SMILE.
873,00:35:12.96,00:35:12.96,I WAS FRIENDLY.
874,00:35:14.29,00:35:14.29,AND I HAD A VERY STRATEGICAL GAME.
875,00:35:16.92,00:35:16.92,"I'M NOT TRYING TO TOOT MY OWN HORN,"
876,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,"BUT I WAS LITERALLY THE SMARTEST PLAYER IN THE GAME,"
877,00:35:22.46,00:35:22.46,"HANDS DOWN,"
878,00:35:24.08,00:35:24.08,AND THE CRAZIEST.
879,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,>> ANOTHER QUITTER.
880,00:35:31.54,00:35:31.54,PURPLE KELLY.
881,00:35:33.42,00:35:33.42,>> PURPLE KELLY.
882,00:35:34.75,00:35:34.75,>> PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HER
883,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,TO BE VOTED OUT THAN TO QUIT.
884,00:35:37.75,00:35:37.75,">> MY REPUTATION IS NOT A QUITTER,"
885,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,"AND PEOPLE BACK HOME, THEY ALL KNOW THAT."
886,00:35:42.58,00:35:42.58,SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME
887,00:35:44.29,00:35:44.29,"TO BE SEEN WALKING AWAY FROM SOMETHING,"
888,00:35:46.12,00:35:46.12,BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.
889,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,SO THAT'S THE WORST PART.
890,00:35:53.12,00:35:53.12,>> BENRY.
891,00:35:54.21,00:35:54.21,HUGE PHYSICAL THREAT.
892,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,">> YEAH, HE WAS A GAME PLAYER, MAN."
893,00:35:56.38,00:35:56.38,HE WAS GOOD.
894,00:35:57.46,00:35:57.46,>> THEY WERE SMART TO GET RID OF ME
895,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
896,00:36:02.54,00:36:02.54,THAT I COULD HAVE WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
897,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,"THE NEXT THREE, FOUR, HOWEVER MANY CHALLENGES."
898,00:36:07.71,00:36:07.71,UNLESS THERE WERE SOME PUZZLES INVOLVED.
899,00:36:13.54,00:36:13.54,>> JANE.
900,00:36:14.71,00:36:14.71,>> IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON THAT DESERVES
901,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,TO BE GIVEN A MILLION DOLLARS FOR HOW HARD THEY WORKED
902,00:36:17.71,00:36:17.71,"AND STUFF, IT'S JANE."
903,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,">> I'VE HAD A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN MY LIFE,"
904,00:36:21.79,00:36:21.79,BUT I ALWAYS KNEW I COULD PROBABLY OUT-DO ANY PERSON
905,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,OUT HERE AS FAR AS STAMINA
906,00:36:27.21,00:36:27.21,AND I PROVED TO MYSELF I COULD.
907,00:36:29.21,00:36:29.21,I CAN GO BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH.
908,00:36:36.12,00:36:36.12,>> DAN THE MAN.
909,00:36:37.17,00:36:37.17,>> DAN.
910,00:36:38.54,00:36:38.54,">> TWICE OUR AGE, SO TO MAKE IT THIS LONG IN THE GAME?"
911,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,JUST AN INCREDIBLE FEAT.
912,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,">> GOOD JOB, DAN."
913,00:36:44.21,00:36:44.21,">> I LEARNED THAT THIS CITY BOY CAN SURVIVE IN THE WILDERNESS,"
914,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,AND THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE HAS CHANGED ME
915,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,THAT I WON'T BE SUCH A BEATCH
916,00:36:53.21,00:36:53.21,IF I DON'T GET MY THREE MEALS A DAY ANYMORE.
917,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,I THINK I'M GOING TO BE A LOT LESS SPOILED
918,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,WHEN I GET BACK IN NEW YORK.
919,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,">> Y'ALL, WE MADE IT."
920,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33,>> THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED US GET THERE.
921,00:37:09.12,00:37:09.12,>> RIGHT.
922,00:37:10.29,00:37:10.29,>> I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY RESPECT THAT.
923,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,>> SURE.
924,00:37:12.29,00:37:12.29,>> ABSOLUTELY.
925,00:37:14.29,00:37:14.29,>> IT FEELS GOOD TO HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR.
926,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,"IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL, MAN."
927,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,"IT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT, YOU KNOW."
928,00:37:19.67,00:37:19.67,AND NOW I'VE JUST GOT TO BE THINKING
929,00:37:22.12,00:37:22.12,OF THIS NEXT CHALLENGE
930,00:37:23.29,00:37:23.29,AND HOW THE MILLION DOLLARS
931,00:37:24.79,00:37:24.79,IS ACTUALLY ON THE LINE THIS TIME.
932,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,IT FEELS GOOD TO EVEN BE IN A POSITION
933,00:37:29.38,00:37:29.38,TO COMPETE IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
934,00:37:59.12,00:37:59.12,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS."
935,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
936,00:38:12.25,00:38:12.25,>> YEAH.
937,00:38:14.12,00:38:14.12,>> ABSOLUTELY.
938,00:38:15.25,00:38:15.25,>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
939,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,"FABIO, ONCE AGAIN, I WILL TAKE IT BACK."
940,00:38:25.92,00:38:25.92,"FOR THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT TIME,"
941,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
942,00:38:32.25,00:38:32.25,"FOR YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,"
943,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,YOU WILL EACH HAVE A SWORD.
944,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,WITH ONE HAND YOU WILL BALANCE
945,00:38:38.38,00:38:38.38,THE SWORD ON A SHIELD.
946,00:38:40.08,00:38:40.08,"WITH YOUR OTHER HAND,"
947,00:38:41.54,00:38:41.54,YOU WILL STACK COINS ON THE HANDLE OF THE SWORD.
948,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"AS THE STACK OF COINS GETS HIGHER,"
949,00:38:47.88,00:38:47.88,IT WILL GET MORE DIFFICULT TO BALANCE.
950,00:38:50.08,00:38:50.08,"WHEN THE STACK BECOMES TOO HIGH,"
951,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,THE COINS WILL FALL.
952,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
953,00:38:55.50,00:38:55.50,"LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS IMMUNITY,"
954,00:38:59.29,00:38:59.29,"IS GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL THREE,"
955,00:39:02.25,00:39:02.25,AND YOU WILL GET A CHANCE
956,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,TO PLEAD YOUR CASE TO THE JURY
957,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,OF WHY YOU DESERVE THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR
958,00:39:08.62,00:39:08.62,AND THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES WITH IT.
959,00:39:10.33,00:39:10.33,"LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
960,00:39:12.46,00:39:12.46,AND SOMEBODY'S SHOT
961,00:39:13.83,00:39:13.83,AT THE MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE OVER.
962,00:39:17.12,00:39:17.12,MAKE SENSE?
963,00:39:18.21,00:39:18.21,>> YEAH.
964,00:39:19.58,00:39:19.58,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, PICK UP YOUR SWORDS."
965,00:39:22.17,00:39:22.17,FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO
966,00:39:23.71,00:39:23.71,IS FIND A SPOT ON THAT SHIELD THAT FEELS COMFORTABLE
967,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING IT HERE
968,00:39:28.21,00:39:28.21,THROUGHOUT THE CHALLENGE.
969,00:39:31.08,00:39:31.08,"TIME FOR THE FIRST COIN,"
970,00:39:32.67,00:39:32.67,A MEDIUM-SIZED COIN.

972,00:39:39.71,00:39:39.71,"THREE, TWO, ONE."
973,00:39:41.96,00:39:41.96,THAT'S HOW IT WILL WORK.
974,00:39:44.42,00:39:44.42,YOU'LL HAVE A FIVE-SECOND WINDOW
975,00:39:46.25,00:39:46.25,TO GET THE COIN ON
976,00:39:48.17,00:39:48.17,AND GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THERE.
977,00:39:49.75,00:39:49.75,"ALL RIGHT, NEXT COIN WILL BE A LARGE."
978,00:39:53.71,00:39:53.71,"FIVE, FOUR,"
979,00:39:56.96,00:39:56.96,"THREE, TWO, ONE."
980,00:39:59.42,00:39:59.42,EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.
981,00:40:01.46,00:40:01.46,LET'S PUT ANOTHER LARGE ON THERE.
982,00:40:04.17,00:40:04.17,"FIVE, FOUR,"
983,00:40:07.42,00:40:07.42,"THREE, TWO,"
984,00:40:09.79,00:40:09.79,ONE.
985,00:40:11.33,00:40:11.33,SO YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
986,00:40:14.29,00:40:14.29,"AS THAT STACK GETS HIGHER,"
987,00:40:16.04,00:40:16.04,IT'S GOING TO GET MORE DIFFICULT TO BALANCE IT.
988,00:40:29.71,00:40:29.71,EVERY COIN HERE IS SLIGHTLY UNEVEN.
989,00:40:32.54,00:40:32.54,THESE ARE NOT LIKE THE COINS YOU ARE USED TO
990,00:40:35.12,00:40:35.12,THAT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO STACK.
991,00:40:36.79,00:40:36.79,"THESE WERE MADE FOR A ""SURVIVOR"" CHALLENGE,"
992,00:40:40.38,00:40:40.38,THUS DIFFICULT.
993,00:40:52.50,00:40:52.50,"FABIO, VERY CLOSE TO LOSING THAT STACK,"
994,00:40:56.04,00:40:56.04,BUT A NICE RECOVERY.
995,00:41:00.83,00:41:00.83,TIME TO ADD ANOTHER COIN.
996,00:41:02.83,00:41:02.83,YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A MEDIUM COIN.
997,00:41:04.67,00:41:04.67,"DURING THOSE FIVE SECONDS,"
998,00:41:06.54,00:41:06.54,"IF YOU WANT TO READJUST YOUR STACK,"
999,00:41:08.79,00:41:08.79,"IF YOU THINK IT'S LEANING, GO FOR IT."
1000,00:41:10.42,00:41:10.42,THAT IS THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN TOUCH YOUR COINS.
1001,00:41:13.29,00:41:13.29,HERE WE GO.
1002,00:41:15.50,00:41:15.50,"FIVE, FOUR,"

1005,00:41:25.79,00:41:25.79,YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE ANOTHER COIN.
1006,00:41:27.75,00:41:27.75,THIS TIME A LARGE COIN.

1011,00:41:43.54,00:41:43.54,LET'S PLACE A MEDIUM COIN NOW
1012,00:41:47.21,00:41:47.21,ON THIS STACK.
1013,00:41:53.88,00:41:53.88,HOLLY DROPS A COIN.
1014,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,HOLLY IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
1015,00:41:56.75,00:41:56.75,WE ARE DOWN TO THREE:

1023,00:42:15.71,00:42:15.71,CHASE CAN'T DO IT.
1024,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,CHASE IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
1025,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,GENTLY TAKE A SPOT

1122,00:46:48.46,00:46:48.46,AS I'VE BEEN THIS ENTIRE GAME.

1125,00:46:55.79,00:46:55.79,I'LL DO.

1133,00:47:12.83,00:47:12.83,PURPLE KELLY WILL PROBABLY VOTE CHASE.
1134,00:47:14.83,00:47:14.83,"AND, YOU KNOW, IF HOLLY WENT OUT..."
1135,00:47:18.38,00:47:18.38,>> THINK SHE'D VOTE FOR CHASE?
1136,00:47:19.88,00:47:19.88,>> YUP.
1137,00:47:22.58,00:47:22.58,>> MAYBE WE DO NEED TO RETHINK THIS.

1139,00:47:29.54,00:47:29.54,CHASE HAS BEEN THE ONE FLIP-FLOPPING.
1140,00:47:31.00,00:47:31.00,">> WELL, IT'S OUT OF CHASE'S HANDS RIGHT NOW."
1141,00:47:36.67,00:47:36.67,>> ARE YOU OKAY?
1142,00:47:37.92,00:47:37.92,>> YEAH.
1143,00:47:39.21,00:47:39.21,>> IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE ON EDGE.

1145,00:47:42.79,00:47:42.79,"THAT IF ONE OF YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE WON IMMUNITY,"
1146,00:47:45.04,00:47:45.04,I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NEXT TO GO.
1147,00:47:46.88,00:47:46.88,>> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR CHASE.
1148,00:47:48.67,00:47:48.67,"I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW."
1149,00:47:50.79,00:47:50.79,>> WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN HOLLY AND CHASE?
1150,00:47:52.88,00:47:52.88,>> NO.
1151,00:47:55.08,00:47:55.08,I FEEL LIKE
1152,00:47:58.00,00:47:58.00,"YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND IN THE GAME,"
1153,00:47:59.46,00:47:59.46,"AND I GUARANTEE,"
1154,00:48:02.00,00:48:02.00,"I PROMISE YOU,"
1155,00:48:03.08,00:48:03.08,I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT TO ANYONE ELSE HERE.
1156,00:48:05.08,00:48:05.08,I'M SERIOUS.
1157,00:48:07.12,00:48:07.12,>> YEAH?
1158,00:48:08.21,00:48:08.21,COOL.
1159,00:48:22.00,00:48:22.00,>> WHAT DID YOU AND SASH TALK ABOUT?
1160,00:48:23.83,00:48:23.83,>> HE WAS TRYING TO ADD UP THE JURY
1161,00:48:26.00,00:48:26.00,AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO GET A LOT OF VOTES.
1162,00:48:30.75,00:48:30.75,AND IT WAS...
1163,00:48:32.21,00:48:32.21,">> LET'S SIT DOWN, DUDE."
1164,00:48:33.38,00:48:33.38,I'M PISSED THAT SASH WAS TRYING TO GO BEHIND MY BACK
1165,00:48:36.21,00:48:36.21,AND TRYING TO GET ME OUT.
1166,00:48:37.29,00:48:37.29,"WE PROMISED TO EACH OTHER, SASH AND I DID,"
1167,00:48:40.00,00:48:40.00,"THAT WE WOULDN'T GO AFTER EACH OTHER,"
1168,00:48:41.29,00:48:41.29,AND HE GOES AFTER ME LIKE THAT
1169,00:48:42.67,00:48:42.67,AND STARTS TALKING ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK.
1170,00:48:44.00,00:48:44.00,THAT PISSES ME OFF.
1171,00:48:45.12,00:48:45.12,SASH WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
1172,00:48:46.46,00:48:46.46,TO HIMSELF GET FURTHER IN THE GAME.
1173,00:48:47.96,00:48:47.96,"I ALWAYS KIND OF THOUGHT MAYBE HE'S THAT,"
1174,00:48:49.88,00:48:49.88,"BUT NOW THAT FABIO SAID THAT, HE'S DEFINITELY A SNAKE."
1175,00:48:52.08,00:48:52.08,WHAT ALL DID HE SAY?
1176,00:48:53.96,00:48:53.96,">> I ASKED HAD YOU WON TODAY,"
1177,00:48:57.46,00:48:57.46,WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?
1178,00:49:00.54,00:49:00.54,"HE SAID I CAN'T SPEAK FOR CHASE, BUT I WOULD HAVE."
1179,00:49:03.21,00:49:03.21,>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
1180,00:49:04.67,00:49:04.67,THAT PISSES ME OFF
1181,00:49:07.62,00:49:07.62,BECAUSE HE'S JUST BEEN TALKING TO ME WHOLE TIME
1182,00:49:09.50,00:49:09.50,"ABOUT HIM, ME, AND HOLLY GOING TO THE END."
1183,00:49:11.71,00:49:11.71,>> I KNEW IT.
1184,00:49:13.17,00:49:13.17,"THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, MAN."
1185,00:49:14.25,00:49:14.25,I HAD A SNEAKING SUSPICION.
1186,00:49:15.17,00:49:15.17,>> I'M NOT GOING TO... YOU.
1187,00:49:17.04,00:49:17.04,HE WANTED TO TAKE ME AND HOLLY.
1188,00:49:18.75,00:49:18.75,>> I'VE HAD THIS FEELING ABOUT SASH THE WHOLE TIME
1189,00:49:21.08,00:49:21.08,"THAT HE'S WILLING TO TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING,"
1190,00:49:22.58,00:49:22.58,"AND IT GETS TO ME, YOU KNOW."
1191,00:49:24.17,00:49:24.17,"BUT AT THE SAME TIME,"
1192,00:49:25.71,00:49:25.71,"LOOK AT THE POSITION I'M IN,"
1193,00:49:28.29,00:49:28.29,"AND I'M JUST LAUGHING LIKE,"
1194,00:49:29.54,00:49:29.54,"DUDE, I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU,"
1195,00:49:32.29,00:49:32.29,AND YOU DON'T THINK I CAN.
1196,00:49:33.33,00:49:33.33,"AND I GO BACK TO CHASE, AND I TELL HIM,"
1197,00:49:36.00,00:49:36.00,AND HE'S IMMEDIATELY SELLING SASH OUT TO ME.
1198,00:49:38.29,00:49:38.29,"IT'S ALMOST LIKE I JUST WALKED INTO A KITCHEN,"
1199,00:49:41.29,00:49:41.29,"TURNED THE LIGHTS ON,"
1200,00:49:42.67,00:49:42.67,AND ALL THESE LITTLE COCKROACHES
1201,00:49:44.25,00:49:44.25,ARE TRYING TO SCRAMBLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
1202,00:49:46.08,00:49:46.08,"AND THROW SOMEBODY ELSE UNDER THE BUS, YOU KNOW."
1203,00:49:48.08,00:49:48.08,"I MEAN, WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN ME TO THE FINAL THREE,"
1204,00:49:52.17,00:49:52.17,HONESTLY?
1205,00:49:54.25,00:49:54.25,">> IF THEY WOULD HAVE SAID TODAY,"
1206,00:49:56.88,00:49:56.88,"IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WON TODAY,"
1207,00:49:58.42,00:49:58.42,"I HONESTLY THINK IT WOULD BE ME, HOLLY AND SASH."
1208,00:50:01.50,00:50:01.50,">> SO DID I, MAN."
1209,00:50:04.29,00:50:04.29,I KNEW IT.
1210,00:50:05.17,00:50:05.17,>> STRAIGHT UP WITH YOU.
1211,00:50:07.08,00:50:07.08,>> YEP.
1212,00:50:08.08,00:50:08.08,THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
1213,00:50:21.00,00:50:21.00,">> WELL, FABIO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU."
1214,00:50:23.58,00:50:23.58,"THE THREE OF US WERE IN AN ALLIANCE,"
1215,00:50:25.71,00:50:25.71,AND WE WANTED TO GO TO THE END.
1216,00:50:27.33,00:50:27.33,"I DON'T KNOW IF CHASE TOLD YOU THAT,"
1217,00:50:29.17,00:50:29.17,BUT I JUST WANT TO PLEAD MY CASE TO YOU.
1218,00:50:31.25,00:50:31.25,"I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR FINAL DECISION,"
1219,00:50:33.42,00:50:33.42,BUT SASH HAS PLAYED A TREMENDOUS GAME.
1220,00:50:36.46,00:50:36.46,>> YEAH.
1221,00:50:38.00,00:50:38.00,">> STRATEGICALLY,"
1222,00:50:39.17,00:50:39.17,"HE'S PLAYED VERY, VERY WELL."
1223,00:50:41.54,00:50:41.54,AND I JUST WANT YOU TO REALLY SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT IT.
1224,00:50:44.46,00:50:44.46,>> SHE HAS A PRETTY GOOD POINT.
1225,00:50:46.04,00:50:46.04,">> IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT,"
1226,00:50:48.29,00:50:48.29,"BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO VOTES,"
1227,00:50:50.08,00:50:50.08,THAT COULD BE HUGE.
1228,00:50:51.83,00:50:51.83,>> COULD BE DANGEROUS.
1229,00:50:54.25,00:50:54.25,">> SASH AND CHASE HAVE LIED TO ME THE WHOLE TIME,"
1230,00:50:57.12,00:50:57.12,SAYING WE WOULD GO TO THE FINAL THREE TOGETHER.
1231,00:50:59.25,00:50:59.25,AND NOW I REALLY FEEL LIKE
1232,00:51:01.88,00:51:01.88,I ALMOST DON'T WANT TO TAKE EITHER OF THEM.
1233,00:51:04.33,00:51:04.33,HOLLY IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE
1234,00:51:06.29,00:51:06.29,THAT HASN'T LIED OR DONE ANYTHING TO ME.
1235,00:51:08.58,00:51:08.58,I HAVE RESPECTED YOU THIS WHOLE GAME.
1236,00:51:10.54,00:51:10.54,">> YEAH, AND I'VE RESPECTED YOU A LOT."
1237,00:51:12.12,00:51:12.12,>> YEAH.
1238,00:51:13.12,00:51:13.12,I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHO IS ON THE JURY
1239,00:51:15.88,00:51:15.88,AND HOW PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED THE GAME
1240,00:51:17.25,00:51:17.25,"AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY'VE HAD WITH THEM,"
1241,00:51:19.33,00:51:19.33,"AND, YOU KNOW,"
1242,00:51:20.62,00:51:20.62,"WHO WOULD TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM ME,"
1243,00:51:23.29,00:51:23.29,"AND, ALSO, WHO DESERVES TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE."
1244,00:51:26.50,00:51:26.50,"WHO I WANT THERE, YOU KNOW."
1245,00:51:28.08,00:51:28.08,I FEEL LIKE HOLLY HAS PLAYED A PRETTY GOOD GAME
1246,00:51:30.67,00:51:30.67,"AND SHE DOES DESERVE TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE,"
1247,00:51:33.04,00:51:33.04,"BUT THEN AGAIN,"
1248,00:51:34.12,00:51:34.12,"SHE MIGHT DESERVE JURY VOTES, TOO."
1249,00:51:36.58,00:51:36.58,SO I'VE GOT A BIG DECISION TO MAKE
1250,00:51:39.71,00:51:39.71,"ON WHO I WANT TO TAKE,"
1251,00:51:41.50,00:51:41.50,AND IS IT GOING TO COST ME A MILLION DOLLARS OR NOT?
1252,00:51:44.75,00:51:44.75,"SO MY HEAD'S DEFINITELY SPINNING,"
1253,00:51:46.96,00:51:46.96,"YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT."
1254,00:52:18.08,00:52:18.08,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1264,00:52:38.08,00:52:38.08,"FABIO, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN."
1265,00:52:40.21,00:52:40.21,">> YEAH, MAN."
1266,00:52:42.08,00:52:42.08,I FEEL GREAT RIGHT NOW.
1267,00:52:43.50,00:52:43.50,>> Jeff: WE HAVEN'T EVEN SAID A WORD
1268,00:52:45.17,00:52:45.17,AND YOU'RE JUST BURSTING.
1269,00:52:47.12,00:52:47.12,">> YEAH, I'M PRETTY EXCITED, MAN."
1270,00:52:48.83,00:52:48.83,"THIS IS FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL,"

1277,00:53:02.71,00:53:02.71,I DEFINITELY HAVE FELT ON THE OUTS.
1278,00:53:05.17,00:53:05.17,IT WAS FUNNY TO WATCH A THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE
1279,00:53:07.08,00:53:07.08,EACH GIVE THEIR OWN ANGLE
1280,00:53:08.83,00:53:08.83,OF WHY THEY SHOULD BE COMING.
1281,00:53:10.54,00:53:10.54,"IT WAS A FUN AFTERNOON, YES."
1282,00:53:12.58,00:53:12.58,>> Jeff: WHAT WAS SASH'S APPROACH?
1283,00:53:15.38,00:53:15.38,>> SASH WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO TALK TO ME.
1284,00:53:17.50,00:53:17.50,"YOU KNOW, HE IMMEDIATELY SAID,"
1285,00:53:19.12,00:53:19.12,"""WHO DO YOU WANT TO TAKE?"""
1286,00:53:20.33,00:53:20.33,"AND I ASKED HIM,"
1287,00:53:21.83,00:53:21.83,"""IF ONE OF YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE WON TODAY,"
1288,00:53:24.12,00:53:24.12,WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN ME?
1289,00:53:25.42,00:53:25.42,"BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT THAT US THREE GUYS HAD COME TO."""
1290,00:53:29.25,00:53:29.25,"AND HE SAID, ""YEAH, YOU KNOW, FOR SURE, DEFINITELY."""
1291,00:53:33.17,00:53:33.17,"BUT THERE WAS A PART OF ME THAT,"
1292,00:53:35.25,00:53:35.25,"YOU KNOW, KIND OF SAW THROUGH THAT."
1293,00:53:38.12,00:53:38.12,>> Jeff: YOU DIDN'T BUY IT.
1294,00:53:39.25,00:53:39.25,>> NO.
1295,00:53:41.33,00:53:41.33,>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT CHASE?

1300,00:53:49.54,00:53:49.54,"AND HE SAID, ""PROBABLY NOT."""
1301,00:53:52.62,00:53:52.62,"AND I SAID, ""I KNEW IT."""
1302,00:53:55.12,00:53:55.12,"BECAUSE THEY ASKED ME TO GIVE THEM MY WORD ON A PLAN,"
1303,00:53:58.67,00:53:58.67,"AND I DIDN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING IN RETURN,"
1304,00:54:01.75,00:54:01.75,SO IT WAS...
1305,00:54:03.29,00:54:03.29,IT WAS INTERESTING.
1306,00:54:04.33,00:54:04.33,">> Jeff: SASH, WE GET BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE,"

1311,00:54:13.17,00:54:13.17,"WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE NOW,"
1312,00:54:16.25,00:54:16.25,AND WHO WOULD PROBABLY CARRY
1313,00:54:18.38,00:54:18.38,MORE JURY VOTES THAN OTHERS.
1314,00:54:21.50,00:54:21.50,">> Jeff: NOW, FABIO'S GOING TO TELL YOU"
1315,00:54:24.12,00:54:24.12,THAT HE TALKED TO CHASE
1316,00:54:25.21,00:54:25.21,ND CHASE SAYS THAT'S BS.
1317,00:54:26.96,00:54:26.96,">> TRUTH IS, JEFF, I'VE HAD MANY ALLIANCES"
1318,00:54:29.33,00:54:29.33,WITH MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.
1319,00:54:31.38,00:54:31.38,"AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO ADMIT THAT,"
1320,00:54:34.12,00:54:34.12,"AND I THINK OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS,"
1321,00:54:36.62,00:54:36.62,I'VE BEEN MORE COMMITTAL TO YOU THAN CHASE HAS.
1322,00:54:39.83,00:54:39.83,">> SO RIGHT NOW,"
1323,00:54:41.58,00:54:41.58,"IF YOU HAD WON TODAY,"
1324,00:54:42.92,00:54:42.92,"WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN ME TO THE FINAL THREE,"
1325,00:54:44.71,00:54:44.71,LIKE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT?
1326,00:54:48.71,00:54:48.71,>> I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE.
1327,00:54:51.46,00:54:51.46,">> Jeff: WAIT, YOU BELIEVE YOU WOULD HAVE"

1329,00:54:54.88,00:54:54.88,">> WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE THE IDOL,"
1330,00:54:57.08,00:54:57.08,SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION.
1331,00:54:59.12,00:54:59.12,BUT I...
1332,00:55:01.42,00:55:01.42,">> THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW."
1333,00:55:03.83,00:55:03.83,>> IT'S TRUE THAT I DID MAKE AN ALLIANCE
1334,00:55:06.58,00:55:06.58,WITH CHASE AND HOLLY.
1335,00:55:07.62,00:55:07.62,I DID MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH FABIO.
1336,00:55:09.92,00:55:09.92,"I PROMISED TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE IF I WON,"
1337,00:55:12.79,00:55:12.79,I WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE END.
1338,00:55:14.12,00:55:14.12,">> Jeff: HOLLY, WHAT WAS YOUR PITCH TO FABIO?"
1339,00:55:17.71,00:55:17.71,>> FABIO AND I WERE SITTING IN THE HUT.
1340,00:55:20.54,00:55:20.54,"FIRST OF ALL, I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM,"
1341,00:55:23.25,00:55:23.25,"AND I TOLD HIM NUMBER-WISE,"
1342,00:55:25.58,00:55:25.58,"SASH WAS A HUGE THREAT,"
1343,00:55:27.54,00:55:27.54,AND HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.
1344,00:55:30.42,00:55:30.42,"HE ALSO ASKED ME, ""IF I WOULDN'T HAVE WON TODAY,"
1345,00:55:33.58,00:55:33.58,"WOULD I HAVE BEEN VOTED OUT TONIGHT?"""
1346,00:55:35.42,00:55:35.42,AND I SAID YES.
1347,00:55:36.79,00:55:36.79,>> Jeff: SO YOU ALSO TOLD FABIO
1348,00:55:38.17,00:55:38.17,YOU WOULD HAVE VOTED HIM OUT?
1349,00:55:39.46,00:55:39.46,">> YES, I WAS HONEST."
1350,00:55:41.17,00:55:41.17,>> Jeff: SO THAT MEANS THE ONLY PERSON IN QUESTION
1351,00:55:43.96,00:55:43.96,"IS SASH WHEN HE TOLD YOU,"
1352,00:55:45.79,00:55:45.79,"""NO, I WOULD HAVE STUCK WITH YOU."""
1353,00:55:47.08,00:55:47.08,>> YEAH.

1383,00:56:54.62,00:56:54.62,AND I'M GLAD YOU RESPECT ME AND THINK HIGHLY OF ME.
1384,00:56:56.88,00:56:56.88,THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

1446,01:00:49.92,01:00:49.92,LETS THE JURY KNOW I REALLY AM AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON.
1447,01:00:52.88,01:00:52.88,IT'S LIKE WE SAID.

1458,01:01:13.08,01:01:13.08,AND FABIO COULD SAY WHATEVER HE WANTED TO.
1459,01:01:15.17,01:01:15.17,BUT GUNS WILL BE BLAZING TOMORROW.
1460,01:01:17.25,01:01:17.25,"I'M EXCITED TO, YOU KNOW,"
1461,01:01:18.58,01:01:18.58,BRING MY THOUGHTS TOMORROW NOW THAT I KNOW I'M SAFE.

1469,01:01:34.67,01:01:34.67,TO SWITCHING VOTES AROUND.
1470,01:01:36.79,01:01:36.79,AND BETWEEN BEING UNSURE

1473,01:01:42.46,01:01:42.46,IT WAS REALLY A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR ME.

1475,01:01:46.75,01:01:46.75,JUST SMILING AT EACH OTHER.
1476,01:01:48.00,01:01:48.00,">> I WANTED THAT, TOO."

1487,01:02:05.17,01:02:05.17,BECAUSE I REALLY DO FEEL
1488,01:02:08.67,01:02:08.67,AS THOUGH I'VE PLAYED THE BEST STRATEGIC GAME.
1489,01:02:11.25,01:02:11.25,>> TO END UP WITH TWO GUYS WHO ARE JUST AWESOME...

1531,01:03:56.96,01:03:56.96,AND THE MILLION DOLLARS.
1532,01:03:58.17,01:03:58.17,"BUT THEY'VE ALSO BEEN ALLIES OF MINE,"
1533,01:04:00.33,01:04:00.33,"WHICH HAVE HELPED ME GET TO WHERE I'M AT TODAY,"

1543,01:04:15.67,01:04:15.67,BUT FOR ME IT'S COMPLETELY FALSE.
1544,01:04:18.79,01:04:18.79,I'M STILL WORKING THE GAME RIGHT NOW
1545,01:04:20.62,01:04:20.62,TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M GOING TO BEAT THESE GUYS.

1555,01:04:38.12,01:04:38.12,THAT HE'S GOT IT AND GET HIM A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT.
1556,01:04:40.12,01:04:40.12,"IF I CAN GET HIM A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT,"
1557,01:04:42.25,01:04:42.25,THAT CAN HELP ME.

1565,01:05:09.21,01:05:09.21,"AND FOCUS ON TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
1566,01:05:11.50,01:05:11.50,"BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY IN IT TO WIN IT TONIGHT,"
1567,01:05:14.21,01:05:14.21,"YOU'RE GOING TO MISS YOUR CHANCE AT A MILLION DOLLARS,"
1568,01:05:16.96,01:05:16.96,AND THOSE ARE THE LARGEST STAKES I'VE EVER PLAYED FOR.
1569,01:05:19.29,01:05:19.29,SO I'M GOING TO GO
1570,01:05:21.62,01:05:21.62,INTO THIS LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL SWINGING.
1571,01:05:23.88,01:05:23.88,">> YOU READY, FABIO?"

1573,01:05:27.67,01:05:27.67,AND PUT IT ON IN.
1574,01:05:29.83,01:05:29.83,">> I'M DEFINITELY NERVOUS ABOUT FACING THE JURY TONIGHT,"
1575,01:05:32.79,01:05:32.79,BECAUSE I'VE DONE A LOT OF BACKSTABBING.
1576,01:05:34.88,01:05:34.88,I'VE MADE A LOT OF ALLIANCES
1577,01:05:37.54,01:05:37.54,THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP.
1578,01:05:39.46,01:05:39.46,SO I'M GOING TO THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT
1579,01:05:42.50,01:05:42.50,HOPING TO PUT EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TABLE
1580,01:05:44.38,01:05:44.38,"AND BE 100% TRUTHFUL,"
1581,01:05:46.79,01:05:46.79,BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
1582,01:05:48.08,01:05:48.08,I'M GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN THEIR VOTE.
1583,01:05:50.33,01:05:50.33,>> BURN.

1588,01:06:01.21,01:06:01.21,">> TONIGHT, I AM THE UNDERDOG GOING IN."
1589,01:06:03.46,01:06:03.46,I'VE GOT TO PULL OFF AN UPSET.
1590,01:06:05.46,01:06:05.46,I THINK THE MAIN DIFFERENCES
1591,01:06:07.29,01:06:07.29,"IN MINE AND FABIO'S GAME WAS,"
1592,01:06:08.50,01:06:08.50,I ACTUALLY DID HAVE RELATIONSHIPS
1593,01:06:09.92,01:06:09.92,WITH THESE PEOPLE.
1594,01:06:11.17,01:06:11.17,I THINK THAT COULD HELP ME DEFINITELY.
1595,01:06:13.00,01:06:13.00,I THINK I PLAYED A BETTER GAME THAN SASH.
1596,01:06:15.21,01:06:15.21,>> LIBERTAD.
1597,01:06:16.58,01:06:16.58,">> LET IT BURN, BABY!"
1598,01:06:18.46,01:06:18.46,I HAD A HUGE TARGET ON MY BACK
1599,01:06:21.08,01:06:21.08,"FROM THE BEGINNING AS A PHYSICAL THREAT,"
1600,01:06:22.71,01:06:22.71,AND I'M STILL HERE AT THE END.
1601,01:06:24.33,01:06:24.33,"OBVIOUSLY, THAT MEANS I DID SOMETHING RIGHT"
1602,01:06:26.38,01:06:26.38,SO I'M GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT
1603,01:06:28.12,01:06:28.12,"LIKE IT IS A BATTLE,"
1604,01:06:29.46,01:06:29.46,BECAUSE I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
1605,01:06:30.79,01:06:30.79,PLAYING FOR SECOND PLACE IN THIS GAME.
1606,01:07:09.58,01:07:09.58,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN OUR JURY.

1623,01:07:44.38,01:07:44.38,NINE PEOPLE THAT YOU PLAYED ALONGSIDE
1624,01:07:46.29,01:07:46.29,HOLD YOUR FATE IN THEIR HANDS.

1627,01:07:54.21,01:07:54.21,YOU WILL EACH GET A CHANCE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT.
1628,01:07:56.62,01:07:56.62,THEN THE JURY WILL GET
1629,01:07:58.04,01:07:58.04,THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU.

1631,01:08:02.54,01:08:02.54,LET'S GET TO THE OPENING STATEMENTS.
1632,01:08:04.21,01:08:04.21,"CHASE, YOU'RE UP FIRST."
1633,01:08:06.04,01:08:06.04,">> ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL."
1634,01:08:07.88,01:08:07.88,"FIRST OF ALL, OBVIOUSLY,"
1635,01:08:09.08,01:08:09.08,I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR GETTING ME TO WHERE I AM.
1636,01:08:11.29,01:08:11.29,IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO PLAY THE GAME
1637,01:08:12.79,01:08:12.79,WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.
1638,01:08:13.96,01:08:13.96,IT'S BEEN AN HONOR. Y'ALL KNOW THAT.
1639,01:08:15.33,01:08:15.33,"HAVING SAID, THAT, TONIGHT,"
1640,01:08:17.17,01:08:17.17,BRING ON THE QUESTIONS.
1641,01:08:18.21,01:08:18.21,I WANT TO YOU BRING ON THE QUESTIONS.
1642,01:08:19.62,01:08:19.62,I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

1644,01:08:22.33,01:08:22.33,BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU ARE PISSED AT ME.
1645,01:08:24.54,01:08:24.54,A LOT OF YOU SAID I PLAYED A CRAZY GAME.
1646,01:08:26.33,01:08:26.33,I'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH.
1647,01:08:27.33,01:08:27.33,I'VE BEEN WISHY-WASHY.

1649,01:08:30.25,01:08:30.25,AND I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU
1650,01:08:31.75,01:08:31.75,AND TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
1651,01:08:33.17,01:08:33.17,"AND WHY I DID SOME OF THE THINGS I DID IN THIS GAME,"
1652,01:08:35.38,01:08:35.38,SO BRING IT ON. LET'S GO.
1653,01:08:37.38,01:08:37.38,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FABIO."

1655,01:08:40.29,01:08:40.29,>> I ALSO WANT TO SAY I ENJOYED EACH ONE OF YOU.
1656,01:08:42.79,01:08:42.79,I THINK WE ALL HAD A LOT OF GOOD TIMES.
1657,01:08:44.71,01:08:44.71,"PART OF MY STRATEGY WAS TO BE MYSELF TO THE FULLEST,"
1658,01:08:47.67,01:08:47.67,BE AN OPEN BOOK.
1659,01:08:49.08,01:08:49.08,"I KNEW THAT I WAS IN THE CLEAR A LOT OF TIME,"
1660,01:08:51.38,01:08:51.38,AND WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE END
1661,01:08:53.17,01:08:53.17,"AND I REALLY NEEDED TO ASSERT MYSELF,"
1662,01:08:54.71,01:08:54.71,"YOU KNOW, I FELT LIKE I DID THAT."
1663,01:08:56.62,01:08:56.62,"AND WINNING THREE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES IN A ROW,"
1664,01:08:59.04,01:08:59.04,"THAT WAS SURVIVAL MODE, YOU KNOW."
1665,01:09:00.92,01:09:00.92,AND I DESERVE TO BE IN THE FINAL THREE.
1666,01:09:03.00,01:09:03.00,I PLAYED A STAND-UP GAME.
1667,01:09:04.58,01:09:04.58,"I DON'T THINK I BACKSTABBED ANY OF YOU GUYS,"
1668,01:09:06.62,01:09:06.62,AND I JUST THINK I DESERVE A MILLION DOLLARS.
1669,01:09:09.96,01:09:09.96,I COULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN.
1670,01:09:12.17,01:09:12.17,">> Jeff: SASH, YOU'RE UP."
1671,01:09:14.79,01:09:14.79,">> THANKS, JEFF."
1672,01:09:16.21,01:09:16.21,I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING THE GAME WITH EVERYONE.
1673,01:09:17.92,01:09:17.92,AND I PLAYED MUCH DIFFERENTLY THAN BOTH CHASE AND FABIO.
1674,01:09:21.46,01:09:21.46,"REALLY, THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS"
1675,01:09:23.67,01:09:23.67,TO WIN THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
1676,01:09:25.88,01:09:25.88,"THAT'S OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, AND OUTLAST."
1677,01:09:27.96,01:09:27.96,ALL THREE OF US WERE ABLE TO OUTLAST TO DAY 39.
1678,01:09:32.08,01:09:32.08,"SO, REALLY, TONIGHT'S VOTE COMES DOWN TO STRATEGY"
1679,01:09:35.17,01:09:35.17,AND WHO IS ABLE TO OUTWIT AND OUTPLAY.
1680,01:09:37.96,01:09:37.96,"LASTLY, I JUST WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW"
1681,01:09:41.21,01:09:41.21,"THAT THE FRIENDSHIPS THAT I FORMED,"
1682,01:09:43.58,01:09:43.58,I TAKE MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY THAN THE ACTUAL ALLIANCES.
1683,01:09:46.88,01:09:46.88,"ALLIANCES ARE PART OF THE GAME,"
1684,01:09:48.38,01:09:48.38,AND I'M SORRY IF SOME OF THE ALLIANCES WERE BROKEN.
1685,01:09:50.83,01:09:50.83,"BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE GAME,"
1686,01:09:52.83,01:09:52.83,AND I HOPE YOU RESPECT ME FOR THAT.
1687,01:09:55.12,01:09:55.12,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY,"
1688,01:09:58.00,01:09:58.00,YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET YOUR FIRST CHANCE
1689,01:09:59.58,01:09:59.58,"TO ADDRESS CHASE, FABIO, AND SASH."
1690,01:10:03.54,01:10:03.54,I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.
1691,01:10:17.00,01:10:17.00,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY,"
1692,01:10:19.00,01:10:19.00,SOME OF YOU HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME
1693,01:10:20.62,01:10:20.62,FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
1694,01:10:22.25,01:10:22.25,"TO GRILL CHASE, FABIO AND SASH."
1695,01:10:25.67,01:10:25.67,"YOUR JOB TONIGHT,"
1696,01:10:27.54,01:10:27.54,GATHER INFORMATION TO HELP YOU
1697,01:10:29.21,01:10:29.21,MAKE A MILLION-DOLLAR VOTE.
1698,01:10:31.58,01:10:31.58,LET'S GET STARTED.
1699,01:10:33.12,01:10:33.12,"BRENDA, YOU'RE UP FIRST."
1700,01:10:35.54,01:10:35.54,">> HEY, GUYS."
1701,01:10:37.75,01:10:37.75,CONGRATULATIONS.
1702,01:10:39.54,01:10:39.54,"I AM REALLY, REALLY, REALLY PROUD OF YOU GUYS."
1703,01:10:42.79,01:10:42.79,"SASH, I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING WITH YOU."
1704,01:10:45.79,01:10:45.79,YOU WERE A GREAT STRATEGIST.
1705,01:10:47.25,01:10:47.25,"'CAUSE MAKING AN ALLIANCE IS SMART,"
1706,01:10:49.17,01:10:49.17,"BUT THEN BREAKING ALL OF THEM,"
1707,01:10:51.00,01:10:51.00,AND THEN HAVING TO ASK AND EXPECT VOTES FROM THE JURY?
1708,01:10:53.54,01:10:53.54,">> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT,"
1709,01:10:55.21,01:10:55.21,AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO START OFF
1710,01:10:56.75,01:10:56.75,BY SAYING THAT I AM REMORSEFUL.
1711,01:10:58.75,01:10:58.75,"I DID HAVE TO BACKSTAB NINE PEOPLE,"
1712,01:11:01.25,01:11:01.25,BUT I HOPE PEOPLE CAN SEE
1713,01:11:04.75,01:11:04.75,"THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME WAS PART OF STRATEGY,"
1714,01:11:08.08,01:11:08.08,"AND MY FRIENDSHIP IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"
1715,01:11:11.21,01:11:11.21,AND I APOLOGIZE.
1716,01:11:12.62,01:11:12.62,">> THANKS, SASH."
1717,01:11:14.88,01:11:14.88,"CHASE, MY SNUGGLE BUDDY."
1718,01:11:18.12,01:11:18.12,I FELT LIKE I HAD MORE
1719,01:11:21.75,01:11:21.75,"OF AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO YOU SINCE,"
1720,01:11:24.92,01:11:24.92,"YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD ALWAYS TELL ME"
1721,01:11:26.42,01:11:26.42,"THAT YOU TRUSTED ME THE MOST,"
1722,01:11:27.96,01:11:27.96,AND THAT YOU COULD NEVER VOTE FOR ME.
1723,01:11:29.62,01:11:29.62,AND IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING
1724,01:11:32.92,01:11:32.92,HOW EASY IT WAS FOR YOU
1725,01:11:35.12,01:11:35.12,THE DAY THAT I GOT VOTED OUT TO JUST KIND OF ACCEPT IT.
1726,01:11:37.54,01:11:37.54,>> I DID PUT MY NECK ON THE LINE FOR YOU.
1727,01:11:39.17,01:11:39.17,"AS SOON AS, YOU KNOW,"
1728,01:11:40.67,01:11:40.67,"THE OTHER ALLIANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT VOTING YOU OUT,"
1729,01:11:42.75,01:11:42.75,WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING I DID?
1730,01:11:44.25,01:11:44.25,"I CAME TO YOU AND I SAID,"
1731,01:11:45.96,01:11:45.96,"""LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT HOLLY IS TRYING TO DO"
1732,01:11:48.12,01:11:48.12,"WITH THIS ALLIANCE."""
1733,01:11:49.29,01:11:49.29,"I, OBVIOUSLY, DON'T WANT TO DO THAT."
1734,01:11:50.83,01:11:50.83,"I TRUST YOU THE MOST, WHICH I DID,"
1735,01:11:52.21,01:11:52.21,SO I THOUGHT THE BEST THING TO DO WAS GO OUT
1736,01:11:54.46,01:11:54.46,AND GET A SIXTH PERSON.
1737,01:11:55.71,01:11:55.71,WHAT HAPPENED IS FABIO AND NAONKA BACKED OUT.
1738,01:11:58.12,01:11:58.12,THAT GAVE ME ABSOLUTELY NO OPTION.
1739,01:12:00.71,01:12:00.71,">> WELL, WHY WERE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD, SASH?"
1740,01:12:05.83,01:12:05.83,>> I JUST THINK CHASE COULD HAVE STEPPED UP MORE.
1741,01:12:07.92,01:12:07.92,>> WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE...
1742,01:12:09.17,01:12:09.17,">> YOU, TOO, SASH. DON'T EVEN START."
1743,01:12:11.04,01:12:11.04,"YOU COULD HAVE STEPPED UP, TOO."
1744,01:12:12.25,01:12:12.25,YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE IDOL.
1745,01:12:13.71,01:12:13.71,I COULD HAVE KEPT ON GOING
1746,01:12:14.96,01:12:14.96,IF YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO ME.
1747,01:12:17.17,01:12:17.17,I THINK I'M GOOD.
1748,01:12:18.17,01:12:18.17,">> Jeff: THANKS, BRENDA."

1752,01:12:26.29,01:12:26.29,THERE'S REAL GOOD REASONS
1753,01:12:28.29,01:12:28.29,"WHY YOU GUYS ARE THERE AND WE'RE HERE,"
1754,01:12:30.58,01:12:30.58,SO HATS OFF TO YOU GUYS.
1755,01:12:31.96,01:12:31.96,IT'S GOT TO BE AN INCREDIBLE FEELING
1756,01:12:33.25,01:12:33.25,FOR YOU GUYS.
1757,01:12:34.25,01:12:34.25,>> APPRECIATE IT.
1758,01:12:35.33,01:12:35.33,">> CHASE, PLAY THIS OUT WITH ME, OKAY."
1759,01:12:36.92,01:12:36.92,>> OKAY.
1760,01:12:38.25,01:12:38.25,">> ""SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA,"""
1761,01:12:39.67,01:12:39.67,"THERE'S GOING TO BE DUMBER THAN A BAG OF HAMMERS AWARD, OKAY."
1762,01:12:42.21,01:12:42.21,>> OKAY.
1763,01:12:43.92,01:12:43.92,>> YOU HAVE TO PICK SOMEBODY.
1764,01:12:45.25,01:12:45.25,OKAY.
1765,01:12:46.33,01:12:46.33,IT CAN BE ONE OF YOU THREE
1766,01:12:48.88,01:12:48.88,OR IT CAN BE SOMEBODY ON THE JURY.
1767,01:12:50.83,01:12:50.83,"THE ONLY CAVEAT, OBVIOUSLY,"
1768,01:12:52.88,01:12:52.88,"I'M NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE AWARD, OKAY."
1769,01:12:55.12,01:12:55.12,SO YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR ME.
1770,01:12:56.79,01:12:56.79,WHO DO YOU PICK FOR THE DUMBER THAN A BAG OF HAMMERS THIS YEAR?
1771,01:12:59.67,01:12:59.67,">> WELL, OBVIOUSLY,"

1773,01:13:03.29,01:13:03.29,BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING UP HERE AND Y'ALL ARE OVER THERE.
1774,01:13:05.71,01:13:05.71,">> CLEARLY, THAT'S HOW I STARTED OUT TALKING TO YOU GUYS."

1776,01:13:09.33,01:13:09.33,BECAUSE I CAN'T PICK YOU.
1777,01:13:10.79,01:13:10.79,">> SORRY, MAN, I MADE THE RULES."
1778,01:13:12.12,01:13:12.12,"GO AHEAD, MAKE YOUR CHOICE AGAIN."

1804,01:13:59.04,01:13:59.04,THAT YOU MADE ON YOUR OWN IN THIS GAME?
1805,01:14:02.12,01:14:02.12,>> IT WAS IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE GAME.
1806,01:14:04.12,01:14:04.12,I HAD A CHANCE TO GO WITH PEOPLE
1807,01:14:06.12,01:14:06.12,THAT I DIDN'T TRUST
1808,01:14:07.54,01:14:07.54,"AND AN ALLIANCE OF SIX VERSUS FOUR,"
1809,01:14:09.79,01:14:09.79,OR I HAD A CHANCE TO GO WITH FOUR PEOPLE
1810,01:14:11.54,01:14:11.54,THAT I COULD TRUST.
1811,01:14:12.67,01:14:12.67,I TOOK THAT CHANCE IN THE BEGINNING.
1812,01:14:14.58,01:14:14.58,THAT WAS TO VOTE SHANNON OUT.
1813,01:14:15.83,01:14:15.83,THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MOVE FOR ME IN THE GAME
1814,01:14:17.67,01:14:17.67,BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE I COULD TRUST.

2017,01:20:52.08,01:20:52.08,"ALINA, YOU'RE UP."
2018,01:20:57.25,01:20:57.25,">> HI, GUYS."
2019,01:20:58.46,01:20:58.46,"FABIO, YOU'RE LIKE THE ULTIMATE SURFER BOY, LIKE, DUDE."
2020,01:21:02.29,01:21:02.29,"I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU,"
2021,01:21:03.88,01:21:03.88,BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO A BOY.
2022,01:21:06.58,01:21:06.58,I WANT TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO A MAN.
2023,01:21:08.83,01:21:08.83,"SASH, THIS IS YOUR SHOT."
2024,01:21:10.46,01:21:10.46,"LIKE, YOU WORKED FOR YOUR SPOT HERE."
2025,01:21:12.21,01:21:12.21,CONVINCE ME YOU DESERVE IT MORE THAN THE YOUNG GUYS.
2026,01:21:15.12,01:21:15.12,">> RIGHT, WELL, THROUGHOUT THE GAME,"
2027,01:21:18.75,01:21:18.75,"WHEN TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS COMING UP,"
2028,01:21:20.67,01:21:20.67,I FEEL AS THOUGH FABIO WAS EITHER THE LAST TO KNOW
2029,01:21:24.00,01:21:24.00,OR PLAYED ALOOF
2030,01:21:25.96,01:21:25.96,UNTIL SOMEONE TOLD HIM RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL.
2031,01:21:27.33,01:21:27.33,>> I KNEW A LOT MORE
2032,01:21:28.38,01:21:28.38,THAN YOU GUYS GAVE ME CREDIT FOR.
2033,01:21:29.58,01:21:29.58,I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT.
2034,01:21:30.88,01:21:30.88,>> YOU WEREN'T IN ON EVERY VOTES.
2035,01:21:32.29,01:21:32.29,THERE WERE MANY TIMES WE WENT TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
2036,01:21:34.17,01:21:34.17,WHERE FABIO THOUGHT THE VOTE WAS GOING ONE WAY
2037,01:21:35.96,01:21:35.96,WHERE IT REALLY WENT ANOTHER.
2038,01:21:37.38,01:21:37.38,"AND CHASE WAS WISHY-WASHY,"
2039,01:21:39.04,01:21:39.04,"WOULD GO FROM ONE ALLIANCE TO THE OTHER,"
2040,01:21:41.71,01:21:41.71,"LEAK INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH,"
2041,01:21:43.21,01:21:43.21,AND WAITED FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE THE DECISION.
2042,01:21:45.71,01:21:45.71,">> OKAY, OKAY."
2043,01:21:47.33,01:21:47.33,"CHASE, I'M ACTUALLY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY YOU TONIGHT."
2044,01:21:51.42,01:21:51.42,YOU CAME IN HERE STRONG.
2045,01:21:53.00,01:21:53.00,TELL ME I HAVE TO VOTE FOR YOU AND NOT THE OTHER GUYS.
2046,01:21:55.46,01:21:55.46,">> PEOPLE SAY I WAS WISHY-WASHY,"
2047,01:21:57.33,01:21:57.33,PEOPLE SAY I DID ONE THING AND ALL THIS.
2048,01:21:59.33,01:21:59.33,IT WASN'T WISHY-WASHY.
2049,01:22:00.50,01:22:00.50,IT WAS ME MAKING MYSELF A WAY OUT
2050,01:22:02.46,01:22:02.46,WHERE I COULD PLAY WITH PEOPLE I COULD TRUST
2051,01:22:04.62,01:22:04.62,"BUT DIDN'T GET MYSELF IN THE SITUATION WHERE,"
2052,01:22:07.08,01:22:07.08,"IF THE ALLIANCE WAS DONE, I'M DONE."
2053,01:22:08.50,01:22:08.50,"WHEN WE DID VOTE PEOPLE OUT,"
2054,01:22:10.17,01:22:10.17,"IT REALLY DID HURT ME,"
2055,01:22:11.58,01:22:11.58,"GOING BEHIND THE BACKS AND SAY,"
2056,01:22:12.96,01:22:12.96,"""WHY DO YOU THINK I'M SO CLOSE WITH HER?"""
2057,01:22:14.83,01:22:14.83,LIKE SASH DID WITH BRENDA TO VOTE THOSE PEOPLE OUT.
2058,01:22:17.21,01:22:17.21,"AND A GUY LIKE FABIO,"
2059,01:22:18.71,01:22:18.71,HE'S GOT THE STRATEGY NOT TO PISS PEOPLE OFF
2060,01:22:20.88,01:22:20.88,BUT STILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE GAME.
2061,01:22:22.54,01:22:22.54,I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.
2062,01:22:23.67,01:22:23.67,"HALF THE TRIBAL COUNCILS WE CAME BACK FROM,"
2063,01:22:25.46,01:22:25.46,"FABIO WAS LIKE, ""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?"""
2064,01:22:27.25,01:22:27.25,HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS VOTED OUT.
2065,01:22:28.83,01:22:28.83,THAT'S NOT A STRATEGY.
2066,01:22:29.83,01:22:29.83,>> YOU TRIED TO GET THROUGH THE GAME
2067,01:22:31.12,01:22:31.12,"WITHOUT OFFENDING ANYBODY,"
2068,01:22:32.62,01:22:32.62,"WITHOUT DOUBLE-CROSSING ANYBODY,"
2069,01:22:34.12,01:22:34.12,"THIS AND THAT, BUT I ACTUALLY DID IT."
2070,01:22:35.75,01:22:35.75,"YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T HAVE TO BACKSTAB ANYBODY,"
2071,01:22:37.88,01:22:37.88,AND THAT'S HARD TO DO IN THIS GAME.
2072,01:22:39.17,01:22:39.17,">> IT IS HARD TO DO, BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT"
2073,01:22:41.04,01:22:41.04,BY THE STRATEGY HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
2074,01:22:42.50,01:22:42.50,HE DID IT BY NOT KNOWING
2075,01:22:44.04,01:22:44.04,WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON HALF THE TIME.
2076,01:22:46.08,01:22:46.08,"AND I'M SORRY, HE WON THREE IN A ROW"
2077,01:22:47.75,01:22:47.75,"TO GET HERE, AND THAT'S IMPRESSIVE."
2078,01:22:49.00,01:22:49.00,BUT THIS ISN'T THE N.B.A. FINALS.
2079,01:22:50.08,01:22:50.08,THIS ISN'T WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN FOUR
2080,01:22:51.79,01:22:51.79,"AND WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP,"
2081,01:22:52.96,01:22:52.96,"THIS IS OUTWIT, OUTPLAY AND OUTLAST,"
2082,01:22:55.12,01:22:55.12,AND WINNING THREE IN A ROW ISN'T DOING THAT.
2083,01:22:57.33,01:22:57.33,">> THAT'S OUTPLAYING YOU, BRO."
2084,01:22:58.62,01:22:58.62,>> YOU DIDN'T OUTLAST ME.
2085,01:23:00.29,01:23:00.29,YOU OUTPLAYED ME IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES.
2086,01:23:01.75,01:23:01.75,>> I BROUGHT YOU TO THE FINAL THREE.
2087,01:23:03.38,01:23:03.38,>> AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
2088,01:23:04.58,01:23:04.58,>> OUTLAST GETS YOU TO HERE.
2089,01:23:06.46,01:23:06.46,"BUT THE REAL QUESTION SHOULD BE,"
2090,01:23:08.08,01:23:08.08,WHO WAS ABLE TO OUTPLAY
2091,01:23:09.62,01:23:09.62,AND WHO WAS ABLE TO OUTWIT?
2092,01:23:11.17,01:23:11.17,">> WELL, YOU DIDN'T OUTPLAY ANYBODY, SASH."
2093,01:23:12.58,01:23:12.58,>> I LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
2094,01:23:14.17,01:23:14.17,"I LIKE THAT THIS IS, LIKE, TWO,"
2095,01:23:16.67,01:23:16.67,MAYBE THREE MEN REALLY FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY WANT.
2096,01:23:19.12,01:23:19.12,"THANK YOU, GUYS."
2097,01:23:20.12,01:23:20.12,YOU GUYS HELPED A LOT.
