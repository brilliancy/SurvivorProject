416,00:17:10.62,00:17:13.29,AND THE BEST PERSON FOR METO DO THAT WITH IS SASH.
417,00:17:13.29,00:17:15.25,"I HAVE TO HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE,"
418,00:17:15.25,00:17:16.12,"ME AND SASH,"

421,00:17:19.54,00:17:21.46,"BECAUSE HE DOES THAT,AND IT'S ANNOYING."
422,00:17:23.58,00:17:25.12,YOU PERSONALLY?
423,00:17:25.12,00:17:27.92,"BECAUSE THAT COULD BE BADFOR YOU, MAN."

430,00:17:38.29,00:17:40.17,I THINK THEY WOULD TAKEALL THE VOTES.
431,00:17:40.17,00:17:42.12,>> YOU AND I COULD VOTEHOLLY TONIGHT
432,00:17:42.12,00:17:44.08,AND NOT EVEN LET IT COMEDOWN TO CHASE.
433,00:17:44.08,00:17:45.21,>> THAT'S TRUE.
434,00:17:45.21,00:17:47.50,FABIO BROUGHT UPA LOT OF GOOD POINTS.
435,00:17:47.50,00:17:49.17,PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GIVING DAN
436,00:17:49.17,00:17:51.25,"A LITTLE TOO MUCH CREDITFOR BEING A THREAT,"
437,00:17:51.25,00:17:52.88,BUT HOLLY IS A THREAT
438,00:17:52.88,00:17:54.71,BECAUSE SHE'STHE ONLY WOMAN LEFT IN THE GAME
439,00:17:54.71,00:17:56.79,AND THERE ARE QUITEA FEW WOMEN ON THE JURY.
440,00:17:56.79,00:17:58.25,"NOT ONLY THAT,"
441,00:17:58.25,00:18:00.96,HOLLY COULD GET ALL THE VOTES
442,00:18:00.96,00:18:02.92,FROM ALL THE FORMERESPADA MEMBERS.
443,00:18:02.92,00:18:05.12,>> SO I'M NOT TRYINGTO SAVE DAN.
444,00:18:05.12,00:18:06.50,I'M JUST TRYINGTO SPLIT UP CHASE

451,00:18:19.04,00:18:21.42,AND EVERYONE IS TRYING
452,00:18:21.42,00:18:23.42,TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
453,00:18:23.42,00:18:26.83,AND I AM AS WELL.
454,00:18:28.92,00:18:31.08,">> WE'RE THINKING DAN,OF COURSE."

460,00:18:38.25,00:18:39.38,I THOUGHT...
461,00:18:39.38,00:18:41.17,>> YOU HAVEN'T TALKEDTO ME ABOUT IT.
462,00:18:41.17,00:18:42.29,">> YEAH, I KNOW,"
463,00:18:42.29,00:18:44.83,"BUT WE WERE TALKING,AND I THOUGHT MY NAME CAME UP."
464,00:18:44.83,00:18:48.33,SO THAT'S ONLY THINGI WAS THINKING.
465,00:18:48.33,00:18:50.29,I HAVE A FEELING
466,00:18:50.29,00:18:53.71,THAT DAN AND FABIO ARE TELLINGSASH AND CHASE
467,00:18:53.71,00:18:55.29,"THAT I'M A HUGE THREAT,"
468,00:18:55.29,00:18:57.88,THAT THEY NEED TO GET RID OF ME.
469,00:18:57.88,00:18:59.29,AM I CONCERNED AT THIS POINT?
470,00:18:59.29,00:19:00.29,ABSOLUTELY.
471,00:19:00.29,00:19:02.17,BUT I JUST HAVE TO TRUSTIN MY ALLIANCE
472,00:19:02.17,00:19:04.04,AND HOPE THAT TONIGHT
473,00:19:04.04,00:19:05.96,MY NAME ISN'T WRITTEN DOWN.

483,00:19:36.25,00:19:38.17,AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
484,00:19:40.25,00:19:43.54,LET'S TALK ABOUTTODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
485,00:19:43.54,00:19:46.42,"FABIO, HOW BIGWAS TODAY'S WIN FOR YOU?"

488,00:19:49.38,00:19:50.88,IS A HUGE PART OF GETTING
489,00:19:50.88,00:19:52.12,TO THE END OF THIS GAME.
490,00:19:52.12,00:19:54.38,>> Jeff: HOW BIG A FACTORIS TONIGHT'S VOTE

495,00:20:02.83,00:20:04.79,YOU HAVE TO THINKABOUT WHO'S ON THE JURY?
496,00:20:04.79,00:20:06.83,WHO HAS HAD PAST RELATIONSHIPSWITH THEM?
497,00:20:06.83,00:20:08.96,WHO THEY MAYBE RESPECT
498,00:20:08.96,00:20:10.08,FOR CERTAIN REASONS

505,00:20:23.12,00:20:25.33,>> I LIVE A NICE LIFE.
506,00:20:25.33,00:20:26.67,I HAVE MONEY.
507,00:20:26.67,00:20:28.17,AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
508,00:20:28.17,00:20:30.46,"IS GOING TO AWARD MEA MILLION DOLLARS, EVER."
509,00:20:30.46,00:20:32.00,>> Jeff: DOES THAT SEEM FAIRTO YOU?
510,00:20:32.00,00:20:34.08,>> I'M NOT SAYING I COULDN'T USETHE MILLION DOLLARS.

512,00:20:35.88,00:20:38.17,BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE
513,00:20:38.17,00:20:39.92,THAT THEY WOULD SOONERGIVE IT TO.
514,00:20:39.92,00:20:41.88,"I ALWAYS SAID, ""TAKE ME THERE."

518,00:20:47.83,00:20:49.29,IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENT.
519,00:20:49.29,00:20:50.92,>> IT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT
520,00:20:50.92,00:20:53.38,BECAUSE IT INCREASES YOUR ODDS
521,00:20:53.38,00:20:55.38,FROM 33% TO 50%
522,00:20:55.38,00:20:56.92,OR EVEN 100%.

526,00:21:03.08,00:21:05.67,I KNOW THAT DANHAS TALKED TO SASH

528,00:21:07.50,00:21:08.62,AND GETTING RID OF ME.
529,00:21:08.62,00:21:10.21,>> Jeff: WHY WOULD THATMAKE SENSE?
530,00:21:10.21,00:21:11.96,>> BECAUSE DAN SAIDHE WOULD LIKE
531,00:21:11.96,00:21:13.71,FOUR GUYS TO GOTO THE FINAL FOUR.
532,00:21:13.71,00:21:16.21,>> I DON'T THINK I EVER SAID
533,00:21:16.21,00:21:17.21,I WANT FOUR GUYS TO GO.
534,00:21:17.21,00:21:18.92,THE REASON WHY HOLLYWOULD BE VOTED OUT
535,00:21:18.92,00:21:20.08,IS BECAUSE SHE'S A THREAT.
536,00:21:20.08,00:21:21.92,I DON'T KNOWWHERE THIS COMES FROM.
537,00:21:21.92,00:21:23.29,>> HOW AM I A THREAT?
538,00:21:23.29,00:21:25.29,EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU THINKI'M A THREAT.

542,00:21:30.38,00:21:32.12,THAT'S A THREAT.
543,00:21:32.12,00:21:33.71,>> WHY IS THAT A THREAT
544,00:21:33.71,00:21:35.04,WHERE I'M FROM
545,00:21:35.04,00:21:36.88,AND HOW MANY PEOPLE I HAVEIN MY TOWN?

551,00:21:43.17,00:21:44.83,YOU'RE GOING TO SAYIT'S NOT A THREAT.
552,00:21:44.83,00:21:47.08,"WHAT MATTERS IS NOT WHETHERDAN IS RIGHT OR WRONG,"
553,00:21:47.08,00:21:49.12,IT'S THAT'S HIS PERCEPTION.
554,00:21:49.12,00:21:51.46,>> CORRECT.
555,00:21:51.46,00:21:52.88,">> Jeff: CHASE, AT THIS POINT,"
556,00:21:52.88,00:21:55.67,"IT REALLY DOES COME DOWNTO PERCEPTION, DOESN'T IT?"
557,00:21:55.67,00:21:58.25,>> IT'S A CONSTANT MIND GAME.
558,00:21:58.25,00:22:01.00,THEY OVER THERE KNOWMY MIND'S ALWAYS TURNING.

562,00:22:08.29,00:22:11.12,SO IT'S ALWAYSA MIND GAME GOING ON.
563,00:22:11.12,00:22:12.21,">> Jeff: SO, HOLLY,"
564,00:22:12.21,00:22:14.00,WHAT DO YOU SAYTO GET THAT TARGET
565,00:22:14.00,00:22:15.58,OFF YOUR BACK AND BACK ON HIS?
566,00:22:15.58,00:22:17.54,>> HAS HE BEEN AGGRESSIVE?
567,00:22:17.54,00:22:19.46,HAS HE GONE OUTAND TALKED TO PEOPLE?
568,00:22:19.46,00:22:21.67,HAS HE MADE THE RIGHT ALLIANCES?
569,00:22:21.67,00:22:24.21,BUT I ALSO THINKIT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
570,00:22:24.21,00:22:27.38,TO REMEMBER THE NUMBERSIN THE JURY.
571,00:22:27.38,00:22:30.75,"BY ASSESSING WHO IS GOING TO GETTHE LEAST AMOUNT OF VOTES,"
572,00:22:30.75,00:22:32.58,OF COURSE THAT'S THE PERSONYOU WANT TO TAKE.
573,00:22:32.58,00:22:35.12,SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THOSEASPECTS INTO CONSIDERATION
574,00:22:35.12,00:22:37.42,WHEN YOU'RE THIS CLOSETO THE END.
575,00:22:37.42,00:22:39.96,">> Jeff: HOLLY,THOSE ATTRIBUTES YOU MENTIONED,"

578,00:22:44.00,00:22:46.21,THOSE ALL SEEM TO MAKETHE ARGUMENT
579,00:22:46.21,00:22:47.75,TO TAKE HIM TO THE END.
580,00:22:47.75,00:22:49.33,"HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHINGTO EARN THE MONEY,"
581,00:22:49.33,00:22:51.08,WHICH IS DAN'S POINT EXACTLY.
582,00:22:51.08,00:22:53.96,"FABIO, IF YOU JUST ISOLATE IT"
583,00:22:53.96,00:22:55.67,"DOWN TO HOLLY AND DAN TONIGHT,"
584,00:22:55.67,00:22:58.42,IT'S POTENTIALLYA MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE

589,00:23:05.29,00:23:06.25,THIS AFTERNOON AT CAMP.
590,00:23:06.25,00:23:08.96,A LOT OF THE REASONSTHAT HOLLY POINTED OUT
591,00:23:08.96,00:23:10.79,ABOUT DAN BEING A THREAT
592,00:23:10.79,00:23:13.08,IS ALSO WHY HOLLYMAY BE A THREAT AS WELL.
593,00:23:13.08,00:23:16.21,I THINK THAT A LOTOF THE WOMEN ON THE JURY
594,00:23:16.21,00:23:18.38,"RESPECT HOLLYAS A MOTHERLY FIGURE,"
595,00:23:18.38,00:23:20.54,AND I THINK THATA LOT OF HER ANSWERS

597,00:23:22.04,00:23:23.75,THAT'S A COMPLIMENT TO HOLLY.

820,00:33:18.92,00:33:20.17,"AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,"
821,00:33:20.17,00:33:22.08,IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
822,00:33:24.33,00:33:26.00,>> JILL.
823,00:33:26.00,00:33:27.25,">> SHE WAS GOODIN THE CHALLENGES,"
824,00:33:27.25,00:33:29.42,BUT I DON'T THINKSHE MADE ENOUGH OF AN IMPACT
825,00:33:29.42,00:33:31.71,ON THE NEW LA FLOR TRIBETO STICK AROUND.
826,00:33:31.71,00:33:34.29,>> I EXPECTED SURVIVING
827,00:33:34.29,00:33:36.29,IN THE ELEMENTSTO BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT.
828,00:33:36.29,00:33:38.12,I FIGURED THATTHAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
829,00:33:38.12,00:33:39.67,I WOULD DO VERY WELL AT.
830,00:33:39.67,00:33:41.62,"WHAT I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE,HOWEVER,"
831,00:33:41.62,00:33:43.29,IS THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF THE GAME
832,00:33:43.29,00:33:44.62,WOULD BE EQUALLY DIFFICULT.
833,00:33:44.62,00:33:46.58,CLEARLY MY SOCIAL GAMEWASN'T UP TO SNUFF.
834,00:33:50.29,00:33:51.79,>> ALINA.
835,00:33:51.79,00:33:53.96,">> PROBABLY ONE OF THE BESTOVERALL COMPETITORS IN THE GAME,"
836,00:33:53.96,00:33:55.21,I THINK.
837,00:33:55.21,00:33:58.04,>> I'D RATHER BE ELIMINATEDBECAUSE I'M A THREAT
838,00:33:58.04,00:33:59.83,THAN TO BE ELIMINATEDBECAUSE I'M DISPENSABLE.
839,00:33:59.83,00:34:01.79,SO THAT MAKES ME PROUDOF MY GAME
840,00:34:01.79,00:34:03.121,THAT I WAS THAT BIG OF A THREATTHAT THEY HAD TO GET RID OF ME.
841,00:34:06.25,00:34:07.25,>> MARTY.
842,00:34:07.25,00:34:08.25,>> MARTY.

849,00:34:16.25,00:34:18.54,>> I WOULD HAVE IMAGINEDTHAT MY STRATEGY
850,00:34:18.54,00:34:20.75,"WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORELYING, CHEATING, AND STEALING,"
851,00:34:20.75,00:34:22.58,"AND AS IT TURNS OUT,I NEVER LIED ONCE."
852,00:34:22.58,00:34:25.29,"I NEVER REALLY MADEANY PROMISES I COULDN'T KEEP,"
853,00:34:25.29,00:34:27.38,SO I LOVED THE WAYI PLAYED THE GAME.
854,00:34:31.04,00:34:32.12,>> BRENDA.
855,00:34:32.12,00:34:35.04,">> GREAT STRATEGIST IN THE GAME,AND ALMOST A MASTERMIND."
856,00:34:35.04,00:34:38.79,SO ONE OF THE BEST OVERALLPLAYERS IN THE GAME.
857,00:34:38.79,00:34:42.71,>> YOU DON'T REALLY KNOWHOW STRONG YOU ARE
858,00:34:42.71,00:34:44.38,UNTIL YOU'RE TESTED WITH THINGS
859,00:34:44.38,00:34:46.50,"LIKE NOT EATING, NOT SLEEPING,"
860,00:34:46.50,00:34:48.25,"DEALING WITHALL THESE PERSONALITIES,"
861,00:34:48.25,00:34:50.88,AND I WAS REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF
862,00:34:50.88,00:34:52.33,"BECAUSE I STAYED FOCUSED,"
863,00:34:52.33,00:34:54.58,AND I'VE COME OUT OF THISA NEW PERSON.
864,00:34:59.17,00:35:01.08,>> NAONKA.
865,00:35:01.08,00:35:02.54,">> 11 DAYS LEFT,"
866,00:35:02.54,00:35:04.50,AND TO WALK OUT OF THE GAME...
867,00:35:04.50,00:35:06.38,>> SHE HAD AN IDOL IN HER HANDWHEN SHE QUIT.
868,00:35:06.38,00:35:07.79,>> DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTING.

870,00:35:09.79,00:35:11.33,"AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY THAT,"
871,00:35:11.33,00:35:12.96,BUT I ALWAYS HAD A SMILE.
872,00:35:12.96,00:35:14.29,I WAS FRIENDLY.
873,00:35:14.29,00:35:16.92,AND I HADA VERY STRATEGICAL GAME.
874,00:35:16.92,00:35:19.21,"I'M NOT TRYING TO TOOTMY OWN HORN,"
875,00:35:19.21,00:35:22.46,"BUT I WAS LITERALLYTHE SMARTEST PLAYER IN THE GAME,"
876,00:35:22.46,00:35:24.08,"HANDS DOWN,"
877,00:35:24.08,00:35:25.100,AND THE CRAZIEST.
878,00:35:29.58,00:35:31.54,>> ANOTHER QUITTER.
879,00:35:31.54,00:35:33.42,PURPLE KELLY.
880,00:35:33.42,00:35:34.75,>> PURPLE KELLY.
881,00:35:34.75,00:35:36.17,>> PROBABLY WOULDHAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HER
882,00:35:36.17,00:35:37.75,TO BE VOTED OUT THAN TO QUIT.
883,00:35:37.75,00:35:40.25,">> MY REPUTATION IS NOTA QUITTER,"
884,00:35:40.25,00:35:42.58,"AND PEOPLE BACK HOME,THEY ALL KNOW THAT."
885,00:35:42.58,00:35:44.29,SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME
886,00:35:44.29,00:35:46.12,"TO BE SEEN WALKING AWAYFROM SOMETHING,"
887,00:35:46.12,00:35:47.71,BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.
888,00:35:47.71,00:35:48.104,SO THAT'S THE WORST PART.
889,00:35:53.12,00:35:54.21,>> BENRY.
890,00:35:54.21,00:35:55.08,HUGE PHYSICAL THREAT.

896,00:36:05.08,00:36:07.71,"THE NEXT THREE, FOUR,HOWEVER MANY CHALLENGES."

905,00:36:27.21,00:36:29.21,AND I PROVED TO MYSELF I COULD.
