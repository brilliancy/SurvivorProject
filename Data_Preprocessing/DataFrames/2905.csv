510,00:34:21.57,00:34:21.57,>> ALL RIGHT. >> JUST IN CASE DALE HAS THIS

516,00:34:49.77,00:34:49.77,HONESTLY? >> I REALLY DO THINK IT'S REAL.
517,00:34:52.93,00:34:52.93,JACLYN AND I ONCE AGAIN FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE.
518,00:34:55.20,00:34:55.20,"THERE ARE OPTIONS HERE. ONE, WE COULD VOTE FOR DALE."
519,00:34:57.83,00:34:57.83,WE COULD TAKE OUT KEITH. OR WE COULD VOTE FOR MISSY.
520,00:35:07.33,00:35:07.33,I FEEL LIKE THE BEST OPTION HERE IS TO ACTUALLY ALIGN WITH DALE
521,00:35:11.70,00:35:11.70,AND USE THAT IDOL FOR THE ALLIANCE'S ADVANTAGE.
522,00:35:21.53,00:35:21.53,BUT THE BIGGEST THING THAT I NEED TO DO FOR THIS VOTE IS LINE
523,00:35:25.40,00:35:25.40,"MYSELF UP SO WHEN THE MERGE HAPPENS, JACLYN AND I ARE A"
524,00:35:30.30,00:35:30.30,"POWER COUPLE. >> Jeff: DALE, TODAY AFTER THE"

528,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,IT HITS YOU LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.
529,00:36:12.20,00:36:12.20,"SINCE KELLEY LEFT, I MIGHT HAVE HAD MAYBE THREE HOURS' SLEEP."
530,00:36:17.37,00:36:17.37,THE PHYSICAL PART OF THE GAME IS FUN.
531,00:36:19.10,00:36:19.10,IT'S THE EXTRA 23 HOURS OF THE DAY THAT'S DRAINING.
532,00:36:22.53,00:36:22.53,">> Jeff: JON, DO YOU FEEL THAT SAME WAY?"
533,00:36:24.37,00:36:24.37,">> I ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY AGREE."

544,00:37:03.10,00:37:03.10,"HAPPENING WITH YOU? >> WHEN SHE CRIES, I CRY."
545,00:37:05.93,00:37:05.93,"WHEN MY DAD CRIES, I CRY. IT'S JUST LIKE A FAMILY CRYING."
546,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,>> Jeff: SHE WASN'T EVEN CRYING.
547,00:37:10.97,00:37:10.97,">> BUT SHE WAS ABOUT. TO WHEN SHE STARTS, I JUST BAWL."
548,00:37:14.43,00:37:14.43,IT'S NOT FAIR. >> Jeff: WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
549,00:37:17.73,00:37:17.73,BECAUSE THIS IS SO UNUSUAL TO HAVE LOVED ONES OUT HERE.
550,00:37:20.63,00:37:20.63,AND IT CLEARLY CHANGES THE GAME COMPLETELY.
551,00:37:23.93,00:37:23.93,>> YEAH. I THINK IT'S JUST KNOWING THAT
552,00:37:26.47,00:37:26.47,YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT.
553,00:37:31.00,00:37:31.00,">> Jeff: SO, DALE, HOW IS TONIGHT'S VOTE DIFFERENT FOR YOU"
554,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,SINCE KELLEY IS GONE? >> MY GAME WENT FROM HAVING A
555,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,LONG-TERM STRATEGY. NOW IT'S ABOUT A 12-HOUR
556,00:37:41.00,00:37:41.00,"STRATEGY. >> Jeff: JON, DID YOU FEEL"
557,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,"THAT TODAY? DID YOU FEEL DALE WAS SAYING,"
558,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,I'M LIVE. USE ME IF YOU WANT.
559,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,">> YEAH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, DALE AND I TALKED."
560,00:37:50.47,00:37:50.47,"THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HE SAID WAS, YOU KNOW, I'M READY TO DO"
561,00:37:55.37,00:37:55.37,"WHAT IT TAKES TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS GAME FOR MY PLAY, SO I"
562,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,"DEFINITELY FELT THAT. >> Jeff: JACLYN, IF INDEED YOU"
563,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,TWO ARE IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN AND HAVING SOMEBODY COME TO YOU AND
564,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,"SAY, LOOK, USE ME, I'M A FREE VOTE, IT HAS TO BE VERY"
565,00:38:08.20,00:38:08.20,"TANTALIZING. >> YEAH, I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF"
566,00:38:10.47,00:38:10.47,NICE TO GET A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT ON THINGS.
567,00:38:13.87,00:38:13.87,">> Jeff: MISSY, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU."
568,00:38:15.97,00:38:15.97,">> NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME OR BAYLOR ACTUALLY."
569,00:38:19.13,00:38:19.13,IT'S A LITTLE DISCONCERTING ALTOGETHER.
570,00:38:22.03,00:38:22.03,">> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, JEFF, FROM MY STANDPOINT, I HAVE TO"
571,00:38:25.93,00:38:25.93,PUT MY ENTIRE FAITH IN THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE THAT JUST VOTED MY
572,00:38:28.77,00:38:28.77,DAUGHTER OUT. THAT'S MY ONLY CHOICE IN THE
573,00:38:30.30,00:38:30.30,GAME NOW. BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY
574,00:38:32.30,00:38:32.30,THING I HAVE TO OFFER IS I'M LOYAL.
575,00:38:34.07,00:38:34.07,"I'M ALL BY MYSELF, A LONE VOTE, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY TIES TO"
576,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,"ANYBODY IN THE GAME. >> Jeff: BAYLOR, A LONE VOTE"
577,00:38:42.23,00:38:42.23,CAN BE VERY VALUABLE. >> I FEEL LIKE JON AND JACLYN
578,00:38:46.20,00:38:46.20,"ARE VERY LOYAL PEOPLE, BUT I'M MORE LOYAL THAN DALE, AND THAT'S"
579,00:38:51.13,00:38:51.13,"THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY. >> Jeff: DALE, YOUR JAYS ARE"
580,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,GIGANTIC. >> IT'S VERY SIMILAR PRIME
581,00:38:57.97,00:38:57.97,MINISTER -- SIMPLE. I LIKE BAYLOR BUT SHE NEEDS TO
582,00:39:02.70,00:39:02.70,"GO UP TO HER GAME. >> Jeff: SO DALE IS SAYING, GO"
583,00:39:05.50,00:39:05.50,BACK THE DAY ONE AND REMEMBER WHO HAS BEEN THERE.
584,00:39:08.87,00:39:08.87,>> IT'S VERY HARD. ONE PERSON NEVER DID ANYTHING
585,00:39:11.20,00:39:11.20,WRONG TO ME AND ANOTHER PERSON DID FLIP ON ME.
586,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,IT'S OUTWEIGHING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
587,00:39:15.63,00:39:15.63,">> Jeff: JON, THAT'S GOT TO INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION, HEARING"
588,00:39:18.07,00:39:18.07,ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF THAT HAPPENED EARLY ON.
589,00:39:19.90,00:39:19.90,>> IT DEFINITELY INFLUENCES MY DECISION.
590,00:39:22.60,00:39:22.60,WE'RE COMING TO THE MERGE. I NEED TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO
591,00:39:25.13,00:39:25.13,"BE WITH ME, WHO CAN I TRUST LONG TERM?"
592,00:39:27.83,00:39:27.83,AND THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT'S VOTE IS ALL ABOUT.
593,00:39:33.37,00:39:33.37,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT. IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
594,00:39:35.27,00:39:35.27,"KEITH, YOU'RE UP. I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES."
595,00:40:17.23,00:40:17.23,THE ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE
596,00:40:20.03,00:40:20.03,"PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
597,00:40:28.87,00:40:28.87,"OKAY. ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE"
598,00:40:30.73,00:40:30.73,DECISION IS FINAL. PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
599,00:40:32.67,00:40:32.67,THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
600,00:40:35.07,00:40:35.07,I'LL READ THE VOTES. FIRST VOTE DALE.
601,00:40:43.80,00:40:43.80,KEITH. MISSY.
602,00:40:46.50,00:40:46.50,"THAT'S ONE VOTE DALE, WOULD BE VOTE MISSY, ONE VOTE KEITH."
603,00:40:52.37,00:40:52.37,KEITH. THAT'S TWO VOTES KEITH.
604,00:40:56.77,00:40:56.77,"DALE. WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES DALE, TWO"
605,00:40:59.53,00:40:59.53,"VOTES KEITH, ONE VOTE MISSY. ONE VOTE LEFT."
606,00:41:05.87,00:41:05.87,"SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF BLOOD VERSUS WATER, DALE."
607,00:41:10.30,00:41:10.30,"YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH. DALE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
608,00:41:40.73,00:41:40.73,"WELL, YOU SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST VOTE THUS FAR, AND IT"
609,00:41:45.27,00:41:45.27,WAS CENTERED AROUND LOYALTY. THE QUESTION THAT TIME WILL
610,00:41:47.20,00:41:47.20,ANSWER IS: DID YOU MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION?
611,00:41:50.23,00:41:50.23,GRAB YOUR TORCHES. HEAD BACK THE CAMP.
612,00:41:52.30,00:41:52.30,GOOD NIGHT. STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
613,00:42:07.63,00:42:07.63,NEXT EPISODE. >> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
614,00:42:14.40,00:42:14.40,"""SURVIVOR""... BLOOD AND WATER FINALLY MERGE."
615,00:42:20.03,00:42:20.03,>> EVERYBODY KNOWS NOW IT'S GAME ON.
616,00:42:22.80,00:42:22.80,>> Jeff: AND NOBODY IS SAFE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING
617,00:42:25.67,00:42:25.67,ME. NOW I HAVE TO VOTE YOU OUT.
618,00:42:27.30,00:42:27.30,>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING AFTER EVERY ONE OF US.
619,00:42:29.57,00:42:29.57,">> IF WE TAKE HIM OUT, IT'S OVER."
620,00:42:31.70,00:42:31.70,>>LY GO OUT SWINGING AND FIGHTING.
621,00:42:37.70,00:42:37.70,>> I DID EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN STARTING AS SOON AS I WOKE
622,00:42:41.17,00:42:41.17,"UP THIS MORNING, AND I THOUGHT I HAD MY BASES COVERED."
623,00:42:45.60,00:42:45.60,JOHN AND JACLYN DID THE SAME TO ME AS THEY DID TO KELLEY.
624,00:42:48.77,00:42:48.77,"I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD, BUT IT WAS AN UPHILL BATTLE TODAY."
625,00:42:51.73,00:42:51.73,THIS GAME WAS EVERYTHING AND MORE THAN I EVER EXPECTED IT
626,00:42:53.90,00:42:53.90,WOULD BE. I CAN'T WAIT TO TALK TO KELLEY.
627,00:42:55.90,00:42:55.90,LISTENING -- A LONG TALK TONIGHT.
