2,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,"  JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans,   marooned for 39 days"
3,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:07.13,00:00:07.13,  Separated into two tribes--     Tagi and Pagong--
5,00:00:10.73,00:00:10.73,"  they competed against each  other to remain on the island,"
6,00:00:14.03,00:00:14.03,  but now the tribes   have merged into one.
7,00:00:15.90,00:00:15.90," Rattana is the name,"
8,00:00:17.80,00:00:17.80,  and it is everyone  for themselves.
9,00:00:20.57,00:00:20.57,"  Every third night,"
10,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,  the entire tribe will hike   deep into the jungle
11,00:00:24.10,00:00:24.10," to take part  in the Tribal Council,"
12,00:00:26.10,00:00:26.10, where they must vote     one of their own
13,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03, off the island.
14,00:00:29.30,00:00:29.30,"  In the end, one will remain"
15,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
16,00:00:39.13,00:00:39.13, Last week on Survivor:
17,00:00:42.30,00:00:42.30, The stakes were raised     for the castaways
18,00:00:44.40,00:00:44.40,  as the two tribes     merged into one.
19,00:00:46.60,00:00:46.60, GREG:   There was a lot of baggage   that we left
20,00:00:50.10,00:00:50.10, on that Pagong beach.
21,00:00:51.77,00:00:51.77, JEFF:  The members of Pagong    were upbeat
22,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,  as they paddled to their     new home at Tagi beach.
23,00:00:55.87,00:00:55.87,I'm excited to go to their camp   and meet new people.
24,00:00:58.63,00:00:58.63,"  Rich came out and was, like,   ""Hey, how are you?"""
25,00:01:01.47,00:01:01.47," You know, he swam out,  which was really nice."
26,00:01:04.00,00:01:04.00,They welcomed us with open arms.
27,00:01:05.30,00:01:05.30, JEFF:  But the Tagi alliance
28,00:01:06.60,00:01:06.60,was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
29,00:01:07.90,00:01:07.90,I don't need to deal with that. After Gretch?
30,00:01:10.30,00:01:10.30,Jenna.
31,00:01:10.30,00:01:10.30,Jenna.
32,00:01:11.63,00:01:11.63,I was thinking Sean.
33,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57, JEFF:    Rudy wasn't happy    with the new Rattana Tribe.
34,00:01:15.87,00:01:15.87," RUDY:    All of a sudden,    we doubled our population."
35,00:01:19.37,00:01:19.37,"  Personally, it's a pain in the ass."
36,00:01:20.57,00:01:20.57, JEFF:   Greg won the first
37,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,"  immunity talisman,"
38,00:01:23.60,00:01:23.60,ensuring that only he could not be voted off at Tribal Council.
39,00:01:26.60,00:01:26.60,  Sean began   his alphabet voting strategy
40,00:01:29.63,00:01:29.63," and to the surprise of many, it was Gretchen who was ousted."
41,00:01:32.60,00:01:32.60,"Oh, my God."
42,00:01:34.07,00:01:34.07,It's me.
43,00:01:36.03,00:01:36.03, JEFF:  Nine members of Rattana     are left.
44,00:01:38.00,00:01:38.00,"  Tonight, one more will go."
45,00:02:51.33,00:02:51.33," SEAN:  Today is, like, Day 22."
46,00:02:54.10,00:02:54.10,"   We had a vote last night,   which is always pretty beat."
47,00:02:56.50,00:02:56.50, Always puts us in a pretty somber mood.
48,00:02:58.63,00:02:58.63,   But last night was   a very strange vote.
49,00:03:00.80,00:03:00.80,"  Last night, it looks   like there was a conspiracy,"
50,00:03:04.07,00:03:04.07,"  and maybe I'm being paranoid and I didn't want to believe it,"
51,00:03:08.47,00:03:08.47,"   but four people from Tagi   voted for Gretchen, I think."
52,00:03:12.33,00:03:12.33," SEAN:  You know, the bloodbath   has begun, you know."
53,00:03:15.30,00:03:15.30," People have started taking it a different way,"
54,00:03:17.83,00:03:17.83, 'cause there's really no good    reason other than strategy
55,00:03:20.90,00:03:20.90, to vote Gretchen off.
56,00:03:25.50,00:03:25.50, GREG:   Gretchen distinctly disliked  this part of the game.
57,00:03:28.57,00:03:28.57,   This was her hardest thing
58,00:03:30.23,00:03:30.23," was voting people off,"
59,00:03:31.77,00:03:31.77,  and the part that she liked the most
60,00:03:33.97,00:03:33.97,was the survival aspect.
61,00:03:35.87,00:03:35.87,GERVASE:   I really don't know     what happened last night.
62,00:03:38.10,00:03:38.10," At first sight, it looks like  they just picked Gretchen off."
63,00:03:40.90,00:03:40.90," SEAN:   I think that  my former team, Tagi,"
64,00:03:43.73,00:03:43.73,  probably formed an alliance   against what they perceived
65,00:03:47.83,00:03:47.83,"   as her... as their   strongest member of Pagong,"
66,00:03:51.03,00:03:51.03,  which was Gretchen.
67,00:03:54.73,00:03:54.73,   It was my idea to get rid    of Gretchen because I...
68,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,  I thought that she was going  to be the next leader.
69,00:04:00.83,00:04:00.83,  She had to go because she...
70,00:04:03.10,00:04:03.10,"  is bright and, uh, is strong  and she was a threat."
71,00:04:08.17,00:04:08.17," SEAN: The, uh, duplicity of the whole   thing is pretty bad,"
72,00:04:11.80,00:04:11.80,  because I think that people  went out of their way
73,00:04:13.87,00:04:13.87,"  to befriend her, and, uh..."
74,00:04:15.57,00:04:15.57, and those were the people who subsequently voted against her.
75,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30," GREG:    That's the game--    duplicitous, sleaziness--"
76,00:04:21.20,00:04:21.20, if you want to play that way.
77,00:04:23.07,00:04:23.07, KELLY:  This is a game;     don't take it personally.
78,00:04:24.90,00:04:24.90," You know, if people came here    to make, you know,"
79,00:04:27.20,00:04:27.20," bosom buddies and, you know, lifelong friends,"
80,00:04:29.67,00:04:29.67,  they should've gone to summer camp.
81,00:04:31.57,00:04:31.57,"GERVASE:    I think, really,   if it happens again,"
82,00:04:35.60,00:04:35.60,"   then you can say for sure   there's an alliance,"
83,00:04:37.53,00:04:37.53,"but if it does,  I'm more determined than ever"
84,00:04:39.70,00:04:39.70," to bust that plan up and still kill them all and win, you know."
85,00:04:45.53,00:04:45.53,"   As far as Pagong,    we are now four."
86,00:04:47.07,00:04:47.07,   They are now five.
87,00:04:48.63,00:04:48.63,   They do have a voting bloc  on us whether we see it or not
88,00:04:51.60,00:04:51.60,and they can pick us off   one by one.
89,00:04:53.50,00:04:53.50, Who needs men?
90,00:04:55.60,00:04:55.60,  My best strategy     is to bond with the women
91,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,   and try to hold on to the  women's vote as long as I can.
92,00:05:03.57,00:05:03.57,"I'm so excited, guys."
93,00:05:06.53,00:05:06.53,I don't care if you vote me off now
94,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,'cause I made it to my cutoff point.
95,00:05:09.73,00:05:09.73,"The girls... no, there ain't no girls"
96,00:05:11.63,00:05:11.63,"going for a while, you guys."
97,00:05:13.40,00:05:13.40,"Thanks, Sue. That makes me feel better."
98,00:05:16.57,00:05:16.57, SUSAN:  The women seem     to be getting along well
99,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,  because the women     are all workers.
100,00:05:19.87,00:05:19.87," Actually, I like Jenna better  than I thought I would."
101,00:05:22.60,00:05:22.60,"  I thought she would drive me   wild and she doesn't, so..."
102,00:05:25.57,00:05:25.57,Don't worry.
103,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,The guys' days are numbered.
104,00:05:28.93,00:05:28.93,They are numbered.
105,00:05:30.43,00:05:30.43,"Us girls... us girls are here for a while, trust me."
106,00:05:33.73,00:05:33.73,"Oh, man, I love it."
107,00:05:34.73,00:05:34.73,We'll be up at the end.
108,00:05:38.07,00:05:38.07, I do see the women versus men  vote continuing on in Rattana.
109,00:05:40.97,00:05:40.97,"As far as my three votes, top-- they're all men."
110,00:05:46.70,00:05:46.70,"Oh, God, you guys, look at these crabs."
111,00:05:49.80,00:05:49.80,"  I see women go out,    get the crab traps."
112,00:05:52.73,00:05:52.73, The women fix the hut.
113,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,  We're carrying the weight   of the team.
114,00:05:56.07,00:05:56.07," Maybe that's unfair,     but that's how I see it."
115,00:05:58.37,00:05:58.37,"Ooh, look at it."
116,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,  ( women screaming )
117,00:06:02.20,00:06:02.20,"Get him... get him, Sue."
118,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,Beat him with the shoe.
119,00:06:07.60,00:06:07.60,   ( women laughing )
120,00:06:08.87,00:06:08.87,She had me beat the hell out of a crab
121,00:06:10.37,00:06:10.37,with a shoe.
122,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90," SUSAN:   As far as the women   becoming an alliance,"
123,00:06:14.83,00:06:14.83,there's a chance that the girls
124,00:06:16.40,00:06:16.40, might want to have an alliance
125,00:06:17.97,00:06:17.97, after there's a few more guys   knocked off.
126,00:06:19.93,00:06:19.93,"  If they do,    I'll just lead on with them"
127,00:06:21.97,00:06:21.97," like,    ""Yeah, that's a good idea."""
128,00:06:23.93,00:06:23.93, But as far as the women    forming an alliance
129,00:06:26.00,00:06:26.00,"  and making one, no."
130,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00, It ain't gonna happen.
131,00:06:28.20,00:06:28.20,  I already got mine. I like mine.
132,00:06:39.30,00:06:39.30, KELLY:    We're all hungry
133,00:06:42.37,00:06:42.37,"  and we're low on energy,   and there's still no one else"
134,00:06:45.30,00:06:45.30,  providing any food     except for Rich.
135,00:06:48.47,00:06:48.47,And we're having   to ration the rice.
136,00:06:49.70,00:06:49.70,You don't have to put
137,00:06:51.27,00:06:51.27," both bowls on right now, Rudy,"
138,00:06:52.67,00:06:52.67,is what I'm saying.
139,00:06:53.70,00:06:53.70,Don't be stubborn.
140,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87, RUDY:    I ain't stubborn.
141,00:06:55.87,00:06:55.87,I'm going to eat
142,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,if everybody's going to eat.
143,00:06:58.60,00:06:58.60,"Okay, okay."
144,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67, I ain't above eating.
145,00:07:01.20,00:07:01.20,"  Having nine people,    it's, uh..."
146,00:07:03.47,00:07:03.47, everything gets smaller again.
147,00:07:05.27,00:07:05.27,"   The rice pot got smaller,"
148,00:07:07.07,00:07:07.07, the sleeping quarters   got smaller.
149,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,"We got four, five bags..."
150,00:07:10.70,00:07:10.70,"So it's four bags there, so we got eight meals there"
151,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,so that's four days.
152,00:07:14.53,00:07:14.53," Or, no, that's only two days."
153,00:07:17.30,00:07:17.30," So, a can's only going   to last us two days?"
154,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93,We're eating that much.
155,00:07:23.10,00:07:23.10,"We have to ration it, then."
156,00:07:24.73,00:07:24.73,So instead of making three pots tonight
157,00:07:28.63,00:07:28.63,we should make two pots   twice a day.
158,00:07:30.10,00:07:30.10,"RUDY: When we go over there to eat,"
159,00:07:31.37,00:07:31.37,the majority rules.
160,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,"Yeah, two pots."
161,00:07:33.70,00:07:33.70, SUSAN: I wish some of the other people
162,00:07:36.00,00:07:36.00, would start conserving     a little more...
163,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,  people that are being pigs.
164,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00, I'll only eat one bowl  at a sitting.
165,00:07:41.50,00:07:41.50," I'm planning on staying  until the end,"
166,00:07:43.63,00:07:43.63,  so I really want     to have something
167,00:07:45.20,00:07:45.20,  for the last couple of days.
168,00:08:17.20,00:08:17.20, We have our fisherman;    it's Rich.
169,00:08:18.60,00:08:18.60,  That's Rich's job.
170,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77," Oh, wow. Two?"
171,00:08:21.93,00:08:21.93,Four.
172,00:08:23.20,00:08:23.20, Four?
173,00:08:24.43,00:08:24.43, ( laughing ):  What a catch.
174,00:08:25.73,00:08:25.73," A ray, a parrot fish,    a catfish"
175,00:08:28.00,00:08:28.00, and a nice little nurse shark.
176,00:08:29.50,00:08:29.50,Baby's gonna have some protein today.
177,00:08:32.10,00:08:32.10,"GERVASE:   Greg showing up, going out  trying to spear a fish."
178,00:08:36.37,00:08:36.37,  They've got nothing.
179,00:08:37.87,00:08:37.87,  I'm not going to do    any better than they will.
180,00:08:39.87,00:08:39.87,  And I think Rich  is in a great position.
181,00:08:42.20,00:08:42.20,"  We vote Rich off,"
182,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47, we don't eat.
183,00:08:44.47,00:08:44.47,Get the torches going.
184,00:08:45.87,00:08:45.87,Get everything happening.
185,00:08:48.00,00:08:48.00,"This is big time, guys."
186,00:08:49.37,00:08:49.37,"Rich, Rich, Rich, Rich, Rich!"
187,00:08:53.60,00:08:53.60,"RICHARD: Now, which one of you sons of bitches"
188,00:08:55.77,00:08:55.77,wrote my name on a card last night?
189,00:08:57.73,00:08:57.73,( laughing )
190,00:08:59.13,00:08:59.13, The bastard didn't get a fish.
191,00:09:00.43,00:09:00.43,"Yeah, he's out of here."
192,00:09:01.47,00:09:01.47, I'm starving.
193,00:09:02.63,00:09:02.63,RICHARD:   As far as who voted for me
194,00:09:04.23,00:09:04.23, at the Tribal Council   last night...
195,00:09:06.03,00:09:06.03, and I'm not certain who it is.
196,00:09:07.83,00:09:07.83,  I'm thinking   it was probably Greg
197,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,  who felt threatened by me.
198,00:09:12.80,00:09:12.80, But it could have been   any of them.
199,00:09:14.30,00:09:14.30,  I've only been with them   a day or two
200,00:09:16.47,00:09:16.47, and I'd not brought in     any fish.
201,00:09:18.30,00:09:18.30,"  Today, on the other hand    I brought in a huge catch."
202,00:09:21.80,00:09:21.80, Three rays...
203,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,   They just lapped that up.
204,00:09:25.77,00:09:25.77,That one's pretty meaty.
205,00:09:28.27,00:09:28.27,GREG: Let's make them dead
206,00:09:29.27,00:09:29.27,so they can stop suffocating.
207,00:09:30.37,00:09:30.37, ( loud smack )
208,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67,Aah!
209,00:09:32.77,00:09:32.77,"You guys, I mean,"
210,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,there's no other humane way
211,00:09:35.73,00:09:35.73,to do that?
212,00:09:37.13,00:09:37.13, It seems humane to me.
213,00:09:38.33,00:09:38.33,Right through its brain.
214,00:09:39.90,00:09:39.90,  I could eat rice     for 17 more days.
215,00:09:41.70,00:09:41.70,"  I could eat rice     the whole time,"
216,00:09:43.27,00:09:43.27,  but they're loving the fish
217,00:09:44.80,00:09:44.80,"  and it seems to make people    feel great,"
218,00:09:46.30,00:09:46.30,   and I squeeze every ounce of credit out of it that I can.
219,00:09:50.70,00:09:50.70," Susie-Q, look at that, please."
220,00:09:52.43,00:09:52.43,"I know, I said"
221,00:09:53.80,00:09:53.80,they look beautiful.
222,00:09:55.00,00:09:55.00,"Dang, Rich!"
223,00:09:56.00,00:09:56.00,Those rays look really good.
224,00:09:57.47,00:09:57.47,"We're all very proud of you, Richie."
225,00:09:59.47,00:09:59.47,   It's the most fish    we've had.
226,00:10:00.67,00:10:00.67, Good.
227,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,  Watch Susie perk up.
228,00:10:13.03,00:10:13.03, She just gets a little protein   and she's back in the race.
229,00:10:16.10,00:10:16.10, GREG:   Rich is playing a big game.
230,00:10:17.93,00:10:17.93,  I think Rich thinks     he's very clever.
231,00:10:19.63,00:10:19.63, He has a lot of things   going on in his mind
232,00:10:22.20,00:10:22.20," that he, uh..."
233,00:10:23.63,00:10:23.63,  selectively decides   what he will share
234,00:10:27.00,00:10:27.00, and with whom.
235,00:10:31.77,00:10:31.77,Fear... comes from...
236,00:10:32.97,00:10:32.97,That's right.
237,00:10:34.10,00:10:34.10, It's useless.
238,00:10:35.20,00:10:35.20,I think religion
239,00:10:36.50,00:10:36.50,is what destroys our society.
240,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,Whoa!
241,00:10:39.20,00:10:39.20,I think it's the reason people treat
242,00:10:41.53,00:10:41.53,other people as if
243,00:10:43.13,00:10:43.13,they're lower than themselves.
244,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,"Rich, that's ground-shaking."
245,00:10:48.90,00:10:48.90,RICHARD:  I'm not sure     how Greg sees me.
246,00:10:50.63,00:10:50.63,  I'm trying to figure out  whether or not
247,00:10:52.87,00:10:52.87,  he's trying to build    an alliance or pull me in
248,00:10:54.97,00:10:54.97,or make me like him in some way.
249,00:10:57.10,00:10:57.10, GREG:   It's kind of weird.    It's good and bad.
250,00:10:58.67,00:10:58.67,You should give it a go.
251,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,"RICHARD: Thank you, buddy."
252,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90,Don't get that stuff near me
253,00:11:05.10,00:11:05.10,with those funny faces.
254,00:11:06.83,00:11:06.83, JENNA:  I'm seeing Greg   in a more devious way
255,00:11:08.03,00:11:08.03,than I've ever seen him before.
256,00:11:09.40,00:11:09.40," Since we moved,"
257,00:11:10.47,00:11:10.47,"   I saw him change so much,"
258,00:11:13.90,00:11:13.90," and so transparently,  to me anyway,"
259,00:11:17.10,00:11:17.10,   that I've changed my whole attitude towards Greg.
260,00:11:19.83,00:11:19.83, GREG:   This scheme is interesting
261,00:11:22.30,00:11:22.30,"  in that you make friends   with people,"
262,00:11:24.93,00:11:24.93,  you make alliances
263,00:11:26.67,00:11:26.67,and you have to  cut them loose at some point.
264,00:11:28.73,00:11:28.73, JENNA:   Greg is working just about  everybody in the group.
265,00:11:32.03,00:11:32.03,I think he's always had Colleen
266,00:11:34.23,00:11:34.23, wrapped around    his little finger.
267,00:11:35.40,00:11:35.40,  It's not like that.
268,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,"   I mean, honestly, if there was a girl here"
269,00:11:39.27,00:11:39.27," who I got along with   really, really well,"
270,00:11:41.53,00:11:41.53,  it would be the same thing     that way.
271,00:11:43.33,00:11:43.33, I feel
272,00:11:44.43,00:11:44.43,  like I have a friend
273,00:11:45.90,00:11:45.90,  and I have somebody  who's my equal
274,00:11:47.40,00:11:47.40,  that I can actually    have a conversation with.
275,00:11:49.07,00:11:49.07,Yesterday night...
276,00:11:51.43,00:11:51.43, I'm voting for you next time.
277,00:11:53.33,00:11:53.33,Fine. See what happens.
278,00:11:55.67,00:11:55.67,You're voting for me.
279,00:11:57.80,00:11:57.80, GREG:    This is the game.
280,00:11:59.77,00:11:59.77,   You bring this little kitty along.
281,00:12:00.83,00:12:00.83,"  You have your little kitten,"
282,00:12:02.47,00:12:02.47, and you pet your kitten     and you enjoy this kitten
283,00:12:04.57,00:12:04.57, and the kitten sleeps with you    every night
284,00:12:06.43,00:12:06.43," and then, you're hungry, man."
285,00:12:08.13,00:12:08.13, You look right   in the kitten's eye
286,00:12:09.63,00:12:09.63,   and snap its neck.
287,00:12:10.83,00:12:10.83, It's nothing personal.  You're hungry.
288,00:12:12.23,00:12:12.23,The kitten has to give its life   for the next level.
289,00:12:14.43,00:12:14.43, What is it about your pet cat?
290,00:12:16.77,00:12:16.77,My pet kitten?
291,00:12:18.00,00:12:18.00,Your pet kitten.
292,00:12:19.43,00:12:19.43,"It's you, kitty."
293,00:12:20.60,00:12:20.60, KELLY: I see him as being a chameleon.
294,00:12:22.93,00:12:22.93,   Changing his colors to fit   whoever he's around.
295,00:12:26.93,00:12:26.93,RICHARD:    He's certainly interacted  with me
296,00:12:29.70,00:12:29.70,  in an incredibly     interesting way
297,00:12:31.53,00:12:31.53,  that suggests to me    that he's trying something
298,00:12:33.90,00:12:33.90,"  that I'm very, very wary of    and that's great."
299,00:12:37.40,00:12:37.40," JENNA:   Rich finds Greg attractive,"
300,00:12:40.17,00:12:40.17, so Rich throws these    little innuendoes out there
301,00:12:42.73,00:12:42.73,"and Greg will just pick right up on them,"
302,00:12:44.97,00:12:44.97,  sit right real close to Rich  and he's playing him.
303,00:12:50.57,00:12:50.57,"  Orgy, Greg?"
304,00:12:51.57,00:12:51.57,Orgy?
305,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,Yeah.
306,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,Sure.
307,00:12:53.57,00:12:53.57,Have... You have?
308,00:12:54.57,00:12:54.57,"Oh, not right now?"
309,00:12:55.60,00:12:55.60,He thought it was an offer.
310,00:12:57.40,00:12:57.40,   GERVASE: Greg and Rich have joked around  a lot.
311,00:12:59.20,00:12:59.20,  We were talking one night.
312,00:13:00.60,00:13:00.60, Rich was getting real personal
313,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,"  about his business, and Greg was all in it."
314,00:13:04.83,00:13:04.83,You guys have never been    with another guy?
315,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,No.
316,00:13:08.73,00:13:08.73,Greg has.
317,00:13:09.73,00:13:09.73,I mean...
318,00:13:10.73,00:13:10.73,"Rich, seriously?"
319,00:13:12.13,00:13:12.13, Just kid... kid stuff.
320,00:13:13.30,00:13:13.30,That's what freaks me out.
321,00:13:15.10,00:13:15.10,I mean... well... I mean...
322,00:13:16.17,00:13:16.17,"No, I... You..."
323,00:13:18.13,00:13:18.13," GREG:  I think, uh, Rich likes     to flirt with everybody,"
324,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"and instead of directly    shutting him down,"
325,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,  I only played his game back.
326,00:13:25.60,00:13:25.60,He's the shy one on tape.
327,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83, I didn't expect that.
328,00:13:27.97,00:13:27.97, I'll tell you the story later.
329,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,   RICHARD:   He's manipulative.
330,00:13:31.67,00:13:31.67,  He's trying to win me over   in some way.
331,00:13:34.10,00:13:34.10,He's just not going about it in  bright enough a way for me.
332,00:13:37.90,00:13:37.90,"I would like to spend more time  with him and get to know him,"
333,00:13:40.23,00:13:40.23,but... I would also rather have   the million dollars
334,00:13:42.33,00:13:42.33, than to have somebody like him around to worry about.
335,00:14:05.33,00:14:05.33,"Oh, gee."
336,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17, What the hell is that?
337,00:14:10.00,00:14:10.00,"Oh, boy."
338,00:14:12.27,00:14:12.27,"Oh, no way."
339,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17,"""It takes skill    to carve the arc."
340,00:14:15.87,00:14:15.87," ""May your aim be true    and find its mark."
341,00:14:17.67,00:14:17.67,"""Archery is the sport of kings."
342,00:14:19.40,00:14:19.40," A reward from home is  what victory brings."""
343,00:14:22.03,00:14:22.03,"  Oh, my, my."
344,00:14:23.03,00:14:23.03,I'm never going to win anything
345,00:14:25.33,00:14:25.33, ( laughing ):  around here.
346,00:14:27.43,00:14:27.43,Got a little bit of a clue.
347,00:14:27.43,00:14:27.43,Bows and arrows.
348,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57," SEAN:   You know, if it has"
349,00:14:30.70,00:14:30.70,"anything to do with something from home,"
350,00:14:32.60,00:14:32.60,I'd like Jenna to win it.
351,00:14:33.80,00:14:33.80,"Thank you, Sean."
352,00:14:34.87,00:14:34.87,I hope it's my pictures.
353,00:14:35.87,00:14:35.87,They might have our family send
354,00:14:37.30,00:14:37.30,a care package... everybody.
355,00:14:38.60,00:14:38.60,They'll just give you the care package...
356,00:14:40.60,00:14:40.60,KELLY:   The reward is going     to be something from home
357,00:14:43.03,00:14:43.03,"  and, um, Jenna's thinking  it's-it's our pictures"
358,00:14:45.40,00:14:45.40,"that we got to bring, and, like,  she really, really..."
359,00:14:48.40,00:14:48.40,She misses her daughters    terribly.
360,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03,  Aren't you excited?
361,00:14:51.10,00:14:51.10,   I love this stuff.
362,00:14:52.97,00:14:52.97,"  I'm going to go home   and be, like,"
363,00:14:54.63,00:14:54.63," ""Oh, I got to do bows   and arrows."""
364,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07,SUSAN: Wow.
365,00:14:58.40,00:14:58.40,"Okay, Jenna, way over."
366,00:14:58.40,00:14:58.40,   Too high.
367,00:14:59.87,00:14:59.87,Is that how you hold it?
368,00:15:01.93,00:15:01.93,( laughing ): Oh.
369,00:15:03.17,00:15:03.17,"SUSAN:  It's guys against girls, too,"
370,00:15:05.07,00:15:05.07,'cause this is very even
371,00:15:06.17,00:15:06.17,because these bow and arrows...
372,00:15:07.50,00:15:07.50,and these arrows are...
373,00:15:08.57,00:15:08.57,  none of them are straight.
374,00:15:10.23,00:15:10.23,"Go, Kelly."
375,00:15:11.23,00:15:11.23,Keep your finger over it.
376,00:15:12.50,00:15:12.50,"Okay, put the string up."
377,00:15:14.47,00:15:14.47,"Now, pull her."
378,00:15:15.73,00:15:15.73,Even if you want to
379,00:15:17.43,00:15:17.43,  keep it at a angle.
380,00:15:21.37,00:15:21.37,"Nice, Rudy."
381,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,Who's on the boat?
382,00:15:34.07,00:15:34.07,I think it's Jeff.
383,00:15:35.27,00:15:35.27,RICHARD:  Bringing news
384,00:15:36.67,00:15:36.67,"   of the competition, I bet."
385,00:15:38.03,00:15:38.03,"Oh, hi, Jeff."
386,00:15:41.23,00:15:41.23, It better be something   really good.
387,00:15:43.17,00:15:43.17,  I'd rather have food  than anything
388,00:15:44.70,00:15:44.70,from home right now.
389,00:15:45.93,00:15:45.93,I would so much rather have food.
390,00:15:47.73,00:15:47.73,"It probably is  a refrigerator,"
391,00:15:49.47,00:15:49.47,"but what are we going to refrigerate, our rice?"
392,00:15:52.13,00:15:52.13,Maybe it's got food already.
393,00:15:53.53,00:15:53.53,It's ice cream sandwiches.
394,00:15:54.93,00:15:54.93,Okay.
395,00:15:55.93,00:15:55.93,( chuckles )
396,00:15:57.60,00:15:57.60,Move the crate.
397,00:15:58.60,00:15:58.60,Perfect.
398,00:16:04.50,00:16:04.50,Oh... a TV.
399,00:16:06.10,00:16:06.10,"Okay, now, before we begin today's reward challenge,"
400,00:16:08.73,00:16:08.73,I'm going to show you some short clips of video
401,00:16:11.13,00:16:11.13,sent from home.
402,00:16:12.43,00:16:12.43,The winner
403,00:16:13.47,00:16:13.47,of the archery contest gets

406,00:16:18.40,00:16:18.40,"I give you this,  a little something from home."
407,00:16:21.07,00:16:21.07,"Okay, ""a little something from home."""

442,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,  Just remember who loves you.
443,00:17:17.37,00:17:17.37,   Sis-sis...
444,00:17:18.37,00:17:18.37,   and she's thinking of you.

449,00:17:25.70,00:17:25.70,"   I'm doing this off the top    of my head, so..."
450,00:17:28.03,00:17:28.03,   That's my husband holding my dog.
451,00:17:29.70,00:17:29.70, Aw...
452,00:17:30.70,00:17:30.70,That's my dog.

454,00:17:33.00,00:17:33.00,and you are me.
455,00:17:34.57,00:17:34.57,"Together, we make it through eternity."

457,00:17:39.77,00:17:39.77,"You know, here's Stimpy."
458,00:17:41.57,00:17:41.57, He's going to come up and give you a big kiss.
459,00:17:44.80,00:17:44.80, Here he comes.

494,00:18:44.57,00:18:44.57,   All right.
495,00:18:45.60,00:18:45.60,  It was nice.

500,00:18:58.40,00:18:58.40, WOMAN: You think he'll notice?
501,00:19:01.57,00:19:01.57,"  ALL:    We miss you, Sean."
502,00:19:03.23,00:19:03.23,   Come home soon...
503,00:19:04.63,00:19:04.63,   but not too soon.
504,00:19:06.07,00:19:06.07,   Good luck.

511,00:19:21.87,00:19:21.87,  Tell Daddy.  Who's the man?
512,00:19:23.57,00:19:23.57, Daddy!
513,00:19:25.20,00:19:25.20,"Oh, she's so cute."
514,00:19:27.73,00:19:27.73,Do it real loud.
515,00:19:29.23,00:19:29.23,Wha-zup!

522,00:19:44.07,00:19:44.07,Not too bad.
523,00:19:45.17,00:19:45.17,"Oh, she's beautiful."

526,00:19:50.53,00:19:50.53,"You shouldn't have shown me that, man."
527,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,"JEFF: Well, it breaks my heart"
528,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,"to say this, Jenna."
529,00:19:57.07,00:19:57.07,"   Oh, don't tell me."
530,00:19:58.90,00:19:58.90,We never received a tape back.
531,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90, And I'm really sorry.
532,00:20:05.63,00:20:05.63,"Oh, man."
533,00:20:14.43,00:20:14.43,   Are we going to do the archery now?
534,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,"JEFF: Well, there is an upside to this"
535,00:20:17.70,00:20:17.70,that still includes you.
536,00:20:19.20,00:20:19.20,The reward for today's challenge is two parts.
537,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03,   One is a private screening
538,00:20:24.90,00:20:24.90,for the full tape.
539,00:20:26.30,00:20:26.30,  The winner also gets to make their own video postcard
540,00:20:28.53,00:20:28.53,   and send it home.
541,00:20:29.87,00:20:29.87,"And that one, Jenna,"
542,00:20:30.97,00:20:30.97,I can guarantee you will get there
543,00:20:32.67,00:20:32.67,'cause I'll put it in the overnight myself tomorrow.
544,00:20:35.80,00:20:35.80," So, one person's going to get"
545,00:20:37.47,00:20:37.47,   the whole kit and caboodle tonight
546,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,and the others are going   to get nothing else.
547,00:20:48.67,00:20:48.67,"Okay, so you're going"
548,00:20:50.03,00:20:50.03,"to get one arrow, that's it."
549,00:20:51.40,00:20:51.40,"Remember, the one who shoots their arrow"
550,00:20:54.13,00:20:54.13,"closest to the bull's-eye,"
551,00:20:56.13,00:20:56.13,gets to see their entire video
552,00:20:57.67,00:20:57.67,and make one
553,00:20:58.97,00:20:58.97,of their own.
554,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,You guys comfortable?
555,00:21:07.50,00:21:07.50,Nice.
556,00:21:09.53,00:21:09.53,  Greg is on the mark.
557,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87,   I'll let you handle this.
558,00:21:14.23,00:21:14.23,  The split...
559,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,"Yeah, I'm worried about that."
560,00:21:19.63,00:21:19.63,Good try.
561,00:21:20.70,00:21:20.70,Yay. You hit the board.
562,00:21:23.20,00:21:23.20,"  Oh, I wanted   to see my daughters."
563,00:21:24.90,00:21:24.90,"Go, Rudy."
564,00:21:26.03,00:21:26.03,Make it count.
565,00:21:27.90,00:21:27.90,"Well, this ain't my bag."
566,00:21:33.87,00:21:33.87,JEFF: Greg's still looking good right now.
567,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,Close... but no cigar.
568,00:21:43.77,00:21:43.77,"Come on, Sue."
569,00:21:45.07,00:21:45.07,You guys...
570,00:21:46.93,00:21:46.93,JEFF: Tim's waiting to hear.
571,00:21:48.70,00:21:48.70,Waiting to hear from you.
572,00:21:55.33,00:21:55.33,Well... not close.
573,00:21:57.97,00:21:57.97,"Good luck, Kelly."
574,00:22:02.87,00:22:02.87,Good try.
575,00:22:03.93,00:22:03.93,Great try.
576,00:22:05.37,00:22:05.37,Nice try.
577,00:22:08.00,00:22:08.00,Mom and Dad would love
578,00:22:09.77,00:22:09.77,"to hear from you, Colleen."
579,00:22:16.43,00:22:16.43,Good velocity.
580,00:22:18.53,00:22:18.53,"All right, Gervase, no big deal."
581,00:22:20.97,00:22:20.97,"Come on, for your little girl."
582,00:22:22.40,00:22:22.40,The entire...
583,00:22:27.23,00:22:27.23,"Nice try, Gervase. Nice try."
584,00:22:29.30,00:22:29.30,"Okay, Rich."
585,00:22:30.80,00:22:30.80,"Let's go, Richie."
586,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,Dead-Eye Rich.
587,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,Here he goes.
588,00:22:39.10,00:22:39.10,Last shot.
589,00:22:40.30,00:22:40.30,It's up to you.
590,00:22:47.87,00:22:47.87,No.
591,00:22:48.93,00:22:48.93,"Congratulations, man."
592,00:22:50.87,00:22:50.87,Wait a minute.
593,00:22:51.93,00:22:51.93,"Congratulations, Greg."
594,00:22:53.93,00:22:53.93," Thanks, guys."
595,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,JEFF: So Greg is going back up there
596,00:22:56.83,00:22:56.83,and watch his tape.
597,00:22:58.03,00:22:58.03,You can include these guys if you want.
598,00:22:59.53,00:22:59.53,You can do whatever you want with it.
599,00:23:00.60,00:23:00.60,   Of course.
600,00:23:01.63,00:23:01.63,"  If it's going to be funny,"
601,00:23:02.93,00:23:02.93,"  which I figured it would,"
602,00:23:04.43,00:23:04.43,  I thought other people might  get a kick out of it.
603,00:23:06.47,00:23:06.47,   At least she could provide entertainment for other people.
604,00:23:08.97,00:23:08.97," Mukaluka, mau-mau, ping-ping."
605,00:23:11.47,00:23:11.47,  ( clicking tongue )
606,00:23:13.13,00:23:13.13,   How are you doing?
607,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13, I miss you very much.
608,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,   ( kissing sounds )
609,00:23:18.87,00:23:18.87,"That's right, ping-ping."
610,00:23:20.60,00:23:20.60,RICHARD:   I didn't think Greg's tape   was unusual.
611,00:23:23.83,00:23:23.83, I expected that
612,00:23:24.97,00:23:24.97, and was excited by it.
613,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50, You could tell
614,00:23:27.50,00:23:27.50,  she was having fun
615,00:23:29.00,00:23:29.00, and knew he would laugh   at what she was doing
616,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,  and I was laughing.    I loved it.
617,00:23:32.60,00:23:32.60,"Any circumstance  you find yourself in,"
618,00:23:35.20,00:23:35.20,  you're not sure what to do--  you're in a quandary;
619,00:23:37.33,00:23:37.33,  you're in a pickle;
620,00:23:39.10,00:23:39.10,   you're in a bind;
621,00:23:40.30,00:23:40.30,think what Billy Joel would do.
622,00:23:42.17,00:23:42.17,Think about it.
623,00:23:43.23,00:23:43.23,  ( laughing )
624,00:23:44.73,00:23:44.73,"Think, what would Billy Joel do?"
625,00:23:51.37,00:23:51.37,   Anything.
626,00:23:53.43,00:23:53.43,Let's talk about  who's probably
627,00:23:55.00,00:23:55.00, sleeping on the island    right now.
628,00:23:56.43,00:23:56.43," All the giant,"
629,00:23:58.33,00:23:58.33,  scary spiders are sleeping.
630,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80, That's how mom used to put us    to sleep at night.
631,00:24:03.00,00:24:03.00, All the animals are sleeping.
632,00:24:04.57,00:24:04.57,  You make Mom proud.
633,00:24:06.03,00:24:06.03,You make Mom real proud.
634,00:24:17.77,00:24:17.77,  Just remember who loves you.
635,00:24:19.07,00:24:19.07,Sis-sis.
636,00:24:20.40,00:24:20.40,   ( kissing sounds )
637,00:24:22.60,00:24:22.60,   ( silly grunting )
638,00:24:26.43,00:24:26.43, SEAN:  I definitely see Greg  differently now
639,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53, after seeing his video
640,00:24:29.90,00:24:29.90,and attaching a lit bit  of a family with him.
641,00:24:31.20,00:24:31.20,At least we know
642,00:24:32.57,00:24:32.57,  he's not the only screwball  in his family.
643,00:24:34.30,00:24:34.30,   Maybe it's a genetic trait   over there.
644,00:24:35.67,00:24:35.67,"You're on, buddy."
645,00:24:35.67,00:24:35.67,Okay.
646,00:24:37.50,00:24:37.50,"   Hi, Julie."
647,00:24:38.97,00:24:38.97,"  I just want to say,    you know,"
648,00:24:40.57,00:24:40.57, it was really special
649,00:24:42.00,00:24:42.00,for you to send me
650,00:24:43.40,00:24:43.40,and everybody here what you did.
651,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,We feel like we could feel you
652,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,and we felt you.
653,00:24:48.73,00:24:48.73,Some of us felt you
654,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,and others just imagined   what it's like to feel you.
655,00:24:52.97,00:24:52.97, RUDY:    I can't understand a guy talking to his sister that way.
656,00:24:56.17,00:24:56.17,"  It sounded like Greg   was talking, maybe, incest."
657,00:24:59.40,00:24:59.40,That's the way it sounded to me.
658,00:25:01.87,00:25:01.87,  ( laughing )
659,00:25:02.90,00:25:02.90,Why not make allusions?
660,00:25:04.23,00:25:04.23, It crosses all those borders.
661,00:25:06.23,00:25:06.23,"   And, God, what are people going to think?"
662,00:25:08.50,00:25:08.50,"  And then, sexual allusions  for my sister?"
663,00:25:11.10,00:25:11.10,  What's gonna happen?
664,00:25:12.60,00:25:12.60," Julie, we got to put up with  this for about two more weeks"
665,00:25:15.60,00:25:15.60,"and, uh, then we might kill him."
666,00:25:18.30,00:25:18.30,Is that doing you a favor?
667,00:25:20.63,00:25:20.63,  ( laughing )
668,00:25:22.37,00:25:22.37,"Good work, Rudy."
669,00:25:23.93,00:25:23.93,"Good job, Rudy."
670,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,RUDY: Yeah.
671,00:25:34.00,00:25:34.00, JENNA:  I can't imagine
672,00:25:35.57,00:25:35.57,  anybody missing their kids    more than I do every night.
673,00:25:41.97,00:25:41.97,   Miss my beauties.
674,00:25:44.30,00:25:44.30,Miss Sadie and Sabrina.
675,00:25:49.93,00:25:49.93, I can't imagine my mom     not getting the tape out.
676,00:25:53.23,00:25:53.23,It would've done wonders  to see that my kids are okay.
677,00:25:57.97,00:25:57.97, To hear their voices.
678,00:26:01.90,00:26:01.90," To hear, ""I love you, Mommy."""
679,00:26:37.47,00:26:37.47,RICHARD:   Yesterday was cool.
680,00:26:38.93,00:26:38.93, We had that reward challenge  with the bow and arrow
681,00:26:41.67,00:26:41.67," and the reward was, the, uh..."
682,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43," videotapes from home,"
683,00:26:45.17,00:26:45.17,"  and for me,  that was way better than food."
684,00:26:48.33,00:26:48.33,"GERVASE:   Now, seeing those videos of everybody's family, it's, like,"
685,00:26:50.97,00:26:50.97,"  even if you didn't   like somebody before,"
686,00:26:52.93,00:26:52.93," you see that somebody   cares and loves this person,"
687,00:26:55.87,00:26:55.87, so it makes it harder for me     to boot somebody off now.
688,00:27:02.70,00:27:02.70, KELLY:    I felt so bad for Jenna.
689,00:27:04.27,00:27:04.27,  She practiced all morning   on that stupid bow and arrow
690,00:27:06.80,00:27:06.80,"  and then it was just, like,  ""Why bother"" for her."
691,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,  Those are my bruises from the bow and arrow.
692,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40,This is from the bow and arrow.
693,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90, GREG:  I don't know    what her feeling is
694,00:27:18.47,00:27:18.47,   because now it seems like  she wants to leave the island
695,00:27:20.87,00:27:20.87,   and see her girls.
696,00:27:21.87,00:27:21.87,This is going to make it that much easier
697,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73,   when I do get kicked off.
698,00:27:25.27,00:27:25.27,"   I'm going to probably cry,    but you know what?"
699,00:27:27.13,00:27:27.13,   Then I'm going to get off    and go...
700,00:27:28.30,00:27:28.30,"""What an adventure!"""
701,00:27:30.20,00:27:30.20,"And then I get to go home to my kids, so..."
702,00:27:32.17,00:27:32.17,GERVASE:  Jenna is a threat to me   because she has kids
703,00:27:34.47,00:27:34.47,"   and I have kids, so we're,  like, single parents,"
704,00:27:37.20,00:27:37.20,  and if people feel    for single parents
705,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13, and she's tugging on   people's emotions right there
706,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,"  and that can sway somebody  not to vote for Jenna,"
707,00:27:44.33,00:27:44.33,  and that's a threat for me.
708,00:27:45.90,00:27:45.90,Gervase? I don't see him doing very much.
709,00:27:52.30,00:27:52.30, SUSAN:    The fact you have   more people here now
710,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,  and we're having to forage   for more food
711,00:27:58.37,00:27:58.37,and there's a lot more slackers   on this other team.
712,00:28:02.53,00:28:02.53, SUSAN:    Gervase. He's a nice guy.
713,00:28:05.57,00:28:05.57,I don't like feed... I don't like feeding
714,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53,"people like that, though, you know what I mean?"
715,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53,Yeah.
716,00:28:09.73,00:28:09.73, That's where I'm...  That's where I'm  coming from now.
717,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,GERVASE:   My work philosophy is this:
718,00:28:14.07,00:28:14.07," Rich is, like,  the resident fisherman;"
719,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,  Rudy's the cook;
720,00:28:17.93,00:28:17.93, Sean is hauling in wood    every day--
721,00:28:19.50,00:28:19.50," you know, it seems like    everybody has a role here--"
722,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,  and I'm just sitting back     relaxing.
723,00:28:24.40,00:28:24.40,  Watch me-- I'm going to work   that boy till he's gone now.
724,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,  He bugs me.
725,00:28:28.50,00:28:28.50, GREG:   Gervase is honest.
726,00:28:29.90,00:28:29.90,  He's not playing
727,00:28:30.90,00:28:30.90, anybody else's game.
728,00:28:31.97,00:28:31.97, I've said over and over
729,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00, that he was an example
730,00:28:34.43,00:28:34.43,  for people    thrown out of their element
731,00:28:36.40,00:28:36.40,"   to really succeed and have a great time, which Gervase has."
732,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,   I got a king.
733,00:28:40.57,00:28:40.57,( laughing )
734,00:28:42.23,00:28:42.23,GERVASE:  How have I survived this long?
735,00:28:44.00,00:28:44.00,"I always said when I came here,"
736,00:28:45.77,00:28:45.77,  I was going to be     the entertainer.
737,00:28:47.13,00:28:47.13,The cards man-- I'm glad you brought them.
738,00:28:49.90,00:28:49.90,It adds a new dimension to island life.
739,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,GERVASE:  I'm not trying to do anything
740,00:28:54.83,00:28:54.83,   shifty or shady;    I'm just being me
741,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,   and people like me because that's who I am.
742,00:28:58.40,00:28:58.40," Gervase is not that charming,    trust me."
743,00:29:00.97,00:29:00.97," He's a slacker,"
744,00:29:02.23,00:29:02.23,  so he won't be around long.
745,00:29:12.53,00:29:12.53,Hey.
746,00:29:15.37,00:29:15.37,"   ""Pull me."""
747,00:29:16.93,00:29:16.93,"   Oh, look at this."
748,00:29:18.13,00:29:18.13,"  ""If you want to win immunity"
749,00:29:20.77,00:29:20.77,"""at the next challenge,"
750,00:29:22.80,00:29:22.80," just slip onto the right rope    and run."""
751,00:29:25.00,00:29:25.00," ""Beware of dead ends."
752,00:29:26.53,00:29:26.53," ""The prize you seek..."
753,00:29:28.17,00:29:28.17," ""is waiting..."
754,00:29:29.33,00:29:29.33,"at the end of the line."""
755,00:29:31.20,00:29:31.20,"Wow, that sounds hard."
756,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,A significant amount of luck with this one.
757,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,"Oh, you've got to love that."
758,00:29:38.47,00:29:38.47,"   At least this way, I have a chance."
759,00:29:40.93,00:29:40.93, JEFF:  Day 24 on the island.
760,00:29:42.93,00:29:42.93,"  Since the merger, nothing has been more important"
761,00:29:46.17,00:29:46.17, than voting strategy.
762,00:29:48.00,00:29:48.00,The gears are churning.
763,00:29:49.70,00:29:49.70,Nobody is safe.
764,00:29:51.20,00:29:51.20,  The only way to stay  in this game:
765,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,win today's immunity challenge.
766,00:30:02.60,00:30:02.60,JEFF: Here we are--
767,00:30:04.10,00:30:04.10,immunity time... again.
768,00:30:06.27,00:30:06.27,"""Into the Line"" is a rope course designed to be confusing."
769,00:30:09.70,00:30:09.70, It's a jungle rope maze with five checkpoints along the way.
770,00:30:13.77,00:30:13.77, Your job is to collect
771,00:30:15.83,00:30:15.83, the colored carabineers
772,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,  at every checkpoint.
773,00:30:18.20,00:30:18.20,Here's the only hiccup:
774,00:30:19.60,00:30:19.60,you have to be attached to the rope course at all times
775,00:30:22.07,00:30:22.07, with your carabineer  you have two of them.
776,00:30:23.83,00:30:23.83,"At certain points, you're going"
777,00:30:25.43,00:30:25.43,to come to a junction--   these trees.
778,00:30:26.77,00:30:26.77,You can't get past them.
779,00:30:28.10,00:30:28.10,"You have to take your other carabineer,"
780,00:30:29.63,00:30:29.63,  reattach...    then you can un-attach...
781,00:30:32.20,00:30:32.20,"   now spin around, maneuver,"
782,00:30:33.50,00:30:33.50,however you want to do it.
783,00:30:35.40,00:30:35.40, The only thing you have to keep in mind
784,00:30:37.43,00:30:37.43,is one of these    has to be on at all times.
785,00:30:39.60,00:30:39.60,Also at each checkpoint    are several ropes
786,00:30:42.00,00:30:42.00,   that lead directly
787,00:30:43.20,00:30:43.20," to the next checkpoint,"
788,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,   but several ropes    lead to dead ends.
789,00:30:46.80,00:30:46.80," If you hit a dead end,"
790,00:30:48.37,00:30:48.37, you've got to backtrack  to your last checkpoint
791,00:30:51.23,00:30:51.23, and choose a new line.
792,00:30:52.83,00:30:52.83,The first person  to reach the end of the course
793,00:30:55.27,00:30:55.27,  with five carabineers
794,00:30:56.53,00:30:56.53,gets immunity.
795,00:30:57.80,00:30:57.80,"The tighter, the better?"
796,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,"Survivors, ready..."
797,00:31:07.63,00:31:07.63,go!
798,00:32:27.23,00:32:27.23, What's happened to us?
799,00:32:29.10,00:32:29.10, We're idiots!
800,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,"Oh, dude."
801,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,  ( cheering )
802,00:32:36.67,00:32:36.67,"Nice work, man."
803,00:32:36.67,00:32:36.67,Wow!
804,00:32:38.70,00:32:38.70,Congratulations.
805,00:32:40.10,00:32:40.10,Give me five!
806,00:32:41.40,00:32:41.40,Yank it down.
807,00:32:41.40,00:32:41.40,Very good. Very good.
808,00:32:42.90,00:32:42.90,Yes!
809,00:32:43.93,00:32:43.93,Well earned.
810,00:32:45.70,00:32:45.70,  Yes!
811,00:33:25.37,00:33:25.37, KELLY:  I knew coming here that   we'd have to vote people off.
812,00:33:28.83,00:33:28.83, What I didn't bank on     was the feelings
813,00:33:31.03,00:33:31.03, that you'd have   towards these people.
814,00:33:33.93,00:33:33.93,  I feel like I feel   every Tribal Council
815,00:33:36.77,00:33:36.77,  only it gets worse    every time.
816,00:33:38.87,00:33:38.87,   I feel like a backstabber.
817,00:33:40.47,00:33:40.47,  I feel like a liar.
818,00:33:44.90,00:33:44.90,"God, some people    are so nervous, it's sick."
819,00:33:47.27,00:33:47.27, It's sick how nervous some people are.
820,00:33:49.53,00:33:49.53, RUDY:  People are all looking   around a little more
821,00:33:51.70,00:33:51.70," because it's starting     to get down to the wire,"
822,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33," and evidently,    we're the only ones"
823,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20, with a plan right now.
824,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,"Once it's past the next council,"
825,00:34:02.63,00:34:02.63,we're invincible.
826,00:34:04.10,00:34:04.10,Right now we're not invincible.
827,00:34:06.87,00:34:06.87, The voting now   should get very interesting.
828,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,"If people are fear- and   self-preservation motivated,"
829,00:34:11.63,00:34:11.63, they'll band together.
830,00:34:12.77,00:34:12.77, They'll form alliances.
831,00:34:14.33,00:34:14.33, They'll start beating    people out.
832,00:34:16.23,00:34:16.23, Fear-motivated     self-preservation
833,00:34:17.80,00:34:17.80,   is the worst game  I can imagine.
834,00:34:19.53,00:34:19.53," KELLY:  How do you, you know,   stay true to yourself"
835,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33, and maintain integrity
836,00:34:23.90,00:34:23.90,   and still play this game?
837,00:34:25.27,00:34:25.27, And you know what? You can't.
838,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,"Yeah, I think that would look better."
839,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70," Yeah, tell Rudy that."
840,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50, RUDY:  It's cut and dried that we can
841,00:34:35.43,00:34:35.43," eliminate somebody every time,     and if we don't,"
842,00:34:38.40,00:34:38.40,   I'll have to break somebody's kneecap or something.
843,00:34:41.73,00:34:41.73, SUSAN:  So as long as everybody  can keep their mouth shut now.
844,00:34:44.43,00:34:44.43,Kelly's a little freaky.
845,00:34:46.07,00:34:46.07,   She's gets a little going.
846,00:34:47.73,00:34:47.73,"  I'm like, ""Just shut up."
847,00:34:49.73,00:34:49.73," Just vote this, and shut up."""
848,00:34:52.53,00:34:52.53, KELLY:  I keep telling myself
849,00:34:54.10,00:34:54.10," ""Well, I have enough friends."
850,00:34:55.67,00:34:55.67,"   I didn't come here to make friends,"" and da-da-da."
851,00:34:58.00,00:34:58.00,"   And the truth is,   I like these people."
852,00:34:59.50,00:34:59.50,GERVASE:  This is a game.
853,00:35:01.00,00:35:01.00,  You're allowed to do this.
854,00:35:02.87,00:35:02.87, This is a game.
855,00:35:03.93,00:35:03.93,  Alliances are fair game.
856,00:35:06.20,00:35:06.20," My thing is, we should always   have the upper hand."
857,00:35:08.77,00:35:08.77,   We should've voted Rudy...
858,00:35:10.60,00:35:10.60,  We should have voted    for Rudy at first
859,00:35:12.67,00:35:12.67,"and then, next vote, vote your conscience."
860,00:35:15.57,00:35:15.57,   Always keep the upper hand
861,00:35:16.80,00:35:16.80," because if they try something, you can stop it."
862,00:35:19.30,00:35:19.30, SUSAN:  As far as there being     a counterstrategy
863,00:35:21.97,00:35:21.97,"   from the other side, yeah,  there is some fear about that"
864,00:35:24.43,00:35:24.43, because we haven't got  enough of them voted off yet.
865,00:35:26.87,00:35:26.87,"COLLEEN:  We have the upper hand right now, easy."
866,00:35:29.93,00:35:29.93,  We have four people   that we could come together
867,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"  have a vote, and get   the next person off."
868,00:36:26.10,00:36:26.10,   Welcome to Tribal Council  number eight.
869,00:36:28.70,00:36:28.70,You guys are now the final core group of nine.
870,00:36:31.40,00:36:31.40,"Two of you will make it, survive long enough to get"
871,00:36:34.93,00:36:34.93,to the final vote.
872,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,The other seven of you
873,00:36:37.47,00:36:37.47,will return to be the jury that delivers
874,00:36:39.77,00:36:39.77,"that vote, so no matter who gets voted off,"
875,00:36:42.77,00:36:42.77,"from this point forward, when they get voted off,"
876,00:36:44.93,00:36:44.93,we'll all be back here
877,00:36:46.33,00:36:46.33,in 15 days to determine who leaves with $1 million.
878,00:36:50.67,00:36:50.67,"  So, Richard,  bearing that in mind,"
879,00:36:52.97,00:36:52.97,how do you balance the ruthlessness
880,00:36:55.60,00:36:55.60,required to get
881,00:36:56.97,00:36:56.97,to the final two
882,00:36:58.73,00:36:58.73,   with the likability needed  to get the final vote?
883,00:37:03.47,00:37:03.47,Good question.
884,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,   I'm not even exactly sure  what my strategy's going to be
885,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,as to who I'm going to vote for    from week to week.
886,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,"I'm just going to keep getting fish,"
887,00:37:13.43,00:37:13.43,feeding people--   hope they're happy.
888,00:37:15.20,00:37:15.20,"How about you, Gervase?"
889,00:37:17.93,00:37:17.93,You're wearing immunity;   tonight you're fine.
890,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,   Same thing applies to you.
891,00:37:21.70,00:37:21.70, How do you find that balance?
892,00:37:23.43,00:37:23.43,Just... I'm winging it.
893,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,"  Every day out here,   I'm just winging it."
894,00:37:27.20,00:37:27.20,"I like everybody here, you know,"
895,00:37:29.43,00:37:29.43," and after seeing their videos    of their families,"
896,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,I can put faces with them now.
897,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,I see they have
898,00:37:34.30,00:37:34.30,"loved ones like I do caring about them,"
899,00:37:36.43,00:37:36.43,"   rooting for them,   so it makes it a lot harder."
900,00:37:39.13,00:37:39.13,"Jenna, how surprised were you last week"
901,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,to see Gretchen get voted off?
902,00:37:45.33,00:37:45.33, I was very surprised.
903,00:37:46.90,00:37:46.90,"  I would've thought she would  have made it to the final two,"
904,00:37:50.70,00:37:50.70,"  but when we merged, strategies had to shift"
905,00:37:53.40,00:37:53.40,"and it looked like they   were getting rid of leaders,"
906,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73," so, from here on out,   if I get voted off,"
907,00:37:59.30,00:37:59.30,  I'll wear it  like a badge of honor
908,00:38:01.33,00:38:01.33,when I walk down there.
909,00:38:03.10,00:38:03.10,"  Susan, straight up,  is there an alliance?"
910,00:38:05.90,00:38:05.90,"   No, not that I..."
911,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,"   I vote people off  that I don't care for,"
912,00:38:13.77,00:38:13.77,"  you know, that really would   irritate me if I was"
913,00:38:16.63,00:38:16.63,   working with them at a job or something like that.
914,00:38:19.40,00:38:19.40,"  Here, I got a chance    to vote them off."
915,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27, I can get rid of them.
916,00:38:22.60,00:38:22.60,"   It's, like, yeah!"
917,00:38:24.43,00:38:24.43,"Kelly, same question."
918,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57,  Do I have to answer?
919,00:38:28.23,00:38:28.23,   I'm just kidding.
920,00:38:29.60,00:38:29.60,Has your voting strategy changed now or will it change tonight?
921,00:38:35.43,00:38:35.43, I vote for who I don't    particularly like.
922,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,  I vote for who I don't want to spend the next 15 days with.
923,00:38:42.60,00:38:42.60,"Colleen, would you do whatever it takes"
924,00:38:44.70,00:38:44.70,to get this money?
925,00:38:45.90,00:38:45.90,Would you play sides against each other?
926,00:38:48.23,00:38:48.23,  No.
927,00:38:49.23,00:38:49.23,Just not important enough?
928,00:38:50.60,00:38:50.60, Right.
929,00:38:52.00,00:38:52.00, What brought you here  if it's not the money?
930,00:38:54.23,00:38:54.23,"I mean, I'm here"
931,00:38:55.37,00:38:55.37,"  for the money, too."
932,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"I mean, give me a break.    Of course."
933,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03, But the thing is that
934,00:38:59.40,00:38:59.40,"everybody's here for the money,    you know?"
935,00:39:01.40,00:39:01.40,I'm not going to listen    to everybody's sob stories
936,00:39:04.30,00:39:04.30,  and then weigh them.
937,00:39:05.30,00:39:05.30,   That's ridiculous.
938,00:39:06.30,00:39:06.30,Everybody wants the money.
939,00:39:09.10,00:39:09.10,  All right. Gervase?   It's time to vote.
940,00:39:23.27,00:39:23.27, My vote is for Jenna.
941,00:39:24.57,00:39:24.57,I think she's really missing her kids now.
942,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,She didn't get the videotape.
943,00:39:27.67,00:39:27.67,"There's not a letter for her,"
944,00:39:29.13,00:39:29.13," so, you know, I think it's really hurting her,"
945,00:39:31.73,00:39:31.73, so this is her ticket.
946,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,"Keeping with my strategy  of alphabetical order,"
947,00:39:47.60,00:39:47.60,  I'm voting for Greg tonight.
948,00:39:49.67,00:39:49.67,"   It would have been    Gervase's turn, but he won"
949,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,"immunity, so I had to skip him."
950,00:39:53.03,00:39:53.03, Next person in order is Greg.
951,00:39:54.60,00:39:54.60,   I don't think this vote is going to mean very much.
952,00:40:15.83,00:40:15.83,"First time for paranoia,    second time for irritation"
953,00:40:19.23,00:40:19.23, and third time because my ear infection is clearing up.
954,00:40:32.57,00:40:32.57,"   \xe2\x99\xaa Good night, sweetheart,    yeah, it's time to go. \xe2\x99\xaa"
955,00:40:37.77,00:40:37.77,No more competition.
956,00:40:39.90,00:40:39.90,"Talk to you later, Greg. Bye-bye."
957,00:40:57.47,00:40:57.47,"As always I'd like to remind you that once the votes are tallied,"
958,00:41:00.13,00:41:00.13, the decision is final
959,00:41:01.67,00:41:01.67,  and the person will be asked to leave the island immediately.
960,00:41:04.90,00:41:04.90,I'll read the votes.

983,00:42:48.40,00:42:48.40,When the tears fell.
984,00:42:49.50,00:42:49.50,Look at the tears back there.
985,00:42:51.07,00:42:51.07,   That's it  for tonight's Tribal Council.
986,00:42:54.33,00:42:54.33,  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
987,00:42:56.70,00:42:56.70,  Good night.
988,00:43:18.53,00:43:18.53, Next week on Survivor:
989,00:43:21.93,00:43:21.93,I'm just being honest.
990,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,If you can't take the honesty...
991,00:43:24.57,00:43:24.57, Cracks begin to appear     in the alliance.
992,00:43:26.67,00:43:26.67,  I'm hoping that Kelly hasn't
993,00:43:28.23,00:43:28.23, joined forces    with somebody else.
994,00:43:30.47,00:43:30.47,  Someone will win a letter     in the reward challenge.
995,00:43:33.50,00:43:33.50, Will Jenna finally hear    from her children?
996,00:43:35.53,00:43:35.53, JENNA:  I want the letter from home.
997,00:43:36.90,00:43:36.90,I haven't seen or heard anything from my kids.
998,00:43:45.40,00:43:45.40,A twist of fate that maybe some didn't expect
999,00:43:49.27,00:43:49.27,and some... well...
1000,00:43:50.27,00:43:50.27,some did.
1001,00:43:51.47,00:43:51.47," An excellent game,  well manufactured."
1002,00:43:53.90,00:43:53.90, I harbor no resentment  for any of you

1004,00:43:59.93,00:43:59.93, I feel like it's  probably a pretty  darn good time.
1005,00:44:03.13,00:44:03.13,"Thanks, guys."
