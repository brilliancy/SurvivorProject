1,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,"  JEFF PROBST: 16 Americans,  marooned for 39 days"
2,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:07.13,00:00:07.13,  Separated into two tribes--    Tagi and Pagong--
4,00:00:10.73,00:00:10.73,"  they competed against each other to remain on the island,"
5,00:00:14.03,00:00:14.03,  but now the tribes  have merged into one.
6,00:00:15.90,00:00:15.90," Rattana is the name,"
7,00:00:17.80,00:00:17.80,  and it is everyone for themselves.
8,00:00:20.57,00:00:20.57,"  Every third night,"
9,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,  the entire tribe will hike  deep into the jungle
10,00:00:24.10,00:00:24.10," to take part in the Tribal Council,"
11,00:00:26.10,00:00:26.10, where they must vote    one of their own
12,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03, off the island.
13,00:00:29.30,00:00:29.30,"  In the end, one will remain"
14,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
15,00:00:39.13,00:00:39.13, Last week on Survivor:
16,00:00:42.30,00:00:42.30, The stakes were raised    for the castaways
17,00:00:44.40,00:00:44.40,  as the two tribes    merged into one.
18,00:00:46.60,00:00:46.60, GREG:  There was a lot of baggage  that we left
19,00:00:50.10,00:00:50.10, on that Pagong beach.
20,00:00:51.77,00:00:51.77, JEFF: The members of Pagong   were upbeat
21,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,  as they paddled to their    new home at Tagi beach.
22,00:00:55.87,00:00:55.87,I'm excited to go to their camp  and meet new people.
23,00:00:58.63,00:00:58.63,"  Rich came out and was, like,  ""Hey, how are you?"""
24,00:01:01.47,00:01:01.47," You know, he swam out, which was really nice."
25,00:01:04.00,00:01:04.00,They welcomed us with open arms.
26,00:01:05.30,00:01:05.30, JEFF: But the Tagi alliance
27,00:01:06.60,00:01:06.60,was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
28,00:01:07.90,00:01:07.90,I don't need todeal with that.After Gretch?
29,00:01:10.30,00:01:10.30,Jenna.
30,00:01:10.30,00:01:10.30,Jenna.
31,00:01:11.63,00:01:11.63,I was thinking Sean.
32,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57, JEFF:  Rudy wasn't happy   with the new Rattana Tribe.
33,00:01:15.87,00:01:15.87," RUDY:  All of a sudden,   we doubled our population."
34,00:01:19.37,00:01:19.37,"  Personally,it's a pain in the ass."
35,00:01:20.57,00:01:20.57, JEFF:  Greg won the first
36,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,"  immunity talisman,"
37,00:01:23.60,00:01:23.60,ensuring that only he could notbe voted off at Tribal Council.
38,00:01:26.60,00:01:26.60,  Sean began  his alphabet voting strategy
39,00:01:29.63,00:01:29.63," and to the surprise of many,it was Gretchen who was ousted."
40,00:01:32.60,00:01:32.60,"Oh, my God."
41,00:01:34.07,00:01:34.07,It's me.
42,00:01:36.03,00:01:36.03, JEFF: Nine members of Rattana    are left.
43,00:01:38.00,00:01:38.00,"  Tonight, one more will go."
44,00:02:51.33,00:02:51.33," SEAN: Today is, like, Day 22."
45,00:02:54.10,00:02:54.10,"   We had a vote last night,  which is always pretty beat."
46,00:02:56.50,00:02:56.50, Always puts usin a pretty somber mood.
47,00:02:58.63,00:02:58.63,   But last night was  a very strange vote.
48,00:03:00.80,00:03:00.80,"  Last night, it looks  like there was a conspiracy,"
49,00:03:04.07,00:03:04.07,"  and maybe I'm being paranoidand I didn't want to believe it,"
50,00:03:08.47,00:03:08.47,"   but four people from Tagi  voted for Gretchen, I think."
51,00:03:12.33,00:03:12.33," SEAN: You know, the bloodbath  has begun, you know."
52,00:03:15.30,00:03:15.30," People have started taking ita different way,"
53,00:03:17.83,00:03:17.83, 'cause there's really no good   reason other than strategy
54,00:03:20.90,00:03:20.90, to vote Gretchen off.
55,00:03:25.50,00:03:25.50, GREG:  Gretchen distinctly disliked this part of the game.
56,00:03:28.57,00:03:28.57,   This was her hardest thing
57,00:03:30.23,00:03:30.23," was voting people off,"
58,00:03:31.77,00:03:31.77,  and the partthat she liked the most
59,00:03:33.97,00:03:33.97,was the survival aspect.
60,00:03:35.87,00:03:35.87,GERVASE:  I really don't know    what happened last night.
61,00:03:38.10,00:03:38.10," At first sight, it looks like they just picked Gretchen off."
62,00:03:40.90,00:03:40.90," SEAN:  I think that my former team, Tagi,"
63,00:03:43.73,00:03:43.73,  probably formed an alliance  against what they perceived
64,00:03:47.83,00:03:47.83,"   as her... as their  strongest member of Pagong,"
65,00:03:51.03,00:03:51.03,  which was Gretchen.
66,00:03:54.73,00:03:54.73,   It was my idea to get rid   of Gretchen because I...
67,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,  I thought that she was going to be the next leader.
68,00:04:00.83,00:04:00.83,  She had to go because she...
69,00:04:03.10,00:04:03.10,"  is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat."
70,00:04:08.17,00:04:08.17," SEAN:The, uh, duplicity of the whole  thing is pretty bad,"
71,00:04:11.80,00:04:11.80,  because I think that people went out of their way
72,00:04:13.87,00:04:13.87,"  to befriend her, and, uh..."
73,00:04:15.57,00:04:15.57, and those were the people whosubsequently voted against her.
74,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30," GREG:   That's the game--   duplicitous, sleaziness--"
75,00:04:21.20,00:04:21.20, if you want to play that way.
76,00:04:23.07,00:04:23.07, KELLY: This is a game;    don't take it personally.
77,00:04:24.90,00:04:24.90," You know, if people came here   to make, you know,"
78,00:04:27.20,00:04:27.20," bosom buddiesand, you know, lifelong friends,"
79,00:04:29.67,00:04:29.67,  they should've goneto summer camp.
80,00:04:31.57,00:04:31.57,"GERVASE:  I think, really,  if it happens again,"
81,00:04:35.60,00:04:35.60,"   then you can say for sure  there's an alliance,"
82,00:04:37.53,00:04:37.53,"but if it does, I'm more determined than ever"
83,00:04:39.70,00:04:39.70," to bust that plan up and stillkill them all and win, you know."
84,00:04:45.53,00:04:45.53,"   As far as Pagong,   we are now four."
85,00:04:47.07,00:04:47.07,   They are now five.
86,00:04:48.63,00:04:48.63,   They do have a voting bloc on us whether we see it or not
87,00:04:51.60,00:04:51.60,and they can pick us off  one by one.
88,00:04:53.50,00:04:53.50, Who needs men?
89,00:04:55.60,00:04:55.60,  My best strategy    is to bond with the women
90,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,   and try to hold on to the women's vote as long as I can.
91,00:05:03.57,00:05:03.57,"I'm so excited, guys."
92,00:05:06.53,00:05:06.53,I don't care if youvote me off now
93,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,'cause I made itto my cutoff point.
94,00:05:09.73,00:05:09.73,"The girls... no,there ain't no girls"
95,00:05:11.63,00:05:11.63,"going for a while,you guys."
96,00:05:13.40,00:05:13.40,"Thanks, Sue.That makes mefeel better."
97,00:05:16.57,00:05:16.57, SUSAN: The women seem    to be getting along well
98,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,  because the women    are all workers.
99,00:05:19.87,00:05:19.87," Actually, I like Jenna better than I thought I would."
100,00:05:22.60,00:05:22.60,"  I thought she would drive me  wild and she doesn't, so..."
101,00:05:25.57,00:05:25.57,Don't worry.
102,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,The guys' daysare numbered.
103,00:05:28.93,00:05:28.93,They are numbered.
104,00:05:30.43,00:05:30.43,"Us girls... us girls arehere for a while, trust me."
105,00:05:33.73,00:05:33.73,"Oh, man, I love it."
106,00:05:34.73,00:05:34.73,We'll be up at the end.
107,00:05:38.07,00:05:38.07, I do see the women versus men vote continuing on in Rattana.
108,00:05:40.97,00:05:40.97,"As far as my three votes, top--they're all men."
109,00:05:46.70,00:05:46.70,"Oh, God, you guys,look at these crabs."
110,00:05:49.80,00:05:49.80,"  I see women go out,   get the crab traps."
111,00:05:52.73,00:05:52.73, The women fix the hut.
112,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,  We're carrying the weight  of the team.
113,00:05:56.07,00:05:56.07," Maybe that's unfair,    but that's how I see it."
114,00:05:58.37,00:05:58.37,"Ooh, look at it."
115,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,  ( women screaming )
116,00:06:02.20,00:06:02.20,"Get him...get him, Sue."
117,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,Beat himwith the shoe.
118,00:06:07.60,00:06:07.60,   ( women laughing )
119,00:06:08.87,00:06:08.87,She had me beat thehell out of a crab
120,00:06:10.37,00:06:10.37,with a shoe.
121,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90," SUSAN:  As far as the women  becoming an alliance,"
122,00:06:14.83,00:06:14.83,there's a chance that the girls
123,00:06:16.40,00:06:16.40, might want to have an alliance
124,00:06:17.97,00:06:17.97, after there's a few more guys  knocked off.
125,00:06:19.93,00:06:19.93,"  If they do,   I'll just lead on with them"
126,00:06:21.97,00:06:21.97," like,   ""Yeah, that's a good idea."""
127,00:06:23.93,00:06:23.93, But as far as the women   forming an alliance
128,00:06:26.00,00:06:26.00,"  and making one, no."
129,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00, It ain't gonna happen.
130,00:06:28.20,00:06:28.20,  I already got mine.I like mine.
131,00:06:39.30,00:06:39.30, KELLY:  We're all hungry
132,00:06:42.37,00:06:42.37,"  and we're low on energy,  and there's still no one else"
133,00:06:45.30,00:06:45.30,  providing any food    except for Rich.
134,00:06:48.47,00:06:48.47,And we're having  to ration the rice.
135,00:06:49.70,00:06:49.70,You don't haveto put
136,00:06:51.27,00:06:51.27," both bowls on right now, Rudy,"
137,00:06:52.67,00:06:52.67,is whatI'm saying.
138,00:06:53.70,00:06:53.70,Don't bestubborn.
139,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87, RUDY:   I ain't stubborn.
140,00:06:55.87,00:06:55.87,I'm going to eat
141,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,if everybody'sgoing to eat.
142,00:06:58.60,00:06:58.60,"Okay, okay."
143,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67, I ain't above eating.
144,00:07:01.20,00:07:01.20,"  Having nine people,   it's, uh..."
145,00:07:03.47,00:07:03.47, everything gets smaller again.
146,00:07:05.27,00:07:05.27,"   The rice pot got smaller,"
147,00:07:07.07,00:07:07.07, the sleeping quarters  got smaller.
148,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,"We got four,five bags..."
149,00:07:10.70,00:07:10.70,"So it's four bags there,so we got eight meals there"
150,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,so that's four days.
151,00:07:14.53,00:07:14.53," Or, no, that's only two days."
152,00:07:17.30,00:07:17.30," So, a can's only going  to last us two days?"
153,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93,We're eating that much.
154,00:07:23.10,00:07:23.10,"We have to rationit, then."
155,00:07:24.73,00:07:24.73,So instead of makingthree pots tonight
156,00:07:28.63,00:07:28.63,we should make two pots  twice a day.
157,00:07:30.10,00:07:30.10,"RUDY:When we goover there to eat,"
158,00:07:31.37,00:07:31.37,the majority rules.
159,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,"Yeah, two pots."
160,00:07:33.70,00:07:33.70, SUSAN:I wish some of the other people
161,00:07:36.00,00:07:36.00, would start conserving    a little more...
162,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,  people that are being pigs.
163,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00, I'll only eat one bowl at a sitting.
164,00:07:41.50,00:07:41.50," I'm planning on staying until the end,"
165,00:07:43.63,00:07:43.63,  so I really want    to have something
166,00:07:45.20,00:07:45.20,  for the last couple of days.
167,00:08:17.20,00:08:17.20, We have our fisherman;   it's Rich.
168,00:08:18.60,00:08:18.60,  That's Rich's job.
169,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77," Oh, wow. Two?"
170,00:08:21.93,00:08:21.93,Four.
171,00:08:23.20,00:08:23.20, Four?
172,00:08:24.43,00:08:24.43, ( laughing ): What a catch.
173,00:08:25.73,00:08:25.73," A ray, a parrot fish,   a catfish"
174,00:08:28.00,00:08:28.00, and a nice little nurse shark.
175,00:08:29.50,00:08:29.50,Baby's gonna havesome protein today.
176,00:08:32.10,00:08:32.10,"GERVASE:  Greg showing up, going out trying to spear a fish."
177,00:08:36.37,00:08:36.37,  They've got nothing.
178,00:08:37.87,00:08:37.87,  I'm not going to do   any better than they will.
179,00:08:39.87,00:08:39.87,  And I think Rich is in a great position.
180,00:08:42.20,00:08:42.20,"  We vote Rich off,"
181,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47, we don't eat.
182,00:08:44.47,00:08:44.47,Get the torches going.
183,00:08:45.87,00:08:45.87,Get everythinghappening.
184,00:08:48.00,00:08:48.00,"This is big time,guys."
185,00:08:49.37,00:08:49.37,"Rich, Rich, Rich,Rich, Rich!"
186,00:08:53.60,00:08:53.60,"RICHARD:Now, which one ofyou sons of bitches"
187,00:08:55.77,00:08:55.77,wrote my nameon a cardlast night?
188,00:08:57.73,00:08:57.73,( laughing )
189,00:08:59.13,00:08:59.13, The bastard didn't geta fish.
190,00:09:00.43,00:09:00.43,"Yeah, he's out of here."
191,00:09:01.47,00:09:01.47, I'm starving.
192,00:09:02.63,00:09:02.63,RICHARD:  As far as who voted for me
193,00:09:04.23,00:09:04.23, at the Tribal Council  last night...
194,00:09:06.03,00:09:06.03, and I'm not certain who it is.
195,00:09:07.83,00:09:07.83,  I'm thinking  it was probably Greg
196,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,  who felt threatened by me.
197,00:09:12.80,00:09:12.80, But it could have been  any of them.
198,00:09:14.30,00:09:14.30,  I've only been with them  a day or two
199,00:09:16.47,00:09:16.47, and I'd not brought in    any fish.
200,00:09:18.30,00:09:18.30,"  Today, on the other hand   I brought in a huge catch."
201,00:09:21.80,00:09:21.80, Three rays...
202,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,   They just lapped that up.
203,00:09:25.77,00:09:25.77,That one'spretty meaty.
204,00:09:28.27,00:09:28.27,GREG:Let's makethem dead
205,00:09:29.27,00:09:29.27,so they canstop suffocating.
206,00:09:30.37,00:09:30.37, ( loud smack )
207,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67,Aah!
208,00:09:32.77,00:09:32.77,"You guys, I mean,"
209,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,there's no otherhumane way
210,00:09:35.73,00:09:35.73,to do that?
211,00:09:37.13,00:09:37.13, It seems humane to me.
212,00:09:38.33,00:09:38.33,Right through its brain.
213,00:09:39.90,00:09:39.90,  I could eat rice    for 17 more days.
214,00:09:41.70,00:09:41.70,"  I could eat rice    the whole time,"
215,00:09:43.27,00:09:43.27,  but they're loving the fish
216,00:09:44.80,00:09:44.80,"  and it seems to make people   feel great,"
217,00:09:46.30,00:09:46.30,   and I squeeze every ounceof credit out of it that I can.
218,00:09:50.70,00:09:50.70," Susie-Q, look at that, please."
219,00:09:52.43,00:09:52.43,"I know,I said"
220,00:09:53.80,00:09:53.80,they lookbeautiful.
221,00:09:55.00,00:09:55.00,"Dang, Rich!"
222,00:09:56.00,00:09:56.00,Those rayslook really good.
223,00:09:57.47,00:09:57.47,"We're all very proudof you, Richie."
224,00:09:59.47,00:09:59.47,   It's the most fish   we've had.
225,00:10:00.67,00:10:00.67, Good.
226,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,  Watch Susie perk up.
227,00:10:13.03,00:10:13.03, She just gets a little protein  and she's back in the race.
228,00:10:16.10,00:10:16.10, GREG:  Rich is playing a big game.
229,00:10:17.93,00:10:17.93,  I think Rich thinks    he's very clever.
230,00:10:19.63,00:10:19.63, He has a lot of things  going on in his mind
231,00:10:22.20,00:10:22.20," that he, uh..."
232,00:10:23.63,00:10:23.63,  selectively decides  what he will share
233,00:10:27.00,00:10:27.00, and with whom.
234,00:10:31.77,00:10:31.77,Fear... comes from...
235,00:10:32.97,00:10:32.97,That's right.
236,00:10:34.10,00:10:34.10, It's useless.
237,00:10:35.20,00:10:35.20,I think religion
238,00:10:36.50,00:10:36.50,is what destroysour society.
239,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,Whoa!
240,00:10:39.20,00:10:39.20,I think it's the reasonpeople treat
241,00:10:41.53,00:10:41.53,other people as if
242,00:10:43.13,00:10:43.13,they're lowerthan themselves.
243,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,"Rich, that'sground-shaking."
244,00:10:48.90,00:10:48.90,RICHARD: I'm not sure    how Greg sees me.
245,00:10:50.63,00:10:50.63,  I'm trying to figure out whether or not
246,00:10:52.87,00:10:52.87,  he's trying to build   an alliance or pull me in
247,00:10:54.97,00:10:54.97,or make me like him in some way.
248,00:10:57.10,00:10:57.10, GREG:  It's kind of weird.   It's good and bad.
249,00:10:58.67,00:10:58.67,You shouldgive it a go.
250,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,"RICHARD:Thank you, buddy."
251,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90,Don't get thatstuff near me
252,00:11:05.10,00:11:05.10,with those funny faces.
253,00:11:06.83,00:11:06.83, JENNA: I'm seeing Greg  in a more devious way
254,00:11:08.03,00:11:08.03,than I've ever seen him before.
255,00:11:09.40,00:11:09.40," Since we moved,"
256,00:11:10.47,00:11:10.47,"   I saw him change so much,"
257,00:11:13.90,00:11:13.90," and so transparently, to me anyway,"
258,00:11:17.10,00:11:17.10,   that I've changedmy whole attitude towards Greg.
259,00:11:19.83,00:11:19.83, GREG:  This scheme is interesting
260,00:11:22.30,00:11:22.30,"  in that you make friends  with people,"
261,00:11:24.93,00:11:24.93,  you make alliances
262,00:11:26.67,00:11:26.67,and you have to cut them loose at some point.
263,00:11:28.73,00:11:28.73, JENNA:  Greg is working just about everybody in the group.
264,00:11:32.03,00:11:32.03,I think he's always had Colleen
265,00:11:34.23,00:11:34.23, wrapped around   his little finger.
266,00:11:35.40,00:11:35.40,  It's not like that.
267,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,"   I mean, honestly,if there was a girl here"
268,00:11:39.27,00:11:39.27," who I got along with  really, really well,"
269,00:11:41.53,00:11:41.53,  it would be the same thing    that way.
270,00:11:43.33,00:11:43.33, I feel
271,00:11:44.43,00:11:44.43,  like I have a friend
272,00:11:45.90,00:11:45.90,  and I have somebody who's my equal
273,00:11:47.40,00:11:47.40,  that I can actually   have a conversation with.
274,00:11:49.07,00:11:49.07,Yesterdaynight...
275,00:11:51.43,00:11:51.43, I'm voting for you next time.
276,00:11:53.33,00:11:53.33,Fine. Seewhat happens.
277,00:11:55.67,00:11:55.67,You're votingfor me.
278,00:11:57.80,00:11:57.80, GREG:  This is the game.
279,00:11:59.77,00:11:59.77,   You bringthis little kitty along.
280,00:12:00.83,00:12:00.83,"  You have your little kitten,"
281,00:12:02.47,00:12:02.47, and you pet your kitten    and you enjoy this kitten
282,00:12:04.57,00:12:04.57, and the kitten sleeps with you   every night
283,00:12:06.43,00:12:06.43," and then, you're hungry, man."
284,00:12:08.13,00:12:08.13, You look right  in the kitten's eye
285,00:12:09.63,00:12:09.63,   and snap its neck.
286,00:12:10.83,00:12:10.83, It's nothing personal. You're hungry.
287,00:12:12.23,00:12:12.23,The kitten has to give its life  for the next level.
288,00:12:14.43,00:12:14.43, What is it about your pet cat?
289,00:12:16.77,00:12:16.77,My petkitten?
290,00:12:18.00,00:12:18.00,Your pet kitten.
291,00:12:19.43,00:12:19.43,"It's you,kitty."
292,00:12:20.60,00:12:20.60, KELLY:I see him as being a chameleon.
293,00:12:22.93,00:12:22.93,   Changing his colors to fit  whoever he's around.
294,00:12:26.93,00:12:26.93,RICHARD:  He's certainly interacted with me
295,00:12:29.70,00:12:29.70,  in an incredibly    interesting way
296,00:12:31.53,00:12:31.53,  that suggests to me   that he's trying something
297,00:12:33.90,00:12:33.90,"  that I'm very, very wary of   and that's great."
298,00:12:37.40,00:12:37.40," JENNA:  Rich finds Greg attractive,"
299,00:12:40.17,00:12:40.17, so Rich throws these   little innuendoes out there
300,00:12:42.73,00:12:42.73,"and Greg will just pick right upon them,"
301,00:12:44.97,00:12:44.97,  sit right real close to Rich and he's playing him.
302,00:12:50.57,00:12:50.57,"  Orgy, Greg?"
303,00:12:51.57,00:12:51.57,Orgy?
304,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,Yeah.
305,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,Sure.
306,00:12:53.57,00:12:53.57,Have...You have?
307,00:12:54.57,00:12:54.57,"Oh, not right now?"
308,00:12:55.60,00:12:55.60,He thought it wasan offer.
309,00:12:57.40,00:12:57.40,   GERVASE:Greg and Rich have joked around a lot.
310,00:12:59.20,00:12:59.20,  We were talking one night.
311,00:13:00.60,00:13:00.60, Rich was getting real personal
312,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,"  about his business,and Greg was all in it."
313,00:13:04.83,00:13:04.83,You guys have never been   with another guy?
314,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,No.
315,00:13:08.73,00:13:08.73,Greg has.
316,00:13:09.73,00:13:09.73,I mean...
317,00:13:10.73,00:13:10.73,"Rich, seriously?"
318,00:13:12.13,00:13:12.13, Just kid... kid stuff.
319,00:13:13.30,00:13:13.30,That's whatfreaks me out.
320,00:13:15.10,00:13:15.10,I mean...well...I mean...
321,00:13:16.17,00:13:16.17,"No, I...You..."
322,00:13:18.13,00:13:18.13," GREG: I think, uh, Rich likes    to flirt with everybody,"
323,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"and instead of directly   shutting him down,"
324,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,  I only played his game back.
325,00:13:25.60,00:13:25.60,He's the shy oneon tape.
326,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83, I didn't expect that.
327,00:13:27.97,00:13:27.97, I'll tell you the story later.
328,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,   RICHARD:  He's manipulative.
329,00:13:31.67,00:13:31.67,  He's trying to win me over  in some way.
330,00:13:34.10,00:13:34.10,He's just not going about it in bright enough a way for me.
331,00:13:37.90,00:13:37.90,"I would like to spend more time with him and get to know him,"
332,00:13:40.23,00:13:40.23,but... I would also rather have  the million dollars
333,00:13:42.33,00:13:42.33, than to have somebodylike him around to worry about.
334,00:14:05.33,00:14:05.33,"Oh, gee."
335,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17, What the hell is that?
336,00:14:10.00,00:14:10.00,"Oh, boy."
337,00:14:12.27,00:14:12.27,"Oh, no way."
338,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17,"""It takes skill   to carve the arc."
339,00:14:15.87,00:14:15.87," ""May your aim be true   and find its mark."
340,00:14:17.67,00:14:17.67,"""Archery is the sport of kings."
341,00:14:19.40,00:14:19.40," A reward from home is what victory brings."""
342,00:14:22.03,00:14:22.03,"  Oh, my, my."
343,00:14:23.03,00:14:23.03,I'm never goingto win anything
344,00:14:25.33,00:14:25.33, ( laughing ): around here.
345,00:14:27.43,00:14:27.43,Got a little bitof a clue.
346,00:14:27.43,00:14:27.43,Bows and arrows.
347,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57," SEAN:  You know, if it has"
348,00:14:30.70,00:14:30.70,"anything to dowith something from home,"
349,00:14:32.60,00:14:32.60,I'd like Jennato win it.
350,00:14:33.80,00:14:33.80,"Thank you, Sean."
351,00:14:34.87,00:14:34.87,I hope it'smy pictures.
352,00:14:35.87,00:14:35.87,They might haveour family send
353,00:14:37.30,00:14:37.30,a care package...everybody.
354,00:14:38.60,00:14:38.60,They'll just give youthe care package...
355,00:14:40.60,00:14:40.60,KELLY:  The reward is going    to be something from home
356,00:14:43.03,00:14:43.03,"  and, um, Jenna's thinking it's-it's our pictures"
357,00:14:45.40,00:14:45.40,"that we got to bring, and, like, she really, really..."
358,00:14:48.40,00:14:48.40,She misses her daughters   terribly.
359,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03,  Aren't you excited?
360,00:14:51.10,00:14:51.10,   I love this stuff.
361,00:14:52.97,00:14:52.97,"  I'm going to go home  and be, like,"
362,00:14:54.63,00:14:54.63," ""Oh, I got to do bows  and arrows."""
363,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07,SUSAN:Wow.
364,00:14:58.40,00:14:58.40,"Okay, Jenna,way over."
365,00:14:58.40,00:14:58.40,   Too high.
366,00:14:59.87,00:14:59.87,Is that how you hold it?
367,00:15:01.93,00:15:01.93,( laughing ):Oh.
368,00:15:03.17,00:15:03.17,"SUSAN: It's guys against girls, too,"
369,00:15:05.07,00:15:05.07,'cause thisis very even
370,00:15:06.17,00:15:06.17,because thesebow and arrows...
371,00:15:07.50,00:15:07.50,and thesearrows are...
372,00:15:08.57,00:15:08.57,  none of them are straight.
373,00:15:10.23,00:15:10.23,"Go, Kelly."
374,00:15:11.23,00:15:11.23,Keep yourfinger over it.
375,00:15:12.50,00:15:12.50,"Okay, put thestring up."
376,00:15:14.47,00:15:14.47,"Now, pull her."
377,00:15:15.73,00:15:15.73,Even if you want to
378,00:15:17.43,00:15:17.43,  keep it at a angle.
379,00:15:21.37,00:15:21.37,"Nice, Rudy."
380,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,Who's on the boat?
381,00:15:34.07,00:15:34.07,I think it's Jeff.
382,00:15:35.27,00:15:35.27,RICHARD: Bringing news
383,00:15:36.67,00:15:36.67,"   of the competition, I bet."
384,00:15:38.03,00:15:38.03,"Oh, hi, Jeff."
385,00:15:41.23,00:15:41.23, It better be something  really good.
386,00:15:43.17,00:15:43.17,  I'd rather have food than anything
387,00:15:44.70,00:15:44.70,from home right now.
388,00:15:45.93,00:15:45.93,I would so muchrather have food.
389,00:15:47.73,00:15:47.73,"It probably is a refrigerator,"
390,00:15:49.47,00:15:49.47,"but what are we goingto refrigerate, our rice?"
391,00:15:52.13,00:15:52.13,Maybe it's gotfood already.
392,00:15:53.53,00:15:53.53,It's ice creamsandwiches.
393,00:15:54.93,00:15:54.93,Okay.
394,00:15:55.93,00:15:55.93,( chuckles )
395,00:15:57.60,00:15:57.60,Move the crate.
396,00:15:58.60,00:15:58.60,Perfect.
397,00:16:04.50,00:16:04.50,Oh... a TV.
398,00:16:06.10,00:16:06.10,"Okay, now, beforewe begin today'sreward challenge,"
399,00:16:08.73,00:16:08.73,I'm going to show yousome short clips of video
400,00:16:11.13,00:16:11.13,sent from home.

404,00:16:16.67,00:16:16.67,With that...
405,00:16:18.40,00:16:18.40,"I give you this, a little something from home."

594,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,JEFF:So Greg is goingback up there
595,00:22:56.83,00:22:56.83,and watch his tape.
596,00:22:58.03,00:22:58.03,You can includethese guys if you want.
597,00:22:59.53,00:22:59.53,You can do whateveryou want with it.
598,00:23:00.60,00:23:00.60,   Of course.
599,00:23:01.63,00:23:01.63,"  If it's going to be funny,"
600,00:23:02.93,00:23:02.93,"  which I figured it would,"
601,00:23:04.43,00:23:04.43,  I thought other people might get a kick out of it.
602,00:23:06.47,00:23:06.47,   At least she could provideentertainment for other people.
603,00:23:08.97,00:23:08.97," Mukaluka, mau-mau, ping-ping."
604,00:23:11.47,00:23:11.47,  ( clicking tongue )
605,00:23:13.13,00:23:13.13,   How are you doing?
606,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13, I miss you very much.

608,00:23:18.87,00:23:18.87,"That's right, ping-ping."
609,00:23:20.60,00:23:20.60,RICHARD:  I didn't think Greg's tape  was unusual.
610,00:23:23.83,00:23:23.83, I expected that
611,00:23:24.97,00:23:24.97, and was excited by it.
612,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50, You could tell
613,00:23:27.50,00:23:27.50,  she was having fun
614,00:23:29.00,00:23:29.00, and knew he would laugh  at what she was doing
615,00:23:30.67,00:23:30.67,  and I was laughing.   I loved it.
616,00:23:32.60,00:23:32.60,"Any circumstance you find yourself in,"
617,00:23:35.20,00:23:35.20,  you're not sure what to do-- you're in a quandary;
618,00:23:37.33,00:23:37.33,  you're in a pickle;
619,00:23:39.10,00:23:39.10,   you're in a bind;
620,00:23:40.30,00:23:40.30,think what Billy Joel would do.
621,00:23:42.17,00:23:42.17,Think about it.
622,00:23:43.23,00:23:43.23,  ( laughing )
623,00:23:44.73,00:23:44.73,"Think, what would Billy Joel do?"
624,00:23:51.37,00:23:51.37,   Anything.
625,00:23:53.43,00:23:53.43,Let's talk about who's probably
626,00:23:55.00,00:23:55.00, sleeping on the island   right now.
627,00:23:56.43,00:23:56.43," All the giant,"
628,00:23:58.33,00:23:58.33,  scary spiders are sleeping.
629,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80, That's how mom used to put us   to sleep at night.
630,00:24:03.00,00:24:03.00, All the animals are sleeping.
631,00:24:04.57,00:24:04.57,  You make Mom proud.
632,00:24:06.03,00:24:06.03,You make Mom real proud.
633,00:24:17.77,00:24:17.77,  Just remember who loves you.
634,00:24:19.07,00:24:19.07,Sis-sis.
635,00:24:20.40,00:24:20.40,   ( kissing sounds )
636,00:24:22.60,00:24:22.60,   ( silly grunting )
637,00:24:26.43,00:24:26.43, SEAN: I definitely see Greg differently now
638,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53, after seeing his video
639,00:24:29.90,00:24:29.90,and attaching a lit bit of a family with him.
640,00:24:31.20,00:24:31.20,At least we know
641,00:24:32.57,00:24:32.57,  he's not the only screwball in his family.
642,00:24:34.30,00:24:34.30,   Maybe it's a genetic trait  over there.
643,00:24:35.67,00:24:35.67,"You're on, buddy."
644,00:24:35.67,00:24:35.67,Okay.
645,00:24:37.50,00:24:37.50,"   Hi, Julie."
646,00:24:38.97,00:24:38.97,"  I just want to say,   you know,"
647,00:24:40.57,00:24:40.57, it was really special
648,00:24:42.00,00:24:42.00,for you to send me
649,00:24:43.40,00:24:43.40,and everybody herewhat you did.
650,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,We feel like we could feel you
651,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,and we felt you.
652,00:24:48.73,00:24:48.73,Some of us felt you
653,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,and others just imagined  what it's like to feel you.
654,00:24:52.97,00:24:52.97, RUDY:  I can't understand a guytalking to his sister that way.
655,00:24:56.17,00:24:56.17,"  It sounded like Greg  was talking, maybe, incest."
656,00:24:59.40,00:24:59.40,That's the way it sounded to me.
657,00:25:01.87,00:25:01.87,  ( laughing )
658,00:25:02.90,00:25:02.90,Why not make allusions?
659,00:25:04.23,00:25:04.23, It crosses all those borders.
660,00:25:06.23,00:25:06.23,"   And, God, what are peoplegoing to think?"
661,00:25:08.50,00:25:08.50,"  And then, sexual allusions for my sister?"
662,00:25:11.10,00:25:11.10,  What's gonna happen?
663,00:25:12.60,00:25:12.60," Julie, we got to put up with this for about two more weeks"
664,00:25:15.60,00:25:15.60,"and, uh, then wemight kill him."
665,00:25:18.30,00:25:18.30,Is that doingyou a favor?
666,00:25:20.63,00:25:20.63,  ( laughing )
667,00:25:22.37,00:25:22.37,"Good work, Rudy."
668,00:25:23.93,00:25:23.93,"Good job, Rudy."
669,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,RUDY:Yeah.
670,00:25:34.00,00:25:34.00, JENNA: I can't imagine
671,00:25:35.57,00:25:35.57,  anybody missing their kids   more than I do every night.
672,00:25:41.97,00:25:41.97,   Miss my beauties.
673,00:25:44.30,00:25:44.30,Miss Sadie and Sabrina.
674,00:25:49.93,00:25:49.93, I can't imagine my mom    not getting the tape out.
675,00:25:53.23,00:25:53.23,It would've done wonders to see that my kids are okay.
676,00:25:57.97,00:25:57.97, To hear their voices.
677,00:26:01.90,00:26:01.90," To hear, ""I love you, Mommy."""
678,00:26:37.47,00:26:37.47,RICHARD:  Yesterday was cool.
679,00:26:38.93,00:26:38.93, We had that reward challenge with the bow and arrow
680,00:26:41.67,00:26:41.67," and the reward was, the, uh..."
681,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43," videotapes from home,"
682,00:26:45.17,00:26:45.17,"  and for me, that was way better than food."
683,00:26:48.33,00:26:48.33,"GERVASE:  Now, seeing those videos ofeverybody's family, it's, like,"
684,00:26:50.97,00:26:50.97,"  even if you didn't  like somebody before,"
685,00:26:52.93,00:26:52.93," you see that somebody  cares and loves this person,"
686,00:26:55.87,00:26:55.87, so it makes it harder for me    to boot somebody off now.
687,00:27:02.70,00:27:02.70, KELLY:  I felt so bad for Jenna.
688,00:27:04.27,00:27:04.27,  She practiced all morning  on that stupid bow and arrow
689,00:27:06.80,00:27:06.80,"  and then it was just, like, ""Why bother"" for her."
690,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,  Those are my bruisesfrom the bow and arrow.
691,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40,This is from the bow and arrow.
692,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90, GREG: I don't know   what her feeling is
693,00:27:18.47,00:27:18.47,   because now it seems like she wants to leave the island
694,00:27:20.87,00:27:20.87,   and see her girls.
695,00:27:21.87,00:27:21.87,This is going to make itthat much easier
696,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73,   when I do get kicked off.
697,00:27:25.27,00:27:25.27,"   I'm going to probably cry,   but you know what?"
698,00:27:27.13,00:27:27.13,   Then I'm going to get off   and go...
699,00:27:28.30,00:27:28.30,"""What an adventure!"""
700,00:27:30.20,00:27:30.20,"And then I get to go hometo my kids, so..."
701,00:27:32.17,00:27:32.17,GERVASE: Jenna is a threat to me  because she has kids
702,00:27:34.47,00:27:34.47,"   and I have kids, so we're, like, single parents,"
703,00:27:37.20,00:27:37.20,  and if people feel   for single parents
704,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13, and she's tugging on  people's emotions right there
705,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,"  and that can sway somebody not to vote for Jenna,"
706,00:27:44.33,00:27:44.33,  and that's a threat for me.
707,00:27:45.90,00:27:45.90,Gervase? I don't see himdoing very much.
708,00:27:52.30,00:27:52.30, SUSAN:  The fact you have  more people here now
709,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,  and we're having to forage  for more food
710,00:27:58.37,00:27:58.37,and there's a lot more slackers  on this other team.
711,00:28:02.53,00:28:02.53, SUSAN:  Gervase. He's a nice guy.
712,00:28:05.57,00:28:05.57,I don't like feed...I don't like feeding
713,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53,"people like that,though, you knowwhat I mean?"
714,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53,Yeah.
715,00:28:09.73,00:28:09.73, That's where I'm... That's where I'm coming from now.
716,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,GERVASE:  My work philosophy is this:
717,00:28:14.07,00:28:14.07," Rich is, like, the resident fisherman;"
718,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,  Rudy's the cook;
719,00:28:17.93,00:28:17.93, Sean is hauling in wood   every day--
720,00:28:19.50,00:28:19.50," you know, it seems like   everybody has a role here--"
721,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,  and I'm just sitting back    relaxing.
722,00:28:24.40,00:28:24.40,  Watch me-- I'm going to work  that boy till he's gone now.
723,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,  He bugs me.
724,00:28:28.50,00:28:28.50, GREG:  Gervase is honest.
725,00:28:29.90,00:28:29.90,  He's not playing
726,00:28:30.90,00:28:30.90, anybody else's game.
727,00:28:31.97,00:28:31.97, I've said over and over
728,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00, that he was an example
729,00:28:34.43,00:28:34.43,  for people   thrown out of their element
730,00:28:36.40,00:28:36.40,"   to really succeed and havea great time, which Gervase has."
731,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,   I got a king.
732,00:28:40.57,00:28:40.57,( laughing )
733,00:28:42.23,00:28:42.23,GERVASE: How have I survived this long?
734,00:28:44.00,00:28:44.00,"I always said when I came here,"
735,00:28:45.77,00:28:45.77,  I was going to be    the entertainer.
736,00:28:47.13,00:28:47.13,The cards man--I'm glad you brought them.
737,00:28:49.90,00:28:49.90,It adds a new dimensionto island life.
738,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,GERVASE: I'm not trying to do anything
739,00:28:54.83,00:28:54.83,   shifty or shady;   I'm just being me
740,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,   and people like mebecause that's who I am.
741,00:28:58.40,00:28:58.40," Gervase is not that charming,   trust me."
742,00:29:00.97,00:29:00.97," He's a slacker,"
743,00:29:02.23,00:29:02.23,  so he won't be around long.
744,00:29:12.53,00:29:12.53,Hey.
745,00:29:15.37,00:29:15.37,"   ""Pull me."""
746,00:29:16.93,00:29:16.93,"   Oh, look at this."
747,00:29:18.13,00:29:18.13,"  ""If you want to win immunity"

753,00:29:29.33,00:29:29.33,"at the end of the line."""
754,00:29:31.20,00:29:31.20,"Wow, thatsounds hard."
755,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,A significant amount of luckwith this one.
756,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,"Oh, you've gotto love that."
757,00:29:38.47,00:29:38.47,"   At least this way,I have a chance."
758,00:29:40.93,00:29:40.93, JEFF: Day 24 on the island.
759,00:29:42.93,00:29:42.93,"  Since the merger,nothing has been more important"
760,00:29:46.17,00:29:46.17, than voting strategy.
761,00:29:48.00,00:29:48.00,The gears are churning.
762,00:29:49.70,00:29:49.70,Nobody is safe.
763,00:29:51.20,00:29:51.20,  The only way to stay in this game:
764,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,win today's immunity challenge.
765,00:30:02.60,00:30:02.60,JEFF:Here we are--
766,00:30:04.10,00:30:04.10,immunity time... again.
767,00:30:06.27,00:30:06.27,"""Into the Line"" is a rope coursedesigned to be confusing."
768,00:30:09.70,00:30:09.70, It's a jungle rope maze withfive checkpoints along the way.
769,00:30:13.77,00:30:13.77, Your job is to collect
770,00:30:15.83,00:30:15.83, the colored carabineers
771,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,  at every checkpoint.
772,00:30:18.20,00:30:18.20,Here's the only hiccup:
773,00:30:19.60,00:30:19.60,you have to be attachedto the rope course at all times
774,00:30:22.07,00:30:22.07, with your carabineer you have two of them.
775,00:30:23.83,00:30:23.83,"At certain points, you're going"
776,00:30:25.43,00:30:25.43,to come to a junction--  these trees.
777,00:30:26.77,00:30:26.77,You can't get past them.
778,00:30:28.10,00:30:28.10,"You have to take yourother carabineer,"
779,00:30:29.63,00:30:29.63,  reattach...   then you can un-attach...
780,00:30:32.20,00:30:32.20,"   now spin around, maneuver,"
781,00:30:33.50,00:30:33.50,however you want to do it.
782,00:30:35.40,00:30:35.40, The only thingyou have to keep in mind
783,00:30:37.43,00:30:37.43,is one of these   has to be on at all times.
784,00:30:39.60,00:30:39.60,Also at each checkpoint   are several ropes
785,00:30:42.00,00:30:42.00,   that lead directly
786,00:30:43.20,00:30:43.20," to the next checkpoint,"
787,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,   but several ropes   lead to dead ends.
788,00:30:46.80,00:30:46.80," If you hit a dead end,"
789,00:30:48.37,00:30:48.37, you've got to backtrack to your last checkpoint
790,00:30:51.23,00:30:51.23, and choose a new line.
791,00:30:52.83,00:30:52.83,The first person to reach the end of the course
792,00:30:55.27,00:30:55.27,  with five carabineers
793,00:30:56.53,00:30:56.53,gets immunity.
794,00:30:57.80,00:30:57.80,"The tighter, the better?"
795,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,"Survivors, ready..."
796,00:31:07.63,00:31:07.63,go!
797,00:32:27.23,00:32:27.23, What's happened to us?
798,00:32:29.10,00:32:29.10, We're idiots!
799,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,"Oh, dude."
800,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,  ( cheering )
801,00:32:36.67,00:32:36.67,"Nice work, man."
802,00:32:36.67,00:32:36.67,Wow!
803,00:32:38.70,00:32:38.70,Congratulations.
804,00:32:40.10,00:32:40.10,Give me five!
805,00:32:41.40,00:32:41.40,Yank it down.
806,00:32:41.40,00:32:41.40,Very good. Very good.
807,00:32:42.90,00:32:42.90,Yes!
808,00:32:43.93,00:32:43.93,Well earned.
809,00:32:45.70,00:32:45.70,  Yes!
810,00:33:25.37,00:33:25.37, KELLY: I knew coming here that  we'd have to vote people off.
811,00:33:28.83,00:33:28.83, What I didn't bank on    was the feelings
812,00:33:31.03,00:33:31.03, that you'd have  towards these people.
813,00:33:33.93,00:33:33.93,  I feel like I feel  every Tribal Council
814,00:33:36.77,00:33:36.77,  only it gets worse   every time.
815,00:33:38.87,00:33:38.87,   I feel like a backstabber.
816,00:33:40.47,00:33:40.47,  I feel like a liar.
817,00:33:44.90,00:33:44.90,"God, some people   are so nervous, it's sick."
818,00:33:47.27,00:33:47.27, It's sick how nervoussome people are.
819,00:33:49.53,00:33:49.53, RUDY: People are all looking  around a little more
820,00:33:51.70,00:33:51.70," because it's starting    to get down to the wire,"
821,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33," and evidently,   we're the only ones"
822,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20, with a plan right now.
823,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,"Once it's past thenext council,"
824,00:34:02.63,00:34:02.63,we're invincible.
825,00:34:04.10,00:34:04.10,Right now we'renot invincible.
826,00:34:06.87,00:34:06.87, The voting now  should get very interesting.
827,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,"If people are fear- and  self-preservation motivated,"
828,00:34:11.63,00:34:11.63, they'll band together.
829,00:34:12.77,00:34:12.77, They'll form alliances.
830,00:34:14.33,00:34:14.33, They'll start beating   people out.
831,00:34:16.23,00:34:16.23, Fear-motivated    self-preservation
832,00:34:17.80,00:34:17.80,   is the worst game I can imagine.
833,00:34:19.53,00:34:19.53," KELLY: How do you, you know,  stay true to yourself"
834,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33, and maintain integrity
835,00:34:23.90,00:34:23.90,   and still play this game?
836,00:34:25.27,00:34:25.27, And you know what? You can't.
837,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,"Yeah, I think thatwould look better."
838,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70," Yeah, tell Rudy that."
839,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50, RUDY: It's cut and dried that we can
840,00:34:35.43,00:34:35.43," eliminate somebody every time,    and if we don't,"
841,00:34:38.40,00:34:38.40,   I'll have to breaksomebody's kneecap or something.
842,00:34:41.73,00:34:41.73, SUSAN: So as long as everybody can keep their mouth shut now.
843,00:34:44.43,00:34:44.43,Kelly's a little freaky.
844,00:34:46.07,00:34:46.07,   She's gets a little going.
845,00:34:47.73,00:34:47.73,"  I'm like, ""Just shut up."
846,00:34:49.73,00:34:49.73," Just vote this, and shut up."""
847,00:34:52.53,00:34:52.53, KELLY: I keep telling myself
848,00:34:54.10,00:34:54.10," ""Well, I have enough friends."
849,00:34:55.67,00:34:55.67,"   I didn't come hereto make friends,"" and da-da-da."
850,00:34:58.00,00:34:58.00,"   And the truth is,  I like these people."
851,00:34:59.50,00:34:59.50,GERVASE: This is a game.
852,00:35:01.00,00:35:01.00,  You're allowed to do this.
853,00:35:02.87,00:35:02.87, This is a game.
854,00:35:03.93,00:35:03.93,  Alliances are fair game.
855,00:35:06.20,00:35:06.20," My thing is, we should always  have the upper hand."
856,00:35:08.77,00:35:08.77,   We should've voted Rudy...
857,00:35:10.60,00:35:10.60,  We should have voted   for Rudy at first
858,00:35:12.67,00:35:12.67,"and then, next vote,vote your conscience."
859,00:35:15.57,00:35:15.57,   Always keep the upper hand
860,00:35:16.80,00:35:16.80," because if they try something,you can stop it."
861,00:35:19.30,00:35:19.30, SUSAN: As far as there being    a counterstrategy
862,00:35:21.97,00:35:21.97,"   from the other side, yeah, there is some fear about that"
863,00:35:24.43,00:35:24.43, because we haven't got enough of them voted off yet.
864,00:35:26.87,00:35:26.87,"COLLEEN: We havethe upper hand right now, easy."
865,00:35:29.93,00:35:29.93,  We have four people  that we could come together
866,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"  have a vote, and get  the next person off."
867,00:36:26.10,00:36:26.10,   Welcome to Tribal Council number eight.
868,00:36:28.70,00:36:28.70,You guys are nowthe final core group of nine.
869,00:36:31.40,00:36:31.40,"Two of you will make it,survive long enough to get"
870,00:36:34.93,00:36:34.93,to the final vote.
871,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,The other seven of you
872,00:36:37.47,00:36:37.47,will return to bethe jury that delivers
873,00:36:39.77,00:36:39.77,"that vote, so no matterwho gets voted off,"
874,00:36:42.77,00:36:42.77,"from this point forward,when they get voted off,"
875,00:36:44.93,00:36:44.93,we'll all be back here
876,00:36:46.33,00:36:46.33,in 15 days to determinewho leaves with $1 million.
877,00:36:50.67,00:36:50.67,"  So, Richard, bearing that in mind,"
878,00:36:52.97,00:36:52.97,how do you balancethe ruthlessness
879,00:36:55.60,00:36:55.60,required to get
880,00:36:56.97,00:36:56.97,to the final two
881,00:36:58.73,00:36:58.73,   with the likability needed to get the final vote?
882,00:37:03.47,00:37:03.47,Good question.
883,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,   I'm not even exactly sure what my strategy's going to be
884,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,as to who I'm going to vote for   from week to week.
885,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,"I'm just goingto keep getting fish,"
886,00:37:13.43,00:37:13.43,feeding people--  hope they're happy.
887,00:37:15.20,00:37:15.20,"How aboutyou, Gervase?"
888,00:37:17.93,00:37:17.93,You're wearing immunity;  tonight you're fine.
889,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,   Same thing applies to you.
890,00:37:21.70,00:37:21.70, How do you find that balance?
891,00:37:23.43,00:37:23.43,Just... I'm winging it.
892,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,"  Every day out here,  I'm just winging it."
893,00:37:27.20,00:37:27.20,"I like everybody here, you know,"
894,00:37:29.43,00:37:29.43," and after seeing their videos   of their families,"
895,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,I can put faceswith them now.
896,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,I see they have
897,00:37:34.30,00:37:34.30,"loved ones like I docaring about them,"
898,00:37:36.43,00:37:36.43,"   rooting for them,  so it makes it a lot harder."
899,00:37:39.13,00:37:39.13,"Jenna, how surprisedwere you last week"
900,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,to see Gretchenget voted off?
901,00:37:45.33,00:37:45.33, I was very surprised.
902,00:37:46.90,00:37:46.90,"  I would've thought she would have made it to the final two,"
903,00:37:50.70,00:37:50.70,"  but when we merged,strategies had to shift"
904,00:37:53.40,00:37:53.40,"and it looked like they  were getting rid of leaders,"
905,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73," so, from here on out,  if I get voted off,"
906,00:37:59.30,00:37:59.30,  I'll wear it like a badge of honor
907,00:38:01.33,00:38:01.33,when I walkdown there.
908,00:38:03.10,00:38:03.10,"  Susan, straight up, is there an alliance?"
909,00:38:05.90,00:38:05.90,"   No, not that I..."
910,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,"   I vote people off that I don't care for,"
911,00:38:13.77,00:38:13.77,"  you know, that really would  irritate me if I was"
912,00:38:16.63,00:38:16.63,   working with them at a jobor something like that.
913,00:38:19.40,00:38:19.40,"  Here, I got a chance   to vote them off."
914,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27, I can get rid of them.
915,00:38:22.60,00:38:22.60,"   It's, like, yeah!"
916,00:38:24.43,00:38:24.43,"Kelly, same question."
917,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57,  Do I have to answer?
918,00:38:28.23,00:38:28.23,   I'm just kidding.
919,00:38:29.60,00:38:29.60,Has your voting strategy changednow or will it change tonight?
920,00:38:35.43,00:38:35.43, I vote for who I don't   particularly like.
921,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,  I vote for who I don't wantto spend the next 15 days with.
922,00:38:42.60,00:38:42.60,"Colleen, would you dowhatever it takes"
923,00:38:44.70,00:38:44.70,to get this money?
924,00:38:45.90,00:38:45.90,Would you play sidesagainst each other?
925,00:38:48.23,00:38:48.23,  No.
926,00:38:49.23,00:38:49.23,Just not importantenough?
927,00:38:50.60,00:38:50.60, Right.
928,00:38:52.00,00:38:52.00, What brought you here if it's not the money?
929,00:38:54.23,00:38:54.23,"I mean, I'm here"
930,00:38:55.37,00:38:55.37,"  for the money, too."
931,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"I mean, give me a break.   Of course."
932,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03, But the thing is that
933,00:38:59.40,00:38:59.40,"everybody's here for the money,   you know?"
934,00:39:01.40,00:39:01.40,I'm not going to listen   to everybody's sob stories
935,00:39:04.30,00:39:04.30,  and then weigh them.
936,00:39:05.30,00:39:05.30,   That's ridiculous.
937,00:39:06.30,00:39:06.30,Everybody wants the money.
938,00:39:09.10,00:39:09.10,  All right. Gervase?  It's time to vote.
939,00:39:23.27,00:39:23.27, My vote is for Jenna.
940,00:39:24.57,00:39:24.57,I think she's really missingher kids now.
941,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,She didn't getthe videotape.
942,00:39:27.67,00:39:27.67,"There's not a letter for her,"
943,00:39:29.13,00:39:29.13," so, you know, I thinkit's really hurting her,"
944,00:39:31.73,00:39:31.73, so this is her ticket.
945,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,"Keeping with my strategy of alphabetical order,"
946,00:39:47.60,00:39:47.60,  I'm voting for Greg tonight.
947,00:39:49.67,00:39:49.67,"   It would have been   Gervase's turn, but he won"
948,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,"immunity, so I had to skip him."
949,00:39:53.03,00:39:53.03, Next person in order is Greg.
950,00:39:54.60,00:39:54.60,   I don't think this vote isgoing to mean very much.
951,00:40:15.83,00:40:15.83,"First time for paranoia,   second time for irritation"
952,00:40:19.23,00:40:19.23, and third time becausemy ear infection is clearing up.
953,00:40:32.57,00:40:32.57,"   ♪ Good night, sweetheart,   yeah, it's time to go. ♪"
954,00:40:37.77,00:40:37.77,No more competition.
955,00:40:39.90,00:40:39.90,"Talk to you later, Greg.Bye-bye."
956,00:40:57.47,00:40:57.47,"As always I'd like to remind youthat once the votes are tallied,"
957,00:41:00.13,00:41:00.13, the decision is final
958,00:41:01.67,00:41:01.67,  and the person will be askedto leave the island immediately.
959,00:41:04.90,00:41:04.90,I'll read the votes.

985,00:42:54.33,00:42:54.33,  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
986,00:42:56.70,00:42:56.70,  Good night.
987,00:43:18.53,00:43:18.53, Next week on Survivor:
988,00:43:21.93,00:43:21.93,I'm just being honest.
989,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,If you can't takethe honesty...
990,00:43:24.57,00:43:24.57, Cracks begin to appear    in the alliance.
991,00:43:26.67,00:43:26.67,  I'm hoping that Kelly hasn't
992,00:43:28.23,00:43:28.23, joined forces   with somebody else.
993,00:43:30.47,00:43:30.47,  Someone will win a letter    in the reward challenge.
994,00:43:33.50,00:43:33.50, Will Jenna finally hear   from her children?
995,00:43:35.53,00:43:35.53, JENNA: I want the letter from home.
996,00:43:36.90,00:43:36.90,I haven't seen or heardanything from my kids.
997,00:43:45.40,00:43:45.40,A twist of fatethat maybe somedidn't expect
