92,00:06:08.12,00:06:08.12,"though, so let's stop being negative."

174,00:11:02.75,00:11:02.75,to be doing something. I thought y'all were supposed to
175,00:11:05.04,00:11:05.04,be doing something. We need to do the roof and get
176,00:11:07.42,00:11:07.42,some fire. >> Yeah.
177,00:11:09.04,00:11:09.04,We tried and I couldn't do it. >> So y'all going to stop?

183,00:11:21.04,00:11:21.04,The only reason why stuff gets done is I don't want to sleep
184,00:11:23.62,00:11:23.62,on... get rained on. I can't do all this stuff by

192,00:11:42.08,00:11:42.08,"You're supposed to be showing us what to do, and you're down here"
193,00:11:44.08,00:11:44.08,"taking a nap."" And I'm, like, thinking he's"
194,00:11:46.08,00:11:46.08,"yelling at me at first. I looked over at him, and he's"
195,00:11:49.04,00:11:49.04,"like, ""You're just a flight attendant."
196,00:11:51.71,00:11:51.71,"I'm talking about him, our leader."""
197,00:11:53.75,00:11:53.75,"And I was like, ""Okay, let him get ripped up,"" you know?"
198,00:11:57.00,00:11:57.00,>> You have to help. You have to help me out.
199,00:11:59.25,00:11:59.25,"The rest of them, hey... you need to get your ass up."
200,00:12:01.12,00:12:01.12,Come on. There's just too much delegating
201,00:12:03.21,00:12:03.21,and a whole lot of nothing getting done.
202,00:12:05.17,00:12:05.17,"Now, I'm not going to do this by myself anymore."
203,00:12:07.04,00:12:07.04,They're going to pull the rope with me or they're all going to
204,00:12:08.88,00:12:08.88,die. I'll move in that cave.

207,00:12:21.38,00:12:21.38,>> Absolutely not. >> That's not what I've heard.
208,00:12:23.08,00:12:23.08,>> Todd. >> What?
209,00:12:24.46,00:12:24.46,">> First of all, fix your tone. >> No."
210,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,>> Fix your tone. >> No.

212,00:12:39.58,00:12:39.58,Go! ...Fei Long rolled to their
213,00:12:42.54,00:12:42.54,second straight victory... Fei Long wins!
214,00:12:45.33,00:12:45.33,...and a major element of the game was revealed.
215,00:12:48.25,00:12:48.25,"Fei Long, because you defeated Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap"
216,00:12:51.75,00:12:51.75,one member of their tribe. That person will come and live
217,00:12:56.08,00:12:56.08,with you until the next immunity challenge.
218,00:12:58.12,00:12:58.12,Who are you going to kidnap? >> Jaime.
219,00:13:03.12,00:13:03.12,>> PROBST: There's one more layer to this twist.
220,00:13:05.46,00:13:05.46,"Jaime, this is for you. It says, ""Open in private."""

222,00:13:12.96,00:13:12.96,>> Okay. >> PROBST: And if losing wasn't
223,00:13:16.12,00:13:16.12,"bad enough, Zhan Hu was hit even harder when they returned to"
224,00:13:19.17,00:13:19.17,camp. >> It looks like a natural
225,00:13:22.25,00:13:22.25,disaster hit our camp. This is basically destroyed.
226,00:13:25.79,00:13:25.79,>> It was like somebody just took all the water from every
227,00:13:30.83,00:13:30.83,ocean they could find and just poured it right on top of us.
228,00:13:33.71,00:13:33.71,>> PROBST: And they quickly devised a plan to restore their
229,00:13:36.54,00:13:36.54,"camp. >> I'm going in, I'm getting the"
230,00:13:39.71,00:13:39.71,machete and I'm cutting a channel.
231,00:13:41.67,00:13:41.67,">> Yeah, it was pretty disheartening."
232,00:13:43.62,00:13:43.62,"My first reaction was just, ""Oh, brother."
233,00:13:46.25,00:13:46.25,"Here we go, something else to worry about."""
234,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,"But, you know, when there's a problem, you can only spend so"
235,00:13:50.08,00:13:50.08,much time being worried about it.
236,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,"You really have to just, ""All right, let's fix it."""
237,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,>> If you can at least cut through some of those fibers and
238,00:13:58.50,00:13:58.50,"those roots. >> Oh, there you go, there you"
239,00:14:04.12,00:14:04.12,go! There it is.
240,00:14:06.58,00:14:06.58,">> Are they coming yet? >> Yeah, it's starting."
241,00:14:08.50,00:14:08.50,">> Great effort. We're digging channels, trying"
242,00:14:10.83,00:14:10.83,to get our different plateaus to drain.
243,00:14:12.96,00:14:12.96,"We have three plateaus here at our camp, and the top one's"
244,00:14:15.08,00:14:15.08,"draining into our living one, which is draining into our"
245,00:14:18.58,00:14:18.58,"bamboo prep fields, which is then tumbling two meters down"
246,00:14:23.21,00:14:23.21,"into the lake. >> Hopefully, we'll be able to"
247,00:14:33.96,00:14:33.96,get this really dry and finally have a comfortable camp that's
248,00:14:36.29,00:14:36.29,"not wet and muddy, so... The water is actually starting"
249,00:14:38.50,00:14:38.50,"to flow now, so I think it's actually working."
250,00:14:42.17,00:14:42.17,">> PROBST: That same day at Fei Long, Jaime found a quiet place"
251,00:14:46.00,00:14:46.00,"to open the bamboo tube. >> ""In this sealed tube is a"
252,00:14:50.25,00:14:50.25,clue to a hidden immunity idol at the enemy camp.

254,00:14:56.50,00:14:56.50,"My strategy, as far as the clue goes, is I'm going to give it to"
255,00:14:59.04,00:14:59.04,whom I think it is their weakest link.
256,00:15:02.12,00:15:02.12,">> PROBST: In an attempt to be strategic, Jaime gave the clue"
257,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,to Leslie. Don't let anybody know you have
258,00:15:07.04,00:15:07.04,it. >> Okay.
259,00:15:08.79,00:15:08.79,I feel like the Lord really gave me a gift.
260,00:15:11.25,00:15:11.25,">> PROBST: Leslie formed an alliance of her own, hoping it"
261,00:15:14.33,00:15:14.33,"would help keep her in the game. >> I told Todd the idol is here,"
262,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,so we're going to team up and use it together.
263,00:15:22.21,00:15:22.21,And I trust him. >> I can't believe she told me.
264,00:15:25.75,00:15:25.75,I'm in shock! I would never tell anybody.
265,00:15:28.29,00:15:28.29,"What was she thinking? >> PROBST: The next morning,"
266,00:15:36.08,00:15:36.08,Aaron woke everyone up and delivered some surprising news.
267,00:15:43.17,00:15:43.17,">> All right, so, making an announcement."
268,00:15:46.46,00:15:46.46,"It's been real, and it's been fun, but it hasn't been real"
269,00:15:49.12,00:15:49.12,fun. >> I just can't stand all the
270,00:15:51.38,00:15:51.38,Brady Bunch antics that go on in this tribe.
271,00:15:54.17,00:15:54.17,"Aaron stood up this morning, put on his little suit and jacket"
272,00:15:56.25,00:15:56.25,"with his little powwow. Like, some of us haven't even"
273,00:16:01.04,00:16:01.04,taken our heads off the bamboo yet.
274,00:16:03.08,00:16:03.08,>> I am now relinquishing my title as leader.
275,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,"I can't continue to, like, keep tabs on everyone else, and I"
276,00:16:10.04,00:16:10.04,don't want to keep tabs on everyone else.
277,00:16:12.08,00:16:12.08,"But I've definitely enjoyed, you know, helping out, you know,"
278,00:16:14.21,00:16:14.21,"with whatever advice I can give, but I'm tired of making"
279,00:16:17.21,00:16:17.21,decisions. >> Aaron came up with this new
280,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,"brilliant idea-- ""I'm relinquishing my leadership"
281,00:16:23.08,00:16:23.08,"position."" What?"
282,00:16:26.08,00:16:26.08,">> All right, let's get some fire."
283,00:16:28.00,00:16:28.00,"so Amanda is on stairs. Jean-Robert, you're going to do"
284,00:16:30.58,00:16:30.58,logs with James later in the day.
285,00:16:33.00,00:16:33.00,"So does anyone know how to fish? >> ""No, I'm not the leader,"" and"
286,00:16:37.17,00:16:37.17,"right afterwards, he told us all what to do."
287,00:16:45.88,00:16:45.88,">> PROBST: Over at Zhan Hu, Dave's lack of sleep was"
288,00:16:47.79,00:16:47.79,starting to affect him. >> I'm up first primarily
289,00:16:53.58,00:16:53.58,because I got shuffled and squeezed out of every
290,00:16:57.29,00:16:57.29,comfortable sleeping position there is.
291,00:17:00.96,00:17:00.96,"And if no one can see I'm the tallest person around here,"
292,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,that's starting to get under my skin a little bit.
293,00:17:07.29,00:17:07.29,Hello. You know?
294,00:17:11.67,00:17:11.67,>> PROBST: And Dave expressed his views about eating before a
295,00:17:15.96,00:17:15.96,challenge. >> We decided to do rice and
296,00:17:17.75,00:17:17.75,just a little bit so it will boil faster.
297,00:17:19.29,00:17:19.29,We don't know how much time we have to go before our challenge.
298,00:17:21.42,00:17:21.42,">> I'll tell you, man, eating the rice right before a"
299,00:17:24.33,00:17:24.33,"challenge, I don't know. I know that digestion diverts"
300,00:17:26.96,00:17:26.96,all your energy to your stomach. >> But we're all starving.
301,00:17:30.29,00:17:30.29,">> I'm... I'm... watch this. Please, patience."
302,00:17:37.96,00:17:37.96,">> You're so dramatic. >> Well, you know, I mentioned"
303,00:17:40.29,00:17:40.29,this so many times. And I have reasons for it.
304,00:17:43.88,00:17:43.88,>> I think it's better to eat when you're starving before you
305,00:17:45.79,00:17:45.79,"have to exert energy. >> My physiology, my metabolism"
306,00:17:48.04,00:17:48.04,is not yours. Whatever you guys need to feel
307,00:17:50.54,00:17:50.54,"better about it, if you feel better after a meal, then by all"
308,00:17:52.79,00:17:52.79,"means, cook the rice. >> If you don't want to eat,"
309,00:17:55.96,00:17:55.96,"that's... Well, I don't think any of us"
310,00:17:59.25,00:17:59.25,need to eat right now. I just think it's smart to.
311,00:18:03.62,00:18:03.62,>> You guys know your bodies. You guys start yourselves up.
312,00:18:05.46,00:18:05.46,"I am not going to tell you what to do, what not to do in that"
313,00:18:07.21,00:18:07.21,respect. >> Dave hasn't been eating.
314,00:18:09.58,00:18:09.58,He hasn't wanted to because he says his energy is high.
315,00:18:12.25,00:18:12.25,He keeps telling everybody that he somehow gets magical energy
316,00:18:14.50,00:18:14.50,from the air and he doesn't need to eat.
317,00:18:18.12,00:18:18.12,I think he'd be smarter than that.
318,00:18:20.42,00:18:20.42,>> Good things come to those who wait.
319,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,I don't like doing things half- assed.
320,00:18:24.62,00:18:24.62,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Dave ate his words,"
321,00:18:29.12,00:18:29.12,causing Zhan Hu to lose. Fei Long wins immunity!
322,00:18:32.58,00:18:32.58,"When Zhan Hu returned to camp, Dave knew he was in the hot"
323,00:18:37.04,00:18:37.04,seat. >> I apologize.
324,00:18:39.67,00:18:39.67,I feel like I let us down today. >> Start the fire.
325,00:18:42.38,00:18:42.38,>> Let me finish. >> In the fireplace.
326,00:18:44.29,00:18:44.29,>> Let me finish. >> PROBST: And his constant
327,00:18:46.38,00:18:46.38,"bickering with Ashley... >> You're the leader, and I'm"
328,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,going to let you do what you want.
329,00:18:50.17,00:18:50.17,">> How many fires have you built, sweetheart?"
330,00:18:51.62,00:18:51.62,>> PROBST: ...put them both in jeopardy.
331,00:18:53.46,00:18:53.46,"At tribal council, Ashley ended up getting the boot."
332,00:18:56.04,00:18:56.04,"Ashley, the tribe has spoken. The next morning at Fei Long,"
333,00:19:03.71,00:19:03.71,"Leslie cleaned up around camp. >> Oh, they were?"
334,00:19:31.21,00:19:31.21,"Okay. >> This morning, I woke up, and"
335,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,I caught Leslie throwing away our bait.
336,00:19:45.08,00:19:45.08,We caught it yesterday. We needed that today to catch
337,00:19:47.29,00:19:47.29,the crabs and the fish. And she thought there were too
338,00:19:49.88,00:19:49.88,"many flies on it, so she threw all our food away."
339,00:19:52.21,00:19:52.21,I was in shock. I cannot believe how silly some
340,00:19:56.12,00:19:56.12,people can be. >> Huh?
341,00:20:03.58,00:20:03.58,Huh? Yeah.
342,00:20:06.04,00:20:06.04,">> And I'm really sorry, I threw out those fish."
343,00:20:08.25,00:20:08.25,I didn't realize we were going to use them for bait.
344,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,">> And tried to find them, and I couldn't."
345,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,Here's what I'm going to do. I know.
346,00:20:14.21,00:20:14.21,I have a learning curve. I know.
347,00:20:17.00,00:20:17.00,You can yell at me. You can scream at me.
348,00:20:19.42,00:20:19.42,I'm going to go down and try to catch some more with the little
349,00:20:21.58,00:20:21.58,"net, okay? >> Uh-huh."
350,00:20:24.04,00:20:24.04,"She wakes me up this morning and tells me, ""Oh, yeah, you need to"
351,00:20:27.04,00:20:27.04,"go fishing. I'm like, ""Cool, whatever."""
352,00:20:29.21,00:20:29.21,"""Oh, but I threw out the bait."" I don't understand that!"
353,00:20:32.54,00:20:32.54,"I mean, that's amazing. I really would love to see how"
354,00:20:37.08,00:20:37.08,these people would be without me being here.
355,00:20:39.38,00:20:39.38,"It would be hilarious, because they honestly would be dead."
356,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,"They'd be in the little boat swimming, and would die of"
357,00:20:46.42,00:20:46.42,thirst and hunger and just die and float off in the river.
358,00:20:51.12,00:20:51.12,>> PROBST: At the next immunity challenge....
359,00:20:57.38,00:20:57.38,>> Get that off my finger! >> PROBST: Todd struggled with
360,00:20:59.42,00:20:59.42,the puzzle. >> Move it from my face!
361,00:21:01.67,00:21:01.67,>> PROBST: Zhan Hu wins immunity!
362,00:21:08.25,00:21:08.25,"With Fei Long facing their first tribal council, Jean-Robert"
363,00:21:11.71,00:21:11.71,started placing blame on others. >> What's on your mind regarding
364,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,today's challenge? >> It's a strategy thing and we
365,00:21:17.21,00:21:17.21,messed it up. It's that simple.
366,00:21:19.46,00:21:19.46,">> You know, you guys said we're all promoting Todd to put the"
367,00:21:22.92,00:21:22.92,"things in, so I didn't want to get in his way, but I handed"
368,00:21:25.25,00:21:25.25,them all in the right places. It was a matter of going up or
369,00:21:27.29,00:21:27.29,"down. You know, it wasn't that"
370,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,complicated a puzzle. >> Did you... did you realize
371,00:21:31.50,00:21:31.50,this and then... >> I let Todd take the charge
372,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,"and he was doing it, and it looked like he was doing just"
373,00:21:36.62,00:21:36.62,fine for a while. >> Now Jean-Robert is spinning
374,00:21:39.08,00:21:39.08,"it that Todd didn't do the puzzle right, so it's always"

571,00:32:15.96,00:32:15.96,"and I'd have no idea. It's a weird symbol, so I don't"
572,00:32:18.33,00:32:18.33,know what it stands for. >> PROBST: James had to laugh
573,00:32:22.88,00:32:22.88,when he noticed the plaque was gone.
574,00:32:25.08,00:32:25.08,>> The thought of this woman having a blank one...

580,00:32:46.04,00:32:46.04,"was away from camp, Jaime decided to do some snooping."
581,00:32:52.96,00:32:52.96,"But in the dark, she was unable to differentiate James's idols"
582,00:32:55.75,00:32:55.75,from her own. On day 20...
583,00:33:01.71,00:33:01.71,Drop your buffs. ...the tribes merged.

598,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,"I don't know what was in it, but it was really strong."
599,00:34:03.08,00:34:03.08,You could feel it in burning in your mouth a few seconds after.
600,00:34:05.04,00:34:05.04,>> This is like Survivor: the Musical.
601,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,>> \xe2\x99\xaa We live in the jungle in a tree house

605,00:34:26.71,00:34:26.71,>> They sing when they're sober. They'll sing all day and all
606,00:34:29.38,00:34:29.38,night. It's like a little musical over
607,00:34:31.17,00:34:31.17,here. I knew the alcohol would only
608,00:34:33.08,00:34:33.08,heighten it. >> What?
609,00:34:42.67,00:34:42.67,">> Oh, my God! >> The guys broke out the wine,"
610,00:35:01.88,00:35:01.88,and they've been sucking it down the last couple hours and a
611,00:35:04.29,00:35:04.29,couple of them are pretty tipsy right now.
612,00:35:06.54,00:35:06.54,I'm a little older than the rest of the kids.
613,00:35:08.83,00:35:08.83,I don't want to be having a hangover.
614,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,But I think definitely Todd and definitely Amanda aren't going
615,00:35:13.04,00:35:13.04,to be feeling too well in the morning.
616,00:35:19.00,00:35:19.00,">> PROBST: On day 21, Jaime felt secure with her place in the"

619,00:35:25.67,00:35:25.67,floored. I think it's probably going to
620,00:35:27.58,00:35:27.58,"shock everyone, including Jeff. I'm not as dumb as I look, and"
621,00:35:29.88,00:35:29.88,"maybe they're figuring it out. >> PROBST: At tribal council,"
622,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,Jaime played what she thought was an immunity idol.
623,00:35:37.08,00:35:37.08,>> I found this at camp lying on the floor.
624,00:35:39.83,00:35:39.83,So I thought it might be immunity.
625,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,>> PROBST: This is not a hidden immunity idol.
626,00:35:47.46,00:35:47.46,But her hopes were tossed aside. Seventh person voted out of
627,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,"Survivor: China, and the first member of our jury, Jaime."
628,00:35:54.75,00:35:54.75,"Jaime, the tribe has spoken. And Jaime became the first"
629,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,"member of the jury. Up next, Peih-Gee tries to make"
630,00:36:03.04,00:36:03.04,amends. >> You can accept it or not.
631,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,>> No. >> But I really am sorry.
632,00:36:10.71,00:36:10.71,">> You're really not. Please, stop messing with me and"
633,00:36:12.25,00:36:12.25,go sit down somewhere else. >> PROBST: On the morning of day
634,00:36:23.21,00:36:23.21,"23, James took some time alone to clear his thoughts."
635,00:36:27.25,00:36:27.25,>> They're a bunch of late sleepers over here.
636,00:36:30.62,00:36:30.62,They're just so tired. You've got to motivate yourself.
637,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33,I'm a grave digger. I've been doing it my whole
638,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,life. My dad handed me a shovel
639,00:36:39.88,00:36:39.88,at 11 and told me to start working.
640,00:36:42.88,00:36:42.88,And that's all I've ever done. All I do is work.
641,00:36:45.79,00:36:45.79,I'm used to being in the hot sun with a shovel in my hand.
642,00:36:48.38,00:36:48.38,"And over here, there's nothing for me to do but, you know,"
643,00:36:51.21,00:36:51.21,provide. I like cooking.
644,00:36:54.50,00:36:54.50,I like catching fish. I love providing for people.
645,00:36:57.25,00:36:57.25,"I mean, that's what I do. It's one of the reasons I'm"
646,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,"still here. I mean, granted, the two idols I"
647,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"do have are a big part of it, but I make life easy over here."
648,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,I am that guy who's been kind of the glue of the alliance.
649,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,I feel like I am the one who is holding everybody together.
650,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,It's just right there. It's so simple.
651,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,"All we have to do is stick together, and we'll be there."
652,00:37:21.50,00:37:21.50,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Courtney was the last"
653,00:37:25.12,00:37:25.12,one sitting. Courtney wins immunity!
654,00:37:28.46,00:37:28.46,"Facing tribal council, Erik filled Jean-Robert in on the"
655,00:37:31.71,00:37:31.71,secret behind the immunity idols.
656,00:37:34.08,00:37:34.08,>> We looked in James' bag and there were two of them.
657,00:37:36.29,00:37:36.29,>> Wow. This is the guy favored to win
658,00:37:38.54,00:37:38.54,every challenge from here out. >> PROBST: So Jean-Robert
659,00:37:40.92,00:37:40.92,confronted James. >> You have two immunity idols?
660,00:37:43.04,00:37:43.04,Two of them and you can't tell your boy?
661,00:37:45.96,00:37:45.96,"Nobody told me, bro. ...is the realization that"
662,00:37:51.83,00:37:51.83,you're holding out on me. That's what I came up with.
663,00:37:57.96,00:37:57.96,>> PROBST: Jean-Robert came up with a plan to take out his
664,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,"closest ally. We could blindside him tonight,"
665,00:38:04.25,00:38:04.25,because he will not pull out the idol tonight.
666,00:38:06.79,00:38:06.79,>> Let's see how it goes tonight.
667,00:38:08.58,00:38:08.58,I was kind of bothered by the fact he's coming up with all
668,00:38:11.29,00:38:11.29,these ideas that I've had for days now.
669,00:38:13.58,00:38:13.58,>> PROBST: But Todd turned the tables on Jean-Robert.
670,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,>> I think our best bet is... >> I don't want to break the
671,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,"system, but... >> Do we want to tell Denise or"
672,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,no? >> No-- hell no!
673,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,">> PROBST: But at tribal council, James took the risk of"
674,00:38:25.50,00:38:25.50,not using one of his idols... James.
675,00:38:28.50,00:38:28.50,...and almost paid the price. James received three votes.
676,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"One vote left. But in the end, Jean-Robert with"
677,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,five votes was dealt a losing hand.
678,00:38:37.00,00:38:37.00,"Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken."
679,00:38:45.46,00:38:45.46,"At the reward challenge, Peih- Gee was captain of the red team,"
680,00:38:50.17,00:38:50.17,Erik captain of the yellow. Go.
681,00:38:53.71,00:38:53.71,Peih-Gee's team dropped the ball.
682,00:38:56.79,00:38:56.79,"James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't get it."
683,00:38:59.50,00:38:59.50,And Erik's team bounced to victory.
684,00:39:01.58,00:39:01.58,"Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and Courtney, cruising down the"
685,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,"river. >> All right, everyone, cheers"
686,00:39:06.75,00:39:06.75,"to us. >> PROBST: During the cruise,"
687,00:39:08.75,00:39:08.75,Courtney grew closer to Frosti. >> I love my Frosti.
688,00:39:13.54,00:39:13.54,"I love my Frosti. >> PROBST: Back at camp,"
689,00:39:15.96,00:39:15.96,Peih-Gee blamed James for losing the challenge.
690,00:39:26.71,00:39:26.71,That's why y'all lose. You're quick to blame.
691,00:39:29.00,00:39:29.00,>> Mm-hmm. >> I can finish?
692,00:39:31.25,00:39:31.25,"Can I please finish? >> No, you can't, because I"
693,00:39:33.04,00:39:33.04,"don't care. >> You know, I need to take a"
694,00:39:34.83,00:39:34.83,"walk right now. >> Peih-Gee, she's just stupid."

696,00:39:51.17,00:39:51.17,">> No, you're not. Don't politic."
697,00:39:53.25,00:39:53.25,>> I'm not politicking. I'm apologizing.
698,00:39:55.08,00:39:55.08,"So you can accept it or you're not, but I really am sorry,"
699,00:39:57.21,00:39:57.21,"okay? >> No, you're not."
700,00:39:58.75,00:39:58.75,You're really not. >> Please stop messing with me
701,00:40:00.29,00:40:00.29,"and go sit down somewhere else. >> No, I came up to apologize."
702,00:40:02.29,00:40:02.29,"I didn't come out to fight with you some more, okay?"
703,00:40:04.12,00:40:04.12,">> Well, obviously, you did. >> You know what?"
704,00:40:06.33,00:40:06.33,"Listen, that's cool. You're not in the mood to accept"
705,00:40:09.00,00:40:09.00,"my apology, that's fine. I can understand that."
706,00:40:11.25,00:40:11.25,">> I know what kind of person You are, and this is just a"

712,00:40:26.62,00:40:26.62,"I'm in, like, a really bad position."
