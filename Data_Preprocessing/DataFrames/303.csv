34,00:03:01.30,00:03:01.30,"We went into this thing knowing,yeah, it's going to be tough,"
35,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,"it's going to be real, but Idon't think any of us really"
36,00:03:05.07,00:03:05.07,considered that it was going tobe quite that real.
37,00:03:12.00,00:03:12.00,"- It's the worst feeling in theworld, like, getting startled"
38,00:03:15.30,00:03:15.30,out of your sleep by a roar.
39,00:03:20.33,00:03:20.33,"- My mind said stay,but my feet said go."

48,00:03:49.07,00:03:49.07,"pacing, but, as it turns out,there were two lions."
49,00:03:57.63,00:03:57.63,"If you're approached by ananimal, you don't run and"
50,00:04:00.20,00:04:00.20,hopefully everythingwill work out.
51,00:04:01.90,00:04:01.90,You're notgoing to beat a beast.
52,00:04:03.47,00:04:03.47,(roaring)
53,00:04:04.87,00:04:04.87,- That was real.

59,00:04:34.60,00:04:34.60,- Morning.
60,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,- Why do we get up so early?
61,00:04:40.03,00:04:40.03,- I don't know.
62,00:04:42.53,00:04:42.53,Because everyone else does.
63,00:04:44.13,00:04:44.13,"- First thing in the morning,the four of us like to sleep a"
64,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,little bit later and the fourolder people get up a little bit
65,00:04:48.93,00:04:48.93,"before us, and so they decidedthis morning that they wanted to"
66,00:04:51.43,00:04:51.43,go get water before any of uswere even up or had shoes on or
67,00:04:53.93,00:04:53.93,"whatever so, they took off."
68,00:04:55.13,00:04:55.13,- We're going downto the water.
69,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,Does anybody want to come?

71,00:04:59.40,00:04:59.40,- I so don't want to go downthere right now.
72,00:05:02.17,00:05:02.17,"- Of course I went to get thewater, because if I don't get"
73,00:05:03.77,00:05:03.77,"up, it's notgoing to get done."
74,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,You think anybody else gets offtheir ass to do anything?
75,00:05:07.07,00:05:07.07,"I'm starting to wonder here,I'm like, look, I'm the old guy,"
76,00:05:10.20,00:05:10.20,"okay, but I know what needs tobe done-- every morning, fire,"
77,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,water and food.

79,00:05:16.20,00:05:16.20,but youwant to swap off?
80,00:05:17.40,00:05:17.40,- I'll do breakfast.
81,00:05:18.90,00:05:18.90,"- You do breakfast, I'll dowater this morning?"
82,00:05:20.70,00:05:20.70,- That's cool.
83,00:05:20.70,00:05:20.70,- Are you sure?
84,00:05:21.90,00:05:21.90,- I have noproblem with that.
85,00:05:23.07,00:05:23.07,- Because I was going to dobreakfast.
86,00:05:24.20,00:05:24.20,"- No, don'tworry about it."
87,00:05:25.50,00:05:25.50,"- We got all the gourds,they got the knife."
88,00:05:26.67,00:05:26.67,"You want yourcanteen, babe?"
89,00:05:28.13,00:05:28.13,"- Yeah,I'll take it with."

91,00:05:32.47,00:05:32.47,"Basically, we kind of feel likethey're sucking up to us a"
92,00:05:35.37,00:05:35.37,"little bit, so, yeah, I mean, ifthey'll go get the water and we"
93,00:05:39.53,00:05:39.53,"don't need to help, why not?"
94,00:05:40.63,00:05:40.63,We want to saveour strength.
95,00:05:42.10,00:05:42.10,"- Y'all, don't ever forget whatthey've been putting us through"
96,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,the last six days.
97,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"They are conniving, miserablelittle people, that were walking"
98,00:05:49.07,00:05:49.07,around talking about us.
99,00:05:50.33,00:05:50.33,So don't forgetfor one second...
100,00:05:51.73,00:05:51.73,- They're talking about itright now.
101,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,- They are talkingabout it right now.
102,00:05:56.37,00:05:56.37,- Remember when Silas said whathe thought would be a good idea
103,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,was if the fourof us voted one way?
104,00:06:02.13,00:06:02.13,- Right.
105,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,- And then he would get them tosplit their votes?
106,00:06:05.60,00:06:05.60,- Right.
107,00:06:07.07,00:06:07.07,"- I think that's what he's gotin mind, so he doesn't come out"
108,00:06:09.97,00:06:09.97,being the bad guy.
109,00:06:11.40,00:06:11.40,"- T-bird, he should have atleast said to you, you know,"
110,00:06:14.80,00:06:14.80,"even me, ""Look, this iswhat I'm doing."
111,00:06:17.17,00:06:17.17,"This is my strategy."""
112,00:06:18.23,00:06:18.23,We'll see.
113,00:06:19.50,00:06:19.50,- We're just wondering if Silasis still with us or not.
114,00:06:22.00,00:06:22.00,"My gut feeling just says he'splaying, playing both sides."
115,00:06:26.13,00:06:26.13,But I'm not--I can't be for sure.
116,00:06:29.00,00:06:29.00,"- Don't go home with brokenspirits,"
117,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,I was justsaying that to T.
118,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,- My spirit is not broken.
119,00:06:34.30,00:06:34.30,- Because this place can justfill our spirits so much.
120,00:06:38.87,00:06:38.87,"There's so much to be taken awayfrom here, and just, you know,"
121,00:06:42.20,00:06:42.20,"try not to let people get toyou, because that's what they"
122,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,want to do.
123,00:06:51.50,00:06:51.50,- I like to cookbecause I like
124,00:06:53.27,00:06:53.27,"my gruel, like,fried a certain way."
125,00:06:56.10,00:06:56.10,"Plus, if I'm cooking, then my..."
126,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17,"team, my friendsget a little"
127,00:07:01.73,00:07:01.73,bit bigger portionsand they get more.
128,00:07:04.97,00:07:04.97,We're going to act like thesecrispies are all we're having.
129,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,We didn't have mush.
130,00:07:08.40,00:07:08.40,We don't want themto think we ate their...
131,00:07:10.37,00:07:10.37,You know what I mean?
132,00:07:10.37,00:07:10.37,- Sure.
133,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,"- When Brandon was cooking, hesaid that we should have first"
134,00:07:15.43,00:07:15.43,dibs and we should pig out andeat as much as we can and leave
135,00:07:19.20,00:07:19.20,them whatever is left.
136,00:07:21.13,00:07:21.13,"I mean, if theywant more,"
137,00:07:22.37,00:07:22.37,"they can make more,you know, that's fine."
138,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,- Ouch!
139,00:07:27.27,00:07:27.27,- Excellent.
140,00:07:36.83,00:07:36.83,- Did we not leave themany food?
141,00:07:39.63,00:07:39.63,"- I'm boiling some water, I'mboiling some water, so they can"
142,00:07:42.77,00:07:42.77,make it when they come back.
143,00:07:43.90,00:07:43.90,- Can I have that one?
144,00:07:45.57,00:07:45.57,- Is that them?
145,00:07:47.70,00:07:47.70,"- Your breakfast is burnt,probably."
146,00:07:50.53,00:07:50.53,We left it onthe fire... Kim did.
147,00:08:08.53,00:08:08.53,- That sucked last night.
148,00:08:11.60,00:08:11.60,"- Oh, my gosh."
149,00:08:14.40,00:08:14.40,Big cat.
150,00:08:15.80,00:08:15.80,"- That, right there,is, like..."
151,00:08:18.67,00:08:18.67,"I mean, that's how big it is,that's how big the paw print is."
152,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,- The lions are probably right
153,00:08:23.30,00:08:23.30,"over there, sleeping inthe grass, watching us."
154,00:08:25.07,00:08:25.07,"- Oh, yeah, they're sleeping,I think, during the day."
155,00:08:26.73,00:08:26.73,"- We know thatthey're around,"
156,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,and we know thatthey're really close.
157,00:08:28.87,00:08:28.87,- And they're not scared of us.
158,00:08:30.37,00:08:30.37,"- And, you know, would onlylead us to believe-- don't you"
159,00:08:32.27,00:08:32.27,think-- that they would comearound more and more and more?
160,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47,"- If we happen to be out and wesee a lion during the day,"
161,00:08:36.97,00:08:36.97,we need to standabsolutely still.
162,00:08:39.40,00:08:39.40,"I mean, as soon as you run away,you immediately throw a signal"
163,00:08:42.87,00:08:42.87,"that you're prey, andthat's just inviting the lion to"
164,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,just jump on youand maul you.
165,00:08:52.87,00:08:52.87,- We've got tofix that fence.
166,00:08:58.40,00:08:58.40,"- We've got some weak spots,little holes there, you know,"
167,00:09:01.50,00:09:01.50,they can slideunder right down here.
168,00:09:03.87,00:09:03.87,So we're just trying to beefthings up a bit.
169,00:09:25.60,00:09:25.60,"- Oh, my beads."
170,00:09:27.07,00:09:27.07,- The biggest problem we have
171,00:09:28.57,00:09:28.57,is we have two cracks in thewater tubs.
172,00:09:30.70,00:09:30.70,They're putting ondamn beads on a necklace.
173,00:09:33.00,00:09:33.00,Generation X.
174,00:09:34.47,00:09:34.47,"Like a putty sealer, huh?"
175,00:09:35.93,00:09:35.93,- Maybe it'll do the trick.
176,00:09:37.63,00:09:37.63,- Does the crack looklike it's gone?
177,00:09:39.90,00:09:39.90,No?
178,00:09:42.47,00:09:42.47,I just can'tsit around and not
179,00:09:44.70,00:09:44.70,"attempt something, you knowwhat I mean?"
180,00:09:46.33,00:09:46.33,- One of my best friends mademe a necklace and each bead is
181,00:09:49.30,00:09:49.30,"someone who's close to me, andmy necklace broke, so Kim and I"
182,00:09:52.20,00:09:52.20,were sitting aroundtrying to fix it.
183,00:09:53.83,00:09:53.83,"And I said, ""Well, now thatwe're a foursome, I think"
184,00:09:57.30,00:09:57.30,"each of you needto have a bead on my necklace,"""
185,00:09:59.53,00:09:59.53,"so I said, ""Hey,there's an idea."
186,00:10:01.33,00:10:01.33,I'll give you each your bead andwe'll have these necklaces that
187,00:10:04.00,00:10:04.00,"represent thatwe're one unit,"
188,00:10:05.27,00:10:05.27,"like little kids infifth grade."""
189,00:10:09.23,00:10:09.23,- How does it look?
190,00:10:10.63,00:10:10.63,- Give me your finger.
191,00:10:11.80,00:10:11.80,- Does it look nice?
192,00:10:13.10,00:10:13.10,- Stick yourthumb back here.
193,00:10:14.40,00:10:14.40,"- Lindsey, making beadnecklaces,"
194,00:10:16.73,00:10:16.73,that's a waste of time.
195,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,"Food, shelter, water."
196,00:10:20.30,00:10:20.30,"All efforts should beconcentrated on that,"
197,00:10:22.63,00:10:22.63,"not here making beads, you know,not sun tanning yourself,"
198,00:10:25.97,00:10:25.97,all that is nonsense.
199,00:10:28.17,00:10:28.17,- How's that feel?
200,00:10:29.30,00:10:29.30,- Awesome.

410,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,- Samburu!
411,00:19:08.00,00:19:08.00,- Samburu!
412,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13,- Yeah!
413,00:19:14.27,00:19:14.27,"- (Probst) Boran, you got yourfirst taste of victory--"
414,00:19:17.27,00:19:17.27,along with it comes100 gallons of fresh water.
415,00:19:20.20,00:19:20.20,You'll have the water in yourcamp by tomorrow morning.
416,00:19:31.53,00:19:31.53,♪♪
417,00:19:39.73,00:19:39.73,- Everything around hererevolves around water.
418,00:19:42.67,00:19:42.67,"The key to survival out here,now it's here."
419,00:19:46.37,00:19:46.37,- That is so great.
420,00:19:49.50,00:19:49.50,- How beautifulis this.
421,00:19:51.03,00:19:51.03,- It's great.
422,00:19:53.47,00:19:53.47,"- Another thing we don't haveto worry about,"
423,00:19:55.73,00:19:55.73,getting water today.
424,00:19:57.33,00:19:57.33,- This is so nice.
425,00:20:37.27,00:20:37.27,- Good Lord.
426,00:20:38.83,00:20:38.83,- That just came out ofnowhere.
427,00:20:40.47,00:20:40.47,"- Out of nowhere, right."
428,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67,- What the hell just happened?
429,00:20:43.27,00:20:43.27,"- I know, I'm like afraid toget out from under these nets,"
430,00:20:44.93,00:20:44.93,I'm sure there are bugsall in that.
431,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"- Hey, little guy."
432,00:20:53.80,00:20:53.80,Ow.
433,00:20:55.47,00:20:55.47,"Oh, a little basket."
434,00:20:55.47,00:20:55.47,- Uh-oh.
435,00:20:57.27,00:20:57.27,- We have mail!
436,00:20:58.30,00:20:58.30,"- Hit me, girls."
437,00:20:59.37,00:20:59.37,"- Read it to us, baby."
438,00:21:00.87,00:21:00.87,"- ""Now you're lost in the wild,and there's no one around."
439,00:21:04.43,00:21:04.43,"""You might find yourselfthinking you'll never be found."
440,00:21:07.93,00:21:07.93,"""Muster all your resources,and don't stop to gloat."

444,00:21:25.40,00:21:25.40,"- Well, we got our mail thismorning, and it was a very"
445,00:21:28.20,00:21:28.20,"unique, very differentchallenge."
446,00:21:29.87,00:21:29.87,"We found out that we had to makeup some type of distress signal,"
447,00:21:32.57,00:21:32.57,so that planes flying overheadwould be able to come and see
448,00:21:36.00,00:21:36.00,"us, and it was going to be acompetition between us and the"
449,00:21:38.33,00:21:38.33,"other tribe, and whose distresssignal was the better one."
450,00:21:40.67,00:21:40.67,"- We have a perfect ""O""with thorn bushes."
451,00:21:43.53,00:21:43.53,"- Let's use ourmanyattas for the ""O."""
452,00:21:46.50,00:21:46.50,"To get a visual, you need"
453,00:21:47.80,00:21:47.80,"something light,something that hits them."
454,00:21:49.93,00:21:49.93,"So, yeah, let's do our S.O.S.like we're doing."
455,00:21:53.03,00:21:53.03,And then takeall of our manmade
456,00:21:55.20,00:21:55.20,"supplies, accentuate it, they'regoing to see that thing."
457,00:22:01.40,00:22:01.40,- So you guys want to give upon the idea of using the...
458,00:22:04.30,00:22:04.30,"- Just hang on a second,"
459,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,"you're going to make two hugeS's here, on each side."
460,00:22:08.27,00:22:08.27,- They don't have to be likemanyattas though.
461,00:22:10.67,00:22:10.67,"From the air, you can'ttell that it's raised."
462,00:22:12.23,00:22:12.23,"- That's right,but is it going"
463,00:22:13.57,00:22:13.57,to be hereand on the other side?
464,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,- Yeah.
465,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,- Let's make it happen.
466,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,(whistling)
467,00:22:17.47,00:22:17.47,- Okay.
468,00:22:18.93,00:22:18.93,"- Frankly, the four of us wouldlike to possibly see an older"
469,00:22:21.27,00:22:21.27,person have a little weak momentin the competition so they can
470,00:22:24.33,00:22:24.33,"all open their eyes, becausethey keep coming down saying"
471,00:22:26.90,00:22:26.90,the weak people need to go.
472,00:22:28.23,00:22:28.23,Just stick with me and we'llweed the weak ones out.
473,00:22:30.27,00:22:30.27,"- Hey, guys?Let's come together right now."
474,00:22:32.30,00:22:32.30,Everybody work on itright now.
475,00:22:34.83,00:22:34.83,"- You'd have to be a damn foolobviously, for me to go 110% out"
476,00:22:38.20,00:22:38.20,"there, drain my body of allenergy that I have for a bunch"
477,00:22:41.63,00:22:41.63,of kids that aren't going toappreciate it.
478,00:22:43.90,00:22:43.90,"No, I just said,I'll contribute"
479,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,"and keep moving along,make it look good."
480,00:22:48.07,00:22:48.07,"Remember the heat,Linda, take a break,"
481,00:22:49.67,00:22:49.67,take a little sip of water.
482,00:22:51.63,00:22:51.63,Don't overexert yourself.
483,00:22:53.43,00:22:53.43,(groaning)
484,00:23:05.00,00:23:05.00,- Thank you.
485,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,- You guys can lift me up in
486,00:23:11.17,00:23:11.17,the air and I'll wave the hornslike an airplane.
487,00:23:13.50,00:23:13.50,- You need something withbright colors that's going to
488,00:23:15.70,00:23:15.70,attract somebodyfrom a distance.
489,00:23:17.13,00:23:17.13,"- The first thingI think you see,"
490,00:23:18.37,00:23:18.37,"rather than movement,would even be color."
491,00:23:19.87,00:23:19.87,"- We got to find a place,probably."
492,00:23:21.93,00:23:21.93,There's no grass or nothingright out there.
493,00:23:23.87,00:23:23.87,- Let's starttaking stuff outside.
494,00:23:25.60,00:23:25.60,Let's grab all the mosquito netsand all the torches and stuff.
495,00:23:32.77,00:23:32.77,- Today's immunity challenge
496,00:23:34.27,00:23:34.27,"means absolutely everythingto us, it's huge."
497,00:23:36.60,00:23:36.60,"We definitely need to win,so we're not another man down."
498,00:23:39.77,00:23:39.77,We can't affordto go down to
499,00:23:40.93,00:23:40.93,five and lose threeof them in a row.
500,00:23:42.63,00:23:42.63,That's justunthinkable at this point.
501,00:23:44.40,00:23:44.40,"- I'll dipped this in a paint,I don't care."
502,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,- That's a good idea.
503,00:23:47.43,00:23:47.43,- You think red is the color?
504,00:23:48.83,00:23:48.83,- I had brought some acrylicpaints with me as my luxury item
505,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,and suddenly got the idea totake these mosquito nets and
506,00:23:56.00,00:23:56.00,make them a bright color andmake them almost targets or
507,00:23:59.77,00:23:59.77,bullet points.
508,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,"- You know, I have a feeling"
509,00:24:02.10,00:24:02.10,those mosquito nets are going tobe the secret.
510,00:24:04.13,00:24:04.13,I think that's our secret
511,00:24:05.30,00:24:05.30,ingredient that'sgoing to win this thing.
512,00:24:07.50,00:24:07.50,- I'm going to have thisfeather in my ass and I'm...
513,00:24:15.43,00:24:15.43,(grunting)
514,00:24:18.90,00:24:18.90,- I was watching Lindsey for awhile and she was working really
515,00:24:21.07,00:24:21.07,"hard, we all were, and the nextthing I know, I looked over, and"
516,00:24:23.80,00:24:23.80,"she was sitting underneath theshade of a tree, and it's just"
517,00:24:25.77,00:24:25.77,not like her personality
518,00:24:27.10,00:24:27.10,to sit down beforea challenge was over.
519,00:24:29.63,00:24:29.63,And so I walked over to her andshe was crying and she looked
520,00:24:32.13,00:24:32.13,like she was in serious pain.
521,00:24:34.73,00:24:34.73,- (crying): I could take abroken bone over that.
522,00:24:37.07,00:24:37.07,- Her dehydration state todayand working really hard got her
523,00:24:39.90,00:24:39.90,"really sick, really fast."
524,00:24:41.37,00:24:41.37,She had some severe pain in herkidneys and in her stomach.
525,00:24:44.40,00:24:44.40,"I sat with her for quite awhile, trying to get her to"
526,00:24:46.70,00:24:46.70,"drink, but she keptspitting it up."
527,00:24:48.30,00:24:48.30,(spitting)
528,00:24:51.17,00:24:51.17,- I'd rather die right now than
529,00:24:52.63,00:24:52.63,"deal with this pain,I swear to God."
530,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,"If we don't both break out ofhere, I'm going to kill myself."
531,00:25:00.60,00:25:00.60,"- We're going to get Frankvoted out, don't you worry."
532,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40,"- Linda, can you go away,please?"
533,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,"- Are you okay, sweetie?"
534,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,- I'm fine.
535,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,- Okay.
536,00:25:10.73,00:25:10.73,- I get this funny feeling thatI'm probably the last person she
537,00:25:12.83,00:25:12.83,wanted to maybestumble upon her.
538,00:25:16.60,00:25:16.60,One of the things that Lindseylikes to say every day on a
539,00:25:18.90,00:25:18.90,regular basisis how strong she is.
540,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80,She's the strongest personthat she knows.
541,00:25:24.23,00:25:24.23,- I never feel pain.
542,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,- Guess she's not so strong.
543,00:25:34.53,00:25:34.53,"- Come on, plane!"
544,00:25:36.30,00:25:36.30,We want to be rescued.
545,00:25:37.77,00:25:37.77,"- Look at that, 56 years oldand nothing but 100% ""wo-man""!"
546,00:25:42.60,00:25:42.60,"Whoa, man!"
547,00:25:44.60,00:25:44.60,"- Gutsy, I'll tell you that."
548,00:25:47.00,00:25:47.00,"- We got a black man with whitetighties on, we got a big fat"
549,00:25:50.30,00:25:50.30,"man with a flag waving, we gottwo little skinny men with flags"
550,00:25:54.20,00:25:54.20,"running around, women in herthong there."
551,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,"We got a young lady shakin'and bakin' up there, so I don't"
552,00:26:00.53,00:26:00.53,know what else we could do.
553,00:26:01.97,00:26:01.97,"If that won't stop a plane,I want to talk to the pilot."
554,00:26:05.47,00:26:05.47,- Aren't our boys funny?
555,00:26:06.73,00:26:06.73,Desperate times call fordesperate measures.
556,00:26:08.53,00:26:08.53,"- Anything, anything to getthis challenge."
557,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,"- Yes, I'm excited."
558,00:26:11.80,00:26:11.80,I don't think Samburu are goingto take their clothes off.
559,00:26:25.13,00:26:25.13,- (Probst) Here's the setup.
560,00:26:26.40,00:26:26.40,We have an experienced rescue
561,00:26:28.83,00:26:28.83,pilot and an experienceddrop master.
562,00:26:31.47,00:26:31.47,"We're going to fly above bothcamps, these two experts are"
563,00:26:34.13,00:26:34.13,going to determine whichdistress signal would be most
564,00:26:37.93,00:26:37.93,clearly visible from the air ina rescue situation.
565,00:26:42.17,00:26:42.17,"The winning tribe will receivea crate-- inside the crate,"
566,00:26:46.30,00:26:46.30,the immunity idols.
567,00:26:54.47,00:26:54.47,"- Hey, guys,here he comes!"
568,00:26:57.17,00:26:57.17,"- Here he comes, guys!"
569,00:26:58.63,00:26:58.63,Whoo!
570,00:27:02.43,00:27:02.43,Wave it up if you've got it!
571,00:27:04.17,00:27:04.17,"- Oh, Frank, drop dead."
572,00:27:06.40,00:27:06.40,"- He's coming back, guys."
573,00:27:12.77,00:27:12.77,- Hello!
574,00:27:16.17,00:27:16.17,- (whistles)
575,00:27:19.43,00:27:19.43,"- (Probst) All right, Harold,that is Samburu tribe."
576,00:27:22.07,00:27:22.07,What's your thought on that?
577,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73,"- Well, theyused something..."
578,00:27:27.77,00:27:27.77,"as the ""O"" in the S.O.S.,but unfortunately"
579,00:27:32.07,00:27:32.07,it would look verysimilar to the other cattle
580,00:27:35.40,00:27:35.40,around this area.
581,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,- (Probst) So because it looksjust like every other community
582,00:27:40.57,00:27:40.57,"out here, if you're flying by,you might not notice it at all?"
583,00:27:44.43,00:27:44.43,"- You're absolutely right,I might just miss it, yeah."
584,00:27:46.47,00:27:46.47,"- (Probst) Okay, let's take alook at Boran."
585,00:27:48.53,00:27:48.53,"- Come on, get ready,the plane's coming!"
586,00:27:50.53,00:27:50.53,- Here we go now!
587,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,- Here we go!
588,00:27:54.90,00:27:54.90,(yelling)
589,00:28:09.40,00:28:09.40,(whistling)
590,00:28:16.50,00:28:16.50,"- Yeah, this one is reallygetting our attention here."
591,00:28:19.57,00:28:19.57,"And they're using four differentcolors and the words S.O.S.,"
592,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,"in a wide open area, that hasfew trees in it, so it's very,"
593,00:28:27.20,00:28:27.20,very visible.
594,00:28:28.67,00:28:28.67,And it would be much easier tosee this one.
595,00:28:32.20,00:28:32.20,"- (Probst) Okay, afterconferring with our rescue pilot"
596,00:28:34.87,00:28:34.87,"and Harold, our drop master,both have decided that because"
597,00:28:38.40,00:28:38.40,of the use of colorand also
598,00:28:40.00,00:28:40.00,"the terrain,Boran is the winning tribe."
599,00:28:43.47,00:28:43.47,We will now drop the crate.
600,00:28:44.87,00:28:44.87,Boran has immunity.
601,00:28:47.63,00:28:47.63,"- 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, go!"
602,00:28:55.03,00:28:55.03,(cheering)
603,00:29:06.53,00:29:06.53,- Yeah!
604,00:29:08.53,00:29:08.53,"- Yep, they justdropped a bag."
605,00:29:10.23,00:29:10.23,- That's it.
606,00:29:12.37,00:29:12.37,- Wait a minute.
607,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,"- No, it's not coming back."
608,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,"- No, it's gone."
609,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,"- I think there are a lot ofspirits out here, and I believe"
610,00:29:17.37,00:29:17.37,our idol goddess will not livein a home of conflict.
611,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00,"And that's why she left us,she went to find some peace."
612,00:29:25.73,00:29:25.73,I believe that.
613,00:29:27.47,00:29:27.47,I believe that.
614,00:29:45.20,00:29:45.20,"- Morning, Lindsey."
615,00:29:46.63,00:29:46.63,"- Hey, what's up?"
616,00:29:47.67,00:29:47.67,"- How you feeling today,Lindsey?"
617,00:29:48.80,00:29:48.80,- Like a million bucks.
618,00:29:49.83,00:29:49.83,"- Good, good."
619,00:29:51.43,00:29:51.43,"- I'm going to be in the shademost of the day, resting."
620,00:29:54.13,00:29:54.13,"- Put your sunscreen on,drink a lot of water."
621,00:29:56.67,00:29:56.67,- No reason to exert myself.
622,00:29:59.07,00:29:59.07,"- Well, what happened yesterdaywas, I was dehydrated and when"
623,00:30:02.27,00:30:02.27,"you're dehydrated,every other"
624,00:30:04.97,00:30:04.97,problem area ofyour body is exacerbated.
625,00:30:07.40,00:30:07.40,"So, my kidneys were sore, mystomach was sore-- I'm still"
626,00:30:10.70,00:30:10.70,"a little bit groggy and a littleweak, but I'm going to be really"
627,00:30:13.13,00:30:13.13,cognizant of my water intake.
628,00:30:15.70,00:30:15.70,"But, you know what, it canhappen to anyone of you,"
629,00:30:16.77,00:30:16.77,so be careful.
630,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,"- Hey, believe me,I know it."
631,00:30:19.30,00:30:19.30,It could be any one of us.
632,00:30:20.77,00:30:20.77,- For the older people to seeher down was like a thumb up on
633,00:30:23.97,00:30:23.97,"their side-- it was just a, youknow, shake hands, a smile and a"
634,00:30:27.73,00:30:27.73,"cheerio, you know, hey, they gotone down, we're stronger."
635,00:30:30.97,00:30:30.97,I hated for them to get thatlittle sweet flavor of victory
636,00:30:34.13,00:30:34.13,in their mouth.
637,00:30:35.13,00:30:35.13,- Barbie went down in Africa.
638,00:30:36.60,00:30:36.60,- I agree.
639,00:30:38.10,00:30:38.10,You don't sit in this kind ofheat for two days and sunbathe
640,00:30:40.20,00:30:40.20,and then do a physical andmental exertion like this and
641,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,not expect you're goingto fall apart.
642,00:30:44.80,00:30:44.80,I don't care ifyou're 18 years old.
643,00:30:46.50,00:30:46.50,"- Tensions are high-- I mean,you can cut it with a knife,"
644,00:30:49.57,00:30:49.57,"you know, right throughthe air."
645,00:30:50.63,00:30:50.63,"The youngerpeople, they know"
646,00:30:51.67,00:30:51.67,we're going toTribal Council tonight.
647,00:30:53.47,00:30:53.47,I have no flexibility.
648,00:30:54.93,00:30:54.93,"If you're excess baggage,get the hell out of my way."
649,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,"I'm not going to deal with it,not under these conditions."
650,00:31:04.73,00:31:04.73,"- Throw on my shirt,get my bag."
651,00:31:12.80,00:31:12.80,- Everyone knows we're not muchof a tribe anymore.
652,00:31:15.40,00:31:15.40,We don't have much unity.
653,00:31:16.90,00:31:16.90,"And on some deeper level, I'msure what most people are"
654,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30,"thinking, ""What's the harm if wego to Tribal Council?"
655,00:31:23.27,00:31:23.27,"Let's get it over with."""
656,00:31:38.43,00:31:38.43,"- (Probst) Before you get toocomfortable, I want you to each"
657,00:31:40.97,00:31:40.97,"grab a torch, approachthe flame, and light it up."
658,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,Put it back in its slot.
659,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,This is part of the ritualat Tribal Council because
660,00:31:49.40,00:31:49.40,"at Tribal Council, fire doesrepresent life."
661,00:31:54.07,00:31:54.07,You'll take these back with youto camp tonight and bring them
662,00:31:56.13,00:31:56.13,to future Tribal Councils.
663,00:32:02.20,00:32:02.20,"Well, welcome to your firstTribal Council."
664,00:32:04.67,00:32:04.67,"Is this a big deal, not thatbig a deal, do you care?"
665,00:32:07.97,00:32:07.97,"- Yeah, we care."
666,00:32:09.23,00:32:09.23,Everyone's a member of ourtribe.
667,00:32:10.87,00:32:10.87,- Just being here withbuddies for nine days under
668,00:32:13.27,00:32:13.27,these conditionswould be tough.
669,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,"You guysdon't know each other,"
670,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,I'm not sure you evenlike each other.
671,00:32:18.80,00:32:18.80,"Brandon, what's it been likethe first nine days so far,"
672,00:32:21.53,00:32:21.53,in getting along?
673,00:32:22.80,00:32:22.80,"- It hasn't been thatunpleasant, actually,"
674,00:32:24.43,00:32:24.43,"surprisingly, for this manydifferent kind of personalities."
675,00:32:27.60,00:32:27.60,"- (Probst) Lindsey, you're"
676,00:32:28.63,00:32:28.63,cracking up at Brandon'scomments.
677,00:32:30.13,00:32:30.13,What do youfind funny about it?
678,00:32:31.57,00:32:31.57,"- Oh, I just, I thinkit's been great."
679,00:32:33.47,00:32:33.47,I think we've allgot along really well.
680,00:32:35.87,00:32:35.87,"- It hasn't been one,big, happy party."
681,00:32:37.67,00:32:37.67,"We've had a little tension inthe tribe, we have problems."
682,00:32:39.47,00:32:39.47,We have a water problem.
683,00:32:41.03,00:32:41.03,"We have a pot problem and, youknow, we need to take things"
684,00:32:43.10,00:32:43.10,seriouslyand we need to have
685,00:32:44.47,00:32:44.47,"a rotation, and nobody reallyhas a defined job."
686,00:32:46.97,00:32:46.97,We're not onthe same page all the time.
687,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,"You know, we need to be on thesame page and work as a team,"
688,00:32:51.87,00:32:51.87,and sometimes I don't see usworking as a team.
689,00:32:53.63,00:32:53.63,"- Silas, how do yourespond to Carl's take that"
690,00:32:56.23,00:32:56.23,maybe the work ethic isn'tthe same with everybody?
691,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,- I think Carl is right on.
692,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,"Jeff, I also feel thatin a group like this you have to"
693,00:33:06.53,00:33:06.53,"mold, you have to change,you have to bend."
694,00:33:09.47,00:33:09.47,"And if youdon't bend, you'll break."
695,00:33:13.70,00:33:13.70,- What is with the...maybe you've had these and I
696,00:33:16.07,00:33:16.07,"didn't notice, necklace,necklace, necklace."
697,00:33:19.23,00:33:19.23,I think you havea necklace on under there.
698,00:33:21.30,00:33:21.30,- Mm-hmm.
699,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,"- No necklace,no necklace, Frank, no necklace."
700,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,Is that symbolic of anythinggoing on?
701,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,- It's jewelry.
702,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,- Absolutely.
703,00:33:30.80,00:33:30.80,"- (Probst) So Silas, Kim,Lindsey and Brandon, you guys"
704,00:33:34.10,00:33:34.10,have formed some sort of afriendship?
705,00:33:35.93,00:33:35.93,"- Oh, yeah."
706,00:33:35.93,00:33:35.93,"- Oh, yeah."
707,00:33:37.63,00:33:37.63,- Most definitely.
708,00:33:37.63,00:33:37.63,"- Oh, yeah."
709,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,- Does that friendshipinclude any of the four older
710,00:33:42.80,00:33:42.80,"people in the group, or is thatjust coincidence?"
711,00:33:46.43,00:33:46.43,- It doesn't disclude them.
712,00:33:47.73,00:33:47.73,"- It's a different kind offriendship, yeah."
713,00:33:48.93,00:33:48.93,- We're all friends.
714,00:33:50.30,00:33:50.30,"We're all friends,but on different levels."
715,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,"- Because asyou guys are talking,"
716,00:33:54.43,00:33:54.43,these guys are allsmiling.
717,00:33:55.60,00:33:55.60,"- Jeff, when wewent into our"
718,00:33:57.43,00:33:57.43,challenges we all decided towear these buffs together.
719,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,We're a team.
720,00:34:01.87,00:34:01.87,Unity? I want to knowwhere my necklace is.
721,00:34:06.50,00:34:06.50,"- Brandon,feel vulnerable at all"
722,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07,for this vote that'scoming up?
723,00:34:09.60,00:34:09.60,"- Oh, I can't imagine anybodythat's sitting here right now"
724,00:34:11.33,00:34:11.33,"that said they weren't feelingvulnerable, I think anybody that"
725,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,said they weren't wouldbe lying.
726,00:34:15.60,00:34:15.60,"- Lindsey, worried at all?"
727,00:34:17.20,00:34:17.20,- Yeah. Definitely.
728,00:34:18.53,00:34:18.53,- (Probst) Why? What would makesomebody vote you out?
729,00:34:20.90,00:34:20.90,"- Well, I dehydrated yesterdaypretty bad and passed out,"
730,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"I don't know, people couldsee that as a weakness."
731,00:34:27.50,00:34:27.50,"Other than that, I think I getalong with everyone pretty well."
732,00:34:31.80,00:34:31.80,"I mean, I'm just as vulnerableas the next person."
733,00:34:35.30,00:34:35.30,"- (Probst)How about you, Frank?"
734,00:34:36.57,00:34:36.57,- Unfortunately I'm sometimestoo aggressive.
735,00:34:39.27,00:34:39.27,"You know, doesn't leave too muchroom for a friendly smile and"
736,00:34:41.97,00:34:41.97,"everything, you know,when the basics have to be met."
737,00:34:44.23,00:34:44.23,So I could be misjudgedfor that.
738,00:34:46.90,00:34:46.90,"- All right,let's do this."
739,00:34:48.50,00:34:48.50,"Kim, you're up first."
740,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"- Great guy, doesn't needthe money, he's got his future"
741,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,"already in store for him,I think he needs to go."
742,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,"- In a survival situation,"
743,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,everyone has to carrytheir own weight.
744,00:35:27.80,00:35:27.80,I just felt you didn't.
745,00:35:54.57,00:35:54.57,"- I like this person, I thinkthis person has a lot of"
746,00:35:58.00,00:35:58.00,"potential, but one must rememberthat mother Africa is a very"
747,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,"spiritual place,the gods and goddesses"
748,00:36:04.50,00:36:04.50,are watching andlistening.
749,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,- I'll go tally the votes.
750,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final,"
751,00:36:36.70,00:36:36.70,the personwill be asked to leave
752,00:36:38.03,00:36:38.03,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
753,00:36:39.93,00:36:39.93,I'll read the votes.
754,00:36:45.03,00:36:45.03,First vote...

756,00:36:54.37,00:36:54.37,Lindsey.
757,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,Carl.
758,00:37:06.07,00:37:06.07,Doc Carl.
759,00:37:08.53,00:37:08.53,"That's two votes Carl,two votes Lindsey."
760,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,"Dr. B, that's Carl."
761,00:37:20.53,00:37:20.53,Carl.
762,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,"Four votes Carl,two votes Lindsey."
763,00:37:29.20,00:37:29.20,"Four votes Carl, three votesLindsey."
764,00:37:33.07,00:37:33.07,Last vote.
765,00:37:37.60,00:37:37.60,We have a tie.
766,00:37:43.37,00:37:43.37,"Okay, so this iswhat's going to happen."
767,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"Carl, Lindsey, you guys are bothgoing to have a chance to plead"
768,00:37:48.77,00:37:48.77,your case to your tribe as towhy you should stay.
769,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,Why youshouldn't be voted out.
770,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,"And then we're going to revote,voting for either Lindsey or"
771,00:37:57.40,00:37:57.40,Carl-- you two won't vote.
772,00:37:59.27,00:37:59.27,"Carl, state your case."
773,00:38:00.80,00:38:00.80,"- From day one, I told you thisis what you get-- I work hard,"
774,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,I maintained a sensibility oftrying to make you people have
775,00:38:08.27,00:38:08.27,"water, fire,I've worked my tail off."
776,00:38:11.10,00:38:11.10,I don't think anybodyhere can
777,00:38:12.40,00:38:12.40,sit here and look me in the eyeand say I've slacked.
778,00:38:14.23,00:38:14.23,"I'm a man of honor, I gaveyou my word, I've worked hard,"
779,00:38:16.93,00:38:16.93,and I think I'm a valuableasset to this tribe.
780,00:38:19.07,00:38:19.07,That's all I have to say.
781,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,- Lindsey.
782,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40,"- I'm not the most domesticperson around, I don't know how"
783,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83,"to cook the mush yet, you know,I don't know how to maintain"
784,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40,"a fire that well, but I'mlearning, and I'm willing to"
785,00:38:29.30,00:38:29.30,"learn and I put in my work whenI need to, and at the challenges"
786,00:38:32.57,00:38:32.57,nobody can stop me.
787,00:38:34.17,00:38:34.17,"Carl has made it really clearthat he's very successful,"
788,00:38:37.20,00:38:37.20,"he has a lot of money,he's really happy in his life,"
789,00:38:39.97,00:38:39.97,"and it's a game for money,and you don't need it."
790,00:38:44.37,00:38:44.37,- (Probst) Okay.
791,00:38:45.57,00:38:45.57,"Kim, you're first,I'm going to ask you"
792,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,to take this back upwith you.
793,00:39:10.73,00:39:10.73,I'll go tally the votes.
794,00:39:20.87,00:39:20.87,Same rulesapply on the re-vote.

796,00:39:24.77,00:39:24.77,person voted out willbe asked to leave
797,00:39:26.50,00:39:26.50,the TribalCouncil area immediately.
