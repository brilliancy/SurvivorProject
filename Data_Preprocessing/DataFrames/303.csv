1,00:00:01.73,00:00:01.73,(Jeff Probst) Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.37,00:00:03.37,"- If we wanted to make this work, we should have picked the"
3,00:00:04.57,00:00:04.57,"strongest one of us, and that was you."
4,00:00:06.43,00:00:06.43,"- (Probst) At Samburu, Silas' loyalty wavered between"
5,00:00:08.33,00:00:08.33,the young and the old.
6,00:00:09.60,00:00:09.60,"- We're going to take it all the way, trust me."
7,00:00:11.40,00:00:11.40,"I mean, we're here to win a million dollars."
8,00:00:13.53,00:00:13.53,So I'm going to do what it takes to win.
9,00:00:16.27,00:00:16.27,"- (Probst) Boran continued their losing streak, when Samburu won"
10,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,"both the reward and immunity challenges,"
11,00:00:21.93,00:00:21.93,pitting the boys against the girls at Boran.
12,00:00:25.57,00:00:25.57,- Wouldn't shock me if the four
13,00:00:27.03,00:00:27.03,of them thought they could do it better without any of us.
14,00:00:29.00,00:00:29.00,- (Probst) Jessie became the target when she got sick.
15,00:00:32.13,00:00:32.13,"Jessie, the tribe has spoken."
16,00:00:36.27,00:00:36.27,It's time for you to go.
17,00:00:37.70,00:00:37.70,14 are left.
18,00:00:39.33,00:00:39.33,Who will go next?

20,00:01:47.53,00:01:47.53,(lion roaring)
21,00:02:07.60,00:02:07.60,- We are in wild Africa.
22,00:02:11.30,00:02:11.30,(lion roaring)
23,00:02:13.10,00:02:13.10,- It was that way.
24,00:02:17.40,00:02:17.40,- Go away!
25,00:02:20.50,00:02:20.50,- That sounded like maybe something that he got.
26,00:02:27.33,00:02:27.33,(roaring)
27,00:02:37.03,00:02:37.03,- Lex...
28,00:02:40.10,00:02:40.10,"We could hear it actually breathe, we heard its wheeze,"
29,00:02:43.87,00:02:43.87,"as it inhaled, it was kind of like..."
30,00:02:46.07,00:02:46.07,(wheezing)
31,00:02:52.43,00:02:52.43,- You guys hear him breathing? You hear him breathing?
32,00:02:54.40,00:02:54.40,- We hear him breathing.
33,00:02:55.60,00:02:55.60,He's right outside the fence.
34,00:02:58.93,00:02:58.93,"- I mean, it was, it made my blood run cold."
35,00:03:01.30,00:03:01.30,"We went into this thing knowing, yeah, it's going to be tough,"
36,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,"it's going to be real, but I don't think any of us really"
37,00:03:05.07,00:03:05.07,considered that it was going to be quite that real.
38,00:03:12.00,00:03:12.00,"- It's the worst feeling in the world, like, getting startled"
39,00:03:15.30,00:03:15.30,out of your sleep by a roar.
40,00:03:20.33,00:03:20.33,"- My mind said stay, but my feet said go."
41,00:03:23.13,00:03:23.13,"I mean, it's all I could do to keep from just running"
42,00:03:26.10,00:03:26.10,"somewhere, but there's nowhere to run."
43,00:03:28.27,00:03:28.27,- Go away!
44,00:03:31.50,00:03:31.50,"- I heard one from over there, and I heard one from over there."
45,00:03:35.00,00:03:35.00,"I mean, unless he's circling."
46,00:03:38.33,00:03:38.33,- I heard more than one animal.
47,00:03:42.50,00:03:42.50,"- There was growls coming from our east end and then, minutes"
48,00:03:46.07,00:03:46.07,"later, from our west end and we thought he was just, like,"
49,00:03:49.07,00:03:49.07,"pacing, but, as it turns out, there were two lions."
50,00:03:57.63,00:03:57.63,"If you're approached by an animal, you don't run and"
51,00:04:00.20,00:04:00.20,hopefully everything will work out.
52,00:04:01.90,00:04:01.90,You're not going to beat a beast.
53,00:04:03.47,00:04:03.47,(roaring)
54,00:04:04.87,00:04:04.87,- That was real.
55,00:04:04.87,00:04:04.87,- It's still real.
56,00:04:06.97,00:04:06.97,- This is probably going to happen every night.
57,00:04:09.20,00:04:09.20,"- What do you do if it comes in, what do you do if it starts"
58,00:04:11.33,00:04:11.33,scraping at the fence?
59,00:04:33.47,00:04:33.47,- Morning.
60,00:04:34.60,00:04:34.60,- Morning.
61,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,- Why do we get up so early?
62,00:04:40.03,00:04:40.03,- I don't know.
63,00:04:42.53,00:04:42.53,Because everyone else does.
64,00:04:44.13,00:04:44.13,"- First thing in the morning, the four of us like to sleep a"
65,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,little bit later and the four older people get up a little bit
66,00:04:48.93,00:04:48.93,"before us, and so they decided this morning that they wanted to"
67,00:04:51.43,00:04:51.43,go get water before any of us were even up or had shoes on or
68,00:04:53.93,00:04:53.93,"whatever so, they took off."
69,00:04:55.13,00:04:55.13,- We're going down to the water.
70,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,Does anybody want to come?
71,00:04:57.87,00:04:57.87,- We're not quite up yet.
72,00:04:59.40,00:04:59.40,- I so don't want to go down there right now.
73,00:05:02.17,00:05:02.17,"- Of course I went to get the water, because if I don't get"
74,00:05:03.77,00:05:03.77,"up, it's not going to get done."
75,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,You think anybody else gets off their ass to do anything?
76,00:05:07.07,00:05:07.07,"I'm starting to wonder here, I'm like, look, I'm the old guy,"
77,00:05:10.20,00:05:10.20,"okay, but I know what needs to be done-- every morning, fire,"
78,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,water and food.
79,00:05:14.53,00:05:14.53,"- Well, I was going to do the breakfast,"
80,00:05:16.20,00:05:16.20,but you want to swap off?
81,00:05:17.40,00:05:17.40,- I'll do breakfast.
82,00:05:18.90,00:05:18.90,"- You do breakfast, I'll do water this morning?"
83,00:05:20.70,00:05:20.70,- That's cool.
84,00:05:20.70,00:05:20.70,- Are you sure?
85,00:05:21.90,00:05:21.90,- I have no problem with that.
86,00:05:23.07,00:05:23.07,- Because I was going to do breakfast.
87,00:05:24.20,00:05:24.20,"- No, don't worry about it."
88,00:05:25.50,00:05:25.50,"- We got all the gourds, they got the knife."
89,00:05:26.67,00:05:26.67,"You want your canteen, babe?"
90,00:05:28.13,00:05:28.13,"- Yeah, I'll take it with."
91,00:05:29.60,00:05:29.60,- The older group seems a little bit nervous.
92,00:05:32.47,00:05:32.47,"Basically, we kind of feel like they're sucking up to us a"
93,00:05:35.37,00:05:35.37,"little bit, so, yeah, I mean, if they'll go get the water and we"
94,00:05:39.53,00:05:39.53,"don't need to help, why not?"
95,00:05:40.63,00:05:40.63,We want to save our strength.
96,00:05:42.10,00:05:42.10,"- Y'all, don't ever forget what they've been putting us through"
97,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,the last six days.
98,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"They are conniving, miserable little people, that were walking"
99,00:05:49.07,00:05:49.07,around talking about us.
100,00:05:50.33,00:05:50.33,So don't forget for one second...
101,00:05:51.73,00:05:51.73,- They're talking about it right now.
102,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,- They are talking about it right now.
103,00:05:56.37,00:05:56.37,- Remember when Silas said what he thought would be a good idea
104,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,was if the four of us voted one way?
105,00:06:02.13,00:06:02.13,- Right.
106,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,- And then he would get them to split their votes?
107,00:06:05.60,00:06:05.60,- Right.
108,00:06:07.07,00:06:07.07,"- I think that's what he's got in mind, so he doesn't come out"
109,00:06:09.97,00:06:09.97,being the bad guy.
110,00:06:11.40,00:06:11.40,"- T-bird, he should have at least said to you, you know,"
111,00:06:14.80,00:06:14.80,"even me, ""Look, this is what I'm doing."
112,00:06:17.17,00:06:17.17,"This is my strategy."""
113,00:06:18.23,00:06:18.23,We'll see.
114,00:06:19.50,00:06:19.50,- We're just wondering if Silas is still with us or not.
115,00:06:22.00,00:06:22.00,"My gut feeling just says he's playing, playing both sides."
116,00:06:26.13,00:06:26.13,But I'm not-- I can't be for sure.
117,00:06:29.00,00:06:29.00,"- Don't go home with broken spirits,"
118,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,I was just saying that to T.
119,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,- My spirit is not broken.
120,00:06:34.30,00:06:34.30,- Because this place can just fill our spirits so much.
121,00:06:38.87,00:06:38.87,"There's so much to be taken away from here, and just, you know,"
122,00:06:42.20,00:06:42.20,"try not to let people get to you, because that's what they"
123,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,want to do.
124,00:06:51.50,00:06:51.50,- I like to cook because I like
125,00:06:53.27,00:06:53.27,"my gruel, like, fried a certain way."
126,00:06:56.10,00:06:56.10,"Plus, if I'm cooking, then my..."
127,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17,"team, my friends get a little"
128,00:07:01.73,00:07:01.73,bit bigger portions and they get more.
129,00:07:04.97,00:07:04.97,We're going to act like these crispies are all we're having.
130,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,We didn't have mush.
131,00:07:08.40,00:07:08.40,We don't want them to think we ate their...
132,00:07:10.37,00:07:10.37,You know what I mean?
133,00:07:10.37,00:07:10.37,- Sure.
134,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,"- When Brandon was cooking, he said that we should have first"
135,00:07:15.43,00:07:15.43,dibs and we should pig out and eat as much as we can and leave
136,00:07:19.20,00:07:19.20,them whatever is left.
137,00:07:21.13,00:07:21.13,"I mean, if they want more,"
138,00:07:22.37,00:07:22.37,"they can make more, you know, that's fine."
139,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,- Ouch!
140,00:07:27.27,00:07:27.27,- Excellent.
141,00:07:36.83,00:07:36.83,- Did we not leave them any food?
142,00:07:39.63,00:07:39.63,"- I'm boiling some water, I'm boiling some water, so they can"
143,00:07:42.77,00:07:42.77,make it when they come back.
144,00:07:43.90,00:07:43.90,- Can I have that one?
145,00:07:45.57,00:07:45.57,- Is that them?
146,00:07:47.70,00:07:47.70,"- Your breakfast is burnt, probably."
147,00:07:50.53,00:07:50.53,We left it on the fire... Kim did.
148,00:08:08.53,00:08:08.53,- That sucked last night.
149,00:08:11.60,00:08:11.60,"- Oh, my gosh."
150,00:08:14.40,00:08:14.40,Big cat.
151,00:08:15.80,00:08:15.80,"- That, right there, is, like..."
152,00:08:18.67,00:08:18.67,"I mean, that's how big it is, that's how big the paw print is."
153,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,- The lions are probably right
154,00:08:23.30,00:08:23.30,"over there, sleeping in the grass, watching us."
155,00:08:25.07,00:08:25.07,"- Oh, yeah, they're sleeping, I think, during the day."
156,00:08:26.73,00:08:26.73,"- We know that they're around,"
157,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,and we know that they're really close.
158,00:08:28.87,00:08:28.87,- And they're not scared of us.
159,00:08:30.37,00:08:30.37,"- And, you know, would only lead us to believe-- don't you"
160,00:08:32.27,00:08:32.27,think-- that they would come around more and more and more?
161,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47,"- If we happen to be out and we see a lion during the day,"
162,00:08:36.97,00:08:36.97,we need to stand absolutely still.
163,00:08:39.40,00:08:39.40,"I mean, as soon as you run away, you immediately throw a signal"
164,00:08:42.87,00:08:42.87,"that you're prey, and that's just inviting the lion to"
165,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,just jump on you and maul you.
166,00:08:52.87,00:08:52.87,- We've got to fix that fence.
167,00:08:58.40,00:08:58.40,"- We've got some weak spots, little holes there, you know,"
168,00:09:01.50,00:09:01.50,they can slide under right down here.
169,00:09:03.87,00:09:03.87,So we're just trying to beef things up a bit.
170,00:09:25.60,00:09:25.60,"- Oh, my beads."
171,00:09:27.07,00:09:27.07,- The biggest problem we have
172,00:09:28.57,00:09:28.57,is we have two cracks in the water tubs.
173,00:09:30.70,00:09:30.70,They're putting on damn beads on a necklace.
174,00:09:33.00,00:09:33.00,Generation X.
175,00:09:34.47,00:09:34.47,"Like a putty sealer, huh?"
176,00:09:35.93,00:09:35.93,- Maybe it'll do the trick.
177,00:09:37.63,00:09:37.63,- Does the crack look like it's gone?
178,00:09:39.90,00:09:39.90,No?
179,00:09:42.47,00:09:42.47,I just can't sit around and not
180,00:09:44.70,00:09:44.70,"attempt something, you know what I mean?"
181,00:09:46.33,00:09:46.33,- One of my best friends made me a necklace and each bead is
182,00:09:49.30,00:09:49.30,"someone who's close to me, and my necklace broke, so Kim and I"
183,00:09:52.20,00:09:52.20,were sitting around trying to fix it.
184,00:09:53.83,00:09:53.83,"And I said, ""Well, now that we're a foursome, I think"
185,00:09:57.30,00:09:57.30,"each of you need to have a bead on my necklace,"""
186,00:09:59.53,00:09:59.53,"so I said, ""Hey, there's an idea."
187,00:10:01.33,00:10:01.33,I'll give you each your bead and we'll have these necklaces that
188,00:10:04.00,00:10:04.00,"represent that we're one unit,"
189,00:10:05.27,00:10:05.27,"like little kids in fifth grade."""
190,00:10:09.23,00:10:09.23,- How does it look?
191,00:10:10.63,00:10:10.63,- Give me your finger.
192,00:10:11.80,00:10:11.80,- Does it look nice?
193,00:10:13.10,00:10:13.10,- Stick your thumb back here.
194,00:10:14.40,00:10:14.40,"- Lindsey, making bead necklaces,"
195,00:10:16.73,00:10:16.73,that's a waste of time.
196,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,"Food, shelter, water."
197,00:10:20.30,00:10:20.30,"All efforts should be concentrated on that,"
198,00:10:22.63,00:10:22.63,"not here making beads, you know, not sun tanning yourself,"
199,00:10:25.97,00:10:25.97,all that is nonsense.
200,00:10:28.17,00:10:28.17,- How's that feel?
201,00:10:29.30,00:10:29.30,- Awesome.
202,00:10:31.10,00:10:31.10,"- The bead thing, it was flaunting right in your face,"
203,00:10:33.43,00:10:33.43,"like, it's the four of us and then there's the four of you,"
204,00:10:35.97,00:10:35.97,"and, yeah, it was definitely a slap in the face, but it's a"
205,00:10:38.23,00:10:38.23,"game and it was our strategy to try to drive them crazy and say,"
206,00:10:41.33,00:10:41.33,"""Hey, we are really, really unified."""
207,00:10:43.47,00:10:43.47,- Look at how careful I am back here.
208,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,- Are you done yet?
209,00:10:47.73,00:10:47.73,I can feel the heat.
210,00:10:52.83,00:10:52.83,- The necklaces could be
211,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,incredibly ballsy or incredibly stupid.
212,00:10:57.07,00:10:57.07,It just depends on how it falls.
213,00:11:00.40,00:11:00.40,It's fun either way.
214,00:11:03.33,00:11:03.33,"- How's that, is that good?"
215,00:11:04.80,00:11:04.80,"- That's good, yeah, you just tightened it up right there."
216,00:11:06.73,00:11:06.73,I was like...
217,00:11:08.33,00:11:08.33,"- The younger people, I think we've realized that if we don't"
218,00:11:10.63,00:11:10.63,"stick together, we're going to"
219,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,"lose this, they're going to pick us off."
220,00:11:14.77,00:11:14.77,And I'm not going out that way.
221,00:11:17.13,00:11:17.13,"And straddling the fence is over, period, it's done."
222,00:11:20.10,00:11:20.10,I am no longer with the older people
223,00:11:21.83,00:11:21.83,and I don't care if they know that.
224,00:11:23.47,00:11:23.47,"- Oh, my God."
225,00:11:24.47,00:11:24.47,- Just don't make her laugh.
226,00:11:27.27,00:11:27.27,- (laughing)
227,00:11:28.50,00:11:28.50,- Don't make her laugh.
228,00:11:29.80,00:11:29.80,- Okay.
229,00:11:30.97,00:11:30.97,"- They're immature,"
230,00:11:32.47,00:11:32.47,"they're trying to get under our skin, and its working."
231,00:11:34.07,00:11:34.07,- I must be the leader.
232,00:11:41.47,00:11:41.47,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
233,00:11:54.10,00:11:54.10,"- One of these days, I'm going"
234,00:11:55.60,00:11:55.60,to borrow this 20 grand when I get out of here.
235,00:11:57.23,00:11:57.23,- Listen to you.
236,00:11:58.27,00:11:58.27,"- Doc, all I want is 20 grand."
237,00:12:00.20,00:12:00.20,"- What would you do with 20 grand, Silas?"
238,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,- Get a vehicle.
239,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,"- Oh, cool."
240,00:12:04.83,00:12:04.83,- What do you drive?
241,00:12:05.90,00:12:05.90,- Huh?
242,00:12:05.90,00:12:05.90,- What do you drive?
243,00:12:07.43,00:12:07.43,- You don't want to know what I drive.
244,00:12:08.60,00:12:08.60,"- Yes, I do."
245,00:12:08.60,00:12:08.60,"- No, you don't wanna know."
246,00:12:09.67,00:12:09.67,"- Oh, tell me, Doc."
247,00:12:10.73,00:12:10.73,- I'm not telling you.
248,00:12:11.90,00:12:11.90,- Doc drives a Mercedes.
249,00:12:13.97,00:12:13.97,- I have one of those.
250,00:12:15.47,00:12:15.47,- What else?
251,00:12:16.50,00:12:16.50,- I'm not telling you.
252,00:12:18.03,00:12:18.03,- Is it a little car?
253,00:12:18.03,00:12:18.03,- A Porsche.
254,00:12:20.20,00:12:20.20,- It's a Porsche.
255,00:12:20.20,00:12:20.20,- You have a Porsche.
256,00:12:21.57,00:12:21.57,"- I'm trying to get under everybody's skin, I'm trying to"
257,00:12:23.30,00:12:23.30,"expose everybody the best I can,"
258,00:12:25.30,00:12:25.30,"you know, Doc, getting out all his..."
259,00:12:28.40,00:12:28.40,all his valuables and all his money and his Porsche.
260,00:12:30.70,00:12:30.70,"- I drive a Porsche, pardon me, you know what I mean."
261,00:12:33.80,00:12:33.80,"Silas brings it up as a negative, ""Look at the doc,"
262,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40,"he drives this, he drives that."""
263,00:12:37.87,00:12:37.87,"He's trying to plant seeds to Kim, Brandon and Lindsey."
264,00:12:40.40,00:12:40.40,It's not going to work.
265,00:12:41.57,00:12:41.57,All it does is shows his lack of maturity.
266,00:12:44.27,00:12:44.27,"She bought me the car for my birthday, it was a surprise."
267,00:12:46.03,00:12:46.03,You know why she bought it for me?
268,00:12:47.10,00:12:47.10,- Why?
269,00:12:48.10,00:12:48.10,- She said I would have never
270,00:12:49.20,00:12:49.20,"bought it for myself, and she's right."
271,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,I would have put the money in a mutual fund.
272,00:12:52.00,00:12:52.00,"- You know, it bothers me when he continually talks about"
273,00:12:53.83,00:12:53.83,"how much money he has, I mean, it does, it bugs me."
274,00:12:56.40,00:12:56.40,"It bugs the hell out of me, because, you know, the rest of"
275,00:12:59.07,00:12:59.07,us are here for the money.
276,00:13:00.83,00:13:00.83,- Feeling righteous?
277,00:13:01.83,00:13:01.83,"- I'm trying to seek, soak up"
278,00:13:03.37,00:13:03.37,"your wisdom, Doc, that's all I'm doing."
279,00:13:05.07,00:13:05.07,"- Just work hard, man."
280,00:13:06.13,00:13:06.13,- It's the key to life.
281,00:13:07.57,00:13:07.57,"- He wants to learn wisdom, he's not learning it that way."
282,00:13:09.77,00:13:09.77,You can't create a work ethic
283,00:13:11.47,00:13:11.47,when they've never had a work ethic.
284,00:13:13.67,00:13:13.67,This is Generation X.
285,00:13:15.00,00:13:15.00,This is definitely Generation X.
286,00:13:17.40,00:13:17.40,I'm glad I'm 46 years old and I'm glad I'm not part of it.
287,00:13:25.17,00:13:25.17,- Let's see what we got.
288,00:13:27.13,00:13:27.13,Something good.
289,00:13:28.20,00:13:28.20,Something heavy as hell.
290,00:13:31.40,00:13:31.40,"""Gather no moss as you roll"
291,00:13:33.40,00:13:33.40,"""the stone and work as a team, you can't do it alone."
292,00:13:36.90,00:13:36.90,"""This one's a tough one, do all you can do,"
293,00:13:39.97,00:13:39.97,"victory is refreshing with clean water and shampoo."""
294,00:13:43.80,00:13:43.80,- So we got to roll a stone.
295,00:13:46.17,00:13:46.17,- Rolling a stone?
296,00:13:47.63,00:13:47.63,- It would just feel good to
297,00:13:48.97,00:13:48.97,"win something, and it would feel good for our tribe."
298,00:13:50.90,00:13:50.90,We've lost two people already.
299,00:13:52.30,00:13:52.30,"You know, it's nice to win."
300,00:14:09.27,00:14:09.27,"- (Probst) Hey, guys."
301,00:14:10.97,00:14:10.97,"Today's challenge, it is for a reward,"
302,00:14:13.43,00:14:13.43,and it's a very simple challenge.
303,00:14:14.87,00:14:14.87,Each tribe has one huge boulder.
304,00:14:17.20,00:14:17.20,"Your goal-- navigate this boulder along the marked course,"
305,00:14:20.93,00:14:20.93,"get to it the finish line, and in its final resting spot."
306,00:14:24.73,00:14:24.73,"Now, to the reward."
307,00:14:26.03,00:14:26.03,What is the single most important element
308,00:14:28.40,00:14:28.40,"so far, out here in Africa?"
309,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57,- Water.
310,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57,- Water.
311,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,Here's what's you're playing for.
312,00:14:32.87,00:14:32.87,"100 gallons, fresh, clean"
313,00:14:36.40,00:14:36.40,drinking water delivered to your camp tomorrow morning.
314,00:14:39.43,00:14:39.43,- Tomorrow morning.
315,00:14:40.90,00:14:40.90,- (Probst) It's enough water for every tribe member to have a
316,00:14:43.40,00:14:43.40,gallon of water a day until the merge.
317,00:14:45.30,00:14:45.30,- Wow!
318,00:14:46.50,00:14:46.50,"- Oh, don't waste it! Don't waste a drop."
319,00:14:48.40,00:14:48.40,"Oh, you're wasting it."
320,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03,- It's very clean.
321,00:14:51.10,00:14:51.10,Very fresh.
322,00:14:52.27,00:14:52.27,"If you're so inclined, some organic shampoo,"
323,00:14:55.20,00:14:55.20,"if you want to waste it taking a shower,"
324,00:14:56.27,00:14:56.27,washing your hair or whatever.
325,00:14:57.77,00:14:57.77,"Samburu, because you have two extra members, you have to sit"
326,00:15:00.70,00:15:00.70,"two people out on this, keeping in mind, today we're playing for"
327,00:15:03.87,00:15:03.87,"a reward, tomorrow we're playing for immunity."
328,00:15:06.60,00:15:06.60,Nobody can sit out in back-to-back challenges.
329,00:15:09.40,00:15:09.40,I'll give you guys a minute to strategize.
330,00:15:11.33,00:15:11.33,Wait for my start.
331,00:15:13.07,00:15:13.07,"Samburu, who's sitting out?"
332,00:15:15.47,00:15:15.47,- Kim and Brandon.
333,00:15:16.97,00:15:16.97,- (Probst) All right.
334,00:15:19.50,00:15:19.50,"Here we go, guys!"
335,00:15:21.13,00:15:21.13,"100 gallons of fresh, clean, drinking water at stake!"

340,00:15:47.90,00:15:47.90,"Come on, to the left, to the left."
341,00:15:49.93,00:15:49.93,"- This way, this way, towards me."

408,00:18:49.93,00:18:49.93,- We're on!
409,00:18:51.07,00:18:51.07,- All right!
410,00:18:52.43,00:18:52.43,(cheering)
411,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,- Samburu!
412,00:19:08.00,00:19:08.00,- Samburu!
413,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13,- Yeah!
414,00:19:14.27,00:19:14.27,"- (Probst) Boran, you got your first taste of victory--"
415,00:19:17.27,00:19:17.27,along with it comes 100 gallons of fresh water.
416,00:19:20.20,00:19:20.20,You'll have the water in your camp by tomorrow morning.
417,00:19:31.53,00:19:31.53,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
418,00:19:39.73,00:19:39.73,- Everything around here revolves around water.
419,00:19:42.67,00:19:42.67,"The key to survival out here, now it's here."
420,00:19:46.37,00:19:46.37,- That is so great.
421,00:19:49.50,00:19:49.50,- How beautiful is this.
422,00:19:51.03,00:19:51.03,- It's great.
423,00:19:53.47,00:19:53.47,"- Another thing we don't have to worry about,"
424,00:19:55.73,00:19:55.73,getting water today.
425,00:19:57.33,00:19:57.33,- This is so nice.
426,00:20:37.27,00:20:37.27,- Good Lord.
427,00:20:38.83,00:20:38.83,- That just came out of nowhere.
428,00:20:40.47,00:20:40.47,"- Out of nowhere, right."
429,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67,- What the hell just happened?
430,00:20:43.27,00:20:43.27,"- I know, I'm like afraid to get out from under these nets,"
431,00:20:44.93,00:20:44.93,I'm sure there are bugs all in that.
432,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"- Hey, little guy."
433,00:20:53.80,00:20:53.80,Ow.
434,00:20:55.47,00:20:55.47,"Oh, a little basket."
435,00:20:55.47,00:20:55.47,- Uh-oh.
436,00:20:57.27,00:20:57.27,- We have mail!
437,00:20:58.30,00:20:58.30,"- Hit me, girls."
438,00:20:59.37,00:20:59.37,"- Read it to us, baby."
439,00:21:00.87,00:21:00.87,"- ""Now you're lost in the wild, and there's no one around."
440,00:21:04.43,00:21:04.43,"""You might find yourself thinking you'll never be found."
441,00:21:07.93,00:21:07.93,"""Muster all your resources, and don't stop to gloat."
442,00:21:12.23,00:21:12.23,"""Fail to get our attention, you'll be facing the vote."
443,00:21:16.53,00:21:16.53,"""Build us a message to be seen from the sky."
444,00:21:20.20,00:21:20.20,"If your signal's the best, immunity will drop by."""
445,00:21:25.40,00:21:25.40,"- Well, we got our mail this morning, and it was a very"
446,00:21:28.20,00:21:28.20,"unique, very different challenge."
447,00:21:29.87,00:21:29.87,"We found out that we had to make up some type of distress signal,"
448,00:21:32.57,00:21:32.57,so that planes flying overhead would be able to come and see
449,00:21:36.00,00:21:36.00,"us, and it was going to be a competition between us and the"
450,00:21:38.33,00:21:38.33,"other tribe, and whose distress signal was the better one."
451,00:21:40.67,00:21:40.67,"- We have a perfect ""O"" with thorn bushes."
452,00:21:43.53,00:21:43.53,"- Let's use our manyattas for the ""O."""
453,00:21:46.50,00:21:46.50,"To get a visual, you need"
454,00:21:47.80,00:21:47.80,"something light, something that hits them."
455,00:21:49.93,00:21:49.93,"So, yeah, let's do our S.O.S. like we're doing."
456,00:21:53.03,00:21:53.03,And then take all of our manmade
457,00:21:55.20,00:21:55.20,"supplies, accentuate it, they're going to see that thing."
458,00:22:01.40,00:22:01.40,- So you guys want to give up on the idea of using the...
459,00:22:04.30,00:22:04.30,"- Just hang on a second,"
460,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,"you're going to make two huge S's here, on each side."
461,00:22:08.27,00:22:08.27,- They don't have to be like manyattas though.
462,00:22:10.67,00:22:10.67,"From the air, you can't tell that it's raised."
463,00:22:12.23,00:22:12.23,"- That's right, but is it going"
464,00:22:13.57,00:22:13.57,to be here and on the other side?
465,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,- Yeah.
466,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,- Let's make it happen.
467,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,(whistling)
468,00:22:17.47,00:22:17.47,- Okay.
469,00:22:18.93,00:22:18.93,"- Frankly, the four of us would like to possibly see an older"
470,00:22:21.27,00:22:21.27,person have a little weak moment in the competition so they can
471,00:22:24.33,00:22:24.33,"all open their eyes, because they keep coming down saying"
472,00:22:26.90,00:22:26.90,the weak people need to go.
473,00:22:28.23,00:22:28.23,Just stick with me and we'll weed the weak ones out.
474,00:22:30.27,00:22:30.27,"- Hey, guys? Let's come together right now."
475,00:22:32.30,00:22:32.30,Everybody work on it right now.
476,00:22:34.83,00:22:34.83,"- You'd have to be a damn fool obviously, for me to go 110% out"
477,00:22:38.20,00:22:38.20,"there, drain my body of all energy that I have for a bunch"
478,00:22:41.63,00:22:41.63,of kids that aren't going to appreciate it.
479,00:22:43.90,00:22:43.90,"No, I just said, I'll contribute"
480,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,"and keep moving along, make it look good."
481,00:22:48.07,00:22:48.07,"Remember the heat, Linda, take a break,"
482,00:22:49.67,00:22:49.67,take a little sip of water.
483,00:22:51.63,00:22:51.63,Don't overexert yourself.
484,00:22:53.43,00:22:53.43,(groaning)
485,00:23:05.00,00:23:05.00,- Thank you.
486,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,- You guys can lift me up in
487,00:23:11.17,00:23:11.17,the air and I'll wave the horns like an airplane.
488,00:23:13.50,00:23:13.50,- You need something with bright colors that's going to
489,00:23:15.70,00:23:15.70,attract somebody from a distance.
490,00:23:17.13,00:23:17.13,"- The first thing I think you see,"
491,00:23:18.37,00:23:18.37,"rather than movement, would even be color."
492,00:23:19.87,00:23:19.87,"- We got to find a place, probably."
493,00:23:21.93,00:23:21.93,There's no grass or nothing right out there.
494,00:23:23.87,00:23:23.87,- Let's start taking stuff outside.
495,00:23:25.60,00:23:25.60,Let's grab all the mosquito nets and all the torches and stuff.
496,00:23:32.77,00:23:32.77,- Today's immunity challenge
497,00:23:34.27,00:23:34.27,"means absolutely everything to us, it's huge."
498,00:23:36.60,00:23:36.60,"We definitely need to win, so we're not another man down."
499,00:23:39.77,00:23:39.77,We can't afford to go down to
500,00:23:40.93,00:23:40.93,five and lose three of them in a row.
501,00:23:42.63,00:23:42.63,That's just unthinkable at this point.
502,00:23:44.40,00:23:44.40,"- I'll dipped this in a paint, I don't care."
503,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,- That's a good idea.
504,00:23:47.43,00:23:47.43,- You think red is the color?
505,00:23:48.83,00:23:48.83,- I had brought some acrylic paints with me as my luxury item
506,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,and suddenly got the idea to take these mosquito nets and
507,00:23:56.00,00:23:56.00,make them a bright color and make them almost targets or
508,00:23:59.77,00:23:59.77,bullet points.
509,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,"- You know, I have a feeling"
510,00:24:02.10,00:24:02.10,those mosquito nets are going to be the secret.
511,00:24:04.13,00:24:04.13,I think that's our secret
512,00:24:05.30,00:24:05.30,ingredient that's going to win this thing.
513,00:24:07.50,00:24:07.50,- I'm going to have this feather in my ass and I'm...
514,00:24:15.43,00:24:15.43,(grunting)
515,00:24:18.90,00:24:18.90,- I was watching Lindsey for a while and she was working really
516,00:24:21.07,00:24:21.07,"hard, we all were, and the next thing I know, I looked over, and"
517,00:24:23.80,00:24:23.80,"she was sitting underneath the shade of a tree, and it's just"
518,00:24:25.77,00:24:25.77,not like her personality
519,00:24:27.10,00:24:27.10,to sit down before a challenge was over.
520,00:24:29.63,00:24:29.63,And so I walked over to her and she was crying and she looked
521,00:24:32.13,00:24:32.13,like she was in serious pain.
522,00:24:34.73,00:24:34.73,- (crying): I could take a broken bone over that.
523,00:24:37.07,00:24:37.07,- Her dehydration state today and working really hard got her
524,00:24:39.90,00:24:39.90,"really sick, really fast."
525,00:24:41.37,00:24:41.37,She had some severe pain in her kidneys and in her stomach.
526,00:24:44.40,00:24:44.40,"I sat with her for quite a while, trying to get her to"
527,00:24:46.70,00:24:46.70,"drink, but she kept spitting it up."
528,00:24:48.30,00:24:48.30,(spitting)
529,00:24:51.17,00:24:51.17,- I'd rather die right now than
530,00:24:52.63,00:24:52.63,"deal with this pain, I swear to God."
531,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,"If we don't both break out of here, I'm going to kill myself."
532,00:25:00.60,00:25:00.60,"- We're going to get Frank voted out, don't you worry."
533,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40,"- Linda, can you go away, please?"
534,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,"- Are you okay, sweetie?"
535,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,- I'm fine.
536,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,- Okay.
537,00:25:10.73,00:25:10.73,- I get this funny feeling that I'm probably the last person she
538,00:25:12.83,00:25:12.83,wanted to maybe stumble upon her.
539,00:25:16.60,00:25:16.60,One of the things that Lindsey likes to say every day on a
540,00:25:18.90,00:25:18.90,regular basis is how strong she is.
541,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80,She's the strongest person that she knows.
542,00:25:24.23,00:25:24.23,- I never feel pain.
543,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,- Guess she's not so strong.
544,00:25:34.53,00:25:34.53,"- Come on, plane!"
545,00:25:36.30,00:25:36.30,We want to be rescued.
546,00:25:37.77,00:25:37.77,"- Look at that, 56 years old and nothing but 100% ""wo-man""!"
547,00:25:42.60,00:25:42.60,"Whoa, man!"
548,00:25:44.60,00:25:44.60,"- Gutsy, I'll tell you that."
549,00:25:47.00,00:25:47.00,"- We got a black man with white tighties on, we got a big fat"
550,00:25:50.30,00:25:50.30,"man with a flag waving, we got two little skinny men with flags"
551,00:25:54.20,00:25:54.20,"running around, women in her thong there."
552,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,"We got a young lady shakin' and bakin' up there, so I don't"
553,00:26:00.53,00:26:00.53,know what else we could do.
554,00:26:01.97,00:26:01.97,"If that won't stop a plane, I want to talk to the pilot."
555,00:26:05.47,00:26:05.47,- Aren't our boys funny?
556,00:26:06.73,00:26:06.73,Desperate times call for desperate measures.
557,00:26:08.53,00:26:08.53,"- Anything, anything to get this challenge."
558,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,"- Yes, I'm excited."
559,00:26:11.80,00:26:11.80,I don't think Samburu are going to take their clothes off.
560,00:26:25.13,00:26:25.13,- (Probst) Here's the setup.
561,00:26:26.40,00:26:26.40,We have an experienced rescue
562,00:26:28.83,00:26:28.83,pilot and an experienced drop master.
563,00:26:31.47,00:26:31.47,"We're going to fly above both camps, these two experts are"
564,00:26:34.13,00:26:34.13,going to determine which distress signal would be most
565,00:26:37.93,00:26:37.93,clearly visible from the air in a rescue situation.
566,00:26:42.17,00:26:42.17,"The winning tribe will receive a crate-- inside the crate,"
567,00:26:46.30,00:26:46.30,the immunity idols.
568,00:26:54.47,00:26:54.47,"- Hey, guys, here he comes!"
569,00:26:57.17,00:26:57.17,"- Here he comes, guys!"
570,00:26:58.63,00:26:58.63,Whoo!
571,00:27:02.43,00:27:02.43,Wave it up if you've got it!
572,00:27:04.17,00:27:04.17,"- Oh, Frank, drop dead."
573,00:27:06.40,00:27:06.40,"- He's coming back, guys."
574,00:27:12.77,00:27:12.77,- Hello!
575,00:27:16.17,00:27:16.17,- (whistles)
576,00:27:19.43,00:27:19.43,"- (Probst) All right, Harold, that is Samburu tribe."
577,00:27:22.07,00:27:22.07,What's your thought on that?
578,00:27:23.73,00:27:23.73,"- Well, they used something..."
579,00:27:27.77,00:27:27.77,"as the ""O"" in the S.O.S., but unfortunately"
580,00:27:32.07,00:27:32.07,it would look very similar to the other cattle
581,00:27:35.40,00:27:35.40,around this area.
582,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,- (Probst) So because it looks just like every other community
583,00:27:40.57,00:27:40.57,"out here, if you're flying by, you might not notice it at all?"
584,00:27:44.43,00:27:44.43,"- You're absolutely right, I might just miss it, yeah."
585,00:27:46.47,00:27:46.47,"- (Probst) Okay, let's take a look at Boran."
586,00:27:48.53,00:27:48.53,"- Come on, get ready, the plane's coming!"
587,00:27:50.53,00:27:50.53,- Here we go now!
588,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,- Here we go!
589,00:27:54.90,00:27:54.90,(yelling)
590,00:28:09.40,00:28:09.40,(whistling)
591,00:28:16.50,00:28:16.50,"- Yeah, this one is really getting our attention here."
592,00:28:19.57,00:28:19.57,"And they're using four different colors and the words S.O.S.,"
593,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,"in a wide open area, that has few trees in it, so it's very,"
594,00:28:27.20,00:28:27.20,very visible.
595,00:28:28.67,00:28:28.67,And it would be much easier to see this one.
596,00:28:32.20,00:28:32.20,"- (Probst) Okay, after conferring with our rescue pilot"
597,00:28:34.87,00:28:34.87,"and Harold, our drop master, both have decided that because"
598,00:28:38.40,00:28:38.40,of the use of color and also
599,00:28:40.00,00:28:40.00,"the terrain, Boran is the winning tribe."
600,00:28:43.47,00:28:43.47,We will now drop the crate.
601,00:28:44.87,00:28:44.87,Boran has immunity.
602,00:28:47.63,00:28:47.63,"- 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, go!"
603,00:28:55.03,00:28:55.03,(cheering)
604,00:29:06.53,00:29:06.53,- Yeah!
605,00:29:08.53,00:29:08.53,"- Yep, they just dropped a bag."
606,00:29:10.23,00:29:10.23,- That's it.
607,00:29:12.37,00:29:12.37,- Wait a minute.
608,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,"- No, it's not coming back."
609,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,"- No, it's gone."
610,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,"- I think there are a lot of spirits out here, and I believe"
611,00:29:17.37,00:29:17.37,our idol goddess will not live in a home of conflict.
612,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00,"And that's why she left us, she went to find some peace."
613,00:29:25.73,00:29:25.73,I believe that.
614,00:29:27.47,00:29:27.47,I believe that.
615,00:29:45.20,00:29:45.20,"- Morning, Lindsey."
616,00:29:46.63,00:29:46.63,"- Hey, what's up?"
617,00:29:47.67,00:29:47.67,"- How you feeling today, Lindsey?"
618,00:29:48.80,00:29:48.80,- Like a million bucks.
619,00:29:49.83,00:29:49.83,"- Good, good."
620,00:29:51.43,00:29:51.43,"- I'm going to be in the shade most of the day, resting."
621,00:29:54.13,00:29:54.13,"- Put your sunscreen on, drink a lot of water."
622,00:29:56.67,00:29:56.67,- No reason to exert myself.
623,00:29:59.07,00:29:59.07,"- Well, what happened yesterday was, I was dehydrated and when"
624,00:30:02.27,00:30:02.27,"you're dehydrated, every other"
625,00:30:04.97,00:30:04.97,problem area of your body is exacerbated.
626,00:30:07.40,00:30:07.40,"So, my kidneys were sore, my stomach was sore-- I'm still"
627,00:30:10.70,00:30:10.70,"a little bit groggy and a little weak, but I'm going to be really"
628,00:30:13.13,00:30:13.13,cognizant of my water intake.
629,00:30:15.70,00:30:15.70,"But, you know what, it can happen to anyone of you,"
630,00:30:16.77,00:30:16.77,so be careful.
631,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,"- Hey, believe me, I know it."
632,00:30:19.30,00:30:19.30,It could be any one of us.
633,00:30:20.77,00:30:20.77,- For the older people to see her down was like a thumb up on
634,00:30:23.97,00:30:23.97,"their side-- it was just a, you know, shake hands, a smile and a"
635,00:30:27.73,00:30:27.73,"cheerio, you know, hey, they got one down, we're stronger."
636,00:30:30.97,00:30:30.97,I hated for them to get that little sweet flavor of victory
637,00:30:34.13,00:30:34.13,in their mouth.
638,00:30:35.13,00:30:35.13,- Barbie went down in Africa.
639,00:30:36.60,00:30:36.60,- I agree.
640,00:30:38.10,00:30:38.10,You don't sit in this kind of heat for two days and sunbathe
641,00:30:40.20,00:30:40.20,and then do a physical and mental exertion like this and
642,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,not expect you're going to fall apart.
643,00:30:44.80,00:30:44.80,I don't care if you're 18 years old.
644,00:30:46.50,00:30:46.50,"- Tensions are high-- I mean, you can cut it with a knife,"
645,00:30:49.57,00:30:49.57,"you know, right through the air."
646,00:30:50.63,00:30:50.63,"The younger people, they know"
647,00:30:51.67,00:30:51.67,we're going to Tribal Council tonight.
648,00:30:53.47,00:30:53.47,I have no flexibility.
649,00:30:54.93,00:30:54.93,"If you're excess baggage, get the hell out of my way."
650,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,"I'm not going to deal with it, not under these conditions."
651,00:31:04.73,00:31:04.73,"- Throw on my shirt, get my bag."
652,00:31:12.80,00:31:12.80,- Everyone knows we're not much of a tribe anymore.
653,00:31:15.40,00:31:15.40,We don't have much unity.
654,00:31:16.90,00:31:16.90,"And on some deeper level, I'm sure what most people are"
655,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30,"thinking, ""What's the harm if we go to Tribal Council?"
656,00:31:23.27,00:31:23.27,"Let's get it over with."""
657,00:31:38.43,00:31:38.43,"- (Probst) Before you get too comfortable, I want you to each"
658,00:31:40.97,00:31:40.97,"grab a torch, approach the flame, and light it up."
659,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,Put it back in its slot.
660,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council because
661,00:31:49.40,00:31:49.40,"at Tribal Council, fire does represent life."
662,00:31:54.07,00:31:54.07,You'll take these back with you to camp tonight and bring them
663,00:31:56.13,00:31:56.13,to future Tribal Councils.
664,00:32:02.20,00:32:02.20,"Well, welcome to your first Tribal Council."
665,00:32:04.67,00:32:04.67,"Is this a big deal, not that big a deal, do you care?"
666,00:32:07.97,00:32:07.97,"- Yeah, we care."
667,00:32:09.23,00:32:09.23,Everyone's a member of our tribe.
668,00:32:10.87,00:32:10.87,- Just being here with buddies for nine days under
669,00:32:13.27,00:32:13.27,these conditions would be tough.
670,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,"You guys don't know each other,"
671,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,I'm not sure you even like each other.
672,00:32:18.80,00:32:18.80,"Brandon, what's it been like the first nine days so far,"
673,00:32:21.53,00:32:21.53,in getting along?
674,00:32:22.80,00:32:22.80,"- It hasn't been that unpleasant, actually,"
675,00:32:24.43,00:32:24.43,"surprisingly, for this many different kind of personalities."
676,00:32:27.60,00:32:27.60,"- (Probst) Lindsey, you're"
677,00:32:28.63,00:32:28.63,cracking up at Brandon's comments.
678,00:32:30.13,00:32:30.13,What do you find funny about it?
679,00:32:31.57,00:32:31.57,"- Oh, I just, I think it's been great."
680,00:32:33.47,00:32:33.47,I think we've all got along really well.
681,00:32:35.87,00:32:35.87,"- It hasn't been one, big, happy party."
682,00:32:37.67,00:32:37.67,"We've had a little tension in the tribe, we have problems."
683,00:32:39.47,00:32:39.47,We have a water problem.
684,00:32:41.03,00:32:41.03,"We have a pot problem and, you know, we need to take things"
685,00:32:43.10,00:32:43.10,seriously and we need to have
686,00:32:44.47,00:32:44.47,"a rotation, and nobody really has a defined job."
687,00:32:46.97,00:32:46.97,We're not on the same page all the time.
688,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,"You know, we need to be on the same page and work as a team,"
689,00:32:51.87,00:32:51.87,and sometimes I don't see us working as a team.
690,00:32:53.63,00:32:53.63,"- Silas, how do you respond to Carl's take that"
691,00:32:56.23,00:32:56.23,maybe the work ethic isn't the same with everybody?
692,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,- I think Carl is right on.
693,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,"Jeff, I also feel that in a group like this you have to"
694,00:33:06.53,00:33:06.53,"mold, you have to change, you have to bend."
695,00:33:09.47,00:33:09.47,"And if you don't bend, you'll break."
696,00:33:13.70,00:33:13.70,- What is with the... maybe you've had these and I
697,00:33:16.07,00:33:16.07,"didn't notice, necklace, necklace, necklace."
698,00:33:19.23,00:33:19.23,I think you have a necklace on under there.
699,00:33:21.30,00:33:21.30,- Mm-hmm.
700,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,"- No necklace, no necklace, Frank, no necklace."
701,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,Is that symbolic of anything going on?
702,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,- It's jewelry.
703,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,- Absolutely.
704,00:33:30.80,00:33:30.80,"- (Probst) So Silas, Kim, Lindsey and Brandon, you guys"
705,00:33:34.10,00:33:34.10,have formed some sort of a friendship?
706,00:33:35.93,00:33:35.93,"- Oh, yeah."
707,00:33:35.93,00:33:35.93,"- Oh, yeah."
708,00:33:37.63,00:33:37.63,- Most definitely.
709,00:33:37.63,00:33:37.63,"- Oh, yeah."
710,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,- Does that friendship include any of the four older
711,00:33:42.80,00:33:42.80,"people in the group, or is that just coincidence?"
712,00:33:46.43,00:33:46.43,- It doesn't disclude them.
713,00:33:47.73,00:33:47.73,"- It's a different kind of friendship, yeah."
714,00:33:48.93,00:33:48.93,- We're all friends.
715,00:33:50.30,00:33:50.30,"We're all friends, but on different levels."
716,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,"- Because as you guys are talking,"
717,00:33:54.43,00:33:54.43,these guys are all smiling.
718,00:33:55.60,00:33:55.60,"- Jeff, when we went into our"
719,00:33:57.43,00:33:57.43,challenges we all decided to wear these buffs together.
720,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,We're a team.
721,00:34:01.87,00:34:01.87,Unity? I want to know where my necklace is.
722,00:34:06.50,00:34:06.50,"- Brandon, feel vulnerable at all"
723,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07,for this vote that's coming up?
724,00:34:09.60,00:34:09.60,"- Oh, I can't imagine anybody that's sitting here right now"
725,00:34:11.33,00:34:11.33,"that said they weren't feeling vulnerable, I think anybody that"
726,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,said they weren't would be lying.
727,00:34:15.60,00:34:15.60,"- Lindsey, worried at all?"
728,00:34:17.20,00:34:17.20,- Yeah. Definitely.
729,00:34:18.53,00:34:18.53,- (Probst) Why? What would make somebody vote you out?
730,00:34:20.90,00:34:20.90,"- Well, I dehydrated yesterday pretty bad and passed out,"
731,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"I don't know, people could see that as a weakness."
732,00:34:27.50,00:34:27.50,"Other than that, I think I get along with everyone pretty well."
733,00:34:31.80,00:34:31.80,"I mean, I'm just as vulnerable as the next person."
734,00:34:35.30,00:34:35.30,"- (Probst) How about you, Frank?"
735,00:34:36.57,00:34:36.57,- Unfortunately I'm sometimes too aggressive.
736,00:34:39.27,00:34:39.27,"You know, doesn't leave too much room for a friendly smile and"
737,00:34:41.97,00:34:41.97,"everything, you know, when the basics have to be met."
738,00:34:44.23,00:34:44.23,So I could be misjudged for that.
739,00:34:46.90,00:34:46.90,"- All right, let's do this."
740,00:34:48.50,00:34:48.50,"Kim, you're up first."
741,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"- Great guy, doesn't need the money, he's got his future"
742,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,"already in store for him, I think he needs to go."
743,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,"- In a survival situation,"
744,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,everyone has to carry their own weight.
745,00:35:27.80,00:35:27.80,I just felt you didn't.
746,00:35:54.57,00:35:54.57,"- I like this person, I think this person has a lot of"
747,00:35:58.00,00:35:58.00,"potential, but one must remember that mother Africa is a very"
748,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,"spiritual place, the gods and goddesses"
749,00:36:04.50,00:36:04.50,are watching and listening.
750,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,- I'll go tally the votes.
751,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final,"
752,00:36:36.70,00:36:36.70,the person will be asked to leave
753,00:36:38.03,00:36:38.03,the Tribal Council area immediately.
754,00:36:39.93,00:36:39.93,I'll read the votes.
755,00:36:45.03,00:36:45.03,First vote...
756,00:36:48.57,00:36:48.57,Lindsey.
757,00:36:54.37,00:36:54.37,Lindsey.
758,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,Carl.
759,00:37:06.07,00:37:06.07,Doc Carl.
760,00:37:08.53,00:37:08.53,"That's two votes Carl, two votes Lindsey."
761,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,"Dr. B, that's Carl."
762,00:37:20.53,00:37:20.53,Carl.
763,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,"Four votes Carl, two votes Lindsey."
764,00:37:29.20,00:37:29.20,"Four votes Carl, three votes Lindsey."
765,00:37:33.07,00:37:33.07,Last vote.
766,00:37:37.60,00:37:37.60,We have a tie.
767,00:37:43.37,00:37:43.37,"Okay, so this is what's going to happen."
768,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"Carl, Lindsey, you guys are both going to have a chance to plead"
769,00:37:48.77,00:37:48.77,your case to your tribe as to why you should stay.
770,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,Why you shouldn't be voted out.
771,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,"And then we're going to revote, voting for either Lindsey or"
772,00:37:57.40,00:37:57.40,Carl-- you two won't vote.
773,00:37:59.27,00:37:59.27,"Carl, state your case."
774,00:38:00.80,00:38:00.80,"- From day one, I told you this is what you get-- I work hard,"
775,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,I maintained a sensibility of trying to make you people have
776,00:38:08.27,00:38:08.27,"water, fire, I've worked my tail off."
777,00:38:11.10,00:38:11.10,I don't think anybody here can
778,00:38:12.40,00:38:12.40,sit here and look me in the eye and say I've slacked.
779,00:38:14.23,00:38:14.23,"I'm a man of honor, I gave you my word, I've worked hard,"
780,00:38:16.93,00:38:16.93,and I think I'm a valuable asset to this tribe.
781,00:38:19.07,00:38:19.07,That's all I have to say.
782,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,- Lindsey.
783,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40,"- I'm not the most domestic person around, I don't know how"
784,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83,"to cook the mush yet, you know, I don't know how to maintain"
785,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40,"a fire that well, but I'm learning, and I'm willing to"
786,00:38:29.30,00:38:29.30,"learn and I put in my work when I need to, and at the challenges"
787,00:38:32.57,00:38:32.57,nobody can stop me.
788,00:38:34.17,00:38:34.17,"Carl has made it really clear that he's very successful,"
789,00:38:37.20,00:38:37.20,"he has a lot of money, he's really happy in his life,"
790,00:38:39.97,00:38:39.97,"and it's a game for money, and you don't need it."
791,00:38:44.37,00:38:44.37,- (Probst) Okay.
792,00:38:45.57,00:38:45.57,"Kim, you're first, I'm going to ask you"
793,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,to take this back up with you.
794,00:39:10.73,00:39:10.73,I'll go tally the votes.
795,00:39:20.87,00:39:20.87,Same rules apply on the re-vote.
796,00:39:23.07,00:39:23.07,"Once they're read, the decision's final,"
797,00:39:24.77,00:39:24.77,person voted out will be asked to leave
798,00:39:26.50,00:39:26.50,the Tribal Council area immediately.
799,00:39:29.33,00:39:29.33,"First vote, Carl."
800,00:39:37.50,00:39:37.50,Lindsey.
801,00:39:42.60,00:39:42.60,Carl.
802,00:39:46.80,00:39:46.80,Lindsey.
803,00:39:53.00,00:39:53.00,Carl.
804,00:39:54.63,00:39:54.63,"Three votes Carl, two votes Lindsey."
805,00:39:56.97,00:39:56.97,Deciding vote.

807,00:40:08.43,00:40:08.43,"Obviously you guys are deadlocked,"

810,00:40:13.73,00:40:13.73,"Carl, I need you first to switch seats with Teresa."
811,00:40:17.43,00:40:17.43,You guys were all given a copy
812,00:40:19.30,00:40:19.30,"of the Bush Survival Guide, right?"
813,00:40:21.83,00:40:21.83,You're going to answer a series of questions based on
814,00:40:24.60,00:40:24.60,information in the survival guide.
815,00:40:26.80,00:40:26.80,"First time one of you misses and the other doesn't, you're out."
816,00:40:30.33,00:40:30.33,Clear?
817,00:40:33.03,00:40:33.03,I'll give you each a pad to write on... and a pen.
818,00:40:40.80,00:40:40.80,First question.
819,00:40:41.90,00:40:41.90,True or false.

830,00:41:14.73,00:41:14.73,"Lindsey says A, Carl says B."
831,00:41:17.50,00:41:17.50,"Correct answer is C, worm infestation."
832,00:41:20.07,00:41:20.07,- We missed that one.
833,00:41:22.47,00:41:22.47,- (Probst) We move on.

837,00:41:31.80,00:41:31.80,It's true.
838,00:41:32.90,00:41:32.90,- Damn it!
839,00:41:33.97,00:41:33.97,I knew that.

846,00:41:54.60,00:41:54.60,"- Sorry, guys."
847,00:42:01.43,00:42:01.43,"- (Probst) Carl, the tribe has spoken."

850,00:42:18.73,00:42:18.73,and some regrouping to do.
851,00:42:20.43,00:42:20.43,"Take your torches back to camp, I'll see you tomorrow."
852,00:42:41.83,00:42:41.83,- (Probst) Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
853,00:42:47.90,00:42:47.90,Next time on Survivor...
854,00:42:49.67,00:42:49.67,"- Don't underestimate me, people."
855,00:42:51.60,00:42:51.60,"- At Samburu, the generation gap"
856,00:42:53.83,00:42:53.83,continues to fracture the tribe.
857,00:42:55.57,00:42:55.57,- Thank you!
858,00:42:56.80,00:42:56.80,- And Boran comes face to face
859,00:42:58.53,00:42:58.53,with one of their worst nightmares.
860,00:43:00.30,00:43:00.30,- Everybody hold up just a little.
861,00:43:02.63,00:43:02.63,"- We don't mess with this, you guys, you know?"
862,00:43:04.53,00:43:04.53,(grunting)
863,00:43:05.57,00:43:05.57,- They're bad-tempered.
864,00:43:12.77,00:43:12.77,"- Unfortunately, our tribe... there was a split,"
865,00:43:15.10,00:43:15.10,and it was an obvious split-- it was a generation gap.
866,00:43:18.30,00:43:18.30,We had four people who were in their 40s and have a sense of
867,00:43:20.43,00:43:20.43,"responsibility, and then you had four people"
868,00:43:22.77,00:43:22.77,who are confused in their lives.
869,00:43:24.20,00:43:24.20,It's kind of sad.
870,00:43:25.40,00:43:25.40,I'm kind of worried about that generation.
871,00:43:26.90,00:43:26.90,"Maybe they outwitted me, in that sense of sportsmanship,"
872,00:43:30.67,00:43:30.67,but I have no regrets.
