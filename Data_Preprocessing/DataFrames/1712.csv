3,00:00:06.25,00:00:06.25,">> Obviously, Bob and I know that our numbers are up."
4,00:00:09.08,00:00:09.08,">> PROBST: Outnumbered five to two, Bob and Corinne hatched a"
5,00:00:11.96,00:00:11.96,plan. Step one: Bob made another fake
6,00:00:15.25,00:00:15.25,hidden immunity idol. >> That would fool me.
7,00:00:17.83,00:00:17.83,">> PROBST: In fact, it looked almost as good as the real idol"
8,00:00:20.50,00:00:20.50,Sugar has had for most of the game.
9,00:00:22.33,00:00:22.33,>> Thank God. >> PROBST: Step two: Corinne
10,00:00:25.04,00:00:25.04,told Kenny she had an idol and convinced him to flip.
11,00:00:27.62,00:00:27.62,>> Who are you guys gonna take out?
12,00:00:29.54,00:00:29.54,>> We're taking out Matty. >> PROBST: Step three: Bob
13,00:00:31.58,00:00:31.58,"showed the idol to Crystal, and together, they also agreed to"
14,00:00:34.21,00:00:34.21,vote out Matty. Then Kenny changed the plan by
15,00:00:40.58,00:00:40.58,ordering Crystal to vote for Corinne.
16,00:00:42.38,00:00:42.38,>> You have to vote for Corinne. >> Okay.
17,00:00:49.92,00:00:49.92,">> If this plan works out, I'll be the biggest strategist in"
18,00:00:52.17,00:00:52.17,Survivor history. >> PROBST: Kenny's new plan
19,00:00:53.58,00:00:53.58,"hinged on Corinne playing the idol, but she couldn't because"
20,00:00:56.50,00:00:56.50,it was fake. So Corinne got the boot.
21,00:01:00.46,00:01:00.46,Matty received three votes and was fuming.
22,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,Will Kenny's latest strategic move come back to bite him?
23,00:01:06.46,00:01:06.46,Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
24,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,>> The vote tonight was four votes for Corinne and three
25,00:01:27.75,00:01:27.75,votes for me. And I believe that tonight I got
26,00:01:30.08,00:01:30.08,"a vote from Kenny, and he wants me out of the game."
27,00:01:32.54,00:01:32.54,You were voting out Corinne tonight.
28,00:01:34.67,00:01:34.67,Why did you put down my name? >> Because they had the immunity
29,00:01:36.46,00:01:36.46,idol. I thought it was the real one.
30,00:01:38.58,00:01:38.58,">> Don't lie, bro. That's what you're doing."
31,00:01:41.17,00:01:41.17,">> Once I got back from camp, Matty was super mad at me."
32,00:01:43.88,00:01:43.88,"I voted for him, and that was strategically a move to gain me"
33,00:01:47.04,00:01:47.04,jury votes in the final three. I have been calling the shots
34,00:01:50.25,00:01:50.25,"since day one out here, you know?"
35,00:01:52.25,00:01:52.25,I am the mastermind behind everything going on.
36,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,"Both of you, just listen to my story."
37,00:01:57.17,00:01:57.17,">> I started getting an earload of crap from Kenny, you know,"
38,00:01:59.79,00:01:59.79,"why he did what he did, and I didn't even want to hear it from"
39,00:02:03.12,00:02:03.12,"him, you know? Don't lie, Kenny."
40,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,Kenny's playing a game. He's a mastermind.
41,00:02:07.38,00:02:07.38,And I'm on to him. >> Don't worry. Don't worry.
42,00:02:14.04,00:02:14.04,"I really like Matty, but he's a huge physical threat."
43,00:02:17.46,00:02:17.46,"I have a strong alliance with Kenny and Crystal, and that's"
44,00:02:20.25,00:02:20.25,the best alliance I've had in the whole entire game.
45,00:02:25.12,00:02:25.12,">> He's put your name down. >> Yeah, exactly."
46,00:02:27.67,00:02:27.67,And I still ain't put his name down yet.
47,00:02:30.04,00:02:30.04,"I owe him, and I'm letting both y'all know, I owe him."
48,00:02:33.21,00:02:33.21,I'm really regretting not writing Matty's name down
49,00:02:35.71,00:02:35.71,"tonight, which is probably the stupidest move that I've made in"
50,00:02:39.38,00:02:39.38,"this game so far. Hopefully, Matty doesn't win"
51,00:02:42.29,00:02:42.29,"immunity at the next challenge, and Matty needs to go."

56,00:03:56.38,00:03:56.38,It's fake. >> So you guys did lie to me.
57,00:04:02.17,00:04:02.17,And now my game is messed up. >> I feel horrible about pulling
58,00:04:08.54,00:04:08.54,"Kenny in... uh, who's now, he's in a real predicament, and it's"
59,00:04:12.62,00:04:12.62,my fault. >> Okay. Are you... are you
60,00:04:25.75,00:04:25.75,"genuinely saying that, or are you just lying to me again?"
61,00:04:32.21,00:04:32.21,>> Bob offered to give me the immunity necklace.
62,00:04:35.12,00:04:35.12,I made him feel sorry for me. This is a huge power play.
63,00:04:38.96,00:04:38.96,">> Um, I feel horrible about it. I made Kenny a promise that I"
64,00:04:42.83,00:04:42.83,"wouldn't play him as a fool and that I owe him something, and I"
65,00:04:45.58,00:04:45.58,"want to be, you know, a man of my word."

77,00:05:48.71,00:05:48.71,"You will then enjoy a nice meal, a good night's sleep, with a bed"
78,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,and a shower. You'll return to camp in the

86,00:06:30.38,00:06:30.38,first. Matty right behind.
87,00:06:36.38,00:06:36.38,Bob now working on his. Matty quickly has his ball and
88,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,"is heading back. Kenny has his first ball,"
89,00:06:47.17,00:06:47.17,heading back. Bob's heading back.
90,00:06:51.83,00:06:51.83,"Once you get it in the net, head back out and do it again."
91,00:06:59.38,00:06:59.38,"Bob now back, taking a shot. Got to get it in the net before"
92,00:07:03.17,00:07:03.17,you can head back out. Matty has his first ball in.
93,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,Heading back out. Kenny has his first ball in.
94,00:07:13.42,00:07:13.42,Kenny heading back out. >> Damn!

97,00:07:26.58,00:07:26.58,ball. All three guys have hit their
98,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,shots. The women have yet to make one.
99,00:07:32.17,00:07:32.17,>> Damn! >> PROBST: Matty taking aim.
100,00:07:38.50,00:07:38.50,Just misses. Kenny now back with his second

114,00:09:00.08,00:09:00.08,"Your reward is pretty nice. Do a little gorilla watching,"
115,00:09:03.71,00:09:03.71,"nice meal, good night's sleep in a bed."
116,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,An adventure like this is always more fun if you can share it.
117,00:09:10.58,00:09:10.58,Choose one person to go with you on this reward.
118,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,"Crystal. >> Oh, thank you!"
119,00:09:20.21,00:09:20.21,>> PROBST: Crystal gonna join Bob for a nice reward.
120,00:09:23.88,00:09:23.88,Two's fun; three's a party. Pick one other person to go with
121,00:09:26.92,00:09:26.92,you. >> Kenny.
122,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,">> PROBST: Without hesitating, Bob chooses Kenny."
123,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,">> The way I'm playing the game right now is, I need Crystal and"
124,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,Kenny to work with me. Because I am trying to play for
125,00:09:39.21,00:09:39.21,"all the marbles in the pot. >> PROBST: All right, Bob, one"
126,00:09:42.29,00:09:42.29,more big decision. You have three people left.
127,00:09:44.92,00:09:44.92,One of them is going to Exile Island.
128,00:09:47.50,00:09:47.50,>> Miss Q can go. Susie Q.
129,00:09:49.92,00:09:49.92,">> PROBST: Susie Q, Exile Island awaits you."
130,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,Grab your stuff. >> I'm right here.
131,00:09:54.50,00:09:54.50,>> PROBST: You will return in time for the next immunity
132,00:09:56.62,00:09:56.62,challenge. Straight out this way.
133,00:09:58.58,00:09:58.58,"(indistinct talking) Sugar, Matty, got nothing for"
134,00:10:01.54,00:10:01.54,you. Grab your stuff.
135,00:10:03.88,00:10:03.88,Head back to camp. >> Bye. Have fun.
136,00:10:05.62,00:10:05.62,">> Bye, guys. >> Crystal and Kenny drive me"
137,00:10:08.79,00:10:08.79,nuts. They've spent way too long in
138,00:10:11.08,00:10:11.08,this game. My goal with Sugar is to get her
139,00:10:13.62,00:10:13.62,to align with me and vote Kenny and Crystal out.
140,00:10:17.17,00:10:17.17,">> PROBST: Bob, Crystal, Kenny, helicopter coming in."
141,00:10:19.42,00:10:19.42,Have a great time. Head on out.

144,00:10:47.12,00:10:47.12,"time in a helicopter, and, yeah, I was enjoying it."
145,00:10:49.54,00:10:49.54,Looking down you see nothing but pure jungle and savanna.
146,00:10:53.92,00:10:53.92,It's-it's... it really is Eden out here.
147,00:11:03.92,00:11:03.92,"(speaking in native language) >> Oh, my God."
148,00:11:08.58,00:11:08.58,">> We walk into this hut and the first thing, of course, we see"
149,00:11:12.62,00:11:12.62,"on the table is food. You have your fresh mango, your"

151,00:11:21.62,00:11:21.62,"tomatoes. >> Ooh, ooh!"
152,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,">> These are good. >> Thank you, guys, for joining"
153,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,me. >> Thank you.
154,00:11:29.25,00:11:29.25,>> Thank you. >> Cheers.
155,00:11:33.12,00:11:33.12,>> I wish I could have brought everybody.
156,00:11:39.62,00:11:39.62,">> I think if Matty doesn't win tomorrow, you know, that would"
157,00:11:43.21,00:11:43.21,be a good thing. >> I hope the next move is
158,00:11:45.12,00:11:45.12,"Matty because if it's not Matty, it's going to be one of"
159,00:11:47.88,00:11:47.88,us. >> Can we get Sugar on board
160,00:11:50.71,00:11:50.71,with that? It would be nice if we could
161,00:11:53.62,00:11:53.62,"take Matty out, and it's nice that I think I have won the"
162,00:11:58.79,00:11:58.79,confidence of Crystal and Kenny. And I think my integrity has
163,00:12:02.50,00:12:02.50,stepped in here and is working. Kenny believes I will give him
164,00:12:05.42,00:12:05.42,"the immunity if I win it, and the reason he believes me, I"
165,00:12:08.12,00:12:08.12,"think, is, because I do have integrity."
166,00:12:10.21,00:12:10.21,">> I mean, if you win immunity, I could take a risk."
167,00:12:14.21,00:12:14.21,You don't have to give it to me the first time.
168,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,But... >> If I don't give it to you
169,00:12:20.58,00:12:20.58,"the first time, I'm not a man of my word, right?"
170,00:12:23.12,00:12:23.12,">> Yeah, that's true. >> Uh, but if you want to..."
171,00:12:27.08,00:12:27.08,You want to analyze and get me off the hook.
172,00:12:29.12,00:12:29.12,"Originally, I told you, I would give it to you right away."
173,00:12:31.12,00:12:31.12,I think the best thing is for you to make the decision.
174,00:12:33.62,00:12:33.62,">> Yeah, and I'll be like, ""I think you should keep it"
175,00:12:36.42,00:12:36.42,"tonight, Bob."" Or I'll say, ""I think that I'm"
176,00:12:39.50,00:12:39.50,"in danger."" >> This is the plan: at the"
177,00:12:42.96,00:12:42.96,"next Tribal, I'll be wearing the necklace I haven't won yet,"
178,00:12:46.92,00:12:46.92,"and if Kenny feels that he needs it, and if he wants it,"
179,00:12:51.08,00:12:51.08,I will give it to him. If he thinks it's better off
180,00:12:53.54,00:12:53.54,"protecting me, he'll say, ""No, keep it."""
181,00:12:56.75,00:12:56.75,>> I think all of us look so dirty.
182,00:12:59.21,00:12:59.21,I hope they're going to let us take a shower and get cleaned
183,00:13:02.00,00:13:02.00,up before we go. >> See the gorillas?
184,00:13:04.21,00:13:04.21,>> Mmm. >> I'm so excited.
185,00:13:08.92,00:13:08.92,To take a shower was invigorating.
186,00:13:12.08,00:13:12.08,We had soap and towels and washcloths.
187,00:13:15.21,00:13:15.21,"And put on some fresh clothes, and we were just like, ""Wow,"
188,00:13:18.29,00:13:18.29,"you smell so good."" >> Oh, man!"
189,00:13:21.75,00:13:21.75,">> It was pretty cool. >> Wow, Bob."
190,00:13:24.21,00:13:24.21,>> A big improvement. >> I know.
191,00:13:26.25,00:13:26.25,">> The green does kind of look good on you, too."
192,00:13:28.00,00:13:28.00,>> It does. >> It's even got pockets.
193,00:13:32.92,00:13:32.92,">> Hey, guys. >> Hi."
194,00:13:34.21,00:13:34.21,">> Welcome to Mbenge, the Gorilla Project."
195,00:13:37.79,00:13:37.79,>> Nice to meet you. I'm Bob. 
196,00:13:39.04,00:13:39.04,>> Nice to meet you. >> Nice to meet you.
197,00:13:40.75,00:13:40.75,">> After we cleaned up, some rangers came in and spoke to us"
198,00:13:43.25,00:13:43.25,about the Gorilla Project. It's called Africa's Eden.
199,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,">> So, we're a sanctuary and a rehabilitation center."
200,00:13:53.21,00:13:53.21,">> So, the rangers explained everything about gorillas."
201,00:13:57.17,00:13:57.17,They said they were really in danger because of people
202,00:13:59.08,00:13:59.08,"poaching them in Africa, getting gorilla meat, and what's left"
203,00:14:02.08,00:14:02.08,"is baby orphaned gorillas, and they have nowhere to go."
204,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,">> We walked down to an observation platform, and we"
205,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,"sat there for quite some time, just sort of getting them used"
206,00:14:16.33,00:14:16.33,"to us. And then Mbakai, the large"
207,00:14:30.17,00:14:30.17,"silverback gorilla, stepped out. His head is enormous."
208,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,We were 25 feet from him. He was right there.
209,00:14:43.96,00:14:43.96,"I'm not usually spiritual, but there was a feeling like there"
210,00:14:48.71,00:14:48.71,"was a connection between these great apes and myself, how they"
211,00:14:54.54,00:14:54.54,"were looking at us, and we were looking at them."
212,00:14:57.08,00:14:57.08,And it just... It did sort of rock my soul.
213,00:15:24.04,00:15:24.04,">> Coming to Exile, I know that Sugar has the idol, so I went"
214,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,ahead and took my chances and just enjoyed the comfort and the
215,00:15:30.71,00:15:30.71,fruit just to get away from the whole game.
216,00:15:38.08,00:15:38.08,People back at Nobag have  no idea what they're missing.
217,00:15:41.58,00:15:41.58,"It was pretty easy choosing the comfort, actually."
218,00:15:44.58,00:15:44.58,But the one great thing about being at Exile is it takes you
219,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,"away from the game. You can just step away and say,"
220,00:15:50.88,00:15:50.88,"""I don't have to think about anything right now."""
221,00:15:53.00,00:15:53.00,"I think I'm going to have to change it from ""Sugar Shack"" to"
222,00:15:55.79,00:15:55.79,"""Susie Shack."" >> Well, we went on a cool"
223,00:16:14.88,00:16:14.88,reward and they didn't get to do anything.
224,00:16:17.08,00:16:17.08,>> I've been gunning for Crystal and Kenny this entire
225,00:16:19.25,00:16:19.25,game. >> Really?
226,00:16:20.92,00:16:20.92,">> Yeah, really. >> Well, I'll tell you what."
227,00:16:23.83,00:16:23.83,You better win that thing tomorrow because you're the
228,00:16:26.04,00:16:26.04,biggest threat now. I wouldn't want to be Matty
229,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,right now because he knows he's next.
230,00:16:30.88,00:16:30.88,"If it's not Bob, who is it? In my alliance with Kenny and"
231,00:16:34.96,00:16:34.96,Crystal... >> It is your alliance.
232,00:16:36.08,00:16:36.08,>> It's me and Kenny and Crystal.
233,00:16:38.00,00:16:38.00,>> So now you're choosing them as your alliance?
234,00:16:40.25,00:16:40.25,Brilliant thinking. You're the evil three.
235,00:16:42.79,00:16:42.79,">> We're not the evil three, dude."
236,00:16:44.25,00:16:44.25,">> I don't know, man. >> It's mostly with me and"
237,00:16:46.00,00:16:46.00,"Kenny. Unless, you know, he could"
238,00:16:47.92,00:16:47.92,totally be taking me for a ride. >> He is taking you for a ride
239,00:16:50.29,00:16:50.29,because his main alliance is Crystal.
240,00:16:52.00,00:16:52.00,"I know for 1,000%.  >> I'm sure Kenny is probably"
241,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,"lying to me, but Matty is the stronger physical threat, so"
242,00:16:58.46,00:16:58.46,I don't know who to believe. I don't know who to turn to.
243,00:17:01.92,00:17:01.92,I'm pretty sure you and Bob will win.
244,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,">> Well, you have the idol. >> Nobody's going to vote for"
245,00:17:11.17,00:17:11.17,you. >> We'll see.
246,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,">> Not with having the idol. >> Oh, Matty."
247,00:17:17.33,00:17:17.33,I'm certainly not going to give Matty my idol.
248,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,"Screw that. At this point, I'm using my"
249,00:17:21.25,00:17:21.25,idol to make sure I'm in the final five.
250,00:17:23.38,00:17:23.38,">> If Bob takes the next immunity challenge, they're"
251,00:17:25.17,00:17:25.17,voting for me. >> I would say that's accurate.
252,00:17:27.17,00:17:27.17,>> My status now is I'm basically on my own.
253,00:17:30.75,00:17:30.75,"And I'm not getting any help from anybody, and if I don't win"
254,00:17:33.50,00:17:33.50,"the next immunity challenge, I think I'm packing up my bags"
255,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,and going home. >> Yay!
256,00:17:59.42,00:17:59.42,Was it the best ever? >> Yes.
257,00:18:01.38,00:18:01.38,">> All right, tell us about it. >> Look at this."
258,00:18:03.25,00:18:03.25,>> Your shirt is clean? >> Yes.
259,00:18:05.42,00:18:05.42,">> Oh, my God. Let me wear it. "
260,00:18:08.08,00:18:08.08,>> This is... The green is a lot.
261,00:18:09.79,00:18:09.79,">> It's cool that Bob went on the experience, but he chose"
262,00:18:12.29,00:18:12.29,"Kenny and Crystal, which was so annoying and frustrating to"
263,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,me because those two just... I don't know. 
264,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,I'm having a hard time with those two still.
265,00:18:22.38,00:18:22.38,">> I can feel it, Matty, that you're, like, mad at me."
266,00:18:24.50,00:18:24.50,"So, I don't know why you're trying to hide it."
267,00:18:26.04,00:18:26.04,>> I never voted for you. You said we were going to the
268,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"end together, Kenny. >> There's no reason to be"
269,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,upset. >> I have good reason.
270,00:18:31.75,00:18:31.75,My name was written down three times here.
271,00:18:33.12,00:18:33.12,">> My name's been written down eight, one of them by you."
272,00:18:35.67,00:18:35.67,"You still, to this day, say ""Crystal, thank you for not"
273,00:18:37.38,00:18:37.38,"writing my name down."" >> My name has been written"
274,00:18:39.67,00:18:39.67,down seven times already. >> I don't care.
275,00:18:42.12,00:18:42.12,">> Think about that. >> Hey, Kenny, don't talk about"
276,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,"it anymore, okay, bro? >> No, I'm mad."
277,00:18:48.04,00:18:48.04,Matty is super paranoid. Ever since his name was written
278,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,down. It was a strategic move on my
279,00:18:52.29,00:18:52.29,"part, but... It's a game."
280,00:18:54.00,00:18:54.00,People write down names. >> Let him be scared.
281,00:18:56.21,00:18:56.21,Karma's a bitch in this game. Right now I'm throwing the stink
282,00:18:59.04,00:18:59.04,"on Matty, so everybody else can smell it and write his name"
283,00:19:01.46,00:19:01.46,down. >> Mm-hmm.
284,00:19:13.92,00:19:13.92,>> Because you and Sue are like that.
285,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,>> I am like that with Sue. I like Sue.
286,00:19:18.58,00:19:18.58,I like spending time with Sue out here.
287,00:19:20.17,00:19:20.17,I don't trust her. >> You can look me in the eye
288,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33,and say you don't trust Sue. >> I don't trust Sue.
289,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,>> You're lying. >> What?
290,00:19:27.08,00:19:27.08,">> You've changed, and it's not for the good."
291,00:19:29.29,00:19:29.29,"But if you (blip) me and Kenny over, karma is a bitch."
292,00:19:30.92,00:19:30.92,>> Why are you getting mad at me?
293,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,I didn't do anything. >> Because me and Kenny have
294,00:19:33.29,00:19:33.29,been there for you from day one.
295,00:19:34.88,00:19:34.88,>> What do you mean? What do you want from me?
296,00:19:36.50,00:19:36.50,>> I don't want anything from you.
297,00:19:38.08,00:19:38.08,I don't want anything from you. >> I have no idea what's
298,00:19:41.58,00:19:41.58,happening right now. Crystal is going off on Matty
299,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,"for no reason, and I've already seen Kenny go off on Matty, and"
300,00:19:47.50,00:19:47.50,Matty doesn't deserve to be yelled at.
301,00:19:52.46,00:19:52.46,">> What am I doing wrong, Crystal?"
302,00:19:54.21,00:19:54.21,>> Keep doing what you're doing. But where did this come from?
303,00:19:56.58,00:19:56.58,">> Matty is right, I think, that Crystal and Kenny have"
304,00:19:59.21,00:19:59.21,been in this together from the beginning and they just take
305,00:20:01.79,00:20:01.79,"out whoever they want. Kenny acts like he's this weak,"
306,00:20:04.50,00:20:04.50,"little meager guy, and he spins all these lies, and Crystal is"
307,00:20:09.21,00:20:09.21,just a big bully. This is the thing.
308,00:20:12.58,00:20:12.58,They're not good people. I'm starting to see that about
309,00:20:15.54,00:20:15.54,"Kenny, and I know that about Crystal."
310,00:20:19.50,00:20:19.50,">> Do you really, or you just... I don't know what's going on."
311,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,">> I don't, either, but now I see that they're not, like..."
312,00:20:25.58,00:20:25.58,Why would they kick you when you're down?
313,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,It feels like they're just going off on you when you know
314,00:20:30.71,00:20:30.71,you're going. But you're not going.
315,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,>> Why don't I just... >> You're not going to go.
316,00:20:39.88,00:20:39.88,"Okay? >> Well, what do we do?"
317,00:20:42.79,00:20:42.79,">> You, me, Bob, and Sue. I have to talk to Bob because"
318,00:20:46.42,00:20:46.42,I know Bob better than anybody else.
319,00:20:48.08,00:20:48.08,"At this point. >> Sugar, are you truthful?"
320,00:20:51.71,00:20:51.71,>> I am not... >> If Sugar really is telling
321,00:20:54.42,00:20:54.42,"me the truth, I have hope, and I could play this game."
322,00:20:59.25,00:20:59.25,"I might have to go to the end with Bob, and Bob will"
323,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,"dominate, but least good will prevail."
324,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,>> It's either me and you guys or you guys and Sue.
325,00:21:05.75,00:21:05.75,">> Who do we take out first, then, if you're being serious?"
326,00:21:07.21,00:21:07.21,>> Crystal. Crystal goes first.
327,00:21:10.21,00:21:10.21,>> This is just intense. I'm just praying that I can
328,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,find the strength to... finish.
329,00:21:28.04,00:21:28.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Susie,"
330,00:21:43.08,00:21:43.08,returning from Exile Island. >> It was a good time.
331,00:21:49.12,00:21:49.12,It was a good time. >> PROBST: Welcome back.
332,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: You guys ready to
333,00:21:52.25,00:21:52.25,get to today's immunity challenge?
334,00:21:53.71,00:21:53.71,>> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first.
335,00:21:54.79,00:21:54.79,"Bob, I will take back the necklace."
336,00:21:58.50,00:21:58.50,"Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up"
337,00:22:04.58,00:22:04.58,"for grabs. For today's challenge, on my"
338,00:22:08.75,00:22:08.75,"""go,"" you will study the features of a Gabonese mask."
339,00:22:12.08,00:22:12.08,You will then grab a bag of mask pieces and make your way
340,00:22:15.67,00:22:15.67,through a series of obstacles to a station where you will
341,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,find a second blank mask. You will then use those pieces
342,00:22:22.46,00:22:22.46,to fill in the missing features. One more thing: you will be
343,00:22:26.92,00:22:26.92,blindfolded. First person to collect all
344,00:22:30.88,00:22:30.88,three bags and successfully recreate the mask wins
345,00:22:34.75,00:22:34.75,"immunity-- guaranteed a one in what, Kenny?"
346,00:22:38.29,00:22:38.29,>> One in five chance of winning a million dollars.
347,00:22:41.29,00:22:41.29,">> PROBST: There you go. Losers, Tribal Council, where"
348,00:22:44.12,00:22:44.12,somebody will be voted out of this game.
349,00:22:46.75,00:22:46.75,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
350,00:22:48.25,00:22:48.25,"All right, we'll get started. Here we go."
351,00:22:55.33,00:22:55.33,"Other side, Sugar, other side. Here we go."
352,00:22:59.08,00:22:59.08,For immunity. Survivors ready?
353,00:23:03.04,00:23:03.04,Go! You will use your hands to study
354,00:23:07.83,00:23:07.83,"that mask. Or, if you decide to, you can"
355,00:23:10.92,00:23:10.92,head out right away. It is up to you.
356,00:23:20.38,00:23:20.38,"Matty quickly out to a lead. Matty at his station first, got"
357,00:23:30.33,00:23:30.33,"his first bag, and he's heading back."
358,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,Not going to work on it one bag at a time.
359,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,Kenny back with his first bag of pieces.
360,00:23:37.58,00:23:37.58,"Bob is back. Sugar, Bob, Kenny are all going"
361,00:23:41.33,00:23:41.33,to start working on recreating the mask.
362,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,Matty's going to go get all of his pieces at once.
363,00:23:49.08,00:23:49.08,Crystal. >> Yes?
364,00:23:50.29,00:23:50.29,>> PROBST: You are off the course.
365,00:23:51.54,00:23:51.54,">> Oh, shoot. >> PROBST: You are in the wrong"

367,00:23:55.21,00:23:55.21,You got to get back on the course and find your lane.
368,00:24:00.33,00:24:00.33,"Matty coming back with his second bag of pieces, while"
369,00:24:03.46,00:24:03.46,"Kenny, Bob, Sugar, and Susie start working with their first"

372,00:24:17.29,00:24:17.29,Matty heading back for his third and final bag.
373,00:24:20.38,00:24:20.38,"Bob is heading back, looking for his second bag."
374,00:24:23.75,00:24:23.75,Crystal once again off the course.
375,00:24:26.29,00:24:26.29,Crystal back on the course. Matty coming back with that
376,00:24:29.75,00:24:29.75,third bag. Everybody else so close and
377,00:24:33.04,00:24:33.04,yet so far away when you cannot see.
378,00:24:36.08,00:24:36.08,Matty now back with all three bags of the facial features.
379,00:24:40.08,00:24:40.08,Matty now going to start working on his mask.
380,00:24:42.75,00:24:42.75,"Kenny heading back now, looking for that second bag."
381,00:24:45.38,00:24:45.38,"Bob is back with his second bag. Crystal, miraculously, is"
382,00:24:50.08,00:24:50.08,almost there. Crystal has arrived with her
383,00:24:53.79,00:24:53.79,first bag. Kenny takes a header into a
384,00:24:58.29,00:24:58.29,pole. Even the king can get injured
385,00:25:00.62,00:25:00.62,in this challenge. Everybody working on their mask
386,00:25:04.42,00:25:04.42,now. Bob now heading back for his
387,00:25:08.54,00:25:08.54,third and final bag. Susie heading back for her
388,00:25:11.12,00:25:11.12,"second bag. (Bob groans, chuckles)"
389,00:25:16.12,00:25:16.12,Bob took a header into a station.
390,00:25:18.21,00:25:18.21,Susie is off the course. Bob heading back with that
391,00:25:23.58,00:25:23.58,third and final bag. Matty going to head back to
392,00:25:34.12,00:25:34.12,"check his mask again, while Bob is back with that third and"
393,00:25:38.25,00:25:38.25,final bag. >> I think I have it.
394,00:25:45.96,00:25:45.96,>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it. Bob does not have it.
395,00:25:53.46,00:25:53.46,Matty now coming back after checking that mask.
396,00:25:57.71,00:25:57.71,Bob making a lot of changes. Kenny still working on his mask.
397,00:26:01.58,00:26:01.58,"He has all three bags. The question now is, ""Do I have"
398,00:26:05.08,00:26:05.08,"the right pieces?"" Crystal not giving up,"
399,00:26:09.08,00:26:09.08,continues to fight in this challenge.
400,00:26:11.67,00:26:11.67,"Susie trying to find the course. >> I think I have it, Jeff."
401,00:26:19.67,00:26:19.67,>> PROBST: Kenny thinks he has it.
402,00:26:22.54,00:26:22.54,Kenny is wrong. Kenny going to head back to
403,00:26:25.50,00:26:25.50,check his mask again. Matty very close.
404,00:26:29.25,00:26:29.25,Bob is almost there. Big immunity on the line.
405,00:26:35.75,00:26:35.75,>> I'll just try that. >> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.
406,00:26:39.04,00:26:39.04,Bob is right! Bob wins immunity!
407,00:26:43.42,00:26:43.42,Four straight challenges. >> Wow.
408,00:26:51.33,00:26:51.33,">> PROBST: Bob, come on over. Once again, immunity is yours."
409,00:26:55.83,00:26:55.83,"Turn around, brother. Once again, Bob is safe at"
410,00:26:59.58,00:26:59.58,"Tribal Council. After 36 long days, Tribal"
411,00:27:04.00,00:27:04.00,Council tonight. One of you will be going home.
412,00:27:06.08,00:27:06.08,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
413,00:27:07.75,00:27:07.75,I will see you at Tribal. >> Four challenges in a row.
414,00:27:11.00,00:27:11.00,I'm 57 years old. It felt real good.
415,00:27:13.46,00:27:13.46,Been a good run at four. I never would have guessed that.
416,00:27:17.29,00:27:17.29,>> Bob promised me that if he won the immunity necklace that
417,00:27:20.21,00:27:20.21,"he'll give it to me. Now, it's up to Bob, you know."
418,00:27:22.17,00:27:22.17,"Actions do speak louder than words, and I can only wait to"
419,00:27:25.04,00:27:25.04,see what he does tonight. >> I know you want to get rid
420,00:27:50.67,00:27:50.67,"of Matty. But we get rid of Matty tonight,"
421,00:27:53.96,00:27:53.96,there's a chance Bob lied to me and won't give me the necklace
422,00:27:56.75,00:27:56.75,next time. So I'm going to tell Bob to
423,00:27:58.62,00:27:58.62,give me the necklace tonight. And we got to vote for Bob.
424,00:28:01.17,00:28:01.17,">> Okay, sounds good. >> Is that okay?"
425,00:28:03.08,00:28:03.08,>> I'm cool with that. >> Who would've thought Bob
426,00:28:04.92,00:28:04.92,would be winning all these challenges?
427,00:28:06.29,00:28:06.29,But he has been. We should have got rid of him
428,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,"when we had the chance, but we kept him in because everybody"
429,00:28:10.38,00:28:10.38,hated Randy. And now we're paying for it.
430,00:28:13.04,00:28:13.04,He's too dangerous at this point.
431,00:28:15.08,00:28:15.08,None of us has the chance to make it to the final three.
432,00:28:17.58,00:28:17.58,">> Okay. In all honesty, I would like"
433,00:28:19.88,00:28:19.88,"to take out Matty, but if it's Bob's name we're going with"
434,00:28:23.08,00:28:23.08,"tonight, Bob it is. As long as it's not Crystal,"
435,00:28:26.04,00:28:26.04,I'm fine. >> Hmm?
436,00:28:35.08,00:28:35.08,Why? Why would you be scared?
437,00:28:39.21,00:28:39.21,">> I don't know. Bob made a deal with me, you"
438,00:28:41.46,00:28:41.46,know. He's going to give me that
439,00:28:42.92,00:28:42.92,"immunity necklace if he wins. If he doesn't, he'll look"
440,00:28:45.04,00:28:45.04,really bad in front of everybody.
441,00:28:46.71,00:28:46.71,"If he does, he'll look good in front of everybody, and he'll go"
442,00:28:49.50,00:28:49.50,home. So lose-lose situation for him.
443,00:28:55.12,00:28:55.12,>> Why would they blindside you? We're going to take Matty out.
444,00:29:03.00,00:29:03.00,Why would you feel nervous? >> 'Cause I'm with you.
445,00:29:05.17,00:29:05.17,"There might be the four still. >> Okay, okay."
446,00:29:07.88,00:29:07.88,We'll talk... we'll talk. We'll talk about it.
447,00:29:09.96,00:29:09.96,Let's find out who's voting for who?
448,00:29:24.75,00:29:24.75,">> What? >> Hey, guys."
449,00:29:47.42,00:29:47.42,>> Kenny has come up with this elaborate plan to hoax Bob out
450,00:29:51.46,00:29:51.46,of his necklace. If Bob were to give Kenny the
451,00:29:53.83,00:29:53.83,"necklace, then everybody would vote for Bob because they want"
452,00:29:56.17,00:29:56.17,to keep their five alliance. I don't want to be aligned with
453,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,all those guys. I want to be aligned with the
454,00:30:01.21,00:30:01.21,"good guys. Crystal and Kenny, I've been,"
455,00:30:08.38,00:30:08.38,"like, in an alliance with them. >> Mm-hmm."
456,00:30:10.58,00:30:10.58,">> But just something, something is really striking me weird"
457,00:30:14.83,00:30:14.83,"right now that, that I didn't feel before."
458,00:30:18.71,00:30:18.71,"And, um, they told me that if you give Kenny the, uh, the"
459,00:30:23.62,00:30:23.62,"necklace, then he's going to... they're going to blindside you."
460,00:30:26.08,00:30:26.08,"That's the plan. And, uh, see, I wouldn't know"
461,00:30:30.25,00:30:30.25,that unless they told me that. So... I think that you shouldn't
462,00:30:35.04,00:30:35.04,do everything that they say. I think we need to take them
463,00:30:40.42,00:30:40.42,"out. I mean, I just wanted to talk"
464,00:30:44.62,00:30:44.62,to you about it. You don't have to make any
465,00:30:46.38,00:30:46.38,decisions. You can vote for whoever you
466,00:30:48.04,00:30:48.04,want. >> So where's Susie stand in
467,00:30:49.58,00:30:49.58,all this? >> I-I really don't know what
468,00:30:52.71,00:30:52.71,Susie's doing. I'm sure she's going to vote
469,00:30:54.88,00:30:54.88,for whoever Matty votes for. And I think we should vote for
470,00:30:58.62,00:30:58.62,Crystal. >> Sugar said to me that it was
471,00:31:02.62,00:31:02.62,"a blindside coming, which is an interesting thing because she"
472,00:31:05.88,00:31:05.88,hasn't done anything to show me I can trust her.
473,00:31:08.00,00:31:08.00,She has not done anything that shows me I can't trust her.
474,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,"So I want to believe, but she's, um, she-she's playing the game."
475,00:31:23.04,00:31:23.04,>> I appreciate that. Um...
476,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,">> I mean, it's-it's a big decision for you, and I"
477,00:31:29.62,00:31:29.62,understand that. But I just want you to look out
478,00:31:31.62,00:31:31.62,for yourself. I will not vote for you.
479,00:31:36.21,00:31:36.21,"I know you're the biggest threat, but I don't care."
480,00:31:39.25,00:31:39.25,I just think the good guys should win in the end.
481,00:31:47.88,00:31:47.88,>> What are we going to do if he doesn't give me the idol?
482,00:31:51.12,00:31:51.12,">> I'm going home, obviously. >> Hmm?"
483,00:31:58.50,00:31:58.50,>> I think he might do it. >> Why? What happened?
484,00:32:00.88,00:32:00.88,">> I just talked to him for a little bit, and I was like..."
485,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,"I hate lying to Bob because I really, really like Bob."
486,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,But it is a game. I just told him that Kenny's
487,00:32:09.08,00:32:09.08,next. I think. We'll see.
488,00:32:19.54,00:32:19.54,">> Bob thinks that I'm on the outskirts with him, and, um,"
489,00:32:22.17,00:32:22.17,"I've made him think that. Hopefully, he will give me that"
490,00:32:25.21,00:32:25.21,"immunity necklace, and Bob goes home tonight."
491,00:32:27.42,00:32:27.42,"But if not, then Matty will be going home instead."
492,00:32:33.54,00:32:33.54,>> Yeah. >> I'm definitely playing my
493,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,idol at Tribal because it's my last day to do it.
494,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,"Maybe I should give it to Matty and save Matty, but I don't"
495,00:33:11.38,00:33:11.38,want anybody to blindside me. Just as long as Matty listens
496,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,"to me, and Bob knows to trust me, everything's going to be"
497,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,fine. >> PROBST: Now bring in
498,00:33:39.08,00:33:39.08,"the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, Randy..."
499,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"and Corinne, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
500,00:33:54.75,00:33:54.75,"So, Bob, let's start with you. Four challenges in a row."
501,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,There's no hiding; you're a legitimate threat in this game.
502,00:34:03.92,00:34:03.92,>> You hit the nail right on the head.
503,00:34:05.83,00:34:05.83,"It's a huge target on my back. And if I don't win, I could be"
504,00:34:09.75,00:34:09.75,"joining the jury. >> PROBST: Kenny, you start"
505,00:34:12.71,00:34:12.71,"seeing a guy like Bob bring it on strong, he could win his way"
506,00:34:16.58,00:34:16.58,"to the final Tribal Council. >> Yeah, he amazes me, you"
507,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,"know, for being as old as he is. He's strong."
508,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17,He's smart. He's agile.
509,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33,"He's, he's Bob. >> PROBST: Matty, when you see"
510,00:34:28.12,00:34:28.12,"Bob win challenge after challenge, what starts going"
511,00:34:31.21,00:34:31.21,"through your head? >> You know, if anybody is"
512,00:34:33.71,00:34:33.71,"going to dominate at this game, I'm really happy that it's this"
513,00:34:37.21,00:34:37.21,"man next to me, Bob, because it's a lot better him having"
514,00:34:40.38,00:34:40.38,that necklace around his neck than somebody of a little less
515,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,"caliber. >> PROBST: Susie, a lot going"
516,00:34:46.96,00:34:46.96,on these last few days. Hard to be away on Exile?
517,00:34:50.00,00:34:50.00,">> Yeah, when you're away like that and you come back into the"
518,00:34:52.50,00:34:52.50,"game, it's like, wow. You just miss bits and pieces."
519,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83,"And then I have to rely on my own gut instincts, so..."
520,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"Even now, I'm still not certain. >> PROBST: Kenny, with only six"
521,00:35:02.58,00:35:02.58,"people left, why do you think Bob chose you as one of the"
522,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,people to go on the gorilla reward?
523,00:35:07.92,00:35:07.92,">> Um, basically, at the last Tribal Council, uh, I-I flopped."
524,00:35:13.04,00:35:13.04,"I believed in Bob, and once I got back to camp, everybody"
525,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,noticed that I was the one who flopped.
526,00:35:19.17,00:35:19.17,"And I was very frustrated, and I asked him, ""Why did you lie to"
527,00:35:22.29,00:35:22.29,"me, Bob?"" And Bob promised me something."
528,00:35:24.25,00:35:24.25,He-he told me that he would try his best to win the next
529,00:35:26.71,00:35:26.71,"immunity challenge, and he would give me the immunity necklace if"
530,00:35:30.12,00:35:30.12,"he did win it. >> PROBST: Bob, is that true?"
531,00:35:32.88,00:35:32.88,>> That's-that's what I told him.
532,00:35:34.83,00:35:34.83,"Uh, we have since then sort of renegotiated things."
533,00:35:38.62,00:35:38.62,"Uh, I told him that if I feel that he is going to go home"
534,00:35:42.17,00:35:42.17,"tonight, that I'd give him the necklace."
535,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,"And after we discuss all this, I'll make that decision."
536,00:35:47.54,00:35:47.54,">> PROBST: And, Kenny, you're making the case tonight that"
537,00:35:49.58,00:35:49.58,you feel you're in danger. >> I was at such a great
538,00:35:52.21,00:35:52.21,"position, and now I'm on the outcast."
539,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,"You know, I turned on my alliance."
540,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,"Bob has the necklace, and where am I?"
541,00:36:00.75,00:36:00.75,">> PROBST: Crystal, got to make you feel a little good that"
542,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,"Bob, who clearly has some power in this game, picked you as one"
543,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,of the people to go on a big reward.
544,00:36:09.54,00:36:09.54,">> Um, I feel that he chose me because I haven't been on a"
545,00:36:13.79,00:36:13.79,reward in the 36 days that we've been here.
546,00:36:16.67,00:36:16.67,And I feel honored to at least get some kind of culture from
547,00:36:20.00,00:36:20.00,"being here in Africa. >> PROBST: Matty, do you think"
548,00:36:22.79,00:36:22.79,that's all it was... Bob just wanted somebody to have a
549,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"cultural experience, nothing to do with an opportunity to bond"
550,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,with two people who could help you get further in the game?
551,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,>> I believe Bob knows that Kenny and Crystal are the
552,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"tightest alliance since day one in this game, and they have"
553,00:36:38.12,00:36:38.12,"honestly dominated this game. >> PROBST: Kenny, you're"
554,00:36:41.04,00:36:41.04,shaking your head. >> I think that everybody
555,00:36:43.04,00:36:43.04,"thinks that me and Crystal are very tight, but I jumped from"
556,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,"my really good position in the five alliance that I had, and I"
557,00:36:50.04,00:36:50.04,feel like I could be the next to go.
558,00:36:52.67,00:36:52.67,">> PROBST: So, based on what you're saying then, how much"
559,00:36:55.08,00:36:55.08,more important is the deal you may or may not have made with
560,00:36:58.46,00:36:58.46,Bob tonight? >> It makes the deal even more
561,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,important to me because I've had a feeling all day that it
562,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,"might be me. >> PROBST: Matty, how you"
563,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83,"feeling tonight? >> Uh, very vulnerable."
564,00:37:11.54,00:37:11.54,"And, uh, I don't have that necklace on me, so that puts me"
565,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,on the chopping block next. >> PROBST: Let's talk about the
566,00:37:17.50,00:37:17.50,hidden immunity idol. I just want to remind everybody
567,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,that tonight is the last night you can play...
568,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,>> The hidden immunity idol? (Sugar laughs)
569,00:37:28.00,00:37:28.00,>> PROBST: You're claiming that's a hidden immunity idol?
570,00:37:30.21,00:37:30.21,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: I guess if you play"
571,00:37:32.38,00:37:32.38,"it, we'll find out that if it is."
572,00:37:34.04,00:37:34.04,Wouldn't be the first time somebody's played an idol that
573,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,wasn't the idol. (Sugar laughs)
574,00:37:39.17,00:37:39.17,>> I didn't make that one. (Bob chuckles)
575,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,">> PROBST: Bob, it's time to vote."
576,00:37:46.04,00:37:46.04,You have the individual immunity necklace.
577,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,You can keep it for yourself. You can give it to somebody
578,00:37:51.38,00:37:51.38,"else, including Kenny, if you want to."
579,00:37:53.04,00:37:53.04,It is up to you. >> I told Kenny if I thought he
580,00:37:56.17,00:37:56.17,"was going home tonight, I would give it to him."
581,00:37:59.25,00:37:59.25,And... I'm going to keep it because
582,00:38:05.71,00:38:05.71,I don't think he's going home tonight.
583,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,">> PROBST: All right, so, you cannot vote for Bob."
584,00:38:15.67,00:38:15.67,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
585,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,"Crystal, you're up. >> You were once part of my"
586,00:38:32.33,00:38:32.33,alliance. You wrote my name down one
587,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,"time, and it's time for me to pay you back."
588,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,">> Crystal, I've been waiting for this day for a long time,"
589,00:38:48.25,00:38:48.25,and I'm very happy that it's finally arrived.
590,00:39:01.83,00:39:01.83,">> Dude, you don't know how to talk or deal with people."
591,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,"So, good luck with that jury over there."
592,00:39:20.67,00:39:20.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
593,00:39:36.00,00:39:36.00,>> If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
594,00:39:38.46,00:39:38.46,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
595,00:40:10.25,00:40:10.25,>> PROBST: Thank you. The rules of Survivor state that
596,00:40:16.96,00:40:16.96,"if somebody plays a hidden immunity idol, then any votes"
597,00:40:19.33,00:40:19.33,cast against that person will not count.
598,00:40:21.33,00:40:21.33,The person with the next highest number of votes will be
599,00:40:23.58,00:40:23.58,voted out. This is indeed the hidden
600,00:40:27.25,00:40:27.25,immunity idol. Any votes cast for Matty will
601,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,not count. I'll now read the votes.
602,00:40:41.08,00:40:41.08,First vote: Matty. Does not count.
603,00:40:48.62,00:40:48.62,Matty. Does not count.
604,00:40:52.46,00:40:52.46,Next vote: Crystal. One vote for Crystal.
605,00:41:01.88,00:41:01.88,Crystal. Two votes Crystal.
606,00:41:11.08,00:41:11.08,13th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury:
607,00:41:14.08,00:41:14.08,Crystal. That's three votes.
608,00:41:15.67,00:41:15.67,That's enough. Need to bring me your torch.
609,00:41:26.96,00:41:26.96,"Crystal, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
610,00:41:45.83,00:41:45.83,">> PROBST: Well, we are down to five."
611,00:41:47.83,00:41:47.83,The million dollars is within sight.
612,00:41:51.21,00:41:51.21,"The question is, which one of the five of you will win it."
613,00:41:55.17,00:41:55.17,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

626,00:42:43.92,00:42:43.92,I did not know that Sugar turned on me.
627,00:42:47.00,00:42:47.00,I don't know what for. It kind of hurts with three
628,00:42:49.25,00:42:49.25,"days left in the game, but when I yelled at Matty, I don't think"
629,00:42:52.29,00:42:52.29,"it helped. It's been a great run, 36 days."
630,00:42:55.25,00:42:55.25,"Tried to play a fair game, and hopefully I made my friends and"
631,00:42:58.04,00:42:58.04,"family proud. And good luck, Kenny."
