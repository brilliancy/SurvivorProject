2,00:00:01.57,00:00:01.57,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.87,00:00:02.87, 16 strangers were abandoned
4,00:00:04.80,00:00:04.80, deep in the heart  of the Amazon jungle.
5,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67," For the first time,  the tribes"
6,00:00:09.57,00:00:09.57, were divided  into men and women.
7,00:00:11.63,00:00:11.63,This place was discovered in 1541-- Spanish explorer.
8,00:00:15.23,00:00:15.23,He encounters a tribe of very fierce female warriors.
9,00:00:18.07,00:00:18.07,This was the first notion
10,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,that women could survive just fine on their own.
11,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,"That is where the term ""Amazon women"" comes from."
12,00:00:24.90,00:00:24.90,(cheering)
13,00:00:26.07,00:00:26.07,Shove off!
14,00:00:27.33,00:00:27.33," From the start,  the women had trouble."
15,00:00:29.57,00:00:29.57,"SHAWNA: I just felt so stupid,  with the guys going off"
16,00:00:31.80,00:00:31.80," one way, the girls  couldn't untie..."
17,00:00:33.07,00:00:33.07,"well, I couldn't untie the knot."
18,00:00:34.80,00:00:34.80,PROBST: When the Jaburu women  finally arrived at camp...
19,00:00:37.03,00:00:37.03,(whooping)
20,00:00:38.80,00:00:38.80,...Christy revealed her secret.
21,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,And every tribe member should know that I am deaf.
22,00:00:43.70,00:00:43.70,JENNA: I'm wondering  how she's going to be able
23,00:00:45.07,00:00:45.07, to work with the group  when she can't
24,00:00:46.73,00:00:46.73,"-really hear well. -PROBST: From the beginning,"
25,00:00:48.67,00:00:48.67, some of the women found  surviving in the Amazon
26,00:00:52.23,00:00:52.23, tougher than they  ever imagined.
27,00:00:53.87,00:00:53.87,I don't know if I can do a challenge tomorrow.
28,00:00:56.07,00:00:56.07,I'm having trouble walking.
29,00:00:57.40,00:00:57.40,PROBST:  They didn't catch many fish.
30,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,HEIDI:  I was pretty sure
31,00:01:00.70,00:01:00.70," that after you gutted  the thing,"
32,00:01:02.17,00:01:02.17, there would've been...  there's just
33,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,nothing even left.
34,00:01:04.40,00:01:04.40,I feel like I'm eating vomit right now.
35,00:01:05.97,00:01:05.97,PROBST: And they had trouble  building shelter.
36,00:01:07.87,00:01:07.87,"-Oh, my God! -(screams)"
37,00:01:10.23,00:01:10.23,"PROBST: At Tambaqui,  things were different."
38,00:01:12.00,00:01:12.00,ALL: Tambaqui!
39,00:01:13.97,00:01:13.97,PROBST: The guys finished their shelter
40,00:01:15.80,00:01:15.80, under Roger's  self-proclaimed leadership.
41,00:01:17.80,00:01:17.80,We need them about three feet long-- the Y's--
42,00:01:20.03,00:01:20.03,"and there should be plenty of them, okay?"
43,00:01:22.20,00:01:22.20,"ROB: I know how to play  this game. I say, ""Yes, Roger."
44,00:01:24.40,00:01:24.40,"Yes, Roger. Sure, Roger."""
45,00:01:25.87,00:01:25.87,PROBST: And the tribe  felt confident.
46,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,"Yo, we're the favorites right now."
47,00:01:28.73,00:01:28.73,"RYAN:  Bottom line is,"
48,00:01:29.93,00:01:29.93," a lot of girls  over there are eye candy,"
49,00:01:32.03,00:01:32.03," but when it comes down to it,"
50,00:01:33.60,00:01:33.60,you want people that are going to be useful.
51,00:01:35.37,00:01:35.37,Survivors ready? Go!
52,00:01:37.23,00:01:37.23," At the first immunity  challenge, the Tambaqui men"
53,00:01:39.53,00:01:39.53, quickly jumped ahead.
54,00:01:40.70,00:01:40.70,You're good. Feet can't touch! No!
55,00:01:43.20,00:01:43.20,"Daniel and Ryan, got to head back."
56,00:01:45.10,00:01:45.10, But Ryan and Daniel  blew the men's lead.
57,00:01:47.67,00:01:47.67,Hug the log!
58,00:01:49.07,00:01:49.07, And Heidi led the women  to victory.
59,00:01:51.53,00:01:51.53,Jaburu wins immunity!
60,00:01:53.47,00:01:53.47," Tambaqui went  to Tribal Council,"
61,00:01:55.80,00:01:55.80,where Ryan was the first person
62,00:01:57.80,00:01:57.80, voted out of the tribe.
63,00:01:59.07,00:01:59.07,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
64,00:02:03.53,00:02:03.53, 15 remain.
65,00:02:05.07,00:02:05.07, Who will be voted out tonight?
66,00:03:31.90,00:03:31.90,JANET: We've been sleeping  in the elements
67,00:03:34.70,00:03:34.70, for four nights now.
68,00:03:36.50,00:03:36.50," The shelter that we have  does not, you know,"
69,00:03:39.00,00:03:39.00,live up to its name.
70,00:03:40.17,00:03:40.17,It does not shelter us.
71,00:03:40.93,00:03:40.93,Look at it. It goes... (makes high-pitched noise)
72,00:03:42.87,00:03:42.87,It's-it's narrower over here and wider over here.
73,00:03:44.70,00:03:44.70,-Mm-hmm. -SHAWNA: What we wanted do there
74,00:03:46.83,00:03:46.83,was reinforce the center because it's breaking.
75,00:03:49.40,00:03:49.40,HEIDI: There's not a roof  over our heads
76,00:03:52.30,00:03:52.30, because there's so many  other priorities going on.
77,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93," Like, number one is water."
78,00:03:57.53,00:03:57.53, Everybody's energy is being  in that fire and water.
79,00:04:01.63,00:04:01.63," Water, fire, water, fire.  I mean, we just..."
80,00:04:03.87,00:04:03.87,it takes everyone's energy just to do that.
81,00:04:06.00,00:04:06.00,DEENA: We need to designate.
82,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,"We need one person on fire, water, logs."
83,00:04:10.20,00:04:10.20,"JEANNE: Okay, one person-- fire, water, logs."
84,00:04:12.17,00:04:12.17,Who's going to do that?
85,00:04:14.00,00:04:14.00,"JEANNE:  Our camp is so disorganized,"
86,00:04:16.27,00:04:16.27,because we don't have a leader.
87,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07, You really need to bring it  together and unify it
88,00:04:20.90,00:04:20.90,"and work as a team, and without a leader,"
89,00:04:22.87,00:04:22.87,we're not going to get it together.
90,00:04:24.43,00:04:24.43,"See, since we are not using this section, are we, like..."
91,00:04:28.03,00:04:28.03,"I mean, do we want to try to go, like, tepee style?"
92,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,I really don't care if we have a high ceiling or not.
93,00:04:33.00,00:04:33.00,"-I don't care, either. -I don't know."
94,00:04:34.30,00:04:34.30,I think those poles are fine.
95,00:04:35.80,00:04:35.80,So A-frame could be the way to go.
96,00:04:38.23,00:04:38.23,SHAWNA: We don't have  the necessary stuff
97,00:04:39.80,00:04:39.80, to survive right now.
98,00:04:41.10,00:04:41.10, We are not surviving.
99,00:04:42.93,00:04:42.93, I think the guys  are much better off than us.
100,00:04:45.23,00:04:45.23, I have no doubt that
101,00:04:46.90,00:04:46.90,they probably had their stuff together before we did.
102,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,"Guys, this looks delicious."
103,00:05:05.93,00:05:05.93,"ALEX: Here we are in the Amazon,  in this rain forest,"
104,00:05:09.80,00:05:09.80," and we've built our shelter,  we're making do with our food."
105,00:05:13.83,00:05:13.83,We did finally figure out
106,00:05:15.03,00:05:15.03,"how to use the manioc flour, instead of just"
107,00:05:16.83,00:05:16.83," eating it dry, which was nice."
108,00:05:18.67,00:05:18.67,"MATTHEW: Hotcakes are on, boys!"
109,00:05:20.77,00:05:20.77,ALEX:   We're surviving.
110,00:05:22.53,00:05:22.53,"Not the Ritz, but it's... it's pretty cool."
111,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,"It's hot, guys. You have to balance it in your hands."
112,00:05:29.43,00:05:29.43,What a bunch of lamebrains we are.
113,00:05:30.90,00:05:30.90,This is the way to do it.
114,00:05:32.33,00:05:32.33,It's filling.
115,00:05:33.63,00:05:33.63,"It's filling, and it tastes average."
116,00:05:35.50,00:05:35.50,It's great.
117,00:05:36.67,00:05:36.67,All right. We going to fish?
118,00:05:38.93,00:05:38.93,Let's fish.
119,00:05:40.13,00:05:40.13,-Here we go. -Here we go.
120,00:05:44.43,00:05:44.43,"All right, ready?"
121,00:05:45.77,00:05:45.77,"Yeah, here we go, guys-- right side."
122,00:05:47.97,00:05:47.97,Easy on the left side.
123,00:05:49.83,00:05:49.83,"Good job, guys."
124,00:05:51.93,00:05:51.93,ROGER:  The last few days here
125,00:05:53.77,00:05:53.77, have been  a little embarrassing.
126,00:05:55.77,00:05:55.77," Uh, we lost the first  immunity challenge,"
127,00:05:57.60,00:05:57.60, but we've established
128,00:05:58.77,00:05:58.77,a... a very good team.
129,00:06:01.13,00:06:01.13,"All right, everybody ready?"
130,00:06:02.60,00:06:02.60,"One, two, three."
131,00:06:04.93,00:06:04.93,That was a good one.
132,00:06:06.27,00:06:06.27,"-Yeah, nice cast. -Coordinated effort."
133,00:06:08.47,00:06:08.47,DAVE: I think what we're doing  is really settling down
134,00:06:11.23,00:06:11.23,to a schedule.
135,00:06:12.40,00:06:12.40,We... we got our shelter built. Uh... we're
136,00:06:14.57,00:06:14.57," assessing our food. You know, what do we need to do"
137,00:06:16.73,00:06:16.73, in order to sustain ourselves  for the long haul?
138,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27,"BUTCH: One, two, guys, we're getting her down."
139,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,It's going to take a while.
140,00:06:23.40,00:06:23.40,"One, two, three."
141,00:06:29.87,00:06:29.87,(thunder crashing)
142,00:06:34.77,00:06:34.77,They look pretty angry.
143,00:06:36.83,00:06:36.83,Getting a little concerned?
144,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67,"-Want to go back to camp, guys? -You can hear it. -Yeah."
145,00:06:40.97,00:06:40.97,"All right, Tambaqui, let's get"
146,00:06:42.23,00:06:42.23,-on the move. -Let's go.
147,00:06:43.60,00:06:43.60,"One, two, three."
148,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97,Wind's to our back.
149,00:06:47.27,00:06:47.27,It was so sunny a minute ago.
150,00:06:49.77,00:06:49.77,"DAVE: Not seconds  before we got back, it..."
151,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,it just dumped. It rained hard.
152,00:06:54.47,00:06:54.47,(thunder crashing)
153,00:06:57.30,00:06:57.30,(whooping)
154,00:06:59.50,00:06:59.50,ALEX:  It came down in buckets.
155,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70," But inside the shelter,"
156,00:07:06.03,00:07:06.03, there were a couple of drips  here and there;
157,00:07:07.90,00:07:07.90,"pretty much, we were dry."
158,00:07:11.27,00:07:11.27,It'd suck to be outside right now.
159,00:07:14.07,00:07:14.07,(thunder crashing)
160,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,Have a seat near the fire.
161,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,I am so cold right now.
162,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,Right now... a
163,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,"ridiculous, horrendous storm just hit us,"
164,00:07:44.73,00:07:44.73,and we're getting buckets... buckets of water on us.
165,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,The ground's fallen through.
166,00:07:49.90,00:07:49.90,Our... our stakes are flimsy.
167,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53,"We didn't get our structure up in time, so we are wet."
168,00:07:55.87,00:07:55.87,"We lost our flint, so we can't rebuild a fire."
169,00:07:59.03,00:07:59.03,"So, right now, we're focusing on the fire shelter."
170,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23,"And, um, these palms are... are crap,"
171,00:08:05.53,00:08:05.53,so we're trying to figure out how to weave them together
172,00:08:07.80,00:08:07.80,"to ensure that that thing doesn't go out,"
173,00:08:09.50,00:08:09.50,"'cause that's our lifeline,"
174,00:08:10.97,00:08:10.97,and serious trouble if that gets hit.
175,00:08:13.87,00:08:13.87,I can't believe how badly this sucks.
176,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,We thought we'd have more time than this.
177,00:08:19.43,00:08:19.43,"Forgot that we're in the middle of the Amazon,"
178,00:08:21.50,00:08:21.50,and that torrential rainstorms come by daily.
179,00:08:43.70,00:08:43.70,"Okay, it is your first reward challenge."
180,00:08:47.77,00:08:47.77,"Today, we're going to test how well you communicate."
181,00:08:50.43,00:08:50.43,Your ability to listen to each other and take direction
182,00:08:52.93,00:08:52.93,will determine the outcome.
183,00:08:54.37,00:08:54.37," It'll consist of a puzzle,"
184,00:08:55.73,00:08:55.73, which will demand teamwork  to build. The 30 pieces
185,00:08:58.60,00:08:58.60,required
186,00:08:59.50,00:08:59.50, to solve your puzzle
187,00:09:00.73,00:09:00.73, have been scattered  in the jungle clearing.
188,00:09:02.40,00:09:02.40, You're going to pick
189,00:09:03.40,00:09:03.40,one tribe member.
190,00:09:04.93,00:09:04.93,They're going to be your guide.
191,00:09:06.33,00:09:06.33,The other tribe members will be blindfolded in pairs.
192,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,The guide will navigate the pairs
193,00:09:12.03,00:09:12.03," through the clearing,  which has trees and logs"
194,00:09:15.13,00:09:15.13," and mud,  as you gather the pieces."
195,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,"Once you've gathered all 30 pieces,"
196,00:09:19.77,00:09:19.77,you can take your blindfolds off
197,00:09:21.30,00:09:21.30,and start to put the puzzle together.
198,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,First tribe to complete the puzzle wins reward.
199,00:09:25.87,00:09:25.87,Want to know what you're playing for?
200,00:09:27.33,00:09:27.33,"-Yeah. -Well, the river"
201,00:09:28.50,00:09:28.50,is a source of a lot of food.
202,00:09:30.93,00:09:30.93,"Outside of both your guys' camps,"
203,00:09:32.43,00:09:32.43,"there really are fish this big,"
204,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,and the best way to catch them: fish bait.
205,00:09:36.43,00:09:36.43,"-Oh. -Oh, yeah."
206,00:09:38.13,00:09:38.13,-Whoo! -Nice.
207,00:09:39.50,00:09:39.50,There's a lot of bait here.
208,00:09:41.07,00:09:41.07,Should provide a lot of food.
209,00:09:42.57,00:09:42.57,"Jaburu, because you have one extra member,"
210,00:09:43.97,00:09:43.97,you're sitting somebody out.
211,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10,You also have to decide who your guides are.
212,00:09:47.30,00:09:47.30,"Jaburu, who's sitting out?"
213,00:09:48.50,00:09:48.50,"Christy, you're sitting out."
214,00:09:50.03,00:09:50.03,Who's your guide? Joanna.
215,00:09:51.77,00:09:51.77,"Tambaqui, who's your guide?"
216,00:09:53.23,00:09:53.23,Butch. Let's get blindfolded up.
217,00:09:58.17,00:09:58.17,"All right, guys, here we go, for reward."
218,00:10:00.10,00:10:00.10,Survivors ready? Go!
219,00:10:02.03,00:10:02.03,Each of you guys turn around.
220,00:10:03.40,00:10:03.40,Turn around the other way.
221,00:10:04.77,00:10:04.77,"All right, first thing-- Roger,"
222,00:10:06.60,00:10:06.60,you're going to go forward five steps.
223,00:10:08.40,00:10:08.40,"Shawna, go forward ten paces."
224,00:10:09.93,00:10:09.93,Just go forward. It's a... it's a tree stump
225,00:10:11.93,00:10:11.93,"in front of you, Shawna, but keep going. Step high."
226,00:10:14.03,00:10:14.03,"Hey, um, Ro-Roger, turn around to your right."
227,00:10:17.23,00:10:17.23,More. Straight ahead.
228,00:10:19.10,00:10:19.10,"Reach your left hand out, Shawna. There you go."
229,00:10:21.03,00:10:21.03,"-Come to me. -BUTCH: That's it. No, no, no, no."
230,00:10:23.83,00:10:23.83,"Dan, not you. Not you, Dan. Roger. All right, bring it back."
231,00:10:26.63,00:10:26.63,"Heidi, go forward ten spaces, to your right."
232,00:10:29.03,00:10:29.03,BUTCH: That's right where you started.
233,00:10:30.07,00:10:30.07,"Now, keep going. Whoa. Stop there."
234,00:10:31.47,00:10:31.47,-Hold on a second. -Drop that board.
235,00:10:32.93,00:10:32.93,"PROBST: Guys, remember, this is about clear communication."
236,00:10:35.07,00:10:35.07,"Whoa. Right there. Whoa, stop, stop."
237,00:10:37.10,00:10:37.10,"Sorry, guys. Sorry."
238,00:10:38.50,00:10:38.50,"All right, now, straight ahead."
239,00:10:39.70,00:10:39.70,"PROBST: Tambaqui, you got to talk"
240,00:10:41.20,00:10:41.20,"-to each other. -Uh, uh, Roger..."
241,00:10:44.57,00:10:44.57,"I mean, Dave. Dave."
242,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,"All right, straight ahead 15 steps."
243,00:10:47.93,00:10:47.93,"Heidi, left, left, left, left. There you go."
244,00:10:49.93,00:10:49.93,PROBST: Girls are way ahead of the guys.
245,00:10:51.57,00:10:51.57,"Rob... excuse me, Alex."
246,00:10:52.87,00:10:52.87,"I'm sorry, Mitch... Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt."
247,00:10:55.77,00:10:55.77,"Right, there it is."
248,00:10:56.90,00:10:56.90,"Okay, you guys, turn around."
249,00:10:58.27,00:10:58.27,Shuffle-step back toward me.
250,00:10:59.57,00:10:59.57,I can't see my other guy.
251,00:11:01.40,00:11:01.40,"Tambaqui, you better pick it up."
252,00:11:02.93,00:11:02.93,Drop your piece. Drop your piece.
253,00:11:05.37,00:11:05.37,"That's 27 Jaburu, 18 Tambaqui."
254,00:11:08.73,00:11:08.73,"Alex, reach down."
255,00:11:11.13,00:11:11.13,"No, not that. That's a stick."
256,00:11:13.10,00:11:13.10,Jaburu down to three pieces left.
257,00:11:15.00,00:11:15.00,"JOANNA: Drop it, Shawna."
258,00:11:16.63,00:11:16.63,"Butch, put the sign down?"
259,00:11:17.63,00:11:17.63,"No, no, not you. I'm sorry."
260,00:11:19.03,00:11:19.03,"Uh, Matthew, all right, to your left."
261,00:11:21.07,00:11:21.07,"Left, left, left."
262,00:11:22.47,00:11:22.47,PROBST: The girls are way ahead of the guys.
263,00:11:24.53,00:11:24.53,"Three... three more steps, Alex."
264,00:11:25.73,00:11:25.73,"Keep coming-- three more steps. One, two, three,"
265,00:11:27.43,00:11:27.43,"-four, stop. -JOANNA: Come right, you got our last piece."
266,00:11:29.40,00:11:29.40,"Come on, Jenna. Keep coming to me."
267,00:11:30.40,00:11:30.40,"Step forward, this way."
268,00:11:31.77,00:11:31.77,Follow my voice! Follow my voice! Drop it!
269,00:11:33.13,00:11:33.13,PROBST: That's it for Jaburu. Take off the blindfolds.
270,00:11:35.27,00:11:35.27,"-Start solving the puzzle. -JOANNA: Let's go, Jaburu!"
271,00:11:37.20,00:11:37.20,-Take the blindfolds off! -We can take them off?
272,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,-Let's put the puzzle together. -PROBST: Jaburu is starting
273,00:11:41.13,00:11:41.13,on the puzzle.
274,00:11:43.90,00:11:43.90,"Let's go, Tambaqui. You're still in this."
275,00:11:45.43,00:11:45.43,"-Butch, this is it, right? -Butch! -BUTCH: To your left."
276,00:11:47.63,00:11:47.63,"You got it, Roger, to your left."
277,00:11:49.00,00:11:49.00,-Keep going. -This is Roger! Is this it?
278,00:11:50.63,00:11:50.63,Right there's a frame. Right there's a frame.
279,00:11:51.97,00:11:51.97,-Come around the frame. -Is that the right sign?!
280,00:11:54.00,00:11:54.00,"Alex... or Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, you go"
281,00:11:55.80,00:11:55.80,"to your right now, to your right now."
282,00:11:57.53,00:11:57.53,"-Butch! -All right, Alex, you're going to stop right there."
283,00:12:01.17,00:12:01.17,Wait. I need a vine.
284,00:12:03.30,00:12:03.30,"Looks like an ""E."""
285,00:12:05.53,00:12:05.53,Butch!
286,00:12:06.70,00:12:06.70,"Roger, keep following my voice back."
287,00:12:08.50,00:12:08.50,JEANNE: Now I need a corner of a square.
288,00:12:10.50,00:12:10.50,"BUTCH: Now, you guys come toward me, straight ahead."
289,00:12:12.00,00:12:12.00,"We're in. Go, drop it. Now, take your time, guys."
290,00:12:14.57,00:12:14.57,"Tambaqui, take off your blindfolds."
291,00:12:16.43,00:12:16.43,Start solving your puzzle.
292,00:12:18.33,00:12:18.33,Jaburu has a big lead.
293,00:12:20.57,00:12:20.57,-Got to be a top one. -It's got nothing on it?
294,00:12:22.73,00:12:22.73,"No, it's got... turn it over, Butch."
295,00:12:27.07,00:12:27.07,I need bright yellow.
296,00:12:28.43,00:12:28.43,"See these square... these, uh, triangles right here?"
297,00:12:30.93,00:12:30.93,Those are the teeny corners. Does anyone have any yellow...?
298,00:12:33.07,00:12:33.07,PROBST: Make sure to check the puzzle reference.
299,00:12:34.97,00:12:34.97,You guys may be closer than you think with a piece.
300,00:12:44.20,00:12:44.20,We need fish. We need fish.
301,00:12:46.47,00:12:46.47,"-Oh, right there. -Whoo!"
302,00:12:50.53,00:12:50.53,We're having dinner tonight.
303,00:12:53.20,00:12:53.20,"Yeah, that's it. That's it."
304,00:12:54.33,00:12:54.33,Whoo!
305,00:12:55.53,00:12:55.53,"-Jaburu wins reward! -Yeah, baby!"
306,00:12:57.47,00:12:57.47,"-Oh, yeah. -Wins their second challenge in a row."
307,00:13:05.47,00:13:05.47,"From what I know about the Amazon, you should be eating"
308,00:13:07.70,00:13:07.70,very well for the next couple of days.
309,00:13:08.93,00:13:08.93,Fish will love this.
310,00:13:10.03,00:13:10.03,Congratulations.
311,00:13:11.10,00:13:11.10,You are two for two. Celebrate.
312,00:13:13.63,00:13:13.63,You the man.
313,00:13:45.07,00:13:45.07,"ROGER: I have to admit,"
314,00:13:46.47,00:13:46.47,I'm not accustomed to losing to women.
315,00:13:48.70,00:13:48.70,I don't care what it is.
316,00:13:50.43,00:13:50.43,It's just not my deal.
317,00:13:52.33,00:13:52.33,Not that I'm a chauvinist. It just...
318,00:13:54.97,00:13:54.97,BUTCH: It's just my personality
319,00:13:56.37,00:13:56.37,"that makes a man do it, and I'm..."
320,00:13:58.07,00:13:58.07,"something like that, I expect to win."
321,00:13:59.63,00:13:59.63,"We got our asses kicked, though."
322,00:14:03.97,00:14:03.97,DAVE: I think the mood in camp  is a little frustration.
323,00:14:06.63,00:14:06.63,"I mean, everybody wants to win."
324,00:14:07.90,00:14:07.90,"And, particularly,"
325,00:14:09.67,00:14:09.67,seven guys don't want to lose to a bunch of girls.
326,00:14:12.57,00:14:12.57,"If you win, it's great, but if you lose,"
327,00:14:14.80,00:14:14.80,"no... no matter who you are out here,"
328,00:14:16.53,00:14:16.53,you have a tendency to want to blame yourself.
329,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,We were running around like chickens
330,00:14:20.40,00:14:20.40,-with their heads cut off. -Yep.
331,00:14:22.40,00:14:22.40, ALEX: We're feeling  the pressure a lot.
332,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87, And there's a lot  of pressure on us now.
333,00:14:25.43,00:14:25.43, We've lost two in a row.
334,00:14:26.63,00:14:26.63,(chuckles) We could have used that bait.
335,00:14:28.63,00:14:28.63,Bait would have been nice.
336,00:14:29.97,00:14:29.97,"DAVE: I think, you know, we got an immunity challenge,"
337,00:14:31.53,00:14:31.53,"-what, in two days? -Yep."
338,00:14:32.60,00:14:32.60,We'll go into that.
339,00:14:33.63,00:14:33.63,"I think, if we take a deep breath--"
340,00:14:36.00,00:14:36.00,"ten, 15 seconds-- sit back"
341,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33,"and work on it as a team, we'll be all right."
342,00:14:57.73,00:14:57.73,Good batch.
343,00:14:59.20,00:14:59.20,JEANNE: Is it?
344,00:15:00.60,00:15:00.60,"Mmm, mmm!"
345,00:15:01.83,00:15:01.83,That tasted like you put
346,00:15:03.13,00:15:03.13,some beautiful spices in it today.
347,00:15:04.87,00:15:04.87,"HEIDI: 'Cause I did try to burn it a little bit more,"
348,00:15:07.17,00:15:07.17,since it was wet in there.
349,00:15:08.53,00:15:08.53,JEANNE:  We need food-- real food.
350,00:15:10.03,00:15:10.03, The manioc--
351,00:15:11.20,00:15:11.20,the fried manioc or whatever--
352,00:15:13.23,00:15:13.23,burnt manioc-- was just no good.
353,00:15:15.13,00:15:15.13,"-Oh, it's disgusting. -Yeah, it really is."
354,00:15:17.10,00:15:17.10,It's got maggots just everywhere in there.
355,00:15:18.80,00:15:18.80,Aah! I didn't know about the maggots.
356,00:15:20.73,00:15:20.73,"-Oh, yeah. -Oh..."
357,00:15:23.23,00:15:23.23,I did not know about them.
358,00:15:27.23,00:15:27.23,"JANET: Mentally,  I can handle this game great,"
359,00:15:29.70,00:15:29.70," but physically,"
360,00:15:31.20,00:15:31.20,"it's really, you know, taking its toll,"
361,00:15:33.60,00:15:33.60,and it's so much tougher than I thought.
362,00:15:35.47,00:15:35.47,-I just wish we could catch some fish. -I know.
363,00:15:37.53,00:15:37.53,Did you get any nibbles?
364,00:15:38.80,00:15:38.80,"-Did they go for it? -Yeah, I got... I got about six."
365,00:15:40.57,00:15:40.57,I saw them.
366,00:15:42.03,00:15:42.03,"JENNA: We've had nothing to eat  in, like, five days."
367,00:15:43.77,00:15:43.77, Barely anything to eat.
368,00:15:46.00,00:15:46.00,"But, for the challenges, I mean, so far,"
369,00:15:47.70,00:15:47.70,we've... we've done really well.
370,00:15:48.90,00:15:48.90,"We've won them both over the guys,"
371,00:15:50.63,00:15:50.63,who are very cocky and think that they...
372,00:15:52.30,00:15:52.30,they were going to beat us both times.
373,00:15:57.33,00:15:57.33,"JEANNE: My fishing technique is,"
374,00:15:59.07,00:15:59.07,put the bait on the hook and pray.
375,00:16:02.33,00:16:02.33, We've had  a few problems fishing.
376,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33, Nothing was really biting  out here.
377,00:16:06.37,00:16:06.37,"This stuff is tough, whatever this is."
378,00:16:09.23,00:16:09.23, And you can see them.  They're all around you.
379,00:16:10.87,00:16:10.87, They're jumping.
380,00:16:12.43,00:16:12.43,"Come on, fishies."
381,00:16:14.17,00:16:14.17,Come on!
382,00:16:16.43,00:16:16.43,"Oh, there's a beauty coming up."
383,00:16:19.90,00:16:19.90,"Oh, yes!"
384,00:16:21.70,00:16:21.70,(squealing)
385,00:16:24.20,00:16:24.20,Gosh darn it.
386,00:16:28.03,00:16:28.03,JEANNE: Bait's working.  We're going to get fish.
387,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33," Need a little time  and a little patience,"
388,00:16:33.60,00:16:33.60,but I feel better about the future
389,00:16:35.50,00:16:35.50,"because now we have the bait, and I know how to fish,"
390,00:16:38.43,00:16:38.43,and it's going to be okay.
391,00:16:48.17,00:16:48.17,ALEX: My trouble is people who  tell other people how to live.
392,00:16:51.17,00:16:51.17,-I'm doing okay so far. -As long as you're not hurting...
393,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,as long as you're not hurting somebody.
394,00:16:54.50,00:16:54.50,-Yeah. -If they want to believe
395,00:16:55.67,00:16:55.67,"what they want to believe,"
396,00:16:56.93,00:16:56.93,-that's all fine and well. -Mm-hmm.
397,00:16:58.27,00:16:58.27,It's just like the gay issue.
398,00:16:59.83,00:16:59.83,"I mean, it doesn't matter to me."
399,00:17:02.00,00:17:02.00,ROB: I was really stumped  on who I could get
400,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,"that might vote against Roger, up until this morning,"
401,00:17:08.73,00:17:08.73,when a lightbulb went off in my head.
402,00:17:10.80,00:17:10.80,"As long as they don't bother me, I don't give a damn."
403,00:17:13.77,00:17:13.77,"I don't like to see them flaunting it, though."
404,00:17:16.67,00:17:16.67,"-I mean, that... -Really?"
405,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,You like to see two guys out on the street...
406,00:17:20.30,00:17:20.30,-Doesn't bother me at all. -...making out and all that?
407,00:17:22.17,00:17:22.17,-I don't care. -It doesn't bother you at all?
408,00:17:23.53,00:17:23.53,No. Could care less.
409,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,Alex and Roger had
410,00:17:26.53,00:17:26.53,a little bit of a tiff this morning
411,00:17:28.67,00:17:28.67, -over homosexuality.  -You don't know!
412,00:17:30.23,00:17:30.23,"You've never been in the situation, and you're..."
413,00:17:31.87,00:17:31.87,"Alex, that is not natural."
414,00:17:33.93,00:17:33.93,-Period. -Who said... who said anything about natural?
415,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,"ALEX: First of all,  I'm straight, so I don't know"
416,00:17:37.90,00:17:37.90,"what it is to be homosexual,"
417,00:17:39.37,00:17:39.37,"and Roger is straight, so he doesn't know, either."
418,00:17:41.60,00:17:41.60," What it comes down to is,  if it's what makes you happy"
419,00:17:45.23,00:17:45.23," and if it's not  hurting anybody,"
420,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,then who cares?
421,00:17:49.40,00:17:49.40,The sex part of it that goes with the male and the woman...
422,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,-Mm-hmm. -...is to procreate.
423,00:17:53.57,00:17:53.57,-Yeah. So you're only... -It's an expression...
424,00:17:55.10,00:17:55.10,"So what you're saying is, you've only had sex two times--"
425,00:17:57.33,00:17:57.33,"the two times you wanted to procreate, that was"
426,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,-the only times you've had sex with your wife? -No. No.
427,00:18:01.40,00:18:01.40,"Okay, then it wasn't about procreation."
428,00:18:02.90,00:18:02.90,"-It wasn't. Sorry. -ROB: Now,  what I'm hoping is that"
429,00:18:05.53,00:18:05.53,this has planted the seed in Al... in Alex's head
430,00:18:08.63,00:18:08.63, that Roger may not be  all he's cracked up to be.
431,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,Roger is a bigot.
432,00:18:13.23,00:18:13.23,You tell me why it is not wrong.
433,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,-I'll tell you why it's not wrong. -Okay.
434,00:18:16.37,00:18:16.37,Because I know people who live their life
435,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,"for a long time being ""straight,"""
436,00:18:21.33,00:18:21.33,and they came out of the closet and have had more love
437,00:18:25.23,00:18:25.23,and joy and happiness as a result of doing that
438,00:18:27.73,00:18:27.73,-and being true to themselves... -Mm-hmm.
439,00:18:29.37,00:18:29.37,...than they ever would have living a lie.
440,00:18:31.00,00:18:31.00,-Mm-hmm. -That's why it's okay.
441,00:18:32.87,00:18:32.87,-That makes it okay? -Absolutely.
442,00:18:35.13,00:18:35.13,"ROGER: You have your opinion, and I have mine."
443,00:18:37.70,00:18:37.70,"-Okay. -And you can't convince me,"
444,00:18:39.67,00:18:39.67,-and I can't convince you. -I don't want to convince you.
445,00:18:42.40,00:18:42.40,I have no desire to convince you at all.
446,00:18:55.93,00:18:55.93,-(water sloshing) -JANET: I'm disoriented.
447,00:18:58.43,00:18:58.43,Are we on the trail that...?
448,00:18:59.70,00:18:59.70,-DEENA: Whoa! Here's some light. -Yeah.
449,00:19:06.53,00:19:06.53,"DEENA: And when it  gets dark in the Amazon,"
450,00:19:08.87,00:19:08.87, it's not like  dark in the city.
451,00:19:11.37,00:19:11.37,It's you can't see where you're going.
452,00:19:14.13,00:19:14.13, You can't see in front of you.
453,00:19:16.53,00:19:16.53, So our fire is our life.
454,00:19:18.07,00:19:18.07, And...
455,00:19:19.23,00:19:19.23, half of the tribe went nutty.
456,00:19:21.40,00:19:21.40,(thunder crashing)
457,00:19:25.33,00:19:25.33,"JOANNA: What the Devil meant for evil, God done turned into good."
458,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,"They tried to take our roof, and we're still dry."
459,00:19:31.40,00:19:31.40,The rain just stopped.
460,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"JOANNA: Thank you, Lord. Cover us."
461,00:19:35.70,00:19:35.70,"Get that idol gone, put him out there somewhere tomorrow."
462,00:19:38.10,00:19:38.10,-(laughing) -I'm serious.
463,00:19:39.33,00:19:39.33,I'm not touching it.
464,00:19:40.70,00:19:40.70,DEENA: Joanna doesn't  like the immunity idol
465,00:19:42.87,00:19:42.87," because she thinks  that it is an idol,"
466,00:19:44.37,00:19:44.37, and idols are...
467,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57," forbidden via  the Ten Commandments, right?"
468,00:19:48.43,00:19:48.43," ""Thou shalt have  no other gods before me."""
469,00:19:50.57,00:19:50.57, She didn't want it  in the camp at all.
470,00:19:53.03,00:19:53.03," She didn't want to touch it,  she doesn't want to hold it."
471,00:19:54.57,00:19:54.57,She wants nothing to do with it.
472,00:19:55.87,00:19:55.87,(thunder crashing)
473,00:19:57.33,00:19:57.33,JEANNE: Why can't you look at it as a symbol instead of an idol?
474,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,JOANNA: Because it's not-- it's called an idol for a reason.
475,00:20:03.70,00:20:03.70,"-Well, why don't you change the name? -It's almost like..."
476,00:20:05.93,00:20:05.93,"-No, I can't do that. -But it meant..."
477,00:20:07.67,00:20:07.67,it meant that we were unified and we...
478,00:20:08.97,00:20:08.97,"JOANNA: No, you don't understand."
479,00:20:11.07,00:20:11.07," You know,  some people worship Buddha,"
480,00:20:12.43,00:20:12.43, and some people do that  or whatever.
481,00:20:13.73,00:20:13.73," I worship the most high  El Elyon God,"
482,00:20:16.70,00:20:16.70," Jehovah Jireh,  El Shaddai, and he"
483,00:20:18.93,00:20:18.93,despises idol worship.
484,00:20:20.27,00:20:20.27,"You... if you read the Old Testament, they got struck down,"
485,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03,"and that's why we got rained on last night,"
486,00:20:25.27,00:20:25.27,bringing the idol into our... our tribe.
487,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,That idol is the reason why we're all here right now.
488,00:20:30.40,00:20:30.40,JOANNA: That idol's not the reason we're here.
489,00:20:31.77,00:20:31.77,We won before we even had the idol.
490,00:20:33.47,00:20:33.47,"As soon as we lose, we lose the idol,"
491,00:20:35.27,00:20:35.27,"so if that idol is our friend,"
492,00:20:36.63,00:20:36.63,why isn't he with us when we were doing bad?
493,00:20:38.57,00:20:38.57,-(thunder crashes) -I'm gonna talk
494,00:20:40.47,00:20:40.47,(laughs): all night long about the goodness of the Lord
495,00:20:44.10,00:20:44.10,and the land of the living.
496,00:20:45.63,00:20:45.63,-DEENA: Couldn't you do it in a whisper? -No.
497,00:20:48.30,00:20:48.30,-I haven't been to sleep yet. -(laughing)
498,00:20:50.40,00:20:50.40,(thunder crashing)
499,00:21:03.50,00:21:03.50,"CHRISTY: So, that's the disadvantage"
500,00:21:04.80,00:21:04.80,"of me being deaf at night, right?"
501,00:21:06.53,00:21:06.53,-Yup. -'Cause I miss out on that.
502,00:21:08.10,00:21:08.10,"CHRISTY:  As soon as it gets dark,"
503,00:21:09.63,00:21:09.63," I can't see,  I can't read their lips,"
504,00:21:12.87,00:21:12.87," and I can't hear,"
505,00:21:14.10,00:21:14.10,so I'm totally like... (blows raspberry)
506,00:21:16.53,00:21:16.53,out of the group.
507,00:21:18.30,00:21:18.30,"Well, that's why I talked to you yesterday."
508,00:21:19.93,00:21:19.93,You're missing a lot of the...
509,00:21:21.10,00:21:21.10,"-The inter... -Right, and then that just makes me think,"
510,00:21:23.10,00:21:23.10,"it's like, so maybe I am really at a disadvantage,"
511,00:21:25.60,00:21:25.60,"-because... you know? -You definitely are,"
512,00:21:27.53,00:21:27.53,'cause you can't... yeah.
513,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,JEANNE:  Christy had asked me
514,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,"what we talk about at night, and if I could fill her in,"
515,00:21:34.53,00:21:34.53," so I said, ""You know what,  I just want to let you know"
516,00:21:37.67,00:21:37.67," ""that Joanna is not excited  about the idol like we are,"
517,00:21:40.90,00:21:40.90," so just wanted  to let you know."""
518,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,"And she goes, ""Well, that's stupid."""
519,00:21:44.50,00:21:44.50," Then Joanna walked by, and..."
520,00:21:46.43,00:21:46.43, it just was a...
521,00:21:47.67,00:21:47.67, dog-eat-dog situation.
522,00:21:49.80,00:21:49.80,-You are going around telling people. -I...
523,00:21:51.27,00:21:51.27,-That's not right. -I said it is your opinion.
524,00:21:52.83,00:21:52.83,"You didn't say it like that-- you said, ""That's your opinion!"""
525,00:21:54.77,00:21:54.77,"No, I didn't mean it that way. I honestly, I didn't mean it..."
526,00:21:56.30,00:21:56.30,But why are you insulted? Why are you so insulted?
527,00:21:58.00,00:21:58.00,I'm not going around telling people about
528,00:21:59.20,00:21:59.20,"you getting up in my face saying it, am I?"
529,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,"Don't interject in my conversation negatively,"
530,00:22:03.33,00:22:03.33,because I'm gonna shut you down with my hand.
531,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,"-Okay, okay, so now I know. -You're gonna get the hand."
532,00:22:07.43,00:22:07.43,"-Choose somebody else. -Hey, hey, excuse me, we both made"
533,00:22:09.03,00:22:09.03,"a mistake. I said that, you put a hand in my face..."
534,00:22:10.57,00:22:10.57,But my mistake came after your mistake.
535,00:22:12.10,00:22:12.10,"CHRISTY:  I don't know, she flipped out,"
536,00:22:13.50,00:22:13.50,and she just put the hand to my face.
537,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70,"And when somebody puts a hand in my face,"
538,00:22:18.03,00:22:18.03,"that really pissed me off,"
539,00:22:19.33,00:22:19.33, because I'm standing  right there.
540,00:22:21.27,00:22:21.27,"Man, if you are a ""vessel of Christ,"""
541,00:22:23.93,00:22:23.93,don't you think you need to be a little nicer or a little kinder?

543,00:22:29.63,00:22:29.63,-if I put that in your face? -But I wouldn't... I didn't
544,00:22:31.00,00:22:31.00,do anything for you to do that. I didn't come over here
545,00:22:32.53,00:22:32.53,and do anything for you to go... I didn't jump
546,00:22:34.37,00:22:34.37,"-in your conversation. -Well, obviously, I charged on over"
547,00:22:36.10,00:22:36.10,"-here to try to, like, you know? -To let you know."
548,00:22:37.83,00:22:37.83,"I mean, is it okay for me to express my feelings"
549,00:22:39.60,00:22:39.60,-with somebody? -But I thought you said you wanted to find
550,00:22:41.50,00:22:41.50,a way to let it go. If you're still expressing
551,00:22:43.27,00:22:43.27,"your feelings, that means it's not squashed."
552,00:22:44.60,00:22:44.60,"Well, I'm-I'm hurt, so I'm trying to get it out so I"
553,00:22:46.63,00:22:46.63,-can feel better. -You won't be hurt anymore if you don't
554,00:22:48.30,00:22:48.30,"come up into my face saying things that you say, okay?"
555,00:22:50.90,00:22:50.90,JOANNA: It wasn't  that I went over there to...
556,00:22:53.00,00:22:53.00," dog her out anymore, but I wanted her to know, don't think"
557,00:22:55.53,00:22:55.53,you're gonna around the tribe talking trash about me
558,00:22:57.80,00:22:57.80,because you got up in my business.
559,00:22:59.50,00:22:59.50,-That's your way of doing it. -Leave me alone.
560,00:23:00.77,00:23:00.77,-Okay. Okay. -And get out of my face.
561,00:23:07.10,00:23:07.10,JANET: I know.
562,00:23:08.43,00:23:08.43,-I know. -(Christy sighs)

568,00:23:38.37,00:23:38.37,"Should we? 'Cause, then, what if it rains when we're gone?"
569,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,Well...
570,00:23:44.00,00:23:44.00,What is that?
571,00:23:45.53,00:23:45.53,-Do you guys see what I see? -Mm-hmm. Yeah.
572,00:23:48.17,00:23:48.17,Whose is that?
573,00:23:49.90,00:23:49.90,Whose wrapper is that? Because that is not fair.
574,00:23:51.83,00:23:51.83,HEIDI: There's something in there
575,00:23:53.00,00:23:53.00,-that shouldn't be in there. -What?
576,00:23:54.57,00:23:54.57,Take a look.
577,00:23:55.73,00:23:55.73,I don't know whose it is.
578,00:23:57.23,00:23:57.23,"JANET: Oh, the food thing."
579,00:23:59.40,00:23:59.40,-Is that what you guys mean? -Yeah. Where'd it come from?
580,00:24:02.57,00:24:02.57,"Well, heck, I don't know."
581,00:24:04.40,00:24:04.40,"JENNA: We put all  of our stuff in the box,"
582,00:24:06.93,00:24:06.93," and we covered it up  'cause it was gonna rain,"
583,00:24:09.47,00:24:09.47, and we took all the packs out
584,00:24:11.27,00:24:11.27,and at the bottom there's a granola bar.
585,00:24:12.93,00:24:12.93,It was a wrapper-- I had no idea if it was empty or not.
586,00:24:15.97,00:24:15.97,-(several talking) -I think that somebody smuggled it.

798,00:32:54.03,00:32:54.03,"It took me, what, two hours?"
799,00:32:56.17,00:32:56.17,CHRISTY:  I think my tribe
800,00:32:58.20,00:32:58.20," is the most laziest tribe,"
801,00:32:59.77,00:32:59.77,the most laziest group I've ever been involved with.
802,00:33:02.43,00:33:02.43,"And it's, like, what do they expect out here?"
803,00:33:05.20,00:33:05.20," What do they...  I mean, some people are"
804,00:33:06.80,00:33:06.80," just slacking  and lying around, and..."
805,00:33:08.93,00:33:08.93,and it pisses me off.
806,00:33:11.27,00:33:11.27,CHRISTY: I want the shelter so bad.
807,00:33:13.73,00:33:13.73,Then I can just sit and chill like you guys.
808,00:33:17.47,00:33:17.47,DEENA: I took a break  from cutting down palm trees
809,00:33:20.73,00:33:20.73,"so that I could sleep on the bed,"
810,00:33:22.77,00:33:22.77,and Christy went off
811,00:33:25.03,00:33:25.03, on Jenna and Heidi  and Shawna and I.
812,00:33:26.87,00:33:26.87, That set me off a little bit.
813,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47," I didn't say anything to her,"
814,00:33:29.87,00:33:29.87,'cause it's not worth my time
815,00:33:30.97,00:33:30.97,"or my effort, so I just walked away."
816,00:33:32.37,00:33:32.37,"\xe2\x99\xaa We'll win, we'll win \xe2\x99\xaa"
817,00:33:34.63,00:33:34.63,-\xe2\x99\xaa We'll win \xe2\x99\xaa -\xe2\x99\xaa We'll work \xe2\x99\xaa

820,00:33:38.60,00:33:38.60,-\xe2\x99\xaa We'll win \xe2\x99\xaa -\xe2\x99\xaa Uh-huh \xe2\x99\xaa
821,00:33:40.07,00:33:40.07,\xe2\x99\xaa We'll complete our shelter \xe2\x99\xaa
822,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,\xe2\x99\xaa Before the judgment day. \xe2\x99\xaa
823,00:33:44.00,00:33:44.00,"Okay, there you go, Christy."
824,00:33:46.13,00:33:46.13,CHRISTY: What?
825,00:33:47.53,00:33:47.53,DEENA: Build away.
826,00:33:48.93,00:33:48.93,CHRISTY: I don't want to build.
827,00:33:50.40,00:33:50.40,-I want to go fishing. -JOANNA: See? See?
828,00:33:52.43,00:33:52.43,"-See what I'm talking about? -I don't know,"
829,00:33:54.37,00:33:54.37,I did that part. I didn't get any help.
830,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13,I don't feel like doing it today.
831,00:33:59.43,00:33:59.43,CHRISTY: I gave up  on working with the tribe.
832,00:34:01.73,00:34:01.73, I feel totally
833,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00," excluded from the tribe,  and so I realize"
834,00:34:06.00,00:34:06.00, I'm automatically rejected.
835,00:34:07.43,00:34:07.43," I mean, Jenna hasn't even said"
836,00:34:09.87,00:34:09.87,a word to me this whole five days.
837,00:34:13.07,00:34:13.07,"My pole is in the boat, and the bait is right there."
838,00:34:16.93,00:34:16.93,The small knife is over there.
839,00:34:18.87,00:34:18.87,"But I need somebody to go, so I'll wait, whenever..."
840,00:34:22.43,00:34:22.43,somebody wants to go.
841,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"It's okay, if you guys, if this is your priority"
842,00:34:26.27,00:34:26.27,"I'll join you guys, I'll help you guys."
843,00:34:27.77,00:34:27.77,I'd like it if all of us do it.
844,00:34:29.43,00:34:29.43,"But I do not want to be the only one building it, so..."
845,00:34:33.10,00:34:33.10,"Believe me, no one's shirkin', everyone's workin'."
846,00:34:36.93,00:34:36.93,"DEENA: If Christy gets voted out  tonight, it's gonna be because"
847,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77," of her personality  and her attitude, not anything"
848,00:34:42.47,00:34:42.47,to do with her handicap or her disability.
849,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"JANET: That ""Y"" is dead wood."
850,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,"-CHRISTY: No, it's not. -It isn't?"
851,00:34:48.53,00:34:48.53,"It's not. I swear to God,"
852,00:34:49.77,00:34:49.77,-I tried it. It'll hold on. -So it's sturdy enough?
853,00:34:51.93,00:34:51.93,-It worked fine. -All right.
854,00:34:53.47,00:34:53.47,JANET: Who I think  will go tonight will
855,00:34:55.27,00:34:55.27,either be me or Christy.
856,00:34:56.67,00:34:56.67,I... can't really know
857,00:34:59.70,00:34:59.70,until that moment which of us will go.
858,00:35:02.07,00:35:02.07,They're probably deciding that now.
859,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"Is everybody here? I want to say something,"
860,00:35:06.10,00:35:06.10,if everybody's here.
861,00:35:07.47,00:35:07.47,"You know, it's gotten around"
862,00:35:09.13,00:35:09.13,"that I'm the one that brought the... granola bar,"
863,00:35:13.73,00:35:13.73,"candy bar, whatever it was."
864,00:35:15.93,00:35:15.93,I don't know who smuggled it in...
865,00:35:17.97,00:35:17.97,but it wasn't me.
866,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,"So if you're gonna vote me out, that's fine,"
867,00:35:21.37,00:35:21.37,as long as it's not for that reason.
868,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00,"Because if it is, you're making a mistake."
869,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"JANET: Strategically, I probably  should vote for Christy,"
870,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63," but I think, instead,  I will vote"
871,00:35:32.43,00:35:32.43," for Jeanne,  because Jeanne is the one"
872,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,"that stirred up all of this, she's the one that"
873,00:35:36.10,00:35:36.10, first brought it up  and then went
874,00:35:37.37,00:35:37.37," around to people and said,  you know, ""I think Janet"
875,00:35:39.47,00:35:39.47,"smuggled in food."""
876,00:35:40.47,00:35:40.47,"I mean, she really basically stirred it all up."
877,00:35:49.63,00:35:49.63,(thunder rolling)
878,00:36:07.77,00:36:07.77,PROBST: Behind each of you guys
879,00:36:09.77,00:36:09.77,is a torch in your tribe color.
880,00:36:11.27,00:36:11.27,"Grab a torch,"
881,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60,"approach a flame, dip it and get fire."
882,00:36:16.77,00:36:16.77,"This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council,"
883,00:36:19.77,00:36:19.77,"because at Tribal Council, fire represents life."
884,00:36:22.77,00:36:22.77,"As long as you have fire, you're in the game."
885,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"When your fire's out, so are you."
886,00:36:26.77,00:36:26.77,And then put the torches back in their slots
887,00:36:28.63,00:36:28.63,and have a seat.
888,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"So, let's talk about the first six days."
889,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,"Who's emerging right now, Janet?"
890,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,Is there somebody you look to for certain things?
891,00:36:43.33,00:36:43.33,Or maybe somebody else for other skills?
892,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,"Well, Joanna's an extremely strong woman,"
893,00:36:48.83,00:36:48.83,"incredible strength, and we really, really relied on her,"
894,00:36:52.57,00:36:52.57,"and Deena both, I, you know, I think"
895,00:36:54.33,00:36:54.33,really... did an incredible amount of chopping
896,00:36:57.80,00:36:57.80,"and, you know, just the really heavy labor,"
897,00:37:00.30,00:37:00.30,because they're just really strong women.
898,00:37:02.40,00:37:02.40,"Deena, you guys have certain things"
899,00:37:04.70,00:37:04.70,you have to accomplish at a camp.
900,00:37:06.43,00:37:06.43,"You got to build shelter,"
901,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60,"you got to get fire, you got to find water."
902,00:37:09.43,00:37:09.43,Take me through the shelter.
903,00:37:11.60,00:37:11.60,We have none.
904,00:37:13.13,00:37:13.13,It's... sort of completed.
905,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,"But it's not really a shelter,"
906,00:37:17.00,00:37:17.00,it's kind of a mishmosh of hodgepodge of... of a mess.
907,00:37:20.80,00:37:20.80,You have to factor in the elements.
908,00:37:22.57,00:37:22.57,"We have a lot of downpours here,"
909,00:37:24.47,00:37:24.47,and then there is the traipsing out to find the right materials.
910,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,"JOANNA: We can't say, oh, we're just gonna take all day"
911,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,and build a shelter and we don't have any water.
912,00:37:32.50,00:37:32.50,We can't say we're gonna take all day and build a shelter and
913,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,"we don't have a fire to boil the water,"
914,00:37:36.47,00:37:36.47,"'cause if we can't have a fire, we can't boil water to drink."
915,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,And then we're gonna die.
916,00:37:40.03,00:37:40.03,"PROBST: What I'm getting at is,"
917,00:37:41.53,00:37:41.53,it doesn't sound like you have any plan.
918,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"Christy, is there anything"
919,00:37:46.53,00:37:46.53,that's not being done at camp that you could do better?
920,00:37:49.47,00:37:49.47,The shelter. The shelter.
921,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,I think the shelter should have been built days ago.
922,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,"-Joanna, you're shaking your head no, no, no. -No, because"
923,00:37:58.57,00:37:58.57,"after we came back with the palm fronds,"
924,00:38:00.13,00:38:00.13,"somebody asked her about completing the shelter, and she"
925,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,"-was, like, ""No, I wanna go fishing."" -Well, that was today,"
926,00:38:04.53,00:38:04.53,"because I work hard, there are people"
927,00:38:06.03,00:38:06.03,"sitting down, doing nothing,"
928,00:38:07.63,00:38:07.63,"and here I am, trying to put a shelter together"
929,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,"and I get no help, no support."
930,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,"I asked questions, I got no answer."
931,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,"So I felt very, like, so you want me to help you now?"
932,00:38:17.03,00:38:17.03,PROBST: Do you feel excluded?
933,00:38:19.17,00:38:19.17,-Yes. -Do you think
934,00:38:21.03,00:38:21.03,it has to do with
935,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,-that you're deaf? -Yes.
936,00:38:24.03,00:38:24.03,No question?
937,00:38:25.03,00:38:25.03,(choked up): No question.
938,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57,PROBST: What's a sign of that?
939,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,When...
940,00:38:30.57,00:38:30.57,"there's something important going on,"
941,00:38:32.63,00:38:32.63,I'm not... I have no idea what's going on.
942,00:38:35.03,00:38:35.03,I don't know when I need to join the group.
943,00:38:37.70,00:38:37.70,"I... um, every time I'm there, people just..."
944,00:38:39.73,00:38:39.73,"move away, or they just... they don't include me."
945,00:38:44.57,00:38:44.57,"I work harder than them,"
946,00:38:47.23,00:38:47.23,and I don't feel like they're working...
947,00:38:49.73,00:38:49.73,And it just makes it harder when your team doesn't accept you.
948,00:38:53.70,00:38:53.70,"PROBST: Janet, body language is"
949,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,-telling me everything. -I-I just find it
950,00:38:57.13,00:38:57.13,insulting for someone to say that we sit around.
951,00:39:00.33,00:39:00.33,"Let me ask you, then-- what do you think about"
952,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,the notion that Christy is being excluded on purpose?
953,00:39:07.93,00:39:07.93,I think that's also ridiculous.
954,00:39:09.23,00:39:09.23,It's not... we don't exclude anybody.
955,00:39:12.30,00:39:12.30,"We're women living together in the jungle,"
956,00:39:14.70,00:39:14.70,trying to survive without food and water.
957,00:39:17.17,00:39:17.17,"So eventually, reactions are gonna happen."
958,00:39:22.53,00:39:22.53,It is time to vote.
959,00:39:24.00,00:39:24.00,"Heidi, you're up."
960,00:39:36.37,00:39:36.37,"Janet, I'm voting for you,"
961,00:39:38.40,00:39:38.40,because I know you want out of here.
962,00:39:40.77,00:39:40.77," You were sick at first, and  it's really hard to catch up."
963,00:39:55.23,00:39:55.23,"I understand we need physical strength,"
964,00:39:58.13,00:39:58.13,but your attitude stinks.
965,00:40:24.03,00:40:24.03,My vote is for Jeanne.
966,00:40:26.03,00:40:26.03,"You've got incredible strength,"
967,00:40:28.80,00:40:28.80," you're just nonstop, but you're just too aggressive."
968,00:40:54.80,00:40:54.80,I'll go tally the votes.
969,00:41:03.93,00:41:03.93,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
970,00:41:06.23,00:41:06.23,The person voted out'll be asked to leave
971,00:41:08.30,00:41:08.30,the Tribal Council area immediately.
972,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,I'll read the votes.
973,00:41:14.53,00:41:14.53,First vote...
974,00:41:17.33,00:41:17.33,Jenna.
975,00:41:22.83,00:41:22.83,Janet.
976,00:41:29.17,00:41:29.17,Christy.
977,00:41:33.47,00:41:33.47,Jeanne.
978,00:41:35.10,00:41:35.10,"That's one vote Jeanne, one vote Janet,"
979,00:41:37.50,00:41:37.50,"one vote Christy, one vote Jenna."
980,00:41:44.43,00:41:44.43,Janet.
981,00:41:45.93,00:41:45.93,Two votes Janet.
982,00:41:50.20,00:41:50.20,Three votes Janet.
983,00:41:56.77,00:41:56.77,First person voted out of Jaburu...
984,00:42:00.10,00:42:00.10,"Janet. That's four, and that's enough."
985,00:42:01.90,00:42:01.90,The last vote will remain a mystery.
986,00:42:03.83,00:42:03.83,You need to bring me your torch.
987,00:42:14.90,00:42:14.90,"Janet, the tribe has spoken."
988,00:42:20.43,00:42:20.43,It's time for you to go.
989,00:42:22.67,00:42:22.67,"Good luck, guys."
990,00:42:31.07,00:42:31.07,I hope tomorrow morning brings
