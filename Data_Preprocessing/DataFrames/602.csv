1,00:00:01.57,00:00:01.57,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:02.87,00:00:02.87, 16 strangers were abandoned
3,00:00:04.80,00:00:04.80, deep in the heart of the Amazon jungle.
4,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67," For the first time, the tribes"
5,00:00:09.57,00:00:09.57, were divided into men and women.
6,00:00:11.63,00:00:11.63,This place was discoveredin 1541-- Spanish explorer.
7,00:00:15.23,00:00:15.23,He encounters a tribeof very fierce female warriors.
8,00:00:18.07,00:00:18.07,This was the first notion
9,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,that women could survivejust fine on their own.
10,00:00:22.07,00:00:22.07,"That is where the term""Amazon women"" comes from."
11,00:00:24.90,00:00:24.90,(cheering)
12,00:00:26.07,00:00:26.07,Shove off!
13,00:00:27.33,00:00:27.33," From the start, the women had trouble."
14,00:00:29.57,00:00:29.57,"SHAWNA: I just felt so stupid, with the guys going off"
15,00:00:31.80,00:00:31.80," one way, the girls couldn't untie..."
16,00:00:33.07,00:00:33.07,"well, I couldn'tuntie the knot."
17,00:00:34.80,00:00:34.80,PROBST: When the Jaburu women finally arrived at camp...
18,00:00:37.03,00:00:37.03,(whooping)
19,00:00:38.80,00:00:38.80,...Christy revealed her secret.
20,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,And every tribe membershould know that I am deaf.
21,00:00:43.70,00:00:43.70,JENNA: I'm wondering how she's going to be able
22,00:00:45.07,00:00:45.07, to work with the group when she can't
23,00:00:46.73,00:00:46.73,"-really hear well.-PROBST: From the beginning,"
24,00:00:48.67,00:00:48.67, some of the women found surviving in the Amazon
25,00:00:52.23,00:00:52.23, tougher than they ever imagined.
26,00:00:53.87,00:00:53.87,I don't know if I can doa challenge tomorrow.
27,00:00:56.07,00:00:56.07,I'm having trouble walking.
28,00:00:57.40,00:00:57.40,PROBST: They didn't catch many fish.
29,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,HEIDI: I was pretty sure
30,00:01:00.70,00:01:00.70," that after you gutted the thing,"
31,00:01:02.17,00:01:02.17, there would've been... there's just
32,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,nothing even left.
33,00:01:04.40,00:01:04.40,I feel like I'm eatingvomit right now.
34,00:01:05.97,00:01:05.97,PROBST: And they had trouble building shelter.
35,00:01:07.87,00:01:07.87,"-Oh, my God!-(screams)"
36,00:01:10.23,00:01:10.23,"PROBST: At Tambaqui, things were different."
37,00:01:12.00,00:01:12.00,ALL:Tambaqui!
38,00:01:13.97,00:01:13.97,PROBST:The guys finished their shelter
39,00:01:15.80,00:01:15.80, under Roger's self-proclaimed leadership.
40,00:01:17.80,00:01:17.80,We need them about threefeet long-- the Y's--
41,00:01:20.03,00:01:20.03,"and there should beplenty of them, okay?"
42,00:01:22.20,00:01:22.20,"ROB: I know how to play this game. I say, ""Yes, Roger."
43,00:01:24.40,00:01:24.40,"Yes, Roger. Sure, Roger."""
44,00:01:25.87,00:01:25.87,PROBST: And the tribe felt confident.
45,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,"Yo, we're the favoritesright now."
46,00:01:28.73,00:01:28.73,"RYAN: Bottom line is,"
47,00:01:29.93,00:01:29.93," a lot of girls over there are eye candy,"
48,00:01:32.03,00:01:32.03," but when it comes down to it,"
49,00:01:33.60,00:01:33.60,you want peoplethat are going to be useful.
50,00:01:35.37,00:01:35.37,Survivors ready? Go!
51,00:01:37.23,00:01:37.23," At the first immunity challenge, the Tambaqui men"
52,00:01:39.53,00:01:39.53, quickly jumped ahead.
53,00:01:40.70,00:01:40.70,You're good.Feet can't touch! No!
54,00:01:43.20,00:01:43.20,"Daniel and Ryan,got to head back."
55,00:01:45.10,00:01:45.10, But Ryan and Daniel blew the men's lead.
56,00:01:47.67,00:01:47.67,Hug the log!
57,00:01:49.07,00:01:49.07, And Heidi led the women to victory.
58,00:01:51.53,00:01:51.53,Jaburu wins immunity!
59,00:01:53.47,00:01:53.47," Tambaqui went to Tribal Council,"
60,00:01:55.80,00:01:55.80,where Ryan was the first person
61,00:01:57.80,00:01:57.80, voted out of the tribe.
62,00:01:59.07,00:01:59.07,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
63,00:02:03.53,00:02:03.53, 15 remain.
64,00:02:05.07,00:02:05.07, Who will be voted out tonight?
65,00:03:31.90,00:03:31.90,JANET: We've been sleeping in the elements
66,00:03:34.70,00:03:34.70, for four nights now.
67,00:03:36.50,00:03:36.50," The shelter that we have does not, you know,"
68,00:03:39.00,00:03:39.00,live up to its name.
69,00:03:40.17,00:03:40.17,It does not shelter us.
70,00:03:40.93,00:03:40.93,Look at it. It goes...(makes high-pitched noise)
71,00:03:42.87,00:03:42.87,It's-it's narrower over hereand wider over here.
72,00:03:44.70,00:03:44.70,-Mm-hmm.-SHAWNA: What we wanted do there
73,00:03:46.83,00:03:46.83,was reinforce the centerbecause it's breaking.
74,00:03:49.40,00:03:49.40,HEIDI: There's not a roof over our heads
75,00:03:52.30,00:03:52.30, because there's so many other priorities going on.
76,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93," Like, number one is water."
77,00:03:57.53,00:03:57.53, Everybody's energy is being in that fire and water.
78,00:04:01.63,00:04:01.63," Water, fire, water, fire. I mean, we just..."
79,00:04:03.87,00:04:03.87,it takes everyone's energyjust to do that.
80,00:04:06.00,00:04:06.00,DEENA:We need to designate.
81,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,"We need one personon fire, water, logs."
82,00:04:10.20,00:04:10.20,"JEANNE: Okay, one person--fire, water, logs."
83,00:04:12.17,00:04:12.17,Who's going to do that?
84,00:04:14.00,00:04:14.00,"JEANNE: Our camp is so disorganized,"
85,00:04:16.27,00:04:16.27,because we don't have a leader.
86,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07, You really need to bring it together and unify it
87,00:04:20.90,00:04:20.90,"and work as a team,and without a leader,"
88,00:04:22.87,00:04:22.87,we're not going to get ittogether.
89,00:04:24.43,00:04:24.43,"See, since we are not usingthis section, are we, like..."
90,00:04:28.03,00:04:28.03,"I mean, do we want to tryto go, like, tepee style?"
91,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,I really don't care if wehave a high ceiling or not.
92,00:04:33.00,00:04:33.00,"-I don't care, either.-I don't know."
93,00:04:34.30,00:04:34.30,I think those poles are fine.
94,00:04:35.80,00:04:35.80,So A-frame could bethe way to go.
95,00:04:38.23,00:04:38.23,SHAWNA: We don't have the necessary stuff
96,00:04:39.80,00:04:39.80, to survive right now.
97,00:04:41.10,00:04:41.10, We are not surviving.
98,00:04:42.93,00:04:42.93, I think the guys are much better off than us.
99,00:04:45.23,00:04:45.23, I have no doubt that
100,00:04:46.90,00:04:46.90,they probably had their stufftogether before we did.
101,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,"Guys, this looks delicious."
102,00:05:05.93,00:05:05.93,"ALEX: Here we are in the Amazon, in this rain forest,"
103,00:05:09.80,00:05:09.80," and we've built our shelter, we're making do with our food."
104,00:05:13.83,00:05:13.83,We did finally figure out
105,00:05:15.03,00:05:15.03,"how to use the manioc flour,instead of just"
106,00:05:16.83,00:05:16.83," eating it dry, which was nice."
107,00:05:18.67,00:05:18.67,"MATTHEW:Hotcakes are on, boys!"
108,00:05:20.77,00:05:20.77,ALEX:  We're surviving.
109,00:05:22.53,00:05:22.53,"Not the Ritz,but it's... it's pretty cool."
110,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,"It's hot, guys. You have tobalance it in your hands."
111,00:05:29.43,00:05:29.43,What a bunchof lamebrains we are.
112,00:05:30.90,00:05:30.90,This is the way to do it.
113,00:05:32.33,00:05:32.33,It's filling.
114,00:05:33.63,00:05:33.63,"It's filling,and it tastes average."
115,00:05:35.50,00:05:35.50,It's great.
116,00:05:36.67,00:05:36.67,All right.We going to fish?
117,00:05:38.93,00:05:38.93,Let's fish.
118,00:05:40.13,00:05:40.13,-Here we go.-Here we go.
119,00:05:44.43,00:05:44.43,"All right, ready?"
120,00:05:45.77,00:05:45.77,"Yeah, here we go, guys--right side."
121,00:05:47.97,00:05:47.97,Easy on the left side.
122,00:05:49.83,00:05:49.83,"Good job, guys."
123,00:05:51.93,00:05:51.93,ROGER: The last few days here
124,00:05:53.77,00:05:53.77, have been a little embarrassing.
125,00:05:55.77,00:05:55.77," Uh, we lost the first immunity challenge,"
126,00:05:57.60,00:05:57.60, but we've established
127,00:05:58.77,00:05:58.77,a... a very good team.
128,00:06:01.13,00:06:01.13,"All right, everybody ready?"
129,00:06:02.60,00:06:02.60,"One, two, three."
130,00:06:04.93,00:06:04.93,That was a good one.
131,00:06:06.27,00:06:06.27,"-Yeah, nice cast.-Coordinated effort."
132,00:06:08.47,00:06:08.47,DAVE: I think what we're doing is really settling down
133,00:06:11.23,00:06:11.23,to a schedule.
134,00:06:12.40,00:06:12.40,We... we got our shelter built.Uh... we're
135,00:06:14.57,00:06:14.57," assessing our food.You know, what do we need to do"
136,00:06:16.73,00:06:16.73, in order to sustain ourselves for the long haul?
137,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27,"BUTCH: One, two, guys,we're getting her down."
138,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,It's going to take a while.
139,00:06:23.40,00:06:23.40,"One, two, three."
140,00:06:29.87,00:06:29.87,(thunder crashing)
141,00:06:34.77,00:06:34.77,They look pretty angry.
142,00:06:36.83,00:06:36.83,Getting a little concerned?
143,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67,"-Want to go back to camp, guys?-You can hear it. -Yeah."
144,00:06:40.97,00:06:40.97,"All right, Tambaqui, let's get"
145,00:06:42.23,00:06:42.23,-on the move.-Let's go.
146,00:06:43.60,00:06:43.60,"One, two, three."
147,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97,Wind's to our back.
148,00:06:47.27,00:06:47.27,It was so sunny a minute ago.
149,00:06:49.77,00:06:49.77,"DAVE: Not seconds before we got back, it..."
150,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,it just dumped.It rained hard.
151,00:06:54.47,00:06:54.47,(thunder crashing)
152,00:06:57.30,00:06:57.30,(whooping)
153,00:06:59.50,00:06:59.50,ALEX: It came down in buckets.
154,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70," But inside the shelter,"
155,00:07:06.03,00:07:06.03, there were a couple of drips here and there;
156,00:07:07.90,00:07:07.90,"pretty much, we were dry."
157,00:07:11.27,00:07:11.27,It'd suck to be outsideright now.
158,00:07:14.07,00:07:14.07,(thunder crashing)
159,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,Have a seat near the fire.
160,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,I am so cold right now.
161,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,Right now... a
162,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,"ridiculous,horrendous storm just hit us,"
163,00:07:44.73,00:07:44.73,and we're getting buckets...buckets of water on us.
164,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,The ground's fallen through.
165,00:07:49.90,00:07:49.90,Our... our stakes are flimsy.
166,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53,"We didn't get our structure upin time, so we are wet."
167,00:07:55.87,00:07:55.87,"We lost our flint,so we can't rebuild a fire."
168,00:07:59.03,00:07:59.03,"So, right now, we're focusingon the fire shelter."
169,00:08:02.23,00:08:02.23,"And, um, these palmsare... are crap,"
170,00:08:05.53,00:08:05.53,so we're trying to figure outhow to weave them together
171,00:08:07.80,00:08:07.80,"to ensure that that thingdoesn't go out,"
172,00:08:09.50,00:08:09.50,"'cause that's our lifeline,"
173,00:08:10.97,00:08:10.97,and serious troubleif that gets hit.
174,00:08:13.87,00:08:13.87,I can't believehow badly this sucks.
175,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,We thought we'd havemore time than this.
176,00:08:19.43,00:08:19.43,"Forgot that we're inthe middle of the Amazon,"
177,00:08:21.50,00:08:21.50,and that torrential rainstormscome by daily.
178,00:08:43.70,00:08:43.70,"Okay, it is your firstreward challenge."
179,00:08:47.77,00:08:47.77,"Today, we're going to testhow well you communicate."
180,00:08:50.43,00:08:50.43,Your ability to listento each other and take direction
181,00:08:52.93,00:08:52.93,will determine the outcome.
182,00:08:54.37,00:08:54.37," It'll consist of a puzzle,"
183,00:08:55.73,00:08:55.73, which will demand teamwork to build. The 30 pieces
184,00:08:58.60,00:08:58.60,required
185,00:08:59.50,00:08:59.50, to solve your puzzle
186,00:09:00.73,00:09:00.73, have been scattered in the jungle clearing.
187,00:09:02.40,00:09:02.40, You're going to pick
188,00:09:03.40,00:09:03.40,one tribe member.
189,00:09:04.93,00:09:04.93,They're going to be your guide.
190,00:09:06.33,00:09:06.33,The other tribe memberswill be blindfolded in pairs.
191,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,The guidewill navigate the pairs
192,00:09:12.03,00:09:12.03," through the clearing, which has trees and logs"
193,00:09:15.13,00:09:15.13," and mud, as you gather the pieces."
194,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,"Once you've gatheredall 30 pieces,"
195,00:09:19.77,00:09:19.77,you can take your blindfolds off
196,00:09:21.30,00:09:21.30,and start to putthe puzzle together.
197,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,First tribe to completethe puzzle wins reward.
198,00:09:25.87,00:09:25.87,Want to knowwhat you're playing for?
199,00:09:27.33,00:09:27.33,"-Yeah.-Well, the river"
200,00:09:28.50,00:09:28.50,is a source of a lot of food.
201,00:09:30.93,00:09:30.93,"Outside of bothyour guys' camps,"
202,00:09:32.43,00:09:32.43,"there really are fish this big,"
203,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,and the best wayto catch them: fish bait.
204,00:09:36.43,00:09:36.43,"-Oh.-Oh, yeah."

323,00:14:07.90,00:14:07.90,"And, particularly,"
324,00:14:09.67,00:14:09.67,seven guys don't want to loseto a bunch of girls.

334,00:14:28.63,00:14:28.63,Bait would have been nice.
335,00:14:29.97,00:14:29.97,"DAVE: I think, you know,we got an immunity challenge,"

340,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33,"and work on it as a team,we'll be all right."
341,00:14:57.73,00:14:57.73,Good batch.
342,00:14:59.20,00:14:59.20,JEANNE:Is it?
343,00:15:00.60,00:15:00.60,"Mmm, mmm!"
344,00:15:01.83,00:15:01.83,That tasted like you put
345,00:15:03.13,00:15:03.13,some beautiful spicesin it today.
346,00:15:04.87,00:15:04.87,"HEIDI: 'Cause I did try to burnit a little bit more,"
347,00:15:07.17,00:15:07.17,since it was wet in there.
348,00:15:08.53,00:15:08.53,JEANNE: We need food-- real food.
349,00:15:10.03,00:15:10.03, The manioc--

351,00:15:13.23,00:15:13.23,burnt manioc--was just no good.
352,00:15:15.13,00:15:15.13,"-Oh, it's disgusting.-Yeah, it really is."
353,00:15:17.10,00:15:17.10,It's got maggotsjust everywhere in there.
354,00:15:18.80,00:15:18.80,Aah! I didn't knowabout the maggots.
355,00:15:20.73,00:15:20.73,"-Oh, yeah.-Oh..."
356,00:15:23.23,00:15:23.23,I did not know about them.
357,00:15:27.23,00:15:27.23,"JANET: Mentally, I can handle this game great,"
358,00:15:29.70,00:15:29.70," but physically,"
359,00:15:31.20,00:15:31.20,"it's really, you know,taking its toll,"
360,00:15:33.60,00:15:33.60,and it's so much tougherthan I thought.
361,00:15:35.47,00:15:35.47,-I just wish we couldcatch some fish. -I know.
362,00:15:37.53,00:15:37.53,Did you get any nibbles?

366,00:15:43.77,00:15:43.77, Barely anything to eat.
367,00:15:46.00,00:15:46.00,"But, for the challenges,I mean, so far,"
368,00:15:47.70,00:15:47.70,we've... we've done really well.
369,00:15:48.90,00:15:48.90,"We've won them bothover the guys,"
370,00:15:50.63,00:15:50.63,who are very cockyand think that they...
371,00:15:52.30,00:15:52.30,they were going to beat usboth times.
372,00:15:57.33,00:15:57.33,"JEANNE:My fishing technique is,"
373,00:15:59.07,00:15:59.07,put the bait on the hookand pray.
374,00:16:02.33,00:16:02.33, We've had a few problems fishing.
375,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33, Nothing was really biting out here.
376,00:16:06.37,00:16:06.37,"This stuff is tough,whatever this is."
377,00:16:09.23,00:16:09.23, And you can see them. They're all around you.
378,00:16:10.87,00:16:10.87, They're jumping.
379,00:16:12.43,00:16:12.43,"Come on, fishies."

386,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33," Need a little time and a little patience,"
387,00:16:33.60,00:16:33.60,but I feel betterabout the future
388,00:16:35.50,00:16:35.50,"because now we have the bait,and I know how to fish,"
389,00:16:38.43,00:16:38.43,and it's going to be okay.
390,00:16:48.17,00:16:48.17,ALEX: My trouble is people who tell other people how to live.
391,00:16:51.17,00:16:51.17,-I'm doing okay so far. -As longas you're not hurting...

395,00:16:56.93,00:16:56.93,-that's all fine and well.-Mm-hmm.
396,00:16:58.27,00:16:58.27,It's just like the gay issue.
397,00:16:59.83,00:16:59.83,"I mean, it doesn't matter to me."
398,00:17:02.00,00:17:02.00,ROB: I was really stumped on who I could get
399,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,"that might vote against Roger,up until this morning,"
400,00:17:08.73,00:17:08.73,when a lightbulbwent off in my head.
401,00:17:10.80,00:17:10.80,"As long as they don'tbother me, I don't give a damn."
402,00:17:13.77,00:17:13.77,"I don't like to see themflaunting it, though."
403,00:17:16.67,00:17:16.67,"-I mean, that...-Really?"
404,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,You like to see two guysout on the street...
405,00:17:20.30,00:17:20.30,-Doesn't bother me at all.-...making out and all that?
406,00:17:22.17,00:17:22.17,-I don't care.-It doesn't bother you at all?
407,00:17:23.53,00:17:23.53,No. Could care less.
408,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,Alex and Roger had
409,00:17:26.53,00:17:26.53,a little bitof a tiff this morning
410,00:17:28.67,00:17:28.67, -over homosexuality. -You don't know!
411,00:17:30.23,00:17:30.23,"You've never beenin the situation, and you're..."
412,00:17:31.87,00:17:31.87,"Alex, that is not natural."
413,00:17:33.93,00:17:33.93,-Period. -Who said...who said anything about natural?
414,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,"ALEX: First of all, I'm straight, so I don't know"
415,00:17:37.90,00:17:37.90,"what it is to be homosexual,"
416,00:17:39.37,00:17:39.37,"and Roger is straight,so he doesn't know, either."
417,00:17:41.60,00:17:41.60," What it comes down to is, if it's what makes you happy"
418,00:17:45.23,00:17:45.23," and if it's not hurting anybody,"
419,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,then who cares?
420,00:17:49.40,00:17:49.40,The sex part of it that goeswith the male and the woman...
421,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,-Mm-hmm.-...is to procreate.
422,00:17:53.57,00:17:53.57,-Yeah. So you're only...-It's an expression...
423,00:17:55.10,00:17:55.10,"So what you're saying is,you've only had sex two times--"
424,00:17:57.33,00:17:57.33,"the two times you wantedto procreate, that was"
425,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,-the only times you've had sexwith your wife? -No. No.
426,00:18:01.40,00:18:01.40,"Okay, then itwasn't about procreation."
427,00:18:02.90,00:18:02.90,"-It wasn't. Sorry. -ROB: Now, what I'm hoping is that"
428,00:18:05.53,00:18:05.53,this has planted the seedin Al... in Alex's head
429,00:18:08.63,00:18:08.63, that Roger may not be all he's cracked up to be.
430,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,Roger is a bigot.
431,00:18:13.23,00:18:13.23,You tell me why it is not wrong.
432,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,-I'll tell you whyit's not wrong. -Okay.
433,00:18:16.37,00:18:16.37,Because I know peoplewho live their life
434,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,"for a long timebeing ""straight,"""
435,00:18:21.33,00:18:21.33,and they came out of the closetand have had more love

437,00:18:27.73,00:18:27.73,-and being true to themselves...-Mm-hmm.
438,00:18:29.37,00:18:29.37,...than they everwould have living a lie.
439,00:18:31.00,00:18:31.00,-Mm-hmm.-That's why it's okay.
440,00:18:32.87,00:18:32.87,-That makes it okay?-Absolutely.
441,00:18:35.13,00:18:35.13,"ROGER: You have your opinion,and I have mine."
442,00:18:37.70,00:18:37.70,"-Okay.-And you can't convince me,"
443,00:18:39.67,00:18:39.67,-and I can't convince you.-I don't want to convince you.
444,00:18:42.40,00:18:42.40,I have no desireto convince you at all.

448,00:19:06.53,00:19:06.53,"DEENA: And when it gets dark in the Amazon,"
449,00:19:08.87,00:19:08.87, it's not like dark in the city.
450,00:19:11.37,00:19:11.37,It's you can't seewhere you're going.
451,00:19:14.13,00:19:14.13, You can't see in front of you.
452,00:19:16.53,00:19:16.53, So our fire is our life.
453,00:19:18.07,00:19:18.07, And...
454,00:19:19.23,00:19:19.23, half of the tribe went nutty.
455,00:19:21.40,00:19:21.40,(thunder crashing)
456,00:19:25.33,00:19:25.33,"JOANNA: What the Devil meant forevil, God done turned into good."

462,00:19:39.33,00:19:39.33,I'm not touching it.
463,00:19:40.70,00:19:40.70,DEENA: Joanna doesn't like the immunity idol
464,00:19:42.87,00:19:42.87," because she thinks that it is an idol,"
465,00:19:44.37,00:19:44.37, and idols are...
466,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57," forbidden via the Ten Commandments, right?"
467,00:19:48.43,00:19:48.43," ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me."""
468,00:19:50.57,00:19:50.57, She didn't want it in the camp at all.
469,00:19:53.03,00:19:53.03," She didn't want to touch it, she doesn't want to hold it."
470,00:19:54.57,00:19:54.57,She wants nothing to do with it.

472,00:19:57.33,00:19:57.33,JEANNE: Why can't you look at itas a symbol instead of an idol?
473,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,JOANNA: Because it's not-- it'scalled an idol for a reason.
474,00:20:03.70,00:20:03.70,"-Well, why don't you changethe name? -It's almost like..."
475,00:20:05.93,00:20:05.93,"-No, I can't do that.-But it meant..."
476,00:20:07.67,00:20:07.67,it meant that we were unifiedand we...
477,00:20:08.97,00:20:08.97,"JOANNA:No, you don't understand."
478,00:20:11.07,00:20:11.07," You know, some people worship Buddha,"
479,00:20:12.43,00:20:12.43, and some people do that or whatever.
480,00:20:13.73,00:20:13.73," I worship the most high El Elyon God,"
481,00:20:16.70,00:20:16.70," Jehovah Jireh, El Shaddai, and he"
482,00:20:18.93,00:20:18.93,despises idol worship.
483,00:20:20.27,00:20:20.27,"You... if you read the OldTestament, they got struck down,"
484,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03,"and that's why wegot rained on last night,"
485,00:20:25.27,00:20:25.27,bringing the idolinto our... our tribe.
486,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,That idol is the reasonwhy we're all here right now.
487,00:20:30.40,00:20:30.40,JOANNA: That idol's notthe reason we're here.
488,00:20:31.77,00:20:31.77,We won beforewe even had the idol.
489,00:20:33.47,00:20:33.47,"As soon as we lose,we lose the idol,"
490,00:20:35.27,00:20:35.27,"so if that idol is our friend,"
491,00:20:36.63,00:20:36.63,why isn't he with uswhen we were doing bad?

511,00:21:27.53,00:21:27.53,'cause you can't... yeah.
512,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,JEANNE: Christy had asked me
513,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,"what we talk about at night,and if I could fill her in,"
514,00:21:34.53,00:21:34.53," so I said, ""You know what, I just want to let you know"

803,00:33:06.80,00:33:06.80," just slacking and lying around, and..."
804,00:33:08.93,00:33:08.93,and it pisses me off.
805,00:33:11.27,00:33:11.27,CHRISTY:I want the shelter so bad.
806,00:33:13.73,00:33:13.73,Then I can just sit and chilllike you guys.
807,00:33:17.47,00:33:17.47,DEENA: I took a break from cutting down palm trees
808,00:33:20.73,00:33:20.73,"so that I could sleepon the bed,"
809,00:33:22.77,00:33:22.77,and Christy went off
810,00:33:25.03,00:33:25.03, on Jenna and Heidi and Shawna and I.
811,00:33:26.87,00:33:26.87, That set me off a little bit.
812,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47," I didn't say anything to her,"
813,00:33:29.87,00:33:29.87,'cause it's not worth my time
814,00:33:30.97,00:33:30.97,"or my effort,so I just walked away."

823,00:33:46.13,00:33:46.13,CHRISTY:What?
824,00:33:47.53,00:33:47.53,DEENA:Build away.
825,00:33:48.93,00:33:48.93,CHRISTY:I don't want to build.
826,00:33:50.40,00:33:50.40,-I want to go fishing.-JOANNA: See? See?
827,00:33:52.43,00:33:52.43,"-See what I'm talking about?-I don't know,"
828,00:33:54.37,00:33:54.37,I did that part.I didn't get any help.
829,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13,I don't feellike doing it today.
830,00:33:59.43,00:33:59.43,CHRISTY: I gave up on working with the tribe.
831,00:34:01.73,00:34:01.73, I feel totally
832,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00," excluded from the tribe, and so I realize"
833,00:34:06.00,00:34:06.00, I'm automatically rejected.
834,00:34:07.43,00:34:07.43," I mean, Jenna hasn't even said"
835,00:34:09.87,00:34:09.87,a word to methis whole five days.
836,00:34:13.07,00:34:13.07,"My pole is in the boat,and the bait is right there."
837,00:34:16.93,00:34:16.93,The small knife is over there.
838,00:34:18.87,00:34:18.87,"But I need somebody to go,so I'll wait, whenever..."
839,00:34:22.43,00:34:22.43,somebody wants to go.
840,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"It's okay, if you guys,if this is your priority"
841,00:34:26.27,00:34:26.27,"I'll join you guys,I'll help you guys."
842,00:34:27.77,00:34:27.77,I'd like it if all of us do it.
843,00:34:29.43,00:34:29.43,"But I do not want to bethe only one building it, so..."
844,00:34:33.10,00:34:33.10,"Believe me, no one's shirkin',everyone's workin'."
845,00:34:36.93,00:34:36.93,"DEENA: If Christy gets voted out tonight, it's gonna be because"
846,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77," of her personality and her attitude, not anything"
847,00:34:42.47,00:34:42.47,to do with her handicapor her disability.
848,00:34:44.83,00:34:44.83,"JANET:That ""Y"" is dead wood."
849,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,"-CHRISTY: No, it's not.-It isn't?"
850,00:34:48.53,00:34:48.53,"It's not. I swear to God,"
851,00:34:49.77,00:34:49.77,-I tried it. It'll hold on.-So it's sturdy enough?
852,00:34:51.93,00:34:51.93,-It worked fine.-All right.
853,00:34:53.47,00:34:53.47,JANET: Who I think will go tonight will
854,00:34:55.27,00:34:55.27,either be me or Christy.
855,00:34:56.67,00:34:56.67,I... can't really know
856,00:34:59.70,00:34:59.70,until that momentwhich of us will go.
857,00:35:02.07,00:35:02.07,They're probablydeciding that now.
858,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"Is everybody here?I want to say something,"
859,00:35:06.10,00:35:06.10,if everybody's here.
860,00:35:07.47,00:35:07.47,"You know, it's gotten around"
861,00:35:09.13,00:35:09.13,"that I'm the one thatbrought the... granola bar,"
862,00:35:13.73,00:35:13.73,"candy bar, whatever it was."
863,00:35:15.93,00:35:15.93,I don't knowwho smuggled it in...
864,00:35:17.97,00:35:17.97,but it wasn't me.
865,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,"So if you're gonnavote me out, that's fine,"
866,00:35:21.37,00:35:21.37,as long as it'snot for that reason.
867,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00,"Because if it is,you're making a mistake."
868,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"JANET: Strategically, I probably should vote for Christy,"
869,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63," but I think, instead, I will vote"
870,00:35:32.43,00:35:32.43," for Jeanne, because Jeanne is the one"
871,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,"that stirred up all of this,she's the one that"
872,00:35:36.10,00:35:36.10, first brought it up and then went
873,00:35:37.37,00:35:37.37," around to people and said, you know, ""I think Janet"
874,00:35:39.47,00:35:39.47,"smuggled in food."""
875,00:35:40.47,00:35:40.47,"I mean, she really basicallystirred it all up."
876,00:35:49.63,00:35:49.63,(thunder rolling)
877,00:36:07.77,00:36:07.77,PROBST:Behind each of you guys
878,00:36:09.77,00:36:09.77,is a torchin your tribe color.
879,00:36:11.27,00:36:11.27,"Grab a torch,"
880,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60,"approach a flame,dip it and get fire."
881,00:36:16.77,00:36:16.77,"This is part ofthe ritual of Tribal Council,"
882,00:36:19.77,00:36:19.77,"because at Tribal Council,fire represents life."
883,00:36:22.77,00:36:22.77,"As long as you have fire,you're in the game."
884,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,"When your fire's out,so are you."
885,00:36:26.77,00:36:26.77,And then put the torchesback in their slots
886,00:36:28.63,00:36:28.63,and have a seat.
887,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"So, let's talkabout the first six days."
888,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,"Who's emerging right now, Janet?"
889,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,Is there somebody you look tofor certain things?
890,00:36:43.33,00:36:43.33,Or maybe somebody elsefor other skills?
891,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,"Well, Joanna's anextremely strong woman,"
892,00:36:48.83,00:36:48.83,"incredible strength, and wereally, really relied on her,"
893,00:36:52.57,00:36:52.57,"and Deena both,I, you know, I think"
894,00:36:54.33,00:36:54.33,really... didan incredible amount of chopping
895,00:36:57.80,00:36:57.80,"and, you know,just the really heavy labor,"
896,00:37:00.30,00:37:00.30,because they're justreally strong women.
897,00:37:02.40,00:37:02.40,"Deena, you guyshave certain things"
898,00:37:04.70,00:37:04.70,you have to accomplishat a camp.
899,00:37:06.43,00:37:06.43,"You got to build shelter,"
900,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60,"you got to get fire,you got to find water."
901,00:37:09.43,00:37:09.43,Take me through the shelter.
902,00:37:11.60,00:37:11.60,We have none.
903,00:37:13.13,00:37:13.13,It's... sort of completed.
904,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,"But it's not really a shelter,"
905,00:37:17.00,00:37:17.00,it's kind of a mishmoshof hodgepodge of... of a mess.
906,00:37:20.80,00:37:20.80,You have to factor inthe elements.
907,00:37:22.57,00:37:22.57,"We have a lot of downpours here,"
908,00:37:24.47,00:37:24.47,and then there is the traipsingout to find the right materials.
909,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,"JOANNA: We can't say, oh,we're just gonna take all day"
910,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,and build a shelterand we don't have any water.
911,00:37:32.50,00:37:32.50,We can't say we're gonna takeall day and build a shelter and
912,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,"we don't have a fireto boil the water,"
913,00:37:36.47,00:37:36.47,"'cause if we can't have a fire,we can't boil water to drink."
914,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,And then we're gonna die.
915,00:37:40.03,00:37:40.03,"PROBST:What I'm getting at is,"
916,00:37:41.53,00:37:41.53,it doesn't soundlike you have any plan.
917,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"Christy, is there anything"
918,00:37:46.53,00:37:46.53,that's not being done at campthat you could do better?
919,00:37:49.47,00:37:49.47,The shelter.The shelter.
920,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,I think the shelter shouldhave been built days ago.
921,00:37:55.57,00:37:55.57,"-Joanna, you're shaking yourhead no, no, no. -No, because"
922,00:37:58.57,00:37:58.57,"after we came backwith the palm fronds,"
923,00:38:00.13,00:38:00.13,"somebody asked her aboutcompleting the shelter, and she"
924,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,"-was, like, ""No, I wanna gofishing."" -Well, that was today,"
925,00:38:04.53,00:38:04.53,"because I work hard,there are people"
926,00:38:06.03,00:38:06.03,"sitting down, doing nothing,"
927,00:38:07.63,00:38:07.63,"and here I am, tryingto put a shelter together"
928,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,"and I get no help, no support."
929,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,"I asked questions,I got no answer."
930,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,"So I felt very, like,so you want me to help you now?"
931,00:38:17.03,00:38:17.03,PROBST:Do you feel excluded?
932,00:38:19.17,00:38:19.17,-Yes.-Do you think
933,00:38:21.03,00:38:21.03,it has to do with
934,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,-that you're deaf?-Yes.
935,00:38:24.03,00:38:24.03,No question?
936,00:38:25.03,00:38:25.03,(choked up):No question.
937,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57,PROBST:What's a sign of that?
938,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,When...
939,00:38:30.57,00:38:30.57,"there's somethingimportant going on,"
940,00:38:32.63,00:38:32.63,I'm not... I haveno idea what's going on.
941,00:38:35.03,00:38:35.03,I don't know whenI need to join the group.
942,00:38:37.70,00:38:37.70,"I... um, every time I'm there,people just..."
943,00:38:39.73,00:38:39.73,"move away, or they just...they don't include me."
944,00:38:44.57,00:38:44.57,"I work harder than them,"
945,00:38:47.23,00:38:47.23,and I don't feellike they're working...
946,00:38:49.73,00:38:49.73,And it just makes it harder whenyour team doesn't accept you.
947,00:38:53.70,00:38:53.70,"PROBST:Janet, body language is"
948,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,-telling me everything.-I-I just find it
949,00:38:57.13,00:38:57.13,insulting for someoneto say that we sit around.
950,00:39:00.33,00:39:00.33,"Let me ask you, then--what do you think about"
951,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,the notion that Christyis being excluded on purpose?
952,00:39:07.93,00:39:07.93,I think that's also ridiculous.
953,00:39:09.23,00:39:09.23,It's not...we don't exclude anybody.
954,00:39:12.30,00:39:12.30,"We're women living togetherin the jungle,"
955,00:39:14.70,00:39:14.70,trying to survivewithout food and water.
956,00:39:17.17,00:39:17.17,"So eventually,reactions are gonna happen."
957,00:39:22.53,00:39:22.53,It is time to vote.
958,00:39:24.00,00:39:24.00,"Heidi, you're up."
959,00:39:36.37,00:39:36.37,"Janet, I'm voting for you,"
960,00:39:38.40,00:39:38.40,because I knowyou want out of here.
961,00:39:40.77,00:39:40.77," You were sick at first, and it's really hard to catch up."
962,00:39:55.23,00:39:55.23,"I understandwe need physical strength,"
963,00:39:58.13,00:39:58.13,but your attitude stinks.
964,00:40:24.03,00:40:24.03,My vote is for Jeanne.
965,00:40:26.03,00:40:26.03,"You've got incredible strength,"
966,00:40:28.80,00:40:28.80," you're just nonstop,but you're just too aggressive."
967,00:40:54.80,00:40:54.80,I'll go tally the votes.
968,00:41:03.93,00:41:03.93,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
969,00:41:06.23,00:41:06.23,The person votedout'll be asked to leave
970,00:41:08.30,00:41:08.30,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
971,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,I'll read the votes.
972,00:41:14.53,00:41:14.53,First vote...
973,00:41:17.33,00:41:17.33,Jenna.
974,00:41:22.83,00:41:22.83,Janet.
975,00:41:29.17,00:41:29.17,Christy.
976,00:41:33.47,00:41:33.47,Jeanne.
977,00:41:35.10,00:41:35.10,"That's one vote Jeanne,one vote Janet,"
978,00:41:37.50,00:41:37.50,"one vote Christy,one vote Jenna."
979,00:41:44.43,00:41:44.43,Janet.
980,00:41:45.93,00:41:45.93,Two votes Janet.
981,00:41:50.20,00:41:50.20,Three votes Janet.
982,00:41:56.77,00:41:56.77,First personvoted out of Jaburu...
983,00:42:00.10,00:42:00.10,"Janet. That's four,and that's enough."
984,00:42:01.90,00:42:01.90,The last votewill remain a mystery.
985,00:42:03.83,00:42:03.83,You need to bring me your torch.
986,00:42:14.90,00:42:14.90,"Janet, the tribe has spoken."
987,00:42:20.43,00:42:20.43,It's time for you to go.
988,00:42:22.67,00:42:22.67,"Good luck, guys."
989,00:42:31.07,00:42:31.07,I hope tomorrow morning brings
990,00:42:34.67,00:42:34.67,some much needed changeto this tribe.
991,00:42:37.67,00:42:37.67,Good night.Head back to camp.
992,00:42:51.60,00:42:51.60,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
993,00:42:57.97,00:42:57.97," PROBST: Next time on Survivor,  Jaburu can't get it together."
994,00:43:01.87,00:43:01.87,"JEANNE: The hygiene of the camp right now is lacking,"
995,00:43:04.77,00:43:04.77, and our tribe is pretty much
996,00:43:05.97,00:43:05.97,pathetic.
997,00:43:07.10,00:43:07.10,PROBST: But can they get cleaned up in time
998,00:43:09.20,00:43:09.20, for their big date with Tambaqui?
999,00:43:11.30,00:43:11.30,"-It's sort of a mixer, if youwill. -But you should hear"
