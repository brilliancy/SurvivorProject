2,00:00:01.23,00:00:01.23,"JEFF PROBST:  Previously, on Survivor:"
3,00:00:02.50,00:00:02.50, Rob created a chain of command
4,00:00:04.40,00:00:04.40, to keep Matt and Butch busy.
5,00:00:05.93,00:00:05.93,"Butch is on, seriously, on a need-to-know basis."
6,00:00:09.53,00:00:09.53,"MATT: We gotta be a chain,"
7,00:00:10.73,00:00:10.73,"from, like, a chain-link."
8,00:00:12.50,00:00:12.50," Matt was afraid  of being viewed as a threat,"
9,00:00:15.13,00:00:15.13, but it didn't matter  when Alex hit the mark
10,00:00:17.50,00:00:17.50,-and won the reward challenge.  -Alex is drinking coffee!
11,00:00:20.60,00:00:20.60, And he invited Jenna  to enjoy coffee and pastries.
12,00:00:24.20,00:00:24.20,-This... is so nice. -Mm. Mm.
13,00:00:26.37,00:00:26.37,"To you, for winning."
14,00:00:27.93,00:00:27.93," Back at camp, Deena was concerned about Alex's victory."
15,00:00:31.27,00:00:31.27,DEENA: We don't have a chance if Alex is in this game.
16,00:00:34.53,00:00:34.53,"PROBST: With Alex and Jenna  back from the reward,"
17,00:00:36.97,00:00:36.97, Heidi revealed Deena's plan.
18,00:00:39.70,00:00:39.70,HEIDI: Alex and Jenna  were my original alliance.
19,00:00:41.50,00:00:41.50,I'm not gonna turn my back on them.
20,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,"PROBST: That night,  Heidi was bit by a spider."
21,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,It's getting bad.
22,00:00:46.67,00:00:46.67, So she had to be carried
23,00:00:48.30,00:00:48.30," to the immunity challenge  by Alex,"
24,00:00:50.23,00:00:50.23, where the tribe  got a taste of the Amazon.
25,00:00:52.40,00:00:52.40,(crunching)
26,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,PROBST: Keep it down.
27,00:00:55.37,00:00:55.37, When a live  beetle larva was more
28,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33, -than Deena could stomach...  -That is just nasty-ass!
29,00:01:00.10,00:01:00.10,-Go! -...she felt secure enough  to give up immunity...
30,00:01:03.20,00:01:03.20,You are safe from the vote tonight.
31,00:01:04.80,00:01:04.80,-Cool. -Nice effort.
32,00:01:05.93,00:01:05.93, ...but was shocked
33,00:01:07.27,00:01:07.27," at Tribal Council  when her alliance of Alex,"
34,00:01:09.53,00:01:09.53," Heidi, Jenna and Rob  turned the tables on her."
35,00:01:12.80,00:01:12.80,Ninth person voted out
36,00:01:14.00,00:01:14.00,and the second member of our jury: Deena.
37,00:01:16.47,00:01:16.47,The tribe has spoken.
38,00:01:20.23,00:01:20.23, Seven remain.
39,00:01:21.37,00:01:21.37, Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:50.27,00:02:50.27,ALEX: The buff-- the multipurp--
41,00:02:52.20,00:02:52.20,-the multipurpose accessory. -No kidding.
42,00:02:53.83,00:02:53.83,I still haven't worn it as a tube top.
43,00:02:56.87,00:02:56.87,"JENNA: You wear it as a tube top, I'll wear it as a skirt."
44,00:03:00.20,00:03:00.20,"-I know, that'd be fun. -Then we'll be"
45,00:03:01.80,00:03:01.80,-like the Bobbsey Twins. -(laughs)
46,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,ALEX: Jenna and Heidi and Rob  and I are having a blast.
47,00:03:07.00,00:03:07.00,"Game-wise, it's working out great for us,"
48,00:03:08.77,00:03:08.77,"'cause we have a majority,"
49,00:03:10.20,00:03:10.20," and as long as   we control immunity,"
50,00:03:12.27,00:03:12.27, it's the four of us  that are the final four.
51,00:03:14.37,00:03:14.37,ROB:  Catch any fish today?
52,00:03:16.70,00:03:16.70,JENNA:  No.
53,00:03:17.93,00:03:17.93,ROB:  One of them's gonna get fired
54,00:03:19.37,00:03:19.37, -if they don't soon.  -In three days?
55,00:03:21.07,00:03:21.07,Yeah. They're falling behind on what
56,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,they need to be doing around here.
57,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,"There's no firewood,"
58,00:03:26.13,00:03:26.13,-there's no fish. -(laughing)
59,00:03:28.43,00:03:28.43,-JENNA: They need to get their acts together. -Yeah.
60,00:03:30.57,00:03:30.57,"I'm booked all day, thinking of funny things to say."
61,00:03:33.63,00:03:33.63,JENNA: And I'm booked all day trying
62,00:03:35.03,00:03:35.03,to figure out a really cool outfit to wear to the challenge.
63,00:03:37.00,00:03:37.00,ALEX:  I'm enjoying this game a lot.
64,00:03:39.27,00:03:39.27," I mean, I knew that  I would meet cool people;"
65,00:03:40.73,00:03:40.73, I never thought that  I would meet people that
66,00:03:42.43,00:03:42.43,I consider friends that I want to continue to be friends with.
67,00:03:46.87,00:03:46.87,"JENNA: Like, I consider you three, like,"
68,00:03:49.57,00:03:49.57,"-my best friends, like, -HEIDI: That's it."
69,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,"in and out of the game, though."
70,00:03:52.47,00:03:52.47,"And not just here; like, at home."
71,00:03:54.37,00:03:54.37,I'm an only child; I'm so close with my mom and dad.
72,00:03:56.97,00:03:56.97," Like, I just sit at home  and chill with them,"
73,00:03:58.97,00:03:58.97," like, almost  every night of the week"
74,00:04:00.43,00:04:00.43, and just eat and have fun.
75,00:04:02.03,00:04:02.03, I miss them.
76,00:04:03.53,00:04:03.53,"Plus, my mom's not well."
77,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,"I left her, and she's..."
78,00:04:06.77,00:04:06.77,"you know, hopefully doing really well while I'm gone."
79,00:04:10.83,00:04:10.83,HEIDI:  Jenna's mom is sick.
80,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83," She has cancer. I mean,"
81,00:04:14.60,00:04:14.60,we haven't heard from our families
82,00:04:16.10,00:04:16.10,in gosh knows how long. (laughs)
83,00:04:17.87,00:04:17.87,"So, I mean, it's scary."
84,00:04:19.60,00:04:19.60, And Jenna's just worried sick.
85,00:04:22.10,00:04:22.10,"JENNA:  I think about them often,"
86,00:04:24.27,00:04:24.27,but it's nice to have a core group of people
87,00:04:26.70,00:04:26.70,"that I love here, also,"
88,00:04:28.23,00:04:28.23,that's also made me not have to think about them as often.
89,00:04:31.40,00:04:31.40,That really helps; it really does.
90,00:04:46.63,00:04:46.63,ALEX:  It's a little bit like...
91,00:04:49.33,00:04:49.33,"and I hate to say it, but it's a little bit like high school."
92,00:04:52.23,00:04:52.23,"Jenna and Heidi, Rob and I have"
93,00:04:53.90,00:04:53.90, the luxury of doing  a little less work
94,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97," because we hold a majority,  and the other three know it."
95,00:05:00.83,00:05:00.83,"CHRISTY:  I am a hard worker,"
96,00:05:03.33,00:05:03.33,and I know I'm a hard worker and I don't mind working hard.
97,00:05:06.47,00:05:06.47,(wood clatters loudly)
98,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67," But sometimes it's, like,  come on, get off your butt"
99,00:05:09.63,00:05:09.63, and go and get some wood  or go and try to do something.
100,00:05:13.10,00:05:13.10,And they just do jack ...
101,00:05:19.77,00:05:19.77,Hey!
102,00:05:22.03,00:05:22.03,What am I missing?
103,00:05:23.70,00:05:23.70,MATTHEW:  I find their behavior to be...
104,00:05:26.10,00:05:26.10, incomprehensible.
105,00:05:31.97,00:05:31.97, Maybe the final four  will be made up
106,00:05:33.60,00:05:33.60," of Rob, Alex,  Jenna and Heidi, but..."
107,00:05:36.60,00:05:36.60, by betraying the other  three members of the tribe
108,00:05:39.87,00:05:39.87,"and treating them like dirt,"
109,00:05:41.70,00:05:41.70,they've basically guaranteed
110,00:05:43.50,00:05:43.50," that myself, Butch and Christy  will vote against them"
111,00:05:46.30,00:05:46.30, if any one of them  makes it to the final two.
112,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,BUTCH: That's just...
113,00:05:50.87,00:05:50.87,ridiculous.
114,00:06:04.30,00:06:04.30,"ROB: Wait, hold on."
115,00:06:05.47,00:06:05.47,(laughs) We have money!
116,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30,-It is! -(happy screaming)
117,00:06:10.23,00:06:10.23,"Oh, my God!"
118,00:06:11.37,00:06:11.37,(screaming)
119,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,"Oh, my God! I have money!"
120,00:06:14.67,00:06:14.67,Awesome.
121,00:06:17.83,00:06:17.83,I'm so excited!
122,00:06:20.53,00:06:20.53,"Now, read-- read it."
123,00:06:21.67,00:06:21.67,"Oh, my God, I am so excited,"
124,00:06:22.93,00:06:22.93,I can't even control myself.
125,00:06:24.43,00:06:24.43,"ROB: ""Easy come, easy go,"
126,00:06:25.83,00:06:25.83,"""you're invited to come and play, you will compete"
127,00:06:27.80,00:06:27.80,"to get some treats, but soon the offer goes away."""
128,00:06:29.47,00:06:29.47,Does that mean we all
129,00:06:30.73,00:06:30.73,"get something, or is this a joke?"
130,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20, The treemail said  something like
131,00:06:33.57,00:06:33.57,"they're gonna auction off, you know,"
132,00:06:35.27,00:06:35.27,make sure you place your bets wisely for food.
133,00:06:38.23,00:06:38.23,-$500. -Wow!
134,00:06:40.77,00:06:40.77,"ROB: I'm tempted to say screw the food; this is,"
135,00:06:43.63,00:06:43.63,"-like, my life savings. -(laughter)"
136,00:06:45.37,00:06:45.37,"JENNA: I said, do we get to keep the extra?"
137,00:06:46.90,00:06:46.90,HEIDI: Ditto.
138,00:06:52.27,00:06:52.27,PROBST: Come on in.
139,00:06:54.27,00:06:54.27,Have a seat.
140,00:06:58.57,00:06:58.57,Welcome to the Survivor auction.

146,00:07:13.33,00:07:13.33,The auction will stop without warning.
147,00:07:14.93,00:07:14.93,If you see something
148,00:07:16.27,00:07:16.27,"you like, I suggest you bid on it and not assume"
149,00:07:19.00,00:07:19.00,something better is coming down the pike.
150,00:07:21.47,00:07:21.47,"-Shall we get started? -Absolutely! -Yes, please."
151,00:07:26.13,00:07:26.13,Ready for the first item?

161,00:07:44.37,00:07:44.37,"She would've, she would've bid $500 on it."
162,00:07:46.17,00:07:46.17,"-Good, girlfriend? -MATTHEW: Oh, yeah."

184,00:08:29.57,00:08:29.57,Mm-mm-mm.
185,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,-Why not? -You gonna trade?
186,00:08:33.20,00:08:33.20,"Uh, yeah, no, I'm gonna go with what I bought."
187,00:08:35.30,00:08:35.30,You're gonna stay with what you bought.
188,00:08:36.80,00:08:36.80,"You know, Jeff, you're just so tough on me here, man."
189,00:08:38.97,00:08:38.97,"PROBST: Go with your gut, Alex. What's your gut saying?"
190,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83,I'll stick with what I bought.

195,00:08:49.43,00:08:49.43,"Well, here's what you turned down."
196,00:08:50.47,00:08:50.47,"All right, what did I turn down?"
197,00:08:51.67,00:08:51.67,-Might as well take a look at that. -Sure.
198,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,-(Jenna gasps) -PROBST: Lasagna.
199,00:08:55.30,00:08:55.30,"Oh, yeah, baby! Some Italian food!"
200,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13,"-That's rough. -PROBST: So, odds are what?"
201,00:08:59.40,00:08:59.40,"I got screwed. But, hey, you never know."

403,00:17:05.53,00:17:05.53, such a great feeling.
404,00:17:07.03,00:17:07.03," Maybe I can't trust  anybody out here,"
405,00:17:09.10,00:17:09.10,but I definitely can trust people at home.
406,00:17:36.27,00:17:36.27,-JENNA (sobbing): It shrunk. -HEIDI: It's okay.
407,00:17:38.73,00:17:38.73,It shrunk.
408,00:17:40.10,00:17:40.10,-Her tumor shrunk 50%. -Nice.
409,00:17:42.47,00:17:42.47,It's almost gone.
410,00:17:44.17,00:17:44.17,(sobbing)
411,00:17:46.00,00:17:46.00,HEIDI: She started crying  because her mom had written
412,00:17:48.93,00:17:48.93, that the brain tumor  had decreased by 50%.
413,00:17:53.43,00:17:53.43," I mean, it was just, like,"
414,00:17:55.00,00:17:55.00,one of the greatest things.
415,00:17:56.30,00:17:56.30,I started crying because I was so happy for her.
416,00:17:58.57,00:17:58.57,"-ALEX: That's fantastic. -JENNA: Yeah, it is."
417,00:18:00.63,00:18:00.63,"ROB: Yeah, that's so great."
418,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,JENNA:  Hearing from my family--
419,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00, my mom and dad-- it's just...
420,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,better than anything I could've ever asked for.
421,00:18:09.50,00:18:09.50,It just helps you move on.
422,00:18:11.63,00:18:11.63,I just need to hear
423,00:18:12.97,00:18:12.97," about how they were  and what they're doing,"
424,00:18:15.27,00:18:15.27, and it's hard.
425,00:18:17.70,00:18:17.70,But I'm glad. It really was the best thing.
426,00:18:19.63,00:18:19.63,"ROB:  Yeah, that's so great."
427,00:18:20.97,00:18:20.97,-That's enough for me. -HEIDI: That is so great.
428,00:18:22.83,00:18:22.83,"-Thanks, guys. -That is so great."
429,00:18:24.47,00:18:24.47,-Thank you. -That is great.
430,00:18:50.17,00:18:50.17,There's a lot of meat on this one.
431,00:18:52.20,00:18:52.20,"MATTHEW: Yep, that's... that's a breakfast, dude."
432,00:18:54.07,00:18:54.07,That is a beautiful fish.
433,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,We haven't eaten that fish yet.
434,00:19:02.10,00:19:02.10,(whispering): I think that we've got a great shot
435,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,if we work on Rob today
436,00:19:07.80,00:19:07.80,and get him to come over to our side.
437,00:19:11.77,00:19:11.77,MATTHEW:  Right now is a critical time.
438,00:19:14.37,00:19:14.37,There are a number of subgroups  that have formed.
439,00:19:18.07,00:19:18.07,"One potential subgroup consists  of Alex, Heidi and Jenna,"
440,00:19:23.07,00:19:23.07, and then there's Rob.
441,00:19:25.43,00:19:25.43,"(whispering): I think that if we can get Rob to join us,"
442,00:19:27.97,00:19:27.97,that'll give us four powerful votes in Tribal Council.
443,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,It's got to be obvious to Rob that he's expendable if he...
444,00:19:35.13,00:19:35.13,if he aligns himself with Alex.
445,00:19:36.67,00:19:36.67,BUTCH: We don't want to get  in too big of a hurry.
446,00:19:39.83,00:19:39.83,We don't want to rush this.
447,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,"We don't want to try and get it all done right now,"
448,00:19:43.33,00:19:43.33,"because, then, sometimes it leaks out."
449,00:19:44.83,00:19:44.83,We can approach Christy later on.
450,00:19:46.23,00:19:46.23,I can do that very delicately.
451,00:19:47.97,00:19:47.97,"Because, right now, I mean, she said"
452,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,"she doesn't trust anyone,"
453,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80,but I've had a lot of very good conversations
454,00:19:53.20,00:19:53.20,"-with her, and I like her. -All right."
455,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,"All right, let's get back, 'cause I don't want them"
456,00:19:56.67,00:19:56.67,to come down and see us talking this close.
457,00:19:58.93,00:19:58.93,"MATTHEW: I think that we've  got a great shot,"
458,00:20:02.03,00:20:02.03," assuming, uh...  once they join us."
459,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,"Otherwise, Butch and I and Christy will go"
460,00:20:08.20,00:20:08.20,over the next three Tribal Councils.
461,00:20:21.93,00:20:21.93,(fire crackling)
462,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,-How'd you sleep? -Slept well.
463,00:20:48.00,00:20:48.00,"So, Rob, I was thinking,"
464,00:20:50.03,00:20:50.03,"if the four of us go to the final four,"
465,00:20:53.10,00:20:53.10,I know that those two have sworn to each other
466,00:20:54.80,00:20:54.80,-they're never going to vote for each other. -Mm-hmm.
467,00:20:56.93,00:20:56.93,"-So, the way I see it, -Mm-hmm."
468,00:20:59.53,00:20:59.53,"if I win immunity, my vote goes for you,"
469,00:21:02.93,00:21:02.93,"and I'm sure that if you win immunity,"
470,00:21:04.90,00:21:04.90,"you're going to vote me off, and that's totally cool."
471,00:21:07.30,00:21:07.30,-I'm down. It's no worries. -Okay.
472,00:21:10.43,00:21:10.43,Alex's decision to tell me
473,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,that he was going to vote me out
474,00:21:14.60,00:21:14.60,at the final four is really
475,00:21:17.90,00:21:17.90, kind of curious.
476,00:21:19.23,00:21:19.23, I think it has to do  with this idea
477,00:21:22.30,00:21:22.30," that we're all  each other's best friends,"
478,00:21:24.27,00:21:24.27," and even though I'm going  to be voted out fourth,"
479,00:21:26.43,00:21:26.43,I'm losing to three worthy players.
480,00:21:30.77,00:21:30.77,"ALEX: And if one of them wins immunity,"
481,00:21:32.30,00:21:32.30,"then that's a whole nother ball of wax,"
482,00:21:34.00,00:21:34.00,and I don't know... I-I don't know what... what happens then.
483,00:21:36.07,00:21:36.07,"But I'm just saying between you and I,"
484,00:21:38.33,00:21:38.33,'cause we've been down with each other
485,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,"from the very beginning, and I'll be honest with you"
486,00:21:41.67,00:21:41.67,"and just straight-up, and say..."
487,00:21:43.63,00:21:43.63,"you know, I mean, 'cause these two are never"
488,00:21:45.77,00:21:45.77,going to vote against each other.
489,00:21:46.90,00:21:46.90,"-They told me as much, you know? -Right."
490,00:21:48.63,00:21:48.63,"They've sworn their lives to each other, so..."
491,00:21:50.63,00:21:50.63,"that's, you know...?"
492,00:21:52.40,00:21:52.40,So whatever happens at four happens.
493,00:21:54.37,00:21:54.37,-You know what I mean? -Uh-huh.
494,00:21:56.13,00:21:56.13,Are you cool with that?
495,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,ROB: I realize  that I've been coming off
496,00:22:00.53,00:22:00.53," as very sensitive  with this group,"
497,00:22:02.40,00:22:02.40,talking about how much I love them and how much
498,00:22:04.47,00:22:04.47,"I'm going to be friends with them aft-after the game,"
499,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,"but I have never stopped playing Survivor,"
500,00:22:09.90,00:22:09.90, and over my dead body  will I turn over
501,00:22:12.57,00:22:12.57, and let somebody  just pass me by.
502,00:22:14.60,00:22:14.60,"All right, well, we'll cross that bridge"
503,00:22:16.20,00:22:16.20,-when we come to it. -Yeah.
504,00:22:25.77,00:22:25.77,(snorting)
505,00:22:28.03,00:22:28.03,(hissing)
506,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"Bad news, guys. It's the S.A.T.s."
507,00:22:43.10,00:22:43.10,-(laughter) -Okay.
508,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,"ALEX: We received a very interesting,"
509,00:22:46.13,00:22:46.13," uh, little treemail  this morning."
510,00:22:48.13,00:22:48.13," There was big test booklets  with each of our name on it,"
511,00:22:51.30,00:22:51.30," and it said to answer  all the questions,"
512,00:22:53.40,00:22:53.40,to not discuss it with anyone.
513,00:22:55.33,00:22:55.33,"""This is a confidential document"
514,00:22:57.53,00:22:57.53,"""which your fellow tribe members will never see,"
515,00:22:59.73,00:22:59.73,"so please answer honestly."""
516,00:23:01.27,00:23:01.27," It's... obviously,  it means some kind of a game"
517,00:23:03.20,00:23:03.20, to see if your answers match
518,00:23:04.70,00:23:04.70,"everyone else's-- we think, anyway."
519,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83," So it should be interesting,"
520,00:23:08.07,00:23:08.07," when we get  to the immunity challenge,"
521,00:23:09.23,00:23:09.23, to see how our answers  are used.
522,00:23:13.10,00:23:13.10,"CHRISTY: Some questions  were easy to answer, like,"
523,00:23:16.53,00:23:16.53,"""Who is the biggest drama king or queen?"" You know?"
524,00:23:19.60,00:23:19.60," Then it got to some, like,  ""Who needs therapy?"""
525,00:23:23.00,00:23:23.00," Or, ""Who is the tribe slob?"""
526,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"It made me more aware and, like,"
527,00:23:26.83,00:23:26.83,"really, like, think about who's who."
528,00:23:31.93,00:23:31.93,ROB: The treemail was sort of  a slam book-type quiz.
529,00:23:37.50,00:23:37.50," Things like, uh,"
530,00:23:38.83,00:23:38.83,"""Who would you trust with your life?"""
531,00:23:41.03,00:23:41.03,And a bunch of very interesting questions
532,00:23:43.43,00:23:43.43,that really got me thinking about a number of things.
533,00:23:50.67,00:23:50.67,"Matt, this is the most important conversation..."
534,00:23:52.10,00:23:52.10,Yep.
535,00:23:53.10,00:23:53.10,...that I'm going to have with you
536,00:23:54.73,00:23:54.73,-in this entire game. -In this game.
537,00:23:56.17,00:23:56.17,MATTHEW:  Rob and I had perhaps the most
538,00:23:58.17,00:23:58.17,important conversation of the game.
539,00:24:01.23,00:24:01.23," He sat me down,  and he said, ""Matthew,"
540,00:24:03.60,00:24:03.60," ""I'm going to lay out  what has happened"
541,00:24:05.53,00:24:05.53,"over the past couple of weeks."""
542,00:24:07.93,00:24:07.93,"-First, I need to come clean with you. -Okay."
543,00:24:10.43,00:24:10.43,"Once we got to Jacar\xc3\xa9,"
544,00:24:12.87,00:24:12.87,I had been telling you
545,00:24:14.53,00:24:14.53,that the men were going to stick together
546,00:24:16.43,00:24:16.43,"after we got rid of Roger and Dave,"
547,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,-but that wasn't true. -Right.
548,00:24:20.07,00:24:20.07,"I'm telling you this because I know that you trust me,"
549,00:24:23.23,00:24:23.23,-Sure. -...and I don't want to tell you any more lies.
550,00:24:25.67,00:24:25.67,-Sure. Okay. -I swear that this is the honest truth.
551,00:24:28.80,00:24:28.80,"MATTHEW: He said that there  had been a lot of, uh,"
552,00:24:31.17,00:24:31.17," times when I had been  in danger,"
553,00:24:32.80,00:24:32.80, and people that I thought  were on my side
554,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83," were actually plotting  against me,"
555,00:24:36.63,00:24:36.63,"and on several occasions,"
556,00:24:37.80,00:24:37.80,he was included and was stringing me along.
557,00:24:40.27,00:24:40.27,"Dude, you are... are the only person"
558,00:24:41.70,00:24:41.70,I really trust in this game--
559,00:24:43.10,00:24:43.10,"-and Butch now, because he has no options. -Well... yes."
560,00:24:45.50,00:24:45.50,That's going to change.
561,00:24:47.27,00:24:47.27,"MATTHEW:  Rob can be very underhanded,"
562,00:24:50.07,00:24:50.07," but I appreciated his honesty,  and I appreciated"
563,00:24:54.63,00:24:54.63,what he had to say next.
564,00:24:55.90,00:24:55.90,Alex is the power player here.
565,00:24:57.70,00:24:57.70,He thinks that you're the only person
566,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,"that can beat him in a physical competition,"
567,00:25:00.87,00:25:00.87,and that's why he... he wants you to go.
568,00:25:02.73,00:25:02.73,"And Alex told me yesterday that when we get to four,"
569,00:25:06.13,00:25:06.13,he's going to vote against me.
570,00:25:07.73,00:25:07.73,He said that to you?
571,00:25:09.13,00:25:09.13,Yes. This is what happens
572,00:25:10.47,00:25:10.47,-when people start being arrogant. -Right.
573,00:25:12.90,00:25:12.90,It's hubris.
574,00:25:14.03,00:25:14.03,MATTHEW:  I was appalled
575,00:25:16.13,00:25:16.13,"at their audacity,"
576,00:25:17.53,00:25:17.53,that they would go so far as to say that...
577,00:25:21.00,00:25:21.00,"that Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Rob had wrapped it all up"
578,00:25:24.57,00:25:24.57,and that it was merely a question
579,00:25:26.30,00:25:26.30,of which one of the four would win a million dollars.
580,00:25:29.40,00:25:29.40,"Me, you, Butch and Christy vote out Alex tomorrow."
581,00:25:31.63,00:25:31.63,That's what I was thinking.
582,00:25:33.30,00:25:33.30,"If Alex wins immunity, I don't know what we're going to do."
583,00:25:35.20,00:25:35.20,"Well, dude, I'll give you my word..."
584,00:25:36.67,00:25:36.67,I'll give you my word on my...
585,00:25:38.20,00:25:38.20,"I'll give my only word I'm ever going to give in this game,"
586,00:25:40.23,00:25:40.23,-Mm-hmm. -...and I... I appreciate what you've said.
587,00:25:41.80,00:25:41.80,I will not betray you. And you know what?
588,00:25:43.53,00:25:43.53,"If it falls through, then I'm out,"
589,00:25:45.73,00:25:45.73,"-but you're it, so... -Right. Well, we're both..."
590,00:25:47.57,00:25:47.57,-we're both out if this falls through. -Okay.
591,00:25:49.00,00:25:49.00,"MATTHEW: I do have a lot  of survival skills,"
592,00:25:51.57,00:25:51.57, but I am very ignorant  when it comes to...
593,00:25:54.80,00:25:54.80, the game and how it's played.
594,00:25:56.90,00:25:56.90," Rob has zero survival skills,"
595,00:25:59.53,00:25:59.53,but knows the game inside and out.
596,00:26:01.40,00:26:01.40,"I can get... get Christy, no problem."
597,00:26:03.30,00:26:03.30,"-She hates the two girls. -Alex? Okay, great."
598,00:26:05.60,00:26:05.60,"-And I think she hates Alex, too. -Okay."
599,00:26:07.53,00:26:07.53,ROB:  I am very aware
600,00:26:08.93,00:26:08.93,"of the arrogance of my alliance,"
601,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,and I think that is going to help me here.
602,00:26:14.30,00:26:14.30, And I don't think it's  going to be very difficult
603,00:26:16.97,00:26:16.97, to sway the opinions  of the three people
604,00:26:18.43,00:26:18.43, that aren't in this alliance.
605,00:26:22.80,00:26:22.80,What?
606,00:26:24.20,00:26:24.20,-What are you smiling about? -Nothing.
607,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,(chuckling)
608,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,"ROB:  Christy is a sweet girl,"
609,00:26:31.23,00:26:31.23, but she does not fit in  with this group.
610,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83, I have a feeling  that a lot of girls
611,00:26:35.40,00:26:35.40, that were like Jenna and Heidi
612,00:26:37.10,00:26:37.10,were very mean to Christy in her... in her life.
613,00:26:40.77,00:26:40.77,CHRISTY: So what are you thinking?
614,00:26:42.20,00:26:42.20,All I assume was the four of you guys
615,00:26:43.83,00:26:43.83,"made a pact, and just, like, you guys"
616,00:26:45.33,00:26:45.33,"are going all the way, so I'm going to be gone"
617,00:26:46.70,00:26:46.70,"-in the next nine days. -Well, I just... I just..."
618,00:26:48.07,00:26:48.07,I don't trust Alex anymore.
619,00:26:49.13,00:26:49.13,"He's lied and changed his story,"
620,00:26:51.33,00:26:51.33,"a number of times, on what he's going to do."
621,00:26:54.30,00:26:54.30,So are you thinking of trying to get
622,00:26:56.07,00:26:56.07,"Butch, Matt, you and me to vote them out?"
623,00:26:58.40,00:26:58.40,-To vote off Alex. -Oh.
624,00:26:59.90,00:26:59.90,I-I-I'm up for voting Alex out.
625,00:27:02.03,00:27:02.03,-I knew you would be. -'Cause I don't think
626,00:27:04.10,00:27:04.10,"he plays fair, personally."
627,00:27:06.03,00:27:06.03,"I'm, like, ""Dude, I'm with you."
628,00:27:07.50,00:27:07.50,"I'm with you to get Alex out,"" just because Alex..."
629,00:27:10.50,00:27:10.50,"Aah! I could care less about him, and I just..."
630,00:27:13.63,00:27:13.63,"Ugh! And he's... he's just, like..."
631,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03," drooling over Jenna and Heidi,  and it's just, like, come on!"
632,00:27:20.73,00:27:20.73," Then again, I don't know.  Can you really trust Rob?"
633,00:27:23.63,00:27:23.63,"Is he really going to say that to make us feel like,"
634,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,"well, we actually have a chance,"
635,00:27:27.50,00:27:27.50,or is he just trying to stir up something?
636,00:27:36.90,00:27:36.90,"Come on in, guys."
637,00:27:43.13,00:27:43.13,"Okay, at this point, down to seven people."
638,00:27:46.23,00:27:46.23,Your awareness
639,00:27:47.87,00:27:47.87,of what is going on within the tribe is critical.
640,00:27:50.27,00:27:50.27,"The more you know about your tribe mates,"
641,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77,"chances are, the better you're going to do."
642,00:27:54.77,00:27:54.77,That brings us to tonight's immunity challenge.
643,00:27:56.90,00:27:56.90,"This morning, you were given questionnaires."
644,00:27:58.67,00:27:58.67,You answered the questions. I've tallied the results.
645,00:28:00.90,00:28:00.90,"For the immunity challenge, you're going to have to guess"
646,00:28:03.47,00:28:03.47,what the entire tribe said as a whole-- what was the most
647,00:28:06.83,00:28:06.83,common answer given for each question.
648,00:28:09.33,00:28:09.33,First one to five wins.
649,00:28:11.17,00:28:11.17,First things first.
650,00:28:12.33,00:28:12.33,Take back immunity.
651,00:28:22.13,00:28:22.13,Immunity back up for grabs.
652,00:28:24.17,00:28:24.17,First question:
653,00:28:25.80,00:28:25.80,Who would you trust with your life?
654,00:28:32.00,00:28:32.00,Everybody reveal.
655,00:28:36.13,00:28:36.13,Correct answer's Butch.
656,00:28:38.33,00:28:38.33,"How's that feel, Butch?"
657,00:28:39.67,00:28:39.67,That's a pretty big statement.
658,00:28:41.13,00:28:41.13,"Really makes me feel good, and I would..."
659,00:28:42.57,00:28:42.57,"I would, um, do my best to do it."
660,00:28:45.20,00:28:45.20,And you answered yourself.
661,00:28:46.43,00:28:46.43,"Yes, I did."
662,00:28:47.73,00:28:47.73,Here's the score. Butch has one.
663,00:28:49.27,00:28:49.27,Rob has one. Jenna has one.
664,00:28:52.13,00:28:52.13,Next question:
665,00:28:53.73,00:28:53.73,Which tribe member uses sex appeal as a weapon?
666,00:29:00.23,00:29:00.23,Everybody ready?
667,00:29:01.80,00:29:01.80,Reveal.
668,00:29:05.37,00:29:05.37,Interesting. Jenna says Heidi.
669,00:29:08.73,00:29:08.73,-(laughing) -Heidi says Jenna.
670,00:29:12.23,00:29:12.23,Correct answer: Jenna.
671,00:29:14.07,00:29:14.07,Ooh.
672,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,-Surprise you? -A little.
673,00:29:18.00,00:29:18.00,I don't know if I should feel like people think I'm sleazy
674,00:29:21.47,00:29:21.47,"or... that's really cool, but... oh, well."
675,00:29:24.60,00:29:24.60,"PROBST: But it's not new to you, right?"
676,00:29:26.07,00:29:26.07,Being a young woman using sex
677,00:29:27.63,00:29:27.63,"-with men to...? -Well, I-I..."
678,00:29:29.00,00:29:29.00,I don't think it's done purposely
679,00:29:30.63,00:29:30.63,"to try to, you know, snake anybody, but..."
680,00:29:32.93,00:29:32.93,maybe by accident?
681,00:29:34.90,00:29:34.90,(chuckles) Said with a... an adorable smile.
682,00:29:36.60,00:29:36.60,See? That's the thing. Okay.
683,00:29:38.87,00:29:38.87,"Heidi, Matthew, Christy and Alex each get a point."
684,00:29:42.20,00:29:42.20,Everybody now on the board with one.
685,00:29:44.63,00:29:44.63,Whose name came up the most in answer to this question?
686,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,Who is the most honest?
687,00:29:55.83,00:29:55.83,Everybody got it?
688,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,Reveal.
689,00:30:00.90,00:30:00.90,Matthew.
690,00:30:02.00,00:30:02.00,"Matthew guessed himself. As a group,"
691,00:30:03.87,00:30:03.87,everybody said Matthew was the most honest.
692,00:30:05.37,00:30:05.37,One point for Matthew.
693,00:30:07.67,00:30:07.67,Matthew now has two.
694,00:30:08.90,00:30:08.90,Everybody else has one. Playing to five.
695,00:30:10.77,00:30:10.77,Next question:
696,00:30:12.47,00:30:12.47,"Of the seven of you, who did the group say"
697,00:30:14.70,00:30:14.70,would never survive on their own?
698,00:30:20.97,00:30:20.97,Reveal.
699,00:30:23.53,00:30:23.53,Lot of Jennas up there.
700,00:30:24.90,00:30:24.90,Jenna is the correct answer.
701,00:30:27.03,00:30:27.03,"-Jenna? -I have no idea why they said that, so..."
702,00:30:30.53,00:30:30.53,-I have no comments. -PROBST: No comments?
703,00:30:32.90,00:30:32.90,-No. -You're using sex as a weapon.
704,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,You couldn't survive on your own.
705,00:30:35.83,00:30:35.83,I-I... I don't know.
706,00:30:37.60,00:30:37.60,-Personal opinion. -PROBST: Fair enough.
707,00:30:40.40,00:30:40.40,Matthew in the lead with three.
708,00:30:42.50,00:30:42.50,"Rob, Christy, Butch have two."
709,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,"Alex, Heidi and Jenna with one."
710,00:30:48.30,00:30:48.30,Who most needs therapy?
711,00:30:52.83,00:30:52.83,Reveal.
712,00:30:57.07,00:30:57.07,"Matthew, once again, you guessed yourself, and you're right."
713,00:30:59.17,00:30:59.17,-(laughter) -MATTHEW: I'm a lunatic.
714,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,"-What could I say? -Now, does it bother you that they"
715,00:31:04.30,00:31:04.30,"-all feel that, too? -No, 'cause we joke about it"
716,00:31:06.30,00:31:06.30,"all the time, and, uh, you know,"
717,00:31:07.87,00:31:07.87,"everyone thinks I'm crazy, so... what can I say?"
718,00:31:11.13,00:31:11.13,"All right. Well, Matthew, you're in the lead with four."
719,00:31:12.87,00:31:12.87,Rob right behind at three.
720,00:31:14.80,00:31:14.80,Everybody else: two.
721,00:31:17.63,00:31:17.63,Who would you most like to see pose nude in a magazine?
722,00:31:21.83,00:31:21.83,Very curious to see what you guys say on this one.
723,00:31:24.97,00:31:24.97,Reveal.
724,00:31:30.53,00:31:30.53,Lot of Heidis up there.
725,00:31:32.20,00:31:32.20,"-Oh, great. -PROBST: Why Heidi, Alex?"
726,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,"Um, because when they got naked last time,"
727,00:31:36.53,00:31:36.53,"Jenna was right next to me, and Heidi was all the way"
728,00:31:38.70,00:31:38.70,"at the other end, so, you know,"
729,00:31:40.63,00:31:40.63,I didn't get a good view all the way at the other end.
730,00:31:43.53,00:31:43.53,-PROBST: Heidi is the correct answer. -Dang it!
731,00:31:45.67,00:31:45.67,You said Jenna.
732,00:31:47.10,00:31:47.10,Surprised they said you?
733,00:31:48.37,00:31:48.37,Yes. She's gorgeous.
734,00:31:50.53,00:31:50.53,Make you want to strut your stuff a little more?
735,00:31:52.10,00:31:52.10,-No. -JENNA: No. -PROBST: No?
736,00:31:54.47,00:31:54.47,She's just as gorgeous.
737,00:31:56.50,00:31:56.50,-Aw. -PROBST: Here's who got it right.
738,00:31:58.57,00:31:58.57,"-Heidi, you didn't. -I know."
739,00:32:01.20,00:32:01.20,"Matthew, you didn't."
740,00:32:02.77,00:32:02.77,That puts Heidi in last place with two.
741,00:32:05.63,00:32:05.63,The leaders: Matthew and Rob tied at four.
742,00:32:08.47,00:32:08.47,"Right behind them: Christy,"
743,00:32:09.97,00:32:09.97,"-Butch, Alex and Jenna, -BUTCH: Yeah."
744,00:32:12.27,00:32:12.27,each with three.
745,00:32:13.77,00:32:13.77,Matt and Rob are one question away from immunity.
746,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,Who in the tribe do you have a crush on?
747,00:32:22.20,00:32:22.20,"Whose name came up the most often in answer to the question,"
748,00:32:26.07,00:32:26.07,who do you have a crush on?
749,00:32:29.07,00:32:29.07,For immunity-- reveal.
750,00:32:35.87,00:32:35.87,Everybody said Heidi except Matthew.
751,00:32:37.23,00:32:37.23,"Matthew guessed himself, and Heidi is correct."
752,00:32:40.60,00:32:40.60,"Nice job, Rob. Rob wins immunity."
753,00:32:42.77,00:32:42.77,"Congratulations, dude."
754,00:32:44.57,00:32:44.57,"-Good job, Rob. -Good job, Rob."
755,00:32:47.40,00:32:47.40,"-Well done. -Uh, can I come get that necklace?"
756,00:32:49.23,00:32:49.23,"-Come on over, brother. -HEIDI: Good job, Rob."
757,00:32:51.10,00:32:51.10,"It's about time, baby."
758,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,Turn around. Let me put this on you.
759,00:32:54.07,00:32:54.07,This is the best day of my life.
760,00:32:55.40,00:32:55.40,"Yeah. Good job, Rob."
761,00:32:57.10,00:32:57.10,"-Yay, Rob. -PROBST: Who knew you would be"
762,00:32:58.87,00:32:58.87,the most in touch with the tribe?
763,00:33:00.43,00:33:00.43,"Oh, uh, these are my people."
764,00:33:03.37,00:33:03.37,You are their leader now.
765,00:33:04.93,00:33:04.93,"-You are safe from the vote, my friend. -Thank you."
766,00:33:06.93,00:33:06.93,But nobody else is. Everybody else vulnerable.
767,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,Rob is the only one guaranteed
768,00:33:10.43,00:33:10.43,a one-in-six shot at being the sole survivor.
769,00:33:12.53,00:33:12.53,You guys can head back to camp.
770,00:33:36.87,00:33:36.87,"Last night-- like, I-I breathed a little bit"
771,00:33:39.17,00:33:39.17,of a sigh of relief last night
772,00:33:40.80,00:33:40.80,-when Rob won. -HEIDI: When Rob won. Yeah.
773,00:33:42.47,00:33:42.47,"It was like, okay, well, I know, you know,"
774,00:33:43.60,00:33:43.60,"that Matt's going to go next,"
775,00:33:44.60,00:33:44.60,-and he's the biggest... -Yeah.
776,00:33:46.07,00:33:46.07,-he's the biggest physical threat. -Right.
777,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,"ALEX: Going to Tribal Council  tonight, and, uh..."
778,00:33:50.80,00:33:50.80,Jenna and Heidi and Rob and I
779,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,have decided that it's time for Matt to go home.
780,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,He's just way too big a physical threat.
781,00:33:59.50,00:33:59.50,Matt knows he's not going past five.
782,00:34:01.23,00:34:01.23,-ROB: Uh-huh. And he did say it? -Pretty much.
783,00:34:03.70,00:34:03.70,"Yeah, he's like, ""You know, you make it"
784,00:34:05.13,00:34:05.13,"""to six or five, that's really cool, you know."
785,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,"""I'm just going to try really hard at the immunities,"""
786,00:34:09.50,00:34:09.50,"and, well, I was like, ""You should have tried"
787,00:34:11.33,00:34:11.33,"a little harder last night."""
788,00:34:13.27,00:34:13.27,(laughing)
789,00:34:15.30,00:34:15.30,ROB: Tonight's Tribal Council  could signal
790,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50, one of the most important  power swings in this game.
791,00:34:22.47,00:34:22.47,"I could vote with Alex, Heidi and Jenna"
792,00:34:26.60,00:34:26.60,and assure myself a solid position
793,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,in the final four of this game.
794,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,"ALEX: Well, when it comes down to the four of us,"
795,00:34:33.70,00:34:33.70,"two of us are just going to, you know..."
796,00:34:35.37,00:34:35.37,whatever's going to happen is going to happen.
797,00:34:36.87,00:34:36.87,"ROB: Well, you think it'll get... it'll get ugly...?"
798,00:34:38.77,00:34:38.77,"No, I-I don't think... (stammers)"
799,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,Like... like people cutting side deals and stuff?
800,00:34:41.87,00:34:41.87,"No, I don't think so."
801,00:34:43.87,00:34:43.87,We've been honest with each other to this point.
802,00:34:46.07,00:34:46.07,"-Good. -Why... you know, why stop now?"
803,00:34:47.87,00:34:47.87,-That's how I'd like to keep it. -Yeah.
804,00:34:50.40,00:34:50.40,Or a more intriguing option might be
805,00:34:54.13,00:34:54.13," to vote with Christy,  Matt and Butch,"
806,00:34:58.40,00:34:58.40, but the downside to that  would be to lose the trust
807,00:35:01.53,00:35:01.53, of all these people  that I've come so far with.
808,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,It's possible to play the game without hurting anybody
809,00:35:06.47,00:35:06.47,-in this group. -Mm-hmm.
810,00:35:08.30,00:35:08.30,ROB: I'm turning my back  on three people
811,00:35:11.60,00:35:11.60," who potentially would be  on the jury,"
812,00:35:13.20,00:35:13.20, three people  that are definitely not
813,00:35:14.97,00:35:14.97, going to vote for me  in the final two.
814,00:35:21.70,00:35:21.70,MATTHEW: Look at those teeth.
815,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,Look at that mouth on this baby.
816,00:35:25.60,00:35:25.60,-That's so awful. -This looks like a prehis...
817,00:35:27.20,00:35:27.20,I never liked fish before.
818,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"This looks like a prehistoric, uh, fish."
819,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,Very pretty.
820,00:35:31.80,00:35:31.80,So you spoke to Rob.
821,00:35:33.37,00:35:33.37,-It's going to be good? -Yeah.
822,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90,Keep it quiet.
823,00:35:40.40,00:35:40.40,MATTHEW: Tonight is going to be  a great night.
824,00:35:44.37,00:35:44.37,I've got a strong agreement with Rob.
825,00:35:46.43,00:35:46.43, He really is the linchpin  in our plot
826,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77, this evening to dethrone Alex.
827,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60, But Rob can be very devious.
828,00:35:54.60,00:35:54.60, Rob has betrayed
829,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,a number of people to get where he is today.
830,00:36:25.13,00:36:25.13,PROBST: Now bring in the members of our jury--
831,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,"Dave and the newest member, Deena,"
832,00:36:29.30,00:36:29.30,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
833,00:36:38.30,00:36:38.30,30 days.
834,00:36:40.20,00:36:40.20,The seven of you have lasted in the Amazon 30 days.
835,00:36:45.03,00:36:45.03,Congratulations.
836,00:36:46.07,00:36:46.07,Thanks.
837,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,"PROBST: Sadly, for one of you,"
838,00:36:48.47,00:36:48.47,30 days is as good as it's going to get.
839,00:36:51.33,00:36:51.33,You'll become the third member of our jury.
840,00:36:53.03,00:36:53.03,That is what is at stake tonight.
841,00:36:54.87,00:36:54.87,"Matthew, are you surprised at how well"
842,00:36:56.87,00:36:56.87,you're doing after a month out here?
843,00:36:59.00,00:36:59.00,"Yeah. I mean, I had a pretty rough start."
844,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,"I had very little energy for a couple of weeks,"
845,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,"and I came back, and yeah,"
846,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,"I'm surprised that, uh, my health is still intact."
847,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,"PROBST: Heidi, other than"
848,00:37:10.47,00:37:10.47,"a few spider bites and things like that,"
849,00:37:12.37,00:37:12.37,you're doing relatively well.
850,00:37:13.90,00:37:13.90,"The first week was rough,"
851,00:37:15.63,00:37:15.63,"and I thought, ""Okay, if I can make it through this,"
852,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,"I can make it through anything."""
853,00:37:18.90,00:37:18.90,"And, uh, I did, and I'm still here"
854,00:37:21.70,00:37:21.70,"and feeling really, really good."
855,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,"PROBST: Alex, you gotta be feeling pretty good"
856,00:37:25.70,00:37:25.70,about how well you're doing right now.
857,00:37:27.10,00:37:27.10,You still look good.
858,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,You got a smile on your face.
859,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,30 days-- not bad.
860,00:37:30.73,00:37:30.73,I'm feeling pretty good. Um...
861,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,"I've had my rough spots out here,"
862,00:37:34.73,00:37:34.73,"but yeah, I'm feeling really good about, uh,"
863,00:37:36.87,00:37:36.87,how well I'm doing and how good I'm feeling after 30 days.
864,00:37:39.53,00:37:39.53,"PROBST: Christy, how about for you?"
865,00:37:41.53,00:37:41.53,"Now that you've weathered an entire month out here,"
866,00:37:44.37,00:37:44.37,these last nine days-- (splutters)-- piece of cake?
867,00:37:46.53,00:37:46.53,A piece of cake.
868,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,I can totally do it.
869,00:37:49.70,00:37:49.70,PROBST: Let me bring up something
870,00:37:51.20,00:37:51.20,I'm noticing sitting here.
871,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"Jenna and Heidi, you have a star--"
872,00:37:55.43,00:37:55.43,"I think a star-- on your face, and you have a heart."
873,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,-It's a sun. -HEIDI: It's a sunshine.
874,00:37:59.47,00:37:59.47,PROBST: It's a sun. Okay.
875,00:38:02.13,00:38:02.13,Are you at all concerned that by tattooing yourself
876,00:38:05.57,00:38:05.57,"with one other person, you are in a sense saying to the group,"
877,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,"""Well, I'm tight with Jenna, so just know that."""
878,00:38:11.60,00:38:11.60,"It's not a concern because, at this point in time,"
879,00:38:14.57,00:38:14.57,certain people bond more closely.
880,00:38:17.60,00:38:17.60,"You know, not just me and Heidi, you know;"
881,00:38:19.87,00:38:19.87,"maybe a couple other people, too."
882,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"PROBST: Butch, is it a risky move to make"
883,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,a demonstrative display on your face like that?
884,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"Um, sometimes I would think it is, but this time,"
885,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,"I mean, they're just... they're just together."
886,00:38:29.37,00:38:29.37,"They, um... we're included, sometimes,"
887,00:38:31.37,00:38:31.37,in some talks or casual conversation.
888,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,"We'll make comments, but on a whole,"
889,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,they're in there talking a lot together.
890,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,"PROBST: Rob, is it important in this game"
891,00:38:39.27,00:38:39.27,"to really know your tribe mates, or is it only important"
892,00:38:42.03,00:38:42.03,to know the people you're aligned with?
893,00:38:43.97,00:38:43.97,I think that the biggest part of this game
894,00:38:46.27,00:38:46.27,that often gets overlooked
895,00:38:47.93,00:38:47.93,"is interpersonal relationships, and not necessarily"
896,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,"the people that you say, ""Okay, these are my friends."""
897,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,It's getting to understand what's going through the heads
898,00:38:58.23,00:38:58.23,of everybody that's around in the game.
899,00:39:00.33,00:39:00.33,"Heidi, would you be somewhat surprised"
900,00:39:03.40,00:39:03.40,if you were voted out tonight?
901,00:39:05.03,00:39:05.03,Yes.
902,00:39:06.37,00:39:06.37,"Hmm. Alex, be a little bit surprised"
903,00:39:10.07,00:39:10.07,-if tonight it's you? -ALEX: Sure.
904,00:39:12.10,00:39:12.10,I'd be pretty surprised if I got voted out.
905,00:39:14.33,00:39:14.33,Christy.
906,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,I would not be surprised in a heartbeat.
907,00:39:18.23,00:39:18.23,"Rob, you're wearing the immunity necklace."
908,00:39:19.63,00:39:19.63,I know you don't want to give it away.
909,00:39:20.93,00:39:20.93,Rob is the only one you can't vote for.
910,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,Everybody else is on the block. It's time to vote.
911,00:39:25.33,00:39:25.33,"Christy, you're up."
912,00:39:46.10,00:39:46.10,He crossed me once.
913,00:39:47.90,00:39:47.90,I forgave him.
914,00:39:49.57,00:39:49.57,He crossed me twice.
915,00:39:51.30,00:39:51.30, I offered reconciliation.
916,00:39:54.00,00:39:54.00,His reign is over.
917,00:40:08.43,00:40:08.43,"You're way too much of a threat,"
918,00:40:09.97,00:40:09.97,"and, uh, it's time for you to go."
919,00:40:11.73,00:40:11.73," Take it easy, buddy."
920,00:40:38.23,00:40:38.23,I'll go tally the votes.
921,00:40:49.27,00:40:49.27,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
922,00:40:51.73,00:40:51.73,Person voted out will be asked
923,00:40:53.07,00:40:53.07,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
924,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,I'll read the votes.
925,00:40:58.13,00:40:58.13,First vote.
926,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,Alex.
927,00:41:04.77,00:41:04.77,Alex.
928,00:41:05.97,00:41:05.97,Two votes Alex.
929,00:41:10.33,00:41:10.33,"""Matteo."" Matt."
930,00:41:15.33,00:41:15.33,"Matt. That's two votes Matt,"
931,00:41:17.40,00:41:17.40,two votes Alex.
932,00:41:22.23,00:41:22.23,"Matt. Three votes Matt,"
933,00:41:24.23,00:41:24.23,two votes Alex.
934,00:41:28.57,00:41:28.57,Alex.
935,00:41:30.50,00:41:30.50,"Three votes Alex, three votes Matt."
936,00:41:33.80,00:41:33.80,I'll read the last vote.
937,00:41:37.57,00:41:37.57,Tenth person voted out of the tribe
938,00:41:39.27,00:41:39.27,and the third member of our jury:
939,00:41:42.20,00:41:42.20,Alex.
940,00:41:44.00,00:41:44.00,Need to bring me your torch.
941,00:41:58.20,00:41:58.20,"Alex, the tribe has spoken."
942,00:42:02.37,00:42:02.37,"Take it easy, you guys."
943,00:42:04.07,00:42:04.07,"MATTHEW: Good luck. Good luck, dude."
944,00:42:16.77,00:42:16.77,"Well, judging by the looks on your faces,"
945,00:42:19.67,00:42:19.67,I'd say that tonight's vote
946,00:42:21.27,00:42:21.27,was certainly a surprise to at least a few of you.
947,00:42:23.03,00:42:23.03,I guess there is a lot of talking
948,00:42:24.53,00:42:24.53,"to be done, once you get back to camp."
949,00:42:26.23,00:42:26.23,You guys can head back.
950,00:42:27.73,00:42:27.73,Good night.
951,00:42:40.27,00:42:40.27,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.

954,00:42:51.20,00:42:51.20,You don't care about personal relationships.
955,00:42:52.43,00:42:52.43,You just care about yourself.
956,00:42:53.77,00:42:53.77,Please feel free to write R-O-B
957,00:42:56.13,00:42:56.13,on your parchment tomorrow night.
958,00:42:58.50,00:42:58.50,PROBST: Until a reward challenge  changes the mood.
959,00:43:01.30,00:43:01.30,One of you will win a visit from your loved one.
960,00:43:11.37,00:43:11.37,"Wow. Uh, you guys got me."
961,00:43:13.23,00:43:13.23,I don't know who on my alliance  flipped on me.
962,00:43:15.63,00:43:15.63, I-I think it was probably Rob.
963,00:43:17.17,00:43:17.17," Hey, you know,  I played the game"
964,00:43:18.77,00:43:18.77," as best I could, and, uh,"
965,00:43:20.33,00:43:20.33," apparently, I was the biggest  threat at this point, so..."
966,00:43:22.87,00:43:22.87," I'm going to go get a shower,  get some food,"
967,00:43:25.57,00:43:25.57," and, uh, be back to see  these guys in three days."
968,00:43:28.20,00:43:28.20, There you go. That's it.
969,00:43:30.13,00:43:30.13,Take it easy.
