4,00:00:05.93,00:00:05.93,"Butch is on, seriously,on a need-to-know basis."

6,00:00:10.73,00:00:10.73,"from, like, a chain-link."
7,00:00:12.50,00:00:12.50," Matt was afraid of being viewed as a threat,"
8,00:00:15.13,00:00:15.13, but it didn't matter when Alex hit the mark
9,00:00:17.50,00:00:17.50,-and won the reward challenge. -Alex is drinking coffee!
10,00:00:20.60,00:00:20.60, And he invited Jenna to enjoy coffee and pastries.
11,00:00:24.20,00:00:24.20,-This... is so nice.-Mm. Mm.
12,00:00:26.37,00:00:26.37,"To you, for winning."
13,00:00:27.93,00:00:27.93," Back at camp, Deena wasconcerned about Alex's victory."
14,00:00:31.27,00:00:31.27,DEENA: We don't have a chanceif Alex is in this game.
15,00:00:34.53,00:00:34.53,"PROBST: With Alex and Jenna back from the reward,"
16,00:00:36.97,00:00:36.97, Heidi revealed Deena's plan.
17,00:00:39.70,00:00:39.70,HEIDI: Alex and Jenna were my original alliance.
18,00:00:41.50,00:00:41.50,I'm not gonnaturn my back on them.
19,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,"PROBST: That night, Heidi was bit by a spider."
20,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,It's getting bad.
21,00:00:46.67,00:00:46.67, So she had to be carried
22,00:00:48.30,00:00:48.30," to the immunity challenge by Alex,"
23,00:00:50.23,00:00:50.23, where the tribe got a taste of the Amazon.
24,00:00:52.40,00:00:52.40,(crunching)
25,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,PROBST:Keep it down.
26,00:00:55.37,00:00:55.37, When a live beetle larva was more
27,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33, -than Deena could stomach... -That is just nasty-ass!
28,00:01:00.10,00:01:00.10,-Go! -...she felt secure enough to give up immunity...
29,00:01:03.20,00:01:03.20,You are safefrom the vote tonight.
30,00:01:04.80,00:01:04.80,-Cool.-Nice effort.
31,00:01:05.93,00:01:05.93, ...but was shocked
32,00:01:07.27,00:01:07.27," at Tribal Council when her alliance of Alex,"
33,00:01:09.53,00:01:09.53," Heidi, Jenna and Rob turned the tables on her."
34,00:01:12.80,00:01:12.80,Ninth person voted out

37,00:01:20.23,00:01:20.23, Seven remain.
38,00:01:21.37,00:01:21.37, Who will be voted out tonight?
39,00:02:50.27,00:02:50.27,ALEX:The buff-- the multipurp--
40,00:02:52.20,00:02:52.20,-the multipurpose accessory.-No kidding.
41,00:02:53.83,00:02:53.83,I still haven'tworn it as a tube top.
42,00:02:56.87,00:02:56.87,"JENNA: You wear it as a tubetop, I'll wear it as a skirt."
43,00:03:00.20,00:03:00.20,"-I know, that'd be fun.-Then we'll be"
44,00:03:01.80,00:03:01.80,-like the Bobbsey Twins.-(laughs)
45,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,ALEX: Jenna and Heidi and Rob and I are having a blast.
46,00:03:07.00,00:03:07.00,"Game-wise, it'sworking out great for us,"
47,00:03:08.77,00:03:08.77,"'cause we have a majority,"
48,00:03:10.20,00:03:10.20," and as long as  we control immunity,"
49,00:03:12.27,00:03:12.27, it's the four of us that are the final four.
50,00:03:14.37,00:03:14.37,ROB: Catch any fish today?
51,00:03:16.70,00:03:16.70,JENNA: No.
52,00:03:17.93,00:03:17.93,ROB: One of them's gonna get fired
53,00:03:19.37,00:03:19.37, -if they don't soon. -In three days?
54,00:03:21.07,00:03:21.07,Yeah. They'refalling behind on what
55,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,they need to bedoing around here.
56,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,"There's no firewood,"
57,00:03:26.13,00:03:26.13,-there's no fish.-(laughing)
58,00:03:28.43,00:03:28.43,-JENNA: They need to gettheir acts together. -Yeah.
59,00:03:30.57,00:03:30.57,"I'm booked all day,thinking of funny things to say."
60,00:03:33.63,00:03:33.63,JENNA:And I'm booked all day trying
61,00:03:35.03,00:03:35.03,to figure out a really cooloutfit to wear to the challenge.
62,00:03:37.00,00:03:37.00,ALEX: I'm enjoying this game a lot.
63,00:03:39.27,00:03:39.27," I mean, I knew that I would meet cool people;"
64,00:03:40.73,00:03:40.73, I never thought that I would meet people that
65,00:03:42.43,00:03:42.43,I consider friends that I wantto continue to be friends with.
66,00:03:46.87,00:03:46.87,"JENNA: Like,I consider you three, like,"
67,00:03:49.57,00:03:49.57,"-my best friends, like,-HEIDI: That's it."
68,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,"in and out of the game, though."
69,00:03:52.47,00:03:52.47,"And not just here;like, at home."
70,00:03:54.37,00:03:54.37,I'm an only child; I'mso close with my mom and dad.
71,00:03:56.97,00:03:56.97," Like, I just sit at home and chill with them,"
72,00:03:58.97,00:03:58.97," like, almost every night of the week"
73,00:04:00.43,00:04:00.43, and just eat and have fun.
74,00:04:02.03,00:04:02.03, I miss them.
75,00:04:03.53,00:04:03.53,"Plus, my mom's not well."
76,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,"I left her, and she's..."
77,00:04:06.77,00:04:06.77,"you know, hopefully doingreally well while I'm gone."
78,00:04:10.83,00:04:10.83,HEIDI: Jenna's mom is sick.
79,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83," She has cancer. I mean,"
80,00:04:14.60,00:04:14.60,we haven't heardfrom our families
81,00:04:16.10,00:04:16.10,in gosh knows how long.(laughs)
82,00:04:17.87,00:04:17.87,"So, I mean, it's scary."
83,00:04:19.60,00:04:19.60, And Jenna's just worried sick.
84,00:04:22.10,00:04:22.10,"JENNA: I think about them often,"
85,00:04:24.27,00:04:24.27,but it's nice to havea core group of people
86,00:04:26.70,00:04:26.70,"that I love here, also,"
87,00:04:28.23,00:04:28.23,that's also made me not haveto think about them as often.
88,00:04:31.40,00:04:31.40,That really helps;it really does.
89,00:04:46.63,00:04:46.63,ALEX: It's a little bit like...
90,00:04:49.33,00:04:49.33,"and I hate to say it, but it'sa little bit like high school."
91,00:04:52.23,00:04:52.23,"Jenna and Heidi, Rob and I have"
92,00:04:53.90,00:04:53.90, the luxury of doing a little less work
93,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97," because we hold a majority, and the other three know it."
94,00:05:00.83,00:05:00.83,"CHRISTY: I am a hard worker,"
95,00:05:03.33,00:05:03.33,and I know I'm a hard workerand I don't mind working hard.
96,00:05:06.47,00:05:06.47,(wood clatters loudly)
97,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67," But sometimes it's, like, come on, get off your butt"
98,00:05:09.63,00:05:09.63, and go and get some wood or go and try to do something.
99,00:05:13.10,00:05:13.10,And they just do jack ...
100,00:05:19.77,00:05:19.77,Hey!
101,00:05:22.03,00:05:22.03,What am I missing?
102,00:05:23.70,00:05:23.70,MATTHEW: I find their behavior to be...
103,00:05:26.10,00:05:26.10, incomprehensible.
104,00:05:31.97,00:05:31.97, Maybe the final four will be made up
105,00:05:33.60,00:05:33.60," of Rob, Alex, Jenna and Heidi, but..."
106,00:05:36.60,00:05:36.60, by betraying the other three members of the tribe
107,00:05:39.87,00:05:39.87,"and treating them like dirt,"
108,00:05:41.70,00:05:41.70,they've basically guaranteed
109,00:05:43.50,00:05:43.50," that myself, Butch and Christy will vote against them"
110,00:05:46.30,00:05:46.30, if any one of them makes it to the final two.
111,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,BUTCH:That's just...
112,00:05:50.87,00:05:50.87,ridiculous.
113,00:06:04.30,00:06:04.30,"ROB:Wait, hold on."
114,00:06:05.47,00:06:05.47,(laughs)We have money!
115,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30,-It is!-(happy screaming)
116,00:06:10.23,00:06:10.23,"Oh, my God!"
117,00:06:11.37,00:06:11.37,(screaming)
118,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,"Oh, my God! I have money!"

123,00:06:22.93,00:06:22.93,I can't even control myself.
124,00:06:24.43,00:06:24.43,"ROB:""Easy come, easy go,"
125,00:06:25.83,00:06:25.83,"""you're invited to comeand play, you will compete"
126,00:06:27.80,00:06:27.80,"to get some treats,but soon the offer goes away."""
127,00:06:29.47,00:06:29.47,Does that mean we all
128,00:06:30.73,00:06:30.73,"get something,or is this a joke?"
129,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20, The treemail said something like
130,00:06:33.57,00:06:33.57,"they're gonna auction off,you know,"

135,00:06:45.37,00:06:45.37,"JENNA: I said, do we getto keep the extra?"

404,00:17:09.10,00:17:09.10,but I definitelycan trust people at home.
405,00:17:36.27,00:17:36.27,-JENNA (sobbing): It shrunk.-HEIDI: It's okay.
406,00:17:38.73,00:17:38.73,It shrunk.
407,00:17:40.10,00:17:40.10,-Her tumor shrunk 50%.-Nice.
408,00:17:42.47,00:17:42.47,It's almost gone.
409,00:17:44.17,00:17:44.17,(sobbing)
410,00:17:46.00,00:17:46.00,HEIDI: She started crying because her mom had written
411,00:17:48.93,00:17:48.93, that the brain tumor had decreased by 50%.
412,00:17:53.43,00:17:53.43," I mean, it was just, like,"
413,00:17:55.00,00:17:55.00,one of the greatest things.
414,00:17:56.30,00:17:56.30,I started cryingbecause I was so happy for her.
415,00:17:58.57,00:17:58.57,"-ALEX: That's fantastic.-JENNA: Yeah, it is."
416,00:18:00.63,00:18:00.63,"ROB:Yeah, that's so great."
417,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,JENNA: Hearing from my family--
418,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00, my mom and dad-- it's just...
419,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,better than anythingI could've ever asked for.
420,00:18:09.50,00:18:09.50,It just helps you move on.
421,00:18:11.63,00:18:11.63,I just need to hear
422,00:18:12.97,00:18:12.97," about how they were and what they're doing,"
423,00:18:15.27,00:18:15.27, and it's hard.
424,00:18:17.70,00:18:17.70,But I'm glad.It really was the best thing.
425,00:18:19.63,00:18:19.63,"ROB: Yeah, that's so great."
426,00:18:20.97,00:18:20.97,-That's enough for me.-HEIDI: That is so great.
427,00:18:22.83,00:18:22.83,"-Thanks, guys.-That is so great."
428,00:18:24.47,00:18:24.47,-Thank you.-That is great.
429,00:18:50.17,00:18:50.17,There's a lot of meaton this one.
430,00:18:52.20,00:18:52.20,"MATTHEW: Yep, that's...that's a breakfast, dude."
431,00:18:54.07,00:18:54.07,That is a beautiful fish.
432,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,We haven't eaten that fish yet.
433,00:19:02.10,00:19:02.10,(whispering): I thinkthat we've got a great shot
434,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,if we work on Rob today
435,00:19:07.80,00:19:07.80,and get him to comeover to our side.
436,00:19:11.77,00:19:11.77,MATTHEW: Right now is a critical time.
437,00:19:14.37,00:19:14.37,There are a number of subgroups that have formed.
438,00:19:18.07,00:19:18.07,"One potential subgroup consists of Alex, Heidi and Jenna,"
439,00:19:23.07,00:19:23.07, and then there's Rob.
440,00:19:25.43,00:19:25.43,"(whispering): I think that ifwe can get Rob to join us,"
441,00:19:27.97,00:19:27.97,that'll give us four powerfulvotes in Tribal Council.
442,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,It's got to be obvious to Robthat he's expendable if he...
443,00:19:35.13,00:19:35.13,if he aligns himself with Alex.
444,00:19:36.67,00:19:36.67,BUTCH: We don't want to get in too big of a hurry.
445,00:19:39.83,00:19:39.83,We don't want to rush this.
446,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,"We don't want to try andget it all done right now,"
447,00:19:43.33,00:19:43.33,"because, then,sometimes it leaks out."
448,00:19:44.83,00:19:44.83,We can approach Christylater on.
449,00:19:46.23,00:19:46.23,I can do that very delicately.
450,00:19:47.97,00:19:47.97,"Because, right now, I mean,she said"
451,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,"she doesn't trust anyone,"
452,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80,but I've had a lotof very good conversations
453,00:19:53.20,00:19:53.20,"-with her, and I like her.-All right."
454,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,"All right, let's get back,'cause I don't want them"
455,00:19:56.67,00:19:56.67,to come downand see us talking this close.
456,00:19:58.93,00:19:58.93,"MATTHEW: I think that we've got a great shot,"
457,00:20:02.03,00:20:02.03," assuming, uh... once they join us."
458,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,"Otherwise, Butchand I and Christy will go"
459,00:20:08.20,00:20:08.20,over the next threeTribal Councils.
460,00:20:21.93,00:20:21.93,(fire crackling)
461,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,-How'd you sleep?-Slept well.
462,00:20:48.00,00:20:48.00,"So, Rob, I was thinking,"
463,00:20:50.03,00:20:50.03,"if the four of us goto the final four,"
464,00:20:53.10,00:20:53.10,I know that those twohave sworn to each other
465,00:20:54.80,00:20:54.80,-they're never going to votefor each other. -Mm-hmm.
466,00:20:56.93,00:20:56.93,"-So, the way I see it,-Mm-hmm."
467,00:20:59.53,00:20:59.53,"if I win immunity,my vote goes for you,"
468,00:21:02.93,00:21:02.93,"and I'm sure that ifyou win immunity,"
469,00:21:04.90,00:21:04.90,"you're going to vote me off,and that's totally cool."
470,00:21:07.30,00:21:07.30,-I'm down. It's no worries.-Okay.
471,00:21:10.43,00:21:10.43,Alex's decision to tell me
472,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,that he was going to vote me out
473,00:21:14.60,00:21:14.60,at the final four is really
474,00:21:17.90,00:21:17.90, kind of curious.
475,00:21:19.23,00:21:19.23, I think it has to do with this idea
476,00:21:22.30,00:21:22.30," that we're all each other's best friends,"
477,00:21:24.27,00:21:24.27," and even though I'm going to be voted out fourth,"
478,00:21:26.43,00:21:26.43,I'm losing to threeworthy players.
479,00:21:30.77,00:21:30.77,"ALEX: And if one of themwins immunity,"
480,00:21:32.30,00:21:32.30,"then that's a whole notherball of wax,"
481,00:21:34.00,00:21:34.00,and I don't know... I-I don'tknow what... what happens then.
482,00:21:36.07,00:21:36.07,"But I'm just sayingbetween you and I,"
483,00:21:38.33,00:21:38.33,'cause we've been downwith each other
484,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,"from the very beginning,and I'll be honest with you"
485,00:21:41.67,00:21:41.67,"and just straight-up, and say..."
486,00:21:43.63,00:21:43.63,"you know, I mean,'cause these two are never"
487,00:21:45.77,00:21:45.77,going to voteagainst each other.
488,00:21:46.90,00:21:46.90,"-They told me as much, you know?-Right."
489,00:21:48.63,00:21:48.63,"They've sworn their livesto each other, so..."
490,00:21:50.63,00:21:50.63,"that's, you know...?"
491,00:21:52.40,00:21:52.40,So whatever happens at fourhappens.
492,00:21:54.37,00:21:54.37,-You know what I mean?-Uh-huh.
493,00:21:56.13,00:21:56.13,Are you cool with that?
494,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,ROB: I realize that I've been coming off
495,00:22:00.53,00:22:00.53," as very sensitive with this group,"
496,00:22:02.40,00:22:02.40,talking about how muchI love them and how much
497,00:22:04.47,00:22:04.47,"I'm going to be friendswith them aft-after the game,"
498,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,"but I have never stoppedplaying Survivor,"
499,00:22:09.90,00:22:09.90, and over my dead body will I turn over
500,00:22:12.57,00:22:12.57, and let somebody just pass me by.
501,00:22:14.60,00:22:14.60,"All right, well,we'll cross that bridge"
502,00:22:16.20,00:22:16.20,-when we come to it.-Yeah.
503,00:22:25.77,00:22:25.77,(snorting)
504,00:22:28.03,00:22:28.03,(hissing)
505,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"Bad news, guys.It's the S.A.T.s."
506,00:22:43.10,00:22:43.10,-(laughter)-Okay.
507,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,"ALEX:We received a very interesting,"
508,00:22:46.13,00:22:46.13," uh, little treemail this morning."
509,00:22:48.13,00:22:48.13," There was big test booklets with each of our name on it,"
510,00:22:51.30,00:22:51.30," and it said to answer all the questions,"
511,00:22:53.40,00:22:53.40,to not discuss itwith anyone.
512,00:22:55.33,00:22:55.33,"""This is a confidential document"
513,00:22:57.53,00:22:57.53,"""which your fellow tribe memberswill never see,"
514,00:22:59.73,00:22:59.73,"so please answer honestly."""
515,00:23:01.27,00:23:01.27," It's... obviously, it means some kind of a game"
516,00:23:03.20,00:23:03.20, to see if your answers match
517,00:23:04.70,00:23:04.70,"everyone else's--we think, anyway."
518,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83," So it should be interesting,"
519,00:23:08.07,00:23:08.07," when we get to the immunity challenge,"
520,00:23:09.23,00:23:09.23, to see how our answers are used.
521,00:23:13.10,00:23:13.10,"CHRISTY: Some questions were easy to answer, like,"
522,00:23:16.53,00:23:16.53,"""Who is the biggestdrama king or queen?"" You know?"
523,00:23:19.60,00:23:19.60," Then it got to some, like, ""Who needs therapy?"""
524,00:23:23.00,00:23:23.00," Or, ""Who is the tribe slob?"""
525,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"It made me more aware and, like,"
526,00:23:26.83,00:23:26.83,"really, like,think about who's who."
527,00:23:31.93,00:23:31.93,ROB: The treemail was sort of a slam book-type quiz.
528,00:23:37.50,00:23:37.50," Things like, uh,"
529,00:23:38.83,00:23:38.83,"""Who would you trustwith your life?"""
530,00:23:41.03,00:23:41.03,And a bunchof very interesting questions
531,00:23:43.43,00:23:43.43,that really got me thinkingabout a number of things.
532,00:23:50.67,00:23:50.67,"Matt, this is the mostimportant conversation..."
533,00:23:52.10,00:23:52.10,Yep.
534,00:23:53.10,00:23:53.10,...that I'm goingto have with you
535,00:23:54.73,00:23:54.73,-in this entire game.-In this game.
536,00:23:56.17,00:23:56.17,MATTHEW: Rob and I had perhaps the most
537,00:23:58.17,00:23:58.17,important conversationof the game.
538,00:24:01.23,00:24:01.23," He sat me down, and he said, ""Matthew,"
539,00:24:03.60,00:24:03.60," ""I'm going to lay out what has happened"
540,00:24:05.53,00:24:05.53,"over the past couple of weeks."""
541,00:24:07.93,00:24:07.93,"-First, I need to come cleanwith you. -Okay."
542,00:24:10.43,00:24:10.43,"Once we got to Jacaré,"
543,00:24:12.87,00:24:12.87,I had been telling you
544,00:24:14.53,00:24:14.53,that the menwere going to stick together
545,00:24:16.43,00:24:16.43,"after we got ridof Roger and Dave,"
546,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,-but that wasn't true.-Right.
547,00:24:20.07,00:24:20.07,"I'm telling you this becauseI know that you trust me,"
548,00:24:23.23,00:24:23.23,-Sure. -...and I don't wantto tell you any more lies.
549,00:24:25.67,00:24:25.67,-Sure. Okay. -I swear that thisis the honest truth.
550,00:24:28.80,00:24:28.80,"MATTHEW: He said that there had been a lot of, uh,"
551,00:24:31.17,00:24:31.17," times when I had been in danger,"
552,00:24:32.80,00:24:32.80, and people that I thought were on my side
553,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83," were actually plotting against me,"
554,00:24:36.63,00:24:36.63,"and on several occasions,"
555,00:24:37.80,00:24:37.80,he was includedand was stringing me along.
556,00:24:40.27,00:24:40.27,"Dude, you are...are the only person"
557,00:24:41.70,00:24:41.70,I really trust in this game--
558,00:24:43.10,00:24:43.10,"-and Butch now, because hehas no options. -Well... yes."
559,00:24:45.50,00:24:45.50,That's going to change.
560,00:24:47.27,00:24:47.27,"MATTHEW: Rob can be very underhanded,"
561,00:24:50.07,00:24:50.07," but I appreciated his honesty, and I appreciated"
562,00:24:54.63,00:24:54.63,what he had to say next.
563,00:24:55.90,00:24:55.90,Alex is the power player here.
564,00:24:57.70,00:24:57.70,He thinks that you'rethe only person
565,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,"that can beat himin a physical competition,"
566,00:25:00.87,00:25:00.87,and that's why he...he wants you to go.
567,00:25:02.73,00:25:02.73,"And Alex told me yesterdaythat when we get to four,"
568,00:25:06.13,00:25:06.13,he's going to vote against me.
569,00:25:07.73,00:25:07.73,He said that to you?
570,00:25:09.13,00:25:09.13,Yes. This is what happens
571,00:25:10.47,00:25:10.47,-when people startbeing arrogant. -Right.
572,00:25:12.90,00:25:12.90,It's hubris.
573,00:25:14.03,00:25:14.03,MATTHEW: I was appalled
574,00:25:16.13,00:25:16.13,"at their audacity,"
575,00:25:17.53,00:25:17.53,that they would go so faras to say that...
576,00:25:21.00,00:25:21.00,"that Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Robhad wrapped it all up"
577,00:25:24.57,00:25:24.57,and that it was merelya question
578,00:25:26.30,00:25:26.30,of which one of the fourwould win a million dollars.
579,00:25:29.40,00:25:29.40,"Me, you, Butch and Christyvote out Alex tomorrow."
580,00:25:31.63,00:25:31.63,That's what I was thinking.
581,00:25:33.30,00:25:33.30,"If Alex wins immunity, I don'tknow what we're going to do."
582,00:25:35.20,00:25:35.20,"Well, dude,I'll give you my word..."
583,00:25:36.67,00:25:36.67,I'll give you my word on my...
584,00:25:38.20,00:25:38.20,"I'll give my only word I'mever going to give in this game,"
585,00:25:40.23,00:25:40.23,-Mm-hmm. -...and I...I appreciate what you've said.
586,00:25:41.80,00:25:41.80,I will not betray you.And you know what?
587,00:25:43.53,00:25:43.53,"If it falls through,then I'm out,"
588,00:25:45.73,00:25:45.73,"-but you're it, so...-Right. Well, we're both..."
589,00:25:47.57,00:25:47.57,-we're both out if thisfalls through. -Okay.
590,00:25:49.00,00:25:49.00,"MATTHEW: I do have a lot of survival skills,"
591,00:25:51.57,00:25:51.57, but I am very ignorant when it comes to...
592,00:25:54.80,00:25:54.80, the game and how it's played.
593,00:25:56.90,00:25:56.90," Rob has zero survival skills,"
594,00:25:59.53,00:25:59.53,but knows the gameinside and out.
595,00:26:01.40,00:26:01.40,"I can get... get Christy,no problem."
596,00:26:03.30,00:26:03.30,"-She hates the two girls.-Alex? Okay, great."
597,00:26:05.60,00:26:05.60,"-And I think shehates Alex, too. -Okay."
598,00:26:07.53,00:26:07.53,ROB: I am very aware
599,00:26:08.93,00:26:08.93,"of the arrogance of my alliance,"
600,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,and I think thatis going to help me here.
601,00:26:14.30,00:26:14.30, And I don't think it's going to be very difficult
602,00:26:16.97,00:26:16.97, to sway the opinions of the three people
603,00:26:18.43,00:26:18.43, that aren't in this alliance.
604,00:26:22.80,00:26:22.80,What?
605,00:26:24.20,00:26:24.20,-What are you smiling about?-Nothing.

608,00:26:31.23,00:26:31.23, but she does not fit in with this group.
609,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83, I have a feeling that a lot of girls
610,00:26:35.40,00:26:35.40, that were like Jenna and Heidi
611,00:26:37.10,00:26:37.10,were very mean to Christyin her... in her life.
612,00:26:40.77,00:26:40.77,CHRISTY:So what are you thinking?
613,00:26:42.20,00:26:42.20,All I assumewas the four of you guys
614,00:26:43.83,00:26:43.83,"made a pact, and just,like, you guys"
615,00:26:45.33,00:26:45.33,"are going all the way,so I'm going to be gone"

617,00:26:48.07,00:26:48.07,I don't trust Alex anymore.
618,00:26:49.13,00:26:49.13,"He's lied and changed his story,"
619,00:26:51.33,00:26:51.33,"a number of times,on what he's going to do."
620,00:26:54.30,00:26:54.30,So are you thinkingof trying to get
621,00:26:56.07,00:26:56.07,"Butch, Matt, you and meto vote them out?"
622,00:26:58.40,00:26:58.40,-To vote off Alex.-Oh.
623,00:26:59.90,00:26:59.90,I-I-I'm up for voting Alex out.
624,00:27:02.03,00:27:02.03,-I knew you would be.-'Cause I don't think
625,00:27:04.10,00:27:04.10,"he plays fair, personally."
626,00:27:06.03,00:27:06.03,"I'm, like, ""Dude, I'm with you."
627,00:27:07.50,00:27:07.50,"I'm with you to get Alex out,""just because Alex..."
628,00:27:10.50,00:27:10.50,"Aah! I could care lessabout him, and I just..."
629,00:27:13.63,00:27:13.63,"Ugh! And he's...he's just, like..."
630,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03," drooling over Jenna and Heidi, and it's just, like, come on!"
631,00:27:20.73,00:27:20.73," Then again, I don't know. Can you really trust Rob?"
632,00:27:23.63,00:27:23.63,"Is he really going to say thatto make us feel like,"
633,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,"well, we actually have a chance,"
634,00:27:27.50,00:27:27.50,or is he just tryingto stir up something?
635,00:27:36.90,00:27:36.90,"Come on in, guys."
636,00:27:43.13,00:27:43.13,"Okay, at this point,down to seven people."

638,00:27:47.87,00:27:47.87,of what is going onwithin the tribe is critical.
639,00:27:50.27,00:27:50.27,"The more you knowabout your tribe mates,"
640,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77,"chances are, the betteryou're going to do."
641,00:27:54.77,00:27:54.77,That brings usto tonight's immunity challenge.
642,00:27:56.90,00:27:56.90,"This morning,you were given questionnaires."
643,00:27:58.67,00:27:58.67,You answered the questions.I've tallied the results.

656,00:28:39.67,00:28:39.67,That's a pretty big statement.
657,00:28:41.13,00:28:41.13,"Really makes mefeel good, and I would..."
658,00:28:42.57,00:28:42.57,"I would, um,do my best to do it."
659,00:28:45.20,00:28:45.20,And you answered yourself.

677,00:29:29.00,00:29:29.00,I don't thinkit's done purposely
678,00:29:30.63,00:29:30.63,"to try to, you know,snake anybody, but..."
679,00:29:32.93,00:29:32.93,maybe by accident?
680,00:29:34.90,00:29:34.90,(chuckles) Said with a...an adorable smile.
681,00:29:36.60,00:29:36.60,See? That's the thing.Okay.

790,00:34:22.47,00:34:22.47,"I could vote with Alex,Heidi and Jenna"
791,00:34:26.60,00:34:26.60,and assure myselfa solid position
792,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,in the final four of this game.

800,00:34:43.87,00:34:43.87,We've been honestwith each other to this point.
801,00:34:46.07,00:34:46.07,"-Good.-Why... you know, why stop now?"
802,00:34:47.87,00:34:47.87,-That's how I'd liketo keep it. -Yeah.
803,00:34:50.40,00:34:50.40,Or a more intriguing optionmight be
804,00:34:54.13,00:34:54.13," to vote with Christy, Matt and Butch,"
805,00:34:58.40,00:34:58.40, but the downside to that would be to lose the trust
806,00:35:01.53,00:35:01.53, of all these people that I've come so far with.
807,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,It's possible to play the gamewithout hurting anybody
808,00:35:06.47,00:35:06.47,-in this group.-Mm-hmm.
809,00:35:08.30,00:35:08.30,ROB: I'm turning my back on three people
810,00:35:11.60,00:35:11.60," who potentially would be on the jury,"
811,00:35:13.20,00:35:13.20, three people that are definitely not
812,00:35:14.97,00:35:14.97, going to vote for me in the final two.
813,00:35:21.70,00:35:21.70,MATTHEW:Look at those teeth.
814,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,Look at that mouth on this baby.
815,00:35:25.60,00:35:25.60,-That's so awful.-This looks like a prehis...
816,00:35:27.20,00:35:27.20,I never liked fish before.
817,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"This looks likea prehistoric, uh, fish."
818,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,Very pretty.
819,00:35:31.80,00:35:31.80,So you spoke to Rob.
820,00:35:33.37,00:35:33.37,-It's going to be good?-Yeah.
821,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90,Keep it quiet.
822,00:35:40.40,00:35:40.40,MATTHEW: Tonight is going to be a great night.
823,00:35:44.37,00:35:44.37,I've got a strong agreementwith Rob.
824,00:35:46.43,00:35:46.43, He really is the linchpin in our plot
825,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77, this evening to dethrone Alex.
826,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60, But Rob can be very devious.
827,00:35:54.60,00:35:54.60, Rob has betrayed
828,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,a number of peopleto get where he is today.
829,00:36:25.13,00:36:25.13,PROBST: Now bring inthe members of our jury--

841,00:36:56.87,00:36:56.87,you're doingafter a month out here?
842,00:36:59.00,00:36:59.00,"Yeah. I mean,I had a pretty rough start."
843,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,"I had very little energyfor a couple of weeks,"
844,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,"and I came back, and yeah,"
845,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,"I'm surprised that, uh,my health is still intact."
846,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,"PROBST:Heidi, other than"
847,00:37:10.47,00:37:10.47,"a few spider bitesand things like that,"
848,00:37:12.37,00:37:12.37,you're doing relatively well.
849,00:37:13.90,00:37:13.90,"The first week was rough,"
850,00:37:15.63,00:37:15.63,"and I thought, ""Okay,if I can make it through this,"
851,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,"I can make it through anything."""
852,00:37:18.90,00:37:18.90,"And, uh, I did,and I'm still here"
853,00:37:21.70,00:37:21.70,"and feeling really, really good."
854,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,"PROBST: Alex, you gotta befeeling pretty good"

857,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,You got a smile on your face.
858,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,30 days-- not bad.
859,00:37:30.73,00:37:30.73,I'm feeling pretty good.Um...
860,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,"I've had my rough spotsout here,"
861,00:37:34.73,00:37:34.73,"but yeah, I'm feelingreally good about, uh,"
862,00:37:36.87,00:37:36.87,how well I'm doing and how goodI'm feeling after 30 days.
863,00:37:39.53,00:37:39.53,"PROBST:Christy, how about for you?"
864,00:37:41.53,00:37:41.53,"Now that you've weatheredan entire month out here,"
865,00:37:44.37,00:37:44.37,these last nine days--(splutters)-- piece of cake?
866,00:37:46.53,00:37:46.53,A piece of cake.
867,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,I can totally do it.
868,00:37:49.70,00:37:49.70,PROBST:Let me bring up something
869,00:37:51.20,00:37:51.20,I'm noticing sitting here.
870,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"Jenna and Heidi,you have a star--"
871,00:37:55.43,00:37:55.43,"I think a star-- on your face,and you have a heart."
872,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,-It's a sun.-HEIDI: It's a sunshine.
873,00:37:59.47,00:37:59.47,PROBST:It's a sun. Okay.
874,00:38:02.13,00:38:02.13,Are you at all concernedthat by tattooing yourself
875,00:38:05.57,00:38:05.57,"with one other person, you arein a sense saying to the group,"
876,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,"""Well, I'm tight with Jenna,so just know that."""
877,00:38:11.60,00:38:11.60,"It's not a concern because,at this point in time,"
878,00:38:14.57,00:38:14.57,certain people bondmore closely.
879,00:38:17.60,00:38:17.60,"You know, not just meand Heidi, you know;"
880,00:38:19.87,00:38:19.87,"maybe a couple otherpeople, too."
881,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"PROBST: Butch, is ita risky move to make"
882,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,a demonstrative displayon your face like that?
883,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"Um, sometimes I would thinkit is, but this time,"
884,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,"I mean, they're just...they're just together."
885,00:38:29.37,00:38:29.37,"They, um...we're included, sometimes,"
886,00:38:31.37,00:38:31.37,in some talksor casual conversation.
887,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,"We'll make comments,but on a whole,"
888,00:38:35.20,00:38:35.20,they're in theretalking a lot together.
889,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,"PROBST: Rob, is itimportant in this game"
890,00:38:39.27,00:38:39.27,"to really know your tribe mates,or is it only important"
891,00:38:42.03,00:38:42.03,to know the peopleyou're aligned with?
892,00:38:43.97,00:38:43.97,I think that the biggest partof this game
893,00:38:46.27,00:38:46.27,that often gets overlooked
894,00:38:47.93,00:38:47.93,"is interpersonal relationships,and not necessarily"
895,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,"the people that you say,""Okay, these are my friends."""
896,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,It's getting to understandwhat's going through the heads
897,00:38:58.23,00:38:58.23,of everybodythat's around in the game.
898,00:39:00.33,00:39:00.33,"Heidi, would you besomewhat surprised"
899,00:39:03.40,00:39:03.40,if you were voted out tonight?
900,00:39:05.03,00:39:05.03,Yes.
901,00:39:06.37,00:39:06.37,"Hmm. Alex, bea little bit surprised"
902,00:39:10.07,00:39:10.07,-if tonight it's you?-ALEX: Sure.
903,00:39:12.10,00:39:12.10,I'd be pretty surprisedif I got voted out.
904,00:39:14.33,00:39:14.33,Christy.
905,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,I would not be surprisedin a heartbeat.
906,00:39:18.23,00:39:18.23,"Rob, you're wearingthe immunity necklace."
907,00:39:19.63,00:39:19.63,I know you don't wantto give it away.
908,00:39:20.93,00:39:20.93,Rob is the only oneyou can't vote for.
909,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,Everybody else is on the block.It's time to vote.
910,00:39:25.33,00:39:25.33,"Christy, you're up."
911,00:39:46.10,00:39:46.10,He crossed me once.
912,00:39:47.90,00:39:47.90,I forgave him.
913,00:39:49.57,00:39:49.57,He crossed me twice.
914,00:39:51.30,00:39:51.30, I offered reconciliation.
915,00:39:54.00,00:39:54.00,His reign is over.
916,00:40:08.43,00:40:08.43,"You're way too muchof a threat,"
917,00:40:09.97,00:40:09.97,"and, uh, it's timefor you to go."
918,00:40:11.73,00:40:11.73," Take it easy, buddy."
919,00:40:38.23,00:40:38.23,I'll go tally the votes.
920,00:40:49.27,00:40:49.27,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
921,00:40:51.73,00:40:51.73,Person voted out will be asked
922,00:40:53.07,00:40:53.07,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
923,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,I'll read the votes.

944,00:42:19.67,00:42:19.67,I'd say that tonight's vote
945,00:42:21.27,00:42:21.27,was certainly a surpriseto at least a few of you.
946,00:42:23.03,00:42:23.03,I guess there is a lotof talking
947,00:42:24.53,00:42:24.53,"to be done, once you getback to camp."
