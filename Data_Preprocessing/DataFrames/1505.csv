1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously
2,00:00:02.33,00:00:02.33,on Survivor... >> Getting past last night's
3,00:00:04.96,00:00:04.96,vote was big. >> JEFF: Jean-Robert narrowly
4,00:00:07.12,00:00:07.12,escaped the vote. >> But at he next tribal council
5,00:00:09.46,00:00:09.46,"I'm not that worried, because Courtney is always the weak link"
6,00:00:12.04,00:00:12.04,"in every challenge, and if she survives the next tribal council"
7,00:00:15.25,00:00:15.25,she's got to be the luckiest girl in Survivor history.
8,00:00:22.12,00:00:22.12,>> I would prefer if Jean-Robert goes next because he's just so
9,00:00:24.62,00:00:24.62,"unpleasant. He's, like, a cocky son of a"
10,00:00:27.08,00:00:27.08,bitch. And he sucks so bad.
11,00:00:29.12,00:00:29.12,There's no getting out of that. >> JEFF: At Zhan Hu...
12,00:00:31.50,00:00:31.50,">> I don't know, man, find something, think of something."
13,00:00:34.08,00:00:34.08,>> JEFF: ...Dave continued to rub people the wrong way.
14,00:00:38.21,00:00:38.21,>> Thanks for listening. >> The same way you do with
15,00:00:40.79,00:00:40.79,"everybody else. You just listen, listen, listen,"
16,00:00:42.75,00:00:42.75,right? >> Dave's put himself in a weird
17,00:00:46.08,00:00:46.08,"position with everybody. I mean, he does help around"
18,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,"camp, but he's also pissing people off."
19,00:00:50.46,00:00:50.46,>> JEFF: And Sherea conserved her energy around camp for the
20,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,challenges. >> I'm getting frustrated
21,00:00:55.54,00:00:55.54,because Sherea is trying to get away with not helping out.
22,00:00:58.04,00:00:58.04,">> I'm going ride the workhorse until the tails fall off,"
23,00:01:01.29,00:01:01.29,because I'm not doing anything until I have to.
24,00:01:04.17,00:01:04.17,>> JEFF: At the immunity challenge...
25,00:01:07.25,00:01:07.25,Sherea launches again and scores!
26,00:01:11.92,00:01:11.92,Sherea rose to the occasion. But James once again dominated.
27,00:01:19.25,00:01:19.25,James connects again! Leading Fei Long to victory.
28,00:01:22.54,00:01:22.54,"Nobody going home from Fei Long. Back at the Zhan Hu camp, both"
29,00:01:27.38,00:01:27.38,Dave and Sherea were clearly in trouble.
30,00:01:30.17,00:01:30.17,">> I think if it were to me, you know, if we could get rid of"
31,00:01:32.62,00:01:32.62,"both of them, it would be great. >> JEFF: But at tribal council,"
32,00:01:37.62,00:01:37.62,Sherea convinced the tribe of her value.
33,00:01:42.17,00:01:42.17,">> If we don't save our energy for challenges, we'll never get"
34,00:01:44.92,00:01:44.92,further ahead in the game. >> JEFF: And Dave paid the price
35,00:01:47.58,00:01:47.58,for his abrasive personality. Fourth person voted out
36,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,"of Survivor: China, Dave. 12 are left."
37,00:01:53.92,00:01:53.92,Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by

39,00:02:15.29,00:02:15.29,">> Oh, we slept in. >> With Dave out of the picture,"
40,00:02:24.08,00:02:24.08,"everybody's just kind of peaceful, just chilling."
41,00:02:26.17,00:02:26.17,"You know, we sleep late and then we have a lot of"
42,00:02:28.25,00:02:28.25,relaxation time. >> You okay?
43,00:02:32.00,00:02:32.00,">> Losing is so boring, because we've already done it so much."
44,00:02:34.29,00:02:34.29,I want to do something different.
45,00:02:37.21,00:02:37.21,We should have a really strong team now.
46,00:02:39.62,00:02:39.62,"But the problem is Fei Long, they also have a very strong"
47,00:02:41.75,00:02:41.75,team. They're well led by Aaron.
48,00:02:44.04,00:02:44.04,"They've got the strongest player, James, and some very"
49,00:02:47.54,00:02:47.54,intelligent people. So they're a hard team to beat.
50,00:02:50.46,00:02:50.46,">> I think as long as, like, we, all, like, work together, like,"
51,00:02:52.88,00:02:52.88,"equally in every aspect, that way we're all strong here."
52,00:02:57.54,00:02:57.54,We're all strong at challenges. It sounds like that's what that
53,00:03:00.25,00:03:00.25,"other tribe is doing. I mean, it helps that they have"
54,00:03:03.79,00:03:03.79,"James, but... >> I definitely feel like the"
55,00:03:06.12,00:03:06.12,outsider in the tribe just because the four of them kind of
56,00:03:08.71,00:03:08.71,clique up sometimes. So I want to spice things up.
57,00:03:11.42,00:03:11.42,I want some drama or something going on.
58,00:03:13.54,00:03:13.54,I'm really looking for forward to something changing.
59,00:04:28.29,00:04:28.29,>> I wouldn't mind going by Taylor.
60,00:04:30.17,00:04:30.17,>> That's a cool name. >> I like Taylor.
61,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,>> I have a friend named Taylor. >> Really?
62,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,>> Uh-huh. >> Jaime and are kind of in the
63,00:04:38.12,00:04:38.12,"Garden of Eden setting, minus all the fruit."
64,00:04:40.38,00:04:40.38,It's biblical in the sense that there's man and woman and we
65,00:04:43.04,00:04:43.04,like hanging out. What's yours?
66,00:04:45.92,00:04:45.92,>> Nicole. >> Jaime Nicole Dugan.
67,00:04:48.46,00:04:48.46,">> Mm-hmm. >> That's a nice little sweet,"
68,00:04:50.54,00:04:50.54,Southern name. >> Yep.
69,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,"Erik and I have known each other, like... I guess it's 13"
70,00:04:55.08,00:04:55.08,days now. I don't know what's wrong with
71,00:04:57.00,00:04:57.00,him. I can't find anything wrong with
72,00:04:58.67,00:04:58.67,him so far. He's really attractive.
73,00:05:00.42,00:05:00.42,">> I like you a lot, so... >> All right."
74,00:05:05.46,00:05:05.46,">> I just want to get my thoughts out, just to know that"
75,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,I've said it. I don't know.
76,00:05:10.12,00:05:10.12,I just... I'm a virgin. >> Really?
77,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,">> Yeah. A few years ago I was like, ""I'm"
78,00:05:17.62,00:05:17.62,"not ready."" And I said it was because I was"
79,00:05:20.46,00:05:20.46,"too young, but it was really because I think I wasn't finding"
80,00:05:23.38,00:05:23.38,the right person. >> I think it's great that Erik
81,00:05:26.71,00:05:26.71,"is still a virgin, you know. I think it does prove that he's"
82,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,even more trustworthy than I even thought before.
83,00:05:35.92,00:05:35.92,So I'm trying to make it with him all the way through.
84,00:05:48.96,00:05:48.96,>> Yeah. The new word on the street is
85,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,"that there's an immunity idol, and Jaime wants to entrust me"
86,00:05:54.96,00:05:54.96,with the information. That's going to hopefully help
87,00:05:57.12,00:05:57.12,in the game. I don't know what's going to
88,00:05:59.50,00:05:59.50,"happen with Jaime and I's relationship, but she seems like"
89,00:06:03.00,00:06:03.00,a good all-around person to be aligned with right now at this
90,00:06:05.29,00:06:05.29,stage of the game. >> It's going to be another hot
91,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,"one, guys. >> Another glorious morning here"
92,00:06:22.08,00:06:22.08,in China. >> I am carrying most of the
93,00:06:29.83,00:06:29.83,"tribe's weight as far as work and the challenges, but Denise"
94,00:06:33.21,00:06:33.21,really does bust her ass out here.
95,00:06:35.83,00:06:35.83,She's the other one that really pulls the rope around here.
96,00:06:38.21,00:06:38.21,"I mean, you can't beat that. I like women like her."
97,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,"She's a strong, good woman. She's there to complement you"
98,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,and work with you. That's attractive.
99,00:06:46.54,00:06:46.54,I like that. If Denise was ten years younger
100,00:06:49.58,00:06:49.58,"or if I was older, whichever way, Denise would be in trouble."
101,00:06:53.58,00:06:53.58,"Yeah. Damn, that's enough to eat."
102,00:06:55.92,00:06:55.92,>> We should have brought a bucket and filled it up with
103,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,some water. Right now the person I trust
104,00:06:59.58,00:06:59.58,most is James. Him and I get along very well.
105,00:07:02.38,00:07:02.38,>> You think this rice will work?
106,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,They like rice. >> He picked up on my work
107,00:07:06.29,00:07:06.29,ethic. I've picked up on his.
108,00:07:08.58,00:07:08.58,Him and I seem to have a little connection going.
109,00:07:15.08,00:07:15.08,>> I can trust him and know I can stick with him and ride his
110,00:07:17.38,00:07:17.38,"coattail as Long as I can. >> James, how is our breakfast"
111,00:07:22.21,00:07:22.21,"coming along, boss? You're the cook."
112,00:07:24.88,00:07:24.88,"You cook, and we eat. >> Someone's coming in."
113,00:07:32.79,00:07:32.79,">> Oh, no, you guys. Something's going on."
114,00:07:36.92,00:07:36.92,>> Ni hao. >> Thank you.
115,00:07:41.12,00:07:41.12,">> Hello, hi. >> Is that for us?"
116,00:07:43.12,00:07:43.12,">> Hi, thank you. >> Hello."
117,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,">> Hi. We have a message, guys."
118,00:07:46.96,00:07:46.96,"Should we read it? Uh-oh, hold on, hold on."
119,00:07:53.17,00:07:53.17,"Okay. ""Fei Long, choose the two"
120,00:07:55.54,00:07:55.54,warriors from Zhan Hu who you feel could best help strengthen
121,00:07:58.12,00:07:58.12,"your tribe, win challenges and avoid tribal council."
122,00:08:01.00,00:08:01.00,Circle their names below. This fisherman will get your new
123,00:08:04.38,00:08:04.38,"tribe members and bring them back to your camp."""
124,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,">> Oh, my god. >> Well, what's the catch?"
125,00:08:10.29,00:08:10.29,">> Well, the catch will probably be that they get to pick two of"
126,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,"ours, and they're going to pick, obviously, like, you and James,"
127,00:08:15.08,00:08:15.08,"Aaron. >> But, I mean, it's not about"
128,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,strength all the time. >> It pretty much is about
129,00:08:19.25,00:08:19.25,strength. >> I think someone's going to
130,00:08:22.00,00:08:22.00,get switched for sure on our tribe.
131,00:08:24.08,00:08:24.08,I think that they're probably going to have a note quite
132,00:08:26.08,00:08:26.08,"similar that says, you know, ""Circle two people from the"
133,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,"other tribe that you think will benefit yours, and they are now"
134,00:08:29.62,00:08:29.62,"part of your tribe."" I don't know."
135,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,But the situation at camp right now is we have to pick two
136,00:08:34.12,00:08:34.12,members from the other tribe. >> Okay.
137,00:08:36.58,00:08:36.58,Do you want to have just have everyone have just who their
138,00:08:38.62,00:08:38.62,number one pick would be? >> Frosti.
139,00:08:40.58,00:08:40.58,>> Frosti. >> Frosti.
140,00:08:42.17,00:08:42.17,">> I'd say Frosti. >> Okay, Frosti is the number"
141,00:08:44.21,00:08:44.21,one pick. >> Do you think it's Frosti and
142,00:08:46.00,00:08:46.00,Sherea? >> I think that's a smart move.
143,00:08:48.12,00:08:48.12,">> All right, do it up. >> Okay, fine."
144,00:08:50.62,00:08:50.62,>> Frosti and Sherea. >> All right.
145,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,>> We think that Frosti and Sherea will benefit our camp
146,00:08:55.71,00:08:55.71,"because they're both tough, they're both strong and fast,"
147,00:08:57.75,00:08:57.75,"and, you know, they seem like good people."
148,00:09:00.38,00:09:00.38,But it's kind of crazy. It's almost like everything
149,00:09:02.58,00:09:02.58,you've devised has to be put on pause for a few minutes while
150,00:09:04.71,00:09:04.71,"you figure new things out. >> James, if they get the same"
151,00:09:11.46,00:09:11.46,"note, they are 100% picking you. >> ""Zhan Hu, choose the two"
152,00:09:22.25,00:09:22.25,warriors from Fei Long who you think can best help to
153,00:09:25.21,00:09:25.21,strengthen your tribe. Circle their names below.
154,00:09:27.92,00:09:27.92,This fisherman will go get your new tribe members and bring them
155,00:09:30.38,00:09:30.38,"back to your camp."" >> So we're getting two"
156,00:09:32.58,00:09:32.58,"people. That means we'll have, what,"
157,00:09:35.00,00:09:35.00,seven? >> We'll have seven.
158,00:09:36.46,00:09:36.46,That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
159,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,">> That is messed up. >> Oh, my god, they're going to"
160,00:09:40.29,00:09:40.29,be so pissed. >> Yeah.
161,00:09:43.17,00:09:43.17,">> Oh, my god, now Zhan Hu is going to have seven and Fei Long"
162,00:09:46.33,00:09:46.33,"is going to have five. I mean, it's crazy."
163,00:09:48.96,00:09:48.96,It's going to really cripple the other tribe.
164,00:09:51.62,00:09:51.62,"I mean, it's huge. Power really shifted to our"
165,00:09:54.21,00:09:54.21,tribe today with that crazy twist.
166,00:09:56.58,00:09:56.58,>> James. I call James.
167,00:09:58.29,00:09:58.29,>> James is number one. We all call James?
168,00:10:00.25,00:10:00.25,>> James. >> Please.
169,00:10:01.92,00:10:01.92,>> So none of the women. We don't want any of the women.
170,00:10:03.75,00:10:03.75,>> I think we should get Aaron and vote him off.
171,00:10:06.62,00:10:06.62,"That would be kind of dirty, but..."
172,00:10:08.42,00:10:08.42,">> Yeah, if we got Aaron then we would be able to vote him out."
173,00:10:10.12,00:10:10.12,>> We could just vote him off. If we lose he would be the first
174,00:10:11.92,00:10:11.92,one to go and we don't have to worry about us.
175,00:10:13.58,00:10:13.58,>> I'm ready to do it. Let's do it.
176,00:10:15.04,00:10:15.04,>> Aaron? >> Go.
177,00:10:16.92,00:10:16.92,>> James and Aaron. Let's flip it around.
178,00:10:18.54,00:10:18.54,">> Come on, guys. Zhan Hu!"
179,00:10:20.25,00:10:20.25,>> Zhan Hu and Fei Long just flipped.
180,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,We're now seven-five instead of five-seven.
181,00:10:25.08,00:10:25.08,And we have a huge advantage. We have all the strongest
182,00:10:26.88,00:10:26.88,players. So it's looking really good for
183,00:10:29.62,00:10:29.62,"us. >> All right, come on, guys."
184,00:10:31.67,00:10:31.67,Zhan Hu! >> Here they come.
185,00:10:40.25,00:10:40.25,>> Is it them? Should we go down and welcome
186,00:10:42.21,00:10:42.21,them? >> Yes.
187,00:10:44.08,00:10:44.08,>> Are they waving? >> No.
188,00:10:45.71,00:10:45.71,">> I'm waving, though. >> They're pissed."
189,00:10:47.38,00:10:47.38,They're totally pissed that we picked them.
190,00:10:49.71,00:10:49.71,">> Is that them standing? >> No, I don't see anybody"
191,00:10:51.42,00:10:51.42,standing. They're probably sitting down.
192,00:10:53.25,00:10:53.25,>> This is so weird. >> What?
193,00:10:57.79,00:10:57.79,>> Oh! >> Oh!
194,00:11:07.08,00:11:07.08,>> Apparently that wasn't the end of the twist.
195,00:11:09.58,00:11:09.58,"Seems Fei Long picked two people from Zhan Hu, and those people"
196,00:11:13.50,00:11:13.50,"were Sherea and myself. >> Oh, my god."
197,00:11:15.88,00:11:15.88,>> I don't even know what to say.
198,00:11:17.50,00:11:17.50,">> I don't, either. >> What are we going to do?"
199,00:11:19.54,00:11:19.54,>> It never crossed my mind that they were going to take two of
200,00:11:21.04,00:11:21.04,"us. We were just like, ""Oh, we get"
201,00:11:22.92,00:11:22.92,"to have two strong people."" We didn't think about it at all."
202,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,"That was really dumb. >> Whatever we're going to do,"
203,00:11:27.92,00:11:27.92,"we're just going to do our best to stay in it, you know."
204,00:11:29.79,00:11:29.79,"No matter what happens, you guys have control of the two biggest"
205,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,"players in the game, so remember that."
206,00:11:34.21,00:11:34.21,>> So use it to your advantage. >> I'll miss you.
207,00:11:36.08,00:11:36.08,">> I'll miss you, too. >> See you soon."
208,00:11:46.12,00:11:46.12,">> Bye, guys. New adventure."
209,00:11:48.62,00:11:48.62,">> Yep. >> Good luck, guys."
210,00:12:12.67,00:12:12.67,">> Yeah. >> These are different drivers,"
211,00:12:14.50,00:12:14.50,you guys. They're here to get two of us.
212,00:12:16.33,00:12:16.33,>> Yep. >> Ni hau.
213,00:12:18.25,00:12:18.25,">> Ni hau. >> Okay, here we go."
214,00:12:23.75,00:12:23.75,">> Thank you. It says, ""Fei Long, if it is"
215,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,"your name that is circled, pack your personal belongings and go"
216,00:12:30.71,00:12:30.71,"with this fisherman to join your new tribe at Zhan Hu."""
217,00:12:33.42,00:12:33.42,"Aaron, James. >> They have a pretty sweet team"
218,00:12:37.12,00:12:37.12,now. >> What are we going to do
219,00:12:47.17,00:12:47.17,without you people? >> What are we going to do
220,00:12:49.17,00:12:49.17,"without you? >> We've got a great camp, we've"
221,00:12:51.08,00:12:51.08,"got such great momentum, and we've been such a great force on"
222,00:12:53.71,00:12:53.71,"this team, and now we're switching and everything is"
223,00:12:56.04,00:12:56.04,"messed up. >> I can't stand it, losing our"
224,00:12:58.33,00:12:58.33,two strongest warriors. >> I thought you were our
225,00:13:00.46,00:13:00.46,"strongest warrior, big boy. >> Yeah, you're Jean-Robert."
226,00:13:02.58,00:13:02.58,"Yeah. >> Bye, Amanda."
227,00:13:05.71,00:13:05.71,">> Bye. >> Bye, Todd."
228,00:13:07.96,00:13:07.96,>> Take care. Be good.
229,00:13:11.62,00:13:11.62,">> Man, I just fixed my part of the bed."
230,00:13:14.25,00:13:14.25,"I don't have any ties, anything with Aaron."
231,00:13:17.96,00:13:17.96,"Going over to Zhan Hu, I'm pretty much by myself now."
232,00:13:20.29,00:13:20.29,I'm starting all over again. I'm going to have to work my way
233,00:13:22.96,00:13:22.96,into the system again. >> We're giving up our two
234,00:13:28.67,00:13:28.67,"strongest warriors, Aaron and James."
235,00:13:32.62,00:13:32.62,"If that's not bad enough, James is one of my strongest allies in"
236,00:13:36.04,00:13:36.04,"this whole game. >> Bye, guys."
237,00:13:40.08,00:13:40.08,>> Bye-bye. >> I was a little upset.
238,00:13:45.38,00:13:45.38,"I mean, I've been getting along with James."
239,00:13:47.54,00:13:47.54,"James works around here. But, you know, I mean, things"
240,00:13:49.79,00:13:49.79,"change. Things change for the good,"
241,00:13:51.58,00:13:51.58,things change for the bad. >> That means that Jean-Robert
242,00:13:53.88,00:13:53.88,is going to have to actually move his ass and get water.
243,00:13:57.88,00:13:57.88,">> We should probably talk about, before those guys get"
244,00:14:00.38,00:14:00.38,"here, what our plan is going to be."
245,00:14:02.38,00:14:02.38,>> I say we don't even think about it until we lose.
246,00:14:04.38,00:14:04.38,">> I agree. >> No, I say we have to think"
247,00:14:06.62,00:14:06.62,"about it, because it's not something we can talk about when"
248,00:14:08.29,00:14:08.29,"they're here. If it came down to it, at first"
249,00:14:10.96,00:14:10.96,tribal council we go for Sherea and then we go for Frosti.
250,00:14:15.75,00:14:15.75,>> Totally. >> Sounds good to me.
251,00:14:17.62,00:14:17.62,">> The popular thing would be, ""Well, you know, Jean-Robert,"
252,00:14:19.88,00:14:19.88,"yeah, yeah, yeah..."" >> Why do you say that's the"
253,00:14:22.58,00:14:22.58,"popular thing, Jean-Robert? >> I'm just saying that..."
254,00:14:25.00,00:14:25.00,">> No, really, Sherea is.. >> I know that you guys are"
255,00:14:27.17,00:14:27.17,smart players and everything. I'm just saying that...
256,00:14:31.04,00:14:31.04,">> Right now we get rid of them. >> Right now, I think that's the"
257,00:14:33.75,00:14:33.75,"important thing. >> Todd and Courtney and Amanda,"
258,00:14:37.42,00:14:37.42,"who knows? They may just decide, ""Let's get"
259,00:14:39.92,00:14:39.92,"rid of Jean-Robert."" Today is a terrible day for Fei"
260,00:14:42.04,00:14:42.04,"Long, and today is a god-awful day for Jean-Robert."
261,00:15:11.88,00:15:11.88,>> James and I are going to Zhan Hu.
262,00:15:14.12,00:15:14.12,We just switched tribes. And I'm ready.
263,00:15:17.21,00:15:17.21,">> We're going to have to make this work, dude."
264,00:15:19.33,00:15:19.33,">> We're going to be fine, dude. >> I'm chillin'."
265,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67,>> We're cool. We're going in with only two
266,00:15:23.62,00:15:23.62,"people, you know, and they have three."
267,00:15:26.04,00:15:26.04,"So it is a cause for, like, some apprehension on my part."
268,00:15:29.79,00:15:29.79,Where is their hut? >> Here they are.
269,00:15:33.88,00:15:33.88,Ahoy. >> Good to have you guys.
270,00:15:37.21,00:15:37.21,>> Who knew? >> Good to see you.
271,00:15:39.88,00:15:39.88,"Welcome. >> What are you guys, swimming?"
272,00:15:42.62,00:15:42.62,>> Give me a hug. >> Hi.
273,00:15:45.83,00:15:45.83,>> No way! >> Yes!
274,00:15:49.12,00:15:49.12,>> My god! >> We have alcohol!
275,00:15:52.79,00:15:52.79,">> When Aaron and James came over, they brought a little"
276,00:15:55.12,00:15:55.12,bounty with them. It was a big basket full of
277,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,different fruits and nuts. >> Did y'all think it was going
278,00:16:02.96,00:16:02.96,to be you two? >> We knew it was going to be
279,00:16:05.08,00:16:05.08,James. ( laughter )
280,00:16:07.62,00:16:07.62,We didn't know who else it would be.
281,00:16:09.46,00:16:09.46,>> Zhan Hu is going to be a little bit harder.
282,00:16:11.54,00:16:11.54,All my people are over there on Fei Long.
283,00:16:13.42,00:16:13.42,These people are all happy. Everything is relaxed.
284,00:16:16.50,00:16:16.50,My people are miserable over there.
285,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,I like misery. >> Y'all are now yellow.
286,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,>> It's crazy seeing you guys yellow.
287,00:16:21.75,00:16:21.75,">> It's weird, like, y'all are on our side now."
288,00:16:23.38,00:16:23.38,>> Who is the brain out of the group?
289,00:16:25.46,00:16:25.46,">> Actually, we all are. We're all, I mean..."
290,00:16:30.21,00:16:30.21,">> We are in different ways, sort of."
291,00:16:32.08,00:16:32.08,>> Me and her do puzzles for fun and stuff like that back home.
292,00:16:34.88,00:16:34.88,>> I can do puzzles. >> Strategy.
293,00:16:36.96,00:16:36.96,">> As far as us three are concerned, we all are kind of"
294,00:16:38.54,00:16:38.54,balanced. >> Tomorrow y'all really need to
295,00:16:40.75,00:16:40.75,"pull this off. I'll make water, I'll get"
296,00:16:43.79,00:16:43.79,"everything done, because I'm used to doing that anyway."
297,00:16:46.12,00:16:46.12,Y'all focus on what y'all need to do tomorrow to gets things
298,00:16:49.17,00:16:49.17,"ready, get yourself focused to win."
299,00:16:51.50,00:16:51.50,>> Of course James and Aaron know they're on the chopping
300,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,"block, so they're definitely trying to fire us up for winning"
301,00:16:56.33,00:16:56.33,the challenges. >> Make a toast to the new Zhan
302,00:17:00.00,00:17:00.00,Hu. May we prevail.
303,00:17:02.04,00:17:02.04,We have control over the two strongest guys right now in the
304,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,"game. I mean, it's a major advantage."
305,00:17:07.25,00:17:07.25,It's just what we choose to do with it.
306,00:17:10.54,00:17:10.54,>> Thank you for welcoming us. >> Here they come.
307,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,>> We've got to stick together now.
308,00:17:19.29,00:17:19.29,">> All right. >> Hey, guys."
309,00:17:22.29,00:17:22.29,">> Hey, guys. >> Hello!"
310,00:17:24.08,00:17:24.08,>> Hello. >> Hello.
311,00:17:25.71,00:17:25.71,>> Welcome! >> Welcome to Fei Long.
312,00:17:27.71,00:17:27.71,>> You guys are Skinny Minnie. >> The fact that Frosti and
313,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00,"Sherea are coming over to our side is kind of exciting,"
314,00:17:33.54,00:17:33.54,because I may be able to get great bonds with them.
315,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,So who knows what I can build there?
316,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83,>> It's a basket of food! ( cheering )
317,00:17:40.62,00:17:40.62,">> Let's celebrate, guys! >> Coming over to Fei Long, I"
318,00:17:48.08,00:17:48.08,"feel like I'm starting over, you know, in the game all over"
319,00:17:49.83,00:17:49.83,again. So I'm going to do my best to
320,00:17:51.50,00:17:51.50,try to get to know them and try to find my place and fit in.
321,00:17:53.29,00:17:53.29,>> Pop open one of those bottles.
322,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,">> Welcome, tribe members. >> Welcome, you guys."
323,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,>> My position at Zhan Hu was not secure in the fact that I
324,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,wasn't the hardest worker at camp.
325,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,So I'm hoping over here that they kind of see me in a
326,00:18:06.58,00:18:06.58,"different light, and maybe I can, you know, step it up some."
327,00:18:11.71,00:18:11.71,>> We don't have any cooks. >> I can cook a little
328,00:18:13.38,00:18:13.38,something-something. >> I'll try and bring back clean
329,00:18:15.08,00:18:15.08,"fish, and you can cook something."
330,00:18:17.08,00:18:17.08,>> I can't believe I'm here. This place is so different.
331,00:18:19.25,00:18:19.25,>> Really? >> This is a dangerous place for
332,00:18:21.33,00:18:21.33,me. Things are really messed up now.
333,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,>> I really wanted to see you guys' camp.
334,00:18:25.62,00:18:25.62,I just didn't know it was going to be permanent.
335,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,"I'm out of my comfort zone, obviously, because I'm"
336,00:18:29.62,00:18:29.62,outnumbered by old Fei Long members with Sherea.
337,00:18:31.96,00:18:31.96,"My first goal is to figure out what's going on around here,"
338,00:18:35.21,00:18:35.21,"what kind of alliances I can sense, just see where I can put"
339,00:18:37.67,00:18:37.67,myself that's going to keep me around.
340,00:18:57.33,00:18:57.33,>> Get a little rice going here. This morning I just felt like
341,00:19:00.96,00:19:00.96,giving us a little bit of a head start because we lost our sous
342,00:19:04.17,00:19:04.17,"chef, Aaron and James. So I decided to come out here"
343,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,"and just try to build a fire. And since I got the fire going,"
344,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,I might as well start getting the rice going.
345,00:19:20.50,00:19:20.50,>> I know. Who is going to have to argue
346,00:19:22.58,00:19:22.58,"with him now, though? I don't want to argue with him"
347,00:19:24.38,00:19:24.38,anymore. >> Waking up to everybody
348,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,bashing Jean-Robert was better than the food that we got the
349,00:19:34.46,00:19:34.46,"night before. To me, that just makes me so"
350,00:19:37.38,00:19:37.38,much more comfortable knowing that there's somebody here they
351,00:19:40.33,00:19:40.33,already have problems with. So it's looking like Jean-Robert
352,00:19:43.04,00:19:43.04,is in a bit of a pinch. >> I'm going to go check the
353,00:19:47.17,00:19:47.17,traps for shrimp. I started the rice.
354,00:19:49.46,00:19:49.46,"I mean, the rice is basically done."
355,00:19:52.08,00:19:52.08,">> Jean-Robert woke up early this morning, which he never"
356,00:19:54.71,00:19:54.71,"does, and he started cooking breakfast for everybody."
357,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,He's trying to save his butt right now.
358,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,">> Denise, if you want, maybe we can set out that second net."
359,00:20:06.38,00:20:06.38,>> What's that? >> I'm not the tribe leader.
360,00:20:09.50,00:20:09.50,I don't want to be tribe leader. I'm just saying what I want to
361,00:20:11.54,00:20:11.54,do. >> Huh?
362,00:20:13.38,00:20:13.38,I'm not handing out any orders. >> Okay.
363,00:20:19.75,00:20:19.75,>> I just asked for help with the setting out of the net.
364,00:20:28.17,00:20:28.17,>> Thank you. Sherea can cook.
365,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,That's going to be real helpful for us.
366,00:20:32.42,00:20:32.42,"Maybe you can make some sort of, like, sardine fried rice for"
367,00:20:34.62,00:20:34.62,"Todd to start out with, and I'll bring back shrimp, and then you"
368,00:20:37.54,00:20:37.54,can make shrimp fried rice. That would be great.
369,00:20:40.08,00:20:40.08,">> Morning. >> Morning, everybody."
370,00:20:43.79,00:20:43.79,Welcome to Fei Long. I love it.
371,00:20:55.67,00:20:55.67,"I love it. >> Seems like right now, Jean-"
372,00:21:04.58,00:21:04.58,Robert is the one that gets on everybody's nerves.
373,00:21:07.12,00:21:07.12,I definitely believe this could be the opening for me with the
374,00:21:09.12,00:21:09.12,way they kind of don't get along with Jean-Robert as great for
375,00:21:11.12,00:21:11.12,everybody. I'm definitely going to try to
376,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,make my way in there. >> That looked really cool when
377,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,"you guys pulled up, all, like, chilling on top of that boat."
378,00:21:31.58,00:21:31.58,">> Yeah. Yeah, it was beautiful."
379,00:21:33.75,00:21:33.75,We've got a super tribe right here.
380,00:21:35.71,00:21:35.71,">> Yeah, we do. >> I mean, there isn't any"
381,00:21:37.67,00:21:37.67,reason why we shouldn't win again and again and again.
382,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,>> Yeah. >> This is Zhan Hu.
383,00:21:42.83,00:21:42.83,"This is my new tribe. Erik and Peih-Gee and Jaime,"
384,00:21:46.46,00:21:46.46,"they're really awesome people, you know?"
385,00:21:50.04,00:21:50.04,And they're really solid. >> This is so much fun.
386,00:21:52.29,00:21:52.29,>> Uh-huh. >> I couldn't imagine a better
387,00:21:54.54,00:21:54.54,way to spend the summer. I feel comfortable here.
388,00:21:57.33,00:21:57.33,"I don't know how James feels, but we'll see."
389,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,">> James is amazingly... >> He's, like, the powerhouse."
390,00:22:03.29,00:22:03.29,Yeah. That's why... he's pretty much
391,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,the catalyst and why we're winning these challenges.
392,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,"You know, the only thing is that, yes, James is good here."
393,00:22:11.33,00:22:11.33,"When we go to the merge, bad. Yeah."
394,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,Everyone has to consider how great of an athlete that James
395,00:22:17.71,00:22:17.71,"is. You know, and when there is a"
396,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,"merge that comes, you know, how dangerous he could be if he's"
397,00:22:23.21,00:22:23.21,a... what they call an immunity hog.
398,00:22:26.29,00:22:26.29,All of us are pretty much equal. James is physically a little bit
399,00:22:29.00,00:22:29.00,more than us. That is strategy talk.
400,00:22:32.29,00:22:32.29,"That was a subtle card I played, you know, just to save my butt"
401,00:22:34.67,00:22:34.67,just in case we do lose an immunity.
402,00:22:38.21,00:22:38.21,">> Aaron, okay, say we merge and Jean-Robert is still left, would"
403,00:22:41.21,00:22:41.21,he be the first person once we merged that you'd vote off?
404,00:22:49.54,00:22:49.54,>> Let me think about that. >> Aaron's smart.
405,00:22:53.21,00:22:53.21,"He's athletic, he's good- looking, which always helps"
406,00:22:55.29,00:22:55.29,"people like you a little more. >> I don't know, you know?"
407,00:22:59.08,00:22:59.08,>> But I think Aaron is a little bit crafty.
408,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,He's probably holding a little bit back.
409,00:23:04.96,00:23:04.96,"Now that we have Aaron and James over here, Frosti and Sherea are"
410,00:23:07.92,00:23:07.92,over at the other camp. I don't know how long members of
411,00:23:11.88,00:23:11.88,my original alliance are going to last over there.
412,00:23:15.04,00:23:15.04,So definitely I'm going to try to pull Jaime aside and have a
413,00:23:17.08,00:23:17.08,"talk with her, see what she thinks of everything."
414,00:24:12.29,00:24:12.29,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys. How did you feel, Todd, when"
415,00:24:22.58,00:24:22.58,"Frosti and Sherea showed up? >> You know, Frosti and Sherea"
416,00:24:25.75,00:24:25.75,"are great, so I thought they were a good asset to our tribe."
417,00:24:28.25,00:24:28.25,"I mean, we did lose two strong, awesome people, but we also"
418,00:24:31.29,00:24:31.29,gained two people that I'm sure are going to fight hard.
419,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,">> JEFF: Aaron, is this a good move for you?"
420,00:24:36.58,00:24:36.58,>> It puts us on the chopping block as new members.
421,00:24:39.12,00:24:39.12,We really have to put up or shut up right here in this challenge
422,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"and make it happen, and win. If you win, you don't go home."
423,00:24:45.12,00:24:45.12,>> JEFF: Are you guys ready to get to your first challenge as
424,00:24:47.54,00:24:47.54,"new tribes? >> Yes, sir."
425,00:24:49.62,00:24:49.62,">> JEFF: First things first. Amanda, give it up."
426,00:24:52.83,00:24:52.83,">> Okay. >> JEFF: Once again, immunity is"
427,00:24:56.62,00:24:56.62,"back up for grabs. For today's challenge, two"
428,00:25:00.79,00:25:00.79,members of each tribe will swim out to a platform.
429,00:25:04.04,00:25:04.04,"You will then alternate diving into a water, where you'll find"
430,00:25:06.96,00:25:06.96,a cage filled with 12 disks representing the signs of the
431,00:25:10.25,00:25:10.25,Chinese zodiac. To release those disks you have
432,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,to remove as many bamboo poles as possible before resurfacing.
433,00:25:18.50,00:25:18.50,You'll then put all 12 disks in a boat and swim to shore.
434,00:25:22.08,00:25:22.08,The three remaining tribe members will then match each
435,00:25:24.83,00:25:24.83,disk to its corresponding spot on the board by twisting it and
436,00:25:30.04,00:25:30.04,turning it until they lock into place.
437,00:25:33.17,00:25:33.17,"First tribe to finish wins immunity, safe at least one more"
438,00:25:35.96,00:25:35.96,"night here in China. Losers, tribal council, somebody"
439,00:25:39.12,00:25:39.12,"will be voted out. Fei Long, you have two extra"
440,00:25:42.79,00:25:42.79,"members, sitting two people out. Who's it going to be?"
441,00:25:45.62,00:25:45.62,Amanda and Courtney. Take a spot on the bench.
442,00:25:48.83,00:25:48.83,"Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to figure out who your"
443,00:25:50.62,00:25:50.62,"swimmers are going to be, we'll get started."
444,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,"Erik and Aaron swimming for Zhan Hu, Frosti and Jean-Robert for"
445,00:26:03.67,00:26:03.67,"Fei Long. Here we go, for immunity."
446,00:26:06.21,00:26:06.21,Survivors ready? Go!
447,00:26:09.33,00:26:09.33,">> Swim, guys. Swim, swim, swim!"
448,00:26:20.96,00:26:20.96,>> JEFF: You need to get as many sticks out in one breath before
449,00:26:23.08,00:26:23.08,switching out. Go!
450,00:26:26.21,00:26:26.21,Jean-Robert is in for Fei Long. Aaron in for Zhan Hu.
451,00:26:35.08,00:26:35.08,Aaron is up. Jean-Robert is up.
452,00:26:37.29,00:26:37.29,Got to get back to the mat before the next guy can go.
453,00:26:41.17,00:26:41.17,Go! Go!
454,00:26:51.21,00:26:51.21,"The longer you stay under, the more sticks you can pull out."
455,00:26:54.92,00:26:54.92,">> Go, Jean-Robert! It broke a little bit of my"
456,00:26:57.67,00:26:57.67,heart to say that. >> JEFF: Both tribes pretty even
457,00:27:07.12,00:27:07.12,at this point. With each dive it's getting more
458,00:27:10.88,00:27:10.88,and more difficult. Deepest one's about 12 feet.
459,00:27:22.33,00:27:22.33,Erik really winded. Getting very hard for people to
460,00:27:25.54,00:27:25.54,"breathe. >> Boys, take your time and just"
461,00:27:28.58,00:27:28.58,get your breath first. Wait a minute.
462,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,Wait a long minute. ( laughs )
463,00:27:33.17,00:27:33.17,">> Focus, children. >> Focus on what?"
464,00:27:35.62,00:27:35.62,>> Something. Focus on thinking of the things
465,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,we have to... >> The puzzle?
466,00:27:39.29,00:27:39.29,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: Getting down to the
467,00:27:52.71,00:27:52.71,last few sticks. >> I got one.
468,00:28:15.21,00:28:15.21,>> JEFF: Zhan Hu thinks they have all 12.
469,00:28:18.42,00:28:18.42,Got to get them in the boat and drag it to shore.
470,00:28:21.08,00:28:21.08,Frosti down for a long time. >> Got them all.
471,00:28:25.08,00:28:25.08,"Come on, Jean-Robert! Grab the disks!"
472,00:28:28.17,00:28:28.17,>> JEFF: Got to have 12 disks. Make sure you do.
473,00:28:31.50,00:28:31.50,">> Put them all in the boat. Come on, Frosti!"
474,00:28:34.08,00:28:34.08,>> Come on! >> JEFF: Boat going in the
475,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,water. Aaron and Erik heading back.
476,00:28:39.25,00:28:39.25,">> Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
477,00:28:41.71,00:28:41.71,Come on. Swim it in!
478,00:28:43.25,00:28:43.25,"Swim it in! Come on, guys."
479,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,>> JEFF: Fei Long has all 12. Jean-Robert pulls the boat in
480,00:28:48.21,00:28:48.21,"the water, nearly loses the disks."
481,00:28:50.50,00:28:50.50,">> Nothing spilled out, right? >> No."
482,00:28:52.25,00:28:52.25,>> JEFF: It's a race back to shore.
483,00:28:54.54,00:28:54.54,">> Come on, y'all >> Aaron with the rope in his"
484,00:28:56.42,00:28:56.42,"teeth, man. >> JEFF: Zhan Hu back first."
485,00:29:04.04,00:29:04.04,Got to get it up on that mat. You're good!
486,00:29:07.33,00:29:07.33,Take over! Get those disks up on to your
487,00:29:10.92,00:29:10.92,mat before you can start on the puzzle.
488,00:29:15.38,00:29:15.38,Zhan Hu starts to work on the puzzle.
489,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,Jean-Robert completely exhausted.
490,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,">> Go, go, go! >> JEFF: Got to get all 12"
491,00:29:25.12,00:29:25.12,pieces before you can reveal the puzzle board.
492,00:29:29.25,00:29:29.25,"It is now a race between Todd, Sherea and Denise, James, Peih-"
493,00:29:32.29,00:29:32.29,Gee and Jaime. >> Got one.
494,00:29:37.25,00:29:37.25,">> Got one, guys. >> They fit."
495,00:29:41.25,00:29:41.25,>> JEFF: Fei Long making up a lot of time.
496,00:29:45.67,00:29:45.67,They're now in the lead. Jaime appears not to be
497,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,concerned at all. You'd never know there was
498,00:29:52.88,00:29:52.88,"anything on the line. Denise, Sherea, Todd working as"
499,00:29:55.62,00:29:55.62,hard as they can. >> Here we go.
500,00:29:58.58,00:29:58.58,>> JEFF: They've locked in five pieces.
501,00:30:00.62,00:30:00.62,"Zhan Hu still with one. >> They have to fit on, y'all."
502,00:30:03.38,00:30:03.38,They have to fit on like this. >> The red.
503,00:30:06.04,00:30:06.04,>> JEFF: Fei Long working very well together.
504,00:30:09.67,00:30:09.67,Nobody on this tribe wants to go home.
505,00:30:12.21,00:30:12.21,"Peih-Gee, you good at puzzles? >> I'm good at sudoko."
506,00:30:14.75,00:30:14.75,>> ( bleep ) sudoko. Pay attention.
507,00:30:17.17,00:30:17.17,>> JEFF: Fei Long getting very close to winning this challenge.
508,00:30:20.25,00:30:20.25,"Only two pieces left. >> Switch, switch, switch."
509,00:30:26.21,00:30:26.21,>> Get it on! Get it on!
510,00:30:29.67,00:30:29.67,">> JEFF: Fei Long wins immunity! >> Good job, guys."
511,00:30:33.92,00:30:33.92,"Good job. >> JEFF: Zhan Hu, your extra"
512,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,piece that really didn't come into play anyway.
513,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,">> JEFF: Fei Long, congratulations once again."
514,00:30:47.67,00:30:47.67,Immunity going home with you. >> Thanks.
515,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,">> JEFF: Zhan Hu, definitely the worst performance at a challenge"
516,00:30:53.25,00:30:53.25,yet. Had a big lead from Aaron and
517,00:30:55.38,00:30:55.38,"Erik, and Jaime, Peih-Gee, and James completely blew it."
518,00:30:59.17,00:30:59.17,Tribal council tonight. Somebody going home.
519,00:31:01.08,00:31:01.08,Grab your stuff. Head on back to camp.
520,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,>> Ah! >> You can't handle pressure.
521,00:31:22.71,00:31:22.71,"Like, I hollered at you. And the puzzle girl, the one we"
522,00:31:26.29,00:31:26.29,"relied on, the brains of the thing, she completely cracks and"
523,00:31:29.21,00:31:29.21,starts talking about soduko. And that's funny.
524,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,"And then everything is funny. >> It's not, like, a logical"
525,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,"kind of puzzle. I mean, that's why."
526,00:31:36.75,00:31:36.75,"I thought it, like, was a logical... you just had to sit"
527,00:31:38.88,00:31:38.88,"and, like, try them all out. >> Talking about soduko!"
528,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,">> Jeff asked me a question. What was I going to do, ignore"
529,00:31:45.92,00:31:45.92,him? >> Yes!
530,00:31:47.88,00:31:47.88,Yes! Was Jeff's question that
531,00:31:51.00,00:31:51.00,"important, or winning the challenge?"
532,00:31:53.71,00:31:53.71,Now somebody's ass got to go home.
533,00:31:56.38,00:31:56.38,"If you don't focus, I don't want to hear it."
534,00:31:59.46,00:31:59.46,Especially during the game. You're still not focusing?
535,00:32:03.08,00:32:03.08,"Oh, goodness, gracious! Y'all two guys need to figure"
536,00:32:06.62,00:32:06.62,"out which one of these girls is going home, because we need a"
537,00:32:09.29,00:32:09.29,strong team. Y'all can play high school if
538,00:32:11.88,00:32:11.88,y'all want. That's all I'm going to say.
539,00:32:14.71,00:32:14.71,I'm not babysitting a bunch of children who just don't want to
540,00:32:16.79,00:32:16.79,do nothing and be funny during a challenge.
541,00:32:19.00,00:32:19.00,"Them girls are about to go thirsty, because I just can't"
542,00:32:20.83,00:32:20.83,support people who ain't going to try.
543,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,"So they might as well send me home, you know, or cut one of"
544,00:32:25.29,00:32:25.29,"those girls. >> What's up, dude?"
545,00:32:44.12,00:32:44.12,>> Were they doing that in the other challenges?
546,00:32:46.62,00:32:46.62,"I mean, like, she's supposed to be good at puzzles, and..."
547,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,">> Oh, she completely dropped the ball."
548,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,>> They always put her in there. >> I think I just want go and
549,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,freakin' just try and get it out of them.
550,00:33:03.92,00:33:03.92,>> Go talk to them. >> Go talk to them.
551,00:33:05.58,00:33:05.58,>> They're right there. >> Hi.
552,00:33:08.62,00:33:08.62,>> Hi. >> What the hell was that?
553,00:33:14.38,00:33:14.38,">> Are they kicking one of us out, you think?"
554,00:33:17.42,00:33:17.42,">> We threw the challenge. >> I mean, I wouldn't have done"
555,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,"it... >> I mean, I was laughing during"
556,00:33:22.88,00:33:22.88,the whole thing. I threw one of our pieces to the
557,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,"other side. >> Wait a minute, what?"
558,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,>> Could you not tell we were throwing it?
559,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,">> The two girls, they basically threw it, you know, on purpose."
560,00:33:33.58,00:33:33.58,I didn't know that the girls were going to throw it.
561,00:33:36.38,00:33:36.38,That puts me in a really tough position.
562,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,"I'm forced to... in this situation, to stick with them."
563,00:33:42.00,00:33:42.00,"Unfortunately, I'm really having to trust them a lot, so I'm a"
564,00:33:45.54,00:33:45.54,"little worried about that. I mean, I trust you still, and I"
565,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,"really, really want to keep trusting you, you know?"
566,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> Yeah, definitely. >> Because I honestly want you"
567,00:33:55.92,00:33:55.92,and I to stick together... >> I think we should.
568,00:33:58.04,00:33:58.04,">> ...all the way to the finish, really."
569,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,">> Mm-hmm. >> I just don't like losing,"
570,00:34:02.71,00:34:02.71,"especially on purpose, but I want to remain in alliance with"
571,00:34:06.12,00:34:06.12,"Jaime, just because it's safe for now at least."
572,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,Do we definitely vote off James tonight?
573,00:34:16.92,00:34:16.92,">> Well, that's the thing. >> Would you rather..."
574,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,>> James is the one that was... >> Pissed.
575,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,>> Talking. I don't know why.
576,00:34:27.46,00:34:27.46,>> Okay. >> Aaron and James definitely
577,00:34:29.71,00:34:29.71,are on the chopping block. One of them's going home.
578,00:34:32.71,00:34:32.71,I just can't believe they didn't figure it out.
579,00:34:34.83,00:34:34.83,I mean... I trust James more than I do
580,00:34:36.92,00:34:36.92,Aaron for the simple fact that I think Aaron's made enough
581,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,alliances on the other side where he thinks he's set over
582,00:34:42.25,00:34:42.25,there. And I think James probably
583,00:34:44.12,00:34:44.12,didn't have quite as many ties at Fei Long.
584,00:34:46.71,00:34:46.71,So Aaron will be the first to get kicked off.
585,00:34:55.25,00:34:55.25,>> I don't know. I'm still shocked we lost so
586,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,bad. >> Aaron really deserves to
587,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,"stay. >> Yeah, send my ass home."
588,00:35:10.25,00:35:10.25,">> Well, originally we had agreed the first one to go was"
589,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,going to be Aaron from the get- go.
590,00:35:14.58,00:35:14.58,And we thought that we might be able to get James onto our side.
591,00:35:17.21,00:35:17.21,"I think after what happened today, he doesn't trust us at"
592,00:35:20.29,00:35:20.29,"all, which means that tonight at tribal council, we probably will"
593,00:35:24.00,00:35:24.00,have to get rid of James. >> Who are you guys voting?
594,00:35:33.46,00:35:33.46,">> The girls said James, man. So I feel like I have to go with"
595,00:35:36.21,00:35:36.21,what they say. >> Right.
596,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,"I don't trust, really, anyone here on Zhan Hu."
597,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"You know, I'm on the chopping block, and James is on the"
598,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,chopping block. But I think James is going to go
599,00:35:46.79,00:35:46.79,"home. So at tonight's tribal council,"
600,00:35:50.67,00:35:50.67,I am going to vote for James. Just so I won't have to vote for
601,00:35:56.71,00:35:56.71,"Peih-Gee or I won't have to vote for Jaime or anything like that,"
602,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,"so there's no hard feelings or any kind of vendettas, you know."
603,00:36:02.29,00:36:02.29,So we'll see what happens. >> JEFF: So let's talk about the
604,00:36:37.96,00:36:37.96,"switch. Jaime, what rationale went into"
605,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,picking James and Aaron? >> We wanted to break the other
606,00:36:43.38,00:36:43.38,"team, and by taking their two strongest they would be pretty"
607,00:36:45.58,00:36:45.58,"bad off. >> JEFF: Aaron, was this good"
608,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,"news for you, or was this, ""Oh, man, everything's going so good"
609,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"at Fei Long""? >> Everything was going great at"
610,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00,Fei Long. We were a really strong tribe.
611,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,"We had posted a winning record. And coming over here, we're the"
612,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,"new people, where it's three against two."
613,00:37:03.58,00:37:03.58,And to lose immunity was a big deal for us.
614,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,">> JEFF: I've got to say, we're at tribal council, the place"
615,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,"where most anybody in this game never wants to go, and Jaime's"
616,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"smiling, got a little... >> Yeah."
617,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,">> I'm not happy that I'm here, but I'm not trying to be all"
618,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"pissed off about it, either. >> She has the numbers and she's"
619,00:37:21.38,00:37:21.38,chillin'. >> JEFF: What happened at the
620,00:37:24.21,00:37:24.21,"challenge, Jaime? I've been around a little bit in"
621,00:37:26.29,00:37:26.29,this game. It appeared to me as though you
622,00:37:28.42,00:37:28.42,"had no concern about winning. >> You know, if we merge we're"
623,00:37:31.88,00:37:31.88,gone. They've got the numbers.
624,00:37:34.58,00:37:34.58,"As far as I'm concerned, I don't want to be stuck with someone"
625,00:37:37.54,00:37:37.54,that was going to go right back to the other side.
626,00:37:39.75,00:37:39.75,>> JEFF: So I'm judging by the lack of performance at today's
627,00:37:42.42,00:37:42.42,"challenge you've decided you can't trust Aaron and James, and"
628,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,"you threw the challenge. >> Yes, sir."
629,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,">> JEFF: So Peih-Gee, the big assumption you're making is"
630,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,what? >> Frosti and Sherea get voted
631,00:38:00.50,00:38:00.50,"off, and then suddenly we merge, guess what?"
632,00:38:02.50,00:38:02.50,"Now there's only three original Zhan Hu members, seven Fei Long."
633,00:38:05.54,00:38:05.54,"Hmm, I wonder who the next three to get picked off are going to"
634,00:38:08.12,00:38:08.12,"be? >> JEFF: James, this must drive"
635,00:38:10.33,00:38:10.33,you nuts to watch people come into a game that's really about
636,00:38:14.54,00:38:14.54,"winning, and see them continually lose, and then today"
637,00:38:17.25,00:38:17.25,willingly lose. >> And they're happy.
638,00:38:19.46,00:38:19.46,They're smiling. I could never do that.
639,00:38:22.12,00:38:22.12,>> It's about winning the war. It's not about winning the
640,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,battles. >> You're not winning nothing.
641,00:38:26.04,00:38:26.04,You ain't... >> James...
642,00:38:27.54,00:38:27.54,>> Then they asked me if I could stay.
643,00:38:29.21,00:38:29.21,That's the funny... ask them. Ask them.
644,00:38:30.92,00:38:30.92,>> I asked which one of you guys wanted to stay the most.
645,00:38:33.42,00:38:33.42,>> What kind of sense does that make?
646,00:38:35.46,00:38:35.46,What kind of dumb do you take me for?
647,00:38:37.42,00:38:37.42,That's why they lose. I told you all how I was going
648,00:38:39.88,00:38:39.88,to work. I can't work with losers.
649,00:38:41.88,00:38:41.88,"I can't do it. >> JEFF: So James, does that"
650,00:38:44.38,00:38:44.38,mean it's you tonight? >> It should be.
651,00:38:47.12,00:38:47.12,They know how I am about this losing thing.
652,00:38:49.83,00:38:49.83,They know how I am about not going 100%.
653,00:38:51.83,00:38:51.83,I can't just sit here and just watch these people dictate what
654,00:38:54.12,00:38:54.12,I'm going to do. But I really don't want to go.
655,00:38:56.88,00:38:56.88,I love being here. I love being here and
656,00:39:00.08,00:39:00.08,"interacting and all this stuff, but I just can't take another"
657,00:39:02.25,00:39:02.25,"loss like that. >> JEFF: Aaron, what about you?"
658,00:39:04.42,00:39:04.42,"Do you plead your case and say, ""Well, I'd like to stay two more"
659,00:39:07.08,00:39:07.08,"days, three more days, whatever you'll have me""?"
660,00:39:09.96,00:39:09.96,>> You know what? I want to be here as long as
661,00:39:13.04,00:39:13.04,possible. I want to compete in every
662,00:39:16.50,00:39:16.50,challenge. I want to be part of a team.
663,00:39:18.17,00:39:18.17,I want to last as long as I can. >> JEFF: So you feel comfortable
664,00:39:20.12,00:39:20.12,that you're okay tonight. >> I feel comfortable that I'm
665,00:39:22.42,00:39:22.42,"okay tonight, but I brought my bag anyway."
666,00:39:24.38,00:39:24.38,">> JEFF: Well, it's been pretty clearly established that it's"
667,00:39:28.42,00:39:28.42,going to be Aaron or James tonight.
668,00:39:31.50,00:39:31.50,So let's end the mystery and see who gets the guillotine.
669,00:39:34.33,00:39:34.33,"It is time to vote. Erik, you're up."
670,00:39:45.12,00:39:45.12,>> I wish I was sending all three of those home.
671,00:39:48.12,00:39:48.12,It's good to do battle with you. >> This is because I'm sticking
672,00:40:01.75,00:40:01.75,with my original teammates. That's all I'm going with.
673,00:40:15.62,00:40:15.62,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
674,00:40:27.29,00:40:27.29,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
675,00:40:29.17,00:40:29.17,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
676,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
677,00:40:35.29,00:40:35.29,"First vote, Peih-Gee. James."
678,00:40:41.46,00:40:41.46,"One vote Peih-Gee, one vote James."
679,00:40:46.12,00:40:46.12,"Aaron. One vote Peih-Gee, one vote"
680,00:40:48.00,00:40:48.00,"James, one vote Aaron. Aaron."
681,00:40:54.04,00:40:54.04,"Two votes Aaron. One vote Peih-Gee, one vote"
682,00:40:56.42,00:40:56.42,James. Fifth person voted out
683,00:41:00.92,00:41:00.92,"of Survivor: China, Aaron. That's three, that's enough."
684,00:41:03.79,00:41:03.79,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Take care, guys."
685,00:41:16.92,00:41:16.92,">> JEFF: Aaron, the tribe has spoken."
686,00:41:20.17,00:41:20.17,"It's time for you to go. Well, Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik, you"
687,00:41:35.71,00:41:35.71,three are making a very strategic play.
688,00:41:38.21,00:41:38.21,"If your assumptions about the game hold true, it could be a"
689,00:41:40.21,00:41:40.21,"good play. If your assumptions are wrong,"
690,00:41:42.38,00:41:42.38,"could be trouble. Grab your torches, head back to"
691,00:41:45.17,00:41:45.17,camp. Good night.
