6,00:00:15.25,00:00:15.25,she's got to be the luckiestgirl in Survivor history.
7,00:00:22.12,00:00:22.12,>> I would prefer if Jean-Robertgoes next because he's just so

19,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,challenges.>> I'm getting frustrated
20,00:00:55.54,00:00:55.54,because Sherea is trying to getaway with not helping out.

30,00:01:32.62,00:01:32.62,"both of them, it would be great.>> JEFF: But at tribal council,"
31,00:01:37.62,00:01:37.62,Sherea convinced the tribe ofher value.

44,00:02:37.21,00:02:37.21,We should have a really strongteam now.
45,00:02:39.62,00:02:39.62,"But the problem is Fei Long,they also have a very strong"
46,00:02:41.75,00:02:41.75,team.They're well led by Aaron.
47,00:02:44.04,00:02:44.04,"They've got the strongestplayer, James, and some very"
48,00:02:47.54,00:02:47.54,intelligent people.So they're a hard team to beat.

50,00:02:52.88,00:02:52.88,"equally in every aspect, thatway we're all strong here."
51,00:02:57.54,00:02:57.54,We're all strong at challenges.It sounds like that's what that
52,00:03:00.25,00:03:00.25,"other tribe is doing.I mean, it helps that they have"
53,00:03:03.79,00:03:03.79,"James, but...>> I definitely feel like the"
54,00:03:06.12,00:03:06.12,outsider in the tribe justbecause the four of them kind of
55,00:03:08.71,00:03:08.71,clique up sometimes.So I want to spice things up.
56,00:03:11.42,00:03:11.42,I want some drama or somethinggoing on.
57,00:03:13.54,00:03:13.54,I'm really looking for forwardto something changing.

63,00:04:40.38,00:04:40.38,It's biblical in the sense thatthere's man and woman and we
64,00:04:43.04,00:04:43.04,like hanging out.What's yours?
65,00:04:45.92,00:04:45.92,>> Nicole.>> Jaime Nicole Dugan.

69,00:04:55.08,00:04:55.08,days now.I don't know what's wrong with
70,00:04:57.00,00:04:57.00,him.I can't find anything wrong with
71,00:04:58.67,00:04:58.67,him so far.He's really attractive.
72,00:05:00.42,00:05:00.42,">> I like you a lot, so...>> All right."
73,00:05:05.46,00:05:05.46,">> I just want to get mythoughts out, just to know that"

75,00:05:10.12,00:05:10.12,I just... I'm a virgin.>> Really?
76,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,">> Yeah.A few years ago I was like, ""I'm"
77,00:05:17.62,00:05:17.62,"not ready.""And I said it was because I was"
78,00:05:20.46,00:05:20.46,"too young, but it was reallybecause I think I wasn't finding"
79,00:05:23.38,00:05:23.38,the right person.>> I think it's great that Erik
80,00:05:26.71,00:05:26.71,"is still a virgin, you know.I think it does prove that he's"
81,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,even more trustworthy than Ieven thought before.
82,00:05:35.92,00:05:35.92,So I'm trying to make it withhim all the way through.
83,00:05:48.96,00:05:48.96,>> Yeah.The new word on the street is
84,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,"that there's an immunity idol,and Jaime wants to entrust me"
85,00:05:54.96,00:05:54.96,with the information.That's going to hopefully help
86,00:05:57.12,00:05:57.12,in the game.I don't know what's going to
87,00:05:59.50,00:05:59.50,"happen with Jaime and I'srelationship, but she seems like"
88,00:06:03.00,00:06:03.00,a good all-around person to bealigned with right now at this
89,00:06:05.29,00:06:05.29,stage of the game.>> It's going to be another hot
90,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,"one, guys.>> Another glorious morning here"
91,00:06:22.08,00:06:22.08,in China.>> I am carrying most of the
92,00:06:29.83,00:06:29.83,"tribe's weight as far as workand the challenges, but Denise"
93,00:06:33.21,00:06:33.21,really does bust her ass outhere.
94,00:06:35.83,00:06:35.83,She's the other one that reallypulls the rope around here.
95,00:06:38.21,00:06:38.21,"I mean, you can't beat that.I like women like her."
96,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,"She's a strong, good woman.She's there to complement you"
97,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,and work with you.That's attractive.
98,00:06:46.54,00:06:46.54,I like that.If Denise was ten years younger
99,00:06:49.58,00:06:49.58,"or if I was older, whicheverway, Denise would be in trouble."
100,00:06:53.58,00:06:53.58,"Yeah.Damn, that's enough to eat."
101,00:06:55.92,00:06:55.92,>> We should have brought abucket and filled it up with
102,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,some water.Right now the person I trust
103,00:06:59.58,00:06:59.58,most is James.Him and I get along very well.
104,00:07:02.38,00:07:02.38,>> You think this rice willwork?
105,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,They like rice.>> He picked up on my work

107,00:07:08.58,00:07:08.58,Him and I seem to have a littleconnection going.
108,00:07:15.08,00:07:15.08,>> I can trust him and know Ican stick with him and ride his
109,00:07:17.38,00:07:17.38,"coattail as Long as I can.>> James, how is our breakfast"
110,00:07:22.21,00:07:22.21,"coming along, boss?You're the cook."

115,00:07:43.12,00:07:43.12,">> Hi, thank you.>> Hello."
116,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,">> Hi.We have a message, guys."
117,00:07:46.96,00:07:46.96,"Should we read it?Uh-oh, hold on, hold on."

124,00:08:10.29,00:08:10.29,">> Well, the catch will probablybe that they get to pick two of"
125,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,"ours, and they're going to pick,obviously, like, you and James,"
126,00:08:15.08,00:08:15.08,"Aaron.>> But, I mean, it's not about"
127,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,strength all the time.>> It pretty much is about
128,00:08:19.25,00:08:19.25,strength.>> I think someone's going to
129,00:08:22.00,00:08:22.00,get switched for sure on ourtribe.
130,00:08:24.08,00:08:24.08,I think that they're probablygoing to have a note quite
131,00:08:26.08,00:08:26.08,"similar that says, you know,""Circle two people from the"
132,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,"other tribe that you think willbenefit yours, and they are now"

134,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,But the situation at camp rightnow is we have to pick two
135,00:08:34.12,00:08:34.12,members from the other tribe.>> Okay.

139,00:08:42.17,00:08:42.17,">> I'd say Frosti.>> Okay, Frosti is the number"
140,00:08:44.21,00:08:44.21,one pick.>> Do you think it's Frosti and
141,00:08:46.00,00:08:46.00,Sherea?>> I think that's a smart move.
142,00:08:48.12,00:08:48.12,">> All right, do it up.>> Okay, fine."
143,00:08:50.62,00:08:50.62,>> Frosti and Sherea.>> All right.
144,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,>> We think that Frosti andSherea will benefit our camp
145,00:08:55.71,00:08:55.71,"because they're both tough,they're both strong and fast,"
146,00:08:57.75,00:08:57.75,"and, you know, they seem likegood people."
147,00:09:00.38,00:09:00.38,But it's kind of crazy.It's almost like everything
148,00:09:02.58,00:09:02.58,you've devised has to be put onpause for a few minutes while
149,00:09:04.71,00:09:04.71,"you figure new things out.>> James, if they get the same"
150,00:09:11.46,00:09:11.46,"note, they are 100% picking you.>> ""Zhan Hu, choose the two"

171,00:10:08.42,00:10:08.42,">> Yeah, if we got Aaron then wewould be able to vote him out."
172,00:10:10.12,00:10:10.12,>> We could just vote him off.If we lose he would be the first
173,00:10:11.92,00:10:11.92,one to go and we don't have toworry about us.

180,00:10:25.08,00:10:25.08,And we have a huge advantage.We have all the strongest
181,00:10:26.88,00:10:26.88,players.So it's looking really good for
182,00:10:29.62,00:10:29.62,"us.>> All right, come on, guys."

191,00:10:53.25,00:10:53.25,>> This is so weird.>> What?
192,00:10:57.79,00:10:57.79,>> Oh!>> Oh!
193,00:11:07.08,00:11:07.08,>> Apparently that wasn't theend of the twist.
194,00:11:09.58,00:11:09.58,"Seems Fei Long picked two peoplefrom Zhan Hu, and those people"
195,00:11:13.50,00:11:13.50,"were Sherea and myself.>> Oh, my god."
196,00:11:15.88,00:11:15.88,>> I don't even know what tosay.

201,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,"That was really dumb.>> Whatever we're going to do,"
202,00:11:27.92,00:11:27.92,"we're just going to do our bestto stay in it, you know."
203,00:11:29.79,00:11:29.79,"No matter what happens, you guyshave control of the two biggest"

232,00:13:22.96,00:13:22.96,into the system again.>> We're giving up our two

240,00:13:51.58,00:13:51.58,things change for the bad.>> That means that Jean-Robert
241,00:13:53.88,00:13:53.88,is going to have to actuallymove his ass and get water.
242,00:13:57.88,00:13:57.88,">> We should probably talkabout, before those guys get"

250,00:14:17.62,00:14:17.62,">> The popular thing would be,""Well, you know, Jean-Robert,"

303,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,"game.I mean, it's a major advantage."
304,00:17:07.25,00:17:07.25,It's just what we choose to dowith it.
305,00:17:10.54,00:17:10.54,>> Thank you for welcoming us.>> Here they come.

311,00:17:27.71,00:17:27.71,>> You guys are Skinny Minnie.>> The fact that Frosti and
312,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00,"Sherea are coming over to ourside is kind of exciting,"
313,00:17:33.54,00:17:33.54,because I may be able to getgreat bonds with them.
314,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,So who knows what I can buildthere?
315,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83,>> It's a basket of food!( cheering )

318,00:17:49.83,00:17:49.83,again.So I'm going to do my best to
319,00:17:51.50,00:17:51.50,try to get to know them and tryto find my place and fit in.
320,00:17:53.29,00:17:53.29,>> Pop open one of thosebottles.
321,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,">> Welcome, tribe members.>> Welcome, you guys."
322,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,>> My position at Zhan Hu wasnot secure in the fact that I
323,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,wasn't the hardest worker atcamp.
324,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,So I'm hoping over here thatthey kind of see me in a
325,00:18:06.58,00:18:06.58,"different light, and maybe Ican, you know, step it up some."
326,00:18:11.71,00:18:11.71,>> We don't have any cooks.>> I can cook a little
327,00:18:13.38,00:18:13.38,something-something.>> I'll try and bring back clean
328,00:18:15.08,00:18:15.08,"fish, and you can cooksomething."
329,00:18:17.08,00:18:17.08,>> I can't believe I'm here.This place is so different.

331,00:18:21.33,00:18:21.33,me.Things are really messed up now.
332,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,>> I really wanted to see youguys' camp.
333,00:18:25.62,00:18:25.62,I just didn't know it was goingto be permanent.
334,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,"I'm out of my comfort zone,obviously, because I'm"
335,00:18:29.62,00:18:29.62,outnumbered by old Fei Longmembers with Sherea.
336,00:18:31.96,00:18:31.96,"My first goal is to figure outwhat's going on around here,"
337,00:18:35.21,00:18:35.21,"what kind of alliances I cansense, just see where I can put"
338,00:18:37.67,00:18:37.67,myself that's going to keep mearound.
339,00:18:57.33,00:18:57.33,>> Get a little rice going here.This morning I just felt like
340,00:19:00.96,00:19:00.96,giving us a little bit of a headstart because we lost our sous
341,00:19:04.17,00:19:04.17,"chef, Aaron and James.So I decided to come out here"
342,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,"and just try to build a fire.And since I got the fire going,"
343,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,I might as well start gettingthe rice going.
344,00:19:20.50,00:19:20.50,>> I know.Who is going to have to argue
345,00:19:22.58,00:19:22.58,"with him now, though?I don't want to argue with him"
346,00:19:24.38,00:19:24.38,anymore.>> Waking up to everybody
347,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,bashing Jean-Robert was betterthan the food that we got the
348,00:19:34.46,00:19:34.46,"night before.To me, that just makes me so"
349,00:19:37.38,00:19:37.38,much more comfortable knowingthat there's somebody here they
350,00:19:40.33,00:19:40.33,already have problems with.So it's looking like Jean-Robert
351,00:19:43.04,00:19:43.04,is in a bit of a pinch.>> I'm going to go check the
352,00:19:47.17,00:19:47.17,traps for shrimp.I started the rice.
353,00:19:49.46,00:19:49.46,"I mean, the rice is basicallydone."
354,00:19:52.08,00:19:52.08,">> Jean-Robert woke up earlythis morning, which he never"
355,00:19:54.71,00:19:54.71,"does, and he started cookingbreakfast for everybody."
356,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,He's trying to save his buttright now.
357,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,">> Denise, if you want, maybe wecan set out that second net."
358,00:20:06.38,00:20:06.38,>> What's that?>> I'm not the tribe leader.
359,00:20:09.50,00:20:09.50,I don't want to be tribe leader.I'm just saying what I want to
360,00:20:11.54,00:20:11.54,do.>> Huh?
361,00:20:13.38,00:20:13.38,I'm not handing out any orders.>> Okay.
362,00:20:19.75,00:20:19.75,>> I just asked for help withthe setting out of the net.
363,00:20:28.17,00:20:28.17,>> Thank you.Sherea can cook.
364,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,That's going to be real helpfulfor us.
365,00:20:32.42,00:20:32.42,"Maybe you can make some sort of,like, sardine fried rice for"
366,00:20:34.62,00:20:34.62,"Todd to start out with, and I'llbring back shrimp, and then you"
367,00:20:37.54,00:20:37.54,can make shrimp fried rice.That would be great.
368,00:20:40.08,00:20:40.08,">> Morning.>> Morning, everybody."
369,00:20:43.79,00:20:43.79,Welcome to Fei Long.I love it.
370,00:20:55.67,00:20:55.67,"I love it.>> Seems like right now, Jean-"
371,00:21:04.58,00:21:04.58,Robert is the one that gets oneverybody's nerves.
372,00:21:07.12,00:21:07.12,I definitely believe this couldbe the opening for me with the
373,00:21:09.12,00:21:09.12,way they kind of don't get alongwith Jean-Robert as great for
374,00:21:11.12,00:21:11.12,everybody.I'm definitely going to try to
375,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,make my way in there.>> That looked really cool when
376,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,"you guys pulled up, all, like,chilling on top of that boat."
377,00:21:31.58,00:21:31.58,">> Yeah.Yeah, it was beautiful."
378,00:21:33.75,00:21:33.75,We've got a super tribe righthere.
379,00:21:35.71,00:21:35.71,">> Yeah, we do.>> I mean, there isn't any"
380,00:21:37.67,00:21:37.67,reason why we shouldn't winagain and again and again.
381,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,>> Yeah.>> This is Zhan Hu.
382,00:21:42.83,00:21:42.83,"This is my new tribe.Erik and Peih-Gee and Jaime,"
383,00:21:46.46,00:21:46.46,"they're really awesome people,you know?"
384,00:21:50.04,00:21:50.04,And they're really solid.>> This is so much fun.
385,00:21:52.29,00:21:52.29,>> Uh-huh.>> I couldn't imagine a better
386,00:21:54.54,00:21:54.54,way to spend the summer.I feel comfortable here.
387,00:21:57.33,00:21:57.33,"I don't know how James feels,but we'll see."
388,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,">> James is amazingly...>> He's, like, the powerhouse."
389,00:22:03.29,00:22:03.29,Yeah.That's why... he's pretty much
390,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,the catalyst and why we'rewinning these challenges.
391,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,"You know, the only thing isthat, yes, James is good here."
392,00:22:11.33,00:22:11.33,"When we go to the merge, bad.Yeah."
393,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,Everyone has to consider howgreat of an athlete that James
394,00:22:17.71,00:22:17.71,"is.You know, and when there is a"
395,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,"merge that comes, you know, howdangerous he could be if he's"
396,00:22:23.21,00:22:23.21,a... what they call an immunityhog.
397,00:22:26.29,00:22:26.29,All of us are pretty much equal.James is physically a little bit
398,00:22:29.00,00:22:29.00,more than us.That is strategy talk.
399,00:22:32.29,00:22:32.29,"That was a subtle card I played,you know, just to save my butt"
400,00:22:34.67,00:22:34.67,just in case we do lose animmunity.
401,00:22:38.21,00:22:38.21,">> Aaron, okay, say we merge andJean-Robert is still left, would"
402,00:22:41.21,00:22:41.21,he be the first person once wemerged that you'd vote off?
403,00:22:49.54,00:22:49.54,>> Let me think about that.>> Aaron's smart.
404,00:22:53.21,00:22:53.21,"He's athletic, he's good-looking, which always helps"
405,00:22:55.29,00:22:55.29,"people like you a little more.>> I don't know, you know?"
406,00:22:59.08,00:22:59.08,>> But I think Aaron is a littlebit crafty.
407,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,He's probably holding a littlebit back.
408,00:23:04.96,00:23:04.96,"Now that we have Aaron and Jamesover here, Frosti and Sherea are"
409,00:23:07.92,00:23:07.92,over at the other camp.I don't know how long members of
410,00:23:11.88,00:23:11.88,my original alliance are goingto last over there.
411,00:23:15.04,00:23:15.04,So definitely I'm going to tryto pull Jaime aside and have a
412,00:23:17.08,00:23:17.08,"talk with her, see what shethinks of everything."
413,00:24:12.29,00:24:12.29,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys.How did you feel, Todd, when"
414,00:24:22.58,00:24:22.58,"Frosti and Sherea showed up?>> You know, Frosti and Sherea"
415,00:24:25.75,00:24:25.75,"are great, so I thought theywere a good asset to our tribe."
416,00:24:28.25,00:24:28.25,"I mean, we did lose two strong,awesome people, but we also"
417,00:24:31.29,00:24:31.29,gained two people that I'm sureare going to fight hard.
418,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,">> JEFF: Aaron, is this a goodmove for you?"
419,00:24:36.58,00:24:36.58,>> It puts us on the choppingblock as new members.
420,00:24:39.12,00:24:39.12,We really have to put up or shutup right here in this challenge
421,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"and make it happen, and win.If you win, you don't go home."
422,00:24:45.12,00:24:45.12,>> JEFF: Are you guys ready toget to your first challenge as
423,00:24:47.54,00:24:47.54,"new tribes?>> Yes, sir."
424,00:24:49.62,00:24:49.62,">> JEFF: First things first.Amanda, give it up."
425,00:24:52.83,00:24:52.83,">> Okay.>> JEFF: Once again, immunity is"
426,00:24:56.62,00:24:56.62,"back up for grabs.For today's challenge, two"
427,00:25:00.79,00:25:00.79,members of each tribe will swimout to a platform.
428,00:25:04.04,00:25:04.04,"You will then alternate divinginto a water, where you'll find"
429,00:25:06.96,00:25:06.96,a cage filled with 12 disksrepresenting the signs of the
430,00:25:10.25,00:25:10.25,Chinese zodiac.To release those disks you have
431,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,to remove as many bamboo polesas possible before resurfacing.
432,00:25:18.50,00:25:18.50,You'll then put all 12 disks ina boat and swim to shore.
433,00:25:22.08,00:25:22.08,The three remaining tribemembers will then match each
434,00:25:24.83,00:25:24.83,disk to its corresponding spoton the board by twisting it and
435,00:25:30.04,00:25:30.04,turning it until they lock intoplace.

564,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,"really, really want to keeptrusting you, you know?"
565,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> Yeah, definitely.>> Because I honestly want you"
566,00:33:55.92,00:33:55.92,and I to stick together...>> I think we should.
567,00:33:58.04,00:33:58.04,">> ...all the way to the finish,really."
568,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,">> Mm-hmm.>> I just don't like losing,"
569,00:34:02.71,00:34:02.71,"especially on purpose, but Iwant to remain in alliance with"
570,00:34:06.12,00:34:06.12,"Jaime, just because it's safefor now at least."
571,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,Do we definitely vote off Jamestonight?
572,00:34:16.92,00:34:16.92,">> Well, that's the thing.>> Would you rather..."
573,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,>> James is the one that was...>> Pissed.
574,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,>> Talking.I don't know why.
575,00:34:27.46,00:34:27.46,>> Okay.>> Aaron and James definitely
576,00:34:29.71,00:34:29.71,are on the chopping block.One of them's going home.
577,00:34:32.71,00:34:32.71,I just can't believe they didn'tfigure it out.
578,00:34:34.83,00:34:34.83,I mean...I trust James more than I do
579,00:34:36.92,00:34:36.92,Aaron for the simple fact that Ithink Aaron's made enough
580,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,alliances on the other sidewhere he thinks he's set over
581,00:34:42.25,00:34:42.25,there.And I think James probably
582,00:34:44.12,00:34:44.12,didn't have quite as many tiesat Fei Long.
583,00:34:46.71,00:34:46.71,So Aaron will be the first toget kicked off.
584,00:34:55.25,00:34:55.25,>> I don't know.I'm still shocked we lost so
585,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,bad.>> Aaron really deserves to
586,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,"stay.>> Yeah, send my ass home."
587,00:35:10.25,00:35:10.25,">> Well, originally we hadagreed the first one to go was"
588,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,going to be Aaron from the get-go.
589,00:35:14.58,00:35:14.58,And we thought that we might beable to get James onto our side.
590,00:35:17.21,00:35:17.21,"I think after what happenedtoday, he doesn't trust us at"
591,00:35:20.29,00:35:20.29,"all, which means that tonight attribal council, we probably will"
592,00:35:24.00,00:35:24.00,have to get rid of James.>> Who are you guys voting?
593,00:35:33.46,00:35:33.46,">> The girls said James, man.So I feel like I have to go with"
594,00:35:36.21,00:35:36.21,what they say.>> Right.
595,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,"I don't trust, really, anyonehere on Zhan Hu."
596,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"You know, I'm on the choppingblock, and James is on the"
597,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,chopping block.But I think James is going to go
598,00:35:46.79,00:35:46.79,"home.So at tonight's tribal council,"
599,00:35:50.67,00:35:50.67,I am going to vote for James.Just so I won't have to vote for
600,00:35:56.71,00:35:56.71,"Peih-Gee or I won't have to votefor Jaime or anything like that,"
601,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,"so there's no hard feelings orany kind of vendettas, you know."
602,00:36:02.29,00:36:02.29,So we'll see what happens.>> JEFF: So let's talk about the
603,00:36:37.96,00:36:37.96,"switch.Jaime, what rationale went into"
604,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,picking James and Aaron?>> We wanted to break the other
605,00:36:43.38,00:36:43.38,"team, and by taking their twostrongest they would be pretty"
606,00:36:45.58,00:36:45.58,"bad off.>> JEFF: Aaron, was this good"
607,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,"news for you, or was this, ""Oh,man, everything's going so good"
608,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"at Fei Long""?>> Everything was going great at"
609,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00,Fei Long.We were a really strong tribe.
610,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,"We had posted a winning record.And coming over here, we're the"
611,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,"new people, where it's threeagainst two."
612,00:37:03.58,00:37:03.58,And to lose immunity was a bigdeal for us.
613,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,">> JEFF: I've got to say, we'reat tribal council, the place"
614,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,"where most anybody in this gamenever wants to go, and Jaime's"
615,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"smiling, got a little...>> Yeah."

617,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"pissed off about it, either.>> She has the numbers and she's"

622,00:37:31.88,00:37:31.88,gone.They've got the numbers.
623,00:37:34.58,00:37:34.58,"As far as I'm concerned, I don'twant to be stuck with someone"
624,00:37:37.54,00:37:37.54,that was going to go right backto the other side.
625,00:37:39.75,00:37:39.75,>> JEFF: So I'm judging by thelack of performance at today's

627,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,"you threw the challenge.>> Yes, sir."
