3,00:00:04.33,00:00:04.33,each of the Villains were making plans for a possible

5,00:00:09.12,00:00:09.12,"of the Villain camp, complete control."

7,00:00:13.71,00:00:13.71,Parvati made moves of her own. >> Another immunity idol is
8,00:00:16.79,00:00:16.79,hidden at your camp. >> PROBST: She tracked down a
9,00:00:19.75,00:00:19.75,"hidden immunity idol, telling only her friend Danielle."
10,00:00:22.08,00:00:22.08,">> Right now, Russell doesn't need to know."
11,00:00:24.08,00:00:24.08,">> PROBST: While the outcasts, Courtney and Sandra, merely"
12,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,wanted to survive. >> It's inevitable that me or
13,00:00:30.04,00:00:30.04,Courtney are going home. >> PROBST: The Heroes were
14,00:00:33.21,00:00:33.21,"equally sure a merge was coming, and even more sure that Russell"
15,00:00:37.75,00:00:37.75,was on the outs with the Villains.
16,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,>> That women's alliance looks very strong.
17,00:00:43.29,00:00:43.29,>> PROBST: So they came up with a plan to pull in Russell by
18,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17,giving him an idol with instructions to take out
19,00:00:48.54,00:00:48.54,Parvati. >> This is your chance to show
20,00:00:51.08,00:00:51.08,you're not a Villain. >> PROBST: At the last immunity
21,00:00:53.29,00:00:53.29,challenge... >> Done.
22,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,>> PROBST: Heroes win immunity! ...the Heroes celebrated another
23,00:00:58.38,00:00:58.38,win as J.T. gave Russell an idol and a chance to become a hero.
24,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,(thunder rumbling) But Russell's a Villain.
25,00:01:06.92,00:01:06.92,>> You don't hand the enemy the idol.
26,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83,">> PROBST: In a brilliant double-cross, Russell kept both"
27,00:01:12.42,00:01:12.42,"the idol and his ally, Parvati..."
28,00:01:14.46,00:01:14.46,>> Shut up! >> PROBST: ...as he and his
29,00:01:16.83,00:01:16.83,"female accomplices laughed all the way to Tribal Council, where"
30,00:01:21.67,00:01:21.67,"they voted out Courtney. Courtney, the tribe has spoken."
31,00:01:25.12,00:01:25.12,"And Sandra was left all alone, angry at her own tribe."
32,00:01:28.62,00:01:28.62,"We are now even-- five Villains, five Heroes."
33,00:01:32.33,00:01:32.33,"With both tribes equal in number, the real battle is"
34,00:01:34.67,00:01:34.67,about to begin. Who will be voted out tonight
35,00:01:37.79,00:01:37.79,in Heroes vs. Villains? >> Day 25.
36,00:01:46.71,00:01:46.71,Man! >> We need a change.
37,00:01:51.92,00:01:51.92,>> I just want to see Russell and four girls.
38,00:01:54.96,00:01:54.96,>> Oh. We seriously better merge today.
39,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,">> I mean, it's just, like, ""Oh, day 25."""
40,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,"Something's got to happen, you know."
41,00:02:04.25,00:02:04.25,"Please, give us a merge. Give us a challenge."
42,00:02:06.58,00:02:06.58,Give us anything. >> This is exponentially worse
43,00:02:09.21,00:02:09.21,than I ever remember it. >> I hope we get treemail.
44,00:02:11.88,00:02:11.88,"That's all we can do. >> Us five, the family, have"
45,00:02:14.25,00:02:14.25,been together a pretty long time now.
46,00:02:16.54,00:02:16.54,It's taking its toll on us. >> I hope I'm not pissing
47,00:02:20.17,00:02:20.17,anybody off too much. >> I think we all are.
48,00:02:22.21,00:02:22.21,>> I try and keep quiet... >> I'm pretty sure I'm annoying
49,00:02:24.12,00:02:24.12,"someone. >> Oh. Oh, my gosh!"
50,00:02:27.08,00:02:27.08,">> What is this? >> ""Heroes..."""
51,00:02:31.00,00:02:31.00,">> BOTH: ""...do not open this box until you have the key."""
52,00:02:34.50,00:02:34.50,">> ""Make room in your camp."" >> BOTH: ""Company will be"
53,00:02:38.04,00:02:38.04,"arriving soon."" >> Oh, my gosh."
54,00:02:42.71,00:02:42.71,">> They're bringing the key. ""Company will be arriving soon."""
55,00:02:53.54,00:02:53.54,>> I wonder what that key is to. >> I know.
56,00:02:56.08,00:02:56.08,">> Oh, I hope it's a treasure. I do love treasure."
57,00:02:58.21,00:02:58.21,">> A hidden treasure. >> Oh, we've got something..."
58,00:03:01.29,00:03:01.29,">> You guys, it's an Hawaiian sling..."
59,00:03:03.54,00:03:03.54,>> That's a real one. >> ...with a key on it.
60,00:03:05.58,00:03:05.58,>> With a key. >> And a note.
61,00:03:07.58,00:03:07.58,>> A key? >> What is it the key to?
62,00:03:11.71,00:03:11.71,>> All right. (overlapping chatter)
63,00:03:13.71,00:03:13.71,>> A map! >> It's a map to the Heroes'
64,00:03:16.00,00:03:16.00,camp. >> Get the hell out of here.
65,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00,Let me see. >> Oh!
66,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,">> Oh, my God! >> Do we know...?"
67,00:03:25.04,00:03:25.04,>> We are merging! >> Do we know how to...? Okay.
68,00:03:27.21,00:03:27.21,">> We just got treemail, and it comes with a map to our new"
69,00:03:31.08,00:03:31.08,"home. If it is a merge, it's okay with"
70,00:03:34.08,00:03:34.08,"me, 'cause it's right up my alley."
71,00:03:36.25,00:03:36.25,We're going over to the Heroes home turf and weeding them out
72,00:03:39.04,00:03:39.04,one at a time. We know for a fact that I have
73,00:03:42.04,00:03:42.04,"to go to J.T., explain to him why Parvati's not gone."
74,00:03:44.75,00:03:44.75,>> We are going to go to J.T. and tell him you used his
75,00:03:46.75,00:03:46.75,"idol... >> Be, like, ""Than you."""
76,00:03:48.75,00:03:48.75,>> ...to save yourself last night.
77,00:03:50.75,00:03:50.75,"""Thank you."" You're going to play that."
78,00:03:52.75,00:03:52.75,">> He's going to say, ""Why didn't you vote Parvati out?"""
79,00:03:54.75,00:03:54.75,What I want to do is say that we both played an idol at the same
80,00:03:56.75,00:03:56.75,time. >> Because I thought the girls
81,00:04:01.21,00:04:01.21,were revolting. >> No.
82,00:04:03.21,00:04:03.21,">> So then when the next time we go to Tribal, you're going to"
83,00:04:05.21,00:04:05.21,tell them that you're voting with them.
84,00:04:07.21,00:04:07.21,>> Right. >> And they want Parvati off
85,00:04:09.21,00:04:09.21,first. >> Yeah.
86,00:04:11.21,00:04:11.21,>> Yeah? >> So then you're going to use
87,00:04:13.21,00:04:13.21,"the idol to save yourself, and then, who's going to go home,  "
88,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,"one of them? >> Yeah, J.T. will go home."
89,00:04:17.17,00:04:17.17,">> Shh. Shh. Quiet. >> With all the other Heroes, we"
90,00:04:19.38,00:04:19.38,"do. >> You know, Sandra's walking"
91,00:04:21.38,00:04:21.38,around. Just be quiet.
92,00:04:23.38,00:04:23.38,>> I know! >> So be quiet.
93,00:04:26.75,00:04:26.75,">> Right now, I do think I have the only hidden immunity idol"
94,00:04:30.12,00:04:30.12,in pocket. The people that know about it
95,00:04:32.79,00:04:32.79,"are the people that have to know about it-- my whole tribe,"
96,00:04:35.46,00:04:35.46,except for Sandra. We're not going to tell her
97,00:04:38.12,00:04:38.12,anything. That idol is going to help the
98,00:04:40.88,00:04:40.88,Villain tribe weed out one of their members on the Heroes'
99,00:04:44.12,00:04:44.12,tribe. I'm going have them eating out
100,00:04:46.33,00:04:46.33,"of my hands. >> Five of us, five of them."
101,00:04:49.67,00:04:49.67,They're going down in flames. >> Are we ready for war?
102,00:04:52.00,00:04:52.00,>> Villain flames. (theme song playing)

104,00:06:07.04,00:06:07.04,"have to watch out, 'cause the Villains are coming."
105,00:06:09.12,00:06:09.12,"Right now, Russell and I have both of the hidden immunity"
106,00:06:12.79,00:06:12.79,"idols that are in this game, which puts us in the king and"
107,00:06:15.54,00:06:15.54,queen position. >> Here they are.
108,00:06:17.54,00:06:17.54,Here they are. >> Huh?
109,00:06:19.54,00:06:19.54,">> Here they come. >> Well, the queen has to keep"
110,00:06:21.62,00:06:21.62,"some secrets, so I would like to keep my hidden immunity idol"
111,00:06:24.50,00:06:24.50,"a secret. Only my lady in waiting,"
112,00:06:27.33,00:06:27.33,"Danielle, knows about it, and the king will not know about my"
113,00:06:30.17,00:06:30.17,hidden immunity idol until the time is right.
114,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,">> This ought to be interesting. >> Oh, yes."
115,00:06:36.25,00:06:36.25,>> We need help! >> Heavy!
116,00:06:43.58,00:06:43.58,>> First thing I noticed when I looked down the beach and saw
117,00:06:46.79,00:06:46.79,"the Villains coming was Parvati. Then, you know, I saw Russell's"
118,00:06:50.42,00:06:50.42,"legs behind the Sears box, and I was, like, ""Oh, thank God."""
119,00:06:55.04,00:06:55.04,>> How are you? >> I got it.
120,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,"(overlapping chatter) >> Oh, my God."
121,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,>> My back. >> So I figured Russell played
122,00:07:01.12,00:07:01.12,the idol. Parvati had to have played an
123,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,"idol. Therefore, there's no idols in"
124,00:07:05.79,00:07:05.79,the game. Parvati's got to be the first
125,00:07:08.25,00:07:08.25,to go. It's a known fact.
126,00:07:10.25,00:07:10.25,">> Good to see you, brother. >> Brother."
127,00:07:12.25,00:07:12.25,">> What's up, Russ? Welcome aboard, my friend."
128,00:07:15.25,00:07:15.25,">> Hey, let's see what we got in the box."
129,00:07:17.25,00:07:17.25,(overlapping chatter) >> Yeah.
130,00:07:19.25,00:07:19.25,>> Yeah. (whooping and cheering)
131,00:07:21.25,00:07:21.25,">> Oh, fudge. >> ""Heroes and Villains, replace"
132,00:07:23.33,00:07:23.33,"your old buffs with the new ones."""
133,00:07:25.71,00:07:25.71,>> Yay! (cheering)
134,00:07:27.71,00:07:27.71,">> ""You must come with a new tribe name, design a new tribe"

137,00:07:33.71,00:07:33.71,(overlapping chatter) >> Hey there's ham.
138,00:07:35.71,00:07:35.71,(overlapping chatter) >> Be careful with the eggs
139,00:07:37.71,00:07:37.71,here. >> Oh!
140,00:07:39.71,00:07:39.71,>> It's a big ham. (Jerri whoops)
141,00:07:42.25,00:07:42.25,>> It's a party! >> Yum.
142,00:07:44.25,00:07:44.25,">> Oh, my God, that's so good. >> When the box got sprung open,"
143,00:07:49.79,00:07:49.79,"you know, the vegetables and fruit are flying, you still in"
144,00:07:54.25,00:07:54.25,"the back of your mind think, ""We're still two tribes,"" but"
145,00:07:57.92,00:07:57.92,"when the black buffs came out, that tells you real quick, old"
146,00:08:01.08,00:08:01.08,tribes are done. This is a whole new ball game.
147,00:08:11.42,00:08:11.42,>> Winners. >> The what?
148,00:08:19.33,00:08:19.33,>> We're all winners. We're all all-stars.
149,00:08:21.33,00:08:21.33,We're all something good and positive.
150,00:08:23.58,00:08:23.58,Why do you have to keep the Villain attitude?
151,00:08:26.17,00:08:26.17,But I guess that's what Villains do.
152,00:08:31.54,00:08:31.54,(overlapping chatter) >> It's in the... it's in the...
153,00:08:34.42,00:08:34.42,(overlapping chatter) >> Really?
154,00:08:36.42,00:08:36.42,">> Oh, you're not far from me at all."
155,00:08:38.42,00:08:38.42,>> No deal. I live in... >> Do you know I learned to weld
156,00:08:40.42,00:08:40.42,last year? >> Really?
157,00:08:42.42,00:08:42.42,">> I MIG weld, yeah. >> No way."
158,00:08:44.42,00:08:44.42,>> I built a covered wagon from scratch.
159,00:08:47.38,00:08:47.38,>> Conestoga wagon. No way. >> Yup.
160,00:08:49.38,00:08:49.38,>> He had a parasite in his butt.
161,00:08:51.38,00:08:51.38,You can see it. It's like a worm in his skin.
162,00:08:53.38,00:08:53.38,">> If I had that, I think I'd cut myself."
163,00:08:55.38,00:08:55.38,"Had to take it out. >> And it moves, and he can't"
164,00:08:57.38,00:08:57.38,get rid of it. >> Bamboo burns too quick.
165,00:09:01.04,00:09:01.04,>> It's hot. It's hot. >> You all right?
166,00:09:04.04,00:09:04.04,>> Fine. >> Parvati?
167,00:09:06.04,00:09:06.04,>> What? Nothing.
168,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,"Leave me alone! No, I don't want to talk."
169,00:09:11.21,00:09:11.21,None of the Heroes are happy that I'm here.
170,00:09:14.21,00:09:14.21,"They wanted to get rid of me before, and they're probably"
171,00:09:16.75,00:09:16.75,all be shocked that I'm still here.
172,00:09:19.08,00:09:19.08,"I definitely don't feel like I'm part of this tribe, so I'm"
173,00:09:21.58,00:09:21.58,thinking they're going to vote for me because they want me
174,00:09:24.21,00:09:24.21,"gone. Like, do these people think I'm"
175,00:09:26.50,00:09:26.50,stupid? >> Yeah.
176,00:09:28.50,00:09:28.50,">> Do they think I'm stupid? Like, Amanda's played with me"
177,00:09:30.58,00:09:30.58,before. >> They think they have the
178,00:09:32.58,00:09:32.58,"game right now, and let them think that."
179,00:09:34.58,00:09:34.58,Just play... play it like... >> That's what... That's what I
180,00:09:36.58,00:09:36.58,"am. I'm, like... >> Play right into it."
181,00:09:38.58,00:09:38.58,">> That's what I was doing, and now it's just, like, I'm over"
182,00:09:40.67,00:09:40.67,it. I'm offended by how these Heroes
183,00:09:44.00,00:09:44.00,"are treating me. They don't know it yet, but"
184,00:09:47.54,00:09:47.54,they're about to be picked off one by one.
185,00:09:51.46,00:09:51.46,Don't talk to me. It'll get you in trouble.
186,00:09:53.46,00:09:53.46,">> No, I won't. >> You know, this is the first"
187,00:10:07.21,00:10:07.21,time I've been comfortable since day four.
188,00:10:09.21,00:10:09.21,>> I imagine so. >> The hidden immunity idol?
189,00:10:17.88,00:10:17.88,>> When did she use it? >> We both stood up and looked
190,00:10:21.88,00:10:21.88,"at each other. >> Oh, man."
191,00:10:23.88,00:10:23.88,"(laughter) Oh, man."
192,00:10:33.17,00:10:33.17,>> So everybody but Courtney. And Courtney voted for Jerri.
193,00:10:35.17,00:10:35.17,Everybody else voted for Courtney.
194,00:10:38.38,00:10:38.38,This is where I stand. This is it for me.
195,00:10:41.08,00:10:41.08,So don't even have any doubt. >> I don't doubt you.
196,00:10:43.08,00:10:43.08,I don't doubt you. >> Don't have any...
197,00:10:45.08,00:10:45.08,Don't even worry. >> Just let this happen.
198,00:10:51.62,00:10:51.62,>> That's right. >> Just breathe.
199,00:10:53.62,00:10:53.62,>> Breathe. >> Breathe.
200,00:10:55.62,00:10:55.62,>> That's exactly right. >> Yeah.
201,00:11:05.92,00:11:05.92,>> Giving Russell the hidden immunity idol could blow up in
202,00:11:07.83,00:11:07.83,"my face. I mean, he could have never been"
203,00:11:09.96,00:11:09.96,"going home. You know, he could be the leader"
204,00:11:12.21,00:11:12.21,of the girls over there. Do I believe it?
205,00:11:14.25,00:11:14.25,"Not a chance in the world. So I mean, I trust him"
206,00:11:17.12,00:11:17.12,explicitly. >> Exactly right.
207,00:11:24.71,00:11:24.71,">> Hook, line, and sinker. They're biting everything I tell"
208,00:11:28.92,00:11:28.92,them. This is going to be way easier
209,00:11:31.92,00:11:31.92,than I thought. >> You're darn right.
210,00:11:36.17,00:11:36.17,>> That's right. >> That's good.
211,00:11:40.17,00:11:40.17,It's going to be a wonderful thing.
212,00:11:55.46,00:11:55.46,>> You know how some people forgive but don't forget?
213,00:11:58.46,00:11:58.46,"Well, I don't forgive and I don't forget."
214,00:12:00.75,00:12:00.75,The Heroes don't know that Russell is the kingpin and that
215,00:12:05.25,00:12:05.25,Parvati's his right-hand man. Russell's trying to play up this
216,00:12:08.54,00:12:08.54,thing like all these women are about to get rid of him.
217,00:12:12.33,00:12:12.33,I hope I get my revenge 'cause it's going to be good.
218,00:12:15.58,00:12:15.58,>> So what happened last night? >> Courtney's the last person
219,00:12:18.79,00:12:18.79,from my alliance. They didn't want me and Courtney
220,00:12:20.46,00:12:20.46,over here together. That's why Courtney had to go.
221,00:12:23.25,00:12:23.25,"I'm the last one standing and I have to be babysat, and if they"
222,00:12:26.12,00:12:26.12,"catch me talking, I'm gone next. You guys are done, starting with"
223,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,the men. You better-- I got to-- I got to
224,00:12:35.54,00:12:35.54,keep you on the low-low. I'll tell you on the low-low.
225,00:12:37.17,00:12:37.17,>> Right. Okay.
226,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,">> But whatever Russell says, agree to it, but he's lying if"
227,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,he says that the women are running the show.
228,00:12:44.58,00:12:44.58,>> Got you. Sandra just gave me some really
229,00:12:47.08,00:12:47.08,good information. Russell told us that Parvati
230,00:12:53.42,00:12:53.42,used her immunity idol last night.
231,00:12:56.50,00:12:56.50,That is not true. I don't know if we're getting
232,00:13:00.75,00:13:00.75,"played or not, but Russell might be running the show, and if"
233,00:13:06.33,00:13:06.33,Sandra is true-- and I have to believe Sandra-- Russell is
234,00:13:11.21,00:13:11.21,playing us. Boy.
235,00:13:16.04,00:13:16.04,This is where the game gets crazy.
236,00:13:28.29,00:13:28.29,">> All right, now scramble that joker up or them eggs are"
237,00:13:31.25,00:13:31.25,gonna be brown on the bottom. >> Do you guys want your egg
238,00:13:33.92,00:13:33.92,"boiled or scrambled? >> Oh, I don't care."
239,00:13:37.00,00:13:37.00,">> Um, whatever you guys do. >> Okay. Just asked"
240,00:13:39.08,00:13:39.08,if you cared. >> Whatever you have.
241,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,"Whatever you're inspired to make, I'll eat it."
242,00:13:43.04,00:13:43.04,>> Okay. (both chuckle) >> The egg is really good.
243,00:13:51.67,00:13:51.67,>> That is a damn good breakfast.
244,00:13:54.04,00:13:54.04,>> Yup. >> I'm gonna find a banana.
245,00:13:59.75,00:13:59.75,">> Oh, yeah. >> Oh, my God, it's like"
246,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,all I need. You're not hungry?
247,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,">> Y'all still got breakfast on me, don't ya?"
248,00:14:06.88,00:14:06.88,>> We just ate. >> Why do they want to
249,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,eat again? They can't be eating all
250,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,their food. >> Look at this one. (chuckles)
251,00:14:17.38,00:14:17.38,">> They're the greedy-ass, eating-ass, pain-in-the-ass"
252,00:14:20.08,00:14:20.08,"tribe. In our Hero tribe, coconuts are"
253,00:14:25.42,00:14:25.42,aplenty. Anyone can open any coconuts
254,00:14:29.42,00:14:29.42,they want. With the other food: the bananas
255,00:14:32.38,00:14:32.38,"the papayas, we divide that up a hundred-percent even."
256,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,I cannot wait to start voting some of these Villains out of
257,00:14:42.88,00:14:42.88,our camp. >> That's more than I eat
258,00:14:46.33,00:14:46.33,in three days. >> I'm already tired of 'em.
259,00:14:50.21,00:14:50.21,>> Not very good. >> And they've only been here
260,00:14:52.17,00:14:52.17,two days. >> This one might be.
261,00:14:53.83,00:14:53.83,It's rotten. >> Alls I'm saying you got
262,00:14:57.96,00:14:57.96,to watch 'em. You got to watch all of them.
263,00:15:00.21,00:15:00.21,If Russell is playing us... >> He's not.
264,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,>> Now listen to me. Don't be so quick.
265,00:15:06.17,00:15:06.17,"Let me just tell you the scenario, okay?"
266,00:15:08.21,00:15:08.21,"If Russell didn't use that damn immunity idol, and he's got all"
267,00:15:11.25,00:15:11.25,"of us voting for Parvati, those four can put one of us out."
268,00:15:15.08,00:15:15.08,>> But I'm telling you Parvati wouldn't be in this game if she
269,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,didn't play her idol. No question. I asked.
270,00:15:20.08,00:15:20.08,I believe that. >> I don't think so either.
271,00:15:22.25,00:15:22.25,>> You have faith in Russell. Don't trust him.
272,00:15:24.04,00:15:24.04,He's on the Villain side for a reason!
273,00:15:26.50,00:15:26.50,J.T. believes wholeheartedly that Russell is on our side
274,00:15:30.46,00:15:30.46,and indebted to us now. I don't.
275,00:15:34.92,00:15:34.92,So we might just plan on changing our five votes just
276,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,before we go in there; whoever Russell says.
277,00:15:40.04,00:15:40.04,">> Yep. >> We don't put that person, but"
278,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,"we look right at him and say, ""Okay. Stay the course."""
279,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,">> Yeah, we will do whatever it takes, the first vote."
280,00:15:46.17,00:15:46.17,">> We're together to the end, brother, to the end."
281,00:15:48.12,00:15:48.12,">> We're good. > All right, this is,"
282,00:15:49.58,00:15:49.58,this is... >> Rupert is really skeptical of
283,00:15:52.75,00:15:52.75,"Russell, so just to make sure Rupert's okay, the Heroes are"
284,00:15:56.00,00:15:56.00,"gonna tell Russell we're voting for someone, and then the five"
285,00:15:58.62,00:15:58.62,of us are gonna vote for someone else.
286,00:16:00.50,00:16:00.50,So it's good just to test. We don't want to make a dumb
287,00:16:03.33,00:16:03.33,"decision, and then be, you know, lose our lead."
288,00:16:06.79,00:16:06.79,That would be awful. You're getting paranoid.
289,00:16:09.08,00:16:09.08,">> You are. You're sweating, you're scaring yourself into"
290,00:16:12.00,00:16:12.00,a panic out here. You're not pulling...
291,00:16:14.29,00:16:14.29,>> I-I just want to make sure one of us... Fine.
292,00:16:18.25,00:16:18.25,>> Rupert-- (laughs) there's a reason that I've been doings a
293,00:16:20.58,00:16:20.58,Rupert strategical play for him thus far because he needs
294,00:16:24.12,00:16:24.12,"to be told where to vote by someone he can really trust,"
295,00:16:27.46,00:16:27.46,and let that be done. So I just keep reminding him
296,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33,"of that, like, ""Rupert, think ""about this a minute."
297,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,"""Do you believe what Sandra ""told you or do you believe"
298,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,the obvious truth? I mean...
299,00:16:41.17,00:16:41.17,">> It's, it's smelling fishy. >> If Sandra's story turns out"
300,00:16:46.46,00:16:46.46,"be true, and Russell did not play the idol, then that means"
301,00:16:50.96,00:16:50.96,I'm probably going home the next Tribal Council.
302,00:16:53.21,00:16:53.21,I don't know. Do I believe it?
303,00:16:54.79,00:16:54.79,Not a chance in the world. But you never know in this game.
304,00:16:57.92,00:16:57.92,>> Russell looked me right in the eye and swore on his kid's
305,00:17:00.29,00:17:00.29,"life that he was with us. And anybody that will do that,"
306,00:17:05.25,00:17:05.25,right away I don't trust 'em. >> Okay.
307,00:17:08.38,00:17:08.38,">> Okay, then don't trust Russell."
308,00:17:41.25,00:17:41.25,>> About you? >> About you.
309,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,>> They're gonna try to vote me out.
310,00:17:44.75,00:17:44.75,">> Yeah, they want you gone. Like, that's why I don't know"
311,00:17:47.33,00:17:47.33,"what to do 'cause it's weird, Parvati."
312,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,"Like, I have no power over here. Like, everyone's freaked out"
313,00:17:52.29,00:17:52.29,about you. >> I don't know. I just...
314,00:17:56.42,00:17:56.42,"So if I don't win today, then they're voting for me?"
315,00:17:59.29,00:17:59.29,>> Probably. >> And Russell with probably
316,00:18:01.04,00:18:01.04,vote with them. >> To get with Sandra?
317,00:18:07.00,00:18:07.00,>> Rid of Sandra. >> Amanda and I got a chance to
318,00:18:15.62,00:18:15.62,"talk for the first time sinceto the merge, and I think I got"
319,00:18:19.83,00:18:19.83,probably half her story. So I haven't decided the best
320,00:18:22.54,00:18:22.54,"plan yet because with her, I don't know if she's telling me"
321,00:18:26.88,00:18:26.88,the truth or not. Will you tell me who everyone's
322,00:18:30.96,00:18:30.96,voting for? >> Yeah.
323,00:18:31.96,00:18:31.96,">> Just at least tell me. >> No, I will."
324,00:18:34.04,00:18:34.04,>> Okay. Do you swear you're gonna be really honest with me?
325,00:18:36.25,00:18:36.25,">> Yes, I have been. I told you all that stuff."
326,00:18:38.71,00:18:38.71,">> Okay, so then I have to tell you something."
327,00:18:41.50,00:18:41.50,>> Okay. >> You have another one?
328,00:18:45.54,00:18:45.54,>> Yeah. >> How did you get another one?
329,00:18:47.29,00:18:47.29,>> I'm crafty. (laughs) >> Love it. Loving it.
330,00:18:50.88,00:18:50.88,I had a conversation with Parvati.
331,00:18:52.29,00:18:52.29,"I didn't tell her everything, but I told her enough to get"
332,00:18:55.08,00:18:55.08,"her to trust me, and she told me that she had the idol."
333,00:18:58.71,00:18:58.71,"And I like Parvati and everything, but she makes it to"
334,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"the end of this game, she's gonna win again."
335,00:19:03.46,00:19:03.46,">> If we're working together, then we're working together"
336,00:19:05.42,00:19:05.42,"and I trust you. However the vote shakes down,"
337,00:19:11.04,00:19:11.04,"I'm gonna make sure my butt is safe, no matter what."
338,00:19:14.08,00:19:14.08,But I'm gonna try to make it work that none of our Villains
339,00:19:19.17,00:19:19.17,are going anywhere tonight. >> But you trust me?
340,00:19:21.92,00:19:21.92,>> I trust you. >> I trust you.
341,00:19:23.33,00:19:23.33,Should we do a secret handshake? >> Yeah.
342,00:19:26.08,00:19:26.08,>> Blow it up. (both laugh)
343,00:19:37.29,00:19:37.29,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You're now merged as one tribe."
344,00:19:49.54,00:19:49.54,"What's the new tribe name? >> Uh, Yin Yang."
345,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,"It means good and evil. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
346,00:19:56.00,00:19:56.00,ready to get to your first individual immunity challenge?
347,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,>> Yes. >> Yeah.
348,00:19:59.79,00:19:59.79,">> PROBST: All right, first things first, I will take back"
349,00:20:02.12,00:20:02.12,the immunity idol. Tribal immunity is no more.
350,00:20:10.62,00:20:10.62,Individual immunity is what you seek.
351,00:20:15.33,00:20:15.33,"For today's challenge, it's very simple."
352,00:20:17.71,00:20:17.71,You will hold onto a pole for as long as you can.
353,00:20:21.67,00:20:21.67,"If you fall off, you're out of the challenge."
354,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,"Last person left hanging on their pole wins immunity,"
355,00:20:28.04,00:20:28.04,guaranteed a one-in-nine shot at winning this game and the
356,00:20:32.88,00:20:32.88,"million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council."
357,00:20:34.83,00:20:34.83,Somebody will be going home. Make sense?
358,00:20:36.96,00:20:36.96,">> Yes. >> PROBST: We'll draw for spots,"
359,00:20:38.54,00:20:38.54,"we'll get started. All right, everybody climb up."
360,00:20:43.75,00:20:43.75,"take your spots. >> Oh, here we go."
361,00:20:48.54,00:20:48.54,"It's kinda hot up here. >> Oh, my God."
362,00:20:50.79,00:20:50.79,">> Geez. >> Oh, my God, this is scary."
363,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,">> Oh, my gosh. >> PROBST: And this challenge"
364,00:21:02.50,00:21:02.50,is on. Everybody finding their spot.
365,00:21:06.46,00:21:06.46,"Amanda, Donaldson and Sandra slowly inching down the post."
366,00:21:13.12,00:21:13.12,"Could be a good strategy, could be a sign they're in trouble."
367,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,"J.T., Candice and Parvati have all competed in this challenge"
368,00:21:22.25,00:21:22.25,in previous seasons. None of them have won this
369,00:21:25.54,00:21:25.54,challenge. >> My leg won't stop shaking.
370,00:21:31.08,00:21:31.08,>> PROBST: Sandra already in trouble seconds into this
371,00:21:34.00,00:21:34.00,challenge. >> I can't get right.
372,00:21:36.96,00:21:36.96,">> Yeah, I hear ya. You want to do it at the same"
373,00:21:39.25,00:21:39.25,"time? One, two, three."
374,00:21:42.71,00:21:42.71,Donaldson steps down. (Sandra groans)
375,00:21:45.33,00:21:45.33,Colby-- first person out of this challenge.
376,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,Sandra steps down. Sandra's now out of the
377,00:21:50.83,00:21:50.83,"challenge. Colby, disappointed how fast"
378,00:21:55.04,00:21:55.04,you were out or is something going on?
379,00:21:56.71,00:21:56.71,">> I knew, I knew it was gonna be quick for me, yeah."
380,00:21:59.25,00:21:59.25,>> PROBST: How come? >> Just based on that last
381,00:22:01.12,00:22:01.12,challenge we did with the footholds.
382,00:22:02.88,00:22:02.88,"Not my forte, that's for sure. >> PROBST: We're down to eight."
383,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,"We are one minute into this challenge, and already, people"
384,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,are struggling. Rupert adjusting.
385,00:22:16.92,00:22:16.92,"Very little room for your toes. Candice, Danielle and Parvati"
386,00:22:26.04,00:22:26.04,"all look very solid. Amanda looks very solid,"
387,00:22:30.33,00:22:30.33,although she is low on the post.
388,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,Russell trying to get comfortable.
389,00:22:39.04,00:22:39.04,And Russell steps out of the challenge.
390,00:22:41.79,00:22:41.79,Take a spot on the bench. We are down to seven people left
391,00:22:45.96,00:22:45.96,in this challenge. (Danielle exhales sharply)
392,00:22:53.17,00:22:53.17,(Rupert groans) Rupert struggling.
393,00:22:56.38,00:22:56.38,Hanging on for dear life. (Rupert groans)
394,00:23:00.08,00:23:00.08,Rupert is out of the challenge. (Rupert groans)
395,00:23:02.12,00:23:02.12,And we are down to six people left in this challenge.
396,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,(Danielle exhales sharply) Been up there just over
397,00:23:19.08,00:23:19.08,20 minutes. Amanda steps out of the
398,00:23:27.00,00:23:27.00,challenge. We are down to five people left
399,00:23:30.79,00:23:30.79,in this challenge. (J.T. grunts)
400,00:23:34.04,00:23:34.04,">> Ah, you thought I was gone, didn't you?"
401,00:23:36.46,00:23:36.46,">> I was, like, ""What""? >> No, I was just getting"
402,00:23:39.12,00:23:39.12,"a little break. >> PROBST: J.T., were you just"
403,00:23:41.67,00:23:41.67,"playing around? >> No, I almost fell."
404,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,"(Jerri, Danielle laugh) >> PROBST: J.T. readjusting all"
405,00:23:58.75,00:23:58.75,over the place now. (J.T. groans)
406,00:24:04.62,00:24:04.62,"(J.T. groans) J.T, drops out of the challenge"
407,00:24:07.04,00:24:07.04,"without warning. >> Oh, I didn't see!"
408,00:24:09.25,00:24:09.25,>> PROBST: We are now down to four people left in this
409,00:24:13.08,00:24:13.08,"challenge, and they are all women."
410,00:24:15.29,00:24:15.29,Candice the lone remaining Hero. (Parvati chuckles)
411,00:24:36.08,00:24:36.08,">> Geez, Parvati, how in the heck are you staying on"
412,00:24:38.83,00:24:38.83,like that? Wow.
413,00:24:41.96,00:24:41.96,(Parvati chuckles) I think I'm about done.
414,00:24:46.75,00:24:46.75,"I can handle the pain, It's the dehydration."
415,00:24:50.29,00:24:50.29,">> PROBST: Yeah, starting to get to you?"
416,00:24:52.00,00:24:52.00,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Jerri moving down to
417,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,the lowest foothold. Nowhere else to go.
418,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,"Arms are shaking, legs are shaking."
419,00:25:01.50,00:25:01.50,>> Good job. >> PROBST: Jerri steps out of
420,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,"the challenge after one hour, 30 minutes."
421,00:25:05.21,00:25:05.21,">> Good job, Jerri. >> Good job, Jerri."
422,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,>> The bad thing is we drank your water.
423,00:25:09.21,00:25:09.21,(Jerri laughs) >> PROBST: We are now down
424,00:25:11.38,00:25:11.38,to three. Candice and Parvati were in
425,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,their own showdown back in the Cook Islands.
426,00:25:17.79,00:25:17.79,Danielle has never done this challenge.
427,00:25:19.71,00:25:19.71,She's sitting right in between the two of them.
428,00:25:22.04,00:25:22.04,"Now been out here one hour, 35 minutes."
429,00:25:29.88,00:25:29.88,">> All right, girls, good luck. >> PROBST: What'd you say,"
430,00:25:35.67,00:25:35.67,Candice? You're stepping down?
431,00:25:37.58,00:25:37.58,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Wow.
432,00:25:39.58,00:25:39.58,"Before you step down, Candice, I'm curious why in a challenge"
433,00:25:45.21,00:25:45.21,"for immunity in which of all the people who've played it, you"
434,00:25:49.25,00:25:49.25,lasted the longest. You're the odds-on favorite
435,00:25:52.83,00:25:52.83,to win. You're now-- for no reason--
436,00:25:55.12,00:25:55.12,just going to bow out of the challenge.
437,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,>> They look like they could go for a while.
438,00:26:00.92,00:26:00.92,It's true. >> PROBST: Step out.
439,00:26:04.17,00:26:04.17,"And with that, Candice steps off the post and is out of"
440,00:26:07.29,00:26:07.29,"the challenge. >> Good job, Candice."
441,00:26:09.38,00:26:09.38,">> Thanks. >> Good job, Candice."
442,00:26:11.38,00:26:11.38,>> PROBST: And we are now down to two.
443,00:26:13.17,00:26:13.17,All the Heroes are gone. >> How you doing?
444,00:26:16.00,00:26:16.00,>> I'm cool. >> You're cool?
445,00:26:17.46,00:26:17.46,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Two Villains left,"
446,00:26:19.08,00:26:19.08,and immediately they start to talk.
447,00:26:30.04,00:26:30.04,">> All right, this one's all yours."
448,00:26:33.42,00:26:33.42,">> PROBST: Parvati appears to be stepping out of this challenge,"
449,00:26:38.21,00:26:38.21,"and she does. And with that, Danielle wins"
450,00:26:41.17,00:26:41.17,first individual immunity. (applause)
451,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,"(Danielle grunts) >> Good job, Danielle."
452,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,">> Nice, Danielle. >> Thank you."
453,00:26:53.21,00:26:53.21,Yay! >> PROBST: Congratulations.
454,00:26:56.58,00:26:56.58,Danielle safe tonight at Tribal Council.
455,00:26:59.67,00:26:59.67,"As for the rest of you, after 27 days, one of you going"
456,00:27:03.62,00:27:03.62,home tonight. You have the afternoon to figure
457,00:27:05.62,00:27:05.62,out who it's gonna be. Head back to camp.
458,00:27:07.58,00:27:07.58,I'll see you at Tribal. Congratulations.
459,00:27:09.92,00:27:09.92,>> Yes! >> I think Parvati is gonna come
460,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,up with a hidden immunity idol tonight.
461,00:27:14.62,00:27:14.62,"But Parvati wouldn't have walked off that pole, but I don't know."
462,00:27:18.25,00:27:18.25,That's all part of the plan tonight; to see if I can oust
463,00:27:21.50,00:27:21.50,Russell for the weasel that he is.
464,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,>> It's kinda strange how Parvati stepped down at the end
465,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"of the challenge, you know? And she's in such danger and she"
466,00:27:47.75,00:27:47.75,"knows it. So the plans are, tonight,"
467,00:27:51.21,00:27:51.21,the Heroes are gonna let Russell write Parvati's name
468,00:27:53.42,00:27:53.42,down just to prove his loyalty to all of of us.
469,00:27:57.38,00:27:57.38,"Me and Candice and Rupert, Amanda, Colby-- five strong--"
470,00:28:02.71,00:28:02.71,will write down Sandra or Jerri's name.
471,00:28:11.58,00:28:11.58,">> Right, yeah. >> Sandra?"
472,00:28:16.88,00:28:16.88,Jerri done a hell of a lot better than Sandra did.
473,00:28:29.38,00:28:29.38,>> I don't even care who goes home.
474,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,>> I don't either as long as it's not me.
475,00:28:33.29,00:28:33.29,">> As long as it ain't us. When we come back tonight,"
476,00:28:36.25,00:28:36.25,"they'll be real mad, like, ""What in the hell just happened?"""
477,00:28:39.04,00:28:39.04,>> They think that they got this in the bag.
478,00:28:40.88,00:28:40.88,Which tells me that Russell's doing a good job of convincing
479,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,"them. >> When I first got here, I"
480,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,tried to tell Rupert that Russell is running this
481,00:28:50.83,00:28:50.83,"whole show. And anyway, we talked really,"
482,00:28:53.00,00:28:53.00,"really quick, and that was it. I don't want my big mouth"
483,00:28:59.96,00:28:59.96,to get me in trouble. I still want Russell out bad.
484,00:29:04.75,00:29:04.75,But right now I'm stuck with Russell.
485,00:29:09.54,00:29:09.54,I'm stuck with Russell. >> My plan A is to give the idol
486,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,"to Parvati, save herself, and vote out J.T."
487,00:29:23.38,00:29:23.38,I don't have a plan B. But I hope for the second time
488,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,I'm gonna save her with a immunity idol.
489,00:29:29.38,00:29:29.38,"I have a gift for you. If it was just me, it'd be just"
490,00:29:33.25,00:29:33.25,"me, but I got to keep these four girls on my Villain tribe"
491,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,"so I can get rid of J.T. >> Oh, you!"
492,00:29:40.92,00:29:40.92,You shouldn't have! >> There you go.
493,00:29:44.62,00:29:44.62,"(Parvati laughs) Thanks, honey. (chuckles)"
494,00:29:47.50,00:29:47.50,Russell just gave me his immunity idol.
495,00:29:49.46,00:29:49.46,So that makes me safe for for tonight.
496,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,And I have my own immunity idol.
497,00:29:59.42,00:29:59.42,That also makes me safe for the rest of the game.
498,00:30:03.08,00:30:03.08,It's like two little green men protecting me.
499,00:30:06.00,00:30:06.00,"And apparently everyone else in this game is, like, desperate"
500,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,to get rid of me. And they said that I'm the most
501,00:30:12.21,00:30:12.21,dangerous player out here. So I don't know.
502,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,I guess they're right. I didn't really think they were
503,00:30:16.67,00:30:16.67,right until right now. Now I really think they're
504,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,right. (chuckles) >> What? Being on
505,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,separate tribes? >> Yeah.
506,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,>> I know. >> Because I honestly don't know
507,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"what to do. I want to play with you, but I"
508,00:30:38.42,00:30:38.42,don't see how we're gonna play together.
509,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,So the idea is to have Parvati play her idol and
510,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,vote out Sandra or Jerri. It'll be really crazy tonight if
511,00:30:48.38,00:30:48.38,Parvati gives her idol to to somebody.
512,00:30:50.08,00:30:50.08,I hope she doesn't. I hope she plays it for herself
513,00:30:52.62,00:30:52.62,"just so... I mean, it's always good."
514,00:30:55.96,00:30:55.96,You never want idols floating around.
515,00:30:58.29,00:30:58.29,It just ruins things. She's so dangerous.
516,00:31:02.54,00:31:02.54,>> I just want to make sure it's not me that goes.
517,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,Really? >> Just play it.
518,00:31:15.33,00:31:15.33,>> Okay. I knew that Amanda was lying to
519,00:31:22.62,00:31:22.62,me when she told me that they were voting for me.
520,00:31:25.21,00:31:25.21,"Like, I know you're trying to get rid of me, but I'll just"
521,00:31:28.04,00:31:28.04,"play along with you right now. It's, like, ""Thanks for looking"
522,00:31:30.54,00:31:30.54,"""out for me (clicks tongue) buddy."""
523,00:31:33.29,00:31:33.29,>> Just to be safe. >> Okay.
524,00:31:39.38,00:31:39.38,">> But, like... >> I just, I don't know what to"
525,00:31:42.96,00:31:42.96,"do because I'm really honestly, Parvati, I'm so confused, like."
526,00:31:45.38,00:31:45.38,">> It's gonna get messy, so I think the best thing that"
527,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,"you could do tonight is just let them vote for me, and just"
528,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,vote with them. Then we'll take it from there.
529,00:31:55.79,00:31:55.79,>> All right. (sighs) My head hurts.
530,00:32:09.46,00:32:09.46,>> It's hard to really know who they're voting for.
531,00:32:11.96,00:32:11.96,"If they say they're voting me out, and I play the idol, then"
532,00:32:14.92,00:32:14.92,"the idol's gone, and it's just risky."
533,00:32:19.29,00:32:19.29,"So damned if you do, damned if you don't."
534,00:32:22.75,00:32:22.75,"Unless, like, you picked the right person."
535,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,I hope. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
536,00:32:45.25,00:32:45.25,the members of our jury. Coach and Courtney voted out
537,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,at the last Tribal Council. >> Whoo-hoo!
538,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,">> PROBST: Rupert, what is camp life like, both Heroes and"
539,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,Villains living in the same spot?
540,00:33:05.42,00:33:05.42,>> (laughs): It is... an adjustment.
541,00:33:08.33,00:33:08.33,"You know, you heard James say the ""banana etiquette"" thing."
542,00:33:11.25,00:33:11.25,I haven't had a ripe banana since... (laughs)
543,00:33:14.29,00:33:14.29,"since they got here. >> With all due respect,"
544,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,there's so many plantains and green bananas that I don't
545,00:33:21.83,00:33:21.83,"think we should be penalized for wanting to cook a plantain,"
546,00:33:24.75,00:33:24.75,considering the plethora amount that we have.
547,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,>> I don't think there's ever been a discussion about eating
548,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,plantains. We have a thousand plantains.
549,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,It's the ripe bananas. We have ripe bananas all the
550,00:33:38.92,00:33:38.92,"time, but we let them ripen. >> But I always feel like I'm"
551,00:33:43.46,00:33:43.46,"walking on eggshells around the camp, because you guys do things"
552,00:33:46.29,00:33:46.29,"your way, we've done them our way, and now we've come"
553,00:33:48.79,00:33:48.79,"together, so we need to work out a way where it works for"
554,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,"everybody. >> I think... I think that, uh,"
555,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,nothing's going to change. There's two separate tribes.
556,00:33:56.75,00:33:56.75,The game is on. Let's forget about the green
557,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,bananas and the yellow bananas or whatever-- so what?
558,00:34:02.42,00:34:02.42,"Let's play the game. >> PROBST: Russell, could"
559,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,tonight's vote dictate the rest of the game?
560,00:34:07.79,00:34:07.79,>> Tonight's vote will dictate the rest of the game.
561,00:34:10.79,00:34:10.79,This is the most important vote that I've ever been a part of.
562,00:34:14.38,00:34:14.38,"If one of the Villains go home, then the Heroes are going to be"
563,00:34:17.42,00:34:17.42,"in the top five. If one of the Heroes go home,"
564,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,the Villains are going to be in the top five.
565,00:34:21.88,00:34:21.88,That's just how it's going to work tonight.
566,00:34:23.54,00:34:23.54,"That's going to happen. >> PROBST: J.T., sound true to"
567,00:34:26.42,00:34:26.42,"you? >> I hope that it's true, and I"
568,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,"hope it's a Villain that goes home, if it is."
569,00:34:31.12,00:34:31.12,">> PROBST: Was it a crazy day at camp, J.T.?"
570,00:34:33.96,00:34:33.96,">> None of these people want to talk to me, so that leads me to"
571,00:34:36.25,00:34:36.25,believe my name's getting wrote down a lot tonight.
572,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,">> I'll talk to you anytime, J.T."
573,00:34:40.12,00:34:40.12,>> My feelings are already hurt. I don't want to hear it.
574,00:34:42.46,00:34:42.46,">> Aw! Maybe mine are hurt, too. >> PROBST: Jerri, can you see"
575,00:34:46.17,00:34:46.17,"what J.T.'s talking about, that you guys were somehow"
576,00:34:49.21,00:34:49.21,avoiding him for some reason? >> It did feel a little bit
577,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,"like they had a wall up, J.T. in particular."
578,00:34:54.21,00:34:54.21,">> Russell, is that maybe just paranoia, that everybody's"
579,00:34:57.50,00:34:57.50,feeling the same thing? >> I think that that's exactly
580,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,"what it is, paranoia. You know, I talk to J.T. all the"
581,00:35:02.92,00:35:02.92,"time, all the time. I've probably been talking to"
582,00:35:05.38,00:35:05.38,"their tribe more than mine. >> PROBST: Sandra, concern you a"
583,00:35:10.50,00:35:10.50,"little, Russell, your Villain tribe mate, is over there making"
584,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,"friends with the Heroes? >> No. I mean, we all want"
585,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,"to get along. I mean, I talk to everyone"
586,00:35:18.75,00:35:18.75,"individually, ""Hey, how you doing, where you from, where"
587,00:35:21.12,00:35:21.12,"you work,"" whatever, but as far as strategy, nobody said"
588,00:35:24.25,00:35:24.25,"nothing to me neither, so I didn't say nothing to them"
589,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,neither. >> I feel like everyone's been
590,00:35:29.08,00:35:29.08,avoiding me. (laughs): I feel like a leper on
591,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,this tribe. I do. >> PROBST: But is that just
592,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,because you're used to getting attention all the time in life?
593,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,"(laughter) >> No, Jeff, but you're right."
594,00:35:39.58,00:35:39.58,But no. I think... I think it's because
595,00:35:43.58,00:35:43.58,"everyone thinks I'm such a threat, and so no one wants to"
596,00:35:46.54,00:35:46.54,be associated with me. >> PROBST: So you believe the
597,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,Heroes have you in their sights tonight?
598,00:35:52.33,00:35:52.33,>> Definitely. >> Or maybe we haven't
599,00:35:55.12,00:35:55.12,approached Parvati yet because we know she's going to be
600,00:35:57.79,00:35:57.79,around for a few more days and we'll have that opportunity.
601,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,"So there's another angle. >> So in other words, the"
602,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,Heroes might be targeting somebody else on the Villains.
603,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,">> Maybe. >> J.T., has there been any"
604,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,talk in your group about who might have any hidden immunity
605,00:36:13.29,00:36:13.29,"idols, if there are any in the game at all?"
606,00:36:15.54,00:36:15.54,>> The idols are a big topic of conversation.
607,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,"It's a mess, and I don't have any idea who might have an idol"
608,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,"or who's got one. I know I don't have one, so I'm"
609,00:36:25.21,00:36:25.21,"pretty worried about it. >> PROBST: Parvati, topic of"
610,00:36:28.38,00:36:28.38,discussion on the Villains' tribe?
611,00:36:30.92,00:36:30.92,">> Yeah, definitely. I mean, we've seen what idols"
612,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,"can do, as far as on the Villain tribe."
613,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,It broke a completely solid alliance and turned the game.
614,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,">> PROBST: Well, I don't think we've had a bigger vote."
615,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,"Danielle, you have the immunity necklace."
616,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,I assume you're keeping it tonight.
617,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,>> Of course. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
618,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,Danielle. Everybody else is fair game.
619,00:36:50.12,00:36:50.12,"It is time to vote. Russell, you're up."
620,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,">> You seem like a real cool guy, but it was a real dumb"
621,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,"move by giving me your idol. And because of that, I gotta"
622,00:37:10.67,00:37:10.67,vote you out tonight. >> This is my love letter to
623,00:37:20.79,00:37:20.79,"you. Since you tried to vote me out,"
624,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,I figured I should return the favor.
625,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,>> Hoping my name doesn't come up tonight.
626,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,>> I hope Parvati plays that idol and shows everybody that
627,00:37:51.38,00:37:51.38,"Russell is a liar. >> Jerri, we're voting for you"
628,00:38:04.88,00:38:04.88,"tonight because if there is an immunity idol, you're the least"
629,00:38:08.21,00:38:08.21,likely person that they would give it to.
630,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
631,00:38:29.33,00:38:29.33,"If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,"
632,00:38:32.75,00:38:32.75,"now would be the time to do so. >> You know what, Jeff?"
633,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,(others groaning) I think it would be downright
634,00:38:44.42,00:38:44.42,depressing to sit and watch green bananas turn yellow
635,00:38:47.46,00:38:47.46,"without my debaucherous little Villains, so..."
636,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,"Sandra, that's for you. >> Get out of here! For real?"
637,00:38:56.25,00:38:56.25,">> Yeah. And, Jeff..."
638,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,I would just like to increase our odds.
639,00:39:09.25,00:39:09.25,"So, Jerri, that one's for you, too."
640,00:39:23.04,00:39:23.04,">> PROBST: Thanks, Jerri, Sandra."
641,00:39:25.62,00:39:25.62,>> Wow! >> PROBST: The rules of Survivor
642,00:39:31.46,00:39:31.46,"state that if anybody plays a hidden immunity idol, then any"
643,00:39:34.25,00:39:34.25,votes cast against that person will not count.
644,00:39:36.75,00:39:36.75,These are both hidden immunity idols.
645,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,Any votes cast for Sandra or Jerri will not count.
646,00:39:45.21,00:39:45.21,I'll read the votes. First vote...
647,00:39:54.12,00:39:54.12,Jerri. Does not count.
648,00:40:02.42,00:40:02.42,Jerri. Does not count.
649,00:40:08.12,00:40:08.12,Jerri. Does not count.
650,00:40:13.17,00:40:13.17,Jerri. Does not count.
651,00:40:17.29,00:40:17.29,Jerri. Does not count.
652,00:40:23.42,00:40:23.42,J.T. One vote J.T.
653,00:40:32.25,00:40:32.25,J.T. That's two votes J.T.
654,00:40:39.04,00:40:39.04,11th person voted out and the third member of our jury...
655,00:40:42.50,00:40:42.50,"J.T. That's three, and tonight"
656,00:40:44.54,00:40:44.54,"that's enough. J.T., the tribe has spoken."
657,00:40:57.17,00:40:57.17,"Time for you to go. >> Good luck, fellas."
658,00:41:07.12,00:41:07.12,">> PROBST: Well, in a game full of crazy moves, that was one of"
659,00:41:11.17,00:41:11.17,"the craziest. With tonight's vote, it"
660,00:41:13.79,00:41:13.79,"certainly appears that the Villains have the upper hand,"
661,00:41:16.21,00:41:16.21,but you know better than anybody-- anything can and
662,00:41:19.08,00:41:19.08,probably will still happen in this game.
663,00:41:22.25,00:41:22.25,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
664,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
665,00:41:39.50,00:41:39.50,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
666,00:41:45.71,00:41:45.71,"Survivor... >> Whatever, whatever."
667,00:41:47.54,00:41:47.54,>> PROBST: As Russell loses control of his alliance...
668,00:41:50.08,00:41:50.08,>> You lied to me. >> How did I lie to you?
669,00:41:52.12,00:41:52.12,>> PROBST: ... Sandra takes control of the game.
670,00:41:54.04,00:41:54.04,>> They're done. So you want Russell gone?
671,00:41:56.08,00:41:56.08,>> Yeah. >> Russell's gone.
672,00:41:57.67,00:41:57.67,My target is Russell. I've been waiting to take him
673,00:42:00.38,00:42:00.38,"down for 30 days. >> Yeah, I trust you."
674,00:42:02.75,00:42:02.75,(Sandra laughs) >> I feel like a total idiot
675,00:42:10.29,00:42:10.29,right now. It's pretty terrible to be
676,00:42:12.88,00:42:12.88,voted out by your own idol. I felt like Russell would vote
677,00:42:15.88,00:42:15.88,the way we told him to vote. People are Villains for a
678,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,"reason-- don't ever trust them. Worse than that, don't ever"
679,00:42:22.04,00:42:22.04,"trust women, ever, ever, ever. You can't always win."
680,00:42:25.50,00:42:25.50,"It was a big move, do or die, and I died tonight."
