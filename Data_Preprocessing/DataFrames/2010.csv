192,00:10:35.17,00:10:35.17,Everybody else voted forCourtney.
193,00:10:38.38,00:10:38.38,This is where I stand.This is it for me.
194,00:10:41.08,00:10:41.08,So don't even have any doubt.>> I don't doubt you.
195,00:10:43.08,00:10:43.08,I don't doubt you.>> Don't have any...
196,00:10:45.08,00:10:45.08,Don't even worry.>> Just let this happen.
197,00:10:51.62,00:10:51.62,>> That's right.>> Just breathe.
198,00:10:53.62,00:10:53.62,>> Breathe.>> Breathe.
199,00:10:55.62,00:10:55.62,>> That's exactly right.>> Yeah.
200,00:11:05.92,00:11:05.92,>> Giving Russell the hiddenimmunity idol could blow up in
201,00:11:07.83,00:11:07.83,"my face.I mean, he could have never been"
202,00:11:09.96,00:11:09.96,"going home.You know, he could be the leader"
203,00:11:12.21,00:11:12.21,of the girls over there.Do I believe it?
204,00:11:14.25,00:11:14.25,"Not a chance in the world.So I mean, I trust him"
205,00:11:17.12,00:11:17.12,explicitly.>> Exactly right.
206,00:11:24.71,00:11:24.71,">> Hook, line, and sinker.They're biting everything I tell"
207,00:11:28.92,00:11:28.92,them.This is going to be way easier
208,00:11:31.92,00:11:31.92,than I thought.>> You're darn right.
209,00:11:36.17,00:11:36.17,>> That's right.>> That's good.
210,00:11:40.17,00:11:40.17,It's going to be a wonderfulthing.
211,00:11:55.46,00:11:55.46,>> You know how some peopleforgive but don't forget?
212,00:11:58.46,00:11:58.46,"Well, I don't forgive and Idon't forget."
213,00:12:00.75,00:12:00.75,The Heroes don't know thatRussell is the kingpin and that
214,00:12:05.25,00:12:05.25,Parvati's his right-hand man.Russell's trying to play up this
215,00:12:08.54,00:12:08.54,thing like all these women areabout to get rid of him.
216,00:12:12.33,00:12:12.33,I hope I get my revenge 'causeit's going to be good.
217,00:12:15.58,00:12:15.58,>> So what happened last night?>> Courtney's the last person
218,00:12:18.79,00:12:18.79,from my alliance.They didn't want me and Courtney
219,00:12:20.46,00:12:20.46,over here together.That's why Courtney had to go.
220,00:12:23.25,00:12:23.25,"I'm the last one standing and Ihave to be babysat, and if they"
221,00:12:26.12,00:12:26.12,"catch me talking, I'm gone next.You guys are done, starting with"
222,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,the men.You better-- I got to-- I got to
223,00:12:35.54,00:12:35.54,keep you on the low-low.I'll tell you on the low-low.
224,00:12:37.17,00:12:37.17,>> Right.Okay.
225,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,">> But whatever Russell says,agree to it, but he's lying if"
226,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,he says that the women arerunning the show.
227,00:12:44.58,00:12:44.58,>> Got you.Sandra just gave me some really
228,00:12:47.08,00:12:47.08,good information.Russell told us that Parvati
229,00:12:53.42,00:12:53.42,used her immunity idol lastnight.
230,00:12:56.50,00:12:56.50,That is not true.I don't know if we're getting
231,00:13:00.75,00:13:00.75,"played or not, but Russell mightbe running the show, and if"
232,00:13:06.33,00:13:06.33,Sandra is true-- and I have tobelieve Sandra-- Russell is
233,00:13:11.21,00:13:11.21,playing us.Boy.
234,00:13:16.04,00:13:16.04,This is where the game getscrazy.
235,00:13:28.29,00:13:28.29,">> All right, now scramble thatjoker up or them eggs are"
236,00:13:31.25,00:13:31.25,gonna be brown on the bottom.>> Do you guys want your egg
237,00:13:33.92,00:13:33.92,"boiled or scrambled?>> Oh, I don't care."
238,00:13:37.00,00:13:37.00,">> Um, whatever you guys do.>> Okay. Just asked"
239,00:13:39.08,00:13:39.08,if you cared.>> Whatever you have.
240,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,"Whatever you're inspired tomake, I'll eat it."
241,00:13:43.04,00:13:43.04,>> Okay. (both chuckle)>> The egg is really good.
242,00:13:51.67,00:13:51.67,>> That is a damn goodbreakfast.
243,00:13:54.04,00:13:54.04,>> Yup.>> I'm gonna find a banana.
244,00:13:59.75,00:13:59.75,">> Oh, yeah.>> Oh, my God, it's like"
245,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,all I need.You're not hungry?
246,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,">> Y'all still got breakfast onme, don't ya?"
247,00:14:06.88,00:14:06.88,>> We just ate.>> Why do they want to
248,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,eat again?They can't be eating all
249,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,their food.>> Look at this one. (chuckles)
250,00:14:17.38,00:14:17.38,">> They're the greedy-ass,eating-ass, pain-in-the-ass"
251,00:14:20.08,00:14:20.08,"tribe.In our Hero tribe, coconuts are"
252,00:14:25.42,00:14:25.42,aplenty.Anyone can open any coconuts
253,00:14:29.42,00:14:29.42,they want.With the other food: the bananas
254,00:14:32.38,00:14:32.38,"the papayas, we divide that upa hundred-percent even."
255,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,I cannot wait to start votingsome of these Villains out of
256,00:14:42.88,00:14:42.88,our camp.>> That's more than I eat
257,00:14:46.33,00:14:46.33,in three days.>> I'm already tired of 'em.
258,00:14:50.21,00:14:50.21,>> Not very good.>> And they've only been here
259,00:14:52.17,00:14:52.17,two days.>> This one might be.
260,00:14:53.83,00:14:53.83,It's rotten.>> Alls I'm saying you got
261,00:14:57.96,00:14:57.96,to watch 'em.You got to watch all of them.
262,00:15:00.21,00:15:00.21,If Russell is playing us...>> He's not.
263,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,>> Now listen to me.Don't be so quick.
264,00:15:06.17,00:15:06.17,"Let me just tell you thescenario, okay?"
265,00:15:08.21,00:15:08.21,"If Russell didn't use that damnimmunity idol, and he's got all"
266,00:15:11.25,00:15:11.25,"of us voting for Parvati, thosefour can put one of us out."
267,00:15:15.08,00:15:15.08,>> But I'm telling you Parvatiwouldn't be in this game if she
268,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,didn't play her idol.No question. I asked.
269,00:15:20.08,00:15:20.08,I believe that.>> I don't think so either.
270,00:15:22.25,00:15:22.25,>> You have faith in Russell.Don't trust him.
271,00:15:24.04,00:15:24.04,He's on the Villain sidefor a reason!
272,00:15:26.50,00:15:26.50,J.T. believes wholeheartedlythat Russell is on our side
273,00:15:30.46,00:15:30.46,and indebted to us now.I don't.
274,00:15:34.92,00:15:34.92,So we might just plan onchanging our five votes just
275,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,before we go in there;whoever Russell says.
276,00:15:40.04,00:15:40.04,">> Yep.>> We don't put that person, but"
277,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,"we look right at him and say,""Okay. Stay the course."""
278,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,">> Yeah, we will do whatever ittakes, the first vote."
279,00:15:46.17,00:15:46.17,">> We're together to the end,brother, to the end."
280,00:15:48.12,00:15:48.12,">> We're good.> All right, this is,"
281,00:15:49.58,00:15:49.58,this is...>> Rupert is really skeptical of
282,00:15:52.75,00:15:52.75,"Russell, so just to make sureRupert's okay, the Heroes are"
283,00:15:56.00,00:15:56.00,"gonna tell Russell we're votingfor someone, and then the five"
284,00:15:58.62,00:15:58.62,of us are gonna vote forsomeone else.
285,00:16:00.50,00:16:00.50,So it's good just to test.We don't want to make a dumb
286,00:16:03.33,00:16:03.33,"decision, and then be, you know,lose our lead."
287,00:16:06.79,00:16:06.79,That would be awful.You're getting paranoid.
288,00:16:09.08,00:16:09.08,">> You are. You're sweating,you're scaring yourself into"
289,00:16:12.00,00:16:12.00,a panic out here.You're not pulling...
290,00:16:14.29,00:16:14.29,>> I-I just want to make sureone of us... Fine.
291,00:16:18.25,00:16:18.25,>> Rupert-- (laughs) there's areason that I've been doings a
292,00:16:20.58,00:16:20.58,Rupert strategical play forhim thus far because he needs
293,00:16:24.12,00:16:24.12,"to be told where to vote bysomeone he can really trust,"
294,00:16:27.46,00:16:27.46,and let that be done.So I just keep reminding him
295,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33,"of that, like, ""Rupert, think""about this a minute."
296,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,"""Do you believe what Sandra""told you or do you believe"
297,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,the obvious truth?I mean...
298,00:16:41.17,00:16:41.17,">> It's, it's smelling fishy.>> If Sandra's story turns out"
299,00:16:46.46,00:16:46.46,"be true, and Russell did notplay the idol, then that means"
300,00:16:50.96,00:16:50.96,I'm probably going home thenext Tribal Council.
301,00:16:53.21,00:16:53.21,I don't know.Do I believe it?
302,00:16:54.79,00:16:54.79,Not a chance in the world.But you never know in this game.
303,00:16:57.92,00:16:57.92,>> Russell looked me right inthe eye and swore on his kid's
304,00:17:00.29,00:17:00.29,"life that he was with us.And anybody that will do that,"
305,00:17:05.25,00:17:05.25,right away I don't trust 'em.>> Okay.
306,00:17:08.38,00:17:08.38,">> Okay, then don'ttrust Russell."
307,00:17:41.25,00:17:41.25,>> About you?>> About you.
308,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,>> They're gonna try tovote me out.
309,00:17:44.75,00:17:44.75,">> Yeah, they want you gone.Like, that's why I don't know"
310,00:17:47.33,00:17:47.33,"what to do 'cause it's weird,Parvati."
311,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,"Like, I have no power over here.Like, everyone's freaked out"
312,00:17:52.29,00:17:52.29,about you.>> I don't know. I just...
313,00:17:56.42,00:17:56.42,"So if I don't win today, thenthey're voting for me?"
314,00:17:59.29,00:17:59.29,>> Probably.>> And Russell with probably
315,00:18:01.04,00:18:01.04,vote with them.>> To get with Sandra?
316,00:18:07.00,00:18:07.00,>> Rid of Sandra.>> Amanda and I got a chance to
317,00:18:15.62,00:18:15.62,"talk for the first time sincetothe merge, and I think I got"
318,00:18:19.83,00:18:19.83,probably half her story.So I haven't decided the best
319,00:18:22.54,00:18:22.54,"plan yet because with her, Idon't know if she's telling me"
320,00:18:26.88,00:18:26.88,the truth or not.Will you tell me who everyone's
321,00:18:30.96,00:18:30.96,voting for?>> Yeah.
322,00:18:31.96,00:18:31.96,">> Just at least tell me.>> No, I will."
323,00:18:34.04,00:18:34.04,>> Okay. Do you swear you'regonna be really honest with me?
324,00:18:36.25,00:18:36.25,">> Yes, I have been.I told you all that stuff."
325,00:18:38.71,00:18:38.71,">> Okay, so then I have totell you something."
326,00:18:41.50,00:18:41.50,>> Okay.>> You have another one?
327,00:18:45.54,00:18:45.54,>> Yeah.>> How did you get another one?
328,00:18:47.29,00:18:47.29,>> I'm crafty. (laughs)>> Love it. Loving it.
329,00:18:50.88,00:18:50.88,I had a conversation withParvati.
330,00:18:52.29,00:18:52.29,"I didn't tell her everything,but I told her enough to get"
331,00:18:55.08,00:18:55.08,"her to trust me, and she told methat she had the idol."
332,00:18:58.71,00:18:58.71,"And I like Parvati andeverything, but she makes it to"
333,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"the end of this game, she'sgonna win again."
334,00:19:03.46,00:19:03.46,">> If we're working together,then we're working together"
335,00:19:05.42,00:19:05.42,"and I trust you.However the vote shakes down,"
336,00:19:11.04,00:19:11.04,"I'm gonna make sure my butt issafe, no matter what."
337,00:19:14.08,00:19:14.08,But I'm gonna try to make itwork that none of our Villains
338,00:19:19.17,00:19:19.17,are going anywhere tonight.>> But you trust me?
339,00:19:21.92,00:19:21.92,>> I trust you.>> I trust you.
340,00:19:23.33,00:19:23.33,Should we do a secret handshake?>> Yeah.
341,00:19:26.08,00:19:26.08,>> Blow it up.(both laugh)

343,00:19:49.54,00:19:49.54,"What's the new tribe name?>> Uh, Yin Yang."

350,00:20:15.33,00:20:15.33,"For today's challenge, it'svery simple."

433,00:25:49.25,00:25:49.25,lasted the longest.You're the odds-on favorite

435,00:25:55.12,00:25:55.12,just going to bow out of thechallenge.
436,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,>> They look like they could gofor a while.
437,00:26:00.92,00:26:00.92,It's true.>> PROBST: Step out.
438,00:26:04.17,00:26:04.17,"And with that, Candice steps offthe post and is out of"
439,00:26:07.29,00:26:07.29,"the challenge.>> Good job, Candice."

456,00:27:05.62,00:27:05.62,out who it's gonna be.Head back to camp.
457,00:27:07.58,00:27:07.58,I'll see you at Tribal.Congratulations.
458,00:27:09.92,00:27:09.92,>> Yes!>> I think Parvati is gonna come
459,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,up with a hidden immunity idoltonight.
460,00:27:14.62,00:27:14.62,"But Parvati wouldn't have walkedoff that pole, but I don't know."
461,00:27:18.25,00:27:18.25,That's all part of the plantonight; to see if I can oust
462,00:27:21.50,00:27:21.50,Russell for the weasel thathe is.
463,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,>> It's kinda strange howParvati stepped down at the end
464,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"of the challenge, you know?And she's in such danger and she"
465,00:27:47.75,00:27:47.75,"knows it.So the plans are, tonight,"
466,00:27:51.21,00:27:51.21,the Heroes are gonnalet Russell write Parvati's name
467,00:27:53.42,00:27:53.42,down just to prove his loyaltyto all of of us.
468,00:27:57.38,00:27:57.38,"Me and Candice and Rupert,Amanda, Colby-- five strong--"
469,00:28:02.71,00:28:02.71,will write down Sandra orJerri's name.
470,00:28:11.58,00:28:11.58,">> Right, yeah.>> Sandra?"
471,00:28:16.88,00:28:16.88,Jerri done a hell of a lotbetter than Sandra did.
472,00:28:29.38,00:28:29.38,>> I don't even carewho goes home.
473,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,>> I don't either as long asit's not me.
474,00:28:33.29,00:28:33.29,">> As long as it ain't us.When we come back tonight,"
475,00:28:36.25,00:28:36.25,"they'll be real mad, like, ""Whatin the hell just happened?"""
476,00:28:39.04,00:28:39.04,>> They think that they got thisin the bag.
477,00:28:40.88,00:28:40.88,Which tells me that Russell'sdoing a good job of convincing
478,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,"them.>> When I first got here, I"
479,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,tried to tell Rupert thatRussell is running this
480,00:28:50.83,00:28:50.83,"whole show.And anyway, we talked really,"
481,00:28:53.00,00:28:53.00,"really quick, and that was it.I don't want my big mouth"
482,00:28:59.96,00:28:59.96,to get me in trouble.I still want Russell out bad.
483,00:29:04.75,00:29:04.75,But right now I'm stuckwith Russell.
484,00:29:09.54,00:29:09.54,I'm stuck with Russell.>> My plan A is to give the idol
485,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,"to Parvati, save herself,and vote out J.T."
486,00:29:23.38,00:29:23.38,I don't have a plan B.But I hope for the second time
487,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,I'm gonna save her with aimmunity idol.
488,00:29:29.38,00:29:29.38,"I have a gift for you.If it was just me, it'd be just"
489,00:29:33.25,00:29:33.25,"me, but I got to keep thesefour girls on my Villain tribe"
490,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,"so I can get rid of J.T.>> Oh, you!"
491,00:29:40.92,00:29:40.92,You shouldn't have!>> There you go.
492,00:29:44.62,00:29:44.62,"(Parvati laughs)Thanks, honey. (chuckles)"
493,00:29:47.50,00:29:47.50,Russell just gave me hisimmunity idol.
494,00:29:49.46,00:29:49.46,So that makes me safe forfor tonight.
495,00:29:53.00,00:29:53.00,And I have my own immunityidol.
496,00:29:59.42,00:29:59.42,That also makes me safefor the rest of the game.
497,00:30:03.08,00:30:03.08,It's like two little green menprotecting me.
498,00:30:06.00,00:30:06.00,"And apparently everyone elsein this game is, like, desperate"
499,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,to get rid of me.And they said that I'm the most
500,00:30:12.21,00:30:12.21,dangerous player out here.So I don't know.
501,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,I guess they're right.I didn't really think they were
502,00:30:16.67,00:30:16.67,right until right now.Now I really think they're
503,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,right. (chuckles)>> What? Being on
504,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,separate tribes?>> Yeah.
505,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,>> I know.>> Because I honestly don't know
506,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"what to do.I want to play with you, but I"
507,00:30:38.42,00:30:38.42,don't see how we're gonnaplay together.
508,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,So the idea is to haveParvati play her idol and
509,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,vote out Sandra or Jerri.It'll be really crazy tonight if
510,00:30:48.38,00:30:48.38,Parvati gives her idol toto somebody.
511,00:30:50.08,00:30:50.08,I hope she doesn't.I hope she plays it for herself
512,00:30:52.62,00:30:52.62,"just so...I mean, it's always good."
513,00:30:55.96,00:30:55.96,You never want idols floatingaround.
514,00:30:58.29,00:30:58.29,It just ruins things.She's so dangerous.
515,00:31:02.54,00:31:02.54,>> I just want to make sureit's not me that goes.
516,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,Really?>> Just play it.
517,00:31:15.33,00:31:15.33,>> Okay.I knew that Amanda was lying to
518,00:31:22.62,00:31:22.62,me when she told me that theywere voting for me.
519,00:31:25.21,00:31:25.21,"Like, I know you're trying toget rid of me, but I'll just"
520,00:31:28.04,00:31:28.04,"play along with you right now.It's, like, ""Thanks for looking"
521,00:31:30.54,00:31:30.54,"""out for me (clicks tongue)buddy."""
522,00:31:33.29,00:31:33.29,>> Just to be safe.>> Okay.
523,00:31:39.38,00:31:39.38,">> But, like...>> I just, I don't know what to"
524,00:31:42.96,00:31:42.96,"do because I'm really honestly,Parvati, I'm so confused, like."
525,00:31:45.38,00:31:45.38,">> It's gonna get messy,so I think the best thing that"
526,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,"you could do tonight is justlet them vote for me, and just"
527,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,vote with them.Then we'll take it from there.
528,00:31:55.79,00:31:55.79,>> All right. (sighs)My head hurts.
529,00:32:09.46,00:32:09.46,>> It's hard to really know whothey're voting for.
530,00:32:11.96,00:32:11.96,"If they say they're voting meout, and I play the idol, then"
531,00:32:14.92,00:32:14.92,"the idol's gone, and it'sjust risky."
532,00:32:19.29,00:32:19.29,"So damned if you do,damned if you don't."
533,00:32:22.75,00:32:22.75,"Unless, like, you pickedthe right person."
534,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,I hope.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
535,00:32:45.25,00:32:45.25,the members of our jury.Coach and Courtney voted out
536,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,at the last Tribal Council.>> Whoo-hoo!
537,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,">> PROBST: Rupert, what is camplife like, both Heroes and"
538,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,Villains living in thesame spot?
539,00:33:05.42,00:33:05.42,>> (laughs): It is...an adjustment.
540,00:33:08.33,00:33:08.33,"You know, you heard James saythe ""banana etiquette"" thing."
541,00:33:11.25,00:33:11.25,I haven't had a ripe bananasince... (laughs)
542,00:33:14.29,00:33:14.29,"since they got here.>> With all due respect,"
543,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,there's so many plantains andgreen bananas that I don't
544,00:33:21.83,00:33:21.83,"think we should be penalizedfor wanting to cook a plantain,"
545,00:33:24.75,00:33:24.75,considering the plethora amountthat we have.
546,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,>> I don't think there's everbeen a discussion about eating
547,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,plantains.We have a thousand plantains.
548,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,It's the ripe bananas.We have ripe bananas all the
549,00:33:38.92,00:33:38.92,"time, but we let them ripen.>> But I always feel like I'm"
550,00:33:43.46,00:33:43.46,"walking on eggshells around thecamp, because you guys do things"
551,00:33:46.29,00:33:46.29,"your way, we've done them ourway, and now we've come"
552,00:33:48.79,00:33:48.79,"together, so we need to work outa way where it works for"
553,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,"everybody.>> I think... I think that, uh,"
554,00:33:53.04,00:33:53.04,nothing's going to change.There's two separate tribes.
555,00:33:56.75,00:33:56.75,The game is on.Let's forget about the green
556,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,bananas and the yellow bananasor whatever-- so what?
557,00:34:02.42,00:34:02.42,"Let's play the game.>> PROBST: Russell, could"
558,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,tonight's vote dictate the restof the game?
559,00:34:07.79,00:34:07.79,>> Tonight's vote will dictatethe rest of the game.
560,00:34:10.79,00:34:10.79,This is the most important votethat I've ever been a part of.
561,00:34:14.38,00:34:14.38,"If one of the Villains go home,then the Heroes are going to be"
562,00:34:17.42,00:34:17.42,"in the top five.If one of the Heroes go home,"

569,00:34:33.96,00:34:33.96,">> None of these people want totalk to me, so that leads me to"
570,00:34:36.25,00:34:36.25,believe my name's gettingwrote down a lot tonight.
571,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,">> I'll talk to you anytime,J.T."
572,00:34:40.12,00:34:40.12,>> My feelings are already hurt.I don't want to hear it.

576,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,"like they had a wall up, J.T.in particular."
577,00:34:54.21,00:34:54.21,">> Russell, is that maybe justparanoia, that everybody's"
578,00:34:57.50,00:34:57.50,feeling the same thing?>> I think that that's exactly
579,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,"what it is, paranoia.You know, I talk to J.T. all the"
580,00:35:02.92,00:35:02.92,"time, all the time.I've probably been talking to"
581,00:35:05.38,00:35:05.38,"their tribe more than mine.>> PROBST: Sandra, concern you a"

590,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,this tribe. I do.>> PROBST: But is that just
591,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,because you're used to gettingattention all the time in life?
592,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,"(laughter)>> No, Jeff, but you're right."
593,00:35:39.58,00:35:39.58,But no.I think... I think it's because
594,00:35:43.58,00:35:43.58,"everyone thinks I'm such athreat, and so no one wants to"
595,00:35:46.54,00:35:46.54,be associated with me.>> PROBST: So you believe the

597,00:35:52.33,00:35:52.33,>> Definitely.>> Or maybe we haven't
598,00:35:55.12,00:35:55.12,approached Parvati yet becausewe know she's going to be
599,00:35:57.79,00:35:57.79,around for a few more days andwe'll have that opportunity.
600,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,"So there's another angle.>> So in other words, the"
601,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,Heroes might be targetingsomebody else on the Villains.
602,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,">> Maybe.>> J.T., has there been any"
603,00:36:10.00,00:36:10.00,talk in your group about whomight have any hidden immunity
604,00:36:13.29,00:36:13.29,"idols, if there are any in thegame at all?"
605,00:36:15.54,00:36:15.54,>> The idols are a big topic ofconversation.
606,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,"It's a mess, and I don't haveany idea who might have an idol"
607,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,"or who's got one.I know I don't have one, so I'm"
608,00:36:25.21,00:36:25.21,"pretty worried about it.>> PROBST: Parvati, topic of"
609,00:36:28.38,00:36:28.38,discussion on the Villains'tribe?
610,00:36:30.92,00:36:30.92,">> Yeah, definitely.I mean, we've seen what idols"
611,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,"can do, as far as on theVillain tribe."
612,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,It broke a completely solidalliance and turned the game.
613,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,">> PROBST: Well, I don't thinkwe've had a bigger vote."
614,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,"Danielle, you have the immunitynecklace."
615,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,I assume you're keeping ittonight.
616,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,>> Of course.>> PROBST: You cannot vote for
617,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,Danielle.Everybody else is fair game.

619,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,">> You seem like a real coolguy, but it was a real dumb"
620,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,"move by giving me your idol.And because of that, I gotta"
621,00:37:10.67,00:37:10.67,vote you out tonight.>> This is my love letter to
622,00:37:20.79,00:37:20.79,"you.Since you tried to vote me out,"
623,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,I figured I should return thefavor.
624,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,>> Hoping my name doesn't comeup tonight.
625,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,>> I hope Parvati plays thatidol and shows everybody that
626,00:37:51.38,00:37:51.38,"Russell is a liar.>> Jerri, we're voting for you"
627,00:38:04.88,00:38:04.88,"tonight because if there is animmunity idol, you're the least"
628,00:38:08.21,00:38:08.21,likely person that they wouldgive it to.
629,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
630,00:38:29.33,00:38:29.33,"If anybody has a hidden immunityidol and you want to play it,"
631,00:38:32.75,00:38:32.75,"now would be the time to do so.>> You know what, Jeff?"
632,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,(others groaning)I think it would be downright
633,00:38:44.42,00:38:44.42,depressing to sit and watchgreen bananas turn yellow
634,00:38:47.46,00:38:47.46,"without my debaucherous littleVillains, so..."
635,00:38:52.67,00:38:52.67,"Sandra, that's for you.>> Get out of here! For real?"
636,00:38:56.25,00:38:56.25,">> Yeah.And, Jeff..."
637,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,I would just like to increaseour odds.
638,00:39:09.25,00:39:09.25,"So, Jerri, that one's for you,too."
639,00:39:23.04,00:39:23.04,">> PROBST: Thanks, Jerri,Sandra."
640,00:39:25.62,00:39:25.62,>> Wow!>> PROBST: The rules of Survivor

642,00:39:34.25,00:39:34.25,votes cast against that personwill not count.
643,00:39:36.75,00:39:36.75,These are both hidden immunityidols.
644,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,Any votes cast for Sandra orJerri will not count.
645,00:39:45.21,00:39:45.21,I'll read the votes.First vote...

655,00:40:44.54,00:40:44.54,"that's enough.J.T., the tribe has spoken."
656,00:40:57.17,00:40:57.17,"Time for you to go.>> Good luck, fellas."
657,00:41:07.12,00:41:07.12,">> PROBST: Well, in a game fullof crazy moves, that was one of"
658,00:41:11.17,00:41:11.17,"the craziest.With tonight's vote, it"
659,00:41:13.79,00:41:13.79,"certainly appears that theVillains have the upper hand,"
660,00:41:16.21,00:41:16.21,but you know better thananybody-- anything can and
661,00:41:19.08,00:41:19.08,probably will still happen inthis game.
662,00:41:22.25,00:41:22.25,Grab your torches.Head back to camp.
663,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,Good night.>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

671,00:41:57.67,00:41:57.67,My target is Russell.I've been waiting to take him

673,00:42:02.75,00:42:02.75,(Sandra laughs)>> I feel like a total idiot
674,00:42:10.29,00:42:10.29,right now.It's pretty terrible to be
675,00:42:12.88,00:42:12.88,voted out by your own idol.I felt like Russell would vote
676,00:42:15.88,00:42:15.88,the way we told him to vote.People are Villains for a
677,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,"reason-- don't ever trust them.Worse than that, don't ever"
678,00:42:22.04,00:42:22.04,"trust women, ever, ever, ever.You can't always win."
679,00:42:25.50,00:42:25.50,"It was a big move, do or die,and I died tonight."
