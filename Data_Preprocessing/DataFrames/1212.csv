59,00:03:04.08,00:03:04.08,because I got to skip a challenge.

61,00:03:09.08,00:03:09.08,I've got to take. It is really imperative to try

82,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,Here's how it works. You'll be divided into two
83,00:05:11.08,00:05:11.08,teams of three. Each of you will be attached to
84,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,one long rope which runs the length of an obstacle course.
85,00:05:17.88,00:05:17.88,"On my go, you must follow the rope while navigating the"
86,00:05:21.62,00:05:21.62,various obstacles. When you reach the final

88,00:05:29.04,00:05:29.04,lily pad run. You'll then jump into the water
89,00:05:32.12,00:05:32.12,and retrieve a bag. There are three bags total.
90,00:05:35.92,00:05:35.92,"Once you have all three bags, clip back into the rope and"
91,00:05:39.21,00:05:39.21,make your way back across all the same obstacles to the
92,00:05:42.12,00:05:42.12,finish. First team to get to the finish

105,00:06:23.04,00:06:23.04,Strategy is going to be key in this.
106,00:06:25.96,00:06:25.96,>> Help me up. >> PROBST: Aras helping Cirie
107,00:06:28.25,00:06:28.25,over. She takes a hard fall right

115,00:06:57.21,00:06:57.21,Now it's going to get a little tougher having to crawl under
116,00:06:59.62,00:06:59.62,and over. Cirie back into the water.
117,00:07:09.17,00:07:09.17,">> All right, back up. Aras trying to help Cirie."

194,00:12:37.12,00:12:37.12,Either one could win this challenge on this shot.
195,00:12:42.92,00:12:42.92,"Ready, aim, fire. Danielle just misses."
196,00:12:48.42,00:12:48.42,"Courtney just misses. >> Yes, yes, yes!"
197,00:12:52.67,00:12:52.67,>> PROBST: Terry gets it! Terry wins the GMC Yukon.
198,00:12:56.38,00:12:56.38,>> Unbelievable. >> PROBST: Here's how it's
199,00:12:58.04,00:12:58.04,going to work. You're going to fly to an
200,00:13:00.00,00:13:00.00,"island. When you land, your car will be"
201,00:13:02.04,00:13:02.04,waiting for you. It will be loaded with
202,00:13:04.21,00:13:04.21,everything you need for your barbecue.
203,00:13:05.88,00:13:05.88,">> All right, all right. >> PROBST: You'll return to camp"
204,00:13:07.71,00:13:07.71,back later today. >> Excellent.
205,00:13:09.92,00:13:09.92,>> PROBST: Grab your stuff and head on out.
206,00:13:11.46,00:13:11.46,">> All right, let's go barbecue! >> At this point in the game,"
207,00:13:33.42,00:13:33.42,"from what I understand, the idol's not here anymore."
208,00:13:36.92,00:13:36.92,"It's been found, and now it's hiding somewhere in Terry's bag."
209,00:13:40.33,00:13:40.33,And so I won't really waste any of my energy looking for it or
210,00:13:43.79,00:13:43.79,stressing about it because that part of the game is now out of
211,00:13:46.58,00:13:46.58,my control. Kind of makes my stay here
212,00:13:51.83,00:13:51.83,pretty unnecessary in terms of the positives.
213,00:14:05.46,00:14:05.46,>> We were airplaned off to a far island where we were to
214,00:14:09.54,00:14:09.54,"have our feast. >> Oh, it's gorgeous!"
215,00:14:15.42,00:14:15.42,">> Oh, my God! >> At the end of the runway,"
216,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,"there in front of us was a brand-new, spankin' Yukon, and"
217,00:14:22.38,00:14:22.38,"it was righteous, man. >> Wow!"
218,00:14:26.75,00:14:26.75,"Oh, mother of... >> This is gorgeous."
219,00:14:31.00,00:14:31.00,">> The last thing my wife said going out the door was, ""Damn"
220,00:14:33.67,00:14:33.67,"it, just bring me home a car."" Let's see what this bad boy can"
221,00:14:39.79,00:14:39.79,"do. In pile the girls, and off we"
222,00:14:42.33,00:14:42.33,drove to this beach feast. Oh!
223,00:14:53.92,00:14:53.92,">> This is so nice to, like, be on the winning side of things."
224,00:14:59.33,00:14:59.33,"That's like, seriously, like, was, like, the dream team."
225,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,">> Salud! Congratulations, Terry."
226,00:15:04.88,00:15:04.88,>> Thank you. >> I would do anything to get
227,00:15:10.67,00:15:10.67,us to a final three. >> I'm 100% behind you.
228,00:15:15.04,00:15:15.04,"I mean, that's a great final three, wouldn't you say?"
229,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,>> I'm going to start putting out some feelers to Courtney
230,00:15:21.21,00:15:21.21,"and Danielle today, try to forge a relationship with those"
231,00:15:23.29,00:15:23.29,guys in order to take us to the final three.
232,00:15:26.29,00:15:26.29,">> The thing is, if you just win the next immunity challenge"
233,00:15:29.12,00:15:29.12,"and take Aras out, and the next one, one of us will win, and we"
234,00:15:31.58,00:15:31.58,take Shane out... >> Shane out.
235,00:15:33.08,00:15:33.08,">> ...and boom, we're final four, done."
236,00:15:35.25,00:15:35.25,It's been in the back of my mind to join up with Terry for
237,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,like a long time because going against Terry is one pretty
238,00:15:42.50,00:15:42.50,good shot of actually winning the million in the final two.
239,00:15:46.88,00:15:46.88,I think that's kind of how people are looking right now is
240,00:15:49.29,00:15:49.29,who do you want to be up against in the final two?
241,00:15:53.88,00:15:53.88,">> Well, D, I was talking to Courtney while you were gone."
242,00:15:57.83,00:15:57.83,"You know, we talked kind of like the dream final three,"
243,00:16:00.50,00:16:00.50,"final four, whatever. And if you were with us, and"
244,00:16:03.88,00:16:03.88,"it was us three and Cirie, you would have a 75% chance of"
245,00:16:08.54,00:16:08.54,"winning immunity, and that would be pitting us three up"
246,00:16:11.96,00:16:11.96,against Cirie. If I can produce the hidden
247,00:16:14.92,00:16:14.92,"immunity idol, then, you know, even so, we've got three people."
248,00:16:19.46,00:16:19.46,We'd have to beat Cirie. >> Uh-huh.
249,00:16:22.42,00:16:22.42,Terry brought up the fact that his ideal four would be the
250,00:16:25.04,00:16:25.04,"three girls and him, and that's just a given."
251,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,"I mean, obviously, he wants Aras out."
252,00:16:31.21,00:16:31.21,"For his sake. I like that idea, but he's"
253,00:16:35.25,00:16:35.25,"going to have to change up his strategy a little bit, too."
254,00:16:37.83,00:16:37.83,I'm not going to make this so easy for him to win.
255,00:16:49.92,00:16:49.92,">> It's just the two of us, and we can talk about strategy all"
256,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,"we want. We're through to the five,"
257,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,right? >> Right.
258,00:16:59.83,00:16:59.83,">> If Terry wins immunity, me, you, and Aras are still"
259,00:17:02.08,00:17:02.08,"through, because we're going to vote off Danielle."
260,00:17:04.33,00:17:04.33,>> But then there's still Courtney.
261,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"It will be me, you, and Courtney."
262,00:17:10.92,00:17:10.92,Right. Mm-hmm.
263,00:17:13.92,00:17:13.92,If he could take Courtney to the final two and he may just
264,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,"win a million dollars. Against anyone else, I don't"
265,00:17:17.96,00:17:17.96,"know how good his chances are, and I think he knows that, so"
266,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,Courtney to me is more dangerous now than having Terry
267,00:17:24.79,00:17:24.79,around. So I just want to get rid of
268,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,"Courtney as soon as I possibly can, and then go from there."
269,00:17:35.08,00:17:35.08,"Oh, damn, they're getting out again."
270,00:17:37.29,00:17:37.29,(yelling) Jump!
271,00:17:44.04,00:17:44.04,>> You do? >> Yeah.
272,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,>> With what? >> With...
273,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,">> A fishing pole? >> Yeah, where is the hook?"
274,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,"Oh, I see it. All right."
275,00:17:53.25,00:17:53.25,I'll be back with fish. (laughing)
276,00:17:57.42,00:17:57.42,I figure how hard can it be? I've fished before when I was
277,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,younger with my dad with a standard fishing pole.
278,00:18:05.50,00:18:05.50,"So I figure, well, everyone else has tried it."
279,00:18:07.88,00:18:07.88,"Let me try it. Oh, gosh, sorry, snail."
280,00:18:14.54,00:18:14.54,Yuck! This is so gross!
281,00:18:18.00,00:18:18.00,I need a bigger rock. (yelling)
282,00:18:26.12,00:18:26.12,Sorry. Oh! I think I got a fish!
283,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,"It's going! It's going! Oh, no!"
284,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,What's that? Is that a puffer?
285,00:18:48.54,00:18:48.54,What is that? Shane is going to be so happy.
286,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,I'm scared it's going to come off!
287,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,I can't touch it. Hold still.
288,00:19:03.54,00:19:03.54,Don't move! Don't move! Wait till I can get...
289,00:19:10.62,00:19:10.62,Somebody needs to help me. Dead yet?
290,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,Damn! \xe2\x99\xaa Happy birthday to you
291,00:19:28.62,00:19:28.62,Happy birthday to you. \xe2\x99\xaa >> Unbelievable.
292,00:19:34.79,00:19:34.79,How did that happen? >> I was so happy.
293,00:19:38.79,00:19:38.79,"I was so, so happy to have caught a fish, especially a"
294,00:19:42.58,00:19:42.58,"fish that big, and it's Shane's birthday."
295,00:19:45.46,00:19:45.46,>> Unbelievable! >> Happy birthday.
296,00:19:47.29,00:19:47.29,>> I'm so proud of you! >> To see the look on Shane's
297,00:19:50.46,00:19:50.46,"face, it was priceless, priceless."
298,00:19:53.62,00:19:53.62,">> Cirie Fields caught the biggest fish out here, the girl"
299,00:19:56.96,00:19:56.96,from Jersey. Captain America has been
300,00:20:00.33,00:20:00.33,"swimming around for three weeks, nothing."
301,00:20:03.50,00:20:03.50,"How great is that? >> Oh, here they come!"
302,00:20:10.12,00:20:10.12,">> When we returned from our reward, we got a pleasant"
303,00:20:13.21,00:20:13.21,"surprise. >> I caught a fish, girl!"
304,00:20:17.25,00:20:17.25,">> You did? >> Wow! Awesome, Cirie!"
305,00:20:21.12,00:20:21.12,">> You speared it? >> No, I just fished with the"
306,00:20:23.54,00:20:23.54,little thing. Who would've thunk Cirie could
307,00:20:25.92,00:20:25.92,catch a fish? That's the joy in waiting for
308,00:20:28.67,00:20:28.67,"them to see the fish, for me. (laughs)"
309,00:20:33.46,00:20:33.46,"I love it, love it, love it, love it."
310,00:21:08.67,00:21:08.67,">> Right, right, I agree. Danielle asked me about, ""Well,"
311,00:21:12.04,00:21:12.04,"if you win, who are you going to take to the finals?"""
312,00:21:14.25,00:21:14.25,"You know, ""Are you going to take Courtney?"
313,00:21:15.92,00:21:15.92,Because it might be easier for you to win the million if you
314,00:21:17.38,00:21:17.38,"took her."" To be honest with you, if I had"
315,00:21:20.50,00:21:20.50,"my druthers, I would take Courtney to the finals, and I'm"
316,00:21:23.38,00:21:23.38,sure Danielle would take Courtney to the finals.
317,00:21:35.58,00:21:35.58,>> I know. >> I want to make sure that
318,00:22:00.42,00:22:00.42,"we're going into this agreement in a very fair way, so final"
319,00:22:04.04,00:22:04.04,"three challenge is, top two finishers go to the finals."
320,00:22:08.33,00:22:08.33,And-and I'm all for that. You got to beat the best and be
321,00:22:11.21,00:22:11.21,the best. >> It was extremely insulting
322,00:22:41.08,00:22:41.08,"to me when she said, you know, ""I don't want to have someone"
323,00:22:45.29,00:22:45.29,"being carried in here."" And she didn't even see that,"
324,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,"you know? I was, like, ""Do you underst..."""
325,00:22:49.62,00:22:49.62,"Like, of course I'm going to be mad."
326,00:22:51.58,00:22:51.58,Who are you speaking to right now?
327,00:22:53.67,00:22:53.67,"""Someone being carried in."" You're referring to me, because"
328,00:22:57.12,00:22:57.12,I'm the easiest one to beat. >> What is she talking about?
329,00:23:25.46,00:23:25.46,"Um... whoever wins what? I don't know, I've lost that"
330,00:23:29.42,00:23:29.42,part. >> If Terry came in first...
331,00:23:31.50,00:23:31.50,>> Mm-hmm. Whoever came in second should be the person he'd
332,00:23:34.17,00:23:34.17,take? >> Yeah.
333,00:23:36.54,00:23:36.54,">> Of course he would tell you that, because if you look at the"
334,00:23:39.21,00:23:39.21,"three of us, who do you think is going to come in second?"
335,00:23:43.33,00:23:43.33,"Since their little thing yesterday, Danielle... they done"
336,00:23:47.21,00:23:47.21,"brainwashed her, and I keep trying to point out to her, she"
337,00:23:50.00,00:23:50.00,"wants to go with Terry and Courtney and myself, which, of"
338,00:23:54.12,00:23:54.12,"course, I'll be number four. Come on, now, I'm not stupid."
339,00:23:58.17,00:23:58.17,But why would you want to take her with us and give her first
340,00:24:01.21,00:24:01.21,or second place? I keep... I don't know why she
341,00:24:04.88,00:24:04.88,can't see that. If we take away the person he
342,00:24:11.04,00:24:11.04,"wants to take second, he doesn't have to know who we're gonna"
343,00:24:14.38,00:24:14.38,vote. He can think we're going to
344,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,vote Aras. You can't let him dictate what
345,00:24:19.54,00:24:19.54,"y'all should do, and that's basically what he's doing:"
346,00:24:22.58,00:24:22.58,"""No, go with me, and then I'll see who I decide who I want..."
347,00:24:25.54,00:24:25.54,"I'll take second, maybe the most athletic, but nine times"
348,00:24:28.29,00:24:28.29,"out of ten, I'm going to take Courtney, because I know I can"
349,00:24:31.12,00:24:31.12,"beat her. But I'll tell Danielle, yeah,"
350,00:24:33.17,00:24:33.17,"that's what we'll do, whoever is number two, then"
351,00:24:35.17,00:24:35.17,"that's who I'll take."" Yeah, mm-hmm, and I got a"
352,00:24:38.04,00:24:38.04,"bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. I want to get rid of Courtney,"
353,00:24:45.54,00:24:45.54,"like, yesterday. Some kind of way, Courtney's"
354,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,"going, believe that. (laughs)"
355,00:24:55.92,00:24:55.92,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Aras,"
356,00:25:10.38,00:25:10.38,returning once again from Exile Island.
357,00:25:16.58,00:25:16.58,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
358,00:25:18.46,00:25:18.46,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first.
359,00:25:20.38,00:25:20.38,"Terry, give it up. Three individual immunity"
360,00:25:28.88,00:25:28.88,"challenges, three times Terry's won."
361,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,We'll see if that continues today.
362,00:25:33.46,00:25:33.46,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
363,00:25:36.08,00:25:36.08,"For today's challenge, you are going to hold your own weight."
364,00:25:39.67,00:25:39.67,Here's how it works. You are going to each kneel at
365,00:25:42.50,00:25:42.50,the end of a long plank suspended over a pit of water.
366,00:25:45.88,00:25:45.88,You'll be holding on to two ropes that are connected to a
367,00:25:48.17,00:25:48.17,hook. Hanging from the hook is weight.
368,00:25:51.21,00:25:51.21,We'll start with 20% of your body weight.
369,00:25:53.71,00:25:53.71,Every 15 minutes we'll add more weight.
370,00:25:56.21,00:25:56.21,"As the weight gets heavier, it will get harder to hold on to"
371,00:25:59.08,00:25:59.08,those ropes. When the weight becomes too
372,00:26:01.04,00:26:01.04,"much, the ropes'll slip from your hands, the platform will"
373,00:26:04.08,00:26:04.08,"fall, you'll drop into the water."
374,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,"The last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a"
375,00:26:09.62,00:26:09.62,spot in the final five. Ready to get at it?
376,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, weigh in."
377,00:26:13.62,00:26:13.62,"Get started. All right, everybody has their"

379,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,"weight. Three, two, one."
380,00:26:32.62,00:26:32.62,This challenge is on. You are holding 20% of your
381,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,"body weight right now. Shane, Cirie, Aras, Terry"
382,00:26:39.29,00:26:39.29,all holding right around 34 pounds.
383,00:26:41.92,00:26:41.92,Danielle and Courtney holding about 24 pounds.
384,00:26:44.50,00:26:44.50,"And we're just getting started. When we reach 15 minutes, we"
385,00:27:14.54,00:27:14.54,"will add another ten percent of your body weight, roughly"
386,00:27:18.12,00:27:18.12,another 12 to 15 pounds for each of you.
387,00:27:21.38,00:27:21.38,Shane feeling those ropes slipping through his hands.
388,00:27:24.25,00:27:24.25,>> I'm not going to make it. >> PROBST: Shane has lost one
389,00:27:31.42,00:27:31.42,rope. He's down to one rope.
390,00:27:34.25,00:27:34.25,That rope is not coming back. Shane now holding all of his
391,00:27:37.08,00:27:37.08,weight with one hand. Shane lets go.
392,00:27:44.46,00:27:44.46,Shane is the first one out of the challenge.
393,00:27:52.71,00:27:52.71,"Okay, it's been 15 minutes. We're going to add another ten"
394,00:27:55.71,00:27:55.71,percent of your body weight to the hook.
395,00:27:59.12,00:27:59.12,"Three, two, one. Everybody has another ten"
396,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,percent now. (groans)
397,00:28:19.71,00:28:19.71,">> It's burning my hands, the rope."
398,00:28:22.04,00:28:22.04,>> PROBST: You guys have made it 30 days.
399,00:28:24.12,00:28:24.12,Nobody give up. (grunting)
400,00:28:30.08,00:28:30.08,"It's slipping. >> PROBST: Cirie, second one out"
401,00:28:35.50,00:28:35.50,of the challenge. We are down to four.
402,00:28:37.88,00:28:37.88,"Aras, Terry, Danielle and Courtney."
403,00:28:45.67,00:28:45.67,Aras struggling to get a different grip.
404,00:28:53.25,00:28:53.25,"Danielle struggling to hang on. Danielle, third one out of the"
405,00:29:01.67,00:29:01.67,challenge. We are now down to three.
406,00:29:04.54,00:29:04.54,"Aras, Terry, Courtney holding 30% of your body weight."
407,00:29:10.25,00:29:10.25,"(groans) >> Hold on, Aras."
408,00:29:26.04,00:29:26.04,">> PROBST: Aras just lets go. Two days on Exile Island, too"
409,00:29:30.08,00:29:30.08,tough to overcome. We are down to two: Terry and
410,00:29:34.08,00:29:34.08,"Courtney. >> He's wavering, honey."
411,00:29:39.25,00:29:39.25,You're going to beat him. >> PROBST: You've reached 30
412,00:29:51.83,00:29:51.83,minutes. We're going to add ten more
413,00:29:54.12,00:29:54.12,"percent of your body weight. Three, two, one."
414,00:29:58.67,00:29:58.67,Release. >> PROBST: You are now both
415,00:30:08.08,00:30:08.08,"holding 40% of your body weight. Terry is holding 68 pounds,"
416,00:30:13.00,00:30:13.00,Courtney holding 49 pounds. Terry digging down deep.
417,00:30:21.00,00:30:21.00,"Immunity on the line. >> Watch your weights, Court."
418,00:30:24.12,00:30:24.12,They're getting close to the bottom.
419,00:30:25.38,00:30:25.38,">> I know. I know. >> Hold on, Court."
420,00:30:30.54,00:30:30.54,"Hang on, honey, he's failing. I can see it. He's dying."
421,00:30:33.54,00:30:33.54,>> PROBST: The only way to make sure you do not get voted out
422,00:30:36.25,00:30:36.25,tonight is to win this challenge.
423,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,">> Hold on, Court. >> PROBST: Courtney down to one"
424,00:30:43.42,00:30:43.42,rope. (groans)
425,00:30:53.25,00:30:53.25,She can't do it. Courtney's in the water.
426,00:30:55.75,00:30:55.75,Terry wins his fourth straight immunity.
427,00:31:01.00,00:31:01.00,"Terry, come on over. For the fourth straight time you"
428,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,win immunity. You're the only person to wear
429,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,this necklace so far in this game.
430,00:31:12.25,00:31:12.25,"Once again, you're safe at Tribal Council."
431,00:31:14.12,00:31:14.12,"For the rest of you, after 30 days, one of you going home"
432,00:31:17.54,00:31:17.54,tonight. See you at Tribal.
433,00:31:19.21,00:31:19.21,Grab your stuff. Head on back.
434,00:31:34.92,00:31:34.92,">> Oh, I tell you what. Winning today was awesome."
435,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,"Somebody from Casaya is going home tonight, and I think Aras"
436,00:31:41.42,00:31:41.42,"knows that he's the target, and he is."
437,00:31:46.25,00:31:46.25,>> Aras is still our biggest threat.
438,00:31:49.25,00:31:49.25,"I mean, no one can beat him in the final."
439,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,">> Right. >> He's still, like,"
440,00:31:52.58,00:31:52.58,"competitive, but at least we're secure for final four."
441,00:31:57.12,00:31:57.12,">> With me, you, Danielle, and Terry?"
442,00:31:59.00,00:31:59.00,">> Yeah, I mean, that's, like, solid."
443,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,"So we're gonna agree, you, me, Danielle and Terry all"
444,00:32:04.83,00:32:04.83,vote Aras. And then Aras and Shane are
445,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,gonna vote Danielle out. And we'll pretend like we're
446,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,"voting for Danielle. >> Yeah, please don't say"
447,00:32:12.08,00:32:12.08,anything to Shane. >> I won't.
448,00:32:13.96,00:32:13.96,"I can deal with it later, but not now."
449,00:32:16.25,00:32:16.25,>> Okay. >> Cirie and I decided Cirie and
450,00:32:18.79,00:32:18.79,"Terry, Danielle and I are all going to vote for Aras."
451,00:32:21.42,00:32:21.42,Shane thinks that I'm going to do whatever he says and he wants
452,00:32:24.79,00:32:24.79,"me to vote Danielle out, and he wants Cirie to vote Danielle"
453,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,out. So I'm going to be dealing with
454,00:32:29.38,00:32:29.38,"the wrath of Shane for sure tonight, and I'm not excited"
455,00:32:33.08,00:32:33.08,about it. (whistling)
456,00:32:43.12,00:32:43.12,>> You kicked my ass. >> I could have kicked your ass.
457,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,>> You kicked my ass. >> But we're working this out
458,00:32:47.33,00:32:47.33,"so we're gonna make this a joint effort, okay?"
459,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,>> Okay. I'm confident with Courtney and Danielle and I'm
460,00:32:52.83,00:32:52.83,"feeling pretty damn good. We're going to send Aras home,"
461,00:32:57.96,00:32:57.96,"and with that, we'll have a three-to-two advantage, and you"
462,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,know what? It's gonna be nice.
463,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,>> Yeah. >> What'd you say?
464,00:33:13.29,00:33:13.29,">> Courtney, are you okay? >> Yeah."
465,00:33:15.58,00:33:15.58,">> You sure? >> I mean, no, nothing's okay."
466,00:33:17.21,00:33:17.21,">> Right, but I mean, this is the game, that's it, Danielle,"
467,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,"one, two, three, four. And we each move on one more"
468,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,spot. >> Shane wants to take Courtney
469,00:33:27.54,00:33:27.54,to the final two. He's told me that.
470,00:33:29.54,00:33:29.54,Terry wants to take Courtney to the final two.
471,00:33:31.75,00:33:31.75,"That, to me, makes Courtney the most dangerous person out here."
472,00:33:34.67,00:33:34.67,I want to kind of mess up Terry's plans and mess up
473,00:33:38.21,00:33:38.21,"Shane's plans and hopefully we get rid of Courtney next, and"
474,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,"then it could possibly give me, Aras and Danielle a little"
475,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,more leverage in this game. I just wanted to make sure you
476,00:33:47.54,00:33:47.54,knew exactly what was going on yesterday.
477,00:33:49.96,00:33:49.96,>> Cirie was quick to fill me in on the situation.
478,00:33:52.79,00:33:52.79,"She really has my back, which is nice."
479,00:33:54.92,00:33:54.92,She let me know about the goings-on.
480,00:33:57.17,00:33:57.17,And basically what's going on now is we're going to vote for
481,00:34:00.88,00:34:00.88,Courtney. >> But the only way to save you
482,00:34:03.08,00:34:03.08,"is to vote Courtney. But I need to talk to you, too."
483,00:34:07.21,00:34:07.21,>> I'm just trying to see what would be the best situation for
484,00:34:10.00,00:34:10.00,"me. Would I rather be with Terry,"
485,00:34:12.00,00:34:12.00,"Courtney, Cirie and I, or would I rather be with Aras, Cirie"
486,00:34:16.25,00:34:16.25,and I? I'm just trying to see what the
487,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,best situation for myself would be.
488,00:34:21.08,00:34:21.08,">> Well, anyway, we're gonna have to keep telling Shane that"
489,00:34:24.67,00:34:24.67,we're going to vote you. I swear to God I won't vote you.
490,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,"And me, you and Aras vote Courtney because Shane is"
491,00:34:30.04,00:34:30.04,gonna vote you. Terry and Courtney are gonna
492,00:34:32.96,00:34:32.96,"vote Aras, and me and you and Aras are gonna vote Courtney."
493,00:34:36.29,00:34:36.29,"Absolutely positive, that's why you have to let Courtney think"
494,00:34:40.25,00:34:40.25,"that me, you, her and Terry are gonna vote Aras."
495,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,"But if you wouldn't be here tomorrow, me, you and Aras have"
496,00:34:46.96,00:34:46.96,to vote Courtney. I'm hoping Danielle just stays
497,00:34:50.21,00:34:50.21,strong 'cause Danielle gets real nervous and it's easy to
498,00:34:53.04,00:34:53.04,turn her. I'm hoping she just stays calm
499,00:34:56.21,00:34:56.21,tonight and follows through with the plan.
500,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
501,00:35:19.71,00:35:19.71,"Austin, Sally... and Bruce..."
502,00:35:26.42,00:35:26.42,(applause) ...returning from a brief stay
503,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,in Panama City Hospital. He'll continue on and be a
504,00:35:34.25,00:35:34.25,member of our jury from here on out.
505,00:35:36.21,00:35:36.21,Let's talk about the reward challenge.
506,00:35:38.08,00:35:38.08,"Terry, was there some bonding going on between the three of"
507,00:35:40.29,00:35:40.29,"you? >> It was a team bonding, you"
508,00:35:42.29,00:35:42.29,"know, because we came together as a team, gave us maybe a"
509,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,little time to forget the game and just dig in on a standard
510,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,"beach barbecue. So, you know, it was, it was"
511,00:35:52.12,00:35:52.12,"awesome. >> PROBST: Cirie, when you hear"
512,00:35:53.96,00:35:53.96,"Terry say it was nice to put the game aside for a little bit, do"
513,00:35:56.88,00:35:56.88,"you buy that? >> No, please."
514,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,"I mean, it's a game. And he may want us to think"
515,00:36:02.46,00:36:02.46,"that they were just having fun and barbecuing, but we all know"
516,00:36:07.29,00:36:07.29,better. As long as you're here and your
517,00:36:09.04,00:36:09.04,"torch is lit, the game is still going on."
518,00:36:11.67,00:36:11.67,">> PROBST: So we get to today's immunity challenge, once again,"
519,00:36:15.12,00:36:15.12,"Terry wins. Four individual challenges,"
520,00:36:18.12,00:36:18.12,Terry's won four times. Has anybody started to approach
521,00:36:21.08,00:36:21.08,"you and say, ""Hey, let's work something out 'cause you seem"
522,00:36:24.04,00:36:24.04,"unstoppable""? >> You know, people aren't"
523,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,"running up to me going, ""Hey, T.D., let's do this, let's do"
524,00:36:28.46,00:36:28.46,"that,"" you know? This tribe has been pretty damn"
525,00:36:31.71,00:36:31.71,tight. So you know what?
526,00:36:33.42,00:36:33.42,The pressure's up; every immunity challenge I got to
527,00:36:35.50,00:36:35.50,"win. >> PROBST: So, Aras, Casaya"
528,00:36:39.04,00:36:39.04,"still holding strong. >> From my perspective, I think"
529,00:36:41.25,00:36:41.25,"so. I mean, the reality is tonight"
530,00:36:42.79,00:36:42.79,"someone from Casaya has to go home, and I'm fully aware that"
531,00:36:45.75,00:36:45.75,the target is nice and large on my back.
532,00:36:48.54,00:36:48.54,>> PROBST: Let's talk about the pros and cons of keeping Aras
533,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,"in the tribe. On the bad side, you're a"
534,00:36:53.50,00:36:53.50,"threat. But on the flip side, if Casaya"
535,00:36:55.38,00:36:55.38,"is staying strong, you hold the best chance of defeating Terry."
536,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,Fair to say? >> I think I do have a good
537,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,"chance of beating Terry, and do people feel comfortable voting"
538,00:37:04.08,00:37:04.08,off the arguably the most athletic member of the Casaya
539,00:37:07.67,00:37:07.67,five? I think they have a better
540,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,"chance with me. >> PROBST: Shane, what do you"
541,00:37:11.75,00:37:11.75,base the vote on when you're getting rid of one of your own?
542,00:37:14.38,00:37:14.38,Would it be a mistake at this point in the game to start
543,00:37:17.04,00:37:17.04,thinking about who you want to take to the final two?
544,00:37:20.17,00:37:20.17,"Is it too early for that? >> Tonight, we have to eat one"
545,00:37:23.58,00:37:23.58,"of our own, and that's... Sounds dramatic, but it's going"
546,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,"to be dramatic. I mean, I know that, like,"
547,00:37:29.88,00:37:29.88,people are running stuff in their head about who they might
548,00:37:32.50,00:37:32.50,want to position themselves to be around.
549,00:37:34.08,00:37:34.08,We're going to have to shrink a little bit before the path is
550,00:37:37.04,00:37:37.04,"over, for sure. >> PROBST: How about you,"
551,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,Danielle? Thoughts through your head
552,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,"about this is who I would like to sit next to in the final two,"
553,00:37:43.21,00:37:43.21,and this is who I don't want to to sit next to?
554,00:37:46.00,00:37:46.00,">> My brain is, like, about to explode."
555,00:37:47.58,00:37:47.58,"I can't stop running numbers in my head, to be honest with you."
556,00:37:50.50,00:37:50.50,">> PROBST: Courtney, a couple of challenges ago, you took"
557,00:37:53.25,00:37:53.25,"a lot of hits. >> Please, let's get through...!"
558,00:37:55.62,00:37:55.62,">> PROBST: You were labeled the person who wouldn't shut up,"
559,00:37:58.38,00:37:58.38,"the most annoying, the biggest poseur."
560,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,Do you imagine whether people would want to take you to final
561,00:38:03.50,00:38:03.50,two or not take you based on the perception of the tribe of who
562,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,"you are? >> Um, I think that when it"
563,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,"comes down to who people want to take to the final two, I think"
564,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,that decision has to be made much further down the line.
565,00:38:15.92,00:38:15.92,I'm not holding onto that challenge.
566,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,I don't think anyone else is. It's sort of like you're on a
567,00:38:20.88,00:38:20.88,"clean slate. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"
568,00:38:25.25,00:38:25.25,the vote. Terry has individual immunity.
569,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,Any chance of giving that up to someone else?
570,00:38:29.29,00:38:29.29,>> Negative. >> PROBST: There is still the
571,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,hidden immunity idol which has yet to come into play.
572,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,"If it does, you'll let me know after the votes are read."
573,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"It is time to vote. Cirie, you're up."
574,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,>> This is just a strategic move.
575,00:38:50.79,00:38:50.79,I can't settle for third or fourth place after the things
576,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,I've heard. >> You are the ultimate
577,00:39:03.92,00:39:03.92,competitor. I couldn't have asked for a
578,00:39:06.33,00:39:06.33,"better rival, but you are still the #1 threat."
579,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,">> You get to eat as much as you want, and I will never yell"
580,00:39:23.88,00:39:23.88,"at you again. >> You're so beautiful, brother,"
581,00:39:33.88,00:39:33.88,but this is for strategy. Namaste.
582,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
583,00:40:08.58,00:40:08.58,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
584,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
585,00:40:13.12,00:40:13.12,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
586,00:40:17.79,00:40:17.79,First vote: Aras. Danielle.
587,00:40:28.12,00:40:28.12,"Aras. Two votes Aras,"
588,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,one vote Danielle. Courtney.
589,00:40:34.92,00:40:34.92,"That's one vote Courtney, two votes Aras, one vote Danielle."
590,00:40:40.46,00:40:40.46,"Courtney. That's two votes Courtney, two"
591,00:40:43.25,00:40:43.25,"votes Aras, one vote Danielle. The 11th person voted out of"
592,00:40:50.88,00:40:50.88,"Survivor, Exile Island: Courtney."
593,00:40:55.83,00:40:55.83,You need to grab your torch. >> That was a shocker.
594,00:41:06.88,00:41:06.88,">> PROBST: Courtney, the tribe has spoken."
595,00:41:10.67,00:41:10.67,"It's time for you to go. Well, after tonight's vote, I"
596,00:41:23.21,00:41:23.21,don't think there's any doubt that this is now an individual
597,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,game. Grab your torches.
598,00:41:27.88,00:41:27.88,Head back to camp. Good night.

601,00:41:45.96,00:41:45.96,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
602,00:41:50.92,00:41:50.92,Survivor: >> PROBST: Aras and Cirie
603,00:41:54.08,00:41:54.08,cover their tracks. >> In my viewpoint there is no
604,00:42:01.33,00:42:01.33,choice. >> PROBST: Aras has had enough.
605,00:42:03.71,00:42:03.71,>> You're starting to offend me. >> PROBST: And Shane is brought
606,00:42:06.54,00:42:06.54,to his knees. >> Oh!
607,00:42:14.88,00:42:14.88,>> I'm just completely shocked right now.
608,00:42:17.96,00:42:17.96,My sisters-- that I unfortunately trusted-- turned
609,00:42:21.75,00:42:21.75,on me. I guess they saw me a little
610,00:42:23.83,00:42:23.83,bit too much of a threat for going to the final two.
611,00:42:26.54,00:42:26.54,But that's the way it goes. And life goes on from here.
612,00:42:29.42,00:42:29.42,"You know, I'm gonna continue to live my dreams and make it"
613,00:42:31.83,00:42:31.83,"happen, and that's what matters."
