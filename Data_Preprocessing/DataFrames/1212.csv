191,00:12:29.88,00:12:29.88,Terry clips his third tile.That's not enough.
192,00:12:34.25,00:12:34.25,Courtney and Terry both onlyhave one tile left.
193,00:12:37.12,00:12:37.12,Either one could win thischallenge on this shot.
194,00:12:42.92,00:12:42.92,"Ready, aim, fire.Danielle just misses."
195,00:12:48.42,00:12:48.42,"Courtney just misses.>> Yes, yes, yes!"
196,00:12:52.67,00:12:52.67,>> PROBST: Terry gets it!Terry wins the GMC Yukon.
197,00:12:56.38,00:12:56.38,>> Unbelievable.>> PROBST: Here's how it's
198,00:12:58.04,00:12:58.04,going to work.You're going to fly to an
199,00:13:00.00,00:13:00.00,"island.When you land, your car will be"
200,00:13:02.04,00:13:02.04,waiting for you.It will be loaded with
201,00:13:04.21,00:13:04.21,everything you need for yourbarbecue.
202,00:13:05.88,00:13:05.88,">> All right, all right.>> PROBST: You'll return to camp"
203,00:13:07.71,00:13:07.71,back later today.>> Excellent.
204,00:13:09.92,00:13:09.92,>> PROBST: Grab your stuff andhead on out.
205,00:13:11.46,00:13:11.46,">> All right, let's go barbecue!>> At this point in the game,"
206,00:13:33.42,00:13:33.42,"from what I understand, theidol's not here anymore."
207,00:13:36.92,00:13:36.92,"It's been found, and now it'shiding somewhere in Terry's bag."
208,00:13:40.33,00:13:40.33,And so I won't really waste anyof my energy looking for it or
209,00:13:43.79,00:13:43.79,stressing about it because thatpart of the game is now out of
210,00:13:46.58,00:13:46.58,my control.Kind of makes my stay here
211,00:13:51.83,00:13:51.83,pretty unnecessary in terms ofthe positives.
212,00:14:05.46,00:14:05.46,>> We were airplaned off to afar island where we were to
213,00:14:09.54,00:14:09.54,"have our feast.>> Oh, it's gorgeous!"
214,00:14:15.42,00:14:15.42,">> Oh, my God!>> At the end of the runway,"
215,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,"there in front of us was abrand-new, spankin' Yukon, and"
216,00:14:22.38,00:14:22.38,"it was righteous, man.>> Wow!"
217,00:14:26.75,00:14:26.75,"Oh, mother of...>> This is gorgeous."
218,00:14:31.00,00:14:31.00,">> The last thing my wife saidgoing out the door was, ""Damn"
219,00:14:33.67,00:14:33.67,"it, just bring me home a car.""Let's see what this bad boy can"
220,00:14:39.79,00:14:39.79,"do.In pile the girls, and off we"
221,00:14:42.33,00:14:42.33,drove to this beach feast.Oh!
222,00:14:53.92,00:14:53.92,">> This is so nice to, like, beon the winning side of things."
223,00:14:59.33,00:14:59.33,"That's like, seriously, like,was, like, the dream team."
224,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,">> Salud!Congratulations, Terry."
225,00:15:04.88,00:15:04.88,>> Thank you.>> I would do anything to get
226,00:15:10.67,00:15:10.67,us to a final three.>> I'm 100% behind you.
227,00:15:15.04,00:15:15.04,"I mean, that's a great finalthree, wouldn't you say?"
228,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,>> I'm going to start puttingout some feelers to Courtney
229,00:15:21.21,00:15:21.21,"and Danielle today, try toforge a relationship with those"
230,00:15:23.29,00:15:23.29,guys in order to take us to thefinal three.
231,00:15:26.29,00:15:26.29,">> The thing is, if you justwin the next immunity challenge"
232,00:15:29.12,00:15:29.12,"and take Aras out, and the nextone, one of us will win, and we"
233,00:15:31.58,00:15:31.58,take Shane out...>> Shane out.
234,00:15:33.08,00:15:33.08,">> ...and boom, we're finalfour, done."
235,00:15:35.25,00:15:35.25,It's been in the back of mymind to join up with Terry for
236,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,like a long time because goingagainst Terry is one pretty
237,00:15:42.50,00:15:42.50,good shot of actually winningthe million in the final two.
238,00:15:46.88,00:15:46.88,I think that's kind of howpeople are looking right now is
239,00:15:49.29,00:15:49.29,who do you want to be upagainst in the final two?
240,00:15:53.88,00:15:53.88,">> Well, D, I was talking toCourtney while you were gone."
241,00:15:57.83,00:15:57.83,"You know, we talked kind oflike the dream final three,"
242,00:16:00.50,00:16:00.50,"final four, whatever.And if you were with us, and"
243,00:16:03.88,00:16:03.88,"it was us three and Cirie, youwould have a 75% chance of"
244,00:16:08.54,00:16:08.54,"winning immunity, and thatwould be pitting us three up"
245,00:16:11.96,00:16:11.96,against Cirie.If I can produce the hidden
246,00:16:14.92,00:16:14.92,"immunity idol, then, you know,even so, we've got three people."
247,00:16:19.46,00:16:19.46,We'd have to beat Cirie.>> Uh-huh.
248,00:16:22.42,00:16:22.42,Terry brought up the fact thathis ideal four would be the
249,00:16:25.04,00:16:25.04,"three girls and him, and that'sjust a given."
250,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,"I mean, obviously, he wantsAras out."
251,00:16:31.21,00:16:31.21,"For his sake.I like that idea, but he's"
252,00:16:35.25,00:16:35.25,"going to have to change up hisstrategy a little bit, too."
253,00:16:37.83,00:16:37.83,I'm not going to make this soeasy for him to win.
254,00:16:49.92,00:16:49.92,">> It's just the two of us, andwe can talk about strategy all"
255,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,"we want.We're through to the five,"
256,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,right?>> Right.
257,00:16:59.83,00:16:59.83,">> If Terry wins immunity, me,you, and Aras are still"
258,00:17:02.08,00:17:02.08,"through, because we're going tovote off Danielle."
259,00:17:04.33,00:17:04.33,>> But then there's stillCourtney.
260,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"It will be me, you, andCourtney."
261,00:17:10.92,00:17:10.92,Right.Mm-hmm.
262,00:17:13.92,00:17:13.92,If he could take Courtney tothe final two and he may just
263,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,"win a million dollars.Against anyone else, I don't"
264,00:17:17.96,00:17:17.96,"know how good his chances are,and I think he knows that, so"
265,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,Courtney to me is moredangerous now than having Terry
266,00:17:24.79,00:17:24.79,around.So I just want to get rid of
267,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,"Courtney as soon as I possiblycan, and then go from there."
268,00:17:35.08,00:17:35.08,"Oh, damn, they're getting outagain."
269,00:17:37.29,00:17:37.29,(yelling)Jump!
270,00:17:44.04,00:17:44.04,>> You do?>> Yeah.
271,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,>> With what?>> With...
272,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,">> A fishing pole?>> Yeah, where is the hook?"
273,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,"Oh, I see it.All right."
274,00:17:53.25,00:17:53.25,I'll be back with fish.(laughing)
275,00:17:57.42,00:17:57.42,I figure how hard can it be?I've fished before when I was
276,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,younger with my dad with astandard fishing pole.
277,00:18:05.50,00:18:05.50,"So I figure, well, everyoneelse has tried it."
278,00:18:07.88,00:18:07.88,"Let me try it.Oh, gosh, sorry, snail."
279,00:18:14.54,00:18:14.54,Yuck!This is so gross!
280,00:18:18.00,00:18:18.00,I need a bigger rock.(yelling)
281,00:18:26.12,00:18:26.12,Sorry.Oh! I think I got a fish!
282,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,"It's going! It's going!Oh, no!"
283,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,What's that?Is that a puffer?
284,00:18:48.54,00:18:48.54,What is that?Shane is going to be so happy.
285,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,I'm scared it's going to comeoff!
286,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,I can't touch it.Hold still.
287,00:19:03.54,00:19:03.54,Don't move! Don't move!Wait till I can get...
288,00:19:10.62,00:19:10.62,Somebody needs to help me.Dead yet?
289,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,Damn!♪ Happy birthday to you

308,00:20:33.46,00:20:33.46,"I love it, love it, love it,love it."
309,00:21:08.67,00:21:08.67,">> Right, right, I agree.Danielle asked me about, ""Well,"

312,00:21:15.92,00:21:15.92,Because it might be easier foryou to win the million if you

337,00:23:54.12,00:23:54.12,"course, I'll be number four.Come on, now, I'm not stupid."
338,00:23:58.17,00:23:58.17,But why would you want to takeher with us and give her first
339,00:24:01.21,00:24:01.21,or second place?I keep... I don't know why she
340,00:24:04.88,00:24:04.88,can't see that.If we take away the person he

342,00:24:14.38,00:24:14.38,vote.He can think we're going to
343,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,vote Aras.You can't let him dictate what

352,00:24:45.54,00:24:45.54,"like, yesterday.Some kind of way, Courtney's"
353,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,"going, believe that.(laughs)"

472,00:33:38.21,00:33:38.21,"Shane's plans and hopefully weget rid of Courtney next, and"
473,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33,"then it could possibly give me,Aras and Danielle a little"
474,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,more leverage in this game.I just wanted to make sure you
475,00:33:47.54,00:33:47.54,knew exactly what was going onyesterday.
