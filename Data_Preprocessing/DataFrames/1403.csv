2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,Survivor: >> Water!
3,00:00:05.12,00:00:05.12,">> Just lick some leaves, man. >>PROBST: Life at Ravu was"
4,00:00:07.12,00:00:07.12,bleak. >> I never experienced
5,00:00:09.04,00:00:09.04,dehydration like this. Half of us can't even stand up.
6,00:00:11.12,00:00:11.12,"It's crazy! We're starving here, bro."
7,00:00:14.29,00:00:14.29,>> Life at Moto was carefree. >> We have a really plush couch.
8,00:00:20.04,00:00:20.04,We are very fortunate to be living the way that we're
9,00:00:22.58,00:00:22.58,"living. >> Boo, be careful!"
10,00:00:24.17,00:00:24.17,>> PROBST: And Boo got careless. >> Boo is a real hazard to
11,00:00:28.92,00:00:28.92,"hisself, and he will hurt hisself out of the game."
12,00:00:33.29,00:00:33.29,>> Sylvia. >> Is she here?
13,00:00:35.58,00:00:35.58,>> PROBST: Sylvia joined Ravu  after a night on Exile Island.
14,00:00:38.21,00:00:38.21,">> Welcome home! When I went up to greet her, I"
15,00:00:40.88,00:00:40.88,"was actually quite nasty. I look over her shoulder, and"
16,00:00:43.33,00:00:43.33,I open up her shoulder bag to see if she found the immunity
17,00:00:46.08,00:00:46.08,"idol. >> Tonight, we ought to go out"
18,00:00:48.12,00:00:48.12,and get some oysters. >> PROBST: But her presence
19,00:00:50.42,00:00:50.42,brought on new frustrations. >> I was not really excited for
20,00:00:53.25,00:00:53.25,Sylvia to come back. I personally think she's a
21,00:00:55.88,00:00:55.88,little bossy. >> PROBST: At the immunity
22,00:00:58.83,00:00:58.83,challenge... >> I'm pulling out the...
23,00:01:00.88,00:01:00.88,>> PROBST: Erica's certain she's right!
24,00:01:03.00,00:01:03.00,"Erica spoke up, while Moto pulled ahead."
25,00:01:05.92,00:01:05.92,Moto wins the challenge! Moto.
26,00:01:11.12,00:01:11.12,"Moto took home fishing supplies, and banished Earl, who battled"
27,00:01:14.96,00:01:14.96,the serpents on Exile Island. Facing Tribal Council...
28,00:01:22.88,00:01:22.88,>> PROBST: ...Mooky and Rocky turned against Erica...
29,00:01:25.04,00:01:25.04,">> Now you want Erica, huh? She freaked out."
30,00:01:27.04,00:01:27.04,>> PROBST: ...blaming her for Ravu's loss.
31,00:01:29.21,00:01:29.21,">> She was screaming, she's on people about peace and this"
32,00:01:31.67,00:01:31.67,"and that, when it wasn't even her place to be there."
33,00:01:34.75,00:01:34.75,>> PROBST: At Tribal Council... >> Sylvia is used to dictating
34,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,and telling people what to do. >> PROBST: ...Sylvia's
35,00:01:39.12,00:01:39.12,personality was scrutinized. >> You have a habit of
36,00:01:41.29,00:01:41.29,"kind of throwing out an idea and saying, ""Let's do it,"" and not"
37,00:01:43.92,00:01:43.92,actually talking with anybody. >> PROBST: But it was Erica
38,00:01:46.25,00:01:46.25,"whose torch was snuffed. Erica, the tribe has spoken."
39,00:01:51.17,00:01:51.17,17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,">> The two back-to-back losses have really affected us, and"
41,00:02:14.17,00:02:14.17,this last Tribal Council was very brutal.
42,00:02:17.08,00:02:17.08,We came to a realization that we are quite... not quite
43,00:02:21.71,00:02:21.71,connected together yet as a tribe.
44,00:02:24.17,00:02:24.17,">> First thing in the morning, let's cut some coconuts, get"
45,00:02:26.04,00:02:26.04,"some... get hydrated, cut some pineapples."
46,00:02:28.96,00:02:28.96,">> I would like to, if I see big sun, if I could try and"
47,00:02:32.96,00:02:32.96,"start a fire. >> Yeah, I'll be out there on"
48,00:02:35.21,00:02:35.21,"the beach with you, too, with some glasses."
49,00:02:37.04,00:02:37.04,>> Being the biggest group of losers that Survivor has ever
50,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,seen sucks! It's no fun.
51,00:02:41.75,00:02:41.75,We can't win challenges right now; I don't know what it is.
52,00:02:44.12,00:02:44.12,"I don't know if they put, like, a jinx on us or a curse,"
53,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,but we just can't win right now. Let's say we do have a challenge
54,00:02:48.96,00:02:48.96,"tomorrow, okay? I'm not telling you what to do."
55,00:02:52.12,00:02:52.12,I'm just throwing out a suggestion.
56,00:02:54.12,00:02:54.12,"Maybe... maybe, like, somebody could just-- not even take"
57,00:02:57.08,00:02:57.08,charge-- just one person can talk at a time.
58,00:02:59.04,00:02:59.04,"When everybody talks over each other, it doesn't work."
59,00:03:00.71,00:03:00.71,">> Right. >> At this point, we still have"
60,00:03:03.79,00:03:03.79,"the desire to win, but we really need to get our act"
61,00:03:06.58,00:03:06.58,together and have a good strategy going in.
62,00:03:09.25,00:03:09.25,">> Let's put egos aside and put tribe and winning first, and"
63,00:03:12.75,00:03:12.75,"just, you know, have... We've got to try."
64,00:03:15.83,00:03:15.83,">> The more we lose, the more difficult it is to recover."
65,00:03:28.04,00:03:28.04,(theme song playing) >> This is going to dry real
66,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,"quick. >> Looks nice, huh?"
67,00:04:47.33,00:04:47.33,>> It's pretty. >> I like it.
68,00:04:49.29,00:04:49.29,>> Lisi suggested that we paint the floor to kind of seal up the
69,00:04:51.71,00:04:51.71,wood to prevent the ants from coming in.
70,00:04:54.12,00:04:54.12,"It will look nice, but there's  a function to it."
71,00:04:57.04,00:04:57.04,">> It looks pretty, but it wasn't done with the intention"
72,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,for aesthetics. I'll bet the ant lines are going
73,00:05:01.08,00:05:01.08,"to be a lot less tonight. >> Hurry, hurry, to the pot."
74,00:05:06.75,00:05:06.75,">> Very good. >> Oh, they're perfect."
75,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,">> This is going too great. >> Yeah. It's, like, too good to"
76,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,"be true, man. >> We gotta take a poll."
77,00:05:13.46,00:05:13.46,">> Are we really on Survivor, or are we dreaming?"
78,00:05:18.08,00:05:18.08,">> We're just having a party out here, really."
79,00:05:20.17,00:05:20.17,"We're telling jokes, lounging around on a hammock."
80,00:05:23.04,00:05:23.04,We don't have to win anything else as far as survival.
81,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,"It's not even survival. It's ""thrive-al."""
82,00:05:30.12,00:05:30.12,>> I really wouldn't be surprised if the people on the
83,00:05:32.58,00:05:32.58,other side just started dropping like flies because they
84,00:05:34.54,00:05:34.54,"just don't seem to be catching a break, man."
85,00:05:57.54,00:05:57.54,>> Big Earl! >> Ravu!
86,00:06:00.71,00:06:00.71,>> Welcome home! >> You guys got a fire?
87,00:06:03.88,00:06:03.88,">> No. The sun, we seen it today, man."
88,00:06:05.79,00:06:05.79,">> But you got some water, sweetie?"
89,00:06:08.00,00:06:08.00,">> I'm back from Exile Island. The first thing they asked me,"
90,00:06:10.83,00:06:10.83,"""Do you have water?"" It was like walking on the"
91,00:06:13.42,00:06:13.42,beach to a bunch of begging children.
92,00:06:16.42,00:06:16.42,>> Was the clue really obscure? >> The clue is interesting.
93,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,"As far as the immunity idol, I sure have no idea where it is."
94,00:06:26.71,00:06:26.71,"I mean, I don't know how it really works, with the clue"
95,00:06:29.71,00:06:29.71,"thing, like, I mean, you guys probably know more than I do."
96,00:06:32.04,00:06:32.04,"I mean, I have to give more thought, and really survey the"
97,00:06:34.25,00:06:34.25,land. It's under something that's
98,00:06:36.71,00:06:36.71,"high, and it can be anywhere, but I'll figure something out."
99,00:06:40.62,00:06:40.62,"Losing-- it hurts. Yeah, I mean, come on."
100,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,"It's, like, no fire again? We're trying to take advantage"
101,00:06:48.96,00:06:48.96,"of any of this sun or are we just, like, dead?"
102,00:06:51.62,00:06:51.62,>> Now we're waiting for the point where it gets up high
103,00:06:53.33,00:06:53.33,"enough. >> Dear Sun, Michelle would"
104,00:06:58.08,00:06:58.08,like you to come out and play today.
105,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,"Please participate in my game. Sincerely, Michelle."
106,00:07:04.42,00:07:04.42,>> It's coming out. It's going to come out.
107,00:07:06.33,00:07:06.33,">> Yeah. We haven't had fire, so I"
108,00:07:10.71,00:07:10.71,decided to just go out and give it a go while we have some sun.
109,00:07:17.00,00:07:17.00,"The sun's moving fast, oh, geez. Using glasses to start a fire"
110,00:07:22.75,00:07:22.75,"is absolutely possible. I started to pray, because I"
111,00:07:27.54,00:07:27.54,know my momma doesn't want me to die out here.
112,00:07:32.88,00:07:32.88,"Come on. Burn, baby, burn."
113,00:07:40.46,00:07:40.46,Whoo! I looked down about a minute
114,00:07:43.38,00:07:43.38,"and a half later, and I see the start of a fire, so I go running"
115,00:07:47.79,00:07:47.79,"back to the beach. First person I see is Anthony,"
116,00:07:50.21,00:07:50.21,"and I hand that off to him. I'm, like, ""Start a fire with"
117,00:07:53.04,00:07:53.04,"this."" >> Fire!"
118,00:07:55.04,00:07:55.04,>> Fire? >> Help.
119,00:07:55.96,00:07:55.96,">> Oh, here, here, here, here. >> I got to go."
120,00:07:57.21,00:07:57.21,"Where am I going? >> Oh, my God."
121,00:07:58.88,00:07:58.88,>> There you go. >> Give me some tinders.
122,00:08:01.79,00:08:01.79,">> Somebody blow, somebody blow. Gentle, gentle."
123,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,"Anything you got here, get it going, come on."
124,00:08:09.25,00:08:09.25,(cheering) >> Awesome.
125,00:08:18.00,00:08:18.00,"(cheering, whooping) >> We're not gonna die."
126,00:08:23.21,00:08:23.21,">> We've been struggling a long time, and now we finally got a"
127,00:08:25.62,00:08:25.62,"shot in the ass that we needed, so I think it's going to be a"
128,00:08:28.00,00:08:28.00,good day. I'd be scared to be the other
129,00:08:30.08,00:08:30.08,"team right now because we're, we're just so fired up, it's"
130,00:08:32.67,00:08:32.67,"ridiculous. >> PROBST: Moto, come on in."
131,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,"Ravu, come on in. Moto, getting your first look at"
132,00:08:47.33,00:08:47.33,the new Ravu tribe. Erica voted out at the last
133,00:08:51.12,00:08:51.12,"Tribal Council. Ravu, last time I talked to you"
134,00:08:59.46,00:08:59.46,"guys, life was not enjoyable. Rocky, things still tough over"
135,00:09:03.38,00:09:03.38,"there? >> Uh, things are tough, but,"
136,00:09:05.58,00:09:05.58,"but they're getting better. My, uh, my girl Michelle over"
137,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,here started a fire today... boiled some water; things are
138,00:09:11.17,00:09:11.17,looking up. >> PROBST: You started fire?
139,00:09:13.42,00:09:13.42,">> Yes. >> Michelle did, yes, we did."
140,00:09:15.12,00:09:15.12,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Ravu, I got to say"
141,00:09:16.67,00:09:16.67,you have done what very few tribes have ever done in this
142,00:09:20.92,00:09:20.92,"game, which is start fire on your own."
143,00:09:23.38,00:09:23.38,"Congratulations. Because you have fire, you no"
144,00:09:25.25,00:09:25.25,longer have to earn it. Here's your flint.
145,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,"(cheering) You now have your flint, same as"
146,00:09:30.67,00:09:30.67,"Moto. Hopefully, you'll be able to"
147,00:09:32.67,00:09:32.67,"keep your fire going. All right, for today's reward"
148,00:09:36.08,00:09:36.08,"challenge, you will race head- to-head as you slide down a"
149,00:09:39.79,00:09:39.79,slippery course to retrieve a numbered ball that I will
150,00:09:43.92,00:09:43.92,randomly assign each round. First tribe member to toss your
151,00:09:48.08,00:09:48.08,ball into a basket scores a point for their tribe.
152,00:09:51.25,00:09:51.25,First tribe to six wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
153,00:09:54.29,00:09:54.29,for? >> ALL: Yeah!
154,00:09:56.12,00:09:56.12,>> PROBST: You will have a choice.
155,00:09:57.96,00:09:57.96,First reward you might choose is a little taste of home in the
156,00:10:01.29,00:10:01.29,form of your luxury items. >> Wow.
157,00:10:05.08,00:10:05.08,>> PROBST: If that's not whetting your appetite...
158,00:10:09.00,00:10:09.00,"(gasping, murmuring) ...an exact duplicate set of the"
159,00:10:13.79,00:10:13.79,fishing gear that Moto won. If you don't like either of
160,00:10:16.54,00:10:16.54,"those, third choice: instant gratification-- fresh fruit."
161,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,"In addition, the winning tribe will send one member from the"

163,00:10:30.08,00:10:30.08,will not be immune. They will rejoin their tribe
164,00:10:33.67,00:10:33.67,"before the next challenge. Moto, because you have one extra"
165,00:10:35.67,00:10:35.67,"member, you're sitting somebody out."

171,00:10:56.88,00:10:56.88,Survivors ready? Go!

270,00:17:48.29,00:17:48.29,This is the second time I've been separated from my tribe in
271,00:17:50.92,00:17:50.92,"only seven days, and they're probably sitting around and"
272,00:17:54.12,00:17:54.12,"saying, ""We should've let Sylvia go sooner 'cause she's a real"

276,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,Interesting. The third clue is so helpful.
277,00:18:14.12,00:18:14.12,"It said, dig right under the tallest part of the arch of the"
278,00:18:17.00,00:18:17.00,"cave, and the immunity idol will be there."
279,00:18:21.12,00:18:21.12,I'm in a... probably the most tenuous position right now with
280,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,my tribe. The idol is right smack-dab in
281,00:18:29.12,00:18:29.12,"the middle of camp, so I need to figure out a time and a place to"
282,00:18:33.00,00:18:33.00,look for the idol as quickly as possible.
283,00:18:38.62,00:18:38.62,>> SEVERAL (chanting): Moto! Moto! Moto!

286,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,"even women and the children. >> I loved that challenge,"
287,00:18:50.38,00:18:50.38,seeing people slip and fall. >> I am so happy we got this.
288,00:18:54.12,00:18:54.12,">> And as long as we keep the lead, our morale stays up,"
289,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,"their morale goes down-- bam, there it is right there, that"
290,00:19:00.71,00:19:00.71,"whole game, every time. So funny when Papa Smurf"
291,00:19:03.21,00:19:03.21,fell down. (laughter)
292,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,">> That was funny. >> When he fell down, I was,"
293,00:19:08.21,00:19:08.21,"like, ""Golly!"" >> Who?"
294,00:19:10.62,00:19:10.62,">> Papa Smurf. >> I've busted ribs before, and"
295,00:19:28.12,00:19:28.12,"it feels like I... just like when I broke that one, can't get"
296,00:19:30.38,00:19:30.38,"a deep breath. Just... had some dizziness, uh,"
297,00:19:33.67,00:19:33.67,"before, where I kind of just... and it feels like it's the same"
298,00:19:37.54,00:19:37.54,"thing. >> We were all sitting around,"
299,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,"and all of a sudden, you know, we noticed Gary wasn't doing"
300,00:19:42.50,00:19:42.50,too well. He took a pretty hard fall in
301,00:19:44.96,00:19:44.96,"the challenge, so, you know, we were just concerned."
302,00:19:48.92,00:19:48.92,So we got the medics to come out here and take a look at him.
303,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,">> Is it hard for you to talk? >> No, no."
304,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,>> Yeah... okay. >> And that's... I don't know...
305,00:20:40.25,00:20:40.25,>> He was afraid. He said he didn't want to die
306,00:20:42.67,00:20:42.67,in Fiji. And that he was real afraid.
307,00:20:47.00,00:20:47.00,He couldn't-- he didn't know where he was.
308,00:20:50.25,00:20:50.25,I know this is a passion for him.
309,00:20:52.83,00:20:52.83,"A lot of people look at it as a game, but he's older."
310,00:20:57.33,00:20:57.33,And I just want him to be okay. >> Yeah.
311,00:21:32.67,00:21:32.67,>> See if that helps you. >> Okay.
312,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,>> Will that be all right? >> Yes.
313,00:21:37.88,00:21:37.88,>> All righty? >> Yes.
314,00:21:40.67,00:21:40.67,">> The plan for now is to have Gary just rest for a while, see"
315,00:21:44.71,00:21:44.71,how he wakes up in the morning. >> Thank you.
316,00:21:47.21,00:21:47.21,>> Take care. >> But my thinking is if he
317,00:21:50.38,00:21:50.38,"cannot breathe, you know, it's..."
318,00:21:53.42,00:21:53.42,It's best for him to just go and get that taken care of.
319,00:22:03.12,00:22:03.12,>> Yeah. >> Gary's a great guy.
320,00:22:04.75,00:22:04.75,"I mean, we all kind of look up to the guy, and, you know, he's"
321,00:22:06.92,00:22:06.92,"in our prayers, and we just hope he gets better."
322,00:22:21.00,00:22:21.00,>> Tree mail! Come and get it!
323,00:22:23.29,00:22:23.29,>> We've got mail? >> Yep.
324,00:22:25.04,00:22:25.04,">> ""Keeping your tribe together won't require brawn."
325,00:22:28.33,00:22:28.33,"This one is a true test of will, and now it's time to get"

327,00:22:33.79,00:22:33.79,">> No, it won't require brawn. It's endurance."

329,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,Don't know what it entails. It's kind of hard to speculate
330,00:22:42.08,00:22:42.08,"because, in this game, when you think it's going one way, all"
331,00:22:44.67,00:22:44.67,"of a sudden, it goes the other. >> Gary showing up to the next"
332,00:22:53.17,00:22:53.17,challenge in this sort of weakened position is going to
333,00:22:55.75,00:22:55.75,"hurt our tribe, so if it's going to be the case that he's"
334,00:22:58.21,00:22:58.21,"just not going to be able to perform, then it's in his best"
335,00:23:01.04,00:23:01.04,"interest, as well as ours, to just-- he should just call it"

377,00:25:46.79,00:25:46.79,Very close. Got to show me a completely
378,00:25:48.58,00:25:48.58,empty mouth. Who can swallow fastest?
379,00:25:53.54,00:25:53.54,Sylvia got a little nub on there.
380,00:25:55.21,00:25:55.21,Don't lose it. Dre has it for Moto!
381,00:26:01.00,00:26:01.00,We are tied one-one. Next round is Lisi taking on
382,00:26:05.71,00:26:05.71,Mookie. Peanut worms.
383,00:26:14.50,00:26:14.50,Moto leads two-one. You're playing to five.

391,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,Come on! >> You're good.
392,00:26:41.29,00:26:41.29,"One more, baby, one more! >> PROBST: Mookie taunting"
393,00:26:44.67,00:26:44.67,"Lisi, trying to get her to vomit."
394,00:26:49.00,00:26:49.00,Trying to get her to throw up. Mookie very close for Ravu.
395,00:26:54.62,00:26:54.62,">> Show me the money, Mook! Show me the money, Mook."
396,00:26:58.12,00:26:58.12,>> PROBST: Mookie has it for Ravu!
397,00:27:01.38,00:27:01.38,Ravu leads two-one. >> Was it nasty?
398,00:27:05.92,00:27:05.92,>> It was nasty. >> PROBST: You didn't like the
399,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,"taunting? >> Well, no, not at all."
400,00:27:10.88,00:27:10.88,"I mean, that-- that might have just have stopped our goodwill"
401,00:27:13.50,00:27:13.50,towards them. Goodwill and sportsmanship is
402,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,"to be humble. >> You guys taunt, too, bro."
403,00:27:20.96,00:27:20.96,"It's not one-sided brother. >> We don't taunt, and we still"
404,00:27:23.29,00:27:23.29,wish all the best of luck. >> I wish you the best of
405,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,"luck too, but it's all fair in love and war, baby."
406,00:27:28.08,00:27:28.08,Chill out; relax. You blow off two people and
407,00:27:30.25,00:27:30.25,"then tell me how you feel, bro. >> PROBST: Ready to keep going?"
408,00:27:34.67,00:27:34.67,>> Yeah. >> Please.

436,00:28:58.75,00:28:58.75,"That's all right, baby. >> PROBST: This could be the"
437,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,last round. It's going to be Papa Smurf
438,00:29:06.08,00:29:06.08,"for Moto, taking on Anthony for Ravu."
439,00:29:09.83,00:29:09.83,"A lot on the line. Gary, you could win immunity"
440,00:29:12.50,00:29:12.50,"again for Moto. Anthony, fate is in your hands."
441,00:29:17.21,00:29:17.21,You have to win or you guys are going to Tribal Council tonight.
442,00:29:24.79,00:29:24.79,Let's see how you do with pig snouts.
443,00:29:29.25,00:29:29.25,Still a little hair on the snout.
444,00:29:33.92,00:29:33.92,">> Come on, baby! >> Bacon, baby, bacon."
445,00:29:37.38,00:29:37.38,">> PROBST: Three, two, one, eat. >> Come on, Papa!"
446,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,>> Papa Smurf! >> Papa.
447,00:29:45.21,00:29:45.21,">> Let's go, Anthony! >> PROBST: Gary like he's"
448,00:29:47.21,00:29:47.21,done it every day of his life. Hammering that snout down.
449,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,Anthony struggling to get it down.
450,00:29:54.12,00:29:54.12,">> Hey, you don't got to chew all of it."
451,00:29:55.92,00:29:55.92,"You don't got to chew all of it. Just swallow, baby."
452,00:29:57.62,00:29:57.62,">> We're behind, baby, come on! Chew fast!"
453,00:30:00.62,00:30:00.62,>> PROBST: Papa Smurf starting on his second snout.
454,00:30:04.04,00:30:04.04,">> Come on, Papa Smurf. >> PROBST: Anthony has really"
455,00:30:07.21,00:30:07.21,slowed down his chewing. >> Come on Anthony!
456,00:30:10.25,00:30:10.25,>> TEAM (chanting): Papa Smurf! >> PROBST: Gary puts down the
457,00:30:14.38,00:30:14.38,the last bite. Anthony still struggling with
458,00:30:17.96,00:30:17.96,that first bite. >> TEAM: Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!
459,00:30:21.67,00:30:21.67,Papa Smurf! >> PROBST: Moto wins immunity
460,00:30:24.58,00:30:24.58,again! Moto remains undefeated so far
461,00:30:38.58,00:30:38.58,"in this game. Ravu, still winless, more bad"
462,00:30:42.00,00:30:42.00,"news, Tribal Council tonight. Another member of your tribe"
463,00:30:45.12,00:30:45.12,"going home. Grab your bags, head back to"
464,00:30:47.83,00:30:47.83,camp. See you at Tribal.
465,00:31:01.62,00:31:01.62,"(squawking, chittering) >> (yells)"
466,00:31:05.50,00:31:05.50,We lost again. >> That was a tough challenge.
467,00:31:09.04,00:31:09.04,Hey. >> Four times in a row is hard.
468,00:31:12.29,00:31:12.29,What are you gonna do? >> I just want to let you guys
469,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,"know I was absolutely mortified yesterday by my performance,"
470,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,okay? I just wanted to say I'm really
471,00:31:20.25,00:31:20.25,sorry that I let the team down on that one challenge.
472,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,">> If, at the moment, that was the best you can do, then..."
473,00:31:26.67,00:31:26.67,">> Okay, thanks for letting me get it off my chest."
474,00:31:28.83,00:31:28.83,(indistinct chatter) I don't know if the tribe is
475,00:31:31.33,00:31:31.33,still connected to me. I certainly still feel connected
476,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,to the tribe. But I was gone for almost 24
477,00:31:38.29,00:31:38.29,"hours, and... I've been a target since first day."
478,00:31:43.08,00:31:43.08,"Because I'm definitely the oldest woman, and the least"
479,00:31:47.42,00:31:47.42,"amount of strength, probably the least amount of skills."
480,00:31:50.92,00:31:50.92,It is absolutely essential that I find the idol before Tribal
481,00:31:54.46,00:31:54.46,"Council, or else I will be the next one voted off."
482,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,>> She's trying a bit too hard. >> I'm right there with you.
483,00:32:13.08,00:32:13.08,I'm just trying to keep my butt in the game.
484,00:32:15.08,00:32:15.08,I'm trying not to scramble around too much.
485,00:32:18.25,00:32:18.25,I think that Sylvia's getting voted out tonight.
486,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,Probably the most interesting complication that can happen
487,00:32:24.83,00:32:24.83,during Tribal Council will be if Sylvia actually has the idol.
488,00:32:29.25,00:32:29.25,"And if she breaks it out, it's gonna change up some..."
489,00:32:32.42,00:32:32.42,everything. Because whoever she picks...
490,00:32:36.62,00:32:36.62,"goes home. >> So, let's run over what we're"
491,00:32:39.67,00:32:39.67,"gonna do tonight, huh? >> Um..."
492,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,">> Sylvia's... Basically, the majority, uh, is gonna vote for"
493,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,"Sylvia on this one, all right? >> Okay. Mm-hmm."
494,00:32:47.75,00:32:47.75,">> And then, to back it up, just in case she does have the idol--"
495,00:32:50.29,00:32:50.29,"'cause, you know, she's playing off like she doesn't, but not a"
496,00:32:53.12,00:32:53.12,"big deal-- we'll put Anthony's name in there, too, 'cause we..."
497,00:32:56.25,00:32:56.25,>> So we have a backup. >> Yeah. Cool?
498,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,">> Sounds like a plan. >> Ready, break?"
499,00:33:01.08,00:33:01.08,"Ready, break. All right. >> James approached me and said"
500,00:33:03.75,00:33:03.75,that the plan was that Sylvia was gonna be voted out unless
501,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,"she had the immunity idol, and, then, in which case, we would be"
502,00:33:11.75,00:33:11.75,"voting, uh, Anthony out. >> Does he irk you at all, or"
503,00:33:14.75,00:33:14.75,no? Yeah.
504,00:33:21.29,00:33:21.29,He just seems like a... like a... like a... a little on the
505,00:33:23.96,00:33:23.96,"whiny side, you know? >> Well, like, he's so"
506,00:33:25.71,00:33:25.71,wishy-washy. >> Yeah.
507,00:33:27.71,00:33:27.71,>> I don't want to vote out either Sylvia or Anthony.
508,00:33:31.17,00:33:31.17,"We've made our voting decisions, supposedly, to try to make the"
509,00:33:34.17,00:33:34.17,"tribe stronger, but the reality is that it hasn't."
510,00:33:38.17,00:33:38.17,"So I'm gonna do something that's not ""with the tribe."""
511,00:33:46.12,00:33:46.12,">> Anthony, he's... he's the most, you know..."
512,00:33:49.00,00:33:49.00,I don't know what's going on in his mind.
513,00:33:50.38,00:33:50.38,"And especially today, when someone puts a gun to your head,"
514,00:33:52.67,00:33:52.67,"""Finish this in a minute."" I don't care if you have no"
515,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,"water in your mouth, you're going to finish it."
516,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67,"He was still on the same little bit, and then he's, like,"
517,00:33:59.08,00:33:59.08,"complaining about it. >> That bothered you, huh?"
518,00:34:01.33,00:34:01.33,>> This bit! Anthony just... I was not happy
519,00:34:05.04,00:34:05.04,at all with his performance in the challenge.
520,00:34:07.38,00:34:07.38,"He's just not that strong, and I think it's just the effort that"
521,00:34:10.08,00:34:10.08,he put forward that just really irritated me.
522,00:34:13.96,00:34:13.96,"So, uh... >> Mm-hmm?"
523,00:34:15.79,00:34:15.79,>> Where's Anthony? >> Not around.
524,00:34:18.96,00:34:18.96,">> So you're good with that, Sylvia?"
525,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,">> Mm-hmm, yeah. >> Okay."
526,00:34:24.12,00:34:24.12,>> I'm good. I'm not sure how it's going to
527,00:34:27.92,00:34:27.92,"go tonight. I mean, I hear, supposedly, that"
528,00:34:30.79,00:34:30.79,"majority is going to vote for Anthony, but I'm not feeling"
529,00:34:35.00,00:34:35.00,really absolutely certain. I am pretty sure I know where
530,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,the idol is. From the three clues that have
531,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50,"been given out so far, it seems to me that it's going to be at"
532,00:34:46.96,00:34:46.96,the threshold of the tallest point of the cave.
533,00:34:53.21,00:34:53.21,"So I still have a little bit of time before Tribal Council, and"
534,00:34:56.42,00:34:56.42,I'm going to dig right now and try to get that idol as my
535,00:34:59.42,00:34:59.42,"insurance policy. If I get the idol now, and if"
536,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,"the vote does go my way, I will be able to surprise everybody."
537,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,">> PROBST: Let's start with a quick poll, one word answers."
538,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50,What is the state of the tribe? Anthony.
539,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,>> Tired. >> PROBST: Yau-Man.
540,00:35:40.71,00:35:40.71,>> Not very happy. >> PROBST: Michelle.
541,00:35:43.04,00:35:43.04,>> Hungry. >> PROBST: Rocky.
542,00:35:44.79,00:35:44.79,>> Tired. >> PROBST: Mookie.
543,00:35:46.54,00:35:46.54,>> Bad. >> PROBST: I'm watching a group
544,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,"of people that are disintegrating, emotionally,"
545,00:35:51.17,00:35:51.17,"before my eyes. Mookie, what needs to happen"
546,00:35:54.58,00:35:54.58,with this tribe? The game is slipping through
547,00:35:57.08,00:35:57.08,your fingers. >> We need to come through in a
548,00:35:59.21,00:35:59.21,"challenge. Uh, I think the more we lose,"
549,00:36:00.92,00:36:00.92,"the idea the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, comes"
550,00:36:03.62,00:36:03.62,"to seep into our minds, and, uh, it's starting to mess with"
551,00:36:06.42,00:36:06.42,"us, definitely. >> PROBST: Sylvia, you struggled"
552,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,in the reward challenge. >> I did.
553,00:36:11.75,00:36:11.75,"I mean, I was just mortified for disappointing the tribe, for not"
554,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83,getting that one more basket in. The second thing was a little
555,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,bit of self-performance here: why are you not able to do the
556,00:36:22.92,00:36:22.92,clutch move when you need to do it?
557,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,">> PROBST: Anthony, today, you squared off against Gary-- Papa"
558,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,Smurf. The head-to-head between you two
559,00:36:32.79,00:36:32.79,"guys was over before it started. >> I was just trying to swallow,"
560,00:36:36.62,00:36:36.62,"and I had no spit to swallow. You know, I was out here in the"
561,00:36:39.96,00:36:39.96,tropics chewing pig snout and enjoying it.
562,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,"I just couldn't swallow it. >> PROBST: Rocky, trust."
563,00:36:46.25,00:36:46.25,"Does it start to become even more difficult, when you lose"
564,00:36:49.58,00:36:49.58,"time after time after time, to trust people?"
565,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,>> I think it becomes more important.
566,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,You have to trust that there is a possibility that one day you
567,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,are going to snap out of this and you're going to start
568,00:36:57.83,00:36:57.83,"winning. If you lose that, you might as"

570,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,">> PROBST: Anthony, Mookie trustworthy?"
571,00:37:05.88,00:37:05.88,>> I think Mookie is pretty trustworthy.
572,00:37:07.62,00:37:07.62,"I'm generally the person who, for the most part, gives people"
573,00:37:10.62,00:37:10.62,the benefit of the doubt. >> PROBST: The problem with that
574,00:37:12.67,00:37:12.67,"is, by the time you figure out you can't trust him, it could be"
575,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,"as you're walking out of here. >> You know, I often wonder"
576,00:37:18.25,00:37:18.25,if the... if these folks even like me.
577,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,"I think... I like to think they like me, but you know, sometimes"
578,00:37:22.62,00:37:22.62,"you can't tell. >> PROBST: Mookie, what's your"
579,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"thought on what Anthony said? >> To be honest, after the"
580,00:37:28.62,00:37:28.62,"challenge, I was really pissed off."
581,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,And one person that just brought me over the top was Anthony.
582,00:37:36.00,00:37:36.00,"I understand that it's hard to swallow, but when you take a"
583,00:37:39.17,00:37:39.17,"little piece of snout this small, you can will yourself to"
584,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,"throw it down. >> PROBST: Anthony, he's not"
585,00:37:45.25,00:37:45.25,"only saying you didn't have enough effort today, he's"
586,00:37:47.12,00:37:47.12,questioning your will to win. >> I have the will to win.
587,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,I have the will to be here. I have the will to keep going
588,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,through this game. I'm out there in the same stuff
589,00:37:55.96,00:37:55.96,"with you, dude. I guess I pissed you off."
590,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,"Okay, fine. But, you know, you want to"
591,00:38:00.62,00:38:00.62,question my will... >> I don't... I don't want to
592,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,make it personal. The thing is...
593,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,">> Well, you know, it's gonna be personal."
594,00:38:05.00,00:38:05.00,>> Not everyone was able to put it down.
595,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,">> Well, apparently I'm the only one who put you over the top."
596,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,>> PROBST: One last topic to talk about: hidden immunity
597,00:38:13.08,00:38:13.08,"idol. Earl's been out there once,"
598,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,Sylvia twice. What was the mood back at camp
599,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,"today, Rocky, knowing she had three clues?"
600,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,Were you trying to figure out if she had the idol or not?
601,00:38:23.75,00:38:23.75,>> Of course we are. She could be holding it in her
602,00:38:25.92,00:38:25.92,back pocket right now. I don't know.
603,00:38:28.62,00:38:28.62,">> PROBST: Okay, if somebody does indeed have the hidden"
604,00:38:31.25,00:38:31.25,"immunity idol and you want to play it, you would play it after"
605,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,"the votes have been cast, before I read them."
606,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,"It is time to vote. Mookie, you're up."
607,00:38:46.54,00:38:46.54,>> It's not your will. It's your attitude.
608,00:39:02.96,00:39:02.96,>> I just got to know if you have the idol or not.
609,00:39:31.29,00:39:31.29,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
610,00:39:42.25,00:39:42.25,>> PROBST: If you have the hidden immunity idol and you
611,00:39:44.38,00:39:44.38,"want to play it, now is the time to do so."
612,00:39:56.12,00:39:56.12,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
613,00:39:58.54,00:39:58.54,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
614,00:40:00.29,00:40:00.29,"Council area immediately. First vote, Sylvia."

625,00:41:29.58,00:41:29.58,that came out of tonight's Tribal Council: a little
626,00:41:32.46,00:41:32.46,honesty. Maybe it will make a difference.
627,00:41:35.21,00:41:35.21,Grab your torches. Go back to camp.
628,00:41:48.50,00:41:48.50,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

632,00:42:00.67,00:42:00.67,"getting worse. >> If he doesn't get better,"
633,00:42:02.04,00:42:02.04,he's going to have to go. >> PROBST: Liliana makes a move
634,00:42:04.17,00:42:04.17,on the guys. (laughing)
635,00:42:07.83,00:42:07.83,And Anthony takes a beating. >> You get all sentimental and
636,00:42:11.12,00:42:11.12,sensitive. >> There's no way in hell I'm
637,00:42:12.71,00:42:12.71,"gonna give it up. >> So I've been had, and, um,"
638,00:42:21.83,00:42:21.83,"I'm not too happy about it. Um, I actually really, really"
639,00:42:24.88,00:42:24.88,liked the entire group of both tribes because we had three days
640,00:42:27.92,00:42:27.92,"to get to know everybody, and I'm not that angry or resentful"
641,00:42:31.75,00:42:31.75,right now. I'm just looking forward to
642,00:42:34.08,00:42:34.08,seeing them all after they've clawed each other's eyes out
643,00:42:37.00,00:42:37.00,later on.
