2,00:00:04.38,00:00:04.38,on Survivor... James found the second hidden
3,00:00:07.33,00:00:07.33,immunity idol at Zhan Hu. >> I have it now.
4,00:00:10.08,00:00:10.08,I have it in my possession. I'm on Survivor with two idols.
5,00:00:16.96,00:00:16.96,">> JEFF: Erik found the plaque James discarded, and Jaime"
6,00:00:19.54,00:00:19.54,suspected it might be an immunity idol.
7,00:00:21.67,00:00:21.67,">> If I play the hidden immunity idol tonight, it's probably"
8,00:00:23.79,00:00:23.79,"going to shock everyone. I'm not as dumb as I look, and"
9,00:00:26.04,00:00:26.04,"maybe they're figuring it out. >> JEFF: The next day, the two"
10,00:00:28.96,00:00:28.96,tribes merged... Drop your buffs.
11,00:00:32.04,00:00:32.04,You are merged. ...and enjoyed a celebration

13,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,guys. >> Beef.
14,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,>> Beef. >> Whoa!
15,00:00:42.17,00:00:42.17,Easy! >> Jeff's here!
16,00:00:45.79,00:00:45.79,>> JEFF: What up? In an unexpected challenge...
17,00:00:48.38,00:00:48.38,You will be tested on your recollection of events that
18,00:00:51.08,00:00:51.08,happened during the feast and the celebration.
19,00:00:54.25,00:00:54.25,Frosti was the first to win individual immunity.
20,00:00:58.25,00:00:58.25,The former Zhan Hu were outnumbered by the former Fei
21,00:01:00.92,00:01:00.92,Long. >> Now all we have to do is put
22,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,the nails in the coffin and bury them.
23,00:01:06.04,00:01:06.04,">> JEFF: Convinced they had a hidden idol, Jaime and Erik"
24,00:01:08.21,00:01:08.21,planned to use it to get rid of Jean-Robert.
25,00:01:18.62,00:01:18.62,">> JEFF: At tribal council, I-/////!ll read the votes."
26,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,Jaime played the idol while a shocked Jean-Robert looked on.
27,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,"The rules of Survivor state if the immunity idol is played, any"
28,00:01:30.88,00:01:30.88,"votes cast against that person will not count, and the person"
29,00:01:34.46,00:01:34.46,with the next highest number of votes will be sent home.
30,00:01:37.92,00:01:37.92,"This, however, is not a hidden immunity idol."
31,00:01:41.42,00:01:41.42,">> Oh, my gosh! >> JEFF: Jaime, Erik, and Peih-"
32,00:01:44.04,00:01:44.04,Gee voted for Jean-Robert. But the former members of Fei
33,00:01:47.62,00:01:47.62,"Long stuck together, and Jaime became the first member of the"
34,00:01:50.96,00:01:50.96,jury. Nine are left.
35,00:01:53.71,00:01:53.71,Who will be voted out tonight? >> I know.
36,00:02:09.33,00:02:09.33,"I was, like, terrified. I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."""
37,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,">> I mean, I knew 100% I'm going home."
38,00:02:12.88,00:02:12.88,"At tribal council, I had a close call."
39,00:02:16.04,00:02:16.04,Jaime pulled this little plaque out of her bag.
40,00:02:18.50,00:02:18.50,"I mean, I was like, ""Is this really happening?"
41,00:02:21.75,00:02:21.75,Could this possibly be that she found an individual immunity
42,00:02:25.25,00:02:25.25,"idol somewhere in our camp?"" >> Before you get in bed, Erik"
43,00:02:29.21,00:02:29.21,"has to go back there. >> Well, just move over!"
44,00:02:32.21,00:02:32.21,Move over. What the hell?
45,00:02:37.96,00:02:37.96,"Well, goodness gracious, sakes alive."
46,00:02:42.04,00:02:42.04,">> You wouldn't want to move. So shut up, James."
47,00:02:53.12,00:02:53.12,( laughter ) >> Jean Robert don't know that I
48,00:02:56.58,00:02:56.58,"have both immunity idols. We can't tell him that, because"
49,00:02:58.92,00:02:58.92,it's Jean-Robert. He's going to mess something up.
50,00:03:01.67,00:03:01.67,We just need to keep his dumb ass in line just because we're
51,00:03:03.50,00:03:03.50,"stuck with him now. We need his vote, so we have to"
52,00:03:05.62,00:03:05.62,deal with it.  Captioning sponsored by

55,00:04:22.12,00:04:22.12,"tribemates, and we have to stick together."
56,00:04:25.50,00:04:25.50,We put ourselves in a position by all these personalities
57,00:04:28.21,00:04:28.21,coming together. We're complete opposites.
58,00:04:31.08,00:04:31.08,"I mean we've got a lunch lady, we have a professional gambler,"
59,00:04:34.25,00:04:34.25,"we have a stewardess, We have a waitress from New"
60,00:04:36.96,00:04:36.96,York. There's a gravedigger.
61,00:04:38.83,00:04:38.83,"All our personalities, even though we clash, we pull"
62,00:04:41.12,00:04:41.12,"together, and we've won together, you know?"
63,00:04:43.96,00:04:43.96,"And the other team, that's not how they work."
64,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,"The other team, they got together as a clique."
65,00:04:48.08,00:04:48.08,They're not trying to win a million dollars.
66,00:04:49.71,00:04:49.71,They were trying to win the high school friend contest.
67,00:04:59.08,00:04:59.08,"I just got two of them, because they're catching too fast."
68,00:05:01.62,00:05:01.62,">> Oh, my god! >> Oh, my god!"
69,00:05:04.25,00:05:04.25,>> Wow! >> That is beautiful!
70,00:05:06.92,00:05:06.92,"At this moment, James is in a very good position, because he"
71,00:05:10.25,00:05:10.25,"has both immunity idols for sure, so he's almost guaranteed"
72,00:05:14.29,00:05:14.29,himself in a top five position right now.
73,00:05:21.04,00:05:21.04,"He's a strong physical, mental player of this game."
74,00:05:23.21,00:05:23.21,So I am kind of afraid that he could win the whole thing.
75,00:05:31.62,00:05:31.62,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys! So you guys ready to get to your"
76,00:05:42.75,00:05:42.75,reward challenge? >> Yeah.
77,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,">> Yeah. >> JEFF: For today's challenge,"

79,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,One member from each team will sit in their boat while the
80,00:05:52.79,00:05:52.79,opposing team will use buckets of water to try and sink them.
81,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,The person in the boat will have to bail the water out as fast as
82,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,possible to stay afloat. The first team to sink the other
83,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,team's boat two times wins reward.
84,00:06:05.25,00:06:05.25,Want to know what you're playing for?
85,00:06:07.12,00:06:07.12,">> Yes. >> Yeah, please."
86,00:06:09.08,00:06:09.08,>> JEFF: The winning team of four will leave here and be
87,00:06:11.38,00:06:11.38,taken to an ancient village. People have lived here for the

89,00:06:16.88,00:06:16.88,you'll enjoy an authentic Chinese meal.
90,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,>> Oh! >> JEFF: It's a break from camp
91,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,and a chance to put something good in your belly.
92,00:06:24.04,00:06:24.04,">> Hell, yeah. >> JEFF: In addition, the"
93,00:06:26.25,00:06:26.25,winning team of four will take this with them to open on the
94,00:06:28.46,00:06:28.46,reward. Worth playing for?
95,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,">> Yes! >> JEFF: All right, we're going"
96,00:06:32.92,00:06:32.92,to randomly choose captains. We'll do a schoolyard pick.
97,00:06:35.17,00:06:35.17,"Peih-Gee, you're the captain of the Red Team."
98,00:06:39.08,00:06:39.08,"Jean-Robert, you're the captain of the Yellow Team."

245,00:15:20.54,00:15:20.54,"You know, I want to stay in this game as long as I possibly can."

248,00:15:37.21,00:15:37.21,I think he's kind of more of the full threat package.

255,00:15:58.33,00:15:58.33,"Courtney are on final two, I'll give either one of you my vote."
256,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,Because I would love to see him taken out before me.
257,00:16:07.96,00:16:07.96,>> Peih-Gee is trying to shake things up and get us to vote out
258,00:16:10.12,00:16:10.12,"Jean-Robert. Nobody likes him, so it's kind"
259,00:16:12.46,00:16:12.46,of an easy vote. If I decide to go with Peih-Gee
260,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,"and Erik, I could end up in a good situation with them, but I"
261,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,don't want to go against the rest of the tribe and have them
262,00:16:22.25,00:16:22.25,vote against me. So I'm thinking it over and
263,00:16:25.25,00:16:25.25,deciding what I'm going to do. If I think the best way for me
264,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,"is to go with you guys, then I'm going to go with you guys."
265,00:16:30.75,00:16:30.75,"If I think the best way for me is to go with them, then I'm"
266,00:16:33.04,00:16:33.04,going to go with them. I'm going to tell you that
267,00:16:34.71,00:16:34.71,"honestly, Straight up."
268,00:17:36.21,00:17:36.21,">> I didn't even sleep last night, I was so anxious to get"
269,00:17:38.38,00:17:38.38,"that immunity idol. I mean, that's the difference in"
270,00:17:40.12,00:17:40.12,the game. That could protect me.
271,00:17:41.96,00:17:41.96,That could be my million dollars right there.
272,00:17:49.79,00:17:49.79,"I looked around, and I remember some clue about four bats, and I"
273,00:17:52.17,00:17:52.17,"know it's above, and I got the feeling that it was someplace"
274,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,where we walk every time we come home.
275,00:17:58.29,00:17:58.29,So I decided it was probably one of those mini pagodas.
276,00:18:10.71,00:18:10.71,Now I'm thinking it might be one of these plaques.
277,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,"The four bats thing makes sense, one of the plaques."
278,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,So right now I think I'm going to try to take the other three
279,00:18:19.00,00:18:19.00,"down, and I can figure out which one of them is right."
280,00:18:34.29,00:18:34.29,"If I have the immunity idol, it gives me a trump card."
281,00:18:38.12,00:18:38.12,"I like the direction I'm going, but I feel more comfortable with"
282,00:18:41.25,00:18:41.25,the trump card in my pocket knowing that the general public
283,00:18:43.62,00:18:43.62,doesn't have access to it right now.
284,00:19:09.67,00:19:09.67,">> James, you eat a good one- fourth of what's in there."
285,00:19:13.29,00:19:13.29,">> Oh, I do. >> You average probably two and"
286,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,a half times the average person. >> I'm not like you.
287,00:19:19.33,00:19:19.33,"I'm not laying down... >> No, no, no, don't say like"
288,00:19:22.12,00:19:22.12,me. When you were gone I was out
289,00:19:23.92,00:19:23.92,"there fishing and I never ate more than my fair portion, okay?"
290,00:19:26.21,00:19:26.21,Please don't say like me. >> We have been in the jungle
291,00:19:29.21,00:19:29.21,"for 23 days now, and these people are driving me insane."
292,00:19:34.25,00:19:34.25,I hate hearing Jean-Robert's voice.
293,00:19:37.21,00:19:37.21,I hate hearing James complain how he's so hungry.
294,00:19:40.29,00:19:40.29,Plus it kind of pisses me off that James has both hidden
295,00:19:43.04,00:19:43.04,"immunity idols, being that I found it and told him where the"
296,00:19:45.25,00:19:45.25,"other one was, and he hasn't even offered to give one back."
297,00:19:48.38,00:19:48.38,That drives me insane. So I would love to see some
298,00:19:52.54,00:19:52.54,"craziness happen here at camp. >> James, he's got himself in a"
299,00:20:03.08,00:20:03.08,"great position. With that hidden immunity idol,"
300,00:20:05.83,00:20:05.83,he's guaranteed in the final four.
301,00:20:08.58,00:20:08.58,"You know it. Yeah, people would be like, ""You"
302,00:20:14.83,00:20:14.83,"played a great game James. You did fantastic, here you go."""
303,00:20:22.04,00:20:22.04,"What if he keeps winning, winning, idol, idol?"
304,00:20:24.21,00:20:24.21,"Hell, no am I messing with two idols like that."
305,00:20:27.12,00:20:27.12,"If James doesn't win immunity, he might have to go."
306,00:20:33.62,00:20:33.62,"If he's guaranteed that Peih-Gee is going, he won't play that"
307,00:20:36.25,00:20:36.25,idol. >> The plan was originally to
308,00:20:39.88,00:20:39.88,"get rid of Peih-Gee next, and then Erik and Frosti after that."
309,00:20:43.75,00:20:43.75,"Now, all of a sudden, Todd is in a big hurry to get rid of James,"
310,00:20:47.12,00:20:47.12,"and him changing so quickly, like, really makes me nervous."
311,00:20:55.04,00:20:55.04,>> You know what I mean? >> Yeah.
312,00:20:57.25,00:20:57.25,>> And... We will not tell Peih-Gee.
313,00:21:05.58,00:21:05.58,">> All right. >> Because we can't, because she"
314,00:21:07.54,00:21:07.54,"will tell James. >> In this game, you've got to"
315,00:21:10.21,00:21:10.21,take advantage of whatever happens whenever you can.
316,00:21:12.38,00:21:12.38,"And right now, people are starting to view me as a swing"
317,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,"vote, which ends up being not so bad."
318,00:21:20.17,00:21:20.17,>> Sound good? Sounds good.
319,00:21:24.79,00:21:24.79,>> I'm always looking for a chance to make sure that I'm
320,00:21:27.21,00:21:27.21,"safe, so right now, the plan is to not let James win immunity at"
321,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,this next challenge and blindside him at tribal tonight.

327,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,going to balance on a large barrel that is filled with
328,00:22:15.33,00:22:15.33,water. There is a hole on the bottom of
329,00:22:18.29,00:22:18.29,"the barrel. As the water drains out, it will"
330,00:22:21.12,00:22:21.12,"become more and more unstable, making it more difficult to keep"

337,00:22:47.58,00:22:47.58,First lever you're going to push is the yellow lever.
338,00:22:50.83,00:22:50.83,"That will pull the plug, allowing the water to drain out"

361,00:24:22.62,00:24:22.62,Jean-Robert's the first one out. Take a spot on the bench.
362,00:24:26.08,00:24:26.08,"Eight people left. Denise really fighting it, and"
363,00:24:33.25,00:24:33.25,Denise goes in the swamp. Denise the second person out of

375,00:25:21.08,00:25:21.08,James struggling again. Can he make another recovery?
376,00:25:25.17,00:25:25.17,No. James is the third person out of
377,00:25:28.21,00:25:28.21,this challenge. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Don don don... \xe2\x99\xaa
378,00:25:30.96,00:25:30.96,>> JEFF: Take a spot on the bench.
379,00:25:32.79,00:25:32.79,We are down to six people left in this challenge.
380,00:25:40.08,00:25:40.08,Todd starting to struggle a bit now.
381,00:25:43.29,00:25:43.29,Erik struggling. Can he get it back?
382,00:25:47.12,00:25:47.12,And Erik goes in. Erik is the fourth person out of
383,00:25:49.17,00:25:49.17,this challenge. Peih-Gee and Amanda struggling a
384,00:25:53.88,00:25:53.88,"bit. Peih-Gee fighting it, and loses"
385,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,the battle. Peih-Gee is the fifth person out
386,00:26:05.17,00:26:05.17,"of this challenge. Whoa, Amanda, hands off."
387,00:26:11.96,00:26:11.96,Amanda's out. Touched the structure.
388,00:26:14.75,00:26:14.75,Amanda is the sixth person out of the challenge.
389,00:26:18.38,00:26:18.38,"We are down to three-- Courtney, Frosti, Todd."
390,00:26:23.33,00:26:23.33,All fighting for immunity. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Starving artist
391,00:26:32.33,00:26:32.33,on the dragon \xe2\x99\xaa >> Frosti's singing.
392,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Balancing on barrels for Jeff Probst \xe2\x99\xaa
393,00:26:47.00,00:26:47.00,>> JEFF: Todd is the seventh person out of this challenge.
394,00:26:51.75,00:26:51.75,And then there were two. >> Lovers.
395,00:26:54.62,00:26:54.62,>> JEFF: Courtney and Frosti sitting side by side.
396,00:26:57.25,00:26:57.25,Courtney has not moved in 32 minutes.
397,00:27:02.12,00:27:02.12,>> I am lazy. >> That sucks.
398,00:27:10.50,00:27:10.50,"That sucks. Oh... no, never mind."
399,00:27:33.08,00:27:33.08,>> JEFF: Frosti tries to recover.
400,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,Can't do it. Frosti's out.
401,00:27:40.25,00:27:40.25,"Courtney wins immunity! >> Thanks, guys."
402,00:27:44.58,00:27:44.58,">> JEFF: Courtney, come on over. >> It's almost like a pageant."
403,00:27:48.54,00:27:48.54,">> Good job, Courtney. >> JEFF: Courtney, you are safe"
404,00:27:51.71,00:27:51.71,"tonight at tribal council. With this around your neck, you"
405,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,cannot be voted out. Courtney has a one in eight shot
406,00:27:56.58,00:27:56.58,"at a million dollars. For the rest of you, tonight,"
407,00:27:59.92,00:27:59.92,one of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure
408,00:28:02.29,00:28:02.29,"out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to"
409,00:28:04.67,00:28:04.67,camp. >> Thank you.
410,00:28:31.17,00:28:31.17,I did win immunity today. I didn't think I would ever win
411,00:28:33.46,00:28:33.46,anything. ( laughs )
412,00:28:36.25,00:28:36.25,So I pretty much don't care at this point who gets voted out.
413,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"I'm immune tonight, so can't get me."
414,00:28:45.21,00:28:45.21,Nope. >> I was crushed I didn't win it
415,00:28:48.42,00:28:48.42,"today, because I know I'm next on the chopping block."
416,00:28:52.38,00:28:52.38,"I've been really trying to scramble and save my ass, and"
417,00:28:56.21,00:28:56.21,Denise seemed really open to the idea of voting with me and my
418,00:29:00.79,00:29:00.79,other allies. So hopefully it will get me
419,00:29:04.67,00:29:04.67,through one more tribal council. >> I thought you were on the
420,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,chopping block because you were getting votes.
421,00:29:21.12,00:29:21.12,">> Actually, right now I might not get as many votes."
422,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,>> Things have changed? >> I think they... yeah.
423,00:29:26.79,00:29:26.79,I... I have the hidden immunity idol.
424,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,"Yeah. Now that I have it, I look like"
425,00:29:35.04,00:29:35.04,I'm pretty much guaranteed top five for sure right now.
426,00:29:38.46,00:29:38.46,">> I was trying to think, how can I keep me in the game"
427,00:29:40.58,00:29:40.58,"longer, and then Jean-Robert told me he had the idol, and"
428,00:29:43.58,00:29:43.58,that changed everything. 'Cause I'm 99% positive that
429,00:29:46.88,00:29:46.88,James has it. What would you say if I told you
430,00:29:50.42,00:29:50.42,I was pretty sure that you didn't have the right immunity
431,00:29:53.54,00:29:53.54,idol? >> I'd say that you probably
432,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,don't have as many clues as I do.
433,00:29:58.38,00:29:58.38,">> Okay, I'm willing to share with you what I know."
434,00:30:01.71,00:30:01.71,">> Okay. >> James comes over to our camp,"
435,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,"and that little block from the archway, we looked in James' bag"
436,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,and there were two of them. >> But...
437,00:30:15.54,00:30:15.54,>> Because there's two hidden immunity idols.
438,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,>> There's two hidden immunity idols?
439,00:30:20.25,00:30:20.25,>> One in each camp. And I'm almost positive James
440,00:30:21.88,00:30:21.88,has them. Okay.
441,00:30:32.33,00:30:32.33,Hmmm. How sick is that?
442,00:30:35.50,00:30:35.50,And this is the guy who is favored to win every challenge
443,00:30:38.08,00:30:38.08,from here out. I'll tell what you we can do.
444,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,We'll keep this on the DL. >> Have you been looking?
445,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,What have you come up with? >> What I came up with is the
446,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,realization that you're holding out on me.
447,00:31:10.42,00:31:10.42,That's what I came up with. >> I don't know what the hell
448,00:31:12.75,00:31:12.75,"you're talking about. >> Yes, you do."
449,00:31:15.96,00:31:15.96,">> No, I don't. >> Yes, you do."
450,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,You had to know I was going to figure it out sooner or later.
451,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,>> Figure what out? >> You have two immunity idols.
452,00:31:21.12,00:31:21.12,"Two of them, and you can't tell your boy?"
453,00:31:23.25,00:31:23.25,"Nobody told me, bro. Who else do you think would"
454,00:31:26.46,00:31:26.46,figure something out like that except for me?
455,00:31:30.67,00:31:30.67,Come on. Okay.
456,00:31:34.29,00:31:34.29,>> Jean-Robert was just fishing for answers.
457,00:31:37.29,00:31:37.29,I don't know what he was trying to pull.
458,00:31:39.29,00:31:39.29,"He knows I don't like being sequestered or cornered, like he"
459,00:31:41.25,00:31:41.25,was so cunning he'd fool me in some way.
460,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,>> Now I'm not even going to ask you anymore.
461,00:31:45.04,00:31:45.04,"I'm telling you that I already know, and I'm leaving it up to"
462,00:31:47.17,00:31:47.17,you to decide-- do you want to work with me or are we going on
463,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,our own? The best course to the end is
464,00:31:52.38,00:31:52.38,"always going to be with me, not against me."
465,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,It cannot work up on the well with you if you don't go with
466,00:31:58.21,00:31:58.21,me. >> I might look like a dumb
467,00:32:00.04,00:32:00.04,"monkey, and just fall for anything, but I'm really not."
468,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,"I mean, come on, dude. You're Jean-Robert."
469,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,You can't trust anything that comes out of your mouth anyway.
470,00:32:06.42,00:32:06.42,Why would I align with you? That would be the worst move of
471,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,Survivor history to align with that guy.
472,00:32:19.42,00:32:19.42,>> James kept playing dumb like he doesn't know what I was
473,00:32:21.62,00:32:21.62,"talking about, and he didn't make any kind of offer about"
474,00:32:24.29,00:32:24.29,what we could do with this advantage together.
475,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,Now I feel like it's kind of fair game.
476,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,"Big, big news. >> I know where the idol is, and"
477,00:32:39.46,00:32:39.46,there's not just one idol. There's two idols.
478,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,">> You're talking about James, right?"
479,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,>> He has both idols. >> Okay.
480,00:32:44.79,00:32:44.79,>> How did you know that? >> I was just... I've heard
481,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,hearsay. >> He has both idols.
482,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,"Here's the thing-- we could blindside him tonight, because"
483,00:32:50.38,00:32:50.38,he will not pull out the idol tonight.
484,00:32:52.96,00:32:52.96,">> I know, I know. Let's see how it goes today."
485,00:32:59.25,00:32:59.25,"You know, it's really funny-- I had an original idea to take"
486,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,"James out, and then Jean-Robert just came up with the same idea,"
487,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,and I was kind of bothered by the fact that he's coming up
488,00:33:08.21,00:33:08.21,with all these ideas I've had for days now.
489,00:33:10.08,00:33:10.08,So I'm always entertaining options.
490,00:33:12.83,00:33:12.83,I could change my mind in two minutes.
491,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,"Who knows? This game is fun, and I like"
492,00:33:16.88,00:33:16.88,keeping it fun. >> He right now has Erik and
493,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,possibly Peih-Gee and Frosti. That's four.
494,00:33:27.25,00:33:27.25,And I'm five. He thinks you're going tonight.
495,00:33:29.50,00:33:29.50,"I played it up. Like, ""Yeah, okay, this sounds"
496,00:33:32.25,00:33:32.25,"like a good idea."" But should we do Jean-Robert"
497,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,tonight? We don't want to tell Denise or
498,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,no? >> No.
499,00:33:43.21,00:33:43.21,"Denise wavering, and Denise getting pissed off."
500,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,>> I still think we should get rid of Peih-Gee tonight and the
501,00:33:47.83,00:33:47.83,Jean-Robert next time. Todd is all over the place right
502,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,"now. One person comes up to him, he"
503,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,rethinks his whole strategy. He's second-guessing himself.
504,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,"And in this game, you have to be confident about your choices."
505,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,So I really don't know what's going to happen at this point.
506,00:34:01.08,00:34:01.08,">> Here's Courtney. >> Courtney, come here."
507,00:34:09.29,00:34:09.29,>> Um... I don't know.
508,00:34:12.21,00:34:12.21,"I mean... I don't know. I mean... well, I don't... it's"
509,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,up to you guys. I don't give a crap.
510,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,"I'm not entirely sure what happened, but all of a sudden,"
511,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,Todd decided to vote for Jean- Robert.
512,00:34:21.79,00:34:21.79,>> I think our best bet is Jean- Robert tonight.
513,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,>> It's a widely known fact that Jean-Robert and I have hated
514,00:34:30.58,00:34:30.58,each other since day one. So if everyone's finally willing
515,00:34:33.79,00:34:33.79,"to vote him out, then great. But he's become the Susan Lucci"
516,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,"of tribal council. Like, his name is always up"
517,00:34:40.04,00:34:40.04,"there, but he never quite gets voted out."
518,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,So I don't have much faith that it will actually happen.
519,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,">> I knew Jean-Robert was going to try something, and I'm just"
520,00:34:49.50,00:34:49.50,going to have to deal with it. Hopefully I'll make it through.
521,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,"I don't know if I will take the idols with me, because I"
522,00:34:54.38,00:34:54.38,shouldn't have to use them. So I might just roll the dice
523,00:34:56.58,00:34:56.58,tonight. As long as I make it to the next
524,00:34:59.25,00:34:59.25,"one, I should be all right. But, I mean, you never know."
525,00:35:22.08,00:35:22.08,>> JEFF: I'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
526,00:35:28.08,00:35:28.08,"Jaime, voted out at the last tribal council."
527,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,"Just remind you the jury is here to observe, not to interact."
528,00:35:37.88,00:35:37.88,"Courtney, would you have ever guessed that you would be here"
529,00:35:41.62,00:35:41.62,on day 24 wearing the immunity necklace?
530,00:35:45.12,00:35:45.12,>> Hell no! ( applause )
531,00:35:48.46,00:35:48.46,"But if I was going to win a challenge, you better believe it"
532,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,was one that involved not falling in the swamp.
533,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,">> JEFF: James, this is the second tribal council you've"
534,00:35:57.12,00:35:57.12,been at without immunity. You're one of the biggest
535,00:36:00.46,00:36:00.46,physical threats in this game. Do you get more concerned with
536,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,each tribal that maybe tonight is your night?
537,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,">> Yes, I do. I am the biggest physical threat"
538,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,"but the far greater threats are the talkers, the ones who could"
539,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"form alliances easier, that would trade up and switch around"
540,00:36:16.04,00:36:16.04,"and do all kinds of other stuff. >> JEFF: Peih-Gee, if you look"
541,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,"at the tribe tonight, you still have a great number of Fei Long"
542,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,"members, and you have you, Frosti, and Erik."
543,00:36:25.62,00:36:25.62,">> Yeah, Erik and I are the only ones that brought our stuff, so,"
544,00:36:29.46,00:36:29.46,"obviously, I think we're the only ones who think that we're"
545,00:36:31.71,00:36:31.71,"going home. You know, like, I was devastated"
546,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,"losing that challenge today, and it's tough."
547,00:36:36.54,00:36:36.54,"It's really hard. >> JEFF: Jean-Robert, how"
548,00:36:39.12,00:36:39.12,frustrated would you be if the situation were reversed and you
549,00:36:42.62,00:36:42.62,were sitting in Peih-Gee's or Erik's shoes?
550,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,">> I would be really frustrated, because they're this a really"
551,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,"bad position right now, really bad position."
552,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,"I mean, they've had really bad cards thrown at them."
553,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,They basically got the deuce- seven off suit in a no limit
554,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,"game. And they've come in a situation,"
555,00:36:56.92,00:36:56.92,it's pretty much have inevitable.
556,00:36:58.75,00:36:58.75,">> JEFF: Erik, agree with Jean- Robert, disagree?"
557,00:37:00.75,00:37:00.75,">> It's, of course, tough, but everybody else that's left from"
558,00:37:03.46,00:37:03.46,"Fei Long is going to realize, like, if I have six people,"
559,00:37:06.33,00:37:06.33,"somebody's at the bottom of that, and I'm not just saying"
560,00:37:08.75,00:37:08.75,"that to lobby. I'm just saying, like, if I know"
561,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,"I'm going to go fifth or sixth, I'm going to start thinking"
562,00:37:14.17,00:37:14.17,before that. And I'm not saying that to try
563,00:37:16.79,00:37:16.79,and sell people. That is how this game has to
564,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,work. People are going to have to
565,00:37:20.92,00:37:20.92,split. >> JEFF: James you're throwing
566,00:37:22.88,00:37:22.88,"your hands up. >> I mean, he's so cute what he"
567,00:37:24.79,00:37:24.79,says like he's trying to play it up.
568,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,But I like... I like it. He's beautiful.
569,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,He's working it. He's working it right now.
570,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,"Already. >> JEFF: Jean-Robert, at the"
571,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"last tribal council, Jaime played what she thought was a"
572,00:37:40.29,00:37:40.29,hidden immunity idol. How does the notion that there
573,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,could be a hidden immunity idol change the game?
574,00:37:46.29,00:37:46.29,">> When Jaime presented that last week, I thought I was going"
575,00:37:48.46,00:37:48.46,home. When your job is being the local
576,00:37:50.42,00:37:50.42,jerk... ( laughter )
577,00:37:53.12,00:37:53.12,"...as the local jerk, I will probably have my name on a"
578,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,ballot or two maybe three every time.
579,00:37:58.62,00:37:58.62,"But if somebody happens to place that idol at the right time,"
580,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,that could be me going home. That's scary.
581,00:38:03.79,00:38:03.79,">> JEFF: Amanda, is it true that every time you come to tribal"
582,00:38:06.38,00:38:06.38,you truly believe it could be you?
583,00:38:09.12,00:38:09.12,">> Every time you come here, you expect to be going because,"
584,00:38:12.38,00:38:12.38,anybody could be doing things that you don't know about.
585,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,"So I don't like coming to tribal council, and I'm not"
586,00:38:18.21,00:38:18.21,comfortable. I'm not.
587,00:38:20.88,00:38:20.88,">> JEFF: Okay, Courtney, you have individual immunity."
588,00:38:24.42,00:38:24.42,"As always, if you want to give it up to somebody else, you can."
589,00:38:27.79,00:38:27.79,>> No. Screw you guys.
590,00:38:29.88,00:38:29.88,>> JEFF: Courtney's going to keep it.
591,00:38:31.75,00:38:31.75,You cannot vote for Courtney. Everybody else is fair game.
592,00:38:33.29,00:38:33.29,"It is time to vote. Todd, you're up."
593,00:38:49.25,00:38:49.25,>> I hope this is the last time I have to vote for you.
594,00:38:51.25,00:38:51.25,"Maybe we all can sleep now. >> Peih-Gee, I'm voting for you."
595,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,You just happened to get on the wrong tribe.
596,00:39:20.04,00:39:20.04,">> You've played an incredible game, my friend."
597,00:39:22.08,00:39:22.08,That's why we've got to send you packing.
598,00:39:37.00,00:39:37.00,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
599,00:39:47.67,00:39:47.67,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
600,00:39:50.08,00:39:50.08,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
601,00:39:52.04,00:39:52.04,council area immediately. If anyone has a hidden immunity
602,00:39:54.21,00:39:54.21,"idol, now is the time to play it."
603,00:40:02.21,00:40:02.21,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Jean-Robert."
604,00:40:10.54,00:40:10.54,Jean-Robert. Two votes Jean-Robert.
605,00:40:17.08,00:40:17.08,"Peih-Gee. Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote"
606,00:40:19.33,00:40:19.33,Peih-Gee. James.
607,00:40:24.25,00:40:24.25,"Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote Peih-Gee, one vote James."
608,00:40:29.67,00:40:29.67,"James. That's two votes James, two"
609,00:40:32.04,00:40:32.04,votes Jean-Robert. One vote Peih-Gee.
610,00:40:37.25,00:40:37.25,"James. That's three votes James, two"
611,00:40:39.88,00:40:39.88,"votes Jean-Robert, one vote Peih-Gee."
612,00:40:45.17,00:40:45.17,Jean-Robert. We're tied.
613,00:40:47.75,00:40:47.75,"Three votes Jean-Robert, three votes James, one vote Peih-Gee."
614,00:40:52.46,00:40:52.46,Jean-Robert. That's four votes Jean-Robert.
615,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,"Three votes James, one vote Peih-Gee, one vote left."
616,00:41:08.67,00:41:08.67,"Eighth person voted out and the second member of our jury, Jean-"
617,00:41:11.46,00:41:11.46,Robert. You need to bring me your torch.
618,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,"Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken."
619,00:41:29.62,00:41:29.62,"Time for you to go. Well, I think tonight's vote"
620,00:41:45.25,00:41:45.25,speaks for itself. Tribal lines are gone.
621,00:41:48.12,00:41:48.12,This is a brand-new game. Grab your torches.
622,00:41:50.33,00:41:50.33,Head back to camp. Good night.

632,00:42:26.17,00:42:26.17,Tonight you will not be heading directly back to camp.
633,00:42:28.50,00:42:28.50,We have more business to attend to here.
634,00:42:37.62,00:42:37.62,>> I really loved the way I played this game.
635,00:42:39.62,00:42:39.62,"If I were to relate what happened to a game of poker, I"
636,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,pushed all in and it didn't work out for me.
637,00:42:45.12,00:42:45.12,"But I'm playing for first, and the only person who really"
638,00:42:47.33,00:42:47.33,threatened that first-place position for me was James.
639,00:42:50.00,00:42:50.00,But I think they realized that I probably was the best player in
640,00:42:52.25,00:42:52.25,"the game, and they would feel a lot more comfortable with me out"
641,00:42:54.38,00:42:54.38,of the game.
