261,00:16:22.25,00:16:22.25,vote against me.So I'm thinking it over and
262,00:16:25.25,00:16:25.25,deciding what I'm going to do.If I think the best way for me
263,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,"is to go with you guys, then I'mgoing to go with you guys."
264,00:16:30.75,00:16:30.75,"If I think the best way for meis to go with them, then I'm"

270,00:17:41.96,00:17:41.96,That could be my milliondollars right there.
271,00:17:49.79,00:17:49.79,"I looked around, and I remembersome clue about four bats, and I"
272,00:17:52.17,00:17:52.17,"know it's above, and I got thefeeling that it was someplace"
273,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,where we walk every time we comehome.
274,00:17:58.29,00:17:58.29,So I decided it was probablyone of those mini pagodas.
275,00:18:10.71,00:18:10.71,Now I'm thinking it might be oneof these plaques.
276,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,"The four bats thing makes sense,one of the plaques."
277,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,So right now I think I'm goingto try to take the other three
278,00:18:19.00,00:18:19.00,"down, and I can figure out whichone of them is right."
279,00:18:34.29,00:18:34.29,"If I have the immunity idol, itgives me a trump card."

282,00:18:43.62,00:18:43.62,doesn't have access to it rightnow.

292,00:19:37.21,00:19:37.21,I hate hearing James complainhow he's so hungry.
293,00:19:40.29,00:19:40.29,Plus it kind of pisses me offthat James has both hidden

411,00:28:36.25,00:28:36.25,So I pretty much don't care atthis point who gets voted out.
412,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"I'm immune tonight, so can't getme."
413,00:28:45.21,00:28:45.21,Nope.>> I was crushed I didn't win it
414,00:28:48.42,00:28:48.42,"today, because I know I'm nexton the chopping block."
415,00:28:52.38,00:28:52.38,"I've been really trying toscramble and save my ass, and"
416,00:28:56.21,00:28:56.21,Denise seemed really open to theidea of voting with me and my
417,00:29:00.79,00:29:00.79,other allies.So hopefully it will get me
418,00:29:04.67,00:29:04.67,through one more tribal council.>> I thought you were on the
419,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,chopping block because you weregetting votes.
420,00:29:21.12,00:29:21.12,">> Actually, right now I mightnot get as many votes."
421,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,>> Things have changed?>> I think they... yeah.
422,00:29:26.79,00:29:26.79,I... I have the hidden immunityidol.
423,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,"Yeah.Now that I have it, I look like"
424,00:29:35.04,00:29:35.04,I'm pretty much guaranteed topfive for sure right now.
425,00:29:38.46,00:29:38.46,">> I was trying to think, howcan I keep me in the game"
426,00:29:40.58,00:29:40.58,"longer, and then Jean-Roberttold me he had the idol, and"
427,00:29:43.58,00:29:43.58,that changed everything.'Cause I'm 99% positive that
428,00:29:46.88,00:29:46.88,James has it.What would you say if I told you
429,00:29:50.42,00:29:50.42,I was pretty sure that youdidn't have the right immunity
430,00:29:53.54,00:29:53.54,idol?>> I'd say that you probably
431,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,don't have as many clues as Ido.
432,00:29:58.38,00:29:58.38,">> Okay, I'm willing to sharewith you what I know."
433,00:30:01.71,00:30:01.71,">> Okay.>> James comes over to our camp,"
434,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,"and that little block from thearchway, we looked in James' bag"
435,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,and there were two of them.>> But...
436,00:30:15.54,00:30:15.54,>> Because there's two hiddenimmunity idols.
437,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,>> There's two hidden immunityidols?
438,00:30:20.25,00:30:20.25,>> One in each camp.And I'm almost positive James
439,00:30:21.88,00:30:21.88,has them.Okay.
440,00:30:32.33,00:30:32.33,Hmmm.How sick is that?
441,00:30:35.50,00:30:35.50,And this is the guy who isfavored to win every challenge
442,00:30:38.08,00:30:38.08,from here out.I'll tell what you we can do.
443,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,We'll keep this on the DL.>> Have you been looking?
444,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,What have you come up with?>> What I came up with is the
445,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,realization that you're holdingout on me.
446,00:31:10.42,00:31:10.42,That's what I came up with.>> I don't know what the hell
447,00:31:12.75,00:31:12.75,"you're talking about.>> Yes, you do."
448,00:31:15.96,00:31:15.96,">> No, I don't.>> Yes, you do."
449,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,You had to know I was going tofigure it out sooner or later.
450,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,>> Figure what out?>> You have two immunity idols.
451,00:31:21.12,00:31:21.12,"Two of them, and you can't tellyour boy?"
452,00:31:23.25,00:31:23.25,"Nobody told me, bro.Who else do you think would"
453,00:31:26.46,00:31:26.46,figure something out like thatexcept for me?
454,00:31:30.67,00:31:30.67,Come on.Okay.
455,00:31:34.29,00:31:34.29,>> Jean-Robert was just fishingfor answers.
456,00:31:37.29,00:31:37.29,I don't know what he was tryingto pull.
457,00:31:39.29,00:31:39.29,"He knows I don't like beingsequestered or cornered, like he"
458,00:31:41.25,00:31:41.25,was so cunning he'd fool me insome way.
459,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,>> Now I'm not even going to askyou anymore.
460,00:31:45.04,00:31:45.04,"I'm telling you that I alreadyknow, and I'm leaving it up to"
461,00:31:47.17,00:31:47.17,you to decide-- do you want towork with me or are we going on
462,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,our own?The best course to the end is
463,00:31:52.38,00:31:52.38,"always going to be with me,not against me."
464,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,It cannot work up on the wellwith you if you don't go with
465,00:31:58.21,00:31:58.21,me.>> I might look like a dumb
466,00:32:00.04,00:32:00.04,"monkey, and just fall foranything, but I'm really not."
467,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,"I mean, come on, dude.You're Jean-Robert."
468,00:32:04.25,00:32:04.25,You can't trust anything thatcomes out of your mouth anyway.
469,00:32:06.42,00:32:06.42,Why would I align with you?That would be the worst move of
470,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,Survivor history to align withthat guy.
471,00:32:19.42,00:32:19.42,>> James kept playing dumb likehe doesn't know what I was
472,00:32:21.62,00:32:21.62,"talking about, and he didn'tmake any kind of offer about"
473,00:32:24.29,00:32:24.29,what we could do with thisadvantage together.
474,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,Now I feel like it's kind offair game.
475,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,"Big, big news.>> I know where the idol is, and"
476,00:32:39.46,00:32:39.46,there's not just one idol.There's two idols.
477,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,">> You're talking about James,right?"
478,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,>> He has both idols.>> Okay.
479,00:32:44.79,00:32:44.79,>> How did you know that?>> I was just... I've heard
480,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,hearsay.>> He has both idols.
481,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,"Here's the thing-- we couldblindside him tonight, because"
482,00:32:50.38,00:32:50.38,he will not pull out the idoltonight.
483,00:32:52.96,00:32:52.96,">> I know, I know.Let's see how it goes today."
484,00:32:59.25,00:32:59.25,"You know, it's really funny-- Ihad an original idea to take"
485,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,"James out, and then Jean-Robertjust came up with the same idea,"
486,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,and I was kind of bothered bythe fact that he's coming up
487,00:33:08.21,00:33:08.21,with all these ideas I've hadfor days now.
488,00:33:10.08,00:33:10.08,So I'm always entertainingoptions.
489,00:33:12.83,00:33:12.83,I could change my mind in twominutes.
490,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,"Who knows?This game is fun, and I like"
491,00:33:16.88,00:33:16.88,keeping it fun.>> He right now has Erik and
492,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,possibly Peih-Gee and Frosti.That's four.
493,00:33:27.25,00:33:27.25,And I'm five.He thinks you're going tonight.
494,00:33:29.50,00:33:29.50,"I played it up.Like, ""Yeah, okay, this sounds"
495,00:33:32.25,00:33:32.25,"like a good idea.""But should we do Jean-Robert"
496,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,tonight?We don't want to tell Denise or
497,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,no?>> No.
498,00:33:43.21,00:33:43.21,"Denise wavering, and Denisegetting pissed off."
499,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,>> I still think we should getrid of Peih-Gee tonight and the
500,00:33:47.83,00:33:47.83,Jean-Robert next time.Todd is all over the place right
501,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,"now.One person comes up to him, he"
502,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,rethinks his whole strategy.He's second-guessing himself.
503,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,"And in this game, you have to beconfident about your choices."
504,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,So I really don't know what'sgoing to happen at this point.
505,00:34:01.08,00:34:01.08,">> Here's Courtney.>> Courtney, come here."
506,00:34:09.29,00:34:09.29,>> Um...I don't know.
507,00:34:12.21,00:34:12.21,"I mean... I don't know.I mean... well, I don't... it's"
508,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,up to you guys.I don't give a crap.
509,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,"I'm not entirely sure whathappened, but all of a sudden,"
510,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,Todd decided to vote for Jean-Robert.
511,00:34:21.79,00:34:21.79,>> I think our best bet is Jean-Robert tonight.
512,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,>> It's a widely known fact thatJean-Robert and I have hated
513,00:34:30.58,00:34:30.58,each other since day one.So if everyone's finally willing
514,00:34:33.79,00:34:33.79,"to vote him out, then great.But he's become the Susan Lucci"
515,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,"of tribal council.Like, his name is always up"
516,00:34:40.04,00:34:40.04,"there, but he never quite getsvoted out."
517,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,So I don't have much faith thatit will actually happen.
518,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,">> I knew Jean-Robert was goingto try something, and I'm just"
519,00:34:49.50,00:34:49.50,going to have to deal with it.Hopefully I'll make it through.
520,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,"I don't know if I will take theidols with me, because I"
521,00:34:54.38,00:34:54.38,shouldn't have to use them.So I might just roll the dice
522,00:34:56.58,00:34:56.58,tonight.As long as I make it to the next
523,00:34:59.25,00:34:59.25,"one, I should be all right.But, I mean, you never know."
524,00:35:22.08,00:35:22.08,>> JEFF: I'll now bring in thefirst member of our jury.
525,00:35:28.08,00:35:28.08,"Jaime, voted out at the lasttribal council."
526,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,"Just remind you the jury is hereto observe, not to interact."
527,00:35:37.88,00:35:37.88,"Courtney, would you have everguessed that you would be here"
528,00:35:41.62,00:35:41.62,on day 24 wearing the immunitynecklace?
529,00:35:45.12,00:35:45.12,>> Hell no!( applause )
530,00:35:48.46,00:35:48.46,"But if I was going to win achallenge, you better believe it"
531,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,was one that involved notfalling in the swamp.
532,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,">> JEFF: James, this is thesecond tribal council you've"
533,00:35:57.12,00:35:57.12,been at without immunity.You're one of the biggest
534,00:36:00.46,00:36:00.46,physical threats in this game.Do you get more concerned with
535,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,each tribal that maybe tonightis your night?
536,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,">> Yes, I do.I am the biggest physical threat"
537,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,"but the far greater threats arethe talkers, the ones who could"
538,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"form alliances easier, thatwould trade up and switch around"
539,00:36:16.04,00:36:16.04,"and do all kinds of other stuff.>> JEFF: Peih-Gee, if you look"
540,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,"at the tribe tonight, you stillhave a great number of Fei Long"
541,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,"members, and you have you,Frosti, and Erik."
542,00:36:25.62,00:36:25.62,">> Yeah, Erik and I are the onlyones that brought our stuff, so,"
543,00:36:29.46,00:36:29.46,"obviously, I think we're theonly ones who think that we're"
544,00:36:31.71,00:36:31.71,"going home.You know, like, I was devastated"
545,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,"losing that challenge today, andit's tough."
546,00:36:36.54,00:36:36.54,"It's really hard.>> JEFF: Jean-Robert, how"
547,00:36:39.12,00:36:39.12,frustrated would you be if thesituation were reversed and you
548,00:36:42.62,00:36:42.62,were sitting in Peih-Gee's orErik's shoes?
549,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,">> I would be really frustrated,because they're this a really"
550,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,"bad position right now, reallybad position."
551,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,"I mean, they've had really badcards thrown at them."
552,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,They basically got the deuce-seven off suit in a no limit
553,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,"game.And they've come in a situation,"
554,00:36:56.92,00:36:56.92,it's pretty much haveinevitable.
555,00:36:58.75,00:36:58.75,">> JEFF: Erik, agree with Jean-Robert, disagree?"
556,00:37:00.75,00:37:00.75,">> It's, of course, tough, buteverybody else that's left from"

558,00:37:06.33,00:37:06.33,"somebody's at the bottom ofthat, and I'm not just saying"
559,00:37:08.75,00:37:08.75,"that to lobby.I'm just saying, like, if I know"
