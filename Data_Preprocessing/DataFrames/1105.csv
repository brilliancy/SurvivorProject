108,00:06:58.04,00:06:58.04,probably wouldn't be friendswith outside of the game.
109,00:07:00.75,00:07:00.75,"They come from different partsof the country, you know."
110,00:07:02.58,00:07:02.58,"I'm very New England, I'm veryblue state, and they're very"

121,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,"But I'm not going to object toit, that would be stupid."
122,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,"You'd be stupid to say, like,you know what, guys?"
123,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,"I don't want to thank Jesus forthis meal, thanks."
124,00:07:46.12,00:07:46.12,Because then they'd vote meright out-- that's dumb.
125,00:07:48.17,00:07:48.17,"Even if I object to something,you have to grin and bear it."
126,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,That's the strategy out here.>> Amen.

579,00:33:43.50,00:33:43.50,about team unity.I do know there's going to be
580,00:33:46.50,00:33:46.50,"some times where I am going tohave to switch my vote, and I"
581,00:33:49.88,00:33:49.88,feel like right now is not oneof those times.
