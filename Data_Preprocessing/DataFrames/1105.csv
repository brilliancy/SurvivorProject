2,00:00:02.75,00:00:02.75,Survivor... Yaxha dodged deadly  visitors.
3,00:00:05.33,00:00:05.33,>> Wow. >> It ate something.
4,00:00:08.08,00:00:08.08,That could have been one of us if we were swimming across its
5,00:00:10.42,00:00:10.42,path. >> What?
6,00:00:12.42,00:00:12.42,>> A fish got me. >> PROBST: Then everything
7,00:00:14.38,00:00:14.38,changed when the tribes were unexpectedly switched.
8,00:00:17.21,00:00:17.21,"Drop your buffs. >> Oh, my God!"
9,00:00:20.08,00:00:20.08,">> PROBST: Danni, Brandon, Bobby Jon and Blake were the new"
10,00:00:22.46,00:00:22.46,"members of Yaxha, and Jamie, Lydia, Rafe and Stephenie"
11,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,"joined Nakum. At the new Nakum tribe,"
12,00:00:28.96,00:00:28.96,Stephenie and Jamie approached Judd about turning on his old
13,00:00:32.96,00:00:32.96,tribe mate Brooke. >> Then we'll get rid of Brooke.
14,00:00:35.62,00:00:35.62,">> Like I said, man, I'm all with you guys, man."
15,00:00:38.25,00:00:38.25,"I'm all for that, man. >> PROBST: And Margaret felt"
16,00:00:40.46,00:00:40.46,"uneasy about Judd's loyalties. >> With this switch-up today, I"
17,00:00:43.42,00:00:43.42,don't feel safe at all. >> I know I'm the big gun around
18,00:00:45.96,00:00:45.96,"here. You feel like you're King Kong,"
19,00:00:47.96,00:00:47.96,"man. ( deep, raspy hooting )"
20,00:00:51.58,00:00:51.58,">> PROBST: At Yaxha, Brian, Amy and Gary felt the pressure of"
21,00:00:54.83,00:00:54.83,"being outnumbered by their new tribe mates, three to four."
22,00:00:58.08,00:00:58.08,>> We're decimated here. >> PROBST: Blake and Bobby Jon
23,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,shared a private moment to confirm their game plan.
24,00:01:07.12,00:01:07.12,">> Bobby and I, you know, had a little bathroom break and a"
25,00:01:09.12,00:01:09.12,little pep talk. We already picked the order.
26,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,"It's Amy, Brian and Gary out the door."
27,00:01:12.92,00:01:12.92,>> PROBST: At the immunity challenge...
28,00:01:14.29,00:01:14.29,">> Come on, Brian, keep on popping them, Brandon."
29,00:01:16.04,00:01:16.04,>> PROBST: Yaxha threw their way to victory.
30,00:01:18.04,00:01:18.04,"Yaxha wins immunity! Back at Nakum, Margaret"
31,00:01:22.42,00:01:22.42,pressured Judd to vote off Lydia and keep the four former Nakum
32,00:01:26.04,00:01:26.04,"members united. >> They're going to be four,"
33,00:01:28.92,00:01:28.92,we'll be three. They can pick us off one by one.
34,00:01:31.12,00:01:31.12,>> PROBST: And Judd doubted his new alliance.
35,00:01:37.21,00:01:37.21,">> My biggest concern right now, of course, is Jamie and"
36,00:01:40.08,00:01:40.08,Stephenie not being as loyal as they say they are.
37,00:01:42.58,00:01:42.58,"So, when I go to Tribal Council, I don't know who I'm going to"
38,00:01:44.71,00:01:44.71,"choose. >> PROBST: But in the end, Judd"
39,00:01:47.96,00:01:47.96,turned his back on his former tribe mates and helped vote out
40,00:01:50.50,00:01:50.50,"Brooke. Brooke, the tribe has spoken."
41,00:01:55.08,00:01:55.08,14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

46,00:03:14.29,00:03:14.29,"go there ever again. >> At Tribal Council, Brooke got"
47,00:03:25.12,00:03:25.12,voted out. It was me who went the opposite
48,00:03:28.46,00:03:28.46,"of what my tribe went. You know, I'm feeling good about"
49,00:03:31.54,00:03:31.54,it. It's every man for himself out
50,00:03:34.54,00:03:34.54,"here. You know, you do have to"
51,00:03:37.04,00:03:37.04,"remember that it is a cutthroat game, so..."
52,00:03:41.17,00:03:41.17,">> And you're absolutely right, Judd."
53,00:03:42.88,00:03:42.88,">> So, I mean, you can't throw everybody on an island and play"
54,00:03:45.42,00:03:45.42,"this game. It's a tough game, man."
55,00:03:47.00,00:03:47.00,>> It absolutely is. >> We're all here to play a game
56,00:03:49.79,00:03:49.79,and we're all here to win a million dollars.
57,00:03:51.71,00:03:51.71,>> Right. >> And whichever way we do it
58,00:03:53.92,00:03:53.92,and how we do it is up to us. >> I'm just really sad at what
59,00:03:57.42,00:03:57.42,Judd has done. Judd flipped the very first day
60,00:04:01.25,00:04:01.25,"the new tribe came to be, and he didn't bother to look back."
61,00:04:05.25,00:04:05.25,He's a traitor. >> Now that is an inappropriate
62,00:04:12.67,00:04:12.67,"statement. >> I mean, because they're not"
63,00:04:14.92,00:04:14.92,in my shoes and they're not playing the game I'm playing.
64,00:04:17.04,00:04:17.04,"It's a tough game, man. As long as my wife and my"
65,00:04:19.62,00:04:19.62,"daughter and my family love me, that's all that matters to me,"
66,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,baby. The only thing that matters to
67,00:04:25.25,00:04:25.25,me. I want to see how it plays out.
68,00:04:27.46,00:04:27.46,I hope my alliance stays the way it is.
69,00:04:30.08,00:04:30.08,"Margaret, she's probably not too happy with it, but I really"
70,00:04:32.21,00:04:32.21,don't care whether she's happy or not.
71,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,"I can't wait until she goes, too."
72,00:05:04.29,00:05:04.29,">> This morning I'm sitting here thinking about, you know, how am"
73,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,I sitting in this game right now and what chances do I have at
74,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,this point? I think I've got a pretty good
75,00:05:13.29,00:05:13.29,"chance. The group I have over here, with"
76,00:05:15.29,00:05:15.29,"Yaxha, there's seven of us and four of us from the original"
77,00:05:18.04,00:05:18.04,"Nakum: Bobby Jon, Brandon, Danni and I."
78,00:05:22.04,00:05:22.04,I don't think it could have worked out better.
79,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,We came over here with the new Yaxha tribe.
80,00:05:26.92,00:05:26.92,We have the odds. Gary and Brian and Amy are
81,00:05:29.08,00:05:29.08,"amazing, but they've got to know they got a target on their back"
82,00:05:32.71,00:05:32.71,if we lose. So I'm liking my odds right now.
83,00:05:37.25,00:05:37.25,>> Aah! What is that? >> It's a beetle.
84,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67,>> Get it out of here. Get it the ... out of here!
85,00:05:42.50,00:05:42.50,I don't want it near me. >> It's chasing you.
86,00:05:44.54,00:05:44.54,">> Whoa, it landed right on your shoulder."
87,00:05:46.25,00:05:46.25,">> Get it off, get it off! >> I'm just joking with you."
88,00:05:49.21,00:05:49.21,>> I didn't know beetles could fly.
89,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,>> They're magical beetles here. >> It sounded like a helicopter.
90,00:05:56.17,00:05:56.17,"I was like, what is that? >> Amy, she lived her whole life"
91,00:05:59.46,00:05:59.46,in the city. She said she's never been
92,00:06:01.08,00:06:01.08,camping or anything. I don't know. I'm from Kansas.
93,00:06:06.33,00:06:06.33,"The great state of Kansas. And I don't know, I'm used to"
94,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,"more farming type of people-- maybe the rednecks, the hicks,"
95,00:06:14.42,00:06:14.42,"you know, that kind of people. >> What do you farm?"
96,00:06:18.50,00:06:18.50,">> Wheat, milo, soybeans. >> So then, when you go and it's"
97,00:06:22.42,00:06:22.42,"done, you go and pull it out? With my new Yaxha tribe, a lot"
98,00:06:27.71,00:06:27.71,of people are constantly talking about farm stuff.
99,00:06:29.92,00:06:29.92,"I have no idea. Wheat, what do you do with it?"
100,00:06:32.38,00:06:32.38,>> Wheat? Wheat's used for bread...
101,00:06:34.42,00:06:34.42,">> No, I know what it's used for, but how do you..."
102,00:06:36.75,00:06:36.75,Tell me about the process. >> If you go out there and get a
103,00:06:40.25,00:06:40.25,planter and you put a bunch of seed in your planter...
104,00:06:42.17,00:06:42.17,">> I'm like from the city, so, when they talk about farming and"
105,00:06:46.00,00:06:46.00,"stuff, I definitely am the odd man out."
106,00:06:48.33,00:06:48.33,>> You got little plows in front of it and you got seed bins in
107,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,the back. >> We prefer John Deere.
108,00:06:55.42,00:06:55.42,>> John Deere. >> Most of these people I
109,00:06:58.04,00:06:58.04,probably wouldn't be friends with outside of the game.
110,00:07:00.75,00:07:00.75,"They come from different parts of the country, you know."
111,00:07:02.58,00:07:02.58,"I'm very New England, I'm very blue state, and they're very"
112,00:07:05.25,00:07:05.25,"Texas and, you know, they're from Tulsa, Oklahoma, or..."
113,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,it's just not my style. >> Wow.
114,00:07:17.88,00:07:17.88,"You know, they're good people, so I don't dislike them at all."
115,00:07:19.92,00:07:19.92,But they're just not the kind of people I'm used to hanging out
116,00:07:22.46,00:07:22.46,"with. >> Dear Heavenly Father, in"
117,00:07:25.04,00:07:25.04,"Jesus' name, Lord, we thank You for this day, thank You for"
118,00:07:27.92,00:07:27.92,"every day out here, Lord. >> Our tribe is a very religious"
119,00:07:30.88,00:07:30.88,tribe. We say grace before every meal.
120,00:07:32.96,00:07:32.96,We pray before every challenge. We thank Jesus for everything.
121,00:07:36.25,00:07:36.25,"You know, and I'm not a religious person at all."
122,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,"But I'm not going to object to it, that would be stupid."
123,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,"You'd be stupid to say, like, you know what, guys?"
124,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,"I don't want to thank Jesus for this meal, thanks."
125,00:07:46.12,00:07:46.12,Because then they'd vote me right out-- that's dumb.
126,00:07:48.17,00:07:48.17,"Even if I object to something, you have to grin and bear it."
127,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,That's the strategy out here. >> Amen.
128,00:07:53.08,00:07:53.08,>> Amen. >> Thank you.
129,00:08:00.25,00:08:00.25,">> PROBST: Yaxha, come on in. Nakum, come on in."
130,00:08:12.38,00:08:12.38,"Yaxha, getting your first look at the new Nakum tribe."
131,00:08:15.62,00:08:15.62,Brooke voted out at the last Tribal Council.
132,00:08:23.50,00:08:23.50,"Tell me about life at Nakum. Steph, what's the water"
133,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,situation? >> We can't go in the water.
134,00:08:29.67,00:08:29.67,"The water is very muddy and murky, so we just dump the"
135,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,bucket over our heads to try to stay cool.
136,00:08:34.08,00:08:34.08,>> PROBST: It's been over 100 degrees every single day we've
137,00:08:36.08,00:08:36.08,been out here. The only relief you have is that
138,00:08:38.08,00:08:38.08,"water. >> It's miserable heat out here,"
139,00:08:40.08,00:08:40.08,"Jeff. I mean, it sucks life out of"
140,00:08:41.71,00:08:41.71,you. Not to be able to just dive in
141,00:08:43.21,00:08:43.21,and swim around in that pretty green water is a bummer.
142,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,"We float in, we sit in waist deep and splash water on"
143,00:08:48.79,00:08:48.79,ourselves and just kind of enjoy the beach.
144,00:08:51.21,00:08:51.21,">> There was a croc five feet from our dock, so I'm always"
145,00:08:53.79,00:08:53.79,like bitching for them to get back in.
146,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,">> PROBST: Wait, this is news to me. You've seen a croc?"
147,00:08:57.79,00:08:57.79,>> I saw one this morning. >> PROBST: You saw one this
148,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,morning? >> I got up this morning to
149,00:09:01.25,00:09:01.25,watch the sunrise and one swam right on the shoreline.
150,00:09:03.08,00:09:03.08,"He came out. I just watched the five, six-"
151,00:09:05.71,00:09:05.71,foot crocodile swim out to the big part of the lake.
152,00:09:08.42,00:09:08.42,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to today's challenge."
153,00:09:10.96,00:09:10.96,It is for reward. Here's how it works.
154,00:09:13.12,00:09:13.12,"On my go, both tribes will race to the first station where one"
155,00:09:16.08,00:09:16.08,"tribe member will cut through a rope using a sharp stone, just"
156,00:09:20.96,00:09:20.96,like the ancient Maya would have.
157,00:09:23.25,00:09:23.25,"Once you cut through the rope, you'll release two hammers."
158,00:09:25.58,00:09:25.58,"Untie them, take them with you to the second station where"
159,00:09:28.21,00:09:28.21,a different tribe member will chop through a log to a second
160,00:09:31.71,00:09:31.71,rope. Once you've chopped through the
161,00:09:34.21,00:09:34.21,"log and the rope, you'll release two more handles."
162,00:09:37.33,00:09:37.33,"You now have four handles. Take those with you, race up the"
163,00:09:40.38,00:09:40.38,"platform, where four different tribe members will take the"
164,00:09:44.17,00:09:44.17,handles and put them in a turnstile and begin cranking it.
165,00:09:47.96,00:09:47.96,"As you crank that turnstile, you will bring a cart up the hill,"
166,00:09:52.21,00:09:52.21,"closer and closer toward you. Once that cart reaches the top,"
167,00:09:56.25,00:09:56.25,all six tribe members who have participated thus far get in the
168,00:09:59.21,00:09:59.21,cart. That leaves one tribe member
169,00:10:02.12,00:10:02.12,"left. Their sole responsibility, take"
170,00:10:04.38,00:10:04.38,"a machete, chop the final rope; that will release the cart and"
171,00:10:07.38,00:10:07.38,"send it screaming down the hill. >> Oh, my gosh."
172,00:10:10.96,00:10:10.96,>> PROBST: First tribe to the finish wins reward.
173,00:10:12.96,00:10:12.96,Want to know what you're playing for?
174,00:10:15.08,00:10:15.08,">> Yes, sir! >> PROBST: Very few things can"
175,00:10:17.67,00:10:17.67,take the edge off of an unbearably hot day.
176,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,"This is certainly one of them. For the winners, margaritas,"
177,00:10:26.79,00:10:26.79,"chip and dip with guacamole. Granted, it would be nice if you"
178,00:10:31.12,00:10:31.12,"could go back to a refreshing body of water, as if there"
179,00:10:33.67,00:10:33.67,"weren't crocs-- make it a little better, wouldn't it?"
180,00:10:36.38,00:10:36.38,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Second part of the
181,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50,"reward for the winning tribe, a floating, crocodile-proof swim"
182,00:10:43.17,00:10:43.17,cage. >> Yes!
183,00:10:46.25,00:10:46.25,">> PROBST: Delivered to your camp, complete with decking,"
184,00:10:48.62,00:10:48.62,"lounge chairs and an umbrella. >> Oh, my gosh."
185,00:10:54.12,00:10:54.12,>> Just for today? >> PROBST: Stays at your camp.

193,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,hacking at it. He's through the first rope very
194,00:11:22.54,00:11:22.54,"quickly. Brandon's got a strategy, using"
195,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,some leverage. Jamie's still working on that
196,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,first rope. Time is critical at this first
197,00:11:30.17,00:11:30.17,station. Lose it and it's hard to make
198,00:11:32.21,00:11:32.21,"up. >> Got it, Jamie! Come on!"
199,00:11:34.50,00:11:34.50,>> PROBST: Jamie still on the first rope.
200,00:11:36.17,00:11:36.17,Brandon on the second rope. Brandon has it.

202,00:11:48.71,00:11:48.71,Bobby Jon quickly gets to work on the log.
203,00:11:51.58,00:11:51.58,Yaxha with a big lead. Jamie's still back on the first
204,00:11:54.21,00:11:54.21,"rope, losing a lot of time for Nakum."
205,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,>> Come on! >> Switch rocks if you have to.
206,00:11:59.08,00:11:59.08,">> Come on, Jamie. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon getting"

209,00:12:05.12,00:12:05.12,Jamie having a heck of a time. Bobby Jon nearly through.

211,00:12:13.92,00:12:13.92,"Bobby, come on, Bobby! >> PROBST: Bobby Jon releases"
212,00:12:16.04,00:12:16.04,the second batch of handles. Jamie through the first rope.

216,00:12:30.38,00:12:30.38,>> PROBST: Yaxha really wants this reward and has a huge lead.
217,00:12:34.54,00:12:34.54,Jamie still back at the first station.
218,00:12:37.75,00:12:37.75,"Nakum very frustrated. >> Go, Yaxha!"
219,00:12:40.67,00:12:40.67,">> PROBST: Yaxha-- margaritas, chip and dip, cage to swim in."

222,00:12:52.25,00:12:52.25,One of the biggest blowouts thus far in Survivor: Guatemala.
223,00:12:55.58,00:12:55.58,That cart getting closer and closer for Yaxha.
224,00:13:00.67,00:13:00.67,"Jamie not giving up, but not anywhere close to finishing."
225,00:13:03.67,00:13:03.67,">> Keep going, buddy. >> PROBST: Judd's turned his"
226,00:13:05.83,00:13:05.83,"back. >> Bang it, man!"
227,00:13:07.38,00:13:07.38,>> PROBST: Yaxha very close. Two more pulls and they'll be
228,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,there. >> Come on!

236,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,">> Good work, Jamie. >> Y'all wanna finish?"
237,00:13:46.92,00:13:46.92,">> It's okay, Jamie. >> You just untie this and..."
238,00:13:50.12,00:13:50.12,>> Just leave it go. >> Y'all want to quit?
239,00:13:52.29,00:13:52.29,">> Jamie, the challenge is over. >> We're not quitting."
240,00:13:55.08,00:13:55.08,"We're done. >> You finished the job, guy."
241,00:13:59.12,00:13:59.12,You finished. >> I'm good.
242,00:14:01.04,00:14:01.04,">> Sorry, guys. >> PROBST: Yaxha, great victory."
243,00:14:04.92,00:14:04.92,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: Great reward:
244,00:14:08.54,00:14:08.54,"Pitcher of margaritas, chips, healthy portion of dip, swim"
245,00:14:13.75,00:14:13.75,"cage with a deck, lounge chairs, umbrella-- should make for a"
246,00:14:17.25,00:14:17.25,"nice, refreshing afternoon. Congratulations."
247,00:14:21.50,00:14:21.50,"Nakum, an absolute blowout. Jamie, it falls on you."
248,00:14:28.04,00:14:28.04,"Head on back to camp. >> Oh, yeah."
249,00:14:43.33,00:14:43.33,">> Oh, yeah! Oh, man, look, at this!"
250,00:14:48.83,00:14:48.83,">> Oh, yeah. >> Whoo! Is that awesome."
251,00:14:52.38,00:14:52.38,"Today, Yaxha, we're superstars. >> This is amazing."
252,00:14:55.58,00:14:55.58,"The reward was spectacular. Look at this setup, man!"
253,00:15:00.71,00:15:00.71,"Oh, my God! >> No crocodiles in that water."
254,00:15:03.71,00:15:03.71,">> Oh, man! I'm so excited about the dang"
255,00:15:07.21,00:15:07.21,"thing. It's a huge pool with, like,"
256,00:15:10.17,00:15:10.17,lounge chairs. The whole thing is caged in.
257,00:15:12.71,00:15:12.71,I thought it was going to be like one cage for one person.
258,00:15:14.92,00:15:14.92,We all fit in there. I didn't imagine it was going to
259,00:15:17.25,00:15:17.25,"be that good. >> Jackpot, baby!"
260,00:15:19.38,00:15:19.38,>> Take everything on it and enjoy.
261,00:15:22.17,00:15:22.17,>> Cheers. >> Cheers.
262,00:15:24.08,00:15:24.08,">> God. >> Brandon, you kick butt."
263,00:15:25.62,00:15:25.62,>> He made that contest not even fun.
264,00:15:27.25,00:15:27.25,">> Man, I was hacking at that rope."
265,00:15:28.54,00:15:28.54,I was just practically bashing it apart.
266,00:15:31.54,00:15:31.54,You could say that I won it for Yaxha.
267,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,"I mean, I'm not trying to take all the credit or anything."
268,00:15:37.58,00:15:37.58,"But gotta go in there and give it 110 percent, you know..."
269,00:15:41.17,00:15:41.17,Give it your all. >> Why didn't anybody on the
270,00:15:45.67,00:15:45.67,other team tell Jamie to chop? >> I don't know.
271,00:15:48.33,00:15:48.33,">> Not one of them said ""chop."" Brandon used that rock like"
272,00:15:50.67,00:15:50.67,an ax on that rope. We've got a new superhero on our
273,00:15:52.88,00:15:52.88,team. I know Kansas is loving him and
274,00:15:55.04,00:15:55.04,so am I. >> This is to kicking ass and
275,00:15:58.04,00:15:58.04,"staying... ( all whooping, shouting )"
276,00:16:02.25,00:16:02.25,">> Yaxha, baby! >> There you go, Brian."
277,00:16:06.62,00:16:06.62,">> Oh, my God. God, to just, like, sink into"
278,00:16:10.38,00:16:10.38,"the water... no, but I got to keep eating."
279,00:16:13.21,00:16:13.21,I can't go in yet. We are having an amazing day.
280,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,Yaxha is on cloud nine right now.
281,00:16:18.33,00:16:18.33,">> Oh, man, Gary goes all in! How deep is that?"
282,00:16:22.92,00:16:22.92,">> Oh, my God, this is the best. ( all laughing, shouting )"
283,00:16:30.58,00:16:30.58,">> The Guatemalan sun, 120 degrees, it's a killer out here."
284,00:16:33.67,00:16:33.67,We've been wanting to swim for the longest time.
285,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,I'm a fish back home. I love the water.
286,00:16:39.46,00:16:39.46,"So to be able to swim, even in a tiny square... is heaven."
287,00:16:46.46,00:16:46.46,">> One, two, three, Yaxha! ( all whooping )"
288,00:16:55.92,00:16:55.92,>> There was no way in hell you were going to bang it with that
289,00:16:58.62,00:16:58.62,"little rock, so... >> I could, like, I tried to"
290,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50,"bang it. It wouldn't bang, you know."
291,00:17:03.12,00:17:03.12,>> Don't worry about it. >> That kid was an animal though
292,00:17:05.12,00:17:05.12,"with that thing. It was a hard challenge, you"
293,00:17:07.12,00:17:07.12,"know? I just feel bad to lose, you"
294,00:17:08.67,00:17:08.67,know? That was a good reward and I
295,00:17:10.17,00:17:10.17,lost it. But no one could cut rope as
296,00:17:11.67,00:17:11.67,quick as Brandon can. I take all of the blame.
297,00:17:15.38,00:17:15.38,>> You did the best you could and that's all the tribe asks.
298,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,">> That's it, brother. That's it, Jamie."
299,00:17:20.08,00:17:20.08,>> You did a great job. >> Jamie apologized to
300,00:17:22.79,00:17:22.79,"everybody, but I can see in people's faces that they..."
301,00:17:26.17,00:17:26.17,"it's just like, man, what the hell, what the hell did he do,"
302,00:17:29.38,00:17:29.38,man? We just got our asses kicked.
303,00:17:35.00,00:17:35.00,"You know, we're a team, man. You can't fall apart."
304,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,You can't blame anybody. A team doesn't work like that.
305,00:17:40.12,00:17:40.12,"Jamie, he tried every freakin' thing he could do."
306,00:17:43.12,00:17:43.12,"What are you gonna do, man? >> None of us could have done"
307,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,anything more. >> I just thought it was going
308,00:17:55.17,00:17:55.17,"to take... I knew the technique, but I thought..."
309,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,">> Well, if you know the technique, then you got to step"
310,00:17:59.96,00:17:59.96,"up, man. >> No, but I don't have the"
311,00:18:01.67,00:18:01.67,shoulder and upper body strength that you or Jamie would have.
312,00:18:03.62,00:18:03.62,">> I'm just saying, by all means, if you and Margaret ever"
313,00:18:05.75,00:18:05.75,"want to step up to the plate, man, be my guest, man."
314,00:18:08.50,00:18:08.50,You step up to the damn plate and you do what you gotta do and
315,00:18:11.08,00:18:11.08,get one of us out of the spot... >> I understand.
316,00:18:14.46,00:18:14.46,"If you think you can do better, then do it-- right."
317,00:18:16.08,00:18:16.08,">> You go at it, man. >> I understand that."
318,00:18:17.58,00:18:17.58,>> Get us out of the spotlight for a little bit and shine like
319,00:18:19.79,00:18:19.79,"the star that you think you are. That's it, man."
320,00:18:21.58,00:18:21.58,That's all I'm saying. >> When we got back from the
321,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,"challenge, Judd was mouthing off about if you think you can"
322,00:18:26.54,00:18:26.54,"do something better, it's time to step up, don't put all the"
323,00:18:28.62,00:18:28.62,weight on all the guys. So it made me really mad.
324,00:18:31.08,00:18:31.08,Some of these people are just going out of their way to
325,00:18:33.71,00:18:33.71,"irritate the other ones, and I just don't think that's a very"
326,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,smart thing. >> Bobby Jon's in the cart
327,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"kicking his legs, cheering like a frickin' girl."
328,00:18:43.25,00:18:43.25,"I wanted to knock him out. I'm happy for Bobby Jon, that"
329,00:18:46.04,00:18:46.04,"he's winning, because I know how it is to lose, and it sucks."
330,00:18:49.08,00:18:49.08,But it annoys me when I watch him win.
331,00:18:52.12,00:18:52.12,"He cheers like a freakin' girl. So, I think it's obnoxious."
332,00:18:55.21,00:18:55.21,"And I think... I'm jealous, basically."
333,00:18:59.75,00:18:59.75,He's so gay. He gets so gay.
334,00:19:02.50,00:19:02.50,I can't stand it. >> He's overly dramatic.
335,00:19:05.00,00:19:05.00,">> Right, like, get over it. >> I didn't know how to cut that"
336,00:19:10.42,00:19:10.42,"rope that way. >> Can't do it all, kid."
337,00:19:16.21,00:19:16.21,">> No, no way. >> Jamie is a very cocky kind of"
338,00:19:18.58,00:19:18.58,"guy. He's, like, ""I can cut rope with"
339,00:19:21.21,00:19:21.21,"a rock, no problem. I can fly right through that."""
340,00:19:23.92,00:19:23.92,And he gets in there and gets his ass beat by a 22-year-old
341,00:19:26.58,00:19:26.58,"farm boy who basically saws through the rope in, like, 30"
342,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,seconds. They get the whole challenge
343,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,done and frickin' Jamie can't even cut the second rope.
344,00:19:35.00,00:19:35.00,You don't have to make it that thin.
345,00:19:36.54,00:19:36.54,"I'm just pissed. I mean, I'm sick of losing."
346,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,"I can't do this again, but I am just trying really hard, when"
347,00:19:42.12,00:19:42.12,"I'm up in camp, to keep my mouth shut."
348,00:19:44.29,00:19:44.29,"I'm never going to cry in front of any of them, ever."
349,00:19:48.17,00:19:48.17,"I'm never going to tell them how I really feel, but deep down in"
350,00:19:51.29,00:19:51.29,"me, my heart is breaking. I mean, inside, I'm like"
351,00:19:55.21,00:19:55.21,collapsing really. Whew!
352,00:20:00.29,00:20:00.29,I just feel like I'm a really bad...
353,00:20:02.83,00:20:02.83,"I'm in a really bad dream and I can't get out, no matter what."
354,00:20:17.38,00:20:17.38,( thunder crashing ) >> Whoa!
355,00:20:22.17,00:20:22.17,">> Oh, my God. >> I do not want to relive what"
356,00:20:25.08,00:20:25.08,I just went through on Palau. And the same thing is happening
357,00:20:29.38,00:20:29.38,"over again. For some reason, the group I'm"
358,00:20:32.12,00:20:32.12,"always in is the less able group, and the group that"
359,00:20:38.00,00:20:38.00,basically... sucks. >> It's been raining for a
360,00:21:06.71,00:21:06.71,"couple hours, maybe an hour or something like that."
361,00:21:10.58,00:21:10.58,We're huddled under a frickin' umbrella and it sucks.
362,00:21:20.46,00:21:20.46,">> Somehow, Brian and Blake are still sleeping, man, under the"
363,00:21:25.29,00:21:25.29,"shelter that we've got, and we couldn't sleep under it worth a"
364,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,"damn, and somehow, those guys haven't come out yet."
365,00:21:30.79,00:21:30.79,Either they found a dry spot or they're just beefing through the
366,00:21:34.33,00:21:34.33,wetness and the rain. >> Golden boy.
367,00:21:39.88,00:21:39.88,">> Golden boy. >> It's like, \xe2\x99\xaa ahh... \xe2\x99\xaa"
368,00:21:42.96,00:21:42.96,I came up with the name Golden Boy for Blake 'cause he always
369,00:21:44.92,00:21:44.92,comes up smelling like roses. He's going to make out great in
370,00:21:47.75,00:21:47.75,"life, you know? That's just him."
371,00:21:50.12,00:21:50.12,"Plus, he also has the greatest stories."
372,00:21:54.12,00:21:54.12,>> I started skydiving... >> Really?
373,00:21:56.17,00:21:56.17,">> Yeah, I've got about 70 skydives in."
374,00:21:58.67,00:21:58.67,State champion tennis player in high school...
375,00:22:00.88,00:22:00.88,Now I'm 24 and not married. I was dating a lot and now
376,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,"I have a girlfriend, a pretty amazing girl."
377,00:22:05.92,00:22:05.92,"I see a lot of older women, and that kind of got me in trouble"
378,00:22:08.17,00:22:08.17,"for a while. So it was like, I slowed that"
379,00:22:10.08,00:22:10.08,down and... >> Blake talks about himself all
380,00:22:13.00,00:22:13.00,"the time. All this, you know, he seems"
381,00:22:15.08,00:22:15.08,like Captain America. He's always talking himself up.
382,00:22:17.54,00:22:17.54,"It's like, you know, God. >> My girlfriend, she's got"
383,00:22:21.54,00:22:21.54,double D. She's got big boobs.
384,00:22:25.17,00:22:25.17,>> Really? >> But then she got the pill and
385,00:22:27.38,00:22:27.38,"they get bigger. Geez, they just keep growing."
386,00:22:30.71,00:22:30.71,"They were D's and now, they're like almost double D's."
387,00:22:32.54,00:22:32.54,">> Man, that's too big. That's gross."
388,00:22:34.75,00:22:34.75,>> I'm not even a boob man. Bobby Jon and I were talking.
389,00:22:36.88,00:22:36.88,We're legs and ass kind of guys. Brandon?
390,00:22:40.79,00:22:40.79,">> Novelty-size boobs, I don't know about that."
391,00:22:44.33,00:22:44.33,">> Anyway, we went to Victoria's Secret..."
392,00:22:46.21,00:22:46.21,>> Blake is such an idiot. He has to make himself look like
393,00:22:49.08,00:22:49.08,"such a pretty boy, frat boy, wealthy boy-- it's great."
394,00:22:51.42,00:22:51.42,I have a new favorite game out here.
395,00:22:53.88,00:22:53.88,"It's called ""Bait Blake."" Blake, what is your absolute"
396,00:22:57.04,00:22:57.04,"best drunk story? >> Oh, God."
397,00:23:00.75,00:23:00.75,"My roommate-- we were all gone all summer at camp, I thought"
398,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,"I'd have a party at my place. We're doing shots, everybody's"
399,00:23:06.25,00:23:06.25,getting hammered... >> I'm trying to make sure he
400,00:23:08.75,00:23:08.75,tells all his stories around people like Danni and Bobby Jon
401,00:23:11.38,00:23:11.38,so they see what a moron Blake is.
402,00:23:13.25,00:23:13.25,"This is awesome. >> So what you're saying, Blake,"
403,00:23:15.58,00:23:15.58,is that I wouldn't want one of my three daughters to date you?
404,00:23:17.88,00:23:17.88,">> No, no. I'm pretty feisty, Gary."
405,00:23:20.96,00:23:20.96,You wouldn't want 'em anywhere near me.
406,00:23:22.58,00:23:22.58,">> He's just digging himself into a hole, and I am gonna do"
407,00:23:25.04,00:23:25.04,everything I can to make sure he has a shovel.
408,00:23:27.04,00:23:27.04,">> Yeah. >> Uh-oh, tree mail."
409,00:23:43.38,00:23:43.38,">> Oh, geez. >> Look like something Hercules"
410,00:23:47.46,00:23:47.46,would throw over the head. >> Maybe we have to throw that.
411,00:23:50.46,00:23:50.46,">> ( hooting ) >> ""Half your bodies, half your"

414,00:24:02.25,00:24:02.25,"Race around, push and shove, Will old friends be respected?"
415,00:24:06.08,00:24:06.08,"Fail to catch immunity, you may be the next one here ejected."""
416,00:24:10.62,00:24:10.62,We just got tree mail. It looks like it's going to be
417,00:24:13.96,00:24:13.96,very strenuous. I have unfortunately seemed to
418,00:24:16.67,00:24:16.67,"have been on one tribe that was on a losing streak, and now I"
419,00:24:19.12,00:24:19.12,got switched up and I'm on another tribe that just recently
420,00:24:21.88,00:24:21.88,lost. So I'm trying to get this bad
421,00:24:25.00,00:24:25.00,luck that is dwelling over my head away from me.
422,00:24:28.08,00:24:28.08,">> Are we ready, guys? Are we psyched?"
423,00:24:29.83,00:24:29.83,>> I'm ready. >> Yeah.
424,00:24:31.88,00:24:31.88,\xe2\x99\xaa Here we come to save the day! The Nakum tribe is on their way.
425,00:24:38.08,00:24:38.08,\xe2\x99\xaa Here we come to save the day! And I will cut some fruits for
426,00:24:42.38,00:24:42.38,you. \xe2\x99\xaa >> Lydia's drunk.
427,00:24:44.96,00:24:44.96,">> So many things have been, you know, getting us down and out"
428,00:24:48.71,00:24:48.71,lately. And this morning I got up and I
429,00:24:51.92,00:24:51.92,"said to myself, you know, forget about all this crap about being"
430,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,"down and out. You know, I'm going to be a"
431,00:24:57.92,00:24:57.92,"motivated person today. Oh, disappeared."
432,00:25:00.88,00:25:00.88,"( laughing ) You know, let's party on."
433,00:25:03.88,00:25:03.88,"Listen, it's miserable out here. Mosquitoes everywhere and..."
434,00:25:10.42,00:25:10.42,Do the pancake! ( rhythmic singing )
435,00:25:13.88,00:25:13.88,">> Whip it, whip it, whip it! >> Go, Rafe, go, Rafe, go Rafe!"
436,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,">> And flip it... >> Do it now, uh-huh."
437,00:25:24.12,00:25:24.12,>> What the hell happened to you between yesterday and today?
438,00:25:27.04,00:25:27.04,Where is Lydia and when do we get her back?
439,00:25:29.83,00:25:29.83,">> We need a little bit of that this morning, don't you think?"
440,00:25:32.67,00:25:32.67,">> You look like you're having a seizure, though."
441,00:25:34.58,00:25:34.58,">> Elvis may be the king of rock 'n' roll, but I'm the queen."
442,00:25:36.58,00:25:36.58,Whoo! Shut up.
443,00:25:37.92,00:25:37.92,"( laughing ) >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
444,00:25:58.88,00:25:58.88,How's everybody doing? >> Great.
445,00:26:01.46,00:26:01.46,">> PROBST: Danni, how is this tribe doing as a group?"
446,00:26:04.08,00:26:04.08,>> We're having a great time. Swimming by the pool has really
447,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,brought us all together. We're really doing...
448,00:26:09.33,00:26:09.33,"We're doing great. >> PROBST: Nakum, nobody is"
449,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,"smiling. Jamie looks irritated, Judd"
450,00:26:14.29,00:26:14.29,"looks frustrated, Margaret looks ticked off."
451,00:26:17.08,00:26:17.08,"That's just what I'm seeing. Am I wrong, Jamie?"
452,00:26:19.21,00:26:19.21,>> We're hungry for the win. We're not smiling until we win.
453,00:26:21.21,00:26:21.21,We're mad right now. >> PROBST: The reason I asked
454,00:26:24.00,00:26:24.00,"about how you guys are getting along, is that is critical in"
455,00:26:26.00,00:26:26.00,today's challenge. You have to work well together.
456,00:26:29.12,00:26:29.12,The tribe that does that the best will win immunity.
457,00:26:31.58,00:26:31.58,"The tribe that doesn't, deservedly, will go to Tribal"
458,00:26:33.96,00:26:33.96,Council and vote somebody out. Let's get to today's immunity
459,00:26:37.12,00:26:37.12,challenge. First things first.
460,00:26:43.21,00:26:43.21,"Immunity, back up for grabs. Here's how today's challenge"
461,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,will work. Each tribe will divide into two
462,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,groups of three. Those groups will take a spot
463,00:26:53.17,00:26:53.17,downfield and you'll be holding a Maya catch net.
464,00:26:56.38,00:26:56.38,That leaves one tribe member from each tribe.
465,00:26:58.75,00:26:58.75,They will alternate launching balls from a catapult downfield
466,00:27:02.96,00:27:02.96,while the groups maneuver to try to catch the ball.
467,00:27:06.21,00:27:06.21,You can catch any ball from either tribe member at any time.
468,00:27:09.71,00:27:09.71,The first tribe with five catches wins immunity.
469,00:27:13.17,00:27:13.17,"Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home."
470,00:27:16.17,00:27:16.17,Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started.
471,00:27:25.25,00:27:25.25,"Brian is launcher for Yaxha, Lydia for Nakum."
472,00:27:29.83,00:27:29.83,Brian's up first. Makes his selection.
473,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,Places the ball in the trough. He is locked and loaded.
474,00:27:39.21,00:27:39.21,"Once the ball is in the air, you can leave your mat."
475,00:27:42.42,00:27:42.42,Brian takes his aim far right. And he launches.
476,00:27:48.75,00:27:48.75,"Heading towards Bobby Jon, Gary and Danni."
477,00:27:52.33,00:27:52.33,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Score for Yaxha.
478,00:27:55.08,00:27:55.08,">> Good job, Yaxha. >> PROBST: Yaxha leads."
479,00:27:57.79,00:27:57.79,"One, zip. Lydia takes her first shot."
480,00:28:01.17,00:28:01.17,">> Come on, Lydia! >> PROBST: Lydia takes a spot at"
481,00:28:03.83,00:28:03.83,"the catapult, takes a little aim."
482,00:28:07.17,00:28:07.17,Her first shot and it's launched.
483,00:28:11.92,00:28:11.92,"It's deep. >> Right, right, right."
484,00:28:14.54,00:28:14.54,">> PROBST: Oh, Yaxha had a shot at it, couldn't do it."
485,00:28:16.50,00:28:16.50,">> You guys, we gotta be a little faster."
486,00:28:18.08,00:28:18.08,"Yeah, but I got to box it, too, man."
487,00:28:19.71,00:28:19.71,">> I know, but listen to me, because it's going deep."
488,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,"They'll never get near us. >> PROBST: Steph, Judd and Rafe"
489,00:28:24.25,00:28:24.25,talking it through. Brian's up.
490,00:28:28.83,00:28:28.83,Brian takes his aim. And he launches high and short.
491,00:28:34.71,00:28:34.71,">> Got it, got it, got it! Got it, got it, got it!"
492,00:28:38.38,00:28:38.38,">> PROBST: Nakum steals one. Judd, Rafe and Steph!"
493,00:28:41.42,00:28:41.42,"We're tied, one-one. Playing to five."
494,00:28:45.83,00:28:45.83,"Lydia. >> All the way, Lydia."
495,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,>> PROBST: Lydia going right back to the same spot.
496,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,And it's in the air. The tribes moving.
497,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,Brandon hits the deck. Nobody gets it.
498,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,Good defense by Yaxha. >> It's all right.
499,00:29:03.08,00:29:03.08,>> PROBST: Still tied. Brian up.
500,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,">> Turn it as much as you can, Bri."
501,00:29:07.50,00:29:07.50,">> I got it. >> You guys, get ready to back"
502,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50,"up, they're on the left. >> PROBST: Brian takes his aim,"
503,00:29:12.33,00:29:12.33,far right. He launches it quickly towards
504,00:29:15.75,00:29:15.75,"Gary, Danni and Bobby Jon. But they can't connect."
505,00:29:19.50,00:29:19.50,Stephenie plowed into Bobby Jon. >> They didn't catch it.
506,00:29:23.92,00:29:23.92,>> PROBST: Lydia going back to the same spot.
507,00:29:28.00,00:29:28.00,"Lydia launches one deep toward Rafe, Judd and Steph..."
508,00:29:32.54,00:29:32.54,and they connect! >> Yes!
509,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,"Nakum leads, two-one. Brian up for Yaxha."
510,00:29:49.67,00:29:49.67,Yaxha connects. Yaxha ties it up.
511,00:29:53.12,00:29:53.12,"Two, two. >> Good job, Bri."
512,00:29:55.62,00:29:55.62,">> PROBST: Lydia, quick aim. She launches."
513,00:30:00.79,00:30:00.79,It's deep. Nakum could get it.
514,00:30:04.08,00:30:04.08,And they do. >> Whoo! Yeah!
515,00:30:06.38,00:30:06.38,">> Good shot, Lydia! >> PROBST: Nakum back in the"
516,00:30:08.54,00:30:08.54,"lead, three, two. Brian up."
517,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,"Immunity on the line. >> I'm not looking, I'm just"
518,00:30:15.00,00:30:15.00,"going straight back, you guys. >> PROBST: He launches."
519,00:30:19.71,00:30:19.71,">> Got it, got it, got it. Nakum steals one."
520,00:30:23.33,00:30:23.33,>> Wow! >> Yeah!
521,00:30:26.58,00:30:26.58,">> PROBST: Nakum leads. Four, two."
522,00:30:29.75,00:30:29.75,"Lydia. >> This is it, Nakum."
523,00:30:32.17,00:30:32.17,>> PROBST: Nakum could win it here.
524,00:30:34.12,00:30:34.12,">> Yaxha, knock 'em down. >> PROBST: Yaxha needs to steal"
525,00:30:37.25,00:30:37.25,one. Launches it.
526,00:30:41.04,00:30:41.04,For the win if Nakum gets it... And they do!
527,00:30:47.08,00:30:47.08,Nakum wins immunity! >> Who's smiling now?
528,00:30:51.04,00:30:51.04,Who's smiling now? >> Whoo!
529,00:30:54.46,00:30:54.46,>> Yes! Lydia! Come here! You!
530,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,"You did it! ( whooping, shouting )"
531,00:31:02.71,00:31:02.71,>> Go get that... >> PROBST: Nakum... immunity.
532,00:31:08.96,00:31:08.96,A break from Tribal Council. Hopefully that will lift the
533,00:31:12.38,00:31:12.38,spirits a little bit. Yaxha-- other end of the
534,00:31:16.67,00:31:16.67,"spectrum, somebody going home. You have the afternoon to figure"
535,00:31:19.62,00:31:19.62,out who it's going to be. See you at Tribal.
536,00:31:21.38,00:31:21.38,Head on back. >> It was our time to lose.
537,00:31:44.46,00:31:44.46,">> This doesn't feel very good. >> No, it don't."
538,00:31:47.38,00:31:47.38,">> Jamie's like, ""Who's the baller now?"
539,00:31:49.79,00:31:49.79,"Who's the baller now?"" >> I didn't even hear him say"
540,00:31:52.25,00:31:52.25,"that. >> I'm like, ""Jamie, why don't"
541,00:31:53.96,00:31:53.96,"you just shut up and go cut a rope or something?"""
542,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,>> All that frustration on that rope came out.
543,00:31:59.00,00:31:59.00,">> Uh-huh. >> Oh, that burns me up."
544,00:32:00.71,00:32:00.71,There's a way to win and there's a way to lose.
545,00:32:02.79,00:32:02.79,"He's from Georgia, too. Alabama, Georgia kind of have"
546,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,rivals. >> Really?
547,00:32:07.54,00:32:07.54,">> Yeah. >> We lost immunity, which was"
548,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,disappointing. The Yaxha tribe is going into
549,00:32:12.92,00:32:12.92,Tribal Council tonight with four old Nakum members and three old
550,00:32:16.25,00:32:16.25,Yaxha members. So the math is right there.
551,00:32:18.62,00:32:18.62,It's four to three. So you would think that it would
552,00:32:21.54,00:32:21.54,"be either me, Gary or Amy going tonight, and it very well may"
553,00:32:23.83,00:32:23.83,be. What have you been hearing?
554,00:32:26.54,00:32:26.54,>> Nobody is talking to me. They don't talk about
555,00:32:28.54,00:32:28.54,alliances... I know that Blake's driving
556,00:32:30.62,00:32:30.62,"everybody crazy. >> So, hopefully..."
557,00:32:33.29,00:32:33.29,">> So, I know Danni and Brandon and Bobby Jon are pretty tight"
558,00:32:37.38,00:32:37.38,>> Yeah. We are at risk. I don't know what they're going
559,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,to do. But would you be okay voting for
560,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,"Blake? >> Oh, in a second."
561,00:32:44.54,00:32:44.54,He's driving everybody crazy. >> I really feel like Danni
562,00:32:48.21,00:32:48.21,would vote for Blake before she'd vote for me or you.
563,00:32:52.12,00:32:52.12,">> Yeah, yeah. >> I hope."
564,00:32:53.21,00:32:53.21,>> We've just got to make sure that one of them votes for
565,00:32:55.54,00:32:55.54,"Blake, yeah. >> Okay."
566,00:32:56.67,00:32:56.67,">> Good, good, good. >> This Blake thing, driving"
567,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,everybody crazy has been really good for us Yaxha members.
568,00:33:03.79,00:33:03.79,Our only hope in the game is to get somebody to turn from the
569,00:33:07.58,00:33:07.58,original Nakum against Blake. I just want to see somebody
570,00:33:11.17,00:33:11.17,that's hard-working that has a good attitude win it.
571,00:33:14.21,00:33:14.21,">> Mm-hmm, I feel the same way. >> You know?"
572,00:33:16.12,00:33:16.12,You hate to see somebody get to the final four that doesn't
573,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,deserve it. We just can't let that happen
574,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,"this time. You know, I do agree that's"
575,00:33:28.12,00:33:28.12,"best, though if that needs to happen."
576,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33,"I just don't want to start, you know, going back on words and"
577,00:33:34.00,00:33:34.00,"all that. I've given Blake my word that,"
578,00:33:36.42,00:33:36.42,"you know, I wouldn't vote for him."
579,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,But I listen to Gary a lot because he's smart and he knows
580,00:33:43.50,00:33:43.50,about team unity. I do know there's going to be
581,00:33:46.50,00:33:46.50,"some times where I am going to have to switch my vote, and I"
582,00:33:49.88,00:33:49.88,feel like right now is not one of those times.
583,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,>> Uh-huh. >> I know you're with him from
584,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,the beginning. >> I feel the same way.
585,00:34:03.21,00:34:03.21,>> I talked to Bobby Jon. >> What did he say?
586,00:34:05.08,00:34:05.08,>> He wants to vote for Brian. >> I think maybe Bobby Jon
587,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"thinks we all have an alliance, which we do not."
588,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,None of us were aligned originally.
589,00:34:12.08,00:34:12.08,">> No. At this point in the game, I want good people to go"
590,00:34:15.12,00:34:15.12,forward. >> Yeah.
591,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,>> I want Blake gone first. >> Gary came up to me to talk
592,00:34:20.46,00:34:20.46,about Blake. And Gary just said he couldn't
593,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,"vote for somebody who didn't deserve to go any further, so I"
594,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,said I felt is same way and I just needed to go talk to the
595,00:34:30.71,00:34:30.71,rest of the team. >> Gary swears he's with us.
596,00:34:33.25,00:34:33.25,>> You've talked to him about it?
597,00:34:35.08,00:34:35.08,>> I've talked to him about it. >> I'm going to tell you right
598,00:34:44.00,00:34:44.00,"now, I'm not going to vote for Blake."
599,00:34:46.21,00:34:46.21,"You know, because we're strong. We got 'em... right now. "
600,00:34:48.21,00:34:48.21,"I'm probably going to vote for... I don't know, Amy or"
601,00:34:52.08,00:34:52.08,"Brian. >> Lights come on, pull"
602,00:35:04.12,00:35:04.12,"over, gives us both a warning for not having proper signal"
603,00:35:07.00,00:35:07.00,"devices and whistles. I'm like, dude, we rented these"
604,00:35:09.25,00:35:09.25,for two hours. We don't live here.
605,00:35:10.75,00:35:10.75,"We live in south, downtown Dallas."
606,00:35:12.29,00:35:12.29,">> You know, the whole Blake situation, we're not sure what's"
607,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,going to happen with that. Everybody is getting a little
608,00:35:16.17,00:35:16.17,"fed up with him. I like the guy, he's a good guy."
609,00:35:18.54,00:35:18.54,He's just young and it's just typical frat boy stuff.
610,00:35:21.17,00:35:21.17,I don't like that frat boy stuff at all.
611,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,">> Yeah, the girl I almost lost my virginity to."
612,00:35:26.08,00:35:26.08,So they're... >> But he's really valuable
613,00:35:28.29,00:35:28.29,because he's so athletic. He's great in challenges.
614,00:35:31.88,00:35:31.88,Brandon and Bobby Jon said they wouldn't vote for him.
615,00:35:36.04,00:35:36.04,And so it kind of comes down to my vote.
616,00:35:39.62,00:35:39.62,"And I hate being the swing vote. I mean, it's just... that's a"
617,00:35:43.21,00:35:43.21,part of the game I just don't  like.
618,00:35:45.17,00:35:45.17,"Because it's going to hurt peoples' feelings, but it has to"
619,00:35:48.00,00:35:48.00,happen. Unfortunately it's just the way
620,00:35:49.71,00:35:49.71,it goes sometimes. >> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal
621,00:36:19.12,00:36:19.12,"Council. Before we get started, how bad"
622,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,"was the storm last night, Gary? >> The storm was terrible."
623,00:36:24.25,00:36:24.25,It was definitely a character- building night.
624,00:36:26.46,00:36:26.46,"Two of us slept through the whole thing, so they got some"
625,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"sleep, but everybody else was out at the fire trying to keep"
626,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,the fire going. >> PROBST: Who slept?
627,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,">> Brian and Blake. >> In my defense, I woke up and"
628,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,"took the late shift. >> I just figured, they're"
629,00:36:39.46,00:36:39.46,"standing by the fire, trying to stay warm."
630,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,"They're just cold, wet and miserable."
631,00:36:42.96,00:36:42.96,"I was like, I'm getting lucky in here."
632,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,I'm ridin' the rain out. I thought everybody would come
633,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,back in and join me. I didn't think it would be an
634,00:36:47.75,00:36:47.75,entire night out there. >> Golden boy.
635,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,>> PROBST: Is that your nickname?
636,00:36:52.96,00:36:52.96,>> She did give me a nickname. >> PROBST: Golden Boy?
637,00:36:55.12,00:36:55.12,">> Golden Boy, no matter what, comes out shining."
638,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,He's the Golden Boy with the golden flag-- ah!-- and that
639,00:37:02.79,00:37:02.79,"sparkle in his tooth. >> PROBST: Blake, you're a guy"
640,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,that was gasping for air. You had your arms on your chest
641,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,going... and now you're Golden  Boy?
642,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,">> I crashed and now, you know, I have perked up."
643,00:37:14.17,00:37:14.17,I've got my wind back in my sails.
644,00:37:16.42,00:37:16.42,I just think it was something my body had to go through.
645,00:37:18.88,00:37:18.88,"Luckily, I'm feeling better and now I think I'm ready to ride"
646,00:37:22.29,00:37:22.29,"out to the end. >> PROBST: Brandon, day 14."
647,00:37:26.04,00:37:26.04,The social aspect of this game is starting to pick up.
648,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,It's a lot more than just physical challenges.
649,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,Are you seeing that increase? >> Yeah.
650,00:37:33.96,00:37:33.96,I'd say it is starting to ramp up a little.
651,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,"I mean, getting to know these people a little bit more."
652,00:37:39.67,00:37:39.67,You start to like people a little bit more than others.
653,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,">> PROBST: Gary, two tribes merged."
654,00:37:46.38,00:37:46.38,"There's four former Nakum, three former Yaxha."
655,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,What were those first few moments like and how are they
656,00:37:52.04,00:37:52.04,different now? >> The first few moments were
657,00:37:54.12,00:37:54.12,pretty scary because you don't know where you stand.
658,00:37:56.88,00:37:56.88,The numbers are against you. And trying to get to know
659,00:38:00.54,00:38:00.54,everybody was just like they won over again.
660,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,">> PROBST: Amy, do you feel like this is two groups of people"
661,00:38:06.29,00:38:06.29,"living together? >> Well, I'm thinking we're one"
662,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,group and forget what happened before.
663,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,This is my tribe and this is who I'm loyal to.
664,00:38:14.29,00:38:14.29,"Obviously we're at a disadvantage, but you just try"
665,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,"to do the best you can. >> PROBST: Blake, is that the"
666,00:38:20.04,00:38:20.04,same for you? Are you guys one tribe and to
667,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,heck with what happened before this?
668,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,">> We've all come together as seven in the last few days,"
669,00:38:25.88,00:38:25.88,"but, yeah, I mean, there's definitely bonds that I've"
670,00:38:28.17,00:38:28.17,formed with Danni and Bobby and Brandon that I haven't
671,00:38:30.71,00:38:30.71,gotten to experience with these guys.
672,00:38:32.29,00:38:32.29,That'll certainly influence me to some extent.
673,00:38:34.42,00:38:34.42,">> PROBST: Brian, what do you guys have to do to encourage"
674,00:38:37.50,00:38:37.50,this group to think as a group and not down tribal lines?
675,00:38:40.62,00:38:40.62,">> If that's their game plan, just to pick us off, I'm sorry"
676,00:38:43.54,00:38:43.54,"that it is, because we're good people and we should take the"
677,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,time to get to know one another before you make such a snap
678,00:38:48.67,00:38:48.67,"judgment. So, if it's me tonight, I'm"
679,00:38:51.12,00:38:51.12,afraid I'm a victim of a minority.
680,00:38:53.42,00:38:53.42,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, tonight's vote tough, easy, indifferent?"
681,00:38:58.04,00:38:58.04,>> Every Tribal Council is a tough vote for me.
682,00:39:00.54,00:39:00.54,"Everybody in their own way fought to get here, and"
683,00:39:03.21,00:39:03.21,somebody's about to go home tonight.
684,00:39:05.46,00:39:05.46,"Their journey is about to end. So, you know, I don't like"
685,00:39:08.04,00:39:08.04,ending somebody's dream. I like to keep the dream alive.
686,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,>> PROBST: Okay. It is time to vote.
687,00:39:13.83,00:39:13.83,"Bobby Jon, you're up. >> You may be the Golden Boy,"
688,00:39:29.79,00:39:29.79,but I'm platinum. I hope it's you.
689,00:39:52.33,00:39:52.33,">> You know, I think of the three people on the original"
690,00:39:55.04,00:39:55.04,"Yaxha team, you're the weakest right now."
691,00:40:09.67,00:40:09.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
692,00:40:18.62,00:40:18.62,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
693,00:40:21.12,00:40:21.12,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
694,00:40:23.88,00:40:23.88,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
695,00:40:27.29,00:40:27.29,First vote... Blake.
696,00:40:34.08,00:40:34.08,"Brian. One vote Blake, one vote Brian."
697,00:40:39.67,00:40:39.67,"Brian. Two votes Brian, one vote Blake."
698,00:40:46.08,00:40:46.08,"Blake. Two votes Blake, two votes"
699,00:40:49.21,00:40:49.21,Brian. Blake.
700,00:40:53.71,00:40:53.71,"Three votes Blake, two votes Brian."
701,00:41:01.00,00:41:01.00,"The fifth person voted out of Survivor: Guatemala, Blake."
702,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,"That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
703,00:41:14.42,00:41:14.42,"Blake, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
704,00:41:19.50,00:41:19.50,">> Bye, guys. >> PROBST: Well, I'd say based"
705,00:41:30.54,00:41:30.54,"on tonight's vote, this game just took a big shift."
706,00:41:34.17,00:41:34.17,Grab your torches and head back to camp.

720,00:42:22.21,00:42:22.21,"and I'm kind of angry. You know, I've stepped it up in"
721,00:42:24.04,00:42:24.04,"a few challenges, and I think that they were just trying"
722,00:42:26.46,00:42:26.46,to get out somebody strong. Why would you do that?
723,00:42:28.12,00:42:28.12,"That makes no sense. But, you know, you don't want"
724,00:42:30.00,00:42:30.00,"all the strong players, I guess, but again, playing the odds, I"
725,00:42:31.21,00:42:31.21,don't understand why it happened.
