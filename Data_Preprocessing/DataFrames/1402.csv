105,00:07:17.50,00:07:17.50,Rubbing sticks is great if youhave 30 people who are all
106,00:07:20.25,00:07:20.25,hydrated and have energy.When you have eight people who
107,00:07:24.08,00:07:24.08,"are tired as hell and who haveno water in their system, it"
108,00:07:28.46,00:07:28.46,burns you out pretty fast.>> So since we did not get any

114,00:08:00.04,00:08:00.04,more energy.>> I think I can get one open in
115,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,"one minute.What's that, 30 seconds?"
116,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,">> Ooh!A little cocky, are we, buddy?"
117,00:08:16.62,00:08:16.62,I didn't know we had acompetition.

127,00:08:55.92,00:08:55.92,"for more than, like, an hour anda half, I'm telling you."
128,00:08:59.67,00:08:59.67,"I just... you know, I've neverexperienced dehydration like"

132,00:09:13.21,00:09:13.21,"I don't do that!I eat clams, too."
133,00:09:16.79,00:09:16.79,I don't eat them off the ground.Huh?
134,00:09:19.42,00:09:19.42,No!It's crazy!

137,00:09:36.12,00:09:36.12,water into that.>> Boo caught something in his
138,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,"eye, and his eye's red.He's got an obvious indentation"
139,00:09:43.58,00:09:43.58,in his eye.Just blink with your eye as I'm
140,00:09:45.92,00:09:45.92,pouring it in.Try to go as long as you can.
141,00:09:48.08,00:09:48.08,"Just blink.Just keep it, keep it."
142,00:09:52.17,00:09:52.17,It's going to be bad.It's going to be annoying.
143,00:09:54.75,00:09:54.75,Just keep it.All right.
144,00:10:05.21,00:10:05.21,>> Look how he dropped that axso close to his leg.

148,00:10:24.67,00:10:24.67,>> I just barely finishedhelping him with the eye
149,00:10:27.04,00:10:27.04,"situation, and the next thingyou know, he takes an ax, and"
150,00:10:29.58,00:10:29.58,literally the ax went throughthe finger and right down to the
151,00:10:33.21,00:10:33.21,knee.>> Quit worrying about my
152,00:10:35.71,00:10:35.71,injury.>> We aren't worrying about your
153,00:10:37.71,00:10:37.71,injury.>> We have other stuff we need
154,00:10:39.33,00:10:39.33,to do.>> Like what?

158,00:10:49.25,00:10:49.25,don't have to vote nobody outsooner or later.
159,00:10:51.58,00:10:51.58,"For real, he has one leg, onehand, and one eye."
160,00:10:57.25,00:10:57.25,He really ain't no good to usnow.
161,00:10:59.21,00:10:59.21,What can we do?We've got to think about that
162,00:11:01.17,00:11:01.17,kind of stuff.That's the kind of stuff I'll be
163,00:11:02.92,00:11:02.92,"thinking about, you know whatI'm saying?"
164,00:11:04.62,00:11:04.62,Everybody knows it.Everybody is predicting it.
165,00:11:06.25,00:11:06.25,Boo will hurt himself out of thegame.
166,00:11:11.67,00:11:11.67,">> Darn it, Boo!>> Oh, my god."

171,00:11:46.75,00:11:46.75,>> Ravu.>> Ravu!
172,00:11:48.88,00:11:48.88,I knew it was going to be good.Did you guys make a home?
173,00:11:52.54,00:11:52.54,>> Huh?>> Did you make a home or are

178,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,"When Sylvia came back from ExileIsland, everybody was excited."
179,00:12:12.75,00:12:12.75,"But when I went up to greet her,I had only one thing in my mind,"
180,00:12:15.71,00:12:15.71,and that was to see if she foundthe immunity idol.
181,00:12:19.08,00:12:19.08,So when I was giving her a hug Iwas actually quite nasty.
182,00:12:22.08,00:12:22.08,I looked over her shoulder andopened up her shoulder bag and
183,00:12:25.33,00:12:25.33,"did a little quick search, and Ididn't find anything."
184,00:12:28.42,00:12:28.42,">> Oh, my god!>> That was my first thought in"
185,00:12:31.21,00:12:31.21,"mind-- ""When I'm hugging her,I'm going to feel her up and see"
186,00:12:33.88,00:12:33.88,"if the idol is there."">> I made fire for the first"
187,00:12:37.17,00:12:37.17,time in my life.There's no flint here?
188,00:12:42.58,00:12:42.58,">> No, we had no fire here.>> We've got nothing."

201,00:13:21.92,00:13:21.92,I feel like at this point I'm abit extraneous.
202,00:13:26.12,00:13:26.12,"I'm a bit like... because Imissed the whole day with them,"

208,00:13:44.54,00:13:44.54,It looks like your left handcould use a little support.
209,00:13:46.58,00:13:46.58,Could you?Um...
210,00:13:49.12,00:13:49.12,>> Michelle.>> Yeah.
211,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,>> I was not really excited forSylvia to come back.
212,00:13:55.33,00:13:55.33,I already didn't have greatfeelings about her personality.
213,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,"I personally think she's alittle bossy, and just likes to"
214,00:14:01.17,00:14:01.17,push people around.>> How about fishing along the
215,00:14:03.54,00:14:03.54,shore?>> We can try it.

217,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,"some oysters.>> In many ways, Sylvia's the"
218,00:14:14.12,00:14:14.12,outsider.She kind of does rub people the
219,00:14:16.71,00:14:16.71,"wrong way.I mean, it's not so much that"
220,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,she's a bad person.It's just that she's... for lack
221,00:14:22.54,00:14:22.54,"of a better word, she's bossy.>> Yep."
222,00:15:04.88,00:15:04.88,"If I throw the machete, are yougoing to catch it?"
223,00:15:11.29,00:15:11.29,>> There you go.>> Being on Survivor is pretty
224,00:15:14.50,00:15:14.50,much a little bit easier thanbeing homeless.
225,00:15:17.25,00:15:17.25,"Hey, watch out!Look, I'm going to bring down a"
226,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,"family of them.>> Oh, that was a good one,"
227,00:15:23.00,00:15:23.00,buddy.You got six out of that.
228,00:15:25.96,00:15:25.96,">> When I was first homeless, Iwas about seven years old"
229,00:15:29.83,00:15:29.83,because my momma started doingdrugs.
230,00:15:32.46,00:15:32.46,>> I wouldn't step on that onefor too much security.
231,00:15:35.00,00:15:35.00,>> Our momma was a crackhead.And my brothers and sisters and
232,00:15:37.42,00:15:37.42,I decided all we got is eachother and ourselves.
233,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,And so we used to just get thefood out of the trash can that
234,00:15:42.83,00:15:42.83,"people throw away.It's very similar, having to go"
235,00:15:46.62,00:15:46.62,"out and get food, having to findfood."
236,00:15:49.46,00:15:49.46,And when you find food you ain'tgoing to be greedy and eat it
237,00:15:52.21,00:15:52.21,"yourself because you're hungry,because you know everybody else"
238,00:15:55.04,00:15:55.04,"is hungry, too.>> That's beautiful."
239,00:15:58.04,00:15:58.04,"That's a beautiful thing.>> There's so much more, there"
240,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,"are so many more.The more trees we find, the more"
241,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,we run wild.I know my teammates don't know
242,00:16:07.38,00:16:07.38,"what it's like to suffer.When I first got here, I was"
243,00:16:10.25,00:16:10.25,"like, ""What are these peopledoing here?"""
244,00:16:12.38,00:16:12.38,I don't think they know whatit's like to struggle.
245,00:16:14.54,00:16:14.54,I think this is the moststruggle some people had that's
246,00:16:17.46,00:16:17.46,"here, which is not really even astruggle to me."
247,00:16:19.88,00:16:19.88,This is easier than beinghomeless on the street.
248,00:16:22.21,00:16:22.21,I know people are going to bejealous.
249,00:16:24.46,00:16:24.46,"People sitting at home, they'regoing to be jealous, because"
250,00:16:26.71,00:16:26.71,we've got more food here thanthey have in their refrigerator.
251,00:16:29.12,00:16:29.12,">> Oh, wow.That would be sad."

253,00:16:33.79,00:16:33.79,>> This is more food that I'vegot in my refrigerator.
254,00:16:36.29,00:16:36.29,>> I have a weight ofresponsibility to last in this
255,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,"game, because I do want to helpmy family."
256,00:16:40.54,00:16:40.54,I'm in an amazing spot in mylife right now.
257,00:16:45.04,00:16:45.04,I'm going to help my family whenI get back.
258,00:17:02.62,00:17:02.62,>> Ahoy!I am beyond starving.
259,00:17:07.88,00:17:07.88,"I'm looking for anything, anytree of life, anything."
260,00:17:13.83,00:17:13.83,">> Look on the ground, man.>> Hey, this is something."

265,00:17:48.46,00:17:48.46,"We went all the way up to thetop, around, nothing."
266,00:17:51.79,00:17:51.79,I went all the way up that way.There's no other fruit here.
267,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,"Nothing.>> Oh, my god."
268,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,Pineapples.There are so many of them.

563,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,"It goes like this!""Can that be an interference?"
564,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,">> A lot of people tried a lotof different pieces, and I was"
565,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"really trying to help out, givesome input."
566,00:36:38.21,00:36:38.21,I'm passionate about my team.I'm passionate about winning.
567,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"And I feel like putting my inputin wasn't such a bad thing, and"
568,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,all I asked them to do was to goback and try it again.
569,00:36:46.79,00:36:46.79,">> PROBST: Sylvia, you dividethese tribes, then you leave."
570,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,You come back.Did you feel welcomed?
571,00:36:54.62,00:36:54.62,">> Actually, I felt kind of likean outsider."
572,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,"They had the challenge itself,and then going back to camp,"
573,00:37:02.08,00:37:02.08,"putting it together, and thenhaving to come here, and that's"
574,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"a lot of bonding.So by the time I showed up, I"
575,00:37:08.58,00:37:08.58,"felt I was on the outside.>> PROBST: Rocky, what was your"
576,00:37:12.92,00:37:12.92,reaction to Sylvia coming backand joining the tribe?
577,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,">> Sylvia is used to leading.She's used to, you know,"
578,00:37:18.83,00:37:18.83,dictating and telling peoplewhat to do.
579,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,"But whatever she tries to putacross, she's doing it in a"
580,00:37:23.25,00:37:23.25,"positive way.>> PROBST: Anthony, is what"
581,00:37:25.88,00:37:25.88,Rocky said true?Is Sylvia more of a leader?
582,00:37:28.96,00:37:28.96,">> Bless you, Sylvia.You have a wonderful habit of"
583,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,"kind of throwing out an idea andsaying, ""Let's do it,"" and not"
584,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,actually talking with anybodyabout doing it.
585,00:37:37.25,00:37:37.25,">> PROBST: So, again, Sylvia,people are saying you're"
586,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,somewhat of a leader.Is this surprising to you?
587,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,">> A little, because I came inlate."
588,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,So I could not be the leaderjust walking in off Exile Island
589,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"and say, ""Okay, everybody, clearthe way."
590,00:37:50.29,00:37:50.29,"I'm leader.""But I can offer ideas."
591,00:37:52.96,00:37:52.96,"An idea that's been gurgling inmy head, which I haven't brought"
592,00:37:55.71,00:37:55.71,"up to everybody, but tomorrowwhen we're fresh, when we wake"
593,00:37:59.71,00:37:59.71,"up, is to assign a leader.>> PROBST: So Yau-Man, last"
594,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,"tribal council it was ""Let's getrid of the weakest member, make"
595,00:38:06.04,00:38:06.04,"our tribe stronger.""What's the criteria this time"
596,00:38:09.04,00:38:09.04,for voting somebody out?>> The criteria this time I
597,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,"think is to have a more cohesivetribe, to form a tribe where we"
598,00:38:19.79,00:38:19.79,get along better and be open todiscussion and get rid of
599,00:38:22.71,00:38:22.71,"someone who is too vocal or toostubborn, who is too arrogant"
600,00:38:26.25,00:38:26.25,"about things.>> PROBST: Okay, before we get"
601,00:38:29.96,00:38:29.96,"to the vote, here are the rulesabout the hidden immunity idol."
602,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,It is good through the finalfive.
603,00:38:35.54,00:38:35.54,"If you decide to play it, youwill do so after the votes have"
604,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,"been cast, but before I readthem."
605,00:38:41.38,00:38:41.38,You can also give it to someoneelse at that point.
606,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,If the person who uses the idoldoes in fact have the highest
607,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,"number of votes, then the personwith the next highest number of"
608,00:38:50.12,00:38:50.12,"votes would be sent home.Okay, it is time to vote."
609,00:38:54.42,00:38:54.42,"Erica, you're up.>> I just can't read you"
610,00:39:10.75,00:39:10.75,anymore.And quite frankly you're the
611,00:39:12.71,00:39:12.71,"biggest threat right now.Sorry, baby."
612,00:39:26.04,00:39:26.04,>> I'm voting for you becauseyou've been a little bit pushy
613,00:39:29.25,00:39:29.25,for me.I'm sorry.
614,00:39:44.04,00:39:44.04,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
615,00:39:57.33,00:39:57.33,">> PROBST: If anyone has theidol and wants to play it, now"
616,00:39:59.54,00:39:59.54,is the time to do so.Okay.
617,00:40:05.17,00:40:05.17,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
618,00:40:07.38,00:40:07.38,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
619,00:40:09.42,00:40:09.42,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
620,00:40:12.75,00:40:12.75,"First vote, Erica.Sylvia."
621,00:40:23.75,00:40:23.75,"Erica.Two vote Erica, one vote Sylvia."

625,00:40:46.33,00:40:46.33,"Four votes Erica, two votesSylvia."
626,00:40:52.29,00:40:52.29,Second person voted out ofSurvivor: Fiji.
627,00:41:07.12,00:41:07.12,"Erica, the tribe has spoken.It's time for you to go."
628,00:41:23.00,00:41:23.00,Not much to say.This tribe has to find a way to
629,00:41:26.12,00:41:26.12,"win.Once again, you will be going"
630,00:41:28.92,00:41:28.92,back to camp without fire.Grab your stuff.
631,00:41:32.17,00:41:32.17,Head on out.Good night.
632,00:41:47.79,00:41:47.79,>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.
633,00:41:53.50,00:41:53.50,>> PROBST: Next timeon Survivor:
634,00:41:56.92,00:41:56.92,Sylvia digs for immunity.>> I'm pretty sure I know where
635,00:41:58.79,00:41:58.79,the idol is.>> Whoa!
636,00:42:01.08,00:42:01.08,>> PROBST: Ravu sparks a flame.>> We're not going to die!
637,00:42:03.58,00:42:03.58,>> We finally got the shot inthe ass we needed.
638,00:42:05.79,00:42:05.79,>> PROBST: And a Moto member isin trouble.
639,00:42:08.71,00:42:08.71,>> He can't breathe.He was afraid.
640,00:42:10.58,00:42:10.58,He said he didn't want to die inFiji.
641,00:42:18.12,00:42:18.12,">> I was very, very shocked bythe vote tonight."
642,00:42:20.88,00:42:20.88,It kind of hurts to getblindsided like that.
643,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,I don't think it was a smartmove to vote off somebody who
644,00:42:25.92,00:42:25.92,was strong.When the next challenge comes
645,00:42:28.00,00:42:28.00,"around, I hope you guys win, butif you don't, I want you to"
646,00:42:30.17,00:42:30.17,think about voting me off andthink about who you kept.
647,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,And if you go home empty-handedmaybe you should think about the
648,00:42:35.17,00:42:35.17,decision that you made.
