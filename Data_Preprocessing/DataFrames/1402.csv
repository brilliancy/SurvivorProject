2,00:00:02.42,00:00:02.42,Survivor: On a remote island off the coast
3,00:00:05.17,00:00:05.17,"of Fiji, 19 Americans were marooned with no instructions."
4,00:00:10.38,00:00:10.38,">> We don't have a pot, we don't have water, we don't have"
5,00:00:12.04,00:00:12.04,"anything, and none of us have a clue what's going on."
6,00:00:14.42,00:00:14.42,">> Come on, we've got visitors! >> PROBST: Then a message from"
7,00:00:16.88,00:00:16.88,above quickly changed everything.
8,00:00:19.17,00:00:19.17,">> ""Welcome, survivors. Construct the best possible"
9,00:00:21.17,00:00:21.17,"living area you can."" >> Holy cow, man!"
10,00:00:23.46,00:00:23.46,>> All right! >> PROBST: With an unprecedented
11,00:00:25.38,00:00:25.38,abundance of supplies... >> Let's rock and roll.
12,00:00:27.42,00:00:27.42,>> PROBST: ...the castaways begin to build the most
13,00:00:29.50,00:00:29.50,elaborate camp in Survivor history.
14,00:00:32.04,00:00:32.04,>> The kitchen's going to be right there.
15,00:00:33.96,00:00:33.96,>> PROBST: Sylvia the architect spearheaded the construction
16,00:00:35.75,00:00:35.75,"effort. >> Hey, I notice nobody's"
17,00:00:37.38,00:00:37.38,working on the kitchen. We need a crew for the kitchen
18,00:00:39.33,00:00:39.33,or else it won't be done until tomorrow.
19,00:00:41.92,00:00:41.92,>> I do get the sense that Sylvia's trying to dominate.
20,00:00:43.88,00:00:43.88,You're going to upset the wagon by doing that.
21,00:00:46.25,00:00:46.25,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Sylvia's leadership"
22,00:00:48.92,00:00:48.92,earned her the right to divide the tribes.
23,00:00:51.58,00:00:51.58,"Moto, you are green. Ravu, you are orange."
24,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,">> Yeah, baby! >> PROBST: Then Sylvia learned"
25,00:00:58.33,00:00:58.33,"she had immunity, but would be banished to Exile Island."
26,00:01:01.29,00:01:01.29,You will rejoin this game by joining the tribe that does lose
27,00:01:05.25,00:01:05.25,a member. Exile Island awaits.
28,00:01:07.79,00:01:07.79,The stage was set for a high- stakes challenge.
29,00:01:11.38,00:01:11.38,"In addition to immunity, the winning tribe gets to stay on"
30,00:01:14.62,00:01:14.62,"the beach that all 19 of you put blood, sweat, and tears into"
31,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,building. Losers will go to a new beach
32,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,"where you will find one pot and one machete, and that's it."
33,00:01:29.04,00:01:29.04,Go! During the challenge...
34,00:01:31.12,00:01:31.12,Jessica still working on the pieces.
35,00:01:33.38,00:01:33.38,...Jessica slowed Ravu down. Moto has their knife!
36,00:01:35.96,00:01:35.96,And Moto came out ahead. Moto wins immunity and reward!
37,00:01:39.58,00:01:39.58,"Ravu, here's a map to your new beach."
38,00:01:42.92,00:01:42.92,Not much waiting for you. On Exile Island...
39,00:01:46.17,00:01:46.17,">> ""Here you won't find the idol you crave."""
40,00:01:48.46,00:01:48.46,>> PROBST: Sylvia discovered that the hidden idol was back at
41,00:01:50.96,00:01:50.96,her tribe camp. >> Now I have to figure out a
42,00:01:53.71,00:01:53.71,time when I can search for it without prying eyes.
43,00:01:57.25,00:01:57.25,>> We're home! >> PROBST: And Ravu landed on a
44,00:02:00.17,00:02:00.17,new beach. >> We've got a double whammy.
45,00:02:02.17,00:02:02.17,"We have to start over, a new shelter, but now we've got to"
46,00:02:04.33,00:02:04.33,figure out a team member to lose.
47,00:02:06.83,00:02:06.83,>> PROBST: And at tribal council...
48,00:02:09.71,00:02:09.71,"First person voted out of Survivor: Fiji, Jessica."
49,00:02:13.00,00:02:13.00,...the tribe singled out Jessica as the weak link.
50,00:02:15.00,00:02:15.00,"Jessica, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left."
51,00:02:20.88,00:02:20.88,Who will be voted out tonight? >> The leaves have water on
52,00:02:37.75,00:02:37.75,them. Water!
53,00:02:43.79,00:02:43.79,>> Tree licking good. >> This is the weirdest thing
54,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,I've ever done. But it's good.
55,00:02:49.96,00:02:49.96,I think I'm going to grab a couple of more.
56,00:02:51.88,00:02:51.88,>> It's like tree hugging. >> Let's go.
57,00:02:53.83,00:02:53.83,">> So it's day four on the island, and we're dehydrated."
58,00:02:58.21,00:02:58.21,We're so desperate for water that we found that there's
59,00:03:01.75,00:03:01.75,"trickle bits of water on leaves, and so just licking the leaves"
60,00:03:05.25,00:03:05.25,"and getting as much water as possible, we thought that would"
61,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,"be a good idea. >> Oh, no!"
62,00:03:10.79,00:03:10.79,">> Seriously, just lick some leaves, man."
63,00:03:13.12,00:03:13.12,The palms are better. >> I've never... have you ever
64,00:03:16.21,00:03:16.21,licked a leaf before? >> We need to survive.
65,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17,It's hard to even think when you're dying of starvation and
66,00:03:24.12,00:03:24.12,thirst. Thirst before anything.
67,00:03:32.08,00:03:32.08,>> You missed one. >> It's just a little bit of
68,00:03:34.38,00:03:34.38,dirt. >> We're all just dehydrated.
69,00:03:40.04,00:03:40.04,It makes you delirious. >> Lick it.
70,00:03:44.08,00:03:44.08,>> So good. >> How did you guys sleep?
71,00:05:16.92,00:05:16.92,>> I slept really well last night.
72,00:05:18.71,00:05:18.71,The pillows really make a difference.
73,00:05:20.33,00:05:20.33,It's ridiculous. >> We are very fortunate to be
74,00:05:22.58,00:05:22.58,living the way that we're living.
75,00:05:24.42,00:05:24.42,Yesterday we did win one hell of a reward.
76,00:05:27.79,00:05:27.79,( scat singing ) \xe2\x99\xaa We are in an island. \xe2\x99\xaa
77,00:05:32.12,00:05:32.12,( scat singing ) ( laughter )
78,00:05:35.12,00:05:35.12,">> We do have a really plush couch, beautiful pillows that we"
79,00:05:38.04,00:05:38.04,could sleep on. There's two hammocks.
80,00:05:41.25,00:05:41.25,"You know, we have silverware, plates."
81,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,We're all more than happy. We're all sitting around
82,00:05:47.50,00:05:47.50,"thinking the same thing-- this game is so vicious, it's"
83,00:05:50.08,00:05:50.08,delicious. I just killed an ant with a
84,00:05:54.21,00:05:54.21,hammer. ( laughing )
85,00:05:57.08,00:05:57.08,"What a great death. >> Yeah, man."
86,00:06:00.38,00:06:00.38,"It's rough out here. Belly full of salted rice, fresh"
87,00:06:07.08,00:06:07.08,"mangoes, lemonade. >> There's some more rice in"
88,00:06:11.04,00:06:11.04,"here. >> Of course, we made it"
89,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,ourselves. The fat of the land.
90,00:06:23.71,00:06:23.71,"( farting sound ) >> Oh, my god!"
91,00:06:26.92,00:06:26.92,"Boo! Oh, for the love of Pete."
92,00:06:29.33,00:06:29.33,>> That's air. It's not like a sea urchin.
93,00:06:32.00,00:06:32.00,>> Still! >> We're already full.
94,00:06:34.58,00:06:34.58,"You know, this is going to be the first Survivor where you"
95,00:06:37.42,00:06:37.42,actually gain weight when you come.
96,00:06:44.92,00:06:44.92,>> We have a lot to do over there.
97,00:06:46.88,00:06:46.88,"A nice, long, groove. See, that's what we need."
98,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,>> Come on! >> It's tiring.
99,00:06:56.00,00:06:56.00,It's very tiring. >> It is.
100,00:06:57.83,00:06:57.83,>> It's going to take a long time to do.
101,00:06:59.54,00:06:59.54,"Do you want to take a break? >> Go, go, go, go, go."
102,00:07:03.21,00:07:03.21,">> Right now, Ravu is in pretty bad shape."
103,00:07:08.88,00:07:08.88,"We've got heart for days, but heart doesn't do any good when"
104,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,you're as thirsty and hungry as we are.
105,00:07:14.67,00:07:14.67,We rub sticks and we rub more sticks.
106,00:07:17.50,00:07:17.50,Rubbing sticks is great if you have 30 people who are all
107,00:07:20.25,00:07:20.25,hydrated and have energy. When you have eight people who
108,00:07:24.08,00:07:24.08,"are tired as hell and who have no water in their system, it"
109,00:07:28.46,00:07:28.46,burns you out pretty fast. >> So since we did not get any
110,00:07:43.38,00:07:43.38,"fire yet and weren't able to boil water, the plan here is to"
111,00:07:47.17,00:07:47.17,fill up as many canisters as we can with coconut water.
112,00:07:51.42,00:07:51.42,"With a good knife, it takes about a minute to crack open a"
113,00:07:55.79,00:07:55.79,"coconut. With a bad knife it takes, like,"
114,00:07:57.96,00:07:57.96,"three, four, minutes. I mean, that really takes a lot"
115,00:08:00.04,00:08:00.04,more energy. >> I think I can get one open in
116,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,"one minute. What's that, 30 seconds?"
117,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,">> Ooh! A little cocky, are we, buddy?"
118,00:08:16.62,00:08:16.62,I didn't know we had a competition.
119,00:08:18.38,00:08:18.38,">> Let's get the stopwatch out. >> Trying to take your title,"
120,00:08:20.46,00:08:20.46,there. >> They are completely full.
121,00:08:29.92,00:08:29.92,>> Are you kidding me? Nothing!
122,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,">> Today, what's going on is basically everyone's beat."
123,00:08:38.08,00:08:38.08,Nobody really has the energy to chop anything open or run
124,00:08:40.62,00:08:40.62,"around, so you, like, chop up five coconuts, take a nap for an"
125,00:08:43.50,00:08:43.50,"hour. I'm telling you, right now,"
126,00:08:50.46,00:08:50.46,nobody has a clue. We're walking around into the
127,00:08:52.71,00:08:52.71,"rocks and the trees, guy. Half of us can't even stand up"
128,00:08:55.92,00:08:55.92,"for more than, like, an hour and a half, I'm telling you."
129,00:08:59.67,00:08:59.67,"I just... you know, I've never experienced dehydration like"
130,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,"this so much. You guys want this, or what?"
131,00:09:07.04,00:09:07.04,">> Rocky, just swallow it. >> Yeah?"
132,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67,I was eating clams off the ground.
133,00:09:13.21,00:09:13.21,"I don't do that! I eat clams, too."
134,00:09:16.79,00:09:16.79,I don't eat them off the ground. Huh?
135,00:09:19.42,00:09:19.42,No! It's crazy!
136,00:09:21.38,00:09:21.38,"We're starving here, bro! >> On the stick?"
137,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,">> On the sign. >> Man, you'd better get some"
138,00:09:36.12,00:09:36.12,water into that. >> Boo caught something in his
139,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,"eye, and his eye's red. He's got an obvious indentation"
140,00:09:43.58,00:09:43.58,in his eye. Just blink with your eye as I'm
141,00:09:45.92,00:09:45.92,pouring it in. Try to go as long as you can.
142,00:09:48.08,00:09:48.08,"Just blink. Just keep it, keep it."
143,00:09:52.17,00:09:52.17,It's going to be bad. It's going to be annoying.
144,00:09:54.75,00:09:54.75,Just keep it. All right.
145,00:10:05.21,00:10:05.21,>> Look how he dropped that ax so close to his leg.
146,00:10:10.17,00:10:10.17,">> Oh, my god, Boo, be careful. >> Oops."
147,00:10:16.58,00:10:16.58,">> Oh, my god. >> Oh, my god, Boo, how did it"
148,00:10:21.67,00:10:21.67,happen? >> Hang on.
149,00:10:24.67,00:10:24.67,>> I just barely finished helping him with the eye
150,00:10:27.04,00:10:27.04,"situation, and the next thing you know, he takes an ax, and"
151,00:10:29.58,00:10:29.58,literally the ax went through the finger and right down to the
152,00:10:33.21,00:10:33.21,knee. >> Quit worrying about my
153,00:10:35.71,00:10:35.71,injury. >> We aren't worrying about your
154,00:10:37.71,00:10:37.71,injury. >> We have other stuff we need
155,00:10:39.33,00:10:39.33,to do. >> Like what?
156,00:10:41.04,00:10:41.04,>> I will tell y'all when I think I need some help.
157,00:10:43.04,00:10:43.04,">> It's too late then, Boo. Boo is very stubborn."
158,00:10:45.58,00:10:45.58,He's a real hazard to himself. I can see it happening where we
159,00:10:49.25,00:10:49.25,don't have to vote nobody out sooner or later.
160,00:10:51.58,00:10:51.58,"For real, he has one leg, one hand, and one eye."
161,00:10:57.25,00:10:57.25,He really ain't no good to us now.
162,00:10:59.21,00:10:59.21,What can we do? We've got to think about that
163,00:11:01.17,00:11:01.17,kind of stuff. That's the kind of stuff I'll be
164,00:11:02.92,00:11:02.92,"thinking about, you know what I'm saying?"
165,00:11:04.62,00:11:04.62,Everybody knows it. Everybody is predicting it.
166,00:11:06.25,00:11:06.25,Boo will hurt himself out of the game.
167,00:11:11.67,00:11:11.67,">> Darn it, Boo! >> Oh, my god."
168,00:11:14.96,00:11:14.96,>> Had to happen to me. >> Sylvia.
169,00:11:33.25,00:11:33.25,>> Is she here? >> Yeah.
170,00:11:36.92,00:11:36.92,"Yeah, there she is. Come on, you guys."
171,00:11:41.96,00:11:41.96,">> Hey, Anthony! What are you guys called again?"
172,00:11:46.75,00:11:46.75,>> Ravu. >> Ravu!
173,00:11:48.88,00:11:48.88,I knew it was going to be good. Did you guys make a home?
174,00:11:52.54,00:11:52.54,>> Huh? >> Did you make a home or are
175,00:11:55.75,00:11:55.75,you waiting for me? >> We waited for you.
176,00:11:57.62,00:11:57.62,">> Oh, my god. >> Oh, my god, it was horrible."
177,00:12:02.12,00:12:02.12,Hi! I was... I was hoping... I was
178,00:12:05.04,00:12:05.04,hoping I would be on your team. >> Welcome home!
179,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,"When Sylvia came back from Exile Island, everybody was excited."
180,00:12:12.75,00:12:12.75,"But when I went up to greet her, I had only one thing in my mind,"
181,00:12:15.71,00:12:15.71,and that was to see if she found the immunity idol.
182,00:12:19.08,00:12:19.08,So when I was giving her a hug I was actually quite nasty.
183,00:12:22.08,00:12:22.08,I looked over her shoulder and opened up her shoulder bag and
184,00:12:25.33,00:12:25.33,"did a little quick search, and I didn't find anything."
185,00:12:28.42,00:12:28.42,">> Oh, my god! >> That was my first thought in"
186,00:12:31.21,00:12:31.21,"mind-- ""When I'm hugging her, I'm going to feel her up and see"
187,00:12:33.88,00:12:33.88,"if the idol is there."" >> I made fire for the first"
188,00:12:37.17,00:12:37.17,time in my life. There's no flint here?
189,00:12:42.58,00:12:42.58,">> No, we had no fire here. >> We've got nothing."
190,00:12:45.25,00:12:45.25,>> We don't have water. >> So when I got here and they
191,00:12:47.33,00:12:47.33,"told me they had no fire and no water at all, you know, you're"
192,00:12:52.92,00:12:52.92,"just kind of like, ""We're stuck in a really bad situation."""
193,00:12:57.12,00:12:57.12,So how many canteens do we have filled yet?
194,00:12:59.42,00:12:59.42,>> None. >> We're just starting the
195,00:13:01.08,00:13:01.08,process. Okay.
196,00:13:03.08,00:13:03.08,Isn't that awesome? >> Here.
197,00:13:07.04,00:13:07.04,"I'll try it, Erica. Okay, so..."
198,00:13:09.08,00:13:09.08,>> You need to give it a good whack.
199,00:13:11.75,00:13:11.75,"Here, over the... so you drip... >> Hey, it ain't working for me,"
200,00:13:16.21,00:13:16.21,guys. >> Harder.
201,00:13:18.08,00:13:18.08,Just hit hard. >> I am!
202,00:13:21.92,00:13:21.92,I feel like at this point I'm a bit extraneous.
203,00:13:26.12,00:13:26.12,"I'm a bit like... because I missed the whole day with them,"
204,00:13:29.92,00:13:29.92,"and they've got the whole rhythm going, so I feel like I'm coming"
205,00:13:32.29,00:13:32.29,"in and trying to help, but I'm not..."
206,00:13:35.17,00:13:35.17,">> Oh, man. >> ... you know, part of the"
207,00:13:38.08,00:13:38.08,core right now. If the sun gets intense for long
208,00:13:40.75,00:13:40.75,"enough, you might get something there."
209,00:13:44.54,00:13:44.54,It looks like your left hand could use a little support.
210,00:13:46.58,00:13:46.58,Could you? Um...
211,00:13:49.12,00:13:49.12,>> Michelle. >> Yeah.
212,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,>> I was not really excited for Sylvia to come back.
213,00:13:55.33,00:13:55.33,I already didn't have great feelings about her personality.
214,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,"I personally think she's a little bossy, and just likes to"
215,00:14:01.17,00:14:01.17,push people around. >> How about fishing along the
216,00:14:03.54,00:14:03.54,shore? >> We can try it.
217,00:14:06.96,00:14:06.96,">> You know, if this is low tide, we ought to go out and get"
218,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,"some oysters. >> In many ways, Sylvia's the"
219,00:14:14.12,00:14:14.12,outsider. She kind of does rub people the
220,00:14:16.71,00:14:16.71,"wrong way. I mean, it's not so much that"
221,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,she's a bad person. It's just that she's... for lack
222,00:14:22.54,00:14:22.54,"of a better word, she's bossy. >> Yep."
223,00:15:04.88,00:15:04.88,"If I throw the machete, are you going to catch it?"
224,00:15:11.29,00:15:11.29,>> There you go. >> Being on Survivor is pretty
225,00:15:14.50,00:15:14.50,much a little bit easier than being homeless.
226,00:15:17.25,00:15:17.25,"Hey, watch out! Look, I'm going to bring down a"
227,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,"family of them. >> Oh, that was a good one,"
228,00:15:23.00,00:15:23.00,buddy. You got six out of that.
229,00:15:25.96,00:15:25.96,">> When I was first homeless, I was about seven years old"
230,00:15:29.83,00:15:29.83,because my momma started doing drugs.
231,00:15:32.46,00:15:32.46,>> I wouldn't step on that one for too much security.
232,00:15:35.00,00:15:35.00,>> Our momma was a crackhead. And my brothers and sisters and
233,00:15:37.42,00:15:37.42,I decided all we got is each other and ourselves.
234,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,And so we used to just get the food out of the trash can that
235,00:15:42.83,00:15:42.83,"people throw away. It's very similar, having to go"
236,00:15:46.62,00:15:46.62,"out and get food, having to find food."
237,00:15:49.46,00:15:49.46,And when you find food you ain't going to be greedy and eat it
238,00:15:52.21,00:15:52.21,"yourself because you're hungry, because you know everybody else"
239,00:15:55.04,00:15:55.04,"is hungry, too. >> That's beautiful."
240,00:15:58.04,00:15:58.04,"That's a beautiful thing. >> There's so much more, there"
241,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,"are so many more. The more trees we find, the more"
242,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,we run wild. I know my teammates don't know
243,00:16:07.38,00:16:07.38,"what it's like to suffer. When I first got here, I was"
244,00:16:10.25,00:16:10.25,"like, ""What are these people doing here?"""
245,00:16:12.38,00:16:12.38,I don't think they know what it's like to struggle.
246,00:16:14.54,00:16:14.54,I think this is the most struggle some people had that's
247,00:16:17.46,00:16:17.46,"here, which is not really even a struggle to me."
248,00:16:19.88,00:16:19.88,This is easier than being homeless on the street.
249,00:16:22.21,00:16:22.21,I know people are going to be jealous.
250,00:16:24.46,00:16:24.46,"People sitting at home, they're going to be jealous, because"
251,00:16:26.71,00:16:26.71,we've got more food here than they have in their refrigerator.
252,00:16:29.12,00:16:29.12,">> Oh, wow. That would be sad."
253,00:16:31.83,00:16:31.83,">> Yeah, that would be really sad."
254,00:16:33.79,00:16:33.79,>> This is more food that I've got in my refrigerator.
255,00:16:36.29,00:16:36.29,>> I have a weight of responsibility to last in this
256,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,"game, because I do want to help my family."
257,00:16:40.54,00:16:40.54,I'm in an amazing spot in my life right now.
258,00:16:45.04,00:16:45.04,I'm going to help my family when I get back.
259,00:17:02.62,00:17:02.62,>> Ahoy! I am beyond starving.
260,00:17:07.88,00:17:07.88,"I'm looking for anything, any tree of life, anything."
261,00:17:13.83,00:17:13.83,">> Look on the ground, man. >> Hey, this is something."
262,00:17:19.79,00:17:19.79,"Are those nuts? >> Mango, bro."
263,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,">> Yeah, it's a mango. This is definitely the beginning"
264,00:17:25.38,00:17:25.38,stages. Can't eat them.
265,00:17:28.29,00:17:28.29,I'm going to go up here a little bit more and see.
266,00:17:48.46,00:17:48.46,"We went all the way up to the top, around, nothing."
267,00:17:51.79,00:17:51.79,I went all the way up that way. There's no other fruit here.
268,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,"Nothing. >> Oh, my god."
269,00:18:12.46,00:18:12.46,Pineapples. There are so many of them.
270,00:18:15.62,00:18:15.62,"Hey! >> Oh, my god!"
271,00:18:19.21,00:18:19.21,>> Pineapples. This is ready.
272,00:18:22.46,00:18:22.46,>> Pineapple! >> We're running around hungry
273,00:18:25.46,00:18:25.46,and stupid for the past few days.
274,00:18:27.75,00:18:27.75,We've been looking over there. >> Amazing!
275,00:18:30.42,00:18:30.42,>> Beautiful! >> We've been trekking the whole
276,00:18:32.83,00:18:32.83,"island, climbing mountains and stuff, and right in front of us"
277,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,"has been, like, hundreds of pineapples, sitting there."
278,00:18:40.88,00:18:40.88,">> Oh, my god! >> Erica, you're the hero."
279,00:18:45.67,00:18:45.67,">> Oh, my god! >> No way!"
280,00:18:49.12,00:18:49.12,">> Oh, sweet! >> Oh, my god!"
281,00:18:53.58,00:18:53.58,>> We've got pineapple power for the challenge tomorrow.
282,00:18:56.54,00:18:56.54,>> This is huge. This is... now I'll be ready.
283,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,"I'll be ready. Wow, a miracle."
284,00:19:02.58,00:19:02.58,"And she just stumbled on to it. Me and Erica, we're getting"
285,00:19:05.38,00:19:05.38,married now. She just saved my life.
286,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,And I appreciate that. That's a good woman.
287,00:19:11.00,00:19:11.00,>> I just want to smile. I just want to smile.
288,00:19:21.75,00:19:21.75,>> Yo! >> Hey!
289,00:19:25.88,00:19:25.88,>> What is that thing? >> Tree mail?
290,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,>> Bring it here. >> Is that fire?
291,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,>> We got mail. >> No.
292,00:19:35.25,00:19:35.25,"No fire, stupid. He goes, ""Fire?"""
293,00:19:37.00,00:19:37.00,"Yeah, I got fire right here, buddy."
294,00:19:39.08,00:19:39.08,"""Run, paddle, pull, think. This one's anybody's game."
295,00:19:43.21,00:19:43.21,"Teamwork and the will to win..."" >> We've got the will!"
296,00:19:45.46,00:19:45.46,We've got the will! >> That's right.
297,00:19:47.46,00:19:47.46,"...""helps with food and saves your flame."""
298,00:19:49.67,00:19:49.67,">> Key word, ""flame,"" baby. We've got fire."
299,00:19:53.67,00:19:53.67,>> We've got flint. We've got heart.
300,00:19:57.71,00:19:57.71,>> I am not going to have any problems kicking butt today.
301,00:20:02.92,00:20:02.92,It's definitely all about payback today.
302,00:20:05.21,00:20:05.21,"I mean, we helped build that shelter."
303,00:20:07.42,00:20:07.42,We wasted all of our fresh energy on making that camp home.
304,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,So today is the day that we can get back at them and we can make
305,00:20:14.21,00:20:14.21,them suffer a little bit. >> Ow!
306,00:20:18.04,00:20:18.04,>> I want to win for many reasons.
307,00:20:22.17,00:20:22.17,"I'm the most vulnerable member of the tribe right now, having"
308,00:20:25.21,00:20:25.21,"been an outsider, and I've realized for a couple of days"
309,00:20:28.96,00:20:28.96,"now, of course, that the immunity idol is here at camp."
310,00:20:31.96,00:20:31.96,"But I haven't had the strength, the energy, or really"
311,00:20:35.62,00:20:35.62,opportunity to go look for it. So there is no option for me to
312,00:20:38.08,00:20:38.08,lose. Because I know the consequences.
313,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,>> I hope y'all feel that nervousness coming on.
314,00:20:54.38,00:20:54.38,It's time. It's go-home day.
315,00:20:56.54,00:20:56.54,It's go-home day for somebody. Somebody got to go home today.
316,00:20:59.71,00:20:59.71,And we don't plan on it being us.
317,00:21:01.71,00:21:01.71,"It's go-home day, and we want to stay on go-home day."
318,00:21:04.12,00:21:04.12,">> Y'all doing it, I'm going it. It's definitely game on, and"
319,00:21:08.04,00:21:08.04,we're pumped. We're pumped in more ways than
320,00:21:10.04,00:21:10.04,they can imagine. Our tribe has a distinct
321,00:21:12.42,00:21:12.42,advantage. It's a huge advantage where
322,00:21:14.83,00:21:14.83,"we've been fed, we've been happy, we've been cracking up"
323,00:21:17.12,00:21:17.12,"laughing, we've been sleeping well."
324,00:21:19.12,00:21:19.12,We're going to be calm. We're going to be steady.
325,00:21:21.17,00:21:21.17,"They're going to be nervous. We don't want to lose, but we"
326,00:21:23.33,00:21:23.33,know in our minds we're not starting from the bottom
327,00:21:25.54,00:21:25.54,"anymore. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
328,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,"Moto, getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe."
329,00:21:43.38,00:21:43.38,Jessica voted out at the first tribal council.
330,00:21:46.12,00:21:46.12,Sylvia has taken her spot. First order of business.
331,00:21:50.79,00:21:50.79,"Sylvia, your buff. You're now official."
332,00:21:54.25,00:21:54.25,">> Finally. >> PROBST: All right, first"
333,00:21:59.25,00:21:59.25,things first. Take back immunity.
334,00:22:06.00,00:22:06.00,"Immunity, back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each"
335,00:22:09.92,00:22:09.92,tribe will paddle in a canoe out and around your tribe flag.
336,00:22:14.42,00:22:14.42,"On your way back, you must collect four supply crates."
337,00:22:17.83,00:22:17.83,"Each time you paddle over a crate, one tribe member will"
338,00:22:21.25,00:22:21.25,"attach a long rope to the crate. Once you're back to shore,"
339,00:22:26.00,00:22:26.00,you'll pull the crates in and carry them to your tribe mat.
340,00:22:29.42,00:22:29.42,"When you have all four crates on your mat, you'll untie them to"
341,00:22:32.21,00:22:32.21,find six puzzle pole pieces and a flag.
342,00:22:36.75,00:22:36.75,The first tribe to correctly assemble their puzzle pole with
343,00:22:39.62,00:22:39.62,their flag and raise it wins the challenge.
344,00:22:42.79,00:22:42.79,Want to know what you're playing for?
345,00:22:44.54,00:22:44.54,>> Yes. >> PROBST: A lot of fishing
346,00:22:47.54,00:22:47.54,gear. >> Nice.
347,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,">> Oh, man. >> PROBST: Ravu, because you"
348,00:22:52.75,00:22:52.75,"still do not have fire, you're still playing for fire in the"
349,00:22:55.79,00:22:55.79,"form of flint. >> Let's get it, baby."
350,00:22:58.12,00:22:58.12,>> PROBST: Talk about making a change.
351,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,"It would be nice to have some water, wouldn't it?"
352,00:23:01.83,00:23:01.83,">> Yes, it would. >> PROBST: And the most"
353,00:23:03.46,00:23:03.46,"important thing in this game, immunity."
354,00:23:05.29,00:23:05.29,"In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the"
355,00:23:07.83,00:23:07.83,losing tribe to go to Exile Island.
356,00:23:11.50,00:23:11.50,"There is a lot at stake, winner take all."
357,00:23:14.67,00:23:14.67,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
358,00:23:16.46,00:23:16.46,">> PROBST: Give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started."
359,00:23:22.92,00:23:22.92,Here we go. Ravu looking for some revenge.
360,00:23:25.12,00:23:25.12,Moto looking to put them deeper in the hole.
361,00:23:28.25,00:23:28.25,"For reward and immunity, survivors ready?"
362,00:23:30.96,00:23:30.96,Go! Got to go out past your flag and
363,00:23:42.00,00:23:42.00,then head back! >> Row!
364,00:23:44.58,00:23:44.58,Row! Row!
365,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,"Dig deep, you guys! >> All right, you guys, reverse"
366,00:23:50.29,00:23:50.29,"it, reverse it. >> Start backpedaling."
367,00:23:52.75,00:23:52.75,>> Go backwards. >> PROBST: Ravu makes the turn.
368,00:23:58.04,00:23:58.04,Moto makes the turn. Both tribes dead even as they
369,00:24:00.96,00:24:00.96,pass their flag heading back. Rain starting to come down.
370,00:24:06.83,00:24:06.83,"Ravu right on line. >> Say when, say when."
371,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,>> PROBST: Michelle clips in for Ravu.
372,00:24:15.46,00:24:15.46,>> Push! Push!
373,00:24:17.38,00:24:17.38,>> PROBST: Stacy clips in for Moto.
374,00:24:20.33,00:24:20.33,>> Don't stop! Don't stop!
375,00:24:22.50,00:24:22.50,>> Row! >> PROBST: Ravu with a bit of a
376,00:24:24.92,00:24:24.92,lead. Ravu clipped into their second

384,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,extending the lead. >> Backpedal here.
385,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,Backpedal! Backpedal!
386,00:24:58.08,00:24:58.08,">> You guys, keep it going. >> PROBST: Michelle has clipped"
387,00:25:04.83,00:25:04.83,in the fourth and final crate for Ravu.
388,00:25:08.04,00:25:08.04,They're heading back to shore. >> Let's go!
389,00:25:10.42,00:25:10.42,>> Stacy clips in with the third crate for Moto
390,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,">> Untangle that rope. Come on, let's go!"
391,00:25:19.12,00:25:19.12,>> PROBST: Moto clipping into their fourth crate.
392,00:25:21.71,00:25:21.71,They're heading to shore. It's going to come down to

395,00:25:36.08,00:25:36.08,Ravu working together very well. Still with the lead.
396,00:25:39.92,00:25:39.92,"Ravu, got to get that fourth crate up there."
397,00:25:43.88,00:25:43.88,"Keep moving! Go, start untying!"
398,00:25:48.08,00:25:48.08,Ravu untying their crates. Moto back with their third

406,00:26:23.83,00:26:23.83,right. Nobody's listening.

414,00:27:19.42,00:27:19.42,"of fishing gear. Ravu, more bad news for you."
415,00:27:23.04,00:27:23.04,Somebody's going to be going to Exile Island.
416,00:27:25.50,00:27:25.50,The only saving grace is that whoever Moto chooses will be
417,00:27:29.08,00:27:29.08,safe from tribal council tonight.
418,00:27:31.75,00:27:31.75,"Moto, give me your decision. >> It's Earl."
419,00:27:35.54,00:27:35.54,">> PROBST: Okay, Earl. Boat's waiting for you."
420,00:27:38.79,00:27:38.79,You will get another clue to the whereabouts of a hidden immunity
421,00:27:41.12,00:27:41.12,idol. Watch out for the sea snakes.
422,00:27:43.67,00:27:43.67,">> I'll eat them. >> PROBST: Ravu, tonight you"
423,00:27:47.04,00:27:47.04,lose another member to tribal council.
424,00:27:50.17,00:27:50.17,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
425,00:27:52.04,00:27:52.04,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp."
426,00:28:15.17,00:28:15.17,">> ""Here you won't find the idol you crave."
427,00:28:17.58,00:28:17.58,"Search back at your camp if you hope to be saved."""
428,00:28:20.62,00:28:20.62,"Clue number two: ""To search with success you must"
429,00:28:23.29,00:28:23.29,become centered under the highest point upon which you
430,00:28:25.79,00:28:25.79,"have entered."" Back at the camp where I just"
431,00:28:28.46,00:28:28.46,left? Wow!
432,00:28:31.79,00:28:31.79,To find out that the idol was back at camp was very shocking.
433,00:28:34.21,00:28:34.21,"But it doesn't really matter that Sylvia has that first clue,"
434,00:28:37.12,00:28:37.12,"because as of tonight, she most likely will be gone."
435,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,Exile is an upgrade from how we were living.
436,00:28:48.54,00:28:48.54,"For one, I have fire. But at the same time, I'm not"
437,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17,involved on what's going on at the camp.
438,00:29:01.54,00:29:01.54,There's a freaking snake. The highly poisonous sea snake.
439,00:29:17.67,00:29:17.67,Can't take that chance. Can't take that chance.
440,00:29:22.04,00:29:22.04,That same one. It's like Saving Private Ryan.
441,00:29:25.42,00:29:25.42,"If you let that one go, it might come back and get you later."
442,00:29:28.29,00:29:28.29,"Sorry, buddy. I really don't like killing"
443,00:29:31.04,00:29:31.04,animals. Snakes are misunderstood.
444,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,But we have an understanding now.
445,00:29:48.21,00:29:48.21,">> That one was a tough loss, guys."
446,00:29:50.71,00:29:50.71,Just wait till the challenges when there aren't no puzzles.
447,00:29:52.75,00:29:52.75,"We'll kill everybody, you know what I mean?"
448,00:29:55.12,00:29:55.12,>> I love you. >> It's the puzzles that kick
449,00:29:57.21,00:29:57.21,"our ass every time, bro, every time."
450,00:30:00.17,00:30:00.17,">> Here we are, we bust our asses today, and what do we got?"
451,00:30:04.67,00:30:04.67,Nothing. Empty-handed.
452,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,"You know, we can't even win with the sun."
453,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,And now we've got to go to tribal council again.
454,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,And that's just frustrating. I'm just mad.
455,00:30:13.29,00:30:13.29,"I'm mad and a whole lot tired, and it's only day six."
456,00:30:20.58,00:30:20.58,"It's only day six! I just want some freaking water,"
457,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,that's all. >> I'd say Erica panicked today.
458,00:30:48.12,00:30:48.12,"You know, she was kind of grumpy and screaming, which is all"
459,00:30:51.12,00:30:51.12,"right, because we always... you know, lot of us are."
460,00:30:53.92,00:30:53.92,"But not at the challenges, you know?"
461,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,"She's screaming, she's yelling at people about pieces, this and"
462,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,"that, when it wasn't even her place to be there."
463,00:31:14.25,00:31:14.25,">> Mookie's probably going to be my partner in crime, you know."
464,00:31:17.00,00:31:17.00,"We pretty much made an alliance, and that way we can manipulate"
465,00:31:19.62,00:31:19.62,"everybody and just get it done. I know it sounds bad, bro, but"
466,00:31:24.00,00:31:24.00,what am I going to do? What am I going to do?
467,00:31:27.04,00:31:27.04,"All right, come up here so I can talk to you."
468,00:31:30.88,00:31:30.88,Come on. Come on.
469,00:31:33.38,00:31:33.38,"So we're switching it out, bro. >> Oh, we're switching it out?"
470,00:31:36.58,00:31:36.58,">> Yeah. So Erica is going to go now, and"
471,00:31:38.75,00:31:38.75,"if and when the next time we lose, Sylvia goes next."
472,00:31:41.54,00:31:41.54,>> Wouldn't you rather get rid of Sylvia now?
473,00:31:43.50,00:31:43.50,">> No, no, because Erica is the threat."
474,00:31:46.12,00:31:46.12,"Sylvia is not. >> Yeah, but we've got to get..."
475,00:31:48.12,00:31:48.12,we need the strength is the thing.
476,00:31:50.67,00:31:50.67,">> To be honest with you, I love her to death, but I can't always"
477,00:31:52.96,00:31:52.96,read her. I don't always know where she's
478,00:31:55.21,00:31:55.21,coming from. >> So you'd rather have Sylvia
479,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"here? >> No, Sylvia is next."
480,00:31:59.50,00:31:59.50,>> But we need to take out Erica.
481,00:32:01.58,00:32:01.58,">> Oh, no. >> She broke down today."
482,00:32:05.08,00:32:05.08,"She... when we had those poles in, when it didn't work, we"
483,00:32:07.38,00:32:07.38,"should have taken it out, she's like, ""No, do it again."""
484,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,">> Mookie said ""We're going to vote Erica off."""
485,00:32:12.25,00:32:12.25,"I said, ""Whoa!"" >> Things change real quick."
486,00:32:16.04,00:32:16.04,">> Yeah, they do. >> Gee, I thought my days were"
487,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,numbered here. Bye.
488,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,"If you have laundry, just bring it to us."
489,00:32:23.71,00:32:23.71,"And the one thing I learned, if nothing else, is when you're in"
490,00:32:26.67,00:32:26.67,"a situation like this, a survival situation, rule number"
491,00:32:29.42,00:32:29.42,one-- you keep your head. She was panicking and screaming
492,00:32:33.92,00:32:33.92,"in my ear. >> Explain to him, because he's"
493,00:32:36.00,00:32:36.00,"upset about it, and I don't blame him."
494,00:32:37.71,00:32:37.71,>> She was completely in a panic.
495,00:32:39.54,00:32:39.54,You have to stay calm as a team. When one person's yelling and
496,00:32:42.46,00:32:42.46,"screaming, we're all distracted. >> It's nothing personal, bro."
497,00:32:46.46,00:32:46.46,>> It's just performance. >> I know it's not personal.
498,00:32:48.62,00:32:48.62,I know it's not personal. >> I'm telling you.
499,00:32:50.38,00:32:50.38,>> Do you want to keep losing or no?
500,00:32:52.04,00:32:52.04,"It's up to you. >> Dude, do I look like I want"
501,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,"to keep losing? >> I'm just asking you, bro."
502,00:32:55.29,00:32:55.29,>> Do you want to ask me that question again?
503,00:32:57.08,00:32:57.08,">> Do you want to keep losing? Don't get all mad at me,"
504,00:32:58.58,00:32:58.58,brother. >> I'm not getting mad at you.
505,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,>> You're bickering with me for no reason.
506,00:33:02.08,00:33:02.08,">> I'm not bickering with you. Dude, I'm not bickering."
507,00:33:03.75,00:33:03.75,">> Okay. >> You're upset, guy."
508,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,>> I'm upset at the whole situation.
509,00:33:07.58,00:33:07.58,>> Who would you rather it be? >> I'm upset about the whole
510,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,"situation, man. This sucks."
511,00:33:16.04,00:33:16.04,">> You know, Erica lost her top. She completely blew her stack at"
512,00:33:18.62,00:33:18.62,"the challenge today. And because she panicked,"
513,00:33:22.46,00:33:22.46,everybody saw it. And those who didn't trust her a
514,00:33:26.12,00:33:26.12,"lot now just want her gone, which in many ways I think is a"
515,00:33:29.96,00:33:29.96,mistake for the tribe. I don't think it's smart.
516,00:33:32.54,00:33:32.54,"I don't think it's smart. >> No, I don't think so, either,"
517,00:33:34.42,00:33:34.42,"but then.... >> Right, it's the majority."
518,00:33:38.17,00:33:38.17,">> It's the majority. >> Okay, well..."
519,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,>> They've got the votes. They've got the votes.
520,00:33:44.17,00:33:44.17,>> They have enough already? >> Yeah.
521,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,">> Well, if they have enough already, let me put Sylvia, so I"
522,00:33:47.67,00:33:47.67,"can be like, ""I'm voting you because I don't like you."""
523,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,">> Okay, then that's cool. Then I'll vote for Sylvia, too."
524,00:33:53.21,00:33:53.21,I'm playing the game. So is everybody else.
525,00:33:55.29,00:33:55.29,You just have to play with what cards you're dealt.
526,00:33:57.62,00:33:57.62,And right now I've got a really funky hand.
527,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,"Getting rid of Sylvia in a lot of ways would probably be good,"
528,00:34:02.75,00:34:02.75,"you know, mental health for all of us."
529,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,We were all fine before she showed up.
530,00:34:07.88,00:34:07.88,We were actually all pretty tight before she showed up.
531,00:34:09.88,00:34:09.88,>> Here's my question. How did you feel before she got
532,00:34:14.08,00:34:14.08,here and after she got here? >> It was just kind of weird
533,00:34:16.75,00:34:16.75,when she got here. >> That's what I mean.
534,00:34:18.79,00:34:18.79,How did you feel before? >> I was cool.
535,00:34:21.00,00:34:21.00,>> I thought before we were... >> We were all good with who we
536,00:34:22.96,00:34:22.96,"had, you know? >> I mean, I feel like we have"
537,00:34:25.12,00:34:25.12,the right combination between the girls and the guys that we
538,00:34:28.62,00:34:28.62,"have to make it through. >> Well, if we keep it together"
539,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"and if you and I keep together, then we'll be good."
540,00:34:35.00,00:34:35.00,"So we'll do it, and we'll... >> Okay."
541,00:34:54.58,00:34:54.58,">> We get all the bad luck for losing, huh?"
542,00:34:57.88,00:34:57.88,>> Any more? >> If we landed in Bizarro World
543,00:35:01.96,00:35:01.96,and we end up with a split vote of four for Erica and four for
544,00:35:06.12,00:35:06.12,"Sylvia, I think a couple of people's heads would explode."
545,00:35:10.08,00:35:10.08,That would be a whole lot of people who have been lying to a
546,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,whole lot of other people who are already lying to a whole lot
547,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,of other people. Gives me cramps in my brain to
548,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,think about. I'm just hoping that we're not
549,00:35:26.75,00:35:26.75,"in Bizarro World, and everybody keeps up with what they're"
550,00:35:30.08,00:35:30.08,"planning to do, because, you know, in this game, you can't"
551,00:35:32.33,00:35:32.33,"take anything at face value. >> PROBST: Mookie, back-to-back"
552,00:35:54.79,00:35:54.79,losses in winner-take-all challenges.
553,00:35:57.96,00:35:57.96,How big of a hole is this tribe in right now?
554,00:36:01.88,00:36:01.88,">> We're in a deep hole. We still have no fire, which"
555,00:36:04.96,00:36:04.96,means no water. We're running out of coconuts.
556,00:36:08.04,00:36:08.04,We're tired. We're in a hole.
557,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"We need to win. >> PROBST: Anthony, what do you"
558,00:36:13.79,00:36:13.79,think went wrong in today's challenge?
559,00:36:16.38,00:36:16.38,>> I think there was too many people trying to help out in
560,00:36:19.46,00:36:19.46,things where they should have backed off and let the original
561,00:36:21.96,00:36:21.96,people who we thought were going to take care of it take care of
562,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,"it. >> PROBST: What I saw today,"
563,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,"Erica, was you at one point screaming, ""It goes like this!"
564,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,"It goes like this!"" Can that be an interference?"
565,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,">> A lot of people tried a lot of different pieces, and I was"
566,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"really trying to help out, give some input."
567,00:36:38.21,00:36:38.21,I'm passionate about my team. I'm passionate about winning.
568,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"And I feel like putting my input in wasn't such a bad thing, and"
569,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,all I asked them to do was to go back and try it again.
570,00:36:46.79,00:36:46.79,">> PROBST: Sylvia, you divide these tribes, then you leave."
571,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,You come back. Did you feel welcomed?
572,00:36:54.62,00:36:54.62,">> Actually, I felt kind of like an outsider."
573,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,"They had the challenge itself, and then going back to camp,"
574,00:37:02.08,00:37:02.08,"putting it together, and then having to come here, and that's"
575,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"a lot of bonding. So by the time I showed up, I"
576,00:37:08.58,00:37:08.58,"felt I was on the outside. >> PROBST: Rocky, what was your"
577,00:37:12.92,00:37:12.92,reaction to Sylvia coming back and joining the tribe?
578,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,">> Sylvia is used to leading. She's used to, you know,"
579,00:37:18.83,00:37:18.83,dictating and telling people what to do.
580,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,"But whatever she tries to put across, she's doing it in a"
581,00:37:23.25,00:37:23.25,"positive way. >> PROBST: Anthony, is what"
582,00:37:25.88,00:37:25.88,Rocky said true? Is Sylvia more of a leader?
583,00:37:28.96,00:37:28.96,">> Bless you, Sylvia. You have a wonderful habit of"
584,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,"kind of throwing out an idea and saying, ""Let's do it,"" and not"
585,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,actually talking with anybody about doing it.
586,00:37:37.25,00:37:37.25,">> PROBST: So, again, Sylvia, people are saying you're"
587,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,somewhat of a leader. Is this surprising to you?
588,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,">> A little, because I came in late."
589,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,So I could not be the leader just walking in off Exile Island
590,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,"and say, ""Okay, everybody, clear the way."
591,00:37:50.29,00:37:50.29,"I'm leader."" But I can offer ideas."
592,00:37:52.96,00:37:52.96,"An idea that's been gurgling in my head, which I haven't brought"
593,00:37:55.71,00:37:55.71,"up to everybody, but tomorrow when we're fresh, when we wake"
594,00:37:59.71,00:37:59.71,"up, is to assign a leader. >> PROBST: So Yau-Man, last"
595,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,"tribal council it was ""Let's get rid of the weakest member, make"
596,00:38:06.04,00:38:06.04,"our tribe stronger."" What's the criteria this time"
597,00:38:09.04,00:38:09.04,for voting somebody out? >> The criteria this time I
598,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,"think is to have a more cohesive tribe, to form a tribe where we"
599,00:38:19.79,00:38:19.79,get along better and be open to discussion and get rid of
600,00:38:22.71,00:38:22.71,"someone who is too vocal or too stubborn, who is too arrogant"
601,00:38:26.25,00:38:26.25,"about things. >> PROBST: Okay, before we get"
602,00:38:29.96,00:38:29.96,"to the vote, here are the rules about the hidden immunity idol."
603,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,It is good through the final five.
604,00:38:35.54,00:38:35.54,"If you decide to play it, you will do so after the votes have"
605,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,"been cast, but before I read them."
606,00:38:41.38,00:38:41.38,You can also give it to someone else at that point.
607,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,If the person who uses the idol does in fact have the highest
608,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,"number of votes, then the person with the next highest number of"
609,00:38:50.12,00:38:50.12,"votes would be sent home. Okay, it is time to vote."
610,00:38:54.42,00:38:54.42,"Erica, you're up. >> I just can't read you"
611,00:39:10.75,00:39:10.75,anymore. And quite frankly you're the
612,00:39:12.71,00:39:12.71,"biggest threat right now. Sorry, baby."
613,00:39:26.04,00:39:26.04,>> I'm voting for you because you've been a little bit pushy
614,00:39:29.25,00:39:29.25,for me. I'm sorry.
615,00:39:44.04,00:39:44.04,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
616,00:39:57.33,00:39:57.33,">> PROBST: If anyone has the idol and wants to play it, now"
617,00:39:59.54,00:39:59.54,is the time to do so. Okay.
618,00:40:05.17,00:40:05.17,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
619,00:40:07.38,00:40:07.38,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
620,00:40:09.42,00:40:09.42,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
621,00:40:12.75,00:40:12.75,"First vote, Erica. Sylvia."
622,00:40:23.75,00:40:23.75,"Erica. Two vote Erica, one vote Sylvia."
623,00:40:29.67,00:40:29.67,"Sylvia. Two votes Sylvia, two votes"
624,00:40:32.79,00:40:32.79,Erica. Erica.
625,00:40:38.38,00:40:38.38,That's three votes Erica. Erica.
626,00:40:46.33,00:40:46.33,"Four votes Erica, two votes Sylvia."
627,00:40:52.29,00:40:52.29,Second person voted out of Survivor: Fiji.
628,00:41:07.12,00:41:07.12,"Erica, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
629,00:41:23.00,00:41:23.00,Not much to say. This tribe has to find a way to
630,00:41:26.12,00:41:26.12,"win. Once again, you will be going"
631,00:41:28.92,00:41:28.92,back to camp without fire. Grab your stuff.
632,00:41:32.17,00:41:32.17,Head on out. Good night.
633,00:41:47.79,00:41:47.79,>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
634,00:41:53.50,00:41:53.50,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
635,00:41:56.92,00:41:56.92,Sylvia digs for immunity. >> I'm pretty sure I know where
636,00:41:58.79,00:41:58.79,the idol is. >> Whoa!
637,00:42:01.08,00:42:01.08,>> PROBST: Ravu sparks a flame. >> We're not going to die!
638,00:42:03.58,00:42:03.58,>> We finally got the shot in the ass we needed.
639,00:42:05.79,00:42:05.79,>> PROBST: And a Moto member is in trouble.
640,00:42:08.71,00:42:08.71,>> He can't breathe. He was afraid.
641,00:42:10.58,00:42:10.58,He said he didn't want to die in Fiji.
642,00:42:18.12,00:42:18.12,">> I was very, very shocked by the vote tonight."
643,00:42:20.88,00:42:20.88,It kind of hurts to get blindsided like that.
644,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,I don't think it was a smart move to vote off somebody who
645,00:42:25.92,00:42:25.92,was strong. When the next challenge comes
646,00:42:28.00,00:42:28.00,"around, I hope you guys win, but if you don't, I want you to"
647,00:42:30.17,00:42:30.17,think about voting me off and think about who you kept.
648,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,And if you go home empty-handed maybe you should think about the
649,00:42:35.17,00:42:35.17,decision that you made.
