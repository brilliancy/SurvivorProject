457,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"I've ever played in my life, andit's because of the people that"
458,00:32:05.96,00:32:05.96,I played with.Everyone fought to play this
459,00:32:09.75,00:32:09.75,"game as hard as they could, soI'm ready to pay my respects."
460,00:32:13.96,00:32:13.96,They deserve it.>> Sugar!

462,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,faith in myself this trip thanthe last time I played Survivor.
463,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,That's the hardest thing aboutthis game.
464,00:32:32.21,00:32:32.21,You can't play with your heartall the time.
465,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,You have to play with your head.You can't win this game playing
466,00:32:37.58,00:32:37.58,good all the time.You just can't.
467,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,I proved that.>> Stephenie!

469,00:32:48.29,00:32:48.29,">> Yeah, I was kind of shockedthat she went out second, she"
470,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,was such a tough competitor.>> Yeah.
471,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,>> Yeah.>> I did get hurt on the first
472,00:32:55.71,00:32:55.71,"day, but it's a part of thegame."
473,00:32:59.25,00:32:59.25,"I can live with it.I mean, I definitely think"
474,00:33:01.38,00:33:01.38,people were gunning for mebecause I had such a reputation
475,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,for being such a strongcompetitor.
476,00:33:06.08,00:33:06.08,My reputation was probably oneof my hardest things to
477,00:33:09.08,00:33:09.08,"overcome.>> Oh, Randy!"
478,00:33:18.62,00:33:18.62,Randy-- every morning made mesmile and laugh.
479,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,He was a good friend to me.>> My lack of ability to
480,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,"communicate with 26-year-oldgirls is what got me booted,"
481,00:33:31.38,00:33:31.38,ultimately.And I'm not ashamed of that.
482,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,What phases me is having peopleclearly stupider than me
483,00:33:38.88,00:33:38.88,"controlling my fate, and there'snothing I can do about it."
484,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,>> Cirie.>> She was vicious in the

487,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,She's really tough.>> I attempted to play different
488,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,"this time, but I felt like Iwasn't given a chance."
489,00:34:03.04,00:34:03.04,"I feel like people came in, youknow, with ""We got to get her."
490,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,"She's a schemer,"" just straightout."
491,00:34:07.46,00:34:07.46,You don't even know if that wasthe game I was going to play
492,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,"this time.You know, so never judge a book"
493,00:34:13.58,00:34:13.58,"by its cover.>> Oh, Tom."
494,00:34:23.04,00:34:23.04,>> He seemed like a realtrustworthy person.
495,00:34:25.08,00:34:25.08,">> He was the first winner togo, too."
496,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,What a shame.>> The fact that you can be the
497,00:34:30.96,00:34:30.96,winner and dominate one seasonand be the cast-aside who gets
498,00:34:36.88,00:34:36.88,dropped for a guy who's jumpingaround on one foot in your next
499,00:34:40.58,00:34:40.58,season I think is what makes thegame special and what made it
500,00:34:45.21,00:34:45.21,worth playing.>> Tyson!
501,00:34:55.79,00:34:55.79,>> Oh! He had such a senseof humor.
502,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,>> The funny guy.>> When you play with these
503,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,"all-stars, everybody's justout for blood immediately."
504,00:35:03.08,00:35:03.08,I was in control until I made astupid move.
505,00:35:05.92,00:35:05.92,I was basically the victim of myown stupidity.
506,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,"America thinks I'm an idiot,but as far as I'm concerned,"
507,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,I'm still the winner.>> Careful.
508,00:35:26.00,00:35:26.00,">> James!Seriously, what a competitor,"
509,00:35:28.88,00:35:28.88,"though.I mean, he hurt his knee and he"
510,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,still competed in the next twochallenges.
511,00:35:32.79,00:35:32.79,">> When the big guys fall, theyfall hard."
512,00:35:36.67,00:35:36.67,>> This time I actually tried tobe a little more conversational
513,00:35:39.50,00:35:39.50,with with people.I talked more.
514,00:35:41.08,00:35:41.08,"I was more friendly, I guess.There was this injury, and"
515,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,"something you have to deal with.I had a great time, but an"
516,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"injury got me in the end again.>> So, Rob."
517,00:35:56.58,00:35:56.58,">> Boston Rob.>> Rob, if you ain't with me,"
518,00:35:59.96,00:35:59.96,you against me.>> Boston Rob!

521,00:36:07.96,00:36:07.96,>> Leave him alone!>> He did do a lot for morale in
522,00:36:10.25,00:36:10.25,the beginning.>> Yeah.
523,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,">> Yeah.>> He told me one time, he said,"

526,00:36:20.79,00:36:20.79,">> When I first played thisgame, I was 25 years old."
527,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"I'm 33 now, and I can still hangin there with the young guys."
528,00:36:28.62,00:36:28.62,"I can still do it, but, youknow, at one point I passed out,"
529,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,"but I came through all right.You know, the new generation of"
530,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,players are smarter now.I got to applaud them for
531,00:36:39.75,00:36:39.75,getting rid of me.It's the first smart thing
532,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,they've done in 20 seasons.They're starting to learn.
533,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,">> Careful.>> Oh, Coach."

949,01:05:23.04,01:05:23.04,making it to the final three.>> I'm bringing people that
950,01:05:27.12,01:05:27.12,other people don't like.Parvati has a lot of enemies.
951,01:05:30.54,01:05:30.54,"Sandra-- she didn't do nothing.At the end of the day, the"
952,01:05:32.54,01:05:32.54,reason she's here is 'causeshe's easy to beat.

962,01:05:53.21,01:05:53.21,>> I would have voted forSandra.
963,01:05:55.21,01:05:55.21,">> No, you... Seriously?>> I told you."
964,01:05:57.21,01:05:57.21,>> Wow.>> I have played the game of

967,01:06:05.96,01:06:05.96,But I think it also makes meone of the best players of

973,01:06:23.92,01:06:23.92,This is it.Every man for himself now.

976,01:06:33.67,01:06:33.67,my villain side this timearound.
977,01:06:36.21,01:06:36.21,And you know what?I've put my heart and soul into
978,01:06:39.12,01:06:39.12,"this game, and I'm here to win,and that's what I want."
979,01:06:43.04,01:06:43.04,He's so full of himself.>> We're gonna lay this bomb on

985,01:06:58.79,01:06:58.79,"Oh, my God, do it!>> So he can take his"
986,01:07:00.92,01:07:00.92,bald-headed ass to be in TribalCouncil.
987,01:07:03.21,01:07:03.21,(Parvati laughs)Are you gonna tell?
988,01:07:05.17,01:07:05.17,>> Uh-uh.Are you kidding?
989,01:07:08.17,01:07:08.17,(Parvati laughs)>> That's how much game I've
990,01:07:11.42,01:07:11.42,got.(Parvati laughs)
991,01:07:15.08,01:07:15.08,">> Good work, lady.>> Mm."
992,01:07:18.38,01:07:18.38,">> Russell is obnoxious, so Itook his hat, and I threw it in"

994,01:07:25.38,01:07:25.38,I should burn his sneakers.(Parvati laughs)
995,01:07:29.25,01:07:29.25,He could take his bald-headedtail to Tribal Council.
996,01:07:31.33,01:07:31.33,It'll be all right.He can wear his buff on his
997,01:07:33.88,01:07:33.88,"head.He has a big, bald patch right"
998,01:07:36.17,01:07:36.17,"here, he doesn't want nobody toknow about."
999,01:07:38.88,01:07:38.88,But we've been here for 39 days.I've seen it a whole ton of
1000,01:07:41.71,01:07:41.71,times.Screw it.
1001,01:07:43.71,01:07:43.71,That's payback for everythinghe's done to me in this game.
1002,01:07:46.50,01:07:46.50,I don't care.>> No.
1003,01:07:52.62,01:07:52.62,">> What the hell.Yeah, y'all haven't seen it?"
1004,01:07:54.67,01:07:54.67,>> No.Did you pack it?
1005,01:07:56.67,01:07:56.67,>> I put it right there.>> Oh.
1006,01:07:58.71,01:07:58.71,>> I know I did.>> I don't think it's about the
1007,01:08:01.12,01:08:01.12,money tonight.I think it's about the title of
1008,01:08:04.04,01:08:04.04,Sole Survivor.That's all Russell wants.
1009,01:08:07.08,01:08:07.08,"And if that's what Russellwants, that's what I got to make"
1010,01:08:09.67,01:08:09.67,"sure Russell does not get.>> I don't get my hat, I ain't"
1011,01:08:12.25,01:08:12.25,"leaving, though.>> Well, we're going to have to"

1013,01:08:16.29,01:08:16.29,>> There's not a day that didn'tgo by that I was trying to focus
1014,01:08:19.29,01:08:19.29,"on, what's the best way for meto get rid of Russell."
1015,01:08:23.29,01:08:23.29,>> Okay!>> And the worst thing of all is
1016,01:08:27.54,01:08:27.54,"that those Heroes, each andevery one of them, are"
1017,01:08:30.71,01:08:30.71,responsible for their ownself-destruction.
1018,01:08:32.75,01:08:32.75,"You do it, girl.(whooping)"
1019,01:08:34.75,01:08:34.75,"When I was out here, I had tohustle."
1020,01:08:37.29,01:08:37.29,I had to make sure all my stuffwas in order so that when I went
1021,01:08:41.04,01:08:41.04,"to Tribal Council, I made it outin one piece."
1022,01:08:43.71,01:08:43.71,I didn't hide behind no immunitynecklace.
1023,01:08:46.17,01:08:46.17,I never had safety.I had to take care of myself.
1024,01:08:49.04,01:08:49.04,(whoops)Look at it go wild.
1025,01:08:53.04,01:08:53.04,"And yet, here I sit, finalthree."
1026,01:08:56.25,01:08:56.25,I think I deserve it.I want the title of Sole
1027,01:08:59.42,01:08:59.42,Survivor.>> Yeah.
1028,01:09:01.50,01:09:01.50,">> The Heroes built it, and theVillains burn it down."

1050,01:10:52.46,01:10:52.46,I've been sole surviving sincemy alliance was wiped out.
1051,01:10:55.62,01:10:55.62,I got to the Heroes' camp.I tried to get rid of Russell
1052,01:10:59.00,01:10:59.00,three different times.I'd have to work my way around
1053,01:11:02.25,01:11:02.25,"things at camp, try to make sureto take all the precautionary"
1054,01:11:05.92,01:11:05.92,"measures to ensure that when Ibrought my torch in here lit,"
1055,01:11:10.17,01:11:10.17,that it left here lit.And I did that by myself.

1057,01:11:21.25,01:11:21.25,thinks that this game is a gameof luck.

1059,01:11:26.54,01:11:26.54,is.I played as hard as I possibly
1060,01:11:29.21,01:11:29.21,"could play, and for some reason,you know, when I come here, I"
1061,01:11:32.88,01:11:32.88,feel that people look at me likeI did something wrong.
1062,01:11:35.17,01:11:35.17,You know.I tried to play hard.
1063,01:11:37.88,01:11:37.88,That's what I did.If I did anything to offend
1064,01:11:40.50,01:11:40.50,"anybody in this game, Iapologize."
1065,01:11:43.08,01:11:43.08,But I played the game.That's all I can say.

1069,01:11:58.12,01:11:58.12,threat that I was to everyone inthis game.
1070,01:12:02.08,01:12:02.08,"So immediately, I had to put aline of defense together, and"
1071,01:12:05.96,01:12:05.96,"that's where Russell came in.He was, um, the dragon."
1072,01:12:11.12,01:12:11.12,"And instead of slaying him, Ikept him as my pet."
1073,01:12:17.46,01:12:17.46,"And he displayed his loyalty atthe end to me, and only to me."
1074,01:12:21.79,01:12:21.79,"You know, I think I played theultimate social game, the"

1090,01:13:24.58,01:13:24.58,need to learn a little bit aboutstrategic plays you made beyond

1092,01:13:30.96,01:13:30.96,But I want to know what makesyou more impressive than those

1100,01:13:54.04,01:13:54.04,Probably the riskiest move thatI made was the day that I had
1101,01:13:56.88,01:13:56.88,"two idols, because I talked toAmanda to see if I could trust"

1117,01:14:50.25,01:14:50.25,"Tribal, and you said that youcrossed the line, I think you"
1118,01:14:52.96,01:14:52.96,might be one of the strongestpeople in the game.
1119,01:14:55.92,01:14:55.92,"Sandra, I've always said I likedtaking the strongest to the end,"
1120,01:14:59.92,01:14:59.92,"and, unfortunately, you werefairly useless in challenges."
1121,01:15:04.17,01:15:04.17,"I played with strength, withhonor and with integrity."
1122,01:15:07.46,01:15:07.46,And I wish I could be there inyour stead.
1123,01:15:11.29,01:15:11.29,"Parvati, I got to tell you thatcoming into this game, I was"
1124,01:15:15.33,01:15:15.33,dead wrong about you-- that youwere going to be a weak player
1125,01:15:18.04,01:15:18.04,in the challenges.You were a warrior in
1126,01:15:20.96,01:15:20.96,"challenges, and I respect that.The ironic twist of fate is, the"
1127,01:15:27.04,01:15:27.04,day that I finally trusted youwas the day that you turned on
1128,01:15:30.67,01:15:30.67,"me.As a Christian man, I give you"
1129,01:15:33.50,01:15:33.50,my word that I came in heretonight without any preconceived
1130,01:15:37.04,01:15:37.04,"notions of who I was going tovote for, and I will be"
1131,01:15:39.62,01:15:39.62,"watching, listening, and I'llbe voting for a million dollars."
1132,01:15:44.17,01:15:44.17,I have taken that responsibilityquite seriously for this game
1133,01:15:48.04,01:15:48.04,"that I love.>> PROBST: Amanda, you're up."
1134,01:15:54.79,01:15:54.79,(Amanda sighs)>> Hi.
1135,01:15:56.92,01:15:56.92,"Um, Sandra, my question for youis-- tell me how your strategy"
1136,01:16:03.88,01:16:03.88,was better in the game thanRussell and Parvati.
1137,01:16:06.25,01:16:06.25,">> I wish my strategy had beenbetter, because had it been"
1138,01:16:10.25,01:16:10.25,"really good, Russell wouldn't besitting here."
1139,01:16:12.25,01:16:12.25,You don't know how many nightsI spent trying my hardest.
1140,01:16:15.88,01:16:15.88,"""How can I get Russell out ofthis game?"""
1141,01:16:18.25,01:16:18.25,"And what happened was, everytime I went to a Hero, I was,"
1142,01:16:21.12,01:16:21.12,"like, ""I can't believe thesepeople don't want Russell out."""
1143,01:16:23.17,01:16:23.17,"And he's taking them out one byone, and every time I go and try"
1144,01:16:27.25,01:16:27.25,"to do something, they run backto Russell."
1145,01:16:29.42,01:16:29.42,It was crazy.>> So did that strategy work
1146,01:16:31.46,01:16:31.46,for you?>> It didn't work for me.
1147,01:16:34.04,01:16:34.04,It just never panned out.I could never get Heroes on my
1148,01:16:36.46,01:16:36.46,side.>> Okay.
1149,01:16:40.38,01:16:40.38,">> PROBST: Courtney, you're up.>> Well, hello, Villains."
1150,01:16:47.25,01:16:47.25,"Congratulations, especially mytwo Villainesses."
1151,01:16:50.50,01:16:50.50,"Very proud of you both.Parvati, I know you played a,"
1152,01:16:54.21,01:16:54.21,"you know, a good game.I'm really proud of you."
1153,01:16:56.50,01:16:56.50,"Athletic as hell, great.And then there's my girl,"
1154,01:17:00.33,01:17:00.33,"Sandra.You're loyal as hell, and I"
1155,01:17:03.88,01:17:03.88,"think that that's oftenoverlooked, especially in a"
1156,01:17:07.12,01:17:07.12,game like this.And I want to give you an
1157,01:17:09.96,01:17:09.96,"opportunity to defend somethingthat people view as weakness,"
1158,01:17:12.42,01:17:12.42,"when really it's an amazingstrength that you take, and you"
1159,01:17:15.17,01:17:15.17,"took all the way to end ofPearl Islands,  and you took all"
1160,01:17:18.46,01:17:18.46,the way to the end this time.>> It's true.
1161,01:17:21.00,01:17:21.00,"When I pick somebody that I'mgoing to be loyal to, I'm loyal"
1162,01:17:23.67,01:17:23.67,to them till the end.I was loyal to Courtney from the
1163,01:17:26.46,01:17:26.46,"beginning, and she knows that Iprotected her."
1164,01:17:28.88,01:17:28.88,"Every time I heard anything badabout Courtney, I go bananas,"
1165,01:17:32.08,01:17:32.08,"and I was, like, ""Courtney, youain't going nowhere."
1166,01:17:34.54,01:17:34.54,"They ain't doing this to you,nothing."""
1167,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,"If I tell you I got your back,I got your back."
1168,01:17:39.38,01:17:39.38,"And if something is wrong, I'mgonna confront you."
1169,01:17:41.67,01:17:41.67,"I'm looking out for you, youshould be looking out for me,"
1170,01:17:43.67,01:17:43.67,"but if you ain't, we need tosplit."
1171,01:17:45.92,01:17:45.92,That's it.I love you girl.
1172,01:17:48.12,01:17:48.12,">> I love  you,  girl.>> All right."
1173,01:17:50.17,01:17:50.17,>> PROBST: You're good?>> Done.
1174,01:17:52.17,01:17:52.17,">> PROBST: Take a seat.>> Thanks, Jeffrey."
1175,01:17:54.12,01:17:54.12,">> PROBST: J.T., you're up.>> Russell, I guess I ought to"
1176,01:18:01.67,01:18:01.67,"talk to you first, old buddy.Good strategy is getting to the"
1177,01:18:04.25,01:18:04.25,"end of the game, then winningthe game."
1178,01:18:06.29,01:18:06.29,Getting to the end of the gameis half of it.
1179,01:18:08.83,01:18:08.83,The people you voted out-- doyou think you've done well at
1180,01:18:11.17,01:18:11.17,preserving their vote foryourself at the end of the game?
1181,01:18:13.71,01:18:13.71,">> I really, seriously, believethat everybody on the jury is"
1182,01:18:17.25,01:18:17.25,"going to respect my game play,especially this group of people"
1183,01:18:21.08,01:18:21.08,that's played the game beforeand knows how hard it is to play
1184,01:18:24.17,01:18:24.17,the game.And I might not get anybody's
1185,01:18:26.21,01:18:26.21,"vote, but I have to stick towhat's going to get me here, and"
1186,01:18:29.58,01:18:29.58,"then hopefully, the jury willrespect the way I played the"
1187,01:18:33.25,01:18:33.25,"game.>> How do you think you've done,"
1188,01:18:35.71,01:18:35.71,"Parvati?>> Um, I think..."
1189,01:18:38.58,01:18:38.58,I love Sandra.I think the difference between
1190,01:18:41.83,01:18:41.83,our game was that I was a hugethreat from day one.
1191,01:18:45.58,01:18:45.58,"Sandra was kind of a sleeper.Like, she gave 50, 60% in the"
1192,01:18:49.83,01:18:49.83,"challenges.So post-merge, no one thought"
1193,01:18:52.17,01:18:52.17,about voting Sandra off.I  had  to work in those
1194,01:18:54.62,01:18:54.62,"challenges, because everyone wastrying to vote me out."
1195,01:18:56.54,01:18:56.54,">> Sandra, did you only give 50or 60% of the challenges?"
1196,01:19:02.17,01:19:02.17,">> No, no.No. Here's the deal."
1197,01:19:04.17,01:19:04.17,"When it came to the challenges,I gave 110%, but I'm not a"
1198,01:19:07.00,01:19:07.00,"physical person, right?But..."
1199,01:19:10.25,01:19:10.25,>> I know that.>> And you know what I want to
1200,01:19:12.08,01:19:12.08,"tell you, too?I wish I would have known that"
1201,01:19:14.67,01:19:14.67,"you were going to throw thatthing in his bag, 'cause if I"
1202,01:19:17.25,01:19:17.25,"could have intercepted thatthing, I would have threw it"
1203,01:19:19.54,01:19:19.54,"right back to you, and told you,""Don't do this."
1204,01:19:21.54,01:19:21.54,"You don't know what you'redoing."""
1205,01:19:23.54,01:19:23.54,">> Me, too.>> I mean, I wish..."
1206,01:19:25.54,01:19:25.54,>> I'm not sour about me goingout of the game.
1207,01:19:27.54,01:19:27.54,"I made my bed, I can lay in it.Russell, I shook your hand"
1208,01:19:29.54,01:19:29.54,"before I left that night.I'm not out for vengeance, so"
1209,01:19:31.54,01:19:31.54,"so let's be clear on that.>> Yeah, that's what I'm hoping"
1210,01:19:33.75,01:19:33.75,"for.No matter what happens today, I"
1211,01:19:35.79,01:19:35.79,"sit here, and everybody looks atme like I'm the devil."
1212,01:19:38.08,01:19:38.08,"You know, I am playing the game,and I'm playing it hard."
1213,01:19:41.00,01:19:41.00,">> Hey, I'm laying in my bed,partner."
1214,01:19:43.00,01:19:43.00,Lay in yours.>> But I want to be able to...
1215,01:19:45.00,01:19:45.00,>> Lay in your bed like I'mlaying in mine...
1216,01:19:47.00,01:19:47.00,">> Yeah, but what I want to dois, you know, be cool"
1217,01:19:49.00,01:19:49.00,afterwards.>> Are you through saying...?
1218,01:19:51.00,01:19:51.00,Thank y'all.>> Thank you.
1219,01:19:52.42,01:19:52.42,">> PROBST: Danielle, you're up.>> Well, well, well, Villains,"
1220,01:19:55.25,01:19:55.25,"Hello! Hello!Um, congrats to all three of you"
1221,01:19:57.88,01:19:57.88,"guys.Russell, it's clear that there's"
1222,01:20:02.25,01:20:02.25,been a lack of skill in yourjury management.
1223,01:20:04.71,01:20:04.71,"That being said, what you'veheard from all of these people"
1224,01:20:07.04,01:20:07.04,thus far-- would you changeanything about your game now?
1225,01:20:10.58,01:20:10.58,">> You know, I don't regretanything that I played, 'cause"
1226,01:20:13.38,01:20:13.38,"if I don't play like that,there's no way I'd be here."
1227,01:20:17.12,01:20:17.12,"If that's what you want me tosay, I'm not gonna say that."
1228,01:20:20.04,01:20:20.04,>> No. Would you changeanything?
1229,01:20:22.04,01:20:22.04,>> I'm not going to sit here andtell you what you want to hear.
1230,01:20:25.12,01:20:25.12,"I'm going to tell you what...the truth, and I wouldn't"
1231,01:20:27.17,01:20:27.17,change.>> But after hearing what all of
1232,01:20:29.29,01:20:29.29,"these people have said, howyou..."
1233,01:20:31.29,01:20:31.29,You're not going to get anyvotes!
1234,01:20:33.29,01:20:33.29,"Nobody respects the way that youplayed the game, Russell."
1235,01:20:35.29,01:20:35.29,">> I wouldn't change anything,and I don't regret it."
1236,01:20:37.71,01:20:37.71,>> Okay.That's too bad.
1237,01:20:43.17,01:20:43.17,">> PROBST: Thanks, Danielle.Jerri."
1238,01:20:48.33,01:20:48.33,>> Hi.(laughs)
1239,01:20:50.33,01:20:50.33,I am absolutely 100% undecidedwho to vote for.
1240,01:20:56.42,01:20:56.42,"Absolutely 100%.So I'm going to start with you,"
1241,01:20:58.96,01:20:58.96,Russell.Right after you win the
1242,01:21:01.21,01:21:01.21,"immunity necklace, the plan was,get rid of Parvati and take me"
1243,01:21:04.50,01:21:04.50,to the end.So carry on from that moment and
1244,01:21:08.08,01:21:08.08,"tell me what happened.>> You know, uh, right after I"
1245,01:21:10.75,01:21:10.75,"won the immunity necklace, thatwas the plan."
1246,01:21:14.33,01:21:14.33,"And all day, I thought about it,and I thought that it would be a"
1247,01:21:18.21,01:21:18.21,"bad strategic move by me to takeyou, because you didn't do"
1248,01:21:22.12,01:21:22.12,"anything to anybody on the jury,and if you were sitting next to"
1249,01:21:25.17,01:21:25.17,"me, in my mind, you would havewon."
1250,01:21:27.58,01:21:27.58,>> Can I tell you what he toldme?
1251,01:21:30.12,01:21:30.12,">> And... yeah, I was just goingto say, Parvati, your story?"
1252,01:21:33.38,01:21:33.38,"Because we never talked, so...>> The reason that he told me"
1253,01:21:36.71,01:21:36.71,"that you were leaving is because100%, he knew he was getting"
1254,01:21:39.88,01:21:39.88,"your vote.He wanted you on the jury, 100%."
1255,01:21:42.17,01:21:42.17,He knows he's getting your votetonight.
1256,01:21:44.46,01:21:44.46,>> And it makes sense.>> You know what they say about
1257,01:21:46.75,01:21:46.75,assuming.>> Makes an ass out of you and
1258,01:21:48.75,01:21:48.75,me.>> Exactly.
1259,01:21:50.75,01:21:50.75,"So, uh, Sandra, you know, I hearyou tell everybody how honest"
1260,01:21:53.04,01:21:53.04,"you are with people, and howyou..."
1261,01:21:55.04,01:21:55.04,"When you say you're looking outfor somebody, you look out for"
1262,01:21:57.83,01:21:57.83,"them, but I still gotblindsided, so you didn't really"
1263,01:22:01.54,01:22:01.54,do that for me.It's tough.
1264,01:22:04.04,01:22:04.04,"I got to say, it is a toughdecision."
1265,01:22:06.62,01:22:06.62,"But, um, I appreciate theinsights."
1266,01:22:10.04,01:22:10.04,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Candice, you're up."
1267,01:22:18.17,01:22:18.17,">> Congratulations, Final Three,for making it here."
1268,01:22:22.42,01:22:22.42,"Russell, you know, you have totell lies in this game, but you"
1269,01:22:26.08,01:22:26.08,can go too far.You told dirty lies-- lies that
1270,01:22:31.17,01:22:31.17,you didn't need to tell.And you hurt people doing that.
1271,01:22:35.21,01:22:35.21,"Parvati, you kind of played thisgame under Russell's thumb the"
1272,01:22:39.79,01:22:39.79,"whole time, like a spouse in abad, abusive relationship, you"
1273,01:22:44.92,01:22:44.92,"know, and you never got out ofit."
1274,01:22:48.25,01:22:48.25,"I wanted you to get out.I wanted it so bad for you, but"
1275,01:22:51.04,01:22:51.04,"you never did.I like you, but I can't support"
1276,01:22:53.71,01:22:53.71,"that.As tough as this game is, it"
1277,01:22:57.08,01:22:57.08,really comes down to how youtreat people.
1278,01:23:00.08,01:23:00.08,That's what I'm basing my voteon.
1279,01:23:02.83,01:23:02.83,It's not just what you standfor.
1280,01:23:05.29,01:23:05.29,"It's what you fall for, too.>> PROBST: Thanks, Candice."
1281,01:23:08.62,01:23:08.62,"All right, Rupert, you're up.>> Russell, I want to start"
1282,01:23:16.12,01:23:16.12,with you.To be honest in this game is a
1283,01:23:20.17,01:23:20.17,"very hard thing.To be a manipulative, deceiving,"
1284,01:23:25.71,01:23:25.71,lying person is very easy.You took the easy way out.
1285,01:23:32.33,01:23:32.33,"And if you think you should beproud of how you got here,"
1286,01:23:35.88,01:23:35.88,"you're sadly mistaken.Sandra, sitting here listening"
1287,01:23:41.08,01:23:41.08,to your answers makes me feeleven worse about my game play.
1288,01:23:45.17,01:23:45.17,"I wish you and I had talkedmore, but I had been swayed by"
1289,01:23:50.29,01:23:50.29,what I consider a disgustinghuman being.
1290,01:23:55.83,01:23:55.83,"You opened the door up for us,and we kept slamming it in your"
1291,01:23:59.42,01:23:59.42,"face.I want to say thank you, for all"
1292,01:24:02.17,01:24:02.17,the Heroes.Whether they give you their vote
