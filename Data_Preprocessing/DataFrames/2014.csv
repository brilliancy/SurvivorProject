42,00:02:33.79,00:02:33.79,"last Tribal Council, but she wasn't the one who needed"
43,00:02:36.12,00:02:36.12,"protection. Rupert, the tribe has spoken."

51,00:03:01.96,00:03:01.96,honorable decision was his undoing.

219,00:13:02.21,00:13:02.21,out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins
220,00:13:06.38,00:13:06.38,immunity and a one-in-four shot at the million dollars.
221,00:13:10.25,00:13:10.25,We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.
222,00:13:17.08,00:13:17.08,"All right, here we go. Put your arm up on the ball,"
223,00:13:20.88,00:13:20.88,everybody. First plate is the large plate.
224,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,Let's get used to it for a second.
225,00:13:31.04,00:13:31.04,"This is all about concentration. Three, two, one."
226,00:13:38.38,00:13:38.38,"All right, let's put a large bowl on there."
227,00:13:43.71,00:13:43.71,"Three, two, one. We're locked in."
228,00:13:51.33,00:13:51.33,"All right, let's add another large plate."
229,00:13:56.79,00:13:56.79,"Three, two, one. That sun is out."
230,00:14:03.71,00:14:03.71,It's early and it's already hot. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
231,00:14:27.08,00:14:27.08,You are now stacked nine dishes high.
232,00:14:31.50,00:14:31.50,Sandra wobbling a little bit. Jerri starting to wobble a
233,00:14:35.75,00:14:35.75,little bit. Sandra-- first person out of
234,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,this challenge. Take a spot on the bench.
235,00:14:46.88,00:14:46.88,We are down to four. The next dish you're going to
236,00:14:50.17,00:14:50.17,"add is a small plate. Three, two, one."
237,00:14:57.92,00:14:57.92,Everybody's good. Jerri wobbling.
238,00:15:07.04,00:15:07.04,Get it back under control. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
239,00:15:16.75,00:15:16.75,You have 14 different dishes stacked right now.
240,00:15:22.54,00:15:22.54,Jerri once again unstable. (Jerri gasps)
241,00:15:33.33,00:15:33.33,Jerri can't hold it any longer. Jerri is the second person out
242,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,of this challenge. We are now down to three.
243,00:15:41.58,00:15:41.58,"Russell, Parvati, Colby. All right, it's time to add"
244,00:15:47.12,00:15:47.12,another soy dish. This will be the 15th plate on
245,00:15:52.17,00:15:52.17,"your stack. Three, two, one."
246,00:15:58.17,00:15:58.17,Everybody good. Nice job.
247,00:16:03.71,00:16:03.71,Time to add another dish. You're going to add a medium
248,00:16:08.17,00:16:08.17,bowl. Here we go.
249,00:16:14.04,00:16:14.04,">> Wow. >> PROBST: Three, two, one."
250,00:16:23.00,00:16:23.00,Russell with a bit of a waver. Russell wobbling.
251,00:16:32.54,00:16:32.54,Russell can do nothing but watch his plates fall.
252,00:16:36.08,00:16:36.08,"Russell is out of the challenge, and we are now down to two--"
253,00:16:40.58,00:16:40.58,Parvati and Colby-- for immunity and a one-in-four shot.
254,00:16:46.75,00:16:46.75,Wind coming up. Big gust of wind.
255,00:16:51.42,00:16:51.42,Hang tight. Colby starting to wobble a bit
256,00:17:03.25,00:17:03.25,"but getting it back. Whatever it takes, keep running"
257,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,it in your head. Keep reminding yourself what
258,00:17:10.38,00:17:10.38,you're doing. Do not drift.
259,00:17:16.62,00:17:16.62,Time to add another dish. You're going to add a large
260,00:17:19.33,00:17:19.33,bowl. Take your time.
261,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,Finding it. Don't rush.
262,00:17:25.21,00:17:25.21,I'll give you plenty of time to get there.
263,00:17:30.12,00:17:30.12,"Colby has his bowl, places it in, and it's wobbling."
264,00:17:33.50,00:17:33.50,"Parvati has hers, trying to set it in."
265,00:17:36.88,00:17:36.88,"Get it level, get it how you want it."
266,00:17:40.00,00:17:40.00,"Three, two, one. And we're good."
267,00:17:53.25,00:17:53.25,"You now have 17 dishes stacked. Without warning, Colby's plates"
268,00:18:08.21,00:18:08.21,drop. Parvati wins her second immunity
269,00:18:11.38,00:18:11.38,"challenge in a row. >> Good job, guys."
270,00:18:15.12,00:18:15.12,>> Yeah. Dang.
271,00:18:17.33,00:18:17.33,">> PROBST: Parvati, come on over."
272,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,Congratulations once again. Parvati safe tonight at Tribal
273,00:18:27.46,00:18:27.46,"Council, guaranteed a spot in the final four."
274,00:18:30.79,00:18:30.79,"Colby, Sandra, Jerri, Russell, it has been 37 long days in"
275,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,"Heroes vs. Villains. For one of you, that's as far as"
276,00:18:40.62,00:18:40.62,you go. Somebody going home tonight.
277,00:18:42.21,00:18:42.21,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
278,00:18:44.12,00:18:44.12,I'll see you at Tribal. Congratulations.
279,00:18:45.88,00:18:45.88,>> Thanks. >> Once again Parvati escapes
280,00:18:48.54,00:18:48.54,"her elimination vote. I mean, it's unbelievable how"
281,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,this game works sometimes. It's not like it's the end of
282,00:18:55.12,00:18:55.12,the world. We still have one more person
283,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,"that we can get rid of, that being Colby, but, you know, it's"
284,00:19:03.21,00:19:03.21,"still Survivor, and anything can happen."
285,00:19:22.71,00:19:22.71,>> Winning today is a huge deal for me because I am safe and I
286,00:19:27.92,00:19:27.92,can keep the rest of my Villains here.
287,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"If Colby had won the challenge, it would have been insanity here"
288,00:19:35.38,00:19:35.38,today and I would have had to make a decision that I didn't
289,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,"want to make right now. >> Guys, can I just say..."
290,00:19:44.75,00:19:44.75,(Colby sighs) I made my play yesterday to
291,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,break you guys up. It didn't work.
292,00:19:51.46,00:19:51.46,"I had my opportunity today to win immunity, and damn you, I"
293,00:19:55.25,00:19:55.25,couldn't get it done. (Parvati laughs)
294,00:19:57.62,00:19:57.62,Let's enjoy day 37. I'm proud to be the last Hero
295,00:20:01.67,00:20:01.67,"standing, but I'm not going to hustle today, I'm not going to"
296,00:20:04.38,00:20:04.38,scramble. I have enjoyed playing with you
297,00:20:07.21,00:20:07.21,"guys, I really have. I needed to win today's immunity"
298,00:20:11.42,00:20:11.42,"challenge and I didn't. I've tried, I've tried."
299,00:20:13.46,00:20:13.46,"I really needed that one. So we came back into camp, I"
300,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,"gathered all the Villains, and I gave them my surrender speech."
301,00:20:21.17,00:20:21.17,>> You make me sad. >> You made me cry.
302,00:20:24.17,00:20:24.17,">> Oh, come on. See, that's actually my last"
303,00:20:26.38,00:20:26.38,attempt... (Jerri and Parvati laugh)
304,00:20:28.50,00:20:28.50,...is the sympathy vote. If I can't beat you in the
305,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,"challenges, maybe I'll get an ""Aw, shucks"" vote."
306,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,">> It's good. >> ""Aw, shucks, he's so"
307,00:20:37.25,00:20:37.25,"pathetic, let's keep him around one more day."""
308,00:20:39.92,00:20:39.92,">> Aw! >> Pretty good speech, actually."
309,00:20:44.25,00:20:44.25,"Hell, I almost convinced myself I was giving up, but I don't"
310,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,know how to quit. It's just not in me.
311,00:20:51.08,00:20:51.08,I've never quit anything in my life.
312,00:21:11.46,00:21:11.46,So when the time was right... (exhales)
313,00:21:18.04,00:21:18.04,I made one more attempt. So what are your thoughts?
314,00:21:37.12,00:21:37.12,Send me home? Yeah.
315,00:21:41.46,00:21:41.46,So the idea is to get rid of me and then hopefully get rid of
316,00:21:44.58,00:21:44.58,Parvati tomorrow and take Sandra in?
317,00:21:46.62,00:21:46.62,">> That's the idea, but... >> Right."
318,00:21:50.62,00:21:50.62,"Well, my case is: get rid of Sandra tonight, then the three"
319,00:21:55.71,00:21:55.71,of us have a better shot at beating Parvati tomorrow.
320,00:21:59.38,00:21:59.38,>> Colby comes back from the immunity challenge and he's
321,00:22:02.08,00:22:02.08,"basically quitting. Then, 30 minutes later, he comes"
322,00:22:05.29,00:22:05.29,"up to me telling me, ""Hey, man, I think I still can help you."""
323,00:22:09.71,00:22:09.71,">> Yeah, I think Parvati is going to get a ton of votes,"
324,00:22:11.96,00:22:11.96,especially if she keeps winning like this.
325,00:22:14.04,00:22:14.04,I haven't had a chance to talk to Jerri yet.
326,00:22:16.50,00:22:16.50,>> I got Jerri. Trust me.
327,00:22:22.38,00:22:22.38,Tonight's Tribal Council is going to be very interesting
328,00:22:25.88,00:22:25.88,"because you think about it, it might be the best strategic move"
329,00:22:29.21,00:22:29.21,to keep Colby and to get rid of Sandra.
330,00:22:36.12,00:22:36.12,"You know, I don't trust Sandra as far as I can throw her."
331,00:22:40.88,00:22:40.88,"We keep Colby, it helps us beat Parvati."
332,00:22:44.21,00:22:44.21,The problem with keeping Colby is he could possibly go to the
333,00:22:47.17,00:22:47.17,"top three, and that's it-- my game's over."
334,00:22:53.42,00:22:53.42,I don't know what to do this time.
335,00:22:56.42,00:22:56.42,"I've got to think: what is the best option for me, only me?"
336,00:23:01.21,00:23:01.21,"I'm going to wait till Tribal Council, see what they have to"
337,00:23:04.21,00:23:04.21,"say, and make my decision right there."
338,00:23:27.92,00:23:27.92,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
339,00:23:33.33,00:23:33.33,"Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda, Candice, Danielle, and Rupert,"
340,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
341,00:23:48.50,00:23:48.50,"Colby, the last remaining Hero. Third time you played the game,"
342,00:23:53.08,00:23:53.08,it seems like it's been the toughest.
343,00:23:56.42,00:23:56.42,">> The toughest out of the three, but also just the"
344,00:23:58.42,00:23:58.42,toughest journey to get here. The challenges have been the
345,00:24:00.75,00:24:00.75,"biggest disappointment, bar none."
346,00:24:03.08,00:24:03.08,I needed this immunity more than any of them.
347,00:24:05.96,00:24:05.96,Didn't work out. Parvati's a heck of a
348,00:24:08.38,00:24:08.38,"competitor, and if I had won immunity today, she might be"
349,00:24:11.12,00:24:11.12,"going home tonight. >> PROBST: So, Colby, it would"
350,00:24:14.38,00:24:14.38,seem like there are four Villains who could easily just
351,00:24:17.25,00:24:17.25,"say, ""Let's just stay with the plan, get rid of Colby, and then"
352,00:24:20.42,00:24:20.42,"we'll figure out what to do tomorrow."""
353,00:24:23.04,00:24:23.04,">> Right. >> PROBST: On the flip side, if"
354,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,"there is a big move to be made, tonight would be a great time"
355,00:24:28.21,00:24:28.21,"to do it. >> Yeah, there's hope."
356,00:24:31.96,00:24:31.96,"And I've been hustling. Trying to convince Russell,"
357,00:24:36.54,00:24:36.54,"specifically, to take me and not Sandra, and that's a tough sell."
358,00:24:40.88,00:24:40.88,Would have been easier if Sandra had won immunity today.
359,00:24:44.25,00:24:44.25,>> PROBST: You mean easier to get rid of Parvati?
360,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,">> Yeah, because nobody really wants to sit next to Parvati in"
361,00:24:48.79,00:24:48.79,"the finals. I love you to death, Sandra, but"
362,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,everybody wants to sit next to you.
363,00:24:53.29,00:24:53.29,">> Well, that's news to me. Then I should be smiling."
364,00:24:56.58,00:24:56.58,"I shouldn't have packed, huh? >> PROBST: If it's true."
365,00:24:59.92,00:24:59.92,That's the rub. If it's true.
366,00:25:02.29,00:25:02.29,">> No, you're good. I mean, say what you got to say."
367,00:25:05.38,00:25:05.38,">> PROBST: So, Sandra, how much of what you hear around camp do"
368,00:25:08.92,00:25:08.92,you believe at this point? >> This is  Survivor.
369,00:25:11.29,00:25:11.29,"You can't believe nobody. >> PROBST: Parvati, you've been"
370,00:25:13.58,00:25:13.58,in this game with three of these people from one.
371,00:25:16.83,00:25:16.83,"Yet, the ability to say, ""Yes, I believe you, 100%."""
372,00:25:20.75,00:25:20.75,">> No. No way. I mean, not since day one and"
373,00:25:25.46,00:25:25.46,not today. And listening to Colby say that
374,00:25:28.83,00:25:28.83,"it would be much easier for him if I didn't have this necklace,"
375,00:25:32.04,00:25:32.04,and I would be going home tonight...
376,00:25:34.58,00:25:34.58,"I'm, like, ""That's news to me, because..."""
377,00:25:36.88,00:25:36.88,">> I said, there's a chance. >> I mean, I've been promised"
378,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,"the moon, the stars, the sun, the sky, everything."
379,00:25:41.83,00:25:41.83,"You know, we'll see what happens."
380,00:25:44.29,00:25:44.29,"But I don't believe anyone. >> PROBST: Russell, anybody here"
381,00:25:48.25,00:25:48.25,"you believe 100%, there's no chance they would lie to you?"
382,00:25:51.92,00:25:51.92,>> You just got to hope that those true alliances that you
383,00:25:55.58,00:25:55.58,thought you had and that you tried to build at the beginning
384,00:26:01.25,00:26:01.25,"help you at the end. But you know, sometimes it just"
385,00:26:05.75,00:26:05.75,"doesn't work out that way. >> PROBST: And Colby, that"
386,00:26:08.92,00:26:08.92,inability of the Villains to trust each other is exactly
387,00:26:12.00,00:26:12.00,"where your hope lies. >> Yeah, and you know, so many"
388,00:26:16.54,00:26:16.54,"nights and so many different days since we merged, the"
389,00:26:20.46,00:26:20.46,"Villains run through these implosions, you know, where the"
390,00:26:23.96,00:26:23.96,conflict starts. And that's what you want.
391,00:26:28.62,00:26:28.62,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to find out where the loyalties"
392,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,lie. Parvati has the necklace.
393,00:26:34.12,00:26:34.12,You cannot vote for her. Anybody else is fair game.
394,00:26:36.58,00:26:36.58,"It's time to vote. Parvati, you're up."
395,00:27:02.58,00:27:02.58,">> Well, Colby, today's your day to go home, so, adios."
396,00:27:19.92,00:27:19.92,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
397,00:27:31.88,00:27:31.88,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
398,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
399,00:27:36.25,00:27:36.25,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
400,00:27:41.50,00:27:41.50,First vote-- Colby. Sandra.
401,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,"One vote-- Colby, one vote-- Sandra."
402,00:27:54.42,00:27:54.42,"Colby. Two votes-- Colby, one vote--"
403,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,Sandra. 16th person voted out and
404,00:28:05.21,00:28:05.21,the eighth member of our jury-- Colby.
405,00:28:07.50,00:28:07.50,That's three. That's enough.
406,00:28:09.50,00:28:09.50,"You need to bring me your torch. Colby, the tribe has spoken."
407,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,Time for you to go. Congratulations on making it to
408,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,the final four. Tomorrow you'll compete in your
409,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,final immunity challenge. I encourage you-- try to get a
410,00:28:44.04,00:28:44.04,good night's sleep. You're going to need it.
411,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
412,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,Good night. >> I know if I had won that
413,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,"challenge today, I'd have a shot at a million dollars."
414,00:29:01.42,00:29:01.42,"It's disappointing, especially when the challenges were"
415,00:29:04.25,00:29:04.25,something that I used to be good at.
416,00:29:06.88,00:29:06.88,"I guess I'm just an old, dusty veteran."
417,00:29:10.71,00:29:10.71,"My third time in, I'm just not destined to win this game."
418,00:29:26.75,00:29:26.75,>> Finally! >> Oh!
419,00:29:28.79,00:29:28.79,>> Unbelievable. >> I can't believe it.
420,00:29:31.12,00:29:31.12,>> When Rupert looked like a crazy serial killer...
421,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,>> Yeah. >> ...I thought he was going to
422,00:29:36.67,00:29:36.67,"lunge over and kill someone. >> Yeah, he just looked like a"
423,00:29:39.42,00:29:39.42,lunatic. >> He  is  a lunatic.
424,00:29:41.50,00:29:41.50,>> So what? He wrote my name down.
425,00:29:43.54,00:29:43.54,I don't care. (Jerri laughs)
426,00:29:45.54,00:29:45.54,"Just like Colby wrote my name down two times, too."
427,00:29:49.08,00:29:49.08,>> Tonight at Tribal when Colby said that it would have been
428,00:29:51.42,00:29:51.42,"easier to get rid of me, it was kind of an eye opener for me."
429,00:29:57.29,00:29:57.29,"I didn't realize that I was such a huge threat, like, with the"
430,00:30:00.92,00:30:00.92,jury. So now I feel like I really have
431,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,"to try extra hard to win this immunity, to make sure that I'm"
432,00:30:06.54,00:30:06.54,sitting there in the final three.
433,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,">> She went to the well. We have to win, Russell."
434,00:30:22.83,00:30:22.83,>> We have to win. >> Yup.
435,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,>> I know. I know it. I need to beat Parvati.
436,00:30:35.42,00:30:35.42,She has really proven to me that she is a really tough
437,00:30:38.04,00:30:38.04,"competitor. >> Yeah, I know."
438,00:30:53.21,00:30:53.21,>> Well... >> Like a nice little birdie.
439,00:30:55.25,00:30:55.25,"It's a fairly tough decision now, because my main alliance is"
440,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,"Parvati, and I'm leaning towards sending Parvati home."
441,00:31:01.92,00:31:01.92,>> Guess what I have. >> Get out of here!
442,00:31:03.92,00:31:03.92,>> It better not be a map. >> Believe it.
443,00:31:06.04,00:31:06.04,>> It kind of looks like a map! >> It's a map.
444,00:31:08.58,00:31:08.58,">> I don't know. >> Oh, my gosh!"
445,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,"(screaming happily) >> All right, read."
446,00:31:16.25,00:31:16.25,">> Okay. ""Congratulations, Final Four."""
447,00:31:19.21,00:31:19.21,">> Yay! >> ""You are almost at the end."
448,00:31:24.21,00:31:24.21,Follow the map to the ceremonial beach.
449,00:31:26.38,00:31:26.38,There you'll find the torches of your fallen comrades.
450,00:31:29.46,00:31:29.46,"At each torch, you will collect a representative mask of those"
451,00:31:32.17,00:31:32.17,"who were voted out before you. At the end of your journey,"
452,00:31:35.50,00:31:35.50,"you'll offer them up to the burning man, paying respect to"
453,00:31:38.04,00:31:38.04,"their memory, as they each had a part in getting you to this"
454,00:31:41.17,00:31:41.17,point. You'll then proceed to your
455,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,"final immunity challenge."" The rites of passage-- it's"
456,00:31:55.71,00:31:55.71,where you pay tribute to your fallen comrades.
457,00:31:58.12,00:31:58.12,"So it's really nice, because this has been the hardest game"
458,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"I've ever played in my life, and it's because of the people that"
459,00:32:05.96,00:32:05.96,I played with. Everyone fought to play this
460,00:32:09.75,00:32:09.75,"game as hard as they could, so I'm ready to pay my respects."
461,00:32:13.96,00:32:13.96,They deserve it. >> Sugar!
462,00:32:20.54,00:32:20.54,">> Oh, Sugar. >> Well, I definitely have more"
463,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,faith in myself this trip than the last time I played Survivor.
464,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,That's the hardest thing about this game.
465,00:32:32.21,00:32:32.21,You can't play with your heart all the time.
466,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,You have to play with your head. You can't win this game playing
467,00:32:37.58,00:32:37.58,good all the time. You just can't.
468,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,I proved that. >> Stephenie!
469,00:32:46.25,00:32:46.25,">> Stephenie. She was hard core, too."
470,00:32:48.29,00:32:48.29,">> Yeah, I was kind of shocked that she went out second, she"
471,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,was such a tough competitor. >> Yeah.
472,00:32:53.17,00:32:53.17,>> Yeah. >> I did get hurt on the first
473,00:32:55.71,00:32:55.71,"day, but it's a part of the game."
474,00:32:59.25,00:32:59.25,"I can live with it. I mean, I definitely think"
475,00:33:01.38,00:33:01.38,people were gunning for me because I had such a reputation
476,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,for being such a strong competitor.
477,00:33:06.08,00:33:06.08,My reputation was probably one of my hardest things to
478,00:33:09.08,00:33:09.08,"overcome. >> Oh, Randy!"
479,00:33:18.62,00:33:18.62,Randy-- every morning made me smile and laugh.
480,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,He was a good friend to me. >> My lack of ability to
481,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,"communicate with 26-year-old girls is what got me booted,"
482,00:33:31.38,00:33:31.38,ultimately. And I'm not ashamed of that.
483,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,What phases me is having people clearly stupider than me
484,00:33:38.88,00:33:38.88,"controlling my fate, and there's nothing I can do about it."
485,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,>> Cirie. >> She was vicious in the
486,00:33:50.25,00:33:50.25,challenges. (laughter)
487,00:33:52.25,00:33:52.25,>> People underestimate Cirie as a physical competitor.
488,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,She's really tough. >> I attempted to play different
489,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,"this time, but I felt like I wasn't given a chance."
490,00:34:03.04,00:34:03.04,"I feel like people came in, you know, with ""We got to get her."
491,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,"She's a schemer,"" just straight out."
492,00:34:07.46,00:34:07.46,You don't even know if that was the game I was going to play
493,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,"this time. You know, so never judge a book"
494,00:34:13.58,00:34:13.58,"by its cover. >> Oh, Tom."
495,00:34:23.04,00:34:23.04,>> He seemed like a real trustworthy person.
496,00:34:25.08,00:34:25.08,">> He was the first winner to go, too."
497,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,What a shame. >> The fact that you can be the
498,00:34:30.96,00:34:30.96,winner and dominate one season and be the cast-aside who gets
499,00:34:36.88,00:34:36.88,dropped for a guy who's jumping around on one foot in your next
500,00:34:40.58,00:34:40.58,season I think is what makes the game special and what made it
501,00:34:45.21,00:34:45.21,worth playing. >> Tyson!
502,00:34:55.79,00:34:55.79,>> Oh! He had such a sense of humor.
503,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,>> The funny guy. >> When you play with these
504,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,"all-stars, everybody's just out for blood immediately."
505,00:35:03.08,00:35:03.08,I was in control until I made a stupid move.
506,00:35:05.92,00:35:05.92,I was basically the victim of my own stupidity.
507,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,"America thinks I'm an idiot, but as far as I'm concerned,"
508,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,I'm still the winner. >> Careful.
509,00:35:26.00,00:35:26.00,">> James! Seriously, what a competitor,"
510,00:35:28.88,00:35:28.88,"though. I mean, he hurt his knee and he"
511,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,still competed in the next two challenges.
512,00:35:32.79,00:35:32.79,">> When the big guys fall, they fall hard."
513,00:35:36.67,00:35:36.67,>> This time I actually tried to be a little more conversational
514,00:35:39.50,00:35:39.50,with with people. I talked more.
515,00:35:41.08,00:35:41.08,"I was more friendly, I guess. There was this injury, and"
516,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,"something you have to deal with. I had a great time, but an"
517,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,"injury got me in the end again. >> So, Rob."
518,00:35:56.58,00:35:56.58,">> Boston Rob. >> Rob, if you ain't with me,"
519,00:35:59.96,00:35:59.96,you against me. >> Boston Rob!
520,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,">> Too bad, too bad the poor old guy didn't be who he was"
521,00:36:05.17,00:36:05.17,messing with. (Jerri laughs)
522,00:36:07.96,00:36:07.96,>> Leave him alone! >> He did do a lot for morale in
523,00:36:10.25,00:36:10.25,the beginning. >> Yeah.
524,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,">> Yeah. >> He told me one time, he said,"
525,00:36:13.92,00:36:13.92,"""Me and you, we're going to get along 'cause Puerto Ricans and"
526,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,"Italians are loud and ignorant,"" and I died laughing."
527,00:36:20.79,00:36:20.79,">> When I first played this game, I was 25 years old."
528,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"I'm 33 now, and I can still hang in there with the young guys."
529,00:36:28.62,00:36:28.62,"I can still do it, but, you know, at one point I passed out,"
530,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,"but I came through all right. You know, the new generation of"
531,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,players are smarter now. I got to applaud them for
532,00:36:39.75,00:36:39.75,getting rid of me. It's the first smart thing
533,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,they've done in 20 seasons. They're starting to learn.
534,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,">> Careful. >> Oh, Coach."
535,00:36:56.46,00:36:56.46,">> Oh, no, it's Coach. >> Benji."
536,00:36:58.71,00:36:58.71,>> Coach Potato. >> Your lover boy.
537,00:37:01.12,00:37:01.12,>> Oh... you guys. >> Jerri's boyfriend.
538,00:37:04.38,00:37:04.38,>> He was my partner in crime there for a little while and we
539,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,"had some really good talks. See, I can pay homage to you,"
540,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,Coach. >> Namaste.
541,00:37:13.96,00:37:13.96,">> Namaste. >> I know, among all of the"
542,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,"survivors that people have hated to hate, loved to hate, and"
543,00:37:22.38,00:37:22.38,"hated to love, I was and am number one on the hit list, and"
544,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,I'm proud of that fact. Inspiring other people but at
545,00:37:32.12,00:37:32.12,"the same time making myself a better man, and through all of"
546,00:37:35.58,00:37:35.58,"that myriad of experiences, I found redemption."
547,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,>> Courtney. >> Courtney.
548,00:37:47.62,00:37:47.62,">> Oh, little one. >> I miss you, Courtney."
549,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,">> Usually, on a regular season, you get a bunch of duds."
550,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,This time there were just no pawns here.
551,00:37:57.96,00:37:57.96,"It was-- everyone was the master of the chess board, and they"
552,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,were all playing a different game.
553,00:38:02.88,00:38:02.88,So I sum up the experience as: I'm really glad I came and did
554,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,"it. I did the best I could, and, you"
555,00:38:08.62,00:38:08.62,"know, getting on the jury on an All-Stars,  that's not that"
556,00:38:11.29,00:38:11.29,"easy. >> Oh, J.T."
557,00:38:17.08,00:38:17.08,You know what? You never would have known that
558,00:38:18.67,00:38:18.67,"a Hero helped a Villain make their biggest move of the game,"
559,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,giving him his hidden immunity idol.
560,00:38:26.79,00:38:26.79,">> He was the second winner to go, too."
561,00:38:28.75,00:38:28.75,>> Poor J.T. >> Never give your heart to a
562,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,"Villain, J.T. (Jerri laughs)"
563,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,>> I feel like I done really well.
564,00:38:36.29,00:38:36.29,"I just, you know, I made a big move early in the game."
565,00:38:40.21,00:38:40.21,I gave my idol to the biggest Villain in the game-- Russell--
566,00:38:43.54,00:38:43.54,and he used it to vote me out. It was beautiful.
567,00:38:46.79,00:38:46.79,So I would say my experience this time was much more
568,00:38:50.25,00:38:50.25,humbling. >> Amanda.
569,00:38:55.75,00:38:55.75,>> Amanda. >> That was the first time that
570,00:38:59.08,00:38:59.08,girl has ever been voted out of the game of  Survivor.
571,00:39:03.79,00:39:03.79,">> Overall, I'm proud of how I played."
572,00:39:06.04,00:39:06.04,I think my biggest mistake in this game was giving Danielle
573,00:39:08.25,00:39:08.25,back the clue. I should have kept it.
574,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,"That was my lifeline, but my conscience got the best of me."
575,00:39:14.04,00:39:14.04,I am just not destined to win this game.
576,00:39:21.50,00:39:21.50,">> Candice. >> Oh, Candice."
577,00:39:25.04,00:39:25.04,>> I'm glad you got to enjoy those peanut butter and jelly
578,00:39:27.12,00:39:27.12,sandwiches before you went. >> Was it worth a million
579,00:39:29.08,00:39:29.08,"dollars? >> Hell, no."
580,00:39:30.92,00:39:30.92,">> A million-dollar sandwich? >> Hell, no."
581,00:39:34.96,00:39:34.96,">> Making it to the 13th person voted out this time, I think, is"
582,00:39:39.21,00:39:39.21,a much more serious accomplishment than it was last
583,00:39:43.33,00:39:43.33,time because I beat people that were harder to beat this time.
584,00:39:47.25,00:39:47.25,I'll definitely take a few lessons home.
585,00:39:53.38,00:39:53.38,>> Danielle. >> She was my little Boston
586,00:39:56.42,00:39:56.42,brawler. She always stood up for me.
587,00:40:00.25,00:40:00.25,"I miss you, Danielle. >> And I'm sorry, Danielle."
588,00:40:04.21,00:40:04.21,(Parvati laughs) >> I'm not.
589,00:40:06.04,00:40:06.04,>> I am. >> This was the most intense
590,00:40:09.96,00:40:09.96,"thing I've ever had to go through in my life, and I have"
591,00:40:13.04,00:40:13.04,no regrets. I was proud of the way I
592,00:40:15.79,00:40:15.79,"performed in my challenges, and I think I showed that, you know,"
593,00:40:19.88,00:40:19.88,that I have a heart and I am a good person and I'm not a
594,00:40:23.17,00:40:23.17,"Villain. >> Oh, Rupert."
595,00:40:27.04,00:40:27.04,>> Rupert. >> The pirate.
596,00:40:28.88,00:40:28.88,">> He was nice. >> Arr, me fire."
597,00:40:31.33,00:40:31.33,">> Arr, me toe. We hope your toe gets better."
598,00:40:35.42,00:40:35.42,>> To have my torch put out instead of making it to day 39
599,00:40:39.17,00:40:39.17,and being able to sit in the final Tribal Council felt very
600,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,"bad, but I feel very, very good about the way that I played the"
601,00:40:49.67,00:40:49.67,"game and the way that I showed that label of Hero, I deserved"

604,00:41:08.08,00:41:08.08,>> Colby. >> My  Outback  comrade.
605,00:41:10.21,00:41:10.21,">> I think he was the real, true Hero of 'em all."
606,00:41:13.12,00:41:13.12,>> He really is. >> Yeah.
607,00:41:16.92,00:41:16.92,>> I'm almost ten years older than I was the first time I
608,00:41:19.42,00:41:19.42,"played this game. Not as fast, not as strong."
609,00:41:24.58,00:41:24.58,"Yeah, I'm disappointed. I'm frustrated in the fact that"
610,00:41:27.12,00:41:27.12,"I'm out of the game and the game is still going, but I'm proud of"
611,00:41:30.71,00:41:30.71,the way I played. I outlasted all the other
612,00:41:33.17,00:41:33.17,Heroes. >> Cool.
613,00:41:59.67,00:41:59.67,">> Okay, light her up. >> Whoo!"
614,00:42:12.79,00:42:12.79,">> You go, girl. >> Now, that's a fire."

667,00:46:32.17,00:46:32.17,You know which symbols you have. They're hanging around your

737,00:51:08.92,00:51:08.92,do. Russell's thinking I'm his
738,00:51:10.67,00:51:10.67,biggest threat when it comes to jury votes?
739,00:51:13.04,00:51:13.04,"I could be going home. You know, not having that"

745,00:51:41.12,00:51:41.12,Russell won immunity means that Parvati is going home.
746,00:51:47.92,00:51:47.92,"If I watch her torch get snuffed and her walk off, I'm not going"
747,00:51:51.21,00:51:51.21,to cry about it. I'm going to be very happy
748,00:51:53.75,00:51:53.75,about it. >> You know why everybody wants
749,00:52:07.58,00:52:07.58,"to take you to the end? >> 'Cause I already won, and"
750,00:52:09.67,00:52:09.67,they'll win against me? >> Yeah.
751,00:52:11.67,00:52:11.67,">> But I don't care. I'll take the $100,000."
752,00:52:13.79,00:52:13.79,Because I knew I wasn't going to win again.
753,00:52:16.04,00:52:16.04,">> And no matter what, in any circumstances, I'm keeping"
754,00:52:18.08,00:52:18.08,Sandra. I think she might get Courtney's
755,00:52:20.67,00:52:20.67,"vote, and that's it. So I'm going to use Sandra for"
756,00:52:23.96,00:52:23.96,me to win a million dollars. She can't beat me.
757,00:52:31.21,00:52:31.21,>> All right. >> Straight up.
758,00:52:33.17,00:52:33.17,">> I'll take the $100,000. You know how I feel."
759,00:52:35.17,00:52:35.17,>> That's the... It just... It just makes sense to me.
760,00:52:37.54,00:52:37.54,">> Russell won immunity, so essentially, I have to do"
761,00:52:40.88,00:52:40.88,whatever Russell says because he's wearing the idol.
762,00:52:44.17,00:52:44.17,"I'm feeling wonderful because, regardless, Russell's keeping"
763,00:52:47.58,00:52:47.58,me around because I'll never get a single vote.
764,00:52:52.42,00:52:52.42,But I don't know about that. (squeaking)
765,00:53:30.88,00:53:30.88,">> I got to go for a walk, but those might be good."
766,00:53:37.71,00:53:37.71,">> You want her with us? >> Yup, 'cause, uh, Jerri..."
767,00:53:39.71,00:53:39.71,">> Okay, well, let me just... let me just say something before"
768,00:53:42.29,00:53:42.29,"you make that decision, okay? >> Mm-hmm."
769,00:53:44.33,00:53:44.33,">> If Sandra's with us, she instantly gets Amanda, Candice"
770,00:53:48.83,00:53:48.83,and Courtney. >> I don't think so.
771,00:53:52.67,00:53:52.67,"No, I'd rather take Jerri. I mean, I'd rather put Jerri on"
772,00:53:56.12,00:53:56.12,"the jury, 'cause I got her vote. >> What if she doesn't vote for"
773,00:53:59.00,00:53:59.00,you? What if she votes for Sandra?
774,00:54:01.17,00:54:01.17,>> Parvati wants me to get rid of Sandra because she can't even
775,00:54:04.38,00:54:04.38,"beat Sandra. She surely can't beat me, so"
776,00:54:08.21,00:54:08.21,she's trying to find out a way to possibly get second.
777,00:54:12.33,00:54:12.33,It's a scenario that's been through my head over and over
778,00:54:15.42,00:54:15.42,all kind of different ways. Best option for me is to take
779,00:54:18.92,00:54:18.92,"Jerri and Sandra, and that would be the best strategic move for"
780,00:54:21.12,00:54:21.12,me. >> Your best strategic move?
781,00:54:23.12,00:54:23.12,">> Would be Jerri and Sandra. >> No, 'cause Sandra would win."
782,00:54:26.12,00:54:26.12,">> Well, you know, it gives me two people that I could sit"
783,00:54:28.58,00:54:28.58,"there and say, ""Please, ask these people what strategic play"
784,00:54:32.12,00:54:32.12,"that they made in the entire game besides sunbathing."""
785,00:54:35.67,00:54:35.67,"Right now, I'm on the fence, because if I send Jerri home,"
786,00:54:39.50,00:54:39.50,"I'll get her vote. If I send Parvati home, I don't"
787,00:54:43.12,00:54:43.12,"know if I will get her vote, but I might."
788,00:54:47.38,00:54:47.38,Tonight's Tribal Council is extremely a hard decision.
789,00:54:52.38,00:54:52.38,I suffered way too much in this game not to win it.
790,00:54:56.33,00:54:56.33,"I have to win this thing. I mean, we let the chips fall"
791,00:55:04.12,00:55:04.12,where they may. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
792,00:55:22.33,00:55:22.33,"the members of our jury. Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda,"
793,00:55:29.21,00:55:29.21,"Candice, Danielle, Rupert, and and Colby, voted out at the last"
794,00:55:35.25,00:55:35.25,"Tribal Council. So, Jerri, you get back to camp."
795,00:55:42.54,00:55:42.54,You don't have immunity. So not only do you have to think
796,00:55:45.75,00:55:45.75,about who you want to vote out. You have to make sure it's not
797,00:55:48.67,00:55:48.67,you who  is  voted out. How much of your time is spent
798,00:55:51.54,00:55:51.54,"making sure it's not you? >> Well, getting back to camp,"
799,00:55:55.21,00:55:55.21,"you know, normally, I just walk off and go sit by myself on the"
800,00:55:58.46,00:55:58.46,beach and think about things and contemplate everything that's
801,00:56:01.83,00:56:01.83,"going on in the game. But today, I didn't really leave"
802,00:56:05.21,00:56:05.21,camp. I stuck around the whole time.
803,00:56:08.67,00:56:08.67,">> PROBST: Sandra, you get back to camp."
804,00:56:11.00,00:56:11.00,"You don't have immunity, either. >> What do I do?"
805,00:56:14.04,00:56:14.04,"I go to the person with immunity, because they're not"
806,00:56:17.12,00:56:17.12,"going home, and you want to let that person know, this is why"
807,00:56:20.04,00:56:20.04,"you should keep me, and these are the votes..."
808,00:56:22.46,00:56:22.46,"I might possibly get one, if that, so, you know, who better"
809,00:56:26.21,00:56:26.21,to go up against? 'Cause I don't want to go home
810,00:56:28.75,00:56:28.75,in fourth. >> PROBST: So your play to
811,00:56:30.92,00:56:30.92,"Russell was, ""Take me 'cause I can't win."""
812,00:56:33.21,00:56:33.21,">> Yeah, and Russell already knew that."
813,00:56:35.21,00:56:35.21,He tells me all the time. (Jerri laughs)
814,00:56:37.25,00:56:37.25,">> PROBST: That you can't win? >> Yeah. Well, kind of. No?"
815,00:56:39.33,00:56:39.33,>> You never know what's going to happen.
816,00:56:42.08,00:56:42.08,"She could easily, possibly win. This is when the decision-making"
817,00:56:46.88,00:56:46.88,"is, to me, the most important and the hardest."
818,00:56:50.21,00:56:50.21,"You know, alliances are going to get broke tonight."
819,00:56:53.79,00:56:53.79,"And the decision-making is, who do you want to bring that you"
820,00:56:58.17,00:56:58.17,think that you can beat when it comes down to it?
821,00:57:01.21,00:57:01.21,">> Who has friends, who doesn't, who might potentially give you a"
822,00:57:05.04,00:57:05.04,vote. Who definitely won't give you a
823,00:57:07.08,00:57:07.08,vote. You got to sort it out.
824,00:57:09.38,00:57:09.38,You got to write it in the sand. (laughter)
825,00:57:12.62,00:57:12.62,"Do the math. >> PROBST: Parvati, after"
826,00:57:15.96,00:57:15.96,"winning two immunity challenges in a row, you don't win today."
827,00:57:18.79,00:57:18.79,">> I feel vulnerable. I feel very vulnerable,"
828,00:57:20.79,00:57:20.79,"especially knowing that I have played a good, strategic game,"
829,00:57:24.71,00:57:24.71,"and if people are trying to vote out threats, then I'll probably"
830,00:57:27.38,00:57:27.38,be walking out that path tonight.
831,00:57:29.83,00:57:29.83,">> PROBST: Jerri, what case do you make to Russell?"
832,00:57:32.38,00:57:32.38,"Why keep you? >> Well, Parvati's a huge"
833,00:57:34.58,00:57:34.58,"threat. You know, that's a scary thing."
834,00:57:36.96,00:57:36.96,So that's kind of the case I push.
835,00:57:39.25,00:57:39.25,>> PROBST: Why is Parvati a huge threat?
836,00:57:41.54,00:57:41.54,">> 'Cause she's been kicking butt, and she's got a lot of"
837,00:57:44.17,00:57:44.17,"friends over there, and it's... You know, it's no secret."
838,00:57:47.58,00:57:47.58,"Right now, that is a threat. >> PROBST: So, Parvati, Sandra"
839,00:57:51.75,00:57:51.75,"says, ""Take me. I can't win."" Jerri says, ""Get rid of Parvati."
840,00:57:54.38,00:57:54.38,"She  can  win."" What case do you make to"
841,00:57:56.75,00:57:56.75,"Russell? >> I say, if he's going to be"
842,00:58:00.00,00:58:00.00,"loyal to anyone in this game, if he wants to redeem himself..."
843,00:58:05.21,00:58:05.21,"(laughs) ...as far as Villains go, then"
844,00:58:08.25,00:58:08.25,"take me, you know. I've been your girl this whole"
845,00:58:10.29,00:58:10.29,time. I've been protecting you.
846,00:58:12.29,00:58:12.29,I've had your back this whole time.
847,00:58:14.58,00:58:14.58,That's as good as I can get. Is... Was just...
848,00:58:17.12,00:58:17.12,>> You've been protecting me? How have you been protecting me?
849,00:58:19.12,00:58:19.12,>> We've been protecting each other... since day one.
850,00:58:22.92,00:58:22.92,>> Hmm. >> You disagree?
851,00:58:28.25,00:58:28.25,">> Oh, I think I've been protecting you."
852,00:58:30.29,00:58:30.29,>> We've been protecting each other.
853,00:58:33.04,00:58:33.04,"I've never gone against him, which I could have many times,"
854,00:58:36.12,00:58:36.12,"because we argue a lot, you know."
855,00:58:39.04,00:58:39.04,">> PROBST: Now, Russell, Parvati could easily have said, ""You're"
856,00:58:41.08,00:58:41.08,"right, you've been protecting me."""
857,00:58:43.08,00:58:43.08,"She didn't. She looked you in the eye, and"
858,00:58:45.17,00:58:45.17,"she said, ""We've been protecting each other."""
859,00:58:47.25,00:58:47.25,">> It kind of annoys me. >> PROBST: So, Russell,"
860,00:58:51.17,00:58:51.17,completely different experience for you today.
861,00:58:53.54,00:58:53.54,You have the upper hand. You have the power.
862,00:58:56.25,00:58:56.25,>> Everybody has came to me today and told me what they
863,00:58:59.46,00:58:59.46,"were thinking, and every... Everybody made perfect sense."
864,00:59:03.38,00:59:03.38,"You know, everybody's playing strategically today."
865,00:59:07.00,00:59:07.00,>> PROBST: And all three of them are smiling right now.
866,00:59:09.04,00:59:09.04,"(laughter) All right, let's get to it."
867,00:59:15.33,00:59:15.33,Russell has the immunity necklace.
868,00:59:17.33,00:59:17.33,You cannot vote for Russell. He is guaranteed a spot at the
869,00:59:19.92,00:59:19.92,"final Tribal Council. Parvati, Jerri, Sandra, one of"
870,00:59:23.54,00:59:23.54,you is about to be sent home. It is time to vote.
871,00:59:27.92,00:59:27.92,"Parvati, you're up. >> Hopefully, it's you tonight,"
872,00:59:38.25,00:59:38.25,"not me, 'cause I want to win. Sorry."
873,00:59:53.75,00:59:53.75,">> I have mad respect for you, Parvati."
874,00:59:57.00,00:59:57.00,You have shown again that you are capable of kicking some
875,01:00:00.50,01:00:00.50,"serious butt, and for that reason, it is not a good idea to"
876,01:00:04.17,01:00:04.17,sit next to you in the final three.
877,01:00:17.96,01:00:17.96,>> Sorry I had to do this. I trusted you the entire game.
878,01:00:21.62,01:00:21.62,"I believe you would have been loyal to me, but now my best"
879,01:00:24.83,01:00:24.83,shot to win this game is to get rid of you.
880,01:00:35.29,01:00:35.29,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
881,01:00:46.17,01:00:46.17,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
882,01:00:48.46,01:00:48.46,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
883,01:00:50.79,01:00:50.79,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
884,01:00:57.17,01:00:57.17,First vote-- Parvati. Jerri.
885,01:01:06.50,01:01:06.50,"One vote-- Parvati, one vote-- Jerri."
886,01:01:10.46,01:01:10.46,"Jerri. Two votes-- Jerri, one vote--"
887,01:01:13.46,01:01:13.46,Parvati. One vote left.
888,01:01:18.96,01:01:18.96,"Seventeenth person voted out, and the ninth and final member"
889,01:01:21.96,01:01:21.96,of our jury-- Jerri. You need to bring me your torch.
890,01:01:38.42,01:01:38.42,">> PROBST: Jerri, the tribe has spoken."
891,01:01:44.21,01:01:44.21,">> Bye, guys. >> PROBST: Well, congratulations"
892,01:01:55.79,01:01:55.79,on going as far as you can go in this game.
893,01:01:59.33,01:01:59.33,"Tomorrow night, the power in this game shifts to the jury."
894,01:02:03.04,01:02:03.04,"All you can do is get a good night's sleep, because you're"
895,01:02:05.96,01:02:05.96,going to need your wits about you tomorrow as you attempt to
896,01:02:09.25,01:02:09.25,convince them why you deserve the title of Sole Survivor and
897,01:02:13.17,01:02:13.17,the million dollars that goes along with it.
898,01:02:15.29,01:02:15.29,Grab your torches. We'll see you tomorrow for final
899,01:02:17.88,01:02:17.88,Tribal Council. >> Crap!
900,01:02:22.83,01:02:22.83,One more night! I was so sure I had this one.
901,01:02:28.17,01:02:28.17,This is kind of the Villain way. I'm leaning towards voting for
902,01:02:31.50,01:02:31.50,Russell just because he's played an amazing game.
903,01:02:34.67,01:02:34.67,"He's a little reactionary and hotheaded, but for the most"
904,01:02:37.17,01:02:37.17,"part, Russell makes decisions that make sense."
905,01:02:40.92,01:02:40.92,Except tonight. >> Final three!
906,01:02:54.04,01:02:54.04,>> Unbelievable. Unbelievable. >> It has been quite a ride.
907,01:02:59.17,01:02:59.17,"Ta-da! >> Yeah, I'm ready to go home to"
908,01:03:01.79,01:03:01.79,"my house, my kids and my dog. Although you're trying to focus"
909,01:03:07.75,01:03:07.75,"on the game, you still tend to go back and think about, I"
910,01:03:10.42,01:03:10.42,wonder what my kids are doing. I wonder what my husband's
911,01:03:13.92,01:03:13.92,doing. If I think about my husband--
912,01:03:16.21,01:03:16.21,he's out in Afghanistan. Is he okay?
913,01:03:18.25,01:03:18.25,"Did he make it through today? You know, it's not easy."
914,01:03:22.54,01:03:22.54,"All right, y'all, I think I'm going to bed."
915,01:03:25.50,01:03:25.50,>> What? >> You're going to leave us
916,01:03:27.67,01:03:27.67,"alone? >> Yup, there's no need to"
917,01:03:30.17,01:03:30.17,baby-sit y'all any more. (Russell and Parvati laughs)
918,01:03:32.29,01:03:32.29,"He's out there in Afghanistan fighting for our country, and"
919,01:03:35.88,01:03:35.88,"here I am fighting to be the Sole Survivor, you know."
920,01:03:39.58,01:03:39.58,"Um, but to me, it's worth it. Yeah, I don't get to talk to"
921,01:03:42.67,01:03:42.67,"him. Yeah, I don't know how he's"
922,01:03:45.21,01:03:45.21,"doing, but inside, I know he's okay."
923,01:03:47.88,01:03:47.88,I have that gut feeling. >> Yeah.
924,01:03:52.54,01:03:52.54,>> That's it. >> Yup.
925,01:03:56.33,01:03:56.33,">> So I have to focus on the game, because I came for one"
926,01:03:58.92,01:03:58.92,reason and one reason only-- for another million dollars.
927,01:04:01.67,01:04:01.67,"And if that makes our life easier, then why not?"
928,01:04:05.83,01:04:05.83,This is how I hustle. This is how I make my money.
929,01:04:08.17,01:04:08.17,I come and play  Survivor. That's what I know how to do.
930,01:04:10.79,01:04:10.79,"That's what I'm best at. Coming out here, getting my"
931,01:04:13.96,01:04:13.96,"money, going home. Simple as that."
932,01:04:31.12,01:04:31.12,">> All right, let's go get treemail then."
933,01:04:33.71,01:04:33.71,">> Hmm. Let's do it. >> Day 39, you know, I said I"
934,01:04:37.38,01:04:37.38,"would do it, and here I am. I've done it again."
935,01:04:41.79,01:04:41.79,>> (laughing): Oh! Oh.
936,01:04:43.79,01:04:43.79,"(Sandra mumbles) Oh, my God!"
937,01:04:45.79,01:04:45.79,>> Yes! >> Look at it!
938,01:04:47.79,01:04:47.79,It's amazing! >> Sometimes it makes me want
939,01:04:50.21,01:04:50.21,"to tear up. It really does, because you say"
940,01:04:52.50,01:04:52.50,"you can do it, but it's a lot harder than you really think."
941,01:04:57.12,01:04:57.12,"And I've done it, twice-- day 39."
942,01:04:59.33,01:04:59.33,>> I want a piece of that bread...
943,01:05:01.42,01:05:01.42,>> Yeah. >> ...chunked off in my mouth.
944,01:05:03.46,01:05:03.46,No one's here to tell us no. We're villains.
945,01:05:06.08,01:05:06.08,"(Parvati laughs) >> Tonight, I believe I have a"
946,01:05:08.83,01:05:08.83,"good shot of winning this. Last season, I brought two"
947,01:05:14.17,01:05:14.17,"people, 'cause I thought I could beat them, 'cause they were the"
948,01:05:17.08,01:05:17.08,weak players. And I didn't.
949,01:05:19.50,01:05:19.50,>> I would like to say congratulations to everybody for
950,01:05:23.04,01:05:23.04,making it to the final three. >> I'm bringing people that
951,01:05:27.12,01:05:27.12,other people don't like. Parvati has a lot of enemies.
952,01:05:30.54,01:05:30.54,"Sandra-- she didn't do nothing. At the end of the day, the"
953,01:05:32.54,01:05:32.54,reason she's here is 'cause she's easy to beat.
954,01:05:34.54,01:05:34.54,>> I'm going to have to undo my pants.
955,01:05:36.54,01:05:36.54,>> Oh! >> Aah!
956,01:05:38.54,01:05:38.54,(Parvati laughs) >> Tell me the truth.
957,01:05:40.54,01:05:40.54,"If I would have been on the jury, would you have voted for"
958,01:05:43.21,01:05:43.21,"me? >> I told you, I would have"
959,01:05:45.21,01:05:45.21,voted for Sandra. >> I would have voted for you.
960,01:05:47.21,01:05:47.21,"If you would have put me on the jury, I still would have vote"
961,01:05:49.21,01:05:49.21,for you. >> That's nice of you.
962,01:05:51.21,01:05:51.21,">> But you wouldn't have voted for me, really?"
963,01:05:53.21,01:05:53.21,>> I would have voted for Sandra.
964,01:05:55.21,01:05:55.21,">> No, you... Seriously? >> I told you."
965,01:05:57.21,01:05:57.21,>> Wow. >> I have played the game of
966,01:06:00.88,01:06:00.88,Survivor  for 114 days. I don't know if that makes me
967,01:06:03.62,01:06:03.62,crazy. Probably.
968,01:06:05.96,01:06:05.96,But I think it also makes me one of the best players of
969,01:06:08.58,01:06:08.58,"Survivor,  ever. >> Your game was just like mine,"
970,01:06:11.08,01:06:11.08,"but mine was a little stronger. >> My game was not like yours,"
971,01:06:17.08,01:06:17.08,"not at all. >> Oh, you're gonna hear what I"
972,01:06:19.08,01:06:19.08,think about it at Tribal. >> You say what you want to say.
973,01:06:21.29,01:06:21.29,">> Yeah, we all say what we got got to say."
974,01:06:23.92,01:06:23.92,This is it. Every man for himself now.
975,01:06:26.92,01:06:26.92,">> I'm definitely a little mischievous, a little devious."
976,01:06:30.04,01:06:30.04,"I like to get into trouble. So, I definitely have embraced"
977,01:06:33.67,01:06:33.67,my villain side this time around.
978,01:06:36.21,01:06:36.21,And you know what? I've put my heart and soul into
979,01:06:39.12,01:06:39.12,"this game, and I'm here to win, and that's what I want."
980,01:06:43.04,01:06:43.04,He's so full of himself. >> We're gonna lay this bomb on
981,01:06:45.50,01:06:45.50,him tonight. He don't know what it's like to
982,01:06:49.29,01:06:49.29,be up against two chicks. >> Bam!
983,01:06:51.83,01:06:51.83,>> Ruthless. My God!
984,01:06:53.88,01:06:53.88,I'm going to burn his hat. (Parvati laughs)
985,01:06:56.79,01:06:56.79,">> Oh, my God! (Sandra snorts)"
986,01:06:58.79,01:06:58.79,"Oh, my God, do it! >> So he can take his"
987,01:07:00.92,01:07:00.92,bald-headed ass to be in Tribal Council.
988,01:07:03.21,01:07:03.21,(Parvati laughs) Are you gonna tell?
989,01:07:05.17,01:07:05.17,>> Uh-uh. Are you kidding?
990,01:07:08.17,01:07:08.17,(Parvati laughs) >> That's how much game I've
991,01:07:11.42,01:07:11.42,got. (Parvati laughs)
992,01:07:15.08,01:07:15.08,">> Good work, lady. >> Mm."
993,01:07:18.38,01:07:18.38,">> Russell is obnoxious, so I took his hat, and I threw it in"
994,01:07:22.50,01:07:22.50,the fire. I don't care.
995,01:07:25.38,01:07:25.38,I should burn his sneakers. (Parvati laughs)
996,01:07:29.25,01:07:29.25,He could take his bald-headed tail to Tribal Council.
997,01:07:31.33,01:07:31.33,It'll be all right. He can wear his buff on his
998,01:07:33.88,01:07:33.88,"head. He has a big, bald patch right"
999,01:07:36.17,01:07:36.17,"here, he doesn't want nobody to know about."
1000,01:07:38.88,01:07:38.88,But we've been here for 39 days. I've seen it a whole ton of
1001,01:07:41.71,01:07:41.71,times. Screw it.
1002,01:07:43.71,01:07:43.71,That's payback for everything he's done to me in this game.
1003,01:07:46.50,01:07:46.50,I don't care. >> No.
1004,01:07:52.62,01:07:52.62,">> What the hell. Yeah, y'all haven't seen it?"
1005,01:07:54.67,01:07:54.67,>> No. Did you pack it?
1006,01:07:56.67,01:07:56.67,>> I put it right there. >> Oh.
1007,01:07:58.71,01:07:58.71,>> I know I did. >> I don't think it's about the
1008,01:08:01.12,01:08:01.12,money tonight. I think it's about the title of
1009,01:08:04.04,01:08:04.04,Sole Survivor. That's all Russell wants.
1010,01:08:07.08,01:08:07.08,"And if that's what Russell wants, that's what I got to make"
1011,01:08:09.67,01:08:09.67,"sure Russell does not get. >> I don't get my hat, I ain't"
1012,01:08:12.25,01:08:12.25,"leaving, though. >> Well, we're going to have to"
1013,01:08:14.29,01:08:14.29,leave. >> I don't give a ... 
1014,01:08:16.29,01:08:16.29,>> There's not a day that didn't go by that I was trying to focus
1015,01:08:19.29,01:08:19.29,"on, what's the best way for me to get rid of Russell."
1016,01:08:23.29,01:08:23.29,>> Okay! >> And the worst thing of all is
1017,01:08:27.54,01:08:27.54,"that those Heroes, each and every one of them, are"
1018,01:08:30.71,01:08:30.71,responsible for their own self-destruction.
1019,01:08:32.75,01:08:32.75,"You do it, girl. (whooping)"
1020,01:08:34.75,01:08:34.75,"When I was out here, I had to hustle."
1021,01:08:37.29,01:08:37.29,I had to make sure all my stuff was in order so that when I went
1022,01:08:41.04,01:08:41.04,"to Tribal Council, I made it out in one piece."
1023,01:08:43.71,01:08:43.71,I didn't hide behind no immunity necklace.
1024,01:08:46.17,01:08:46.17,I never had safety. I had to take care of myself.
1025,01:08:49.04,01:08:49.04,(whoops) Look at it go wild.
1026,01:08:53.04,01:08:53.04,"And yet, here I sit, final three."
1027,01:08:56.25,01:08:56.25,I think I deserve it. I want the title of Sole
1028,01:08:59.42,01:08:59.42,Survivor. >> Yeah.
1029,01:09:01.50,01:09:01.50,">> The Heroes built it, and the Villains burn it down."
1030,01:09:31.62,01:09:31.62,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in your jury.
1031,01:09:35.12,01:09:35.12,"Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda,"
1032,01:09:41.17,01:09:41.17,"Candice, Danielle, Rupert, Colby, and Jerri, voted out at"
1033,01:09:48.79,01:09:48.79,"the last Tribal Council. So, after 39 days, here's where"
1034,01:09:56.88,01:09:56.88,we stand. We started with 20 people-- ten
1035,01:09:59.83,01:09:59.83,"Heroes, ten Villains. We are down to three."
1036,01:10:03.92,01:10:03.92,"Parvati, Russell, Sandra. Each of you having played a very"
1037,01:10:08.08,01:10:08.08,"different game of  Survivor. Tonight, the jury takes over."
1038,01:10:13.08,01:10:13.08,"Nine people that you had a hand, either directly or indirectly,"
1039,01:10:17.38,01:10:17.38,in voting out of this game now will decide which one of you
1040,01:10:21.33,01:10:21.33,"wins this game, gets the title of Sole Survivor, and the"
1041,01:10:23.67,01:10:23.67,million dollars that goes with it.
1042,01:10:25.75,01:10:25.75,This is their first chance to address you.
1043,01:10:28.21,01:10:28.21,"I hope you're ready for it, because you will be held"
1044,01:10:31.17,01:10:31.17,accountable. And anybody who lasts 39 days
1045,01:10:34.08,01:10:34.08,in this game will have something to be accountable for.
1046,01:10:38.12,01:10:38.12,Here's how it works. You'll make your opening
1047,01:10:40.12,01:10:40.12,"statements. They'll address you, then we"
1048,01:10:42.71,01:10:42.71,vote. Let's start.
1049,01:10:47.08,01:10:47.08,Sandra. >> Okay.
1050,01:10:49.62,01:10:49.62,"I mean, we all know how Survivor works."
1051,01:10:52.46,01:10:52.46,I've been sole surviving since my alliance was wiped out.
1052,01:10:55.62,01:10:55.62,I got to the Heroes' camp. I tried to get rid of Russell
1053,01:10:59.00,01:10:59.00,three different times. I'd have to work my way around
1054,01:11:02.25,01:11:02.25,"things at camp, try to make sure to take all the precautionary"
1055,01:11:05.92,01:11:05.92,"measures to ensure that when I brought my torch in here lit,"
1056,01:11:10.17,01:11:10.17,that it left here lit. And I did that by myself.
1057,01:11:18.29,01:11:18.29,">> PROBST: Russell. >> You know, uh, everybody"
1058,01:11:21.25,01:11:21.25,thinks that this game is a game of luck.
1059,01:11:23.92,01:11:23.92,"Some cases, I believe it is. In my case, I don't believe it"
1060,01:11:26.54,01:11:26.54,is. I played as hard as I possibly
1061,01:11:29.21,01:11:29.21,"could play, and for some reason, you know, when I come here, I"
1062,01:11:32.88,01:11:32.88,feel that people look at me like I did something wrong.
1063,01:11:35.17,01:11:35.17,You know. I tried to play hard.
1064,01:11:37.88,01:11:37.88,That's what I did. If I did anything to offend
1065,01:11:40.50,01:11:40.50,"anybody in this game, I apologize."
1066,01:11:43.08,01:11:43.08,But I played the game. That's all I can say.
1067,01:11:49.83,01:11:49.83,>> PROBST: Parvati. >> I came into this game
1068,01:11:52.71,01:11:52.71,"knowing, I was going to play with 20 of the best survivors"
1069,01:11:55.21,01:11:55.21,ever. What I didn't realize was the
1070,01:11:58.12,01:11:58.12,threat that I was to everyone in this game.
1071,01:12:02.08,01:12:02.08,"So immediately, I had to put a line of defense together, and"
1072,01:12:05.96,01:12:05.96,"that's where Russell came in. He was, um, the dragon."
1073,01:12:11.12,01:12:11.12,"And instead of slaying him, I kept him as my pet."
1074,01:12:17.46,01:12:17.46,"And he displayed his loyalty at the end to me, and only to me."
1075,01:12:21.79,01:12:21.79,"You know, I think I played the ultimate social game, the"
1076,01:12:25.12,01:12:25.12,ultimate strategic game and the ultimate physical game.
1077,01:12:30.50,01:12:30.50,">> PROBST: All right, jury, in a moment, you'll get your first"
1078,01:12:34.08,01:12:34.08,shot at addressing these guys. I'm going to give you a moment
1079,01:12:37.04,01:12:37.04,"to get your thoughts, and then, they are all yours."
1080,01:12:49.12,01:12:49.12,">> PROBST: All right, jury, it is now your first chance to"
1081,01:12:51.29,01:12:51.29,"address Parvati, Russell, Sandra."
1082,01:12:54.29,01:12:54.29,You're trying to figure out who's most deserving of winning
1083,01:12:57.54,01:12:57.54,"this game. Colby, get us started."
1084,01:13:04.54,01:13:04.54,">> Russell, did you really just say there wasn't any luck"
1085,01:13:07.75,01:13:07.75,"involved in getting you here? >> Yeah, I do."
1086,01:13:09.92,01:13:09.92,I do believe that I got here without any luck.
1087,01:13:12.21,01:13:12.21,I believe I got here with my strategic play.
1088,01:13:14.79,01:13:14.79,">> Okay, well, I was just double-checking, because you are"
1089,01:13:17.08,01:13:17.08,delusional if you think you can make it all the way to the end
1090,01:13:20.17,01:13:20.17,"of this game without any luck. Uh, Parvati, tonight, for me, I"
1091,01:13:24.58,01:13:24.58,need to learn a little bit about strategic plays you made beyond
1092,01:13:28.08,01:13:28.08,"challenges, 'cause you were impressive in the challenges."
1093,01:13:30.96,01:13:30.96,But I want to know what makes you more impressive than those
1094,01:13:33.46,01:13:33.46,"two. >> Right off the bat, I was the"
1095,01:13:36.08,01:13:36.08,"target from the first day. I mean, I'm sitting here against"
1096,01:13:38.83,01:13:38.83,"God's plan, basically. I mean, everyone over there"
1097,01:13:43.21,01:13:43.21,wanted me out. J.T. wrote it in the note that
1098,01:13:46.12,01:13:46.12,"he wanted me out, because y'all thought I was running a girls'"
1099,01:13:48.88,01:13:48.88,"alliance. You know, so I feel like I had"
1100,01:13:52.00,01:13:52.00,to fight harder and make some bolder plays.
1101,01:13:54.04,01:13:54.04,Probably the riskiest move that I made was the day that I had
1102,01:13:56.88,01:13:56.88,"two idols, because I talked to Amanda to see if I could trust"
1103,01:13:59.46,01:13:59.46,"her. Amanda's telling me, ""Save"
1104,01:14:01.54,01:14:01.54,"yourself. We're going to vote you."""
1105,01:14:03.58,01:14:03.58,"I took a huge risk that night, and played the idol for Jerri."
1106,01:14:06.42,01:14:06.42,"I gave it to Jerri to save her, and I gave one to Sandra to save"
1107,01:14:09.83,01:14:09.83,"her, in order to ensure their loyalty to me for the rest of"
1108,01:14:12.08,01:14:12.08,"the game. >> Well, good luck, all three"
1109,01:14:15.04,01:14:15.04,of you. >> Thank you.
1110,01:14:18.21,01:14:18.21,">> PROBST: Coach, you're up. >> Well, the final three"
1111,01:14:25.83,01:14:25.83,"Villains. You've got Parvati, the charmer,"
1112,01:14:29.12,01:14:29.12,"and also, the manipulator. You've got Russell, the schemer,"
1113,01:14:32.25,01:14:32.25,"but also the liar. And you've got Sandra, the"
1114,01:14:34.79,01:14:34.79,"coattail rider. We'll start with you, Russell."
1115,01:14:37.42,01:14:37.42,You can be a very little man in stature and also in word.
1116,01:14:43.17,01:14:43.17,"And the example that you've set here should have been, only the"
1117,01:14:46.88,01:14:46.88,penitent man shall pass. I think if you came into this
1118,01:14:50.25,01:14:50.25,"Tribal, and you said that you crossed the line, I think you"
1119,01:14:52.96,01:14:52.96,might be one of the strongest people in the game.
1120,01:14:55.92,01:14:55.92,"Sandra, I've always said I liked taking the strongest to the end,"
1121,01:14:59.92,01:14:59.92,"and, unfortunately, you were fairly useless in challenges."
1122,01:15:04.17,01:15:04.17,"I played with strength, with honor and with integrity."
1123,01:15:07.46,01:15:07.46,And I wish I could be there in your stead.
1124,01:15:11.29,01:15:11.29,"Parvati, I got to tell you that coming into this game, I was"
1125,01:15:15.33,01:15:15.33,dead wrong about you-- that you were going to be a weak player
1126,01:15:18.04,01:15:18.04,in the challenges. You were a warrior in
1127,01:15:20.96,01:15:20.96,"challenges, and I respect that. The ironic twist of fate is, the"
1128,01:15:27.04,01:15:27.04,day that I finally trusted you was the day that you turned on
1129,01:15:30.67,01:15:30.67,"me. As a Christian man, I give you"
1130,01:15:33.50,01:15:33.50,my word that I came in here tonight without any preconceived
1131,01:15:37.04,01:15:37.04,"notions of who I was going to vote for, and I will be"
1132,01:15:39.62,01:15:39.62,"watching, listening, and I'll be voting for a million dollars."
1133,01:15:44.17,01:15:44.17,I have taken that responsibility quite seriously for this game
1134,01:15:48.04,01:15:48.04,"that I love. >> PROBST: Amanda, you're up."
1135,01:15:54.79,01:15:54.79,(Amanda sighs) >> Hi.
1136,01:15:56.92,01:15:56.92,"Um, Sandra, my question for you is-- tell me how your strategy"
1137,01:16:03.88,01:16:03.88,was better in the game than Russell and Parvati.
1138,01:16:06.25,01:16:06.25,">> I wish my strategy had been better, because had it been"
1139,01:16:10.25,01:16:10.25,"really good, Russell wouldn't be sitting here."
1140,01:16:12.25,01:16:12.25,You don't know how many nights I spent trying my hardest.
1141,01:16:15.88,01:16:15.88,"""How can I get Russell out of this game?"""
1142,01:16:18.25,01:16:18.25,"And what happened was, every time I went to a Hero, I was,"
1143,01:16:21.12,01:16:21.12,"like, ""I can't believe these people don't want Russell out."""
1144,01:16:23.17,01:16:23.17,"And he's taking them out one by one, and every time I go and try"
1145,01:16:27.25,01:16:27.25,"to do something, they run back to Russell."
1146,01:16:29.42,01:16:29.42,It was crazy. >> So did that strategy work
1147,01:16:31.46,01:16:31.46,for you? >> It didn't work for me.
1148,01:16:34.04,01:16:34.04,It just never panned out. I could never get Heroes on my
1149,01:16:36.46,01:16:36.46,side. >> Okay.
1150,01:16:40.38,01:16:40.38,">> PROBST: Courtney, you're up. >> Well, hello, Villains."
1151,01:16:47.25,01:16:47.25,"Congratulations, especially my two Villainesses."
1152,01:16:50.50,01:16:50.50,"Very proud of you both. Parvati, I know you played a,"
1153,01:16:54.21,01:16:54.21,"you know, a good game. I'm really proud of you."
1154,01:16:56.50,01:16:56.50,"Athletic as hell, great. And then there's my girl,"
1155,01:17:00.33,01:17:00.33,"Sandra. You're loyal as hell, and I"
1156,01:17:03.88,01:17:03.88,"think that that's often overlooked, especially in a"
1157,01:17:07.12,01:17:07.12,game like this. And I want to give you an
1158,01:17:09.96,01:17:09.96,"opportunity to defend something that people view as weakness,"
1159,01:17:12.42,01:17:12.42,"when really it's an amazing strength that you take, and you"
1160,01:17:15.17,01:17:15.17,"took all the way to end of Pearl Islands,  and you took all"
1161,01:17:18.46,01:17:18.46,the way to the end this time. >> It's true.
1162,01:17:21.00,01:17:21.00,"When I pick somebody that I'm going to be loyal to, I'm loyal"
1163,01:17:23.67,01:17:23.67,to them till the end. I was loyal to Courtney from the
1164,01:17:26.46,01:17:26.46,"beginning, and she knows that I protected her."
1165,01:17:28.88,01:17:28.88,"Every time I heard anything bad about Courtney, I go bananas,"
1166,01:17:32.08,01:17:32.08,"and I was, like, ""Courtney, you ain't going nowhere."
1167,01:17:34.54,01:17:34.54,"They ain't doing this to you, nothing."""
1168,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,"If I tell you I got your back, I got your back."
1169,01:17:39.38,01:17:39.38,"And if something is wrong, I'm gonna confront you."
1170,01:17:41.67,01:17:41.67,"I'm looking out for you, you should be looking out for me,"
1171,01:17:43.67,01:17:43.67,"but if you ain't, we need to split."
1172,01:17:45.92,01:17:45.92,That's it. I love you girl.
1173,01:17:48.12,01:17:48.12,">> I love  you,  girl. >> All right."
1174,01:17:50.17,01:17:50.17,>> PROBST: You're good? >> Done.
1175,01:17:52.17,01:17:52.17,">> PROBST: Take a seat. >> Thanks, Jeffrey."
1176,01:17:54.12,01:17:54.12,">> PROBST: J.T., you're up. >> Russell, I guess I ought to"
1177,01:18:01.67,01:18:01.67,"talk to you first, old buddy. Good strategy is getting to the"
1178,01:18:04.25,01:18:04.25,"end of the game, then winning the game."
1179,01:18:06.29,01:18:06.29,Getting to the end of the game is half of it.
1180,01:18:08.83,01:18:08.83,The people you voted out-- do you think you've done well at
1181,01:18:11.17,01:18:11.17,preserving their vote for yourself at the end of the game?
1182,01:18:13.71,01:18:13.71,">> I really, seriously, believe that everybody on the jury is"
1183,01:18:17.25,01:18:17.25,"going to respect my game play, especially this group of people"
1184,01:18:21.08,01:18:21.08,that's played the game before and knows how hard it is to play
1185,01:18:24.17,01:18:24.17,the game. And I might not get anybody's
1186,01:18:26.21,01:18:26.21,"vote, but I have to stick to what's going to get me here, and"
1187,01:18:29.58,01:18:29.58,"then hopefully, the jury will respect the way I played the"
1188,01:18:33.25,01:18:33.25,"game. >> How do you think you've done,"
1189,01:18:35.71,01:18:35.71,"Parvati? >> Um, I think..."
1190,01:18:38.58,01:18:38.58,I love Sandra. I think the difference between
1191,01:18:41.83,01:18:41.83,our game was that I was a huge threat from day one.
1192,01:18:45.58,01:18:45.58,"Sandra was kind of a sleeper. Like, she gave 50, 60% in the"
1193,01:18:49.83,01:18:49.83,"challenges. So post-merge, no one thought"
1194,01:18:52.17,01:18:52.17,about voting Sandra off. I  had  to work in those
1195,01:18:54.62,01:18:54.62,"challenges, because everyone was trying to vote me out."
1196,01:18:56.54,01:18:56.54,">> Sandra, did you only give 50 or 60% of the challenges?"
1197,01:19:02.17,01:19:02.17,">> No, no. No. Here's the deal."
1198,01:19:04.17,01:19:04.17,"When it came to the challenges, I gave 110%, but I'm not a"
1199,01:19:07.00,01:19:07.00,"physical person, right? But..."
1200,01:19:10.25,01:19:10.25,>> I know that. >> And you know what I want to
1201,01:19:12.08,01:19:12.08,"tell you, too? I wish I would have known that"
1202,01:19:14.67,01:19:14.67,"you were going to throw that thing in his bag, 'cause if I"
1203,01:19:17.25,01:19:17.25,"could have intercepted that thing, I would have threw it"
1204,01:19:19.54,01:19:19.54,"right back to you, and told you, ""Don't do this."
1205,01:19:21.54,01:19:21.54,"You don't know what you're doing."""
1206,01:19:23.54,01:19:23.54,">> Me, too. >> I mean, I wish..."
1207,01:19:25.54,01:19:25.54,>> I'm not sour about me going out of the game.
1208,01:19:27.54,01:19:27.54,"I made my bed, I can lay in it. Russell, I shook your hand"
1209,01:19:29.54,01:19:29.54,"before I left that night. I'm not out for vengeance, so"
1210,01:19:31.54,01:19:31.54,"so let's be clear on that. >> Yeah, that's what I'm hoping"
1211,01:19:33.75,01:19:33.75,"for. No matter what happens today, I"
1212,01:19:35.79,01:19:35.79,"sit here, and everybody looks at me like I'm the devil."
1213,01:19:38.08,01:19:38.08,"You know, I am playing the game, and I'm playing it hard."
1214,01:19:41.00,01:19:41.00,">> Hey, I'm laying in my bed, partner."
1215,01:19:43.00,01:19:43.00,Lay in yours. >> But I want to be able to...
1216,01:19:45.00,01:19:45.00,>> Lay in your bed like I'm laying in mine...
1217,01:19:47.00,01:19:47.00,">> Yeah, but what I want to do is, you know, be cool"
1218,01:19:49.00,01:19:49.00,afterwards. >> Are you through saying...?
1219,01:19:51.00,01:19:51.00,Thank y'all. >> Thank you.
1220,01:19:52.42,01:19:52.42,">> PROBST: Danielle, you're up. >> Well, well, well, Villains,"
1221,01:19:55.25,01:19:55.25,"Hello! Hello! Um, congrats to all three of you"
1222,01:19:57.88,01:19:57.88,"guys. Russell, it's clear that there's"
1223,01:20:02.25,01:20:02.25,been a lack of skill in your jury management.
1224,01:20:04.71,01:20:04.71,"That being said, what you've heard from all of these people"
1225,01:20:07.04,01:20:07.04,thus far-- would you change anything about your game now?
1226,01:20:10.58,01:20:10.58,">> You know, I don't regret anything that I played, 'cause"
1227,01:20:13.38,01:20:13.38,"if I don't play like that, there's no way I'd be here."
1228,01:20:17.12,01:20:17.12,"If that's what you want me to say, I'm not gonna say that."
1229,01:20:20.04,01:20:20.04,>> No. Would you change anything?
1230,01:20:22.04,01:20:22.04,>> I'm not going to sit here and tell you what you want to hear.
1231,01:20:25.12,01:20:25.12,"I'm going to tell you what... the truth, and I wouldn't"
1232,01:20:27.17,01:20:27.17,change. >> But after hearing what all of
1233,01:20:29.29,01:20:29.29,"these people have said, how you..."
1234,01:20:31.29,01:20:31.29,You're not going to get any votes!
1235,01:20:33.29,01:20:33.29,"Nobody respects the way that you played the game, Russell."
1236,01:20:35.29,01:20:35.29,">> I wouldn't change anything, and I don't regret it."
1237,01:20:37.71,01:20:37.71,>> Okay. That's too bad.
1238,01:20:43.17,01:20:43.17,">> PROBST: Thanks, Danielle. Jerri."
1239,01:20:48.33,01:20:48.33,>> Hi. (laughs)
1240,01:20:50.33,01:20:50.33,I am absolutely 100% undecided who to vote for.
1241,01:20:56.42,01:20:56.42,"Absolutely 100%. So I'm going to start with you,"
1242,01:20:58.96,01:20:58.96,Russell. Right after you win the
1243,01:21:01.21,01:21:01.21,"immunity necklace, the plan was, get rid of Parvati and take me"
1244,01:21:04.50,01:21:04.50,to the end. So carry on from that moment and
1245,01:21:08.08,01:21:08.08,"tell me what happened. >> You know, uh, right after I"
1246,01:21:10.75,01:21:10.75,"won the immunity necklace, that was the plan."
1247,01:21:14.33,01:21:14.33,"And all day, I thought about it, and I thought that it would be a"
1248,01:21:18.21,01:21:18.21,"bad strategic move by me to take you, because you didn't do"
1249,01:21:22.12,01:21:22.12,"anything to anybody on the jury, and if you were sitting next to"
1250,01:21:25.17,01:21:25.17,"me, in my mind, you would have won."
1251,01:21:27.58,01:21:27.58,>> Can I tell you what he told me?
1252,01:21:30.12,01:21:30.12,">> And... yeah, I was just going to say, Parvati, your story?"
1253,01:21:33.38,01:21:33.38,"Because we never talked, so... >> The reason that he told me"
1254,01:21:36.71,01:21:36.71,"that you were leaving is because 100%, he knew he was getting"
1255,01:21:39.88,01:21:39.88,"your vote. He wanted you on the jury, 100%."
1256,01:21:42.17,01:21:42.17,He knows he's getting your vote tonight.
1257,01:21:44.46,01:21:44.46,>> And it makes sense. >> You know what they say about
1258,01:21:46.75,01:21:46.75,assuming. >> Makes an ass out of you and
1259,01:21:48.75,01:21:48.75,me. >> Exactly.
1260,01:21:50.75,01:21:50.75,"So, uh, Sandra, you know, I hear you tell everybody how honest"
1261,01:21:53.04,01:21:53.04,"you are with people, and how you..."
1262,01:21:55.04,01:21:55.04,"When you say you're looking out for somebody, you look out for"
1263,01:21:57.83,01:21:57.83,"them, but I still got blindsided, so you didn't really"
1264,01:22:01.54,01:22:01.54,do that for me. It's tough.
1265,01:22:04.04,01:22:04.04,"I got to say, it is a tough decision."
1266,01:22:06.62,01:22:06.62,"But, um, I appreciate the insights."
1267,01:22:10.04,01:22:10.04,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Candice, you're up."
1268,01:22:18.17,01:22:18.17,">> Congratulations, Final Three, for making it here."
1269,01:22:22.42,01:22:22.42,"Russell, you know, you have to tell lies in this game, but you"
1270,01:22:26.08,01:22:26.08,can go too far. You told dirty lies-- lies that
1271,01:22:31.17,01:22:31.17,you didn't need to tell. And you hurt people doing that.
1272,01:22:35.21,01:22:35.21,"Parvati, you kind of played this game under Russell's thumb the"
1273,01:22:39.79,01:22:39.79,"whole time, like a spouse in a bad, abusive relationship, you"
1274,01:22:44.92,01:22:44.92,"know, and you never got out of it."
1275,01:22:48.25,01:22:48.25,"I wanted you to get out. I wanted it so bad for you, but"
1276,01:22:51.04,01:22:51.04,"you never did. I like you, but I can't support"
1277,01:22:53.71,01:22:53.71,"that. As tough as this game is, it"
1278,01:22:57.08,01:22:57.08,really comes down to how you treat people.
1279,01:23:00.08,01:23:00.08,That's what I'm basing my vote on.
1280,01:23:02.83,01:23:02.83,It's not just what you stand for.
1281,01:23:05.29,01:23:05.29,"It's what you fall for, too. >> PROBST: Thanks, Candice."
1282,01:23:08.62,01:23:08.62,"All right, Rupert, you're up. >> Russell, I want to start"
1283,01:23:16.12,01:23:16.12,with you. To be honest in this game is a
1284,01:23:20.17,01:23:20.17,"very hard thing. To be a manipulative, deceiving,"
1285,01:23:25.71,01:23:25.71,lying person is very easy. You took the easy way out.
1286,01:23:32.33,01:23:32.33,"And if you think you should be proud of how you got here,"
1287,01:23:35.88,01:23:35.88,"you're sadly mistaken. Sandra, sitting here listening"
1288,01:23:41.08,01:23:41.08,to your answers makes me feel even worse about my game play.
1289,01:23:45.17,01:23:45.17,"I wish you and I had talked more, but I had been swayed by"
1290,01:23:50.29,01:23:50.29,what I consider a disgusting human being.
1291,01:23:55.83,01:23:55.83,"You opened the door up for us, and we kept slamming it in your"
