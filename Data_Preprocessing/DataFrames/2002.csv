172,00:12:01.25,00:12:01.25,to really hurt us.We're going to slowly spiral
173,00:12:04.33,00:12:04.33,down into a big pit ofnegativity.
174,00:12:07.58,00:12:07.58,Which I know is only going toget worse.

381,00:22:50.88,00:22:50.88,">> Guys, move this over heretoward me."

383,00:22:53.79,00:22:53.79,"It's not right.>> Y'all, y'all need to listen"

401,00:23:46.12,00:23:46.12,>> Huh?>> He was telling y'all
402,00:23:47.71,00:23:47.71,what to do.>> We were listening.
403,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,">> No, y'all were not.>> James, I didn't say..."
404,00:23:51.21,00:23:51.21,">> No, you were not.He was telling you what to do."
405,00:23:54.21,00:23:54.21,Everybody's mouth want to talk.One voice.
406,00:24:00.67,00:24:00.67,">> James, I don't care who youare, I don't care where we're"
407,00:24:03.96,00:24:03.96,"at, you just don't talk topeople like that."
408,00:24:06.08,00:24:06.08,The problem is I can't sayanything because Rupert already
409,00:24:08.58,00:24:08.58,has it out for me forwhatever reason.
410,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,"Maybe I threaten hispopularity, I don't know."
411,00:24:14.08,00:24:14.08,So I'm just trying to say aslittle as possible.

420,00:24:40.08,00:24:40.08,Grab your stuff.Head back to camp.
421,00:24:42.12,00:24:42.12,I will see you at Tribal.>> Stephenie has been the only
422,00:24:45.46,00:24:45.46,person in Survivor history tolose every person in her tribe
423,00:24:48.71,00:24:48.71,to where she's the only oneone left.
424,00:24:52.17,00:24:52.17,"You know, she's obviouslythe problem."
425,00:24:54.04,00:24:54.04,There's no other source ofkryptonite in here to suck all
426,00:24:57.29,00:24:57.29,"the superheroes' powers but her.And it's, like, wow, you need"
427,00:25:01.00,00:25:01.00,to go home.>> The challenge really
428,00:25:22.62,00:25:22.62,sucked today.The last time we-we failed on
429,00:25:24.79,00:25:24.79,"the puzzle, no one reallystepped up, and this time, I"
430,00:25:27.25,00:25:27.25,"said ""Hey, I've done""this challenge before."
431,00:25:29.25,00:25:29.25,"I'll be the man to runthe puzzle."""
432,00:25:31.08,00:25:31.08,"But there was a few people whohad to say, ""No, please, please"
433,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,"listen to me.""But it would have been a lot"
434,00:25:36.38,00:25:36.38,easier had people just beenlistening instead of
435,00:25:38.54,00:25:38.54,telling me what to do.>>  But no one was listening.
436,00:25:46.29,00:25:46.29,>> Nobody was listening.>> Boston Rob is great
437,00:25:47.83,00:25:47.83,at puzzles.He yelled and screamed
438,00:25:49.38,00:25:49.38,at his team.He told them to shut up.
439,00:25:51.46,00:25:51.46,"They all listened to him,and he won."
440,00:25:53.33,00:25:53.33,">> I could have, I could havetold everybody to shut up, too,"
441,00:25:55.75,00:25:55.75,and I didn't.>> I just wanted everybody to be
442,00:25:57.92,00:25:57.92,quiet and pay attention to whatthat guy had to say.
443,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,>> I think it's justimperative...
444,00:26:01.62,00:26:01.62,">> He was important.>> Like, we have to pack our"
445,00:26:03.67,00:26:03.67,egos at the door and follow whowe designate who's gonna do the
446,00:26:06.75,00:26:06.75,"best job for the challenge.>> One voice, that's all"
447,00:26:09.04,00:26:09.04,I asked is one damn voice.And then I get defensive people.
448,00:26:12.88,00:26:12.88,Then I get people tellingeverybody they wrong.
449,00:26:15.25,00:26:15.25,"I don't want to hear that.One voice next time, y'all."
450,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,That's the only way to getto the top for us as individuals
451,00:26:21.04,00:26:21.04,to shut the ... up and listen tothe guy who's done
452,00:26:23.42,00:26:23.42,the challenge.You can't be defensive when you
453,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,"you lose.You have to say,"
454,00:26:27.29,00:26:27.29,"""It's my fault.""If you're defensive,"
455,00:26:29.21,00:26:29.21,you're wrong.There gonna be other
456,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,"challenges like this.And we need to focus, 'cause I"
457,00:26:33.96,00:26:33.96,ain't never lost this muchin my life.
458,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,That's all I'm saying.This is ridiculous.
459,00:26:39.71,00:26:39.71,Y'all need to suck it up.>> That panicked scream and
460,00:26:54.50,00:26:54.50,"anguished cry of James when hegot back to the hut, you know,"
461,00:26:58.17,00:26:58.17,"all right, great, you've been awinner your whole life."
462,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67,I doubt it.I'd love to tell him what a
463,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,"winner is and what a loser, andwhere he fits into that-that"
464,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,"equation.And once again, that I've got to"
465,00:27:11.21,00:27:11.21,hold my tongue and not respondto that?
466,00:27:13.79,00:27:13.79,That kills me out here.>> We have a tarp! Ow!
467,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,>> This is the most excitingmoment.
468,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,(women laugh)>> Winning the challenge today
469,00:27:32.21,00:27:32.21,"was awesome not only because weavoid Tribal, but also"
470,00:27:35.08,00:27:35.08,because we got a tarp.So hat's off to Boston Rob.
471,00:27:38.71,00:27:38.71,">> Who loves ya, baby?!I got something for you!"
472,00:27:42.21,00:27:42.21,">> Boston Rob worked his ass offat the challenge today, no"
473,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,question about it.I respect that.
474,00:27:47.21,00:27:47.21,>> It's the elusive giant clam.Do you want to touch it?
475,00:27:50.46,00:27:50.46,">> Oh, I don't know.I'm afraid."
476,00:27:52.12,00:27:52.12,>> Come on.You can touch my clam.
477,00:27:54.25,00:27:54.25,"(Jerri laughs)>> Nice work, Rob."
478,00:27:56.71,00:27:56.71,>> Boston Rob thinks that he'sin charge.
479,00:27:59.38,00:27:59.38,I'm starting to think this justain't working out.
480,00:28:02.17,00:28:02.17,I didn't know his personalitywas that strong.
481,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,">> Russell! Oh-oh!>> What, is there a chicken?"
482,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,>> Watch out.>> But you know what?
483,00:28:10.92,00:28:10.92,This is where I'm in charge.I am King Russell from Samoa.
484,00:28:16.17,00:28:16.17,(chickens squawking)>> Yeah-eah! Whoo!
485,00:28:22.79,00:28:22.79,"Whoo-hoo!Got a chicken, baby!"
486,00:28:25.12,00:28:25.12,>> We can make chicken soup.>> We got a chicken.
487,00:28:28.04,00:28:28.04,They trying to catch fish.You gotta catch real food.
488,00:28:33.25,00:28:33.25,(chicken squawks)>> That's true.
489,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,>> Think about it.She's made it to the end
490,00:28:48.92,00:28:48.92,by herself.She was the only person left
491,00:28:50.71,00:28:50.71,on her entire tribe.You mean to tell me that's
492,00:28:53.29,00:28:53.29,good luck?Obviously not.
493,00:28:54.50,00:28:54.50,Something just ain't right.And it got to be her.
494,00:29:06.17,00:29:06.17,They're gonna get rid of meover Amanda?
495,00:29:08.50,00:29:08.50,And we've already lost two?I know it.
496,00:29:18.75,00:29:18.75,She's nullified her whole tribeuntil she was the last one left.
497,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,>> Yep.>> It got to be her.
498,00:29:25.75,00:29:25.75,>> It's a lot different thanat first 'cause everyone
499,00:29:28.83,00:29:28.83,was okay with Sugar going home.She was not a part of any
500,00:29:32.17,00:29:32.17,solid alliance.Now we're looking at a whole
501,00:29:37.17,00:29:37.17,"different ballgame becauseafter tonight, I'm in one"
502,00:29:40.83,00:29:40.83,"alliance in this game.I can either go with James,"
503,00:29:44.62,00:29:44.62,"Rupert and Amanda, and bringCirie and Candice along"
504,00:29:47.58,00:29:47.58,"or I can go with Colby, Tom,Stephenie, and bring Candice and"
505,00:29:51.00,00:29:51.00,"Cirie along.So, one thing that I do know,"
506,00:29:55.08,00:29:55.08,we gonna piss a few people off.>> It's okay.
507,00:30:00.58,00:30:00.58,It's as much my fault as anyfor not pushing harder to be in
508,00:30:04.54,00:30:04.54,the challenge.>> Okay?
509,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,>> Rupert's over there talkingto J.T. now.
510,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,">> Right.>> Yeah, they're all..."
511,00:30:13.54,00:30:13.54,">> Right, right.>> We're the three on the outs."
512,00:30:15.71,00:30:15.71,"It's all on the line today.We know what we're up against,"
513,00:30:19.71,00:30:19.71,"and I'm not, I don't have anyfalse illusions of loyalty"
514,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,from J.T. at this point.This is the way it's gonna
515,00:30:31.54,00:30:31.54,"go down: the order's gonna beStephenie, me, you."
516,00:30:34.42,00:30:34.42,We have to convince Candice andCirie that the order's gonna be
517,00:30:40.12,00:30:40.12,"Stephenie, Cirie...>> ...Candice."
518,00:30:42.67,00:30:42.67,>> ...Candice.If I can get Cirie and Candice
519,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,"to switch over with ourthreesome, send Amanda home,"
520,00:30:50.00,00:30:50.00,then we're controlling thisthis game.
521,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,>> Right.>> So the plan is to get rid of
522,00:31:21.42,00:31:21.42,"the weakest first, so that wouldhelp us if we got rid of Amanda."
523,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,The problem with that plan is wedon't know if J.T. is with us or
524,00:31:29.00,00:31:29.00,"not, so if Tom, Colby and myselfcan pull in Cirie and Candice,"
525,00:31:33.88,00:31:33.88,maybe I am safe and we're gonnaget our five strong and come out
526,00:31:37.75,00:31:37.75,of this all right tonight....but I can guarantee...
527,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,>> Right.>> I can promise you that.
528,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,...either you or Cirie if wehave to go to another Tribal
529,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"Council, and then whoever's leftof that pass."
530,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,And I think we've got a betterdeal for you.
531,00:32:05.75,00:32:05.75,>> This vote today is crucialbecause the line will be drawn
532,00:32:08.71,00:32:08.71,"in the sand, and you'll be onone side or the other."
533,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,And I feel like I'm on thebottom of either alliance.
534,00:32:15.33,00:32:15.33,"So I'm, like, ""Which way""do I go?"
535,00:32:17.79,00:32:17.79,"Which way is it worse?""I don't know."
536,00:32:20.04,00:32:20.04,"I'm really not in a goodposition anyways, you know"
537,00:32:22.67,00:32:22.67,what I mean?>> I think you're in
538,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,the position.I think you're the swing
539,00:32:26.12,00:32:26.12,"vote tonight.>> Everybody wants me to vote,"
540,00:32:27.75,00:32:27.75,"you know, one way tonight, butwhat about me down the road,"
541,00:32:31.83,00:32:31.83,you know?>> Right.
542,00:32:33.12,00:32:33.12,">> So, I mean, I really got tothink what's best for me."
543,00:32:36.25,00:32:36.25,>> Yep. So one assurance thatyou would have: they all
544,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,go home before you ever go home.You're not gonna get that deal
545,00:32:44.33,00:32:44.33,on their side.>> Yeah.
546,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,>> I'm not even gonna ask youwhat you're gonna do.
547,00:32:48.79,00:32:48.79,You and Cirie are gonna have todecide if this is a move that
548,00:32:51.96,00:32:51.96,"makes sense to you.Tom, Colby, Stephenie are"
549,00:32:53.79,00:32:53.79,writing Amanda's name down.I'm trusting my gut on this.
550,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,"And I think you should trustyour gut on this, too, and"
551,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,"see where it takes you.>> All right, so what's the"
552,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,deal?>> Tell me everything.
553,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,What's going on?>> I just want to do what's
554,00:33:14.04,00:33:14.04,"best, ultimately best, for thelong run, for now."
555,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"The problem with this decisionis, once this decision is made,"
556,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,all the cards are out.>> I know you guys are all
557,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,"tight, and I don't know, like,any of you guys from before and"
558,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,"all that stuff, and, like...>> See that's the problem."
559,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,I don't know why everybodythinks we're so tight.
