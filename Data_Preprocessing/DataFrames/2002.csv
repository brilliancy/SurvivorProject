3,00:00:08.17,00:00:08.17,Survivor's most memorable castaways played the game with

5,00:00:17.67,00:00:17.67,tried to show that good will win.

7,00:00:23.21,00:00:23.21,backstabbing. >> I'm the original villainess

9,00:00:28.79,00:00:28.79,right now with these people. >> PROBST: In the historic 20th
10,00:00:36.33,00:00:36.33,"season of Survivor, ten of the most notorious villains have"
11,00:00:41.12,00:00:41.12,returned to face ten of the greatest heroes.
12,00:00:44.92,00:00:44.92,Russell has the bag for the Villains!
13,00:00:47.25,00:00:47.25,The first challenge was a fierce battle.
14,00:00:50.50,00:00:50.50,The Heroes suffered two injuries...
15,00:00:56.62,00:00:56.62,>> PROBST: ...but ultimately prevailed.
16,00:00:58.04,00:00:58.04,"Heroes win reward! Filled with confidence, the"
17,00:01:00.92,00:01:00.92,Heroes worked well together and built a solid camp.
18,00:01:03.88,00:01:03.88,">> I love my tribe. We have a good aura, we have"
19,00:01:06.25,00:01:06.25,good energy. >> PROBST: But not every Hero
20,00:01:08.54,00:01:08.54,acted heroically. J.T. dipped into the Villains'
21,00:01:11.38,00:01:11.38,playbook and formed conflicting alliances.
22,00:01:14.46,00:01:14.46,>> I'm gonna form alliances with everyone I can.
23,00:01:16.50,00:01:16.50,So it's gonna be a whole different ball game for me.
24,00:01:19.17,00:01:19.17,">> PROBST: At the Villains' beach, Boston Rob was the only"
25,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,"one who worked, and the camp suffered."
26,00:01:24.04,00:01:24.04,">> They don't want to build a shelter, they don't want to try"
27,00:01:27.12,00:01:27.12,"to get a fire going, there's nobody here that wants to do"
28,00:01:30.17,00:01:30.17,anything. >> PROBST: But unbeknownst to
29,00:01:33.04,00:01:33.04,"Rob, Russell was very busy. >> We're gonna be better of a"
30,00:01:36.83,00:01:36.83,pair than you can even possibly imagine.
31,00:01:38.83,00:01:38.83,>> I agree. >> PROBST: Up to his old tricks
32,00:01:41.25,00:01:41.25,making secret deals with Danielle and Parvati.
33,00:01:43.92,00:01:43.92,">> With Russell, I definitely feel like I am making a deal"
34,00:01:46.96,00:01:46.96,with the devil-- but I want the devil on my side.
35,00:01:49.25,00:01:49.25,>> PROBST: And Coach was making gallant advances towards Jerri.
36,00:01:53.25,00:01:53.25,">> Jerri and I, we have a little connection."
37,00:01:56.79,00:01:56.79,(laughs) >> PROBST: Survivors ready?
38,00:01:59.29,00:01:59.29,"Go! >> Come on, Heroes!"
39,00:02:01.17,00:02:01.17,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, the Heroes opened a"
40,00:02:03.42,00:02:03.42,huge lead. Heroes look like they've been
41,00:02:06.25,00:02:06.25,paddling together forever! >> Yeah!
42,00:02:08.62,00:02:08.62,">> PROBST: But when they got to the puzzle, things changed."
43,00:02:11.04,00:02:11.04,Heroes still trying to figure out the first piece of this
44,00:02:14.00,00:02:14.00,"puzzle. >> Wait, maybe there's two"
45,00:02:15.50,00:02:15.50,different pieces that fit... >> PROBST: Sugar and Amanda were
46,00:02:17.83,00:02:17.83,"unable to work together, allowing the Villains to pull"
47,00:02:20.62,00:02:20.62,ahead. Villains win first immunity
48,00:02:23.00,00:02:23.00,"challenge! At Tribal Council, the Heroes"
49,00:02:27.21,00:02:27.21,unanimously voted to make Sugar pay for her poor performance at
50,00:02:31.04,00:02:31.04,"the challenge. Sugar, the tribe has spoken."
51,00:02:33.92,00:02:33.92,And now both tribes are facing tough questions.
52,00:02:37.08,00:02:37.08,Did the Heroes make the right choice to strengthen their
53,00:02:39.79,00:02:39.79,tribe? (thunder crashes)
54,00:02:41.75,00:02:41.75,"As for the Villains, with torrential sea storms on the"
55,00:02:44.46,00:02:44.46,"way, will the lack of shelter zap their strength and kill any"
56,00:02:48.46,00:02:48.46,chance of future victory? (thunder crashing)
57,00:02:55.88,00:02:55.88,">> (laughs): Paradise, my ass! >> Man, it's worse underneath"
58,00:03:08.17,00:03:08.17,"there than it is out here. Pouring down rain, like, five"
59,00:03:11.29,00:03:11.29,people want to... are ready to die.
60,00:03:13.54,00:03:13.54,">> It's so cold. >> Everybody's crying, and I"
61,00:03:15.83,00:03:15.83,can't take it anymore. The main thing we should be
62,00:03:18.21,00:03:18.21,doing is trying to make a fire and trying to get our shelter
63,00:03:20.92,00:03:20.92,"good. Nobody wants to step up, and"
64,00:03:23.50,00:03:23.50,"they want to sit in the rain night after night, and it's"
65,00:03:26.83,00:03:26.83,"making me physically sick, you know?"
66,00:03:30.54,00:03:30.54,">> Unbelievable, man. (coughs)"
67,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83,">> It's, like, again, again, again I'm on the buffoon tribe,"
68,00:03:39.58,00:03:39.58,"again. I was on Marquesas, I was on"
69,00:03:42.17,00:03:42.17,"on All-Stars, and again now. >> I don't know what I'm gonna"
70,00:03:46.25,00:03:46.25,do. (theme song playing)

72,00:05:05.25,00:05:05.25,>> (sighs): This is... this is rough.
73,00:05:08.33,00:05:08.33,"People are freaking out. I mean, there was a lot of"
74,00:05:11.46,00:05:11.46,complaining last night. >> It's gonna get worse.
75,00:05:14.88,00:05:14.88,">> I know, and it's only day four."
76,00:05:17.17,00:05:17.17,>> It's all gonna come down to... what people got upstairs.
77,00:05:20.83,00:05:20.83,">> Yep. That's what Rob said. He said, ""Here we go."
78,00:05:24.46,00:05:24.46,"It's the beginning."" >> So, here we are on day four,"
79,00:05:51.08,00:05:51.08,"on... at least design four, probably design five of the"
80,00:05:54.04,00:05:54.04,shelter. The first one was the best and
81,00:05:57.67,00:05:57.67,"the strongest and semi-leak-proof, and each"
82,00:06:01.08,00:06:01.08,"subsequent shelter gets worse and worse and worse, and now"
83,00:06:04.88,00:06:04.88,we're... we're doing it again. >> So the shelter's just gonna
84,00:06:09.50,00:06:09.50,"come up in the back, then it's gonna come down in the front."
85,00:06:12.46,00:06:12.46,"Right? Like a lean-to? But we'll stop it, like, about"
86,00:06:15.17,00:06:15.17,three feet. >> I don't... I think we should
87,00:06:17.17,00:06:17.17,"keep it low like that, don't you?"
88,00:06:19.04,00:06:19.04,>> I think we should just... >> I think we should keep it low
89,00:06:21.04,00:06:21.04,"and then just put the roof on. >> Yeah, let them do what they"
90,00:06:23.17,00:06:23.17,want to do. I don't think we should
91,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,"complain. >> We can make it lower, too."
92,00:06:27.04,00:06:27.04,">> No, I just, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying an"
93,00:06:29.25,00:06:29.25,opinion. >> Never mind. I got it.
94,00:06:35.50,00:06:35.50,">> Boston Rob is, like, the bright, shining star, and he"
95,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,just gets so frustrated with these fools.
96,00:06:40.12,00:06:40.12,"I hope he doesn't drop dead in the next few days, 'cause we'll"
97,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,all die. There's just no way around it.
98,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,"But if you only do a few bamboo, you don't need to make this,"
99,00:06:48.92,00:06:48.92,like... >> Reinforced.
100,00:06:50.71,00:06:50.71,>> ...structure. Do you know what I mean?
101,00:07:02.75,00:07:02.75,">> I thought we didn't have a lot of time, so..."
102,00:07:18.54,00:07:18.54,">> Oh, there's the leaves. >> Well, this row and that"
103,00:07:21.96,00:07:21.96,"row, it's gonna cover all that. >> We're at the Heroes camp."
104,00:07:25.29,00:07:25.29,"I mean, we're a bunch of professional and seasoned"
105,00:07:29.04,00:07:29.04,survivors. We're some of the best survivors
106,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,"ever, the greatest. >> Let Colby cut that one out."
107,00:07:38.88,00:07:38.88,He just marked them. He ought to know just how big
108,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,"y'all need 'em. >> Man, I love a working tribe."
109,00:07:43.79,00:07:43.79,">> I know, isn't it nice? >> Yes."
110,00:07:46.42,00:07:46.42,>> Be with people who know what they're doing.
111,00:07:48.79,00:07:48.79,">> Should we make coconut, or what do you think?"
112,00:07:51.04,00:07:51.04,>> Roasted coconut? >> Yeah.
113,00:07:53.08,00:07:53.08,">> Yeah, popcorn? >> Let's do that."
114,00:07:54.62,00:07:54.62,">> Stephenie. For my game, it is a very good"
115,00:07:59.42,00:07:59.42,"idea for me to get rid of Steph. I mean, she's a sweet girl,"
116,00:08:02.96,00:08:02.96,but... (growling)
117,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,"...in the game, I think Stephenie would side with anyone"
118,00:08:09.21,00:08:09.21,that got her one day further. >> Let it brown a little more
119,00:08:12.46,00:08:12.46,"like that one, right? >> You want it to get crispy."
120,00:08:15.04,00:08:15.04,>> It's sticking pretty bad. >> They're doing popcorn
121,00:08:17.50,00:08:17.50,"different than I ever did it, so..."
122,00:08:19.21,00:08:19.21,Cook it dry and then stir it around in the sea salt.
123,00:08:21.25,00:08:21.25,See all that white on the sides-- it's salt.
124,00:08:26.71,00:08:26.71,>> I don't know. You're the cook.
125,00:08:30.12,00:08:30.12,>> (growls) >> Rupert's starting to get a
126,00:08:33.21,00:08:33.21,"little bit annoying. Every time you turn around, he's"
127,00:08:37.46,00:08:37.46,got an opinion about everything. Like the coconut.
128,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,>> Isn't that good? >> That's good as hell.
129,00:08:45.08,00:08:45.08,>> Yeah. >> When you make 'em little
130,00:08:47.04,00:08:47.04,teeny chunks your saliva mixes in with them enough that you
131,00:08:50.08,00:08:50.08,"don't taste the hull as much, and it's popcorn."
132,00:08:53.17,00:08:53.17,>> I'm just sitting back being quiet.
133,00:08:55.42,00:08:55.42,Because he could be trying to get me out of this game.
134,00:08:57.58,00:08:57.58,I honestly think the guy is playing out the good guy role
135,00:09:00.50,00:09:00.50,"out here, and he is a good guy-- I'm not saying he's not, but"
136,00:09:03.21,00:09:03.21,"it's just, you know, it's overkill right now."
137,00:09:06.12,00:09:06.12,It's day four. Like whoa.
138,00:09:16.96,00:09:16.96,">> No, we're going to tie each individual one to this."
139,00:09:22.21,00:09:22.21,No. With a knife. >> I need some more water.
140,00:09:29.79,00:09:29.79,The shelter sucks. It's terrible.
141,00:09:33.29,00:09:33.29,"And you know what I should have done from day one was,"
142,00:09:35.79,00:09:35.79,"""Listen, you're gonna listen to me."
143,00:09:37.33,00:09:37.33,This is the way we're going to do it.
144,00:09:39.00,00:09:39.00,"If you don't like it, that's fine, I'll mark you down and"
145,00:09:40.79,00:09:40.79,"you'll be voted off first."" I didn't want to be a dictator"
146,00:09:51.88,00:09:51.88,this time around. I wanted to be the diplomat.
147,00:09:54.83,00:09:54.83,And look at where that got me. Running in circles.
148,00:09:57.67,00:09:57.67,"I mean, they got me, they got me good, they whipped me."
149,00:10:01.42,00:10:01.42,"And I just-- it, like hit me. I said, ""That's enough, it's"
150,00:10:04.50,00:10:04.50,"over, it's done."" That's it."
151,00:10:08.12,00:10:08.12,>> So no more house? >> No more. I'm done.
152,00:10:12.67,00:10:12.67,"You get me, right? You feel me?"
153,00:10:14.17,00:10:14.17,>> I understand. It's frustrating.
154,00:10:21.46,00:10:21.46,">> Oh, God! >> Are you guys going to...?"
155,00:10:24.12,00:10:24.12,>> Why can't we have James and Colby and Tom and Rupert?
156,00:10:28.08,00:10:28.08,">> How did they get every, like, awesome guy and we got Randy."
157,00:10:31.21,00:10:31.21,">> Are things going to get better at all, before they get"
158,00:10:34.71,00:10:34.71,"worse? >> What's, uh, what's Rob doing?"
159,00:10:45.33,00:10:45.33,Why did he walk away? >> I don't know.
160,00:10:47.08,00:10:47.08,"I think everybody's kind of having a meltdown, but..."
161,00:11:14.58,00:11:14.58,">> Rob? Hey, Rob? Rob?"
162,00:11:20.08,00:11:20.08,Talk to me. Rob.
163,00:11:24.83,00:11:24.83,Talk to me. What's going on?
164,00:11:28.12,00:11:28.12,Will you just open your eyes please?
165,00:11:30.38,00:11:30.38,"Please, Rob, come on, just look at me."
166,00:11:33.21,00:11:33.21,Your head hurts? >> Yeah.
167,00:11:35.25,00:11:35.25,">> What do you want me to do? All right, I'll be right back."
168,00:11:41.62,00:11:41.62,"Okay? I saw the whole thing, and, uh, "
169,00:11:49.21,00:11:49.21,"it really scared me. I mean, I don't want to see"
170,00:11:52.04,00:11:52.04,anybody get hurt. This is-- this is where Survivor
171,00:11:55.88,00:11:55.88,"gets serious, because it involves your life beyond the"
172,00:11:58.38,00:11:58.38,"the game. And without Rob here, it's going"
173,00:12:01.25,00:12:01.25,to really hurt us. We're going to slowly spiral
174,00:12:04.33,00:12:04.33,down into a big pit of negativity.
175,00:12:07.58,00:12:07.58,Which I know is only going to get worse.
176,00:12:10.50,00:12:10.50,">> All right, you've got the medical team here now."
177,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,We're going to see how you are. Can you open your eyes for us?
178,00:12:17.71,00:12:17.71,">> PROBST: Rob, can you hear me? Rob?"
179,00:12:23.00,00:12:23.00,Coming up next: Can you hear me?
180,00:12:25.08,00:12:25.08,>> Wait. >> I feel like...
181,00:12:32.58,00:12:32.58,"It's getting the best of me. >> PROBST: Rob, can you hear me?"
182,00:12:44.25,00:12:44.25,">> What's the problem, Rob? >> 140/70."
183,00:12:49.92,00:12:49.92,">> All right, got some water here for you, mate."
184,00:12:51.54,00:12:51.54,"Can you lift your hand up and just pour the water in yourself,"
185,00:12:53.08,00:12:53.08,yeah? That's the way.
186,00:12:55.58,00:12:55.58,Wait. >> The funny thing about being
187,00:12:58.21,00:12:58.21,unconscious is you don't remember anything.

377,00:22:39.96,00:22:39.96,>> Here we go! Here we go! >> Just get it up!
378,00:22:42.21,00:22:42.21,">> That's not... >> Yeah, is that right?"
379,00:22:43.96,00:22:43.96,>> That's not right. That's not right.
380,00:22:47.17,00:22:47.17,>> It's not right. We had it right!
381,00:22:48.79,00:22:48.79,>> Get it back down. Get it where it was.
382,00:22:50.88,00:22:50.88,">> Guys, move this over here toward me."
383,00:22:52.38,00:22:52.38,>> What? >> It's not right.
384,00:22:53.79,00:22:53.79,"It's not right. >> Y'all, y'all need to listen"
385,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,to one voice. >> PROBST: Heroes now starting
386,00:22:58.25,00:22:58.25,to get frustrated. >> Put it back where it was.
387,00:23:00.92,00:23:00.92,>> What are we doing? >> Straight up.
388,00:23:02.38,00:23:02.38,>> Push it! >> A little bit more!
389,00:23:04.96,00:23:04.96,">> PROBST: Villains have one piece left, but it's gotta come"
390,00:23:07.42,00:23:07.42,all the way to the top! >> Push it!
391,00:23:09.46,00:23:09.46,>> Push this. Somebody push this toward me.
392,00:23:11.92,00:23:11.92,>> Which way? >> Spin it that way towards Tom.
393,00:23:14.54,00:23:14.54,"Go. >> No, no, this is not right."
394,00:23:16.67,00:23:16.67,>> J.T./TOM: Yes! >> Shut up! Shut up!
395,00:23:19.12,00:23:19.12,>> PROBST: Heroes talking trash to each other.
396,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,Not a good sign. >> Everybody lifting?
397,00:23:25.33,00:23:25.33,>> We got it! We got it! >> PROBST: Villains think they
398,00:23:30.08,00:23:30.08,"have it. Get to the top, Villains!"
399,00:23:34.83,00:23:34.83,Villains win second immunity challenge in a row!
400,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,"(Villains cheering) >> Let's go home and just relax,"
401,00:23:43.75,00:23:43.75,"dude. >> Gotta have one voice, y'all."
402,00:23:46.12,00:23:46.12,>> Huh? >> He was telling y'all
403,00:23:47.71,00:23:47.71,what to do. >> We were listening.
404,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,">> No, y'all were not. >> James, I didn't say..."
405,00:23:51.21,00:23:51.21,">> No, you were not. He was telling you what to do."
406,00:23:54.21,00:23:54.21,Everybody's mouth want to talk. One voice.
407,00:24:00.67,00:24:00.67,">> James, I don't care who you are, I don't care where we're"
408,00:24:03.96,00:24:03.96,"at, you just don't talk to people like that."
409,00:24:06.08,00:24:06.08,The problem is I can't say anything because Rupert already
410,00:24:08.58,00:24:08.58,has it out for me for whatever reason.
411,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,"Maybe I threaten his popularity, I don't know."
412,00:24:14.08,00:24:14.08,So I'm just trying to say as little as possible.
413,00:24:16.96,00:24:16.96,">> PROBST: Villains, congratulations once again."
414,00:24:18.75,00:24:18.75,">> Whoo! >> PROBST: Two challenges,"
415,00:24:20.42,00:24:20.42,two victories. >> Yeah.
416,00:24:24.08,00:24:24.08,">> PROBST: Villains, grab your tarp, rope, nails."
417,00:24:27.08,00:24:27.08,"Head on back to camp. >> Good job, guys."
418,00:24:31.92,00:24:31.92,">> Peace out. >> PROBST: Heroes, gonna be an"
419,00:24:35.25,00:24:35.25,"interesting afternoon as for the second time in a row, you"
420,00:24:38.38,00:24:38.38,guys will lose somebody at Tribal Council.
421,00:24:40.08,00:24:40.08,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
422,00:24:42.12,00:24:42.12,I will see you at Tribal. >> Stephenie has been the only
423,00:24:45.46,00:24:45.46,person in Survivor history to lose every person in her tribe
424,00:24:48.71,00:24:48.71,to where she's the only one one left.
425,00:24:52.17,00:24:52.17,"You know, she's obviously the problem."
426,00:24:54.04,00:24:54.04,There's no other source of kryptonite in here to suck all
427,00:24:57.29,00:24:57.29,"the superheroes' powers but her. And it's, like, wow, you need"
428,00:25:01.00,00:25:01.00,to go home. >> The challenge really
429,00:25:22.62,00:25:22.62,sucked today. The last time we-we failed on
430,00:25:24.79,00:25:24.79,"the puzzle, no one really stepped up, and this time, I"
431,00:25:27.25,00:25:27.25,"said ""Hey, I've done ""this challenge before."
432,00:25:29.25,00:25:29.25,"I'll be the man to run the puzzle."""
433,00:25:31.08,00:25:31.08,"But there was a few people who had to say, ""No, please, please"
434,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,"listen to me."" But it would have been a lot"
435,00:25:36.38,00:25:36.38,easier had people just been listening instead of
436,00:25:38.54,00:25:38.54,telling me what to do. >>  But no one was listening.
437,00:25:46.29,00:25:46.29,>> Nobody was listening. >> Boston Rob is great
438,00:25:47.83,00:25:47.83,at puzzles. He yelled and screamed
439,00:25:49.38,00:25:49.38,at his team. He told them to shut up.
440,00:25:51.46,00:25:51.46,"They all listened to him, and he won."
441,00:25:53.33,00:25:53.33,">> I could have, I could have told everybody to shut up, too,"
442,00:25:55.75,00:25:55.75,and I didn't. >> I just wanted everybody to be
443,00:25:57.92,00:25:57.92,quiet and pay attention to what that guy had to say.
444,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,>> I think it's just imperative...
445,00:26:01.62,00:26:01.62,">> He was important. >> Like, we have to pack our"
446,00:26:03.67,00:26:03.67,egos at the door and follow who we designate who's gonna do the
447,00:26:06.75,00:26:06.75,"best job for the challenge. >> One voice, that's all"
448,00:26:09.04,00:26:09.04,I asked is one damn voice. And then I get defensive people.
449,00:26:12.88,00:26:12.88,Then I get people telling everybody they wrong.
450,00:26:15.25,00:26:15.25,"I don't want to hear that. One voice next time, y'all."
451,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,That's the only way to get to the top for us as individuals
452,00:26:21.04,00:26:21.04,to shut the ... up and listen to the guy who's done
453,00:26:23.42,00:26:23.42,the challenge. You can't be defensive when you
454,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,"you lose. You have to say,"
455,00:26:27.29,00:26:27.29,"""It's my fault."" If you're defensive,"
456,00:26:29.21,00:26:29.21,you're wrong. There gonna be other
457,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,"challenges like this. And we need to focus, 'cause I"
458,00:26:33.96,00:26:33.96,ain't never lost this much in my life.
459,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,That's all I'm saying. This is ridiculous.
460,00:26:39.71,00:26:39.71,Y'all need to suck it up. >> That panicked scream and
461,00:26:54.50,00:26:54.50,"anguished cry of James when he got back to the hut, you know,"
462,00:26:58.17,00:26:58.17,"all right, great, you've been a winner your whole life."
463,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67,I doubt it. I'd love to tell him what a
464,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,"winner is and what a loser, and where he fits into that-that"
465,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,"equation. And once again, that I've got to"
466,00:27:11.21,00:27:11.21,hold my tongue and not respond to that?
467,00:27:13.79,00:27:13.79,That kills me out here. >> We have a tarp! Ow!
468,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,>> This is the most exciting moment.
469,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,(women laugh) >> Winning the challenge today
470,00:27:32.21,00:27:32.21,"was awesome not only because we avoid Tribal, but also"
471,00:27:35.08,00:27:35.08,because we got a tarp. So hat's off to Boston Rob.
472,00:27:38.71,00:27:38.71,">> Who loves ya, baby?! I got something for you!"
473,00:27:42.21,00:27:42.21,">> Boston Rob worked his ass off at the challenge today, no"
474,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,question about it. I respect that.
475,00:27:47.21,00:27:47.21,>> It's the elusive giant clam. Do you want to touch it?
476,00:27:50.46,00:27:50.46,">> Oh, I don't know. I'm afraid."
477,00:27:52.12,00:27:52.12,>> Come on. You can touch my clam.
478,00:27:54.25,00:27:54.25,"(Jerri laughs) >> Nice work, Rob."
479,00:27:56.71,00:27:56.71,>> Boston Rob thinks that he's in charge.
480,00:27:59.38,00:27:59.38,I'm starting to think this just ain't working out.
481,00:28:02.17,00:28:02.17,I didn't know his personality was that strong.
482,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,">> Russell! Oh-oh! >> What, is there a chicken?"
483,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,>> Watch out. >> But you know what?
484,00:28:10.92,00:28:10.92,This is where I'm in charge. I am King Russell from Samoa.
485,00:28:16.17,00:28:16.17,(chickens squawking) >> Yeah-eah! Whoo!
486,00:28:22.79,00:28:22.79,"Whoo-hoo! Got a chicken, baby!"
487,00:28:25.12,00:28:25.12,>> We can make chicken soup. >> We got a chicken.
488,00:28:28.04,00:28:28.04,They trying to catch fish. You gotta catch real food.
489,00:28:33.25,00:28:33.25,(chicken squawks) >> That's true.
490,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,>> Think about it. She's made it to the end
491,00:28:48.92,00:28:48.92,by herself. She was the only person left
492,00:28:50.71,00:28:50.71,on her entire tribe. You mean to tell me that's
493,00:28:53.29,00:28:53.29,good luck? Obviously not.
494,00:28:54.50,00:28:54.50,Something just ain't right. And it got to be her.
495,00:29:06.17,00:29:06.17,They're gonna get rid of me over Amanda?
496,00:29:08.50,00:29:08.50,And we've already lost two? I know it.
497,00:29:18.75,00:29:18.75,She's nullified her whole tribe until she was the last one left.
498,00:29:23.21,00:29:23.21,>> Yep. >> It got to be her.
499,00:29:25.75,00:29:25.75,>> It's a lot different than at first 'cause everyone
500,00:29:28.83,00:29:28.83,was okay with Sugar going home. She was not a part of any
501,00:29:32.17,00:29:32.17,solid alliance. Now we're looking at a whole
502,00:29:37.17,00:29:37.17,"different ballgame because after tonight, I'm in one"
503,00:29:40.83,00:29:40.83,"alliance in this game. I can either go with James,"
504,00:29:44.62,00:29:44.62,"Rupert and Amanda, and bring Cirie and Candice along"
505,00:29:47.58,00:29:47.58,"or I can go with Colby, Tom, Stephenie, and bring Candice and"
506,00:29:51.00,00:29:51.00,"Cirie along. So, one thing that I do know,"
507,00:29:55.08,00:29:55.08,we gonna piss a few people off. >> It's okay.
508,00:30:00.58,00:30:00.58,It's as much my fault as any for not pushing harder to be in
509,00:30:04.54,00:30:04.54,the challenge. >> Okay?
510,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,>> Rupert's over there talking to J.T. now.
511,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,">> Right. >> Yeah, they're all..."
512,00:30:13.54,00:30:13.54,">> Right, right. >> We're the three on the outs."
513,00:30:15.71,00:30:15.71,"It's all on the line today. We know what we're up against,"
514,00:30:19.71,00:30:19.71,"and I'm not, I don't have any false illusions of loyalty"
515,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,from J.T. at this point. This is the way it's gonna
516,00:30:31.54,00:30:31.54,"go down: the order's gonna be Stephenie, me, you."
517,00:30:34.42,00:30:34.42,We have to convince Candice and Cirie that the order's gonna be
518,00:30:40.12,00:30:40.12,"Stephenie, Cirie... >> ...Candice."
519,00:30:42.67,00:30:42.67,>> ...Candice. If I can get Cirie and Candice
520,00:30:47.21,00:30:47.21,"to switch over with our threesome, send Amanda home,"
521,00:30:50.00,00:30:50.00,then we're controlling this this game.
522,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,>> Right. >> So the plan is to get rid of
523,00:31:21.42,00:31:21.42,"the weakest first, so that would help us if we got rid of Amanda."
524,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,The problem with that plan is we don't know if J.T. is with us or
525,00:31:29.00,00:31:29.00,"not, so if Tom, Colby and myself can pull in Cirie and Candice,"
526,00:31:33.88,00:31:33.88,maybe I am safe and we're gonna get our five strong and come out
527,00:31:37.75,00:31:37.75,of this all right tonight. ...but I can guarantee...
528,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,>> Right. >> I can promise you that.
529,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,...either you or Cirie if we have to go to another Tribal
530,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"Council, and then whoever's left of that pass."
531,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,And I think we've got a better deal for you.
532,00:32:05.75,00:32:05.75,>> This vote today is crucial because the line will be drawn
533,00:32:08.71,00:32:08.71,"in the sand, and you'll be on one side or the other."
534,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,And I feel like I'm on the bottom of either alliance.
535,00:32:15.33,00:32:15.33,"So I'm, like, ""Which way ""do I go?"
536,00:32:17.79,00:32:17.79,"Which way is it worse?"" I don't know."
537,00:32:20.04,00:32:20.04,"I'm really not in a good position anyways, you know"
538,00:32:22.67,00:32:22.67,what I mean? >> I think you're in
539,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,the position. I think you're the swing
540,00:32:26.12,00:32:26.12,"vote tonight. >> Everybody wants me to vote,"
541,00:32:27.75,00:32:27.75,"you know, one way tonight, but what about me down the road,"
542,00:32:31.83,00:32:31.83,you know? >> Right.
543,00:32:33.12,00:32:33.12,">> So, I mean, I really got to think what's best for me."
544,00:32:36.25,00:32:36.25,>> Yep. So one assurance that you would have: they all
545,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,go home before you ever go home. You're not gonna get that deal
546,00:32:44.33,00:32:44.33,on their side. >> Yeah.
547,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,>> I'm not even gonna ask you what you're gonna do.
548,00:32:48.79,00:32:48.79,You and Cirie are gonna have to decide if this is a move that
549,00:32:51.96,00:32:51.96,"makes sense to you. Tom, Colby, Stephenie are"
550,00:32:53.79,00:32:53.79,writing Amanda's name down. I'm trusting my gut on this.
551,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,"And I think you should trust your gut on this, too, and"
552,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,"see where it takes you. >> All right, so what's the"
553,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,deal? >> Tell me everything.
554,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,What's going on? >> I just want to do what's
555,00:33:14.04,00:33:14.04,"best, ultimately best, for the long run, for now."
556,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"The problem with this decision is, once this decision is made,"
557,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,all the cards are out. >> I know you guys are all
558,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,"tight, and I don't know, like, any of you guys from before and"
559,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,"all that stuff, and, like... >> See that's the problem."
560,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,I don't know why everybody thinks we're so tight.
561,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,"Yeah, me and Amanda made it to the end, but Amanda chose"
562,00:33:36.38,00:33:36.38,Parvati over me. Amanda cost me a million
563,00:33:39.12,00:33:39.12,dollars. >> Mm-hmm.
564,00:33:41.21,00:33:41.21,">> So, it's not like that. >> I need somebody to... that I"
565,00:33:43.33,00:33:43.33,can trust. >> So do I.
566,00:33:45.29,00:33:45.29,">> And I don't really have anything else going for me,"
567,00:33:47.96,00:33:47.96,so... >> Hello.
568,00:33:49.96,00:33:49.96,">> I mean... I mean, you know... >> I think we have some common"
569,00:33:52.42,00:33:52.42,"denominators. >> So, who goes first?"
570,00:33:57.88,00:33:57.88,">> I don't know. Honestly, as long as it's not"
571,00:34:04.33,00:34:04.33,"us, it don't much matter to me. >> Hmm."
572,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,">> PROBST: J.T., the group of misfit Villains taking the"
573,00:34:43.92,00:34:43.92,Heroes to the cleaners. >> It's pretty embarrassing.
574,00:34:46.88,00:34:46.88,"You know, I stepped up today, and I didn't come through, you"
575,00:34:49.33,00:34:49.33,"know, so I feel kind of bad about that."
576,00:34:51.58,00:34:51.58,"But you know, no one was listening, and I noticed, you"
577,00:34:53.75,00:34:53.75,"know, the Villains-- Boston Rob hollering, told everyone to shut"
578,00:34:56.08,00:34:56.08,"up, and you know, maybe I should have done that."
579,00:34:58.75,00:34:58.75,">> PROBST: James, you were as frustrated as I've seen you in"
580,00:35:01.75,00:35:01.75,playing this game three times. >> There only should have been
581,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,"one voice talking, and there wasn't, and I'm trying to make"
582,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,"sure everybody's being quiet, and there was a certain"
583,00:35:09.96,00:35:09.96,individual who voiced out their opinion that they were being
584,00:35:11.96,00:35:11.96,quiet. >> PROBST: So who was that?
585,00:35:13.96,00:35:13.96,">> Stephenie. I said, ""Everybody, shut up."""
586,00:35:15.79,00:35:15.79,"""Oh, I'm not talking."" ""Baby, I'm not talking to you."""
587,00:35:17.58,00:35:17.58,>> It was after the challenge was over.
588,00:35:19.42,00:35:19.42,">> Yes. >> You looked at me, and you"
589,00:35:21.29,00:35:21.29,"said, ""Hey, y'all."" >> Darlin', your name is not"
590,00:35:23.08,00:35:23.08,y'all. >> All right.
591,00:35:25.04,00:35:25.04,>> I'll be damned if anybody named y'all in here.
592,00:35:27.04,00:35:27.04,>> All right. All right. You're trying to blame this
593,00:35:30.17,00:35:30.17,"entire challenge on me? >> I'm not... You see, that's"
594,00:35:31.88,00:35:31.88,you. >> The challenge was over.
595,00:35:33.75,00:35:33.75,">> Baby, it's not about you. It's really not."
596,00:35:35.62,00:35:35.62,">> Okay, well, then move on. Move on from me."
597,00:35:37.38,00:35:37.38,">> No matter how much you want it to be, and how much you crave"
598,00:35:39.04,00:35:39.04,"it to be, darling... >> Here we go again. Oh, my God."
599,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,">> ...it's not about you. I was asked the question, and I"
600,00:35:42.92,00:35:42.92,"answered the question, and the person who tries to cover their"
601,00:35:44.62,00:35:44.62,back is usually the one who has to.
602,00:35:46.58,00:35:46.58,You've been on a tribe where you've lost your entire team.
603,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,"I don't want that to happen. Yeah, it was very romantic that"
604,00:35:50.04,00:35:50.04,you survived all your teammates on your tribe.
605,00:35:55.67,00:35:55.67,">> James, this isn't about me. >> This is a tribe of winners."
606,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,>> I thought we said it's not about me.
607,00:35:59.58,00:35:59.58,Can we get this rolling? It's not about me.
608,00:36:01.71,00:36:01.71,">> You wouldn't have said nothing, I would have still been"
609,00:36:03.67,00:36:03.67,"talking to y'all. >> James, you just attacked her."
610,00:36:05.88,00:36:05.88,>> I'm not attack... >> You expect her to sit here
611,00:36:07.88,00:36:07.88,and not defend herself? You just told Probst...
612,00:36:09.83,00:36:09.83,>> What she said? >> ...there was one person that
613,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,caused us such hell today. >> Exactly.
614,00:36:13.83,00:36:13.83,">> So you can not expect her to sit here and not defend herself,"
615,00:36:15.88,00:36:15.88,James. >> And I expect her to defend
616,00:36:17.83,00:36:17.83,"herself, and I... >> And you're continuing to"
617,00:36:19.88,00:36:19.88,attack her. Now you're getting back to her
618,00:36:21.83,00:36:21.83,"past season. Just let it be, bro."
619,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,>> The two of y'all-- how about that one?
620,00:36:25.83,00:36:25.83,Is that good enough? >> Make it the three of them
621,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,"all, okay? Alliances have been made,"
622,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,divisions have been cast in the tribe.
623,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,You repeating things and just bullying people until...
624,00:36:33.92,00:36:33.92,>> I'm not bullying people. >> ...until they back off...
625,00:36:35.92,00:36:35.92,>> You were bullying Stephenie. >> I was not...
626,00:36:37.96,00:36:37.96,">> Jeff asked who you were speaking about, and you said her"
627,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,name. That does mean her.
628,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,That doesn't mean y'all. That means Stephenie.
629,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,">> That's how it goes. If you walk up to somebody, and"
630,00:36:47.46,00:36:47.46,"they said, ""What? I wasn't doing nothing,"" usually they're doing"
631,00:36:49.92,00:36:49.92,"something. >> Maybe in your world, James."
632,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,I don't know. I don't live in your world.
633,00:36:53.79,00:36:53.79,Anyway... >> This is unbelievable.
634,00:36:56.88,00:36:56.88,">> PROBST: Colby, this has to be terribly alarming."
635,00:37:01.29,00:37:01.29,We're on day six. >> I had no idea it would shift
636,00:37:05.04,00:37:05.04,from that team mentality to the self-preservation this early.
637,00:37:11.46,00:37:11.46,">> PROBST: Stephenie, how concerned are you about past"
638,00:37:14.96,00:37:14.96,relationships in this game? Worried that it could work
639,00:37:18.50,00:37:18.50,against you that you played with Tom?
640,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,">> Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, we're friends, but"
641,00:37:24.79,00:37:24.79,"I played against him and merged with him, and he cut my throat"
642,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,"in the end. >> PROBST: Cirie, you, Amanda"
643,00:37:32.54,00:37:32.54,and James all played together. What do you do to deflect that?
644,00:37:36.96,00:37:36.96,">> Um, like Stephenie said, she played with Tom, and Tom cut her"
645,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,throat in the end. The same thing kind of happened
646,00:37:43.79,00:37:43.79,with me and Amanda at the very end.
647,00:37:45.92,00:37:45.92,Amanda chose Parvati over me. So if you think that's the route
648,00:37:50.33,00:37:50.33,"I would want to take again, obviously, you don't know me."
649,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,>> PROBST: Amanda how concerned are you that your past
650,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,relationships are gonna come back to haunt you?
651,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,">> Legitimately concerned, because, you know, I've been"
652,00:38:03.25,00:38:03.25,"hearing my name bounced around, and it's alarming."
653,00:38:06.04,00:38:06.04,"You know, you get really nervous."
654,00:38:08.38,00:38:08.38,"You just hope you make the right choices and the right alliances,"
655,00:38:12.04,00:38:12.04,"and then that's all you can do. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
656,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,"to vote. Rupert, you're up."
657,00:38:47.71,00:38:47.71,>> It's the plan. You're the weakest.
658,00:39:21.21,00:39:21.21,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
659,00:39:34.33,00:39:34.33,votes. >> PROBST: Once the votes are
660,00:39:44.92,00:39:44.92,"read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked"
661,00:39:47.46,00:39:47.46,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
662,00:39:49.75,00:39:49.75,I'll read the votes. First vote-- Steph.
663,00:39:59.71,00:39:59.71,"Amanda. One vote-- Steph, one vote--"
664,00:40:02.46,00:40:02.46,Amanda. Steph.
665,00:40:07.08,00:40:07.08,"That's two votes-- Steph, one vote-- Amanda."
666,00:40:11.54,00:40:11.54,Amanda. We're tied.
667,00:40:13.71,00:40:13.71,"Two votes-- Steph, two votes-- Amanda."
668,00:40:18.54,00:40:18.54,"Steph. That's three votes-- Steph, two"
669,00:40:21.00,00:40:21.00,votes-- Amanda. Amanda.
670,00:40:26.04,00:40:26.04,"Tied again. Three votes-- Steph, three"
671,00:40:28.42,00:40:28.42,votes-- Amanda. Steph.
672,00:40:33.92,00:40:33.92,"That's four votes-- Steph, three votes-- Amanda."
673,00:40:41.54,00:40:41.54,Second person voted out of Survivor: Heroes Vs.
674,00:40:44.12,00:40:44.12,Villains-- Stephenie. That's five. That's enough.
675,00:40:47.12,00:40:47.12,"Need to bring me your torch. Steph, the tribe has spoken."
676,00:40:58.12,00:40:58.12,">> Just some advice. Next time, y'all lose a"
677,00:41:00.42,00:41:00.42,"challenge, a little less cursing off your tribe might help."
678,00:41:04.21,00:41:04.21,">> Keep your mouth shut. >> Oh, come on."
679,00:41:08.54,00:41:08.54,">> It's been a pleasure. >> PROBST: Well, I think"
680,00:41:15.79,00:41:15.79,tonight's Tribal Council speaks for itself.
681,00:41:18.21,00:41:18.21,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
682,00:41:20.33,00:41:20.33,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
683,00:41:41.62,00:41:41.62,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on...
684,00:41:47.96,00:41:47.96,>> Go! >> PROBST: ...Survivor.
685,00:41:49.96,00:41:49.96,(groaning) >> Whup her ass!
686,00:41:52.21,00:41:52.21,">> Told you you were on the wrong team, James."
687,00:41:54.50,00:41:54.50,>> PROBST: A Hero spirals out of control.
688,00:41:57.50,00:41:57.50,">> James got to bring down nasty, brutish bullying."
689,00:42:03.17,00:42:03.17,>> It's an ugly situation. >> I am upset that I'm out of
690,00:42:12.62,00:42:12.62,the game. I take comfort in knowing that
691,00:42:15.50,00:42:15.50,they definitely made the wrong move by getting rid of me.
692,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,These people don't even genuinely try to get to know
693,00:42:21.17,00:42:21.17,each other. There was a division since day
694,00:42:23.17,00:42:23.17,one. I just definitely wanted to
695,00:42:25.12,00:42:25.12,stick around for a lot longer. A lot of people were really
696,00:42:27.12,00:42:27.12,threatened by me. I don't think there's anything
697,00:42:29.12,00:42:29.12,else I could have done.
