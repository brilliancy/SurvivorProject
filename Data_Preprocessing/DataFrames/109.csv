1,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,  JEFF PROBST: 16 Americans marooned   for 39 days
2,00:00:05.07,00:00:05.07, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:07.53,00:00:07.53,"  Separated into two tribes,    Tagi and Pagong,"
4,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,"  they competed against each other to remain on the island,"
5,00:00:14.47,00:00:14.47,  but now the tribes  have merged into one.
6,00:00:16.37,00:00:16.37," Rattana is the name,"
7,00:00:18.23,00:00:18.23,  and it is everyone for themselves.
8,00:00:20.23,00:00:20.23,"  Every third night,"
9,00:00:21.73,00:00:21.73,  the entire tribe will hike  deep into the jungle
10,00:00:24.43,00:00:24.43," to take part in the Tribal Council,"
11,00:00:26.67,00:00:26.67,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
12,00:00:29.67,00:00:29.67,"  In the end, one will remain"
13,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
14,00:00:39.40,00:00:39.40, Last week on Survivor:
15,00:00:41.73,00:00:41.73,"   Yeah, bait's gone."
16,00:00:43.80,00:00:43.80," JEFF:  Food was scarce,   rice was being rationed..."
17,00:00:47.27,00:00:47.27, So a can's only going to last us two days?
18,00:00:49.13,00:00:49.13,   They're eating that much.
19,00:00:50.20,00:00:50.20, JEFF:  And Rich was still
20,00:00:51.20,00:00:51.20, the only one providing fish.
21,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,  Rich is playing a big game.
22,00:00:54.93,00:00:54.93, JEFF:  And so is Greg--
23,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13, he cut   play-kitten Colleen loose.
24,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73, GREG: You look right  in the kitten's eye and snap
25,00:00:59.93,00:00:59.93,"its neck-- it's nothingpersonal, you're hungry."
26,00:01:02.13,00:01:02.13, JEFF:  And made a move on Rich.
27,00:01:03.90,00:01:03.90,   RICHARD: He's trying something.
28,00:01:03.90,00:01:03.90,  That's great.
29,00:01:06.10,00:01:06.10, JEFF: The reward challenge
30,00:01:07.23,00:01:07.23,  brought videos from home...
31,00:01:08.80,00:01:08.80,"   Hi, Daddy."
32,00:01:10.03,00:01:10.03,Baby.
33,00:01:11.23,00:01:11.23, JEFF:  Except for Jenna.
34,00:01:12.37,00:01:12.37,"  Oh, don't..."
35,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57,It would've done wonders to see
36,00:01:15.27,00:01:15.27, that my kids are okay.
37,00:01:17.10,00:01:17.10,GERVASE:  She's tugging on people's  emotions right there
38,00:01:19.23,00:01:19.23,  and that's a threat for me.
39,00:01:21.00,00:01:21.00, JEFF:  And at Tribal Council...
40,00:01:22.30,00:01:22.30, Is there an alliance?
41,00:01:23.33,00:01:23.33,  Do I have to answer?
42,00:01:24.33,00:01:24.33," No, I'm just kidding."
43,00:01:25.50,00:01:25.50,"No, no."
44,00:01:26.97,00:01:26.97," JEFF: Last week, Greg was voted off."
45,00:01:29.40,00:01:29.40, Eight castaways remain.
46,00:01:30.93,00:01:30.93, Who will be voted off tonight?
47,00:02:41.40,00:02:41.40,That was my deal--out of here.
48,00:02:45.23,00:02:45.23,"Well, I don't knowif they were..."
49,00:02:47.37,00:02:47.37,"RICHARD: Outright lying    is absolutely essential,"
50,00:02:49.37,00:02:49.37,  especially when you have
51,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"   a host like Jeff,who's as bold as to ask"
52,00:02:54.03,00:02:54.03,"""Well, so Sue, tell me,is there an alliance?"""
53,00:02:57.47,00:02:57.47,What a question.
54,00:03:01.50,00:03:01.50,   You think I'm going to come out and say
55,00:03:03.37,00:03:03.37,"  ""Oh, yeah, we got four of usvoting up against all you guys."
56,00:03:06.30,00:03:06.30,"  We're going to knock you all   down to the end."" Come on."
57,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,It won't bebad if you getin the water.
58,00:03:11.73,00:03:11.73,COLLEEN:  Those people flat out lied
59,00:03:14.13,00:03:14.13, in front of a national  television audience.
60,00:03:16.97,00:03:16.97," I mean,    they want a million bucks"
61,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43, and they're going to get it...
62,00:03:21.20,00:03:21.20,  And I loved Jeff's question
63,00:03:23.17,00:03:23.17,"  ""Is, uh, a deserving person   going to win this money?"""
64,00:03:25.73,00:03:25.73,"  The answer to that questionis ""no."""
65,00:03:27.63,00:03:27.63,"How you doing thismorning, Kelly?"
66,00:03:29.47,00:03:29.47,   I'm doing.
67,00:03:31.53,00:03:31.53, I didn't really sleep  last night.
68,00:03:33.07,00:03:33.07,No.
69,00:03:33.07,00:03:33.07,No?
70,00:03:34.90,00:03:34.90, KELLY:  This whole alliance thing  is getting too stupid
71,00:03:37.20,00:03:37.20, and too crazy.
72,00:03:38.43,00:03:38.43,"  If we stick with it,"
73,00:03:40.07,00:03:40.07,  it's just like lining lambs   to the slaughter.
74,00:03:42.10,00:03:42.10,"  Who goes next? Who goes...?  like, that's no fun."
75,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,I know.
76,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,"We were targetedalready, anyway."
77,00:03:46.63,00:03:46.63,"If we keepannoying themlike we are,"
78,00:03:48.47,00:03:48.47,we're going to begone really soon.
79,00:03:50.63,00:03:50.63," KELLY: Yeah, I don't like it."
80,00:03:52.13,00:03:52.13, I-I'm not happy playing   the game that way.
81,00:03:53.97,00:03:53.97,"  If I'm going to win,"
82,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,"   if I'm really going to be   the last survivor,"
83,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67," if I'm really going to survive  and really do this,"
84,00:04:00.07,00:04:00.07, then it has to be on my own.
85,00:04:27.27,00:04:27.27, SEAN:  Rich is definitely    in this very good
86,00:04:28.90,00:04:28.90,"strategic positionfor himself, I think."
87,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,"He's worked hard.Well, not that hard."
88,00:04:32.60,00:04:32.60,Just happens to be goodat spearfishing.
89,00:04:34.37,00:04:34.37,He doesn't do much else.
90,00:04:36.13,00:04:36.13, He sure don't do a damn thingaround here except fish.
91,00:04:39.67,00:04:39.67, SEAN: But he's a good sport.
92,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20," I mean, we call him all kinds of names and make fun of him."
93,00:04:43.83,00:04:43.83,I sort of liked himbefore I knew he was queer.
94,00:04:46.03,00:04:46.03,"Lost a prong to a good,five-foot nurse shark."
95,00:04:48.87,00:04:48.87,"I got to take themby hand from now on,like Tarzan-style--"
96,00:04:52.37,00:04:52.37,wrestle them.
97,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,"   He's in an ideal position, 'cause I think"
98,00:04:56.97,00:04:56.97,   he's the epicenterof the power right now.
99,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,   He's bringing in the fish.
100,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63,"Oh, my God."
101,00:05:03.40,00:05:03.40,  There's got to be 25 pounds  or 20 pounds of fish here.
102,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67,"It's all aboutthe fish, man."
103,00:05:09.00,00:05:09.00,"The fish don'tinfluence me, though."
104,00:05:10.43,00:05:10.43,  No?
105,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,Not in the least.
106,00:05:12.80,00:05:12.80,You can take the heavy-dutyequipment and I'll putz.
107,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,Okay.
108,00:05:16.43,00:05:16.43,'Cause I fed you today.
109,00:05:17.83,00:05:17.83,Yeah.
110,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40," SEAN:  I love Rich, I really do."
111,00:05:21.20,00:05:21.20," He's been a great asset  to this camp,"
112,00:05:23.03,00:05:23.03,  but he is a little immaturein his motives at times.
113,00:05:25.20,00:05:25.20,"You'll be so damn fullof protein after this meal,"
114,00:05:27.23,00:05:27.23,you won't knowwhat to do with yourself.
115,00:05:28.93,00:05:28.93,This is funny.
116,00:05:30.17,00:05:30.17,I am...
117,00:05:31.33,00:05:31.33,This man...
118,00:05:31.33,00:05:31.33,the master.
119,00:05:33.20,00:05:33.20,  He's very protective  about spearing fish
120,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,  and he brings it up    at every island council:
121,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70,"  ""I'm catching fish.   Don't vote me off."""
122,00:05:39.10,00:05:39.10,  It's an insecurity aspect to him.
123,00:05:40.23,00:05:40.23, The last island Tribal Council
124,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"when I was talking about, um..."
125,00:05:43.90,00:05:43.90,"  ""I'll be staying around here  because I'm providing fish"""
126,00:05:46.23,00:05:46.23,  was an outright blatant lie.
127,00:05:48.03,00:05:48.03,I'm staying around here   'cause I'm bright.
128,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,  It has nothing to do  with catching fish.
129,00:05:51.57,00:05:51.57,That is alot of fish.
130,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"RICHARD: Catching fish   makes people happy,"
131,00:05:55.37,00:05:55.37,  but that's not why
132,00:05:56.60,00:05:56.60,they're voting me here.
133,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,   They're not voting me off
134,00:06:00.07,00:06:00.07, because I'm not letting them.
135,00:06:03.73,00:06:03.73,SUSAN:Tell me ifI'm doing it...
136,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,like cuttingtoo much meat.
137,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,"RICHARD:No, you're doing pretty well."
138,00:06:09.20,00:06:09.20,Got it.
139,00:06:11.97,00:06:11.97,Now rip it out.
140,00:06:13.30,00:06:13.30,"I'm sorry, I can't..."
141,00:06:16.97,00:06:16.97,You wantto do one?
142,00:06:18.07,00:06:18.07,COLLEEN: Do you see them
143,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97,  bringing these stingrays
144,00:06:22.03,00:06:22.03, and stuff in?
145,00:06:23.30,00:06:23.30," They're, like, still flapping around"
146,00:06:24.80,00:06:24.80," and they take this dull knife,and chop off their head."
147,00:06:27.20,00:06:27.20,It's disgusting.
148,00:06:30.10,00:06:30.10,   ( loud slapping )
149,00:06:32.33,00:06:32.33,  If I choose
150,00:06:34.23,00:06:34.23,   to watch my dinner that came from the sea
151,00:06:36.07,00:06:36.07,"  be killed or not be killed,"
152,00:06:37.57,00:06:37.57,  I would rather not   watch it be killed.
153,00:06:42.20,00:06:42.20,"JENNA:Rich, you're the man."
154,00:06:43.63,00:06:43.63,You are the reef master.
155,00:06:54.93,00:06:54.93,"Yeah, there's some waterover here."
156,00:06:58.83,00:06:58.83,"JENNA:Oh, I'm solooking forward"
157,00:07:00.47,00:07:00.47,to this now.
158,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,I wouldn't even eat fish sticks.
159,00:07:03.63,00:07:03.63,SUSAN:I'm just hungry.
160,00:07:04.80,00:07:04.80,I could careless about that.
161,00:07:06.47,00:07:06.47,"  When Rich came in  with a fish,"
162,00:07:09.60,00:07:09.60,"  I said to Rudy, ""I should goand stoke that fire up."""
163,00:07:11.77,00:07:11.77,"  And Rudy's, like, ""Oh, no,   no, no, that's good enough."
164,00:07:14.47,00:07:14.47,"  It's hot enough,"""
165,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,   and it wasn't hot enough.
166,00:07:24.50,00:07:24.50,"RICHARD:Well, I would sayit's done, Rudy,"
167,00:07:26.47,00:07:26.47,   and black.
168,00:07:28.27,00:07:28.27,It curls upinto little balls.
169,00:07:29.53,00:07:29.53,I know.
170,00:07:30.80,00:07:30.80, SUSAN:  The fish is tough to cook
171,00:07:32.13,00:07:32.13,  because they cooked  a little bit
172,00:07:33.50,00:07:33.50,  and then they cooled off
173,00:07:34.73,00:07:34.73, and they had to startthe fire back up
174,00:07:36.53,00:07:36.53,"and cook the fish again, so Rich is sort of irritated."
175,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,  ( rhythmic tapping )
176,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,RICHARD: Rudy's clueless
177,00:07:43.47,00:07:43.47,"when it comes to fish, and, um,  you know, really ruined it."
178,00:07:48.07,00:07:48.07,You ready?
179,00:07:49.07,00:07:49.07,Yep.
180,00:07:52.13,00:07:52.13,RICHARD: Nobody knew what to do  with cooking the fish
181,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,  and so it sits here
182,00:07:56.57,00:07:56.57," and it sits half on the heat, and it sits over there"
183,00:07:58.50,00:07:58.50,"and it gets turned overhalfway and it doesn't,"
184,00:08:00.30,00:08:00.30, and so it's half-cooked and overcooked and undercooked
185,00:08:02.90,00:08:02.90," and half of the fish, half of the three rays"
186,00:08:06.40,00:08:06.40, were wasted...and that infuriates me.
187,00:08:11.23,00:08:11.23, It's overdone.
188,00:08:12.23,00:08:12.23, It's charcoal.
189,00:08:13.23,00:08:13.23,Its wings are curled up.
190,00:08:14.97,00:08:14.97,"  It's very, very easy to put a fire together"
191,00:08:17.77,00:08:17.77,  that's nice and hot.
192,00:08:19.13,00:08:19.13,Just 'cause I seehow to do that
193,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,"doesn't mean anybody elseshould know how, so..."
194,00:08:23.73,00:08:23.73,"  I was sitting there, just pissed off, really frustrated."
195,00:08:25.93,00:08:25.93,  I don't want anybody around
196,00:08:27.47,00:08:27.47," I don't want anybody near me  when I'm frustrated,"
197,00:08:29.13,00:08:29.13," and people are sitting there,""What's wrong?"""
198,00:08:30.83,00:08:30.83, and that just makes it worse.
199,00:08:32.03,00:08:32.03,GERVASE:Don't be hardon yourself.
200,00:08:33.67,00:08:33.67,  Huh?
201,00:08:35.03,00:08:35.03,  Just take it easy-- let us be hard on you.
202,00:08:36.57,00:08:36.57," Okay. Go for it, dude."
203,00:08:38.87,00:08:38.87,"GERVASE:Don't you know howa fire works, man?"
204,00:08:40.73,00:08:40.73,"RICHARD:Uh-huh, I do..."
205,00:08:42.30,00:08:42.30,"   and I'm not really patientabout teaching anybody,"
206,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,   so I'm just going  to do it myself from now on.
207,00:08:47.13,00:08:47.13,"  I probably won't get fish, actually, for a little while now,"
208,00:08:49.13,00:08:49.13,"  anyway, because they need    to appreciate it."
209,00:08:51.37,00:08:51.37,  I'm bringing in too many   right now.
210,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67, I brought in a bunch yesterday    and a bunch today
211,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,and so we needto take a break
212,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,  and let them kind of hunger for it again.
213,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,"COLLEEN:  So many times Rich opens   his mouth,"
214,00:09:00.53,00:09:00.53," and I just want to be, like,"
215,00:09:01.90,00:09:01.90,"""Oh, be quiet over there in the corner."
216,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67," ""You're not making any sense, and you think you're so smart"
217,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,"  ""and you're... just go home,  and go get your liposuction"
218,00:09:09.80,00:09:09.80,"and go catch more fish,   'cause you're bugging me."""
219,00:09:12.37,00:09:12.37,"  You know, he thinkshe's so above everybody"
220,00:09:14.80,00:09:14.80,"and is full of baloney, really."
221,00:09:16.90,00:09:16.90,"RICHARD:  Pathetic, burnt, overdone"
222,00:09:18.77,00:09:18.77,wasteful again.
223,00:09:20.97,00:09:20.97,   Amazes me.
224,00:09:42.23,00:09:42.23, KELLY:  The hardest part now is...
225,00:09:44.77,00:09:44.77,   ( sighs )
226,00:09:45.77,00:09:45.77, ...the food.
227,00:09:46.93,00:09:46.93,  We're hungry
228,00:09:48.20,00:09:48.20,and Rich is the only one that can fish.
229,00:09:53.10,00:09:53.10,   You got to go out  an hour before it gets dark
230,00:09:55.20,00:09:55.20,"   and then, right at   when it was getting dark,"
231,00:09:56.97,00:09:56.97,  we started getting our bites
232,00:09:58.57,00:09:58.57,"  and then, after it got dark,  we didn't get no more bites."
233,00:10:01.30,00:10:01.30,   We've gone fishingin the morning.
234,00:10:02.77,00:10:02.77, We've gone in the afternoon...   at night.
235,00:10:04.43,00:10:04.43,  We're not catching any fish.
236,00:10:05.90,00:10:05.90,SUSAN:I'm gettingto the point
237,00:10:07.30,00:10:07.30,if there ain'tno crabs out there
238,00:10:08.87,00:10:08.87,"in a day or two,I ain't gonna to do it no more."
239,00:10:12.23,00:10:12.23," It bothers me that I can't get my own food,"
240,00:10:14.43,00:10:14.43,  that I have to relyon someone else.
241,00:10:16.07,00:10:16.07," Ooh, big fish."
242,00:10:17.23,00:10:17.23,"Oh, wow!"
243,00:10:20.63,00:10:20.63,"We got a fish, you guys, right?"
244,00:10:22.47,00:10:22.47," It's a fish, for sure."
245,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67, Whoo!
246,00:10:25.50,00:10:25.50,  That's so awesome.  Look at that thing.
247,00:10:26.97,00:10:26.97,He's pretty big.
248,00:10:28.03,00:10:28.03, Fish!
249,00:10:29.87,00:10:29.87, Bloop.
250,00:10:31.63,00:10:31.63, SUSAN:   Good proof   that we can get the fish.
251,00:10:33.63,00:10:33.63,"We caught a fish today,finally-- yes!--"
252,00:10:37.10,00:10:37.10, and it feels so good.
253,00:10:38.73,00:10:38.73,  I feel so accomplished now.
254,00:10:43.57,00:10:43.57," JENNA: I think, uh,  it disappointed Rich"
255,00:10:46.87,00:10:46.87, that us girls  kept these crab traps going
256,00:10:48.70,00:10:48.70,   and that we caught a fish.
257,00:10:49.90,00:10:49.90,That's good.
258,00:10:53.07,00:10:53.07,  He's going to make   a big point
259,00:10:54.90,00:10:54.90," ""Oh, that ain't a lot  to feed you,"""
260,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,but it's a point that we did catch it.
261,00:10:58.40,00:10:58.40,"  So, I don't give a ( blip )about how he's going to see it."
262,00:11:01.10,00:11:01.10, We caught it;  I feel accomplished.
263,00:11:02.40,00:11:02.40, We've done it all now.
264,00:11:03.50,00:11:03.50,"We got a fish, man,a edible fish."
265,00:11:05.37,00:11:05.37,I ain't kidding you.
266,00:11:07.03,00:11:07.03,RUDY:Big one?
267,00:11:08.33,00:11:08.33,"SUSAN:Yeah, prettynice size."
268,00:11:10.60,00:11:10.60,RUDY:Is he kicking?
269,00:11:11.97,00:11:11.97,"Yeah, he'sstill alive."
270,00:11:13.23,00:11:13.23,"Yeah, he's still alive."
271,00:11:14.40,00:11:14.40,"Yeah, that's a good one."
272,00:11:15.73,00:11:15.73,I know it.
273,00:11:17.37,00:11:17.37,"SUSAN:  But, yeah,   he's going to be..."
274,00:11:19.00,00:11:19.00, I think it might bother him.
275,00:11:20.90,00:11:20.90,"   In a way, I hope it does."
276,00:11:22.70,00:11:22.70,"  I hope it bugs him,  'cause now he can't"
277,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,"  say that no more, you know?"
278,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03,  'Cause us girls    caught this one.
279,00:11:36.13,00:11:36.13,  ( buzzing )
280,00:11:55.00,00:11:55.00,"Oh, wow."
281,00:11:56.77,00:11:56.77,  I love getting mail
282,00:11:57.87,00:11:57.87,  and there was a log hanging
283,00:11:59.13,00:11:59.13,  above our mailbox.
284,00:12:00.83,00:12:00.83,"  It looked an awful lot like    part of the tree,"
285,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,"  but when I took it down,    there was a sign on there"
286,00:12:04.63,00:12:04.63,"   a little a nursery rhyme,it says:"

299,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,"I thought today,   we'd switch it up a little"

325,00:13:22.80,00:13:22.80,GERVASE: I was shaking  when I saw the food.
326,00:13:25.37,00:13:25.37,"I started shakingbecause I'm, like,""That's real chicken."""
327,00:13:27.93,00:13:27.93,Now think about thatand then think about rice.

475,00:20:11.93,00:20:11.93, by taking off   all of his clothes
476,00:20:13.90,00:20:13.90, and celebrating in his birthday suit...
477,00:20:19.47,00:20:19.47,  which you never get used
478,00:20:21.03,00:20:21.03,to seeing Richard naked.

482,00:20:32.03,00:20:32.03, for quite a long timeto celebrate my birthday naked.
483,00:20:36.23,00:20:36.23,"   And I'm sure he does love  to be naked,"
484,00:20:37.93,00:20:37.93, and I'm glad for that

486,00:20:42.57,00:20:42.57, but sitting at the fire  this morning
487,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13, and he comes just walking up
488,00:20:45.77,00:20:45.77," and sits, like,   two inches from me"
489,00:20:47.33,00:20:47.33,naked...
490,00:20:49.30,00:20:49.30, I wanted to get away.

493,00:20:53.70,00:20:53.70,I'm just having a problemwith this nakedness.
494,00:20:56.03,00:20:56.03,"It felt awkwardsitting next to a naked gay man,"
495,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17," and if he had, like, something  to cover the butt crack area"
496,00:21:01.23,00:21:01.23, I'd be cool with that.

506,00:21:20.33,00:21:20.33,  It's goofy.
507,00:21:21.33,00:21:21.33,  Who walks around naked 24/7?
508,00:21:23.00,00:21:23.00,I think you were doingit for shock value.

510,00:21:26.30,00:21:26.30,   Is it shock value?
511,00:21:27.63,00:21:27.63,  I don't know  if it's shock value or not.
512,00:21:29.43,00:21:29.43,  Colleen was particularlyuncomfortable with my nakedness

611,00:24:29.87,00:24:29.87,"   ""If you want to be heard,   speak up,"
612,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,"and if you want  to be appreciated, shut up."""
613,00:24:34.43,00:24:34.43,I'm just going to stayin alphabetical order.
614,00:24:37.00,00:24:37.00,  It's all I can do.
615,00:24:58.00,00:24:58.00,"  We've testedyour physical strength,"
616,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57," your swimming ability, your agility,"
617,00:25:01.23,00:25:01.23,your speed... all that.
618,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,  Today is something  a little different.
619,00:25:04.03,00:25:04.03,"  It's up here, in your head."
620,00:25:05.17,00:25:05.17,This is a gamethat requires strategy.
621,00:25:06.73,00:25:06.73,"It's a lot like chess,a little bit"
622,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,"   like tic-tac-toe,"
623,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,"   but unlike chess,where you're taking one person,"
624,00:25:11.97,00:25:11.97,you've got seven peopleto think about.
625,00:25:14.13,00:25:14.13,The way the game works isyou'll start on a square
626,00:25:17.17,00:25:17.17,"   and you'll simply,one at a time, on my cue"
627,00:25:19.07,00:25:19.07,"move to another square,"
628,00:25:20.33,00:25:20.33,turning the square over  behind you.
629,00:25:21.87,00:25:21.87,As longas you can keep stepping
630,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73,"to another square,you're still alive,"
631,00:25:25.97,00:25:25.97,but when you run out
632,00:25:27.23,00:25:27.23,"of red squaresto step on, you're out."
633,00:25:29.60,00:25:29.60,"So now, if you just flip overthese squares here,"
634,00:25:32.93,00:25:32.93,we'll determinethe order.
635,00:25:34.43,00:25:34.43,"Oh, yeah, baby."
636,00:25:35.43,00:25:35.43,"Oh, yes."
637,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27," Now, in any particular order,"
638,00:25:39.03,00:25:39.03,  step on one of the flower squares.
639,00:25:40.73,00:25:40.73,It does not matter.
640,00:25:41.77,00:25:41.77,These are all evenwhen you begin.
641,00:25:45.43,00:25:45.43,"   So, Rich, you're up first."
642,00:25:50.37,00:25:50.37, Perfect. Rudy.
643,00:25:53.73,00:25:53.73,Sean.
644,00:25:57.83,00:25:57.83,"Gervase, to you."
645,00:26:03.50,00:26:03.50,Sue.
646,00:26:07.80,00:26:07.80,Colleen.
647,00:26:11.33,00:26:11.33, Kelly.

650,00:26:32.73,00:26:32.73,Colleen.
651,00:26:34.93,00:26:34.93,Colleen.
652,00:26:35.93,00:26:35.93,Yeah... I'm out!
653,00:26:36.93,00:26:36.93,JEFF:Take a step back
654,00:26:38.67,00:26:38.67,and flipthat one over.
655,00:26:40.67,00:26:40.67,There you go.
656,00:26:41.87,00:26:41.87,Take a seaton the log.
657,00:26:43.40,00:26:43.40,That full mealhas got you...
658,00:26:45.37,00:26:45.37,sated.
659,00:26:47.37,00:26:47.37,  All right... Kelly.
660,00:26:54.00,00:26:54.00,   Jenna-- out on the island  by herself.
661,00:27:01.13,00:27:01.13,Kelly.
662,00:27:02.97,00:27:02.97, SUSAN:Just had to get in the center.
663,00:27:04.37,00:27:04.37,"Looks like you're out,Kelly."
664,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73,  Just doing my part.
665,00:27:06.73,00:27:06.73,JEFF:Join Colleenover there.
666,00:27:08.30,00:27:08.30,Jenna.
667,00:27:12.20,00:27:12.20,Rich.
668,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,I'm out.
669,00:27:17.23,00:27:17.23,"Sue, you're out."
670,00:27:19.37,00:27:19.37,   All right.
671,00:27:20.90,00:27:20.90, Jenna.
672,00:27:25.07,00:27:25.07,"Sean, you foiled my plan."
673,00:27:27.13,00:27:27.13,"SEAN:Sorry, baby."
674,00:27:28.47,00:27:28.47,"Was that yourplan, Sean?"
675,00:27:30.03,00:27:30.03,"No. Well, yeah, once shegot behind me, yeah, yeah."
676,00:27:32.97,00:27:32.97,To block her?
677,00:27:34.63,00:27:34.63, Rich.
678,00:27:36.17,00:27:36.17,"You need to worryabout yourself, Hatch."
679,00:27:38.30,00:27:38.30,"No, there's nothingI can do."
680,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17," I'm whimpering   into nowhere-land, here..."
681,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,Rudy.
682,00:27:43.57,00:27:43.57,Slowlydying...
683,00:27:44.63,00:27:44.63,the wise old manis looking good.
684,00:27:46.93,00:27:46.93,Sean.
685,00:27:47.93,00:27:47.93,"Oh, no, Sean,no, Sean."
686,00:27:49.63,00:27:49.63,"Don't you knowyou're dead, Sean?"
687,00:27:51.30,00:27:51.30,You're ruining it.
688,00:27:52.37,00:27:52.37,You got 50 million.
689,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,"She won't last, Sean."
690,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,Rudy will last longer.
691,00:27:57.43,00:27:57.43,He'll have to kill me.
692,00:27:58.77,00:27:58.77,"Otherwise, I couldhave bebopped around."
693,00:28:00.53,00:28:00.53,Sorry. I'm doing what I think is right.
694,00:28:02.70,00:28:02.70,"  Oh, Sean..."
695,00:28:02.70,00:28:02.70,JEFF:Gervase.
696,00:28:03.97,00:28:03.97,"Bad move, Sean."
697,00:28:05.37,00:28:05.37,   You could have gotten Rudy out of there.
698,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,"No, hecouldn't have."
699,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,"Yes, he could have."
700,00:28:09.03,00:28:09.03,"All right, Rich."
701,00:28:12.27,00:28:12.27,Rudy.
702,00:28:13.43,00:28:13.43,Rudy has manymore options.
703,00:28:15.03,00:28:15.03,Down there.
704,00:28:16.07,00:28:16.07,   He's doing right.
705,00:28:17.10,00:28:17.10,You should'vediagonal so...
706,00:28:18.90,00:28:18.90,"Don't listento her, Rudy."
707,00:28:20.57,00:28:20.57,"She's trying totrick you, Rudy."
708,00:28:22.70,00:28:22.70,Shut up.I am not.
709,00:28:23.73,00:28:23.73,"It's those young girls,Rudy,"
710,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,trying to getin your head.
711,00:28:26.60,00:28:26.60,"Stay strong,Rudy."
712,00:28:31.43,00:28:31.43,JENNA:Is it my turn?
713,00:28:33.77,00:28:33.77,Gervase.
714,00:28:37.60,00:28:37.60,Still alive.
715,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"Jenna, you,unfortunately,are not."
716,00:28:40.83,00:28:40.83,You're out.
717,00:28:42.90,00:28:42.90,I figuredyou are.

721,00:28:49.00,00:28:49.00,Bye!
722,00:28:50.93,00:28:50.93,"Rudy, it's downto you three"
723,00:28:53.30,00:28:53.30,for immunity fromtonight's vote.
724,00:28:55.83,00:28:55.83,"Go sidewards!Go left, Rudy, go left!"
725,00:28:57.93,00:28:57.93,GERVASE:  No coaching from the side.
726,00:28:59.63,00:28:59.63,"  No, no, no. Directly to your left."
727,00:29:01.07,00:29:01.07,"GERVASE:To the right, Rudy!"
728,00:29:02.20,00:29:02.20,Take... take...
729,00:29:03.43,00:29:03.43,"No, left, Rudy,"

731,00:29:06.33,00:29:06.33," Up to the right, Rudy."
732,00:29:07.50,00:29:07.50,   She's trying to trick you.
733,00:29:08.83,00:29:08.83,"No, no, no,no, buddy."
734,00:29:10.07,00:29:10.07,This one.
735,00:29:11.47,00:29:11.47,"Yeah, thereyou go."
736,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,"Good job, Rudy."
737,00:29:14.93,00:29:14.93,Gervase.
738,00:29:18.50,00:29:18.50,   Ain't gonna work.
739,00:29:20.20,00:29:20.20,"You've won, Rudy,if you take that path."
740,00:29:22.13,00:29:22.13,"SUSAN:If you go at adiagonal across,"
741,00:29:23.93,00:29:23.93,you got more squaresthan him to land on.
742,00:29:25.67,00:29:25.67,JENNA:You've got more squares left.
743,00:29:27.23,00:29:27.23,There you go!
744,00:29:28.40,00:29:28.40, SUSAN: There you go.
745,00:29:29.73,00:29:29.73,"Yeah, now you'reheading up to the beach."
746,00:29:34.93,00:29:34.93,I think it'sa foregoneconclusion.
747,00:29:36.30,00:29:36.30,( sighs )
748,00:29:38.60,00:29:38.60,"Flip that over,Gervase."

756,00:29:54.37,00:29:54.37,Take the honor offlipping the rest
757,00:29:56.80,00:29:56.80, of these over for me.
758,00:30:35.57,00:30:35.57,  ( buzzing )
759,00:30:37.30,00:30:37.30,Tonight's goingto be interesting.
760,00:30:38.77,00:30:38.77,"Oh, yeah?"
761,00:30:40.50,00:30:40.50," SUSAN:  Really, when they first got here,"
762,00:30:41.93,00:30:41.93,they were really ambitious.
763,00:30:43.13,00:30:43.13,Now you can seetheir ambition's
764,00:30:44.47,00:30:44.47,"kind of, like,filtering a little bit."
765,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23," If I feel like sitting in a hammock all day,"
766,00:30:48.13,00:30:48.13,I'm going to sit in a hammock all day.
767,00:30:49.70,00:30:49.70,I'm not goingto stop you.
768,00:30:50.83,00:30:50.83,No.
769,00:30:52.00,00:30:52.00,"COLLEEN: We had fun, you know?"
770,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,"  We had-- Pagong was a good,   was a good place to live."
771,00:30:58.10,00:30:58.10,  Now we moved   into the new neighborhood
772,00:31:00.67,00:31:00.67,   with the nasty neighbors.
773,00:31:02.47,00:31:02.47,  ( grunting )
774,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,SUSAN:I want to go over
775,00:31:05.53,00:31:05.53,in my house forawhile and bitch.
776,00:31:07.63,00:31:07.63,COLLEEN: Then we came in here
777,00:31:09.80,00:31:09.80,"like, ""Maybe we canall be friends"""
778,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,"and they came in, like,""We can smash 'em."""
779,00:31:13.30,00:31:13.30,"Yes, they did."
780,00:31:15.20,00:31:15.20,COLLEEN:The people who came in swinging   were Rich and Sue.
781,00:31:17.77,00:31:17.77,  They knew.
782,00:31:18.77,00:31:18.77, They're smart.
783,00:31:19.77,00:31:19.77,  They're very smart people...
784,00:31:21.77,00:31:21.77, Although Richis just a numbskull. God!
785,00:31:24.40,00:31:24.40,"RICHARD:All you 16, 15 weirdoesare making me nutty."
786,00:31:27.60,00:31:27.60,  I'm losing my mind.
787,00:31:29.07,00:31:29.07,COLLEEN: People are wishy-washy.
788,00:31:30.97,00:31:30.97,"   They're conniving  and they're stupid,"
789,00:31:32.93,00:31:32.93,"  and that's what's happening,"
790,00:31:34.70,00:31:34.70,  and it's all out in the open for everybody to see.
791,00:31:37.73,00:31:37.73, The decision  that I feel I'm left with is
792,00:31:41.73,00:31:41.73," do I interact   with these people, have fun"
793,00:31:44.30,00:31:44.30, and just wait till my ticket comes up
794,00:31:46.57,00:31:46.57,  or do I try and strategize and try and make a difference?
795,00:31:50.03,00:31:50.03,It's so sad now.
796,00:31:51.27,00:31:51.27,"You know, we just wait,you know?"
797,00:31:53.73,00:31:53.73,Unless...
798,00:31:54.73,00:31:54.73, we think of something.
799,00:31:56.23,00:31:56.23, ( whistling )
800,00:31:58.87,00:31:58.87,"   Yesterday, at the dinner,"
801,00:32:00.10,00:32:00.10,  we had a whole conversation
802,00:32:01.40,00:32:01.40, about forming a new alliance.
803,00:32:03.00,00:32:03.00,"Yeah, shh..."
804,00:32:04.07,00:32:04.07, We're going to vote the same
805,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,"and we figure that this puts us in jeopardy for the next one,"
806,00:32:10.03,00:32:10.03,"  but we were   in jeopardy anyway, so..."
807,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,"GERVASE: Well, we tried    the ""be nice, honor"" way."
808,00:32:14.13,00:32:14.13," It didn't work,   so don't be stupid anymore."
809,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67," It's just, we're smarter now."
810,00:32:18.27,00:32:18.27,"  We saw that that way didn't work,"
811,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,   so we got to switch gears.
812,00:32:33.33,00:32:33.33,COLLEEN:  What if I
813,00:32:34.53,00:32:34.53,just had thisas a skirt?
814,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,"   Oh, that's killer!"
815,00:32:39.43,00:32:39.43,GERVASE:I don't thinkmodels even wear
816,00:32:41.87,00:32:41.87,skirts that short.
817,00:32:43.90,00:32:43.90,"JENNA:Go for it, Colleen!Wear it!"
818,00:32:48.87,00:32:48.87,"  Not doing that, Sue?"
819,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67," Jenna and I were just,"
820,00:32:52.80,00:32:52.80," you know, goofing off"
821,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17," and, uh, Kelly decided   to join in."
822,00:32:56.93,00:32:56.93, I feel bad for Kelly   because she wants to play.
823,00:32:59.13,00:32:59.13,"  And Rich is, like,  ""Something's happened to you"
824,00:33:01.43,00:33:01.43,"  ""since these girls came."
825,00:33:02.57,00:33:02.57," I'm really worried about you,"""
826,00:33:04.23,00:33:04.23,kind of putting her in her place
827,00:33:06.17,00:33:06.17,   and makes her feel
828,00:33:07.20,00:33:07.20,  a little self-conscious.
829,00:33:08.77,00:33:08.77, By her being nervous
830,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,"and wishy-washy about where her loyalties lie,"
831,00:33:13.10,00:33:13.10,   it's really making Sue and Rich nervous.
832,00:33:15.00,00:33:15.00,You're young.
833,00:33:16.00,00:33:16.00,You hung outwith the chicks.
834,00:33:17.23,00:33:17.23,There's more Pagong membersthan Tagi members
835,00:33:19.13,00:33:19.13,and the Pagong members...
836,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,Pagong members don'tlike any of us.
837,00:33:21.77,00:33:21.77,They like you a lot betterthan any of us.
838,00:33:23.63,00:33:23.63,  Kelly's acting a little odd.
839,00:33:26.00,00:33:26.00,"  She's dressing likethe other two that are her age,"
840,00:33:29.57,00:33:29.57, and I'm hoping
841,00:33:30.83,00:33:30.83," that Kelly hasn't, uh, shifted trust"
842,00:33:33.10,00:33:33.10, and-and joined forces  with somebody else.
843,00:33:35.70,00:33:35.70,All them girlsare dressed the same today.
844,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00," SEAN: Yeah, they're dressing like, uh, superheroes."
845,00:33:40.33,00:33:40.33, RUDY:  Like who?
846,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33, Superheroes.
847,00:33:44.17,00:33:44.17,They were dancing around herea little while ago.
848,00:33:46.70,00:33:46.70,It looked likethe third grade.
849,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,  I thought about a female alliance
850,00:33:50.47,00:33:50.47,"  and watching them,"
851,00:33:51.93,00:33:51.93,"  the way they walk around,  hand in hand."
852,00:33:54.07,00:33:54.07,"I even thought about lesbianism,  but, uh, maybe not."
853,00:33:57.57,00:33:57.57, I don't know.
854,00:33:58.93,00:33:58.93,"And, uh, it could happenif they had any brains,"
855,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,   but I don't think they got   enough brains to do that.
856,00:34:04.67,00:34:04.67,"  I move objects with my mind,"
857,00:34:06.43,00:34:06.43, but only I can see it.
858,00:34:07.90,00:34:07.90, KELLY: I probably will have
859,00:34:09.57,00:34:09.57,the swing vote tonight.
860,00:34:11.20,00:34:11.20,"  I'd said before, you know,    alliance or no alliance,"
861,00:34:13.77,00:34:13.77, there's two people that I have   in mind to vote off
862,00:34:16.07,00:34:16.07," and they're two people that,    um, are-are competition,"
863,00:34:18.60,00:34:18.60," but, um, they annoy me"
864,00:34:21.47,00:34:21.47,  and... ( chuckling )
865,00:34:22.80,00:34:22.80, they're kind of sucky to live with.
866,00:34:32.60,00:34:32.60,"Let's roll, Gervase."
867,00:34:33.87,00:34:33.87,Get out of here.
868,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,COLLEEN:  I really don't know what's going to happen
869,00:34:44.03,00:34:44.03,  at Tribal Council tonight.
870,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,  I know I'm voting for Rich.
871,00:34:46.97,00:34:46.97,I know Jenna's voting for Rich.
872,00:34:48.97,00:34:48.97, I know Gervase  is voting for Rich.
873,00:34:50.77,00:34:50.77,"GERVASE: As long as he's catching fish,"
874,00:34:54.00,00:34:54.00,"  people are gonna try  to keep him around,"
875,00:34:55.77,00:34:55.77,"   so I say, get rid of Rich  and we all starve together."
876,00:34:58.20,00:34:58.20," JENNA:  The rest of my alliance,"
877,00:35:00.37,00:35:00.37, if that's what  you want to call it?
878,00:35:02.10,00:35:02.10,"Yeah, we're all voting for Rich."
879,00:35:04.20,00:35:04.20, He's ruthless
880,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80, and the fact that we're voting   him out on his birthday--
881,00:35:09.07,00:35:09.07,  it's not lost on me.
882,00:35:10.53,00:35:10.53,  We're giving him   a birthday present.
883,00:35:12.70,00:35:12.70,"  Okay, let's do this, Brutus!"
884,00:35:14.53,00:35:14.53,Gotta go.
885,00:35:25.27,00:35:25.27, JEFF:  Today's immunity challenge saw wisdom and strategy
886,00:35:28.67,00:35:28.67,  outplay youth and strength.
887,00:35:30.70,00:35:30.70,  Tonight it's Rudy    who's safe from the vote
888,00:35:32.93,00:35:32.93, as the others contemplate their fate.
889,00:35:37.47,00:35:37.47,But this is not  the only vote on their mind.
890,00:35:40.20,00:35:40.20,"  Beginning tonight with Greg,all members voted off the island"
891,00:35:44.23,00:35:44.23,  will return to subsequent Tribal Councils
892,00:35:46.93,00:35:46.93,   as part of a jury.
893,00:35:48.00,00:35:48.00,  They will gather information
894,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83," for a very important decision,"
895,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,"  because, ultimately,these seven will decide"
896,00:35:54.73,00:35:54.73,"who, of the final two survivors,"
897,00:35:57.03,00:35:57.03,   leaves the island with the million-dollar prize.
898,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,   ( gong clanging )
899,00:36:27.07,00:36:27.07,You're back.
900,00:36:28.30,00:36:28.30,Tribal Councilnumber nine.
901,00:36:30.03,00:36:30.03,27 days you guyshave been here.
902,00:36:32.43,00:36:32.43,"At the lastTribal Council,we established"
903,00:36:34.63,00:36:34.63,"our core group of nine,  so from that"
904,00:36:37.87,00:36:37.87,two of you will makeit to the final vote.
905,00:36:39.80,00:36:39.80,The other seven
906,00:36:41.07,00:36:41.07,will form a jury thatwill really decide
907,00:36:43.47,00:36:43.47,that final vote.
908,00:36:44.93,00:36:44.93," Now, in order to make an informed decision,"
909,00:36:47.53,00:36:47.53,the jury needsinformation.
910,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,"So, beginning tonight, Gregwill be joining us here"
911,00:36:53.10,00:36:53.10,as part of the jury.
912,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,He's merely here
913,00:36:55.70,00:36:55.70,"to observe, gatherinformation"
914,00:36:57.63,00:36:57.63,that he'll basehis decision on
915,00:37:00.10,00:37:00.10,"and at each tribalcouncil, when somebodyelse is voted off,"
916,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70, they will return to join Greg.
917,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33," Happy birthday   to you, Mr. Hatch."
918,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67," Thanks, Jeff."
919,00:37:09.93,00:37:09.93,Something we talked about today.
920,00:37:11.43,00:37:11.43,You were going to spend the day in your birthday suit.
921,00:37:12.87,00:37:12.87," That was part of your original idea, anyway."
922,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,  Yep.
923,00:37:15.40,00:37:15.40,A couple of peoplevoiced concern
924,00:37:17.30,00:37:17.30,"that, uh, ""MaybeI don't like this."""
925,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"Well, I just enjoybeing nude."
926,00:37:21.10,00:37:21.10,I'm on a deserted island in themiddle of the South China Sea.
927,00:37:24.10,00:37:24.10," I thought, what better place?"
928,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67, What better place than to just hang out nude?
929,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,But it did make a coupleof people uncomfortable
930,00:37:30.03,00:37:30.03,"so I thought,""Why bother?"""
931,00:37:31.87,00:37:31.87, Sean. I got to ask you
932,00:37:33.87,00:37:33.87,about the alphabet thing.
933,00:37:35.67,00:37:35.67, The alphabet.
934,00:37:37.40,00:37:37.40,  Give me the rationale so I'mabsolutely clear on it.
935,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,The rationaleis many-fold.
936,00:37:41.43,00:37:41.43,"First of all,it gives me an order"
937,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,that I can followpretty easily--
938,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,that's always nice.
939,00:37:44.73,00:37:44.73,And it is strategic.
940,00:37:45.97,00:37:45.97,"If you look at the order,the actual alphabet,"
941,00:37:47.90,00:37:47.90,"a lot of the Pagong peoplein the beginning,"
942,00:37:49.20,00:37:49.20,a lot of Tagi peoplein the end.
943,00:37:50.20,00:37:50.20,This tortures me.
944,00:37:51.27,00:37:51.27,Every three days. I hate it.
945,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17," Jenna, what's   your take on that?"
946,00:37:55.13,00:37:55.13,I'm next.
947,00:37:56.23,00:37:56.23,I'm today.
948,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,That's true.
949,00:37:58.37,00:37:58.37,"Yes. I'm ""J."""
950,00:37:59.67,00:37:59.67,"  That's, that's cool."
951,00:38:01.67,00:38:01.67,She knows she wouldn'ttake it personally
952,00:38:03.43,00:38:03.43,and I thinkshe's a safe vote tonight.
953,00:38:05.10,00:38:05.10,"If I was... feltshe was in jeopardy,"
954,00:38:06.93,00:38:06.93,  I would think twice   at the very least
955,00:38:09.20,00:38:09.20,   of casting a vote.
956,00:38:10.20,00:38:10.20,"Sue, what's yourtake on that"
957,00:38:11.60,00:38:11.60,as somebody whomight come up soon
958,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,in the alphabetand get a vote
959,00:38:14.63,00:38:14.63,against youeven if Sean
960,00:38:16.10,00:38:16.10,thinks you're thegreatest person here?
961,00:38:18.77,00:38:18.77,"Oh, Sean just... he's neurotic."
962,00:38:20.90,00:38:20.90,"   He's just, he's an idiot."
963,00:38:22.73,00:38:22.73," SEAN:   Thanks a lot, Sue."
964,00:38:23.77,00:38:23.77,  Thank you very much.
965,00:38:25.07,00:38:25.07,"  It's like, wow, okay, so I'm next, you know?"
966,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,"That's the way he votes,that's the way he votes."
967,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,  I... I just think he just...
968,00:38:32.13,00:38:32.13,"   I don't know, that or he doesn't have"
969,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,enough balls to make a decision.
970,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,I don't havea malicious bone in my body
971,00:38:37.43,00:38:37.43,"and I think thatcasting a vote,"
972,00:38:39.30,00:38:39.30,it makes mefeel malicious.
973,00:38:40.90,00:38:40.90,I want to avoid it.
974,00:38:42.00,00:38:42.00,"Yeah, but you cameinto this knowing..."
975,00:38:43.93,00:38:43.93,knowing you were goingto have to do this.
976,00:38:46.03,00:38:46.03,"Me, I've changed my vote"
977,00:38:47.67,00:38:47.67,"   like, three times   within the last two hours."
978,00:38:49.87,00:38:49.87,"And now it's me, right?"
979,00:38:51.57,00:38:51.57,  ( laughing )
980,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,No. No.
981,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43, How important is Richard right now?
982,00:38:56.97,00:38:56.97, He seems to be the only guy--at least of who's left--
983,00:38:59.37,00:38:59.37,that's ableto catch fish.
984,00:39:01.13,00:39:01.13,No. We did today.
985,00:39:02.40,00:39:02.40,Trapped it.
986,00:39:04.97,00:39:04.97, We nailed a fish today  in the trap.
987,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,We have a bream.
988,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,They got a fish.
989,00:39:08.13,00:39:08.13, SUSAN:  We got a fish today.
990,00:39:09.43,00:39:09.43,A nice-sized fish.
991,00:39:10.70,00:39:10.70,I'm outta here.
992,00:39:11.73,00:39:11.73,We gave itto Richard for his birthday.
993,00:39:13.73,00:39:13.73,"All right, it'stime to vote."
994,00:39:15.67,00:39:15.67,Gervase.
995,00:39:30.97,00:39:30.97,   My vote's for Rich
996,00:39:32.27,00:39:32.27,"   because the longer Rich ison this island,"
997,00:39:34.20,00:39:34.20, the bigger of a threathe becomes to me
998,00:39:36.07,00:39:36.07,"  taking that million dollars,"
999,00:39:37.60,00:39:37.60,"  so I figureif I get rid of him now,"
1000,00:39:39.37,00:39:39.37,"  everybody else will be cake,   so, happy birthday, Rich."
1001,00:39:52.27,00:39:52.27,Eliminating a big mouth.
1002,00:40:06.30,00:40:06.30,"Continuing my alphabetic   strategy,"
1003,00:40:08.07,00:40:08.07,"  Jenna, you know I love you,  no offense to this."
1004,00:40:10.17,00:40:10.17,I hope you don't get voted off.
1005,00:40:11.83,00:40:11.83,I don't think...
1006,00:40:13.40,00:40:13.40, you might have one vote or two  votes or something like that
1007,00:40:16.17,00:40:16.17,"   but nothing major, I don't think. I hope."
1008,00:40:33.63,00:40:33.63,"  Fish or not, I think  he's getting near the point,"
1009,00:40:36.27,00:40:36.27, he's ready to go home.
1010,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,Even though it is his birthday.
1011,00:40:43.37,00:40:43.37,"JEFF:As always,your identity"
1012,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,"at Tribal Council is notedby your fire, your torch."
1013,00:40:48.10,00:40:48.10,Directly across from you
1014,00:40:49.77,00:40:49.77, are the eight torches
1015,00:40:51.30,00:40:51.30,   of the first eight people   voted off.
1016,00:40:53.20,00:40:53.20," Tonight, another torch will be  added to that group"
1017,00:40:55.77,00:40:55.77, and that person will join Greg next week as part of our jury.

1038,00:43:41.23,00:43:41.23,A cigar!
1039,00:43:44.90,00:43:44.90, Good news for Gervase.
1040,00:43:46.27,00:43:46.27,"  Hey, everybody, it's a boy!"
1041,00:43:49.47,00:43:49.47,"  Having left the alliance,"
1042,00:43:51.17,00:43:51.17,  will Kelly now vote  against them?
1043,00:43:52.60,00:43:52.60,You're seemingmore down.
1044,00:43:54.47,00:43:54.47," KELLY: And if I'm going to do something conniving and dirty,"
1045,00:43:57.40,00:43:57.40,  let's get Rich off.
1046,00:43:59.17,00:43:59.17,Me and Kelly aretaking him down.
1047,00:44:06.00,00:44:06.00,"Well, I had a good time."
1048,00:44:07.13,00:44:07.13,It was a great timeon the island.
1049,00:44:08.73,00:44:08.73, I felt like I was targeted tonight
1050,00:44:10.73,00:44:10.73, because they knew that
1051,00:44:11.97,00:44:11.97," Sean would vote for me alphabetically,"
1052,00:44:13.83,00:44:13.83, so they knew they'd get an easy off with me.
1053,00:44:15.97,00:44:15.97, They were more powerful because Pagong went into it
1054,00:44:18.43,00:44:18.43," a little naive, so, that's it."
1055,00:44:20.80,00:44:20.80," I had a really good time,"
1056,00:44:22.60,00:44:22.60,and no hard feelingsand nothing'staken personally.
