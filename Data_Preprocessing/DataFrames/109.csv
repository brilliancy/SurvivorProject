1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,  JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans marooned    for 39 days
3,00:00:05.07,00:00:05.07, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:07.53,00:00:07.53,"  Separated into two tribes,     Tagi and Pagong,"
5,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,"  they competed against each  other to remain on the island,"
6,00:00:14.47,00:00:14.47,  but now the tribes   have merged into one.
7,00:00:16.37,00:00:16.37," Rattana is the name,"
8,00:00:18.23,00:00:18.23,  and it is everyone  for themselves.
9,00:00:20.23,00:00:20.23,"  Every third night,"
10,00:00:21.73,00:00:21.73,  the entire tribe will hike   deep into the jungle
11,00:00:24.43,00:00:24.43," to take part  in the Tribal Council,"
12,00:00:26.67,00:00:26.67,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
13,00:00:29.67,00:00:29.67,"  In the end, one will remain"
14,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
15,00:00:39.40,00:00:39.40, Last week on Survivor:
16,00:00:41.73,00:00:41.73,"   Yeah, bait's gone."
17,00:00:43.80,00:00:43.80," JEFF:    Food was scarce,    rice was being rationed..."
18,00:00:47.27,00:00:47.27, So a can's only going  to last us two days?
19,00:00:49.13,00:00:49.13,   They're eating that much.
20,00:00:50.20,00:00:50.20, JEFF:   And Rich was still
21,00:00:51.20,00:00:51.20, the only one providing fish.
22,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,  Rich is playing a big game.
23,00:00:54.93,00:00:54.93, JEFF:    And so is Greg--
24,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13, he cut    play-kitten Colleen loose.
25,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73, GREG:  You look right   in the kitten's eye and snap
26,00:00:59.93,00:00:59.93,"its neck-- it's nothing personal, you're hungry."
27,00:01:02.13,00:01:02.13, JEFF:    And made a move on Rich.
28,00:01:03.90,00:01:03.90,   RICHARD:  He's trying something.
29,00:01:03.90,00:01:03.90,  That's great.
30,00:01:06.10,00:01:06.10, JEFF:  The reward challenge
31,00:01:07.23,00:01:07.23,  brought videos from home...
32,00:01:08.80,00:01:08.80,"   Hi, Daddy."
33,00:01:10.03,00:01:10.03,Baby.
34,00:01:11.23,00:01:11.23, JEFF:    Except for Jenna.
35,00:01:12.37,00:01:12.37,"  Oh, don't..."
36,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57,It would've done wonders to see
37,00:01:15.27,00:01:15.27, that my kids are okay.
38,00:01:17.10,00:01:17.10,GERVASE:    She's tugging on people's   emotions right there
39,00:01:19.23,00:01:19.23,  and that's a threat for me.
40,00:01:21.00,00:01:21.00, JEFF:    And at Tribal Council...
41,00:01:22.30,00:01:22.30, Is there an alliance?
42,00:01:23.33,00:01:23.33,  Do I have to answer?
43,00:01:24.33,00:01:24.33," No, I'm just kidding."
44,00:01:25.50,00:01:25.50,"No, no."
45,00:01:26.97,00:01:26.97," JEFF:  Last week, Greg was voted off."
46,00:01:29.40,00:01:29.40, Eight castaways remain.
47,00:01:30.93,00:01:30.93, Who will be voted off tonight?
48,00:02:41.40,00:02:41.40,That was my deal-- out of here.
49,00:02:45.23,00:02:45.23,"Well, I don't know if they were..."
50,00:02:47.37,00:02:47.37,"RICHARD:  Outright lying     is absolutely essential,"
51,00:02:49.37,00:02:49.37,  especially when you have
52,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"   a host like Jeff, who's as bold as to ask"
53,00:02:54.03,00:02:54.03,"""Well, so Sue, tell me, is there an alliance?"""
54,00:02:57.47,00:02:57.47,What a question.
55,00:03:01.50,00:03:01.50,   You think  I'm going to come out and say
56,00:03:03.37,00:03:03.37,"  ""Oh, yeah, we got four of us voting up against all you guys."
57,00:03:06.30,00:03:06.30,"  We're going to knock you all    down to the end."" Come on."
58,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,It won't be bad if you get in the water.
59,00:03:11.73,00:03:11.73,COLLEEN:   Those people flat out lied
60,00:03:14.13,00:03:14.13, in front of a national   television audience.
61,00:03:16.97,00:03:16.97," I mean,     they want a million bucks"
62,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43, and they're going to get it...
63,00:03:21.20,00:03:21.20,  And I loved Jeff's question
64,00:03:23.17,00:03:23.17,"  ""Is, uh, a deserving person    going to win this money?"""
65,00:03:25.73,00:03:25.73,"  The answer to that question is ""no."""
66,00:03:27.63,00:03:27.63,"How you doing this morning, Kelly?"
67,00:03:29.47,00:03:29.47,   I'm doing.
68,00:03:31.53,00:03:31.53, I didn't really sleep   last night.
69,00:03:33.07,00:03:33.07,No.
70,00:03:33.07,00:03:33.07,No?
71,00:03:34.90,00:03:34.90, KELLY:    This whole alliance thing   is getting too stupid
72,00:03:37.20,00:03:37.20, and too crazy.
73,00:03:38.43,00:03:38.43,"  If we stick with it,"
74,00:03:40.07,00:03:40.07,  it's just like lining lambs    to the slaughter.
75,00:03:42.10,00:03:42.10,"  Who goes next? Who goes...?   like, that's no fun."
76,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,I know.
77,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,"We were targeted already, anyway."
78,00:03:46.63,00:03:46.63,"If we keep annoying them like we are,"
79,00:03:48.47,00:03:48.47,we're going to be gone really soon.
80,00:03:50.63,00:03:50.63," KELLY:  Yeah, I don't like it."
81,00:03:52.13,00:03:52.13, I-I'm not happy playing    the game that way.
82,00:03:53.97,00:03:53.97,"  If I'm going to win,"
83,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,"   if I'm really going to be    the last survivor,"
84,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67," if I'm really going to survive   and really do this,"
85,00:04:00.07,00:04:00.07, then it has to be on my own.
86,00:04:27.27,00:04:27.27, SEAN:   Rich is definitely     in this very good
87,00:04:28.90,00:04:28.90,"strategic position for himself, I think."
88,00:04:31.03,00:04:31.03,"He's worked hard. Well, not that hard."
89,00:04:32.60,00:04:32.60,Just happens to be good at spearfishing.
90,00:04:34.37,00:04:34.37,He doesn't do much else.
91,00:04:36.13,00:04:36.13, He sure don't do a damn thing around here except fish.
92,00:04:39.67,00:04:39.67, SEAN:  But he's a good sport.
93,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20," I mean, we call him all kinds  of names and make fun of him."
94,00:04:43.83,00:04:43.83,I sort of liked him before I knew he was queer.
95,00:04:46.03,00:04:46.03,"Lost a prong to a good, five-foot nurse shark."
96,00:04:48.87,00:04:48.87,"I got to take them by hand from now on, like Tarzan-style--"
97,00:04:52.37,00:04:52.37,wrestle them.
98,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,"   He's in an ideal position,  'cause I think"
99,00:04:56.97,00:04:56.97,   he's the epicenter of the power right now.
100,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,   He's bringing in the fish.
101,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63,"Oh, my God."
102,00:05:03.40,00:05:03.40,  There's got to be 25 pounds   or 20 pounds of fish here.
103,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67,"It's all about the fish, man."
104,00:05:09.00,00:05:09.00,"The fish don't influence me, though."
105,00:05:10.43,00:05:10.43,  No?
106,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,Not in the least.
107,00:05:12.80,00:05:12.80,You can take the heavy-duty equipment and I'll putz.
108,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,Okay.
109,00:05:16.43,00:05:16.43,'Cause I fed you today.
110,00:05:17.83,00:05:17.83,Yeah.
111,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40," SEAN:    I love Rich, I really do."
112,00:05:21.20,00:05:21.20," He's been a great asset   to this camp,"
113,00:05:23.03,00:05:23.03,  but he is a little immature in his motives at times.
114,00:05:25.20,00:05:25.20,"You'll be so damn full of protein after this meal,"
115,00:05:27.23,00:05:27.23,you won't know what to do with yourself.
116,00:05:28.93,00:05:28.93,This is funny.
117,00:05:30.17,00:05:30.17,I am...
118,00:05:31.33,00:05:31.33,This man...
119,00:05:31.33,00:05:31.33,the master.
120,00:05:33.20,00:05:33.20,  He's very protective   about spearing fish
121,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,  and he brings it up     at every island council:
122,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70,"  ""I'm catching fish.    Don't vote me off."""
123,00:05:39.10,00:05:39.10,  It's an insecurity aspect  to him.
124,00:05:40.23,00:05:40.23, The last island Tribal Council
125,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"when I was talking about, um..."
126,00:05:43.90,00:05:43.90,"  ""I'll be staying around here   because I'm providing fish"""
127,00:05:46.23,00:05:46.23,  was an outright blatant lie.
128,00:05:48.03,00:05:48.03,I'm staying around here    'cause I'm bright.
129,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,  It has nothing to do   with catching fish.
130,00:05:51.57,00:05:51.57,That is a lot of fish.
131,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"RICHARD:  Catching fish    makes people happy,"
132,00:05:55.37,00:05:55.37,  but that's not why
133,00:05:56.60,00:05:56.60,they're voting me here.
134,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,   They're not voting me off
135,00:06:00.07,00:06:00.07, because I'm not letting them.
136,00:06:03.73,00:06:03.73,SUSAN: Tell me if I'm doing it...
137,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,like cutting too much meat.
138,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,"RICHARD: No, you're doing pretty well."
139,00:06:09.20,00:06:09.20,Got it.
140,00:06:11.97,00:06:11.97,Now rip it out.
141,00:06:13.30,00:06:13.30,"I'm sorry, I can't..."
142,00:06:16.97,00:06:16.97,You want to do one?
143,00:06:18.07,00:06:18.07,COLLEEN:  Do you see them
144,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97,  bringing these stingrays
145,00:06:22.03,00:06:22.03, and stuff in?
146,00:06:23.30,00:06:23.30," They're, like,  still flapping around"
147,00:06:24.80,00:06:24.80," and they take this dull knife, and chop off their head."
148,00:06:27.20,00:06:27.20,It's disgusting.
149,00:06:30.10,00:06:30.10,   ( loud slapping )
150,00:06:32.33,00:06:32.33,  If I choose
151,00:06:34.23,00:06:34.23,   to watch my dinner  that came from the sea
152,00:06:36.07,00:06:36.07,"  be killed or not be killed,"
153,00:06:37.57,00:06:37.57,  I would rather not    watch it be killed.
154,00:06:42.20,00:06:42.20,"JENNA: Rich, you're the man."
155,00:06:43.63,00:06:43.63,You are the reef master.
156,00:06:54.93,00:06:54.93,"Yeah, there's some water over here."
157,00:06:58.83,00:06:58.83,"JENNA: Oh, I'm so looking forward"
158,00:07:00.47,00:07:00.47,to this now.
159,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,I wouldn't even eat fish sticks.
160,00:07:03.63,00:07:03.63,SUSAN: I'm just hungry.
161,00:07:04.80,00:07:04.80,I could care less about that.
162,00:07:06.47,00:07:06.47,"  When Rich came in   with a fish,"
163,00:07:09.60,00:07:09.60,"  I said to Rudy, ""I should go and stoke that fire up."""
164,00:07:11.77,00:07:11.77,"  And Rudy's, like, ""Oh, no,    no, no, that's good enough."
165,00:07:14.47,00:07:14.47,"  It's hot enough,"""
166,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67,   and it wasn't hot enough.
167,00:07:24.50,00:07:24.50,"RICHARD: Well, I would say it's done, Rudy,"
168,00:07:26.47,00:07:26.47,   and black.
169,00:07:28.27,00:07:28.27,It curls up into little balls.
170,00:07:29.53,00:07:29.53,I know.
171,00:07:30.80,00:07:30.80, SUSAN:    The fish is tough to cook
172,00:07:32.13,00:07:32.13,  because they cooked   a little bit
173,00:07:33.50,00:07:33.50,  and then they cooled off
174,00:07:34.73,00:07:34.73, and they had to start the fire back up
175,00:07:36.53,00:07:36.53,"and cook the fish again,  so Rich is sort of irritated."
176,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,  ( rhythmic tapping )
177,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,RICHARD:  Rudy's clueless
178,00:07:43.47,00:07:43.47,"when it comes to fish, and, um,   you know, really ruined it."
179,00:07:48.07,00:07:48.07,You ready?
180,00:07:49.07,00:07:49.07,Yep.
181,00:07:52.13,00:07:52.13,RICHARD:  Nobody knew what to do   with cooking the fish
182,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,  and so it sits here
183,00:07:56.57,00:07:56.57," and it sits half on the heat,  and it sits over there"
184,00:07:58.50,00:07:58.50,"and it gets turned over halfway and it doesn't,"
185,00:08:00.30,00:08:00.30, and so it's half-cooked  and overcooked and undercooked
186,00:08:02.90,00:08:02.90," and half of the fish,  half of the three rays"
187,00:08:06.40,00:08:06.40, were wasted... and that infuriates me.
188,00:08:11.23,00:08:11.23, It's overdone.
189,00:08:12.23,00:08:12.23, It's charcoal.
190,00:08:13.23,00:08:13.23,Its wings are curled up.
191,00:08:14.97,00:08:14.97,"  It's very, very easy  to put a fire together"
192,00:08:17.77,00:08:17.77,  that's nice and hot.
193,00:08:19.13,00:08:19.13,Just 'cause I see how to do that
194,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,"doesn't mean anybody else should know how, so..."
195,00:08:23.73,00:08:23.73,"  I was sitting there, just  pissed off, really frustrated."
196,00:08:25.93,00:08:25.93,  I don't want anybody around
197,00:08:27.47,00:08:27.47," I don't want anybody near me   when I'm frustrated,"
198,00:08:29.13,00:08:29.13," and people are sitting there, ""What's wrong?"""
199,00:08:30.83,00:08:30.83, and that just makes it worse.
200,00:08:32.03,00:08:32.03,GERVASE: Don't be hard on yourself.
201,00:08:33.67,00:08:33.67,  Huh?
202,00:08:35.03,00:08:35.03,  Just take it easy--  let us be hard on you.
203,00:08:36.57,00:08:36.57," Okay. Go for it, dude."
204,00:08:38.87,00:08:38.87,"GERVASE: Don't you know how a fire works, man?"
205,00:08:40.73,00:08:40.73,"RICHARD: Uh-huh, I do..."
206,00:08:42.30,00:08:42.30,"   and I'm not really patient about teaching anybody,"
207,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,   so I'm just going   to do it myself from now on.
208,00:08:47.13,00:08:47.13,"  I probably won't get fish,  actually, for a  little while now,"
209,00:08:49.13,00:08:49.13,"  anyway, because they need     to appreciate it."
210,00:08:51.37,00:08:51.37,  I'm bringing in too many    right now.
211,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67, I brought in a bunch yesterday     and a bunch today
212,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,and so we need to take a break
213,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,  and let them kind of hunger  for it again.
214,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,"COLLEEN:    So many times Rich opens    his mouth,"
215,00:09:00.53,00:09:00.53," and I just want to be, like,"
216,00:09:01.90,00:09:01.90,"""Oh, be quiet over there  in the corner."
217,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67," ""You're not making any sense,  and you think you're so smart"
218,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,"  ""and you're... just go home,   and go get your liposuction"
219,00:09:09.80,00:09:09.80,"and go catch more fish,    'cause you're bugging me."""
220,00:09:12.37,00:09:12.37,"  You know, he thinks he's so above everybody"
221,00:09:14.80,00:09:14.80,"and is full of baloney, really."
222,00:09:16.90,00:09:16.90,"RICHARD:    Pathetic, burnt, overdone"
223,00:09:18.77,00:09:18.77,wasteful again.
224,00:09:20.97,00:09:20.97,   Amazes me.
225,00:09:42.23,00:09:42.23, KELLY:   The hardest part now is...
226,00:09:44.77,00:09:44.77,   ( sighs )
227,00:09:45.77,00:09:45.77, ...the food.
228,00:09:46.93,00:09:46.93,  We're hungry
229,00:09:48.20,00:09:48.20,and Rich is the only one  that can fish.
230,00:09:53.10,00:09:53.10,   You got to go out   an hour before it gets dark
231,00:09:55.20,00:09:55.20,"   and then, right at    when it was getting dark,"
232,00:09:56.97,00:09:56.97,  we started getting our bites
233,00:09:58.57,00:09:58.57,"  and then, after it got dark,   we didn't get no more bites."
234,00:10:01.30,00:10:01.30,   We've gone fishing in the morning.
235,00:10:02.77,00:10:02.77, We've gone in the afternoon...    at night.
236,00:10:04.43,00:10:04.43,  We're not catching any fish.
237,00:10:05.90,00:10:05.90,SUSAN: I'm getting to the point
238,00:10:07.30,00:10:07.30,if there ain't no crabs out there
239,00:10:08.87,00:10:08.87,"in a day or two, I ain't gonna to do it no more."
240,00:10:12.23,00:10:12.23," It bothers me  that I can't get my own food,"
241,00:10:14.43,00:10:14.43,  that I have to rely on someone else.
242,00:10:16.07,00:10:16.07," Ooh, big fish."
243,00:10:17.23,00:10:17.23,"Oh, wow!"
244,00:10:20.63,00:10:20.63,"We got a fish, you guys, right?"
245,00:10:22.47,00:10:22.47," It's a fish, for sure."
246,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67, Whoo!
247,00:10:25.50,00:10:25.50,  That's so awesome.   Look at that thing.
248,00:10:26.97,00:10:26.97,He's pretty big.
249,00:10:28.03,00:10:28.03, Fish!
250,00:10:29.87,00:10:29.87, Bloop.
251,00:10:31.63,00:10:31.63, SUSAN:    Good proof    that we can get the fish.
252,00:10:33.63,00:10:33.63,"We caught a fish today, finally-- yes!--"
253,00:10:37.10,00:10:37.10, and it feels so good.
254,00:10:38.73,00:10:38.73,  I feel so accomplished now.
255,00:10:43.57,00:10:43.57," JENNA:  I think, uh,   it disappointed Rich"
256,00:10:46.87,00:10:46.87, that us girls   kept these crab traps going
257,00:10:48.70,00:10:48.70,   and that we caught a fish.
258,00:10:49.90,00:10:49.90,That's good.
259,00:10:53.07,00:10:53.07,  He's going to make    a big point
260,00:10:54.90,00:10:54.90," ""Oh, that ain't a lot   to feed you,"""
261,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,but it's a point  that we did catch it.
262,00:10:58.40,00:10:58.40,"  So, I don't give a ( blip ) about how he's going to see it."
263,00:11:01.10,00:11:01.10, We caught it;   I feel accomplished.
264,00:11:02.40,00:11:02.40, We've done it all now.
265,00:11:03.50,00:11:03.50,"We got a fish, man, a edible fish."
266,00:11:05.37,00:11:05.37,I ain't kidding you.
267,00:11:07.03,00:11:07.03,RUDY: Big one?
268,00:11:08.33,00:11:08.33,"SUSAN: Yeah, pretty nice size."
269,00:11:10.60,00:11:10.60,RUDY: Is he kicking?
270,00:11:11.97,00:11:11.97,"Yeah, he's still alive."
271,00:11:13.23,00:11:13.23,"Yeah, he's still alive."
272,00:11:14.40,00:11:14.40,"Yeah, that's a good one."
273,00:11:15.73,00:11:15.73,I know it.
274,00:11:17.37,00:11:17.37,"SUSAN:   But, yeah,    he's going to be..."
275,00:11:19.00,00:11:19.00, I think it might bother him.
276,00:11:20.90,00:11:20.90,"   In a way, I hope it does."
277,00:11:22.70,00:11:22.70,"  I hope it bugs him,   'cause now he can't"
278,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,"  say that no more, you know?"
279,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03,  'Cause us girls     caught this one.
280,00:11:36.13,00:11:36.13,  ( buzzing )
281,00:11:55.00,00:11:55.00,"Oh, wow."
282,00:11:56.77,00:11:56.77,  I love getting mail
283,00:11:57.87,00:11:57.87,  and there was a log hanging
284,00:11:59.13,00:11:59.13,  above our mailbox.
285,00:12:00.83,00:12:00.83,"  It looked an awful lot like     part of the tree,"
286,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,"  but when I took it down,     there was a sign on there"
287,00:12:04.63,00:12:04.63,"   a little a nursery rhyme, it says:"
288,00:12:05.63,00:12:05.63,"""If you can make like a monkey,"
289,00:12:07.43,00:12:07.43,"   ""then you'll be home free,"
290,00:12:08.57,00:12:08.57,"""if you want barbecue for lunch,"
291,00:12:10.20,00:12:10.20," then go climb a tree."""
292,00:12:11.20,00:12:11.20,Somebody's eating a barbecue.
293,00:12:13.13,00:12:13.13,That sounds like fun.
294,00:12:14.47,00:12:14.47,Shish kebob!
295,00:12:16.23,00:12:16.23," SEAN:  I'm sure the game is   anything but simple,"
296,00:12:19.03,00:12:19.03,"  just, like,     just pick a rope and run."
297,00:12:30.20,00:12:30.20,"  Hey, look who it is!"
298,00:12:32.47,00:12:32.47,"Hey, Jeff."
299,00:12:34.27,00:12:34.27," Well, here's the deal."
300,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,"I thought today,    we'd switch it up a little"
301,00:12:37.83,00:12:37.83,"and show you the carrot, the reward, before the challenge"
302,00:12:41.07,00:12:41.07,so you guys know  exactly what it is...
303,00:12:43.03,00:12:43.03,Listen to your stomach.
304,00:12:44.33,00:12:44.33,You're going for.
305,00:12:45.67,00:12:45.67,Are you smelling this?
306,00:12:47.00,00:12:47.00,This is today's reward.
307,00:12:48.50,00:12:48.50,"Oh, man!"
308,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,"JEFF: Some good, old-fashioned, American barbecue."
309,00:12:52.67,00:12:52.67,We got it all.
310,00:12:54.07,00:12:54.07,"All this stuff, here..."
311,00:12:55.30,00:12:55.30,"Look at that, a lot of meat."
312,00:12:56.93,00:12:56.93,Steak and a hot dog.
313,00:12:58.63,00:12:58.63,JEFF: Some kebobs.
314,00:12:59.67,00:12:59.67,We got your buns... your chips.
315,00:13:01.57,00:13:01.57,A little something to remind you of home.
316,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,And since we're talking  about home...
317,00:13:06.73,00:13:06.73,Why not?
318,00:13:09.73,00:13:09.73,Love letters from home.
319,00:13:11.10,00:13:11.10,"  Jenna, yours on top."
320,00:13:12.30,00:13:12.30,"Oh, I got one!"
321,00:13:13.30,00:13:13.30,I'm so excited.
322,00:13:14.77,00:13:14.77,"JEFF: One of you guys gets a great barbecue,"
323,00:13:17.13,00:13:17.13,"you get to read your letter from home,"
324,00:13:18.87,00:13:18.87,and does it get any better than that?
325,00:13:21.23,00:13:21.23,  Sound good?
326,00:13:22.80,00:13:22.80,GERVASE:  I was shaking   when I saw the food.
327,00:13:25.37,00:13:25.37,"I started shaking because I'm, like, ""That's real chicken."""
328,00:13:27.93,00:13:27.93,Now think about that and then think about rice.
329,00:13:30.17,00:13:30.17,"I'm thinking, how am I going"
330,00:13:31.63,00:13:31.63,to get my grubby little hands
331,00:13:33.20,00:13:33.20,on some of them burgers.
332,00:13:34.70,00:13:34.70,  I'm prepared  to eat rice tonight...
333,00:13:36.37,00:13:36.37,  ( chuckles )
334,00:13:37.70,00:13:37.70,   like every night.
335,00:13:38.73,00:13:38.73,I want the letter from home more
336,00:13:40.77,00:13:40.77," because I can go back  and get rice,"
337,00:13:42.80,00:13:42.80,   but I haven't seen or heard anything from my kids.
338,00:13:45.80,00:13:45.80,"   That's it, I'm going big,   going for all of it."
339,00:13:48.33,00:13:48.33,"No offense, Jeff, but if I win,"
340,00:13:50.43,00:13:50.43,"   you're going hungry, bud, 'cause I'm not sharing."
341,00:13:53.40,00:13:53.40,"  Then, let's go do this thing  and come back and eat."
342,00:13:55.80,00:13:55.80," Man, oh, man."
343,00:13:57.00,00:13:57.00,I want this stuff.
344,00:14:01.60,00:14:01.60," JEFF: Here's the deal: basically, it's a ropes course."
345,00:14:04.77,00:14:04.77,   There are 16 legs.
346,00:14:06.20,00:14:06.20, On each one of them is  a medallion with your number.
347,00:14:09.40,00:14:09.40, You guys have all been  pre-assigned a number.
348,00:14:12.07,00:14:12.07," Pretty simple-- you got to get   through all of them,"
349,00:14:14.40,00:14:14.40,grab a medallion from each one.
350,00:14:16.43,00:14:16.43, First person back here on this platform
351,00:14:18.60,00:14:18.60,with all 16 of their medallions
352,00:14:20.53,00:14:20.53,gets the barbecue.
353,00:14:22.50,00:14:22.50,"  If you fall off the course,   you're out."
354,00:14:24.03,00:14:24.03,Sound good?
355,00:14:25.37,00:14:25.37,Everybody get ready.
356,00:14:26.57,00:14:26.57,You got an eye on where you're going?
357,00:14:28.77,00:14:28.77,"Get up here on the ring, Sean... buddy."
358,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,Yeah.
359,00:14:32.07,00:14:32.07,"   Survivors, ready?!"
360,00:14:34.47,00:14:34.47,  Go!
361,00:14:37.20,00:14:37.20,Aah!
362,00:14:38.20,00:14:38.20,( laughing )
363,00:14:39.20,00:14:39.20,"You got time, Rich."
364,00:14:43.10,00:14:43.10,"   Five, five, five."
365,00:14:44.97,00:14:44.97,"JEFF: Good job, Rich."
366,00:14:47.03,00:14:47.03,Your first medallion.
367,00:14:54.90,00:14:54.90,"Keep it up, Colleen."
368,00:14:56.77,00:14:56.77,You're in second place.
369,00:14:58.80,00:14:58.80,"  Okay, so I love being tall."
370,00:15:01.07,00:15:01.07,JEFF: Try to keep mental notes
371,00:15:02.47,00:15:02.47,of where you've been and where you've
372,00:15:04.27,00:15:04.27,still got to go.
373,00:15:06.33,00:15:06.33,"Careful, Jenna."
374,00:15:12.10,00:15:12.10,"Keep it up, Sean."
375,00:15:14.60,00:15:14.60,12 more to go.

377,00:15:26.50,00:15:26.50,"Come on, I got to go under you."
378,00:15:30.40,00:15:30.40,Ready?
379,00:15:30.40,00:15:30.40,Ready?
380,00:15:33.07,00:15:33.07,All right?
381,00:15:34.83,00:15:34.83,  Yep.
382,00:15:36.00,00:15:36.00,"JEFF: Good work together, guys, on the ladder."
383,00:15:42.27,00:15:42.27,"Keep at it, Rudy."
384,00:15:46.80,00:15:46.80,"You're still in the lead, Kelly."
385,00:15:49.83,00:15:49.83,"Oh, no."
386,00:15:58.17,00:15:58.17, Done!
387,00:15:59.87,00:15:59.87,You got to get back here to the platform.
388,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,"Okay, is anybody else finished?"
389,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,"Oh, that's me!"
390,00:16:05.03,00:16:05.03,   Colleen or Kelly--
391,00:16:06.03,00:16:06.03,first one back here wins.
392,00:16:07.77,00:16:07.77,  ( squeals )
393,00:16:10.73,00:16:10.73,Colleen.
394,00:16:12.07,00:16:12.07,Yeah!
395,00:16:13.83,00:16:13.83,JEFF: Nice job.
396,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,   ( all talking excitedly )
397,00:16:18.43,00:16:18.43,That was awesome!
398,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,Yeah!
399,00:16:22.00,00:16:22.00,"Colleen, right here."
400,00:16:23.87,00:16:23.87,"Good job, Colleen."
401,00:16:25.20,00:16:25.20,We've got this great barbecue--
402,00:16:26.53,00:16:26.53,it looked pretty good... a lot of food--
403,00:16:28.30,00:16:28.30,we've got a great letter from home.
404,00:16:30.00,00:16:30.00,How about inviting...
405,00:16:31.13,00:16:31.13,Everybody!
406,00:16:33.40,00:16:33.40,Not quite.
407,00:16:33.40,00:16:33.40, Don't even make  me pick one.
408,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,JEFF: I do want you to pick one person to come with us...
409,00:16:37.87,00:16:37.87,"Do they get the letter, too?"
410,00:16:39.70,00:16:39.70,JEFF: This person will get their letter
411,00:16:41.50,00:16:41.50,and this person
412,00:16:42.63,00:16:42.63,will also get all the food.

415,00:16:45.93,00:16:45.93,Jenna is going to hear from her kids.
416,00:16:47.67,00:16:47.67,Good work.
417,00:16:49.10,00:16:49.10,"That wasn't a tough decision, was it?"
418,00:16:50.77,00:16:50.77,She didn't get a video.
419,00:16:52.87,00:16:52.87,Thank you so much.
420,00:16:54.17,00:16:54.17,JEFF: Very nice gesture.
421,00:16:56.00,00:16:56.00,"So, you guys can, um, sadly head back to camp"
422,00:16:58.67,00:16:58.67,  and we're going to head down   to the beach
423,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50, and have a barbecue.
424,00:17:02.80,00:17:02.80," Enjoy it, guys."
425,00:17:03.80,00:17:03.80,  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
426,00:17:05.47,00:17:05.47, Okay.

428,00:18:04.37,00:18:04.37,Listen to what Sean says today...
429,00:18:05.97,00:18:05.97,What did he say?
430,00:18:07.20,00:18:07.20,"   He goes, ""Well..."""
431,00:18:08.77,00:18:08.77, 'cause they voted four   against Dirk
432,00:18:10.57,00:18:10.57, when he wasn't there.
433,00:18:11.70,00:18:11.70,Then they voted four against Gretchen
434,00:18:13.50,00:18:13.50,"and then it's, like, they voted six"
435,00:18:15.57,00:18:15.57,"   against... but obviously,    four against Greg,"
436,00:18:17.60,00:18:17.60,"and he's, like,  ""If it happens one more time,"

442,00:18:28.40,00:18:28.40," Sean's the swing vote,  you know what I mean?"
443,00:18:31.43,00:18:31.43,"   'Cause you, me and Gervase could definitely"
444,00:18:33.30,00:18:33.30,do something.
445,00:18:34.30,00:18:34.30,They're going to pick people off
446,00:18:36.33,00:18:36.33,   until it gets down to them
447,00:18:38.67,00:18:38.67," and then they're going   to start eating each other,"
448,00:18:40.73,00:18:40.73, you know what I mean?
449,00:18:42.10,00:18:42.10," But I'm saying, like, why are we sitting back"
450,00:18:43.63,00:18:43.63,and watching it happen?
451,00:18:45.13,00:18:45.13,"So, let's do it."
452,00:18:46.40,00:18:46.40,( chuckling )
453,00:18:48.13,00:18:48.13," JEFF:    All right,  here are your letters."
454,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,You read yours first.
455,00:18:53.07,00:18:53.07,"Oh, mine's so thick."
456,00:18:54.30,00:18:54.30,I love it.
457,00:18:55.33,00:18:55.33,Go on and read yours.
458,00:18:57.90,00:18:57.90,"  Oh, my God."
459,00:18:59.10,00:18:59.10," Oh, they're drawings!"

463,00:19:11.17,00:19:11.17,   How cute.
464,00:19:12.30,00:19:12.30,"Yeah, we have them all over the house."
465,00:19:14.53,00:19:14.53,( sniffles )
466,00:19:15.77,00:19:15.77,My car interior windows are decorated
467,00:19:18.13,00:19:18.13, with stickers I can no longer get off.

471,00:20:04.17,00:20:04.17," Happy birthday, Rich."
472,00:20:05.23,00:20:05.23,"RICHARD: Thanks, Suzy Q."
473,00:20:06.63,00:20:06.63, SEAN:  Rich's birthday
474,00:20:08.03,00:20:08.03,"   is today,    and it's his 39th birthday"
475,00:20:10.13,00:20:10.13, and he celebrated immediately
476,00:20:11.93,00:20:11.93, by taking off    all of his clothes
477,00:20:13.90,00:20:13.90, and celebrating  in his birthday suit...
478,00:20:19.47,00:20:19.47,  which you never get used
479,00:20:21.03,00:20:21.03,to seeing Richard naked.
480,00:20:27.60,00:20:27.60,   ( laughs )
481,00:20:28.73,00:20:28.73,RICHARD:  I'm 39 today
482,00:20:30.43,00:20:30.43,  and I had intended
483,00:20:32.03,00:20:32.03, for quite a long time to celebrate my birthday naked.
484,00:20:36.23,00:20:36.23,"   And I'm sure he does love   to be naked,"
485,00:20:37.93,00:20:37.93, and I'm glad for that
486,00:20:39.73,00:20:39.73,"  and I thought I'd be okay    with that,"
487,00:20:42.57,00:20:42.57, but sitting at the fire   this morning
488,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13, and he comes just walking up
489,00:20:45.77,00:20:45.77," and sits, like,    two inches from me"
490,00:20:47.33,00:20:47.33,naked...
491,00:20:49.30,00:20:49.30, I wanted to get away.
492,00:20:51.43,00:20:51.43,"All the nakedness, I'm just..."
493,00:20:51.43,00:20:51.43,( laughing )
494,00:20:53.70,00:20:53.70,I'm just having a problem with this nakedness.
495,00:20:56.03,00:20:56.03,"It felt awkward sitting next to a naked gay man,"
496,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17," and if he had, like, something   to cover the butt crack area"
497,00:21:01.23,00:21:01.23, I'd be cool with that.
498,00:21:02.93,00:21:02.93," RUDY:  When I go home,  my wife asks me about--"
499,00:21:04.73,00:21:04.73,"  ""Well, who was with you?"""

502,00:21:11.47,00:21:11.47,  ( laughing )
503,00:21:13.23,00:21:13.23,COLLEEN:  Rich wanted to be naked     for his birthday.
504,00:21:15.70,00:21:15.70,"Oh, fun."
505,00:21:16.70,00:21:16.70,Show off a little more.
506,00:21:18.10,00:21:18.10,"I mean, he was doing it for shock value."
507,00:21:20.33,00:21:20.33,  It's goofy.
508,00:21:21.33,00:21:21.33,  Who walks around naked 24/7?
509,00:21:23.00,00:21:23.00,I think you were doing it for shock value.
510,00:21:25.07,00:21:25.07,RICHARD: For shock value?
511,00:21:26.30,00:21:26.30,   Is it shock value?
512,00:21:27.63,00:21:27.63,  I don't know   if it's shock value or not.
513,00:21:29.43,00:21:29.43,  Colleen was particularly uncomfortable with my nakedness
514,00:21:32.27,00:21:32.27,"   and when she saw me naked,    she just made a funny face"
515,00:21:34.80,00:21:34.80,and put her hands over her face
516,00:21:36.77,00:21:36.77,   and who knows what that's   intended to signal?
517,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17,"  I said to you, like,   ""Oh, my God, Rich."""
518,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83, But if I lived my life  based on what
519,00:21:44.27,00:21:44.27,"made other people uncomfortable,"
520,00:21:46.53,00:21:46.53,I wouldn't be living my life.

609,00:24:23.37,00:24:23.37,  but about Sean's    alphabetical order.
610,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,It's like my granddaddy   used to say:
611,00:24:27.77,00:24:27.77,"""If you want to be seen,    stand up,"
612,00:24:29.87,00:24:29.87,"   ""If you want to be heard,    speak up,"
613,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,"and if you want   to be appreciated, shut up."""
614,00:24:34.43,00:24:34.43,I'm just going to stay in alphabetical order.
615,00:24:37.00,00:24:37.00,  It's all I can do.
616,00:24:58.00,00:24:58.00,"  We've tested your physical strength,"
617,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57," your swimming ability,  your agility,"
618,00:25:01.23,00:25:01.23,your speed... all that.
619,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,  Today is something   a little different.
620,00:25:04.03,00:25:04.03,"  It's up here, in your head."
621,00:25:05.17,00:25:05.17,This is a game that requires strategy.
622,00:25:06.73,00:25:06.73,"It's a lot like chess, a little bit"
623,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,"   like tic-tac-toe,"
624,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,"   but unlike chess, where you're taking one person,"
625,00:25:11.97,00:25:11.97,you've got seven people to think about.
626,00:25:14.13,00:25:14.13,The way the game works is you'll start on a square
627,00:25:17.17,00:25:17.17,"   and you'll simply, one at a time, on my cue"
628,00:25:19.07,00:25:19.07,"move to another square,"
629,00:25:20.33,00:25:20.33,turning the square over   behind you.
630,00:25:21.87,00:25:21.87,As long as you can keep stepping
631,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73,"to another square, you're still alive,"
632,00:25:25.97,00:25:25.97,but when you run out
633,00:25:27.23,00:25:27.23,"of red squares to step on, you're out."
634,00:25:29.60,00:25:29.60,"So now, if you just flip over these squares here,"
635,00:25:32.93,00:25:32.93,we'll determine the order.
636,00:25:34.43,00:25:34.43,"Oh, yeah, baby."
637,00:25:35.43,00:25:35.43,"Oh, yes."
638,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27," Now, in any particular order,"
639,00:25:39.03,00:25:39.03,  step on one  of the flower squares.
640,00:25:40.73,00:25:40.73,It does not matter.
641,00:25:41.77,00:25:41.77,These are all even when you begin.
642,00:25:45.43,00:25:45.43,"   So, Rich, you're up first."
643,00:25:50.37,00:25:50.37, Perfect. Rudy.
644,00:25:53.73,00:25:53.73,Sean.
645,00:25:57.83,00:25:57.83,"Gervase, to you."
646,00:26:03.50,00:26:03.50,Sue.
647,00:26:07.80,00:26:07.80,Colleen.
648,00:26:11.33,00:26:11.33, Kelly.
649,00:26:15.40,00:26:15.40, Jenna.
650,00:26:27.43,00:26:27.43,Sue.
651,00:26:32.73,00:26:32.73,Colleen.
652,00:26:34.93,00:26:34.93,Colleen.
653,00:26:35.93,00:26:35.93,Yeah... I'm out!
654,00:26:36.93,00:26:36.93,JEFF: Take a step back
655,00:26:38.67,00:26:38.67,and flip that one over.
656,00:26:40.67,00:26:40.67,There you go.
657,00:26:41.87,00:26:41.87,Take a seat on the log.
658,00:26:43.40,00:26:43.40,That full meal has got you...
659,00:26:45.37,00:26:45.37,sated.
660,00:26:47.37,00:26:47.37,  All right... Kelly.
661,00:26:54.00,00:26:54.00,   Jenna-- out on the island   by herself.
662,00:27:01.13,00:27:01.13,Kelly.
663,00:27:02.97,00:27:02.97, SUSAN: Just had to get  in the center.
664,00:27:04.37,00:27:04.37,"Looks like you're out, Kelly."
665,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73,  Just doing my part.
666,00:27:06.73,00:27:06.73,JEFF: Join Colleen over there.
667,00:27:08.30,00:27:08.30,Jenna.
668,00:27:12.20,00:27:12.20,Rich.
669,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,I'm out.
670,00:27:17.23,00:27:17.23,"Sue, you're out."
671,00:27:19.37,00:27:19.37,   All right.
672,00:27:20.90,00:27:20.90, Jenna.
673,00:27:25.07,00:27:25.07,"Sean, you foiled my plan."
674,00:27:27.13,00:27:27.13,"SEAN: Sorry, baby."
675,00:27:28.47,00:27:28.47,"Was that your plan, Sean?"
676,00:27:30.03,00:27:30.03,"No. Well, yeah, once she got behind me, yeah, yeah."
677,00:27:32.97,00:27:32.97,To block her?
678,00:27:34.63,00:27:34.63, Rich.
679,00:27:36.17,00:27:36.17,"You need to worry about yourself, Hatch."
680,00:27:38.30,00:27:38.30,"No, there's nothing I can do."
681,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17," I'm whimpering    into nowhere-land, here..."
682,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,Rudy.
683,00:27:43.57,00:27:43.57,Slowly dying...
684,00:27:44.63,00:27:44.63,the wise old man is looking good.
685,00:27:46.93,00:27:46.93,Sean.
686,00:27:47.93,00:27:47.93,"Oh, no, Sean, no, Sean."
687,00:27:49.63,00:27:49.63,"Don't you know you're dead, Sean?"
688,00:27:51.30,00:27:51.30,You're ruining it.
689,00:27:52.37,00:27:52.37,You got 50 million.
690,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,"She won't last, Sean."
691,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,Rudy will last longer.
692,00:27:57.43,00:27:57.43,He'll have to kill me.
693,00:27:58.77,00:27:58.77,"Otherwise, I could have bebopped around."
694,00:28:00.53,00:28:00.53,Sorry. I'm doing what  I think is right.
695,00:28:02.70,00:28:02.70,"  Oh, Sean..."
696,00:28:02.70,00:28:02.70,JEFF: Gervase.
697,00:28:03.97,00:28:03.97,"Bad move, Sean."
698,00:28:05.37,00:28:05.37,   You could have gotten Rudy  out of there.
699,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,"No, he couldn't have."
700,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,"Yes, he could have."
701,00:28:09.03,00:28:09.03,"All right, Rich."
702,00:28:12.27,00:28:12.27,Rudy.
703,00:28:13.43,00:28:13.43,Rudy has many more options.
704,00:28:15.03,00:28:15.03,Down there.
705,00:28:16.07,00:28:16.07,   He's doing right.
706,00:28:17.10,00:28:17.10,You should've diagonal so...
707,00:28:18.90,00:28:18.90,"Don't listen to her, Rudy."
708,00:28:20.57,00:28:20.57,"She's trying to trick you, Rudy."
709,00:28:22.70,00:28:22.70,Shut up. I am not.
710,00:28:23.73,00:28:23.73,"It's those young girls, Rudy,"
711,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,trying to get in your head.
712,00:28:26.60,00:28:26.60,"Stay strong, Rudy."
713,00:28:31.43,00:28:31.43,JENNA: Is it my turn?
714,00:28:33.77,00:28:33.77,Gervase.
715,00:28:37.60,00:28:37.60,Still alive.
716,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"Jenna, you, unfortunately, are not."
717,00:28:40.83,00:28:40.83,You're out.
718,00:28:42.90,00:28:42.90,I figured you are.
719,00:28:44.67,00:28:44.67,Yoo-haw!
720,00:28:46.37,00:28:46.37,"JEFF: Rich, turn over"
721,00:28:47.70,00:28:47.70,your last tile-- you're done.
722,00:28:49.00,00:28:49.00,Bye!
723,00:28:50.93,00:28:50.93,"Rudy, it's down to you three"
724,00:28:53.30,00:28:53.30,for immunity from tonight's vote.
725,00:28:55.83,00:28:55.83,"Go sidewards! Go left, Rudy, go left!"
726,00:28:57.93,00:28:57.93,GERVASE:   No coaching  from the side.
727,00:28:59.63,00:28:59.63,"  No, no, no.  Directly to your left."
728,00:29:01.07,00:29:01.07,"GERVASE: To the right, Rudy!"
729,00:29:02.20,00:29:02.20,Take... take...
730,00:29:03.43,00:29:03.43,"No, left, Rudy,"
731,00:29:04.60,00:29:04.60,because then you have down here...
732,00:29:06.33,00:29:06.33," Up to the right, Rudy."
733,00:29:07.50,00:29:07.50,   She's trying to trick you.
734,00:29:08.83,00:29:08.83,"No, no, no, no, buddy."
735,00:29:10.07,00:29:10.07,This one.
736,00:29:11.47,00:29:11.47,"Yeah, there you go."
737,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,"Good job, Rudy."
738,00:29:14.93,00:29:14.93,Gervase.
739,00:29:18.50,00:29:18.50,   Ain't gonna work.
740,00:29:20.20,00:29:20.20,"You've won, Rudy, if you take that path."
741,00:29:22.13,00:29:22.13,"SUSAN: If you go at a diagonal across,"
742,00:29:23.93,00:29:23.93,you got more squares than him to land on.
743,00:29:25.67,00:29:25.67,JENNA: You've got more squares left.
744,00:29:27.23,00:29:27.23,There you go!
745,00:29:28.40,00:29:28.40, SUSAN:  There you go.
746,00:29:29.73,00:29:29.73,"Yeah, now you're heading up to the beach."
747,00:29:34.93,00:29:34.93,I think it's a foregone conclusion.
748,00:29:36.30,00:29:36.30,( sighs )
749,00:29:38.60,00:29:38.60,"Flip that over, Gervase."
750,00:29:41.77,00:29:41.77,"JENNA: Good job, Rudy."
751,00:29:42.80,00:29:42.80, SUSAN:  There you go.
752,00:29:43.83,00:29:43.83,"You got it, Rudy."
753,00:29:44.90,00:29:44.90,"Hang tight, buddy."
754,00:29:46.53,00:29:46.53,We're going to be taking that tile from you any minute.
755,00:29:50.20,00:29:50.20,  ( cheering )
756,00:29:52.77,00:29:52.77,"JEFF: Rudy, you win."
757,00:29:54.37,00:29:54.37,Take the honor of flipping the rest
758,00:29:56.80,00:29:56.80, of these over for me.
759,00:30:35.57,00:30:35.57,  ( buzzing )
760,00:30:37.30,00:30:37.30,Tonight's going to be interesting.
761,00:30:38.77,00:30:38.77,"Oh, yeah?"
762,00:30:40.50,00:30:40.50," SUSAN:    Really, when they  first got here,"
763,00:30:41.93,00:30:41.93,they were  really ambitious.
764,00:30:43.13,00:30:43.13,Now you can see their ambition's
765,00:30:44.47,00:30:44.47,"kind of, like, filtering a little bit."
766,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23," If I feel like sitting  in a hammock all day,"
767,00:30:48.13,00:30:48.13,I'm going to sit  in a hammock all day.
768,00:30:49.70,00:30:49.70,I'm not going to stop you.
769,00:30:50.83,00:30:50.83,No.
770,00:30:52.00,00:30:52.00,"COLLEEN:  We had fun, you know?"
771,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,"  We had-- Pagong was a good,    was a good place to live."
772,00:30:58.10,00:30:58.10,  Now we moved    into the new neighborhood
773,00:31:00.67,00:31:00.67,   with the nasty neighbors.
774,00:31:02.47,00:31:02.47,  ( grunting )
775,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,SUSAN: I want to go over
776,00:31:05.53,00:31:05.53,in my house for awhile and bitch.
777,00:31:07.63,00:31:07.63,COLLEEN:  Then we came in here
778,00:31:09.80,00:31:09.80,"like, ""Maybe we can all be friends"""
779,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,"and they came in, like, ""We can smash 'em."""
780,00:31:13.30,00:31:13.30,"Yes, they did."
781,00:31:15.20,00:31:15.20,COLLEEN: The people who came in swinging    were Rich and Sue.
782,00:31:17.77,00:31:17.77,  They knew.
783,00:31:18.77,00:31:18.77, They're smart.
784,00:31:19.77,00:31:19.77,  They're very smart people...
785,00:31:21.77,00:31:21.77, Although Rich is just a numbskull. God!
786,00:31:24.40,00:31:24.40,"RICHARD: All you 16, 15 weirdoes are making me nutty."
787,00:31:27.60,00:31:27.60,  I'm losing my mind.
788,00:31:29.07,00:31:29.07,COLLEEN:  People are wishy-washy.
789,00:31:30.97,00:31:30.97,"   They're conniving   and they're stupid,"
790,00:31:32.93,00:31:32.93,"  and that's what's happening,"
791,00:31:34.70,00:31:34.70,  and it's all out in the open  for everybody to see.
792,00:31:37.73,00:31:37.73, The decision   that I feel I'm left with is
793,00:31:41.73,00:31:41.73," do I interact    with these people, have fun"
794,00:31:44.30,00:31:44.30, and just wait  till my ticket comes up
795,00:31:46.57,00:31:46.57,  or do I try and strategize  and try and make a difference?
796,00:31:50.03,00:31:50.03,It's so sad now.
797,00:31:51.27,00:31:51.27,"You know, we just wait, you know?"
798,00:31:53.73,00:31:53.73,Unless...
799,00:31:54.73,00:31:54.73, we think of something.
800,00:31:56.23,00:31:56.23, ( whistling )
801,00:31:58.87,00:31:58.87,"   Yesterday, at the dinner,"
802,00:32:00.10,00:32:00.10,  we had a whole conversation
803,00:32:01.40,00:32:01.40, about forming a new alliance.
804,00:32:03.00,00:32:03.00,"Yeah, shh..."
805,00:32:04.07,00:32:04.07, We're going to vote the same
806,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,"and we figure that this puts us  in jeopardy for the next one,"
807,00:32:10.03,00:32:10.03,"  but we were    in jeopardy anyway, so..."
808,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,"GERVASE:  Well, we tried     the ""be nice, honor"" way."
809,00:32:14.13,00:32:14.13," It didn't work,    so don't be stupid anymore."
810,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67," It's just, we're smarter now."
811,00:32:18.27,00:32:18.27,"  We saw that  that way didn't work,"
812,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,   so we got to switch gears.
813,00:32:33.33,00:32:33.33,COLLEEN:    What if I
814,00:32:34.53,00:32:34.53,just had this as a skirt?
815,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,"   Oh, that's killer!"
816,00:32:39.43,00:32:39.43,GERVASE: I don't think models even wear
817,00:32:41.87,00:32:41.87,skirts that short.
818,00:32:43.90,00:32:43.90,"JENNA: Go for it, Colleen! Wear it!"
819,00:32:48.87,00:32:48.87,"  Not doing that, Sue?"
820,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67," Jenna and I were just,"
821,00:32:52.80,00:32:52.80," you know, goofing off"
822,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17," and, uh, Kelly decided    to join in."
823,00:32:56.93,00:32:56.93, I feel bad for Kelly    because she wants to play.
824,00:32:59.13,00:32:59.13,"  And Rich is, like,   ""Something's happened to you"
825,00:33:01.43,00:33:01.43,"  ""since these girls came."
826,00:33:02.57,00:33:02.57," I'm really worried about you,"""
827,00:33:04.23,00:33:04.23,kind of putting her in her place
828,00:33:06.17,00:33:06.17,   and makes her feel
829,00:33:07.20,00:33:07.20,  a little self-conscious.
830,00:33:08.77,00:33:08.77, By her being nervous
831,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,"and wishy-washy  about where her loyalties lie,"
832,00:33:13.10,00:33:13.10,   it's really making  Sue and Rich nervous.
833,00:33:15.00,00:33:15.00,You're young.
834,00:33:16.00,00:33:16.00,You hung out with the chicks.
835,00:33:17.23,00:33:17.23,There's more Pagong members than Tagi members
836,00:33:19.13,00:33:19.13,and the Pagong members...
837,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,Pagong members don't like any of us.
838,00:33:21.77,00:33:21.77,They like you a lot better than any of us.
839,00:33:23.63,00:33:23.63,  Kelly's acting a little odd.
840,00:33:26.00,00:33:26.00,"  She's dressing like the other two that are her age,"
841,00:33:29.57,00:33:29.57, and I'm hoping
842,00:33:30.83,00:33:30.83," that Kelly hasn't, uh,  shifted trust"
843,00:33:33.10,00:33:33.10, and-and joined forces   with somebody else.
844,00:33:35.70,00:33:35.70,All them girls are dressed the same today.
845,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00," SEAN:  Yeah, they're dressing  like, uh, superheroes."
846,00:33:40.33,00:33:40.33, RUDY:    Like who?
847,00:33:41.33,00:33:41.33, Superheroes.
848,00:33:44.17,00:33:44.17,They were dancing around here a little while ago.
849,00:33:46.70,00:33:46.70,It looked like the third grade.
850,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,  I thought  about a female alliance
851,00:33:50.47,00:33:50.47,"  and watching them,"
852,00:33:51.93,00:33:51.93,"  the way they walk around,   hand in hand."
853,00:33:54.07,00:33:54.07,"I even thought about lesbianism,   but, uh, maybe not."
854,00:33:57.57,00:33:57.57, I don't know.
855,00:33:58.93,00:33:58.93,"And, uh, it could happen if they had any brains,"
856,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,   but I don't think they got    enough brains to do that.
857,00:34:04.67,00:34:04.67,"  I move objects with my mind,"
858,00:34:06.43,00:34:06.43, but only I can see it.
859,00:34:07.90,00:34:07.90, KELLY:  I probably will have
860,00:34:09.57,00:34:09.57,the swing vote tonight.
861,00:34:11.20,00:34:11.20,"  I'd said before, you know,     alliance or no alliance,"
862,00:34:13.77,00:34:13.77, there's two people that I have    in mind to vote off
863,00:34:16.07,00:34:16.07," and they're two people that,     um, are-are competition,"
864,00:34:18.60,00:34:18.60," but, um, they annoy me"
865,00:34:21.47,00:34:21.47,  and... ( chuckling )
866,00:34:22.80,00:34:22.80, they're kind of sucky  to live with.
867,00:34:32.60,00:34:32.60,"Let's roll, Gervase."
868,00:34:33.87,00:34:33.87,Get out of here.
869,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,COLLEEN:   I really don't know  what's going to happen
870,00:34:44.03,00:34:44.03,  at Tribal Council tonight.
871,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,  I know I'm voting for Rich.
872,00:34:46.97,00:34:46.97,I know Jenna's voting for Rich.
873,00:34:48.97,00:34:48.97, I know Gervase   is voting for Rich.
874,00:34:50.77,00:34:50.77,"GERVASE:  As long as he's catching fish,"
875,00:34:54.00,00:34:54.00,"  people are gonna try   to keep him around,"
876,00:34:55.77,00:34:55.77,"   so I say, get rid of Rich   and we all starve together."
877,00:34:58.20,00:34:58.20," JENNA:    The rest of my alliance,"
878,00:35:00.37,00:35:00.37, if that's what   you want to call it?
879,00:35:02.10,00:35:02.10,"Yeah, we're all voting for Rich."
880,00:35:04.20,00:35:04.20, He's ruthless
881,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80, and the fact that we're voting    him out on his birthday--
882,00:35:09.07,00:35:09.07,  it's not lost on me.
883,00:35:10.53,00:35:10.53,  We're giving him    a birthday present.
884,00:35:12.70,00:35:12.70,"  Okay, let's do this, Brutus!"
885,00:35:14.53,00:35:14.53,Gotta go.
886,00:35:25.27,00:35:25.27, JEFF:   Today's immunity challenge  saw wisdom and strategy
887,00:35:28.67,00:35:28.67,  outplay youth and strength.
888,00:35:30.70,00:35:30.70,  Tonight it's Rudy     who's safe from the vote
889,00:35:32.93,00:35:32.93, as the others  contemplate their fate.
890,00:35:37.47,00:35:37.47,But this is not   the only vote on their mind.
891,00:35:40.20,00:35:40.20,"  Beginning tonight with Greg, all members voted off the island"
892,00:35:44.23,00:35:44.23,  will return  to subsequent Tribal Councils
893,00:35:46.93,00:35:46.93,   as part of a jury.
894,00:35:48.00,00:35:48.00,  They will gather information
895,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83," for a very important decision,"
896,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,"  because, ultimately, these seven will decide"
897,00:35:54.73,00:35:54.73,"who, of the final two survivors,"
898,00:35:57.03,00:35:57.03,   leaves the island  with the million-dollar prize.
899,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,   ( gong clanging )
900,00:36:27.07,00:36:27.07,You're back.
901,00:36:28.30,00:36:28.30,Tribal Council number nine.
902,00:36:30.03,00:36:30.03,27 days you guys have been here.
903,00:36:32.43,00:36:32.43,"At the last Tribal Council, we established"
904,00:36:34.63,00:36:34.63,"our core group of nine,   so from that"
905,00:36:37.87,00:36:37.87,two of you will make it to the final vote.
906,00:36:39.80,00:36:39.80,The other seven
907,00:36:41.07,00:36:41.07,will form a jury that will really decide
908,00:36:43.47,00:36:43.47,that final vote.
909,00:36:44.93,00:36:44.93," Now, in order to make  an informed decision,"
910,00:36:47.53,00:36:47.53,the jury needs information.
911,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,"So, beginning tonight, Greg will be joining us here"
912,00:36:53.10,00:36:53.10,as part of the jury.
913,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,He's merely here
914,00:36:55.70,00:36:55.70,"to observe, gather information"
915,00:36:57.63,00:36:57.63,that he'll base his decision on
916,00:37:00.10,00:37:00.10,"and at each tribal council, when somebody else is voted off,"
917,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70, they will return to join Greg.
918,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33," Happy birthday    to you, Mr. Hatch."
919,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67," Thanks, Jeff."
920,00:37:09.93,00:37:09.93,Something we talked about today.
921,00:37:11.43,00:37:11.43,You were going to spend the day  in your birthday suit.
922,00:37:12.87,00:37:12.87," That was part of your original  idea, anyway."
923,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,  Yep.
924,00:37:15.40,00:37:15.40,A couple of people voiced concern
925,00:37:17.30,00:37:17.30,"that, uh, ""Maybe I don't like this."""
926,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"Well, I just enjoy being nude."
927,00:37:21.10,00:37:21.10,I'm on a deserted island in the middle of the South China Sea.
928,00:37:24.10,00:37:24.10," I thought, what better place?"
929,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67, What better place than  to just hang out nude?
930,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,But it did make a couple of people uncomfortable
931,00:37:30.03,00:37:30.03,"so I thought, ""Why bother?"""
932,00:37:31.87,00:37:31.87, Sean. I got to ask you
933,00:37:33.87,00:37:33.87,about the alphabet thing.
934,00:37:35.67,00:37:35.67, The alphabet.
935,00:37:37.40,00:37:37.40,  Give me the rationale so I'm absolutely clear on it.
936,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,The rationale is many-fold.
937,00:37:41.43,00:37:41.43,"First of all, it gives me an order"
938,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,that I can follow pretty easily--
939,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,that's always nice.
940,00:37:44.73,00:37:44.73,And it is strategic.
941,00:37:45.97,00:37:45.97,"If you look at the order, the actual alphabet,"
942,00:37:47.90,00:37:47.90,"a lot of the Pagong people in the beginning,"
943,00:37:49.20,00:37:49.20,a lot of Tagi people in the end.
944,00:37:50.20,00:37:50.20,This tortures me.
945,00:37:51.27,00:37:51.27,Every three days. I hate it.
946,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17," Jenna, what's    your take on that?"
947,00:37:55.13,00:37:55.13,I'm next.
948,00:37:56.23,00:37:56.23,I'm today.
949,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,That's true.
950,00:37:58.37,00:37:58.37,"Yes. I'm ""J."""
951,00:37:59.67,00:37:59.67,"  That's, that's cool."
952,00:38:01.67,00:38:01.67,She knows she wouldn't take it personally
953,00:38:03.43,00:38:03.43,and I think she's a safe vote tonight.
954,00:38:05.10,00:38:05.10,"If I was... felt she was in jeopardy,"
955,00:38:06.93,00:38:06.93,  I would think twice    at the very least
956,00:38:09.20,00:38:09.20,   of casting a vote.
957,00:38:10.20,00:38:10.20,"Sue, what's your take on that"
958,00:38:11.60,00:38:11.60,as somebody who might come up soon
959,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,in the alphabet and get a vote
960,00:38:14.63,00:38:14.63,against you even if Sean
961,00:38:16.10,00:38:16.10,thinks you're the greatest person here?
962,00:38:18.77,00:38:18.77,"Oh, Sean just...  he's neurotic."
963,00:38:20.90,00:38:20.90,"   He's just, he's an idiot."
964,00:38:22.73,00:38:22.73," SEAN:    Thanks a lot, Sue."
965,00:38:23.77,00:38:23.77,  Thank you very much.
966,00:38:25.07,00:38:25.07,"  It's like, wow, okay,  so I'm next, you know?"
967,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,"That's the way he votes, that's the way he votes."
968,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,  I... I just think he just...
969,00:38:32.13,00:38:32.13,"   I don't know, that  or he doesn't have"
970,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,enough balls to make a decision.
971,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,I don't have a malicious bone in my body
972,00:38:37.43,00:38:37.43,"and I think that casting a vote,"
973,00:38:39.30,00:38:39.30,it makes me feel malicious.
974,00:38:40.90,00:38:40.90,I want to avoid it.
975,00:38:42.00,00:38:42.00,"Yeah, but you came into this knowing..."
976,00:38:43.93,00:38:43.93,knowing you were going to have to do this.
977,00:38:46.03,00:38:46.03,"Me, I've changed my vote"
978,00:38:47.67,00:38:47.67,"   like, three times    within the last two hours."
979,00:38:49.87,00:38:49.87,"And now it's me, right?"
980,00:38:51.57,00:38:51.57,  ( laughing )
981,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,No. No.
982,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43, How important  is Richard right now?
983,00:38:56.97,00:38:56.97, He seems to be the only guy-- at least of who's left--
984,00:38:59.37,00:38:59.37,that's able to catch fish.
985,00:39:01.13,00:39:01.13,No. We did today.
986,00:39:02.40,00:39:02.40,Trapped it.
987,00:39:04.97,00:39:04.97, We nailed a fish today   in the trap.
988,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,We have a bream.
989,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,They got a fish.
990,00:39:08.13,00:39:08.13, SUSAN:   We got a fish today.
991,00:39:09.43,00:39:09.43,A nice-sized fish.
992,00:39:10.70,00:39:10.70,I'm outta here.
993,00:39:11.73,00:39:11.73,We gave it to Richard for his birthday.
994,00:39:13.73,00:39:13.73,"All right, it's time to vote."
995,00:39:15.67,00:39:15.67,Gervase.
996,00:39:30.97,00:39:30.97,   My vote's for Rich
997,00:39:32.27,00:39:32.27,"   because the longer Rich is on this island,"
998,00:39:34.20,00:39:34.20, the bigger of a threat he becomes to me
999,00:39:36.07,00:39:36.07,"  taking that million dollars,"
1000,00:39:37.60,00:39:37.60,"  so I figure if I get rid of him now,"
1001,00:39:39.37,00:39:39.37,"  everybody else will be cake,    so, happy birthday, Rich."
1002,00:39:52.27,00:39:52.27,Eliminating a big mouth.
1003,00:40:06.30,00:40:06.30,"Continuing my alphabetic    strategy,"
1004,00:40:08.07,00:40:08.07,"  Jenna, you know I love you,   no offense to this."
1005,00:40:10.17,00:40:10.17,I hope you don't get voted off.
1006,00:40:11.83,00:40:11.83,I don't think...
1007,00:40:13.40,00:40:13.40, you might have one vote or two   votes or something like that
1008,00:40:16.17,00:40:16.17,"   but nothing major,  I don't think. I hope."
1009,00:40:33.63,00:40:33.63,"  Fish or not, I think   he's getting near the point,"
1010,00:40:36.27,00:40:36.27, he's ready to go home.
1011,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,Even though it is his birthday.
1012,00:40:43.37,00:40:43.37,"JEFF: As always, your identity"
1013,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,"at Tribal Council is noted by your fire, your torch."
1014,00:40:48.10,00:40:48.10,Directly across from you
1015,00:40:49.77,00:40:49.77, are the eight torches
1016,00:40:51.30,00:40:51.30,   of the first eight people    voted off.
1017,00:40:53.20,00:40:53.20," Tonight, another torch will be   added to that group"
1018,00:40:55.77,00:40:55.77, and that person will join Greg  next week as part of our jury.
1019,00:41:00.17,00:41:00.17,I'll go tally the votes.
1020,00:41:09.80,00:41:09.80,"   I just want to remind you that once the votes are tallied,"
1021,00:41:13.00,00:41:13.00, the decision is final.
1022,00:41:14.23,00:41:14.23,The person will be asked
1023,00:41:15.63,00:41:15.63,to leave the Tribal Council area   immediately.
1024,00:41:18.40,00:41:18.40,Now I'll read the votes.
1025,00:42:10.87,00:42:10.87," That's three votes for Jenna,  three votes for Rich."
1026,00:42:19.10,00:42:19.10,The last vote...
1027,00:42:21.60,00:42:21.60," ""J"" for Jenna."
1028,00:42:25.27,00:42:25.27,"Jenna, you need to bring your torch over."
1029,00:42:40.80,00:42:40.80,"Jenna, the tribe has spoken."
1030,00:42:44.50,00:42:44.50,It's time for you to go.
1031,00:42:46.70,00:42:46.70,Thanks.
1032,00:42:47.80,00:42:47.80,Good-bye.
1033,00:43:08.07,00:43:08.07,Jenna is now part of the jury.
1034,00:43:10.93,00:43:10.93,She'll return next week  and join Greg.
1035,00:43:12.40,00:43:12.40,The rest of you
1036,00:43:13.90,00:43:13.90, can head back to camp.
1037,00:43:15.37,00:43:15.37,  Good night.
1038,00:43:41.23,00:43:41.23, Next week on Survivor...
1039,00:43:41.23,00:43:41.23,A cigar!
1040,00:43:44.90,00:43:44.90, Good news for Gervase.
1041,00:43:46.27,00:43:46.27,"  Hey, everybody, it's a boy!"
1042,00:43:49.47,00:43:49.47,"  Having left the alliance,"
1043,00:43:51.17,00:43:51.17,  will Kelly now vote   against them?
1044,00:43:52.60,00:43:52.60,You're seeming more down.
1045,00:43:54.47,00:43:54.47," KELLY:  And if I'm going to do  something conniving and dirty,"
1046,00:43:57.40,00:43:57.40,  let's get Rich off.
1047,00:43:59.17,00:43:59.17,Me and Kelly are taking him down.
1048,00:44:06.00,00:44:06.00,"Well, I had a good time."
1049,00:44:07.13,00:44:07.13,It was a great time on the island.
1050,00:44:08.73,00:44:08.73, I felt like I was  targeted tonight
1051,00:44:10.73,00:44:10.73, because they knew that
1052,00:44:11.97,00:44:11.97," Sean would vote for me  alphabetically,"
1053,00:44:13.83,00:44:13.83, so they knew they'd get  an easy off with me.
1054,00:44:15.97,00:44:15.97, They were more  powerful because  Pagong went into it
1055,00:44:18.43,00:44:18.43," a little naive,  so, that's it."
1056,00:44:20.80,00:44:20.80," I had  a really good time,"
1057,00:44:22.60,00:44:22.60,and no hard feelings and nothing's taken personally.
