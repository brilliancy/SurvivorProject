37,00:01:52.21,00:01:52.21,>> Here you go.>> Tonight at tribal council was
38,00:01:55.29,00:01:55.29,hard.I would have never voted for Ami

40,00:02:03.54,00:02:03.54,key in this game.You can't be playing all the
41,00:02:06.50,00:02:06.50,"sides like that.If she had just stuck with me,"
42,00:02:10.50,00:02:10.50,"she'd still be in this game, andErik would be gone."
43,00:02:14.17,00:02:14.17,>> I don't understand how shedidn't feel part of our group.
44,00:02:18.62,00:02:18.62,>> How the hell am I still heretoday?
45,00:02:24.21,00:02:24.21,I have no idea.I feel like I'm in this house
46,00:02:28.21,00:02:28.21,"that keeps falling down andsomehow I'm, like, making my way"
47,00:02:32.08,00:02:32.08,through it as it's breakingapart.
48,00:02:35.29,00:02:35.29,">> Oh, my god.>> This was the first time the"
49,00:02:38.17,00:02:38.17,favorites have kept a fan andvoted out one of their own.
50,00:02:41.12,00:02:41.12,It feels insane.>> This tribal council tonight
51,00:02:50.21,00:02:50.21,set a definite precedent on fansversus favorites in this game.
52,00:02:53.42,00:02:53.42,It's kind of like all bets areoff.
53,00:02:56.00,00:02:56.00,It's kind of every man forthemselves at this point.

59,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,"Jason, because we're both kindof on the outs with our tribe."
60,00:04:27.17,00:04:27.17,"We both also love this game, andI think we both annoy people."
61,00:04:30.08,00:04:30.08,I'm not going to lie.I think that that kind of unites
62,00:04:32.42,00:04:32.42,"us, too.>> Oh, my god."
63,00:04:48.08,00:04:48.08,Jason told me that he had thehidden immunity idol.
64,00:04:52.04,00:04:52.04,"I mean, oh, my god.It's just crazy."
65,00:04:55.46,00:04:55.46,That puts you in a really goodposition.
66,00:04:57.88,00:04:57.88,Jason having the hidden immunityidol means that it's a good
67,00:05:01.33,00:05:01.33,"alliance for me to have, andhopefully we can take it to the"

72,00:05:32.58,00:05:32.58,immediately.You will receive instructions
73,00:05:36.12,00:05:36.12,"when you get there."">> Oh, my god."
74,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,>> We're leaving our beach?>> We're leaving.
75,00:05:43.12,00:05:43.12,">> We're merging.>> Yeah, I think we're merging."
76,00:05:45.54,00:05:45.54,">> ""Immediately"" means rightnow."
77,00:05:47.79,00:05:47.79,">> Oh, all right, all right.>> A merge would be highly"
78,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,beneficial for me because Iwould think I would have more of
79,00:05:55.50,00:05:55.50,"a shot at this game, becausethere's more players now on the"
80,00:05:57.96,00:05:57.96,"board to choose from as opposedto Malakal, which is now four,"
81,00:06:03.12,00:06:03.12,and those odds aren't very goodto survive.
82,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,And if you want to bringsomebody in or if I want to
83,00:06:14.12,00:06:14.12,"bring somebody in, I'll tell youand Amanda before anything goes."
84,00:06:15.92,00:06:15.92,>> Cool.>> I owe it to you guys 100%.

86,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,the whole time.>> That's fine.
87,00:06:23.33,00:06:23.33,One thing that did come out oflast night is rather than being
88,00:06:26.79,00:06:26.79,"in opposition to Ozzy, one ofthe most powerful players in the"
89,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,"game, I'm now allied with him insome kind of, like, zookeeper"

91,00:06:37.42,00:06:37.42,"he's the zookeeper now, becauseI owe him my life now."
92,00:06:40.83,00:06:40.83,It makes total sense.Just play it straight up with
93,00:06:45.29,00:06:45.29,"somebody that you know.>> Yeah, exactly."
94,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,">> ""Airai, make your way to thelocation designated on the map"

102,00:07:44.08,00:07:44.08,"Natalie, and Amanda.So I feel like I have the"
103,00:07:47.92,00:07:47.92,"numbers on my side no matterwhat, but I'm going to have a"

109,00:08:08.25,00:08:08.25,"and, you know, that's the game.But I think right now we're"
110,00:08:11.46,00:08:11.46,certainly banking on the factthat it's not really fans and
111,00:08:13.79,00:08:13.79,favorites anymore.( cheers )

115,00:09:02.79,00:09:02.79,could possibly imagine.I was really expecting to see

117,00:09:08.92,00:09:08.92,probably my closest ally andclosest friend in this game.

119,00:09:15.25,00:09:15.25,she's not here.>> Let's eat!

138,00:10:18.12,00:10:18.12,throws it on his plate and juststarts chowing down on this bat.
139,00:10:21.29,00:10:21.29,I guess it's a Micronesianthing.
140,00:10:23.29,00:10:23.29,"I don't know.>> Oh, James, it's, like wet."
141,00:10:25.88,00:10:25.88,"You have, like, wet bat in yourhand right now."

144,00:10:37.17,00:10:37.17,"It was like a juicy rabbit.So, I mean, I'm going to"
145,00:10:39.08,00:10:39.08,probably eat another one.>> I was thinking of a tribe

156,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,"Hell, no, I didn't look upMicronesian."
157,00:11:08.08,00:11:08.08,I just wanted to name the tribesomething funny.

162,00:11:19.67,00:11:19.67,"and then, you know, then we'reback to the game?"
163,00:11:22.58,00:11:22.58,"But take time, just, ""Boom."">> Talk, get to know each other."
164,00:11:25.42,00:11:25.42,">> I would like that.>> When you merge two tribes,"
165,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,"all of a sudden, it becomes amuch more interpersonal game."
166,00:11:32.62,00:11:32.62,"Your alliances become veryfuzzy, because at this point"
167,00:11:36.08,00:11:36.08,it's ten individual people thatyou now have to survive another

178,00:12:22.38,00:12:22.38,And I felt like it was verygenuine from both sides.
179,00:12:24.46,00:12:24.46,">> I think that you really dodeserve to be here, and I would"
180,00:12:27.00,00:12:27.00,rather have you here thansomebody else.

189,00:13:13.96,00:13:13.96,Heaven.>> Wow.
190,00:13:17.21,00:13:17.21,>> Look how scenic this is.I feel like I'm in the land of
191,00:13:19.92,00:13:19.92,"milk and honey over here,because they have this huge open"
192,00:13:23.62,00:13:23.62,"space where they have their dayshelter, and they have a huge"
193,00:13:26.33,00:13:26.33,"cave where, like, people canhang out if it rains."
194,00:13:29.46,00:13:29.46,It's ridiculous how nice it ishere.
195,00:13:31.92,00:13:31.92,>> A little siesta in the shade.>> It's going to be a little
196,00:13:48.75,00:13:48.75,hard getting used to seeingthese new folks just grabbing
197,00:13:51.04,00:13:51.04,stuff and picking.It's like people coming into
198,00:13:53.25,00:13:53.25,your house and picking up theremote and turning the channel.
199,00:13:56.08,00:13:56.08,"I mean, granted, we're all onehappy team now, so we'll all"
200,00:14:01.08,00:14:01.08,just have to get along.>> Cool.
201,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,">> You guys got a spear, too?>> Yeah, we've got two."
202,00:14:08.54,00:14:08.54,>> Nice.>> Yeah.
203,00:14:10.33,00:14:10.33,">> Flippers?>> Actually, I've been waiting"
204,00:14:12.12,00:14:12.12,"all game for you to teach me.>> Flippers, too?"
205,00:14:14.88,00:14:14.88,">> No, but, I mean, I'm a gooddiver."
206,00:14:17.21,00:14:17.21,">> Jason is a big fan of mine,but he probably believes that he"
207,00:14:19.75,00:14:19.75,"can do it all better, and heprobably wants to prove himself"
208,00:14:23.08,00:14:23.08,to me or to the world.And he's going to prove himself
209,00:14:26.88,00:14:26.88,"or he's not.But going to Exile, I found out"
210,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,someone has taken my plantedidol.
211,00:14:34.17,00:14:34.17,"Most likely, it's Jason.To me, I think he's the only one"
212,00:14:38.17,00:14:38.17,who would have had theopportunity to look who hasn't
213,00:14:43.58,00:14:43.58,been voted out.So I think that Jason walking
214,00:14:46.00,00:14:46.00,around with my fake hiddenimmunity idol is a beautiful
215,00:14:48.08,00:14:48.08,thing.I think it's poetry in the
216,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,making.>> I brought the hidden immunity
217,00:15:01.88,00:15:01.88,idol with me from Airai.So right now I'm kind of just
218,00:15:06.54,00:15:06.54,"walking around, scoping outareas where I think, you know, I"
219,00:15:09.21,00:15:09.21,might hide it.The sooner I can get it out of
220,00:15:11.17,00:15:11.17,"my bag, the more comfortableI'll feel."
221,00:15:14.88,00:15:14.88,"Hopefully, you know, nobody willdiscover it here."
222,00:15:18.17,00:15:18.17,"I'm just going to try to tuck itup in this rock here real nice,"
223,00:15:20.96,00:15:20.96,"so that, you know, nobody'swalking by... so that when"
224,00:15:26.17,00:15:26.17,"somebody is walk by, they won'tsee it."
225,00:15:31.75,00:15:31.75,"So I'm going to... you know,hopefully I won't forget this"
226,00:15:34.25,00:15:34.25,spot either.>> What happened?
227,00:15:42.75,00:15:42.75,>> With Ami?>> Yeah.
228,00:15:44.71,00:15:44.71,">> Did you ask Amanda or anyone?>> Yeah, she said Ami was trying"
229,00:15:47.46,00:15:47.46,to vote Ozzy out.>> Yep.
230,00:15:58.33,00:15:58.33,">> Well, you know, regardless ofwhat happened with her, that you"
231,00:16:00.62,00:16:00.62,"guys have my loyalty 100%.You know that, right?"
232,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,">> Yeah.>> I mean, I guess she just"
233,00:16:15.33,00:16:15.33,"thought, you know, she couldsave herself."
234,00:16:26.88,00:16:26.88,>> The old Malakal?>> Yeah.
235,00:16:29.54,00:16:29.54,>> I don't know.>> I mean I don't know.
236,00:16:41.71,00:16:41.71,">> I know, but things havechanged, and it's, like, a whole"
237,00:16:43.58,00:16:43.58,"different game, you know?>> Now that the two tribes have"
238,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,"merged, it's an individual game.Ami's gone and I feel"
239,00:16:50.29,00:16:50.29,"outnumbered, and I feel on theouts."
240,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,"I don't feel like I have anyreal close allies, except for"
241,00:16:55.67,00:16:55.67,"Jason.I mean, if I at least got in"
242,00:16:58.08,00:16:58.08,"with the favorites, then itwould be, ""Okay, I can get my"
243,00:17:00.67,00:17:00.67,"way to the final six and thenwork from there."""
244,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,"But if I'm not even in withthem, I could be next to go."
245,00:17:07.38,00:17:07.38,"I mean, this is just... this isa disaster."
246,00:17:10.46,00:17:10.46,">> I don't know what's going onyet, honestly."
247,00:17:14.25,00:17:14.25,I'm not going to lie to you.>> Okay.
248,00:17:16.29,00:17:16.29,"I appreciate that.>> With the merge, it's not fans"
249,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,"versus favorites anymore, Idon't think."
250,00:17:21.42,00:17:21.42,>> I hope you'll keep me in theloop.
251,00:17:23.25,00:17:23.25,">> Yeah.>> Of course, Eliza is always"
252,00:17:25.08,00:17:25.08,trying to scramble somethingtogether because she's always on
253,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,the outside.And I think it's hilarious that
254,00:17:29.38,00:17:29.38,"she's still trying to come up tome and tell me that she's loyal,"
255,00:17:33.04,00:17:33.04,"and 100% true to the end.Like, how can anyone be so"
256,00:17:36.12,00:17:36.12,ridiculous?I have missed you so much.
257,00:17:43.75,00:17:43.75,">> Oh, my god.>> You don't know how long I've"
258,00:17:45.54,00:17:45.54,"been dying to just have thisconversation with you, because"
259,00:17:47.33,00:17:47.33,"I'm like, ""I just want her toknow everything that's going"
260,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,"on."">> Eliza's staring at us."
261,00:17:52.96,00:17:52.96,She's always staring at us.She's over there staring at us.
262,00:17:55.96,00:17:55.96,I can't have her here anymore.>> I'm so sick of her.
263,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,>> She's going next.She has to.
264,00:18:11.92,00:18:11.92,">> And they're like... they'relike, ""Yeah, but, honestly..."
265,00:18:18.04,00:18:18.04,"""Well, me andAmanda are really tight, and"
266,00:18:20.21,00:18:20.21,"it's pretty much unbreakable.""And they understand."
267,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,I've put us in an alliancewithout you being there.
268,00:18:30.75,00:18:30.75,"But at least the game'srevolving around us, which is"
269,00:18:34.21,00:18:34.21,good.But we're in such a mess because
270,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,these people are voting in theend for who gets the million.
271,00:18:43.75,00:18:43.75,>> I know.>> And if we ( bleep ) them
272,00:18:46.96,00:18:46.96,"over...>> Well, it's inevitable now."
273,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,"Parvati pretty much screwed meover, because I don't want to be"
274,00:18:52.08,00:18:52.08,in an alliance with Natalie andAlexis.
275,00:18:54.29,00:18:54.29,I don't want to go up againstAlexis at the end.
276,00:18:56.92,00:18:56.92,"She's a motivational speaker,for crying out loud."
277,00:18:59.67,00:18:59.67,"Well, well, well.>> Yeah, so here's our pickle,"
278,00:19:04.00,00:19:04.00,and we're in it.Now I might as well go make an
279,00:19:06.83,00:19:06.83,"alliance with Erik, Jason, andEliza right now, a triple"
280,00:19:08.54,00:19:08.54,pickle.>> Might as well.
281,00:19:10.71,00:19:10.71,">> I mean, I giggled about it toher, but it's not funny."
282,00:19:12.88,00:19:12.88,>> Everybody's on the same pageabout Eliza.
283,00:19:18.00,00:19:18.00,">> I'm livid, and it leaves mewith a lot of questions about"
284,00:19:19.88,00:19:19.88,Parvati.>> Tree mail.
285,00:19:34.79,00:19:34.79,">> Tree mail.>> ""If you feel you're in over"

288,00:19:44.25,00:19:44.25,"you're safe is to be the lastone to bail out."""
289,00:19:47.83,00:19:47.83,>> Oh!>> Endurance.
290,00:19:50.33,00:19:50.33,>> It's bailing water orsomething.
291,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,>> Maybe it's as the tide comesin.
292,00:19:55.54,00:19:55.54,>> Yeah.>> You start to drown?
293,00:19:57.12,00:19:57.12,>> Yeah.>> I'd say that Eliza and myself
294,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,are definitely still on theoutskirts of any kind of
295,00:20:03.42,00:20:03.42,"alliances in the new Dabu tribe,but the hidden immunity idol is"
296,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,definitely my biggest bargainingchip.
297,00:20:12.33,00:20:12.33,"If I can win the individualimmunity challenge, it will, you"
298,00:20:15.71,00:20:15.71,"know, allow me to give away thehidden immunity idol."
299,00:20:19.67,00:20:19.67,"Because if I have the immunitynecklace, the votes are going to"
300,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,be cast toward someone else likeEliza.
301,00:20:32.21,00:20:32.21,>> ...I'd give it to you.So think about that.
302,00:20:35.54,00:20:35.54,">> Okay, I'll think about it.Jason pulls me aside and it's"
303,00:20:38.04,00:20:38.04,"like, ""Oh, by the way, if I canwin the individual immunity"
304,00:20:40.75,00:20:40.75,"challenge, the hidden immunityidol, I'll give it to you."""
305,00:20:43.46,00:20:43.46,Who would have guessed?I made an alliance with the
306,00:20:46.46,00:20:46.46,right person who was sent toExile one too many times.
307,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,So I'm in good spirits today.Then whoever Jason and I vote
308,00:20:52.96,00:20:52.96,"for, even if everyone else votesfor me, will go home."
309,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys!Alexis, you came up with a new"

311,00:21:26.58,00:21:26.58,"It is Micronesian for good.And it was Erik's suggestion,"
312,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,and it was awesome.It fit perfectly.
313,00:21:31.88,00:21:31.88,">> JEFF: All right, you guysready to get it your first"

316,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,Tribal immunity is no more.This is now what you covet--
317,00:21:47.54,00:21:47.54,individual immunity.This now becomes the single most
318,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"important thing in this game.Have this around your neck, you"
319,00:21:54.08,00:21:54.08,"are safe in this game.Without it, you are most"
320,00:21:56.58,00:21:56.58,definitely vulnerable.Today's challenge is going to
321,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,test your ability to remain calmwhen everything else in your
322,00:22:04.75,00:22:04.75,body urges you to do otherwise.You're each going to take a spot
323,00:22:08.21,00:22:08.21,in the water underneath a gratedsteel barrier.
324,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,"As the tide rises, the waterwill rise."
325,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,"As the water rises, yourbreathing space will decrease"
326,00:22:18.58,00:22:18.58,until you have nowhere left tobreathe.
327,00:22:21.88,00:22:21.88,Your head must stay completelyunder the grate at all times.
328,00:22:25.33,00:22:25.33,The person who stays in thischallenge the longest wins
329,00:22:29.29,00:22:29.29,"immunity, is guaranteed a one innine shot at a million bucks."
330,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,I'll give you a minute tostrategize.
331,00:22:37.17,00:22:37.17,"We'll get started.>> JEFF: All right, here we go."

341,00:23:47.50,00:23:47.50,You can't hear anymore.It's going to mean trouble for
342,00:23:51.71,00:23:51.71,people who panic.Amanda is the first out.
343,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,Head popped up behind the grate.You can take a spot on the

345,00:24:10.17,00:24:10.17,You just weren't payingattention?

351,00:24:42.54,00:24:42.54,to bail and get out of this.Just mind over matter.
352,00:24:47.08,00:24:47.08,"Remind yourself, you can alwaystake one last deep breath."
353,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,Parvati has had enough.She opts out.

375,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,"Ozzy.>> Come out, Oz."
376,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50,">> JEFF: Ozzy really struggling,but he is back up."
377,00:27:45.54,00:27:45.54,Ozzy comes up.It's over.
378,00:27:47.92,00:27:47.92,Jason wins first individualimmunity!
379,00:27:58.62,00:27:58.62,">> Awww!>> JEFF: Jason, congrats."
380,00:28:02.21,00:28:02.21,Come on over.Nice work.
381,00:28:10.58,00:28:10.58,Individual immunity.Safe at tribal council tonight.
382,00:28:13.83,00:28:13.83,"For the other nine of you, notthe case."
383,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,Somebody going home.You have the afternoon to figure
384,00:28:18.33,00:28:18.33,out who it's going to be.See you at tribal.
385,00:28:43.21,00:28:43.21,">> Thank you.>> I know, awesome, good job."
386,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,>> Quite exciting getting tobeat Ozzy.
387,00:28:49.21,00:28:49.21,"My, quote, like, favorite playerin the game, you know, watching"
388,00:28:52.12,00:28:52.12,"him dominate in so manychallenges, and then..."
389,00:28:54.50,00:28:54.50,>> Beating him.>> Yep.
390,00:28:56.54,00:28:56.54,">> Knowing if you weren't there,he would have won that one."
391,00:28:58.42,00:28:58.42,>> Yep.Today's immunity challenge I was
392,00:29:01.12,00:29:01.12,"able to win.In fact, I think I actually"
393,00:29:03.29,00:29:03.29,dominated the whole challenge.When I came up and saw the look
394,00:29:06.67,00:29:06.67,"of failure on Ozzy's face, itwas pretty delightful."
395,00:29:10.67,00:29:10.67,So being able to dominate Ozzyand then hopefully being able to
396,00:29:15.12,00:29:15.12,send him home later tonight willbe one of the highlights of the
397,00:29:18.08,00:29:18.08,game for me.>> Are you kidding?
398,00:29:26.00,00:29:26.00,">> No.Just... I'm always, like... feel"
399,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,like I'm always out of the loop.>> You're definitely in the
400,00:29:33.12,00:29:33.12,loop.>> Eliza has been my biggest
401,00:29:40.38,00:29:40.38,"rival, I think, since thebeginning of this game."
402,00:29:42.62,00:29:42.62,She's been running around tryingto get me voted out personally
403,00:29:45.33,00:29:45.33,"since day one.I mean, everyone on this tribe"
404,00:29:49.54,00:29:49.54,"is voting for her tonight, asfar as I know."
405,00:29:53.21,00:29:53.21,"I wouldn't have trusted her, butif she would have tried to work"
406,00:29:56.38,00:29:56.38,"with me on the other side, itwould have been easier."
407,00:30:00.38,00:30:00.38,"But she was trying to get me outthe whole time, and then she"
408,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,comes up to me and tries to beloyal.
409,00:30:05.42,00:30:05.42,"I'm like, ""Too little, too late,lady."""
410,00:30:13.79,00:30:13.79,>> Jason.I'm pretty sure they're voting
411,00:30:16.21,00:30:16.21,"for me, so...>> I've got you covered."
412,00:30:19.04,00:30:19.04,Don't worry.>> So we're voting Ozzy?
413,00:30:21.33,00:30:21.33,>> Yes.>> You hid it?
414,00:30:28.12,00:30:28.12,>> Yeah.>> Are you going to get it?
415,00:30:29.62,00:30:29.62,>> Yeah!>> Okay.
416,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,">> Don't worry, baby.>> Okay."
417,00:30:33.21,00:30:33.21,I'm trusting you.>> I'll go get it right now.
418,00:30:36.08,00:30:36.08,>> Okay.My god.
419,00:30:38.75,00:30:38.75,It will literally be the biggestblindside in history.
420,00:30:40.96,00:30:40.96,>> I can't wait to send Ozzy'scocky ass home tonight.
421,00:30:45.54,00:30:45.54,"He's going to be like ""What?"">> This might make me more hated"
422,00:30:49.96,00:30:49.96,"than Fairplay.Oh, my god!"
423,00:30:52.67,00:30:52.67,I'm so glad you won today.>> I could have been down there
424,00:30:55.58,00:30:55.58,another ten minutes.>> What's Ozzy and Alexis
425,00:31:09.17,00:31:09.17,talking about?>> I don't know.
426,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,">> All of a sudden this setcomes in and, boom, just hammers"
427,00:31:13.46,00:31:13.46,me and brings me back on theinside.
428,00:31:16.25,00:31:16.25,">> Alexis is dangerous-- very,very, very, very dangerous."
429,00:31:19.67,00:31:19.67,>> Mm-hmm.>> And she needs to go.
430,00:31:21.54,00:31:21.54,>> I'm cool with that.I mean...
431,00:31:23.33,00:31:23.33,>> First.She needs to go now.
432,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,I don't think I know Ozzy aswell as I think I know him.
433,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,">> I keep trying to tell you,missy, he's playing."
434,00:31:29.67,00:31:29.67,">> Well, I'm playing, too.>> I know."
435,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,Amanda seems to believe that weshould probably get rid of
436,00:31:36.96,00:31:36.96,"Alexis, and I think a small bitof jealousy is coming into play"
437,00:31:42.54,00:31:42.54,because of the relationship thatOzzy has with Alexis.
438,00:31:46.83,00:31:46.83,Will he vote her?>> Yeah.
439,00:31:49.83,00:31:49.83,"I don't... I think so.>> But as long as it's not me,"
440,00:31:52.71,00:31:52.71,then I'll vote Alexis.>> It's in my bag.
441,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,>> This is so stupid.This is just a napkin.
442,00:32:33.42,00:32:33.42,"Oh, my god.This isn't it."
443,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,"Jason, come here.What are you doing?"
444,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,What are you trying to pull?I'm going home anyhow.
445,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,It's not the idol.>> It is the idol.
446,00:32:58.25,00:32:58.25,">> It's not the idol.>> Yes, it is."
447,00:33:00.38,00:33:00.38,>> Ozzy must have put it inthere.
448,00:33:02.12,00:33:02.12,He must have the real thing.That's not the idol.
449,00:33:03.79,00:33:03.79,>> What is it?>> It's a ( no audio ) stick.
450,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,>> I know.It has a face on it.
451,00:33:07.58,00:33:07.58,Don't worry.>> Ozzy put it in there and made
452,00:33:09.29,00:33:09.29,"a face on it.>> No, he didn't."
453,00:33:11.04,00:33:11.04,>> It's not the idol.>> Why do you say that?
454,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,>> Because that can't be theidol.
455,00:33:14.50,00:33:14.50,>> Why not?>> Because it's just a stick.
456,00:33:16.29,00:33:16.29,>> I know.Do you think so?
457,00:33:18.08,00:33:18.08,>> I think that that's not theidol.
458,00:33:20.08,00:33:20.08,">> Then that's a bummer.>> Yeah, of course."
459,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,">> JEFF: Alexis, one of thethings that happens when you"
460,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,"merge is it's the first timeeverybody's together, all at"
461,00:33:56.58,00:33:56.58,once.Gives you the opportunity to
462,00:33:59.08,00:33:59.08,start assessing skills.How much time have you spent
463,00:34:02.04,00:34:02.04,"looking at people that are nownew to you thinking, ""This is"
464,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"how they're playing""?>> I think there are three main"
465,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,points that define strength inthis game.
466,00:34:11.54,00:34:11.54,"You know, are they a strongersocial player?"
467,00:34:13.42,00:34:13.42,Are they a stronger physicalplayer?
468,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,Are they a stronger mentalplayer?
469,00:34:17.04,00:34:17.04,So I think the merge is thefirst opportunity where you
470,00:34:19.12,00:34:19.12,really get to see your entirecompetition versus the
471,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,competition within your owntribe.
472,00:34:23.29,00:34:23.29,">> JEFF: Cirie, Alexis brings upthree different types of skills."
473,00:34:26.46,00:34:26.46,What skills do you see thatAlexis has?
474,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,">> So far, I'd say Alexis hasall three."
475,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,"Socially around camp, physicallyduring the challenges, and she's"
476,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,"mentally strong.So I think she's, like, a triple"
477,00:34:40.96,00:34:40.96,threat.Sorry.
478,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,">> JEFF: Alexis, is that alittle worrisome to be outed as"
479,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,a triple threat?>> I don't think at this point
480,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,"in the game.I mean, there's ten people left"
481,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,"out of 20, so I think there areseveral people here left who"
482,00:34:55.46,00:34:55.46,maintain a triple threat.I don't think you make it this
483,00:34:58.96,00:34:58.96,"far if you're not mentally,physically, socially"
484,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,competitive.>> JEFF: You talk about your
485,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,skill list.Tell me about Eliza's skills.
486,00:35:06.75,00:35:06.75,>> I think that Eliza played anincredible physical and mental
487,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,game.I don't think she played as well
488,00:35:13.04,00:35:13.04,"a social game.>> JEFF: You say ""Played."""
489,00:35:15.71,00:35:15.71,">> Pardon me?>> You said it in past tense, as"
490,00:35:20.46,00:35:20.46,"if I've already been voted out.>> Okay, I'm sorry."
491,00:35:23.62,00:35:23.62,">> It's okay.>> JEFF: Eliza, do you agree"
492,00:35:25.71,00:35:25.71,with that?Are you strong and weak as she
493,00:35:27.96,00:35:27.96,says?>> Alexis' assessment was
494,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,probably right on.I think that my social game
495,00:35:33.75,00:35:33.75,potentially has been lacking.But I think that a lot of people
496,00:35:37.96,00:35:37.96,"here are playing a very short-sighted game, and not really"
497,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,looking down the line.So they're overestimating their
498,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,"own social game, I think.>> JEFF: So, Ozzy, there's two"
499,00:35:48.92,00:35:48.92,sides of this social skill.There's the side that's
500,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,threatening because the personis very good socially.
501,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,The other side is the person isso bad socially that maybe you
502,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,"keep them around.>> Yeah, you take someone who"
503,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,"nobody likes to the end, and youwin."
504,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,>> That's the way towin Survivor.
505,00:36:05.17,00:36:05.17,There's no book to winSurvivor.
506,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,That's the schedule.Get the one that everybody hates
507,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,"and keep them along, yeah.>> JEFF: Eliza, you can't miss"
508,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,your eyes when they roll.Do you think you're liked?
509,00:36:15.46,00:36:15.46,">> No, not really.>> She's liked."
510,00:36:17.62,00:36:17.62,">> No, I'm not really liked.>> Well, Eliza, you've been"
511,00:36:20.04,00:36:20.04,running around back and forthtrying to vote me out since day
512,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,"one, then coming back to meyesterday telling me you're"
513,00:36:25.38,00:36:25.38,"going to be 100% loyal to me,that we need to stay true to the"
514,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,old Malakal tribe and favoritesto the end.
515,00:36:31.08,00:36:31.08,Are you kidding me?People are going to believe you?
516,00:36:33.75,00:36:33.75,>> That's not true.Everyone is saying we would
517,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,"stick together, we would sticktogether."
518,00:36:37.88,00:36:37.88,>> But what were you trying todo to me the first day?
519,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,What were you trying to do tome?
520,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,>> I was not trying to doanything to you.
521,00:36:43.25,00:36:43.25,">> I just can't sit here and bequiet anymore, because it's..."
522,00:36:45.25,00:36:45.25,"it's just too much for me.>> JEFF: Eliza, welcome to"
523,00:36:50.04,00:36:50.04,tribal council.No free rides.
524,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,">> I mean, I definitely gotmyself into this mess."
525,00:36:55.88,00:36:55.88,But everyone is here to win amillion dollars.
526,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,"I mean, you know, people havecome awfully close and lost"
527,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,because they went up against thebest.
528,00:37:04.79,00:37:04.79,"You know, so it's, like, are youreally going to make the same"
529,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,"mistake again?I mean, bring people people"
530,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"don't like to the finals withyou, and have a shot, plain and"
531,00:37:12.54,00:37:12.54,"simple.>> JEFF: All right, it is time"
532,00:37:16.33,00:37:16.33,"to get to the vote.Jason, you have the individual"
533,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,immunity necklace.If at any time you want to

535,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"tribal council, you can do that.>> You know, I feel like I have"
536,00:37:28.42,00:37:28.42,no alliances at the new Dabutribe.
537,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,I don't think anyone had aconversation with me the entire
538,00:37:33.29,00:37:33.29,afternoon.>> JEFF: So Jason is clearly not
539,00:37:36.12,00:37:36.12,going to give up the necklace.You cannot vote for Jason.
540,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,Everybody else is fair game.It is time to vote.
541,00:37:41.54,00:37:41.54,"Amanda, you're up.>> I hope something miraculous"

544,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,Hope you learn from yourmistakes the second time around.
545,00:38:29.67,00:38:29.67,>> Tonight my vote is for Ozzy.Hopefully what I gave Eliza is
546,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,the real hidden immunity idol.I can't wait to see the look on
547,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,your face if it is you.>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
548,00:38:52.62,00:38:52.62,votes.If anybody has the hidden
549,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,"immunity idol and you want toplay it, now would be the time"
550,00:39:05.79,00:39:05.79,to do so.The rules of Survivor state that
551,00:39:33.58,00:39:33.58,"if a hidden immunity idol isplayed, then any votes cast"
552,00:39:37.88,00:39:37.88,"against that person do notcount, and the person with the"
553,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,next highest number of voteswould be voted out.
554,00:39:48.08,00:39:48.08,This is not a hidden immunityidol.
555,00:39:51.00,00:39:51.00,>> That means Ozzy has it.Jason found it on Exile.
556,00:39:54.08,00:39:54.08,"Ozzy has the real one.>> Sorry, I couldn't tell you"
557,00:39:56.83,00:39:56.83,"guys, but...>> But it was worth a shot."
