1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF: Previously on Survivor:
2,00:00:03.12,00:00:03.12,"On day one, James and Parvati and Amanda and Ozzy joined"
3,00:00:07.04,00:00:07.04,together to form a powerful alliance.
4,00:00:10.08,00:00:10.08,"And later, Ozzy found the hidden immunity idol..."
5,00:00:14.08,00:00:14.08,"...and replaced it with a fake one as a decoy, which was"
6,00:00:17.88,00:00:17.88,discovered by Jason. >> I guess this is the hidden
7,00:00:22.38,00:00:22.38,immunity idol. >> JEFF: Having the idol put
8,00:00:25.21,00:00:25.21,Ozzy and his alliance in control of the game.
9,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17,>> It's in our little four clique.
10,00:00:29.25,00:00:29.25,And I think it's supposed to be in our little four clique.
11,00:00:31.21,00:00:31.21,>> JEFF: But their control was short-lived.
12,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,"Drop your buffs, we are switching tribes."
13,00:00:35.21,00:00:35.21,A tribe switch blurred the line between fans and favorites.
14,00:00:38.88,00:00:38.88,"At the new Airai, Parvati formed a side alliance with Natalie and"
15,00:00:42.33,00:00:42.33,Alexis. >> I hope Amanda will be down
16,00:00:45.00,00:00:45.00,for that when I get back with her.
17,00:00:46.79,00:00:46.79,">> JEFF: At Malakal, Ami told the fans that she would join"
18,00:00:49.12,00:00:49.12,with them in voting out Ozzy. >> I'm giving all my trust to
19,00:00:52.67,00:00:52.67,you right now. >> Okay.
20,00:00:54.54,00:00:54.54,">> Take care of me. Take care of me, okay, you guys?"
21,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,"Please, because I'm really sticking my neck out there, you"
22,00:00:58.42,00:00:58.42,guys. >> JEFF: But Erik ratted her
23,00:01:00.25,00:01:00.25,out. >> Did Ami try and get me out?
24,00:01:01.83,00:01:01.83,>> Yes. >> Okay.
25,00:01:04.38,00:01:04.38,">> JEFF: At tribal council, Ami desperately tried to defend"
26,00:01:08.17,00:01:08.17,herself. >> I want to be here.
27,00:01:10.71,00:01:10.71,"I swear, I'll give you everything I have."
28,00:01:12.83,00:01:12.83,">> JEFF: In the end, the favorites didn't believe her,"
29,00:01:15.12,00:01:15.12,and Ami was voted out. Eighth person voted out of
30,00:01:18.25,00:01:18.25,"Survivor: Fans Versus Favorites, Ami."
31,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,And for the first time a fan stayed while a favorite went
32,00:01:23.83,00:01:23.83,"home. >> Good luck, you guys."
33,00:01:26.17,00:01:26.17,>> JEFF: Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
34,00:01:39.12,00:01:39.12,">> Fire, come on. You're killing me."
35,00:01:41.50,00:01:41.50,"Oh, god. >> I felt bad."
36,00:01:46.67,00:01:46.67,"It was just, like, I couldn't believe what she was saying."
37,00:01:49.29,00:01:49.29,">> The thing was, she dug her own grave."
38,00:01:52.21,00:01:52.21,>> Here you go. >> Tonight at tribal council was
39,00:01:55.29,00:01:55.29,hard. I would have never voted for Ami
40,00:01:58.00,00:01:58.00,"ever if she had just been honest with me, and that's... that's a"
41,00:02:03.54,00:02:03.54,key in this game. You can't be playing all the
42,00:02:06.50,00:02:06.50,"sides like that. If she had just stuck with me,"
43,00:02:10.50,00:02:10.50,"she'd still be in this game, and Erik would be gone."
44,00:02:14.17,00:02:14.17,>> I don't understand how she didn't feel part of our group.
45,00:02:18.62,00:02:18.62,>> How the hell am I still here today?
46,00:02:24.21,00:02:24.21,I have no idea. I feel like I'm in this house
47,00:02:28.21,00:02:28.21,"that keeps falling down and somehow I'm, like, making my way"
48,00:02:32.08,00:02:32.08,through it as it's breaking apart.
49,00:02:35.29,00:02:35.29,">> Oh, my god. >> This was the first time the"
50,00:02:38.17,00:02:38.17,favorites have kept a fan and voted out one of their own.
51,00:02:41.12,00:02:41.12,It feels insane. >> This tribal council tonight
52,00:02:50.21,00:02:50.21,set a definite precedent on fans versus favorites in this game.
53,00:02:53.42,00:02:53.42,It's kind of like all bets are off.
54,00:02:56.00,00:02:56.00,It's kind of every man for themselves at this point.

57,00:04:13.46,00:04:13.46,">> You know that we've severely pissed off half, at least half,"
58,00:04:16.29,00:04:16.29,"the jury. I mean, really pissed them off."
59,00:04:19.12,00:04:19.12,"Strangely enough, I think my closest ally at this point is"
60,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,"Jason, because we're both kind of on the outs with our tribe."
61,00:04:27.17,00:04:27.17,"We both also love this game, and I think we both annoy people."
62,00:04:30.08,00:04:30.08,I'm not going to lie. I think that that kind of unites
63,00:04:32.42,00:04:32.42,"us, too. >> Oh, my god."
64,00:04:48.08,00:04:48.08,Jason told me that he had the hidden immunity idol.
65,00:04:52.04,00:04:52.04,"I mean, oh, my god. It's just crazy."
66,00:04:55.46,00:04:55.46,That puts you in a really good position.
67,00:04:57.88,00:04:57.88,Jason having the hidden immunity idol means that it's a good
68,00:05:01.33,00:05:01.33,"alliance for me to have, and hopefully we can take it to the"
69,00:05:04.04,00:05:04.04,end. >> And there is tree mail.
70,00:05:20.25,00:05:20.25,"""Malakal, check all of your personal and tribal possessions"
71,00:05:26.54,00:05:26.54,"that you may need to survive for the duration of this game, and"
72,00:05:29.58,00:05:29.58,make your way to the location designated on the map
73,00:05:32.58,00:05:32.58,immediately. You will receive instructions
74,00:05:36.12,00:05:36.12,"when you get there."" >> Oh, my god."
75,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,>> We're leaving our beach? >> We're leaving.
76,00:05:43.12,00:05:43.12,">> We're merging. >> Yeah, I think we're merging."
77,00:05:45.54,00:05:45.54,">> ""Immediately"" means right now."
78,00:05:47.79,00:05:47.79,">> Oh, all right, all right. >> A merge would be highly"
79,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,beneficial for me because I would think I would have more of
80,00:05:55.50,00:05:55.50,"a shot at this game, because there's more players now on the"
81,00:05:57.96,00:05:57.96,"board to choose from as opposed to Malakal, which is now four,"
82,00:06:03.12,00:06:03.12,and those odds aren't very good to survive.
83,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,And if you want to bring somebody in or if I want to
84,00:06:14.12,00:06:14.12,"bring somebody in, I'll tell you and Amanda before anything goes."
85,00:06:15.92,00:06:15.92,>> Cool. >> I owe it to you guys 100%.
86,00:06:18.08,00:06:18.08,">> Cool, thank you. And I'll be straight up with you"
87,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,the whole time. >> That's fine.
88,00:06:23.33,00:06:23.33,One thing that did come out of last night is rather than being
89,00:06:26.79,00:06:26.79,"in opposition to Ozzy, one of the most powerful players in the"
90,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,"game, I'm now allied with him in some kind of, like, zookeeper"
91,00:06:35.08,00:06:35.08,"bond. Like, I'm more the monkey and"
92,00:06:37.42,00:06:37.42,"he's the zookeeper now, because I owe him my life now."
93,00:06:40.83,00:06:40.83,It makes total sense. Just play it straight up with
94,00:06:45.29,00:06:45.29,"somebody that you know. >> Yeah, exactly."
95,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,">> ""Airai, make your way to the location designated on the map"
96,00:06:53.79,00:06:53.79,"immediately."" ( cheers )"
97,00:06:57.58,00:06:57.58,>> Get the heck off this island. And I would not ( no audio ) you
98,00:07:22.25,00:07:22.25,all over. And if we can rely on the four
99,00:07:25.04,00:07:25.04,"of us, that would be rad. >> Oh my god, I am in such a hot"
100,00:07:30.12,00:07:30.12,pickle right now. I have made an alliance with my
101,00:07:33.38,00:07:33.38,"original tribe of Ozzy, James, Cirie, and Amanda."
102,00:07:39.12,00:07:39.12,"And the second alliance that I got myself into is me, Alexis,"
103,00:07:44.08,00:07:44.08,"Natalie, and Amanda. So I feel like I have the"
104,00:07:47.92,00:07:47.92,"numbers on my side no matter what, but I'm going to have a"
105,00:07:50.79,00:07:50.79,"decision to make, you know, down the road."
106,00:07:53.62,00:07:53.62,">> Off to the races, my ladies, off to the races."
107,00:07:57.08,00:07:57.08,">> Oh, yippee! The game has really begun, I"
108,00:07:59.92,00:07:59.92,feel like. If Parvati feels more of an
109,00:08:03.17,00:08:03.17,"alliance to her original group, then Natalie and I will be out,"
110,00:08:08.25,00:08:08.25,"and, you know, that's the game. But I think right now we're"
111,00:08:11.46,00:08:11.46,certainly banking on the fact that it's not really fans and
112,00:08:13.79,00:08:13.79,favorites anymore. ( cheers )
113,00:08:39.58,00:08:39.58,">> Oh, my god! ( cheers )"
114,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,>> Glad to see you. >> Your hair is so fresh.
115,00:08:53.88,00:08:53.88,">> Hey, baby. >> This is the worst merge I"
116,00:09:02.79,00:09:02.79,could possibly imagine. I was really expecting to see
117,00:09:05.83,00:09:05.83,"that Erik was voted out, and instead it was Ami, who was"
118,00:09:08.92,00:09:08.92,probably my closest ally and closest friend in this game.
119,00:09:11.38,00:09:11.38,"And so I feel really alone right now, and I'm heartbroken that"
120,00:09:15.25,00:09:15.25,she's not here. >> Let's eat!
121,00:09:17.92,00:09:17.92,>> Let's eat! >> But I'm trying to stay
122,00:09:21.00,00:09:21.00,positive and act like I'm having fun and try and fit in with the
123,00:09:24.75,00:09:24.75,"group. >> ""Tribes, today is cause for"
124,00:09:28.12,00:09:28.12,celebration. You are merged.
125,00:09:30.54,00:09:30.54,"You will spend the night here to eat, drink, and embrace your new"
126,00:09:33.75,00:09:33.75,"tribe."" ( cheers )"
127,00:09:36.54,00:09:36.54,"""You must decide on a new tribe name, paint your new tribe flag,"
128,00:09:38.79,00:09:38.79,and decide on which of your former tribe beaches you wish to
129,00:09:41.25,00:09:41.25,"live."" >> We're all merged, and we have"
130,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,"to decide what camp to go to. No question, Malakal, all the"
131,00:09:51.25,00:09:51.25,way. We have everything you need.
132,00:09:55.08,00:09:55.08,I'm kind of mad we had to take everything down and we're just
133,00:09:57.42,00:09:57.42,"going back, but, I mean, I'm so glad we're going back."
134,00:10:02.04,00:10:02.04,>> They're bats? >> Yeah.
135,00:10:04.42,00:10:04.42,>> What? >> Bats.
136,00:10:06.83,00:10:06.83,>> I didn't know what was going on.
137,00:10:10.21,00:10:10.21,There was a bowl of bat in the middle of our table.
138,00:10:13.54,00:10:13.54,"And James, of course, James, reaches in and grabs a bat and"
139,00:10:18.12,00:10:18.12,throws it on his plate and just starts chowing down on this bat.
140,00:10:21.29,00:10:21.29,I guess it's a Micronesian thing.
141,00:10:23.29,00:10:23.29,"I don't know. >> Oh, James, it's, like wet."
142,00:10:25.88,00:10:25.88,"You have, like, wet bat in your hand right now."
143,00:10:31.25,00:10:31.25,">> I mean, how often do you get a chance to eat a bat?"
144,00:10:34.67,00:10:34.67,"It's one of the things you have to try, and it was good."
145,00:10:37.17,00:10:37.17,"It was like a juicy rabbit. So, I mean, I'm going to"
146,00:10:39.08,00:10:39.08,probably eat another one. >> I was thinking of a tribe
147,00:10:42.42,00:10:42.42,"name. Like, the name for good here is"
148,00:10:45.08,00:10:45.08,Dabu. So we can do Dabu.
149,00:10:47.25,00:10:47.25,>> Dabu. I like Dabu.
150,00:10:49.12,00:10:49.12,>> Okay. >> Cheers!
151,00:10:51.58,00:10:51.58,>> Our new tribe. >> Good times.
152,00:10:53.25,00:10:53.25,With Gabu? Or Dabu?
153,00:10:56.50,00:10:56.50,>> An experience that we're never going to forget.
154,00:10:58.21,00:10:58.21,">> I told everybody Dabu means good in Micronesian, but really"
155,00:11:01.25,00:11:01.25,"I pretty much just made it up. I love that everyone thinks,"
156,00:11:03.79,00:11:03.79,"like, ""Oh, Erik looked up Micronesian."""
157,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,"Hell, no, I didn't look up Micronesian."
158,00:11:08.08,00:11:08.08,I just wanted to name the tribe something funny.
159,00:11:10.04,00:11:10.04,"For all I care it could have been ""Momo,"" or, like,"
160,00:11:12.25,00:11:12.25,"""Fosshizzle,"" or something. I don't know."
161,00:11:14.92,00:11:14.92,"I like Dabu. >> I like Dabu, too."
162,00:11:17.12,00:11:17.12,">> Does everyone want to agree that, like, let's enjoy this,"
163,00:11:19.67,00:11:19.67,"and then, you know, then we're back to the game?"
164,00:11:22.58,00:11:22.58,"But take time, just, ""Boom."" >> Talk, get to know each other."
165,00:11:25.42,00:11:25.42,">> I would like that. >> When you merge two tribes,"
166,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,"all of a sudden, it becomes a much more interpersonal game."
167,00:11:32.62,00:11:32.62,"Your alliances become very fuzzy, because at this point"
168,00:11:36.08,00:11:36.08,it's ten individual people that you now have to survive another
169,00:11:38.88,00:11:38.88,"17 days with, and it kind of becomes more who do you get"
170,00:11:41.58,00:11:41.58,along with. >> I flipped out.
171,00:11:54.88,00:11:54.88,"I was like, ""Oh, my god."" I was so happy."
172,00:12:00.33,00:12:00.33,>> It was basically my doing. I'm ready to go beyond fans
173,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,versus favorites. >> Yeah.
174,00:12:05.96,00:12:05.96,>> I'm ready to look past that whole thing and really
175,00:12:09.42,00:12:09.42,"understand that... that, yeah. I mean, I like you a lot."
176,00:12:15.04,00:12:15.04,">> You know, I had a great time with Ozzy out on Exile, and I am"
177,00:12:17.46,00:12:17.46,"a fan, you know. So I was just kind of excited to"
178,00:12:20.46,00:12:20.46,come out here and get to know him.
179,00:12:22.38,00:12:22.38,And I felt like it was very genuine from both sides.
180,00:12:24.46,00:12:24.46,">> I think that you really do deserve to be here, and I would"
181,00:12:27.00,00:12:27.00,rather have you here than somebody else.
182,00:12:35.96,00:12:35.96,">> Yeah, right. >> I know Alexis likes Ozzy, but"
183,00:12:39.29,00:12:39.29,"me and Ozzy have been doing this together for 22 days now, and"
184,00:12:43.08,00:12:43.08,"she just comes in and makes herself all comfortable, and,"
185,00:12:46.04,00:12:46.04,"yeah, it bothers me a little bit."
186,00:12:48.75,00:12:48.75,I want her gone. >> Wow!
187,00:13:03.21,00:13:03.21,>> What are you up to? >> Whatever.
188,00:13:08.25,00:13:08.25,>> Good to be back. >> Good to be here.
189,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50,">> Oh, my god. The Malakal beach."
190,00:13:13.96,00:13:13.96,Heaven. >> Wow.
191,00:13:17.21,00:13:17.21,>> Look how scenic this is. I feel like I'm in the land of
192,00:13:19.92,00:13:19.92,"milk and honey over here, because they have this huge open"
193,00:13:23.62,00:13:23.62,"space where they have their day shelter, and they have a huge"
194,00:13:26.33,00:13:26.33,"cave where, like, people can hang out if it rains."
195,00:13:29.46,00:13:29.46,It's ridiculous how nice it is here.
196,00:13:31.92,00:13:31.92,>> A little siesta in the shade. >> It's going to be a little
197,00:13:48.75,00:13:48.75,hard getting used to seeing these new folks just grabbing
198,00:13:51.04,00:13:51.04,stuff and picking. It's like people coming into
199,00:13:53.25,00:13:53.25,your house and picking up the remote and turning the channel.
200,00:13:56.08,00:13:56.08,"I mean, granted, we're all one happy team now, so we'll all"
201,00:14:01.08,00:14:01.08,just have to get along. >> Cool.
202,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,">> You guys got a spear, too? >> Yeah, we've got two."
203,00:14:08.54,00:14:08.54,>> Nice. >> Yeah.
204,00:14:10.33,00:14:10.33,">> Flippers? >> Actually, I've been waiting"
205,00:14:12.12,00:14:12.12,"all game for you to teach me. >> Flippers, too?"
206,00:14:14.88,00:14:14.88,">> No, but, I mean, I'm a good diver."
207,00:14:17.21,00:14:17.21,">> Jason is a big fan of mine, but he probably believes that he"
208,00:14:19.75,00:14:19.75,"can do it all better, and he probably wants to prove himself"
209,00:14:23.08,00:14:23.08,to me or to the world. And he's going to prove himself
210,00:14:26.88,00:14:26.88,"or he's not. But going to Exile, I found out"
211,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,someone has taken my planted idol.
212,00:14:34.17,00:14:34.17,"Most likely, it's Jason. To me, I think he's the only one"
213,00:14:38.17,00:14:38.17,who would have had the opportunity to look who hasn't
214,00:14:43.58,00:14:43.58,been voted out. So I think that Jason walking
215,00:14:46.00,00:14:46.00,around with my fake hidden immunity idol is a beautiful
216,00:14:48.08,00:14:48.08,thing. I think it's poetry in the
217,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,making. >> I brought the hidden immunity
218,00:15:01.88,00:15:01.88,idol with me from Airai. So right now I'm kind of just
219,00:15:06.54,00:15:06.54,"walking around, scoping out areas where I think, you know, I"
220,00:15:09.21,00:15:09.21,might hide it. The sooner I can get it out of
221,00:15:11.17,00:15:11.17,"my bag, the more comfortable I'll feel."
222,00:15:14.88,00:15:14.88,"Hopefully, you know, nobody will discover it here."
223,00:15:18.17,00:15:18.17,"I'm just going to try to tuck it up in this rock here real nice,"
224,00:15:20.96,00:15:20.96,"so that, you know, nobody's walking by... so that when"
225,00:15:26.17,00:15:26.17,"somebody is walk by, they won't see it."
226,00:15:31.75,00:15:31.75,"So I'm going to... you know, hopefully I won't forget this"
227,00:15:34.25,00:15:34.25,spot either. >> What happened?
228,00:15:42.75,00:15:42.75,>> With Ami? >> Yeah.
229,00:15:44.71,00:15:44.71,">> Did you ask Amanda or anyone? >> Yeah, she said Ami was trying"
230,00:15:47.46,00:15:47.46,to vote Ozzy out. >> Yep.
231,00:15:58.33,00:15:58.33,">> Well, you know, regardless of what happened with her, that you"
232,00:16:00.62,00:16:00.62,"guys have my loyalty 100%. You know that, right?"
233,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,">> Yeah. >> I mean, I guess she just"
234,00:16:15.33,00:16:15.33,"thought, you know, she could save herself."
235,00:16:26.88,00:16:26.88,>> The old Malakal? >> Yeah.
236,00:16:29.54,00:16:29.54,>> I don't know. >> I mean I don't know.
237,00:16:41.71,00:16:41.71,">> I know, but things have changed, and it's, like, a whole"
238,00:16:43.58,00:16:43.58,"different game, you know? >> Now that the two tribes have"
239,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,"merged, it's an individual game. Ami's gone and I feel"
240,00:16:50.29,00:16:50.29,"outnumbered, and I feel on the outs."
241,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,"I don't feel like I have any real close allies, except for"
242,00:16:55.67,00:16:55.67,"Jason. I mean, if I at least got in"
243,00:16:58.08,00:16:58.08,"with the favorites, then it would be, ""Okay, I can get my"
244,00:17:00.67,00:17:00.67,"way to the final six and then work from there."""
245,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,"But if I'm not even in with them, I could be next to go."
246,00:17:07.38,00:17:07.38,"I mean, this is just... this is a disaster."
247,00:17:10.46,00:17:10.46,">> I don't know what's going on yet, honestly."
248,00:17:14.25,00:17:14.25,I'm not going to lie to you. >> Okay.
249,00:17:16.29,00:17:16.29,"I appreciate that. >> With the merge, it's not fans"
250,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,"versus favorites anymore, I don't think."
251,00:17:21.42,00:17:21.42,>> I hope you'll keep me in the loop.
252,00:17:23.25,00:17:23.25,">> Yeah. >> Of course, Eliza is always"
253,00:17:25.08,00:17:25.08,trying to scramble something together because she's always on
254,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,the outside. And I think it's hilarious that
255,00:17:29.38,00:17:29.38,"she's still trying to come up to me and tell me that she's loyal,"
256,00:17:33.04,00:17:33.04,"and 100% true to the end. Like, how can anyone be so"
257,00:17:36.12,00:17:36.12,ridiculous? I have missed you so much.
258,00:17:43.75,00:17:43.75,">> Oh, my god. >> You don't know how long I've"
259,00:17:45.54,00:17:45.54,"been dying to just have this conversation with you, because"
260,00:17:47.33,00:17:47.33,"I'm like, ""I just want her to know everything that's going"
261,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,"on."" >> Eliza's staring at us."
262,00:17:52.96,00:17:52.96,She's always staring at us. She's over there staring at us.
263,00:17:55.96,00:17:55.96,I can't have her here anymore. >> I'm so sick of her.
264,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,>> She's going next. She has to.
265,00:18:11.92,00:18:11.92,">> And they're like... they're like, ""Yeah, but, honestly..."
266,00:18:18.04,00:18:18.04,"""Well, me and Amanda are really tight, and"
267,00:18:20.21,00:18:20.21,"it's pretty much unbreakable."" And they understand."
268,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,I've put us in an alliance without you being there.
269,00:18:30.75,00:18:30.75,"But at least the game's revolving around us, which is"
270,00:18:34.21,00:18:34.21,good. But we're in such a mess because
271,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,these people are voting in the end for who gets the million.
272,00:18:43.75,00:18:43.75,>> I know. >> And if we ( bleep ) them
273,00:18:46.96,00:18:46.96,"over... >> Well, it's inevitable now."
274,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,"Parvati pretty much screwed me over, because I don't want to be"
275,00:18:52.08,00:18:52.08,in an alliance with Natalie and Alexis.
276,00:18:54.29,00:18:54.29,I don't want to go up against Alexis at the end.
277,00:18:56.92,00:18:56.92,"She's a motivational speaker, for crying out loud."
278,00:18:59.67,00:18:59.67,"Well, well, well. >> Yeah, so here's our pickle,"
279,00:19:04.00,00:19:04.00,and we're in it. Now I might as well go make an
280,00:19:06.83,00:19:06.83,"alliance with Erik, Jason, and Eliza right now, a triple"
281,00:19:08.54,00:19:08.54,pickle. >> Might as well.
282,00:19:10.71,00:19:10.71,">> I mean, I giggled about it to her, but it's not funny."
283,00:19:12.88,00:19:12.88,>> Everybody's on the same page about Eliza.
284,00:19:18.00,00:19:18.00,">> I'm livid, and it leaves me with a lot of questions about"
285,00:19:19.88,00:19:19.88,Parvati. >> Tree mail.
286,00:19:34.79,00:19:34.79,">> Tree mail. >> ""If you feel you're in over"
287,00:19:38.29,00:19:38.29,your head... >> ...and you're worried about
288,00:19:41.71,00:19:41.71,being voted out... >> ...the only way to guarantee
289,00:19:44.25,00:19:44.25,"you're safe is to be the last one to bail out."""
290,00:19:47.83,00:19:47.83,>> Oh! >> Endurance.
291,00:19:50.33,00:19:50.33,>> It's bailing water or something.
292,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,>> Maybe it's as the tide comes in.
293,00:19:55.54,00:19:55.54,>> Yeah. >> You start to drown?
294,00:19:57.12,00:19:57.12,>> Yeah. >> I'd say that Eliza and myself
295,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,are definitely still on the outskirts of any kind of
296,00:20:03.42,00:20:03.42,"alliances in the new Dabu tribe, but the hidden immunity idol is"
297,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,definitely my biggest bargaining chip.
298,00:20:12.33,00:20:12.33,"If I can win the individual immunity challenge, it will, you"
299,00:20:15.71,00:20:15.71,"know, allow me to give away the hidden immunity idol."
300,00:20:19.67,00:20:19.67,"Because if I have the immunity necklace, the votes are going to"
301,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,be cast toward someone else like Eliza.
302,00:20:32.21,00:20:32.21,>> ...I'd give it to you. So think about that.
303,00:20:35.54,00:20:35.54,">> Okay, I'll think about it. Jason pulls me aside and it's"
304,00:20:38.04,00:20:38.04,"like, ""Oh, by the way, if I can win the individual immunity"
305,00:20:40.75,00:20:40.75,"challenge, the hidden immunity idol, I'll give it to you."""
306,00:20:43.46,00:20:43.46,Who would have guessed? I made an alliance with the
307,00:20:46.46,00:20:46.46,right person who was sent to Exile one too many times.
308,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,So I'm in good spirits today. Then whoever Jason and I vote
309,00:20:52.96,00:20:52.96,"for, even if everyone else votes for me, will go home."
310,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys! Alexis, you came up with a new"
311,00:21:24.58,00:21:24.58,"tribe name? >> Yeah, Dabu is our name."
312,00:21:26.58,00:21:26.58,"It is Micronesian for good. And it was Erik's suggestion,"
313,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,and it was awesome. It fit perfectly.
314,00:21:31.88,00:21:31.88,">> JEFF: All right, you guys ready to get it your first"
315,00:21:34.38,00:21:34.38,individual immunity challenge? >> Yeah.
316,00:21:36.96,00:21:36.96,>> JEFF: First things first. Who's got the idol?
317,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,Tribal immunity is no more. This is now what you covet--
318,00:21:47.54,00:21:47.54,individual immunity. This now becomes the single most
319,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"important thing in this game. Have this around your neck, you"
320,00:21:54.08,00:21:54.08,"are safe in this game. Without it, you are most"
321,00:21:56.58,00:21:56.58,definitely vulnerable. Today's challenge is going to
322,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,test your ability to remain calm when everything else in your
323,00:22:04.75,00:22:04.75,body urges you to do otherwise. You're each going to take a spot
324,00:22:08.21,00:22:08.21,in the water underneath a grated steel barrier.
325,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,"As the tide rises, the water will rise."
326,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,"As the water rises, your breathing space will decrease"
327,00:22:18.58,00:22:18.58,until you have nowhere left to breathe.
328,00:22:21.88,00:22:21.88,Your head must stay completely under the grate at all times.
329,00:22:25.33,00:22:25.33,The person who stays in this challenge the longest wins
330,00:22:29.29,00:22:29.29,"immunity, is guaranteed a one in nine shot at a million bucks."
331,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,I'll give you a minute to strategize.
332,00:22:37.17,00:22:37.17,"We'll get started. >> JEFF: All right, here we go."
333,00:22:46.71,00:22:46.71,>> Let's rock 'n' roll. >> JEFF: For individual
334,00:22:48.54,00:22:48.54,immunity. Survivors ready?
335,00:22:50.25,00:22:50.25,>> Ready. >> JEFF: Go.
336,00:22:52.17,00:22:52.17,This challenge is on. ( laughter )
337,00:23:10.71,00:23:10.71,">> Cirie, has the panic set in yet?"
338,00:23:13.04,00:23:13.04,>> Not quite yet. >> Not quite yet.
339,00:23:15.17,00:23:15.17,">> Give me, like, five minutes. Help me."
340,00:23:41.08,00:23:41.08,>> JEFF: Now it's going to start to get interesting.
341,00:23:44.21,00:23:44.21,"That water level starts to creep up, starts covering your ears."
342,00:23:47.50,00:23:47.50,You can't hear anymore. It's going to mean trouble for
343,00:23:51.71,00:23:51.71,people who panic. Amanda is the first out.
344,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,Head popped up behind the grate. You can take a spot on the
345,00:24:02.38,00:24:02.38,"pontoon, Amanda. What happened, Amanda?"
346,00:24:10.17,00:24:10.17,You just weren't paying attention?
347,00:24:11.96,00:24:11.96,">> No, I was, like, relaxed and dozing, and I thought I had more"
348,00:24:14.17,00:24:14.17,space above me than I did. >> JEFF: The water continues to
349,00:24:34.33,00:24:34.33,rise. It's starting to work its way up
350,00:24:36.58,00:24:36.58,your face. Now it's getting close to the
351,00:24:39.21,00:24:39.21,eyes. Your brain is going to tell you
352,00:24:42.54,00:24:42.54,to bail and get out of this. Just mind over matter.
353,00:24:47.08,00:24:47.08,"Remind yourself, you can always take one last deep breath."
354,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,Parvati has had enough. She opts out.
355,00:24:59.25,00:24:59.25,Alexis opts out right behind Parvati.
356,00:25:02.04,00:25:02.04,"Amanda, Parvati, and Alexis the first three out."
357,00:25:12.42,00:25:12.42,Cirie has had enough. Can't take it any longer.
358,00:25:16.00,00:25:16.00,Cirie is out of the challenge. Getting very close now.
359,00:25:27.25,00:25:27.25,Natalie can't take it any longer.
360,00:25:29.33,00:25:29.33,"After lasting nearly 50 minutes, Natalie is out of this"
361,00:25:33.21,00:25:33.21,challenge. We are down to five.
362,00:25:43.17,00:25:43.17,Eliza now completely underwater. Eliza pops up.
363,00:25:51.04,00:25:51.04,Eliza is now out of the challenge.
364,00:25:57.25,00:25:57.25,Erik can't take it any longer. We are now down to three--
365,00:26:00.00,00:26:00.00,"James, Jason, and Ozzy. Three different strategies on"
366,00:26:05.00,00:26:05.00,how to breathe going on. That water is above the grate
367,00:26:23.08,00:26:23.08,now. You have to have your nose and
368,00:26:26.29,00:26:26.29,"mouth through that grate, or you will be underwater."
369,00:26:30.21,00:26:30.21,Amazing. All three of these guys still in
370,00:26:32.50,00:26:32.50,it. >> Yeah.
371,00:26:35.04,00:26:35.04,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: This is going to be a
372,00:26:36.83,00:26:36.83,true test of who wants immunity the most.
373,00:26:57.67,00:26:57.67,">> This is, like, painful. >> It's painful to watch."
374,00:27:01.29,00:27:01.29,>> JEFF: James can't do it any longer.
375,00:27:05.96,00:27:05.96,James is out. We are now down to Jason and
376,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,"Ozzy. >> Come out, Oz."
377,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50,">> JEFF: Ozzy really struggling, but he is back up."
378,00:27:45.54,00:27:45.54,Ozzy comes up. It's over.
379,00:27:47.92,00:27:47.92,Jason wins first individual immunity!
380,00:27:58.62,00:27:58.62,">> Awww! >> JEFF: Jason, congrats."
381,00:28:02.21,00:28:02.21,Come on over. Nice work.
382,00:28:10.58,00:28:10.58,Individual immunity. Safe at tribal council tonight.
383,00:28:13.83,00:28:13.83,"For the other nine of you, not the case."
384,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,Somebody going home. You have the afternoon to figure
385,00:28:18.33,00:28:18.33,out who it's going to be. See you at tribal.
386,00:28:43.21,00:28:43.21,">> Thank you. >> I know, awesome, good job."
387,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,>> Quite exciting getting to beat Ozzy.
388,00:28:49.21,00:28:49.21,"My, quote, like, favorite player in the game, you know, watching"
389,00:28:52.12,00:28:52.12,"him dominate in so many challenges, and then..."
390,00:28:54.50,00:28:54.50,>> Beating him. >> Yep.
391,00:28:56.54,00:28:56.54,">> Knowing if you weren't there, he would have won that one."
392,00:28:58.42,00:28:58.42,>> Yep. Today's immunity challenge I was
393,00:29:01.12,00:29:01.12,"able to win. In fact, I think I actually"
394,00:29:03.29,00:29:03.29,dominated the whole challenge. When I came up and saw the look
395,00:29:06.67,00:29:06.67,"of failure on Ozzy's face, it was pretty delightful."
396,00:29:10.67,00:29:10.67,So being able to dominate Ozzy and then hopefully being able to
397,00:29:15.12,00:29:15.12,send him home later tonight will be one of the highlights of the
398,00:29:18.08,00:29:18.08,game for me. >> Are you kidding?
399,00:29:26.00,00:29:26.00,">> No. Just... I'm always, like... feel"
400,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,like I'm always out of the loop. >> You're definitely in the
401,00:29:33.12,00:29:33.12,loop. >> Eliza has been my biggest
402,00:29:40.38,00:29:40.38,"rival, I think, since the beginning of this game."
403,00:29:42.62,00:29:42.62,She's been running around trying to get me voted out personally
404,00:29:45.33,00:29:45.33,"since day one. I mean, everyone on this tribe"
405,00:29:49.54,00:29:49.54,"is voting for her tonight, as far as I know."
406,00:29:53.21,00:29:53.21,"I wouldn't have trusted her, but if she would have tried to work"
407,00:29:56.38,00:29:56.38,"with me on the other side, it would have been easier."
408,00:30:00.38,00:30:00.38,"But she was trying to get me out the whole time, and then she"
409,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,comes up to me and tries to be loyal.
410,00:30:05.42,00:30:05.42,"I'm like, ""Too little, too late, lady."""
411,00:30:13.79,00:30:13.79,>> Jason. I'm pretty sure they're voting
412,00:30:16.21,00:30:16.21,"for me, so... >> I've got you covered."
413,00:30:19.04,00:30:19.04,Don't worry. >> So we're voting Ozzy?
414,00:30:21.33,00:30:21.33,>> Yes. >> You hid it?
415,00:30:28.12,00:30:28.12,>> Yeah. >> Are you going to get it?
416,00:30:29.62,00:30:29.62,>> Yeah! >> Okay.
417,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,">> Don't worry, baby. >> Okay."
418,00:30:33.21,00:30:33.21,I'm trusting you. >> I'll go get it right now.
419,00:30:36.08,00:30:36.08,>> Okay. My god.
420,00:30:38.75,00:30:38.75,It will literally be the biggest blindside in history.
421,00:30:40.96,00:30:40.96,>> I can't wait to send Ozzy's cocky ass home tonight.
422,00:30:45.54,00:30:45.54,"He's going to be like ""What?"" >> This might make me more hated"
423,00:30:49.96,00:30:49.96,"than Fairplay. Oh, my god!"
424,00:30:52.67,00:30:52.67,I'm so glad you won today. >> I could have been down there
425,00:30:55.58,00:30:55.58,another ten minutes. >> What's Ozzy and Alexis
426,00:31:09.17,00:31:09.17,talking about? >> I don't know.
427,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,">> All of a sudden this set comes in and, boom, just hammers"
428,00:31:13.46,00:31:13.46,me and brings me back on the inside.
429,00:31:16.25,00:31:16.25,">> Alexis is dangerous-- very, very, very, very dangerous."
430,00:31:19.67,00:31:19.67,>> Mm-hmm. >> And she needs to go.
431,00:31:21.54,00:31:21.54,>> I'm cool with that. I mean...
432,00:31:23.33,00:31:23.33,>> First. She needs to go now.
433,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,I don't think I know Ozzy as well as I think I know him.
434,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,">> I keep trying to tell you, missy, he's playing."
435,00:31:29.67,00:31:29.67,">> Well, I'm playing, too. >> I know."
436,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,Amanda seems to believe that we should probably get rid of
437,00:31:36.96,00:31:36.96,"Alexis, and I think a small bit of jealousy is coming into play"
438,00:31:42.54,00:31:42.54,because of the relationship that Ozzy has with Alexis.
439,00:31:46.83,00:31:46.83,Will he vote her? >> Yeah.
440,00:31:49.83,00:31:49.83,"I don't... I think so. >> But as long as it's not me,"
441,00:31:52.71,00:31:52.71,then I'll vote Alexis. >> It's in my bag.
442,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,>> This is so stupid. This is just a napkin.
443,00:32:33.42,00:32:33.42,"Oh, my god. This isn't it."
444,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,"Jason, come here. What are you doing?"
445,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,What are you trying to pull? I'm going home anyhow.
446,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,It's not the idol. >> It is the idol.
447,00:32:58.25,00:32:58.25,">> It's not the idol. >> Yes, it is."
448,00:33:00.38,00:33:00.38,>> Ozzy must have put it in there.
449,00:33:02.12,00:33:02.12,He must have the real thing. That's not the idol.
450,00:33:03.79,00:33:03.79,>> What is it? >> It's a ( no audio ) stick.
451,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,>> I know. It has a face on it.
452,00:33:07.58,00:33:07.58,Don't worry. >> Ozzy put it in there and made
453,00:33:09.29,00:33:09.29,"a face on it. >> No, he didn't."
454,00:33:11.04,00:33:11.04,>> It's not the idol. >> Why do you say that?
455,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,>> Because that can't be the idol.
456,00:33:14.50,00:33:14.50,>> Why not? >> Because it's just a stick.
457,00:33:16.29,00:33:16.29,>> I know. Do you think so?
458,00:33:18.08,00:33:18.08,>> I think that that's not the idol.
459,00:33:20.08,00:33:20.08,">> Then that's a bummer. >> Yeah, of course."
460,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,">> JEFF: Alexis, one of the things that happens when you"
461,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,"merge is it's the first time everybody's together, all at"
462,00:33:56.58,00:33:56.58,once. Gives you the opportunity to
463,00:33:59.08,00:33:59.08,start assessing skills. How much time have you spent
464,00:34:02.04,00:34:02.04,"looking at people that are now new to you thinking, ""This is"
465,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"how they're playing""? >> I think there are three main"
466,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,points that define strength in this game.
467,00:34:11.54,00:34:11.54,"You know, are they a stronger social player?"
468,00:34:13.42,00:34:13.42,Are they a stronger physical player?
469,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,Are they a stronger mental player?
470,00:34:17.04,00:34:17.04,So I think the merge is the first opportunity where you
471,00:34:19.12,00:34:19.12,really get to see your entire competition versus the
472,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,competition within your own tribe.
473,00:34:23.29,00:34:23.29,">> JEFF: Cirie, Alexis brings up three different types of skills."
474,00:34:26.46,00:34:26.46,What skills do you see that Alexis has?
475,00:34:29.17,00:34:29.17,">> So far, I'd say Alexis has all three."
476,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,"Socially around camp, physically during the challenges, and she's"
477,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,"mentally strong. So I think she's, like, a triple"
478,00:34:40.96,00:34:40.96,threat. Sorry.
479,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,">> JEFF: Alexis, is that a little worrisome to be outed as"
480,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,a triple threat? >> I don't think at this point
481,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,"in the game. I mean, there's ten people left"
482,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,"out of 20, so I think there are several people here left who"
483,00:34:55.46,00:34:55.46,maintain a triple threat. I don't think you make it this
484,00:34:58.96,00:34:58.96,"far if you're not mentally, physically, socially"
485,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,competitive. >> JEFF: You talk about your
486,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,skill list. Tell me about Eliza's skills.
487,00:35:06.75,00:35:06.75,>> I think that Eliza played an incredible physical and mental
488,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,game. I don't think she played as well
489,00:35:13.04,00:35:13.04,"a social game. >> JEFF: You say ""Played."""
490,00:35:15.71,00:35:15.71,">> Pardon me? >> You said it in past tense, as"
491,00:35:20.46,00:35:20.46,"if I've already been voted out. >> Okay, I'm sorry."
492,00:35:23.62,00:35:23.62,">> It's okay. >> JEFF: Eliza, do you agree"
493,00:35:25.71,00:35:25.71,with that? Are you strong and weak as she
494,00:35:27.96,00:35:27.96,says? >> Alexis' assessment was
495,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,probably right on. I think that my social game
496,00:35:33.75,00:35:33.75,potentially has been lacking. But I think that a lot of people
497,00:35:37.96,00:35:37.96,"here are playing a very short- sighted game, and not really"
498,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,looking down the line. So they're overestimating their
499,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,"own social game, I think. >> JEFF: So, Ozzy, there's two"
500,00:35:48.92,00:35:48.92,sides of this social skill. There's the side that's
501,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,threatening because the person is very good socially.
502,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,The other side is the person is so bad socially that maybe you
503,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,"keep them around. >> Yeah, you take someone who"
504,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,"nobody likes to the end, and you win."
505,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,>> That's the way to win Survivor.
506,00:36:05.17,00:36:05.17,There's no book to win Survivor.
507,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,That's the schedule. Get the one that everybody hates
508,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,"and keep them along, yeah. >> JEFF: Eliza, you can't miss"
509,00:36:12.50,00:36:12.50,your eyes when they roll. Do you think you're liked?
510,00:36:15.46,00:36:15.46,">> No, not really. >> She's liked."
511,00:36:17.62,00:36:17.62,">> No, I'm not really liked. >> Well, Eliza, you've been"
512,00:36:20.04,00:36:20.04,running around back and forth trying to vote me out since day
513,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,"one, then coming back to me yesterday telling me you're"
514,00:36:25.38,00:36:25.38,"going to be 100% loyal to me, that we need to stay true to the"
515,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,old Malakal tribe and favorites to the end.
516,00:36:31.08,00:36:31.08,Are you kidding me? People are going to believe you?
517,00:36:33.75,00:36:33.75,>> That's not true. Everyone is saying we would
518,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,"stick together, we would stick together."
519,00:36:37.88,00:36:37.88,>> But what were you trying to do to me the first day?
520,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,What were you trying to do to me?
521,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,>> I was not trying to do anything to you.
522,00:36:43.25,00:36:43.25,">> I just can't sit here and be quiet anymore, because it's..."
523,00:36:45.25,00:36:45.25,"it's just too much for me. >> JEFF: Eliza, welcome to"
524,00:36:50.04,00:36:50.04,tribal council. No free rides.
525,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,">> I mean, I definitely got myself into this mess."
526,00:36:55.88,00:36:55.88,But everyone is here to win a million dollars.
527,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,"I mean, you know, people have come awfully close and lost"
528,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,because they went up against the best.
529,00:37:04.79,00:37:04.79,"You know, so it's, like, are you really going to make the same"
530,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,"mistake again? I mean, bring people people"
531,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"don't like to the finals with you, and have a shot, plain and"
532,00:37:12.54,00:37:12.54,"simple. >> JEFF: All right, it is time"
533,00:37:16.33,00:37:16.33,"to get to the vote. Jason, you have the individual"
534,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,immunity necklace. If at any time you want to
535,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"assign it to someone else, whether at the beach or here at"
536,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"tribal council, you can do that. >> You know, I feel like I have"
537,00:37:28.42,00:37:28.42,no alliances at the new Dabu tribe.
538,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,I don't think anyone had a conversation with me the entire
539,00:37:33.29,00:37:33.29,afternoon. >> JEFF: So Jason is clearly not
540,00:37:36.12,00:37:36.12,going to give up the necklace. You cannot vote for Jason.
541,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
542,00:37:41.54,00:37:41.54,"Amanda, you're up. >> I hope something miraculous"
543,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,"happens with the stick and you're voted out, not me."
544,00:38:13.29,00:38:13.29,>> It was your bad luck to pick the wrong girl to mess with.
545,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,Hope you learn from your mistakes the second time around.
546,00:38:29.67,00:38:29.67,>> Tonight my vote is for Ozzy. Hopefully what I gave Eliza is
547,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,the real hidden immunity idol. I can't wait to see the look on
548,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,your face if it is you. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the
549,00:38:52.62,00:38:52.62,votes. If anybody has the hidden
550,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
551,00:39:05.79,00:39:05.79,to do so. The rules of Survivor state that
552,00:39:33.58,00:39:33.58,"if a hidden immunity idol is played, then any votes cast"
553,00:39:37.88,00:39:37.88,"against that person do not count, and the person with the"
554,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,next highest number of votes would be voted out.
555,00:39:48.08,00:39:48.08,This is not a hidden immunity idol.
556,00:39:51.00,00:39:51.00,>> That means Ozzy has it. Jason found it on Exile.
557,00:39:54.08,00:39:54.08,"Ozzy has the real one. >> Sorry, I couldn't tell you"
558,00:39:56.83,00:39:56.83,"guys, but... >> But it was worth a shot."
559,00:39:59.04,00:39:59.04,">> Jeff, come on. That took hours to make."
560,00:40:10.04,00:40:10.04,">> JEFF: Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
