65,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,is like first class. Some positions are more
66,00:03:54.00,00:03:54.00,"desirable than others, because the wind comes generally from"

68,00:04:00.79,00:04:00.79,one edge of the fire. Bubba just would not give up

91,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,language that I have no idea. The one thing we could kind of
92,00:05:24.17,00:05:24.17,pick out is that he wanted us to establish a-a leader.
93,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83,( speaking native language ) >> One chief...
94,00:05:29.88,00:05:29.88,>> Who's chief? >> I guess he wants

102,00:05:51.17,00:05:51.17,"me a chief staff, and then he puts the chief, uh, emblem"
103,00:05:54.29,00:05:54.29,around my neck. Then he turns around and gets in
104,00:06:03.88,00:06:03.88,"his boat, and we're, like, ""I guess I'm not going with him."""
105,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,>> What the hell's going on today?

112,00:06:27.79,00:06:27.79,She's definitely our chief. She's the oldest.
113,00:06:32.12,00:06:32.12,She's the wisest. I think it was obvious for all
114,00:06:34.08,00:06:34.08,of us. >> That's it?
115,00:06:35.79,00:06:35.79,Uh-oh. >> Uh-oh.

164,00:09:15.21,00:09:15.21,"Because there is one extra woman, one woman will not be"
165,00:09:17.92,00:09:17.92,chosen. We'll deal with that later.
166,00:09:20.33,00:09:20.33,"Once the tribes have been divided, the other leader will"
167,00:09:23.75,00:09:23.75,choose which tribe they want to take back with them to their
168,00:09:26.62,00:09:26.62,"beach. To make things fair, we'll rock,"
169,00:09:30.08,00:09:30.08,"paper, scissor to see who gets to divide the tribes and who"
170,00:09:34.25,00:09:34.25,"gets to choose. >> One, two, three."

381,00:23:35.38,00:23:35.38,willing to please. Right now they're just like
382,00:23:37.62,00:23:37.62,whatever it takes to get it done.
383,00:23:39.62,00:23:39.62,>> We going to show them how to do the coconut?
384,00:23:42.00,00:23:42.00,"Hey, did y'all see how...? >> Why?"
385,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,>> Huh? >> Why?
386,00:23:46.21,00:23:46.21,>> Why what? We've been showing the guys all
387,00:23:56.29,00:23:56.29,"kinds of stuff, and I said, ""Oh, I'm going to show them how"
388,00:23:58.71,00:23:58.71,"to crack the coconut."" Ami was, like, ""Why?"""
389,00:24:01.17,00:24:01.17,Because to show them how to do it-- it's cool.
390,00:24:03.50,00:24:03.50,"Well, why would you want to do that?"
391,00:24:06.12,00:24:06.12,"You know, I'm like... why not?"
392,00:24:08.50,00:24:08.50,">> You want to teach them, teach them."
393,00:24:11.00,00:24:11.00,>> I think it's kind of cool.
394,00:24:15.08,00:24:15.08,>> I was so happy that Rory and Bubba started lifting stuff
395,00:24:18.88,00:24:18.88,and moving stuff and doing stuff.
396,00:24:20.25,00:24:20.25,What I got irritated with was I saw a little bit of our bond
397,00:24:24.25,00:24:24.25,disappear. The girls were so excited to
398,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,show them everything. I just don't think it's really
399,00:24:28.17,00:24:28.17,that important that we show them all of our secrets.
400,00:24:30.50,00:24:30.50,We're definitely still five women strong.
401,00:24:32.71,00:24:32.71,That's not going to change; at least on my end it's not going
402,00:24:35.29,00:24:35.29,to change. I'm sticking by the ladies.
403,00:24:37.58,00:24:37.58,"So, they really need to prove themselves."
404,00:24:40.12,00:24:40.12,"Otherwise, they're out of here. There we go."
405,00:25:04.50,00:25:04.50,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get to today's immunity challenge."
406,00:25:07.38,00:25:07.38,First things first. Scout.
407,00:25:16.00,00:25:16.00,">> Chris, think about the merge."
408,00:25:20.54,00:25:20.54,>> PROBST: Immunity-- back up for grabs.
409,00:25:23.21,00:25:23.21,Let me explain how it's going to work.
410,00:25:25.21,00:25:25.21,"You're going to race into the jungle, collecting pieces to"
411,00:25:28.12,00:25:28.12,build an outrigger canoe. Both tribes will start with your
412,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,canoe on the beach. Two tribe members will go into
413,00:25:33.88,00:25:33.88,"the jungle, untie the frame, bring it back."
414,00:25:36.58,00:25:36.58,"The next two tribe members will go deeper into the jungle, untie"
415,00:25:39.71,00:25:39.71,"two paddles, bring them back. The last two tribe members will"
416,00:25:44.08,00:25:44.08,"go even further into the jungle, untie the outrigger, bring it"
417,00:25:47.04,00:25:47.04,back. Once you've gathered all the
418,00:25:49.54,00:25:49.54,"pieces on the beach, you can begin to assemble the outrigger."
419,00:25:52.21,00:25:52.21,"Two tribe members will then paddle out, retrieve the tribe"
420,00:25:55.46,00:25:55.46,"flag, come back to the beach. Your outrigger must hit the"
421,00:25:59.17,00:25:59.17,final marker pole on your way back.
422,00:26:01.46,00:26:01.46,First tribe with all six tribe members and their tribe flag on
423,00:26:04.71,00:26:04.71,"the mat wins immunity. The losers-- Tribal Council, and"
424,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,this game will be over tonight for somebody.
425,00:26:12.21,00:26:12.21,"Yasur, you have one extra tribe member, got to sit somebody out."
426,00:26:15.04,00:26:15.04,Bubba sat out yesterday. Who's sitting out today?
427,00:26:17.25,00:26:17.25,">> I'll sit out. >> PROBST: Scout, you're going"
428,00:26:19.42,00:26:19.42,"to sit this one out. Everybody else take your spots,"
429,00:26:22.08,00:26:22.08,"wait for my go. Here we go, for immunity."
430,00:26:27.12,00:26:27.12,Survivors ready. Go!
431,00:26:41.12,00:26:41.12,Sarge and Twila attacking the knots.
432,00:26:46.25,00:26:46.25,Bubba with the first knot undone.
433,00:26:47.71,00:26:47.71,">> Pull, pull, pull it out. You got to start pulling the"
434,00:26:50.08,00:26:50.08,other one. >> PROBST: One knot left in the

440,00:27:13.12,00:27:13.12,"mat. Ami, you hit the mat, too."
441,00:27:15.00,00:27:15.00,">> PROBST: Next two-- go, go, go!"

447,00:27:38.21,00:27:38.21,She's helping Eliza. We're dead even.
448,00:27:43.12,00:27:43.12,Chad and Julie are out. Leann and Eliza right behind.

457,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,ground. Still very tight.
458,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,John getting very close. Rory falling a bit behind.
459,00:28:32.75,00:28:32.75,Rory going to have to make up a lot of ground for Yasur.

465,00:28:48.75,00:28:48.75,They're heading back to the beach.
466,00:28:50.21,00:28:50.21,>> Steady pace; I'm right behind you.

484,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,We can't go no farther. >> Go; push the other

524,00:32:06.42,00:32:06.42,Somebody's going to pay for it tonight.
525,00:32:08.12,00:32:08.12,See you at Tribal Council. Head back to camp.

528,00:32:41.04,00:32:41.04,got to go. I feel the women of Yasur are
529,00:32:44.83,00:32:44.83,going to vote as a solid block. I feel extremely vulnerable.
530,00:32:49.96,00:32:49.96,The only thing I can do is assume the worst and hope for
531,00:32:53.67,00:32:53.67,the best and pray to God that I'm here tomorrow.
532,00:32:56.33,00:32:56.33,>> What did we look like out there?
533,00:32:58.25,00:32:58.25,"Did we look like total idiots, or what?"
534,00:33:04.08,00:33:04.08,I'm annoyed as hell with Bubba right now.
535,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,"The second that we arrived at our challenge, I see Bubba"
536,00:33:09.38,00:33:09.38,"making signals to Chris. He was communicating completely,"
537,00:33:12.42,00:33:12.42,"and Chris was nodding like, ""Yep, that's right."
538,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,"Yep, that's right."" Bubba was not helping me one"
539,00:33:18.33,00:33:18.33,bit. >> No.

541,00:33:21.58,00:33:21.58,>> Was he trying to tell... >> Yes.
542,00:33:24.38,00:33:24.38,I saw him talking to Chris. I just watched it happen the
543,00:33:27.67,00:33:27.67,whole time. It was disgusting.
544,00:33:31.21,00:33:31.21,People will...  people will get
545,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,themselves kicked out. You don't have kick them out.
546,00:33:34.25,00:33:34.25,They'll get themselves kicked out.
547,00:33:35.88,00:33:35.88,"I don't know exactly how the other girls are voting, but I"
548,00:33:38.04,00:33:38.04,definitely have my vote. Bubba is not part of the tribe.
549,00:33:41.75,00:33:41.75,He's making plans with the other team.
550,00:33:43.46,00:33:43.46,That's... Can you see Michael Jordan
551,00:33:45.33,00:33:45.33,whispering over to the other team what their next play is?
552,00:33:47.96,00:33:47.96,"Hell, no. He is not on our team."
553,00:33:50.92,00:33:50.92,He's out. I'm done with him.
554,00:33:52.42,00:33:52.42,>> What do you guys want to eat?

558,00:34:08.62,00:34:08.62,"him to think of the merge. Because if, uh, they win all"
559,00:34:11.96,00:34:11.96,"these immunity challenges, the women are going to have the"
560,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,"advantage during the merge, and they're going to pick the guys"
561,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,"off one by one. But, who knows, I may have got"
562,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,caught with my hands in the cookie jar.
563,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,>> Losing sure does take it out of you.
564,00:34:24.08,00:34:24.08,>> It took the wind out of my sails.
565,00:34:27.12,00:34:27.12,"If y'all choose me, will you tell me before I go?"
566,00:34:30.21,00:34:30.21,>> I don't know. You have to ask the boss.
567,00:34:32.71,00:34:32.71,">> I just said, ""If you choose..."
568,00:34:34.54,00:34:34.54,"could you tell me before I go?"""
569,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,">> Ask everybody, you'll find... everyone knows."
570,00:34:42.88,00:34:42.88,>> I didn't... I didn't say that.
571,00:34:44.88,00:34:44.88,I just said if y'all choose I'd like to know before I go.
572,00:34:47.08,00:34:47.08,"I just don't want to get blindsided, you know what I'm"
573,00:34:48.92,00:34:48.92,"saying? You know, that's all I ask."
574,00:34:51.17,00:34:51.17,I wasn't asking for you to vote either way.
575,00:34:53.71,00:34:53.71,"I just would like to know. >> Yeah, no, I hear you."
576,00:35:00.92,00:35:00.92,">> Ami noticed Bubba making, uh, hand signals and"
577,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,"working with the other team trying to signal them something,"
578,00:35:08.29,00:35:08.29,"so, how do you feel about that, little one?"
579,00:35:10.04,00:35:10.04,>> I'm worried that we're shooting ourselves in the
580,00:35:13.08,00:35:13.08,"foot, you know. >> Yeah."
581,00:35:15.75,00:35:15.75,>> I just think it's going to be...
582,00:35:17.54,00:35:17.54,I just think it's going to get harder.
583,00:35:19.29,00:35:19.29,I don't know. >> Okay.
584,00:35:21.42,00:35:21.42,>> It's definitely dangerous to vote the guys off.
585,00:35:23.58,00:35:23.58,These challenges are going to be physical and we are going to
586,00:35:25.58,00:35:25.58,need their strength. I don't want to vote off Bubba
587,00:35:27.92,00:35:27.92,or Rory. We like them both a lot.
588,00:35:30.08,00:35:30.08,"I think we could... potentially,"
589,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"like, we're already down four guys to two."
590,00:35:34.12,00:35:34.12,Now we're going to be down to just one guy on our team and
591,00:35:36.96,00:35:36.96,then we're going to have really physical challenges and...
592,00:35:39.08,00:35:39.08,What? >> We're not going to kick
593,00:35:41.46,00:35:41.46,"one of us off. >> Thank you, Lord, for"
594,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,everything that you've done for us.
595,00:36:05.04,00:36:05.04,Thank you for all the opportunities that you've given
596,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,us and thank you for the beautiful days on Vanuatu.
597,00:36:10.04,00:36:10.04,"Thank you, Lord, thank you. Amen."
598,00:36:13.50,00:36:13.50,"You know I love you, brother. >> I love you, too, bro."
599,00:36:41.08,00:36:41.08,>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
600,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,Let's go back to when we switched.
601,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,"Lisa, after being women and men this long, is this truly one"
602,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,"new tribe now? >> Well, we've tried to"
603,00:36:51.00,00:36:51.00,"make them as welcome in the tribe, and we actually have"
604,00:36:54.08,00:36:54.08,enjoyed having two men around. Feels like they have been with
605,00:36:57.08,00:36:57.08,"us forever, and I've personally enjoyed it a lot."
606,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,">> PROBST: Leann, what's the reaction on a split?"
607,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"Is it, ""All right, this is the tribe I'm on now and who knows"
608,00:37:04.88,00:37:04.88,"what's coming next?"" >> I think it's really"
609,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33,"difficult after 11 days of bonding with all these women,"
610,00:37:10.62,00:37:10.62,"and I'm not going to lie, I haven't made the switch."
611,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,>> PROBST: So it's still men versus women for you?
612,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,">> Yes, it is. >> PROBST: Ami, are they equal"
613,00:37:19.12,00:37:19.12,"members, even though there are five women and two men?"
614,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,>> This morning I thought we were one team.
615,00:37:24.50,00:37:24.50,I was excited about the challenge.
616,00:37:26.21,00:37:26.21,"I was ready to go, and I see Bubba making signals to Chris,"
617,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,"and the second I saw that signal, I'm like, we're not a"
618,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,team; this is not a team here. That... I-I saw it happen.
619,00:37:36.33,00:37:36.33,">> PROBST: So, Bubba, at today's immunity challenge, you tried to"
620,00:37:39.67,00:37:39.67,get a signal or you gave a signal?
621,00:37:41.38,00:37:41.38,>> I was trying to get a signal to let me know if they
622,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,were going to play it to win or they were going to strategize
623,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,trying to get more men into the merge.
624,00:37:49.21,00:37:49.21,>> PROBST: What were you hoping to get back?
625,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,>> Just a... a thumbs up
626,00:37:53.17,00:37:53.17,or a smile or a wave-- something.
627,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,I took a chance. It was a big gamble.
628,00:37:57.25,00:37:57.25,>> We had all intentions on winning.
629,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,">> And you weren't going to be the one that we had picked,"
630,00:38:02.12,00:38:02.12,"if we did lose, to go. >> PROBST: Rory, a little"
631,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,"worried on your end, then? >> The fact of the matter"
632,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,"is, Jeff, the only thing that could have changed our fate is"
633,00:38:12.92,00:38:12.92,for Yasur to have won immunity today.
634,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,That's the only thing that was going to stop one of us two from
635,00:38:19.75,00:38:19.75,"leaving tonight. >> PROBST: Ami, is it a little"
636,00:38:22.38,00:38:22.38,difficult for you to know you're going to sacrifice both these
637,00:38:25.71,00:38:25.71,guys when they really didn't do anything other than end up on
638,00:38:28.29,00:38:28.29,"the wrong end of the buff? >> Yeah, it's a little"
639,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,"difficult for me, but I'm glad-- sorry to say this, guys-- but"
640,00:38:34.42,00:38:34.42,I'm glad that we have them and it's not Twila or Jules that are
641,00:38:38.04,00:38:38.04,"going home tonight. >> PROBST: Bubba, so why should"
642,00:38:41.25,00:38:41.25,they keep you? >> Because I-I busted my
643,00:38:44.71,00:38:44.71,butt trying to win. I almost drowned when I was a
644,00:38:47.33,00:38:47.33,kid in the ocean. I never set foot in the ocean
645,00:38:49.12,00:38:49.12,"till I got here. Six weeks I came here, I learned"
646,00:38:51.67,00:38:51.67,how to swim. So you know me getting my butt
647,00:38:54.46,00:38:54.46,"in that boat was making a big step, so I am a team player."
648,00:38:57.88,00:38:57.88,"It's just, I made a mistake. If you need to win challenges"
649,00:39:00.92,00:39:00.92,"and stuff, you know beyond a shadow of a doubt, I'm going to"
650,00:39:03.12,00:39:03.12,"bust my butt to do it. >> PROBST: Rory, why Bubba and"
651,00:39:05.25,00:39:05.25,not you? >> These women know where
652,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,"my heart is, and they know that if anybody is capable of being"
653,00:39:11.54,00:39:11.54,"110% part of this team, it's me."
654,00:39:15.08,00:39:15.08,"I go down with my ship, and if I can't break into that union of"
655,00:39:19.25,00:39:19.25,"women, of the sisters, then I'm going to take my lumps."
656,00:39:22.17,00:39:22.17,I'm man enough to do that. >> I just wanted to say
657,00:39:24.92,00:39:24.92,when I... initially divided up
658,00:39:26.17,00:39:26.17,"the teams, there were three guys that I really wanted to play the"
659,00:39:29.17,00:39:29.17,"game with, and these are two of them, and, uh, the game ain't"
660,00:39:33.62,00:39:33.62,over till the fat lady sings. >> PROBST: It is time to vote.
661,00:39:39.08,00:39:39.08,"Leann, you're up. >> Bubba, you know you're"
662,00:39:54.83,00:39:54.83,my brother. We were just put in an awkward
663,00:39:57.04,00:39:57.04,situation where it was going to be you or I.
664,00:40:08.21,00:40:08.21,">> Rory, I picked you, and, uh, go get him, girls."
665,00:40:20.25,00:40:20.25,">> Sorry, Bubba, you know why."
666,00:40:37.17,00:40:37.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
667,00:40:48.96,00:40:48.96,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
668,00:40:50.67,00:40:50.67,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
669,00:40:52.38,00:40:52.38,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
670,00:40:57.21,00:40:57.21,First vote... Travis-- Bubba.
671,00:41:02.54,00:41:02.54,"Rory. One vote Bubba, one vote Rory."
672,00:41:09.12,00:41:09.12,Bubba. That's two Bubba.
673,00:41:14.96,00:41:14.96,Bubba. That's three votes Bubba.
674,00:41:19.04,00:41:19.04,The sixth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu...
675,00:41:21.38,00:41:21.38,Bubba. That's four votes.
676,00:41:23.04,00:41:23.04,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
677,00:41:33.08,00:41:33.08,"Bubba, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
678,00:41:39.17,00:41:39.17,">> Peace out, y'all. >> PROBST: Well, Yasur is now"
679,00:41:51.12,00:41:51.12,"down to six members, same number as Lopevi."
680,00:41:53.12,00:41:53.12,"The question is, will the women stay united?"
681,00:41:56.25,00:41:56.25,"Will there be a merge? A lot of questions, a lot of"
682,00:41:58.25,00:41:58.25,"game left. Grab your torches, head back to"

686,00:42:16.67,00:42:16.67,Next time on Survivor: >> I will not...
687,00:42:18.25,00:42:18.25,>> PROBST: Rory makes a daring move.
688,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,>> ...continue to slave around camp if I do not have a
689,00:42:22.83,00:42:22.83,shot at making it through Tribal Council.
690,00:42:24.83,00:42:24.83,"My speech was so cheesy, I couldn't even believe I was"
691,00:42:27.71,00:42:27.71,saying it. >> PROBST: And the clothes come
692,00:42:30.17,00:42:30.17,off at Lopevi. >> I think the coed thing
693,00:42:31.96,00:42:31.96,is working really well for our tribe now.
694,00:42:40.08,00:42:40.08,>> I had a great time playing.
695,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,Got in trouble throwing a little signal.
696,00:42:44.21,00:42:44.21,I think the Yankees are going to give me a job to work first base
697,00:42:46.83,00:42:46.83,so I can send some signals. It really shocked me how close
698,00:42:49.71,00:42:49.71,you can become with a person when you're with them that long.
699,00:42:53.00,00:42:53.00,"And one thing I learned, the important thing is what you have"
