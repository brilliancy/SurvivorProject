547,00:35:00.90,00:35:00.90,"KNEW IT. >> Jeff: JOSH, SAME QUESTION."
548,00:35:03.70,00:35:03.70,JEREMY CLEARLY THOUGHT I NEEDED IT TONIGHT.
549,00:35:05.97,00:35:05.97,DID YOU FEEL THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
550,00:35:07.17,00:35:07.17,>> ABSOLUTE. I KNEW MY NAME WAS BEING TOSSED
551,00:35:08.87,00:35:08.87,AROUND SO I KNEW I NEEDED IT FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE.
552,00:35:12.27,00:35:12.27,">> Jeff: WES, ARE THE ALLIANCES KNOWN?"
553,00:35:14.10,00:35:14.10,>> I THINK THE ALLIANCES ARE KNOWN.
554,00:35:15.53,00:35:15.53,"I MEAN, ME, JOSH, REED, AND ALEC TEAMED UP WITH DAD, AND I FELT"
555,00:35:20.07,00:35:20.07,LIKE IT WAS KNOWN TO PEOPLE THAT WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER TYPE.
556,00:35:24.13,00:35:24.13,">> Jeff: JEREMY, DOES THAT LEAVE YOU NATALIE, MISSY,"
557,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,"BAYLOR, JACLYN AND JON TOGETHER? >> IT COULD."
558,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,"I'M NOT SURE. >> Jeff: JACLYN, YOU'RE A PART"
559,00:35:35.97,00:35:35.97,OF A LOVE PAIR. WHERE DOES DOES THAT LEAVE AND
560,00:35:39.27,00:35:39.27,"YOU JON IN TERMS OF ALLIANCES? >> WELL, JON AND ME HAVE BEEN"
561,00:35:42.60,00:35:42.60,APPROACHED BY BOTH SIDES SO THAT KIND OF PUTS US IN THE MIDDLE OF
562,00:35:46.97,00:35:46.97,"EVERYTHING, WHICH IS INTERESTING."
563,00:35:49.03,00:35:49.03,>> Jeff: JON HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
564,00:35:50.77,00:35:50.77,THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TRIBALS NOW THAT YOU AND JACLYN HAVE BEEN
565,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03,SORT OF THE SWING. >> I CAN TELL YOU THAT'S THAT'S
566,00:35:55.27,00:35:55.27,NOT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT OURSELVES IN.
567,00:35:57.53,00:35:57.53,BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE SOMETHING PAINTED ON US THAT IS
568,00:36:01.47,00:36:01.47,"LIKE LIKE, ""TALK TO US, AND WE MIGHT HELP YOU."""
569,00:36:04.23,00:36:04.23,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK IT IS BUT--
570,00:36:06.33,00:36:06.33,">> I DON'T KNOW. >> Jeff: NATALIE, WHEN YOU SEE"
571,00:36:09.10,00:36:09.10,"THAT JON'S GETTING APPROACHED BYE EVERYBODY, WHAT'S THE PLAY?"
572,00:36:13.67,00:36:13.67,BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY GOT A PRETTY GOOD PITCH.
573,00:36:15.60,00:36:15.60,">> IT'S SO WEIRD, BUT I FEEL ALMOST PROTECTIVE OVER THE"
574,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,ORIGINAL HUNAHPU. AND JON IS SMIB FELT I COULD
575,00:36:27.07,00:36:27.07,TRUST SO YOU NEED TO PICK A SIDE AND TRUST MOVINGED FOR.
576,00:36:31.50,00:36:31.50,"THE FUNNY THING IS, THOSE GUYS WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR JACLYN, BUT"
577,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,"WHEN JON IS NOT THERE, THE BEHAVIOR SEEMS THEY DON'T EVEN"
578,00:36:38.77,00:36:38.77,NEED JACLYN-- >> WHICH IS SO FRUSTRATING TO
579,00:36:41.90,00:36:41.90,"ME. EVERYONE GOES TO JON, AND THEN"
580,00:36:43.50,00:36:43.50,"WHEN HE WENT TO EXILE, NOBODY REALLY CARED TO CAMPAIGN WITH"
581,00:36:46.27,00:36:46.27,"ME, AND THE SECOND HE GOT BACK TODAY, IT WAS ALL ABOUT JON."
582,00:36:49.93,00:36:49.93,"AND, YOU KNOW, ME AND JON TALK. WE MAKE DECISION TOGETHER."
583,00:36:52.83,00:36:52.83,SO PEOPLE SHHH MAYBE BE SMARTER ABOUT THAT.
584,00:36:57.10,00:36:57.10,>> Jeff: DO YOU NOT FEEL RESPECTED OUT HERE?
585,00:36:59.37,00:36:59.37,">> MAYBE BY A FEW PEOPLE, YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT A LITTLE BIT."
586,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,">> I CAN LAY THIS OUT FOR YOU. OKAY, SO I'M WATCHING A COUPLE"
587,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13,OF THESE YOUNGER GUYS PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE IN A FRAT HOUSE.
588,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,>> Jeff: YOU HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT WES AND ALEC.
589,00:37:10.57,00:37:10.57,">> YOU GOT IT. AND THEY LITERALLY BELCH, FART,"
590,00:37:14.27,00:37:14.27,"SPIT, THEY DON'T CARE IF THERE ARE FEMALES THERE OR NOT."
591,00:37:17.50,00:37:17.50,">> BUT WE'RE NOT AT THE HILTON, MISSY."
592,00:37:20.20,00:37:20.20,"AND I HAVEN'T HEARD WESLEY FART, OR SPIT."
593,00:37:24.07,00:37:24.07,BUT I'VE HAY LITTLE BIT OF GAS. I'M SURE EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL
594,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,HAS HAD GAS. IT'S JUST A NORMAL BODY
595,00:37:30.17,00:37:30.17,"FUNCTION. THIS IS ""SURVIVOR"" AND STUFF"
596,00:37:31.30,00:37:31.30,LIKE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE GOING TO GET DIRTY.
597,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,YOU'RE GOING TO GET NORTHWEST. YOU'RE GOING TO GET GAS.
598,00:37:37.23,00:37:37.23,>> Jeff: REED IT'S A FASCINATING THING TO WATCH
599,00:37:39.60,00:37:39.60,TONIGHT BECAUSE PERCEPTION IS REALITY TO THE PERCEIVER.
600,00:37:42.97,00:37:42.97,"IF SOMEBODY BELIEVES THEY'RE BEING DISRESPECTED, LIKE JACLYN,"
601,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,ARE YOU THAT WAY TO THEM. >> I THINK I'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT
602,00:37:48.63,00:37:48.63,RESPECTFUL TO THE WOMEN OUT HERE.
603,00:37:49.73,00:37:49.73,BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE I MOMENT TO GO BACK TO WHEN
604,00:37:52.13,00:37:52.13,"NATALIE PITCHED HER CASE TO JON AND JACLYN, AND I THINK IT WOULD"
605,00:37:54.87,00:37:54.87,BE JUST AS VALUABLE FOR US TO GET A CHANCE.
606,00:37:57.47,00:37:57.47,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, REED, MAKE YOUR CASE."
607,00:37:59.33,00:37:59.33,">> I JUST THINK YOU GUYS ARE BOTH VERY POWERFUL, AND YOU'RE"
608,00:38:03.30,00:38:03.30,STRONG TOGETHER. YOU'RE BOTH THREATS IN
609,00:38:05.80,00:38:05.80,CHALLENGES. SO IF YOU SIDE WITH A GROUP OF
610,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,"SINGLES, WHAT'S TO SAY THEY DON'T TURN RIGHT BACK AROUND OW"
611,00:38:11.73,00:38:11.73,"AND VOTE YOU GUYS OUT. >> OKAY, WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYING"
612,00:38:14.70,00:38:14.70,YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING TO TURN AROUND AND GET HIM OUT BECAUSE
613,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,JONL IS THE BIGGEST THREAT? >> ABSOLUTE NOT.
614,00:38:19.33,00:38:19.33,">> ALL RIGHT. >> Jeff: JON, YOU'RE BEING"
615,00:38:22.27,00:38:22.27,"PITCHED FROM TWO GROUPS, A GROUP OF FIVE AND A GROUP OF FOUR."
616,00:38:26.00,00:38:26.00,WOULD YOU RATHER YOU GUYS WEREN'T THE LINCHPIN?
617,00:38:29.40,00:38:29.40,">> I THINK RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE IT'S POSITIVE BECAUSE I"
618,00:38:33.20,00:38:33.20,"FEEL LIKE JACLYN AND I ARE KIND OF CONTROLLING OUR OWN FATE, BUT"
619,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"THESE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING, THEY'RE GAME CHANGERS, AND THAT"
620,00:38:39.83,00:38:39.83,CAN BE SCARY. >> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
621,00:38:45.63,00:38:45.63,"IT IS TIME TO VOTE. REED, YOU'RE UP."
622,00:39:04.27,00:39:04.27,>> SORRY YOU CAN'T HANDLE HANGING OUT WITH THE BIG BOYS.
623,00:39:19.03,00:39:19.03,">> YOU'RE A STRONG PLAYER, BUT I STOPPED TRUSTING YOU WHEN YOU"
624,00:39:22.87,00:39:22.87,WROTE MY NAME DOWN THE FIRST TRIBAL AND DIDN'T TELL ME.
625,00:39:48.03,00:39:48.03,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
626,00:39:59.60,00:39:59.60,"IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,"
627,00:40:02.90,00:40:02.90,NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO. OKAY.
628,00:40:10.27,00:40:10.27,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
629,00:40:12.07,00:40:12.07,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

659,00:42:46.40,00:42:46.40,"LITTLE TOO MUCH OF WHO I WAS OUT HERE, AND THAT SENT ME PACKING."
660,00:42:51.17,00:42:51.17,SO I'M THANKFUL THAT I GOT THIS FAR IN THIS GAME AND GOT THIS
