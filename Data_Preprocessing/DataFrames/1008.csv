65,00:04:25.08,00:04:25.08,"better than Ibrehemat challenges, so... I did what"
66,00:04:27.88,00:04:27.88,was best for the tribe.>> I'm glad that we're still

72,00:04:42.92,00:04:42.92,"I'm still ready to win,and it's clear now"
73,00:04:45.88,00:04:45.88,that Bobby Jon and Iare the two people

81,00:05:39.04,00:05:39.04,gotten sloppy with foodor we're cutting the coconuts
82,00:05:41.46,00:05:41.46,too close to the camp or...I just think it's that the rats
83,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,have got comfortable with usand realize that we're not
84,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,a threat to them.>> The rats have become
85,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,"bolder and bolder, and it's allour tribe's fault because nobody"
86,00:05:56.58,00:05:56.58,"will listen to me.There's coconut everywhere,"
87,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,so of course the rats are goingto become more and more bold.
88,00:06:00.96,00:06:00.96,"They're eating our coconut,which is all over the camp"
89,00:06:03.21,00:06:03.21,because people won't clean up.So every bit of rat that we get
90,00:06:05.75,00:06:05.75,all over us is deserved.>> You are?
91,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,">> Uh, I'm not smellingit anymore."
92,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83,I've told people for days.I have told Tom every day

94,00:06:17.29,00:06:17.29,"because it stinks,there's flies everywhere."
95,00:06:19.17,00:06:19.17,It's not even 20 feetfrom our camp.
96,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"So I got up this morning,I moved the shark head,"
97,00:06:23.21,00:06:23.21,"I moved the guts because nobodywas doing anything, as usual."
98,00:06:25.29,00:06:25.29,"I'm the one who has to get thefirewood, I'm the one who has to"
99,00:06:27.54,00:06:27.54,"keep the fire going, I'm the onewhoa has to boil the water."
100,00:06:29.79,00:06:29.79,I'm the one who hasto go hunt food.
101,00:06:31.67,00:06:31.67,"Those girls don't do anything,especially Jennifer,"
102,00:06:33.46,00:06:33.46,Katie and Janu.Katie and Jennifer don't do
103,00:06:36.08,00:06:36.08,anything all day long.I've never seen them touch a
104,00:06:38.25,00:06:38.25,"piece of wood since we've beenhere, and now Janu is on her"
105,00:06:41.42,00:06:41.42,"eighth straight day of,""Boo-hoo! I want to go home."""

107,00:06:45.83,00:06:45.83,"You know, I'm too much of afeminist to watch this happen."
108,00:06:48.21,00:06:48.21,These Alpha males are justtotally waiting on them hand
109,00:06:50.21,00:06:50.21,"and foot, and the girlsare loving it."
110,00:06:52.00,00:06:52.00,They're eating it up.It's making me sick.
111,00:06:54.04,00:06:54.04,I want to takeall three of those girls
112,00:06:56.04,00:06:56.04,and push them in that fire.( sighs ): Oh...

120,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,and an overall openattitude toward life.
121,00:07:32.08,00:07:32.08,It is a food challenge.The food you're going
122,00:07:34.79,00:07:34.79,to be eating is a delicacy.It's also very nutritious.
123,00:07:38.25,00:07:38.25,"It's from this part of theworld, and it's called balute."
124,00:07:41.21,00:07:41.21,Balute is a fertilized eggthat contains
125,00:07:45.21,00:07:45.21,partially-formed duckling.These ducks

130,00:07:57.54,00:07:57.54,increase the numberof balute you eat.

132,00:08:01.88,00:08:01.88,"then two balute,then three balute"
133,00:08:04.62,00:08:04.62,and finally four balute.There will be four rounds.
134,00:08:06.75,00:08:06.75,"Each time you get it down, youscore a point for your tribe."
135,00:08:09.46,00:08:09.46,"At the end of four rounds,whoever has the most"
136,00:08:11.62,00:08:11.62,points wins reward.Makes sense?

277,00:15:19.04,00:15:19.04,to feeling human for one day.You think you should
278,00:15:21.79,00:15:21.79,use all that for showers?Given that we're all still
279,00:15:23.96,00:15:23.96,drinking poisoned water.>> We should use none of it
280,00:15:26.00,00:15:26.00,for showers.>> I agree.
281,00:15:27.88,00:15:27.88,>>> I think we shouldtake off that showerhead
282,00:15:29.75,00:15:29.75,and fill canteens right out ofthat spigot.
283,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,">> I think most people wanta shower, though."

285,00:15:36.12,00:15:36.12,is over there.>> Can we just have
286,00:15:37.92,00:15:37.92,"one shower, and then...>> We can, but we're still in"
287,00:15:40.17,00:15:40.17,a survival situation here.Jenn was crestfallen that she
288,00:15:42.79,00:15:42.79,"wasn't going to get in.I had to assert myself,"
289,00:15:45.96,00:15:45.96,and it's somethingI've been trying not to do.
290,00:15:48.04,00:15:48.04,But there were peoplewithin the tribe who
291,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,actually thought that the firstfresh water that we've seen
292,00:15:53.04,00:15:53.04,in 19 days should actuallybe used for shower purposes.
293,00:15:56.46,00:15:56.46,"It's ridiculous.>> What do you think, Jenn?"
294,00:16:00.25,00:16:00.25,">> Jenn wants a shower.>> Everybody takes a shower,"
295,00:16:02.50,00:16:02.50,we're down to two-thirds.I agree.

299,00:16:12.92,00:16:12.92,"I mean, come on.You can't let us use,"
300,00:16:15.54,00:16:15.54,"like, a gallon or two?>> I vote for not using the"
301,00:16:18.04,00:16:18.04,"fresh water, but like, I knowthere's some people who"

303,00:16:22.21,00:16:22.21,"that comfort, so...>> No, it's all right."
304,00:16:24.71,00:16:24.71,">> Nobody wants to speak up,and I'm not going"
305,00:16:27.25,00:16:27.25,to be that person.I could see that coming back
306,00:16:29.38,00:16:29.38,"to haunt me.""Oh, Jenn really wanted to use,"
307,00:16:32.17,00:16:32.17,"you know,the clean water for her bath."""
308,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,>> So we're okay?Everybody's good

310,00:16:38.00,00:16:38.00,">> Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.>> He really is not letting it"
311,00:16:41.08,00:16:41.08,"be a vote.Maybe, in the end, that'll"
312,00:16:44.12,00:16:44.12,"make him be voted off, you know,for being such a sourpuss"
313,00:16:47.12,00:16:47.12,about the whole thing.>> You see how much of that
314,00:17:03.04,00:17:03.04,stuff I had left in my hand?Okay?
315,00:17:06.00,00:17:06.00,">> Yeah, I know.It's always like that."
316,00:17:08.12,00:17:08.12,"It's, like, we're there, but wemiss it by, like, an inch."

319,00:17:17.21,00:17:17.21,"shoving it in there, but Tom,he shoved his in faster."
320,00:17:20.88,00:17:20.88,"Well, I'm getting tiredof losing to him, you know?"
321,00:17:23.33,00:17:23.33,">> Right.For some reason, you keep"
322,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,"matching up against him.Well, you're the strongest"
323,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,"on our tribe, and he'sthe strongest on theirs."
324,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,That's why.>> I feel like I can beat
325,00:17:31.17,00:17:31.17,anybody else on that tribe.>> I know.
326,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17,>> If you want toknow the truth.
327,00:17:34.88,00:17:34.88,>> I know you can.That's why you're not

332,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,>> Bobby Jon?I think he's been
333,00:17:54.75,00:17:54.75,"too positive about the losses.He's, like, ""It's okay."
334,00:17:57.83,00:17:57.83,"We lost again.We'll get them next time."""
335,00:17:59.96,00:17:59.96,But he's startingto get frustrated.
336,00:18:04.96,00:18:04.96,I don't know.I guess guys
337,00:18:07.21,00:18:07.21,"need to throw things,punch things, make noise--"
338,00:18:09.21,00:18:09.21,whatever they can to feel manlywhen they're pissed off.
339,00:18:11.46,00:18:11.46,"But, half the time,he scares me."

341,00:18:26.92,00:18:26.92,finally startingto take it to heart.
342,00:18:29.67,00:18:29.67,"So, I was actually happyto see him mad like that."

351,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,But I'm still worried aboutthem switching over and trying
352,00:19:21.12,00:19:21.12,to pick Tom and I off.They're two votes strong.
353,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,That makes it a threat.I think they're definitely
354,00:19:25.54,00:19:25.54,"using their relationshipfor strategic advantage, so we"
355,00:19:27.75,00:19:27.75,"know, going into it, you know,that we're going to need to take"
356,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,"one of them out eventually.We're all family, but there's"
357,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,"a business side to it, too,so we are on the verge"
358,00:19:36.38,00:19:36.38,"of utter ridiculousness,for sure, and I can't wait."
359,00:19:39.38,00:19:39.38,">> Well, listen, wegot good news."

365,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,"Katie and Ian and I hooked upon day two, and said let's see"
366,00:19:55.50,00:19:55.50,how far we can take this.And Stephenie also

566,00:32:49.58,00:32:49.58,"the jocks would make fun of me,I'd quit, I'd run off crying."
567,00:32:52.46,00:32:52.46,That was one of the reasonsI came here.
568,00:32:54.42,00:32:54.42,">> Good job, Coby.>> You know what?"

573,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,"I was always called the girlyguy, you know, I was the sissy."
574,00:33:08.12,00:33:08.12,"People would pick on me,and I would just give up."
575,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,I ended up quitting schoolbecause people made fun of me.
576,00:33:13.54,00:33:13.54,( voice breaking ): I've givenup a lot in my life.
577,00:33:22.12,00:33:22.12,"But I wasn't going to letanybody make me quit this time,"

585,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,">> You know,we've tried to prepare,"

594,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,and now it's gonna bebetween she and I.
595,00:34:32.54,00:34:32.54,I don't want to go home--I'm gonna feel like a failure
596,00:34:35.04,00:34:35.04,if I go home right now.You know how bad I'll feel?
597,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,">> That's what I said,that's what I said."

615,00:35:37.04,00:35:37.04,"that I can't do.So if I'm here by myself,"
616,00:35:39.38,00:35:39.38,that will be really scary.>> It's gonna be weird.
617,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,>> I know.( laughs )
