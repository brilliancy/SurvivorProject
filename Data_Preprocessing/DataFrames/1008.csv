1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,Survivor: Tom brought in the big one.
3,00:00:05.46,00:00:05.46,( laughing ) >> How did you get it?
4,00:00:07.62,00:00:07.62,">> I hit it with the machete. >> Oh, now, who's"
5,00:00:10.00,00:00:10.00,the great white shark killer? >> And wham!
6,00:00:12.00,00:00:12.00,>> It's gonna be a lot harder to vote him off now.
7,00:00:13.88,00:00:13.88,>> Yeah! ( Tom whoops )
8,00:00:15.62,00:00:15.62,">> PROBST: When tree mail arrived, the tribes learned"
9,00:00:18.83,00:00:18.83,they were to build an SOS signal that could be seen from the air.
10,00:00:21.75,00:00:21.75,>> Little rain... >> I say we burn
11,00:00:23.17,00:00:23.17,our friggin' shelter. >> PROBST: Ulong jumped right
12,00:00:26.17,00:00:26.17,"in, while Koror took a more methodical approach."
13,00:00:28.33,00:00:28.33,>> The first thing that we want to do is find the right
14,00:00:30.96,00:00:30.96,location. >> PROBST: When the plane flew
15,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,"over Ulong, the drop master was not impressed."
16,00:00:35.42,00:00:35.42,">> Unless you're flying right over the top,"
17,00:00:37.79,00:00:37.79,it would be hard to see. >> PROBST: And although Koror
18,00:00:40.67,00:00:40.67,had trouble with their fire... Do you have enough information
19,00:00:42.79,00:00:42.79,"to make a decision? >> Yes, I do."
20,00:00:44.67,00:00:44.67,>> PROBST: ...it was their signal that best caught the eye
21,00:00:47.08,00:00:47.08,of the drop master. ( cheering )
22,00:00:50.17,00:00:50.17,>> I'm so happy! >> In the box was three
23,00:00:55.25,00:00:55.25,bottles of red wine... >> Cheese tortellini
24,00:00:57.54,00:00:57.54,and tomato sauce. >> And then we had all of these
25,00:01:01.12,00:01:01.12,military food packages that you could heat up
26,00:01:03.38,00:01:03.38,and eat as meals. >> To a great tribe.
27,00:01:06.12,00:01:06.12,">> PROBST: At Ulong, the tribe took the loss hard."
28,00:01:08.62,00:01:08.62,>> We lost the reward challenge because they worked harder.
29,00:01:11.17,00:01:11.17,"Or I'm sure they worked smarter, knowing them."
30,00:01:13.42,00:01:13.42,">> PROBST: At Koror, Jenn and Gregg's budding romance"
31,00:01:16.62,00:01:16.62,raised some red flags. >> I'm concerned
32,00:01:18.79,00:01:18.79,with Gregg and Jenn. It just could be a monkey wrench
33,00:01:21.12,00:01:21.12,that we don't see coming. >> PROBST: At the immunity
34,00:01:24.42,00:01:24.42,"challenge, Ulong couldn't get it together."
35,00:01:27.38,00:01:27.38,Ulong may be worse off than when you started.
36,00:01:29.29,00:01:29.29,>> Back. >> PROBST: And Coby moved his
37,00:01:31.71,00:01:31.71,"tribe to another Koror victory. >> Left-- empty spot,"
38,00:01:33.29,00:01:33.29,"and I swear we got it. >> PROBST: And with that,"
39,00:01:35.67,00:01:35.67,Koror wins immunity for the sixth straight time.
40,00:01:39.04,00:01:39.04,"Before Tribal Council, Stephenie feared the worst"
41,00:01:41.75,00:01:41.75,when Bobby Jon couldn't commit. >> I thought we were sticking
42,00:01:44.21,00:01:44.21,"together, no matter what. >> Well, it's just kind"
43,00:01:46.21,00:01:46.21,"of a toss up, you know? >> You're not sticking"
44,00:01:48.12,00:01:48.12,"with your word, then? >> I don't really want"
45,00:01:50.21,00:01:50.21,to talk about it. >> I can tell by the way he's
46,00:01:52.75,00:01:52.75,acting he's gonna vote for me. >> PROBST: But the votes came
47,00:01:55.33,00:01:55.33,"in, and Ibrehem was voted out, when Bobby Jon honored his"
48,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,arrangement with Stephenie to be the last
49,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,two members of Ulong. Ten are left.
50,00:02:06.25,00:02:06.25,Who will be voted out tonight? ( blowing )
51,00:03:40.83,00:03:40.83,>> There it goes. >> I thank you
52,00:03:44.04,00:03:44.04,for keeping your word. >> Yeah?
53,00:03:46.12,00:03:46.12,>> I was a little nervous. I-I knew it was
54,00:03:48.25,00:03:48.25,a hard decision for you. >> It's over. It's done.
55,00:03:52.04,00:03:52.04,"There wasn't no good way to do it, you know?"
56,00:03:54.21,00:03:54.21,>> I know. Tonight we went to Tribal
57,00:03:56.58,00:03:56.58,"Council, and I was really nervous."
58,00:03:59.50,00:03:59.50,I really thought I was gonna be the one to go.
59,00:04:02.12,00:04:02.12,"Bobby Jon, he beat around the bush."
60,00:04:03.79,00:04:03.79,He didn't really want to give me an answer on
61,00:04:06.08,00:04:06.08,"whether he was going to vote for me or Ibrehem,"
62,00:04:08.25,00:04:08.25,but luckily he kept his word and Ibrehem went home.
63,00:04:16.12,00:04:16.12,">> Ibrehem and I, we had a friendship, we had a bond, but"
64,00:04:20.12,00:04:20.12,"in competition you have to rule out feelings, and"
65,00:04:23.25,00:04:23.25,I just thought Stephenie has performed
66,00:04:25.08,00:04:25.08,"better than Ibrehem at challenges, so... I did what"
67,00:04:27.88,00:04:27.88,was best for the tribe. >> I'm glad that we're still
68,00:04:30.12,00:04:30.12,here. I'm still ready
69,00:04:32.12,00:04:32.12,to bring home a victory. I think we can do it.
70,00:04:34.58,00:04:34.58,">> Yeah, I do, too. >> It was tough with three, "
71,00:04:38.25,00:04:38.25,"and it's already weird being here only with two, but"
72,00:04:40.50,00:04:40.50,I don't feel that my time is up here.
73,00:04:42.92,00:04:42.92,"I'm still ready to win, and it's clear now"
74,00:04:45.88,00:04:45.88,that Bobby Jon and I are the two people
75,00:04:47.96,00:04:47.96,best for the job right now. ( buzzing )
76,00:05:21.46,00:05:21.46,>> Eww! Go! Get out of here!
77,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,>> What's with the rats today? There's like six of them playing
78,00:05:28.08,00:05:28.08,in front of the steps. >> They're looking for...
79,00:05:31.17,00:05:31.17,>> Yeah. >> Just took them a few days
80,00:05:33.67,00:05:33.67,"to lose their fear. The rats, they're"
81,00:05:36.17,00:05:36.17,"going crazy today. I don't know if, uh, if we've"
82,00:05:39.04,00:05:39.04,gotten sloppy with food or we're cutting the coconuts
83,00:05:41.46,00:05:41.46,too close to the camp or... I just think it's that the rats
84,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,have got comfortable with us and realize that we're not
85,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,a threat to them. >> The rats have become
86,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,"bolder and bolder, and it's all our tribe's fault because nobody"
87,00:05:56.58,00:05:56.58,"will listen to me. There's coconut everywhere,"
88,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,so of course the rats are going to become more and more bold.
89,00:06:00.96,00:06:00.96,"They're eating our coconut, which is all over the camp"
90,00:06:03.21,00:06:03.21,because people won't clean up. So every bit of rat that we get
91,00:06:05.75,00:06:05.75,all over us is deserved. >> You are?
92,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,">> Uh, I'm not smelling it anymore."
93,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83,I've told people for days. I have told Tom every day
94,00:06:15.21,00:06:15.21,"since he caught that shark to move his damn shark head,"
95,00:06:17.29,00:06:17.29,"because it stinks, there's flies everywhere."
96,00:06:19.17,00:06:19.17,It's not even 20 feet from our camp.
97,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"So I got up this morning, I moved the shark head,"
98,00:06:23.21,00:06:23.21,"I moved the guts because nobody was doing anything, as usual."
99,00:06:25.29,00:06:25.29,"I'm the one who has to get the firewood, I'm the one who has to"
100,00:06:27.54,00:06:27.54,"keep the fire going, I'm the one whoa has to boil the water."
101,00:06:29.79,00:06:29.79,I'm the one who has to go hunt food.
102,00:06:31.67,00:06:31.67,"Those girls don't do anything, especially Jennifer,"
103,00:06:33.46,00:06:33.46,Katie and Janu. Katie and Jennifer don't do
104,00:06:36.08,00:06:36.08,anything all day long. I've never seen them touch a
105,00:06:38.25,00:06:38.25,"piece of wood since we've been here, and now Janu is on her"
106,00:06:41.42,00:06:41.42,"eighth straight day of, ""Boo-hoo! I want to go home."""
107,00:06:43.96,00:06:43.96,Would you quit already? Get out of the game.
108,00:06:45.83,00:06:45.83,"You know, I'm too much of a feminist to watch this happen."
109,00:06:48.21,00:06:48.21,These Alpha males are just totally waiting on them hand
110,00:06:50.21,00:06:50.21,"and foot, and the girls are loving it."
111,00:06:52.00,00:06:52.00,They're eating it up. It's making me sick.
112,00:06:54.04,00:06:54.04,I want to take all three of those girls
113,00:06:56.04,00:06:56.04,and push them in that fire. ( sighs ): Oh...
114,00:07:02.04,00:07:02.04,">> Come on in, Koror. We'll now bring in Ulong."
115,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,Ibrehem voted out at the last Tribal Council.
116,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,">> Hi. >> PROBST: You're only two,"
117,00:07:18.00,00:07:18.00,but you're still a tribe. >> Yep.
118,00:07:20.25,00:07:20.25,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get to today's challenge."
119,00:07:23.54,00:07:23.54,"It is going to require an adventurous spirit,"
120,00:07:27.12,00:07:27.12,a willingness to try something new
121,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,and an overall open attitude toward life.
122,00:07:32.08,00:07:32.08,It is a food challenge. The food you're going
123,00:07:34.79,00:07:34.79,to be eating is a delicacy. It's also very nutritious.
124,00:07:38.25,00:07:38.25,"It's from this part of the world, and it's called balute."
125,00:07:41.21,00:07:41.21,Balute is a fertilized egg that contains
126,00:07:45.21,00:07:45.21,partially-formed duckling. These ducks
127,00:07:47.04,00:07:47.04,"are about 20 days old. >> Oh, my gosh."
128,00:07:49.79,00:07:49.79,>> PROBST: You can see the beak... and it is full of
129,00:07:52.42,00:07:52.42,protein. Here's how it'll work.
130,00:07:54.88,00:07:54.88,"We're gonna go in rounds. Each round, we will"
131,00:07:57.54,00:07:57.54,increase the number of balute you eat.
132,00:07:59.67,00:07:59.67,"In the first round you'll eat one balute,"
133,00:08:01.88,00:08:01.88,"then two balute, then three balute"
134,00:08:04.62,00:08:04.62,and finally four balute. There will be four rounds.
135,00:08:06.75,00:08:06.75,"Each time you get it down, you score a point for your tribe."
136,00:08:09.46,00:08:09.46,"At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most"
137,00:08:11.62,00:08:11.62,points wins reward. Makes sense?
138,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,>> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: Want to know what
139,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,you're playing for? >> Yeah.
140,00:08:16.79,00:08:16.79,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: I know you both have
141,00:08:18.96,00:08:18.96,showers. What you don't have for
142,00:08:21.00,00:08:21.00,"those showers is fresh water. First part of your reward,"
143,00:08:23.54,00:08:23.54,55 gallons of fresh water in a tank with a showerhead
144,00:08:27.12,00:08:27.12,delivered to your camp. That's water
145,00:08:29.50,00:08:29.50,"you don't have to find, water you don't have"
146,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,"to bring back, water you don't have to boil."
147,00:08:33.38,00:08:33.38,"To go along with that, because, trust me,"
148,00:08:35.62,00:08:35.62,you guys reek... ( laughing )
149,00:08:38.17,00:08:38.17,...a little luxury gift bag here.
150,00:08:40.12,00:08:40.12,>> Wow. ( cheering )
151,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,"Everything you need to get clean, get that taste"
152,00:08:45.21,00:08:45.21,"out of your mouth, get that smell off your body."
153,00:08:48.12,00:08:48.12,Do not underestimate how revitalizing that can be
154,00:08:51.21,00:08:51.21,to get clean again. That's what you're playing for.
155,00:08:53.62,00:08:53.62,"Koror, because you have six extra members now,"
156,00:08:56.83,00:08:56.83,you're sitting six people out. Just tell me the two
157,00:08:59.21,00:08:59.21,that are going to compete. Ian... and Tom.
158,00:09:03.17,00:09:03.17,It'll be Ian and Tom versus Steph and Bobby Jon.
159,00:09:06.04,00:09:06.04,"Everybody else, take a spot on the bench."
160,00:09:10.67,00:09:10.67,"Round one, come on up. This is not a race."
161,00:09:14.62,00:09:14.62,This is just get it down. Here's how you know
162,00:09:17.17,00:09:17.17,when you're finished. Show me an empty mouth.
163,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,"I'll say you're good. Once I say you're good, if it"
164,00:09:22.08,00:09:22.08,"comes back up, it's fine. Balute is served."
165,00:09:24.96,00:09:24.96,>> Oh. >> PROBST: Survivors ready?
166,00:09:28.12,00:09:28.12,>> Ready. >> Ready.
167,00:09:30.33,00:09:30.33,">> PROBST: Eat. >> How's it, Tom?"
168,00:09:34.58,00:09:34.58,">> PROBST: Bites right in. >> Come on, Tom, it's beer."
169,00:09:37.12,00:09:37.12,>> PROBST: So does Steph. >> Down.
170,00:09:42.71,00:09:42.71,>> PROBST: Tom's clean. He's good.
171,00:09:43.96,00:09:43.96,">> Give me a wink, Tom. Come on, show me something."
172,00:09:46.25,00:09:46.25,All right. >> PROBST: That's good.
173,00:09:48.79,00:09:48.79,Koror and Ulong both score. We're tied one-one
174,00:09:51.08,00:09:51.08,after the first round. >> Watch the beak.
175,00:09:53.79,00:09:53.79,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Next two, come on up."
176,00:09:56.75,00:09:56.75,">> ""Watch the beak."" >> PROBST: Survivors ready?"
177,00:09:59.21,00:09:59.21,Eat. >> Mmm!
178,00:10:07.25,00:10:07.25,That was a juicy one. >> Echh.
179,00:10:09.54,00:10:09.54,( Ian chuckles ) >> Oh... Umm...
180,00:10:13.25,00:10:13.25,"What's going through your head, Ian?"
181,00:10:15.00,00:10:15.00,>> There was some egg shell in that one.
182,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00,>> PROBST: Sure that was what was the crunchy part?
183,00:10:18.88,00:10:18.88,>> I don't know. >> I don't either.
184,00:10:20.62,00:10:20.62,">> But I need the soap. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon, we got a"
185,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,little piece right there on the plate.
186,00:10:25.58,00:10:25.58,Let me see that thing. That'll work.
187,00:10:29.54,00:10:29.54,"All right. That'll work. >> All right, Ian."
188,00:10:32.42,00:10:32.42,">> Good job, Ian. >> PROBST: We're good after two"
189,00:10:34.17,00:10:34.17,"rounds. Tom and Steph,"
190,00:10:36.12,00:10:36.12,we are tied at two-two. You now have three balute
191,00:10:38.79,00:10:38.79,to get down. Survivors ready... and eat.
192,00:10:47.17,00:10:47.17,">> PROBST: Thinking at all about what you're eating, Steph?"
193,00:10:49.79,00:10:49.79,>> Eggs. >> PROBST: Eggs.
194,00:10:51.46,00:10:51.46,It's just eggs. >> Just don't look at it.
195,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50,>> I got a chirp out of that one.
196,00:10:55.79,00:10:55.79,>> Mmm. Mmm. >> PROBST: Tom has three down.
197,00:10:59.46,00:10:59.46,He's clearing that mouth. That's good.
198,00:11:02.08,00:11:02.08,">> Damn, Tom. >> Hungry."
199,00:11:05.12,00:11:05.12,">> I can feel the feet a little, too-- they scratch."
200,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,>> PROBST: That looks good. Tom and Steph--
201,00:11:11.92,00:11:11.92,"they've downed three balute. We are tied three-three,"
202,00:11:14.21,00:11:14.21,"moving into the last round. Ian, Bobby Jon,"
203,00:11:18.00,00:11:18.00,four balute waiting for you. Survivors ready...
204,00:11:21.00,00:11:21.00,"eat. >> Come on, Ian."
205,00:11:24.21,00:11:24.21,">> Good job, I. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon not messing"
206,00:11:26.12,00:11:26.12,around. He's almost done.
207,00:11:28.04,00:11:28.04,">> Come on, I. >> Come on, I. Just keep..."
208,00:11:30.29,00:11:30.29,">> It's all right, I. Get it down."
209,00:11:32.75,00:11:32.75,">> PROBST: Open that mouth, brother."
210,00:11:35.00,00:11:35.00,That's good. Ian gets down all four
211,00:11:41.08,00:11:41.08,just like that. Head back.
212,00:11:43.25,00:11:43.25,"We are tied four-four. >> PROBST: Okay, moving into"
213,00:11:45.50,00:11:45.50,a tiebreaker. You'll pick
214,00:11:47.96,00:11:47.96,your strongest person. You'll eat five balute.
215,00:11:49.96,00:11:49.96,It's a time trial. First one to get five down
216,00:11:52.67,00:11:52.67,wins reward. >> I was hoping
217,00:11:54.67,00:11:54.67,for a few more of these. >> PROBST: Who's it going to be
218,00:11:57.17,00:11:57.17,for Koror? >> It's going to be Tom.
219,00:11:59.12,00:11:59.12,>> PROBST: Tom's going to take the five.
220,00:12:01.08,00:12:01.08,>> Got it. >> PROBST: And Bobby Jon.
221,00:12:03.12,00:12:03.12,"Come on up. >> Come on, Tom."
222,00:12:05.25,00:12:05.25,">> Attaboy, Tom. Come on. >> PROBST: At stake:"
223,00:12:07.50,00:12:07.50,55 gallons of fresh water. That is a lot of water.
224,00:12:11.08,00:12:11.08,Plus everything you need to get clean-- get this taste
225,00:12:13.92,00:12:13.92,"out of your mouth. First one to get all five down,"
226,00:12:16.67,00:12:16.67,"show me an empty mouth, wins reward."
227,00:12:19.08,00:12:19.08,Survivors ready... eat.
228,00:12:24.42,00:12:24.42,Bobby Jon two-fisting it. >> Good job. Good job.
229,00:12:27.62,00:12:27.62,">> PROBST: Tom trying, taking nibbles from both."
230,00:12:30.08,00:12:30.08,">> Come on, now. >> PROBST: Gonna come down"
231,00:12:32.38,00:12:32.38,"to an empty mouth. >> Guiness, Guiness."
232,00:12:34.29,00:12:34.29,>> PROBST: Bobby Jon shoving that fifth one in there.
233,00:12:36.46,00:12:36.46,">> Get it down, Tom! >> PROBST: Keep it in there."
234,00:12:40.71,00:12:40.71,"Keep it over the plate. >> You can do it, Tom."
235,00:12:43.29,00:12:43.29,"Mind over matter, fireman. >> You got it, Tom."
236,00:12:45.29,00:12:45.29,">> Nice job. Nice job. Nice job, Tom."
237,00:12:47.17,00:12:47.17,">> Come on, Tom. You got it, Tom."

240,00:12:52.88,00:12:52.88,">> Nice work, Tom. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon trying"
241,00:12:55.04,00:12:55.04,"to shove it down. >> Come on, Tom. Koror!"
242,00:12:57.12,00:12:57.12,"You got it, Tom. ( clapping )"
243,00:13:01.67,00:13:01.67,">> Think about how dirty I am now, come on."
244,00:13:04.25,00:13:04.25,">> You can do it, Tom. Show him that mouth."
245,00:13:08.12,00:13:08.12,">> Come on, Tom. >> Just swallow, Tom."
246,00:13:10.21,00:13:10.21,"Hurry, before him. >> Bobby Jon's getting it."
247,00:13:12.38,00:13:12.38,>> Hurry! >> Swallow. Swallow.
248,00:13:14.92,00:13:14.92,"Swallow it, Bobby Jon. >> He's almost there. Come on."
249,00:13:17.75,00:13:17.75,>> PROBST: Tom very close. ( Bobby Jon retching )
250,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,Tom's got it for Koror! ( groans )
251,00:13:24.04,00:13:24.04,( cheering ) Might as well finish it.
252,00:13:37.96,00:13:37.96,"Right, Bobby Jon? >> Good job."
253,00:13:41.17,00:13:41.17,>> PROBST: Tom? Rinse that out of your mouth.
254,00:13:44.25,00:13:44.25,"A little Scope will make that taste go away, huh?"
255,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,">> Hook a brother up, will you?"
256,00:13:52.21,00:13:52.21,>> This tastes good enough to drink.
257,00:13:53.46,00:13:53.46,>> PROBST: This challenge is over for Ulong.
258,00:13:55.42,00:13:55.42,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp, guys."
259,00:14:01.17,00:14:01.17,">> Man, I almost had him. >> PROBST: Koror, 55 gallons of"
260,00:14:05.04,00:14:05.04,"fresh water in a tank, with a showerhead, will be delivered to"
261,00:14:08.71,00:14:08.71,your camp. You can take this back with you.
262,00:14:12.04,00:14:12.04,Congratulations. >> That's the soap.
263,00:14:14.79,00:14:14.79,I'm getting the dirt off! ( cheering )
264,00:14:18.46,00:14:18.46,>> All right! >> Whoo!
265,00:14:44.25,00:14:44.25,>> The challenge today was for a reward.
266,00:14:48.21,00:14:48.21,"We got 55 gallons of water, which is great,"
267,00:14:50.33,00:14:50.33,and we won a basket of shampoo and conditioner and toothpaste
268,00:14:55.17,00:14:55.17,and toothbrushes. >> Cheers.
269,00:14:57.29,00:14:57.29,>> I'd say I'm a big fan of the Scope mouthwash.
270,00:14:59.62,00:14:59.62,I particularly like the Citrus Splash.
271,00:15:01.21,00:15:01.21,Tastes a little bit like oranges.
272,00:15:03.25,00:15:03.25,"( chuckling ) >> We all took a swig,"
273,00:15:05.42,00:15:05.42,and just... it felt so good 'cause it was just tingling.
274,00:15:09.08,00:15:09.08,It was wonderful. >> Did y'all want to come see
275,00:15:11.29,00:15:11.29,what you won back here? New water thing.
276,00:15:13.29,00:15:13.29,>> Seeing the big drum up there...
277,00:15:15.46,00:15:15.46,Oh! We have a shower. I was looking forward
278,00:15:19.04,00:15:19.04,to feeling human for one day. You think you should
279,00:15:21.79,00:15:21.79,use all that for showers? Given that we're all still
280,00:15:23.96,00:15:23.96,drinking poisoned water. >> We should use none of it
281,00:15:26.00,00:15:26.00,for showers. >> I agree.
282,00:15:27.88,00:15:27.88,>>> I think we should take off that showerhead
283,00:15:29.75,00:15:29.75,and fill canteens right out of that spigot.
284,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,">> I think most people want a shower, though."
285,00:15:33.92,00:15:33.92,Don't you? >> Let's see how much
286,00:15:36.12,00:15:36.12,is over there. >> Can we just have
287,00:15:37.92,00:15:37.92,"one shower, and then... >> We can, but we're still in"
288,00:15:40.17,00:15:40.17,a survival situation here. Jenn was crestfallen that she
289,00:15:42.79,00:15:42.79,"wasn't going to get in. I had to assert myself,"
290,00:15:45.96,00:15:45.96,and it's something I've been trying not to do.
291,00:15:48.04,00:15:48.04,But there were people within the tribe who
292,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,actually thought that the first fresh water that we've seen
293,00:15:53.04,00:15:53.04,in 19 days should actually be used for shower purposes.
294,00:15:56.46,00:15:56.46,"It's ridiculous. >> What do you think, Jenn?"
295,00:16:00.25,00:16:00.25,">> Jenn wants a shower. >> Everybody takes a shower,"
296,00:16:02.50,00:16:02.50,we're down to two-thirds. I agree.
297,00:16:04.79,00:16:04.79,">> Tom is the one who spoke up. ""Well, I think we need"
298,00:16:07.96,00:16:07.96,"to, uh, conserve, you know, and use that water"
299,00:16:10.21,00:16:10.21,"for drinking."" And it's 55 gallons of water!"
300,00:16:12.92,00:16:12.92,"I mean, come on. You can't let us use,"
301,00:16:15.54,00:16:15.54,"like, a gallon or two? >> I vote for not using the"
302,00:16:18.04,00:16:18.04,"fresh water, but like, I know there's some people who"
303,00:16:20.25,00:16:20.25,really want a shower and really want
304,00:16:22.21,00:16:22.21,"that comfort, so... >> No, it's all right."
305,00:16:24.71,00:16:24.71,">> Nobody wants to speak up, and I'm not going"
306,00:16:27.25,00:16:27.25,to be that person. I could see that coming back
307,00:16:29.38,00:16:29.38,"to haunt me. ""Oh, Jenn really wanted to use,"
308,00:16:32.17,00:16:32.17,"you know, the clean water for her bath."""
309,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,>> So we're okay? Everybody's good
310,00:16:36.21,00:16:36.21,"with the decision? >> Everyone's good, or...?"
311,00:16:38.00,00:16:38.00,">> Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. >> He really is not letting it"
312,00:16:41.08,00:16:41.08,"be a vote. Maybe, in the end, that'll"
313,00:16:44.12,00:16:44.12,"make him be voted off, you know, for being such a sourpuss"
314,00:16:47.12,00:16:47.12,about the whole thing. >> You see how much of that
315,00:17:03.04,00:17:03.04,stuff I had left in my hand? Okay?
316,00:17:06.00,00:17:06.00,">> Yeah, I know. It's always like that."
317,00:17:08.12,00:17:08.12,"It's, like, we're there, but we miss it by, like, an inch."
318,00:17:12.54,00:17:12.54,>> Today's defeat is heartbreaking.
319,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,"I mean, I had my throat open as much as I could,"
320,00:17:17.21,00:17:17.21,"shoving it in there, but Tom, he shoved his in faster."
321,00:17:20.88,00:17:20.88,"Well, I'm getting tired of losing to him, you know?"
322,00:17:23.33,00:17:23.33,">> Right. For some reason, you keep"
323,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,"matching up against him. Well, you're the strongest"
324,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,"on our tribe, and he's the strongest on theirs."
325,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,That's why. >> I feel like I can beat
326,00:17:31.17,00:17:31.17,anybody else on that tribe. >> I know.
327,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17,>> If you want to know the truth.
328,00:17:34.88,00:17:34.88,>> I know you can. That's why you're not
329,00:17:36.83,00:17:36.83,going up against anybody else. You're going up against him.
330,00:17:39.08,00:17:39.08,">> It just seems like Tom beats me every single time, and"
331,00:17:41.04,00:17:41.04,"that's something that's getting real, real old,"
332,00:17:44.12,00:17:44.12,"so I'm real pissed right now. I mean, I see fire."
333,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,>> Bobby Jon? I think he's been
334,00:17:54.75,00:17:54.75,"too positive about the losses. He's, like, ""It's okay."
335,00:17:57.83,00:17:57.83,"We lost again. We'll get them next time."""
336,00:17:59.96,00:17:59.96,But he's starting to get frustrated.
337,00:18:04.96,00:18:04.96,I don't know. I guess guys
338,00:18:07.21,00:18:07.21,"need to throw things, punch things, make noise--"
339,00:18:09.21,00:18:09.21,whatever they can to feel manly when they're pissed off.
340,00:18:11.46,00:18:11.46,"But, half the time, he scares me."
341,00:18:24.25,00:18:24.25,"Bobby Jon is sick of losing, and I think he's finally,"
342,00:18:26.92,00:18:26.92,finally starting to take it to heart.
343,00:18:29.67,00:18:29.67,"So, I was actually happy to see him mad like that."
344,00:18:49.29,00:18:49.29,">> Being undefeated is glorious, but it's a lot of days"
345,00:18:53.21,00:18:53.21,of monotony. We've been with the same people
346,00:18:55.62,00:18:55.62,"for many days now, but things are going to change real"
347,00:18:59.04,00:18:59.04,quick around here. No more Happy Koror Day.
348,00:19:01.58,00:19:01.58,No more... ( cheering ) It's going to be...
349,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,( growls )... eating each other.
350,00:19:14.46,00:19:14.46,">> If they turn, then they need to be broken up."
351,00:19:16.92,00:19:16.92,Gregg and Jenn-- they're part of the alliance.
352,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,But I'm still worried about them switching over and trying
353,00:19:21.12,00:19:21.12,to pick Tom and I off. They're two votes strong.
354,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,That makes it a threat. I think they're definitely
355,00:19:25.54,00:19:25.54,"using their relationship for strategic advantage, so we"
356,00:19:27.75,00:19:27.75,"know, going into it, you know, that we're going to need to take"
357,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,"one of them out eventually. We're all family, but there's"
358,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,"a business side to it, too, so we are on the verge"
359,00:19:36.38,00:19:36.38,"of utter ridiculousness, for sure, and I can't wait."
360,00:19:39.38,00:19:39.38,">> Well, listen, we got good news."
361,00:19:41.54,00:19:41.54,Stephenie's still there... >> We really need...
362,00:19:43.50,00:19:43.50,we're gonna need... >> We needed that.
363,00:19:45.25,00:19:45.25,We have to keep that quiet here. You can't slip in front
364,00:19:47.71,00:19:47.71,"of Gregg, you know, and Jenn, 'cause just... 'cause we"
365,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,are all together. You got to keep that quiet.
366,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,"Katie and Ian and I hooked up on day two, and said let's see"
367,00:19:55.50,00:19:55.50,how far we can take this. And Stephenie also
368,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,"was part of that group. Except for myself,"
369,00:20:00.96,00:20:00.96,"Ian and Katie, nobody even knows that there is"
370,00:20:03.46,00:20:03.46,a relationship that Stephenie would be the wolf
371,00:20:07.54,00:20:07.54,in the sheep's clothing that they wouldn't
372,00:20:09.92,00:20:09.92,"even see coming. >> Final four is me,"
373,00:20:11.88,00:20:11.88,"you, Stephenie and-and Katie. >> Right."
374,00:20:32.21,00:20:32.21,( grunts ) >> You all right?
375,00:20:33.96,00:20:33.96,>> Yeah. I just make noises. I feel like if I scream
376,00:20:36.12,00:20:36.12,"at it that, uh... >> My boyfriend does that,"
377,00:20:38.17,00:20:38.17,and I want to friggin' kill him. >> Really?
378,00:20:40.12,00:20:40.12,>> It's hard being here with just Bobby Jon.
379,00:20:42.38,00:20:42.38,"Sometimes I don't know what to say to him, you know?"
380,00:20:45.33,00:20:45.33,It's just the two of us left. We don't have a lot in common.
381,00:20:48.62,00:20:48.62,It's just tough. ( Bobby Jon burps )
382,00:20:50.96,00:20:50.96,Bobby Jon is totally turning into a caveman.
383,00:20:53.42,00:20:53.42,"( blowing gourd ) I mean, I'm not going to lie."
384,00:20:58.04,00:20:58.04,"Like, I am disgusting, but I scrub so much"
385,00:21:00.75,00:21:00.75,"with that sand-- my armpits, and my whole body--"
386,00:21:03.46,00:21:03.46,that I really don't think I smell that bad.
387,00:21:05.88,00:21:05.88,But Bobby Jon? He's just gross.
388,00:21:07.25,00:21:07.25,He is always dirty. Always.
389,00:21:10.21,00:21:10.21,( crunching ) And then he eats everything
390,00:21:12.88,00:21:12.88,"and anything. Like, today, we caught a crab."
391,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,"And he's eating the whole thing, and I'm, like, you know,"
392,00:21:18.58,00:21:18.58,you're supposed to eat the white meat inside.
393,00:21:20.38,00:21:20.38,"Not the shell. Oh, man..."
394,00:21:22.62,00:21:22.62,>> I know that's gross. >> Snot rocket.

396,00:21:29.71,00:21:29.71,around and see him blowing a snot rocket
397,00:21:31.75,00:21:31.75,straight out directly in the middle of where we sleep.
398,00:21:34.96,00:21:34.96,"He does apologize, but, um... it's nasty."
399,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,"It's hard, 'cause I-I think about Koror all the time,"
400,00:21:44.04,00:21:44.04,"and I know that they are just, like, living the life"
401,00:21:46.83,00:21:46.83,over there. They're having
402,00:21:49.00,00:21:49.00,"the time of their life, and here me and Bobby Jon are,"
403,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,"you know, busting our butts to try to keep the fire"
404,00:21:55.08,00:21:55.08,in the cave going. I thought this was going
405,00:21:57.50,00:21:57.50,to be a piece of cake. I could do this.
406,00:22:00.29,00:22:00.29,It's totally me. I'm totally cut out for this.
407,00:22:02.96,00:22:02.96,And I am. And I still believe that.
408,00:22:05.21,00:22:05.21,But it's tough. Damn!
409,00:22:13.00,00:22:13.00,>> Got to let it down. >> Holy crap!
410,00:22:15.88,00:22:15.88,"Oh, man, need help? ( grunts )"

418,00:22:48.46,00:22:48.46,"It's hard, it's like we're halfway through,"
419,00:22:50.83,00:22:50.83,but we have so long to go. ( voice breaking ): And...
420,00:22:56.00,00:22:56.00,"I'm trying to be so strong and it's like,"
421,00:22:57.83,00:22:57.83,"you can only do so much work. And it's hard, it's like,"
422,00:23:01.04,00:23:01.04,you're out here with no one. And it is really hard.
423,00:23:07.17,00:23:07.17,"I won't give up hope, but I feel like we're at,"
424,00:23:11.21,00:23:11.21,"like, a dead end. >> We are really"
425,00:23:26.46,00:23:26.46,kind of down right now 'cause we're really tired
426,00:23:28.67,00:23:28.67,"and we're really hungry, but we're just going to keep"
427,00:23:31.21,00:23:31.21,"trying and trying. You know, we don't give up,"
428,00:23:34.04,00:23:34.04,and I-I value that. >> I got one. I got one!
429,00:23:43.25,00:23:43.25,>> Wow! Good job!

432,00:23:51.38,00:23:51.38,"So I kind of felt like, you know,"
433,00:23:54.04,00:23:54.04,"like I'd accomplished something. Golly, the meat!"
434,00:23:57.92,00:23:57.92,( whistles ) >> That's going to be

437,00:24:09.79,00:24:09.79,This is so good. There's so much meat.
438,00:24:11.83,00:24:11.83,"The fish that we had, it was like the best thing I ever had"
439,00:24:14.79,00:24:14.79,in my life. You can feel the protein going
440,00:24:17.21,00:24:17.21,into your body. >> This is the breakfast
441,00:24:18.96,00:24:18.96,of champions. >> We are having a feast.

443,00:24:24.04,00:24:24.04,so it was a really nice treat to have that.
444,00:24:26.42,00:24:26.42,And that's all we needed to really get our spirits up.

567,00:32:49.58,00:32:49.58,"the jocks would make fun of me, I'd quit, I'd run off crying."
568,00:32:52.46,00:32:52.46,That was one of the reasons I came here.
569,00:32:54.42,00:32:54.42,">> Good job, Coby. >> You know what?"
570,00:32:56.21,00:32:56.21,"Every time we've done a physical challenge,"
571,00:32:58.00,00:32:58.00,"you've stepped up, man. Like, you've been very physical."
572,00:32:59.96,00:32:59.96,>> Don't make me cry. I never got to be part of a
573,00:33:02.46,00:33:02.46,"team,much less a winning team. As a kid I never played sports."
574,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,"I was always called the girly guy, you know, I was the sissy."
575,00:33:08.12,00:33:08.12,"People would pick on me, and I would just give up."
576,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,I ended up quitting school because people made fun of me.
577,00:33:13.54,00:33:13.54,( voice breaking ): I've given up a lot in my life.
578,00:33:22.12,00:33:22.12,"But I wasn't going to let anybody make me quit this time,"
579,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,"no matter how hard it is. So nobody was gonna, nobody was"
580,00:33:27.67,00:33:27.67,"gonna take this away from me, and that's why"
581,00:33:29.88,00:33:29.88,I've worked so hard. 'Cause I'm not quitting.
582,00:33:48.83,00:33:48.83,">> Well, we didn't get immunity. The final challenge."
583,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,Today we lost our last shot at immunity.
584,00:33:59.21,00:33:59.21,We had a great lead. We just suck at puzzles.
585,00:34:02.21,00:34:02.21,"And it's, like, what can we do? It's over now."
586,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,">> You know, we've tried to prepare,"
587,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,"we've tried to strategize, we've tried this, tried..."
588,00:34:13.54,00:34:13.54,"nothing has worked for this tribe-- I mean, nothing."
589,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,"In a way I feel like, you know, I lost the thing today, you"
590,00:34:19.12,00:34:19.12,know? I felt like I was focused.
591,00:34:21.08,00:34:21.08,I felt like Stephenie was focused.
592,00:34:22.71,00:34:22.71,I thought we were gonna win. I don't know.
593,00:34:25.54,00:34:25.54,I've done all the grunting and getting and going and climbing
594,00:34:28.12,00:34:28.12,"and swinging from vines and all that that I can do,"
595,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,and now it's gonna be between she and I.
596,00:34:32.54,00:34:32.54,I don't want to go home-- I'm gonna feel like a failure
597,00:34:35.04,00:34:35.04,if I go home right now. You know how bad I'll feel?
598,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,">> That's what I said, that's what I said."
599,00:34:38.83,00:34:38.83,">> Like, you know, like... >> To not win one immunity?"
600,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,I know. Tonight we will go to Tribal
601,00:34:43.54,00:34:43.54,"Council, and there will be an individual immunity up for"
602,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,"grabs, some sort of challenge, and we're gonna compete"
603,00:34:47.83,00:34:47.83,against one another to see who stays in the game.
604,00:35:01.12,00:35:01.12,>> There we go. There we go.
605,00:35:04.96,00:35:04.96,Damn. You always get it started.
606,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,"You think, like, tonight whoever stays will come back here"
607,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,by themself? >> Mm-hmm.
608,00:35:16.08,00:35:16.08,">> It's kind of scary, because I don't know"
609,00:35:18.25,00:35:18.25,"what's gonna happen. Like, Ulong will then be down"
610,00:35:20.17,00:35:20.17,"to one remaining member, and I guess that person will come back"
611,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,"here by themselves? It's gonna be tough, just one"
612,00:35:27.75,00:35:27.75,"person trying to do fire, water, go fishing."
613,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,>> Yeah. >> It was scary
614,00:35:31.58,00:35:31.58,"just coming back here with Bobby Jon, but at least I"
615,00:35:34.12,00:35:34.12,"knew I had him, because he does a lot of the work around camp"
616,00:35:37.04,00:35:37.04,"that I can't do. So if I'm here by myself,"
617,00:35:39.38,00:35:39.38,that will be really scary. >> It's gonna be weird.
618,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,>> I know. ( laughs )
619,00:35:45.88,00:35:45.88,">> There may never be a merge, and it may just keep on going"
620,00:35:50.75,00:35:50.75,"one at a time, and if it does, then I'm prepared for it."
621,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,"I'm good at getting fire, I know where every coconut tree"
622,00:35:56.88,00:35:56.88,"is, I know where every little fishing hole is,"
623,00:35:59.42,00:35:59.42,so I can stay out here for weeks by myself.
624,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,">> It's tough because we were teammates all along, and now"
625,00:36:08.88,00:36:08.88,we're competing against one another.
626,00:36:11.25,00:36:11.25,"So it's do or die. If I don't win tonight,"
627,00:36:13.96,00:36:13.96,"I'm out of the game completely. If I win tonight, there is"
628,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,a whole variety of things that could happen.
629,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,"Hey, we need to talk 'cause I, like, have no idea"
630,00:36:22.46,00:36:22.46,what the hell this immunity thing could be.
631,00:36:24.54,00:36:24.54,"It's definitely a challenge, but what kind, do you think?"
632,00:36:26.71,00:36:26.71,>> Stephenie thinks nonstop. I think she even thinks
633,00:36:29.42,00:36:29.42,when she sleeps. So she's thinking right now.
634,00:36:31.54,00:36:31.54,"""How am I gonna kick Bobby Jon's ass?"""
635,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,"That's just how she is, and when it comes down"
636,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,"to being, you know, bad-ass to bad-ass,"
637,00:36:38.17,00:36:38.17,I'll-I'll get... I'll get just as bad-ass with anybody.
638,00:36:43.25,00:36:43.25,>> Let's go. >> Let's do it.
639,00:36:45.50,00:36:45.50,>> All right. >> I been doing
640,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,"this little team thing, and that's fine and cute,"
641,00:36:49.58,00:36:49.58,and I enjoy it and it's great. But I'm kind of getting tired
642,00:36:52.96,00:36:52.96,"of the team thing. It's done, you know?"
643,00:36:55.42,00:36:55.42,This is team Bobby Jon right now.
644,00:37:30.17,00:37:30.17,">> PROBST: So, what's it like being a tribe of two?"
645,00:37:33.54,00:37:33.54,"This is new. Steph, what was it like today?"
646,00:37:36.46,00:37:36.46,">> Um, just enjoyed our time together and just talked, and,"
647,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,"you know, we both think that the strongest members"
648,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,"of Ulong remaining, and whoever wins tonight"
649,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,deserves to be here. >> PROBST: Was today a little
650,00:37:47.58,00:37:47.58,bit bittersweet? It's almost like
651,00:37:50.08,00:37:50.08,"you're the final two, but we're barely halfway"
652,00:37:53.58,00:37:53.58,"into this game. >> You know, it's, like,"
653,00:37:56.17,00:37:56.17,"oh, we're the last two, but, you know,"
654,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,"we've only knocked, like, one little notch out of the game."
655,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,"There's, like, so many things left to do."
656,00:38:03.92,00:38:03.92,"You got to go all the way, and, you know, half's nothing."
657,00:38:06.62,00:38:06.62,>> PROBST: Has there been a highlight for you
658,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,"in these first 21 days, Bobby Jon?"
659,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,">> I think today was, to be honest with you."
660,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,"Catching, like, fish and, like, having success,"
661,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,"you really learn that, you know, hey, you know,"
662,00:38:17.67,00:38:17.67,"you can get by, and you can live off, you know, Mother Nature."
663,00:38:21.25,00:38:21.25,">> PROBST: Steph, how do you feel about your ability to"
664,00:38:23.42,00:38:23.42,survive? Have you learned a few things?
665,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,>> I have. I learned a lot from
666,00:38:27.46,00:38:27.46,"Bobby Jon, actually. Still not so good"
667,00:38:29.21,00:38:29.21,"at spearing fish, but... uh, I know how to..."
668,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,">> She can get coconuts, >> ...coconuts..."
669,00:38:32.71,00:38:32.71,">> ...she can get crabs, and she can start a fire."
670,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,">> I don't know how good myself, but..."
671,00:38:37.08,00:38:37.08,">> She can do anything a man can do,I'll tell you that."
672,00:38:39.71,00:38:39.71,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, what would you say after 21 days"
673,00:38:42.25,00:38:42.25,is the key to survival? What have you learned
674,00:38:44.58,00:38:44.58,that's most important? >> Fire. Fire.
675,00:38:46.46,00:38:46.46,Definitely fire. >> PROBST: Ability to make it?
676,00:38:48.58,00:38:48.58,Keep it going? >> Both.
677,00:38:50.83,00:38:50.83,>> Ability it make it and keep it going.
678,00:38:52.79,00:38:52.79,"You know, we came in today and it was out,"
679,00:38:55.08,00:38:55.08,"and we had to restart it. You know, we just kind of looked"
680,00:38:57.75,00:38:57.75,"at each other like, oh, no, here we go again."
681,00:39:00.04,00:39:00.04,This could take an hour or longer.
682,00:39:02.12,00:39:02.12,">> PROBST: So, Steph, would you agree with Bobby Jon--"
683,00:39:04.12,00:39:04.12,"is fire most essential? I'm, like, frantic without fire."
684,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,"Absolutely. >> PROBST: All right,"
685,00:39:08.75,00:39:08.75,let's get to your immunity challenge.
686,00:39:10.58,00:39:10.58,You want to know what it is? >> Yeah.
687,00:39:13.25,00:39:13.25,>> Yes. >> PROBST: It shouldn't surprise
688,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,you. It is the key to survival:
689,00:39:19.12,00:39:19.12,"the ability to make fire. >> Oh, my God."
690,00:39:22.38,00:39:22.38,>> PROBST: You're both gonna have 25 matches.
691,00:39:25.58,00:39:25.58,You will have a box of kindling and coconut husk.
692,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,The first person to build a fire with a flame high enough
693,00:39:32.25,00:39:32.25,"to light their torch wins immunity, stays in the game."
694,00:39:36.38,00:39:36.38,Loser... goes home. Both feel confident
695,00:39:42.12,00:39:42.12,in your fire-making skills? >> Yeah.
696,00:39:45.79,00:39:45.79,">> I'm not that good. >> PROBST: All right, take a"
697,00:39:49.42,00:39:49.42,"spot over there, and we'll get started."
698,00:39:52.25,00:39:52.25,">> Oh, man. >> Good luck."
699,00:40:06.42,00:40:06.42,>> PROBST: Here we go. Survivors ready.
700,00:40:09.58,00:40:09.58,Begin. Bobby Jon going right
701,00:40:13.25,00:40:13.25,for the coconut husk. They each have the same box
702,00:40:16.75,00:40:16.75,of kindling and coconut husk. And the same amount of matches.
703,00:40:21.79,00:40:21.79,And Steph going for the coconut husk.
704,00:40:33.75,00:40:33.75,Bobby Jon has fire first. Steph right behind.
705,00:40:44.25,00:40:44.25,Steph blowing on it. That's using your brains.
706,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,Steph has a big flame. Bobby Jon trying to keep up.
707,00:41:00.25,00:41:00.25,Steph has a big flame. Steph's torch is lit!
708,00:41:04.17,00:41:04.17,"Just like that, this challenge is over."
709,00:41:06.67,00:41:06.67,"Steph wins immunity. Bobby Jon, I'm sorry,"
710,00:41:11.33,00:41:11.33,"for you it's over. Steph, go ahead and have a seat"
711,00:41:14.17,00:41:14.17,"back on the bench. Bobby Jon, you need"
712,00:41:16.38,00:41:16.38,"to get your torch. >> Hey, good luck."
713,00:41:23.25,00:41:23.25,">> You, too. >> Thank you. See ya."
714,00:41:32.25,00:41:32.25,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, the tribe definitely did not"
715,00:41:34.08,00:41:34.08,"speak tonight. Nonetheless, it's time for"
716,00:41:37.25,00:41:37.25,you to go. So long.
717,00:41:41.25,00:41:41.25,">> Thank you, sir. >> Oh, my God."
718,00:41:54.21,00:41:54.21,This is crazy. >> PROBST: It's just you.
719,00:41:57.04,00:41:57.04,>> It's just me now. >> PROBST: What do you think
720,00:41:59.25,00:41:59.25,tonight's gonna be like? >> It's gonna be scary.
721,00:42:01.08,00:42:01.08,"I mean, I left camp with the fire pretty stoked"
722,00:42:04.00,00:42:04.00,"and, uh, my bed already made, in case I was coming back to it,"
723,00:42:07.83,00:42:07.83,and lots of firewood. So I'm kind of scared.
724,00:42:11.00,00:42:11.00,"Hopefully, I'll have a good night, and tomorrow,"
725,00:42:13.50,00:42:13.50,God knows what that brings. >> PROBST: We'll see what
726,00:42:15.75,00:42:15.75,"tomorrow brings. Grab your torch,"
727,00:42:17.42,00:42:17.42,head on back to camp. You're still alive.
728,00:42:34.46,00:42:34.46,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
729,00:42:39.67,00:42:39.67,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
730,00:42:41.58,00:42:41.58,>> The three of us'll go? >> PROBST: Tom offends Coby.
731,00:42:43.75,00:42:43.75,">> I'll be left out again, as usual."
732,00:42:45.42,00:42:45.42,>> Coby... Coby... >> Hello? I'm still here.
733,00:42:48.25,00:42:48.25,"I'm still trying to participate, you jerks."
734,00:42:50.75,00:42:50.75,>> PROBST: And Stephenie struggles alone at Ulong.
735,00:42:53.25,00:42:53.25,">> This is scary as hell. This is the scariest thing,"
736,00:42:55.50,00:42:55.50,and the hardest thing that I'll ever do.
737,00:43:04.04,00:43:04.04,">> I feel like a brand-new man, I really do."
738,00:43:06.21,00:43:06.21,I wish I could keep going-- I have a lot left in me-- but
739,00:43:09.29,00:43:09.29,"hopefully, I can turn that energy and that attitude to"
740,00:43:11.75,00:43:11.75,something positive from here on out.
741,00:43:13.96,00:43:13.96,"I'm definitely proud of Stephenie, 'cause I think"
742,00:43:16.42,00:43:16.42,she's honestly probably the top player in the game.
743,00:43:18.71,00:43:18.71,I would just tell Stephenie just keep on doing
744,00:43:20.83,00:43:20.83,"what she's doing-- I mean, the girl's almost invincible."
