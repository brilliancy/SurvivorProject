199,00:14:17.00,00:14:17.00,understatement to say that thisgame has just taken a dramatic

217,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,I don't know when I've felt likethis.
218,00:15:48.08,00:15:48.08,"When I saw the mutiny in itscompletion, the numbers were"
219,00:15:51.04,00:15:51.04,scary.Standing there and you're
220,00:15:53.25,00:15:53.25,"feeling so small and pitiful andyou look over to the Raro side,"
221,00:15:56.62,00:15:56.62,and they look so big andtriumphant.
222,00:15:59.46,00:15:59.46,"And when we won the challenge, Icried."
223,00:16:03.04,00:16:03.04,I straight up cried.I don't think I've ever been as

230,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,We had these dry robes that wecould put on.
231,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,And then laid out before us wasevery kind of pastry you can
232,00:16:26.54,00:16:26.54,"think of.It was like a recharge, you"
233,00:16:28.42,00:16:28.42,"know?I feel, like, brand new."
234,00:16:30.29,00:16:30.29,I feel like I'm ready to doanything.
235,00:16:35.38,00:16:35.38,">> Oh, my god!>> Who is it?"
236,00:16:38.25,00:16:38.25,">> Oh, my god!>> That's you?"

238,00:16:44.08,00:16:44.08,I love it.>> That's my son.
239,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,">> Oh, my god, he's adorable.>> Okay, I like this one."
240,00:16:49.29,00:16:49.29,">> All right...>> No, we're seeing these."
241,00:16:54.17,00:16:54.17,>> I'm feeling really good aboutmy tribe.
242,00:16:56.92,00:16:56.92,When you see each other'sfamilies and see pictures of
243,00:16:59.54,00:16:59.54,"each other growing up, I mean,it just really hits you that"
244,00:17:01.83,00:17:01.83,"these are real people thatyou're interacting with, you"
245,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,"know-- people that with hopes,dreams, fears, aspirations."
246,00:17:24.00,00:17:24.00,">> I haven't seen my son inthree weeks, and in the letter,"
247,00:17:26.96,00:17:26.96,"he was like, ""I hope you'refine."""
248,00:17:29.25,00:17:29.25,And he said that he was reallyconcerned that I'm not alone.
249,00:17:33.29,00:17:33.29,"I have a great little boy, andI'm realizing, ""What the hell am"
250,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"I doing here?""But I always teach my son"
251,00:17:40.21,00:17:40.21,"""Winners never quit, andquitters never win,"" so I can't"
252,00:17:43.25,00:17:43.25,teach him that and come out hereand quit.
253,00:17:54.92,00:17:54.92,>> That's Ozzy.>> Ozzy needs a hug.
254,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,>> Aww...>> We are stronger than we've
255,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,ever been.The mutiny solidified our
256,00:18:19.04,00:18:19.04,commitment and dedication toeach other.
257,00:18:21.62,00:18:21.62,"I mean, we're a team to the endnow."
258,00:18:26.25,00:18:26.25,">> Oh, there's nothing in here.I've been waiting the whole time"
259,00:18:34.00,00:18:34.00,to get back with my friends Adamand Parvati.
260,00:18:37.71,00:18:37.71,So I made the decision tomutiny.
261,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"You know, it's four people onthe old Aitu tribe that are"
262,00:18:44.12,00:18:44.12,really mad at me right now.Obviously they're going to have
263,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,it out for me.I was surprised that Jonathan
264,00:18:50.42,00:18:50.42,stepped out right behind me.He's been saying that we were
265,00:18:54.21,00:18:54.21,"really, really close, and we'vebeen tight the whole time, but I"
266,00:18:56.33,00:18:56.33,haven't really trusted Jonathanto begin with.
267,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,"Now I'm here, sitting on ExileIsland by myself, while Jonathan"
268,00:19:04.71,00:19:04.71,"is bonding, having a good time,and I'm out of the game."
269,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,">> Wow, here I am.>> You're back."
270,00:19:19.04,00:19:19.04,">> I took a step into theunknown, guys."
271,00:19:21.17,00:19:21.17,I wanted to be here and meetsome of you folks.
272,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,So were you guys totallyshocked...
273,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,>> I was.>> ...at Candice and I wanting
274,00:19:28.08,00:19:28.08,to come over here?>> No.
275,00:19:29.75,00:19:29.75,>> No?Good.
276,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,">> What?>> I mean, it's a crazy thing to"
277,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,do.And Candice and I are the last
278,00:19:35.21,00:19:35.21,two in here.I don't know how tight you guys
279,00:19:38.12,00:19:38.12,"are, but it seemed like theright thing to do, you know."
280,00:19:41.50,00:19:41.50,"If I've made a mistake it was intrusting Candice too much, and"
281,00:19:44.21,00:19:44.21,she made an impulsive move and Ifollowed her.
282,00:19:47.12,00:19:47.12,So I'm in the danger seat now.I'm the eighth man in.
283,00:19:50.04,00:19:50.04,"I consider myself a loyalperson, and Candice and I have"
284,00:19:54.04,00:19:54.04,been together through the wholething.
285,00:19:57.17,00:19:57.17,"You know, I saw her do it and Isaid, ""Okay, let's go."""
286,00:19:59.50,00:19:59.50,"My game plan is to earn theirtrust, and the only way I can do"
287,00:20:02.79,00:20:02.79,that right now is by beingtotally non-threatening and
288,00:20:05.75,00:20:05.75,"anxious to help.And listen, I hope it doesn't"
289,00:20:08.96,00:20:08.96,"bite me in the butt, but...>> Welcome."
290,00:20:10.92,00:20:10.92,>> Thank you.>> I knew Candice was going to
291,00:20:13.12,00:20:13.12,"come over, but my man Jonathanrolled over too with her."
292,00:20:16.12,00:20:16.12,You must be smoking some goodstuff if you think you're going
293,00:20:19.21,00:20:19.21,"to roll up into our crib andjust start stirring waters, you"
294,00:20:21.50,00:20:21.50,know?Brad is going to be safe for a
295,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,"vote if it has to come to that,you know?"
296,00:20:26.21,00:20:26.21,"Because he at least stood withus and said, ""I'm not budging."""
297,00:20:28.71,00:20:28.71,"So the first one, definitely, isJonathan."
298,00:20:31.58,00:20:31.58,There was no question aboutthat.
299,00:20:33.62,00:20:33.62,To really think we all have yourback after we just saw you sell
300,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,out your other tribe?Are you dumb?
301,00:21:13.29,00:21:13.29,>> You're good around camp.You're a workhorse.
302,00:21:16.42,00:21:16.42,">> I'm out here to do this, youknow?"
303,00:21:18.67,00:21:18.67,We could get voted off tomorrow.I don't know what's going to
304,00:21:20.92,00:21:20.92,happen.>> Yeah.
305,00:21:22.88,00:21:22.88,">> You know what I mean?Sometimes opportunity knocks,"
306,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,you've got to just walk throughthe door and hope for the best.
307,00:21:27.75,00:21:27.75,"So for me and Candice, the riskytime is the next two votes."
308,00:21:31.96,00:21:31.96,">> I know.>> Listen, I don't know what's"
309,00:21:33.88,00:21:33.88,going on over here.>> Yeah.
310,00:21:36.00,00:21:36.00,">> Just so you know, she and Iwanted to come back and deal"
311,00:21:39.29,00:21:39.29,"with you and Parvati.>> Yeah, I know."
312,00:21:41.04,00:21:41.04,"I understand that, I understandthat."
313,00:21:42.92,00:21:42.92,>> You know what I mean?>> That's cool with me.
314,00:21:44.83,00:21:44.83,I'll do that.Because we're the original
315,00:21:46.58,00:21:46.58,"tribe, man.Jonathan really wants myself,"
316,00:21:49.04,00:21:49.04,"him, Candice, and Parvati to bethe final four."
317,00:21:53.62,00:21:53.62,"You know, just to have someonethere that wants that and wants"
318,00:21:57.17,00:21:57.17,to include me is good to havealong the ride.
