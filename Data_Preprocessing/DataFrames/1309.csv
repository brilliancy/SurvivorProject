2,00:00:02.29,00:00:02.29,Survivor... >> I'd rather be on the same
3,00:00:04.38,00:00:04.38,page and know what's going on. >> PROBST: Aitu was uneasy with
4,00:00:06.38,00:00:06.38,their kidnapped Raro member in camp.
5,00:00:08.71,00:00:08.71,>> He's going crazy right now. >> The thing I don't like is
6,00:00:11.25,00:00:11.25,that that whole conversation happened right in front of Nate.
7,00:00:13.25,00:00:13.25,>> PROBST: At the reward challenge...
8,00:00:15.17,00:00:15.17,Rebecca quickly falling behind. ...Aitu forced Nate to sit out.
9,00:00:18.79,00:00:18.79,">> Brad, why aren't you swimming?"
10,00:00:20.75,00:00:20.75,>> Because I'm better at puzzles.
11,00:00:22.54,00:00:22.54,>> PROBST: Nate watched helplessly as his Raro tribe
12,00:00:24.42,00:00:24.42,fell behind and never recovered. Aitu wins reward!
13,00:00:31.00,00:00:31.00,When Nate returned to Raro... >> He knows he's one of our best
14,00:00:33.42,00:00:33.42,swimmers. >> PROBST: ...the tribe
15,00:00:35.50,00:00:35.50,questioned Brad's decision not to swim.
16,00:00:37.50,00:00:37.50,>> We're always choking at the...
17,00:00:39.25,00:00:39.25,">> We need you swimming, brother."
18,00:00:40.92,00:00:40.92,">> The thing is, I'm creative spatial."
19,00:00:42.50,00:00:42.50,I do puzzles. >> Brad pissed me off.
20,00:00:44.21,00:00:44.21,"""I'm good at puzzles."" I don't care about that"
21,00:00:45.75,00:00:45.75,nonsense. >> PROBST: At Aitu...
22,00:00:47.46,00:00:47.46,>> I caught a bird. >> PROBST: ...Ozzy's role as
23,00:00:49.42,00:00:49.42,"provider was a mixed blessing. >> Good job, Oz."
24,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,I underestimated him. We should get rid of him while
25,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17,we still have the control rather than wait for a merge and
26,00:00:56.62,00:00:56.62,potentially have him dominate some of the individual
27,00:00:58.96,00:00:58.96,"challenges. >> PROBST: Go, Nate!"
28,00:01:01.46,00:01:01.46,"At the immunity challenge, Raro made a comeback."
29,00:01:05.96,00:01:05.96,"Raro wins immunity! Aitu, tribal council tonight,"
30,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83,one of you going home. See you at tribal.
31,00:01:12.58,00:01:12.58,">> That's the decision. >> PROBST: Back at Aitu,"
32,00:01:16.04,00:01:16.04,Jonathan targeted Flicka. >> Maybe the choice is Flicka.
33,00:01:18.04,00:01:18.04,I'm trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.
34,00:01:24.04,00:01:24.04,>> PROBST: While Flicka tried to target Jonathan.
35,00:01:30.50,00:01:30.50,>> PROBST: But her scrambling pestered some of the girls.
36,00:01:32.67,00:01:32.67,>> She was like a mosquito that won't die.
37,00:01:37.54,00:01:37.54,">> PROBST: And Ozzy, who was concerned about his own"
38,00:01:39.58,00:01:39.58,"vulnerability, agreed that Jonathan was a threat."
39,00:01:45.79,00:01:45.79,>> Jonathan seems to inspire some level of mistrust among
40,00:01:48.04,00:01:48.04,"pretty much everybody. I haven't seen it, but because"
41,00:01:50.42,00:01:50.42,"everyone else was suspicious of him, I mean, it can't help but"
42,00:01:53.00,00:01:53.00,rub off on me a little bit. >> PROBST: In the end...
43,00:01:56.21,00:01:56.21,Eighth person voted out of the Cook Islands...
44,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,"...Flicka's scrambling became her downfall, and she was voted"
45,00:02:01.58,00:02:01.58,"out. Jessica, the tribe has spoken."
46,00:02:05.42,00:02:05.42,12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

49,00:02:26.21,00:02:26.21,"place, right? We've really done well, the five"
50,00:02:28.08,00:02:28.08,of us. >> We need to stay tight.
51,00:02:29.96,00:02:29.96,>> And we'll continue to stay tight.
52,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,"We know what the next move is if we have an elimination, right?"
53,00:02:35.42,00:02:35.42,"The most solid thing is if we go in with six, and they have four,"
54,00:02:38.88,00:02:38.88,"and we keep Ozzy around for at least one vote, vote somebody"
55,00:02:41.58,00:02:41.58,"off, then vote Ozzy off, and the five of us can,, you know, go to"
56,00:02:44.88,00:02:44.88,town. People are a little antsy as
57,00:02:47.79,00:02:47.79,we're approaching what we think is a merge in the next couple
58,00:02:49.96,00:02:49.96,of days. We have five strong now.
59,00:02:53.12,00:02:53.12,I assume if there's one more immunity challenge and we lose
60,00:02:57.04,00:02:57.04,"it, we will let go of Ozzy. But I don't care how tight you"
61,00:03:03.21,00:03:03.21,"think your fivesome is, things are going to change."
62,00:03:06.12,00:03:06.12,">> You know, anything can happen at this point."
63,00:03:16.75,00:03:16.75,>> I don't want to keep this six through the merge.
64,00:03:20.29,00:03:20.29,I want to get back together with Adam and Parvati.
65,00:03:24.67,00:03:24.67,"So I'm just ready for some movement, get some other people"
66,00:03:26.71,00:03:26.71,out of here. I'm nervous because it's kind of
67,00:03:28.88,00:03:28.88,"like the calm before the storm, you know."
68,00:03:30.92,00:03:30.92,I think stuff's about to start moving.
69,00:05:00.62,00:05:00.62,">> As much as everybody's saying, ""Let's stay together"
70,00:05:03.38,00:05:03.38,"with the six,"" it's going to get to a point where somebody's"
71,00:05:06.12,00:05:06.12,"going to get greedy, you know what I mean?"
72,00:05:08.79,00:05:08.79,"And it's going to get ugly. And I don't, you know...."
73,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,>> I don't want them to do it to me.
74,00:05:14.12,00:05:14.12,>> Right. I don't want to be the one left
75,00:05:16.12,00:05:16.12,out to dry. >> You and I are tight.
76,00:05:18.21,00:05:18.21,We're going to make this work. Set something up with Parvati.
77,00:05:20.88,00:05:20.88,Let's hope we can do that. Maybe it'll be us four
78,00:05:23.88,00:05:23.88,"Caucasians in the final four-- me, you, Adam, Parvati-- and at"
79,00:05:27.33,00:05:27.33,"that point, we have the numbers. And I just think we have to be"
80,00:05:32.29,00:05:32.29,the ones to make that flop before they do.
81,00:05:36.25,00:05:36.25,"I am determined to not be the guy who made the move too late,"
82,00:05:40.08,00:05:40.08,"you know? I've trusted you all along, you"
83,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,"trusted me. And it's gotten us a long way,"
84,00:05:47.79,00:05:47.79,and it's going to get us a long way further.
85,00:05:50.38,00:05:50.38,Candice and I talked a lot about the fact that eventually we were
86,00:05:54.08,00:05:54.08,going to have to do some kind of flop.
87,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,She's the one person that I'm the tightest with.
88,00:05:59.46,00:05:59.46,"Only two people can sit at the final two, and I want it to be"
89,00:06:02.83,00:06:02.83,"you and me, I swear to God. >> Jonathan's got this new plan,"
90,00:06:06.67,00:06:06.67,but I'm not sure that Jonathan has really any allegiance.
91,00:06:09.88,00:06:09.88,"I think he'll do whatever he needs to get by, so I'd like to"
92,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,see Jonathan go. >> Do you think we could merge
93,00:06:23.21,00:06:23.21,now? >> We're going to merge soon.
94,00:06:36.25,00:06:36.25,">> Did you just hear that comment about, ""It's everyone"
95,00:06:40.29,00:06:40.29,"for themselves""? >> I have to play Brad right"
96,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,"now. He has done questionable things,"
97,00:06:49.25,00:06:49.25,"you know? He's Slim Shady right now,"
98,00:06:52.67,00:06:52.67,straight-up. >> That infuriates me that he
99,00:06:55.08,00:06:55.08,said that. It's not an individual game yet.
100,00:06:57.08,00:06:57.08,>> We have to play for our team. >> No.
101,00:07:07.25,00:07:07.25,">> I lost my trust with him, and it sucks, because I like the guy"
102,00:07:09.21,00:07:09.21,a lot. There's still team.
103,00:07:11.88,00:07:11.88,"There's no ""I"" in that team right now for him."
104,00:07:14.17,00:07:14.17,"And so I'll make him think, ""Yeah, dog, I got your back,"
105,00:07:16.12,00:07:16.12,"homey. Yeah, we tight."""
106,00:07:18.29,00:07:18.29,"Sucker. >> PROBST: Raro, come on in."
107,00:07:30.21,00:07:30.21,"Aitu, come on in. Raro getting your first look at"
108,00:07:35.12,00:07:35.12,the new Aitu tribe. Jessica voted out at the last
109,00:07:37.75,00:07:37.75,"tribal council. Okay, before we get to today's"
110,00:07:47.67,00:07:47.67,"reward challenge, we're going to do something a little different."
111,00:07:54.79,00:07:54.79,I'm offering each of you the opportunity to mutiny and join
112,00:08:00.42,00:08:00.42,the other tribe. >> Man!
113,00:08:04.71,00:08:04.71,">> Oh, my god! >> PROBST: You have ten seconds"
114,00:08:11.92,00:08:11.92,to decide whether or not you want to change things up and
115,00:08:14.29,00:08:14.29,maybe change your fate in this game.
116,00:08:17.29,00:08:17.29,"If you want to move, step off your mat and join the other"
117,00:08:19.71,00:08:19.71,tribe. The clock is ticking.
118,00:08:29.08,00:08:29.08,"Five, four, three, two. Candice is mutinying."
119,00:08:38.25,00:08:38.25,One. Jonathan mutinies at the last
120,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,second. That is it.
121,00:08:45.12,00:08:45.12,"Jonathan, Candice, you're Aitu no more."
122,00:08:48.29,00:08:48.29,Join Rarotonga. >> Hi.
123,00:08:51.00,00:08:51.00,>> Hi. >> Welcome back.
124,00:08:54.62,00:08:54.62,">> PROBST: Candice you're now a member of Raro, Jonathan, a"
125,00:08:57.58,00:08:57.58,"member of Raro. So, Aitu, you just had two"
126,00:09:06.00,00:09:06.00,"members of your tribe mutiny. Yul, you don't look happy."
127,00:09:09.33,00:09:09.33,">> No, I'm stunned. I thought we had a pretty good"
128,00:09:11.96,00:09:11.96,"game plan, and I'm very surprised."
129,00:09:14.08,00:09:14.08,">> PROBST: Ozzy, what's your reaction?"
130,00:09:16.17,00:09:16.17,>> It doesn't really surprise me.
131,00:09:18.21,00:09:18.21,"They don't have the backbone to stick with their tribe, then"
132,00:09:20.67,00:09:20.67,that's fine. I'm sure that they're going to
133,00:09:23.12,00:09:23.12,"get their fate sooner or later. >> PROBST: Okay, everybody ready"
134,00:09:26.71,00:09:26.71,to get to today's reward challenge?
135,00:09:29.33,00:09:29.33,Two of you from each tribe will start inside a barrel.
136,00:09:33.83,00:09:33.83,"On my ""go,"" the rest of the tribe will push you through a"
137,00:09:36.62,00:09:36.62,"series of obstacles. Along the way, you'll collect a"
138,00:09:39.67,00:09:39.67,total of four buoys which you'll then use to float the two people
139,00:09:43.96,00:09:43.96,in the barrel across the lagoon. When you reach the center of the
140,00:09:48.88,00:09:48.88,"lagoon, dive down and retrieve four flags."
141,00:09:53.04,00:09:53.04,"When you reach the other side of the lagoon, you'll take those"
142,00:09:56.54,00:09:56.54,four flags and attach them to a flagpole.
143,00:09:59.88,00:09:59.88,"The entire tribe will then dig down, uncover an ax, use that ax"
144,00:10:03.46,00:10:03.46,to chop a rope which will raise your flags.
145,00:10:07.08,00:10:07.08,The first tribe to raise their flags wins reward.
146,00:10:10.38,00:10:10.38,Want to know what you're playing for?
147,00:10:12.25,00:10:12.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: The winning tribe
148,00:10:14.33,00:10:14.33,"will go to a nice, relaxing environment."
149,00:10:16.38,00:10:16.38,"You'll have coffee, some muffins."
150,00:10:20.25,00:10:20.25,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Danishes.
151,00:10:22.50,00:10:22.50,">> Oh, my god! >> PROBST: And because it's"
152,00:10:24.58,00:10:24.58,always nice to have something to read with your morning cup of
153,00:10:26.71,00:10:26.71,"coffee, you will have letters from home written by your loved"
154,00:10:30.08,00:10:30.08,ones for you. Worth playing for?
155,00:10:33.12,00:10:33.12,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: This is going to be
156,00:10:35.38,00:10:35.38,two women and two men from each tribe.
157,00:10:38.21,00:10:38.21,I'll give you a minute to strategize.
158,00:10:42.17,00:10:42.17,"In the barrel for Aitu, it is Becky and Sundra."
159,00:10:46.25,00:10:46.25,"For Raro, Jenny and Candice. Here we go."
160,00:10:49.62,00:10:49.62,Survivors ready? Go!
161,00:10:55.46,00:10:55.46,"Both barrels heading down, a quick ride into the sand."
162,00:11:02.21,00:11:02.21,Ozzy gets the buoys for Aitu! Adam and Nate get the buoys for
163,00:11:06.92,00:11:06.92,Raro! Ozzy back first.
164,00:11:09.46,00:11:09.46,Yul and Ozzy putting the buoys in the barrel.
165,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,Nate and Adam back with their buoys loading in the barrel.
166,00:11:15.54,00:11:15.54,Aitu off and running. Raro right behind.
167,00:11:19.62,00:11:19.62,Aitu with the lead as they get to the log roll.
168,00:11:22.54,00:11:22.54,You've got to roll them over these logs.
169,00:11:25.12,00:11:25.12,Not going to be a comfortable ride.
170,00:11:42.62,00:11:42.62,>> PROBST: Aitu still with a bit of a lead.
171,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,"Nate and Adam right behind. Once you hit your mat, you can"
172,00:11:47.71,00:11:47.71,get your next two buoys. Aitu on the mat!
173,00:11:51.12,00:11:51.12,Raro's on the mat. Ozzy back with the buoys for
174,00:11:55.42,00:11:55.42,Aitu. Nate and Adam back with the
175,00:11:58.67,00:11:58.67,buoys for Raro. Two new tribes battling it out.
176,00:12:01.67,00:12:01.67,Who made the right move? Who made the wrong move?
177,00:12:04.75,00:12:04.75,Candace and Jenny suffocating with all the buoys inside.
178,00:12:12.00,00:12:12.00,Got to get those buoys clipped to the barrels so you can float
179,00:12:15.54,00:12:15.54,across the lagoon. Ozzy and Yul in the water.
180,00:12:24.17,00:12:24.17,Raro still struggling. They've got to get in deeper
181,00:12:26.58,00:12:26.58,water. Aitu is now floating their
182,00:12:29.12,00:12:29.12,barrel. Raro now in the deep enough
183,00:12:33.21,00:12:33.21,"water. They can start floating, but"
184,00:12:35.33,00:12:35.33,Aitu has a big lead at this point.
185,00:12:39.04,00:12:39.04,Aitu has reached their flag. Ozzy's got the first flag.
186,00:12:52.62,00:12:52.62,Raro cannot get there. Ozzy up with the second flag.
187,00:13:01.46,00:13:01.46,Raro is floating away. Ozzy comes up with his final two
188,00:13:09.17,00:13:09.17,flags. He's got all four.
189,00:13:12.21,00:13:12.21,Raro cannot fight the current. Let's go!
190,00:13:17.83,00:13:17.83,"Raro, no chance of getting back. Aitu now on the other side."
191,00:13:26.21,00:13:26.21,Ozzy and Yul have been workhorses on this challenge.
192,00:13:30.21,00:13:30.21,">> Get out, get out! >> PROBST: big reward on the"
193,00:13:33.00,00:13:33.00,line. Somebody going to Exile Island.
194,00:13:37.12,00:13:37.12,Becky's going to hang the flags. >> Come on!
195,00:13:42.71,00:13:42.71,>> PROBST: Aitu has their four flags.
196,00:13:45.88,00:13:45.88,Now they've got to find the ax. They've found the ax.
197,00:13:54.12,00:13:54.12,Aitu wins reward! >> Yes!
198,00:13:56.71,00:13:56.71,>> Yeah! >> Yeah!
199,00:14:08.58,00:14:08.58,"Yeah! >> PROBST: Well, it would be an"
200,00:14:17.00,00:14:17.00,understatement to say that this game has just taken a dramatic
201,00:14:19.54,00:14:19.54,"turn. Aitu, as winners, you are"
202,00:14:22.42,00:14:22.42,sending somebody from the Raro tribe to Exile Island.
203,00:14:25.88,00:14:25.88,>> Hmm... >> PROBST: who's it going to be?
204,00:14:27.92,00:14:27.92,">> Candice. >> PROBST: Candice, big signal"
205,00:14:30.12,00:14:30.12,"coming from your old tribe. Let's go, Candice."
206,00:14:38.17,00:14:38.17,"Raro, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff."
207,00:14:40.50,00:14:40.50,"Head on back to camp. Sundra, you're crying."
208,00:14:45.21,00:14:45.21,">> Because, you know, I wanted to stay true to my guys, and we"
209,00:14:48.04,00:14:48.04,worked well together. Feels good.
210,00:14:51.21,00:14:51.21,">> PROBST: Well, in this case, it certainly paid off to stick"
211,00:14:53.42,00:14:53.42,"together. You have a big reward-- coffee,"
212,00:14:56.04,00:14:56.04,"tasty assortment of pastries, love letters from home just"
213,00:14:59.33,00:14:59.33,behind you. Grab your stuff.
214,00:15:02.54,00:15:02.54,Head on over. >> Whoo!
215,00:15:18.46,00:15:18.46,">> Yeah! >> Oh, my god!"
216,00:15:27.04,00:15:27.04,">> I love you guys! >> Yeah, I can't believe it."
217,00:15:40.79,00:15:40.79,"I can't believe it. >> Me, too."
218,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,I don't know when I've felt like this.
219,00:15:48.08,00:15:48.08,"When I saw the mutiny in its completion, the numbers were"
220,00:15:51.04,00:15:51.04,scary. Standing there and you're
221,00:15:53.25,00:15:53.25,"feeling so small and pitiful and you look over to the Raro side,"
222,00:15:56.62,00:15:56.62,and they look so big and triumphant.
223,00:15:59.46,00:15:59.46,"And when we won the challenge, I cried."
224,00:16:03.04,00:16:03.04,I straight up cried. I don't think I've ever been as
225,00:16:08.08,00:16:08.08,"happy in my life. >> All right, let's have a"
226,00:16:10.96,00:16:10.96,"toast, guys. >> To Aitu."
227,00:16:12.79,00:16:12.79,>> To Aitu. >> To Aitu.
228,00:16:14.38,00:16:14.38,">> Working together, keeping calm, cool, collected."
229,00:16:16.50,00:16:16.50,">> This will take us to the end, guys."
230,00:16:18.29,00:16:18.29,">> Cheers. >> Oh, the reward was beautiful."
231,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,We had these dry robes that we could put on.
232,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,And then laid out before us was every kind of pastry you can
233,00:16:26.54,00:16:26.54,"think of. It was like a recharge, you"
234,00:16:28.42,00:16:28.42,"know? I feel, like, brand new."
235,00:16:30.29,00:16:30.29,I feel like I'm ready to do anything.
236,00:16:35.38,00:16:35.38,">> Oh, my god! >> Who is it?"
237,00:16:38.25,00:16:38.25,">> Oh, my god! >> That's you?"
238,00:16:40.33,00:16:40.33,"Oh, you were so cute! >> Oh, sexy Becky."
239,00:16:44.08,00:16:44.08,I love it. >> That's my son.
240,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,">> Oh, my god, he's adorable. >> Okay, I like this one."
241,00:16:49.29,00:16:49.29,">> All right... >> No, we're seeing these."
242,00:16:54.17,00:16:54.17,>> I'm feeling really good about my tribe.
243,00:16:56.92,00:16:56.92,When you see each other's families and see pictures of
244,00:16:59.54,00:16:59.54,"each other growing up, I mean, it just really hits you that"
245,00:17:01.83,00:17:01.83,"these are real people that you're interacting with, you"
246,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,"know-- people that with hopes, dreams, fears, aspirations."
247,00:17:24.00,00:17:24.00,">> I haven't seen my son in three weeks, and in the letter,"
248,00:17:26.96,00:17:26.96,"he was like, ""I hope you're fine."""
249,00:17:29.25,00:17:29.25,And he said that he was really concerned that I'm not alone.
250,00:17:33.29,00:17:33.29,"I have a great little boy, and I'm realizing, ""What the hell am"
251,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"I doing here?"" But I always teach my son"
252,00:17:40.21,00:17:40.21,"""Winners never quit, and quitters never win,"" so I can't"
253,00:17:43.25,00:17:43.25,teach him that and come out here and quit.
254,00:17:54.92,00:17:54.92,>> That's Ozzy. >> Ozzy needs a hug.
255,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,>> Aww... >> We are stronger than we've
256,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,ever been. The mutiny solidified our
257,00:18:19.04,00:18:19.04,commitment and dedication to each other.
258,00:18:21.62,00:18:21.62,"I mean, we're a team to the end now."
259,00:18:26.25,00:18:26.25,">> Oh, there's nothing in here. I've been waiting the whole time"
260,00:18:34.00,00:18:34.00,to get back with my friends Adam and Parvati.
261,00:18:37.71,00:18:37.71,So I made the decision to mutiny.
262,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"You know, it's four people on the old Aitu tribe that are"
263,00:18:44.12,00:18:44.12,really mad at me right now. Obviously they're going to have
264,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,it out for me. I was surprised that Jonathan
265,00:18:50.42,00:18:50.42,stepped out right behind me. He's been saying that we were
266,00:18:54.21,00:18:54.21,"really, really close, and we've been tight the whole time, but I"
267,00:18:56.33,00:18:56.33,haven't really trusted Jonathan to begin with.
268,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,"Now I'm here, sitting on Exile Island by myself, while Jonathan"
269,00:19:04.71,00:19:04.71,"is bonding, having a good time, and I'm out of the game."
270,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,">> Wow, here I am. >> You're back."
271,00:19:19.04,00:19:19.04,">> I took a step into the unknown, guys."
272,00:19:21.17,00:19:21.17,I wanted to be here and meet some of you folks.
273,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,So were you guys totally shocked...
274,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,>> I was. >> ...at Candice and I wanting
275,00:19:28.08,00:19:28.08,to come over here? >> No.
276,00:19:29.75,00:19:29.75,>> No? Good.
277,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,">> What? >> I mean, it's a crazy thing to"
278,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,do. And Candice and I are the last
279,00:19:35.21,00:19:35.21,two in here. I don't know how tight you guys
280,00:19:38.12,00:19:38.12,"are, but it seemed like the right thing to do, you know."
281,00:19:41.50,00:19:41.50,"If I've made a mistake it was in trusting Candice too much, and"
282,00:19:44.21,00:19:44.21,she made an impulsive move and I followed her.
283,00:19:47.12,00:19:47.12,So I'm in the danger seat now. I'm the eighth man in.
284,00:19:50.04,00:19:50.04,"I consider myself a loyal person, and Candice and I have"
285,00:19:54.04,00:19:54.04,been together through the whole thing.
286,00:19:57.17,00:19:57.17,"You know, I saw her do it and I said, ""Okay, let's go."""
287,00:19:59.50,00:19:59.50,"My game plan is to earn their trust, and the only way I can do"
288,00:20:02.79,00:20:02.79,that right now is by being totally non-threatening and
289,00:20:05.75,00:20:05.75,"anxious to help. And listen, I hope it doesn't"
290,00:20:08.96,00:20:08.96,"bite me in the butt, but... >> Welcome."
291,00:20:10.92,00:20:10.92,>> Thank you. >> I knew Candice was going to
292,00:20:13.12,00:20:13.12,"come over, but my man Jonathan rolled over too with her."
293,00:20:16.12,00:20:16.12,You must be smoking some good stuff if you think you're going
294,00:20:19.21,00:20:19.21,"to roll up into our crib and just start stirring waters, you"
295,00:20:21.50,00:20:21.50,know? Brad is going to be safe for a
296,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,"vote if it has to come to that, you know?"
297,00:20:26.21,00:20:26.21,"Because he at least stood with us and said, ""I'm not budging."""
298,00:20:28.71,00:20:28.71,"So the first one, definitely, is Jonathan."
299,00:20:31.58,00:20:31.58,There was no question about that.
300,00:20:33.62,00:20:33.62,To really think we all have your back after we just saw you sell
301,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,out your other tribe? Are you dumb?
302,00:21:13.29,00:21:13.29,>> You're good around camp. You're a workhorse.
303,00:21:16.42,00:21:16.42,">> I'm out here to do this, you know?"
304,00:21:18.67,00:21:18.67,We could get voted off tomorrow. I don't know what's going to
305,00:21:20.92,00:21:20.92,happen. >> Yeah.
306,00:21:22.88,00:21:22.88,">> You know what I mean? Sometimes opportunity knocks,"
307,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,you've got to just walk through the door and hope for the best.
308,00:21:27.75,00:21:27.75,"So for me and Candice, the risky time is the next two votes."
309,00:21:31.96,00:21:31.96,">> I know. >> Listen, I don't know what's"
310,00:21:33.88,00:21:33.88,going on over here. >> Yeah.
311,00:21:36.00,00:21:36.00,">> Just so you know, she and I wanted to come back and deal"
312,00:21:39.29,00:21:39.29,"with you and Parvati. >> Yeah, I know."
313,00:21:41.04,00:21:41.04,"I understand that, I understand that."
314,00:21:42.92,00:21:42.92,>> You know what I mean? >> That's cool with me.
315,00:21:44.83,00:21:44.83,I'll do that. Because we're the original
316,00:21:46.58,00:21:46.58,"tribe, man. Jonathan really wants myself,"
317,00:21:49.04,00:21:49.04,"him, Candice, and Parvati to be the final four."
318,00:21:53.62,00:21:53.62,"You know, just to have someone there that wants that and wants"
319,00:21:57.17,00:21:57.17,to include me is good to have along the ride.
320,00:22:13.33,00:22:13.33,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Candice,"
321,00:22:23.08,00:22:23.08,"returning from Exile Island. >> Hey, guys."
322,00:22:34.12,00:22:34.12,>> Hey! >> PROBST: You guys ready to get
323,00:22:42.25,00:22:42.25,to today's challenge? >> Yeah.
324,00:22:44.04,00:22:44.04,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, first"
325,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,things first. Let's take back immunity.
326,00:22:51.00,00:22:51.00,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
327,00:22:53.50,00:22:53.50,"For today's challenge, you will paddle out in glass-bottom boats"
328,00:22:57.54,00:22:57.54,searching for three underwater targets.
329,00:23:01.92,00:23:01.92,When you line up the crosshairs on your target with the
330,00:23:05.58,00:23:05.58,"crosshairs on your boat, you'll release a cannonball, which will"
331,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,"drop from the boat, hitting a target, releasing a pair of"
332,00:23:11.96,00:23:11.96,buoys. When you have all the buoys back
333,00:23:14.25,00:23:14.25,"to shore, use the buoys to solve a word puzzle."
334,00:23:18.50,00:23:18.50,One buoy provides a clue. The rest of the buoys will form
335,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,the one-word answer. First tribe to solve it
336,00:23:25.25,00:23:25.25,"correctly wins immunity, guaranteed a one in 11 shot at a"
337,00:23:28.46,00:23:28.46,million bucks. Losers go to tribal council
338,00:23:31.21,00:23:31.21,tonight. Somebody will be voted out.
339,00:23:33.96,00:23:33.96,Make sense? >> Yes.
340,00:23:36.04,00:23:36.04,">> PROBST: Raro, you have four extra members."
341,00:23:37.96,00:23:37.96,You cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back
342,00:23:39.96,00:23:39.96,"challenges, so your decision is made."
343,00:23:42.12,00:23:42.12,The people who participated yesterday will sit out today.
344,00:23:44.46,00:23:44.46,"Take your spots, we'll get started."
345,00:23:47.42,00:23:47.42,"All right, for Raro it's Parvati, Jonathan, Rebecca, and"
346,00:23:50.25,00:23:50.25,"Brad taking on Becky, Ozzy, Yul, and Sundra for Aitu."
347,00:23:55.29,00:23:55.29,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
348,00:23:59.33,00:23:59.33,Go! You're looking for three targets
349,00:24:05.04,00:24:05.04,releasing three pairs of buoys. Both tribes pushing their boats
350,00:24:09.75,00:24:09.75,"as far as they can. >> Get in, Yul."
351,00:24:15.38,00:24:15.38,>> PROBST: Aitu first to start paddling.
352,00:24:17.42,00:24:17.42,Raro is paddling. Raro immediately off the course.
353,00:24:20.96,00:24:20.96,">> Turn, turn, left. >> I see the first one over"
354,00:24:24.21,00:24:24.21,here. I see the first one over here.
355,00:24:26.25,00:24:26.25,">> Okay. >> All right, slow down, slow"
356,00:24:28.29,00:24:28.29,down. >> Okay.
357,00:24:30.25,00:24:30.25,">> Backpedal, backpedal. >> PROBST: Aitu trying to line"
358,00:24:32.04,00:24:32.04,"up their first target. >> Okay, tell me whenever you're"
359,00:24:33.62,00:24:33.62,"ready. One, two... drop it."
360,00:24:36.21,00:24:36.21,Do it! >> PROBST: Aitu releases a
361,00:24:40.33,00:24:40.33,cannonball. >> We were right on it.
362,00:24:42.42,00:24:42.42,">> PROBST: Just off. >> Over here, straight!"
363,00:24:44.79,00:24:44.79,>> PROBST: Both tribes searching for that first set of buoys.
364,00:24:50.33,00:24:50.33,Raro very close to their buoys. >> You guys ready?
365,00:24:54.21,00:24:54.21,>> PROBST: Brad and Parvati trying to line it up.
366,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,">> Okay. >> Drop, drop, drop, drop!"
367,00:25:00.50,00:25:00.50,>> PROBST: Jonathan releases a cannonball for Raro.
368,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,>> Backwards. Straight back.
369,00:25:05.38,00:25:05.38,">> PROBST: Misses the target. >> Backpedal a little bit, just"
370,00:25:07.25,00:25:07.25,"a little. >> PROBST: Aitu, can they get"
371,00:25:10.08,00:25:10.08,"the crosshairs lined up? >> Just a little bit, drop!"
372,00:25:16.21,00:25:16.21,>> PROBST: No luck. This challenge demands that you
373,00:25:19.58,00:25:19.58,"work together well. >> Brad, paddle a little bit on"
374,00:25:22.25,00:25:22.25,your side. >> PROBST: Raro easing into
375,00:25:25.50,00:25:25.50,"it... >> Okay, a little bit more."

389,00:26:13.00,00:26:13.00,>> Should I just go for it? >> No.
390,00:26:15.46,00:26:15.46,>> I think I got it. I got it!
391,00:26:19.50,00:26:19.50,"See? >> Oh, my gosh!"

404,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"their second set of buoys. We are now tied, two sets each."

407,00:27:09.08,00:27:09.08,"one target left. >> All right, all right, let's"
408,00:27:11.58,00:27:11.58,"get the last one, guys. >> And go, go, go!"
409,00:27:19.38,00:27:19.38,">> Release again, release! Backwards."

412,00:27:28.46,00:27:28.46,>> Raro just wasted a cannonball.
413,00:27:30.29,00:27:30.29,"They weren't paying attention. >> Oh, please, Jeff."
414,00:27:32.54,00:27:32.54,">> PROBST: What's that? >> I said, oh, please!"

418,00:27:50.42,00:27:50.42,>> Yeah! >> Yes!

420,00:27:54.50,00:27:54.50,buoys. Aitu now has all three sets.

422,00:28:00.92,00:28:00.92,Raro still right on top of their third set of buoys.
423,00:28:04.21,00:28:04.21,Going after another shot. >> I got it!

427,00:28:18.04,00:28:18.04,>> We blew it! >> Did it drop?
428,00:28:20.88,00:28:20.88,">> All right, we're on the mat. >> PROBST: Aitu back to the mat."
429,00:28:23.00,00:28:23.00,Got to get all their buoys back to the big mat.
430,00:28:25.96,00:28:25.96,">> Let's go! >> Jonathan, paddle forward."
431,00:28:30.38,00:28:30.38,Don't watch them. Look at what we're doing.
432,00:28:33.21,00:28:33.21,">> All right, this says ""The most famous mutiny in history"

436,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,>> Are you kidding me? >> Son of a...
437,00:29:02.92,00:29:02.92,">> PROBST: Well, Aitu, another big win today."
438,00:29:06.04,00:29:06.04,"Immunity, no tribal council, nobody going home."
439,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,">> Thanks, Jeff. >> PROBST: On the other side of"
440,00:29:12.25,00:29:12.25,"the coin, Raro, two big losses. Tribal council tonight."
441,00:29:16.25,00:29:16.25,Somebody from this tribe will be voted out of this game.
442,00:29:18.79,00:29:18.79,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
443,00:29:20.50,00:29:20.50,I'll see you at tribal. >> I'm so bummed out.
444,00:29:49.92,00:29:49.92,">> So sorry, guys. >> Goodness, gracious, that was"
445,00:29:53.25,00:29:53.25,stupid. >> I saw you say that...
446,00:29:57.04,00:29:57.04,">> I'm a little hungry, but it was..."
447,00:29:58.75,00:29:58.75,">> Well, luckily, you were only out there one night and it"
448,00:30:00.79,00:30:00.79,"wasn't raining, right? >> Yeah, yeah."
449,00:30:03.33,00:30:03.33,>> I'm happy to have Candice back from Exile Island.
450,00:30:06.00,00:30:06.00,It takes a little bit of the onus off of me being the only
451,00:30:09.21,00:30:09.21,new guy. They can see who the two of us
452,00:30:11.38,00:30:11.38,"are, and she and I have trusted each other."
453,00:30:33.62,00:30:33.62,>> Not tight. >> Not tight?
454,00:30:35.42,00:30:35.42,Not too tight? >> No.
455,00:30:37.08,00:30:37.08,">> Okay, good. >> Not too tight at all."
456,00:30:39.04,00:30:39.04,"I was shocked. He had, like, long talks with"
457,00:30:41.46,00:30:41.46,Yul all the time. And he only really came back and
458,00:30:44.12,00:30:44.12,"tried to, like, solidify something with me in the past"
459,00:30:46.83,00:30:46.83,few days. He's just doing whatever is best
460,00:30:49.46,00:30:49.46,"for him and, like, working everybody at the same time, you"
461,00:30:51.38,00:30:51.38,know what I mean? >> What's up?
462,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17,">> Jonathan, AKA ""Lord Knows What He's Thinking Knucklehead,"""
463,00:31:44.12,00:31:44.12,"to leave his tribe, is working very hard around here."
464,00:31:49.17,00:31:49.17,"So right now, we're going to do away with Brad, because we're"
465,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,"scared if we go to a merge, he's going to go with Becky and Yul."
466,00:31:57.67,00:31:57.67,I've got to put a Denzel on today and play Brad like it's
467,00:32:01.21,00:32:01.21,"all good, you know, like, keep him in the loop."
468,00:32:03.38,00:32:03.38,"He thinks I'm out to cut up Jonathan, so I'm going to let"
469,00:32:05.75,00:32:05.75,him think he's safe. ( yawns )
470,00:32:10.75,00:32:10.75,"What's up, brother? >> What's up?"
471,00:32:13.12,00:32:13.12,Were you sleeping? >> Uh-huh.
472,00:33:12.62,00:33:12.62,">> Who? >> Okay, that's fine."
473,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,>> Candice informed me that Jonathan's been running his
474,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,"mouth a little bit, just talking trash, which I think is funny"
475,00:33:45.88,00:33:45.88,because now he's kissing my butt along with everybody else's butt
476,00:33:50.33,00:33:50.33,"in our tribe. So he can just kiss our butts,"
477,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,and we'll go ahead and vote him off after that.
478,00:34:13.62,00:34:13.62,>> I want to get rid of that kid.
479,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,"I mean, now he's kissing everyone's butt after that."
480,00:34:17.50,00:34:17.50,">> I told you, man, he's a punk- ass..."
481,00:34:19.21,00:34:19.21,>> I know he is. He's a punk.
482,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,"But, I mean, we can't switch now."
483,00:34:22.58,00:34:22.58,I'm going to beat his ass. >> He's a punk.
484,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,>> He's a punk. >> My man Adam wants to take a
485,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,brick and beat Jonathan in the head with it.
486,00:34:34.08,00:34:34.08,">> You know, I told you I smelled dookie, dog."
487,00:34:36.12,00:34:36.12,>> Pisses me off. >> But we've got to think smart.
488,00:34:39.21,00:34:39.21,"Game's not over yet, so it's a fair playing ground."
489,00:35:08.17,00:35:08.17,>> PROBST: Looks like it's going to be a wet night.
490,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,"So let's talk about the mutiny. Brad, when you saw Candice step"
491,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,"off the mat, followed right behind by Jonathan, what was"
492,00:35:19.00,00:35:19.00,"your initial thought? >> My initial thought was, ""Wow,"
493,00:35:23.08,00:35:23.08,"that is one gutsy girl."" I mean, here she has four people"
494,00:35:26.62,00:35:26.62,"now vying against her. >> PROBST: Jenny, is there a"
495,00:35:30.29,00:35:30.29,"part of you thinking, ""Well, you know what, that's okay""?"
496,00:35:32.75,00:35:32.75,They're at the bottom of the totem pole.
497,00:35:34.88,00:35:34.88,They need to know that. >> Even though they're on the
498,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,bottom of the totem pole we have an advantage compared to the
499,00:35:40.04,00:35:40.04,"Aitu. And if we merge, we're just"
500,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,going to pick them off like zits.
501,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,I've been hanging around Nate too long.
502,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,">> PROBST: Candice, are you okay with the fact that this tribe"
503,00:35:54.29,00:35:54.29,"comes to tribal council, where somebody is going to be voted"
504,00:35:57.75,00:35:57.75,"out, and there's joking and laughter?"
505,00:36:00.29,00:36:00.29,">> I think that's the great thing about this tribe, and it's"
506,00:36:03.00,00:36:03.00,one of the reasons I stepped out on the mat.
507,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,I felt like this tribe has a good time.
508,00:36:08.38,00:36:08.38,">> PROBST: So you're telling me, Candice, that you stepped off"
509,00:36:11.00,00:36:11.00,that mat because you could just sense that Raro was just a lot
510,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,more fun? >> I didn't say that was the
511,00:36:16.67,00:36:16.67,only reason. That's one of the reasons.
512,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,"I mean, they win when it counts. >> PROBST: Jonathan, are you a"
513,00:36:21.58,00:36:21.58,"little bit concerned that ""I could be an easy guy to get rid"
514,00:36:24.50,00:36:24.50,"of?"" Because they didn't invite you"
515,00:36:26.62,00:36:26.62,over. You were given the opportunity
516,00:36:28.67,00:36:28.67,"to just join them. >> Of course I'm concerned, you"
517,00:36:30.88,00:36:30.88,know? I was the last guy off the mat.
518,00:36:33.21,00:36:33.21,"Maybe it was a second later. But yes, you know, somebody's"
519,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,"going to go home tonight, and I'd be silly if I didn't think"
520,00:36:38.71,00:36:38.71,"it could be me. >> PROBST: Nate, what's your"
521,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,"take on this unit right now as a tribe, or as a family, whatever"
522,00:36:48.21,00:36:48.21,you want to call it? >> My six I had yesterday before
523,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"mutiny, I was all good with. The other two coming in, Candice"
524,00:36:55.33,00:36:55.33,"and Jonathan, they seem very nice, so, you know, we're still"
525,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,"adapting to them. I can't really give you a fair,"
526,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,honest answer about them because I'm still reading them.
527,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,>> PROBST: What would be the concern about Candice?
528,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,">> Oh, the girls may find her as a threat because she's pretty"
529,00:37:09.79,00:37:09.79,"lethal-- the only female who has ever been to exile, and, you"
530,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,"know, she comes up with her head high from it, too."
531,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,"And, like, she's a very strong competitor."
532,00:37:18.04,00:37:18.04,The girl came to play. >> PROBST: What would be your
533,00:37:20.50,00:37:20.50,concern about Jonathan coming over?
534,00:37:23.04,00:37:23.04,">> Maybe he has a tendency to be too much of a leader, and we"
535,00:37:26.67,00:37:26.67,don't dig that over here. We find out you're leading
536,00:37:29.25,00:37:29.25,"around here, we'll cut you up, you know?"
537,00:37:31.54,00:37:31.54,">> PROBST: Jonathan, hearing Nate say that, is it a fair"
538,00:37:35.54,00:37:35.54,"assessment? >> You know, yes, I'm an odd man"
539,00:37:39.42,00:37:39.42,"out at this point, and I do want to fit in."
540,00:37:42.00,00:37:42.00,"You know, in the last 24 hours, I think I've at least tried to"
541,00:37:45.08,00:37:45.08,"certainly not step on anybody's toes and tried to, you know,"
542,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"provide. >> PROBST: Brad, did you sense"
543,00:37:50.88,00:37:50.88,any tension in this tribe? >> I like Jonathan.
544,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,I like Candice from the six hours that I know of.
545,00:37:57.21,00:37:57.21,"I've got no qualms with them. The only thing is, they're"
546,00:38:00.25,00:38:00.25,"stepping in late in the ball game, and that's what I can see"
547,00:38:02.79,00:38:02.79,as a huge deterrent for them being successful within this
548,00:38:05.25,00:38:05.25,tribe. And that's it.
549,00:38:07.08,00:38:07.08,That's the bottom line. >> PROBST: Do you trust these
550,00:38:09.38,00:38:09.38,people in this tribe now? >> No.
551,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,">> PROBST: Wow. You don't trust this big, happy"
552,00:38:15.29,00:38:15.29,family? >> Do I trust the entire tribe?
553,00:38:17.88,00:38:17.88,Absolutely not. I'm sorry.
554,00:38:20.62,00:38:20.62,"It's been 21 days, and trust is a big word to me, Jeff, and no,"
555,00:38:25.08,00:38:25.08,I don't trust everyone on this tribe.
556,00:38:27.17,00:38:27.17,>> PROBST: Okay. If somebody has the hidden
557,00:38:29.50,00:38:29.50,"immunity idol, and it turns out that you do need to play it, you"
558,00:38:32.17,00:38:32.17,would present it to me after the vote.
