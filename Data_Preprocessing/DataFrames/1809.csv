241,00:16:07.83,00:16:07.83,>> I'm sorry.>> I wanted to get on that river
242,00:16:10.29,00:16:10.29,in some type of raft or kayaksince I got here.
243,00:16:16.00,00:16:16.00,">> I mean, I expect Brendantrying to scheme."
244,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,"I'm not really that worried,Brendan being gone with J.T."
245,00:16:21.17,00:16:21.17,and Debbie.Those are two of the strongest
246,00:16:22.54,00:16:22.54,"allies.So, it actually worked out well."
247,00:16:25.71,00:16:25.71,I just hope the extra foodBrendan gets isn't going to
248,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,hurt our chances for winningimmunity.
249,00:16:39.96,00:16:39.96,">> Clue six: ""A big wooden headis what you have here."
250,00:16:43.21,00:16:43.21,"Look in the gap that you'llfind in the rear."""
251,00:16:46.58,00:16:46.58,No surprise here.Great.
252,00:16:48.79,00:16:48.79,This is my first Exile out herealone.
253,00:16:50.96,00:16:50.96,"It's the first of anybody'sExiles out here alone, and I got"
254,00:16:53.33,00:16:53.33,the new clue to the same idolsthat we know about.
255,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,"So, I know there's no new idolin the game."
256,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,I'm definitely concerned aboutbeing on Exile.
257,00:17:08.21,00:17:08.21,I haven't made fire yet at camp.I tried a few times and I
258,00:17:11.54,00:17:11.54,"failed, and I was soembarrassed I hadn't tried"
259,00:17:13.88,00:17:13.88,"again.So, I knew that by forcing"
260,00:17:17.17,00:17:17.17,"myself to come out here, eitherI would make fire, make food,"
261,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,or I would die.It looked like I might die.
262,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,"I was trying for about an houror two to make fire, just"
263,00:17:36.38,00:17:36.38,smacking that flint over andover again with a machete.
264,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,And nothing.How about that!
265,00:17:48.62,00:17:48.62,"Damn, I can build a fire!How about that!"
266,00:17:52.04,00:17:52.04,"Finally, as darkness wasstarting to close around me,"
267,00:17:55.04,00:17:55.04,I got a spark; it caught; andthe whole thing took.
268,00:17:59.04,00:17:59.04,It was like giving birth to myfirst child.
269,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,I felt so proud of that littlefire that I just wanted to stay
270,00:18:03.88,00:18:03.88,out here and tend to it for therest of my life.
271,00:18:07.54,00:18:07.54,"So, even though I missed out onthat good lunch and a fun,"
272,00:18:10.50,00:18:10.50,"relaxing, water rafting trip,being out here and making it"
273,00:18:14.04,00:18:14.04,"is like winning my own reward.>> Brendan, myself, and Debbie"
274,00:18:42.29,00:18:42.29,"went to the reward, and we hada blast."
275,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,I've actually never been ableto go whitewater rafting and
276,00:18:47.46,00:18:47.46,that's something I've alwayswanted to do forever.
277,00:18:50.42,00:18:50.42,I felt just like a little kid.>> A-ha!
278,00:18:56.12,00:18:56.12,>> Yeah!>> Great job!
279,00:19:03.12,00:19:03.12,>> The reward was so much fun.The pure joy that was on J.T.'s
280,00:19:07.54,00:19:07.54,face to see how much he justsoaks it up and appreciates it.
281,00:19:11.46,00:19:11.46,"What a great soul.So sincere, so real."
282,00:19:14.17,00:19:14.17,"Like, all qualities that youwant in people that surround"
283,00:19:18.04,00:19:18.04,you or at least I do.>> Forza!
284,00:19:25.46,00:19:25.46,">> After we did, like, the bestrafting ever, we came along"
285,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,this huge sandbar and I knew itwas our picnic.
286,00:19:32.12,00:19:32.12,>> This is amazing!I've died and gone to heaven.
287,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,Chips!There's chips!
288,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,"Oh, my God!Look at those brownies!"
289,00:19:40.92,00:19:40.92,"Whoo!Oh, my God."
290,00:19:44.12,00:19:44.12,This is the best food in theworld.
291,00:19:47.21,00:19:47.21,">> Oh, my God!I had a really good day."
292,00:19:52.12,00:19:52.12,"I mean, it was a lot betterthan I had pictured."
293,00:19:53.79,00:19:53.79,I figured Brendan and I beingtogether would kind of be a
294,00:19:56.54,00:19:56.54,"dull trip, but there wasn't adull moment at all."
295,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,>> No?>> About what?
296,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,">> Just about how to, you know.>> Keep me in the game a little"
297,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,longer.>> Have some fun.
298,00:20:15.04,00:20:15.04,">> If there's an opportunity,I damn sure will do what I can"
299,00:20:17.12,00:20:17.12,"do, whatever I can.>> All right, yeah."
300,00:20:20.08,00:20:20.08,I always kind of define winningin a lot of my life of saying
301,00:20:22.50,00:20:22.50,"like, I'm going to be #1.If I take J.T. in the finals"
302,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,"with me, he's going to beat me.I know it's crazy, but for me,"
303,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,winning in this game is aboutgetting to an outcome at the
304,00:20:31.67,00:20:31.67,end of the game which is goingto satisfy me.
305,00:20:35.46,00:20:35.46,"If he wins it, that's like mewinning this game."
306,00:20:38.67,00:20:38.67,How do I get him to the finals?I don't know.
307,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,That's the next step I need towrap my head around.
308,00:20:43.50,00:20:43.50,"Let's have some fun.>> I'm definitely up for it,"
309,00:20:45.46,00:20:45.46,man.>> I stayed up all night.
310,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,"I sat in that shelter and didnot sleep at all, just running"
311,00:21:06.38,00:21:06.38,through all the differentscenarios about how do I get
312,00:21:08.33,00:21:08.33,"J.T. to the finals.And at a certain point, all the"
313,00:21:11.58,00:21:11.58,"pieces, like, just fell and youcould see the puzzle and how it"
314,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,needs to be put together. >> Here's how we're gonna do
315,00:21:21.67,00:21:21.67,"it. Um, I don't think we should send"
316,00:21:24.12,00:21:24.12,J.T. home.We had the awesome time.
317,00:21:30.96,00:21:30.96,He's such a good dude.Debbie had such a good time
318,00:21:33.25,00:21:33.25,with him.>> He is.
319,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,He's one of the most amazingpeople I have ever met in my
320,00:21:36.92,00:21:36.92,life.>> I think what we should do is
321,00:21:39.00,00:21:39.00,"you, me, Taj, Stephen, J.T.,take out Tyson, Coach, and"
322,00:21:46.42,00:21:46.42,Erinn.Start taking them out.
323,00:21:50.33,00:21:50.33,">> This morning, Brendan islike, ""All right, here's what's"
324,00:21:52.25,00:21:52.25,going on.I really like J.T.

336,00:22:37.33,00:22:37.33,I really want to know what thatword stands for because it
337,00:22:39.42,00:22:39.42,"could mean ""confused.""Coach and Tyson want to"

339,00:22:46.33,00:22:46.33,Tyson or Coach.We haven't even had to really
340,00:22:49.25,00:22:49.25,put any plans into action yetbecause they're so busy trying
341,00:22:51.79,00:22:51.79,to get out their own tribemembers right now.

649,00:42:54.29,00:42:54.29,needs most is in my pocket rightnow: the hidden immunity idol.
650,00:42:57.54,00:42:57.54,"But it doesn't matter.She'd be next, regardless, to"
