14,00:00:49.21,00:00:49.21,But everyone's plans were cut short when Joe was evacuated.
15,00:00:53.54,00:00:53.54,Joe's been battling a pretty decent infection.
16,00:00:56.21,00:00:56.21,Medical did a thorough assessment.
17,00:00:58.46,00:00:58.46,He can't continue. >> What?!
18,00:01:01.25,00:01:01.25,">> PROBST: So, no Tribal Council."

22,00:01:34.58,00:01:34.58,">> That sucks. Joe left camp today, and it was"
23,00:01:38.88,00:01:38.88,just kind of this funk that was permeating the camp.
24,00:01:41.67,00:01:41.67,"And we're sitting around there, looking at the fire."
25,00:01:43.67,00:01:43.67,Nobody was saying anything. And I just wanted to share a
26,00:01:50.79,00:01:50.79,piece of my life with them. I wanted to show them that no
27,00:01:53.67,00:01:53.67,"matter how bad it gets in your life, there's always something"
28,00:01:58.92,00:01:58.92,that's going to make it much worse.
29,00:02:07.29,00:02:07.29,">> I want to hear this story. >> So, I shared with the tribe"
30,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,one of the stories about the time that I got caught in the
31,00:02:12.83,00:02:12.83,Amazon and thought I was going to get killed.
32,00:02:43.46,00:02:43.46,"Now, they were probably, you know, four, four and a half"
33,00:02:46.75,00:02:46.75,feet tall. I paddled so hard that my hands
34,00:03:28.88,00:03:28.88,"started bleeding. >> You don't want to say,"
35,00:03:40.46,00:03:40.46,"""Coach, hey, let's have a reality check here."
36,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,But no one said a word. It was silent when he finished
37,00:03:48.04,00:03:48.04,"and everybody was kind of going around looking at each other,"
38,00:03:50.42,00:03:50.42,"like, ""Whoa!"" >> How much does it cost to get"
39,00:03:56.17,00:03:56.17,a military copter to drop you in?
40,00:03:58.21,00:03:58.21,>> That would be free. >> How?
41,00:04:04.04,00:04:04.04,">> Honestly, like, you know, Coach is either the new coming"
42,00:04:07.96,00:04:07.96,"of Jacques Cousteau, or he's, you know, basically the biggest"
43,00:04:11.92,00:04:11.92,"fraud that is in this game. >> They were just, like,"
44,00:04:14.12,00:04:14.12,ecstatic that I wanted to come down there.
45,00:04:23.21,00:04:23.21,>> I don't believe this guy anymore.
46,00:04:25.25,00:04:25.25,"And if I don't believe his stories, how I can believe what"
47,00:04:27.25,00:04:27.25,he's saying to my face? (theme song playing)

58,00:06:27.67,00:06:27.67,"so Brendan is going home. >> Hi, guys."

60,00:06:34.92,00:06:34.92,far. >> What's it from?
61,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,"Like, where is that...? >> Yeah, it's called chong ran."
62,00:06:40.08,00:06:40.08,"And it's, uh, ancient Tibetan. If you do a Google search on"
63,00:06:43.04,00:06:43.04,"it, you won't find it. It's only passed down verbally."
64,00:06:45.00,00:06:45.00,You have to go there to the monastery to study it.

66,00:06:59.71,00:06:59.71,>> I feel like I'm in control of this game.
67,00:07:01.62,00:07:01.62,"I have the power alliance, commanding my officers, running"
68,00:07:04.50,00:07:04.50,"the show, like I was born to do. You know, if you look at it, to"
69,00:07:09.08,00:07:09.08,"defeat an army, you have to cut off the head of the dragon,"
70,00:07:11.21,00:07:11.21,"which is why I nicknamed Brendan ""the dragon."""
71,00:07:13.83,00:07:13.83,"Hence, my name, the ""Dragonslayer."""
72,00:07:16.42,00:07:16.42,Where does Sierra fit into all this?
73,00:07:17.88,00:07:17.88,"With the comments that she made today, Sierra is the bowel"
74,00:07:22.00,00:07:22.00,movements that come out of the dragon.
75,00:07:25.29,00:07:25.29,"After Brendan, Sierra's got to go."
76,00:07:37.12,00:07:37.12,">> Worried about Joe? >> Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's"
77,00:07:40.54,00:07:40.54,doing fine. I hate having him leave the
78,00:07:42.25,00:07:42.25,game. >> I know.
79,00:07:43.62,00:07:43.62,"Well, you guys were such good friends, too."
80,00:07:46.08,00:07:46.08,">> I know. >> Like, I was so happy to have"
81,00:07:47.75,00:07:47.75,met him. It was so nice to know that
82,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,"like, Joe was going to be here, and I was going to have, you"
83,00:07:52.33,00:07:52.33,"know, somebody that I knew I could go to with stuff."
84,00:07:55.25,00:07:55.25,"And then for that to not happen, I was so bummed."
85,00:07:58.25,00:07:58.25,"And I just like him, you know, like, he's a cool guy."
86,00:08:00.75,00:08:00.75,>> He's a cool guy. He's a real cool guy.
87,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,Stephen as well. Stephen's an awesome guy.
88,00:08:04.79,00:08:04.79,">> Yeah, I really like him. Well, I like all you guys."
89,00:08:07.38,00:08:07.38,"I'm like, ""How do I like your tribe more than I like my own?"""
90,00:08:11.08,00:08:11.08,>> Are you aligned with anyone here now?
91,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,">> Um, aligned, not so much. I've kind of stayed pretty"
92,00:08:17.33,00:08:17.33,"neutral, but, you know, regardless of who I'm talking"
93,00:08:20.92,00:08:20.92,"to or whatever, the only alliance I had in this game was"
94,00:08:23.08,00:08:23.08,"Joe, so... When you break it down, you've"
95,00:08:26.92,00:08:26.92,"got my original tribe, where we knew I was the first one out."
96,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,Then I have these new kids who are down in numbers and really
97,00:08:35.58,00:08:35.58,need a fourth. But no matter how the dice
98,00:08:38.50,00:08:38.50,"rolls, I've got some room to play around."
99,00:08:41.54,00:08:41.54,It's really nice. >> Things are in our favor
100,00:08:44.21,00:08:44.21,"right now. >> Yeah, because like I said,"
101,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,I like you guys more than I like my own tribe.
102,00:08:50.17,00:08:50.17,">> Erinn's vote would be huge, you know, because I lost Joe."
103,00:08:53.25,00:08:53.25,"He was a huge, solid vote. But now, Taj, myself, Stephen,"
104,00:08:58.25,00:08:58.25,and Erinn could easily turn the game around.
105,00:09:00.88,00:09:00.88,"So, it's good to know if I need her, I can call on her."
106,00:09:03.88,00:09:03.88,I know things are different from the time I got here.
107,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
108,00:09:25.58,00:09:25.58,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
109,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,>> Absolutely. >> Yeah.
110,00:09:28.71,00:09:28.71,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, you will be divided"
111,00:09:30.75,00:09:30.75,into teams of three. Each team will have one row of
112,00:09:34.25,00:09:34.25,"eight color-coded ceramic tiles. On my go, one member from each"
113,00:09:38.75,00:09:38.75,"team will toss a metal ball, attempting to knock out one of"
114,00:09:42.17,00:09:42.17,the tiles of the other two teams.
115,00:09:44.96,00:09:44.96,"When you're out of tiles, you're out of the challenge."
116,00:09:47.08,00:09:47.08,Last team left standing wins reward.
117,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,Want to know what you're playing for?
118,00:09:52.38,00:09:52.38,">> Oh, yeah. >> Yes."
119,00:09:53.83,00:09:53.83,>> PROBST: The winning threesome will be taken on an afternoon
120,00:09:56.08,00:09:56.08,of whitewater river rafting down the Rio Novo.
121,00:10:00.12,00:10:00.12,>> Yes! >> PROBST: This is world-class
122,00:10:03.21,00:10:03.21,"river rafting, an experience you will not soon forget."
123,00:10:06.71,00:10:06.71,"After the rafting trip, you will have a nice picnic,"
124,00:10:09.79,00:10:09.79,"sandwiches, chicken wings, brownies."
125,00:10:13.04,00:10:13.04,">> Brownies! >> Oh, my God!"

128,00:10:22.17,00:10:22.17,Island alone. A lot at stake.
129,00:10:26.04,00:10:26.04,You guys ready to get to it? >> Yep.
130,00:10:28.25,00:10:28.25,>> PROBST: We'll draw for teams and we'll get started.
131,00:10:33.21,00:10:33.21,"All right, we have our teams: Debbie, Brendan, J.T."

133,00:10:41.08,00:10:41.08,"Here we go. First shooters, head up."
134,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,"Your goal is to break the tile of one of the other teams, not"
135,00:10:47.17,00:10:47.17,your own. >> Stephen!
136,00:10:50.04,00:10:50.04,"Stephen, man, what are you doing?!"
137,00:10:51.79,00:10:51.79,>> PROBST: Stephen and Coach going for black.
138,00:10:54.04,00:10:54.04,"Debbie going for red. Here we go: three, two, one."

146,00:11:17.88,00:11:17.88,">> Your team is a little stacked, I think."
147,00:11:20.08,00:11:20.08,>> We're throwing underhand breaking tiles.
148,00:11:22.17,00:11:22.17,None of us have ever done this in our lives.
149,00:11:24.17,00:11:24.17,>> I have. >> Coach likes to have the
150,00:11:27.79,00:11:27.79,"attention. I mean, all the great stuff"
151,00:11:29.42,00:11:29.42,he's done. Sounds almost too good to be
152,00:11:31.75,00:11:31.75,true. >> PROBST: Here we go.
153,00:11:34.12,00:11:34.12,"Three, two, one, toss. Brendan breaks a white tile."
154,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,Sierra takes out a red tile Tyson gets nothing.

156,00:11:44.29,00:11:44.29,"White is down one tile. The more tiles you have, the"
157,00:11:47.17,00:11:47.17,better off you are. Brendan breaks a white tile.
158,00:11:58.96,00:11:58.96,J.T. with a long toss. Sierra's on fire!
159,00:12:01.04,00:12:01.04,"Connects, knocking out a white tile."
160,00:12:03.12,00:12:03.12,Tyson wipes out a white tile. >> Yeah!

162,00:12:09.04,00:12:09.04,"is now down to one tile left. Black team, white team, each"
163,00:12:12.50,00:12:12.50,have two tiles left. We are getting down to it.
164,00:12:16.46,00:12:16.46,Debbie going for white; Stephen and Coach going for black.

166,00:12:25.08,00:12:25.08,Stephen misses. Coach annihilates a black
167,00:12:28.25,00:12:28.25,tile. Black team now down with one
168,00:12:31.21,00:12:31.21,"tile left. The red team has one tile left,"
169,00:12:34.00,00:12:34.00,and the white team has two tiles left.
170,00:12:36.38,00:12:36.38,">> Finish the red off. And I'll miss, Erinn."

172,00:12:41.62,00:12:41.62,"to red?! Oh, okay."
173,00:12:43.00,00:12:43.00,">> All right, well, I'll get right (indistinct)"
174,00:12:45.58,00:12:45.58,">> Taj, come over there with white."
175,00:12:47.08,00:12:47.08,Go back to white with J.T. >> PROBST: Erinn is trying to

181,00:13:05.21,00:13:05.21,remaining red tile. The red team is now out of this
182,00:13:07.58,00:13:07.58,challenge. Sierra could put the black team
183,00:13:11.25,00:13:11.25,out of this and win it for the white team with one toss.
184,00:13:15.88,00:13:15.88,"Three, two, one, toss. >> Oh!"

188,00:13:28.96,00:13:28.96,"Erinn for the white team, J.T. for the black team."
189,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,"Three, two, one. Toss."
190,00:13:34.79,00:13:34.79,"Erinn goes deep, just too far. J.T. just too short."
191,00:13:39.08,00:13:39.08,">> Oh, I thought that was it, man."
192,00:13:42.46,00:13:42.46,"Deb, come on. >> PROBST: Debbie and Stephen,"
193,00:13:45.17,00:13:45.17,each looking to take out the last tile of the other team.
194,00:13:48.96,00:13:48.96,"Three, two, one, toss. Debbie, no chance."
195,00:13:53.17,00:13:53.17,"Stephen, no chance. Sierra and Brendan."
196,00:13:57.12,00:13:57.12,Brendan looking to win it for the black team.
197,00:13:59.25,00:13:59.25,"Three, two, one. Toss."
198,00:14:02.08,00:14:02.08,Oh! >> PROBST: Sierra short.
199,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,"Brendan clips it, but not enough."
200,00:14:06.08,00:14:06.08,"That white tile is clipped, but it is still standing."
201,00:14:09.67,00:14:09.67,">> Oh, man! >> PROBST: It still counts."
202,00:14:12.50,00:14:12.50,J.T. going to try to put the finishing touches on that white
203,00:14:14.71,00:14:14.71,tile. Erinn would like to win it for
204,00:14:16.71,00:14:16.71,"the white team. Three, two, one, toss."
205,00:14:21.83,00:14:21.83,>> PROBST: Erinn with a good toss.
206,00:14:24.08,00:14:24.08,">> Nope, it's not down. >> PROBST: Erinn knocks the"
207,00:14:26.71,00:14:26.71,"black tile, but it doesn't fall. It cannot get any closer than"
208,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,this. Both tiles have been broken.
209,00:14:32.79,00:14:32.79,Neither one of them has fallen through.
210,00:14:34.79,00:14:34.79,"Stephen, you may not even have to hit that tile."
211,00:14:36.58,00:14:36.58,You might just hit the wood. The vibration may knock it in.
212,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,">> Stephen, don't do nothing crazy now."
213,00:14:42.71,00:14:42.71,">> PROBST: Three, two, one, toss."
214,00:14:44.83,00:14:44.83,">> Oh, no! >> PROBST: Debbie too far,"
215,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,Stephen too short. Big reward on the line:
216,00:14:50.42,00:14:50.42,"whitewater river rafting, nice picnic, brownies, chicken"
217,00:14:54.08,00:14:54.08,"wings, sandwiches. >> Oh, my God, this is a"
218,00:14:57.12,00:14:57.12,nailbiter. >> PROBST: Here we go.
219,00:14:59.79,00:14:59.79,"Three, two, one, toss. Sierra short."
220,00:15:05.96,00:15:05.96,Brendan knocks out the final white tile.
221,00:15:08.54,00:15:08.54,"Black team wins reward. Black team, come on over."
222,00:15:17.29,00:15:17.29,"J.T., Debbie, Brendan, nice job. Before we send you on a nice"
223,00:15:21.96,00:15:21.96,"reward, you have a big decision to make."
224,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,Figure out which person you are sending to Exile Island.
225,00:15:26.25,00:15:26.25,They are going alone. They will not be choosing
226,00:15:28.04,00:15:28.04,anybody to go with them. >> Stephen.
227,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,">> PROBST: Stephen, grab your stuff."
228,00:15:34.12,00:15:34.12,">> Be the wizard, Stephen. Be the wizard."
229,00:15:38.79,00:15:38.79,">> PROBST: A map, even though you've been there before."
230,00:15:40.96,00:15:40.96,"Head back out the way you came. >> Sorry, Stephen."
231,00:15:42.75,00:15:42.75,">> Thanks, Jeff. No, it's my pleasure."
232,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,>> PROBST: Stephen will return in time for the next immunity
233,00:15:47.04,00:15:47.04,"challenge. All right, J.T., Brendan,"
234,00:15:49.83,00:15:49.83,"Debbie, nice reward. Whitewater river rafting,"
235,00:15:53.88,00:15:53.88,nice afternoon picnic. It will be a nice little break.
236,00:15:56.08,00:15:56.08,You will head back to camp and go on your reward tomorrow.
237,00:15:58.12,00:15:58.12,"Got it. >> PROBST: All right, guys,"
238,00:16:00.54,00:16:00.54,"sadly, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff and head back"
239,00:16:02.50,00:16:02.50,"to camp. >> Thanks, Jeff."
240,00:16:04.38,00:16:04.38,">> PROBST: Coach, you can, uh, leave that behind."
241,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,>> I'm sorry. I'm so pissed off right now.
242,00:16:07.83,00:16:07.83,>> I'm sorry. >> I wanted to get on that river
243,00:16:10.29,00:16:10.29,in some type of raft or kayak since I got here.
244,00:16:16.00,00:16:16.00,">> I mean, I expect Brendan trying to scheme."
245,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,"I'm not really that worried, Brendan being gone with J.T."
246,00:16:21.17,00:16:21.17,and Debbie. Those are two of the strongest
247,00:16:22.54,00:16:22.54,"allies. So, it actually worked out well."
248,00:16:25.71,00:16:25.71,I just hope the extra food Brendan gets isn't going to
249,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,hurt our chances for winning immunity.
250,00:16:39.96,00:16:39.96,">> Clue six: ""A big wooden head is what you have here."
251,00:16:43.21,00:16:43.21,"Look in the gap that you'll find in the rear."""
252,00:16:46.58,00:16:46.58,No surprise here. Great.
253,00:16:48.79,00:16:48.79,This is my first Exile out here alone.
254,00:16:50.96,00:16:50.96,"It's the first of anybody's Exiles out here alone, and I got"
255,00:16:53.33,00:16:53.33,the new clue to the same idols that we know about.
256,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,"So, I know there's no new idol in the game."
257,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,I'm definitely concerned about being on Exile.
258,00:17:08.21,00:17:08.21,I haven't made fire yet at camp. I tried a few times and I
259,00:17:11.54,00:17:11.54,"failed, and I was so embarrassed I hadn't tried"
260,00:17:13.88,00:17:13.88,"again. So, I knew that by forcing"
261,00:17:17.17,00:17:17.17,"myself to come out here, either I would make fire, make food,"
262,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,or I would die. It looked like I might die.
263,00:17:31.83,00:17:31.83,"I was trying for about an hour or two to make fire, just"
264,00:17:36.38,00:17:36.38,smacking that flint over and over again with a machete.
265,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,And nothing. How about that!
266,00:17:48.62,00:17:48.62,"Damn, I can build a fire! How about that!"
267,00:17:52.04,00:17:52.04,"Finally, as darkness was starting to close around me,"
268,00:17:55.04,00:17:55.04,I got a spark; it caught; and the whole thing took.
269,00:17:59.04,00:17:59.04,It was like giving birth to my first child.
270,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,I felt so proud of that little fire that I just wanted to stay
271,00:18:03.88,00:18:03.88,out here and tend to it for the rest of my life.
272,00:18:07.54,00:18:07.54,"So, even though I missed out on that good lunch and a fun,"
273,00:18:10.50,00:18:10.50,"relaxing, water rafting trip, being out here and making it"
274,00:18:14.04,00:18:14.04,"is like winning my own reward. >> Brendan, myself, and Debbie"
275,00:18:42.29,00:18:42.29,"went to the reward, and we had a blast."
276,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,I've actually never been able to go whitewater rafting and
277,00:18:47.46,00:18:47.46,that's something I've always wanted to do forever.
278,00:18:50.42,00:18:50.42,I felt just like a little kid. >> A-ha!
279,00:18:56.12,00:18:56.12,>> Yeah! >> Great job!
280,00:19:03.12,00:19:03.12,>> The reward was so much fun. The pure joy that was on J.T.'s
281,00:19:07.54,00:19:07.54,face to see how much he just soaks it up and appreciates it.
282,00:19:11.46,00:19:11.46,"What a great soul. So sincere, so real."
283,00:19:14.17,00:19:14.17,"Like, all qualities that you want in people that surround"
284,00:19:18.04,00:19:18.04,you or at least I do. >> Forza!
285,00:19:25.46,00:19:25.46,">> After we did, like, the best rafting ever, we came along"
286,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,this huge sandbar and I knew it was our picnic.
287,00:19:32.12,00:19:32.12,>> This is amazing! I've died and gone to heaven.
288,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,Chips! There's chips!
289,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,"Oh, my God! Look at those brownies!"
290,00:19:40.92,00:19:40.92,"Whoo! Oh, my God."
291,00:19:44.12,00:19:44.12,This is the best food in the world.
292,00:19:47.21,00:19:47.21,">> Oh, my God! I had a really good day."
293,00:19:52.12,00:19:52.12,"I mean, it was a lot better than I had pictured."
294,00:19:53.79,00:19:53.79,I figured Brendan and I being together would kind of be a
295,00:19:56.54,00:19:56.54,"dull trip, but there wasn't a dull moment at all."
296,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,>> No? >> About what?
297,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,">> Just about how to, you know. >> Keep me in the game a little"
298,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,longer. >> Have some fun.
299,00:20:15.04,00:20:15.04,">> If there's an opportunity, I damn sure will do what I can"
300,00:20:17.12,00:20:17.12,"do, whatever I can. >> All right, yeah."
301,00:20:20.08,00:20:20.08,I always kind of define winning in a lot of my life of saying
302,00:20:22.50,00:20:22.50,"like, I'm going to be #1. If I take J.T. in the finals"
303,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,"with me, he's going to beat me. I know it's crazy, but for me,"
304,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,winning in this game is about getting to an outcome at the
305,00:20:31.67,00:20:31.67,end of the game which is going to satisfy me.
306,00:20:35.46,00:20:35.46,"If he wins it, that's like me winning this game."
307,00:20:38.67,00:20:38.67,How do I get him to the finals? I don't know.
308,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,That's the next step I need to wrap my head around.
309,00:20:43.50,00:20:43.50,"Let's have some fun. >> I'm definitely up for it,"
310,00:20:45.46,00:20:45.46,man. >> I stayed up all night.
311,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,"I sat in that shelter and did not sleep at all, just running"
312,00:21:06.38,00:21:06.38,through all the different scenarios about how do I get
313,00:21:08.33,00:21:08.33,"J.T. to the finals. And at a certain point, all the"
314,00:21:11.58,00:21:11.58,"pieces, like, just fell and you could see the puzzle and how it"
315,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,needs to be put together.  >> Here's how we're gonna do
316,00:21:21.67,00:21:21.67,"it.  Um, I don't think we should send"
317,00:21:24.12,00:21:24.12,J.T. home. We had the awesome time.
318,00:21:30.96,00:21:30.96,He's such a good dude. Debbie had such a good time
319,00:21:33.25,00:21:33.25,with him. >> He is.
320,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,He's one of the most amazing people I have ever met in my
321,00:21:36.92,00:21:36.92,life. >> I think what we should do is
322,00:21:39.00,00:21:39.00,"you, me, Taj, Stephen, J.T., take out Tyson, Coach, and"
323,00:21:46.42,00:21:46.42,Erinn. Start taking them out.
324,00:21:50.33,00:21:50.33,">> This morning, Brendan is like, ""All right, here's what's"
325,00:21:52.25,00:21:52.25,going on. I really like J.T.
326,00:21:54.17,00:21:54.17,"I think J.T. deserves to be here,"" and I feel the same way."
327,00:21:56.50,00:21:56.50,"Like, I really respect J.T. So, we're going to try to get"
328,00:21:58.88,00:21:58.88,"Coach and Tyson. >> Okay, so, I know how to do"
329,00:22:07.54,00:22:07.54,it. >> Change it?
330,00:22:14.67,00:22:14.67,"How? >> You, me, Stephen, J.T.,"
331,00:22:18.62,00:22:18.62,and Sierra... >> Okay.
332,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,"Okay, okay. >> And, Taj?"
333,00:22:26.54,00:22:26.54,>> Yes? >> We haven't talked...
334,00:22:28.29,00:22:28.29,">> I know, we haven't had a chance to."
335,00:22:30.21,00:22:30.21,">> That's got to make you uncomfortable, but you, like,"
336,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,you gotta trust me. >> I can't describe Timbira.
337,00:22:37.33,00:22:37.33,I really want to know what that word stands for because it
338,00:22:39.42,00:22:39.42,"could mean ""confused."" Coach and Tyson want to"
339,00:22:42.25,00:22:42.25,"blindside Brendan, and, um, Brendan is trying it vote out"
340,00:22:46.33,00:22:46.33,Tyson or Coach. We haven't even had to really
341,00:22:49.25,00:22:49.25,put any plans into action yet because they're so busy trying
342,00:22:51.79,00:22:51.79,to get out their own tribe members right now.
343,00:22:53.42,00:22:53.42,"We're like, ""Okay, do what you gotta do and we'll come in"
344,00:22:55.79,00:22:55.79,"later."" >> Sierra knows the plan."
345,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,"Yesterday, on the river trip, I talked to J.T. and I was like"
346,00:23:01.62,00:23:01.62,"""J.T., I think I can save you."" He's such a good dude."
347,00:23:05.50,00:23:05.50,">> I know, he is. I love him to death, and I"
348,00:23:07.83,00:23:07.83,"don't want him to go. >> No, I agree. I agree."
349,00:23:15.04,00:23:15.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Stephen,"
350,00:23:24.96,00:23:24.96,"returning from Exile Island. >> Welcome back, buddy."
351,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,>> PROBST: You were out there for a while on Exile this time.
352,00:23:37.83,00:23:37.83,">> It was a couple of days alone, yeah, but actually, not"
353,00:23:39.92,00:23:39.92,that bad. The weather was pretty good.
354,00:23:41.67,00:23:41.67,"I had big fires both nights. I didn't get much sleep, but it"
355,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,"was, you know, it was all right. >> PROBST: You guys ready to"
356,00:23:47.58,00:23:47.58,get to today's challenge? >> Let's do it.
357,00:23:49.08,00:23:49.08,">> PROBST: First things first. Tyson, hand back the necklace."
358,00:23:51.75,00:23:51.75,>> It's too gaudy for me anyway. >> PROBST: Does that mean you
359,00:23:56.79,00:23:56.79,"don't want it again? >> Oh, I'll probably wear it"
360,00:23:58.33,00:23:58.33,again. >> PROBST: All right.
361,00:24:00.79,00:24:00.79,"For today's challenge, you will each be attached to a long rope"
362,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,that is threaded through a series of obstacles.
363,00:24:06.88,00:24:06.88,"You'll climb over, crawl under, maneuver around these obstacles"
364,00:24:10.71,00:24:10.71,as you race to the finish. First three to finish move on
365,00:24:14.08,00:24:14.08,"to the final round, where, once again, you will be attached to"
366,00:24:17.08,00:24:17.08,"one long rope, only this time, the obstacle is three levels"
367,00:24:21.00,00:24:21.00,high. It will seriously complicate
368,00:24:23.00,00:24:23.00,things. First person to finish wins
369,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,"immunity, guaranteed a one-in-eight shot"
370,00:24:30.25,00:24:30.25,"at winning this game. Losers, Tribal Council, where"
371,00:24:33.83,00:24:33.83,somebody will be going home. We'll draw for spots and get
372,00:24:36.08,00:24:36.08,started. Here we go.
373,00:24:41.08,00:24:41.08,"For immunity, survivors ready? Go!"
374,00:24:47.21,00:24:47.21,There is a learning curve to this challenge.
375,00:24:51.12,00:24:51.12,Things that will help make getting around this rope a
376,00:24:53.25,00:24:53.25,"little easier, but there are no shortcuts."
377,00:24:59.92,00:24:59.92,J.T. off to a quick start. Tyson off to a quick start.
378,00:25:06.75,00:25:06.75,"Debbie, J.T., Tyson, all doing very well."
379,00:25:12.00,00:25:12.00,Coach flying through the course. Brendan right in there.
380,00:25:16.58,00:25:16.58,"Sierra hanging in there. Taj struggling, in dead last."
381,00:25:23.21,00:25:23.21,Stephen not doing a lot better. Erinn right in there.
382,00:25:27.38,00:25:27.38,It's Tyson and J.T. battling it out right now.
383,00:25:31.88,00:25:31.88,"Sierra's now through. It's Tyson, J.T., and Sierra."
384,00:25:37.67,00:25:37.67,"Brendan's through. Coach frustrated, stuck."
385,00:25:42.92,00:25:42.92,Nothing prepared him for the rope-a-dope.
386,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,"Tyson and J.T., neck and neck. Erinn now moving on to the next"
387,00:25:51.17,00:25:51.17,obstacle. Tyson has finished the second
388,00:25:53.62,00:25:53.62,"obstacle. Tyson now on the last obstacle,"
389,00:25:56.08,00:25:56.08,J.T. right behind him. Tyson and J.T. in very good
390,00:26:00.75,00:26:00.75,shape. Three people are moving on to
391,00:26:03.17,00:26:03.17,the final. The other six will have no shot
392,00:26:06.21,00:26:06.21,at immunity. J.T. throwing himself over this
393,00:26:09.79,00:26:09.79,challenge. Brendan now on to the last
394,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,"obstacle. It is Tyson, J.T., and Brendan."
395,00:26:18.33,00:26:18.33,Sierra now is in it. Four people fighting for three
396,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,spots. Taj and Stephen still back on
397,00:26:25.12,00:26:25.12,the first obstacle. J.T. very close.
398,00:26:28.54,00:26:28.54,Tyson very close. It's going to come down to
399,00:26:30.75,00:26:30.75,Brendan and Sierra for that final spot.
400,00:26:33.29,00:26:33.29,Brendan with a bit of a lead over Sierra.
401,00:26:35.79,00:26:35.79,J.T. is across first. J.T. moving on to the final.
402,00:26:41.38,00:26:41.38,Tyson is across. Tyson moving on to the final.

404,00:26:54.08,00:26:54.08,Brendan losing his shoes. Brendan moves on to the final!
405,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,"Tyson, J.T., and Brendan, moving on to the final."
406,00:27:09.46,00:27:09.46,"Here we go, for immunity. Tyson, J.T., Brendan."
407,00:27:13.21,00:27:13.21,Survivors ready? Go!
408,00:27:16.62,00:27:16.62,First round was very close. Only one will win immunity.
409,00:27:22.21,00:27:22.21,A lot of bodies being launched. Tyson off to an early lead.
410,00:27:28.29,00:27:28.29,J.T. is right behind him. Cannot fall behind in this
411,00:27:32.50,00:27:32.50,challenge. Tyson and J.T. very close.
412,00:27:47.67,00:27:47.67,Brendan right in there. Brendan now in the lead.
413,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,">> Keep going, J.T.! >> PROBST: Brendan still with a"
414,00:28:00.12,00:28:00.12,lead over J.T. and Tyson. Tyson making up some ground now.
415,00:28:10.62,00:28:10.62,Getting down to it. It is Brendan and Tyson.
416,00:28:12.50,00:28:12.50,"J.T. has fallen out of it. On the last part of this course,"
417,00:28:23.67,00:28:23.67,Tyson now with the lead. >> Tyson!
418,00:28:26.04,00:28:26.04,>> PROBST: Tyson flying through this.
419,00:28:28.17,00:28:28.17,"Tyson wins immunity! >> Oh, my God!"
420,00:28:36.00,00:28:36.00,>> Tyson saved the day ensuring that Brendan would go home 
421,00:28:38.38,00:28:38.38,tonight. In case he plays the immunity
422,00:28:40.25,00:28:40.25,"idol, we're gonna split the votes, four for Brendan,"
423,00:28:42.04,00:28:42.04,three for Sierra. Brendan is the dragon.
424,00:28:44.42,00:28:44.42,I'm the dragonslayer. This is gonna be the biggest
425,00:28:47.04,00:28:47.04,"power move to date of this game, no question about it."
426,00:28:49.83,00:28:49.83,">> PROBST: Tyson, come on over. >> Tyson!"
427,00:28:54.21,00:28:54.21,">> PROBST: As he predicted, for the second time, Tyson has"
428,00:28:59.04,00:28:59.04,immunity once again. Tyson's safe at Tribal Council.
429,00:29:02.83,00:29:02.83,Not the same for the rest of you.
430,00:29:04.62,00:29:04.62,One of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff.
431,00:29:06.25,00:29:06.25,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
432,00:29:08.42,00:29:08.42,>> Tyson won the immunity. We can't vote Tyson.
433,00:29:10.42,00:29:10.42,"So, I decided on Coach. It will be nice to have him out"
434,00:29:13.29,00:29:13.29,"of here, I think. >> Congratulations."
435,00:29:34.38,00:29:34.38,">> Thanks, dude. You were awesome."
436,00:29:36.04,00:29:36.04,">> Seriously, it was a delight watching you."
437,00:29:38.33,00:29:38.33,"It was like something out of... >> Dude, you need a hug, man."
438,00:29:41.71,00:29:41.71,>> You need a hug. >> You got your fire started.
439,00:29:45.25,00:29:45.25,">> I got my fire started. >> Oh, you were so worried."
440,00:29:47.33,00:29:47.33,>> Unfortunately I spent like an hour just chopping at that flint
441,00:29:49.83,00:29:49.83,"and I made it and it was like, it was actually one of the best"
442,00:29:52.79,00:29:52.79,moments of my life. >> Oh!
443,00:29:55.21,00:29:55.21,">> For me, it was a big step. >> I'm very proud of you."
444,00:30:00.00,00:30:00.00,>> We missed your poetry yesterday.
445,00:30:02.67,00:30:02.67,I feel like I have no skills at all.
446,00:30:04.54,00:30:04.54,>> You know what I did? >> I started this plan to
447,00:30:16.04,00:30:16.04,"eliminate Brendan days ago, but due to default, we didn't"
448,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,even go to Tribal. I've already got it set up so
449,00:30:22.62,00:30:22.62,"four votes go to Brendan, three votes go to Sierra."
450,00:30:25.12,00:30:25.12,"If Brendan gets wind of it and uses his idol, Sierra is gone."
451,00:30:28.96,00:30:28.96,Brendan's gone in three days from that.
452,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,I'd like to see him go first because I'd like three days of
453,00:30:33.46,00:30:33.46,just bossing her around and telling her to shut up.
454,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,"Probably won't win me her vote from the jury, but it would"
455,00:30:40.71,00:30:40.71,"probably win me everybody else's vote, so... so it would be a"
456,00:30:44.79,00:30:44.79,win-win for me. >> What is it?
457,00:30:52.42,00:30:52.42,">> Water. >> All right, can we just sit"
458,00:30:54.67,00:30:54.67,down real quick? >> Yeah.
459,00:30:56.29,00:30:56.29,>> The Exile alliance hibernated for a while.
460,00:30:59.58,00:30:59.58,"Uh, it's finally going to rear its ugly head."
461,00:31:01.88,00:31:01.88,>> I talked to Taj this morning. I think we go after Coach.
462,00:31:05.92,00:31:05.92,"We get us four and Taj, I had an extensive conversation with"
463,00:31:12.08,00:31:12.08,Taj this morning about it. >> Okay.
464,00:31:16.17,00:31:16.17,>> You guys cool? >> Yeah.
465,00:31:17.46,00:31:17.46,">> Oh, yeah. >> Okay."
466,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,">> Myself, Sierra, Taj, Stephen, and now J.T. are all voting"
467,00:31:24.17,00:31:24.17,Coach. I think that this will be one
468,00:31:27.25,00:31:27.25,of the biggest blindsides so far in the game.
469,00:31:30.12,00:31:30.12,"Um, so, I guess I'm happy to be a part of on the good side."
470,00:31:45.71,00:31:45.71,">> I thought you might. Wow, that changes everything."
471,00:31:50.79,00:31:50.79,>> He said he wants me in the finals.
472,00:31:52.58,00:31:52.58,>> Why would he want that? >> He likes me a lot.
473,00:31:57.08,00:31:57.08,>> But that's crazy. >> I know.
474,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,>> It would be a really strong play.
475,00:32:01.00,00:32:01.00,We might have to seriously think about it.
476,00:32:06.21,00:32:06.21,">> You know what, he's crazy. He is somewhat crazy."
477,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,"I think that story about him being captured on the Amazon,"
478,00:32:13.50,00:32:13.50,that's just hard to believe. >> That is pretty hard to
479,00:32:15.33,00:32:15.33,"believe. >> I mean, (indistinct) I mean,"
480,00:32:20.46,00:32:20.46,"I wouldn't reckon with them son of a bitches, don't you think?"
481,00:32:25.08,00:32:25.08,I would have come back with a damn .30-.30 Winchester.
482,00:32:28.33,00:32:28.33,"Something, you know what I mean? >> I would definitely say we're"
483,00:32:38.08,00:32:38.08,"in control of this game now. >> It's a big difference, you"
484,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,know? Jalapao came into the merge
485,00:32:42.92,00:32:42.92,"down in numbers, but before the first Tribal Council we come to,"
486,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,I'm the deciding factor. It's huge.
487,00:32:48.92,00:32:48.92,I can go with Brendan right now and get rid of Coach or I can
488,00:32:51.25,00:32:51.25,go with Coach and Tyson and get rid of Brendan.
489,00:32:53.38,00:32:53.38,It's completely in my court. >> Clean pots and water.
490,00:33:00.50,00:33:00.50,>> Clean pots and water? >> Yeah.
491,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,>> I'm looking forward to Tribal.
492,00:33:04.21,00:33:04.21,"The old Timbira is going to go after J.T., but I'm going to"
493,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,take out Coach. >> Sierra's got that pot...
494,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,>> She does? >> I don't like misleading
495,00:33:13.12,00:33:13.12,"people, but I feel like this is the one time in life that you're"
496,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,actually allowed to do it and you get a get-out-of-jail-free
497,00:33:18.25,00:33:18.25,pass. >> I'm down with that.
498,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,>> Okay. >> Tyson.
499,00:33:30.29,00:33:30.29,>> J.T.? >> Yeah.
500,00:33:36.88,00:33:36.88,>> Just pass it around. >> Okay.
501,00:33:38.62,00:33:38.62,">> Pass it around, make sure everybody knows."
502,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,Everybody already pretty much knows.
503,00:33:42.29,00:33:42.29,">> Sierra, you good? >> Yeah."
504,00:33:44.29,00:33:44.29,Done. >> Done and done?
505,00:33:48.92,00:33:48.92,"Okay. Yeah, okay, cool."
506,00:33:53.21,00:33:53.21,">> Brendan suspects nothing. In fact, Brendan still thinks"
507,00:33:55.46,00:33:55.46,"we're going to vote J.T. off. But in reality, we're cutting"
508,00:33:58.71,00:33:58.71,"the head off the dragon and sending Brendan home, and I"
509,00:34:01.62,00:34:01.62,"feel very happy about that. You know, leaders are born."
510,00:34:04.92,00:34:04.92,"I'm not saying Brendan is not a naturally born leader, but when"
511,00:34:07.58,00:34:07.58,"it comes head-to-head, we'll see tonight who really was the"
512,00:34:10.96,00:34:10.96,Chosen One. It's going to be Coach way.
513,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,"So, that's very fulfilling. >> PROBST: So, you guys have "
514,00:34:35.75,00:34:35.75,spent a little bit of time together as one tribe.
515,00:34:37.92,00:34:37.92,"Erinn, I'm guessing certain roles are emerging."
516,00:34:41.12,00:34:41.12,Who's the person that keeps the tribe laughing?
517,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,>> Tyson. He just always has some sort of
518,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,"offhanded, witty comment to make."
519,00:34:49.58,00:34:49.58,"He's kind of the class clown. >> PROBST: J.T., who tells the"
520,00:34:52.08,00:34:52.08,"best campfire stories? >> Uh, Coach probably tells the"
521,00:34:55.25,00:34:55.25,"best campfire stories, no doubt. >> PROBST: Taj, what's the best"
522,00:34:58.62,00:34:58.62,"story Coach has told? >> Well, I love the Amazon story"
523,00:35:01.71,00:35:01.71,because he told us about how he was captured by this tribe and
524,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,"he was beaten and he escapes and he's, like, paddling for two"
525,00:35:08.21,00:35:08.21,days down the Amazon River to get away.
526,00:35:10.83,00:35:10.83,It's so unbelievable. It was incredible.
527,00:35:13.08,00:35:13.08,">> PROBST: Coach, this really happened or this is a movie"
528,00:35:15.17,00:35:15.17,version of what you want to have happened?
529,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,">> I tried to actually tone it down because if I tell them,"
530,00:35:20.33,00:35:20.33,"you know, that the tribe was, you know, looking at my ass,"
531,00:35:24.46,00:35:24.46,"talking about eating my ass, so, actually, you know, when I"
532,00:35:26.96,00:35:26.96,"tell these stories, I usually try to give like the ""PG-13"""
533,00:35:30.17,00:35:30.17,"version of it. >> PROBST: Coach, does it bother"
534,00:35:32.38,00:35:32.38,you that some people might question these stories?
535,00:35:34.96,00:35:34.96,">> What I've been through in my life, it's pretty fantastic."
536,00:35:37.88,00:35:37.88,"I got, you know, scars all over my body that I can point to,"
537,00:35:40.96,00:35:40.96,"of the, you know, five, six, seven, eight, life or"
538,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,death situations I've been through.
539,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,"PROBST: Five, six, seven, or eight life-or-death situations?"
540,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,">> Probably more than that, I mean, if you want me to recount"
541,00:35:49.54,00:35:49.54,them I will. I've been through a hurricane.
542,00:35:51.21,00:35:51.21,"I've been attacked by a shark, had a run-in with a"
543,00:35:53.54,00:35:53.54,"crocodile, got captured by the Indian tribe; I mean, there were"
544,00:35:55.71,00:35:55.71,some very defining moments in my life where I thought these
545,00:36:00.21,00:36:00.21,were the last three or four seconds.
546,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,"So, it doesn't bother me that people wanna question that."
547,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,They cannot question my integrity and my honesty.
548,00:36:07.67,00:36:07.67,That's how I'm playing this game.
549,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,"That's how I play my life. >> PROBST: From the beginning,"
550,00:36:12.42,00:36:12.42,"Coach, you've talked about the numbers, sticking together,"
551,00:36:15.42,00:36:15.42,having a strong group. Still feel confident about that?
552,00:36:18.21,00:36:18.21,>> I do feel confident about tonight's vote.
553,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,">> PROBST: Tyson, how big is trust in tonight's vote? "
554,00:36:23.21,00:36:23.21,">> If one of the Jalapao members goes home, then I"
555,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,"think that Timbiras stayed loyal, and if for some reason a"
556,00:36:29.08,00:36:29.08,"Timbira tribe member does go home, I think everybody will"
557,00:36:32.00,00:36:32.00,"seriously rethink, uh, their strategies."
558,00:36:34.67,00:36:34.67,">> PROBST: Stephen, how does that sit with you? "
559,00:36:36.96,00:36:36.96,"What can you do, if anything, to change your fate?"
560,00:36:39.38,00:36:39.38,">> You know, in my case, I'm just hoping I have enough time"
561,00:36:42.33,00:36:42.33,to get to know more people. I'm really glad that J.T. is
562,00:36:46.83,00:36:46.83,over there with a much larger target on his back than I
563,00:36:49.33,00:36:49.33,"have on mine. >> PROBST: Taj, do you think"
564,00:36:51.38,00:36:51.38,that's true? The people that are the most
565,00:36:53.38,00:36:53.38,physically threatening at challenges are now gonna be
566,00:36:56.00,00:36:56.00,"the biggest targets? >> Yeah, I definitely think so."
567,00:36:58.54,00:36:58.54,"I mean, J.T. is fast. He's a lovable person."
568,00:37:01.71,00:37:01.71,He's like a triple threat because you just can't find
569,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,"anything wrong with him. >> PROBST: Coach, you agree"
570,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00,with that? If you're a physical threat in
571,00:37:08.50,00:37:08.50,"this game, it's time for you to go?"
572,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,>> The seven layers of heaven with the Vikings were
573,00:37:12.46,00:37:12.46,determined on how they were defeated in battle.
574,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,I want to surround myself with warriors.
575,00:37:17.75,00:37:17.75,">> PROBST: So, Brendan... >> Even if that means that they"
576,00:37:20.42,00:37:20.42,"defeat me, I think that that's the honorable way to play this"
577,00:37:23.75,00:37:23.75,"game. >> PROBST: Brendan, biggest"
578,00:37:26.62,00:37:26.62,physical threats going to be the first to go?
579,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,">> It's natural to kind of want to go after the strong, but just"
580,00:37:31.67,00:37:31.67,because you're strong doesn't mean you go deep in this game.
581,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,">> PROBST: Tyson, has there been much talk about the idol and"
582,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"that it's hidden, meaning somebody might have it and"
583,00:37:40.17,00:37:40.17,nobody knows? >> I just assumed that everybody
584,00:37:42.54,00:37:42.54,that's been to Exile could possibly have the idol.
585,00:37:45.54,00:37:45.54,"And if I figure out who has it then great; if not, everybody"
586,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"who's been there has it. >> PROBST: Taj, how does that"
587,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,make you feel? You've been to Exile.
588,00:37:51.88,00:37:51.88,">> I don't have it. >> PROBST: Erinn, do you have"
589,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,it? >> I don't have it.
590,00:37:55.83,00:37:55.83,">> PROBST: Stephen, do you have  it?"
591,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,">> No. >> Brendan, do you have it?"
592,00:37:59.04,00:37:59.04,>> I have it. >> PROBST: Brendan has it.
593,00:38:02.38,00:38:02.38,"All right, at least we've cleared that up."
594,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,You guys ready to get to the vote?
595,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,Tyson has the individual immunity idol.
596,00:38:09.12,00:38:09.12,I take it you're keeping it for yourself?
597,00:38:11.21,00:38:11.21,"All right, cannot vote for Tyson."
598,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
599,00:38:15.67,00:38:15.67,"J.T., you're up. >> The ancient samurai used to"
600,00:38:34.04,00:38:34.04,"say that if you wanted to win the war, you had to cut off the"
601,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,"head of the dragon. You, my friend, are the dragon,"
602,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,and I am the dragonslayer. >> This is my wizard lightning
603,00:39:19.12,00:39:19.12,shooting you back home. Ga-bow!
604,00:39:30.54,00:39:30.54,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
605,00:39:41.17,00:39:41.17,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
606,00:39:43.04,00:39:43.04,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
607,00:39:51.50,00:39:51.50,"Okay. Once the votes are read,"
608,00:39:53.25,00:39:53.25,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
609,00:39:55.21,00:39:55.21,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
610,00:39:56.83,00:39:56.83,I'll read the votes. First vote: Coach.
611,00:40:09.50,00:40:09.50,Coach. Two votes Coach.

615,00:40:30.04,00:40:30.04,Brendan. That's three votes Brendan;
616,00:40:33.04,00:40:33.04,two votes Coach. Sierra.
617,00:40:40.96,00:40:40.96,That's three votes Brendan; two votes Coach;
618,00:40:43.25,00:40:43.25,one vote Sierra. Sierra.
619,00:40:49.21,00:40:49.21,Three votes Brendan; two votes Coach;
620,00:40:51.29,00:40:51.29,two votes Sierra. We're tied.

623,00:41:08.62,00:41:08.62,"Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins, and the"
624,00:41:11.12,00:41:11.12,first member of our jury: Brendan.
625,00:41:17.25,00:41:17.25,"You need to bring me your torch. Brendan, the tribe has spoken."
626,00:41:30.75,00:41:30.75,">> Good luck, fellas. >> PROBST: Well, judging by the "
627,00:41:47.38,00:41:47.38,"amount of smiles, I'd say that was a pretty good blindside."
628,00:41:50.96,00:41:50.96,So much for old tribal loyalties.
629,00:41:53.08,00:41:53.08,This is clearly an individual game.
630,00:41:55.46,00:41:55.46,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

635,00:42:12.08,00:42:12.08,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time
636,00:42:19.00,00:42:19.00,on Survivor: >> You're going to be the next
637,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,to go. >> PROBST: Sierra fights for her
638,00:42:21.88,00:42:21.88,life. >> I'm trying to explain my
639,00:42:24.38,00:42:24.38,side so it doesn't look like I was the mastermind.
640,00:42:26.71,00:42:26.71,>> I don't think you were the mastermind.
641,00:42:28.04,00:42:28.04,I don't think you're smart enough for it.
642,00:42:29.92,00:42:29.92,>> PROBST: Can she save herself? >> You made your bed.
643,00:42:32.12,00:42:32.12,It kills me to have this kid here asking me to throw her a
644,00:42:34.71,00:42:34.71,bone. It breaks my heart.
645,00:42:42.46,00:42:42.46,>> I knew at the merge that what would happen is I'd
646,00:42:45.00,00:42:45.00,become a big target. I didn't think it'd happen
647,00:42:47.00,00:42:47.00,"quite that quickly, um, but it kind of feels good to "
648,00:42:50.00,00:42:50.00,"blindside because I wanted to blindside someone, too."
649,00:42:52.21,00:42:52.21,That's all part of the game. The thing that Sierra probably
650,00:42:54.29,00:42:54.29,needs most is in my pocket right now: the hidden immunity idol.
651,00:42:57.54,00:42:57.54,"But it doesn't matter. She'd be next, regardless, to"
652,00:42:59.54,00:42:59.54,go. It's just a matter of time.
