2,00:00:02.83,00:00:02.83,"on Survivor: At Lopevi, the tribe had enough"
3,00:00:07.08,00:00:07.08,of John's lazy attitude. >> He's the kind of person that
4,00:00:10.21,00:00:10.21,"coasts through the game. >> Yeah, he is."
5,00:00:12.00,00:00:12.00,>> He's not coasting through this game with us.
6,00:00:13.96,00:00:13.96,">> No. >> At Yasur, Rory attempted"
7,00:00:16.71,00:00:16.71,to break into Ami and Leann's alliance.
8,00:00:19.12,00:00:19.12,>> I need to know where you guys stand with regards to me.
9,00:00:21.25,00:00:21.25,>> What happens when the merger comes with the men?
10,00:00:23.08,00:00:23.08,>> I don't give a ... about them men.
11,00:00:24.79,00:00:24.79,I know you guys a lot better than I know them.
12,00:00:26.42,00:00:26.42,">> Unfortunately for you, the fact that the women had this"
13,00:00:28.21,00:00:28.21,"alliance excludes you. >> At the reward challenge,"
14,00:00:33.67,00:00:33.67,Lopevi got an unexpected surprise.
15,00:00:35.42,00:00:35.42,Lisa voted out at the last Tribal Council.
16,00:00:37.54,00:00:37.54,">> I thought for sure that they would have gotten rid of him,"
17,00:00:40.71,00:00:40.71,"keep the women together. >> PROBST: Survivors ready, go!"
18,00:00:44.08,00:00:44.08,After a nerve-wracking challenge that tested the survivors'
19,00:00:47.17,00:00:47.17,"steadiness, it was Yasur that walked away with victory."
20,00:00:50.08,00:00:50.08,Yasur wins Home Cafe reward. And a little taste of home.
21,00:00:54.67,00:00:54.67,">> Whoa! >> Guys, look, pictures."
22,00:00:56.29,00:00:56.29,Me and my sisters. >> Oh.
23,00:00:57.67,00:00:57.67,>> This is our first Halloween together.
24,00:00:59.79,00:00:59.79,>> Oh. >> Oh.
25,00:01:00.38,00:01:00.38,">> Coffee, croissants, and we got letters from home."
26,00:01:03.62,00:01:03.62,>> To love and to family. >> PROBST: Though emotions
27,00:01:05.71,00:01:05.71,brought the tribe together... >> I'm really happy right now.
28,00:01:07.92,00:01:07.92,>> PROBST: ...Rory kept his guard up.
29,00:01:09.12,00:01:09.12,">> Even though this is a loving moment, and we're"
30,00:01:11.46,00:01:11.46,"bonding, I ain't forgot where they put me."
31,00:01:13.17,00:01:13.17,>> PROBST: At Lopevi... >> Would you like to join me?
32,00:01:15.92,00:01:15.92,>> PROBST: ...Twila and Julie plotted to stick together and
33,00:01:18.42,00:01:18.42,keep their options open. >> I don't have any
34,00:01:20.67,00:01:20.67,"loyalties to the women. >> I don't, either."
35,00:01:22.75,00:01:22.75,>> I just think the guys are gonna shaft us whenever they
36,00:01:25.08,00:01:25.08,"get a chance, but little do they know..."
37,00:01:27.04,00:01:27.04,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Rory knew he had to"
38,00:01:29.88,00:01:29.88,"come through, and he did, sparing himself and his tribe"
39,00:01:32.71,00:01:32.71,mates a trip to Tribal Council. >> Yeah.
40,00:01:35.12,00:01:35.12,>> PROBST: Yasur wins immunity! ( cheering )
41,00:01:38.04,00:01:38.04,">> Whoa. Whoa! >> PROBST: Back at camp, there"
42,00:01:40.21,00:01:40.21,were mixed emotions over the win.
43,00:01:41.75,00:01:41.75,">> I'm really glad that we won, but at the same time, I"
44,00:01:44.67,00:01:44.67,"looked over at Lopevi, and it hurt to know that either Julie"
45,00:01:47.62,00:01:47.62,"or Twila are going home tonight. >> PROBST: At Lopevi, John was"
46,00:01:50.42,00:01:50.42,on the chopping block until Chad questioned Julie's loyalty.
47,00:01:52.96,00:01:52.96,">> I'm not comfortable with Julie staying with us,"
48,00:01:54.96,00:01:54.96,dude. >> Well...
49,00:01:56.12,00:01:56.12,">> If we merge, she's gonna go right with the women."
50,00:01:58.88,00:01:58.88,>> PROBST: And John targeted Chad.
51,00:02:00.54,00:02:00.54,">> Chad-- he gets the sympathy vote, and if it ever came down"
52,00:02:04.00,00:02:04.00,"to him and one of us in the final two, he'd get it in"
53,00:02:06.88,00:02:06.88,a heartbeat. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
54,00:02:09.21,00:02:09.21,"Council, Julie and Twila dodged the vote when the guys trusted"
55,00:02:13.12,00:02:13.12,the women's loyalty and voted out John.
56,00:02:15.29,00:02:15.29,"John, the tribe has spoken. Ten are left."
57,00:02:21.83,00:02:21.83,Who will be voted out tonight? ( theme song playing )
58,00:03:45.17,00:03:45.17,">> Yeah. >> Oh, yeah."
59,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,">> We stay five, we're solid. We go to the end."
60,00:03:48.58,00:03:48.58,>> What happened at Tribal was a wonderful thing...
61,00:03:51.33,00:03:51.33,( laughs ) ...'cause I thought I was going
62,00:03:53.33,00:03:53.33,"home. Temporarily, I'm still here, so"
63,00:03:56.25,00:03:56.25,I'm psyched. >> Are you sure you guys
64,00:03:59.71,00:03:59.71,don't want any manioc? >> I'm good.
65,00:04:01.71,00:04:01.71,">> I don't want any, and I'm-I'm fine."
66,00:04:03.54,00:04:03.54,">> We're sitting around the fire, and Julie just sits down"
67,00:04:07.75,00:04:07.75,between my legs and-and gets warm.
68,00:04:10.04,00:04:10.04,"And I was like, whoa. >> Really good."
69,00:04:11.96,00:04:11.96,>> You know what's going to be so satisfying?
70,00:04:14.38,00:04:14.38,"The women seeing us. >> Oh, definitely."
71,00:04:16.38,00:04:16.38,">> Yeah, they're gonna know we're with you guys."
72,00:04:18.88,00:04:18.88,">> I thought it was interesting at first, but no big deal, she's"
73,00:04:21.21,00:04:21.21,"cold. But then, once the fire started"
74,00:04:23.42,00:04:23.42,"blazing, she just stayed there and kind of snuggled in closer,"
75,00:04:26.04,00:04:26.04,and Sarge was just kind of letting it happen.
76,00:04:40.21,00:04:40.21,( laughter ) >> You see that?
77,00:04:42.29,00:04:42.29,>> I know. When she snuggled up with you?
78,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,">> I was, like, that's hot. >> I know, man."
79,00:04:48.58,00:04:48.58,>> She's just wanting to solidify another three days.
80,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,">> Totally, man. >> Sure."
81,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,">> Like, remember Ginger on Gilligan's Island?"
82,00:04:54.67,00:04:54.67,>> Yeah. >> Hello.
83,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,">> Oh, hell, yes, Julie is using her sex appeal and her young age"
84,00:05:03.96,00:05:03.96,"and her body, trying to get next to the men."
85,00:05:05.79,00:05:05.79,There's no doubt about it. Not much I can do about it.
86,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,She's 22 years younger than I am.
87,00:05:09.83,00:05:09.83,">> You know, Julie's fine, she's hot, you know?"
88,00:05:13.12,00:05:13.12,"She's a model. I mean, I really don't hang out"
89,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,"with too many young, 22-year-old models, you know?"
90,00:05:21.25,00:05:21.25,>> Do it. >> You're not offending me.
91,00:05:22.88,00:05:22.88,"Bare the ass. >> Julie is, like, ""You"
92,00:05:26.00,00:05:26.00,"know, you look good. You ought to expose your body"
93,00:05:27.88,00:05:27.88,"some more."" And I said, ""What the hell?"""
94,00:05:29.96,00:05:29.96,>> I see it. ( Twila laughs )
95,00:05:31.04,00:05:31.04,">> Yeah, that's a white ass. >> Ow, that's a white ass."
96,00:05:34.12,00:05:34.12,We all three ought to do it and slide next to Sarge.
97,00:05:36.71,00:05:36.71,"( Twila laughs ) >> Mine's white, too."
98,00:05:39.04,00:05:39.04,">> Julie is an exhibitionist. I mean, she's comfortable with"
99,00:05:42.12,00:05:42.12,"it. And I told 'em, I'm comfortable"
100,00:05:44.25,00:05:44.25,"with it, because I've been in Europe."
101,00:05:45.79,00:05:45.79,">> Uno, dos, tres. >> Ah!"
102,00:05:52.21,00:05:52.21,>> Sarge... ( Twila laughs )
103,00:05:53.46,00:05:53.46,">> Sarge, what are you doing? >> What are you doing?"
104,00:05:56.54,00:05:56.54,>> I just glanced over there. Sarge has his ass hanging out.
105,00:06:00.21,00:06:00.21,Probably is an image that will never leave my memory.
106,00:06:03.83,00:06:03.83,Julie is a bad influence! ( laughter )
107,00:06:06.83,00:06:06.83,">> Oh. >> Seriously, there is"
108,00:06:08.71,00:06:08.71,"nothing going through my mind of, like, this is going to keep"
109,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,"me solid, but, hey, if those boys want to keep me around"
110,00:06:14.96,00:06:14.96,"strictly for visual stimulation, well then, hey, I got it in the"
111,00:06:17.96,00:06:17.96,"bag then, right? ( cawing )"
112,00:06:23.88,00:06:23.88,( screeching ) ( birds singing )
113,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,">> If Scout and I stopped working, this camp literally"
114,00:06:36.08,00:06:36.08,would stop. Leann and Ami and Eliza should
115,00:06:44.58,00:06:44.58,be disgusted with themselves. Their main activity for the day
116,00:06:48.21,00:06:48.21,consists of waking up late and then sitting on their asses for
117,00:06:51.12,00:06:51.12,"the rest of the day, and I'm tired of it."
118,00:06:54.46,00:06:54.46,( Ami sighs ) >> Is coffee ready to go?
119,00:06:58.12,00:06:58.12,">> I don't know, but it's starting to really hurt to"
120,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,"sleep. >> Leann gets up, and"
121,00:07:02.62,00:07:02.62,"she's a little crabby. She's got coffee right there,"
122,00:07:05.62,00:07:05.62,"she's got water boiled, and she's got plantains ready to"
123,00:07:08.83,00:07:08.83,"eat, and she's crabby. >> Rory, you'd better get over"
124,00:07:11.08,00:07:11.08,here and get some of the breakfast you cooked.
125,00:07:12.75,00:07:12.75,">> Yeah, I'll be over there in a second."
126,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,>> Wait. All that water?
127,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,Yuck. >> You don't like the water?
128,00:07:17.58,00:07:17.58,>> Uh-uh. No. >> Yeah.
129,00:07:18.83,00:07:18.83,>> That doesn't taste good at all.
130,00:07:22.88,00:07:22.88,>> What a worthless crew. What a completely worthless
131,00:07:26.00,00:07:26.00,crew. Stupid people irritate the
132,00:07:30.12,00:07:30.12,living hell out of me. Eliza-- she's like a little kid.
133,00:07:34.75,00:07:34.75,>> All right. Let's try and move the fire.
134,00:07:39.08,00:07:39.08,>> I have personally taught Eliza at least four or five
135,00:07:42.46,00:07:42.46,times how to make a fire. Come over on the side and push
136,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,everything that way. And she's still struggling with
137,00:07:48.12,00:07:48.12,boiling a pot of water! >> I don't know how it
138,00:07:53.71,00:07:53.71,was... earlier. >> And I think Ami is just
139,00:07:58.04,00:07:58.04,taking advantage of everybody. Ami is just riding her little
140,00:08:01.08,00:08:01.08,"queen role, and I'd really like to knock her ass down a peg,"
141,00:08:03.54,00:08:03.54,quite frankly. I'm ready to get the hell out of
142,00:08:06.08,00:08:06.08,"Yasur. I really, really, really want to"
143,00:08:09.08,00:08:09.08,be around some men. I'm tired of these women.
144,00:08:11.88,00:08:11.88,"I'm tired of 'em. >> PROBST: Yasur, getting your"
145,00:08:22.96,00:08:22.96,first look at the new Lopevi tribe.
146,00:08:24.58,00:08:24.58,John voted out at the last Tribal Council.
147,00:08:27.33,00:08:27.33,( sigh ) >> PROBST: What was that
148,00:08:31.38,00:08:31.38,"reaction for, Scout? >> I'm just so happy to see"
149,00:08:33.08,00:08:33.08,Twila. I had a dream last night that
150,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,"Twila had to go home, and she was crying, and I was crying,"
151,00:08:37.33,00:08:37.33,and... Whoo!
152,00:08:39.96,00:08:39.96,Yeah! >> Twila ain't going nowhere.
153,00:08:43.33,00:08:43.33,">> PROBST: Scout, Sarge clearly took that as a sign that you"
154,00:08:46.88,00:08:46.88,think Twila is part of a women's tribe.
155,00:08:49.04,00:08:49.04,">> Well, he can think whatever he wants to think."
156,00:08:50.96,00:08:50.96,I'm just glad to see her. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get
157,00:08:55.04,00:08:55.04,to today's challenge? >> ALL: Yes.
158,00:08:56.54,00:08:56.54,">> PROBST: It is for reward, and you're going to get wet."
159,00:08:59.08,00:08:59.08,You're going to compete tribe versus tribe in a relay-style
160,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,race. Each tribe member will take a
161,00:09:04.71,00:09:04.71,spot at one of five stations. The first tribe member will pick
162,00:09:08.62,00:09:08.62,"up a bucket, race down to the ocean, fill it with water, race"
163,00:09:12.08,00:09:12.08,back to the mat. They will then toss the bucket
164,00:09:14.08,00:09:14.08,with the water in it to the second tribe member who will
165,00:09:16.50,00:09:16.50,toss it to the third tribe member who will toss it to the
166,00:09:19.00,00:09:19.00,fourth tribe member. That person will take whatever
167,00:09:21.42,00:09:21.42,"water is left in the bucket, while holding onto the bucket,"
168,00:09:24.75,00:09:24.75,toss just the water to the fifth tribe member.
169,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,"They will race up the ladder, put the water in the final"
170,00:09:30.46,00:09:30.46,bucket on the fire tower. Once you fill that fire tower
171,00:09:33.54,00:09:33.54,"bucket with water, it will lower, the flame will rise,"
172,00:09:36.46,00:09:36.46,"lighting a fuse, igniting the tower."
173,00:09:38.50,00:09:38.50,The first tribe to ignite the tower wins reward.
174,00:09:41.62,00:09:41.62,Want to know what you're playing for?
175,00:09:43.46,00:09:43.46,">> ALL: Yeah. >> PROBST: Day 19, taste buds"
176,00:09:45.12,00:09:45.12,"still working, but it's been a while."
177,00:09:48.96,00:09:48.96,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: So we thought we
178,00:09:51.29,00:09:51.29,"might have a little dessert. >> Oh! Oh, my God."
179,00:09:53.92,00:09:53.92,>> PROBST: So we have some ice cold milk.
180,00:09:55.88,00:09:55.88,>> Oh. >> And?
181,00:09:57.08,00:09:57.08,>> Jeff... Chris. >> Chris' milk.
182,00:09:59.62,00:09:59.62,( Julie laughs ) >> PROBST: You're a milk lover?
183,00:10:01.38,00:10:01.38,>> I'm a milk lover. >> PROBST: What goes with milk?
184,00:10:03.67,00:10:03.67,>> Cookies. >> Cookies.
185,00:10:04.79,00:10:04.79,>> PROBST: Chocolate chip cookies.
186,00:10:06.21,00:10:06.21,"( cheering ) >> Oh, my God."
187,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,>> All the chocolate chips and milk we can eat.
188,00:10:09.29,00:10:09.29,>> PROBST: But it is day 19. I feel like I ought to go see if
189,00:10:11.42,00:10:11.42,there's something else to complete this dessert.

275,00:15:03.08,00:15:03.08,I wish yesterday's challenge never even happened because I
276,00:15:06.67,00:15:06.67,guess my body just wasn't ready for some sugar.
277,00:15:09.42,00:15:09.42,It made me feel so awful. >> After all that chocolate

283,00:15:32.96,00:15:32.96,because I need these guys to believe that I'm wholeheartedly
284,00:15:35.96,00:15:35.96,on their side and here she is going on about how she missed me
285,00:15:38.75,00:15:38.75,and how she said a prayer for me and she was so glad to see me
286,00:15:41.25,00:15:41.25,"and yadda, yadda, yadda. And hell, yeah, them guys'd be"
287,00:15:43.92,00:15:43.92,stupid if they didn't read something into that last night.
288,00:15:46.75,00:15:46.75,>> I don't think we've got much to worry about.
289,00:15:49.54,00:15:49.54,Julie's security is right here. She proved that in Tribal

296,00:16:10.21,00:16:10.21,something with Sarge already? >> Sarge has never said

298,00:16:17.46,00:16:17.46,choice to take to the final two because he would win.
299,00:16:21.21,00:16:21.21,">> I'm going to be honest with you, I think both of you"
300,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,"got a leg up on me. Dude, I didn't mean to say that."
301,00:16:26.83,00:16:26.83,">> No, I... >> Totally, dude."

303,00:16:31.54,00:16:31.54,"There's a million. >> God, I didn't just say that."
304,00:16:34.17,00:16:34.17,I'm pretty much covering all my bases.
305,00:16:36.00,00:16:36.00,Covering all my bases means I'll be good any way it goes.
306,00:16:39.50,00:16:39.50,"And the final two. >> All right, man."
307,00:16:42.21,00:16:42.21,>> Hey. I threw my hand out.
308,00:16:44.17,00:16:44.17,It's just me reassuring my position in the game because
309,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,"basically I have the same agreement with Sarge, and I've"
310,00:16:50.62,00:16:50.62,pretty much made the same agreement with Julie.
311,00:16:52.54,00:16:52.54,"So, okay, let's say we merge, do you want to stick together and"
312,00:16:55.08,00:16:55.08,watch out for each other or not? >> Yeah.
313,00:16:57.29,00:16:57.29,">> I mean, if you're not comfortable doing it..."
314,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,"If you don't trust me, all you've got to do is tell me."
315,00:17:03.29,00:17:03.29,I understand that. >> No.
316,00:17:05.08,00:17:05.08,">> Maybe I'm going places I shouldn't be going, but if we"
317,00:17:08.25,00:17:08.25,"merge, Julie could go, Sarge could go, Chad could go."
318,00:17:11.88,00:17:11.88,I'm always going to have two others I can rely on to watch
319,00:17:15.04,00:17:15.04,"my back. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
320,00:17:27.04,00:17:27.04,All right. Shall we get to the challenge?

450,00:25:56.79,00:25:56.79,We got wine in the outrigger here.

458,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,"I mean, I never thought I would make it out of Yasur."

462,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,>> Yeah. >> Chad is a total blast
463,00:26:38.92,00:26:38.92,to be around. It's great listening to him.
464,00:26:42.21,00:26:42.21,"We've had a good time. >> Oh, my God."
465,00:26:50.75,00:26:50.75,"Oh, man. We've only been together, like,"
466,00:26:53.75,00:26:53.75,"ten minutes and right off the bat, Rory let me know that Bubba"

468,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,he got crushed like a doggone bug.
469,00:27:07.54,00:27:07.54,">> You know, you just got to talk to Chad, I guess, and..."
470,00:27:10.62,00:27:10.62,and see what's up. >> I want some coffee.
471,00:27:13.71,00:27:13.71,">> Twila, you got a cup right here for yourself."
472,00:27:15.50,00:27:15.50,">> Oh, thank you. >> Yeah, I'm going to the"

478,00:27:32.33,00:27:32.33,>> Nice. >> As soon as we got over
479,00:27:35.71,00:27:35.71,"there, they were like, ""Rory you're gone next."""
480,00:27:37.54,00:27:37.54,Ami told us that. >> She just straight out?
481,00:27:40.21,00:27:40.21,">> Straight off the bat. >> Oh, my..."

485,00:27:49.29,00:27:49.29,>> Okay. >> We knew Ami was all on
486,00:27:52.54,00:27:52.54,the female kick. We knew it.
487,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,">> Ami is the top dog over there, and Ami has had me"

489,00:27:59.54,00:27:59.54,>> Completely. >> How condescending?
490,00:28:01.42,00:28:01.42,">> Oh, it's completely condescending."
491,00:28:03.62,00:28:03.62,>> Sarge! Where's Sarge at?
492,00:28:05.67,00:28:05.67,"He done left, didn't he? >> We're talking about us"
493,00:28:08.92,00:28:08.92,"being Lopevi five, right? Our five-- we are family here."
494,00:28:13.04,00:28:13.04,"We are so solid. I'm like, if there's any"
495,00:28:16.46,00:28:16.46,"fragmentation whatsoever over there, maybe we could bring the"
496,00:28:19.58,00:28:19.58,minority over to our side and pick off the majority.
497,00:28:23.46,00:28:23.46,>> The minority is me. >> Okay.
498,00:28:26.04,00:28:26.04,That's all I need to know. >> I ain't gonna lie to
499,00:28:28.96,00:28:28.96,"you, Rory. I said you weren't a team"
500,00:28:30.29,00:28:30.29,"player, so, I mean, we had our disagreements, and-and they're"
501,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,"behind us, you know. >> That's water under the"
502,00:28:35.08,00:28:35.08,bridge. >> Yeah.
503,00:28:36.21,00:28:36.21,">> To have both Sarge and Chad say, ""Our original alliance"
504,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,"is still running. Are you still in?""-- I'm just"
505,00:28:45.25,00:28:45.25,the cat who swallowed the canary right now.

507,00:28:54.96,00:28:54.96,"them, but I don't have any relationship with Julie and"
508,00:28:58.25,00:28:58.25,"Twila, so really I'm still not in the best spot, but quite"
509,00:29:02.00,00:29:02.00,"frankly, I'm not worried about that today, because my fortunes"
510,00:29:06.17,00:29:06.17,have changed. I'm just so happy right now.
511,00:29:24.17,00:29:24.17,">> Oh, that's going to be good. >> This is going to be"
512,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,the best flag ever. >> Wow.
513,00:29:30.58,00:29:30.58,The new tribe name is Alinta. It's an Aboriginal word that
514,00:29:34.25,00:29:34.25,"means ""we are the fire; we are the people of the fire."""
515,00:29:37.46,00:29:37.46,"And they kind of liked that idea, and took off on it."
516,00:29:40.92,00:29:40.92,( excited murmuring ) >> I know you couldn't
517,00:29:45.79,00:29:45.79,"stand it. >> Well, 'cause I can't"
518,00:29:47.92,00:29:47.92,stand it on myself. I'm so excited about this merge.
519,00:29:50.75,00:29:50.75,It just couldn't be better. I missed the girls who we'd had
520,00:29:53.79,00:29:53.79,"on our original Yasur tribe. Julie especially, 'cause we,"
521,00:29:56.33,00:29:56.33,"like, got really close in the first 12 days and then, you"
522,00:29:58.92,00:29:58.92,"know, being split apart for the last nine days, I've missed her"
523,00:30:01.62,00:30:01.62,a bunch. >> You guys are some
524,00:30:04.38,00:30:04.38,painting fools. >> Even though I got this
525,00:30:13.04,00:30:13.04,"pact going and everybody says don't worry, I see Julie laying"
526,00:30:17.21,00:30:17.21,"next to Ami, and I get real nervous."
527,00:30:20.04,00:30:20.04,>> That looks so cool. >> There is that sense that
528,00:30:24.75,00:30:24.75,a male-female fight might happen at the end.
529,00:30:27.25,00:30:27.25,It might be a scrap out on the playground between the males and
530,00:30:31.33,00:30:31.33,the females. And so then anything can happen.
531,00:30:50.96,00:30:50.96,"( Lea speaks indistinctly ) >> Well, Sarge, thanks"
532,00:30:53.54,00:30:53.54,for cooking. That's a nice little treat for
533,00:30:56.04,00:30:56.04,our side of the camp. You look around at the energy
534,00:31:01.71,00:31:01.71,in the camp. I don't know.
535,00:31:03.17,00:31:03.17,I just have a sense that the guys are feeling a little...
536,00:31:06.83,00:31:06.83,"uh, uneasy. >> 'Cause he's stronger,"
537,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,He's stron... he's a lot physically stronger than Ami.
538,00:31:28.33,00:31:28.33,">> Are you sure you have him? >> Yes, I do."
539,00:31:33.38,00:31:33.38,"The numbers is where it's at, Twila."
540,00:31:35.33,00:31:35.33,It's just math. Rory is trying to get in good
541,00:31:37.38,00:31:37.38,with me 'cause he's... >> That's why Rory needs
542,00:31:40.00,00:31:40.00,to go tonight. That's why.
543,00:31:41.08,00:31:41.08,He needs to go tonight. >> We're down by the creek and
544,00:31:43.88,00:31:43.88,Twila and Julie were bringing up the point of how strong Rory
545,00:31:46.62,00:31:46.62,is at challenges and how he can just sweep through these
546,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,immunities. >> You have to get over
547,00:31:51.12,00:31:51.12,"that whole thing. >> No, not really."
548,00:31:53.54,00:31:53.54,( chuckles ) Not really.)
549,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,>> It kind of appears to be men versus women.
550,00:32:06.04,00:32:06.04,It would make sense to do that because the women are up in
551,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,"numbers, six to four, and we could easily vote the men off."
552,00:32:12.50,00:32:12.50,>> It's like changing oil in a damn car.
553,00:32:15.12,00:32:15.12,">> You're not experienced. >> Ah, well, there's only"
554,00:32:17.62,00:32:17.62,one way to get experience. I really wanted to just start
555,00:32:20.12,00:32:20.12,"voting out the guys one by one and have all women at the end,"
556,00:32:22.71,00:32:22.71,"because, right now, we're at a very critical point."
557,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,This is a huge turning point of the game and the first vote is
558,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,going to be everything. >> Chad says that you and Julie
559,00:32:33.79,00:32:33.79,are interested in voting off Rory.
560,00:32:35.46,00:32:35.46,">> Well, I thought that was the original game plan."
561,00:32:38.62,00:32:38.62,>> Let me just tell you this. Rory is guaranteed to give us
562,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,"numbers. And listen, Twila."
563,00:32:43.67,00:32:43.67,">> I know. >> If we vote off Ami,"
564,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,that breaks the rest of the girls-- they're done.
565,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,>> I just... >> Twila is just insecure.
566,00:32:54.25,00:32:54.25,"She's scared, and you pretty much have to strategize for"
567,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,Twila. We're not making the decision.
568,00:32:59.71,00:32:59.71,We all are making... >> I'm just trying to get you
569,00:33:01.54,00:33:01.54,all to look at all sides of it. We can't be playing back and
570,00:33:04.46,00:33:04.46,forth. >> Maybe you need to talk
571,00:33:06.12,00:33:06.12,to Sarge. >> It's kind of hard with
572,00:33:08.00,00:33:08.00,ten people around here to talk to anybody.
573,00:33:09.54,00:33:09.54,>> I know. >> This is so much fun.
574,00:33:15.96,00:33:15.96,>> Ami has control of all the women.
575,00:33:18.50,00:33:18.50,She gets them in her aura and pulls them in and then tells
576,00:33:22.00,00:33:22.00,"them what to do, and they run out like little chickens, you"
577,00:33:24.04,00:33:24.04,"know, with their head cut off doing what she says, and she"
578,00:33:26.54,00:33:26.54,sits back being the innocent little girl that doesn't do
579,00:33:29.62,00:33:29.62,"anything wrong, and... and it's dangerous."
580,00:33:33.00,00:33:33.00,It's real dangerous. Bottom line is I want her away
581,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,"from Julie, 'cause Julie is like laying under her arm and"
582,00:33:41.67,00:33:41.67,"being kissed on the top of the head by her and stuff, and"
583,00:33:45.04,00:33:45.04,"telling how hot she is and, you know, it's just like what"
584,00:33:49.12,00:33:49.12,"the hell, you know. I just want her..."
585,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,>> Out of here. >> ...out of here before she
586,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,"infects Julie, and she turns her charm on you."
587,00:33:56.75,00:33:56.75,">> No. >> And she says come on,"
588,00:33:58.75,00:33:58.75,"Twila, let's go lay down. >> Sarge."
589,00:34:01.29,00:34:01.29,( both laughing ) ( speaking indistinctly )
590,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,">> No, Twila, lower. >> Each to their own, but"
591,00:34:09.88,00:34:09.88,"no thank you. >> Lower, Twila, there it is."
592,00:34:12.08,00:34:12.08,"Right now, with Twila and Julie, I feel confident about the way"
593,00:34:16.75,00:34:16.75,"they talk. They talk with a lot of faith,"
594,00:34:19.12,00:34:19.12,a lot of character. She's a little confused on who
595,00:34:21.42,00:34:21.42,was going home tonight and she made me a little uneasy for a
596,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,"second. But, you know, we have a"
597,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,"pact, and we're sticking to the pact."
598,00:34:28.54,00:34:28.54,>> All right. That's all I needed to know.
599,00:34:30.58,00:34:30.58,We can't be playing back and forth.
600,00:34:32.12,00:34:32.12,>> We're not going to... >> Because I don't like that.
601,00:34:34.79,00:34:34.79,">> Okay, okay. >> I just told Chris, I"
602,00:34:37.71,00:34:37.71,"said, you all make the choice. If you want to vote for Ami,"
603,00:34:40.21,00:34:40.21,just let me know. Just let me know what you all
604,00:34:42.12,00:34:42.12,"want to do, and I'll follow it. >> I feel confident about Twila."
605,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,I feel confident about Julie and obviously Rory has come back to
606,00:34:50.08,00:34:50.08,Lopevi. We've got the numbers.
607,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,We'll be good to go. Picking them girls off one by
608,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,one is what it's going to be. >> I got bloody knife on
609,00:34:56.33,00:34:56.33,this one and a spider on this one.
610,00:34:58.21,00:34:58.21,>> Evil. >> Evil.
611,00:34:59.67,00:34:59.67,">> I don't know, like, what's been going on throughout"
612,00:35:02.58,00:35:02.58,"the day, but I don't think that Twila and Julie ever left the"
613,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,women's alliance. They had to do what they had to
614,00:35:10.04,00:35:10.04,"do to survive with all men, but I don't see Twila ever, ever"
615,00:35:14.42,00:35:14.42,"leaving the women's alliance. >> Stick five tight, and"
616,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50,we've got it made. >> Okay.
617,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,>> We're going to be in trouble tonight.
618,00:35:20.88,00:35:20.88,>> We are. What are we going to do?
619,00:35:24.00,00:35:24.00,>> Play the game. The guys think we're with them.
620,00:35:30.62,00:35:30.62,"The girls automatically think we're with them, so who knows?"
621,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"After tonight, somebody is going to be pissed, but we've got to"
622,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,do what we've got to do. I feel bad because I care about
623,00:35:40.29,00:35:40.29,"every one of them, but I'm beating them to the punch."
624,00:35:43.25,00:35:43.25,I'm cutting their throat before they cut mine.
625,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,>> PROBST: Welcome. First things first.
626,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,I got to know what the new tribe name is. Ami?
627,00:36:07.38,00:36:07.38,>> Alinta. >> PROBST: Alinta.
628,00:36:09.12,00:36:09.12,"Sarge, how'd you come up with that?"
629,00:36:11.12,00:36:11.12,">> The name came from Scout, who knew the word for"
630,00:36:14.17,00:36:14.17,"fire-maker, so we figured it's appropriate, Islands of Fire,"
631,00:36:17.67,00:36:17.67,"fire-maker. >> PROBST: Julie, what happened"
632,00:36:20.58,00:36:20.58,in terms of workload and leadership and all that?
633,00:36:23.46,00:36:23.46,">> Well, gosh, half the tribe worked on the flag and a"
634,00:36:26.29,00:36:26.29,"lot of people went for wood, and oh, yeah, a lot of the day was"
635,00:36:29.79,00:36:29.79,spent on body paint. >> PROBST: Who does the best
636,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,"work? >> Oh, this one right here."
637,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,That one's by far is the best. >> Yes.
638,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,"( all laughing ) >> PROBST: Well, don't waste"
639,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,your flirting on me. I can't help you any.
640,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,>> I know. >> PROBST: Leann.
641,00:36:45.04,00:36:45.04,Would you have preferred to stay as the Yasur tribe and let
642,00:36:48.54,00:36:48.54,"Lopevi stay as the Lopevi tribe? >> No. I mean, I think a merge"
643,00:36:52.38,00:36:52.38,signifies getting further in the game.
644,00:36:54.92,00:36:54.92,"I mean, having us all come together feels like, ""God, we"
645,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,"really made it this far,"" and this is where it should get fun"
646,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,"and interesting and screwy. >> PROBST: Rory, you've got to"
647,00:37:04.04,00:37:04.04,feel like you were just given a second chance.
648,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,">> I know for a fact that I've been given a second chance,"
649,00:37:09.25,00:37:09.25,because Vegas wouldn't have given me odds on making it out
650,00:37:12.67,00:37:12.67,"of the Yasur camp, quite frankly."
651,00:37:14.71,00:37:14.71,I struggled and I scratched and I clawed and I prayed and I
652,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,hoped that I'd hit a merger for an opportunity for a shot at
653,00:37:21.17,00:37:21.17,"the second half of the game, and that's what I've been able to"
654,00:37:24.38,00:37:24.38,"pull through. >> PROBST: Ami, did you think"
655,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,you'd make it this far? >> Yeah.
656,00:37:28.79,00:37:28.79,>> PROBST: Based on what? What skills do you bring to
657,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,this game? >> What skills do I bring...?
658,00:37:34.54,00:37:34.54,"A da... a good attitude. A good attitude, no matter what."
659,00:37:37.38,00:37:37.38,"Even when things are getting rough, I usually have a good"
660,00:37:40.50,00:37:40.50,attitude. It's gotten me this far in
661,00:37:42.42,00:37:42.42,"life, so... Play with a smile and good"
662,00:37:44.67,00:37:44.67,attitude. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
663,00:37:46.79,00:37:46.79,tonight's vote. It's always tough when you get
664,00:37:48.92,00:37:48.92,"to the merge, because you never know what's going to happen."
665,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,You don't know who you can trust and who you can't trust.
666,00:37:53.58,00:37:53.58,"Twila, do you feel a little stuck in the middle because"
667,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,you've been on both tribes? >> Most definitely.
668,00:37:59.25,00:37:59.25,"Oh, most definitely. I feel real stuck in the middle."
669,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,I've enjoyed both tribes. I felt more at ease around the
670,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,guys-- there's no doubt about that.
671,00:38:06.96,00:38:06.96,"But, you know, you form alliances with one side and then"
672,00:38:09.96,00:38:09.96,"another side and you're kind of stuck in the middle, but"
673,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,"tonight, no matter which way it goes, it's gonna be tough."
674,00:38:15.92,00:38:15.92,">> PROBST: Sarge, you have the immunity necklace, if you want"
675,00:38:18.25,00:38:18.25,"to assign it to somebody else, you can."
676,00:38:19.58,00:38:19.58,>> Nope. It's mine tonight. >> PROBST: All right.
677,00:38:22.21,00:38:22.21,Sarge is the only person you can't vote for.
678,00:38:24.25,00:38:24.25,"Everybody else is fair game. With that, it's time to vote."
679,00:38:26.96,00:38:26.96,"Chris, you're up. >> You're just the, um,"
680,00:38:39.96,00:38:39.96,unfortunate victim of the master plan.
681,00:39:07.58,00:39:07.58,">> RORY: Ami, this is the first time that I've made a completely"
682,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,personal vote. Your treatment of me over the
683,00:39:13.88,00:39:13.88,last nine days has been horrible.
684,00:39:15.88,00:39:15.88,"I have little or no respect for you, and I really hope that,"
685,00:39:19.21,00:39:19.21,"like a bad rash, you're finally gone."
686,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,Thank you. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
687,00:39:47.92,00:39:47.92,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
688,00:40:03.62,00:40:03.62,decision is final. The person voted out will be
689,00:40:05.42,00:40:05.42,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
690,00:40:07.46,00:40:07.46,I'll read the votes. First vote...
691,00:40:12.92,00:40:12.92,Ami. Ami.
692,00:40:19.71,00:40:19.71,That's two votes Ami. Ami. Three votes Ami.
693,00:40:29.67,00:40:29.67,Ami. That's four votes Ami.
694,00:40:34.71,00:40:34.71,"Rory. Four votes Ami, one vote Rory."
695,00:40:40.71,00:40:40.71,"Two votes Rory, four votes Ami. Rory."
696,00:40:47.38,00:40:47.38,"That's four votes Ami, three votes Rory."
697,00:40:54.00,00:40:54.00,"We're tied. Four votes Rory, four votes Ami."
698,00:41:02.79,00:41:02.79,"Rory. That's five votes Rory, four votes Ami."
699,00:41:09.75,00:41:09.75,"Ninth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu, Rory."
700,00:41:14.38,00:41:14.38,"Bring me your torch. Rory, the tribe has spoken."
701,00:41:31.58,00:41:31.58,"It's time for you to go. Well, you are the final nine."
702,00:41:46.92,00:41:46.92,"Seven of you will make up the jury, two will make it to the"
703,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,final Tribal Council. One will win a million dollars.
704,00:41:53.21,00:41:53.21,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
705,00:41:55.25,00:41:55.25,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
706,00:42:14.42,00:42:14.42,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:
707,00:42:18.42,00:42:18.42,">> Camp sucks, kissing and I want to cuddle with you."
708,00:42:21.33,00:42:21.33,"I'm tired of hearing ""I love you, you love me."""
709,00:42:24.00,00:42:24.00,">> I'm pro love, man. >> It makes me sick."
710,00:42:26.62,00:42:26.62,>> PROBST: And Alinta gets a new pet.
711,00:42:28.75,00:42:28.75,>> Help! Come here! >> It's a pig.
712,00:42:30.71,00:42:30.71,>> I can taste his fatback cooked up with my cabbage.
713,00:42:33.08,00:42:33.08,">> No, no, you can't eat him. >> I think that I am the victim"
714,00:42:43.12,00:42:43.12,"of a gender war right now. The women, they have got the men"
715,00:42:46.92,00:42:46.92,bamboozled into thinking that they had an opportunity.
716,00:42:50.08,00:42:50.08,"I may not be a million dollars richer, but I will never forget"
717,00:42:54.08,00:42:54.08,the Islands of Fire. No one has enjoyed the
718,00:42:57.12,00:42:57.12,experience of being on this land more than I have.
