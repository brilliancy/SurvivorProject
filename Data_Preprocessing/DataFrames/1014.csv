2,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,20 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
3,00:00:16.96,00:00:16.96,"Just behind you, there are two immunity necklaces."
4,00:00:20.29,00:00:20.29,"One for the first woman, one for the first man, who can"
5,00:00:23.75,00:00:23.75,get to shore and claim them. >> I'll go!
6,00:00:27.08,00:00:27.08,">> PROBST: From the beginning, it was clear that these"
7,00:00:29.17,00:00:29.17,castaways were in for a whole new game.
8,00:00:31.25,00:00:31.25,>> I was not going to let that little young girl beat me.
9,00:00:35.12,00:00:35.12,">> PROBST: With no other information to guide them,"
10,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,"no one knew what to expect. >> We're not a tribe, we don't"
11,00:00:39.50,00:00:39.50,have our buffs-- we don't have a clue what's happening next.
12,00:00:42.83,00:00:42.83,>> PROBST: We're going to divide into two tribes with nine
13,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,members each. There are 20 of you.
14,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,Two people will get on a boat and be sent home.
15,00:00:51.71,00:00:51.71,Ian and Jolanda learned the value of the immunity necklaces
16,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,when they made the first of the schoolyard picks.
17,00:00:58.17,00:00:58.17,>> Katie. >> Bobby Jon.
18,00:01:00.92,00:01:00.92,">> PROBST: And in the end, Wanda and Jonathan were left"
19,00:01:04.00,00:01:04.00,behind. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Survivors \xe2\x99\xaa
20,00:01:07.00,00:01:07.00,>> Good-bye! >> \xe2\x99\xaa You're going to be the
21,00:01:09.12,00:01:09.12,Survivors. \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Survivors ready?
22,00:01:12.33,00:01:12.33,Go! At the first immunity
23,00:01:14.46,00:01:14.46,"challenge, the Ulong tribe stumbled with crucial decisions."
24,00:01:18.79,00:01:18.79,">> Come on! We gotta go. >> I'm telling you, I think we"
25,00:01:23.58,00:01:23.58,should go. >> PROBST: And the older Koror
26,00:01:26.08,00:01:26.08,tribe proved that age didn't matter when they won immunity
27,00:01:28.75,00:01:28.75,and flint to make fire. Koror wins immunity and reward!
28,00:01:32.79,00:01:32.79,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: At Ulong's first
29,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,"Tribal Council, Jolanda's strength did not prevent her"
30,00:01:39.25,00:01:39.25,"from taking the fall. Jolanda, the tribe has spoken."
31,00:01:46.46,00:01:46.46,"On day four, the tribes battled it out again."
32,00:01:50.88,00:01:50.88,Ulong made a brief comeback. Ulong wins reward!
33,00:01:54.46,00:01:54.46,"But Koror was soon back on a roll, winning challenge after"
34,00:01:57.42,00:01:57.42,challenge. Koror wins their third immunity
35,00:02:00.79,00:02:00.79,challenge in a row! >> Whoo!
36,00:02:04.42,00:02:04.42,>> PROBST: Koror wins their fourth straight immunity
37,00:02:06.42,00:02:06.42,challenge! >> Whoo!
38,00:02:10.12,00:02:10.12,>> PROBST: James. >> Yeah.
39,00:02:12.25,00:02:12.25,>> PROBST: You have not won a single immunity challenge.
40,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,">> When we hear the word ""immunity,"" we subconsciously"
41,00:02:17.42,00:02:17.42,sabotage ourselves. >> PROBST: Ulong was losing
42,00:02:22.25,00:02:22.25,members fast. Even though Koror continued to
43,00:02:31.29,00:02:31.29,"dodge Tribal Council, an alliance of five was exposed."
44,00:02:36.21,00:02:36.21,">> Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian and Tom are one unit."
45,00:02:40.96,00:02:40.96,We're definitely the underdogs here.
46,00:02:44.38,00:02:44.38,>> PROBST: Koror continued their victory sweep...
47,00:02:47.79,00:02:47.79,Koror wins reward! ( whooping )
48,00:02:50.58,00:02:50.58,...losing only Willard at a surprise double Tribal Council.
49,00:02:54.88,00:02:54.88,"Willard, the tribe has spoken. Ulong lost Angie..."
50,00:03:01.83,00:03:01.83,then James and Ibrehem. Ulong had dwindled to a tribe
51,00:03:06.92,00:03:06.92,"of two. >> You know, we tried to"
52,00:03:10.08,00:03:10.08,"prepare, we tried to strategize; nothing has worked"
53,00:03:12.25,00:03:12.25,"for this tribe, I mean nothing. >> I'm still ready to win,"
54,00:03:18.29,00:03:18.29,and I won't give up hope. >> Look at that!
55,00:03:23.46,00:03:23.46,How's that for a shot?! >> Yeah!
56,00:03:25.25,00:03:25.25,"( laughing ) >> PROBST: At Koror, Tom emerged"
57,00:03:27.75,00:03:27.75,"as the tribe leader. >> Oh, wham!"
58,00:03:31.12,00:03:31.12,">> Oh, now, who's the great white shark killer?"
59,00:03:34.12,00:03:34.12,>> PROBST: And Bobby Jon and Stephenie continued to give it
60,00:03:37.25,00:03:37.25,"their all at the challenges. >> Swallow, swallow."
61,00:03:40.25,00:03:40.25,"Swallow it, Bobby Jon. >> PROBST: But Ulong continued"
62,00:03:43.21,00:03:43.21,to come up short. Tom's got it for Koror!
63,00:03:47.54,00:03:47.54,>> It just seems like Tom beats me every single time.
64,00:03:51.08,00:03:51.08,"It's something that's getting real, real old."
65,00:03:52.96,00:03:52.96,>> PROBST: Gregg with a bit of a lead.
66,00:03:55.50,00:03:55.50,On day 18... Koror wins immunity again!
67,00:04:00.04,00:04:00.04,Koror won their seventh straight immunity challenge.
68,00:04:03.12,00:04:03.12,"For the first time, one tribe had made a clean sweep."
69,00:04:06.12,00:04:06.12,"Ulong, because there are only two of you, there'll be no vote."
70,00:04:09.54,00:04:09.54,There will be an individual immunity challenge.
71,00:04:12.29,00:04:12.29,Loser goes home. >> Whoa.
72,00:04:15.08,00:04:15.08,">> PROBST: Stephenie and Bobby Jon, who had worked so hard"
73,00:04:17.25,00:04:17.25,"to keep their tribe alive, were forced to face off against each"
74,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,other. Survivors ready?
75,00:04:23.21,00:04:23.21,Begin. Though Stephenie had doubts
76,00:04:25.71,00:04:25.71,about her fire-making skills... Steph's torch is lit.
77,00:04:28.75,00:04:28.75,"Just like that, this challenge is over."
78,00:04:30.92,00:04:30.92,Steph. ...she came out victorious.
79,00:04:37.50,00:04:37.50,">> See you later, Ulong! >> PROBST: The next day,"
80,00:04:40.75,00:04:40.75,Stephenie joined the Koror tribe.
81,00:04:42.04,00:04:42.04,">> Oh, my, God, I have friends! >> Having somebody new in town,"
82,00:04:45.12,00:04:45.12,"it was like, a guest, you know? >> PROBST: But secretly some saw"
83,00:04:48.12,00:04:48.12,Stephenie as a very real threat.
84,00:04:50.62,00:04:50.62,">> I'm really worried. The longer she's with us, the"
85,00:04:53.17,00:04:53.17,"more she's gonna make friends, and she's gonna weasel her way"
86,00:04:56.46,00:04:56.46,in. I think she needs to go really
87,00:04:58.75,00:04:58.75,fast. >> PROBST: But Coby took the
88,00:05:01.08,00:05:01.08,heat off Stephenie when he exposed too many of the tribe's
89,00:05:04.08,00:05:04.08,secrets. >> All these people are playing
90,00:05:05.79,00:05:05.79,a game. There's already alliances built.
91,00:05:08.12,00:05:08.12,We're going to pick each other off.
92,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67,It's a game. >> PROBST: Tom won the first
93,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,"individual immunity. And at Tribal Council, Coby's"
94,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50,"loose lips cost him the game, and he became the first member"
95,00:05:20.54,00:05:20.54,"of the jury. On day 25, Janu was on her last"
96,00:05:25.25,00:05:25.25,"leg and fed up with her tribe. >> What are we, junior high,"
97,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,Katie? If I had something to say about
98,00:05:32.08,00:05:32.08,"you, I swear to God, I would come up and say it to your face."
99,00:05:35.21,00:05:35.21,>> Janu is a crazy person. >> PROBST: Though Janu seemed
100,00:05:37.38,00:05:37.38,"ready to go, Stephenie sensed that she was in danger."
101,00:05:41.12,00:05:41.12,">> I mean, we all agreed that it was Janu tonight, and Janu"
102,00:05:43.75,00:05:43.75,"wants it to be her, but for some reason, I have a feeling"
103,00:05:46.42,00:05:46.42,"it's me. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
104,00:05:48.04,00:05:48.04,Stephenie's worst fears were realized when it became clear
105,00:05:50.54,00:05:50.54,"that she was next to go. >> The game is on, and"
106,00:05:55.08,00:05:55.08,eliminating competition is part of this game.
107,00:05:57.75,00:05:57.75,">> PROBST: Stephenie, do you feel you're in a hot seat"
108,00:05:59.88,00:05:59.88,tonight? >> ( voice cracking ): I know I
109,00:06:02.00,00:06:02.00,am. I guess I showed too much heart.
110,00:06:04.92,00:06:04.92,>> PROBST: But Janu threw a wrench in the tribe's plan.
111,00:06:06.92,00:06:06.92,>> I would be willing to lay down my torch so Stephenie can
112,00:06:08.92,00:06:08.92,have a chance to stay in the game.
113,00:06:12.75,00:06:12.75,">> PROBST: Janu, per your wishes, this game is over for"
114,00:06:14.75,00:06:14.75,"you. >> Thank you, Jeff."
115,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,">> PROBST: In a last-ditch effort to save herself,"
116,00:06:22.71,00:06:22.71,Stephenie agreed to Katie's plan for an all-girl alliance.
117,00:06:29.25,00:06:29.25,>> Who would be the first one you'd want off?
118,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,>> You want to think I'm a threat?
119,00:06:36.29,00:06:36.29,I'll show you how threatening I am.
120,00:06:38.17,00:06:38.17,>> PROBST: But hopes of an all-woman's alliance crumbled
121,00:06:41.04,00:06:41.04,when Caryn spilled the beans to Tom.
122,00:06:43.04,00:06:43.04,>> What did you hear? >> Just that the girls are
123,00:06:45.08,00:06:45.08,talking. >> What did the girls say?
124,00:06:46.71,00:06:46.71,>> Trying to figure out which guy to take out.
125,00:06:51.62,00:06:51.62,>> We can't get a female alliance together because Caryn
126,00:06:54.04,00:06:54.04,"sucks. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
127,00:06:56.50,00:06:56.50,Stephenie's hard-fought battle finally came to an end when she
128,00:07:01.38,00:07:01.38,"was voted out. Steph, the tribe has spoken."
129,00:07:05.75,00:07:05.75,"With only original Koror tribe members left, the real"
130,00:07:09.58,00:07:09.58,backstabbing was about to begin.
131,00:07:13.83,00:07:13.83,"On day 31, Gregg won a reward aboard a luxury yacht."
132,00:07:18.08,00:07:18.08,"Obviously, it wouldn't be much fun alone."
133,00:07:19.88,00:07:19.88,Gregg chose to take Jenn and Katie along for the ride.
134,00:07:23.08,00:07:23.08,">> Guys, I'm so sorry. I will, uh, pay you back."
135,00:07:25.75,00:07:25.75,">> Oh, no, we'll pay you back. >> PROBST: Back at camp..."
136,00:07:29.46,00:07:29.46,>> We have lost lost control of the game.
137,00:07:31.21,00:07:31.21,>> PROBST: ...Ian realized it was three against three.
138,00:07:33.50,00:07:33.50,>> I know they're ready to turn on you.
139,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,>> And you think Katie's in with that?
140,00:07:36.58,00:07:36.58,>> Definitely. >> PROBST: So they concocted a
141,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,"risky plan to force Gregg out. >> I can go to Tribal Council,"
142,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,willing to take the rock. I came to play a game.
143,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,>> That's the plan. You and I are both willing to
144,00:07:47.38,00:07:47.38,choose rocks. >> Tom and I have decided that
145,00:07:49.17,00:07:49.17,we're gonna force a tie at Tribal Council.
146,00:07:51.25,00:07:51.25,We've prepared ourselves for the idea that we might be going
147,00:07:53.92,00:07:53.92,"home, but this is a risk we have to take."
148,00:07:56.33,00:07:56.33,">> PROBST: Meanwhile, Gregg, Jenn and Katie strategized on"
149,00:07:58.71,00:07:58.71,their own. >> We happen to have a good
150,00:08:01.25,00:08:01.25,bond. This was our opportunity to
151,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,"confirm that, ""Hey, guys, it's us three to the final three."""
152,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,">> PROBST: But right before Tribal Council, Ian let Katie"
153,00:08:09.88,00:08:09.88,in on the plot to oust Gregg. >> We're gonna flip it tonight.
154,00:08:14.38,00:08:14.38,"Yeah, Caryn and Tom and I are going to vote for Gregg."
155,00:08:17.38,00:08:17.38,There's only two people in this game that I made promises to.
156,00:08:21.25,00:08:21.25,"Tom's one, Katie's the other, so I'm gonna stay true to that."
157,00:08:25.67,00:08:25.67,>> PROBST: Ian's gamble paid off.
158,00:08:27.58,00:08:27.58,"Katie joined Ian, Tom and Caryn, and voted Gregg out"
159,00:08:31.33,00:08:31.33,before the tie could occur. >> ( inhaling ): You guys are
160,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,good. >> I got it. I got it.
161,00:08:40.33,00:08:40.33,>> PROBST: Jenn was upset that she had been left out of the
162,00:08:43.83,00:08:43.83,"plot against Gregg. >> Wow, okay. Game on."
163,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,>> PROBST: Ian and Katie's bond continued to strengthen...
164,00:08:50.58,00:08:50.58,>> I did make a promise. >> PROBST: ...when he promised
165,00:08:52.83,00:08:52.83,to take Katie with him on the next reward he won.
166,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,">> Katie and I promised each other if we won a challenge,"
167,00:08:58.17,00:08:58.17,we'd take each other and that's what we're going to do today.
168,00:09:00.33,00:09:00.33,>> PROBST: Ian wins reward. But when Ian won a car and a
169,00:09:04.29,00:09:04.29,"trip to a luxury mansion, he chose to take Tom instead."
170,00:09:07.50,00:09:07.50,">> I told Katie I'd take her, but I made a deal if there was"
171,00:09:10.83,00:09:10.83,"a car involved, that I would take Tom."
172,00:09:12.54,00:09:12.54,>> PROBST: Katie was furious. >> Ian pulled me aside
173,00:09:15.38,00:09:15.38,"yesterday, and was, like, ""I'm telling you right now, I will"
174,00:09:17.83,00:09:17.83,"choose you over Tom,"" and then he took Tom, and I feel like I"
175,00:09:21.21,00:09:21.21,lost my best friend out here. >> PROBST: So Katie resurrected
176,00:09:23.71,00:09:23.71,"talk of an all-girl alliance. >> If it's Ian, we vote out Tom,"
177,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,right? >> Right
178,00:09:29.08,00:09:29.08,">> And if it's Tom, we vote out Ian."
179,00:09:31.08,00:09:31.08,>> That's right. I'm all about that.
180,00:09:33.08,00:09:33.08,>> I love that. >> PROBST: When Tom and Ian
181,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,"returned from the reward, Ian and Katie had an emotional"
182,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,confrontation. >> You said you would never lie
183,00:09:40.75,00:09:40.75,"to me, and you did. You didn't even think about how"
184,00:09:43.17,00:09:43.17,that was going to make me feel to have you go against your
185,00:09:46.04,00:09:46.04,word. >> Just please know that over
186,00:09:47.62,00:09:47.62,"and above the mistake that I made, that I hope you can"

376,00:22:54.33,00:22:54.33,Ian right behind. There are three numbers in that
377,00:22:57.21,00:22:57.21,"bag. The three numbers, in some"
378,00:22:59.75,00:22:59.75,"order, are the combination to your locks."
379,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,Ian has his untied. ( Ian whoops )
380,00:23:11.42,00:23:11.42,Tom falling behind. Ian already starting to work
381,00:23:16.21,00:23:16.21,on the combination. Tom now has his numbers out.
382,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,Ian wrong on his first one. Tom now working on his
383,00:23:27.58,00:23:27.58,combination. A little bit of luck involved
384,00:23:30.08,00:23:30.08,here. Which numbers do you pick?
385,00:23:32.00,00:23:32.00,Tom wrong on his first one. Ian wrong again.
386,00:23:40.88,00:23:40.88,Tom trying a new set of numbers. Wrong again.
387,00:23:50.38,00:23:50.38,Ian doesn't have it. Tom's got a new combination.
388,00:23:54.29,00:23:54.29,Is this gonna be right? He's got it!
389,00:23:59.00,00:23:59.00,Tom has his lock undone; box is open.
390,00:24:04.54,00:24:04.54,Tom has his flag undone. ( frustrated grunt )
391,00:24:10.92,00:24:10.92,Tom raises his flag. Tom wins immunity!
392,00:24:21.12,00:24:21.12,">> Nice job, Tom. >> Ah! Good job."
393,00:24:24.79,00:24:24.79,"That was a good win. >> PROBST: Tom, get over here."
394,00:24:29.58,00:24:29.58,Couldn't come at a better time. Turn around.

396,00:24:37.92,00:24:37.92,"Ian, Katie, Jenn, one of you is going home tonight."
397,00:24:42.04,00:24:42.04,See you at Tribal. Head on back to camp.
398,00:25:00.50,00:25:00.50,>> That was the biggest challenge I've ever seen.
399,00:25:03.50,00:25:03.50,>> It was huge. It was huge. >> It didn't stop.
400,00:25:06.29,00:25:06.29,"It was, like, three hours long. >> I went over and over it again"
401,00:25:14.12,00:25:14.12,"and again in my head, to send Tom home if I were to win or"
402,00:25:18.21,00:25:18.21,"send Jenn home, and as it turned out, I didn't win."
403,00:25:21.42,00:25:21.42,So it's gonna be Jenn that goes home tonight.
404,00:25:25.29,00:25:25.29,>> You pretty much are guaranteed a place in the

411,00:25:46.50,00:25:46.50,whatever you got to do to get ahead.
412,00:25:49.04,00:25:49.04,I'm just telling Jenn that in spite of how tempting it is
413,00:25:52.50,00:25:52.50,"to cut you loose and let you fly tonight, ( laughs ): um..."
414,00:25:55.62,00:25:55.62,"I can't do it, I won't do it, because of, you know, the bond"
415,00:26:00.04,00:26:00.04,"that we've made and-and the promises, and, uh..."
416,00:26:03.58,00:26:03.58,>> I'd rather have that than... >> I believe so.

424,00:26:26.08,00:26:26.08,should know that you'll stand by him.
425,00:26:29.83,00:26:29.83,( sniffles ) I'm taking a risk.
426,00:26:33.17,00:26:33.17,">> Oh, little Jenn... >> But that's my move."
427,00:26:45.92,00:26:45.92,>> I just felt like such a loser.

555,00:33:16.96,00:33:16.96,"even considering that. >> No, that's not true."
556,00:33:18.58,00:33:18.58,>> I just have one question for you.
557,00:33:20.58,00:33:20.58,>> Okay. >> Have you lied to me in the
558,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,last 24 hours? Straight out.
559,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,>> Have I lied to you in the past 24 hours?
560,00:33:28.83,00:33:28.83,No. Straight out. >> PROBST: Everybody have all
561,00:33:34.42,00:33:34.42,the information they need? The only thing we know is Tom's
562,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,not going anywhere because he has immunity.
563,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,Want to give it up? >> You know what?
564,00:33:43.79,00:33:43.79,I'm going to hang onto it. Things are a little rocky over
565,00:33:45.96,00:33:45.96,here. >> PROBST: Everybody else is
566,00:33:47.71,00:33:47.71,fair game. It is time to vote.
567,00:33:50.46,00:33:50.46,"Jenn, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
568,00:34:34.21,00:34:34.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final, person voted"
569,00:34:36.92,00:34:36.92,out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
570,00:34:39.42,00:34:39.42,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Ian."
571,00:34:50.67,00:34:50.67,Jenn. One vote Jenn.
572,00:34:56.88,00:34:56.88,"Ian. Two votes Ian, one vote Jenn."
573,00:35:01.71,00:35:01.71,I'll read the last vote. Jenn.
574,00:35:09.29,00:35:09.29,We're tied. Here's what's going to happen:
575,00:35:14.08,00:35:14.08,"Jenn, you will not vote again. Ian, you will not vote again."
576,00:35:16.67,00:35:16.67,Only Katie and Tom will vote. If neither of you change your
577,00:35:22.21,00:35:22.21,"votes, we will be deadlocked and we'll move to a tiebreaker."
578,00:35:24.79,00:35:24.79,"Katie, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
579,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final, person voted"
580,00:36:03.21,00:36:03.21,out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
581,00:36:05.75,00:36:05.75,I'll read the votes. First vote...
582,00:36:12.21,00:36:12.21,Jenn. One vote Jenn.
583,00:36:14.21,00:36:14.21,I'll read the other vote. Ian.
584,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,"We're still tied. All right, because there are"
585,00:36:24.12,00:36:24.12,"only four of you, one of you has immunity, we don't draw rocks."
586,00:36:28.38,00:36:28.38,Tiebreaker works a little differently.
587,00:36:31.88,00:36:31.88,"Jenn and Ian, you will take part in a tie-breaker challenge"
588,00:36:35.29,00:36:35.29,involving fire that will decide your fate in this game.
589,00:36:39.54,00:36:39.54,Take a spot behind one of the fire-making urns and I'll
590,00:36:43.04,00:36:43.04,explain. You each have a box of
591,00:36:47.79,00:36:47.79,fire-making materials. The challenge is simple: build a
592,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,fire with the flame high enough and hot enough to burn through
593,00:36:54.29,00:36:54.29,"the rope. When you burn through the rope,"
594,00:36:56.83,00:36:56.83,you'll raise your flag. First person to raise their flag
595,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,"stays in this game, moves on to the final three."
596,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,The other person goes home. You ready?
597,00:37:07.21,00:37:07.21,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Go.
598,00:37:14.96,00:37:14.96,Jenn has a little something going.
599,00:37:20.58,00:37:20.58,"Ian has a big flame, but a lot of that is just coconut husks"
600,00:37:24.29,00:37:24.29,burning. The key is to build the flame
601,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,high enough and hot enough to burn through that rope.
602,00:37:30.12,00:37:30.12,Ian got a legitimate fire going right now.
603,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,It's hitting the rope. Jenn needs to get something
604,00:37:37.62,00:37:37.62,going. Ian is very close.
605,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,"He's got fire on the rope, very close to burning through."
606,00:37:48.75,00:37:48.75,"Once that flag raises, this challenge is over."
607,00:38:01.04,00:38:01.04,And there it is. Ian stays in this game.
608,00:38:09.54,00:38:09.54,"Ian, go ahead and take a spot next to Katie."
609,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,"Jenn, you need to bring me your torch."
610,00:38:22.75,00:38:22.75,"Jenn, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
611,00:38:29.04,00:38:29.04,">> Good luck, guys. >> PROBST: You three are the"
612,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,final three. I'm sure it's going to be an
613,00:38:44.29,00:38:44.29,"interesting night at camp tonight, as well as tomorrow"
614,00:38:46.83,00:38:46.83,when you take part in your final immunity challenge.
615,00:38:49.92,00:38:49.92,I suggest you try and get some sleep.
616,00:38:51.96,00:38:51.96,"You're going to need it-- grab your torches, head back to camp."
617,00:38:55.71,00:38:55.71,"Good night. >> I lasted 37 days, but it"
618,00:39:01.04,00:39:01.04,didn't work out my way. I am a little disappointed in
619,00:39:05.25,00:39:05.25,Katie. She had a chance to keep me
620,00:39:07.46,00:39:07.46,"around a little bit longer, and she went against that."
621,00:39:09.67,00:39:09.67,"So, Katie, I don't know if you have my vote any longer."
622,00:39:31.92,00:39:31.92,">> We came back to camp, and I'm thinking, ""Wow, I just cast a"
623,00:39:35.33,00:39:35.33,"vote against Ian and tried to get rid of him."""
624,00:39:38.79,00:39:38.79,He's still here. And then you're saying to
625,00:39:40.96,00:39:40.96,"yourself, ""I am right, aren't I? I mean, he did just try to"
626,00:39:44.12,00:39:44.12,"submarine me."" You know, it's a personal"
627,00:39:46.12,00:39:46.12,grudge now. It's kind of like it's
628,00:39:49.25,00:39:49.25,"already out of the bag, so... >> I know, but what do you want"
629,00:39:51.88,00:39:51.88,me to tell you? What do you want to hear from
630,00:39:53.54,00:39:53.54,"me? >> Tell me the truth, which is"
631,00:39:55.33,00:39:55.33,that you weren't going with me to the final three to duke it
632,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,out like men. >> That is not the truth.
633,00:39:59.33,00:39:59.33,>> And now I'm supposed to buy the fact that just prior to me
634,00:40:03.25,00:40:03.25,"winning immunity, you had made up your mind to do the right"
635,00:40:06.25,00:40:06.25,"thing? No, not after I won."
636,00:40:08.25,00:40:08.25,Not after I won the immunity. >> No!
637,00:40:10.08,00:40:10.08,>> Come on. You are like the worst liar.
638,00:40:12.04,00:40:12.04,It's all out now. It's all going to be said.
639,00:40:14.54,00:40:14.54,">> That really sucks, because, you know what?"
640,00:40:16.21,00:40:16.21,Tom's been sticking up for you this whole time.
641,00:40:18.21,00:40:18.21,"""Ian's never wavered."" >> I did believe that that he"
642,00:40:22.46,00:40:22.46,"would never flip on you. >> Gosh, Tom, you're twisting"
643,00:40:24.88,00:40:24.88,the truth. >> I'm twisting the truth?
644,00:40:27.04,00:40:27.04,"Come on, you gotta be kidding me."
645,00:40:29.04,00:40:29.04,>> We sat there... >> There's all three of us.
646,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,There's no more lying now. Everyone's got different
647,00:40:33.04,00:40:33.04,"stories. >> No matter, no matter what I"
648,00:40:35.58,00:40:35.58,"say, no matter what I say, I'm the bad guy tonight, and you"
649,00:40:38.38,00:40:38.38,know what? >> 'Cause you're lying to her
650,00:40:40.42,00:40:40.42,and to me. >> Why don't you just fess up to
651,00:40:42.96,00:40:42.96,it? >> Fess up to what?!
652,00:40:44.29,00:40:44.29,">> Say that you... Yeah, you told me you were"
653,00:40:46.29,00:40:46.29,going to take out Tom with Jenn and I.
654,00:40:48.29,00:40:48.29,">> I did, I told him that already."
655,00:40:50.25,00:40:50.25,"We're playing a game! >> Yeah, but..."
656,00:40:52.71,00:40:52.71,>> We're playing a game. We're playing a game.
657,00:40:54.79,00:40:54.79,>> We thought we were all playing the game together.
658,00:40:56.88,00:40:56.88,">> Yeah, yeah. >> I thought that was the plan,"
659,00:40:59.42,00:40:59.42,"we take this to the final three, and I held to it."
660,00:41:02.25,00:41:02.25,I held to it right up to... I was walking on to that beach
661,00:41:05.79,00:41:05.79,"tonight to make my vote, and get rid of Jenn and fight you"
662,00:41:08.71,00:41:08.71,tomorrow. >> And you are crucifying me
663,00:41:11.12,00:41:11.12,"for, for a decision that I didn't even make."
664,00:41:13.42,00:41:13.42,>> You didn't get the chance. You had the immunity necklace?
665,00:41:18.67,00:41:18.67,I'm home taking a shower right now.
666,00:41:20.75,00:41:20.75,I just wish you'd say that. I just wish you would just be
667,00:41:24.04,00:41:24.04,"able to say, ""You're right, Tom."""
668,00:41:25.96,00:41:25.96,>> It didn't have to be so ugly. It just didn't.
669,00:41:28.75,00:41:28.75,>> I didn't... Tom... >> What are you trying to
670,00:41:30.33,00:41:30.33,salvage? The game is what the game's
671,00:41:32.17,00:41:32.17,"going to be. >> I'm not trying to salvage,"
672,00:41:34.00,00:41:34.00,I'm telling you. I'm telling you what was going
673,00:41:36.08,00:41:36.08,through my mind and my heart and my soul.
674,00:41:39.17,00:41:39.17,"That's what I'm telling you. >> Oh, it's your soul that's"
675,00:41:42.08,00:41:42.08,"speaking to us now. >> That's where, that's where it"
676,00:41:44.08,00:41:44.08,"gets skewed, Ian. Why don't you just say, ""Hey,"
677,00:41:46.29,00:41:46.29,"I'm playing a game. ""I'm making double deals"
678,00:41:48.29,00:41:48.29,"everywhere, and I got caught""? Why can't you just say that?"
679,00:41:52.17,00:41:52.17,Why can't you understand that's what you've been doing?
680,00:41:54.17,00:41:54.17,">> That's kind of refreshing. Actually, you can borrow"
681,00:41:56.17,00:41:56.17,that speech. That was a good one.
682,00:41:58.62,00:41:58.62,"I'd love to tell you that it's time to just step up, be a man"
683,00:42:02.38,00:42:02.38,"and admit to the whole thing, but, you know, that will, I"
684,00:42:05.46,00:42:05.46,"don't know, that will come with age, I guess, where you just are"
685,00:42:08.96,00:42:08.96,willing to fess up. It's just weasely to still be
686,00:42:11.25,00:42:11.25,"saying that, ""I wasn't going to do it, I wasn't going to do it."""
687,00:42:14.92,00:42:14.92,You slipped tonight and you blew it.
688,00:42:41.88,00:42:41.88,>> Last night was probably one of the worst nights of my life.
689,00:42:45.08,00:42:45.08,"Like, it shouldn't be like this."
690,00:42:47.12,00:42:47.12,"I basically got laid out. I mean, just totally laid out."
691,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17,"My game that I've been playing the entire time was, was put to"
692,00:42:53.75,00:42:53.75,"the fire, and nobody else could do any wrong."
693,00:42:57.04,00:42:57.04,There was no other person that ever told any fib or any lie.
694,00:43:01.58,00:43:01.58,>> You didn't have to sleep out here.
695,00:43:11.88,00:43:11.88,So what are you going to do today?
696,00:43:13.54,00:43:13.54,>> I have no idea. >> Are you going to fight?
697,00:43:16.79,00:43:16.79,">> I'm not afraid to. >> Well, I think you should."
698,00:43:21.08,00:43:21.08,>> I think I might. >> Especially because then you
699,00:43:24.00,00:43:24.00,should pick me. >> It was my intention in the
700,00:43:26.62,00:43:26.62,"first place. >> I'd like to believe that,"
701,00:43:29.08,00:43:29.08,"but, it's hard, you know? >> Last night was really rough."
702,00:43:33.71,00:43:33.71,">> You can say that again. >> It just, it stabs me."
703,00:43:37.12,00:43:37.12,( sobbing ): I didn't come out here to play the villain.
704,00:43:40.25,00:43:40.25,"I didn't come out here to, like, be this, be the-the backstabber,"
705,00:43:44.46,00:43:44.46,"especially to those two. Like, sure, you play the game"
706,00:43:48.96,00:43:48.96,"for yourself. Like, you play the game for a"
707,00:43:51.12,00:43:51.12,million dollars. You play the game.
708,00:43:53.17,00:43:53.17,"I came out here to win a million bucks, and I would lie to"
709,00:43:56.25,00:43:56.25,anybody if I wasn't telling them that I wasn't playing the game
710,00:43:59.75,00:43:59.75,"for myself, but the bottom line is, I wanted Katie and Tom in"
711,00:44:03.17,00:44:03.17,"the final three, and we got here."
712,00:44:06.08,00:44:06.08,Am I wrong? Is there something that
713,00:44:08.88,00:44:08.88,"I'm really doing wrong here? Or, you know, am I just playing"
714,00:44:12.17,00:44:12.17,"the game, just like everybody else?"
715,00:44:15.04,00:44:15.04,"Right now, I'm gonna fight. I'm going to stand up there and"
716,00:44:18.04,00:44:18.04,I'm going to take him to the mat because I'm not afraid.
717,00:44:20.67,00:44:20.67,">> Tree mail. Tree mail, Tom."
718,00:44:25.38,00:44:25.38,>> I'm going to go to the final two.

738,00:45:41.42,00:45:41.42,humbles you and teaches you a lot about yourself.
739,00:45:45.67,00:45:45.67,"I can go home knowing that I pushed myself physically,"
740,00:45:52.00,00:45:52.00,"mentally, as far as I could go, and, you know what?"
741,00:45:54.88,00:45:54.88,"I actually, I was okay. I survived."
742,00:45:57.21,00:45:57.21,>> Who we got? >> We got Jeff.
743,00:46:01.17,00:46:01.17,">> I made a big, bonehead mistake, going out in the middle"
744,00:46:04.38,00:46:04.38,"of the night, rolled my ankle on a coconut."
745,00:46:07.79,00:46:07.79,I don't know how much worse you can go out.
746,00:46:09.79,00:46:09.79,But you know what? I don't regret a second of it.
747,00:46:11.79,00:46:11.79,I wouldn't change a single thing.
748,00:46:13.62,00:46:13.62,"If this is how I had to go, this is how I had to go."
749,00:46:16.33,00:46:16.33,At least nobody hates me. >> Kim.
750,00:46:22.12,00:46:22.12,>> Kim. >> I think being in this game
751,00:46:29.29,00:46:29.29,has allowed me to finally embrace who I am and the mental
752,00:46:33.04,00:46:33.04,abilities that I have to see people for who they are and for
753,00:46:37.12,00:46:37.12,what's really buried deep inside of them.
754,00:46:43.46,00:46:43.46,">> Okay, got Willard. >> Good-bye, Willard."
755,00:46:50.83,00:46:50.83,>> I wasn't nearly as grumpy as I am in my day-to-day life.
756,00:46:54.00,00:46:54.00,'Cause I made a real effort not to do that.
757,00:46:56.08,00:46:56.08,"You know, I didn't win the money, but I won the game of"
758,00:46:59.08,00:46:59.08,"life, and that's the important part."
759,00:47:05.21,00:47:05.21,>> Angie. >> I've never really been part
760,00:47:12.12,00:47:12.12,"of a team before. Like, I've never had that"
761,00:47:14.67,00:47:14.67,"experience where, you know, you're relying on somebody else"
762,00:47:17.17,00:47:17.17,to kind of help get you through something.
763,00:47:19.46,00:47:19.46,I've always relied on myself for just about everything.
764,00:47:22.17,00:47:22.17,"I wanted to, you know, prove that I could stick it out"
765,00:47:24.83,00:47:24.83,"and be as physical as some of the other people, you know."
766,00:47:27.29,00:47:27.29,So I think they were really... people were surprised
767,00:47:29.25,00:47:29.25,that I turned out to be as tough as I was.
768,00:47:33.08,00:47:33.08,>> ( southern twang ): We've got James.
769,00:47:34.79,00:47:34.79,Made me laugh every time he came to a challenge.
770,00:47:37.62,00:47:37.62,">> I'll tell you what, James was a character."
771,00:47:39.29,00:47:39.29,>> He was a character. >> Definitely a character.
772,00:47:41.12,00:47:41.12,It wouldn't have been the same without him.
773,00:47:44.54,00:47:44.54,>> I come into this game thinking I was gonna conquer
774,00:47:47.33,00:47:47.33,all. Ooh-doggy!
775,00:47:49.54,00:47:49.54,The most important thing I'm gonna take home with me is not
776,00:47:53.25,00:47:53.25,take my life for granted anymore.
777,00:47:56.17,00:47:56.17,">> Ibrehem, the strong, silent one, right?"
778,00:47:57.79,00:47:57.79,>> Yeah. >> Good guy.
779,00:48:03.00,00:48:03.00,">> From being rained on, being hungry, being tired, then"
780,00:48:06.46,00:48:06.46,having to come back and maybe listen to people bicker a
781,00:48:10.71,00:48:10.71,"little bit, I think me being out here made me a little more"
782,00:48:15.42,00:48:15.42,spiritual. >> Bobby Jon.
783,00:48:19.75,00:48:19.75,>> Never stopped working. >> Tough competitor; he was
784,00:48:22.08,00:48:22.08,always conducting himself like a gentleman.
785,00:48:24.21,00:48:24.21,>> Did not like to lose. >> You were hot.
786,00:48:31.42,00:48:31.42,>> I have no regrets at all. I totally fulfilled my destiny.
787,00:48:35.29,00:48:35.29,"I can honestly say that I left every inch, every effort, every"
788,00:48:39.88,00:48:39.88,"blood, sweat that I had in my body, every toenail out on that"
789,00:48:44.46,00:48:44.46,"island. >> Coby, Coby, Coby, Coby."
790,00:48:51.38,00:48:51.38,">> I played the whole game too hard, which is why they saw me"
791,00:48:54.75,00:48:54.75,"as a threat, but I don't care. This is my experience."
792,00:48:57.42,00:48:57.42,"That's what I wanted. So, no regrets, none."
793,00:49:02.08,00:49:02.08,>> Janu. >> My experience in Survivor
794,00:49:08.83,00:49:08.83,was like a roller coaster. I am glad that I made the
795,00:49:12.42,00:49:12.42,decision to lay down my torch at Tribal Council.
796,00:49:16.88,00:49:16.88,I messed up the plans of those that were trying to keep me in
797,00:49:19.75,00:49:19.75,"and so I liked that. >> All right, let's move on."
798,00:49:30.21,00:49:30.21,">> Steph. I love her. >> Yeah, I do, too."
799,00:49:32.54,00:49:32.54,>> A good spirit. >> A really good spirit.
800,00:49:40.29,00:49:40.29,">> I never knew how strong I really was, both mentally and"
801,00:49:43.46,00:49:43.46,"physically, until I came into this game."
802,00:49:48.50,00:49:48.50,"To just continue to be the last one standing in my tribe, here"
803,00:49:52.17,00:49:52.17,it turns out that I was the strongest.
804,00:49:55.42,00:49:55.42,">> All right, guys. This is a tough one."
805,00:49:57.96,00:49:57.96,Gregg. >> For me to come away from the
806,00:50:03.83,00:50:03.83,"experience and just be more excited to get back to a life,"
807,00:50:06.96,00:50:06.96,friends and family that I love and have my integrity and be
808,00:50:11.00,00:50:11.00,"proud of who I am and who I was during this game, is just a"
809,00:50:15.88,00:50:15.88,very rewarding experience. >> Caryn and I had a lot of ups
810,00:50:19.67,00:50:19.67,"and downs, but I actually, genuinely like her as a person."
811,00:50:22.96,00:50:22.96,">> Yeah, me, too. >> I respect her."
812,00:50:24.67,00:50:24.67,">> That's right, with respect. >> I always knew that I could do"
813,00:50:31.46,00:50:31.46,"without material possessions, but this is a whole other"
814,00:50:34.00,00:50:34.00,level. You're in this game.
815,00:50:36.25,00:50:36.25,"It's all-consuming. It's everything, and then the"
816,00:50:40.08,00:50:40.08,torch is snuffed out and you are in another world.
817,00:50:48.12,00:50:48.12,>> This was a really hard one for me.
818,00:50:50.21,00:50:50.21,>> Yeah. >> Jenn was my best girl out
819,00:50:53.79,00:50:53.79,"here. Definitely miss her presence,"
820,00:50:55.75,00:50:55.75,sad to see her go. >> Mm-hmm.
821,00:50:58.50,00:50:58.50,">> Love you, Jenn. >> To a great competitor and"
822,00:51:02.29,00:51:02.29,good person. >> I would definitely say that
823,00:51:06.21,00:51:06.21,I've proved that I am not the girlie-girl that people thought
824,00:51:09.17,00:51:09.17,I was. And I think people really ended
825,00:51:11.25,00:51:11.25,up respecting me and my game. It's been the most amazing
826,00:51:15.12,00:51:15.12,experience I've ever had in my entire life.
827,00:51:28.04,00:51:28.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Last time you're gonna paddle"
828,00:51:32.21,00:51:32.21,to a challenge. First things first.
829,00:51:45.00,00:51:45.00,"For the last time, immunity is up for grabs."
830,00:51:49.17,00:51:49.17,"For your final immunity challenge, you're going to bob"
831,00:51:51.46,00:51:51.46,on a buoy for as long as you can.
832,00:51:55.12,00:51:55.12,Here's how it works-- there are three floating buoys in the
833,00:51:57.46,00:51:57.46,water. Each buoy has a pole to hold
834,00:51:59.58,00:51:59.58,"onto, and a small metal disc to stand on."
835,00:52:03.17,00:52:03.17,Three rules: You cannot sit down on the disc.
836,00:52:07.12,00:52:07.12,You cannot touch any part of the buoy underneath the disc.
837,00:52:10.79,00:52:10.79,And you will do this barefoot. Last person left standing wins
838,00:52:14.04,00:52:14.04,"immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final two and decides"
839,00:52:19.25,00:52:19.25,who sits next to them at that final Tribal Council.
840,00:52:23.00,00:52:23.00,We'll randomly draw for spots and you'll swim out.
841,00:52:29.17,00:52:29.17,"All right, everybody, get up into your standing position on"
842,00:52:33.54,00:52:33.54,the small disc. The final immunity challenge has
843,00:52:39.04,00:52:39.04,begun. >> Whoa.
844,00:52:44.04,00:52:44.04,">> PROBST: Ian, you think this is going to go a while?"
845,00:52:46.17,00:52:46.17,">> I think so. >> PROBST: How 'bout you,"
846,00:52:48.17,00:52:48.17,"Katie? >> Oh, yeah."
847,00:52:49.04,00:52:49.04,>> PROBST: Tom? >> A couple hours.
848,00:52:50.71,00:52:50.71,>> PROBST: I'm guessing nobody is going to willingly
849,00:52:53.12,00:52:53.12,"step down off of this challenge. >> Oh, no."
850,00:52:55.88,00:52:55.88,>> PROBST: Nobody trusts anybody anymore in this group.
851,00:52:58.17,00:52:58.17,>> ( chuckling ) No way. >> Are you kidding me?
852,00:53:11.38,00:53:11.38,>> PROBST: You've been out here one hour.
853,00:53:13.25,00:53:13.25,"What are you thinking about, Katie?"
854,00:53:15.46,00:53:15.46,>> Winning immunity. It'd be a nice one to win.
855,00:53:20.00,00:53:20.00,">> PROBST: How about you, Ian? >> It was a pretty rough night"
856,00:53:22.42,00:53:22.42,"for me last night. So, I'm thinking about a lot of"
857,00:53:26.04,00:53:26.04,stuff. >> Whoa!
858,00:53:37.62,00:53:37.62,>> It's really windy right now. >> Wow.
859,00:53:40.62,00:53:40.62,">> It really is windy, isn't it? >> Yeah."
860,00:53:43.62,00:53:43.62,>> I'm getting really far over. >> PROBST: The wind is
861,00:53:45.62,00:53:45.62,definitely picking up. ( thunder )
862,00:53:55.79,00:53:55.79,>> Wow. >> PROBST: Here comes the rain.
863,00:54:23.00,00:54:23.00,"Tom, is this rain going to make this any more difficult?"
864,00:54:26.08,00:54:26.08,>> Not as difficult as the sun would be.
865,00:54:51.50,00:54:51.50,">> PROBST: How confident are you right now that you can win this,"
866,00:54:54.67,00:54:54.67,Katie? >> Pretty confident if someone
867,00:54:56.21,00:54:56.21,"makes a mistake. >> PROBST: Ian, how confident"
868,00:54:59.21,00:54:59.21,are you that you can win this challenge?
869,00:55:00.58,00:55:00.58,>> Pretty confident. But you never know what's going
870,00:55:04.17,00:55:04.17,to happen. >> PROBST: Think you can beat
871,00:55:06.00,00:55:06.00,Tom? >> Yup.
872,00:55:12.08,00:55:12.08,>> This hurts. I'm not enjoying myself right
873,00:55:14.08,00:55:14.08,now. >> PROBST: What's hurting?
874,00:55:16.42,00:55:16.42,>> My back. >> PROBST: Coming up on five
875,00:55:34.67,00:55:34.67,hours. Katie trying to find a
876,00:55:39.08,00:55:39.08,comfortable spot. >> I'm in a bad way.
877,00:55:48.21,00:55:48.21,"Good luck, you guys. >> PROBST: Katie has just"
878,00:55:52.17,00:55:52.17,"stepped down, taking herself out of the challenge and might have"
879,00:55:55.29,00:55:55.29,just cost herself a shot at a million bucks.
880,00:56:03.67,00:56:03.67,"Tom and Ian, last two left standing, last immunity"
881,00:56:07.79,00:56:07.79,challenge with everything you two have been through.
882,00:56:17.25,00:56:17.25,"What's hurting right now, Tom? >> Everything is numb from the"
883,00:56:20.17,00:56:20.17,"knees down. >> PROBST: How about you, Ian?"
884,00:56:22.50,00:56:22.50,>> Feel pretty good. >> PROBST: I'm amazed that we
885,00:56:53.25,00:56:53.25,have been out here eight hours. >> Whoo-hoo!
886,00:56:54.92,00:56:54.92,>> PROBST: There hasn't been one word spoken in the last four and
887,00:56:58.25,00:56:58.25,a half and never once has even the notion of a deal come up.
888,00:57:03.83,00:57:03.83,">> What, have you got pizza? >> I'm gonna say, are there"
889,00:57:06.33,00:57:06.33,"French fries or something? >> Um, if I beat you at this"
890,00:57:14.25,00:57:14.25,event I'm taking Katie to the final.
891,00:57:18.54,00:57:18.54,"If you step off that perch, I'm taking you."
892,00:57:21.21,00:57:21.21,">> Okay, I won't step off the perch."
893,00:57:22.50,00:57:22.50,>> I think you should take the offer.
894,00:57:27.42,00:57:27.42,">> You're that afraid of going to Tribal against me right now,"
895,00:57:31.46,00:57:31.46,all your persuasive language skills...

897,00:57:36.17,00:57:36.17,">> ( chuckles ) >> Okay, I'll count to three."
898,00:57:39.33,00:57:39.33,">> Yeah, right. >> Come on, Ian."
899,00:57:46.75,00:57:46.75,"Final two. Just step down, and pay a few"
900,00:57:52.50,00:57:52.50,"college loans-- $100,000. That's not chump change."
901,00:57:56.42,00:57:56.42,">> I thought you wanted to duke it out, Tom."
902,00:58:02.29,00:58:02.29,That's why I can't step down. And won't step down.
903,00:59:02.88,00:59:02.88,">> As you know, I've had a, uh... interesting day."
904,00:59:08.00,00:59:08.00,"Um, I'll, uh, I'll go down, you take Katie."
905,00:59:16.79,00:59:16.79,"And I'll give up the million, um, to get back your-your guys'"

911,00:59:34.12,00:59:34.12,">> Yeah. I would do it. >> PROBST: Just to be clear, Tom"
912,00:59:39.83,00:59:39.83,has been offering to take you and give you a shot.
913,00:59:42.25,00:59:42.25,>> Right. >> PROBST: That doesn't sound as
914,00:59:44.92,00:59:44.92,good as taking back your integrity and giving up any
915,00:59:47.50,00:59:47.50,chance. >> That's right.
916,00:59:48.58,00:59:48.58,>> PROBST: And giving somebody who's been out of this challenge
917,00:59:51.21,00:59:51.21,"now for ten hours. >> Yes, I've, I've thought about"
918,00:59:53.54,00:59:53.54,"it for the past 24 hours, how to reconcile my differences."
919,00:59:56.62,00:59:56.62,"My hole gets deeper and deeper. I, I can't leave this game with"
920,01:00:00.42,01:00:00.42,"that on my shoulder, so I will dive right now if you"
921,01:00:04.88,01:00:04.88,take Katie. I said all along the friendship
922,01:00:08.33,01:00:08.33,"was more important, I feel like the longer we sit up here, the"
923,01:00:13.00,01:00:13.00,"more and more I feel like a traitor to that, and a traitor"
924,01:00:16.75,01:00:16.75,"to myself, so, yeah, I'll do it. >> PROBST: Tom, would it be"
925,01:00:20.12,01:00:20.12,successful? Would he be accomplishing what
926,01:00:21.92,01:00:21.92,he's trying to do? >> Without a doubt.
927,01:00:24.33,01:00:24.33,"Ian would have my friendship after this game anyway, but he"
928,01:00:29.00,01:00:29.00,wins my respect back. >> PROBST: Ian steps down.
929,01:00:45.25,01:00:45.25,Tom wins final immunity. Nobody would have predicted this
930,01:01:03.08,01:01:03.08,"move. >> I was about to fall off, too."
931,01:01:13.83,01:01:13.83,"I'm surprised you did that. >> Oh, my God!"
932,01:01:24.00,01:01:24.00,>> PROBST: Put this on. Let me ask you guys something.
933,01:01:33.67,01:01:33.67,"Tom, you have immunity. Is there any reason we shouldn't"
934,01:01:36.54,01:01:36.54,hold Tribal Council right now? >> I'm going to ask Ian one more
935,01:01:39.83,01:01:39.83,time because I think we're both a little punchy and delirious.
936,01:01:46.21,01:01:46.21,"Are you taking yourself out, and-and do you want me to hold"
937,01:01:49.54,01:01:49.54,to that? >> We made a deal.
938,01:01:52.33,01:01:52.33,"Yeah, absolutely, yeah. You guys need to go"
939,01:01:54.38,01:01:54.38,"to the final two. >> PROBST: All right, here's"
940,01:01:56.38,01:01:56.38,what's going to happen. The only person who votes is
941,01:01:59.04,01:01:59.04,you. Give me a verbal vote.
942,01:02:02.12,01:02:02.12,Who are you voting out of this game tonight?
943,01:02:07.75,01:02:07.75,">> Uh, I'm going to vote out my buddy Ian."
944,01:02:11.08,01:02:11.08,"And as bad as I felt last night, I feel ten times better."
945,01:02:15.92,01:02:15.92,"Um, he's just a hell of a guy, and I respect him."
946,01:02:23.58,01:02:23.58,">> PROBST: Ian, you are the 16th person voted out of this game."
947,01:02:27.33,01:02:27.33,"You'll become the seventh member of the jury, with,"
948,01:02:30.00,01:02:30.00,"potentially, a very big vote. So, Tom, Katie, you two are the"
949,01:02:35.67,01:02:35.67,final two. You have one more night here in
950,01:02:38.75,01:02:38.75,"Palau. Tomorrow night, we will hold our"
951,01:02:40.71,01:02:40.71,final Tribal Council. You two will get in your
952,01:02:42.71,01:02:42.71,"outrigger, head back to the beach."
953,01:02:44.29,01:02:44.29,"Ian, you'll stay here with me. I'll get you to the jury."
954,01:02:46.33,01:02:46.33,"Good night. >> All right, I'm going to tell"
955,01:03:21.54,01:03:21.54,you a dream I had. You tell me your dream.
956,01:03:24.21,01:03:24.21,Let's find out if it really happened.
957,01:03:28.29,01:03:28.29,"I don't see anybody else here in camp, and I had a dream that you"
958,01:03:31.75,01:03:31.75,and I are the final two. Is it possible?
959,01:03:34.62,01:03:34.62,>> It's possible. It's day 39.
960,01:03:38.83,01:03:38.83,">> Day 39. >> Oh, my gosh."
961,01:03:41.58,01:03:41.58,Can you believe it? >> The time is almost here.
962,01:03:44.42,01:03:44.42,>> Yes. >> One more day here.
963,01:03:47.42,01:03:47.42,">> Whoo! That was the last night, Tom!"
964,01:03:50.38,01:03:50.38,>> That was it. >> I woke up this morning and I
965,01:03:54.08,01:03:54.08,"was, like, ""Oh, my God! This is it, this is our last"
966,01:03:57.08,01:03:57.08,"day. ""Wait, it's just Tom and I."
967,01:03:59.50,01:03:59.50,"Wait, I made it to the final two."""
968,01:04:01.25,01:04:01.25,">> Katie, that's a good testament to you."
969,01:04:03.54,01:04:03.54,"It's been 39 days, but I know I'll miss you tomorrow,"
970,01:04:06.33,01:04:06.33,"when we're not doing this again, so...."
971,01:04:08.12,01:04:08.12,">> Yeah. >> Katie is so likable, and"
972,01:04:13.04,01:04:13.04,"she's such a character, that, you know, you just don't know"
973,01:04:16.58,01:04:16.58,"if people just say, you know what?"
974,01:04:18.62,01:04:18.62,I've had enough of Tom and his immunity necklace.
975,01:04:20.62,01:04:20.62,I'm going to give it to the one who was able to make it there
976,01:04:23.96,01:04:23.96,just by riding with Tom. To be here today as one of the
977,01:04:31.21,01:04:31.21,final two is almost disconnecting.
978,01:04:34.08,01:04:34.08,"I'm, you know, really having trouble, um... processing it."
979,01:04:39.58,01:04:39.58,It's like I'm kind of numb to the whole thing right now.
980,01:04:45.92,01:04:45.92,Final Tribal Council is tonight.
981,01:04:48.29,01:04:48.29,We won't be back to this beach. This is our last day here.
982,01:04:52.08,01:04:52.08,"And, uh, you know, it's bittersweet."
983,01:04:54.08,01:04:54.08,"It's-it's... it's been tough here, but it's"
984,01:04:56.46,01:04:56.46,"been the experience of a lifetime and, uh..."
985,01:05:00.04,01:05:00.04,I think we're going to take this place apart with a little lump
986,01:05:03.00,01:05:03.00,"in our throat. >> Right, whoever wins gets"
987,01:05:04.83,01:05:04.83,"that, right? >> Is that right?"
988,01:05:06.71,01:05:06.71,">> Yeah. >> Okay, good enough."
989,01:05:10.71,01:05:10.71,"Ready? One, two, three. We're going to get a good"
990,01:05:16.25,01:05:16.25,"bonfire going, and it'll be a celebratory bonfire, and the"
991,01:05:19.17,01:05:19.17,"picnic table won't be used by any other tribe, or family"
992,01:05:23.67,01:05:23.67,gathering. That's... it fed this
993,01:05:25.33,01:05:25.33,"tribe, this family, and, uh... it's a great day to be here."
994,01:05:31.79,01:05:31.79,( both whooping ) >> Careful.
995,01:05:40.04,01:05:40.04,I'm telling the fireman to be careful around the fire.
996,01:05:46.17,01:05:46.17,>> That's good advice. >> I played this game in a
997,01:05:49.08,01:05:49.08,"different way than Tom, but just as hard."
998,01:05:53.88,01:05:53.88,There's this scary beast in there-- inside Tom.
999,01:05:57.25,01:05:57.25,"He's threatening, he's intimidating."
1000,01:06:00.54,01:06:00.54,"I, once again, will be candid, and let the jury know, you know,"
1001,01:06:03.67,01:06:03.67,"what Tom has been up to, and what kind of steps that he took"
1002,01:06:07.12,01:06:07.12,to keep himself in the game. ( whistling )
1003,01:06:11.42,01:06:11.42,"Good-bye, coconuts, cemetery. >> Good-bye, coconut, is right."
1004,01:06:15.88,01:06:15.88,">> Bye, rats. >> We're done with that."
1005,01:06:19.21,01:06:19.21,"That's it, the rats get it back now."
1006,01:06:33.42,01:06:33.42,">> I'm really proud of myself for getting through this, and I"
1007,01:06:36.62,01:06:36.62,hope people can appreciate the game for what it is.
1008,01:06:40.29,01:06:40.29,I hope I get some credit for the way that I played this
1009,01:06:43.83,01:06:43.83,"game, and the choices that I've made."
1010,01:06:49.25,01:06:49.25,>> The jury tonight-- no treachery or half-truths or
1011,01:06:51.38,01:06:51.38,sugarcoating things. Whatever I did got me to where
1012,01:06:56.29,01:06:56.29,"I am right now and, uh, so be it."
1013,01:07:00.79,01:07:00.79,"Now it's in their hands, not mine."
1014,01:07:40.38,01:07:40.38,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of your jury--
1015,01:07:44.12,01:07:44.12,"Coby, Janu, Steph, Gregg, Caryn and Jenn."
1016,01:07:52.83,01:07:52.83,We'll now bring in the last member of our jury-- Ian-- voted
1017,01:07:56.92,01:07:56.92,out at an impromptu Tribal Council last night.
1018,01:08:00.50,01:08:00.50,"All right, we have a lot to get to tonight, so let's get"
1019,01:08:02.50,01:08:02.50,started. 39 days you slugged it out in
1020,01:08:06.00,01:08:06.00,"this game, and now all the power shifts to seven people that you"
1021,01:08:09.38,01:08:09.38,"had a hand, either directly or indirectly, in voting out of"
1022,01:08:12.38,01:08:12.38,this game. They now hold your fate in their
1023,01:08:16.12,01:08:16.12,"hands. Tonight, they will question you."
1024,01:08:18.29,01:08:18.29,They will hold you accountable for your actions out here.
1025,01:08:21.17,01:08:21.17,"And, based on what you tell them, they will vote."
1026,01:08:23.88,01:08:23.88,"Here's how it's going to work. Tom and Katie, you will get a"
1027,01:08:26.42,01:08:26.42,chance to make an opening statement.
1028,01:08:28.08,01:08:28.08,This is your chance to pitch them on why you deserve the
1029,01:08:30.92,01:08:30.92,title of Sole Survivor and $1 million.
1030,01:08:33.67,01:08:33.67,"After you've made your comments, they'll get their first chance"
1031,01:08:37.12,01:08:37.12,to address you since being voted out.
1032,01:08:38.79,01:08:38.79,"Once they've had their say, you'll get a chance for a"
1033,01:08:42.12,01:08:42.12,"closing comment, and then we will vote-- sound good?"
1034,01:08:45.75,01:08:45.75,"Let's get started. Tom, you're up first."
1035,01:08:49.08,01:08:49.08,">> Okay. Um, it's an honor to be sitting"
1036,01:08:53.21,01:08:53.21,"in front of what has been our tribe, and our family"
1037,01:08:57.00,01:08:57.00,"for the last couple of weeks, and I don't sit here pretending"
1038,01:09:00.17,01:09:00.17,"that I deserve this seat any more than you, there's a million"
1039,01:09:03.46,01:09:03.46,"things I do want to say, and you can ask me things,"
1040,01:09:06.12,01:09:06.12,"and we'll get to specifics, but judge me on who I was,"
1041,01:09:09.33,01:09:09.33,"the fact that I came out, I played real hard, tried to"
1042,01:09:12.71,01:09:12.71,"provide, went out, did my work, and never had a nasty word"
1043,01:09:16.04,01:09:16.04,"for any of you, and tried to keep it light."
1044,01:09:19.29,01:09:19.29,"It's been an honor, and this is humbling, and I cherish you"
1045,01:09:23.33,01:09:23.33,people for going through this experience with me.
1046,01:09:28.33,01:09:28.33,>> PROBST: Katie. >> Okay.
1047,01:09:30.00,01:09:30.00,"Um, what I would like to say is that there's two very different"
1048,01:09:33.38,01:09:33.38,"people sitting here. Um, I'm not going to pretend"
1049,01:09:38.96,01:09:38.96,that I am even close to Tom in some aspects.
1050,01:09:42.58,01:09:42.58,"The whole goal of this game is self-preservation, and that's"
1051,01:09:45.21,01:09:45.21,"what I've, that's what I've done."
1052,01:09:48.17,01:09:48.17,"I never sat here and had immunity around my neck,"
1053,01:09:51.17,01:09:51.17,but I'm sitting here right now. I'm sure a lot of you are
1054,01:09:54.88,01:09:54.88,"probably thinking, ""Yeah, she skated by."""
1055,01:09:56.67,01:09:56.67,"""She aligned with two really strong people."""
1056,01:09:58.04,01:09:58.04,"Well, that's the game. That's exactly what I did, and I"
1057,01:10:01.04,01:10:01.04,"came in with a plan, and, um, I executed that plan, and I hope I"
1058,01:10:05.12,01:10:05.12,really didn't hurt anyone and everyone can understand that and
1059,01:10:07.96,01:10:07.96,"respect that, that I played the only cards I can play."
1060,01:10:11.71,01:10:11.71,"By far if I can say anything, I definitely outwitted, and I'm"
1061,01:10:14.67,01:10:14.67,just honored to be sitting here right now.
1062,01:10:18.46,01:10:18.46,">> PROBST: Thanks, Katie. All right, jury, in a moment,"
1063,01:10:22.12,01:10:22.12,you're going to get your first chance to address Tom and Katie.
1064,01:10:25.42,01:10:25.42,I'll give you a minute to think about what you want to say
1065,01:10:27.96,01:10:27.96,"or what you want to ask. >> PROBST: All right, Tom,"
1066,01:10:55.17,01:10:55.17,"Katie, you've made your opening statements, it's now time for"
1067,01:10:57.83,01:10:57.83,"the jury to address you. Coby, you're up first."
1068,01:11:03.21,01:11:03.21,"( Coby exhales ) >> Hi, you guys..."
1069,01:11:08.25,01:11:08.25,">> Hi, Coby. >> Hi, Coby."
1070,01:11:10.42,01:11:10.42,>> So this is going to be serious.
1071,01:11:12.33,01:11:12.33,"I have issues, I'm bringing them."
1072,01:11:14.46,01:11:14.46,">> Bring them on. >> Bring it on, Coby."
1073,01:11:16.79,01:11:16.79,">> I respect the fact that I was outplayed by the two of you, but"
1074,01:11:20.21,01:11:20.21,that doesn't mean that I have to respect the way either of you
1075,01:11:23.33,01:11:23.33,"played the game. So, Katie... Ooh, you're making this hard"
1076,01:11:26.25,01:11:26.25,"with that little grin, but the fact of the matter is, is that"
1077,01:11:29.92,01:11:29.92,if you get my vote tonight-- and I need to make this clear-- it's
1078,01:11:33.67,01:11:33.67,"not for how you played the game, because in the challenges, you"
1079,01:11:36.96,01:11:36.96,"sat out of most of them. At camp, I rarely saw you muster"
1080,01:11:43.79,01:11:43.79,enough energy but to stir coconut.
1081,01:11:47.17,01:11:47.17,Your self-proclaimed social skills really don't lie anywhere
1082,01:11:49.38,01:11:49.38,outside of your alliance. The only quality that I actually
1083,01:11:55.50,01:11:55.50,saw you bring to this game was maybe the value of riding the
1084,01:11:58.54,01:11:58.54,coattails of people who do play the game.
1085,01:12:00.12,01:12:00.12,"So realize, if I vote for you tonight, it is not for you, but"
1086,01:12:04.88,01:12:04.88,it is against Tom. Which brings me to Tom.
1087,01:12:10.12,01:12:10.12,"My main problem with how you played this game, Tom, is that"
1088,01:12:13.25,01:12:13.25,"you played this game almost as dirty as I would have liked to,"
1089,01:12:18.08,01:12:18.08,"and you played this game every bit as dirty as Ian did, whether"
1090,01:12:21.04,01:12:21.04,you want to admit it or not. And I've seen you come into
1091,01:12:24.17,01:12:24.17,"every Tribal Council, you dance around some of your lies, and"
1092,01:12:27.08,01:12:27.08,"you skirt around your issues, and you're very good at it, I'll"
1093,01:12:30.08,01:12:30.08,"give you that, but I'm not buying it."
1094,01:12:32.29,01:12:32.29,"So tonight is your chance, if you want my vote, to finally"
1095,01:12:35.62,01:12:35.62,bring out that badge of courage that you wave of honesty and
1096,01:12:38.88,01:12:38.88,"truth, and I want to hear it. So I am now going to sit down,"
1097,01:12:44.04,01:12:44.04,"and I'm going to listen to every word you say, and you know that"
1098,01:12:48.12,01:12:48.12,with every word it could cost you a million dollars.
1099,01:12:54.50,01:12:54.50,">> PROBST: Gregg. >> Uh, my first comment and"
1100,01:13:02.25,01:13:02.25,"question is for Tom. When Koror was a tribe of seven,"
1101,01:13:05.92,01:13:05.92,"you didn't have immunity. You were at risk, and you were"
1102,01:13:09.04,01:13:09.04,"pretty nervous about it. You and I had a conversation,"
1103,01:13:12.08,01:13:12.08,"once or twice actually, about how anyone that would break the"
1104,01:13:15.08,01:13:15.08,five-person alliance would have to pay for it when it came to
1105,01:13:18.12,01:13:18.12,"the jury. Well, here I am today, I'm part"
1106,01:13:22.62,01:13:22.62,"of the jury, and, you know, I kept my word."
1107,01:13:26.42,01:13:26.42,"I saved you, and you didn't do the same."
1108,01:13:29.88,01:13:29.88,"You didn't pay the same respect. So why, why on Earth should I"
1109,01:13:33.58,01:13:33.58,"give you my vote? >> Gregg, when I voted you out,"
1110,01:13:38.00,01:13:38.00,I did think that you had threatened me; I believed it.
1111,01:13:40.33,01:13:40.33,I apologize for that. I was taken in because I didn't
1112,01:13:43.54,01:13:43.54,"think I had any reason to doubt Ian, but when he came and said,"
1113,01:13:47.17,01:13:47.17,"""You're the next to go because you're winning too many things,"""
1114,01:13:50.17,01:13:50.17,"I believed him, and I apologize to you for that."
1115,01:13:52.62,01:13:52.62,>> Regrets? >> Totally. I was taken in.
1116,01:13:55.67,01:13:55.67,"Let me tell you, I can't believe that I had the number played on"
1117,01:13:59.25,01:13:59.25,"me that I did. Um, total regrets."
1118,01:14:03.17,01:14:03.17,">> Katie, you were... worthless around camp."
1119,01:14:08.83,01:14:08.83,"You were insignificant, even embarrassing on challenges."
1120,01:14:12.04,01:14:12.04,"You would think that the least that you could do was, you know,"
1121,01:14:16.08,01:14:16.08,make some friends around camp. Yet I still can count a number
1122,01:14:19.33,01:14:19.33,"of instances where you've ridiculed, made fun of almost"
1123,01:14:21.88,01:14:21.88,"all these jury members, and even betrayed them at times."
1124,01:14:26.96,01:14:26.96,"So my question to you is, explain to me and the jury how"
1125,01:14:30.38,01:14:30.38,"being so pathetic is your ""plan""-- and not your plan to"
1126,01:14:33.33,01:14:33.33,get an invite to number two-- but a plan to win you a million
1127,01:14:37.08,01:14:37.08,"dollars. >> Wow, Gregg. Um..."
1128,01:14:44.17,01:14:44.17,I don't even know where to begin with that.
1129,01:14:47.12,01:14:47.12,"I'm-I'm really sorry that you feel like I'm pathetic, um, and"
1130,01:14:50.08,01:14:50.08,"I'm sorry you had to go there, because I would never say"
1131,01:14:53.38,01:14:53.38,"anything like that about you, um, because you're not, and"
1132,01:14:56.25,01:14:56.25,"I'm-- I don't think I am either, you know."
1133,01:15:01.29,01:15:01.29,I played with the cards that I have.
1134,01:15:03.04,01:15:03.04,I don't have an athletic card. I'm sorry if you feel like I was
1135,01:15:07.00,01:15:07.00,"pathetic, but that's not all this game is about."
1136,01:15:09.75,01:15:09.75,"It's about getting here, and going in with a strategy, and I"
1137,01:15:13.12,01:15:13.12,"have never wavered on that strategy, ever."
1138,01:15:16.38,01:15:16.38,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Thanks, Gregg."
1139,01:15:21.67,01:15:21.67,"Steph. >> Well, congratulations to both"
1140,01:15:28.62,01:15:28.62,"of you for making it this far. Tom, I get to Koror on Day 22,"
1141,01:15:36.17,01:15:36.17,"and you take me aside, you tell me, um, I'm not a dead man"
1142,01:15:40.12,01:15:40.12,walking... and that you'll do whatever you
1143,01:15:42.83,01:15:42.83,can to take me as far as you can because you know that I deserve
1144,01:15:46.21,01:15:46.21,"it, and that you'll fight for me."
1145,01:15:48.04,01:15:48.04,"And, unfortunately, I don't think you fought at all or hard"
1146,01:15:51.00,01:15:51.00,enough because I'm not the one sitting next to you.
1147,01:15:54.42,01:15:54.42,"So what I kind of want to know is, you know..."
1148,01:15:57.88,01:15:57.88,"when my name was brought up at camp, what did you do to"
1149,01:16:01.21,01:16:01.21,"fight for me, and I don't want to hear it was strategy or it"
1150,01:16:04.62,01:16:04.62,was a numbers game. I want to hear specific things.
1151,01:16:07.71,01:16:07.71,">> Um, I went as far as I could, and then it came to the"
1152,01:16:11.04,01:16:11.04,five-person alliance. I couldn't step forward and just
1153,01:16:13.46,01:16:13.46,"say, ""No, no, no, Stephenie, it's got to be Stephenie."""
1154,01:16:16.58,01:16:16.58,"So to preserve the alliance that I was in, I had to acquiesce,"
1155,01:16:19.79,01:16:19.79,"and I did say, ""Okay, it's Stephenie."""
1156,01:16:21.79,01:16:21.79,"For me to lose my alliance and still not save you from, uh,"
1157,01:16:25.21,01:16:25.21,from getting voted off just didn't make any sense within
1158,01:16:28.04,01:16:28.04,this game. >> Okay.
1159,01:16:32.21,01:16:32.21,"And, Katie, what I want to know from you is why should I"
1160,01:16:36.08,01:16:36.08,not vote for Tom? >> I really was hoping that this
1161,01:16:40.25,01:16:40.25,wouldn't be as ugly as it was. I guess it has to get that way.
1162,01:16:44.54,01:16:44.54,Tom actually came to me before you came and said we need to
1163,01:16:48.21,01:16:48.21,take out Stephenie. You pulled me aside and you
1164,01:16:50.96,01:16:50.96,"said, ""Whether it's Stephenie or Bobby Jon, we gotta take 'em"
1165,01:16:54.25,01:16:54.25,"out, and we need to take 'em out first."""
1166,01:16:56.12,01:16:56.12,">> Why would I tell a person, who maybe had an alliance with"
1167,01:16:59.54,01:16:59.54,"the four of us-- Ian, myself, Katie-- that we had to get rid"
1168,01:17:03.00,01:17:03.00,of you? You were an ace in the hole that
1169,01:17:05.25,01:17:05.25,was the last person I wanted to see voted off.
1170,01:17:07.75,01:17:07.75,There's no sense to that at all. >> I swear I remember that
1171,01:17:11.67,01:17:11.67,conversation. >> PROBST: Satisfied?
1172,01:17:15.50,01:17:15.50,>> Perfect. >> PROBST: Thanks.
1173,01:17:17.25,01:17:17.25,">> Thanks, guys. >> PROBST: Janu."
1174,01:17:23.25,01:17:23.25,">> Well, okay. Tom, I'll address you first."
1175,01:17:27.29,01:17:27.29,"Now, you being the man that you are, tell me how hard was it"
1176,01:17:31.04,01:17:31.04,to compromise your integrity to be in this game and to get as
1177,01:17:34.67,01:17:34.67,"far as you did, and how do you reconcile that?"
1178,01:17:39.12,01:17:39.12,">> This game is what it is, and we all know the rules, and"
1179,01:17:42.96,01:17:42.96,there are lines that we each have to individually draw and
1180,01:17:45.88,01:17:45.88,choose whether or not we cross over them.
1181,01:17:49.50,01:17:49.50,I didn't get to any of those lines and cross them and-and
1182,01:17:52.75,01:17:52.75,have that problem. I played the game as well as I
1183,01:17:55.75,01:17:55.75,can. I played it with as much honor
1184,01:17:57.96,01:17:57.96,"as I can. I mean, you cannot play"
1185,01:18:00.08,01:18:00.08,"Survivor and not mislead, misdirect."
1186,01:18:02.62,01:18:02.62,"I went out of my way to never hurt people,"
1187,01:18:05.79,01:18:05.79,but the real goal was to get myself into this seat and to be
1188,01:18:09.54,01:18:09.54,"judged by how I played the game, and I welcome that chance now."
1189,01:18:13.67,01:18:13.67,">> PROBST: As the rain comes down, Janu, address Katie."
1190,01:18:16.08,01:18:16.08,">> I will now go to Katie. My question to you, Katie, is if"
1191,01:18:20.29,01:18:20.29,you could please give me three positive and negative
1192,01:18:25.04,01:18:25.04,adjectives that best describe you and how you played this
1193,01:18:27.62,01:18:27.62,game. >> Actually...
1194,01:18:33.92,01:18:33.92,"I don't expect your vote, Janu. So I don't know that I need to"
1195,01:18:38.25,01:18:38.25,"do that, to give you positive and negative."
1196,01:18:41.33,01:18:41.33,"I mean, I can I do that if you need me to, but I don't expect"
1197,01:18:45.42,01:18:45.42,your vote. >> You're assuming that you
1198,01:18:47.29,01:18:47.29,don't have my vote. >> Right.
1199,01:18:48.92,01:18:48.92,">> You don't know this, but if you're willing to sit back and"
1200,01:18:51.88,01:18:51.88,"not answer my question, then so be it, and I'll return to the"
1201,01:18:54.92,01:18:54.92,jury. Fair enough then.
1202,01:19:00.54,01:19:00.54,"Okay, thank you, both. >> PROBST: Thanks, Janu."
1203,01:19:06.79,01:19:06.79,">> Caryn. >> Tom, my question to you is"
1204,01:19:13.79,01:19:13.79,"simple: What was I to you in the game, Tom?"
1205,01:19:18.96,01:19:18.96,"Was I just a pawn? Did we have a legitimate, real,"
1206,01:19:24.08,01:19:24.08,genuine friendship? >> I didn't tell you you were in
1207,01:19:28.92,01:19:28.92,"an alliance. I never lied to you and said,"
1208,01:19:31.25,01:19:31.25,"""Caryn, you're in."" I told you, ""We're the parents"
1209,01:19:34.21,01:19:34.21,"of this dysfunctional family. ""You know, we should look out"
1210,01:19:38.33,01:19:38.33,"for each other's backs."" I did it for you, and now I"
1211,01:19:40.79,01:19:40.79,found out you did it for me. I thought that you were lying
1212,01:19:43.54,01:19:43.54,to me. I didn't believe you.
1213,01:19:45.17,01:19:45.17,I thought it was game-play. I thought that you were stirring
1214,01:19:48.17,01:19:48.17,"up a hornet's nest, saying that people said things."
1215,01:19:50.75,01:19:50.75,It nearly cost me the game. If I didn't win those two
1216,01:19:54.17,01:19:54.17,"back-to-back immunities, I was going home."
1217,01:19:55.62,01:19:55.62,">> So was I a pawn, or did we have a real friendship?"
1218,01:19:57.62,01:19:57.62,>> If you were a pawn... >> Within the confines of this
1219,01:19:59.62,01:19:59.62,game... >> You know what?
1220,01:20:00.71,01:20:00.71,>> Was it legitimate and genuine-- what we were saying
1221,01:20:02.71,01:20:02.71,to each other or was I a pawn? >> I'll tell you what.
1222,01:20:04.71,01:20:04.71,I won't even answer that question.
1223,01:20:06.54,01:20:06.54,"I'm going to let you find that for yourself in your heart,"
1224,01:20:08.54,01:20:08.54,okay? >> Okay. Fair enough.
1225,01:20:10.54,01:20:10.54,"Katie, I'm going to tell you the things I did observe, okay?"
1226,01:20:15.08,01:20:15.08,You were phony and cruel to everyone except Tom and Ian.
1227,01:20:20.25,01:20:20.25,"Aside from that, I also observed: laziest person at"
1228,01:20:22.54,01:20:22.54,"camp, mean, bad at challenges, unkind and betrayed me."
1229,01:20:29.58,01:20:29.58,Give me one reason I should vote for you.
1230,01:20:32.38,01:20:32.38,">> Um, well, Caryn, I'm sorry if you think I'm unkind."
1231,01:20:38.08,01:20:38.08,"I'm not unkind, but, you know, whatever you want to think"
1232,01:20:42.04,01:20:42.04,"about me personally, um, is your own prerogative."
1233,01:20:45.00,01:20:45.00,"If you don't vote for me, Caryn, it's not going to change how you"
1234,01:20:48.12,01:20:48.12,"feel about me as a person. Obviously, that is ruling how"
1235,01:20:50.75,01:20:50.75,you're making your judgments on me.
1236,01:20:53.25,01:20:53.25,">> No, the question was, Katie, these are the things I observed."
1237,01:20:56.46,01:20:56.46,">> I understand. >> Okay, tell me if there's"
1238,01:20:58.42,01:20:58.42,"something, other than making an alliance with two strong people"
1239,01:21:01.25,01:21:01.25,who carried you that I'm missing.
1240,01:21:04.08,01:21:04.08,">> That the game is about making alliances, and that's why you're"
1241,01:21:06.71,01:21:06.71,"sitting over there, because you didn't make one."
1242,01:21:08.38,01:21:08.38,">> I got it, Katie, thanks. >> PROBST: Jenn."
1243,01:21:17.71,01:21:17.71,">> Congratulations, you guys. Um... Okay..."
1244,01:21:21.50,01:21:21.50,"Tom, my take on you is that you are, uh, in my mind,"
1245,01:21:25.25,01:21:25.25,a little chauvinistic. I believe that you didn't
1246,01:21:29.29,01:21:29.29,"respect me or my game. Um, I am a woman with a vote,"
1247,01:21:33.21,01:21:33.21,and I would like to know why I should give you the respect of
1248,01:21:36.92,01:21:36.92,my vote when I don't believe that you respected me or my
1249,01:21:40.17,01:21:40.17,"game. >> Sure, um, my respect for your"
1250,01:21:44.21,01:21:44.21,"game, I'll agree, came late. When you came up and told me,"
1251,01:21:49.17,01:21:49.17,"ask him right now in front of me, were you going to vote Tom"
1252,01:21:53.00,01:21:53.00,"out the last two days, confront Ian right now, and I did, then I"
1253,01:21:56.54,01:21:56.54,"said, ""Hey, you're really playing hard and I do respect"
1254,01:21:59.04,01:21:59.04,"it."" So your whole game was that you"
1255,01:22:03.50,01:22:03.50,hid your game. I had no game to see.
1256,01:22:07.21,01:22:07.21,">> Okay, Katie, to me, what's, what's worse than being"
1257,01:22:09.75,01:22:09.75,disrespected is being someone who just gets disrespected over
1258,01:22:15.92,01:22:15.92,and over and just takes it and lies down.
1259,01:22:20.33,01:22:20.33,"You know, I think you had opportunity after opportunity"
1260,01:22:23.21,01:22:23.21,"to play this game like a strong woman, and I just want to know,"
1261,01:22:26.88,01:22:26.88,"am I wrong? I mean, did you play it like a"
1262,01:22:28.62,01:22:28.62,"strong woman, like, or a doormat?"
1263,01:22:31.21,01:22:31.21,">> Um, by preserving myself and my alliance, I believe that"
1264,01:22:34.08,01:22:34.08,"makes me a strong person, by realizing how-how to play"
1265,01:22:36.67,01:22:36.67,"this game, how to get where you get to."
1266,01:22:40.96,01:22:40.96,"I mean, you make sacrifices. I'm not here to, um, prove that"
1267,01:22:44.12,01:22:44.12,I'm a strong woman. I-I believe that I'm a strong
1268,01:22:48.04,01:22:48.04,"woman. Um, by me sticking to my plan,"
1269,01:22:50.75,01:22:50.75,"um, and my-my strategy, yeah, I feel, I feel good about my game."
1270,01:22:56.17,01:22:56.17,">> Okay. Okay. Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Jenn."
1271,01:23:01.71,01:23:01.71,Ian. >> Yeah.
1272,01:23:07.88,01:23:07.88,"Uh, answer as honestly as you can."
1273,01:23:10.71,01:23:10.71,It's gonna be the same question for both of you.
1274,01:23:12.54,01:23:12.54,"Um, what's the biggest reason that we, as a group, shouldn't"
1275,01:23:15.50,01:23:15.50,give you a million dollars? Katie can go first.
1276,01:23:20.12,01:23:20.12,">> Um, the biggest reason would be because you felt that because"
1277,01:23:23.21,01:23:23.21,"of my personality, because of my sense of humor,"
1278,01:23:28.46,01:23:28.46,"which I thought a lot of people got a kick out of, if that's"

1315,01:25:53.08,01:25:53.08,was my biggest threat because he's such a stand-up guy.

1317,01:25:59.71,01:25:59.71,That's why I aligned with him. That's why I aligned with Ian.
1318,01:26:02.08,01:26:02.08,"My plea to you guys is give me a chance, you know?"

1325,01:26:22.71,01:26:22.71,self-respect; I might not be leaving with
