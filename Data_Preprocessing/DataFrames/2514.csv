286,00:18:40.00,00:18:40.00,"VERY HESITANT TO MAKE ANY KIND OF COMMITMENT, SO FOR ME,"

288,00:18:47.03,00:18:47.03,"PLANNED TOW HARD TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A FOUR, MAKES ME VERY LEERY"
289,00:18:52.30,00:18:52.30,ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON KEEPING ME IN THE FINAL THREE.
290,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,SO THIS IS KIND OF SCRAMBLE TIME.
291,00:18:55.87,00:18:55.87,I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN AND FIGURE IT OUT FAST.
292,00:19:04.40,00:19:04.40,>> I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TO TALK TO

295,00:19:13.53,00:19:13.53,I'M GETTING FLASH BACKS TO PENNER.
296,00:19:15.47,00:19:15.47,"LIKE, ""MALCOLM, ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENT FOR FINAL"

303,00:19:35.63,00:19:35.63,HE HAS THE PHYSICAL GAME. HE HAS THE SOCIAL GAME.
304,00:19:41.70,00:19:41.70,"IF YOU GUYS ARE ON BOARD, IT IS POSSIBLE."
305,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,>> PERFECT. TODAY HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY.
306,00:19:46.00,00:19:46.00,I JUST FOUND OUT DENISE IS WILLING TO TURN ON MALCOLM AND

308,00:19:52.27,00:19:52.27,SHE REALIZES SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST HIM.
309,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,NONE OF US DO. SO THIS IS FABULOUS.
310,00:20:00.53,00:20:00.53,"MALCOLM IS THE KIND OF GUY WHO WILL PUT HIS ARM AROUND YOU, AND"
311,00:20:04.50,00:20:04.50,STAB YOU. >> STAB YOU.

322,00:20:30.50,00:20:30.50,DIDN'T GIVE HER MY WORD BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SKUPIN IS

343,00:21:41.80,00:21:41.80,SO I CAN BEAT HIM. I'M NOT SAYING I WILL.
344,00:21:45.37,00:21:45.37,I'M SAYING I THINK I CAN BEAT HIM.
345,00:21:46.90,00:21:46.90,"YOU KNOW, THE WORD ON THE STREET IS MALCOLM'S UNBEATABLE, AND HE"

348,00:21:55.77,00:21:55.77,I THINK I CAN BEAT MALCOLM. AND I THINK I CAN TELL A PRETTY
349,00:21:59.70,00:21:59.70,GOOD STORY AT THE END. SO I JUST HAVE TO KEEP MY COOL
350,00:22:04.90,00:22:04.90,AND FIGURE OUT WHO I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO IN THE FINALLY BECAUSE
351,00:22:09.33,00:22:09.33,THAT'S THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION RIGHT THERE.
352,00:22:35.50,00:22:35.50,"A CRAZY DAY. DENISE IS REALLY WORKING IT,"
353,00:22:38.27,00:22:38.27,RIGHT? WE CAN'T CONTROL JURY VOTES BUT
354,00:22:41.90,00:22:41.90,WE CAN CONTROL WHERE WE SIT. SO WE JUST CAN'T LET HER WIN.
355,00:22:46.63,00:22:46.63,SHE HASN'T WON ANYTHING-- >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE CAN'T LET
356,00:22:50.77,00:22:50.77,HER WIN. WE HAVE TO LET HER WIN.
357,00:22:52.73,00:22:52.73,SHE'S THE ONE WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING.
358,00:22:55.60,00:22:55.60,SHE HASN'T PLAYED THE GAME. SHE LET MALCOLM PLAY FOR HER.
359,00:23:00.27,00:23:00.27,I USED TO HATE IT WHEN ABI SAID I NEED TO KEEP MIKEOLE A LEASH
360,00:23:05.03,00:23:05.03,BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO BE LEVEL HEADED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
361,00:23:08.40,00:23:08.40,"STRATEGIC MOVES, AND SOMETIMES SKUPIN IS NOT THAT LEVEL HEADED."

627,00:43:55.93,00:43:55.93,I NEEDED TO WIN THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE TO GUARANTEE MY SPOT
628,00:44:00.37,00:44:00.37,FOR THE FINAL THREE BUT THE MINUTE I GET NERVOUS AROUND A
629,00:44:03.33,00:44:03.33,GIRL OR ANYTHING MY HANDS START SHAKING AND WHEN I SAW MY HANDS
630,00:44:08.20,00:44:08.20,SHAKING IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.
631,00:44:11.07,00:44:11.07,IT'S A DISCONCERTING SCENARIO BECAUSE MY FATE NOW RESTS WITH
632,00:44:16.10,00:44:16.10,LISA AND SKUPIN. >> YOU BEAT HIM.
633,00:44:18.17,00:44:18.17,>> RIGHT WHEN WE NEEDED IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID IT.

637,00:44:37.70,00:44:37.70,"CLOSE. MR. SKUPIN, WELL DONE."
638,00:44:39.03,00:44:39.03,>> YEAH. NOW THERE'S A TON OF STRATEGY.

640,00:44:47.33,00:44:47.33,CAN YOU GET THEIR VOTE? AND IT'S UP TO ME TO MAKE THAT
641,00:44:50.10,00:44:50.10,"DECISION. >> WE'RE ALL COOL, YES?"
642,00:44:52.70,00:44:52.70,I'M SO SCARED. I'VE HAD A NECKLACE FOR THE PAST
643,00:44:56.17,00:44:56.17,WEEK. AND I DON'T HAVE ONE.
644,00:44:59.27,00:44:59.27,SHE'S GOING TO WANT YOU ALL TO THROW VOTES AT ME.
645,00:45:01.87,00:45:01.87,>> SHOULD WE JUST GO ALONG WITH HER AND SAY YEAH?
646,00:45:04.73,00:45:04.73,">> NO! >> NO, NO, I'M SAYING TO SAY IT."
647,00:45:08.07,00:45:08.07,">> IF WE'RE ALL GOOD, I DON'T CARE."
648,00:45:11.40,00:45:11.40,THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME IN THIS GAME I HAVEN'T BEEN

650,00:45:18.33,00:45:18.33,ENOUGH TO WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER.
651,00:45:20.57,00:45:20.57,"I HAVE AN OATH FROM LISA AND SKUPIN THAT THEY'RE WITH ME,"
652,00:45:24.53,00:45:24.53,THAT DENISE IS GOING HOME. BUT PEOPLE ARE OUT HERE PLAYING
653,00:45:28.07,00:45:28.07,"A GAME FOR A MILLION DOLLARS, AND IF THEY GET ANY CRAZY IDEAS"
654,00:45:31.27,00:45:31.27,I COULD BE IN FOR A NASTY SURPRISE TONIGHT.
655,00:45:42.73,00:45:42.73,>> IS THIS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. I'M STILL ON BOARD.
656,00:45:47.57,00:45:47.57,ARE WE STILL GOOD? >> IT'S REALLY.
657,00:45:50.03,00:45:50.03,"MEESE LEASA AND I ARE TIGHT, RIGHT."
658,00:45:51.57,00:45:51.57,>> I KNOW. >> AND IT'S OUR DECISION BETWEEN
659,00:45:53.73,00:45:53.73,YOU AND MALCOLM. >> ABSOLUTELY.
660,00:45:54.97,00:45:54.97,">> SO, OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU'RE ON BOARD WITH US, THEN IT'S THREE"
661,00:45:59.37,00:45:59.37,TO ONE. >> THEN IT'S THREE TO ONE.
662,00:46:00.77,00:46:00.77,">> IF WE DECIDE TO GO WITH MALCOLM, THEN, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE"
663,00:46:05.27,00:46:05.27,GONE. >> I'LL BE GONE.
664,00:46:06.27,00:46:06.27,"I KNOW, SO MY PLAN WILL BE MALCOLM WITH THE HOPES THAT YOU"
665,00:46:09.73,00:46:09.73,"TWO STAY ON THAT. I MEAN, I'M 100% ON THAT."
666,00:46:12.50,00:46:12.50,>> YOU WOULD BE SILLY. >> 100%.
667,00:46:16.17,00:46:16.17,>> TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. >> I AM SO MAD.
668,00:46:18.27,00:46:18.27,"MALCOLM AND I COULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER AND SPLIT THE VOTE,"
669,00:46:21.10,00:46:21.10,"HAVE IT BE A TIE, BUT NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN."
670,00:46:24.07,00:46:24.07,SO MY HEAD IS CLEARLY ON THE BLOCK TONIGHT.
671,00:46:26.80,00:46:26.80,>> YOU WILL WRITE MALCOLM'S NAME DOWN.
672,00:46:31.53,00:46:31.53,>> IT'S GUARANTEED. THE PROBLEM IS SKUPIN IS KIND OF
673,00:46:34.23,00:46:34.23,THE DREAMER GUY. HIS MIND IS GOING A THOUSAND
674,00:46:36.80,00:46:36.80,DIFFERENT PLACES AND HE MAY NOT ALWAYS SEE THE REPERCUSSIONS.
675,00:46:40.03,00:46:40.03,WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE THE BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST TO
676,00:46:42.60,00:46:42.60,THE END. SO I HAVE TO FIGURE ON THE A WAY
677,00:46:45.03,00:46:45.03,TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IT'S WORTH IT TO TAKE ME WITH THEM.
678,00:46:48.97,00:46:48.97,"I'M ONE STUBBORN, DETERMINED WOMAN."
679,00:46:51.27,00:46:51.27,"AND IF I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN, I'M GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN."
680,00:46:59.23,00:46:59.23,">> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, DUDE? >> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A WEIRD,"
681,00:47:05.57,00:47:05.57,"INSTINCTIVE, PRIMITIVE SIDE OF ME THAT SAYS GO AGAINST THE"
682,00:47:09.73,00:47:09.73,BEST. GO AGAINST THE BEST.
683,00:47:11.33,00:47:11.33,GO AGAINST THE BEST. >> I KNOW.
684,00:47:12.83,00:47:12.83,>> IS THERE HONOR IN BEATING MALCOLM OVER BEATING YOU OR
685,00:47:17.57,00:47:17.57,LISA? IS THERE ANY HONOR IN THAT?
686,00:47:21.00,00:47:21.00,">> I MEAN, THERE IS TO SOME EXTENT, BUT WILL IT HAPPEN?"
687,00:47:24.63,00:47:24.63,"AND IS THAT A RISK THAT'S WORTH TAKING, KNOWING-- IF THE JURY"
688,00:47:35.07,00:47:35.07,"VOTES WITH MALCOLM, IS THERE HONOR BEATING HIM?"
689,00:47:37.63,00:47:37.63,MY FEAR IS WE WON'T. >> THE OBVIOUS CHOICE IS VOTE
690,00:47:42.20,00:47:42.20,MALCOLM OUT. THAT SEEMS LIKE THE OBVIOUS.
691,00:47:44.20,00:47:44.20,"BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE MALCOLM"
692,00:47:47.77,00:47:47.77,"AND BEAT HIM STRAIGHT UP MAN TO MAN, TWO WARRIORS, FOUGHT TO A"
693,00:47:51.80,00:47:51.80,HEAD. HE WON THREE INDIVIDUAL
694,00:47:53.27,00:47:53.27,CHALLENGES. I WON THREE INDIVIDUAL
695,00:47:55.37,00:47:55.37,CHALLENGES. WHAT A GREAT HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE
696,00:48:02.67,00:48:02.67,THAT WOULD BE. >> I HAVE A RESPECT FOR THE TWO
697,00:48:04.10,00:48:04.10,OF YOU. I JUST FEEL THIS FRIENDSHIP WITH
698,00:48:06.93,00:48:06.93,YOU AND LISA. I'M GETTING ALL CHOCKED UP.
699,00:48:09.83,00:48:09.83,"I SWEAR TO GOD, IT'S NOT A PLOY. THIS IS NO PLOY."
700,00:48:13.97,00:48:13.97,"I REALLY CARE ABOUT BOTH OF YOU, AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE I WILL"
701,00:48:17.67,00:48:17.67,"RESPECT, WHATEVER YOU BOTH DECIDE."
702,00:48:20.17,00:48:20.17,I FEEL THERE ARE FRIENDSHIPS THAT HAVE FORMED OUT HERE THAT
703,00:48:23.07,00:48:23.07,WILL SUPERCEDE THIS GAME. MALCOLM AND I MAY HAVE HAD AN
704,00:48:26.17,00:48:26.17,"ALLIANCE, BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND A"
705,00:48:28.83,00:48:28.83,"TRUE FRIENDSHIP. BUT THIS IS ALSO A GAME, AND YOU"
706,00:48:31.17,00:48:31.17,"HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU GUYS, BUT YOU KNOW WHERE"
707,00:48:33.97,00:48:33.97,"I'M VOTING. >> WOW, IT'S SUCH A BIG"
708,00:48:37.57,00:48:37.57,DECISION. >> IT IS.
709,00:48:44.70,00:48:44.70,">> I JUST HEARD YOUR COMRADE OUT, ALL THE REASONS WHY SHE"
710,00:48:48.87,00:48:48.87,SHOULD COME INSTEAD OF YOU. >> SHE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART.
711,00:48:53.70,00:48:53.70,>> RIGHT NOW I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHO I'M GOING TO KEEP YET.
712,00:48:57.03,00:48:57.03,I AM STRONGLY CONSIDERING KEEPING MALCOLM.
713,00:48:59.50,00:48:59.50,"YOU KNOW, MY WIFE SAID TO ME AS I WAS WALKING OUT THE DOOR, MAKE"
714,00:49:04.10,00:49:04.10,"US PROUD OF YOU."" AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO THE"

723,00:49:34.90,00:49:34.90,ASSUMPTION BECAUSE SKUPIN IS A WILD CARD HERE.
724,00:49:44.27,00:49:44.27,>> HE'S GOOD AT THAT. HANDING THE TITLE OF SOLE
725,00:49:48.93,00:49:48.93,SURVIVOR ON A PLATTER TO MALCOLM WOULD JUST BE STUPID.
726,00:49:53.80,00:49:53.80,EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED UP TO PLAY THIS GAME CAME TO WIN.
727,00:49:56.63,00:49:56.63,"AND I DID, TOO. SO AFTER WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,"
728,00:50:01.50,00:50:01.50,I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE MALCOLM IS NOT IN THE

744,00:51:12.97,00:51:12.97,>> ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE ALLIANCES
745,00:51:15.10,00:51:15.10,"FROM THE START, AND IS THERE A LOYALTY THAT YOU HOPE WILL TAKE"
746,00:51:17.97,00:51:17.97,YOU INTO THAT FINAL THREE? DO YOU LOOK AT NEW ALLIANCES
747,00:51:20.67,00:51:20.67,THAT WERE FORMED WITH THE FOUR THAT GOT US HERE?
748,00:51:23.77,00:51:23.77,AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT EACH LAYER OF THAT.

754,00:51:41.90,00:51:41.90,THERE'S CLEARLY SOME SORT OF LOYALTY TO DENISE BUT IT'S BEEN
755,00:51:44.57,00:51:44.57,"COMPLICATED. >> YEAH, THE STORY LINES GETS"
756,00:51:48.67,00:51:48.67,INTERTWINED. EVERYTHING GETS MIXED UP.

758,00:51:54.50,00:51:54.50,WITH AT THE END. I WAS CLOSE WITH ANGY ON DAY ONE
759,00:51:57.63,00:51:57.63,AND HAD TO CUT HER THROAT EARLIER THAN I HAD TO CONSIDER
760,00:52:00.93,00:52:00.93,"GETTING RID OF DENISE. >> Jeff: DENISE, THAT HAS TO"
761,00:52:04.13,00:52:04.13,"GIVE YOU A BIT OF CONCERN. >> ABSOLUTELY, INCREDIBLY"

764,00:52:13.07,00:52:13.07,DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS AND LUCK OF THE DRAW GOT BACK TOGETHER

767,00:52:21.43,00:52:21.43,">> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU COULD READ DENISES COMMENT TWO WAYS."
768,00:52:25.60,00:52:25.60,>> ANY GUILT I FELT FOR WHAT I JUST SAID IS GONE NOW.
769,00:52:29.90,00:52:29.90,BUT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT. WE BOTH HAD TO FORM NEW
770,00:52:32.87,00:52:32.87,RELATIONSHIPS TO SURVIVE IN THIS GRAHAM.
771,00:52:34.93,00:52:34.93,WHEN WE GOT BACK TOGETHER WE WORKED TOGETHER AND WORKED
772,00:52:38.27,00:52:38.27,TOGETHER VERY WELL. IT WAS ALWAYS TO A FINAL FOUR
773,00:52:41.53,00:52:41.53,END AND WE BOTH NEW EXWOOU THAT. >> YUP.

775,00:52:46.13,00:52:46.13,OVER HERE WITH LISA AND SKUPIN IT'S ALWAYS SEEMED SORT OF
776,00:52:49.63,00:52:49.63,"HARMONIOUS. >> ACTUALLY, OUR RELATIONSHIP"
777,00:52:50.97,00:52:50.97,"HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS AN ""OPEN RELATIONSHIP,"" BECAUSE WE HAVE"
778,00:52:54.33,00:52:54.33,NOT BEEN TOGETHER ALL ALONG THE PATH.
779,00:52:56.93,00:52:56.93,"WE VOTED SEPARATE WAYS. WE WANTED TO BE TOGETHER, BUT I"
780,00:53:00.17,00:53:00.17,"DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE OUT MY ALLIANCE, AND SO HE WENT WITH"
781,00:53:03.27,00:53:03.27,"HIS NEW ONE, AND THEN WE KIND OF RECONNECTED."
782,00:53:06.47,00:53:06.47,SO IT HAS NOT BEEN A TRUE-BLUE ALLIANCE ALL THE WAY ALONG.
783,00:53:09.67,00:53:09.67,">> Jeff: MALCOLM, THAT'S A LITTLE LIKE UNREQUITED LOVE."
784,00:53:13.33,00:53:13.33,"""WE WANTED TO BE TOGETHER BUT THE FORCES KEPT US APART."""
785,00:53:17.10,00:53:17.10,AND SUDDENLY THAT'S TWO VOTES OVER THERE.
786,00:53:19.67,00:53:19.67,">> THAT WAS A SWEET STORY. >> YEAH, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT"
787,00:53:23.90,00:53:23.90,GOES ON WITH THOSE TWO. THAT'S HOW THEY'VE BEEN FOR A
788,00:53:26.80,00:53:26.80,"REALLY LONG TIME OUT HERE. SO THIS LATE IN THE GAME,"
789,00:53:29.17,00:53:29.17,READING INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.
790,00:53:32.47,00:53:32.47,">> Jeff: SKUPIN, LET'S TALK ABOUT FAVORS, LIKE MALCOLM GAVE"
791,00:53:37.63,00:53:37.63,YOU THIS GREAT GIFT. HE LET YOUR SON HAVE THE
792,00:53:40.80,00:53:40.80,"""SURVIVOR"" EXPERIENCE. HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT WILL THAT"

794,00:53:45.60,00:53:45.60,"GOT FAVORS FOR LIFE. >> Jeff: LISA, HOW ABOUT YOU."
795,00:53:50.03,00:53:50.03,DO YOU THINK FAVORS WILL PLAY A PART IN TONIGHT'S VOTE?
796,00:53:52.67,00:53:52.67,>> I DON'T THINK SO. BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A
797,00:53:55.23,00:53:55.23,MILLION-DOLLAR FAVOR. I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY FAVORS
798,00:53:58.43,00:53:58.43,HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED IN THIS GAME THAT WOULD BE WORTH A MILLION
799,00:54:02.00,00:54:02.00,DOLLARS OR GIVING UP THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
800,00:54:05.77,00:54:05.77,">> Jeff: SO TONIGHT, THIS IS SIMPLY STRATEGY FOR YOU, GET OUT"
801,00:54:08.47,00:54:08.47,THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BEAT ME. >> YES.
802,00:54:11.50,00:54:11.50,">> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE"
803,00:54:13.97,00:54:13.97,"YOU'VE GOT A GREAT STORY. ""I WAS ON THE WORST TRIBE."
804,00:54:18.13,00:54:18.13,I WON MY WAY BACK. I'VE WON SOME CHALLENGES.
805,00:54:21.13,00:54:21.13,"I'VE DONE SOME SOLID FAVORS. SEEM TO BE LIKABLE."""
806,00:54:24.63,00:54:24.63,"YOU COULD BE THE BIGGEST THEFT. >> YEAH, I THINK I DO HAVE A"
807,00:54:27.80,00:54:27.80,PRETTY COOL STORY IF I MAKE IT PAST TONIGHT.
808,00:54:30.30,00:54:30.30,BUT DENISE HAS DUN D.N.A. IT ONE TAD BIG BETTER.
809,00:54:33.50,00:54:33.50,SHE WENT TO EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL.
810,00:54:35.17,00:54:35.17,MY HANDS ARE DIRTY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SITTING OVER THERE
811,00:54:38.97,00:54:38.97,BECAUSE I FLIPPED. SHE NEVER HAD TO FLOIP ANYBODY.
812,00:54:43.20,00:54:43.20,SHE FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE AND SHE'S THE ONLY KALABAW HERE SO
813,00:54:47.07,00:54:47.07,DENISE IS FAR AND AWAY MORE DANGEROUS IN THE FINAL THREE.
814,00:54:50.40,00:54:50.40,>> Jeff: SKUPIN MALCOLM'S STORY IS VERY CLEAR.
815,00:54:53.50,00:54:53.50,I REALIZE I'M A THREAT. SHE DWARFS ME.
816,00:54:55.53,00:54:55.53,">> IT'S A STRONG CASE. MALCOLM AND I, DENISE AND I,"
817,00:55:01.23,00:55:01.23,LISA AND I HAVE RUN SCENARIOS WHAT THE OTHER PERSON WOULD SAY
818,00:55:05.13,00:55:05.13,WHEN IT CAME TO THE FINAL THREE. EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT STORY.
819,00:55:09.73,00:55:09.73,">> Jeff: LISA, IS THERE A REASON YOU SHOULD TAKE MALCOLM"
820,00:55:12.07,00:55:12.07,TO THE END? >> DON'T HESITATE THAT LONG.
821,00:55:16.33,00:55:16.33,( LAUGHTER ). >> THERE'S NOT A REASON FOR ME
822,00:55:20.33,00:55:20.33,TO TAKE HIM TO THE END. >> Jeff: WOW.
823,00:55:26.30,00:55:26.30,"MALCOLM, HOW DOES THAT FEEL? >> UH-- IT'S, UH, UPSETTING TO"
824,00:55:31.77,00:55:31.77,HEAR LISA'S ANSWER. I'VE LOOKED PEOPLE IN THE EYES
825,00:55:35.30,00:55:35.30,AND SHOOK HANDS AND WE HAVE DEALS THAT GO BEYOND THIS GAME
826,00:55:38.83,00:55:38.83,AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING TAKES PRECEDENCE TONIGHT.
827,00:55:43.73,00:55:43.73,">> Jeff: WELL, THE ONLY PERSON WHO FEELS SAFE RIGHT NOW IS"

848,00:58:02.07,00:58:02.07,LIST OF PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SWAY TOMORROW NIGHT.
849,00:58:04.47,00:58:04.47,THAT'S THE INVOICE FOR DOING WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO.

910,01:01:59.30,01:01:59.30,COULD PLAY THIS WHOLE GAME STRATEGICALLY ENOUGH TO GET
911,01:02:03.50,01:02:03.50,MYSELF IN THE FINAL THREE. TO AMAZINGNESS.

915,01:02:17.53,01:02:17.53,TELL MYSELF THE SAME THING. BUT THOUGHT OF DOUBT KEPT
916,01:02:22.93,01:02:22.93,CREEPING IN BECAUSE I EVERY TIME I GOT AROUND A CAMPFIRE I
917,01:02:27.20,01:02:27.20,"THOUGHT, DON'T FALL IN THE SUCKER."
918,01:02:28.83,01:02:28.83,"BUT I'M HERE, AND IT FEELS GOOD TO BE HERE."
919,01:02:33.17,01:02:33.17,">> WOW, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT FINAL THREE, THOUGH."
920,01:02:36.17,01:02:36.17,I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS FINAL THREE.
921,01:02:38.87,01:02:38.87,JUST THE-- THE CAMARADERIE BETWEEN THE THREE OF US.
922,01:02:41.50,01:02:41.50,>> I LIKE TO THINK THERE'S NO RUNAWAY.

925,01:02:54.63,01:02:54.63,THAT WAS A THING OF MY PAST. AND NOW I'M BACK IN THE GAME OF

927,01:03:00.50,01:03:00.50,"WOULD FEEL VERY SIMILAR, BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE WHAT I"

935,01:03:28.60,01:03:28.60,AND YET IT'S A HUGE PART OF IT WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING THE
936,01:03:34.77,01:03:34.77,GAME. THE OVERWHELMING FEELING IS ONE
937,01:03:37.13,01:03:37.13,"OF GRATITUDE. I MEAN, OF THE 18 THAT STARTED,"
938,01:03:40.53,01:03:40.53,THERE ARE ONLY THREE THAT GET TO EXPERIENCE DAY 39.

961,01:05:42.87,01:05:42.87,FINAL THREE. I'M NOT ONLY PROUD TO BE HERE
962,01:05:46.53,01:05:46.53,BUT I TRULY FEEL LIKE I DESERVE TO BE HERE.
963,01:05:49.03,01:05:49.03,I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADAPT AND ASSIMILATE NOT JUST IN ONE

965,01:05:56.40,01:05:56.40,MY ABILITY TO DO THAT GAVE ME TIME NOT ONLY TO BUILD INITIAL
966,01:06:01.97,01:06:01.97,ALLIANCES BUT SUB ALLIANCES. IT GAVE ME TIME TO PROVE TO
967,01:06:05.47,01:06:05.47,DIFFERENT TRIBES I HAD VALUE AND A RELATIONSHIP TO KEEP ME AROUND
968,01:06:07.67,01:06:07.67,AS A WORKHORSE AT CAMP AND A VALUE AS STRATEGIST POSITIVE I

974,01:06:29.17,01:06:29.17,"AND ULTIMATELY, I DID OUTLAST ALL OF YOU."
975,01:06:32.63,01:06:32.63,AND I BELIEVE THAT I DESERVE THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.

977,01:06:40.87,01:06:40.87,"OUTPLAYED, AND OUTLAST. WE JUST DID IT IN DIFFERENT"
978,01:06:44.03,01:06:44.03,WAYS. AND IT'S YOURS TO JUDGE WHICH
979,01:06:46.87,01:06:46.87,STRATEGY DESERVES THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION
980,01:06:50.93,01:06:50.93,DOLLARS. MY STRATEGY WAS CERTAINLY NOT
981,01:06:54.13,01:06:54.13,"PRETTY. I MEAN, IT WAS BASICALLY RUN"
982,01:06:56.10,01:06:56.10,WIDE OPEN AND THEN JUST FALL DOWN AND THEN GET UP AND DUST
983,01:06:59.13,01:06:59.13,"MYSELF OFF, ADJUST, LEARN SOMETHING, AND RUN SOME MORE."
984,01:07:03.07,01:07:03.07,"BUT I DID PLAY MY OWN GAME. UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE BIG"
985,01:07:07.70,01:07:07.70,"MISTAKES I FEEL HIKE I MADE WAS NOT FOLLOWING MY HEART, BUT IT"
986,01:07:11.27,01:07:11.27,"WASN'T UNTIL MY BROTHER CAME AND HE SAID, ""YOU NEED TO TRUST YOUR"

988,01:07:18.57,01:07:18.57,AND IT JUST HIT ME. I HADN'T TRUST MY GUT.
989,01:07:22.43,01:07:22.43,AND I HAD FORGOTTEN IT WAS A GIM.
990,01:07:24.33,01:07:24.33,"AND FROM THAT POINT ON, I SWITCHED."
991,01:07:26.30,01:07:26.30,I NEEDED TO PLAY THIS GAME WORTHY OF THE GAME.
992,01:07:28.83,01:07:28.83,IT WOULD BE LIKE BEING IN A BOXING RING AND BEING AFRAID TO
993,01:07:31.70,01:07:31.70,THROW A PUNCH BECAUSE I MIGHT HURT SOMEBODY.
994,01:07:34.27,01:07:34.27,"AND SO, AT THE END, I FINALLY GOT IT."
995,01:07:38.20,01:07:38.20,I LEARNED. I GREW.
996,01:07:40.50,01:07:40.50,AND THREW A PUNCH THAT KNOCKED OUT THE HEAVIED WEIGHT CHAMPION
997,01:07:44.47,01:07:44.47,"OF THIS SEASON, AND SAT ME HERE. SO I KNOW IT WASN'T A PRETTY"
998,01:07:49.17,01:07:49.17,"GAME. BUT I LEARNED, I GREW, AND I'M"
999,01:07:52.20,01:07:52.20,PROUD OF THE FINAL GAME THAT I PLAYED AT THE END.

1004,01:08:14.83,01:08:14.83,RETURNING PLAYERS TO NOT PROGRESS FARTHER THAN THEY DID.
1005,01:08:18.73,01:08:18.73,SO I DID THINGS WITH SUCH #-R FIRE BECAUSE I KNEW THAT MY BACK
1006,01:08:25.70,01:08:25.70,WAS UP AGAINST A WALL MORE SO THAN ANYBODY OUT HERE.
1007,01:08:29.53,01:08:29.53,"I THINK I PLAYED MY GUTS OUT. I MEAN, I GOT PIECES OF MASK"
1008,01:08:35.10,01:08:35.10,STICKING IN MY FACE. I HAD TO RESPECT THE CORE OF

1010,01:08:40.97,01:08:40.97,I CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME ANY OTHER WAY.

1024,01:09:48.73,01:09:48.73,BECAUSE IF YOU STARTED THE GAME WITH THIS HOLY THAN THOU

1092,01:14:02.23,01:14:02.23,AND THAT'S WHAT I KNEW AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE
1093,01:14:05.33,01:14:05.33,MINDSIDE AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY VOTED.
1094,01:14:07.60,01:14:07.60,I WOULD NEVER HAVE WANTED TO GET RID OF YOU.

1099,01:14:25.73,01:14:25.73,CAME OUT AND GAVE HER OPENING SPEECH SHE WAS SWINGING FOR THE
1100,01:14:29.03,01:14:29.03,FENCES. I DIDN'T THINK SHE HAD IT IN HER
1101,01:14:31.20,01:14:31.20,"BUT IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR FROM HER, AND FOR THE"
1102,01:14:33.50,01:14:33.50,FIRST TIME I REALLY CONSIDERED WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN TONIGHT.

1113,01:15:05.47,01:15:05.47,"YOU'RE RIGHT, BEING A THERAPIST IS WHAT I DO, AND SOME OF THAT"
1114,01:15:09.13,01:15:09.13,IS APPEASING BECAUSE THERE IS VALUE IN THIS GAME TO PLAYING
1115,01:15:11.53,01:15:11.53,THAT SOCIAL PIECE. BUT THERE'S ALSO VALUE IN JUST
1116,01:15:15.17,01:15:15.17,LISTENING AND OBSERVES TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
1117,01:15:17.23,01:15:17.23,THAT'S A PART OF WHO I AM THAT I COULDN'T NOT BRING INTO THE
1118,01:15:21.17,01:15:21.17,GAME. SO IT MAY SEEM APPEASING BUT I
1119,01:15:23.30,01:15:23.30,WAS PLAYING THE GAME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

1123,01:15:34.80,01:15:34.80,>> BY THE STRATEGY THEY PLAYED. BY THE STRATEGY OF BEING HERE.
1124,01:15:38.23,01:15:38.23,I I DON'T THINK THEY PLAYED THAT KIND OF A STRATEGIC GAME.
1125,01:15:41.90,01:15:41.90,">> THANKS. >> Jeff: THANKS, MALCOLM."
1126,01:15:47.37,01:15:47.37,JEFF. >> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE ALL

1132,01:16:11.57,01:16:11.57,PEOPLE THAT MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. PEOPLE THAT WATCH THINGS HAPPEN.
1133,01:16:15.67,01:16:15.67,AND PEOPLE THAT WONDER WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED.
1134,01:16:19.13,01:16:19.13,( LAUGHTER ). WHICH ONE ARE YOU?
1135,01:16:22.23,01:16:22.23,GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES IN THE GAME OF WHICH ONE YOU ARE.
1136,01:16:25.67,01:16:25.67,>> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

1138,01:16:31.23,01:16:31.23,NEWS TODAY OR MAKE THE NEWS? AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY THINK
1139,01:16:35.00,01:16:35.00,WAS HUGE HERE IS MY NECK WAS CHOPPING BLOCK EVERY SINGLE DAY.
1140,01:16:43.47,01:16:43.47,"WHEN I LOOK AT LISA AND DENISE'S GAME, I NEVER HEARD DENISE'S"

1144,01:17:03.87,01:17:03.87,"MAYBE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU DIDN'T PLAY IN THE MIDDLE, HOW"
1145,01:17:07.23,01:17:07.23,YOU DID FLOAT ALONG LIKE DENISE THAT SEPARATES THE TWO OF YOU?
1146,01:17:11.50,01:17:11.50,>> I CAN'T EVEN RECALL A TIME I FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE.
1147,01:17:14.23,01:17:14.23,I MAYBE SHOULD HAVE FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY
1148,01:17:20.27,01:17:20.27,WIDE OPEN THE WHOLE TIME. I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MAKE A
1149,01:17:24.57,01:17:24.57,MAJOR MOVE WHEN I FOUND OUT MALCOLM HAD THE IDOL AND I WENT
1150,01:17:28.47,01:17:28.47,TO PETE AND SAID THIS IS TIME TO BLINDSIDE HIM.
1151,01:17:31.00,01:17:31.00,WE HAD IT ALL PLANNED AND IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES IT BLEW UP.
1152,01:17:33.87,01:17:33.87,"PETE HAD A PLAN B. AND THAT WAS TO SEND YOU HOME,"
1153,01:17:36.50,01:17:36.50,"WHICH STILL WAS GOOD, BECAUSE IT WOULD KEEP OUR TANDANG NUMBERS--"

1161,01:18:00.87,01:18:00.87,"WAS A GREAT PLAN, AND I PLAYED IT HARD FROM HERE."
1162,01:18:04.77,01:18:04.77,"I SAID WE'VE GOT PLAN B, GIETZ. GO WITH PLAN B."
1163,01:18:08.97,01:18:08.97,THAT'S NOT FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE STANDING UP HERE AND

1165,01:18:14.87,01:18:14.87,THAT'S PRETTY VOCAL. >> ALL RIGHT.

1178,01:19:01.30,01:19:01.30,SITTING IN THE FINAL FOUR. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE I DESERVE

1191,01:19:47.23,01:19:47.23,BEING THE MOST UNLIKABLE PERSON IS NOT THE LABEL THAT I WANTED
1192,01:19:51.40,01:19:51.40,TO LEAVE HERE WITH. I WAS DEMORALIZED.
1193,01:19:54.57,01:19:54.57,I WAS MADE TO LOOK THIS LITTLE. >> HINDSIGHT IS 20-20.
