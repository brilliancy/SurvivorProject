2,00:00:06.20,00:00:06.20,>> KEITH: She's kind of a lonelamb.
3,00:00:08.03,00:00:08.03,I think Amber made a tacticalmistake by staying tight with
4,00:00:09.90,00:00:09.90,Jerri.>> JEFF: The food situation was
5,00:00:12.23,00:00:12.23,desperate.>> AMBER: This is how much rice
6,00:00:15.47,00:00:15.47,we have left to last us 14 days.>> JEFF: And the tribe was
7,00:00:19.67,00:00:19.67,running on empty.>> ELISABETH: I feel so weak.
8,00:00:22.57,00:00:22.57,I'm feeling terrible.>> JEFF: The rising waters were
9,00:00:25.43,00:00:25.43,a growing threat to theBarramundi camp.
10,00:00:28.50,00:00:28.50,>> ELISABETH: A storm could comeand just wash our tent right
11,00:00:29.80,00:00:29.80,out.It's right in line with the
12,00:00:31.70,00:00:31.70,riverbed.>> JEFF: At the immunity
13,00:00:34.50,00:00:34.50,"challenge, Colby's dwindlingstrength didn't stop him from"
14,00:00:36.87,00:00:36.87,winning the talisman.( Colby yelling )
15,00:00:41.80,00:00:41.80,">> JEFF: Back at camp, the tribewas offered more food."
16,00:00:44.43,00:00:44.43,"You've got 13 days left, and Idon't think you're going to make"
17,00:00:47.00,00:00:47.00,it.But it came with a hefty price.
18,00:00:51.40,00:00:51.40,I need something of value.I'm talking camp: your tarps and
19,00:00:54.10,00:00:54.10,that Texas flag.>> TINA: I think it was a fair
20,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,trade.There's worse things in life
21,00:00:59.43,00:00:59.43,"than being wet, such as starvingto death."

25,00:02:40.67,00:02:40.67,">> ELISABETH: This game, in thepast three days, has become"
26,00:02:44.00,00:02:44.00,drastically primal.We are just beings out here that
27,00:02:51.03,00:02:51.03,need food.>> AMBER: The servings are so
28,00:02:59.47,00:02:59.47,"small.It's, like, maybe four"
29,00:03:01.93,00:03:01.93,spoonfuls.>> ELISABETH: It's turned into a
30,00:03:04.93,00:03:04.93,"nightmare, all of a sudden.You just can't think about it."
31,00:03:09.87,00:03:09.87,The things that are importanthave become really clear here.
32,00:03:14.63,00:03:14.63,"You know, you shed yourself ofall excess, and we just gave up"
33,00:03:18.20,00:03:18.20,"our shelter for food.And that is a pretty, pretty"

35,00:03:26.73,00:03:26.73,"rice, we decided we needed to bevery, very careful with it this"
36,00:03:28.90,00:03:28.90,time.The risk of losing it again just
37,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,wasn't going to be an option.So we measured out the rice cup
38,00:03:35.67,00:03:35.67,by cup by cup by cup.This is the least amount of rice
39,00:03:38.70,00:03:38.70,we've ever had.>> TINA: No wonder we're all so
40,00:03:41.17,00:03:41.17,weak and tired.This is all we're living on.
41,00:03:44.60,00:03:44.60,>> ELISABETH: Anyone want somescrapings from the pot?
42,00:03:47.80,00:03:47.80,">> COLBY: Oh, sure.>> TINA: That rice gave me hope"
43,00:03:51.07,00:03:51.07,that I was not going to have tobe out here starving to death
44,00:03:54.20,00:03:54.20,"for the next 11 days, which, tobe honest, that's what I thought"
45,00:03:57.57,00:03:57.57,was going to occur.>> AMBER: Hope factors in a huge
46,00:04:02.57,00:04:02.57,"amount for your existence here.I mean, you always have to hope"
47,00:04:05.67,00:04:05.67,"for the next day to come, hopefor a fish, a nice night with no"
48,00:04:09.37,00:04:09.37,rain.And I just keep hoping that the
49,00:04:14.47,00:04:14.47,"next three days to come, I'mstill here and the next three"
50,00:04:18.93,00:04:18.93,days to come that I'm stillhere.
51,00:04:20.87,00:04:20.87,">> ELISABETH: Keith, Colby andTina are three together."
52,00:04:25.63,00:04:25.63,"And they see Amber, althoughshe's grown a lot, they don't"
53,00:04:29.67,00:04:29.67,"see that she is a strong person.>> TINA: Amber's a sweet girl,"
54,00:04:35.93,00:04:35.93,but you can't get by just onflying below the radar.
55,00:04:41.07,00:04:41.07,She never really proved to methat she could stand on her own
56,00:04:46.37,00:04:46.37,"two feet.Now, she has proved to me that"
57,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,she's a tougher little girl thanI made her out to be.
58,00:04:53.20,00:04:53.20,>> ELISABETH: The people who arein control are basically going
59,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,to push your eject button onetime or another.
60,00:05:01.07,00:05:01.07,And you just hope it's not thenext time.
61,00:05:05.73,00:05:05.73,>> COLBY: Rodger and Elisabethboth know that we brought them
62,00:05:09.50,00:05:09.50,along this entire time with theintent to eliminate them before
63,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,we eliminate ourselves.And they are well aware of the
64,00:05:17.77,00:05:17.77,fact that they've got to winimmunity in order to stick
65,00:05:19.57,00:05:19.57,around.>> ELISABETH: The next
66,00:05:22.77,00:05:22.77,challenges are very important tome.
67,00:05:24.80,00:05:24.80,Reward and immunity.I don't care how hungry and weak
68,00:05:27.33,00:05:27.33,"I am, there's no holding meback."
69,00:05:29.27,00:05:29.27,I need them.>> JEFF: How are you feeling?

75,00:05:59.13,00:05:59.13,several ropes that lead eitherdirectly or indirectly to the
76,00:06:01.63,00:06:01.63,next one.We'll have two carabiners.
77,00:06:04.07,00:06:04.07,One carabiner needs to beattached to your rope at all
78,00:06:06.70,00:06:06.70,"times.So, whenever you change ropes,"
79,00:06:09.27,00:06:09.27,"you take the other carabinerthat's free, clip to the new"
80,00:06:12.07,00:06:12.07,"rope, then unclip from theexisting rope."
81,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,"First person to reach all fourcheckpoints, get to the finish,"
82,00:06:17.57,00:06:17.57,wins the reward.The reward is a food reward with
83,00:06:20.53,00:06:20.53,"a twist.Yo, come on in!"
84,00:06:26.27,00:06:26.27,"As you know, in the Outback...Yeah, lots of cattle, lots of"
