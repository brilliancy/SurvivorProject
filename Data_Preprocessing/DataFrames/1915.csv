195,00:12:27.25,00:12:31.00,Jaison right behind.Brett's still in it.
196,00:12:34.25,00:12:41.21,Everybody climbing up the wall.Everybody is in this challenge.
197,00:12:41.21,00:12:43.38,Russell has his pieces openfirst.

199,00:12:48.12,00:12:54.00,Five people vying for a shot atthe final four.
200,00:12:54.00,00:12:57.12,That much closer to a millionbucks.
201,00:12:57.12,00:13:00.08,The stakes are very clear forBrett.
202,00:13:00.08,00:13:03.79,He has four people working tobeat him.
203,00:13:07.12,00:13:11.17,Brett making quick work of hispuzzle.
204,00:13:11.17,00:13:14.12,Mick now getting in on it.His puzzle starting to come
205,00:13:14.12,00:13:16.71,together.Russell starting to come

207,00:13:19.29,00:13:22.79,together.Everybody needs to keep moving.
208,00:13:22.79,00:13:28.04,"Somebody going home tonight.Jaison, nowhere close at this"
209,00:13:28.04,00:13:32.12,point.37 days is a long time to lose
210,00:13:32.12,00:13:37.46,now.Russell getting a little closer.
211,00:13:37.46,00:13:41.58,"Mick getting closer.Right now it is Brett, Russell,"
212,00:13:41.58,00:13:44.88,and Mick.You need to keep moving.
213,00:13:44.88,00:13:47.04,This challenge is going to endsoon.
214,00:13:47.04,00:13:50.54,Russell trying to pick up thepace.
215,00:13:51.50,00:13:54.17,Brett very close.Brett with only a couple of
216,00:13:54.17,00:13:57.17,pieces left.Russell trying to scramble.
217,00:13:57.17,00:14:05.17,Mick hustling to finish.Brett has it!
218,00:14:05.17,00:14:08.67,Brett wins immunity!>> Yeah.
219,00:14:10.12,00:14:21.38,">> Oh, man.>> PROBST: Brett, come on over."
220,00:14:25.96,00:14:30.88,"For the third time in a row,Brett wins individual immunity."
221,00:14:30.88,00:14:34.92,"Odds clearly stacked againstyou, you continue to defy them."
222,00:14:34.92,00:14:37.54,Brett is safe at tonight'sTribal Council.
223,00:14:37.54,00:14:42.79,One of the original Foa Foafour going home after 37 days.
224,00:14:42.79,00:14:45.04,I don't envy this afternoon.It's going to be an interesting
225,00:14:45.04,00:14:46.17,one.Grab your stuff.
226,00:14:46.17,00:14:48.08,Head back to camp.I will see you at Tribal.
227,00:14:48.08,00:14:49.79,Congrats.>> Thanks.
228,00:14:49.79,00:14:52.58,If I didn't win immunity Iknow I was going home.
229,00:14:52.58,00:14:56.08,I've been trying for some timeto get the Foa Foa tribe on the
230,00:14:56.08,00:14:58.54,"jury, and tonight, at Tribalwill be the first time that"
231,00:14:58.54,00:15:02.83,that's happened.To finally see a Foa Foa member
232,00:15:02.83,00:15:23.08,go home will be relieving.>> It is absolutely the worst
233,00:15:23.08,00:15:26.08,feeling to have to go to TribalCouncil tonight.
234,00:15:26.08,00:15:29.83,"All four of us Foa Foa havebeen so tight, loyal, and"
235,00:15:29.83,00:15:34.54,trustworthy to this point.We have no other Galu to
236,00:15:34.54,00:15:37.25,"pick off.I mean, Brett won immunity."
237,00:15:37.25,00:15:40.67,There is no other option.A Foa Foa has to go home and I
238,00:15:40.67,00:15:43.54,"definitely feel like my head'son the chopping block, clearly,"
239,00:15:43.54,00:15:46.29,because I'm the weakest one.I'm just... I'm hanging by
240,00:15:46.29,00:15:50.42,a thread.So what's the plan?
241,00:15:50.42,00:15:54.25,I'm sure they want me.>> Yeah...
242,00:15:54.25,00:15:56.92,I'm gonna change it.>> Promise me?
243,00:15:56.92,00:16:00.17,">> Yeah, I promise you.>> I've trusted you only from"
244,00:16:00.17,00:16:02.67,"the first day, so...>> If it was you, I'd tell you"
245,00:16:02.67,00:16:04.00,right now.>> I know.
246,00:16:04.00,00:16:05.67,"Just like I told you earlier,it might be."
247,00:16:05.67,00:16:07.50,>> I'm trying to keep Nataliebecause she's holding on my
248,00:16:07.50,00:16:11.04,coattails.Who better to take to the final
249,00:16:11.04,00:16:13.04,two than her?There's no way she can beat me
250,00:16:13.04,00:16:16.04,"in votes?'Cause the next challenge, I"
251,00:16:16.04,00:16:19.21,"think I'll take the next one.He's a kid, so he's going to"
252,00:16:19.21,00:16:22.54,"give it all he's got, but youknow what?"
253,00:16:22.54,00:16:25.08,All backs are up against thewall now.
254,00:16:25.08,00:16:27.12,">> This is the hard part,sitting here waiting for Tribal"
255,00:16:27.12,00:16:30.38,Council.Just going to go through the
256,00:16:30.38,00:16:33.88,motions and do what we can dotonight.
257,00:16:33.88,00:16:38.92,And move on to tomorrow.>> Yup.
258,00:16:38.92,00:16:42.71,You guys know what you're doingor up in the air?
259,00:16:42.71,00:16:45.25,">> You know, you always thinkyou know what you're doing but"
260,00:16:45.25,00:16:48.29,"you never actually know what'sgoing to happen, you know."
261,00:16:48.29,00:16:50.29,>> Yup.>> So...
262,00:16:50.29,00:16:53.83,">> Oh!>> What's going on, man?"
263,00:16:53.83,00:16:57.04,>> I'm tired.>> A couple of days left.
264,00:16:57.04,00:17:00.08,">> Jaison checked out of thisgame a long time ago, and the"
265,00:17:00.08,00:17:03.71,"weakest link right now isJaison, even over Natalie."
266,00:17:03.71,00:17:07.96,She's stronger than him.So the question is now Mick or
267,00:17:07.96,00:17:10.25,Jaison?It's a good thing about keeping
268,00:17:10.25,00:17:13.12,Jaison is he can't beat me inthe votes.
269,00:17:13.12,00:17:16.33,The bad thing about keepingJaison is he can't beat Brett
270,00:17:16.33,00:17:20.08,in the challenge.The good thing about keeping
271,00:17:20.08,00:17:24.29,Mick is he can possibly beatBrett in the challenge.
272,00:17:24.29,00:17:28.08,The bad thing about keepingMick is Mick might beat me in
273,00:17:28.08,00:17:33.00,jury votes.One of us is going home.
274,00:17:33.00,00:17:35.67,">> Yeah, well, I mean, yeah-->> The only way me and you can"
275,00:17:35.67,00:17:38.79,stay in the final three isto keep Natalie.
276,00:17:38.79,00:17:40.46,We're gonna have to get rid ofof Mick.
277,00:17:40.46,00:17:42.21,>> I agree.We'll get rid of Mick and then
278,00:17:42.21,00:17:44.46,take another shot at Brett.>> Right.
279,00:17:44.46,00:17:46.79,>> Yeah.Russell and I have a very long
280,00:17:46.79,00:17:49.17,"history of working together.From, I think, day two we"
281,00:17:49.17,00:17:51.71,decided we were going to have analliance and go to the finals
282,00:17:51.71,00:17:55.21,together and I think it'sjust grown exponentially over
283,00:17:55.21,00:17:58.08,the last 37 days and I thinkRussell and I trust each other
284,00:17:58.08,00:18:01.71,"enough that we are comfortable.When I say this, I mean it."
285,00:18:01.71,00:18:05.25,"When he says that, he means it.And so I really do think it will"
286,00:18:05.25,00:18:07.79,be myself and Russell andsomebody else in the finals on
287,00:18:07.79,00:18:12.04,day 39.>> This is how it's going to go.
288,00:18:12.04,00:18:14.96,"I mean, it's going to be Jaisonleaves tonight."
289,00:18:14.96,00:18:17.12,That gives us a shot to beatBrett.
290,00:18:17.12,00:18:19.12,We cannot beat him for themillion dollars.
291,00:18:19.12,00:18:22.08,Jaison can't beat him inanything.
292,00:18:22.08,00:18:24.96,>> The plan is that it beJaison tonight.
293,00:18:24.96,00:18:28.50,"I wish he could stay around,but Natalie's head's much more"
294,00:18:28.50,00:18:32.38,"in the game than Jaison's.He shows up, but he's not"
295,00:18:32.38,00:18:36.12,really into it at all.>> If you agree with me on
296,00:18:36.12,00:18:38.54,"that, we're cool.>> I agree with you on that."
297,00:18:38.54,00:18:41.12,">> We'll go to the final three.I promise you, we're going to"
298,00:18:41.12,00:18:43.50,the final three.>> All right.
299,00:18:43.50,00:18:45.79,I like it.Russell and I had a pact from
300,00:18:45.79,00:18:49.25,the very beginning that itwould be us in the final three.
301,00:18:49.25,00:18:52.83,And the fact that that'sactually on the horizon is a
302,00:18:52.83,00:18:55.12,little shocking.>> All right.
303,00:18:55.12,00:18:57.67,">> Okay, done.>> I'm going to go look"
304,00:18:57.67,00:19:00.04,"this way.You know, I told Mick to vote"
305,00:19:00.04,00:19:05.17,"Jaison, Jaison to vote Mick.So you know, It's up to me and"
306,00:19:05.17,00:19:08.29,Natalie if Mick goes home orif Jaison goes home.
307,00:19:08.29,00:19:11.33,We're the ones making thedecision.
308,00:19:12.50,00:19:15.21,"Well, let's discuss Mick orJaison."
309,00:19:15.21,00:19:17.12,>> There are pros and cons toboth.
310,00:19:17.12,00:19:19.46,>> So why do you think Jaisonshould go tonight?
311,00:19:19.46,00:19:22.21,>> He hasn't been feeling wellthe last couple of days.
312,00:19:22.21,00:19:25.54,He's had nothing to drink.>> Why should we vote off Mick?
313,00:19:25.54,00:19:29.12,">> Voting off Mick would ensurethat he'd be gone tonight, then"
314,00:19:29.12,00:19:32.42,"tomorrow if we win immunity,then it's just me, you, and"
315,00:19:32.42,00:19:35.17,Jaison in the top three and wehave a better chance.
316,00:19:35.17,00:19:40.00,>> I could keep Mick.I could keep Jaison.
317,00:19:40.00,00:19:45.25,They both have goods and bads.So now I'm weighing it.
318,00:19:45.25,00:19:48.83,What in the world am I supposedto do?
319,00:20:07.04,00:20:11.25,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
320,00:20:11.25,00:20:14.12,Erik.Kelly.
321,00:20:14.12,00:20:16.50,Laura.John.

324,00:20:25.79,00:20:29.96,"All right, well, after sevenstraight Tribal Councils in"
325,00:20:29.96,00:20:33.83,"which former Galu members werevoted out, finally, it comes"
326,00:20:33.83,00:20:36.96,down to this-- one of theformer Foa Foa members is going
327,00:20:36.96,00:20:40.62,"home tonight.Jaison, when did the reality"
328,00:20:40.62,00:20:44.54,really hit you that there wasnowhere to hide?
329,00:20:44.54,00:20:48.25,">> Probably when I heard ""Brettwins immunity."""
330,00:20:48.25,00:20:50.71,"I mean, who thought he wasgoing to win three in a row?"
331,00:20:50.71,00:20:53.08,"You know, I came into thischallenge figuring it had to be"
332,00:20:53.08,00:20:55.29,one of our times to take thatnecklace back to move forward
333,00:20:55.29,00:20:58.42,"with the four of us.But clearly, that didn't happen."
334,00:20:58.42,00:21:01.08,">> PROBST: So, Natalie, it seemslike there would be two very"
335,00:21:01.08,00:21:03.50,different approaches totonight's vote.
336,00:21:03.50,00:21:06.67,">> Absolutely.I mean, if we don't beat Brett,"
337,00:21:06.67,00:21:09.33,"clearly, he's going to getevery single vote on the jury."
338,00:21:09.33,00:21:13.08,So do we keep the strongestpeople that could possibly beat
339,00:21:13.08,00:21:15.08,"Brett?The other thought is, do I keep"
340,00:21:15.08,00:21:18.79,someone that I think I can beatin front of the jury?
341,00:21:18.79,00:21:22.08,">> PROBST: Jaison, I'm guessingthe real dilemma is if I keep"
342,00:21:22.08,00:21:25.08,"the right people and we beatBrett, but I keep the wrong"
343,00:21:25.08,00:21:27.21,people because I can't beat theguys I kept.
344,00:21:27.21,00:21:29.33,>> Yeah.And I think it's especially
345,00:21:29.33,00:21:32.79,difficult because there are twoor three people up here who
346,00:21:32.79,00:21:35.25,"could command a lot of the juryvotes, so maybe it is better"
347,00:21:35.25,00:21:38.75,just to try and take out thenext strongest competitor for
348,00:21:38.75,00:21:41.33,"the jury, and see if we can getlucky and get Brett next time."
349,00:21:41.33,00:21:44.12,">> PROBST: Mick, who would haveguessed with only five people"

352,00:21:52.21,00:21:55.17,front of the jury equals amillion bucks.
353,00:21:55.17,00:21:59.79,So it makes sense to keeppeople that can beat him at
354,00:21:59.79,00:22:02.25,this last immunity.>> PROBST: Your argument is all
355,00:22:02.25,00:22:05.17,"hands on deck, got to take outBrett."
356,00:22:05.17,00:22:07.46,>> Right.>> PROBST: Jaison says all
357,00:22:07.46,00:22:10.04,hands on deck could ultimatelybackfire because I still want
358,00:22:10.04,00:22:12.75,to win.Why would that make sense?
359,00:22:12.75,00:22:15.62,>> You're putting a lot morepressure on yourself in saying I

378,00:23:06.25,00:23:10.67,">> Yeah, because how hard is itto beat Foa Foa, really, you"
379,00:23:10.67,00:23:13.50,know?We won one immunity challenge.
380,00:23:13.50,00:23:15.75,He wins three in a row...(laughter)
381,00:23:15.75,00:23:19.12,"You know, we're still gettingbeat by Galu, but only one of"
382,00:23:19.12,00:23:22.88,"them is here.>> PROBST: Jaison, would you"
383,00:23:22.88,00:23:25.04,gladly switch with Brett andtake the necklace tonight?
384,00:23:25.04,00:23:28.04,>> Yeah. Who wouldn't want theodds that he has right now.
385,00:23:28.04,00:23:31.17,"He just has to win one morechallenge, and there might be"
386,00:23:31.17,00:23:34.29,"two of us in the finals, but ifhe got there, he'd definitely"
387,00:23:34.29,00:23:36.92,have the upper hand.>> PROBST: The reason I'm
388,00:23:36.92,00:23:39.17,bringing it up is we're at thepoint in the game where how you
389,00:23:39.17,00:23:42.04,play the game is going to impactthe jury.
390,00:23:42.04,00:23:44.42,"Brett, it's one thing to get tothe end."
391,00:23:44.42,00:23:46.83,It's another to have earned thespot in the end.
392,00:23:46.83,00:23:49.54,">> Yeah, I've won threechallenges in a row which is"
393,00:23:49.54,00:23:52.50,"great, but it don't meananything unless I can win the"
394,00:23:52.50,00:23:54.50,next one.So you got to stay humble in
395,00:23:54.50,00:23:58.08,this game and not feel toostrong in my own abilities to
396,00:23:58.08,00:24:02.50,"potentially screw that up.>> PROBST: All right, let's get"
397,00:24:02.50,00:24:04.71,"to the vote.Brett, I got to tell you, when"
398,00:24:04.71,00:24:07.00,"Tribal Council started, Iwasn't even going to bother"
399,00:24:07.00,00:24:09.92,"asking, but in light of yourcomments, is there somebody"
400,00:24:09.92,00:24:12.62,you want to give that necklaceto so you can switch spots?
401,00:24:12.62,00:24:15.25,">> No, I'm going to keep it.>> PROBST: All right, you"
402,00:24:15.25,00:24:17.62,cannot vote for Brett.Everybody else is fair game.
403,00:24:17.62,00:24:20.75,"It's time to vote.Mick, you're up."
404,00:24:29.21,00:24:32.04,">> This sucks.I hate doing this, but I kind"
405,00:24:32.04,00:24:34.38,of feel like you checked out along time ago.
406,00:24:34.38,00:24:45.92,"So...>> Sorry, buddy, this was a"
407,00:24:45.92,00:24:59.62,tough one.>> I hate that I have to do
408,00:24:59.62,00:25:03.75,"this, but I got to keep to mystrategic play, and this is"
409,00:25:03.75,00:25:07.62,the best move for me to win thegame.
410,00:25:13.79,00:25:16.75,>> PROBST: I'll go tallythe votes.
411,00:25:27.58,00:25:30.17,Once the votes are read thedecision is final.
412,00:25:30.17,00:25:32.46,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
413,00:25:32.46,00:25:35.58,Council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
414,00:25:37.88,00:25:48.25,"First vote, Mick.Jaison."
415,00:25:48.25,00:25:54.71,"One vote Mick, one vote Jaison.Jaison."
416,00:25:54.71,00:26:04.21,"Two votes Jaison, one vote Mick.14th person voted out and the"
417,00:26:04.21,00:26:07.21,"eighth member of our jury,Jaison."
418,00:26:07.21,00:26:08.83,There's three.That's enough.
419,00:26:08.83,00:26:20.100,"You need to bring me your torch.Jaison, the tribe has spoken."
420,00:26:35.17,00:26:38.42,Congratulations on making itto the final four.
421,00:26:38.42,00:26:42.12,Tomorrow you will compete inyour final immunity challenge.
422,00:26:42.12,00:26:45.04,Try to get a good night's sleep.Grab your torches.
423,00:26:45.04,00:26:47.112,Head back to camp.Good night.
424,00:26:54.33,00:26:58.83,>> I'm kind of pissed off atRussell for blindsiding me.
425,00:26:58.83,00:27:01.79,For a relationship that you hadsince day two you at least let
426,00:27:01.79,00:27:04.21,the guy know he's going home.So I don't think I'd be
427,00:27:04.21,00:27:06.17,cheering for Russell in thisone.
428,00:27:06.17,00:27:08.21,I would root for Brett.Brett is the underdog.
429,00:27:08.21,00:27:10.46,He is who we were.We came from nothing to be
430,00:27:10.46,00:27:13.25,something and he did prettymuch the same thing on his own
431,00:27:13.25,00:27:16.38,"to win three straight, maybefour straight."
432,00:27:29.17,00:27:34.42,">> Final four.>> Thank you, Lord."
433,00:27:34.42,00:27:36.75,>> So few torches.It's weird.
434,00:27:36.75,00:27:40.12,>> Yes.>> It's definitely a miracle
435,00:27:40.12,00:27:46.17,"for me to still be here as day37 ends, and there are three"
436,00:27:46.17,00:27:49.62,Foa Foas in the final four.>> Yes. Congratulations.
437,00:27:49.62,00:27:51.83,">> Good work, bro.>> Final four."
438,00:27:51.83,00:27:53.38,>> Final four.>> Final Foa.
439,00:27:53.38,00:27:56.04,>> This is something I didn'treally imagine.
440,00:27:56.04,00:27:59.79,"As I look towards the nextTribal Council, you know, I"
441,00:27:59.79,00:28:02.83,really feel like my fate is inmy own hands.
442,00:28:02.83,00:28:06.04,"As of right now, the only thingI'm banking on is really"
443,00:28:06.04,00:28:09.67,winning another immunitychallenge because if I don't
444,00:28:09.67,00:28:13.17,win I'm probably going to bethe next person to go home.
445,00:28:21.12,00:28:24.17,>> Me and you is in thetop three.
446,00:28:24.17,00:28:26.71,Do you think you can beat me?>> What?
447,00:28:26.71,00:28:29.33,">> If you win the last immunityidol, me and you is in the top"
448,00:28:29.33,00:28:31.58,"three, do you think you canbeat me?"
449,00:28:31.58,00:28:33.75,>> I don't know.>> Do you think it would be a
450,00:28:33.75,00:28:35.17,shot?>> It would be a...
451,00:28:35.17,00:28:38.08,I think it would be prettyclose.
452,00:28:38.08,00:28:41.25,>> Brett won immunity.That means he could possibly
453,00:28:41.25,00:28:44.12,win four immunity challenges ina row.
454,00:28:44.12,00:28:48.33,"That's a humungous threat.Of the people that's here, if I"
455,00:28:48.33,00:28:53.29,"went to the final three, and Igot to choose, dude, I'm here"
456,00:28:53.29,00:28:55.17,who deserves it more.Trust me.
457,00:28:55.17,00:28:57.08,>> Yeah.>> I'm here to win the game.
458,00:28:57.08,00:29:00.25,They should have three at thetop that deserve it the most.
459,00:29:00.25,00:29:02.75,>> I'd rather go up againstsomeone that's harder to beat
460,00:29:02.75,00:29:06.12,"and lose than to, like, putmyself in a position where I go"
461,00:29:06.12,00:29:08.88,up against people that areeasier to beat and win.
462,00:29:08.88,00:29:13.25,>> What I can promise you is meand you will be in the top
463,00:29:13.25,00:29:15.50,"three.Have a seat, man."
464,00:29:15.50,00:29:19.75,">> Yeah.>> So if you win it, then"
465,00:29:19.75,00:29:22.46,"you're safe, of course.If I win it I'll take you to"
466,00:29:22.46,00:29:24.54,"top three.If we win top three, we have no"
467,00:29:24.54,00:29:26.92,doubts.I'm going to do it straight up
468,00:29:26.92,00:29:30.71,with you.Deal.
469,00:29:30.71,00:29:32.21,>> Deal.>> Top three.
470,00:29:32.21,00:29:34.25,>> Legitimate.>> I'm real on this.
471,00:29:34.25,00:29:35.54,">> I'm real, too.>> Okay."
472,00:29:35.54,00:29:38.25,>> This is a big one.>> You got to have some kind of
473,00:29:38.25,00:29:41.21,"insurance policy in this game.If he keeps winning, I got to"
474,00:29:41.21,00:29:44.21,"save myself.Number one, uno, here."
475,00:29:44.21,00:29:46.79,I take care of me.I don't take care of nobody
476,00:29:46.79,00:29:50.17,else this game.So I'm sitting pretty right now.
477,00:29:50.17,00:29:53.25,I have a one-two spot withevery single person out here
478,00:29:53.25,00:29:56.21,"right now, Natalie, Brett, andMick."
479,00:29:56.21,00:29:59.67,It looks like I'm going to bein the top three no matter what.
480,00:29:59.67,00:30:03.71,">> Ooh, it's a big one.>> If I win this challenge"
481,00:30:03.71,00:30:07.29,"today, I'm 100% positive thatthe game is mine."
482,00:30:07.29,00:30:09.92,"I won the million dollars.You know, it's a very"
483,00:30:09.92,00:30:12.54,"interesting situation to be in,but I love it."
484,00:30:12.54,00:30:15.83,This is how I want it to be.>> Tree mail!
485,00:30:15.83,00:30:20.38,Got a little note for you all.All right.
486,00:30:20.38,00:30:26.17,"""Congratulations, final four.You are almost at the end of"
487,00:30:26.17,00:30:28.92,the line.Follow the map to the cliffs on
488,00:30:28.92,00:30:31.75,the coast.There you will find the torches
489,00:30:31.75,00:30:35.96,"of your fallen comrades.At each torch, you will collect"
490,00:30:35.96,00:30:39.96,a representative mask of thosewho were voted out before you.
491,00:30:39.96,00:30:42.88,"At the end of your journey, youwill burn them, paying your"
492,00:30:42.88,00:30:47.00,respects as they each had apart in getting you to this
493,00:30:47.00,00:30:49.58,point.You will then proceed to your
494,00:30:49.58,00:30:56.00,"final immunity challenge.""Each person that has been voted"
495,00:30:56.00,00:30:59.92,out has played some role in howI got where I am right now.
496,00:30:59.92,00:31:02.29,"I mean, you know, every TribalCouncil I look at the jury, and"
497,00:31:02.29,00:31:05.17,"I see all the people that Itrusted, and so, you know, I'm"
498,00:31:05.17,00:31:09.50,really fighting for them.I'm fighting for the Galu tribe
499,00:31:09.50,00:31:11.75,that flourished in the firsthalf of this game and
500,00:31:11.75,00:31:14.12,floundered in the second half.So it's definitely the
501,00:31:14.12,00:31:16.62,"motivation for me to keeppushing, to keep fighting, and"
502,00:31:16.62,00:31:20.17,let the purple win.>> Marisa.
503,00:31:20.17,00:31:21.83,>> Marisa!>> Marisa!
504,00:31:21.83,00:31:24.92,>> I really believe if Iwouldn't have got rid of her
505,00:31:24.92,00:31:28.96,"first, I wouldn't be here today.>> The men in my tribe really"
506,00:31:28.96,00:31:31.96,came gunning for me.They were really scared of
507,00:31:31.96,00:31:34.50,having any strong women ontheir tribe and I was the
508,00:31:34.50,00:31:37.12,"strongest woman on our tribe,period."
509,00:31:37.12,00:31:39.46,And so I learned a great dealabout myself.
510,00:31:39.46,00:31:42.33,Being a strong woman is waymore important than getting any
511,00:31:42.33,00:31:49.54,kind of validation from a man.>> Mike Borassi.
512,00:31:49.54,00:31:51.46,>> Wow.>> This is one of the most
513,00:31:51.46,00:31:54.17,headstrong competitors I thinkon Foa Foa.
514,00:31:54.17,00:31:56.62,"He wasn't going to hear ""no."">> You know, he didn't even get"
515,00:31:56.62,00:31:58.88,to play the game.That's what sad about that.
516,00:31:58.88,00:32:01.96,>> Yeah.>> I underestimated the
517,00:32:01.96,00:32:05.88,conditions and how severe itcan get.
518,00:32:05.88,00:32:09.58,It's a thousand times harderthan I thought it would be.
519,00:32:09.58,00:32:12.79,"But I not only held my own.I made them respect me, and"
520,00:32:12.79,00:32:15.38,"that's the whole thing.You never give up, and you go"
521,00:32:15.38,00:32:24.25,"down swinging.>> Oh, Betsy."
522,00:32:24.25,00:32:27.04,">> The only thing that I didn'tlike is she told me was,"
523,00:32:27.04,00:32:30.04,"""Russell, you're playing thisgame too hard."""
524,00:32:30.04,00:32:32.67,"You know what?If you only play it 50%, even"
525,00:32:32.67,00:32:36.00,"starting at day one, this iswhere you end up."
526,00:32:36.00,00:32:42.25,>> I think being here rekindledthe desire to push myself to
527,00:32:42.25,00:32:47.21,the limits that I lost before Ihad kids.
528,00:32:47.21,00:32:51.96,"So now I tapped into that, andI feel like a breath of fresh"
529,00:32:51.96,00:32:57.67,air.>> Ben.
530,00:32:57.67,00:33:00.04,">> Oh, Ben.>> I think he had no idea how"
531,00:33:00.04,00:33:02.42,to play it socially.>> Right.
532,00:33:02.42,00:33:05.12,>> None.>> I wasn't sorry to see him go.
533,00:33:05.12,00:33:07.38,>> I think I'm a littlemisinterpreted.
534,00:33:07.38,00:33:09.67,I was very brutally honest witheverybody.
535,00:33:09.67,00:33:11.50,People can't handle that.They don't want to hear about
536,00:33:11.50,00:33:13.17,themselves.They don't want to hear the
537,00:33:13.17,00:33:15.08,truth because the truth hurts.I'm truthful with myself.
538,00:33:15.08,00:33:18.21,I know myself.And if the survival aspect of
539,00:33:18.21,00:33:21.88,"this game was just survival, Iwould kill all these people."
540,00:33:23.33,00:33:26.00,"Our girl, Yas!>> Yasmin!"
541,00:33:26.00,00:33:28.75,">> That girl is just such a--such a  character, such a"
542,00:33:28.75,00:33:32.17,"crack-up.>> At the end of the day, the"
543,00:33:32.17,00:33:34.42,girl from the 'hood did dopretty good.
544,00:33:34.42,00:33:36.46,I learned to keep trustingmyself.
545,00:33:36.46,00:33:38.54,That is something I willcontinue to do and I also
546,00:33:38.54,00:33:41.50,"learned one other thing, Iwon't be going camping."
547,00:33:41.50,00:33:45.21,(laughing)>> Ashley.
548,00:33:45.21,00:33:47.75,>> She was my little sister.I loved her.

550,00:33:52.92,00:33:55.50,didn't work.I got played.
551,00:33:55.50,00:33:59.29,"Russell made an alliance withevery single person, and he's a"
552,00:33:59.29,00:34:01.96,snake.And he called the shots.
553,00:34:01.96,00:34:05.92,"If he wanted you out, you wereout."
554,00:34:05.92,00:34:09.12,">> Big Russ, the heart and soulto the Galu tribe."
555,00:34:09.12,00:34:12.08,You guys don't know.This is the man that propelled
556,00:34:12.08,00:34:15.42,us to so many victories.>> Tenacious.
557,00:34:15.42,00:34:17.17,That guy was tenacious inchallenges.
558,00:34:17.17,00:34:20.42,"I mean, we hated to see him go,but stoked to see him go as"

560,00:34:23.33,00:34:27.62,for medical reasons is the mostdemoralizing thing I've ever
561,00:34:27.62,00:34:29.92,felt.I believe a man is supposed to
562,00:34:29.92,00:34:33.08,provide for his family.I was going to win that million

754,00:49:38.17,00:49:40.04,"walk in with that?>> I think they're going to be,"
755,00:49:40.04,00:49:42.38,"like, ticked in a way, butthen..."
756,00:49:42.38,00:49:44.58,>> I think they're going to sayit's fitting.
757,00:49:44.58,00:49:46.92,"You know, I've played itstrategically the whole time,"
758,00:49:46.92,00:49:49.58,and then at the very end whenthe biggest threat that I had to
759,00:49:49.58,00:49:55.04,"me to win the money, I had tobeat, and I did."
760,00:49:55.04,00:49:58.17,"So, you know, it's going to bepart of my speech now."
761,00:49:58.17,00:50:01.00,>> Yeah.>> Throw me the coconut over
762,00:50:01.00,00:50:05.21,"there, would you?>> I wish I was like him when I"
763,00:50:05.21,00:50:07.62,was his age.You know what I mean?
764,00:50:07.62,00:50:10.21,He's the kind of guy that Iwant my daughters to meet one
765,00:50:10.21,00:50:12.17,"day.You know, really."
766,00:50:12.17,00:50:14.42,">> Yes, you would.He will be a fantastic husband"
767,00:50:14.42,00:50:18.00,and father.He's just a great kid.
768,00:50:18.00,00:50:22.42,">> I made a promise to Brett,telling him that me, Brett, and"
769,00:50:22.42,00:50:25.46,Natalie will go to the finalthree.
770,00:50:25.46,00:50:28.42,"But, you see, I made a promiseto Mick, too."
771,00:50:28.42,00:50:33.21,"So either way I slice it, if Ibreak my promise with somebody,"
772,00:50:33.21,00:50:35.12,"I'll be putting them on thejury, they'll taking it"
773,00:50:35.12,00:50:39.33,personal-- that hates me.This is where the game gets
774,00:50:39.33,00:50:45.21,"tough.>> What's going on, guys?"
775,00:50:45.21,00:50:48.12,>> What?>> There some funny business
776,00:50:48.12,00:50:51.21,going on?>> Uh-uh. What do you mean?
777,00:50:51.21,00:50:53.08,">> I don't know, I've neverseen Russell want to go get"
778,00:50:53.08,00:50:55.08,"wood.Maybe I'm just, I'm kind of a"
779,00:50:55.08,00:50:58.08,"skeptic, I guess.I just don't really-- I don't"
780,00:50:58.08,00:51:00.46,"know.>> No matter what, we get to be"
781,00:51:00.46,00:51:02.75,clean tomorrow.>> At some point.
782,00:51:02.75,00:51:04.54,>> And eat.Eat and be clean.
783,00:51:04.54,00:51:07.54,>> I almost want to cry.>> I know.
784,00:51:08.88,00:51:11.17,">> See? What's going on?>> Mick, you're fine."
785,00:51:11.17,00:51:13.58,Do not-- you're the mostparanoid person.
786,00:51:13.58,00:51:17.54,>> I've never seen Russell goget firewood ever in 39 days.
787,00:51:17.54,00:51:19.12,>> Mick.Yeah?
788,00:51:19.12,00:51:22.62,You are so paranoid.Have I let you down yet?
789,00:51:22.62,00:51:24.88,Have I?>> Everybody's talking about me.
790,00:51:24.88,00:51:26.67,>> Are you on drugs?Do you honestly think any of us
791,00:51:26.67,00:51:28.46,want to go against him onthe jury?
792,00:51:28.46,00:51:30.12,"No!>> I wouldn't think so, but"
793,00:51:30.12,00:51:33.29,Russ has all these littlestrange plans and ploys.
794,00:51:33.29,00:51:35.96,">> No, no, Mick.It's done."
795,00:51:35.96,00:51:37.21,"It's a done deal.>> Good, man."
796,00:51:37.21,00:51:40.17,">> You're coming back heretonight, and so am I, and so is"
797,00:51:40.17,00:51:42.83,Russell.It's the three of us.
798,00:51:42.83,00:51:49.62,We're coming back here.>> You know that I made a deal
799,00:51:49.62,00:51:53.29,with you.The problem I'm weighing in my
800,00:51:53.29,00:51:56.50,mind is I made a deal witheverybody.
801,00:51:56.50,00:52:00.04,And you're the kind of guy Iwant my kids to marry.
802,00:52:00.04,00:52:02.96,You're the kind of guy I wantmy daughters-- I wish I was
803,00:52:02.96,00:52:05.67,like you when I was your age.And I ain't just saying that.
804,00:52:05.67,00:52:10.25,>> And I appreciate that.>> So the only option we have is
805,00:52:10.25,00:52:17.88,"Natalie is going to vote you,and Mick is going to vote you."
806,00:52:17.88,00:52:21.12,If I vote Mick...>> And I vote Mick.
807,00:52:21.12,00:52:23.88,">> ...and you vote Mick, thenit's a 2-2 tie."
808,00:52:23.88,00:52:26.04,">> Yeah.>> And then it's a challenge, it"
809,00:52:26.04,00:52:28.33,might be a fire challenge.Do you think you could beat
810,00:52:28.33,00:52:30.67,Mick in a fire challenge?It's like you still have
811,00:52:30.67,00:52:33.08,another challenge.You're still working your way
812,00:52:33.08,00:52:36.08,to the end?>> Yeah.
813,00:52:40.12,00:52:45.38,>> Russell and I have talkedover agreements for each other
814,00:52:45.38,00:52:49.00,previously in this game.It's hard to take his word 100%
815,00:52:49.00,00:52:51.88,and know that he's going tostick behind it.
816,00:52:51.88,00:52:54.58,"All I can really do right nowis hope that he's, you know, a"
817,00:52:54.58,00:52:58.58,"man of his word, and will fallback on his actions."
818,00:53:02.17,00:53:04.12,>> I've been wearing anecklace-for a long time in
819,00:53:04.12,00:53:06.42,this game.The hidden immunity idol.
820,00:53:06.42,00:53:10.17,And I finally get the real deal.Definitely better late than
821,00:53:10.17,00:53:12.38,"never, because look whereit came."
822,00:53:12.38,00:53:15.21,It came on the last one.The one that puts me in front
823,00:53:15.21,00:53:24.88,"of the jury to win this game.Right now, you have to worry"
824,00:53:24.88,00:53:27.96,about jury votes.And that's all I'm thinking
825,00:53:27.96,00:53:31.58,about right now.How can I get more jury votes?
826,00:53:31.58,00:53:35.92,Brett's a real good guy.I like Brett a lot.
827,00:53:35.92,00:53:39.38,"Mick, he's a good guy, too.But I'm playing a game."
828,00:53:39.38,00:53:43.54,I'm still strongly consideringkeeping Brett.
829,00:53:43.54,00:53:47.04,May the best man win.Everybody would be shocked if I
830,00:53:47.04,00:53:48.96,did that.But you know what?
831,00:53:48.96,00:53:52.04,I think that might get me juryvotes-- keeping the strongest
832,00:53:52.04,00:53:54.71,here.My head's spinning now.
833,00:53:54.71,00:53:57.83,It gets tougher and tougher.Every time you think it can't
834,00:53:57.83,00:54:01.21,"get any tougher than this, butnow I'm damned if I do and I'm"
835,00:54:01.21,00:54:26.21,damned if I don't.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
836,00:54:26.21,00:54:31.38,the members of our jury.Erik.
837,00:54:31.38,00:54:34.38,Kelly.Laura.
838,00:54:34.38,00:54:37.08,John.Dave.
839,00:54:37.08,00:54:40.58,Monica.Shambo.
840,00:54:40.58,00:54:43.88,"And Jaison, voted out at thelast Tribal Council."
841,00:54:48.25,00:54:52.71,"So let's talk about today, yourfinal immunity challenge."
842,00:54:52.71,00:54:56.04,"Mick, you're out first, Natalieright behind."
843,00:54:56.04,00:55:00.00,Leaves us with the showdown.Russell and Brett.
844,00:55:00.00,00:55:03.62,"Russell, this had to be how youwanted it to go down, going up"
845,00:55:03.62,00:55:08.21,against a guy who's been a verystrong competitor in this game.
846,00:55:08.21,00:55:11.25,>> Definitely.I knew he would be the one that
847,00:55:11.25,00:55:14.38,"would be there with me at theend, and I thought, I lose, I"
848,00:55:14.38,00:55:16.96,go home.I came to win.
849,00:55:16.96,00:55:19.12,I didn't come to even comesecond.
850,00:55:19.12,00:55:22.46,So I put more effort into thischallenge than I have into
851,00:55:22.46,00:55:26.33,"anything in this entire game.>> PROBST: Brett, did you figure"
852,00:55:26.33,00:55:29.04,it would be Russell that mightbe the one to give you a run
853,00:55:29.04,00:55:30.96,"for your money?>> Oh, yeah, I mean without"
854,00:55:30.96,00:55:33.21,a doubt.He's got the mentality that is
855,00:55:33.21,00:55:35.17,"""I have to win.""and that's the mindset I've"
856,00:55:35.17,00:55:37.88,been having the past fewimmunity challenges.
857,00:55:37.88,00:55:40.08,">> PROBST: Mick, the minuteBrett goes out of this challenge"
858,00:55:40.08,00:55:43.04,"and he's vulnerable, did youknow that's it, he's going home?"
859,00:55:43.04,00:55:45.96,">> Yeah, absolutely, right away.You know what I mean."
860,00:55:45.96,00:55:49.42,"He's been such a competitor,but it was a huge relief."
861,00:55:49.42,00:55:51.71,">> PROBST: Natalie, no doubt inyour mind?"
862,00:55:51.71,00:55:55.33,Easy decision?>> Yes. Absolutely.
863,00:55:55.33,00:55:57.58,">> PROBST: Now, Russell, isthere a part of you that can"
864,00:55:57.58,00:56:00.17,appreciate the competitor inBrett?
865,00:56:00.17,00:56:03.29,The guy has lasted a long timewith the odds against him.
866,00:56:03.29,00:56:06.21,>> Right.He played a great game.
867,00:56:06.21,00:56:09.17,"And it's because I respect thegame so much, he deserves to be"
868,00:56:09.17,00:56:13.33,"sitting up there with me.I mean, you know, we're"
869,00:56:13.33,00:56:17.12,probably the two best up here.And you want the best with you
870,00:56:17.12,00:56:19.88,"to talk in front of jury.You know, that's just how it"
871,00:56:19.88,00:56:22.79,"should be.>> PROBST: Mick, surprised by"
872,00:56:22.79,00:56:26.88,Russell's comment about maybeit's fair to take Brett to the
873,00:56:26.88,00:56:30.33,end because he's earned it morethan somebody else up here?
874,00:56:30.33,00:56:32.75,">> Yeah, I think he makes apretty good case."
875,00:56:32.75,00:56:36.29,"I mean, it's not one I wouldagree with per se."
876,00:56:36.29,00:56:39.62,I would tend to think theopposite.
877,00:56:39.62,00:56:42.08,"You know, Brett going in frontof that jury, none of us have a"
878,00:56:42.08,00:56:45.17,"chance at a million bucks.>> PROBST: Natalie, a little"
879,00:56:45.17,00:56:47.83,"surprised?>> No, actually, I'm not"
880,00:56:47.83,00:56:51.00,"surprised.Because, again, Brett has been"
881,00:56:51.00,00:56:55.21,an outstanding competitor.But Russell knows
882,00:56:55.21,00:56:59.25,"strategically, it's not a goodmove at all to take Brett and"
883,00:56:59.25,00:57:02.46,"put Brett in front of the jury.>> PROBST: Brett, do you sense a"
884,00:57:02.46,00:57:05.21,little bit of worry fromNatalie and Mick?
885,00:57:05.21,00:57:07.46,"I'm even hearing it, Natalie,right now, almost like she's"
886,00:57:07.46,00:57:10.08,"talking to Russell saying, ""Youknow that's not a good move,"
887,00:57:10.08,00:57:13.17,"right?"">> Well, I mean, if Russ truly"
888,00:57:13.17,00:57:16.42,"felt that he wanted to go upagainst the best, you know,"
889,00:57:16.42,00:57:19.17,they've got to be a littleworried.
890,00:57:19.17,00:57:22.21,">> PROBST: If Russell made avote to keep you in the game, do"
891,00:57:22.21,00:57:26.17,you think Russell then earnsrespect from the jury?
892,00:57:26.17,00:57:27.83,">> Oh, yeah.Most definitely."
893,00:57:27.83,00:57:30.92,"I mean, by that action, you'reshowing a sense of confidence"
894,00:57:30.92,00:57:34.38,"within yourself and shows quitea bit of character to say, hey,"
895,00:57:34.38,00:57:37.71,"you might beat me at this, butI'm going to put you up against"
896,00:57:37.71,00:57:43.38,me and we'll put it to the test.>> PROBST: So based on what I'm
897,00:57:43.38,00:57:46.54,"hearing you guys say, what atone point was an absolute"
898,00:57:46.54,00:57:50.58,"certainty, Brett going home,now has a bit of suspense."
899,00:57:50.58,00:57:53.75,We'll see how it plays out.Russell has the individual
900,00:57:53.75,00:57:56.21,immunity necklace.I know you're not giving it up.
901,00:57:56.21,00:58:00.08,You cannot vote for Russell.Everybody else is fair game.
902,00:58:00.08,00:58:13.25,"Mick, you're up.>> Hell of a competitor, man."
903,00:58:13.25,00:58:16.38,Props to you.I got nothing but love for you.
904,00:58:28.62,00:58:32.46,">> (whispers): Brett, I'm votingfor you because we have no shot"
905,00:58:32.46,00:58:41.62,at beating you at the final.>> PROBST: Russell.
906,00:58:57.79,00:59:14.08,"I'll go tally the votes.Once the votes are read, the"
907,00:59:14.08,00:59:16.62,decision is final.The person voted out will be

909,00:59:18.88,00:59:25.50,I'll read the votes.First vote...

914,00:59:57.21,01:00:00.117,"jury, Brett.You need to bring me your torch."
915,01:00:07.83,01:00:14.46,"Brett, the tribe has spoken.>> Great game, guys."
916,01:00:14.46,01:00:17.71,">> Bye, Brett.>> Thanks for the adventure."
917,01:00:23.38,01:00:27.67,">> PROBST: Well, you have gone afar as you can go in this game."
918,01:00:27.67,01:00:31.62,Tomorrow you will get a chanceto plead your case to the jury
919,01:00:31.62,01:00:34.92,about why you deserve themillion dollars and the title

927,01:01:06.17,01:01:09.00,one of the final four.It was definitely a testament
928,01:01:09.00,01:01:12.21,"to my will and hard work, andkind of felt like I went out on"
929,01:01:12.21,01:01:44.12,my own accord to some degree.>> I can't wait to brush and

938,01:02:18.71,01:02:21.75,">> Yes, indeed.I think we need a toast."
939,01:02:21.75,01:02:24.71,"Final three.>> Final three, Foa Foa."
940,01:02:24.71,01:02:27.17,>> From the get-go.>> May the best man win.
941,01:02:27.17,01:02:31.12,"You know, I said from day one Iwas gonna get here,"
942,01:02:31.12,01:02:33.08,and here I am.>> Wow. Very good.
943,01:02:33.08,01:02:37.04,"Isn't that great?>> Not only did I get here,"
944,01:02:37.04,01:02:42.25,I brought two people here thatI wanted to be here with me.
945,01:02:44.54,01:02:47.08,They're gonna say I took youthe whole way.
946,01:02:47.08,01:02:49.54,They're gonna say youcouldn't have made it without
947,01:02:49.54,01:02:52.25,Russell.What you gonna say?
948,01:02:52.25,01:02:54.25,>> It's in God's hand at thispoint.
949,01:02:54.25,01:02:56.33,"If I'm not meant to win,that's fine."
950,01:02:56.33,01:02:58.04,I'm happy I made itto the third.
951,01:02:58.04,01:03:00.29,">> You see, you haven't beenthinking about your speech too"
952,01:03:00.29,01:03:04.88,"much, then.>> Russell, no, I... "
953,01:03:08.29,01:03:10.17,All of them questions.>> Guess what.
954,01:03:10.17,01:03:12.29,Look who I aligned withfrom the first day.
955,01:03:12.29,01:03:15.38,">> Oh, you, so you sayingyou set up the alliance."
956,01:03:15.38,01:03:19.25,>> No. Okay.>> So what did do you
957,01:03:19.25,01:03:22.50,"strategically in this game?If you want second place, you"
958,01:03:22.50,01:03:27.17,have to do better than that.>> What about Mick?
959,01:03:27.17,01:03:31.17,"He was the nice guy, you know.>> Well, don't think I'm going"
960,01:03:31.17,01:03:34.21,"to eat up on that, too.I'm just saying, here behind me"
961,01:03:34.21,01:03:37.25,I have sitting the nice guy andthe nice girl.
962,01:03:37.25,01:03:42.08,Have they outwitted me?Have they outplayed me?
963,01:03:42.08,01:03:45.04,"If they have, then give themthe money because"
964,01:03:45.04,01:03:49.08,"they deserve it, so...>> Russell has good points,"
965,01:03:49.08,01:03:52.17,but he needs to be remindedthat he couldn't have done this
966,01:03:52.17,01:03:55.58,"without us.I was a trustworthy,"
967,01:03:55.58,01:03:59.04,"hardworking, likable guy, and Igot to the same place"
968,01:03:59.04,01:04:01.58,ultimately that Russell did.We just took totally different
969,01:04:01.58,01:04:04.17,"paths to do it.So, you know, some people may"
970,01:04:04.17,01:04:06.04,"say, ""Well, I liked your path a""little better."
971,01:04:06.04,01:04:20.46,"Here's my vote."">> Ease up..."
972,01:04:20.46,01:04:24.08,please.I think there may be a little
973,01:04:24.08,01:04:26.62,bit of strategy involved toRussell making us feel like
974,01:04:26.62,01:04:29.71,"we're not gonna win or thatwe don't have a chance, but I"
975,01:04:29.71,01:04:33.29,"have news for him.I'm not gonna give up, and I'll"
976,01:04:33.29,01:04:36.08,"just explain to the jury,I don't work the same way as"
977,01:04:36.08,01:04:37.79,Russell.That would clearly not have
978,01:04:37.79,01:04:39.83,"worked for me.The girls that were aggressive,"
979,01:04:39.83,01:04:43.75,"they got eliminated early.My strategy was to be myself,"
980,01:04:43.75,01:04:47.21,"and at the end of the day, youknow, I wasn't out to get"
981,01:04:47.21,01:04:48.83,anybody or make anybody looklook bad.
982,01:04:48.83,01:04:51.33,Russell made it clear he wasokay with making people
983,01:04:51.33,01:05:11.71,look bad.(chuckles)
984,01:05:19.21,01:05:21.58,>> I never want to sleep onbamboo ever again.
985,01:05:21.58,01:05:24.50,">> Hell, no.I'm not gonna be rained on"
986,01:05:24.50,01:05:26.08,"ever again.>> Me, either!"
987,01:05:26.08,01:05:29.08,>> I'm not sleeping in thecold ever again.
988,01:05:29.08,01:05:40.92,Toss it up.This is the best fire we've
989,01:05:40.92,01:05:45.00,"had yet.>> Burn, baby, burn."
990,01:05:45.00,01:05:49.17,>> Whoo!>> If Mick or Natalie won this
991,01:05:49.17,01:05:53.25,"game over me, that would justbe a shame."
992,01:05:53.25,01:05:56.04,"You know, it wouldn't make anysense to me."
993,01:05:56.04,01:05:58.46,I played this gamestrategically better than
994,01:05:58.46,01:06:03.75,"anybody, maybe in history.I really think this jury's"
995,01:06:03.75,01:06:06.71,gonna put my name down.I've accomplished the
996,01:06:06.71,01:06:09.88,impossible out hereall by myself and brought
997,01:06:09.88,01:06:13.92,a couple of bums with me.I feel strong.
998,01:06:13.92,01:06:16.17,I feel good.I feel like I'm gonna go
999,01:06:16.17,01:06:20.42,"into this, make a great speech,and take it."
1000,01:06:44.50,01:06:49.12,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of our jury:
1001,01:06:49.12,01:06:51.38,Erik.Kelly.
1002,01:06:51.38,01:06:54.17,Laura.John.
1003,01:06:54.17,01:06:56.17,Dave.Monica.
1004,01:06:56.17,01:07:00.88,"Shambo.Jaison and Brett, voted out at"
1005,01:07:00.88,01:07:08.17,"the last Tribal Council.Well, congratulations on making"
1006,01:07:08.17,01:07:13.25,"it to the final three.Tonight, the power in this game"
1007,01:07:13.25,01:07:17.54,shifts to the jury.Nine people that you had a hand
1008,01:07:17.54,01:07:21.08,in voting out now control yourfate in their hands.
1009,01:07:21.08,01:07:25.25,Very unique situation thisseason in that all three of you
1010,01:07:25.25,01:07:28.38,voted for every single personon the jury.
1011,01:07:28.38,01:07:33.96,So nobody has anywhere to hide.You will each get an opening
1012,01:07:33.96,01:07:36.08,statement.This is your chance to convince
1013,01:07:36.08,01:07:39.83,them why you deserve it.The jury will then get a chance
1014,01:07:39.83,01:07:41.92,to address you.They're gonna be trying to
1015,01:07:41.92,01:07:44.67,gather information to help themdecide who they think is most
1016,01:07:44.67,01:07:48.08,worthy of the title of solesurvivor and the million-dollar
1017,01:07:48.08,01:07:51.71,check that goes along with it.Then we will vote.
1018,01:07:51.71,01:07:55.83,Everybody ready to get to it?>> Yeah.
1019,01:07:55.83,01:07:59.75,">> PROBST: Opening statements.Mick, you're up."
1020,01:07:59.75,01:08:02.38,">> All right.Uh, good evening, everyone."
1021,01:08:02.38,01:08:06.46,"You know, I came into this gamerealizing that under the stress"
1022,01:08:06.46,01:08:09.88,of this whole process thatthere would be a lot of
1023,01:08:09.88,01:08:13.75,pressure to sort of giveyourself a little more moral
1024,01:08:13.75,01:08:18.38,sort of leeway than maybe I waswilling to give.
1025,01:08:18.38,01:08:22.17,"As underdogs coming in, I thinkthat temptation is especially"
1026,01:08:22.17,01:08:26.29,strong to do whatever it takesto keep your head above water.
1027,01:08:26.29,01:08:30.21,I just played my whole gamewithin sort of these parameters
1028,01:08:30.21,01:08:33.79,I really wasn't that willing togo outside of.
1029,01:08:33.79,01:08:36.58,I made it a point not topromise too much.
1030,01:08:36.58,01:08:40.17,"Not to overtly stomp on, lie ormislead people or to treat them"
1031,01:08:40.17,01:08:44.25,like sort of pawns in this game.The fact that I was able to get
1032,01:08:44.25,01:08:47.62,"this far by doing that,you know, that was kind of my"
1033,01:08:47.62,01:08:51.50,"goal in this, and I feel like Iaccomplished it."
1034,01:08:54.29,01:08:56.92,">> PROBST: Natalie, your openingstatement."
1035,01:08:56.92,01:09:00.21,">> You know, I came into thisgame with a lot of people"
1036,01:09:00.21,01:09:03.25,"telling me before I ever came,""What are you doing?"
1037,01:09:03.25,01:09:06.08,"""You're crazy.You can't do it."""
1038,01:09:06.08,01:09:10.38,"And I knew I would wake up everysingle day, if I didn't come do"
1039,01:09:10.38,01:09:13.50,"this, I would have regrets.And for me, it was definitely"
1040,01:09:13.50,01:09:18.29,"about wanting to, um, just gainthe confidence to go outside my"
1041,01:09:18.29,01:09:20.83,comfort zone.This is the hardest thing I've
1042,01:09:20.83,01:09:24.21,"ever done mentally, physically,emotionally."
1043,01:09:24.21,01:09:26.50,This experience has been veryhumbling for me.
1044,01:09:26.50,01:09:29.92,"And without each and every oneof you, I would not be sitting"
1045,01:09:29.92,01:09:31.79,sitting here.I appreciate it.
1046,01:09:31.79,01:09:36.21,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Russell, your opening"
1047,01:09:36.21,01:09:39.17,statement.>> Mine's going to be a little
1048,01:09:39.17,01:09:42.46,bit different than these two.I came here to do what I said I
1049,01:09:42.46,01:09:45.17,was going to do and try to makeif all the way to the top and
1050,01:09:45.17,01:09:48.08,win the game.I made huge strategic moves all
1051,01:09:48.08,01:09:51.08,the way through the game.My first strategic moves were
1052,01:09:51.08,01:09:54.58,in my own tribe.Marisa and Betsy.
1053,01:09:54.58,01:09:56.54,"Those were the two that said""Get rid of Russell."
1054,01:09:56.54,01:09:58.79,"Get rid of Russell.""Guess who goes first?"
1055,01:09:58.79,01:10:02.33,"Marisa and Betsy.When we go to Galu, I have"
1056,01:10:02.33,01:10:06.92,these guys right here behind mewhile I'm getting shot at.
1057,01:10:06.92,01:10:11.25,I solidified myself with Shamboto get rid of Kelly.
1058,01:10:11.25,01:10:14.88,It was a huge move.It didn't change the game yet.
1059,01:10:14.88,01:10:17.46,Laura was the biggest move Ithink of the game.
1060,01:10:17.46,01:10:21.00,"I had to go to John and say,""John, if you help switch your"
1061,01:10:21.00,01:10:24.21,"vote, I'll vote off a Foa Foamember."""
1062,01:10:24.21,01:10:27.54,So he agrees.He switches his vote at the end.
1063,01:10:27.54,01:10:29.96,Laura goes home.Then John comes to me after
1064,01:10:29.96,01:10:32.08,"it's over, ""We've got to getrid of a Foa Foa."""
1065,01:10:32.08,01:10:35.12,"Well, I can't do that, so Ihave to get rid of John."
1066,01:10:35.12,01:10:37.92,Then it just went like dominoesfrom there.
1067,01:10:37.92,01:10:41.08,"The huge move was the mostdifficult, trying to get rid of"
1068,01:10:41.08,01:10:43.08,Brett.He won three immunity idols in
1069,01:10:43.08,01:10:46.54,a row.So I have to win physically to
1070,01:10:46.54,01:10:51.08,"get rid of Brett.Now, I ask you, if either one"
1071,01:10:51.08,01:10:54.54,"of these outwit me, then givethem the money."
1072,01:10:54.54,01:10:57.58,"If either one of theseout-played me, then give them"
1073,01:10:57.58,01:11:00.12,the game.But you know what?
1074,01:11:00.12,01:11:04.04,I don't think that they have.The truth is where it lies.
1075,01:11:04.04,01:11:07.25,"It's y'all's big decision tomake tonight, and may the best"
1076,01:11:07.25,01:11:11.33,"man win.>> PROBST: All right, three very"
1077,01:11:11.33,01:11:15.04,"different opening statements.Jury, in a moment, you're going"
1078,01:11:15.04,01:11:18.79,"to get your first chance toaddress Mick, Natalie, and"
1079,01:11:18.79,01:11:20.92,Russell.I'll give you minute to think
1080,01:11:20.92,01:11:36.04,"about what you want to ask them.>> PROBST: All right, jury."
1081,01:11:36.04,01:11:38.54,"You've heard the openingstatements from Mick, Natalie,"
1082,01:11:38.54,01:11:40.88,and Russell.It's now your first chance to
1083,01:11:40.88,01:11:43.25,address them.You're trying to gather
1084,01:11:43.25,01:11:46.29,information to help you make amillion-dollar decision.
1085,01:11:46.29,01:11:49.58,Let's get started.Jaison.
1086,01:11:49.58,01:11:57.92,"You're up first.>> Well, congratulations."
1087,01:11:57.92,01:12:01.88,I'm going to give you guys anopportunity to look at the jury
1088,01:12:01.88,01:12:06.04,"and give them some informationabout who you really are, and"
1089,01:12:06.04,01:12:09.38,"if you don't, I will.>> I'll start."
1090,01:12:09.38,01:12:11.46,>> Go ahead.>> I was in pharmaceutical
1091,01:12:11.46,01:12:14.54,"sales before I came.I gave up my job, so"
1092,01:12:14.54,01:12:18.79,"technically, I am unemployed atthis time but that is my dream"
1093,01:12:18.79,01:12:20.79,job.I want to find one when I go
1094,01:12:20.79,01:12:23.08,back home.>> Russell?
1095,01:12:23.08,01:12:26.67,>> I'm a businessman.I opened a business five years
1096,01:12:26.67,01:12:30.12,"ago, struggled for three years,just became successful with the"
1097,01:12:30.12,01:12:33.54,business for two years.This is the first business that
1098,01:12:33.54,01:12:36.25,I have succeeded with.That's what I do.
1099,01:12:36.25,01:12:39.00,>> Mick?>> I finished medical school.
1100,01:12:39.00,01:12:43.71,I'm 320 odd grand in debt fromthat.
1101,01:12:43.71,01:12:46.29,And it's going to take me along time to pull out of debt.
1102,01:12:46.29,01:12:50.29,"I'm almost 35, and that's me.>> I don't think any of them"
1103,01:12:50.29,01:12:53.25,"have lied.But Natalie, you know, neglects"
1104,01:12:53.25,01:12:56.25,to tell you that she has made alot of money.
1105,01:12:56.25,01:12:59.04,"Russell, probably thewealthiest guy on this panel,"
1106,01:12:59.04,01:13:01.92,"seven figures in the last yearor so, he says."
1107,01:13:01.92,01:13:05.12,"You know, Mick, doctors do getpaid very well, especially when"
1108,01:13:05.12,01:13:07.62,you get fellowships at one ofthe most prestigious hospitals
1109,01:13:07.62,01:13:11.08,"in America.So whatever decision is made,"
1110,01:13:11.08,01:13:14.04,no one is broke.I think you guys should look to
1111,01:13:14.04,01:13:16.42,other criteria.That's all I have to say.
1112,01:13:16.42,01:13:22.25,">> PROBST: Thanks, Jaison.Shambo, you're up."
1113,01:13:22.25,01:13:26.54,">> Hi, guys.I would just like to apologize"
1114,01:13:26.54,01:13:31.50,to America for dismantling Galubecause I'm really questioning
1115,01:13:31.50,01:13:33.92,that judgment call at thispoint.
1116,01:13:33.92,01:13:38.25,"Mick, wow.Dude, you have got to be"
1117,01:13:38.25,01:13:42.04,"kidding me.In a word, would you agree that"
1118,01:13:42.04,01:13:45.79,your overall game playing couldbe called...
1119,01:13:45.79,01:13:48.12,>> Here it comes.>> ...feckless.

1122,01:13:53.67,01:13:56.25,">> Well, I think that's a reallygood idea after this is over."
1123,01:13:56.25,01:13:59.00,"I'm done with you.>> Okay, will do, Shambo."

1128,01:14:12.21,01:14:15.17,going to perceive you sittingup there in the final three?
1129,01:14:15.17,01:14:17.17,"Give it to me, Natalie.>> I think America is going to"
1130,01:14:17.17,01:14:21.12,say she came the mostill-equipped in a sundress and

1133,01:14:26.12,01:14:30.17,"intuition to notice that girlthat goes out aggressive,"
1134,01:14:30.17,01:14:33.38,"target, gone.Marisa and Betsy."
1135,01:14:33.38,01:14:36.29,That's not smart.>> I'm calling just major B.S.

1138,01:14:40.88,01:14:43.62,>> Okay.>> The jig is up.
1139,01:14:43.62,01:14:48.29,"Natalie, Mick, no way in God'sgreen Earth you're getting my"
1140,01:14:48.29,01:14:50.17,my vote.Thanks for playing.
1141,01:14:50.17,01:14:53.42,">> Thank you, Sham.>> Thank you."

1146,01:15:07.25,01:15:10.67,"So, Mick, imagine for a momentyou and I are going on a little"
1147,01:15:10.67,01:15:13.29,bro-date together.What kind of stuff-- what
1148,01:15:13.29,01:15:15.38,"kind of stuff would we do?>> Wait, wait, wait, what is it?"
1149,01:15:15.38,01:15:17.92,>> You and I are going to go ona bro date together.
1150,01:15:17.92,01:15:20.08,Nothing sexual.Just a little guy time.
1151,01:15:20.08,01:15:23.21,So describe what that day wouldentail.
1152,01:15:23.21,01:15:25.00,>> I'll wake you up with alittle sweet nothing in
1153,01:15:25.00,01:15:26.92,your ear...(laughter)
1154,01:15:26.92,01:15:28.83,>> That's a good beginning.>> ...a little tickle on
1155,01:15:28.83,01:15:33.50,"the nose.No, but, uh, no, we'd get up."
1156,01:15:33.50,01:15:37.21,"We'd check out the news, andgrab some eats afterwards, and"
1157,01:15:37.21,01:15:41.42,"you know, just be guys and talkabout girls and, you know,"
1158,01:15:41.42,01:15:44.46,"sports and stuff like that.>> All right, sounds good."
1159,01:15:44.46,01:15:46.71,"It sounds probably like a sillyquestion, but basically the"
1160,01:15:46.71,01:15:50.50,reason I was asking is to see towhat level did you invest with
1161,01:15:50.50,01:15:53.17,myself as a human being.I appreciate your response.
1162,01:15:53.17,01:15:55.25,You're almost done.We'll get some food shortly.
1163,01:15:55.25,01:16:00.21,">> Thanks. Thanks, man.>> PROBST: Kelly."
1164,01:16:00.21,01:16:03.25,">> Hi.Nat, I'm going to start with"
1165,01:16:03.25,01:16:05.79,you.Because I think in the
1166,01:16:05.79,01:16:08.12,"beginning, we were perceived asbeing very similar, you know."
1167,01:16:08.12,01:16:10.12,We were both a little bitunderestimated.
1168,01:16:10.12,01:16:12.88,I had to rely on myself.I was hoping for the same thing
1169,01:16:12.88,01:16:14.75,in you.I don't think you were ever on
1170,01:16:14.75,01:16:17.50,the field.I saw you always turn to call
1171,01:16:17.50,01:16:20.17,"help, whether it be these twoor someone else in every"
1172,01:16:20.17,01:16:22.62,challenge.>> Can I answer to that?
1173,01:16:22.62,01:16:24.71,">> Yeah, go ahead.>> It wasn't because I had no"
1174,01:16:24.71,01:16:27.46,fight.I've given this 100%.
1175,01:16:27.46,01:16:31.75,"Yeah, maybe I'm not as good atsome of the physical challenges"
1176,01:16:31.75,01:16:34.33,as some other people.I think everybody outweighed
1177,01:16:34.33,01:16:38.04,"me, but I did do things on myown, and I'll tell you, I got"
1178,01:16:38.04,01:16:41.121,better throughout the game tobelieve in myself.
1179,01:16:43.92,01:16:48.08,">> Russell, you've said manytimes you're going to lie,"
1180,01:16:48.08,01:16:50.71,"cheat, and steal your waythrough this game."
1181,01:16:50.71,01:16:52.54,Does that apply to yourreal life also?
1182,01:16:52.54,01:16:55.50,">> No, not at all.I am 100% different outside this"
1183,01:16:55.50,01:16:58.12,game.The thing that bothered me is I
1184,01:16:58.12,01:17:02.29,don't want my kids to thinkthat this is how I really am.
1185,01:17:02.29,01:17:05.25,I'm not like this at all.I'm a totally different person
1186,01:17:05.25,01:17:07.21,"outside this game.>> Instead of lie, cheat, and"
1187,01:17:07.21,01:17:10.46,"steal in real life, maybe whatthree words that would replace"
1188,01:17:10.46,01:17:13.12,that?>> It might be hard to believe
1189,01:17:13.12,01:17:16.75,"but honor, integrity, andloyalty."
1190,01:17:19.21,01:17:23.17,">> Russell, it's hard for me tosit here and believe that from"
1191,01:17:23.17,01:17:27.79,"you.""Honor, integrity, and loyalty"""
1192,01:17:27.79,01:17:30.17,is the most important thingto you?
1193,01:17:30.17,01:17:32.75,>> It is the most importantthing to me.
1194,01:17:32.75,01:17:35.67,>> I guess I've heard what Ineed to.
1195,01:17:35.67,01:17:41.17,"Good luck.>> PROBST: Thanks, Kelly."
1196,01:17:41.17,01:17:46.75,"Monica.>> First off, I just want to"
1197,01:17:46.75,01:17:49.42,"say congratulations.Russell, you played some key"
1198,01:17:49.42,01:17:54.25,"moves, and regardless of howyou got there, you're there."
1199,01:17:54.25,01:17:58.25,"Natalie, Mick, both of you seemto have played a pretty honest"
1200,01:17:58.25,01:18:02.12,"game, but I did miss passion.I want to see the fight in your"
1201,01:18:02.12,01:18:07.17,"answer for my question tonight.Mick, tell me why each of the"
1202,01:18:07.17,01:18:11.79,two people alongside you do notdeserve the million dollars and
1203,01:18:11.79,01:18:14.96,"you do.>> You know, I don't think"
1204,01:18:14.96,01:18:17.29,Natalie deserves the money atall.
1205,01:18:17.29,01:18:20.33,"I don't know, you know, whatshe really did along the way"
1206,01:18:20.33,01:18:23.29,except align with Russell.And through their relationship
1207,01:18:23.29,01:18:25.46,"and their trust, was able toget through the game."
1208,01:18:25.46,01:18:28.71,That was it.Russell was willing to lie to
1209,01:18:28.71,01:18:32.54,"people, pit people against eachother, mislead anybody, and all"
1210,01:18:32.54,01:18:35.67,"the while, you know, this giantego just got really kind of out"
1211,01:18:35.67,01:18:38.33,of hand and obsessive and Idon't think that that kind of
1212,01:18:38.33,01:18:41.25,character behavior deserves amillion bucks.
1213,01:18:41.25,01:18:43.83,You don't reward that.>> Can I say something?
1214,01:18:43.83,01:18:46.12,"You know, he's sitting overhere saying I pit people"
1215,01:18:46.12,01:18:48.62,against each other.You pit people against each
1216,01:18:48.62,01:18:50.88,"other, also.>> Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude."
1217,01:18:50.88,01:18:53.00,">> And also, this next thing...>> We're trying to-- I'm "
1218,01:18:53.00,01:18:55.83,answering her question.>> I asked if I could speak.

1221,01:19:01.25,01:19:04.00,>> I never gave you high-fives.>> Natalie didn't mind when I
1222,01:19:04.00,01:19:06.21,was being a snake and giving mehigh-fives when I voted
1223,01:19:06.21,01:19:08.42,everybody off.The two honest people here--
1224,01:19:08.42,01:19:10.75,"they were congratulating me.""Good job."
1225,01:19:10.75,01:19:13.00,"That was probably one of thebest jobs in history, Russell"
1226,01:19:13.00,01:19:14.88,You are doing... you arerunning...
1227,01:19:14.88,01:19:17.17,"You should win this game.You're running the show here."""
1228,01:19:17.17,01:19:19.08,>> You did a great job.Those were great moves.
1229,01:19:19.08,01:19:23.12,>> They both-- they both didn'tmind following the snake right
1230,01:19:23.12,01:19:26.04,behind me the whole step of theway.
1231,01:19:26.04,01:19:31.04,>> I think I'm basically done.>> PROBST: Dave.
1232,01:19:31.04,01:19:33.88,">> Hey, everybody.I do have one thing."
1233,01:19:33.88,01:19:36.04,"I'm curious, I'm just going toask everybody, what do you"
1234,01:19:36.04,01:19:38.79,"think your chances are tonight?What do you think, Mick?"
1235,01:19:38.79,01:19:44.21,">> My chances are, after this,maybe 25%, 20%."
1236,01:19:44.21,01:19:46.33,">> Natalie, what do you thinkyour chances are?"
1237,01:19:46.33,01:19:48.96,>> I'm going with maybe 30.>> 30%?
1238,01:19:48.96,01:19:52.04,">> 30% to 40% chance.>> Right on. Good game, Mama."
1239,01:19:52.04,01:19:54.12,>> Thank you.>> You're welcome. Great job.
1240,01:19:54.12,01:19:58.12,"What do you say, Russ?>> I came in here with a lot"
1241,01:19:58.12,01:20:01.46,larger percentage but it wentdown to about 55%.
1242,01:20:01.46,01:20:03.92,">> 55?>> Yeah, I think that it's..."
1243,01:20:03.92,01:20:06.96,"it just might happen, mightnot happen."
1244,01:20:06.96,01:20:08.88,">> All right, thanks everybody.>> Thanks, Dave."
1245,01:20:08.88,01:20:15.25,">> Yeah, you bet.>> PROBST: Laura, you're up."
1246,01:20:15.25,01:20:20.04,">> Hi.Russell, what did you learn"
1247,01:20:20.04,01:20:23.62,about me that enabled you tobeat me?
1248,01:20:23.62,01:20:27.92,">> I knew immediately you wasthe biggest threat on Galu, and"
1249,01:20:27.92,01:20:31.04,that you were controlling a lot.That's what I thought.
1250,01:20:31.04,01:20:34.04,"Whether that was true or not, Idon't know."
1251,01:20:34.04,01:20:39.42,"But if-if it wouldn't have tookplace like it did, I don't have"
1252,01:20:39.42,01:20:43.12,a doubt in my mind you would behere right now.
1253,01:20:43.12,01:20:48.21,">> PROBST: Thanks, Laura.John, your turn."
1254,01:20:52.04,01:20:56.17,">> Mick, give me the hard sell.Why should I write your name"
1255,01:20:56.17,01:20:58.71,"down?Hard sell, blow my mind"
1256,01:20:58.71,01:21:00.58,right now.>> In terms of character you're
1257,01:21:00.58,01:21:02.58,"not going to find a better,more solid guy up here."
1258,01:21:02.58,01:21:04.67,You're just not.I'm one of those people that
1259,01:21:04.67,01:21:07.54,does not think that the endsjustify the means and you
1260,01:21:07.54,01:21:11.12,don't treat people like pawns.That's not my way of
1261,01:21:11.12,01:21:13.08,maneuvering through life or thegame.
1262,01:21:13.08,01:21:15.04,That's essentially the type ofperson that you're giving
1263,01:21:15.04,01:21:17.25,money to.I don't think you can give it
1264,01:21:17.25,01:21:20.25,to a more stand-up dude up here.I just don't.
1265,01:21:20.25,01:21:23.12,">> Good.Natalie, you admittedly got"
1266,01:21:23.12,01:21:25.62,here tucked under Russell'swing.
1267,01:21:25.62,01:21:28.17,And I value that.But what do you say to the
1268,01:21:28.17,01:21:31.67,"person who's thinking, you knowwhat, you've got to win it"
1269,01:21:31.67,01:21:33.75,"now, kid.>> It's not that you tuck under"
1270,01:21:33.75,01:21:36.79,someone's wing.It's you're smart enough to see
1271,01:21:36.79,01:21:39.08,why are they taking thesepeople out?
1272,01:21:39.08,01:21:42.38,The most aggressive female wasvoted out first.
1273,01:21:42.38,01:21:46.17,I saw that from day one.Betsy was gone second.
1274,01:21:46.17,01:21:48.29,Liz was gone.I was the last girl standing.
1275,01:21:48.29,01:21:51.08,"I killed a rat, for crying outloud."
1276,01:21:51.08,01:21:54.21,">> Not to interrupt, but you'redefinitely illuminating part of"
1277,01:21:54.21,01:21:57.33,your strategic thinking that Ithink some of us were hoping to
1278,01:21:57.33,01:21:59.17,see tonight.Thanks to all of you.
1279,01:21:59.17,01:22:01.88,"That was fun.>> PROBST: Thanks, John."
1280,01:22:01.88,01:22:07.17,"Erik, close it out.>> I'm going to try to keep"
1281,01:22:07.17,01:22:10.58,"this brief, but I don't needanything from any of you."
1282,01:22:10.58,01:22:15.04,"Mick, day one, they put aleadership necklace around your"
1283,01:22:15.04,01:22:19.42,neck.I go 39 days struggling to find
1284,01:22:19.42,01:22:23.33,a reason that you deserve thattitle.
1285,01:22:23.33,01:22:27.79,You did nothing.You did nothing with your team.
1286,01:22:27.79,01:22:29.79,You did nothing to encouragethem.
1287,01:22:29.79,01:22:33.04,Nobody on that team had anyguts.
1288,01:22:33.04,01:22:39.21,"You're responsible for that.Russell, this hurts me."
1289,01:22:39.21,01:22:45.67,"We have nothing in common.You played an unethical game,"
1290,01:22:45.67,01:22:48.17,admittedly played an unethicalgame.
1291,01:22:48.17,01:22:51.33,The crazy thing about it is isyou're sitting there and I'm
1292,01:22:51.33,01:22:54.04,standing here.Did you get to the right place
1293,01:22:54.04,01:22:56.88,by behaving the wrong way?I've never been in a situation
1294,01:22:56.88,01:23:00.04,"in my entire life where that hewas the case, but you sit there"
1295,01:23:00.04,01:23:05.21,"proud of it.Natalie, people will call you"
1296,01:23:05.21,01:23:07.50,weak.People will say that you are
1297,01:23:07.50,01:23:10.54,undeserving.But you know what?
1298,01:23:10.54,01:23:15.17,"Why are those characteristicsany less admirable as lying,"
1299,01:23:15.17,01:23:18.75,"cheating, and stealing?Why does he get a free pass,"
1300,01:23:18.75,01:23:22.58,but your wrong way of playingis admonished.
1301,01:23:22.58,01:23:24.96,If there's one thing that Ilearned in this game it is that
