2,00:00:07.62,00:00:07.62,"tonight, one of these five will win the title of sole survivor"
3,00:00:12.08,00:00:12.08,and the million dollars that comes with it.
4,00:00:14.29,00:00:14.29,There's only one thing standing in the way of the Foa Foa
5,00:00:17.58,00:00:17.58,"foursome making it all the way to the final four, and his name"
6,00:00:21.46,00:00:21.46,is Brett. But out of all the castaways
7,00:00:24.25,00:00:24.25,"that started this journey, how did it come down to these five?"
8,00:00:28.29,00:00:28.29,Russell had a strategy from the very beginning.
9,00:00:35.71,00:00:35.71,">> I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how"
10,00:00:39.25,00:00:39.25,"they think. >> PROBST: Because of Russell,"
11,00:00:41.50,00:00:41.50,the Foa Foa tribe turned on each other.
12,00:00:43.54,00:00:43.54,>> Somebody drank my whole canteen.
13,00:00:44.92,00:00:44.92,>> There's no more water. >> We gotta fill the canteens.
14,00:00:47.04,00:00:47.04,>> Would you just relax? >> Use a little common sense.
15,00:00:49.50,00:00:49.50,>> PROBST: The turmoil allowed Russell to manipulate his
16,00:00:52.12,00:00:52.12,tribe... >> She's going first.
17,00:00:53.83,00:00:53.83,>> PROBST: ...and take out anyone he wanted.
18,00:00:55.75,00:00:55.75,">> They my little puppets. When I'm finished with them, I"
19,00:00:58.46,00:00:58.46,just throw them in the trash. >> PROBST: Galu wins immunity!
20,00:01:01.71,00:01:01.71,But it also might have contributed to Foa Foa's
21,00:01:04.21,00:01:04.21,spectacular failure at challenges; they lost
22,00:01:07.92,00:01:07.92,almost every one. >> We do have a pox or a hex or
23,00:01:10.79,00:01:10.79,some kind of curse on Foa Foa. >> PROBST: But as their numbers
24,00:01:13.67,00:01:13.67,"rapidly dwindled, a tight-knit group of four emerged."
25,00:01:16.75,00:01:16.75,"Natalie, the quote, unquote nice girl."
26,00:01:19.33,00:01:19.33,"Most people didn't think she would last a day, let alone a"
27,00:01:22.38,00:01:22.38,a month. >> She came into this game the
28,00:01:24.50,00:01:24.50,Southern belle. I think she's changed a lot.
29,00:01:27.08,00:01:27.08,">> PROBST: Jaison, the social conscience of the tribe, a"
30,00:01:30.29,00:01:30.29,Fulbright scholar who stands up for what he believes in.
31,00:01:33.17,00:01:33.17,>> If what you're telling me is that what you said had
32,00:01:36.75,00:01:36.75,"absolutely no racial context, then maybe you are ignorant."
33,00:01:40.08,00:01:40.08,">> PROBST: Mick, who was initially selected as tribe"
34,00:01:42.25,00:01:42.25,leader but couldn't rally them to victory.
35,00:01:45.04,00:01:45.04,Mick with a great shot. Mick is the new mark to beat.
36,00:01:48.21,00:01:48.21,"However, lately he has proved that he can win individual"
37,00:01:51.46,00:01:51.46,challenges. Mick safe at tonight's Tribal
38,00:01:55.12,00:01:55.12,Council. This diverse group has one
39,00:01:57.04,00:01:57.04,thing in common; they all take their cues from Russell.
40,00:02:01.04,00:02:01.04,>> He is the most powerful player in this game.
41,00:02:07.25,00:02:07.25,(thunder crashing) >> PROBST: While the Foa Foa
42,00:02:11.33,00:02:11.33,"tribe struggled, the Galu tribe..."
43,00:02:14.46,00:02:14.46,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: sat back and laughed.
44,00:02:16.71,00:02:16.71,(all laughing) >> They are in trouble.
45,00:02:18.96,00:02:18.96,"After I'm finish this, I'll take the whole team"
46,00:02:21.04,00:02:21.04,by myself. >> Russell get off the table.
47,00:02:23.50,00:02:23.50,>> PROBST: But when they lost their charismatic leader...
48,00:02:26.17,00:02:26.17,Medical! to a medical emergency...
49,00:02:27.67,00:02:27.67,>> Lie him down. >> PROBST: ...they lost the glue
50,00:02:30.38,00:02:30.38,"that held them together. Unfortunately for them, they"
51,00:02:33.04,00:02:33.04,didn't realize it. Galu entered the merge with a
52,00:02:36.67,00:02:36.67,staggering 8-to-4 advantage... (cheers and applause)
53,00:02:42.21,00:02:42.21,>> PROBST: ...confident they would devour the opposition.
54,00:02:44.88,00:02:44.88,">> Unless something goes wrong, Foa Foa doesn't matter,"
55,00:02:47.21,00:02:47.21,simple as that. >> PROBST: But Natalie shocked
56,00:02:49.25,00:02:49.25,everyone by making the first counterattack.
57,00:02:50.71,00:02:50.71,>> (whispers) I don't trust Erik.
58,00:02:54.12,00:02:54.12,>> PROBST: She convinced the old Galu to take out one of
59,00:02:56.71,00:02:56.71,their strongest players. Time for you to go.
60,00:02:58.58,00:02:58.58,Then it was Russell's turn to make a move.
61,00:03:00.92,00:03:00.92,He scoured the camp and found a hidden immunity idol...
62,00:03:03.46,00:03:03.46,>> That easy. >> PROBST: ...and played it to
63,00:03:05.46,00:03:05.46,"take out another Galu. Kelly, the tribe has spoken."
64,00:03:08.33,00:03:08.33,He also turned a disgruntled Shambo against her tribe...
65,00:03:12.67,00:03:12.67,>> I trust Russell implicitly more than anybody in this game.
66,00:03:15.21,00:03:15.21,>> PROBST: ...which provided the old Foa Foa with the numbers to
67,00:03:18.21,00:03:18.21,take out four more of the old Galu in a row.
68,00:03:21.67,00:03:21.67,">> Stupid, stupid little girl. Bad strategy."
69,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,">> PROBST: By day 35, the Foa Foa turnaround was"
70,00:03:28.04,00:03:28.04,almost complete. >> It is done.
71,00:03:30.04,00:03:30.04,They say don't get confident in this game.
72,00:03:32.25,00:03:32.25,You know what? I'm confident as hell.
73,00:03:34.83,00:03:34.83,>> PROBST: But while Russell was congratulating himself on his
74,00:03:37.08,00:03:37.08,"clean sweep of the old Galu, Brett, who had been virtually"
75,00:03:40.75,00:03:40.75,"unheard of during the entire game, came out of nowhere to"
76,00:03:44.04,00:03:44.04,win challenges... Brett wins individual immunity!
77,00:03:47.54,00:03:47.54,...and keep the memory of Galu's past glories alive.
78,00:03:50.38,00:03:50.38,"Once again, Brett is safe at Tribal Council, guaranteed a"
79,00:03:53.79,00:03:53.79,spot in the final five. >> I worked too damn hard for
80,00:03:56.54,00:03:56.54,"some kid to come here and start working, and day 33-- you"
81,00:03:59.62,00:03:59.62,"know, what strategy did he do that worked for him?"
82,00:04:03.00,00:04:03.00,Absolutely nothing. >> PROBST: In order to beat
83,00:04:08.88,00:04:08.88,"Brett, the Foa Foa four decided they needed the youngest and"
84,00:04:12.08,00:04:12.08,"strongest players to stay in the game, so they were forced"
85,00:04:15.62,00:04:15.62,to vote off Shambo. With Brett's former tribe making
86,00:04:20.83,00:04:20.83,up the entire jury and Russell looming as a threat to his own
87,00:04:24.12,00:04:24.12,"allies, the real battle starts now."

90,00:06:09.88,00:06:09.88,Already. >> We don't have to get up.

95,00:06:26.71,00:06:26.71,I have so little energy and diarrhea all night.
96,00:06:28.96,00:06:28.96,"I was, like, ""Just don't let me get killed."""
97,00:06:32.54,00:06:32.54,">> Everybody here is sleeping, napping, complaining and"
98,00:06:37.04,00:06:37.04,"bitching, you know, I came here focused."
99,00:06:39.92,00:06:39.92,I came here knowing I was going to suffer.
100,00:06:43.17,00:06:43.17,But you know what? Get over it. Get up and do something.
101,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,Get ready for this challenge. We have to get rid of Brett.
102,00:06:51.25,00:06:51.25,It's a shame that I'm set up with these bunch of misfits
103,00:06:54.96,00:06:54.96,because I should be here with superstars.
104,00:06:57.29,00:06:57.29,>> I'm just ready to get out of here more than anything else.
105,00:07:00.04,00:07:00.04,My stomach hurts. Just try to get through two
106,00:07:02.21,00:07:02.21,"days and go home. >> Two more nights, man,"
107,00:07:04.88,00:07:04.88,that's it. >> Yeah.
108,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,">> Two more nights here. >> As far as I'm concerned,"
109,00:07:09.50,00:07:09.50,everything's cool. So I'm not second-guessing what
110,00:07:11.96,00:07:11.96,we got going on. If you know what I mean.
111,00:07:15.08,00:07:15.08,>> Yeah. I think Russell will have a hard
112,00:07:20.08,00:07:20.08,time voting her off. >> I think Russell will have an
113,00:07:23.29,00:07:23.29,easier time doing a lot of things than you think.
114,00:07:25.79,00:07:25.79,"None of us really have a chance as long as Brett's here, so we"
115,00:07:28.88,00:07:28.88,"got to keep going after him. >> Hopefully, one of us will"
116,00:07:31.79,00:07:31.79,pull this thing off. >> I agree.
117,00:07:35.29,00:07:35.29,Brett shouldn't be here right now.
118,00:07:36.96,00:07:36.96,"You know, this guy has got some skills."
119,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,I think he can make a run. And now this guy is going on an
120,00:07:42.42,00:07:42.42,immunity run like we've never seen.
121,00:07:44.12,00:07:44.12,(thunder rumbling) >> Look what's happening now.
122,00:07:50.21,00:07:50.21,>> I was worried. >> You know what's gonna
123,00:07:52.21,00:07:52.21,happen if he wins the next one? I ain't gonna be there
124,00:07:55.67,00:07:55.67,to save you. How?
125,00:08:00.21,00:08:00.21,">> But how would I be next, though?"
126,00:08:03.12,00:08:03.12,Why would I be next? >> Because the three guys state
127,00:08:06.29,00:08:06.29,to beat him on the last challenge.
128,00:08:10.33,00:08:10.33,>> Okay. So we got to just...
129,00:08:14.04,00:08:14.04,">> Well, that sucks. >> Well, we just got to win."
130,00:08:17.42,00:08:17.42,He's not some freakin' athlete genius.
131,00:08:20.33,00:08:20.33,">> Well, I would love to go to the final three and..."
132,00:08:24.62,00:08:24.62,">> Yeah, I know. We just have..."
133,00:08:26.54,00:08:26.54,I don't know what's gonna happen.
134,00:08:28.12,00:08:28.12,"We could possibly beat him, and then it's back to the"
135,00:08:30.92,00:08:30.92,"normal plan. >> If not, though, you think"
136,00:08:32.54,00:08:32.54,I'm going? >> Probably so.
137,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,">> You know, my whole goal coming into this game was to"
138,00:08:38.88,00:08:38.88,"play the underdog, be underestimated and just kind of"
139,00:08:42.29,00:08:42.29,"slide through, which is what I've done, and it's gotten me"
140,00:08:45.21,00:08:45.21,this far. >> We all know what has
141,00:08:47.08,00:08:47.08,to happen. Sometimes you got to go for it.
142,00:08:50.79,00:08:50.79,"That's what I'm gonna do. >> You know, Russell and I had"
143,00:08:54.29,00:08:54.29,"always planned to be in the top, but unfortunately, they"
144,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,want to beat Brett so bad at the next immunity challenge
145,00:09:00.83,00:09:00.83,"that, you know, there's honestly, probably no way that I"
146,00:09:05.25,00:09:05.25,could beat Brett. >> We just got to win this one.
147,00:09:13.42,00:09:13.42,">> Yeah. >> If we don't beat him, we"
148,00:09:16.04,00:09:16.04,"don't have a shot. I'm talking about, you know,"
149,00:09:19.21,00:09:19.21,the dog in the corner. It looks like we've got four of
150,00:09:22.25,00:09:22.25,"them in the corner now. You know, Brett's won two"
151,00:09:25.21,00:09:25.21,individual immunities. He could possibly win the last
152,00:09:28.17,00:09:28.17,"two, but what's two immunities? If Jaison could win two in a"
153,00:09:32.75,00:09:32.75,"row, anybody can win two in a row."
154,00:09:34.96,00:09:34.96,That means absolutely nothing to me.
155,00:09:37.83,00:09:37.83,Let's see if a 21-year-old can outdo me when it comes to pain.
156,00:09:41.71,00:09:41.71,So you're telling me he's all of a sudden superman 'cause he
157,00:09:45.42,00:09:45.42,"wins two? He, he's not some superstar"
158,00:09:47.96,00:09:47.96,"to me. You start thinking that, you"
159,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,"start getting weak in the mind, thinking you can't beat him,"
160,00:09:52.08,00:09:52.08,like you're stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson.
161,00:09:54.17,00:09:54.17,He's no Mike Tyson. He's Brett.
162,00:10:02.21,00:10:02.21,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Final five:"
163,00:10:13.04,00:10:13.04,"Natalie, Russell, Brett, wearing immunity..."
164,00:10:18.08,00:10:18.08,"Mick and Jaison. Russell, as we go into this"
165,00:10:23.21,00:10:23.21,"challenge, is it still the Foa Foa four against the one"
166,00:10:27.25,00:10:27.25,"remaining guy in purple? >> Yes, it is."
167,00:10:30.21,00:10:30.21,"That's what it is. >> PROBST: Brett, does that"
168,00:10:32.88,00:10:32.88,energize you or make you feel like you've got to watch your
169,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,back everywhere? >> This is an individual
170,00:10:37.62,00:10:37.62,"competition, so it's definitely a motivator to know that I have"
171,00:10:41.08,00:10:41.08,"four people with the sole goal of just beating me, so, yeah,"
172,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,it's definitely a motivator for me.
173,00:10:46.04,00:10:46.04,">> PROBST: Well, you've had it two times in a row around"
174,00:10:48.42,00:10:48.42,your neck. Let's see if you can do it a
175,00:10:50.71,00:10:50.71,"third time. I will take it back, Brett..."
176,00:10:57.21,00:10:57.21,"...because once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
177,00:11:01.75,00:11:01.75,"For today's challenge, you will race across a series of"
178,00:11:04.50,00:11:04.50,"obstacles, grab a bag of puzzle pieces, and race back."
179,00:11:08.25,00:11:08.25,You must then climb a very steep wall to a platform and
180,00:11:11.88,00:11:11.88,use those pieces to solve a puzzle.
181,00:11:14.25,00:11:14.25,First person to get it right wins immunity and is guaranteed
182,00:11:19.04,00:11:19.04,a one-in-four shot at winning a million bucks.
183,00:11:23.04,00:11:23.04,We know what's up; four Foa Foa taking on one former Galu.
184,00:11:26.92,00:11:26.92,Shall we get to it? >> Yes.
185,00:11:29.04,00:11:29.04,">> Let's do it. >> PROBST: We'll draw for spots,"
186,00:11:31.25,00:11:31.25,we'll get started. Here we go for immunity and a
187,00:11:36.38,00:11:36.38,guaranteed spot in the final four.
188,00:11:39.00,00:11:39.00,Survivors ready? Go!
189,00:11:48.25,00:11:48.25,Jaison takes a hard fall in the net run.
190,00:11:54.25,00:11:54.25,Mick falls off. Got to get back up on.
191,00:11:57.88,00:11:57.88,Natalie's across. Jaison is across.
192,00:12:00.62,00:12:00.62,Brett is across. And Mick is across.
193,00:12:03.67,00:12:03.67,Russell heading back. Jaison's heading back.
194,00:12:09.88,00:12:09.88,Everybody heading back. Russell cruising across the
195,00:12:13.71,00:12:13.71,balance beam. Russell scales that wall.
196,00:12:27.25,00:12:27.25,Jaison right behind. Brett's still in it.
197,00:12:34.25,00:12:34.25,Everybody climbing up the wall. Everybody is in this challenge.
198,00:12:41.21,00:12:41.21,Russell has his pieces open first.
199,00:12:43.38,00:12:43.38,Mick right behind. Brett now has his pieces untied.
200,00:12:48.12,00:12:48.12,Five people vying for a shot at the final four.
201,00:12:54.00,00:12:54.00,That much closer to a million bucks.
202,00:12:57.12,00:12:57.12,The stakes are very clear for Brett.
203,00:13:00.08,00:13:00.08,He has four people working to beat him.
204,00:13:07.12,00:13:07.12,Brett making quick work of his puzzle.
205,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,Mick now getting in on it. His puzzle starting to come
206,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,together. Russell starting to come
207,00:13:16.71,00:13:16.71,together. Natalie starting to come
208,00:13:19.29,00:13:19.29,together. Everybody needs to keep moving.
209,00:13:22.79,00:13:22.79,"Somebody going home tonight. Jaison, nowhere close at this"
210,00:13:28.04,00:13:28.04,point. 37 days is a long time to lose
211,00:13:32.12,00:13:32.12,now. Russell getting a little closer.
212,00:13:37.46,00:13:37.46,"Mick getting closer. Right now it is Brett, Russell,"
213,00:13:41.58,00:13:41.58,and Mick. You need to keep moving.
214,00:13:44.88,00:13:44.88,This challenge is going to end soon.
215,00:13:47.04,00:13:47.04,Russell trying to pick up the pace.
216,00:13:51.50,00:13:51.50,Brett very close. Brett with only a couple of
217,00:13:54.17,00:13:54.17,pieces left. Russell trying to scramble.
218,00:13:57.17,00:13:57.17,Mick hustling to finish. Brett has it!
219,00:14:05.17,00:14:05.17,Brett wins immunity! >> Yeah.
220,00:14:10.12,00:14:10.12,">> Oh, man. >> PROBST: Brett, come on over."
221,00:14:25.96,00:14:25.96,"For the third time in a row, Brett wins individual immunity."
222,00:14:30.88,00:14:30.88,"Odds clearly stacked against you, you continue to defy them."
223,00:14:34.92,00:14:34.92,Brett is safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
224,00:14:37.54,00:14:37.54,One of the original Foa Foa four going home after 37 days.
225,00:14:42.79,00:14:42.79,I don't envy this afternoon. It's going to be an interesting
226,00:14:45.04,00:14:45.04,one. Grab your stuff.
227,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
228,00:14:48.08,00:14:48.08,Congrats. >> Thanks.
229,00:14:49.79,00:14:49.79,If I didn't win immunity I know I was going home.
230,00:14:52.58,00:14:52.58,I've been trying for some time to get the Foa Foa tribe on the
231,00:14:56.08,00:14:56.08,"jury, and tonight, at Tribal will be the first time that"
232,00:14:58.54,00:14:58.54,that's happened. To finally see a Foa Foa member
233,00:15:02.83,00:15:02.83,go home will be relieving. >> It is absolutely the worst
234,00:15:23.08,00:15:23.08,feeling to have to go to Tribal Council tonight.
235,00:15:26.08,00:15:26.08,"All four of us Foa Foa have been so tight, loyal, and"
236,00:15:29.83,00:15:29.83,trustworthy to this point. We have no other Galu to
237,00:15:34.54,00:15:34.54,"pick off. I mean, Brett won immunity."
238,00:15:37.25,00:15:37.25,There is no other option. A Foa Foa has to go home and I
239,00:15:40.67,00:15:40.67,"definitely feel like my head's on the chopping block, clearly,"
240,00:15:43.54,00:15:43.54,because I'm the weakest one. I'm just... I'm hanging by
241,00:15:46.29,00:15:46.29,a thread. So what's the plan?
242,00:15:50.42,00:15:50.42,I'm sure they want me. >> Yeah...
243,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,I'm gonna change it. >> Promise me?
244,00:15:56.92,00:15:56.92,">> Yeah, I promise you. >> I've trusted you only from"
245,00:16:00.17,00:16:00.17,"the first day, so... >> If it was you, I'd tell you"
246,00:16:02.67,00:16:02.67,right now. >> I know.
247,00:16:04.00,00:16:04.00,"Just like I told you earlier, it might be."
248,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,>> I'm trying to keep Natalie because she's holding on my
249,00:16:07.50,00:16:07.50,coattails. Who better to take to the final
250,00:16:11.04,00:16:11.04,two than her? There's no way she can beat me
251,00:16:13.04,00:16:13.04,"in votes? 'Cause the next challenge, I"
252,00:16:16.04,00:16:16.04,"think I'll take the next one. He's a kid, so he's going to"
253,00:16:19.21,00:16:19.21,"give it all he's got, but you know what?"
254,00:16:22.54,00:16:22.54,All backs are up against the wall now.
255,00:16:25.08,00:16:25.08,">> This is the hard part, sitting here waiting for Tribal"
256,00:16:27.12,00:16:27.12,Council. Just going to go through the
257,00:16:30.38,00:16:30.38,motions and do what we can do tonight.
258,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,And move on to tomorrow. >> Yup.
259,00:16:38.92,00:16:38.92,You guys know what you're doing or up in the air?
260,00:16:42.71,00:16:42.71,">> You know, you always think you know what you're doing but"
261,00:16:45.25,00:16:45.25,"you never actually know what's going to happen, you know."
262,00:16:48.29,00:16:48.29,>> Yup. >> So...
263,00:16:50.29,00:16:50.29,">> Oh! >> What's going on, man?"
264,00:16:53.83,00:16:53.83,>> I'm tired. >> A couple of days left.
265,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,">> Jaison checked out of this game a long time ago, and the"
266,00:17:00.08,00:17:00.08,"weakest link right now is Jaison, even over Natalie."
267,00:17:03.71,00:17:03.71,She's stronger than him. So the question is now Mick or
268,00:17:07.96,00:17:07.96,Jaison? It's a good thing about keeping
269,00:17:10.25,00:17:10.25,Jaison is he can't beat me in the votes.
270,00:17:13.12,00:17:13.12,The bad thing about keeping Jaison is he can't beat Brett
271,00:17:16.33,00:17:16.33,in the challenge. The good thing about keeping
272,00:17:20.08,00:17:20.08,Mick is he can possibly beat Brett in the challenge.
273,00:17:24.29,00:17:24.29,The bad thing about keeping Mick is Mick might beat me in
274,00:17:28.08,00:17:28.08,jury votes. One of us is going home.
275,00:17:33.00,00:17:33.00,">> Yeah, well, I mean, yeah-- >> The only way me and you can"
276,00:17:35.67,00:17:35.67,stay in the final three is to keep Natalie.
277,00:17:38.79,00:17:38.79,We're gonna have to get rid of of Mick.
278,00:17:40.46,00:17:40.46,>> I agree. We'll get rid of Mick and then
279,00:17:42.21,00:17:42.21,take another shot at Brett. >> Right.
280,00:17:44.46,00:17:44.46,>> Yeah. Russell and I have a very long
281,00:17:46.79,00:17:46.79,"history of working together. From, I think, day two we"
282,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,decided we were going to have an alliance and go to the finals
283,00:17:51.71,00:17:51.71,together and I think it's just grown exponentially over
284,00:17:55.21,00:17:55.21,the last 37 days and I think Russell and I trust each other
285,00:17:58.08,00:17:58.08,"enough that we are comfortable. When I say this, I mean it."
286,00:18:01.71,00:18:01.71,"When he says that, he means it. And so I really do think it will"
287,00:18:05.25,00:18:05.25,be myself and Russell and somebody else in the finals on
288,00:18:07.79,00:18:07.79,day 39. >> This is how it's going to go.
289,00:18:12.04,00:18:12.04,"I mean, it's going to be Jaison leaves tonight."
290,00:18:14.96,00:18:14.96,That gives us a shot to beat Brett.
291,00:18:17.12,00:18:17.12,We cannot beat him for the million dollars.
292,00:18:19.12,00:18:19.12,Jaison can't beat him in anything.
293,00:18:22.08,00:18:22.08,>> The plan is that it be Jaison tonight.
294,00:18:24.96,00:18:24.96,"I wish he could stay around, but Natalie's head's much more"
295,00:18:28.50,00:18:28.50,"in the game than Jaison's. He shows up, but he's not"
296,00:18:32.38,00:18:32.38,really into it at all. >> If you agree with me on
297,00:18:36.12,00:18:36.12,"that, we're cool. >> I agree with you on that."
298,00:18:38.54,00:18:38.54,">> We'll go to the final three. I promise you, we're going to"
299,00:18:41.12,00:18:41.12,the final three. >> All right.
300,00:18:43.50,00:18:43.50,I like it. Russell and I had a pact from
301,00:18:45.79,00:18:45.79,the very beginning that it would be us in the final three.
302,00:18:49.25,00:18:49.25,And the fact that that's actually on the horizon is a
303,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,little shocking. >> All right.
304,00:18:55.12,00:18:55.12,">> Okay, done. >> I'm going to go look"
305,00:18:57.67,00:18:57.67,"this way. You know, I told Mick to vote"
306,00:19:00.04,00:19:00.04,"Jaison, Jaison to vote Mick. So you know, It's up to me and"
307,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,Natalie if Mick goes home or if Jaison goes home.
308,00:19:08.29,00:19:08.29,We're the ones making the decision.
309,00:19:12.50,00:19:12.50,"Well, let's discuss Mick or Jaison."
310,00:19:15.21,00:19:15.21,>> There are pros and cons to both.
311,00:19:17.12,00:19:17.12,>> So why do you think Jaison should go tonight?
312,00:19:19.46,00:19:19.46,>> He hasn't been feeling well the last couple of days.
313,00:19:22.21,00:19:22.21,He's had nothing to drink. >> Why should we vote off Mick?
314,00:19:25.54,00:19:25.54,">> Voting off Mick would ensure that he'd be gone tonight, then"
315,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,"tomorrow if we win immunity, then it's just me, you, and"
316,00:19:32.42,00:19:32.42,Jaison in the top three and we have a better chance.
317,00:19:35.17,00:19:35.17,>> I could keep Mick. I could keep Jaison.
318,00:19:40.00,00:19:40.00,They both have goods and bads. So now I'm weighing it.
319,00:19:45.25,00:19:45.25,What in the world am I supposed to do?
320,00:20:07.04,00:20:07.04,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
321,00:20:11.25,00:20:11.25,Erik. Kelly.
322,00:20:14.12,00:20:14.12,Laura. John.
323,00:20:16.50,00:20:16.50,Dave. Monica.
324,00:20:19.12,00:20:19.12,"And Shambo, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
325,00:20:25.79,00:20:25.79,"All right, well, after seven straight Tribal Councils in"
326,00:20:29.96,00:20:29.96,"which former Galu members were voted out, finally, it comes"
327,00:20:33.83,00:20:33.83,down to this-- one of the former Foa Foa members is going
328,00:20:36.96,00:20:36.96,"home tonight. Jaison, when did the reality"
329,00:20:40.62,00:20:40.62,really hit you that there was nowhere to hide?
330,00:20:44.54,00:20:44.54,">> Probably when I heard ""Brett wins immunity."""
331,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,"I mean, who thought he was going to win three in a row?"
332,00:20:50.71,00:20:50.71,"You know, I came into this challenge figuring it had to be"
333,00:20:53.08,00:20:53.08,one of our times to take that necklace back to move forward
334,00:20:55.29,00:20:55.29,"with the four of us. But clearly, that didn't happen."
335,00:20:58.42,00:20:58.42,">> PROBST: So, Natalie, it seems like there would be two very"
336,00:21:01.08,00:21:01.08,different approaches to tonight's vote.
337,00:21:03.50,00:21:03.50,">> Absolutely. I mean, if we don't beat Brett,"
338,00:21:06.67,00:21:06.67,"clearly, he's going to get every single vote on the jury."
339,00:21:09.33,00:21:09.33,So do we keep the strongest people that could possibly beat
340,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,"Brett? The other thought is, do I keep"
341,00:21:15.08,00:21:15.08,someone that I think I can beat in front of the jury?
342,00:21:18.79,00:21:18.79,">> PROBST: Jaison, I'm guessing the real dilemma is if I keep"
343,00:21:22.08,00:21:22.08,"the right people and we beat Brett, but I keep the wrong"
344,00:21:25.08,00:21:25.08,people because I can't beat the guys I kept.
345,00:21:27.21,00:21:27.21,>> Yeah. And I think it's especially
346,00:21:29.33,00:21:29.33,difficult because there are two or three people up here who
347,00:21:32.79,00:21:32.79,"could command a lot of the jury votes, so maybe it is better"
348,00:21:35.25,00:21:35.25,just to try and take out the next strongest competitor for
349,00:21:38.75,00:21:38.75,"the jury, and see if we can get lucky and get Brett next time."
350,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,">> PROBST: Mick, who would have guessed with only five people"
351,00:21:44.12,00:21:44.12,left there would be so many different layers of decision
352,00:21:47.58,00:21:47.58,making happening? >> My mindset has been Brett in
353,00:21:52.21,00:21:52.21,front of the jury equals a million bucks.
354,00:21:55.17,00:21:55.17,So it makes sense to keep people that can beat him at
355,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,this last immunity. >> PROBST: Your argument is all
356,00:22:02.25,00:22:02.25,"hands on deck, got to take out Brett."
357,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,>> Right. >> PROBST: Jaison says all
358,00:22:07.46,00:22:07.46,hands on deck could ultimately backfire because I still want
359,00:22:10.04,00:22:10.04,to win. Why would that make sense?
360,00:22:12.75,00:22:12.75,>> You're putting a lot more pressure on yourself in saying I
361,00:22:15.62,00:22:15.62,"think I can beat Brett. And so far, it just hasn't"
362,00:22:18.92,00:22:18.92,"happened, man. None of these old guys up here"
363,00:22:21.04,00:22:21.04,has been able to take the kid out.
364,00:22:22.79,00:22:22.79,">> PROBST: Brett, up until now, have you been sandbagging it"
365,00:22:25.42,00:22:25.42,waiting to turn on the afterburners?
366,00:22:28.08,00:22:28.08,>> I think the past few challenges have just coincided
367,00:22:30.75,00:22:30.75,with certain skills that I have and having really nothing to
368,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,lose is a different frame of mind that I have  that these
369,00:22:37.38,00:22:37.38,"people don't necessarily have. >> PROBST: Brett, what was it"
370,00:22:40.29,00:22:40.29,like for you at camp today? You got nothing to worry about.
371,00:22:43.75,00:22:43.75,These four had to be scrambling.
372,00:22:45.75,00:22:45.75,">> Yeah, but I think I'd rather have the stress that they have."
373,00:22:48.33,00:22:48.33,"I mean, you can't bank on winning immunity challenges"
374,00:22:51.58,00:22:51.58,"forever to stay in this game. Most of the time, you kind of"
375,00:22:54.50,00:22:54.50,"need that social component so when you don't win, you"
376,00:22:57.08,00:22:57.08,"know, someone has your back and they can take you to end."
377,00:23:00.00,00:23:00.00,">> PROBST: Russell, a little surprised that Brett would"
378,00:23:02.50,00:23:02.50,actually prefer to be where you guys are now?
379,00:23:06.25,00:23:06.25,">> Yeah, because how hard is it to beat Foa Foa, really, you"
380,00:23:10.67,00:23:10.67,know? We won one immunity challenge.
381,00:23:13.50,00:23:13.50,He wins three in a row... (laughter)
382,00:23:15.75,00:23:15.75,"You know, we're still getting beat by Galu, but only one of"
383,00:23:19.12,00:23:19.12,"them is here. >> PROBST: Jaison, would you"
384,00:23:22.88,00:23:22.88,gladly switch with Brett and take the necklace tonight?
385,00:23:25.04,00:23:25.04,>> Yeah. Who wouldn't want the odds that he has right now.
386,00:23:28.04,00:23:28.04,"He just has to win one more challenge, and there might be"
387,00:23:31.17,00:23:31.17,"two of us in the finals, but if he got there, he'd definitely"
388,00:23:34.29,00:23:34.29,have the upper hand. >> PROBST: The reason I'm
389,00:23:36.92,00:23:36.92,bringing it up is we're at the point in the game where how you
390,00:23:39.17,00:23:39.17,play the game is going to impact the jury.
391,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,"Brett, it's one thing to get to the end."
392,00:23:44.42,00:23:44.42,It's another to have earned the spot in the end.
393,00:23:46.83,00:23:46.83,">> Yeah, I've won three challenges in a row which is"
394,00:23:49.54,00:23:49.54,"great, but it don't mean anything unless I can win the"
395,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,next one. So you got to stay humble in
396,00:23:54.50,00:23:54.50,this game and not feel too strong in my own abilities to
397,00:23:58.08,00:23:58.08,"potentially screw that up. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
398,00:24:02.50,00:24:02.50,"to the vote. Brett, I got to tell you, when"
399,00:24:04.71,00:24:04.71,"Tribal Council started, I wasn't even going to bother"
400,00:24:07.00,00:24:07.00,"asking, but in light of your comments, is there somebody"
401,00:24:09.92,00:24:09.92,you want to give that necklace to so you can switch spots?
402,00:24:12.62,00:24:12.62,">> No, I'm going to keep it. >> PROBST: All right, you"
403,00:24:15.25,00:24:15.25,cannot vote for Brett. Everybody else is fair game.
404,00:24:17.62,00:24:17.62,"It's time to vote. Mick, you're up."
405,00:24:29.21,00:24:29.21,">> This sucks. I hate doing this, but I kind"
406,00:24:32.04,00:24:32.04,of feel like you checked out a long time ago.
407,00:24:34.38,00:24:34.38,"So... >> Sorry, buddy, this was a"
408,00:24:45.92,00:24:45.92,tough one. >> I hate that I have to do
409,00:24:59.62,00:24:59.62,"this, but I got to keep to my strategic play, and this is"
410,00:25:03.75,00:25:03.75,the best move for me to win the game.
411,00:25:13.79,00:25:13.79,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
412,00:25:27.58,00:25:27.58,Once the votes are read the decision is final.
413,00:25:30.17,00:25:30.17,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
414,00:25:32.46,00:25:32.46,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
415,00:25:37.88,00:25:37.88,"First vote, Mick. Jaison."
416,00:25:48.25,00:25:48.25,"One vote Mick, one vote Jaison. Jaison."
417,00:25:54.71,00:25:54.71,"Two votes Jaison, one vote Mick. 14th person voted out and the"
418,00:26:04.21,00:26:04.21,"eighth member of our jury, Jaison."
419,00:26:07.21,00:26:07.21,There's three. That's enough.
420,00:26:08.83,00:26:08.83,"You need to bring me your torch. Jaison, the tribe has spoken."
421,00:26:35.17,00:26:35.17,Congratulations on making it to the final four.
422,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,Tomorrow you will compete in your final immunity challenge.
423,00:26:42.12,00:26:42.12,Try to get a good night's sleep. Grab your torches.
424,00:26:45.04,00:26:45.04,Head back to camp. Good night.
425,00:26:54.33,00:26:54.33,>> I'm kind of pissed off at Russell for blindsiding me.
426,00:26:58.83,00:26:58.83,For a relationship that you had since day two you at least let
427,00:27:01.79,00:27:01.79,the guy know he's going home. So I don't think I'd be
428,00:27:04.21,00:27:04.21,cheering for Russell in this one.
429,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,I would root for Brett. Brett is the underdog.
430,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,He is who we were. We came from nothing to be
431,00:27:10.46,00:27:10.46,something and he did pretty much the same thing on his own
432,00:27:13.25,00:27:13.25,"to win three straight, maybe four straight."
433,00:27:29.17,00:27:29.17,">> Final four. >> Thank you, Lord."
434,00:27:34.42,00:27:34.42,>> So few torches. It's weird.
435,00:27:36.75,00:27:36.75,>> Yes. >> It's definitely a miracle
436,00:27:40.12,00:27:40.12,"for me to still be here as day 37 ends, and there are three"
437,00:27:46.17,00:27:46.17,Foa Foas in the final four. >> Yes. Congratulations.
438,00:27:49.62,00:27:49.62,">> Good work, bro. >> Final four."
439,00:27:51.83,00:27:51.83,>> Final four. >> Final Foa.
440,00:27:53.38,00:27:53.38,>> This is something I didn't really imagine.
441,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,"As I look towards the next Tribal Council, you know, I"
442,00:27:59.79,00:27:59.79,really feel like my fate is in my own hands.
443,00:28:02.83,00:28:02.83,"As of right now, the only thing I'm banking on is really"
444,00:28:06.04,00:28:06.04,winning another immunity challenge because if I don't
445,00:28:09.67,00:28:09.67,win I'm probably going to be the next person to go home.
446,00:28:21.12,00:28:21.12,>> Me and you is in the top three.
447,00:28:24.17,00:28:24.17,Do you think you can beat me? >> What?
448,00:28:26.71,00:28:26.71,">> If you win the last immunity idol, me and you is in the top"
449,00:28:29.33,00:28:29.33,"three, do you think you can beat me?"
450,00:28:31.58,00:28:31.58,>> I don't know. >> Do you think it would be a
451,00:28:33.75,00:28:33.75,shot? >> It would be a...
452,00:28:35.17,00:28:35.17,I think it would be pretty close.
453,00:28:38.08,00:28:38.08,>> Brett won immunity. That means he could possibly
454,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,win four immunity challenges in a row.
455,00:28:44.12,00:28:44.12,"That's a humungous threat. Of the people that's here, if I"
456,00:28:48.33,00:28:48.33,"went to the final three, and I got to choose, dude, I'm here"
457,00:28:53.29,00:28:53.29,who deserves it more. Trust me.
458,00:28:55.17,00:28:55.17,>> Yeah. >> I'm here to win the game.
459,00:28:57.08,00:28:57.08,They should have three at the top that deserve it the most.
460,00:29:00.25,00:29:00.25,>> I'd rather go up against someone that's harder to beat
461,00:29:02.75,00:29:02.75,"and lose than to, like, put myself in a position where I go"
462,00:29:06.12,00:29:06.12,up against people that are easier to beat and win.
463,00:29:08.88,00:29:08.88,>> What I can promise you is me and you will be in the top
464,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,"three. Have a seat, man."
465,00:29:15.50,00:29:15.50,">> Yeah. >> So if you win it, then"
466,00:29:19.75,00:29:19.75,"you're safe, of course. If I win it I'll take you to"
467,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,"top three. If we win top three, we have no"
468,00:29:24.54,00:29:24.54,doubts. I'm going to do it straight up
469,00:29:26.92,00:29:26.92,with you. Deal.
470,00:29:30.71,00:29:30.71,>> Deal. >> Top three.
471,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,>> Legitimate. >> I'm real on this.
472,00:29:34.25,00:29:34.25,">> I'm real, too. >> Okay."
473,00:29:35.54,00:29:35.54,>> This is a big one. >> You got to have some kind of
474,00:29:38.25,00:29:38.25,"insurance policy in this game. If he keeps winning, I got to"
475,00:29:41.21,00:29:41.21,"save myself. Number one, uno, here."
476,00:29:44.21,00:29:44.21,I take care of me. I don't take care of nobody
477,00:29:46.79,00:29:46.79,else this game. So I'm sitting pretty right now.
478,00:29:50.17,00:29:50.17,I have a one-two spot with every single person out here
479,00:29:53.25,00:29:53.25,"right now, Natalie, Brett, and Mick."
480,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,It looks like I'm going to be in the top three no matter what.
481,00:29:59.67,00:29:59.67,">> Ooh, it's a big one. >> If I win this challenge"
482,00:30:03.71,00:30:03.71,"today, I'm 100% positive that the game is mine."
483,00:30:07.29,00:30:07.29,"I won the million dollars. You know, it's a very"
484,00:30:09.92,00:30:09.92,"interesting situation to be in, but I love it."
485,00:30:12.54,00:30:12.54,This is how I want it to be. >> Tree mail!
486,00:30:15.83,00:30:15.83,Got a little note for you all. All right.
487,00:30:20.38,00:30:20.38,"""Congratulations, final four. You are almost at the end of"
488,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,the line. Follow the map to the cliffs on
489,00:30:28.92,00:30:28.92,the coast. There you will find the torches
490,00:30:31.75,00:30:31.75,"of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect"
491,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,a representative mask of those who were voted out before you.
492,00:30:39.96,00:30:39.96,"At the end of your journey, you will burn them, paying your"
493,00:30:42.88,00:30:42.88,respects as they each had a part in getting you to this
494,00:30:47.00,00:30:47.00,point. You will then proceed to your
495,00:30:49.58,00:30:49.58,"final immunity challenge."" Each person that has been voted"
496,00:30:56.00,00:30:56.00,out has played some role in how I got where I am right now.
497,00:30:59.92,00:30:59.92,"I mean, you know, every Tribal Council I look at the jury, and"
498,00:31:02.29,00:31:02.29,"I see all the people that I trusted, and so, you know, I'm"
499,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,really fighting for them. I'm fighting for the Galu tribe
500,00:31:09.50,00:31:09.50,that flourished in the first half of this game and
501,00:31:11.75,00:31:11.75,floundered in the second half. So it's definitely the
502,00:31:14.12,00:31:14.12,"motivation for me to keep pushing, to keep fighting, and"
503,00:31:16.62,00:31:16.62,let the purple win. >> Marisa.
504,00:31:20.17,00:31:20.17,>> Marisa! >> Marisa!
505,00:31:21.83,00:31:21.83,>> I really believe if I wouldn't have got rid of her
506,00:31:24.92,00:31:24.92,"first, I wouldn't be here today. >> The men in my tribe really"
507,00:31:28.96,00:31:28.96,came gunning for me. They were really scared of
508,00:31:31.96,00:31:31.96,having any strong women on their tribe and I was the
509,00:31:34.50,00:31:34.50,"strongest woman on our tribe, period."
510,00:31:37.12,00:31:37.12,And so I learned a great deal about myself.
511,00:31:39.46,00:31:39.46,Being a strong woman is way more important than getting any
512,00:31:42.33,00:31:42.33,kind of validation from a man. >> Mike Borassi.
513,00:31:49.54,00:31:49.54,>> Wow. >> This is one of the most
514,00:31:51.46,00:31:51.46,headstrong competitors I think on Foa Foa.
515,00:31:54.17,00:31:54.17,"He wasn't going to hear ""no."" >> You know, he didn't even get"
516,00:31:56.62,00:31:56.62,to play the game. That's what sad about that.
517,00:31:58.88,00:31:58.88,>> Yeah. >> I underestimated the
518,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,conditions and how severe it can get.
519,00:32:05.88,00:32:05.88,It's a thousand times harder than I thought it would be.
520,00:32:09.58,00:32:09.58,"But I not only held my own. I made them respect me, and"
521,00:32:12.79,00:32:12.79,"that's the whole thing. You never give up, and you go"
522,00:32:15.38,00:32:15.38,"down swinging. >> Oh, Betsy."
523,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,">> The only thing that I didn't like is she told me was,"
524,00:32:27.04,00:32:27.04,"""Russell, you're playing this game too hard."""
525,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,"You know what? If you only play it 50%, even"
526,00:32:32.67,00:32:32.67,"starting at day one, this is where you end up."
527,00:32:36.00,00:32:36.00,>> I think being here rekindled the desire to push myself to
528,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,the limits that I lost before I had kids.
529,00:32:47.21,00:32:47.21,"So now I tapped into that, and I feel like a breath of fresh"
530,00:32:51.96,00:32:51.96,air. >> Ben.
531,00:32:57.67,00:32:57.67,">> Oh, Ben. >> I think he had no idea how"
532,00:33:00.04,00:33:00.04,to play it socially. >> Right.
533,00:33:02.42,00:33:02.42,>> None. >> I wasn't sorry to see him go.
534,00:33:05.12,00:33:05.12,>> I think I'm a little misinterpreted.
535,00:33:07.38,00:33:07.38,I was very brutally honest with everybody.
536,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,People can't handle that. They don't want to hear about
537,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,themselves. They don't want to hear the
538,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,truth because the truth hurts. I'm truthful with myself.
539,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,I know myself. And if the survival aspect of
540,00:33:18.21,00:33:18.21,"this game was just survival, I would kill all these people."
541,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,"Our girl, Yas! >> Yasmin!"
542,00:33:26.00,00:33:26.00,">> That girl is just such a-- such a  character, such a"
543,00:33:28.75,00:33:28.75,"crack-up. >> At the end of the day, the"
544,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,girl from the 'hood did do pretty good.
545,00:33:34.42,00:33:34.42,I learned to keep trusting myself.
546,00:33:36.46,00:33:36.46,That is something I will continue to do and I also
547,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,"learned one other thing, I won't be going camping."
548,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,(laughing) >> Ashley.
549,00:33:45.21,00:33:45.21,>> She was my little sister. I loved her.
550,00:33:47.75,00:33:47.75,">> My strategy was to make a really strong alliance, and it"
551,00:33:52.92,00:33:52.92,didn't work. I got played.
552,00:33:55.50,00:33:55.50,"Russell made an alliance with every single person, and he's a"
553,00:33:59.29,00:33:59.29,snake. And he called the shots.
554,00:34:01.96,00:34:01.96,"If he wanted you out, you were out."
555,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,">> Big Russ, the heart and soul to the Galu tribe."
556,00:34:09.12,00:34:09.12,You guys don't know. This is the man that propelled
557,00:34:12.08,00:34:12.08,us to so many victories. >> Tenacious.
558,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,That guy was tenacious in challenges.
559,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,"I mean, we hated to see him go, but stoked to see him go as"
560,00:34:20.42,00:34:20.42,well. >> Being taken out of the game
561,00:34:23.33,00:34:23.33,for medical reasons is the most demoralizing thing I've ever
562,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,felt. I believe a man is supposed to
563,00:34:29.92,00:34:29.92,provide for his family. I was going to win that million
564,00:34:33.08,00:34:33.08,dollars. But for my wife and my
565,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,"daughter, knowing that they're there waiting on me to come"
566,00:34:38.38,00:34:38.38,"home, if it wasn't for them, I would have rather died that day."
567,00:34:45.67,00:34:45.67,>> Liz. >> She was physical.
568,00:34:48.17,00:34:48.17,Let me tell you. >> She was.
569,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,">> She was a rock star, for sure."
570,00:34:52.21,00:34:52.21,>> I would never have characterized myself as
571,00:34:54.33,00:34:54.33,somebody who was patient before. And now I have known the
572,00:34:58.42,00:34:58.42,"depths of patience. You know, when you go without"
573,00:35:02.04,00:35:02.04,food and you go without a lot of the creature comforts that
574,00:35:05.29,00:35:05.29,"you're used to, you have nothing but patience."
575,00:35:10.75,00:35:10.75,>> Erik. All the big moves we made in
576,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,"this game, Foa Foa, Galu made the first big move for us."
577,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,">> Fierce competitor. >> Fierce, fierce competitor."
578,00:35:19.96,00:35:19.96,>> He was. >> Almost psycho?
579,00:35:22.79,00:35:22.79,"(all laugh) >> I experienced betrayal, but"
580,00:35:26.58,00:35:26.58,the most perfect thing happened; I was betrayed so that I could
581,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,leave indicators for that betrayal.
582,00:35:32.29,00:35:32.29,Voting me out was the downfall of Galu.
583,00:35:34.71,00:35:34.71,And so I am completely content with how things ended up.
584,00:35:40.92,00:35:40.92,">> Oh, Kelly! >> Kel dawg, my homegirl."
585,00:35:44.46,00:35:44.46,">> The funny thing is, in this game, I feel like the men are"
586,00:35:48.04,00:35:48.04,"always terrified of the women, which totally makes sense now,"
587,00:35:50.42,00:35:50.42,so I got sent home. Definitely had a lot of fight
588,00:35:53.04,00:35:53.04,left in me for the game. I could have done it.
589,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,>> Little Laura. >> Such a strong competitor.
590,00:36:03.21,00:36:03.21,">> I was clearly, like, one of the oldest people that was"
591,00:36:06.54,00:36:06.54,out there. You know what?
592,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,"You still can't beat me. I mean, even at my age, even"
593,00:36:11.04,00:36:11.04,"being a grandma, I'm totally re-stereotyping the grandma."
594,00:36:13.83,00:36:13.83,You can't beat this grandma. >> There's John.
595,00:36:20.12,00:36:20.12,"He tried to make a move with me, along with me and Shambo."
596,00:36:23.62,00:36:23.62,"For some reason, he thought I was telling him the truth."
597,00:36:27.79,00:36:27.79,>> Being part of a highly effective team is something
598,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,that I'm used to. But your ability to connect
599,00:36:32.75,00:36:32.75,with idiots who can't process things properly is a large part
600,00:36:36.88,00:36:36.88,of what this comes down to. It's like you only have so much
601,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,control over the way people do things.
602,00:36:41.96,00:36:41.96,But I don't think I had a better move than what I did.
603,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,>> Danger Dave Ball. >> Danger Dave.
604,00:36:50.71,00:36:50.71,>> Danger Dave Ball. >> What a man.
605,00:36:53.71,00:36:53.71,>> Hilarious. >> I'm not really the easiest
606,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,person to grasp. I'm not the easiest person to
607,00:36:59.58,00:36:59.58,get along with. I can be a jerk...
608,00:37:01.71,00:37:01.71,but I can also be fairly warm and compassionate.
609,00:37:04.54,00:37:04.54,"I would like to be, you know, appreciated and accepted for"
610,00:37:07.50,00:37:07.50,"who I am, but I've kind of learned to be okay with being"
611,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,misunderstood. >> Monica!
612,00:37:18.54,00:37:18.54,">> You know, I got to be honest with you guys, I think Monica"
613,00:37:21.92,00:37:21.92,was the fakest person here. >> Well...
614,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,>> I think she wanted to go out...
615,00:37:25.92,00:37:25.92,>> ...with a bang. >> a fight.
616,00:37:27.12,00:37:27.12,">> With a bang, yeah. >> And that girl is"
617,00:37:29.04,00:37:29.04,a firecracker. >> She was a firecracker.
618,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,>> I give that girl much credit. >> You gear up for these
619,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,"challenges. I mean, I look around me and I"
620,00:37:36.38,00:37:36.38,see a lot of these really well- apt competitors and that fear of
621,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,failure is so dark and it's scary.
622,00:37:42.46,00:37:42.46,"And then you come to a point where you're, like,"
623,00:37:45.08,00:37:45.08,"""You know what? ""I'm gonna do this for myself,"
624,00:37:47.04,00:37:47.04,"""and I'm gonna put it all out there."""
625,00:37:49.38,00:37:49.38,And that is in itself is winning a million dollars.
626,00:37:54.96,00:37:54.96,>> Shambo! >> Shambo!
627,00:37:56.92,00:37:56.92,>> You guys give this girl much prop.
628,00:37:59.29,00:37:59.29,>> Definitely. >> Without her you guys would
629,00:38:01.29,00:38:01.29,not be standing here. >> We would not be here if it
630,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,weren't for Shambo. >> That is for darn sure.
631,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,">> I was alienated, shunned, disrespected, and the funny"
632,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,"thing is, in my entire life, I have been the uplifter of the"
633,00:38:15.54,00:38:15.54,the underdog. So to be the one that was the
634,00:38:18.17,00:38:18.17,victim was just a bizarre eye-opening experience.
635,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,It doesn't hurt my self-esteem. It makes me incredibly proud
636,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,and happy that God made me the person that I am.
637,00:38:31.25,00:38:31.25,Lift people up... don't tear 'em down.
638,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,>> The last fallen survivor... >> ALL: Jaison.
639,00:38:41.08,00:38:41.08,">> Jaison-- a great competitor, super smart guy."
640,00:38:44.29,00:38:44.29,"I mean the guy is, uh... we'll be voting for senator for him"
641,00:38:47.54,00:38:47.54,"before we know it, I think. >> Oh, yeah."
642,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,">> I was having a really, really, really, really, really"
643,00:38:53.25,00:38:53.25,difficult time. But I am really proud of myself
644,00:38:55.96,00:38:55.96,"for not quitting, and so I think that I take away from this a"
645,00:38:59.42,00:38:59.42,"new confidence in myself to be able to get through difficult,"
646,00:39:02.21,00:39:02.21,hard times because I've been so miserable.
647,00:39:04.17,00:39:04.17,(groans) >> An ode to our fallen
648,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,survivors. >> We pay our respects.
649,00:39:19.83,00:39:19.83,We wouldn't be here without you. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
650,00:40:10.21,00:40:10.21,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your"
651,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,final immunity challenge? >> Yes.
652,00:40:19.62,00:40:19.62,>> Let's do it. >> I guess so.
653,00:40:21.25,00:40:21.25,">> PROBST: I'll take it back once again, Brett."
654,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
655,00:40:34.25,00:40:34.25,Today's challenge will require balance and concentration.
656,00:40:38.79,00:40:38.79,"Here's how it works: on my ""go,"" you will each place a"
657,00:40:42.75,00:40:42.75,wooden statue on the end of a pole.
658,00:40:44.71,00:40:44.71,"At regular intervals, you'll add another section of pole,"
659,00:40:48.46,00:40:48.46,making it more difficult to keep stable.
660,00:40:51.00,00:40:51.00,"The statue falls off, you're out of the challenge."
661,00:40:54.04,00:40:54.04,Last person left standing wins immunity and is guaranteed a
662,00:40:57.88,00:40:57.88,spot at the final Tribal Council where you will get a
663,00:41:01.08,00:41:01.08,chance to plead your case in front of the jury for
664,00:41:04.17,00:41:04.17,a million dollars. Very simple.
665,00:41:06.92,00:41:06.92,Shall we get to it? >> Yes.
666,00:41:09.25,00:41:09.25,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: Take your spots.
667,00:41:11.67,00:41:11.67,"We'll get started. All right, everybody take your"
668,00:41:18.42,00:41:18.42,"statue, place it on your first section of pole."
669,00:41:21.88,00:41:21.88,"Make sure you like where it's at, and then you'll have to"
670,00:41:26.58,00:41:26.58,"take your hand off the statue, and we'll be started."
671,00:41:30.46,00:41:30.46,"All right, five, four, three, two, one."
672,00:41:35.25,00:41:35.25,This challenge is on. (Russell exhales sharply)
673,00:41:42.00,00:41:42.00,"All right, you have 30 seconds to add another section of pole"
674,00:41:46.17,00:41:46.17,starting now. You got to reach for that
675,00:41:51.12,00:41:51.12,"section of pole, get it in the slot, get your hands back down"
676,00:41:56.46,00:41:56.46,"on that lowest section. That little white marker,"
677,00:42:02.50,00:42:02.50,that's your boundary. You don't want to go above that.
678,00:42:06.67,00:42:06.67,"If your statue falls off, you're out of the challenge."
679,00:42:10.33,00:42:10.33,We will keep adding another section of pole every two
680,00:42:16.00,00:42:16.00,minutes until only one player is left.
681,00:42:40.92,00:42:40.92,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Don't panic.
682,00:43:00.00,00:43:00.00,Don't rush. You have plenty of time.
683,00:43:06.62,00:43:06.62,Mick is the first one out of the challenge.
684,00:43:13.38,00:43:13.38,Natalie's now out of the challenge.
685,00:43:16.96,00:43:16.96,We're down to two. Russell and Brett.
686,00:43:22.67,00:43:22.67,Each of you are now holding six feet.
687,00:43:25.21,00:43:25.21,"One former Foa Foa, one former Galu."
688,00:43:30.25,00:43:30.25,There are no secrets out here. Brett needs to win to move to
689,00:43:36.25,00:43:36.25,that final Tribal Council. Russell would love to take him
690,00:43:40.25,00:43:40.25,out and go to final Tribal with Mick and Natalie and have a
691,00:43:44.58,00:43:44.58,shot at winning. This is quite possibly the
692,00:43:49.25,00:43:49.25,million-dollar challenge. The wind's starting
693,00:44:02.17,00:44:02.17,to pick up a little bit now. Affecting both guys.
694,00:44:13.25,00:44:13.25,Good recovery. Here we go.
695,00:44:20.00,00:44:20.00,It is time to add another section of pole.
696,00:44:23.21,00:44:23.21,This will put you at seven feet. This is when it gets
697,00:44:26.08,00:44:26.08,really tricky. Take your time.
698,00:44:28.96,00:44:28.96,You have 30 seconds to make the transition.
699,00:44:31.88,00:44:31.88,It starts now. Brett quickly goes for his.
700,00:44:45.12,00:44:45.12,Russell waiting. Got ten seconds left.
701,00:45:01.79,00:45:01.79,"Five, four, three,"
702,00:45:08.04,00:45:08.04,"two, one. Another successful transition."
703,00:45:17.25,00:45:17.25,You're now at seven feet. Brett starting to wobble.
704,00:45:45.88,00:45:45.88,Nice recovery. This is a showdown.
705,00:46:03.08,00:46:03.08,Russell starting to wobble. Brett falls off.
706,00:46:26.38,00:46:26.38,"Russell wins individual immunity, his first and it"
707,00:46:29.96,00:46:29.96,couldn't have come at a better time.
708,00:46:34.92,00:46:34.92,">> Good job, Brett. >> PROBST: Russell, come on"
709,00:46:48.17,00:46:48.17,over. >> This is the time I wanted it.
710,00:46:55.33,00:46:55.33,>> PROBST: Russell wins the final individual immunity
711,00:46:59.12,00:46:59.12,challenge. You're going to the final
712,00:47:01.17,00:47:01.17,Tribal Council. You will get a chance to plead
713,00:47:03.29,00:47:03.29,your case in front of the jury as to why you deserve a million
714,00:47:06.12,00:47:06.12,"dollars. Natalie, Mick, Brett, one of"
715,00:47:10.17,00:47:10.17,you going home tonight. Your shot at a million dollars
716,00:47:13.00,00:47:13.00,will come to an end. Grab your stuff.
717,00:47:14.92,00:47:14.92,Head back to camp. See you at Tribal tonight.
718,00:47:18.79,00:47:18.79,>> I won immunity today. This is worth a million dollars
719,00:47:22.08,00:47:22.08,"right now. In my opinion, I just won the"
720,00:47:24.54,00:47:24.54,game. >> Great job.
721,00:47:51.08,00:47:51.08,"It was awesome. Phenomenal, Russ."
722,00:47:52.88,00:47:52.88,">> Finally got it around your neck, my friend."
723,00:47:55.75,00:47:55.75,">> Finally got it. Congrats, man."
724,00:47:58.08,00:47:58.08,">> So final immunity challenge, it was our last-ditch effort to"
725,00:48:01.25,00:48:01.25,"beat Brett, and Russell and Brett came down to just a"
726,00:48:03.79,00:48:03.79,"nail-biter. It was just... I mean, watching"
727,00:48:08.04,00:48:08.04,these things back and forth. And you're just like Russell is
728,00:48:11.21,00:48:11.21,"shaking, Brett looks focused. Now Brett's swinging."
729,00:48:14.29,00:48:14.29,"I mean, it was really, really intense."
730,00:48:16.62,00:48:16.62,And once Brett's fell it was just this... (sighs)
731,00:48:19.08,00:48:19.08,this sigh of relief. >> How you doing?
732,00:48:21.88,00:48:21.88,>> I'm doing great. Really good.
733,00:48:24.17,00:48:24.17,"I mean, really your fate is out of your own hands at this point."
734,00:48:28.58,00:48:28.58,"Whether you won or lost that challenge, whether someone goes"
735,00:48:32.29,00:48:32.29,"home tonight or makes it till-- till the end, I'm"
736,00:48:36.25,00:48:36.25,definitely proud-- I really am proud to make it
737,00:48:38.50,00:48:38.50,"this far, so... >> Well, you should be."
738,00:48:41.08,00:48:41.08,You had a pretty amazing streak there.
739,00:48:45.08,00:48:45.08,">> It's definitely-- definitely been an awesome experience,"
740,00:48:48.12,00:48:48.12,"for sure. I'm like a little girl, all"
741,00:48:51.00,00:48:51.00,emotional. >> Well deserved.
742,00:48:55.12,00:48:55.12,>> Yeah. I failed.
743,00:48:59.96,00:48:59.96,"Because I was unable to win the immunity challenge today, I'm"
744,00:49:03.04,00:49:03.04,pretty certain that I'll be going home tonight.
745,00:49:06.29,00:49:06.29,The only thing I have to fall back on is Russell's deal that
746,00:49:10.25,00:49:10.25,"he made with me that if one of us were to win, we would take"
747,00:49:14.12,00:49:14.12,the other person to the finals. >> So what do you all think of
748,00:49:20.96,00:49:20.96,my chances of winning a million dollars now?
749,00:49:23.33,00:49:23.33,">> I think that you're going to win, hands down."
750,00:49:25.29,00:49:25.29,">> Because now that I took out Brett, and I played the game."
751,00:49:28.21,00:49:28.21,>> I think hands down you'll win.
752,00:49:30.04,00:49:30.04,">> I think I've got a good shot now, man."
753,00:49:32.12,00:49:32.12,">> You've got a great shot. >> I do, too."
754,00:49:34.75,00:49:34.75,>> So what do you think Galu is going to say when they see me
755,00:49:38.17,00:49:38.17,"walk in with that? >> I think they're going to be,"
756,00:49:40.04,00:49:40.04,"like, ticked in a way, but then..."
757,00:49:42.38,00:49:42.38,>> I think they're going to say it's fitting.
758,00:49:44.58,00:49:44.58,"You know, I've played it strategically the whole time,"
759,00:49:46.92,00:49:46.92,and then at the very end when the biggest threat that I had to
760,00:49:49.58,00:49:49.58,"me to win the money, I had to beat, and I did."
761,00:49:55.04,00:49:55.04,"So, you know, it's going to be part of my speech now."
762,00:49:58.17,00:49:58.17,>> Yeah. >> Throw me the coconut over
763,00:50:01.00,00:50:01.00,"there, would you? >> I wish I was like him when I"
764,00:50:05.21,00:50:05.21,was his age. You know what I mean?
765,00:50:07.62,00:50:07.62,He's the kind of guy that I want my daughters to meet one
766,00:50:10.21,00:50:10.21,"day. You know, really."
767,00:50:12.17,00:50:12.17,">> Yes, you would. He will be a fantastic husband"
768,00:50:14.42,00:50:14.42,and father. He's just a great kid.
769,00:50:18.00,00:50:18.00,">> I made a promise to Brett, telling him that me, Brett, and"
770,00:50:22.42,00:50:22.42,Natalie will go to the final three.
771,00:50:25.46,00:50:25.46,"But, you see, I made a promise to Mick, too."
772,00:50:28.42,00:50:28.42,"So either way I slice it, if I break my promise with somebody,"
773,00:50:33.21,00:50:33.21,"I'll be putting them on the jury, they'll taking it"
774,00:50:35.12,00:50:35.12,personal-- that hates me. This is where the game gets
775,00:50:39.33,00:50:39.33,"tough. >> What's going on, guys?"
776,00:50:45.21,00:50:45.21,>> What? >> There some funny business
777,00:50:48.12,00:50:48.12,going on? >> Uh-uh. What do you mean?
778,00:50:51.21,00:50:51.21,">> I don't know, I've never seen Russell want to go get"
779,00:50:53.08,00:50:53.08,"wood. Maybe I'm just, I'm kind of a"
780,00:50:55.08,00:50:55.08,"skeptic, I guess. I just don't really-- I don't"
781,00:50:58.08,00:50:58.08,"know. >> No matter what, we get to be"
782,00:51:00.46,00:51:00.46,clean tomorrow. >> At some point.
783,00:51:02.75,00:51:02.75,>> And eat. Eat and be clean.
784,00:51:04.54,00:51:04.54,>> I almost want to cry. >> I know.
785,00:51:08.88,00:51:08.88,">> See? What's going on? >> Mick, you're fine."
786,00:51:11.17,00:51:11.17,Do not-- you're the most paranoid person.
787,00:51:13.58,00:51:13.58,>> I've never seen Russell go get firewood ever in 39 days.
788,00:51:17.54,00:51:17.54,>> Mick. Yeah?
789,00:51:19.12,00:51:19.12,You are so paranoid. Have I let you down yet?
790,00:51:22.62,00:51:22.62,Have I? >> Everybody's talking about me.
791,00:51:24.88,00:51:24.88,>> Are you on drugs? Do you honestly think any of us
792,00:51:26.67,00:51:26.67,want to go against him on the jury?
793,00:51:28.46,00:51:28.46,"No! >> I wouldn't think so, but"
794,00:51:30.12,00:51:30.12,Russ has all these little strange plans and ploys.
795,00:51:33.29,00:51:33.29,">> No, no, Mick. It's done."
796,00:51:35.96,00:51:35.96,"It's a done deal. >> Good, man."
797,00:51:37.21,00:51:37.21,">> You're coming back here tonight, and so am I, and so is"
798,00:51:40.17,00:51:40.17,Russell. It's the three of us.
799,00:51:42.83,00:51:42.83,We're coming back here. >> You know that I made a deal
800,00:51:49.62,00:51:49.62,with you. The problem I'm weighing in my
801,00:51:53.29,00:51:53.29,mind is I made a deal with everybody.
802,00:51:56.50,00:51:56.50,And you're the kind of guy I want my kids to marry.
803,00:52:00.04,00:52:00.04,You're the kind of guy I want my daughters-- I wish I was
804,00:52:02.96,00:52:02.96,like you when I was your age. And I ain't just saying that.
805,00:52:05.67,00:52:05.67,>> And I appreciate that. >> So the only option we have is
806,00:52:10.25,00:52:10.25,"Natalie is going to vote you, and Mick is going to vote you."
807,00:52:17.88,00:52:17.88,If I vote Mick... >> And I vote Mick.
808,00:52:21.12,00:52:21.12,">> ...and you vote Mick, then it's a 2-2 tie."
809,00:52:23.88,00:52:23.88,">> Yeah. >> And then it's a challenge, it"
810,00:52:26.04,00:52:26.04,might be a fire challenge. Do you think you could beat
811,00:52:28.33,00:52:28.33,Mick in a fire challenge? It's like you still have
812,00:52:30.67,00:52:30.67,another challenge. You're still working your way
813,00:52:33.08,00:52:33.08,to the end? >> Yeah.
814,00:52:40.12,00:52:40.12,>> Russell and I have talked over agreements for each other
815,00:52:45.38,00:52:45.38,previously in this game. It's hard to take his word 100%
816,00:52:49.00,00:52:49.00,and know that he's going to stick behind it.
817,00:52:51.88,00:52:51.88,"All I can really do right now is hope that he's, you know, a"
818,00:52:54.58,00:52:54.58,"man of his word, and will fall back on his actions."
819,00:53:02.17,00:53:02.17,>> I've been wearing a necklace-for a long time in
820,00:53:04.12,00:53:04.12,this game. The hidden immunity idol.
821,00:53:06.42,00:53:06.42,And I finally get the real deal. Definitely better late than
822,00:53:10.17,00:53:10.17,"never, because look where it came."
823,00:53:12.38,00:53:12.38,It came on the last one. The one that puts me in front
824,00:53:15.21,00:53:15.21,"of the jury to win this game. Right now, you have to worry"
825,00:53:24.88,00:53:24.88,about jury votes. And that's all I'm thinking
826,00:53:27.96,00:53:27.96,about right now. How can I get more jury votes?
827,00:53:31.58,00:53:31.58,Brett's a real good guy. I like Brett a lot.
828,00:53:35.92,00:53:35.92,"Mick, he's a good guy, too. But I'm playing a game."
829,00:53:39.38,00:53:39.38,I'm still strongly considering keeping Brett.
830,00:53:43.54,00:53:43.54,May the best man win. Everybody would be shocked if I
831,00:53:47.04,00:53:47.04,did that. But you know what?
832,00:53:48.96,00:53:48.96,I think that might get me jury votes-- keeping the strongest
833,00:53:52.04,00:53:52.04,here. My head's spinning now.
834,00:53:54.71,00:53:54.71,It gets tougher and tougher. Every time you think it can't
835,00:53:57.83,00:53:57.83,"get any tougher than this, but now I'm damned if I do and I'm"
836,00:54:01.21,00:54:01.21,damned if I don't. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
837,00:54:26.21,00:54:26.21,the members of our jury. Erik.
838,00:54:31.38,00:54:31.38,Kelly. Laura.
839,00:54:34.38,00:54:34.38,John. Dave.
840,00:54:37.08,00:54:37.08,Monica. Shambo.
841,00:54:40.58,00:54:40.58,"And Jaison, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
842,00:54:48.25,00:54:48.25,"So let's talk about today, your final immunity challenge."
843,00:54:52.71,00:54:52.71,"Mick, you're out first, Natalie right behind."
844,00:54:56.04,00:54:56.04,Leaves us with the showdown. Russell and Brett.
845,00:55:00.00,00:55:00.00,"Russell, this had to be how you wanted it to go down, going up"
846,00:55:03.62,00:55:03.62,against a guy who's been a very strong competitor in this game.
847,00:55:08.21,00:55:08.21,>> Definitely. I knew he would be the one that
848,00:55:11.25,00:55:11.25,"would be there with me at the end, and I thought, I lose, I"
849,00:55:14.38,00:55:14.38,go home. I came to win.
850,00:55:16.96,00:55:16.96,I didn't come to even come second.
851,00:55:19.12,00:55:19.12,So I put more effort into this challenge than I have into
852,00:55:22.46,00:55:22.46,"anything in this entire game. >> PROBST: Brett, did you figure"
853,00:55:26.33,00:55:26.33,it would be Russell that might be the one to give you a run
854,00:55:29.04,00:55:29.04,"for your money? >> Oh, yeah, I mean without"
855,00:55:30.96,00:55:30.96,a doubt. He's got the mentality that is
856,00:55:33.21,00:55:33.21,"""I have to win."" and that's the mindset I've"
857,00:55:35.17,00:55:35.17,been having the past few immunity challenges.
858,00:55:37.88,00:55:37.88,">> PROBST: Mick, the minute Brett goes out of this challenge"
859,00:55:40.08,00:55:40.08,"and he's vulnerable, did you know that's it, he's going home?"
860,00:55:43.04,00:55:43.04,">> Yeah, absolutely, right away. You know what I mean."
861,00:55:45.96,00:55:45.96,"He's been such a competitor, but it was a huge relief."
862,00:55:49.42,00:55:49.42,">> PROBST: Natalie, no doubt in your mind?"
863,00:55:51.71,00:55:51.71,Easy decision? >> Yes. Absolutely.
864,00:55:55.33,00:55:55.33,">> PROBST: Now, Russell, is there a part of you that can"
865,00:55:57.58,00:55:57.58,appreciate the competitor in Brett?
866,00:56:00.17,00:56:00.17,The guy has lasted a long time with the odds against him.
867,00:56:03.29,00:56:03.29,>> Right. He played a great game.
868,00:56:06.21,00:56:06.21,"And it's because I respect the game so much, he deserves to be"
869,00:56:09.17,00:56:09.17,"sitting up there with me. I mean, you know, we're"
870,00:56:13.33,00:56:13.33,probably the two best up here. And you want the best with you
871,00:56:17.12,00:56:17.12,"to talk in front of jury. You know, that's just how it"
872,00:56:19.88,00:56:19.88,"should be. >> PROBST: Mick, surprised by"
873,00:56:22.79,00:56:22.79,Russell's comment about maybe it's fair to take Brett to the
874,00:56:26.88,00:56:26.88,end because he's earned it more than somebody else up here?
875,00:56:30.33,00:56:30.33,">> Yeah, I think he makes a pretty good case."
876,00:56:32.75,00:56:32.75,"I mean, it's not one I would agree with per se."
877,00:56:36.29,00:56:36.29,I would tend to think the opposite.
878,00:56:39.62,00:56:39.62,"You know, Brett going in front of that jury, none of us have a"
879,00:56:42.08,00:56:42.08,"chance at a million bucks. >> PROBST: Natalie, a little"
880,00:56:45.17,00:56:45.17,"surprised? >> No, actually, I'm not"
881,00:56:47.83,00:56:47.83,"surprised. Because, again, Brett has been"
882,00:56:51.00,00:56:51.00,an outstanding competitor. But Russell knows
883,00:56:55.21,00:56:55.21,"strategically, it's not a good move at all to take Brett and"
884,00:56:59.25,00:56:59.25,"put Brett in front of the jury. >> PROBST: Brett, do you sense a"
885,00:57:02.46,00:57:02.46,little bit of worry from Natalie and Mick?
886,00:57:05.21,00:57:05.21,"I'm even hearing it, Natalie, right now, almost like she's"
887,00:57:07.46,00:57:07.46,"talking to Russell saying, ""You know that's not a good move,"
888,00:57:10.08,00:57:10.08,"right?"" >> Well, I mean, if Russ truly"
889,00:57:13.17,00:57:13.17,"felt that he wanted to go up against the best, you know,"
890,00:57:16.42,00:57:16.42,they've got to be a little worried.
891,00:57:19.17,00:57:19.17,">> PROBST: If Russell made a vote to keep you in the game, do"
892,00:57:22.21,00:57:22.21,you think Russell then earns respect from the jury?
893,00:57:26.17,00:57:26.17,">> Oh, yeah. Most definitely."
894,00:57:27.83,00:57:27.83,"I mean, by that action, you're showing a sense of confidence"
895,00:57:30.92,00:57:30.92,"within yourself and shows quite a bit of character to say, hey,"
896,00:57:34.38,00:57:34.38,"you might beat me at this, but I'm going to put you up against"
897,00:57:37.71,00:57:37.71,me and we'll put it to the test. >> PROBST: So based on what I'm
898,00:57:43.38,00:57:43.38,"hearing you guys say, what at one point was an absolute"
899,00:57:46.54,00:57:46.54,"certainty, Brett going home, now has a bit of suspense."
900,00:57:50.58,00:57:50.58,We'll see how it plays out. Russell has the individual
901,00:57:53.75,00:57:53.75,immunity necklace. I know you're not giving it up.
902,00:57:56.21,00:57:56.21,You cannot vote for Russell. Everybody else is fair game.
903,00:58:00.08,00:58:00.08,"Mick, you're up. >> Hell of a competitor, man."
904,00:58:13.25,00:58:13.25,Props to you. I got nothing but love for you.
905,00:58:28.62,00:58:28.62,">> (whispers): Brett, I'm voting for you because we have no shot"
906,00:58:32.46,00:58:32.46,at beating you at the final. >> PROBST: Russell.
907,00:58:57.79,00:58:57.79,"I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
908,00:59:14.08,00:59:14.08,decision is final. The person voted out will be
909,00:59:16.62,00:59:16.62,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
910,00:59:18.88,00:59:18.88,I'll read the votes. First vote...
911,00:59:25.50,00:59:25.50,Brett. Mick.
912,00:59:33.79,00:59:33.79,"One vote Mick, one vote Brett. Brett."
913,00:59:44.12,00:59:44.12,"Two votes Brett, one vote Mick. One vote left."
914,00:59:54.08,00:59:54.08,15th person voted out and the ninth and final member of our
915,00:59:57.21,00:59:57.21,"jury, Brett. You need to bring me your torch."
916,01:00:07.83,01:00:07.83,"Brett, the tribe has spoken. >> Great game, guys."
917,01:00:14.46,01:00:14.46,">> Bye, Brett. >> Thanks for the adventure."
918,01:00:23.38,01:00:23.38,">> PROBST: Well, you have gone a far as you can go in this game."
919,01:00:27.67,01:00:27.67,Tomorrow you will get a chance to plead your case to the jury
920,01:00:31.62,01:00:31.62,about why you deserve the million dollars and the title
921,01:00:34.92,01:00:34.92,of sole survivor. You have one more night in
922,01:00:37.46,01:00:37.46,in Samoa. Hope you can enjoy it.
923,01:00:39.42,01:00:39.42,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
924,01:00:41.67,01:00:41.67,"Good night. >> I knew, you know, a couple"
925,01:00:57.50,01:00:57.50,of Tribals ago that it was my time to go.
926,01:01:00.00,01:01:00.00,"And you know, I'm the last Galu member, which I'm so proud of"
927,01:01:02.79,01:01:02.79,"that, you know. To get to where I got, 38 days,"
928,01:01:06.17,01:01:06.17,one of the final four. It was definitely a testament
929,01:01:09.00,01:01:09.00,"to my will and hard work, and kind of felt like I went out on"
930,01:01:12.21,01:01:12.21,my own accord to some degree. >> I can't wait to brush and
931,01:01:44.12,01:01:44.12,floss my teeth. >> No more bamboo.
932,01:01:46.75,01:01:46.75,>> Let's go check tree mail. >> I'm ready.
933,01:01:52.38,01:01:52.38,">> Me, too. Oh, my word."
934,01:01:56.29,01:01:56.29,">> Strawberries? >> Oh, my goodness."
935,01:01:58.58,01:01:58.58,Pancake mix. >> Sausage and onions.
936,01:02:04.00,01:02:04.00,Civilization. Oh!
937,01:02:09.75,01:02:09.75,">> Sausage. Oh, my goodness. Grab that one end."
938,01:02:15.33,01:02:15.33,(cork pops) >> Yay! We're here on day 39.
939,01:02:18.71,01:02:18.71,">> Yes, indeed. I think we need a toast."
940,01:02:21.75,01:02:21.75,"Final three. >> Final three, Foa Foa."
941,01:02:24.71,01:02:24.71,>> From the get-go. >> May the best man win.
942,01:02:27.17,01:02:27.17,"You know, I said from day one I was gonna get here,"
943,01:02:31.12,01:02:31.12,and here I am. >> Wow. Very good.
944,01:02:33.08,01:02:33.08,"Isn't that great? >> Not only did I get here,"
945,01:02:37.04,01:02:37.04,I brought two people here that I wanted to be here with me.
946,01:02:44.54,01:02:44.54,They're gonna say I took you the whole way.
947,01:02:47.08,01:02:47.08,They're gonna say you couldn't have made it without
948,01:02:49.54,01:02:49.54,Russell. What you gonna say?
949,01:02:52.25,01:02:52.25,>> It's in God's hand at this point.
950,01:02:54.25,01:02:54.25,"If I'm not meant to win, that's fine."
951,01:02:56.33,01:02:56.33,I'm happy I made it to the third.
952,01:02:58.04,01:02:58.04,">> You see, you haven't been thinking about your speech too"
953,01:03:00.29,01:03:00.29,"much, then. >> Russell, no, I... "
954,01:03:08.29,01:03:08.29,All of them questions. >> Guess what.
955,01:03:10.17,01:03:10.17,Look who I aligned with from the first day.
956,01:03:12.29,01:03:12.29,">> Oh, you, so you saying you set up the alliance."
957,01:03:15.38,01:03:15.38,>> No. Okay. >> So what did do you
958,01:03:19.25,01:03:19.25,"strategically in this game? If you want second place, you"
959,01:03:22.50,01:03:22.50,have to do better than that. >> What about Mick?
960,01:03:27.17,01:03:27.17,"He was the nice guy, you know. >> Well, don't think I'm going"
961,01:03:31.17,01:03:31.17,"to eat up on that, too. I'm just saying, here behind me"
962,01:03:34.21,01:03:34.21,I have sitting the nice guy and the nice girl.
963,01:03:37.25,01:03:37.25,Have they outwitted me? Have they outplayed me?
964,01:03:42.08,01:03:42.08,"If they have, then give them the money because"
965,01:03:45.04,01:03:45.04,"they deserve it, so... >> Russell has good points,"
966,01:03:49.08,01:03:49.08,but he needs to be reminded that he couldn't have done this
967,01:03:52.17,01:03:52.17,"without us. I was a trustworthy,"
968,01:03:55.58,01:03:55.58,"hardworking, likable guy, and I got to the same place"
969,01:03:59.04,01:03:59.04,ultimately that Russell did. We just took totally different
970,01:04:01.58,01:04:01.58,"paths to do it. So, you know, some people may"
971,01:04:04.17,01:04:04.17,"say, ""Well, I liked your path a ""little better."
972,01:04:06.04,01:04:06.04,"Here's my vote."" >> Ease up..."
973,01:04:20.46,01:04:20.46,please. I think there may be a little
974,01:04:24.08,01:04:24.08,bit of strategy involved to Russell making us feel like
975,01:04:26.62,01:04:26.62,"we're not gonna win or that we don't have a chance, but I"
976,01:04:29.71,01:04:29.71,"have news for him. I'm not gonna give up, and I'll"
977,01:04:33.29,01:04:33.29,"just explain to the jury, I don't work the same way as"
978,01:04:36.08,01:04:36.08,Russell. That would clearly not have
979,01:04:37.79,01:04:37.79,"worked for me. The girls that were aggressive,"
980,01:04:39.83,01:04:39.83,"they got eliminated early. My strategy was to be myself,"
981,01:04:43.75,01:04:43.75,"and at the end of the day, you know, I wasn't out to get"
982,01:04:47.21,01:04:47.21,anybody or make anybody look look bad.
983,01:04:48.83,01:04:48.83,Russell made it clear he was okay with making people
984,01:04:51.33,01:04:51.33,look bad. (chuckles)
985,01:05:19.21,01:05:19.21,>> I never want to sleep on bamboo ever again.
986,01:05:21.58,01:05:21.58,">> Hell, no. I'm not gonna be rained on"
987,01:05:24.50,01:05:24.50,"ever again. >> Me, either!"
988,01:05:26.08,01:05:26.08,>> I'm not sleeping in the cold ever again.
989,01:05:29.08,01:05:29.08,Toss it up. This is the best fire we've
990,01:05:40.92,01:05:40.92,"had yet. >> Burn, baby, burn."
991,01:05:45.00,01:05:45.00,>> Whoo! >> If Mick or Natalie won this
992,01:05:49.17,01:05:49.17,"game over me, that would just be a shame."
993,01:05:53.25,01:05:53.25,"You know, it wouldn't make any sense to me."
994,01:05:56.04,01:05:56.04,I played this game strategically better than
995,01:05:58.46,01:05:58.46,"anybody, maybe in history. I really think this jury's"
996,01:06:03.75,01:06:03.75,gonna put my name down. I've accomplished the
997,01:06:06.71,01:06:06.71,impossible out here all by myself and brought
998,01:06:09.88,01:06:09.88,a couple of bums with me. I feel strong.
999,01:06:13.92,01:06:13.92,I feel good. I feel like I'm gonna go
1000,01:06:16.17,01:06:16.17,"into this, make a great speech, and take it."
1001,01:06:44.50,01:06:44.50,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury:
1002,01:06:49.12,01:06:49.12,Erik. Kelly.
1003,01:06:51.38,01:06:51.38,Laura. John.
1004,01:06:54.17,01:06:54.17,Dave. Monica.
1005,01:06:56.17,01:06:56.17,"Shambo. Jaison and Brett, voted out at"
1006,01:07:00.88,01:07:00.88,"the last Tribal Council. Well, congratulations on making"
1007,01:07:08.17,01:07:08.17,"it to the final three. Tonight, the power in this game"
1008,01:07:13.25,01:07:13.25,shifts to the jury. Nine people that you had a hand
1009,01:07:17.54,01:07:17.54,in voting out now control your fate in their hands.
1010,01:07:21.08,01:07:21.08,Very unique situation this season in that all three of you
1011,01:07:25.25,01:07:25.25,voted for every single person on the jury.
1012,01:07:28.38,01:07:28.38,So nobody has anywhere to hide. You will each get an opening
1013,01:07:33.96,01:07:33.96,statement. This is your chance to convince
1014,01:07:36.08,01:07:36.08,them why you deserve it. The jury will then get a chance
1015,01:07:39.83,01:07:39.83,to address you. They're gonna be trying to
1016,01:07:41.92,01:07:41.92,gather information to help them decide who they think is most
1017,01:07:44.67,01:07:44.67,worthy of the title of sole survivor and the million-dollar
1018,01:07:48.08,01:07:48.08,check that goes along with it. Then we will vote.
1019,01:07:51.71,01:07:51.71,Everybody ready to get to it? >> Yeah.
1020,01:07:55.83,01:07:55.83,">> PROBST: Opening statements. Mick, you're up."
1021,01:07:59.75,01:07:59.75,">> All right. Uh, good evening, everyone."
1022,01:08:02.38,01:08:02.38,"You know, I came into this game realizing that under the stress"
1023,01:08:06.46,01:08:06.46,of this whole process that there would be a lot of
1024,01:08:09.88,01:08:09.88,pressure to sort of give yourself a little more moral
1025,01:08:13.75,01:08:13.75,sort of leeway than maybe I was willing to give.
1026,01:08:18.38,01:08:18.38,"As underdogs coming in, I think that temptation is especially"
1027,01:08:22.17,01:08:22.17,strong to do whatever it takes to keep your head above water.
1028,01:08:26.29,01:08:26.29,I just played my whole game within sort of these parameters
1029,01:08:30.21,01:08:30.21,I really wasn't that willing to go outside of.
1030,01:08:33.79,01:08:33.79,I made it a point not to promise too much.
1031,01:08:36.58,01:08:36.58,"Not to overtly stomp on, lie or mislead people or to treat them"
1032,01:08:40.17,01:08:40.17,like sort of pawns in this game. The fact that I was able to get
1033,01:08:44.25,01:08:44.25,"this far by doing that, you know, that was kind of my"
1034,01:08:47.62,01:08:47.62,"goal in this, and I feel like I accomplished it."
1035,01:08:54.29,01:08:54.29,">> PROBST: Natalie, your opening statement."
1036,01:08:56.92,01:08:56.92,">> You know, I came into this game with a lot of people"
1037,01:09:00.21,01:09:00.21,"telling me before I ever came, ""What are you doing?"
1038,01:09:03.25,01:09:03.25,"""You're crazy. You can't do it."""
1039,01:09:06.08,01:09:06.08,"And I knew I would wake up every single day, if I didn't come do"
1040,01:09:10.38,01:09:10.38,"this, I would have regrets. And for me, it was definitely"
1041,01:09:13.50,01:09:13.50,"about wanting to, um, just gain the confidence to go outside my"
1042,01:09:18.29,01:09:18.29,comfort zone. This is the hardest thing I've
1043,01:09:20.83,01:09:20.83,"ever done mentally, physically, emotionally."
1044,01:09:24.21,01:09:24.21,This experience has been very humbling for me.
1045,01:09:26.50,01:09:26.50,"And without each and every one of you, I would not be sitting"
1046,01:09:29.92,01:09:29.92,sitting here. I appreciate it.
1047,01:09:31.79,01:09:31.79,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Russell, your opening"
1048,01:09:36.21,01:09:36.21,statement. >> Mine's going to be a little
1049,01:09:39.17,01:09:39.17,bit different than these two. I came here to do what I said I
1050,01:09:42.46,01:09:42.46,was going to do and try to make if all the way to the top and
1051,01:09:45.17,01:09:45.17,win the game. I made huge strategic moves all
1052,01:09:48.08,01:09:48.08,the way through the game. My first strategic moves were
1053,01:09:51.08,01:09:51.08,in my own tribe. Marisa and Betsy.
1054,01:09:54.58,01:09:54.58,"Those were the two that said ""Get rid of Russell."
1055,01:09:56.54,01:09:56.54,"Get rid of Russell."" Guess who goes first?"
1056,01:09:58.79,01:09:58.79,"Marisa and Betsy. When we go to Galu, I have"
1057,01:10:02.33,01:10:02.33,these guys right here behind me while I'm getting shot at.
1058,01:10:06.92,01:10:06.92,I solidified myself with Shambo to get rid of Kelly.
1059,01:10:11.25,01:10:11.25,It was a huge move. It didn't change the game yet.
1060,01:10:14.88,01:10:14.88,Laura was the biggest move I think of the game.
1061,01:10:17.46,01:10:17.46,"I had to go to John and say, ""John, if you help switch your"
1062,01:10:21.00,01:10:21.00,"vote, I'll vote off a Foa Foa member."""
1063,01:10:24.21,01:10:24.21,So he agrees. He switches his vote at the end.
1064,01:10:27.54,01:10:27.54,Laura goes home. Then John comes to me after
1065,01:10:29.96,01:10:29.96,"it's over, ""We've got to get rid of a Foa Foa."""
1066,01:10:32.08,01:10:32.08,"Well, I can't do that, so I have to get rid of John."
1067,01:10:35.12,01:10:35.12,Then it just went like dominoes from there.
1068,01:10:37.92,01:10:37.92,"The huge move was the most difficult, trying to get rid of"
1069,01:10:41.08,01:10:41.08,Brett. He won three immunity idols in
1070,01:10:43.08,01:10:43.08,a row. So I have to win physically to
1071,01:10:46.54,01:10:46.54,"get rid of Brett. Now, I ask you, if either one"
1072,01:10:51.08,01:10:51.08,"of these outwit me, then give them the money."
1073,01:10:54.54,01:10:54.54,"If either one of these out-played me, then give them"
1074,01:10:57.58,01:10:57.58,the game. But you know what?
1075,01:11:00.12,01:11:00.12,I don't think that they have. The truth is where it lies.
1076,01:11:04.04,01:11:04.04,"It's y'all's big decision to make tonight, and may the best"
1077,01:11:07.25,01:11:07.25,"man win. >> PROBST: All right, three very"
1078,01:11:11.33,01:11:11.33,"different opening statements. Jury, in a moment, you're going"
1079,01:11:15.04,01:11:15.04,"to get your first chance to address Mick, Natalie, and"
1080,01:11:18.79,01:11:18.79,Russell. I'll give you minute to think
1081,01:11:20.92,01:11:20.92,"about what you want to ask them. >> PROBST: All right, jury."
1082,01:11:36.04,01:11:36.04,"You've heard the opening statements from Mick, Natalie,"
1083,01:11:38.54,01:11:38.54,and Russell. It's now your first chance to
1084,01:11:40.88,01:11:40.88,address them. You're trying to gather
1085,01:11:43.25,01:11:43.25,information to help you make a million-dollar decision.
1086,01:11:46.29,01:11:46.29,Let's get started. Jaison.
1087,01:11:49.58,01:11:49.58,"You're up first. >> Well, congratulations."
1088,01:11:57.92,01:11:57.92,I'm going to give you guys an opportunity to look at the jury
1089,01:12:01.88,01:12:01.88,"and give them some information about who you really are, and"
1090,01:12:06.04,01:12:06.04,"if you don't, I will. >> I'll start."
1091,01:12:09.38,01:12:09.38,>> Go ahead. >> I was in pharmaceutical
1092,01:12:11.46,01:12:11.46,"sales before I came. I gave up my job, so"
1093,01:12:14.54,01:12:14.54,"technically, I am unemployed at this time but that is my dream"
1094,01:12:18.79,01:12:18.79,job. I want to find one when I go
1095,01:12:20.79,01:12:20.79,back home. >> Russell?
1096,01:12:23.08,01:12:23.08,>> I'm a businessman. I opened a business five years
1097,01:12:26.67,01:12:26.67,"ago, struggled for three years, just became successful with the"
1098,01:12:30.12,01:12:30.12,business for two years. This is the first business that
1099,01:12:33.54,01:12:33.54,I have succeeded with. That's what I do.
1100,01:12:36.25,01:12:36.25,>> Mick? >> I finished medical school.
1101,01:12:39.00,01:12:39.00,I'm 320 odd grand in debt from that.
1102,01:12:43.71,01:12:43.71,And it's going to take me a long time to pull out of debt.
1103,01:12:46.29,01:12:46.29,"I'm almost 35, and that's me. >> I don't think any of them"
1104,01:12:50.29,01:12:50.29,"have lied. But Natalie, you know, neglects"
1105,01:12:53.25,01:12:53.25,to tell you that she has made a lot of money.
1106,01:12:56.25,01:12:56.25,"Russell, probably the wealthiest guy on this panel,"
1107,01:12:59.04,01:12:59.04,"seven figures in the last year or so, he says."
1108,01:13:01.92,01:13:01.92,"You know, Mick, doctors do get paid very well, especially when"
1109,01:13:05.12,01:13:05.12,you get fellowships at one of the most prestigious hospitals
1110,01:13:07.62,01:13:07.62,"in America. So whatever decision is made,"
1111,01:13:11.08,01:13:11.08,no one is broke. I think you guys should look to
1112,01:13:14.04,01:13:14.04,other criteria. That's all I have to say.
1113,01:13:16.42,01:13:16.42,">> PROBST: Thanks, Jaison. Shambo, you're up."
1114,01:13:22.25,01:13:22.25,">> Hi, guys. I would just like to apologize"
1115,01:13:26.54,01:13:26.54,to America for dismantling Galu because I'm really questioning
1116,01:13:31.50,01:13:31.50,that judgment call at this point.
1117,01:13:33.92,01:13:33.92,"Mick, wow. Dude, you have got to be"
1118,01:13:38.25,01:13:38.25,"kidding me. In a word, would you agree that"
1119,01:13:42.04,01:13:42.04,your overall game playing could be called...
1120,01:13:45.79,01:13:45.79,>> Here it comes. >> ...feckless.
1121,01:13:48.12,01:13:48.12,>> Feckless? >> I would have to look up
1122,01:13:51.62,01:13:51.62,feckless. I don't know what feckless is.
1123,01:13:53.67,01:13:53.67,">> Well, I think that's a really good idea after this is over."
1124,01:13:56.25,01:13:56.25,"I'm done with you. >> Okay, will do, Shambo."
1125,01:13:59.00,01:13:59.00,>> Natalie the word that just is resonating in my mind that
1126,01:14:02.54,01:14:02.54,"starts with a ""C."" Can you finish it?"
1127,01:14:06.17,01:14:06.17,"I'm going to let you finish it, Sham."
1128,01:14:08.17,01:14:08.17,>> Coattail. How do you think America is
1129,01:14:12.21,01:14:12.21,going to perceive you sitting up there in the final three?
1130,01:14:15.17,01:14:15.17,"Give it to me, Natalie. >> I think America is going to"
1131,01:14:17.17,01:14:17.17,say she came the most ill-equipped in a sundress and
1132,01:14:21.12,01:14:21.12,gold wedges. She should have been voted out
1133,01:14:24.12,01:14:24.12,"first. And you know what, I had enough"
1134,01:14:26.12,01:14:26.12,"intuition to notice that girl that goes out aggressive,"
1135,01:14:30.17,01:14:30.17,"target, gone. Marisa and Betsy."
1136,01:14:33.38,01:14:33.38,That's not smart. >> I'm calling just major B.S.
1137,01:14:36.29,01:14:36.29,on your sentence that you just hit me with.
1138,01:14:38.83,01:14:38.83,"I'm, like, cracking up inside like you have no idea."
1139,01:14:40.88,01:14:40.88,>> Okay. >> The jig is up.
1140,01:14:43.62,01:14:43.62,"Natalie, Mick, no way in God's green Earth you're getting my"
1141,01:14:48.29,01:14:48.29,my vote. Thanks for playing.
1142,01:14:50.17,01:14:50.17,">> Thank you, Sham. >> Thank you."
1143,01:14:53.42,01:14:53.42,">> Wow. >> Wow, is right."
1144,01:14:56.58,01:14:56.58,">> PROBST: Brett, you're up. >> Well, first of all,"
1145,01:15:02.50,01:15:02.50,congratulations. I'm definitely proud of you
1146,01:15:04.79,01:15:04.79,"guys for, you know, at least beating us."
1147,01:15:07.25,01:15:07.25,"So, Mick, imagine for a moment you and I are going on a little"
1148,01:15:10.67,01:15:10.67,bro-date together. What kind of stuff-- what
1149,01:15:13.29,01:15:13.29,"kind of stuff would we do? >> Wait, wait, wait, what is it?"
1150,01:15:15.38,01:15:15.38,>> You and I are going to go on a bro date together.
1151,01:15:17.92,01:15:17.92,Nothing sexual. Just a little guy time.
1152,01:15:20.08,01:15:20.08,So describe what that day would entail.
1153,01:15:23.21,01:15:23.21,>> I'll wake you up with a little sweet nothing in
1154,01:15:25.00,01:15:25.00,your ear... (laughter)
1155,01:15:26.92,01:15:26.92,>> That's a good beginning. >> ...a little tickle on
1156,01:15:28.83,01:15:28.83,"the nose. No, but, uh, no, we'd get up."
1157,01:15:33.50,01:15:33.50,"We'd check out the news, and grab some eats afterwards, and"
1158,01:15:37.21,01:15:37.21,"you know, just be guys and talk about girls and, you know,"
1159,01:15:41.42,01:15:41.42,"sports and stuff like that. >> All right, sounds good."
1160,01:15:44.46,01:15:44.46,"It sounds probably like a silly question, but basically the"
1161,01:15:46.71,01:15:46.71,reason I was asking is to see to what level did you invest with
1162,01:15:50.50,01:15:50.50,myself as a human being. I appreciate your response.
1163,01:15:53.17,01:15:53.17,You're almost done. We'll get some food shortly.
1164,01:15:55.25,01:15:55.25,">> Thanks. Thanks, man. >> PROBST: Kelly."
1165,01:16:00.21,01:16:00.21,">> Hi. Nat, I'm going to start with"
1166,01:16:03.25,01:16:03.25,you. Because I think in the
1167,01:16:05.79,01:16:05.79,"beginning, we were perceived as being very similar, you know."
1168,01:16:08.12,01:16:08.12,We were both a little bit underestimated.
1169,01:16:10.12,01:16:10.12,I had to rely on myself. I was hoping for the same thing
1170,01:16:12.88,01:16:12.88,in you. I don't think you were ever on
1171,01:16:14.75,01:16:14.75,the field. I saw you always turn to call
1172,01:16:17.50,01:16:17.50,"help, whether it be these two or someone else in every"
1173,01:16:20.17,01:16:20.17,challenge. >> Can I answer to that?
1174,01:16:22.62,01:16:22.62,">> Yeah, go ahead. >> It wasn't because I had no"
1175,01:16:24.71,01:16:24.71,fight. I've given this 100%.
1176,01:16:27.46,01:16:27.46,"Yeah, maybe I'm not as good at some of the physical challenges"
1177,01:16:31.75,01:16:31.75,as some other people. I think everybody outweighed
1178,01:16:34.33,01:16:34.33,"me, but I did do things on my own, and I'll tell you, I got"
1179,01:16:38.04,01:16:38.04,better throughout the game to believe in myself.
1180,01:16:43.92,01:16:43.92,">> Russell, you've said many times you're going to lie,"
1181,01:16:48.08,01:16:48.08,"cheat, and steal your way through this game."
1182,01:16:50.71,01:16:50.71,Does that apply to your real life also?
1183,01:16:52.54,01:16:52.54,">> No, not at all. I am 100% different outside this"
1184,01:16:55.50,01:16:55.50,game. The thing that bothered me is I
1185,01:16:58.12,01:16:58.12,don't want my kids to think that this is how I really am.
1186,01:17:02.29,01:17:02.29,I'm not like this at all. I'm a totally different person
1187,01:17:05.25,01:17:05.25,"outside this game. >> Instead of lie, cheat, and"
1188,01:17:07.21,01:17:07.21,"steal in real life, maybe what three words that would replace"
1189,01:17:10.46,01:17:10.46,that? >> It might be hard to believe
1190,01:17:13.12,01:17:13.12,"but honor, integrity, and loyalty."
1191,01:17:19.21,01:17:19.21,">> Russell, it's hard for me to sit here and believe that from"
1192,01:17:23.17,01:17:23.17,"you. ""Honor, integrity, and loyalty"""
1193,01:17:27.79,01:17:27.79,is the most important thing to you?
1194,01:17:30.17,01:17:30.17,>> It is the most important thing to me.
1195,01:17:32.75,01:17:32.75,>> I guess I've heard what I need to.
1196,01:17:35.67,01:17:35.67,"Good luck. >> PROBST: Thanks, Kelly."
1197,01:17:41.17,01:17:41.17,"Monica. >> First off, I just want to"
1198,01:17:46.75,01:17:46.75,"say congratulations. Russell, you played some key"
1199,01:17:49.42,01:17:49.42,"moves, and regardless of how you got there, you're there."
1200,01:17:54.25,01:17:54.25,"Natalie, Mick, both of you seem to have played a pretty honest"
1201,01:17:58.25,01:17:58.25,"game, but I did miss passion. I want to see the fight in your"
1202,01:18:02.12,01:18:02.12,"answer for my question tonight. Mick, tell me why each of the"
1203,01:18:07.17,01:18:07.17,two people alongside you do not deserve the million dollars and
1204,01:18:11.79,01:18:11.79,"you do. >> You know, I don't think"
1205,01:18:14.96,01:18:14.96,Natalie deserves the money at all.
1206,01:18:17.29,01:18:17.29,"I don't know, you know, what she really did along the way"
1207,01:18:20.33,01:18:20.33,except align with Russell. And through their relationship
1208,01:18:23.29,01:18:23.29,"and their trust, was able to get through the game."
1209,01:18:25.46,01:18:25.46,That was it. Russell was willing to lie to
1210,01:18:28.71,01:18:28.71,"people, pit people against each other, mislead anybody, and all"
1211,01:18:32.54,01:18:32.54,"the while, you know, this giant ego just got really kind of out"
1212,01:18:35.67,01:18:35.67,of hand and obsessive and I don't think that that kind of
1213,01:18:38.33,01:18:38.33,character behavior deserves a million bucks.
1214,01:18:41.25,01:18:41.25,You don't reward that. >> Can I say something?
1215,01:18:43.83,01:18:43.83,"You know, he's sitting over here saying I pit people"
1216,01:18:46.12,01:18:46.12,against each other. You pit people against each
1217,01:18:48.62,01:18:48.62,"other, also. >> Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude."
1218,01:18:50.88,01:18:50.88,">> And also, this next thing... >> We're trying to-- I'm "
1219,01:18:53.00,01:18:53.00,answering her question. >> I asked if I could speak.
1220,01:18:55.83,01:18:55.83,He didn't mind when I was being a snake and giving me
1221,01:18:58.79,01:18:58.79,high-fives every time we vote somebody off.
1222,01:19:01.25,01:19:01.25,>> I never gave you high-fives. >> Natalie didn't mind when I
1223,01:19:04.00,01:19:04.00,was being a snake and giving me high-fives when I voted
1224,01:19:06.21,01:19:06.21,everybody off. The two honest people here--
1225,01:19:08.42,01:19:08.42,"they were congratulating me. ""Good job."
1226,01:19:10.75,01:19:10.75,"That was probably one of the best jobs in history, Russell"
1227,01:19:13.00,01:19:13.00,You are doing... you are running...
1228,01:19:14.88,01:19:14.88,"You should win this game. You're running the show here."""
1229,01:19:17.17,01:19:17.17,>> You did a great job. Those were great moves.
1230,01:19:19.08,01:19:19.08,>> They both-- they both didn't mind following the snake right
1231,01:19:23.12,01:19:23.12,behind me the whole step of the way.
1232,01:19:26.04,01:19:26.04,>> I think I'm basically done. >> PROBST: Dave.
1233,01:19:31.04,01:19:31.04,">> Hey, everybody. I do have one thing."
1234,01:19:33.88,01:19:33.88,"I'm curious, I'm just going to ask everybody, what do you"
1235,01:19:36.04,01:19:36.04,"think your chances are tonight? What do you think, Mick?"
1236,01:19:38.79,01:19:38.79,">> My chances are, after this, maybe 25%, 20%."
1237,01:19:44.21,01:19:44.21,">> Natalie, what do you think your chances are?"
1238,01:19:46.33,01:19:46.33,>> I'm going with maybe 30. >> 30%?
1239,01:19:48.96,01:19:48.96,">> 30% to 40% chance. >> Right on. Good game, Mama."
1240,01:19:52.04,01:19:52.04,>> Thank you. >> You're welcome. Great job.
1241,01:19:54.12,01:19:54.12,"What do you say, Russ? >> I came in here with a lot"
1242,01:19:58.12,01:19:58.12,larger percentage but it went down to about 55%.
1243,01:20:01.46,01:20:01.46,">> 55? >> Yeah, I think that it's..."
1244,01:20:03.92,01:20:03.92,"it just might happen, might not happen."
1245,01:20:06.96,01:20:06.96,">> All right, thanks everybody. >> Thanks, Dave."
1246,01:20:08.88,01:20:08.88,">> Yeah, you bet. >> PROBST: Laura, you're up."
1247,01:20:15.25,01:20:15.25,">> Hi. Russell, what did you learn"
1248,01:20:20.04,01:20:20.04,about me that enabled you to beat me?
1249,01:20:23.62,01:20:23.62,">> I knew immediately you was the biggest threat on Galu, and"
1250,01:20:27.92,01:20:27.92,that you were controlling a lot. That's what I thought.
1251,01:20:31.04,01:20:31.04,"Whether that was true or not, I don't know."
1252,01:20:34.04,01:20:34.04,"But if-if it wouldn't have took place like it did, I don't have"
1253,01:20:39.42,01:20:39.42,a doubt in my mind you would be here right now.
1254,01:20:43.12,01:20:43.12,">> PROBST: Thanks, Laura. John, your turn."
1255,01:20:52.04,01:20:52.04,">> Mick, give me the hard sell. Why should I write your name"
1256,01:20:56.17,01:20:56.17,"down? Hard sell, blow my mind"
1257,01:20:58.71,01:20:58.71,right now. >> In terms of character you're
1258,01:21:00.58,01:21:00.58,"not going to find a better, more solid guy up here."
1259,01:21:02.58,01:21:02.58,You're just not. I'm one of those people that
1260,01:21:04.67,01:21:04.67,does not think that the ends justify the means and you
1261,01:21:07.54,01:21:07.54,don't treat people like pawns. That's not my way of
1262,01:21:11.12,01:21:11.12,maneuvering through life or the game.
1263,01:21:13.08,01:21:13.08,That's essentially the type of person that you're giving
1264,01:21:15.04,01:21:15.04,money to. I don't think you can give it
1265,01:21:17.25,01:21:17.25,to a more stand-up dude up here. I just don't.
1266,01:21:20.25,01:21:20.25,">> Good. Natalie, you admittedly got"
1267,01:21:23.12,01:21:23.12,here tucked under Russell's wing.
1268,01:21:25.62,01:21:25.62,And I value that. But what do you say to the
1269,01:21:28.17,01:21:28.17,"person who's thinking, you know what, you've got to win it"
1270,01:21:31.67,01:21:31.67,"now, kid. >> It's not that you tuck under"
1271,01:21:33.75,01:21:33.75,someone's wing. It's you're smart enough to see
1272,01:21:36.79,01:21:36.79,why are they taking these people out?
1273,01:21:39.08,01:21:39.08,The most aggressive female was voted out first.
1274,01:21:42.38,01:21:42.38,I saw that from day one. Betsy was gone second.
1275,01:21:46.17,01:21:46.17,Liz was gone. I was the last girl standing.
1276,01:21:48.29,01:21:48.29,"I killed a rat, for crying out loud."
1277,01:21:51.08,01:21:51.08,">> Not to interrupt, but you're definitely illuminating part of"
1278,01:21:54.21,01:21:54.21,your strategic thinking that I think some of us were hoping to
1279,01:21:57.33,01:21:57.33,see tonight. Thanks to all of you.
1280,01:21:59.17,01:21:59.17,"That was fun. >> PROBST: Thanks, John."
1281,01:22:01.88,01:22:01.88,"Erik, close it out. >> I'm going to try to keep"
1282,01:22:07.17,01:22:07.17,"this brief, but I don't need anything from any of you."
1283,01:22:10.58,01:22:10.58,"Mick, day one, they put a leadership necklace around your"
1284,01:22:15.04,01:22:15.04,neck. I go 39 days struggling to find
1285,01:22:19.42,01:22:19.42,a reason that you deserve that title.
1286,01:22:23.33,01:22:23.33,You did nothing. You did nothing with your team.
1287,01:22:27.79,01:22:27.79,You did nothing to encourage them.
1288,01:22:29.79,01:22:29.79,Nobody on that team had any guts.
1289,01:22:33.04,01:22:33.04,"You're responsible for that. Russell, this hurts me."
1290,01:22:39.21,01:22:39.21,"We have nothing in common. You played an unethical game,"
1291,01:22:45.67,01:22:45.67,admittedly played an unethical game.
1292,01:22:48.17,01:22:48.17,The crazy thing about it is is you're sitting there and I'm
1293,01:22:51.33,01:22:51.33,standing here. Did you get to the right place
1294,01:22:54.04,01:22:54.04,by behaving the wrong way? I've never been in a situation
1295,01:22:56.88,01:22:56.88,"in my entire life where that he was the case, but you sit there"
1296,01:23:00.04,01:23:00.04,"proud of it. Natalie, people will call you"
1297,01:23:05.21,01:23:05.21,weak. People will say that you are
1298,01:23:07.50,01:23:07.50,undeserving. But you know what?
1299,01:23:10.54,01:23:10.54,"Why are those characteristics any less admirable as lying,"
1300,01:23:15.17,01:23:15.17,"cheating, and stealing? Why does he get a free pass,"
1301,01:23:18.75,01:23:18.75,but your wrong way of playing is admonished.
1302,01:23:22.58,01:23:22.58,If there's one thing that I learned in this game it is that
1303,01:23:24.96,01:23:24.96,perception is not reality. Reality is reality.
1304,01:23:30.54,01:23:30.54,And you are sitting there and that makes you just as
1305,01:23:32.67,01:23:32.67,dangerous as any one of those guys there.
1306,01:23:35.17,01:23:35.17,You would say that you were probably the least deserving of
1307,01:23:37.38,01:23:37.38,"the title of sole survivor. But maybe, just maybe, in an"
1308,01:23:42.08,01:23:42.08,"environment filled with arrogance, delusional"
1309,01:23:47.04,01:23:47.04,"entitlement, maybe the person who thinks that she's least"
1310,01:23:52.25,01:23:52.25,deserving is probably the most. You got my vote.
1311,01:23:56.83,01:23:56.83,I hope you get four more. Congratulations.
1312,01:24:04.00,01:24:04.00,">> PROBST: Jury, thanks for a very lively and interesting"
