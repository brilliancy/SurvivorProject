72,00:04:57.08,00:04:57.08,"know where it's at.This is Survivor, and you"
73,00:05:00.38,00:05:00.38,don't know what these otherpeople are thinking around here.

100,00:07:03.96,00:07:03.96,"my book, because J.T. is theslimiest guy out here."
101,00:07:08.54,00:07:08.54,He's running the tribe.He's got a little best friend
102,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"interest with everybody.And every vote, he's been the"

104,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,trying to figure out which wayis J.T. going to go.
105,00:07:20.62,00:07:20.62,And nobody calls him out.I'm afraid to ever say anything
106,00:07:24.96,00:07:24.96,"about J.T., because he's, like,the golden boy, you know."
107,00:07:29.54,00:07:29.54,He's always right abouteverything.
108,00:07:31.58,00:07:31.58,"Like, he's always in witheverybody."

113,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,rid of him and the idol or getrid of the idol.
114,00:07:56.83,00:07:56.83,Either way.J.T.'s dangerous.

120,00:08:33.88,00:08:33.88,here.And I'm worried.
121,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,"I mean, people are shuttingdown, and you can see it."

134,00:09:16.33,00:09:16.33,I think we should take it.>> I think we should take
135,00:09:18.17,00:09:18.17,everything.>> Just in case we don't come
136,00:09:19.62,00:09:19.62,back.I'm hoping and praying that it's
137,00:09:22.12,00:09:22.12,a merge.And we don't know where
138,00:09:24.50,00:09:24.50,"we're going to end up, so wedefinitely want to get all of"

295,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,>> It was a silly move.>> The moment Boston Rob
296,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,"left the game, I knewthe guys were not in control"
297,00:17:32.12,00:17:32.12,because he was theirbest competitor.
298,00:17:34.12,00:17:34.12,So it's obvious; there's anall-woman's alliance over there.
299,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,>> The girls are gonnaexpect you guys to jump

306,00:17:53.17,00:17:53.17,"So right now, I think we stickto our plan and just"
307,00:17:55.79,00:17:55.79,keep dominating.We're still losing.
308,00:17:58.88,00:17:58.88,We got 'em on the hills.>> I love you all.

313,00:18:30.46,00:18:30.46,"packing up the whole camp,just assuming there was"
314,00:18:32.50,00:18:32.50,gonna be a merge.Are you kidding me?
315,00:18:35.96,00:18:35.96,"You know, voting off Robwas a big mistake."
316,00:18:38.08,00:18:38.08,He would have made surethat Sandra and Courtney
317,00:18:39.96,00:18:39.96,"did not sit out today, thatthey played, and they we had"
318,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,strong people in the immunitychallenge.
319,00:18:54.54,00:18:54.54,>> We already made that mistakeonce and we just let it
320,00:18:58.12,00:18:58.12,happen again.I looked at both of them
321,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,"of them and I said, ""You guys,can you do this?"""
322,00:19:02.79,00:19:02.79,"And they're, like, ""Um,I don't know."""
323,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,">> You said, you said, no,you said, ""I don't know."""
324,00:19:11.96,00:19:11.96,">> It's, like, so now it's meand Courtney's fault that you"
325,00:19:14.58,00:19:14.58,"guys lost?>> No, no, it's not."
326,00:19:16.62,00:19:16.62,That's not what I'm saying.I'm saying why did this stupid
327,00:19:19.42,00:19:19.42,mistake get made again that wemade the last time?
328,00:19:21.50,00:19:21.50,>> He's the onethat said Sandra and Courtney.
329,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,>> I know.>> So then me and Courtney
330,00:19:25.12,00:19:25.12,"are looking like, ""Okay, so thenwe'll both have to compete in"
331,00:19:27.46,00:19:27.46,the immunity challenge.That's a big mistake.
332,00:19:29.88,00:19:29.88,">> Yeah, I said the same thing,but it was Coach."
333,00:19:33.46,00:19:33.46,"You said, ""I really wantpizza."""
334,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,"And I said, ""We don't needpizza."
335,00:19:36.83,00:19:36.83,We need an immunity.>> We need to eat
336,00:19:38.50,00:19:38.50,and we need to win.Sandra and Courtney.
337,00:19:40.42,00:19:40.42,Why are youblaming me and Courtney?
338,00:19:42.21,00:19:42.21,>> I'm not blaming youand Courtney.
339,00:19:43.38,00:19:43.38,>> Why? We didn't evendo anything.
340,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,">> All I'm saying is thatif even once, you guys"
341,00:19:46.92,00:19:46.92,"were like, ""Hell, yeah,""put me in there!"
342,00:19:48.75,00:19:48.75,"I want to go."">> So, in essence,"
343,00:19:50.33,00:19:50.33,the reason we lost today wasbecause he and Courtney sat out.
344,00:19:53.25,00:19:53.25,">> Again, no, that's notwhat it has to do with, again."
345,00:19:55.92,00:19:55.92,">> I just don't understand.The minute we get back to camp,"
346,00:19:58.12,00:19:58.12,"and you guys don't have a meal,all of a sudden, it's me"
347,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,and Courtney.The worst tribe ever put
348,00:20:03.17,00:20:03.17,together is the Villains tribe.I should not even be here.
349,00:20:06.96,00:20:06.96,I should be with the Heroes'cause I can't stand Jerri.
350,00:20:10.96,00:20:10.96,"I hate Coach, I hate Danielle.I hate Russell even more."
351,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,So any of those--I'm not going to pick one above
352,00:20:18.17,00:20:18.17,the other 'cause I equally hatethem all.
353,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,">> Tyson's gone,Rob's gone, and now we're the"
354,00:20:27.29,00:20:27.29,ones on the outs.And it's 5-2.
355,00:20:34.29,00:20:34.29,Russell's the kind ofperson where if he finds out
356,00:20:36.62,00:20:36.62,"somebody's gunning for him,he'll take them out."
357,00:20:40.00,00:20:40.00,"if one of us is going next..I'll be like, ""Hey, Russell."
358,00:20:48.67,00:20:48.67,"Coach wants you gone.""And I bet you Russell"
359,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"will believe me and getrid of Coach, and me and"
360,00:20:54.17,00:20:54.17,Courtney will be saved again.I'm going to work
361,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,my magic and we're both goingto be here on day 22 and day 23.
362,00:21:20.38,00:21:20.38,I didn't want to playthis game without Tyson.
363,00:21:22.79,00:21:22.79,I didn't want to play thisgame without Boston Rob.
364,00:21:25.12,00:21:25.12,And it's like all that'sout the window.
365,00:21:27.17,00:21:27.17,">> I guess that maybeyou feel guilty or something,"
366,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,but I know I'm the next oneto go.
367,00:21:32.38,00:21:32.38,"And what else is there to say,you know?"
368,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,It's based onRussell's idea of what he wants
369,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,"his Survivor to be like, andeveryone's going along with it"
370,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,"out of, like, fear or something.>> Yeah."
371,00:21:58.79,00:21:58.79,>> Oh.>> But it don't
372,00:22:00.58,00:22:00.58,matter what she says.I will tell them
373,00:22:03.75,00:22:03.75,this is how we're voting.And that's how it's going to be.
374,00:22:08.25,00:22:08.25,"That simple.>> But at the same time, I heard"
375,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,Coach was saying that he made amistake and he wished he could

550,00:32:24.38,00:32:24.38,(groans)I think it's really stupid
551,00:32:28.38,00:32:28.38,to get rid of anotherstrong player.
552,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,"I mean, Courtney and Sandracan't do anything in"
553,00:32:32.71,00:32:32.71,the challenge.They've proved that to us a
554,00:32:34.50,00:32:34.50,"million times over.I mean, Courtney was just"
555,00:32:37.25,00:32:37.25,pathetic.And I think we have a shot at
556,00:32:39.58,00:32:39.58,"least with Coach.So, I mean, I threw that out"
557,00:32:43.46,00:32:43.46,"there, and Russell freaked outand screamed at me because he's"
558,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,"just so in control of this game,and everything has to go the"
559,00:32:50.79,00:32:50.79,"way he wants it to go.So, I mean, as of right now, I'm"
560,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,up in the air.I got to really think about what
561,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,I want to do.>> Because she's such a
562,00:33:07.96,00:33:07.96,competitor.You know what I'm saying?
563,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,"She was like, ""I'm donesuggesting things."""
564,00:33:13.38,00:33:13.38,So I think she must havesuggested something to Russell.
565,00:33:20.46,00:33:20.46,">> If my plan to vote out Coachdoesn't work, I think Courtney"
566,00:33:23.75,00:33:23.75,is going home.I put a bug in Russell's ear
567,00:33:26.29,00:33:26.29,that Coach wants to get rid ofhim.
568,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50,But Russell was talking toDanielle a few minutes ago.
569,00:33:31.58,00:33:31.58,And the conversation-- it lookedlike it was going back and
570,00:33:34.12,00:33:34.12,forth.So I don't know.
571,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,"All I can do is hope that Coachis going to go home, and that's"
572,00:33:39.08,00:33:39.08,it.>> Do you know where the saw is?
573,00:33:48.12,00:33:48.12,The one that we open coconutswith?
574,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,>> I think Danielle might beright.
575,00:33:56.08,00:33:56.08,We might need to keep him onemore time.
576,00:33:58.46,00:33:58.46,"We can always take him out, anytime we want."
577,00:34:02.58,00:34:02.58,I think we should vote Courtney.>> It's absurd.
578,00:34:07.00,00:34:07.00,"First, Russell wants to voteoff Coach."
579,00:34:09.25,00:34:09.25,"And then, all of a sudden, hewants to vote Courtney."
580,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,Jeez!This tribe cannot get its act
581,00:34:15.00,00:34:15.00,together.That's a problem.
582,00:34:16.67,00:34:16.67,"You know, we can't make adecision as a cohesive unit to"
583,00:34:19.96,00:34:19.96,save our lives.>> We couldn't be no cooler.
584,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,">> Hopefully, we all cometogether and vote out the"

586,00:34:33.83,00:34:33.83,"They might still get togetherand, say, vote off the weakest"
587,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,and target me and vote me out.You never know what's going to
588,00:34:40.12,00:34:40.12,happen between now and when thesun goes down.
589,00:34:58.92,00:34:58.92,>> PROBST: Let's start tonight'sTribal Council by going back
590,00:35:02.54,00:35:02.54,to the last two Tribal Councils.Tyson and Rob-- the result:
591,00:35:06.42,00:35:06.42,four straight losses with noend in sight.
592,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,"Danielle, any second thoughtsabout voting out Tyson and Rob?"
593,00:35:14.08,00:35:14.08,">> This decision was made.We thought it would be smarter,"
594,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,because they were such bigthreats.
595,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,"So, it is what it is, Jeff.We thought what we did was the"
596,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,right thing to do.>> PROBST: But in a physical
597,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,"challenge, the only person whowon a point today was Coach."
598,00:35:28.96,00:35:28.96,>> Ah.>> PROBST: And if given the
599,00:35:30.33,00:35:30.33,"choice of Tyson or Boston Robover, say, Courtney, I think 99"
600,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,out of 100 people would probablypick Tyson or Boston Rob-- no
601,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,"disrespect.>> Thank you, Jeffrey."
602,00:35:40.58,00:35:40.58,">> PROBST: Courtney, you've satout a majority of the"

604,00:35:44.83,00:35:44.83,to do.I don't have a big ego that has
605,00:35:46.71,00:35:46.71,to go and run and play in everysingle thing.
606,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,"I wasn't a part of the decisionto vote out Tyson or Rob, so"
607,00:35:52.92,00:35:52.92,I'm sad that they're both gone.But insulting me is not going
608,00:35:56.33,00:35:56.33,to bring them back.>> PROBST: It's not meant as an
609,00:35:58.21,00:35:58.21,insult.It's meant as just one person's
610,00:36:00.79,00:36:00.79,observation.Boston Rob was dominating.
611,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,>> I agree with you.>> PROBST: But Danielle just
612,00:36:06.54,00:36:06.54,told me that's why you votedhim out.
613,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,>> I didn't vote him out of ourtribe.
614,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,"The tribe voted him out, becausehe was not in the dominating"
615,00:36:14.08,00:36:14.08,"alliance.>> PROBST: Coach, what do you"
616,00:36:17.25,00:36:17.25,think the take is on this tribefrom the outside looking in?
617,00:36:21.88,00:36:21.88,>> I personally feel likepeople are probably laughing at
618,00:36:24.79,00:36:24.79,us right now and saying that wedeserve it.
619,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,"Like, today, when we weregetting ready for the"
620,00:36:28.71,00:36:28.71,"challenge, I was trying toenergize people and I was, like,"
621,00:36:30.67,00:36:30.67,"saying, ""All right, come on,guys, let's do it."""
622,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,"And I had comments like, ""Well,I'm gonna do my best."""
623,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,">> PROBST: Courtney, you're nothaving any of that."
624,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,">> When, you know, it's a rewardchallenge, it was Coach saying,"

626,00:36:44.38,00:36:44.38,"And then, ""I don't care aboutthe immunity challenge, 'cause"

628,00:36:48.62,00:36:48.62,"And then, obviously, it willbe one of the us going home."
629,00:36:50.75,00:36:50.75,>> So what I hear from you isthat the reason why our morale
630,00:36:53.33,00:36:53.33,is down is because of me.Is that what I'm hearing?
631,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,>> PROBST: That's what I heard.>> This is crazy.
632,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"I don't sit there and makeunilateral decisions and say,"
633,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,"""By the way, Courtney andSandra, you guys should sit out"
634,00:37:02.21,00:37:02.21,"every challenge.""I've never said that, because"

636,00:37:06.21,00:37:06.21,never make a foolhardy statementlike that.
637,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,"But what we all want as a tribeis for Courtney to say, ""I want"
638,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"to do that 'cause I can beatthat challenge."""
639,00:37:14.21,00:37:14.21,">> Thanks, Dad.>> He's a Coach."
640,00:37:16.42,00:37:16.42,That's what he does.He tries to pick people up.
641,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,">> I'm not saying that you don'tmean well, it's just the way"
642,00:37:19.92,00:37:19.92,"that...>> Well, it certainly sounds"
643,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,like it when you say that I'mdemoralizing the entire tribe.
644,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,"Trust me, I am not the personthat is demoralizing this tribe."
645,00:37:27.54,00:37:27.54,"In fact, it has absolutelynothing to do with me."

649,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,end go down.>> I don't think it's that hard
650,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,to see that we are definitelyless athletic than them.
651,00:37:45.62,00:37:45.62,"So if we continue to do thesephysical challenges, they're"
652,00:37:48.79,00:37:48.79,"going to slaughter us, and we'regoing to go, one by one, down"
