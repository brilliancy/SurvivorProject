1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00," >> JEFF PROBST: Last week, 20"
2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,seasons of Survivor led up to our most epic battle yet.
3,00:00:06.21,00:00:06.21,"Rob Mariano, one of the game's ultimate strategists, and also"
4,00:00:09.50,00:00:09.50,"one of the biggest double dealers, had recreated himself"
5,00:00:12.62,00:00:12.62,as a hero. >> A lot has happened with me
6,00:00:15.17,00:00:15.17,personally in my life in the six years since I've played
7,00:00:18.00,00:00:18.00,this game. I'm learning compromise and
8,00:00:20.08,00:00:20.08,patience. >> PROBST: He led his tribe of
9,00:00:21.50,00:00:21.50,Villains by being a straight shooter and working hard.
10,00:00:24.04,00:00:24.04,>> I'm in awe of Rob. You are the man.
11,00:00:26.12,00:00:26.12,"And it's like, when you talk, I'm literally hanging on"
12,00:00:27.62,00:00:27.62,every word. >> I appreciate it.
13,00:00:28.92,00:00:28.92,">> PROBST: Because of his efforts, the tribe flourished."
14,00:00:31.21,00:00:31.21,Rob jumps down on the final piece!
15,00:00:33.58,00:00:33.58,Villains win immunity! But he made an enemy of Russell.
16,00:00:37.96,00:00:37.96,">> Watch your back, man. >> Yeah, well, same thing for"
17,00:00:40.17,00:00:40.17,"you, man. >> PROBST: Who used lies,"
18,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,intimidation and chaos to further his own self-interest.
19,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,">> I'm that good, where I can bring people together in this"
20,00:00:48.62,00:00:48.62,game for my good. >> PROBST: So Rob's leadership
21,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,was short-lived. >> My idea of trust and loyalty
22,00:00:56.92,00:00:56.92,is different from Russell's. >> PROBST: Motivated by
23,00:00:59.00,00:00:59.00,"jealousy, Russell used his power of persuasion and"
24,00:01:02.17,00:01:02.17,gathered enough votes to eliminate his adversary.
25,00:01:05.54,00:01:05.54,Rob. The loss of Rob has given the
26,00:01:08.62,00:01:08.62,"Heroes a chance at a comeback. Now, they're down only two"
27,00:01:11.96,00:01:11.96,members. (shrieks happily)
28,00:01:12.96,00:01:12.96,And they've even discovered a clue to a hidden immunity idol.
29,00:01:15.58,00:01:15.58,>> We're going to look for it together.
30,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,>> PROBST: But the bigger question: how will losing
31,00:01:19.33,00:01:19.33,Rob's leadership and challenge dominance impact the Villain
32,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,tribe? >> The waters are so muddy
33,00:01:25.25,00:01:25.25,"right now. I mean, we were in the best"
34,00:01:27.08,00:01:27.08,"position possible. >> PROBST: Coach, Courtney and"
35,00:01:29.46,00:01:29.46,"Sandra refused to vote for Rob, and now they're trapped in a"
36,00:01:33.08,00:01:33.08,"tribe controlled by Russell, whose ego may have just put the"
37,00:01:36.12,00:01:36.12,Villains in a hole they can't get out of.
38,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,(laughs) >> Boston Rob was after me.
39,00:02:04.75,00:02:04.75,You know what? I just won.
40,00:02:06.58,00:02:06.58,"Big-time Boston Rob, the super All-Star-- he ain't nothing on"
41,00:02:11.08,00:02:11.08,"me. >> It's, like, game on now, huh?"
42,00:02:13.08,00:02:13.08,">> I'm controlling this game. I'll take care of all of them,"
43,00:02:16.08,00:02:16.08,one at a time. This is Russell Hantz.
44,00:02:18.12,00:02:18.12,"If you ain't with me, you're against me."
45,00:02:24.62,00:02:24.62,>> It's fun. >> So much fun.
46,00:02:26.46,00:02:26.46,>> I only like doing it to people that deserve it.
47,00:02:28.46,00:02:28.46,">> Me, too. (women laughing)"
48,00:02:30.08,00:02:30.08,>> I did not want Boston Rob out.
49,00:02:32.17,00:02:32.17,We screwed up the whole tribe. Ridiculous that they're cowards
50,00:02:35.25,00:02:35.25,"and they want to vote out Boston Rob, because Russell is a"
51,00:02:38.33,00:02:38.33,"bully. No more, no less."
52,00:02:40.46,00:02:40.46,"He's a bully. >> I mean, I didn't want to"
53,00:02:45.46,00:02:45.46,"vote off Rob this early, either. I really didn't."
54,00:02:47.71,00:02:47.71,"And the more I thought about it, the more I was really upset"
55,00:02:50.08,00:02:50.08,about it. I miss him already.
56,00:02:57.33,00:02:57.33,>> I wasn't quick to get rid of him.
57,00:02:59.17,00:02:59.17,What are you talking about? >> I feel like Jerri made a big
58,00:03:03.17,00:03:03.17,mistake in aligning with Russell.
59,00:03:05.04,00:03:05.04,"Now I'm forced to go that direction, and I feel at this"
60,00:03:09.04,00:03:09.04,point that it's an alliance based on lies.
61,00:03:15.50,00:03:15.50,Are we going to the final five with them or are we going to
62,00:03:18.04,00:03:18.04,try to make a play? >> I say we just see what
63,00:03:23.83,00:03:23.83,happens at the merge. >> The Villains are in the
64,00:03:27.25,00:03:27.25,crapper. I don't think we'll win another
65,00:03:28.88,00:03:28.88,challenge. We're done.
66,00:03:30.92,00:03:30.92,We're toast. Pray for the merge.
67,00:03:35.00,00:03:35.00,(theme song playing) >> Beautiful.
68,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,How high up do you want to go?
69,00:04:42.79,00:04:42.79,>> I say we bring it up pretty high.
70,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,>> Where's J.T.? >> I don't know.
71,00:04:50.04,00:04:50.04,>> The Hero tribe has plans to look for the hidden immunity
72,00:04:53.21,00:04:53.21,"idol as a group, but the best thing for me is to make sure I"
73,00:04:57.08,00:04:57.08,"know where it's at. This is Survivor, and you"
74,00:05:00.38,00:05:00.38,don't know what these other people are thinking around here.
75,00:05:03.42,00:05:03.42,The clue said that the idol's in the creek or something.
76,00:05:06.96,00:05:06.96,So I'm just going to swing by there and take a gander.
77,00:05:34.25,00:05:34.25,Perfect. I'm going to get the hell out
78,00:05:37.54,00:05:37.54,of here while I still can. >> You just found it now?
79,00:05:50.92,00:05:50.92,"Oh, my God. >> Let's get out of here."
80,00:05:52.50,00:05:52.50,"Immediately after I found it, I was like, you know what?"
81,00:05:54.96,00:05:54.96,"I better get out of here, 'cause I wasn't sure if I was going to"
82,00:05:57.33,00:05:57.33,"tell anyone. And before I could even move,"
83,00:05:59.92,00:05:59.92,"Amanda walked up, so I was like, well, I'll show her."
84,00:06:06.17,00:06:06.17,>> You found it? >> I just found it.
85,00:06:07.79,00:06:07.79,"Then, immediately, Candice walked up, so I was like, you"
86,00:06:10.17,00:06:10.17,"know what, if I come clean, our tribe will come together."
87,00:06:13.83,00:06:13.83,"No one is going to vote me out, because I have it."
88,00:06:20.62,00:06:20.62,>> Right behind that tree. (laughs)
89,00:06:23.54,00:06:23.54,"I walked up, back up my alone walk..."
90,00:06:25.67,00:06:25.67,>> Yeah. >> Five minutes.
91,00:06:27.04,00:06:27.04,>> Can I see it? >> Yeah.
92,00:06:28.46,00:06:28.46,"The first one of us that needs this after the merge, we'll use"
93,00:06:31.38,00:06:31.38,it. >> It's a beautiful thing.
94,00:06:32.88,00:06:32.88,>> Yep. >> And we're taking them down
95,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,with it. >> Nice.
96,00:06:35.50,00:06:35.50,>> Beautiful. >> Colby!
97,00:06:37.17,00:06:37.17,">> Sweet! Nice work, brother."
98,00:06:44.25,00:06:44.25,>> You want some coconut? >> I'm good.
99,00:06:51.21,00:06:51.21,>> Good thing you walked up. How close was that?
100,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67,"J.T. found the hidden immunity idol, which is not so great in"
101,00:07:03.96,00:07:03.96,"my book, because J.T. is the slimiest guy out here."
102,00:07:08.54,00:07:08.54,He's running the tribe. He's got a little best friend
103,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"interest with everybody. And every vote, he's been the"
104,00:07:15.08,00:07:15.08,"one that's going back and forth, and everybody's coming to him,"
105,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,trying to figure out which way is J.T. going to go.
106,00:07:20.62,00:07:20.62,And nobody calls him out. I'm afraid to ever say anything
107,00:07:24.96,00:07:24.96,"about J.T., because he's, like, the golden boy, you know."
108,00:07:29.54,00:07:29.54,He's always right about everything.
109,00:07:31.58,00:07:31.58,"Like, he's always in with everybody."
110,00:07:34.46,00:07:34.46,>> Yeah. >> Right?
111,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,Isn't he in with you? >> Is he in with you?
112,00:07:43.58,00:07:43.58,>> Isn't he in with Rupert? Isn't he in with Colby?
113,00:07:50.12,00:07:50.12,>> It would be in Amanda's best interest to work with me to get
114,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,rid of him and the idol or get rid of the idol.
115,00:07:56.83,00:07:56.83,Either way. J.T.'s dangerous.
116,00:08:19.33,00:08:19.33,>> I know. >> We're all going to die.
117,00:08:26.42,00:08:26.42,">> No, we're not. >> Yeah, we will."
118,00:08:28.25,00:08:28.25,">> No, we won't. >> You can't not eat for that"
119,00:08:30.08,00:08:30.08,"long. >> Yeah, you can."
120,00:08:31.62,00:08:31.62,It's unbelievable. We're literally starving out
121,00:08:33.88,00:08:33.88,here. And I'm worried.
122,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,"I mean, people are shutting down, and you can see it."
123,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,"I mean, we're already on our heels 'cause we're losing."
124,00:08:39.75,00:08:39.75,The time for exigency has exited.
125,00:08:42.71,00:08:42.71,"It is do-or-die out here. >> ""Now for a challenge that's"
126,00:08:47.75,00:08:47.75,"good clean fun-- no oil, no mud, no brawling."
127,00:08:52.08,00:08:52.08,It's not who strikes first but who strikes the most.
128,00:08:55.17,00:08:55.17,"Your best meal yet is calling."" >> It sounds like an individual"
129,00:08:58.58,00:08:58.58,"type thing. >> Yeah, it does."
130,00:09:02.17,00:09:02.17,">> Yeah, I mean, it doesn't say anything about tribe."
131,00:09:04.08,00:09:04.08,"""Your best meal yet is calling."" Sounds like a merge to me."
132,00:09:08.00,00:09:08.00,"Today, the Villains are all hoping that it's a merge."
133,00:09:10.33,00:09:10.33,"It's a challenge of good, clean fun, and our best meal yet is"
134,00:09:13.96,00:09:13.96,"calling, so I'm happy about that."
135,00:09:16.33,00:09:16.33,I think we should take it. >> I think we should take
136,00:09:18.17,00:09:18.17,everything. >> Just in case we don't come
137,00:09:19.62,00:09:19.62,back. I'm hoping and praying that it's
138,00:09:22.12,00:09:22.12,a merge. And we don't know where
139,00:09:24.50,00:09:24.50,"we're going to end up, so we definitely want to get all of"
140,00:09:26.75,00:09:26.75,"our stuff together and take the tools, the tarp, all of our"
141,00:09:30.08,00:09:30.08,"belongings, because we could end up somewhere else."
142,00:09:43.00,00:09:43.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! >> Oh... my God!"
143,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,">> Wow! >> Oh, look, pizza, guys."
144,00:09:52.25,00:09:52.25,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Heroes getting your
145,00:09:54.50,00:09:54.50,first look at the new Villain tribe.
146,00:09:57.33,00:09:57.33,Boston Rob voted out at the last Tribal Council.
147,00:09:59.25,00:09:59.25,">> Oh, my God. >> Wow!"
148,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,">> Wow! >> Looks like we're, uh,"
149,00:10:06.17,00:10:06.17,"merging. >> PROBST: So, Rupert, shocked"
150,00:10:11.71,00:10:11.71,that Boston Rob is gone? >> It sure looks like they got
151,00:10:14.83,00:10:14.83,a woman's alliance. >> PROBST: Time will tell.
152,00:10:19.21,00:10:19.21,>> When I found out that the Hero tribe thinks this is an
153,00:10:22.25,00:10:22.25,"all-girl alliance, I thought they're making a huge mistake,"
154,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,because there's no girl alliance over here.
155,00:10:27.96,00:10:27.96,Rob got voted out last night because of me.
156,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,"But now, if we merge, the Hero tribe-- they'll let me know"
157,00:10:34.58,00:10:34.58,whoever they're voting for if they think I'm the one that
158,00:10:36.79,00:10:36.79,flop. Why wouldn't I flop if I'm in
159,00:10:38.88,00:10:38.88,trouble? Like... help.
160,00:10:41.17,00:10:41.17,"(laughs) >> PROBST: Villains, you"
161,00:10:43.62,00:10:43.62,"brought, clearly, your entire camp."
162,00:10:47.04,00:10:47.04,"Talk to me, Russell. >> I'm sure everybody has the"
163,00:10:49.33,00:10:49.33,"merge in mind. And if there is a merge, we're"
164,00:10:52.92,00:10:52.92,"prepared, they're not. >> The first thought I had when"
165,00:10:56.17,00:10:56.17,"we saw them walk in with toolbox in hand was, okay, go"
166,00:11:00.29,00:11:00.29,back through your mind. You read the same clue they
167,00:11:01.79,00:11:01.79,"did, what did I not pick up on?"
168,00:11:04.79,00:11:04.79,">> PROBST: It's true, you have survived 18 days out here."
169,00:11:09.21,00:11:09.21,No small feat. You've survived
170,00:11:11.21,00:11:11.21,eight Tribal Councils. Very tough to do.
171,00:11:14.21,00:11:14.21,And it does seem that you deserve a bit of a break.
172,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,As you have all seen behind you...
173,00:11:18.58,00:11:18.58,>> Yes! >> PROBST: ...a very nice feast.
174,00:11:21.25,00:11:21.25,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: You'll all have"
175,00:11:24.17,00:11:24.17,an opportunity to enjoy this feast.
176,00:11:26.04,00:11:26.04,">> Oh, my God. >> Oh, wait. What?!"
177,00:11:28.21,00:11:28.21,">> Wait a minute, wait a minute! What's, what's the rub?"
178,00:11:31.04,00:11:31.04,">> PROBST: Before we move any further, let me answer the"
179,00:11:33.96,00:11:33.96,question on everybody's mind. Everybody drop
180,00:11:39.21,00:11:39.21,your... >> Yeah!
181,00:11:41.04,00:11:41.04,>> PROBST: ...expectations. (all groan)
182,00:11:44.58,00:11:44.58,>> Evil! >> PROBST: We are not merging.
183,00:11:47.62,00:11:47.62,>> Wah-wah-wah. Mean. >> Try and take it off.
184,00:11:49.50,00:11:49.50,>> PROBST: This is a reward challenge.
185,00:11:51.21,00:11:51.21,Both tribes will have an equal opportunity to win it.
186,00:11:55.21,00:11:55.21,"You win it, you eat. Losers go back to camp,"
187,00:11:57.96,00:11:57.96,"and if it is the Villains, you will clearly be"
188,00:12:00.12,00:12:00.12,putting your shelter back together.

190,00:12:03.79,00:12:03.79,"today's challenge, you're gonna do a little Survivor bowling."
191,00:12:05.92,00:12:05.92,It's very simple. You will square off
192,00:12:07.42,00:12:07.42,against a tribe member from the other tribe.
193,00:12:09.04,00:12:09.04,"Your goal: roll the ball down the lane, knock"
194,00:12:11.08,00:12:11.08,over as many pins as you can. You get two rolls.
195,00:12:14.96,00:12:14.96,Whoever knocks over the most pins scores a point for
196,00:12:17.12,00:12:17.12,their tribe. First tribe to score

201,00:12:25.67,00:12:25.67,>> Didn't you guys say that you were good at bowling?
202,00:12:27.25,00:12:27.25,">> Yeah. >> Sandra, do you want to bowl?"
203,00:12:29.17,00:12:29.17,>> This isn't open... >> PROBST: Give me an answer.
204,00:12:31.42,00:12:31.42,>> Do you like to bowl? Are you good at bowling?
205,00:12:33.88,00:12:33.88,">> Yeah, but think about it who we have to sit out"
206,00:12:36.08,00:12:36.08,in the next challenge. >> Yeah.
207,00:12:37.29,00:12:37.29,">> PROBST: Coach, who's sitting out?"
208,00:12:40.12,00:12:40.12,>> Sandra and Courtney. >> PROBST: Sandra and Courtney

212,00:12:47.08,00:12:47.08,"get started. All right, here we go."

214,00:12:54.71,00:12:54.71,"taking on Rupert for the Heroes. Parvati, give it a go."

221,00:13:16.08,00:13:16.08,"to pick up at least three. >> Gutter ball,"

228,00:13:36.04,00:13:36.04,>> Beautiful! >> Nice!

238,00:14:04.42,00:14:04.42,Danielle throws a gutter ball. Heroes now lead it two-zip.
239,00:14:08.50,00:14:08.50,"We're playing to three. Next round, Russell for the"

241,00:14:15.17,00:14:15.17,Russell is the last chance or the Villains to
242,00:14:17.62,00:14:17.62,stay in this challenge. Russell takes a
243,00:14:21.29,00:14:21.29,"little baby toss, and it results in an absolute goose"
244,00:14:24.00,00:14:24.00,egg for the Villains. Colby with his
245,00:14:27.88,00:14:27.88,"first shot for the Heroes. >> Bounce, baby!"
246,00:14:33.42,00:14:33.42,">> PROBST: Colby bounces his down the middle, also results"
247,00:14:36.71,00:14:36.71,in a gutter ball. We are zip-zip.
248,00:14:39.67,00:14:39.67,">> Go, Russell. >> Good shot."
249,00:14:45.08,00:14:45.08,>> Yeah! >> Yay!

253,00:14:56.96,00:14:56.96,knocks over one. (Colby blows raspberry)
254,00:14:59.12,00:14:59.12,Villains are on the board. >> Yay!

258,00:15:11.17,00:15:11.17,Big feast just sitting over there waiting on ya.
259,00:15:14.17,00:15:14.17,Amanda could win it for the Heroes.
260,00:15:16.67,00:15:16.67,Coach could tie it up. Coach rolls first.
261,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17,Nice roll by Coach knocking over five pins.
262,00:15:26.75,00:15:26.75,Amanda now up for the Heroes. Amanda knocks over five pins.
263,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,Two good first rolls. We're tied 5-5.
264,00:15:38.58,00:15:38.58,"Coach, you're up. Coach with his second roll..."
265,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,"knocks over one more, putting the pressure on Amanda."
266,00:15:49.21,00:15:49.21,"Amanda, to win this, you need just knock down"
267,00:15:52.79,00:15:52.79,two pins. Good roll.
268,00:16:00.25,00:16:00.25,Amanda knocks over two pins just barely!
269,00:16:04.54,00:16:04.54,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Heroes win their"
270,00:16:06.79,00:16:06.79,third-straight challenge in a row.
271,00:16:09.42,00:16:09.42,">> Good bowling, Coach. >> PROBST: Villains, got nothing"
272,00:16:12.92,00:16:12.92,for you. Grab all your stuff.
273,00:16:14.67,00:16:14.67,Head back to whatever is left of your camp.
274,00:16:21.42,00:16:21.42,"All right, Heroes, you earned it."
275,00:16:23.38,00:16:23.38,"Enjoy your feast. >> Thank you, Jeff!"
276,00:16:38.54,00:16:38.54,>> All right! >> All right!
277,00:16:40.12,00:16:40.12,">> Oh, my God! >> Come on in, guys!"
278,00:16:42.50,00:16:42.50,>> Yay! >> This is so awesome!
279,00:16:45.17,00:16:45.17,>> Shall we? >> Cheers!
280,00:16:46.42,00:16:46.42,>> Cheers! >> Cheers!
281,00:16:49.62,00:16:49.62,">> Good job, you guys. >> Mmm..."
282,00:16:51.75,00:16:51.75,">> You guys, we kicked ass today."
283,00:16:54.67,00:16:54.67,I love all y'all. Best team on Survivor
284,00:16:56.62,00:16:56.62,right here. >> The fantastic five.
285,00:16:59.04,00:16:59.04,">> Yay! >> I mean, I don't want"
286,00:17:01.21,00:17:01.21,"to jinx us here, but we're on a little bit of a roll."
287,00:17:04.29,00:17:04.29,But the Villains still have the numbers.
288,00:17:06.04,00:17:06.04,"So, in our minds, we're still catching up."
289,00:17:08.96,00:17:08.96,We don't want to get overconfident.
290,00:17:10.29,00:17:10.29,We just want to keep it going. >> This is good.
291,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,">> Oh, God, this is good. >> I was not ready to merge yet."
292,00:17:17.04,00:17:17.04,">> No, not yet. We need to knock"
293,00:17:18.88,00:17:18.88,two more of them out. >> How about Boston rob?
294,00:17:21.33,00:17:21.33,(Rupert laughs) >> Crazy.
295,00:17:23.04,00:17:23.04,>> Insane voting him out! >> It was a bold move.
296,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,>> It was a silly move. >> The moment Boston Rob
297,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,"left the game, I knew the guys were not in control"
298,00:17:32.12,00:17:32.12,because he was their best competitor.
299,00:17:34.12,00:17:34.12,So it's obvious; there's an all-woman's alliance over there.
300,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,>> The girls are gonna expect you guys to jump
301,00:17:39.12,00:17:39.12,"in their girl alliance, but I know..."
302,00:17:40.79,00:17:40.79,>> We would be the first ones to find out who
303,00:17:42.71,00:17:42.71,they're voting for. >> That's the whole thing.
304,00:17:44.67,00:17:44.67,>> Now Coach and Russell are on the outs over there.
305,00:17:47.88,00:17:47.88,"They're sitting ducks. If we merge right now,"
306,00:17:50.92,00:17:50.92,"we've got them on our side in a heartbeat, you know?"
307,00:17:53.17,00:17:53.17,"So right now, I think we stick to our plan and just"
308,00:17:55.79,00:17:55.79,keep dominating. We're still losing.
309,00:17:58.88,00:17:58.88,We got 'em on the hills. >> I love you all.
310,00:18:01.54,00:18:01.54,">> I love you, too. >> It's a family, guys."
311,00:18:03.50,00:18:03.50,">> Hear, hear. >> To the fantastic five."
312,00:18:26.17,00:18:26.17,>> Every single person on this team is an idiot.
313,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,"I just, I'm furious. This whole stupid thing,"
314,00:18:30.46,00:18:30.46,"packing up the whole camp, just assuming there was"
315,00:18:32.50,00:18:32.50,gonna be a merge. Are you kidding me?
316,00:18:35.96,00:18:35.96,"You know, voting off Rob was a big mistake."
317,00:18:38.08,00:18:38.08,He would have made sure that Sandra and Courtney
318,00:18:39.96,00:18:39.96,"did not sit out today, that they played, and they we had"
319,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,strong people in the immunity challenge.
320,00:18:54.54,00:18:54.54,>> We already made that mistake once and we just let it
321,00:18:58.12,00:18:58.12,happen again. I looked at both of them
322,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,"of them and I said, ""You guys, can you do this?"""
323,00:19:02.79,00:19:02.79,"And they're, like, ""Um, I don't know."""
324,00:19:08.79,00:19:08.79,">> You said, you said, no, you said, ""I don't know."""
325,00:19:11.96,00:19:11.96,">> It's, like, so now it's me and Courtney's fault that you"
326,00:19:14.58,00:19:14.58,"guys lost? >> No, no, it's not."
327,00:19:16.62,00:19:16.62,That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying why did this stupid
328,00:19:19.42,00:19:19.42,mistake get made again that we made the last time?
329,00:19:21.50,00:19:21.50,>> He's the one that said Sandra and Courtney.
330,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,>> I know. >> So then me and Courtney
331,00:19:25.12,00:19:25.12,"are looking like, ""Okay, so then we'll both have to compete in"
332,00:19:27.46,00:19:27.46,the immunity challenge. That's a big mistake.
333,00:19:29.88,00:19:29.88,">> Yeah, I said the same thing, but it was Coach."
334,00:19:33.46,00:19:33.46,"You said, ""I really want pizza."""
335,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,"And I said, ""We don't need pizza."
336,00:19:36.83,00:19:36.83,We need an immunity. >> We need to eat
337,00:19:38.50,00:19:38.50,and we need to win. Sandra and Courtney.
338,00:19:40.42,00:19:40.42,Why are you blaming me and Courtney?
339,00:19:42.21,00:19:42.21,>> I'm not blaming you and Courtney.
340,00:19:43.38,00:19:43.38,>> Why? We didn't even do anything.
341,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,">> All I'm saying is that if even once, you guys"
342,00:19:46.92,00:19:46.92,"were like, ""Hell, yeah, ""put me in there!"
343,00:19:48.75,00:19:48.75,"I want to go."" >> So, in essence,"
344,00:19:50.33,00:19:50.33,the reason we lost today was because he and Courtney sat out.
345,00:19:53.25,00:19:53.25,">> Again, no, that's not what it has to do with, again."
346,00:19:55.92,00:19:55.92,">> I just don't understand. The minute we get back to camp,"
347,00:19:58.12,00:19:58.12,"and you guys don't have a meal, all of a sudden, it's me"
348,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,and Courtney. The worst tribe ever put
349,00:20:03.17,00:20:03.17,together is the Villains tribe. I should not even be here.
350,00:20:06.96,00:20:06.96,I should be with the Heroes 'cause I can't stand Jerri.
351,00:20:10.96,00:20:10.96,"I hate Coach, I hate Danielle. I hate Russell even more."
352,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,So any of those-- I'm not going to pick one above
353,00:20:18.17,00:20:18.17,the other 'cause I equally hate them all.
354,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,">> Tyson's gone, Rob's gone, and now we're the"
355,00:20:27.29,00:20:27.29,ones on the outs. And it's 5-2.
356,00:20:34.29,00:20:34.29,Russell's the kind of person where if he finds out
357,00:20:36.62,00:20:36.62,"somebody's gunning for him, he'll take them out."
358,00:20:40.00,00:20:40.00,"if one of us is going next.. I'll be like, ""Hey, Russell."
359,00:20:48.67,00:20:48.67,"Coach wants you gone."" And I bet you Russell"
360,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"will believe me and get rid of Coach, and me and"
361,00:20:54.17,00:20:54.17,Courtney will be saved again. I'm going to work
362,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,my magic and we're both going to be here on day 22 and day 23.
363,00:21:20.38,00:21:20.38,I didn't want to play this game without Tyson.
364,00:21:22.79,00:21:22.79,I didn't want to play this game without Boston Rob.
365,00:21:25.12,00:21:25.12,And it's like all that's out the window.
366,00:21:27.17,00:21:27.17,">> I guess that maybe you feel guilty or something,"
367,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,but I know I'm the next one to go.
368,00:21:32.38,00:21:32.38,"And what else is there to say, you know?"
369,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,It's based on Russell's idea of what he wants
370,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,"his Survivor to be like, and everyone's going along with it"
371,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,"out of, like, fear or something. >> Yeah."
372,00:21:58.79,00:21:58.79,>> Oh. >> But it don't
373,00:22:00.58,00:22:00.58,matter what she says. I will tell them
374,00:22:03.75,00:22:03.75,this is how we're voting. And that's how it's going to be.
375,00:22:08.25,00:22:08.25,"That simple. >> But at the same time, I heard"
376,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,Coach was saying that he made a mistake and he wished he could
377,00:22:14.92,00:22:14.92,go back. >> What mistake?
378,00:22:17.00,00:22:17.00,>> Him letting Rob go home. That he should have never made
379,00:22:20.67,00:22:20.67,"the choice that he made, and that he's sorry."
380,00:22:23.00,00:22:23.00,That's what he told her. And that he wanted to get rid
381,00:22:25.71,00:22:25.71,"of you. So, I don't know about"
382,00:22:28.21,00:22:28.21,"your homeboy. >> Oh, he ain't my homeboy."
383,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,"I don't trust him. Obviously, you can't trust him."
384,00:22:33.83,00:22:33.83,"Because of that right there. He's going behind my back,"
385,00:22:37.21,00:22:37.21,"saying stuff like that. You know... you know, he's..."
386,00:22:40.08,00:22:40.08,"he's digging his own grave, just like Rob did."
387,00:22:43.67,00:22:43.67,">> I told Russell that Coach was talking about voting for him,"
388,00:22:47.21,00:22:47.21,"and Russell's so stupid, he ate that crap up."
389,00:22:50.29,00:22:50.29,"I'm telling you, he's like, ""Oh, my God, I can't trust him."""
390,00:22:52.79,00:22:52.79,"And the sooner he goes, the better."
391,00:22:55.04,00:22:55.04,"So, Russell, you don't know how to play this game."
392,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,"Yeah, he's done good so far, but with me, he don't know what"
393,00:23:01.88,00:23:01.88,he got himself into. >> He's going to flip.
394,00:23:08.54,00:23:08.54,"He's mad at me for getting rid of Rob, and now he's trying to"
395,00:23:11.62,00:23:11.62,stab me in the back. >> Who does he think he is?
396,00:23:14.50,00:23:14.50,>> And you know the beautiful thing about all this?
397,00:23:17.12,00:23:17.12,"If he goes, there's one guy left, and there's no doubt in"
398,00:23:20.25,00:23:20.25,their minds what's going on. >> That there's a girl alliance.
399,00:23:23.21,00:23:23.21,">> Once we merge, they ain't going to talk to one of"
400,00:23:25.17,00:23:25.17,the girls. They're going to be scared to
401,00:23:27.00,00:23:27.00,"death to, but they're surely going to come straight to me."
402,00:23:29.04,00:23:29.04,>> Perfect. >> Perfect.
403,00:23:31.50,00:23:31.50,>> It's all falling together perfectly.
404,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,Mmm. >> You've done that before.
405,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,"(laughter) >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
406,00:24:07.21,00:24:07.21,">> PROBST: All right, you guys ready to get to today's"
407,00:24:09.42,00:24:09.42,"immunity challenge? >> Oh, yeah."
408,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,>> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first.
409,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,Rupert? Take back immunity.
410,00:24:17.96,00:24:17.96,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
411,00:24:21.67,00:24:21.67,"For today's challenge, you will be belted together in pairs."
412,00:24:25.29,00:24:25.29,"You'll race through the mud, going under and over a series of"
413,00:24:29.50,00:24:29.50,obstacles to retrieve a flag. You'll then race back.
414,00:24:32.88,00:24:32.88,First pair back with their flag scores a point for their tribe.
415,00:24:36.08,00:24:36.08,"First tribe to score two points wins immunity, is safe once"
416,00:24:41.08,00:24:41.08,"again from Tribal Council. Losers, you know what's"
417,00:24:43.54,00:24:43.54,happening. Somebody voted out of
418,00:24:45.71,00:24:45.71,"your tribe. Because we have odd numbers, one"
419,00:24:48.04,00:24:48.04,of the matchups will be a one-on-one showdown.
420,00:24:50.92,00:24:50.92,"Villains, you have two extra members."
421,00:24:52.88,00:24:52.88,Courtney and Sandra sat out last time.
422,00:24:54.54,00:24:54.54,That means you are in this time. Who's going to sit out for
423,00:24:57.08,00:24:57.08,the Villains? >> Why don't you and Danielle
424,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,sit out and I'll play. >> PROBST: Jerri and Danielle
425,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,sitting out. All right.
426,00:25:03.08,00:25:03.08,"Sit-outs, take a spot over here. Everybody else, I'll give you a"
427,00:25:05.33,00:25:05.33,minute to strategize. We'll get started.
428,00:25:11.04,00:25:11.04,"All right, we have our first matchup."
429,00:25:13.17,00:25:13.17,It's Russell and Sandra taking on Amanda and Candice.
430,00:25:16.92,00:25:16.92,For immunity. Survivors ready?
431,00:25:19.08,00:25:19.08,">> Here we go. Here we go, team."
432,00:25:20.62,00:25:20.62,">> PROBST: Go! >> Come on, Amanda!"
433,00:25:22.75,00:25:22.75,"Let's go, Candice! >> PROBST: Amanda and Candice"
434,00:25:24.21,00:25:24.21,under the obstacle first. Russell and Sandra right behind.
435,00:25:28.17,00:25:28.17,Sandra slow through that first obstacle.
436,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,"Carrying a lot of mud, you weigh a lot more."
437,00:25:33.75,00:25:33.75,Amanda and Candice over for the Heroes.
438,00:25:36.46,00:25:36.46,We're neck and neck at the second obstacle.
439,00:25:40.04,00:25:40.04,">> Down, down! >> Dig, dig, dig!"
440,00:25:44.04,00:25:44.04,">> Grab, grab, grab! >> Let's go, let's go!"
441,00:25:48.04,00:25:48.04,>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice have the flag for the Heroes.
442,00:25:50.46,00:25:50.46,Russell and Sandra very slow under that third obstacle.
443,00:25:55.00,00:25:55.00,"Sandra really struggling. >> Come on, Sandra!"
444,00:25:59.71,00:25:59.71,>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice taking their time.
445,00:26:02.17,00:26:02.17,No rush at all. You can see the look on
446,00:26:04.25,00:26:04.25,Russell's face. It says it all-- absolute
447,00:26:07.17,00:26:07.17,frustration-- as Amanda and Candice continue further down
448,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,on the course. >> Beautiful.
449,00:26:16.25,00:26:16.25,>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice score for the Heroes.
450,00:26:20.08,00:26:20.08,Sandra is stuck. Trying to back out of that
451,00:26:24.83,00:26:24.83,challenge now. Heroes lead one-zip.
452,00:26:28.42,00:26:28.42,Time for a showdown. Coach taking on Rupert
453,00:26:32.08,00:26:32.08,one-on-one. Survivors ready?
454,00:26:36.08,00:26:36.08,"Go! >> Go, Dragon Slayer!"
455,00:26:39.12,00:26:39.12,">> Go, Rupe! >> PROBST: Both men go"
456,00:26:43.21,00:26:43.21,head first. Coach is out of the gate first
457,00:26:45.42,00:26:45.42,for the Villains. Coach over the second obstacle
458,00:26:48.54,00:26:48.54,first for the Villains. Coach flying through
459,00:26:51.50,00:26:51.50,"this course. >> That a way, Rupe!"
460,00:26:54.12,00:26:54.12,>> PROBST: Rupert right on his tail.
461,00:26:56.08,00:26:56.08,Rupert now picks up some ground. Both men have their flags.
462,00:27:02.25,00:27:02.25,Rupert now in the lead for the Heroes.
463,00:27:08.92,00:27:08.92,Rupert flies over that second obstacle.
464,00:27:12.17,00:27:12.17,It's Rupert and Coach neck and neck.
465,00:27:14.67,00:27:14.67,It's going to be a race to the finish.
466,00:27:19.62,00:27:19.62,Coach wins for the Villains! We are tied one-one.
467,00:27:25.42,00:27:25.42,"All right, here we go. The final round."
468,00:27:28.71,00:27:28.71,Parvati and Courtney taking on J.T. and Colby.
469,00:27:31.21,00:27:31.21,For immunity. Survivors ready?
470,00:27:33.54,00:27:33.54,"Go! >> Come on, you guys."
471,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,"Let's go, Courtney. J.T. and Colby dive head first."
472,00:27:38.42,00:27:38.42,Parvati and Courtney very slow under that first obstacle.
473,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,">> Come on, you guys. You guys, you got it!"
474,00:27:44.38,00:27:44.38,">> Courtney, let's go! Pick it up, girls!"
475,00:27:46.08,00:27:46.08,Let's go! >> PROBST: Courtney and Parvati
476,00:27:47.79,00:27:47.79,falling behind. J.T. and Colby head first again.
477,00:27:51.12,00:27:51.12,">> Come on, you guys! You got it!"
478,00:27:53.71,00:27:53.71,>> PROBST: J.T. and Colby have the flag.
479,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,They're heading back. Parvati and Courtney are not
480,00:27:59.83,00:27:59.83,even at their flag yet. Heroes are almost at the
481,00:28:04.00,00:28:04.00,end now. This is not even close.
482,00:28:12.96,00:28:12.96,J.T. and Colby score for the Heroes.
483,00:28:16.46,00:28:16.46,Heroes win immunity! (cheering)
484,00:28:20.12,00:28:20.12,>> Yeah! Nice work!
485,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: You all right,"
486,00:28:30.04,00:28:30.04,Courtney? >> She hurt her ankle.
487,00:28:34.54,00:28:34.54,>> PROBST: See if you can make it on your own.
488,00:28:36.71,00:28:36.71,"If not, we'll get medical in there."
489,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,"Heroes, congratulations once again."
490,00:28:47.38,00:28:47.38,No Tribal Council for the Heroes.
491,00:28:50.00,00:28:50.00,"The new five stays intact. Villains, four straight"
492,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,challenges in a row. Another trip to Tribal Council.
493,00:28:56.17,00:28:56.17,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
494,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,I'll see you tonight at Tribal. >> I want Courtney gone.
495,00:29:02.25,00:29:02.25,I am a competitor. I hate losing.
496,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,This is not fair to keep people in the game that don't have any
497,00:29:08.12,00:29:08.12,physical ability at all. And they're actually making
498,00:29:11.08,00:29:11.08,us lose. >> I'm just going to jump in.
499,00:29:23.25,00:29:23.25,">> Me, too. >> Whoo!"
500,00:29:28.17,00:29:28.17,>> Another day in the dirt. >> What a challenge.
501,00:29:32.42,00:29:32.42,It was the muddiest one yet. You know how I look at it?
502,00:29:36.29,00:29:36.29,"It's like going to a spa. >> Oh, you bruised your"
503,00:29:44.04,00:29:44.04,"shoulder, too, right here. >> Right there."
504,00:29:49.71,00:29:49.71,>> Everybody's down. Everybody's hurting.
505,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,Everybody's nauseous. (inhales deeply)
506,00:29:56.12,00:29:56.12,And the Dragon Slayer is just coming into his own.
507,00:29:58.71,00:29:58.71,"I feel full of energy, and it's time for me to shine."
508,00:30:03.00,00:30:03.00,"Off into the horizon. But, anyways, we're going to"
509,00:30:08.58,00:30:08.58,"Tribal, and part of me says I ought to just get rid of"
510,00:30:11.75,00:30:11.75,Russell tonight. He's knocked out both of my best
511,00:30:15.04,00:30:15.04,friends in this game. But the way we're losing
512,00:30:18.08,00:30:18.08,"challenges, to keep one of the weaker girls and get rid of"
513,00:30:21.42,00:30:21.42,"Russell-- it might be a mistake. So, I guess I'm going to stay"
514,00:30:25.62,00:30:25.62,"with the forced five alliance and vote out Courtney, who is"
515,00:30:28.83,00:30:28.83,the weakest link. (thunder rumbling)
516,00:30:39.54,00:30:39.54,"Any, uh, funny stuff going on? >> Everything's still the same"
517,00:30:43.92,00:30:43.92,as far as I'm concerned. >> Yeah.
518,00:30:46.71,00:30:46.71,">> I get my mind set on one thing, and I do it."
519,00:30:51.96,00:30:51.96,"If I can't trust them, got to get rid of them."
520,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,Coach-- Sandra said he wants me gone now.
521,00:31:01.17,00:31:01.17,I have the power in this game. I send home who I want to
522,00:31:04.12,00:31:04.12,"send home. I've already talked to Parvati,"
523,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,and she's really on board with voting for Coach.
524,00:31:11.92,00:31:11.92,"And Sandra and Courtney, I think they'll put Coach's name down"
525,00:31:15.12,00:31:15.12,"for sure. So the big Coach, the Coach Man,"
526,00:31:19.04,00:31:19.04,"the Dragon Slayer, he's going home tonight."
527,00:31:34.21,00:31:34.21,">> Honestly, if we don't merge, we're screwed."
528,00:31:36.50,00:31:36.50,They're going to... they're just going to... we'll be done.
529,00:31:38.50,00:31:38.50,>> That's what's going to happen anyway.
530,00:31:40.50,00:31:40.50,We're losing every single one anyway.
531,00:31:42.50,00:31:42.50,">> No, we're not. We have a chance if we"
532,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,have Coach. >> Look what we're doing
533,00:31:46.25,00:31:46.25,with Coach. We're getting dominated.
534,00:31:47.50,00:31:47.50,>> Because of Courtney and Sandra.
535,00:31:51.62,00:31:51.62,>> That's a stupid move. I don't know how you're
536,00:31:53.75,00:31:53.75,thinking right now. I don't know how you're playing
537,00:31:55.38,00:31:55.38,the game. We keep Coach and we lose the
538,00:31:57.17,00:31:57.17,"next one, you'll make sure your butt's on the line for that."
539,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,You... you would put your butt on the line...
540,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,>> I'm just saying we have a better shot.
541,00:32:03.00,00:32:03.00,>> I'm not... you are freaking out right now.
542,00:32:05.04,00:32:05.04,Chill out. >> You ain't making any sense.
543,00:32:06.88,00:32:06.88,">> Yes, I am! It's stupid to let him go."
544,00:32:09.29,00:32:09.29,"I don't think it's... >> I just told you, I don't"
545,00:32:11.29,00:32:11.29,agree with it. >> You're not listening to me!
546,00:32:13.29,00:32:13.29,>> I ain't going to ... talk to you no more.
547,00:32:15.29,00:32:15.29,>> I'm ... giving you suggestions.
548,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,>> Just calm down! >> I'm looking at it in
549,00:32:18.38,00:32:18.38,different ways. You're just like...
550,00:32:20.08,00:32:20.08,">> Geez! >> Whatever, Russell."
551,00:32:24.38,00:32:24.38,(groans) I think it's really stupid
552,00:32:28.38,00:32:28.38,to get rid of another strong player.
553,00:32:30.50,00:32:30.50,"I mean, Courtney and Sandra can't do anything in"
554,00:32:32.71,00:32:32.71,the challenge. They've proved that to us a
555,00:32:34.50,00:32:34.50,"million times over. I mean, Courtney was just"
556,00:32:37.25,00:32:37.25,pathetic. And I think we have a shot at
557,00:32:39.58,00:32:39.58,"least with Coach. So, I mean, I threw that out"
558,00:32:43.46,00:32:43.46,"there, and Russell freaked out and screamed at me because he's"
559,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,"just so in control of this game, and everything has to go the"
560,00:32:50.79,00:32:50.79,"way he wants it to go. So, I mean, as of right now, I'm"
561,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,up in the air. I got to really think about what
562,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,I want to do. >> Because she's such a
563,00:33:07.96,00:33:07.96,competitor. You know what I'm saying?
564,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,"She was like, ""I'm done suggesting things."""
565,00:33:13.38,00:33:13.38,So I think she must have suggested something to Russell.
566,00:33:20.46,00:33:20.46,">> If my plan to vote out Coach doesn't work, I think Courtney"
567,00:33:23.75,00:33:23.75,is going home. I put a bug in Russell's ear
568,00:33:26.29,00:33:26.29,that Coach wants to get rid of him.
569,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50,But Russell was talking to Danielle a few minutes ago.
570,00:33:31.58,00:33:31.58,And the conversation-- it looked like it was going back and
571,00:33:34.12,00:33:34.12,forth. So I don't know.
572,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,"All I can do is hope that Coach is going to go home, and that's"
573,00:33:39.08,00:33:39.08,it. >> Do you know where the saw is?
574,00:33:48.12,00:33:48.12,The one that we open coconuts with?
575,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,>> I think Danielle might be right.
576,00:33:56.08,00:33:56.08,We might need to keep him one more time.
577,00:33:58.46,00:33:58.46,"We can always take him out, any time we want."
578,00:34:02.58,00:34:02.58,I think we should vote Courtney. >> It's absurd.
579,00:34:07.00,00:34:07.00,"First, Russell wants to vote off Coach."
580,00:34:09.25,00:34:09.25,"And then, all of a sudden, he wants to vote Courtney."
581,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,Jeez! This tribe cannot get its act
582,00:34:15.00,00:34:15.00,together. That's a problem.
583,00:34:16.67,00:34:16.67,"You know, we can't make a decision as a cohesive unit to"
584,00:34:19.96,00:34:19.96,save our lives. >> We couldn't be no cooler.
585,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,">> Hopefully, we all come together and vote out the"
586,00:34:31.00,00:34:31.00,dragon slayer. But who knows?
587,00:34:33.83,00:34:33.83,"They might still get together and, say, vote off the weakest"
588,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,and target me and vote me out. You never know what's going to
589,00:34:40.12,00:34:40.12,happen between now and when the sun goes down.
590,00:34:58.92,00:34:58.92,>> PROBST: Let's start tonight's Tribal Council by going back
591,00:35:02.54,00:35:02.54,to the last two Tribal Councils. Tyson and Rob-- the result:
592,00:35:06.42,00:35:06.42,four straight losses with no end in sight.
593,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,"Danielle, any second thoughts about voting out Tyson and Rob?"
594,00:35:14.08,00:35:14.08,">> This decision was made. We thought it would be smarter,"
595,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,because they were such big threats.
596,00:35:19.62,00:35:19.62,"So, it is what it is, Jeff. We thought what we did was the"
597,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,right thing to do. >> PROBST: But in a physical
598,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,"challenge, the only person who won a point today was Coach."
599,00:35:28.96,00:35:28.96,>> Ah. >> PROBST: And if given the
600,00:35:30.33,00:35:30.33,"choice of Tyson or Boston Rob over, say, Courtney, I think 99"
601,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,out of 100 people would probably pick Tyson or Boston Rob-- no
602,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,"disrespect. >> Thank you, Jeffrey."
603,00:35:40.58,00:35:40.58,">> PROBST: Courtney, you've sat out a majority of the"
604,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,challenges. >> That's what the team wanted
605,00:35:44.83,00:35:44.83,to do. I don't have a big ego that has
606,00:35:46.71,00:35:46.71,to go and run and play in every single thing.
607,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,"I wasn't a part of the decision to vote out Tyson or Rob, so"
608,00:35:52.92,00:35:52.92,I'm sad that they're both gone. But insulting me is not going
609,00:35:56.33,00:35:56.33,to bring them back. >> PROBST: It's not meant as an
610,00:35:58.21,00:35:58.21,insult. It's meant as just one person's
611,00:36:00.79,00:36:00.79,observation. Boston Rob was dominating.
612,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,>> I agree with you. >> PROBST: But Danielle just
613,00:36:06.54,00:36:06.54,told me that's why you voted him out.
614,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,>> I didn't vote him out of our tribe.
615,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,"The tribe voted him out, because he was not in the dominating"
616,00:36:14.08,00:36:14.08,"alliance. >> PROBST: Coach, what do you"
617,00:36:17.25,00:36:17.25,think the take is on this tribe from the outside looking in?
618,00:36:21.88,00:36:21.88,>> I personally feel like people are probably laughing at
619,00:36:24.79,00:36:24.79,us right now and saying that we deserve it.
620,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,"Like, today, when we were getting ready for the"
621,00:36:28.71,00:36:28.71,"challenge, I was trying to energize people and I was, like,"
622,00:36:30.67,00:36:30.67,"saying, ""All right, come on, guys, let's do it."""
623,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,"And I had comments like, ""Well, I'm gonna do my best."""
624,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,">> PROBST: Courtney, you're not having any of that."
625,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,">> When, you know, it's a reward challenge, it was Coach saying,"
626,00:36:40.79,00:36:40.79,"""Well, I want to eat, so A squad on."""
627,00:36:44.38,00:36:44.38,"And then, ""I don't care about the immunity challenge, 'cause"
628,00:36:46.92,00:36:46.92,"we'll put the two weak people in there."""
629,00:36:48.62,00:36:48.62,"And then, obviously, it will be one of the us going home."
630,00:36:50.75,00:36:50.75,>> So what I hear from you is that the reason why our morale
631,00:36:53.33,00:36:53.33,is down is because of me. Is that what I'm hearing?
632,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,>> PROBST: That's what I heard. >> This is crazy.
633,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"I don't sit there and make unilateral decisions and say,"
634,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,"""By the way, Courtney and Sandra, you guys should sit out"
635,00:37:02.21,00:37:02.21,"every challenge."" I've never said that, because"
636,00:37:04.21,00:37:04.21,"you don't ever sit out every challenge out here, so I would"
637,00:37:06.21,00:37:06.21,never make a foolhardy statement like that.
638,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,"But what we all want as a tribe is for Courtney to say, ""I want"
639,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"to do that 'cause I can beat that challenge."""
640,00:37:14.21,00:37:14.21,">> Thanks, Dad. >> He's a Coach."
641,00:37:16.42,00:37:16.42,That's what he does. He tries to pick people up.
642,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,">> I'm not saying that you don't mean well, it's just the way"
643,00:37:19.92,00:37:19.92,"that... >> Well, it certainly sounds"
644,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,like it when you say that I'm demoralizing the entire tribe.
645,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,"Trust me, I am not the person that is demoralizing this tribe."
646,00:37:27.54,00:37:27.54,"In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with me."
647,00:37:31.38,00:37:31.38,">> PROBST: Parvati, are you at all concerned that there may"
648,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,not be an end to this slide? And if you ever do merge with
649,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,"the other tribe, your chances of winning and getting to the"
650,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,end go down. >> I don't think it's that hard
651,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,to see that we are definitely less athletic than them.
652,00:37:45.62,00:37:45.62,"So if we continue to do these physical challenges, they're"
653,00:37:48.79,00:37:48.79,"going to slaughter us, and we're going to go, one by one, down"
654,00:37:51.92,00:37:51.92,that trail and our torches are going to get put out by you.
655,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,>> PROBST: But we're talking around the thing that anybody
656,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"watching will know to be true, which is, you guys are making"
657,00:38:00.75,00:38:00.75,"decisions based on alliances, the assumption there might be a"
658,00:38:03.12,00:38:03.12,"merge, and whatever else happens down the game."
659,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,">> Of course! I mean, everyone's talking about"
660,00:38:07.75,00:38:07.75,"a merge, and now all of the sudden, there's not going to be"
661,00:38:09.79,00:38:09.79,"a merge. And so it's target the weak, and"
662,00:38:12.71,00:38:12.71,"I'm, like, poster child for weak Survivor."
663,00:38:15.12,00:38:15.12,"But I'm still here over a bunch of strong players, so twisted"
664,00:38:18.67,00:38:18.67,"ankle, skinny chick, whatever, I'm a determined little bitch,"
665,00:38:22.25,00:38:22.25,and I will put up with a lot of crap to get to the end.
666,00:38:24.75,00:38:24.75,You know? >> Fist bump.
667,00:38:27.83,00:38:27.83,">> That's right, girl. (laughs)"
668,00:38:31.04,00:38:31.04,">> PROBST: Russell, how is tonight's vote going to change"
669,00:38:33.62,00:38:33.62,"this tribe? >> Well, I think if you can"
670,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"keep the tribe stronger and keep the trust in place, that's"
671,00:38:41.29,00:38:41.29,what you need to do. And that's what I'm doing
672,00:38:44.12,00:38:44.12,"tonight. >> PROBST: And with that, it is"
673,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"time to vote. Coach, you're up."
674,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,>> You're a freaking lunatic. I'm just glad I don't have to
675,00:39:11.08,00:39:11.08,live with you anymore. Nice feather in your hair.
676,00:39:28.08,00:39:28.08,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
677,00:39:41.21,00:39:41.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
678,00:39:43.38,00:39:43.38,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
679,00:39:45.50,00:39:45.50,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
680,00:39:50.50,00:39:50.50,First vote: Coach. Coach.
681,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,Two votes Coach. Courtney.
682,00:40:02.54,00:40:02.54,"Two votes Coach, one vote Courtney."
683,00:40:08.58,00:40:08.58,"Courtney. That's two votes Coach, two"
684,00:40:11.08,00:40:11.08,votes Courtney. Courtney.
685,00:40:16.54,00:40:16.54,"Three votes Courtney, two votes Coach."
686,00:40:23.50,00:40:23.50,Coach. We're tied.
687,00:40:25.04,00:40:25.04,"That's three votes Coach, three votes Courtney."
688,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,One vote left. Ninth person voted out of
689,00:40:34.42,00:40:34.42,Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains and the first member of our
690,00:40:37.79,00:40:37.79,jury... Coach.
691,00:40:41.54,00:40:41.54,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Good luck, guys."
692,00:40:57.25,00:40:57.25,">> PROBST: Coach, tribe has spoken."
693,00:41:02.25,00:41:02.25,"Time for you to go. Well, after tonight's Tribal"
694,00:41:16.62,00:41:16.62,"Council, it's clear that the problem with trust, as I'm"
695,00:41:19.83,00:41:19.83,"sure Coach would agree, is you don't know it's gone until it's"
696,00:41:23.42,00:41:23.42,too late. Grab your torches.
697,00:41:25.25,00:41:25.25,Head back to camp. Good night.
698,00:41:39.12,00:41:39.12,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
699,00:41:45.38,00:41:45.38,">> PROBST: In 20 seasons, we've seen a lot of dumb moves."
700,00:41:47.46,00:41:47.46,">> I'll dive right now if you take Katie, and I'll give up the"
701,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,million. >> I have two idols.
702,00:41:51.58,00:41:51.58,I guess I should have played them.
703,00:41:53.17,00:41:53.17,>> It's not the idol. >> Why do you say that?
704,00:41:55.08,00:41:55.08,>> It's a ... stick! >> I want to give individual
705,00:41:57.25,00:41:57.25,"immunity to Natalie. >> PROBST: But next time, you"
706,00:41:59.21,00:41:59.21,might see one that tops them all.
707,00:42:00.96,00:42:00.96,">> I get a chance to talk to Russell, I give him the hidden"
708,00:42:02.38,00:42:02.38,immunity idol. >> I never thought that I would
709,00:42:10.54,00:42:10.54,be going out so soon. I had so much that I wanted to
710,00:42:13.21,00:42:13.21,accomplish and so much that I wanted to prove and redeem.
711,00:42:16.83,00:42:16.83,"I'm exhausted, and still in a state of shock."
712,00:42:19.92,00:42:19.92,But I am probably more pissed off than I've been in a number
713,00:42:23.71,00:42:23.71,"of years. And, you know, I really am not a"
714,00:42:25.96,00:42:25.96,"very vindictive person, but I hope they get wiped off the"
715,00:42:28.38,00:42:28.38,face of the map.
