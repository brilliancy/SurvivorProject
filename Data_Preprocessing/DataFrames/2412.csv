652,00:18:44.97,00:18:44.97,TO WIN.
653,00:18:45.43,00:18:45.43,I DON'T THINK ALICIA WILL GET
654,00:18:46.80,00:18:46.80,MANY VOTES.
655,00:18:47.57,00:18:47.57,SHE'S NOT WELL LIKED.
656,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,BUT SHE'S DELUSIONAL ABOUT THAT
657,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,"AND KAT, SHE WOULD BE THE PERSON"
658,00:18:54.77,00:18:54.77,THAT WOULD HAVE A SHOW LIKE HOW
659,00:18:56.47,00:18:56.47,A MILLION DOLLARS RUIN MID-LIFE
660,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,IN A YEAR AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
661,00:18:59.20,00:18:59.20,WHERE SHE SPENT THE MONEY.
662,00:19:00.27,00:19:00.27,MY WHOLE PLOY TO BOTH OF THEM IS
663,00:19:02.33,00:19:02.33,YOU'RE GOING TO KICK MY ASS IN
664,00:19:03.50,00:19:03.50,THE END BUT I WOULD BE REALLY
665,00:19:05.30,00:19:05.30,SURPRISED IF THERE'S ANYBODY
666,00:19:07.17,00:19:07.17,THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT I
667,00:19:08.50,00:19:08.50,WOULD SAY STAKE WITH THEM.
668,00:19:11.33,00:19:11.33,FINAL THREE TALK IS HAPPENING
669,00:19:13.37,00:19:13.37,ALL OVER THE PLACE.
670,00:19:14.03,00:19:14.03,WE HAVE TO DO VIDEOS.
671,00:19:15.40,00:19:15.40,DO IT!
672,00:19:16.33,00:19:16.33,I FEEL LIKE THIS MAY BE MY
673,00:19:18.20,00:19:18.20,BEST OPTION TO GO WITH KAT AND
674,00:19:20.23,00:19:20.23,ALICIA WHO I FEEL LIKE I CAN
675,00:19:21.57,00:19:21.57,BE... THEY WANT TO VOTE OFF
676,00:19:23.00,00:19:23.00,SABRINA BUT I'VE HAD AN ALLIANCE
677,00:19:25.40,00:19:25.40,WITH SABRINA SINCE THE BEGINNING
678,00:19:26.73,00:19:26.73,SO I WOULD BE VOTING OUT SOMEONE
679,00:19:28.10,00:19:28.10,THAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY IN THE TOP
680,00:19:29.53,00:19:29.53,THREE WITH.
681,00:19:30.13,00:19:30.13,BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF I
682,00:19:31.47,00:19:31.47,DON'T THINK I CAN WIN AGAINST
683,00:19:32.70,00:19:32.70,SABRINA THAT WOULD BE STUPID TO
684,00:19:33.87,00:19:33.87,TAKE HER TO THE FINAL THREE WITH
685,00:19:35.47,00:19:35.47,ME.
686,00:19:41.50,00:19:41.50,"DUDE, I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW."
687,00:19:43.53,00:19:43.53,"LIKE, HONESTLY, IF KAT WOULD"
688,00:19:44.63,00:19:44.63,HAVE PICKED ME I WOULD HAVE SAID
689,00:19:46.00,00:19:46.00,"NO, TARZAN'S GOING."
690,00:19:47.20,00:19:47.20,I WOULD HAVE SWITCHED OUT.
691,00:19:48.00,00:19:48.00,NO DOUBT IN MY MIND YOU TWO
692,00:19:49.57,00:19:49.57,SHOULD HAVE WENT.
693,00:19:50.57,00:19:50.57,PERIOD.
694,00:19:50.93,00:19:50.93,"WHAT IT WAS, IT WAS TOTALLY"
695,00:19:52.87,00:19:52.87,SELFISH.
696,00:19:53.03,00:19:53.03,TRUE.
697,00:19:53.43,00:19:53.43,MAYBE IF I BEGGED SHE WOULD
698,00:19:55.07,00:19:55.07,HAVE TAKEN ME.
699,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,NO.
700,00:19:56.70,00:19:56.70,I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE
701,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,TAKEN YOU.
702,00:19:58.40,00:19:58.40,THAT'S HOW SHE IS.
703,00:19:59.37,00:19:59.37,I WOULD HAVE PICKED TARZAN.
704,00:20:00.90,00:20:00.90,THAT'S JUST THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.
705,00:20:04.40,00:20:04.40,BECAUSE THIS MAN NEEDS TO SEE
706,00:20:05.50,00:20:05.50,"HIS WIFE, PERIOD."
707,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,THEN CHRISTINA BECAUSE OF THE
708,00:20:08.40,00:20:08.40,"KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, HER DAD MAY"
709,00:20:09.30,00:20:09.30,HAVE A COUPLE YEARS LEFT.
710,00:20:11.00,00:20:11.00,SO THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.
711,00:20:13.73,00:20:13.73,KAT IS A BRATTY 23-YEAR-OLD WHO
712,00:20:16.37,00:20:16.37,DOESN'T DESERVE TO GO TO THE END.
713,00:20:18.97,00:20:18.97,THIS IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH REASON
714,00:20:20.23,00:20:20.23,TO MAKE ME VOTE OFF KAT.
715,00:20:21.53,00:20:21.53,YEAH.
716,00:20:22.10,00:20:22.10,EASILY.
717,00:20:22.70,00:20:22.70,I THINK SHE'S IN THE FIRING
718,00:20:24.67,00:20:24.67,LINE BUT I THINK SHE'S AT THE
719,00:20:26.97,00:20:26.97,END OF THE FIRING LINE.
720,00:20:28.07,00:20:28.07,"THAT'S UP TO US, THOUGH,"
721,00:20:30.17,00:20:30.17,TARZAN.
722,00:20:30.43,00:20:30.43,WHEN WE WANT HER OFF.
723,00:20:31.00,00:20:31.00,"WHAT IF ME, CHRISTINA,"
724,00:20:33.20,00:20:33.20,"SABRINA, KIM AND YOU WANT KAT"
725,00:20:36.50,00:20:36.50,OUT?
726,00:20:36.93,00:20:36.93,"WELL, IF THAT WERE THE CASE,"
727,00:20:39.40,00:20:39.40,THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE AN
728,00:20:40.70,00:20:40.70,ERROR BECAUSE KAT IS NOT A
729,00:20:43.40,00:20:43.40,THINKER.
730,00:20:43.80,00:20:43.80,I THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE
731,00:20:45.00,00:20:45.00,THINKING WOULD LEAVE HER IN HERE
732,00:20:46.70,00:20:46.70,LONGER KNOWING FULL WELL THAT AT
733,00:20:48.33,00:20:48.33,ANY TIME IS...
734,00:20:49.27,00:20:49.27,IT'S BASICALLY HER SOCIAL
735,00:20:51.47,00:20:51.47,GAME WITH ALL THE GUYS.
736,00:20:52.97,00:20:52.97,THAT...
737,00:20:53.27,00:20:53.27,IS THAT WHAT WORRIES YOU?
738,00:20:54.50,00:20:54.50,THAT WORRIES ME.
739,00:20:55.70,00:20:55.70,"YEAH, ME, TOO."
740,00:20:57.13,00:20:57.13,KAT SCREWED UP NOW THE TARGET
741,00:20:59.00,00:20:59.00,IS ON HER BACK.
742,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37,PLUS I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS
743,00:21:01.20,00:21:01.20,TO GO TO THE END WITH KAT
744,00:21:03.13,00:21:03.13,BECAUSE LAST TRIBAL TROY
745,00:21:04.83,00:21:04.83,"WHISPERED IN HER EAR ""YOU CAN DO"
746,00:21:06.97,00:21:06.97,IT.
747,00:21:07.40,00:21:07.40,"""SO THAT'S MAKING US ALL A"
748,00:21:09.20,00:21:09.20,LITTLE NERVOUS.
749,00:21:10.50,00:21:10.50,NERVOUS.
750,00:21:11.13,00:21:11.13,HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET EVERYONE
751,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,TO VOTE KAT?
752,00:21:12.97,00:21:12.97,ALL WE NEED IS FOUR.
753,00:21:14.00,00:21:14.00,I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
754,00:21:15.77,00:21:15.77,TALKING WITH KIM WHEN SHE GETS
755,00:21:17.40,00:21:17.40,BACK.
756,00:21:17.83,00:21:17.83,I JUST HOPE WE AGREE THAT KAT IS
757,00:21:19.43,00:21:19.43,A SMART PERSON TO TAKE OUT NEXT.
758,00:21:37.10,00:21:37.10,WHEN WE GOT BACK HERE THERE
759,00:21:38.60,00:21:38.60,WERE SOME PISSED OFF PEOPLE.
760,00:21:40.13,00:21:40.13,EVERYONE'S WANTING KAT OUT NEXT.
761,00:21:41.50,00:21:41.50,THEY'RE GOING TO WANT SABRINA
762,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,FIRST.
763,00:21:43.87,00:21:43.87,ALICIA AND KAT?
764,00:21:45.23,00:21:45.23,I SPENT THE DAY WITH THESE
765,00:21:46.60,00:21:46.60,TWO AND THEY THINK WE'RE A
766,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,THREAT.
767,00:21:48.50,00:21:48.50,THAT'S HOW DUMB THEY ARE.
768,00:21:51.13,00:21:51.13,SAB IS NOT DUMB.
769,00:21:52.17,00:21:52.17,THEY'RE DUMB.
770,00:21:52.60,00:21:52.60,SO YOU THINK SAB TONIGHT?
771,00:21:56.13,00:21:56.13,I THINK IT'S OUR BEST PLAN.
772,00:21:58.97,00:21:58.97,OKAY.
773,00:21:59.43,00:21:59.43,I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE
774,00:22:00.80,00:22:00.80,END WITH KAT.
775,00:22:02.77,00:22:02.77,I'M THINKING IT'S IMMUNITY
776,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,TODAY AND WE HAVE DECIDED
777,00:22:06.73,00:22:06.73,SABRINA IS GOING HOME FOR SURE.
778,00:22:08.00,00:22:08.00,I DO THINK SHE HAS A GOOD SHOT OF
779,00:22:10.80,00:22:10.80,GETTING A LOT OF JURY VOTES
780,00:22:11.83,00:22:11.83,BECAUSE SHE'S PERSUASIVE.
781,00:22:13.80,00:22:13.80,SO IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHO WINS
782,00:22:15.23,00:22:15.23,BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN AND IF
783,00:22:16.77,00:22:16.77,SOMEBODY WINS IMMUNITY THAT WAS
784,00:22:17.93,00:22:17.93,SUPPOSED TO GO HOME IT'S GOING
785,00:22:19.27,00:22:19.27,TO BE CHAOS.
786,00:22:20.40,00:22:20.40,DID I MISS ANYTHING?
787,00:22:21.57,00:22:21.57,NO.

790,00:22:25.90,00:22:25.90,SABRINA BETTER NOT PULL OUT A
791,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87,SUPERSTAR ACT.
792,00:22:29.30,00:22:29.30,I THINK AT SOME POINT IN THIS

949,00:29:13.33,00:29:13.33,I'M NOT SURE SABRINA SHOULD BE
950,00:29:14.70,00:29:14.70,THE NEXT TO GO.
951,00:29:15.90,00:29:15.90,"I THINK KAT, JUST HER"
952,00:29:17.43,00:29:17.43,SELFISHNESS THROUGHOUT THIS
953,00:29:18.23,00:29:18.23,WHOLE GAME SHE SHOULD BE NEXT SO
954,00:29:20.53,00:29:20.53,THERE'S STILL A LOT OF TALKING
955,00:29:21.80,00:29:21.80,THAT NEEDS TO GO ON.
956,00:29:34.60,00:29:34.60,I COMMEND Y'ALL FOR STAYING
957,00:29:35.87,00:29:35.87,THAT LONG.
958,00:29:36.30,00:29:36.30,THAT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL.
959,00:29:40.10,00:29:40.10,ARE YOU HURTING?
960,00:29:40.93,00:29:40.93,YEAH.
961,00:29:41.70,00:29:41.70,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
962,00:29:44.23,00:29:44.23,KICKING YOUR ASS.
963,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE
964,00:29:47.67,00:29:47.67,CHALLENGE.
965,00:29:48.03,00:29:48.03,"I MEAN, TO LOSE TO SOMEONE WHO'S"
966,00:29:49.57,00:29:49.57,28 YEARS OLD WHO'S SIX YEARS
967,00:29:51.40,00:29:51.40,OLDER THAN ME?
968,00:29:52.77,00:29:52.77,IT'S LIKE HOW EMBARRASSING IS
969,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70,THAT?
970,00:29:55.13,00:29:55.13,"DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE HER"
971,00:29:56.27,00:29:56.27,MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
972,00:29:57.37,00:29:57.37,BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER
973,00:29:59.23,00:29:59.23,GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT HER IN
974,00:30:01.33,00:30:01.33,CHALLENGES.
975,00:30:01.60,00:30:01.60,DID KIM TALK TO YOU TODAY?
976,00:30:02.77,00:30:02.77,NOT YET.
977,00:30:05.70,00:30:05.70,SHE ALREADY KNOWS THAT WE
978,00:30:07.07,00:30:07.07,KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
979,00:30:08.27,00:30:08.27,SABRINA.
980,00:30:09.60,00:30:09.60,OKAY.
981,00:30:10.93,00:30:10.93,D'UH.
982,00:30:11.23,00:30:11.23,I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
983,00:30:13.27,00:30:13.27,SABRINA HAS NO IDEA HER ASS
984,00:30:15.20,00:30:15.20,IS ON THE LINE.
985,00:30:16.03,00:30:16.03,THAT'S WHY A BLIND SIDE IS SO
986,00:30:17.67,00:30:17.67,GREAT.
987,00:30:17.83,00:30:17.83,I AGREE.
988,00:30:18.67,00:30:18.67,IT'S AMAZING HOW WE CONTROL
989,00:30:20.20,00:30:20.20,THE SHOW.
990,00:30:20.93,00:30:20.93,THIS GAME IS OUR GAME.
991,00:30:23.60,00:30:23.60,"OH, MY GOD."
992,00:30:24.97,00:30:24.97,IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE YESTERDAY I
993,00:30:25.90,00:30:25.90,"WAS LIKE, SABRINA?"
994,00:30:27.60,00:30:27.60,YOU'RE GOING HOME.
995,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,"THEN TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, I"
996,00:30:31.47,00:30:31.47,"MEAN, DID YOU SEE SABRINA?"
997,00:30:33.00,00:30:33.00,SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE DONE.
998,00:30:34.10,00:30:34.10,"I MEAN, I COULD BEAT HER."
999,00:30:36.47,00:30:36.47,SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY SABRINA
1000,00:30:38.20,00:30:38.20,NEEDS TO GO.
1001,00:30:40.10,00:30:40.10,"BUT KAT, SHE JUST BROUGHT IT."
1002,00:30:42.47,00:30:42.47,HOME GIRL WAS GIVING IT HER AL
1003,00:30:44.70,00:30:44.70,"AND, LIKE, THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT"
1004,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23,I DO NOT WANT TO GO UP AGAINST
1005,00:30:47.47,00:30:47.47,IF THAT'S HOW SHE'S GOING TO
1006,00:30:48.97,00:30:48.97,PLAY THESE CHALLENGES.
1007,00:30:56.30,00:30:56.30,PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE ON THE
1008,00:30:58.30,00:30:58.30,SAME WAVELENGTH SO WE KEEP
1009,00:30:59.70,00:30:59.70,SABRINA AND WE TAKE OUT KAT?
1010,00:31:01.83,00:31:01.83,NO.
1011,00:31:02.67,00:31:02.67,I WANT AN EASIER WIN.
1012,00:31:04.20,00:31:04.20,I CAN'T KEEP GOING UP AGAINST
1013,00:31:06.70,00:31:06.70,KAT.
1014,00:31:07.07,00:31:07.07,YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
1015,00:31:08.80,00:31:08.80,I DON'T WANT IT TO GET LIKE A
1016,00:31:09.73,00:31:09.73,TROY THING WHERE WE CAN'T GET
1017,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,KAT OUT.
1018,00:31:11.57,00:31:11.57,ALICIA CAME UP TO ME AND SHE
1019,00:31:14.07,00:31:14.07,"SAID ""I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT"
1020,00:31:15.60,00:31:15.60,INTO THIS POSITION BUT KAT HAS
1021,00:31:16.67,00:31:16.67,"TO GO IMMEDIATELY."""
1022,00:31:17.80,00:31:17.80,I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED.
1023,00:31:18.70,00:31:18.70,I SAW SOME BIG LOGS RIGHT
1024,00:31:20.83,00:31:20.83,THERE THERE.
1025,00:31:21.47,00:31:21.47,I'M GOING TO GO IN A SECOND.
1026,00:31:22.97,00:31:22.97,NICE.
1027,00:31:23.13,00:31:23.13,HEY.
1028,00:31:25.83,00:31:25.83,KAT.
1029,00:31:26.47,00:31:26.47,THAT'S THE VOTE?
1030,00:31:27.37,00:31:27.37,I MEAN DID YOU SEE HOW HARD
1031,00:31:29.23,00:31:29.23,SHE WENT ON THAT CHALLENGE?
1032,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,AS MUCH AS YOU THINK SHE
1033,00:31:31.87,00:31:31.87,"CAN'T WIN, SHE CAN."
1034,00:31:33.70,00:31:33.70,I DO THINK KAT HAS A GOOD
1035,00:31:35.30,00:31:35.30,SHOT AT GETTING A LOT OF JURY
1036,00:31:37.00,00:31:37.00,VOTES BECAUSE SHE HASN'T PISSED
1037,00:31:38.37,00:31:38.37,A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF.
1038,00:31:39.73,00:31:39.73,BUT I THINK SABRINA'S A BIGGER
1039,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,THREAT.
1040,00:31:42.30,00:31:42.30,SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO SWAY THE
1041,00:31:43.57,00:31:43.57,JURY AND TOTALLY SCREW ME OVER
1042,00:31:45.47,00:31:45.47,IN THE END.
1043,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,LET'S JUST STOP TALKING.
1044,00:31:48.20,00:31:48.20,THAT'S THE VOTE?
1045,00:31:49.30,00:31:49.30,"OKAY, GOOD."
1046,00:31:49.63,00:31:49.63,I WOULD RATHER SEE SABRINA GO
1047,00:31:51.50,00:31:51.50,FIRST BEFORE WE TAKE KAT OUT.
1048,00:31:53.63,00:31:53.63,SO KAT'S GOING TO VOTE SABRINA
1049,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,AND I THINK TARZAN WOULD BE
1050,00:31:56.87,00:31:56.87,WILLING TO GET RID OF SABRINA.
1051,00:31:59.33,00:31:59.33,SO IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE CHELSEA
1052,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,AND I ARE THE SWING VOTES.
1053,00:32:04.57,00:32:04.57,ALICIA CAME TO ME AND SHE'S
1054,00:32:07.47,00:32:07.47,"REALLY, REALLY WORRIED KAT IS"
1055,00:32:08.50,00:32:08.50,GOING TO WIN.
1056,00:32:09.77,00:32:09.77,NOW SHE WANTS TO TAKE KAT OUT
1057,00:32:11.70,00:32:11.70,NEXT.
1058,00:32:11.87,00:32:11.87,"OH, MY GOD!"
1059,00:32:13.07,00:32:13.07,YEAH.
1060,00:32:13.93,00:32:13.93,"SHE'S LIKE ""SHE'S GONNA WIN."""
1061,00:32:16.10,00:32:16.10,I DON'T KNOW THAT IT BENEFITS
1062,00:32:18.23,00:32:18.23,US.
1063,00:32:18.60,00:32:18.60,I'LL START THINKING ABOUT
1064,00:32:19.70,00:32:19.70,THAT AND THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS
1065,00:32:21.53,00:32:21.53,BECAUSE SAB IS SO SMART.
1066,00:32:23.23,00:32:23.23,ALL OF A SUDDEN ALICIA AN I
1067,00:32:27.07,00:32:27.07,ARE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT KAT
1068,00:32:28.47,00:32:28.47,NEEDS TO GO.
1069,00:32:29.50,00:32:29.50,SHE'S SELFISH AND DOESN'T
1070,00:32:30.47,00:32:30.47,DESERVE TO BE IN THE FINAL
1071,00:32:31.63,00:32:31.63,THREE.
1072,00:32:32.10,00:32:32.10,BUT KIM STILL WANTS TO VOTE OUT
1073,00:32:33.73,00:32:33.73,SABRINA.
1074,00:32:34.20,00:32:34.20,I UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE'S COMING
1075,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,"FROM, BUT I FEEL LIKE SABRINA'S"
1076,00:32:37.33,00:32:37.33,BEEN ON KIM AND I'S SIDE SINCE
1077,00:32:39.67,00:32:39.67,DAY ONE.
1078,00:32:40.10,00:32:40.10,SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT SINCE
1079,00:32:41.80,00:32:41.80,SHE HAS HER MIND-SET ON KAT THAT
1080,00:32:43.67,00:32:43.67,WE SHOULD TAKE HER OUT FIRST?
1081,00:32:44.87,00:32:44.87,"WELL, I WOULD SAY SHE"
1082,00:32:46.37,00:32:46.37,DOESN'T...
1083,00:32:46.70,00:32:46.70,BEFORE SHE CHANGES HER MIND?
1084,00:32:47.80,00:32:47.80,I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE
1085,00:32:49.80,00:32:49.80,THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
1086,00:32:51.97,00:32:51.97,KIM AND I ARE GOING TO AGREE
1087,00:32:54.87,00:32:54.87,100% ON WHAT WHATEVER WE DECIDE
1088,00:32:56.23,00:32:56.23,TO DO BUT I THINK FROM HERE ON
1089,00:32:57.93,00:32:57.93,OUT IT'S GOING TO BE A KAT
1090,00:33:00.20,00:33:00.20,FIGHT.

1092,00:33:05.47,00:33:05.47,I'VE BEEN TOLD KAT.
1093,00:33:06.77,00:33:06.77,I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE
1094,00:33:08.37,00:33:08.37,CASE ANYMORE.
1095,00:33:10.57,00:33:10.57,I STILL HAVE SOME CHOICES FOR
1096,00:33:12.10,00:33:12.10,SURE TONIGHT BUT CHELSEA AND I
1097,00:33:13.60,00:33:13.60,HAVE HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH
1098,00:33:14.87,00:33:14.87,"SABRINA SINCE DAY ONE AND KAT, I"
1099,00:33:16.73,00:33:16.73,THINK SHE LOOKS AT ME LIKE A BIG
1100,00:33:18.80,00:33:18.80,SISTER SO THIS IS NOT A FUN VOTE
1101,00:33:21.50,00:33:21.50,TONIGHT.
1102,00:33:21.90,00:33:21.90,"WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY SMART."
1103,00:33:23.47,00:33:23.47,OKAY.
1104,00:33:23.77,00:33:23.77,ALL RIGHT BOSS LADY.

1107,00:33:28.87,00:33:28.87,TO ME IT'S A GAME-CHANGING
1108,00:33:31.77,00:33:31.77,DECISION.
1109,00:33:32.17,00:33:32.17,I'M ABOUT TO MAKE A CHOICE AND
1110,00:33:33.37,00:33:33.37,IT'S GOING TO BE A BLIND SIDE
1111,00:33:34.53,00:33:34.53,EITHER WAY BUT THIS IS A GAME
1112,00:33:35.80,00:33:35.80,AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KEEP
1113,00:33:37.47,00:33:37.47,EVERYBODY HAPPY AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME.
1114,00:33:37.90,00:33:37.90,IT'S GOING TO GO TO HELL FROM HERE ON OUT.
1115,00:33:58.87,00:33:58.87,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1121,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,WHERE YOU'RE DEVASTATED BECAUSE

1123,00:34:24.70,00:34:24.70,THE REWARD TO THIS WEEK WHERE

1127,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,WHICH MEANS YOU'RE LEAVING THE
1128,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,OTHER FOUR BEHIND.
1129,00:34:33.93,00:34:33.93,IT WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST
1130,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80,THING I'VE EVER HAD TO DO IN MY
1131,00:34:38.53,00:34:38.53,LIFE.
1132,00:34:38.97,00:34:38.97,WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF
1133,00:34:40.47,00:34:40.47,THESE BEAUTIFUL FACES WITH THEIR

1135,00:34:42.90,00:34:42.90,TWO PEOPLE.
1136,00:34:43.53,00:34:43.53,IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AND IT
1137,00:34:45.03,00:34:45.03,DOES HURT MY FEELINGS.
1138,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93,"Jeff: IT HURTS ""YOUR"""
1139,00:34:49.30,00:34:49.30,FEELINGS?
1140,00:34:49.70,00:34:49.70,"YEAH, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO"
1141,00:34:50.73,00:34:50.73,SEE THEIR FACES BE MAD.
1142,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,Jeff: HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO
1143,00:34:54.63,00:34:54.63,UNDERSTAND.
1144,00:34:55.03,00:34:55.03,LAST REWARD CHALLENGE KIM DIDN'T
1145,00:34:56.63,00:34:56.63,PICK YOU.
1146,00:34:57.40,00:34:57.40,FIRST PERSON YOU PICK IS KIM.
1147,00:34:59.43,00:34:59.43,YES.
1148,00:35:00.63,00:35:00.63,STRATEGICALLY I COULD HAVE
1149,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40,PICKED TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT
1150,00:35:03.93,00:35:03.93,AT THAT TIME I WAS THINKING MORE
1151,00:35:06.30,00:35:06.30,LIKE WHO WOULD I HAVE A GREAT
1152,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,TIME WITH NOT THINKING
1153,00:35:10.87,00:35:10.87,STRATEGICALLY.
1154,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,"NOW, THAT'S MY OWN CHOICE."
1155,00:35:12.43,00:35:12.43,"Jeff: SABRINA, DO YOU BUY"
1156,00:35:14.40,00:35:14.40,THAT?
1157,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,THAT KAT WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT
1158,00:35:16.57,00:35:16.57,STRATEGY WHEN SHE PICKED TWO OF
1159,00:35:17.83,00:35:17.83,THE PEOPLE WHO WENT ON THE LAST
1160,00:35:20.13,00:35:20.13,REWARD?
1161,00:35:20.47,00:35:20.47,I DON'T THINK STRATEGY HAD
1162,00:35:21.40,00:35:21.40,ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
1163,00:35:22.97,00:35:22.97,I THINK HONESTLY THE 22-YEAR-OLD
1164,00:35:25.57,00:35:25.57,"LIKE ""I WANT TO HAVE FUN."""
1165,00:35:27.10,00:35:27.10,AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING SHE'S
1166,00:35:28.40,00:35:28.40,GOING TO LOOK BACK AT AND REGRET
1167,00:35:30.50,00:35:30.50,BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE UP HERE
1168,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,WOULD HAVE PICKED TARZAN AND
1169,00:35:33.63,00:35:33.63,CHRISTINA SIMPLY BECAUSE OF
1170,00:35:34.40,00:35:34.40,THEIR LOVED ONES BACK STORY.
1171,00:35:37.40,00:35:37.40,BUT IT'S HER CHOICE.
1172,00:35:39.80,00:35:39.80,Jeff: .
1173,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,"JEFF, AGAIN, I AM 22, I AM A"
1174,00:35:42.80,00:35:42.80,LITTLE NAIVE AND I'M SORRY THAT
1175,00:35:44.13,00:35:44.13,I PICKED PEOPLE THAT OBVIOUSLY
1176,00:35:45.60,00:35:45.60,EVERYONE ELSE DIDN'T AGREE WITH.
1177,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03,"Jeff: CHELSEA, DO YOU BUY"
1178,00:35:48.13,00:35:48.13,THAT KAT IS 22 AND NAIVE OR IS
1179,00:35:50.23,00:35:50.23,THAT A GREAT STRATEGY?
1180,00:35:51.97,00:35:51.97,"IT'S, LIKE, THAT'S HER WAY"
1181,00:35:53.70,00:35:53.70,OUT EVERY TIME SHE SCREWS UP.
1182,00:35:55.10,00:35:55.10,EVERY TIME SOMEONE GETS ON HER
1183,00:35:56.70,00:35:56.70,CASE ABOUT HOW SELFISH SHE IS
1184,00:35:58.40,00:35:58.40,"SHE SAYS ""YEAH, I'M 22, GET OFF"
1185,00:36:00.53,00:36:00.53,MY BACK.
1186,00:36:01.27,00:36:01.27,IT'S LIKE IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN
1187,00:36:02.57,00:36:02.57,TO HER AGE AND 22 IS NOT THAT
1188,00:36:06.03,00:36:06.03,YOUNG.
1189,00:36:06.43,00:36:06.43,IS THIS WHOLE TRIBAL COUNCIL
1190,00:36:07.57,00:36:07.57,ABOUT ME?
1191,00:36:08.63,00:36:08.63,"LIKE, I HAD NO IDEA THIS IS..."
1192,00:36:11.03,00:36:11.03,THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
1193,00:36:13.47,00:36:13.47,"Jeff: TARZAN, YOU'RE AN"
1194,00:36:15.00,00:36:15.00,OLDER MAN WHO'S HAD LIFE
1195,00:36:16.77,00:36:16.77,EXPERIENCE.
1196,00:36:17.10,00:36:17.10,WHERE DO YOU WEIGH IN ON THIS?
1197,00:36:18.30,00:36:18.30,I KNOW SHE WANTED TO HAVE FUN
1198,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,WITH THE GIRLS.
1199,00:36:21.27,00:36:21.27,I'M AN OLD MAN.
1200,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,SHE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT MY
1201,00:36:23.53,00:36:23.53,CIRCUMSTANCE OR ABOUT MY WIFE.
1202,00:36:25.50,00:36:25.50,SHE'S 22.
1203,00:36:26.10,00:36:26.10,AND SO THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T
1204,00:36:27.37,00:36:27.37,HIT HER YET BECAUSE SHE'S TOO
1205,00:36:28.80,00:36:28.80,YOUNG TO HAVE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH
1206,00:36:30.93,00:36:30.93,THINGS IN LIFE.
1207,00:36:31.60,00:36:31.60,SO IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.
1208,00:36:35.73,00:36:35.73,"Jeff: ALICIA, LET'S TALK"
1209,00:36:37.27,00:36:37.27,ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE FOR
1210,00:36:39.07,00:36:39.07,IMMUNITY.
1211,00:36:39.63,00:36:39.63,SABRINA'S FIRST OUT.
1212,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME IS
1213,00:36:42.93,00:36:42.93,THAT GOOD NEWS THAT SHE'S OUT
1214,00:36:44.47,00:36:44.47,EARLY AND NOT SEEN AS THE A
1215,00:36:46.60,00:36:46.60,THREAT?
1216,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,IS IT BAD NEWS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
1217,00:36:48.57,00:36:48.57,"HANG IN THERE, MAN, YOU DON'T"
1218,00:36:50.23,00:36:50.23,DESERVE TO GO TO THE END.
1219,00:36:51.43,00:36:51.43,I WAS SURPRISED SABRINA GOT
1220,00:36:53.03,00:36:53.03,OUT FIRST.
1221,00:36:53.80,00:36:53.80,MY VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR
1222,00:36:55.60,00:36:55.60,"TARZAN, YOU KNOW?"
1223,00:36:55.93,00:36:55.93,(LAUGHS)
1224,00:36:56.70,00:36:56.70,I'M SORRY.
1225,00:37:02.70,00:37:02.70,MAYBE IT'S HER GAME TO NOT SHOW
1226,00:37:04.40,00:37:04.40,HERSELF AS A PHYSICAL THREAT.
1227,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50,Jeff: GO TO THE OTHER END.
1228,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,KAT AND KIM DUKE IT OUT TO THE
1229,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,END.
1230,00:37:10.43,00:37:10.43,"I EXPECT THAT FROM KIM, SHE"
1231,00:37:11.70,00:37:11.70,BRINGS IT.
1232,00:37:12.67,00:37:12.67,CAT I WAS VERY SHOCKED.
1233,00:37:13.83,00:37:13.83,I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE HAD IT IN
1234,00:37:16.03,00:37:16.03,HER.
1235,00:37:16.47,00:37:16.47,Jeff: DOES KAT EARN RESPECT
1236,00:37:17.37,00:37:17.37,FOR HANGING IN THE CHALLENGE
1237,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,THAT LONG?
1238,00:37:19.10,00:37:19.10,DEFINITELY.
1239,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,HOWEVER I WAS A LITTLE BAFFLED
1240,00:37:24.57,00:37:24.57,HOW SHE REACTED BECAUSE SHE WAS
1241,00:37:26.37,00:37:26.37,SO UPSET WITH KIM.
1242,00:37:27.93,00:37:27.93,Jeff: I WASN'T UPSET WITH
1243,00:37:29.37,00:37:29.37,"KIM, I WAS UPSET WITH MYSELF"
1244,00:37:30.47,00:37:30.47,THAT MY BAD I DO GAVE OUT.
1245,00:37:32.23,00:37:32.23,KIM WENT TO GIVE YOU A HIGH
1246,00:37:33.77,00:37:33.77,FIVE AND YOU KIND OF SNUFFED
1247,00:37:35.60,00:37:35.60,HERE.
1248,00:37:35.87,00:37:35.87,"DUDE, WHAT IS THIS?"
1249,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,"Jeff: SABRINA, WHAT'S THE"
1250,00:37:39.07,00:37:39.07,VIBE AROUND CAMP?
1251,00:37:39.97,00:37:39.97,YOU PRETTY MUCH DECIMATED THE
1252,00:37:42.73,00:37:42.73,GUYS.
1253,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,NOW WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO IT.
1254,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43,IT'S GETTING A LITTLE TESTY.
1255,00:37:47.13,00:37:47.13,BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I
1256,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,APPRECIATE HONESTY.
1257,00:37:50.10,00:37:50.10,TO ME THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE GET
1258,00:37:53.93,00:37:53.93,RESPECT.
1259,00:37:54.27,00:37:54.27,"Jeff: KIM, DO YOU THINK"
1260,00:37:55.53,00:37:55.53,BEING TOO HONEST IF YOU GET TO
1261,00:37:56.80,00:37:56.80,THE END CAN BE AN ASSET AND
1262,00:37:58.50,00:37:58.50,THEREFORE MAKE YOU A THREAT?
1263,00:37:59.63,00:37:59.63,YEAH.
1264,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"I MEAN, TO ME IT'S BAD NEWS."
1265,00:38:02.33,00:38:02.33,I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WIN THIS GAME
1266,00:38:03.70,00:38:03.70,THAT SHOOT STRAIGHT AND

1268,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,LIKE AN ENDEARING QUALITY IN
1269,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,THIS GAME WHICH ALSO MAKES ME
1270,00:38:10.40,00:38:10.40,NERVOUS.

1276,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PEOPLE
1277,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,VALUE.
1278,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,"LIKE, TO BE HONEST, I WILL GO"
1279,00:38:20.40,00:38:20.40,STRAIGHT UP MY EMOTIONS.
1280,00:38:22.33,00:38:22.33,SO THE PERSON THAT MAY HAVE
