6,00:00:16.83,00:00:16.83,>> PROBST: But focus soon turnedback to the game.
7,00:00:19.27,00:00:19.27,">> I'll tell you, Paschal is ourstrongest adversary."
8,00:00:22.80,00:00:22.80,>> PROBST: Where old bonds wereas strong as ever.
9,00:00:25.20,00:00:25.20,">> It's now Rob's turn to getchopped, but Paschal and Neleh,"
10,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,that unit needs to be severed.>> PROBST: Vecepia won the

13,00:00:36.67,00:00:36.67,"Council, Rob was voted out.General, the tribe has spoken."
14,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,Five are left.Who will be voted out tonight?
15,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,">> Oh!>> Oh, yeah, now that's a fire."
16,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,>> Guys.>> What?
17,00:02:11.73,00:02:11.73,">> He's hungry.>> Oh, we're going to go get"
18,00:02:15.20,00:02:15.20,"some apples.>> I want some real food, man."
19,00:02:18.57,00:02:18.57,">> I know.>> This sucks, man, these days,"
20,00:02:21.90,00:02:21.90,they're not going as fast as youthink.
21,00:02:23.90,00:02:23.90,"At this point, people just wantto eat, get through another day,"
22,00:02:27.27,00:02:27.27,"count them down, win someimmunities and then see where"
23,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,"the cards lay.The next few days, depending on"
24,00:02:32.70,00:02:32.70,"the immunities with five people,I can give you ten different"
25,00:02:36.30,00:02:36.30,"combinations of what couldhappen, and I'm not going to sit"
26,00:02:39.70,00:02:39.70,here and do that because thattakes too much energy to
27,00:02:42.50,00:02:42.50,"strategize.At this point, like I told V,"
28,00:02:45.03,00:02:45.03,just one day at a time.I'm just tired of strategizing
29,00:02:48.17,00:02:48.17,"and even thinking, but I'm goingto go out fighting."
30,00:02:50.90,00:02:50.90,>> The perception was alwaysthat Kathy was being cool
31,00:02:54.17,00:02:54.17,"because people were continuouslylinking Sean and I, and then"
32,00:02:57.90,00:02:57.90,"linking Paschal and Neleh.And so... and then obviously,"
33,00:03:01.73,00:03:01.73,"Kathy being the fifth personsaying, ""Well, who's going to"
34,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,"get her to sway their way?""But I truly do not believe race"
35,00:03:08.63,00:03:08.63,"is an issue on this beach.With the subsequent swing vote,"
36,00:03:11.60,00:03:11.60,"they're going to look at thesetwo African Americans,"
37,00:03:14.20,00:03:14.20,"regardless of what we talkabout, they're going to say"
38,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,"""Okay, those two are intogether, you know, they may"
39,00:03:19.33,00:03:19.33,"vote the same, or whatever.The two African-Americans, these"
40,00:03:22.57,00:03:22.57,"two are close and you're rightin the middle."""
41,00:03:25.23,00:03:25.23,>> They made mention that I amdefinitely a swing vote.
42,00:03:28.43,00:03:28.43,"It's going to look big, playingthe race card of it."
43,00:03:31.40,00:03:31.40,I actually hadn't thought aboutthat until V said that.
44,00:03:34.60,00:03:34.60,">> Then, to be on that side,with Pap and Neleh, and hearing"
45,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,"them saying, you know, ""We'renot going to vote for one"
46,00:03:40.57,00:03:40.57,"another."">> To come out here and be stuck"
47,00:03:42.73,00:03:42.73,on an island with five peoplewho are talking and
48,00:03:45.27,00:03:45.27,"backstabbing, that's reallytough."
49,00:03:47.03,00:03:47.03,"V took Kathy aside and had herlittle discussion with her, and"
50,00:03:50.23,00:03:50.23,you know the whole race thingjust is... is just ridiculous.
51,00:03:53.57,00:03:53.57,It's never ever played a part inthis game.
52,00:03:56.10,00:03:56.10,"Every once in a while they'lljust throw in something like,"
53,00:03:59.00,00:03:59.00,"""It's us two African Americansagainst you two, and then Kathy"
54,00:04:03.37,00:04:03.37,"is a swing vote.""That made me really irritated."
55,00:04:06.20,00:04:06.20,"It's almost like a guilt thing,you know."
56,00:04:08.37,00:04:08.37,>> It's like you owe themsomething.
57,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,>> I know.>> That just gives me more
58,00:04:12.60,00:04:12.60,resolve.I bet Kathy feels like an
59,00:04:14.53,00:04:14.53,absolute fool to even be askedto consider something like that.
60,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30,If V is coming to Kathy andsuggesting to Kathy that this is
61,00:04:23.07,00:04:23.07,"a race thing, right here at theend, I think V is really foolish"
62,00:04:27.10,00:04:27.10,to believe that Kathy is goingto allow herself to be put in
63,00:04:29.73,00:04:29.73,"that spot.I mean, that's just sickening."
64,00:04:35.87,00:04:35.87,>> Just Sean's attitudeseriously is just like dragging
65,00:04:39.30,00:04:39.30,me down.He just complains like all the
66,00:04:41.73,00:04:41.73,time.>> There's absolutely no reason
67,00:04:43.80,00:04:43.80,"from day one to believe eitherone of them, never."
68,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,>> I would absolutely be pukingsick if you and V and Sean are
69,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,at the end.I would just throw up.
70,00:04:55.70,00:04:55.70,>> I don't want to be cast likethe swing player that made the
71,00:04:58.87,00:04:58.87,wrong swing move.Every minute I'm trying to
72,00:05:01.30,00:05:01.30,figure out this game and thebest way to play it.
73,00:05:04.10,00:05:04.10,I'm still looking out formyself.
74,00:05:07.40,00:05:07.40,">> Oh, no!We have to do stilts again."
75,00:05:13.77,00:05:13.77,">> Shoot.>> ""Balance, aim and cunning,"
76,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50,"You've done it all before.Capitalize on past mistakes,"
77,00:05:21.27,00:05:21.27,"come for a weight behind thedoor."""
78,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60,">> Well, we got tree mail thatwas written on a pair of stilts,"
79,00:05:27.73,00:05:27.73,and it basically said that wehad done whatever we're going to
80,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,"do before, whatever that means.It might not have anything to do"
81,00:05:34.83,00:05:34.83,"with stilts.>> Oh, yes, it does."
82,00:05:36.33,00:05:36.33,">> Well, if it does, I'm out.I can never figure them out, so"
83,00:05:39.23,00:05:39.23,"I'll just wait and see.When Jeff tells us, that's when"
84,00:05:41.77,00:05:41.77,"I'll know.>> PROBST: All right, guys."
85,00:05:54.90,00:05:54.90,"You've been out here 34 days,covered a lot of ground,"
86,00:05:58.27,00:05:58.27,"experienced a lot of things,hopefully with very few regrets."
87,00:06:01.67,00:06:01.67,But I know there's one or twochallenges you wouldn't mind
88,00:06:04.60,00:06:04.60,getting another shot at.Today's reward challenge
89,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,combines elements of sixprevious challenges.
90,00:06:10.70,00:06:10.70,You'll begin by assembling atiki.
91,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20,You each will have a color-codedtiki that's been chopped into
92,00:06:15.03,00:06:15.03,eight pieces.The pieces have been spread out
93,00:06:17.30,00:06:17.30,"into the jungle.Find all eight pieces, bring it"
94,00:06:19.53,00:06:19.53,"back, assemble it correctly.Move to the next stage."
95,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,You'll find a pile of coconutsand a bamboo chute.
96,00:06:24.83,00:06:24.83,Break coconuts until your bamboochute is overflowing with
97,00:06:28.53,00:06:28.53,coconut juice.Continue through the jungle.
98,00:06:31.03,00:06:31.03,You'll find stilts hanging inthe air tied to a log.
99,00:06:34.13,00:06:34.13,"Undo the knots, releasing thestilts."
100,00:06:36.33,00:06:36.33,Take the stilts with you to thefourth stage: The stilt-walking
101,00:06:40.13,00:06:40.13,portion of the challenge.It's a ten-foot section.
102,00:06:43.13,00:06:43.13,You must complete it before youcan move on.
103,00:06:45.33,00:06:45.33,"Once you're done with thestilts, you'll come to another"
104,00:06:48.20,00:06:48.20,pile of coconuts.Inside one of these coconuts is
105,00:06:50.67,00:06:50.67,"a key.Use that key to unlock the box,"
106,00:06:52.60,00:06:52.60,you will find a slingshot.That brings you to the final
107,00:06:55.40,00:06:55.40,stage of the competition.Take your slingshot and your
108,00:06:58.37,00:06:58.37,colored rocks and break the tileover your tiki.
109,00:07:01.23,00:07:01.23,First person to fracture theirown tile and get sand on their
110,00:07:05.20,00:07:05.20,own tiki wins reward.I know how tiring 34 days is.
111,00:07:09.00,00:07:09.00,I hope you find the rewardworthy of a very long challenge.
112,00:07:14.93,00:07:14.93,"Bring it down, guys.It's a Saturn Vue, all-wheel"
113,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,"drive SUV.Fully loaded, got all the"

116,00:07:31.47,00:07:31.47,Take your spots.Let's go.
117,00:07:33.90,00:07:33.90,Here we go.Survivors ready?!
118,00:07:36.83,00:07:36.83,Go!V's getting it.
119,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,"There you go, Neleh.You're still in this."
120,00:08:13.80,00:08:13.80,"V's almost there.Sean and Neleh, tikis are taking"
121,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,"shape.That's it, V."
122,00:08:26.33,00:08:26.33,"You're moving on.Neleh, you just about have it."
123,00:08:41.57,00:08:41.57,"Sean, you're getting closer,too."
124,00:08:49.33,00:08:49.33,"Neleh, you got it.You can move on."
125,00:08:56.50,00:08:56.50,">> I don't have it, right?>> PROBST: Not quite, Kathy."
126,00:08:59.03,00:08:59.03,"Keep trying.Sean, that's it."
127,00:09:00.87,00:09:00.87,You can move on.Way to go Kathy.
128,00:09:08.87,00:09:08.87,You got it.Move on.
129,00:09:10.47,00:09:10.47,">> Good going, Kathy.>> PROBST: You're still in this,"
130,00:09:17.33,00:09:17.33,Kathy.V's got about half.
131,00:09:22.77,00:09:22.77,"Neleh, you got about half.Sean's got about two thirds."
132,00:09:26.07,00:09:26.07,Kathy working for her first.This might do it for Sean.
133,00:09:30.17,00:09:30.17,Closer.A little more.
134,00:09:32.40,00:09:32.40,That's it.You're done.
135,00:09:59.03,00:09:59.03,"Get the last knot.Heads up, stilts coming down."
136,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,Nobody close.Let's see if you can do what you
137,00:10:19.83,00:10:19.83,couldn't do a few weeks ago:walk on stilts.
138,00:10:22.27,00:10:22.27,Cross this line and you're good.Look at that!
139,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,You're good!Find the key.
140,00:10:37.40,00:10:37.40,It's as good as yours.Nobody close.
141,00:10:51.63,00:10:51.63,>> Yes!God is so good!
142,00:10:57.57,00:10:57.57,"I can do all things throughChrist, baby."
143,00:10:59.30,00:10:59.30,I can do all things throughChrist!
144,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,Jesus Christ!>> PROBST: Nobody even close.
145,00:11:08.83,00:11:08.83,"You know what?You may not look good, but"
146,00:11:10.93,00:11:10.93,you're going to look good inthat ride.
147,00:11:12.93,00:11:12.93,"Nice work.>> Give me some love, brother."
148,00:11:17.13,00:11:17.13,"You got the reward!>> Go, Sean!"
149,00:11:25.50,00:11:25.50,">> It's beautiful.It's automatic, too."
150,00:11:31.13,00:11:31.13,"Wow.>> Yeah, you look great!"
151,00:11:34.90,00:11:34.90,>> Is that the temperature?>> Temperature outside.
152,00:11:37.57,00:11:37.57,"(honking horn)>> Fantastic, Sean."
153,00:12:02.93,00:12:02.93,"That was so great.>> Boy, your students are going"
154,00:12:06.00,00:12:06.00,to be proud of you.>> I can't believe it.
155,00:12:08.30,00:12:08.30,I just can't believe it.The car is great.
156,00:12:10.60,00:12:10.60,It's a new car with no carpayments.
157,00:12:14.40,00:12:14.40,"I'm blessed, man.I can't ask for anything better."
158,00:12:16.60,00:12:16.60,"I mean, the car is, you know,it's beautiful."
159,00:12:19.10,00:12:19.10,"First of all, it was winning andovercoming the feeling of being"
160,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,"fatigued and tired.>> I'm proud of you, brother."
161,00:12:24.90,00:12:24.90,Came up in here running things.>> All those kids in the inner
162,00:12:28.47,00:12:28.47,"city, for everybody who feelslike they can look at me and"
163,00:12:31.57,00:12:31.57,"feel represented, this was forthem."
164,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,"It's funny when you play thisgame, you don't realize that you"
165,00:12:42.50,00:12:42.50,get emotionally attached tofolks.
166,00:12:44.33,00:12:44.33,"Before you know it, you're like,""damn."""
167,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,>> I'll tell you something elseyou don't realize when you set
168,00:12:49.40,00:12:49.40,"off, and that's at my age...how difficult it is for somebody"
169,00:12:54.60,00:12:54.60,"my age.Physically, I'm a wreck."
170,00:12:57.53,00:12:57.53,I felt like I was quite capableof dealing with anything that
171,00:13:01.00,00:13:01.00,"was thrown my way, but the lasttwo or three days have been a"
172,00:13:04.43,00:13:04.43,"real struggle for all of us.You know, we don't get any"
173,00:13:07.23,00:13:07.23,protein.We're not getting much
174,00:13:08.57,00:13:08.57,carbohydrates.We're not getting much of
175,00:13:10.33,00:13:10.33,anything.Our bodies have just been taking
176,00:13:12.67,00:13:12.67,a pounding and it's reallybeginning to take an effect on
177,00:13:16.00,00:13:16.00,me.I need to go up to the waterfall
178,00:13:17.93,00:13:17.93,and get some water.I may wait and do it in the
179,00:13:21.70,00:13:21.70,morning.I can barely get up.
180,00:13:23.57,00:13:23.57,"When I get up, I have to standup next to a tree and close my"
181,00:13:26.80,00:13:26.80,eyes because I'm so dizzy.>> We're not really all in our

185,00:13:41.70,00:13:41.70,doing challenge after challengeand dealing with mental games
186,00:13:45.07,00:13:45.07,and people lying to you andsleeping in dirt.
187,00:13:47.57,00:13:47.57,You get to a point where youdon't know which way is up.
188,00:13:50.83,00:13:50.83,But I think Pappy-- he's morelethargic and tired than
189,00:13:53.77,00:13:53.77,"anybody.>> Every time when I get up,"
190,00:13:55.83,00:13:55.83,"I get so, so dizzy.>> Same here."
191,00:13:57.67,00:13:57.67,>> I sit up against a tree for asecond.
192,00:13:59.33,00:13:59.33,>> What's that from?Is that dehydration?
193,00:14:01.03,00:14:01.03,Let's drink some water.>> I don't know.
194,00:14:02.80,00:14:02.80,I've been drinking lots of waterand all day yesterday I was in a
195,00:14:05.97,00:14:05.97,"complete fog.I mean, I couldn't see things"
196,00:14:07.97,00:14:07.97,clearly.>> Same here.
197,00:14:08.93,00:14:08.93,"Not only am I depletedphysically, but I'm depleted"
198,00:14:11.23,00:14:11.23,"mentally, and that's why Paschalright now is cashing out."
199,00:14:13.87,00:14:13.87,He's just hibernating.He's not going to do any major
200,00:14:16.80,00:14:16.80,twists and turns because it'sjust too much.
201,00:14:24.70,00:14:24.70,>> We have to go out and gettroca.
202,00:14:26.53,00:14:26.53,"Just in the next hour, the tideis the lowest, it's the easiest"
203,00:14:29.87,00:14:29.87,to get them.>> I'll go with you.
204,00:14:31.37,00:14:31.37,">> I just need some help.>> Everybody, if everybody goes"
205,00:14:33.73,00:14:33.73,"and just gets four or five,we'll be okay."
206,00:14:35.50,00:14:35.50,It's much quicker.>> Yeah.
207,00:14:47.13,00:14:47.13,>> Finding troca is more thanjust troca.
208,00:14:49.97,00:14:49.97,It is beautiful to get away fromthis beach and in that serene
209,00:14:52.77,00:14:52.77,South Pacific waters.It's warm.
210,00:14:54.67,00:14:54.67,It's like a bathtub.But I'm trying to bring people
211,00:14:57.73,00:14:57.73,out there to teach them; to goout there are get that troca.
212,00:15:00.30,00:15:00.30,Because I don't want to be thesole provider and work and work
213,00:15:03.87,00:15:03.87,and work.It's tiring.
214,00:15:05.13,00:15:05.13,">> My first troca.>> All right, man!"
215,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,"I'm telling you, it's like anEaster egg hunt."
216,00:15:11.97,00:15:11.97,Sean's out here with his firsttroca discovery.
217,00:15:15.87,00:15:15.87,"It's taken a lot to get him outhere, I'm a little disappointed,"
218,00:15:18.57,00:15:18.57,"but he's a city kid.So, I'm glad I finally got him"
219,00:15:21.50,00:15:21.50,out here.>> I caught my first troca
220,00:15:23.23,00:15:23.23,"today.You know, they hang onto the"
221,00:15:24.70,00:15:24.70,rocks.They like suction.
222,00:15:25.67,00:15:25.67,"You just got to pull them off,but the only thing is the rocks"
223,00:15:28.43,00:15:28.43,"are slippery as you're walking,and you know, I'm not a ocean"
224,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57,guy and there's black-tippedsharks out here and all kinds of
225,00:15:34.93,00:15:34.93,sea urchins.So you got to be careful.
226,00:15:36.93,00:15:36.93,"So, I got about five or ten.You know, that's pretty good for"
227,00:15:40.10,00:15:40.10,"a brother from uptown, you know.>> Today I just noticed that"
228,00:15:48.07,00:15:48.07,"Paschal was a little downthroughout the day, and he said"
229,00:15:51.03,00:15:51.03,that he felt that people werethinking that him and Neleh have
230,00:15:54.27,00:15:54.27,"some type of agreement, youknow, outside of the five of us"
231,00:15:57.37,00:15:57.37,making an agreement.So I said I think it's best to
232,00:16:00.43,00:16:00.43,clear the air.I don't want you looming with
233,00:16:02.97,00:16:02.97,"some concerns that we're tryingto do something, coming together"
234,00:16:07.03,00:16:07.03,that... to get you guys.>> My attitude is: May the best
235,00:16:11.60,00:16:11.60,"man win.Out of this five, whoever wins"
236,00:16:13.80,00:16:13.80,is very deserving.I've got no problems with that.
237,00:16:16.50,00:16:16.50,>> Why don't we address thattonight again?
238,00:16:18.70,00:16:18.70,"I mean, I don't know if anyoneneeds reassuring, but maybe some"
239,00:16:22.50,00:16:22.50,people do.>> That would be nice just to
240,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,"say, you know, say how we feel.>> Tonight, at some point, we'll"
241,00:16:27.33,00:16:27.33,all sit down.We'll allow Paschal to clear the
242,00:16:29.43,00:16:29.43,air.It's best to try to get as much
243,00:16:31.13,00:16:31.13,of it out in the open as we canthan to sit here and have it
244,00:16:34.37,00:16:34.37,linger.I'd hate for all of us go to bed
245,00:16:36.50,00:16:36.50,still feeling uncomfortable.Let's just go ahead and open up
246,00:16:54.10,00:16:54.10,"this conversation.I know Pappy, I saw you earlier"
247,00:16:56.80,00:16:56.80,"today, and you had been lookingpretty down all day, and I"
248,00:16:59.80,00:16:59.80,"finally took the opportunity toask you, you know, what was"
249,00:17:02.97,00:17:02.97,wrong.And you addressed some concerns.
250,00:17:05.07,00:17:05.07,"And since we're all here, youcan just go ahead and address"
251,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,"it.>> Well, my concern was that I"
252,00:17:10.70,00:17:10.70,felt like that you and Seanthought that Neleh and I had
253,00:17:15.87,00:17:15.87,entered some type of pact tovote solid on everything.
254,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10,And I've said from day one thatI wouldn't vote against Neleh
255,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,"and that's my word, if it costsme in the end, so be it, but"
256,00:17:25.47,00:17:25.47,that's my word.>> I didn't know that.
257,00:17:27.40,00:17:27.40,"I know you guy had a bond and afriendship, but I honestly"
258,00:17:30.37,00:17:30.37,didn't know you were not goingto vote each other out.
259,00:17:33.03,00:17:33.03,"We're talking numbers, okay?We're at five."
260,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,All right.But you guys are really one.
261,00:17:38.10,00:17:38.10,>> I'm not trying to justifyanything.
262,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,"I mean, if you all want to dosomething based on the fact that"
263,00:17:44.20,00:17:44.20,"we're honest with you, go forit."
264,00:17:46.27,00:17:46.27,">> And the thing is, too, isthat I feel that Sean and V have"
265,00:17:49.33,00:17:49.33,"a very, very tight bond.And I think if it came down to"
266,00:17:52.17,00:17:52.17,"it, they're going to sticktogether."
267,00:17:54.07,00:17:54.07,"You know, they've been togetheruntil the end."
268,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,"They've got a really tight bond,and maybe that's just something"
269,00:17:59.43,00:17:59.43,"that's like not coming out orsomething, you know."
270,00:18:01.70,00:18:01.70,Like I have no idea.>> I respect that.
271,00:18:04.97,00:18:04.97,>> I'm just saying...>> Don't use me and V as a
272,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,scapegoat.You came out of your mouth and
273,00:18:11.33,00:18:11.33,"said, ""I'm not voting for Pap.Pappy is not voting for me."""
274,00:18:14.23,00:18:14.23,Don't assume that V and I...>> I'm just saying...
275,00:18:16.23,00:18:16.23,>> But you're assuming ifthere's something underneath.
276,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,We're all being truthful.I already told you V and I had
277,00:18:21.13,00:18:21.13,our differences and we stillhave our differences.
278,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,"So don't sit there and say, ""Ithink people are not saying"
279,00:18:26.27,00:18:26.27,"stuff"" because that's aninsult."
280,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,>> I'm just saying...>> I'm reading between the
281,00:18:29.70,00:18:29.70,lines.>> Sean.
282,00:18:30.27,00:18:30.27,"It's very clear that Sean and Vare very, very tight together,"
283,00:18:33.10,00:18:33.10,whether they want to call italliance.
284,00:18:35.00,00:18:35.00,I think the only difference isthat Paschal and I have been
285,00:18:38.07,00:18:38.07,"honest about saying, up front,you know, we formed a great"
286,00:18:41.13,00:18:41.13,relationship.Sean and V are kind of skipping
287,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"around the table saying, ""Yeah,we have a strong relationship,"
288,00:18:46.13,00:18:46.13,but it doesn't necessarily meanthat they won't vote each other
289,00:18:48.97,00:18:48.97,"out."">> From day one myself and V"
290,00:18:50.90,00:18:50.90,never had a pact.Although some people thought
291,00:18:53.33,00:18:53.33,"""Okay, there's the black couple.They're definitely..."""
292,00:18:56.03,00:18:56.03,">> You know, we haven't walkedaround saying, ""We're the two"
293,00:18:59.10,00:18:59.10,"African Americans.We're sticking together."""
294,00:19:01.43,00:19:01.43,>> By no means is there a Vand Sean connection that's going
295,00:19:04.83,00:19:04.83,to download or whatever.I felt like the conversation was
296,00:19:09.27,00:19:09.27,sidetracked when Neleh tried tointerject that there's something
297,00:19:12.87,00:19:12.87,"going on with V and myself, andI had to tell her just because V"
298,00:19:16.23,00:19:16.23,"and I are African Americans, weshare a bond that you won't"
299,00:19:19.13,00:19:19.13,really be able to understand.Does that mean we're an
300,00:19:22.13,00:19:22.13,automatic alliance?No.
301,00:19:23.63,00:19:23.63,Because a few times V hasslipped the script on me and let
302,00:19:26.37,00:19:26.37,me down.>> The most important thing out
303,00:19:28.27,00:19:28.27,of all this is honesty andintegrity.
304,00:19:30.03,00:19:30.03,>> I agree.>> I think the bottom line is
305,00:19:33.43,00:19:33.43,"there's a little alliance.You know, there's a small one:"
306,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,you guys made a pact.I'm not saying it's wrong.
307,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,I'm just saying it throws askewin how we progress.
308,00:19:46.47,00:19:46.47,That's all.♪ ♪
309,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,>> It all depends on Kathybecause I know V and Sean will
310,00:20:09.80,00:20:09.80,vote for me-- 100% positive.>> I'm not worried about it.
311,00:20:15.43,00:20:15.43,">> Oh, I'm not worried about it.You know, last night was pretty"
312,00:20:17.87,00:20:17.87,intense at the fire.Everybody had a lot to say.
313,00:20:19.70,00:20:19.70,"Things got pretty hyped, and I'mdefinitely feeling vulnerable."
314,00:20:22.53,00:20:22.53,"I just hope Kathy, you know,doesn't fall for what Sean and V"
315,00:20:28.20,00:20:28.20,are kind of playing out on thetable.
316,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,>> I'm totally confused.>> You shouldn't be confused.
317,00:20:34.53,00:20:34.53,"This thing is so plain to me,it's sickening."
318,00:20:39.23,00:20:39.23,">> Well, then fill me in, willyou."
319,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,">> I will, as best I can.I mean, this is my perspective."
320,00:20:44.03,00:20:44.03,"I wouldn't ask you to change athing that's in your heart,"
321,00:20:46.77,00:20:46.77,but this is just something thatjust hit me like a ton of bricks
322,00:20:50.63,00:20:50.63,"last night.Geez, these guys are, have"
323,00:20:53.87,00:20:53.87,"planned from day one.On the other side, I mean, both"
324,00:20:57.63,00:20:57.63,"sides have said the same thing,and we've been duped by V and"
325,00:21:00.93,00:21:00.93,Sean.They've duped everybody else on
326,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,the other side and they've dupedpeople on this side.
327,00:21:06.13,00:21:06.13,">> Yeah.>> Both Vecepia and Sean,"
328,00:21:07.70,00:21:07.70,"they've been just basicallyskating for 33 days, and not"
329,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,really contributing their partuntil right here at the end.
330,00:21:14.63,00:21:14.63,"We got that from the people theywere with at the other camp,"
331,00:21:17.40,00:21:17.40,plus we were told the same thingwhen we got back here about the
332,00:21:20.10,00:21:20.10,other members of the tribe thatwas here.
333,00:21:21.83,00:21:21.83,"Plus, the conversation that wehad last night around the fire"
334,00:21:25.57,00:21:25.57,"really got heated, and Sean, youknow, he got quite emotional,"
335,00:21:29.10,00:21:29.10,"quite loud, and that just turnedus all off."
336,00:21:31.33,00:21:31.33,It's not my desire to changeyour opinion.
337,00:21:33.57,00:21:33.57,It's just my desire to say whatI think is going on and what's
338,00:21:37.20,00:21:37.20,been going on.>> I just don't see that.
339,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,"Damn.>> Well, believe me."
340,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,It's cultural.>> It's what?
341,00:21:45.70,00:21:45.70,I'm so naive.>> It runs deep.
342,00:21:48.07,00:21:48.07,">> I know it does.>> V and Sean, they're trying to"
343,00:21:51.20,00:21:51.20,make Kathy feel like she's aswing vote.
344,00:21:53.67,00:21:53.67,"I mean, they've got an agenda,and I don't give a damn about"
345,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,their agenda.I'm just kind of fed up about
346,00:21:59.30,00:21:59.30,"hearing their crap about, youknow, them not being an"
347,00:22:02.97,00:22:02.97,alliance.And if you think for one second
348,00:22:05.57,00:22:05.57,"if it came down to Sean, V, andyou..."
349,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93,">> I'm out of here.>> Kathy, you know, she's from"
350,00:22:11.57,00:22:11.57,Vermont.I'm from Georgia.
351,00:22:14.27,00:22:14.27,And Sean's from Harlem.This thing runs deeper than a
352,00:22:18.13,00:22:18.13,"game.I'm not willing to capitulate,"
353,00:22:21.33,00:22:21.33,"and, you know, I'm going to digin-- to heck with them."
354,00:22:24.40,00:22:24.40,"If they're lying and deceivingme, then first opportunity I get"
355,00:22:28.03,00:22:28.03,"to vote one of them off, they'reout of here."
356,00:22:42.27,00:22:42.27,>> Come on!Come on. Come on!
357,00:22:45.07,00:22:45.07,Get it up there.Come on! Come on. Come on!
358,00:22:49.27,00:22:49.27,Come on!Get it up there!
359,00:22:56.67,00:22:56.67,Tensions are way too high.Paschal thinks that Sean and V
360,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,are definitely up to somethingfrom day one.
361,00:23:07.07,00:23:07.07,So I thought I'd fly my kite.And it's too gusty.
362,00:23:10.50,00:23:10.50,It's not consistent wind.I think if I go to the final
363,00:23:18.63,00:23:18.63,"three with Paschal and Neleh, Iwill invariably get voted out."
364,00:23:22.97,00:23:22.97,So I've been trying to figureout how I can get to the final
365,00:23:27.07,00:23:27.07,"two, and I think Sean or V is ananswer."
366,00:23:30.87,00:23:30.87,"And when we do get to the three,the three of us, we just... we"
367,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,have to be fair.>> Definitely.
368,00:23:35.07,00:23:35.07,"Because I'm the odd one out,man, I'm the white girl."
369,00:23:38.27,00:23:38.27,>> Don't say that.>> I'm the white mama.

388,00:24:51.17,00:24:51.17,on your ability to answer aseries of questions from a story
389,00:24:54.10,00:24:54.10,I'm about to tell you.Here's how it will work:
390,00:24:56.43,00:24:56.43,"There are six stations,spread out around the area."
391,00:24:59.27,00:24:59.27,Each station has a questionand two possible answers.
392,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,Only one person is allowed in astation at a time.
393,00:25:06.13,00:25:06.13,"So when you reach a station,take your torch, put it in the"
394,00:25:09.03,00:25:09.03,slot.That means it is occupied
395,00:25:10.53,00:25:10.53,"and nobody can join you.If you answer correctly, you'll"
396,00:25:13.80,00:25:13.80,reach in and you'll pull out atiki.
397,00:25:16.13,00:25:16.13,Attach that to a necklace aroundyour neck and move on.
398,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,"If you answer incorrectly,you'll get a bone, and you must"
399,00:25:22.57,00:25:22.57,go to the firewalk and offeryour bone as a sacrifice before
400,00:25:26.10,00:25:26.10,you can continue.So a wrong answer will cost you
401,00:25:28.93,00:25:28.93,valuable time running to thewalk.
402,00:25:30.87,00:25:30.87,First person to get five out ofsix correctly and cross the
403,00:25:34.43,00:25:34.43,finish line with five tikis winsimmunity.
404,00:25:37.00,00:25:37.00,This is a very important andbeautiful place for the
405,00:25:39.93,00:25:39.93,"Marquesan people, but asbeautiful as this place is,"
406,00:25:42.90,00:25:42.90,it is steeped in a history ofviolence.
407,00:25:45.10,00:25:45.10,"This area, in particular, washome to a legendary warrior,"
408,00:25:49.53,00:25:49.53,"Keikahanui.He was the chief of his tribe,"
409,00:25:52.70,00:25:52.70,and he was feared among allother warriors.
410,00:25:55.37,00:25:55.37,His body was covered inintricate Marquesan tattoos.
411,00:25:58.70,00:25:58.70,"Now, the tattooing processitself was very crude."
412,00:26:03.10,00:26:03.10,"Tattoo comes were usually madefrom human bone, sometimes"
413,00:26:06.93,00:26:06.93,"pearl, and even occasionallyanimal bone."
414,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,The comb was pounded into theflesh using a mallet made of
415,00:26:15.90,00:26:15.90,"iron wood.Very painful, took years."
416,00:26:20.40,00:26:20.40,Keikahanui was feared in battlebecause he always seemed to know
417,00:26:23.83,00:26:23.83,"what his enemy was going to do,and he did this by infiltrating"
418,00:26:27.23,00:26:27.23,the tribes of his rivals andposing as an ordinary tribesman.

420,00:26:33.30,00:26:33.30,planned to make war on his owntribe.
421,00:26:35.00,00:26:35.00,"He didn't want to battle his ownpeople, so he decided to fake an"
422,00:26:37.93,00:26:37.93,injury.He went down to the sea and he
423,00:26:40.13,00:26:40.13,grabbed two sea urchins.He took the guts and he wrapped
424,00:26:43.27,00:26:43.27,"them around his foot with atapa, trying to fake an injury."
425,00:26:46.33,00:26:46.33,The smell was so bad the trickworked.
426,00:26:49.37,00:26:49.37,The rest of the rival tribethought he was incapacitated.
427,00:26:52.23,00:26:52.23,They went off to do war.As soon as they were out of
428,00:26:55.27,00:26:55.27,"sight, he stripped off the twourchins, disguised himself by"
429,00:26:58.83,00:26:58.83,taking his long hair and pullingit up into two buns and then he
430,00:27:01.97,00:27:01.97,"grabbed his favorite weapon ofchoice, the war club, made of"
431,00:27:05.27,00:27:05.27,"iron wood, designed to kill witha blow to the head."
432,00:27:08.17,00:27:08.17,"He knew a shortcut, took offrunning."
433,00:27:11.17,00:27:11.17,"His plan was to ambush the warparty, kill the chief, and then"
434,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,the tribe would feast on thechief.
435,00:27:18.40,00:27:18.40,This cannibalism was a verycommon part of Marquesan life.
436,00:27:22.50,00:27:22.50,"It was believed that if you atethe meat of another warrior, you"
437,00:27:26.23,00:27:26.23,inherited their power.So the fleshiest part of the
438,00:27:29.23,00:27:29.23,"meat was reserved for thewarrior who made the kill, and"
439,00:27:32.57,00:27:32.57,Marquesan chiefs would presideover this ceremony.
440,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,And a mana stone would be placedat the top of the victim's skull
441,00:27:40.23,00:27:40.23,to capture their spirit.Keikahanui's plan worked
442,00:27:43.77,00:27:43.77,perfectly.Victory for Keikahanui.
443,00:27:45.93,00:27:45.93,He feasted on the dead chief andthen he let his hair down and
444,00:27:49.47,00:27:49.47,revealed his true identity tothe defeated tribe.
445,00:27:52.23,00:27:52.23,So with the power of thevanquished chief now in
446,00:27:55.03,00:27:55.03,"Keikahanui, legend has it, heunified the tribes."
447,00:27:57.93,00:27:57.93,That ceremony took place on thisvery spot.
448,00:28:01.03,00:28:01.03,"I'll give you your necklace,grab a torch, and let's do this."

558,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,"her to get her to the top, itwasn't, ""Well, let me talk to"
559,00:36:28.87,00:36:28.87,"V.""It was, ""Well, you can get with"
560,00:36:30.50,00:36:30.50,"me and V, and then we'll havethe numbers."""
561,00:36:32.63,00:36:32.63,"That tells me a lot of whatSean's been doing and thinking,"
562,00:36:35.80,00:36:35.80,"and I think he's disingenuous.>> Jeff, I just wanted to,"
563,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,because it was a remark made tome.
564,00:36:40.47,00:36:40.47,"I want to defend my character.First of all, I don't think it"
565,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,"was disingenuous.What I think is five minute ago,"
566,00:36:47.07,00:36:47.07,I stick to my word.V and I didn't have an
567,00:36:49.97,00:36:49.97,"agreement, so what I put outthere was V could have been"
568,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,Tammy or anybody.What I put out there was a life
569,00:36:56.93,00:36:56.93,"raft to say, ""Yo, hang on,"" andI put it out there."
570,00:36:59.93,00:36:59.93,Me and V didn't have noagreement.
571,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,"We've been the underdog, andit's not like we've had an"
572,00:37:04.03,00:37:04.03,agreement.Like when you're playing cards
573,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,and Monopoly and you make alast-ditch.
574,00:37:07.47,00:37:07.47,It's not disingenuous.I've never broken my word.
575,00:37:09.80,00:37:09.80,I stick to that to this point.I threw something out there.
576,00:37:12.80,00:37:12.80,Either she's going to say yes orno.
577,00:37:14.77,00:37:14.77,"If she says no, then by allmeans, my card has folded, then"
578,00:37:18.07,00:37:18.07,vote me out.Let me go.
579,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,"If she says yes, let's roll thedice."
580,00:37:21.47,00:37:21.47,">> PROBST: So let me just recap.So Sean and V are saying, ""Give"
581,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,"one of us immunity, side withus; we'll go with you."""
582,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,"Paschal and Neleh are saying,""Side with us."
583,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,"We'll go with you.""So that's where it stands."
584,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,Anybody want to add anything?>> Why didn't she know about
585,00:37:36.37,00:37:36.37,their pact a long time ago?>> I assumed it was there.
586,00:37:39.03,00:37:39.03,">> I know you assumed, but youknow..."
587,00:37:40.80,00:37:40.80,">> See, I thought she knew untilthat night at the fire."
588,00:37:43.43,00:37:43.43,>> Nothing was confirmed.>> Wait a second.
589,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,Wait a second.We never hid it from anybody.
590,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,So don't talk about assumptions.>> Yeah.
591,00:37:50.53,00:37:50.53,">> I'm not saying you hid it,but being so close, why wouldn't"
592,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"she know?>> Yeah, but I don't care."
593,00:37:57.37,00:37:57.37,">> She knows now.Well, point the finger at me."
594,00:37:59.73,00:37:59.73,The point is you didn't know twoweeks ago.
595,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,">> Well, I'll point it at you.>> All right, point it at me."
596,00:38:04.43,00:38:04.43,">> The point is, she knows now.She knew today."
597,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"She knows everything.>> No, no, no."
598,00:38:09.77,00:38:09.77,>> If you'd just listen once ina while instead of running your
599,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,mouth all the time.>> I'm listening!
600,00:38:16.20,00:38:16.20,I'm listening!What are you saying?
601,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,>> I'm saying that she knewabout it and we talked about the
602,00:38:21.23,00:38:21.23,"negotiations.>> Please, please."
603,00:38:22.73,00:38:22.73,She did not know.She just told me.
604,00:38:24.37,00:38:24.37,">> Look, this is the deal.>> They ain't going to shush me"
605,00:38:27.17,00:38:27.17,"up.Vote me out, but I'm going to"
606,00:38:28.70,00:38:28.70,speak my mind.She did not know.
607,00:38:30.23,00:38:30.23,"Now, they can play this hanky-panky with everybody and do it"
608,00:38:33.20,00:38:33.20,because I'm always speaking out.Vote me out if that's your
609,00:38:36.23,00:38:36.23,conscience.But you all deal with the BS.
610,00:38:38.43,00:38:38.43,She did not know.You're putting words in my mouth
611,00:38:41.07,00:38:41.07,right now.All right?
612,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,>> But you didn't know abouttheir pact though is all I'm
613,00:38:44.60,00:38:44.60,"saying.>> I didn't hear officially, but"
614,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,it's a logical assumptionbecause they've known each other
615,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,"for so long.>> Come on, man."
616,00:38:51.03,00:38:51.03,"I know I'm young and I mighttalk a whole lot, but some of"
617,00:38:54.27,00:38:54.27,"the stuff I make sense.Damn, I do listen."
618,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"I still got respect for you.But damn it, I'm a man, too, and"
619,00:39:00.07,00:39:00.07,"all I'm saying is none of thisjives up, because if these two"
620,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,"has a pact, that means they'redoing the same thing they're"
621,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,accusing me and V of doing.I'm disingenuous when I do it...
622,00:39:09.53,00:39:09.53,>> Just let it go.>> Okay.
623,00:39:12.20,00:39:12.20,>> Let it go.>> PROBST: All right.
