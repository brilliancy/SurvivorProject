1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.53,00:00:02.53, Survivor: The tribe's spirits were lifted when they got to see
3,00:00:05.73,00:00:05.73,their loved ones at the reward challenge.
4,00:00:07.83,00:00:07.83,">> Way to go, girl! >> PROBST: Kathy's son won, and"
5,00:00:11.53,00:00:11.53,"spent the night at Soliantu. >> Coming out here, it's just"
6,00:00:15.07,00:00:15.07,"like, wow. It's a whole other world."
7,00:00:16.83,00:00:16.83,>> PROBST: But focus soon turned back to the game.
8,00:00:19.27,00:00:19.27,">> I'll tell you, Paschal is our strongest adversary."
9,00:00:22.80,00:00:22.80,>> PROBST: Where old bonds were as strong as ever.
10,00:00:25.20,00:00:25.20,">> It's now Rob's turn to get chopped, but Paschal and Neleh,"
11,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,that unit needs to be severed. >> PROBST: Vecepia won the
12,00:00:32.23,00:00:32.23,"immunity challenge. >> Yeah, baby!"
13,00:00:34.23,00:00:34.23,"Oh, give it to me! >> PROBST: And at Tribal"
14,00:00:36.67,00:00:36.67,"Council, Rob was voted out. General, the tribe has spoken."
15,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,Five are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
16,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,">> Oh! >> Oh, yeah, now that's a fire."
17,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,>> Guys. >> What?
18,00:02:11.73,00:02:11.73,">> He's hungry. >> Oh, we're going to go get"
19,00:02:15.20,00:02:15.20,"some apples. >> I want some real food, man."
20,00:02:18.57,00:02:18.57,">> I know. >> This sucks, man, these days,"
21,00:02:21.90,00:02:21.90,they're not going as fast as you think.
22,00:02:23.90,00:02:23.90,"At this point, people just want to eat, get through another day,"
23,00:02:27.27,00:02:27.27,"count them down, win some immunities and then see where"
24,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,"the cards lay. The next few days, depending on"
25,00:02:32.70,00:02:32.70,"the immunities with five people, I can give you ten different"
26,00:02:36.30,00:02:36.30,"combinations of what could happen, and I'm not going to sit"
27,00:02:39.70,00:02:39.70,here and do that because that takes too much energy to
28,00:02:42.50,00:02:42.50,"strategize. At this point, like I told V,"
29,00:02:45.03,00:02:45.03,just one day at a time. I'm just tired of strategizing
30,00:02:48.17,00:02:48.17,"and even thinking, but I'm going to go out fighting."
31,00:02:50.90,00:02:50.90,>> The perception was always that Kathy was being cool
32,00:02:54.17,00:02:54.17,"because people were continuously linking Sean and I, and then"
33,00:02:57.90,00:02:57.90,"linking Paschal and Neleh. And so... and then obviously,"
34,00:03:01.73,00:03:01.73,"Kathy being the fifth person saying, ""Well, who's going to"
35,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,"get her to sway their way?"" But I truly do not believe race"
36,00:03:08.63,00:03:08.63,"is an issue on this beach. With the subsequent swing vote,"
37,00:03:11.60,00:03:11.60,"they're going to look at these two African Americans,"
38,00:03:14.20,00:03:14.20,"regardless of what we talk about, they're going to say"
39,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,"""Okay, those two are in together, you know, they may"
40,00:03:19.33,00:03:19.33,"vote the same, or whatever. The two African-Americans, these"
41,00:03:22.57,00:03:22.57,"two are close and you're right in the middle."""
42,00:03:25.23,00:03:25.23,>> They made mention that I am definitely a swing vote.
43,00:03:28.43,00:03:28.43,"It's going to look big, playing the race card of it."
44,00:03:31.40,00:03:31.40,I actually hadn't thought about that until V said that.
45,00:03:34.60,00:03:34.60,">> Then, to be on that side, with Pap and Neleh, and hearing"
46,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,"them saying, you know, ""We're not going to vote for one"
47,00:03:40.57,00:03:40.57,"another."" >> To come out here and be stuck"
48,00:03:42.73,00:03:42.73,on an island with five people who are talking and
49,00:03:45.27,00:03:45.27,"backstabbing, that's really tough."
50,00:03:47.03,00:03:47.03,"V took Kathy aside and had her little discussion with her, and"
51,00:03:50.23,00:03:50.23,you know the whole race thing just is... is just ridiculous.
52,00:03:53.57,00:03:53.57,It's never ever played a part in this game.
53,00:03:56.10,00:03:56.10,"Every once in a while they'll just throw in something like,"
54,00:03:59.00,00:03:59.00,"""It's us two African Americans against you two, and then Kathy"
55,00:04:03.37,00:04:03.37,"is a swing vote."" That made me really irritated."
56,00:04:06.20,00:04:06.20,"It's almost like a guilt thing, you know."
57,00:04:08.37,00:04:08.37,>> It's like you owe them something.
58,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,>> I know. >> That just gives me more
59,00:04:12.60,00:04:12.60,resolve. I bet Kathy feels like an
60,00:04:14.53,00:04:14.53,absolute fool to even be asked to consider something like that.
61,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30,If V is coming to Kathy and suggesting to Kathy that this is
62,00:04:23.07,00:04:23.07,"a race thing, right here at the end, I think V is really foolish"
63,00:04:27.10,00:04:27.10,to believe that Kathy is going to allow herself to be put in
64,00:04:29.73,00:04:29.73,"that spot. I mean, that's just sickening."
65,00:04:35.87,00:04:35.87,>> Just Sean's attitude seriously is just like dragging
66,00:04:39.30,00:04:39.30,me down. He just complains like all the
67,00:04:41.73,00:04:41.73,time. >> There's absolutely no reason
68,00:04:43.80,00:04:43.80,"from day one to believe either one of them, never."
69,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,>> I would absolutely be puking sick if you and V and Sean are
70,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,at the end. I would just throw up.
71,00:04:55.70,00:04:55.70,>> I don't want to be cast like the swing player that made the
72,00:04:58.87,00:04:58.87,wrong swing move. Every minute I'm trying to
73,00:05:01.30,00:05:01.30,figure out this game and the best way to play it.
74,00:05:04.10,00:05:04.10,I'm still looking out for myself.
75,00:05:07.40,00:05:07.40,">> Oh, no! We have to do stilts again."
76,00:05:13.77,00:05:13.77,">> Shoot. >> ""Balance, aim and cunning,"
77,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50,"You've done it all before. Capitalize on past mistakes,"
78,00:05:21.27,00:05:21.27,"come for a weight behind the door."""
79,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60,">> Well, we got tree mail that was written on a pair of stilts,"
80,00:05:27.73,00:05:27.73,and it basically said that we had done whatever we're going to
81,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,"do before, whatever that means. It might not have anything to do"
82,00:05:34.83,00:05:34.83,"with stilts. >> Oh, yes, it does."
83,00:05:36.33,00:05:36.33,">> Well, if it does, I'm out. I can never figure them out, so"
84,00:05:39.23,00:05:39.23,"I'll just wait and see. When Jeff tells us, that's when"
85,00:05:41.77,00:05:41.77,"I'll know. >> PROBST: All right, guys."
86,00:05:54.90,00:05:54.90,"You've been out here 34 days, covered a lot of ground,"
87,00:05:58.27,00:05:58.27,"experienced a lot of things, hopefully with very few regrets."
88,00:06:01.67,00:06:01.67,But I know there's one or two challenges you wouldn't mind
89,00:06:04.60,00:06:04.60,getting another shot at. Today's reward challenge
90,00:06:07.57,00:06:07.57,combines elements of six previous challenges.
91,00:06:10.70,00:06:10.70,You'll begin by assembling a tiki.
92,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20,You each will have a color-coded tiki that's been chopped into
93,00:06:15.03,00:06:15.03,eight pieces. The pieces have been spread out
94,00:06:17.30,00:06:17.30,"into the jungle. Find all eight pieces, bring it"
95,00:06:19.53,00:06:19.53,"back, assemble it correctly. Move to the next stage."
96,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,You'll find a pile of coconuts and a bamboo chute.
97,00:06:24.83,00:06:24.83,Break coconuts until your bamboo chute is overflowing with
98,00:06:28.53,00:06:28.53,coconut juice. Continue through the jungle.
99,00:06:31.03,00:06:31.03,You'll find stilts hanging in the air tied to a log.
100,00:06:34.13,00:06:34.13,"Undo the knots, releasing the stilts."
101,00:06:36.33,00:06:36.33,Take the stilts with you to the fourth stage: The stilt-walking
102,00:06:40.13,00:06:40.13,portion of the challenge. It's a ten-foot section.
103,00:06:43.13,00:06:43.13,You must complete it before you can move on.
104,00:06:45.33,00:06:45.33,"Once you're done with the stilts, you'll come to another"
105,00:06:48.20,00:06:48.20,pile of coconuts. Inside one of these coconuts is
106,00:06:50.67,00:06:50.67,"a key. Use that key to unlock the box,"
107,00:06:52.60,00:06:52.60,you will find a slingshot. That brings you to the final
108,00:06:55.40,00:06:55.40,stage of the competition. Take your slingshot and your
109,00:06:58.37,00:06:58.37,colored rocks and break the tile over your tiki.
110,00:07:01.23,00:07:01.23,First person to fracture their own tile and get sand on their
111,00:07:05.20,00:07:05.20,own tiki wins reward. I know how tiring 34 days is.
112,00:07:09.00,00:07:09.00,I hope you find the reward worthy of a very long challenge.
113,00:07:14.93,00:07:14.93,"Bring it down, guys. It's a Saturn Vue, all-wheel"
114,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,"drive SUV. Fully loaded, got all the"
115,00:07:25.23,00:07:25.23,extras. For you to enjoy when you return
116,00:07:29.17,00:07:29.17,"home. All right, guys."
117,00:07:31.47,00:07:31.47,Take your spots. Let's go.
118,00:07:33.90,00:07:33.90,Here we go. Survivors ready?!
119,00:07:36.83,00:07:36.83,Go! V's getting it.
120,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,"There you go, Neleh. You're still in this."
121,00:08:13.80,00:08:13.80,"V's almost there. Sean and Neleh, tikis are taking"
122,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,"shape. That's it, V."
123,00:08:26.33,00:08:26.33,"You're moving on. Neleh, you just about have it."
124,00:08:41.57,00:08:41.57,"Sean, you're getting closer, too."
125,00:08:49.33,00:08:49.33,"Neleh, you got it. You can move on."
126,00:08:56.50,00:08:56.50,">> I don't have it, right? >> PROBST: Not quite, Kathy."
127,00:08:59.03,00:08:59.03,"Keep trying. Sean, that's it."
128,00:09:00.87,00:09:00.87,You can move on. Way to go Kathy.
129,00:09:08.87,00:09:08.87,You got it. Move on.
130,00:09:10.47,00:09:10.47,">> Good going, Kathy. >> PROBST: You're still in this,"
131,00:09:17.33,00:09:17.33,Kathy. V's got about half.
132,00:09:22.77,00:09:22.77,"Neleh, you got about half. Sean's got about two thirds."
133,00:09:26.07,00:09:26.07,Kathy working for her first. This might do it for Sean.
134,00:09:30.17,00:09:30.17,Closer. A little more.
135,00:09:32.40,00:09:32.40,That's it. You're done.
136,00:09:59.03,00:09:59.03,"Get the last knot. Heads up, stilts coming down."
137,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,Nobody close. Let's see if you can do what you
138,00:10:19.83,00:10:19.83,couldn't do a few weeks ago: walk on stilts.
139,00:10:22.27,00:10:22.27,Cross this line and you're good. Look at that!
140,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,You're good! Find the key.
141,00:10:37.40,00:10:37.40,It's as good as yours. Nobody close.
142,00:10:51.63,00:10:51.63,>> Yes! God is so good!
143,00:10:57.57,00:10:57.57,"I can do all things through Christ, baby."
144,00:10:59.30,00:10:59.30,I can do all things through Christ!
145,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,Jesus Christ! >> PROBST: Nobody even close.
146,00:11:08.83,00:11:08.83,"You know what? You may not look good, but"
147,00:11:10.93,00:11:10.93,you're going to look good in that ride.
148,00:11:12.93,00:11:12.93,"Nice work. >> Give me some love, brother."
149,00:11:17.13,00:11:17.13,"You got the reward! >> Go, Sean!"
150,00:11:25.50,00:11:25.50,">> It's beautiful. It's automatic, too."
151,00:11:31.13,00:11:31.13,"Wow. >> Yeah, you look great!"
152,00:11:34.90,00:11:34.90,>> Is that the temperature? >> Temperature outside.
153,00:11:37.57,00:11:37.57,"(honking horn) >> Fantastic, Sean."
154,00:12:02.93,00:12:02.93,"That was so great. >> Boy, your students are going"
155,00:12:06.00,00:12:06.00,to be proud of you. >> I can't believe it.
156,00:12:08.30,00:12:08.30,I just can't believe it. The car is great.
157,00:12:10.60,00:12:10.60,It's a new car with no car payments.
158,00:12:14.40,00:12:14.40,"I'm blessed, man. I can't ask for anything better."
159,00:12:16.60,00:12:16.60,"I mean, the car is, you know, it's beautiful."
160,00:12:19.10,00:12:19.10,"First of all, it was winning and overcoming the feeling of being"
161,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,"fatigued and tired. >> I'm proud of you, brother."
162,00:12:24.90,00:12:24.90,Came up in here running things. >> All those kids in the inner
163,00:12:28.47,00:12:28.47,"city, for everybody who feels like they can look at me and"
164,00:12:31.57,00:12:31.57,"feel represented, this was for them."
165,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,"It's funny when you play this game, you don't realize that you"
166,00:12:42.50,00:12:42.50,get emotionally attached to folks.
167,00:12:44.33,00:12:44.33,"Before you know it, you're like, ""damn."""
168,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,>> I'll tell you something else you don't realize when you set
169,00:12:49.40,00:12:49.40,"off, and that's at my age... how difficult it is for somebody"
170,00:12:54.60,00:12:54.60,"my age. Physically, I'm a wreck."
171,00:12:57.53,00:12:57.53,I felt like I was quite capable of dealing with anything that
172,00:13:01.00,00:13:01.00,"was thrown my way, but the last two or three days have been a"
173,00:13:04.43,00:13:04.43,"real struggle for all of us. You know, we don't get any"
174,00:13:07.23,00:13:07.23,protein. We're not getting much
175,00:13:08.57,00:13:08.57,carbohydrates. We're not getting much of
176,00:13:10.33,00:13:10.33,anything. Our bodies have just been taking
177,00:13:12.67,00:13:12.67,a pounding and it's really beginning to take an effect on
178,00:13:16.00,00:13:16.00,me. I need to go up to the waterfall
179,00:13:17.93,00:13:17.93,and get some water. I may wait and do it in the
180,00:13:21.70,00:13:21.70,morning. I can barely get up.
181,00:13:23.57,00:13:23.57,"When I get up, I have to stand up next to a tree and close my"
182,00:13:26.80,00:13:26.80,eyes because I'm so dizzy. >> We're not really all in our
183,00:13:31.30,00:13:31.30,"right frame of mind right now, you know, we're like holding"
184,00:13:35.17,00:13:35.17,"on, literally. After almost five or six weeks"
185,00:13:38.10,00:13:38.10,"of having diarrhea, having to dig holes to take a crap, after"
186,00:13:41.70,00:13:41.70,doing challenge after challenge and dealing with mental games
187,00:13:45.07,00:13:45.07,and people lying to you and sleeping in dirt.
188,00:13:47.57,00:13:47.57,You get to a point where you don't know which way is up.
189,00:13:50.83,00:13:50.83,But I think Pappy-- he's more lethargic and tired than
190,00:13:53.77,00:13:53.77,"anybody. >> Every time when I get up,"
191,00:13:55.83,00:13:55.83,"I get so, so dizzy. >> Same here."
192,00:13:57.67,00:13:57.67,>> I sit up against a tree for a second.
193,00:13:59.33,00:13:59.33,>> What's that from? Is that dehydration?
194,00:14:01.03,00:14:01.03,Let's drink some water. >> I don't know.
195,00:14:02.80,00:14:02.80,I've been drinking lots of water and all day yesterday I was in a
196,00:14:05.97,00:14:05.97,"complete fog. I mean, I couldn't see things"
197,00:14:07.97,00:14:07.97,clearly. >> Same here.
198,00:14:08.93,00:14:08.93,"Not only am I depleted physically, but I'm depleted"
199,00:14:11.23,00:14:11.23,"mentally, and that's why Paschal right now is cashing out."
200,00:14:13.87,00:14:13.87,He's just hibernating. He's not going to do any major
201,00:14:16.80,00:14:16.80,twists and turns because it's just too much.
202,00:14:24.70,00:14:24.70,>> We have to go out and get troca.
203,00:14:26.53,00:14:26.53,"Just in the next hour, the tide is the lowest, it's the easiest"
204,00:14:29.87,00:14:29.87,to get them. >> I'll go with you.
205,00:14:31.37,00:14:31.37,">> I just need some help. >> Everybody, if everybody goes"
206,00:14:33.73,00:14:33.73,"and just gets four or five, we'll be okay."
207,00:14:35.50,00:14:35.50,It's much quicker. >> Yeah.
208,00:14:47.13,00:14:47.13,>> Finding troca is more than just troca.
209,00:14:49.97,00:14:49.97,It is beautiful to get away from this beach and in that serene
210,00:14:52.77,00:14:52.77,South Pacific waters. It's warm.
211,00:14:54.67,00:14:54.67,It's like a bathtub. But I'm trying to bring people
212,00:14:57.73,00:14:57.73,out there to teach them; to go out there are get that troca.
213,00:15:00.30,00:15:00.30,Because I don't want to be the sole provider and work and work
214,00:15:03.87,00:15:03.87,and work. It's tiring.
215,00:15:05.13,00:15:05.13,">> My first troca. >> All right, man!"
216,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,"I'm telling you, it's like an Easter egg hunt."
217,00:15:11.97,00:15:11.97,Sean's out here with his first troca discovery.
218,00:15:15.87,00:15:15.87,"It's taken a lot to get him out here, I'm a little disappointed,"
219,00:15:18.57,00:15:18.57,"but he's a city kid. So, I'm glad I finally got him"
220,00:15:21.50,00:15:21.50,out here. >> I caught my first troca
221,00:15:23.23,00:15:23.23,"today. You know, they hang onto the"
222,00:15:24.70,00:15:24.70,rocks. They like suction.
223,00:15:25.67,00:15:25.67,"You just got to pull them off, but the only thing is the rocks"
224,00:15:28.43,00:15:28.43,"are slippery as you're walking, and you know, I'm not a ocean"
225,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57,guy and there's black-tipped sharks out here and all kinds of
226,00:15:34.93,00:15:34.93,sea urchins. So you got to be careful.
227,00:15:36.93,00:15:36.93,"So, I got about five or ten. You know, that's pretty good for"
228,00:15:40.10,00:15:40.10,"a brother from uptown, you know. >> Today I just noticed that"
229,00:15:48.07,00:15:48.07,"Paschal was a little down throughout the day, and he said"
230,00:15:51.03,00:15:51.03,that he felt that people were thinking that him and Neleh have
231,00:15:54.27,00:15:54.27,"some type of agreement, you know, outside of the five of us"
232,00:15:57.37,00:15:57.37,making an agreement. So I said I think it's best to
233,00:16:00.43,00:16:00.43,clear the air. I don't want you looming with
234,00:16:02.97,00:16:02.97,"some concerns that we're trying to do something, coming together"
235,00:16:07.03,00:16:07.03,that... to get you guys. >> My attitude is: May the best
236,00:16:11.60,00:16:11.60,"man win. Out of this five, whoever wins"
237,00:16:13.80,00:16:13.80,is very deserving. I've got no problems with that.
238,00:16:16.50,00:16:16.50,>> Why don't we address that tonight again?
239,00:16:18.70,00:16:18.70,"I mean, I don't know if anyone needs reassuring, but maybe some"
240,00:16:22.50,00:16:22.50,people do. >> That would be nice just to
241,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,"say, you know, say how we feel. >> Tonight, at some point, we'll"
242,00:16:27.33,00:16:27.33,all sit down. We'll allow Paschal to clear the
243,00:16:29.43,00:16:29.43,air. It's best to try to get as much
244,00:16:31.13,00:16:31.13,of it out in the open as we can than to sit here and have it
245,00:16:34.37,00:16:34.37,linger. I'd hate for all of us go to bed
246,00:16:36.50,00:16:36.50,still feeling uncomfortable. Let's just go ahead and open up
247,00:16:54.10,00:16:54.10,"this conversation. I know Pappy, I saw you earlier"
248,00:16:56.80,00:16:56.80,"today, and you had been looking pretty down all day, and I"
249,00:16:59.80,00:16:59.80,"finally took the opportunity to ask you, you know, what was"
250,00:17:02.97,00:17:02.97,wrong. And you addressed some concerns.
251,00:17:05.07,00:17:05.07,"And since we're all here, you can just go ahead and address"
252,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,"it. >> Well, my concern was that I"
253,00:17:10.70,00:17:10.70,felt like that you and Sean thought that Neleh and I had
254,00:17:15.87,00:17:15.87,entered some type of pact to vote solid on everything.
255,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10,And I've said from day one that I wouldn't vote against Neleh
256,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,"and that's my word, if it costs me in the end, so be it, but"
257,00:17:25.47,00:17:25.47,that's my word. >> I didn't know that.
258,00:17:27.40,00:17:27.40,"I know you guy had a bond and a friendship, but I honestly"
259,00:17:30.37,00:17:30.37,didn't know you were not going to vote each other out.
260,00:17:33.03,00:17:33.03,"We're talking numbers, okay? We're at five."
261,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,All right. But you guys are really one.
262,00:17:38.10,00:17:38.10,>> I'm not trying to justify anything.
263,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,"I mean, if you all want to do something based on the fact that"
264,00:17:44.20,00:17:44.20,"we're honest with you, go for it."
265,00:17:46.27,00:17:46.27,">> And the thing is, too, is that I feel that Sean and V have"
266,00:17:49.33,00:17:49.33,"a very, very tight bond. And I think if it came down to"
267,00:17:52.17,00:17:52.17,"it, they're going to stick together."
268,00:17:54.07,00:17:54.07,"You know, they've been together until the end."
269,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,"They've got a really tight bond, and maybe that's just something"
270,00:17:59.43,00:17:59.43,"that's like not coming out or something, you know."
271,00:18:01.70,00:18:01.70,Like I have no idea. >> I respect that.
272,00:18:04.97,00:18:04.97,>> I'm just saying... >> Don't use me and V as a
273,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,scapegoat. You came out of your mouth and
274,00:18:11.33,00:18:11.33,"said, ""I'm not voting for Pap. Pappy is not voting for me."""
275,00:18:14.23,00:18:14.23,Don't assume that V and I... >> I'm just saying...
276,00:18:16.23,00:18:16.23,>> But you're assuming if there's something underneath.
277,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,We're all being truthful. I already told you V and I had
278,00:18:21.13,00:18:21.13,our differences and we still have our differences.
279,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,"So don't sit there and say, ""I think people are not saying"
280,00:18:26.27,00:18:26.27,"stuff"" because that's an insult."
281,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,>> I'm just saying... >> I'm reading between the
282,00:18:29.70,00:18:29.70,lines. >> Sean.
283,00:18:30.27,00:18:30.27,"It's very clear that Sean and V are very, very tight together,"
284,00:18:33.10,00:18:33.10,whether they want to call it alliance.
285,00:18:35.00,00:18:35.00,I think the only difference is that Paschal and I have been
286,00:18:38.07,00:18:38.07,"honest about saying, up front, you know, we formed a great"
287,00:18:41.13,00:18:41.13,relationship. Sean and V are kind of skipping
288,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"around the table saying, ""Yeah, we have a strong relationship,"
289,00:18:46.13,00:18:46.13,but it doesn't necessarily mean that they won't vote each other
290,00:18:48.97,00:18:48.97,"out."" >> From day one myself and V"
291,00:18:50.90,00:18:50.90,never had a pact. Although some people thought
292,00:18:53.33,00:18:53.33,"""Okay, there's the black couple. They're definitely..."""
293,00:18:56.03,00:18:56.03,">> You know, we haven't walked around saying, ""We're the two"
294,00:18:59.10,00:18:59.10,"African Americans. We're sticking together."""
295,00:19:01.43,00:19:01.43,>> By no means is there a V and Sean connection that's going
296,00:19:04.83,00:19:04.83,to download or whatever. I felt like the conversation was
297,00:19:09.27,00:19:09.27,sidetracked when Neleh tried to interject that there's something
298,00:19:12.87,00:19:12.87,"going on with V and myself, and I had to tell her just because V"
299,00:19:16.23,00:19:16.23,"and I are African Americans, we share a bond that you won't"
300,00:19:19.13,00:19:19.13,really be able to understand. Does that mean we're an
301,00:19:22.13,00:19:22.13,automatic alliance? No.
302,00:19:23.63,00:19:23.63,Because a few times V has slipped the script on me and let
303,00:19:26.37,00:19:26.37,me down. >> The most important thing out
304,00:19:28.27,00:19:28.27,of all this is honesty and integrity.
305,00:19:30.03,00:19:30.03,>> I agree. >> I think the bottom line is
306,00:19:33.43,00:19:33.43,"there's a little alliance. You know, there's a small one:"
307,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,you guys made a pact. I'm not saying it's wrong.
308,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,I'm just saying it throws askew in how we progress.
309,00:19:46.47,00:19:46.47,That's all. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
310,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,>> It all depends on Kathy because I know V and Sean will
311,00:20:09.80,00:20:09.80,vote for me-- 100% positive. >> I'm not worried about it.
312,00:20:15.43,00:20:15.43,">> Oh, I'm not worried about it. You know, last night was pretty"
313,00:20:17.87,00:20:17.87,intense at the fire. Everybody had a lot to say.
314,00:20:19.70,00:20:19.70,"Things got pretty hyped, and I'm definitely feeling vulnerable."
315,00:20:22.53,00:20:22.53,"I just hope Kathy, you know, doesn't fall for what Sean and V"
316,00:20:28.20,00:20:28.20,are kind of playing out on the table.
317,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,>> I'm totally confused. >> You shouldn't be confused.
318,00:20:34.53,00:20:34.53,"This thing is so plain to me, it's sickening."
319,00:20:39.23,00:20:39.23,">> Well, then fill me in, will you."
320,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,">> I will, as best I can. I mean, this is my perspective."
321,00:20:44.03,00:20:44.03,"I wouldn't ask you to change a thing that's in your heart,"
322,00:20:46.77,00:20:46.77,but this is just something that just hit me like a ton of bricks
323,00:20:50.63,00:20:50.63,"last night. Geez, these guys are, have"
324,00:20:53.87,00:20:53.87,"planned from day one. On the other side, I mean, both"
325,00:20:57.63,00:20:57.63,"sides have said the same thing, and we've been duped by V and"
326,00:21:00.93,00:21:00.93,Sean. They've duped everybody else on
327,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,the other side and they've duped people on this side.
328,00:21:06.13,00:21:06.13,">> Yeah. >> Both Vecepia and Sean,"
329,00:21:07.70,00:21:07.70,"they've been just basically skating for 33 days, and not"
330,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,really contributing their part until right here at the end.
331,00:21:14.63,00:21:14.63,"We got that from the people they were with at the other camp,"
332,00:21:17.40,00:21:17.40,plus we were told the same thing when we got back here about the
333,00:21:20.10,00:21:20.10,other members of the tribe that was here.
334,00:21:21.83,00:21:21.83,"Plus, the conversation that we had last night around the fire"
335,00:21:25.57,00:21:25.57,"really got heated, and Sean, you know, he got quite emotional,"
336,00:21:29.10,00:21:29.10,"quite loud, and that just turned us all off."
337,00:21:31.33,00:21:31.33,It's not my desire to change your opinion.
338,00:21:33.57,00:21:33.57,It's just my desire to say what I think is going on and what's
339,00:21:37.20,00:21:37.20,been going on. >> I just don't see that.
340,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,"Damn. >> Well, believe me."
341,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,It's cultural. >> It's what?
342,00:21:45.70,00:21:45.70,I'm so naive. >> It runs deep.
343,00:21:48.07,00:21:48.07,">> I know it does. >> V and Sean, they're trying to"
344,00:21:51.20,00:21:51.20,make Kathy feel like she's a swing vote.
345,00:21:53.67,00:21:53.67,"I mean, they've got an agenda, and I don't give a damn about"
346,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,their agenda. I'm just kind of fed up about
347,00:21:59.30,00:21:59.30,"hearing their crap about, you know, them not being an"
348,00:22:02.97,00:22:02.97,alliance. And if you think for one second
349,00:22:05.57,00:22:05.57,"if it came down to Sean, V, and you..."
350,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93,">> I'm out of here. >> Kathy, you know, she's from"
351,00:22:11.57,00:22:11.57,Vermont. I'm from Georgia.
352,00:22:14.27,00:22:14.27,And Sean's from Harlem. This thing runs deeper than a
353,00:22:18.13,00:22:18.13,"game. I'm not willing to capitulate,"
354,00:22:21.33,00:22:21.33,"and, you know, I'm going to dig in-- to heck with them."
355,00:22:24.40,00:22:24.40,"If they're lying and deceiving me, then first opportunity I get"
356,00:22:28.03,00:22:28.03,"to vote one of them off, they're out of here."
357,00:22:42.27,00:22:42.27,>> Come on! Come on. Come on!
358,00:22:45.07,00:22:45.07,Get it up there. Come on! Come on. Come on!
359,00:22:49.27,00:22:49.27,Come on! Get it up there!
360,00:22:56.67,00:22:56.67,Tensions are way too high. Paschal thinks that Sean and V
361,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,are definitely up to something from day one.
362,00:23:07.07,00:23:07.07,So I thought I'd fly my kite. And it's too gusty.
363,00:23:10.50,00:23:10.50,It's not consistent wind. I think if I go to the final
364,00:23:18.63,00:23:18.63,"three with Paschal and Neleh, I will invariably get voted out."
365,00:23:22.97,00:23:22.97,So I've been trying to figure out how I can get to the final
366,00:23:27.07,00:23:27.07,"two, and I think Sean or V is an answer."
367,00:23:30.87,00:23:30.87,"And when we do get to the three, the three of us, we just... we"
368,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,have to be fair. >> Definitely.
369,00:23:35.07,00:23:35.07,"Because I'm the odd one out, man, I'm the white girl."
370,00:23:38.27,00:23:38.27,>> Don't say that. >> I'm the white mama.
371,00:23:40.93,00:23:40.93,">> You know, V and I have had... she's switched a few times on"
372,00:23:44.77,00:23:44.77,me... >> I know.
373,00:23:45.73,00:23:45.73,>> ...and people think that our loyalty is brother and sister.
374,00:23:49.60,00:23:49.60,">> When she does, she moves around a little."
375,00:23:51.90,00:23:51.90,">> Just remember that. So, I'll play fair."
376,00:23:54.13,00:23:54.13,>> Yep. >> I think what Kathy is feeling
377,00:23:56.07,00:23:56.07,is what we're saying. She didn't really like the fact
378,00:23:58.53,00:23:58.53,that Pappy and Neleh had that so-called alliance.
379,00:24:00.93,00:24:00.93,So maybe we're leaning towards getting rid of Neleh and Pap.
380,00:24:05.37,00:24:05.37,>> I think both of them won't be big adversaries.
381,00:24:11.20,00:24:11.20,"I really don't. It's a wide-open game, no doubt"
382,00:24:13.57,00:24:13.57,"about it, and I think the immunity challenges are going to"
383,00:24:16.53,00:24:16.53,"really swing it. Because they're not physical,"
384,00:24:20.13,00:24:20.13,"anybody can win. >> PROBST: First things first,"
385,00:24:37.43,00:24:37.43,V. I'll take back the immunity
386,00:24:38.97,00:24:38.97,necklace. Immunity back up for grabs.
387,00:24:44.67,00:24:44.67,Have a seat. All right.
388,00:24:47.73,00:24:47.73,Your success in tonight's immunity challenge will be based
389,00:24:51.17,00:24:51.17,on your ability to answer a series of questions from a story
390,00:24:54.10,00:24:54.10,I'm about to tell you. Here's how it will work:
391,00:24:56.43,00:24:56.43,"There are six stations, spread out around the area."
392,00:24:59.27,00:24:59.27,Each station has a question and two possible answers.
393,00:25:02.67,00:25:02.67,Only one person is allowed in a station at a time.
394,00:25:06.13,00:25:06.13,"So when you reach a station, take your torch, put it in the"
395,00:25:09.03,00:25:09.03,slot. That means it is occupied
396,00:25:10.53,00:25:10.53,"and nobody can join you. If you answer correctly, you'll"
397,00:25:13.80,00:25:13.80,reach in and you'll pull out a tiki.
398,00:25:16.13,00:25:16.13,Attach that to a necklace around your neck and move on.
399,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,"If you answer incorrectly, you'll get a bone, and you must"
400,00:25:22.57,00:25:22.57,go to the firewalk and offer your bone as a sacrifice before
401,00:25:26.10,00:25:26.10,you can continue. So a wrong answer will cost you
402,00:25:28.93,00:25:28.93,valuable time running to the walk.
403,00:25:30.87,00:25:30.87,First person to get five out of six correctly and cross the
404,00:25:34.43,00:25:34.43,finish line with five tikis wins immunity.
405,00:25:37.00,00:25:37.00,This is a very important and beautiful place for the
406,00:25:39.93,00:25:39.93,"Marquesan people, but as beautiful as this place is,"
407,00:25:42.90,00:25:42.90,it is steeped in a history of violence.
408,00:25:45.10,00:25:45.10,"This area, in particular, was home to a legendary warrior,"
409,00:25:49.53,00:25:49.53,"Keikahanui. He was the chief of his tribe,"
410,00:25:52.70,00:25:52.70,and he was feared among all other warriors.
411,00:25:55.37,00:25:55.37,His body was covered in intricate Marquesan tattoos.
412,00:25:58.70,00:25:58.70,"Now, the tattooing process itself was very crude."
413,00:26:03.10,00:26:03.10,"Tattoo comes were usually made from human bone, sometimes"
414,00:26:06.93,00:26:06.93,"pearl, and even occasionally animal bone."
415,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,The comb was pounded into the flesh using a mallet made of
416,00:26:15.90,00:26:15.90,"iron wood. Very painful, took years."
417,00:26:20.40,00:26:20.40,Keikahanui was feared in battle because he always seemed to know
418,00:26:23.83,00:26:23.83,"what his enemy was going to do, and he did this by infiltrating"
419,00:26:27.23,00:26:27.23,the tribes of his rivals and posing as an ordinary tribesman.
420,00:26:30.60,00:26:30.60,"Well, he was living with a rival tribe when he learned they"
421,00:26:33.30,00:26:33.30,planned to make war on his own tribe.
422,00:26:35.00,00:26:35.00,"He didn't want to battle his own people, so he decided to fake an"
423,00:26:37.93,00:26:37.93,injury. He went down to the sea and he
424,00:26:40.13,00:26:40.13,grabbed two sea urchins. He took the guts and he wrapped
425,00:26:43.27,00:26:43.27,"them around his foot with a tapa, trying to fake an injury."
426,00:26:46.33,00:26:46.33,The smell was so bad the trick worked.
427,00:26:49.37,00:26:49.37,The rest of the rival tribe thought he was incapacitated.
428,00:26:52.23,00:26:52.23,They went off to do war. As soon as they were out of
429,00:26:55.27,00:26:55.27,"sight, he stripped off the two urchins, disguised himself by"
430,00:26:58.83,00:26:58.83,taking his long hair and pulling it up into two buns and then he
431,00:27:01.97,00:27:01.97,"grabbed his favorite weapon of choice, the war club, made of"
432,00:27:05.27,00:27:05.27,"iron wood, designed to kill with a blow to the head."
433,00:27:08.17,00:27:08.17,"He knew a shortcut, took off running."
434,00:27:11.17,00:27:11.17,"His plan was to ambush the war party, kill the chief, and then"
435,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,the tribe would feast on the chief.
436,00:27:18.40,00:27:18.40,This cannibalism was a very common part of Marquesan life.
437,00:27:22.50,00:27:22.50,"It was believed that if you ate the meat of another warrior, you"
438,00:27:26.23,00:27:26.23,inherited their power. So the fleshiest part of the
439,00:27:29.23,00:27:29.23,"meat was reserved for the warrior who made the kill, and"
440,00:27:32.57,00:27:32.57,Marquesan chiefs would preside over this ceremony.
441,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,And a mana stone would be placed at the top of the victim's skull
442,00:27:40.23,00:27:40.23,to capture their spirit. Keikahanui's plan worked
443,00:27:43.77,00:27:43.77,perfectly. Victory for Keikahanui.
444,00:27:45.93,00:27:45.93,He feasted on the dead chief and then he let his hair down and
445,00:27:49.47,00:27:49.47,revealed his true identity to the defeated tribe.
446,00:27:52.23,00:27:52.23,So with the power of the vanquished chief now in
447,00:27:55.03,00:27:55.03,"Keikahanui, legend has it, he unified the tribes."
448,00:27:57.93,00:27:57.93,That ceremony took place on this very spot.
449,00:28:01.03,00:28:01.03,"I'll give you your necklace, grab a torch, and let's do this."
450,00:28:05.23,00:28:05.23,This is for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final
451,00:28:08.03,00:28:08.03,four. Survivors ready?!
452,00:28:10.07,00:28:10.07,Go! >> The warrior who made the

472,00:30:22.93,00:30:22.93,>> False. >> PROBST: Let's see the tikis.
473,00:30:40.03,00:30:40.03,">> It's fine, right? >> One fell off."
474,00:30:42.03,00:30:42.03,>> PROBST: You've only got four. You lost a tiki.
475,00:30:44.07,00:30:44.07,"You must have lost one, too. The game is still alive, guys!"
476,00:30:49.60,00:30:49.60,Make sure you hang onto your tikis.
477,00:30:51.57,00:30:51.57,You got to go to a new question if you can't find it.
478,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,You can't go to the same question.
479,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,>> PROBST: Kathy has five tikis! >> Woo!
480,00:31:10.40,00:31:10.40,All right! It's so fun to win this game!
481,00:31:15.97,00:31:15.97,"All right, yes. >> PROBST: Turn around here."
482,00:31:19.57,00:31:19.57,"Add this to your necklace. >> Thanks, you guys."

488,00:32:00.80,00:32:00.80,Paschal and Neleh and I have been together from the get-go.
489,00:32:03.80,00:32:03.80,Paschal and Neleh have already told themselves many moons ago
490,00:32:07.70,00:32:07.70,"that they'll never vote against each other, so that's a dilemma"
491,00:32:10.63,00:32:10.63,"for me. But my other two people, Sean"

494,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,they're both Afro-American and I know that's very important in
495,00:32:24.10,00:32:24.10,"their culture to stick together. So I got Sean and V, and I got"
496,00:32:27.47,00:32:27.47,Paschal and Neleh. I got all these different issues
497,00:32:30.27,00:32:30.27,"weighing back and forth, and I have to make a decision"
498,00:32:33.07,00:32:33.07,which way to go. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

508,00:33:35.80,00:33:35.80,So where are you sitting right now in terms of that?
509,00:33:39.27,00:33:39.27,">> I mean, the layers of it, it's ridiculous."
510,00:33:42.13,00:33:42.13,"The strategy of it is number one, because I would be paired"
511,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,up with Paschal and Neleh or Sean and V.
512,00:33:48.47,00:33:48.47,And to just dissect how I'm going to fall within those two
513,00:33:53.43,00:33:53.43,"pairs is very difficult. >> PROBST: So, the irony is that"

516,00:34:05.43,00:34:05.43,you're wearing this very valuable thing.
517,00:34:07.10,00:34:07.10,Have you thought about utilizing the value of the immunity

519,00:34:14.87,00:34:14.87,up for negotiating if somebody wants to come to me.

522,00:34:22.60,00:34:22.60,>> Very. If it's a game and people are
523,00:34:24.67,00:34:24.67,"playing and they want to win, nobody has come to talk to me."
524,00:34:28.13,00:34:28.13,>> PROBST: Anybody here want to approach Kathy?
525,00:34:31.67,00:34:31.67,>> Me. >> PROBST: What's the deal
526,00:34:33.93,00:34:33.93,"you're offering Kathy? >> You give me immunity, I don't"
527,00:34:37.40,00:34:37.40,"vote for you, and we go to the top."
528,00:34:39.43,00:34:39.43,>> PROBST: You have two. So why is that a good thing for
529,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,Kathy? You're still outnumbered.
530,00:34:44.07,00:34:44.07,>> I don't want to put all my strategy out there.
531,00:34:46.67,00:34:46.67,"I mean, there's some things that are obvious, but I'm telling"
532,00:34:50.20,00:34:50.20,"Kathy, you won't have my vote against you, and you can read"
533,00:34:54.77,00:34:54.77,between the lines all you want with that.
534,00:34:57.23,00:34:57.23,"It's tough, Jeff, because... >> You haven't explained it to"
535,00:35:00.83,00:35:00.83,"me, though. You haven't explained to me..."
536,00:35:02.63,00:35:02.63,"You haven't explained... come to me prior to this, and so I don't"
537,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,understand where your head's at. >> My thinking was this: Because
538,00:35:11.67,00:35:11.67,"these two had an alliance, I thought that maybe Kat would"
539,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53,"want to hook up with me-- this is funny, us getting into this--"
540,00:35:19.23,00:35:19.23,would want to hook up with me and V.
541,00:35:20.80,00:35:20.80,The thing is me and V never had that kind of agreement where you
542,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,"had to feel apprehensive about coming in and saying, ""Here's"
543,00:35:28.47,00:35:28.47,two African Americans. Are they going to now band

547,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,So I can say what I know what I can do.

549,00:35:47.60,00:35:47.60,"I understand what you're saying, Sean, and if this was to happen,"
550,00:35:51.87,00:35:51.87,"if Kathy was to agree to give him the immunity, I would fall"
551,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,in line with that and work as a threesome and have a threesome
552,00:35:58.60,00:35:58.60,agreement. >> Let me just say one thing
553,00:36:01.07,00:36:01.07,here. A lot has been said that by

555,00:36:07.10,00:36:07.10,"position, but in some fashion I find it quite amusing and"
556,00:36:11.23,00:36:11.23,contradictory. Here he's said all night there's
557,00:36:15.27,00:36:15.27,"no association between him and V, and yet when Kathy pressed"
558,00:36:20.63,00:36:20.63,"about what his game plan was, why he was willing to present"
559,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,"her to get her to the top, it wasn't, ""Well, let me talk to"
560,00:36:28.87,00:36:28.87,"V."" It was, ""Well, you can get with"
561,00:36:30.50,00:36:30.50,"me and V, and then we'll have the numbers."""
562,00:36:32.63,00:36:32.63,"That tells me a lot of what Sean's been doing and thinking,"
563,00:36:35.80,00:36:35.80,"and I think he's disingenuous. >> Jeff, I just wanted to,"
564,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,because it was a remark made to me.
565,00:36:40.47,00:36:40.47,"I want to defend my character. First of all, I don't think it"
566,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,"was disingenuous. What I think is five minute ago,"
567,00:36:47.07,00:36:47.07,I stick to my word. V and I didn't have an
568,00:36:49.97,00:36:49.97,"agreement, so what I put out there was V could have been"
569,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,Tammy or anybody. What I put out there was a life
570,00:36:56.93,00:36:56.93,"raft to say, ""Yo, hang on,"" and I put it out there."
571,00:36:59.93,00:36:59.93,Me and V didn't have no agreement.
572,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,"We've been the underdog, and it's not like we've had an"
573,00:37:04.03,00:37:04.03,agreement. Like when you're playing cards
574,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,and Monopoly and you make a last-ditch.
575,00:37:07.47,00:37:07.47,It's not disingenuous. I've never broken my word.
576,00:37:09.80,00:37:09.80,I stick to that to this point. I threw something out there.
577,00:37:12.80,00:37:12.80,Either she's going to say yes or no.
578,00:37:14.77,00:37:14.77,"If she says no, then by all means, my card has folded, then"
579,00:37:18.07,00:37:18.07,vote me out. Let me go.
580,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,"If she says yes, let's roll the dice."
581,00:37:21.47,00:37:21.47,">> PROBST: So let me just recap. So Sean and V are saying, ""Give"
582,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,"one of us immunity, side with us; we'll go with you."""
583,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,"Paschal and Neleh are saying, ""Side with us."
584,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,"We'll go with you."" So that's where it stands."
585,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,Anybody want to add anything? >> Why didn't she know about
586,00:37:36.37,00:37:36.37,their pact a long time ago? >> I assumed it was there.
587,00:37:39.03,00:37:39.03,">> I know you assumed, but you know..."
588,00:37:40.80,00:37:40.80,">> See, I thought she knew until that night at the fire."
589,00:37:43.43,00:37:43.43,>> Nothing was confirmed. >> Wait a second.
590,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,Wait a second. We never hid it from anybody.
591,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,So don't talk about assumptions. >> Yeah.
592,00:37:50.53,00:37:50.53,">> I'm not saying you hid it, but being so close, why wouldn't"
593,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"she know? >> Yeah, but I don't care."
594,00:37:57.37,00:37:57.37,">> She knows now. Well, point the finger at me."
595,00:37:59.73,00:37:59.73,The point is you didn't know two weeks ago.
596,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,">> Well, I'll point it at you. >> All right, point it at me."
597,00:38:04.43,00:38:04.43,">> The point is, she knows now. She knew today."
598,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"She knows everything. >> No, no, no."
599,00:38:09.77,00:38:09.77,>> If you'd just listen once in a while instead of running your
600,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,mouth all the time. >> I'm listening!
601,00:38:16.20,00:38:16.20,I'm listening! What are you saying?
602,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,>> I'm saying that she knew about it and we talked about the
603,00:38:21.23,00:38:21.23,"negotiations. >> Please, please."
604,00:38:22.73,00:38:22.73,She did not know. She just told me.
605,00:38:24.37,00:38:24.37,">> Look, this is the deal. >> They ain't going to shush me"
606,00:38:27.17,00:38:27.17,"up. Vote me out, but I'm going to"
607,00:38:28.70,00:38:28.70,speak my mind. She did not know.
608,00:38:30.23,00:38:30.23,"Now, they can play this hanky- panky with everybody and do it"
609,00:38:33.20,00:38:33.20,because I'm always speaking out. Vote me out if that's your
610,00:38:36.23,00:38:36.23,conscience. But you all deal with the BS.
611,00:38:38.43,00:38:38.43,She did not know. You're putting words in my mouth
612,00:38:41.07,00:38:41.07,right now. All right?
613,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,>> But you didn't know about their pact though is all I'm
614,00:38:44.60,00:38:44.60,"saying. >> I didn't hear officially, but"
615,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,it's a logical assumption because they've known each other
616,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,"for so long. >> Come on, man."
617,00:38:51.03,00:38:51.03,"I know I'm young and I might talk a whole lot, but some of"
618,00:38:54.27,00:38:54.27,"the stuff I make sense. Damn, I do listen."
619,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"I still got respect for you. But damn it, I'm a man, too, and"
620,00:39:00.07,00:39:00.07,"all I'm saying is none of this jives up, because if these two"
621,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,"has a pact, that means they're doing the same thing they're"
622,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,accusing me and V of doing. I'm disingenuous when I do it...
623,00:39:09.53,00:39:09.53,>> Just let it go. >> Okay.
624,00:39:12.20,00:39:12.20,>> Let it go. >> PROBST: All right.
625,00:39:14.40,00:39:14.40,"So, here's where we're at. Kathy, very powerful situation."
626,00:39:18.90,00:39:18.90,V and Sean obviously want your vote.
627,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,Paschal and Neleh obviously want your vote.
628,00:39:23.67,00:39:23.67,It's all going to come down to what decision you make when you
629,00:39:26.37,00:39:26.37,walk from here to there. It is time to vote.
630,00:39:28.50,00:39:28.50,"Sean, you're first. >> The girl-next-door act don't"
631,00:39:45.90,00:39:45.90,work on me. You're just here for the ride.
632,00:39:48.63,00:39:48.63,"Y'all trying to win a million just like me, and I hope"
633,00:39:50.63,00:39:50.63,"you go out tonight. >> Sean, this vote is for you."
634,00:40:01.53,00:40:01.53,Just too much drama. I just can't stand it.
635,00:40:16.40,00:40:16.40,>> A great competitor. >> My vote tonight is for Neleh.
636,00:40:32.37,00:40:32.37,"She's a great girl, but I think she started a little late in"
637,00:40:35.73,00:40:35.73,"trying to play the game, and, um, that's about it."
638,00:40:57.83,00:40:57.83,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
639,00:41:00.20,00:41:00.20,The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
640,00:41:02.37,00:41:02.37,immediately. I'll read the votes.
641,00:41:07.47,00:41:07.47,First vote: Neleh. Sean.
642,00:41:20.30,00:41:20.30,Neleh. Sean.
643,00:41:26.90,00:41:26.90,Two votes Neleh; two votes Sean. Final vote.
644,00:41:38.70,00:41:38.70,Sean. >> D'oh!
645,00:41:40.37,00:41:40.37,>> PROBST: You need to bring me your torch.
646,00:41:49.80,00:41:49.80,"Sean, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
647,00:42:10.80,00:42:10.80,"Well, I don't know if you noticed tonight or not, but the"
648,00:42:14.00,00:42:14.00,"jury is all dressed the same, wearing black."
649,00:42:16.40,00:42:16.40,I don't know if it means anything or not.
650,00:42:18.50,00:42:18.50,I do know this: the only thing that guarantees you a spot in
651,00:42:21.97,00:42:21.97,"the final two is winning two more immunities, and that begins"
652,00:42:25.53,00:42:25.53,tomorrow. You guys can head back to camp.
653,00:42:51.40,00:42:51.40,">> It's a lot one can say, but I just know that through it all,"
654,00:42:56.10,00:42:56.10,"it's been a blast. Y'all, forgive me for any"
655,00:42:58.63,00:42:58.63,"mistakes that I made. I'm just a humble, young man"
656,00:43:01.90,00:43:01.90,trying to find my way through this world.
657,00:43:04.67,00:43:04.67,I just say keep your head up. God bless America.
658,00:43:08.67,00:43:08.67,Peace.
