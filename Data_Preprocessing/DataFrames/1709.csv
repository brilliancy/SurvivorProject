5,00:00:16.17,00:00:16.17,...to create the most powerful alliance in the game.
6,00:00:18.17,00:00:18.17,>> I'm like a little rat. I go...
7,00:00:20.54,00:00:20.54,"You mess with me, then you're gone in this game."
8,00:00:22.79,00:00:22.79,>> PROBST: His smartest play was when he convinced Susie to
9,00:00:25.21,00:00:25.21,"switch alliances and join him. >> It's going down, Kenny."
10,00:00:28.12,00:00:28.12,I knew you were my boy. >> PROBST: The only potential
11,00:00:30.29,00:00:30.29,roadblocks on his path to the finals are the two hidden
12,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,immunity idols: a real one... >> Mm. Okay.
13,00:00:37.12,00:00:37.12,>> PROBST: ...owned by Sugar... >> I found it.
14,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,>> PROBST: ...and an amazing-looking counterfeit
15,00:00:41.25,00:00:41.25,created by Bob. >> This is my new fake idol.
16,00:00:43.29,00:00:43.29,">> PROBST: If either idol comes into play, the game changes, and"
17,00:00:46.21,00:00:46.21,Kenny's plans could go up in smoke.
18,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,>> It's sort of like when you're holding up a bank.
19,00:00:50.62,00:00:50.62,You don't necessarily need the gun.
20,00:00:52.58,00:00:52.58,"If they think you got a gun, they might leave you alone."
21,00:00:55.08,00:00:55.08,>> PROBST: Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
22,00:01:08.25,00:01:08.25,">> Let's get it going, man. >> That's right."
23,00:01:10.71,00:01:10.71,>> Nobag back in the hizzy. (laughter)
24,00:01:13.04,00:01:13.04,>> Nobag. >> Kenny and Crystal know
25,00:01:16.67,00:01:16.67,exactly what's going on in camp. They know the power is shifting.
26,00:01:20.17,00:01:20.17,">> That was an intense session. Dude, that was the biggest war"
27,00:01:22.58,00:01:22.58,zone yet. >> Yeah.
28,00:01:24.58,00:01:24.58,(laughter) >> Everybody better be pretty
29,00:01:26.58,00:01:26.58,happy right here. >> I thought I was the target
30,00:01:30.17,00:01:30.17,tonight because I was pissing a whole bunch of people off.
31,00:01:32.83,00:01:32.83,That wasn't the case. They made more of a smart vote.
32,00:01:35.17,00:01:35.17,Charlie's got a lot of friends. I don't.
33,00:01:42.12,00:01:42.12,>> 'Cause he's the big threat. >> He's a good sport.
34,00:01:44.92,00:01:44.92,">> Yes, he is. >> He's awesome."
35,00:01:46.88,00:01:46.88,He went out with class. >> And we're in Gabon for
36,00:01:49.58,00:01:49.58,another full moon. >> I'm gonna do whatever I think
37,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,I can do. When I wake up tomorrow
38,00:01:54.04,00:01:54.04,"morning, I'm going to reevaluate the situation and"
39,00:01:55.88,00:01:55.88,"hope to come out with something. I mean, Kenny and Crystal are"
40,00:01:58.58,00:01:58.58,taking out my entire alliance. My chances are very slim.
41,00:02:01.92,00:02:01.92,"You know, most likely, me, Bob and Randy-- we're going to go"
42,00:02:04.25,00:02:04.25,"home, and we don't know in what order, but we're going to go"
43,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,home. >> It's crazy.
44,00:02:08.75,00:02:08.75,">> Yeah, they just... >> Like the beginning of the"

50,00:03:20.12,00:03:20.12,You don't? >> No.

52,00:03:26.50,00:03:26.50,the idol. Bob still thinks the idol's out
53,00:03:28.96,00:03:28.96,"there. I kind of feel bad about it,"
54,00:03:33.04,00:03:33.04,but it is hilarious. >> Okay.
55,00:03:48.75,00:03:48.75,>> You did? >> That does look very good.
56,00:03:56.08,00:03:56.08,"You are very creative. How did you make that, Bob?"
57,00:03:59.67,00:03:59.67,>> I stole some of those beads. I took that resin and put it
58,00:04:02.71,00:04:02.71,"down there. >> Oh, my God, they're awesome."
59,00:04:04.75,00:04:04.75,>> Looks good. >> That's really good.
60,00:04:06.54,00:04:06.54,>> Fooled you. >> So...
61,00:04:12.12,00:04:12.12,">> You know, this game is getting crazy."
62,00:04:14.25,00:04:14.25,"Bob has made himself a fake idol, and he made it out of"
63,00:04:18.04,00:04:18.04,resin and beads. And it's got a little happy face
64,00:04:20.62,00:04:20.62,on it. I guess Bob might have some kind
65,00:04:23.21,00:04:23.21,of strategy in showing me the fake immunity idol.
66,00:04:25.21,00:04:25.21,Maybe he's an evil genius. I don't know.
67,00:04:28.04,00:04:28.04,"Just try and... try and relax. >> You really think it's Susie,"
68,00:04:36.46,00:04:36.46,"Crystal, and, uh...? >> Kenny, yes."
69,00:04:38.58,00:04:38.58,>> And-And Kenny in the final three?
70,00:04:40.62,00:04:40.62,">> Yes, I do. But I think they've probably"
71,00:04:43.88,00:04:43.88,"sold that story to Sugar and Matty, and they're so stupid,"
72,00:04:46.08,00:04:46.08,"they buy it. I mean, don't they realize"
73,00:04:48.12,00:04:48.12,there's five of them? They can't all be final three.
74,00:04:50.50,00:04:50.50,>> Yeah. >> Hello!
75,00:04:52.62,00:04:52.62,">> There's a whole lot of game left, though, you know?"
76,00:04:54.92,00:04:54.92,"Corinne is still an ally, but what can you do with two people?"
77,00:04:58.38,00:04:58.38,We've got immunity idols. We got huge physical threats
78,00:05:01.08,00:05:01.08,"like Matty. Uh, I continue..."
79,00:05:03.33,00:05:03.33,I'm planning on just continuing to be my same charming self.
80,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,I don't like any of these people.
81,00:05:10.21,00:05:10.21,>> I hate them! >> And I hate them.
82,00:05:12.21,00:05:12.21,"And if I pretended to be nice and like them, like Matty's"
83,00:05:15.12,00:05:15.12,"doing, I'm not very good at that."
84,00:05:17.67,00:05:17.67,"It would show through, and I said, the only..."
85,00:05:20.00,00:05:20.00,>> You're less damaging to yourself by just shutting it
86,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,"down. >> Yeah. Well-Well, shutting it"
87,00:05:24.17,00:05:24.17,"down, as well as continue to being nice."
88,00:05:26.21,00:05:26.21,">> Don't even bother trying to be nice to Sugar, you know."
89,00:05:28.58,00:05:28.58,"Just keep away from them and work on Matty, and just see if"
90,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,you can get him to understand he's going to be on the chopping
91,00:05:34.00,00:05:34.00,block. >> The hand I have to...
92,00:05:35.83,00:05:35.83,>> Give him the final three with us.
93,00:05:38.12,00:05:38.12,>> Desperate times call for desperate measures.
94,00:05:39.92,00:05:39.92,"We've got to get somebody to flip-flop now and come with us,"
95,00:05:43.38,00:05:43.38,and that somebody has got to be Matty because the credibility
96,00:05:46.92,00:05:46.92,of all the others is crap. >> You guys!
97,00:05:50.92,00:05:50.92,Tree mail has individual envelopes for everybody!
98,00:05:52.83,00:05:52.83,"(gasps and cheers) >> ""Going, going, gone."

101,00:06:06.38,00:06:06.38,>> Auction. >> 500.
102,00:06:10.83,00:06:10.83,>> I'm not going to spend a dime in the auction unless I get
103,00:06:13.71,00:06:13.71,something that is going to help me stay in this game.
104,00:06:16.21,00:06:16.21,"I mean, that is worth every penny of $500."

204,00:10:38.54,00:10:38.54,"Sold to Matty. Kenny had a lot more money,"
205,00:10:41.00,00:10:41.00,"passed it up. $400 for a cheeseburger, fries,"
206,00:10:44.04,00:10:44.04,"the fixings, and a soda. >> Oh, and it's on a ciabatta"
207,00:10:46.96,00:10:46.96,"bun. >> Oh, man. Nice."
208,00:10:48.62,00:10:48.62,(laughter) >> I think I'm actually going
209,00:10:50.50,00:10:50.50,"to get out, guys. It's really hot."
210,00:10:52.38,00:10:52.38,">> No, don't get out! What the hell are you doing,"
211,00:10:54.62,00:10:54.62,woman?! This is the first bath you've
212,00:10:56.96,00:10:56.96,had in 28 days. >> PROBST: You done in your
213,00:11:00.33,00:11:00.33,bath? >> Yep.
214,00:11:02.04,00:11:02.04,>> PROBST: All right. >> That's cuckoo.
215,00:11:04.29,00:11:04.29,I would have been there the whole time.
216,00:11:07.08,00:11:07.08,>> PROBST: Next item will remain covered.

219,00:11:15.33,00:11:15.33,>> Keep going. >> 220.
220,00:11:17.33,00:11:17.33,>> 240. >> 260.
221,00:11:19.08,00:11:19.08,>> 280. >> He can have it.
222,00:11:21.04,00:11:21.04,">> PROBST: Kenny, giving it up again."
223,00:11:22.75,00:11:22.75,">> Yeah, he can have it. I know it's going to be"
224,00:11:24.54,00:11:24.54,"something bad. >> Ooh, Kenny."
225,00:11:26.75,00:11:26.75,"PROBST: Sold to Randy, $280. >> What is that?"
226,00:11:30.29,00:11:30.29,">> Ooh, good job, Randy! >> PROBST: Spaghetti, garlic"
227,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,"bread, and a glass of wine. >> Sorry, man."
228,00:11:34.92,00:11:34.92,"Next item, inside this sealed bottle is a note."
229,00:11:39.96,00:11:39.96,This note gives you a huge advantage in the next immunity
230,00:11:43.83,00:11:43.83,challenge. >> All 500.
231,00:11:46.17,00:11:46.17,">> PROBST: Suddenly, Corinne is interested."
232,00:11:47.75,00:11:47.75,That makes Kenny the only one with enough money to outbid her.
233,00:11:51.08,00:11:51.08,>> PROBST: Going once... Going twice...
234,00:11:53.21,00:11:53.21,>> Yeah? >> PROBST: Kenny gives it up
235,00:11:54.58,00:11:54.58,again. Sold to Corinne for $500.
236,00:11:58.21,00:11:58.21,>> I hope it was worth it. >> PROBST: Here's how this
237,00:12:00.62,00:12:00.62,works. Take this bottle.
238,00:12:02.38,00:12:02.38,It needs to remain sealed until I see you at the next immunity
239,00:12:05.92,00:12:05.92,"challenge. >> Okay, thanks."
240,00:12:09.00,00:12:09.00,>> PROBST: Next item: first 20 bucks buys this for the tribe.
241,00:12:13.12,00:12:13.12,>> 20. >> PROBST: Sold to Randy.

243,00:12:18.42,00:12:18.42,>> PROBST: You bought this for the tribe.
244,00:12:20.71,00:12:20.71,">> How sweet, Randy. >> PROBST: You just made a lot"
245,00:12:23.04,00:12:23.04,"of people very happy. >> Oh, my God!"
246,00:12:25.46,00:12:25.46,"(cheering) >> Thank you, Randy!"
247,00:12:27.17,00:12:27.17,>> I can have them all to myself if I want?
248,00:12:29.71,00:12:29.71,">> PROBST: For the tribe, Randy. >> Okay."
249,00:12:33.71,00:12:33.71,Who wants one? Would you like one?
250,00:12:36.38,00:12:36.38,">> I don't want one, thank you. >> Are you sure?"
251,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,>> I couldn't possibly. >> Would you like one?
252,00:12:39.92,00:12:39.92,">> Sure. >> Randy, this is so awesome."
253,00:12:42.25,00:12:42.25,">> Are you sure, Sugar? >> Matty is getting it."
254,00:12:45.46,00:12:45.46,>> It's not yours to give to Matty.
255,00:12:47.38,00:12:47.38,"I'm the boss. You can have two, if you'd like."
256,00:12:50.83,00:12:50.83,">> Oh, I'll take one and a half. Can I do that?"
257,00:12:53.04,00:12:53.04,">> Sure. >> PROBST: So, Randy, you're"
258,00:12:55.00,00:12:55.00,giving part of Sugar's to Corinne?
259,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,">> Uh, Sugar doesn't have one. I offered her one, and she"
260,00:12:59.42,00:12:59.42,"didn't take one, so, they're mine."
261,00:13:02.21,00:13:02.21,>> Thank you. You want half?
262,00:13:04.33,00:13:04.33,">> Yes, please. >> Go for it."
263,00:13:05.88,00:13:05.88,">> Thank you. Last chance, you can have a "
264,00:13:08.17,00:13:08.17,full one. >> Thank you.
265,00:13:11.25,00:13:11.25,>> PROBST: Randy offers Sugar his own cookie.
266,00:13:14.88,00:13:14.88,She takes it and gives it to Matty.
267,00:13:16.83,00:13:16.83,">> Yeah, would you like to repeat that?"
268,00:13:18.42,00:13:18.42,>> PROBST: Wow. I think it worked out the way
269,00:13:20.79,00:13:20.79,"it worked out. >> Randy, you at least have to"
270,00:13:22.83,00:13:22.83,take this. >> This is better for me.
271,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,">> You sure? >> PROBST: Well, I'd suggest you"
272,00:13:26.21,00:13:26.21,start eating those quickly 'cause the Survivor auction is
273,00:13:28.33,00:13:28.33,over. >> Sugar-- she can kiss my ass.
274,00:13:31.21,00:13:31.21,"If she thinks I was bad before, I'm just going to turn it up a"
275,00:13:34.12,00:13:34.12,notch. There's a lot of fight left in
276,00:13:36.79,00:13:36.79,this dog. >> PROBST: Have a good night.
277,00:13:48.62,00:13:48.62,">> Welcome home, Nobag. (laughter)"
278,00:13:50.50,00:13:50.50,">> Check it out. >> Corinne, I have to say, good"
279,00:13:53.08,00:13:53.08,things come to those who wait. >> That's right.
280,00:13:55.21,00:13:55.21,">> I thought you were blowing it, but you made the good"
281,00:13:57.29,00:13:57.29,"decision. And, Sugar, I have to say, that"
282,00:13:59.67,00:13:59.67,was the most righteous gift I've ever been given.
283,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,">> What gift, Matty? You got to be kidding me."
284,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,"That wasn't a gift from her, man."
285,00:14:06.21,00:14:06.21,Weren't you watching? >> Thought she handed it to me.
286,00:14:08.25,00:14:08.25,">> Yeah, but that was my cookie. I didn't get one."
287,00:14:10.29,00:14:10.29,">> Oh. >> You had two, I had none."
288,00:14:13.04,00:14:13.04,>> Sorry. >> But not your fault.
289,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,"I left the auction broke, full, half drunk, and pissed off."
290,00:14:21.04,00:14:21.04,I got a little room left for one big cookie.
291,00:14:23.62,00:14:23.62,So I'm going to burn this house down in the next day or so.
292,00:14:26.58,00:14:26.58,">> Oh, my God. >> Over a cookie."
293,00:14:30.46,00:14:30.46,Over a cookie. How funny is that?
294,00:14:33.75,00:14:33.75,"Oh, my gosh. Have you ever seen a grown man"
295,00:14:39.92,00:14:39.92,get so mad over a chocolate chip cookie?
296,00:14:42.67,00:14:42.67,And the only reason I took his damn cookie is because he didn't
297,00:14:45.42,00:14:45.42,want to give me a cookie. He wanted to give everybody a
298,00:14:48.58,00:14:48.58,cookie but Sugar because Sugar's evil.
299,00:14:56.17,00:14:56.17,">> How you feeling, big buddy? Still bitter?"
300,00:14:58.75,00:14:58.75,">> Ah, there's no one to talk to."
301,00:15:01.12,00:15:01.12,Nobody listens to me. >> What about me?
302,00:15:03.17,00:15:03.17,">> You're busy talking to everybody else, man."
303,00:15:05.00,00:15:05.00,"What we witnessed today at the auction-- I mean, I was treated"
304,00:15:08.08,00:15:08.08,"like a dog. >> You've set yourself up,"
305,00:15:10.08,00:15:10.08,Randy. We've got to drop the attitude
306,00:15:12.67,00:15:12.67,and just be cool. >> I'm not going to try to talk
307,00:15:15.25,00:15:15.25,"to them, any of them. >> You know, obviously, we're in"
308,00:15:18.25,00:15:18.25,a desperate position. We're three people.
309,00:15:20.42,00:15:20.42,"You guys were five. So, you know that if you, you"
310,00:15:22.88,00:15:22.88,"know, if you have any kind of idea, if you'd like to work with"
311,00:15:25.88,00:15:25.88,"us in any way, we're certainly open to it."
312,00:15:29.08,00:15:29.08,>> You're on the outs. The final three in this game is
313,00:15:31.92,00:15:31.92,"Kenny, Susie, and Crystal. Matty's got two ways to play."
314,00:15:36.25,00:15:36.25,He can stay with the original Fang and go to the finals that
315,00:15:39.50,00:15:39.50,"way, or he can come with me and Corinne and Bob and have a shot"
316,00:15:42.71,00:15:42.71,at winning. >> It's nothing to be ashamed
317,00:15:48.58,00:15:48.58,of. >> I just arrived at Exile.
318,00:16:02.25,00:16:02.25,"I'm going to go for the clue for the immunity idol, and that's a"
319,00:16:05.50,00:16:05.50,"real clear choice for me. The next couple Tribals, there's"
320,00:16:10.12,00:16:10.12,"a very tight group that are going to vote Corinne, Randy,"
321,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,"and myself off. ""Across the lake you see so"
322,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,"well, there lies a sandy crater. The object hidden in its floor"
323,00:16:22.58,00:16:22.58,"will surely help you later."" Oh, damn."
324,00:16:26.67,00:16:26.67,I realized the extra clue I got this time was a clue that I'd
325,00:16:30.62,00:16:30.62,already found on my own last time.
326,00:16:33.62,00:16:33.62,"I was a little depressed, but I got a lot of time here, and what"
327,00:16:37.25,00:16:37.25,"I'm going to do is, I'm going to go for my own little safari."
328,00:16:40.21,00:16:40.21,I just think that will be more rewarding for me than aimlessly
329,00:16:43.25,00:16:43.25,looking around for an idol. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
330,00:16:54.08,00:16:54.08,"When I came to Africa, I came here to experience not only"
331,00:16:58.21,00:16:58.21,"Survivor, but to sort of learn about myself, to really think"
332,00:17:02.46,00:17:02.46,"about how lucky a person I am, what a wonderful family I have."
333,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,It takes your breath away. And what a beautiful place
334,00:17:11.08,00:17:11.08,Africa is. I see why they call it the
335,00:17:14.83,00:17:14.83,Garden of Eden. >> Trying?
336,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,Trying? >> Are you even gonna try?
337,00:17:39.12,00:17:39.12,">> Okay, I'm coming. I'm going to sit down and"
338,00:17:41.42,00:17:41.42,express. >> Express?
339,00:17:43.25,00:17:43.25,"(overlapping chatter) >> Okay, you guys, we're getting"
340,00:17:45.21,00:17:45.21,down to a point where it's pretty dicey for us.
341,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,">> Yeah. >> Okay, so, we-we got to keep"
342,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,"the five of us strong, right? >> Yes."
343,00:17:51.75,00:17:51.75,>> Yes. >> Randy.
344,00:17:53.50,00:17:53.50,"Obviously, it's a no-brainer. He's set himself up."
345,00:17:55.54,00:17:55.54,He's made his own coffin. >> Yes...
346,00:17:57.58,00:17:57.58,>> But... >> But?
347,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,">> Bob should go next just to get him out of the loop, so he"
348,00:18:02.25,00:18:02.25,doesn't win immunities and end our five-some up.
349,00:18:04.04,00:18:04.04,Randy's not going to win any challenges.
350,00:18:06.12,00:18:06.12,Corinne's not going to win any challenges.
351,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,"Bringing them in to the final final six, final seven is way"
352,00:18:10.71,00:18:10.71,safer for us. I think Bob should go next.
353,00:18:13.50,00:18:13.50,>> I'm noticing now that Matty is really playing the game and
354,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,"that he is trying to take control, and that he is a"
355,00:18:19.25,00:18:19.25,"physical threat, and he's trying to get rid of Bob, who is the"
356,00:18:22.08,00:18:22.08,"other physical threat, and hang on to Randy for some reason."
357,00:18:24.62,00:18:24.62,Is he going to join up with Randy 'cause he's wizening up
358,00:18:27.04,00:18:27.04,and know that it's smart to have a jerk at the end?
359,00:18:29.62,00:18:29.62,">> We got to have a plan, so it it has to be Bob."
360,00:18:32.21,00:18:32.21,">> Okay. >> It has to be Randy, then"
361,00:18:34.29,00:18:34.29,"Corinne. Bob, Randy, Corinne."
362,00:18:36.08,00:18:36.08,>> Okay. >> That's the order.
363,00:18:37.46,00:18:37.46,>> Then we're down to the four. >> It sucks.
364,00:18:39.21,00:18:39.21,">> I know it sucks, but stop... >> Hello!"
365,00:18:44.83,00:18:44.83,">> Okay, fine. >> Here he is."
366,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,Here-Here he comes. Here he comes.
367,00:18:50.08,00:18:50.08,"Bob, Randy, Corinne. Bob, Randy, Corinne."
368,00:18:52.04,00:18:52.04,">> I know. >> Good morning, sunshine."
369,00:19:22.08,00:19:22.08,">> What you got for me? >> FYI, I'm crashing and burning"
370,00:19:24.71,00:19:24.71,today. >> I love this.
371,00:19:27.25,00:19:27.25,>> I stayed up all night just thinking of the most diabolical
372,00:19:30.54,00:19:30.54,thing that we could do to keep us in the game and get the worst
373,00:19:34.58,00:19:34.58,"person in this game out. Corinne, myself, and Bob are on"
374,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,the outside. Our only chance is to shake
375,00:19:41.42,00:19:41.42,things up. I'm going to be crashing and
376,00:19:43.79,00:19:43.79,"burning all day, make everybody miserable, showing these"
377,00:19:46.12,00:19:46.12,morons... Just putting them in their
378,00:19:49.92,00:19:49.92,place. The plan is for me to act really
379,00:19:52.21,00:19:52.21,"nasty, continue to mix it up with everybody, and the old Fang"
380,00:19:55.25,00:19:55.25,people are going to vote for me. Our only prayer is if Bob would
381,00:19:59.25,00:19:59.25,give me the idol. >> This is a good idea.
382,00:20:01.96,00:20:01.96,>> Everyone vote me out. I spring the idol out at Tribal.
383,00:20:06.92,00:20:06.92,"Susie is three votes, and goes home."
384,00:20:09.12,00:20:09.12,>> I love it. >> It's our only prayer.
385,00:20:11.08,00:20:11.08,>> That's a great plan. >> We get the feeling that Bob
386,00:20:13.42,00:20:13.42,"probably found the immunity idol, and the plan is to"
387,00:20:16.58,00:20:16.58,convince Bob to give me the hidden immunity idol.
388,00:20:20.75,00:20:20.75,"I play the idol. Voil\xc3\xa0-- Susie, joke's on you."
389,00:20:23.08,00:20:23.08,"You're going home. >> So, think about it, enjoy the"
390,00:20:25.83,00:20:25.83,thought. Yeah. >> I don't need to think about
391,00:20:28.12,00:20:28.12,it. I'm-I'm totally on board.
392,00:20:30.04,00:20:30.04,"I'm going to talk to Bob... >> I mean, it buys us three more"
393,00:20:32.62,00:20:32.62,"days, and something new could happen."
394,00:20:34.42,00:20:34.42,>> I will talk to Bob. Let me see if I can get Bob on
395,00:20:37.21,00:20:37.21,board. >> You like it?
396,00:20:38.79,00:20:38.79,>> I love it. >> I not only want Susie to go
397,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,"home, but I want to blindside her."
398,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,The reason that myself and Corinne and Bob are in the
399,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,predicament we are in is because Susie flipped.
400,00:20:49.33,00:20:49.33,"She went with Crystal and Kenny, and they voted Marcus out."
401,00:20:53.25,00:20:53.25,"That's part of the game, but the hell with her."
402,00:20:55.88,00:20:55.88,"Uh, this would be sweet, sweet revenge."
403,00:21:04.75,00:21:04.75,(Randy imitates yawning) >> Why do you have to tell the
404,00:21:07.12,00:21:07.12,world? >> There's not a...
405,00:21:18.04,00:21:18.04,"There's not a normal person among them, except you, and you"
406,00:21:20.46,00:21:20.46,even... even whored yourself out.
407,00:21:22.62,00:21:22.62,">> Oh, my God. Don't do this, dude."
408,00:21:25.42,00:21:25.42,Don't. >> You know you have.
409,00:21:28.38,00:21:28.38,"You know, I don't blame you. It's worth a million dollars to"
410,00:21:31.08,00:21:31.08,you. It's not to me.
411,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,">> Oh, my God. Randy just sealed his fate, you"
412,00:21:37.00,00:21:37.00,know. I've done what I can.
413,00:21:39.46,00:21:39.46,And if you're not going to listen to what I have to say or
414,00:21:42.50,00:21:42.50,"take my advice, then, I mean, there's nothing I can do."
415,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,"It's a no-brainer that Randy has to go home now, and he's"
416,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,going out with a bang. >> Guess how many of those
417,00:21:51.25,00:21:51.25,cookies I ate? >> Those freaking cookies.
418,00:21:53.25,00:21:53.25,">> I was in charge of every single one of them, but I didn't"
419,00:21:55.50,00:21:55.50,"get any. It-it was for the tribe, and I"
420,00:21:58.08,00:21:58.08,"could do anything-- I could put it in the dirt and stomp on it,"
421,00:22:01.17,00:22:01.17,if I wanted to. >> I got the impression that you
422,00:22:03.46,00:22:03.46,really didn't want to give it... >> To anybody.
423,00:22:05.79,00:22:05.79,>> I'm tired of this story. >> Thank you.
424,00:22:07.88,00:22:07.88,>> You're right. I'm done.
425,00:22:09.83,00:22:09.83,>> Then shut the (bleep) up. >> I can talk when I want.
426,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,>> Randy got to go. Randy needs to go.
427,00:22:17.25,00:22:17.25,He is a troll. He is wreaking havoc in the
428,00:22:20.79,00:22:20.79,Nobag tribe. >> That man.
429,00:22:24.21,00:22:24.21,">> He's going home. >> Oh, yeah, doesn't matter."
430,00:22:35.08,00:22:35.08,>> I like where I'm sitting right now.
431,00:22:36.92,00:22:36.92,They're all freaking out. And that's a real good thing.
432,00:22:39.92,00:22:39.92,"The more they freak out, the more paranoia sets, the more"
433,00:22:42.96,00:22:42.96,Operation Strong-arm can be effective.
434,00:22:45.75,00:22:45.75,"Man, we've still got an immunity challenge to play."
435,00:23:00.75,00:23:00.75,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Bob returning"
436,00:23:11.62,00:23:11.62,"from Exile Island. >> How's it going, Bob?"
437,00:23:19.04,00:23:19.04,">> Good morning, gang. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get"
438,00:23:22.71,00:23:22.71,to today's immunity challenge? >> Yes.
439,00:23:24.71,00:23:24.71,">> PROBST: First things first-- take back the necklace, Susie."
440,00:23:28.71,00:23:28.71,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
441,00:23:34.46,00:23:34.46,"is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
442,00:23:38.46,00:23:38.46,race across a series of balance beams carrying a bag of puzzle
443,00:23:43.12,00:23:43.12,"blocks. When you reach the finish,"
444,00:23:46.46,00:23:46.46,"you'll head back to the start, do it again."
445,00:23:48.75,00:23:48.75,The first two people to get their three bags across the
446,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,"line move on to the final round. In the final round, you will"
447,00:23:56.83,00:23:56.83,empty your bags filled with puzzle blocks.
448,00:23:59.75,00:23:59.75,You must arrange those puzzle blocks along a multi-angled
449,00:24:03.04,00:24:03.04,platform while avoiding trip wires which could tip your
450,00:24:07.04,00:24:07.04,"blocks, forcing you to start over."
451,00:24:09.54,00:24:09.54,>> Mmm. >> PROBST: Your goal is to
452,00:24:11.58,00:24:11.58,arrange your blocks so they will fall one into another like
453,00:24:14.96,00:24:14.96,"dominoes, raising a flag. First person to raise their flag"
454,00:24:19.88,00:24:19.88,"wins immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-seven shot at winning"
455,00:24:24.46,00:24:24.46,"this game and a million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council."
456,00:24:27.88,00:24:27.88,"Somebody will be voted out. Corinne, at the auction, you"
457,00:24:31.08,00:24:31.08,bought an advantage in today's immunity challenge.
458,00:24:33.88,00:24:33.88,You have the bottle? >> Please be something magical.
459,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,"This is good. ""You will sit out for the first"
460,00:24:40.17,00:24:40.17,stage of this challenge and move directly into the final
461,00:24:42.25,00:24:42.25,"round."" >> PROBST: Huge advantage in"
462,00:24:44.25,00:24:44.25,this challenge. >> Thank you!
463,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,>> PROBST: Corinne is now guaranteed a one-in-three shot
464,00:24:48.08,00:24:48.08,at winning this challenge and staying alive in this game.
465,00:24:50.08,00:24:50.08,Corinne gets to sit out the first round.
466,00:24:52.38,00:24:52.38,"Everybody else, we'll get started."
467,00:24:56.50,00:24:56.50,"Here we go. For immunity, first two people"
468,00:24:59.08,00:24:59.08,to finish move on to the final round.
469,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,"Survivors, ready? Go!"
470,00:25:08.88,00:25:08.88,"Matty off to a quick start. Matty doesn't hesitate, has his"
471,00:25:12.46,00:25:12.46,first bag across. Kenny has his first bag across.
472,00:25:15.88,00:25:15.88,It is Matty and Kenny. Bob is across.
473,00:25:20.04,00:25:20.04,Susie's across. Matty across with his second
474,00:25:22.50,00:25:22.50,"bag. Sugar, no good, gotta go back."
475,00:25:25.08,00:25:25.08,Here comes Kenny with his second bag.
476,00:25:27.96,00:25:27.96,Matty's got his final bag. Susie with her second bag.
477,00:25:30.96,00:25:30.96,Kenny makes it with his second bag.
478,00:25:34.46,00:25:34.46,"Bob falls off, no good. Gotta go back."
479,00:25:37.46,00:25:37.46,Matty's across with three bags. Matty's moving on.
480,00:25:42.08,00:25:42.08,Susie has her second bag. >> Damn it!
481,00:25:44.88,00:25:44.88,>> PROBST: Sugar and Crystal fall.
482,00:25:46.88,00:25:46.88,One spot left to get to the final round.
483,00:25:49.67,00:25:49.67,Who's going to get it? Kenny with a big leap.
484,00:25:53.46,00:25:53.46,"Kenny moves on to the final. It is Kenny, Matty, and Corinne"
485,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,"in the final round. All right, in the final round,"
486,00:26:06.33,00:26:06.33,"Kenny, Matty, Corinne. For immunity, survivors, ready?"
487,00:26:15.21,00:26:15.21,Go! Your job is to arrange those
488,00:26:19.25,00:26:19.25,puzzle blocks like a nice line of dominoes.
489,00:26:22.83,00:26:22.83,"Matty, Corinne, starting at the front."
490,00:26:28.83,00:26:28.83,"Kenny moving to the end, working his way backwards, three"
491,00:26:32.25,00:26:32.25,different strategies. Where this challenge gets tricky
492,00:26:36.75,00:26:36.75,is when you have to start maneuvering with those trip
493,00:26:39.67,00:26:39.67,ropes. One wrong move on those trip
494,00:26:43.67,00:26:43.67,ropes could knock over everything you've built so far.
495,00:26:49.67,00:26:49.67,Corinne making a lot of progress.
496,00:26:53.21,00:26:53.21,Matty seems to have the early lead.
497,00:26:56.38,00:26:56.38,Corinne taking her time. Kenny's pieces go down.
498,00:27:03.21,00:27:03.21,"Kenny may have made it more difficult, starting at the end."
499,00:27:07.83,00:27:07.83,Matty very close to knocking everything over.
500,00:27:12.42,00:27:12.42,Kenny picking up his fallen pieces.
501,00:27:18.83,00:27:18.83,Corinne making a lot of progress.
502,00:27:21.96,00:27:21.96,Question is: have you spaced them properly?
503,00:27:25.96,00:27:25.96,Matty has a bit of a lead if he's right.
504,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,Corinne still in it. Kenny and Matty arranging their
505,00:27:32.54,00:27:32.54,last pieces. Matty has two blocks left.
506,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,"If he's wrong, it's a lot of work for nothing."
507,00:27:38.96,00:27:38.96,Kenny gathering his last blocks. Kenny coming on strong now.
508,00:27:43.75,00:27:43.75,"Suddenly, Kenny's nearly complete."
509,00:27:47.17,00:27:47.17,Everybody's still in this challenge.
510,00:27:49.54,00:27:49.54,">> Jeff, I got it. >> PROBST: Kenny's going to give"
511,00:27:51.79,00:27:51.79,it a shot. >> Push it?
512,00:27:55.62,00:27:55.62,>> PROBST: Push it. >> Come on!
513,00:27:57.58,00:27:57.58,Go! Go! >> PROBST: Kenny's doesn't work.
514,00:27:59.62,00:27:59.62,He's got to rearrange it. Matty now heading back.
515,00:28:02.04,00:28:02.04,Do not panic! Take your time!
516,00:28:05.46,00:28:05.46,"Corinne now looking good. Corinne, by being calm, has kept"
517,00:28:10.25,00:28:10.25,herself in this challenge. Matty has placed all his blocks.
518,00:28:14.08,00:28:14.08,"Is he ready to give it a try? >> Ready to give it a try, Jeff!"
519,00:28:17.04,00:28:17.04,">> All right, I'm going to try it again, Jeff."
520,00:28:19.04,00:28:19.04,>> PROBST: Kenny's ready to give another shot.
521,00:28:21.08,00:28:21.08,">> I'm trying it, Jeff. >> PROBST: Corinne is now going."
522,00:28:23.12,00:28:23.12,Matty's in on it. This is it right here.
523,00:28:26.71,00:28:26.71,Everybody has their blocks moving.
524,00:28:29.71,00:28:29.71,Who is going to finish first? Matty's halfway through.
525,00:28:33.50,00:28:33.50,Kenny's looking good. Million dollars on the line.
526,00:28:37.12,00:28:37.12,"Does it go, Corinne? >> Almost."
527,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,Oh! Oh! Oh!
528,00:28:42.71,00:28:42.71,">> PROBST: No, Corinne's stopped short."
529,00:28:45.71,00:28:45.71,Matty's doesn't go. >> Go! Go! Go!
530,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,">> PROBST: Kenny wins immunity! Kenny, come on over."
531,00:29:04.12,00:29:04.12,"Congratulations. With this around your neck, you"
532,00:29:08.88,00:29:08.88,are safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
533,00:29:10.92,00:29:10.92,"As for the rest of you, after 30 days, this game will come to an"
534,00:29:14.08,00:29:14.08,end for one of you. Grab your stuff.
535,00:29:16.21,00:29:16.21,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
536,00:29:18.25,00:29:18.25,Congratulations. >> Randy and I needed to win.
537,00:29:21.25,00:29:21.25,"Now, I'm going on a wing and a prayer that Bob has the idol."
538,00:29:24.08,00:29:24.08,I just need to figure out if he has it or not.
539,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,I was so close. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
540,00:29:45.25,00:29:45.25,>> I can't believe it. >> I can.
541,00:29:47.08,00:29:47.08,"It's awesome! >> Hey, Kenny, good job."
542,00:29:49.04,00:29:49.04,"Very good job. >> Yeah, thanks, guys."
543,00:29:51.29,00:29:51.29,">> Good job, bro. >> Matty was like so close, too."
544,00:29:54.08,00:29:54.08,That was insane. >> I am 75% sure that I need the
545,00:29:59.71,00:29:59.71,idol tonight because they're going to vote for me.
546,00:30:03.12,00:30:03.12,"Ideally, tonight, Bob gives me the idol, and whoever Corinne,"
547,00:30:07.38,00:30:07.38,"Bob, and I decide to send home will be going home."
548,00:30:11.29,00:30:11.29,"Right now, it looks like Susie. >> Okay."
549,00:30:17.38,00:30:17.38,"Well, I... that's what I kind of feel like now, too."
550,00:30:20.12,00:30:20.12,>> I really would feel guilty if Bob went home and I stayed.
551,00:30:22.50,00:30:22.50,"But if he even semi-offers it, I'm going to take it."
552,00:30:32.25,00:30:32.25,>> I know you guys aren't going to believe me if I tell you I
553,00:30:34.42,00:30:34.42,don't have the idol. And you-you have to...
554,00:30:36.42,00:30:36.42,>> It wouldn't matter. I do believe you.
555,00:30:38.46,00:30:38.46,I have your best interests in mind.
556,00:30:40.71,00:30:40.71,"Um, you can vote for whoever you want, but it might behoove you"
557,00:30:43.71,00:30:43.71,to vote against Randy. >> We don't need him here.
558,00:30:46.38,00:30:46.38,">> Yeah, I know. And it might buy you some time,"
559,00:30:48.92,00:30:48.92,"and if it doesn't buy you some time, I got another plan."
560,00:30:53.17,00:30:53.17,"Randy is an ass, and I loathe him with every inch of my being."
561,00:30:56.67,00:30:56.67,">> Thanks, sweetie. Bye. >> Bye."
562,00:30:58.67,00:30:58.67,The guy is a bigot. He offends everyone.
563,00:31:01.17,00:31:01.17,"And maybe that's his game, but I'm not even worried about that"
564,00:31:03.75,00:31:03.75,because Randy's gone. You didn't tell anybody that
565,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,"you didn't find it, right? I think that Randy would fall"
566,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,for it. Your idol.
567,00:31:18.62,00:31:18.62,>> If I give him the fake one? >> And it... it would be
568,00:31:22.88,00:31:22.88,hilarious. >> If you think he'd fall for
569,00:31:25.17,00:31:25.17,"it, but I just, you know... >> Yeah, don't worry."
570,00:31:27.21,00:31:27.21,">> If we figure out a way for me to give it to Randy, I will do"
571,00:31:30.21,00:31:30.21,that. Sugar wants to play the joke on
572,00:31:32.04,00:31:32.04,Randy. My life expectancy is a little
573,00:31:35.88,00:31:35.88,bit better off allowing her to have the satisfaction of me
574,00:31:39.00,00:31:39.00,giving Randy the-the idol. I've got nothing to lose.
575,00:31:42.38,00:31:42.38,It's not a real idol. I can't save myself with it.
576,00:31:45.29,00:31:45.29,The only way I can save myself for another Tribal Council is by
577,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,"convincing somebody else to use it, and I think it should do the"
578,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,trick. >> I want to run through the
579,00:31:59.25,00:31:59.25,"options with you. Okay, obviously, the only Hail"
580,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,"Mary we've got is the idol, which I assume you found."
581,00:32:04.50,00:32:04.50,Okay. And you know you cannot tell
582,00:32:06.79,00:32:06.79,"anybody you found the idol, at all."
583,00:32:09.08,00:32:09.08,"Other than me or Randy, you cannot trust anybody, especially"
584,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"not Sugar. Obviously, if you found the"
585,00:32:13.17,00:32:13.17,"idol, the smartest strategy would be to give it to Randy"
586,00:32:15.17,00:32:15.17,if you thought that Randy was getting voted out 'cause it
587,00:32:16.96,00:32:16.96,"would save us. >> If at the end of the day, I"
588,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,think they're going to go for Randy...
589,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,>> You're going to give it for Randy.
590,00:32:22.67,00:32:22.67,>> I'm going to give it to Randy and the three of us vote for
591,00:32:24.67,00:32:24.67,"Susie. >> Yeah, no matter what, the"
592,00:32:26.46,00:32:26.46,three of us vote for Susie. I love you.
593,00:32:28.25,00:32:28.25,Thank you for coming back. And thank you for finding the
594,00:32:29.79,00:32:29.79,idol. >> That was...
595,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,>> I'm trying to figure out what to do.
596,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,What I'm thinking is you've pissed everybody off so much...
597,00:32:55.96,00:32:55.96,>> I'm going tonight. >> If I gave you that idol...
598,00:33:03.46,00:33:03.46,">> Bob has not only told me that he has the idol, but he showed"
599,00:33:06.46,00:33:06.46,it to me. I saw it.
600,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,It was two feet away from me. I am thrilled that Bob found
601,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,the idol. I'm especially thrilled that
602,00:33:13.29,00:33:13.29,he's willing to give it over to me.
603,00:33:17.83,00:33:17.83,">> The hit is on Susie. >> Susie, yeah."
604,00:33:21.71,00:33:21.71,">> Make sure Corinne and-and... all I can offer you now is, if"
605,00:33:24.83,00:33:24.83,"you're in the finals and I'm not, you got my vote for a"
606,00:33:27.25,00:33:27.25,million. >> Save some starch for me when
607,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,we... >> It's a deal.
608,00:33:33.96,00:33:33.96,"We got word that the hit is on, on me tonight, so Bob did one of"
609,00:33:38.71,00:33:38.71,"the most, uh, selfless acts I've ever seen, which was, uh, to"
610,00:33:42.88,00:33:42.88,give me his hidden immunity idol.
611,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,"There is going to be some surprised people tonight, I"
612,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,"think, and I'm here for three more days."
613,00:33:49.00,00:33:49.00,Looks like an idol to me. >> You're a genius.
614,00:33:53.71,00:33:53.71,I cannot believe you did that. I cannot wait to see this.
615,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,You are awesome. Thank you.
616,00:34:00.08,00:34:00.08,">> Make it worth my while. >> Oh, I will."
617,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,Don't worry. I'm making it worth your while.
618,00:34:04.25,00:34:04.25,"You kick butt, dude. (laughing)"
619,00:34:42.67,00:34:42.67,>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the members of our jury.
620,00:34:48.12,00:34:48.12,"Marcus and Charlie, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
621,00:34:58.29,00:34:58.29,Let's start with the auction. It ended with what should have
622,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,been a happy note. Randy buys a plate of chocolate
623,00:35:04.75,00:35:04.75,"chip cookies for the tribe, but it didn't go down so smoothly."
624,00:35:08.42,00:35:08.42,"Sugar, what was your take on how it all played out?"
625,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,">> Well, Randy offered me his last cookie, which I wasn't"
626,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,really thinking about it being his last cookie.
627,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,"I just thought that they were for the tribe, and so I took it,"
628,00:35:18.79,00:35:18.79,"and I gave it to Matty, and we've heard about it for three"
629,00:35:21.25,00:35:21.25,"days. >> PROBST: Randy, looking back"
630,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"on your actions, did you play it the right way?"
631,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,Was that appropriate? >> It wasn't the last cookie.
632,00:35:28.25,00:35:28.25,"It was my cookie. And honestly, I was testing her."
633,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,I could have thrown them on the ground and stomped on them if I
634,00:35:33.25,00:35:33.25,"wanted to, or I could have been generous like I was."
635,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,>> PROBST: So you think their reaction was maybe a little
636,00:35:39.29,00:35:39.29,harsh because you did offer everybody a cookie?
637,00:35:41.58,00:35:41.58,">> Yes, and I even offered Sugar one twice."
638,00:35:44.96,00:35:44.96,">> It's freaking cookies. My God, we're grown-ups."
639,00:35:47.92,00:35:47.92,"It's stupid. >> PROBST: Susie, why is this"
640,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,seemingly funny story about a cookie so representative of this
641,00:35:54.71,00:35:54.71,game? >> You're really getting to know
642,00:35:57.00,00:35:57.00,people's true colors and what they're really like 'cause I
643,00:35:59.12,00:35:59.12,"have actually questioned, thinking, ""God, you know, is"
644,00:36:01.25,00:36:01.25,"Randy really like this?"" He's actually probably a person"
645,00:36:04.96,00:36:04.96,that's really hurting. I feel kind of sorry for him
646,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,"because he probably is very sad. >> You know, actually, saying ""I"
647,00:36:10.71,00:36:10.71,"feel sorry"" for somebody is another way of saying, ""How"
648,00:36:14.62,00:36:14.62,"pathetic."" >> Oh, my apologies."
649,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,I don't mean it that way. >> And I was totally sincere
650,00:36:20.04,00:36:20.04,"with the cookie, too. I swear I was."
651,00:36:22.88,00:36:22.88,That's why I went off today. So...
652,00:36:25.42,00:36:25.42,">> PROBST: Corinne, it sounds like something happened at camp"
653,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,today. Randy says he went off.
654,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,What happened? >> I don't even know what
655,00:36:31.62,00:36:31.62,"started it, but all of a sudden, I hear something to the effect"
656,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,"of, ""Shut up,"" directed from Randy at Susie."
657,00:36:39.79,00:36:39.79,And it's a very awkward thing to be sitting through.
658,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,">> PROBST: Crystal, can you feel the tension ramping up as we get"
659,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,into the very tail end of this game?
660,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,>> I sure can feel the tension ramping up.
661,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,"Like, for instance, the cookie conversation that exploded into"
662,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,"a blatant disrespect to a grown woman... to me, under any other"
663,00:36:58.04,00:36:58.04,"circumstances, that's hands down for a slap."
664,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,>> PROBST: Is there any chance that Randy's playing some sort
665,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"of game? >> If-if... if this is him, then"
666,00:37:07.46,00:37:07.46,he's giving it to me raw. And I will never talk to him
667,00:37:11.58,00:37:11.58,outside of this situation. But if this is his game and no
668,00:37:14.67,00:37:14.67,one's going to possibly reject me and I'm going to get to the
669,00:37:18.54,00:37:18.54,"end, then that's his game. >> PROBST: Bob, let's talk about"
670,00:37:23.17,00:37:23.17,your second trip to Exile Island.
671,00:37:26.08,00:37:26.08,Is anybody brave enough to bring up the notion of the hidden
672,00:37:29.25,00:37:29.25,"immunity idol? >> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah."
673,00:37:32.17,00:37:32.17,I made a point of not letting people know for sure whether I
674,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,had it or I didn't have it because it's part of the game.
675,00:37:39.71,00:37:39.71,"And I'm here to play. >> PROBST: Randy, I know you're"
676,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"worried every time you come to Tribal, but with so much"
677,00:37:46.54,00:37:46.54,"animosity directed toward you, how worried are you tonight?"
678,00:37:50.46,00:37:50.46,>> You're wrong about one thing. I haven't been worried every
679,00:37:53.08,00:37:53.08,"time I come to Tribal. And I am a bit worried tonight,"
680,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,though. You're right about that.
681,00:37:56.96,00:37:56.96,But 30 days is a pretty good run.
682,00:37:59.38,00:37:59.38,">> PROBST: So, if it's you tonight, you're okay with that?"
683,00:38:02.58,00:38:02.58,">> No, I would not be okay with leaving."
684,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,"I want to stay. >> PROBST: With that, it is time"
685,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"to get to the vote. Kenny, you have the individual"
686,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,immunity necklace. You can keep it for yourself or
687,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,"give it to somebody else. >> I will keep it tonight, Jeff."
688,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Kenny.
689,00:38:19.42,00:38:19.42,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
690,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,"Matty, you're up. >> I'm voting you, Susie,"
691,00:38:37.29,00:38:37.29,"'cause payback's a bitch. >> You are a disgusting, old,"
692,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,"hotheaded, chauvinistic, alcoholic bigot, and you need to"
693,00:38:57.04,00:38:57.04,grow up before you die alone. And a loser.
694,00:39:11.50,00:39:11.50,>> This vote is not strategic. It's strictly personal.
695,00:39:25.25,00:39:25.25,>> (loudly): You have made my life hell from day one!
696,00:39:30.12,00:39:30.12,Forget you! Go home!
697,00:39:33.33,00:39:33.33,Good-bye. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
698,00:39:44.96,00:39:44.96,votes. If anybody has the hidden
699,00:39:59.75,00:39:59.75,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
700,00:40:02.17,00:40:02.17,to do so. >> PROBST: Thank you.
701,00:40:27.33,00:40:27.33,The rules of Survivor state that if a hidden immunity idol is
702,00:40:31.67,00:40:31.67,"played, then the votes cast against that person will not"
703,00:40:35.75,00:40:35.75,"count, and the person with the next highest number of votes"
704,00:40:38.42,00:40:38.42,will be voted out. This is not a hidden immunity
705,00:40:47.25,00:40:47.25,idol. (laughing)
706,00:40:54.08,00:40:54.08,All votes cast against Randy will count.
707,00:41:02.38,00:41:02.38,I'll now read the votes. First vote... Randy.
708,00:41:14.88,00:41:14.88,Randy-- two votes Randy. Susie.
709,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,Susie. Two votes Randy;
710,00:41:28.71,00:41:28.71,two votes Susie. That's three votes Susie;
711,00:41:34.25,00:41:34.25,two votes Randy. Randy.
712,00:41:40.21,00:41:40.21,That's three votes Randy; three votes Susie.
713,00:41:46.17,00:41:46.17,Randy. That's four votes Randy;
714,00:41:48.58,00:41:48.58,three votes Susie. One vote left.
715,00:41:55.92,00:41:55.92,"11th person voted out of Survivor: Gabon, and the third"
716,00:41:58.42,00:41:58.42,member of our jury: Randy. Need to bring me your torch.
717,00:42:10.08,00:42:10.08,"Randy, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
718,00:42:27.17,00:42:27.17,"Well, after tonight's Tribal Council, it's very clear this"
719,00:42:30.29,00:42:30.29,game is coming down to one thing: trust.
720,00:42:33.25,00:42:33.25,Can't wait to see how it plays out.
721,00:42:35.71,00:42:35.71,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
