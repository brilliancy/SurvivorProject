384,00:20:11.08,00:20:11.08,>> That's a great plan.>> We get the feeling that Bob

386,00:20:16.58,00:20:16.58,convince Bob to give me thehidden immunity idol.
387,00:20:20.75,00:20:20.75,"I play the idol.Voilà-- Susie, joke's on you."

397,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,The reason that myself andCorinne and Bob are in the
398,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,predicament we are in is becauseSusie flipped.
399,00:20:49.33,00:20:49.33,"She went with Crystal and Kenny,and they voted Marcus out."
400,00:20:53.25,00:20:53.25,"That's part of the game, but thehell with her."

419,00:21:58.08,00:21:58.08,"could do anything-- I could putit in the dirt and stomp on it,"
420,00:22:01.17,00:22:01.17,if I wanted to.>> I got the impression that you
421,00:22:03.46,00:22:03.46,really didn't want to give it...>> To anybody.
422,00:22:05.79,00:22:05.79,>> I'm tired of this story.>> Thank you.

563,00:31:03.75,00:31:03.75,because Randy's gone.You didn't tell anybody that
564,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,"you didn't find it, right?I think that Randy would fall"
565,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,for it.Your idol.
566,00:31:18.62,00:31:18.62,>> If I give him the fake one?>> And it... it would be
567,00:31:22.88,00:31:22.88,hilarious.>> If you think he'd fall for

570,00:31:30.21,00:31:30.21,that.Sugar wants to play the joke on
571,00:31:32.04,00:31:32.04,Randy.My life expectancy is a little
572,00:31:35.88,00:31:35.88,bit better off allowing her tohave the satisfaction of me
573,00:31:39.00,00:31:39.00,giving Randy the-the idol.I've got nothing to lose.
574,00:31:42.38,00:31:42.38,It's not a real idol.I can't save myself with it.
575,00:31:45.29,00:31:45.29,The only way I can save myselffor another Tribal Council is by
576,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,"convincing somebody else to useit, and I think it should do the"
577,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,trick.>> I want to run through the

580,00:32:04.50,00:32:04.50,Okay.And you know you cannot tell
581,00:32:06.79,00:32:06.79,"anybody you found the idol, atall."
582,00:32:09.08,00:32:09.08,"Other than me or Randy, youcannot trust anybody, especially"
583,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"not Sugar.Obviously, if you found the"
584,00:32:13.17,00:32:13.17,"idol, the smartest strategywould be to give it to Randy"
585,00:32:15.17,00:32:15.17,if you thought that Randy wasgetting voted out 'cause it
586,00:32:16.96,00:32:16.96,"would save us.>> If at the end of the day, I"
587,00:32:18.88,00:32:18.88,think they're going to go forRandy...
588,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,>> You're going to give it forRandy.

595,00:32:51.12,00:32:51.12,What I'm thinking is you'vepissed everybody off so much...
596,00:32:55.96,00:32:55.96,>> I'm going tonight.>> If I gave you that idol...
597,00:33:03.46,00:33:03.46,">> Bob has not only told me thathe has the idol, but he showed"

599,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,It was two feet away from me.I am thrilled that Bob found
600,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,the idol.I'm especially thrilled that
601,00:33:13.29,00:33:13.29,he's willing to give it over tome.

607,00:33:33.96,00:33:33.96,"We got word that the hit is on,on me tonight, so Bob did one of"

612,00:33:49.00,00:33:49.00,Looks like an idol to me.>> You're a genius.
613,00:33:53.71,00:33:53.71,I cannot believe you did that.I cannot wait to see this.
614,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,You are awesome.Thank you.
615,00:34:00.08,00:34:00.08,">> Make it worth my while.>> Oh, I will."
616,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,Don't worry.I'm making it worth your while.
617,00:34:04.25,00:34:04.25,"You kick butt, dude.(laughing)"

620,00:34:58.29,00:34:58.29,Let's start with the auction.It ended with what should have
621,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,been a happy note.Randy buys a plate of chocolate
622,00:35:04.75,00:35:04.75,"chip cookies for the tribe, butit didn't go down so smoothly."
623,00:35:08.42,00:35:08.42,"Sugar, what was your take onhow it all played out?"
624,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,">> Well, Randy offered me hislast cookie, which I wasn't"
625,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,really thinking about it beinghis last cookie.
626,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,"I just thought that they werefor the tribe, and so I took it,"
627,00:35:18.79,00:35:18.79,"and I gave it to Matty, andwe've heard about it for three"
628,00:35:21.25,00:35:21.25,"days.>> PROBST: Randy, looking back"
629,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"on your actions, did you play itthe right way?"
630,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,Was that appropriate?>> It wasn't the last cookie.
631,00:35:28.25,00:35:28.25,"It was my cookie.And honestly, I was testing her."
632,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,I could have thrown them on theground and stomped on them if I
633,00:35:33.25,00:35:33.25,"wanted to, or I could have beengenerous like I was."
634,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,>> PROBST: So you think theirreaction was maybe a little
635,00:35:39.29,00:35:39.29,harsh because you did offereverybody a cookie?
636,00:35:41.58,00:35:41.58,">> Yes, and I even offered Sugarone twice."
637,00:35:44.96,00:35:44.96,">> It's freaking cookies.My God, we're grown-ups."

639,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,seemingly funny story about acookie so representative of this
640,00:35:54.71,00:35:54.71,game?>> You're really getting to know
641,00:35:57.00,00:35:57.00,people's true colors and whatthey're really like 'cause I

645,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,"because he probably is very sad.>> You know, actually, saying ""I"
646,00:36:10.71,00:36:10.71,"feel sorry"" for somebody isanother way of saying, ""How"
647,00:36:14.62,00:36:14.62,"pathetic."">> Oh, my apologies."
648,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,I don't mean it that way.>> And I was totally sincere

650,00:36:22.88,00:36:22.88,That's why I went off today.So...

654,00:36:31.62,00:36:31.62,"started it, but all of a sudden,I hear something to the effect"
655,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,"of, ""Shut up,"" directed fromRandy at Susie."
656,00:36:39.79,00:36:39.79,And it's a very awkward thingto be sitting through.

660,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,"Like, for instance, the cookieconversation that exploded into"

666,00:37:11.58,00:37:11.58,outside of this situation.But if this is his game and no
667,00:37:14.67,00:37:14.67,one's going to possibly rejectme and I'm going to get to the
668,00:37:18.54,00:37:18.54,"end, then that's his game.>> PROBST: Bob, let's talk about"

672,00:37:32.17,00:37:32.17,I made a point of not lettingpeople know for sure whether I
673,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,had it or I didn't have itbecause it's part of the game.
674,00:37:39.71,00:37:39.71,"And I'm here to play.>> PROBST: Randy, I know you're"
675,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"worried every time you come toTribal, but with so much"
676,00:37:46.54,00:37:46.54,"animosity directed toward you,how worried are you tonight?"
677,00:37:50.46,00:37:50.46,>> You're wrong about one thing.I haven't been worried every

679,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,though.You're right about that.
680,00:37:56.96,00:37:56.96,But 30 days is a pretty goodrun.
