220,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,"OFF THIS BABY. MAP, I'VE BEEN REJUVENATED."
221,00:15:36.13,00:15:36.13,"I HAVE FOUR, FIVE, SIX DAYS LEFT."

233,00:16:23.50,00:16:23.50,CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING

238,00:16:38.67,00:16:38.67,">> WELL, MAYBE SHE WANTS A GOOD PAIR."
239,00:16:41.50,00:16:41.50,MAYBE SHE TRUSTS KEITH MORE THAN ALEC.
240,00:16:46.57,00:16:46.57,MAYBE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE AND LIED ABOUT IT.
241,00:16:52.03,00:16:52.03,KEITH IS FREAKISHLY GOOD AT THESE CHALLENGES.
242,00:16:54.93,00:16:54.93,"SO IF KEITH KEEPS WINNING IMMUNITY, THEN I THINK THAT"
243,00:16:57.83,00:16:57.83,EVERYBODY WILL GET EVEN MORE MAD AT NATALIE FOR SCREWING UP THAT
244,00:17:01.67,00:17:01.67,VOTE. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO BREAK UP THE
245,00:17:03.53,00:17:03.53,"FIVE SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT. >> I VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO EXILE,"
246,00:17:20.93,00:17:20.93,"BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, WHEN YOUR BODY IS ALREADY SO"
247,00:17:24.40,00:17:24.40,DRAINED AND IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE END YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE IT BUT
248,00:17:27.13,00:17:27.13,"YOU'RE NOT THERE YET, IT'S BEEN REALLY DEPRESSING ME OUT HERE."
249,00:17:31.87,00:17:31.87,IT'S BEEN REALLY A ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTION FOR ME
250,00:17:34.93,00:17:34.93,BECAUSE THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE GONE WITHOUT SEEING OR TALKING
251,00:17:37.33,00:17:37.33,TO MY SISTER. I'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 28 YEARS.
252,00:17:44.40,00:17:44.40,I'VE NEVER LET ANYBODY SEE HOW MUCH I MISS HER.
253,00:17:46.60,00:17:46.60,"AND I KIND OF ALWAYS JUST PRETEND LIKE I'M FINE, BUT"
254,00:17:52.40,00:17:52.40,"NADIYA'S BEEN GONE FOR LIKE 30 DAYS NOW, AND I HAVE BEEN DOING"
255,00:17:57.50,00:17:57.50,"THIS WITHOUT HER, BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING"
256,00:18:01.33,00:18:01.33,WHERE I CAN USE IT AS MOTIVATION INSTEAD OF JUST BRINGING ME
257,00:18:04.10,00:18:04.10,"DOWN. TIME TO, YOU KNOW, BUCK UP AND"
258,00:18:08.07,00:18:08.07,MAKE EVERY DECISION MOVING FORWARD COUNT.
259,00:18:11.20,00:18:11.20,I HAVE ONE SHOT TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I LEFT EVERYTHING ON
260,00:18:15.27,00:18:15.27,THE TABLE. MAKE THESE LAST FOUR DAYS FULLY
261,00:18:18.53,00:18:18.53,"WORTH IT. >> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS."
262,00:18:54.57,00:18:54.57,CLEARLY WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
263,00:18:56.03,00:18:56.03,"LET'S GET NATALIE IN HERE, RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND."
264,00:19:02.77,00:19:02.77,">> HEY, GIRL. >> YEAH."

267,00:19:28.07,00:19:28.07,IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS I EVER HAD TO DO.
268,00:19:32.00,00:19:32.00,I CRIED PROBABLY 50% OF THE DAY. IT WAS EXHAUSTING EMOTIONALLY
269,00:19:37.20,00:19:37.20,"AND PHYSICALLY TO ME. >> Jeff: MISSY, LAST I SAW"
270,00:19:41.60,00:19:41.60,"YOU, BAYLOR WAS CARRYING YOU OUT ON YOUR BACK."
271,00:19:44.10,00:19:44.10,CLEARLY THE ANKLE HAS GOTTEN WORSE.
272,00:19:46.00,00:19:46.00,>> UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING WORSE.
273,00:19:51.50,00:19:51.50,BUT I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT. THERE'S NO WAY.
274,00:19:58.47,00:19:58.47,"I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS, BUT I'M GOING"
275,00:20:03.17,00:20:03.17,TO TRY THE STAND ON ONE FOOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
276,00:20:05.90,00:20:05.90,>> Jeff: I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MEDICAL LOOK AT IT BEFORE

280,00:20:15.07,00:20:15.07,SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING MEDICAL IN.
281,00:20:16.60,00:20:16.60,>> ALL RIGHT. >> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

303,00:21:36.17,00:21:36.17,>> Jeff: OKAY. THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE
304,00:21:38.43,00:21:38.43,"THAT THIS IS BROKEN IS TO DO AN X-RAY, AND TO DO AN X-RAY, I'D"
305,00:21:41.93,00:21:41.93,HAVE TO PULL MISSY FROM THE GAME.
306,00:21:47.27,00:21:47.27,[SOBBING] >> IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

312,00:22:29.47,00:22:29.47,THINK SHE NEEDS TO BE PULLED FROM THE GAME.
313,00:22:33.60,00:22:33.60,JEFF JEFF CLEARLY SHE'S IN PAIN. IT'S NOT LIFE-THREATENING.
314,00:22:36.00,00:22:36.00,"SO AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, IT'S HER CALL WHAT SHE DOES IN"

365,00:26:15.07,00:26:15.07,ESPECIALLY AS YOUR FEET BECOME NUMB AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
366,00:26:18.77,00:26:18.77,THEY'RE DOING ANYMORE. KEITH WOBBLING AGAIN.
367,00:26:26.03,00:26:26.03,BAY ALREADY'S VASE IS ALSO MOVING.
368,00:26:31.50,00:26:31.50,BAYLOR CANNOT RECOVER. BAYLOR IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
369,00:26:36.57,00:26:36.57,"WE'RE NOW DOWN TO THREE, AND HERE COMES A HUGE GUST OF WIND."

371,00:27:02.30,00:27:02.30,THAT WIND. YOUR FEET ARE NUMB.
372,00:27:04.23,00:27:04.23,THE WIND IS BLOWING. WHO CAN HANG THIS THERE THE
373,00:27:09.13,00:27:09.13,LONGEST? WHO WANTS THIS THE MOST?
374,00:27:34.90,00:27:34.90,HERE COMES THE WIND AGAIN. BRACE YOURSELF.
375,00:27:40.00,00:27:40.00,BIG WIND. THE WIND IS TOO MUCH FOR KEITH.
376,00:27:52.87,00:27:52.87,WE'RE DOWN TO TWO. IT IS NATALIE AND JON FIGHTING
377,00:27:56.80,00:27:56.80,"FOR IMMUNITY ON DAY 35, AND IT GUARANTEES A SPOT IN THE FINAL"
378,00:28:00.87,00:28:00.87,FIVE. YOU DO NOT WANT TO RISK BEING
379,00:28:03.87,00:28:03.87,VOTED OUT TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
380,00:28:06.73,00:28:06.73,THIS IS IT. YOU GOT TO WIN IT RIGHT HERE.
381,00:28:17.80,00:28:17.80,WIND UP AGAIN. MAKING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT
382,00:28:26.93,00:28:26.93,CHALLENGE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE.
383,00:28:29.90,00:28:29.90,"OUT OF NOWHERE, MOTHER NATURE IS SAYING HELLO."
384,00:28:51.00,00:28:51.00,AND JUST LIKE THAT JON DROPS. NATALIE WINS INDIVIDUAL
385,00:28:58.13,00:28:58.13,"IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL FIVE."
386,00:29:04.30,00:29:04.30,>> THAT WAS QUICK. >> I DIDN'T EVEN MOVE IT.
387,00:29:06.93,00:29:06.93,">> GOOD JOB. >> GOOD JOB, NAT."

392,00:29:28.73,00:29:28.73,SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME TONIGHT. YOU WILL BECOME THE SIXTH MEMBER

397,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,UP THE LAST VOTE. SO THE PLAN IS TO DO WHAT WE
398,00:29:47.90,00:29:47.90,TRIED TO DO LAST TRIBAL AND GET KEITH OUT.
399,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,">> THANK YOU, KEITH. YOU'RE A LIFESAVER."
400,00:30:10.07,00:30:10.07,>> THE FACT MISSY HAD TO SIT OUT TODAY I'M SURE WAS EXCRUCIATING
401,00:30:14.03,00:30:14.03,FOR HER AND PROBABLY JUST AS BAD AS THE PAIN SHE WAS FEELING.
402,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,"HOW YOU FEELING, MISS? >> I DON'T KNOW YET."
403,00:30:20.37,00:30:20.37,>> HOW THE CHALLENGE ENDED UP WAS VERY FRUSTRATING.

413,00:30:50.27,00:30:50.27,">> BUT JON HAS AN IDOL, SO I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY."
414,00:30:54.67,00:30:54.67,MY ULTIMATE PLAN IS TO SPLIT THE VOTE AND BLINDSIDE JON TONIGHT.
415,00:31:00.30,00:31:00.30,TONIGHT JUST VOTE JON. I'LL TELL YOU.
416,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,"THE PLAN IS TO SPLIT VOTES. IF JON PLAYS HIS IDOL, WE VOTE"
417,00:31:09.53,00:31:09.53,OUT JACLYN. GETTING OUT JON WOULD BE A DREAM
418,00:31:11.50,00:31:11.50,COME TRUE. >> IT'S TRIBAL TONIGHT.
419,00:31:12.97,00:31:12.97,"IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED, MR. ALL-AMERICAN OR MISS U.S.A."
420,00:31:16.60,00:31:16.60,IS GOING HOME. AND I'LL BE SITTING HERE WITH
421,00:31:18.83,00:31:18.83,FIVE. >> THAT'S THE PLAN.

428,00:31:40.07,00:31:40.07,>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I THINK IF THEY WERE GOING FOR
429,00:31:44.77,00:31:44.77,"KEITH LAST TIME, THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR KEITH AGAIN."

433,00:31:58.67,00:31:58.67,"COULD JON GO HOME TONIGHT? YOU NEVER KNOW 100%, BUT AT"
434,00:32:02.83,00:32:02.83,"LEAST JON STILL HAS HIS IDOL. >> I KNOW I'M BEING PARANOID,"
435,00:32:07.37,00:32:07.37,BUT I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BLINDSIDE JON.

445,00:32:43.20,00:32:43.20,SHE'LL WRITE HIS NAME DOWN. IT JUST REALLY DEPENDS ON MY

468,00:33:49.40,00:33:49.40,DON'T. I SAY WE VOTE OUT JON TONIGHT.

475,00:34:15.80,00:34:15.80,"JON-JACLYN SHOW MAY NEED TO COME TO AN END, ABSOLUTELY, BUT IT'S"
476,00:34:19.93,00:34:19.93,IMPORTANT FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE I PLAYED THIS GAME TRUTHFULLY.

478,00:34:26.50,00:34:26.50,LIED IN THEIR FACES. I HAVEN'T.
479,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT THIS IS THE
480,00:34:32.47,00:34:32.47,FIRST TIME I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME WITH IT.

491,00:35:30.60,00:35:30.60,WOULD BE A BIG MOVE. AND BIG MOVES MEANS YOUR PLAYING
492,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,THE GAME AND PLAYING THE GAME GETS YOU VOTES.
493,00:35:36.27,00:35:36.27,>> Jeff: SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE ON TO

498,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,FEELING LIKE WE CAN TRUST KEITH. IT'S THAT WE'VE BUILT THIS TRUST
499,00:35:55.77,00:35:55.77,WITH OUR GROUP OF FIVE. I DON'T WANT TO LET THIS GROUP
500,00:35:59.27,00:35:59.27,OF FIVE DOWN. I WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL IF I
501,00:36:03.37,00:36:03.37,PEKO TO TRUST THEM IF THEY CAN'T TRUST ME.
502,00:36:05.57,00:36:05.57,">> Jeff: JACLYN, IS THERE ANY ARGUMENT THAT KEITH CAN MAKE"

505,00:36:14.70,00:36:14.70,"CAN SAY, THOUGH, IS THAT I FEEL STRONG IN THE FIVE."
506,00:36:18.50,00:36:18.50,SO I DON'T THINK JON ANDRY GOING ANYWHERE.
507,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,>> Jeff: NATALIE. YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS
508,00:36:26.67,00:36:26.67,FIVE IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LOVED ONE IN THE GAME.
509,00:36:29.80,00:36:29.80,WHICH AT A CERTAIN POINT WOULD MAKE YOU VERY VALUABLE.
510,00:36:32.10,00:36:32.10,">> YEAH, BLOOD IS REALLY, REALLY THICK."
511,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,"IT'S HARDER TO PENETRATE IT AND SAY, COME ON, LET'S DO"
512,00:36:39.93,00:36:39.93,SOMETHING. I HAVE BEEN GONE FOR TWO DAYS AT

519,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,THINK. HAVING THE LOYALTY AND HAVING
520,00:37:08.73,00:37:08.73,THE TRUST AND BUILDING THAT TRUST THROUGHOUT THE GAME IS
521,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST RARE THINGS YOU CAN FIND IN
522,00:37:13.10,00:37:13.10,"""SURVIVOR."" >> Jeff: SO MISSY, AS JON"

530,00:37:38.23,00:37:38.23,SOMEBODY THAT COULD COME ALONG AND POTENTIALLY BREAK UP THE
531,00:37:41.20,00:37:41.20,ALLIANZ? SURE.
532,00:37:42.10,00:37:42.10,"THAT SCENARIO COULD BE A BIG MOVE, BUT I'M PRETTY LOYAL TO A"

538,00:38:45.27,00:38:45.27,"IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
539,00:38:57.97,00:38:57.97,"OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
