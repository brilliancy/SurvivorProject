422,00:15:12.54,00:15:12.54,THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO IS
423,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,TO SPLIT THE TWO OF THEM UP.
424,00:15:15.29,00:15:15.29,>> HE'S NUTS.

455,00:16:06.21,00:16:06.21,"LIKE, I KNOW AND ASHLEY HAVE"
456,00:16:07.92,00:16:07.92,BEEN FRIENDS THIS WHOLE GAME.
457,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,I PROMISE YOU I WILL GET YOU TOTHE END.
458,00:16:12.08,00:16:12.08,I PROMISE YOU.

460,00:16:16.21,00:16:16.21,WE'VE STUCK TOGETHER SINCE THEBEGINNING.
461,00:16:17.62,00:16:17.62,AND THE THING WITH NATALIE IS
462,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,SHE'S REALLY RELYING ON ROB ALOT.
463,00:16:20.79,00:16:20.79,"AND I RELY ON ROB, BUT I ALSO"
464,00:16:22.75,00:16:22.75,KNOW THAT HE'S PLAYING THE GAME.
465,00:16:25.54,00:16:25.54,AND I WOULD BET MY LIFE IF IT
466,00:16:27.71,00:16:27.71,"CAME DOWN TO GRANT, ME, NATALIE,"
467,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,"AND ROB IN THE FOUR, THAT ROB"
468,00:16:33.12,00:16:33.12,WOULD VOTE ONE OF US GIRLS OUT
469,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,IN A HEARTBEAT.
470,00:16:35.46,00:16:35.46,SO I THINK THE BEST PLAY FOR ME
471,00:16:37.38,00:16:37.38,IN THIS GAME IS TO JUST GET A
472,00:16:40.12,00:16:40.12,BIG MOVE GOING HERE AND GET RID
473,00:16:42.08,00:16:42.08,OF A STRONG COMPETITOR.
474,00:16:52.08,00:16:52.08,>> WE WERE JUST THINKING THAT IT
475,00:16:54.29,00:16:54.29,MIGHT BE SMARTER TO SEND GRANT

480,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,ABOUT GETTING RID OF MIKEAND HIM.
481,00:17:05.71,00:17:05.71,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
482,00:17:07.92,00:17:07.92,>> DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DEALWITH PHILLIP?
483,00:17:11.88,00:17:11.88,>> NO. I DON'T WANT TO KEEPPHILLIP AROUND.
484,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,I JUST WANT TO DO WHAT'S THE
485,00:17:15.38,00:17:15.38,SMARTEST TO KEEP US THREETOGETHER.
486,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,>> IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHINGTO CONSIDER.
487,00:17:21.12,00:17:21.12,LET'S JUST SLEEP ON IT AND SEE
488,00:17:22.42,00:17:22.42,WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW.

492,00:17:29.58,00:17:29.58,I'VE ALREADY RUN THE NUMBERS ON
493,00:17:31.42,00:17:31.42,THIS SCENARIO WEEKS AGO.
494,00:17:32.25,00:17:32.25,IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
495,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,ALL IT DOES IS GIVE ASHLEY
496,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,ANOTHER WAY CLOSER TO SQUEEZING
497,00:17:37.62,00:17:37.62,HERSELF INTO THE FINALS.
498,00:17:43.21,00:17:43.21,"SHE'S NO GOOD, BRO."
499,00:17:44.42,00:17:44.42,SHE WANTS YOU GONE.
