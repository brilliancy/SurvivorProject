411,00:14:52.25,00:14:52.25,>> I TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO BOTH OF THEM.
412,00:14:53.25,00:14:53.25,">> YOU EXPLAINED NOTHING, PHILLIP."
413,00:14:54.25,00:14:54.25,>> PSYCHO!
414,00:14:55.25,00:14:55.25,>> LIKE YOU.
415,00:14:56.25,00:14:56.25,>> HE'S PATHETIC.
416,00:14:57.25,00:14:57.25,AND HE'S CRAZY.
417,00:14:59.96,00:14:59.96,"NOT THE ""N"" WORD CRAZY. HE'S JUST CRAZY."
418,00:15:04.12,00:15:04.12,">> YOU'RE A LITTLE PRINCESS, GO GET ON YOUR PAGEANT."
419,00:15:06.50,00:15:06.50,>> PSYCHO!
420,00:15:07.42,00:15:07.42,>> GO GET ON MISS U.S.A.
421,00:15:08.46,00:15:08.46,>> ASHLEY AND NATALIE ARE
422,00:15:10.83,00:15:10.83,GETTING TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.
423,00:15:12.54,00:15:12.54,THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO IS
424,00:15:14.08,00:15:14.08,TO SPLIT THE TWO OF THEM UP.
425,00:15:15.29,00:15:15.29,>> HE'S NUTS.
426,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,">> SO INSTEAD OF, LIKE, PICKING ON ONE OF THEM,"
427,00:15:19.25,00:15:19.25,HE PICKS ON BOTH OF THEM.
428,00:15:20.67,00:15:20.67,"INSTEAD OF DRIVING THOSE TWO APART,"
429,00:15:22.75,00:15:22.75,HE DRIVES THEM CLOSER TOGETHER.
430,00:15:24.25,00:15:24.25,"PHILLIP, STOP MAKING SO MUCH WORK FOR ME."
431,00:15:26.96,00:15:26.96,->> HOW ARE YOU DOING? ->> GOOD.
432,00:15:28.17,00:15:28.17,->> THAT WAS CRAZY. ->> I KNOW.
433,00:15:29.75,00:15:29.75,>> ARE YOU OKAY?
434,00:15:30.75,00:15:30.75,>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
435,00:15:32.29,00:15:32.29,I'M SCARED.
436,00:15:33.88,00:15:33.88,>> DON'T BE SCARED.
437,00:15:35.33,00:15:35.33,"ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, IS YOU JUST"
438,00:15:36.96,00:15:36.96,"HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY, OKAY?"
439,00:15:38.42,00:15:38.42,>> YEAH.
440,00:15:39.71,00:15:39.71,>> KEEP ASHLEY HAPPY.
441,00:15:40.79,00:15:40.79,IF YOU HEAR HER MENTION ANYTHING
442,00:15:42.08,00:15:42.08,ABOUT SOME KIND OF PLAN THAT
443,00:15:43.83,00:15:43.83,DOESN'T INVOLVE GETTING PHILLIP
444,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,OUT THEN WE NEED TO TALK.
445,00:15:47.00,00:15:47.00,>> I'M FOR SURE THAT SHE WANTS PHILLIP OUT.
446,00:15:48.42,00:15:48.42,>> SHE WANTS PHILLIP OUT. I KNOW.
447,00:15:50.33,00:15:50.33,>> SHE'S FREAKING OUT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO FOR HER.
448,00:15:52.12,00:15:52.12,">> YEAH, WELL, WE ARE GOING TO GO FOR HER, MAYBE."
449,00:15:54.92,00:15:54.92,-I DON'T KNOW. ->> REALLY?
450,00:15:56.08,00:15:56.08,>> BECAUSE GRANT IS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT ASHLEY'S
451,00:15:58.21,00:15:58.21,"ACTIONS, YOU KNOW."
452,00:15:59.42,00:15:59.42,AND GRANT WANTS TO GET ASHLEY OUT.
453,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,">> OKAY, WELL--"
454,00:16:02.17,00:16:02.17,>> IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I KNOW.
455,00:16:04.12,00:16:04.12,BUT JUST-- JUST TRUST ME THIS.
456,00:16:06.21,00:16:06.21,"LIKE, I KNOW AND ASHLEY HAVE"
457,00:16:07.92,00:16:07.92,BEEN FRIENDS THIS WHOLE GAME.
458,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,I PROMISE YOU I WILL GET YOU TO THE END.
459,00:16:12.08,00:16:12.08,I PROMISE YOU.
460,00:16:13.67,00:16:13.67,">> NATALIE AND I, YOU KNOW,"
461,00:16:16.21,00:16:16.21,WE'VE STUCK TOGETHER SINCE THE BEGINNING.
462,00:16:17.62,00:16:17.62,AND THE THING WITH NATALIE IS
463,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,SHE'S REALLY RELYING ON ROB A LOT.
464,00:16:20.79,00:16:20.79,"AND I RELY ON ROB, BUT I ALSO"
465,00:16:22.75,00:16:22.75,KNOW THAT HE'S PLAYING THE GAME.
466,00:16:25.54,00:16:25.54,AND I WOULD BET MY LIFE IF IT
467,00:16:27.71,00:16:27.71,"CAME DOWN TO GRANT, ME, NATALIE,"
468,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,"AND ROB IN THE FOUR, THAT ROB"
469,00:16:33.12,00:16:33.12,WOULD VOTE ONE OF US GIRLS OUT
470,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,IN A HEARTBEAT.
471,00:16:35.46,00:16:35.46,SO I THINK THE BEST PLAY FOR ME
472,00:16:37.38,00:16:37.38,IN THIS GAME IS TO JUST GET A
473,00:16:40.12,00:16:40.12,BIG MOVE GOING HERE AND GET RID
474,00:16:42.08,00:16:42.08,OF A STRONG COMPETITOR.
475,00:16:52.08,00:16:52.08,>> WE WERE JUST THINKING THAT IT
476,00:16:54.29,00:16:54.29,MIGHT BE SMARTER TO SEND GRANT
477,00:16:56.08,00:16:56.08,"TO REDEMPTION, AND THEN ONLY ONE"
478,00:16:57.62,00:16:57.62,"PERSON COMES BACK, WHEREAS IF"
479,00:16:59.38,00:16:59.38,"HE'S STILL HERE, AND MIKE COMES"
480,00:17:03.04,00:17:03.04,"BACK, THEN WE'VE GOT TO WORRY"
481,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,ABOUT GETTING RID OF MIKE AND HIM.
482,00:17:05.71,00:17:05.71,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
483,00:17:07.92,00:17:07.92,>> DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH PHILLIP?
484,00:17:11.88,00:17:11.88,>> NO. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP PHILLIP AROUND.
485,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,I JUST WANT TO DO WHAT'S THE
486,00:17:15.38,00:17:15.38,SMARTEST TO KEEP US THREE TOGETHER.
487,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,>> IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.
488,00:17:21.12,00:17:21.12,LET'S JUST SLEEP ON IT AND SEE
489,00:17:22.42,00:17:22.42,WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW.
490,00:17:24.46,00:17:24.46,ASHLEY ACTUALLY CAME TO ME WITH
491,00:17:26.21,00:17:26.21,THIS GENIUS PLAN.
492,00:17:27.42,00:17:27.42,LET'S GET RID OF GRANT NEXT.
493,00:17:29.58,00:17:29.58,I'VE ALREADY RUN THE NUMBERS ON
494,00:17:31.42,00:17:31.42,THIS SCENARIO WEEKS AGO.
495,00:17:32.25,00:17:32.25,IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
496,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,ALL IT DOES IS GIVE ASHLEY
497,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,ANOTHER WAY CLOSER TO SQUEEZING
498,00:17:37.62,00:17:37.62,HERSELF INTO THE FINALS.
499,00:17:43.21,00:17:43.21,"SHE'S NO GOOD, BRO."
500,00:17:44.42,00:17:44.42,SHE WANTS YOU GONE.
501,00:17:45.75,00:17:45.75,SHE WANTS TO THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS.
502,00:17:48.12,00:17:48.12,"SHE'S LIKE, YEAH, EVEN IF"
503,00:17:49.62,00:17:49.62,"PHILLIP WINS IMMUNITY, WHO CARES."
504,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,">> THAT'S A SNAKE, BRO."
505,00:17:52.12,00:17:52.12,">> DUDE, SHE IS."
506,00:17:53.33,00:17:53.33,"GRANT, I AIN'T DOING IT TO YOU."
507,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,>> I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.
508,00:17:56.12,00:17:56.12,>> I TOLD YOU YOU HAVE MY WORD.
509,00:17:58.08,00:17:58.08,BUT WE GOT TO WIN.
510,00:17:59.29,00:17:59.29,ME OR YOU HAS TO WIN.
511,00:18:01.21,00:18:01.21,">> DUDE, IT'S DONE."
512,00:18:02.67,00:18:02.67,>> WE HAVE TO WIN EVERY SINGLE ONE FROM HERE ON OUT.
513,00:18:04.29,00:18:04.29,ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL.
514,00:18:05.21,00:18:05.21,>> OW. MOTHER...
515,00:18:06.21,00:18:06.21,">> ASHLEY IS A DARK INDIVIDUAL,"
516,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,AND SHE'S RIDDEN ON A COATTAIL FAR ENOUGH.
517,00:18:11.83,00:18:11.83,"IF ASHLEY DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY,"
518,00:18:13.29,00:18:13.29,"SHE'S OUT OF THIS GAME, AND I'M"
519,00:18:14.42,00:18:14.42,"GOING TO BE HAPPY TO DO IT, HAPPY."
520,00:18:30.88,00:18:30.88,( LAUGHING )
521,00:18:41.67,00:18:41.67,>> ARE YOU READY?
522,00:18:42.54,00:18:42.54,">> I'M READY, BROTHER."
523,00:18:44.29,00:18:44.29,">> OKAY, GOOD."
524,00:18:45.12,00:18:45.12,>> WE'RE ALL ON BOARD HERE.
525,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,>> THE MORE THAN LIKELY SCENARIO
526,00:18:48.71,00:18:48.71,THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING IS
527,00:18:50.21,00:18:50.21,STILL FOR US IS STICKING TOGETHER UNTIL
528,00:18:51.92,00:18:51.92,"THE END, WHICH IF YOU TOLD ME"
529,00:18:53.92,00:18:53.92,THAT DAY 19 I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU A LIAR.
530,00:18:56.25,00:18:56.25,>> CHOPSTICKS.

532,00:18:59.62,00:18:59.62,>> DON'T EVEN GO THERE.
533,00:19:01.42,00:19:01.42,ASHLEY ACTUALLY CAME TO ME LAST
534,00:19:02.75,00:19:02.75,NIGHT AND SAID THAT SHE THINKS
535,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF GRANT
536,00:19:05.71,00:19:05.71,BEFORE PHILLIP.
537,00:19:06.58,00:19:06.58,ASHLEY'S HAD A FREE RIDE FOR 35
538,00:19:07.38,00:19:07.38,"DAYS, AND HER FAIRY TALE'S ABOUT"
539,00:19:09.46,00:19:09.46,TO COME TO AN END REAL ABRUPTLY.
540,00:19:12.79,00:19:12.79,>> RISE AND SHINE.

562,00:19:54.21,00:19:54.21,APPROACHED ROB WITH AN IDEA THAT
563,00:19:55.08,00:19:55.08,WE'RE GOING TO BLINDSIDE GRANT.
564,00:19:57.04,00:19:57.04,"AND I THOUGHT ROB WOULD BE LIKE,"

566,00:20:01.42,00:20:01.42,"WAS KIND OF HESITANT, AND THEN"
567,00:20:03.88,00:20:03.88,THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT HE
568,00:20:05.71,00:20:05.71,"WAS LIKE, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA."
569,00:20:07.62,00:20:07.62,"SO, WE'LL SEE, YOU KNOW."

599,00:21:10.46,00:21:10.46,"I'M, LIKE, SERIOUSLY GOING TO MAKE THAT WHEN I GO HOME."
600,00:21:13.12,00:21:13.12,>> I KNOW. >> BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE--
