294,00:16:20.96,00:16:20.96,How long are we going to behere?
295,00:16:22.58,00:16:22.58,"But also, like, a fight forsurvival."
296,00:16:28.25,00:16:28.25,"I think we should be reallycareful about, you know, what's"
297,00:16:31.12,00:16:31.12,"happening, and I trust you alot."
298,00:16:32.50,00:16:32.50,>> It's hard to trust anybody.That's why Gary told me I could
299,00:16:35.50,00:16:35.50,"trust you.He's like, ""Just, you know,"
300,00:16:37.12,00:16:37.12,"stick with Rafe."">> And that's same thing he told"
301,00:16:39.17,00:16:39.17,me.Judd's the only one that I feel
302,00:16:40.25,00:16:40.25,"is, like, ready to break.>> Yeah, he's..."
303,00:16:42.21,00:16:42.21,Yeah.>> You know?
304,00:16:44.04,00:16:44.04,>> He's a threat.He's definitely a threat.
305,00:16:46.04,00:16:46.04,The only person I really feellike I can trust now is Rafe.
306,00:16:49.08,00:16:49.08,I think he knows that I'mimportant to have around for
307,00:16:51.38,00:16:51.38,him because that alliance isgoing to start wanting to vote
308,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,"somebody out, and they have tosee Rafe as threat."
309,00:16:57.25,00:16:57.25,"Um, so he needs another buddy.I'm sure Judd or Cindy is going"
310,00:16:59.79,00:16:59.79,"to approach me, 'cause they'regoing to have to number-wise."
311,00:17:02.96,00:17:02.96,>> Right.>> If he talks to me or talks to
312,00:17:05.25,00:17:05.25,"Lydia, tries to vote againstyou, we'll just let you know."
313,00:17:09.38,00:17:09.38,">> Well, he's in control kindof, but also in a really tenuous"
314,00:17:12.42,00:17:12.42,position because you and me areway closer than him and me.
315,00:17:17.62,00:17:17.62,"And, like, we just need to catchJudd in some kind of lie."
316,00:17:22.08,00:17:22.08,>> Mm-hmm.>> So that we can show Steph
317,00:17:24.46,00:17:24.46,"that that's...'Cause right now, she really,"
318,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,really trusts him.I know that Judd is threatened
319,00:17:28.12,00:17:28.12,by me.I know that Judd might want to
320,00:17:29.83,00:17:29.83,"get me out before he says hedoes, so I have to make back-up"
321,00:17:32.67,00:17:32.67,"plans so that if he tries, thenI'll be safe."
322,00:17:36.62,00:17:36.62,"You can't trust a person likeJudd, but you can trust that you"
323,00:17:39.21,00:17:39.21,"can't trust him.>> So, so, Cindy, we-we should"
324,00:18:19.42,00:18:19.42,be all right for...still with
325,00:18:21.54,00:18:21.54,our final four.The reason I'm saying that is
326,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,because Danni does have thatclue.
327,00:18:25.96,00:18:25.96,"Okay, good, take that clue,fine, you know what I mean?"
328,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,Go ahead.>> She's not usually a front-
329,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"runner.>> No, she's not a threat at"
330,00:18:31.54,00:18:31.54,"all, so that's good for us.>> Mentally or physically, she's"
331,00:18:33.79,00:18:33.79,not usually a front-runner.One thing she's good at is
332,00:18:36.12,00:18:36.12,"shooting basketballs.>> That's it, so we have an edge"
333,00:18:38.62,00:18:38.62,on her.>> She must have something if
334,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,"she made it this far.>> If she wins, that's-that's"
335,00:18:42.25,00:18:42.25,"okay.I mean, it's not the end of our"
336,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,"world right here.If she wins it, that's fine."
337,00:18:48.08,00:18:48.08,"Then we get rid of Lydia.God, I'm so glad this worked out"
338,00:18:51.29,00:18:51.29,this way.>> They told me the mother lode.
339,00:19:13.38,00:19:13.38,"I just get my whole bunch, thenI'm good for the night."
340,00:19:18.08,00:19:18.08,That's all we do.We make two wood runs a day.
341,00:19:20.29,00:19:20.29,That's it.(mosquitoes buzzing)
342,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,>> (grunting)>> It's a lot more barren than I
343,00:19:25.42,00:19:25.42,"had expected, that's for sure.They have nothing, and it's so"
344,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,much work.Everything they do is just such
345,00:19:32.50,00:19:32.50,"a chore, really.>> This is a real deal, and most"
346,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17,"people would not survive outhere in a, you know, a day."
347,00:19:41.04,00:19:41.04,It's crazy.>> Hmm.
348,00:19:51.04,00:19:51.04,>> We're back.>> Hey.
349,00:19:52.54,00:19:52.54,">> Hi, guys.>> Hey!"

355,00:20:07.88,00:20:07.88,"Um, and so it's been kind ofnice."
356,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,"We got to meet them all, talk tothem, see that they're not"
357,00:20:12.92,00:20:12.92,"loving camp life at all.>> So, what'd you think about"
358,00:20:16.46,00:20:16.46,this experience?>> I've never camped ever before
359,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,in my life.I don't know how you do it.
360,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,>> It felt great having my wifehere at camp.
361,00:20:26.25,00:20:26.25,"I haven't been eating, so I feellike she actually made me full"
362,00:20:28.42,00:20:28.42,just by looking at her.It's like eating 25 White Castle
363,00:20:32.92,00:20:32.92,"cheeseburgers, man.(all saying good-byes)"
364,00:20:37.17,00:20:37.17,>> I'll see you soon.>> Nice meeting you.

373,00:21:09.12,00:21:09.12,"The longest I've never spoke tohim was, like, 24 hours."
374,00:21:11.71,00:21:11.71,"And, um...I just can't wait for"
375,00:21:14.67,00:21:14.67,him to come home.>> I just thought it was really
376,00:21:21.50,00:21:21.50,incredible that my sister got tobe here.
377,00:21:24.04,00:21:24.04,It's just going to make it evenmore of a memorable experience
378,00:21:27.21,00:21:27.21,forever.>> Bye.
379,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,">> Bye, you guys.>> Bye, you guys!"
380,00:21:40.54,00:21:40.54,">> It was bittersweet, but itwas more sweet than anything"
381,00:21:42.46,00:21:42.46,else.I hate good-byes.
382,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,"So I can't wait to say hello.>> Oh, thank you."
383,00:22:50.96,00:22:50.96,>> Judd was talking about howit's important to get rid of the
384,00:22:53.12,00:22:53.12,"strongest, um, you know,survivors that are left."
385,00:22:56.67,00:22:56.67,"And Rafe has the, uh...talked"
386,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,"to me the day before and said,you know, ""If Judd says anything"
387,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,"about voting me off, I think wecan get Stephenie's vote against"
388,00:23:04.25,00:23:04.25,"Judd.""And I know Lydia and I are"
389,00:23:05.62,00:23:05.62,"desperate.We'll, you know, stick with him."
390,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,">> Judd, you know what?Maybe it's time we make a deal."
391,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,>> You know what?I don't have a problem with
392,00:23:13.62,00:23:13.62,that.>> It's funny.
393,00:23:15.12,00:23:15.12,"The longer you stick around, themore problems you can cause."
394,00:23:17.33,00:23:17.33,"You know, more doors will open,so it seems like I have a little"
395,00:23:20.21,00:23:20.21,bit of a crack.(laughs)
396,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys.First things first."
397,00:23:41.25,00:23:41.25,"Rafe, give up immunity.You've had this for awhile."
398,00:23:48.75,00:23:48.75,"Once again, immunity is back upfor grabs."
399,00:23:52.25,00:23:52.25,"All right, let's get to today'schallenge."
400,00:23:54.46,00:23:54.46,It is for immunity.It requires smarts.
401,00:23:58.25,00:23:58.25,It's a bit of a human chessgame.
402,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,"Here is how it works.One at a time, you're each going"
403,00:24:02.12,00:24:02.12,to make a move on our multi-level board by flipping a tile
404,00:24:05.29,00:24:05.29,to its red side and stepping onit.
405,00:24:08.54,00:24:08.54,You can move forward.You can move backward.
406,00:24:12.62,00:24:12.62,You can move side to side.You cannot move diagonally.
407,00:24:16.25,00:24:16.25,"Once you stepped off the redtile, no one can step onto it"
408,00:24:19.50,00:24:19.50,"again.In addition, the top platform is"
409,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,"a spinning platform, so if atany time, you want to"
410,00:24:26.21,00:24:26.21,"strategically relocate yourselfto somewhere else on the board,"
411,00:24:29.58,00:24:29.58,spin yourself to a new spot.As you all move around the
412,00:24:32.71,00:24:32.71,"board, there will be fewer andfewer white tiles to flip over."
413,00:24:36.83,00:24:36.83,"At some point, you'll run out oftiles to step onto."
414,00:24:39.88,00:24:39.88,"When that happens, you're out ofthe game."
415,00:24:42.17,00:24:42.17,"Last person left standing winsimmunity, guarantees themselves"
416,00:24:46.21,00:24:46.21,"a spot in the final five.Danni, at the auction, you"
417,00:24:51.54,00:24:51.54,purchased an advantage...>> Yep.
418,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83,>> JEFF: ...to today's immunity
419,00:24:54.83,00:24:54.83,challenge.You still have the envelope?
420,00:24:56.83,00:24:56.83,">> Yes.>> JEFF: Okay, let me see it."
421,00:24:58.21,00:24:58.21,"Still sealed.>> Oh, yeah."
422,00:24:59.88,00:24:59.88,">> JEFF: Good, don't open ityet."
423,00:25:01.17,00:25:01.17,>> I'm a good girl.>> JEFF: Take a spot on the
424,00:25:02.54,00:25:02.54,"board, and we'll get started.All right, we've drawn for spots"
425,00:25:06.38,00:25:06.38,"on the board.Danni, time to open your"
426,00:25:10.21,00:25:10.21,immunity advantage.>> See what it is.
427,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,>> JEFF: Read it out loud.>> Switch positions with
428,00:25:17.96,00:25:17.96,"any player.>> JEFF: So, what that means is,"
429,00:25:20.75,00:25:20.75,at any time in this game you cantrade spots with any player one
430,00:25:26.46,00:25:26.46,time.If you understand how to play
431,00:25:28.75,00:25:28.75,"this game, that is a hugeadvantage."
432,00:25:30.71,00:25:30.71,"If you don't, it might justextend your life a little"
433,00:25:33.58,00:25:33.58,longer.>> Let's find out.
434,00:25:35.67,00:25:35.67,Everybody make your firstmove.
435,00:25:45.62,00:25:45.62,"Everybody's on the board.Danni, you're up."
436,00:25:54.38,00:25:54.38,Cindy.Danni goes sideways.

449,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,No more tiles to flip over.Cindy can't move.
450,00:27:04.75,00:27:04.75,She's first one out of the game.Take a spot on the bench.
451,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,Steph is up.Steph's carved out a nice

453,00:27:19.54,00:27:19.54,>> Can I switch?>> JEFF: You can switch any time

501,00:31:45.12,00:31:45.12,I believe Judd for the most partbut already made clear that he's
502,00:31:48.50,00:31:48.50,playing this game and doanything to win.
503,00:31:50.38,00:31:50.38,He's already been caught inquite a few lies.
504,00:31:53.08,00:31:53.08,And Danni really hasn't lied atall.
505,00:32:00.29,00:32:00.29,>> Whoa.>> Said a million times he's
506,00:32:49.75,00:32:49.75,"like, ""I'm here to win.I'll do whatever it takes."""
507,00:32:52.29,00:32:52.29,>> We have to be...>> We've been trying to be
508,00:32:55.00,00:32:55.00,honest.>> For the most part.
509,00:32:56.50,00:32:56.50,>> Like I don't know...>> We were saying if he goes
510,00:32:59.38,00:32:59.38,tonight we'll want Lydia to gonext then we'll go to the four.
511,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,>> Yeah.>> With Cindy.

515,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,us.>> She said she would vote for
516,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,Judd.>> I think she would.
517,00:33:16.88,00:33:16.88,">> You do?And what, do we tell Cindy?"
518,00:33:19.04,00:33:19.04,>> What do you think?>> My heart tells me get rid of
519,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,Lydia because Judd and I havebeen really close.
520,00:33:24.17,00:33:24.17,">> At the same time, if someoneis going to slit your throat"
521,00:33:27.62,00:33:27.62,"because they like your company,hell, no, they got to go."
522,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,">> I love Judd, though.I do."
523,00:33:33.71,00:33:33.71,I told his wife that we weresticking together.
524,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,"I feel horrible.But if he's likely to turn, I"

527,00:33:44.04,00:33:44.04,And now she's kinda thinkingmaybe we might vote Judd out
528,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,tonight.So hopefully my plan worked to
529,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,rat Judd out.>> Absolutely.
530,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,>> It's weird how the originalplan was to take Danni out.
531,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"She won immunity on the day thatshe needed it, you know what I'm"
532,00:34:04.62,00:34:04.62,saying?I'm here if you want to use my
533,00:34:08.58,00:34:08.58,vote.If not.

541,00:34:59.71,00:34:59.71,">> We have alliance to me,Cindy, Stephenie and Rafe."
542,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,And we had agreed if Danni wonimmunity it's going to be Lydia.
543,00:35:09.79,00:35:09.79,">> Do you know if she's lied?>> She's working, man."
544,00:35:13.29,00:35:13.29,"I said it could be me, it couldbe you."
545,00:35:16.71,00:35:16.71,>> It could be Rafe.>> That's what I said.
546,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,I said it could be anybody here.>> That's funny.
547,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,">> No, it's not.But you got to say something."
548,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,"I mean, you can't just sitthere."
549,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,You know what I mean?Jellybean?
550,00:35:32.12,00:35:32.12,">> I know what you mean,jellybean."
551,00:35:39.92,00:35:39.92,">> Yeah, I'll miss Lydia aroundcamp."
552,00:35:42.46,00:35:42.46,"I'll miss her singing anddancing, all that."
553,00:35:45.25,00:35:45.25,But one other person goes I moveup.
554,00:35:48.21,00:35:48.21,"No hard feelings.So, you know, pretty glad"
555,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,"somebody's going home right now.As long as it ain't me, man,"
556,00:35:54.75,00:35:54.75,I'll always have a smile on myface.
