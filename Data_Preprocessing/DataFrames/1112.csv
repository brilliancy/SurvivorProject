1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously
2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,on Survivor: Gary tried to lure Lydia away from the Alliance of
3,00:00:05.67,00:00:05.67,Five. >> But Judd was listening in.
4,00:00:11.04,00:00:11.04,">> I hear Gary working all over Lydia, man."
5,00:00:14.29,00:00:14.29,Her eyes are bulging out of her head.
6,00:00:16.38,00:00:16.38,"""Yeah, Gary."" >> I have to cover my own ass,"
7,00:00:22.83,00:00:22.83,"so if somebody approach me with a better deal, I'm going with"
8,00:00:25.17,00:00:25.17,it. >> JEFF: At the reward
9,00:00:27.38,00:00:27.38,"challenge, the shift in loyalty was exposed when Lydia helped"
10,00:00:30.08,00:00:30.08,remove Stephenie from the game. Steph not happy at all with
11,00:00:33.33,00:00:33.33,"that, Lydia. >> I haven't eaten."
12,00:00:35.12,00:00:35.12,Steph ate three times. >> So did Gary.
13,00:00:37.62,00:00:37.62,So did Danni. >> JEFF: And Cindy smashed her
14,00:00:40.04,00:00:40.04,way to victory. >> Cindy!
15,00:00:42.54,00:00:42.54,>> JEFF: Cindy chose Rafe to join her on the hot springs
16,00:00:45.62,00:00:45.62,"waterfall reward. >> You know, Cindy and I are"
17,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83,kind of in this together for better or for worse.
18,00:00:50.29,00:00:50.29,"This was, like, the best day. >> JEFF: Back at camp, with"
19,00:00:54.29,00:00:54.29,"Lydia on board, Gary and Danni concocted a plan to approach"
20,00:00:57.50,00:00:57.50,Rafe to join them in an alliance.
21,00:01:04.04,00:01:04.04,>> JEFF: But Danni was strategically keeping her
22,00:01:06.21,00:01:06.21,options open. >> I've got to look at who is in
23,00:01:08.12,00:01:08.12,control of the game and play up to it 'cause I'm not going to
24,00:01:11.88,00:01:11.88,go home. >> JEFF: At the immunity
25,00:01:14.38,00:01:14.38,"challenge, Gary and Rafe were neck and neck, but it was Rafe"
26,00:01:16.71,00:01:16.71,"who won immunity. Once again, Rafe wins immunity!"
27,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,"Before Tribal Council, Gary had the opportunity to make his move"
28,00:01:25.83,00:01:25.83,with Rafe. >> Rafe told me that he didn't
29,00:01:36.75,00:01:36.75,"trust Judd, so at some point, they're going to turn on each"
30,00:01:39.58,00:01:39.58,"other. >> At Tribal Council, Gary"
31,00:01:43.88,00:01:43.88,exposed Judd's lie about the hidden idol.
32,00:01:47.08,00:01:47.08,">> He goes, ""Okay, I'll tell you."
33,00:01:48.12,00:01:48.12,"It's on the ground."" Well, I followed them out in"
34,00:01:49.88,00:01:49.88,"the woods the next day, and the idol was in the tree."
35,00:01:53.00,00:01:53.00,>> JEFF: You got caught. You got outed tonight for lying.
36,00:01:55.88,00:01:55.88,">> Okay, all right. I lied about the damn idol."
37,00:01:57.88,00:01:57.88,">> JEFF: But despite Gary's efforts, his tribe considered"
38,00:02:00.21,00:02:00.21,"him too much of a threat. Rafe stuck with his alliance,"
39,00:02:04.00,00:02:04.00,and even Danni and Lydia helped vote Gary out.
40,00:02:07.75,00:02:07.75,Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:17.46,00:02:17.46,(theme song playing) \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
42,00:03:35.12,00:03:35.12,">> Well, last night at Tribal Council, Gary got voted out,"
43,00:03:37.75,00:03:37.75,"and, uh, now that there's six of us left, I'm next on the totem"
44,00:03:41.25,00:03:41.25,"pole, you know? About ready to have my head"
45,00:03:43.92,00:03:43.92,chopped off. >> I was awake.
46,00:03:47.62,00:03:47.62,"I was not delirious or anything, dreaming."
47,00:03:50.62,00:03:50.62,I smelled sausage and eggs. I really did.
48,00:03:54.00,00:03:54.00,">> Well, if you smelled bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs,"
49,00:03:56.08,00:03:56.08,"Lyd, it's probably, uh, Steph farting again."
50,00:03:58.08,00:03:58.08,So that could be a little bit of a problem.
51,00:04:00.12,00:04:00.12,">> No, I went to the bathroom. No more gas."
52,00:04:03.17,00:04:03.17,">> You know, usually when you got, like, that egg smell..."
53,00:04:05.50,00:04:05.50,>> Egg smell. >> First thing in the
54,00:04:08.25,00:04:08.25,"morning, they're not eggs, man. >> It's funny how everybody"
55,00:04:12.88,00:04:12.88,tries to play it off like nothing happened when we just
56,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,"had this heated Tribal Council last night, you know, how"
57,00:04:19.38,00:04:19.38,there's been a lot of lying. And I think it's 'cause they're
58,00:04:22.29,00:04:22.29,"all scared. I mean, after everything's been"
59,00:04:24.17,00:04:24.17,"called out into the open, I just kind of sit back last night, and"
60,00:04:26.46,00:04:26.46,"I'm like, ""These people are unbelievable."""
61,00:04:29.96,00:04:29.96,I have a feeling who's going to win this one.
62,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,">> Style. >> That's your style, right?"
63,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,You're up. >> Is it my turn?
64,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33,>> Oh! >> Wow!
65,00:04:44.54,00:04:44.54,>> Whoo! >> Spunky.
66,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,">> That was pretty, man. >> I think Judd's was better."
67,00:04:48.58,00:04:48.58,>> I'm definitely not going to go down without a fight.
68,00:04:50.71,00:04:50.71,">> I mean, I'm going to work something out."
69,00:04:52.54,00:04:52.54,"I mean, I know Lydia-- she feels like she's on the outs now with"
70,00:04:55.96,00:04:55.96,"this group, and so I know she's definitely in with me."
71,00:04:58.71,00:04:58.71,"And I think it would take one more person, um, maybe, to-to"
72,00:05:02.04,00:05:02.04,"throw something. Ooh, my shoe."
73,00:05:05.21,00:05:05.21,(grunts) This perfect little alliance is
74,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,going to have to start breaking up.
75,00:05:09.38,00:05:09.38,It's going to have to start attacking each other.
76,00:05:11.75,00:05:11.75,"I mean, they-they can't all go to the final spot."
77,00:05:13.96,00:05:13.96,"I mean, it's just not going to happen."
78,00:05:16.04,00:05:16.04,>> Ooh! >> I thought were going to do a
79,00:05:17.54,00:05:17.54,back flip. >> Wow.
80,00:05:18.88,00:05:18.88,">> That was beautiful, Danni. >> Thank you, thank you."
81,00:05:20.62,00:05:20.62,"I'm seeing stars. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys."
82,00:05:32.75,00:05:32.75,Go ahead and take a spot on the bench.
83,00:05:35.50,00:05:35.50,>> (laughs) >> JEFF: Welcome to the Survivor
84,00:05:39.75,00:05:39.75,auction. You each have $500 US.
85,00:05:43.29,00:05:43.29,"Sharing of money is allowed, but only the two people who pool"
86,00:05:46.92,00:05:46.92,their money can share in the item.
87,00:05:49.04,00:05:49.04,The auction will end without warning.
88,00:05:52.08,00:05:52.08,Everyone here is not guaranteed an item.
89,00:05:53.79,00:05:53.79,"If you see something you like, you should bid on it."
90,00:05:56.92,00:05:56.92,Make sense? >> Yes.
91,00:05:58.46,00:05:58.46,>> JEFF: Get to the first item. A plate of beef jerky.
92,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67,>> Oh. >> JEFF: A little protein.

94,00:06:06.00,00:06:06.00,"for 20. Steph, not even interested."
95,00:06:08.25,00:06:08.25,Nobody else wants this? Going once.
96,00:06:11.38,00:06:11.38,Going twice. Sold to Danni for 20 bucks.
97,00:06:15.50,00:06:15.50,"Pretty good bargain at 20 bucks, right?"
98,00:06:17.83,00:06:17.83,>> Right. >> JEFF: Let me tempt you with
99,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,"this. >> Oh, no."
100,00:06:22.21,00:06:22.21,>> JEFF: You can keep your beef jerky for 20 bucks or you can
101,00:06:24.79,00:06:24.79,trade it for what's covered. >> I'm going with the beef
102,00:06:28.25,00:06:28.25,jerky. >> JEFF: Come on up.
103,00:06:30.79,00:06:30.79,>> 20 bucks. >> JEFF: You know what you have.
104,00:06:34.08,00:06:34.08,Let's see what you didn't take. Uncooked corn.
105,00:06:38.08,00:06:38.08,>> Whoo! >> (laughing): Oh!
106,00:06:40.12,00:06:40.12,>> JEFF: Something nobody wants. Ready for the next item?
107,00:06:47.33,00:06:47.33,"Three chocolate chip cookies. >> Oh, my God!"

132,00:07:42.25,00:07:42.25,"it. Boy, you do have a lot of bites"
133,00:07:43.38,00:07:43.38,on that back. Wow!

204,00:11:12.71,00:11:12.71,a favor. >> Will you give me 200?
205,00:11:16.25,00:11:16.25,">> JEFF: Cindy, you're giving him everything you have?"
206,00:11:18.21,00:11:18.21,>> I was already out. I already didn't have enough.
207,00:11:20.42,00:11:20.42,>> JEFF: Steph takes all of Lydia's money.
208,00:11:22.58,00:11:22.58,She's counting it up. Judd has taken all of Cindy's
209,00:11:24.50,00:11:24.50,"money. >> 40, 60, 80..."
210,00:11:27.50,00:11:27.50,>> JEFF: Who's getting a visit with their loved one?
211,00:11:29.46,00:11:29.46,">> 20, 40, 50... There is 750."

215,00:11:45.00,00:11:45.00,Steph has done everything she can.
216,00:11:49.50,00:11:49.50,>> Judd has bought his loved one for 880 bucks.
217,00:11:53.17,00:11:53.17,">> Kristin, go give him some love."

221,00:12:11.75,00:12:11.75,invite two other loved ones to camp with you as well.
222,00:12:15.92,00:12:15.92,">> Judd, please... >> Oh, yes!"

226,00:12:28.54,00:12:28.54,"They will not get anything, not so much as a hug."
227,00:12:31.75,00:12:31.75,So you're going to make two people really happy and three
228,00:12:35.08,00:12:35.08,"people really unhappy. >> I mean, Cindy, of course."
229,00:12:42.04,00:12:42.04,"If it wasn't for her, my wife wouldn't be here."
230,00:12:44.00,00:12:44.00,">> JEFF: Mindy, you are going to get the Survivor experience."
231,00:12:47.12,00:12:47.12,(applause) >> She's still strong.

234,00:12:58.17,00:12:58.17,to see her boyfriend. Lydia hasn't seen her brother in
235,00:13:01.33,00:13:01.33,two years. >> I'm going to take my Jersey
236,00:13:04.17,00:13:04.17,"girl with me. >> JEFF: Michael, give her a"

239,00:13:16.21,00:13:16.21,back over to the bench. >> This is Judd.
240,00:13:18.71,00:13:18.71,(laughing) >> JEFF: Got three very happy

242,00:13:24.04,00:13:24.04,"night alone. Say your good-byes, guys."
243,00:13:26.79,00:13:26.79,">> Take care. Keep up the good work, all"
244,00:13:28.46,00:13:28.46,"right? >> Bye, Joe."
245,00:13:30.08,00:13:30.08,>> Bye. Be tough.

248,00:13:39.25,00:13:39.25,"Danni, Rafe, head on out. >> Bye, guys."
249,00:13:45.75,00:13:45.75,">> JEFF: All right, guys. Take them back to camp."
250,00:14:07.62,00:14:07.62,">> Welcome home, folks. Michael, Kristy and Mindy, this"
251,00:14:10.46,00:14:10.46,"is what we call home for 31 days, man."
252,00:14:14.08,00:14:14.08,"And that's how we get our water, our wood and everything."
253,00:14:17.46,00:14:17.46,This is why Uncle Chub lost 40 pounds.
254,00:14:20.54,00:14:20.54,This is where we live for 31 days.
255,00:14:22.33,00:14:22.33,"This is what we call home, man. This is what we've been living"
256,00:14:25.29,00:14:25.29,"in, so welcome to beautiful Guatemala."
257,00:14:28.92,00:14:28.92,>> Thank you. >> Nice to meet you.
258,00:14:31.08,00:14:31.08,">> Finally. >> Judd, you learned how to make"
259,00:14:32.67,00:14:32.67,"fire? >> I'm, like, the Iron Man."
260,00:14:34.33,00:14:34.33,>> Get out! No way!
261,00:14:36.33,00:14:36.33,">> My wife was pretty shocked, man, at my camping skills."
262,00:14:39.08,00:14:39.08,She was digging it. She thought it was pretty hot.
263,00:14:42.67,00:14:42.67,"She thought I was a sexy camper. This is how we get our water,"
264,00:14:45.62,00:14:45.62,'cause you're always dehydrated here.
265,00:14:47.21,00:14:47.21,This is lake water that we got to boil.
266,00:14:49.50,00:14:49.50,Just drink it right out. >> Really?
267,00:14:54.96,00:14:54.96,Can I have a little? He knows what he's doing.
268,00:14:57.08,00:14:57.08,I never thought he'd know what to do.
269,00:14:59.04,00:14:59.04,"I'm shocked, 'cause he seems like he's doing it all."
270,00:15:01.17,00:15:01.17,I'm very proud of him. I'm impressed.
271,00:15:04.92,00:15:04.92,">> Usually, we take our palm fronds and we spread them out"
272,00:15:06.83,00:15:06.83,all over here. People who sleep by the fire.
273,00:15:09.46,00:15:09.46,"And I sleep right here. >> I'm excited to be here,"
274,00:15:12.92,00:15:12.92,because this is what I grew up doing.
275,00:15:15.29,00:15:15.29,Playing wilderness people was our favorite thing to play.
276,00:15:17.92,00:15:17.92,"It's, like, our greatest adventure yet."
277,00:15:20.46,00:15:20.46,>> The first two days was an 11.
278,00:15:21.50,00:15:21.50,5-mile hike. We had to stop and just sleep in
279,00:15:23.29,00:15:23.29,the jungle somewhere. Through thick jungle.
280,00:15:27.04,00:15:27.04,It was horrible. We thought we were going to die.
281,00:15:28.79,00:15:28.79,"Oh, my God. To have Mike here-- it's a dream"
282,00:15:31.46,00:15:31.46,"come true. I owe Judd big time, 'cause this"
283,00:15:34.96,00:15:34.96,is the second time he's given me a sweet reward and shared a
284,00:15:38.25,00:15:38.25,sweet reward with me. >> This is all coming down to
285,00:15:41.42,00:15:41.42,"the wire here, but we-we've got got a tight alliance here."
286,00:15:44.33,00:15:44.33,"It's me, Steph, Cindy and Rafe in an alliance right now that's"
287,00:15:48.50,00:15:48.50,"tight as can be. Steph, I hope, goes my way."
288,00:15:52.33,00:15:52.33,"That takes me to the final two, if all goes well."
289,00:16:05.88,00:16:05.88,">> It's been awhile since we've been here, Rafe."
290,00:16:08.04,00:16:08.04,">> No kidding. >> Wow, this is our..."
291,00:16:10.12,00:16:10.12,">> It's been, like, 20 days... >> Day one camp."
292,00:16:13.04,00:16:13.04,>> We came back to the old Yaxha camp today after the reward
293,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,"challenge, and it was like a homecoming of sorts, getting to"
294,00:16:18.88,00:16:18.88,the camp and seeing that old lean-to.
295,00:16:20.96,00:16:20.96,How long are we going to be here?
296,00:16:22.58,00:16:22.58,"But also, like, a fight for survival."
297,00:16:28.25,00:16:28.25,"I think we should be really careful about, you know, what's"
298,00:16:31.12,00:16:31.12,"happening, and I trust you a lot."
299,00:16:32.50,00:16:32.50,>> It's hard to trust anybody. That's why Gary told me I could
300,00:16:35.50,00:16:35.50,"trust you. He's like, ""Just, you know,"
301,00:16:37.12,00:16:37.12,"stick with Rafe."" >> And that's same thing he told"
302,00:16:39.17,00:16:39.17,me. Judd's the only one that I feel
303,00:16:40.25,00:16:40.25,"is, like, ready to break. >> Yeah, he's..."
304,00:16:42.21,00:16:42.21,Yeah. >> You know?
305,00:16:44.04,00:16:44.04,>> He's a threat. He's definitely a threat.
306,00:16:46.04,00:16:46.04,The only person I really feel like I can trust now is Rafe.
307,00:16:49.08,00:16:49.08,I think he knows that I'm important to have around for
308,00:16:51.38,00:16:51.38,him because that alliance is going to start wanting to vote
309,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,"somebody out, and they have to see Rafe as threat."
310,00:16:57.25,00:16:57.25,"Um, so he needs another buddy. I'm sure Judd or Cindy is going"
311,00:16:59.79,00:16:59.79,"to approach me, 'cause they're going to have to number-wise."
312,00:17:02.96,00:17:02.96,>> Right. >> If he talks to me or talks to
313,00:17:05.25,00:17:05.25,"Lydia, tries to vote against you, we'll just let you know."
314,00:17:09.38,00:17:09.38,">> Well, he's in control kind of, but also in a really tenuous"
315,00:17:12.42,00:17:12.42,position because you and me are way closer than him and me.
316,00:17:17.62,00:17:17.62,"And, like, we just need to catch Judd in some kind of lie."
317,00:17:22.08,00:17:22.08,>> Mm-hmm. >> So that we can show Steph
318,00:17:24.46,00:17:24.46,"that that's... 'Cause right now, she really,"
319,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,really trusts him. I know that Judd is threatened
320,00:17:28.12,00:17:28.12,by me. I know that Judd might want to
321,00:17:29.83,00:17:29.83,"get me out before he says he does, so I have to make back-up"
322,00:17:32.67,00:17:32.67,"plans so that if he tries, then I'll be safe."
323,00:17:36.62,00:17:36.62,"You can't trust a person like Judd, but you can trust that you"
324,00:17:39.21,00:17:39.21,"can't trust him. >> So, so, Cindy, we-we should"
325,00:18:19.42,00:18:19.42,be all right for... still with
326,00:18:21.54,00:18:21.54,our final four. The reason I'm saying that is
327,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,because Danni does have that clue.
328,00:18:25.96,00:18:25.96,"Okay, good, take that clue, fine, you know what I mean?"
329,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,Go ahead. >> She's not usually a front-
330,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,"runner. >> No, she's not a threat at"
331,00:18:31.54,00:18:31.54,"all, so that's good for us. >> Mentally or physically, she's"
332,00:18:33.79,00:18:33.79,not usually a front-runner. One thing she's good at is
333,00:18:36.12,00:18:36.12,"shooting basketballs. >> That's it, so we have an edge"
334,00:18:38.62,00:18:38.62,on her. >> She must have something if
335,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,"she made it this far. >> If she wins, that's-that's"
336,00:18:42.25,00:18:42.25,"okay. I mean, it's not the end of our"
337,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,"world right here. If she wins it, that's fine."
338,00:18:48.08,00:18:48.08,"Then we get rid of Lydia. God, I'm so glad this worked out"
339,00:18:51.29,00:18:51.29,this way. >> They told me the mother lode.
340,00:19:13.38,00:19:13.38,"I just get my whole bunch, then I'm good for the night."
341,00:19:18.08,00:19:18.08,That's all we do. We make two wood runs a day.
342,00:19:20.29,00:19:20.29,That's it. (mosquitoes buzzing)
343,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,>> (grunting) >> It's a lot more barren than I
344,00:19:25.42,00:19:25.42,"had expected, that's for sure. They have nothing, and it's so"
345,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,much work. Everything they do is just such
346,00:19:32.50,00:19:32.50,"a chore, really. >> This is a real deal, and most"
347,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17,"people would not survive out here in a, you know, a day."
348,00:19:41.04,00:19:41.04,It's crazy. >> Hmm.
349,00:19:51.04,00:19:51.04,>> We're back. >> Hey.
350,00:19:52.54,00:19:52.54,">> Hi, guys. >> Hey!"
351,00:19:54.25,00:19:54.25,">> Hey, you! Still there."
352,00:19:57.33,00:19:57.33,>> Hi. >> We just started making corn.
353,00:20:00.92,00:20:00.92,">> What do you say there, Mr. Rafe-inator?"
354,00:20:02.88,00:20:02.88,">> We just came back and walked in, and we didn't think that the"
355,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,"family members would still be here, but they are."
356,00:20:07.88,00:20:07.88,"Um, and so it's been kind of nice."
357,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,"We got to meet them all, talk to them, see that they're not"
358,00:20:12.92,00:20:12.92,"loving camp life at all. >> So, what'd you think about"
359,00:20:16.46,00:20:16.46,this experience? >> I've never camped ever before
360,00:20:19.54,00:20:19.54,in my life. I don't know how you do it.
361,00:20:24.08,00:20:24.08,>> It felt great having my wife here at camp.
362,00:20:26.25,00:20:26.25,"I haven't been eating, so I feel like she actually made me full"
363,00:20:28.42,00:20:28.42,just by looking at her. It's like eating 25 White Castle
364,00:20:32.92,00:20:32.92,"cheeseburgers, man. (all saying good-byes)"
365,00:20:37.17,00:20:37.17,>> I'll see you soon. >> Nice meeting you.
366,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,Good luck. Bye.
367,00:20:40.29,00:20:40.29,>> Nice meeting you. >> We all walked down here to
368,00:20:52.21,00:20:52.21,the boat dock and had to say good-bye to our loved ones.
369,00:20:55.04,00:20:55.04,"And it was hard, but I'm glad she was here to see it."
370,00:20:58.38,00:20:58.38,"She wished me lots of luck and she knows I can do it, man."
371,00:21:02.12,00:21:02.12,I'm going to do it. >> You've made it through the
372,00:21:04.21,00:21:04.21,hard part. >> I know.
373,00:21:05.62,00:21:05.62,>> I love you so much. I've missed Judd so much.
374,00:21:09.12,00:21:09.12,"The longest I've never spoke to him was, like, 24 hours."
375,00:21:11.71,00:21:11.71,"And, um... I just can't wait for"
376,00:21:14.67,00:21:14.67,him to come home. >> I just thought it was really
377,00:21:21.50,00:21:21.50,incredible that my sister got to be here.
378,00:21:24.04,00:21:24.04,It's just going to make it even more of a memorable experience
379,00:21:27.21,00:21:27.21,forever. >> Bye.
380,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,">> Bye, you guys. >> Bye, you guys!"
381,00:21:40.54,00:21:40.54,">> It was bittersweet, but it was more sweet than anything"
382,00:21:42.46,00:21:42.46,else. I hate good-byes.
383,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,"So I can't wait to say hello. >> Oh, thank you."
384,00:22:50.96,00:22:50.96,>> Judd was talking about how it's important to get rid of the
385,00:22:53.12,00:22:53.12,"strongest, um, you know, survivors that are left."
386,00:22:56.67,00:22:56.67,"And Rafe has the, uh... talked"
387,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,"to me the day before and said, you know, ""If Judd says anything"
388,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,"about voting me off, I think we can get Stephenie's vote against"
389,00:23:04.25,00:23:04.25,"Judd."" And I know Lydia and I are"
390,00:23:05.62,00:23:05.62,"desperate. We'll, you know, stick with him."
391,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,">> Judd, you know what? Maybe it's time we make a deal."
392,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,>> You know what? I don't have a problem with
393,00:23:13.62,00:23:13.62,that. >> It's funny.
394,00:23:15.12,00:23:15.12,"The longer you stick around, the more problems you can cause."
395,00:23:17.33,00:23:17.33,"You know, more doors will open, so it seems like I have a little"
396,00:23:20.21,00:23:20.21,bit of a crack. (laughs)
397,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys. First things first."
398,00:23:41.25,00:23:41.25,"Rafe, give up immunity. You've had this for awhile."
399,00:23:48.75,00:23:48.75,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
400,00:23:52.25,00:23:52.25,"All right, let's get to today's challenge."
401,00:23:54.46,00:23:54.46,It is for immunity. It requires smarts.
402,00:23:58.25,00:23:58.25,It's a bit of a human chess game.
403,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,"Here is how it works. One at a time, you're each going"
404,00:24:02.12,00:24:02.12,to make a move on our multi- level board by flipping a tile
405,00:24:05.29,00:24:05.29,to its red side and stepping on it.
406,00:24:08.54,00:24:08.54,You can move forward. You can move backward.
407,00:24:12.62,00:24:12.62,You can move side to side. You cannot move diagonally.
408,00:24:16.25,00:24:16.25,"Once you stepped off the red tile, no one can step onto it"
409,00:24:19.50,00:24:19.50,"again. In addition, the top platform is"
410,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,"a spinning platform, so if at any time, you want to"
411,00:24:26.21,00:24:26.21,"strategically relocate yourself to somewhere else on the board,"
412,00:24:29.58,00:24:29.58,spin yourself to a new spot. As you all move around the
413,00:24:32.71,00:24:32.71,"board, there will be fewer and fewer white tiles to flip over."
414,00:24:36.83,00:24:36.83,"At some point, you'll run out of tiles to step onto."
415,00:24:39.88,00:24:39.88,"When that happens, you're out of the game."
416,00:24:42.17,00:24:42.17,"Last person left standing wins immunity, guarantees themselves"
417,00:24:46.21,00:24:46.21,"a spot in the final five. Danni, at the auction, you"
418,00:24:51.54,00:24:51.54,purchased an advantage... >> Yep.
419,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83,>> JEFF: ... to today's immunity
420,00:24:54.83,00:24:54.83,challenge. You still have the envelope?
421,00:24:56.83,00:24:56.83,">> Yes. >> JEFF: Okay, let me see it."
422,00:24:58.21,00:24:58.21,"Still sealed. >> Oh, yeah."
423,00:24:59.88,00:24:59.88,">> JEFF: Good, don't open it yet."
424,00:25:01.17,00:25:01.17,>> I'm a good girl. >> JEFF: Take a spot on the
425,00:25:02.54,00:25:02.54,"board, and we'll get started. All right, we've drawn for spots"
426,00:25:06.38,00:25:06.38,"on the board. Danni, time to open your"
427,00:25:10.21,00:25:10.21,immunity advantage. >> See what it is.
428,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,>> JEFF: Read it out loud. >> Switch positions with
429,00:25:17.96,00:25:17.96,"any player. >> JEFF: So, what that means is,"
430,00:25:20.75,00:25:20.75,at any time in this game you can trade spots with any player one
431,00:25:26.46,00:25:26.46,time. If you understand how to play
432,00:25:28.75,00:25:28.75,"this game, that is a huge advantage."
433,00:25:30.71,00:25:30.71,"If you don't, it might just extend your life a little"
434,00:25:33.58,00:25:33.58,longer. >> Let's find out.
435,00:25:35.67,00:25:35.67,Everybody make your first move.
436,00:25:45.62,00:25:45.62,"Everybody's on the board. Danni, you're up."
437,00:25:54.38,00:25:54.38,Cindy. Danni goes sideways.
438,00:25:56.75,00:25:56.75,Cindy goes forward. Judd.
439,00:26:02.96,00:26:02.96,Rafe. Steph.
440,00:26:11.75,00:26:11.75,Lydia. Danni.
441,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,Cindy. Cindy continues to move
442,00:26:25.12,00:26:25.12,forward. Judd.
443,00:26:28.00,00:26:28.00,Rafe. Stephenie.
444,00:26:32.04,00:26:32.04,Anxious to go. Lydia.
445,00:26:37.17,00:26:37.17,Everybody with a slightly different game plan.
446,00:26:42.83,00:26:42.83,"Cindy, going up to the spinning platform."
447,00:26:45.62,00:26:45.62,Going to spin herself into a new spot.
448,00:26:55.12,00:26:55.12,"Lydia, which tile is she going to move?"
449,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"Cindy, surrounded by a sea of red."
450,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,No more tiles to flip over. Cindy can't move.
451,00:27:04.75,00:27:04.75,She's first one out of the game. Take a spot on the bench.
452,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,Steph is up. Steph's carved out a nice
453,00:27:14.38,00:27:14.38,"piece of real estate. Danni, your move."
454,00:27:19.54,00:27:19.54,>> Can I switch? >> JEFF: You can switch any time
455,00:27:24.33,00:27:24.33,you want. Immunity and a spot in the final
456,00:27:27.29,00:27:27.29,five is riding on this challenge.
457,00:27:29.88,00:27:29.88,>> I want to switch with Steph. >> JEFF: Danni uses her immunity
458,00:27:33.08,00:27:33.08,advantage. Steph doesn't like it.
459,00:27:35.42,00:27:35.42,"Danni, Steph, switch positions."
460,00:27:39.46,00:27:39.46,Only time will tell if it was the right move.
461,00:27:43.79,00:27:43.79,Lydia. Takes her last move.
462,00:27:47.62,00:27:47.62,>> Last move. >> JEFF: Step on it then take a
463,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,"spot on the bench next to Cindy. Lydia, second person out of"
464,00:27:54.04,00:27:54.04,the game. We're down to four.
465,00:27:56.46,00:27:56.46,"Danni, Judd, Rafe on one side of the board."
466,00:27:58.92,00:27:58.92,"Steph alone on the other. Judd, your move."
467,00:28:05.50,00:28:05.50,Rafe's turn. Starting to get interesting.
468,00:28:11.04,00:28:11.04,Danni. Steph.
469,00:28:20.71,00:28:20.71,Judd. Rafe.
470,00:28:28.00,00:28:28.00,Rafe and Danni closing in on the same tiles.
471,00:28:30.21,00:28:30.21,"Danni. Danni makes her move, and in"
472,00:28:36.46,00:28:36.46,"doing so, ends the game for Rafe, who has nowhere left to"
473,00:28:40.12,00:28:40.12,"move. >> Good job, Rafe."
474,00:28:42.04,00:28:42.04,>> JEFF: Rafe joins Lydia and Cindy on the bench.
475,00:28:44.67,00:28:44.67,We are down to three. Steph.
476,00:28:49.21,00:28:49.21,Judd. Judd makes his last move.
477,00:28:56.04,00:28:56.04,">> I've got one more. >> JEFF: Judd, you cannot move"
478,00:28:58.79,00:28:58.79,diagonally. Nowhere left to go.
479,00:29:00.92,00:29:00.92,You're out of the game. We're down to two.
480,00:29:06.29,00:29:06.29,Danni and Steph. Danni made Steph switch
481,00:29:09.71,00:29:09.71,"positions with her. Steph, only so many tiles"
482,00:29:13.29,00:29:13.29,left to work with. Just play it out now.
483,00:29:20.92,00:29:20.92,"Danni. With that, Steph has only one"
484,00:29:34.42,00:29:34.42,move left to make. Steph is out.
485,00:29:38.21,00:29:38.21,Danni wins immunity. Well played.
486,00:29:43.08,00:29:43.08,Well spent. >> Well spent.
487,00:29:44.58,00:29:44.58,">> JEFF: Money well spent. Danni, come on up."
488,00:29:47.75,00:29:47.75,(applause) A lot of things bid on at
489,00:29:50.33,00:29:50.33,that auction. Nothing more valuable than
490,00:29:53.58,00:29:53.58,this right now. >> I love this thing.
491,00:29:56.58,00:29:56.58,>> JEFF: Well played. You are safe tonight at
492,00:29:58.50,00:29:58.50,"Tribal Council. Steph, Judd, Cindy, Lydia,"
493,00:30:01.25,00:30:01.25,"Rafe, after 33 days, one of you is going home tonight."
494,00:30:05.12,00:30:05.12,See you at Tribal Council. Head on back to camp.
495,00:30:26.00,00:30:26.00,">> Good job. >> Good job, Danni."
496,00:30:28.33,00:30:28.33,>> Thank you. >> I don't know about you...
497,00:30:31.00,00:30:31.00,>> I thought I'd be going next for sure.
498,00:30:34.25,00:30:34.25,That was like the biggest immunity I could ever win.
499,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,There's lot of things going on right now.
500,00:30:41.04,00:30:41.04,So something may work out even more so in my favor tonight.
501,00:30:52.42,00:30:52.42,>> Where did Judd go? >> I'd like to believe Judd.
502,00:31:45.12,00:31:45.12,I believe Judd for the most part but already made clear that he's
503,00:31:48.50,00:31:48.50,playing this game and do anything to win.
504,00:31:50.38,00:31:50.38,He's already been caught in quite a few lies.
505,00:31:53.08,00:31:53.08,And Danni really hasn't lied at all.
506,00:32:00.29,00:32:00.29,>> Whoa. >> Said a million times he's
507,00:32:49.75,00:32:49.75,"like, ""I'm here to win. I'll do whatever it takes."""
508,00:32:52.29,00:32:52.29,>> We have to be... >> We've been trying to be
509,00:32:55.00,00:32:55.00,honest. >> For the most part.
510,00:32:56.50,00:32:56.50,>> Like I don't know... >> We were saying if he goes
511,00:32:59.38,00:32:59.38,tonight we'll want Lydia to go next then we'll go to the four.
512,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,>> Yeah. >> With Cindy.
513,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,">> Yeah. >> I mean, what do you think?"
514,00:33:07.00,00:33:07.00,What if Cindy... if we vote for
515,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,"Judd, they all vote for us. >> I think Lydia will vote for"
516,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,us. >> She said she would vote for
517,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,Judd. >> I think she would.
518,00:33:16.88,00:33:16.88,">> You do? And what, do we tell Cindy?"
519,00:33:19.04,00:33:19.04,>> What do you think? >> My heart tells me get rid of
520,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,Lydia because Judd and I have been really close.
521,00:33:24.17,00:33:24.17,">> At the same time, if someone is going to slit your throat"
522,00:33:27.62,00:33:27.62,"because they like your company, hell, no, they got to go."
523,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,">> I love Judd, though. I do."
524,00:33:33.71,00:33:33.71,I told his wife that we were sticking together.
525,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,"I feel horrible. But if he's likely to turn, I"
526,00:33:39.83,00:33:39.83,"can't... You know, I never..."
527,00:33:41.25,00:33:41.25,>> I basically told Stephenie what was going on now.
528,00:33:44.04,00:33:44.04,And now she's kinda thinking maybe we might vote Judd out
529,00:33:48.21,00:33:48.21,tonight. So hopefully my plan worked to
530,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,rat Judd out. >> Absolutely.
531,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,>> It's weird how the original plan was to take Danni out.
532,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"She won immunity on the day that she needed it, you know what I'm"
533,00:34:04.62,00:34:04.62,saying? I'm here if you want to use my
534,00:34:08.58,00:34:08.58,vote. If not.
535,00:34:10.83,00:34:10.83,Auf Wiedersehen. Arrivederci.
536,00:34:14.00,00:34:14.00,Sayonara. Good-bye.
537,00:34:16.08,00:34:16.08,>> Nobody is safe here tonight. If you think you're safe in this
538,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,"game, you're crazy. >> Yeah."
539,00:34:23.58,00:34:23.58,>> You're absolutely berserk. >> If anybody needs me for their
540,00:34:34.08,00:34:34.08,"vote, I'm here for them. You know what I'm sayin'?"
541,00:34:38.96,00:34:38.96,I'm not about to give up. I'm not about to quit.
542,00:34:59.71,00:34:59.71,">> We have alliance to me, Cindy, Stephenie and Rafe."
543,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,And we had agreed if Danni won immunity it's going to be Lydia.
544,00:35:09.79,00:35:09.79,">> Do you know if she's lied? >> She's working, man."
545,00:35:13.29,00:35:13.29,"I said it could be me, it could be you."
546,00:35:16.71,00:35:16.71,>> It could be Rafe. >> That's what I said.
547,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,I said it could be anybody here. >> That's funny.
548,00:35:23.50,00:35:23.50,">> No, it's not. But you got to say something."
549,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,"I mean, you can't just sit there."
550,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,You know what I mean? Jellybean?
551,00:35:32.12,00:35:32.12,">> I know what you mean, jellybean."
552,00:35:39.92,00:35:39.92,">> Yeah, I'll miss Lydia around camp."
553,00:35:42.46,00:35:42.46,"I'll miss her singing and dancing, all that."
554,00:35:45.25,00:35:45.25,But one other person goes I move up.
555,00:35:48.21,00:35:48.21,"No hard feelings. So, you know, pretty glad"
556,00:35:51.12,00:35:51.12,"somebody's going home right now. As long as it ain't me, man,"
557,00:35:54.75,00:35:54.75,I'll always have a smile on my face.
558,00:36:16.96,00:36:16.96,>> JEFF: We now bring in the members of our jury.
559,00:36:20.38,00:36:20.38,"Bobby Jon, Jamie, and Gary voted out last Tribal Council."
560,00:36:28.92,00:36:28.92,So let's talk about the loved ones.
561,00:36:31.42,00:36:31.42,"Steph, you and Michael have been going out seven years?"
562,00:36:34.38,00:36:34.38,>> Yes. >> JEFF: It had to be just
563,00:36:36.25,00:36:36.25,wonderful to have him out there and experience that with you.
564,00:36:39.12,00:36:39.12,">> Yeah, it was really special and really awesome because now"
565,00:36:43.46,00:36:43.46,"he can really understand what we've all been going through,"
566,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,"and it was just like, ""This sucks."""
567,00:36:48.54,00:36:48.54,"He's like, ""You guys are tough."" >> JEFF: Let's talk about the"
568,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,"immunity challenge. Danni, you are smiling from ear"
569,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,"to ear right now. >> Oh, my, gosh."
570,00:36:58.38,00:36:58.38,"When it came up in the auction to get the advantage, there was"
571,00:37:02.12,00:37:02.12,no way I was going to let that pass.
572,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,And fortunately it worked out. And like I started to cry.
573,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,I've cried twice over spaghetti and over immunity.
574,00:37:09.21,00:37:09.21,"So I was very, very happy and needed it."
575,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,">> JEFF: Cindy, take me through that process emotionally of how"
576,00:37:15.42,00:37:15.42,it becomes more difficult to vote tonight.
577,00:37:17.62,00:37:17.62,>> You have to consider the person you're voting out and how
578,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,their alliance is going to affect your alliance with
579,00:37:24.25,00:37:24.25,whoever is left. Also the person that's going
580,00:37:26.71,00:37:26.71,home is going to have some say if you end up in the final two
581,00:37:29.62,00:37:29.62,and whether or not you win. So you got 20 things going
582,00:37:32.12,00:37:32.12,through your head that you have to consider.
583,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,">> JEFF: Rafe, have you started to consider how it's going to be"
584,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,different after tonight's Tribal Council when you are now down to
585,00:37:41.58,00:37:41.58,"odd number, five. >> It's like, you don't know"
586,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"exactly who to trust, but you have to like kind of believe"
587,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,that you have the right gut feeling about who you can trust
588,00:37:50.62,00:37:50.62,around here. Because that's the only thing
589,00:37:52.79,00:37:52.79,that's going to get to you the end of the game at this point.
590,00:37:55.75,00:37:55.75,With this few people left you have to have strong trust to get
591,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,"to the end of the game. >> JEFF: Steph, how important is"
592,00:38:01.96,00:38:01.96,it to you how you vote somebody out of this game?
593,00:38:04.83,00:38:04.83,>> For me it's important to vote somebody out and know that
594,00:38:07.79,00:38:07.79,"you're making the right choice and be able to, if you make it"
595,00:38:10.92,00:38:10.92,"to the final two, to explain yourself."
596,00:38:12.83,00:38:12.83,Explain your reasoning behind it.
597,00:38:15.38,00:38:15.38,And it's hard. Because you let your emotions
598,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,get to you. We are all fighting for a
599,00:38:19.96,00:38:19.96,"million bucks, but we're like family."
600,00:38:22.04,00:38:22.04,"We really are. >> JEFF: Judd, somebody in this"
601,00:38:24.67,00:38:24.67,"family will be going tonight. >> Well, I tell what you, to be"
602,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,"honest with you, no matter what they all say, everybody wants"
603,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,"somebody to go home. I mean, they're sitting here"
604,00:38:34.08,00:38:34.08,"making believe like, oh, man, going to stink."
605,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"That's not the case, man. Everybody wants somebody to go"
606,00:38:39.50,00:38:39.50,home. That's the bottom line.
607,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,That's what we're here for. Only way you move on is somebody
608,00:38:43.54,00:38:43.54,"goes home. No hard feelings, but deal with"
609,00:38:45.58,00:38:45.58,it. That's basically the way I look
610,00:38:47.46,00:38:47.46,"at it. If somebody goes home, that's"
611,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,better for me. You just got to trust and love
612,00:38:51.58,00:38:51.58,"the ones you're with right now. >> JEFF: Danni, you paid a lot"
613,00:38:58.83,00:38:58.83,of money to get that immunity around your neck.
614,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,I can't imagine you're giving it up.
615,00:39:02.79,00:39:02.79,">> No, I think I'm going to keep it."
616,00:39:04.62,00:39:04.62,>> JEFF: Danni is the only one you cannot vote for.
617,00:39:07.21,00:39:07.21,Everybody else is fair game. Time to vote.
618,00:39:09.46,00:39:09.46,"Rafe, you're up. >> You're always saying we're a"
619,00:39:20.21,00:39:20.21,bunch of squirrels trying to get a nut.
620,00:39:22.25,00:39:22.25,"Well, sorry, I had to write your name down, but I had to do what"
621,00:39:26.00,00:39:26.00,"I had to do today. >> Hey, Lydia, you sang and you"
622,00:39:37.17,00:39:37.17,danced your way right out of the jungle.
623,00:39:40.25,00:39:40.25,Adios. >> JEFF: I'll tally the votes.
624,00:40:02.38,00:40:02.38,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
625,00:40:04.62,00:40:04.62,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
626,00:40:07.08,00:40:07.08,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
627,00:40:11.04,00:40:11.04,First vote: Judd. Lydia.
628,00:40:17.42,00:40:17.42,One vote Lydia. Lydia.
629,00:40:23.71,00:40:23.71,"Two votes Lydia, one vote Judd. Judd."
630,00:40:28.29,00:40:28.29,"Two votes Judd, two votes Lydia. Judd."
631,00:40:34.92,00:40:34.92,"That's three votes Judd, two votes Lydia."
632,00:40:38.58,00:40:38.58,One vote left. 13th person voted out of
633,00:40:48.96,00:40:48.96,"Survivor: Guatemala: Judd. >> Thanks, guys."
634,00:40:52.12,00:40:52.12,Hope you guys all get bit by a freakin' crocodile.
635,00:40:56.42,00:40:56.42,"Scumbags. >> JEFF: Judd, the Tribe has"
636,00:41:05.17,00:41:05.17,spoken. Time to go.
637,00:41:20.33,00:41:20.33,>> JEFF: After tonight's vote one thing should be very clear:
638,00:41:24.33,00:41:24.33,you can no longer rely on what used to be because this game
639,00:41:30.12,00:41:30.12,just took a change in a very big way.
640,00:41:33.50,00:41:33.50,Grab your torches. Go back to camp.
641,00:41:35.33,00:41:35.33,Good night. >> ANNOUNCER: Stay tuned for
642,00:41:49.17,00:41:49.17,scenes from our next episode. >> JEFF: Next time on Survivor:
643,00:41:56.83,00:41:56.83,">> I see a little pattern there, and it makes me uncomfortable."
644,00:41:59.38,00:41:59.38,>> JEFF: Cindy is consoled after Tribal Council.
645,00:42:01.46,00:42:01.46,>> He's not privileged of the information.
646,00:42:04.08,00:42:04.08,>> Really? >> JEFF: The strategy deepens.
647,00:42:06.33,00:42:06.33,>> That's tough decision. >> JEFF: And the tribe is
648,00:42:10.04,00:42:10.04,"shocked with an awful dilemma. >> Oh, my God."
649,00:42:18.88,00:42:18.88,">> I'm really pissed off. I mean, I feel I was pissed on,"
650,00:42:22.12,00:42:22.12,"pissed off, lied to, betrayed. It doesn't feel good being"
651,00:42:25.17,00:42:25.17,"blind-sided and it sucks being lied to, man, because one thing"
652,00:42:27.38,00:42:27.38,"I didn't do was lie to anybody, man."
653,00:42:28.83,00:42:28.83,"Hey, get rid of the biggest target, and that's what they"
654,00:42:30.96,00:42:30.96,"did, man. So, I really believe that you"
655,00:42:32.33,00:42:32.33,"are a bunch of scumbags, and I can't wait till the final two,"
656,00:42:34.58,00:42:34.58,"man. I'll have a lot more to say than that, man."
