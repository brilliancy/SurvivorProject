2,00:00:01.10,00:00:01.10,PROBST:   Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.63,00:00:02.63, Sook Jai remained  a tribe divided.
4,00:00:04.50,00:00:04.50,Stephanie and Jed have not worked on the hut very much.
5,00:00:07.80,00:00:07.80,"PROBST: At Chuay Gahn,  Jan and Helen got lost while"
6,00:00:10.23,00:00:10.23, the guys had all the fun.
7,00:00:11.50,00:00:11.50,"-Oh, baby! -Go!   -At the reward challenge,"
8,00:00:15.40,00:00:15.40, Sook Jai won  a large fishing net...
9,00:00:16.37,00:00:16.37,Sook Jai wins!
10,00:00:17.73,00:00:17.73,"-(team whooping) -We're eatin' fish, guys!"
11,00:00:19.67,00:00:19.67,PROBST: ...despite losing  for the second time
12,00:00:22.27,00:00:22.27, and Tanya's ongoing illness...
13,00:00:23.47,00:00:23.47,"No, I will throw up."
14,00:00:24.87,00:00:24.87,PROBST: ...Chuay Gahn tried  to keep hope alive.
15,00:00:27.03,00:00:27.03,"We're gonna get 'em, that's all I can say."
16,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97,"PROBST:   At the immunity challenge,"
17,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20, they almost pulled it off.
18,00:00:31.73,00:00:31.73,"Come on, come on, come on."
19,00:00:32.83,00:00:32.83," It was a tight race  until the end,"
20,00:00:34.60,00:00:34.60, when Sook Jai claimed  another victory...
21,00:00:36.23,00:00:36.23,Yeah!
22,00:00:37.57,00:00:37.57, ...sending Chuay Gahn back  to Tribal Council
23,00:00:39.87,00:00:39.87, where Tanya's illness finally  caught up with her.
24,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60,The tribe has spoken.
25,00:00:46.43,00:00:46.43, 14 are left.
26,00:00:48.43,00:00:48.43, Who will be the next to go?
27,00:02:08.00,00:02:08.00,CLAY: We've had two  immunity challenges;
28,00:02:10.07,00:02:10.07," we've lost that and a war  challenge, we've lost that."
29,00:02:11.70,00:02:11.70,"But, yes, our tribe's a family,  there's no doubt about it."
30,00:02:14.80,00:02:14.80, And we're happy.
31,00:02:16.10,00:02:16.10, We understood each other's  personalities.
32,00:02:18.40,00:02:18.40, We liked each other's  personalities.
33,00:02:20.43,00:02:20.43,It was a-a immediate bond.
34,00:02:22.47,00:02:22.47,Everybody...
35,00:02:23.70,00:02:23.70,"The personalities didn't clash, they clicked."
36,00:02:26.83,00:02:26.83,Are those your real color eyes there?
37,00:02:28.70,00:02:28.70,"-Mm-hmm. -Oh, okay."
38,00:02:29.67,00:02:29.67,-They just brown. -Cool.
39,00:02:31.10,00:02:31.10, GHANDIA: I was happy that Ted  was on my same team.
40,00:02:35.03,00:02:35.03,This is the longest I have ever been away from my husband.
41,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23," He's my best friend,  my homeboy, everything to me."
42,00:02:42.47,00:02:42.47," And Ted brings that home  to me, you know?"
43,00:02:46.83,00:02:46.83," It's kind of like my husband's  here with me chilling,"
44,00:02:49.80,00:02:49.80, and that really  made me feel good.
45,00:02:52.13,00:02:52.13,And he's so good to hug. (laughs)
46,00:02:55.03,00:02:55.03," He's just, he's just cool."
47,00:03:36.53,00:03:36.53,ROBB: This has  definitely got to be
48,00:03:38.10,00:03:38.10," the weakest  I've ever felt in my life,"
49,00:03:39.57,00:03:39.57, the most fatigued and most  drained I've ever felt.
50,00:03:42.80,00:03:42.80,None of us have the energy to do anything.
51,00:03:47.50,00:03:47.50,"My feet, they're just blistered all to heck, peeling off."
52,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,WOMAN: That is the biggest blister I've ever seen.
53,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93," SHII ANN:  We're horrible campers,"
54,00:03:56.30,00:03:56.30, we're terrible outdoorsmen.
55,00:03:59.37,00:03:59.37,We are starving!
56,00:04:01.80,00:04:01.80,We're starving.
57,00:04:03.03,00:04:03.03,"Look at me, I'm, like, Ally McBeal size."
58,00:04:08.30,00:04:08.30,"So far, we haven't been very successful"
59,00:04:11.20,00:04:11.20,getting fish in the net.
60,00:04:12.60,00:04:12.60,Whether or not we're doing something wrong--
61,00:04:14.07,00:04:14.07, I'm not sure--  so I'm not so sure
62,00:04:17.13,00:04:17.13, how rewarding  that net is to us.
63,00:04:19.90,00:04:19.90,I'd like a big plate of cheese and crackers.
64,00:04:22.07,00:04:22.07,(chuckles)
65,00:04:25.40,00:04:25.40, You know what?
66,00:04:26.53,00:04:26.53, We got the net  in that challenge
67,00:04:28.00,00:04:28.00, and we're trying to figure out  how to make it work.
68,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"Nobody's ever lived on the beach,"
69,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,nobody's ever been around the water.
70,00:04:34.27,00:04:34.27, We don't really know how  to work it.
71,00:04:38.67,00:04:38.67,All that work for nothing.
72,00:04:40.10,00:04:40.10,"Wait, we have one."
73,00:04:43.37,00:04:43.37,JED: Nice.
74,00:04:44.40,00:04:44.40,"You know, it's kind of strange"
75,00:04:47.73,00:04:47.73,to be out here and see where all the fish comes from
76,00:04:50.87,00:04:50.87,that I eat every day at home...
77,00:04:54.90,00:04:54.90,...and not have any idea how to get it. (chuckles)
78,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87,GHANDIA: I feel a little tired  because I didn't get
79,00:05:18.43,00:05:18.43, a lot of sleep last night.
80,00:05:20.30,00:05:20.30,"I just feel kind of depressed, and I feel..."
81,00:05:22.97,00:05:22.97, I feel used.
82,00:05:24.03,00:05:24.03,"BRIAN: Oh, wow, it's the real deal."
83,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,TED: Can I sit next to the diva?
84,00:05:26.97,00:05:26.97,GHANDIA: Sure.
85,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83," Ted and I have gotten close,"
86,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47, and it always seems that  I'm sleeping next to him.
87,00:05:33.10,00:05:33.10," And so, last night,  he threw his arm over me"
88,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70," and really pulled me close  into him,"
89,00:05:40.37,00:05:40.37," which was kind of okay with me  in the beginning, but, um,"
90,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,"he started to, like, really..."
91,00:05:46.40,00:05:46.40,"uh, become very, kind of, sexual."
92,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,"I mean, specifically, he was grinding against, against me."
93,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80, And he didn't stop.
94,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37, He kept trying to--  in my opinion-- engage me.
95,00:06:08.07,00:06:08.07, I think Ted's actions
96,00:06:10.67,00:06:10.67,are inappropriate because he's married
97,00:06:13.37,00:06:13.37,"and because he just had a baby, like, two weeks ago."
98,00:06:16.67,00:06:16.67,And also because he should respect me as a married woman
99,00:06:20.33,00:06:20.33,"and respect my marriage, also."
100,00:06:26.10,00:06:26.10, You can't just  do Ghandia like that.
101,00:06:28.03,00:06:28.03, You can't... I mean...
102,00:06:29.97,00:06:29.97,I'm just not gonna go for it.
103,00:06:33.93,00:06:33.93,"You went up on me last night, tough."
104,00:06:36.27,00:06:36.27,"That's, that's, like, you know what I do?"
105,00:06:38.33,00:06:38.33,"Sometimes when I'm sleeping, you know, it's like"
106,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,"in the middle of the night, I'm not, like, totally clear."
107,00:06:44.37,00:06:44.37,"I'm thinking I'm sleeping with my wife, so I think what we need"
108,00:06:47.27,00:06:47.27,"to do is I'm not gonna hug you, I'm not gonna hold you"
109,00:06:50.40,00:06:50.40,"because I keep on forgetting that I'm,"
110,00:06:51.57,00:06:51.57,"like, not in the bed with my wife."
111,00:06:52.93,00:06:52.93,"-Right, right, right. -So I'm, like..."
112,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23,"But it was really compromising for me,"
113,00:06:56.87,00:06:56.87,and I just feel like such trash today.
114,00:06:58.83,00:06:58.83,"Don't, because, I mean, when I do that, I'm not thinking..."
115,00:07:03.37,00:07:03.37,"I'm not, like, in my total mind trying to,"
116,00:07:05.53,00:07:05.53,"like, start something with you,"
117,00:07:06.70,00:07:06.70,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
118,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,...and I apologize if I've offended you.
119,00:07:09.80,00:07:09.80,GHANDIA: Yeah.
120,00:07:11.27,00:07:11.27,"I mean, it wasn't done maliciously, it wasn't done"
121,00:07:13.93,00:07:13.93,trying to start something or anything like that.
122,00:07:15.00,00:07:15.00,GHANDIA: Mm-hmm.
123,00:07:16.27,00:07:16.27,"Please, from the bottom of my heart, I do apologize."
124,00:07:19.77,00:07:19.77,Why are you crying? What's wrong?
125,00:07:21.40,00:07:21.40,-Because... -What's wrong?
126,00:07:23.10,00:07:23.10,Because that's happened to me before.
127,00:07:25.87,00:07:25.87,Did it really? Honestly?
128,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,"I was raped before, in college."
129,00:07:29.63,00:07:29.63,-Were you really? -Mm-hmm.
130,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,Get out of here.
131,00:07:32.37,00:07:32.37,"Yeah, I think... I apologize."
132,00:07:34.37,00:07:34.37,And I've had people tell me that I bring it on myself and stuff.
133,00:07:37.43,00:07:37.43,"-No... -And for a minute this morning,"
134,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,I thought were you gonna try to pretend like it didn't happen.
135,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,"No, uh-uh. I was planning on talking to you later on,"
136,00:07:43.77,00:07:43.77,"but I didn't have, like, an opportunity..."
137,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,-I'm sorry. -...to talk to you about it.
138,00:07:46.90,00:07:46.90,I'm really glad you apologized. That makes me feel a lot better.
139,00:07:49.40,00:07:49.40,"No, seriously, I apologize a million times."
140,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,"-Okay, okay. -Can you forgive me?"
141,00:07:53.03,00:07:53.03,"-Yes, I can. -Okay, all right."
142,00:07:55.70,00:07:55.70,Thank you. Seriously.
143,00:07:57.17,00:07:57.17,"-You're a good person, Ted. -And don't worry."
144,00:07:59.40,00:07:59.40,You don't have to worry about that ever happening again.
145,00:08:01.77,00:08:01.77,-Okay. -You got it?
146,00:08:03.57,00:08:03.57,-All right. -Uh-huh.
147,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,TED:  We've always been a family
148,00:08:07.90,00:08:07.90, and we'll continue  to be a family.
149,00:08:09.63,00:08:09.63,Even though this incident does exist within our family--
150,00:08:12.53,00:08:12.53,"quote, unquote ""family""--"
151,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63, I think we can pull together.
152,00:08:15.77,00:08:15.77, I think we all are gonna give  110% in the challenges.
153,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67,"We've got some ass-kicking to do, fellers."
154,00:08:22.07,00:08:22.07,Right.
155,00:08:31.70,00:08:31.70,"PROBST: Welcome, guys."
156,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,"-TED: What's up, Jeff? -GHANDIA: Thank you."
157,00:08:34.77,00:08:34.77,"Well, as you may or may not know, as recently as the 1960s,"
158,00:08:39.20,00:08:39.20,this island was ruled by pirates
159,00:08:41.07,00:08:41.07,who would rob and steal from passing boats.
160,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47,That ties in to today's challenge.
161,00:08:45.20,00:08:45.20,Today's challenge is a race along this bamboo course.
162,00:08:47.70,00:08:47.70,"At the end of the course, two boats-- one for each tribe."
163,00:08:51.00,00:08:51.00,Your goal: rob or steal ten items
164,00:08:55.10,00:08:55.10,"from the other tribe's boat, back to your boat."
165,00:08:57.47,00:08:57.47,First tribe to do so wins.
166,00:08:58.93,00:08:58.93,Here are the rules:
167,00:09:00.03,00:09:00.03,You can only take one item at a time.
168,00:09:01.97,00:09:01.97,You can only have two members on a course at any time.
169,00:09:05.23,00:09:05.23,"If you fall off, you lose the item you were carrying"
170,00:09:08.43,00:09:08.43,and you go back to the start.
171,00:09:10.20,00:09:10.20,"In the center of the course, there's an attack zone."
172,00:09:12.20,00:09:12.20,It is clearly marked in black-and-gold cloth.
173,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"If you are in the attack zone,"
174,00:09:17.10,00:09:17.10,you can engage contact with somebody else who is
175,00:09:20.03,00:09:20.03,also in the attack zone
176,00:09:21.63,00:09:21.63,and try to push them off the course into the water.
177,00:09:24.23,00:09:24.23,"If you are not in the attack zone when you engage contact,"
178,00:09:26.97,00:09:26.97,you're out of the game.
179,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,And one item from your tribe's boat goes
180,00:09:30.47,00:09:30.47,into the other tribe's boat.
181,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67,Want to know what you're playing for?
182,00:09:33.77,00:09:33.77,"-Yes, sir. -Yes."
183,00:09:34.77,00:09:34.77,Bring it in!
184,00:09:37.90,00:09:37.90,Here's your reward.
185,00:09:43.10,00:09:43.10,For 24 hours you will have two Red Berets: Thai Special Forces.
186,00:09:48.37,00:09:48.37,These guys know how to live off this land.
187,00:09:51.00,00:09:51.00,"You can use them to help improve your shelter,"
188,00:09:52.80,00:09:52.80,fix a boat or source every bit of edible food in your camp.
189,00:09:57.87,00:09:57.87,"So when this is done,"
190,00:09:59.03,00:09:59.03,you ought to know how to do this for yourself.
191,00:10:02.00,00:10:02.00,(all agreeing cheerfully)
192,00:10:06.17,00:10:06.17,"Thanks, guys. See you in a little bit."
193,00:10:08.00,00:10:08.00,"Sook Jai, because you have two extra members,"
194,00:10:09.47,00:10:09.47,you're sitting two out.
195,00:10:10.80,00:10:10.80,Who's sitting? Jake and Erin.
196,00:10:12.40,00:10:12.40,Take your spots. Wait for my go.
197,00:10:15.43,00:10:15.43,"Here we go, guys, great reward at stake."
198,00:10:17.93,00:10:17.93,-Survivors ready? -Yeah!

402,00:18:49.37,00:18:49.37,I kind of thought that the excuse he gave me was
403,00:18:51.60,00:18:51.60,a little bit disingenuous; a lot disingenuous.
404,00:18:53.43,00:18:53.43,"He said, ""Is it okay if I hold you?"""
405,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,"HELEN: Well, and we're all in there so close, yeah."
406,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,"I said, ""Yeah, that's fine, because that comforts me."""
407,00:18:59.13,00:18:59.13,"HELEN: Right, and you don't want"
408,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,"to act like you can't handle the situation, you know?"
409,00:19:02.33,00:19:02.33,-That makes you look bad. -Right.
410,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67, So I just started telling  everybody in the tribe
411,00:19:06.60,00:19:06.60, what happened because I felt  that everybody in the tribe
412,00:19:09.27,00:19:09.27, should know what he did.
413,00:19:11.83,00:19:11.83,And I was a little hard on him
414,00:19:13.47,00:19:13.47,in retelling the story to everybody.
415,00:19:16.57,00:19:16.57,"So then when he moved his hand on my shoulder,"
416,00:19:18.67,00:19:18.67,"he started biting me on my shoulder, back here,"
417,00:19:20.83,00:19:20.83,"like sexy biting, you know how you bite somebody's..."
418,00:19:23.03,00:19:23.03,-Mm-hmm. -Then it was on from there.
419,00:19:24.87,00:19:24.87,"I was, like, ""This is some ...."
420,00:19:26.70,00:19:26.70,"""Your wife just had a baby a ... week ago,"
421,00:19:29.00,00:19:29.00,"""and you bump ... on my ass?"
422,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,"You're happily married."""
423,00:19:31.50,00:19:31.50,But every part of the story that I told was true.
424,00:19:33.90,00:19:33.90,The only part that I think
425,00:19:35.33,00:19:35.33,that I think I probably left out is that he apologized.
426,00:20:02.63,00:20:02.63,"I wake up at the end of my little nap,"
427,00:20:05.03,00:20:05.03,"after I delegate my duties,"
428,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80, and there's no fishing net  to be found.
429,00:20:20.13,00:20:20.13," Me and Robb walked around  the beach in search for it,"
430,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03," and basically,  whoever last was watching it"
431,00:20:26.47,00:20:26.47,"just didn't delegate off duties, and let it drift away."
432,00:20:30.93,00:20:30.93," ROBB: We figured if we left  the net out for a while,"
433,00:20:34.60,00:20:34.60, we might catch some fish
434,00:20:36.30,00:20:36.30,and we might eat and feel good.
435,00:20:38.07,00:20:38.07,"Well, the damn net floated away."
436,00:20:40.57,00:20:40.57,We don't know where the net is. (chuckles)
437,00:20:42.90,00:20:42.90,"PENNY: Tell you what, I sure would feel ten times better"
438,00:20:46.57,00:20:46.57,"-if I could eat something. -I would, too."
439,00:20:49.07,00:20:49.07,-We found some sour berries. -Cool.
440,00:20:52.70,00:20:52.70,"Well, we got some great news."
441,00:20:54.27,00:20:54.27,We've lost the net.
442,00:20:56.60,00:20:56.60,What?
443,00:20:57.87,00:20:57.87,We don't have a clue where that net is.
444,00:21:01.80,00:21:01.80,PENNY: That sucks.
445,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73," Those boys took  the fishing net out,"
446,00:21:07.63,00:21:07.63,"""We're gonna leave it out in the ocean for hours and hours."""
447,00:21:10.50,00:21:10.50," Okay, we come back, it's gone."
448,00:21:13.07,00:21:13.07, Why?
449,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,Jed was sleeping.
450,00:21:15.80,00:21:15.80,"So, because Jed was sleeping and unwilling to get up,"
451,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83, the fishing net went bye-bye.
452,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60, It just sailed away.
453,00:22:03.20,00:22:03.20,"HELEN: Yeah, yeah, wrong, yeah."
454,00:22:04.63,00:22:04.63,(Ted laughs)
455,00:22:12.30,00:22:12.30,HELEN: Today is the first day  that I really realized
456,00:22:15.63,00:22:15.63, I'm playing Survivor.
457,00:22:16.87,00:22:16.87," I know that sounds silly,"
458,00:22:18.23,00:22:18.23, but I guess  I got in the mode out here
459,00:22:20.57,00:22:20.57, where I was surviving  off the land; I really did.
460,00:22:26.03,00:22:26.03,"I've been focusing on that, and forgetting that there's a game"
461,00:22:30.73,00:22:30.73,going on here psychologically.
462,00:22:32.70,00:22:32.70,And you could have blown me away with the Ted and Ghandia thing.
463,00:22:35.70,00:22:35.70,"-What? -It's kind of serious, yeah."
464,00:22:37.70,00:22:37.70,That's why she's been depressed all day.
465,00:22:39.57,00:22:39.57,"-Wow. -I guess it got pretty bad, so..."
466,00:22:42.63,00:22:42.63,I was completely asleep.
467,00:22:43.93,00:22:43.93,"And she said-- you know, me, too."
468,00:22:45.60,00:22:45.60,"-I didn't even know. -I didn't know either, yeah."
469,00:22:47.70,00:22:47.70,"That's highly depressing. Okay, I hear you."
470,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,"I agree. I feel the same way because, all of a sudden,"
471,00:22:51.43,00:22:51.43,the person I thought I was dealing with
472,00:22:53.13,00:22:53.13,is absolutely not the person I'm dealing with.
473,00:22:54.40,00:22:54.40,Whew.
474,00:22:55.60,00:22:55.60,So...
475,00:22:57.97,00:22:57.97,I just don't think that's cool.
476,00:22:59.83,00:22:59.83,"Um, but I'm just letting you know what we're gonna do,"
477,00:23:03.77,00:23:03.77,the three of us are gonna take him out next time.
478,00:23:05.53,00:23:05.53,"Okay, okay."
479,00:23:06.90,00:23:06.90,Just letting you know that and where we are.
480,00:23:09.00,00:23:09.00, It was quite a surprise when  it got back to me that there's
481,00:23:11.93,00:23:11.93,"a problem with Ghandia and Ted, and I'm, like, I'm just,"
482,00:23:15.47,00:23:15.47,the first thing I'm thinking is that I'm highly disappointed
483,00:23:17.53,00:23:17.53,at some of these actions.
484,00:23:18.90,00:23:18.90, But I don't know  what was happening
485,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63, or what wasn't happening.
486,00:23:22.13,00:23:22.13, I wanted to sit back and hear  both sides of the story.
487,00:23:24.90,00:23:24.90,"-All right, let me digest this. -Yep."
488,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,"-We'll talk about it tomorrow. -That's fine, that's fine."
489,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83,"-Thank you, Helen. -Yeah, yeah."
490,00:23:34.03,00:23:34.03,"(sighs) Oh, boy."
491,00:23:35.80,00:23:35.80,I'm coming.
492,00:23:47.53,00:23:47.53,TED: So they're making that soup.
493,00:23:49.13,00:23:49.13,It seems like they just keep adding and adding
494,00:23:51.57,00:23:51.57,and adding and adding.
495,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,-Adding more stuff? -Yeah.
496,00:23:54.17,00:23:54.17,"BRIAN: I think one of the  most important skills,"
497,00:23:56.47,00:23:56.47,"especially out here,"
498,00:23:57.57,00:23:57.57,"is just listening, taking it all in,"
499,00:24:00.73,00:24:00.73, not saying much.
500,00:24:02.03,00:24:02.03," Even when you're hungry  as heck,"
501,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73," hot as heck,  the emotions are high,"
502,00:24:05.93,00:24:05.93, you've got to remember  to keep that character cool.
503,00:24:09.70,00:24:09.70,"Like Cool Hand Luke, just keep it cool."
504,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,"Nothing happened, right?"
505,00:24:15.70,00:24:15.70,"-A long story. -Yeah, okay."
506,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,Long story.
507,00:24:21.07,00:24:21.07,"I'll just put, I'll just say it this way..."
508,00:24:22.70,00:24:22.70,"I mean, I'm a man, man of my word."
509,00:24:24.90,00:24:24.90,"I mean, a mistake happened, and I rectified it."
510,00:24:28.07,00:24:28.07,-Good. Good. -So...
511,00:24:29.87,00:24:29.87,"-Honest mistake. -Nothing happened, though, right?"
512,00:24:31.27,00:24:31.27,"-No, nothing at all. -Good."
513,00:24:32.33,00:24:32.33,-Nothing happened at all. -Good.
514,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37,That's all I need to hear. That's all I need to hear.
515,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,"That's the thing that's tripping me out, man-- know what I mean?"
516,00:24:38.47,00:24:38.47,All I need to hear.
517,00:24:40.23,00:24:40.23,That's all I need to hear-- nothing happened.
518,00:24:41.30,00:24:41.30,"Ted told me that nothing happened,"
519,00:24:43.80,00:24:43.80,"which he was denying anything happened,"
520,00:24:47.13,00:24:47.13,which is fine because nothing did happen.
521,00:24:49.27,00:24:49.27," I interpreted it as they  might've been close,"
522,00:24:51.00,00:24:51.00, but there was no contact.
523,00:24:52.50,00:24:52.50,There might've been a hand here  or a ankle here
524,00:24:54.77,00:24:54.77,or an earlobe here or something  simple as that.
525,00:24:56.90,00:24:56.90,Case closed.
526,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40,What's the side you're getting-- just denial
527,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,or that she came on to him?
528,00:25:01.70,00:25:01.70,"Um, no, just more denial."
529,00:25:03.03,00:25:03.03,"Yeah, okay."
530,00:25:04.67,00:25:04.67," And then as Helen was walking  by me, I mentioned"
531,00:25:07.23,00:25:07.23, that he denied everything;  he said nothing happened.
532,00:25:08.97,00:25:08.97,"I didn't realize that Helen would run right back to her,"
533,00:25:12.03,00:25:12.03, but I was surprised she went  right back to Ghandia
534,00:25:13.97,00:25:13.97," and said, ""Brian said that Ted  told him nothing happened."""
535,00:25:15.67,00:25:15.67,(wry laughter)
536,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,He didn't do anything.
537,00:25:17.77,00:25:17.77,So... you got a knife in your hand.
538,00:25:19.63,00:25:19.63,He didn't do anything.
539,00:25:20.90,00:25:20.90, I want to just punch  his ass in the eye.
540,00:25:23.70,00:25:23.70,"-He didn't do anything. -Now, if it comes down to..."
541,00:25:26.00,00:25:26.00,"-He didn't do nothing? -No, no, it never happened."
542,00:25:28.20,00:25:28.20,"I guess it was a figment of your imagination, yeah."
543,00:25:30.43,00:25:30.43,"No, no."
544,00:25:32.40,00:25:32.40,"Ghandia, I wouldn't..."
545,00:25:36.47,00:25:36.47, I heard from Helen  that Ted told Brian
546,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80," that nothing happened,  and something did happen,"
547,00:25:41.87,00:25:41.87," which really,  really set me off."
548,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,(screams)
549,00:25:49.63,00:25:49.63,What was that?
550,00:25:52.17,00:25:52.17,TED: What the ... was that? What?
551,00:25:53.97,00:25:53.97,I-I... It's... just-just crazy lady.
552,00:25:58.20,00:25:58.20,(grunting)
553,00:26:01.43,00:26:01.43,CLAY: That was  the most childish act
554,00:26:03.30,00:26:03.30, she's done so far here.
555,00:26:04.87,00:26:04.87,Ghandia gonna go down to the beach and cry
556,00:26:06.50,00:26:06.50,and holler and carry on.
557,00:26:08.07,00:26:08.07,"My two-year-old did that one time,"
558,00:26:09.90,00:26:09.90,and I whupped its ass and put it back in bed.
559,00:26:12.47,00:26:12.47,Bastard!
560,00:26:14.47,00:26:14.47,Piece of ...!
561,00:26:16.73,00:26:16.73,Pig.
562,00:26:18.37,00:26:18.37,Liar!
563,00:26:20.07,00:26:20.07,Cheat!
564,00:26:22.50,00:26:22.50,Butt crack showing every damn day.
565,00:26:28.97,00:26:28.97,"Rambo, if you could only understand"
566,00:26:30.50,00:26:30.50,how much bull... going on around this camp.
567,00:26:32.43,00:26:32.43,You don't understand.
568,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,"Actually, it's good that you don't understand what's going on"
569,00:26:36.27,00:26:36.27,'cause there's a lot of bull... going on.
570,00:26:41.50,00:26:41.50,(muttering angrily)
571,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43,You lying piece of...
572,00:26:46.87,00:26:46.87,Sorry.
573,00:26:49.83,00:26:49.83,TED:  Ghandia was making an issue
574,00:26:51.50,00:26:51.50," that was very, very small,"
575,00:26:53.30,00:26:53.30,that could have been handled in
576,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,"a very professional, one-on-one manner,"
577,00:26:56.20,00:26:56.20,and has exploded it into an issue
578,00:26:58.97,00:26:58.97, that goes beyond me  and beyond this game.
579,00:27:02.37,00:27:02.37,"Ghandia, I think we need to have a talk in front of everyone."
580,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,"Oh, for real, yeah."
581,00:27:06.27,00:27:06.27,"I think so, too."
582,00:27:07.53,00:27:07.53,I think the sooner the better.
583,00:27:08.93,00:27:08.93,"Mm-hmm, I'd like it to happen right now."
584,00:27:10.80,00:27:10.80,You want to have it now?
585,00:27:12.33,00:27:12.33,"-Mm-hmm. -All right, cool. Okay."
586,00:27:14.20,00:27:14.20,"Yo, Brian, Janny, we're gonna have a talk!"
587,00:27:21.23,00:27:21.23, I told all the tribe members  to come in together
588,00:27:24.37,00:27:24.37,"'cause I was tired of all this, you know, rumors going around"
589,00:27:28.47,00:27:28.47,"and people getting confused on what the facts are, et cetera."
590,00:27:31.53,00:27:31.53,"The other night, I was waking up when the event happened;"
591,00:27:35.77,00:27:35.77,"I was waking up, and from some crazy reason,"
592,00:27:40.50,00:27:40.50,"you know, in that position, I started grinding on Ghandia,"
593,00:27:45.60,00:27:45.60,"maybe two or three times, before realizing"
594,00:27:47.73,00:27:47.73,"""Whoa, sh... this isn't my wife."""
595,00:27:49.07,00:27:49.07,"We talked about it, and I said to Ghandia,"
596,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,"""I am totally apologize and I explained to her exactly"
597,00:27:54.27,00:27:54.27,"what happened, the same way I'm explaining to you guys."
598,00:27:56.63,00:27:56.63,"And what sparked this meeting,"
599,00:27:58.13,00:27:58.13,"I hear Ghandia saying that, you know, I'm denying it."
600,00:28:00.83,00:28:00.83,I am not denying ...
601,00:28:02.63,00:28:02.63,You didn't deny it to Brian? You didn't say ...?
602,00:28:04.57,00:28:04.57,I didn't deny ...
603,00:28:05.57,00:28:05.57,I am not denying ...!
604,00:28:07.63,00:28:07.63,Helen told me that you denied it to Brian.
605,00:28:09.87,00:28:09.87,"Well, that's what you get for listening to other people"
606,00:28:11.60,00:28:11.60,when I told you in your face.
607,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27,"Here's my, here's my issue of clarification:"
608,00:28:14.43,00:28:14.43,You said that you woke up
609,00:28:15.70,00:28:15.70,-and you realized that you were making a mistake. -Yes.
610,00:28:17.80,00:28:17.80,"So you didn't bite me on the back of my shoulder,"
611,00:28:19.90,00:28:19.90,-you didn't kiss me on my shoulder? -No.
612,00:28:21.57,00:28:21.57,You didn't put your hand in my head and rub my hair?
613,00:28:24.07,00:28:24.07,"Please. Come on. Ghandia, you're blowing it."
614,00:28:25.43,00:28:25.43,"And then when I changed positions again, you put your"
615,00:28:27.67,00:28:27.67,hand in my hair and you was massaging my head.
616,00:28:29.73,00:28:29.73,"-No. -You was trying... To me, I got the feeling"
617,00:28:31.47,00:28:31.47,that you was trying to get with me.
618,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,"No, no. First of all,"
619,00:28:35.37,00:28:35.37,-I don't need to get with you. -I know you don't.
620,00:28:37.47,00:28:37.47,"Second of all, I'm not even attracted to you."
621,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"So, I mean, it's not, it's not even about that."
622,00:28:43.53,00:28:43.53,"I am, I am 150 to 200% happy with the wife that I have,"
623,00:28:50.73,00:28:50.73,that I've chose to spend the rest of my life with.
624,00:28:53.37,00:28:53.37,"I mean, that's my love right there."
625,00:28:56.23,00:28:56.23,"And I have a daughter, that's my ... love."
626,00:28:59.33,00:28:59.33,Your version of what happened...
627,00:29:03.00,00:29:03.00,"I just, I just want you to be honest, but you don't remember."
628,00:29:06.57,00:29:06.57,You don't remember biting me on my shoulder;
629,00:29:08.77,00:29:08.77,you don't remember kissing me on my shoulder?
630,00:29:11.40,00:29:11.40,Ghandia. Ghandia...
631,00:29:12.47,00:29:12.47,That just made me uncomfortable. Hold on.
632,00:29:13.90,00:29:13.90,And then the excuse that you gave me that you were in a fog
633,00:29:16.97,00:29:16.97,"and you thought that I was your wife,"
634,00:29:18.67,00:29:18.67,I thought that that was disingenuous.
635,00:29:19.87,00:29:19.87,I thought that that was disingenuous.
636,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,That's funny because your comment after I apologized was
637,00:29:23.27,00:29:23.27,"to cry and say, ""You know, I really, really needed that"
638,00:29:25.53,00:29:25.53,"and I really appreciate your honesty."""
639,00:29:26.87,00:29:26.87,"I did, I did."
640,00:29:28.83,00:29:28.83,"So if you didn't feel that I was disingenuous,"
641,00:29:31.50,00:29:31.50,"then you would have, you would have addressed it"
642,00:29:33.43,00:29:33.43,"right then and said,"
643,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,"""Look, Ted, I don't believe your apologies."""
644,00:29:36.23,00:29:36.23,"All-all it is now is that it's all out on the table,"
645,00:29:38.40,00:29:38.40,it's all out in the open.
646,00:29:39.60,00:29:39.60,-We all understand what happened. -Ghandia...
647,00:29:41.20,00:29:41.20,"And then from here, we just go and we just start,"
648,00:29:43.43,00:29:43.43,and we just go on from here.
649,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,"It's in front of everybody and it's off, it's over."
650,00:29:48.70,00:29:48.70,"I agree, I agree with this clean slate."
651,00:29:50.87,00:29:50.87,Let's go fishing.
652,00:29:52.73,00:29:52.73,"Again, once again, last time, I apologize for everyone, okay?"
653,00:29:56.30,00:29:56.30,It's a new day. Let's start it right now.
654,00:29:58.00,00:29:58.00,Cool.

657,00:30:06.63,00:30:06.63,"or we didn't have this circle,"
658,00:30:07.93,00:30:07.93," this meeting that we had,"
659,00:30:09.80,00:30:09.80,I think it would have fractured  the tribe completely.
660,00:30:13.57,00:30:13.57,But I think we put a Band-Aid on it for right now.
661,00:30:16.30,00:30:16.30,"Everyone, everybody happy?"
662,00:30:20.33,00:30:20.33,Yes! Yes.

684,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53,All I know is that the majority  of us don't really care

794,00:36:23.20,00:36:23.20,He's just flat-out lazy.
795,00:36:24.53,00:36:24.53,He doesn't do anything.

798,00:36:29.30,00:36:29.30,"for the most part, he was lazy in the beginning,"
799,00:36:31.43,00:36:31.43,and he did a lot of things that pissed a lot of people off.
800,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"See, it's different to be just lazy and not help us,"
801,00:36:39.10,00:36:39.10, but he's lazy and hurting us.
802,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27," We need to have some type of  harmony while we're out here,"
803,00:36:48.27,00:36:48.27,"when we've got all the other odds against us: the rain,"
804,00:36:51.00,00:36:51.00,"the heat, no food, you know, not much water."
805,00:36:54.47,00:36:54.47, So we need to have
806,00:36:55.93,00:36:55.93," some kind of unity out here,  and with certain people,"
807,00:36:58.13,00:36:58.13, we really don't feel  like we have that.
808,00:36:59.80,00:36:59.80, So we'd rather  just get rid of them.
809,00:37:14.13,00:37:14.13,"PROBST: As you walk in, grab a torch, approach the flame."
810,00:37:20.53,00:37:20.53,This is part of the ritual of the first visit
811,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,"to Tribal Council, because fire represents"
812,00:37:25.03,00:37:25.03,your life in this game.
813,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
814,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,"When your fire's gone, so are you."
815,00:37:34.57,00:37:34.57,For those of you who are still
816,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20,"in the game after tonight's Tribal Council,"
817,00:37:38.87,00:37:38.87,"you'll take these torches back with you to your camp,"
818,00:37:41.67,00:37:41.67,and bring them to all future Tribal Councils.
819,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,So let's get right to it.
820,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,I haven't had a chance to get to know much about you guys.
821,00:37:52.70,00:37:52.70,"Shii Ann, what surprised you the most,"
822,00:37:54.23,00:37:54.23,"in these first nine days, that you didn't expect?"
823,00:37:56.13,00:37:56.13,"Oh, I think the biggest thing was a lack of food, actually."
824,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"And the shelter, I guess."
825,00:38:01.90,00:38:01.90,"I expected more help, so that was probably the biggest shock."
826,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,"Jed, are you expecting food in terms of a reward?"
827,00:38:09.37,00:38:09.37,-Are you counting on that? -We're not expecting anything.
828,00:38:12.30,00:38:12.30,"I mean, we'll live on snails for another week or two,"
829,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,and then drop like flies probably.
830,00:38:18.13,00:38:18.13,"Robb, what's your role, specifically, in this tribe?"
831,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"Um, I think I'm just the happy-go-lucky kid,"
832,00:38:23.67,00:38:23.67,down to do whatever.
833,00:38:25.03,00:38:25.03,I'm just trying to apply myself everywhere
834,00:38:26.87,00:38:26.87,"and help and stay up, stay happy."
835,00:38:28.80,00:38:28.80,"At this point, a lot of us are really drained."
836,00:38:32.27,00:38:32.27,"I mean, you're used to eating so much and having so much energy."
837,00:38:34.87,00:38:34.87,I'm a high-energy kind of guy.
838,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,"I bounce off the walls, you know?"
839,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,"I need a lot of energy,"
840,00:38:39.50,00:38:39.50,"and, man, it's just so hard to come by."
841,00:38:42.60,00:38:42.60,"PROBST: Stephanie, if food continues to be an issue,"
842,00:38:44.93,00:38:44.93,will it divide this tribe?
843,00:38:46.87,00:38:46.87,Will it get to a point where it makes people angry
844,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,just because they're so damn hungry?
845,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,"Oh, it definitely will."
846,00:38:52.57,00:38:52.57,"I mean, it's already changed my mood."
847,00:38:54.10,00:38:54.10,I think it's a little bit harder on people who are in
848,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,really good shape and need the calories and their body's used
849,00:39:00.13,00:39:00.13,"to burning a lot of calories, to go without food."
850,00:39:02.93,00:39:02.93,I think that they tend to sink faster.
851,00:39:04.17,00:39:04.17,"I mean, it looks like that in the tribe to me."
852,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,We're a group here.
853,00:39:08.57,00:39:08.57,It could get bad.
854,00:39:10.33,00:39:10.33,PROBST: So it's your first time at Tribal Council.
855,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43,"It's never fun to vote somebody out, I don't care who you are."
856,00:39:16.03,00:39:16.03,"Jake, how about for you? You picked this tribe."
857,00:39:18.57,00:39:18.57,How do you go about voting your first person out?
858,00:39:20.90,00:39:20.90,"I hate to do it 'cause I love every one of these people,"
859,00:39:23.77,00:39:23.77,"so this one is gonna be a really, really tough one for me."
860,00:39:26.20,00:39:26.20,I think what I'll probably do is
861,00:39:28.13,00:39:28.13,just take a strategic approach and mosey over and vote.
862,00:39:31.87,00:39:31.87,"It's time to vote. Shii Ann, you're first."
863,00:39:59.80,00:39:59.80,If you did the half chores
864,00:40:01.20,00:40:01.20,"you tried to delegate to other people,"
865,00:40:02.80,00:40:02.80,this wouldn't be happening.
866,00:40:27.63,00:40:27.63,"Well, Shii Ann, you never really seemed to click."
867,00:40:29.80,00:40:29.80,"You sort of, uh, got on my nerves."
868,00:40:32.00,00:40:32.00,"You're a sweetheart, but, uh,"
869,00:40:33.43,00:40:33.43,"I'll catch you on the flip side, baby."
870,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,I'll go tally the votes.
871,00:41:06.10,00:41:06.10,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final."
872,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,The person will be asked
873,00:41:09.97,00:41:09.97,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
874,00:41:11.37,00:41:11.37,I'll read the votes.
875,00:41:15.30,00:41:15.30,First vote... Jed.
876,00:41:21.30,00:41:21.30,Jed. That's two votes-- Jed.
877,00:41:26.33,00:41:26.33,Shii Ann.
878,00:41:32.83,00:41:32.83,Shii Ann.
879,00:41:34.20,00:41:34.20,"Two votes-- Jed, two votes-- Shii Ann."
880,00:41:39.93,00:41:39.93,Shii Ann.
881,00:41:41.27,00:41:41.27,"Three votes-- Shii Ann, two votes-- Jed."
882,00:41:49.00,00:41:49.00,Jed. Three votes each.
883,00:41:55.10,00:41:55.10,That's four votes-- Jed.
884,00:42:02.43,00:42:02.43,"Jed. That's five votes, Jed."
885,00:42:04.67,00:42:04.67,You need to bring me your torch.
886,00:42:15.53,00:42:15.53,"Jed, the tribe has spoken."
887,00:42:21.77,00:42:21.77,Time for you to go.
888,00:42:35.77,00:42:35.77,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
889,00:42:37.63,00:42:37.63,Get a good night's sleep.
890,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
891,00:42:53.47,00:42:53.47,"PROBST: Next time on Survivor, the tribes receive new members."
892,00:42:57.17,00:42:57.17,CLAY: There's a dummy over there.
893,00:42:58.50,00:42:58.50,I can't carry the damn thing. I didn't...
894,00:42:59.97,00:42:59.97,-TED: Right. -I swear to God there's a dummy over there.
895,00:43:02.03,00:43:02.03,Big as your ass!
896,00:43:03.67,00:43:03.67,PROBST: And Chuay Gahn  is tearing apart.
897,00:43:05.07,00:43:05.07,The relationship between Ghandia and I is nonexistent.
898,00:43:07.10,00:43:07.10,I only see five people on this island.
899,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,"We ain't gonna be picking each other apart,"
900,00:43:10.67,00:43:10.67,"and if they start that ...,"
901,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00,I'm gonna shut that ... down. I don't care.
902,00:43:18.60,00:43:18.60,"I mean, you don't see anything coming,"
903,00:43:20.37,00:43:20.37," but any time you go  to Tribal Council,"
904,00:43:22.43,00:43:22.43," your head's  on the chopping block,"
905,00:43:24.33,00:43:24.33," whether it be a threat,"
906,00:43:25.80,00:43:25.80, or whether  you rub people the wrong way.
907,00:43:28.00,00:43:28.00, I just hope that everyone else  takes... and step back
908,00:43:32.17,00:43:32.17, and enjoys the beauty of Thailand and the awesomeness
909,00:43:36.53,00:43:36.53,of this experience.
