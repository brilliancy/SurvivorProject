12,00:00:23.47,00:00:23.47,"No, I will throw up."
13,00:00:24.87,00:00:24.87,PROBST: ...Chuay Gahn tried to keep hope alive.
14,00:00:27.03,00:00:27.03,"We're gonna get 'em,that's all I can say."

16,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20, they almost pulled it off.
17,00:00:31.73,00:00:31.73,"Come on, come on, come on."
18,00:00:32.83,00:00:32.83," It was a tight race until the end,"
19,00:00:34.60,00:00:34.60, when Sook Jai claimed another victory...
20,00:00:36.23,00:00:36.23,Yeah!
21,00:00:37.57,00:00:37.57, ...sending Chuay Gahn back to Tribal Council
22,00:00:39.87,00:00:39.87, where Tanya's illness finally caught up with her.
23,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60,The tribe has spoken.
24,00:00:46.43,00:00:46.43, 14 are left.
25,00:00:48.43,00:00:48.43, Who will be the next to go?
26,00:02:08.00,00:02:08.00,CLAY: We've had two immunity challenges;
27,00:02:10.07,00:02:10.07," we've lost that and a war challenge, we've lost that."
28,00:02:11.70,00:02:11.70,"But, yes, our tribe's a family, there's no doubt about it."
29,00:02:14.80,00:02:14.80, And we're happy.
30,00:02:16.10,00:02:16.10, We understood each other's personalities.
31,00:02:18.40,00:02:18.40, We liked each other's personalities.
32,00:02:20.43,00:02:20.43,It was a-a immediate bond.
33,00:02:22.47,00:02:22.47,Everybody...
34,00:02:23.70,00:02:23.70,"The personalities didn't clash,they clicked."
35,00:02:26.83,00:02:26.83,Are those yourreal color eyes there?
36,00:02:28.70,00:02:28.70,"-Mm-hmm. -Oh, okay."
37,00:02:29.67,00:02:29.67,-They just brown.-Cool.
38,00:02:31.10,00:02:31.10, GHANDIA: I was happy that Ted was on my same team.
39,00:02:35.03,00:02:35.03,This is the longest I have everbeen away from my husband.
40,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23," He's my best friend, my homeboy, everything to me."
41,00:02:42.47,00:02:42.47," And Ted brings that home to me, you know?"
42,00:02:46.83,00:02:46.83," It's kind of like my husband's here with me chilling,"
43,00:02:49.80,00:02:49.80, and that really made me feel good.
44,00:02:52.13,00:02:52.13,And he's so good to hug.(laughs)
45,00:02:55.03,00:02:55.03," He's just, he's just cool."
46,00:03:36.53,00:03:36.53,ROBB: This has definitely got to be
47,00:03:38.10,00:03:38.10," the weakest I've ever felt in my life,"
48,00:03:39.57,00:03:39.57, the most fatigued and most drained I've ever felt.
49,00:03:42.80,00:03:42.80,None of us have the energyto do anything.
50,00:03:47.50,00:03:47.50,"My feet, they're just blisteredall to heck, peeling off."
51,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,WOMAN: That is the biggestblister I've ever seen.
52,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93," SHII ANN: We're horrible campers,"
53,00:03:56.30,00:03:56.30, we're terrible outdoorsmen.
54,00:03:59.37,00:03:59.37,We are starving!
55,00:04:01.80,00:04:01.80,We're starving.
56,00:04:03.03,00:04:03.03,"Look at me,I'm, like, Ally McBeal size."
57,00:04:08.30,00:04:08.30,"So far, we haven't beenvery successful"
58,00:04:11.20,00:04:11.20,getting fish in the net.
59,00:04:12.60,00:04:12.60,Whether or not we'redoing something wrong--
60,00:04:14.07,00:04:14.07, I'm not sure-- so I'm not so sure
61,00:04:17.13,00:04:17.13, how rewarding that net is to us.
62,00:04:19.90,00:04:19.90,I'd like a big plate ofcheese and crackers.
63,00:04:22.07,00:04:22.07,(chuckles)
64,00:04:25.40,00:04:25.40, You know what?
65,00:04:26.53,00:04:26.53, We got the net in that challenge
66,00:04:28.00,00:04:28.00, and we're trying to figure out how to make it work.
67,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"Nobody's everlived on the beach,"
68,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,nobody's everbeen around the water.
69,00:04:34.27,00:04:34.27, We don't really know how to work it.
70,00:04:38.67,00:04:38.67,All that work for nothing.
71,00:04:40.10,00:04:40.10,"Wait, we have one."
72,00:04:43.37,00:04:43.37,JED:Nice.
73,00:04:44.40,00:04:44.40,"You know, it's kind of strange"
74,00:04:47.73,00:04:47.73,to be out here and see whereall the fish comes from
75,00:04:50.87,00:04:50.87,that I eat every day at home...
76,00:04:54.90,00:04:54.90,...and not have any ideahow to get it. (chuckles)
77,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87,GHANDIA: I feel a little tired because I didn't get
78,00:05:18.43,00:05:18.43, a lot of sleep last night.
79,00:05:20.30,00:05:20.30,"I just feel kind of depressed,and I feel..."
80,00:05:22.97,00:05:22.97, I feel used.
81,00:05:24.03,00:05:24.03,"BRIAN: Oh, wow,it's the real deal."
82,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,TED:Can I sit next to the diva?
83,00:05:26.97,00:05:26.97,GHANDIA:Sure.
84,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83," Ted and I have gotten close,"
85,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47, and it always seems that I'm sleeping next to him.
86,00:05:33.10,00:05:33.10," And so, last night, he threw his arm over me"
87,00:05:37.70,00:05:37.70," and really pulled me close into him,"
88,00:05:40.37,00:05:40.37," which was kind of okay with me in the beginning, but, um,"
89,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,"he started to, like,really..."
90,00:05:46.40,00:05:46.40,"uh, become very,kind of, sexual."
91,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,"I mean, specifically, he wasgrinding against, against me."
92,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80, And he didn't stop.
93,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37, He kept trying to-- in my opinion-- engage me.
94,00:06:08.07,00:06:08.07, I think Ted's actions
95,00:06:10.67,00:06:10.67,are inappropriatebecause he's married
96,00:06:13.37,00:06:13.37,"and because he just had a baby,like, two weeks ago."
97,00:06:16.67,00:06:16.67,And also because he shouldrespect me as a married woman
98,00:06:20.33,00:06:20.33,"and respect my marriage, also."
99,00:06:26.10,00:06:26.10, You can't just do Ghandia like that.
100,00:06:28.03,00:06:28.03, You can't... I mean...
101,00:06:29.97,00:06:29.97,I'm just not gonna go for it.
102,00:06:33.93,00:06:33.93,"You went up on melast night, tough."
103,00:06:36.27,00:06:36.27,"That's, that's, like,you know what I do?"
104,00:06:38.33,00:06:38.33,"Sometimes when I'm sleeping,you know, it's like"
105,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,"in the middle of the night,I'm not, like, totally clear."
106,00:06:44.37,00:06:44.37,"I'm thinking I'm sleeping withmy wife, so I think what we need"
107,00:06:47.27,00:06:47.27,"to do is I'm not gonna hug you,I'm not gonna hold you"
108,00:06:50.40,00:06:50.40,"because I keep onforgetting that I'm,"
109,00:06:51.57,00:06:51.57,"like, not in the bedwith my wife."
110,00:06:52.93,00:06:52.93,"-Right, right, right.-So I'm, like..."
111,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23,"But it was reallycompromising for me,"
112,00:06:56.87,00:06:56.87,and I just feellike such trash today.
113,00:06:58.83,00:06:58.83,"Don't, because, I mean, whenI do that, I'm not thinking..."
114,00:07:03.37,00:07:03.37,"I'm not, like,in my total mind trying to,"
115,00:07:05.53,00:07:05.53,"like, start something with you,"
116,00:07:06.70,00:07:06.70,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
117,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,...and I apologizeif I've offended you.
118,00:07:09.80,00:07:09.80,GHANDIA:Yeah.
119,00:07:11.27,00:07:11.27,"I mean, it wasn't donemaliciously, it wasn't done"
120,00:07:13.93,00:07:13.93,trying to start somethingor anything like that.
121,00:07:15.00,00:07:15.00,GHANDIA:Mm-hmm.
122,00:07:16.27,00:07:16.27,"Please, from the bottomof my heart, I do apologize."
123,00:07:19.77,00:07:19.77,Why are you crying?What's wrong?
124,00:07:21.40,00:07:21.40,-Because...-What's wrong?
125,00:07:23.10,00:07:23.10,Because that's happenedto me before.
126,00:07:25.87,00:07:25.87,Did it really? Honestly?
127,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,"I was raped before, in college."
128,00:07:29.63,00:07:29.63,-Were you really?-Mm-hmm.
129,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,Get out of here.
130,00:07:32.37,00:07:32.37,"Yeah, I think...I apologize."
131,00:07:34.37,00:07:34.37,And I've had people tell me thatI bring it on myself and stuff.
132,00:07:37.43,00:07:37.43,"-No...-And for a minute this morning,"
133,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,I thought were you gonna try topretend like it didn't happen.
134,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,"No, uh-uh. I was planning ontalking to you later on,"
135,00:07:43.77,00:07:43.77,"but I didn't have, like,an opportunity..."
136,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,-I'm sorry.-...to talk to you about it.
137,00:07:46.90,00:07:46.90,I'm really glad you apologized.That makes me feel a lot better.
138,00:07:49.40,00:07:49.40,"No, seriously, I apologizea million times."
139,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,"-Okay, okay.-Can you forgive me?"
140,00:07:53.03,00:07:53.03,"-Yes, I can.-Okay, all right."
141,00:07:55.70,00:07:55.70,Thank you. Seriously.
142,00:07:57.17,00:07:57.17,"-You're a good person, Ted.-And don't worry."
143,00:07:59.40,00:07:59.40,You don't have to worry aboutthat ever happening again.
144,00:08:01.77,00:08:01.77,-Okay. -You got it?
145,00:08:03.57,00:08:03.57,-All right. -Uh-huh.
146,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,TED: We've always been a family
147,00:08:07.90,00:08:07.90, and we'll continue to be a family.
148,00:08:09.63,00:08:09.63,Even though this incident doesexist within our family--
149,00:08:12.53,00:08:12.53,"quote, unquote ""family""--"
150,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63, I think we can pull together.
151,00:08:15.77,00:08:15.77, I think we all are gonna give 110% in the challenges.
152,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67,"We've got some ass-kickingto do, fellers."
153,00:08:22.07,00:08:22.07,Right.
154,00:08:31.70,00:08:31.70,"PROBST:Welcome, guys."
155,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,"-TED: What's up, Jeff?-GHANDIA: Thank you."
156,00:08:34.77,00:08:34.77,"Well, as you may or may notknow, as recently as the 1960s,"
157,00:08:39.20,00:08:39.20,this island was ruled by pirates
158,00:08:41.07,00:08:41.07,who would rob and stealfrom passing boats.
159,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47,That ties into today's challenge.
160,00:08:45.20,00:08:45.20,Today's challenge is a racealong this bamboo course.
161,00:08:47.70,00:08:47.70,"At the end of the course,two boats-- one for each tribe."
162,00:08:51.00,00:08:51.00,Your goal:rob or steal ten items
163,00:08:55.10,00:08:55.10,"from the other tribe's boat,back to your boat."
164,00:08:57.47,00:08:57.47,First tribe to do so wins.
165,00:08:58.93,00:08:58.93,Here are the rules:
166,00:09:00.03,00:09:00.03,You can only takeone item at a time.
167,00:09:01.97,00:09:01.97,You can only have two memberson a course at any time.
168,00:09:05.23,00:09:05.23,"If you fall off, you losethe item you were carrying"
169,00:09:08.43,00:09:08.43,and you go back to the start.
170,00:09:10.20,00:09:10.20,"In the center of the course,there's an attack zone."
171,00:09:12.20,00:09:12.20,It is clearly markedin black-and-gold cloth.
172,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"If you are in the attack zone,"
173,00:09:17.10,00:09:17.10,you can engage contactwith somebody else who is
174,00:09:20.03,00:09:20.03,also in the attack zone
175,00:09:21.63,00:09:21.63,and try to push them offthe course into the water.
176,00:09:24.23,00:09:24.23,"If you are not in the attackzone when you engage contact,"
177,00:09:26.97,00:09:26.97,you're out of the game.
178,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,And one itemfrom your tribe's boat goes
179,00:09:30.47,00:09:30.47,into the other tribe's boat.
180,00:09:31.67,00:09:31.67,Want to knowwhat you're playing for?
181,00:09:33.77,00:09:33.77,"-Yes, sir.-Yes."
182,00:09:34.77,00:09:34.77,Bring it in!

187,00:09:52.80,00:09:52.80,fix a boat or source every bitof edible food in your camp.
188,00:09:57.87,00:09:57.87,"So when this is done,"
189,00:09:59.03,00:09:59.03,you ought to know howto do this for yourself.
190,00:10:02.00,00:10:02.00,(all agreeing cheerfully)
191,00:10:06.17,00:10:06.17,"Thanks, guys.See you in a little bit."

403,00:18:53.43,00:18:53.43,"He said, ""Is it okayif I hold you?"""
404,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,"HELEN: Well, and we're allin there so close, yeah."
405,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,"I said, ""Yeah, that's fine,because that comforts me."""
406,00:18:59.13,00:18:59.13,"HELEN:Right, and you don't want"
407,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,"to act like you can't handlethe situation, you know?"
408,00:19:02.33,00:19:02.33,-That makes you look bad.-Right.
409,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67, So I just started telling everybody in the tribe
410,00:19:06.60,00:19:06.60, what happened because I felt that everybody in the tribe
411,00:19:09.27,00:19:09.27, should know what he did.
412,00:19:11.83,00:19:11.83,And I was a little hard on him
413,00:19:13.47,00:19:13.47,in retelling the storyto everybody.
414,00:19:16.57,00:19:16.57,"So then when he moved his handon my shoulder,"
415,00:19:18.67,00:19:18.67,"he started biting me onmy shoulder, back here,"
416,00:19:20.83,00:19:20.83,"like sexy biting, you knowhow you bite somebody's..."
417,00:19:23.03,00:19:23.03,-Mm-hmm.-Then it was on from there.
418,00:19:24.87,00:19:24.87,"I was, like, ""This is some ...."
419,00:19:26.70,00:19:26.70,"""Your wife just had a babya ... week ago,"
420,00:19:29.00,00:19:29.00,"""and you bump ... on my ass?"
421,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,"You're happily married."""
422,00:19:31.50,00:19:31.50,But every part of the storythat I told was true.
423,00:19:33.90,00:19:33.90,The only part that I think
424,00:19:35.33,00:19:35.33,that I think I probably left outis that he apologized.
425,00:20:02.63,00:20:02.63,"I wake up at the endof my little nap,"
426,00:20:05.03,00:20:05.03,"after I delegate my duties,"
427,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80, and there's no fishing net to be found.
428,00:20:20.13,00:20:20.13," Me and Robb walked around the beach in search for it,"
429,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03," and basically, whoever last was watching it"
430,00:20:26.47,00:20:26.47,"just didn't delegate off duties,and let it drift away."
431,00:20:30.93,00:20:30.93," ROBB: We figured if we left the net out for a while,"
432,00:20:34.60,00:20:34.60, we might catch some fish
433,00:20:36.30,00:20:36.30,and we might eat and feel good.
434,00:20:38.07,00:20:38.07,"Well, the damn net floated away."
435,00:20:40.57,00:20:40.57,We don't know where the net is.(chuckles)
436,00:20:42.90,00:20:42.90,"PENNY: Tell you what, I surewould feel ten times better"
437,00:20:46.57,00:20:46.57,"-if I could eat something.-I would, too."
438,00:20:49.07,00:20:49.07,-We found some sour berries.-Cool.
439,00:20:52.70,00:20:52.70,"Well, we got some great news."
440,00:20:54.27,00:20:54.27,We've lost the net.
441,00:20:56.60,00:20:56.60,What?
442,00:20:57.87,00:20:57.87,We don't have a cluewhere that net is.
443,00:21:01.80,00:21:01.80,PENNY:That sucks.
444,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73," Those boys took the fishing net out,"
445,00:21:07.63,00:21:07.63,"""We're gonna leave it out inthe ocean for hours and hours."""
446,00:21:10.50,00:21:10.50," Okay, we come back, it's gone."
447,00:21:13.07,00:21:13.07, Why?
448,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,Jed was sleeping.
449,00:21:15.80,00:21:15.80,"So, because Jed was sleepingand unwilling to get up,"
450,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83, the fishing net went bye-bye.
451,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60, It just sailed away.
452,00:22:03.20,00:22:03.20,"HELEN:Yeah, yeah, wrong, yeah."
453,00:22:04.63,00:22:04.63,(Ted laughs)
454,00:22:12.30,00:22:12.30,HELEN: Today is the first day that I really realized
455,00:22:15.63,00:22:15.63, I'm playing Survivor.
456,00:22:16.87,00:22:16.87," I know that sounds silly,"
457,00:22:18.23,00:22:18.23, but I guess I got in the mode out here
458,00:22:20.57,00:22:20.57, where I was surviving off the land; I really did.
459,00:22:26.03,00:22:26.03,"I've been focusing on that, andforgetting that there's a game"
460,00:22:30.73,00:22:30.73,going on here psychologically.
461,00:22:32.70,00:22:32.70,And you could have blown me awaywith the Ted and Ghandia thing.
462,00:22:35.70,00:22:35.70,"-What?-It's kind of serious, yeah."
463,00:22:37.70,00:22:37.70,That's whyshe's been depressed all day.
464,00:22:39.57,00:22:39.57,"-Wow. -I guess it gotpretty bad, so..."
465,00:22:42.63,00:22:42.63,I was completely asleep.
466,00:22:43.93,00:22:43.93,"And she said--you know, me, too."
467,00:22:45.60,00:22:45.60,"-I didn't even know.-I didn't know either, yeah."
468,00:22:47.70,00:22:47.70,"That's highly depressing.Okay, I hear you."
469,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,"I agree. I feel the same waybecause, all of a sudden,"
470,00:22:51.43,00:22:51.43,the person I thoughtI was dealing with
471,00:22:53.13,00:22:53.13,is absolutely not the personI'm dealing with.
472,00:22:54.40,00:22:54.40,Whew.
473,00:22:55.60,00:22:55.60,So...
474,00:22:57.97,00:22:57.97,I just don't think that's cool.
475,00:22:59.83,00:22:59.83,"Um, but I'm just letting youknow what we're gonna do,"
476,00:23:03.77,00:23:03.77,the three of us aregonna take him out next time.
477,00:23:05.53,00:23:05.53,"Okay, okay."
478,00:23:06.90,00:23:06.90,Just letting you knowthat and where we are.
479,00:23:09.00,00:23:09.00, It was quite a surprise when it got back to me that there's
480,00:23:11.93,00:23:11.93,"a problem with Ghandia and Ted,and I'm, like, I'm just,"
481,00:23:15.47,00:23:15.47,the first thing I'm thinking isthat I'm highly disappointed
482,00:23:17.53,00:23:17.53,at some of these actions.
483,00:23:18.90,00:23:18.90, But I don't know what was happening
484,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63, or what wasn't happening.
485,00:23:22.13,00:23:22.13, I wanted to sit back and hear both sides of the story.
486,00:23:24.90,00:23:24.90,"-All right, let me digest this.-Yep."
487,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,"-We'll talk about it tomorrow.-That's fine, that's fine."
488,00:23:28.83,00:23:28.83,"-Thank you, Helen.-Yeah, yeah."
489,00:23:34.03,00:23:34.03,"(sighs)Oh, boy."
490,00:23:35.80,00:23:35.80,I'm coming.
491,00:23:47.53,00:23:47.53,TED:So they're making that soup.
492,00:23:49.13,00:23:49.13,It seems like they just keepadding and adding
493,00:23:51.57,00:23:51.57,and adding and adding.
494,00:23:52.67,00:23:52.67,-Adding more stuff?-Yeah.
495,00:23:54.17,00:23:54.17,"BRIAN: I think one of the most important skills,"
496,00:23:56.47,00:23:56.47,"especially out here,"
497,00:23:57.57,00:23:57.57,"is just listening,taking it all in,"
498,00:24:00.73,00:24:00.73, not saying much.
499,00:24:02.03,00:24:02.03," Even when you're hungry as heck,"
500,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73," hot as heck, the emotions are high,"
501,00:24:05.93,00:24:05.93, you've got to remember to keep that character cool.
502,00:24:09.70,00:24:09.70,"Like Cool Hand Luke,just keep it cool."
503,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,"Nothing happened, right?"
504,00:24:15.70,00:24:15.70,"-A long story.-Yeah, okay."
505,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,Long story.
506,00:24:21.07,00:24:21.07,"I'll just put,I'll just say it this way..."
507,00:24:22.70,00:24:22.70,"I mean, I'm a man,man of my word."
508,00:24:24.90,00:24:24.90,"I mean, a mistake happened,and I rectified it."
509,00:24:28.07,00:24:28.07,-Good. Good.-So...
510,00:24:29.87,00:24:29.87,"-Honest mistake. -Nothinghappened, though, right?"
511,00:24:31.27,00:24:31.27,"-No, nothing at all. -Good."
512,00:24:32.33,00:24:32.33,-Nothing happened at all.-Good.
513,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37,That's all I need to hear.That's all I need to hear.
514,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,"That's the thing that's trippingme out, man-- know what I mean?"
515,00:24:38.47,00:24:38.47,All I need to hear.
516,00:24:40.23,00:24:40.23,That's all I need to hear--nothing happened.
517,00:24:41.30,00:24:41.30,"Ted told methat nothing happened,"
518,00:24:43.80,00:24:43.80,"which he was denyinganything happened,"
519,00:24:47.13,00:24:47.13,which is finebecause nothing did happen.
520,00:24:49.27,00:24:49.27," I interpreted it as they might've been close,"
521,00:24:51.00,00:24:51.00, but there was no contact.
522,00:24:52.50,00:24:52.50,There might've been a hand here or a ankle here
523,00:24:54.77,00:24:54.77,or an earlobe here or something simple as that.
524,00:24:56.90,00:24:56.90,Case closed.
525,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40,What's the sideyou're getting-- just denial
526,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,or that she came on to him?
527,00:25:01.70,00:25:01.70,"Um, no, just more denial."
528,00:25:03.03,00:25:03.03,"Yeah, okay."
529,00:25:04.67,00:25:04.67," And then as Helen was walking by me, I mentioned"
530,00:25:07.23,00:25:07.23, that he denied everything; he said nothing happened.
531,00:25:08.97,00:25:08.97,"I didn't realize that Helenwould run right back to her,"
532,00:25:12.03,00:25:12.03, but I was surprised she went right back to Ghandia
533,00:25:13.97,00:25:13.97," and said, ""Brian said that Ted told him nothing happened."""
534,00:25:15.67,00:25:15.67,(wry laughter)
535,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,He didn't do anything.
536,00:25:17.77,00:25:17.77,So... you got a knifein your hand.
537,00:25:19.63,00:25:19.63,He didn't do anything.
538,00:25:20.90,00:25:20.90, I want to just punch his ass in the eye.
539,00:25:23.70,00:25:23.70,"-He didn't do anything.-Now, if it comes down to..."
540,00:25:26.00,00:25:26.00,"-He didn't do nothing?-No, no, it never happened."
541,00:25:28.20,00:25:28.20,"I guess it was a figmentof your imagination, yeah."
542,00:25:30.43,00:25:30.43,"No, no."
543,00:25:32.40,00:25:32.40,"Ghandia, I wouldn't..."
544,00:25:36.47,00:25:36.47, I heard from Helen that Ted told Brian
545,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80," that nothing happened, and something did happen,"
546,00:25:41.87,00:25:41.87," which really, really set me off."
547,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,(screams)
548,00:25:49.63,00:25:49.63,What was that?
549,00:25:52.17,00:25:52.17,TED: What the ... was that?What?
550,00:25:53.97,00:25:53.97,I-I... It's...just-just crazy lady.
551,00:25:58.20,00:25:58.20,(grunting)
552,00:26:01.43,00:26:01.43,CLAY: That was the most childish act
553,00:26:03.30,00:26:03.30, she's done so far here.
554,00:26:04.87,00:26:04.87,Ghandia gonnago down to the beach and cry
555,00:26:06.50,00:26:06.50,and holler and carry on.
556,00:26:08.07,00:26:08.07,"My two-year-old did thatone time,"
557,00:26:09.90,00:26:09.90,and I whupped its assand put it back in bed.
558,00:26:12.47,00:26:12.47,Bastard!
559,00:26:14.47,00:26:14.47,Piece of ...!
560,00:26:16.73,00:26:16.73,Pig.
561,00:26:18.37,00:26:18.37,Liar!
562,00:26:20.07,00:26:20.07,Cheat!
563,00:26:22.50,00:26:22.50,Butt crack showingevery damn day.
564,00:26:28.97,00:26:28.97,"Rambo, if you couldonly understand"
565,00:26:30.50,00:26:30.50,how much bull...going on around this camp.
566,00:26:32.43,00:26:32.43,You don't understand.
567,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,"Actually, it's good that youdon't understand what's going on"
568,00:26:36.27,00:26:36.27,'cause there'sa lot of bull... going on.
569,00:26:41.50,00:26:41.50,(muttering angrily)
570,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43,You lying piece of...
571,00:26:46.87,00:26:46.87,Sorry.
572,00:26:49.83,00:26:49.83,TED: Ghandia was making an issue
573,00:26:51.50,00:26:51.50," that was very, very small,"
574,00:26:53.30,00:26:53.30,that could have been handled in
575,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,"a very professional,one-on-one manner,"
576,00:26:56.20,00:26:56.20,and has exploded itinto an issue
577,00:26:58.97,00:26:58.97, that goes beyond me and beyond this game.
578,00:27:02.37,00:27:02.37,"Ghandia, I think we need to havea talk in front of everyone."
579,00:27:05.33,00:27:05.33,"Oh, for real, yeah."
580,00:27:06.27,00:27:06.27,"I think so, too."
581,00:27:07.53,00:27:07.53,I think the sooner the better.
582,00:27:08.93,00:27:08.93,"Mm-hmm, I'd likeit to happen right now."
583,00:27:10.80,00:27:10.80,You want to have it now?
584,00:27:12.33,00:27:12.33,"-Mm-hmm.-All right, cool. Okay."
585,00:27:14.20,00:27:14.20,"Yo, Brian, Janny,we're gonna have a talk!"
586,00:27:21.23,00:27:21.23, I told all the tribe members to come in together
587,00:27:24.37,00:27:24.37,"'cause I was tired of all this,you know, rumors going around"
588,00:27:28.47,00:27:28.47,"and people getting confused onwhat the facts are, et cetera."
589,00:27:31.53,00:27:31.53,"The other night, I was waking upwhen the event happened;"
590,00:27:35.77,00:27:35.77,"I was waking up,and from some crazy reason,"
591,00:27:40.50,00:27:40.50,"you know, in that position,I started grinding on Ghandia,"
592,00:27:45.60,00:27:45.60,"maybe two or three times,before realizing"
593,00:27:47.73,00:27:47.73,"""Whoa, sh...this isn't my wife."""
594,00:27:49.07,00:27:49.07,"We talked about it,and I said to Ghandia,"
595,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,"""I am totally apologize andI explained to her exactly"
596,00:27:54.27,00:27:54.27,"what happened, the same wayI'm explaining to you guys."
597,00:27:56.63,00:27:56.63,"And what sparked this meeting,"
598,00:27:58.13,00:27:58.13,"I hear Ghandia saying that,you know, I'm denying it."
599,00:28:00.83,00:28:00.83,I am not denying ...

602,00:28:05.57,00:28:05.57,I am not denying ...!
603,00:28:07.63,00:28:07.63,Helen told methat you denied it to Brian.
604,00:28:09.87,00:28:09.87,"Well, that's what you get forlistening to other people"
605,00:28:11.60,00:28:11.60,when I told you in your face.
606,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27,"Here's my, here's my issueof clarification:"
607,00:28:14.43,00:28:14.43,You said that you woke up
608,00:28:15.70,00:28:15.70,-and you realized that you weremaking a mistake. -Yes.
609,00:28:17.80,00:28:17.80,"So you didn't bite me onthe back of my shoulder,"
610,00:28:19.90,00:28:19.90,-you didn't kiss me onmy shoulder? -No.
611,00:28:21.57,00:28:21.57,You didn't put your hand inmy head and rub my hair?
612,00:28:24.07,00:28:24.07,"Please. Come on.Ghandia, you're blowing it."
613,00:28:25.43,00:28:25.43,"And then when I changedpositions again, you put your"
614,00:28:27.67,00:28:27.67,hand in my hairand you was massaging my head.
615,00:28:29.73,00:28:29.73,"-No. -You was trying...To me, I got the feeling"
616,00:28:31.47,00:28:31.47,that you was tryingto get with me.
617,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,"No, no. First of all,"
618,00:28:35.37,00:28:35.37,-I don't need to get with you.-I know you don't.
619,00:28:37.47,00:28:37.47,"Second of all, I'm not evenattracted to you."
620,00:28:39.10,00:28:39.10,"So, I mean, it's not,it's not even about that."
621,00:28:43.53,00:28:43.53,"I am, I am 150 to 200% happywith the wife that I have,"
622,00:28:50.73,00:28:50.73,that I've chose to spendthe rest of my life with.
623,00:28:53.37,00:28:53.37,"I mean,that's my love right there."
624,00:28:56.23,00:28:56.23,"And I have a daughter,that's my ... love."
625,00:28:59.33,00:28:59.33,Your version of what happened...
626,00:29:03.00,00:29:03.00,"I just, I just want you to behonest, but you don't remember."
627,00:29:06.57,00:29:06.57,You don't remember biting meon my shoulder;
628,00:29:08.77,00:29:08.77,you don't rememberkissing me on my shoulder?
629,00:29:11.40,00:29:11.40,Ghandia. Ghandia...
630,00:29:12.47,00:29:12.47,That just made me uncomfortable.Hold on.
631,00:29:13.90,00:29:13.90,And then the excuse that yougave me that you were in a fog
632,00:29:16.97,00:29:16.97,"and you thoughtthat I was your wife,"
633,00:29:18.67,00:29:18.67,I thought that that wasdisingenuous.
634,00:29:19.87,00:29:19.87,I thoughtthat that was disingenuous.
635,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,That's funny because yourcomment after I apologized was
636,00:29:23.27,00:29:23.27,"to cry and say, ""You know,I really, really needed that"
637,00:29:25.53,00:29:25.53,"and I really appreciateyour honesty."""

640,00:29:31.50,00:29:31.50,"then you would have,you would have addressed it"
641,00:29:33.43,00:29:33.43,"right then and said,"

799,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"See, it's different to bejust lazy and not help us,"
800,00:36:39.10,00:36:39.10, but he's lazy and hurting us.
801,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27," We need to have some type of harmony while we're out here,"
802,00:36:48.27,00:36:48.27,"when we've got all the otherodds against us: the rain,"
803,00:36:51.00,00:36:51.00,"the heat, no food,you know, not much water."
804,00:36:54.47,00:36:54.47, So we need to have
805,00:36:55.93,00:36:55.93," some kind of unity out here, and with certain people,"
806,00:36:58.13,00:36:58.13, we really don't feel like we have that.
807,00:36:59.80,00:36:59.80, So we'd rather just get rid of them.
808,00:37:14.13,00:37:14.13,"PROBST: As you walk in, graba torch, approach the flame."
809,00:37:20.53,00:37:20.53,This is part of the ritualof the first visit
810,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,"to Tribal Council,because fire represents"
811,00:37:25.03,00:37:25.03,your life in this game.
812,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"As long as you have fire,you're still in the game."
813,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,"When your fire's gone,so are you."
814,00:37:34.57,00:37:34.57,For those of you who are still
815,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20,"in the gameafter tonight's Tribal Council,"
816,00:37:38.87,00:37:38.87,"you'll take these torches backwith you to your camp,"
817,00:37:41.67,00:37:41.67,and bring them toall future Tribal Councils.
818,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,So let's get right to it.
819,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,I haven't had a chance to getto know much about you guys.
820,00:37:52.70,00:37:52.70,"Shii Ann,what surprised you the most,"
821,00:37:54.23,00:37:54.23,"in these first nine days,that you didn't expect?"
822,00:37:56.13,00:37:56.13,"Oh, I think the biggest thingwas a lack of food, actually."
823,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,"And the shelter, I guess."
824,00:38:01.90,00:38:01.90,"I expected more help, so thatwas probably the biggest shock."
825,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,"Jed, are you expecting foodin terms of a reward?"
826,00:38:09.37,00:38:09.37,-Are you counting on that?-We're not expecting anything.
827,00:38:12.30,00:38:12.30,"I mean, we'll live on snailsfor another week or two,"
828,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,and then drop like fliesprobably.
829,00:38:18.13,00:38:18.13,"Robb, what's your role,specifically, in this tribe?"
830,00:38:21.43,00:38:21.43,"Um, I think I'm justthe happy-go-lucky kid,"
831,00:38:23.67,00:38:23.67,down to do whatever.
832,00:38:25.03,00:38:25.03,I'm just tryingto apply myself everywhere
833,00:38:26.87,00:38:26.87,"and help and stay up,stay happy."
834,00:38:28.80,00:38:28.80,"At this point,a lot of us are really drained."
835,00:38:32.27,00:38:32.27,"I mean, you're used to eating somuch and having so much energy."
836,00:38:34.87,00:38:34.87,I'm a high-energy kind of guy.
837,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,"I bounce off the walls,you know?"
838,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,"I need a lot of energy,"
839,00:38:39.50,00:38:39.50,"and, man,it's just so hard to come by."
840,00:38:42.60,00:38:42.60,"PROBST: Stephanie, if foodcontinues to be an issue,"
841,00:38:44.93,00:38:44.93,will it divide this tribe?
842,00:38:46.87,00:38:46.87,Will it get to a point whereit makes people angry
843,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,just becausethey're so damn hungry?
844,00:38:51.43,00:38:51.43,"Oh, it definitely will."
845,00:38:52.57,00:38:52.57,"I mean,it's already changed my mood."
846,00:38:54.10,00:38:54.10,I think it's a little bit harderon people who are in
847,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,really good shape and need thecalories and their body's used
848,00:39:00.13,00:39:00.13,"to burning a lot of calories,to go without food."
849,00:39:02.93,00:39:02.93,I think that they tendto sink faster.
850,00:39:04.17,00:39:04.17,"I mean, it looks like thatin the tribe to me."
851,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,We're a group here.
852,00:39:08.57,00:39:08.57,It could get bad.
853,00:39:10.33,00:39:10.33,PROBST: So it's your first timeat Tribal Council.
854,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43,"It's never fun to vote somebodyout, I don't care who you are."
855,00:39:16.03,00:39:16.03,"Jake, how about for you?You picked this tribe."
856,00:39:18.57,00:39:18.57,How do you go about votingyour first person out?
857,00:39:20.90,00:39:20.90,"I hate to do it 'cause I loveevery one of these people,"
858,00:39:23.77,00:39:23.77,"so this one is gonna be areally, really tough one for me."
859,00:39:26.20,00:39:26.20,I think what I'll probably do is
860,00:39:28.13,00:39:28.13,just take a strategic approachand mosey over and vote.
861,00:39:31.87,00:39:31.87,"It's time to vote.Shii Ann, you're first."
862,00:39:59.80,00:39:59.80,If you did the half chores
863,00:40:01.20,00:40:01.20,"you tried to delegateto other people,"
864,00:40:02.80,00:40:02.80,this wouldn't be happening.
865,00:40:27.63,00:40:27.63,"Well, Shii Ann, you neverreally seemed to click."
866,00:40:29.80,00:40:29.80,"You sort of, uh,got on my nerves."
867,00:40:32.00,00:40:32.00,"You're a sweetheart, but, uh,"
868,00:40:33.43,00:40:33.43,"I'll catch youon the flip side, baby."
869,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,I'll go tally the votes.
870,00:41:06.10,00:41:06.10,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final."
871,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,The person will be asked
872,00:41:09.97,00:41:09.97,to leave the Tribal Councilarea immediately.
873,00:41:11.37,00:41:11.37,I'll read the votes.
874,00:41:15.30,00:41:15.30,First vote... Jed.
875,00:41:21.30,00:41:21.30,Jed. That's two votes-- Jed.
876,00:41:26.33,00:41:26.33,Shii Ann.
877,00:41:32.83,00:41:32.83,Shii Ann.
878,00:41:34.20,00:41:34.20,"Two votes-- Jed,two votes-- Shii Ann."
879,00:41:39.93,00:41:39.93,Shii Ann.
880,00:41:41.27,00:41:41.27,"Three votes-- Shii Ann,two votes-- Jed."
881,00:41:49.00,00:41:49.00,Jed. Three votes each.
882,00:41:55.10,00:41:55.10,That's four votes-- Jed.
883,00:42:02.43,00:42:02.43,"Jed. That's five votes, Jed."
884,00:42:04.67,00:42:04.67,You need to bring me your torch.
885,00:42:15.53,00:42:15.53,"Jed, the tribe has spoken."
886,00:42:21.77,00:42:21.77,Time for you to go.
887,00:42:35.77,00:42:35.77,"Grab your torches,head back to camp."
888,00:42:37.63,00:42:37.63,Get a good night's sleep.
889,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
890,00:42:53.47,00:42:53.47,"PROBST: Next time on Survivor,the tribes receive new members."
891,00:42:57.17,00:42:57.17,CLAY:There's a dummy over there.
892,00:42:58.50,00:42:58.50,I can't carry the damn thing.I didn't...
893,00:42:59.97,00:42:59.97,-TED: Right. -I swear to Godthere's a dummy over there.
894,00:43:02.03,00:43:02.03,Big as your ass!
895,00:43:03.67,00:43:03.67,PROBST: And Chuay Gahn is tearing apart.
896,00:43:05.07,00:43:05.07,The relationship between Ghandiaand I is nonexistent.
897,00:43:07.10,00:43:07.10,I only see five peopleon this island.
898,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,"We ain't gonna be pickingeach other apart,"
899,00:43:10.67,00:43:10.67,"and if they start that ...,"
900,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00,I'm gonna shut that ... down.I don't care.
901,00:43:18.60,00:43:18.60,"I mean, you don't seeanything coming,"
902,00:43:20.37,00:43:20.37," but any time you go to Tribal Council,"
903,00:43:22.43,00:43:22.43," your head's on the chopping block,"
904,00:43:24.33,00:43:24.33," whether it be a threat,"
905,00:43:25.80,00:43:25.80, or whether you rub people the wrong way.
906,00:43:28.00,00:43:28.00, I just hope that everyone else takes... and step back
907,00:43:32.17,00:43:32.17, and enjoys the beautyof Thailand and the awesomeness
908,00:43:36.53,00:43:36.53,of this experience.
