448,00:29:38.73,00:29:38.73,MY LOWEST LOW WAS AFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY.
449,00:29:40.47,00:29:40.47,MY DOG DIED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT I HAD ALL MY LIFE AND I DIDN'T

451,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,THAT CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT HURT THAT MUCH.

456,00:30:20.03,00:30:20.03,GOT TO KEEP THE TWO ATHLETES. >> EXACTLY.

458,00:30:26.50,00:30:26.50,DAY ONE BUT I'M HAVING TO MAKE DECISIONS ON DAY 9 THAT I DIDN'T
459,00:30:30.80,00:30:30.80,CONSIDER HAVING TO MAKE UNTIL DAY 20 OR SO.
460,00:30:33.23,00:30:33.23,I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT RUSSELL BELIEVES THAT I'M GOING WITH HIM
461,00:30:36.27,00:30:36.27,TO VOTE OUT DENICE AND KEEP OUR MATCHUP STRONG GOING FORWARD AND
462,00:30:39.93,00:30:39.93,I'D LIKE FOR DENICE TO BELIEVE THAT I'M WITH HER AND THAT WE'RE
463,00:30:42.80,00:30:42.80,GOING TO VOTE OUT RUSS LIKE WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR A WEEK
464,00:30:47.97,00:30:47.97,NOW. >> I'VE GOT MY ALLIANCE THAT'S
465,00:31:11.50,00:31:11.50,WITH MALCOLM AND I HOPE IT'S STRONG.
466,00:31:13.87,00:31:13.87,FOR ME IT'S STRONG. BUT IF RUSSELL HAS THE IMMUNITY
467,00:31:16.70,00:31:16.70,"IDOL IT'S NOT GOOD. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO"
468,00:31:19.67,00:31:19.67,"HAVE TO DRAW ROCKS, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO REVOTE."
469,00:31:22.33,00:31:22.33,I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THERE.
470,00:31:23.57,00:31:23.57,SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET RUSSELL TO THING THAT HE'S THE
471,00:31:26.57,00:31:26.57,SWING. OR TO THINK THAT HE'S COMFORT
472,00:31:27.80,00:31:27.80,SOBL THAT IF HE DOES HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL HE DOESN'T PLAY
473,00:31:31.63,00:31:31.63,IT. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
474,00:31:32.90,00:31:32.90,>> THIS JUST REALLY SUCKS. THIS JUST ISN'T RIGHT.
475,00:31:37.20,00:31:37.20,I DON'T GO INTO ANYTHING EXPECTING LESS THAN THE BEST AND
476,00:31:43.27,00:31:43.27,WHEN I LOSE I'M PISSED. BUT I'LL GET OVER IT.
477,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY.
478,00:31:48.33,00:31:48.33,I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE PEOPLE APPROACH LIFE.
479,00:31:49.77,00:31:49.77,>> IS THAT HOW YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN?
480,00:31:51.97,00:31:51.97,IS THAT HOW YOU'VE ALWAYS HANDLED --
481,00:31:54.07,00:31:54.07,">> YOU KNOW, IT JUST GOT TO -- I GOT JUMPED BY TWO KIDS."
482,00:32:01.47,00:32:01.47,I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT. I WAS WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL
483,00:32:08.37,00:32:08.37,"AND, YOU KNOW, I GOT BEAT UP, BUT BEAT UP AS LITTLE KIDS GET"
484,00:32:12.10,00:32:12.10,BEAT UP. IT WASN'T LIKE A GROWN MAN
485,00:32:14.90,00:32:14.90,BUTT-WHOOPING WHERE YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
486,00:32:19.17,00:32:19.17,AND I CAN REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT I WOULD GO TO
487,00:32:24.33,00:32:24.33,SCHOOL AND I WAS SCARED BECAUSE I WOULD SEE THEM AND THEY WOULD
488,00:32:27.37,00:32:27.37,TEASE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
489,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,SO LONG STORY SHORT I CATCH ONE OF THEM AND WITHOUT EVEN
490,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,THINKING I JUST PUNCHED HIM RIGHT IN HIS FACE AND HE STARTED
491,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,CRYING. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
492,00:32:48.00,00:32:48.00,"THAT. LIKE, NOT THE -- BECAUSE I DON'T"
493,00:32:50.47,00:32:50.47,CONDONE VIOLENCE. BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT JUST
494,00:32:54.10,00:32:54.10,NOT BEING IN FEAR. I THINK JUST FROM THAT DAY IT
495,00:32:58.47,00:32:58.47,WAS JUST LIKE I'M NOT GONNA COWER IN THE FACE OF ANYTHING.
496,00:33:03.97,00:33:03.97,>> I SEE. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
497,00:33:06.13,00:33:06.13,WHY WE'RE IN THIS. >> RIGHT.
498,00:33:07.93,00:33:07.93,>> BUT I DON'T KNOW -- >> THE FIRST THING I'M TRYING TO
499,00:33:10.47,00:33:10.47,FIGURE OUT IF I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT.
500,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,">> WELL, THAT'S WHAT I -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS"
501,00:33:15.77,00:33:15.77,"ARE BUT LOOK, I LIKE MALCOLM BUT INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY LONG TERM,"
502,00:33:20.70,00:33:20.70,"ONCE IT'S THERE, ONCE YOU HERE IN WITH ANOTHER TRIBE PHYSICALLY"
503,00:33:24.33,00:33:24.33,"-- >> IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S ABOUT"
504,00:33:25.73,00:33:25.73,SOCIAL AT THAT POINT. >> EXACTLY.
505,00:33:27.53,00:33:27.53,SOCIALLY HE'S A BIG THREAT. PHYSICALLY THE WAY HE'S GONNA
506,00:33:33.77,00:33:33.77,"PERFORM. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR"
507,00:33:36.10,00:33:36.10,"THOUGHTS ARE. >> WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU"
508,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,"VOTE THAT WAY -- >> I MEAN, THAT'S JUST A"
509,00:33:40.93,00:33:40.93,THOUGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE --
510,00:33:42.03,00:33:42.03,">> SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS UP WITH YOU AND MALCOLM."
511,00:33:44.53,00:33:44.53,I HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED THERE WAS AN ALLIANCE --
512,00:33:47.60,00:33:47.60,>> YOU HAVE TO WEIGH IT OUT EVERY TIME.
513,00:33:49.23,00:33:49.23,">> YEAH. >> AND KIND OF GO, WELL, WHAT'S"
514,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,-- >> YEAH.
515,00:33:53.03,00:33:53.03,"I MEAN, I'M JUST GLAD TO KNOW THAT I AT LEAST HAVE A CHANCE."
516,00:33:56.40,00:33:56.40,I THOUGHT I WAS GONE. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU --
517,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,>> I ASSUME I'M GONE. WE'RE ALL VULNERABLE TONIGHT.
518,00:34:02.27,00:34:02.27,"I ASSUME OKAY, WELL --. >> WELL, DENICE FINALLY HAS KIND"
519,00:34:09.73,00:34:09.73,OF SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT WANTING TO VOTE MALCOLM.
520,00:34:12.83,00:34:12.83,"NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT IF IT -- WHAT IF IT REALLY IS MALCOLM"
521,00:34:18.77,00:34:18.77,WANTING TO VOTE DENICE AND DENICE WANTING TO VOTE MALCOLM
522,00:34:21.83,00:34:21.83,AND I'M IN THIS PIVOTAL POSITION.
523,00:34:26.70,00:34:26.70,"WHAT AM I GONNA DO? >> OH, YOU'RE IS FULL OF MOOD."
524,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,YOU WANT KNOW DIG IT? >> YEAH.

527,00:34:41.07,00:34:41.07,AND I LIKE TO THINK I'M SITTING IN THE CONTROLLING SEAT.
528,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,>> NO CHANCE WE'RE BEING DRY TONIGHT.
529,00:34:49.27,00:34:49.27,">> DENICE WALKS UP TO ME, I SAY ""YEAH, WE'RE GETTING RID OF"

543,00:35:57.73,00:35:57.73,BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A SAFE ASSUMPTION TO THINK IF PLAYER

545,00:36:04.57,00:36:04.57,THREE. >> THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT'S
546,00:36:05.93,00:36:05.93,GOING TO HAPPEN. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ALL SAYING
547,00:36:11.37,00:36:11.37,THE SAME THING TO EVERYONE. YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE GAME IF
548,00:36:13.53,00:36:13.53,YOU'RE NOT SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW

552,00:36:24.87,00:36:24.87,"IT'S A HELPLESS FEELING. >> Jeff: RUSSELL, LET'S TALK"
553,00:36:27.77,00:36:27.77,ABOUT THE CHALLENGE TODAY. SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT WAS OVER.
554,00:36:30.50,00:36:30.50,ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID WAS-- AND I'M PARAPHRASING-- IF I DO
555,00:36:34.43,00:36:34.43,"MY BEST I SHOULD WIN. >> IT'S A MIND-SET, JEFF, AND I"
556,00:36:39.63,00:36:39.63,TALKED TO DENICE A LITTLE BIT TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S A THERAPIST
557,00:36:42.73,00:36:42.73,TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ATTITUDE OF
558,00:36:46.13,00:36:46.13,EXCELLENCE AND YOU KNOW WHERE I CAME UP?
559,00:36:47.57,00:36:47.57,THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME EXPECTING EXCELLENCE FOR MYSELF
560,00:36:51.00,00:36:51.00,EVERY TIME NO MATTER WHAT IT IS THAT I'M DOING.
561,00:36:58.07,00:36:58.07,"SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. IF IT'S A FATAL FLAW, I HAVE TO"
562,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,ACCEPT IT. >> Jeff: WHO PUT MALCOLM IN

574,00:37:38.20,00:37:38.20,"WHEREVER WE END UP. >> Jeff: MALCOLM, WHY KEEP YOU"
575,00:37:42.50,00:37:42.50,TONIGHT? >> WE CAN'T WAIT FOR A TWIST OR
576,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,A MERGE OR ANYTHING. WE HAVE TO WIN SOMETHING AT SOME
577,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,"POINT AND, YOU KNOW, NO OFFENSE TO RUSS BUT I GOT 20 YEARS ON"

581,00:38:02.37,00:38:02.37,I DROPPED THE BALL TODAY BUT I THINK WE'RE THE BIGGEST PHYSICAL
582,00:38:05.97,00:38:05.97,"ASSET WE HAVE. >> Jeff: RUSSELL, WHY SHOULD"
583,00:38:08.43,00:38:08.43,MALCOLM NOT BE HERE TONIGHT? >> BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A YOUNG
584,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,STUD. HE'S A THREAT.
585,00:38:12.20,00:38:12.20,NOT TO SAY THAT I'M NOT. BUT WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE
586,00:38:15.23,00:38:15.23,LIKE MALCOLM. THIS GUY IS INCREDIBLE.
587,00:38:18.30,00:38:18.30,>> Jeff: SO YOUR ARGUMENT TO DENICE TO KEEP YOU IS WHAT?
588,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,">> OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO COMPETE."
589,00:38:23.53,00:38:23.53,I CAN COMPETE. CAN'T COMPETE LIKE MALCOLM.
590,00:38:26.77,00:38:26.77,BUT I'M NO SLOUCH. AND THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE
591,00:38:29.00,00:38:29.00,SOMETHING ON THE SOCIAL END GOING FORWARD.
592,00:38:30.97,00:38:30.97,"AND I CAN DO THAT, TOO, BASED ON WHAT I KNOW EXPERIENTIALLY WHAT"
593,00:38:35.67,00:38:35.67,NEEDS TO HAPPEN. >> Jeff: SO FEW F YOU TWO STAY

595,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,">> THAT'S CORRECT. >> Jeff: MALCOLM, TELL ME WHY"
596,00:38:42.80,00:38:42.80,IT MAKES SENSE TO GET RID OF DENICE TONIGHT.
597,00:38:45.23,00:38:45.23,>> SHE'S A STEP ABOVE ALL OF US SOCIALLY.
598,00:38:48.47,00:38:48.47,I DON'T THINK ANYTHING ANYBODY CAN SAY A SINGLE NEGATIVE THING
599,00:38:50.53,00:38:50.53,ABOUT DENICE AT THIS POINT. >> SHE GETS IN FRONT OF A JURY
