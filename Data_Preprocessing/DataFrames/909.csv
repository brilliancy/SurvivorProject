49,00:03:31.04,00:03:31.04,Tribal Council was a surprise. I would I say that I probably

59,00:03:59.08,00:03:59.08,"Council was tough for me, because even though Sarge gave"

61,00:04:05.42,00:04:05.42,"his word, I felt like I still couldn't trust the guys."
62,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,The guys told me that I was going to be part of the final
63,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83,"four, and they told Julie the same thing."
64,00:04:15.54,00:04:15.54,>> You got to trust the people you're with.
65,00:04:17.04,00:04:17.04,>> I feel like I didn't do anything more to those guys
66,00:04:19.92,00:04:19.92,than what they would've done to me.
67,00:04:21.50,00:04:21.50,I've got a lot of guilt. I didn't like it all.

71,00:04:33.58,00:04:33.58,>> This is how naive Julie and Twila are.
72,00:04:37.38,00:04:37.38,They think they were at the end of our pecking order?

74,00:04:44.96,00:04:44.96,"They're at the end of their pecking order, but the beauty of"

226,00:13:50.12,00:13:50.12,I'm so grateful. Thank you so much.
227,00:13:51.67,00:13:51.67,">> So I won the reward challenge, and I got to take"
228,00:13:54.25,00:13:54.25,"someone with me, so I took Julie because Julie was the one person"
229,00:13:58.79,00:13:58.79,I was a little unclear about as far as where she stood and where
230,00:14:02.29,00:14:02.29,"her head was at. >> Oh, my God."
231,00:14:17.75,00:14:17.75,This is really exciting. Neither of us had ever come
232,00:14:19.96,00:14:19.96,"close to doing anything like this before, and we were trying"
233,00:14:22.29,00:14:22.29,"to take it all in, and we're holding hands, just loving it."
234,00:14:27.12,00:14:27.12,">> Oh, my God! >> The pilot took us"
235,00:14:53.67,00:14:53.67,"through, like, the gorge and down in these big sinkholes."
236,00:14:57.92,00:14:57.92,And-and it was just incredible. When we finally got to our
237,00:15:09.62,00:15:09.62,"destination, which was a dormant volcano..."
238,00:15:14.42,00:15:14.42,we were overlooking a really steep decline.
239,00:15:19.12,00:15:19.12,"Just looking around, and all you can see is untouched, beautiful"
240,00:15:21.25,00:15:21.25,environment. >> We made it.
241,00:15:30.75,00:15:30.75,>> I expected that a volcano would look like you see in
242,00:15:33.88,00:15:33.88,"pictures. But, no, I understand that we're"
243,00:15:37.79,00:15:37.79,"kind of sitting on top of a dormant volcano, and it's just a"
244,00:15:40.71,00:15:40.71,"little surreal, and it's not going to sink in for a while."
245,00:15:45.08,00:15:45.08,>> Got the bubbly. I just want to lick 'em.
246,00:15:49.92,00:15:49.92,"( cork popping ) Oh, wow."
247,00:15:54.12,00:15:54.12,"( both laughing ) Leann and I, we've always liked"
248,00:15:56.83,00:15:56.83,"each other but we've never really talked strategy, so it"
249,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,was really good that we had this opportunity to swap
250,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,strategies and talk a little bit about what was going on in the
251,00:16:05.71,00:16:05.71,game. >> Eliza's comments worry the
252,00:16:09.21,00:16:09.21,...out of me. >> Mm-hmm. And the guys are...
253,00:16:11.25,00:16:11.25,"the guys are so feeding her fire, too."
254,00:16:13.04,00:16:13.04,>> Uh-huh. And she's very gullible to that.
255,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,"She doesn't do anything at all. >> No, she doesn't do anything"
256,00:16:18.25,00:16:18.25,"at all. >> No, she doesn't."
257,00:16:19.54,00:16:19.54,">> If you think about it, I mean, we could lose Eliza over"
258,00:16:21.75,00:16:21.75,"Chris first, you know. >> That's true."
259,00:16:23.42,00:16:23.42,">> Was Scout in your final four? >> Originally. I mean, in my "
260,00:16:26.46,00:16:26.46,"head, I never said it out loud. I think I'm tending to lean"
261,00:16:29.62,00:16:29.62,toward more of the three other people that I'd want to see in
262,00:16:31.83,00:16:31.83,the final four versus that I want to see...
263,00:16:33.17,00:16:33.17,">> I know that's the dilemma. Yeah, like being with, like,"
264,00:16:36.83,00:16:36.83,"Eliza and Scout, and... >> I don't think I'd like that."
265,00:16:38.88,00:16:38.88,>> Everyone would be deserving. So I'd be down.
266,00:16:43.04,00:16:43.04,I'd be faithful. >> Yeah?
267,00:16:45.29,00:16:45.29,">> I would, completely. >> I never promised Scout"
268,00:16:48.46,00:16:48.46,"anything, and all Scout ever asked was to be let known she"
269,00:16:50.75,00:16:50.75,"was going to go, and I don't have a problem with her being"
270,00:16:53.04,00:16:53.04,fifth. ( laughing )
271,00:16:55.46,00:16:55.46,>> Cheers. >> That was fun.
272,00:17:09.42,00:17:09.42,">> That was fun. Little one, look at you."
273,00:17:13.46,00:17:13.46,"She's all pissed off. >> Today's reward challenge, I"
274,00:17:17.00,00:17:17.00,was really annoyed. I felt that there were two women
275,00:17:19.92,00:17:19.92,"in particular, Scout and Twila, who were after me, and Scout"
276,00:17:22.88,00:17:22.88,"kind of said ""Oh, little one, get over it; it's just a game."""
277,00:17:26.17,00:17:26.17,But it was more being taken out in that way-- it is personal.
278,00:17:29.75,00:17:29.75,"It's definitely personal. >> Oh, Eliza, good grief."
279,00:17:33.46,00:17:33.46,"It is not. In this game, you've got to take"
280,00:17:35.54,00:17:35.54,"out the smartest people. >> For some reason, I"
281,00:17:37.75,00:17:37.75,"feel like you're saying that and it's, like, condescending."
282,00:17:39.83,00:17:39.83,Are you being serious? >> Of course I'm being serious.
283,00:17:42.46,00:17:42.46,">> You are smart. >> Yeah, this whole thing"
284,00:17:44.38,00:17:44.38,"is just a game, Scout's right, but gosh, if she wasn't here one"
285,00:17:47.38,00:17:47.38,"more day, I would be a happy camper."
286,00:17:49.42,00:17:49.42,">> How can you say that? I said, ""In deference to your"
287,00:17:52.46,00:17:52.46,"brilliance."" That's exactly the truth."
288,00:17:54.08,00:17:54.08,I've been fed up with Eliza since Day Two.
289,00:17:57.96,00:17:57.96,I'm totally over her. >> The challenge definitely
290,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,showed vulnerability in the women's alliance.
291,00:18:06.92,00:18:06.92,"Questions arose in their minds as to, you know, where do they"
292,00:18:10.33,00:18:10.33,stand. Eliza did realize about the
293,00:18:13.71,00:18:13.71,"pecking order, and, um, she didn't like it."
294,00:18:17.08,00:18:17.08,We see a weakness right there. So it definitely opened up some
295,00:18:21.79,00:18:21.79,doors for us to look into. Eliza is definitely in doubt of
296,00:18:29.62,00:18:29.62,"her position with the girls, and she is vulnerable."
297,00:18:32.83,00:18:32.83,Scout don't like Eliza already. Scout will burn Eliza.
298,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,>> Yeah. There's no place for Eliza in
299,00:18:38.96,00:18:38.96,their final plan. >> Exactly.
300,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,She just doesn't seem like a power player.
301,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,>> She's a token player in Ami and Scout's game.
302,00:18:45.88,00:18:45.88,>> We've got to take Eliza out. We have got to totally sabotage
303,00:18:49.79,00:18:49.79,Eliza's game and send her home. One of the ideas we come up out
304,00:18:53.92,00:18:53.92,there was to try to convince the women that Eliza feels
305,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,"vulnerable, that she doesn't trust her position, that she's"
306,00:18:59.62,00:18:59.62,unhappy with when she was selected in that challenge and
307,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,that possibly she's been talking to us about jumping over with
308,00:19:05.29,00:19:05.29,us. ( laughing )
309,00:19:13.25,00:19:13.25,>> There it is! >> I can see it.
310,00:19:16.54,00:19:16.54,">> Oh, my God! ( whooping )"
311,00:19:21.17,00:19:21.17,Put your window down. Wave your hand all the way out
312,00:19:23.83,00:19:23.83,there. >> There they are. They're...
313,00:19:29.83,00:19:29.83,they are waving. >> Our girls are back.
314,00:19:45.79,00:19:45.79,"( whooping ) >> Oh, they got a bundle"
315,00:19:49.29,00:19:49.29,in their hands. >> They're gone. They're away.
316,00:19:53.75,00:19:53.75,( whooping ) Are you wasted? Get over here.
317,00:19:55.92,00:19:55.92,">> Yes, we're wasted, but we smuggled only you ladies back"
318,00:19:58.21,00:19:58.21,"something. >> Oh, God."
319,00:19:59.46,00:19:59.46,">> Shh, shh. Okay, we got chicken wings for"
320,00:20:01.50,00:20:01.50,"you, we got bones for them. >> Two... we have two chicken "
321,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,wings for each of you. >> Quick...
322,00:20:06.12,00:20:06.12,>> Give them her... give them their chicken wings.
323,00:20:09.75,00:20:09.75,>> Julie lifts up her pants and she had tied a bag of leftover
324,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,"chicken wings to her leg. >> Oh, my God."
325,00:20:16.25,00:20:16.25,( Scout gasps ) >> Here you go. Run.
326,00:20:19.83,00:20:19.83,Not a word. Not a word. Run. ( talking quietly )
327,00:20:26.12,00:20:26.12,">> Oh, my God. >> I feel like such a, like, a"
328,00:20:29.17,00:20:29.17,bad kid. >> I know.
329,00:20:30.50,00:20:30.50,">> Man. >> Don't waste a drop, dude."
330,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,Eat the fat. Eat everything but the bone.
331,00:20:37.29,00:20:37.29,"Isn't it yummy, though? >> Did you all stuff yourself?"
332,00:20:39.88,00:20:39.88,You got plenty? >> Yeah.
333,00:20:40.83,00:20:40.83,>> Yeah. >> Eat the cartilage.
334,00:20:43.83,00:20:43.83,>> You eat that. >> All right.
335,00:20:45.54,00:20:45.54,">> I mean, that's more than just a..."
336,00:20:47.62,00:20:47.62,">> I know. >> Ready, go."
337,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,>> The girls are back. You are drunk.
338,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,>> Did you put the bones in? >> The bones?
339,00:21:03.71,00:21:03.71,">> Put the bones in. >> Oh, is there any meat on the"
340,00:21:06.75,00:21:06.75,bones? >> We just didn't know
341,00:21:08.58,00:21:08.58,"what would be offensive and insulting or whatever, so..."
342,00:21:10.67,00:21:10.67,>> And all we could do is bring back the bones.
343,00:21:13.92,00:21:13.92,>> No kidding? You brought back chicken bones?
344,00:21:15.96,00:21:15.96,">> Oh, my God. I seen my bone. I see my bone."
345,00:21:20.12,00:21:20.12,Look at that meat on that bone. >> Uh-huh.
346,00:21:23.50,00:21:23.50,I was real pleased that they brought back some bones of hot
347,00:21:26.04,00:21:26.04,wings. The average American would be
348,00:21:28.33,00:21:28.33,"like ""Oh, my God, that is the lowest form of insult I could"
349,00:21:31.88,00:21:31.88,"ever imagine,"" but to the Alinta tribe, it was like Christmas."
350,00:21:37.08,00:21:37.08,">> So, listen, you guys rock... >> Yeah?"
351,00:21:38.67,00:21:38.67,>> ...for bringing back these bones.
352,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,">> Yeah, thanks for bringing this back, you guys."
353,00:21:42.38,00:21:42.38,">> We were, like, ""Are they gonna get insulted?"""
354,00:21:44.50,00:21:44.50,"But I was, like, ""I would want to eat the bones."""
355,00:21:46.38,00:21:46.38,>> It is not insulting at all. >> Look how insulted we look.
356,00:21:49.08,00:21:49.08,>> The guys-- when they came back-- were really excited
357,00:21:51.12,00:21:51.12,"about getting the bones, and we had to pretend to be excited"
358,00:21:53.21,00:21:53.21,"about the bones, too, because they didn't know that we had"
359,00:21:55.08,00:21:55.08,just had chicken wings. >> Wow.
360,00:21:56.42,00:21:56.42,">> We... Yeah, we tried to... >> Wow."
361,00:21:58.04,00:21:58.04,>> We tried to leave meat. >> Julie and I were just
362,00:22:00.08,00:22:00.08,"kind of sitting there watching everybody, going, ""Oh, man, if"
363,00:22:02.29,00:22:02.29,"they only knew."" >> Thanks, girls."
364,00:22:06.21,00:22:06.21,Life is good at Alinta. ( birds singing)
365,00:22:20.17,00:22:20.17,>> This is fun... Oh.
366,00:22:22.42,00:22:22.42,( snorting) No way.
367,00:22:24.21,00:22:24.21,( laughs) I went to get tree mail alone
368,00:22:27.38,00:22:27.38,"this morning, and then there sitting tied up right behind"
369,00:22:30.79,00:22:30.79,"tree mail was this big pig. Come on, buddy."
370,00:22:33.12,00:22:33.12,I've never really dealt with animals.
371,00:22:35.21,00:22:35.21,"I've never, you know, been around a farm."
372,00:22:37.58,00:22:37.58,"Why don't you want to go? No, come on."
373,00:22:40.54,00:22:40.54,Piggy. Come on.
374,00:22:42.12,00:22:42.12,Why are you being so difficult? Shh. It's okay.
375,00:22:46.00,00:22:46.00,"( snorting) Piggy, come on."
376,00:22:48.67,00:22:48.67,"I don't want to drag you the whole way, come on."
377,00:22:51.71,00:22:51.71,"( squealing) Chris, Chris!"
378,00:22:53.12,00:22:53.12,"Tree mail. Help, come here."
379,00:22:58.62,00:22:58.62,"( Chris muttering) >> No. Oh, my God."
380,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,Of course I had to go to this tree mail.
381,00:23:07.21,00:23:07.21,"Okay, piggy. Help is coming. ( squealing)"
382,00:23:11.71,00:23:11.71,>> There's a pig. ( indistinct chatter )
383,00:23:16.25,00:23:16.25,">> Oh, yeah. Nice and steady..."
384,00:23:21.08,00:23:21.08,">> Thank you. >> Here, pig, pig, pig..."
385,00:23:23.04,00:23:23.04,">> No, no, no, no, no, no, no... You can't eat him. Don't..."
386,00:23:25.46,00:23:25.46,You both have machetes. Good start.
387,00:23:26.79,00:23:26.79,">> Come on, Sarge. >> Wait, listen, listen, listen."
388,00:23:29.42,00:23:29.42,>> I'm ready to eat. >> We want bacon. We don't care 
389,00:23:31.42,00:23:31.42,"about this damn pig. >> Here, pig, pig, pig, pig,"
390,00:23:34.96,00:23:34.96,pig. I wanted to eat the pig so bad
391,00:23:36.12,00:23:36.12,that I could taste his fatback cooked up with my
392,00:23:38.12,00:23:38.12,"cabbages. >> ""Health, wealth, a status"
393,00:23:40.29,00:23:40.29,"symbol. With this pig, you could have it"
394,00:23:42.33,00:23:42.33,"made. Feed him, clean him, take good"
395,00:23:44.29,00:23:44.29,"care, give him shelter in the shade."
396,00:23:47.12,00:23:47.12,"Soon enough some of you will learn the value of this pig, so"
397,00:23:50.42,00:23:50.42,"keep him happy, healthy and in your camp."
398,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,"Soon he could pay off big."" >> Yeah. I still..."
399,00:23:55.21,00:23:55.21,>> He still looks awful damn good to me.
400,00:23:56.96,00:23:56.96,>> He still looks... ( Twila laughs)
401,00:23:58.12,00:23:58.12,">> He still looks like ribs. I read this note. It says, ""No, "
402,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,"can't kill the pig."" It was a big letdown."
403,00:24:02.54,00:24:02.54,It was about as big a letdown as when I found out Estrogen City
404,00:24:06.08,00:24:06.08,was moving into Lopevi. You don't know how much I want
405,00:24:08.96,00:24:08.96,to eat you. If I can't link myself to the
406,00:24:11.17,00:24:11.17,"Estrogen City, at least I can link myself to a pig."
407,00:24:13.88,00:24:13.88,( pig snorts ) You know?
408,00:24:15.29,00:24:15.29,"Have some friend up in here. >> PROBST: Wow, Sarge, you look"
409,00:24:30.21,00:24:30.21,angry. >> Just thinking.
410,00:24:34.00,00:24:34.00,">> PROBST: Good or bad, immunity is back up for grabs."
411,00:24:36.38,00:24:36.38,"I'll get that from you. All right, for today's"
412,00:24:41.79,00:24:41.79,"challenge, you're gonna start with a puzzle."
413,00:24:43.71,00:24:43.71,You'll have a minute to complete the puzzle.
414,00:24:45.71,00:24:45.71,"Each round, I will give you a different configuration of that"
415,00:24:48.54,00:24:48.54,"puzzle. Get it right, you stay in."
416,00:24:51.50,00:24:51.50,"Wrong, you're out. Last person left standing wins"
417,00:24:55.12,00:24:55.12,"immunity, is safe from the vote tonight."
418,00:24:57.38,00:24:57.38,"Everybody else, fair game. Simple enough?"
419,00:25:00.21,00:25:00.21,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: Completely random,"
420,00:25:01.88,00:25:01.88,take a spot behind one of the puzzles.
421,00:25:03.75,00:25:03.75,We'll get started. Here we go.
422,00:25:06.25,00:25:06.25,"The first puzzle configuration. Yeah, wait."
423,00:25:14.46,00:25:14.46,"Right now you're just looking, making notes."
424,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,Begin. 30 seconds.
425,00:25:49.33,00:25:49.33,"15 seconds. Five, four..."
426,00:25:57.17,00:25:57.17,"three, two... one."
427,00:26:00.67,00:26:00.67,Everybody take your hands off your puzzle board.
428,00:26:03.79,00:26:03.79,"All right, everybody turn your puzzle board around to face me."
429,00:26:12.96,00:26:12.96,Eliza got it right. >> Is this blue?
430,00:26:18.33,00:26:18.33,>> PROBST: Chad's wrong. Ami's right.
431,00:26:25.21,00:26:25.21,Julie got it right. Leann got it right.
432,00:26:33.25,00:26:33.25,Scout got it right. Twila got it right.
433,00:26:39.88,00:26:39.88,"Chris, you have it wrong. ( Chris sighs )"
434,00:26:42.88,00:26:42.88,">> Wrong. >> PROBST: Sarge, you have it"
435,00:26:46.88,00:26:46.88,"wrong. Chad, Chris, Sarge-- all the"
436,00:26:51.21,00:26:51.21,"men, all wrong. Take a seat on the bench."
437,00:26:55.17,00:26:55.17,"First round down, three men gone."
438,00:26:58.29,00:26:58.29,Next puzzle configuration. Begin.
439,00:27:20.71,00:27:20.71,30 seconds. Ten seconds.
440,00:27:33.42,00:27:33.42,"Five, four... three, two..."
441,00:27:37.42,00:27:37.42,one. Take your hands off your
442,00:27:40.00,00:27:40.00,"puzzles. All right, turn 'em around."
443,00:27:46.00,00:27:46.00,Eliza got it right. Still in.
444,00:27:50.42,00:27:50.42,Ami got it right. She's still good.
445,00:27:54.38,00:27:54.38,Julie's right. Leann's right.
446,00:28:03.62,00:28:03.62,Scout's wrong. And Twila's wrong.
447,00:28:11.50,00:28:11.50,"Round two is over. Scout and Twila, take a seat on"
448,00:28:14.08,00:28:14.08,the log. We are down to four.
449,00:28:16.92,00:28:16.92,Next puzzle configuration. This time you'll get less time
450,00:28:21.25,00:28:21.25,to look at it and less time to put it together.
451,00:28:25.58,00:28:25.58,Begin. 30 seconds.
452,00:28:45.79,00:28:45.79,"Last ten seconds. Five, four..."
453,00:28:50.04,00:28:50.04,"three, two, one. Take your hands off your puzzle."
454,00:28:54.25,00:28:54.25,"Spin 'em around. Eliza, you have a worried look"
455,00:28:57.17,00:28:57.17,on your face. >> I might have messed something
456,00:28:59.71,00:28:59.71,up. >> PROBST: What do you think you
457,00:29:02.29,00:29:02.29,"might have messed up? Nope, but you messed something"
458,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,else up. >> I did?
459,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,>> PROBST: You're wrong. Ami got it right.
460,00:29:13.92,00:29:13.92,Julie got it right. Leann got it right.
461,00:29:21.08,00:29:21.08,Eliza the only casualty in that round.
462,00:29:23.33,00:29:23.33,We are down to three. Next puzzle configuration.
463,00:29:27.46,00:29:27.46,We're going to shorten the time even more.
464,00:29:29.04,00:29:29.04,>> Oh. >> PROBST: Go.
465,00:29:47.29,00:29:47.29,20 seconds. Ami caught something right at
466,00:29:56.38,00:29:56.38,"the end. Five, four."
467,00:29:58.71,00:29:58.71,"Leann hustling. Three, two, one."
468,00:30:02.54,00:30:02.54,You're done. Spin them around.
469,00:30:07.04,00:30:07.04,Ami what did you change at the last?
470,00:30:08.75,00:30:08.75,">> I had to turn these to blue. I mean, to green."
471,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,>> PROBST: Ami's right. Julie's wrong.
472,00:30:17.08,00:30:17.08,Leann. >> Yeah.
473,00:30:19.21,00:30:19.21,">> PROBST: You're wrong. >> Oh, come on now."
474,00:30:21.58,00:30:21.58,>> PROBST: Ami wins immunity. ( applause and cheering )
475,00:30:24.58,00:30:24.58,Face your tribe. Only one person safe tonight at
476,00:30:27.46,00:30:27.46,"the vote. That is this woman, Ami."
477,00:30:31.21,00:30:31.21,Everybody else is fair game. You have the afternoon to figure
478,00:30:33.83,00:30:33.83,out who's going home tonight. I will see you all at Tribal
479,00:30:35.83,00:30:35.83,Council. Head on back to camp.
480,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,>> I'm pissed off at myself that I didn't expect the center spike
481,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,"to be different colors, and I look at it, and I'm like oh, my"
482,00:30:57.62,00:30:57.62,God. >> I won the challenge today.
483,00:30:59.96,00:30:59.96,"I don't know if that was the smartest idea in the world, just"
484,00:31:03.54,00:31:03.54,"because I'm already kind of seen as a stronger woman, and that's"
485,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,"a threat to some of the other women, but I can't let myself"
486,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83,play bad. >> I'm glad you won.
487,00:31:12.29,00:31:12.29,How about if I win all the rewards and you win all the
488,00:31:14.29,00:31:14.29,"immunity? >> Okay. Oh, I like that!"
489,00:31:16.29,00:31:16.29,">> Works for me! >> Tonight at Tribal Council,"
490,00:31:18.29,00:31:18.29,I'm voting for Sarge. He's a strong physical threat
491,00:31:22.75,00:31:22.75,and out of other guys it's probably best that we send him
492,00:31:26.04,00:31:26.04,first since he doesn't have immunity now.
493,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,">> Basically, I get the feeling that I'm going home"
494,00:31:34.96,00:31:34.96,"because of a physical threat, but I actually think that there"
495,00:31:39.00,00:31:39.00,can be a twist and Eliza could go home because Scout is that
496,00:31:42.92,00:31:42.92,much against her. >> Okay. We're ready.
497,00:31:45.62,00:31:45.62,">> Grab the box, the crate. >> What box do we need?"
498,00:31:47.92,00:31:47.92,">> The crate right up there. >> Of course, little Liza, I"
499,00:31:58.50,00:31:58.50,hate hanging out with that energy.
500,00:32:00.71,00:32:00.71,>> It's true. We always imagined that she was
501,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,"the first because she's already been on the chopping block, and"
502,00:32:06.04,00:32:06.04,"that's common knowledge, so... >> Well, just me personally."
503,00:32:10.58,00:32:10.58,"She drives me nutty. If she says that word ""like"" a"
504,00:32:14.29,00:32:14.29,"thousand times, just drives me nutty."
505,00:32:18.00,00:32:18.00,>> Scout is out plotting with them right now.
506,00:32:20.46,00:32:20.46,"I don't know if they will take her word again, but after she..."
507,00:32:23.62,00:32:23.62,( Ami chuckles ) >> I... it's so funny.
508,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,>> She talks so much ( bleep ) about you and about me and it's
509,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,just like... >> I think it's funny.
510,00:32:31.62,00:32:31.62,>> Now she's trying to get back in with Chris and just like...
511,00:32:34.12,00:32:34.12,>> She's good at it. She's good at it though.
512,00:32:39.17,00:32:39.17,>> I feel like I've been paranoid since day one.
513,00:32:42.38,00:32:42.38,"I mean, it's a game where people are going to be voting each"
514,00:32:45.88,00:32:45.88,other off so you have to be paranoid.
515,00:32:48.00,00:32:48.00,She's the only person here who I really have a strong dislike
516,00:32:52.25,00:32:52.25,for. Scout has already gone after me
517,00:32:54.54,00:32:54.54,"two, three times now. I think she would write my name"
518,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,"down in a heartbeat, and, you know, I would write her name"
519,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,down in a heartbeat. >> Eliza and myself have
520,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,"an ongoing tension, you know. She knows that she annoys me,"
521,00:33:16.25,00:33:16.25,and I'm sure I annoy her so that's going on.
522,00:33:19.58,00:33:19.58,And I think something else might be going on.
523,00:33:23.46,00:33:23.46,Jules and Leann have gotten to be kind of tight since they went
524,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,"on their little trip together, and I think Leann might have"
525,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,bumped me down in the hierarchy a little bit after that trip.
526,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,"So there may be some changes. Hell, I might get sent home"
527,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,tonight. >> I didn't screw you all on
528,00:33:43.71,00:33:43.71,purpose. That's the way I felt: that you
529,00:33:45.58,00:33:45.58,were getting ready to ... me over after Julie...
530,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,"Would you not have got the damn same feeling, Sarge?"
531,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,>> No. >> Why?
532,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,>> 'Cause you gave me your word. >> I did give...
533,00:33:53.75,00:33:53.75,">> You gave me your word, Twila. And I would have walked off this"
534,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,game today before I crossed your word.
535,00:33:59.96,00:33:59.96,I'll be honest with you. This is how it was supposed to
536,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,"go. It was supposed to go Rory, then"
537,00:34:04.71,00:34:04.71,"you, then Chad, Chris and me. >> But I'd have been a fourth"
538,00:34:07.29,00:34:07.29,"person. >> You were four so solid, like"
539,00:34:09.08,00:34:09.08,my whole life depended on it. >> Blame it on Julie that
540,00:34:11.67,00:34:11.67,the reason things got changed. Today was the first day that I
541,00:34:15.00,00:34:15.00,"actually got to talk to Sarge alone, and I thought the guys"
542,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,"were manipulating me, but Sarge looked at me and told me"
543,00:34:22.88,00:34:22.88,"honestly, and I believe him wholeheartedly, that Julie put"
544,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,doubt in my mind against the guys.
545,00:34:29.88,00:34:29.88,"She's going to bump me and Scout out, I can feel it already."
546,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,">> I know, that's what I'm saying, that's why me and Chris"
547,00:34:33.88,00:34:33.88,"are sick to our stomach, and we kept saying, ""Where did Twila"
548,00:34:38.08,00:34:38.08,"think she was? She had a guaranteed four slot."""
549,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,>> But I didn't know that. How did I know that anymore with
550,00:34:43.71,00:34:43.71,you? >> Why didn't you come to me
551,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,again after Julie talked to you and looked me in the eye and
552,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,"I would have swore to you? >> I should have, Sarge."
553,00:34:50.79,00:34:50.79,I screwed up when I didn't vote with the guys.
554,00:34:53.54,00:34:53.54,I felt uneasy about making the decision I made because I've had
555,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,more respect out of these three guys I felt than I ever got over
556,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,"at the girls' camp, there's no doubt about it, and I do feel"
557,00:35:05.17,00:35:05.17,like I let 'em down. >> Yeah.
558,00:35:06.96,00:35:06.96,>> Remember that time we were talking about in the boat?
559,00:35:09.21,00:35:09.21,"I just thought of it. If you three, us three, Twila"
560,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,"and if we got Eliza, 'cause she's next on the chopping"
561,00:35:13.21,00:35:13.21,"block, it would be 5-4. If she, has any brains at"
562,00:35:15.21,00:35:15.21,"all, I just thought of this. >> Chad said if I went on"
563,00:35:21.46,00:35:21.46,"their side and they could get Eliza to go with us, we could"
564,00:35:25.42,00:35:25.42,knock the women out. I'm willing to play however I
565,00:35:28.58,00:35:28.58,"have to play this game to get ahead, I'm gonna play it."
566,00:35:40.62,00:35:40.62,">> In this game your strategy changes just immediately, and"
567,00:35:43.21,00:35:43.21,"since the ladies got here, I learned real quick from the"
568,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,"first night that you got to watch what you say, that they"
569,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"are a tight-knit group and if you want to survive, you're"
570,00:35:52.46,00:35:52.46,going to have to please them. I've been in alliance with Sarge
571,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,and Chad since day one. We don't have the numbers.
572,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,"Unless we can pull something off with Twila and Eliza, it's over."
573,00:36:20.33,00:36:20.33,">> PROBST: Well, over the last couple of days a lot of emotion"
574,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,has been wearing on the sleeve. I want to talk about a little
575,00:36:25.96,00:36:25.96,"of it starting with yesterday's reward challenge, and you,"
576,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"Eliza, you were the first woman knocked out and when you sat"
577,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"down on the bench with the guys, you weren't hiding anything."
578,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83,>> I was pissed. What can I say?
579,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,"I mean, I would have been pissed if I was the second to last"
580,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,"person knocked out, too. I mean, it's just my nature."
581,00:36:43.17,00:36:43.17,>> PROBST: The reason I bring it up is dating back as far as I
582,00:36:46.54,00:36:46.54,"think the very first Tribal Council, it seems like you've"
583,00:36:49.71,00:36:49.71,been struggling with this group of women.
584,00:36:52.04,00:36:52.04,Are you still fighting a little bit?
585,00:36:53.92,00:36:53.92,>> I'm the only woman tonight who came with a bag
586,00:36:56.92,00:36:56.92,packed because even when I think that it's absolutely
587,00:36:59.71,00:36:59.71,"certain I don't want to have, you know, Rory syndrome and"
588,00:37:02.75,00:37:02.75,"start to feel confident and then get booted, so, yes."
589,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,This is a game. It's always on my mind.
590,00:37:07.75,00:37:07.75,"I always feel vulnerable. >> PROBST: Sarge, are you"
591,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,starting to sense some division within the women?
592,00:37:12.96,00:37:12.96,">> Oh, I mean, there is division, I see it every day."
593,00:37:16.04,00:37:16.04,"There's a four-way and there's a two-way here, and if they would"
594,00:37:19.58,00:37:19.58,"jump away from that group and take that chance, maybe they"
595,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,have a better shot at something later.
596,00:37:24.79,00:37:24.79,People make decisions on a spur- of-the-moment thing.
597,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,"You know, you tell them the wrong thing."
598,00:37:29.58,00:37:29.58,"That's what happened with Twila. I told her no matter what,"
599,00:37:32.75,00:37:32.75,you're the number four in my pack.
600,00:37:35.29,00:37:35.29,"Well, Jules went to her and said she was promised number four and"
601,00:37:39.58,00:37:39.58,Twila automatically freaked out and thought that Jules had got
602,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,"her a number four slot and Twila was out to lunch, so she jumped"
603,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,back with the women. >> I felt that I was
604,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,"being played all the way around. >> Yeah, she felt she was being,"
605,00:37:50.46,00:37:50.46,"she let Julie, uh, snake her. >> I was stuck in the"
606,00:37:54.25,00:37:54.25,"middle, and I think the women know I felt more at ease over"
607,00:37:57.25,00:37:57.25,here with the men than I ever did with the women.
608,00:37:59.62,00:37:59.62,"I'm not going to lie about that, and it's tough."
609,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,">> PROBST: Leann, is there a certain amount of respect for"
610,00:38:06.08,00:38:06.08,"Twila that she's being honest in saying, ""Yeah, I did make"
611,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,friends on both side; I'm not going to lie about it;
612,00:38:11.62,00:38:11.62,"and I'm conflicted about it""? >> Oh, absolutely, and I"
613,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,think Twila kind of had the worst position of anybody in
614,00:38:17.96,00:38:17.96,"that the guys kind of came down on her more than her and Julie,"
615,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,"for the way she voted last Tribal Council, and I don't know"
616,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,why Julie kind of got off scot-free out of that one.
617,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,>> I was kind of curious about that myself.
618,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,>> How did I get off scot-free? All my skulls were put out by
619,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,the men. They're gonna write my name down
620,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50,"tonight instead of Twila's. >> PROBST: Chris, is duplicity"
621,00:38:38.12,00:38:38.12,part of this game? >> Yeah. It's part of this game.
622,00:38:41.67,00:38:41.67,"When you're put in a situation like Julie and Twila was, they"
623,00:38:45.25,00:38:45.25,"played the game, and they played both sides."
624,00:38:47.62,00:38:47.62,Would I have done the same? Probably. This game is all about
625,00:38:49.62,00:38:49.62,"numbers, and they got the numbers, you know, but the game "
626,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,ain't over yet. We're still playing.
627,00:38:55.33,00:38:55.33,">> PROBST: Okay. With tonight's vote, the game"
628,00:38:57.71,00:38:57.71,changes a little bit because tonight you're voting out the
629,00:39:00.83,00:39:00.83,first member of your jury. So it is not only who you vote
630,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,"out, but how you vote people out from here on out that's going to"
631,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,dictate somebody's future because seven of you will end up
632,00:39:10.04,00:39:10.04,"over here, two of you will end up in the final Tribal"
633,00:39:12.79,00:39:12.79,"Council, and those seven people are going to determine which one"
634,00:39:16.04,00:39:16.04,"gets the million bucks. Having said that, Ami, you have"
635,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,the immunity necklace. Holding on to it?
636,00:39:21.46,00:39:21.46,>> I am. >> PROBST: Ami is the only
637,00:39:22.96,00:39:22.96,person you cannot vote for. Everybody else is definitely
638,00:39:24.71,00:39:24.71,"fair game, it is time to vote. Eliza, you're up."
639,00:40:12.42,00:40:12.42,>> I'm going to burn every one of them.
640,00:40:14.79,00:40:14.79,"Just let them open the door. This is for you, not against"
641,00:40:17.33,00:40:17.33,you. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
642,00:40:25.00,00:40:25.00,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
643,00:40:38.58,00:40:38.58,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
644,00:40:40.62,00:40:40.62,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
645,00:40:42.67,00:40:42.67,I'll read the votes. Sarge.
646,00:40:50.04,00:40:50.04,Eliza. Julie.
647,00:40:55.58,00:40:55.58,"One vote Eliza, one vote Sarge. One vote Julie."
648,00:41:02.21,00:41:02.21,Sarge. Two votes Sarge.
649,00:41:08.00,00:41:08.00,Sarge. That's three votes Sarge.
650,00:41:13.25,00:41:13.25,Sarge. Four votes Sarge.
651,00:41:18.79,00:41:18.79,Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu: Sarge.
652,00:41:22.54,00:41:22.54,That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
653,00:41:25.67,00:41:25.67,">> Good luck. >> PROBST: Sarge, the tribe has"
654,00:41:34.62,00:41:34.62,spoken. It's time for you to go.
655,00:41:48.88,00:41:48.88,"Talk all you want about who has the numbers advantage, but there"
656,00:41:53.29,00:41:53.29,is one wildcard you can always count on: individual immunity;
657,00:41:57.71,00:41:57.71,and that can get any one of you all the way to the end.
658,00:42:00.25,00:42:00.25,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
659,00:42:01.83,00:42:01.83,Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our
660,00:42:15.92,00:42:15.92,next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on

662,00:42:23.21,00:42:23.21,>> It's going to be a miracle if we can keep our fire.
663,00:42:26.17,00:42:26.17,I've never been in a worse situation than this.
664,00:42:29.21,00:42:29.21,>> PROBST: And then Scout makes her move.
665,00:42:31.79,00:42:31.79,">> The guys will vote with us, then the game changes."
666,00:42:34.46,00:42:34.46,>> Right now I'm not real trusting in the ladies.

668,00:42:39.08,00:42:39.08, NETWORK TELEVISION >> I just want to say
669,00:42:44.08,00:42:44.08,I enjoyed myself. I had an experience of a
670,00:42:46.38,00:42:46.38,"lifetime to all the people in the game, changed my character"
671,00:42:49.79,00:42:49.79,and put another chip in my foundation of what I believe in.
672,00:42:53.21,00:42:53.21,"I never had to jeopardize my word, my character and my name,"
673,00:42:57.67,00:42:57.67,"so good luck to you all, and I would not want to be here there"
674,00:42:59.83,00:42:59.83,while y'all tear each other's head off.
