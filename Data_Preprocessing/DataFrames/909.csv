230,00:14:17.75,00:14:17.75,This is really exciting.Neither of us had ever come

237,00:15:14.42,00:15:14.42,we were overlooking a reallysteep decline.

248,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,was really good that we hadthis opportunity to swap
249,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,strategies and talk a little bitabout what was going on in the
250,00:16:05.71,00:16:05.71,game.>> Eliza's comments worry the

252,00:16:11.25,00:16:11.25,"the guys are so feeding herfire, too."
253,00:16:13.04,00:16:13.04,>> Uh-huh.And she's very gullible to that.
254,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,"She doesn't do anything at all.>> No, she doesn't do anything"

260,00:16:29.62,00:16:29.62,toward more of the three otherpeople that I'd want to see in
261,00:16:31.83,00:16:31.83,the final four versus that Iwant to see...
262,00:16:33.17,00:16:33.17,">> I know that's the dilemma.Yeah, like being with, like,"
263,00:16:36.83,00:16:36.83,"Eliza and Scout, and...>> I don't think I'd like that."
264,00:16:38.88,00:16:38.88,>> Everyone would be deserving.So I'd be down.
265,00:16:43.04,00:16:43.04,I'd be faithful.>> Yeah?
266,00:16:45.29,00:16:45.29,">> I would, completely.>> I never promised Scout"
267,00:16:48.46,00:16:48.46,"anything, and all Scout everasked was to be let known she"
268,00:16:50.75,00:16:50.75,"was going to go, and I don'thave a problem with her being"

272,00:17:13.46,00:17:13.46,"She's all pissed off.>> Today's reward challenge, I"
273,00:17:17.00,00:17:17.00,was really annoyed.I felt that there were two women
274,00:17:19.92,00:17:19.92,"in particular, Scout and Twila,who were after me, and Scout"
275,00:17:22.88,00:17:22.88,"kind of said ""Oh, little one,get over it; it's just a game."""
276,00:17:26.17,00:17:26.17,But it was more being taken outin that way-- it is personal.
277,00:17:29.75,00:17:29.75,"It's definitely personal.>> Oh, Eliza, good grief."
278,00:17:33.46,00:17:33.46,"It is not.In this game, you've got to take"
279,00:17:35.54,00:17:35.54,"out the smartest people.>> For some reason, I"
280,00:17:37.75,00:17:37.75,"feel like you're saying that andit's, like, condescending."
281,00:17:39.83,00:17:39.83,Are you being serious?>> Of course I'm being serious.
282,00:17:42.46,00:17:42.46,">> You are smart.>> Yeah, this whole thing"
283,00:17:44.38,00:17:44.38,"is just a game, Scout's right,but gosh, if she wasn't here one"
284,00:17:47.38,00:17:47.38,"more day, I would be a happycamper."
285,00:17:49.42,00:17:49.42,">> How can you say that?I said, ""In deference to your"
286,00:17:52.46,00:17:52.46,"brilliance.""That's exactly the truth."
287,00:17:54.08,00:17:54.08,I've been fed up with Elizasince Day Two.
288,00:17:57.96,00:17:57.96,I'm totally over her.>> The challenge definitely
289,00:18:04.08,00:18:04.08,showed vulnerability in thewomen's alliance.
290,00:18:06.92,00:18:06.92,"Questions arose in their mindsas to, you know, where do they"
291,00:18:10.33,00:18:10.33,stand.Eliza did realize about the
292,00:18:13.71,00:18:13.71,"pecking order, and, um, shedidn't like it."
293,00:18:17.08,00:18:17.08,We see a weakness right there.So it definitely opened up some
294,00:18:21.79,00:18:21.79,doors for us to look into.Eliza is definitely in doubt of
295,00:18:29.62,00:18:29.62,"her position with the girls, andshe is vulnerable."
296,00:18:32.83,00:18:32.83,Scout don't like Eliza already.Scout will burn Eliza.
297,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,>> Yeah.There's no place for Eliza in
298,00:18:38.96,00:18:38.96,their final plan.>> Exactly.
299,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,She just doesn't seem like apower player.
300,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,>> She's a token player inAmi and Scout's game.
301,00:18:45.88,00:18:45.88,>> We've got to take Eliza out.We have got to totally sabotage
302,00:18:49.79,00:18:49.79,Eliza's game and send her home.One of the ideas we come up out
303,00:18:53.92,00:18:53.92,there was to try to convince thewomen that Eliza feels
304,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,"vulnerable, that she doesn'ttrust her position, that she's"
305,00:18:59.62,00:18:59.62,unhappy with when she wasselected in that challenge and
306,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,that possibly she's been talkingto us about jumping over with
307,00:19:05.29,00:19:05.29,us.( laughing )

484,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,"a threat to some of the otherwomen, but I can't let myself"

489,00:31:18.29,00:31:18.29,I'm voting for Sarge.He's a strong physical threat
490,00:31:22.75,00:31:22.75,and out of other guys it'sprobably best that we send him
491,00:31:26.04,00:31:26.04,first since he doesn't haveimmunity now.
492,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,">> Basically, I get thefeeling that I'm going home"
493,00:31:34.96,00:31:34.96,"because of a physical threat,but I actually think that there"
494,00:31:39.00,00:31:39.00,can be a twist and Eliza couldgo home because Scout is that
495,00:31:42.92,00:31:42.92,much against her.>> Okay. We're ready.
496,00:31:45.62,00:31:45.62,">> Grab the box, the crate.>> What box do we need?"

507,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,>> She talks so much ( bleep )about you and about me and it's
508,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,just like...>> I think it's funny.

510,00:32:34.12,00:32:34.12,>> She's good at it.She's good at it though.

513,00:32:45.88,00:32:45.88,other off so you have to beparanoid.
514,00:32:48.00,00:32:48.00,She's the only person here who Ireally have a strong dislike
515,00:32:52.25,00:32:52.25,for.Scout has already gone after me
516,00:32:54.54,00:32:54.54,"two, three times now.I think she would write my name"
517,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,"down in a heartbeat, and, youknow, I would write her name"
518,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,down in a heartbeat.>> Eliza and myself have
519,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,"an ongoing tension, you know.She knows that she annoys me,"
520,00:33:16.25,00:33:16.25,and I'm sure I annoy her sothat's going on.
521,00:33:19.58,00:33:19.58,And I think something else mightbe going on.
522,00:33:23.46,00:33:23.46,Jules and Leann have gotten tobe kind of tight since they went
523,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,"on their little trip together,and I think Leann might have"
524,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,bumped me down in the hierarchya little bit after that trip.
525,00:33:34.08,00:33:34.08,"So there may be some changes.Hell, I might get sent home"
526,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,tonight.>> I didn't screw you all on
527,00:33:43.71,00:33:43.71,purpose.That's the way I felt: that you
528,00:33:45.58,00:33:45.58,were getting ready to ... meover after Julie...
529,00:33:48.17,00:33:48.17,"Would you not have got thedamn same feeling, Sarge?"
530,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,>> No.>> Why?
531,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,>> 'Cause you gave me your word.>> I did give...
532,00:33:53.75,00:33:53.75,">> You gave me your word, Twila.And I would have walked off this"
533,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,game today before I crossed yourword.
534,00:33:59.96,00:33:59.96,I'll be honest with you.This is how it was supposed to
535,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,"go.It was supposed to go Rory, then"
536,00:34:04.71,00:34:04.71,"you, then Chad, Chris and me.>> But I'd have been a fourth"
537,00:34:07.29,00:34:07.29,"person.>> You were four so solid, like"
538,00:34:09.08,00:34:09.08,my whole life depended on it.>> Blame it on Julie that
539,00:34:11.67,00:34:11.67,the reason things got changed.Today was the first day that I
540,00:34:15.00,00:34:15.00,"actually got to talk to Sargealone, and I thought the guys"
541,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,"were manipulating me, but Sargelooked at me and told me"
542,00:34:22.88,00:34:22.88,"honestly, and I believe himwholeheartedly, that Julie put"
543,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,doubt in my mind against theguys.
544,00:34:29.88,00:34:29.88,"She's going to bump me and Scoutout, I can feel it already."
545,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,">> I know, that's what I'msaying, that's why me and Chris"
546,00:34:33.88,00:34:33.88,"are sick to our stomach, and wekept saying, ""Where did Twila"
547,00:34:38.08,00:34:38.08,"think she was?She had a guaranteed four slot."""
548,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,>> But I didn't know that.How did I know that anymore with
549,00:34:43.71,00:34:43.71,you?>> Why didn't you come to me
550,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,again after Julie talked toyou and looked me in the eye and
551,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,"I would have swore to you?>> I should have, Sarge."
552,00:34:50.79,00:34:50.79,I screwed up when I didn't votewith the guys.
553,00:34:53.54,00:34:53.54,I felt uneasy about making thedecision I made because I've had
554,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,more respect out of these threeguys I felt than I ever got over
555,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,"at the girls' camp, there's nodoubt about it, and I do feel"
556,00:35:05.17,00:35:05.17,like I let 'em down.>> Yeah.
557,00:35:06.96,00:35:06.96,>> Remember that time wewere talking about in the boat?
558,00:35:09.21,00:35:09.21,"I just thought of it.If you three, us three, Twila"
559,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,"and if we got Eliza, 'causeshe's next on the chopping"

569,00:35:52.46,00:35:52.46,going to have to please them.I've been in alliance with Sarge
570,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,and Chad since day one.We don't have the numbers.
571,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,"Unless we can pull something offwith Twila and Eliza, it's over."
572,00:36:20.33,00:36:20.33,">> PROBST: Well, over the lastcouple of days a lot of emotion"
573,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,has been wearing on the sleeve.I want to talk about a little
574,00:36:25.96,00:36:25.96,"of it starting with yesterday'sreward challenge, and you,"
575,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"Eliza, you were the first womanknocked out and when you sat"
576,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"down on the bench with the guys,you weren't hiding anything."
577,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83,>> I was pissed.What can I say?
578,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,"I mean, I would have been pissedif I was the second to last"
579,00:36:40.21,00:36:40.21,"person knocked out, too.I mean, it's just my nature."
580,00:36:43.17,00:36:43.17,>> PROBST: The reason I bring itup is dating back as far as I
581,00:36:46.54,00:36:46.54,"think the very first TribalCouncil, it seems like you've"
582,00:36:49.71,00:36:49.71,been struggling with this groupof women.
583,00:36:52.04,00:36:52.04,Are you still fighting a littlebit?
584,00:36:53.92,00:36:53.92,>> I'm the only womantonight who came with a bag
585,00:36:56.92,00:36:56.92,packed because even when Ithink that it's absolutely
586,00:36:59.71,00:36:59.71,"certain I don't want to have,you know, Rory syndrome and"
587,00:37:02.75,00:37:02.75,"start to feel confident and thenget booted, so, yes."
588,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,This is a game.It's always on my mind.
589,00:37:07.75,00:37:07.75,"I always feel vulnerable.>> PROBST: Sarge, are you"
590,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,starting to sense some divisionwithin the women?
591,00:37:12.96,00:37:12.96,">> Oh, I mean, there isdivision, I see it every day."
592,00:37:16.04,00:37:16.04,"There's a four-way and there's atwo-way here, and if they would"
593,00:37:19.58,00:37:19.58,"jump away from that group andtake that chance, maybe they"
594,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,have a better shot at somethinglater.
595,00:37:24.79,00:37:24.79,People make decisions on a spur-of-the-moment thing.
596,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,"You know, you tell them thewrong thing."
597,00:37:29.58,00:37:29.58,"That's what happened with Twila.I told her no matter what,"
598,00:37:32.75,00:37:32.75,you're the number four in mypack.
599,00:37:35.29,00:37:35.29,"Well, Jules went to her and saidshe was promised number four and"
600,00:37:39.58,00:37:39.58,Twila automatically freaked outand thought that Jules had got
601,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,"her a number four slot and Twilawas out to lunch, so she jumped"
602,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,back with the women.>> I felt that I was
603,00:37:48.21,00:37:48.21,"being played all the way around.>> Yeah, she felt she was being,"
604,00:37:50.46,00:37:50.46,"she let Julie, uh, snake her.>> I was stuck in the"
605,00:37:54.25,00:37:54.25,"middle, and I think the womenknow I felt more at ease over"
606,00:37:57.25,00:37:57.25,here with the men than I everdid with the women.
607,00:37:59.62,00:37:59.62,"I'm not going to lie about that,and it's tough."
608,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,">> PROBST: Leann, is there acertain amount of respect for"
609,00:38:06.08,00:38:06.08,"Twila that she's being honest insaying, ""Yeah, I did make"
610,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,friends on both side;I'm not going to lie about it;
611,00:38:11.62,00:38:11.62,"and I'm conflicted about it""?>> Oh, absolutely, and I"
612,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,think Twila kind of had theworst position of anybody in
613,00:38:17.96,00:38:17.96,"that the guys kind of came downon her more than her and Julie,"
614,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,"for the way she voted lastTribal Council, and I don't know"
615,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,why Julie kind of got offscot-free out of that one.
616,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,>> I was kind of curiousabout that myself.
617,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,>> How did I get off scot-free?All my skulls were put out by
618,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,the men.They're gonna write my name down
619,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50,"tonight instead of Twila's.>> PROBST: Chris, is duplicity"
620,00:38:38.12,00:38:38.12,part of this game?>> Yeah. It's part of this game.
621,00:38:41.67,00:38:41.67,"When you're put in a situationlike Julie and Twila was, they"
622,00:38:45.25,00:38:45.25,"played the game, and they playedboth sides."
623,00:38:47.62,00:38:47.62,Would I have done the same?Probably. This game is all about
624,00:38:49.62,00:38:49.62,"numbers, and they got thenumbers, you know, but the game "
625,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,ain't over yet.We're still playing.

632,00:39:12.79,00:39:12.79,"Council, and those seven peopleare going to determine which one"
633,00:39:16.04,00:39:16.04,"gets the million bucks.Having said that, Ami, you have"
634,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,the immunity necklace.Holding on to it?
