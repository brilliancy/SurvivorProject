42,00:01:53.04,00:01:53.04,>> She didn't go underwater.>> PROBST: But there was a
43,00:01:55.08,00:01:55.08,divide in the opinions.>> I was thinking Ashlee.

48,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,>> It's hot in hereall of a sudden.
49,00:02:11.62,00:02:11.62,">> All jokes aside, there's noalliances being built here."

57,00:03:58.79,00:03:58.79,"tough today, I thought.>> That's the way this game"
58,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,"goes, you know?>> Yeah."
59,00:04:03.25,00:04:03.25,I think Tribal Council tonighttold a lot 'cause Kim and Jeff
60,00:04:06.21,00:04:06.21,both got votes.If we would have went
61,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,"with our original votes,Ashlee'd still be here,"
62,00:04:10.08,00:04:10.08,"and Kim'd be gone.I think Kim's aware,"
63,00:04:12.79,00:04:12.79,"and I think Jeff's aware, too.>> Are you serious?"
64,00:04:17.42,00:04:17.42,">> Mm-hmm.I know, Jeff totally pinpointed"
65,00:04:20.04,00:04:20.04,"you guys, like, were a coupleor something."
66,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,>> I know. It was obnoxious.>> And you know what?
67,00:04:24.46,00:04:24.46,"You can't be like, ""No, we'rejust like really good friends."""
68,00:04:26.96,00:04:26.96,"You have to be like, ""Oh, yeah,we're kind of attracted"
69,00:04:29.12,00:04:29.12,"to one another.""You know, like..."
70,00:04:31.04,00:04:31.04,>> It pisses me off.It really does piss me off.
71,00:04:33.46,00:04:33.46,">> At Tribal,Jeff was pretty brutal."
72,00:04:35.50,00:04:35.50,He asked me about Kim and I.I just basically said that
73,00:04:38.25,00:04:38.25,we're keeping each other warm.We...
74,00:04:41.25,00:04:41.25,It really does helpto have someone next to you.
75,00:04:54.04,00:04:54.04,>> I think the thingbetween me and Jeff
76,00:04:56.83,00:04:56.83,has just been exaggeratedby everybody talking about it.
77,00:05:00.25,00:05:00.25,I don't want people conjuringthis image up in their head
78,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,"that's not accurate,and thinking that"
79,00:05:04.71,00:05:04.71,"there's two personal lives,it's like strategy or what."
80,00:05:07.17,00:05:07.17,I don't want that image.>> Jeff Probst asked Kim and
81,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,"Jeff if there's anything goingon, you know?"
82,00:05:20.58,00:05:20.58,"And they said, ""No,we're just buddies, cuddling."""
83,00:05:22.71,00:05:22.71,Mm-mm-- everybody seeswhat they're doing.
84,00:05:24.96,00:05:24.96,"Right now they're cuddling.Next week, they're going to be"
85,00:05:28.08,00:05:28.08,"making out.You know, sucking face"
86,00:05:30.42,00:05:30.42,"and stuff.She's a woman,"
87,00:05:33.21,00:05:33.21,and all she has to her advantageis her sexuality.
88,00:05:35.79,00:05:35.79,Kim's got to go.I'm keeping an eye on them.
89,00:05:39.17,00:05:39.17,"I got ears like a bat,I'm telling you."
90,00:05:45.96,00:05:45.96,( distant thunder rolling )( seagulls crying )
91,00:06:00.50,00:06:00.50,">> Oh, man, look at that outthere."
92,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,>> It's the showerwe were all looking for.
93,00:06:05.58,00:06:05.58,It's been raininga couple times a day.
94,00:06:08.88,00:06:08.88,"We have kind of a lame shelter,and we're kind of limited"
95,00:06:12.04,00:06:12.04,"to supplies here.We're getting wet at night,"
96,00:06:14.00,00:06:14.00,and we need a better shelter.>> I've been digging and
97,00:06:16.92,00:06:16.92,digging-- a heavy day it's been.I was not gonna let it go.
98,00:06:19.42,00:06:19.42,I'm trying to focus onthat damn shelter.
99,00:06:21.38,00:06:21.38,"It's been three days,and it's still not finished."
100,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,"This is just going to takea little thinking, girls."
101,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50,( grunting )Nine strong has its
102,00:06:28.04,00:06:28.04,"advantages and disadvantages,'cause, obviously,"
103,00:06:30.08,00:06:30.08,"we're all still together,we're still strong."
104,00:06:32.21,00:06:32.21,"Yeah, I think people aregrating their nerves even worse"
105,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,"'cause, you know, you can'tever get rid of anybody."
106,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,You know you're stuck with them.>> I need to ask you something.
107,00:06:39.25,00:06:39.25,"If you can find more bamboo,do you think you can?"
108,00:06:41.33,00:06:41.33,>> It's hard to find.>> Even getting something
109,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,on the other side if possibleto block out the...
110,00:06:45.83,00:06:45.83,Someone needs to get upin that tree and do the top.
111,00:06:47.88,00:06:47.88,Don't you think?>> Yeah.
112,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,>> Won't be me.>> Katie is a very...
113,00:06:53.04,00:06:53.04,"I don't know what the word is;it's not outspoken,"
114,00:06:56.08,00:06:56.08,"it's tart, you know?Just that she has something"
115,00:06:58.42,00:06:58.42,to say all the timeabout everything.
116,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,>> What are you going to dowith those?
117,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,>> I'm just filling gaps here.>> I'm thinking we could use
118,00:07:08.21,00:07:08.21,"those for the bed.>> There's more, a lot more."
119,00:07:11.04,00:07:11.04,And it's especially truewith me.
120,00:07:13.33,00:07:13.33,"For seven days, I've been notsaying anything,"
121,00:07:15.75,00:07:15.75,and I've just had it.And I just decided to confront
122,00:07:18.46,00:07:18.46,her; I want it to stop.And I've just had enough!
123,00:07:22.25,00:07:22.25,"Now, I don't want to make waves.>> And you're making waves."
124,00:07:24.08,00:07:24.08,">> No, this is between you andme."
125,00:07:26.83,00:07:26.83,I'm not making a scenein front of the tribe.
126,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,And I don't want to bringanyone else into this.
127,00:07:30.58,00:07:30.58,">> Why are you all freaked out?>> Because everything I say,"
128,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,you have some snotty remark.I throw a freakin' stick
129,00:07:36.04,00:07:36.04,"in the fire, you're like,""Oh, they say don't throw"
130,00:07:38.04,00:07:38.04,"sticks in the fire.""Don't tell me what to do, Katie!"
131,00:07:39.92,00:07:39.92,Don't tell me what to doanymore.
132,00:07:42.29,00:07:42.29,I'm done hearing it.>> I was just sitting
133,00:07:44.75,00:07:44.75,on the edge of the boat.She just comes up to me
134,00:07:46.88,00:07:46.88,"and she's, like,""Do you have a problem with me?"""
135,00:07:49.25,00:07:49.25,"And I'm like, ""What?""And I started laughing"
136,00:07:51.50,00:07:51.50,"'cause she was so irate.>> You said the guys said,"
137,00:07:53.88,00:07:53.88,"""Don't throw sticks in thefire,"" like, everything I say,"
138,00:07:56.08,00:07:56.08,you're on me.Get off me!
139,00:08:00.08,00:08:00.08,>> She wouldn't even give methe time to respond
140,00:08:02.38,00:08:02.38,to any of her accusations.She wanted to come up to me
141,00:08:05.25,00:08:05.25,and just tell me off.And then she went off
142,00:08:07.25,00:08:07.25,and she left.She turns and frowns.
143,00:08:09.00,00:08:09.00,"Like, I couldn't stop laughing.She's crazy."
144,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,She's completely lost it.I don't need you yelling at me.
145,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,I think there's a betterway of doing this.
146,00:08:15.46,00:08:15.46,>> Okay.>> If there wasn't any
147,00:08:17.17,00:08:17.17,"animosity, there is now,'cause I don't like"
148,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,people yelling at me.>> The repercussions of my
149,00:08:21.58,00:08:21.58,"confronting Katie will be thatshe will not talk to me,"
150,00:08:24.17,00:08:24.17,"and that's just fine with me.Unfortunately,"
151,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,there might be some tensionaround the tribe as well.
152,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,You will always run the riskif you're too confrontational
153,00:08:32.58,00:08:32.58,"of being the one who's votedoff, but I haven't heard"
154,00:08:34.96,00:08:34.96,my name come up.It could change now
155,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,as a result of what I did.>> PROBST: I'll now bring in
156,00:08:52.42,00:08:52.42,the new Ulong tribe.Ashlee voted out
157,00:08:56.46,00:08:56.46,"at the last Tribal Council.All right, you guys ready"
158,00:09:00.79,00:09:00.79,for today's challenge?>> We're ready.

161,00:09:06.79,00:09:06.79,"Here's how it works.On my go,"
162,00:09:09.00,00:09:09.00,a life ring will be releasedfrom the bottom of the ocean.
163,00:09:11.67,00:09:11.67,"Your goal?Swim out, retrieve the ring,"
164,00:09:15.21,00:09:15.21,bring it back to yourtribe-colored pontoon.
165,00:09:17.33,00:09:17.33,First tribe member to geta hand on the pontoon
166,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,while having a handon the life ring
167,00:09:22.00,00:09:22.00,scores a point for their tribe.Here's the catch.
168,00:09:24.92,00:09:24.92,Aside from punchingor otherwise intentionally
169,00:09:27.08,00:09:27.08,"trying to hurt someone,you can pretty much do whatever"
170,00:09:30.83,00:09:30.83,you want to get that ringand keep it and get back.
171,00:09:34.00,00:09:34.00,"Push, pull, dunk, splash,keeping in mind that ultimately"
172,00:09:39.21,00:09:39.21,"this is a social game.And to win it,"
173,00:09:42.21,00:09:42.21,you will need the votesof the people you are living
174,00:09:44.92,00:09:44.92,"with and competing against.How you play it,"
175,00:09:47.25,00:09:47.25,"ultimately up to you.First round, one man"
176,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,"from each tribe will square off.Second round, one woman"
177,00:09:53.21,00:09:53.21,"from each tribe will square off.After that,"
178,00:09:55.92,00:09:55.92,we'll switch things up.First tribe to score three
179,00:09:58.25,00:09:58.25,wins reward.Want to know what
180,00:10:00.92,00:10:00.92,you're playing for?>> Yes.

184,00:10:10.25,00:10:10.25,We've got three buffsworking as skirts.
185,00:10:12.21,00:10:12.21,"So, hopefully,the reward will change"
186,00:10:14.25,00:10:14.25,"the way you guys look.But if you are resourceful,"
187,00:10:17.12,00:10:17.12,there are a lot of itemsyou can use around camp.
188,00:10:19.67,00:10:19.67,"Worth playing for?>> Hell, yeah."

566,00:32:33.62,00:32:33.62,"I'm not, I mean...>> You don't even think,"
567,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,"like, a couple of days...?>> To tell you the truth..."
568,00:32:37.25,00:32:37.25,There's no way.I can barely put
569,00:32:39.50,00:32:39.50,any weight on it right nowwithout clenching my teeth.
570,00:32:42.12,00:32:42.12,"Like, every time I step,I feel like a tear is going"
571,00:32:45.42,00:32:45.42,"to come out of my eye.If I stay in here, you guys"
572,00:32:48.42,00:32:48.42,aren't gonna get to the end.>> I don't want you
573,00:32:51.46,00:32:51.46,"to leave here, though,and in two days your ankle"
574,00:32:53.62,00:32:53.62,will be feeling fineand us be like...
575,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,>> So we're going to vote outsomeone else instead?
576,00:32:58.75,00:32:58.75,There's no reason tovote off anybody else.
577,00:33:02.38,00:33:02.38,"All right?>> Yeah, we want you to stay."
578,00:33:07.12,00:33:07.12,">> Soon as we got back to thebeach, old Jeff said, ""Guys,"
579,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,"you need to vote me off.""Oh, we were sad, you know."
580,00:33:14.46,00:33:14.46,"We didn't want to vote him out.He's strong, you know, he does a"
581,00:33:17.88,00:33:17.88,"lot around here, you know?And the person we were planning"
582,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,"on voting out, which is Kim,does hardly anything."
583,00:33:24.83,00:33:24.83,">> We vote Jeff off, it's goingto be like two people gone"
584,00:33:27.46,00:33:27.46,"anyway, 'cause she ain't didnone of the challenges."
585,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,She ain't do nothingaround the camp.
586,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,">> Yeah, she's down there layingup, ain't doing nothing"
587,00:33:33.50,00:33:33.50,down there.>> She's so happy 'cause she
588,00:33:35.17,00:33:35.17,thinks she's okay tonight.>> That boy's tough.
589,00:33:37.88,00:33:37.88,">> Yeah, I'd rather,nurture him and feed him."
590,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,I feel very stronglythat Jeff should stay.
591,00:33:42.42,00:33:42.42,We should get ridof Kim for sure tonight.
592,00:33:46.04,00:33:46.04,"Jeff's weakness is our strength.Even when he's down, he's ten"
593,00:33:49.12,00:33:49.12,times stronger than Kim.I'm definitely going to go talk
594,00:33:51.96,00:33:51.96,with other people in the tribeand see what they think.
595,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,">> Bobby Jon, I don'tknow about you,"
596,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,"but just to let you know,I'm voting for Jeff."
597,00:34:01.58,00:34:01.58,">> You are?>> Oh, yeah."
598,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,I planed on voting for Jeffas soon as he hurt his ankle.
599,00:34:06.88,00:34:06.88,>> Okay.>> And I'm not swaying from it.
600,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,">> Okay, cool.Well, I ain't voting for him,"
601,00:34:13.08,00:34:13.08,"'cause I'm voting for Kim,because I'll be danged"
602,00:34:15.75,00:34:15.75,if I'm going to feed somebodywhen they don't do nothing.
603,00:34:18.46,00:34:18.46,>> Yeah.Some of the other tribe members
604,00:34:21.12,00:34:21.12,"want to vote off Kim,and I can see that"
605,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,"because she didn't reallydo much, but I'm kind of hoping"
606,00:34:25.46,00:34:25.46,once Jeff goesshe'll start maybe doing
607,00:34:28.33,00:34:28.33,a little bit more insteadof just thinking about Jeff.
608,00:34:31.21,00:34:31.21,>> Yes!Check it.
609,00:34:33.25,00:34:33.25,"Hey, I can cut themright in half with one cut."
610,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,>> Watch this.You watching?
611,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,">> What are they doing?>> Come here, come here,"
612,00:34:38.88,00:34:38.88,"come here, come here.Come here... come here!"
613,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,">> What's he cutting, coconuts?>> Just watch. Just watch."
614,00:34:43.58,00:34:43.58,"Watch, watch.>> Yes!"
615,00:34:46.33,00:34:46.33,>> You're just doing itto be a bad ass now.
616,00:34:48.29,00:34:48.29,">> Now I am. Heck, yeah.>> She can't do that, okay?"
617,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,>> Okay.>> She's gone.
618,00:34:54.08,00:34:54.08,Or is he going?Still tough?
619,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,>> Still tough.We'll see.
620,00:35:03.00,00:35:03.00,">> Perfect day to leave.Beautiful, warm."
621,00:35:06.04,00:35:06.04,">> We need you.>> I know what you're saying,"
622,00:35:08.79,00:35:08.79,but just let me enjoy thisone day.
623,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,>> It's not logicalto get rid of you.
624,00:35:12.96,00:35:12.96,I think you're afraidthat somebody else is going
625,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,to get voted off.>> Huh?
626,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,">> Well, it isright before Tribal,"
627,00:35:20.38,00:35:20.38,"and, of course, peopleare whispering,"
628,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,and I don't know whatconversations are taking place.
629,00:35:25.54,00:35:25.54,They could be allbe over there conspiring
630,00:35:27.79,00:35:27.79,"and, ""We're notgoing to vote for him."
631,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,"We'll see what his ankle does."">> That's cool."
632,00:35:32.33,00:35:32.33,>> I think that's cool.>> I'm feeling vulnerable.
633,00:35:35.00,00:35:35.00,"I mean, there's no way oftelling what could happen."
634,00:35:37.92,00:35:37.92,I definitely thinkthere's a chance that
635,00:35:39.58,00:35:39.58,Jeff could be here tomorrow.>> PROBST: You guys got to be
636,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,"getting tired of seeing me here.>> Oh, we're tired of it."
637,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,Very tired.>> PROBST: Ibrehem.
638,00:36:06.54,00:36:06.54,"Three immunity challenges,three losses."
639,00:36:08.46,00:36:08.46,"After tonight,three tribe members gone."
640,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,Koror stillstanding strong at nine.
641,00:36:12.88,00:36:12.88,Gotta be a little frustratingto continually get pummeled
642,00:36:15.62,00:36:15.62,"in these challenges.>> Uh, it is very frustrating,"
643,00:36:20.08,00:36:20.08,"but honestly, today,I know if we would have"
644,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,"had one person in therewho we really needed,"
645,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,we would have won.>> PROBST: You're saying
646,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,if you had Jeffyou'd have won the challenge?
647,00:36:28.79,00:36:28.79,">> I'm saying, if we wouldhave had Jeff, we would"
648,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,have won the challenge.>> PROBST: Bobby Jon.
649,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,Jeff reallythe difference in this?
650,00:36:34.96,00:36:34.96,">> No, he wasn't.The difference was,"
651,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,is-is Tom for Koror is what thedifference is.
652,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,"He's a man.He's a man among men,"
653,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,"and he single-handedlywhipped us, I think, today,"
654,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"to be honest with you.>> PROBST: Ibrehem, you're"
655,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,shaking your head.>> I don't think Tom
656,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,single-handedly beat us.Him and his team did it
657,00:36:50.88,00:36:50.88,"together.We did good, but after"
658,00:36:53.25,00:36:53.25,"a while, you know, Bobby Jonhad 80 pounds on him."
659,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,"We just needed that extra man,and that's just point-blank"
660,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,what it was.>> PROBST: Steph.
661,00:37:00.88,00:37:00.88,How long after getting backfrom the challenge
662,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,"did the finger-pointing begin?>> When we got back,"
663,00:37:06.42,00:37:06.42,"actually, Jeff sat us all downand he just pretty much said"
664,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,that he's reallyhurting right now and he
665,00:37:10.92,00:37:10.92,doesn't know how much usehe's going to be to the tribe.
666,00:37:13.17,00:37:13.17,No one really got a chanceto point fingers.
667,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,He just gave us a lot to thinkabout coming into Tribal Council
668,00:37:18.50,00:37:18.50,"tonight.>> PROBST: Jeff, you got"
669,00:37:21.88,00:37:21.88,the weirdest look on your face.You're smiling.
670,00:37:24.17,00:37:24.17,">> You know what?Jeff, I've always been a team"
671,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"player my entire life, and Ireally think that I screwed up"
672,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,"my ankle, and it was a deathfulthing for me as well as my team."
673,00:37:35.46,00:37:35.46,"I'm not saying that we would'vehave won today had I been there,"
674,00:37:38.42,00:37:38.42,but I know that we wouldhave had a better chance.
675,00:37:40.71,00:37:40.71,That would have been 20 poundsoff one of these guys' backs.
676,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> PROBST: What's your point?>> My point is that I want to be
677,00:37:44.75,00:37:44.75,"able to help the tribein any way possible,"
678,00:37:47.04,00:37:47.04,"and at this point,right this second, I can't."
679,00:37:49.58,00:37:49.58,I can't do anything.>> PROBST: Ibrehem.
680,00:37:51.92,00:37:51.92,What are the other reasonsthat you're starting to notice
681,00:37:54.33,00:37:54.33,about why you mightvote people out?
682,00:37:56.58,00:37:56.58,Is it to a point now whereyou're starting to notice who
683,00:37:59.75,00:37:59.75,really is doing the work youneed versus who is starting to
684,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,"say, ""You know, we're okay.I think I can take"
685,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"a nap this afternoon""?>> I think everybody works hard,"
686,00:38:07.38,00:38:07.38,but sometimespeople might get a little tired
687,00:38:11.92,00:38:11.92,and might not wantto put in as much effort
688,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,as everybody else.>> PROBST: But when it comes to
689,00:38:16.71,00:38:16.71,voting somebody out of thegame...
690,00:38:18.54,00:38:18.54,>> That can playa big part in it.
691,00:38:20.71,00:38:20.71,"That can play a big part,in my opinion."
692,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,">> PROBST: Kim, you seemvery frustrated tonight."
693,00:38:26.04,00:38:26.04,">> It's not that I'm frustrated.I mean, I'll admit to you, it's"
694,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,it's hard being on this teamwhen you have these guys
695,00:38:30.71,00:38:30.71,that are super-strong and tonsof stamina and workaholics.
696,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,"Like, I could nevermeasure up to Bobby Jon."
697,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"I mean, he's freaking Tarzan.And it's frustrating losing."
698,00:38:40.25,00:38:40.25,"I'm so sick of being here.I'll be honest with you,"
699,00:38:44.21,00:38:44.21,if he wasn't going homethen I would know
700,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,"that I was one of the peopleon the cutting block,"
701,00:38:48.25,00:38:48.25,"chopping block, whatever,because our tribe's obviously"
702,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,manifested itself to be a tribethat the strongest stay
703,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,"and the weakest go,and it's not that I'm weaker"
704,00:38:58.08,00:38:58.08,"than the average person,it just means in this tribe,"
705,00:39:00.83,00:39:00.83,that might be where I fall.>> PROBST: James.
706,00:39:03.21,00:39:03.21,>> Yeah.>> PROBST: At any time today
707,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,"was there any dilemma,""Do we give him his wish"
708,00:39:08.04,00:39:08.04,"or do we keep him""?>> Yeah, there's been a dilemma."
709,00:39:10.54,00:39:10.54,We've been debating all day longon whether or not to keep Jeff
710,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,"or let him have his way,and we're probably"
711,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,still debating.It's just running through
712,00:39:20.04,00:39:20.04,"our head, you know.We don't even know what we're"
