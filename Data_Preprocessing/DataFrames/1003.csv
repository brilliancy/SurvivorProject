1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.42,00:00:02.42,"Survivor: >> Oh, my God, there were three!"
3,00:00:05.25,00:00:05.25,>> PROBST: With their flint to make fire at the bottom of
4,00:00:07.83,00:00:07.83,"the ocean... >> Oh, no!"
5,00:00:10.71,00:00:10.71,>> PROBST: ...Koror had a horrible night at their new
6,00:00:12.83,00:00:12.83,beach. >> It was a mistake for us
7,00:00:15.08,00:00:15.08,to choose this island. I regret that we didn't
8,00:00:17.25,00:00:17.25,"think it through. >> PROBST: At Ulong, Angie was"
9,00:00:19.42,00:00:19.42,still feeling like an outsider. >> I'm just making myself
10,00:00:24.58,00:00:24.58,"a valuable asset to this tribe. If I don't, I'll probably be on"
11,00:00:29.12,00:00:29.12,the chopping block again. >> PROBST: Survivors ready?
12,00:00:31.42,00:00:31.42,"Go! At the reward challenge,"
13,00:00:35.42,00:00:35.42,the competition was brutal. And Angie redeemed herself.
14,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00,">> Good job, Angie! >> PROBST: Angie is across."
15,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,Ulong wins reward! Ulong walked away
16,00:00:45.38,00:00:45.38,with their first victory as well as fishing gear...
17,00:00:48.21,00:00:48.21,Here's fire-- who wants it? ...and their own flint
18,00:00:50.96,00:00:50.96,to make fire. At Koror...
19,00:00:55.21,00:00:55.21,>> I got it! >> PROBST: Ian saved the day
20,00:00:57.08,00:00:57.08,when he helped salvage the lost flint.
21,00:00:59.54,00:00:59.54,( cheering ) >> Getting the box was like
22,00:01:02.12,00:01:02.12,running a marathon and winning first place.
23,00:01:04.92,00:01:04.92,>> Make love. Don't blow too hard.
24,00:01:07.04,00:01:07.04,>> Who wants theirs first? >> PROBST: Back at Ulong...
25,00:01:10.25,00:01:10.25,">> No, thank you. I'm not hungry."
26,00:01:12.00,00:01:12.00,>> PROBST: Ashlee refused to eat.
27,00:01:14.00,00:01:14.00,">> If we have someone slowing us down, I hope that"
28,00:01:15.62,00:01:15.62,that doesn't bring down our team.
29,00:01:17.17,00:01:17.17,I think I'm going to crash. >> PROBST: And the tribe noticed
30,00:01:20.50,00:01:20.50,sparks between Jeff and Kim. >> Kim's been snuggling
31,00:01:22.67,00:01:22.67,"on Jeff a lot. I mean, two-people alliance"
32,00:01:25.88,00:01:25.88,is a very strong alliance. >> PROBST: At the next
33,00:01:29.54,00:01:29.54,"challenge... Kim, the only one yet to give it"
34,00:01:32.17,00:01:32.17,a go for Ulong. ...Kim held Ulong back.
35,00:01:34.04,00:01:34.04,>> We gotta keep going. We gotta keep going.
36,00:01:36.08,00:01:36.08,>> PROBST: Checking. Checking. >> You sure?
37,00:01:37.83,00:01:37.83,>> PROBST: Koror! >> Yeah!
38,00:01:39.96,00:01:39.96,>> PROBST: Koror won their second immunity in a row.
39,00:01:42.04,00:01:42.04,"Back at Ulong, Stephenie wanted Kim out."
40,00:01:46.71,00:01:46.71,>> We need to break Kim and Jeff up.
41,00:01:49.12,00:01:49.12,"I mean, she didn't even try at the challenge."
42,00:01:51.08,00:01:51.08,She sat out there. >> Yeah.
43,00:01:53.04,00:01:53.04,>> She didn't go underwater. >> PROBST: But there was a
44,00:01:55.08,00:01:55.08,divide in the opinions. >> I was thinking Ashlee.
45,00:01:57.29,00:01:57.29,"She's breaking down, man. I can tell she's breaking down."
46,00:02:01.33,00:02:01.33,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Kim and Jeff's relationship"
47,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,"came out in the open. Kim, when did you feel"
48,00:02:07.75,00:02:07.75,the first initial seeds of any attraction?
49,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,>> It's hot in here all of a sudden.
50,00:02:11.62,00:02:11.62,">> All jokes aside, there's no alliances being built here."
51,00:02:13.71,00:02:13.71,>> PROBST: But when the votes came in...
52,00:02:16.08,00:02:16.08,Second person voted out of Survivor: Palau...
53,00:02:19.50,00:02:19.50,"...Ashlee was sent packing. Ashlee, the tribe has spoken."
54,00:02:23.67,00:02:23.67,16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
55,00:03:47.71,00:03:47.71,>> I really can't go back there again.
56,00:03:49.92,00:03:49.92,Not soon. We cannot lose any more reward.
57,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,"We can't. >> And, oh, Jeff was pretty"
58,00:03:58.79,00:03:58.79,"tough today, I thought. >> That's the way this game"
59,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,"goes, you know? >> Yeah."
60,00:04:03.25,00:04:03.25,I think Tribal Council tonight told a lot 'cause Kim and Jeff
61,00:04:06.21,00:04:06.21,both got votes. If we would have went
62,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,"with our original votes, Ashlee'd still be here,"
63,00:04:10.08,00:04:10.08,"and Kim'd be gone. I think Kim's aware,"
64,00:04:12.79,00:04:12.79,"and I think Jeff's aware, too. >> Are you serious?"
65,00:04:17.42,00:04:17.42,">> Mm-hmm. I know, Jeff totally pinpointed"
66,00:04:20.04,00:04:20.04,"you guys, like, were a couple or something."
67,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,>> I know. It was obnoxious. >> And you know what?
68,00:04:24.46,00:04:24.46,"You can't be like, ""No, we're just like really good friends."""
69,00:04:26.96,00:04:26.96,"You have to be like, ""Oh, yeah, we're kind of attracted"
70,00:04:29.12,00:04:29.12,"to one another."" You know, like..."
71,00:04:31.04,00:04:31.04,>> It pisses me off. It really does piss me off.
72,00:04:33.46,00:04:33.46,">> At Tribal, Jeff was pretty brutal."
73,00:04:35.50,00:04:35.50,He asked me about Kim and I. I just basically said that
74,00:04:38.25,00:04:38.25,we're keeping each other warm. We...
75,00:04:41.25,00:04:41.25,It really does help to have someone next to you.
76,00:04:54.04,00:04:54.04,>> I think the thing between me and Jeff
77,00:04:56.83,00:04:56.83,has just been exaggerated by everybody talking about it.
78,00:05:00.25,00:05:00.25,I don't want people conjuring this image up in their head
79,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,"that's not accurate, and thinking that"
80,00:05:04.71,00:05:04.71,"there's two personal lives, it's like strategy or what."
81,00:05:07.17,00:05:07.17,I don't want that image. >> Jeff Probst asked Kim and
82,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,"Jeff if there's anything going on, you know?"
83,00:05:20.58,00:05:20.58,"And they said, ""No, we're just buddies, cuddling."""
84,00:05:22.71,00:05:22.71,Mm-mm-- everybody sees what they're doing.
85,00:05:24.96,00:05:24.96,"Right now they're cuddling. Next week, they're going to be"
86,00:05:28.08,00:05:28.08,"making out. You know, sucking face"
87,00:05:30.42,00:05:30.42,"and stuff. She's a woman,"
88,00:05:33.21,00:05:33.21,and all she has to her advantage is her sexuality.
89,00:05:35.79,00:05:35.79,Kim's got to go. I'm keeping an eye on them.
90,00:05:39.17,00:05:39.17,"I got ears like a bat, I'm telling you."
91,00:05:45.96,00:05:45.96,( distant thunder rolling ) ( seagulls crying )
92,00:06:00.50,00:06:00.50,">> Oh, man, look at that out there."
93,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,>> It's the shower we were all looking for.
94,00:06:05.58,00:06:05.58,It's been raining a couple times a day.
95,00:06:08.88,00:06:08.88,"We have kind of a lame shelter, and we're kind of limited"
96,00:06:12.04,00:06:12.04,"to supplies here. We're getting wet at night,"
97,00:06:14.00,00:06:14.00,and we need a better shelter. >> I've been digging and
98,00:06:16.92,00:06:16.92,digging-- a heavy day it's been. I was not gonna let it go.
99,00:06:19.42,00:06:19.42,I'm trying to focus on that damn shelter.
100,00:06:21.38,00:06:21.38,"It's been three days, and it's still not finished."
101,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,"This is just going to take a little thinking, girls."
102,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50,( grunting ) Nine strong has its
103,00:06:28.04,00:06:28.04,"advantages and disadvantages, 'cause, obviously,"
104,00:06:30.08,00:06:30.08,"we're all still together, we're still strong."
105,00:06:32.21,00:06:32.21,"Yeah, I think people are grating their nerves even worse"
106,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,"'cause, you know, you can't ever get rid of anybody."
107,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,You know you're stuck with them. >> I need to ask you something.
108,00:06:39.25,00:06:39.25,"If you can find more bamboo, do you think you can?"
109,00:06:41.33,00:06:41.33,>> It's hard to find. >> Even getting something
110,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,on the other side if possible to block out the...
111,00:06:45.83,00:06:45.83,Someone needs to get up in that tree and do the top.
112,00:06:47.88,00:06:47.88,Don't you think? >> Yeah.
113,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,>> Won't be me. >> Katie is a very...
114,00:06:53.04,00:06:53.04,"I don't know what the word is; it's not outspoken,"
115,00:06:56.08,00:06:56.08,"it's tart, you know? Just that she has something"
116,00:06:58.42,00:06:58.42,to say all the time about everything.
117,00:07:00.58,00:07:00.58,>> What are you going to do with those?
118,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,>> I'm just filling gaps here. >> I'm thinking we could use
119,00:07:08.21,00:07:08.21,"those for the bed. >> There's more, a lot more."
120,00:07:11.04,00:07:11.04,And it's especially true with me.
121,00:07:13.33,00:07:13.33,"For seven days, I've been not saying anything,"
122,00:07:15.75,00:07:15.75,and I've just had it. And I just decided to confront
123,00:07:18.46,00:07:18.46,her; I want it to stop. And I've just had enough!
124,00:07:22.25,00:07:22.25,"Now, I don't want to make waves. >> And you're making waves."
125,00:07:24.08,00:07:24.08,">> No, this is between you and me."
126,00:07:26.83,00:07:26.83,I'm not making a scene in front of the tribe.
127,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,And I don't want to bring anyone else into this.
128,00:07:30.58,00:07:30.58,">> Why are you all freaked out? >> Because everything I say,"
129,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,you have some snotty remark. I throw a freakin' stick
130,00:07:36.04,00:07:36.04,"in the fire, you're like, ""Oh, they say don't throw"
131,00:07:38.04,00:07:38.04,"sticks in the fire."" Don't tell me what to do, Katie!"
132,00:07:39.92,00:07:39.92,Don't tell me what to do anymore.
133,00:07:42.29,00:07:42.29,I'm done hearing it. >> I was just sitting
134,00:07:44.75,00:07:44.75,on the edge of the boat. She just comes up to me
135,00:07:46.88,00:07:46.88,"and she's, like, ""Do you have a problem with me?"""
136,00:07:49.25,00:07:49.25,"And I'm like, ""What?"" And I started laughing"
137,00:07:51.50,00:07:51.50,"'cause she was so irate. >> You said the guys said,"
138,00:07:53.88,00:07:53.88,"""Don't throw sticks in the fire,"" like, everything I say,"
139,00:07:56.08,00:07:56.08,you're on me. Get off me!
140,00:08:00.08,00:08:00.08,>> She wouldn't even give me the time to respond
141,00:08:02.38,00:08:02.38,to any of her accusations. She wanted to come up to me
142,00:08:05.25,00:08:05.25,and just tell me off. And then she went off
143,00:08:07.25,00:08:07.25,and she left. She turns and frowns.
144,00:08:09.00,00:08:09.00,"Like, I couldn't stop laughing. She's crazy."
145,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,She's completely lost it. I don't need you yelling at me.
146,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,I think there's a better way of doing this.
147,00:08:15.46,00:08:15.46,>> Okay. >> If there wasn't any
148,00:08:17.17,00:08:17.17,"animosity, there is now, 'cause I don't like"
149,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,people yelling at me. >> The repercussions of my
150,00:08:21.58,00:08:21.58,"confronting Katie will be that she will not talk to me,"
151,00:08:24.17,00:08:24.17,"and that's just fine with me. Unfortunately,"
152,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,there might be some tension around the tribe as well.
153,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,You will always run the risk if you're too confrontational
154,00:08:32.58,00:08:32.58,"of being the one who's voted off, but I haven't heard"
155,00:08:34.96,00:08:34.96,my name come up. It could change now
156,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,as a result of what I did. >> PROBST: I'll now bring in
157,00:08:52.42,00:08:52.42,the new Ulong tribe. Ashlee voted out
158,00:08:56.46,00:08:56.46,"at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready"
159,00:09:00.79,00:09:00.79,for today's challenge? >> We're ready.
160,00:09:02.67,00:09:02.67,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Today's challenge
161,00:09:04.54,00:09:04.54,is for a reward. It is once again physical.
162,00:09:06.79,00:09:06.79,"Here's how it works. On my go,"
163,00:09:09.00,00:09:09.00,a life ring will be released from the bottom of the ocean.
164,00:09:11.67,00:09:11.67,"Your goal? Swim out, retrieve the ring,"
165,00:09:15.21,00:09:15.21,bring it back to your tribe-colored pontoon.
166,00:09:17.33,00:09:17.33,First tribe member to get a hand on the pontoon
167,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,while having a hand on the life ring
168,00:09:22.00,00:09:22.00,scores a point for their tribe. Here's the catch.
169,00:09:24.92,00:09:24.92,Aside from punching or otherwise intentionally
170,00:09:27.08,00:09:27.08,"trying to hurt someone, you can pretty much do whatever"
171,00:09:30.83,00:09:30.83,you want to get that ring and keep it and get back.
172,00:09:34.00,00:09:34.00,"Push, pull, dunk, splash, keeping in mind that ultimately"
173,00:09:39.21,00:09:39.21,"this is a social game. And to win it,"
174,00:09:42.21,00:09:42.21,you will need the votes of the people you are living
175,00:09:44.92,00:09:44.92,"with and competing against. How you play it,"
176,00:09:47.25,00:09:47.25,"ultimately up to you. First round, one man"
177,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,"from each tribe will square off. Second round, one woman"
178,00:09:53.21,00:09:53.21,"from each tribe will square off. After that,"
179,00:09:55.92,00:09:55.92,we'll switch things up. First tribe to score three
180,00:09:58.25,00:09:58.25,wins reward. Want to know what
181,00:10:00.92,00:10:00.92,you're playing for? >> Yes.
182,00:10:02.79,00:10:02.79,>> PROBST: Full-on sewing kit. >> Nice.
183,00:10:06.17,00:10:06.17,">> Yes! >> PROBST: I'm looking around,"
184,00:10:08.21,00:10:08.21,I see a lot of people in underwear.
185,00:10:10.25,00:10:10.25,We've got three buffs working as skirts.
186,00:10:12.21,00:10:12.21,"So, hopefully, the reward will change"
187,00:10:14.25,00:10:14.25,"the way you guys look. But if you are resourceful,"
188,00:10:17.12,00:10:17.12,there are a lot of items you can use around camp.
189,00:10:19.67,00:10:19.67,"Worth playing for? >> Hell, yeah."

268,00:15:29.17,00:15:29.17,Mmm... That's what I'm talking about.
269,00:15:31.79,00:15:31.79,We kicked tail today and we won a lot of things.
270,00:15:35.42,00:15:35.42,We can make a lot of different types of garments.
271,00:15:37.58,00:15:37.58,We have so many tools. >> Look.
272,00:15:40.12,00:15:40.12,>> This is elastic. >> You could use these...

275,00:15:48.21,00:15:48.21,I'm not a sewer. I'm not a seamstress.
276,00:15:50.54,00:15:50.54,I have no idea what I could do with it.
277,00:15:52.62,00:15:52.62,"Buttons, and a jar. We can do something"
278,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,"with this jar. >> This here, you..."
279,00:15:56.08,00:15:56.08,"That's is going to be our fishing line, right?"
280,00:15:58.25,00:15:58.25,">> Yep, that little red, gold stick."

284,00:16:07.75,00:16:07.75,"whatnot, whatever, and, uh, we'll get some of the minnows."
285,00:16:10.46,00:16:10.46,">> That sounds good. >> Yeah, go get some minnows."
286,00:16:12.67,00:16:12.67,">> So we need to get some wood up, too, before it"
287,00:16:14.79,00:16:14.79,"starts getting wet, 'cause it's going to for sure rain."
288,00:16:17.21,00:16:17.21,It rains every afternoon here. The win today definitely gave
289,00:16:19.75,00:16:19.75,us a huge momentum boost. We still got a few things
290,00:16:22.42,00:16:22.42,"to do, though. There's a lot of stuff right now"
291,00:16:24.75,00:16:24.75,"that's not done that we need to do,"
292,00:16:26.75,00:16:26.75,"so I'm just kind of like, if I gotta do it, then I'll do it."
293,00:16:37.58,00:16:37.58,">> It's not much, but I think they'll like it."
294,00:16:45.17,00:16:45.17,">> What are we going to do, just sit here?"
295,00:16:49.04,00:16:49.04,>> Looks like everybody died. >> I'm very disappointed
296,00:16:55.42,00:16:55.42,"in my tribe right now. I mean, there's little things"
297,00:16:57.92,00:16:57.92,that have to be done. I'm not going to wait for
298,00:17:00.42,00:17:00.42,everybody to have a group meeting.
299,00:17:02.75,00:17:02.75,"Let's decide. Well, we need to decide"
300,00:17:05.00,00:17:05.00,"and that's time, and time's wasting."
301,00:17:07.46,00:17:07.46,">> Oh, so close. >> You know, the first few days,"
302,00:17:10.67,00:17:10.67,it was fine. I like doing stuff for people.
303,00:17:13.17,00:17:13.17,"But, man, they're going to let you do everything out here"
304,00:17:15.54,00:17:15.54,if you keep on doing it. ( stick thudding on coconuts )
305,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,>> Goodness. ( thudding )
306,00:17:20.92,00:17:20.92,"There you go. >> Especially Kim, I don't think"
307,00:17:23.46,00:17:23.46,she understands the value of work.
308,00:17:25.83,00:17:25.83,There's lots and lots of work to do.
309,00:17:27.96,00:17:27.96,She doesn't really see that. >> Are you tired?
310,00:17:31.92,00:17:31.92,>> No. >> Are you crazy?
311,00:17:34.08,00:17:34.08,>> Yeah. >> Bobby Jon really works his
312,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"booty off, almost to the point where we are constantly"
313,00:17:40.67,00:17:40.67,"telling him to sit down, you need to chill out."
314,00:17:44.08,00:17:44.08,I think he's playing his cards in the beginning to be safe
315,00:17:48.29,00:17:48.29,"and cement his place into the group, and he'll be of no use"
316,00:17:51.38,00:17:51.38,"if, you know, he keeps doing this for two weeks and, like,"
317,00:17:54.96,00:17:54.96,crashes and burns. >> We all took a walk down the
318,00:18:08.46,00:18:08.46,beach and spotted a couple of banded sea snakes.
319,00:18:13.42,00:18:13.42,"It's definitely a sea krait, so just be careful."
320,00:18:15.92,00:18:15.92,"They are very venomous, one of the most venomous snakes"
321,00:18:18.46,00:18:18.46,"there is. We're hungry,"
322,00:18:21.25,00:18:21.25,and it was a big motivation. The plan was to just
323,00:18:24.67,00:18:24.67,"pin it down, hold it down and then lop off its head."
324,00:18:27.04,00:18:27.04,"Okay, I can take one chop and be done."
325,00:18:29.33,00:18:29.33,">> They are poisonous snakes. They're very poisonous snakes,"
326,00:18:32.17,00:18:32.17,"and they can cause cardiac arrest, coma..."
327,00:18:35.12,00:18:35.12,"they can cause death, um, with just one bite."
328,00:18:37.46,00:18:37.46,Ready? >> Go.
329,00:18:41.12,00:18:41.12,>> Chop the snake! Chop the snake!
330,00:18:43.04,00:18:43.04,>> We got him. >> Keep going.
331,00:18:44.71,00:18:44.71,">> Sorry, buddy. I'm sorry, buddy."
332,00:18:46.58,00:18:46.58,>> Ian chopped the snake's head off.
333,00:18:48.79,00:18:48.79,"He was so cute. Like the whole time, he's all,"
334,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,"""Sorry, buddy, sorry, man. Just got to do it, man, sorry."""
335,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,"( yells ) >> Okay, here's dinner."
336,00:18:55.96,00:18:55.96,">> You know, I work with dolphins."
337,00:18:58.42,00:18:58.42,"I love animals, so to just kill a snake outright"
338,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,"and in cold blood wasn't for me. So, I did feel bad."
339,00:19:04.79,00:19:04.79,">> Oh, no! >> Koror!"
340,00:19:07.38,00:19:07.38,"Even without a head, I'm still not convinced"
341,00:19:09.96,00:19:09.96,he isn't going to bite me. >> I was going to head back
342,00:19:13.12,00:19:13.12,with Katie and Jenn to start the fire.
343,00:19:15.71,00:19:15.71,"Tom and Ian, they found three more snakes, and"
344,00:19:17.62,00:19:17.62,"they're, like, ""Let's get these while we can."""
345,00:19:19.50,00:19:19.50,>> Nice little hari-kari stroke. >> Are you ready? One...
346,00:19:23.17,00:19:23.17,">> Make it hard. One, two, three."
347,00:19:27.21,00:19:27.21,>> He against the wall? You got him?
348,00:19:29.08,00:19:29.08,">> Yeah, I got him pinned. >> So he'll come out to fight."
349,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"When his head comes out, man, lop it off."
350,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,There it is. There it is. Get that head.
351,00:19:36.08,00:19:36.08,>> You got him? >> We got him.
352,00:19:38.21,00:19:38.21,">> Got him? >> That's it, Gregg."
353,00:19:39.67,00:19:39.67,">> Look, he's got something in him, too, right, he just ate."
354,00:19:42.67,00:19:42.67,>> That's what we saw. >> So it was maybe
355,00:19:44.75,00:19:44.75,"a little foolhardy, a little sense of adventure,"
356,00:19:46.75,00:19:46.75,"but, um... obviously I've hooked up"
357,00:19:49.12,00:19:49.12,"with two other knuckleheads who, uh, take fun in the"
358,00:19:53.58,00:19:53.58,excitement of things like this. And we're through.
359,00:19:57.21,00:19:57.21,>> Yes! >> Ah!
360,00:20:00.88,00:20:00.88,"We kind of let the carcasses of the snakes hang out,"
361,00:20:05.79,00:20:05.79,"but as soon as we hung them from the tree over the water,"
362,00:20:08.04,00:20:08.04,we also noticed that a young shark
363,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,came swimming and kept making closer passes to it.
364,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,">> Oh, there it is. That thing right there."
365,00:20:14.83,00:20:14.83,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know it might be the blood"
366,00:20:17.79,00:20:17.79,from the snakes dripping in the water.
367,00:20:19.96,00:20:19.96,We kind of got interested that maybe we could trade
368,00:20:22.25,00:20:22.25,our snake with a shark. >> A few of 'em...
369,00:20:25.04,00:20:25.04,">> If I saw a shark at Jones Beach on Long Island,"
370,00:20:29.04,00:20:29.04,we would all be running out of the water.
371,00:20:31.08,00:20:31.08,"We see a shark fin go by here, everybody runs into the water"
372,00:20:33.96,00:20:33.96,with sticks in their hands. >> Probably the stupidest thing
373,00:20:36.12,00:20:36.12,"I've done in a while, but... >> You know,"
374,00:20:38.46,00:20:38.46,the motivation is there; we have to get food in us.
375,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,>> See 'em? >> They see it.
376,00:20:46.50,00:20:46.50,"Yup, they're coming closer. >> Oh, my gosh."
377,00:20:50.92,00:20:50.92,">> Oh, my friggin' gosh. >> You think they're interested"

384,00:21:08.62,00:21:08.62,some more snake? They really were close.
385,00:21:10.67,00:21:10.67,They were wily. Close enough to make you
386,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,"nervous, like, they come straight at you and make you a"
387,00:21:16.00,00:21:16.00,"little bit heebie-jeebie. Yeah, that's good stuff."
388,00:21:18.38,00:21:18.38,"Nice and bloody. Oh, that's nice and bloody."
389,00:21:20.58,00:21:20.58,">> It's a game of survival as well as strategy,"
390,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,and the survival aspect of it is more real
391,00:21:25.46,00:21:25.46,"than I ever imagined, and also, the thought of having"
392,00:21:28.04,00:21:28.04,shark steaks on a frying pan is the motivation that takes
393,00:21:31.38,00:21:31.38,you past the fear of a shark. >> There he is.
394,00:21:34.62,00:21:34.62,"Oh, my gosh, he's right there. Uh, two."
395,00:21:38.29,00:21:38.29,"Two left. Oh, man."
396,00:21:40.04,00:21:40.04,There's three of them around. Bam! Bam! He took it.
397,00:21:46.04,00:21:46.04,Got really close. >> They would get to just out
398,00:21:50.04,00:21:50.04,of reach of us. I took a lunge at one
399,00:21:52.46,00:21:52.46,"and missed, but they knew we were there,"
400,00:21:54.71,00:21:54.71,"and would just probe so far, but no closer."
401,00:21:57.67,00:21:57.67,"We had sharpened sticks, which I don't think would"
402,00:22:00.00,00:22:00.00,really go through shark skin. He's big enough to put a

404,00:22:04.00,00:22:04.00,We're going to back off the... the snakes and redouble our
405,00:22:07.67,00:22:07.67,"effort on the sharks, I think is our plan right now."
406,00:22:10.92,00:22:10.92,We're going to get a shark. >> Ow.
407,00:22:32.12,00:22:32.12,"Going out to use the little boys' room real quick,"
408,00:22:35.79,00:22:35.79,"and came walking down the beach, stepped on a loose coconut."
409,00:22:39.50,00:22:39.50,"Just my luck, rolled it on my ankle that I had problems with"
410,00:22:43.25,00:22:43.25,last year. I'm just going to try
411,00:22:45.67,00:22:45.67,"and keep it up right now. Hopefully,"
412,00:22:48.04,00:22:48.04,get all the fluids out of it. Maybe wake up in the morning
413,00:22:50.29,00:22:50.29,and be a new man. Let's hope.
414,00:23:11.62,00:23:11.62,">> What's up, buddy? >> How you doing?"
415,00:23:14.12,00:23:14.12,>> Pretty good. How are you? >> I'm all right.

418,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50,"You need help, but I'm not going to help you."
419,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,">> Right, right, right, right. No, it's all good."
420,00:23:37.08,00:23:37.08,>> There's a lot on my mind this morning.

423,00:23:44.54,00:23:44.54,"but the pain is still there, so I'm going to try"
424,00:23:47.21,00:23:47.21,"and take it easy today and, you know, I want to try"
425,00:23:49.96,00:23:49.96,and save my energy until maybe our next challenge
426,00:23:52.58,00:23:52.58,so that I can do my best. >> We got a challenge.
427,00:24:06.04,00:24:06.04,>> We got a challenge? >> Yeah.
428,00:24:08.83,00:24:08.83,>> How's your ankle feel? >> Horrible.

447,00:25:20.79,00:25:20.79,you were hobbling in here. What happened?
448,00:25:22.38,00:25:22.38,>> I rolled it last night in the middle of the night
449,00:25:24.92,00:25:24.92,"on a coconut, and heard a snap, crackle, pop."

454,00:25:35.38,00:25:35.38,to be wearing a belt. That belt will be clipped
455,00:25:38.08,00:25:38.08,"to a common rope, so you will move together"
456,00:25:40.42,00:25:40.42,"as a tribe. In addition,"

461,00:25:54.08,00:25:54.08,"opt out of the challenge, but they have"

463,00:25:58.04,00:25:58.04,"tribe member, then unclip. So they're out of the challenge,"
464,00:26:01.08,00:26:01.08,but the weight is still in the challenge.
465,00:26:02.96,00:26:02.96,Somebody will have to carry that burden.
466,00:26:04.79,00:26:04.79,First tribe to catch the other tribe and touch one

469,00:26:13.17,00:26:13.17,somebody going home tonight. Big enough stakes?

567,00:32:33.62,00:32:33.62,"I'm not, I mean... >> You don't even think,"
568,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,"like, a couple of days...? >> To tell you the truth..."
569,00:32:37.25,00:32:37.25,There's no way. I can barely put
570,00:32:39.50,00:32:39.50,any weight on it right now without clenching my teeth.
571,00:32:42.12,00:32:42.12,"Like, every time I step, I feel like a tear is going"
572,00:32:45.42,00:32:45.42,"to come out of my eye. If I stay in here, you guys"
573,00:32:48.42,00:32:48.42,aren't gonna get to the end. >> I don't want you
574,00:32:51.46,00:32:51.46,"to leave here, though, and in two days your ankle"
575,00:32:53.62,00:32:53.62,will be feeling fine and us be like...
576,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,>> So we're going to vote out someone else instead?
577,00:32:58.75,00:32:58.75,There's no reason to vote off anybody else.
578,00:33:02.38,00:33:02.38,"All right? >> Yeah, we want you to stay."
579,00:33:07.12,00:33:07.12,">> Soon as we got back to the beach, old Jeff said, ""Guys,"
580,00:33:10.79,00:33:10.79,"you need to vote me off."" Oh, we were sad, you know."
581,00:33:14.46,00:33:14.46,"We didn't want to vote him out. He's strong, you know, he does a"
582,00:33:17.88,00:33:17.88,"lot around here, you know? And the person we were planning"
583,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,"on voting out, which is Kim, does hardly anything."
584,00:33:24.83,00:33:24.83,">> We vote Jeff off, it's going to be like two people gone"
585,00:33:27.46,00:33:27.46,"anyway, 'cause she ain't did none of the challenges."
586,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,She ain't do nothing around the camp.
587,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,">> Yeah, she's down there laying up, ain't doing nothing"
588,00:33:33.50,00:33:33.50,down there. >> She's so happy 'cause she
589,00:33:35.17,00:33:35.17,thinks she's okay tonight. >> That boy's tough.
590,00:33:37.88,00:33:37.88,">> Yeah, I'd rather, nurture him and feed him."
591,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,I feel very strongly that Jeff should stay.
592,00:33:42.42,00:33:42.42,We should get rid of Kim for sure tonight.
593,00:33:46.04,00:33:46.04,"Jeff's weakness is our strength. Even when he's down, he's ten"
594,00:33:49.12,00:33:49.12,times stronger than Kim. I'm definitely going to go talk
595,00:33:51.96,00:33:51.96,with other people in the tribe and see what they think.
596,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,">> Bobby Jon, I don't know about you,"
597,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,"but just to let you know, I'm voting for Jeff."
598,00:34:01.58,00:34:01.58,">> You are? >> Oh, yeah."
599,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,I planed on voting for Jeff as soon as he hurt his ankle.
600,00:34:06.88,00:34:06.88,>> Okay. >> And I'm not swaying from it.
601,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,">> Okay, cool. Well, I ain't voting for him,"
602,00:34:13.08,00:34:13.08,"'cause I'm voting for Kim, because I'll be danged"
603,00:34:15.75,00:34:15.75,if I'm going to feed somebody when they don't do nothing.
604,00:34:18.46,00:34:18.46,>> Yeah. Some of the other tribe members
605,00:34:21.12,00:34:21.12,"want to vote off Kim, and I can see that"
606,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,"because she didn't really do much, but I'm kind of hoping"
607,00:34:25.46,00:34:25.46,once Jeff goes she'll start maybe doing
608,00:34:28.33,00:34:28.33,a little bit more instead of just thinking about Jeff.
609,00:34:31.21,00:34:31.21,>> Yes! Check it.
610,00:34:33.25,00:34:33.25,"Hey, I can cut them right in half with one cut."
611,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,>> Watch this. You watching?
612,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,">> What are they doing? >> Come here, come here,"
613,00:34:38.88,00:34:38.88,"come here, come here. Come here... come here!"
614,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,">> What's he cutting, coconuts? >> Just watch. Just watch."
615,00:34:43.58,00:34:43.58,"Watch, watch. >> Yes!"
616,00:34:46.33,00:34:46.33,>> You're just doing it to be a bad ass now.
617,00:34:48.29,00:34:48.29,">> Now I am. Heck, yeah. >> She can't do that, okay?"
618,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,>> Okay. >> She's gone.
619,00:34:54.08,00:34:54.08,Or is he going? Still tough?
620,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,>> Still tough. We'll see.
621,00:35:03.00,00:35:03.00,">> Perfect day to leave. Beautiful, warm."
622,00:35:06.04,00:35:06.04,">> We need you. >> I know what you're saying,"
623,00:35:08.79,00:35:08.79,but just let me enjoy this one day.
624,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,>> It's not logical to get rid of you.
625,00:35:12.96,00:35:12.96,I think you're afraid that somebody else is going
626,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,to get voted off. >> Huh?
627,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,">> Well, it is right before Tribal,"
628,00:35:20.38,00:35:20.38,"and, of course, people are whispering,"
629,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,and I don't know what conversations are taking place.
630,00:35:25.54,00:35:25.54,They could be all be over there conspiring
631,00:35:27.79,00:35:27.79,"and, ""We're not going to vote for him."
632,00:35:29.96,00:35:29.96,"We'll see what his ankle does."" >> That's cool."
633,00:35:32.33,00:35:32.33,>> I think that's cool. >> I'm feeling vulnerable.
634,00:35:35.00,00:35:35.00,"I mean, there's no way of telling what could happen."
635,00:35:37.92,00:35:37.92,I definitely think there's a chance that
636,00:35:39.58,00:35:39.58,Jeff could be here tomorrow. >> PROBST: You guys got to be
637,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,"getting tired of seeing me here. >> Oh, we're tired of it."
638,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,Very tired. >> PROBST: Ibrehem.
639,00:36:06.54,00:36:06.54,"Three immunity challenges, three losses."
640,00:36:08.46,00:36:08.46,"After tonight, three tribe members gone."
641,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,Koror still standing strong at nine.
642,00:36:12.88,00:36:12.88,Gotta be a little frustrating to continually get pummeled
643,00:36:15.62,00:36:15.62,"in these challenges. >> Uh, it is very frustrating,"
644,00:36:20.08,00:36:20.08,"but honestly, today, I know if we would have"
645,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,"had one person in there who we really needed,"
646,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,we would have won. >> PROBST: You're saying
647,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,if you had Jeff you'd have won the challenge?
648,00:36:28.79,00:36:28.79,">> I'm saying, if we would have had Jeff, we would"
649,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,have won the challenge. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon.
650,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,Jeff really the difference in this?
651,00:36:34.96,00:36:34.96,">> No, he wasn't. The difference was,"
652,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,is-is Tom for Koror is what the difference is.
653,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,"He's a man. He's a man among men,"
654,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,"and he single-handedly whipped us, I think, today,"
655,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"to be honest with you. >> PROBST: Ibrehem, you're"
656,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,shaking your head. >> I don't think Tom
657,00:36:49.12,00:36:49.12,single-handedly beat us. Him and his team did it
658,00:36:50.88,00:36:50.88,"together. We did good, but after"
659,00:36:53.25,00:36:53.25,"a while, you know, Bobby Jon had 80 pounds on him."
660,00:36:55.58,00:36:55.58,"We just needed that extra man, and that's just point-blank"
661,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,what it was. >> PROBST: Steph.
662,00:37:00.88,00:37:00.88,How long after getting back from the challenge
663,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,"did the finger-pointing begin? >> When we got back,"
664,00:37:06.42,00:37:06.42,"actually, Jeff sat us all down and he just pretty much said"
665,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,that he's really hurting right now and he
666,00:37:10.92,00:37:10.92,doesn't know how much use he's going to be to the tribe.
667,00:37:13.17,00:37:13.17,No one really got a chance to point fingers.
668,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,He just gave us a lot to think about coming into Tribal Council
669,00:37:18.50,00:37:18.50,"tonight. >> PROBST: Jeff, you got"
670,00:37:21.88,00:37:21.88,the weirdest look on your face. You're smiling.
671,00:37:24.17,00:37:24.17,">> You know what? Jeff, I've always been a team"
672,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"player my entire life, and I really think that I screwed up"
673,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,"my ankle, and it was a deathful thing for me as well as my team."
674,00:37:35.46,00:37:35.46,"I'm not saying that we would've have won today had I been there,"
675,00:37:38.42,00:37:38.42,but I know that we would have had a better chance.
676,00:37:40.71,00:37:40.71,That would have been 20 pounds off one of these guys' backs.
677,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> PROBST: What's your point? >> My point is that I want to be
678,00:37:44.75,00:37:44.75,"able to help the tribe in any way possible,"
679,00:37:47.04,00:37:47.04,"and at this point, right this second, I can't."
680,00:37:49.58,00:37:49.58,I can't do anything. >> PROBST: Ibrehem.
681,00:37:51.92,00:37:51.92,What are the other reasons that you're starting to notice
682,00:37:54.33,00:37:54.33,about why you might vote people out?
683,00:37:56.58,00:37:56.58,Is it to a point now where you're starting to notice who
684,00:37:59.75,00:37:59.75,really is doing the work you need versus who is starting to
685,00:38:03.08,00:38:03.08,"say, ""You know, we're okay. I think I can take"
686,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"a nap this afternoon""? >> I think everybody works hard,"
687,00:38:07.38,00:38:07.38,but sometimes people might get a little tired
688,00:38:11.92,00:38:11.92,and might not want to put in as much effort
689,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,as everybody else. >> PROBST: But when it comes to
690,00:38:16.71,00:38:16.71,voting somebody out of the game...
691,00:38:18.54,00:38:18.54,>> That can play a big part in it.
692,00:38:20.71,00:38:20.71,"That can play a big part, in my opinion."
693,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,">> PROBST: Kim, you seem very frustrated tonight."
694,00:38:26.04,00:38:26.04,">> It's not that I'm frustrated. I mean, I'll admit to you, it's"
695,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,it's hard being on this team when you have these guys
696,00:38:30.71,00:38:30.71,that are super-strong and tons of stamina and workaholics.
697,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,"Like, I could never measure up to Bobby Jon."
698,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"I mean, he's freaking Tarzan. And it's frustrating losing."
699,00:38:40.25,00:38:40.25,"I'm so sick of being here. I'll be honest with you,"
700,00:38:44.21,00:38:44.21,if he wasn't going home then I would know
701,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,"that I was one of the people on the cutting block,"
702,00:38:48.25,00:38:48.25,"chopping block, whatever, because our tribe's obviously"
703,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,manifested itself to be a tribe that the strongest stay
704,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,"and the weakest go, and it's not that I'm weaker"
705,00:38:58.08,00:38:58.08,"than the average person, it just means in this tribe,"
706,00:39:00.83,00:39:00.83,that might be where I fall. >> PROBST: James.
707,00:39:03.21,00:39:03.21,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: At any time today
708,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,"was there any dilemma, ""Do we give him his wish"
709,00:39:08.04,00:39:08.04,"or do we keep him""? >> Yeah, there's been a dilemma."
710,00:39:10.54,00:39:10.54,We've been debating all day long on whether or not to keep Jeff
711,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,"or let him have his way, and we're probably"
712,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,still debating. It's just running through
713,00:39:20.04,00:39:20.04,"our head, you know. We don't even know what we're"
714,00:39:23.08,00:39:23.08,going to do until we do it. >> PROBST: Clearly this tribe
715,00:39:25.21,00:39:25.21,has not yet made up its mind. Let's see which way
716,00:39:27.42,00:39:27.42,you're going to go. It is time to vote.
717,00:39:29.17,00:39:29.17,"James, you're up. >> Kim... you are lazy."
718,00:39:41.50,00:39:41.50,You don't do anything. You get out
719,00:39:43.88,00:39:43.88,of the race a day early. You are not a helper.
720,00:40:00.08,00:40:00.08,>> You've become one of my greatest friends
721,00:40:02.17,00:40:02.17,"on this island. I'm happy I got to know you, but"
722,00:40:05.21,00:40:05.21,"this is what you wanted, so this what is I'm going to do."
723,00:40:19.50,00:40:19.50,">> Everything's fine, but tonight I'm not going to play"
724,00:40:22.38,00:40:22.38,you and Jeff's little silly-ass game.
725,00:40:31.17,00:40:31.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
726,00:40:44.54,00:40:44.54,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
727,00:40:46.33,00:40:46.33,The person voted out will be asked to leave
728,00:40:48.21,00:40:48.21,the Tribal Council area immediately.
729,00:40:49.54,00:40:49.54,I'll read the votes. First vote.
730,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,Jeff. Jeff.
731,00:40:59.58,00:40:59.58,Two votes Jeff. James.
732,00:41:07.92,00:41:07.92,"Kim. Two votes Jeff,"
733,00:41:10.38,00:41:10.38,"one vote James, one vote Kim. Kim."
734,00:41:14.50,00:41:14.50,"That's two votes Kim. Two votes Jeff, one vote James."
735,00:41:21.25,00:41:21.25,"Jeff. We're three votes Jeff,"
736,00:41:23.75,00:41:23.75,"two votes Kim, one vote James. I'll read the last vote."
737,00:41:29.08,00:41:29.08,Third person voted out of Survivor: Palau.
738,00:41:31.46,00:41:31.46,Jeff. You need to bring me your torch.
739,00:41:40.12,00:41:40.12,">> Kill Koror. >> PROBST: Jeff,"
740,00:41:42.58,00:41:42.58,the tribe has spoken. Time to go.
741,00:41:57.21,00:41:57.21,You had a tough first eight days.
742,00:41:59.29,00:41:59.29,"So the question is, how do you turn tonight's vote"
743,00:42:02.96,00:42:02.96,"into something positive? Grab your torches,"
744,00:42:05.58,00:42:05.58,head back to camp. Good night.
745,00:42:19.46,00:42:19.46,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
