622,00:25:50.71,00:25:50.71,YOU CAN'T BE HONEST BACK.
623,00:25:53.96,00:25:53.96,"THANK YOU, RUSSELL."
624,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,HE'S GOT IT.
625,00:25:58.38,00:25:58.38,IT'S ALL RIGHT.
626,00:25:59.38,00:25:59.38,I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE.
627,00:26:00.38,00:26:00.38,I DIDN'T NEED IT.
628,00:26:01.79,00:26:01.79,I'LL PLAY HIS GAME.
629,00:26:03.71,00:26:03.71,I'LL SHOW HIM HOW SMART I CAN BE.
630,00:26:05.75,00:26:05.75,RIGHT ON.
631,00:26:10.88,00:26:10.88,>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
632,00:26:13.21,00:26:13.21,RALPH WENT OFF.
633,00:26:15.38,00:26:15.38,HE SAID HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.
634,00:26:17.46,00:26:17.46,"HE'S LIKE, ""I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME, TOO."""
635,00:26:20.21,00:26:20.21,REALLY? REALLY?

640,00:26:50.29,00:26:50.29,I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
641,00:26:52.92,00:26:52.92,I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT
642,00:26:54.12,00:26:54.12,PERSON COMES TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
643,00:26:55.46,00:26:55.46,I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DUEL IS GOING TO ENTAIL.
644,00:26:58.38,00:26:58.38,>> AND I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO COEXIST HERE FOR A WHILE.
645,00:27:01.58,00:27:01.58,"THAT WOULD SUCK, ESPECIALLY IF THAT PERSON WAS PHILLIP."
646,00:27:23.04,00:27:23.04,>> I'D LIKE TO SPEAK FOR A
647,00:27:25.04,00:27:25.04,SECOND LIKE WE DID AFTER THE LAST CHALLENGE.
648,00:27:27.46,00:27:27.46,I'LL BE VERY BRIEF.
649,00:27:29.75,00:27:29.75,"COULD YOU COME OVER FOR A SECOND, MATT?"
650,00:27:31.75,00:27:31.75,THANKS.

656,00:27:48.21,00:27:48.21,YOU WERE OUTSTANDING.
657,00:27:50.67,00:27:50.67,YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR EFFORT.
658,00:27:52.33,00:27:52.33,I ONLY WISH I COULD HAVE
659,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,PERFORMED IN MY MOMENT AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU DID TODAY.
660,00:27:59.33,00:27:59.33,"AND HAVING SAID THAT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WON'T BE RUNNING"
661,00:28:03.25,00:28:03.25,"AROUND SAYING, ""WILL YOU DO THIS, WILL YOU DO THAT?"""
662,00:28:05.71,00:28:05.71,THE NEXT THING THAT WENT ON A FEW DAYS AGO.
663,00:28:08.21,00:28:08.21,IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
664,00:28:09.58,00:28:09.58,I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE TRIBE TO
665,00:28:10.88,00:28:10.88,DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE TRIBE.
666,00:28:12.83,00:28:12.83,THANK YOU.

673,00:28:30.25,00:28:30.25,WE LOSE AS A TEAM.
674,00:28:31.21,00:28:31.21,IT SUCKS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT
675,00:28:33.29,00:28:33.29,"WE HAVE TO DO NOW, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE GAME."
676,00:28:34.92,00:28:34.92,>> THAT'S RIGHT.
677,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,>> IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF US.
678,00:28:37.17,00:28:37.17,">> COOL, LET'S GET TO WORK."

694,00:29:25.04,00:29:25.04,BECAUSE I'M A STRONG MAN.
695,00:29:28.88,00:29:28.88,"AND IF IT'S TO BE REDEMPTION, I KIND OF LIKE THAT NAME."
696,00:29:34.21,00:29:34.21,>> TONIGHT I'M PLAYING THE IDOL.
697,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
698,00:29:37.88,00:29:37.88,THEY STILL HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO VOTE OFF WHOEVER THEY WANT.
699,00:29:39.75,00:29:39.75,SO THEY'RE NO WAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND LET
700,00:29:42.21,00:29:42.21,ME SLIP BAY AGAIN SO I'M PLAYING
701,00:29:44.00,00:29:44.00,"IT FOR SURE, WHICH IS REALLY SAD."

704,00:29:58.00,00:29:58.00,MATT AND ANDREA THAT THEY'LL STAY WITH US?
705,00:30:00.96,00:30:00.96,>> ANDREA IS DECENT IN CHALLENGES.
706,00:30:03.38,00:30:03.38,"LIKE, SHE'S A STRENGTH, I FEEL LIKE."
707,00:30:05.46,00:30:05.46,">> I'M TELLING YOU, MAN--"

711,00:30:13.00,00:30:13.00,IT'S CRAZY. IT'S CRAZY.
712,00:30:15.79,00:30:15.79,BUT THIS IS SUCH A WEIRD SPOT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW.
713,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,THEY'LL NEVER EXPECT FOUR OF US TO VOTE FOR MATT.
714,00:30:21.75,00:30:21.75,"I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR MATT, BUT, HONESTLY, HIM GOING OVER TO"
715,00:30:25.04,00:30:25.04,"THE OTHER TRIBE, IT MAKES ME SICK."

718,00:30:29.21,00:30:29.21,>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SEE
719,00:30:30.67,00:30:30.67,WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT OF A CHALLENGE YOU LOST
720,00:30:33.12,00:30:33.12,YOUR TEAMMATE GOING OVER AND SHAKING HANDS.
721,00:30:35.08,00:30:35.08,I DON'T KNOW.
722,00:30:36.79,00:30:36.79,THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE FOR
723,00:30:38.71,00:30:38.71,"THOSE THINGS, AND THAT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE TIMES."
724,00:30:40.54,00:30:40.54,WE JUST ALL FOUR FOR MATT?
725,00:30:42.54,00:30:42.54,>> FOUR OF US VOTE FOR MATT AND THAT'S IT.
726,00:30:45.12,00:30:45.12,BUT WE TELL MATT AND ANDREA WE'RE SPLITTING VOTES.
727,00:30:48.83,00:30:48.83,AND THEN WE'LL FIND OUT IF THEY WERE FIGURING TO SCREW US.
728,00:30:52.08,00:30:52.08,WE'LL SEE WHEN THE VOTES COME THROUGH.
729,00:30:53.58,00:30:53.58,>> RIGHT.
730,00:30:54.58,00:30:54.58,>> YOU KNOW?
731,00:30:55.79,00:30:55.79,I DON'T REALLY WANT TO VOTE MATT OUT.
732,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,"I LIKE HIM, BUT, HEY, IT HAPPENS."
733,00:30:58.83,00:30:58.83,>> THE FIRST GAME PLAN WAS TO VOTE OUT PHILLIP OR ANDREA.
734,00:31:01.79,00:31:01.79,"WELL, MATT'S GETTING FOUR VOTES."
735,00:31:03.58,00:31:03.58,"I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ""SURVIVOR"" LIKE THIS."
736,00:31:06.00,00:31:06.00,I REALLY DIDN'T.
737,00:31:07.38,00:31:07.38,I WANTED TO KEEP MY TEAM STRONG.
738,00:31:09.12,00:31:09.12,"I MEAN, I GET IT."

744,00:31:31.00,00:31:31.00,SO HOW DO WE WANT TO DO IT?
745,00:31:32.29,00:31:32.29,>> LET'S JUST SPLIT IT. >> LET'S JUST SPLIT IT.
746,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,>> KEEP IT SIMPLE.

752,00:31:50.08,00:31:50.08,DONE.

754,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,ARE CONCERNED WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT VOTES 3-3.
755,00:31:56.67,00:31:56.67,THE GIRLS ARE ALL VOTING FOR CHRISTINE.

766,00:32:33.92,00:32:33.92,>> ALL RIGHT.
767,00:32:35.42,00:32:35.42,YOU LET ME KNOW.
768,00:32:40.46,00:32:40.46,>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE PLAY.
769,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,HE HAS NOWHERE TO GO.

776,00:33:10.62,00:33:10.62,AND PLAY THIS GAME AND SEE WHAT THEY NEED AND FULFILL THAT NEED.
777,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
778,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,>> SO THE WHEELS ARE IN MOTION FOR EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN.
779,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN THE WAY IT SHOULD HAPPEN.

781,00:33:28.75,00:33:28.75,"WE HAVEN'T DECIDED, BUT NO MATTER WHO IT IS,"
782,00:33:31.25,00:33:31.25,"I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE."
783,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,">> OKAY I'LL TAKE YOU ON YOUR WORD, MAN."

789,00:33:43.79,00:33:43.79,I HAVE NO REASON TO.
790,00:33:45.08,00:33:45.08,PHILLIP'S A TOUGH COOKIE.
791,00:33:47.71,00:33:47.71,I LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL
792,00:33:50.12,00:33:50.12,ONE MINUTE BEFORE WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
793,00:33:52.42,00:33:52.42,I MAY ACTUALLY EVEN HAVE TO TELL HIM AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
794,00:33:55.25,00:33:55.25,WHO TO VOTE FOR BECAUSE PHILLIP LIKES TO TALK A LOT.
795,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,HE'S LIABLE TO RUN AROUND AND
796,00:34:02.21,00:34:02.21,TELL EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING.
797,00:34:04.88,00:34:04.88,THE PLAN IS BIGGER THAN JUST TONIGHT.
798,00:34:07.29,00:34:07.29,SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
799,00:34:08.92,00:34:08.92,"WHEN THE TIME COMES TO VOTE, I'M GONNA TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUT"
800,00:34:12.54,00:34:12.54,IT ON THE SHOULDER OF THE PERSON I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR.
801,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,OKAY?
802,00:34:16.04,00:34:16.04,>> OKAY.
803,00:34:17.21,00:34:17.21,>> BUT YOU NEED TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING HOME.
804,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,>> OKAY.

808,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,>> RIGHT.
809,00:34:28.58,00:34:28.58,">> KIND OF LIKE-- YOU'RE AN ACTOR, BRO."

815,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,THIS WILL BE A GOOD TEST TO SEE
816,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,IF PHILLIP DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO.
817,00:34:45.08,00:34:45.08,"AND IF HE DOES, HE CAN START TO"
818,00:34:47.38,00:34:47.38,EARN HIS WAY BACK INTO THE ROTATION.

820,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,"WHAT I TOLD HIM, PHILLIP WILL BE SENT PACKING."

837,00:35:50.25,00:35:50.25,AND YOU SAID ABSOLUTELY.
838,00:35:51.88,00:35:51.88,>> THE GORILLA.
839,00:35:53.25,00:35:53.25,A POWERFUL ANIMAL.
840,00:35:54.71,00:35:54.71,WON'T ATTACK UNLESS PROVOKED.
841,00:35:57.75,00:35:57.75,"THE LION, ONE OF THE FEW"
842,00:36:00.75,00:36:00.75,"ANIMALS THAT NO ANIMAL,"

851,00:36:27.17,00:36:27.17,BECAUSE IT KIND OF DELIVERS.
852,00:36:29.29,00:36:29.29,"AND A GORILLA THEY EITHER GET BEAT DOWN BY ANOTHER SILVERBACK,"
853,00:36:33.17,00:36:33.17,"BECAUSE IT'S SURVIVOR OF THE FITTEST, OR THEY DON'T LOSE,"
854,00:36:36.96,00:36:36.96,AND I LOST.
855,00:36:38.46,00:36:38.46,AND I NEED TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT LOSS.

860,00:36:49.08,00:36:49.08,HE TAKES IT VERY PERSONAL AND VERY HARD.
861,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I'M A COMPETITOR, TOO."
862,00:36:55.29,00:36:55.29,"AND I SAID, ""LOOK, WE WIN AS A TEAM."

864,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW HE FEELS.
865,00:37:00.88,00:37:00.88,"I'D INTERNALIZE IT AND I'D FEEL LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT, TOO."
866,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,">> Jeff: SO, MATT, YOU HAVE SOMEBODY NOW SAYING VOTE ME OUT."

872,00:37:17.79,00:37:17.79,VOTING SOMEONE OUT FOR A SINGLE MISTAKE.
873,00:37:20.17,00:37:20.17,"BUT IN THIS GAME, IT CAN HAPPEN"
874,00:37:22.96,00:37:22.96,"AS QUICKLY AS THAT, AND SO I'M"
875,00:37:24.50,00:37:24.50,JUST REALLY NOT SURE AT THIS POINT.
876,00:37:26.21,00:37:26.21,THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS VOTE FOR SOME REASON.
877,00:37:28.96,00:37:28.96,">> Jeff: PHILLIP, TO WORK SO HARD TO GET HERE, IT CAN'T BE"
878,00:37:33.04,00:37:33.04,EASY TO BE ON THE VERGE OF WALKING OUT OF HERE.

885,00:37:52.42,00:37:52.42,>> Jeff: YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD IF VOTED OUT TONIGHT
886,00:37:55.25,00:37:55.25,GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
887,00:37:56.62,00:37:56.62,>> I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO HAVE STAYED BUT THERE IS SOME UPSIDE.

892,00:38:10.88,00:38:10.88,ARE HOW MANY PEOPLE COME BACK FROM
