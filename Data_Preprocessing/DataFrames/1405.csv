48,00:02:34.92,00:02:34.92,the immunity idol definitelypoints to the fact that it's in
49,00:02:39.08,00:02:39.08,"our tribal camp area.In fact, it's very specific that"
50,00:02:44.88,00:02:44.88,"it is at the threshold of ourcave, where we are sleeping."
51,00:02:49.33,00:02:49.33,"It's very frustrating.I sort of know where it is, and"
52,00:02:51.92,00:02:51.92,I don't know how to get to it.>> Earl is the only other person

57,00:03:38.08,00:03:38.08,"only have a couple, but he'sgoing to need my help."

61,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,me just helping him get the idolis just a good move.
62,00:04:04.54,00:04:04.54,"( theme song playing )>> We're struggling right now,"
63,00:04:29.46,00:04:29.46,"and all of us are starving.The other camp, they have a"
64,00:04:33.96,00:04:33.96,"shelter, a king-sized mattress,tons of food, fishing gear."
65,00:04:38.50,00:04:38.50,We're still sleeping on palmfronds.
66,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,We at least got a good watersystem going.
67,00:04:44.62,00:04:44.62,And that's about it.>> Yau-Man and I had a little
68,00:04:50.75,00:04:50.75,"chat about the idol.I mean, he has an idea where it"
69,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,"might be, but there's no way forhim to look for it when people"
70,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,"are there, because the idol isactually in our little cave."
71,00:05:02.29,00:05:02.29,So we got to get people out ofthere.
72,00:05:05.58,00:05:05.58,"It's time to go hunting forcrab-- crab, snails, anything"
73,00:05:10.38,00:05:10.38,you see-- if you want to eat.>> I'm very excited.
74,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,"I got a chance to dig, I don'tknow for how long."
75,00:05:32.88,00:05:32.88,The problem is I don't know whenthey will show up.
76,00:05:37.12,00:05:37.12,"I know it's along the thresholdsomewhere, right at the entrance"
77,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,"of the cave.So logically, if that's true,"
78,00:05:43.08,00:05:43.08,then it would be rightunderneath here.
79,00:06:00.00,00:06:00.00,"The problem is the cluedefinitely says, ""Dig deep."""
80,00:06:05.42,00:06:05.42,"That's the question, how deep doI have to go?"
81,00:06:07.71,00:06:07.71,"And with a machete, it's noteasy to dig deep."
82,00:06:24.92,00:06:24.92,>> I took the whole camp out togive Yau a chance to dig for
83,00:06:27.38,00:06:27.38,"that immunity idol.Hopefully, he goes with what I'm"
84,00:06:31.04,00:06:31.04,"trying to do.Now, look at that."
85,00:06:38.25,00:06:38.25,That's what I'm talking about.>> Earl and I decided we were
86,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,"going to hike up, see if wecould find some more fruit or"
87,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,"anything edible.And I tell you, we got up to the"
88,00:06:52.42,00:06:52.42,"hill, where you can see 360degrees, all around the island."
89,00:06:58.00,00:06:58.00,We so rarely get a chance tojust take it in and just let
90,00:07:02.08,00:07:02.08,ourselves be astounded and awedby what's around us.
91,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,It gives you new drive to keepgoing.
92,00:07:10.33,00:07:10.33,"In a battle of wills, which thisgame is, you need every little"
93,00:07:13.88,00:07:13.88,ounce of energy you can get tokeep you just emotionally going
94,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,forward.>> The search for the immunity
95,00:07:30.54,00:07:30.54,idol is not going very well.Trying to dig with that machete
96,00:07:35.50,00:07:35.50,"is quite difficult-- to digdeep, at least."
97,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,"At this point, it's going to bevery difficult to get it."
98,00:07:57.08,00:07:57.08,">> Tree mail.>> Time to go get our reward,"

111,00:08:36.17,00:08:36.17,"Who cares how much luxury?We have so much luxury, it"
112,00:08:38.46,00:08:38.46,doesn't matter.>> I want the chocolate cake.
113,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,Can we please pick one thingthat we need and one thing we
114,00:08:47.33,00:08:47.33,"want?>> Yeah, one thing that we need"
