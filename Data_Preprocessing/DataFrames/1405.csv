21,00:00:51.04,00:00:51.04,"What do you mean, ""What happened?"""
22,00:00:52.67,00:00:52.67,">> PROBST: Yau-Man was sent to Exile Island, where he learned"

36,00:01:32.04,00:01:32.04,between giving up immunity or their camp of comfort.
37,00:01:35.33,00:01:35.33,">> Jeff, we're keeping our comfort and going to tribal"

39,00:01:40.04,00:01:40.04,alliance of five solidified. >> We need to put in our votes

42,00:01:48.04,00:01:48.04,Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji...
43,00:01:50.42,00:01:50.42,>> Wow. >> PROBST: ...Liliana was blind-
44,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,"sided. Liliana, the tribe has spoken."
45,00:01:56.25,00:01:56.25,14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
46,00:02:22.08,00:02:22.08,">> You guys like it well-done, right?"
47,00:02:26.50,00:02:26.50,"Medium-well, all right. I just came back from Exile"
48,00:02:30.38,00:02:30.38,Island. The clues to the whereabouts of
49,00:02:34.92,00:02:34.92,the immunity idol definitely points to the fact that it's in
50,00:02:39.08,00:02:39.08,"our tribal camp area. In fact, it's very specific that"
51,00:02:44.88,00:02:44.88,"it is at the threshold of our cave, where we are sleeping."
52,00:02:49.33,00:02:49.33,"It's very frustrating. I sort of know where it is, and"
53,00:02:51.92,00:02:51.92,I don't know how to get to it. >> Earl is the only other person
54,00:02:57.33,00:02:57.33,who has been to Exile Island. >> He knows that I know where it
55,00:03:19.04,00:03:19.04,"is sort of, and I know he knows sort of where it is."
56,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,"So maybe at some point, we can join forces in finding this"
57,00:03:25.79,00:03:25.79,"idol. >> He has all the clues, and I"
58,00:03:38.08,00:03:38.08,"only have a couple, but he's going to need my help."
59,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50,>> I like Yau. I just want to build that trust
60,00:03:47.92,00:03:47.92,"with him, okay? ""Yau, you can trust me."
61,00:03:50.12,00:03:50.12,"I have your back."" Just when it comes down to it,"
62,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,me just helping him get the idol is just a good move.
63,00:04:04.54,00:04:04.54,"( theme song playing ) >> We're struggling right now,"
64,00:04:29.46,00:04:29.46,"and all of us are starving. The other camp, they have a"
65,00:04:33.96,00:04:33.96,"shelter, a king-sized mattress, tons of food, fishing gear."
66,00:04:38.50,00:04:38.50,We're still sleeping on palm fronds.
67,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,We at least got a good water system going.
68,00:04:44.62,00:04:44.62,And that's about it. >> Yau-Man and I had a little
69,00:04:50.75,00:04:50.75,"chat about the idol. I mean, he has an idea where it"
70,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,"might be, but there's no way for him to look for it when people"
71,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,"are there, because the idol is actually in our little cave."
72,00:05:02.29,00:05:02.29,So we got to get people out of there.
73,00:05:05.58,00:05:05.58,"It's time to go hunting for crab-- crab, snails, anything"
74,00:05:10.38,00:05:10.38,you see-- if you want to eat. >> I'm very excited.
75,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,"I got a chance to dig, I don't know for how long."
76,00:05:32.88,00:05:32.88,The problem is I don't know when they will show up.
77,00:05:37.12,00:05:37.12,"I know it's along the threshold somewhere, right at the entrance"
78,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,"of the cave. So logically, if that's true,"
79,00:05:43.08,00:05:43.08,then it would be right underneath here.
80,00:06:00.00,00:06:00.00,"The problem is the clue definitely says, ""Dig deep."""
81,00:06:05.42,00:06:05.42,"That's the question, how deep do I have to go?"
82,00:06:07.71,00:06:07.71,"And with a machete, it's not easy to dig deep."
83,00:06:24.92,00:06:24.92,>> I took the whole camp out to give Yau a chance to dig for
84,00:06:27.38,00:06:27.38,"that immunity idol. Hopefully, he goes with what I'm"
85,00:06:31.04,00:06:31.04,"trying to do. Now, look at that."
86,00:06:38.25,00:06:38.25,That's what I'm talking about. >> Earl and I decided we were
87,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,"going to hike up, see if we could find some more fruit or"
88,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,"anything edible. And I tell you, we got up to the"
89,00:06:52.42,00:06:52.42,"hill, where you can see 360 degrees, all around the island."
90,00:06:58.00,00:06:58.00,We so rarely get a chance to just take it in and just let
91,00:07:02.08,00:07:02.08,ourselves be astounded and awed by what's around us.
92,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,It gives you new drive to keep going.
93,00:07:10.33,00:07:10.33,"In a battle of wills, which this game is, you need every little"
94,00:07:13.88,00:07:13.88,ounce of energy you can get to keep you just emotionally going
95,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,forward. >> The search for the immunity
96,00:07:30.54,00:07:30.54,idol is not going very well. Trying to dig with that machete
97,00:07:35.50,00:07:35.50,"is quite difficult-- to dig deep, at least."
98,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,"At this point, it's going to be very difficult to get it."
99,00:07:57.08,00:07:57.08,">> Tree mail. >> Time to go get our reward,"
100,00:08:00.21,00:08:00.21,establish our new victory streak.
101,00:08:04.04,00:08:04.04,">> Oh, pictures. >> ""Pick two choices for your"
102,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,"reward. You win, you'll take it all."
103,00:08:09.92,00:08:09.92,"If you lose, you'll just take a beating."""
104,00:08:12.62,00:08:12.62,"Toiletries-- I saw toiletries! >> Wine, cheese."
105,00:08:16.38,00:08:16.38,">> Oh, yeah, that one! >> Oh!"
106,00:08:19.29,00:08:19.29,>> I say we get the cake and the toiletries.
107,00:08:23.25,00:08:23.25,>> The toiletries. >> Are you going to change your
108,00:08:25.04,00:08:25.04,"vote? >> We keep getting more food,"
109,00:08:27.08,00:08:27.08,more nourishment. Ravu keeps getting less.
110,00:08:30.12,00:08:30.12,They're wasting away. But we have the luxury of them
111,00:08:32.29,00:08:32.29,being down and malnourished and us being fat and happy.
112,00:08:36.17,00:08:36.17,"Who cares how much luxury? We have so much luxury, it"
113,00:08:38.46,00:08:38.46,doesn't matter. >> I want the chocolate cake.
114,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,Can we please pick one thing that we need and one thing we
115,00:08:47.33,00:08:47.33,"want? >> Yeah, one thing that we need"
116,00:08:49.25,00:08:49.25,"and something we can eat. >> Two things we need, that'd be"
117,00:08:53.25,00:08:53.25,"the best thing, two things that we need."
118,00:08:56.08,00:08:56.08,">> I'm starving. >> Okay, we definitely want..."
119,00:08:59.58,00:08:59.58,"that's why we want fishing gear, to catch fish."
120,00:09:02.62,00:09:02.62,We're not on Fantasy Island. I don't want wine and cheese.
121,00:09:04.67,00:09:04.67,That doesn't do anything for me. Moto is living in a mansion over
122,00:09:07.25,00:09:07.25,"there, you know, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air over there."
123,00:09:09.46,00:09:09.46,"And we're like, you know, Good Times."
124,00:09:11.96,00:09:11.96,"You know, we're going to be practical."
125,00:09:13.54,00:09:13.54,They should have put a couple of Philly cheese steaks on there.
126,00:09:15.83,00:09:15.83,>> Don't start with the food game!
127,00:09:22.00,00:09:22.00,">> PROBST: Ravu, come on in! Moto, come on in!"
128,00:09:41.04,00:09:41.04,"Boo, can't help but notice that you're coming in here chewing"
129,00:09:43.67,00:09:43.67,"on... what was that, mango? >> Yes, sir."
130,00:09:46.21,00:09:46.21,">> PROBST: Rocky, it's got to burn a little bit."
131,00:09:48.58,00:09:48.58,">> I mean, look at my eyes. There's fire coming out right"
132,00:09:50.38,00:09:50.38,now. Laugh it up.
133,00:09:53.38,00:09:53.38,It's all right. We'll see what happens.
134,00:09:56.04,00:09:56.04,>> PROBST: Shall we get to today's challenge?
135,00:09:57.75,00:09:57.75,>> Yeah. >> Let's do it.
136,00:09:59.04,00:09:59.04,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, you will square off"
137,00:10:01.38,00:10:01.38,"one on one on a platform. Using large, padded bags, you"
138,00:10:06.38,00:10:06.38,will battle sumo-style. Your goal: knock the other tribe
139,00:10:10.71,00:10:10.71,"member off the platform, into the mud."
140,00:10:14.21,00:10:14.21,Winner scores a point for their tribe.
141,00:10:16.75,00:10:16.75,First tribe to seven wins reward.
142,00:10:19.25,00:10:19.25,The winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to
143,00:10:22.17,00:10:22.17,Exile Island. Let's get to the reward.
144,00:10:25.33,00:10:25.33,"Ravu, you chose necessity, the same fishing gear that Moto has"
145,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,"two sets of and a pot full of potatoes, absolute essentials if"
146,00:10:33.75,00:10:33.75,you guys are going to have any shot in this game.
147,00:10:36.21,00:10:36.21,"Life is so good for Moto, they chose more luxury: coffee and"
148,00:10:41.17,00:10:41.17,some toiletries. Winner takes it all.
149,00:10:47.21,00:10:47.21,">> Keep it up, Dreamz. Keep it up, guy, seriously."
150,00:10:50.25,00:10:50.25,Why don't me and you go up there right now?
151,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,>> We could. >> Let's do that then.
152,00:10:53.62,00:10:53.62,Keep running your mouth. Bring it.
153,00:10:55.08,00:10:55.08,"Bring it, bro. I'm sick of this guy."
154,00:10:57.04,00:10:57.04,"Let's go, Jeff. Let's play the game."
155,00:10:58.46,00:10:58.46,>> PROBST: Do we have our first match?
156,00:10:59.83,00:10:59.83,Is it Rocky and Dreamz? >> That's what it is.

191,00:13:13.62,00:13:13.62,( cheering ) >> PROBST: Moto leads six-zip.
192,00:13:19.96,00:13:19.96,We're down to the last two tribe members in this round.
193,00:13:23.71,00:13:23.71,We have Yau-Man now squaring off against Stacy.
194,00:13:26.25,00:13:26.25,>> Bulldoze him! >> PROBST: Moto leads six-zip.
195,00:13:29.21,00:13:29.21,"Stacy wins here, it's over. Survivors ready?"
196,00:13:34.67,00:13:34.67,"Go. >> Go, Stacy, go!"
197,00:13:39.46,00:13:39.46,"Go, Stacy, go! >> Push, Stacy, push!"
198,00:13:42.04,00:13:42.04,">> Come on, Stacy! ( cheering )"
199,00:13:50.08,00:13:50.08,>> PROBST: Stacy in the water! Ravu scores their first point.
200,00:13:55.54,00:13:55.54,">> That a boy, Yau. >> Yeah, Yau."
201,00:14:01.08,00:14:01.08,>> Do what you got to do. >> PROBST: Here's where we
202,00:14:07.08,00:14:07.08,"stand: Moto leads 6-1. This is a grudge match,"
203,00:14:11.62,00:14:11.62,Cassandra taking on Rita once again.
204,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17,Cassandra could win it for Moto right here.
205,00:14:16.62,00:14:16.62,Survivors ready? Go.
206,00:14:24.75,00:14:24.75,A hard push and a big fall for Rita.
207,00:14:28.38,00:14:28.38,"Moto wins reward! Moto, you will now send one"
208,00:14:35.25,00:14:35.25,person from the Ravu tribe to Exile Island.
209,00:14:38.08,00:14:38.08,Who's it going to be? >> Earl.
210,00:14:40.21,00:14:40.21,">> PROBST: Earl, you will return in time for the next immunity"
211,00:14:42.25,00:14:42.25,"challenge. Straight out this way, Earl."
212,00:14:48.88,00:14:48.88,"Ravu, once again I got nothing for you."
213,00:14:52.04,00:14:52.04,"Moto, congratulations on another win."
214,00:14:55.25,00:14:55.25,"Fishing gear, potatoes, toiletries, coffee, it's all"
215,00:14:58.17,00:14:58.17,yours. Head on back.
216,00:15:16.17,00:15:16.17,">> Oh, my god! I love coffee."
217,00:15:19.88,00:15:19.88,>> This is clean. I have not smelled anything
218,00:15:21.88,00:15:21.88,"clean in a long, long time. >> Let's make coffee."
219,00:15:24.75,00:15:24.75,Let's make coffee. Let's make coffee.
220,00:15:26.17,00:15:26.17,Let's make coffee now. >> Oh!
221,00:15:29.00,00:15:29.00,That challenge was a winner- take-all situation.
222,00:15:31.21,00:15:31.21,"Either we were going to get coffee, toiletries, bag of"
223,00:15:33.58,00:15:33.58,"potatoes, and yet again the fishing gear, or we were going"
224,00:15:36.88,00:15:36.88,to lose it all and potentially lose our advantage.
225,00:15:39.21,00:15:39.21,So it was a big deal. >> Coffee.
226,00:15:42.17,00:15:42.17,"Aw, they even gave us floss. That's all right."
227,00:15:48.33,00:15:48.33,Y'all ain't got to talk to me. It's cool.
228,00:15:50.88,00:15:50.88,>> Dreamz and Cassandra have no allies on this team.
229,00:15:53.92,00:15:53.92,It's 5-2. They're going to get picked off.
230,00:15:55.54,00:15:55.54,They know it. They're getting paranoid.
231,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,It's not my problem. We're all adults here.
232,00:15:59.50,00:15:59.50,"There's no children. I mean, come on."
233,00:16:01.54,00:16:01.54,It's Survivor. >> This ain't the instant
234,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,dissolve coffee. It's one you got to filter.
235,00:16:12.12,00:16:12.12,But it's so good. ( spitting )
236,00:16:17.33,00:16:17.33,">> What's going on, Boo... I mean Dreamz?"
237,00:16:19.58,00:16:19.58,You put the boiling water in there with the coffee.
238,00:16:22.62,00:16:22.62,"Yeah, you don't.... >> Do you know how to make it,"
239,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,"man? >> Well, if you guys know how to"
240,00:16:32.46,00:16:32.46,"make it, tell him how to make it."
241,00:16:34.50,00:16:34.50,">> That's cool. Y'all can say that to my face,"
242,00:16:39.92,00:16:39.92,"you know, whatever y'all are saying back there."
243,00:16:44.08,00:16:44.08,">> Stacy and Lisi I think, in particular, are just downright"
244,00:16:46.12,00:16:46.12,rude. It kind of nauseates me to see
245,00:16:48.71,00:16:48.71,people being treated that way. It really kind of just rubbed me
246,00:16:51.21,00:16:51.21,"the wrong way. Well, I don't know how to"
247,00:16:53.29,00:16:53.29,"freaking use it, so if someone can tell me..."
248,00:16:54.88,00:16:54.88,>> You have to boil water. You put the coffee in the
249,00:16:56.50,00:16:56.50,"bottom, you pour the boiling water on top, and you let it sit"
250,00:16:59.25,00:16:59.25,"for about three minute, and then you press it down, and then you"
251,00:17:01.62,00:17:01.62,"have coffee, simple as that. >> This game to me is about"
252,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,"almost immediate karma, and why they would treat other human"
253,00:17:10.79,00:17:10.79,"beings that way just as human beings, and in the course of the"
254,00:17:13.58,00:17:13.58,"game, why they wouldn't see how that might screw them in the"
255,00:17:15.92,00:17:15.92,"future. >> Oh, my God, this is like a"
256,00:17:23.04,00:17:23.04,little piece of heaven. >> I'm really upset at Stacy and
257,00:17:36.79,00:17:36.79,"Lisi, because they're on a power trip, and if they're in my"
258,00:17:40.71,00:17:40.71,"alliance and they keep going that way, I'm going to make sure"
259,00:17:42.92,00:17:42.92,"they're out. >> This is, like, the best day"
260,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,"so far. >> Oh, yeah."
261,00:17:54.42,00:17:54.42,">> Yau's been to Exile Island, so him and I have an"
262,00:17:57.38,00:17:57.38,understanding. I gave him this opportunity to
263,00:18:00.38,00:18:00.38,actually look for the idol when I took everybody on the
264,00:18:03.17,00:18:03.17,"excursion, and he says he couldn't find it."
265,00:18:07.71,00:18:07.71,">> Clue number five: ""Under the entrance, under the ground,"
266,00:18:11.21,00:18:11.21,"right where you're living, the idol is found."""
267,00:18:14.04,00:18:14.04,I know that already. I trust Yau.
268,00:18:17.21,00:18:17.21,It pretty much just came down to not having the right tools.
269,00:18:20.88,00:18:20.88,"I don't think he'll find it before I get back, but you never"
270,00:18:23.71,00:18:23.71,know. >> Sorry I didn't have the sumo
271,00:18:35.96,00:18:35.96,"technique down, but it's not my forte, you know?"
272,00:18:41.04,00:18:41.04,The only sumo I watched was... was what's it called?
273,00:18:46.00,00:18:46.00,"Austin Powers, Fat Bastard. >> Isn't it funny that we're"
274,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,both really into fashion? >> I know.
275,00:18:54.29,00:18:54.29,"And for me, truthfully, I go out, I'm just lip gloss, good to"
276,00:18:56.62,00:18:56.62,go. Because if I have to... on top
277,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,"of that, when I go and work, have to put all that stuff on, I"
278,00:19:01.96,00:19:01.96,"don't want to put that on. I mean, models walk around like"
279,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,"this all day. I know for myself, my daily"
280,00:19:07.58,00:19:07.58,makeup routine is lip gloss and I'm out.
281,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,And of course we fare better because we're... our ethnic skin
282,00:19:15.00,00:19:15.00,"is really on our side. >> The whole lip-gloss thing,"
283,00:19:18.04,00:19:18.04,girl thing is really not my thing.
284,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,"Basically, I want to take my T-shirt and hang myself from a"
285,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33,"palm tree. >> So he's like, ""Rita, why"
286,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,don't we go out tomorrow for lunch?
287,00:19:26.96,00:19:26.96,"Bring your friend."" >> My ears are oozing."
288,00:19:28.75,00:19:28.75,You see this? That's the brain coming out.
289,00:19:30.71,00:19:30.71,>> Let me say it to you like this.
290,00:19:32.08,00:19:32.08,"If we all had, like, a one- bedroom apart, there was four of"
291,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,"us in there, right?-- all right, let's say me and you woke up"
292,00:19:37.21,00:19:37.21,"earlier than everybody else all the time, and we had some things"
293,00:19:40.62,00:19:40.62,"we just had to talk about, you go out of the room."
294,00:19:44.12,00:19:44.12,All these conversations they have are absolutely stupid.
295,00:19:48.17,00:19:48.17,I want to smack them with a fried pineapple.
296,00:19:50.12,00:19:50.12,I don't know what to do. It's driving me absolutely
297,00:19:51.92,00:19:51.92,crazy. >> I'm one of those people that
298,00:19:53.88,00:19:53.88,"look high-maintenance, but I'm so low maintenance."
299,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,">> So I've done the math on this, right?"
300,00:20:04.38,00:20:04.38,>> Uh-huh. >> So let's assume we merge with
301,00:20:06.12,00:20:06.12,ten people. >> Uh-huh.
302,00:20:09.25,00:20:09.25,">> If we win every single immunity, we end up with us"
303,00:20:13.25,00:20:13.25,"seven, Ravu has three, Cassandra and Dreamz switch over, now it's"
304,00:20:17.96,00:20:17.96,"five and five voting-wise. >> Cool, whatever."
305,00:20:21.58,00:20:21.58,">> No, it's not cool, whatever. We don't have the majority"
306,00:20:23.29,00:20:23.29,"anymore. You know, for some reason, the"
307,00:20:25.21,00:20:25.21,whole situation with Dreamz and Cassandra had just... it had
308,00:20:28.04,00:20:28.04,"really been... sort of been eating away at me, and I started"
309,00:20:31.00,00:20:31.00,"to do a little bit of math. Do you see the obvious, like,"
310,00:20:33.38,00:20:33.38,issue we have here? >> We do not need to do business
311,00:20:37.21,00:20:37.21,"with them at all, seriously. I don't think we should include"
312,00:20:39.42,00:20:39.42,Dreamz and Cassandra on anything.
313,00:20:42.71,00:20:42.71,>> Excluding Cassandra and Dreamz is the dumbest thing we
314,00:20:45.83,00:20:45.83,"could do. If we don't keep them happy,"
315,00:20:47.71,00:20:47.71,they're going to flip-flop. Then we're all screwed.
316,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,">> Yeah, but we want them all gone."
317,00:21:03.21,00:21:03.21,">> Yeah, see, dude, but... Oh, God, kill me!"
318,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,Kill me! Kill me right now!
319,00:21:08.25,00:21:08.25,How do you not understand what I'm trying to say to you?
320,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,">> I had a little talk with Alex, and we're like, ""Listen,"
321,00:21:27.17,00:21:27.17,"if Stacy and Lisi are going to be like this, let's keep"
322,00:21:29.83,00:21:29.83,"Cassandra and Dreamz close."" >> Boo is so dumb too."
323,00:21:33.79,00:21:33.79,"Boo does whatever they say. >> They think because five,"
324,00:21:36.00,00:21:36.00,they're in control. They're not thinking further
325,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,ahead like you and me. So we're kind of the peace
326,00:21:40.96,00:21:40.96,keepers in this tribe right now. We're trying to put our chess
327,00:21:43.88,00:21:43.88,"pieces in place so when we start really playing the game, we have"
328,00:21:46.96,00:21:46.96,them at the right place at the right time.
329,00:21:48.75,00:21:48.75,">> Now, we're going to have our internal whatevers, but at the"
330,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"end of the day, we're a team, and the goal is to take Ravu out"
331,00:21:53.88,00:21:53.88,"and make it as far as we can, because we deserve every victory"
332,00:21:56.92,00:21:56.92,"we've earned. >> I came back to the shelter,"
333,00:21:59.50,00:21:59.50,and it was like they'd embraced me again.
334,00:22:01.38,00:22:01.38,It was like a warm embrace again.
335,00:22:03.17,00:22:03.17,It didn't change my strategy of what to do come the merge.
336,00:22:07.21,00:22:07.21,"When we get into the merge, me and Cassandra are going to leave"
337,00:22:11.04,00:22:11.04,and go with the other tribe. >> Let's just continue to
338,00:22:13.33,00:22:13.33,"battle, remember we're a team, and just bang it out, just bang"
339,00:22:15.88,00:22:15.88,"it out. >> Is that a solid solidarity,"
340,00:22:18.25,00:22:18.25,"guys? >> It's a solid solidarity,"
341,00:22:20.08,00:22:20.08,guys. >> Solid?
342,00:22:21.50,00:22:21.50,">> Everybody? >> That's a great plan,"
343,00:22:23.92,00:22:23.92,"genocide, genocide. Saying genocide and wiping out"
344,00:22:27.79,00:22:27.79,"Ravu, that's just part of the game now."
345,00:22:29.96,00:22:29.96,"It's like poker. You bluffing, acting like you"
346,00:22:31.92,00:22:31.92,got something when you don't. They're always talking about
347,00:22:34.17,00:22:34.17,"""Hey, it's a game; it's just strategy."""
348,00:22:36.12,00:22:36.12,So I'm going to just show them. I can't wait till the day to put
349,00:22:38.12,00:22:38.12,on my snakeskin boots to show them strategy.
350,00:22:54.00,00:22:54.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Earl"
351,00:23:07.21,00:23:07.21,"returning from Exile Island. >> Hey, Earl!"
352,00:23:10.29,00:23:10.29,>> What's going on? ( applause )
353,00:23:13.54,00:23:13.54,>> PROBST: Shall we get to today's immunity challenge?
354,00:23:16.00,00:23:16.00,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
355,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
356,00:23:27.75,00:23:27.75,"For today's challenge, your memory will be tested."
357,00:23:31.25,00:23:31.25,Scattered in the field are 30 boards.
358,00:23:34.46,00:23:34.46,Each board has a number or a word painted on it.
359,00:23:39.71,00:23:39.71,One tribe member at a time will reveal two boards.
360,00:23:43.50,00:23:43.50,"If the numbers or words match, you score a point for your"
361,00:23:45.71,00:23:45.71,tribe. First tribe to seven wins
362,00:23:48.25,00:23:48.25,"immunity, guaranteed at least one more day out here in Fiji."
363,00:23:52.96,00:23:52.96,"Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody going home."
364,00:23:56.17,00:23:56.17,"To make it a little more complicated, there are four"
365,00:23:58.75,00:23:58.75,dummy boards that do not have a match.
366,00:24:02.04,00:24:02.04,I'll give you a minute to strategize.
367,00:24:03.88,00:24:03.88,"We'll get started. Moto won the rock, paper,"
368,00:24:11.12,00:24:11.12,"scissor. Once you leave the platform,"
369,00:24:13.67,00:24:13.67,there is no coaching from your tribe.
370,00:24:16.88,00:24:16.88,Edgardo heads out for Moto. Edgardo flips over the seven.
371,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,Trying to use his ESP and flips over the priest-- no match.
372,00:24:34.96,00:24:34.96,Rocky heads out for Ravu. Rocky reveals the nine.
373,00:24:44.04,00:24:44.04,"Going somewhere new, hoping to get lucky."

375,00:24:49.67,00:24:49.67,Cassandra heads out for Moto. Cassandra would like to reveal
376,00:24:52.75,00:24:52.75,something that's already been shown.
377,00:24:55.12,00:24:55.12,"Cassandra reveals the eight, yet another new number."
378,00:25:01.12,00:25:01.12,Cassandra hoping to get lucky. Cassandra...
379,00:25:04.83,00:25:04.83,( cheering ) Cassandra lucks into a match.
380,00:25:09.96,00:25:09.96,Moto on the board with their first pair.
381,00:25:13.08,00:25:13.08,"Mookie would like the same kind of luck, walk into a match."
382,00:25:17.58,00:25:17.58,"Mookie flips over a ten. Mookie flips over the seven,"
383,00:25:26.25,00:25:26.25,"which excites Moto. Boo, he's jogging he's so"
384,00:25:34.04,00:25:34.04,excited. Boo flips over the first seven.
385,00:25:39.79,00:25:39.79,Does he remember where the second seven is?
386,00:25:46.12,00:25:46.12,Boo flips it over and has the second match for Moto.
387,00:25:50.21,00:25:50.21,Moto up two-zip. Rita heads out for Ravu.
388,00:25:55.58,00:25:55.58,"Rita flips over the 14. Once again, Ravu will need some"
389,00:25:59.17,00:25:59.17,luck. A three.
390,00:26:03.42,00:26:03.42,No score for Ravu. Stacy flips over a five.
391,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,And Stacy flips over the priest. Ravu very excited.
392,00:26:21.67,00:26:21.67,Yau-Man heading out on the course for Ravu.
393,00:26:27.21,00:26:27.21,Yau-Man reveals one priest. Can he remember where the second
394,00:26:31.42,00:26:31.42,"priest just was? Yau-Man surveying the course,"
395,00:26:41.42,00:26:41.42,"trying to remember, hasn't eaten much in a long time."
396,00:26:46.17,00:26:46.17,That sharp brain is a little soft.
397,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,No help. No need to look this way.
398,00:27:03.29,00:27:03.29,You're just going to tempt your tribe into losing a turn.
399,00:27:07.17,00:27:07.17,Yau-Man cannot ask his tribe for help.
400,00:27:10.04,00:27:10.04,"It's all on him. Yau-Man makes his selection, and"
401,00:27:18.71,00:27:18.71,"it is wrong. Yau-Man chooses princess, does"
402,00:27:23.25,00:27:23.25,not match up with priest. Chance for Ravu to get in this
403,00:27:27.04,00:27:27.04,game just slipped through their fingers.
404,00:27:30.21,00:27:30.21,Moto. Ooh!
405,00:27:35.88,00:27:35.88,Lisi so excited she takes a face plant.

407,00:27:47.04,00:27:47.04,"( tribe groans ) >> PROBST: No, no!"
408,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,"Lisi, back to the platform. Just to be clear, Lisi, you lost"
409,00:27:56.88,00:27:56.88,your turn because your tribe spoke.
410,00:27:59.12,00:27:59.12,You cannot do that. You lose a turn.
411,00:28:00.83,00:28:00.83,"Ravu's turn. >> Go, go."
412,00:28:02.88,00:28:02.88,">> You got it, you got it. >> PROBST: Big opportunity for"
413,00:28:04.92,00:28:04.92,Ravu. Will Ravu take back the
414,00:28:07.96,00:28:07.96,opportunity that Yau-Man lost? Earl lifts the first priest.
415,00:28:17.04,00:28:17.04,"Earl, very confident, flips the second priest."
416,00:28:20.58,00:28:20.58,Ravu on the board with their first point.
417,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,Dreamz reveals the number five. Dreamz trying to remember.
418,00:28:32.75,00:28:32.75,Where was the other five? Dreamz reveals the number ten.
419,00:28:41.17,00:28:41.17,"No match for Moto. >> Right here, the right of"
420,00:28:44.42,00:28:44.42,that. >> Right?
421,00:28:46.50,00:28:46.50,>> Right. >> PROBST: Anthony out on the
422,00:28:49.71,00:28:49.71,course for Ravu. Anthony could tie it up.
423,00:28:55.58,00:28:55.58,Anthony reveals a five. Looking to match up that five.
424,00:29:02.79,00:29:02.79,Is he right? He is.
425,00:29:07.25,00:29:07.25,( cheering ) >> PROBST: Anthony scores for
426,00:29:09.08,00:29:09.08,Ravu. We are tied 2-2.
427,00:29:15.21,00:29:15.21,( applause ) >> PROBST: Alex matches up the
428,00:29:17.08,00:29:17.08,three. Rocky on the board for Ravu.
429,00:29:20.79,00:29:20.79,>> What! >> PROBST: We remain tied.
430,00:29:24.04,00:29:24.04,Edgardo matches the two. ( applause )
431,00:29:27.54,00:29:27.54,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Ravu scores again.
432,00:29:30.12,00:29:30.12,"Stacy looking to match the ten, and she does."
433,00:29:33.33,00:29:33.33,Yau-Man looking for that match. Alex is looking to match up...
434,00:29:36.54,00:29:36.54,...tie this game back up. Alex scores another match.
435,00:29:40.79,00:29:40.79,"And we are tied 6-6. All right, it comes down to"
436,00:29:44.75,00:29:44.75,this. There is only one matching pair
437,00:29:48.21,00:29:48.21,left in the field. The rest are dummy boards.
438,00:29:51.17,00:29:51.17,So the tribe that matches that last pair wins immunity.
439,00:29:55.62,00:29:55.62,"Ravu, you're up. Michelle could win it for Ravu"
440,00:30:00.96,00:30:00.96,right here. Michelle flips over the 13.
441,00:30:09.33,00:30:09.33,"If she matches the 13, Ravu wins their first challenge."
442,00:30:14.33,00:30:14.33,( groaning ) She does not.
443,00:30:21.12,00:30:21.12,Edgardo heads out for Moto. He could win it for Moto.
444,00:30:28.38,00:30:28.38,"Edgardo flips the 12. If he flips the 12, Moto wins."
445,00:30:38.25,00:30:38.25,"Edgardo flips the nine, does not match."
446,00:30:43.58,00:30:43.58,Ravu again with an opportunity. >> Tell me where to go.

448,00:30:49.67,00:30:49.67,something. >> Okay.

450,00:30:58.12,00:30:58.12,>> PROBST: Rocky heading out for Ravu.
451,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,Ravu could win it if Rocky can match up two symbols.
452,00:31:04.58,00:31:04.58,He quickly flips the nine. ( Rocky laughs )
453,00:31:14.12,00:31:14.12,Only a few boards left to reveal.
454,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,"If Rocky matches the nine, Ravu wins their first challenge."
455,00:31:37.71,00:31:37.71,"Rocky flips over the 12, no match for Ravu."
456,00:31:42.25,00:31:42.25,Ravu squanders a huge opportunity and opens the door
457,00:31:45.92,00:31:45.92,for Moto to continue their winning streak.
458,00:31:50.21,00:31:50.21,Cassandra reveals the nine. Cassandra could win it right
459,00:31:57.21,00:31:57.21,here. ( cheering )
460,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,>> PROBST: Cassandra reveals the nine.
461,00:32:03.08,00:32:03.08,"Moto wins immunity, remains undefeated."
462,00:32:10.62,00:32:10.62,">> Argh! >> PROBST: Moto,"
463,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,congratulations. >> Thank you.

465,00:32:19.12,00:32:19.12,"safe from tribal council. Ravu, very close, just couldn't"
466,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,pull it together when you needed to.
467,00:32:27.04,00:32:27.04,We have a date tonight at tribal.
468,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,Somebody from this tribe is going home.
469,00:32:30.38,00:32:30.38,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
470,00:32:54.46,00:32:54.46,">> Yo, can I say something real quick or no?"
471,00:32:56.38,00:32:56.38,"I'm going to take the majority of the blame today, okay?"
472,00:32:59.04,00:32:59.04,"Because you know, it was up to me at the end."
473,00:33:01.25,00:33:01.25,"And between all the talk... like, just I had a mental"
474,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,"breakdown. You know, I didn't even know"
475,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,"what number we were going for, to be honest with you."
476,00:33:07.42,00:33:07.42,So I dropped the ball. I want to apologize for that.
477,00:33:10.42,00:33:10.42,"But at the same time, this mass confusion thing, everyone"
478,00:33:13.71,00:33:13.71,"talking at the same time, everyone going ( gibbering )"
479,00:33:16.88,00:33:16.88,"like that, like, in our dire straits right now, mentally, how"
480,00:33:20.58,00:33:20.58,can anybody like... >> Concentrate.
481,00:33:22.08,00:33:22.08,>> ...concentrate or comprehend absolutely anything?
482,00:33:25.25,00:33:25.25,">> People have to listen and know when to be quiet, like..."
483,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,>> It's not like I'm yelling at anybody.

485,00:33:31.04,00:33:31.04,has to really put the brakes on and know when to step back and
486,00:33:37.12,00:33:37.12,"be quiet, because... >> Let me ask you a question."
487,00:33:39.21,00:33:39.21,"When we were winning, when we were this close, is that the"
488,00:33:41.54,00:33:41.54,best you've felt since you've been here?
489,00:33:44.17,00:33:44.17,That's the best I've felt in 14 days.
490,00:33:49.75,00:33:49.75,>> Getting rid of Rocky would probably get rid of a lot of the
491,00:33:52.17,00:33:52.17,friction in the tribe. If you lay your cards on the
492,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,"like that at this point, when people are looking for anything,"
493,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"absolutely anything to get rid of somebody, don't be surprised"
494,00:34:02.17,00:34:02.17,if people follow up on it. >> Rita is running her mouth all
495,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,"day, guys. All she does is run her mouth."
496,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,"All through the challenge, that's all she was doing."
497,00:34:09.58,00:34:09.58,">> ""It's over here! It's over here!"
498,00:34:10.92,00:34:10.92,"It's over here!"" A lot of us have been looking at"
499,00:34:12.42,00:34:12.42,Rita. Some folks are really sick of
500,00:34:14.88,00:34:14.88,"hearing from Rita. Around the last vote, my head"
501,00:34:19.25,00:34:19.25,"was on the chopping block, but I'm going to keep my ears open"
502,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,"and hope nobody tries to flip the script on me, because right"
503,00:34:24.54,00:34:24.54,now this is still anybody's vote.
504,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,">> Oh, my God. >> What do you want to do"

509,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,"All right, it's done. >> Yup, we got our majority"
510,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,"right there, so just let Rocky know, okay?"
511,00:35:20.33,00:35:20.33,">> Yeah, I'm coming. >> That mouth of hers, it drives"

520,00:35:47.12,00:35:47.12,"Like, I don't know what's up with your boy Anthony."
521,00:35:48.71,00:35:48.71,You know him better than me. I don't know if he's being shady
522,00:35:50.88,00:35:50.88,or whatever. So I need you my side.
523,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,">> Usually I'm the person that brings up strategy, like, ""Well,"

525,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,devise their own plans. I think before they were just
526,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,"going with the majority, but it seems like everyone's doing"
527,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"their own thing, trying to play their own game now."
528,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,"You have to watch your back. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, you were so"
529,00:36:34.42,00:36:34.42,close. How frustrating is it?
530,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,">> It's very frustrating, and for me, personally, it was very"
531,00:36:43.42,00:36:43.42,embarrassing. My brains went into neutral when
532,00:36:46.75,00:36:46.75,"it came to my turn, and I couldn't remember something I"
533,00:36:49.21,00:36:49.21,saw 30 seconds ago. I hope it's a temporary
534,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"condition, because otherwise I'm in bad shape."

539,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,and it wasn't completely his fault.
540,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,"We all jumped in, and we all told him where we thought things"
541,00:37:11.00,00:37:11.00,"were, and you know, we confused him."

546,00:37:24.42,00:37:24.42,"and I felt bad. >> PROBST: Rita, you're going"
547,00:37:27.17,00:37:27.17,through something very extreme. When you get tired of thinking
548,00:37:30.71,00:37:30.71,"how bad things are, what do you talk about to get your mind off"
549,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,"of things? >> Well, I tell little stories"
550,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,that I think might be interesting to keep their mind
551,00:37:39.21,00:37:39.21,off this dire situation that we're in and try to keep
552,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,"everybody entertained. >> PROBST: Earl, are we at a"

556,00:37:56.17,00:37:56.17,the decisions were pretty quick. But I think now people are
557,00:37:59.12,00:37:59.12,starting to get to know one another.
558,00:38:01.21,00:38:01.21,I think it's about the chemistry.

562,00:38:14.62,00:38:14.62,none. So the question is what is few?
563,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,Whether I trust them depends on whether my strategy dovetails
564,00:38:20.42,00:38:20.42,"with theirs or not. >> PROBST: Anthony, as we get"
565,00:38:24.88,00:38:24.88,"ready to go to the vote, how uncomfortable are you that it"
566,00:38:28.38,00:38:28.38,might be you? >> Fairly uncomfortable.
567,00:38:30.42,00:38:30.42,"I mean, my personality does clash with some people, and they"
568,00:38:32.96,00:38:32.96,may think that I'm trying something when I'm trying to
569,00:38:35.42,00:38:35.42,bring as much honesty to people as I can.
570,00:38:39.04,00:38:39.04,">> PROBST: Okay, if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you"
571,00:38:43.79,00:38:43.79,"want to play it, you would present it to me after the votes"
572,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,have been cast but before I read them.
573,00:38:48.75,00:38:48.75,"It is time to vote. Earl, you're up."
574,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,">> As you know, this tribe works from majorities, and at this"
575,00:39:07.83,00:39:07.83,"point, I couldn't go against them."
576,00:39:21.29,00:39:21.29,">> We had our differences, but I like you a lot."
577,00:39:23.54,00:39:23.54,Good luck. >> It comes down to who is the
578,00:39:38.42,00:39:38.42,"most disposable. Sorry, nothing personal."
579,00:39:49.12,00:39:49.12,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
580,00:40:01.00,00:40:01.00,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
581,00:40:03.12,00:40:03.12,"play it, now is the time to do so."
582,00:40:09.25,00:40:09.25,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
583,00:40:12.04,00:40:12.04,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
584,00:40:13.92,00:40:13.92,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
585,00:40:17.58,00:40:17.58,"First vote, Anthony. Rita."
586,00:40:26.17,00:40:26.17,One vote Rita. Anthony.
587,00:40:31.62,00:40:31.62,Two votes Anthony. Rita.
588,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,"Two votes Anthony, two votes Rita."
589,00:40:42.88,00:40:42.88,"Rita. That's three votes Rita, two"
590,00:40:45.17,00:40:45.17,votes Anthony. Fifth person voted out of
591,00:40:51.58,00:40:51.58,"Survivor: Fiji, Rita. That's four, that's enough."
592,00:40:55.21,00:40:55.21,"You need to bring me your torch. Rita, the tribe has spoken."
593,00:41:10.04,00:41:10.04,It's time for you to go. >> Thank you.
594,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"Good luck. >> PROBST: Well, the good news"
595,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,is today's challenge showed you still have the will to win.
596,00:41:27.25,00:41:27.25,That will is what you got to hang on to tomorrow morning when
597,00:41:29.79,00:41:29.79,you get up to start another day. Grab your torches.
598,00:41:32.17,00:41:32.17,Head back to camp. Good night.
599,00:41:48.12,00:41:48.12,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
600,00:41:54.71,00:41:54.71,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
601,00:41:56.92,00:41:56.92,Drop your buffs. >> What?
602,00:41:58.50,00:41:58.50,">> ...a major shake-up... >> Come on, Dreamz."
603,00:42:00.12,00:42:00.12,>> PROBST: Maybe the biggest rivalry thus far just paired up.
604,00:42:02.75,00:42:02.75,...changes everything. >> Right now we're a super
605,00:42:04.54,00:42:04.54,power. >> PROBST: One very big decision
606,00:42:06.04,00:42:06.04,left to make. Which group is going to live on
607,00:42:09.04,00:42:09.04,the Moto beach and which group is going to Ravu?
608,00:42:19.58,00:42:19.58,">> I'm really surprised, and I'm sad at the result tonight, but I"
609,00:42:23.04,00:42:23.04,understand it's a game. I really tried to stay true and
610,00:42:26.00,00:42:26.00,"honest, and I did trust my alliances."
611,00:42:28.88,00:42:28.88,So maybe I was just too nice to play the game.
612,00:42:31.38,00:42:31.38,"But if that's the case, I leave this game feeling very proud."
613,00:42:34.71,00:42:34.71,"I just hope that I have made my kids proud, because that's main"
614,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,reason that I did this.
