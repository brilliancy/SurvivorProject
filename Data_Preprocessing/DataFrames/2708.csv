195,00:12:27.90,00:12:27.90,I WAS OUT ON REDEMPTION ISLAND FOR 12 DAYS THINKING ABOUT THIS
196,00:12:30.67,00:12:30.67,CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE. IT'S JUST TOUGH TO END THIS WAY.
197,00:12:32.90,00:12:32.90,>> Jeff: CAN YOU COMPARE THIS TO SOME OF THE TOUGH THINGS
198,00:12:38.47,00:12:38.47,"PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE THINGS I HAD TO GO THROUGH MY"

204,00:12:58.27,00:12:58.27,DAYS IN REDEMPTION ISLAND. THIS WAS A LOT HARDER THAN I
205,00:13:00.83,00:13:00.83,"THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. >> Jeff: JOHN, AFTER 19 DAYS--"
206,00:13:03.27,00:13:03.27,I KNOW IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT-- YOUR TIME IN THIS GAME IS OVER.

222,00:14:08.37,00:14:08.37,TOSSED RIGHT IN THE FIRE. BUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE NOW
223,00:14:12.00,00:14:12.00,"MERGED, MAYBE THIS HAS MORE VALUE."
224,00:14:14.30,00:14:14.30,"BEFORE YOU DECIDE ANYTHING, YOU CAN GIVE THIS TO ANYBODY YOU"
225,00:14:16.93,00:14:16.93,WANT WHO IS STILL IN THE GAME. THAT NOW INCLUDES YOU.
226,00:14:22.93,00:14:22.93,I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS GOING TO JOIN THE OTHERS IN THE FIRE.

246,00:16:04.70,00:16:04.70,CIERA OR IS LAURA M. GOING TO PULL CIERA.
247,00:16:09.77,00:16:09.77,"LAURA M., KATIE, AND IT COULD HINGE ON LAURA."
248,00:16:16.40,00:16:16.40,"ONCE THE MERGE HAMS, THIS IS WHEN THE GAME STARTS."
249,00:16:18.93,00:16:18.93,THIS IS WHERE SURVIVOR REALLY BECOMES SURVIVOR.

254,00:16:35.00,00:16:35.00,GET TO PLAY WITH MY DAUGHTER. MY PLAN IS US COUPLES HAVE TO
255,00:16:38.57,00:16:38.57,STAY TOGETHER. THAT'S SIX RIGHT THERE.
256,00:16:40.10,00:16:40.10,I DEFINITELY DO NEED TO TALK TO CIERA.
257,00:16:42.23,00:16:42.23,"I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO, A LOT OF WORK TO DO, BUT I'M STILL"
258,00:16:45.20,00:16:45.20,HERE AND I'M NOT GIVING UP. >> LET'S START MAKING THE FLAG.
259,00:16:47.80,00:16:47.80,>> AND MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A NAME.
260,00:16:52.07,00:16:52.07,>> LET'S GO FOR A WALK. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPECT IT

266,00:17:07.37,00:17:07.37,>> AS LONG AS CIERA IS WORKING HER.
267,00:17:08.90,00:17:08.90,>> I THINK SO. WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM.
268,00:17:13.13,00:17:13.13,>> LET'S GO DOWN ONE MORE. >> OKAY.
269,00:17:16.17,00:17:16.17,">> PLAYING WITH YOUR LOVED ONE, AND THEN MAKING IT TO THE MERGE,"
270,00:17:19.90,00:17:19.90,I FEEL SO BLESSED. BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE FACT
271,00:17:23.20,00:17:23.20,"THAT MY MOM CAUSED SOME RIFFS AND HAD SOME ENEMIES, CLEARLY,"
272,00:17:26.33,00:17:26.33,"BECAUSE THEY VOTED HER OUT. AND IT'S ALL SHIFTED, AND WITH"
273,00:17:29.73,00:17:29.73,"MY MOM COME BACK IN THE GAME, IT COULD REALLY HURT ME."
274,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,SO WHERE DO I START? SO HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
275,00:17:40.37,00:17:40.37,I'M IN AN ALLIANCE. >> WITH-- PLEASE TELL ME CALEB
276,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,AND HAYDEN. >> YES.
277,00:17:46.50,00:17:46.50,">> OH, GOOD. >> HERE'S WHERE IT GETS SKETCHY."
278,00:17:49.13,00:17:49.13,YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE SKETCHY AND HERE'S WHY.
279,00:17:52.57,00:17:52.57,BECAUSE IT WAS AN ALLIANCE FORMED ON BEAM POOEM WITHOUT
280,00:17:55.73,00:17:55.73,"LOVED ONES. IT'S ME, CADEN, TYSON AND"
281,00:18:00.93,00:18:00.93,GERVASE. AND WE PROMISED IECH OTHER FINAL
282,00:18:03.20,00:18:03.20,FIVE. DON'T TALK STRATEGY WITH
283,00:18:04.57,00:18:04.57,"ANYBODY, NO ONE. >> OKAY."
284,00:18:05.57,00:18:05.57,">> SO HERE'S THE THING, ARAS IS NEXT TO GO."
285,00:18:08.13,00:18:08.13,I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY MOM IS ON BOARD AND REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW
286,00:18:11.00,00:18:11.00,"WE'RE GOING TO PLAY IT. I FEEL LIKE I'M THE TEACHER YOU,"
287,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,"YOU KNOW, TEACHING MY MOM THE WAYS, THE WAYS OF THE TRIBE."
288,00:18:20.23,00:18:20.23,DON'T TOWK TAANYONE. >> ME AND CIERA ARE THE PEOPLE
289,00:18:22.93,00:18:22.93,THAT ARE GOING TO DECIDE WANT FATE OF EITHER THE COUPLES OR
290,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,THE FATE OF THE SINGLES. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HERE
291,00:18:28.23,00:18:28.23,"I WAS ON REDEMPTION ISLAND THINKING THE GAME IS OVER, AND"
292,00:18:31.27,00:18:31.27,NOW I'M IN A POWER POSITION IN THIS GAME OF WHO'S GOING TO GO
293,00:18:35.57,00:18:35.57,HOME? >> JUST DON'T PLAY HARD.
294,00:18:41.70,00:18:41.70,">> YOU GOING FOR A WALK, TYS? >> YEAH."
295,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,"OKAY, I'LL BE BACK. YOU GOTTA ACT FAST COME MERGE"
296,00:18:49.73,00:18:49.73,"TIME, SO NOW THE ONLY FACTOR IN THE GAME IS FINDING OUT WHERE"
297,00:18:53.87,00:18:53.87,"THE IMMUNITY IDOLS ARE. WHEN THE TRIBE SWAP HAPPENED,"
298,00:18:57.20,00:18:57.20,HAYDEN GAVE ME ALL THE INFO HE KNEW ABOUT THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
299,00:19:01.30,00:19:01.30,IDOL. I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S AT THE
300,00:19:03.77,00:19:03.77,GIANT TREE ON THE WAY TO THE WATERFALL.
301,00:19:16.80,00:19:16.80,OKAY. THIS HAS TO BE THE SERPENT TREE.
302,00:19:22.27,00:19:22.27,THIS IS THE SERPENT. SO MAYBE IF I DIG UNDERNEATH IT
303,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,OVER HERE. TA-DA!
304,00:19:53.20,00:19:53.20,I'M DEFINITELY NOT SHARING THIS WITH ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT NOW.
305,00:19:57.07,00:19:57.07,IF IT WORKS TO MY ADVANTAGE TO SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY IN MY
306,00:20:00.10,00:20:00.10,"ALLIANCE TO PUSH SOMEBODY ELSE OUT, THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO, BUT"
307,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,"RIGHT NOW, NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW I HAVE IT."
308,00:20:05.17,00:20:05.17,I STEPPED ON THAT PROBABLY LIKE 20 TIMES.
309,00:20:07.77,00:20:07.77,LET'S SEE HOW SWEET IT IS. I HOPE IT'S SOILED GOLD.
310,00:20:10.87,00:20:10.87,TRY IT ON. MAKE SURE IT FITS.
311,00:20:14.43,00:20:14.43,HOORAY. I HAVE NEVER HAD AN IDOL BEFORE
312,00:20:17.90,00:20:17.90,AND I'VE ALSO NEVER WON THE SHOW BEFORE.
313,00:20:20.23,00:20:20.23,DO THOSE CORRELATE DIRECTLY WITH ONE ANOTHER?
314,00:20:22.37,00:20:22.37,"PROBABLY NOT, BUT AT LEAST THIS IS A LITTLE MORE ADVANTAGE."
315,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,">> GOOD JOB, DUDE, YOU MADE IT. YOU MADE THE MERGE."
316,00:20:40.67,00:20:40.67,">> SKIN OF MY TEETH, BRO. >> I KNEW YOU WOULD."
317,00:20:43.40,00:20:43.40,>> I'M SO STOKED I GET TO PLAY WITH ARAS.
318,00:20:46.23,00:20:46.23,HE IS MY BROTHER AND I LOVE HIM AND I WANT TO GO DEEP IN THIS

332,00:21:26.27,00:21:26.27,"JRVE, AND ARAS AND MYSELF. THERE ARE SEVEN OF US."
333,00:21:29.33,00:21:29.33,>> I DON'T TRUST LAURA M. AT ALL I THINK SHE'S THE SCARIEST
334,00:21:34.57,00:21:34.57,PERSON IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW. GETTING RID OF LAURA IS NOT
335,00:21:38.63,00:21:38.63,"BECAUSE SHE WAS ON REDEMPTION ISLAND AND BACK, BUT SHE IS THE"
336,00:21:43.60,00:21:43.60,SAFEST PLAY. EVERYONE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE

338,00:21:48.93,00:21:48.93,WOULD MOBILIZE AGAINST US RIGHT AWAY.
339,00:21:51.13,00:21:51.13,BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET
340,00:21:54.20,00:21:54.20,"LAURA OR CIERA. >> ""BLOOD VERSUS WATER"" SHOULD"
341,00:21:57.83,00:21:57.83,IN THE END BE CALLED VYTAS VERSUS ARAS BECAUSE WE WOULD BE
342,00:22:05.67,00:22:05.67,STUPID RIGHT NOW NOT TO GET TO THE END.
343,00:22:20.07,00:22:20.07,>> YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON?
344,00:22:21.70,00:22:21.70,>> YES. HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME.
345,00:22:23.47,00:22:23.47,THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M NUMBER 5 AND MONICA'S HAPPY TO
346,00:22:26.33,00:22:26.33,MAKE IT TO 5 BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL IN
347,00:22:29.27,00:22:29.27,"WINNING. >> OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT I HAVE"

350,00:22:35.93,00:22:35.93,BECAUSE GERVASE THINKS HE'S FINAL THREE WITH ARAS AND TINA?
351,00:22:38.67,00:22:38.67,>> NO. I NEED TO TELL MONICA ABOUT THE
352,00:22:40.87,00:22:40.87,"PLAN TO GET ARAS OUT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SHOW HER A"
353,00:22:45.60,00:22:45.60,LITTLE LOVE. YOU HAVE TO SHOW HER SOME
354,00:22:47.80,00:22:47.80,RESPECT. JUST TO SOLIDIFY THE NUMBERS.
355,00:22:49.93,00:22:49.93,YOU'RE WITH US. THAT'S THE MAJORITY.
356,00:22:53.20,00:22:53.20,THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH.
357,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,WE TAKE ARAS OUT FIRST AND THEN START PLUCKING THEM OFF ONE BY
358,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,ONE. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS--
359,00:22:59.10,00:22:59.10,>> HERE'S THE THING. >> SHE JUST LIKES TO REPEAT THE
