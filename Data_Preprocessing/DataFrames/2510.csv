190,00:11:39.73,00:11:39.73,>> IT'S A PRETTY GOOD FEELING TO BE AWAY FROM THE GAME.
191,00:11:43.13,00:11:43.13,THAT'S WHY I AGREED WITH MALCOLM TO NOT TALK ABOUT STRATEGY TODAY
192,00:11:46.07,00:11:46.07,"BECAUSE I JUST NEED A COUPLE OF HOURS TO RELAX, THINK ABOUT"
193,00:11:50.13,00:11:50.13,EVERYTHING AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MY NEXT MOVE IS.
194,00:11:52.40,00:11:52.40,I'M SMART AND I'M FIT AND THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WITH FOOD
195,00:11:55.60,00:11:55.60,IT'S LIKE A BOOST. SO THE NEXT CHALLENGE I'M GOING
196,00:11:58.47,00:11:58.47,TO BE REFUELED AND READY TO KICK SOME BUTT.
197,00:12:02.13,00:12:02.13,"THIS WAS A GREAT REWARD. >> YEAH, IT WAS."
198,00:12:21.17,00:12:21.17,">> WHAT'S THIS, GUYS? IS THIS THEM?"
199,00:12:24.23,00:12:24.23,">> THEY'RE BACK ALREADY. >> WOW, LOOK AT THEIR HAIR!"

201,00:12:32.77,00:12:32.77,IT WAS LIKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
202,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20,I FELT LIKE I WAS IN -- LIKE IN THE DESERT AND IT WAS LIKE AN
203,00:12:39.90,00:12:39.90,OASIS. >> SO WE ARE HAVING A PRETTY
204,00:12:41.63,00:12:41.63,QUIET DAY. PRETTY RELAXING AND THEN ABI
205,00:12:43.93,00:12:43.93,"CAME BACK FROM THE REWARD AND WAS LIKE ""OH!"""
206,00:12:47.73,00:12:47.73,">> OH, MY STOMACH. I FEEL LIKE I HAD LIKE A THREE"

210,00:13:05.20,00:13:05.20,SUPER GRACIOUS WHEN THEY COME BACK FROM A REWARD.
211,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,BUT ABI'S DOWN RIGHT CRUEL. SHE FLAUNTED IT.
212,00:13:11.47,00:13:11.47,"AND SHE WOULDN'T STOP. >> YOU KNOW, IT WAS BREATHTAKING"
213,00:13:14.30,00:13:14.30,"JUST ARRIVING. LIKE, THE SITE WAS JUST LIKE"
214,00:13:17.53,00:13:17.53,SOMETHING FROM LIKE THE COVER OF A TRAVEL MAGAZINE.

219,00:13:32.57,00:13:32.57,">> IT WAS GORGEOUS. >> HOW ARE YOU FEELING, CARTER?"
220,00:13:35.93,00:13:35.93,"WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART? >> UM, THE SAUCES."
221,00:13:39.33,00:13:39.33,THERE WAS A SPICY ONE THAT I JUST --

225,00:13:52.80,00:13:52.80,>> IT WAS SO AMAZING. LIKE I FELT LIKE I WAS IN
226,00:13:56.70,00:13:56.70,PARADISE. LITERALLY.
227,00:13:57.50,00:13:57.50,I FELT LIKE I WAS A PEASANT HERE AND THEN LIKE A FAIRY JUST WENT
228,00:14:02.33,00:14:02.33,LIKE DING AND THEN I BECAME CINDERELLA.
229,00:14:06.33,00:14:06.33,">> YEAH, THE REWARDS ARE COOL. >> ABI HAS ALL THE SOCIAL GRACE"
230,00:14:10.40,00:14:10.40,OF A MACK TRUCK. SHE HAS NO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW
231,00:14:13.17,00:14:13.17,TO TALK TO PEOPLE. >> NOT ANY HOLDING BACK FOR HER.
232,00:14:16.20,00:14:16.20,>> NO. >> NO SOCIAL SKILLS.
233,00:14:19.80,00:14:19.80,ZERO. >> ME?

236,00:14:24.30,00:14:24.30,">> OH, OKAY. MAYBE I'M DEAF."
237,00:14:28.70,00:14:28.70,BUT I'M GLAD YOU GUYS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE BECAUSE I AM DONE
238,00:14:31.63,00:14:31.63,WITH THE KITCHEN. >> OKAY.
239,00:14:33.13,00:14:33.13,>> WHY? >> BECAUSE I'VE BEEN COOKING FOR
240,00:14:35.63,00:14:35.63,"26 DAYS, I'M OVER IT. AND I'M LEAVING SOON SO JUST"

248,00:15:00.97,00:15:00.97,">> YOU HAVE LOST YOUR FREAKING MIND, GIRL."
249,00:15:03.50,00:15:03.50,"PART OF ME JUST THINKS THAT'S FINE, JUST LET IT PISS EVERYBODY"
250,00:15:07.30,00:15:07.30,ELSE OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT?
251,00:15:08.63,00:15:08.63,YOUR TIME WILL COME. AND I MAY NOT GET TO TELL HER
252,00:15:11.30,00:15:11.30,ANYTHING UNTIL I'M WRITING HER NAME DOWN AND IT'S THAT TRIBAL
253,00:15:14.37,00:15:14.37,COUNCIL WHERE SHE'S FINALLY WALKING OUT AND I GET TO SAY YOU
254,00:15:17.23,00:15:17.23,KNOW WHAT? WHINERS ARE WEANERS.

263,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,AND ABI GO BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN DO THAT.
264,00:16:01.03,00:16:01.03,>> IT COULD HAPPEN SO WHEN IT GETS TO SIX IT'S EITHER GAME ON
265,00:16:04.73,00:16:04.73,OR WE MAKE A PLAN. >> DO YOU WANT TO WAIT THAT LONG
266,00:16:09.47,00:16:09.47,TO MAKE A PLAN? WITH A PRETTY EASY VOTE IN
267,00:16:12.07,00:16:12.07,"THEORY COMING UP, MY PLAN IS TO GET A FINAL FOUR SET UP TODAY."
268,00:16:17.53,00:16:17.53,AND JUST BE ABLE TO KIND OF COAST AFTER THIS NEXT VOTE UNTIL
269,00:16:20.43,00:16:20.43,THE END. >> I THINK IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR
270,00:16:22.57,00:16:22.57,THAT YOU AND DENICE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO VOTE TOGETHER.
271,00:16:27.00,00:16:27.00,"BUT WHO ELSE DO WE HAVE FOR SURE, FOR SURE, FOR SURE?"
272,00:16:30.70,00:16:30.70,>> LISA. IF IT'S YOU AND LISA AND ME AND
273,00:16:35.93,00:16:35.93,DENICE IT BECOMES VERY EASY VERY QUICKLY.
274,00:16:38.57,00:16:38.57,BUT LISA WOULD HAVE TO BE ON BOARD FOR THAT TO WORK.
275,00:16:41.47,00:16:41.47,>> I REALLY NEED TO FIND OUT IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE OR
276,00:16:45.00,00:16:45.00,NOT. MALCOLM PROPOSED TO ME HIM AND
277,00:16:54.07,00:16:54.07,DENICE AND YOU AND ME IN THE FINAL FOUR.
278,00:16:59.27,00:16:59.27,HE WANTS TO GO IN THE WOODS AND SHAKE ON IT.
279,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50,>> REALLY. WOW!
280,00:17:03.57,00:17:03.57,>> HE THINKS HE CAN TRUST US THE MOST.
281,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,IT COULD BE A BIG PLAY. >> WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE
282,00:17:07.73,00:17:07.73,"YOU TO THE FINAL FOUR, YOU HAVE TO SAY STRATEGICALLY HECK YES."
283,00:17:14.20,00:17:14.20,BECAUSE IF YOU SAY NO THEN YOU COULD END UP ODD MAN OUT.
284,00:17:17.70,00:17:17.70,AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
285,00:17:20.03,00:17:20.03,">> WHAT DO YOU ANY? >> YOU KNOW, WE'RE AT THE POINT"
286,00:17:25.60,00:17:25.60,WHERE WE NEED TO TRUST SOMEBODY. SO EITHER WE MAKE A SOLID PACT
287,00:17:30.20,00:17:30.20,WITH PENNER AND CARTER OR MALCOLM AND DENICE.
288,00:17:35.07,00:17:35.07,"WHO DO YOU TRUST MORE, PENNER OR MALCOLM?"
289,00:17:38.23,00:17:38.23,">> ODDLY ENOUGH, PENNER. >> ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO HAVE A"
290,00:17:42.40,00:17:42.40,CONVERSATION WITH PENNER. >> I HAVEN'T SAID TO ANYBODY
291,00:17:51.30,00:17:51.30,OTHER THAN YOU TWO THAT I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH YOU TWO.
292,00:17:57.20,00:17:57.20,">> WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S -- FIRST OFF, THANK YOU."
293,00:17:59.90,00:17:59.90,THAT'S COOL AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
294,00:18:02.20,00:18:02.20,BUT I PERSONALLY AM MORE THAN COMFORTABLE TAKING CARE OF
295,00:18:06.03,00:18:06.03,BUSINESS ONE THING AT A TIME. I REALLY AM COMFORTABLE TAKING
296,00:18:09.60,00:18:09.60,CARE OF ABI AND PETER BUT I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED IN
297,00:18:13.40,00:18:13.40,COMMITTING ANYTHING TO ANYBODY. NOT YET.
298,00:18:18.37,00:18:18.37,LISA RESPECTS ME AND SHE SAID I WANT TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE
299,00:18:21.40,00:18:21.40,WITH YOU AND SKUPIN. THAT'S A GREAT OPTION BUT IT'S
300,00:18:24.03,00:18:24.03,TOO EARLY FOR ME TO SAY WHO I SHOULD GO TO THE FINAL THREE
301,00:18:26.97,00:18:26.97,WITH. I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM
302,00:18:28.30,00:18:28.30,"CLOSE AND IF I GET BLINDSIDED, MORE POWER TO IT."
303,00:18:31.53,00:18:31.53,I WILL GO OUT WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH.
304,00:18:33.73,00:18:33.73,I DON'T WANT TO GET PEOPLE SQUIRRELY AND GET PEOPLE
305,00:18:35.93,00:18:35.93,STARTING TO THINK LIKE WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES.
306,00:18:39.37,00:18:39.37,WE ALL AGREED WE'D GO TO SIX AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO.
307,00:18:42.47,00:18:42.47,">> PENNER DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THAT ""WE'RE TRUE TO THE END"""
308,00:18:46.07,00:18:46.07,KIND OF DEAL. HE SAID LET'S JUST GET RID OF
309,00:18:48.90,00:18:48.90,THESE TWO AND SEE HOW THAT SHAKES DOWN.
310,00:18:52.33,00:18:52.33,SO I THINK HE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY.
311,00:19:03.37,00:19:03.37,>> WHERE IS EVERYBODY? >> I'M GONNA PROMISE ON MY
312,00:19:08.87,00:19:08.87,FAMILY THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR AND I'M NOT BREAKING IT.
313,00:19:11.60,00:19:11.60,THIS IS MY WORD COMPLETELY TO THE FINAL FOUR.
314,00:19:14.83,00:19:14.83,THIS IS AS SERIOUS A DEAL AS YOU CAN MAKE IN THIS GAME.
315,00:19:17.97,00:19:17.97,"THIS ISN'T JUST SOME QUICKIE ALLIANCE WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU"
316,00:19:21.13,00:19:21.13,"MA'AM, HE'S GONE WE'RE ON OUR OWN."
317,00:19:24.03,00:19:24.03,"I STUCK MY NECK OUT, I'M STICKING WITH IT."
318,00:19:26.23,00:19:26.23,"IF IT WORKS OUT, IT COULD BE THE BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME"
319,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,"IN THE GAME. >> FINAL FOUR, ABSOLUTELY."
320,00:19:30.30,00:19:30.30,>> FINAL FOUR. >> FINAL FOUR.
321,00:19:31.70,00:19:31.70,>> I'VE COMMITTED TO A FINAL FOUR WITH MALCOLM.
322,00:19:34.30,00:19:34.30,I'M NOT TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH IT BECAUSE HE'S A GAMER.
323,00:19:37.20,00:19:37.20,AND THAT WORRIES ME. BUT I FELT I HAD TO.
324,00:19:39.63,00:19:39.63,I FELT I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. SO IT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
325,00:19:43.77,00:19:43.77,I WANT TO BE THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS SO IS I'M GOING TO DO
326,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,EVERYTHING I CAN TO WIN THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

368,00:22:52.67,00:22:52.67,"PENNER REALLY STRUGGLING. MALCOLM FALLS OFF, HE'S GOT TO"
369,00:22:57.33,00:22:57.33,GO BACK. DENICE IS IN THIS.
370,00:22:59.97,00:22:59.97,"RIGHT NOW IT'S DENICE, CARTER AND SKUPIN WITH MALCOLM TRYING"
371,00:23:03.03,00:23:03.03,TO CATCH UP AND PENNER OUT OF IT.
372,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83,SKUPIN IS THROUGH. SKUPIN MOVING ON.
373,00:23:10.23,00:23:10.23,IT'S NOW CARTER AND DENICE LOOKING FOR THOSE LAST TWO.
374,00:23:13.43,00:23:13.43,CARTER'S THROUGH. ONE SPOT LEFT.
375,00:23:16.47,00:23:16.47,MALCOLM HAS TO PICK IT UP! IT WON'T MATTER.
376,00:23:19.70,00:23:19.70,DENICE MOVES ON TO JOIN CARTER AND SKUPIN IN THE FINAL ROUND.
377,00:23:26.93,00:23:26.93,"ALL RIGHT. IT IS CARTER, SKUPIN AND DENICE."
378,00:23:30.23,00:23:30.23,HERE WE GO. SURVIVORS READY?
379,00:23:35.37,00:23:35.37,"GO! DENICE IS TO THE BOAT FIRST, OUT"
380,00:23:42.67,00:23:42.67,TO A BIT OF A LEAD. CARTER RIGHT ON HER TAIL AND
381,00:23:45.90,00:23:45.90,THERE'S SKUPIN. IT'S VERY EVEN OFF THE TOP.
382,00:23:50.10,00:23:50.10,CARTER'S DOING IT ALL WITHOUT LEAVING THE BOAT.
383,00:23:53.37,00:23:53.37,IT COULD BE A GOOD STRATEGY. SKUPIN NOW PICKING UP THE PIECE.
384,00:23:56.70,00:23:56.70,DENICE SLOWING DOWN. IT'S HARD TO GET AROUND THAT
385,00:24:02.33,00:24:02.33,BOAT. CARTER BACK IN THE WATER.
386,00:24:04.33,00:24:04.33,"DENICE BACK IN THE WATER. IT IS SKUPIN, CARTER AND DENICE"
387,00:24:09.20,00:24:09.20,ALL VERY EVEN. CARTER NOW WITH A BIT OF A LEAD.
388,00:24:12.63,00:24:12.63,"SKUPIN AND DENICE, YOU'VE GOT TO PICK IT UP!"
389,00:24:16.47,00:24:16.47,IT'S CARTER FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY SKUPIN AND DENICE.
390,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,CARTER GETS JAMMED UP A LITTLE. SKUPIN NOW RIGHT ON CARTER'S
391,00:24:29.23,00:24:29.23,TAIL. IT'S CARTER AND SKUPIN.
392,00:24:30.60,00:24:30.60,"HERE COMES DENICE! KEEP MOVING, DENICE!"
393,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83,YOU'VE GOT TO MANAGE THAT ROPE OR IT WILL TIE YOU UP.
394,00:24:38.00,00:24:38.00,SKUPIN NOW IN THE LEAD. CARTER'S HUNG UP!
395,00:24:42.43,00:24:42.43,CARTER'S NOW GOT TO CATCH SKUPIN.
396,00:24:45.00,00:24:45.00,THIS IS IT. ONE LAST KNOT TO MANEUVER!
397,00:24:47.90,00:24:47.90,"SKUPIN HAS A BIT OF A LEAD, CARTER IS THERE WITH HIM."
398,00:24:51.23,00:24:51.23,IT'S SKUPIN AND CARTER NAVIGATING THAT LAST PIECE OF
399,00:24:55.30,00:24:55.30,ROPE. ONE KNOT.
400,00:24:56.10,00:24:56.10,WHO WILL IT BE? SKUPIN WAS IN THE LEAD.
401,00:24:58.70,00:24:58.70,THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE. CARTER IS THROUGH!
402,00:25:05.97,00:25:05.97,CARTER WINS IMMUNITY! GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
403,00:25:09.87,00:25:09.87,"SEVEN! CARTER, COME ON OVER."
404,00:25:15.97,00:25:15.97,NICE JOB. THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
405,00:25:18.47,00:25:18.47,>> THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. SKUPIN!

407,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,GUARANTEED A 1-7 SHOT OF WINNING THIS GAME.
408,00:25:26.67,00:25:26.67,"AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 27 DAYS, SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME"
409,00:25:31.30,00:25:31.30,"TONIGHT. GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO"
410,00:25:32.87,00:25:32.87,"CAMP, SEE YOU AT TRIBAL. CONGRATS."
411,00:25:34.77,00:25:34.77,">> THANK YOU. >> NICELY DONE, CARTER."
412,00:25:54.97,00:25:54.97,"NICELY DONE. >> THAT WAS FUN, HUH."
413,00:25:57.83,00:25:57.83,>> IT WAS A GOOD CHALLENGE. >> HOW DOES IT FEEL?
414,00:26:00.13,00:26:00.13,>> FEELS GOOD. >> TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS A
415,00:26:04.23,00:26:04.23,"REALLY FUN CHALLENGE. HOWEVER, I DIDN'T WIN IT."
416,00:26:08.00,00:26:08.00,"AND PETER DID NOT WIN AS WELL SO IT'S BASICALLY PETER, ABI AND"
417,00:26:12.90,00:26:12.90,THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. IT'S LIKE AN ALLIANCE OF THREE
418,00:26:16.47,00:26:16.47,VERSUS SIX. >> LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE.
419,00:26:19.53,00:26:19.53,LET'S SPLIT 3-3. IF SHE DOES NOT PLAY THE IDOL
420,00:26:23.30,00:26:23.30,AND IT'S A TIE THEN WE ALL VOTE FOR HER.
421,00:26:27.40,00:26:27.40,>> GOT IT. >> AND SHE'LL WALK HOME WITH THE
422,00:26:31.33,00:26:31.33,IDOL. BUT I'M ASSUMING SHE WILL PLAY
423,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,THE IDOL AND HE'LL GO HOME. >> PETE AND ABI CANNOT WIN THIS
424,00:26:39.13,00:26:39.13,"GAME, THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS."
425,00:26:40.63,00:26:40.63,THERE'S NO REASON TO KEEP THEM AROUND.
426,00:26:42.33,00:26:42.33,"THEIR SHIP HAS SAILED. NOW, COULD SOMEBODY SURPRISE ME"
427,00:26:45.37,00:26:45.37,AND PLAY AN INCREDIBLY STUPID MOVE?
428,00:26:48.47,00:26:48.47,MAYBE. BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE ALL OF US
429,00:26:50.77,00:26:50.77,IN THE SIX ARE GOING TO STAY STRONG.
430,00:26:53.63,00:26:53.63,SO EITHER PETE OR ABI WILL GO HOME.
431,00:26:55.57,00:26:55.57,COULD IT SCREW UP? YEAH.
432,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET HIT BY A CAR WALKING FROM YOUR HOUSE"
433,00:27:01.53,00:27:01.53,"TO THE POST BOX, TOO. >> YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MOVES TO"
434,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,BE MADE. MALCOLM HE HAS POWER.

437,00:27:22.30,00:27:22.30,GAME TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. I WENT FROM THE TOP OF THE
438,00:27:25.60,00:27:25.60,PECKING ORDER ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM.
439,00:27:27.40,00:27:27.40,"BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IN AND BE LIKE, ""OKAY, GUYS, VOTE ME"

441,00:27:33.33,00:27:33.33,SOMETHING GOING. MALCOLM IS THE BIGGEST THREAT ON
442,00:27:35.27,00:27:35.27,"THE ISLAND, HE HAS AN IDOL AND HE NEEDS TO GO HOME."
443,00:27:38.23,00:27:38.23,>> HOPEFULLY SKUPIN WILL BE ON BOARD.

448,00:27:51.80,00:27:51.80,COULD BE TURNED EASILY. BUT ALL I NEED IS ONE PERSON TO
449,00:27:55.43,00:27:55.43,FLIP. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW

452,00:28:08.50,00:28:08.50,WITHOUT KNOWING WHO WOULD VOTE FOR MALCOLM.

454,00:28:13.47,00:28:13.47,AND IF WE WERE STILL IN AN ALLIANCE WHERE I'D GIVEN YOU MY
455,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,WORD I WOULD BE TOTALLY ON BOARD FOR THIS.
456,00:28:19.30,00:28:19.30,BUT I TOLD THEM I WOULD VOTE WITH THEM.
457,00:28:20.97,00:28:20.97,>> BUT YOU STARTED A GAME WITH US.
458,00:28:24.60,00:28:24.60,>> I DID. AND I MEANT IT.

462,00:28:35.27,00:28:35.27,>> SO THAT'S MY PLAN. I'M TRYING TO STAY ALIVE.

464,00:28:42.70,00:28:42.70,>> I'M IN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT. >> MALCOLM'S NOT GOING TO USE
465,00:28:49.40,00:28:49.40,HIS IDOL AND NOT GOING TO BLIND SIDE YOU?
466,00:28:51.80,00:28:51.80,>> EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS GONE AGAINST ME AT ONE POINT OR
467,00:28:55.20,00:28:55.20,ANOTHER. SO I DON'T TRUST ANY OF THEM
468,00:28:57.03,00:28:57.03,COMPLETELY. >> GOOD.
469,00:28:57.57,00:28:57.57,>> BUT THEY DO TRUST ME. YOU SEE?
470,00:29:00.13,00:29:00.13,BECAUSE I HAVE NOT BETRAYED THEM ONCE.
471,00:29:02.87,00:29:02.87,AND THAT IS WHAT I AM SAILING ON.
472,00:29:05.53,00:29:05.53,"YOU WENT FAR IN THE GAME, YOU DID WELL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO"
473,00:29:09.07,00:29:09.07,"WIN THIS TIME. >> ALL RIGHT, ABI'S PLAYING HER"
474,00:29:13.77,00:29:13.77,IDOL SO DO I HAVE TO SCRAMMABLE? THEY'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE
475,00:29:15.50,00:29:15.50,"TONIGHT, RIGHT? IF THEY SPLIT THE VOTE AND WE"
476,00:29:18.73,00:29:18.73,GET ONE PERSON WE CAN TAKE OUT MALCOLM.
477,00:29:21.20,00:29:21.20,JUST TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE VOTING FOR ME OR WHATEVER AND
478,00:29:23.80,00:29:23.80,THAT WOULD BE ONE VOTE LESS ME. ABI WOULD PLAY THE IDOL AND
479,00:29:27.27,00:29:27.27,"WHOEVER WE ALL VOTED FOR WOULD GO HOME, WHICH WOULD BE MALCOLM."
480,00:29:32.57,00:29:32.57,MALCOLM IS THE BIGGEST PERSON IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.
481,00:29:35.00,00:29:35.00,MALCOLM KIND OF CONTROLS THE GAME RIGHT NOW AND HE HAS THE
482,00:29:37.93,00:29:37.93,"IDOL. >> HE DOES, HE DOES."

484,00:29:42.37,00:29:42.37,BIG THREAT IN CHALLENGES AND A BIG THREAT IN THE SOCIAL GAME.
485,00:29:46.27,00:29:46.27,"I MEAN, WOULD YOU BE UP FOR IT? WE'RE BOTH VOTING FOR MALCOLM NO"
486,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,MATTER WHAT. STRATEGICALLY I WANT TO GET RID
487,00:29:56.87,00:29:56.87,OF HIM. >> HE'S THE BIGGEST WILD CARD IN
488,00:29:59.53,00:29:59.53,"THIS GAME. >> YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE"
489,00:30:03.43,00:30:03.43,IDOL. >> I HAVE A DEAL TO GO TO THE
490,00:30:05.50,00:30:05.50,FINAL FOUR WITH MALCOLM BUT NOW I'M STARTING TO RETHINK WHETHER
491,00:30:08.93,00:30:08.93,THAT WAS A SMART THING TO DO OR NOT BECAUSE HE'S PLAYING THE
492,00:30:14.50,00:30:14.50,HARDEST. MALCOLM'S A THREAT IN
493,00:30:16.37,00:30:16.37,"CHALLENGES. HE'S A SMART, STRATEGIC PLAYER"
494,00:30:19.47,00:30:19.47,AND HE'S LIKED BY EVERYBODY. SO IF I'M SITTING NEXT TO
495,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,MALCOLM IN THE FINAL THREE I'M NOT SURE I COULD BEAT HIM.
496,00:30:26.67,00:30:26.67,>> VOTE FOR MALCOLM AND HE GETS BLINDSIDED AND BRINGS IT HOME IN
497,00:30:30.17,00:30:30.17,"HIS POCKET. >> MAN, THAT WOULD BE HUGE."
498,00:30:33.30,00:30:33.30,">> YEAH. >> I MEAN, YOU'VE NEVER DONE ME"
499,00:30:35.63,00:30:35.63,WRONG THIS WHOLE GAME AND I -- >> YEAH.
500,00:30:40.07,00:30:40.07,SO I'M NOT SAYING NO. THE RISK OF CHANGING IT UP AGAIN
501,00:30:44.60,00:30:44.60,IS IT COULD BACKFIRE. BUT DO I ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT
502,00:30:49.20,00:30:49.20,ALLIANCE STAYING STRONG UNTIL THE FINAL FOUR AND THEN HAVING
503,00:30:53.10,00:30:53.10,THIS HAPPY ENDING? IT'S NOT THAT LIKELY IN THIS
504,00:30:56.63,00:30:56.63,GAME. SHE HAD AN INCREDIBLY COCKAMAMIE

507,00:31:08.43,00:31:08.43,PLAN'S GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT. >> APPARENTLY PETE AND ABI JUST
508,00:31:12.20,00:31:12.20,REALIZED THE EASIEST WAY TO GET SOMEBODY TO FLIP IS TO THROW MY
509,00:31:14.83,00:31:14.83,NAME OUT THERE AND RUN ME OVER TONIGHT.
510,00:31:16.87,00:31:16.87,THEY JUST NEED ONE PERSON TO FLOP AND I'M GOING HOME.
511,00:31:21.57,00:31:21.57,I HAVE THE IDOL BUT IF NOBODY FLIPS AND I PLAY THAT THING I
512,00:31:25.37,00:31:25.37,LOSE A LOT OF LEVERAGE MOVING FORWARD.
513,00:31:28.37,00:31:28.37,>> JUST TO FIRM UP WHAT WE'RE DOING.

611,00:37:00.10,00:37:00.10,IT'S LIKE BRINGING SOMEONE TO A POKER GAME THAT'S NEVER PLAYED
