6,00:00:18.42,00:00:18.42,>> I want to ask you guys if I can take my son's name...
7,00:00:21.25,00:00:21.25,>> Done. >> Done?
8,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,">> PROBST: ...the Casaya women granted Shane his wish, and the"
9,00:00:25.21,00:00:25.21,"alliance of Shane, Courtney, Danielle, and Aras was broken."
10,00:00:28.79,00:00:28.79,">> Well, if that's how you feel about it, then fine."
11,00:00:31.04,00:00:31.04,"Get out of the alliance, you're off anyway."
12,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,"See you later, bye. >> PROBST: At La Mina, alone"
13,00:00:36.46,00:00:36.46,"amongst four men, Sally knew she was in trouble."
14,00:00:39.50,00:00:39.50,">> The four guys are kind of doing, like, a boys' club thing,"
15,00:00:42.67,00:00:42.67,but I think it's shortsighted. >> PROBST: The challenge was
16,00:00:46.12,00:00:46.12,both for immunity and reward. You will go to a local
17,00:00:49.12,00:00:49.12,"Panamanian fishing village, you'll have a Panamanian"
18,00:00:51.83,00:00:51.83,"barbecue. >> Oh, yeah."
19,00:00:53.33,00:00:53.33,">> PROBST: But in a twist, one person from the losing tribe"
20,00:00:56.46,00:00:56.46,would be saved. The person you send to Exile
21,00:00:59.25,00:00:59.25,Island will not go to Tribal Council tonight.
22,00:01:02.04,00:01:02.04,That means they cannot be voted out.
23,00:01:05.21,00:01:05.21,Terry's back with the last puzzle piece.
24,00:01:06.92,00:01:06.92,La Mina took an early lead. Dan and Sally quickly getting to
25,00:01:09.33,00:01:09.33,work. >> Roll it.

31,00:01:23.33,00:01:23.33,>> Sally. >> PROBST: Casaya sent Sally to
32,00:01:25.88,00:01:25.88,"Exile Island, saving her from certain elimination."
33,00:01:28.75,00:01:28.75,Boat's waiting. >> I felt like there was a
34,00:01:30.79,00:01:30.79,pretty strong alliance between the four guys and that I would
35,00:01:33.17,00:01:33.17,"be the one to go, so tonight this is the safest place for me"
36,00:01:35.92,00:01:35.92,to be. >> I'm so happy right now.
37,00:01:40.08,00:01:40.08,">> PROBST: At the Panamanian village reward, Casaya filled"
38,00:01:42.29,00:01:42.29,"their bellies... >> Oh, my God."
39,00:01:44.25,00:01:44.25,I just ate everything in sight. >> Hyah!
40,00:01:46.21,00:01:46.21,>> PROBST: ...and got their minds off the game for an

43,00:01:56.33,00:01:56.33,"for the idol that Terry had already found, back at La"

45,00:02:01.92,00:02:01.92,where he's not come through. >> PROBST: ...the boys' club was
46,00:02:04.29,00:02:04.29,about to lose a member. >> I think that the remaining
47,00:02:07.12,00:02:07.12,"three strongest men would be me, Nick, and Austin."
48,00:02:10.33,00:02:10.33,"Dan's odd man out. I feel bad, but that's the way"
49,00:02:13.25,00:02:13.25,it is. >> PROBST: At a painful Tribal
50,00:02:16.62,00:02:16.62,Council... >> There is nothing about Dan
51,00:02:19.25,00:02:19.25,that needs to go. We're just down to a situation
52,00:02:21.62,00:02:21.62,where somebody has to go. >> PROBST: Sixth person voted
53,00:02:24.25,00:02:24.25,out of Survivor: Exile Island... Dan the astronaut calmly
54,00:02:27.04,00:02:27.04,"accepted his fate... Dan, the tribe has spoken."
55,00:02:30.12,00:02:30.12,...and his tribe stood respectfully as he gave his
56,00:02:32.92,00:02:32.92,final salute. Ten are left.
57,00:02:35.62,00:02:35.62,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
58,00:03:09.50,00:03:09.50,">> I'm freezing. >> Courtney, I'm not-- I'm not"
59,00:03:21.71,00:03:21.71,the only one using it. It's also Cirie-- it's under
60,00:03:24.33,00:03:24.33,"Cirie as well. >> And, like, no warmth."
61,00:03:57.04,00:03:57.04,I was shaking. Last night was the worst night I
62,00:04:00.38,00:04:00.38,ever had. I literally did not know what to
63,00:04:03.33,00:04:03.33,"do with myself. Everyone was cuddled and dry,"
64,00:04:06.25,00:04:06.25,"and I'm wet and, like, alone in, like, a little ball."
65,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00,"I mean, I'm... and also I just feel like my innards, like,"
66,00:04:13.62,00:04:13.62,"inside is, like, freezing still. Everything I own is soaked."
67,00:04:21.08,00:04:21.08,"And Shane just, like-- instead of, like, even feeling that I'm,"
68,00:04:25.04,00:04:25.04,"like, shivering and, like-- he just was elbowing me with his"
69,00:04:28.12,00:04:28.12,"elbow. It was just like, ""Ugh."""
70,00:04:31.46,00:04:31.46,I cannot trust Shane and I don't want to deal with him anymore.
71,00:04:35.12,00:04:35.12,"He had a freak-out on us, and he said, ""Please give me back my"
72,00:04:38.25,00:04:38.25,"son's name. I want out of this alliance."""
73,00:04:40.42,00:04:40.42,"So, we're like, ""Oh, good-bye. Fine, we'll see you later."""
74,00:05:00.58,00:05:00.58,>> I know I'm still an outsider to Casaya.
75,00:05:04.21,00:05:04.21,I just want to make the merge. The whole ball game's going to
76,00:05:07.92,00:05:07.92,change big time and I'm gonna be there standing.
77,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,>> Exile Island for me is my saving grace.
78,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,It's not hurting me one bit to be out here away from the rest
79,00:05:29.50,00:05:29.50,of my tribe. Happy to still be here and
80,00:05:35.54,00:05:35.54,excited to see what's in store. I've been spending some time
81,00:05:41.00,00:05:41.00,"just digging a little here and there, and I don't know if Terry"
82,00:05:43.79,00:05:43.79,has found the immunity idol. I hope he hasn't.
83,00:05:48.25,00:05:48.25,Maybe I'll get lucky. >> We'll have slugs for lunch
84,00:06:03.79,00:06:03.79,and beans for dinner. >> Sounds good to me.
85,00:06:07.33,00:06:07.33,I'm very anxious about what's going to happen next.
86,00:06:10.38,00:06:10.38,Depending on when the merge comes is going to play a huge
87,00:06:13.88,00:06:13.88,"role in how far Terry, Nick, myself, and Sally will be able"
88,00:06:17.83,00:06:17.83,"to make it in this game. >> ""What the heck is it?"
89,00:06:28.92,00:06:28.92,This thing we are looking for. Could it be buried treasure?
90,00:06:31.67,00:06:31.67,"""Or something worth much more? I'd start searching"
91,00:06:34.33,00:06:34.33,"On your back beach. ""Look for something"
92,00:06:36.12,00:06:36.12,"That ain't quite right. But when you finally find it,"
93,00:06:39.21,00:06:39.21,"""You may be more comfortable Tonight."""
94,00:06:42.04,00:06:42.04,>> We just got some tree mail telling us we were going on a
95,00:06:44.42,00:06:44.42,treasure hunt. Marvin Gaye said it best:
96,00:06:46.75,00:06:46.75,"""Let's get it on"" up in this piece."
97,00:06:49.21,00:06:49.21,>> I'm hoping it's something edible.
98,00:06:51.04,00:06:51.04,">> I'm hoping it's something edible, too."
99,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,"I mean, what else could we have to make our thing more"
100,00:06:55.21,00:06:55.21,comfortable other than a Posturepedic bed?
101,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,>> We got tree mail saying there'd be something on our back
102,00:07:00.50,00:07:00.50,"beach that wasn't quite right. On the way out there, we're"
103,00:07:03.88,00:07:03.88,"thinking, ""Oh, I hope it's something to eat."
104,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,"""I hope it's really something substantial to eat."""
105,00:07:18.75,00:07:18.75,">> Whoa, firewood. >> Got wood, that's nice."
106,00:07:23.96,00:07:23.96,"""Do not open any of the packages until you arrive and are"
107,00:07:27.54,00:07:27.54,"gathered together with the members of the Casaya tribe."""
108,00:07:30.12,00:07:30.12,"Uh-oh. >> Merger, boys."
109,00:07:32.25,00:07:32.25,Pack it up. Whoo-hoo!
110,00:07:35.21,00:07:35.21,I couldn't be happier. That means we're going to be
111,00:07:37.17,00:07:37.17,"reunited with the other tribe tonight, ready for a new"
112,00:07:40.25,00:07:40.25,"adventure, ready to shake things up, get to know some new people."
113,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,"That's what this is all about, so... can't wait."
114,00:07:47.04,00:07:47.04,">> All right, I'm gonna start feeding it over to you guys."
115,00:07:50.29,00:07:50.29,We're down six-four. The merge could be disastrous
116,00:07:52.33,00:07:52.33,for us. If we don't get somebody to
117,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,"switch over right away, we'll just get picked off."
118,00:07:56.83,00:07:56.83,We need to get over there and find out who exactly is aligned
119,00:07:59.92,00:07:59.92,and who is not. I'm gonna hit up Bruce and see
120,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,"where he lies, Shane as well. What I'm hoping for is to switch"
121,00:08:08.38,00:08:08.38,"the numbers to our advantage, and then we just pick them off."
122,00:08:13.17,00:08:13.17,My ace in the hole is the immunity idol.
123,00:08:15.79,00:08:15.79,I would personally not want to pull it out of my pocket till
124,00:08:18.04,00:08:18.04,"the final four, but if I need to use that thing strategically,"
125,00:08:22.71,00:08:22.71,then I'll do it. >> It'll be sad just to leave
126,00:08:29.25,00:08:29.25,the tight dynamic that we have here with the four remaining
127,00:08:32.25,00:08:32.25,"members, but I'm ready to meet some new personalities, get in"
128,00:08:35.83,00:08:35.83,"there, start bobbing and weaving like Sugar Ray Leonard, see if I"
129,00:08:39.04,00:08:39.04,can come out victorious. >> We're not doing anything.
130,00:09:14.12,00:09:14.12,I don't think any of us feel like doing anything today.
131,00:09:17.21,00:09:17.21,"You know, we're just collecting wood, making fire, eating rice,"
132,00:09:22.00,00:09:22.00,"drinking water. Really exciting, isn't it?"
133,00:09:24.88,00:09:24.88,Riveting. Oh! >> Delicious.
134,00:09:28.17,00:09:28.17,>> \xe2\x99\xaa And nutritious. \xe2\x99\xaa >> Who is it though?
135,00:09:35.08,00:09:35.08,>> It's three of them. >> So who went home-- Austin...
136,00:09:41.04,00:09:41.04,or Terry? >> We're having a nice lazy day.
137,00:09:44.79,00:09:44.79,We had a feeling a merge might come and we saw the boat coming.
138,00:09:48.42,00:09:48.42,"Is that Nick in the back? >> No, that's Terry in the back."
139,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,">> We knew they were hungry and all of us just chowed the rice,"
140,00:09:55.75,00:09:55.75,'cause... 'cause we're heathens and we didn't want to share.
141,00:09:59.83,00:09:59.83,>> I hope they feel strong and feel like building us a new
142,00:10:02.17,00:10:02.17,"shelter. >> Hey, come here quickly, come"
143,00:10:04.21,00:10:04.21,"here. All six of us right here, right"
144,00:10:06.46,00:10:06.46,now. >> We're eating as much rice as
145,00:10:08.04,00:10:08.04,we can and then we bring it in together while they're paddling
146,00:10:10.92,00:10:10.92,"like, ""Stay together, don't give them a thing."""
147,00:10:13.17,00:10:13.17,>> I'm so proud of us. We've worked ourselves here.
148,00:10:16.12,00:10:16.12,They have less than us. We have more.
149,00:10:18.62,00:10:18.62,"We stay together, we get to the top six."
150,00:10:21.04,00:10:21.04,">> One, two, three... >> ALL: Believe!"
151,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,>> Damn! >> We're going to welcome them
152,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,"in with open arms. ""Welcome to our house, but we're"
153,00:10:27.50,00:10:27.50,"going to vote you off one by one by one by one."""
154,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,>> You've arrived! >> Come on in!
155,00:10:34.58,00:10:34.58,Finally! Whoo! >> Terry and Austin and I are
156,00:10:37.75,00:10:37.75,paddling into shore and they're standing there waiting for us
157,00:10:40.38,00:10:40.38,with open arms. They just welcomed us into their
158,00:10:42.25,00:10:42.25,home. >> Welcome back.
159,00:10:44.08,00:10:44.08,You look great. >> How are you?
160,00:10:45.04,00:10:45.04,I'm Shane. >> Introductions start.
161,00:10:48.33,00:10:48.33,"Everybody says hello, the hugs come."
162,00:10:51.54,00:10:51.54,>> I guess my initial concern is Bruce.
163,00:10:54.25,00:10:54.25,"Bruce does have a relationship with Terry, per the original"
164,00:10:57.00,00:10:57.00,tribes. This is Survivor.
165,00:10:59.33,00:10:59.33,"You know people can flip-flop. >> Hey, my man."
166,00:11:02.92,00:11:02.92,">> Oh, God, I've lost you! >> Good to be here, Bruce."
167,00:11:04.50,00:11:04.50,Good to be here. I'm so excited to have your face
168,00:11:07.25,00:11:07.25,"around with this merge, meet the new people,"
169,00:11:10.58,00:11:10.58,I could just feel a sense of wonderful things about them.
170,00:11:14.17,00:11:14.17,">> I'm so happy to be here, man. >> Hey, Cirie!"
171,00:11:16.67,00:11:16.67,">> Hi to you, too. >> Terry and I respect each"
172,00:11:18.50,00:11:18.50,"other, and just to be with him again is, like, just a pleasure."
173,00:11:23.17,00:11:23.17,">> Sally! >> Sally made it, too."
174,00:11:26.42,00:11:26.42,(cheering) >> Sally!
175,00:11:31.08,00:11:31.08,>> I get here to this new place I've never seen before and
176,00:11:33.92,00:11:33.92,"I'm just, like, ""What is going on?"
177,00:11:36.38,00:11:36.38,"""Everybody's together. Is this the merge?"""
178,00:11:37.96,00:11:37.96,"And Bruce comes, like, trucking out of, like, the group of"
179,00:11:40.38,00:11:40.38,"people, and is the first person so excited to see me and gives"
180,00:11:43.96,00:11:43.96,me a huge hug. >> Yeah!
181,00:11:47.50,00:11:47.50,>> And then there was this crate.
182,00:11:49.79,00:11:49.79,>> Let's open it up! >> Let's open it.
183,00:11:53.00,00:11:53.00,">> Another message, oh, no. >> Read it, Bruce."
184,00:11:55.17,00:11:55.17,">> ""Congratulations, you're all one tribe."

189,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,">> Oh, fruit! Oh, Bruce."
190,00:12:15.17,00:12:15.17,">> Sally, pub snacks, honey. Pub snacks."
191,00:12:17.62,00:12:17.62,>> Chocolate! >> Inside the box was fresh
192,00:12:21.38,00:12:21.38,"fruit and jarred, pickled goodies, crackers and cheese"
193,00:12:27.08,00:12:27.08,and wine. I kind of wanted to slap myself
194,00:12:29.25,00:12:29.25,for eating all that rice before they got here.
195,00:12:32.08,00:12:32.08,>> I am a glutton right now and it feels spectacular.
196,00:12:36.75,00:12:36.75,">> It was a very cordial gathering, everyone sharing"
197,00:12:39.42,00:12:39.42,"everything, everyone being really pleasant, and I could"
198,00:12:42.75,00:12:42.75,sense there probably was a little bit of sizing up.
199,00:12:45.38,00:12:45.38,I was a little surprised at how well we were welcomed.
200,00:12:48.38,00:12:48.38,I thought there might be a little bit more of a competitive
201,00:12:51.08,00:12:51.08,"edge, but I didn't see it. >> Oh, good, this is really big."
202,00:13:08.62,00:13:08.62,Spread that far corner. >> Yeah.
203,00:13:10.25,00:13:10.25,">> You can attach here and here and here and to another post,"
204,00:13:12.83,00:13:12.83,so... >> La Mina came over from the
205,00:13:15.08,00:13:15.08,"merge with the tarp and our shelter was really great, but I"
206,00:13:18.75,00:13:18.75,think this one that they're building now is gonna be
207,00:13:21.08,00:13:21.08,"amazing. >> And this side over here, you"
208,00:13:22.83,00:13:22.83,might be able to keep this side attached to that tree open.
209,00:13:25.67,00:13:25.67,">> All right, here's the deal. It's hard to tell, but I think"
210,00:13:28.04,00:13:28.04,"Terry does not have the immunity idol, so the next time"
211,00:13:31.75,00:13:31.75,"he doesn't get immunity, he's out."
212,00:13:45.67,00:13:45.67,>> It's a whole new ball game and I'm all about getting it
213,00:13:48.79,00:13:48.79,"swung to my side, and so we're just looking for two people."
214,00:13:51.92,00:13:51.92,Two people to swing the total game our way.
215,00:13:54.21,00:13:54.21,"And one to definitely make a good swing vote, but two to"
216,00:13:57.62,00:13:57.62,clinch it. So if you were worried at all
217,00:14:03.04,00:14:03.04,about what may happen in the next vote...
218,00:14:07.12,00:14:07.12,"All we need is one person, and we'll be even."
219,00:14:10.92,00:14:10.92,"And I'll tell you this, listen. You come over, and we, we will"
220,00:14:15.25,00:14:15.25,go to the final five. We thought Bruce might be a
221,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,"little bit of an outsider here, so I instantly attempted to"
222,00:14:23.17,00:14:23.17,bring him into the La Mina fold and give him sanctuary right
223,00:14:26.96,00:14:26.96,away. I will look you in the eye and
224,00:14:29.42,00:14:29.42,"shake your hand on it. And you know, you know..."
225,00:14:32.21,00:14:32.21,>> And I know you're the man to do it.
226,00:14:33.71,00:14:33.71,">> That's right. >> You know I am, too."
227,00:14:35.42,00:14:35.42,">> If anyone would flop, I think it would be Bruce."
228,00:14:38.17,00:14:38.17,"I think Bruce is the most worried about being accepted,"
229,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33,"and I think he might have some issues with, you know, wanting"
230,00:14:42.71,00:14:42.71,to be accepted by Terry. Aras's and my strategy with
231,00:14:45.46,00:14:45.46,Bruce is to make him feel like our leader so that he won't go
232,00:14:49.88,00:14:49.88,"away, he won't fall on us. >> Bruce, you're... man, you're"
233,00:14:53.83,00:14:53.83,"doing-- now, it's intensive, man."
234,00:14:56.71,00:14:56.71,"You run the show now, man. Hey, no, come here."
235,00:14:59.17,00:14:59.17,"Hey. Hey, Bruce. I know that, and I'm saying,"
236,00:15:06.21,00:15:06.21,"right now, here, hey, you run the show."
237,00:15:08.38,00:15:08.38,>> Yeah. >> You let them know.
238,00:15:13.75,00:15:13.75,">> You're the senior member of the tribe, buddy."
239,00:15:19.88,00:15:19.88,>> I'm the swing vote for both sides.
240,00:15:22.25,00:15:22.25,It's such a wonderful feeling to be in this power position
241,00:15:25.00,00:15:25.00,because I know I'm gonna go a lot further guaranteed.
242,00:15:29.46,00:15:29.46,I've thought out the best options of all the other nine
243,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,"players, and they know it. As much as I respect all of"
244,00:15:37.33,00:15:37.33,"them, this is a game now. Outwit, outlast, outplay"
245,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,everybody. (thunder crashes)
246,00:15:48.46,00:15:48.46,">> Come on, fire. >> Bruce and..."
247,00:16:13.00,00:16:13.00,>> Terry? >> And Terry.
248,00:16:15.17,00:16:15.17,I know. Damn. >> You know what...?
249,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,>> Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
250,00:16:22.83,00:16:22.83,">> What happened? >> You okay, Bruce?"
251,00:16:28.58,00:16:28.58,>> You all right? >> I cut my tooth.
252,00:16:30.58,00:16:30.58,">> Oh. >> We're building the shelter,"
253,00:16:32.08,00:16:32.08,"Bruce needed some rope cut, and I have the machete."
254,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,"It goes through the rope and hits him in the face, the sharp"
255,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,"end. Oh, my God, I'm sorry, Bruce."
256,00:16:40.92,00:16:40.92,"Neither of us were really thinking, I guess."
257,00:16:43.21,00:16:43.21,">> You chipped, you just chipped the top."
258,00:16:44.25,00:16:44.25,"The second tooth, the incisor. >> And that chipped a bit of his"
259,00:16:47.04,00:16:47.04,tooth and cut his lip. It was just a sickening sound.
260,00:16:51.04,00:16:51.04,"Initially, I'm, like, ""I'm gone."
261,00:16:53.04,00:16:53.04,"""I just hit Bruce in the face with a machete."
262,00:16:54.71,00:16:54.71,"I'm out of here."" >> You all right?"
263,00:16:56.12,00:16:56.12,>> He's going to need to get a stitch.
264,00:16:57.42,00:16:57.42,>> I got a machete in my mouth. >> You know what?
265,00:17:00.08,00:17:00.08,He may be on the DL for one day  and that's it.
266,00:17:02.83,00:17:02.83,"He'll be back. >> I am, I am not leaving this"
267,00:17:05.33,00:17:05.33,"game, let me tell you. >> Let's see."
268,00:17:06.71,00:17:06.71,>> It did leave him a big gash in his face.
269,00:17:09.21,00:17:09.21,"I mean, I panicked at first. I'm, like, panicking about"
270,00:17:11.54,00:17:11.54,numbers for a second for sure. >> You know what?
271,00:17:14.88,00:17:14.88,"You're out of the game for a day, you'll be right back."
272,00:17:16.83,00:17:16.83,"All right, right back. >> Stitch me, I'm cool."
273,00:17:19.25,00:17:19.25,I'll be here. I ain't leaving.
274,00:17:20.33,00:17:20.33,I ain't leaving you guys. I got too much to do with you
275,00:17:21.92,00:17:21.92,guys. Nick felt so bad.
276,00:17:23.62,00:17:23.62,"I mean, I just saw it in his face."
277,00:17:25.00,00:17:25.00,"He was in shock. He could have killed me, he"
278,00:17:27.29,00:17:27.29,"could have sliced my face open. >> You all right, buddy?"
279,00:17:31.12,00:17:31.12,">> I had a tooth come through my lip before, no biggie."
280,00:17:34.96,00:17:34.96,">> You are a tough son of a gun, man."
281,00:17:36.79,00:17:36.79,"(laughs) >> Psychologically, I want to"
282,00:17:38.96,00:17:38.96,"outwork them, I want to outperform them, and when it"
283,00:17:41.54,00:17:41.54,"comes to competition, I want to beat them all."
284,00:17:58.46,00:17:58.46,">> Our tribe name is Gitanos, which means ""Gypsy"" in Spanish,"
285,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,I believe. And since I'm an art teacher for
286,00:18:05.71,00:18:05.71,"34 years, I was designated to be the artist to create the flag."
287,00:18:11.04,00:18:11.04,And it took me a while to think of what kind of lettering I want
288,00:18:14.12,00:18:14.12,"to do, how to lay it out, what will stand out the best."
289,00:18:17.88,00:18:17.88,"I mean, I want our group to be proud of this banner, and I want"
290,00:18:21.25,00:18:21.25,"to do a great job for the group. Yeah, no question, yeah."
291,00:18:43.75,00:18:43.75,>> Straight up and down. >> I went off with Aras to
292,00:18:46.21,00:18:46.21,collect some firewood. I made some ambiguous chat about
293,00:18:49.04,00:18:49.04,"what's been going on at camp, because he and I did have a"
294,00:18:52.12,00:18:52.12,pretty good bond those days at Young Guy Beach.
295,00:18:56.08,00:18:56.08,">> Um, I mean I'm good with everybody."
296,00:18:58.58,00:18:58.58,There's no one I don't get along with.
297,00:19:06.25,00:19:06.25,>> The only thing that I learned was it was gonna be a lot harder
298,00:19:08.83,00:19:08.83,than I'd hoped to flip anybody over.
299,00:19:21.04,00:19:21.04,">> Okay, Shane... >> Cirie?"
300,00:19:29.92,00:19:29.92,">> Yeah, you and Cirie. It would be you, Cirie and us"
301,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"four, and then you wouldn't have to worry about anything for the"
302,00:19:35.88,00:19:35.88,next two weeks. Think that would be cool?
303,00:19:38.71,00:19:38.71,">> We can definitely try. Terry approached me and said,"
304,00:19:48.62,00:19:48.62,"""Here, you and Cirie, let's go right now, the six of us."""
305,00:19:51.38,00:19:51.38,"You know, I mean obviously it's desperation, but I mean, ""Why"
306,00:19:54.21,00:19:54.21,"would we want to join your tribe, homie?"
307,00:19:56.96,00:19:56.96,"""We're gonna ride this out and vote you off one at a time."
308,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,"There's no reason to flop."" He's grasping at straws and I"
309,00:20:02.38,00:20:02.38,get it. I would be doing the same thing.
310,00:20:05.62,00:20:05.62,">> I talked to Shane already, and our group of four would like"
311,00:20:09.21,00:20:09.21,to offer you and Shane the opportunity to take the burden
312,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,of Tribal Council off your shoulders for the next two
313,00:20:17.08,00:20:17.08,"weeks. >> Terry tells me that, um, I"
314,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,"mean, it was almost laughable. It was like he's offering me"
315,00:20:25.75,00:20:25.75,something. I don't think he's in the
316,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,position to offer me anything. >> Okay.
317,00:20:30.42,00:20:30.42,">> And if we can solidify this thing, that's even more time of"
318,00:20:32.58,00:20:32.58,worry-free life around here for the next couple of weeks.
319,00:20:34.88,00:20:34.88,">> Right. All right. Well, I'll get back to you."
320,00:20:38.17,00:20:38.17,>> All right. >> It was like a dictionary
321,00:20:39.12,00:20:39.12,"salesman. I mean, I already have an"
322,00:20:41.12,00:20:41.12,"encyclopedia collection here, and you want to sell me a"
323,00:20:44.38,00:20:44.38,dictionary? >> Am I in?
324,00:20:56.92,00:20:56.92,I don't even know what you're talking about.
325,00:21:02.33,00:21:02.33,>> I know there is. >> You want to live the next two
326,00:21:04.88,00:21:04.88,weeks burden-free? >> If you take a look at where
327,00:21:10.08,00:21:10.08,"we're at, we're in a really good spot if we just stay where"
328,00:21:12.50,00:21:12.50,"we are, you know? Maybe somebody will flop."
329,00:21:15.25,00:21:15.25,It's not going to be me. And I know it's not going to be
330,00:21:18.21,00:21:18.21,"her. I mean, getting to the merge"
331,00:21:20.29,00:21:20.29,with the numbers is the biggest part of the game.
332,00:21:23.17,00:21:23.17,"And I just know for me, I'm not flopping, so..."
333,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,Yeah. >> We were trying to sway Shane
334,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,"this morning, and that's not going to happen, not at all."
335,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,"In fact, he doesn't even want to talk about it."
336,00:21:35.42,00:21:35.42,"We're not sure about Cirie, and we're not sure about Bruce."
337,00:21:39.71,00:21:39.71,"So, even if we get one person, and it's five on five, it could"
338,00:21:42.21,00:21:42.21,be time to pull out the immunity idol that they don't
339,00:21:45.08,00:21:45.08,"know about. So, it could be my ace in the"
340,00:21:48.04,00:21:48.04,"hole for the rest of the game. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
341,00:22:11.54,00:22:11.54,"All right, so tell me about the merge."
342,00:22:14.29,00:22:14.29,"Nick, how did it go? >> The merge was great."
343,00:22:16.50,00:22:16.50,We were ecstatic over at La Mina to get the news.
344,00:22:19.29,00:22:19.29,It's been two days of love. The game was set aside for a
345,00:22:22.25,00:22:22.25,"day or so to get to know these people, and it's been amazing."
346,00:22:25.08,00:22:25.08,>> PROBST: You guys ready for today's challenge?
347,00:22:27.00,00:22:27.00,>> ALL: Yeah! >> PROBST: First things first.
348,00:22:30.29,00:22:30.29,"Take back the immunity idol. Thank you, Austin."
349,00:22:34.17,00:22:34.17,Tribal immunity is no more. This is what you covet now.
350,00:22:43.17,00:22:43.17,Individual immunity from here on out.
351,00:22:45.88,00:22:45.88,"If you have this immunity necklace around your neck,"
352,00:22:48.71,00:22:48.71,"you're safe at Tribal Council. If you don't, as you know, you"
353,00:22:52.29,00:22:52.29,could be going home. Very clear.
354,00:22:55.62,00:22:55.62,"Okay, let's get to today's immunity challenge."
355,00:22:58.50,00:22:58.50,It is a very simple test of endurance.
356,00:23:02.46,00:23:02.46,You are going to hang upside down with your arms and your
357,00:23:06.92,00:23:06.92,legs wrapped around a pole. You're going to hang there for
358,00:23:11.42,00:23:11.42,"as long as you can. You fall off the pole, you're"
359,00:23:14.46,00:23:14.46,out of the challenge. Last person left hanging wins
360,00:23:18.25,00:23:18.25,"immunity, is safe at tonight's Tribal Council."
361,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,"The other nine, somebody will be going home."
362,00:23:23.67,00:23:23.67,"Anything not clear? >> Pretty clear, Jeff."
363,00:23:27.54,00:23:27.54,>> PROBST: We've randomly drawn for spots.
364,00:23:29.46,00:23:29.46,"Take your spot, we'll get started."
365,00:23:34.50,00:23:34.50,"All right, everybody climb up your ladders."
366,00:23:44.38,00:23:44.38,"All right, get on. First individual immunity"
367,00:24:03.21,00:24:03.21,challenge is officially on. Hanging from arms and legs.
368,00:24:15.79,00:24:15.79,Don't drop headfirst if you drop.
369,00:24:33.29,00:24:33.29,"What's hurting already, Cirie? >> My arms... are hurting."
370,00:24:39.21,00:24:39.21,">> PROBST: Those arms are going to give, Cirie."

373,00:24:55.04,00:24:55.04,Very good chance that somebody hanging up there needs immunity
374,00:24:58.88,00:24:58.88,and doesn't know it. Been at it ten minutes.
375,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,And you start to feel your muscles cramp.

430,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,wants me to come over to that side.

440,00:30:52.71,00:30:52.71,"beaten Terry in the immunity challenge, so I went in knowing"
441,00:30:54.83,00:30:54.83,"that I was going to try to make myself look weak, so I was"
442,00:30:58.04,00:30:58.04,putting on an absolute Oscar-winning performance.
443,00:31:01.00,00:31:01.00,I was over there falling down and coming back up.
444,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,Thanks for allowing me the opportunity.
445,00:31:06.92,00:31:06.92,Praise Jesus. That was my plan was to show
446,00:31:10.21,00:31:10.21,that I wasn't that strong. But it doesn't matter what

451,00:31:27.08,00:31:27.08,"has immunity, the next two walking the plank are Austin and"
452,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,I. I really hope that I make it
453,00:31:32.96,00:31:32.96,"through this one more vote. It's a big, big night."

475,00:32:42.04,00:32:42.04,>> You didn't know the... >> The reason why we would want
476,00:32:44.29,00:32:44.29,to vote out Austin first were because we thought he was more
477,00:32:47.46,00:32:47.46,"of a physical threat than Nick, but, you know, I think everybody"
478,00:32:50.33,00:32:50.33,got all freaked out because Nick did well in the immunity

558,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,"We have our numbers, and we're going to stick true to them."
559,00:37:12.38,00:37:12.38,">> PROBST: Aras, a little worried that this is a very"
560,00:37:16.12,00:37:16.12,cocky group of six right now? >> I'm not worried about our
561,00:37:19.71,00:37:19.71,"confidence in the six. The whole thing of it is, is the"
562,00:37:24.17,00:37:24.17,"wrench is, is the immunity idol. There... It's still an immunity"
563,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,idol that could very well be in the hands of people who just
564,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,came to our beach. And so that is probably the only
565,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,thing that I'm worried about. >> PROBST: Would you be knocked
566,00:37:36.88,00:37:36.88,over if somebody flipped from your side tonight?
567,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,">> I'd be stunned. >> PROBST: So, Courtney, you're"
568,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,"pretty confident. >> Uh, I would be very shocked,"
569,00:37:45.25,00:37:45.25,"yes. >> PROBST: How about you, Cirie?"
570,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,">> Yeah, I would be, uh, flabbergasted."
571,00:37:51.88,00:37:51.88,"(laughter) >> PROBST: Okay, Terry has the"
572,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,immunity necklace. I doubt he's giving that up.
573,00:37:59.58,00:37:59.58,"In addition, several of you have been to Exile Island."
574,00:38:02.38,00:38:02.38,"If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you want to"
575,00:38:04.79,00:38:04.79,"use it, you'll let me know after the vote."
576,00:38:07.04,00:38:07.04,"It is time to vote. Nick, you're up."
577,00:38:22.08,00:38:22.08,">> Cool guy, man. Just voting for you 'cause you"
578,00:38:24.21,00:38:24.21,led the charge to get me out of here.
579,00:38:47.75,00:38:47.75,>> This makes me really sad. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
580,00:39:07.29,00:39:07.29,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
581,00:39:19.96,00:39:19.96,decision is final. The person voted out will be
582,00:39:21.75,00:39:21.75,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
583,00:39:23.88,00:39:23.88,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Shane."

595,00:40:31.12,00:40:31.12,"Exile Island, so unless somebody has given you the immunity idol,"
596,00:40:34.88,00:40:34.88,"you need to bring me your torch. Nick, the tribe has spoken."
597,00:41:01.62,00:41:01.62,Time for you to go. >> (whispers): Cirie.
598,00:41:07.08,00:41:07.08,">> (whispers): Nick. >> PROBST: Well, as day 18 comes"
