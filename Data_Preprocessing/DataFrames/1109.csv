374,00:22:32.33,00:22:32.33,I don't know if it was.I don't really think it was.
375,00:22:36.04,00:22:36.04,"And so, you know, I don't...I don't trust Jamie."

386,00:23:10.12,00:23:10.12,"vote for whoever they're votingfor tonight, just because it"
387,00:23:12.50,00:23:12.50,would be stupid for me to getthem any more mad at me than
388,00:23:15.04,00:23:15.04,there already are.And there's no breaking that
389,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,six.>> He's voting against me.

419,00:25:18.54,00:25:18.54,going to change your vote.Stephenie and Rafe could change
420,00:25:21.38,00:25:21.38,over to Bobby Jon and Danni'sside and Gary's side and they'd
421,00:25:24.42,00:25:24.42,have the numbers right now.>> I don't know why he did that.

561,00:34:54.42,00:34:54.42,"And she's going to get you guys,I'm telling you."
562,00:34:56.75,00:34:56.75,"They both looked at me and said,""You're not the one going home"
563,00:34:59.67,00:34:59.67,"tonight.""I said, ""All right."""
564,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,>> I think it's pretty amazingthat Judd told everybody the
565,00:35:32.62,00:35:32.62,"clue that it's on the ground,and I followed him back here and"
566,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,he's looking in the trees.That's pretty interesting.
567,00:35:40.04,00:35:40.04,"If it's on the ground, I wonderwhy he's looking in the trees."
568,00:35:44.12,00:35:44.12,There's no doubt in my mind thatJudd is lying.
569,00:35:47.12,00:35:47.12,I won't be looking on theground.
570,00:35:51.83,00:35:51.83,>> Where did Gary go?To search for the idol.
571,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,>> He went to find the idol.It would be amazing if he found
572,00:35:58.58,00:35:58.58,"it, amazing.Could you imagine?"
573,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,">> PROBST: So, Danni, this pointin the game, how big a factor"
574,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,"now does trust become?>> At this point, it gets kind"
575,00:36:40.42,00:36:40.42,of scary who you can trust andwho you can't.
576,00:36:42.92,00:36:42.92,And I'm worried because of thenumber game.
577,00:36:44.88,00:36:44.88,And I don't think obviously Ican trust anybody at this point.
578,00:36:47.88,00:36:47.88,My head is on the choppingblock.
579,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,"I hate that, but it's just partof the game."
580,00:36:52.79,00:36:52.79,">> PROBST: Rafe, do you agreewith that?"
581,00:36:54.75,00:36:54.75,">> Yeah, I think, you know,there's definitely a lot of"
582,00:36:57.33,00:36:57.33,paranoia around camp at thispoint in the game.
583,00:36:59.71,00:36:59.71,"You see two people go off andtalk, and you're like, ""What are"
584,00:37:02.29,00:37:02.29,they talking about?Are they talking about me?
585,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"Are they going to vote me off?""I think that's kind of running"
586,00:37:07.04,00:37:07.04,"through everyone's head.But at the same time, you have"
587,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,"to kind of keep your focus andnot let that drive you insane,"
588,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,"because it can in this game.>> PROBST: Gary, can you lie in"
589,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,the game of Survivor and not bebreaking any kind of moral code?
590,00:37:20.67,00:37:20.67,">> Well, I think each individuallooks at it differently, and"
591,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,there's no rule that says youcan't lie in this game.
592,00:37:26.83,00:37:26.83,It's just each individuallooking at what they want to do
593,00:37:29.62,00:37:29.62,and what they want to accomplishwith this game.
594,00:37:32.17,00:37:32.17,>> PROBST: Have you told anylies?
595,00:37:34.08,00:37:34.08,">> No.>> PROBST: Judd, you lied in"
596,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,"this game?>> No, sir, not yet."
597,00:37:40.96,00:37:40.96,"You know, it might happen, butas of this point in the game,"
598,00:37:43.75,00:37:43.75,"no, I haven't lied aboutanything yet."
599,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,">> PROBST: Cindy, you trustthese people?"
600,00:37:49.67,00:37:49.67,">> Actually, I trust thesepeople more than I expected."
601,00:37:52.46,00:37:52.46,"You spend time with them, youget to know these people, and"
602,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,"you can't help but develop somesort of trust in them, but I"
603,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,don't think it's possible to gothrough this game from beginning
604,00:38:01.12,00:38:01.12,to end and never lie to a singleperson about anything.
605,00:38:03.88,00:38:03.88,So I think we're all going to beliars before it's all over with.
606,00:38:07.00,00:38:07.00,">> PROBST: All right, before weget to the vote, a couple things"

611,00:38:19.50,00:38:19.50,"found the immunity idol andwants to use it tonight, now is"
612,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,"the time to bring it up.>> Oh, my God!"
