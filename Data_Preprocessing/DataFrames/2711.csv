186,00:11:21.57,00:11:21.57,>> I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO CIERA AND SHE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE
187,00:11:24.50,00:11:24.50,"WANTS WITH IT. WHETHER BURN IT, KEEP IT, SHARE"
188,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,"IT. >> ALL RIGHT, I THINK I'M GOING"
189,00:11:30.50,00:11:30.50,TO BURN IT. >> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN A CLUE
190,00:11:33.87,00:11:33.87,THAT COULD GIVE YOU SAFETY IN THIS GAME.
191,00:11:38.20,00:11:38.20,"THANKS, MOM. ALL RIGHT, LAURA, TINA,"
192,00:11:43.83,00:11:43.83,"CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE DAY 28."

198,00:12:21.83,00:12:21.83,VOTE AFTER THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT.
199,00:12:23.90,00:12:23.90,I HAVE TO GET PAST THIS NEXT VOTE SO THE WISEST THING I CAN
200,00:12:27.67,00:12:27.67,DO RIGHT NOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS KEEP EVERYBODY AGAINST KATIE.
201,00:12:35.83,00:12:35.83,>> HEY -- >> WE'RE GOOD.
202,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,>> KATIE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLAYER RIGHT NOW.
203,00:12:40.13,00:12:40.13,SHE HAS THREE JURY VOTES ALREADY.
204,00:12:41.83,00:12:41.83,THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF.
205,00:12:43.53,00:12:43.53,"SHE HAS ARAS, VYTAS' AND TINA'S VOTE RIGHT NOW."
206,00:12:47.07,00:12:47.07,>> SEALED? >> THAT'S ALMOST HALF THE VOTES.
207,00:12:49.20,00:12:49.20,WE CAN'T LET HER STICK AROUND. >> WE HAD THE FIVE-PERSON
208,00:12:52.13,00:12:52.13,"ALLIANCE, ME, CALEB, TYSON, GERVASE CIERA."
209,00:12:56.47,00:12:56.47,WE COULD CONTINUE ALONG THE COURSE OF THAT FIVE BY VOTING
210,00:12:59.23,00:12:59.23,OUT KATIE BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT WAITED TOO LONG
211,00:13:04.27,00:13:04.27,TO MAKE A MOVE AND GOT BLINDSIDED YOURSELF.
212,00:13:07.37,00:13:07.37,THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BE.
213,00:13:18.43,00:13:18.43,>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE UP TO US IF WE DON'T MAKE A MOVE.
214,00:13:21.77,00:13:21.77,WE CAN SIT ON OUR HANDS AND HOPE THINGS WORK OUT OR WE CAN KIND
215,00:13:24.87,00:13:24.87,"OF, LIKE, TRY AND TAKE ACTION AND DO OUR OWN THING."
216,00:13:28.90,00:13:28.90,>> KNOCK IT OUT. >> YEAH.

218,00:13:34.00,00:13:34.00,TYSON IS GOING TO BEAT US IN THE END.
219,00:13:35.80,00:13:35.80,>> HE'S BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE WHOLE GAME.
220,00:13:38.13,00:13:38.13,>> THE WHOLE THING. >> AND IN THE END IT'S A HUGE
221,00:13:41.10,00:13:41.10,PIECE TO THE PUZZLE. TYSON'S GOT A HELL OF A RESUME
222,00:13:45.23,00:13:45.23,TO PREACH TO THE JURY WHEN WE GET THERE.
223,00:13:46.90,00:13:46.90,SO WE'RE THINKING MAYBE BEFORE WE GET TO THE FINAL 5 WE'LL HAVE
224,00:13:50.60,00:13:50.60,TO PICK OFF SOMEBODY AND THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE TYSON.
225,00:13:56.23,00:13:56.23,>> YOU'RE SAFE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO TAKE TYSON OUT.
226,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,>> CALEB . >> WE'RE GONNA BLIND SIDE HIM.
227,00:14:05.23,00:14:05.23,>> CAN I TRUST YOU LIKE ONE MILLION PERCENT?
228,00:14:08.37,00:14:08.37,>> YES. >> I'VE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM THE
229,00:14:11.13,00:14:11.13,PAST FEW ABLE TOES. IT WASN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR ME.
230,00:14:13.50,00:14:13.50,I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE HER MET CRABS THAT WALK ALONG THE BEACH
231,00:14:19.03,00:14:19.03,AND YOU HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM HOME TO HOME AND YOU DON'T HAVE
232,00:14:22.83,00:14:22.83,A SHELL AND THERE'S PREDATORS. NOW I FEEL LOOK I'VE FOUND A
233,00:14:27.10,00:14:27.10,SHELL. MY BEST OPTION IS TO WORK WITH
234,00:14:28.80,00:14:28.80,MY ORIGINAL TADHANA MEMBERS AND GET RID OF TYSON SO I FEEL LIKE
235,00:14:32.97,00:14:32.97,MY OPTIONS ARE GETTING BETTER. >> BOYS!
236,00:14:39.30,00:14:39.30,>> GIRL! >> WELL?
237,00:14:41.70,00:14:41.70,">> WELL, WHAT'S NEW. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?"
238,00:14:45.00,00:14:45.00,>> WE'RE THINKING IT'S TIME TO SHAKE UP THE GAME A LITTLE BIT.
239,00:14:48.30,00:14:48.30,LIKE TYSON. >> OKAY.
240,00:14:50.73,00:14:50.73,>> RIGHT NOW WE COULD USE KATIE AS AN EXTRA TYSON VOTE.
241,00:14:55.63,00:14:55.63,>> SO THE FOUR OF US VOTE TYSON AND TYSON GOES HOME BECAUSE THE
242,00:14:59.63,00:14:59.63,FOUR OF JUST A MAJORITY. >> SMART.
243,00:15:02.47,00:15:02.47,US THREE FINAL THREE? >> ABSOLUTELY.
244,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,>> WE CAN SO OUTSTART THESE VETERANS RIGHT NOW.
245,00:15:09.00,00:15:09.00,CALEB SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE AND HE WANTED TYSON
246,00:15:11.60,00:15:11.60,GONE AND THAT REALLY THROWS ME OFF BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THESE
247,00:15:14.50,00:15:14.50,PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE ARE SO WILLING TO
248,00:15:17.53,00:15:17.53,FLIP AND FLOP ON EACH OTHER. IT'S TOO SKETCHY FOR ME TO
249,00:15:20.93,00:15:20.93,INVEST IN THEM. SO I TODAY CALEB AND HAYDEN WHAT
250,00:15:24.03,00:15:24.03,THEY WANTED TO HEAR BUT I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE
251,00:15:27.63,00:15:27.63,"THAT. >> AND I'M LIKE, IT DEPENDS."
252,00:15:37.23,00:15:37.23,AND HE GOES WE WANT TYSON GONE. BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS: I AM
253,00:15:41.10,00:15:41.10,"VOTING HOWEVER YOU'RE VOTING FROM HERE ON OUT, I'LL VOTE"
254,00:15:44.00,00:15:44.00,WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO VOTE. I DON'T WANT TO GO WITH THEM.
255,00:15:45.83,00:15:45.83,>> YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE AGAINST ME.
256,00:15:48.30,00:15:48.30,>> I TOTALLY KNOW. SO IF WE CAN JUST WORK TOGETHER
257,00:15:51.27,00:15:51.27,I HAVE YOUR BACK 100%. >> I HAVE YOURS AND I TOLD YOU
258,00:15:54.60,00:15:54.60,THAT FROM DAY ONE. >> BECAUSE I DO NOT TRUST THEM.
259,00:15:56.43,00:15:56.43,">> AND I DON'T, EITHER. I TRUST GERVASE AND MONICA."
260,00:16:01.03,00:16:01.03,WILL GO WITH US BECAUSE I'VE SHOWN HER MORE LOVE THAN ANYBODY
261,00:16:04.27,00:16:04.27,"ELSE HAS. SO THAT'S FOUR, WE GOT IT."
262,00:16:06.27,00:16:06.27,THEN WE'RE FLIPPING IT ON HAYDEN OR CALEB.
263,00:16:08.40,00:16:08.40,>> DEAL. >> I'M NERVOUS NOW.
264,00:16:10.70,00:16:10.70,I WAS HOPING TO MAKE IT TO SIX BEFORE I MADE MY MOVE AND LOCKED
265,00:16:13.63,00:16:13.63,THE GAME DOWN BUT I MAY HAVE TO LOCK IT DOWN EARLIER.
266,00:16:16.37,00:16:16.37,I TRUST MONICA AND I TRUST GERVASE.
267,00:16:19.77,00:16:19.77,CIERA IS THE MAJOR WILD CARD HERE.
268,00:16:21.57,00:16:21.57,I HOPE CIERA IS TELLING THE TRUTH BUT IN THE END IT MAKES
269,00:16:24.37,00:16:24.37,MORE SENSE FOR ME TO GO THAT DIRECTION ANYWAYS BECAUSE I NEED
270,00:16:27.67,00:16:27.67,CALEB AND HAYDEN OUT AND THE SOONER THE BETTER.
271,00:16:38.90,00:16:38.90,>> LISTEN TO THIS: CIERA TOLD ME THEY'RE PLANNING TO VOTE ME OUT.
272,00:16:46.97,00:16:46.97,"SHE SAID CALEB CAME UP AND SAID ""YOU READY FOR A BIG MOVE?"
273,00:16:50.20,00:16:50.20,"WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, TYSON."" SHE SAID SHE TRUSTED ME ENOUGH"
274,00:16:54.33,00:16:54.33,THAT ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TELL HER WHO TO VOTE FOR AND SHE WILL
275,00:16:57.70,00:16:57.70,VOTE WITH ME EVERY SINGLE VOTE UNTIL THE END.
276,00:17:05.07,00:17:05.07,>> SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF CALEB?
277,00:17:07.67,00:17:07.67,>> YEAH. HE'S SO LIKABLE.
278,00:17:09.50,00:17:09.50,HE'S THE CLEAR SHOT AT THE MILLION.
279,00:17:11.37,00:17:11.37,>> CIERA SAYS THAT CALEB AND HAYDEN ARE TARGETING TYSON AND
280,00:17:14.60,00:17:14.60,ARE GOING TO TRY TO VOTE HIM OUT.
281,00:17:16.40,00:17:16.40,"SO NOW WE'RE THINKING OKAY, WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THEM."
282,00:17:19.37,00:17:19.37,"TWO DAYS AGO THE FOUR GUYS, WE HAD CONTROL OF THE GAME."
283,00:17:22.73,00:17:22.73,BUT NOW WE'RE ALL PLOTTING ON EACH OTHER AND IT MAKES ME
284,00:17:26.97,00:17:26.97,NERVOUS. BUT AS LONG AS CIERA JUST STICKS
285,00:17:29.00,00:17:29.00,WITH US WE SHOULD BE GOOD. >> SNEAKY BASTARDS.
286,00:17:32.60,00:17:32.60,>> I KNOW. I REALLY TRUSTED THEM.
287,00:17:34.63,00:17:34.63,I WAS READY TO GO TO THE FINAL FOUR WITH THEM.
288,00:17:37.23,00:17:37.23,>> HAYDEN AND CALEB ARE TRYING TO STIR THE POT AND THEY JUST
289,00:17:40.90,00:17:40.90,GOT SLOPPY. AND WHEN YOU BREAK YOUR ALLIANCE
290,00:17:43.53,00:17:43.53,LIKE THAT THE GLOVES COME OFF AND IT'S GONNA GET REAL DIRTY
291,00:17:47.07,00:17:47.07,AND UGLY. TOMORROW'S GONNA BE HUGE.
292,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,>> YEAH. >> GOOD MORNING!

296,00:18:27.13,00:18:27.13,>> OKAY. >> WE'LL BE BACK.
297,00:18:29.80,00:18:29.80,BYE. >> SHE WALKED RIGHT BY HERE AND
298,00:18:33.83,00:18:33.83,DIDN'T SAY A WORD. >> SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME IN
299,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13,THE EYE. CIERA.
300,00:18:37.50,00:18:37.50,">> ME, EITHER. >> LET'S SEE."

306,00:18:55.97,00:18:55.97,"BOARD, ME AND GERVASE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT."
307,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,WE'RE GONNA DO IT. STRAIGHT TO THE FINALS.
308,00:19:01.10,00:19:01.10,>> STRAIGHT TO THE FINALS. >> I'M SO I DIDN'T GO ALONG WITH
309,00:19:04.97,00:19:04.97,HAYDEN AND CALEB. I FEEL LIKE I MADE THE RIGHT
310,00:19:07.57,00:19:07.57,"DECISION AND I TRUST TYSON BECAUSE TYSON KNOWS, A, THEY'RE"
311,00:19:11.60,00:19:11.60,"GUNNING FOR HIM. B, I SAVED HIM AND, C, HE"
312,00:19:14.33,00:19:14.33,DOESN'T WANT TO BE SITTING NEXT TO THEM AT THE END ANYWAY.
313,00:19:17.00,00:19:17.00,SO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD SPOT COME NEXT TRIBAL.
314,00:19:20.67,00:19:20.67,TRIBAL. OKAY.
315,00:19:22.97,00:19:22.97,"""ARE YOU ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY? DO YOU HAVE A GRIP ON THIS GAME?"
316,00:19:27.13,00:19:27.13,YOU'D BETTER HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE OR TONIGHT YOU COULD LOSE
317,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,"YOUR FLAME."" >> OOH!"
318,00:19:33.87,00:19:33.87,WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> THIS MORNING I SAW CIERA AND
319,00:19:37.53,00:19:37.53,"TYSON RUN OFF INTO THE WOODS THEN I STARTED THINKING, YOU"
320,00:19:40.33,00:19:40.33,"KNOW WHAT? WHAT IF CIERA TELLS TYSON, HEY,"
321,00:19:44.13,00:19:44.13,THOSE GUYS ARE GOING TO BLIND SIDE YOU.
322,00:19:45.97,00:19:45.97,AND I STARTED TO GET PARANOID BECAUSE I REALIZE IF CIERA
323,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,FLIPPED WE COULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.
324,00:19:51.73,00:19:51.73,">> SO WE'RE GOING TYSON, RIGHT? >> WE ARE, THAT'S --"
325,00:19:54.90,00:19:54.90,>> THAT'S THE PLAN. >> YEAH.
326,00:19:59.83,00:19:59.83,BUT WHEN THEY LEFT THEY WERE KIND OF LOOKING OUT OUR
327,00:20:02.57,00:20:02.57,DIRECTION. >> IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.
328,00:20:04.13,00:20:04.13,">> YEAH, ME, TOO. >> WHY IS SHE SO CHUMMY WITH"
329,00:20:07.63,00:20:07.63,TYSON? >> I DON'T KNOW.

331,00:20:11.53,00:20:11.53,>> I THINK POTENTIALLY. >> BECAUSE IF SO THEN ONE OF YOU
332,00:20:16.30,00:20:16.30,COULD BLIND SIDE HER INTO GOING -- IF WE DON'T HAVE HER VOTE.
333,00:20:20.33,00:20:20.33,I THOUGHT VOTING TYSON WAS THE BEST OPTION AND IT WAS GOING TO
334,00:20:22.97,00:20:22.97,BE SMOOTH SAILING BUT NOW THAT THERE'S SUSPICION ABOUT CIERA
335,00:20:26.40,00:20:26.40,"THERE MAY HAVE TO BE A PLAN ""B."" >> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT"
336,00:20:29.63,00:20:29.63,WE'RE IN THE MAJORITY. >> I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT
337,00:20:32.87,00:20:32.87,EVERYTHING'S ALL UP IN THE AIR AND NO ONE IS SAFE SO THIS
338,00:20:35.63,00:20:35.63,CHALLENGE IS HUGE. AND IF CIERA DOESN'T WIN
339,00:20:39.23,00:20:39.23,IMMUNITY SHE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

347,00:21:25.93,00:21:25.93,"AS THE CHALLENGE GOES ON, YOU'LL BE UNABLE TO BEAR THAT WEIGHT,"
348,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,"THE ROPE WILL UNSPOOL, THE BUCKET WILL DROP, YOU'RE OUT OF"
349,00:21:34.27,00:21:34.27,THE CHALLENGE. LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

353,00:21:49.47,00:21:49.47,"IF, AFTER 29 DAYS, YOU FEEL SO SECURE THAT YOU DON'T NEED"
354,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,IMMUNITY TONIGHT YOU CAN SIT IT OUT AND FEAST.

519,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,GIRL AND I KNOW SHE'S A GOOD LIAR.
520,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00,IN HER MIND SHE'S PROBABLY THINKING BY PITTING THE GUYS
521,00:32:44.90,00:32:44.90,AGAINST EACH OTHER SHE CAN STICK AROUND A LITTLE LONGER AND THAT
522,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,WAS A SMART MOVE ON HER PART. BUT NOW I'M FEELING LIKE SHE'S
523,00:32:52.03,00:32:52.03,TOO SNEAKY AND TOO SMART AND TOO DECEIVING TO BE IN THE GAME
524,00:32:56.63,00:32:56.63,ANYMORE. >> IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.

530,00:33:10.33,00:33:10.33,THEY COULD BE TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE AND THEN POW I
531,00:33:14.67,00:33:14.67,GET HIT WITH A HEART BREAKER. SO I MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY MY
532,00:33:22.10,00:33:22.10,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. IT'S THAT LITTLE ADDED BIT OF
533,00:33:25.03,00:33:25.03,INSURANCE IN CASE SOMETHING SCREWY HAPPENS.

537,00:33:40.40,00:33:40.40,IT 100%. HAYDEN FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE
538,00:33:42.00,00:33:42.00,WITH IT THAN I DO. I'M CITY THINKING IS HE STILL
539,00:33:45.07,00:33:45.07,PLAYING US? IS HE PLANNING SOMETHING?
540,00:33:46.53,00:33:46.53,IS HE NOT. >> SHE HAS NO IDEA.
