399,00:27:20.80,00:27:20.80,I THINK IT'S SACK RELIGIOUS NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN IMMUNITY
400,00:27:28.27,00:27:28.27,"CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY AND I HAVE LIONS AND GORILLAS TATTOOED ON"
401,00:27:32.43,00:27:32.43,"YOUR BODY. COME ON, MAN."

407,00:27:48.23,00:27:48.23,THE FINAL THREE. AND IF THESE PEOPLE AREN'T
408,00:27:50.90,00:27:50.90,"BITTER, I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT OF WINNING."
409,00:27:53.37,00:27:53.37,>> HERE'S MY PLAN SO THAT YOU KNOW.
410,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,WE'RE GONNA SPLIT THE VOTES. ONE OF THE BEAUTEZ OF BEING
411,00:27:59.97,00:27:59.97,"NUMBERS OF 7-3, IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER."
412,00:28:04.03,00:28:04.03,"MALCOLM CAN HAVE AN IDOL, AND IT WOULD BE FOUR MALCOLM, THREE"
413,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,EDDIE. SO ONE OF THOSE TWO ARE GOING TO
414,00:28:10.57,00:28:10.57,GO HOME. MALCOLM DISTRIBUTE HAVE AN IDOL.
415,00:28:13.20,00:28:13.20,SO HE'S SITTING THERE ( WHISTLING )
416,00:28:18.47,00:28:18.47,AND BYE-BYE. >> MY HEAD IN THE GUILLOTINE
417,00:28:29.83,00:28:29.83,"RIGHT NOW, BUT THE IDEA NOW IS I HAVE THE IDOL."
418,00:28:32.27,00:28:32.27,"NO MATTER WHAT. I PLAY THAT THING, I'M NOT GOING"
419,00:28:35.67,00:28:35.67,HOME. BUT THE IDEA IS TO GET THROUGH
420,00:28:37.57,00:28:37.57,THIS VOTE AND STILL HAVE THE IDOL.
421,00:28:40.23,00:28:40.23,I HAVE A FEELING THAT WE'VE JUST MISSED.
422,00:28:43.60,00:28:43.60,">> I'M ALL FOR LOOKING FOR IDOLS, DUDE."
423,00:28:47.53,00:28:47.53,>> I'M CONVINCED IT'S ON THIS PATH.

429,00:29:05.17,00:29:05.17,AND THEY HAD ONE OF THOSE THINGS-- SO I THINK-- I THINK
430,00:29:07.70,00:29:07.70,THE HOTTEST PLACE FOR THE IDOL IS THE INTROONS TO THE WATER.
431,00:29:11.37,00:29:11.37,">> GRAY. >> AFTER THE CHALLENGE, ANDREA"
432,00:29:14.03,00:29:14.03,IS LIKE LET'S LOOK FOR THE IDOL AND I SAY ABSOLUTELY.

434,00:29:18.93,00:29:18.93,I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE SIT AROUND SO MUCH AT CAMP.
435,00:29:21.60,00:29:21.60,"THERE'S A MILLION DOLLARS. >> SO IT WAS, LIKE... LIKE, NOT"
436,00:29:25.97,00:29:25.97,"FUN. >> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO"

442,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,>> WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH FOR A CLUE?
443,00:30:04.57,00:30:04.57,>> YOU KNOW WHAT? >> WHAT?
444,00:30:07.50,00:30:07.50,>> YOU SAID THAT. >> YOU JUST FOUND IT.

449,00:30:31.47,00:30:31.47,IMMUNITYITE IDOL RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.
450,00:30:32.77,00:30:32.77,">> MALCOLM, WAY TO GO. GOOD FOR YOU."
451,00:30:36.87,00:30:36.87,">> MALCOLM WAS SUPPOSED TO GO HOME, BUT HE FOUND THE HIDDEN"

453,00:30:43.43,00:30:43.43,SO EDDIE HAS TO GO NOW. MALCOLM JUT FOUND THE IDOL.
454,00:30:49.70,00:30:49.70,">> IN FRONT OF YOU? >> YEAH, WE WERE RIGHT BY HIM."

464,00:31:29.43,00:31:29.43,AND REYNOLD WON IMMUNITY. NOW I'M DOUBLE SCREWED BECAUSE
465,00:31:32.53,00:31:32.53,MY ONLY CHANCE FOR STAYING ANOTHER DAY WAS IF THEY DECIDED
466,00:31:35.07,00:31:35.07,TO VOTE OFF MALCOLM INSTEAD OF ME.
467,00:31:37.03,00:31:37.03,ASK NOW THE ENTIRE CAMP KNOWS HE HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

493,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,>> PROBABLY REYNOLD. HE'S THE SORT OF GUY WHO CAN
494,00:33:20.67,00:33:20.67,CHARM HIS WAY TO THE TOP. HE WON IMMUNITY SO I THINK
495,00:33:23.77,00:33:23.77,"EVERYBODY VIEWS HIM AS A HUGE, HUGE THREAT."

554,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,WE'RE ALL IN BASIC TRAINING. >> THAT IS NOT HOW I PLAY THE
555,00:36:32.97,00:36:32.97,GAME. HE IS TRYING TO LABEL ME AS
556,00:36:35.67,00:36:35.67,"SOMETHING I'M NOT. >> Jeff: WOW, SO, WHERE ARE"

568,00:37:10.77,00:37:10.77,TO PLAY THEM. BUT THERE IS SOME BONUS IN
569,00:37:12.87,00:37:12.87,KEEPING ONE IDOL. IF ONE PERSON DECIDES NOT TO
570,00:37:16.20,00:37:16.20,"PLAY IT. >> Jeff: PHILLIP, YET A NEW"
571,00:37:20.67,00:37:20.67,WRINKLE. THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WEARING
572,00:37:22.37,00:37:22.37,THEM MEANS NOTHING. THEY NEED TO GIVE THEM TO US.
573,00:37:25.57,00:37:25.57,>> I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE THE WAY WE SAID WE WOULD VOTE WHEN
574,00:37:30.17,00:37:30.17,"WE CAME IN HERE. FIHAVE TO GO HOME, I HAVE TO GO"
575,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,HOME. BUT I'D RATHER DO IT
576,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,STRATEGICALLY THAN MALIGN MY CHARACTER.
577,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,">> Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU HAVE WRITTEN PAPERS ABOUT SURVIVOR"
578,00:37:44.03,00:37:44.03,>> I'M HAVING A BIPOLAR REACTION.

582,00:37:59.60,00:37:59.60,EXTREMELY RARE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A GAMBLE.
583,00:38:01.90,00:38:01.90,>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT IT IS ABOUT TAKING OUT ONE OF THE
584,00:38:04.80,00:38:04.80,OTHER SIX AND THEY'RE SHOVING EVERYTHING TOWARDS PHILLIPS IS A
585,00:38:08.80,00:38:08.80,MISDIRECT. >> I THINK IT JUST TAKES A

587,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,ALLIANCE THAT'S NOT PHILLIP. >> Jeff: SO THE QUESTIONS AS
588,00:38:17.37,00:38:17.37,WE GO TO THE VOTE ARE WHO ARE THE THREE AMIGOS GOING TO VOTE
589,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,FOR? WHO ARE THE SEVEN GOING TO VOTE
590,00:38:22.60,00:38:22.60,FOR? AND ARE EDDIE AND MALCOLM GOING
591,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,TO PLAY THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IDOLS?
