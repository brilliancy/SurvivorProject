2,00:00:02.30,00:00:02.30,Survivor: Merge was on everyone's mind
3,00:00:04.10,00:00:04.10,when the tribes received body paint with tree mail.
4,00:00:06.93,00:00:06.93,">> If I was a betting woman, and I was in Las Vegas,"
5,00:00:08.93,00:00:08.93,I'd say we're merging. >> PROBST: But the merge
6,00:00:10.97,00:00:10.97,never materialized. Reach in and pick a buff.
7,00:00:12.93,00:00:12.93,"You're now a member of Chapera. Instead, everybody drew buffs to"
8,00:00:16.53,00:00:16.53,"randomly mix up the tribes. What, did you think we were"
9,00:00:19.23,00:00:19.23,merging? Just switching things up.
10,00:00:21.70,00:00:21.70,"Against all odds, the tribes stayed intact, merely changing"
11,00:00:25.10,00:00:25.10,"names, with one exception. Amber-- the only one to change"
12,00:00:28.40,00:00:28.40,tribes. >> I definitely feel like
13,00:00:30.53,00:00:30.53,I'm the only one who got screwed in this whole situation.
14,00:00:32.57,00:00:32.57,>> PROBST: The new Chapera tribe lived it up at their new beach.
15,00:00:35.73,00:00:35.73,>> I realized immediately that we were so much better off
16,00:00:37.90,00:00:37.90,over here. >> PROBST: But the new Mogo Mogo
17,00:00:40.57,00:00:40.57,tribe felt their new home was less that adequate.
18,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,>> It's a crap camp. >> PROBST: While his tribemates
19,00:00:45.70,00:00:45.70,"missed their old camp, Rob just missed Amber."
20,00:00:48.07,00:00:48.07,>> It kills me to have her over there by herself.
21,00:00:50.07,00:00:50.07,>> PROBST: The Immunity Challenge tested the tribe's
22,00:00:52.67,00:00:52.67,knowledge of Survivor history. Mogo Mogo is right.
23,00:00:55.23,00:00:55.23,"You win immunity. And, in a bold move, Boston Rob"
24,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73,offered Lex a deal if he would save Amber.
25,00:01:00.97,00:01:00.97,"Before Tribal Council, Amber was aware she was the obvious"
26,00:01:04.97,00:01:04.97,"target, and tried to turn the heat on Jerri."
27,00:01:09.07,00:01:09.07,">> Please, Kathy, keep me in the game."
28,00:01:11.53,00:01:11.53,Vote for Jerri. >> PROBST: And Jerri went after
29,00:01:13.70,00:01:13.70,"Amber, the outsider. >> Boston Rob will tell"
30,00:01:16.07,00:01:16.07,you anything to keep Amber around.

32,00:01:20.40,00:01:20.40,"making really hard decisions. >> PROBST: And, at Tribal"
33,00:01:22.73,00:01:22.73,"Council, Lex and Kathy took a gamble on Rob's future loyalty,"
34,00:01:26.00,00:01:26.00,"and voted Jerri out of the game. Jerri, the tribe has spoken."
35,00:01:29.60,00:01:29.60,Nine all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

39,00:03:20.43,00:03:20.43,last night at Tribal Council was horrible.
40,00:03:24.13,00:03:24.13,I cut her loose to keep Amber around as a favor to Rob.
41,00:03:28.80,00:03:28.80,"When I need to cash in with Rob, I'm sure he'll deliver."
42,00:03:32.13,00:03:32.13,"He's good on his word. >> We think that Amber's gone,"
43,00:03:48.17,00:03:48.17,and it was a very somber mood around camp.
44,00:03:53.27,00:03:53.27,Rob is really sad. That was not only his strong
45,00:03:56.73,00:03:56.73,"alliance, but, I mean, they're really dating out here."
46,00:04:05.83,00:04:05.83,>> I hope Amber is still here. I said some prayers last night
47,00:04:10.77,00:04:10.77,and this morning. Not much I can do about it.
48,00:04:12.80,00:04:12.80,"Maybe Lex came through for me, and that would be great. Ahh!"
49,00:04:17.03,00:04:17.03,">> I've never seen Rob all screwed up like this, but"
50,00:04:21.50,00:04:21.50,"it's like when a calf's sucking its mama's titty and, when you"
51,00:04:26.93,00:04:26.93,"wean that calf, it bawls, and it'll go crazy."
52,00:04:30.00,00:04:30.00,It tries to go through fences and bushes...
53,00:04:32.50,00:04:32.50,Rob's the same way. And it'll take about three days
54,00:04:36.03,00:04:36.03,to get a calf weaned from its mother.
55,00:04:39.17,00:04:39.17,A human is about the same. >> This situation throws
56,00:04:44.83,00:04:44.83,you into a weird kind of arena where you never know who is
57,00:04:48.43,00:04:48.43,going to be your ally. You may think one person is
58,00:04:51.13,00:04:51.13,"perfect to align with, and then, all of a sudden, you're, like,"
59,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,"what the hell happened, you know?"
60,00:04:57.33,00:04:57.33,">> We can have, like, a little silent alliance going."
61,00:05:02.07,00:05:02.07,"You know, kind of cover your tracks and be ready."
62,00:05:05.90,00:05:05.90,You know what I mean? >> Mm-hmm.
63,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,>> I'll be completely alone in this game if Amber is
64,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,gone. I can't trust anybody.
65,00:05:14.07,00:05:14.07,"I kind of have a mark on my back, so I got to watch both"
66,00:05:18.83,00:05:18.83,shoulders at all times. >> I promise you right
67,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,now. >> Okay.
68,00:05:23.33,00:05:23.33,>> Here's the thing. >> If it comes down to it...
69,00:05:25.60,00:05:25.60,">> If we have... >> I promise you, I will"
70,00:05:27.60,00:05:27.60,fight for you. >> I will never write
71,00:05:28.87,00:05:28.87,your name down. >> All right.
72,00:05:29.97,00:05:29.97,>> I will never... >> I promise you.
73,00:05:31.43,00:05:31.43,>> ...write your name down. >> I will never write
74,00:05:33.43,00:05:33.43,your name down. >> That's it.
75,00:05:34.90,00:05:34.90,I won't write your name down. There's no way.
76,00:05:36.67,00:05:36.67,I would never screw you over. I'm not going to say that.
77,00:05:38.90,00:05:38.90,">> I didn't say that to anybody in this game, Alicia."
78,00:05:40.90,00:05:40.90,I did not say that to any one person in this came.
79,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,>> Neither did I. >> Okay.
80,00:05:59.47,00:05:59.47,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Chapera, come on in!"
81,00:06:13.57,00:06:13.57,(Jenna L. squeals) >> She made it.

83,00:06:18.53,00:06:18.53,"Remaining tribe members: Kathy, Shii Ann, Lex and Amber."
84,00:06:22.60,00:06:22.60,">> Hi, guys. >> Hey."
85,00:06:25.57,00:06:25.57,">> What's up, Kat? >> Hey."
86,00:06:26.97,00:06:26.97,>> PROBST: Okay. Let's get to today's Reward
87,00:06:29.43,00:06:29.43,Challenge. Even though you are still two
88,00:06:32.40,00:06:32.40,"tribes, it is an individual Reward Challenge."
89,00:06:37.07,00:06:37.07,Here's how it's going to work. All nine of you will start out
90,00:06:40.10,00:06:40.10,"on the floating platform. On my go, all nine of you will"
91,00:06:42.83,00:06:42.83,dive down and retrieve one of seven pots.
92,00:06:45.63,00:06:45.63,Two without a pot will be eliminated.
93,00:06:48.30,00:06:48.30,We'll work our way from nine tribe members to seven to five

95,00:06:53.63,00:06:53.63,We'll then move to a final round.

194,00:14:20.63,00:14:20.63,>> Mm-hmm. >> Do you do the deep
195,00:14:24.23,00:14:24.23,moisturizing treatment frizz down before conditioner or
196,00:14:27.03,00:14:27.03,after? >> Before.
197,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57,>> Before? Thank you. >> I've never felt so girly.
198,00:14:32.70,00:14:32.70,We each get our own Fantastic Lash.
199,00:14:34.70,00:14:34.70,"That's the kind I use at home, Aqua Smooth."
200,00:14:36.70,00:14:36.70,>> Really? >> Mm-hmm. I wanted to paint my
201,00:14:39.23,00:14:39.23,"toenails, I wanted to smell good, I wanted to be pretty."
202,00:14:42.20,00:14:42.20,>> My lips haven't felt this smooth for so long.
203,00:14:44.40,00:14:44.40,>> I'm the least girly girl ever.
204,00:14:46.43,00:14:46.43,"I've never even had a massage or a facial, but after 25 days of"
205,00:14:50.87,00:14:50.87,not caring it felt good to care. >> Just feels so good.
206,00:14:58.30,00:14:58.30,>> I'm going to go back there Superman.
207,00:15:01.30,00:15:01.30,(chuckling) I can do the last 13 days
208,00:15:06.23,00:15:06.23,standing on my head. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
209,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,>> I sat down to dinner with Amber and Jenna who were
210,00:15:20.73,00:15:20.73,"dolled up to the nines, beautiful lips."
211,00:15:24.40,00:15:24.40,I wanted to kiss and hug 'em all over.
212,00:15:27.00,00:15:27.00,>> To being clean and feeling brand-new.
213,00:15:30.47,00:15:30.47,">> Brand-new. >> Oh, my God, energized"
214,00:15:32.23,00:15:32.23,"and ready for 13 days. No matter how it turns out, when"
215,00:15:36.37,00:15:36.37,"we get home, I have wholehearted faith in Amber and Rob and Jenna"
216,00:15:40.77,00:15:40.77,"and Big Tom and I. Five strong, solid..."
217,00:15:45.27,00:15:45.27,>> And we have this. I really strongly believe we
218,00:15:48.40,00:15:48.40,have this. >> I think so.
219,00:15:50.10,00:15:50.10,We have a five-way strong no matter what happens.
220,00:15:52.73,00:15:52.73,>> ...happens. We do. >> I was a little nervous
221,00:16:00.13,00:16:00.13,because I made a deal with Lex and Kathy that they could come
222,00:16:04.10,00:16:04.10,"to the end with me, Big Tom and Rob."
223,00:16:06.60,00:16:06.60,But I couldn't tell Rupert and Jenna that.
224,00:16:09.47,00:16:09.47,>> We'll be the powerhouse. >> Cheers to that.
225,00:16:12.27,00:16:12.27,">> I know, my God. (chuckling)"
226,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,"It's very good, very good. >> We've got mail."

244,00:17:48.60,00:17:48.60,A couple of you may realize we are on the former Saboga
245,00:17:51.33,00:17:51.33,tribe's beach. That's because the game is about
246,00:17:54.10,00:17:54.10,to change again. Drop your buffs.
247,00:17:57.03,00:17:57.03,>> Here we go. >> Here we go again.

249,00:18:04.13,00:18:04.13,for new buffs. >> I hope it's a new color
250,00:18:06.37,00:18:06.37,we see coming out of there. >> PROBST: Boston Rob.
251,00:18:08.93,00:18:08.93,">> No green, no red. >> PROBST: This time the buff..."
252,00:18:11.30,00:18:11.30,(cheering) it is the merge color.
253,00:18:15.53,00:18:15.53,(cheering) (Rupert laughing)
254,00:18:25.90,00:18:25.90,>> Try it on. (cheering and laughing)
255,00:18:30.63,00:18:30.63,>> We love this. >> This is a great color.
256,00:18:32.80,00:18:32.80,Didn't like that green. >> Thank you.
257,00:18:36.07,00:18:36.07,>> PROBST: All right. Here's how the merge is going to
258,00:18:38.03,00:18:38.03,work. You will not be returning to
259,00:18:39.93,00:18:39.93,Chapera. You will not be returning to
260,00:18:42.37,00:18:42.37,Mogo Mogo. You will live your remaining
261,00:18:44.60,00:18:44.60,days right here on Saboga beach. The beach is a little different
262,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,"from when you last left it, Rupert and Jenna."
263,00:18:52.57,00:18:52.57,"Strong tides, heavy storms pretty much wiped away your"
264,00:18:56.00,00:18:56.00,shelter. >> Yes.
265,00:18:57.57,00:18:57.57,>> PROBST: The timber's still here.
266,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,Your toolbox is still here. You've got plenty of nails and
267,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,rope and wire. Some of your pots are scattered
268,00:19:04.37,00:19:04.37,around here. You're going to have to
269,00:19:05.80,00:19:05.80,"scavenge, you're gonna have to find this stuff, but you can"
270,00:19:07.87,00:19:07.87,build shelter again. You've got Boston Rob who's
271,00:19:10.73,00:19:10.73,proven he knows what he's doing. And because you guys have shown
272,00:19:14.27,00:19:14.27,"that you can survive out here 26 days, we figure you do deserve a"
273,00:19:19.30,00:19:19.30,little bit of a housewarming gift.
274,00:19:21.77,00:19:21.77,In keeping with Survivor: All-Stars...
275,00:19:24.43,00:19:24.43,">> Oh...! What? >> Oh, my gosh."
276,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47,>> PROBST: We have a few items to help you out with your new

279,00:19:35.30,00:19:35.30,paints for your new tribe flag. You'll need to come up a new
280,00:19:38.13,00:19:38.13,tribe name. >> Yay!
281,00:19:39.93,00:19:39.93,>> PROBST: The day is already half over.
282,00:19:42.10,00:19:42.10,Storms can come in at any time. This is your new home.
283,00:19:45.30,00:19:45.30,Get to work. >> Yes!
284,00:19:48.30,00:19:48.30,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> We have Chapera, Mogo"
285,00:20:06.97,00:20:06.97,Mogo and Saboga. >> Right.
286,00:20:10.10,00:20:10.10,So how about... >> Sapera Mogo.
287,00:20:13.83,00:20:13.83,I kind of like Bogamopera. Boga... mo... pera.
288,00:20:18.63,00:20:18.63,">> Hey, you guys? What do you think of Bogamopera?"
289,00:20:22.23,00:20:22.23,"That's all of us combined, all the tribes."
290,00:20:24.37,00:20:24.37,>> It's not bad. >> How about Chaboga Mogo?
291,00:20:26.53,00:20:26.53,>> Chaboga Mogo... >> Sounds like a dance.
292,00:20:28.27,00:20:28.27,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Chaboga Mogo Chaboga Mogo \xe2\x99\xaa
293,00:20:33.47,00:20:33.47,>> Let's do it. I love it! >> I'm thrilled to be
294,00:20:36.70,00:20:36.70,"merged, if for no other reason just because now the game has"
295,00:20:39.57,00:20:39.57,changed up. This is where it gets exciting
296,00:20:42.97,00:20:42.97,for a game player like me who just enjoys playing the game of
297,00:20:45.63,00:20:45.63,"Survivor. >> As soon as we merged,"
298,00:20:50.60,00:20:50.60,"Lex comes running over to me, ""Rob, make me feel comfortable."
299,00:20:55.37,00:20:55.37,"Tell me that I'm safe. Tell me that I'm safe."""
300,00:20:58.70,00:20:58.70,"I will do everything I can, and you got other friends in the"
301,00:21:02.50,00:21:02.50,"game, too. Yeah. You know what I mean?"
302,00:21:05.93,00:21:05.93,">> Yep. >> I'm making the deal,"
303,00:21:10.07,00:21:10.07,"""Save Amber and I'm going to help you later on."""
304,00:21:13.70,00:21:13.70,"You guys didn't really believe that, did you?"
305,00:21:16.93,00:21:16.93,"Come on! >> If I get a sense that,"
306,00:21:20.53,00:21:20.53,"you know, I'm going to end up getting, you know, double-"
307,00:21:23.07,00:21:23.07,"crossed, get a knife in my back next Tribal Council, I certainly"
308,00:21:25.70,00:21:25.70,won't be happy about that. >> I won't stick a knife in
309,00:21:28.13,00:21:28.13,"your back, man. I ain't gonna do that."
310,00:21:31.17,00:21:31.17,>> All right. >> I haven't played that
311,00:21:32.50,00:21:32.50,way this time around at all. I've been playing the game since
312,00:21:35.67,00:21:35.67,"the second I got here. It's all a game, everything."
313,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,"Make no mistake about it, I am playing the game."
314,00:21:47.40,00:21:47.40,"When I saw you come out of that challenge, I was, like, so happy"
315,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,"when I seen you, man. I was so happy."
316,00:21:59.83,00:21:59.83,"Listen, this is the way it has to go down-- we need to get rid"
317,00:22:05.90,00:22:05.90,of Lex tomorrow. >> Why not Jenna or
318,00:22:10.47,00:22:10.47,Rupert first? I'm here because of him.
319,00:22:15.80,00:22:15.80,>> Don't go soft on me. I know it sucks.
320,00:22:18.00,00:22:18.00,"I promised him the same thing. He came up to me, first person"
321,00:22:20.50,00:22:20.50,he came up to. >> It's not even that.
322,00:22:22.40,00:22:22.40,"It's not that... I'm just... I don't know, I'm scared."
323,00:22:26.97,00:22:26.97,>> Don't be scared. >> What if they're
324,00:22:28.77,00:22:28.77,targeting us? You and I are stirring all this
325,00:22:32.80,00:22:32.80,up. Do you know what I mean?
326,00:22:35.87,00:22:35.87,There's too many plans floating around and too many people are
327,00:22:37.87,00:22:37.87,talking. They're going to realize that
328,00:22:40.07,00:22:40.07,it's all coming down to us very soon and then they are going to
329,00:22:42.37,00:22:42.37,get rid of us instead of getting rid of somebody else.
330,00:22:44.07,00:22:44.07,>> It's not coming down to us because as soon as Lex is
331,00:22:47.10,00:22:47.10,"gone, Big Tom doesn't have a leg to stand on."
332,00:22:52.60,00:22:52.60,"I mean, this is a game, Amber. We're playing for a million"
333,00:22:55.73,00:22:55.73,"bucks over here, you know? Like, let me tell you something,"
334,00:22:59.13,00:22:59.13,"Jenna and Rupert and Big Tom, they're all gonna try to stick"
335,00:23:01.53,00:23:01.53,"it in our backs, too, all right? >> We've got our work cut"
336,00:23:05.93,00:23:05.93,out for us because we have so many deals going along with so
337,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,many people. We have deals with Lex and
338,00:23:12.07,00:23:12.07,Kathy. We have deals with Rupert and
339,00:23:13.40,00:23:13.40,Jenna. We have a deal with Big Tom.
340,00:23:15.50,00:23:15.50,Who the hell knows what's going on with Alicia?
341,00:23:17.80,00:23:17.80,"It's insane. My mind is like, freaking out"
342,00:23:20.70,00:23:20.70,"right now. >> Yeah, I definitely"
343,00:23:22.87,00:23:22.87,missed you. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
344,00:23:39.57,00:23:39.57,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! All right."
345,00:23:45.93,00:23:45.93,Let's get to today's first individual immunity challenge.
346,00:23:50.53,00:23:50.53,Tribal immunity is no more. This is what you covet.
347,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,>> Wow. That's cool. >> PROBST: As long as you are
348,00:23:58.97,00:23:58.97,"wearing the immunity necklace, you are safe from the vote at"
349,00:24:01.30,00:24:01.30,"Tribal Council. When you don't have this on, you"
350,00:24:03.53,00:24:03.53,"are vulnerable, and now that we are in an individual game, it"
351,00:24:06.73,00:24:06.73,becomes all that much more important.
352,00:24:08.40,00:24:08.40,Today's immunity challenge will test your skills in the water.
353,00:24:11.30,00:24:11.30,First round is a traditional hold-your-breath competition.
354,00:24:14.80,00:24:14.80,You will be divided into groups of men and women: The two men
355,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,who stay down the longest will move on to the final round;
356,00:24:21.30,00:24:21.30,the two women who stay down the longest will move on to the
357,00:24:23.83,00:24:23.83,"final round. For the final round, you will"
358,00:24:25.90,00:24:25.90,"race along a ladder, which is tethered to the ocean floor."
359,00:24:29.63,00:24:29.63,"Along the way, you'll be releasing a series of buoys."
360,00:24:32.30,00:24:32.30,The first person to release all ten buoys wins immunity.
361,00:24:36.10,00:24:36.10,Here's the twist. We will run the final leg twice.
362,00:24:39.30,00:24:39.30,Two men will run the final leg. The winner receives immunity.
363,00:24:42.40,00:24:42.40,Two women will run the final leg.
364,00:24:44.23,00:24:44.23,"The winner receives immunity. >> Oh, my God."
365,00:24:46.07,00:24:46.07,">> PROBST: So at tonight's Tribal Council, two people..."
366,00:24:49.37,00:24:49.37,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: ...will be wearing"
367,00:24:52.37,00:24:52.37,the necklace. Two people will be safe from the
368,00:24:54.30,00:24:54.30,vote. >> That's big.
369,00:24:55.57,00:24:55.57,>> PROBST: I know at this point in the game-- huge stakes.
370,00:24:57.53,00:24:57.53,>> That's huge. >> Yeah.
371,00:24:58.83,00:24:58.83,>> PROBST: Swim out. Wait for my go.
372,00:25:00.80,00:25:00.80,"All right, guys. Here we go. The two women that stay down the"
373,00:25:03.40,00:25:03.40,longest and the two men to stay down the longest move on to the
374,00:25:06.23,00:25:06.23,"final round. Three, two, one, go down."
375,00:25:27.73,00:25:27.73,Alicia and Jenna are up. First three women are up.
