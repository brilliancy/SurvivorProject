268,00:14:46.73,00:14:46.73,AND YET HE HAD THOSE REWARDS.
269,00:14:49.10,00:14:49.10,SO IT JUST STILL WASN'T ENOUGH.

277,00:15:07.67,00:15:07.67,AND MY FIRST THOUGHT IS I HAVE TO BE THE FIRST PERSON
278,00:15:09.77,00:15:09.77,TO GET TO EDDIE. EDDIE IS SOMEBODY THAT I
279,00:15:12.80,00:15:12.80,HAVEN'T REALLY BONDED WITH THAT CLOSELY BUT I NEED TO
280,00:15:15.93,00:15:15.93,GET INTO HIS GOOD GRACES. SINCE HE'S PROBABLY THE GUY
281,00:15:19.07,00:15:19.07,MOST LIKELY TO WIN THE NEXT COMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND
282,00:15:21.40,00:15:21.40,THEREFORE TO BE IN A POSITION OF POWER TO

376,00:21:14.93,00:21:14.93,IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. COCHRAN DROPS HIS STACK
377,00:21:20.97,00:21:20.97,AGAIN. IT'S DAWN AND EDDIE TRYING
378,00:21:24.07,00:21:24.07,TO CATCH SHERRI. SHERRI HAS NOT WON AN
379,00:21:28.10,00:21:28.10,INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE YET. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT ONE TO
380,00:21:31.20,00:21:31.20,WIN. GIVING YOU AN ADVANCE IN THE
381,00:21:33.53,00:21:33.53,FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE. THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE
382,00:21:36.70,00:21:36.70,THAT SENDS YOU TO THE END. SHERRI LOSES HALF OF HER
383,00:21:43.53,00:21:43.53,STACK. OPENING THE DOOR FOR DAWN
384,00:21:45.93,00:21:45.93,NOW WHOSE'S NOW BACK IN THE LEAD.
385,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,AND DAWN LOSES HER STACK. EDDIE NOW IN THE LEAD WITH
386,00:21:53.07,00:21:53.07,COCHRAN TRYING TO CATCH EDDIE.

388,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,BEHIND HIM IS SHERRI. AND COMING UP IS COCHRAN.
389,00:22:04.40,00:22:04.40,EDDIE GETTING CLOSER. HE ONLY HAS FOUR CARDS LEFT.
390,00:22:07.80,00:22:07.80,WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO REACH THE TOP?
391,00:22:13.17,00:22:13.17,"EDDIE LOSES HALF HIS STACK, OPENING THE DOOR FOR SHERRI"
392,00:22:16.83,00:22:16.83,AGAIN. RIGHT NOW IT IS SHERRI AND

394,00:22:22.47,00:22:22.47,COCHRAN RIGHT BEHIND. EDDIE TRYING TO STAY IN IT.
395,00:22:25.70,00:22:25.70,DAWN'S STARTING OVER. SHERRI GETTING CLOSER.
396,00:22:28.97,00:22:28.97,CAN SHE KEEP IT STEADY? THIS IS THE CLOSEST SHE'S
397,00:22:33.37,00:22:33.37,BEEN. COCHRAN NOW RIGHT THERE.
398,00:22:35.43,00:22:35.43,"IT IS COCHRAN AND SHERRI, VERY CLOSE."
399,00:22:43.23,00:22:43.23,WE ARE DEAD EVEN. RIGHT NOW BOTH ARE AT THE
400,00:22:47.33,00:22:47.33,SAME SPOT. BOTH PLACING ANOTHER CARD.
401,00:22:51.13,00:22:51.13,SHERRI WITH ANOTHER CARD. COCHRAN WITH ANOTHER CARD.
402,00:23:01.47,00:23:01.47,"SHERRI HANGING ON, BARELY. SHERRI LOSES HER ENTIRE"
403,00:23:06.50,00:23:06.50,STACK. OPENING THE DOOR FOR
404,00:23:08.30,00:23:08.30,COCHRAN. ES HAS ONE CARD AWAY.
405,00:23:11.50,00:23:11.50,IT WOULD BE HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE WIN.

412,00:23:50.60,00:23:50.60,THIS COULD BE A MILLION DOLLAR REWARD RIGHT HERE.
413,00:23:53.77,00:23:53.77,KEEP IT SEALED UNTIL THE CHALLENGE.
414,00:23:56.13,00:23:56.13,"CONGRATS. GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK"

418,00:24:05.47,00:24:05.47,BUT I KEEP THINKING YOU'RE NOT GUARANTEED ANYTHING.
419,00:24:08.20,00:24:08.20,SO REALLY WHAT'S IT WILL COME DOWN TO IS WHO WINS
420,00:24:12.03,00:24:12.03,IMMUNITY. IF YOU DON'T WIN IMMUNITY
421,00:24:13.70,00:24:13.70,"YOURSELF, YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK."
422,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,">> YEAH TO GO, COCHRAN. >> YOU EARNED THAT."
423,00:24:51.30,00:24:51.30,>> MY GREAT CHALLENGE STREAK WHICH WAS TEMPORARILY ON
424,00:24:55.07,00:24:55.07,HOLD HAS COME ROARING BACK. I STACKED A HOUSE OF CARDS
425,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,BETTER THAN ANY OF MY OPPONENTS AND WON NOT ONLY
426,00:25:03.00,00:25:03.00,"THE THRILL OF BEING ANOTHER VICTOR IN ANOTHER CHALLENGE,"
427,00:25:06.90,00:25:06.90,BUT AN ADVANTAGE IN THE UPCOMING FINAL IMMUNITY

432,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,DOLLAR ADVANTAGE. SO WING THE ADVANTAGE WAS
433,00:25:20.67,00:25:20.67,HUGE. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT
434,00:25:22.37,00:25:22.37,POTENTIALLY COULD HELP ME BUT BECAUSE I KEPT IT OUT OF
435,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,THE HANDS OF SOME PEOPLE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAVE IT.
436,00:25:27.77,00:25:27.77,I WAS SCARED THAT EDDIE MIGHT GET THE ADVANTAGE.
437,00:25:31.40,00:25:31.40,I WOULDN'T WANT DAWN TO HAVE IT IN CASE I DECIDED I
438,00:25:35.33,00:25:35.33,WANTED HER TO HAVE IT INSTEAD IS SO IT IS IN THE
439,00:25:37.60,00:25:37.60,"RIGHT HANDS, AND CAPABLE HANDS."
440,00:25:39.83,00:25:39.83,AND I'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >> I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
441,00:25:46.27,00:25:46.27,STANDING BESIDE YOU THAN DAWN.
442,00:25:48.37,00:25:48.37,">> NO, WE HAVE TO. >> I KNOW."
443,00:25:50.20,00:25:50.20,>> IF IT'S THE FINAL THREE I WOULD WANT TO SIT NEXT TO
444,00:25:52.77,00:25:52.77,COCHRAN AND EDDIE-- EDDIE. DAWN HAS PLAYED THE SYMPATHY
445,00:25:56.87,00:25:56.87,CARD IN THIS GAME LIKE NO OTHER.
446,00:25:59.53,00:25:59.53,THE WHOLE MOTHER AND SIX CHILDREN AND ADOPTION AND
447,00:26:02.40,00:26:02.40,CRYING. AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT
448,00:26:04.13,00:26:04.13,"WOULD HELP DAWN WIN THE GAME. >> DAWN IS GOING TO WIN, I"
449,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23,THINK SHE IS NUMBER ONE TO WIN ALL THE JURY VOTES.
450,00:26:13.37,00:26:13.37,>> UH-HUH. >> HELLO.
451,00:26:14.70,00:26:14.70,YEAH. I'M NOT SITTING NEXT TO
452,00:26:16.70,00:26:16.70,THAT. SHE'S TOO POWERFUL.
453,00:26:19.40,00:26:19.40,"HUH-UH. >> NOTHING NEW, HUH?"
454,00:26:29.67,00:26:29.67,>> I'M LOCKED. >> I AM 100% LOCKED TO
455,00:26:32.70,00:26:32.70,"YOUMENT I WON'T LIE THOUGH, I'M NERVOUS ABOUT HOW IT IS"
456,00:26:36.07,00:26:36.07,GOING TO END. >> I MEAN SHERRI IS IN.
457,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,>> HOW COME SHE-- EVERYBODY KNOWS --
458,00:26:41.23,00:26:41.23,>> MAYBE SHE'S TRYING TO -- >> I THINK FOR TODAY I JUST
459,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE THERE IS SO MUCH BREAKING
460,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,AWAY TO ADD AND SIGHT-- ANXIETY.
461,00:26:57.63,00:26:57.63,>> EVERY DAY I GET TO SEE A NEW FREAKOUT FROM DAWN.

463,00:27:03.43,00:27:03.43,"ARMS, ACTUALLY BEING LEFT ALONE."
464,00:27:06.20,00:27:06.20,FORTUNATELY TODAY DAWN WAS LEANING MORE TOWARDS THE
465,00:27:09.43,00:27:09.43,CATATONIC BREAKDOWN. AND A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO
466,00:27:11.37,00:27:11.37,WITH THE SUDDEN INFLUX OF PARANOIA THAT SHE'S HAVING
467,00:27:14.20,00:27:14.20,THAT WHAT IF EDDIE AND SHERRI TAKE HER OUT.
468,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03,>> IF YOU ARE'S WORRIED THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU

473,00:27:34.43,00:27:34.43,THERE'S SOME MOMENT WHERE I AM EXHAUSTED AND I'M
474,00:27:38.53,00:27:38.53,LIKE-- I'M LIKE A BABY STOMPING MY FEET.
475,00:27:44.30,00:27:44.30,">> IT'S THE SAME WAY FOR YOU, RIGHT."
476,00:27:46.07,00:27:46.07,">> THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SCENARIO, NONE."
477,00:27:48.10,00:27:48.10,I MEAN YOU FEEL LIKE THAT PLEASE DON'T START

479,00:27:53.57,00:27:53.57,"ALWAYS SAY WE'RE A LOCK, WE'RE A LOCK."
480,00:27:56.33,00:27:56.33,">> ABSOLUTELY, TO THE VERY END."
481,00:27:57.33,00:27:57.33,"I WAS ACTUALLY WHEN WE WERE COMING OVER HERE, I WAS LIKE"
482,00:28:00.13,00:28:00.13,I WISH COCHRAN WOULD JUST SPEND 20 MINUTES AND
483,00:28:02.87,00:28:02.87,REASSURE ME BECAUSE I FEEL --
484,00:28:04.13,00:28:04.13,>> THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING NOW.
485,00:28:05.90,00:28:05.90,">> BECAUSE I FEEL VULNERABLE, YOU KNOW."
486,00:28:07.97,00:28:07.97,>> DAWN FEELS LIKE SHE AUTOMATICALLY DESERVES A
487,00:28:10.70,00:28:10.70,"FAST PASS TO THE FINALS. WHY, EXACTLY?"
488,00:28:12.73,00:28:12.73,I DON'T KNOW. EVERY DAY IS A ROLLER
489,00:28:14.83,00:28:14.83,COASTER WITH HER. AND IT'S NOT FUN.
490,00:28:16.57,00:28:16.57,IT'S NOT FUNNY. ON DAY 37 SHE SHOULD BE
491,00:28:19.13,00:28:19.13,PARANOID BECAUSE I AM CONSIDERING DITCHING HER.
492,00:28:38.07,00:28:38.07,>> ALL RIGHT. >> OH MY GOD.
493,00:28:42.47,00:28:42.47,>> ONE LAST CHANCE TO CONTROL YOUR DESTINY.

496,00:28:57.07,00:28:57.07,>> YOU'LL WAIT FOR SOME MEN IN A BOAT.
497,00:28:59.07,00:28:59.07,"LOVE IT. WAY TO GO, GUYS."
498,00:29:03.73,00:29:03.73,>> WE RECEIVED TREE MAIL TODAY LETTING US KNOW TODAY
499,00:29:06.23,00:29:06.23,IS THE DAY OF OUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
500,00:29:08.50,00:29:08.50,BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT IS THE FAMOUS SURVIVORRIGHTS
501,00:29:10.90,00:29:10.90,OF PASSAGE. SOMETHINGIVE'S BEEN LOOKING
502,00:29:12.70,00:29:12.70,"FORWARD TO, HOPING I WOULD GET TO SEE THIS MOMENT IN"
503,00:29:14.70,00:29:14.70,THE GAME. IT'S KIND OF A NOSTALGIC
504,00:29:16.70,00:29:16.70,MOMENT WHERE YOU GET TO REFLECT ON THE PAST 38 DAYS
505,00:29:19.13,00:29:19.13,AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY AHEAD OF US.
506,00:29:33.63,00:29:33.63,>> SHE KIND OF MADE SURVIVOR HISTORY FOR MAYBE NOT THE
507,00:29:36.67,00:29:36.67,BEST REASONS BUT SHE WASN'T VOTED OFF FIRST THIS TIME
508,00:29:39.73,00:29:39.73,"BECAUSE SHE WAS A BAD PLAYER, SHE WAS VOTED OFF BECAUSE"
509,00:29:43.23,00:29:43.23,"SHE WAS A HUGE THREAT. >> YEAH, THAT WAS NOT A"
510,00:29:45.10,00:29:45.10,WOMAN I WANTED TO GO AGAINST.
511,00:29:46.50,00:29:46.50,>> MY SURVIVOR EXPERIENCE THE SECOND TIME AROUND WAS
512,00:29:48.87,00:29:48.87,DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTING. I FEEL A LITTLE HONORED THAT
513,00:29:51.77,00:29:51.77,MY FELLOW TRIBE MATES THOUGHT THAT I WAS SUCH A
514,00:29:53.83,00:29:53.83,THREAT THAT THEY HAD TO TAKE ME OUT FIRST TO WICHBLT I
515,00:29:56.93,00:29:56.93,WAS THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL OF THEM AT THIS GAME.
516,00:29:59.63,00:29:59.63,I DEFINITELY SAW THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE IT
517,00:30:01.90,00:30:01.90,IS PRETTY FUNNY. I GUESS SI HAVE A LOT OF
518,00:30:04.77,00:30:04.77,"POTENTIAL AT SURVIVOR, WHICH IS GOING TO REMAIN"

523,00:30:26.87,00:30:26.87,AND YOU REALLY LEARN QUICKLY THAT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE
524,00:30:29.30,00:30:29.30,MONEY. I WOULD SAY MY BEST MOMENT
525,00:30:30.93,00:30:30.93,"WOULD JUST BE MEETING HOPE, EDDIE AND REYNOLDS."
526,00:30:33.63,00:30:33.63,I WOULD SAY IT PROBABLY COST ME THE GAME BEING FRIENDS
527,00:30:36.10,00:30:36.10,WITH THEM BUT I FEEL LIKE I WILL BE FRIENDS WITH THEM
528,00:30:38.53,00:30:38.53,FOR LIFE. >> HOPE.

537,00:31:21.00,00:31:21.00,TAKES A LOT TO BRING ME DOWN.
538,00:31:22.63,00:31:22.63,BEING MEDICALLY PULLED FROM THE GAME T WAS LIKE MAN THIS
539,00:31:25.43,00:31:25.43,IS HARD-CORE. I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT THAT
540,00:31:28.10,00:31:28.10,MUCH PAIN. >> LAURA.

544,00:31:44.47,00:31:44.47,LOVE. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT I
545,00:31:46.47,00:31:46.47,CAME OUT OF THIS GAME APPRECIATING THOSE PEOPLE A
546,00:31:48.57,00:31:48.57,LOT MORE. >> BRANDON.
547,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,">> OH, BRANDON IS A CHALLENGE BEAST."
548,00:31:58.77,00:31:58.77,I THINK THERE WAS A POINT IN ITS GAME WHERE HIS PERSONAL
549,00:32:01.20,00:32:01.20,LIFE GOT TOO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WITH THE GAME.
550,00:32:05.27,00:32:05.27,>> I WAS GIVING IT EVERYTHING I GOT.
551,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,I PLAYED FOR A MILLION DOLLARS OUT THERE AND WHEN I

553,00:32:13.17,00:32:13.17,FOLKS. I MADE IT RAIN WITH THEM.
554,00:32:16.23,00:32:16.23,I DON'T REGRET NONE OF IT BECAUSE I PROVED MY POINT.
555,00:32:19.63,00:32:19.63,I MADE MY STATEMENT. I WAS THE AUTHOR OF MY
556,00:32:26.00,00:32:26.00,"ELIMINATION. >> MATT, MATT, MATT."
557,00:32:33.20,00:32:33.20,>> SURVIVOR IS ONE OF THE HARDEST GAMES THAT YOU COULD

559,00:32:38.70,00:32:38.70,HARDEST THINGS THAT I'VE EVER DONE.
560,00:32:40.73,00:32:40.73,I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A WAY STRONGER MAN BECAUSE OF THIS
561,00:32:45.03,00:32:45.03,EXPERIENCE. >> JULIA.

799,00:47:10.37,00:47:10.37,I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
800,00:47:12.43,00:47:12.43,CONGRATS. >> THANK YOU.
801,00:47:15.87,00:47:15.87,>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. >> IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE ANY
802,00:47:18.93,00:47:18.93,BETTER. AND I'M ACTUALLY IN A
803,00:47:20.70,00:47:20.70,POSITION OF POWER. I MEAN SHERRI WANTS TO WORK
804,00:47:22.40,00:47:22.40,"WITH ME, EDDIE WANTS TO WORK WITH ME, AND DAWN WANTS TO"
805,00:47:24.77,00:47:24.77,WORK WITH ME. AND I HAVE MY PICK OF THE
806,00:47:26.43,00:47:26.43,LITTER. SO THERE IS A DILL BE MY
807,00:47:29.97,00:47:29.97,"SHOULDER SAYING MAN, I THINK I'M GOING TO GET RID OF"
808,00:47:33.50,00:47:33.50,DAWN. >> COCHRAN THAT WAS
809,00:47:57.23,00:47:57.23,INCREDIBLE. THAT PUZZLE WAS HARD.
810,00:47:59.80,00:47:59.80,>> YEAH. I DIDN'T-- I'M STILL A
811,00:48:02.23,00:48:02.23,"LITTLE BIT IN DISBELIEF. >> I, COCHRAN, HAVE WON FOUR"
812,00:48:06.17,00:48:06.17,INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES. SO RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING
813,00:48:08.30,00:48:08.30,"OKAY, I GOT THE MILLION. THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS WHO"
814,00:48:11.77,00:48:11.77,"DESERVES $1 LUNN,000 IN SECOND PLACE."
815,00:48:13.67,00:48:13.67,>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >>.
816,00:48:14.70,00:48:14.70,>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FULLY SET IN YET.
817,00:48:17.07,00:48:17.07,"I MEAN THIS IS 13 YEARS. >> I KNOW, BELIEVE ME, I"
818,00:48:21.10,00:48:21.10,KNOW. >> IT'S TO THE GOING TO BE
819,00:48:22.43,00:48:22.43,SHERRI. SHERRI MIGHT BE ABLE TO
820,00:48:24.27,00:48:24.27,SQUEAK OUT ONE VOTE BUT SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET
821,00:48:26.23,00:48:26.23,ENOUGH TO GET SECOND PLACE. SO NOW IT IS ABOUT TO I WANT
822,00:48:29.03,00:48:29.03,TO BRING DAWN AND CONSTANT EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS OR EDDIE
823,00:48:32.60,00:48:32.60,A CHAUVINISTIC 23-YEAR-OLD IDIOT.
824,00:48:35.50,00:48:35.50,>> IT WAS JUST LIKE AN EPIC SURVIVOR DAY.
825,00:48:39.63,00:48:39.63,>> THE BALANCE FOR SECOND PLACE IS HEATED.
826,00:48:42.27,00:48:42.27,I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
827,00:48:44.00,00:48:44.00,IT'S SO LONELY AT THE TOP. IT'S HORRIBLE FOR ME TO SAY.
828,00:48:55.20,00:48:55.20,">> CRAZY, COCHRAN. >> THAT WAS SO-- I MEAN IT"
829,00:49:00.70,00:49:00.70,REALLY IS EMOTIONAL. >> IT'S JUST SO MUCH.
830,00:49:06.47,00:49:06.47,I MEAN SO MUCH COMPARED TO LAST SEASON.
831,00:49:08.50,00:49:08.50,IT'S SO DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE COMPLETELY
832,00:49:10.63,00:49:10.63,"DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW. >> I MEAN WHAT DO WE"
833,00:49:16.73,00:49:16.73,DO-- WHAT IS YOUR PLAN YOUR LAST NIGHT.
834,00:49:20.17,00:49:20.17,>> I DO FULLY TRUST COCHRAN. AND I FEEL LIKE I'M MY OWN
835,00:49:23.50,00:49:23.50,WORST ENEMY. THAT I'M LIKE BEATING MYSELF
836,00:49:25.57,00:49:25.57,UP IF I DON'T MAKE THE NEXT STEP.
837,00:49:27.47,00:49:27.47,THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I DESERVE
838,00:49:30.73,00:49:30.73,"TO DO GOOD. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN."
839,00:49:41.37,00:49:41.37,>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE YOU OR DAWN FOR TONIGHT.
840,00:49:44.70,00:49:44.70,>> ONLY ONE OF US CAN GO. >> I KNOW.
841,00:49:46.33,00:49:46.33,>> I THINK IT WILL DEFINITELY BE ME MORE THAN
842,00:49:48.73,00:49:48.73,DAWN. DAWN IS GOING PLAY THE
843,00:49:50.83,00:49:50.83,"MOTHER CARD, AND START CRYING AND PEOPLE WILL --"
844,00:49:54.53,00:49:54.53,>> DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL BUY THE MOTHER CARD.
845,00:49:57.77,00:49:57.77,>> ABSOLUTELY. >> I KNEW IT WOULD BE ME OR
846,00:49:59.03,00:49:59.03,DAWN TODAY. >> I REALLY DO THINK I HAVE
847,00:50:00.70,00:50:00.70,THE BEST CHANCE TO WIN THIS TO GET IN THE FINAL THREE SO
848,00:50:03.10,00:50:03.10,"I AM TRYING TO CONVINCE COCHRAN ON A LOGICAL LEVEL,"
849,00:50:06.43,00:50:06.43,NOT EMOTIONAL OR BULLYING SENSE INTO BRING ME INTO THE
850,00:50:08.90,00:50:08.90,FINAL THREE. >> THE JURY LOVES EVERYTHING
851,00:50:10.97,00:50:10.97,YOU SAY. >> IT'S BECAUSE I'M AN
852,00:50:14.67,00:50:14.67,IDIOT. WHAT I DO TALK ABOUT.
853,00:50:16.03,00:50:16.03,I DON'T TALK ABOUT STRATEGY. I HAVEN'T PISSED ANYBODY OFF
854,00:50:20.10,00:50:20.10,BUT ON THE OPPOSITE IS I ONLY VOTED ONE PERSON OFF SO
855,00:50:24.00,00:50:24.00,HOW STRATEGIC HAVE I BEEN. >> I'M TRYING TO REASON WITH
856,00:50:27.20,00:50:27.20,COCHRAN TO GET HIM TO TAKE ME FISMT DO WIN THE MILLION
857,00:50:29.37,00:50:29.37,DOLLAR PRIZE I WANT TO OPEN LIKE A DOG KIND OF LIKE
858,00:50:32.03,00:50:32.03,"SHELTER, KENNEL, PLAY PEN AREA, LIKE ATTACHED TO A"
859,00:50:35.47,00:50:35.47,BAR. SO LIKE THOSE ARE MY TWO
860,00:50:38.20,00:50:38.20,FAVORITE THINGS. I LIKE DOGS AND I LIKE BARS
861,00:50:40.90,00:50:40.90,P IF I COULD OPEN A BAR AND YOU BRING YOUR DOG THERE IT
862,00:50:43.23,00:50:43.23,WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE. >> I-- PLAYED SUCH A GOOD
863,00:50:48.73,00:50:48.73,GAME. >> IT IS A TOUGH DECISION.
864,00:50:50.37,00:50:50.37,>> THAT'S THE END OF THE GAME FOR YOU.
865,00:51:00.17,00:51:00.17,I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS LESS OF A THREAT IN TERMS OF
866,00:51:03.60,00:51:03.60,ME BRINGING THE MILLION DOLLARS AND TITLE.
867,00:51:05.27,00:51:05.27,"I KNOW SCHERR LI GO TO THE END, AND I CAN BEAT HER."
868,00:51:08.77,00:51:08.77,THE BIGGEST QUESTION MARK IS REQUEST I BEAT EDDIE OR CAN
869,00:51:12.07,00:51:12.07,I BEAT DAWN. THEY'RE BOTH PEOPLE THAT
870,00:51:14.63,00:51:14.63,BRING A LOT OF PROS AND CONS TO THE TABLE.
871,00:51:18.30,00:51:18.30,>> I HOPE I DON'T TALK MYSELF OUT OF THE DECISION.
872,00:51:37.57,00:51:37.57,>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
873,00:51:42.23,00:51:42.23,"MIKE, PHILLIP, MALCOLM, REYNOLD, ANDREA, BRENDA AND"
874,00:51:50.77,00:51:50.77,ERIK WHO WAS PULLED FROM THE GAME FOR MEDICAL REASONS BUT
875,00:51:54.90,00:51:54.90,RETURNS AS A MEMBER OF THE JURY.
876,00:51:59.70,00:51:59.70,SO A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
877,00:52:03.80,00:52:03.80,"MOMENTS AFTER TRIBAL ENDED COCHRAN, WHAT HAPPENED?"
878,00:52:07.40,00:52:07.40,>> LIT REALLYLY WITHIN MINUTES AFTER LEAVING TRIBAL
879,00:52:10.17,00:52:10.17,COUNCIL ERIK STARTED WALKING UNSTEADILY AND THE NEXT
880,00:52:12.50,00:52:12.50,THING I KNEW HE WAS KIND OF PASSED OUT ON THIS ROCK.
881,00:52:14.90,00:52:14.90,AND IT WAS A SCARY REMINDER OF EVEN HOW LATE IN THE GAME
882,00:52:17.97,00:52:17.97,SOMETHING DEVASTATING CAN HAPPEN.
883,00:52:19.27,00:52:19.27,I THINK WE WERE ALL IN SHOCK.
884,00:52:21.37,00:52:21.37,">> Jeff: EDDIE, DID IT OPEN A DOOR FOR YOU IN A WAY"
885,00:52:23.57,00:52:23.57,BECAUSE ERIK IS A COMPETITOR AND HE'S GONE AND LOOKING AT
886,00:52:27.83,00:52:27.83,"THESE THREE, MAYBE I GOT A SHOT."
887,00:52:29.83,00:52:29.83,>> IT DEFINITELY STARTED THINGS UP A BITMENT BECAUSE
888,00:52:31.47,00:52:31.47,"I THINK WAS ERIK, DAWN AND SHERRI WHO WERE THE PLANNED"
889,00:52:34.37,00:52:34.37,FINAL THREE. SO I DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT
890,00:52:39.13,00:52:39.13,"OF ROOM TO CAUSE COMENTION. >> Jeff: COCHRAN, I DIDN'T"
891,00:52:43.17,00:52:43.17,HEAR YOUR NAME IN THAT FINAL THREE.
892,00:52:44.77,00:52:44.77,">> YEAH, IT IS ALARMING. IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING"
893,00:52:47.30,00:52:47.30,THAT ERIK WASN'T THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMEBODY
894,00:52:49.67,00:52:49.67,KEEPING ME OUT OF THE POTENTIAL FINAL THREE.
895,00:52:50.97,00:52:50.97,IT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE WENT THAT MADE IT
896,00:52:54.43,00:52:54.43,HARD TO CELEBRATE. >> Jeff: TALK ABOUT THE TWO
897,00:52:56.43,00:52:56.43,CHALLENGES THAT HAPPENED. FIRST THE REWARD IS AN
898,00:52:58.40,00:52:58.40,ADVANTAGE IN THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
899,00:53:00.83,00:53:00.83,COCHRAN WINS. HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL
900,00:53:03.67,00:53:03.67,CHALLENGE. HE CAN'T EVEN RESIST.
901,00:53:05.83,00:53:05.83,"YOU JUST FEEL SO GOOD, RIGHT."
902,00:53:07.43,00:53:07.43,>> IT'S BIZARRE TO ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT
903,00:53:10.07,00:53:10.07,"THE SURVIVOR, OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST."
904,00:53:13.20,00:53:13.20,I SAID MAYBE I CAN SATISFY A THIRD OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS.
905,00:53:16.33,00:53:16.33,"OUTWIT, MAYBE. I FEEL LIKE LAST TIME PEOPLE"
906,00:53:18.63,00:53:18.63,THOUGHT I WAS WORTHLESS AND I STARTED TO BELIEVE I WAS
907,00:53:20.73,00:53:20.73,WORTHLESS. NOW I'M FEEL MORNING
908,00:53:22.53,00:53:22.53,CONFIDENT. THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE TO
909,00:53:24.20,00:53:24.20,SUCCEED IN THAT WAS REMARKABLE TO ME.
910,00:53:26.07,00:53:26.07,>> Jeff: SO THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
911,00:53:28.63,00:53:28.63,"CHALLENGE. COCHRAN, WHAT IS THE FEELING"
912,00:53:30.70,00:53:30.70,WHEN I YELL COCHRAN WINS IMMUNITY.
913,00:53:34.47,00:53:34.47,>> IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOMENT OF THIS
914,00:53:36.17,00:53:36.17,GAME FOR ME SO FAR. IT WASN'T THE FACT
915,00:53:38.53,00:53:38.53,NECESSARILY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE SAFE FOR TONIGHT'S
916,00:53:40.83,00:53:40.83,TRIBAL COUNCIL. IT WAS THE FACT THAT I
917,00:53:42.50,00:53:42.50,WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CAME-- CAPABLE OF DOING THAT
918,00:53:45.07,00:53:45.07,"A COUPLE YEAR AGO. >> Jeff: SO DAWN, ONE OF YOU"
919,00:53:48.47,00:53:48.47,WILL BECOME THE 8th AND FINAL MEMBER OF THE JURY.
920,00:53:52.73,00:53:52.73,COCHRAN CLEARLY HAS NOTHING WORRY ABOUT AND HAS A LITTLE
921,00:53:55.23,00:53:55.23,BIT OF SWAY BECAUSE HE'S SAFE.
922,00:53:57.07,00:53:57.07,WHAT CASE DO YOU MAKE TO HIM TODAY.
923,00:53:59.03,00:53:59.03,BECAUSE THERE IS A MILLION DOLLAR DECISION.
924,00:54:00.60,00:54:00.60,">> WELL, I THINK I HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF"
925,00:54:04.87,00:54:04.87,MALIGNING MYSELF WITH MOST PEOPLE ON THE JURY AND EDDIE
926,00:54:07.63,00:54:07.63,HANDS DOWN IS SO LIKABLE. HE HASN'T HAD TO SEND ANYONE
927,00:54:10.63,00:54:10.63,HOME ON THE JURY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PHILLIP.
928,00:54:13.33,00:54:13.33,THEY'RE GOING LOVE HIM. >> Jeff: EDDIE.
929,00:54:19.13,00:54:19.13,">> YEAH-- IT'S YOUR GAME, BROTHER."
930,00:54:23.37,00:54:23.37,>> IF I WERE DAWN I BREW PROBABLY BE SAYING THE SAME
931,00:54:26.03,00:54:26.03,THING. ON THE FLIP SIDE NOT TO PUT
932,00:54:28.67,00:54:28.67,MY OWN SELF DOWN BUT I REALLY DIDN'T ONLY VOTE OFF
933,00:54:31.47,00:54:31.47,ONE PERSON ON THE JURY. SO STRATEGY WISE HOW MUCH I

937,00:54:41.67,00:54:41.67,MADE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE WAY IT'S PLAYED.

1040,01:01:16.47,01:01:16.47,AND I'M PROUD OF THAT. BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE MADE

1071,01:02:34.57,01:02:34.57,THIS IS MY GAME TO LOSE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE DOUBTS
1072,01:02:37.10,01:02:37.10,ARE PLAGUING MY MIND. I'M JUST KIND OF THIS

1078,01:02:54.43,01:02:54.43,PLAYED. BUT WHEN I'M NOT FEELING

1098,01:04:46.00,01:04:46.00,TO SAY THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE GROUP OF YOU.
1099,01:04:48.60,01:04:48.60,AND FEELING A LITTLE BIT HUMBLED BECAUSE I KNOW HOW
1100,01:04:51.03,01:04:51.03,HARD EVERYONE PLAYED. I THINK YOU GUYS ALL SAW HOW
1101,01:04:53.70,01:04:53.70,HARD THIS GAME WAS FOR ME. I THINK A LOT OF THE EMOTION
1102,01:04:56.53,01:04:56.53,HAD TO DO WITH HOW HARD IT WAS FOR ME TO BE DUPLICITOUS
1103,01:05:00.57,01:05:00.57,BECAUSE WHEN I CAME OUT HERE I MADE A COUPLE OF PROMISES
1104,01:05:03.07,01:05:03.07,TO MYSELF ABOUT HOW I WOULD PLAY.
1105,01:05:05.03,01:05:05.03,FIRST I WANTED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE ALLY WHO I WOULD
1106,01:05:07.43,01:05:07.43,BE WILLING TO TAKE TO THE END WHO I COULD STRATEGIZE
1107,01:05:09.97,01:05:09.97,WITH AND MAKE DECISIONS WITH.
1108,01:05:11.73,01:05:11.73,AND THAT WAS COCHRAN. THE SECOND THING IS I WANTED
1109,01:05:14.70,01:05:14.70,TO BE IN CONTROL OF MY OWN GAME.
1110,01:05:16.67,01:05:16.67,I WANTED TO BE PART OF GROUPS WHERE WHEN WE MADE
1111,01:05:19.67,01:05:19.67,DECISIONS IT INFLUENCED MY GAME.
1112,01:05:21.97,01:05:21.97,"AND THE THIRD THING IS ITS HARDEST PART, I HAD TO GIVE"
1113,01:05:25.53,01:05:25.53,MYSELF PERMISSION TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME AND
1114,01:05:29.00,01:05:29.00,BE WILLING TO USE THE THINGS THAT IN MY NORMAL LIFE WHEN
1115,01:05:32.23,01:05:32.23,"I BUILD TRUST AND FRIENDSHIPS WITH PEOPLE, I"
1116,01:05:34.67,01:05:34.67,DON'T EXPLOIT THEM. AND SO I HAD TO COME OUT
1117,01:05:38.63,01:05:38.63,RE-- REMINDING MYSELF THIS IS A GAME FOR A MILLION
1118,01:05:40.37,01:05:40.37,DOLLARS. PANNED IF THIS IS FOOTBALL I
1119,01:05:41.73,01:05:41.73,HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TACKLE.
1120,01:05:43.03,01:05:43.03,I FEEL PROUD OF THE GAME I PLAYED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I
1121,01:05:45.80,01:05:45.80,MADE THE HARD DECISIONS WHEN I HAD TO.
1122,01:05:47.50,01:05:47.50,AND THAT GOT US BOTH TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
1123,01:05:53.60,01:05:53.60,">> Jeff: SHERRI, YOU'RE UP. >> SO YOU ALL KNOW ME AS THE"
1124,01:05:56.83,01:05:56.83,STAY AT HOME MOM. AND I HAVE THREE CHILDREN.
1125,01:05:59.73,01:05:59.73,AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 18 YEARS AND ALL THIS IS
1126,01:06:02.13,01:06:02.13,TRUE. BUT I'M ALSO A VERY
1127,01:06:03.80,01:06:03.80,SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN. I HAVE 75 EMPLOYEES.
1128,01:06:06.93,01:06:06.93,AND I RUN SEVERAL BUSINESSES.
1129,01:06:09.90,01:06:09.90,AND WHEN I CAME INTO SURVIVOR I WAS GOING TO PLAY
1130,01:06:12.40,01:06:12.40,THE WAY I RUN MY BUSINESSES. I WAS GOING TO LOOK AT ALL
1131,01:06:16.50,01:06:16.50,OF YOU LIKE PEOPLE I DEAL WITH ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

1133,01:06:29.03,01:06:29.03,BY AM JUST SO NERVOUS. SO I HAD TO MAKE LIKE LOTS

1135,01:06:37.47,01:06:37.47,DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE TRIBE.
1136,01:06:38.90,01:06:38.90,BECAUSE HERE I'M A FAN. AND YOU GUYS ARE FAVORITES.
1137,01:06:42.73,01:06:42.73,AND I HAD TO GET IN AND INTEGRATE WITH EACH ONE OF

1299,01:14:09.60,01:14:09.60,STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER. I NEVER FELT THERE WAS ANY
1300,01:14:12.00,01:14:12.00,MALICE TOWARD ANYBODY. AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED
1301,01:14:14.43,01:14:14.43,PLAYING THE GAME WITH YOU. YOU ARE A REAL CLASS ACT.
1302,01:14:17.40,01:14:17.40,">> THANKS. >> Jeff: THANKS, PHILLIP."
1303,01:14:23.20,01:14:23.20,"ERIK. >> HEY, GUYS."
1304,01:14:24.87,01:14:24.87,"CON GRADLATIONS, FINAL THREE."
1305,01:14:27.30,01:14:27.30,I WANT TO TALK TO DAWN FIRST.
1306,01:14:30.03,01:14:30.03,>> OKAY. >> WE HELPED EACH OTHER
1307,01:14:31.73,01:14:31.73,THROUGH THIS AND I THOUGHT WE SHARED SOMETHING THAT WAS
1308,01:14:34.27,01:14:34.27,SO POWERFUL. AND AFTER I SAW THE VOTE
1309,01:14:36.87,01:14:36.87,"WITH BRIDGEA-- BRENDA WHAT WE HAD, YOU CRUSHED IT."
1310,01:14:41.30,01:14:41.30,IT WASN'T GENUINE T WASN'T SPECIAL.
1311,01:14:43.33,01:14:43.33,ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DAMAGE YOU CAUSED WHEN YOU PLAYED
1312,01:14:46.37,01:14:46.37,THE GAME YOU PLAYED? >> I CAME INTO THE GAME THIS
1313,01:14:48.80,01:14:48.80,TIME SAYING I WOULD USE THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I MADE TO
1314,01:14:52.03,01:14:52.03,ADVANCE MYSELF IN THE GAME. AND I DID THAT BY BEING MORE
1315,01:14:56.67,01:14:56.67,LOYAL TO COCHRAN AND THAT ALLIANCE AND MORE LOYAL TO
1316,01:15:00.90,01:15:00.90,WHO IS THE STRATEGIC THREAT FOR ME AND WHO NEEDS TO GO.
1317,01:15:03.73,01:15:03.73,THOSE WERE ALL HONEST CONNECTIONS.
1318,01:15:05.87,01:15:05.87,IT'S JUST I WAS PLAYING THE GAME TO GET FURTHER.
1319,01:15:09.67,01:15:09.67,">> SHERRI, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU."
1320,01:15:11.17,01:15:11.17,"IN THE SAME VEIN OF AWARENESS, YOU UNDERSTAND"
1321,01:15:13.73,01:15:13.73,WHY YOU ARE HERE RIGHT NOW? >> I'M HERE BECAUSE I PLAYED
1322,01:15:17.20,01:15:17.20,THE GAME HARD. >> WHAT DID YOU --
1323,01:15:19.80,01:15:19.80,>> AS HARD AS I CAN PLY IT BUT NOT THE WAY THAT YOU
1324,01:15:23.30,01:15:23.30,GUYS THOUGHT I SHOULD PLAY IT I PLAYED MY GAME.
1325,01:15:26.00,01:15:26.00,>> WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT DIGGING INTO YOUR STRATEGY?
1326,01:15:28.43,01:15:28.43,"NOBODY IS CANNING YOU THOSE QUESTIONS, ARE THEY?"
1327,01:15:30.50,01:15:30.50,>> I'M NOT SURE. >> YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY.
1328,01:15:32.80,01:15:32.80,">> NO. >> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TOP"
1329,01:15:34.53,01:15:34.53,ENLIGHTEN YOU A LITTLE BIT. YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING IN
1330,01:15:37.30,01:15:37.30,THIS GAME. YOU WERE A SEASHELL ON THE
1331,01:15:39.67,01:15:39.67,BEACH THE ENTIRE GAME. AND THAT'S WHY NO ONE --
1332,01:15:42.07,01:15:42.07,">> NASS'S YOUR OPINION, ERIK, AND THAT'S FINE."
1333,01:15:44.50,01:15:44.50,AND I DON'T CARE. THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
1334,01:15:46.17,01:15:46.17,>> I JUST WANT TO YOU -- >> BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
1335,01:15:48.97,01:15:48.97,HOW YOU CAN SIT HERE AND TALK DOWN TO ME BUT YOU CAN
1336,01:15:51.30,01:15:51.30,HAVE A HOLIER THAN THOU ATTITUDE LIKE ARE YOU
1337,01:15:54.37,01:15:54.37,HAVING. >> FIRST OF ALL I'M TO
1338,01:15:55.77,01:15:55.77,THE -- >> YOU'RE HAVING THAT
1339,01:15:57.70,01:15:57.70,"ATTITUDE F ARE YOU DONE WITH ME, I AM DONE WITH YOUMENT I"
1340,01:15:59.97,01:15:59.97,"DON'T NEED TO LISTEN TO YOU, OBVIOUSLY I AM NOT GOING TO"
1341,01:16:03.97,01:16:03.97,GET T I -- >> I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP
1342,01:16:06.50,01:16:06.50,YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU SIT.
1343,01:16:07.70,01:16:07.70,>> I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. >> ALL RIGHT.
1344,01:16:09.13,01:16:09.13,">> NOW YOU CAN SIT DOWN. >> THANKS, ERIC."
1345,01:16:15.17,01:16:15.17,">> Jeff: MICHAEL, YOU'RE UP. >> HELLO, HI, GUYS."
1346,01:16:20.53,01:16:20.53,"DAWN AND COCHRAN, WHEN I HOOKED UP WITH YOU GUYS AT"
1347,01:16:24.57,01:16:24.57,THE SWAP AND STARTED WATCHING YOU AND KNEW YOU
1348,01:16:26.60,01:16:26.60,"WERE PLAYING THE SAME GAME, I WATCHED YOU GUYS"
1349,01:16:30.07,01:16:30.07,"STRATEGIZE TOGETHER, VOTE TOGETHER, BUT I FEEL THAT"
1350,01:16:33.83,01:16:33.83,"DAWN, YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PUNCH"
1351,01:16:37.20,01:16:37.20,GUT KIND OF THING. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE
1352,01:16:41.30,01:16:41.30,OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHY MAYBE COCHRAN IS GETTING OFF
1353,01:16:47.03,01:16:47.03,SCOT-FREE. WHY IS HE TO THE BEING
1354,01:16:49.07,01:16:49.07,CALLED A VILLAIN MAYBE THE WAY THAT YOU ARE?
1355,01:16:51.77,01:16:51.77,>> I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT COCHRAN AND I
1356,01:16:54.87,01:16:54.87,PLAYED THE GAME IS I DEVELOPED THE RELATIONSHIP
1357,01:16:58.40,01:16:58.40,WITH PEOPLE THAT GAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEEDED
1358,01:17:01.27,01:17:01.27,TO MAKE THE VOTE THAT WOULD TAKE PEOPLE OUT.
1359,01:17:03.97,01:17:03.97,>> SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE SAYING HE DOESN'T
1360,01:17:06.90,01:17:06.90,HAVE AS MUCH BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.
1361,01:17:08.47,01:17:08.47,>> I DON'T THINK HE HAS AS MUCH BLOOD OR AS MUCH
1362,01:17:11.47,01:17:11.47,RESPONSIBILITY. AND I DON'T THINK HE WOULD
1363,01:17:12.87,01:17:12.87,NECESSARILY BE HERE IF I HADN'T DEVELOPED THE
1364,01:17:15.60,01:17:15.60,RELATIONSHIP. IN MY OPINION THERE ARE A
1365,01:17:16.63,01:17:16.63,LOT OF DECISIONS IN THE GAME WHERE COCHRAN DIDN'T HAVE TO
1366,01:17:19.00,01:17:19.00,DO ANYTHING BUT KIND OF SHOW UP AND SAY HOW DO I VOTE?
1367,01:17:22.83,01:17:22.83,">> COCHRAN, I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU THINK ALL THAT"
1368,01:17:26.23,01:17:26.23,"DAWN IS GETTING IS WARRANTED, WHETHER SHE WARRANTS THE"
1369,01:17:31.30,01:17:31.30,"REACTIONS, I DON'T KNOW. IN FULL DISCLOSURE I'M HAPPY"
1370,01:17:34.40,01:17:34.40,SHE'S RECEIVING THE REACTIONS.
1371,01:17:35.73,01:17:35.73,">> THANKS, COCHRAN. >> I'M BEING HONEST."
1372,01:17:38.47,01:17:38.47,I'M TO THE GOING HIDE ANYTHING.
1373,01:17:40.13,01:17:40.13,I'M HAPPY THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VENOM TOWARDS DAWN.
1374,01:17:43.33,01:17:43.33,IN TERMS OF WHY I AM COMING OFF CLEANER.
1375,01:17:45.70,01:17:45.70,I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH DAWN'S ASSESSMENT.
1376,01:17:47.57,01:17:47.57,SHE DID SAYING WOULDN'T IT BE IN THE GAME IF IT WEREN'T
1377,01:17:50.17,01:17:50.17,HERE. CERTAINLY THERE IS A
1378,01:17:51.97,01:17:51.97,RECIPROCITY AND SYMBIOSIS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
1379,01:17:54.87,01:17:54.87,>> I DIDN'T SAY NOT IN THE GAME.
1380,01:17:55.87,01:17:55.87,>> YOU DID SAY THAT AT ONE POINT.
1381,01:17:57.60,01:17:57.60,THE PARANOIA THAT RAN RAM WANT-- RAMPANT WAS CRIPPLING
1382,01:18:02.87,01:18:02.87,TO THE ALLIANCE. >> I THINK A PARANOIA THAT
1383,01:18:05.13,01:18:05.13,PROBABLY WAS FOSTERED BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
1384,01:18:09.13,01:18:09.13,HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT WAS JUST
1385,01:18:11.53,01:18:11.53,DIFFICULT-- MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO THAN I REALIZED
1386,01:18:13.70,01:18:13.70,IT WAS GOING TO BE. I STILL DID IT.
1387,01:18:16.03,01:18:16.03,>> THAT'S JUST MY PORTION OF THE ANSWER PHASE I THINK.
1388,01:18:18.43,01:18:18.43,I DO FEEL YOU WERE AN ABSOLUTE HUGE ASSET IN TERMS
1389,01:18:20.87,01:18:20.87,OF GETTING INFORMATION. BUT I ACTUALLY MADE THE
1390,01:18:22.83,01:18:22.83,DECISIONS. IF I HADN'T BECOME YOUR
1391,01:18:24.60,01:18:24.60,"THERAPIST, I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE STILL IN THIS GAME."
1392,01:18:29.73,01:18:29.73,">> OKAY. >> Jeff: THANKS, MICHAEL."
1393,01:18:32.07,01:18:32.07,"REYNOLD, YOU'RE UP. >> DAWN, ALL RIGHT, I PRETTY"
1394,01:18:37.57,01:18:37.57,MUCH DISLIKED FROM YOU DAY ONE BECAUSE I WAS LIKE DAWN
1395,01:18:40.93,01:18:40.93,IS A COMPLETE FRAUD. >> OH.
1396,01:18:42.97,01:18:42.97,>> SHE IS THE FIRST ONE TO GIVE AN OVER EMPHATIC HUG IF
1397,01:18:47.37,01:18:47.37,"SOMEONE STUBS THEIR TOE, SHE'S THE ONE WHO LOOKS AT"
1398,01:18:50.77,01:18:50.77,YOU AND SAYS THAT IS HILARIOUS.
1399,01:18:52.57,01:18:52.57,">> YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO DO THAT."
1400,01:18:53.90,01:18:53.90,>> AND YOU ARE NOT EVEN LAUGHING AT THE JOKE.
1401,01:18:57.07,01:18:57.07,SO I THINK THAT YOU WERE DISENGINE BUSINESS.
1402,01:19:00.13,01:19:00.13,>> OKAY. >> AND THE CHARACTER THAT
1403,01:19:01.53,01:19:01.53,YOU CREATED WAS A FALSE CHARACTER.
1404,01:19:04.47,01:19:04.47,>> ALL THOSE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT MY PERSONALITY ARE
1405,01:19:06.50,01:19:06.50,ACTUALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE I'M NOT AWARE THAT MI-- IT
1406,01:19:09.03,01:19:09.03,SOUNDS LIKE ARE YOU SAYING PHONEY.
1407,01:19:10.77,01:19:10.77,">> I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE, THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU"
1408,01:19:13.30,01:19:13.30,FREE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME?
1409,01:19:14.67,01:19:14.67,">> YEAH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW -- DISH MEAN I HAVE --"
1410,01:19:18.50,01:19:18.50,>> JUST SHOOT ME STREET. >> I HAVE MULTIPLE THOUGHTS.
1411,01:19:23.03,01:19:23.03,>> THREE ADJECTIVES REYNOLD. >> OH.
1412,01:19:28.40,01:19:28.40,">> DO IT TOO ME, DAWN. >> I JUST AM TRYING TO THINK."
1413,01:19:35.57,01:19:35.57,>> DO IT. I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF
1414,01:19:36.97,01:19:36.97,"OTHER PEOPLE, DO IT FOR ME. >> I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF"
1415,01:19:40.40,01:19:40.40,"CHAUVINISTIC. >> YES, THANK YOU."
1416,01:19:42.17,01:19:42.17,>> I DO THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
1417,01:19:45.63,01:19:45.63,>> THERE WE GO. >> AND I THINK THAT
1418,01:19:47.60,01:19:47.60,SOMETIMES ARE YOU REALLY VULGAR.
1419,01:19:49.30,01:19:49.30,">> YES, SO I CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THAT COMPLIMENT THAT I"
1420,01:19:53.37,01:19:53.37,"HAVE THIS GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, WHICH I DO, AND"
1421,01:19:55.80,01:19:55.80,"BELIEVE YOU. >> YEAH, AGREED."
1422,01:19:57.10,01:19:57.10,>> BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME I'M A CHAUVINISTIC CRUDER GUY THAN
1423,01:19:59.87,01:19:59.87,YOU HANG OUT WITH AT THE CHURCH OF MORMON.
1424,01:20:03.27,01:20:03.27,AND LIKE-- THAT IS AWESOME. THAT HAS SET YOU FREE.
1425,01:20:06.70,01:20:06.70,>> AND I APPRECIATE-- NO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.
1426,01:20:08.73,01:20:08.73,BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT TRYING TO BE FAKE.
1427,01:20:11.13,01:20:11.13,>> SO WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS YOU CAN GO BACK AND BE A
1428,01:20:14.93,01:20:14.93,"GREAT PERSON BUT TELL THESE PEOPLE, I KICKED YOUR ASS."
1429,01:20:17.97,01:20:17.97,">> I KICKED YOUR ASS IN THIS GAME, BUT I STILL DO LOVE"
1430,01:20:21.07,01:20:21.07,YOU. >> AND I LIKED IT.
1431,01:20:23.93,01:20:23.93,">> A LITTLE BIT. >> A LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT."
1432,01:20:29.47,01:20:29.47,>> Jeff: ANDREA. >> YOU GUYS CAN ALL TAKE A

1434,01:20:38.33,01:20:38.33,AND MI JUST GRATEFUL I WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITH YOU GUYS.
1435,01:20:40.83,01:20:40.83,YOU BLINDSIDE IMMEDIATE WITH A HID ENIMMUNITY IDOL IN MY
1436,01:20:44.63,01:20:44.63,BAG AND IT WAS AWESOME. I'M NOT BITTER.
1437,01:20:46.90,01:20:46.90,I THINK IT IS GREAT THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE.
1438,01:20:49.20,01:20:49.20,"SO FIRST COCHRAN, MY QUESTION FOR SU IF YOU WERE"
1439,01:20:52.20,01:20:52.20,TO CHOOSE ONE ANIMAL THAT YOU FEEL YOU PLAYED THIS
1440,01:20:54.93,01:20:54.93,GAME MOST LIKE WHAT WOULD IT BE.
1441,01:20:56.63,01:20:56.63,">> PROBABLY I WOULD SAY A CHAM EELIAN, I WAS ABLE TO"
1442,01:21:04.17,01:21:04.17,CHANGE COLORS AT THE DROP OF A HAT.
1443,01:21:05.23,01:21:05.23,"IF SOMEBODY I THOUGHT WAS A TRUSTED ALLY, YOU KNOW,"
1444,01:21:07.90,01:21:07.90,"PHILLIP WAS ONE OF MY CLOSEST ALLY, A STEALTH ""R"""
1445,01:21:11.73,01:21:11.73,"US COLOURED CAMELIA, IT GUESS IT IS DEBANDED, I HAD"
1446,01:21:16.77,01:21:16.77,TO CHANGE MY COLOURS. I DID THAT WAS THE ADAPT
1447,01:21:19.20,01:21:19.20,ABILITY AND TIMING THAT WAS CRUCIAL TO MY GAME.
1448,01:21:20.83,01:21:20.83,I THINK I HAVE BEEN MORE WILLING AND ABLE TO CHANGE
1449,01:21:23.10,01:21:23.10,AT THE DROP A HAT AND THAT IS HOW I HAVE GOTTEN THIS
1450,01:21:26.07,01:21:26.07,FAR. >> AWESOME ANSWER.
1451,01:21:27.10,01:21:27.10,"DAWN, I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU."
1452,01:21:28.43,01:21:28.43,AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU DID
1453,01:21:30.50,01:21:30.50,PLAY A VERY STRATEGIC GAME. I THINK IF I WAS IN THE
1454,01:21:32.83,01:21:32.83,FINAL THREE I WOULD HAVE PLAYED SIMILAR TO YOU.
1455,01:21:34.80,01:21:34.80,I REALLY DEFINITELY TRIED TO CONNECT TO PEOPLE AND THEN
1456,01:21:37.67,01:21:37.67,WAS READY TO CUT THEM. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE
1457,01:21:39.73,01:21:39.73,COMING FROM. >> THANKS.
1458,01:21:41.10,01:21:41.10,">> THANK YOU, I'M PROUD OF YOU GUYS."

1462,01:21:53.33,01:21:53.33,AND HI. BUT ONE WAY THAT WE DID BOND
1463,01:21:56.73,01:21:56.73,WAS AT THE FAMILY VISIT. >> ABSOLUTELY.
1464,01:21:58.37,01:21:58.37,>> YOU KNOW. IN A WAY I FELT LIKE I GAVE
1465,01:22:00.80,01:22:00.80,YOU SOMETHING. AND THEN ALMOST INSTANTLY I
1466,01:22:03.60,01:22:03.60,FELT LIKE YOU TOOK SOMETHING FROM ME.
1467,01:22:05.50,01:22:05.50,>> YEAH. >> SO I WANT YOU TO REALLY
1468,01:22:08.70,01:22:08.70,SELL ME ON IT OF WHY I SHOULD GIVE TO YOU NOW.
1469,01:22:13.77,01:22:13.77,>> I DON'T KNOW-- IT KIND OF SCARES ME.
1470,01:22:16.17,01:22:16.17,I HAVE KIND OF DEVELOPED THIS SOCIOPATHIC ABILITY TO
1471,01:22:19.87,01:22:19.87,SEPARATE GAME AND EMOTION. BEYOND THIS GAME I'M WILLING
1472,01:22:21.73,01:22:21.73,TO PROVE MY GRATITUDE TO YOU BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT AN
1473,01:22:25.40,01:22:25.40,"EMOTIONAL GIFT YOU GAME TO ME, NOT A GAME PLAY GIFT."
1474,01:22:28.13,01:22:28.13,"IN TERMS OF TELLING YOU WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR ME, I"
1475,01:22:30.80,01:22:30.80,THINK BECAUSE YOU WERE A THREAT TO MY GAME AND I TOOK
1476,01:22:32.97,01:22:32.97,OUT A THREAT TO MY GAME. AND THAT IS I THINK THE CORE
