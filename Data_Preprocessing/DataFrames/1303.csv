6,00:00:17.71,00:00:17.71,>> PROBST: ...priorities were questioned.
7,00:00:19.12,00:00:19.12,>> Do you two want to a raised platform?
8,00:00:20.25,00:00:20.25,">> I thought it sounded nice. >> I know you do, but we have to"
9,00:00:23.17,00:00:23.17,"decide things as a group. >> PROBST: At Aitu, Billy"
10,00:00:27.67,00:00:27.67,"wasn't pulling his weight... >> If we lose Billy, we come"
11,00:00:31.62,00:00:31.62,back stronger than ever. >> PROBST: ...so Ozzy suggested
12,00:00:34.50,00:00:34.50,a bold plan to throw the challenge and oust Billy.
13,00:00:37.92,00:00:37.92,>> Billy's just dead weight. So we might as well cut our
14,00:00:40.42,00:00:40.42,losses now and get on with the game.
15,00:00:42.79,00:00:42.79,">> PROBST: J.P. was on board, but Cristina the cop was"
16,00:00:44.62,00:00:44.62,"skeptical. >> I'm thinking, you know, this"
17,00:00:46.62,00:00:46.62,doesn't seem right. I don't know if I can trust
18,00:00:48.62,00:00:48.62,Oscar any more. >> PROBST: But at the
19,00:00:50.42,00:00:50.42,"challenge... Puka's on the course, Raro's on"
20,00:00:52.38,00:00:52.38,"the course, Hiki's on the course."
21,00:00:54.25,00:00:54.25,...Ozzy's plan went into action.
22,00:00:56.54,00:00:56.54,Aitu completely unconcerned about this challenge.
23,00:00:59.04,00:00:59.04,"Puka, Raro, Hiki, all safe from tribal council."
24,00:01:04.96,00:01:04.96,Aitu came in dead last and chose Yul from the Puka tribe to
25,00:01:08.46,00:01:08.46,"go to Exile Island. >> Yul, boat's waiting for you"
26,00:01:11.50,00:01:11.50,now. >> PROBST: Before the tribes
27,00:01:13.75,00:01:13.75,"parted, Billy thought he and Candice made a connection."
28,00:01:20.42,00:01:20.42,"On Exile Island, Yul deciphered the clues and found the hidden"
29,00:01:23.67,00:01:23.67,"immunity idol. >> Oh, mama."
30,00:01:26.50,00:01:26.50,I found the immunity idol. If there's an opportunity
31,00:01:28.67,00:01:28.67,"where it can change the game, I'd use it."
32,00:01:31.21,00:01:31.21,">> PROBST: At Aitu's tribal council, Billy revealed a"
33,00:01:34.42,00:01:34.42,"secret. >> I fell in love in this game,"
34,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,love at first sight. Her name is Candice.
35,00:01:39.38,00:01:39.38,And in between... ( laughter )
36,00:01:42.12,00:01:42.12,>> PROBST: Candice from Raro tribe?
37,00:01:44.08,00:01:44.08,">> Yeah, after the last challenge, we sort of mouthed"
38,00:01:46.71,00:01:46.71,"the words ""I love you"" to one another, and so that was my"
39,00:01:48.54,00:01:48.54,prize. My prize was her.
40,00:01:50.50,00:01:50.50,">> PROBST: In the end, Billy's tribemates cut him loose."
41,00:01:52.96,00:01:52.96,"Billy, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left."

47,00:03:29.83,00:03:29.83,">> You know, anything's possible."
48,00:03:31.33,00:03:31.33,Maybe he really had a crush on her.
49,00:03:33.12,00:03:33.12,Maybe she was playing him though.
50,00:03:35.12,00:03:35.12,I don't think she would have said...
51,00:03:38.17,00:03:38.17,>> I think she was going... >> You know what?
52,00:03:40.50,00:03:40.50,"They never had any kind of, like, contact or communication."
53,00:03:43.50,00:03:43.50,">> Study him, the way he is around the camp, all that kind"
54,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,"of stuff, I don't know. All the stuff that came out of"
55,00:03:51.25,00:03:51.25,Billy's mouth tonight was just ridiculous.
56,00:03:54.17,00:03:54.17,I don't even know... words can't describe what... about the
57,00:03:56.62,00:03:56.62,"Candice situation. And if it's true, it's true."
58,00:03:59.38,00:03:59.38,But it's not true. >> I was on the way.
59,00:04:31.62,00:04:31.62,Like we stop at this Vietnamese restaurant because my wife and I
60,00:04:34.25,00:04:34.25,was hired by this restaurant guy.
61,00:04:36.25,00:04:36.25,"And this old man, he said, ""I come to United States, I'm so"
62,00:04:39.38,00:04:39.38,"lonely. All my friends are in Vietnam."""
63,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33,"He's, like, 50-something. And he's just missing the old"
64,00:04:45.12,00:04:45.12,"days. ""But I come to United States"

69,00:04:56.21,00:04:56.21,"He goes, ""What?"" 15 and 16."
70,00:04:58.17,00:04:58.17,You think in a couple more years they'll be in Iraq?
71,00:05:00.25,00:05:00.25,"I'm sorry, for what? ( laughs )"
72,00:05:03.42,00:05:03.42,You are Vietnamese. You should know better about
73,00:05:05.12,00:05:05.12,war. You should know all about war.
74,00:05:07.50,00:05:07.50,>> I have had sort of a coming to Jesus in my own mind with
75,00:05:11.46,00:05:11.46,Cao Boi. The guy just does not shut up.

77,00:05:19.21,00:05:19.21,>> So what if you go to college?

79,00:05:22.25,00:05:22.25,College. Unless you're a senator's
80,00:05:24.21,00:05:24.21,"children or congressman's children, you're going."
81,00:05:26.96,00:05:26.96,Unless are you Mr. Bush's children or your lineage is
82,00:05:29.50,00:05:29.50,blue or something. >> I don't think he's all there.
83,00:05:32.08,00:05:32.08,"I really in my heart of hearts don't think he's all there, and"
84,00:05:35.17,00:05:35.17,will ever be there. Unless he's medicated.
85,00:05:45.96,00:05:45.96,">> ""Your biggest challenge yet will require brawn."
86,00:05:49.12,00:05:49.12,But if you're thinking wisely it could be the winning tribe
87,00:05:51.75,00:05:51.75,you're on. Use your powers of observation
88,00:05:54.50,00:05:54.50,"and your intuition, too. You may get a better life at"
89,00:05:57.62,00:05:57.62,"camp or just head home feeling blue."""
90,00:06:01.79,00:06:01.79,">> Just getting up, we got a challenge early."
91,00:06:03.88,00:06:03.88,Morning challenge of some kind. And the tribe is strong.
92,00:06:07.29,00:06:07.29,"You know, we haven't lost yet. We're one of the two tribes"
93,00:06:09.42,00:06:09.42,that hasn't lost anything. I went to Exile Island.
94,00:06:11.79,00:06:11.79,We came back and won the next challenge.
95,00:06:13.88,00:06:13.88,That didn't really weaken us. So we're okay.
96,00:06:15.88,00:06:15.88,And we're ready to rock 'n' roll.
97,00:06:17.50,00:06:17.50,"We're doing great. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."

191,00:13:39.17,00:13:39.17,I thought it was okay just for the fact that whether it's
192,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,"good or bad, it brings a attention to it and makes people"
193,00:13:44.42,00:13:44.42,think. I just think that's a good
194,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,thing. >> The way our tribe is blended
195,00:13:48.29,00:13:48.29,"at this point, it's all about people and who we are and what"
196,00:13:50.88,00:13:50.88,we bring to the table. You really don't see color.
197,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,You see the heart of that individual and what they're
198,00:13:56.88,00:13:56.88,doing to make your tribe stronger.
199,00:14:00.21,00:14:00.21,And that's what this is all about.
200,00:14:02.62,00:14:02.62,>> Adam's a snorer. >> I don't snore.
201,00:14:05.04,00:14:05.04,( everyone talking at once ) >> We're back to America.
202,00:14:08.71,00:14:08.71,We're a melting pot. I love it.
203,00:14:11.00,00:14:11.00,"Everyone's all mixed back together, and I just think it's"
204,00:14:13.42,00:14:13.42,"great. >> First and foremost, it's"
205,00:14:17.21,00:14:17.21,"going to be all smiles and ""Pleasure to meet you"" and"
206,00:14:19.17,00:14:19.17,"""Glad you're here."" But in the back of your mind,"
207,00:14:21.75,00:14:21.75,"it's a game, and you're in it to win it for yourself."
208,00:14:24.50,00:14:24.50,"And first and foremost: cold, hard cash."
209,00:14:27.12,00:14:27.12,">> One, two, three! ( cheers and applause )"
210,00:14:31.96,00:14:31.96,">> I'm so excited. >> Welcome, welcome, welcome,"
211,00:14:37.21,00:14:37.21,welcome. ( cheers and applause )
212,00:14:40.25,00:14:40.25,You're home! You're home!
213,00:14:42.12,00:14:42.12,"Welcome. >> First off, you guys did an"
214,00:14:44.67,00:14:44.67,amazing job. This is fantastic.
215,00:14:47.25,00:14:47.25,>> This is beautiful. >> Is it watertight?
216,00:14:49.62,00:14:49.62,>> We have a wall. Where's our wall?
217,00:14:52.67,00:14:52.67,Go back. >> There's a wall in there.
218,00:14:56.21,00:14:56.21,>> We felt that Cecilia and Ozzy were very welcoming.
219,00:14:58.50,00:14:58.50,They were just so excited. Cecilia was the hostess.
220,00:15:01.46,00:15:01.46,"She stood there and gave us the spiel, point this out, point"
221,00:15:04.54,00:15:04.54,"that out, do that, do this, this is what we got."
222,00:15:07.08,00:15:07.08,Mi casa es su casa. They're Hispanic-- mi casa es
223,00:15:10.54,00:15:10.54,su casa. That's beautiful.
224,00:15:14.71,00:15:14.71,We got our own little torch to light up the whole place.
225,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,( laughter ) >> I'm definitely so happy
226,00:15:23.04,00:15:23.04,about the transition in this game.
227,00:15:26.29,00:15:26.29,I definitely feel a change of energy here.
228,00:15:28.38,00:15:28.38,I feel the vibration from other people on my new tribe that I
229,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,didn't have the same in my old tribe.
230,00:15:35.42,00:15:35.42,>> You're not Asian. I love it.
231,00:15:38.25,00:15:38.25,"I think you're fine, okay. I think you're awesome."
232,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,>> I'm really excited about just having fun people to hang
233,00:15:45.25,00:15:45.25,"out with. >> Okay, so I have to ask you"
234,00:15:47.71,00:15:47.71,something. Please don't be offended.
235,00:15:50.62,00:15:50.62,"Billy, when he left-- and I'm just curious-- Billy, when he"
236,00:15:53.50,00:15:53.50,"left, he said that you guys are, like, love at first sight."
237,00:15:56.92,00:15:56.92,>> Love at first sight? >> Yes.
238,00:15:59.08,00:15:59.08,And my jaw just dropped and I was like...
239,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,>> You and Billy? >> That is the weirdest thing I
240,00:16:03.12,00:16:03.12,ever heard. So I got to ask you...
241,00:16:05.12,00:16:05.12,">> I mean, what did he mean by that?"
242,00:16:07.67,00:16:07.67,">> He said before the... we left the last challenge, we"
243,00:16:11.12,00:16:11.12,"mouthed the words ""I love you"" to each other."
244,00:16:13.54,00:16:13.54,">> No, he's... >> Oh, no."
245,00:16:16.25,00:16:16.25,">> Were you saying good luck, or..."
246,00:16:18.42,00:16:18.42,>> No. He said at the challenge or
247,00:16:21.29,00:16:21.29,"whatever at the very end, he just looked over to me and"
248,00:16:24.29,00:16:24.29,"Parvati, and he was like, ""I'm dead."""
249,00:16:26.25,00:16:26.25,"And I was like, ""I'm sorry, that really sucks"" or whatever."
250,00:16:29.29,00:16:29.29,"I was like, ""We love you."" Like, our team, you know?"
251,00:16:31.83,00:16:31.83,I didn't mean it like that. >> He took it as you guys had a
252,00:16:34.33,00:16:34.33,love connection at first sight. He said that that was his
253,00:16:38.71,00:16:38.71,"million dollars, to get to be with you."
254,00:16:41.96,00:16:41.96,"Or like you know, know you, like, be on the same team with"
255,00:16:44.71,00:16:44.71,"you. >> You lead him on, Candice."
256,00:16:47.17,00:16:47.17,">> No, I did not. ( laughter )"
257,00:16:49.04,00:16:49.04,">> You flirt, you. >> You led him on."
258,00:16:51.17,00:16:51.17,">> Oh, please. >> We've got to make a little"
259,00:17:01.62,00:17:01.62,fire today. Oh that's good.
260,00:17:07.33,00:17:07.33,"Oh, that one's really good. >> What are they doing?"
261,00:17:12.46,00:17:12.46,">> I don't know, bonding. ( laughter )"
262,00:17:15.29,00:17:15.29,>> We men. >> There are so many men on
263,00:17:18.04,00:17:18.04,this tribe now. It seems like we got all the
264,00:17:20.17,00:17:20.17,really big buff guys. I'm absolutely going to flirt
265,00:17:24.21,00:17:24.21,with them. Get them on my good side.
266,00:17:26.46,00:17:26.46,"It's what I do best. Aw, baby monkey."
267,00:17:30.58,00:17:30.58,">> Yeah, am I your baby monkey? >> I already had Adam from the"
268,00:17:34.83,00:17:34.83,beginning. >> You have water in there?
269,00:17:37.96,00:17:37.96,>> I was drawn to Nate in the first place just because he's
270,00:17:40.54,00:17:40.54,"so, like, outgoing and funny and kind of charming."
271,00:17:44.29,00:17:44.29,"So I decided to work him, just for starters."
272,00:17:49.50,00:17:49.50,"Your pants are falling off, Nate."
273,00:17:56.71,00:17:56.71,">> Lure him into my web, chomp and suck his blood."
274,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,( laughs ) >> May have cooked these too
275,00:18:07.79,00:18:07.79,"long, Cao Boi. Cao Boi, how are you doing?"
276,00:18:11.12,00:18:11.12,>> What? >> I said how are you doing.
277,00:18:12.75,00:18:12.75,">> I'm doing fine, sir. >> That's beautiful."
278,00:18:45.17,00:18:45.17,">> Cool. >> I trust Yul, I trust Candice."
279,00:18:50.33,00:18:50.33,>> I totally agree. No question that the four of
280,00:18:53.25,00:18:53.25,us should be... >> Then we were thinking of
281,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,"adding Flicka to make it five. >> Believe me, I can get her"
282,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,to do whatever we need her to do.
283,00:19:00.00,00:19:00.00,">> Do you think... >> I'll just say to her, ""You,"
284,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,"me and Candice, we're going to stay together and we're going"
285,00:19:04.50,00:19:04.50,"to deal with these other two people, okay?"""
286,00:19:06.83,00:19:06.83,>> I hear you. >> I knew Becky was the person
287,00:19:09.21,00:19:09.21,I had to get to first. But she was the key.
288,00:19:11.46,00:19:11.46,"She came right to me. She said, ""Yul and I would like"
289,00:19:14.25,00:19:14.25,"to get together with you and Candice."""
290,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,"I said, ""Great."" I said, ""I believe that I have"
291,00:19:17.83,00:19:17.83,"Flicka,"" hoping that she would say ""Okay, great."""
292,00:19:27.00,00:19:27.00,>> I think we can align with a couple of the Asians.
293,00:19:30.08,00:19:30.08,I think that's going to be able to happen.
294,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,"So we'll have a good, strong five, I'm hoping."
295,00:19:34.71,00:19:34.71,All right? But if anybody else approaches
296,00:19:37.29,00:19:37.29,"you, just say, ""Oh, yeah, whatever,"" or ""I'm not thinking"
297,00:19:39.62,00:19:39.62,"about it."" Just..."
298,00:19:41.88,00:19:41.88,>> I'm not thinking about it. I'm just sitting here.
299,00:19:44.92,00:19:44.92,>> I am thinking about it. So you don't have to think about
300,00:19:47.67,00:19:47.67,it. Let me think about it.
301,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,But I'm thinking about it. Stay with me and Candice and
302,00:19:52.54,00:19:52.54,we'll take these other two and the five of us will go to the
303,00:19:55.25,00:19:55.25,merge. >> Jonathan wants me to stay in
304,00:19:58.08,00:19:58.08,"the alliance from our original tribe, in which I don't really"
305,00:20:02.04,00:20:02.04,necessarily feel that comfortable because I didn't
306,00:20:04.62,00:20:04.62,feel that comfortable in that tribe to begin with.
307,00:20:07.25,00:20:07.25,>> We're strong. We'll go all the way.
308,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"I mean, seriously, we'll make it to the top five."
309,00:20:11.67,00:20:11.67,"It's going to be cool, all right?"
310,00:20:14.04,00:20:14.04,>> All right. I'm just kind of playing my
311,00:20:16.54,00:20:16.54,cards like I'm not really thinking about alliances.
312,00:20:19.21,00:20:19.21,I'm just here to make friends and see what happens and try
313,00:20:22.21,00:20:22.21,"to, you know, go as long as I can without feeling fake."
314,00:20:28.88,00:20:28.88,">> Candice and I, we were talking and so she... her and"
315,00:20:31.71,00:20:31.71,"Jonathan basically were pretty strong, too, and so, it's just,"
316,00:20:35.04,00:20:35.04,"you know, the perfect four. But then we were trying to"
317,00:20:37.92,00:20:37.92,"figure out our fifth person. So Jonathan mentioned Flicka,"
318,00:20:40.33,00:20:40.33,and then we were deciding between Ozzy and Cecilia.
319,00:20:43.75,00:20:43.75,So I don't know if her and Ozzy already have an alliance or not
320,00:20:47.42,00:20:47.42,because they are two and they... >> I'm sure that right now
321,00:20:51.00,00:20:51.00,they're kind of expanding a little bit because they
322,00:20:53.71,00:20:53.71,realize that they're coming into this with fewer numbers.
323,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,"And so, I mean, if we went along tribal lines, I mean, those"
324,00:20:58.08,00:20:58.08,people would be voted out along with Sundra.
325,00:21:01.04,00:21:01.04,"I've to tell you something. And again, you know, I'm"
326,00:21:04.17,00:21:04.17,telling this because I totally trust you.
327,00:21:05.79,00:21:05.79,">> Right, right. >> This is sort of like my"
328,00:21:08.04,00:21:08.04,"gesture that, like, I trust you and, like, all the stuff we"
329,00:21:11.17,00:21:11.17,"talked about, I really believe in."
330,00:21:13.25,00:21:13.25,I found the idol. >> That's so awesome.
331,00:21:16.04,00:21:16.04,>> Yeah. >> First day or second day?
332,00:21:18.67,00:21:18.67,">> I found it... well, I found it overnight just thinking"
333,00:21:21.04,00:21:21.04,about the clues and kind of working it out.
334,00:21:23.08,00:21:23.08,"But you know, if we can somehow turn the game around and get us"
335,00:21:25.46,00:21:25.46,"ahead, you know, you are in a situation where I could save"
336,00:21:28.83,00:21:28.83,"your butt, I mean, I'll do it. >> I appreciate it."
337,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,I trust you. You know that I trust you.
338,00:21:33.38,00:21:33.38,">> Becky and I have, I think, a tight bond and strong alliance"
339,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,"coming out of our Puka tribe. You know, I think it's a huge"
340,00:21:38.62,00:21:38.62,advantage in this game to have somebody that you can absolutely
341,00:21:41.17,00:21:41.17,"trust. And I think, given our"
342,00:21:43.25,00:21:43.25,"backgrounds and our common interests, I felt comfortable"
343,00:21:45.46,00:21:45.46,disclosing the information to her.
344,00:21:47.42,00:21:47.42,>> I am not going to tell anybody.
345,00:21:49.17,00:21:49.17,I don't think you should tell anybody again.
346,00:21:50.46,00:21:50.46,"Oh, I'm so excited! I'm so proud of you."
347,00:21:53.58,00:21:53.58,"That's so awesome. >> Oh, my God!"
348,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,>> He has a what? >> Octopus.
349,00:22:34.33,00:22:34.33,">> I felt like the man! I was, ""What, octopus, what do"
350,00:22:37.96,00:22:37.96,"you got now?"" It's a good feeling."
351,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,"No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. >> Pull it back."
352,00:22:46.21,00:22:46.21,Strong. >> Look at him sucking me.
353,00:22:50.71,00:22:50.71,>> I told you. ( laughter )
354,00:22:54.21,00:22:54.21,>> He is going home! >> Pull that head back.
355,00:23:01.04,00:23:01.04,">> Ha, ha. >> Yeah, Nate."
356,00:23:04.00,00:23:04.00,>> How did you find him? >> I don't think the guys or
357,00:23:06.12,00:23:06.12,"anyone really expected me to do it, to come back with"
358,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,"something, and something so heavy."
359,00:23:10.62,00:23:10.62,"Looking at it, you know, just hanging, I was like, ""Yeah,"
360,00:23:13.08,00:23:13.08,"we're eating this fool tonight."" >> We got dinner, ladies."
361,00:23:17.25,00:23:17.25,>> It's huge. >> How did you get that?
362,00:23:19.54,00:23:19.54,">> I had a spear, and I couldn't let go of the spear"
363,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,because he would swim off with it.
364,00:23:23.04,00:23:23.04,He was strong. >> That is a lot of meat.
365,00:23:26.12,00:23:26.12,You need it. You could probably eat that
366,00:23:28.50,00:23:28.50,whole thing yourself. >> Probably.
367,00:23:58.54,00:23:58.54,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
368,00:24:00.71,00:24:00.71,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, for"
369,00:24:03.54,00:24:03.54,"today's challenge, each tribe will begin clipped together by a"
370,00:24:07.04,00:24:07.04,"rope. In addition, each of you will"
371,00:24:09.29,00:24:09.29,be carrying a 15-pound sandbag on your back.
372,00:24:12.88,00:24:12.88,You will start on opposite sides of the course.
373,00:24:15.75,00:24:15.75,"On my go, you will race through knee-deep water attempting to"
374,00:24:20.25,00:24:20.25,"catch the other tribe. When you get tired, and some of"
375,00:24:23.92,00:24:23.92,"you will, it's okay to opt out of the challenge."
376,00:24:26.12,00:24:26.12,"But first, you have to take your 15 pounds and give it to"
377,00:24:29.21,00:24:29.21,another tribe member who is now carrying twice as much weight.
378,00:24:33.12,00:24:33.12,First tribe to catch the other tribe and tackle one of their
379,00:24:36.96,00:24:36.96,"tribe members to the ground wins immunity, is safe at least"
380,00:24:41.21,00:24:41.21,one more day here in the Cook Islands.
381,00:24:44.17,00:24:44.17,"Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody going home."
382,00:24:48.25,00:24:48.25,There is one more element to this challenge.
383,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,The details are in the note. It'll be revealed after the
384,00:24:52.92,00:24:52.92,challenge is over. Make sense?
385,00:24:55.75,00:24:55.75,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Get suited up, we'll"
386,00:24:57.75,00:24:57.75,"go. Here we go, for immunity."
387,00:25:01.62,00:25:01.62,"Survivors, ready! Go!"
388,00:25:11.58,00:25:11.58,This is an endurance challenge. It is going to wear you out.
389,00:25:18.29,00:25:18.29,Water is almost knee-deep on everybody.
390,00:25:21.88,00:25:21.88,Hard to walk through. Both tribes have big guys at
391,00:25:26.92,00:25:26.92,the end. Try to prevent easy tackles.
392,00:25:33.67,00:25:33.67,Both tribes have strong guys at the front to make the tackles.
393,00:25:40.96,00:25:40.96,Aitu made up just a little ground on that round.
394,00:25:45.08,00:25:45.08,"Cecilia drops out, Sundra drops out, Candice drops out, Becky"
395,00:25:50.50,00:25:50.50,dropping out. Aitu now down to five members.
396,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,Bold strategy move for Aitu. All of their men now with 30
397,00:25:57.46,00:25:57.46,pounds. Stephannie dropping out for
398,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,Raro. >> PROBST: Cristina dropping out
399,00:26:12.08,00:26:12.08,for Raro. Adam takes her weight.
400,00:26:14.62,00:26:14.62,Jenny dropping out for Raro. Aitu still with a bit of a lead.
401,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,Jessica dropping out. She's giving her weight to
402,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,"Jonathan. He's got three bags now, 45"
403,00:26:24.29,00:26:24.29,pounds of sand. Parvati dropping out for Raro.
404,00:26:30.17,00:26:30.17,"Rebecca, the only woman left in this challenge."
405,00:26:34.04,00:26:34.04,"Aitu is down to four guys-- Ozzy, Jonathan, Cao Boi and Yul"
406,00:26:39.29,00:26:39.29,shouldering a lot of weight. Jonathan going to give 15
407,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,"pounds to Ozzy. Raro making up a lot of time,"
408,00:26:51.46,00:26:51.46,starting to close in on Aitu. Aitu has no options left.
409,00:26:56.83,00:26:56.83,Jonathan can hardly walk. Cao Boi needs to be helped by
410,00:27:00.83,00:27:00.83,"Yul. Rebecca finally dropping out, a"
411,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,key player in helping Raro get a lead.
412,00:27:08.08,00:27:08.08,"We are now even, four members each."
413,00:27:13.29,00:27:13.29,"J.P., Nate, Brad, Adam closing the gap with each step."
414,00:27:24.17,00:27:24.17,">> Give it all you got. Go, go!"
415,00:27:27.62,00:27:27.62,>> PROBST: Raro making a go of it.
416,00:27:34.46,00:27:34.46,"J.P., Nate, Adam, Brad. Yul going to try to fight them"
417,00:27:39.58,00:27:39.58,off as long as he can. But Cao Boi's too weak.
418,00:27:44.25,00:27:44.25,This challenge is over! Raro wins immunity!
419,00:27:48.21,00:27:48.21,"( cheers ) Raro, congratulations."
420,00:28:00.04,00:28:00.04,"( cheers and applause ) Safe from the vote, guaranteed"
421,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,at least one more day out here. There is one more element to
422,00:28:07.96,00:28:07.96,this challenge. I'll read the note.
423,00:28:10.75,00:28:10.75,"""The winning tribe will choose one member from the losing"
424,00:28:15.54,00:28:15.54,"tribe to go to Exile Island,"" which means the person you"
425,00:28:21.67,00:28:21.67,choose to send to Exile Island will miss tribal council
426,00:28:25.75,00:28:25.75,tonight. You are keeping somebody in
427,00:28:28.04,00:28:28.04,this game. A lot of ways to play this
428,00:28:30.54,00:28:30.54,strategically. Figure out who it is going to
429,00:28:33.04,00:28:33.04,be. Do you have your decision?
430,00:28:35.92,00:28:35.92,>> Candice. >> PROBST: It was unanimous.
431,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"Candice, boat will pick you up, have your stuff for you."
432,00:28:43.08,00:28:43.08,"Head on out. Okay, Raro, you guys are safe"
433,00:28:48.67,00:28:48.67,from the vote. Everybody's good.
434,00:28:51.79,00:28:51.79,"Aitu, we have a date tonight at tribal council."
435,00:28:54.17,00:28:54.17,One of the eight of you will be going home.
436,00:28:56.46,00:28:56.46,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to
437,00:28:58.38,00:28:58.38,be. Head on back to camp.
438,00:29:24.46,00:29:24.46,>> Can we just take one second and think of why they picked
439,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,Candice? >> I don't think they would
440,00:29:28.79,00:29:28.79,"perceive her as being the strongest physically, so I"
441,00:29:30.92,00:29:30.92,think they're just protecting her.
442,00:29:33.00,00:29:33.00,>> They're trying to protect her from us voting her off?
443,00:29:36.12,00:29:36.12,>> Candice went to Exile Island. It has a huge effect on our
444,00:29:39.08,00:29:39.08,"plans. Prior to this, we had an"
445,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,"alliance going on between myself, Jonathan, Becky,"
446,00:29:44.42,00:29:44.42,"Candice, and we were pretty confident that with the four of"
447,00:29:47.88,00:29:47.88,us pulling in one other person we would have a numbers
448,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,advantage. But now it doesn't look to be
449,00:29:52.50,00:29:52.50,the case. And actually...
450,00:29:58.08,00:29:58.08,">> I need you guys, too. We all need each other."
451,00:30:00.08,00:30:00.08,We just need to win. >> But we have to obviously
452,00:30:02.75,00:30:02.75,write down some... >> We have to let Becky go.
453,00:30:05.62,00:30:05.62,>> Okay. >> I think Becky is the weak
454,00:30:07.96,00:30:07.96,link. >> All right.
455,00:30:13.25,00:30:13.25,">> Cao Boi said alliance with us, he said we're good, the"
456,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,"girls are good. He said he really liked you,"
457,00:30:20.21,00:30:20.21,"you know, everybody... We got all ( inaudible )."
458,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,I say we get rid of Becky. Becky is seriously plotting.
459,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,>> All we need is five. We are all voting for Becky.
460,00:30:32.79,00:30:32.79,"Cao Boi, myself, Cecilia, Sundra and Flicka seem to have"
461,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"some sort of an agreement, and we'll see if it stands."
462,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,">> Jonathan, what are you doing? >> Let's..."
463,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,Come here. Let's...
464,00:30:59.25,00:30:59.25,I'll check in with you. >> No more talking.
465,00:31:05.50,00:31:05.50,We're done. >> I thought I had Flicka
466,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,handled. I thought she was with me.
467,00:31:31.88,00:31:31.88,"But she's not. She's doing her own thing, and"
468,00:31:34.08,00:31:34.08,I don't know how easy or hard it's going to be to convince
469,00:31:36.79,00:31:36.79,her otherwise. So we've got a serious problem
470,00:31:38.92,00:31:38.92,here. Where do we stand right now?
471,00:31:41.75,00:31:41.75,"It's you, me, Becky and that's it."
472,00:31:44.33,00:31:44.33,We don't know where Sundra's at.
473,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,We don't know where Cao Boi's at.
474,00:31:47.50,00:31:47.50,And Flicka is going to be probably impossible to switch.
475,00:31:49.83,00:31:49.83,">> Really? >> We're good, right, from what"
476,00:31:51.71,00:31:51.71,"we said. >> Yeah, yeah, we need to stick"
477,00:31:53.46,00:31:53.46,with it. But Jonathan is just worried
478,00:31:55.92,00:31:55.92,because I'm not for sure saying that I'm a part of their
479,00:31:59.12,00:31:59.12,alliance because I don't want to be wishy washy.
480,00:32:01.25,00:32:01.25,>> You're just going to follow your gut.
481,00:32:03.75,00:32:03.75,>> We just have to make it through tonight. 
482,00:32:05.67,00:32:05.67,We've got to get Flicka or Cao Boi to vote for Cecilia.
483,00:32:07.92,00:32:07.92,And it's risky because if we don't know that they are rock
484,00:32:10.38,00:32:10.38,"solid going to vote our way, then you and I put our necks way"
485,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,out on the line. Trying to convince Flicka and
486,00:32:19.38,00:32:19.38,Cao Boi to vote with us is the key.
487,00:32:22.08,00:32:22.08,"If not, then all bets are off and it's going to be a whole"
488,00:32:25.96,00:32:25.96,different kettle of fish. All I'm concerned about is
489,00:32:28.83,00:32:28.83,making it to the merger. Everybody you like is going to
490,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,"get voted off. >> I know, it's not about that,"
491,00:32:35.42,00:32:35.42,though. It's about having trust in the
492,00:32:37.50,00:32:37.50,people that you have a connection with.
493,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,">> Okay, so I thought you and I had a tight thing."
494,00:32:42.58,00:32:42.58,So we don't have such a tight thing.
495,00:32:44.38,00:32:44.38,Do we not trust each other? We're talking like adults.
496,00:32:46.38,00:32:46.38,>> I'm sorry. We have to let Becky go in
497,00:32:48.58,00:32:48.58,total fairness. She's the weak link.
498,00:32:50.33,00:32:50.33,Then we'll lose another one. >> She's not a weak link.
499,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,>> She is. She a princess out here.
500,00:32:54.08,00:32:54.08,You pay attention. She's a princess out here.
501,00:32:56.12,00:32:56.12,"I just watch and I just... >> But she's not... she's not,"
502,00:32:58.46,00:32:58.46,"like, weak. She's strong."
503,00:33:00.62,00:33:00.62,I think she has been very strong and decisive on the
504,00:33:02.58,00:33:02.58,"challenges. I think if you look at Cecilia,"
505,00:33:05.00,00:33:05.00,"she hasn't been that strong. She's good at puzzles, but"
506,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,physically she hasn't been that strong.
507,00:33:09.50,00:33:09.50,">> If five of us vote for Cecilia tonight, okay, and three"
508,00:33:12.88,00:33:12.88,"of you vote for Becky, then all of a sudden you're on the"
509,00:33:16.04,00:33:16.04,"outside and, boom, you're gone. >> If we get rid of Cecilia,"
510,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,"we'll have our numbers, okay? We can decide later on whether"
511,00:33:23.54,00:33:23.54,"we need to draw Becky, you, Jonathan, Flicka."
512,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,That's five. That's a solid five.
513,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33,">> That's still not the point, though."
514,00:33:32.58,00:33:32.58,">> Well, what is the point? I guess we're talking apples"
515,00:33:34.38,00:33:34.38,"and oranges. >> Yeah, we kind of are,"
516,00:33:36.17,00:33:36.17,because I'm just thinking she's the weaker link and I'm not
517,00:33:39.58,00:33:39.58,there. >> I'm trying to think ahead of
518,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,that. >> I'm not thinking ahead.
519,00:33:43.58,00:33:43.58,I'm not... >> But this is a game.
520,00:33:45.17,00:33:45.17,"This is like a chess game. >> Yeah, right."
521,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,>> This is a 30 day... we have 30 more days ahead of
522,00:33:49.38,00:33:49.38,us. You can't just think about
523,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,tomorrow. You have to put yourself in a
524,00:33:52.79,00:33:52.79,position that you can be there in 30 days.
525,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,You have to think about that now.
526,00:33:55.92,00:33:55.92,">> Uh-huh. >> I mean, because otherwise"
527,00:33:57.71,00:33:57.71,you won't be there. >> Uh-huh.
528,00:34:03.50,00:34:03.50,Hmm. I don't know.
529,00:34:05.75,00:34:05.75,I have to think about it still. >> We've got to stick tight.
530,00:34:09.75,00:34:09.75,">> You present your point and, okay, I'll listen to you."
531,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,>> I don't like the scheming of man.
532,00:34:15.25,00:34:15.25,I really don't like that at all. I feel like I've always been
533,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,blessed. Maybe this time I'm wrong.
534,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,">> No matter what they said, I said, ""I'm going to talk to"
535,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,"Jessica first."" Okay."
536,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,>> I have a hard time trusting...
537,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,>> I don't trust Jonathan. >> I don't trust Jonathan.
538,00:34:30.00,00:34:30.00,>> He's manipulative. >> I had a good talk with her.
539,00:34:33.92,00:34:33.92,She doesn't like the idea of playing the game that way.
540,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,">> But Jonathan has a point, the numbers game."
541,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,We have to make it to the merger.
542,00:34:41.29,00:34:41.29,We can play the game some more. >> I don't want to be picked
543,00:34:43.33,00:34:43.33,"off. >> I know, but they are playing"
544,00:34:45.04,00:34:45.04,bad. You are not part of the crowd.
545,00:34:47.12,00:34:47.12,"I'm not part of the crowd, period."
546,00:34:48.71,00:34:48.71,We're just stuck in this... >> Now what do you do?
547,00:34:52.04,00:34:52.04,I don't know what to do. I'm getting all wrapped up in
548,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,"this whole drama. I realize it's a numbers game,"
549,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,"but I have a lot of respect for Ceci, so I don't know."
550,00:35:01.79,00:35:01.79,"It's so hard. I'm like, ahh!"
551,00:35:08.67,00:35:08.67,">> Two ways to play the game: ""I like you, so I'm not going"
552,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,"to vote for you,"" or ""Sorry, I like you, but I got to vote for"
553,00:35:14.67,00:35:14.67,"you because I want to go further."""
554,00:35:17.21,00:35:17.21,"We have two different philosophies, and it's a war."
555,00:35:19.50,00:35:19.50,I don't know. We'll see how convincing I've
556,00:35:22.33,00:35:22.33,been. >> PROBST: Go ahead and have a
557,00:35:38.79,00:35:38.79,seat. So let's talk about the merge.
558,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,"Jonathan, in this case, the tribes have been divided based"
559,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,on ethnicity. Did that add anything to the
560,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,merge? >> I didn't think so.
561,00:35:52.38,00:35:52.38,"Honestly, I didn't. I think the captains selected"
562,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,the strongest people they could given the parameters.
563,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,We had a sense of who was strong and I'm actually really
564,00:35:59.88,00:35:59.88,pleased with the way the merge went.
565,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,">> PROBST: Sundra, as the only person from one tribe, you"
566,00:36:04.67,00:36:04.67,suddenly can become extremely powerful as everybody now wants
567,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,your vote because you have no allegiance to anyone.
568,00:36:11.38,00:36:11.38,">> Yeah, I mean, you could say you are either vulnerable or"
569,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,"valuable, and I don't give credit to either."
570,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,"I just try to be there and just use my gut to say, ""Okay,"
571,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,"this is what I should do,"" because, as you know, there's"
572,00:36:22.42,00:36:22.42,no way to guarantee the results of playing this game.
573,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,">> PROBST: Yul, assess this tribe."
574,00:36:28.29,00:36:28.29,What do you think would be the best direction for this tribe
575,00:36:30.54,00:36:30.54,to head? >> My sense is that some people
576,00:36:33.12,00:36:33.12,have different priorities in terms of what they are looking
577,00:36:35.54,00:36:35.54,for out of being here. I think some people are
578,00:36:38.04,00:36:38.04,strategizing and trying to make alliances and came here to play
579,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,"hard to win the game. I think other people came here,"
580,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,"you know, hoping that this is going to be a personally"
581,00:36:45.71,00:36:45.71,fulfilling experience for everyone.
582,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,">> PROBST: And Jonathan, nothing wrong or right about"
583,00:36:50.58,00:36:50.58,either one of those ends of the continuum.
584,00:36:52.96,00:36:52.96,>> Absolutely. Someone who's here to just
585,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"have the experience and not play the game, they're going to"
586,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,be playing the game. The game is happening with them
587,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,in it. And people who are here who are
588,00:37:02.79,00:37:02.79,"strategizing, they're also dealing with the personalities"
589,00:37:04.75,00:37:04.75,here and they're really in the experience.
590,00:37:06.71,00:37:06.71,And that's what makes it interesting is that none of us
591,00:37:08.58,00:37:08.58,are thinking about it exactly the same way.
592,00:37:10.29,00:37:10.29,"Otherwise, it would be pretty boring, I think."
593,00:37:12.08,00:37:12.08,">> PROBST: So Jessica, eight days in, is this game already"
594,00:37:14.38,00:37:14.38,more complicated than you anticipated?
595,00:37:17.38,00:37:17.38,>> I think that I'm just not used to the manipulation aspect
596,00:37:21.75,00:37:21.75,"of it, and just where people's intentions are gets really"
597,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,"confusing to me. Like, are you really telling me"
598,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,because you're being nice or are you telling me this because
599,00:37:30.42,00:37:30.42,"you're, like, trying to get me on your side so you could,"
600,00:37:32.58,00:37:32.58,"like, get me to, like, vote somebody off who I like, you"
601,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,"know? It's just weird, because I'm"
602,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,not ready to lose one of our members of our tribe yet.
603,00:37:41.08,00:37:41.08,">> PROBST: Ozzy, how is this tribe going to be different"
604,00:37:43.25,00:37:43.25,"after tonight's vote? >> Well, I'm going to..."
605,00:37:48.46,00:37:48.46,"after tonight's vote, I'm going to know where people actually"
606,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,stand as to what they were saying before.
607,00:37:53.67,00:37:53.67,So that's pretty much how it's going to go.
608,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,">> PROBST: Before we get to the vote, two of you have been to"
609,00:38:01.12,00:38:01.12,Exile Island. The hidden immunity idol might
610,00:38:03.62,00:38:03.62,"have been found. Just to be clear, here's how"
611,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,it works: if the person in possession of the idol receives
612,00:38:09.33,00:38:09.33,"the highest number of votes, you present that idol to me"
613,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,"after the vote, you're back in the game."
614,00:38:14.92,00:38:14.92,And the person with the next highest number of votes goes
615,00:38:17.25,00:38:17.25,home. It is time to vote.
616,00:38:19.29,00:38:19.29,"Yul, you're up. >> Cecilia, I'm really sorry to"
617,00:38:31.42,00:38:31.42,be sending you home. And the vote was either going to
618,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,"go against Becky or yourself. And between the two, my loyalty"
619,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,is to Becky. Best of luck to you.
620,00:38:44.46,00:38:44.46,>> It's nothing personal. I think you're amazing.
621,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,It's what I think will be better for the tribe.
622,00:38:57.54,00:38:57.54,">> It's nothing personal, girl. I'm just doing this as far as"
623,00:39:00.42,00:39:00.42,strategy for moving the tribe forward in this game.
624,00:39:08.17,00:39:08.17,">> You haven't made any effort to try and connect to me, get"
625,00:39:10.58,00:39:10.58,to know me at all. >> You're a very classy lady.
626,00:39:31.25,00:39:31.25,This is nothing personal. It's just strategy. 
627,00:39:54.21,00:39:54.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
628,00:40:06.58,00:40:06.58,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
629,00:40:08.79,00:40:08.79,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
630,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
631,00:40:15.88,00:40:15.88,"First vote, Cecilia. Becky."
632,00:40:22.17,00:40:22.17,One vote Cecilia; one vote Becky.
633,00:40:26.38,00:40:26.38,Two votes Becky; one vote Cecilia.
634,00:40:32.08,00:40:32.08,Cecilia. That's two votes Cecilia;
635,00:40:35.54,00:40:35.54,two votes Becky. Cecilia.
636,00:40:40.17,00:40:40.17,We're three votes Cecilia; two votes Becky.
637,00:40:46.21,00:40:46.21,Becky. We're tied.
638,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,Three votes Becky; three votes Cecilia.
639,00:40:55.21,00:40:55.21,Cecilia. Four votes Cecilia; three
640,00:40:58.25,00:40:58.25,votes Becky. One vote left.
641,00:41:08.17,00:41:08.17,Third person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands:
642,00:41:11.08,00:41:11.08,Cecilia. Please bring me your torch.
643,00:41:25.58,00:41:25.58,"Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. Well, one thing is clear, this"
644,00:41:41.58,00:41:41.58,tribe is definitely not unified. And only eight days in to a game
645,00:41:46.79,00:41:46.79,"this unpredictable, certainly risky."
646,00:41:49.79,00:41:49.79,Grab your torches. Go back to camp.
647,00:41:51.54,00:41:51.54,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for
648,00:42:06.50,00:42:06.50,scenes from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
649,00:42:11.21,00:42:11.21,"Survivor: At Raro, new lines are drawn."
650,00:42:15.58,00:42:15.58,>> The guys are just sitting and the girls are working.
651,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,That just doesn't fly with me at all.
652,00:42:20.29,00:42:20.29,">> PROBST: And at Aitu, Cao Boi goes too far."
653,00:42:23.29,00:42:23.29,">> Oh, my God, a little chick. Cao Boi is such a wild card."
654,00:42:27.12,00:42:27.12,I wouldn't trust him. I wouldn't trust him.

659,00:42:37.75,00:42:37.75,It's just a testament as to how quickly the game can change.
660,00:42:40.08,00:42:40.08,But I have no regrets. I had a great time.
661,00:42:42.12,00:42:42.12,It was an amazing eight days. I got to do crazy things that I
662,00:42:45.12,00:42:45.12,never thought I would ever do and probably won't ever do
663,00:42:47.88,00:42:47.88,again. I think that they made a mistake
664,00:42:49.83,00:42:49.83,voting me out. I don't think this is going to
665,00:42:51.79,00:42:51.79,"strengthen them. It may weaken the tribe,"
666,00:42:53.88,00:42:53.88,unfortunately.
