192,00:13:44.42,00:13:44.42,think.I just think that's a good
193,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,thing.>> The way our tribe is blended

227,00:15:28.38,00:15:28.38,I feel the vibration from otherpeople on my new tribe that I
228,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,didn't have the same in my oldtribe.

249,00:16:29.29,00:16:29.29,"I was like, ""We love you.""Like, our team, you know?"
250,00:16:31.83,00:16:31.83,I didn't mean it like that.>> He took it as you guys had a

270,00:17:44.29,00:17:44.29,"So I decided to work him, justfor starters."

285,00:19:06.83,00:19:06.83,>> I hear you.>> I knew Becky was the person
286,00:19:09.21,00:19:09.21,I had to get to first.But she was the key.
287,00:19:11.46,00:19:11.46,"She came right to me.She said, ""Yul and I would like"
288,00:19:14.25,00:19:14.25,"to get together with you andCandice."""

294,00:19:34.71,00:19:34.71,All right?But if anybody else approaches
295,00:19:37.29,00:19:37.29,"you, just say, ""Oh, yeah,whatever,"" or ""I'm not thinking"
296,00:19:39.62,00:19:39.62,"about it.""Just..."

300,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,But I'm thinking about it.Stay with me and Candice and
301,00:19:52.54,00:19:52.54,we'll take these other two andthe five of us will go to the

304,00:20:02.04,00:20:02.04,necessarily feel thatcomfortable because I didn't
305,00:20:04.62,00:20:04.62,feel that comfortable in thattribe to begin with.
306,00:20:07.25,00:20:07.25,>> We're strong.We'll go all the way.
307,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"I mean, seriously, we'll make itto the top five."
308,00:20:11.67,00:20:11.67,"It's going to be cool, allright?"
309,00:20:14.04,00:20:14.04,>> All right.I'm just kind of playing my
310,00:20:16.54,00:20:16.54,cards like I'm not reallythinking about alliances.
311,00:20:19.21,00:20:19.21,I'm just here to make friendsand see what happens and try
312,00:20:22.21,00:20:22.21,"to, you know, go as long as Ican without feeling fake."
313,00:20:28.88,00:20:28.88,">> Candice and I, we weretalking and so she... her and"

315,00:20:35.04,00:20:35.04,"you know, the perfect four.But then we were trying to"
316,00:20:37.92,00:20:37.92,"figure out our fifth person.So Jonathan mentioned Flicka,"
317,00:20:40.33,00:20:40.33,and then we were decidingbetween Ozzy and Cecilia.
318,00:20:43.75,00:20:43.75,So I don't know if her and Ozzyalready have an alliance or not
319,00:20:47.42,00:20:47.42,because they are two and they...>> I'm sure that right now
320,00:20:51.00,00:20:51.00,they're kind of expanding alittle bit because they
321,00:20:53.71,00:20:53.71,realize that they're cominginto this with fewer numbers.
322,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,"And so, I mean, if we went alongtribal lines, I mean, those"
323,00:20:58.08,00:20:58.08,people would be voted out alongwith Sundra.
324,00:21:01.04,00:21:01.04,"I've to tell you something.And again, you know, I'm"

339,00:21:38.62,00:21:38.62,advantage in this game to havesomebody that you can absolutely
340,00:21:41.17,00:21:41.17,"trust.And I think, given our"
341,00:21:43.25,00:21:43.25,"backgrounds and our commoninterests, I felt comfortable"
342,00:21:45.46,00:21:45.46,disclosing the information toher.
343,00:21:47.42,00:21:47.42,>> I am not going to tellanybody.

379,00:24:41.21,00:24:41.21,one more day here in the CookIslands.
380,00:24:44.17,00:24:44.17,"Losers, tribal council tonight,somebody going home."
381,00:24:48.25,00:24:48.25,There is one more element tothis challenge.
382,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,The details are in the note.It'll be revealed after the

384,00:24:55.75,00:24:55.75,">> Yeah.>> PROBST: Get suited up, we'll"
385,00:24:57.75,00:24:57.75,"go.Here we go, for immunity."
386,00:25:01.62,00:25:01.62,"Survivors, ready!Go!"
387,00:25:11.58,00:25:11.58,This is an endurance challenge.It is going to wear you out.
388,00:25:18.29,00:25:18.29,Water is almost knee-deep oneverybody.
389,00:25:21.88,00:25:21.88,Hard to walk through.Both tribes have big guys at
390,00:25:26.92,00:25:26.92,the end.Try to prevent easy tackles.
391,00:25:33.67,00:25:33.67,Both tribes have strong guys atthe front to make the tackles.
392,00:25:40.96,00:25:40.96,Aitu made up just a littleground on that round.
393,00:25:45.08,00:25:45.08,"Cecilia drops out, Sundra dropsout, Candice drops out, Becky"
394,00:25:50.50,00:25:50.50,dropping out.Aitu now down to five members.
395,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,Bold strategy move for Aitu.All of their men now with 30
396,00:25:57.46,00:25:57.46,pounds.Stephannie dropping out for
397,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,Raro.>> PROBST: Cristina dropping out

400,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,Jessica dropping out.She's giving her weight to

404,00:26:34.04,00:26:34.04,"Aitu is down to four guys--Ozzy, Jonathan, Cao Boi and Yul"
405,00:26:39.29,00:26:39.29,shouldering a lot of weight.Jonathan going to give 15
406,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,"pounds to Ozzy.Raro making up a lot of time,"
407,00:26:51.46,00:26:51.46,starting to close in on Aitu.Aitu has no options left.
408,00:26:56.83,00:26:56.83,Jonathan can hardly walk.Cao Boi needs to be helped by
409,00:27:00.83,00:27:00.83,"Yul.Rebecca finally dropping out, a"
410,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,key player in helping Raro geta lead.

412,00:27:13.29,00:27:13.29,"J.P., Nate, Brad, Adam closingthe gap with each step."
413,00:27:24.17,00:27:24.17,">> Give it all you got.Go, go!"
414,00:27:27.62,00:27:27.62,>> PROBST: Raro making a go ofit.
415,00:27:34.46,00:27:34.46,"J.P., Nate, Adam, Brad.Yul going to try to fight them"
416,00:27:39.58,00:27:39.58,off as long as he can.But Cao Boi's too weak.
417,00:27:44.25,00:27:44.25,This challenge is over!Raro wins immunity!
418,00:27:48.21,00:27:48.21,"( cheers )Raro, congratulations."
419,00:28:00.04,00:28:00.04,"( cheers and applause )Safe from the vote, guaranteed"
420,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,at least one more day out here.There is one more element to
421,00:28:07.96,00:28:07.96,this challenge.I'll read the note.
422,00:28:10.75,00:28:10.75,"""The winning tribe will chooseone member from the losing"

427,00:28:30.54,00:28:30.54,strategically.Figure out who it is going to
428,00:28:33.04,00:28:33.04,be.Do you have your decision?
429,00:28:35.92,00:28:35.92,>> Candice.>> PROBST: It was unanimous.
430,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"Candice, boat will pick you up,have your stuff for you."
431,00:28:43.08,00:28:43.08,"Head on out.Okay, Raro, you guys are safe"
432,00:28:48.67,00:28:48.67,from the vote.Everybody's good.
433,00:28:51.79,00:28:51.79,"Aitu, we have a date tonight attribal council."
434,00:28:54.17,00:28:54.17,One of the eight of you will begoing home.

437,00:29:24.46,00:29:24.46,>> Can we just take one secondand think of why they picked
438,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,Candice?>> I don't think they would

440,00:29:30.92,00:29:30.92,think they're just protectingher.
441,00:29:33.00,00:29:33.00,>> They're trying to protecther from us voting her off?
442,00:29:36.12,00:29:36.12,>> Candice went to Exile Island.It has a huge effect on our
443,00:29:39.08,00:29:39.08,"plans.Prior to this, we had an"
444,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,"alliance going on betweenmyself, Jonathan, Becky,"

447,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,advantage.But now it doesn't look to be
448,00:29:52.50,00:29:52.50,the case.And actually...
449,00:29:58.08,00:29:58.08,">> I need you guys, too.We all need each other."
450,00:30:00.08,00:30:00.08,We just need to win.>> But we have to obviously
451,00:30:02.75,00:30:02.75,write down some...>> We have to let Becky go.
452,00:30:05.62,00:30:05.62,>> Okay.>> I think Becky is the weak
453,00:30:07.96,00:30:07.96,link.>> All right.
454,00:30:13.25,00:30:13.25,">> Cao Boi said alliance withus, he said we're good, the"
455,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,"girls are good.He said he really liked you,"
456,00:30:20.21,00:30:20.21,"you know, everybody...We got all ( inaudible )."
457,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,I say we get rid of Becky.Becky is seriously plotting.
458,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,>> All we need is five.We are all voting for Becky.
459,00:30:32.79,00:30:32.79,"Cao Boi, myself, Cecilia,Sundra and Flicka seem to have"
460,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"some sort of an agreement, andwe'll see if it stands."
461,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,">> Jonathan, what are you doing?>> Let's..."
462,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,Come here.Let's...
463,00:30:59.25,00:30:59.25,I'll check in with you.>> No more talking.
464,00:31:05.50,00:31:05.50,We're done.>> I thought I had Flicka
465,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,handled.I thought she was with me.
466,00:31:31.88,00:31:31.88,"But she's not.She's doing her own thing, and"
467,00:31:34.08,00:31:34.08,I don't know how easy or hardit's going to be to convince
468,00:31:36.79,00:31:36.79,her otherwise.So we've got a serious problem
469,00:31:38.92,00:31:38.92,here.Where do we stand right now?
470,00:31:41.75,00:31:41.75,"It's you, me, Becky and that'sit."
471,00:31:44.33,00:31:44.33,We don't know where Sundra'sat.
472,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,We don't know where Cao Boi'sat.
473,00:31:47.50,00:31:47.50,And Flicka is going to beprobably impossible to switch.
474,00:31:49.83,00:31:49.83,">> Really?>> We're good, right, from what"
475,00:31:51.71,00:31:51.71,"we said.>> Yeah, yeah, we need to stick"
476,00:31:53.46,00:31:53.46,with it.But Jonathan is just worried
477,00:31:55.92,00:31:55.92,because I'm not for sure sayingthat I'm a part of their
478,00:31:59.12,00:31:59.12,alliance because I don't wantto be wishy washy.
479,00:32:01.25,00:32:01.25,>> You're just going to followyour gut.
480,00:32:03.75,00:32:03.75,>> We just have to make itthrough tonight. 
481,00:32:05.67,00:32:05.67,We've got to get Flicka or CaoBoi to vote for Cecilia.
482,00:32:07.92,00:32:07.92,And it's risky because if wedon't know that they are rock
483,00:32:10.38,00:32:10.38,"solid going to vote our way,then you and I put our necks way"
484,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,out on the line.Trying to convince Flicka and
485,00:32:19.38,00:32:19.38,Cao Boi to vote with us is thekey.
486,00:32:22.08,00:32:22.08,"If not, then all bets are offand it's going to be a whole"
487,00:32:25.96,00:32:25.96,different kettle of fish.All I'm concerned about is
488,00:32:28.83,00:32:28.83,making it to the merger.Everybody you like is going to
489,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,"get voted off.>> I know, it's not about that,"
490,00:32:35.42,00:32:35.42,though.It's about having trust in the
491,00:32:37.50,00:32:37.50,people that you have aconnection with.
492,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,">> Okay, so I thought you and Ihad a tight thing."
493,00:32:42.58,00:32:42.58,So we don't have such a tightthing.
494,00:32:44.38,00:32:44.38,Do we not trust each other?We're talking like adults.
495,00:32:46.38,00:32:46.38,>> I'm sorry.We have to let Becky go in
496,00:32:48.58,00:32:48.58,total fairness.She's the weak link.
497,00:32:50.33,00:32:50.33,Then we'll lose another one.>> She's not a weak link.
498,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,>> She is.She a princess out here.
499,00:32:54.08,00:32:54.08,You pay attention.She's a princess out here.
500,00:32:56.12,00:32:56.12,"I just watch and I just...>> But she's not... she's not,"
501,00:32:58.46,00:32:58.46,"like, weak.She's strong."
502,00:33:00.62,00:33:00.62,I think she has been verystrong and decisive on the
503,00:33:02.58,00:33:02.58,"challenges.I think if you look at Cecilia,"
504,00:33:05.00,00:33:05.00,"she hasn't been that strong.She's good at puzzles, but"
505,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,physically she hasn't been thatstrong.
506,00:33:09.50,00:33:09.50,">> If five of us vote forCecilia tonight, okay, and three"
507,00:33:12.88,00:33:12.88,"of you vote for Becky, then allof a sudden you're on the"
508,00:33:16.04,00:33:16.04,"outside and, boom, you're gone.>> If we get rid of Cecilia,"
509,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,"we'll have our numbers, okay?We can decide later on whether"
510,00:33:23.54,00:33:23.54,"we need to draw Becky, you,Jonathan, Flicka."
511,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,That's five.That's a solid five.
512,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33,">> That's still not the point,though."
513,00:33:32.58,00:33:32.58,">> Well, what is the point?I guess we're talking apples"
514,00:33:34.38,00:33:34.38,"and oranges.>> Yeah, we kind of are,"
515,00:33:36.17,00:33:36.17,because I'm just thinking she'sthe weaker link and I'm not
516,00:33:39.58,00:33:39.58,there.>> I'm trying to think ahead of
517,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,that.>> I'm not thinking ahead.
518,00:33:43.58,00:33:43.58,I'm not...>> But this is a game.
519,00:33:45.17,00:33:45.17,"This is like a chess game.>> Yeah, right."
520,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,>> This is a 30 day...we have 30 more days ahead of
521,00:33:49.38,00:33:49.38,us.You can't just think about
522,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,tomorrow.You have to put yourself in a
523,00:33:52.79,00:33:52.79,position that you can be therein 30 days.
524,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,You have to think about thatnow.
525,00:33:55.92,00:33:55.92,">> Uh-huh.>> I mean, because otherwise"
526,00:33:57.71,00:33:57.71,you won't be there.>> Uh-huh.
527,00:34:03.50,00:34:03.50,Hmm.I don't know.
528,00:34:05.75,00:34:05.75,I have to think about it still.>> We've got to stick tight.
529,00:34:09.75,00:34:09.75,">> You present your point and,okay, I'll listen to you."
530,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,>> I don't like the scheming ofman.
531,00:34:15.25,00:34:15.25,I really don't like that at all.I feel like I've always been
532,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,blessed.Maybe this time I'm wrong.
533,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,">> No matter what they said, Isaid, ""I'm going to talk to"
534,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,"Jessica first.""Okay."
535,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,>> I have a hard timetrusting...
536,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,>> I don't trust Jonathan.>> I don't trust Jonathan.
537,00:34:30.00,00:34:30.00,>> He's manipulative.>> I had a good talk with her.
538,00:34:33.92,00:34:33.92,She doesn't like the idea ofplaying the game that way.
539,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,">> But Jonathan has a point, thenumbers game."
540,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,We have to make it to themerger.
541,00:34:41.29,00:34:41.29,We can play the game some more.>> I don't want to be picked
542,00:34:43.33,00:34:43.33,"off.>> I know, but they are playing"
543,00:34:45.04,00:34:45.04,bad.You are not part of the crowd.
544,00:34:47.12,00:34:47.12,"I'm not part of the crowd,period."
545,00:34:48.71,00:34:48.71,We're just stuck in this...>> Now what do you do?
546,00:34:52.04,00:34:52.04,I don't know what to do.I'm getting all wrapped up in
547,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,"this whole drama.I realize it's a numbers game,"
548,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,"but I have a lot of respect forCeci, so I don't know."
549,00:35:01.79,00:35:01.79,"It's so hard.I'm like, ahh!"
550,00:35:08.67,00:35:08.67,">> Two ways to play the game:""I like you, so I'm not going"

555,00:35:22.33,00:35:22.33,been.>> PROBST: Go ahead and have a
556,00:35:38.79,00:35:38.79,seat.So let's talk about the merge.
557,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,"Jonathan, in this case, thetribes have been divided based"
558,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,on ethnicity.Did that add anything to the
559,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,merge?>> I didn't think so.
560,00:35:52.38,00:35:52.38,"Honestly, I didn't.I think the captains selected"
561,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,the strongest people they couldgiven the parameters.
562,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,We had a sense of who wasstrong and I'm actually really
563,00:35:59.88,00:35:59.88,pleased with the way the mergewent.
564,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,">> PROBST: Sundra, as the onlyperson from one tribe, you"
565,00:36:04.67,00:36:04.67,suddenly can become extremelypowerful as everybody now wants
566,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,your vote because you have noallegiance to anyone.
567,00:36:11.38,00:36:11.38,">> Yeah, I mean, you could sayyou are either vulnerable or"
568,00:36:14.12,00:36:14.12,"valuable, and I don't givecredit to either."
569,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,"I just try to be there andjust use my gut to say, ""Okay,"
570,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,"this is what I should do,""because, as you know, there's"
571,00:36:22.42,00:36:22.42,no way to guarantee the resultsof playing this game.
572,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,">> PROBST: Yul, assess thistribe."
573,00:36:28.29,00:36:28.29,What do you think would be thebest direction for this tribe
574,00:36:30.54,00:36:30.54,to head?>> My sense is that some people
575,00:36:33.12,00:36:33.12,have different priorities interms of what they are looking
576,00:36:35.54,00:36:35.54,for out of being here.I think some people are
577,00:36:38.04,00:36:38.04,strategizing and trying to makealliances and came here to play
578,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,"hard to win the game.I think other people came here,"
579,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,"you know, hoping that thisis going to be a personally"
580,00:36:45.71,00:36:45.71,fulfilling experience foreveryone.
581,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,">> PROBST: And Jonathan,nothing wrong or right about"
582,00:36:50.58,00:36:50.58,either one of those ends of thecontinuum.
583,00:36:52.96,00:36:52.96,>> Absolutely.Someone who's here to just
584,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"have the experience and notplay the game, they're going to"
585,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,be playing the game.The game is happening with them
586,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,in it.And people who are here who are
587,00:37:02.79,00:37:02.79,"strategizing, they're alsodealing with the personalities"
588,00:37:04.75,00:37:04.75,here and they're really in theexperience.
589,00:37:06.71,00:37:06.71,And that's what makes itinteresting is that none of us
590,00:37:08.58,00:37:08.58,are thinking about it exactlythe same way.
591,00:37:10.29,00:37:10.29,"Otherwise, it would be prettyboring, I think."
592,00:37:12.08,00:37:12.08,">> PROBST: So Jessica, eightdays in, is this game already"
593,00:37:14.38,00:37:14.38,more complicated than youanticipated?
594,00:37:17.38,00:37:17.38,>> I think that I'm just notused to the manipulation aspect
595,00:37:21.75,00:37:21.75,"of it, and just where people'sintentions are gets really"
596,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,"confusing to me.Like, are you really telling me"
597,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,because you're being nice orare you telling me this because
598,00:37:30.42,00:37:30.42,"you're, like, trying to get meon your side so you could,"
599,00:37:32.58,00:37:32.58,"like, get me to, like, votesomebody off who I like, you"
600,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,"know?It's just weird, because I'm"
601,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,not ready to lose one of ourmembers of our tribe yet.
602,00:37:41.08,00:37:41.08,">> PROBST: Ozzy, how is thistribe going to be different"
603,00:37:43.25,00:37:43.25,"after tonight's vote?>> Well, I'm going to..."
604,00:37:48.46,00:37:48.46,"after tonight's vote, I'm goingto know where people actually"
605,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,stand as to what they weresaying before.
606,00:37:53.67,00:37:53.67,So that's pretty much how it'sgoing to go.
607,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,">> PROBST: Before we get to thevote, two of you have been to"
608,00:38:01.12,00:38:01.12,Exile Island.The hidden immunity idol might
609,00:38:03.62,00:38:03.62,"have been found.Just to be clear, here's how"
610,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,it works: if the person inpossession of the idol receives
611,00:38:09.33,00:38:09.33,"the highest number of votes,you present that idol to me"
612,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,"after the vote, you're back inthe game."
613,00:38:14.92,00:38:14.92,And the person with the nexthighest number of votes goes
614,00:38:17.25,00:38:17.25,home.It is time to vote.
615,00:38:19.29,00:38:19.29,"Yul, you're up.>> Cecilia, I'm really sorry to"
616,00:38:31.42,00:38:31.42,be sending you home.And the vote was either going to
617,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,"go against Becky or yourself.And between the two, my loyalty"
618,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,is to Becky.Best of luck to you.
619,00:38:44.46,00:38:44.46,>> It's nothing personal.I think you're amazing.
620,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,It's what I think will bebetter for the tribe.
621,00:38:57.54,00:38:57.54,">> It's nothing personal, girl.I'm just doing this as far as"
622,00:39:00.42,00:39:00.42,strategy for moving the tribeforward in this game.
623,00:39:08.17,00:39:08.17,">> You haven't made any effortto try and connect to me, get"
624,00:39:10.58,00:39:10.58,to know me at all.>> You're a very classy lady.
625,00:39:31.25,00:39:31.25,This is nothing personal.It's just strategy. 
626,00:39:54.21,00:39:54.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
627,00:40:06.58,00:40:06.58,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
628,00:40:08.79,00:40:08.79,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
629,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
630,00:40:15.88,00:40:15.88,"First vote, Cecilia.Becky."
631,00:40:22.17,00:40:22.17,One vote Cecilia; one voteBecky.
632,00:40:26.38,00:40:26.38,Two votes Becky; one voteCecilia.
633,00:40:32.08,00:40:32.08,Cecilia.That's two votes Cecilia;
634,00:40:35.54,00:40:35.54,two votes Becky.Cecilia.
635,00:40:40.17,00:40:40.17,We're three votes Cecilia; twovotes Becky.
636,00:40:46.21,00:40:46.21,Becky.We're tied.
637,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,Three votes Becky; threevotes Cecilia.
638,00:40:55.21,00:40:55.21,Cecilia.Four votes Cecilia; three
639,00:40:58.25,00:40:58.25,votes Becky.One vote left.
640,00:41:08.17,00:41:08.17,Third person voted out ofSurvivor: Cook Islands:
641,00:41:11.08,00:41:11.08,Cecilia.Please bring me your torch.
642,00:41:25.58,00:41:25.58,"Cecilia, the tribe has spoken.Well, one thing is clear, this"
643,00:41:41.58,00:41:41.58,tribe is definitely not unified.And only eight days in to a game
644,00:41:46.79,00:41:46.79,"this unpredictable, certainlyrisky."
645,00:41:49.79,00:41:49.79,Grab your torches.Go back to camp.
646,00:41:51.54,00:41:51.54,Good night.>> PROBST: Stay tuned for
647,00:42:06.50,00:42:06.50,scenes from our next episode.>> PROBST: Next time on
648,00:42:11.21,00:42:11.21,"Survivor: At Raro, new linesare drawn."
649,00:42:15.58,00:42:15.58,>> The guys are just sittingand the girls are working.
650,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17,That just doesn't fly with meat all.
651,00:42:20.29,00:42:20.29,">> PROBST: And at Aitu, Cao Boigoes too far."
652,00:42:23.29,00:42:23.29,">> Oh, my God, a little chick.Cao Boi is such a wild card."
653,00:42:27.12,00:42:27.12,I wouldn't trust him.I wouldn't trust him.

658,00:42:37.75,00:42:37.75,It's just a testament as tohow quickly the game can change.
659,00:42:40.08,00:42:40.08,But I have no regrets.I had a great time.
660,00:42:42.12,00:42:42.12,It was an amazing eight days.I got to do crazy things that I
661,00:42:45.12,00:42:45.12,never thought I would ever doand probably won't ever do
662,00:42:47.88,00:42:47.88,again.I think that they made a mistake
663,00:42:49.83,00:42:49.83,voting me out.I don't think this is going to
664,00:42:51.79,00:42:51.79,"strengthen them.It may weaken the tribe,"
665,00:42:53.88,00:42:53.88,unfortunately.
