2,00:00:03.83,00:00:03.83,Survivor: Drop your buffs.
3,00:00:06.25,00:00:06.25,It is now time to integrate. The four-tribe ethnic
4,00:00:09.25,00:00:09.25,division... You are the new Aitu tribe.
5,00:00:11.71,00:00:11.71,You are the new Raro tribe. ...dissolved into a melting
6,00:00:15.29,00:00:15.29,"pot. Two new tribes, a whole new"
7,00:00:17.25,00:00:17.25,game. At the new Raro tribe...
8,00:00:22.25,00:00:22.25,>> There are so many men on this tribe now.
9,00:00:24.25,00:00:24.25,"Seems like we got all the, like, really big, buff guys."
10,00:00:26.71,00:00:26.71,"Your pants are falling off, Nate."
11,00:00:29.62,00:00:29.62,I'm absolutely going to flirt with him.
12,00:00:31.58,00:00:31.58,It's what I do best. >> PROBST: At the new Aitu...
13,00:00:34.42,00:00:34.42,">> I trust Yul, I trust Candice."
14,00:00:36.38,00:00:36.38,>> I totally agree. >> PROBST: ...new plans were
15,00:00:38.12,00:00:38.12,laid. >> Becky came right to me.
16,00:00:39.83,00:00:39.83,"She said, "" Yul and I would like to get together with you"
17,00:00:41.88,00:00:41.88,"and Candice."" I said, ""I believe that I have"
18,00:00:43.42,00:00:43.42,"Flicka."" Stay with me and Candice and"
19,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,we'll take these other two and the five of us will go to the
20,00:00:47.54,00:00:47.54,merge. >> PROBST: And Yul solidified
21,00:00:49.38,00:00:49.38,his bond with Becky. >> I found the idol.
22,00:00:51.46,00:00:51.46,>> It's so awesome. >> It's a huge advantage to
23,00:00:53.62,00:00:53.62,have someone that you absolutely trust.
24,00:00:55.88,00:00:55.88,">> Oh, I'm so excited! >> Give it all you got, go!"
25,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,>> PROBST: During the immunity challenge...
26,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,Yul going try to fight them off as long as he can.
27,00:01:03.67,00:01:03.67,...Aitu was outmatched by the brawn of the new Raro tribe.
28,00:01:07.00,00:01:07.00,Raro wins immunity. Raro sent Candice to Exile
29,00:01:11.12,00:01:11.12,"Island, saving her from tribal council and jeopardizing the"
30,00:01:15.38,00:01:15.38,Aitu alliance. >> PROBST: Suddenly Becky was on
31,00:01:21.25,00:01:21.25,the chopping block. >> Jonathan...
32,00:01:27.54,00:01:27.54,">> I thought Flicka was me, so we've got a serious problem"
33,00:01:30.21,00:01:30.21,here. >> We have to let Becky go.
34,00:01:32.38,00:01:32.38,"She's a princess out here. >> She's not, like, weak, she's"
35,00:01:34.58,00:01:34.58,strong. >> PROBST: Yul and Jonathan
36,00:01:36.75,00:01:36.75,scrambled to save Becky. >> If five of us vote for
37,00:01:39.04,00:01:39.04,"Cecilia and three of you vote for Becky, then all of a sudden"
38,00:01:42.12,00:01:42.12,you're on the outside. Trying to convince Flicka and
39,00:01:45.25,00:01:45.25,Cao Boi to vote with us is the key.
40,00:01:48.00,00:01:48.00,"If not, then, all bets are off and it's going to be a whole"
41,00:01:51.92,00:01:51.92,different kettle of fish. >> PROBST: At tribal council it
42,00:01:55.67,00:01:55.67,"came down to Becky or Cecilia. In the end, it was Ozzy's"
43,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,former tribemate who was voted out.
44,00:02:01.67,00:02:01.67,"Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. 17 are left."
45,00:02:05.62,00:02:05.62,Who will be voted out tonight? >> At tribal council tonight it
46,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,came very close. I received three votes and
47,00:02:44.25,00:02:44.25,Cecilia received five. The alliance that I feel pretty
48,00:02:47.25,00:02:47.25,"comfortable with and pretty confident is Yul for sure,"
49,00:02:51.00,00:02:51.00,"Candice is right now on Exile Island, she's still in the"
50,00:02:54.04,00:02:54.04,"alliance, and Jonathan said that he would stay in the"
51,00:02:56.17,00:02:56.17,"alliance, too. >> No, no."
52,00:03:02.08,00:03:02.08,>> Coconut. >> I don't like hermit crabs.
53,00:03:04.42,00:03:04.42,I feel like I'm on the outside. To lose the only member of my
54,00:03:06.29,00:03:06.29,"former tribe, the person that helped me lay the foundations"
55,00:03:09.88,00:03:09.88,of everything that these people are going to enjoy makes me
56,00:03:12.25,00:03:12.25,feel like crap. If they want to vote me out
57,00:03:20.75,00:03:20.75,they should do it soon so I don't have to keep catching
58,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,food for them. I just don't feel like playing
59,00:03:25.17,00:03:25.17,along any more. (theme song playing)

61,00:03:36.58,00:03:36.58, TELEVISION >> Is that Candice?
62,00:04:52.08,00:04:52.08,>> Candice. Look at her waving like Miss
63,00:04:54.04,00:04:54.04,America. (laughter)
64,00:04:56.04,00:04:56.04,">> Candice! >> Hey, guys."
65,00:04:58.42,00:04:58.42,>> How was it? >> No idol.
66,00:05:01.00,00:05:01.00,">> Oh, man. >> I think probably because I'm"
67,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,"the youngest, or whatever. >> You think they did it, like,"
68,00:05:12.25,00:05:12.25,"as a bad thing? >> I don't know, you guys are"
69,00:05:23.04,00:05:23.04,asking good questions because I haven't even thought about any
70,00:05:25.38,00:05:25.38,of this. I didn't have time.
71,00:05:27.46,00:05:27.46,I think probably Adam and Parvati told their tribe to
72,00:05:30.21,00:05:30.21,send me to exile. But I don't want the rest of
73,00:05:33.08,00:05:33.08,"the team to think that I have some special, you know, get out"
74,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,of jail free card from the other team.
75,00:05:39.04,00:05:39.04,"And everybody's like, ""Yeah, what do you think, what do you"
76,00:05:41.08,00:05:41.08,"think?"" And I said, ""Well, I don't"
77,00:05:42.62,00:05:42.62,"know, I hadn't thought about that."""
78,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,"You know, just played dumb. >> Oh, I didn't even think"
79,00:05:50.12,00:05:50.12,about that. My mind is...
80,00:06:08.25,00:06:08.25,>> Feels soft already. (laughter)
81,00:06:16.67,00:06:16.67,>> Like Sunday night football. >> I know.
82,00:06:20.42,00:06:20.42,It was kind of annoying that the guys were just sitting and
83,00:06:23.50,00:06:23.50,just waiting there and drinking all the coconuts they could
84,00:06:26.25,00:06:26.25,"drink and the girls were, you know, working on improving our"
85,00:06:29.08,00:06:29.08,shelter. They're starting to rule the
86,00:06:31.71,00:06:31.71,roost a little bit. I think they're getting very
87,00:06:34.92,00:06:34.92,comfortable with their position in this tribe.
88,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,"Because they know that we need them, they're strong."
89,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,>> No. >> No way.
90,00:06:47.38,00:06:47.38,>> You think they were? >> I don't know.
91,00:06:49.96,00:06:49.96,">> Even if they all do think, what's that going to do to us?"
92,00:06:54.12,00:06:54.12,"Nothing. You know, we're all fired up on"
93,00:06:57.79,00:06:57.79,how dominant and strong we are as a tribe right now.
94,00:07:00.71,00:07:00.71,"As a group of guys we're way, way stronger than the other"
95,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,tribe's group of guys. And I think the testosterone's
96,00:07:08.29,00:07:08.29,flying a little bit and the guys want to stick together.
97,00:07:11.17,00:07:11.17,These girls are going to need manpower for sure.
98,00:07:13.75,00:07:13.75,So the four guy alliance is definitely relaxed.
99,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Raro, getting your first look"
100,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,at the new Aitu tribe. Cecilia voted out at the last
101,00:07:34.92,00:07:34.92,"tribal council. All right, today's challenge is"
102,00:07:44.58,00:07:44.58,for reward. Each tribe will select two
103,00:07:48.12,00:07:48.12,tribe members to be attached by belt to a very long rope that
104,00:07:52.08,00:07:52.08,"snakes over, under and around a series of obstacles."
105,00:07:56.58,00:07:56.58,The rest of the tribe will push and pull those two tribe
106,00:08:00.12,00:08:00.12,members through all of the obstacles.
107,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,At the end of the rope is a decoder table.
108,00:08:05.17,00:08:05.17,"Once the entire tribe reaches the table, one tribe member will"
109,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,"swim out to a barrel, dive down, unclip a decoding wheel."
110,00:08:12.79,00:08:12.79,Bring it back to shore and the entire tribe will use that
111,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,decoding wheel to decipher one phrase.
112,00:08:19.08,00:08:19.08,First tribe to correctly decipher the phrase wins reward.
113,00:08:22.83,00:08:22.83,Want to know what you're playing for?
114,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Warmth and comfort.
115,00:08:27.04,00:08:27.04,"Three blankets, two pillows, one hammock."
116,00:08:32.12,00:08:32.12,"In addition, the winning tribe will choose one person from the"
117,00:08:35.21,00:08:35.21,losing tribe to go to Exile Island.
118,00:08:38.00,00:08:38.00,They will stay there until the next immunity challenge.
119,00:08:40.92,00:08:40.92,"Raro, you have one extra member. Who's sitting this challenge"
120,00:08:43.79,00:08:43.79,out? >> I am.
121,00:08:45.67,00:08:45.67,">> PROBST: Stephannie. All right, we will get you"
122,00:08:47.25,00:08:47.25,belted up and we'll get going. Attached to the belt for Aitu
123,00:08:51.42,00:08:51.42,"it is Becky and Candice. For Raro, Jenny and"
124,00:08:54.79,00:08:54.79,"Cristina. Here we go, for reward,"
125,00:08:57.04,00:08:57.04,survivors ready. Go.
126,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,Both tribes working the rope. Teamwork critical in this.
127,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,">> Go Raro, looking good. >> I got slack, I got slack."
128,00:09:10.58,00:09:10.58,>> PROBST: Easy to get confused in this maze of rope.
129,00:09:14.46,00:09:14.46,">> Good job, good job. >> Go under."
130,00:09:16.83,00:09:16.83,>> And under. >> Go through the hole.
131,00:09:19.00,00:09:19.00,">> Go, go, go. >> PROBST: Aitu with a bit of a"
132,00:09:21.08,00:09:21.08,lead. >> Dig. Dig it.
133,00:09:24.88,00:09:24.88,">> Hole, hole. >> PROBST: Raro moving on to the"
134,00:09:28.25,00:09:28.25,log dig. All the guys working hard to
135,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,dig out that sand. Yul pulls Becky feet first
136,00:09:37.67,00:09:37.67,through. She's stuck under the log.
137,00:09:41.38,00:09:41.38,">> Pull, pull, pull, doesn't matter, pull."
138,00:09:44.29,00:09:44.29,>> PROBST: Got a face full of sand.
139,00:09:47.00,00:09:47.00,Jenny goes head first for Raro. >> Pull her out.
140,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,">> Pull her! >> Her foot, her foot."
141,00:09:54.25,00:09:54.25,">> Don't worry about her. Becky, you worry about your job."
142,00:09:57.21,00:09:57.21,">> We're doing great, now go. >> PROBST: Aitu on to the next"
143,00:09:59.50,00:09:59.50,obstacle. Raro's through the log.
144,00:10:02.21,00:10:02.21,"We are neck and neck. >> Come on, baby!"

148,00:10:17.46,00:10:17.46,We will give her a pillow tonight.
149,00:10:21.54,00:10:21.54,">> PROBST: Aitu moving on to the next obstacle, still with a bit"
150,00:10:24.21,00:10:24.21,of a lead over Raro. Raro now moving on to the next
151,00:10:28.21,00:10:28.21,obstacle. Still a tight race.
152,00:10:32.08,00:10:32.08,">> Hold the rope, go up here, go up here, Jenny."
153,00:10:35.04,00:10:35.04,"Come up, come up, come up. >> PROBST: Both tribes are neck"

209,00:14:24.17,00:14:24.17,>> Woo-hoo! >> I definitely like winning
210,00:14:28.21,00:14:28.21,the last challenge because all of us feel a little threatened
211,00:14:31.12,00:14:31.12,"by the brawn on the other team because they're so beefy, you"
212,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,know? >> This is amazing.
213,00:14:36.12,00:14:36.12,>> We came together when it counted.
214,00:14:56.12,00:14:56.12,>> He's the fishing star for sure.
215,00:14:58.17,00:14:58.17,Ozzy is a mad fisherman. Caught eight fish or something
216,00:15:01.67,00:15:01.67,and he's out there for more. Fantastic.
217,00:15:09.54,00:15:09.54,">> Oh, my God. >> Nice job, man."

224,00:15:36.88,00:15:36.88,I feel that I have the most power.
225,00:15:39.08,00:15:39.08,If they lose me then they're going to be losing a lot of
226,00:15:41.92,00:15:41.92,strength. >> I think we should call him
227,00:15:44.00,00:15:44.00,"Poseidon now or something. >> Yes, King Neptune."
228,00:15:47.00,00:15:47.00,">> Because he's the god of the sea, right?"
229,00:15:48.88,00:15:48.88,"(laughter) >> Yeah, that was just so"
230,00:15:56.96,00:15:56.96,"frustrating. >> Well, you guys, there's a"
231,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,"bright side to this. We need to be humbled, (a)."
232,00:16:01.83,00:16:01.83,"We got humbled. So, hey, no one is going home."
233,00:16:09.00,00:16:09.00,>> We were just bummed out that we lost.
234,00:16:11.00,00:16:11.00,We took a lot of pride in winning.
235,00:16:12.83,00:16:12.83,And then also bummed that Adam got sent to Exile Island.
236,00:16:18.04,00:16:18.04,"Well, let's cook because nightfall's going to be here in"
237,00:16:20.58,00:16:20.58,"probably less than an hour. >> Wait, they have to go on"
238,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,rocks. They can't go on wet. 
239,00:16:46.54,00:16:46.54,">> J.P. is very demanding, and I think he does it in a very sly"
240,00:16:50.75,00:16:50.75,"way where if you're not very observant, you wouldn't even"
241,00:16:53.92,00:16:53.92,realize that he's being controlling.
242,00:16:55.96,00:16:55.96,But just the way he was sitting in camp today like all sprawled
243,00:16:58.54,00:16:58.54,out with his back against the like recliner on the throne and
244,00:17:01.96,00:17:01.96,everybody's just like waiting on him.
245,00:17:04.42,00:17:04.42,">> Parvati, can you give me the machete?"
246,00:17:06.29,00:17:06.29,>> Where is it? He's very demanding.
247,00:17:09.42,00:17:09.42,"He's like, ""Oh, hand me that machete, hand me this bowl."""
248,00:17:12.12,00:17:12.12,"You know, ""Serve me."" I'm like no, that just doesn't"
249,00:17:15.25,00:17:15.25,fly with me at all. >> Yesterday I was cutting a
250,00:17:31.21,00:17:31.21,"coconut and they're like, ""Nate, come over here."""
251,00:17:33.58,00:17:33.58,"I was like, ""What?"" Ow."
252,00:17:36.62,00:17:36.62,"Oh, it's a crab. (laughter)"
253,00:17:40.83,00:17:40.83,"I'm like damn, this nut hurts. >> That's how I can get close"
254,00:17:46.29,00:17:46.29,to guys in the beginning is just flirting with them.
255,00:17:49.12,00:17:49.12,"I mean, you just have to figure out the best way to infiltrate"
256,00:17:52.71,00:17:52.71,the little groups. >> Really?
257,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,">> Yeah, guys are tight. But, you know, we're tight."
258,00:18:03.25,00:18:03.25,You know that. You know that.
259,00:18:09.46,00:18:09.46,You don't believe me? >> I believe you.
260,00:18:11.42,00:18:11.42,>> I know you believe me. My feelings for Parvati are
261,00:18:13.62,00:18:13.62,that she's a very cool girl. We click real good.
262,00:18:17.25,00:18:17.25,"She's smart, but I can definitely trust her."
263,00:18:19.75,00:18:19.75,She's definitely like... she's my ace right now.
264,00:18:25.08,00:18:25.08,I think there definitely could be some sparks in the future.
265,00:18:28.42,00:18:28.42,But I don't want to find myself thinking like a dumb-dumb and
266,00:18:32.04,00:18:32.04,"just... you know, just guys sometimes, we can't control"
267,00:18:36.12,00:18:36.12,ourselves. They trust me.
268,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,">> By the guys, you mean J.P.? He's the one who's calling"
269,00:18:42.08,00:18:42.08,"shots, he's the one who's making the decisions."
270,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,">> Well, he is because he knows he has me and he knows he has"
271,00:18:46.58,00:18:46.58,"the other guys. >> I just don't like that he is,"
272,00:18:48.79,00:18:48.79,"like, completely in control right now."
273,00:18:50.75,00:18:50.75,Or thinks he is. >> But that's how you let the
274,00:18:54.12,00:18:54.12,game play-- let the king think he's all good and sitting
275,00:18:56.62,00:18:56.62,pretty. >> Is that your new motto?
276,00:19:02.92,00:19:02.92,>> I do not want to upset J.P. right now.
277,00:19:05.92,00:19:05.92,That would be the last person I would want on my bad side.
278,00:19:08.58,00:19:08.58,So I'm just going to let the king sit pretty until something
279,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,"happens. >> Sitting in the nest, she's"
280,00:19:48.42,00:19:48.42,"probably got eggs. >> Yeah, they got eggs."
281,00:19:51.79,00:19:51.79,>> Let's go look at them. >> I don't know if she's
282,00:19:53.88,00:19:53.88,protecting eggs or she just is tough.
283,00:19:55.38,00:19:55.38,>> I think she's got eggs. The kid in me want to get some
284,00:20:00.17,00:20:00.17,eggs for everybody. I don't need it but the kid in
285,00:20:03.08,00:20:03.08,me want to climb the tree. The kid in me want to get up
286,00:20:06.83,00:20:06.83,there and see if I can do it. Give me a stick.
287,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,">> No eggs. >> Oh, my God."
288,00:20:25.67,00:20:25.67,>> What? >> Oh.
289,00:20:29.46,00:20:29.46,"Oh, wow! >> The little chick."
290,00:20:33.12,00:20:33.12,">> Fell out? >> Oh, man."
291,00:20:38.25,00:20:38.25,Just one? >> Yeah.
292,00:20:41.42,00:20:41.42,>> Put it back in the nest. >> Thing can't fly.
293,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,">> Oh, man. Can't put the nest back, you"
294,00:20:49.50,00:20:49.50,want to put the nest back? >> No.
295,00:20:52.46,00:20:52.46,">> It wouldn't work, would it? >> This thing is newborn, like"
296,00:20:55.21,00:20:55.21,today. Just covered with its... with
297,00:20:59.21,00:20:59.21,"its stuff. I mean, it couldn't hold its"
298,00:21:02.33,00:21:02.33,head up. It had been born within 24
299,00:21:04.25,00:21:04.25,hours. And it's in my hand.
300,00:21:07.38,00:21:07.38,"I mean, I wanted to cry. I felt terrible."
301,00:21:10.17,00:21:10.17,I don't know. >> We can't put the nest back
302,00:21:13.50,00:21:13.50,up. >> We can try.
303,00:21:16.21,00:21:16.21,">> Okay, I'm going to put it back for you."
304,00:21:18.42,00:21:18.42,"Sorry. I am really sorry, I mean it."
305,00:21:21.17,00:21:21.17,"Curiosity got the best of me, birdie."
306,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,>> The nest is really fragile. >> Grab the tree branch.
307,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,">> We're sorry, mother. >> Can you just put it on that"
308,00:21:31.33,00:21:31.33,"branch? >> Yeah, that's where it was."
309,00:21:35.12,00:21:35.12,>> He's okay. He's okay.
310,00:21:39.38,00:21:39.38,"Forgive us, please. >> Forgive us."
311,00:21:41.33,00:21:41.33,"I'm sorry. There, secure, okay."
312,00:21:44.62,00:21:44.62,>> Nice. >> Good job.
313,00:21:46.96,00:21:46.96,>> I'm sorry. That kid in me just keep wanting
314,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,"to do this and do that, without thinking."
315,00:21:53.21,00:21:53.21,And getting in trouble. I should know better.
316,00:21:55.04,00:21:55.04,Why am I doing the stupid things for?
317,00:21:58.04,00:21:58.04,I feel really bad. I'm really humbled.
318,00:22:06.46,00:22:06.46,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Adam,"
319,00:22:21.04,00:22:21.04,returning from Exile Island. (applause)
320,00:22:25.25,00:22:25.25,">> Welcome home. >> Welcome home, brother."
321,00:22:29.50,00:22:29.50,"Good to see you. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"

326,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,will race to assemble a stretch of puzzle.
327,00:22:48.88,00:22:48.88,You will then run through the jungle with the stretcher until
328,00:22:52.00,00:22:52.00,"you reach the beach, where you will find another tribe member"
329,00:22:55.17,00:22:55.17,shackled at the top of a mast. One tribe member will make the

331,00:23:03.88,00:23:03.88,member. Both will then swim back to the
332,00:23:06.29,00:23:06.29,beach holding on to a life ring. You will place the rescued
333,00:23:10.21,00:23:10.21,"tribemate on the stretcher, run back to the start where the"
334,00:23:13.96,00:23:13.96,three remaining tribe members must now build a rescue fire.

339,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,"Rarotonga, you have one extra member, sitting somebody out."
340,00:23:35.42,00:23:35.42,Cannot sit out the same person out in back-to-back challenges.
341,00:23:38.04,00:23:38.04,Stephannie sat out last time. Who's it going to be today?

378,00:26:03.25,00:26:03.25,J.P. and Parvati falling behind. Losing time for Raro.
379,00:26:07.75,00:26:07.75,>> Lie down. >> PROBST: Aitu heading back to
380,00:26:11.29,00:26:11.29,the start to build fire. >> Come on you guys.
381,00:26:15.25,00:26:15.25,>> PROBST: Raro's catching up. Once you hit the mat you can
382,00:26:19.92,00:26:19.92,"start on the fire. >> Go, go."
383,00:26:23.38,00:26:23.38,">> Let's go, guys. >> PROBST: Raro back."
384,00:26:31.04,00:26:31.04,">> Go! >> PROBST: Stephannie, Jenny,"
385,00:26:33.29,00:26:33.29,Becca start on their fire. Both Aitu and Raro working on
386,00:26:40.25,00:26:40.25,the magnesium. >> Get the flint going.
387,00:26:45.21,00:26:45.21,>> PROBST: Cao Boi flame for Aitu.
388,00:26:47.96,00:26:47.96,">> I'm going to burn that. >> Come on, baby, you're the"
389,00:26:51.58,00:26:51.58,man. >> PROBST: Aitu with a lot
390,00:26:55.33,00:26:55.33,of smoke. Do they still have flame?
391,00:26:59.21,00:26:59.21,Cao Boi got his own system. >> Yee-ha.
392,00:27:05.25,00:27:05.25,">> Don't lose it, stay cool. >> PROBST: Cao Boi's either"
393,00:27:08.50,00:27:08.50,going to be a hero or very silly.
394,00:27:11.08,00:27:11.08,Raro not giving up. You're still in this.
395,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,Somebody got whacked. Jenny with a bloody hand.
396,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,">> Come on, baby. >> PROBST: Whatever Cao Boi was"
397,00:27:25.33,00:27:25.33,"doing, it's working. Stephannie trying to get"
398,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,something going for Raro. >> Come on.
399,00:27:32.54,00:27:32.54,>> PROBST: Cao Boi with a big flame now for Aitu.
400,00:27:34.92,00:27:34.92,Can they keep it going? Raro needs to get fire quickly.
401,00:27:38.46,00:27:38.46,What you're doing isn't working.
402,00:27:40.50,00:27:40.50,>> You guys want to switch off? >> PROBST: Fire is going for
403,00:27:43.04,00:27:43.04,Aitu. Raro has nothing.
404,00:27:47.92,00:27:47.92,Immunity on the line. Tribal council for the losers.
405,00:27:51.96,00:27:51.96,>> It's up to the rope. >> PROBST: That flame is burning
406,00:27:53.88,00:27:53.88,"the rope. >> Yeah, yeah."
407,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,>> PROBST: Becca not giving up. >> You guys are awesome.
408,00:28:00.42,00:28:00.42,Here it comes. Watch the flag.

410,00:28:17.25,00:28:17.25,"Aitu, congratulations. Once again you worked well"
411,00:28:20.21,00:28:20.21,together and it paid off-- immunity.
412,00:28:22.71,00:28:22.71,"(cheers) Raro, not good news for you"
413,00:28:26.88,00:28:26.88,guys. Tribal council tonight.
414,00:28:28.67,00:28:28.67,Somebody from this tribe is going home.
415,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,Head on out. See you at tribal.
416,00:29:03.83,00:29:03.83,">> Well, unfortunately since we lost our challenge today that"
417,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,means we're going to tribal council tonight.
418,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50,And no one's looking forward to that.
419,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,But it has to be. Someone has to go home tonight.
420,00:29:17.12,00:29:17.12,">> Keep our heads up, guys. I don't want to see any frowns."
421,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,>> Too bad we went up against a Zen fire master.
422,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,>> I feel like I'm the weakest link and I'm so angry with
423,00:29:33.12,00:29:33.12,myself about that. Like I should have done better.
424,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,"I should have struck the flint harder, stronger, done"
425,00:29:38.92,00:29:38.92,"something, you know, to make more of a difference."
426,00:29:42.54,00:29:42.54,">> Just so you know, when Cao Boi was on our team he was"
427,00:29:44.92,00:29:44.92,"always the one making the fire, starting the fire, tending to"
428,00:29:47.17,00:29:47.17,"the fire. >> Look, guys, I'm the one that"
429,00:29:53.04,00:29:53.04,caused us to lose this challenge and I'm probably the
430,00:29:58.58,00:29:58.58,weakest link. >> Steph just came out of the
431,00:30:04.62,00:30:04.62,"blue and said, ""I'm the weakest link."""
432,00:30:07.08,00:30:07.08,"Stephannie and I are real tight. We got Hikihood love, you"
433,00:30:10.42,00:30:10.42,"know? She's one of my Supremes, so"
434,00:30:12.46,00:30:12.46,"she knows I have her back. But then I think about it, all"
435,00:30:16.04,00:30:16.04,these people are out here trying to play a game and if someone is
436,00:30:19.21,00:30:19.21,"doubting themselves this early, and doesn't want to be here, I'm"
437,00:30:24.17,00:30:24.17,"not going to keep you here. >> You know, rather than have it"
438,00:30:34.04,00:30:34.04,be a surprise to her. >> Give her some respect.
439,00:30:40.04,00:30:40.04,She's given us respect and helped us out in many ways.
440,00:30:43.92,00:30:43.92,>> Exactly. >> We give her the respect she
441,00:30:46.17,00:30:46.17,"gave us, you know what I'm saying?"
442,00:31:24.38,00:31:24.38,>> You want to go fetch coconuts?
443,00:31:41.54,00:31:41.54,>> I know it's important right now as a tribe to keep the
444,00:31:43.67,00:31:43.67,"strong ones in, that we can win more challenges going forward,"
445,00:31:46.25,00:31:46.25,"but then again, it's five women, four men."
446,00:31:49.17,00:31:49.17,"So if we're going to do any type of alliance, it needs to be done"
447,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,"right now, tonight, if any of the women really want to stay"
448,00:31:54.62,00:31:54.62,in the game. I would love to see us girls
449,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,align and take out some of the guys because the guys are
450,00:32:00.00,00:32:00.00,already starting to align together and stick together and
451,00:32:02.58,00:32:02.58,they're the stronger ones. >> So why don't we switch this
452,00:32:05.96,00:32:05.96,up and just have all the girls align right now and get rid of
453,00:32:08.42,00:32:08.42,J.P. >> That's what I said.
454,00:32:10.33,00:32:10.33,"Women should stick together. >> All right, I'm cool with"
455,00:32:12.46,00:32:12.46,that. I'm not ready to go home.
456,00:32:14.46,00:32:14.46,">> Girl, I'm not either. >> Uh-uh."
457,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,>> Right. I can't believe I set myself up like that.
458,00:32:40.33,00:32:40.33,I just should have kept it to myself.
459,00:32:43.92,00:32:43.92,It was just a moment of frustration.
460,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,I'm not giving up. I don't want that perception
461,00:32:48.71,00:32:48.71,hanging over my head. >> Hello.
462,00:32:52.08,00:32:52.08,>> Hello. >> All right.
463,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,>> How? >> Us girls come together.
464,00:33:06.38,00:33:06.38,Are you up for it? >> I'd be up for it.
465,00:33:10.38,00:33:10.38,>> Yeah. >> Is she?
466,00:33:18.42,00:33:18.42,">> I really don't trust him, I don't."
467,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,">> Honestly, I think... >> We need you guys."
468,00:34:24.75,00:34:24.75,I need you. >> I don't completely trust
469,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,Brad. I trust him to a certain degree.
470,00:34:39.96,00:34:39.96,"So whatever Brad chooses to do today, I hope it's for the good"
471,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,of our tribe and not just for himself.
472,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,">> PROBST: Nate, how are you feeling in general in this game"
473,00:35:12.08,00:35:12.08,"right now? >> You know, we've only been"
474,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,"together three, four days. So we're all still feeling the"
475,00:35:15.71,00:35:15.71,waters. I'm not breaking out of my
476,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,shell yet because it could bite me in the butt.
477,00:35:20.96,00:35:20.96,"If you become too powerful, too assertive in the beginning,"
478,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,the rest of them will just eat you up.
479,00:35:26.83,00:35:26.83,">> PROBST: Jenny, is there a leader on this tribe?"
480,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,>> Not-- not really. >> PROBST: And what does that
481,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,"mean, ""No, not really?"" as if there was something underneath"
482,00:35:36.38,00:35:36.38,that. >> You're putting me on the
483,00:35:39.21,00:35:39.21,"spot, aren't you? >> PROBST: It's tribal council,"
484,00:35:41.33,00:35:41.33,it's a game for a million dollars.
485,00:35:43.29,00:35:43.29,I'm trying to figure out what's going on.
486,00:35:45.12,00:35:45.12,">> All right, J.P., don't hate me, but J.P. likes to take"
487,00:35:48.12,00:35:48.12,"command a lot. >> PROBST: So J.P., when Jenny"
488,00:35:52.71,00:35:52.71,"says ""Sorry, don't be mad at me..."""
489,00:35:55.29,00:35:55.29,>> I have no problem with her saying that whatsoever.
490,00:35:57.83,00:35:57.83,"I mean, I don't say, ""Hey, you got to go fish, you got to..."""
491,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,"Matter of fact, there's times I go, ""I'm taking a nap."""
492,00:36:04.58,00:36:04.58,"You know, so, maybe I voice a couple more things, maybe we"
493,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,should do things. But I don't tell anybody how or
494,00:36:08.79,00:36:08.79,"when. >> PROBST: Rebecca, why was it"
495,00:36:12.21,00:36:12.21,"you, Jenny and Steph that were deemed the fire makers for this"
496,00:36:15.21,00:36:15.21,challenge? >> Because we were all really
497,00:36:17.92,00:36:17.92,"confident going in, in terms of making fire."
498,00:36:20.25,00:36:20.25,We've all started fires on a daily basis.
499,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,"And unfortunately, I just couldn't get the right spark."
500,00:36:27.71,00:36:27.71,">> PROBST: Stephannie, would it be fair to vote one of the"
501,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,three of you off tonight simply because you didn't get it done?
502,00:36:33.62,00:36:33.62,">> I would say no, it wouldn't be fair."
503,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,It could have been any one of us up there trying to make that
504,00:36:38.33,00:36:38.33,fire. But that's not what you want
505,00:36:40.46,00:36:40.46,to consider. If you're going to vote someone
506,00:36:42.75,00:36:42.75,"off, you should consider the big picture."
507,00:36:45.42,00:36:45.42,">> PROBST: J.P., while Stephannie was talking, you"
508,00:36:47.50,00:36:47.50,were nodding completely in agreement.
509,00:36:49.79,00:36:49.79,">> Yeah, I mean, okay, I'll put myself out there-- I got my"
510,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,butt kicked on the swimming today.
511,00:36:54.12,00:36:54.12,There was no reason for them to vote me off today.
512,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,"So I agree with Stephannie 100%, it doesn't go according to the"
513,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,challenge. It's not fair.
514,00:37:02.79,00:37:02.79,">> PROBST: Brad, is it too early to ask if there is a philosophy"
515,00:37:06.67,00:37:06.67,that you bring to how you play this game?
516,00:37:10.21,00:37:10.21,>> Trust is a foundation of everything.
517,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,"For me at this point in time, I always like to use the term ""go"
518,00:37:15.58,00:37:15.58,"with your gut,"" and 95% of the time my gut's always right."
519,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,">> PROBST: Parvati, do you trust everybody in this tribe at this"
520,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,"point? >> For the most part, I do"
521,00:37:27.92,00:37:27.92,"trust everyone in this tribe. >> PROBST: How about you,"
522,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,"Stephannie? >> No, I don't trust everyone"
523,00:37:33.33,00:37:33.33,in the tribe. But I do feel comfortable
524,00:37:36.04,00:37:36.04,"enough to share certain things with all of our tribe members,"
525,00:37:38.96,00:37:38.96,yes. So there is a certain level of
526,00:37:41.04,00:37:41.04,trust that I have. But to completely trust?
527,00:37:43.42,00:37:43.42,"This is a game, and I can never do that."
528,00:37:46.46,00:37:46.46,">> PROBST: Rebecca, when you go back to camp tonight, will you"
529,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,be able to let this vote go easily?
530,00:37:52.25,00:37:52.25,>> It won't be easy but it's something that has to be done
531,00:37:54.75,00:37:54.75,so that we can all move on and move forward and get stronger
532,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,so that we don't have to come back here again.
533,00:38:00.96,00:38:00.96,">> PROBST: J.P., you're shaking your head."
534,00:38:02.92,00:38:02.92,"You're dreading this? >> Yeah, I've already told"
535,00:38:05.00,00:38:05.00,myself this will probably be my hardest vote in this game.
536,00:38:09.00,00:38:09.00,">> PROBST: Okay, now that Exile Island has come into play, the"
537,00:38:12.04,00:38:12.04,hidden immunity idol could come up.
538,00:38:14.33,00:38:14.33,"If it gets played, you present it to me after the vote."
539,00:38:17.25,00:38:17.25,"It is time to vote. Stephannie, you're up."
540,00:38:29.17,00:38:29.17,">> Sorry, J.P. It was either you or me."
541,00:38:45.33,00:38:45.33,">> I wish you didn't voice that point of weakness, but you are"
542,00:38:48.04,00:38:48.04,a wonderful and beautiful person and you'll be with me
543,00:38:50.75,00:38:50.75,"the rest of this game. >> J.P., I know you had your"
544,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,game face on and none of us wanted to be played.
545,00:39:05.12,00:39:05.12,Good luck. >> Your wish is my command.
546,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
547,00:39:51.21,00:39:51.21,Once the votes are read the decision is final.
548,00:39:53.42,00:39:53.42,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
549,00:39:55.08,00:39:55.08,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
550,00:39:58.38,00:39:58.38,"First vote, Stephannie. J.P."
551,00:40:10.67,00:40:10.67,"Stephannie. Two votes Stephannie, one vote"

566,00:41:24.42,00:41:24.42,coming. I'm hoping this means you have
567,00:41:26.75,00:41:26.75,a plan on how to get this tribe better together to start
