68,00:05:23.04,00:05:23.04,asking good questions because Ihaven't even thought about any
69,00:05:25.38,00:05:25.38,of this.I didn't have time.
70,00:05:27.46,00:05:27.46,I think probably Adam andParvati told their tribe to
71,00:05:30.21,00:05:30.21,send me to exile.But I don't want the rest of
72,00:05:33.08,00:05:33.08,"the team to think that I havesome special, you know, get out"
73,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,of jail free card from theother team.

78,00:05:50.12,00:05:50.12,about that.My mind is...
79,00:06:08.25,00:06:08.25,>> Feels soft already.(laughter)
80,00:06:16.67,00:06:16.67,>> Like Sunday night football.>> I know.
81,00:06:20.42,00:06:20.42,It was kind of annoying thatthe guys were just sitting and
82,00:06:23.50,00:06:23.50,just waiting there and drinkingall the coconuts they could
83,00:06:26.25,00:06:26.25,"drink and the girls were, youknow, working on improving our"
84,00:06:29.08,00:06:29.08,shelter.They're starting to rule the
85,00:06:31.71,00:06:31.71,roost a little bit.I think they're getting very
86,00:06:34.92,00:06:34.92,comfortable with their positionin this tribe.
87,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,"Because they know that we needthem, they're strong."
88,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,>> No.>> No way.
89,00:06:47.38,00:06:47.38,>> You think they were?>> I don't know.
90,00:06:49.96,00:06:49.96,">> Even if they all do think,what's that going to do to us?"
91,00:06:54.12,00:06:54.12,"Nothing.You know, we're all fired up on"
92,00:06:57.79,00:06:57.79,how dominant and strong we areas a tribe right now.
93,00:07:00.71,00:07:00.71,"As a group of guys we're way,way stronger than the other"
94,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,tribe's group of guys.And I think the testosterone's
95,00:07:08.29,00:07:08.29,flying a little bit and theguys want to stick together.
96,00:07:11.17,00:07:11.17,These girls are going to needmanpower for sure.
97,00:07:13.75,00:07:13.75,So the four guy alliance isdefinitely relaxed.
