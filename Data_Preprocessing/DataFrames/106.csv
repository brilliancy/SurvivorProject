1,00:00:02.37,00:00:02.37,  JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans forced to abandon ship
2,00:00:04.73,00:00:04.73, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:08.60,00:00:08.60," Marooned for 39 days, they must work together"
4,00:00:12.43,00:00:12.43,"  to build shelter, find food and survive the island,"
5,00:00:16.67,00:00:16.67,"  but, ultimately, it is everyone for themselves."
6,00:00:20.93,00:00:20.93," Every third night, they will    hike deep into the jungle"
7,00:00:23.83,00:00:23.83," to take part in the Tribal Council,"
8,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
9,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,"  In the end,  only one will remain"
10,00:00:31.17,00:00:31.17,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
11,00:00:38.90,00:00:38.90, Last week on Survivor:
12,00:00:41.43,00:00:41.43, Tensions at Tagi Tribe    were on the rise.
13,00:00:43.17,00:00:43.17, SUSAN:  You guys wasted three days
14,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77,fishing during the day.
15,00:00:46.23,00:00:46.23,It wasn't a waste.
16,00:00:47.23,00:00:47.23,Did you catch anything?
17,00:00:48.30,00:00:48.30,"No, ma'am."
18,00:00:49.30,00:00:49.30," It was a waste of time, then."
19,00:00:50.77,00:00:50.77, It's expected to get on each other's nerves.
20,00:00:52.70,00:00:52.70," JEFF:  While at Pagong, the mood was downcast."
21,00:00:56.07,00:00:56.07,   GRETCHEN: I think the camp looks trashy.
22,00:00:58.10,00:00:58.10,Something has to happento make
23,00:00:59.53,00:00:59.53, everybody decide to pitch in.
24,00:01:01.17,00:01:01.17," JEFF: But at the reward challenge,"
25,00:01:02.93,00:01:02.93,  Pagong rebounded by winning  a special food prize.
26,00:01:06.23,00:01:06.23,Chicken!
27,00:01:07.30,00:01:07.30,Chicken!
28,00:01:07.30,00:01:07.30,Are you kidding me?
29,00:01:08.30,00:01:08.30,( screaming )
30,00:01:09.43,00:01:09.43,It's so awesomewe got chickens.
31,00:01:11.20,00:01:11.20, JEFF: And a romance began to bloom.
32,00:01:14.63,00:01:14.63, Colleen has joined mein the forest to sleep.
33,00:01:16.20,00:01:16.20, JENNA:  I noticed they seemed to be
34,00:01:17.70,00:01:17.70, spending their nights  out under the stars.
35,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67, I think it's a little romance   going on.
36,00:01:21.10,00:01:21.10,  It's all about sex.
37,00:01:23.83,00:01:23.83," JEFF: Back at Tagi,   Dirk was running on empty."
38,00:01:26.67,00:01:26.67,   You're looking like hell.
39,00:01:27.83,00:01:27.83," DIRK:I've lost a lot of muscle mass,"
40,00:01:29.27,00:01:29.27,  a lot of strength.
41,00:01:30.93,00:01:30.93, JEFF: And his tribe    thought they had
42,00:01:32.77,00:01:32.77, the immunity challenge   wrapped up.
43,00:01:34.27,00:01:34.27,"   We need one rower,  and the rest of us swimming."
44,00:01:36.40,00:01:36.40,I'm a commercial
45,00:01:37.50,00:01:37.50, white-water raft guide.
46,00:01:39.20,00:01:39.20,"  I know Gervase can't swim,  but my guess"
47,00:01:41.50,00:01:41.50," is that they'll put him  in the boat, rowing."
48,00:01:43.63,00:01:43.63,I could beat him  any day of the week.
49,00:01:45.50,00:01:45.50, JEFF:  But their overconfidence    cost them dearly.
50,00:01:48.10,00:01:48.10,"Is that whatyou wanted, Jeff?"
51,00:01:50.33,00:01:50.33,  I got beat by a guywho couldn't even swim.
52,00:01:52.47,00:01:52.47," JEFF: Their loss sent them back to Tribal Council,"
53,00:01:55.17,00:01:55.17,  where the voting alliance  reared its ugly head.
54,00:01:57.63,00:01:57.63,"Dirk, the tribehas spoken."
55,00:02:02.30,00:02:02.30, 11 castaways remain.
56,00:02:04.60,00:02:04.60, Who will be voted off    tonight?
57,00:03:12.67,00:03:12.67,   It's day 16 on the island
58,00:03:14.30,00:03:14.30, and the survivors are starting   to plan for their future.
59,00:03:17.50,00:03:17.50,"  Until now, the two tribes have been adversaries."
60,00:03:20.63,00:03:20.63,"We got it,we got it."
61,00:03:23.37,00:03:23.37,( all cheering )
62,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37, They built separate societies
63,00:03:26.57,00:03:26.57, and have established  their own routines.
64,00:03:29.27,00:03:29.27,  But in the game of Survivor
65,00:03:31.07,00:03:31.07, everything must change.
66,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,  Three days from now
67,00:03:34.40,00:03:34.40, the two tribes will be forced
68,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60, to merge into   a single new tribe.
69,00:03:38.80,00:03:38.80,  Will they continue to vote
70,00:03:40.73,00:03:40.73," along old tribal lines    after the merger,"
71,00:03:43.13,00:03:43.13, or will it be everyone for themselves?
72,00:03:47.10,00:03:47.10,  This week's episode   finds the impending merger
73,00:03:49.10,00:03:49.10,  on everyone's mind.
74,00:03:52.50,00:03:52.50, ( screeching )
75,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40, SUSAN:  We're having a Pagong day.
76,00:04:20.53,00:04:20.53,We're laying arounddoing nothing.
77,00:04:27.00,00:04:27.00,RICHARD: This is an interesting point    in the game right here--
78,00:04:30.13,00:04:30.13,right on the verge of the merge.
79,00:04:32.20,00:04:32.20,"  Two nights before we merge,   it's an interesting time."
80,00:04:34.87,00:04:34.87,"  Change is coming,  as they say."
81,00:04:41.07,00:04:41.07, KELLY: I think it'll be cool when we merge.
82,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,  I think they're nice people.
83,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30, I don't think they're   taking this... seriously.
84,00:04:49.77,00:04:49.77, They're playing Island 90210.
85,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,  They think that they'll go   to their little mud volcano
86,00:04:57.57,00:04:57.57,  and give each other facials
87,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,  and they don't need to really do anything
88,00:05:01.47,00:05:01.47,because they're just here to...
89,00:05:03.00,00:05:03.00," look cute on TV, I don't know."
90,00:05:05.87,00:05:05.87," SUSAN: They better send them   with some supplies,"
91,00:05:07.73,00:05:07.73, that's all I can say.
92,00:05:11.73,00:05:11.73,There's three of themthat we need out of here.
93,00:05:13.63,00:05:13.63,Greg.
94,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63,"Greg, definitely."
95,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50, He's just way too psychotic.
96,00:05:19.80,00:05:19.80,The other one isspeedball-- Jenna.
97,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,She can get oldpretty quickly.
98,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90," SUSAN:  She... yeah, she's going to    grow old real fast on us."
99,00:05:26.33,00:05:26.33,Gervase. He's a pervert.
100,00:05:28.47,00:05:28.47,  He's gone.
101,00:05:32.00,00:05:32.00,And the chickensall better be dead
102,00:05:33.50,00:05:33.50,because they'll bedead when they get here.
103,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67, ( chicken squawking )
104,00:05:43.37,00:05:43.37, JOEL:  One hour to chicken time.
105,00:05:45.43,00:05:45.43,   T-minus one hour.
106,00:05:47.50,00:05:47.50,  We're going to waittill about another hour
107,00:05:49.57,00:05:49.57, and then we're going to chop their head off.
108,00:05:53.40,00:05:53.40,   We'll take  the little nasty one first.
109,00:05:56.13,00:05:56.13,And pull out all their feathers.
110,00:05:58.17,00:05:58.17, ( squawking )
111,00:05:59.60,00:05:59.60, I think not everybody wants to participate
112,00:06:01.60,00:06:01.60,  in the chopping of the head.
113,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,"   I can't-- I mean, come on, it's a little chicken."
114,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,There is not going to bea trace of that thing on Earth.
115,00:06:13.70,00:06:13.70,   GRETCHEN: I don't have    any emotional attachment.
116,00:06:15.60,00:06:15.60,"  From the moment I saw them, they were food."
117,00:06:17.73,00:06:17.73," You know, they never    were pets to me."
118,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27, I don't enjoy killing things.
119,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,"It's not, like,  a thrill to kill something,"
120,00:06:23.77,00:06:23.77,   but anybody who eats meat
121,00:06:25.33,00:06:25.33, has to realize   that somebody killed that.
122,00:06:27.03,00:06:27.03, Someone's killing it for you.
123,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,COLLEEN: I don't want to watch it die.
124,00:06:30.30,00:06:30.30,  I want to have it
125,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,put on my plateand put in front of me.
126,00:06:37.30,00:06:37.30,GERVASE:  I'm missing food the most.
127,00:06:38.87,00:06:38.87,  I could go   for some chicken right now.
128,00:06:40.63,00:06:40.63,"Any kind: baked, fried,  I don't care-- food."
129,00:06:43.90,00:06:43.90,   Go ahead.
130,00:06:44.90,00:06:44.90,  ( laughing )
131,00:06:45.90,00:06:45.90,"One, two, three."
132,00:06:47.97,00:06:47.97, I just like to ignore   that whole aspect
133,00:06:50.33,00:06:50.33,"of, uh, the food chain-- the whole death part."
134,00:06:53.33,00:06:53.33,"If you're going tobe upset about this,"
135,00:06:55.03,00:06:55.03,then you shouldbe a vegetarian
136,00:06:56.53,00:06:56.53,'cause this is howevery animal starts out.
137,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67," JENNA:  Oh, we're going to eat, uh,  three chickens in three days."
138,00:07:02.80,00:07:02.80,  We want to eat thembefore we merge tribes.
139,00:07:04.63,00:07:04.63,   We don't want them  getting any of our chickens.
140,00:07:06.33,00:07:06.33," Besides, one of themwas pecking the hell out of me."
141,00:07:08.77,00:07:08.77,It is the one thatwas pecking me?
142,00:07:10.13,00:07:10.13,"Yeah, that's it."
143,00:07:11.37,00:07:11.37,Sweet justice.
144,00:07:12.73,00:07:12.73,I've interacted   with the chickens
145,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00, as little as possible.
146,00:07:15.57,00:07:15.57," I'm not petting them,    putting them on leashes,"
147,00:07:18.00,00:07:18.00," taking them for walks,   naming them"
148,00:07:20.00,00:07:20.00," and, you know,    calling them my very own."
149,00:07:22.37,00:07:22.37,It does no good  to befriend dinner.
150,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17, JENNA: I've never gone   through the process
151,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17," of feeding a chicken,   watering a chicken,"
152,00:07:28.13,00:07:28.13,  then butchering a chicken.
153,00:07:31.70,00:07:31.70,  Yum.
154,00:07:32.70,00:07:32.70,"Ooh, yeah!"
155,00:07:35.67,00:07:35.67,"I can smell the,like, the grease and..."
156,00:07:39.03,00:07:39.03, And it's going to fry  and bubble and... ( sighs )
157,00:07:43.70,00:07:43.70,  Mmm! Dinner.
158,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,Chicken!
159,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,"Yeah, we're lucky, man."
160,00:07:58.57,00:07:58.57,"Very, very good."
161,00:08:00.87,00:08:00.87,"  Oh, my God."
162,00:08:02.30,00:08:02.30,  Got my greasy flavor   back in my mouth.
163,00:08:04.63,00:08:04.63,"   GRETCHEN:  People were happy before, I know"
164,00:08:06.70,00:08:06.70,  that the nutrition   hit their bodies.
165,00:08:08.37,00:08:08.37,"  It was, I think,  the first really recognizable"
166,00:08:10.87,00:08:10.87,piece of protein  that people have had
167,00:08:12.47,00:08:12.47,"   that, you know, everybody   kind of knew what it was"
168,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,  and make you feel  like you chewed on something.
169,00:08:16.63,00:08:16.63,  ( gristle snapping )
170,00:08:18.30,00:08:18.30,JOEL:Just like alittle kid--
171,00:08:20.07,00:08:20.07,I hit the end ofthe bones andthe marrow...
172,00:08:22.80,00:08:22.80,There's really a lotof protein in there.
173,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,"   GRETCHEN:  I think, mentally, the chicken was more important"
174,00:08:28.23,00:08:28.23, than it was physically.
175,00:08:29.40,00:08:29.40,We have threechickens.
176,00:08:30.57,00:08:30.57,After we're doneeating those...
177,00:08:32.63,00:08:32.63,we're back on track.
178,00:08:41.80,00:08:41.80,RICHARD: It's funny when I hear
179,00:08:43.40,00:08:43.40," ""How come you're naked all the time?"""
180,00:08:45.33,00:08:45.33,I'm naked less than one percent  of the time.
181,00:08:47.53,00:08:47.53,  I'd like to be naked all the time.
182,00:08:49.13,00:08:49.13, That would be smarter  in this 100-degree weather.
183,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,  ( laughing )
184,00:08:55.37,00:08:55.37,Richard's naked.
185,00:08:56.73,00:08:56.73,Is he naked?
186,00:08:59.23,00:08:59.23, KELLY: He walks around naked  quite a bit.
187,00:09:02.80,00:09:02.80,  I think it probably bugs some of the guys.
188,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63, Seems kind of childish   and immature to me
189,00:09:06.77,00:09:06.77,   and kind of grandstanding
190,00:09:08.33,00:09:08.33,   and walking aroundon national TV.
191,00:09:10.10,00:09:10.10,"  Your life, my life, different things-- who cares?"
192,00:09:12.53,00:09:12.53,  Something like that.
193,00:09:14.37,00:09:14.37, RUDY:  He runs around pretty often   without clothes on
194,00:09:16.57,00:09:16.57,  and he don't  think nothing of it.
195,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,Peachy.
196,00:09:19.93,00:09:19.93,  I couldn't care less whether   guys or girls are around.
197,00:09:21.60,00:09:21.60,It doesn't make any difference.
198,00:09:23.33,00:09:23.33,  If there's any horny gay men   out there
199,00:09:24.97,00:09:24.97,"that want a horny guy in return,  I know one."
200,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,"   Naked isn't sexual to me,   and it doesn't..."
201,00:09:29.47,00:09:29.47," I don't think of it that way,  it doesn't faze me that way"
202,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,"so, no, I'm pretty comfortable naked."
203,00:09:35.17,00:09:35.17, RUDY: I don't agree   with his lifestyle
204,00:09:37.73,00:09:37.73,"  and I told him that,"
205,00:09:38.90,00:09:38.90,and he probably don't agree with mine.
206,00:09:43.23,00:09:43.23," But, anyway, we got to work together"
207,00:09:46.40,00:09:46.40," up until this merger, anyway."
208,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,There's moneyat stake.
209,00:09:49.80,00:09:49.80,We're alltrying to win...
210,00:09:51.13,00:09:51.13,"uh, the pot."
211,00:09:53.53,00:09:53.53, RUDY: I finally went along   with this alliance
212,00:09:55.97,00:09:55.97,"  and if I didn't,   I'd be out of here"
213,00:09:57.90,00:09:57.90, probably the next vote   or the one after.
214,00:10:00.77,00:10:00.77,"   I think, with an alliancethat we establish here,"
215,00:10:04.67,00:10:04.67,"   we can do very, very well."
216,00:10:06.77,00:10:06.77,"If you don't, you're out.That's all there is to it."
217,00:10:08.87,00:10:08.87,Exactly. Tell me whatoption you have.
218,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70,RICHARD:  I've been trying to support   keeping Rudy from day one.
219,00:10:12.93,00:10:12.93,   I want to bring him along   to the next round where...
220,00:10:15.73,00:10:15.73,   he won't care much
221,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,"and probably will get voted off before, uh... winning."
222,00:10:20.40,00:10:20.40,You think theywouldn't do it to us?
223,00:10:22.23,00:10:22.23,"No, of coursethey would."
224,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67,RICHARD: I don't think
225,00:10:25.17,00:10:25.17," somebody's in control  of our group, in particular."
226,00:10:27.37,00:10:27.37,   I think...
227,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,  I'm in control of...
228,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80, who's being voted off
229,00:10:34.30,00:10:34.30, and I think that's all  that matters to me.

238,00:11:23.57,00:11:23.57,GERVASE: I made a totally dumb  statement now that I regret.
239,00:11:26.60,00:11:26.60,"You know,it was kind of just"
240,00:11:27.93,00:11:27.93,"  a poke at the girls,give them a little shot."
241,00:11:30.47,00:11:30.47, JENNA:  He sets it up first
242,00:11:32.07,00:11:32.07,"with ""Don't take offense to this, but women are"

247,00:11:43.07,00:11:43.07,You called us stupid.

249,00:11:45.77,00:11:45.77,Don't get me in this.
250,00:11:47.67,00:11:47.67,   The whole context   of the story was--
251,00:11:49.23,00:11:49.23,we were talking  about relationships
252,00:11:50.90,00:11:50.90, and how guys and girls will do stupid things
253,00:11:53.03,00:11:53.03,if you like the person.
254,00:11:54.13,00:11:54.13,"Oh, we nevergot around"
255,00:11:55.27,00:11:55.27,to the stupidthings guys do.
256,00:11:56.70,00:11:56.70,"If you like somebodythat much, you'll do"
257,00:11:58.70,00:11:58.70,something stupidyou should maybe not do.
258,00:12:00.37,00:12:00.37,"We're not as stupid as cows,we're a step above."
259,00:12:02.93,00:12:02.93,"   GRETCHEN: Well, I said,"
260,00:12:04.30,00:12:04.30,"  ""You know, Gervase,  I told those girls"

265,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33, His mouth dropped open  like he had never considered
266,00:12:18.17,00:12:18.17,that maybe that was not the best thing to say
267,00:12:20.83,00:12:20.83,   to a woman who had   that much power over him.
268,00:12:23.00,00:12:23.00," No, I'm being very apologetic because it was stupid."
269,00:12:26.13,00:12:26.13,"  I mean... a-after I said it,  you know, I could..."
270,00:12:28.97,00:12:28.97,   after I said it...
271,00:12:29.97,00:12:29.97,The remorsehe showed...
272,00:12:32.10,00:12:32.10,"   He was, like, in this box   with no fricking way out."
273,00:12:34.13,00:12:34.13,"Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah."
274,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,She was thereto hear it.
275,00:12:37.03,00:12:37.03,"  If you let them talk  long enough,"
276,00:12:38.37,00:12:38.37,they'll probablyget you out of the box.
277,00:12:40.03,00:12:40.03,GERVASE:They probably will.
278,00:12:41.37,00:12:41.37, They're good for that.
279,00:12:42.77,00:12:42.77," Gervase is...   He's on a free ride, man."
280,00:12:45.47,00:12:45.47,   He's untouchable.
281,00:12:47.07,00:12:47.07,  I don't know  how he gets through.
282,00:12:49.87,00:12:49.87,   He called the women cows.
283,00:12:52.13,00:12:52.13,  He doesn't do stuff half the time.
284,00:12:56.33,00:12:56.33,GERVASE: I haven't done
285,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97," a thing out here since I've been here, it seems like,"
286,00:13:01.60,00:13:01.60,and that's cool.
287,00:13:05.07,00:13:05.07, Joel does the fishing.
288,00:13:06.60,00:13:06.60, He does the paddling.
289,00:13:08.27,00:13:08.27,   I'm just out there hanging on the raft with him.
290,00:13:10.27,00:13:10.27,The expert fisherman that I am.
291,00:13:13.33,00:13:13.33,"When they built that hut on the beach,"
292,00:13:14.93,00:13:14.93,   I was nowhere near there.
293,00:13:16.10,00:13:16.10, I was in the shade somewhere.
294,00:13:17.77,00:13:17.77," You know, I was looking   for a coconut or something."
295,00:13:21.03,00:13:21.03,  I think everybody  has done cooking rice
296,00:13:23.07,00:13:23.07, at one point in time.
297,00:13:25.50,00:13:25.50,  I have yet to cook anything.
298,00:13:29.57,00:13:29.57," JENNA:  I didn't see him do anything yesterday,"
299,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,"  but that is nothing new,  and that surprises me"
300,00:13:36.27,00:13:36.27,  that I still haven't   voted for Gervase.
301,00:13:40.77,00:13:40.77," He doesn't seem to pull his own weight,"
302,00:13:42.53,00:13:42.53," and I know for a fact    that he voted against me,"
303,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,so why the hellhaven't I voted for him?
304,00:13:46.70,00:13:46.70, I don't know.
305,00:13:49.40,00:13:49.40,GERVASE:I knew coming herewas all about
306,00:13:50.93,00:13:50.93, charm and personality.
307,00:13:52.20,00:13:52.20,   That will get me through.
308,00:13:55.50,00:13:55.50," His charm does  get him through, you know,"
309,00:13:58.60,00:13:58.60,"   but he hasn't been   so charming today,"
310,00:14:00.23,00:14:00.23,so maybe  he's going to get the vote.
311,00:14:08.30,00:14:08.30, JEFF: The Tagi Tribe
312,00:14:09.77,00:14:09.77, has lost the last two    reward challenges
313,00:14:11.90,00:14:11.90,"  and they're growing  more hungry each day,"
314,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17," but tonight there is another  reward challenge, for food."
315,00:14:17.93,00:14:17.93,  My guess is this is a clue.
316,00:14:20.77,00:14:20.77," ""There once was a base on this island"
317,00:14:22.47,00:14:22.47,"  ""where the soldiers  were known for stockpilin'."
318,00:14:25.40,00:14:25.40," ""The Army's left town,but their stuff's still around."
319,00:14:28.10,00:14:28.10,"Move fast and youmay go home smilin'."""
320,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,Probably a map.
321,00:14:32.07,00:14:32.07,"Oh, there'sfood in here."
322,00:14:33.40,00:14:33.40,We'll be able to eat it  for dinner. Come on.
323,00:14:35.07,00:14:35.07,It's stilldinnertime.
324,00:14:37.73,00:14:37.73,You never know.
325,00:14:39.00,00:14:39.00,What do youthink it is?
326,00:14:40.20,00:14:40.20,Smell anything yet?
327,00:14:42.30,00:14:42.30, Stewed tomatoes. That'd suck.
328,00:14:45.93,00:14:45.93,Looks like dog food.
329,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,"Aw, dog food, man!"
330,00:14:49.10,00:14:49.10,Dog food. That's whatI said right away.
331,00:14:51.43,00:14:51.43,"Smells good, though."
332,00:14:52.77,00:14:52.77,That is definitely dog food.
333,00:14:54.60,00:14:54.60,  Let me see.
334,00:14:55.90,00:14:55.90,"Oh, yeah, Alpo."
335,00:14:57.13,00:14:57.13,"Come on, Rich."
336,00:14:58.27,00:14:58.27,"Yeah, it smellslike beef stew."
337,00:14:59.50,00:14:59.50,"Come on, just taste it."
338,00:15:00.83,00:15:00.83,Just tastea little bit.
339,00:15:01.90,00:15:01.90,  You don't want some?
340,00:15:02.90,00:15:02.90,No.
341,00:15:04.13,00:15:04.13,"Yeah! Go, Rich."
342,00:15:07.13,00:15:07.13,Wow.
343,00:15:08.60,00:15:08.60,All right.
344,00:15:10.37,00:15:10.37,Oh!
345,00:15:11.37,00:15:11.37,Yeah!
346,00:15:16.03,00:15:16.03,It might be ravioli.
347,00:15:17.77,00:15:17.77,"GERVASE: It could be some natural thing from the island, man."
348,00:15:20.63,00:15:20.63,Larvae in tomato sauce.
349,00:15:21.80,00:15:21.80,Nice.
350,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17, We don't know if this even is food.
351,00:15:24.90,00:15:24.90,Maybe just water.
352,00:15:28.50,00:15:28.50,I think it's chili.
353,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,Um...
354,00:15:36.87,00:15:36.87,"I mean, I could thinkit would be dog food."
355,00:15:38.67,00:15:38.67,I-I thinkit might be dog food.
356,00:15:40.13,00:15:40.13,GERVASE: We've just eaten good chicken.
357,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,I'm not goingto ruin that chicken
358,00:15:43.97,00:15:43.97,with damn dog food.
359,00:15:45.20,00:15:45.20,GREG:Go for it.
360,00:15:46.20,00:15:46.20,It's dog food.
361,00:15:50.60,00:15:50.60,Purina Chow-Chow.
362,00:15:51.87,00:15:51.87,"No, I would say Alpo."
363,00:15:53.53,00:15:53.53,Make your coatnice and shiny.
364,00:15:55.00,00:15:55.00,"Yeah, your hairwill look good."
365,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53,"Here, take ataste. Be a man."
366,00:15:58.97,00:15:58.97,Put your finger inthere and eat it.
367,00:16:00.77,00:16:00.77, Are you going   to eat it with me?
368,00:16:02.57,00:16:02.57,"   Oh, cool."
369,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"That's gravy, actually."
370,00:16:07.03,00:16:07.03, You'll want to cook it the whole way.
371,00:16:08.40,00:16:08.40,I don'tunderstand.
372,00:16:09.77,00:16:09.77,It's just dog food.
373,00:16:11.13,00:16:11.13,What if it's dog?
374,00:16:12.57,00:16:12.57, GREG:  I choose my preservatives
375,00:16:14.07,00:16:14.07," and chemicals wisely,  and that really would"

379,00:16:23.37,00:16:23.37,"Over saltines,it's like pate."

381,00:16:27.63,00:16:27.63,  take a dive when you come

383,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,"  When you get hungry,  you'll eat anything."
384,00:16:32.43,00:16:32.43,I took a goodfour or five bites
385,00:16:34.60,00:16:34.60,and I'm...I'm good. You?
386,00:16:36.33,00:16:36.33,"Yeah, I'm done."
387,00:16:37.53,00:16:37.53,You're done.
388,00:16:45.07,00:16:45.07," JEFF: At tonight's reward challenge, we're going to find out"
389,00:16:48.20,00:16:48.20,  just how motivated our hungry tribes are.

391,00:16:54.30,00:16:54.30,  this area was a hot spot  of military activity.
392,00:16:57.43,00:16:57.43," So, the premise   of this challenge:"
393,00:17:01.83,00:17:01.83,  Fleeing troops have just    abandoned their barracks
394,00:17:04.47,00:17:04.47, and left behind    some very useful items...

396,00:17:07.67,00:17:07.67,  two pocketknives...
397,00:17:09.37,00:17:09.37, and two Army helmets.

400,00:17:13.73,00:17:13.73,You'll havea flashlight.
401,00:17:15.10,00:17:15.10,  You'll look for these items.
402,00:17:16.27,00:17:16.27,You can only findone item per person.

404,00:17:21.40,00:17:21.40,"which sort of acts like a baton,"
405,00:17:22.90,00:17:22.90,   to the next personand they go in.
406,00:17:24.03,00:17:24.03,Be careful.

436,00:19:54.00,00:19:54.00,Bummer.
437,00:19:55.87,00:19:55.87,I think we gotsome bad news.
438,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,"Thank you, Rich,thank you."
439,00:19:59.87,00:19:59.87,A pocketknife.
440,00:20:01.30,00:20:01.30,Tough break. You thoughtyou had the can opener.
441,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,"  You actually had the second knife, Pagong's knife."
442,00:20:06.60,00:20:06.60,It goes to them.
443,00:20:07.60,00:20:07.60,That's yourthree items.

445,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,( cheering )
446,00:20:14.47,00:20:14.47,   It's over.
447,00:20:15.97,00:20:15.97,   ( cheering and shrieking )

451,00:20:24.13,00:20:24.13,JEFF:Tagi.
452,00:20:26.27,00:20:26.27,"Sorry, once again,it's a winner-take-all."
453,00:20:28.73,00:20:28.73,"  Pagong, once again,  you're taking all."
454,00:20:30.37,00:20:30.37," Some M.R.E.S, some canned food"
455,00:20:32.70,00:20:32.70," and this, which you might want   to keep away from the fire"
456,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,'cause it willmelt very fast.
457,00:20:37.27,00:20:37.27,And from Jenna.
458,00:20:40.93,00:20:40.93,There goesthe midnight snack.
459,00:20:46.73,00:20:46.73,"   Good night, guys."
460,00:20:48.60,00:20:48.60,Good night.
461,00:21:21.53,00:21:21.53,We are so closeright now to beingthe final six
462,00:21:23.90,00:21:23.90,  people here.
463,00:21:25.00,00:21:25.00,   It's right there.
464,00:21:26.73,00:21:26.73,Now it's lookinglike this is...
465,00:21:28.50,00:21:28.50,"actually couldhappen, like"
466,00:21:30.27,00:21:30.27,   one of uscould actually walk away
467,00:21:31.47,00:21:31.47,"with $1 million,out of our team."
468,00:21:33.23,00:21:33.23,  One more win  and it's in the bag.
469,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83," JOEL:When they do merge these tribes,"
470,00:21:38.63,00:21:38.63," if we're not sticking together   as a team,"
471,00:21:40.40,00:21:40.40,they're just going topick us off one by one.
472,00:21:42.33,00:21:42.33,I just know it'sgoing to happen.
473,00:21:44.00,00:21:44.00,"Tomorrow, we'll just... all of us have to say"
474,00:21:46.20,00:21:46.20,"  either, yes, we're going tostick together or no, we're not."
475,00:21:56.10,00:21:56.10,We have to winthe next immunitychallenge bad.
476,00:21:58.73,00:21:58.73,We have to reallyconcentrate and win.
477,00:22:01.60,00:22:01.60,We need six andthey need four
478,00:22:03.47,00:22:03.47,so we can vote them off.
479,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,"GERVASE:   We need to stick together,really,"
480,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,"   as Pagong, still,and just wipe them out."
481,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,   Just pick them off  one by one.
482,00:22:11.40,00:22:11.40, JOEL:   Colleen-- she said that she does not want to vote
483,00:22:13.73,00:22:13.73,anybody on our team offuntil all of their team is gone.
484,00:22:16.07,00:22:16.07,   We want to stick together.
485,00:22:17.37,00:22:17.37,  Jenna also has said that she is not
486,00:22:19.07,00:22:19.07, going to vote anybody    on our team off.
487,00:22:20.70,00:22:20.70, Greg said openly that he's not
488,00:22:22.47,00:22:22.47, going to vote anybody    on the team off.
489,00:22:23.97,00:22:23.97,  Gervase has said it openly.
490,00:22:26.53,00:22:26.53,  I've said it numerous times openly.
491,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87, I've never heard Gretchen say
492,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07," ""I want to keep  this team together."""
493,00:22:32.77,00:22:32.77,"What do youthink, Gretchen?"
494,00:22:36.23,00:22:36.23,"   GRETCHEN:  I don't see myself   joining a voting alliance,"
495,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,"  but if it's somebodythat I'm thinking of voting off,"
496,00:22:41.37,00:22:41.37,  that would be great.
497,00:22:42.77,00:22:42.77,I'll vote along  with everybody else.
498,00:22:44.53,00:22:44.53,"   If we win,and we go in with an advantage,"
499,00:22:46.93,00:22:46.93,"we just all got   to stick together,"
500,00:22:48.70,00:22:48.70,  stay as a team likewe've been doing all the while.
501,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47,   Joel seems to be ignoringthe fact
502,00:22:53.03,00:22:53.03, that we have one more   immunity challenge
503,00:22:54.53,00:22:54.53," before we combine the tribes,"
504,00:22:56.13,00:22:56.13,"  and if we lose it,"
505,00:22:57.90,00:22:57.90,"  somebody's being voted off,   and he talked way too much"
506,00:23:00.40,00:23:00.40, about what he's going to do  when the tribes are combined
507,00:23:03.37,00:23:03.37,"the strategy, the combination--   da-da-da."
508,00:23:05.57,00:23:05.57,   What if he doesn't make itto the combining of the tribes?
509,00:23:08.30,00:23:08.30,I know that ladies' man
510,00:23:09.87,00:23:09.87,"   has irritated every woman  in this tribe, so..."
511,00:23:13.20,00:23:13.20, JOEL: I'm not a chauvinist.
512,00:23:14.70,00:23:14.70, I believe that a woman can do anything a man can do.
513,00:23:17.87,00:23:17.87,  Joel thinks he's the all-American
514,00:23:19.37,00:23:19.37,and all  of these physical challenges
515,00:23:21.10,00:23:21.10,   are just feeding his ego.
516,00:23:25.17,00:23:25.17,"Go ahead. If you want to compete   with me, I'm fine with it."
517,00:23:29.83,00:23:29.83,"Oh, my."
518,00:23:31.33,00:23:31.33,"  I haven't wrecked anything,"
519,00:23:32.90,00:23:32.90,"   I haven't broken anything,I haven't lost any competitions."
520,00:23:35.53,00:23:35.53,"   You know, he's Golden Boy.   He's Mr. January--"
521,00:23:37.67,00:23:37.67, he's going to have a calendar.
522,00:23:40.17,00:23:40.17,( all cheering )
523,00:23:42.67,00:23:42.67," He's Captain America, really."
524,00:23:44.80,00:23:44.80,  I can't really think   of anything that I've done
525,00:23:47.93,00:23:47.93,  that's bad.
526,00:23:49.63,00:23:49.63,"  Towards us ladies, he seems  to be pretty condescending"
527,00:23:53.27,00:23:53.27,"like, he has to explaineverything so thoroughly"
528,00:23:56.53,00:23:56.53, that we just couldn't  understand it without Joel.
529,00:23:59.73,00:23:59.73,Throw it over thereand then kind of tie itto one of these things.
530,00:24:02.80,00:24:02.80,Let's just try itlike this first.
531,00:24:05.47,00:24:05.47, I know that gamy taste  is going to be pretty harsh.
532,00:24:07.73,00:24:07.73,  I don't see why he feels the need
533,00:24:09.80,00:24:09.80,to treat us like we're children.
534,00:24:12.27,00:24:12.27,I wouldn't prywith that.
535,00:24:13.43,00:24:13.43,I wouldn't prywith the tip of that.
536,00:24:15.07,00:24:15.07,We have a butter knifeover there?
537,00:24:16.40,00:24:16.40,"He is full of, ""Don't do this,"""
538,00:24:18.40,00:24:18.40,"   ""Put it here,"" ""do that,"" ""Watch out,"" da-da-da."
539,00:24:21.13,00:24:21.13," Well, then, get up and do it."
540,00:24:25.93,00:24:25.93, You can't be a woman  who's strong enough
541,00:24:28.57,00:24:28.57,   to volunteer to come here and take what comes...
542,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,You want meto get that for you?
543,00:24:34.10,00:24:34.10, ...and then overlook a comment
544,00:24:36.53,00:24:36.53,   like he doesn't trust you   to cook the rice.
545,00:24:38.47,00:24:38.47,Have we beenthrowing the water
546,00:24:40.30,00:24:40.30,and the rice in thereall at one time?
547,00:24:42.80,00:24:42.80,   Yeah. Why?
548,00:24:44.10,00:24:44.10,I just wondered.
549,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,"Usually, at home,I boil the water"
550,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,and then I throwthe rice in.
551,00:24:49.33,00:24:49.33,  A woman just is not capable
552,00:24:51.27,00:24:51.27,  of doing the things   as good as he is.
553,00:24:53.30,00:24:53.30,We'll go withoutsome rice for a littlewhile and it'll be okay.
554,00:24:56.03,00:24:56.03,"   GRETCHEN: And it took us a while to even   bring it up to each other,"
555,00:24:58.93,00:24:58.93,"  but once we did,    it's, like, ""Oh, you feel"
556,00:25:00.97,00:25:00.97,"that way, too?"" And I know that,   you know, all three of us"
557,00:25:03.83,00:25:03.83,  are feeling that.
558,00:25:05.13,00:25:05.13,"All right, Isaid what I said."
559,00:25:06.57,00:25:06.57,I'm totally square with everything across the board--
560,00:25:09.50,00:25:09.50,   whatever anybody thinks--
561,00:25:11.47,00:25:11.47,"um, but, no, I definitely am not  a chauvinist."
562,00:25:21.13,00:25:21.13," JEFF:For the last immunity challenge   before the merger,"
563,00:25:24.50,00:25:24.50,  an official    U.S. Army obstacle course
564,00:25:26.90,00:25:26.90, has been constructed  by the Green Berets.
565,00:25:29.73,00:25:29.73,"  Hey, Rudy, look behind you."
566,00:25:32.43,00:25:32.43,"Oh, wow."
567,00:25:34.00,00:25:34.00, RUDY:  I was surprised when I seen
568,00:25:36.20,00:25:36.20,  the two Special Forces guys  come down the beach.
569,00:25:39.23,00:25:39.23,"  At first, I thought   they were British marines,"
570,00:25:41.33,00:25:41.33,"  but, uh, they were American."
571,00:25:43.03,00:25:43.03,"Good evening,ladies and gentlemen."
572,00:25:45.40,00:25:45.40,I have your orders here
573,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,your mission statement.
574,00:25:48.53,00:25:48.53,It should answerall the questions.
575,00:25:51.67,00:25:51.67,"It's a biggie, Rudy."
576,00:25:53.40,00:25:53.40,"It's an operation, man."
577,00:25:54.77,00:25:54.77,Uh-oh.

580,00:25:59.90,00:25:59.90,  but not as fast as I used to
581,00:26:02.80,00:26:02.80,"and, uh,it's only going to be..."
582,00:26:05.83,00:26:05.83,"The winner's going to be as fastas your slowest person,"
583,00:26:10.93,00:26:10.93,"so, uh, maybe I can beat   one of the girls."
584,00:26:14.47,00:26:14.47,Appreciate it.
585,00:26:16.60,00:26:16.60,   Thank you.

601,00:27:04.83,00:27:04.83,the tribes have had their minds
602,00:27:06.67,00:27:06.67,on just one thing-- the merger.
603,00:27:09.20,00:27:09.20,"   Tomorrow,   the two tribes become one."
604,00:27:11.43,00:27:11.43,   Nobody can predict   the impact of unification.
605,00:27:13.70,00:27:13.70,"  As new alliances will form,strategies will change."
606,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03,   That makes today's  immunity challenge critical.
607,00:27:19.87,00:27:19.87," If Tagi loses,  they enter the merger"
608,00:27:22.40,00:27:22.40, outnumbered by Pagong   six to four
609,00:27:24.53,00:27:24.53, and could then be eliminated  by a Pagong voting alliance.
610,00:27:28.10,00:27:28.10,We're thinkingwe can do this.
611,00:27:31.20,00:27:31.20," JEFF:  On the other hand,    if Pagong loses,"
612,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90,  the tribes will merge even  at five members each.
613,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13, Joel and Jenna will run
614,00:27:41.60,00:27:41.60, the first half of the course   for Pagong;
615,00:27:43.63,00:27:43.63,  Sean and Kelly for Tagi.
616,00:27:45.13,00:27:45.13, They will meet their   two fellow tribe members--
617,00:27:47.37,00:27:47.37," Rich and Susan for Tagi, and Gretchen and Greg for Pagong--"
618,00:27:52.83,00:27:52.83," at an obstacle called ""blown bridge."""
619,00:27:55.73,00:27:55.73, All four will negotiate  this obstacle
620,00:27:58.30,00:27:58.30," and then race   to the finish line,"
621,00:28:00.50,00:28:00.50,where the tribe members who arenot participating in the race--
622,00:28:03.67,00:28:03.67, Rudy for Tagi
623,00:28:05.30,00:28:05.30, and Colleen and Gervase  for Pagong--
624,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53, are waiting to cheer them on.
625,00:28:09.77,00:28:09.77,Survivors ready?
626,00:28:12.77,00:28:12.77,Go!
627,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"Yeah, you guys!"
628,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,  ( cheering )
629,00:28:36.13,00:28:36.13,"   Let's go, Pagong!"
630,00:28:46.20,00:28:46.20,Come on!
631,00:28:47.70,00:28:47.70,"Come on, Joel,pick up the pace, baby!"
632,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,Come on!
633,00:29:07.60,00:29:07.60,"Throw that ropeback, Jenna, throwthat rope back!"
634,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63,Whoo!
635,00:29:22.90,00:29:22.90,"Come on, Jenna!"
636,00:29:24.53,00:29:24.53,"Go, go, go!"
637,00:29:33.13,00:29:33.13, JEFF:  The blown bridge
638,00:29:34.50,00:29:34.50, requires them  to now stop and think
639,00:29:36.50,00:29:36.50, because this obstacle   involves strategy.
640,00:29:39.17,00:29:39.17,We got to get up...
641,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23, JEFF:  The runners are carrying    the instructions
642,00:29:43.30,00:29:43.30,  on how to proceed.
643,00:29:44.57,00:29:44.57,We have to startfrom here.
644,00:29:46.70,00:29:46.70, JEFF:  Each tribe is givenfour boards of various lengths.
645,00:29:52.47,00:29:52.47,  The object: use the boards to move all four tribe members
646,00:29:57.13,00:29:57.13,  across the pylons   without touching the sand.
647,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,You can onlyuse the tops.
648,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,"Oh, really?"
649,00:30:02.33,00:30:02.33,  We're stillshifting boards around.
650,00:30:04.33,00:30:04.33,"Guys, too short, too short."
651,00:30:06.27,00:30:06.27,We got to...
652,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,   It doesn't matterif they're ahead of you.
653,00:30:09.93,00:30:09.93,  Just take your time.
654,00:30:10.93,00:30:10.93,Watch your hand.
655,00:30:12.37,00:30:12.37,"Okay, get up,get up, get up."
656,00:30:16.77,00:30:16.77,"Well, guess what?"
657,00:30:19.93,00:30:19.93,Okay.

659,00:30:23.77,00:30:23.77,"Come on, come on.Pick it up and handit this way quick."
660,00:30:25.97,00:30:25.97,We got onemore to go.
661,00:30:27.47,00:30:27.47,"   Never panic, never panic,  never panic."
662,00:30:30.60,00:30:30.60,Relax.
663,00:30:31.83,00:30:31.83,Don't worryabout it.
664,00:30:33.17,00:30:33.17,   You don't worry about it.
665,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,"Okay, you guys..."
666,00:30:35.73,00:30:35.73,"I'm down,I'm down."
667,00:30:37.03,00:30:37.03,  We possibly could be ahead.
668,00:30:40.57,00:30:40.57,"Hold on, hold on,Greg, that's okay."
669,00:30:47.67,00:30:47.67,"Come on, Greg, let's go!"

686,00:31:42.53,00:31:42.53, Whoo!
687,00:31:43.77,00:31:43.77,Nice finish.
688,00:31:45.27,00:31:45.27,Nice going.

697,00:32:05.77,00:32:05.77,"  Good job, good job."
698,00:32:07.80,00:32:07.80, JEFF:  Tagi has won and must now   paddle out to Snake Island
699,00:32:11.07,00:32:11.07, to retrieve the immunity idol.
700,00:32:13.77,00:32:13.77,Look for the snakes;you'll find the idol.
701,00:32:15.57,00:32:15.57,"The snakes, we'llfind the idol."
702,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,Yes.
703,00:33:11.00,00:33:11.00,"All right,who did it?"
704,00:33:13.10,00:33:13.10,Who did it?
705,00:33:14.97,00:33:14.97,Who counted that chickenbefore it hatched?
706,00:33:17.97,00:33:17.97,   Who counted the chickens?
707,00:33:19.80,00:33:19.80," JOEL:The thing is, we're coming backafter the challenge, you know--"
708,00:33:23.17,00:33:23.17," I'm sore, you know-- we lost."
709,00:33:24.87,00:33:24.87,"Tired, beat up--   coming back here thinking,"
710,00:33:27.07,00:33:27.07,"""All right, we're goingto have some chicken."""
711,00:33:29.60,00:33:29.60,   Um... coming up the trail
712,00:33:31.53,00:33:31.53,  and what do I see?
713,00:33:33.27,00:33:33.27,  I come around the box...
714,00:33:35.77,00:33:35.77,  and that little one    was still there.
715,00:33:37.83,00:33:37.83,  Had his head stuck in the side of the box.
716,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90, Just pulling. And I yelled and he took off.
717,00:33:41.97,00:33:41.97,  ( hissing )
718,00:33:43.43,00:33:43.43, The monitor got  the biggest meal of the day.
719,00:33:46.40,00:33:46.40," I mean, that monitor  ate twice as much at one meal"
720,00:33:48.53,00:33:48.53," than I've eaten since I've been on this island, man."
721,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,Totally ate my chicken.
722,00:33:52.53,00:33:52.53,"They are vicious, vicious,vicious animals."
723,00:33:55.57,00:33:55.57,"I mean, they look so docilein the wild."
724,00:33:58.53,00:33:58.53,And we're notthrowing it away.
725,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,That's... half thechicken's there.
726,00:34:02.10,00:34:02.10,I guess.
727,00:34:03.67,00:34:03.67,And it's fresh.
728,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,"Poor, poor dinner."
729,00:34:06.53,00:34:06.53,Don't be sad.
730,00:34:08.37,00:34:08.37,"It's all right,though, guys.It's okay."
731,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,"   GRETCHEN:  You boil it long enough,  you can eat anything,"
732,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,and it's already   been tenderized...
733,00:34:16.83,00:34:16.83,"  and gutted and decapitated,"
734,00:34:18.70,00:34:18.70,   so half the work is done.
735,00:34:28.43,00:34:28.43,I don't like goingto Tribal Council.
736,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,( chuckling ):Hmm... really!
737,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,Really.
738,00:34:34.53,00:34:34.53,   GRETCHEN:  The Tribal Council
739,00:34:36.37,00:34:36.37, is a necessary    part of the game.
740,00:34:38.13,00:34:38.13,But it's the nasty part  of the game.
741,00:34:39.87,00:34:39.87, It's the part that I enjoy the least
742,00:34:41.60,00:34:41.60,  and that I could do without.
743,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,I don't know who's going to go.
744,00:34:47.60,00:34:47.60,  Could be anybody.
745,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63, JOEL:  I've seen how Jenna acted
746,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,  the last couple times when   she voted against somebody.
747,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,  She really didn't  want to look at them
748,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,  or talk to them--    she showed guilt
749,00:34:59.10,00:34:59.10,   and she hasn't... she's really been avoiding me
750,00:35:01.20,00:35:01.20, the last couple days.
751,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60," JENNA: I know who my vote is,   and it... it would be Joel,"
752,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83," but, uh, I can't speak   for the rest of the tribe."
753,00:35:09.43,00:35:09.43,"I got a vote last time, so maybe I'll be off."
754,00:35:11.80,00:35:11.80,I don't know.
755,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,There's allthree aces.
756,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,COLLEEN:  Gervase-- he's just as chauvinistic
757,00:35:17.00,00:35:17.00,"as Joel is, God!"
758,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,He just hides it better.
759,00:35:20.10,00:35:20.10,"Oh, are you done?"
760,00:35:21.53,00:35:21.53,Not yet.
761,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63,COLLEEN: I want to vote for him   at the next Tribal Council
762,00:35:26.07,00:35:26.07,"  because he voted for me,"
763,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,"and I'm starting   to just have, like"
764,00:35:28.73,00:35:28.73,these little conflicts with him.
765,00:35:30.47,00:35:30.47,( all groaning )

773,00:35:56.93,00:35:56.93,  and we're all aboutto go back to our lives
774,00:35:59.40,00:35:59.40,  and I won't talk to these guys...
775,00:36:01.30,00:36:01.30,  ( thunder rumbling )
776,00:36:05.27,00:36:05.27, Looks like we're going  to get rained on...
777,00:36:07.93,00:36:07.93,or them.
778,00:36:10.27,00:36:10.27,  I think this stuff's  going to pass by us.

780,00:36:39.13,00:36:39.13,( thunderclap )
781,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17, Okay.
782,00:37:05.83,00:37:05.83,   Another night of reckoning   at Tribal Council.
783,00:37:07.40,00:37:07.40,So tonight's agenda
784,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,is the same as alwaysat Tribal Council.
785,00:37:10.97,00:37:10.97,You guys will have tovote off one member.
786,00:37:13.47,00:37:13.47,"So, before weget to that--"
787,00:37:15.37,00:37:15.37,"Joel, were you surprised to lose today?"
788,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,  You know...
789,00:37:19.63,00:37:19.63,  I don't know  if we were really surprised.
790,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,"  I mean, I knew that"
791,00:37:22.37,00:37:22.37,we were physicallystronger and faster.
792,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,But we pushed it   as hard as we could today
793,00:37:27.57,00:37:27.57,"and, uh, came up a little bit short this time."
794,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,"   It's no big secretabout the, uh..."
795,00:37:32.73,00:37:32.73,comments that were made
796,00:37:34.80,00:37:34.80,regarding women  in comparison to an animal.
797,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,  ( laughing )
798,00:37:39.63,00:37:39.63,"God, those cows!"
799,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"  What was your take on that,   Gretchen?"
800,00:37:43.10,00:37:43.10,"It's being made light of here,but it... from what I gathered,"
801,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87, it wasn't necessarilytaken all that lightly.
802,00:37:47.93,00:37:47.93,"   Um, I wasn't there for the initial conversation."
803,00:37:50.60,00:37:50.60,"They were storytellingat night, I think,"
804,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,   and I don't really believe that Gervase--
805,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,"oh, were we not supposed to say who...?"
806,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,( all laughing )

808,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,"What do youmean, ""Come on""?"
809,00:38:03.50,00:38:03.50,   You didn't say it?
810,00:38:05.20,00:38:05.20,"You know,Jeff..."
811,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,  I do not even recall   saying these words and...
812,00:38:09.90,00:38:09.90,   ( women groaning )
813,00:38:11.10,00:38:11.10,"Oh, my God!"
814,00:38:12.40,00:38:12.40,   I mean...
815,00:38:13.80,00:38:13.80,"   And you know what?You know what, Gervase?"
816,00:38:15.53,00:38:15.53,   Right now is when   they're going to play you
817,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,   saying the words.
818,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,  ( laughing )
819,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,"   It sounds so much   like Joel, though."
820,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,"  When I listen to it,  it sounds so much like Joel."
821,00:38:24.10,00:38:24.10,"""Don't let me offendyou or anything, but..."
822,00:38:27.03,00:38:27.03,"but women are thestupidest thingson Earth..."""
823,00:38:28.90,00:38:28.90,"   So, to clear it up"
824,00:38:30.47,00:38:30.47,"  from your guys' take on it, Jenna,"
825,00:38:32.07,00:38:32.07,  who... did you link Joel in
826,00:38:34.03,00:38:34.03,"that group, also?"
827,00:38:35.10,00:38:35.10,JOEL:I got linkedinto this somehow.
828,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,"Well, uh,it was this thing:"
829,00:38:37.70,00:38:37.70,"( hearty laughter ):""Yeah!"""
830,00:38:39.20,00:38:39.20,It kind of linked him.I don't know.
831,00:38:41.43,00:38:41.43,That's all right.
832,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,Whatever.
833,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"Gervase, lasttime I asked youif you felt..."
834,00:38:47.27,00:38:47.27,"if anybody herefelt invincible,"
835,00:38:48.90,00:38:48.90,you were the firstone to pipe up.
836,00:38:50.53,00:38:50.53,"You said, ""I'm notgoing anywhere."""
837,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,You still feelthat way tonight?
838,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,I refuse to answer that question   on the grounds...
839,00:38:59.23,00:38:59.23,( all laughing )
840,00:39:00.80,00:39:00.80,...that my invincibilitymay be affected by that.
841,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,( all laughing )
842,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,"   So that's a ""yes."""
843,00:39:08.87,00:39:08.87,  Yes!
844,00:39:11.57,00:39:11.57,  I'm feeling   real good tonight.
845,00:39:13.37,00:39:13.37,Why?
846,00:39:15.80,00:39:15.80,"Just because, man, I..."
847,00:39:17.90,00:39:17.90,I don't know what it is.
848,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13,"I mean,  it might just be me, but..."
849,00:39:22.10,00:39:22.10,   I'm feeling good.
850,00:39:23.10,00:39:23.10,JEFF:Anybody herewant to own up
851,00:39:24.53,00:39:24.53,to feelinga little...
852,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,uncertain abouttheir future
853,00:39:28.57,00:39:28.57,in the next fiveto ten minutes?
854,00:39:41.07,00:39:41.07,   It's time to vote.
855,00:39:42.20,00:39:42.20,Joel.
856,00:40:05.23,00:40:05.23,"I just, uh, had to vote."
857,00:40:22.80,00:40:22.80," I picked Joel for two reasons,both small ones."
858,00:40:25.57,00:40:25.57, He seems a bit condescending to women
859,00:40:27.57,00:40:27.57, and it makes    it difficult to work with
860,00:40:29.57,00:40:29.57,"  and, two-- he seems to havethe most money of anybody, so..."
861,00:40:32.10,00:40:32.10, I think he needs to win less.
862,00:40:44.53,00:40:44.53,"  There's no good reason why,"
863,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,"  but it's got to be    for somebody, and, uh..."
864,00:40:49.30,00:40:49.30,   that's who I'm going withfor now.
865,00:40:58.33,00:40:58.33,   It's time
866,00:40:59.90,00:40:59.90,  and he's a little    too condescending
867,00:41:01.53,00:41:01.53,  towards us ladies.
868,00:41:03.30,00:41:03.30,  Moo.
869,00:41:05.97,00:41:05.97,  I'm just a step above a cow.
870,00:41:10.80,00:41:10.80," On the island, fire represents life."
871,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"Here at Tribal Council,"

878,00:41:24.40,00:41:24.40,will be addedto that group.
879,00:41:25.70,00:41:25.70,I'll go tallythe votes.

890,00:42:44.30,00:42:44.30,The tribehas spoken.

892,00:42:52.87,00:42:52.87,Good-bye.
893,00:43:06.00,00:43:06.00,To the rest of you guys:
894,00:43:07.00,00:43:07.00, whole new ball game tomorrow.
895,00:43:08.63,00:43:08.63,Two tribes will merge into one.
896,00:43:10.57,00:43:10.57,You can head backto your camp.
897,00:43:12.13,00:43:12.13,We'll talktomorrow.
898,00:43:13.13,00:43:13.13,Good night.
899,00:43:41.40,00:43:41.40, JEFF: Next week on Survivor:
900,00:43:43.43,00:43:43.43, The two tribes merge into one.
901,00:43:45.13,00:43:45.13,RICHARD: I think it'll be interesting.
902,00:43:47.47,00:43:47.47, I think it'll set up   a whole nother set
903,00:43:50.10,00:43:50.10,   of interpersonal dynamics.
904,00:43:51.80,00:43:51.80, JENNA:  This group will work out    so well.
905,00:43:53.77,00:43:53.77, GREG:  This new group is like...
906,00:43:56.43,00:43:56.43,  it's like a banquet!
907,00:43:57.53,00:43:57.53, RUDY: It's a pain in the ass.
908,00:43:59.37,00:43:59.37," If you want to win this money, you got to get dirty."
909,00:44:07.40,00:44:07.40,I wish I could've made ita little longer.
910,00:44:09.23,00:44:09.23, I think maybe the girls on the team
911,00:44:11.27,00:44:11.27, maybe had a little inferiority complex
912,00:44:13.33,00:44:13.33, that they took some of these remarks wrong.
913,00:44:15.73,00:44:15.73, They think I'm a chauvinist.
914,00:44:17.27,00:44:17.27, I am definitely not.
915,00:44:18.47,00:44:18.47," I mean, so, that is my main regret--"
916,00:44:20.27,00:44:20.27, that I'm going to leave here
917,00:44:21.80,00:44:21.80,"and I got, you know,four people"
918,00:44:23.87,00:44:23.87,that thinkI'm a chauvinist.
