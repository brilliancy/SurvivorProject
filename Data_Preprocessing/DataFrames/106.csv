2,00:00:02.37,00:00:02.37,  JEFF PROBST:   16 Americans forced  to abandon ship
3,00:00:04.73,00:00:04.73, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:08.60,00:00:08.60," Marooned for 39 days,  they must work together"
5,00:00:12.43,00:00:12.43,"  to build shelter, find food  and survive the island,"
6,00:00:16.67,00:00:16.67,"  but, ultimately,  it is everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:20.93,00:00:20.93," Every third night, they will     hike deep into the jungle"
8,00:00:23.83,00:00:23.83," to take part  in the Tribal Council,"
9,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
10,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,"  In the end,   only one will remain"
11,00:00:31.17,00:00:31.17,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
12,00:00:38.90,00:00:38.90, Last week on Survivor:
13,00:00:41.43,00:00:41.43, Tensions at Tagi Tribe     were on the rise.
14,00:00:43.17,00:00:43.17, SUSAN:   You guys wasted three days
15,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77,fishing during the day.
16,00:00:46.23,00:00:46.23,It wasn't a waste.
17,00:00:47.23,00:00:47.23,Did you catch anything?
18,00:00:48.30,00:00:48.30,"No, ma'am."
19,00:00:49.30,00:00:49.30," It was a waste of time, then."
20,00:00:50.77,00:00:50.77, It's expected  to get on each other's nerves.
21,00:00:52.70,00:00:52.70," JEFF:    While at Pagong,  the mood was downcast."
22,00:00:56.07,00:00:56.07,   GRETCHEN:  I think the camp looks trashy.
23,00:00:58.10,00:00:58.10,Something has to happen to make
24,00:00:59.53,00:00:59.53, everybody decide to pitch in.
25,00:01:01.17,00:01:01.17," JEFF:  But at the reward challenge,"
26,00:01:02.93,00:01:02.93,  Pagong rebounded by winning   a special food prize.
27,00:01:06.23,00:01:06.23,Chicken!
28,00:01:07.30,00:01:07.30,Chicken!
29,00:01:07.30,00:01:07.30,Are you kidding me?
30,00:01:08.30,00:01:08.30,( screaming )
31,00:01:09.43,00:01:09.43,It's so awesome we got chickens.
32,00:01:11.20,00:01:11.20, JEFF:  And a romance  began to bloom.
33,00:01:14.63,00:01:14.63, Colleen has joined me in the forest to sleep.
34,00:01:16.20,00:01:16.20, JENNA:   I noticed they seemed to be
35,00:01:17.70,00:01:17.70, spending their nights   out under the stars.
36,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67, I think it's a little romance    going on.
37,00:01:21.10,00:01:21.10,  It's all about sex.
38,00:01:23.83,00:01:23.83," JEFF:  Back at Tagi,    Dirk was running on empty."
39,00:01:26.67,00:01:26.67,   You're looking like hell.
40,00:01:27.83,00:01:27.83," DIRK: I've lost a lot of muscle mass,"
41,00:01:29.27,00:01:29.27,  a lot of strength.
42,00:01:30.93,00:01:30.93, JEFF:  And his tribe     thought they had
43,00:01:32.77,00:01:32.77, the immunity challenge    wrapped up.
44,00:01:34.27,00:01:34.27,"   We need one rower,   and the rest of us swimming."
45,00:01:36.40,00:01:36.40,I'm a commercial
46,00:01:37.50,00:01:37.50, white-water raft guide.
47,00:01:39.20,00:01:39.20,"  I know Gervase can't swim,   but my guess"
48,00:01:41.50,00:01:41.50," is that they'll put him   in the boat, rowing."
49,00:01:43.63,00:01:43.63,I could beat him   any day of the week.
50,00:01:45.50,00:01:45.50, JEFF:    But their overconfidence     cost them dearly.
51,00:01:48.10,00:01:48.10,"Is that what you wanted, Jeff?"
52,00:01:50.33,00:01:50.33,  I got beat by a guy who couldn't even swim.
53,00:01:52.47,00:01:52.47," JEFF:  Their loss sent them  back to Tribal Council,"
54,00:01:55.17,00:01:55.17,  where the voting alliance   reared its ugly head.
55,00:01:57.63,00:01:57.63,"Dirk, the tribe has spoken."
56,00:02:02.30,00:02:02.30, 11 castaways remain.
57,00:02:04.60,00:02:04.60, Who will be voted off     tonight?
58,00:03:12.67,00:03:12.67,   It's day 16 on the island
59,00:03:14.30,00:03:14.30, and the survivors are starting    to plan for their future.
60,00:03:17.50,00:03:17.50,"  Until now, the two tribes  have been adversaries."
61,00:03:20.63,00:03:20.63,"We got it, we got it."
62,00:03:23.37,00:03:23.37,( all cheering )
63,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37, They built separate societies
64,00:03:26.57,00:03:26.57, and have established   their own routines.
65,00:03:29.27,00:03:29.27,  But in the game of Survivor
66,00:03:31.07,00:03:31.07, everything must change.
67,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,  Three days from now
68,00:03:34.40,00:03:34.40, the two tribes will be forced
69,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60, to merge into    a single new tribe.
70,00:03:38.80,00:03:38.80,  Will they continue to vote
71,00:03:40.73,00:03:40.73," along old tribal lines     after the merger,"
72,00:03:43.13,00:03:43.13, or will it be everyone  for themselves?
73,00:03:47.10,00:03:47.10,  This week's episode    finds the impending merger
74,00:03:49.10,00:03:49.10,  on everyone's mind.
75,00:03:52.50,00:03:52.50, ( screeching )
76,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40, SUSAN:   We're having a Pagong day.
77,00:04:20.53,00:04:20.53,We're laying around doing nothing.
78,00:04:27.00,00:04:27.00,RICHARD:  This is an interesting point     in the game right here--
79,00:04:30.13,00:04:30.13,right on the verge of the merge.
80,00:04:32.20,00:04:32.20,"  Two nights before we merge,    it's an interesting time."
81,00:04:34.87,00:04:34.87,"  Change is coming,   as they say."
82,00:04:41.07,00:04:41.07, KELLY:  I think it'll be cool  when we merge.
83,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,  I think they're nice people.
84,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30, I don't think they're    taking this... seriously.
85,00:04:49.77,00:04:49.77, They're playing Island 90210.
86,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,  They think that they'll go    to their little mud volcano
87,00:04:57.57,00:04:57.57,  and give each other facials
88,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,  and they don't need  to really do anything
89,00:05:01.47,00:05:01.47,because they're just here to...
90,00:05:03.00,00:05:03.00," look cute on TV, I don't know."
91,00:05:05.87,00:05:05.87," SUSAN:  They better send them    with some supplies,"
92,00:05:07.73,00:05:07.73, that's all I can say.
93,00:05:11.73,00:05:11.73,There's three of them that we need out of here.
94,00:05:13.63,00:05:13.63,Greg.
95,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63,"Greg, definitely."
96,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50, He's just way too psychotic.
97,00:05:19.80,00:05:19.80,The other one is speedball-- Jenna.
98,00:05:21.83,00:05:21.83,She can get old pretty quickly.
99,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90," SUSAN:   She... yeah, she's going to     grow old real fast on us."
100,00:05:26.33,00:05:26.33,Gervase. He's a pervert.
101,00:05:28.47,00:05:28.47,  He's gone.
102,00:05:32.00,00:05:32.00,And the chickens all better be dead
103,00:05:33.50,00:05:33.50,because they'll be dead when they get here.
104,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67, ( chicken squawking )
105,00:05:43.37,00:05:43.37, JOEL:    One hour to chicken time.
106,00:05:45.43,00:05:45.43,   T-minus one hour.
107,00:05:47.50,00:05:47.50,  We're going to wait till about another hour
108,00:05:49.57,00:05:49.57, and then we're  going to chop their head off.
109,00:05:53.40,00:05:53.40,   We'll take   the little nasty one first.
110,00:05:56.13,00:05:56.13,And pull out all their feathers.
111,00:05:58.17,00:05:58.17, ( squawking )
112,00:05:59.60,00:05:59.60, I think not everybody  wants to participate
113,00:06:01.60,00:06:01.60,  in the chopping of the head.
114,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,"   I can't-- I mean, come on,  it's a little chicken."
115,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,There is not going to be a trace of that thing on Earth.
116,00:06:13.70,00:06:13.70,   GRETCHEN:  I don't have     any emotional attachment.
117,00:06:15.60,00:06:15.60,"  From the moment I saw them,  they were food."
118,00:06:17.73,00:06:17.73," You know, they never     were pets to me."
119,00:06:19.27,00:06:19.27, I don't enjoy killing things.
120,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,"It's not, like,   a thrill to kill something,"
121,00:06:23.77,00:06:23.77,   but anybody who eats meat
122,00:06:25.33,00:06:25.33, has to realize    that somebody killed that.
123,00:06:27.03,00:06:27.03, Someone's killing it for you.
124,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,COLLEEN:  I don't want to watch it die.
125,00:06:30.30,00:06:30.30,  I want to have it
126,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,put on my plate and put in front of me.
127,00:06:37.30,00:06:37.30,GERVASE:   I'm missing food the most.
128,00:06:38.87,00:06:38.87,  I could go    for some chicken right now.
129,00:06:40.63,00:06:40.63,"Any kind: baked, fried,   I don't care-- food."
130,00:06:43.90,00:06:43.90,   Go ahead.
131,00:06:44.90,00:06:44.90,  ( laughing )
132,00:06:45.90,00:06:45.90,"One, two, three."
133,00:06:47.97,00:06:47.97, I just like to ignore    that whole aspect
134,00:06:50.33,00:06:50.33,"of, uh, the food chain--  the whole death part."
135,00:06:53.33,00:06:53.33,"If you're going to be upset about this,"
136,00:06:55.03,00:06:55.03,then you should be a vegetarian
137,00:06:56.53,00:06:56.53,'cause this is how every animal starts out.
138,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67," JENNA:   Oh, we're going to eat, uh,   three chickens in three days."
139,00:07:02.80,00:07:02.80,  We want to eat them before we merge tribes.
140,00:07:04.63,00:07:04.63,   We don't want them   getting any of our chickens.
141,00:07:06.33,00:07:06.33," Besides, one of them was pecking the hell out of me."
142,00:07:08.77,00:07:08.77,It is the one that was pecking me?
143,00:07:10.13,00:07:10.13,"Yeah, that's it."
144,00:07:11.37,00:07:11.37,Sweet justice.
145,00:07:12.73,00:07:12.73,I've interacted    with the chickens
146,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00, as little as possible.
147,00:07:15.57,00:07:15.57," I'm not petting them,     putting them on leashes,"
148,00:07:18.00,00:07:18.00," taking them for walks,    naming them"
149,00:07:20.00,00:07:20.00," and, you know,     calling them my very own."
150,00:07:22.37,00:07:22.37,It does no good   to befriend dinner.
151,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17, JENNA:  I've never gone    through the process
152,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17," of feeding a chicken,    watering a chicken,"
153,00:07:28.13,00:07:28.13,  then butchering a chicken.
154,00:07:31.70,00:07:31.70,  Yum.
155,00:07:32.70,00:07:32.70,"Ooh, yeah!"
156,00:07:35.67,00:07:35.67,"I can smell the, like, the grease and..."
157,00:07:39.03,00:07:39.03, And it's going to fry   and bubble and... ( sighs )
158,00:07:43.70,00:07:43.70,  Mmm! Dinner.
159,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,Chicken!
160,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,"Yeah, we're lucky, man."
161,00:07:58.57,00:07:58.57,"Very, very good."
162,00:08:00.87,00:08:00.87,"  Oh, my God."
163,00:08:02.30,00:08:02.30,  Got my greasy flavor    back in my mouth.
164,00:08:04.63,00:08:04.63,"   GRETCHEN:    People were happy before,  I know"
165,00:08:06.70,00:08:06.70,  that the nutrition    hit their bodies.
166,00:08:08.37,00:08:08.37,"  It was, I think,   the first really recognizable"
167,00:08:10.87,00:08:10.87,piece of protein   that people have had
168,00:08:12.47,00:08:12.47,"   that, you know, everybody    kind of knew what it was"
169,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,  and make you feel   like you chewed on something.
170,00:08:16.63,00:08:16.63,  ( gristle snapping )
171,00:08:18.30,00:08:18.30,JOEL: Just like a little kid--
172,00:08:20.07,00:08:20.07,I hit the end of the bones and the marrow...
173,00:08:22.80,00:08:22.80,There's really a lot of protein in there.
174,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,"   GRETCHEN:   I think, mentally,  the chicken was more important"
175,00:08:28.23,00:08:28.23, than it was physically.
176,00:08:29.40,00:08:29.40,We have three chickens.
177,00:08:30.57,00:08:30.57,After we're done eating those...
178,00:08:32.63,00:08:32.63,we're back on track.
179,00:08:41.80,00:08:41.80,RICHARD:  It's funny when I hear
180,00:08:43.40,00:08:43.40," ""How come you're naked  all the time?"""
181,00:08:45.33,00:08:45.33,I'm naked less than one percent   of the time.
182,00:08:47.53,00:08:47.53,  I'd like to be naked  all the time.
183,00:08:49.13,00:08:49.13, That would be smarter   in this 100-degree weather.
184,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,  ( laughing )
185,00:08:55.37,00:08:55.37,Richard's naked.
186,00:08:56.73,00:08:56.73,Is he naked?
187,00:08:59.23,00:08:59.23, KELLY:  He walks around naked   quite a bit.
188,00:09:02.80,00:09:02.80,  I think it probably  bugs some of the guys.
189,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63, Seems kind of childish    and immature to me
190,00:09:06.77,00:09:06.77,   and kind of grandstanding
191,00:09:08.33,00:09:08.33,   and walking around on national TV.
192,00:09:10.10,00:09:10.10,"  Your life, my life,  different things-- who cares?"
193,00:09:12.53,00:09:12.53,  Something like that.
194,00:09:14.37,00:09:14.37, RUDY:   He runs around pretty often    without clothes on
195,00:09:16.57,00:09:16.57,  and he don't   think nothing of it.
196,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,Peachy.
197,00:09:19.93,00:09:19.93,  I couldn't care less whether    guys or girls are around.
198,00:09:21.60,00:09:21.60,It doesn't make any difference.
199,00:09:23.33,00:09:23.33,  If there's any horny gay men    out there
200,00:09:24.97,00:09:24.97,"that want a horny guy in return,   I know one."
201,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,"   Naked isn't sexual to me,    and it doesn't..."
202,00:09:29.47,00:09:29.47," I don't think of it that way,   it doesn't faze me that way"
203,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,"so, no,  I'm pretty comfortable naked."
204,00:09:35.17,00:09:35.17, RUDY:  I don't agree    with his lifestyle
205,00:09:37.73,00:09:37.73,"  and I told him that,"
206,00:09:38.90,00:09:38.90,and he probably  don't agree with mine.
207,00:09:43.23,00:09:43.23," But, anyway,  we got to work together"
208,00:09:46.40,00:09:46.40," up until this merger, anyway."
209,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,There's money at stake.
210,00:09:49.80,00:09:49.80,We're all trying to win...
211,00:09:51.13,00:09:51.13,"uh, the pot."
212,00:09:53.53,00:09:53.53, RUDY:  I finally went along    with this alliance
213,00:09:55.97,00:09:55.97,"  and if I didn't,    I'd be out of here"
214,00:09:57.90,00:09:57.90, probably the next vote    or the one after.
215,00:10:00.77,00:10:00.77,"   I think, with an alliance that we establish here,"
216,00:10:04.67,00:10:04.67,"   we can do very, very well."
217,00:10:06.77,00:10:06.77,"If you don't, you're out. That's all there is to it."
218,00:10:08.87,00:10:08.87,Exactly. Tell me what option you have.
219,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70,RICHARD:   I've been trying to support    keeping Rudy from day one.
220,00:10:12.93,00:10:12.93,   I want to bring him along    to the next round where...
221,00:10:15.73,00:10:15.73,   he won't care much
222,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,"and probably will get voted off  before, uh... winning."
223,00:10:20.40,00:10:20.40,You think they wouldn't do it to us?
224,00:10:22.23,00:10:22.23,"No, of course they would."
225,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67,RICHARD:  I don't think
226,00:10:25.17,00:10:25.17," somebody's in control   of our group, in particular."
227,00:10:27.37,00:10:27.37,   I think...
228,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,  I'm in control of...
229,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80, who's being voted off
230,00:10:34.30,00:10:34.30, and I think that's all   that matters to me.
231,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,   ( quiet talking )
232,00:10:51.10,00:10:51.10,  ( giggling )

237,00:11:07.00,00:11:07.00," Morning, Greg."
238,00:11:08.23,00:11:08.23,"   Morning, Gretchen."
239,00:11:23.57,00:11:23.57,GERVASE:  I made a totally dumb   statement now that I regret.
240,00:11:26.60,00:11:26.60,"You know, it was kind of just"
241,00:11:27.93,00:11:27.93,"  a poke at the girls, give them a little shot."
242,00:11:30.47,00:11:30.47, JENNA:   He sets it up first
243,00:11:32.07,00:11:32.07,"with ""Don't take offense  to this, but women are"
244,00:11:36.33,00:11:36.33,"  the stupidest things   on the planet next to cows."""

246,00:11:40.67,00:11:40.67," next to cows"" was the remark."
247,00:11:42.07,00:11:42.07,( shrieks )
248,00:11:43.07,00:11:43.07,You called us stupid.
249,00:11:44.50,00:11:44.50,Who? Not me.
250,00:11:45.77,00:11:45.77,Don't get me in this.
251,00:11:47.67,00:11:47.67,   The whole context    of the story was--
252,00:11:49.23,00:11:49.23,we were talking   about relationships
253,00:11:50.90,00:11:50.90, and how guys and girls  will do stupid things
254,00:11:53.03,00:11:53.03,if you like the person.
255,00:11:54.13,00:11:54.13,"Oh, we never got around"
256,00:11:55.27,00:11:55.27,to the stupid things guys do.
257,00:11:56.70,00:11:56.70,"If you like somebody that much, you'll do"
258,00:11:58.70,00:11:58.70,something stupid you should maybe not do.
259,00:12:00.37,00:12:00.37,"We're not as stupid as cows, we're a step above."
260,00:12:02.93,00:12:02.93,"   GRETCHEN:  Well, I said,"
261,00:12:04.30,00:12:04.30,"  ""You know, Gervase,   I told those girls"
262,00:12:06.10,00:12:06.10,"""that all they had to do"
263,00:12:07.63,00:12:07.63,"  ""was, like, when they write your name on that piece of paper"

265,00:12:12.40,00:12:12.40," they can look straight  into the lens and go, 'moo.'"""
266,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33, His mouth dropped open   like he had never considered
267,00:12:18.17,00:12:18.17,that maybe that was not  the best thing to say
268,00:12:20.83,00:12:20.83,   to a woman who had    that much power over him.
269,00:12:23.00,00:12:23.00," No, I'm being very apologetic  because it was stupid."
270,00:12:26.13,00:12:26.13,"  I mean... a-after I said it,   you know, I could..."
271,00:12:28.97,00:12:28.97,   after I said it...
272,00:12:29.97,00:12:29.97,The remorse he showed...
273,00:12:32.10,00:12:32.10,"   He was, like, in this box    with no fricking way out."
274,00:12:34.13,00:12:34.13,"Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah."
275,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,She was there to hear it.
276,00:12:37.03,00:12:37.03,"  If you let them talk   long enough,"
277,00:12:38.37,00:12:38.37,they'll probably get you out of the box.
278,00:12:40.03,00:12:40.03,GERVASE: They probably will.
279,00:12:41.37,00:12:41.37, They're good for that.
280,00:12:42.77,00:12:42.77," Gervase is...    He's on a free ride, man."
281,00:12:45.47,00:12:45.47,   He's untouchable.
282,00:12:47.07,00:12:47.07,  I don't know   how he gets through.
283,00:12:49.87,00:12:49.87,   He called the women cows.
284,00:12:52.13,00:12:52.13,  He doesn't do stuff  half the time.
285,00:12:56.33,00:12:56.33,GERVASE:  I haven't done
286,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97," a thing out here since  I've been here, it seems like,"
287,00:13:01.60,00:13:01.60,and that's cool.
288,00:13:05.07,00:13:05.07, Joel does the fishing.
289,00:13:06.60,00:13:06.60, He does the paddling.
290,00:13:08.27,00:13:08.27,   I'm just out there  hanging on the raft with him.
291,00:13:10.27,00:13:10.27,The expert fisherman that I am.
292,00:13:13.33,00:13:13.33,"When they built  that hut on the beach,"
293,00:13:14.93,00:13:14.93,   I was nowhere near there.
294,00:13:16.10,00:13:16.10, I was in the shade somewhere.
295,00:13:17.77,00:13:17.77," You know, I was looking    for a coconut or something."
296,00:13:21.03,00:13:21.03,  I think everybody   has done cooking rice
297,00:13:23.07,00:13:23.07, at one point in time.
298,00:13:25.50,00:13:25.50,  I have yet to cook anything.
299,00:13:29.57,00:13:29.57," JENNA:    I didn't see him  do anything yesterday,"
300,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,"  but that is nothing new,   and that surprises me"
301,00:13:36.27,00:13:36.27,  that I still haven't    voted for Gervase.
302,00:13:40.77,00:13:40.77," He doesn't seem  to pull his own weight,"
303,00:13:42.53,00:13:42.53," and I know for a fact     that he voted against me,"
304,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,so why the hell haven't I voted for him?
305,00:13:46.70,00:13:46.70, I don't know.
306,00:13:49.40,00:13:49.40,GERVASE: I knew coming here was all about
307,00:13:50.93,00:13:50.93, charm and personality.
308,00:13:52.20,00:13:52.20,   That will get me through.
309,00:13:55.50,00:13:55.50," His charm does   get him through, you know,"
310,00:13:58.60,00:13:58.60,"   but he hasn't been    so charming today,"
311,00:14:00.23,00:14:00.23,so maybe   he's going to get the vote.
312,00:14:08.30,00:14:08.30, JEFF:  The Tagi Tribe
313,00:14:09.77,00:14:09.77, has lost the last two     reward challenges
314,00:14:11.90,00:14:11.90,"  and they're growing   more hungry each day,"
315,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17," but tonight there is another   reward challenge, for food."
316,00:14:17.93,00:14:17.93,  My guess is this is a clue.
317,00:14:20.77,00:14:20.77," ""There once was a base  on this island"
318,00:14:22.47,00:14:22.47,"  ""where the soldiers   were known for stockpilin'."
319,00:14:25.40,00:14:25.40," ""The Army's left town, but their stuff's still around."
320,00:14:28.10,00:14:28.10,"Move fast and you may go home smilin'."""
321,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,Probably a map.
322,00:14:32.07,00:14:32.07,"Oh, there's food in here."
323,00:14:33.40,00:14:33.40,We'll be able to eat it   for dinner. Come on.
324,00:14:35.07,00:14:35.07,It's still dinnertime.
325,00:14:37.73,00:14:37.73,You never know.
326,00:14:39.00,00:14:39.00,What do you think it is?
327,00:14:40.20,00:14:40.20,Smell anything yet?
328,00:14:42.30,00:14:42.30, Stewed tomatoes. That'd suck.
329,00:14:45.93,00:14:45.93,Looks like dog food.
330,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,"Aw, dog food, man!"
331,00:14:49.10,00:14:49.10,Dog food. That's what I said right away.
332,00:14:51.43,00:14:51.43,"Smells good, though."
333,00:14:52.77,00:14:52.77,That is definitely dog food.
334,00:14:54.60,00:14:54.60,  Let me see.
335,00:14:55.90,00:14:55.90,"Oh, yeah, Alpo."
336,00:14:57.13,00:14:57.13,"Come on, Rich."
337,00:14:58.27,00:14:58.27,"Yeah, it smells like beef stew."
338,00:14:59.50,00:14:59.50,"Come on, just taste it."
339,00:15:00.83,00:15:00.83,Just taste a little bit.
340,00:15:01.90,00:15:01.90,  You don't want some?
341,00:15:02.90,00:15:02.90,No.
342,00:15:04.13,00:15:04.13,"Yeah! Go, Rich."
343,00:15:07.13,00:15:07.13,Wow.
344,00:15:08.60,00:15:08.60,All right.
345,00:15:10.37,00:15:10.37,Oh!
346,00:15:11.37,00:15:11.37,Yeah!
347,00:15:16.03,00:15:16.03,It might be ravioli.
348,00:15:17.77,00:15:17.77,"GERVASE:  It could be some natural thing  from the island, man."
349,00:15:20.63,00:15:20.63,Larvae in tomato sauce.
350,00:15:21.80,00:15:21.80,Nice.
351,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17, We don't know  if this even is food.
352,00:15:24.90,00:15:24.90,Maybe just water.
353,00:15:28.50,00:15:28.50,I think it's chili.
354,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,Um...
355,00:15:36.87,00:15:36.87,"I mean, I could think it would be dog food."
356,00:15:38.67,00:15:38.67,I-I think it might be dog food.
357,00:15:40.13,00:15:40.13,GERVASE:  We've just eaten good chicken.
358,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,I'm not going to ruin that chicken
359,00:15:43.97,00:15:43.97,with damn dog food.
360,00:15:45.20,00:15:45.20,GREG: Go for it.
361,00:15:46.20,00:15:46.20,It's dog food.
362,00:15:50.60,00:15:50.60,Purina Chow-Chow.
363,00:15:51.87,00:15:51.87,"No, I would say Alpo."
364,00:15:53.53,00:15:53.53,Make your coat nice and shiny.
365,00:15:55.00,00:15:55.00,"Yeah, your hair will look good."
366,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53,"Here, take a taste. Be a man."
367,00:15:58.97,00:15:58.97,Put your finger in there and eat it.
368,00:16:00.77,00:16:00.77, Are you going    to eat it with me?
369,00:16:02.57,00:16:02.57,"   Oh, cool."
370,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"That's gravy, actually."
371,00:16:07.03,00:16:07.03, You'll want to cook it  the whole way.
372,00:16:08.40,00:16:08.40,I don't understand.
373,00:16:09.77,00:16:09.77,It's just dog food.
374,00:16:11.13,00:16:11.13,What if it's dog?
375,00:16:12.57,00:16:12.57, GREG:    I choose my preservatives
376,00:16:14.07,00:16:14.07," and chemicals wisely,   and that really would"
377,00:16:16.30,00:16:16.30,have thrown everything off-balance.
378,00:16:18.37,00:16:18.37,I just don't recognize most of it.
379,00:16:20.63,00:16:20.63,"I don't recognize any of it, actually."
380,00:16:23.37,00:16:23.37,"Over saltines, it's like pate."
381,00:16:25.20,00:16:25.20," JOEL:  Your standards  definitely, definitely"
382,00:16:27.63,00:16:27.63,  take a dive when you come

385,00:16:32.43,00:16:32.43,I took a good four or five bites
386,00:16:34.60,00:16:34.60,and I'm... I'm good. You?
387,00:16:36.33,00:16:36.33,"Yeah, I'm done."
388,00:16:37.53,00:16:37.53,You're done.
389,00:16:45.07,00:16:45.07," JEFF:  At tonight's reward challenge,  we're going to find out"

398,00:17:09.37,00:17:09.37, and two Army helmets.
399,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,One member from each tribe
400,00:17:12.73,00:17:12.73,will go in together.
401,00:17:13.73,00:17:13.73,You'll have a flashlight.
402,00:17:15.10,00:17:15.10,  You'll look for these items.
403,00:17:16.27,00:17:16.27,You can only find one item per person.
404,00:17:18.97,00:17:18.97,"You come back out, you hand off the flashlight,"
405,00:17:21.40,00:17:21.40,"which sort of acts like a baton,"
406,00:17:22.90,00:17:22.90,   to the next person and they go in.
407,00:17:24.03,00:17:24.03,Be careful.
408,00:17:25.33,00:17:25.33,If you bring back a duplicate item
409,00:17:27.20,00:17:27.20,your tribe will be disqualified.
410,00:17:30.43,00:17:30.43, Here's a little bit about what   you're playing for tonight.
411,00:17:34.47,00:17:34.47,We've got some good canned food.
412,00:17:36.87,00:17:36.87,"Peas, some tuna,"
413,00:17:38.67,00:17:38.67,   a little dessert.
414,00:17:39.67,00:17:39.67,Is that chocolate?
415,00:17:41.07,00:17:41.07,That is chocolate.
416,00:17:42.47,00:17:42.47,First tribe back
417,00:17:44.20,00:17:44.20,   with all the items    on the list wins.
418,00:17:46.33,00:17:46.33,You guys ready?
419,00:17:48.40,00:17:48.40,The tribe is ready!
420,00:17:53.07,00:17:53.07,Go!
421,00:17:54.43,00:17:54.43,"Go, Jenna. All right, all right."
422,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,"Hey, don't knock her down."
423,00:18:19.40,00:18:19.40,I have the Army helmet.
424,00:18:32.50,00:18:32.50,We're close. Here.
425,00:18:33.53,00:18:33.53,I have the Army helmet.
426,00:18:47.03,00:18:47.03," White can opener, pocketknife."
427,00:19:05.63,00:19:05.63, I got the pocketknife.
428,00:19:06.97,00:19:06.97,We need the can opener.
429,00:19:08.47,00:19:08.47, Take the list.
430,00:19:09.53,00:19:09.53,"Can opener, can opener."
431,00:19:11.13,00:19:11.13,"Can opener, Rich!"
432,00:19:30.20,00:19:30.20,Rich! Gervase found the can opener!
433,00:19:33.37,00:19:33.37,"Run, run, run! Run! Move!"
434,00:19:49.07,00:19:49.07,  ( cheering )
435,00:19:50.40,00:19:50.40,  No!
436,00:19:51.60,00:19:51.60,The can opener?
437,00:19:54.00,00:19:54.00,Bummer.
438,00:19:55.87,00:19:55.87,I think we got some bad news.
439,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,"Thank you, Rich, thank you."
440,00:19:59.87,00:19:59.87,A pocketknife.
441,00:20:01.30,00:20:01.30,Tough break. You thought you had the can opener.
442,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,"  You actually had the second  knife, Pagong's knife."
443,00:20:06.60,00:20:06.60,It goes to them.
444,00:20:07.60,00:20:07.60,That's your three items.
445,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,Victory for Pagong.
446,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,( cheering )
447,00:20:14.47,00:20:14.47,   It's over.
448,00:20:15.97,00:20:15.97,   ( cheering and shrieking )
449,00:20:18.10,00:20:18.10,   Chocolate!
450,00:20:20.40,00:20:20.40,None for you!
451,00:20:22.00,00:20:22.00,  Hey.
452,00:20:24.13,00:20:24.13,JEFF: Tagi.
453,00:20:26.27,00:20:26.27,"Sorry, once again, it's a winner-take-all."
454,00:20:28.73,00:20:28.73,"  Pagong, once again,   you're taking all."
455,00:20:30.37,00:20:30.37," Some M.R.E.S, some canned food"
456,00:20:32.70,00:20:32.70," and this, which you might want    to keep away from the fire"
457,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,'cause it will melt very fast.
458,00:20:37.27,00:20:37.27,And from Jenna.
459,00:20:40.93,00:20:40.93,There goes the midnight snack.
460,00:20:46.73,00:20:46.73,"   Good night, guys."
461,00:20:48.60,00:20:48.60,Good night.
462,00:21:21.53,00:21:21.53,We are so close right now to being the final six
463,00:21:23.90,00:21:23.90,  people here.
464,00:21:25.00,00:21:25.00,   It's right there.
465,00:21:26.73,00:21:26.73,Now it's looking like this is...
466,00:21:28.50,00:21:28.50,"actually could happen, like"
467,00:21:30.27,00:21:30.27,   one of us could actually walk away
468,00:21:31.47,00:21:31.47,"with $1 million, out of our team."
469,00:21:33.23,00:21:33.23,  One more win   and it's in the bag.
470,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83," JOEL: When they do merge these tribes,"
471,00:21:38.63,00:21:38.63," if we're not sticking together    as a team,"
472,00:21:40.40,00:21:40.40,they're just going to pick us off one by one.
473,00:21:42.33,00:21:42.33,I just know it's going to happen.
474,00:21:44.00,00:21:44.00,"Tomorrow, we'll just...  all of us have to say"
475,00:21:46.20,00:21:46.20,"  either, yes, we're going to stick together or no, we're not."
476,00:21:56.10,00:21:56.10,We have to win the next immunity challenge bad.
477,00:21:58.73,00:21:58.73,We have to really concentrate and win.
478,00:22:01.60,00:22:01.60,We need six and they need four
479,00:22:03.47,00:22:03.47,so we can vote them off.
480,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,"GERVASE:    We need to stick together, really,"
481,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,"   as Pagong, still, and just wipe them out."
482,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,   Just pick them off   one by one.
483,00:22:11.40,00:22:11.40, JOEL:    Colleen-- she said  that she does not want to vote
484,00:22:13.73,00:22:13.73,anybody on our team off until all of their team is gone.
485,00:22:16.07,00:22:16.07,   We want to stick together.
486,00:22:17.37,00:22:17.37,  Jenna also has said  that she is not
487,00:22:19.07,00:22:19.07, going to vote anybody     on our team off.
488,00:22:20.70,00:22:20.70, Greg said openly that he's not
489,00:22:22.47,00:22:22.47, going to vote anybody     on the team off.
490,00:22:23.97,00:22:23.97,  Gervase has said it openly.
491,00:22:26.53,00:22:26.53,  I've said it  numerous times openly.
492,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87, I've never heard Gretchen say
493,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07," ""I want to keep   this team together."""
494,00:22:32.77,00:22:32.77,"What do you think, Gretchen?"
495,00:22:36.23,00:22:36.23,"   GRETCHEN:   I don't see myself    joining a voting alliance,"
496,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,"  but if it's somebody that I'm thinking of voting off,"
497,00:22:41.37,00:22:41.37,  that would be great.
498,00:22:42.77,00:22:42.77,I'll vote along   with everybody else.
499,00:22:44.53,00:22:44.53,"   If we win, and we go in with an advantage,"
500,00:22:46.93,00:22:46.93,"we just all got    to stick together,"
501,00:22:48.70,00:22:48.70,  stay as a team like we've been doing all the while.
502,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47,   Joel seems to be ignoring the fact
503,00:22:53.03,00:22:53.03, that we have one more    immunity challenge
504,00:22:54.53,00:22:54.53," before we combine the tribes,"
505,00:22:56.13,00:22:56.13,"  and if we lose it,"
506,00:22:57.90,00:22:57.90,"  somebody's being voted off,    and he talked way too much"
507,00:23:00.40,00:23:00.40, about what he's going to do   when the tribes are combined
508,00:23:03.37,00:23:03.37,"the strategy, the combination--    da-da-da."
509,00:23:05.57,00:23:05.57,   What if he doesn't make it to the combining of the tribes?
510,00:23:08.30,00:23:08.30,I know that ladies' man
511,00:23:09.87,00:23:09.87,"   has irritated every woman   in this tribe, so..."
512,00:23:13.20,00:23:13.20, JOEL:  I'm not a chauvinist.
513,00:23:14.70,00:23:14.70, I believe that a woman can do  anything a man can do.
514,00:23:17.87,00:23:17.87,  Joel thinks  he's the all-American
515,00:23:19.37,00:23:19.37,and all   of these physical challenges
516,00:23:21.10,00:23:21.10,   are just feeding his ego.
517,00:23:25.17,00:23:25.17,"Go ahead. If you want to compete    with me, I'm fine with it."
518,00:23:29.83,00:23:29.83,"Oh, my."
519,00:23:31.33,00:23:31.33,"  I haven't wrecked anything,"
520,00:23:32.90,00:23:32.90,"   I haven't broken anything, I haven't lost any competitions."
521,00:23:35.53,00:23:35.53,"   You know, he's Golden Boy.    He's Mr. January--"
522,00:23:37.67,00:23:37.67, he's going to have a calendar.
523,00:23:40.17,00:23:40.17,( all cheering )
524,00:23:42.67,00:23:42.67," He's Captain America, really."
525,00:23:44.80,00:23:44.80,  I can't really think    of anything that I've done
526,00:23:47.93,00:23:47.93,  that's bad.
527,00:23:49.63,00:23:49.63,"  Towards us ladies, he seems   to be pretty condescending"
528,00:23:53.27,00:23:53.27,"like, he has to explain everything so thoroughly"
529,00:23:56.53,00:23:56.53, that we just couldn't   understand it without Joel.
530,00:23:59.73,00:23:59.73,Throw it over there and then kind of tie it to one of these things.
531,00:24:02.80,00:24:02.80,Let's just try it like this first.
532,00:24:05.47,00:24:05.47, I know that gamy taste   is going to be pretty harsh.
533,00:24:07.73,00:24:07.73,  I don't see  why he feels the need
534,00:24:09.80,00:24:09.80,to treat us like we're children.
535,00:24:12.27,00:24:12.27,I wouldn't pry with that.
536,00:24:13.43,00:24:13.43,I wouldn't pry with the tip of that.
537,00:24:15.07,00:24:15.07,We have a butter knife over there?
538,00:24:16.40,00:24:16.40,"He is full of, ""Don't do this,"""
539,00:24:18.40,00:24:18.40,"   ""Put it here,"" ""do that,""  ""Watch out,"" da-da-da."
540,00:24:21.13,00:24:21.13," Well, then, get up and do it."
541,00:24:25.93,00:24:25.93, You can't be a woman   who's strong enough
542,00:24:28.57,00:24:28.57,   to volunteer to come here  and take what comes...
543,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,You want me to get that for you?
544,00:24:34.10,00:24:34.10, ...and then overlook a comment
545,00:24:36.53,00:24:36.53,   like he doesn't trust you    to cook the rice.
546,00:24:38.47,00:24:38.47,Have we been throwing the water
547,00:24:40.30,00:24:40.30,and the rice in there all at one time?
548,00:24:42.80,00:24:42.80,   Yeah. Why?
549,00:24:44.10,00:24:44.10,I just wondered.
550,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,"Usually, at home, I boil the water"
551,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,and then I throw the rice in.
552,00:24:49.33,00:24:49.33,  A woman just is not capable
553,00:24:51.27,00:24:51.27,  of doing the things    as good as he is.
554,00:24:53.30,00:24:53.30,We'll go without some rice for a little while and it'll be okay.
555,00:24:56.03,00:24:56.03,"   GRETCHEN:  And it took us a while to even    bring it up to each other,"
556,00:24:58.93,00:24:58.93,"  but once we did,     it's, like, ""Oh, you feel"
557,00:25:00.97,00:25:00.97,"that way, too?"" And I know that,    you know, all three of us"
558,00:25:03.83,00:25:03.83,  are feeling that.
559,00:25:05.13,00:25:05.13,"All right, I said what I said."
560,00:25:06.57,00:25:06.57,I'm totally square with  everything across the board--
561,00:25:09.50,00:25:09.50,   whatever anybody thinks--
562,00:25:11.47,00:25:11.47,"um, but, no, I definitely am not   a chauvinist."
563,00:25:21.13,00:25:21.13," JEFF: For the last immunity challenge    before the merger,"
564,00:25:24.50,00:25:24.50,  an official     U.S. Army obstacle course
565,00:25:26.90,00:25:26.90, has been constructed   by the Green Berets.
566,00:25:29.73,00:25:29.73,"  Hey, Rudy, look behind you."
567,00:25:32.43,00:25:32.43,"Oh, wow."
568,00:25:34.00,00:25:34.00, RUDY:   I was surprised when I seen
569,00:25:36.20,00:25:36.20,  the two Special Forces guys   come down the beach.
570,00:25:39.23,00:25:39.23,"  At first, I thought    they were British marines,"
571,00:25:41.33,00:25:41.33,"  but, uh, they were American."
572,00:25:43.03,00:25:43.03,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
573,00:25:45.40,00:25:45.40,I have your orders here
574,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,your mission statement.
575,00:25:48.53,00:25:48.53,It should answer all the questions.
576,00:25:51.67,00:25:51.67,"It's a biggie, Rudy."
577,00:25:53.40,00:25:53.40,"It's an operation, man."
578,00:25:54.77,00:25:54.77,Uh-oh.
579,00:25:56.70,00:25:56.70,Snake Island obstacle course.
580,00:25:58.13,00:25:58.13," I can do the obstacle course,"
581,00:25:59.90,00:25:59.90,  but not as fast as I used to
582,00:26:02.80,00:26:02.80,"and, uh, it's only going to be..."
583,00:26:05.83,00:26:05.83,"The winner's going to be as fast as your slowest person,"
584,00:26:10.93,00:26:10.93,"so, uh, maybe I can beat    one of the girls."
585,00:26:14.47,00:26:14.47,Appreciate it.
586,00:26:16.60,00:26:16.60,   Thank you.
587,00:26:28.60,00:26:28.60,Welcome to Pagong.
588,00:26:30.17,00:26:30.17,Thank you.
589,00:26:32.20,00:26:32.20,   I have the orders    for tomorrow's challenge.
590,00:26:34.60,00:26:34.60,Read them; make sure you understand exactly
591,00:26:36.33,00:26:36.33,what's expected of you tomorrow.
592,00:26:37.73,00:26:37.73,I wish you all the best of luck.
593,00:26:39.37,00:26:39.37,"Go in there with a good, positive frame of mind,"
594,00:26:41.20,00:26:41.20, good attitude.
595,00:26:42.37,00:26:42.37,Thank you.
596,00:26:44.23,00:26:44.23,"GERVASE:  We're all going to be excited,     hyped up."
597,00:26:46.73,00:26:46.73,"  I want them to challenge us  and push us, you know,"
598,00:26:49.50,00:26:49.50,"   make us work hard    for this victory,"
599,00:26:51.10,00:26:51.10," 'cause, I mean... we're coming    full steam ahead at them."
600,00:27:01.33,00:27:01.33, JEFF:  Day 18 on the island.
601,00:27:03.07,00:27:03.07," For the past few days,"
602,00:27:04.83,00:27:04.83,the tribes have had their minds
603,00:27:06.67,00:27:06.67,on just one thing-- the merger.
604,00:27:09.20,00:27:09.20,"   Tomorrow,    the two tribes become one."
605,00:27:11.43,00:27:11.43,   Nobody can predict    the impact of unification.
606,00:27:13.70,00:27:13.70,"  As new alliances will form, strategies will change."
607,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03,   That makes today's   immunity challenge critical.
608,00:27:19.87,00:27:19.87," If Tagi loses,   they enter the merger"
609,00:27:22.40,00:27:22.40, outnumbered by Pagong    six to four
610,00:27:24.53,00:27:24.53, and could then be eliminated   by a Pagong voting alliance.
611,00:27:28.10,00:27:28.10,We're thinking we can do this.
612,00:27:31.20,00:27:31.20," JEFF:   On the other hand,     if Pagong loses,"
613,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90,  the tribes will merge even   at five members each.
614,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13, Joel and Jenna will run
615,00:27:41.60,00:27:41.60, the first half of the course    for Pagong;
616,00:27:43.63,00:27:43.63,  Sean and Kelly for Tagi.
617,00:27:45.13,00:27:45.13, They will meet their    two fellow tribe members--
618,00:27:47.37,00:27:47.37," Rich and Susan for Tagi, and  Gretchen and Greg for Pagong--"
619,00:27:52.83,00:27:52.83," at an obstacle called  ""blown bridge."""
620,00:27:55.73,00:27:55.73, All four will negotiate   this obstacle
621,00:27:58.30,00:27:58.30," and then race    to the finish line,"
622,00:28:00.50,00:28:00.50,where the tribe members who are not participating in the race--
623,00:28:03.67,00:28:03.67, Rudy for Tagi
624,00:28:05.30,00:28:05.30, and Colleen and Gervase   for Pagong--
625,00:28:07.53,00:28:07.53, are waiting to cheer them on.
626,00:28:09.77,00:28:09.77,Survivors ready?
627,00:28:12.77,00:28:12.77,Go!
628,00:28:22.67,00:28:22.67,"Yeah, you guys!"
629,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,  ( cheering )
630,00:28:36.13,00:28:36.13,"   Let's go, Pagong!"
631,00:28:46.20,00:28:46.20,Come on!
632,00:28:47.70,00:28:47.70,"Come on, Joel, pick up the pace, baby!"
633,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,Come on!
634,00:29:07.60,00:29:07.60,"Throw that rope back, Jenna, throw that rope back!"
635,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63,Whoo!
636,00:29:22.90,00:29:22.90,"Come on, Jenna!"
637,00:29:24.53,00:29:24.53,"Go, go, go!"
638,00:29:33.13,00:29:33.13, JEFF:    The blown bridge
639,00:29:34.50,00:29:34.50, requires them   to now stop and think
640,00:29:36.50,00:29:36.50, because this obstacle    involves strategy.
641,00:29:39.17,00:29:39.17,We got to get up...
642,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23, JEFF:    The runners are carrying     the instructions
643,00:29:43.30,00:29:43.30,  on how to proceed.
644,00:29:44.57,00:29:44.57,We have to start from here.
645,00:29:46.70,00:29:46.70, JEFF:   Each tribe is given four boards of various lengths.
646,00:29:52.47,00:29:52.47,  The object: use the boards  to move all four tribe members
647,00:29:57.13,00:29:57.13,  across the pylons    without touching the sand.
648,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,You can only use the tops.
649,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,"Oh, really?"
650,00:30:02.33,00:30:02.33,  We're still shifting boards around.
651,00:30:04.33,00:30:04.33,"Guys, too short, too short."
652,00:30:06.27,00:30:06.27,We got to...
653,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,   It doesn't matter if they're ahead of you.
654,00:30:09.93,00:30:09.93,  Just take your time.
655,00:30:10.93,00:30:10.93,Watch your hand.
656,00:30:12.37,00:30:12.37,"Okay, get up, get up, get up."
657,00:30:16.77,00:30:16.77,"Well, guess what?"
658,00:30:19.93,00:30:19.93,Okay.
659,00:30:21.33,00:30:21.33,You got... give me something else.
660,00:30:23.77,00:30:23.77,"Come on, come on. Pick it up and hand it this way quick."
661,00:30:25.97,00:30:25.97,We got one more to go.
662,00:30:27.47,00:30:27.47,"   Never panic, never panic,   never panic."
663,00:30:30.60,00:30:30.60,Relax.
664,00:30:31.83,00:30:31.83,Don't worry about it.
665,00:30:33.17,00:30:33.17,   You don't worry about it.
666,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,"Okay, you guys..."
667,00:30:35.73,00:30:35.73,"I'm down, I'm down."
668,00:30:37.03,00:30:37.03,  We possibly could be ahead.
669,00:30:40.57,00:30:40.57,"Hold on, hold on, Greg, that's okay."
670,00:30:47.67,00:30:47.67,"Come on, Greg, let's go!"
671,00:30:54.83,00:30:54.83,  ( cheering )
672,00:30:57.57,00:30:57.57,"   Yeah, go!"
673,00:31:01.60,00:31:01.60,Let's go! Let's go!
674,00:31:13.10,00:31:13.10,Let's go! Come on!
675,00:31:16.03,00:31:16.03,Let's go!
676,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,Get to that stick!
677,00:31:19.77,00:31:19.77,"Let's go, Jenna!"
678,00:31:21.97,00:31:21.97,Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!
679,00:31:25.50,00:31:25.50,"Go, go!"
680,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,Come on!
681,00:31:28.50,00:31:28.50,Let's go!
682,00:31:30.00,00:31:30.00,Come on!
683,00:31:31.50,00:31:31.50,Move it! Move it!
684,00:31:32.93,00:31:32.93,"Move it, move it! Come on!"
685,00:31:35.67,00:31:35.67,"Go, go! Go!"
686,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,Don't stop! Don't stop!
687,00:31:42.53,00:31:42.53, Whoo!
688,00:31:43.77,00:31:43.77,Nice finish.
689,00:31:45.27,00:31:45.27,Nice going.
690,00:31:46.77,00:31:46.77,"Nice going, you guys."
691,00:31:48.77,00:31:48.77,"Outstanding, outstanding."
692,00:31:52.17,00:31:52.17,Outstanding.
693,00:31:53.97,00:31:53.97,Outstanding.
694,00:31:55.30,00:31:55.30,Outstanding.
695,00:31:58.63,00:31:58.63,"Sue, give me a hug."
696,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,Wow.
697,00:32:04.07,00:32:04.07,"Suck it up, man."
698,00:32:05.77,00:32:05.77,"  Good job, good job."
699,00:32:07.80,00:32:07.80, JEFF:    Tagi has won and must now    paddle out to Snake Island
700,00:32:11.07,00:32:11.07, to retrieve the immunity idol.
701,00:32:13.77,00:32:13.77,Look for the snakes; you'll find the idol.
702,00:32:15.57,00:32:15.57,"The snakes, we'll find the idol."
703,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,Yes.
704,00:33:11.00,00:33:11.00,"All right, who did it?"
705,00:33:13.10,00:33:13.10,Who did it?
706,00:33:14.97,00:33:14.97,Who counted that chicken before it hatched?
707,00:33:17.97,00:33:17.97,   Who counted the chickens?
708,00:33:19.80,00:33:19.80," JOEL: The thing is, we're coming back after the challenge, you know--"
709,00:33:23.17,00:33:23.17," I'm sore, you know-- we lost."
710,00:33:24.87,00:33:24.87,"Tired, beat up--    coming back here thinking,"
711,00:33:27.07,00:33:27.07,"""All right, we're going to have some chicken."""
712,00:33:29.60,00:33:29.60,   Um... coming up the trail
713,00:33:31.53,00:33:31.53,  and what do I see?
714,00:33:33.27,00:33:33.27,  I come around the box...
715,00:33:35.77,00:33:35.77,  and that little one     was still there.
716,00:33:37.83,00:33:37.83,  Had his head  stuck in the side of the box.
717,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90, Just pulling.  And I yelled and he took off.
718,00:33:41.97,00:33:41.97,  ( hissing )
719,00:33:43.43,00:33:43.43, The monitor got   the biggest meal of the day.
720,00:33:46.40,00:33:46.40," I mean, that monitor   ate twice as much at one meal"
721,00:33:48.53,00:33:48.53," than I've eaten since  I've been on this island, man."
722,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,Totally ate my chicken.
723,00:33:52.53,00:33:52.53,"They are vicious, vicious, vicious animals."
724,00:33:55.57,00:33:55.57,"I mean, they look so docile in the wild."
725,00:33:58.53,00:33:58.53,And we're not throwing it away.
726,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,That's... half the chicken's there.
727,00:34:02.10,00:34:02.10,I guess.
728,00:34:03.67,00:34:03.67,And it's fresh.
729,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,"Poor, poor dinner."
730,00:34:06.53,00:34:06.53,Don't be sad.
731,00:34:08.37,00:34:08.37,"It's all right, though, guys. It's okay."
732,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,"   GRETCHEN:    You boil it long enough,   you can eat anything,"
733,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,and it's already    been tenderized...
734,00:34:16.83,00:34:16.83,"  and gutted and decapitated,"
735,00:34:18.70,00:34:18.70,   so half the work is done.
736,00:34:28.43,00:34:28.43,I don't like going to Tribal Council.
737,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,( chuckling ): Hmm... really!
738,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,Really.
739,00:34:34.53,00:34:34.53,   GRETCHEN:   The Tribal Council
740,00:34:36.37,00:34:36.37, is a necessary     part of the game.
741,00:34:38.13,00:34:38.13,But it's the nasty part   of the game.
742,00:34:39.87,00:34:39.87, It's the part  that I enjoy the least
743,00:34:41.60,00:34:41.60,  and that I could do without.
744,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,I don't know who's going to go.
745,00:34:47.60,00:34:47.60,  Could be anybody.
746,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63, JOEL:    I've seen how Jenna acted
747,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,  the last couple times when    she voted against somebody.
748,00:34:55.60,00:34:55.60,  She really didn't   want to look at them
749,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,  or talk to them--     she showed guilt
750,00:34:59.10,00:34:59.10,   and she hasn't...  she's really been avoiding me
751,00:35:01.20,00:35:01.20, the last couple days.
752,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60," JENNA:  I know who my vote is,    and it... it would be Joel,"
753,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83," but, uh, I can't speak    for the rest of the tribe."
754,00:35:09.43,00:35:09.43,"I got a vote last time,  so maybe I'll be off."
755,00:35:11.80,00:35:11.80,I don't know.
756,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,There's all three aces.
757,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,COLLEEN:   Gervase-- he's just  as chauvinistic
758,00:35:17.00,00:35:17.00,"as Joel is, God!"
759,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,He just hides it better.
760,00:35:20.10,00:35:20.10,"Oh, are you done?"
761,00:35:21.53,00:35:21.53,Not yet.
762,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63,COLLEEN:  I want to vote for him    at the next Tribal Council
763,00:35:26.07,00:35:26.07,"  because he voted for me,"
764,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,"and I'm starting    to just have, like"
765,00:35:28.73,00:35:28.73,these little conflicts with him.
766,00:35:30.47,00:35:30.47,( all groaning )
767,00:35:31.77,00:35:31.77,"GERVASE: Oh, my God!"
768,00:35:34.63,00:35:34.63,COLLEEN:  This game is much too vicious   for my blood.
769,00:35:45.33,00:35:45.33,  ( thunder rumbling )
770,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57," I'm going to be back home and be, like, ""God, that's so easy."""
771,00:35:50.37,00:35:50.37,"GERVASE: I feel like, when we go,"
772,00:35:51.73,00:35:51.73,"   to Tribal Council and boot one person off,"
773,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,   feels like this is the end of our Survivor run here
774,00:35:56.93,00:35:56.93,  and we're all about to go back to our lives
775,00:35:59.40,00:35:59.40,  and I won't  talk to these guys...
776,00:36:01.30,00:36:01.30,  ( thunder rumbling )
777,00:36:05.27,00:36:05.27, Looks like we're going   to get rained on...
778,00:36:07.93,00:36:07.93,or them.
779,00:36:10.27,00:36:10.27,  I think this stuff's   going to pass by us.
780,00:36:28.33,00:36:28.33,  ( whooping )
781,00:36:39.13,00:36:39.13,( thunderclap )
782,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17, Okay.
783,00:37:05.83,00:37:05.83,   Another night of reckoning    at Tribal Council.
784,00:37:07.40,00:37:07.40,So tonight's agenda
785,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,is the same as always at Tribal Council.
786,00:37:10.97,00:37:10.97,You guys will have to vote off one member.
787,00:37:13.47,00:37:13.47,"So, before we get to that--"
788,00:37:15.37,00:37:15.37,"Joel, were you surprised  to lose today?"
789,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,  You know...
790,00:37:19.63,00:37:19.63,  I don't know   if we were really surprised.
791,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,"  I mean, I knew that"
792,00:37:22.37,00:37:22.37,we were physically stronger and faster.
793,00:37:25.27,00:37:25.27,But we pushed it    as hard as we could today
794,00:37:27.57,00:37:27.57,"and, uh, came up  a little bit short this time."
795,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,"   It's no big secret about the, uh..."
796,00:37:32.73,00:37:32.73,comments that were made
797,00:37:34.80,00:37:34.80,regarding women   in comparison to an animal.
798,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,  ( laughing )
799,00:37:39.63,00:37:39.63,"God, those cows!"
800,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"  What was your take on that,    Gretchen?"
801,00:37:43.10,00:37:43.10,"It's being made light of here, but it... from what I gathered,"
802,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87, it wasn't necessarily taken all that lightly.
803,00:37:47.93,00:37:47.93,"   Um, I wasn't there  for the initial conversation."
804,00:37:50.60,00:37:50.60,"They were storytelling at night, I think,"
805,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,   and I don't really believe  that Gervase--
806,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,"oh, were we not supposed  to say who...?"
807,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,( all laughing )
808,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,Come on!
809,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,"What do you mean, ""Come on""?"
810,00:38:03.50,00:38:03.50,   You didn't say it?
811,00:38:05.20,00:38:05.20,"You know, Jeff..."
812,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,  I do not even recall    saying these words and...
813,00:38:09.90,00:38:09.90,   ( women groaning )
814,00:38:11.10,00:38:11.10,"Oh, my God!"
815,00:38:12.40,00:38:12.40,   I mean...
816,00:38:13.80,00:38:13.80,"   And you know what? You know what, Gervase?"
817,00:38:15.53,00:38:15.53,   Right now is when    they're going to play you
818,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,   saying the words.
819,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,  ( laughing )
820,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,"   It sounds so much    like Joel, though."
821,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,"  When I listen to it,   it sounds so much like Joel."
822,00:38:24.10,00:38:24.10,"""Don't let me offend you or anything, but..."
823,00:38:27.03,00:38:27.03,"but women are the stupidest things on Earth..."""
824,00:38:28.90,00:38:28.90,"   So, to clear it up"
825,00:38:30.47,00:38:30.47,"  from your guys' take  on it, Jenna,"
826,00:38:32.07,00:38:32.07,  who... did you link Joel in
827,00:38:34.03,00:38:34.03,"that group, also?"
828,00:38:35.10,00:38:35.10,JOEL: I got linked into this somehow.
829,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,"Well, uh, it was this thing:"
830,00:38:37.70,00:38:37.70,"( hearty laughter ): ""Yeah!"""
831,00:38:39.20,00:38:39.20,It kind of linked him. I don't know.
832,00:38:41.43,00:38:41.43,That's all right.
833,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,Whatever.
834,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"Gervase, last time I asked you if you felt..."
835,00:38:47.27,00:38:47.27,"if anybody here felt invincible,"
836,00:38:48.90,00:38:48.90,you were the first one to pipe up.
837,00:38:50.53,00:38:50.53,"You said, ""I'm not going anywhere."""
838,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,You still feel that way tonight?
839,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,I refuse to answer that question    on the grounds...
840,00:38:59.23,00:38:59.23,( all laughing )
841,00:39:00.80,00:39:00.80,...that my invincibility may be affected by that.
842,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,( all laughing )
843,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,"   So that's a ""yes."""
844,00:39:08.87,00:39:08.87,  Yes!
845,00:39:11.57,00:39:11.57,  I'm feeling    real good tonight.
846,00:39:13.37,00:39:13.37,Why?
847,00:39:15.80,00:39:15.80,"Just because, man, I..."
848,00:39:17.90,00:39:17.90,I don't know what it is.
849,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13,"I mean,   it might just be me, but..."
850,00:39:22.10,00:39:22.10,   I'm feeling good.
851,00:39:23.10,00:39:23.10,JEFF: Anybody here want to own up
852,00:39:24.53,00:39:24.53,to feeling a little...
853,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,uncertain about their future
854,00:39:28.57,00:39:28.57,in the next five to ten minutes?
855,00:39:41.07,00:39:41.07,   It's time to vote.
856,00:39:42.20,00:39:42.20,Joel.
857,00:40:05.23,00:40:05.23,"I just, uh, had to vote."
858,00:40:22.80,00:40:22.80," I picked Joel for two reasons, both small ones."
859,00:40:25.57,00:40:25.57, He seems a bit  condescending to women
860,00:40:27.57,00:40:27.57, and it makes     it difficult to work with
861,00:40:29.57,00:40:29.57,"  and, two-- he seems to have the most money of anybody, so..."
862,00:40:32.10,00:40:32.10, I think he needs to win less.
863,00:40:44.53,00:40:44.53,"  There's no good reason why,"
864,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,"  but it's got to be     for somebody, and, uh..."
865,00:40:49.30,00:40:49.30,   that's who I'm going with for now.
866,00:40:58.33,00:40:58.33,   It's time
867,00:40:59.90,00:40:59.90,  and he's a little     too condescending
868,00:41:01.53,00:41:01.53,  towards us ladies.
869,00:41:03.30,00:41:03.30,  Moo.
870,00:41:05.97,00:41:05.97,  I'm just a step above a cow.
871,00:41:10.80,00:41:10.80," On the island,  fire represents life."
872,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"Here at Tribal Council,"
873,00:41:14.23,00:41:14.23,your torches represent
874,00:41:15.47,00:41:15.47,"your life, your identity."
875,00:41:17.07,00:41:17.07,Directly across from you
876,00:41:18.37,00:41:18.37,are the five torches
877,00:41:20.37,00:41:20.37,from the first five people voted off.
878,00:41:23.23,00:41:23.23,"Tonight, one of your torches"
879,00:41:24.40,00:41:24.40,will be added to that group.
880,00:41:25.70,00:41:25.70,I'll go tally the votes.
881,00:41:39.17,00:41:39.17,Let's read the votes.
882,00:41:46.53,00:41:46.53,  First vote:
883,00:41:49.33,00:41:49.33,"""Joel."""
884,00:41:55.77,00:41:55.77,"""Jenna."""
885,00:41:58.57,00:41:58.57,"""Joel."""
886,00:42:08.27,00:42:08.27,"""Jenna."""
887,00:42:10.03,00:42:10.03,"Two votes for Joel, two votes for Jenna."
888,00:42:17.73,00:42:17.73,"""Joel."""
889,00:42:20.97,00:42:20.97,Last vote.
890,00:42:26.53,00:42:26.53,"""Joel."""
891,00:42:44.30,00:42:44.30,The tribe has spoken.
892,00:42:51.43,00:42:51.43,It's time for you to go.
893,00:42:52.87,00:42:52.87,Good-bye.
894,00:43:06.00,00:43:06.00,To the rest of you guys:
895,00:43:07.00,00:43:07.00, whole new ball game tomorrow.
896,00:43:08.63,00:43:08.63,Two tribes will merge into one.
897,00:43:10.57,00:43:10.57,You can head back to your camp.
898,00:43:12.13,00:43:12.13,We'll talk tomorrow.
899,00:43:13.13,00:43:13.13,Good night.
900,00:43:41.40,00:43:41.40, JEFF:  Next week on Survivor:
901,00:43:43.43,00:43:43.43, The two tribes  merge into one.
902,00:43:45.13,00:43:45.13,RICHARD:  I think it'll be interesting.
903,00:43:47.47,00:43:47.47, I think it'll set up    a whole nother set
904,00:43:50.10,00:43:50.10,   of interpersonal dynamics.
905,00:43:51.80,00:43:51.80, JENNA:    This group will work out     so well.
906,00:43:53.77,00:43:53.77, GREG:    This new group is like...
907,00:43:56.43,00:43:56.43,  it's like a banquet!
908,00:43:57.53,00:43:57.53, RUDY:  It's a pain in the ass.
909,00:43:59.37,00:43:59.37," If you want to win this money,  you got to get dirty."
910,00:44:07.40,00:44:07.40,I wish I could've made it a little longer.
911,00:44:09.23,00:44:09.23, I think maybe  the girls on the team
912,00:44:11.27,00:44:11.27, maybe had a little  inferiority complex
913,00:44:13.33,00:44:13.33, that they took some  of these remarks wrong.
914,00:44:15.73,00:44:15.73, They think  I'm a chauvinist.
915,00:44:17.27,00:44:17.27, I am definitely not.
916,00:44:18.47,00:44:18.47," I mean, so, that  is my main regret--"
917,00:44:20.27,00:44:20.27, that I'm going  to leave here
918,00:44:21.80,00:44:21.80,"and I got, you know, four people"
919,00:44:23.87,00:44:23.87,that think I'm a chauvinist.
