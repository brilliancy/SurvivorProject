437,00:23:31.54,00:23:31.54,it's going to fun to pick a girlto not get voted off.

450,00:24:02.04,00:24:02.04,Tribal Council I'm almostpositive it's going to be a tie.
451,00:24:05.25,00:24:05.25,"I mean, me and Twila had one ofour famous fights this morning,"
452,00:24:08.04,00:24:08.04,so I think that me and Julie andLisa and Eliza are going to be
453,00:24:12.04,00:24:12.04,"voting for Twila, and I'm prettysure that Leann and Ami and"
454,00:24:15.83,00:24:15.83,Twila and Scout will be votingfor me tonight.
455,00:24:18.42,00:24:18.42,"But, there's still individualimmunity to be given out, too,"

458,00:24:31.46,00:24:31.46,"Man, oh, man.We won the reward challenge."
459,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,"It was a great feeling.And then, after that, we ran"
460,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,"into the immunity challenge.Out of most of the other guys, I"
461,00:24:43.96,00:24:43.96,"needed it the most, so I thinkthat I'm going to be quite"
462,00:24:47.00,00:24:47.00,vulnerable tonight.I would actually like to use the

599,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,do about the vote.It just had to do about Twila's
600,00:35:24.58,00:35:24.58,"comments about the young onesnot doing anything, not pulling"
601,00:35:28.17,00:35:28.17,"their weight.And it really did upset me, so I"
602,00:35:31.08,00:35:31.08,confronted her about it thismorning.

612,00:36:00.12,00:36:00.12,"without that bridge, it'sfrustrating, and I think Mia got"
613,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,frustrated.>> They haven't given me
614,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"an opportunity to talk to them.I mean, why would I want to walk"
615,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,up to somebody that rolls theireyes at me all the time and acts
616,00:36:11.04,00:36:11.04,like they can't stand to bearound me?
617,00:36:12.71,00:36:12.71,"Why would I even want to try?>> Twila, you talk to me in"

621,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,>> You have plenty ofconversations with everybody

626,00:36:33.58,00:36:33.58,And it's hard for me to bring upconversation with these women
627,00:36:36.75,00:36:36.75,that I feel I have nothing incommon with.
628,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,"You know, until you walk insomebody else's shoes, don't"

632,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,"Like, have you taken that time?>> No, I haven't."
633,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,I'll be honest with you.I haven't.
634,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,>> Do you realize thatright now is your opportunity

644,00:37:14.08,00:37:14.08,Give it a go.It feels nice to have someone
645,00:37:15.96,00:37:15.96,else French-braid your hair.>> I can try that.
646,00:37:19.38,00:37:19.38,We can start with the hair.That'd be working.
647,00:37:21.08,00:37:21.08,"Even do my nails, too, whileyou're at it, would you?"
648,00:37:24.21,00:37:24.21,"Yeah, that'd be great.That'd be great."

658,00:37:55.08,00:37:55.08,our fight today.And I think it was on both
659,00:37:57.46,00:37:57.46,"sides, so I don't see where I'mcausing emotional distress in"
