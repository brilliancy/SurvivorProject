4,00:00:06.17,00:00:06.17,forming. I think Lisa liked being in the
5,00:00:08.96,00:00:08.96,younger group and I think I gravitate more towards the older

18,00:00:44.79,00:00:44.79,somebody's nose into it. That was classless.
19,00:00:47.25,00:00:47.25,">> It was a game. I mean, we lost."

27,00:01:11.46,00:01:11.46,so she made deals to vote out both Eliza and Leann.

38,00:03:16.54,00:03:16.54,>> Dolly was totally blindsided at Tribal Council
39,00:03:20.04,00:03:20.04,tonight. She thought she was the one who
40,00:03:22.67,00:03:22.67,was the swing vote and she would be the one deciding who went
41,00:03:25.33,00:03:25.33,"home tonight, and, you know, that's not how the chips fell,"
42,00:03:29.08,00:03:29.08,so... >> How the hell did the
43,00:03:30.96,00:03:30.96,vote switch to Dolly? >> I think Mia and Julie
44,00:03:34.25,00:03:34.25,"and Lisa are a little upset with me right now, but I did what I"
45,00:03:37.21,00:03:37.21,had to do to make sure I was staying in this game.
46,00:03:39.33,00:03:39.33,I thought she was writing my name down tonight.
47,00:03:41.58,00:03:41.58,"She sat there and looked me in the eye and said, ""I'm going to"
48,00:03:43.67,00:03:43.67,"vote for a random person."" I... I couldn't get..."
49,00:03:47.21,00:03:47.21,">> Hey, how about clueing us in, Eliza?"
50,00:03:49.08,00:03:49.08,">> I know, but when was there time?"
51,00:03:50.79,00:03:50.79,It was like you guys knew... like you were off in the woods.
52,00:03:54.17,00:03:54.17,">> We thought Eliza was strong with us, but I guess she"
53,00:03:57.92,00:03:57.92,conspired with the other girls and decided to vote off Dolly
54,00:04:01.58,00:04:01.58,"without telling us. So, yeah, we don't trust Eliza."
55,00:04:04.54,00:04:04.54,So Lisa and Julie are the only girls I trust right now and I
56,00:04:08.21,00:04:08.21,guess we'll have to talk to Eliza tomorrow and see where her
57,00:04:11.12,00:04:11.12,"head was at on this, but we're all very shocked right now."
58,00:04:24.04,00:04:24.04,">> We'll stack them. You guys, like, free wrap it and"
59,00:04:26.62,00:04:26.62,stack it and free wrap it... and just keep crossing it so it
60,00:04:31.12,00:04:31.12,kind of binds as you go. >> Uh-oh. Too short?
61,00:04:35.92,00:04:35.92,>> Too short. >> Too short.
62,00:04:39.21,00:04:39.21,">> Hmm. Hey, where's Rory?"
63,00:04:44.96,00:04:44.96,Is he okay? >> Look at this!
64,00:04:52.58,00:04:52.58,Vitamin C! Mm.
65,00:05:03.29,00:05:03.29,">> Hey, here comes Rory. >> What's up?"
66,00:05:08.04,00:05:08.04,">> When it comes to Rory, the thing that really gets under"
67,00:05:11.29,00:05:11.29,"my skin is he doesn't do a lot of, you know, physical work."
68,00:05:15.88,00:05:15.88,He's not a team player. He's an individualist.
69,00:05:19.96,00:05:19.96,"But in a team, you can't be your own man all the time."
70,00:05:22.67,00:05:22.67,"It has to be about the team. Rory, I'm so used to supervising"
71,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,40 people. I see what everybody's doing.
72,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,I can't just sit here and do what Sarge is doing.
73,00:05:33.17,00:05:33.17,>> Do you feel I'm not pulling my weight?
74,00:05:34.92,00:05:34.92,>> I saw you go on a lot of walks.
75,00:05:37.17,00:05:37.17,>> This is why I go on all my walks.
76,00:05:40.21,00:05:40.21,>> Yeah. You found that? That's cool.
77,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,">> Sarge wants to dictate when people take a crap, when"
78,00:05:45.08,00:05:45.08,people take a bath. I'm a grown ass man and I don't
79,00:05:49.92,00:05:49.92,"take orders real well. Sarge, if you don't feel that"
80,00:05:52.96,00:05:52.96,"I'm pulling my weight, then you come to me and say, ""Rory, you"
81,00:05:55.46,00:05:55.46,"need to do a little more."" >> All I said was, ""What is"
82,00:05:57.62,00:05:57.62,"he doing?"" You know, ""people are really"
83,00:05:59.46,00:05:59.46,"working hard and he's going on walks."""
84,00:06:01.08,00:06:01.08,"I had to hold back a lot of comments and stuff, you know,"
85,00:06:03.79,00:06:03.79,like... >> And you think I haven't?
86,00:06:06.79,00:06:06.79,>> Rory has been very opinionated and he's been
87,00:06:08.71,00:06:08.71,isolating himself from the group.
88,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,Sarge is key in decision-making for the five guys.
89,00:06:13.75,00:06:13.75,">> I'm hoping he'll say, ""Hey, maybe we should take J.P."
90,00:06:16.96,00:06:16.96,because we're having too much conflict with one of the
91,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"guys in the main alliance."" >> Looks like it's going to"
92,00:06:50.62,00:06:50.62,be a sunny day today. We need to go on a serious food
93,00:06:53.88,00:06:53.88,hunt. You want to go hunting for food
94,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,"today? Like, I want to seriously go"
95,00:06:57.92,00:06:57.92,hunting for fruit. >> How are people complaining
96,00:07:10.12,00:07:10.12,"about people not doing work? Somebody may be starting a fire,"
97,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,but who's getting firewood? Somebody might be doing the
98,00:07:15.25,00:07:15.25,"shelter, but who's getting the palm fronds? So, I..."
99,00:07:18.42,00:07:18.42,">> No, honey. Just listen. >> Last night was ridiculous."
100,00:07:20.42,00:07:20.42,"> Am I on your side or what? >> Now, wait a minute."
101,00:07:23.21,00:07:23.21,"We've all asked you all... >> Twila, we've done a ton of"
102,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,work. >> I'm not saying you didn't.
103,00:07:28.38,00:07:28.38,>> You start a fire in the morning.
104,00:07:30.17,00:07:30.17,We could easily start that fire in the morning if you were not
105,00:07:32.17,00:07:32.17,"here. You played it up last night, and"
106,00:07:35.04,00:07:35.04,it's bull... It's the card that you're
107,00:07:37.54,00:07:37.54,"playing, and it's going to backfire."
108,00:07:40.46,00:07:40.46,>> I'm not saying that you all didn't do any work.
109,00:07:43.04,00:07:43.04,I said some do more than others. >> Because you play the martyr
110,00:07:46.79,00:07:46.79,and you take on that role. You take the martyr and you play
111,00:07:50.33,00:07:50.33,"on that role. If you were not here, we would"
112,00:07:53.08,00:07:53.08,still have fire and shelter and food.
113,00:07:55.71,00:07:55.71,That's it. >> You stay here five
114,00:07:58.67,00:07:58.67,"minutes, then your asses go down there in the ocean, so"
115,00:08:02.50,00:08:02.50,"don't give me no bull, bitch, because I will whip your butt."
116,00:08:05.08,00:08:05.08,>> It's your only card. Keep playing it.
117,00:08:08.38,00:08:08.38,Bitch. Twila and I were fighting about
118,00:08:11.79,00:08:11.79,"the fact that she threw us all under the bus last night, the"
119,00:08:14.29,00:08:14.29,"young'uns in the group, about being lazy."
120,00:08:17.88,00:08:17.88,We've all pulled our weight around here and I'm going to
121,00:08:20.21,00:08:20.21,"call her out as much as possible, because I can't stand"
122,00:08:23.12,00:08:23.12,"Twila-- I want her out. >> No, you didn't say that."
123,00:08:25.12,00:08:25.12,"You're lying. If it's the damn truth, it would"
124,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,"be different, but you're damn lying!"
125,00:08:28.71,00:08:28.71,">> Whatever, Twila. You play the martyr."
126,00:08:31.42,00:08:31.42,I don't care. We all do our ... around here.
127,00:08:34.25,00:08:34.25,">> I didn't say everybody... >> Yes, you did."
128,00:08:36.75,00:08:36.75,You called our asses out last night.
129,00:08:40.12,00:08:40.12,>> Mia's mad because she knows I was right.
130,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,Get off your ass and do something.
131,00:08:43.42,00:08:43.42,Quit sitting on the beach and going swimming when everybody
132,00:08:45.88,00:08:45.88,else's working. Who was swimming down there...
133,00:08:49.12,00:08:49.12,">> Twila, because we were swimming for ten minutes?"
134,00:08:51.25,00:08:51.25,Who built this shelter? Who got all the bamboo and the
135,00:08:54.21,00:08:54.21,palm fronds? >> You honestly haven't seen...
136,00:08:56.04,00:08:56.04,>> Don't think you're going to sit there and talk about me
137,00:08:58.04,00:08:58.04,"and then today it's going to be nice and lovey-dovey and kissy,"
138,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,because you want to be fake. >> I'm not going to sit
139,00:09:05.62,00:09:05.62,"there and argue with her because she's mad, but I ain't taking"
140,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,"her crap, I'll tell you that. I'll whip the little scrawny"
141,00:09:11.21,00:09:11.21,bitch's ass because I don't care.
142,00:09:13.46,00:09:13.46,I ain't in it here to make no friends.
143,00:09:29.25,00:09:29.25,">> So, what's up with you now? Because everyone thinks you're"
144,00:09:32.25,00:09:32.25,"sketchy. >> I feel like I am sketchy, but"
145,00:09:34.21,00:09:34.21,I didn't ever make an alliance with them.
146,00:09:35.67,00:09:35.67,"I just said, ""This time, we've got to get rid of Dolly."""
147,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,">> Okay, so there isn't like a permanent thing going on?"
148,00:09:40.75,00:09:40.75,">> No, no, no. Julie and I went to get tree"
149,00:09:42.62,00:09:42.62,"mail and Julie was like, ""Eliza, are you still with us?"""
150,00:09:46.88,00:09:46.88,"And I was like, ""I did what I needed to do because, you know,"
151,00:09:49.25,00:09:49.25,I didn't trust Dolly and I thought that she was going to
152,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,"vote for me."" >> Tree mail!"
153,00:09:55.46,00:09:55.46,">> Oh, hey, you two. Just the people we want to see."
154,00:09:59.12,00:09:59.12,">> Mia and Lisa walk up to meet Julie and I, who are"
155,00:10:02.79,00:10:02.79,coming back from getting tree mail.
156,00:10:04.46,00:10:04.46,I'm with you 100%. >> Okay.
157,00:10:06.04,00:10:06.04,">> I was like, ""I'm with you guys 100%."""
158,00:10:08.17,00:10:08.17,>> Let's get rid of Twila. I can't stand that bitch
159,00:10:11.04,00:10:11.04,anymore. I'm about to bust ass.
160,00:10:13.54,00:10:13.54,"Dude, Eliza, don't switch. >> Please."
161,00:10:16.21,00:10:16.21,Please. >> As long as the four of
162,00:10:19.00,00:10:19.00,"us are still strong, we'll pull somebody else in."
163,00:10:21.25,00:10:21.25,">> Well, I'm not so sure that Eliza is in with us."
164,00:10:26.83,00:10:26.83,"Even then, I don't know if I trust her."
165,00:10:29.54,00:10:29.54,"But I've got a backup plan, so we'll see what happens."
166,00:10:35.08,00:10:35.08,">> Okay, ready? ""This next challenge is a tough"
167,00:10:37.46,00:10:37.46,one. Both tribes should feel quite
168,00:10:39.33,00:10:39.33,stressed. The island's aura darkens.
169,00:10:42.12,00:10:42.12,"Today, all friendships will be put to the test."
170,00:10:45.17,00:10:45.17,A long day and night for everyone.
171,00:10:47.12,00:10:47.12,"Yes, there is need to worry."" >> Oh, no!"
172,00:10:48.58,00:10:48.58,">> ""With immunity on the line, you better finish in a"

174,00:10:52.00,00:10:52.00,">> Immunity, again? Back-to-back ones?"
175,00:10:54.92,00:10:54.92,>> We went to Tribal Council last night and we have tree mail
176,00:10:58.21,00:10:58.21,talking about immunity. And that bites because yesterday
177,00:11:04.54,00:11:04.54,sucked big time and I don't want to go through it again two days
178,00:11:07.21,00:11:07.21,"in a row. >> PROBST: What's up, guys?"
179,00:11:19.50,00:11:19.50,"You look good. >> Feel good, Jeff."

185,00:11:39.04,00:11:39.04,">> PROBST: All right, first things first."
186,00:11:41.21,00:11:41.21,"Chad, take back immunity. Immunity back up for grabs."

377,00:21:27.62,00:21:27.62,">> Okay, okay, okay. I didn't want John thinking that"
378,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,"this was some five-person alliance, because that's"
379,00:21:33.04,00:21:33.04,definitely not what it was. I felt like I needed to explain
380,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,to him that it was because my head was on the chopping block.
381,00:21:39.38,00:21:39.38,"I go, ""Dolly, look me in the eye and tell me you're not writing"
382,00:21:41.29,00:21:41.29,"my name down."" She's like, ""I don't know."
383,00:21:42.62,00:21:42.62,I don't want to vote with either side.
384,00:21:43.88,00:21:43.88,"I'm just going to vote for someone random."""
385,00:21:45.25,00:21:45.25,"And I go, ""Oh, she's voting against me."""
386,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,"And then, it was like... >> She was trying to play both"
387,00:21:48.12,00:21:48.12,"sides. >> Yeah, she was."
388,00:21:49.38,00:21:49.38,>> It was a few... >> JOHN: And she got caught.
389,00:21:51.29,00:21:51.29,>> Yeah. >> It was a few hours
390,00:21:52.96,00:21:52.96,before Tribal Council and Dolly goes...
391,00:21:54.29,00:21:54.29,">> That's all I need to know, yeah."
392,00:21:55.88,00:21:55.88,>> I'm just going to go talk to them.
393,00:21:57.50,00:21:57.50,>> She went up there and she goes...
394,00:21:59.08,00:21:59.08,>> I'm just going to go talk to them.
395,00:22:00.33,00:22:00.33,">> There's no way he's giving her immunity, you know?"
396,00:22:02.33,00:22:02.33,>> He's not going to give any of them immunity.
397,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,">> Unless he wants to... >> Good, Eliza, keep"
398,00:22:06.25,00:22:06.25,"talking. Dig yourself in a hole, Eliza."
399,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,"Stupid. >> Yeah, and she won't let"
400,00:22:08.96,00:22:08.96,"anybody else talk. >> I know, please."
401,00:22:10.25,00:22:10.25,">> Yesterday, after we lost the immunity challenge, if"
402,00:22:12.42,00:22:12.42,"you would have looked at me, I was crying."
403,00:22:14.12,00:22:14.12,"It was so sad. Like, we all get along so well."
404,00:22:16.92,00:22:16.92,"Like, really, it's been amazing. >> Mm-hmm."
405,00:22:18.92,00:22:18.92,Eliza just didn't stop talking. She just kept talking and
406,00:22:21.21,00:22:21.21,"talking and talking. I mean, she seems really sweet."
407,00:22:23.25,00:22:23.25,"I'm sure she's really nice, but the bottom line is, ""Oh, my God,"
408,00:22:25.62,00:22:25.62,"would you please stop talking?"" Hi, I'm John."
409,00:22:29.12,00:22:29.12,>> Mia. >> JOHN: Nice to meet you.
410,00:22:30.88,00:22:30.88,>> I'm Lisa. >> Julie.
411,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,">> JOHN: Nice to meet you. All right, here's my question:"
412,00:22:34.42,00:22:34.42,"flat out, who do you guys think you need to get off?"
413,00:22:36.04,00:22:36.04,">> Just don't give it to Twila, please."
414,00:22:37.46,00:22:37.46,">> JOHN: No, I won't give it to Twila."
415,00:22:38.75,00:22:38.75,>> Please. >> Or Eliza.
416,00:22:43.17,00:22:43.17,>> JOHN: The girls told me not to give the immunity necklace to
417,00:22:46.00,00:22:46.00,"Eliza and Twila, but I could care less who gets voted off of"
418,00:22:49.29,00:22:49.29,this tribe. I just want them to not be mad
419,00:22:51.75,00:22:51.75,"at me for whoever gets voted off, because I might merge with"
420,00:22:54.38,00:22:54.38,them and it would be nice to have them on my side later on.
421,00:22:57.46,00:22:57.46,>> Here she comes. She's going to work us now.
422,00:23:00.04,00:23:00.04,">> Oh, no, tell her to go away. Whoa, this is our time."
423,00:23:02.67,00:23:02.67,>> Have you guys found any grubs?
424,00:23:04.46,00:23:04.46,">> No. >> So, what's up with you?"
425,00:23:08.12,00:23:08.12,">> Yeah, dude, what's up? Teetering?"
426,00:23:10.04,00:23:10.04,>> I am not teetering. >> You're not voting for me
427,00:23:12.75,00:23:12.75,tonight. >> No way in hell.
428,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,Scout is a detriment in challenges.
429,00:23:16.42,00:23:16.42,>> I don't want to vote for Scout.
430,00:23:18.00,00:23:18.00,>> She thinks we can't... >> I don't want to vote
431,00:23:20.12,00:23:20.12,for Scout. >> I do.
432,00:23:21.08,00:23:21.08,>> I don't. >> I do.
433,00:23:22.38,00:23:22.38,If it goes five-three? >> I would rather vote for
434,00:23:24.42,00:23:24.42,Twila than Scout. >> Then it would be a tie for
435,00:23:26.25,00:23:26.25,me. >> I don't know what's
436,00:23:27.79,00:23:27.79,"going on with them, I just know they are not too happy with each"
437,00:23:30.00,00:23:30.00,"other. To see some conflict like that,"
438,00:23:31.54,00:23:31.54,it's going to fun to pick a girl to not get voted off.
439,00:23:35.71,00:23:35.71,">> You just keep saying you don't want there to be a tie,"
440,00:23:37.88,00:23:37.88,well... >> I know...
441,00:23:39.04,00:23:39.04,"Honestly, I don't trust you, Eliza."
442,00:23:40.58,00:23:40.58,">> Shh, let's not do this right now."
443,00:23:42.54,00:23:42.54,">> Fine, don't trust me. Fine, fine, because I'm going to"
444,00:23:44.21,00:23:44.21,be the first one out anyhow. You've been mad at me since I
445,00:23:48.50,00:23:48.50,"voted for Dolly and I understand why, but, like..."
446,00:23:51.50,00:23:51.50,">> I'm over it. >> Me, too."
447,00:23:53.17,00:23:53.17,>> I just want to know what's up tonight.
448,00:23:54.33,00:23:54.33,">> Eliza, if we can get rid of one of them tonight, it's us"
449,00:23:56.67,00:23:56.67,"four strong again, and they're out."
450,00:23:59.71,00:23:59.71,"Eliza seems to be teetering a little bit, but tonight at"
451,00:24:02.04,00:24:02.04,Tribal Council I'm almost positive it's going to be a tie.
452,00:24:05.25,00:24:05.25,"I mean, me and Twila had one of our famous fights this morning,"
453,00:24:08.04,00:24:08.04,so I think that me and Julie and Lisa and Eliza are going to be
454,00:24:12.04,00:24:12.04,"voting for Twila, and I'm pretty sure that Leann and Ami and"
455,00:24:15.83,00:24:15.83,Twila and Scout will be voting for me tonight.
456,00:24:18.42,00:24:18.42,"But, there's still individual immunity to be given out, too,"
457,00:24:21.25,00:24:21.25,so I don't know what's going to happen.
458,00:24:28.25,00:24:28.25,">> Man, we kicked ass on those rings, didn't we?"
459,00:24:31.46,00:24:31.46,"Man, oh, man. We won the reward challenge."
460,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,"It was a great feeling. And then, after that, we ran"
461,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,"into the immunity challenge. Out of most of the other guys, I"
462,00:24:43.96,00:24:43.96,"needed it the most, so I think that I'm going to be quite"
463,00:24:47.00,00:24:47.00,vulnerable tonight. I would actually like to use the
464,00:24:49.42,00:24:49.42,"term ""dead man walking."" Brady's in the same boat."
465,00:24:52.79,00:24:52.79,We're the youngest guys there. We're the strongest there.
466,00:24:55.04,00:24:55.04,"And right now, it's five against three."
467,00:25:11.50,00:25:11.50,"We've got to plant the seed in Sarge's head, saying, ""Sarge,"
468,00:25:14.50,00:25:14.50,"ally with us or think about getting rid of Rory,"" because"
469,00:25:19.67,00:25:19.67,the Sarge and Rory are the last few days have been having some
470,00:25:22.71,00:25:22.71,conflict. What about this idea of after
471,00:25:29.08,00:25:29.08,the merge? You need the group of guys that
472,00:25:32.96,00:25:32.96,"you think, if they hang together, will be the last"
473,00:25:35.33,00:25:35.33,people in the game. >> Right.
474,00:25:37.21,00:25:37.21,">> If one of the four of us can win most of the challenges, we"
475,00:25:40.04,00:25:40.04,just look out for each other and we make sure we're the last
476,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,four. >> It's possible.
477,00:25:43.25,00:25:43.25,It's possible. >> It's simple.
478,00:25:46.75,00:25:46.75,It's not underhanded. And we know our four votes are
479,00:25:50.08,00:25:50.08,going in one direction. >> I don't know.
480,00:26:03.04,00:26:03.04,"I got a real bad feeling about one of our pact, man."
481,00:26:06.42,00:26:06.42,He's just got a sorry attitude. >> You don't have to
482,00:26:09.46,00:26:09.46,"worry about no one in our pact, I guarantee you that."
483,00:26:11.21,00:26:11.21,">> No, I ain't... I'm not worried about that."
484,00:26:12.96,00:26:12.96,I have trouble working next to him and being around him right
485,00:26:15.92,00:26:15.92,now. >> Rory?
486,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,>> Yeah! I'm like...
487,00:26:19.25,00:26:19.25,"I mean... >> Dude, I understand"
488,00:26:20.92,00:26:20.92,"what you're saying, and we'll deal with it, but this just"
489,00:26:23.25,00:26:23.25,isn't the time. >> I hate Tribal Council.
490,00:26:37.21,00:26:37.21,"I hate building a team of men or survivors, building them up to a"
491,00:26:42.08,00:26:42.08,fine-tuned team and then tearing them down.
492,00:26:44.67,00:26:44.67,"That's not me. But I'm playing this game, and"
493,00:26:48.33,00:26:48.33,during this game I have to do that.
494,00:27:19.92,00:27:19.92,>> PROBST: Bring in John. He spent the afternoon over at
495,00:27:22.50,00:27:22.50,the Yasur camp. I'm sure you had an interesting
496,00:27:30.08,00:27:30.08,"afternoon. >> Yes, I did."
497,00:27:31.50,00:27:31.50,>> PROBST: We'll get to that in a minute.
498,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,"First, though, I want to talk about the tribe."
499,00:27:35.21,00:27:35.21,"Chad, how have you seen this tribe change and grow?"
500,00:27:39.04,00:27:39.04,">> We've had camaraderie since the very get-go, and I"
501,00:27:42.71,00:27:42.71,think that we've gained a lot of confidence by winning some of
502,00:27:47.08,00:27:47.08,"the challenges, and that's brought us closer together."
503,00:27:50.88,00:27:50.88,">> PROBST: Brady, any first impressions here that have"
504,00:27:53.21,00:27:53.21,changed? >> I don't know if it's
505,00:27:55.38,00:27:55.38,"better or worse, but I certainly had a different impression of"
506,00:27:57.54,00:27:57.54,"Sarge. Sarge is kind of a loud, booming"
507,00:28:01.17,00:28:01.17,"personality, but Sarge is a much more personable guy than most"
508,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,people would probably give him credit for and that most people
509,00:28:08.12,00:28:08.12,"see. >> PROBST: So, John, while these"
510,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,"guys are back at camp, you're over with the women."
511,00:28:13.92,00:28:13.92,How aggressive were the women in terms of working you for that
512,00:28:17.62,00:28:17.62,"thing around your neck, immunity?"
513,00:28:19.33,00:28:19.33,">> You know what, as soon as I went in there, I said,"
514,00:28:21.38,00:28:21.38,"""people who voted for Dolly,"" I said, ""go over there."
515,00:28:24.46,00:28:24.46,"People who didn't vote for Dolly, go over there."""
516,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,"And as soon as I divided them, I figured out what their alliances"
517,00:28:29.08,00:28:29.08,"were, and it was really easy after I divided them."
518,00:28:31.83,00:28:31.83,>> Good job. >> Oh!
519,00:28:34.29,00:28:34.29,>> PROBST: Who knew young John was this bright?
520,00:28:36.67,00:28:36.67,>> Good job! >> PROBST: So you feel very
521,00:28:39.33,00:28:39.33,confident in the decision you're making?
522,00:28:41.54,00:28:41.54,">> I feel 150% confident. >> PROBST: Now, let's get to"
523,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,"this vote. J. P, what are you basing your"
524,00:28:48.46,00:28:48.46,vote on? >> I think you want
525,00:28:49.75,00:28:49.75,this group as strong as possible going into that next challenge.
526,00:28:52.67,00:28:52.67,"Who are those individuals that have the particular strengths,"
527,00:28:55.21,00:28:55.21,"the skill-sets, the mesh, the personality that can move"
528,00:28:57.46,00:28:57.46,forward and prepare for that merge?
529,00:29:00.29,00:29:00.29,">> PROBST: Sarge, tough vote for you, or is this easy because"
530,00:29:02.71,00:29:02.71,friendship isn't part of this game?
531,00:29:05.12,00:29:05.12,>> Friendships... I have
532,00:29:06.08,00:29:06.08,"friendships here, but I'm here to play a game."
533,00:29:09.29,00:29:09.29,The person going home tonight is a casualty of war.
534,00:29:12.00,00:29:12.00,">> PROBST: Okay, it's time to vote."
535,00:29:13.54,00:29:13.54,"John, you're wearing the immunity necklace."
536,00:29:16.04,00:29:16.04,You're the only person safe. Everybody else is fair game.
537,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,"John, you're up first. >> I'm voting for you."
538,00:29:33.54,00:29:33.54,"I might be weaker than you physically, but I'm stronger"
539,00:29:35.58,00:29:35.58,than you mentally. It's just a game.
540,00:29:46.12,00:29:46.12,">> Ain't nothing personal, man. I'm just being consistent."
541,00:29:57.62,00:29:57.62,>> I'm voting for Rory tonight because you are the
542,00:30:01.12,00:30:01.12,"weakest guy in the tribe. Hopefully, there will be four"
543,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,votes to get you out. Or tie with me.
544,00:30:18.21,00:30:18.21,">> This is our strategy. Sorry, my friend."
545,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
546,00:30:57.21,00:30:57.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
547,00:30:59.67,00:30:59.67,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
548,00:31:01.25,00:31:01.25,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
549,00:31:04.38,00:31:04.38,First vote: Rory. J. P.
550,00:31:12.04,00:31:12.04,J. P. That's two votes J.P.
551,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,Rory. Two votes Rory; two votes J.P.
552,00:31:28.08,00:31:28.08,Rory. Three votes Rory; two votes
553,00:31:31.75,00:31:31.75,J.P. Tied.
554,00:31:37.08,00:31:37.08,Three votes J P. Three votes Rory.
555,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,Four votes J.P. Three votes Rory.
556,00:31:47.17,00:31:47.17,Last vote. Third person voted out of
557,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,"Survivor: Vanuatu, J.P. Please bring me your torch."
558,00:32:07.12,00:32:07.12,"J. P., the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
559,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,"Well, both times, you guys have been to Tribal Council, the"
560,00:32:31.83,00:32:31.83,consensus has been that the vote was based on keeping the tribe
561,00:32:34.83,00:32:34.83,strong. You voted out two of your
562,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,strongest members. Interesting strategy.
563,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,"See if it works. John, you'll stay behind for the"
564,00:32:41.58,00:32:41.58,next Tribal Council. The rest of you guys take your
565,00:32:43.75,00:32:43.75,torches with you back to camp. Good night.
566,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,">> Well, what can I say? I survived seven days."
567,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"I was hoping to stay a little bit longer, but there's no way"
568,00:32:57.12,00:32:57.12,"that I think I was outwitted, outlasted, outplayed."
569,00:33:01.62,00:33:01.62,Coming to the island and being part of something that I
570,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,"couldn't even imagine, I'll tell you, what an experience."
571,00:33:28.54,00:33:28.54,>> PROBST: Welcome back to Tribal Council.
572,00:33:30.92,00:33:30.92,Lopevi has already voted somebody out.
573,00:33:33.08,00:33:33.08,"John is staying behind because, as you know, he's going to award"
574,00:33:35.38,00:33:35.38,one of you his immunity necklace which will make you safe from
575,00:33:38.88,00:33:38.88,the vote tonight. You know who you're going to
576,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,give it to? >> Yeah.
577,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,">> PROBST: So, Yasur, one of you is about to become immune from"
578,00:34:00.12,00:34:00.12,"the vote. John, give it up."
579,00:34:18.04,00:34:18.04,"Why Ami? >> Because, out of"
580,00:34:21.29,00:34:21.29,"everyone there, she was not getting voted off tonight no"
581,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,matter what-- and I think you guys need to figure out who you
582,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,"want to vote out. And because I picked her, it's"
583,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,"probably going to be who it was going to be anyway, and you'll"
584,00:34:33.54,00:34:33.54,"figure out a lot about your own tribe, because you guys are two"
585,00:34:36.08,00:34:36.08,sides. Grab your torch...
586,00:34:38.75,00:34:38.75,">> Take it easy, guys. >> PROBST: ... find the rest of"
587,00:34:41.62,00:34:41.62,"your tribe. >> Bye, John."
588,00:34:43.12,00:34:43.12,">> Bye, John. >> PROBST: Good night."
589,00:34:50.58,00:34:50.58,"Ami, surprised? >> A little surprised, yeah."
590,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,I thought that he would put it on someone's head that he
591,00:34:57.42,00:34:57.42,thought might get voted out tonight.
592,00:34:59.29,00:34:59.29,">> PROBST: Scout, you leave here after a very surprising vote to"
593,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,a lot of people. You go back to camp.
594,00:35:08.29,00:35:08.29,"It's a tough night. You get up in the morning, and"
595,00:35:10.25,00:35:10.25,what happens? >> It was obvious that
596,00:35:12.62,00:35:12.62,"Mia was a little pissed off at the vote, didn't understand it."
597,00:35:15.46,00:35:15.46,"This morning, when they got up, Twila and Mia really got into"
598,00:35:18.42,00:35:18.42,"it. >> PROBST: Mia, what's your"
599,00:35:20.29,00:35:20.29,take? >> It had nothing really to
600,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,do about the vote. It just had to do about Twila's
601,00:35:24.58,00:35:24.58,"comments about the young ones not doing anything, not pulling"
602,00:35:28.17,00:35:28.17,"their weight. And it really did upset me, so I"
603,00:35:31.08,00:35:31.08,confronted her about it this morning.
604,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,">> PROBST: Twila, did you make a comment about workload?"
605,00:35:36.21,00:35:36.21,>> She was offended by what I said last night at Tribal
606,00:35:39.96,00:35:39.96,Council. I don't know why I offended her
607,00:35:42.38,00:35:42.38,"so bad, but I just said what I felt."
608,00:35:45.25,00:35:45.25,I felt like I was telling the truth.
609,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,">> PROBST: Julie, what's the result of that?"
610,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,>> I think it goes a little deeper than the comment.
611,00:35:52.04,00:35:52.04,"Speaking for myself, I haven't felt like Twila's made any"
612,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,"effort to communicate or build anything with me, so, you know,"
613,00:36:00.12,00:36:00.12,"without that bridge, it's frustrating, and I think Mia got"
614,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,frustrated. >> They haven't given me
615,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"an opportunity to talk to them. I mean, why would I want to walk"
616,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,up to somebody that rolls their eyes at me all the time and acts
617,00:36:11.04,00:36:11.04,like they can't stand to be around me?
618,00:36:12.71,00:36:12.71,"Why would I even want to try? >> Twila, you talk to me in"
619,00:36:14.96,00:36:14.96,one-word answers. I'm not going to try to pull a
620,00:36:17.08,00:36:17.08,conversation out of you. >> That's just my
621,00:36:18.38,00:36:18.38,"personality, and that's just how I am."
622,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,>> You have plenty of conversations with everybody
623,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,else except for a couple of us. >> I just communicate
624,00:36:24.88,00:36:24.88,"better with men than I do women. I always have, always will."
625,00:36:28.83,00:36:28.83,I am the tomboy. I do weld.
626,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,I do fix trucks. I do those things.
627,00:36:33.58,00:36:33.58,And it's hard for me to bring up conversation with these women
628,00:36:36.75,00:36:36.75,that I feel I have nothing in common with.
629,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,"You know, until you walk in somebody else's shoes, don't"
630,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,judge. >> Have you taken the time
631,00:36:42.79,00:36:42.79,to walk in these girls' shoes and realize they're just girls?
632,00:36:45.29,00:36:45.29,They like to play on the beach. They like to do girly stuff.
633,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,"Like, have you taken that time? >> No, I haven't."
634,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,I'll be honest with you. I haven't.
635,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,>> Do you realize that right now is your opportunity
636,00:36:54.79,00:36:54.79,"to, like, find the feminine side of you and just let go of ""this"
637,00:36:57.25,00:36:57.25,"is what I am"" and realize there's so much more to you than"
638,00:37:00.79,00:37:00.79,"just that? There is a wonderful,"
639,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,feminine... >> Maybe I don't have a
640,00:37:04.88,00:37:04.88,"feminine side to me, I don't know."
641,00:37:06.04,00:37:06.04,">> Yes, you do.  Just say, ""you know what?"
642,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,Will you guys French-braid my hair tomorrow?
643,00:37:09.75,00:37:09.75,"Will one of you French..."" you know?"
644,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,"Something silly like that. I know, it sounds crazy."
645,00:37:14.08,00:37:14.08,Give it a go. It feels nice to have someone
646,00:37:15.96,00:37:15.96,else French-braid your hair. >> I can try that.
647,00:37:19.38,00:37:19.38,We can start with the hair. That'd be working.
648,00:37:21.08,00:37:21.08,"Even do my nails, too, while you're at it, would you?"
649,00:37:24.21,00:37:24.21,"Yeah, that'd be great. That'd be great."
650,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,">> PROBST: Scout, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
651,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,">> Maintaining a healthy, emotional attitude in camp."
652,00:37:37.25,00:37:37.25,>> PROBST: Your vote tonight is to get rid of somebody that you
653,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,"think is causing disharmony, chaos, problems."
654,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,">> Yeah, chaos, agitation, disharmony, yeah."
655,00:37:44.88,00:37:44.88,">> PROBST: Mia, you're shaking your head, rolling your eyes,"
656,00:37:47.25,00:37:47.25,closing your eyes. You're like the little doggie in
657,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,the window. >> I feel like Scout's
658,00:37:51.92,00:37:51.92,statement is definitely pointed toward me and the disharmony was
659,00:37:55.08,00:37:55.08,our fight today. And I think it was on both
660,00:37:57.46,00:37:57.46,"sides, so I don't see where I'm causing emotional distress in"
661,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,"the tribe at all. >> PROBST: Eliza, decided who"
662,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,you're voting for? >> I think Scout's
663,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,"statement about disharmony is a good one, but if I had the"
664,00:38:09.92,00:38:09.92,choice to keep everyone here I definitely would.
665,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,">> PROBST: With that, it is time to vote."
666,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,Ami is the only person you cannot vote for.
667,00:38:16.62,00:38:16.62,"Everybody else is fair game. Mia, you're up."
668,00:38:27.83,00:38:27.83,">> Twila, I'm voting for you. You said you can't relate to"
669,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,"women, and, unfortunately, you got stuck on an all women's"
670,00:38:33.46,00:38:33.46,tribe. I don't want to spend another
671,00:38:35.12,00:38:35.12,"day on the island with you. >> Mia, your volcano"
672,00:38:46.54,00:38:46.54,erupts more than I like. Good luck in finding a husband
673,00:38:50.88,00:38:50.88,that will put up with you. >> I think you're a young
674,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,woman that's got a big chip on her shoulder.
675,00:39:08.71,00:39:08.71,I think that you got a mouth- and-a-half and I think you need
676,00:39:11.29,00:39:11.29,to go. That's all.
677,00:39:21.92,00:39:21.92,">> Twila, my vote's for you. I think you have an amazing work"
678,00:39:25.38,00:39:25.38,"ethic, but you can't be here anymore."
679,00:39:29.00,00:39:29.00,Sorry. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
680,00:39:35.42,00:39:35.42,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
681,00:39:48.96,00:39:48.96,decision is final. The person voted out will be
682,00:39:51.08,00:39:51.08,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
683,00:39:53.08,00:39:53.08,I'll read the votes. First vote: Twila.
684,00:40:01.25,00:40:01.25,Mia. One vote Twila; one vote Mia.
685,00:40:06.92,00:40:06.92,Twila. Two votes Twila; one vote Mia.
686,00:40:13.17,00:40:13.17,Mia. Two votes Mia; two votes Twila.
687,00:40:20.38,00:40:20.38,Mia. That's three votes Mia; two
688,00:40:23.17,00:40:23.17,votes Twila. Twila.
689,00:40:28.88,00:40:28.88,You're tied. Three votes Twila; three votes
690,00:40:34.29,00:40:34.29,Mia. That's four votes Mia; three
691,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,votes Twila. One vote left.
692,00:40:43.46,00:40:43.46,"The fourth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu, Mia."
693,00:40:49.12,00:40:49.12,"Bring me your torch. Mia, the tribe has spoken."
694,00:41:02.42,00:41:02.42,">> Thanks. Kick ass, ladies."
695,00:41:05.08,00:41:05.08,">> Bye, Mia. >> PROBST: Well, if there was"

698,00:41:27.75,00:41:27.75,emotional harmony. The question is: did tonight's
699,00:41:30.21,00:41:30.21,"vote bring you any closer? Ami, you can leave that necklace"
700,00:41:33.12,00:41:33.12,behind. Grab your torches.
