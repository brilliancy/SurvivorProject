1,00:00:01.73,00:00:01.73,   ANNOUNCER: Last week on Survivor:
2,00:00:04.43,00:00:04.43,  Rich woke up with  a Tribal Council hangover...
3,00:00:07.00,00:00:07.00,I got bombarded at the council.
4,00:00:08.50,00:00:08.50, A little alliance tried
5,00:00:09.97,00:00:09.97,  to attack Richie    on my birthday.
6,00:00:11.93,00:00:11.93,   ANNOUNCER:  So he decided to fight back by catching fewer fish.
7,00:00:14.70,00:00:14.70,"And I'm, like, you backstabbers,  Colleen and Gervase."
8,00:00:16.93,00:00:16.93,"First, you want him out of here"
9,00:00:18.77,00:00:18.77, and then you're   all over the food.
10,00:00:21.80,00:00:21.80, Uh...
11,00:00:24.27,00:00:24.27,   ANNOUNCER: But Sue did some backstabbing  on her own...
12,00:00:27.87,00:00:27.87, I never trusted Rich.
13,00:00:29.07,00:00:29.07, He's a snake.
14,00:00:31.33,00:00:31.33,   ANNOUNCER:  And cracks appeared    in the alliance.
15,00:00:32.97,00:00:32.97,   Making a deal with Rich is
16,00:00:34.27,00:00:34.27, kind of like  making a deal with the devil.
17,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,   ANNOUNCER: But it was Rich  who burned the competition...
18,00:00:40.60,00:00:40.60,Yeah!
19,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53,"   ANNOUNCER: And won the big prize,    immunity."
20,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77," Unable to vote for Rich at the council,"
21,00:00:48.40,00:00:48.40,  Sue and Kelly stuck    with the alliance
22,00:00:50.70,00:00:50.70,  and sent Gervase packing.
23,00:00:52.37,00:00:52.37,  JEFF PROBST:Gervase.
24,00:00:54.10,00:00:54.10,   ANNOUNCER:  Only six remain.
25,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83, Who will be voted off tonight?

28,00:02:15.00,00:02:15.00, RICH: Just woke up.
29,00:02:18.20,00:02:18.20,  I'm wet.
30,00:02:19.63,00:02:19.63," So, I guess it rained   last night,"
31,00:02:21.70,00:02:21.70, but I slept through it.
32,00:02:23.27,00:02:23.27,  Today is the... 31st day...
33,00:02:25.27,00:02:25.27,I think.
34,00:02:26.77,00:02:26.77," All I know is, this is  the ninth day till the end."
35,00:02:30.33,00:02:30.33, KELLY: People were kind of miserable  this morning.
36,00:02:33.77,00:02:33.77,  I was one of the miserable.
37,00:02:36.33,00:02:36.33,"  I mean, every day's    a little tough because..."
38,00:02:39.93,00:02:39.93,   we don't have a lot to do  and we're-we're low energy.
39,00:02:42.90,00:02:42.90," Rich has gotten really,   really weak"
40,00:02:46.47,00:02:46.47,  and really crabby    and really hungry
41,00:02:49.57,00:02:49.57,  an-and Sean also.
42,00:02:51.33,00:02:51.33,  I got to try to put on some weight
43,00:02:52.60,00:02:52.60,   before I go home.
44,00:02:53.90,00:02:53.90,  Everyone's telling  me I look ugly.
45,00:02:55.33,00:02:55.33,"  The food I miss, but not as much as my parents."
46,00:02:57.33,00:02:57.33," The hardest part, uh, for me,  about being here, um"
47,00:03:00.13,00:03:00.13,is that I miss my family
48,00:03:01.57,00:03:01.57,"and, uh... like I've reiterated a thousand times over"
49,00:03:04.70,00:03:04.70,"  I'm no mama's boy,  but I'd really like"
50,00:03:06.70,00:03:06.70,  to see my family.
51,00:03:08.10,00:03:08.10, It would mean    an enormous amount to me.
52,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13, When you think of their smiles
53,00:03:11.57,00:03:11.57," and their hugs  and stuff like that,"
54,00:03:12.93,00:03:12.93, I just can't wait to see them.
55,00:03:14.73,00:03:14.73,  ( birds squawking )
56,00:03:24.13,00:03:24.13, KELLY:  Colleen's legs are pretty beat up.
57,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23, She's gotten some pretty bad gashes
58,00:03:28.23,00:03:28.23, and she has some sores up higher on her legs
59,00:03:30.53,00:03:30.53, that she doesn't know  how she got.
60,00:03:36.77,00:03:36.77,COLLEEN:  My legs are bothering me.
61,00:03:39.20,00:03:39.20,"  I mean, I would be lying"
62,00:03:41.33,00:03:41.33,   if I said my legs  aren't bothering me.
63,00:03:44.20,00:03:44.20, They-they hurt a lot.
64,00:03:46.07,00:03:46.07,I have all these
65,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,"and then, I have these new ones."
66,00:03:49.87,00:03:49.87, I can't sleep   because they itch so bad.
67,00:03:52.27,00:03:52.27,"So, I get a scar and then I itch it off"
68,00:03:54.77,00:03:54.77,  and it... and it's just likethis never-ending cycle
69,00:03:57.40,00:03:57.40,   and they're goingto be like this
70,00:03:59.07,00:03:59.07,"   for the next three years,   you know?"
71,00:04:00.57,00:04:00.57, And bugs live in them.
72,00:04:02.03,00:04:02.03,"I mean, it's just awful."
73,00:04:03.63,00:04:03.63, It's so awful.
74,00:04:06.77,00:04:06.77,"  I am feeling likeI've been here for 59,000 days."
75,00:04:11.10,00:04:11.10,  The past five days have been
76,00:04:13.50,00:04:13.50, the longest five days   of my entire life.
77,00:04:16.47,00:04:16.47,  I miss my old team.
78,00:04:19.20,00:04:19.20,  ♪ ♪
79,00:04:24.67,00:04:24.67," I miss my old beach, you know?"
80,00:04:27.37,00:04:27.37,  I am the last sole survivor  of the Pagong Tribe.
81,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,  I am a dying breed.
82,00:04:32.77,00:04:32.77, Pagong gets picked off   one by one.
83,00:04:34.97,00:04:34.97, That's obvious.
84,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50," Now, I'm very confused   at where alliances stand,"
85,00:04:39.03,00:04:39.03,  and I think they're confused   at where alliances stand.
86,00:04:42.00,00:04:42.00, RICH:Try and follow all this.
87,00:04:43.80,00:04:43.80, I'm going to give you all of what's happened.
88,00:04:45.87,00:04:45.87,COLLEEN:  Rich and Sue are promising  one thing to Sean...
89,00:04:48.50,00:04:48.50, promising another thing    to Kelly.
90,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,  Sue and Kelly are promising  one thing to Rich...
91,00:04:53.37,00:04:53.37,"npromising another thing toSean,"
92,00:04:55.13,00:04:55.13," and then, Rudy just sits back"
93,00:04:57.23,00:04:57.23,  and watch it all happen.
94,00:04:58.97,00:04:58.97, RICH:  It seems like Kelly might be flip-flopping
95,00:05:01.87,00:05:01.87, and planning strategies at our expense
96,00:05:05.03,00:05:05.03,  and that just ticked Sue off   to no end.
97,00:05:07.27,00:05:07.27,"Kelly is staying in the alliance at this time,"
98,00:05:09.53,00:05:09.53,but she's trying   to make herself look good
99,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,   to the other team
100,00:05:12.93,00:05:12.93,"  in case it comes    down to the end,"
101,00:05:14.33,00:05:14.33,  and she's  one of the last two standing
102,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17," that she will be, like,""Oh, I didn't align with them,"""
103,00:05:19.10,00:05:19.10,"and we're, like,   ""This time, no, baby doll."
104,00:05:20.63,00:05:20.63,"You're not going to look good."""
105,00:05:22.13,00:05:22.13,   I'm here to play the game.
106,00:05:23.43,00:05:23.43,  I'm going to play the da... game.
107,00:05:25.03,00:05:25.03,I don't give a rat's ass  what people think about me.
108,00:05:27.60,00:05:27.60, I don't have to prove anything to anybody.
109,00:05:29.60,00:05:29.60,I know who I am.
110,00:05:30.60,00:05:30.60," So, who cares?"
111,00:05:32.30,00:05:32.30,COLLEEN: That's what's so interesting   about this
112,00:05:34.20,00:05:34.20," is, I'm getting to see  the breakdown"
113,00:05:36.47,00:05:36.47," of the Tagi alliance, which is really funny."
114,00:05:38.70,00:05:38.70,  Everybody is very concerned   of the money at this point.
115,00:05:41.63,00:05:41.63," Like Sean would say,    ""It's a one-in-six chance"
116,00:05:43.47,00:05:43.47," of winning $1 million"""
117,00:05:44.90,00:05:44.90,  and nobody's going  to throw that away.
118,00:05:46.87,00:05:46.87,   They'll be gunning for us   if they're not already.
119,00:05:48.60,00:05:48.60,   I think they are.
120,00:05:49.60,00:05:49.60,"We'll beat them, man."
121,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,  There comes a point
122,00:05:52.00,00:05:52.00,"  where you have to turncoat  a little bit,"
123,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,"  be a little more strategic,"
124,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40, a little more   self-preservative.
125,00:05:55.90,00:05:55.90,It's a serious contest.
126,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17, There's a lot   of money at stake
127,00:05:58.63,00:05:58.63,"  and, uh, I'd better  start treating it that way."
128,00:06:00.63,00:06:00.63, No one's here just to  make friends and shake hands
129,00:06:02.97,00:06:02.97, and have relationships   for the rest of the time.
130,00:06:05.07,00:06:05.07," Where's-where's Kelly and, uh, Sue?"
131,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,They went for wood.
132,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,They went for wood--that way?
133,00:06:09.40,00:06:09.40,That way.
134,00:06:11.00,00:06:11.00,"  So, now, it's you and  me to the end, period."
135,00:06:12.97,00:06:12.97, I've given you my word.
136,00:06:14.23,00:06:14.23,"You know,if-if I got ( no audio )"
137,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,along the way
138,00:06:17.23,00:06:17.23,"like somebody had gave methe word,"
139,00:06:18.83,00:06:18.83,I'd do somethingto them.
140,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07, You're the only one
141,00:06:21.40,00:06:21.40, I've been able to trust from the beginning.
142,00:06:22.40,00:06:22.40,And you canright to the end.
143,00:06:23.73,00:06:23.73,Right.
144,00:06:25.03,00:06:25.03,COLLEEN:This is definitely what happens
145,00:06:28.13,00:06:28.13,  when you put a big chunk   of cheese in a maze
146,00:06:31.20,00:06:31.20," and let all the mice go at it,    you know?"
147,00:06:33.77,00:06:33.77, And see who eats whoand who scrambles on top of who
148,00:06:38.20,00:06:38.20, and I don't want to be anypart of it.
149,00:06:40.53,00:06:40.53,"  It's... not a fun game, no."
150,00:06:53.40,00:06:53.40,KELLY:What does it say?

159,00:07:11.53,00:07:11.53," Not that my brain's any good,   but, uh..."
160,00:07:14.53,00:07:14.53,  I'd rather use thatthan my muscles

425,00:18:39.53,00:18:39.53, Did I tell ya that?
426,00:18:40.80,00:18:40.80, I can't believe you got my father here.
427,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"Oh, my God, Dad, youmade my whole adventure."
428,00:18:46.93,00:18:46.93,"Hey, shrimp."
429,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,   I cannot tell you
430,00:18:49.27,00:18:49.27,   how much more   this is worth
431,00:18:50.43,00:18:50.43,  than a million  dollars to me.
432,00:18:51.77,00:18:51.77,I can't...
433,00:18:51.77,00:18:51.77,Money's nothing.
434,00:18:53.13,00:18:53.13, SEAN: I thought the reward
435,00:18:54.60,00:18:54.60, ample enough to spend   a night on a yacht
436,00:18:56.67,00:18:56.67," and get a massage, a shower,   a shave..."
437,00:18:58.90,00:18:58.90,"  and to see my father then,"
438,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,  I mean it was just   a dream come true.
439,00:19:02.43,00:19:02.43,"So, so much."
440,00:19:04.10,00:19:04.10,  He's got his heart
441,00:19:06.07,00:19:06.07,   twice as big   as this body.
442,00:19:08.40,00:19:08.40,It's twice as big as your body.
443,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,"  It's the truth, son."
444,00:19:11.70,00:19:11.70,"I'd walkon nails, coals,"
445,00:19:13.90,00:19:13.90,I don't care. Anything.
446,00:19:16.80,00:19:16.80,"Yeah, me, too. Me, too."
447,00:19:19.57,00:19:19.57,I don't know why the bond's so strong.
448,00:19:21.50,00:19:21.50, It is.
449,00:19:22.80,00:19:22.80,   We got a very strong bond.
450,00:19:24.13,00:19:24.13," You're the best, Dad."
451,00:19:25.47,00:19:25.47,  Your dad is looped.
452,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47,"Yeah, yeah."

509,00:22:17.87,00:22:17.87,   It was enjoyable.
510,00:22:19.33,00:22:19.33,   I just kept eating   while they talked
511,00:22:21.03,00:22:21.03, and answered questions  as I chewed.
512,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,  JIM:  It was rocking for me.
513,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,  SEAN:  We had an hour  boat ride here
514,00:22:26.47,00:22:26.47,and then we polished offtwo bottles of wine.
515,00:22:29.20,00:22:29.20,   We confessed how much   we loved each other
516,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,and all that goodfather-son stuff.
517,00:22:33.07,00:22:33.07,"  Oh, my God."

528,00:22:53.73,00:22:53.73, SUSAN: Six more days of rice.
529,00:22:57.83,00:22:57.83, I might even skip the last day  of eating altogether
530,00:23:01.43,00:23:01.43, just not to eat rice.
531,00:23:09.53,00:23:09.53, Mexican food.
532,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,   Shrimp fajitas...

536,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,"COLLEEN:  Sean is seeing that he's   in a little bit of trouble,"
537,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50, and he should probably   have Rich out there
538,00:23:28.57,00:23:28.57, because Rich is going  to make sure
539,00:23:30.33,00:23:30.33, that I get booted off tonight  and not him.
540,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,Maybe somewhere  he's thinking that.
541,00:23:34.63,00:23:34.63,   He's smart if he's thinking that.
542,00:23:36.47,00:23:36.47,  I like that.
543,00:23:37.60,00:23:37.60,"Good job, Sean."
544,00:23:38.63,00:23:38.63, I can't figure out why
545,00:23:40.33,00:23:40.33,"he switched at the last minute,"
546,00:23:42.63,00:23:42.63,  but all them ladies are pissed off at him.
547,00:23:45.77,00:23:45.77,   Rich had better   made a haul back.
548,00:23:56.57,00:23:56.57,"  Jeff, literally..."
549,00:23:58.27,00:23:58.27, I have so much   to tell you guys.
550,00:24:00.93,00:24:00.93,   I am definitely getting...
551,00:24:03.27,00:24:03.27,"   Oh, you all right?"
552,00:24:04.73,00:24:04.73,You all right?
553,00:24:05.90,00:24:05.90,I got caughtin the rope.
554,00:24:08.33,00:24:08.33,  Six out of six  votes tonight.
555,00:24:11.03,00:24:11.03,"Unless you cameback with something,"
556,00:24:12.57,00:24:12.57, we don't care if you're back.
557,00:24:13.97,00:24:13.97,"This is my father, guys."
558,00:24:15.63,00:24:15.63,What?
559,00:24:16.77,00:24:16.77,"Rudy, come onover here."
560,00:24:18.20,00:24:18.20,  Sean's father.
561,00:24:19.60,00:24:19.60,( laughing )
562,00:24:21.50,00:24:21.50,   SEAN:   I have so much   to tell you guys.
563,00:24:24.00,00:24:24.00,Maybe we could tell him
564,00:24:25.57,00:24:25.57,how dumb you were notto take Kelly withwhen you owed her.
565,00:24:29.03,00:24:29.03,He's catching foodfor everybody.
566,00:24:30.87,00:24:30.87,Pay back your debtsbefore you...

572,00:24:38.37,00:24:38.37,  Kelly.
573,00:24:39.67,00:24:39.67,  He's provided food  for us 50 times.
574,00:24:41.40,00:24:41.40,"  When Sean's dad first came,  to the tell you the truth,"
575,00:24:44.53,00:24:44.53,I almost cried because I started thinking about my mom
576,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53, and I miss her a lot.
577,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,"  You know, Sean just gets all the breaks."
578,00:24:52.40,00:24:52.40,"But, uh, you know, it was good."
579,00:24:54.80,00:24:54.80, I felt happy for him
580,00:24:56.27,00:24:56.27,"  and he is the family kid,    you know."
581,00:24:58.30,00:24:58.30,"  So, it was good for him."
582,00:24:59.97,00:24:59.97,  It was nice to have  a new face around and stuff.
583,00:25:01.77,00:25:01.77,Never caught a fish?
584,00:25:03.13,00:25:03.13,  Never caught a fish.

588,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,There's nothing.
589,00:25:11.97,00:25:11.97,  SUSAN:  What's the stock  market been doing?
590,00:25:13.10,00:25:13.10,  Staying steady  or going up?
591,00:25:14.30,00:25:14.30,"Oh, no."
592,00:25:15.30,00:25:15.30,We had somebad days there.

597,00:25:23.57,00:25:23.57,"  the last few days,  I don't know."
598,00:25:25.67,00:25:25.67,"   Actually, for him to come   and visit the camp"
599,00:25:27.73,00:25:27.73,"   was sort of cool,  but he didn't know anything."
600,00:25:29.73,00:25:29.73,So that war overin Russia
601,00:25:31.80,00:25:31.80,   sort of   mellowed out?

603,00:25:34.80,00:25:34.80,   They had that   one there...

607,00:25:40.37,00:25:40.37,  He didn't know none of that.
608,00:25:42.13,00:25:42.13,  What about the  college play-offs?
609,00:25:43.70,00:25:43.70," Dad, you know  anything about that?"
610,00:25:45.20,00:25:45.20,"Oh, yeah, waita minute."

618,00:25:58.30,00:25:58.30,He's lovable but a doof.
619,00:26:01.40,00:26:01.40,   Come say good-bye   to my pop.

625,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,"Oh, boy."
626,00:26:13.57,00:26:13.57,It's like Santa Claus.
627,00:26:14.87,00:26:14.87,Daddy Claus.
628,00:26:16.87,00:26:16.87, What's this stuff?
629,00:26:18.27,00:26:18.27,This is J. Peterman hat.
630,00:26:20.30,00:26:20.30,Guess what this is?
631,00:26:22.87,00:26:22.87,   He needs clothes.
632,00:26:23.87,00:26:23.87,  Thank you.
633,00:26:24.87,00:26:24.87,   He's been smelly.
634,00:26:25.87,00:26:25.87,When he goes to leavethis afternoon
635,00:26:27.97,00:26:27.97,"an hour and a half ago,he has this gray bag."
636,00:26:31.30,00:26:31.30,   And in it's a care package  for each one of us.

643,00:26:45.47,00:26:45.47,  ( shouting )
644,00:26:48.13,00:26:48.13," So, in it we each got   a little something"
645,00:26:49.83,00:26:49.83,   from one of our loved onesfrom back home.

649,00:26:57.10,00:26:57.10," You know what that is,   don't you?"
650,00:26:59.67,00:26:59.67, I'm getting nauseous already.
651,00:27:06.90,00:27:06.90," SUSAN:   ""Even though we are apart, just remember"
652,00:27:09.03,00:27:09.03,"  you are always in my heart."""
653,00:27:10.70,00:27:10.70,"COLLEEN:  We all got thrown a bone,"
654,00:27:12.70,00:27:12.70," which was amazingly,   wonderfully great,"
655,00:27:15.43,00:27:15.43," because now I feel like I can   do this for six more days,"
656,00:27:18.53,00:27:18.53,and I definitely will...
657,00:27:20.23,00:27:20.23," I'm on a sugar high right now,"
658,00:27:21.63,00:27:21.63," more than I have been  in a month,"

676,00:27:56.07,00:27:56.07, I'm drifting away for a while.
677,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,Just kind of going home.
678,00:27:58.97,00:27:58.97,   That's phenomenal.
679,00:28:00.47,00:28:00.47,"   God, I can't wait  to get out of here."
680,00:28:02.30,00:28:02.30, Sean's father came back   with a bag
681,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,"  filled with things for each of us from particular people,"
682,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,and this made it from the mostwonderful woman on the planet--
683,00:28:11.77,00:28:11.77,Valerie.
684,00:28:13.23,00:28:13.23, She just printed out   the e-mail
685,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,  that she was having    with her husband
686,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17, who's another incredible man--    a close friend of mine--
687,00:28:21.23,00:28:21.23,   and it just takes me back to my real world life
688,00:28:25.77,00:28:25.77,and has my brain engagedand rejuvenated
689,00:28:29.60,00:28:29.60,and out of these
690,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10," 16, whoever they are, people,"
691,00:28:33.83,00:28:33.83,  and into who I am
692,00:28:35.30,00:28:35.30,and just knowing what's going on
693,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,   and that's it's back there
694,00:28:39.00,00:28:39.00,and what I'm about to experience when I go back
695,00:28:42.00,00:28:42.00," and, you know,  I can last the other"
696,00:28:44.07,00:28:44.07,"whatever's left, seven days, six days."
697,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"Hey, guys."
698,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"  Hi, Jeff!"
699,00:29:00.90,00:29:00.90, JEFF:This challenge is for immunity.
700,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87, Whoever wins gets the talismanand cannot be voted off
701,00:29:06.07,00:29:06.07,  at tonight's Tribal Council.
702,00:29:07.80,00:29:07.80,"It's all about will, this game."
703,00:29:09.60,00:29:09.60,  You're going to be  standing on planks.
704,00:29:12.10,00:29:12.10," Over a period of time,"
705,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,  I'm going to remove certain planks
706,00:29:14.83,00:29:14.83, till we get down to one plank.
707,00:29:16.67,00:29:16.67,  Last person standing   gets the talisman
708,00:29:18.40,00:29:18.40,  and is safe tonight.
709,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,"This game could take 15 minutes,"
710,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00,it could take 15 hours.
711,00:29:22.03,00:29:22.03, You will decide that.
712,00:29:23.97,00:29:23.97,   Only rule:
713,00:29:25.70,00:29:25.70,"You can't touch anybody,"
714,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,but you can taunt all you want.
715,00:29:29.87,00:29:29.87,All right?
716,00:29:30.90,00:29:30.90,Let's go out and do it.

753,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,   See you on shore.
754,00:31:56.57,00:31:56.57,"RICHARD:So it's ironicthat Colleen is even trying,"
755,00:31:59.60,00:31:59.60,because she thinksshe's dead tonight.
756,00:32:02.10,00:32:02.10,"I asked her today, ""Colleen,what makes you happy?"""
757,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,"  And she said,  ""You know, Rich,  irony makes me happy."""
758,00:32:06.73,00:32:06.73,So I think it's ironic
759,00:32:08.97,00:32:08.97,that she's tryingto stay on the board
760,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,  and she's not even  in danger
761,00:32:12.47,00:32:12.47,   of getting voted off.
762,00:32:13.57,00:32:13.57,"   Kelly, on the other hand,"
763,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,  has no idea that she's  leaving this evening.
764,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,   But it's still...
765,00:32:20.20,00:32:20.20,   RUDY:   I'll bet Sean gets   two votes from the girls.
766,00:32:22.83,00:32:22.83," Yeah, Sean may get votes from Colleen."
767,00:32:25.10,00:32:25.10,Colleen and...
768,00:32:26.83,00:32:26.83,   And maybe Kelly   just to throw a vote.
769,00:32:28.53,00:32:28.53,"Yeah, 'cause Kelly'strying to look"
770,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30,as if she's not partof the voting bloc.
771,00:32:32.37,00:32:32.37,"There they go...ooh, ooh, ooh."
772,00:32:34.00,00:32:34.00, Go! Go!
773,00:32:35.53,00:32:35.53,  Look at her.  She's almost gone.
774,00:32:37.27,00:32:37.27,"But she'sMiss Dancer,"
775,00:32:39.10,00:32:39.10,  so maybe she's  got balance.
776,00:32:41.53,00:32:41.53,  He's cut one side.
777,00:32:42.60,00:32:42.60,  Now he's cut the other
778,00:32:44.03,00:32:44.03,   and they're   all wobbling.
779,00:32:45.30,00:32:45.30, Look at the wobble.
780,00:32:46.67,00:32:46.67,And the play-by-play
781,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,"  as we look at Sue,"
782,00:32:49.93,00:32:49.93,"   she's got the arms   up level across the side,"
783,00:32:51.30,00:32:51.30,"  but Kelly, holy Moses,"
784,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,  she looks like  she's going.
785,00:32:53.63,00:32:53.63," Back and forth. Oh, no."
786,00:32:55.03,00:32:55.03,  ( Rudy chuckling )
787,00:32:56.27,00:32:56.27," RICHARD: Colleen looking rather stable,"
788,00:32:58.17,00:32:58.17,although determined.
789,00:32:59.77,00:32:59.77,"   Really trying to hang on,"
790,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67, thinking she's about to be ejected this evening.
791,00:33:04.40,00:33:04.40,Sean's just as goofyas ever...
792,00:33:06.13,00:33:06.13,  and there he goes.
793,00:33:07.40,00:33:07.40,Sean falls off the boardand it is down to three.
794,00:33:09.77,00:33:09.77,   Look at them.
795,00:33:11.73,00:33:11.73,"Oh, Sue!"
796,00:33:13.03,00:33:13.03, It's Kelly and Colleen.
797,00:33:14.70,00:33:14.70, Holy Moses.
798,00:33:18.73,00:33:18.73,"Okay, Sue, so if it's...if Kelly wins immunity"
799,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,   what happens?
800,00:33:25.03,00:33:25.03,Sean or Colleen?
801,00:33:27.43,00:33:27.43,I'm thinking Sean.
802,00:33:29.07,00:33:29.07,   Are you thinking Sean   before Colleen?
803,00:33:30.37,00:33:30.37,What are youthinking?
804,00:33:31.90,00:33:31.90,   I'll go with what   you guys say.
805,00:33:33.07,00:33:33.07,What do you say?
806,00:33:34.23,00:33:34.23,  I say Sean.
807,00:33:35.47,00:33:35.47, SUSAN: Take the wisdom of the old man.
808,00:33:37.87,00:33:37.87, Take the wisdom of the old man.
809,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90," Rudy says Sean,"
810,00:33:41.10,00:33:41.10," so if Kelly hangs in there,"
811,00:33:42.70,00:33:42.70,  Sean is out of  here tonight!
812,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,"   So, we've got   to watch"
813,00:33:45.40,00:33:45.40,'cause it's downto the wire.
814,00:33:51.27,00:33:51.27,You aren't cold afterbeing out there for so long?
815,00:33:54.20,00:33:54.20,  I've got to dry offbefore I put clothes on.
816,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,"No, I'm fatterthan you, remember."
817,00:33:58.47,00:33:58.47,   There goes Kelly.
818,00:33:59.47,00:33:59.47,  They're both gone.
819,00:34:00.53,00:34:00.53,"I think whenone wobbles,"
820,00:34:02.30,00:34:02.30,the other wobbles.
821,00:34:03.60,00:34:03.60,"   Oh, God, Colleen."
822,00:34:05.63,00:34:05.63,This isreally good.
823,00:34:21.43,00:34:21.43, Am I getting voted off   if I fall?
824,00:34:24.27,00:34:24.27,   Not by me.
825,00:34:27.00,00:34:27.00,  By the rest?
826,00:34:28.43,00:34:28.43,"   I don't know,   honey."
827,00:34:30.47,00:34:30.47,   I'm guessing yes.
828,00:34:43.97,00:34:43.97," JEFF:Kelly, you got immunity."
829,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,  JEFF:  Colleen moved.
830,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,"  SEAN:  Good job, Wiggles."
831,00:34:50.60,00:34:50.60, Whoo!
832,00:34:54.33,00:34:54.33,Well-earned.
833,00:34:56.43,00:34:56.43,   Very well-earned.
834,00:34:59.70,00:34:59.70,   Because this is so...
835,00:35:01.20,00:35:01.20,"   all you guys were   doing out there,"
836,00:35:02.60,00:35:02.60,"were saying, ""My feet are dying,  my feet are dying."""
837,00:35:05.43,00:35:05.43,  What are you wearing   to Tribal Council tonight?
838,00:35:07.63,00:35:07.63,Shoes?
839,00:35:08.70,00:35:08.70,Shoes.
840,00:35:10.20,00:35:10.20," Okay, insoles   from Dr. Scholl's."
841,00:35:11.70,00:35:11.70," Hopefully, they'll give you a little padding on that."
842,00:35:14.60,00:35:14.60," SUSAN:Good job, Kelly."
843,00:35:16.40,00:35:16.40, KELLY:   Thank you.
844,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93, KELLY: This stupid alliance thing--
845,00:35:29.63,00:35:29.63,"  I don't even care  about that anymore, you know?"
846,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"I say I'm not... I'm not in it anymore,"
847,00:35:34.27,00:35:34.27,"   I'm voting my conscience, and, you know,"
848,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,  I want to be true to myself  and who I am
849,00:35:39.27,00:35:39.27, and keep my dignity--   who cares?
850,00:35:41.23,00:35:41.23,"COLLEEN:Kelly-- she was a double agent, so to speak, you know,"
851,00:35:44.80,00:35:44.80," talking to the Pagong people,"
852,00:35:46.47,00:35:46.47, really trying  to get in with them
853,00:35:48.13,00:35:48.13,  and then relaying everything   we said to her teammates.
854,00:35:50.87,00:35:50.87,"  The, uh, the Pagong people,  fortunately"
855,00:35:52.57,00:35:52.57,"   picked up on that, 'cause they all came to me in unison"
856,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00," and they said,""I think Kelly's up to no good,"""
857,00:35:57.10,00:35:57.10,"and, uh, so... so it wasvery plastic, very see-through,"
858,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57," and even her biggest advocate  on this island, Sue,"
859,00:36:02.53,00:36:02.53, saw right through that.
860,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00, KELLY:  I'm voting strategically.
861,00:36:05.50,00:36:05.50,"  So are they, and they stillthink I'm in the stupid alliance"
862,00:36:08.30,00:36:08.30," because if I told them  I didn't want to be,"
863,00:36:10.23,00:36:10.23,"   they'd vote me off, so I'm   trying to save my own ass."
864,00:36:12.53,00:36:12.53,   So how bold and wonderfulis that?
865,00:36:14.50,00:36:14.50," SUSAN:  Me and Kelly, I thought,  had a real friendship going."
866,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30, I really did.
867,00:36:18.70,00:36:18.70,"  But, uh, when I turn around"
868,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,"   and see somebody startingto dig a knife into my backside,"
869,00:36:23.00,00:36:23.00, it just really pisses me off.
870,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,  I don't care what I say to people.
871,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,  I don't care... if I'm nice  to anybody at camp anymore.
872,00:36:31.90,00:36:31.90," I do not give a ..., and it feels so good."
873,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83," It's great, I love it."
874,00:36:47.40,00:36:47.40, Welcome to Tribal Council 11.
875,00:36:50.87,00:36:50.87,We're going to bringin our jury now.
876,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"  It consists of Greg, Jenna"
877,00:36:54.63,00:36:54.63,"and, as of last week,Gervase"
878,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,who was the last personvoted off.
879,00:36:59.33,00:36:59.33,   Two of you will make   it to the final vote.
880,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,The other fourwill join these three
881,00:37:03.43,00:37:03.43,and will decidewho gets the million dollars.
882,00:37:05.47,00:37:05.47,So let's talk about
883,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,what's gone on sincethe last Tribal Council.
884,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,"A busy, busy time--a lot of it"
885,00:37:11.63,00:37:11.63,"   hovering around you, Sean."
886,00:37:13.57,00:37:13.57,"   One decision, though,   you had to make"
887,00:37:15.80,00:37:15.80," was, right as we left,   heading out to the yacht,"
888,00:37:18.13,00:37:18.13,"I said, ""you know what? Why don't you invite somebody"
889,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,"for breakfast."""
890,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,Correct.
891,00:37:22.40,00:37:22.40,Puts you ina tough spot.
892,00:37:22.40,00:37:22.40,Very tough spot.
893,00:37:25.07,00:37:25.07,   You had to pick somebody.
894,00:37:27.90,00:37:27.90,Absolutely.
895,00:37:29.40,00:37:29.40,So what made you change your mind at the last minute?
896,00:37:31.67,00:37:31.67,Rich provides food.
897,00:37:33.13,00:37:33.13,"KELLY:Yeah, but let's not forgetthe fact that you said,"
898,00:37:36.73,00:37:36.73,"   ""Kelly, all right, I'm going to take you,"
899,00:37:38.10,00:37:38.10," ""but you can give it to Rich,"
900,00:37:39.30,00:37:39.30,"so I don't know,it's in your hands."""
901,00:37:41.27,00:37:41.27," I'll tell you why, and she knows this."
902,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,Rich also gave ustons of food.
903,00:37:45.13,00:37:45.13,He goes out every day
904,00:37:46.30,00:37:46.30,"fishing for four hours,"
905,00:37:47.63,00:37:47.63,   comes back with something in his basket
906,00:37:48.97,00:37:48.97," nine out of ten times, which is really great"
907,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,for the tribe.
908,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,But you didn't say that.
909,00:37:52.23,00:37:52.23," This is what I'm thinking, so..."
910,00:37:53.83,00:37:53.83,A day later.
911,00:37:53.83,00:37:53.83,No.
912,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,"   What do you mean,   a day later?   Not at all."
913,00:37:58.23,00:37:58.23, He was in my thoughts  when I mentioned breakfast.
914,00:38:00.43,00:38:00.43,He really wanted   to go on that ship
915,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,during the contest--I factored allthat into it
916,00:38:03.77,00:38:03.77," and I said, ""Kelly, who wants to come?"""
917,00:38:05.43,00:38:05.43,   And I yelled from the ship
918,00:38:06.63,00:38:06.63,and I just made  an instant decision.
919,00:38:07.63,00:38:07.63,If it was the wrong one
920,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87, and it gets me a vote from Kelly...
921,00:38:09.87,00:38:09.87,"   I'm sorry, Kelly."
922,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"It's not about the food,Sean-- it's the fact"
923,00:38:13.20,00:38:13.20,"that the whole day before,you were saying,"
924,00:38:15.13,00:38:15.13,"""Oh, I'm goingto take you, and..."""
925,00:38:16.77,00:38:16.77,"I mean, you don'towe me anything."
926,00:38:18.40,00:38:18.40,It's not about that.
927,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,So...
928,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,It's just the factthat you were saying...
929,00:38:21.70,00:38:21.70," I felt obliged, that's all."
930,00:38:23.13,00:38:23.13, JEFF: Okay...
931,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,Richard.
932,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,Yeah?
933,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,"Two Tribal Councils ago,you got three votes."
934,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,Yeah.
935,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,The only thing
936,00:38:30.23,00:38:30.23, that saved you  was the now-infamous
937,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"  ""alphabet system,"""
938,00:38:33.90,00:38:33.90,  which cast a  vote for Jenna
939,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,was the swing vote.
940,00:38:36.70,00:38:36.70,"I mean, other peoplevoted for Jenna,"
941,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,but it wasthat swing vote
942,00:38:39.80,00:38:39.80, that was based on the alphabet that saved you.
943,00:38:41.63,00:38:41.63,"   It looked that way, yeah."
944,00:38:42.70,00:38:42.70,"  It seems like at this point,"
945,00:38:44.37,00:38:44.37,"   if I'm just looking at it   on paper,"
946,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23,  you would be in  a very precarious  situation tonight.
947,00:38:48.10,00:38:48.10, I could be going home tonight.
948,00:38:49.57,00:38:49.57,Absolutely.
949,00:38:50.97,00:38:50.97,"  JEFF:  How about you,  Colleen?"
950,00:38:52.13,00:38:52.13,"Last Tribal Council,you said,"
951,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,"""I'm either going tonight, Jeff,"
952,00:38:55.50,00:38:55.50,"  or I'm going   the next Tribal Council."""
953,00:38:57.10,00:38:57.10," I mean, I'm feeling...   I'm feeling, uh..."
954,00:38:59.43,00:38:59.43,"  I'm feeling like I'm going, yeah."
955,00:39:01.23,00:39:01.23,"I mean, I'm the last..."
956,00:39:03.03,00:39:03.03,I'm the last ofmy kind... here.
957,00:39:05.20,00:39:05.20,I'm the last Pagong.
958,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,"So, uh, yeah."
959,00:39:07.87,00:39:07.87,JEFF:What's your gut onhow nasty it's going to get?
960,00:39:11.37,00:39:11.37,  Mm... what's my guton how nasty it's going to get?
961,00:39:15.03,00:39:15.03,It's going to get pretty nasty.
962,00:39:17.03,00:39:17.03,"There's a lot of, uh...a lot of stuff going on."
963,00:39:20.13,00:39:20.13,"Okay, it's time to vote."
964,00:39:21.80,00:39:21.80, Rich.
965,00:39:30.37,00:39:30.37, Whoa.
966,00:39:38.13,00:39:38.13, Um...
967,00:39:40.97,00:39:40.97,   why are you going tonight?
968,00:39:42.50,00:39:42.50,Because you screwed up.
969,00:39:44.03,00:39:44.03,  It wasn't your turn.
970,00:39:45.23,00:39:45.23,"  You were supposed to stay,"
971,00:39:46.93,00:39:46.93,  so you're actually    being sacrificed
972,00:39:48.70,00:39:48.70,  even though   you were supposed to stay.
973,00:39:53.80,00:39:53.80,   But... good night.
974,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,"I can't vote for myself,"
975,00:40:12.63,00:40:12.63," so I've got to vote for Sean,"
976,00:40:14.80,00:40:14.80,"   because, uh... same reason as last week, really."
977,00:40:19.13,00:40:19.13,  He knows. He knows.
978,00:40:30.57,00:40:30.57,   24-7 is all I have to say.
979,00:40:41.10,00:40:41.10,I'm voting for Colleen.
980,00:40:42.40,00:40:42.40,"Even though she calls me a putz all the time,"
981,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"   I know we're good friends, and I like her a lot."
982,00:40:46.47,00:40:46.47,   She's a cool girl.
983,00:40:47.93,00:40:47.93,"   So, I'm voting...   changing her name"
984,00:40:49.57,00:40:49.57," to ""Cooleen,"" and, uh,    she's a really cool girl."
985,00:40:52.27,00:40:52.27," I enjoyed her company,"
986,00:40:54.10,00:40:54.10,   and I'll probably see her  next vote...
987,00:40:56.27,00:40:56.27,  in the jury.
988,00:41:03.20,00:41:03.20, JEFF:  Across from you now
989,00:41:05.23,00:41:05.23,are ten torches
990,00:41:07.60,00:41:07.60, representing the first ten people voted off.
991,00:41:09.87,00:41:09.87,  Tonight we will add one more staff to that group.
992,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,I'll go tally the votes.
993,00:41:41.30,00:41:41.30,"  Once your votes are tallied, the decision is final."
994,00:41:44.03,00:41:44.03,The person will be askedto leave the island immediately.
995,00:41:47.33,00:41:47.33,"   They will return, however,   to the next Tribal Council"
996,00:41:50.30,00:41:50.30,  as the fourth member   of our final jury.
997,00:41:53.63,00:41:53.63,  I'll read the votes.
998,00:41:58.83,00:41:58.83, First vote...
999,00:42:03.20,00:42:03.20, Sean.
1000,00:42:11.93,00:42:11.93,Colleen.
1001,00:42:17.50,00:42:17.50,Colleen.
1002,00:42:25.33,00:42:25.33, Sean.
1003,00:42:27.63,00:42:27.63, Two votes for Colleen;  two votes for Sean.
1004,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,  Three votes Colleen.
1005,00:42:44.80,00:42:44.80,"Colleen, you need tobring me your torch."
1006,00:42:46.80,00:42:46.80,"  ( quietly ):  Be nice to each other, okay?"
1007,00:42:49.03,00:42:49.03,"I swear to God,   I'm watching you."
1008,00:42:53.43,00:42:53.43,Bye. Okay.
1009,00:42:58.83,00:42:58.83,"Play fair, okay?"
1010,00:43:10.57,00:43:10.57,"  Colleen, the tribe  has spoken."
1011,00:43:18.00,00:43:18.00,  It's time  for you to go.
1012,00:43:19.23,00:43:19.23,Okay. No regrets.
1013,00:43:20.63,00:43:20.63,Okay.
1014,00:43:20.63,00:43:20.63,"Okay, bye."
1015,00:43:21.87,00:43:21.87,Good-bye.
1016,00:43:21.87,00:43:21.87,"Bye, Colleen."
1017,00:43:31.83,00:43:31.83," Well, I heard Colleen's last words:"
