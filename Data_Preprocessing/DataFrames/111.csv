1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.73,00:00:01.73,   ANNOUNCER:  Last week on Survivor:
3,00:00:04.43,00:00:04.43,  Rich woke up with   a Tribal Council hangover...
4,00:00:07.00,00:00:07.00,I got bombarded at the council.
5,00:00:08.50,00:00:08.50, A little alliance tried
6,00:00:09.97,00:00:09.97,  to attack Richie     on my birthday.
7,00:00:11.93,00:00:11.93,   ANNOUNCER:   So he decided to fight back  by catching fewer fish.
8,00:00:14.70,00:00:14.70,"And I'm, like, you backstabbers,   Colleen and Gervase."
9,00:00:16.93,00:00:16.93,"First, you want him out of here"
10,00:00:18.77,00:00:18.77, and then you're    all over the food.
11,00:00:21.80,00:00:21.80, Uh...
12,00:00:24.27,00:00:24.27,   ANNOUNCER:  But Sue did some backstabbing   on her own...
13,00:00:27.87,00:00:27.87, I never trusted Rich.
14,00:00:29.07,00:00:29.07, He's a snake.
15,00:00:31.33,00:00:31.33,   ANNOUNCER:   And cracks appeared     in the alliance.
16,00:00:32.97,00:00:32.97,   Making a deal with Rich is
17,00:00:34.27,00:00:34.27, kind of like   making a deal with the devil.
18,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,   ANNOUNCER:  But it was Rich   who burned the competition...
19,00:00:40.60,00:00:40.60,Yeah!
20,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53,"   ANNOUNCER:  And won the big prize,     immunity."
21,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77," Unable to vote for Rich  at the council,"
22,00:00:48.40,00:00:48.40,  Sue and Kelly stuck     with the alliance
23,00:00:50.70,00:00:50.70,  and sent Gervase packing.
24,00:00:52.37,00:00:52.37,  JEFF PROBST: Gervase.
25,00:00:54.10,00:00:54.10,   ANNOUNCER:    Only six remain.
26,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83, Who will be voted off tonight?

28,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,   ( birds chirping )
29,00:02:15.00,00:02:15.00, RICH:  Just woke up.
30,00:02:18.20,00:02:18.20,  I'm wet.
31,00:02:19.63,00:02:19.63," So, I guess it rained    last night,"
32,00:02:21.70,00:02:21.70, but I slept through it.
33,00:02:23.27,00:02:23.27,  Today is the... 31st day...
34,00:02:25.27,00:02:25.27,I think.
35,00:02:26.77,00:02:26.77," All I know is, this is   the ninth day till the end."
36,00:02:30.33,00:02:30.33, KELLY:  People were kind of miserable   this morning.
37,00:02:33.77,00:02:33.77,  I was one of the miserable.
38,00:02:36.33,00:02:36.33,"  I mean, every day's     a little tough because..."
39,00:02:39.93,00:02:39.93,   we don't have a lot to do   and we're-we're low energy.
40,00:02:42.90,00:02:42.90," Rich has gotten really,    really weak"
41,00:02:46.47,00:02:46.47,  and really crabby     and really hungry
42,00:02:49.57,00:02:49.57,  an-and Sean also.
43,00:02:51.33,00:02:51.33,  I got to try  to put on some weight
44,00:02:52.60,00:02:52.60,   before I go home.
45,00:02:53.90,00:02:53.90,  Everyone's telling   me I look ugly.
46,00:02:55.33,00:02:55.33,"  The food I miss,  but not as much as my parents."
47,00:02:57.33,00:02:57.33," The hardest part, uh, for me,   about being here, um"
48,00:03:00.13,00:03:00.13,is that I miss my family
49,00:03:01.57,00:03:01.57,"and, uh... like I've reiterated  a thousand times over"
50,00:03:04.70,00:03:04.70,"  I'm no mama's boy,   but I'd really like"
51,00:03:06.70,00:03:06.70,  to see my family.
52,00:03:08.10,00:03:08.10, It would mean     an enormous amount to me.
53,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13, When you think of their smiles
54,00:03:11.57,00:03:11.57," and their hugs   and stuff like that,"
55,00:03:12.93,00:03:12.93, I just can't wait to see them.
56,00:03:14.73,00:03:14.73,  ( birds squawking )
57,00:03:24.13,00:03:24.13, KELLY:   Colleen's legs are  pretty beat up.
58,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23, She's gotten  some pretty bad gashes
59,00:03:28.23,00:03:28.23, and she has some sores  up higher on her legs
60,00:03:30.53,00:03:30.53, that she doesn't know   how she got.
61,00:03:36.77,00:03:36.77,COLLEEN:    My legs are bothering me.
62,00:03:39.20,00:03:39.20,"  I mean, I would be lying"
63,00:03:41.33,00:03:41.33,   if I said my legs   aren't bothering me.
64,00:03:44.20,00:03:44.20, They-they hurt a lot.
65,00:03:46.07,00:03:46.07,I have all these
66,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,"and then, I have these new ones."
67,00:03:49.87,00:03:49.87, I can't sleep    because they itch so bad.
68,00:03:52.27,00:03:52.27,"So, I get a scar  and then I itch it off"
69,00:03:54.77,00:03:54.77,  and it... and it's just like this never-ending cycle
70,00:03:57.40,00:03:57.40,   and they're going to be like this
71,00:03:59.07,00:03:59.07,"   for the next three years,    you know?"
72,00:04:00.57,00:04:00.57, And bugs live in them.
73,00:04:02.03,00:04:02.03,"I mean, it's just awful."
74,00:04:03.63,00:04:03.63, It's so awful.
75,00:04:06.77,00:04:06.77,"  I am feeling like I've been here for 59,000 days."
76,00:04:11.10,00:04:11.10,  The past five days have been
77,00:04:13.50,00:04:13.50, the longest five days    of my entire life.
78,00:04:16.47,00:04:16.47,  I miss my old team.
79,00:04:19.20,00:04:19.20,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
80,00:04:24.67,00:04:24.67," I miss my old beach, you know?"
81,00:04:27.37,00:04:27.37,  I am the last sole survivor   of the Pagong Tribe.
82,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,  I am a dying breed.
83,00:04:32.77,00:04:32.77, Pagong gets picked off    one by one.
84,00:04:34.97,00:04:34.97, That's obvious.
85,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50," Now, I'm very confused    at where alliances stand,"
86,00:04:39.03,00:04:39.03,  and I think they're confused    at where alliances stand.
87,00:04:42.00,00:04:42.00, RICH: Try and follow all this.
88,00:04:43.80,00:04:43.80, I'm going to give you  all of what's happened.
89,00:04:45.87,00:04:45.87,COLLEEN:   Rich and Sue are promising   one thing to Sean...
90,00:04:48.50,00:04:48.50, promising another thing     to Kelly.
91,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,  Sue and Kelly are promising   one thing to Rich...
92,00:04:53.37,00:04:53.37,"npromising another thing to Sean,"
93,00:04:55.13,00:04:55.13," and then, Rudy just sits back"
94,00:04:57.23,00:04:57.23,  and watch it all happen.
95,00:04:58.97,00:04:58.97, RICH:   It seems like Kelly  might be flip-flopping
96,00:05:01.87,00:05:01.87, and planning strategies  at our expense
97,00:05:05.03,00:05:05.03,  and that just ticked Sue off    to no end.
98,00:05:07.27,00:05:07.27,"Kelly is staying  in the alliance at this time,"
99,00:05:09.53,00:05:09.53,but she's trying    to make herself look good
100,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,   to the other team
101,00:05:12.93,00:05:12.93,"  in case it comes     down to the end,"
102,00:05:14.33,00:05:14.33,  and she's   one of the last two standing
103,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17," that she will be, like, ""Oh, I didn't align with them,"""
104,00:05:19.10,00:05:19.10,"and we're, like,    ""This time, no, baby doll."
105,00:05:20.63,00:05:20.63,"You're not going to look good."""
106,00:05:22.13,00:05:22.13,   I'm here to play the game.
107,00:05:23.43,00:05:23.43,  I'm going to play the da...  game.
108,00:05:25.03,00:05:25.03,I don't give a rat's ass   what people think about me.
109,00:05:27.60,00:05:27.60, I don't have to prove  anything to anybody.
110,00:05:29.60,00:05:29.60,I know who I am.
111,00:05:30.60,00:05:30.60," So, who cares?"
112,00:05:32.30,00:05:32.30,COLLEEN:  That's what's so interesting    about this
113,00:05:34.20,00:05:34.20," is, I'm getting to see   the breakdown"
114,00:05:36.47,00:05:36.47," of the Tagi alliance,  which is really funny."
115,00:05:38.70,00:05:38.70,  Everybody is very concerned    of the money at this point.
116,00:05:41.63,00:05:41.63," Like Sean would say,     ""It's a one-in-six chance"
117,00:05:43.47,00:05:43.47," of winning $1 million"""
118,00:05:44.90,00:05:44.90,  and nobody's going   to throw that away.
119,00:05:46.87,00:05:46.87,   They'll be gunning for us    if they're not already.
120,00:05:48.60,00:05:48.60,   I think they are.
121,00:05:49.60,00:05:49.60,"We'll beat them, man."
122,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,  There comes a point
123,00:05:52.00,00:05:52.00,"  where you have to turncoat   a little bit,"
124,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,"  be a little more strategic,"
125,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40, a little more    self-preservative.
126,00:05:55.90,00:05:55.90,It's a serious contest.
127,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17, There's a lot    of money at stake
128,00:05:58.63,00:05:58.63,"  and, uh, I'd better   start treating it that way."
129,00:06:00.63,00:06:00.63, No one's here just to   make friends and shake hands
130,00:06:02.97,00:06:02.97, and have relationships    for the rest of the time.
131,00:06:05.07,00:06:05.07," Where's-where's  Kelly and, uh, Sue?"
132,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,They went for wood.
133,00:06:07.87,00:06:07.87,They went for wood-- that way?
134,00:06:09.40,00:06:09.40,That way.
135,00:06:11.00,00:06:11.00,"  So, now, it's you and   me to the end, period."
136,00:06:12.97,00:06:12.97, I've given you my word.
137,00:06:14.23,00:06:14.23,"You know, if-if I got ( no audio )"
138,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,along the way
139,00:06:17.23,00:06:17.23,"like somebody had gave me the word,"
140,00:06:18.83,00:06:18.83,I'd do something to them.
141,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07, You're the only one
142,00:06:21.40,00:06:21.40, I've been able to trust  from the beginning.
143,00:06:22.40,00:06:22.40,And you can right to the end.
144,00:06:23.73,00:06:23.73,Right.
145,00:06:25.03,00:06:25.03,COLLEEN: This is definitely what happens
146,00:06:28.13,00:06:28.13,  when you put a big chunk    of cheese in a maze
147,00:06:31.20,00:06:31.20," and let all the mice go at it,     you know?"
148,00:06:33.77,00:06:33.77, And see who eats who and who scrambles on top of who
149,00:06:38.20,00:06:38.20, and I don't want to be  anypart of it.
150,00:06:40.53,00:06:40.53,"  It's... not a fun game, no."
151,00:06:53.40,00:06:53.40,KELLY: What does it say?
152,00:06:55.53,00:06:55.53,"  ""Survivor Trivia."""

156,00:07:02.10,00:07:02.10,"  you'll workout your brain."""
157,00:07:04.10,00:07:04.10," RUDY:  Well, we got a clue last night"
158,00:07:06.07,00:07:06.07," and, uh, it says you can use   your brain, not your muscles,"
159,00:07:10.07,00:07:10.07,  which is good news.
160,00:07:11.53,00:07:11.53," Not that my brain's any good,    but, uh..."
161,00:07:14.53,00:07:14.53,  I'd rather use that than my muscles
162,00:07:17.03,00:07:17.03,  'cause the muscles hurt now.
163,00:07:19.13,00:07:19.13,"Yeah, I suck at trivia, but I love it"
164,00:07:20.97,00:07:20.97,'cause I fi... you know?
165,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,"And I'm real slow at the buzzer,"
166,00:07:23.60,00:07:23.60,but you know what I was thinking
167,00:07:24.77,00:07:24.77,before I went to bed last night?
168,00:07:26.27,00:07:26.27,"I was thinking, ""It's going to be just like a game show."
169,00:07:27.77,00:07:27.77,"This is going to be so cool,"""
170,00:07:28.77,00:07:28.77,"and then, I was like, ""Wait a minute."
171,00:07:31.50,00:07:31.50,"We're on a game show."""
172,00:07:49.53,00:07:49.53,"My friends, today..."
173,00:07:51.60,00:07:51.60,   decadence speaks.
174,00:07:53.57,00:07:53.57,"  Oh, we're liking this."
175,00:07:55.13,00:07:55.13,We've taken the visa and created a really cool night tonight
176,00:07:57.97,00:07:57.97,for one of you.
177,00:07:59.03,00:07:59.03,"Oh! No, come on."
178,00:08:01.40,00:08:01.40,  One night...
179,00:08:02.73,00:08:02.73,   on a yacht...
180,00:08:04.07,00:08:04.07,  That yacht!
181,00:08:05.13,00:08:05.13, That yacht.
182,00:08:06.37,00:08:06.37,  ( laughter )
183,00:08:07.57,00:08:07.57,"You got your TV and your stereo, sure."
184,00:08:10.83,00:08:10.83,You got your luxury dinner...
185,00:08:12.70,00:08:12.70,"Oh, my God."
186,00:08:13.83,00:08:13.83,"   With your waiter,"
187,00:08:15.00,00:08:15.00,"fresh sheets, beautiful bed and a hot, hot shower."
188,00:08:18.70,00:08:18.70,  Pretty simple--   you guys are going
189,00:08:20.07,00:08:20.07, to start at the end--
190,00:08:21.23,00:08:21.23,A-B-C...  all the way through...
191,00:08:23.13,00:08:23.13,   true/false   or multiple choice.
192,00:08:24.63,00:08:24.63, You're going to start  on the blue squares.
193,00:08:27.00,00:08:27.00," As you   answer questions correctly,"
194,00:08:28.80,00:08:28.80,you move forward  through the different colors.
195,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50," Now, if you're the last  one left on a color"
196,00:08:33.90,00:08:33.90," that the others have  already moved beyond,  you're out of the game."
197,00:08:36.83,00:08:36.83,First one on the mat

402,00:17:53.03,00:17:53.03,  I don't think he's ever had    a massage.
403,00:17:58.00,00:17:58.00," Oh, that feels so good, yeah."
404,00:18:00.43,00:18:00.43,I just hope the poor kid doesn't   make a fool out of himself.
405,00:18:03.60,00:18:03.60,Does my ass look as bony   as it feels?
406,00:18:08.23,00:18:08.23, JEFF:  The captain-- he's not going     to be steering all night.
407,00:18:11.43,00:18:11.43,   He's going to go to sleep.
408,00:18:12.53,00:18:12.53, I just wanted to introduce him to you.
409,00:18:14.20,00:18:14.20," Just for, you know..."
410,00:18:15.43,00:18:15.43,But this guy just really wanted to say hi
411,00:18:17.10,00:18:17.10,"and, you know, he's familiar with the show."
412,00:18:19.03,00:18:19.03,"He's certainly familiar with you and everything that's going on,"
413,00:18:21.77,00:18:21.77,so come on in and take the oars or whatever.
414,00:18:24.83,00:18:24.83,Hi... Captain...
415,00:18:27.40,00:18:27.40,Captain!
416,00:18:28.63,00:18:28.63,"Hey, Dad!"
417,00:18:30.23,00:18:30.23," Oh, my God!"
418,00:18:31.63,00:18:31.63,Holy Toledo!
419,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17, How's my boy?
420,00:18:34.27,00:18:34.27,"Oh, Pops, I love ya!"
421,00:18:35.33,00:18:35.33,I miss ya!
422,00:18:36.33,00:18:36.33,"   I love you, too, son."
423,00:18:37.33,00:18:37.33,"Oh, my God!"
424,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33, You look fantastic.
425,00:18:39.53,00:18:39.53,"  Oh, my God."
426,00:18:39.53,00:18:39.53, Did I tell ya that?
427,00:18:40.80,00:18:40.80, I can't believe you  got my father here.
428,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,"Oh, my God, Dad, you made my whole adventure."
429,00:18:46.93,00:18:46.93,"Hey, shrimp."
430,00:18:48.07,00:18:48.07,   I cannot tell you
431,00:18:49.27,00:18:49.27,   how much more    this is worth
432,00:18:50.43,00:18:50.43,  than a million   dollars to me.
433,00:18:51.77,00:18:51.77,I can't...
434,00:18:51.77,00:18:51.77,Money's nothing.
435,00:18:53.13,00:18:53.13, SEAN:  I thought the reward
436,00:18:54.60,00:18:54.60, ample enough to spend    a night on a yacht
437,00:18:56.67,00:18:56.67," and get a massage, a shower,    a shave..."
438,00:18:58.90,00:18:58.90,"  and to see my father then,"
439,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,  I mean it was just    a dream come true.
440,00:19:02.43,00:19:02.43,"So, so much."
441,00:19:04.10,00:19:04.10,  He's got his heart
442,00:19:06.07,00:19:06.07,   twice as big    as this body.
443,00:19:08.40,00:19:08.40,It's twice as big as your body.
444,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,"  It's the truth, son."
445,00:19:11.70,00:19:11.70,"I'd walk on nails, coals,"
446,00:19:13.90,00:19:13.90,I don't care. Anything.
447,00:19:16.80,00:19:16.80,"Yeah, me, too. Me, too."
448,00:19:19.57,00:19:19.57,I don't know why  the bond's so strong.
449,00:19:21.50,00:19:21.50, It is.
450,00:19:22.80,00:19:22.80,   We got a very strong bond.
451,00:19:24.13,00:19:24.13," You're the best, Dad."
452,00:19:25.47,00:19:25.47,  Your dad is looped.
453,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47,"Yeah, yeah."
454,00:19:27.93,00:19:27.93, Have my wine.
455,00:19:29.47,00:19:29.47,I am so happy right now.
456,00:19:31.70,00:19:31.70,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
457,00:19:42.33,00:19:42.33,   I just wish Sean would...
458,00:19:45.53,00:19:45.53, just get a backbone sometimes.
459,00:19:48.07,00:19:48.07,  It irks me the way he tried     to put it on me.
460,00:19:50.50,00:19:50.50," Like, ""I'm going to bring you,"
461,00:19:52.13,00:19:52.13," ""but you can pass it on"
462,00:19:53.40,00:19:53.40,"  to Rich if you want to,"""
463,00:19:55.93,00:19:55.93,  like he didn't want  to be the ....
464,00:19:57.77,00:19:57.77,"you know, he didn't want   to have to make the decision"
465,00:20:00.53,00:20:00.53, that was his to make.
466,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,   It's dawn   and I'm looking at the yacht
467,00:20:37.20,00:20:37.20,  and Sean's probably still sleeping.
468,00:20:40.17,00:20:40.17,  But it won't be long
469,00:20:42.10,00:20:42.10,before they come get me  for breakfast.
470,00:20:53.50,00:20:53.50,"  Rich, get your skinny   ass up here. Let's go."
471,00:20:55.70,00:20:55.70,"My skinny ass. Oh, I love it."
472,00:20:57.77,00:20:57.77," Hey, tell Sean   he's in big trouble."
473,00:21:03.23,00:21:03.23,Tell Sean he's got to deal with Wiglesworth
474,00:21:05.20,00:21:05.20,  when he gets back.
475,00:21:06.40,00:21:06.40,"Oh, that'll, that'll spoil his whole morning."
476,00:21:09.03,00:21:09.03,  Hey.
477,00:21:10.77,00:21:10.77,And she's hungry.
478,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,"KELLY: You know, it's not even the food."
479,00:21:21.97,00:21:21.97,I don't give a ... about the food.
480,00:21:23.63,00:21:23.63,It's the point that
481,00:21:24.77,00:21:24.77,he's been going on and on and on...
482,00:21:27.03,00:21:27.03,SUSAN: About how he screwed you out of a meal.
483,00:21:28.83,00:21:28.83,   How he screwed me    and he owes me.
484,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,"  And then when it comes down to it, he can't even ..."
485,00:21:34.43,00:21:34.43,"he's a ..., man."
486,00:21:36.03,00:21:36.03, So where's Sean at?
487,00:21:41.00,00:21:41.00,RICHARD: Hey!
488,00:21:42.77,00:21:42.77,  There he is.
489,00:21:43.77,00:21:43.77,"Hey, captain."
490,00:21:44.93,00:21:44.93,I take it it's captain.
491,00:21:46.37,00:21:46.37," That's his captain,  all right."
492,00:21:48.00,00:21:48.00,Did you have a good night?
493,00:21:49.73,00:21:49.73, SEAN:    I know you needed something
494,00:21:51.47,00:21:51.47,to pull you out    of your doldrums.
495,00:21:53.07,00:21:53.07,"This is going to do it, buddy."
496,00:21:58.43,00:21:58.43,  Off we go.
497,00:21:59.80,00:21:59.80,"Sean, hey."
498,00:22:01.27,00:22:01.27,Nice shower and everything.
499,00:22:02.90,00:22:02.90,My pleasure.
500,00:22:03.90,00:22:03.90,Good to see you.
501,00:22:04.97,00:22:04.97,Meet the captain.
502,00:22:06.10,00:22:06.10,"  How are you   doing, sir?"
503,00:22:07.20,00:22:07.20,"He's also known as Jim Kenniff, my father."
504,00:22:09.57,00:22:09.57,That's my father from New York.
505,00:22:11.47,00:22:11.47,It's not!
506,00:22:12.67,00:22:12.67," Jim, all right!"
507,00:22:13.87,00:22:13.87,Isn't that wild?
508,00:22:15.57,00:22:15.57, Holy Moses!
509,00:22:16.77,00:22:16.77,  It was good.
510,00:22:17.87,00:22:17.87,   It was enjoyable.
511,00:22:19.33,00:22:19.33,   I just kept eating    while they talked
512,00:22:21.03,00:22:21.03, and answered questions   as I chewed.
513,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,  JIM:   It was rocking for me.
514,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,  SEAN:   We had an hour   boat ride here
515,00:22:26.47,00:22:26.47,and then we polished off two bottles of wine.
516,00:22:29.20,00:22:29.20,   We confessed how much    we loved each other
517,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,and all that good father-son stuff.
518,00:22:33.07,00:22:33.07,"  Oh, my God."
519,00:22:34.57,00:22:34.57,   Just dump it out.
520,00:22:35.57,00:22:35.57, This is all
521,00:22:36.93,00:22:36.93,your guys' food.
522,00:22:38.10,00:22:38.10, What is this?  Cinnamon rolls?
523,00:22:39.60,00:22:39.60,Yes.
524,00:22:41.20,00:22:41.20,"Thanks for picking me, Sean."
525,00:22:42.50,00:22:42.50,Cheers.
526,00:22:43.53,00:22:43.53,Cheers.
527,00:22:44.53,00:22:44.53,"Nice to meet you, Dad."
528,00:22:45.83,00:22:45.83,No worries.
529,00:22:53.73,00:22:53.73, SUSAN:  Six more days of rice.
530,00:22:57.83,00:22:57.83, I might even skip the last day   of eating altogether
531,00:23:01.43,00:23:01.43, just not to eat rice.
532,00:23:09.53,00:23:09.53, Mexican food.
533,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,   Shrimp fajitas...
534,00:23:15.37,00:23:15.37,chips and salsa.
535,00:23:17.70,00:23:17.70,  Guacamole...
536,00:23:20.77,00:23:20.77,and enchiladas.
537,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,"COLLEEN:    Sean is seeing that he's    in a little bit of trouble,"
538,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50, and he should probably    have Rich out there
539,00:23:28.57,00:23:28.57, because Rich is going   to make sure
540,00:23:30.33,00:23:30.33, that I get booted off tonight   and not him.
541,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,Maybe somewhere   he's thinking that.
542,00:23:34.63,00:23:34.63,   He's smart  if he's thinking that.
543,00:23:36.47,00:23:36.47,  I like that.
544,00:23:37.60,00:23:37.60,"Good job, Sean."
545,00:23:38.63,00:23:38.63, I can't figure out why
546,00:23:40.33,00:23:40.33,"he switched at the last minute,"
547,00:23:42.63,00:23:42.63,  but all them ladies  are pissed off at him.
548,00:23:45.77,00:23:45.77,   Rich had better    made a haul back.
549,00:23:56.57,00:23:56.57,"  Jeff, literally..."
550,00:23:58.27,00:23:58.27, I have so much    to tell you guys.
551,00:24:00.93,00:24:00.93,   I am definitely getting...
552,00:24:03.27,00:24:03.27,"   Oh, you all right?"
553,00:24:04.73,00:24:04.73,You all right?
554,00:24:05.90,00:24:05.90,I got caught in the rope.
555,00:24:08.33,00:24:08.33,  Six out of six   votes tonight.
556,00:24:11.03,00:24:11.03,"Unless you came back with something,"
557,00:24:12.57,00:24:12.57, we don't care  if you're back.
558,00:24:13.97,00:24:13.97,"This is my father, guys."
559,00:24:15.63,00:24:15.63,What?
560,00:24:16.77,00:24:16.77,"Rudy, come on over here."
561,00:24:18.20,00:24:18.20,  Sean's father.
562,00:24:19.60,00:24:19.60,( laughing )
563,00:24:21.50,00:24:21.50,   SEAN:    I have so much    to tell you guys.
564,00:24:24.00,00:24:24.00,Maybe we could tell him
565,00:24:25.57,00:24:25.57,how dumb you were not to take Kelly with when you owed her.
566,00:24:29.03,00:24:29.03,He's catching food for everybody.
567,00:24:30.87,00:24:30.87,Pay back your debts before you...
568,00:24:32.80,00:24:32.80, Hi.
569,00:24:33.80,00:24:33.80,Colleen.
570,00:24:34.87,00:24:34.87,Colleen.
571,00:24:36.10,00:24:36.10,Sue.
572,00:24:37.20,00:24:37.20,"Hi, Sue."
573,00:24:38.37,00:24:38.37,  Kelly.
574,00:24:39.67,00:24:39.67,  He's provided food   for us 50 times.
575,00:24:41.40,00:24:41.40,"  When Sean's dad first came,   to the tell you the truth,"
576,00:24:44.53,00:24:44.53,I almost cried because I started  thinking about my mom
577,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53, and I miss her a lot.
578,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,"  You know, Sean just gets  all the breaks."
579,00:24:52.40,00:24:52.40,"But, uh, you know, it was good."
580,00:24:54.80,00:24:54.80, I felt happy for him
581,00:24:56.27,00:24:56.27,"  and he is the family kid,     you know."
582,00:24:58.30,00:24:58.30,"  So, it was good for him."
583,00:24:59.97,00:24:59.97,  It was nice to have   a new face around and stuff.
584,00:25:01.77,00:25:01.77,Never caught a fish?
585,00:25:03.13,00:25:03.13,  Never caught a fish.
586,00:25:04.33,00:25:04.33,Superpole 2000.
587,00:25:05.57,00:25:05.57,JIM: And nothing has been happening in the news.
588,00:25:08.53,00:25:08.53, I know you're all  wondering what's...
589,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,There's nothing.
590,00:25:11.97,00:25:11.97,  SUSAN:   What's the stock   market been doing?
591,00:25:13.10,00:25:13.10,  Staying steady   or going up?
592,00:25:14.30,00:25:14.30,"Oh, no."
593,00:25:15.30,00:25:15.30,We had some bad days there.
594,00:25:16.57,00:25:16.57,Did you?
595,00:25:17.67,00:25:17.67,400 and something points on the NASDAQ.
596,00:25:19.53,00:25:19.53,  SUSAN:   What's it down to?
597,00:25:21.47,00:25:21.47,   JIM:    Then it bounced up...    I haven't...
598,00:25:23.57,00:25:23.57,"  the last few days,   I don't know."
599,00:25:25.67,00:25:25.67,"   Actually, for him to come    and visit the camp"
600,00:25:27.73,00:25:27.73,"   was sort of cool,   but he didn't know anything."
601,00:25:29.73,00:25:29.73,So that war over in Russia
602,00:25:31.80,00:25:31.80,   sort of    mellowed out?
603,00:25:33.00,00:25:33.00,What?
604,00:25:34.80,00:25:34.80,   They had that    one there...
605,00:25:36.10,00:25:36.10,   Chechnya.
606,00:25:37.13,00:25:37.13,I don't know.
607,00:25:38.57,00:25:38.57,"  We're like, what's going on  in the world?"
608,00:25:40.37,00:25:40.37,  He didn't know none of that.
609,00:25:42.13,00:25:42.13,  What about the   college play-offs?
610,00:25:43.70,00:25:43.70," Dad, you know   anything about that?"
611,00:25:45.20,00:25:45.20,"Oh, yeah, wait a minute."
612,00:25:46.40,00:25:46.40, Duke?
613,00:25:47.40,00:25:47.40,No.
614,00:25:48.40,00:25:48.40,Indiana?
615,00:25:49.40,00:25:49.40,No.
616,00:25:52.20,00:25:52.20,Who the hell won?
617,00:25:53.30,00:25:53.30,"See, I'm not really a sports person."
618,00:25:55.67,00:25:55.67,"Oh, he's just like Sean."
619,00:25:58.30,00:25:58.30,He's lovable but a doof.
620,00:26:01.40,00:26:01.40,   Come say good-bye    to my pop.
621,00:26:05.07,00:26:05.07,  COLLEEN:   Are you tired?
622,00:26:06.60,00:26:06.60,"Pleasure to meet you, Jim."
623,00:26:08.80,00:26:08.80, I brought something  for all of you.
624,00:26:11.50,00:26:11.50,"Oh, yeah?"
625,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,"Oh, geez."
626,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,"Oh, boy."
627,00:26:13.57,00:26:13.57,It's like Santa Claus.
628,00:26:14.87,00:26:14.87,Daddy Claus.
629,00:26:16.87,00:26:16.87, What's this  stuff?
630,00:26:18.27,00:26:18.27,This is J. Peterman hat.
631,00:26:20.30,00:26:20.30,Guess what this is?
632,00:26:22.87,00:26:22.87,   He needs clothes.
633,00:26:23.87,00:26:23.87,  Thank you.
634,00:26:24.87,00:26:24.87,   He's been smelly.
635,00:26:25.87,00:26:25.87,When he goes to leave this afternoon
636,00:26:27.97,00:26:27.97,"an hour and a half ago, he has this gray bag."
637,00:26:31.30,00:26:31.30,   And in it's a care package   for each one of us.
638,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,Rich.
639,00:26:35.33,00:26:35.33,Rich.
640,00:26:37.30,00:26:37.30,  JIM:   Somebody rich.
641,00:26:39.83,00:26:39.83,Kelly.
642,00:26:41.83,00:26:41.83,"  Oh, my gosh."
643,00:26:43.83,00:26:43.83,"Oh, look at this! Oh!"
644,00:26:45.47,00:26:45.47,  ( shouting )
645,00:26:48.13,00:26:48.13," So, in it we each got    a little something"
646,00:26:49.83,00:26:49.83,   from one of our loved ones from back home.
647,00:26:51.53,00:26:51.53,You got a toothbrush.
648,00:26:53.17,00:26:53.17,Thank you.
649,00:26:54.23,00:26:54.23, I don't know.
650,00:26:57.10,00:26:57.10," You know what that is,    don't you?"
651,00:26:59.67,00:26:59.67, I'm getting nauseous already.
652,00:27:06.90,00:27:06.90," SUSAN:    ""Even though we are apart,  just remember"
653,00:27:09.03,00:27:09.03,"  you are always in my heart."""
654,00:27:10.70,00:27:10.70,"COLLEEN:    We all got thrown a bone,"
655,00:27:12.70,00:27:12.70," which was amazingly,    wonderfully great,"
656,00:27:15.43,00:27:15.43," because now I feel like I can    do this for six more days,"
657,00:27:18.53,00:27:18.53,and I definitely will...
658,00:27:20.23,00:27:20.23," I'm on a sugar high right now,"
659,00:27:21.63,00:27:21.63," more than I have been   in a month,"
660,00:27:22.93,00:27:22.93, so I feel like I can  do anything right now.
661,00:27:24.87,00:27:24.87,  Thank you so much.
662,00:27:26.87,00:27:26.87,  My pleasure.
663,00:27:27.90,00:27:27.90,"Jim, thank you"
664,00:27:29.13,00:27:29.13,for being the bearer of good treasures.
665,00:27:31.30,00:27:31.30,Good meeting you all.
666,00:27:32.77,00:27:32.77,Loves you all.
667,00:27:33.77,00:27:33.77,"Pop, I love you."
668,00:27:34.90,00:27:34.90,"My son, my son, my son."
669,00:27:36.60,00:27:36.60,  Tell my mother   I love her.
670,00:27:38.23,00:27:38.23,"  Oh, I will.   I'll tell everybody."
671,00:27:39.87,00:27:39.87,Tell them I'll see them soon.
672,00:27:46.50,00:27:46.50,"Bye, Pop."
673,00:27:48.17,00:27:48.17,"   Bye, Jim!"
674,00:27:49.27,00:27:49.27,Thank you!
675,00:27:54.07,00:27:54.07,Plenty of food.
676,00:27:55.07,00:27:55.07, I don't care.
677,00:27:56.07,00:27:56.07, I'm drifting away for a while.
678,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,Just kind of going home.
679,00:27:58.97,00:27:58.97,   That's phenomenal.
680,00:28:00.47,00:28:00.47,"   God, I can't wait   to get out of here."
681,00:28:02.30,00:28:02.30, Sean's father came back    with a bag
682,00:28:04.33,00:28:04.33,"  filled with things for each  of us from particular people,"
683,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,and this made it from the most wonderful woman on the planet--
684,00:28:11.77,00:28:11.77,Valerie.
685,00:28:13.23,00:28:13.23, She just printed out    the e-mail
686,00:28:16.30,00:28:16.30,  that she was having     with her husband
687,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17, who's another incredible man--     a close friend of mine--
688,00:28:21.23,00:28:21.23,   and it just takes me back  to my real world life
689,00:28:25.77,00:28:25.77,and has my brain engaged and rejuvenated
690,00:28:29.60,00:28:29.60,and out of these
691,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10," 16, whoever they are, people,"
692,00:28:33.83,00:28:33.83,  and into who I am
693,00:28:35.30,00:28:35.30,and just knowing what's going on
694,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,   and that's it's back there
695,00:28:39.00,00:28:39.00,and what I'm about to experience  when I go back
696,00:28:42.00,00:28:42.00," and, you know,   I can last the other"
697,00:28:44.07,00:28:44.07,"whatever's left,  seven days, six days."
698,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"Hey, guys."
699,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"  Hi, Jeff!"
700,00:29:00.90,00:29:00.90, JEFF: This challenge is for immunity.
701,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87, Whoever wins gets the talisman and cannot be voted off
702,00:29:06.07,00:29:06.07,  at tonight's Tribal Council.
703,00:29:07.80,00:29:07.80,"It's all about will, this game."
704,00:29:09.60,00:29:09.60,  You're going to be   standing on planks.
705,00:29:12.10,00:29:12.10," Over a period of time,"
706,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,  I'm going to remove  certain planks
707,00:29:14.83,00:29:14.83, till we get down to one plank.
708,00:29:16.67,00:29:16.67,  Last person standing    gets the talisman
709,00:29:18.40,00:29:18.40,  and is safe tonight.
710,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,"This game could take 15 minutes,"
711,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00,it could take 15 hours.
712,00:29:22.03,00:29:22.03, You will decide that.
713,00:29:23.97,00:29:23.97,   Only rule:
714,00:29:25.70,00:29:25.70,"You can't touch anybody,"
715,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,but you can taunt all you want.
716,00:29:29.87,00:29:29.87,All right?
717,00:29:30.90,00:29:30.90,Let's go out and do it.
718,00:29:46.23,00:29:46.23,"   Survivors, ready?"
719,00:29:47.23,00:29:47.23,  ALL:  Ready.
720,00:29:48.23,00:29:48.23,Go.
721,00:29:49.30,00:29:49.30,Okay.
722,00:29:50.47,00:29:50.47,Got it.
723,00:30:16.23,00:30:16.23,Did you think somebody would be gone yet?
724,00:30:18.50,00:30:18.50,No.
725,00:30:19.93,00:30:19.93,   You know why    I'm cutting this.
726,00:30:32.60,00:30:32.60, I'm pulling  this board.
727,00:30:48.10,00:30:48.10,  ALL:    \xe2\x99\xaa ...81 bottles of beer \xe2\x99\xaa
728,00:30:51.03,00:30:51.03,  \xe2\x99\xaa You take one down   and pass it around \xe2\x99\xaa
729,00:30:53.10,00:30:53.10,  \xe2\x99\xaa 80 bottles  of beer on the wall \xe2\x99\xaa
730,00:30:54.93,00:30:54.93,  \xe2\x99\xaa 80 bottles of beer  on the wall \xe2\x99\xaa
731,00:30:57.63,00:30:57.63, \xe2\x99\xaa 80 bottles of beer \xe2\x99\xaa
732,00:30:59.80,00:30:59.80,"  \xe2\x99\xaa You take one down,   you pass it around \xe2\x99\xaa"
733,00:31:01.87,00:31:01.87,  \xe2\x99\xaa 79 bottles of beer  on the wall! \xe2\x99\xaa
734,00:31:05.07,00:31:05.07,  It's moving.
735,00:31:06.23,00:31:06.23,   I can't help that.
736,00:31:07.93,00:31:07.93,  \xe2\x99\xaa 79 bottles of beer  on the wall \xe2\x99\xaa
737,00:31:10.97,00:31:10.97, \xe2\x99\xaa 79 bottles of beer \xe2\x99\xaa
738,00:31:12.50,00:31:12.50,"  \xe2\x99\xaa You take one down, pass it around \xe2\x99\xaa"
739,00:31:14.77,00:31:14.77,  \xe2\x99\xaa 78 bottles  of beer on the wall \xe2\x99\xaa
740,00:31:16.70,00:31:16.70,  \xe2\x99\xaa 78 bottles of beer  on the wall \xe2\x99\xaa
741,00:31:19.03,00:31:19.03,   \xe2\x99\xaa 78 bottles of beer... \xe2\x99\xaa
742,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30,( yelling )
743,00:31:22.67,00:31:22.67,   JEFF:    You just gave up?
744,00:31:24.97,00:31:24.97,"  No, I fell."
745,00:31:26.33,00:31:26.33,  He couldn't take it anymore.
746,00:31:27.83,00:31:27.83,   \xe2\x99\xaa 77 Bottles of beer... \xe2\x99\xaa
747,00:31:29.40,00:31:29.40,   I slipped.
748,00:31:32.03,00:31:32.03, \xe2\x99\xaa 65 bottles of beer \xe2\x99\xaa
749,00:31:35.33,00:31:35.33,\xe2\x99\xaa You take one down... \xe2\x99\xaa
750,00:31:36.77,00:31:36.77,   \xe2\x99\xaa Pass it around \xe2\x99\xaa
751,00:31:39.37,00:31:39.37,  \xe2\x99\xaa 64 bottles of beer on the wall... \xe2\x99\xaa
752,00:31:47.27,00:31:47.27,I'm sorry to leave you
753,00:31:49.07,00:31:49.07,without my music.
754,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,   See you on shore.
755,00:31:56.57,00:31:56.57,"RICHARD: So it's ironic that Colleen is even trying,"
756,00:31:59.60,00:31:59.60,because she thinks she's dead tonight.
757,00:32:02.10,00:32:02.10,"I asked her today, ""Colleen, what makes you happy?"""
758,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,"  And she said,   ""You know, Rich,   irony makes me happy."""
759,00:32:06.73,00:32:06.73,So I think it's ironic
760,00:32:08.97,00:32:08.97,that she's trying to stay on the board
761,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,  and she's not even   in danger
762,00:32:12.47,00:32:12.47,   of getting voted off.
763,00:32:13.57,00:32:13.57,"   Kelly, on the other hand,"
764,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,  has no idea that she's   leaving this evening.
765,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,   But it's still...
766,00:32:20.20,00:32:20.20,   RUDY:    I'll bet Sean gets    two votes from the girls.
767,00:32:22.83,00:32:22.83," Yeah, Sean may get  votes from Colleen."
768,00:32:25.10,00:32:25.10,Colleen and...
769,00:32:26.83,00:32:26.83,   And maybe Kelly    just to throw a vote.
770,00:32:28.53,00:32:28.53,"Yeah, 'cause Kelly's trying to look"
771,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30,as if she's not part of the voting bloc.
772,00:32:32.37,00:32:32.37,"There they go... ooh, ooh, ooh."
773,00:32:34.00,00:32:34.00, Go! Go!
774,00:32:35.53,00:32:35.53,  Look at her.   She's almost gone.
775,00:32:37.27,00:32:37.27,"But she's Miss Dancer,"
776,00:32:39.10,00:32:39.10,  so maybe she's   got balance.
777,00:32:41.53,00:32:41.53,  He's cut one side.
778,00:32:42.60,00:32:42.60,  Now he's cut the other
779,00:32:44.03,00:32:44.03,   and they're    all wobbling.
780,00:32:45.30,00:32:45.30, Look at the wobble.
781,00:32:46.67,00:32:46.67,And the play-by-play
782,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,"  as we look at Sue,"
783,00:32:49.93,00:32:49.93,"   she's got the arms    up level across the side,"
784,00:32:51.30,00:32:51.30,"  but Kelly, holy Moses,"
785,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,  she looks like   she's going.
786,00:32:53.63,00:32:53.63," Back and forth.  Oh, no."
787,00:32:55.03,00:32:55.03,  ( Rudy chuckling )
788,00:32:56.27,00:32:56.27," RICHARD:  Colleen looking  rather stable,"
789,00:32:58.17,00:32:58.17,although determined.
790,00:32:59.77,00:32:59.77,"   Really trying to hang on,"
791,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67, thinking she's about  to be ejected this evening.
792,00:33:04.40,00:33:04.40,Sean's just as goofy as ever...
793,00:33:06.13,00:33:06.13,  and there he goes.
794,00:33:07.40,00:33:07.40,Sean falls off the board and it is down to three.
795,00:33:09.77,00:33:09.77,   Look at them.
796,00:33:11.73,00:33:11.73,"Oh, Sue!"
797,00:33:13.03,00:33:13.03, It's Kelly and Colleen.
798,00:33:14.70,00:33:14.70, Holy Moses.
799,00:33:18.73,00:33:18.73,"Okay, Sue, so if it's... if Kelly wins immunity"
800,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,   what happens?
801,00:33:25.03,00:33:25.03,Sean or Colleen?
802,00:33:27.43,00:33:27.43,I'm thinking Sean.
803,00:33:29.07,00:33:29.07,   Are you thinking Sean    before Colleen?
804,00:33:30.37,00:33:30.37,What are you thinking?
805,00:33:31.90,00:33:31.90,   I'll go with what    you guys say.
806,00:33:33.07,00:33:33.07,What do you say?
807,00:33:34.23,00:33:34.23,  I say Sean.
808,00:33:35.47,00:33:35.47, SUSAN:  Take the wisdom  of the old man.
809,00:33:37.87,00:33:37.87, Take the wisdom  of the old man.
810,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90," Rudy says Sean,"
811,00:33:41.10,00:33:41.10," so if Kelly  hangs in there,"
812,00:33:42.70,00:33:42.70,  Sean is out of   here tonight!
813,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,"   So, we've got    to watch"
814,00:33:45.40,00:33:45.40,'cause it's down to the wire.
815,00:33:51.27,00:33:51.27,You aren't cold after being out there for so long?
816,00:33:54.20,00:33:54.20,  I've got to dry off before I put clothes on.
817,00:33:56.57,00:33:56.57,"No, I'm fatter than you, remember."
818,00:33:58.47,00:33:58.47,   There goes Kelly.
819,00:33:59.47,00:33:59.47,  They're both gone.
820,00:34:00.53,00:34:00.53,"I think when one wobbles,"
821,00:34:02.30,00:34:02.30,the other wobbles.
822,00:34:03.60,00:34:03.60,"   Oh, God, Colleen."
823,00:34:05.63,00:34:05.63,This is really good.
824,00:34:21.43,00:34:21.43, Am I getting voted off    if I fall?
825,00:34:24.27,00:34:24.27,   Not by me.
826,00:34:27.00,00:34:27.00,  By the rest?
827,00:34:28.43,00:34:28.43,"   I don't know,    honey."
828,00:34:30.47,00:34:30.47,   I'm guessing yes.
829,00:34:43.97,00:34:43.97," JEFF: Kelly, you got immunity."
830,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,  JEFF:   Colleen moved.
831,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,"  SEAN:   Good job, Wiggles."
832,00:34:50.60,00:34:50.60, Whoo!
833,00:34:54.33,00:34:54.33,Well-earned.
834,00:34:56.43,00:34:56.43,   Very well-earned.
835,00:34:59.70,00:34:59.70,   Because this is so...
836,00:35:01.20,00:35:01.20,"   all you guys were    doing out there,"
837,00:35:02.60,00:35:02.60,"were saying, ""My feet are dying,   my feet are dying."""
838,00:35:05.43,00:35:05.43,  What are you wearing    to Tribal Council tonight?
839,00:35:07.63,00:35:07.63,Shoes?
840,00:35:08.70,00:35:08.70,Shoes.
841,00:35:10.20,00:35:10.20," Okay, insoles    from Dr. Scholl's."
842,00:35:11.70,00:35:11.70," Hopefully, they'll give you  a little padding on that."
843,00:35:14.60,00:35:14.60," SUSAN: Good job, Kelly."
844,00:35:16.40,00:35:16.40, KELLY:    Thank you.
845,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93, KELLY:  This stupid alliance thing--
846,00:35:29.63,00:35:29.63,"  I don't even care   about that anymore, you know?"
847,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"I say I'm not...  I'm not in it anymore,"
848,00:35:34.27,00:35:34.27,"   I'm voting my conscience,  and, you know,"
849,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,  I want to be true to myself   and who I am
850,00:35:39.27,00:35:39.27, and keep my dignity--    who cares?
851,00:35:41.23,00:35:41.23,"COLLEEN: Kelly-- she was a double agent,  so to speak, you know,"
852,00:35:44.80,00:35:44.80," talking to the Pagong people,"
853,00:35:46.47,00:35:46.47, really trying   to get in with them
854,00:35:48.13,00:35:48.13,  and then relaying everything    we said to her teammates.
855,00:35:50.87,00:35:50.87,"  The, uh, the Pagong people,   fortunately"
856,00:35:52.57,00:35:52.57,"   picked up on that, 'cause  they all came to me in unison"
857,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00," and they said, ""I think Kelly's up to no good,"""
858,00:35:57.10,00:35:57.10,"and, uh, so... so it was very plastic, very see-through,"
859,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57," and even her biggest advocate   on this island, Sue,"
860,00:36:02.53,00:36:02.53, saw right through that.
861,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00, KELLY:    I'm voting strategically.
862,00:36:05.50,00:36:05.50,"  So are they, and they still think I'm in the stupid alliance"
863,00:36:08.30,00:36:08.30," because if I told them   I didn't want to be,"
864,00:36:10.23,00:36:10.23,"   they'd vote me off, so I'm    trying to save my own ass."
865,00:36:12.53,00:36:12.53,   So how bold and wonderful is that?
866,00:36:14.50,00:36:14.50," SUSAN:    Me and Kelly, I thought,   had a real friendship going."
867,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30, I really did.
868,00:36:18.70,00:36:18.70,"  But, uh, when I turn around"
869,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,"   and see somebody starting to dig a knife into my backside,"
870,00:36:23.00,00:36:23.00, it just really pisses me off.
871,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,  I don't care  what I say to people.
872,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,  I don't care... if I'm nice   to anybody at camp anymore.
873,00:36:31.90,00:36:31.90," I do not give a ...,  and it feels so good."
874,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83," It's great, I love it."
875,00:36:47.40,00:36:47.40, Welcome to Tribal Council 11.
876,00:36:50.87,00:36:50.87,We're going to bring in our jury now.
877,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"  It consists of Greg, Jenna"
878,00:36:54.63,00:36:54.63,"and, as of last week, Gervase"
879,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,who was the last person voted off.
880,00:36:59.33,00:36:59.33,   Two of you will make    it to the final vote.
881,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,The other four will join these three
882,00:37:03.43,00:37:03.43,and will decide who gets the million dollars.
883,00:37:05.47,00:37:05.47,So let's talk about
884,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,what's gone on since the last Tribal Council.
885,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,"A busy, busy time-- a lot of it"
886,00:37:11.63,00:37:11.63,"   hovering around you, Sean."
887,00:37:13.57,00:37:13.57,"   One decision, though,    you had to make"
888,00:37:15.80,00:37:15.80," was, right as we left,    heading out to the yacht,"
889,00:37:18.13,00:37:18.13,"I said, ""you know what?  Why don't you invite somebody"
890,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,"for breakfast."""
891,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,Correct.
892,00:37:22.40,00:37:22.40,Puts you in a tough spot.
893,00:37:22.40,00:37:22.40,Very tough spot.
894,00:37:25.07,00:37:25.07,   You had to pick somebody.
895,00:37:27.90,00:37:27.90,Absolutely.
896,00:37:29.40,00:37:29.40,So what made you change  your mind at the last minute?
897,00:37:31.67,00:37:31.67,Rich provides food.
898,00:37:33.13,00:37:33.13,"KELLY: Yeah, but let's not forget the fact that you said,"
899,00:37:36.73,00:37:36.73,"   ""Kelly, all right,  I'm going to take you,"
900,00:37:38.10,00:37:38.10," ""but you can give it to Rich,"
901,00:37:39.30,00:37:39.30,"so I don't know, it's in your hands."""
902,00:37:41.27,00:37:41.27," I'll tell you why,  and she knows this."
903,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,Rich also gave us tons of food.
904,00:37:45.13,00:37:45.13,He goes out every day
905,00:37:46.30,00:37:46.30,"fishing for four hours,"
906,00:37:47.63,00:37:47.63,   comes back with something  in his basket
907,00:37:48.97,00:37:48.97," nine out of ten times,  which is really great"
908,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,for the tribe.
909,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,But you didn't say that.
910,00:37:52.23,00:37:52.23," This is what  I'm thinking, so..."
911,00:37:53.83,00:37:53.83,A day later.
912,00:37:53.83,00:37:53.83,No.
913,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,"   What do you mean,    a day later?    Not at all."
914,00:37:58.23,00:37:58.23, He was in my thoughts   when I mentioned breakfast.
915,00:38:00.43,00:38:00.43,He really wanted    to go on that ship
916,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,during the contest-- I factored all that into it
917,00:38:03.77,00:38:03.77," and I said, ""Kelly,  who wants to come?"""
918,00:38:05.43,00:38:05.43,   And I yelled from the ship
919,00:38:06.63,00:38:06.63,and I just made   an instant decision.
920,00:38:07.63,00:38:07.63,If it was the wrong one
921,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87, and it gets me a vote  from Kelly...
922,00:38:09.87,00:38:09.87,"   I'm sorry, Kelly."
923,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"It's not about the food, Sean-- it's the fact"
924,00:38:13.20,00:38:13.20,"that the whole day before, you were saying,"
925,00:38:15.13,00:38:15.13,"""Oh, I'm going to take you, and..."""
926,00:38:16.77,00:38:16.77,"I mean, you don't owe me anything."
927,00:38:18.40,00:38:18.40,It's not about that.
928,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,So...
929,00:38:19.80,00:38:19.80,It's just the fact that you were saying...
930,00:38:21.70,00:38:21.70," I felt obliged,  that's all."
931,00:38:23.13,00:38:23.13, JEFF:  Okay...
932,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,Richard.
933,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,Yeah?
934,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,"Two Tribal Councils ago, you got three votes."
935,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,Yeah.
936,00:38:28.60,00:38:28.60,The only thing
937,00:38:30.23,00:38:30.23, that saved you   was the now-infamous
938,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"  ""alphabet system,"""
939,00:38:33.90,00:38:33.90,  which cast a   vote for Jenna
940,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,was the swing vote.
941,00:38:36.70,00:38:36.70,"I mean, other people voted for Jenna,"
942,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,but it was that swing vote
943,00:38:39.80,00:38:39.80, that was based  on the alphabet  that saved you.
944,00:38:41.63,00:38:41.63,"   It looked that way, yeah."
945,00:38:42.70,00:38:42.70,"  It seems like at this point,"
946,00:38:44.37,00:38:44.37,"   if I'm just looking at it    on paper,"
947,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23,  you would be in   a very precarious   situation tonight.
948,00:38:48.10,00:38:48.10, I could be going home tonight.
949,00:38:49.57,00:38:49.57,Absolutely.
950,00:38:50.97,00:38:50.97,"  JEFF:   How about you,   Colleen?"
951,00:38:52.13,00:38:52.13,"Last Tribal Council, you said,"
952,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,"""I'm either going tonight, Jeff,"
953,00:38:55.50,00:38:55.50,"  or I'm going    the next Tribal Council."""
954,00:38:57.10,00:38:57.10," I mean, I'm feeling...    I'm feeling, uh..."
955,00:38:59.43,00:38:59.43,"  I'm feeling  like I'm going, yeah."
956,00:39:01.23,00:39:01.23,"I mean, I'm the last..."
957,00:39:03.03,00:39:03.03,I'm the last of my kind... here.
958,00:39:05.20,00:39:05.20,I'm the last Pagong.
959,00:39:06.47,00:39:06.47,"So, uh, yeah."
960,00:39:07.87,00:39:07.87,JEFF: What's your gut on how nasty it's going to get?
961,00:39:11.37,00:39:11.37,  Mm... what's my gut on how nasty it's going to get?
962,00:39:15.03,00:39:15.03,It's going to get pretty nasty.
963,00:39:17.03,00:39:17.03,"There's a lot of, uh... a lot of stuff going on."
964,00:39:20.13,00:39:20.13,"Okay, it's time to vote."
965,00:39:21.80,00:39:21.80, Rich.
966,00:39:30.37,00:39:30.37, Whoa.
967,00:39:38.13,00:39:38.13, Um...
968,00:39:40.97,00:39:40.97,   why are you going tonight?
969,00:39:42.50,00:39:42.50,Because you screwed up.
970,00:39:44.03,00:39:44.03,  It wasn't your turn.
971,00:39:45.23,00:39:45.23,"  You were supposed to stay,"
972,00:39:46.93,00:39:46.93,  so you're actually     being sacrificed
973,00:39:48.70,00:39:48.70,  even though    you were supposed to stay.
974,00:39:53.80,00:39:53.80,   But... good night.
975,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,"I can't vote for myself,"
976,00:40:12.63,00:40:12.63," so I've got to vote for Sean,"
977,00:40:14.80,00:40:14.80,"   because, uh... same reason  as last week, really."
978,00:40:19.13,00:40:19.13,  He knows. He knows.
979,00:40:30.57,00:40:30.57,   24-7 is all I have to say.
980,00:40:41.10,00:40:41.10,I'm voting for Colleen.
981,00:40:42.40,00:40:42.40,"Even though she calls me a putz  all the time,"
982,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"   I know we're good friends,  and I like her a lot."
983,00:40:46.47,00:40:46.47,   She's a cool girl.
984,00:40:47.93,00:40:47.93,"   So, I'm voting...    changing her name"
985,00:40:49.57,00:40:49.57," to ""Cooleen,"" and, uh,     she's a really cool girl."
986,00:40:52.27,00:40:52.27," I enjoyed her company,"
987,00:40:54.10,00:40:54.10,   and I'll probably see her   next vote...
988,00:40:56.27,00:40:56.27,  in the jury.
989,00:41:03.20,00:41:03.20, JEFF:   Across from you now
990,00:41:05.23,00:41:05.23,are ten torches
991,00:41:07.60,00:41:07.60, representing the first  ten people voted off.
992,00:41:09.87,00:41:09.87,  Tonight we will add  one more staff to that group.
993,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,I'll go tally the votes.
994,00:41:41.30,00:41:41.30,"  Once your votes are tallied,  the decision is final."
995,00:41:44.03,00:41:44.03,The person will be asked to leave the island immediately.
996,00:41:47.33,00:41:47.33,"   They will return, however,    to the next Tribal Council"
997,00:41:50.30,00:41:50.30,  as the fourth member    of our final jury.
998,00:41:53.63,00:41:53.63,  I'll read the votes.
