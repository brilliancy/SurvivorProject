380,00:26:13.70,00:26:13.70,GAME FOR ONE MORE CHALLENGE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING TO

408,00:27:55.60,00:27:55.60,LAURA. I JUST NEED TO MAKE A DECISION
409,00:27:56.93,00:27:56.93,AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY ONE.
410,00:28:02.17,00:28:02.17,">> THE QUESTION IS, IS IT SHAMAR OR IS IT ONE OF THEM?"
411,00:28:05.87,00:28:05.87,>> I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE--

416,00:28:27.53,00:28:27.53,AND THEY HAVE A 5-4 ADVANTAGE. >> SHAMAR RIGHT NOW IS PISSED
417,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,OFF. HE KNOWS HIS NAME IS ON THE
418,00:28:33.00,00:28:33.00,BLOCK. HE'S ONE REALIZES HE'S NOT GOING
419,00:28:35.27,00:28:35.27,HOME-- >> SHAMAR.
420,00:28:36.13,00:28:36.13,>> HE'LL CHILL OUT. MATT SAID HE WAS ON THE FENCE
421,00:28:39.33,00:28:39.33,ABOUT VOTING OUT SHAMAR. IT KIND OF GOT ME A LITTLE
422,00:28:42.23,00:28:42.23,WORRIED BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN I GO TO SLEEP TONIGHT
423,00:28:44.37,00:28:44.37,THAT SHAMAR IS SAFE LAYING NEXT TO ME.
424,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07,>> DON'T SAY ANY WORD. WHO WOULD YOU WITHOUT TALKING

428,00:29:02.73,00:29:02.73,STRATEGIC THREAT. I THINK SHE'S THE ONLY ONE OUT

430,00:29:07.07,00:29:07.07,">> SO IT'S ALLIE, UNLESS I HEAR OTHERWISE."

435,00:29:34.10,00:29:34.10,THEY'RE USUALLY UNDER A TREE.  IT'S JUST A ROCK.
436,00:29:52.30,00:29:52.30,HOLY ( BLEEP ) 3 YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
437,00:29:58.57,00:29:58.57,"ALL RIGHT, I REALLY-- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR, LIKE, NOT THAT"
438,00:30:02.03,00:30:02.03,LONG. I WAS JUST THINKING WHERE WOULD
439,00:30:04.33,00:30:04.33,I HIDE AN IMMUNITY IDOL? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TOO CRAZY.
440,00:30:11.20,00:30:11.20,"THIS IS TOO FREAKING CRAZY. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND THE"
441,00:30:18.33,00:30:18.33,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. THE IMMUNITY IDOL WILL KEEP YOU
442,00:30:22.13,00:30:22.13,"SAFE FROM BEING VOTED OFF AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."""
443,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,I WANT TO TUCK THIS THING AWAY MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY KNOWS I
444,00:30:28.67,00:30:28.67,HAVE IT. AND THAT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY
445,00:30:33.67,00:30:33.67,FREAKING NUTS THEY JUST FOUND THIS!

449,00:30:48.60,00:30:48.60,"GIANT, STUPID GRIN ON MY FACE AND A HUGE BULGE IN MY POCKET."
450,00:30:54.03,00:30:54.03,">> I'D RATHER DRINK THAN EAT, PERSONALLY, BUT I'M JUST ONE"

453,00:31:01.00,00:31:01.00,>> WE SHOULD JUST VOTE. >> LET'S JUST VOTE.
454,00:31:03.93,00:31:03.93,IT SOUNDS LIKE MORE PEOPLE ARE LEANING TOWARDS WATER.
455,00:31:09.00,00:31:09.00,">> OKAY, SO, RIGHT BEFORE WE'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR TRIBAL"
456,00:31:13.13,00:31:13.13,"COUNCIL, I SEE A BULGE IN REYNOLD'S POCKET."
457,00:31:18.40,00:31:18.40,AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN IT.
458,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD PUT IN YOUR
459,00:31:28.83,00:31:28.83,POCKET BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL IS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
460,00:31:32.20,00:31:32.20,"SO I'M, LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"
461,00:31:34.57,00:31:34.57,IS THIS GOING TO MESS UP OUR PLAN TO GET ALLIE OFF TONIGHT?
462,00:31:38.00,00:31:38.00,BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT ALLIE AND REYNOLD ARE REALLY CLOSE AND
463,00:31:40.97,00:31:40.97,THERE'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD PASS IT TO HER AND
464,00:31:45.07,00:31:45.07,"SAVE HER BUTT, AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET HER OFF."
465,00:31:47.30,00:31:47.30,"AND IF HE PASSED THAT IDOL TO ALLIE, THEN IT WOULD BE SHAMAR"
466,00:31:50.73,00:31:50.73,"GOING HOME AND NOT ALLIE, AND THAT WOULD SCREW US OVER."
467,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS.
468,00:31:57.70,00:31:57.70,"BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO TALK"
469,00:32:00.07,00:32:00.07,TO THE REST OF OUR ALLIANCE. SO I'M FREAKING OUT A LITTLE
470,00:32:04.17,00:32:04.17,BIT. >> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
471,00:32:27.33,00:32:27.33,A TORCH. GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

477,00:32:50.07,00:32:50.07,FEND FOR YOURSELVES IN A MILLION-DOLLAR GAME WITH PEOPLE
478,00:32:53.87,00:32:53.87,YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MUCH IN COMMON?
479,00:32:56.70,00:32:56.70,">> WELL, MATT, AND SHERRI HAVE FAMILIES IN COMMON."
480,00:33:00.73,00:33:00.73,THEY'RE MARRIED AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN.
481,00:33:01.93,00:33:01.93,AND THEN THERE'S THE FOURSOME. EDDIE AND HOPE AND ALLIE AND
482,00:33:07.57,00:33:07.57,"REYNOLD. >> Jeff: SO, ALLIE, DID YOU"
483,00:33:10.60,00:33:10.60,GUYS JUST QUICKLY BECOME FAST FRIEND THE FOUR OF YOU?

487,00:33:19.80,00:33:19.80,IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED. IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD DO ON

489,00:33:25.73,00:33:25.73,TAKE ON THE FOUR? >> EDDIE AND HOPE SEEM LIKE A
490,00:33:29.07,00:33:29.07,COUPLE AND THESE TWO SEEM PART OF THE FOURSOME.
491,00:33:31.70,00:33:31.70,">> Jeff: MATT, CONCERN YOU AT ALL THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE"

495,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,MAYBE IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THEM THAN THE SHELTER.
496,00:33:44.30,00:33:44.30,"BUT I'M NOT, LIKE, MAJORLY CONCERNED, NO."
497,00:33:47.90,00:33:47.90,">> Jeff: SHAMAR, HOW HAS THIS EXPERIENCE BEEN FOR YOU?"

521,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,CRITIQUES OF HOW EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR JOB AND SHAMAR KIND
522,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,OF SITS IN THE SHELTER ALL DAY WHILE WE'RE ALL SWEATING AND
523,00:35:03.33,00:35:03.33,COVERED IN CUTS AND RASHES. THAT'S WHERE THE FRUSTRATION
