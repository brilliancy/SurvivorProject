6,00:00:13.12,00:00:13.12,to save himself. >> I narced out Scout and Twila.
7,00:00:16.21,00:00:16.21,It's gonna be a mess. >> PROBST: And then there were

14,00:00:34.92,00:00:34.92,">> I've got to say good-bye, buddy."
15,00:00:36.21,00:00:36.21,">> PROBST: ""Grapefruit"" is right."
16,00:00:38.25,00:00:38.25,Eliza won reward. Nice job.
17,00:00:41.08,00:00:41.08,"And then got a big surprise. Come on out, Susan."
18,00:00:43.46,00:00:43.46,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: It's not a one-hour"
19,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83,chat. It's an overnight chat.
20,00:00:49.33,00:00:49.33,>> PROBST: Back at camp... >> There's our shelter.
21,00:00:51.75,00:00:51.75,>> PROBST: ...while Eliza enjoyed her mom's company...
22,00:00:53.75,00:00:53.75,">> Oh, it looks great. >> PROBST: ...Leann confronted"
23,00:00:57.25,00:00:57.25,Scout about scheming with the guys.
24,00:00:58.50,00:00:58.50,">> It was Chad's idea, and that is the God's honest truth."
25,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,">> PROBST: The next morning, Eliza's mom departed."
26,00:01:06.29,00:01:06.29,>> ALL: Bye. >> It doesn't matter.
27,00:01:09.42,00:01:09.42,My heart has stayed true. >> PROBST: And Twila made a bold
28,00:01:12.62,00:01:12.62,move to gain Ami and Leann's trust.
29,00:01:14.54,00:01:14.54,">> On my son, I swear... I swore on my son's name that I"
30,00:01:19.58,00:01:19.58,"was with them 100%, but maybe, if I won a million dollars,"
31,00:01:24.25,00:01:24.25,God would forgive me. >> PROBST: Immunity-- back up
32,00:01:27.25,00:01:27.25,for grabs. At the immunity challenge...
33,00:01:28.42,00:01:28.42,Come on in. ...the loved ones returned to
34,00:01:30.71,00:01:30.71,participate. Survivors ready...
35,00:01:33.67,00:01:33.67,go! Knowing he was on the chopping
36,00:01:35.33,00:01:35.33,"block, Chris gave it his all. But in a tight race, Ami and her"
37,00:01:42.04,00:01:42.04,partner solved the puzzle first. Ami wins immunity.
38,00:01:48.46,00:01:48.46,"Back at camp, the tide changed..."
39,00:01:50.38,00:01:50.38,>> Chris deserves to stay. >> PROBST: ...when the women's
40,00:01:53.46,00:01:53.46,alliance agreed to oust Eliza before Chris.
41,00:01:56.88,00:01:56.88,>> Think about it. >> PROBST: But Twila approached
42,00:01:59.00,00:01:59.00,Chris with a different plan... >> PROBST: ...one that would
43,00:02:03.67,00:02:03.67,uproot Ami's powerful alliance of women.
44,00:02:06.12,00:02:06.12,>> I'll turn the tide. I'll take the risk right now.
45,00:02:08.12,00:02:08.12,">> PROBST: With Tribal Council looming, Chris told Eliza the"
46,00:02:11.21,00:02:11.21,women's alliance turned on her and he offered her an
47,00:02:14.62,00:02:14.62,opportunity to save herself. >> But I don't trust Scout
48,00:02:17.12,00:02:17.12,and Twila. That's what scares me.
49,00:02:18.04,00:02:18.04,">> Just please take this risk. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
50,00:02:22.83,00:02:22.83,Twila and Chris' plan worked. Eliza joined them in voting out
51,00:02:27.00,00:02:27.00,"Leann. Leann, the tribe has spoken."
52,00:02:31.25,00:02:31.25,The all-women's alliance and Ami's power position had
53,00:02:34.62,00:02:34.62,"finally fallen apart. Nine days left, this game has"
54,00:02:39.71,00:02:39.71,just been turned on its head. Six are left.
55,00:02:42.46,00:02:42.46,Who will be voted out tonight? ( theme song playing )
56,00:03:59.21,00:03:59.21,>> All I can say was that was a really nice move.
57,00:04:02.67,00:04:02.67,">> I felt like we was going to get all screwed over, so I"
58,00:04:05.08,00:04:05.08,felt like I'd take up for the little guy.
59,00:04:06.54,00:04:06.54,">> ""Take up for the little guy."" That's cute."
60,00:04:08.50,00:04:08.50,"Well, you're taking up for your own guy, not for the little guy."
61,00:04:10.75,00:04:10.75,You're the one who made the four-way alliance.
62,00:04:13.33,00:04:13.33,"""Yeah, I'm down, totally all the way."
63,00:04:15.54,00:04:15.54,"Yeah, I'm in."" >> Screwed you, didn't it?"
64,00:04:17.04,00:04:17.04,>> You didn't screw me. I'm still in the game.
65,00:04:19.17,00:04:19.17,"You screwed Leann. I'm still here, baby, kicking"
66,00:04:20.62,00:04:20.62,hard. >> The bitterness started
67,00:04:23.54,00:04:23.54,as soon as we got back to camp. I'm living with five wildcats
68,00:04:27.21,00:04:27.21,right now. It's gonna be good.
69,00:04:29.38,00:04:29.38,>> You're always trying to keep Eliza in it just for your
70,00:04:32.12,00:04:32.12,benefit to go forward. >> It's all of a sudden
71,00:04:34.08,00:04:34.08,"convenient for you to want to keep Eliza in when before, every"
72,00:04:37.12,00:04:37.12,"single vote, you guys were like, ""Let's get rid of Eliza, let's"
73,00:04:39.42,00:04:39.42,"get rid of Eliza."" >> I know, but who saved"
74,00:04:40.71,00:04:40.71,"my ass tonight, when I was really going to go home."
75,00:04:42.25,00:04:42.25,">> Honey, you've been really about ready to go home..."
76,00:04:43.54,00:04:43.54,">> Me, me. >> ...nine million times."
77,00:04:52.08,00:04:52.08,"I'm sorry, that's the truth of my life, that I'm pretty happy."
78,00:04:54.08,00:04:54.08,>> You're putting Twila down. >> Twila put herself down.
79,00:04:58.17,00:04:58.17,I didn't swear on my family members.
80,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,I'm disappointed in Twila. Promising on her son's life just
81,00:05:04.50,00:05:04.50,kind of disgusts me. I lost all respect for Twila.
82,00:05:08.25,00:05:08.25,I don't know if I could ever have respect for that woman
83,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,"again. >> The only thing, and"
84,00:05:12.25,00:05:12.25,"I'll be honest with you... >> Ooh, I'm listening, big ears."
85,00:05:14.25,00:05:14.25,"What? >> Well, that's the thing"
86,00:05:15.96,00:05:15.96,right there. You and Leann and Julie thought
87,00:05:18.12,00:05:18.12,you all was so friggin' high and mighty.
88,00:05:20.29,00:05:20.29,>> High and mighty? >> You're dang right.
89,00:05:25.54,00:05:25.54,You're dang right. We've overthrown the queen and
90,00:05:29.79,00:05:29.79,the little princess. People like that just piss me
91,00:05:32.00,00:05:32.00,off because they think they are so much better than every
92,00:05:34.46,00:05:34.46,freakin' body else. We've got the power.
93,00:05:36.42,00:05:36.42,"Chris, I, Scout, we have the power now."
94,00:05:40.38,00:05:40.38,I have a great mind sometimes. I love it.
95,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,">> Ami, you're cocky. >> I'm cocky."
96,00:05:47.42,00:05:47.42,"I'm also one of the most giving, loving, caring people."
97,00:05:49.96,00:05:49.96,It's a nice balance. I'm competing with all my heart
98,00:05:53.58,00:05:53.58,now. I've got no cushions.
99,00:05:55.92,00:05:55.92,I've got no buddy to rely on. It's me all the way.
100,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,>> Underwater. Water's women.
101,00:06:17.25,00:06:17.25,"I want this so bad. I got mail, and it's gonna"
102,00:06:21.58,00:06:21.58,"be a good one. ""Today you'll push your limits"
103,00:06:25.75,00:06:25.75,"of swimming, balance and diving. A test of will and stamina for"
104,00:06:29.79,00:06:29.79,the last six still surviving. A game-changing reward with
105,00:06:33.17,00:06:33.17,"rejuvenating power, fuel for your body, fuel for your soul"
106,00:06:38.04,00:06:38.04,"and a hot, relaxing shower."" >> Thank God."
107,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,>> I need fuel for my soul. >> We're all hungry.
108,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,We all want food. I'm just praying Eliza wins
109,00:06:48.96,00:06:48.96,because Eliza looks like a little stick girl.
110,00:06:51.88,00:06:51.88,I've been calling her Olive Oyl. >> I'm starving to death.
111,00:06:56.04,00:06:56.04,You better take me in if you win the reward.
112,00:06:58.12,00:06:58.12,"You better take me, Twila. >> She needs to win."
113,00:07:12.75,00:07:12.75,">> No way. >> Oh, my."
114,00:07:18.12,00:07:18.12,">> That's a nice car. >> PROBST: Well, rather than"
115,00:07:22.83,00:07:22.83,"just tell you about your reward, I thought I'd drive it over."
116,00:07:25.33,00:07:25.33,( whoops ) >> Nice.
117,00:07:27.33,00:07:27.33,>> PROBST: For the winner of today's challenge an all-new
118,00:07:29.67,00:07:29.67,"Pontiac G-6... >> Oh, my God!"
119,00:07:32.12,00:07:32.12,">> PROBST: ...panoramic roof, remote start, good-looking car."
120,00:07:37.21,00:07:37.21,That's just part of what you're playing for.
121,00:07:39.88,00:07:39.88,"The winner of this challenge, plus the person who finishes"
122,00:07:42.96,00:07:42.96,second and the person who finishes third will leave in
123,00:07:45.96,00:07:45.96,this car. You'll drive to a Vanuatu
124,00:07:48.17,00:07:48.17,"ocean-side resort to get a hot shower, go down to the beach"
125,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,"and have some cocktails and then when you're ready, you'll have"
126,00:07:55.12,00:07:55.12,"dinner, and because I want you to know exactly what you're"
127,00:07:58.46,00:07:58.46,"playing for, I have the actual menu from the restaurant."
128,00:08:04.71,00:08:04.71,>> ALL: Oh... >> Garlic bread.
129,00:08:07.04,00:08:07.04,>> PROBST: You can have as many items as you want.
130,00:08:09.08,00:08:09.08,You can eat until the restaurant closes...
131,00:08:10.75,00:08:10.75,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: And then you'll get a"
132,00:08:13.54,00:08:13.54,good night's sleep on a comfortable bed and come back in
133,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,the morning. Worth playing for?
134,00:08:17.12,00:08:17.12,>> Yes. >> PROBST: All right.
135,00:08:18.21,00:08:18.21,Let's get to the challenge. You're going to start on the
136,00:08:21.21,00:08:21.21,beach. You'll swim out and race across
137,00:08:23.71,00:08:23.71,"a series of outrigger canoes, floating platforms and balance"
138,00:08:26.75,00:08:26.75,beams. When you get to the end of the

143,00:08:40.00,00:08:40.00,overnight reward. Let's hit it.
144,00:08:45.04,00:08:45.04,"For reward... Survivors, ready? Go!"
145,00:08:57.58,00:08:57.58,"Ami, Chris, Twila, Eliza, first up on the obstacle course."
146,00:09:03.21,00:09:03.21,Twila goes in. Scout giving it everything she
147,00:09:08.71,00:09:08.71,has. Ami first in to dive for her

154,00:09:47.67,00:09:47.67,"Eliza, Chris, Julie, right on her tail."
155,00:09:50.04,00:09:50.04,Twila has her first flag. She's heading back.
156,00:09:53.75,00:09:53.75,"Ami back with her first flag, Eliza right behind, Chris on"
157,00:09:57.21,00:09:57.21,her tail. Julie still in it.
158,00:09:59.08,00:09:59.08,Twila having a heck of a time getting back.

166,00:10:41.21,00:10:41.21,time. Julie and Chris battling for
167,00:10:43.12,00:10:43.12,that third spot. Ami still in the lead and the
168,00:10:47.12,00:10:47.12,"woman who wouldn't quit, Scout, making her way back."
169,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50,Ami falls in. Eliza closing the gap.
170,00:10:59.54,00:10:59.54,"Ami back in, going for her third and final flag."
171,00:11:02.79,00:11:02.79,Eliza right behind. ( gasping )

175,00:11:24.62,00:11:24.62,"course. Chris and Ami playing chicken,"
176,00:11:28.04,00:11:28.04,Eliza passes Ami. It's between Eliza and Ami.
177,00:11:32.12,00:11:32.12,Ami back in the water. Takes a hard fall.
178,00:11:35.25,00:11:35.25,It is Eliza's challenge to win if she can finish.
179,00:11:42.21,00:11:42.21,"With that, Eliza is going to win the Pontiac G-6."
180,00:11:46.21,00:11:46.21,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Nice job."
181,00:11:49.88,00:11:49.88,Ami finishes second. She'll be going on the reward
182,00:11:52.71,00:11:52.71,with Eliza. It's coming down to Chris
183,00:11:54.58,00:11:54.58,and Julie. >> PROBST: Chris and Julie both
184,00:12:14.17,00:12:14.17,out of the water at the same time.
185,00:12:16.25,00:12:16.25,Both worn out. Both want to eat.
186,00:12:20.83,00:12:20.83,Julie falls in the water. Chris stays on the course.
187,00:12:25.08,00:12:25.08,He has the lead. Julie is going to have
188,00:12:27.00,00:12:27.00,to catch up. Chris goes in the water.
189,00:12:29.79,00:12:29.79,"Now Julie can make up time. Julie and Chris dead even,"
190,00:12:33.38,00:12:33.38,looking for that last spot on the overnight reward.
191,00:12:38.46,00:12:38.46,It's down to Chris and Julie and they are dead even going into
192,00:12:41.21,00:12:41.21,the water. >> Come on.
193,00:12:43.88,00:12:43.88,>> PROBST: They are neck and neck.
194,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50,">> Push, push, push. ( all shouting )"
195,00:12:50.83,00:12:50.83,">> PROBST: Chris, the third place finisher, going on the"
196,00:12:54.12,00:12:54.12,overnight reward. Great effort.
197,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,"Eliza, Pontiac G-6 is yours. >> I can't believe that."
198,00:13:01.67,00:13:01.67,>> PROBST: The overnight reward is for all three of you.
199,00:13:04.42,00:13:04.42,The keys are waiting. They're in the ignition.
200,00:13:06.29,00:13:06.29,"Have a good trip. >> Good job, Eliza."
201,00:13:11.12,00:13:11.12,">> PROBST: All right, guys. Head on back to camp."
202,00:13:17.88,00:13:17.88,"( cheers ) >> Oh, yeah!"
203,00:13:30.50,00:13:30.50,">> This is sweet, isn't it? >> Yeah."
204,00:13:33.21,00:13:33.21,"Good job, Eliza. >> I won the car."
205,00:13:37.88,00:13:37.88,I don't think that's sunk in yet.
206,00:13:39.33,00:13:39.33,I still can't really believe that.
207,00:13:41.12,00:13:41.12,It was gorgeous. We had the windows open.
208,00:13:43.21,00:13:43.21,The sunroof was open. It was just amazing.
209,00:13:49.62,00:13:49.62,>> Look at how beautiful the beach is.
210,00:13:52.12,00:13:52.12,">> Oh, my gosh. >> This is paradise."
211,00:13:53.46,00:13:53.46,">> Yes, it is. >> Hello, welcome."
212,00:13:55.83,00:13:55.83,>> Hi. >> This is our bungalow.
213,00:14:01.04,00:14:01.04,">> There you are. >> Oh, a bed and pillows."
214,00:14:06.54,00:14:06.54,>> Here are our robes. It was just wonderful.
215,00:14:09.58,00:14:09.58,They told us to put our clothes in this hamper and they would
216,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33,wash them for us. >> Toilet paper!
217,00:14:15.12,00:14:15.12,>> Sounds lovely. And then we just decided to take
218,00:14:18.04,00:14:18.04,a shower immediately because we had to take off all our clothes
219,00:14:20.08,00:14:20.08,anyhow. >> I washed my hair two times
220,00:14:23.12,00:14:23.12,and scrubbed every part of my body.
221,00:14:26.29,00:14:26.29,I actually feel human again. I smell good.
222,00:14:30.17,00:14:30.17,"Oh, it's heaven. >> We all got to shower."
223,00:14:33.96,00:14:33.96,They didn't leave me no hot water.
224,00:14:35.79,00:14:35.79,Bitches. >> I don't... I can't
225,00:14:39.50,00:14:39.50,"even describe it. >> No, it's heaven."
226,00:14:41.83,00:14:41.83,">> Oh, my God. >> I'm really sorry that I"
227,00:14:43.42,00:14:43.42,voted for you. >> I know.
228,00:14:45.12,00:14:45.12,>> I really should have trusted in you a lot more than I
229,00:14:47.21,00:14:47.21,did and I'm really sorry. >> It's okay.
230,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,>> I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
231,00:14:52.25,00:14:52.25,>> I forgive you. >> I'm sad that I got
232,00:14:54.71,00:14:54.71,"pulled into Scout and Twila's, like, nastiness towards you."
233,00:14:59.00,00:14:59.00,It makes me sad. The fact that Scout keeps
234,00:15:01.25,00:15:01.25,"talking down to me, I don't appreciate very much."
235,00:15:03.46,00:15:03.46,">> I'm used to it. She stopped talking down to me,"
236,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,"oh, about yesterday when she needed my vote."
237,00:15:10.42,00:15:10.42,">> Hi, handsome. >> I am clean."
238,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,">> Oh, doesn't it feel good? >> I didn't want to get out."
239,00:15:15.33,00:15:15.33,>> The reward was beautiful. We sat out by the ocean in
240,00:15:18.79,00:15:18.79,"robes, like Hugh Heffner-- drink in hand, hors d'oeuvres."
241,00:15:22.50,00:15:22.50,( moans ) Mm... >> I have a feeling we're going
242,00:15:25.04,00:15:25.04, to be making that sound a lot tonight.
243,00:15:27.67,00:15:27.67,"Oh, my God. We get entertainment."
244,00:15:29.46,00:15:29.46,>> It's a band. Some Vanuatu people came out and
245,00:15:33.25,00:15:33.25,"sang to us, and they were dressed in vibrant orange with"
246,00:15:37.08,00:15:37.08,"big smiles on their faces, it was beautiful."
247,00:15:40.04,00:15:40.04,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Vanuatu You look so green and lovely
248,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,"Beautiful beds, \xe2\x99\xaa Beautiful beach,"
249,00:15:48.17,00:15:48.17,Lovely restaurants and resort... \xe2\x99\xaa
250,00:15:50.96,00:15:50.96,>> The best reward ever. It was totally out of a dream.
251,00:15:54.38,00:15:54.38,"I mean, all of us, we just couldn't wipe the smiles off our"
252,00:15:56.88,00:15:56.88,faces. ( singing )
253,00:16:01.54,00:16:01.54,( cheering ) >> That was awesome.
254,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,">> I think every time we get a water challenge, I drink"
255,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,half the damn ocean. Man... >> I wish we'd have just
256,00:16:19.29,00:16:19.29,a water challenge without everything else added to it.
257,00:16:23.96,00:16:23.96,"When I got back from that reward challenge, I was angry."
258,00:16:32.79,00:16:32.79,>> The fact that I can't physically show myself better in
259,00:16:36.08,00:16:36.08,"the game, you know, it's humiliating, because, given the"
260,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,"body that I had six years ago, I could physically outdo anybody"
261,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,that's out here right now. Eliza kicked some butt on that.
262,00:16:51.08,00:16:51.08,>> Nice car. >> Nice car.
263,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,">> I swear, I thought Ami won that."
264,00:16:55.12,00:16:55.12,I can't believe that Eliza split her butt.
265,00:16:57.62,00:16:57.62,I loved it. >> She did. I'm so glad.
266,00:16:59.88,00:16:59.88,>> So what do you think they are doing right now?
267,00:17:02.08,00:17:02.08,"No, never mind, I don't want to talk about it."
268,00:17:08.00,00:17:08.00,">> It ain't going to happen. Liza, she's solid."
269,00:17:11.25,00:17:11.25,>> Ami is going to be smooth talking Eliza tonight.
270,00:17:13.62,00:17:13.62,She will definitely be doing some maneuvering.
271,00:17:16.17,00:17:16.17,Will it work? I pray to God it don't.
272,00:17:19.38,00:17:19.38,>> I'm just so glad that she and Chris are there
273,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,together. That's going to make a
274,00:17:24.04,00:17:24.04,difference. >> I want to try a bite of
275,00:17:33.04,00:17:33.04,"yours, Chris, if you don't mind. >> Yeah, it is awesome."
276,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"We had a really good meal, ate as much as we could, just great"
277,00:17:40.96,00:17:40.96,food. I feel myself getting full.
278,00:17:44.12,00:17:44.12,I'm not stopping any time soon. >> I'm not full before
279,00:17:46.71,00:17:46.71,"dessert, that's for sure. ( laughing )"
280,00:17:49.42,00:17:49.42,"Food was unbelievable, and the company was great, too."
281,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,"I was really glad that Eliza, Chris and I had won together."
282,00:17:55.62,00:17:55.62,\xe2\x99\xaa What an interesting game it's been. \xe2\x99\xaa
283,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,"Listen, I know you guys want to get rid of me because I'm the"
284,00:18:01.92,00:18:01.92,"physical power player, I know that."
285,00:18:04.25,00:18:04.25,But something that I think would be really smart for you guys is
286,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,to break up Scout and Twila. That's something you two should
287,00:18:10.08,00:18:10.08,"talk about, but I think it'd make a better position for the"
288,00:18:12.25,00:18:12.25,two of you in the long run. Please excuse me for one second.
289,00:18:18.08,00:18:18.08,">> She's so phony! Does she think I'm stupid, you"
290,00:18:21.83,00:18:21.83,"know? She's still working Eliza,"
291,00:18:23.62,00:18:23.62,"though. She's strategizing, she's"
292,00:18:24.96,00:18:24.96,playing the game. >> It's not a bad idea to
293,00:18:27.75,00:18:27.75,break them up. We would be in the final four
294,00:18:29.83,00:18:29.83,"even if you, me and... >> Not Ami."
295,00:18:33.12,00:18:33.12,"We're pure final four, and if we change anything nothing is"
296,00:18:37.12,00:18:37.12,"guaranteed. Final four, and look at our"
297,00:18:40.04,00:18:40.04,"competition, a 60-year-old woman and Twila."
298,00:18:44.42,00:18:44.42,"I mean, why don't we just get the checks out now."
299,00:18:49.46,00:18:49.46,"I mean, you going to go cruising in your new car as soon as you"
300,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,get it? >> Yeah.
301,00:18:56.00,00:18:56.00,>> I am definitely realistic enough to keep tabs on
302,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,Eliza and comfort myself by talking to her and hear her
303,00:19:03.42,00:19:03.42,reassure me that she knows what's best for her.
304,00:19:06.46,00:19:06.46,I'm counting on the fact that Eliza is mentally strong.
305,00:19:09.58,00:19:09.58,">> How you doing, Chris? Is it comfortable?"
306,00:19:12.17,00:19:12.17,">> Yeah, I can definitely sleep out here."
307,00:19:15.17,00:19:15.17,">> Good night, Chris. >> Good night."
308,00:19:17.62,00:19:17.62,>> Good night. >> Good night.
309,00:19:19.25,00:19:19.25,"( chuckles ) >> You know what, it is ironic"
310,00:19:24.21,00:19:24.21,that Scout and Twila are the ones who've been pushing to
311,00:19:27.58,00:19:27.58,"get me voted off all along, yet neither one of them has ever"
312,00:19:31.00,00:19:31.00,picked up the pen and written my name down. Ever.
313,00:19:33.83,00:19:33.83,">> It makes me want to puke listening to you say how ""Scout"
314,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17,"and Twila have never written my name down, they are so great."""
315,00:19:40.67,00:19:40.67,>> I'm not saying they're so great.
316,00:19:42.17,00:19:42.17,"But, if it hadn't been for them, then I wouldn't be here."
317,00:19:45.46,00:19:45.46,">> You know what, if it hadn't been for me 50 million times"
318,00:19:48.25,00:19:48.25,turning the tides and letting you know what was going on.
319,00:19:51.25,00:19:51.25,>> I know. >> Every single time I had
320,00:19:53.92,00:19:53.92,"your back, every single vote I proved it."
321,00:19:57.50,00:19:57.50,>> Ami has stood up for me a lot of times.
322,00:20:00.42,00:20:00.42,"Ami has been the one to say, ""No, I don't want to vote"
323,00:20:02.75,00:20:02.75,"Eliza off. No, I'm not voting for Eliza."""
324,00:20:04.83,00:20:04.83,Ami has been like a big sister to me out here.
325,00:20:08.21,00:20:08.21,"I'm pissed at myself, at my decision..."
326,00:20:11.25,00:20:11.25,">> Honey, you don't need to be pissed at yourself."
327,00:20:13.33,00:20:13.33,">> I know, but more than anything else I just got my"
328,00:20:16.79,00:20:16.79,feelings hurt. >> We should stop talking
329,00:20:19.04,00:20:19.04,"about it, because I don't expect any miracle from you."
330,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,I should just be quiet. >> I woke up this morning
331,00:20:49.25,00:20:49.25,"and I saw Ami, Eliza and Chris walking back from the reward."
332,00:20:53.08,00:20:53.08,">> Hi, pretty. >> Mm, you smell nice."
333,00:20:56.62,00:20:56.62,"And it was great to have a new smell in camp, definitely."
334,00:21:00.67,00:21:00.67,"Especially for Chris, because Chris stinks."
335,00:21:02.67,00:21:02.67,He doesn't stink anymore. >> Yeah.
336,00:21:05.04,00:21:05.04,">> Oh, my God. >> I know, right."
337,00:21:08.12,00:21:08.12,">> Oh, gosh... Was it wonderful?"
338,00:21:10.67,00:21:10.67,>> It was. It was fun.
339,00:21:13.58,00:21:13.58,"Hey, T. >> I'm sure Ami worked on"
340,00:21:20.46,00:21:20.46,"Eliza pretty hard yesterday, trying to get her to swing a"
341,00:21:23.71,00:21:23.71,"vote their way, you know, and I am very worried about that."
342,00:21:27.12,00:21:27.12,"Ami is so pissed off at me and Scout, no telling what else she"
343,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,will do. >> Let me put your finger
344,00:21:33.25,00:21:33.25,right on it. >> I got it.
345,00:21:34.71,00:21:34.71,>> I think it's too short for you to get.
346,00:21:36.71,00:21:36.71,You got it. >> I got it.
347,00:21:39.79,00:21:39.79,>> I'm going to go get wood. >> Will you do mine?
348,00:21:57.33,00:21:57.33,>> It is annoying that they are sitting there in the beauty shop
349,00:22:01.04,00:22:01.04,"plucking hairs and we really need to gather wood, but Ami"
350,00:22:04.54,00:22:04.54,is a control freak. She likes to control her world
351,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,and everyone in it. >> She is the most jealous
352,00:22:10.50,00:22:10.50,"person I've ever met. I was thinking about it,"
353,00:22:13.62,00:22:13.62,"because, back in her day, she probably was a lot more fit and"
354,00:22:16.04,00:22:16.04,active and she thinks she could have kicked my ass.
355,00:22:18.21,00:22:18.21,>> That's a big issue for her. >> Yeah.
356,00:22:20.58,00:22:20.58,">> She's humiliated. >> Scout, I think she's"
357,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,"irritated with me for some reason, whether it's because"
358,00:22:28.96,00:22:28.96,she's older and I'm younger and I still have my body and she...
359,00:22:31.58,00:22:31.58,I don't know what it is. But after Tribal Council the
360,00:22:35.12,00:22:35.12,"other night, Scout has got me pissed off."
361,00:22:39.58,00:22:39.58,"Um, is that leftover manioc stew?"
362,00:22:41.08,00:22:41.08,I might cook some fish. >> You know what?
363,00:22:43.96,00:22:43.96,"We don't have much manioc left, and we have..."
364,00:22:45.54,00:22:45.54,">> I just brought back, like, 20 pounds of manioc."
365,00:22:48.21,00:22:48.21,Are you kidding me? I just went out hunting for food
366,00:22:50.17,00:22:50.17,all day long. >> ...on that very back
367,00:22:51.67,00:22:51.67,garden... >> You're kidding me right now.
368,00:22:53.12,00:22:53.12,You're telling me we don't have enough food for me to make
369,00:22:55.25,00:22:55.25,another pot of manioc. >> We have this much right
370,00:22:57.21,00:22:57.21,here... >> That's the funniest
371,00:22:59.21,00:22:59.21,thing I've heard all day. It's like Scout put a pile of
372,00:23:01.92,00:23:01.92,"cayenne pepper in my pants and said, ""Hey, let's dance."""
373,00:23:04.96,00:23:04.96,"Well, I'm ready to dance. I've lost all respect, all"
374,00:23:08.54,00:23:08.54,anything for Twila. But Scout hasn't been voted for
375,00:23:11.21,00:23:11.21,"once, and I think it's important she sees her name can be written"
376,00:23:14.75,00:23:14.75,"down, too, just like anybody else."
377,00:23:16.54,00:23:16.54,"The chance of Scout being in the top two makes me sick,"
378,00:23:18.92,00:23:18.92,"like, just makes me sick. >> They are a bunch of alley"
379,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,"cats going at it, and strategically, this is the"
380,00:23:26.38,00:23:26.38,best thing for me. I don't even think they're
381,00:23:28.71,00:23:28.71,"looking at me. I mean, I'm just sitting back"
382,00:23:30.38,00:23:30.38,and watching 'em shoot each other.
383,00:23:32.00,00:23:32.00,>> Get your own damn blanket. That's ours.
384,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,>> But Ami needs to go home. She's definitely a threat.
385,00:23:38.04,00:23:38.04,"I mean, we knocked her off of her horse, thank God."
386,00:23:40.92,00:23:40.92,"But who's to say she ain't to get up, dust herself off, climb"
387,00:23:43.54,00:23:43.54,back on and pull something off? >> Tree mail.
388,00:23:57.17,00:23:57.17,>> Looks like a spirit button. >> Ooh.
389,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,"""Some are faster and stronger and smarter and such, but this"
390,00:24:04.04,00:24:04.04,"time you are safe if you have the right touch."""
391,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,Ooh. >> What do you think it is?
392,00:24:10.08,00:24:10.08,">> It's gonna be balancing, something balancing"
393,00:24:12.75,00:24:12.75,something on something. >> Mm-hmm.
394,00:24:16.04,00:24:16.04,>> ( chuckles ): Another interesting challenge.
395,00:24:18.08,00:24:18.08,It's hard to tell. I have not been capable of
396,00:24:21.25,00:24:21.25,"overcoming the physical challenges against these women,"
397,00:24:24.21,00:24:24.21,so I want immunity. I'm still the only guy here.
398,00:24:27.62,00:24:27.62,I'm the only man standing. Immunity is all that's gonna
399,00:24:30.04,00:24:30.04,"make me safe. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
400,00:24:43.12,00:24:43.12,ready to get to today's challenge?
401,00:24:44.54,00:24:44.54,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: First things first.
402,00:24:46.33,00:24:46.33,"Ami, give it up. >> I don't think it'll come off."
403,00:24:49.08,00:24:49.08,It's stuck. >> PROBST: Try.
404,00:24:51.54,00:24:51.54,>> ( Ami laughs ) >> PROBST: Once again immunity
405,00:24:55.25,00:24:55.25,"back up for grabs. For today's Immunity Challenge,"
406,00:24:58.58,00:24:58.58,you're going to take part in a Survivor version of
407,00:25:00.88,00:25:00.88,shuffleboard. Represented on our board are the
408,00:25:04.25,00:25:04.25,islands of Vanuatu. You will each have five pucks.
409,00:25:07.54,00:25:07.54,Your goal: land as many of your pucks as you can on any part of
410,00:25:11.12,00:25:11.12,the different islands. You can also use them
411,00:25:13.79,00:25:13.79,defensively to knock another tribe member off of an island.
412,00:25:17.25,00:25:17.25,The only way to guarantee that once you're on an island you
413,00:25:19.88,00:25:19.88,stay there is drop it in the volcano.
414,00:25:22.00,00:25:22.00,"There that can't be knocked out. At the end of the game, the"
415,00:25:24.38,00:25:24.38,tribe member who has the most pucks touching any part of any
416,00:25:27.00,00:25:27.00,of the islands wins immunity. We'll draw numbers to determine
417,00:25:31.17,00:25:31.17,"your order, and we will get going."
418,00:25:36.17,00:25:36.17,"Okay, we have randomly drawn to determine your order."
419,00:25:39.17,00:25:39.17,"Chris, you'll go first this round."
420,00:25:44.29,00:25:44.29,Chris with his first shot. Mm.
421,00:25:48.71,00:25:48.71,"Twila, get us on the board. Eliza."
422,00:25:57.58,00:25:57.58,Trying to land on an island. That'll count.
423,00:26:02.42,00:26:02.42,">> Nice job, Eliza. >> PROBST: Ami."
424,00:26:04.46,00:26:04.46,The big island. And look at that.
425,00:26:08.92,00:26:08.92,That'll count. Julie.
426,00:26:11.33,00:26:11.33,Your first shot of the first round.
427,00:26:14.58,00:26:14.58,Julie banks and in the volcano! ( cheering )
428,00:26:17.29,00:26:17.29,Right in the volcano. Nobody can knock you out.
429,00:26:19.29,00:26:19.29,That point's gonna be safe the whole game.
430,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,Scout looking to get on the board.
431,00:26:24.33,00:26:24.33,"Aw, no love. At the end of the first round,"
432,00:26:27.62,00:26:27.62,"Eliza with one, Julie with one, and Ami with one. Twila."
433,00:26:34.42,00:26:34.42,"Oh, look at that! >> Wow."
434,00:26:36.67,00:26:36.67,>> PROBST: And that's a safe point.
435,00:26:38.08,00:26:38.08,Nobody gonna knock that out. Eliza.
436,00:26:43.33,00:26:43.33,>> Oh. >> PROBST: Ami.
437,00:26:48.62,00:26:48.62,">> Oh. >> PROBST: Oh, so close."
438,00:26:51.96,00:26:51.96,Julie looking to go in the lead. And she does.
439,00:26:56.08,00:26:56.08,>> Nice. Julie with her second point.
440,00:26:59.54,00:26:59.54,Scout. Chris.
441,00:27:06.04,00:27:06.04,Last shot of this round. Up and over.
442,00:27:11.62,00:27:11.62,"At the end of the second round, Julie with two, Ami, Eliza,"
443,00:27:15.25,00:27:15.25,Twila with one. Eliza.
444,00:27:21.88,00:27:21.88,Ami. Julie in the lead with two.
445,00:27:30.96,00:27:30.96,Nope. Scout yet to get on the board.
446,00:27:35.42,00:27:35.42,That's close. No.
447,00:27:37.38,00:27:37.38,>> Almost. >> PROBST: Chris.
448,00:27:42.33,00:27:42.33,Chris is on. Twila.
449,00:27:49.75,00:27:49.75,"At the end of three rounds, Julie with two, Chris, Ami,"
450,00:27:53.12,00:27:53.12,"Eliza, Twila with one. And she's on."
451,00:27:59.79,00:27:59.79,"Ami has her second point. Julie with two, looking to add."
452,00:28:06.21,00:28:06.21,>> Close. >> PROBST: Scout.
453,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,That'll do it! >> There you go!
454,00:28:11.54,00:28:11.54,>> PROBST: Scout is on with her first point.
455,00:28:13.62,00:28:13.62,Chris. Chris knocks Julie off and puts
456,00:28:17.83,00:28:17.83,"himself on the board. >> Yeah, there you go!"
457,00:28:20.75,00:28:20.75,>> PROBST: Chris and Ami now tied at two.
458,00:28:23.12,00:28:23.12,Julie back to one. Twila now has two.
459,00:28:26.88,00:28:26.88,>> Do it! Two! >> PROBST: Eliza needs another
460,00:28:30.25,00:28:30.25,"point to stay in it. >> Oh, I just knocked"
461,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,myself off! >> PROBST: Instead of gaining a
462,00:28:37.33,00:28:37.33,"point, Eliza just lost her only point."
463,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"At end of four rounds, Ami, Chris and Twila with two,"
464,00:28:42.92,00:28:42.92,Julie and Scout with one. Last round.
465,00:28:46.58,00:28:46.58,Julie needs another point to stay in this.
466,00:28:50.46,00:28:50.46,And instead she just puts Twila further on.
467,00:28:53.29,00:28:53.29,Scout. She's going offensively.
468,00:28:56.08,00:28:56.08,Trying to score. And she does!
469,00:28:59.96,00:28:59.96,"Scout, Twila, Chris and Ami now each with two."
470,00:29:04.83,00:29:04.83,Chris takes the lead with three. Twila with her last shot.
471,00:29:13.62,00:29:13.62,"She's just short. Eliza, you're up."
472,00:29:17.21,00:29:17.21,"No points, but you can play the role of the spoiler, and you can"
473,00:29:19.83,00:29:19.83,knock Chris off an island. >> I missed entirely.
474,00:29:26.42,00:29:26.42,>> PROBST: Not even close. One shot left. It is Ami.
475,00:29:31.62,00:29:31.62,"If she scores or knocks Chris off, we go to a tiebreaker."
476,00:29:36.58,00:29:36.58,She gonna go offense... or defense?
477,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,Ami takes herself out. Chris wins immunity!
478,00:29:51.12,00:29:51.12,>> Yes! >> Yeah!
479,00:29:53.17,00:29:53.17,">> Good job, dude. Yes. Way to go."
480,00:29:57.00,00:29:57.00,"Way to go. >> PROBST: All right, Chris,"
481,00:30:01.58,00:30:01.58,"come over here. Turn around here, I'll put"
482,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,this on you. You're safe tonight at Tribal
483,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,"Council. With only six people left,"
484,00:30:10.75,00:30:10.75,somebody is going home tonight. >> Yes.
485,00:30:12.88,00:30:12.88,>> PROBST: You have the afternoon.
486,00:30:14.17,00:30:14.17,Should be an interesting one. Head on back to camp.
487,00:30:38.46,00:30:38.46,">> Good job, Chris. >> Thank you."
488,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,Finally. >> Finally!
489,00:30:44.04,00:30:44.04,>> I won something. Today was my day.
490,00:30:48.21,00:30:48.21,I was extremely happy to win immunity.
491,00:30:51.79,00:30:51.79,It is a little bit humorous that it did take a nonphysical
492,00:30:54.54,00:30:54.54,challenge to beat the chicks. But I'm looking at it as though
493,00:30:57.50,00:30:57.50,"I've achieved something great here, and I have immunity."
494,00:30:59.96,00:30:59.96,That's all that matters right now.
495,00:31:04.33,00:31:04.33,>> Can you believe I knocked myself off?
496,00:31:06.54,00:31:06.54,>> I know. >> Today was definitely one
497,00:31:12.83,00:31:12.83,"of my weaker challenges, and it just happens to be the challenge"
498,00:31:15.29,00:31:15.29,that I needed the most. So tonight's the night.
499,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,">> You do know she's got to go, no matter what."
500,00:31:22.04,00:31:22.04,">> But, then, you're not gonna turn around and vote for me,"
501,00:31:24.12,00:31:24.12,"are you? >> No, hon. I gave you..."
502,00:31:26.00,00:31:26.00,"Well, I can't give you my word, 'cause you don't trust my word"
503,00:31:28.79,00:31:28.79,"no more. >> I know, but it's hard 'cause,"
504,00:31:30.79,00:31:30.79,"you know, you swore on your son and..."
505,00:31:32.62,00:31:32.62,">> Yeah, I did do that, and that was a mistake, and I"
506,00:31:35.50,00:31:35.50,take it back. >> But it still m...
507,00:31:37.25,00:31:37.25,">> Don't second-guess me. I swear to you, you don't have"
508,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,nothing to worry about. Us four are solid.
509,00:31:43.96,00:31:43.96,I think Ami could influence Eliza.
510,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,She's got the power. She's got the wit and the
511,00:31:49.08,00:31:49.08,power to do it. Ami has controlled this game
512,00:31:51.17,00:31:51.17,"from the second day, and she's very persuasive."
513,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,"If she hadn't have been, them other girls wouldn't have"
514,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,followed her all this time. Ami's got one day to work her
515,00:31:59.96,00:31:59.96,"magic on Eliza. I just worry, 'cause part of her"
516,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"don't want to trust me yet, you know."
517,00:32:09.38,00:32:09.38,>> Mm-hmm. But I want you to know that I
518,00:32:12.75,00:32:12.75,"feel like I've stood up for you five million times, and if then"
519,00:32:15.88,00:32:15.88,"you kind of, like, throw me off to the side at the very end of"
520,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"the game, that would hurt my feelings."
521,00:32:20.88,00:32:20.88,"It's like, whatever. Okay, so you don't give a ..."
522,00:32:24.54,00:32:24.54,then that's how the game rolls. I really thought that I could go
523,00:32:28.62,00:32:28.62,"through this game and play, like, a fair game all the way"
524,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,"through and not have to play dirty, and it just didn't"
525,00:32:34.46,00:32:34.46,work out. So I'm really vulnerable right
526,00:32:36.75,00:32:36.75,"now, and Eliza would be the only hope."
527,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,>> Is there any way they can convince her that if she
528,00:32:41.46,00:32:41.46,"comes with them, she'll have a better chance or anything?"
529,00:32:43.75,00:32:43.75,"Is there any way? >> No, because then they risk"
530,00:32:45.79,00:32:45.79,a tie. Eliza's not gonna risk no tie
531,00:32:48.12,00:32:48.12,vote. That puts her in jeopardy.
532,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,"If there is a tie, it's my understanding that everyone"
533,00:32:53.08,00:32:53.08,would have the opportunity to vote again.
534,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,"And if voting again did not break the tie, the two people"
535,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,"being voted for, I think they would get immunity, and the rest"
536,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,"of us would pull rocks, and whoever drew a colored rock"
537,00:33:09.04,00:33:09.04,goes home. So Eliza could mess things
538,00:33:11.71,00:33:11.71,"up real bad. >> Yeah. Me, too."
539,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,">> It's really going to be tough to vote for Ami, really hard,"
540,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,"because I like Ami a lot and I like Julie a lot, too."
541,00:33:28.96,00:33:28.96,I have fun with them. I connect with them.
542,00:33:31.25,00:33:31.25,They have been my friends since really early on in this game.
543,00:33:36.46,00:33:36.46,"Oh, my God, he's been off with them all day."
544,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
545,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,I just like spending time with them.
546,00:33:42.96,00:33:42.96,They're just more fun than you are.
547,00:33:44.12,00:33:44.12,">> Does she not want you to? Who are you more sick of, Scout"
548,00:33:46.54,00:33:46.54,or Twila? >> Scout.
549,00:33:47.54,00:33:47.54,>> Really? >> Yeah.
550,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> How is that fair? If it was a 3-3 vote, we just"
551,00:33:59.25,00:33:59.25,"went at Tribal, didn't mention it at all..."
552,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,">> Oh, my God, dude. >> All of a sudden, bam,"
553,00:34:03.92,00:34:03.92,"and it would be... oh, she would be so mad."
554,00:34:08.42,00:34:08.42,">> Dude, that that would be the best."
555,00:34:09.96,00:34:09.96,It would be the best thing that could happen in this game.
556,00:34:23.38,00:34:23.38,">> Feels good, doesn't it? >> Right now Scout,"
557,00:34:30.83,00:34:30.83,"Twila and Chris think I'm, you know, 100% solid in this final"
558,00:34:34.04,00:34:34.04,"four alliance, but I do have reservations because I don't"
559,00:34:37.92,00:34:37.92,think Scout or Twila will take me to the final three.
560,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,"Ami and Julie, on the other hand, would take me, so I'm not"
561,00:34:43.62,00:34:43.62,afraid to change things if I think that it's going to get me
562,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,"farther in this game. >> Oh, there you are."
563,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,"Eliza could go either way, but I have a connection with Eliza so"
564,00:34:56.88,00:34:56.88,"I know that there is something in her heart saying, ""You"
565,00:35:00.38,00:35:00.38,know what? I really would like to have Ami
566,00:35:02.79,00:35:02.79,"in the game,"" so anything could happen."
567,00:35:22.50,00:35:22.50,">> PROBST: Now bring in the jury, Sarge, Chad and Leann"
568,00:35:26.29,00:35:26.29,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
569,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,"Well, the reactions while the votes were being read at the"
570,00:35:36.04,00:35:36.04,"last Tribal went from one end to the other, from smug to absolute"
571,00:35:41.08,00:35:41.08,"shock. Ami, you were shocked."
572,00:35:43.38,00:35:43.38,">> Yeah, I was shocked. Yeah, I thought I was going to"
573,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,go home and sleep with Leann and she wasn't coming home.
574,00:35:49.46,00:35:49.46,"And once I saw her name once, I knew something was definitely"
575,00:35:53.62,00:35:53.62,"wrong in my world. >> PROBST: Scout, what is Chris"
576,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,"still doing here, because you're the one who told me ""I want the"
577,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,"women to stay strong and keep together the whole game."""
578,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,"Clearly, the women have not stayed strong."
579,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,">> Well, my desire was to find out what would happen if"
580,00:36:10.04,00:36:10.04,"the women would stay strong and would stay together, but once we"
581,00:36:12.92,00:36:12.92,"merged, several of us weren't able to play the game."
582,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,We were sitting ducks. And a position came along where
583,00:36:18.21,00:36:18.21,"a group of us could make a change in the game, so we did."
584,00:36:22.12,00:36:22.12,">> PROBST: It seems to me, you wanted the women to stick"
585,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,"together only so long as it served you and, the minute it"
586,00:36:27.33,00:36:27.33,"didn't, you would change strategy."
587,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,"There's nothing wrong with that, but, clearly, this whole women"
588,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,"power thing is over. Ami, based on the last vote, you"
589,00:36:36.83,00:36:36.83,don't seem as much a part of this right now.
590,00:36:39.50,00:36:39.50,">> I'm not any part of this anymore, and I think when"
591,00:36:41.54,00:36:41.54,somebody flat out just disgustingly lies to you and
592,00:36:45.42,00:36:45.42,"says things to you that I really can't imagine, that person to me"
593,00:36:48.58,00:36:48.58,is just written out of my life. I don't have any part of that.
594,00:36:52.04,00:36:52.04,">> May I clear that up, Jeff, thank you very much?"
595,00:36:54.54,00:36:54.54,"I did swear on my son's name and I do ask forgiveness, but I am"
596,00:36:58.04,00:36:58.04,not the only friggin' person that has lied in this game!
597,00:37:01.92,00:37:01.92,"Get over it! Grow up, get on with it."
598,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,You've been had. Screw you!
599,00:37:06.96,00:37:06.96,">> PROBST: Ami, you're laughing. >> You can lie all you want"
600,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,"and that is part of this game, but when you bring in the one"
601,00:37:12.92,00:37:12.92,thing that you say is the most sacred thing to you in the
602,00:37:15.04,00:37:15.04,"world, the only thing that matters, the only thing that"
603,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,"makes your heart really beat, and then you lie on it, to me,"
604,00:37:20.79,00:37:20.79,that is not worth a million dollars.
605,00:37:23.04,00:37:23.04,That is not worth a gazillion dollars.
606,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,"I was left sad, really sad about that."
607,00:37:29.92,00:37:29.92,">> PROBST: So, Eliza, is this a little bit of sour grapes for"
608,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,Ami with her attitude? >> I don't think it's sour
609,00:37:36.00,00:37:36.00,"grapes, because when you feel close to someone and then"
610,00:37:38.62,00:37:38.62,"they do what you feel like is backstabbing you, it hurts."
611,00:37:42.96,00:37:42.96,"Twila swore on her son, the one thing that someone would say to"
612,00:37:45.79,00:37:45.79,"convince me, oh, they must be true to their word and having a"
613,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"response to that, I think, is absolutely natural."
614,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,>> PROBST: How are you feeling about your vote last Tribal
615,00:37:54.88,00:37:54.88,"Council, when Leann was clearly hurt?"
616,00:37:58.08,00:37:58.08,>> It was awful. It was really hard.
617,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,I think that's one of the hardest aspects of this game.
618,00:38:03.62,00:38:03.62,I never imagined how close of friendships I would form here
619,00:38:08.25,00:38:08.25,and that it would really hurt to vote people off.
620,00:38:10.79,00:38:10.79,>> PROBST: Would you miss Ami if she was gone?
621,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,">> Yep, a lot. >> PROBST: What would you miss"
622,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,about her? >> Ami is the person who every
623,00:38:18.25,00:38:18.25,"time we get tree mail she turns to me and says, ""Okay,"
624,00:38:20.29,00:38:20.29,"Eliza, what's the challenge going to be?"" and I try figure"
625,00:38:22.54,00:38:22.54,"it out. And she's like, ""Oh, my God,"
626,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,you're going to be awesome at that challenge and you're just
627,00:38:27.00,00:38:27.00,"going to do great,"" and, you know, she's just-- the big"
628,00:38:30.88,00:38:30.88,"sister I never had, and, yeah, I'd miss Ami a lot."
629,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,">> Stop crying. >> PROBST: Ami, would you miss"
630,00:38:44.42,00:38:44.42,Eliza? >> AMI: I would miss Eliza
631,00:38:46.58,00:38:46.58,"a lot. I've really, really grown to"
632,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,"love Eliza. By far, she has changed more"
633,00:38:52.54,00:38:52.54,than anyone in this game. She's been willing to change.
634,00:38:56.92,00:38:56.92,She should be proud of herself. >> PROBST: And it is time to
635,00:39:03.12,00:39:03.12,"vote. Chris, you have immunity."
636,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,I can't imagine that you would want to give it up.
637,00:39:07.62,00:39:07.62,">> No, I'm not giving up immunity."
638,00:39:09.83,00:39:09.83,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Chris.
639,00:39:11.12,00:39:11.12,"Everybody else is fair game. Twila, you're up."
640,00:39:22.25,00:39:22.25,">> Drama queen to the end. >> Well, Scout, you're pretty"
641,00:39:34.33,00:39:34.33,"good at hiding your nasty side, but when your true colors come"
642,00:39:38.17,00:39:38.17,"out, they are no part of any rainbow I've ever seen."
643,00:39:47.04,00:39:47.04,">> Ami, queens get dethroned, and a lightning will strike a"
644,00:39:51.79,00:39:51.79,lone tree on top of a mountain faster than anything.
645,00:40:12.25,00:40:12.25,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
646,00:40:31.21,00:40:31.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
647,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
648,00:40:34.96,00:40:34.96,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
649,00:40:39.04,00:40:39.04,First vote Ami. Scout.
650,00:40:48.00,00:40:48.00,One vote Scout. Ami.
651,00:40:52.21,00:40:52.21,"Two votes Ami, one vote Scout. Scout."
652,00:40:58.42,00:40:58.42,"We're tied, two votes Ami, two votes Scout."
653,00:41:04.04,00:41:04.04,"Ami. That's three votes Ami, two"
654,00:41:06.75,00:41:06.75,votes Scout. I'll read the last vote.
655,00:41:13.00,00:41:13.00,"13th person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu, Ami."
656,00:41:17.04,00:41:17.04,"You can bring me your torch. >> Good luck, all you young'uns."
657,00:41:26.83,00:41:26.83,">> PROBST: Ami, the tribe has spoken."
658,00:41:34.50,00:41:34.50,"It's time for you to go. Well, tonight's Tribal Council"
659,00:41:46.42,00:41:46.42,illuminated the undeniable tension and the frayed nerves
660,00:41:50.00,00:41:50.00,that exist within this tribe after 33 days.
661,00:41:53.12,00:41:53.12,"With only six days left, it's only going to get worse."
662,00:41:56.29,00:41:56.29,Grab your torches and head back to camp.
663,00:41:58.38,00:41:58.38,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
664,00:42:17.21,00:42:17.21,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:
665,00:42:24.46,00:42:24.46,>> I am so sorry that I ever made that statement.
666,00:42:27.50,00:42:27.50,>> PROBST: Twila unleashes her dark side.
667,00:42:30.21,00:42:30.21,>> You can kiss my ass. >> Twila flipped out and
668,00:42:32.12,00:42:32.12,I'm going to completely use it against her later on.
669,00:42:35.17,00:42:35.17,">> I think you're a liar, T. I think you're a liar."
670,00:42:37.21,00:42:37.21,>> PROBST: Eliza and Twila have it out.
671,00:42:38.92,00:42:38.92,>> I'm having some fun right now.
672,00:42:40.92,00:42:40.92,"It's dangerous though. >> First off, I just have to"
673,00:42:49.17,00:42:49.17,laugh. If I could just hold Twila
674,00:42:51.08,00:42:51.08,"underwater for two minutes, I think it would make me feel"
675,00:42:53.46,00:42:53.46,"better, but I really feel my integrity is still complete, and"
676,00:42:57.25,00:42:57.25,I can't say that for all those people on the tribe still.
677,00:43:00.46,00:43:00.46,I've gained some really important friends in my life--
678,00:43:03.46,00:43:03.46,"Leann, Jules, Eliza. I love those girls."
