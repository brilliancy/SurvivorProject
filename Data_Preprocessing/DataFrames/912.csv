383,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,>> But Ami needs to go home.She's definitely a threat.
384,00:23:38.04,00:23:38.04,"I mean, we knocked her off ofher horse, thank God."
385,00:23:40.92,00:23:40.92,"But who's to say she ain't toget up, dust herself off, climb"

411,00:25:17.25,00:25:17.25,The only way to guarantee thatonce you're on an island you
412,00:25:19.88,00:25:19.88,stay there is drop it in thevolcano.

437,00:26:51.96,00:26:51.96,Julie looking to go in the lead.And she does.
438,00:26:56.08,00:26:56.08,>> Nice.Julie with her second point.

453,00:28:11.54,00:28:11.54,>> PROBST: Scout is on with herfirst point.
454,00:28:13.62,00:28:13.62,Chris.Chris knocks Julie off and puts
455,00:28:17.83,00:28:17.83,"himself on the board.>> Yeah, there you go!"
456,00:28:20.75,00:28:20.75,>> PROBST: Chris and Ami nowtied at two.
457,00:28:23.12,00:28:23.12,Julie back to one.Twila now has two.
458,00:28:26.88,00:28:26.88,>> Do it! Two!>> PROBST: Eliza needs another
459,00:28:30.25,00:28:30.25,"point to stay in it.>> Oh, I just knocked"
460,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,myself off!>> PROBST: Instead of gaining a
461,00:28:37.33,00:28:37.33,"point, Eliza just lost heronly point."
462,00:28:39.12,00:28:39.12,"At end of four rounds, Ami,Chris and Twila with two,"
463,00:28:42.92,00:28:42.92,Julie and Scout with one.Last round.
464,00:28:46.58,00:28:46.58,Julie needs another point tostay in this.
465,00:28:50.46,00:28:50.46,And instead she just puts Twilafurther on.
466,00:28:53.29,00:28:53.29,Scout.She's going offensively.
467,00:28:56.08,00:28:56.08,Trying to score.And she does!
468,00:28:59.96,00:28:59.96,"Scout, Twila, Chris and Ami noweach with two."

472,00:29:19.83,00:29:19.83,knock Chris off an island.>> I missed entirely.
473,00:29:26.42,00:29:26.42,>> PROBST: Not even close.One shot left. It is Ami.
474,00:29:31.62,00:29:31.62,"If she scores or knocks Chrisoff, we go to a tiebreaker."
475,00:29:36.58,00:29:36.58,She gonna go offense...or defense?
476,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,Ami takes herself out.Chris wins immunity!
477,00:29:51.12,00:29:51.12,>> Yes!>> Yeah!

479,00:29:57.00,00:29:57.00,"Way to go.>> PROBST: All right, Chris,"
480,00:30:01.58,00:30:01.58,"come over here.Turn around here, I'll put"
481,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,this on you.You're safe tonight at Tribal
482,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,"Council.With only six people left,"
483,00:30:10.75,00:30:10.75,somebody is going home tonight.>> Yes.
484,00:30:12.88,00:30:12.88,>> PROBST: You have theafternoon.
485,00:30:14.17,00:30:14.17,Should be an interesting one.Head on back to camp.
486,00:30:38.46,00:30:38.46,">> Good job, Chris.>> Thank you."
487,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,Finally.>> Finally!
488,00:30:44.04,00:30:44.04,>> I won something.Today was my day.
489,00:30:48.21,00:30:48.21,I was extremely happy to winimmunity.
490,00:30:51.79,00:30:51.79,It is a little bit humorous thatit did take a nonphysical
491,00:30:54.54,00:30:54.54,challenge to beat the chicks.But I'm looking at it as though
492,00:30:57.50,00:30:57.50,"I've achieved something greathere, and I have immunity."
493,00:30:59.96,00:30:59.96,That's all that mattersright now.
494,00:31:04.33,00:31:04.33,>> Can you believe Iknocked myself off?
495,00:31:06.54,00:31:06.54,>> I know.>> Today was definitely one
496,00:31:12.83,00:31:12.83,"of my weaker challenges, and itjust happens to be the challenge"
497,00:31:15.29,00:31:15.29,that I needed the most.So tonight's the night.
498,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,">> You do know she's got to go,no matter what."
499,00:31:22.04,00:31:22.04,">> But, then, you're not gonnaturn around and vote for me,"
500,00:31:24.12,00:31:24.12,"are you?>> No, hon. I gave you..."
501,00:31:26.00,00:31:26.00,"Well, I can't give you my word,'cause you don't trust my word"
502,00:31:28.79,00:31:28.79,"no more.>> I know, but it's hard 'cause,"
503,00:31:30.79,00:31:30.79,"you know, you swore on your sonand..."
504,00:31:32.62,00:31:32.62,">> Yeah, I did do that, andthat was a mistake, and I"
505,00:31:35.50,00:31:35.50,take it back.>> But it still m...
506,00:31:37.25,00:31:37.25,">> Don't second-guess me.I swear to you, you don't have"
507,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,nothing to worry about.Us four are solid.
508,00:31:43.96,00:31:43.96,I think Ami could influenceEliza.
509,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,She's got the power.She's got the wit and the
510,00:31:49.08,00:31:49.08,power to do it.Ami has controlled this game
511,00:31:51.17,00:31:51.17,"from the second day, and she'svery persuasive."
512,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,"If she hadn't have been, themother girls wouldn't have"
513,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,followed her all this time.Ami's got one day to work her
514,00:31:59.96,00:31:59.96,"magic on Eliza.I just worry, 'cause part of her"
515,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"don't want to trust me yet,you know."
516,00:32:09.38,00:32:09.38,>> Mm-hmm.But I want you to know that I
517,00:32:12.75,00:32:12.75,"feel like I've stood up for youfive million times, and if then"
518,00:32:15.88,00:32:15.88,"you kind of, like, throw me offto the side at the very end of"
519,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"the game, that would hurt myfeelings."
520,00:32:20.88,00:32:20.88,"It's like, whatever.Okay, so you don't give a ..."
521,00:32:24.54,00:32:24.54,then that's how the game rolls.I really thought that I could go
522,00:32:28.62,00:32:28.62,"through this game and play,like, a fair game all the way"
523,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,"through and not have to playdirty, and it just didn't"
524,00:32:34.46,00:32:34.46,work out.So I'm really vulnerable right
525,00:32:36.75,00:32:36.75,"now, and Eliza would be theonly hope."
526,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,>> Is there any way theycan convince her that if she
527,00:32:41.46,00:32:41.46,"comes with them, she'll have abetter chance or anything?"
528,00:32:43.75,00:32:43.75,"Is there any way?>> No, because then they risk"
529,00:32:45.79,00:32:45.79,a tie.Eliza's not gonna risk no tie
530,00:32:48.12,00:32:48.12,vote.That puts her in jeopardy.
531,00:32:50.71,00:32:50.71,"If there is a tie, it's myunderstanding that everyone"
532,00:32:53.08,00:32:53.08,would have the opportunity tovote again.
533,00:32:56.04,00:32:56.04,"And if voting again did notbreak the tie, the two people"
534,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,"being voted for, I think theywould get immunity, and the rest"
535,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,"of us would pull rocks, andwhoever drew a colored rock"
536,00:33:09.04,00:33:09.04,goes home.So Eliza could mess things
537,00:33:11.71,00:33:11.71,"up real bad.>> Yeah. Me, too."
538,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,">> It's really going to be toughto vote for Ami, really hard,"
539,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,"because I like Ami a lot and Ilike Julie a lot, too."
540,00:33:28.96,00:33:28.96,I have fun with them.I connect with them.
541,00:33:31.25,00:33:31.25,They have been my friends sincereally early on in this game.
542,00:33:36.46,00:33:36.46,"Oh, my God, he's been off withthem all day."
543,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,"Oh, my God, oh, my God,oh, my God."
544,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,I just like spendingtime with them.
545,00:33:42.96,00:33:42.96,They're just more funthan you are.
546,00:33:44.12,00:33:44.12,">> Does she not want you to?Who are you more sick of, Scout"
547,00:33:46.54,00:33:46.54,or Twila?>> Scout.
548,00:33:47.54,00:33:47.54,>> Really?>> Yeah.
549,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> How is that fair?If it was a 3-3 vote, we just"
550,00:33:59.25,00:33:59.25,"went at Tribal, didn't mentionit at all..."
551,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,">> Oh, my God, dude.>> All of a sudden, bam,"
552,00:34:03.92,00:34:03.92,"and it would be... oh, she wouldbe so mad."
553,00:34:08.42,00:34:08.42,">> Dude, that that wouldbe the best."
554,00:34:09.96,00:34:09.96,It would be the best thing thatcould happen in this game.
555,00:34:23.38,00:34:23.38,">> Feels good, doesn't it?>> Right now Scout,"
556,00:34:30.83,00:34:30.83,"Twila and Chris think I'm, youknow, 100% solid in this final"
557,00:34:34.04,00:34:34.04,"four alliance, but I do havereservations because I don't"
558,00:34:37.92,00:34:37.92,think Scout or Twila will takeme to the final three.
559,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,"Ami and Julie, on the otherhand, would take me, so I'm not"
560,00:34:43.62,00:34:43.62,afraid to change things if Ithink that it's going to get me
561,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,"farther in this game.>> Oh, there you are."
562,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,"Eliza could go either way, but Ihave a connection with Eliza so"
563,00:34:56.88,00:34:56.88,"I know that there is somethingin her heart saying, ""You"

616,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,I think that's one of thehardest aspects of this game.
617,00:38:03.62,00:38:03.62,I never imagined how close offriendships I would form here
618,00:38:08.25,00:38:08.25,and that it would really hurt tovote people off.
