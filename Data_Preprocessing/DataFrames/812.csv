2,00:00:02.47,00:00:02.47,"Survivor: Fearing Amber was out of the game, Rob felt lost."
3,00:00:06.33,00:00:06.33,>> I hope Amber is still here. Maybe Lex came through for me.
4,00:00:10.30,00:00:10.30,">> PROBST: But when the tribes arrived at the reward challenge,"
5,00:00:13.20,00:00:13.20,Rob got a pleasant surprise. Jerri voted out at the last
6,00:00:16.63,00:00:16.63,Tribal Council. The challenge came down to a
7,00:00:19.07,00:00:19.07,test of sheer strength. Rupert wins reward!
8,00:00:21.80,00:00:21.80,Rupert picked Jenna and Amber to join him on an overnight spa
9,00:00:25.67,00:00:25.67,"reward... >> Oh, my God!"
10,00:00:27.67,00:00:27.67,>> PROBST: ... where they were treated to some welcomed
11,00:00:30.67,00:00:30.67,creature comforts. >> I'm going to go back
12,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,there Superman. (chuckling)
13,00:00:36.37,00:00:36.37,">> PROBST: The next morning, the tribes arrived at what appeared"
14,00:00:38.93,00:00:38.93,to be a challenge. (all cheering)
15,00:00:41.27,00:00:41.27,It is the merge color! You will live your remaining
16,00:00:44.53,00:00:44.53,days right here on Saboga Beach. Their first order of business
17,00:00:49.00,00:00:49.00,was naming the tribe. >> How about Chaboga Mogo?
18,00:00:51.73,00:00:51.73,">> ALL: \xe2\x99\xaa Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga Mogo! \xe2\x99\xaa"
19,00:00:54.47,00:00:54.47,">> PROBST: When Rob and Amber finally had a moment to reunite,"
20,00:00:57.63,00:00:57.63,they had one thing on their minds.
21,00:00:59.90,00:00:59.90,>> We need to get rid of Lex. >> I'm here because of him.
22,00:01:05.40,00:01:05.40,>> Don't go soft on me. We're playing for a million
23,00:01:07.30,00:01:07.30,bucks over here. >> PROBST: At the immunity
24,00:01:09.17,00:01:09.17,"challenge, two individual immunities were up for grabs:"
25,00:01:12.13,00:01:12.13,">> Wow. >> PROBST: ...one for men, one"
26,00:01:14.33,00:01:14.33,"for women. For the women, it came down to"
27,00:01:17.37,00:01:17.37,Amber and Kathy. Kathy wins immunity!
28,00:01:19.33,00:01:19.33,"And for the men, despite Lex's early lead..."
29,00:01:22.33,00:01:22.33,"Boston Rob comes from behind, wins immunity!"
30,00:01:26.03,00:01:26.03,"Nice effort. Before Tribal Council, even"
31,00:01:29.13,00:01:29.13,"though Lex and Kathy had saved Amber, Rob told them the deal"
32,00:01:32.50,00:01:32.50,was off. >> The word I gave you
33,00:01:35.03,00:01:35.03,"was that if I can take care of you, I will."
34,00:01:37.53,00:01:37.53,"I'm sorry, I cannot. >> LEX: I had my game all worked"
35,00:01:40.53,00:01:40.53,"out. And if, and if I had gotten rid"
36,00:01:42.53,00:01:42.53,"of Amber, I would have come in here with my numbers advantage."
37,00:01:44.43,00:01:44.43,"In fact, I've... I completely..."
38,00:01:46.93,00:01:46.93,my own game. >> Right.
39,00:01:48.63,00:01:48.63,>> LEX: It's about getting a knife in the back.
40,00:01:50.63,00:01:50.63,">> PROBST: In order to save Lex, Kathy offered him her immunity."
41,00:01:53.80,00:01:53.80,>> I don't want it! >> PROBST: But at Tribal
42,00:01:56.57,00:01:56.57,"Council, Kathy had a change of heart."
43,00:01:59.87,00:01:59.87,>> Thought about it. I'm keeping it.
44,00:02:02.03,00:02:02.03,>> PROBST: A dumbfounded Lex was next to go.
45,00:02:04.40,00:02:04.40,"First member of our jury, Lex. The tribe has spoken."
46,00:02:10.50,00:02:10.50,Eight all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

50,00:03:38.43,00:03:38.43,">> Oh, my God. >> Our fire has a swimming pool!"
51,00:03:42.37,00:03:42.37,">> Oh, my God. It's nothing but a huge puddle."
52,00:03:45.37,00:03:45.37,>> It's gone. >> I knew when I saw the
53,00:03:48.40,00:03:48.40,puddle forming that the fire was going to be washed away.
54,00:03:52.57,00:03:52.57,">> Well, not only did Tribal suck, 'cause it always"
55,00:03:54.90,00:03:54.90,"sucks, but it poured on us the entire time."
56,00:03:57.23,00:03:57.23,We're freezing cold. And especially for me--
57,00:03:59.67,00:03:59.67,"I had to suffer two votes. So, I'm just happy to still be"
58,00:04:03.37,00:04:03.37,"here. >> Well, I'm glad..."
59,00:04:05.30,00:04:05.30,"I'm glad that's over. Now, where's Kathy?"
60,00:04:07.30,00:04:07.30,Is she okay? Is she...? >> Why?
61,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,"She take a walk? >> Uh, she's not over there."
62,00:04:11.67,00:04:11.67,>> What's done is done. >> She's bumming.
63,00:04:14.97,00:04:14.97,">> I was going to give my immunity away tonight at Tribal,"
64,00:04:18.30,00:04:18.30,"but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to, but I couldn't do"
65,00:04:21.37,00:04:21.37,it. (thunder crashing)
66,00:04:25.27,00:04:25.27,It's really hard being on the losing side of life here.
67,00:04:28.43,00:04:28.43,"I think Boston Rob has a soul, but, um, he has this temper, and"
68,00:04:33.67,00:04:33.67,"he was really hurtful today. And, uh, Amber's playing a tough"
69,00:04:37.07,00:04:37.07,game. She's lying.
70,00:04:39.27,00:04:39.27,"She's lying like a rug. So, I voted for the person that"
71,00:04:42.67,00:04:42.67,just lied to my face several times.
72,00:04:44.93,00:04:44.93,>> I think the votes would have come to me if I
73,00:04:48.07,00:04:48.07,"didn't have immunity. >> Oh, yeah."
74,00:04:49.80,00:04:49.80,>> Because you were... you're a target just like Lex
75,00:04:51.80,00:04:51.80,was. >> Everything went down
76,00:04:54.03,00:04:54.03,"according to plan. It was kind of a tough vote, to"
77,00:04:57.00,00:04:57.00,"tell you the truth. Lex was a friend, uh, but we are"
78,00:05:00.80,00:05:00.80,playing a game. He said some pretty personal
79,00:05:03.50,00:05:03.50,stuff to me before we went to Tribal Council.
80,00:05:06.40,00:05:06.40,"I understand when your back's against the wall, sometimes you"
81,00:05:10.20,00:05:10.20,"scramble, but I think he was pushing it a little bit too"
82,00:05:12.73,00:05:12.73,"hard. >> I said, ""Lex, you're"
83,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,"telling me that you want to go to the final four with me,"
84,00:05:18.13,00:05:18.13,"Boston Rob and Tom?"" He goes, ""Yeah."""
85,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50,His goal was to have us four friends up there making the
86,00:05:25.10,00:05:25.10,money. And he felt that for some
87,00:05:30.50,00:05:30.50,"reason, you guys had it just by kind of osmosis."
88,00:05:33.40,00:05:33.40,"And then all of a sudden, we get over here and we realize we're"
89,00:05:36.07,00:05:36.07,"on the chopping block. So, that's what caused the"
90,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,anger. And that's normal!
91,00:05:39.87,00:05:39.87,It should. >> Yeah.
92,00:05:41.50,00:05:41.50,>> We should be angry if we're on the chopping block.
93,00:05:43.03,00:05:43.03,>> I never promised Lex an alliance.
94,00:05:45.60,00:05:45.60,I never said two words to Kathy. A very important thing did
95,00:05:50.07,00:05:50.07,"happen today, though. Lex slipped up in his"
96,00:05:52.70,00:05:52.70,"conversation when he was mad, yelling and screaming, and"
97,00:05:55.13,00:05:55.13,"basically exposed Big Tom, meaning that Big Tom would have"
98,00:05:59.67,00:05:59.67,"switched sides. Big Tom, you got caught."
99,00:06:04.20,00:06:04.20,"And your best buddy sold you out, and he didn't even know he"
100,00:06:07.83,00:06:07.83,did it. (thunder crashing)
101,00:06:20.40,00:06:20.40,(thunder rolling) >> You couldn't have had a
102,00:06:42.63,00:06:42.63,horror movie any worse than what we had last night.
103,00:06:45.50,00:06:45.50,We got soaking wet. We've been waiting for daylight
104,00:06:48.47,00:06:48.47,for two days. Now it's daylight and it's
105,00:06:51.40,00:06:51.40,blacker than a dungeon. Looks like it's going to rain
106,00:06:55.33,00:06:55.33,again. >> Day four of no sleep.
107,00:06:58.27,00:06:58.27,>> We're going to start losing our minds a little bit.
108,00:07:01.70,00:07:01.70,">> Our fire pit is in a lake, in a little stream."
109,00:07:06.03,00:07:06.03,It's freezing cold and soaking wet.
110,00:07:08.67,00:07:08.67,"Make it through the night, (coughs)"
111,00:07:12.53,00:07:12.53,but... in hopes that when the
112,00:07:16.60,00:07:16.60,"sun came up, it'd be better. When the sun came up, it was"
113,00:07:20.27,00:07:20.27,still bad; it was worse. >> This beach is bad luck.
114,00:07:29.47,00:07:29.47,">> Yeah, it's like we're trapped."
115,00:07:31.57,00:07:31.57,>> I'd never seen a place that rained so much in my whole
116,00:07:34.10,00:07:34.10,"life, ever. >> I woke up this morning"
117,00:07:38.37,00:07:38.37,feeling vulnerable and scared and...
118,00:07:40.47,00:07:40.47,"I thought to myself, ""Why am I here?"""
119,00:07:45.30,00:07:45.30,I'm miserable. >> You're so stripped of
120,00:08:01.07,00:08:01.07,"everything out here, and you're not yourself."
121,00:08:03.07,00:08:03.07,"You're surrounded by relative strangers, even though I know"
122,00:08:05.13,00:08:05.13,"these people, and you're put in such a physically demanding"
123,00:08:08.30,00:08:08.30,environment that you have to bond together with them.
124,00:08:10.83,00:08:10.83,"But this is the final 11 days. We have food, warm beds, family"
125,00:08:15.57,00:08:15.57,to look forward to. That's what's keeping me going.
126,00:08:27.97,00:08:27.97,">> Okay, guys, we have tree mail."
127,00:08:30.00,00:08:30.00,>> Yay. What is it?
128,00:08:31.40,00:08:31.40,">> Oh, my God. >> It is, uh..."
129,00:08:33.53,00:08:33.53,"I know what that is, guys. >> It's a thing that you"
130,00:08:35.53,00:08:35.53,hang from that goes down the line.
131,00:08:37.53,00:08:37.53,>> Yeah? >> Yeah.
132,00:08:39.53,00:08:39.53,">> All right. ""Red team, Green team, Yellow"
133,00:08:41.57,00:08:41.57,"team, Blue. This mixing and matching must"
134,00:08:44.93,00:08:44.93,be confusing you. Working together to win on your
135,00:08:47.53,00:08:47.53,own. Bring the necklaces with
136,00:08:49.60,00:08:49.60,"you... it's not for reward alone."""
137,00:08:52.47,00:08:52.47,">> Oh, my God. >> Oh, my God."
138,00:08:54.50,00:08:54.50,">> Already, it's combined. >> That means we have"
139,00:08:57.03,00:08:57.03,"immunity and Tribal Council tonight, too."
140,00:08:59.93,00:08:59.93,>> It sounds like combined reward and immunity.
141,00:09:02.63,00:09:02.63,I thought the first immunity yesterday was going to last
142,00:09:05.57,00:09:05.57,three days. So I guess it's not.
143,00:09:07.73,00:09:07.73,"I got an ""X"" on my back. So, I have to win this immunity."
144,00:09:19.50,00:09:19.50,">> PROBST: What's going on, Rupert?"
145,00:09:21.50,00:09:21.50,">> Hi, Jeff. >> PROBST: Hi, Jenna."
146,00:09:24.17,00:09:24.17,"So, today's challenge is a doozy."
147,00:09:27.83,00:09:27.83,"It is part tribal, part individual."
148,00:09:30.60,00:09:30.60,It is part reward and it is part immunity.
149,00:09:34.20,00:09:34.20,And it is definitely physically demanding.
150,00:09:36.90,00:09:36.90,"It is a Survivor obstacle course, one of the toughest"
151,00:09:39.80,00:09:39.80,we've ever had. Two parts to the first reward.
152,00:09:44.43,00:09:44.43,Letters from home. >> Oh...
153,00:09:46.90,00:09:46.90,>> I saw my name. >> PROBST: There's one here for
154,00:09:48.67,00:09:48.67,"everybody, but only four of you will win them."
155,00:09:51.37,00:09:51.37,And four rain parkas. >> Aw...
156,00:09:54.00,00:09:54.00,">> PROBST: Four of you will have them, four of you will not."
157,00:09:56.57,00:09:56.57,"For the immunity winner, they also receive a little more"
158,00:10:00.00,00:10:00.00,comfort in the form of a video from home.
159,00:10:02.53,00:10:02.53,A chance to really connect with the people who love you back
160,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,"home, maybe give you what you need to get through these last"
161,00:10:08.87,00:10:08.87,11 days. Along with that comes a big old
162,00:10:11.67,00:10:11.67,"pitcher of hot chocolate. And, to whet your appetite a"
163,00:10:14.60,00:10:14.60,"little bit for this challenge, I put together a videotape with"
164,00:10:17.67,00:10:17.67,just a little sampling of everybody's loved one.
165,00:10:20.70,00:10:20.70,"We'll go inside, we'll watch it, take part in the challenge."
166,00:10:23.90,00:10:23.90,"One last thing, Boston Rob, Kathy, I need the immunity back."
167,00:10:30.53,00:10:30.53,One of these is no more. Individual immunity up for
168,00:10:33.60,00:10:33.60,grabs. Let's go watch some videos.
169,00:10:41.37,00:10:41.37,">> PROBST: Okay, I'm not going to lie."
170,00:10:43.37,00:10:43.37,"It's a very short tease. Amber, you're first up."
171,00:10:47.73,00:10:47.73,"This is your sister Nicole, your niece Emma and your parents."
172,00:10:51.67,00:10:51.67,"(sniffling) >> Hi, Amber."
173,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,"Say hi to Amber. Say ""We miss you."""
174,00:10:57.13,00:10:57.13,(laughs) Whoo!
175,00:10:59.13,00:10:59.13,Look at the camera. (blowing kisses)
176,00:11:01.93,00:11:01.93,>> We love you! >> Bye-bye!
177,00:11:04.80,00:11:04.80,>> PROBST: Do you have a tight family?
178,00:11:06.80,00:11:06.80,>> A very tight family. I think they're probably
179,00:11:09.33,00:11:09.33,"worrying about me, hoping that, you know, I'm just taking it day"
180,00:11:12.70,00:11:12.70,by day and getting through. >> PROBST: Okay.
181,00:11:14.60,00:11:14.60,"This is Alicia's mom. >> Hey, babe."
182,00:11:18.77,00:11:18.77,I miss you. I miss you terribly.
183,00:11:22.40,00:11:22.40,"Keep yourself focused. I love you, babe, and I'll see"
184,00:11:26.73,00:11:26.73,"you real soon. Bye, doll."
185,00:11:29.53,00:11:29.53,">> God, I didn't need to see that."
186,00:11:33.50,00:11:33.50,We talk every day. I know she misses me.
187,00:11:37.47,00:11:37.47,A lot. We're best friends.
188,00:11:39.97,00:11:39.97,">> PROBST: All right, Tom. Here is your son Buckie Bo and"
189,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,"your wife Sandy. >> Hi, buddy."
190,00:11:45.97,00:11:45.97,I hope everything is goin' good with you.

267,00:15:57.53,00:15:57.53,"seeing them, it's just the little things I notice, like,"
268,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,"as they're singing, Sabrina is using sign language 'cause she"

270,00:16:08.60,00:16:08.60,(sniffling) And their hair is short.

380,00:23:09.17,00:23:09.17,Okay. The four of you have already won
381,00:23:11.87,00:23:11.87,"a letter from home and a rain poncho, which can be taken back"
382,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13,"to camp with you. We're now moving on to part two,"
383,00:23:17.87,00:23:17.87,the immunity challenge. It's a traditional Thai puzzle.
384,00:23:20.90,00:23:20.90,Your goal is simple-- maneuver the puzzle pieces until the
385,00:23:23.70,00:23:23.70,"largest piece of the puzzle, containing the knife, will slide"
386,00:23:26.53,00:23:26.53,out of the slot at the bottom of the puzzle.
387,00:23:29.20,00:23:29.20,"Take the knife, chop the rope, raise your flag."
388,00:23:32.07,00:23:32.07,"The first tribe member to raise their flag wins immunity, is"
389,00:23:35.27,00:23:35.27,"safe from the vote tonight at Tribal Council and, in addition,"
390,00:23:38.60,00:23:38.60,gets a video from home-- their entire video-- and a pitcher of
391,00:23:41.97,00:23:41.97,hot chocolate to enjoy it with. A lot at stake.
392,00:23:45.37,00:23:45.37,Uncover your puzzles. Survivors ready?
393,00:23:51.43,00:23:51.43,"Go. Working the pieces around,"
394,00:23:55.93,00:23:55.93,trying to get that knife... out of the bottom.
395,00:24:24.50,00:24:24.50,"Boston Rob close. Boston Rob has it, has his knife"
396,00:24:33.00,00:24:33.00,"out. >> Move, come on!"
397,00:24:36.00,00:24:36.00,>> PROBST: Boston Rob wins immunity and a video of his
398,00:24:38.97,00:24:38.97,"brother, that I'm not sure anybody wants to see."
399,00:24:41.63,00:24:41.63,>> Yeah! >> Nice job!
400,00:24:56.87,00:24:56.87,>> PROBST: Rob nice enough to share his hot chocolate with
401,00:24:59.20,00:24:59.20,everybody. >> Thanks.
402,00:25:01.37,00:25:01.37,>> Everybody... >>> To Mogo Mogo.
403,00:25:03.37,00:25:03.37,">> To Mogo Mogo. >> And our true families, too."
404,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,>> Family and friends. >> Family and friends.
405,00:25:08.77,00:25:08.77,">>> Oh, is that good! >> It's really good."
406,00:25:11.80,00:25:11.80,"Oh, it tastes so good. >> Tastes like home."
407,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,">> Oh, it's really good. >> I've got a proposition"
408,00:25:19.67,00:25:19.67,for you. >> PROBST: All right.
409,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80,">> You know, my brother's gonna absolutely kill me..."
410,00:25:26.13,00:25:26.13,"but we have been living together for some time, and we had some"
411,00:25:30.63,00:25:30.63,"bad blood yesterday. Is there any way, if I forego"
412,00:25:34.53,00:25:34.53,"seeing the video, everybody could get their letter?"
413,00:25:37.50,00:25:37.50,>> Oh! >> Please.
414,00:25:41.70,00:25:41.70,"I think it's the right thing to do, 'cause everybody's hurting"
415,00:25:45.07,00:25:45.07,and everybody's missing home. >> PROBST: Great offer.
416,00:25:54.50,00:25:54.50,I can make that trade. >> Aw!
417,00:25:56.40,00:25:56.40,>> He's so sweet. >> You guys would have done
418,00:26:03.30,00:26:03.30,the exact same thing. >> PROBST: Okay.
419,00:26:07.03,00:26:07.03,Let's give out the reward. >> Yes!
420,00:26:10.03,00:26:10.03,">> PROBST: Alicia, here's your letter..."
421,00:26:12.03,00:26:12.03,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: ...and a rain poncho.
422,00:26:14.03,00:26:14.03,>> I forgot about the ponchos! >> That's huge!
423,00:26:17.53,00:26:17.53,>> PROBST: Amber. Shii Ann.
424,00:26:19.80,00:26:19.80,>> Your rain gear. >> Poncho!
425,00:26:22.73,00:26:22.73,My rain gear. >> PROBST: Boston Rob.
426,00:26:28.23,00:26:28.23,"And now, because of the generosity of Boston Rob,"
427,00:26:30.87,00:26:30.87,"Rupert, here's your letter from home."
428,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,Kathy. >> Thank you.
429,00:26:36.07,00:26:36.07,>> PROBST: There's something from home.
430,00:26:37.57,00:26:37.57,">> Thank you, Rob. >> PROBST: Jenna."
431,00:26:39.20,00:26:39.20,Big Tom. >> I hope it's a big 'un.
432,00:26:42.07,00:26:42.07,">> PROBST: You guys can get back to camp, find yourself a private"
433,00:26:45.07,00:26:45.07,little spot and really enjoy this letter.
434,00:26:47.43,00:26:47.43,"'Cause after that, game is back on."
435,00:26:49.90,00:26:49.90,Tribal Council tonight. Boston Rob's the only guy who's
436,00:26:52.23,00:26:52.23,"safe. Sadly, this game will be coming"
437,00:26:55.00,00:26:55.00,to an end tonight for somebody. (birds chirping)
438,00:27:08.53,00:27:08.53,>> I can't wait to read this letter.
439,00:27:10.73,00:27:10.73,">> Oh, my God, I'm so excited! >> So excited."
440,00:27:13.87,00:27:13.87,I didn't get my letter the last time.
441,00:27:15.87,00:27:15.87,Rob gave up seeing his family's videotape so that everyone could
442,00:27:18.50,00:27:18.50,"have a letter from home. That was really big of him, and"
443,00:27:23.33,00:27:23.33,it showed a strength of character that I hadn't realized
444,00:27:28.40,00:27:28.40,"about Rob Mariano. >> (voice breaking): ""I trust"
445,00:27:37.27,00:27:37.27,and know in my heart that you're doing well and you're the
446,00:27:40.20,00:27:40.20,"strongest man."" You know..."
447,00:27:45.07,00:27:45.07,(sniffles) It's just uplifting.
448,00:27:50.30,00:27:50.30,"I like it that my wife and daughter think I'm the toughest,"
449,00:27:53.93,00:27:53.93,baddest son of a bitch out there... even though I'm not.
450,00:27:59.30,00:27:59.30,"I like that, though. That gives me strength."
451,00:28:03.70,00:28:03.70,I'll read it a thousand times in the next 11 days.
452,00:28:12.30,00:28:12.30,>> I got a letter from my mom and dad.
453,00:28:17.03,00:28:17.03,My dad says that he's never known a stronger person...
454,00:28:22.60,00:28:22.60,that I've done so much in my life...
455,00:28:35.27,00:28:35.27,>> These letters remind me of my... my real friends and my
456,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,"family. And the friendships here, as"
457,00:28:42.50,00:28:42.50,"nice as they are, it's not this. It's not this."
458,00:28:47.37,00:28:47.37,It will never be this. (sniffling)
459,00:28:58.00,00:28:58.00,>> What Rob did today at the reward challenge was a generous
460,00:29:01.50,00:29:01.50,"move, but it was also a strategic move."
461,00:29:04.57,00:29:04.57,Giving up his brother's videotape for letters from home
462,00:29:08.13,00:29:08.13,may win him a million dollars. >> I don't remember the
463,00:29:18.30,00:29:18.30,"last time I was emotional about anything, ever."
464,00:29:22.10,00:29:22.10,"And you know, I do feel bad-- my brother spent all that time"
465,00:29:25.47,00:29:25.47,"making the tape and everything. But this way, everybody won."
466,00:29:32.20,00:29:32.20,"And I know it's going to get perceived one way or the other,"
467,00:29:36.57,00:29:36.57,it's inevitable. It wasn't about me.
468,00:29:40.00,00:29:40.00,"It wasn't about strategy. It was about strategy, to a"
469,00:29:44.10,00:29:44.10,"degree. It's a good move, yeah."
470,00:29:46.47,00:29:46.47,It is. I'm not going to sit here and
471,00:29:48.63,00:29:48.63,tell you it's not. But me... my family is the most
472,00:29:53.53,00:29:53.53,"important thing in the world, more than anything else, more"
473,00:29:57.97,00:29:57.97,"than money, more than anything. (sniffles)"
474,00:30:01.97,00:30:01.97,But I'm still getting the million.
475,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,I'm just having a... a little time-out for myself.
476,00:30:24.27,00:30:24.27,>> I am not upset. I was upset about violating a
477,00:30:28.10,00:30:28.10,friendship. Right then I threw emotion in my
478,00:30:30.40,00:30:30.40,"game. >> Emotion is in the game now,"
479,00:30:32.47,00:30:32.47,I mean... >> You know what I mean.
480,00:30:33.97,00:30:33.97,Like personal. >> I know.
481,00:30:35.57,00:30:35.57,"Honestly, I didn't know there was going to be a merge."
482,00:30:37.57,00:30:37.57,>> Yeah. >> There was no way of
483,00:30:39.57,00:30:39.57,telling for sure. >> It's over with.
484,00:30:41.50,00:30:41.50,We don't have to go over it. >> I just wanted you to
485,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,"know, regardless of everything, right, regardless of yesterday,"
486,00:30:46.43,00:30:46.43,like... >> We're fine.
487,00:30:48.73,00:30:48.73,>> Okay. >> We're fine.
488,00:30:50.40,00:30:50.40,>> I was trying to be nice to Kathy.
489,00:30:53.40,00:30:53.40,I know she's playing the game. I don't blame her.
490,00:30:57.70,00:30:57.70,"But to be completely honest, I have no idea how the vote is"
491,00:31:00.90,00:31:00.90,going to go tonight. >> I don't know who they're
492,00:31:04.50,00:31:04.50,"going to pick off next, but it might be you."
493,00:31:06.13,00:31:06.13,">> It might be me, but it might not be."
494,00:31:08.13,00:31:08.13,>> Yeah. >> Tonight the vote will come
495,00:31:11.27,00:31:11.27,"down to the last remaining... original Mogo Mogo members,"
496,00:31:14.73,00:31:14.73,Kathy and I. >> Today his thing with the
497,00:31:22.93,00:31:22.93,letters. >> Yeah.
498,00:31:24.93,00:31:24.93,">> Although it was very generous, it was a totally"
499,00:31:27.03,00:31:27.03,smart strategic move. >> That doesn't repair
500,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,"bad blood. To me, the letters-from-home"
501,00:31:32.23,00:31:32.23,trade for the video was just a bone.
502,00:31:34.70,00:31:34.70,"You know, probably down deep in his heart, he wanted us all to"
503,00:31:37.23,00:31:37.23,"have the letters, but higher on the list was the fact that it"
504,00:31:39.27,00:31:39.27,might counterbalance any of that anguish and anger that was
505,00:31:42.80,00:31:42.80,"exposed yesterday. If these guys were smart, man,"
506,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,"somebody would take him out. >> Well, they will, as"
507,00:31:48.50,00:31:48.50,"soon as he loses immunity. >> Yeah, they should,"
508,00:31:51.10,00:31:51.10,"but, you know, Jenna, I think she thinks she's going to be in"
509,00:31:53.60,00:31:53.60,the final three. >> She's not.
510,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,>> I can feel it. >> If they can all convince Tom
511,00:31:57.47,00:31:57.47,"that he's in the final three. >> No, Tom knows he's not."
512,00:32:00.47,00:32:00.47,"Tom's smarter than that. It's time now to get Jenna,"
513,00:32:03.70,00:32:03.70,Amber and Rob Mariano out of the power situation they're in.
514,00:32:08.07,00:32:08.07,Maybe I could help these players see the light that maybe I could
515,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,be used as a swing vote. And they do it now instead of
516,00:32:15.63,00:32:15.63,"waiting to go down to seven. Hey, listen, you need to start"
517,00:32:18.50,00:32:18.50,"reacting. You know, like at seven and"
518,00:32:22.10,00:32:22.10,"five, you have to do something here."
519,00:32:24.13,00:32:24.13,"You are flaking around, baby doll."
520,00:32:25.90,00:32:25.90,>> I think... I think about it. >> All right.
521,00:32:28.90,00:32:28.90,"Think about it at seven, because when you get down to five..."
522,00:32:30.90,00:32:30.90,>> Got to clean the house. >> Yeah.
523,00:32:32.40,00:32:32.40,">> Cut Jenna out. >> Yeah, you should."
524,00:32:34.10,00:32:34.10,I don't want her to win. >> You won't... she won't.
525,00:32:36.03,00:32:36.03,">> Okay. >> Remember, key times to mix it"
526,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,up is at seven and five. That's when I did it.
527,00:33:12.20,00:33:12.20,"Very difficult to do. If you want to save your ass,"
528,00:33:14.77,00:33:14.77,make sure you know what's going on.
529,00:33:16.77,00:33:16.77,>> I think we got some last-minute scrambling going on
530,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,in Panama today. Kathy and Shii Ann are working
531,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,it. They'll probably go after Amber
532,00:33:25.37,00:33:25.37,or Jenna. >> There might be something
533,00:33:28.40,00:33:28.40,that could be done. >> Right.
534,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,">> It would make sense. >> Oh, yeah, yeah, it would."
535,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,">> Yeah, but you think they're going to take you to the"
536,00:33:40.27,00:33:40.27,"final three? >> Well, that's why... I know."
537,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,You'd be a fool to sit here and...
538,00:33:44.30,00:33:44.30,>> Wait. >> ...and not do nothing.
539,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,>> Yeah. >> I've been sticking with
540,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,"my original deal, but when everything is going too good,"
541,00:33:51.57,00:33:51.57,you'd better be looking out. It flies apart.
542,00:33:54.17,00:33:54.17,And Shii Ann gives me another option.
543,00:33:57.07,00:33:57.07,I will be weighing my options all the way out.
544,00:33:59.37,00:33:59.37,">> Hey, Alicia, what were you saying... what were you"
545,00:34:02.77,00:34:02.77,saying this morning when you said Shii Ann was talking about
546,00:34:05.87,00:34:05.87,something? >> Kathy and Shii Ann are
547,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,implanting bad thoughts into Alicia and Big Tom's head.
548,00:34:24.03,00:34:24.03,"And they're buying it, I guess. And one person is all it would"
549,00:34:27.13,00:34:27.13,take to swing one or the other one way or the other.
550,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,"(laughing) >> I see it, it's happening"
551,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,right now. See them?
552,00:34:36.23,00:34:36.23,"Kathy, Shii Ann and Big Tom are all standing talking for a good"
553,00:34:39.03,00:34:39.03,15 minutes. I think they're switching.
554,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,My gut tells me that they wouldn't have talked that long
555,00:34:44.00,00:34:44.00,if he wasn't giving her an indication that he agreed.
556,00:34:46.90,00:34:46.90,"He's acting like he's not playing, but he's playing."
557,00:34:49.53,00:34:49.53,And the same with Alicia. Alicia wouldn't even meet my
558,00:34:52.13,00:34:52.13,"eye. If those four do bond, it will"
559,00:34:54.60,00:34:54.60,"be me they vote off. Alicia and Big Tom, I do worry"
560,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"about. Those two are the weak points,"
561,00:35:00.70,00:35:00.70,"because at this point, us four have been so wrapped up in the"
562,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60,"fact that we have a four alliance strong, nobody has"
563,00:35:06.07,00:35:06.07,bothered to try to like draw in Big Tom and Alicia and let them
564,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,"believe that they have an alliance with the final four,"
565,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,too. They might decide to save
566,00:35:14.57,00:35:14.57,themselves and go to the final four with the other two.
567,00:35:16.40,00:35:16.40,That's what burned me in the first game.
568,00:35:18.03,00:35:18.03,Perhaps I'm about to be burned at Tribal Council.
569,00:35:39.43,00:35:39.43,">> PROBST: We now bring in the first member of our jury, Lex,"
570,00:35:43.53,00:35:43.53,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
571,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"Hello, guys. Let's talk about the past few"
572,00:35:55.07,00:35:55.07,"days. Kathy, this has been an odd"
573,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"Survivor in that, at times, it's been as catty as ever a"
574,00:36:00.93,00:36:00.93,"Survivor has been, and then there are other times when I"
575,00:36:03.87,00:36:03.87,can't figure out how you guys are going to continue to vote
576,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,people out because I truly believe you've formed a little
577,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,nucleus here. >> That's what I'm having
578,00:36:11.57,00:36:11.57,"a hard time throughout the whole game is, you know, when do you"
579,00:36:14.17,00:36:14.17,start playing and when do you back off?
580,00:36:18.10,00:36:18.10,And when do friendships set in? It's been difficult.
581,00:36:21.30,00:36:21.30,">> PROBST: Big Tom, you've made some friends here that are going"
582,00:36:23.13,00:36:23.13,to make it really tough to vote them out?
583,00:36:25.57,00:36:25.57,">> It's always hard to put that name down of somebody else,"
584,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,but it's easier to put their names down than to see mine come
585,00:36:30.30,00:36:30.30,"up. I come to win and I want to win,"
586,00:36:33.77,00:36:33.77,"but I want to win with class, too."
587,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,">> PROBST: Rob, how do you win this game with class?"
588,00:36:40.87,00:36:40.87,>> I think All-Star Survivor is a little bit different than
589,00:36:43.33,00:36:43.33,other Survivors in the respect that there are real friendships
590,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,that were formed before we were even here.
591,00:36:50.47,00:36:50.47,"And then you come into the game situation, and is it about"
592,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,friendship or are you playing a game?
593,00:36:55.40,00:36:55.40,And it's been a big problem for me the last couple days.
594,00:36:58.87,00:36:58.87,"I gave my word on something, and I said that that was what I was"
595,00:37:04.03,00:37:04.03,"gonna do this time and keep it. So, there's no real answer to"
596,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67,"that question. Class, define class."
597,00:37:12.30,00:37:12.30,"You know? >> PROBST: So, at this point,"
598,00:37:15.13,00:37:15.13,"Shii Ann, why not vote you out tonight?"
599,00:37:17.77,00:37:17.77,What are you doing that should keep you in this game?
600,00:37:20.27,00:37:20.27,">> You know, being one of two remaining last original"
601,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,"Mogo Mogo members, I'm in the minority."
602,00:37:28.20,00:37:28.20,"And, of course, I am a target tonight."
603,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,"But I think that when people are voting from now on, they're"
604,00:37:34.43,00:37:34.43,going to have to start looking at who do I want to take with me
605,00:37:37.03,00:37:37.03,to the final two and who can I beat?
606,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,"If all this talk about alliance here tonight is true, which I"
607,00:37:43.63,00:37:43.63,"doubt, then I'm the next to go, and I've played as many cards as"
608,00:37:49.07,00:37:49.07,"I can, but, you know, it's not the end for me yet."
609,00:37:52.30,00:37:52.30,I may still win immunity. I'm a survivor.
610,00:37:55.13,00:37:55.13,"I'm here to win, and I will not go down without a fight."
611,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,">> PROBST: Kathy, why are you voting the way you're voting"
612,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,tonight? >> I'm voting for the
613,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"person that lied to me, and not that lying is something that"
614,00:38:05.67,00:38:05.67,"shouldn't happen in Survivor, but I didn't like the way it"
615,00:38:08.70,00:38:08.70,"went down. So, I just have to warn you"
616,00:38:11.03,00:38:11.03,"guys, that just so you know, it's, it's... it's gonna be"
617,00:38:14.47,00:38:14.47,tough scrambling when it gets down to seven.
618,00:38:17.13,00:38:17.13,"You guys, you don't even know what's going to hit you, because"
619,00:38:19.27,00:38:19.27,"people are going to be rethinking, and the fact of the"
620,00:38:21.33,00:38:21.33,"matter is, you're going to be short players for options."
621,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,"The heat is so intense when you get to seven, I think that, you"
622,00:38:27.67,00:38:27.67,"know, different combinations should have been occurring when"
623,00:38:30.77,00:38:30.77,"Lex was on. >> PROBST: All right, Rob, you"
624,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50,have the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Rob.
625,00:38:37.17,00:38:37.17,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
626,00:38:39.60,00:38:39.60,"Shii Ann, you're up. >> Amber, same old vote."
627,00:39:18.87,00:39:18.87,You need to play a new game or else you're not going to make
628,00:39:21.23,00:39:21.23,it. See you later.
629,00:39:38.00,00:39:38.00,>> Kathy. I don't discredit you for
630,00:39:41.40,00:39:41.40,"trying, but you didn't honestly think I was going to let you"
631,00:39:44.60,00:39:44.60,win. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
632,00:39:55.67,00:39:55.67,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
633,00:40:09.60,00:40:09.60,decision is final. The person voted out will be
634,00:40:11.60,00:40:11.60,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
635,00:40:13.60,00:40:13.60,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Amber."
636,00:40:21.93,00:40:21.93,"Kathy. One vote Kathy, one vote Amber."
637,00:40:28.20,00:40:28.20,"Amber. Two votes Amber, one vote Kathy."
638,00:40:33.33,00:40:33.33,"Kathy. Two votes Kathy, two votes"
639,00:40:36.50,00:40:36.50,Amber. Three votes Kathy.
640,00:40:44.47,00:40:44.47,It's four votes Kathy. 11th person voted out of
641,00:40:52.33,00:40:52.33,"Survivor All-Stars, second member of our jury: Kathy."
642,00:40:56.70,00:40:56.70,">> All right, you guys. Keep your eye on the million"
643,00:40:59.77,00:40:59.77,bucks. Good-bye.
644,00:41:02.37,00:41:02.37,">> I love you. >> PROBST: Kathy, the tribe has"

646,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,"Well, you're certainly a very different group from the last"
647,00:41:26.93,00:41:26.93,"time you were here, both physically and emotionally."
648,00:41:30.47,00:41:30.47,"Judging from tonight's Tribal Council, there's certainly a"
649,00:41:32.70,00:41:32.70,"whole lot of game left. Grab your torches, go back to"

669,00:42:33.40,00:42:33.40,further. I wanted that million bucks so
670,00:42:35.40,00:42:35.40,bad 'cause I got robbed last time.
