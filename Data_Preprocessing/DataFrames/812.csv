77,00:05:00.80,00:05:00.80,playing a game.He said some pretty personal
78,00:05:03.50,00:05:03.50,stuff to me before we went toTribal Council.

466,00:29:36.57,00:29:36.57,it's inevitable.It wasn't about me.
467,00:29:40.00,00:29:40.00,"It wasn't about strategy.It was about strategy, to a"
468,00:29:44.10,00:29:44.10,"degree.It's a good move, yeah."

490,00:31:00.90,00:31:00.90,going to go tonight.>> I don't know who they're
491,00:31:04.50,00:31:04.50,"going to pick off next, but itmight be you."
492,00:31:06.13,00:31:06.13,">> It might be me, but it mightnot be."
493,00:31:08.13,00:31:08.13,>> Yeah.>> Tonight the vote will come
494,00:31:11.27,00:31:11.27,"down to the last remaining...original Mogo Mogo members,"
495,00:31:14.73,00:31:14.73,Kathy and I.>> Today his thing with the
496,00:31:22.93,00:31:22.93,letters.>> Yeah.
497,00:31:24.93,00:31:24.93,">> Although it was verygenerous, it was a totally"
498,00:31:27.03,00:31:27.03,smart strategic move.>> That doesn't repair
499,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,"bad blood.To me, the letters-from-home"
500,00:31:32.23,00:31:32.23,trade for the video was just abone.
501,00:31:34.70,00:31:34.70,"You know, probably down deep inhis heart, he wanted us all to"
502,00:31:37.23,00:31:37.23,"have the letters, but higher onthe list was the fact that it"
503,00:31:39.27,00:31:39.27,might counterbalance any of thatanguish and anger that was
504,00:31:42.80,00:31:42.80,"exposed yesterday.If these guys were smart, man,"
505,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,"somebody would take him out.>> Well, they will, as"
506,00:31:48.50,00:31:48.50,"soon as he loses immunity.>> Yeah, they should,"
507,00:31:51.10,00:31:51.10,"but, you know, Jenna, I thinkshe thinks she's going to be in"
508,00:31:53.60,00:31:53.60,the final three.>> She's not.
509,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,>> I can feel it.>> If they can all convince Tom
510,00:31:57.47,00:31:57.47,"that he's in the final three.>> No, Tom knows he's not."
511,00:32:00.47,00:32:00.47,"Tom's smarter than that.It's time now to get Jenna,"
512,00:32:03.70,00:32:03.70,Amber and Rob Mariano out of thepower situation they're in.
513,00:32:08.07,00:32:08.07,Maybe I could help these playerssee the light that maybe I could
514,00:32:12.23,00:32:12.23,be used as a swing vote.And they do it now instead of
515,00:32:15.63,00:32:15.63,"waiting to go down to seven.Hey, listen, you need to start"
516,00:32:18.50,00:32:18.50,"reacting.You know, like at seven and"
517,00:32:22.10,00:32:22.10,"five, you have to do somethinghere."
518,00:32:24.13,00:32:24.13,"You are flaking around, babydoll."
519,00:32:25.90,00:32:25.90,>> I think... I think about it.>> All right.
520,00:32:28.90,00:32:28.90,"Think about it at seven, becausewhen you get down to five..."
521,00:32:30.90,00:32:30.90,>> Got to clean the house.>> Yeah.
522,00:32:32.40,00:32:32.40,">> Cut Jenna out.>> Yeah, you should."
523,00:32:34.10,00:32:34.10,I don't want her to win.>> You won't... she won't.
524,00:32:36.03,00:32:36.03,">> Okay.>> Remember, key times to mix it"
525,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,up is at seven and five.That's when I did it.
526,00:33:12.20,00:33:12.20,"Very difficult to do.If you want to save your ass,"
527,00:33:14.77,00:33:14.77,make sure you know what's goingon.
528,00:33:16.77,00:33:16.77,>> I think we got somelast-minute scrambling going on
529,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,in Panama today.Kathy and Shii Ann are working
530,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,it.They'll probably go after Amber
531,00:33:25.37,00:33:25.37,or Jenna.>> There might be something
532,00:33:28.40,00:33:28.40,that could be done.>> Right.
533,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,">> It would make sense.>> Oh, yeah, yeah, it would."
534,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,">> Yeah, but you think they'regoing to take you to the"
535,00:33:40.27,00:33:40.27,"final three?>> Well, that's why... I know."
536,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,You'd be a fool to sit hereand...
537,00:33:44.30,00:33:44.30,>> Wait.>> ...and not do nothing.
538,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,>> Yeah.>> I've been sticking with
539,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,"my original deal, but wheneverything is going too good,"
540,00:33:51.57,00:33:51.57,you'd better be looking out.It flies apart.
541,00:33:54.17,00:33:54.17,And Shii Ann gives me anotheroption.
542,00:33:57.07,00:33:57.07,I will be weighing my optionsall the way out.
543,00:33:59.37,00:33:59.37,">> Hey, Alicia, what were yousaying... what were you"
544,00:34:02.77,00:34:02.77,saying this morning when yousaid Shii Ann was talking about
545,00:34:05.87,00:34:05.87,something?>> Kathy and Shii Ann are
546,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,implanting bad thoughts intoAlicia and Big Tom's head.
547,00:34:24.03,00:34:24.03,"And they're buying it, I guess.And one person is all it would"
548,00:34:27.13,00:34:27.13,take to swing one or the otherone way or the other.
549,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,"(laughing)>> I see it, it's happening"
550,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,right now.See them?
551,00:34:36.23,00:34:36.23,"Kathy, Shii Ann and Big Tom areall standing talking for a good"
552,00:34:39.03,00:34:39.03,15 minutes.I think they're switching.
553,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,My gut tells me that theywouldn't have talked that long
554,00:34:44.00,00:34:44.00,if he wasn't giving her anindication that he agreed.
555,00:34:46.90,00:34:46.90,"He's acting like he's notplaying, but he's playing."
556,00:34:49.53,00:34:49.53,And the same with Alicia.Alicia wouldn't even meet my
557,00:34:52.13,00:34:52.13,"eye.If those four do bond, it will"
558,00:34:54.60,00:34:54.60,"be me they vote off.Alicia and Big Tom, I do worry"
559,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"about.Those two are the weak points,"
560,00:35:00.70,00:35:00.70,"because at this point, us fourhave been so wrapped up in the"
561,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60,"fact that we have a fouralliance strong, nobody has"
562,00:35:06.07,00:35:06.07,bothered to try to like draw inBig Tom and Alicia and let them
563,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,"believe that they have analliance with the final four,"
564,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,too.They might decide to save
565,00:35:14.57,00:35:14.57,themselves and go to the finalfour with the other two.
