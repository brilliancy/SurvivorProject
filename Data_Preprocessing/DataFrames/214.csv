3,00:00:05.70,00:00:05.70,>> JEFF: The tribes' spirits were lifted when a reward
4,00:00:07.33,00:00:07.33,challenge brought them a message from home.
5,00:00:08.73,00:00:08.73,>> KEITH: Will you marry me please?
6,00:00:10.93,00:00:10.93,">> Oh, my god. ( Tina laughs )"
7,00:00:13.00,00:00:13.00,>> Keith: Yes! Yes! Yes.
8,00:00:15.00,00:00:15.00,( cheering ) >> JEFF: The constant rain and
9,00:00:17.13,00:00:17.13,lack of food led to growing tensions between Colby and
10,00:00:18.43,00:00:18.43,Keith. >> COLBY: I'm not going to do
11,00:00:20.57,00:00:20.57,"this ration thing again when we run out of rice, Keith."
12,00:00:23.00,00:00:23.00,>> KEITH: Fine. >> COLBY: We are eating fine.
13,00:00:24.80,00:00:24.80,">> KEITH: There's something going on here, and I'm really in"
14,00:00:27.03,00:00:27.03,a very vulnerable situation. >> JEFF: Go!
15,00:00:28.93,00:00:28.93,Colby won his third immunity in a row.
16,00:00:31.40,00:00:31.40,">> COLBY: Sweet, baby! >> JEFF: And luckily for Keith,"
17,00:00:33.83,00:00:33.83,"despite his self-proclaimed vulnerability, it was Rodger who"
18,00:00:36.60,00:00:36.60,was voted out at Tribal Council. Four are left.
19,00:00:40.43,00:00:40.43,Who will be the next to go? ( birds singing )
20,00:02:00.97,00:02:00.97,>> ELISABETH: I'm the last of the Kucha tribe.
21,00:02:02.77,00:02:02.77,I was lonely last night. It's different here without
22,00:02:06.67,00:02:06.67,Rodger. He's a little treasure I
23,00:02:12.83,00:02:12.83,happened to find in the Outback from Kentucky.
24,00:02:24.17,00:02:24.17,Good rice. It was emotional for me to see
25,00:02:30.37,00:02:30.37,"Rodger be voted out, but he would never want me to, you"
26,00:02:34.10,00:02:34.10,"know, get all mushy and sad and kind of lay down and die."
27,00:02:37.20,00:02:37.20,"Like, no way. I'm gonna..."
28,00:02:39.57,00:02:39.57,I want to win this thing. I did not think I'd be...
29,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,this game would get me so emotionally sometimes.
30,00:02:46.30,00:02:46.30,"It all started when Rodger gave me his rock, started the"
31,00:02:49.80,00:02:49.80,"emotional roller coaster. That was early, too."
32,00:02:53.10,00:02:53.10,"That was, like, day four or something."
33,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,"Today I spent a lot of time talking with Tina and just, you"
34,00:02:58.07,00:02:58.07,"know, about family, about a lot. I think probably with Rodger"
35,00:03:01.93,00:03:01.93,"gone, I miss family more. >> TINA: I miss my husband and"
36,00:03:09.70,00:03:09.70,my children more than anything. >> ELISABETH: I miss my family
37,00:03:12.57,00:03:12.57,and Tim. >> TINA: Hmm.
38,00:03:15.07,00:03:15.07,">> ELISABETH: Just comforts, all the things you love."
39,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,I just miss them all. Sometimes I feel as if I'm
40,00:03:19.03,00:03:19.03,not... here for my life.
41,00:03:27.03,00:03:27.03,">> COLBY: I think my mom probably misses me the most,"
42,00:03:29.47,00:03:29.47,just because of-of how close we are.
43,00:03:31.70,00:03:31.70,"I mean, I know she's the one I miss the most, and I know she's"
44,00:03:34.17,00:03:34.17,the one that has gotten me through all this.
45,00:03:37.73,00:03:37.73,"I mean, I talk to her on a daily basis when I get off and spend"
46,00:03:40.23,00:03:40.23,"time by myself. Obviously, she doesn't respond"
47,00:03:43.37,00:03:43.37,"orally, but I know she's hearing me."
48,00:03:49.80,00:03:49.80,">> TINA: Whenever we very first started playing this game, we"
49,00:03:52.10,00:03:52.10,knew there were some luxuries that we could not afford
50,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,ourself. One was thinking about family.
51,00:03:58.63,00:03:58.63,"But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that,"
52,00:04:01.33,00:04:01.33,"you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can"
53,00:04:03.93,00:04:03.93,"laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity."
54,00:04:07.67,00:04:07.67,>> COLBY: I'm going to run to the grocery store.
55,00:04:09.17,00:04:09.17,"Do ya'll need anything? >> TINA: Oh, yeah, popcorn."
56,00:04:10.97,00:04:10.97,>> COLBY: Stop by the ATM machine and bring us some cash.
57,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,>> ELISABETH: Yeah. >> TINA: Okay.
58,00:04:14.33,00:04:14.33,>> ELISABETH: That'd be great. >> TINA: Put gas in the car for
59,00:04:16.10,00:04:16.10,me. >> COLBY: Will do.
60,00:04:17.57,00:04:17.57,">> ELISABETH: Yeah, there's a lot of, kind of make yourself"
61,00:04:19.80,00:04:19.80,"feel a little more normal. You know, Colby will run to the"
62,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,convenience store and pick up some gum.
63,00:04:24.00,00:04:24.00,We go to check the mail. Checking the mail is probably
64,00:04:26.67,00:04:26.67,one of the most normal things we do.
65,00:04:28.33,00:04:28.33,">> TINA: Oh! All right, you lazy bones, we"
66,00:04:31.30,00:04:31.30,"got mail! >> ELISABETH: ""You know that in"
67,00:04:35.73,00:04:35.73,"life, second chances are rare. And regrets for the past, you"
68,00:04:39.23,00:04:39.23,all have your share. Hope you've learned well all the
69,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,"skills of surviving, 'cause into the winners circle one person is"
70,00:04:45.80,00:04:45.80,"driving."" Maybe we're driving in the"
71,00:04:48.27,00:04:48.27,challenge. >> TINA: I think that's the
72,00:04:50.80,00:04:50.80,reward maybe. >> COLBY: I don't know.
73,00:04:52.80,00:04:52.80,"Sounds cool, though. >> ELISABETH: It does sound"
74,00:04:54.40,00:04:54.40,cool. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
75,00:05:08.53,00:05:08.53,">> JEFF: Come on in. Well, it's not often that you"
76,00:05:12.07,00:05:12.07,get a chance to make up for past mistakes.
77,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,Today you will. Today's challenge combines
78,00:05:18.03,00:05:18.03,elements of previous challenges you've already done.
79,00:05:21.63,00:05:21.63,"So if you've learned anything, piece of cake."
80,00:05:24.20,00:05:24.20,"If you haven't, you'll be repeating history."
81,00:05:26.63,00:05:26.63,You're going to start blindfolded and shackled.
82,00:05:29.93,00:05:29.93,"And you're going to take a carabiner, clip on to a rope's"
83,00:05:32.80,00:05:32.80,"course, navigate your way through a series of obstacles."
84,00:05:35.73,00:05:35.73,"When you reach the end of the ropes course, you'll ring a"
85,00:05:38.27,00:05:38.27,bell. That'll let you know you can
86,00:05:40.27,00:05:40.27,take off your blindfold. You'll then move on to the next
87,00:05:43.07,00:05:43.07,"phase which is a puzzle. When you complete the puzzle,"
88,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,you get a key. That undoes the shackle.
89,00:05:48.27,00:05:48.27,"You move on to the third phase. Filling a bucket with water,"
90,00:05:51.43,00:05:51.43,you'll move across a very narrow balancing beam to your fire and
91,00:05:54.13,00:05:54.13,water scale. Dump the water into the water
92,00:05:56.80,00:05:56.80,bucket. Continue this process until you
93,00:06:00.67,00:06:00.67,fill it to a point where it starts spitting water out.
94,00:06:04.07,00:06:04.07,"When it does, move over to your fire bucket, which is held down"
95,00:06:07.10,00:06:07.10,"by a taut rope, start your fire. When the fire burns through the"
96,00:06:10.20,00:06:10.20,"rope, the bucket will rise. First person to make a fire that"
97,00:06:14.10,00:06:14.10,lights the fuse wins the reward. >> COLBY: Hmm. Wow.
98,00:06:19.57,00:06:19.57,">> JEFF: Now, this is our final reward challenge."
99,00:06:22.23,00:06:22.23,"And it's a doozy. The reward includes a tent, a"
100,00:06:25.37,00:06:25.37,"mattress, four wheels, and a key."
101,00:06:29.83,00:06:29.83,You're playing for a Pontiac Aztec.
102,00:06:32.37,00:06:32.37,This is a car that converts into a tent.
103,00:06:34.83,00:06:34.83,The back end opens up. It becomes a tent.
104,00:06:37.37,00:06:37.37,You have a mattress inside. It's pretty cool.
105,00:06:40.17,00:06:40.17,"So, it will be waiting for you when you get back home."
106,00:06:42.47,00:06:42.47,But I want you to break it in first.
107,00:06:44.03,00:06:44.03,"So tomorrow night, you'll convert your new Aztec into a"
108,00:06:46.27,00:06:46.27,tent. You'll have a good night's sleep
109,00:06:48.70,00:06:48.70,here in the Outback. You'll also have the use of a
110,00:06:51.07,00:06:51.07,"hot shower, soap, shampoo... >> KEITH: Oh!"
111,00:06:54.47,00:06:54.47,>> JEFF: ...and a hot meal. Let's go do it.
112,00:06:57.07,00:06:57.07,">> COLBY: Unbelievable. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my God."
113,00:06:58.90,00:06:58.90,">> TINA: A car? >> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh."
114,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,>> TINA: We are playing for a car?
115,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,">> ELISABETH: And... >> JEFF: All right, guys, this"
116,00:07:03.90,00:07:03.90,is our last reward challenge. You're the final four survivors.
117,00:07:07.10,00:07:07.10,Survivors ready! Go!
118,00:07:10.30,00:07:10.30,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> JEFF: One carabiner on at all

120,00:07:44.57,00:07:44.57,>> JEFF: Take off your blindfold.
121,00:07:51.57,00:07:51.57,Everybody's still doing well. Keep it up!
122,00:07:53.50,00:07:53.50,"( bell tinkles ) Take off your blindfold, Tina."
123,00:07:57.03,00:07:57.03,"You're doing fine, Elisabeth. Down to the home stretch."
124,00:07:59.50,00:07:59.50,( bell clanging ) Do not lift anything.
125,00:08:13.63,00:08:13.63,"That's it. Remember, it's got to line up"
126,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67,with the pattern underneath. That's it.
127,00:08:38.87,00:08:38.87,Slow down and think. It's got to match the pattern
128,00:08:40.77,00:08:40.77,underneath. That's it.
129,00:08:55.33,00:08:55.33,That's it. >> TINA: Take my locks off?
130,00:08:57.43,00:08:57.43,">> JEFF: Yes. >> COLBY: That way, Elisabeth."
131,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,( Elisabeth panting ) >> JEFF: Everybody's still very
132,00:09:11.17,00:09:11.17,"much alive. All right, Colby."

135,00:09:29.17,00:09:29.17,Oh! >> JEFF: You're close.
136,00:09:37.33,00:09:37.33,You're tight. This might do it.
137,00:09:39.33,00:09:39.33,You're good. Fire.
138,00:09:59.63,00:09:59.63,">> JEFF: This will do it, Elisabeth."

140,00:10:22.83,00:10:22.83,>> JEFF: You've still got to build a fire.
141,00:10:34.33,00:10:34.33,>> TINA: Please be it. Jeff?

146,00:11:23.73,00:11:23.73,I never had a new car. I won a new damn car!
147,00:11:26.23,00:11:26.23,">> JEFF: Way to go, Colby. Tomorrow night, you're camping"
148,00:11:28.97,00:11:28.97,out in your new car. >> COLBY: Got one hell of a

150,00:11:34.43,00:11:34.43,I can. ( birds singing )
151,00:11:56.73,00:11:56.73,>> ELISABETH: This is the most challenging thing I've ever had
152,00:11:58.63,00:11:58.63,to do. On a daily basis.
153,00:12:01.37,00:12:01.37,"It's not the games, it's not the reward challenge."
154,00:12:03.23,00:12:03.23,"Those are hard in themselves. Like, they'd be hard anywhere."
155,00:12:06.03,00:12:06.03,Living here day-to-day-- those are the real challenges.
156,00:12:13.40,00:12:13.40,My hair is falling out! My hair is falling out!
157,00:12:19.33,00:12:19.33,My hair has been falling out in a lot of clumps.
158,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03,"I don't know if I can get one right now, but it just keeps..."
159,00:12:27.33,00:12:27.33,"Yeah, like, it falls out all the time."
160,00:12:30.00,00:12:30.00,"It's malnutrition. See, look at that?"
161,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20,>> COLBY: The old mail box. Look at that.
162,00:12:40.27,00:12:40.27,A scale. >> KEITH: What do you got there?
163,00:12:43.73,00:12:43.73,">> COLBY: A little vanity mirror for you, bubba."

165,00:12:46.87,00:12:46.87,again. >> COLBY: Don't need to look at

167,00:12:50.73,00:12:50.73,not to try it. The pounds melt away on the
168,00:12:53.27,00:12:53.27,tough Survivor diet. Living in the Outback is not
169,00:12:55.90,00:12:55.90,without cost. Just look in the mirror and see

171,00:13:00.80,00:13:00.80,a challenge. I think this is just a... just

188,00:13:34.77,00:13:34.77,What am I...? So I've lost 16.
189,00:13:36.60,00:13:36.60,>> KEITH: Wow. >> ELISABETH: I'm at 46?
190,00:13:39.50,00:13:39.50,>> COLBY: What did you weigh coming in?
191,00:13:42.40,00:13:42.40,>> ELISABETH: Probably about 113.
192,00:13:44.73,00:13:44.73,>> COLBY: It's 101. >> KEITH: What did I lose?
193,00:13:47.60,00:13:47.60,">> COLBY: Okay, Keith. >> KEITH: 65."
194,00:13:50.27,00:13:50.27,"Oh, my god. >> COLBY: What did you weigh"
195,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,coming in here? >> KEITH: 170.
196,00:13:54.33,00:13:54.33,">> COLBY: Oh, my God. >> ELISABETH: And what do you"
197,00:13:56.57,00:13:56.57,weigh right now? >> COLBY: 143.
198,00:13:57.90,00:13:57.90,">> KEITH: Whoa. >> TINA: Wait, what did you"
199,00:13:59.80,00:13:59.80,weigh before? >> COLBY: 190.
200,00:14:01.40,00:14:01.40,>> ELISABETH: And you weighed what?
201,00:14:02.87,00:14:02.87,">> COLBY: 25 pounds I've lost. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my God."
202,00:14:04.43,00:14:04.43,>> COLBY: You've lost 27? >> KEITH: 27 Pounds.
203,00:14:06.07,00:14:06.07,>> ELISABETH: I've lost... >> KEITH: The 42-day rice diet.
204,00:14:08.10,00:14:08.10,"Thank you, Australia Outback. >> COLBY: Oh..."
205,00:14:09.73,00:14:09.73,>> ELISABETH: ...12... 12 pounds.
206,00:14:11.37,00:14:11.37,Everyone was really shocked. There are 20 something pounds
207,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37,"lost by Colby, almost 30 pounds lost by Keith."
208,00:14:17.07,00:14:17.07,Tina is at 99. She's not even in triple digits.
209,00:14:20.57,00:14:20.57,And I'm not too far away from that.
210,00:14:23.10,00:14:23.10,I'm just feeling as though my stomach is eating itself.
211,00:14:27.13,00:14:27.13,"Combined. >> TINA: Combined, four people,"
212,00:14:29.67,00:14:29.67,we have lost 85 pounds. >> ELISABETH: We've lost a third
213,00:14:32.83,00:14:32.83,grader. >> TINA: That's scary.
214,00:14:34.97,00:14:34.97,"You know, I just... I can't believe it."
215,00:14:37.20,00:14:37.20,>> ELISABETH: Kind of blows your mind.
216,00:14:39.27,00:14:39.27,">> TINA: Yeah, you know why you're losing all your hair."
217,00:14:41.03,00:14:41.03,>> ELISABETH: Yeah. Now I know why my hair is
218,00:14:42.60,00:14:42.60,falling out. ( animals chittering )
219,00:14:58.40,00:14:58.40,( birds singing ) >> KEITH: See you guys in a
220,00:15:00.07,00:15:00.07,little bit. >> COLBY: All right.
221,00:15:01.37,00:15:01.37,>> TINA: Bye. Have fun.
222,00:15:02.73,00:15:02.73,>> COLBY: Keith goes on little sabbatical walks.
223,00:15:04.43,00:15:04.43,Keith and I haven't had a whole lot of conversation lately.
224,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,I think Keith is trying to figure out exactly what his
225,00:15:11.53,00:15:11.53,"strategy is going to be in the next couple of days, and"
226,00:15:13.77,00:15:13.77,probably also doing a lot of thinking about tomorrow's
227,00:15:15.73,00:15:15.73,challenge. I get the feeling that Keith
228,00:15:18.33,00:15:18.33,feels like he needs to win tomorrow.
229,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,"( birds singing ) >> KEITH: If my legs hold out,"
230,00:15:35.90,00:15:35.90,I'm going to go to the top of this ridge.
231,00:15:38.43,00:15:38.43,You can see 360 degrees over the whole plate land of the Outback
232,00:15:41.87,00:15:41.87,"here. It's a magnificent view, but"
233,00:15:45.03,00:15:45.03,it's a long walk. >> COLBY: I'm so pumped.
234,00:15:57.97,00:15:57.97,>> ELISABETH: You should be. This is unbelievable.
235,00:15:59.77,00:15:59.77,Unbelievable. You've waited.
236,00:16:01.97,00:16:01.97,You've been so patient. >> COLBY: I have been patient.
237,00:16:04.30,00:16:04.30,>> ELISABETH: And you are excited today.
238,00:16:06.00,00:16:06.00,"Yesterday, shocked, today, excited."
239,00:16:07.60,00:16:07.60,">> COLBY: Today, I'm pumped. >> ELISABETH: Yes."
240,00:16:09.77,00:16:09.77,">> COLBY: I'm just counting down the minutes, and hopefully going"
241,00:16:12.80,00:16:12.80,"to, uh, get a look at my new ride, my new wheels, and a hot"
242,00:16:15.37,00:16:15.37,"meal tonight. >> TINA: Colby, here's you some"
243,00:16:20.57,00:16:20.57,"flowers. >> COLBY: Oh, my gosh!"
244,00:16:23.83,00:16:23.83,Look at that. Thank y'all so much.
245,00:16:29.23,00:16:29.23,>> ELISABETH: Enjoy it. >> COLBY: The girls surprised me
246,00:16:32.17,00:16:32.17,"with a little car-warming gift, in lieu of a housewarming gift,"
247,00:16:35.37,00:16:35.37,like when you get a new house. A lot of people you deal with in
248,00:16:37.90,00:16:37.90,this game are-are disingenuous. They're just...
249,00:16:40.87,00:16:40.87,"It's not real. But with those two girls, I"
250,00:16:43.63,00:16:43.63,really believe it is. I'm so excited.
251,00:16:45.83,00:16:45.83,That is beautiful. ( women laughing )
252,00:16:54.03,00:16:54.03,">> TINA: Look to your right. >> ELISABETH: Oh, here's Jeff."
253,00:16:55.93,00:16:55.93,">> COLBY: What's up, Jeff? >> JEFF: Wow."
254,00:16:57.20,00:16:57.20,What's going on? >> COLBY: How you doing?
255,00:16:58.33,00:16:58.33,Good. >> JEFF: You ready to get out of
256,00:16:59.67,00:16:59.67,"Dodge? >> COLBY: Yes, sir."
257,00:17:00.97,00:17:00.97,"I'm so excited. >> JEFF: Your chariot awaits, as"
258,00:17:02.67,00:17:02.67,does a really nice hot shower and a hot meal.
259,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,"And we got enough grub, I'm going to join you if that's"
260,00:17:05.63,00:17:05.63,"cool. >> COLBY: Oh, perfect."
261,00:17:06.90,00:17:06.90,>> TINA: Wow. >> JEFF: Where's Keith?
262,00:17:08.40,00:17:08.40,>> COLBY: We don't know. He took off on a walk.
263,00:17:09.63,00:17:09.63,>> TINA: Oh. We love you!
264,00:17:10.97,00:17:10.97,>> COLBY: I wish I could take y'all with me.
265,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,">> ELISABETH: Well, we wish you could, too."
266,00:17:13.83,00:17:13.83,">> ELISABETH: Hey, Colby, enjoy your time."
267,00:17:15.30,00:17:15.30,>> COLBY: Thank you so much. >> ELISABETH: You have a good
268,00:17:16.77,00:17:16.77,night. >> COLBY: Let's roll.
269,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,">> JEFF: Well, wherever Keith is at, say-say hello."
270,00:17:19.60,00:17:19.60,>> TINA: Okay. >> JEFF: All right.
271,00:17:21.03,00:17:21.03,">> TINA: Have a great time. >> ELISABETH: Bye, Jeff."
272,00:17:22.67,00:17:22.67,>> JEFF: See you guys. >> COLBY: See y'all in the
273,00:17:24.10,00:17:24.10,"morning. >> ELISABETH: Bye, Colby."
274,00:17:25.73,00:17:25.73,">> TINA: See you in the morning, Colby."
275,00:17:26.93,00:17:26.93,"( Colby howls ) >> ELISABETH: Bye, Colby."
276,00:17:34.03,00:17:34.03,"Knowing that that was the last reward challenge, and I couldn't"
277,00:17:37.13,00:17:37.13,pull one out was kind of sad. When you come so close to
278,00:17:40.13,00:17:40.13,"something, you almost touch that car and have that warm meal, and"
279,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,then you don't get it. I want the prize at the end.
280,00:17:47.57,00:17:47.57,That's it. Simple.
281,00:17:51.20,00:17:51.20,And I was thinking a little bit about Rodger.
282,00:17:53.57,00:17:53.57,I miss him. And I really want Keith to come
283,00:18:00.37,00:18:00.37,back so we can eat. >> KEITH: We all find ourselves
284,00:18:12.30,00:18:12.30,"doing more of a going off and being by yourself time, uh, and"
285,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,thinking. I think what I spent so much
286,00:18:21.40,00:18:21.40,"time thinking about is my family, my children, my parents,"
287,00:18:25.23,00:18:25.23,"and of course, my fianc\xc3\xa9e. And I know that, I-I see the"
288,00:18:28.87,00:18:28.87,light at the end of the tunnel now.
289,00:18:30.93,00:18:30.93,It's-It's real close now. You don't have a lot of control
290,00:18:33.80,00:18:33.80,at this stage of the game. The cards have been dealt and
291,00:18:36.50,00:18:36.50,"fate is inevitable. So, it makes the most sense just"
292,00:18:40.57,00:18:40.57,"to kind of glide in, be cool and calm, enjoy these last few days"
293,00:18:45.03,00:18:45.03,the best you can. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
294,00:19:03.87,00:19:03.87,">> COLBY: Which, by the way, I'm still in disbelief."
295,00:19:06.03,00:19:06.03,>> JEFF: Yeah. >> COLBY: A car.
296,00:19:08.00,00:19:08.00,">> JEFF: I know, it is kind of..."
297,00:19:09.27,00:19:09.27,It's kind of... >> COLBY: You guys gave away a
298,00:19:10.80,00:19:10.80,car for a reward! >> JEFF: Yeah.
299,00:19:12.07,00:19:12.07,It is pretty cool. >> COLBY: Sweet! It's yellow!
300,00:19:14.87,00:19:14.87,Look at that thing! She looks good!
301,00:19:19.60,00:19:19.60,"How wild is this thing? God, look at the interior on"
302,00:19:22.73,00:19:22.73,"this... Now, this is a trip."
303,00:19:24.43,00:19:24.43,"It's awesome. I mean, the car is way cooler"
304,00:19:27.40,00:19:27.40,than I thought it was going to be.
305,00:19:29.73,00:19:29.73,And then here's the stereo and stuff under here.
306,00:19:31.97,00:19:31.97,And it's got some of the neatest amenities a vehicle has ever
307,00:19:34.63,00:19:34.63,"had. You know, you got a stereo in"
308,00:19:36.87,00:19:36.87,"the back of it, not to mention a huge tent."
309,00:19:38.87,00:19:38.87,This is unbelievable! >> JEFF: Yeah.
310,00:19:40.73,00:19:40.73,"Dude, you got to be hungry. >> COLBY: Too much."
311,00:19:42.63,00:19:42.63,I'm starving. >> JEFF: Let's eat.
312,00:19:44.23,00:19:44.23,">> COLBY: Let's grub, definitely."
313,00:19:45.73,00:19:45.73,What's going on here? >> JEFF: A little appetizer.
314,00:19:48.70,00:19:48.70,Have another cracker. You want to chew on this for a
315,00:19:51.93,00:19:51.93,"while, or you want me to bring out the good food?"
316,00:19:54.90,00:19:54.90,">> COLBY: Oh, yeah, bring it on. Let's see what we got."
317,00:19:56.30,00:19:56.30,">> JEFF: All right. Bring out the food, please."
318,00:19:59.97,00:19:59.97,"Oh, here comes our food. Thanks."
319,00:20:03.80,00:20:03.80,">> COLBY: Oh, my God! ( laughter )"
320,00:20:08.07,00:20:08.07,"What are you doing? Oh, my God."
321,00:20:10.90,00:20:10.90,What are you doing? Oh.
322,00:20:15.10,00:20:15.10,One thing you don't realize how much you miss until you...
323,00:20:18.03,00:20:18.03,you're here is the touch and the intimacy of loved ones.
324,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,"Oh, my, gosh! >> Oh, Colby."
325,00:20:26.67,00:20:26.67,>> COLBY: Being able to hold somebody and hug them-- that's
326,00:20:29.13,00:20:29.13,"one of the significant, uh, importances of having my mom"
327,00:20:31.53,00:20:31.53,"here, just because she brings some of my daily normalcy back"
328,00:20:33.73,00:20:33.73,to me. I got something for you.
329,00:20:36.20,00:20:36.20,"Two girls gave me, instead of a housewarming gift, a car-warming"
330,00:20:40.57,00:20:40.57,"gift, and they went out and found me some wild flowers, and"
331,00:20:44.50,00:20:44.50,so we'll set that. >> Oh.
332,00:20:45.93,00:20:45.93,How pretty. >> COLBY: Their names are Tina
333,00:20:48.27,00:20:48.27,"and Elisabeth, and they're two incredible women."
334,00:20:50.80,00:20:50.80,I can't believe you're here. ( Mom laughs )
335,00:20:53.03,00:20:53.03,"I don't even know... >> I can't, either."
336,00:20:55.43,00:20:55.43,>> COLBY: I don't know even how to act.
337,00:20:57.60,00:20:57.60,It doesn't feel like we're together.
338,00:20:59.57,00:20:59.57,>> This is just totally weird. >> COLBY: Mm.
339,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,"( laughing ) >> COLBY: First of all, you know"
340,00:21:04.00,00:21:04.00,what I've had to eat today? Four spoonfuls of rice.
341,00:21:07.20,00:21:07.20,That's our meal. >> And that's all?
342,00:21:08.97,00:21:08.97,">> COLBY: That's our meal, Mother, twice a day."
343,00:21:12.57,00:21:12.57,>> Seeing Colby after this length of time-- there's a look
344,00:21:16.27,00:21:16.27,"in his eyes that bothers me a lot, and I think it's... it's"
345,00:21:21.07,00:21:21.07,probably from hunger. And emotional isolation.
346,00:21:27.13,00:21:27.13,">> COLBY: After 38 days, I've been to the bathroom three"
347,00:21:28.40,00:21:28.40,times. >> Colby!
348,00:21:29.80,00:21:29.80,>> COLBY: Three times in 38 days.
349,00:21:32.20,00:21:32.20,>> It breaks my heart when I look at him.
350,00:21:34.70,00:21:34.70,"I knew he would... that he was going to lose weight, but..."
351,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,"as his mother, I wasn't really prepared to... to see how much"
352,00:21:45.87,00:21:45.87,"weight he's lost. >> COLBY: I mean, it's been so"
353,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,frustrating losing weight and being so weak all the time.
354,00:21:52.00,00:21:52.00,"I mean, you can't imagine how weak on a daily basis we are."
355,00:21:55.13,00:21:55.13,"We're just lethargic. It's just, the days are so long."
356,00:22:01.73,00:22:01.73,"Oh, now, we're talking! Oh."
357,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,There you are. >> You asleep yet?
358,00:22:09.77,00:22:09.77,>> COLBY: I feel horrible. Seems like we've been here for
359,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,six months. >> A lot of it's been tough
360,00:22:15.90,00:22:15.90,"emotionally, too. >> COLBY: It's so hard to"
361,00:22:21.93,00:22:21.93,imagine that the four of us that are left have made it through
362,00:22:24.67,00:22:24.67,"all of this. I mean, we say our prayers every"
363,00:22:27.37,00:22:27.37,"night at how fortunate we are to still be here, 'cause it's so"
364,00:22:30.50,00:22:30.50,easy to get kicked off. And you just got to keep your
365,00:22:34.00,00:22:34.00,"head in the game, 'cause it's so close now, and it's so important"
366,00:22:39.47,00:22:39.47,to play hard. That's all I've ever done from
367,00:22:43.33,00:22:43.33,day one is play as hard as I can.
368,00:23:07.87,00:23:07.87,Oh! This is by far the most
369,00:23:15.23,00:23:15.23,refreshing shower I've ever had. This morning was awesome.
370,00:23:21.23,00:23:21.23,Uh-oh. I think that's it for the old
371,00:23:23.37,00:23:23.37,shower. Out of everything that took
372,00:23:29.03,00:23:29.03,"place in the last 24 hours, the hot shower I was looking forward"
373,00:23:31.63,00:23:31.63,"to the least. However, now that it's done, I"
374,00:23:35.97,00:23:35.97,think I enjoyed it the most next to being able to visit with my
375,00:23:37.17,00:23:37.17,mom. I had no idea having a hot
376,00:23:41.43,00:23:41.43,shower would feel so good. >> TINA: That's a big dog.
377,00:23:58.20,00:23:58.20,>> ELISABETH: I love how we always wait for Colby's stories.
378,00:24:01.40,00:24:01.40,"""Colby, tell us how it is in the lap of luxury."""
379,00:24:07.70,00:24:07.70,"Oh, hang on, hang on. Keith, this thing broke off."
380,00:24:11.17,00:24:11.17,>> KEITH: Hold on. >> ELISABETH: We didn't lose a
381,00:24:14.67,00:24:14.67,lot right? >> COLBY: How's my family doing?
382,00:24:19.57,00:24:19.57,Oh! Look what I brought.
383,00:24:26.20,00:24:26.20,>> TINA: Welcome to Barramundi! >> COLBY: I've missed you all.
384,00:24:32.90,00:24:32.90,">> TINA: We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this"
385,00:24:36.77,00:24:36.77,"person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby's mom."
386,00:24:40.57,00:24:40.57,">> KEITH: I am the cook. >> Yes, I've heard."
387,00:24:42.93,00:24:42.93,Mister cook. >> TINA: She gave us all a big
388,00:24:46.33,00:24:46.33,"hug and said, ""This is a hug from home."""
389,00:24:50.40,00:24:50.40,>> And I know what state he was in.
390,00:24:54.30,00:24:54.30,And it just... it just breaks my heart.
391,00:24:58.23,00:24:58.23,>> ELISABETH: Colby's mom was... she was like the token loved one
392,00:25:01.47,00:25:01.47,from home. >> Lots of hugs.
393,00:25:05.13,00:25:05.13,>> ELISABETH: I think we were all able to feel that love and
394,00:25:08.47,00:25:08.47,feel that care that we've been missing for so long.
395,00:25:12.10,00:25:12.10,"I mean, when she hugged me... I felt my whole family there."
396,00:25:16.37,00:25:16.37,>> KEITH: It's an honor to have you here.
397,00:25:18.77,00:25:18.77,>> COLBY: Come look where we're living.
398,00:25:20.03,00:25:20.03,>> I am honored to be here. >> COLBY: And this is the lean-
399,00:25:22.20,00:25:22.20,to that we sleep in. >> Home sweet home.
400,00:25:24.20,00:25:24.20,">> COLBY: Yes, it is, home sweet home."
401,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,So is it what you thought we'd be living in?
402,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,">> No, it's a little cruder than what I thought actually."
403,00:25:30.97,00:25:30.97,>> COLBY: Four more days of this.
404,00:25:32.67,00:25:32.67,>> TINA: You want to sit down? We've got chairs for everybody.
405,00:25:35.00,00:25:35.00,">> COLBY: Yeah, here, Mom. >> Grandma is going to sit up"
406,00:25:38.33,00:25:38.33,"here, I might not get up again if I sit on the ground."
407,00:25:41.43,00:25:41.43,">> COLBY: Keith, the Yanks won the World Series."
408,00:25:43.53,00:25:43.53,">> KEITH: Oh, really? Wow."
409,00:25:45.53,00:25:45.53,>> TINA: You give us so much information.
410,00:25:47.67,00:25:47.67,"Can you tell us things like, the president and what's going on?"
411,00:25:52.67,00:25:52.67,"Tell me what's happened. >> Oh, my goodness."
412,00:25:55.60,00:25:55.60,">> ELISABETH: To hear stuff that's going on at home, it"
413,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,makes you feel as if the world doesn't really stop without you.
414,00:26:01.37,00:26:01.37,It keeps going. Our home's at home are...
415,00:26:03.80,00:26:03.80,News is happening. Life goes on.
416,00:26:15.07,00:26:15.07,">> COLBY: Right in the middle of conversation Mom gets up, kind"
417,00:26:17.93,00:26:17.93,of takes off for a sec and comes back like Santa Claus with a big
418,00:26:20.70,00:26:20.70,"burlap sack over her arm, and kind of throws it on the rug in"
419,00:26:23.47,00:26:23.47,"front of us and says, ""I can't leave without giving you guys"
420,00:26:25.47,00:26:25.47,"something to go on."" >> I think there might be some"
421,00:26:28.37,00:26:28.37,things in here you all would like.
422,00:26:30.13,00:26:30.13,">> TINA: Oh, my gosh! >> ELISABETH: Oh, what is it?"
423,00:26:34.17,00:26:34.17,>> COLBY: And she brought back care packages for Tina and
424,00:26:38.37,00:26:38.37,Elisabeth and Keith from their families.
425,00:26:40.80,00:26:40.80,">> ELISABETH: Oh, my mom! Thank you so much!"
426,00:26:45.40,00:26:45.40,">> KEITH: Oh, man. Oh, my God."
427,00:26:53.00,00:26:53.00,">> TINA: Gosh, she's beautiful! Oh, my gosh."
428,00:26:57.37,00:26:57.37,Look at this. Look at my daughter's legs.
429,00:27:01.90,00:27:01.90,">> KEITH: I had a moment. I mean, me looking at pictures"
430,00:27:05.10,00:27:05.10,"of my kids, and reading letters from my girlfriend, it hits..."
431,00:27:08.77,00:27:08.77,"you know, it's hard not to hold back."
432,00:27:11.30,00:27:11.30,"We only have a few days left, but it's hard."
433,00:27:14.63,00:27:14.63,>> TINA: You have done a marvelous job with this young
434,00:27:17.07,00:27:17.07,man. If my daughter marries a man
435,00:27:19.77,00:27:19.77,"like Colby, I'll feel very fortunate."
436,00:27:22.23,00:27:22.23,You did an incredible job. >> I really can't take all of
437,00:27:23.57,00:27:23.57,"the credit. I did help raise him, but you"
438,00:27:28.00,00:27:28.00,"know, he came from a gene pool. >> COLBY: It's almost like a"
439,00:27:32.97,00:27:32.97,"conjugal visit if you were a prisoner, you know, having"
440,00:27:35.53,00:27:35.53,"someone that can come see you, but you've got a piece of"
441,00:27:38.00,00:27:38.00,Plexiglas in between you and that person or something.
442,00:27:40.47,00:27:40.47,"It was, in a way, like that. It was bittersweet."
443,00:27:43.43,00:27:43.43,"I knew she was going to be here, but I also knew she was going"
444,00:27:46.27,00:27:46.27,"to get taken away. >> KEITH: I will be there, and I"
445,00:28:06.57,00:28:06.57,"will cook a dinner for you, I promise."
446,00:28:08.60,00:28:08.60,>> Okay. >> ELISABETH: We'll take good
447,00:28:11.40,00:28:11.40,"care of Colby, okay? >> COLBY: You get to ride in"
448,00:28:14.27,00:28:14.27,"style, don't ya? >> I guess."
449,00:28:24.23,00:28:24.23,>> COLBY: Tell everyone I can't wait to get back.
450,00:28:27.90,00:28:27.90,Warn 'em how skinny and hairy I am.
451,00:28:29.97,00:28:29.97,I told you I was skinny and hairy.
452,00:28:32.07,00:28:32.07,I love you. >> Be careful.
453,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67,">> ELISABETH: You all right? Oh, yeah."
454,00:29:24.50,00:29:24.50,"Yeah, it felt... it felt good. >> ELISABETH: What a lady."
455,00:29:27.60,00:29:27.60,">> TINA: What a woman. >> ELISABETH: She really is,"
456,00:29:29.70,00:29:29.70,Colby. >> COLBY: I'm so lucky to have
457,00:29:32.53,00:29:32.53,"happen what has happened over the last day and a half, but now"
458,00:29:37.07,00:29:37.07,it's time to shift gears. Now it's time to go play.
459,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,"We got to go do a challenge and then, inevitably, go to"
460,00:29:43.53,00:29:43.53,a Tribal Council night and get rid of one of those three people
461,00:29:46.97,00:29:46.97,"up there, if not myself. How weird is that?"
462,00:29:51.23,00:29:51.23,">> COLBY: Oh, look what I got! A Texas flag bandanna."
463,00:29:54.50,00:29:54.50,How cool is that? Still got my lone star pride
464,00:29:57.40,00:29:57.40,"going, man. >> KEITH: You can wear that"
465,00:29:59.00,00:29:59.00,"tonight. >> COLBY: Yes, sir."
466,00:30:00.50,00:30:00.50,That's way cool. >> KEITH: Not a whole lot you
467,00:30:02.60,00:30:02.60,can do right now. You go in and do the best you
468,00:30:04.53,00:30:04.53,can on these immunities. If you come out holding the
469,00:30:06.83,00:30:06.83,immunity then your position is set.
470,00:30:07.97,00:30:07.97,"If you don't come out holding your immunity, you better have"
471,00:30:10.27,00:30:10.27,your bags packed when you go to Tribal Council.
472,00:30:12.23,00:30:12.23,">> COLBY: Oh, you combed your beard."
473,00:30:13.40,00:30:13.40,I've got to do that today. My only loyalty is to Tina.
474,00:30:17.17,00:30:17.17,"There is no other loyalty for me, so it could be Keith or"
475,00:30:20.43,00:30:20.43,Elisabeth I'm going to vote for. I think both of them need
476,00:30:22.63,00:30:22.63,immunity to save themselves at this point.
477,00:30:29.20,00:30:29.20,>> JEFF: All right. You guys've been out here 39
478,00:30:30.87,00:30:30.87,days. Your once strong bodies are
479,00:30:34.90,00:30:34.90,withering away. The question is how sharp have
480,00:30:38.43,00:30:38.43,you been able to keep your minds?
481,00:30:40.63,00:30:40.63,That's what we're going to find out today.
482,00:30:43.20,00:30:43.20,"Today's immunity challenge requires one thing, memory."
483,00:30:47.93,00:30:47.93,There are 36 covers with an item underneath each one of them.
484,00:30:51.07,00:30:51.07,"18 matching pairs in all. Your goal, uncover as many of"
485,00:30:54.53,00:30:54.53,those pairs as you can. One at a time you'll go out and
486,00:30:57.47,00:30:57.47,"you'll get to uncover two items, any two items you want."
487,00:31:00.80,00:31:00.80,"If they match up, take it back to your bench."
488,00:31:03.10,00:31:03.10,"If they don't, you replace the cover-- next person goes."
489,00:31:06.47,00:31:06.47,The tribe member that gets the most matches gets immunity.
490,00:31:09.50,00:31:09.50,"All right, so I guess I need that."
491,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,This thing is molding itself to your neck.
492,00:31:14.53,00:31:14.53,>> COLBY: I hate to give it up today.
493,00:31:15.57,00:31:15.57,>> JEFF: You're already drawn straws to determine the order.
494,00:31:17.80,00:31:17.80,"Let's play. Keith, you're up first."
495,00:31:21.03,00:31:21.03,Get us started. Nest.
496,00:31:31.07,00:31:31.07,"Femur bone. All right, Tina."
497,00:31:37.37,00:31:37.37,A wooden kangaroo. Gourd.
498,00:31:43.87,00:31:43.87,Elisabeth. An emu egg.
499,00:31:54.27,00:31:54.27,Wooden kangaroo. Colby.
500,00:31:58.73,00:31:58.73,Wooden kangaroo. And a match.
501,00:32:02.80,00:32:02.80,"One match for Colby. Keith, you're up."
502,00:32:10.37,00:32:10.37,"Snake, a wooden snake. Wooden turtle."
503,00:32:17.17,00:32:17.17,Bullroarer. Jawbone.
504,00:32:27.00,00:32:27.00,"There's the urchin. Nicely done, Tina."
505,00:32:29.80,00:32:29.80,"Nice job, good match. Flute."
506,00:32:36.60,00:32:36.60,"Another match for Colby. Nice match, Keith."
507,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,Still anybody's game. Elisabeth.
508,00:32:47.20,00:32:47.20,Call this roo doo. Kangaroo doo.
509,00:32:51.93,00:32:51.93,">> COLBY: Why don't you pick that up off the plate there,"
510,00:32:53.03,00:32:53.03,Elisabeth? Looks like burnt marshmallows.
511,00:32:55.53,00:32:55.53,">> JEFF: Boy, you are hungry. Clay pot."
512,00:33:07.07,00:33:07.07,">> COLBY: Oh, nice! >> JEFF: Out of the blue."
513,00:33:10.13,00:33:10.13,"I'll take that. Nice match, Keith."
514,00:33:13.67,00:33:13.67,"Colby, he's catching up to you. Here's where we're at, guys."
515,00:33:19.57,00:33:19.57,"Colby gets one more right, he clinches victory, wins immunity,"
516,00:33:22.73,00:33:22.73,"can't be voted out tonight. Colby, you're up."
517,00:33:32.10,00:33:32.10,Jawbone. Does he remember?
518,00:33:39.63,00:33:39.63,">> COLBY: No, he does not. >> JEFF: You were the one who"
519,00:33:42.00,00:33:42.00,uncovered it. >> COLBY: I know and I can't
520,00:33:44.27,00:33:44.27,remember where I just uncovered that thing.
521,00:33:56.60,00:33:56.60,>> JEFF: Jawbone. That's it.
522,00:34:00.23,00:34:00.23,Immunity again for Colby. Well done.
523,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,This has had a permanent home here for a while.
524,00:34:07.50,00:34:07.50,>> COLBY: Been pretty fortunate. >> JEFF: You guys have a few
525,00:34:09.53,00:34:09.53,hours before Tribal Council. I don't know how you're going to
526,00:34:12.63,00:34:12.63,"vote, I don't know how you're going to figure this out, but"
527,00:34:15.03,00:34:15.03,you can head back to camp and think about it.
528,00:34:42.10,00:34:42.10,>> ELISABETH: Look at them. Two of them.
529,00:34:46.57,00:34:46.57,>> KEITH: Where? >> ELISABETH: Right back there.
530,00:34:49.30,00:34:49.30,">> KEITH: Oh, yeah. Colby's mom is gone and we've"
531,00:34:58.00,00:34:58.00,"had our little interlude, our intermezzo, if you will."
532,00:35:03.07,00:35:03.07,The game is back on. It's anybody's game right now as
533,00:35:06.63,00:35:06.63,far as who's going to be in the last three.
534,00:35:08.23,00:35:08.23,Anybody's game. >> COLBY: No matter what happens
535,00:35:12.00,00:35:12.00,"tonight, that changes 'cause one of us is gone."
536,00:35:14.07,00:35:14.07,>> ELISABETH: I know. >> COLBY: That's a harsh
537,00:35:15.40,00:35:15.40,reality. >> TINA: There is a sense of
538,00:35:18.37,00:35:18.37,doom and gloom about Tribal Council.
539,00:35:20.90,00:35:20.90,>> ELISABETH: I don't want to go.
540,00:35:23.23,00:35:23.23,>> TINA: And it seems that the day of Tribal Council people are
541,00:35:27.13,00:35:27.13,"whispering and talking and a little bit of paranoia sets in,"
542,00:35:29.53,00:35:29.53,too. You don't have as many people to
543,00:35:34.47,00:35:34.47,"choose from to kick off, you know, there's only four of you"
544,00:35:37.43,00:35:37.43,and one of you's got to go. >> COLBY: I still haven't made
545,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,up my mind as far as who I'm going to vote for.
546,00:35:57.10,00:35:57.10,"It comes down to two things, strategy or philanthropy."
547,00:36:01.87,00:36:01.87,"On one hand, you got, who deserves it, who's a righteous"
548,00:36:04.53,00:36:04.53,"person, who needs that money? Or the other side, is strategy."
549,00:36:08.63,00:36:08.63,"How can I get that, how can I put that money in my pocket?"
550,00:36:11.97,00:36:11.97,"That's something we've all weighed from day one, how bad do"
551,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,you want the money? >> JEFF: We now bring in the
552,00:37:01.57,00:37:01.57,jury. The jury has now grown to five.
553,00:37:12.97,00:37:12.97,"All five of them sitting there, due in no small part to votes"
554,00:37:16.60,00:37:16.60,"cast from the four of you. Tonight, one of you will be"
555,00:37:20.30,00:37:20.30,leaving this side of Tribal Council and moving to the jury
556,00:37:22.40,00:37:22.40,side. Let's talk about what's gone on
557,00:37:26.30,00:37:26.30,"the last three days. Because in that time span, Colby"
558,00:37:31.23,00:37:31.23,has had a whole lot of activity going on.
559,00:37:34.03,00:37:34.03,"Tina, as he wears the immunity necklace again, how frustrating"
560,00:37:37.70,00:37:37.70,is it to not be able to beat him?
561,00:37:40.70,00:37:40.70,>> TINA: It's frustrating that he's got all the food
562,00:37:43.13,00:37:43.13,"challenges, and he goes away and eats and eats and eats, and some"
563,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,of us have got no food. But it's not one of those things
564,00:37:51.90,00:37:51.90,"that you resent him at all, because on some level you have"
565,00:37:55.60,00:37:55.60,"to admire someone who is that tough of a quality person, who"
566,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,has all those attributes that allows him to win all these
567,00:38:03.33,00:38:03.33,"challenges. >> JEFF: Keith, do you still"
568,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,"feel competitive? >> Oh, sure, there's no"
569,00:38:07.37,00:38:07.37,question. Going into the physical
570,00:38:10.60,00:38:10.60,"challenges are more difficult now because I've lost 27 pounds,"
571,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,this is kind of an astonishing thing for me.
572,00:38:16.47,00:38:16.47,And it takes a lot for me to get up to go to fill the truck up
573,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,with gas and do anything strong physically.
574,00:38:23.67,00:38:23.67,"Coming in I was very strong, and I was fast, but I've seen it"
575,00:38:27.03,00:38:27.03,"tremendously. >> JEFF: Colby, provided you"
576,00:38:30.30,00:38:30.30,"make it to the final two, what kind of impact do you think"
577,00:38:32.97,00:38:32.97,"tonight's vote, how you vote specifically, will have on the"
578,00:38:34.77,00:38:34.77,jury? >> COLBY: That's by far the
579,00:38:37.80,00:38:37.80,toughest part of this part of the game.
580,00:38:39.80,00:38:39.80,"You sit here and you throw around the word ""strategy."""
581,00:38:42.53,00:38:42.53,"Well, if you're playing strategically, you've got to"
582,00:38:45.23,00:38:45.23,"look at them and think if you're going to be strategic, you've"
583,00:38:48.13,00:38:48.13,got to think about what they're thinking.
584,00:38:49.90,00:38:49.90,"We have no idea. And you can, you know, maybe up"
585,00:38:54.70,00:38:54.70,your stock or cut your throat in the same night and you won't
586,00:38:57.40,00:38:57.40,"know until it's too late. >> JEFF: Elisabeth, why are you"
587,00:39:00.70,00:39:00.70,voting the way you're voting tonight?
588,00:39:02.57,00:39:02.57,What's it based on? >> ELISABETH: I vote on my gut.
589,00:39:05.90,00:39:05.90,"I have always since I was little, I mean, my parents have"
590,00:39:10.40,00:39:10.40,"taught me let your conscience be your guide, and I have a very"
591,00:39:13.70,00:39:13.70,"strong conscience, I have a very strong gut instinct, and that's"
592,00:39:16.97,00:39:16.97,"how I voted from day one. Um, and I just, I think about"
593,00:39:23.50,00:39:23.50,"the right thing, and I do it. >> JEFF: Let's vote."
594,00:39:27.13,00:39:27.13,"Keith, you're up. >> KEITH: I said it before, I'll"
595,00:39:43.80,00:39:43.80,"say it again, I think you're an absolutely wonderful person, and"
596,00:39:47.03,00:39:47.03,some day I would love my daughter to spend a day with you
597,00:39:49.67,00:39:49.67,because I think she can learn a great deal from you.
598,00:39:51.93,00:39:51.93,"Good luck to you, Elisabeth. >> ELISABETH: Even though you've"
599,00:40:21.77,00:40:21.77,"calmed down your cockiness a bit, because I think we've all"
600,00:40:24.20,00:40:24.20,"felt a little more vulnerable lately, you're still my vote."
601,00:40:27.40,00:40:27.40,Nothing personal today. >> JEFF: Once the votes are
602,00:40:49.87,00:40:49.87,"tallied, the decision is final. The person voted out of the"
603,00:40:52.67,00:40:52.67,tribe will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
604,00:40:55.73,00:40:55.73,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Elisabeth."
605,00:41:08.20,00:41:08.20,Keith. Elisabeth.
606,00:41:15.80,00:41:15.80,Last vote... Elisabeth.
607,00:41:24.00,00:41:24.00,"You need to bring me your torch. >> ELISABETH: Go get them, guys."
608,00:41:36.80,00:41:36.80,"Play hard, and try and wear that thing."
609,00:41:44.47,00:41:44.47,">> JEFF: Elisabeth, the tribe has spoken."
610,00:41:50.73,00:41:50.73,It's time for you to go. Good-bye.
611,00:41:58.10,00:41:58.10,"Well, it's come down to this. Three days, two Tribal Councils,"
612,00:42:03.00,00:42:03.00,one winner. Head back to camp.
613,00:42:35.73,00:42:35.73,>> ELISABETH: My part of the game is over.
614,00:42:38.60,00:42:38.60,It's been the most trying experience of my life.
615,00:42:42.17,00:42:42.17,Filled with the most highs and lows in a short period of time
616,00:42:45.00,00:42:45.00,that I could have ever imagined. I know that they just didn't
617,00:42:49.13,00:42:49.13,want me to get into the final two because I would have kicked
618,00:42:51.53,00:42:51.53,some major butt in that situation.
