145,00:10:54.33,00:10:54.33,Yau-Man is not nice.He sucks.

191,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,>> Who said I have them?>> She made... she made a
192,00:13:16.88,00:13:16.88,comment about Tracy's boobs.And I'm like...
193,00:13:22.04,00:13:22.04,">> Oh, my god!>> The second the crazy lady"
194,00:13:25.46,00:13:25.46,"found the immunity idol, I thinkeveryone was a little worried,"
195,00:13:29.21,00:13:29.21,because I think we all kind offelt as a consensus that she was
196,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,going to be its first one to go.>> I'm sure I got off on the
197,00:13:36.83,00:13:36.83,wrong foot.I guess sometimes it pays to
198,00:13:39.75,00:13:39.75,"keep your mouth shut, but Ican't help myself."
199,00:13:51.75,00:13:51.75,>> So here.Let's build a shelter before it
200,00:13:54.12,00:13:54.12,"rains again.>> The fact that we, the"
201,00:14:02.25,00:14:02.25,"favorites, have played this gamebefore, I think that is our"
202,00:14:04.38,00:14:04.38,biggest advantage.And it's an expectation that
203,00:14:07.54,00:14:07.54,we've got to live up to.>> Can we just make a pact right
204,00:14:09.96,00:14:09.96,now that we're just going tokick their asses?
205,00:14:12.17,00:14:12.17,>> Of course.>> We should do our shelter as
206,00:14:14.21,00:14:14.21,fast as possible.>> It's just out in the open?
207,00:14:16.38,00:14:16.38,">> Yeah.>> I mean, like, do we have"
208,00:14:19.04,00:14:19.04,people who know how to build ashelter?
209,00:14:21.21,00:14:21.21,"Let's build a real shelter.Pretty crazy, fans versus"
210,00:14:24.38,00:14:24.38,favorites.We always knew Jonny Fairplay
211,00:14:26.96,00:14:26.96,"was a favorite.Honestly, I think that's the"
212,00:14:29.17,00:14:29.17,"smartest place, but, you know,I'm not fighting anybody on"
213,00:14:31.46,00:14:31.46,anything.The first time around I was just
214,00:14:33.83,00:14:33.83,a single guy on the prowl.This go-around I've got a
215,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33,girlfriend at home.She's seven months pregnant.
216,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33,Need to bring home some moneyfor her.
217,00:14:42.62,00:14:42.62,So let's get to work.I just got a message in a bottle
218,00:14:48.58,00:14:48.58,"saying my grandma died, so...>> Not falling for that one"
219,00:14:52.83,00:14:52.83,again.>> Are you kidding me?
220,00:14:56.58,00:14:56.58,"Look at how fast he is.>> I know, it's insane."
221,00:14:59.21,00:14:59.21,>> I definitely appreciate thehard work that goes on around
222,00:15:02.21,00:15:02.21,this camp.It's so much nicer to have
223,00:15:04.88,00:15:04.88,"everybody pulling the rope andgetting everything together,"
224,00:15:07.96,00:15:07.96,helping each other and stuff.I almost wanted to give somebody
225,00:15:09.88,00:15:09.88,"a hug, because it was reallynice."
226,00:15:12.21,00:15:12.21,">> Nice, Ozzy!This is so much more pleasant"
227,00:15:15.17,00:15:15.17,"than day one of last time.>> I know, right?"
228,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,">> I mean, we all know whatwe're doing already, so, I mean,"
229,00:15:20.54,00:15:20.54,the favorites should definitelyhave the advantage over the
230,00:15:23.17,00:15:23.17,fans.>> We're pretty much ready for
231,00:15:24.67,00:15:24.67,"palm fronds, right?>> Yeah."
232,00:15:31.33,00:15:31.33,>> I think we have a good group.I hope we win.
233,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,">> I think so, too.Everyone's already, like,"
234,00:15:36.25,00:15:36.25,bonding together.I have to win this time.
235,00:15:38.42,00:15:38.42,It's my second time.I'm not coming back here to
236,00:15:41.00,00:15:41.00,starve and be miserable.Do you want to get more fronds?
237,00:15:44.25,00:15:44.25,I was the flirt on Cook Islandsand that was it.
238,00:15:47.12,00:15:47.12,"Like, there was no otherdimension to me at all, I don't"
239,00:15:49.17,00:15:49.17,think.Do you want a piggyback?
240,00:15:51.96,00:15:51.96,>> Yeah.>> ( laughing )
241,00:15:55.88,00:15:55.88,"Like, outwardly, I'm still goingto be flirty, but I'm playing"
242,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,"smart this time.Like, I want to make the right"
243,00:16:01.21,00:16:01.21,alliances with people that Iknow I can trust.
244,00:16:03.42,00:16:03.42,"Oh, look at that crab.( screaming )"
245,00:16:07.21,00:16:07.21,"And this time there's only oneguy to flirt with, really."
246,00:16:10.42,00:16:10.42,"It's the big guy, James.>> No, don't."
247,00:16:14.12,00:16:14.12,">> He has, like, a pincher onthe bottom."
248,00:16:17.08,00:16:17.08,>> Parvati is definitelyattractive.
249,00:16:18.96,00:16:18.96,"And she's... you know, there'sjust something about her that..."
250,00:16:20.88,00:16:20.88,"she's one of them sex kitten-type girls, and I like it."
251,00:16:30.33,00:16:30.33,>> I will be... I'll be totallyhonest with you.
252,00:16:33.12,00:16:33.12,"If you saw my season, you canknow that when I say I'm going"
253,00:16:36.33,00:16:36.33,to stick to something and doit...
254,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,>> Yeah.I... you know what?
255,00:16:40.25,00:16:40.25,"It's so funny that you're here,because you're, like, one of my"
256,00:16:42.54,00:16:42.54,"favorite players.I don't know, I think that's"
257,00:16:44.42,00:16:44.42,really cool.I'd say I have pretty keen
258,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,"powers of observation, and fromwhat I can tell, Amanda and Ozzy"
259,00:16:50.21,00:16:50.21,have this rapport with oneanother already.
260,00:16:54.21,00:16:54.21,">> And you're, like, the loyalone, you know?"
261,00:16:56.33,00:16:56.33,"Like, I think that's so awesome.>> And ever since we got here,"
262,00:16:59.38,00:16:59.38,Parvati hasn't been able to takeher hands or eyes off of James.
263,00:17:06.12,00:17:06.12,She is definitely going to havehim wrapped around her finger.
264,00:17:09.12,00:17:09.12,So I think there definitelycould be romance bubbling
265,00:17:11.62,00:17:11.62,between both Parvati and Jamesand Amanda and Ozzy.
266,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,And so that makes all four ofthem very dangerous.
267,00:17:18.79,00:17:18.79,">> Good night, John Boy.>> Good night, favorites."
268,00:17:20.83,00:17:20.83,">> Good night, favorites.>> Palm fronds."
269,00:17:27.54,00:17:27.54,"Do we need anything more?>> Yeah, let's put the fronds on"
270,00:17:30.08,00:17:30.08,"the ground, too.>> That's a good idea."
271,00:17:32.79,00:17:32.79,>> Is anybody over here?>> Here comes another one.
272,00:17:34.88,00:17:34.88,">> Tonight is night number one,and we kind of took a little too"
273,00:17:38.25,00:17:38.25,"long to find a location to buildour shelter, and it didn't come"
274,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,along as planned.>> Holy crap.
275,00:18:01.54,00:18:01.54,">> Tonight's the first nighthere, and the downpour, it came"
276,00:18:06.33,00:18:06.33,"and it was hard, and it didn'tstop."
277,00:18:08.33,00:18:08.33,( thunder )I hope by morning I feel a whole
278,00:18:19.21,00:18:19.21,"lot better, because right nowthis sucks."
279,00:18:23.25,00:18:23.25,( crying )>> I know you are.
280,00:18:43.38,00:18:43.38,>> I think that...>> This would be awesome.
281,00:18:45.88,00:18:45.88,>> We would be a really goodgroup.
282,00:18:48.04,00:18:48.04,">> Yeah, why don't we sticktogether starting now?"
283,00:18:49.58,00:18:49.58,>> Starting now?>> We're not supposed to scheme
284,00:18:52.04,00:18:52.04,"until tomorrow.>> Come on, everyone else is"
285,00:18:54.04,00:18:54.04,scheming.>> I love it.
286,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,">> Hands in, I'll do it.>> I'll do it."
287,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,>> I'll do it.>> All right.
288,00:18:59.75,00:18:59.75,>> I love you guys.>> I love you guys!
289,00:19:01.58,00:19:01.58,"This is it.>> Okay, done."

291,00:19:08.62,00:19:08.62,"tight alliance.But the problem is, it seems"
292,00:19:13.17,00:19:13.17,"like there's another foursomeout here, and that is Amanda and"
293,00:19:17.00,00:19:17.00,Ozzy and Parvati and James.We're very concerned about that
294,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,foursome.And we were worried they would
295,00:19:22.42,00:19:22.42,try to pull in Fairplay andCirie.
296,00:19:25.25,00:19:25.25,We need a fifth.We need a fifth.
297,00:19:27.79,00:19:27.79,>> I say Fairplay.Yeah.
298,00:19:29.33,00:19:29.33,>> Wait a minute.>> Yeah.

304,00:19:52.79,00:19:52.79,>> We are a little wary of Elizajust hearing about the way she
305,00:19:56.17,00:19:56.17,"played the game in Vanuatu.She's shifty, crafty."
306,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,Some of us just feel like wecan't trust her.
307,00:20:04.33,00:20:04.33,">> I'm easy, man.Trust me."
308,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,>> I'm a little nervous becauseFairplay's got his villain
309,00:20:10.67,00:20:10.67,"persona to live up to, so maybehe will just betray everyone he"
310,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,can.I don't know.
311,00:20:15.96,00:20:15.96,"But at this point, we needFairplay to make a strong"

326,00:21:01.33,00:21:01.33,Ozzy could never...I think we should take Parvati
327,00:21:03.12,00:21:03.12,out first.I think Parvati is a much bigger
328,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,threat as a social player thanOzzy is.
329,00:21:10.54,00:21:10.54,">> Fairplay pretends he's withthem, and I act like everything"
330,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,is perfect.>> I'll play the game.
331,00:21:15.33,00:21:15.33,>> Fairplay's a gem to have onyour alliance.
332,00:21:20.42,00:21:20.42,He needs us much more than weneed him.
333,00:21:22.75,00:21:22.75,You keep him around for as longas possible.
334,00:21:24.33,00:21:24.33,"Hell, I'd take Fairplay to theend if I could."
335,00:21:26.12,00:21:26.12,Do they think you are with them?>> Yeah.

338,00:21:36.96,00:21:36.96,Have you not watched the showbefore?
339,00:21:47.67,00:21:47.67,>> Yau-Man!Do you think you have enough sun

345,00:22:09.21,00:22:09.21,enough that this should work.It worked in Fiji.
