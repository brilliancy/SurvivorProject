6,00:00:13.83,00:00:13.83,years ago. So I guess I don't have to tell
7,00:00:17.17,00:00:17.17,"them. >> PROBST: At Nakum, right"
8,00:00:19.04,00:00:19.04,"before the challenge, things were not looking good for Blake."
9,00:00:21.88,00:00:21.88,">> Yeah, it's bad, man. >> He's struggling to"
10,00:00:24.12,00:00:24.12,"get breaths, and something's not right."

14,00:00:34.12,00:00:34.12,"end, Blake made a comeback and led Nakum to victory."
15,00:00:38.46,00:00:38.46,Nakum wins reward! Nakum put their new fishing gear
16,00:00:43.08,00:00:43.08,to good use. >> I got one. I got one.
17,00:00:45.21,00:00:45.21,>> Yes! Yes! >> Breakfast.
18,00:00:49.08,00:00:49.08,">> PROBST: At Yaxha, the food situation was grim."

22,00:00:59.88,00:00:59.88,there? >> Ten little minnows.
23,00:01:01.25,00:01:01.25,>> That's a minnow each. >> You know what they
24,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,"say, the way to a man's heart is through their stomachs."
25,00:01:06.46,00:01:06.46,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, both tribes duked it"
26,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,out in a difficult tug-of-war mud bath.
27,00:01:11.62,00:01:11.62,"When the challenge moved to individual face-offs, Danni gave"
28,00:01:14.58,00:01:14.58,Yaxha a clue to Gary's true identity.
29,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,>> He's a quarterback. You're like a linebacker.
30,00:01:19.04,00:01:19.04,Come on. >> PROBST: Judd went on to
31,00:01:22.17,00:01:22.17,dominate the challenge and pulled Nakum to victory.
32,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,Judd makes a big pull! This challenge is over!
33,00:01:28.00,00:01:28.00,"Nakum wins immunity! With Tribal Council looming,"
34,00:01:30.00,00:01:30.00,Brian questioned Gary about his past.
35,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,">> Gary, were you a former NFL quarterback?"
36,00:01:36.00,00:01:36.00,>> Me? >> Yeah.
37,00:01:38.00,00:01:38.00,>> No. I'm just going to deny
38,00:01:40.79,00:01:40.79,I played in the NFL because I think I would be voted off
39,00:01:43.71,00:01:43.71,immediately. >> PROBST: Eventually it was
40,00:01:45.42,00:01:45.42,Lydia and Morgan on the chopping block.
41,00:01:47.75,00:01:47.75,">> Longevity-wise, who do you think will be better?"
42,00:01:49.96,00:01:49.96,>> Lydia is limited in the challenges.
43,00:01:51.83,00:01:51.83,But Morgan doesn't do very much in camp.
44,00:01:54.33,00:01:54.33,>> PROBST: Brian scrambled to save Lydia.
45,00:01:56.25,00:01:56.25,">> I told her, I said ""Lydia, it's not looking good"
46,00:01:58.75,00:01:58.75,"for you,"" because she needs to know."
47,00:02:00.46,00:02:00.46,>> PROBST: So Lydia made a plea to Gary.
48,00:02:02.33,00:02:02.33,">> I'm not ready to go, Gary. >> PROBST: The plea worked."
49,00:02:06.96,00:02:06.96,At Tribal Council Lydia was spared and Morgan got a big
50,00:02:10.04,00:02:10.04,surprise when she was voted out of Yaxha.
51,00:02:13.33,00:02:13.33,"Morgan, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left-- who will be voted"

56,00:04:00.00,00:04:00.00,"got voted out, but I really believe that my head was on the"
57,00:04:04.17,00:04:04.17,chopping block. I'm a hard worker.
58,00:04:06.29,00:04:06.29,"You know, I don't deserve to go. The person that I would have"
59,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,chose would have been Brianna. Because she's kind of on the
60,00:04:12.88,00:04:12.88,"weak side, and we need a strong tribe."
61,00:04:15.50,00:04:15.50,"We have to start winning. >> Oh, yeah."
62,00:04:23.42,00:04:23.42,I've been hearing that thunder for a little bit now.
63,00:04:31.88,00:04:31.88,>> I don't get along with Lydia. We don't fight.
64,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,"I'm cordial with her, but she's just not my cup of tea."
65,00:04:41.29,00:04:41.29,">> Day seven. >> Guys, no more Tribal Council,"
66,00:04:45.08,00:04:45.08,okay? That sucks.
67,00:04:47.17,00:04:47.17,>> I actually had no idea how it was gonna turn out.
68,00:04:49.29,00:04:49.29,I was just hoping. >> It was a last-minute pull
69,00:04:51.00,00:04:51.00,that I thought worked out good. >> Last night was so great.
70,00:04:55.25,00:04:55.25,I was so happy with the outcome. That was 100% me.
71,00:04:58.67,00:04:58.67,"I engineered Morgan's ouster. But if Lydia had to go next, I"
72,00:05:07.46,00:05:07.46,wouldn't throw a big fit about it.
73,00:05:10.04,00:05:10.04,'Cause I will do whatever I need to do to make sure it's going my
74,00:05:13.88,00:05:13.88,way. ( loud screeching )
75,00:05:36.58,00:05:36.58,">> I believe it's day seven. In seven days, I probably slept"
76,00:05:40.12,00:05:40.12,a couple of hours. They got this damn monkey up
77,00:05:43.33,00:05:43.33,here that's just driving me out of my mind.
78,00:05:46.54,00:05:46.54,"( screeching continues ) I mean, I don't know how anybody"
79,00:05:52.08,00:05:52.08,"could sleep through that, if they're saying they're sleeping"
80,00:05:54.25,00:05:54.25,"through that. >> No, they are loud."
81,00:06:10.21,00:06:10.21,( screeching continues ) >> How can I complain about
82,00:06:12.92,00:06:12.92,being woken up by howler monkeys in Guatemala?
83,00:06:16.25,00:06:16.25,People pay money to do that. They've got all this loose skin
84,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,"in their throat, and it gets all big like a bowling ball, and"
85,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,they let the air out and it makes that crazy noise.
86,00:06:25.88,00:06:25.88,>> It's absolutely miserable. It just goes on and on.
87,00:06:30.00,00:06:30.00,"And then we've got like a zookeeper here, Cindy."
88,00:06:32.04,00:06:32.04,"She's like, almost like a Dr. Dolittle."
89,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,The monkey's lost and he's looking for the brother that's
90,00:06:37.08,00:06:37.08,all the way across the other side of the jungle.
91,00:06:40.12,00:06:40.12,"And I'm like, dude... That is the most annoyingest"
92,00:06:44.17,00:06:44.17,noise I've ever heard in my entire life.
93,00:06:46.21,00:06:46.21,"It just, it really, it just drives you crazy, man."
94,00:06:49.08,00:06:49.08,It makes you nuts. ( screeching continues )
95,00:07:06.88,00:07:06.88,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Nakum, getting your first look"
96,00:07:17.96,00:07:17.96,at the new Yaxha tribe. Morgan voted out at the last

98,00:07:28.12,00:07:28.12,"challenge. Here in Guatemala, you guys are"
99,00:07:31.04,00:07:31.04,surrounded by ruins that are in various stages of excavation by
100,00:07:36.25,00:07:36.25,archaeologists who are searching for more clues into the Maya
101,00:07:39.58,00:07:39.58,culture. That plays into today's
102,00:07:41.29,00:07:41.29,challenge. You're going to build an
103,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,archaeologist's tent. You will be blindfolded and tied

105,00:07:50.62,00:07:50.62,your set of eyes. They will guide you.
106,00:07:53.12,00:07:53.12,Scattered amongst these ruins will be nine bundles of items.
107,00:07:56.21,00:07:56.21,"Once you've found all nine bundles, take off your"
108,00:07:59.17,00:07:59.17,"blindfolds, start putting the tent together."

110,00:08:06.96,00:08:06.96,all together. First tribe to complete it
111,00:08:09.58,00:08:09.58,correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're playing

193,00:11:43.08,00:11:43.08,Underneath. >> What the hell?
194,00:11:44.54,00:11:44.54,>> PROBST: A lot of confusion at Yaxha.
195,00:11:47.17,00:11:47.17,">> Go. Raise it, raise it, raise it."

209,00:12:16.08,00:12:16.08,Ropes go on the other side poles!

223,00:13:06.25,00:13:06.25,calling. You fell apart when it came to
224,00:13:08.38,00:13:08.38,putting the tent together. I got nothing for you.
225,00:13:10.62,00:13:10.62,"Head on back to camp. Nakum, good job, kept it"
226,00:13:17.08,00:13:17.08,"together, didn't panic, caught up, won a nice reward."
227,00:13:20.83,00:13:20.83,Get your stuff. Head on back to camp.
228,00:13:41.71,00:13:41.71,>> The reward challenge was so easy.
229,00:13:43.96,00:13:43.96,"I mean, we were like totally in the lead, and then we all start"
230,00:13:46.12,00:13:46.12,"building like lunatics, and it was just, like, a big..."
231,00:13:49.96,00:13:49.96,cluster mess. I did not even want that reward.
232,00:13:53.58,00:13:53.58,I just wanted to win. >> So close! Gosh!
233,00:13:59.25,00:13:59.25,>> I'm just hoping that it's so early on in this game that we're
234,00:14:02.96,00:14:02.96,"going to pull it out. I believe that can happen, I"
235,00:14:05.42,00:14:05.42,really do. I've been in worse situations.
236,00:14:07.08,00:14:07.08,( laughs ) >> We can't afford to lose
237,00:14:09.50,00:14:09.50,those. >> That was the easiest
238,00:14:11.17,00:14:11.17,"challenge ever. >> Yeah, but we lost it."
239,00:14:12.92,00:14:12.92,That's what sucks. >> I know.
240,00:14:14.46,00:14:14.46,>> It sucks to lose. You get down for about two
241,00:14:17.04,00:14:17.04,"minutes, and then you come back strong."
242,00:14:19.96,00:14:19.96,"You know, I don't feel fantastic, but I know what I"
243,00:14:21.88,00:14:21.88,have to do to make it out here. >> I've been sleeping in it for
244,00:14:28.21,00:14:28.21,"seven days, and I'm loving it! Does anybody else's clothes look"
245,00:14:32.25,00:14:32.25,like that? Why are you laughing?
246,00:14:33.83,00:14:33.83,"Do your clothes look like that? >> If you boil it, it might"
247,00:14:36.96,00:14:36.96,help. >> This is gonna rot.
248,00:14:38.12,00:14:38.12,I can't believe I'm living like this.
249,00:14:39.50,00:14:39.50,"If you think about it, like, no soap, we're brushing our teeth"
250,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,with a tree. We're going to the bathroom and
251,00:14:45.83,00:14:45.83,using leaves. One pair of underwear.
252,00:14:48.21,00:14:48.21,"This is torture. >> Yeah, but the worst thing is,"
253,00:14:50.21,00:14:50.21,"it's only day seven. It gets, like, a lot worse."
254,00:14:52.54,00:14:52.54,">> Listen, you're in paradise, look-it."
255,00:14:54.29,00:14:54.29,">> Yeah, paradise, we can't even swim, we can't even go"
256,00:14:57.62,00:14:57.62,swimming and have a water game because there's crocs in there
257,00:15:00.42,00:15:00.42,"that might bite our butts. >> Hey, you're not working at"
258,00:15:02.88,00:15:02.88,the police station. >> That's a walk in the park
259,00:15:04.46,00:15:04.46,"compared to this. I have no outdoor experience,"
260,00:15:07.83,00:15:07.83,absolutely nothing. But could I hack it out here 39
261,00:15:10.83,00:15:10.83,days? Absolutely.
262,00:15:14.12,00:15:14.12,I'll never give up. You'll have to stick needles in
263,00:15:16.12,00:15:16.12,"my eyeballs, I'm still not going to give up."
264,00:15:18.38,00:15:18.38,"I don't care how bad it gets, I will not give up."
265,00:15:28.75,00:15:28.75,>> We did it. >> We're on a streak.
266,00:15:30.79,00:15:30.79,">> Four to one, baby, four to one."
267,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,">> One game at a time, you know? >> And just enjoy the moment,"
268,00:15:35.33,00:15:35.33,man. >> Feeling real good.
269,00:15:38.38,00:15:38.38,"We won our reward challenge today, and I'm not too used to"
270,00:15:42.04,00:15:42.04,"winning, so it felt good to win. >> Let's all take a breather and"
271,00:15:45.04,00:15:45.04,regroup here. >> Yeah.
272,00:15:46.42,00:15:46.42,>> We deserve a rest. ( groans )
273,00:15:54.12,00:15:54.12,">> We think we want to build a better shelter, just put the"
274,00:15:56.67,00:15:56.67,"tarp up, but we got to wait for the heat to pass."
275,00:16:04.38,00:16:04.38,The heat's definitely taken its toll on getting work done.
276,00:16:08.92,00:16:08.92,">> This is hotter than Texas. >> Yeah, it is hotter than"
277,00:16:10.92,00:16:10.92,Texas. >> It's Arizona with the
278,00:16:12.54,00:16:12.54,"humidity. >> Who cares, man?"
279,00:16:14.46,00:16:14.46,"Let's just get in the water, dude."
280,00:16:16.21,00:16:16.21,Y'all ready? You ready? >> I'm ready to dive right in.
281,00:16:19.62,00:16:19.62,>> This is definitely one of the toughest things I've ever done
282,00:16:22.38,00:16:22.38,"in my entire life. I mean, the heat is beating the"
283,00:16:25.17,00:16:25.17,"crap out of us, and then can't really jump in the water to cool"
284,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,off because of the alligators. >> You shoving off?
285,00:16:31.71,00:16:31.71,">> Yeah, man, we're going out. >> We're not going out far,"
286,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,right? >> The crocs are around here.
287,00:16:35.92,00:16:35.92,We got to go out a little bit further.
288,00:16:37.29,00:16:37.29,>> They're all over. >> They're all over.
289,00:16:39.75,00:16:39.75,">> It's just so hot out, and, God, that water is just so"
290,00:16:42.62,00:16:42.62,tempting. >> Who's not going?
291,00:16:48.71,00:16:48.71,">> That's all right. >> I'm going to get off, too."
292,00:16:51.58,00:16:51.58,I'm not getting in there. I've worked with alligators.
293,00:16:53.83,00:16:53.83,"They behave like crocs do, and I know they're out there,"
294,00:16:56.75,00:16:56.75,even though we can't see them. There's probably hundreds in
295,00:16:58.67,00:16:58.67,"this lake, if not more. >> We're touching or no?"
296,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,"Uh, yeah, we're touching a little bit."
297,00:17:08.88,00:17:08.88,>> Everybody watches each other's backs for the
298,00:17:10.54,00:17:10.54,"crocodiles, we'll be all right, man."
299,00:17:12.08,00:17:12.08,">> Yeah, just look, man. >> Eventually, you just say"
300,00:17:15.58,00:17:15.58,"screw it, man, I'll just jump in, chance it."
301,00:17:19.25,00:17:19.25,"Live on the edge a little bit, you know?"
302,00:17:21.96,00:17:21.96,>> They think they're safe 'cause they're in the deep part.
303,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,But alligators go deeper when it gets hot.
304,00:17:26.04,00:17:26.04,They have to regulate their own body temperature so they're
305,00:17:28.29,00:17:28.29,deeper right now. They don't care.
306,00:17:31.12,00:17:31.12,They're taking the risk. They can do what they want.
307,00:17:33.88,00:17:33.88,">> I have to get up. >> Yeah, baby, go ahead."
308,00:17:41.12,00:17:41.12,">> The brave may not live long, but the cautious don't live at"
309,00:17:44.33,00:17:44.33,all. And I've never felt more alive
310,00:17:47.25,00:17:47.25,in my entire life. ( laughs )
311,00:18:07.58,00:18:07.58,">> I'm pulling my workload around camp, because I'm mostly"
312,00:18:10.79,00:18:10.79,worried about what my tribe sees me as.
313,00:18:12.83,00:18:12.83,I want to be considered an asset on this tribe.
314,00:18:15.75,00:18:15.75,"You have to be a provider, and I believe I am."
315,00:18:19.58,00:18:19.58,"Guys, come get it while it's hot 'cause it might stick."
316,00:18:22.75,00:18:22.75,>> Dinner's the same old corn mush.
317,00:18:25.04,00:18:25.04,"It's similar to oatmeal, but not as good."
318,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,"Sort of crunchy, like a crunchy, softish..."
319,00:18:31.71,00:18:31.71,"stuck-in-your-teeth kind of meal, I guess you could say."
320,00:18:35.21,00:18:35.21,>> I'm already getting sick of this smell.
321,00:18:37.96,00:18:37.96,">> Come on, dude, I can't eat this corn."
322,00:18:39.96,00:18:39.96,">> Mmm! Everybody, mmm!"
323,00:18:42.21,00:18:42.21,">> We have been eating the same taste every meal, every"
324,00:18:45.46,00:18:45.46,"day, and we just need something else."
325,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,"Like, even throwing dirt in the corn almost makes it taste"
326,00:18:50.46,00:18:50.46,"better because it's something different, and that's all we're"
327,00:18:53.96,00:18:53.96,"craving right now. Like, anything different, we"
328,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,will eat. >> Look at that?
329,00:18:59.12,00:18:59.12,>> What is that? >> They said it's termites.
330,00:19:02.67,00:19:02.67,">> That's disgusting. >> Ew, stop it."
331,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,">> Well, I just want to see... >> Please don't do that."
332,00:19:08.25,00:19:08.25,"I'm not going to be your friend anymore, Rafe."
333,00:19:11.21,00:19:11.21,>> If I eat termites? >> Yeah.
334,00:19:13.29,00:19:13.29,">> Ew, Rafe! >> They taste good."
335,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,">> Gary, please, stop doing that or I'm not going to be your"
336,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"friend, either. >> Did you like them, Gary?"
337,00:19:19.54,00:19:19.54,">> Oh, yeah. >> I think that they're better"
338,00:19:21.21,00:19:21.21,than those ants we had. There's probably more fat in
339,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,them. >> Why don't you cook them up
340,00:19:24.75,00:19:24.75,then? Don't like eat them alive.
341,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,>> Today was a day of interesting food items.
342,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,"We started eating termites. They were good protein, not good"
343,00:19:32.42,00:19:32.42,tasting. >> Good?
344,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,>> Protein. >> What do you guys want to do
345,00:19:44.58,00:19:44.58,with this stuff right now? >> We could put it over our
346,00:19:46.33,00:19:46.33,existing shelter. >> We'd get more use out of it
347,00:19:50.08,00:19:50.08,if we tied it up. >> I agree.
348,00:19:51.46,00:19:51.46,>> There was a little bit of discussion on how to put the
349,00:19:54.92,00:19:54.92,tarp on. People always have different
350,00:19:56.62,00:19:56.62,"ideas on how things should be done, but, you know, we all work"
351,00:19:59.58,00:19:59.58,"as a team. >> Well, I want to go here, and"
352,00:20:01.46,00:20:01.46,then I'm gonna go to that corner and tie it and go all the way
353,00:20:04.62,00:20:04.62,around it. >> The guys are trying to
354,00:20:06.04,00:20:06.04,"construct a canopy for us to sleep under, but it's just"
355,00:20:09.12,00:20:09.12,"interesting how it's taking, you know, a while."
356,00:20:12.75,00:20:12.75,">> This thing's so heavy, if rain were to pool on top of it,"
357,00:20:15.08,00:20:15.08,it'll collapse. >> Why don't we all pull a
358,00:20:17.58,00:20:17.58,"corner? >> Um, if you're going to slant"
359,00:20:19.71,00:20:19.71,"it, you got to decide which way you want to slant it."
360,00:20:22.92,00:20:22.92,"The way this is, if you have it on there, the canopy may just go"
361,00:20:26.21,00:20:26.21,"like this, slide along the string like this."
362,00:20:29.25,00:20:29.25,"So knot it so it doesn't slide, and then do your others."
363,00:20:35.71,00:20:35.71,">> You know, we don't need a supervisor."
364,00:20:37.71,00:20:37.71,"This thing is supposed to be fun, you know?"
365,00:20:39.71,00:20:39.71,>> Ready? >> Yeah.
366,00:20:44.00,00:20:44.00,>> I don't understand how they were putting it together 'cause
367,00:20:46.54,00:20:46.54,"it was supposed to be a lean. It looks like we got a, uh,"
368,00:20:51.33,00:20:51.33,circus big top for a shelter. Am I impressed?
369,00:20:56.88,00:20:56.88,"( chuckles ): No answer. >> You have no idea, man."
370,00:21:05.62,00:21:05.62,">> Margaret pretty much hand- directed building the tent, and,"
371,00:21:09.54,00:21:09.54,"I don't know, I'm 28 years old. You just can't tell grown men"
372,00:21:13.12,00:21:13.12,what to do all the time. >> She's playing that mother hen
373,00:21:16.12,00:21:16.12,role. >> Yeah.

375,00:21:19.83,00:21:19.83,"I'm like you, man, I'm basically just here to have fun, man, and"
376,00:21:23.67,00:21:23.67,experience it all. As soon as somebody comes in and
377,00:21:26.58,00:21:26.58,"tries to enforce all these rules, that ain't fun, man."
378,00:21:31.46,00:21:31.46,"Margaret just comes in, ""We need this, we need that,"""

380,00:21:36.29,00:21:36.29,Starting to bark orders this early is-is not a good thing.
381,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,Nobody's going to tell me what to do.
382,00:21:42.21,00:21:42.21,"The only people who tell me what to do is my boss and my wife,"

384,00:22:08.04,00:22:08.04,">> Exciting, exciting! >> Let's see what it says."
385,00:22:12.88,00:22:12.88,">> ""The ancient Maya civilization embraced sport."

387,00:22:17.46,00:22:17.46,ceremonial garb and body paint. When a team of warriors would
388,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,"lose, the cost would be a human sacrifice."
389,00:22:23.08,00:22:23.08,"You will do the same tonight at Tribal Council."""

397,00:22:46.25,00:22:46.25,Can I put a feather in your hair?
398,00:22:47.96,00:22:47.96,Nakum is such a strong tribe. We've won four out of the five
399,00:22:51.46,00:22:51.46,challenges now. So there's no reason why we
400,00:22:54.12,00:22:54.12,shouldn't go in and win this one.
401,00:22:59.04,00:22:59.04,">> Guys, we are going to win! ( whooping )"

405,00:23:08.38,00:23:08.38,"just do it, and win, guys! >> Guys, for Yaxha."
406,00:23:11.21,00:23:11.21,"One, two, three, Yaxha! >> This immunity challenge is"
407,00:23:14.75,00:23:14.75,really important because we don't want to go to Tribal
408,00:23:17.71,00:23:17.71,Council. We don't want to lose any more
409,00:23:19.54,00:23:19.54,of my members. Do I look like I can kick
410,00:23:21.62,00:23:21.62,"somebody's butt? Hopefully, I'll be a star out"
411,00:23:24.04,00:23:24.04,"there. Hopefully, I'll do something"
412,00:23:25.50,00:23:25.50,"that, you know, I won't be the next one on the chopping block."
413,00:23:28.08,00:23:28.08,I don't want to be that way again.
414,00:23:29.75,00:23:29.75,>> How do I look? >> Ah!
415,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,I'm scared of you! Whoo! >> You should be.

417,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,"get people up, ready to go, ready to win."
418,00:23:37.04,00:23:37.04,"Right now in terms of people, we're even, eight to eight."
419,00:23:39.79,00:23:39.79,"So if we win tonight, we'll still be down challenge-wise,"
420,00:23:41.92,00:23:41.92,"but we'll be up people-wise, and that's where it's killer."
421,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,This is so crucial to keep the numbers up on our side.
422,00:23:51.00,00:23:51.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! All right, first things first."

428,00:24:31.88,00:24:31.88,Definitely plays into the challenge.
429,00:24:34.25,00:24:34.25,Let's get to today's immunity challenge.
430,00:24:36.62,00:24:36.62,"It is based on the oldest and the most popular of Maya games,"
431,00:24:39.79,00:24:39.79,"called court ball. Playing on an elevated court,"
432,00:24:43.46,00:24:43.46,"you will square off three versus three, attempting to score a"
433,00:24:47.92,00:24:47.92,point for your tribe by tossing this ball through one of your
434,00:24:50.83,00:24:50.83,two hoops. This is a catch-and-pass game.
435,00:24:54.71,00:24:54.71,"That means when you catch it, you have to pass it."
436,00:24:57.21,00:24:57.21,You cannot run or walk with the ball.
437,00:25:00.21,00:25:00.21,First tribe to score five points wins.
438,00:25:04.21,00:25:04.21,Make sense? At stake?
439,00:25:06.29,00:25:06.29,"Well, when the Maya played, the losing tribe sacrificed a"
440,00:25:09.00,00:25:09.00,member. You will do basically the same
441,00:25:10.88,00:25:10.88,thing tonight-- losers voting somebody out at Tribal Council.
442,00:25:15.04,00:25:15.04,"For each round, the teams of three will be randomly drawn."
443,00:25:18.21,00:25:18.21,We're going to start with three men versus three men and mix it
444,00:25:21.08,00:25:21.08,"up from there. Take a spot up on the platform,"

564,00:32:06.04,00:32:06.04,">> Yeah, here we go again. I'm on this tribe that doesn't"
565,00:32:08.96,00:32:08.96,"seem to be too good at winning in the beginning, and someone"
566,00:32:11.21,00:32:11.21,sprains their ankle. It's horrible.
567,00:32:13.38,00:32:13.38,I've already been here. I've already done this.
568,00:32:15.25,00:32:15.25,I can't do it again. I've only dehydrated like that
569,00:32:18.75,00:32:18.75,once in my entire life. I was trying not to cry 'cause
570,00:32:21.04,00:32:21.04,I wanted to hold all the water in.
571,00:32:22.58,00:32:22.58,">> Steph, don't be mad at yourself."
572,00:32:24.08,00:32:24.08,"We got to keep positive, you know what I mean?"
573,00:32:27.17,00:32:27.17,">> I'm frustrated because we have Amy, she's got all the"
574,00:32:29.67,00:32:29.67,"strength in the world, and she can't run."
575,00:32:31.62,00:32:31.62,And we have Brianna who's a makeup artist.
576,00:32:33.67,00:32:33.67,"After the first round, she's like this-- her head's"
577,00:32:35.88,00:32:35.88,completely up her butt. I have to literally pull it out.
578,00:32:38.12,00:32:38.12,"I'm like, ""Dude, it's too early in the game-- what are you"
579,00:32:40.79,00:32:40.79,"doing?"" Then we have a fish monger, who"
580,00:32:43.08,00:32:43.08,"I do love dearly because she tries her best, but she's"
581,00:32:45.29,00:32:45.29,"really not athletic at all. Part of me just wishes, like,"
582,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,"why, why, just once can't I just be on a great tribe?"
583,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,"I want to see her. Oh, my God, Amy."
584,00:32:54.96,00:32:54.96,">> It's good, it's all good. I can feel it falling off."
585,00:32:58.21,00:32:58.21,"I love this! Snap, snap."
586,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,">> Did you hear it snap? >> Oh, yeah, I snapped both"
587,00:33:02.12,00:33:02.12,sides. >> I rolled my ankle the
588,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,"first game I went out there. It's swollen, but it's"
589,00:33:06.04,00:33:06.04,definitely something I can live with.
590,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,"I'm not going to, you know, give up."
591,00:33:10.42,00:33:10.42,I got to make sure my team knows I'm going to be all right.
592,00:33:16.83,00:33:16.83,">> High-five, baby, gimme some. Don't worry. Hey..."
593,00:33:20.25,00:33:20.25,">> All right. >> And be honest with us, too."
594,00:33:22.38,00:33:22.38,>> I'm fine. My ankle would have to be
595,00:33:24.08,00:33:24.08,"falling off before I ever quit. It might be a little painful,"
596,00:33:27.71,00:33:27.71,but it's going to be fine. >> Two of our girls don't
597,00:33:31.04,00:33:31.04,"have a clue. >> I explained what a pick was,"
598,00:33:33.21,00:33:33.21,and they didn't do it. >> Lydia has never played a
599,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,"sport in her life. Our team is totally down,"
600,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,because we got two people that never played a sport in
601,00:33:40.04,00:33:40.04,their life in Lydia and Brianna. Amy sprained her ankle.
602,00:33:44.12,00:33:44.12,"With these challenges, if you had a sprained ankle, it would"
603,00:33:46.79,00:33:46.79,"be tough, so, uh, that's big, 'cause we need to win."
604,00:33:57.58,00:33:57.58,">> Jamie, you know I gave it my heart."
605,00:34:00.08,00:34:00.08,">> I know, I saw you. You were out there hustling."
606,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,>> She knows she's done. >> 'Cause I had a feeling it
607,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,would have been a toss between me and her.
608,00:34:11.62,00:34:11.62,>> We're going to Tribal Council tonight to vote Brianna out.
609,00:34:14.17,00:34:14.17,She's done. Brianna's last day on
610,00:34:16.62,00:34:16.62,Survivor is tonight. Day eight.
611,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,"Well, that girl makes me sick. She was leaning on a pole."
612,00:34:22.71,00:34:22.71,"Literally, leaning on a pole. You don't do that."
613,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,"There's three people out there, they're all busting ass."
614,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,"You know, they're all working hard and then, she's leaning"
615,00:34:31.25,00:34:31.25,against the pole. So there were only two people
616,00:34:33.46,00:34:33.46,out there working so hard. She won't say anything to me
617,00:34:35.92,00:34:35.92,because she knows I'll tell her right to her face.
618,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,"I'm going to vote her off. Everybody knew from day one, I"
619,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,don't like Brianna. She annoys me.
620,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,Not my type of girl. I like them crazy and pretty.
621,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,"She's neither. >> Like you said, she probably"
622,00:34:48.17,00:34:48.17,"knows herself, huh? >> She'll try to fight it,"
623,00:34:50.29,00:34:50.29,but there's nothing she can do. >> I love this game.
624,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,Why would I be here if I didn't? >> Obviously.
625,00:35:02.58,00:35:02.58,>> Why would I be here if I didn't think I could?
626,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,>> Right. >> I'm here because I can.
627,00:35:07.92,00:35:07.92,>> I know you can. >> I feel scared because the
628,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,"weak link today was probably me, and then I know Jamie and Lydia"
629,00:35:15.62,00:35:15.62,would have me out of here if they could.
630,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,"I'm voting for Lydia because when I talk to people, I look at"
631,00:35:21.54,00:35:21.54,them in the eyes. >> Right.
632,00:35:22.83,00:35:22.83,>> I've never seen her eyes. She doesn't like me anyway.
633,00:35:25.96,00:35:25.96,>> Lydia? Really? >> Mm.
634,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,>> Why? >> I can tell.
635,00:35:30.33,00:35:30.33,I told you I'm good at reading people.
636,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,">> Yeah, you did tell me that. >> My vote tonight is based on"
637,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,"who I can trust and who I've built relationships with, and I"
638,00:35:38.75,00:35:38.75,haven't built that bond with Lydia.
639,00:35:42.25,00:35:42.25,>> Is that too tight? >> Let's go.
640,00:35:44.79,00:35:44.79,">> Let's go. >> From now on, it's all"
641,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,about who's athletic or not. We can't lose anymore.
642,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,"You can have all the heart in the world, but if you can't"
643,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,"hang, you're lost. There's no doubt out here right"
644,00:35:56.08,00:35:56.08,now athletic ability means the most.
645,00:36:29.54,00:36:29.54,>> PROBST: Welcome back to Tribal Council.
646,00:36:31.92,00:36:31.92,"Steph, is it too early to ask if this is feeling a little"
647,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"familiar, a little deja vu? >> I'm having some horrible"
648,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,"flashbacks, that's for sure, just that feeling again of"
649,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,"losing, and having to come here, and having to get rid of another"
650,00:36:45.54,00:36:45.54,person. It makes me sick.
651,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,">> PROBST: At today's immunity challenge, there were times"
652,00:36:49.08,00:36:49.08,"where it seemed like you were looking around going, ""Give me"
653,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,"some help here."" >> Yeah, I was completely"
654,00:36:53.62,00:36:53.62,"frustrated today during the challenge, and, you know, I was"
655,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,"out there with Lydia and Brianna, and, you know, they"
656,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,"haven't really played sports, and they didn't know what a pick"
657,00:37:00.92,00:37:00.92,"was, and it's frustrating but they were doing their best, and"
658,00:37:03.00,00:37:03.00,obviously our best was not good enough because we got beat.
659,00:37:07.71,00:37:07.71,">> PROBST: Brianna, is it fair to come down on you because you"
660,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,didn't know what a pick was? >> I don't think anyone was
661,00:37:12.92,00:37:12.92,coming down on me for not ever playing basketball and not
662,00:37:16.46,00:37:16.46,"knowing the terminology. I gave it my best, honestly, I"
663,00:37:19.79,00:37:19.79,"did. >> PROBST: Lydia, I'll give it"
664,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,"to you, you were trying. I don't know if you were much"
665,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,more effective than Brianna was. What do you think?
666,00:37:27.71,00:37:27.71,">> Well, Jeff, I sucked today. But, you know, I was in there,"
667,00:37:31.92,00:37:31.92,and I was doing my best. Anything that would help the
668,00:37:34.62,00:37:34.62,"tribe, grabbing the ball, stealing from it, anything."
669,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,"And I just put my heart into it, and never gave up."
670,00:37:41.04,00:37:41.04,">> PROBST: Brian, you think this tribe's out-matched?"
671,00:37:43.92,00:37:43.92,">> The other tribe is extremely athletic, perhaps more athletic"
672,00:37:46.62,00:37:46.62,"than we are, but we have determination and will, and we"
673,00:37:49.17,00:37:49.17,really are not out-matched in how much we like each other.
674,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,I can't imagine the other tribe being as unified as we are.
675,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,>> PROBST: Let's talk about the wear and tear from today's
676,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,"challenge. Amy, I noticed when you came in,"
677,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,"you were hobbling a little bit. >> When I first went out there,"
678,00:38:02.71,00:38:02.71,"I just turned my ankle. But I didn't break it, so I'm"
679,00:38:05.62,00:38:05.62,"good to go. >> PROBST: Gary, when you see"
680,00:38:09.08,00:38:09.08,"some of these injuries, does it go through your head, you know,"
681,00:38:11.42,00:38:11.42,"we got to keep the strong, got to get rid of the weak?"
682,00:38:14.12,00:38:14.12,">> Well, we're definitely at a point right now, Jeff, that"
683,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,"athleticism is big. The reality is, if you can't"
684,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"help us in the challenges, it's going to hurt us as a team and"
685,00:38:23.04,00:38:23.04,"we're not going to get anywhere. >> PROBST: Amy, you come in"
686,00:38:26.71,00:38:26.71,"here, you're injured. All we talked about tonight is"
687,00:38:29.38,00:38:29.38,"physical, physical, physical. How frustrating would it be to"
688,00:38:32.62,00:38:32.62,go out number three? >> It would be frustrating
689,00:38:35.00,00:38:35.00,"because it would have to be because they think I'm injured,"
690,00:38:37.50,00:38:37.50,but it's not that serious. So don't make the mistake.
691,00:38:43.12,00:38:43.12,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote."
692,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,"Lydia, you're up. >> Lydia, you have not once"
693,00:39:04.12,00:39:04.12,looked me in the eye when I've spoken to you or even attempted
694,00:39:07.79,00:39:07.79,"at conversing. >> You're a girlie-girl, you"
695,00:39:21.04,00:39:21.04,need to go back to the shopping mall when you leave the jungle.
696,00:39:37.71,00:39:37.71,>> I have to do what's right for this tribe right now.
697,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,We've got to win immunity. I can't be on the losing streak
698,00:39:43.83,00:39:43.83,anymore. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
699,00:39:49.83,00:39:49.83,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
700,00:40:02.54,00:40:02.54,decision is final. The person voted out will be
701,00:40:04.75,00:40:04.75,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
702,00:40:07.29,00:40:07.29,I'll read the votes. First vote.
703,00:40:12.08,00:40:12.08,Brianna. Lydia.
704,00:40:21.08,00:40:21.08,"Brianna. Two votes Brianna, one vote"
705,00:40:24.08,00:40:24.08,Lydia. Brianna.
706,00:40:29.08,00:40:29.08,That's three for Brianna. Brianna.
707,00:40:35.42,00:40:35.42,Four votes Brianna. Third person voted out of
708,00:40:41.88,00:40:41.88,Survivor: Guatemala... Brianna. That's five.
709,00:40:44.29,00:40:44.29,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
710,00:40:55.46,00:40:55.46,"Brianna, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
711,00:41:01.46,00:41:01.46,>> You guys are strong. Kick some Nakum butt.
712,00:41:04.12,00:41:04.12,">> Brianna, sweetheart. >> See ya, Bri."
713,00:41:15.96,00:41:15.96,">> PROBST: Well, we're only eight days in, but when it comes"
714,00:41:19.21,00:41:19.21,"to Tribal Council, your strategy seems clear: keep the strong,"
715,00:41:21.88,00:41:21.88,vote out the weak. But in a game this
716,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,"unpredictable, voting based solely on physical strength can"
717,00:41:29.12,00:41:29.12,be risky. See how it plays out.
718,00:41:31.96,00:41:31.96,Grab your torches. Head on back to camp.
