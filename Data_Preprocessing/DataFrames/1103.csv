565,00:32:11.21,00:32:11.21,sprains their ankle.It's horrible.
566,00:32:13.38,00:32:13.38,I've already been here.I've already done this.
567,00:32:15.25,00:32:15.25,I can't do it again.I've only dehydrated like that
568,00:32:18.75,00:32:18.75,once in my entire life.I was trying not to cry 'cause
569,00:32:21.04,00:32:21.04,I wanted to hold all the waterin.
570,00:32:22.58,00:32:22.58,">> Steph, don't be mad atyourself."

574,00:32:31.62,00:32:31.62,And we have Brianna who's amakeup artist.

576,00:32:35.88,00:32:35.88,completely up her butt.I have to literally pull it out.
577,00:32:38.12,00:32:38.12,"I'm like, ""Dude, it's too earlyin the game-- what are you"
578,00:32:40.79,00:32:40.79,"doing?""Then we have a fish monger, who"
579,00:32:43.08,00:32:43.08,"I do love dearly because shetries her best, but she's"
580,00:32:45.29,00:32:45.29,"really not athletic at all.Part of me just wishes, like,"

588,00:33:06.04,00:33:06.04,definitely something I can livewith.
589,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,"I'm not going to, you know,give up."
590,00:33:10.42,00:33:10.42,I got to make sure my teamknows I'm going to be all right.

595,00:33:27.71,00:33:27.71,but it's going to be fine.>> Two of our girls don't
596,00:33:31.04,00:33:31.04,"have a clue.>> I explained what a pick was,"
597,00:33:33.21,00:33:33.21,and they didn't do it.>> Lydia has never played a

599,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,because we got two peoplethat never played a sport in
600,00:33:40.04,00:33:40.04,their life in Lydia and Brianna.Amy sprained her ankle.
601,00:33:44.12,00:33:44.12,"With these challenges, if youhad a sprained ankle, it would"
602,00:33:46.79,00:33:46.79,"be tough, so, uh, that'sbig, 'cause we need to win."
603,00:33:57.58,00:33:57.58,">> Jamie, you know I gave it myheart."
604,00:34:00.08,00:34:00.08,">> I know, I saw you.You were out there hustling."
605,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,>> She knows she's done.>> 'Cause I had a feeling it
606,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,would have been a toss betweenme and her.
607,00:34:11.62,00:34:11.62,>> We're going to Tribal Counciltonight to vote Brianna out.
608,00:34:14.17,00:34:14.17,She's done.Brianna's last day on
609,00:34:16.62,00:34:16.62,Survivor is tonight.Day eight.
610,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,"Well, that girl makes me sick.She was leaning on a pole."
611,00:34:22.71,00:34:22.71,"Literally, leaning on a pole.You don't do that."
612,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,"There's three people out there,they're all busting ass."
613,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,"You know, they're all workinghard and then, she's leaning"
614,00:34:31.25,00:34:31.25,against the pole.So there were only two people
615,00:34:33.46,00:34:33.46,out there working so hard.She won't say anything to me
616,00:34:35.92,00:34:35.92,because she knows I'll tell herright to her face.
617,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,"I'm going to vote her off.Everybody knew from day one, I"
618,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,don't like Brianna.She annoys me.
619,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,Not my type of girl.I like them crazy and pretty.
620,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,"She's neither.>> Like you said, she probably"
621,00:34:48.17,00:34:48.17,"knows herself, huh?>> She'll try to fight it,"
622,00:34:50.29,00:34:50.29,but there's nothing she can do.>> I love this game.
623,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,Why would I be here if I didn't?>> Obviously.
624,00:35:02.58,00:35:02.58,>> Why would I be here if Ididn't think I could?
625,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,>> Right.>> I'm here because I can.
626,00:35:07.92,00:35:07.92,>> I know you can.>> I feel scared because the
627,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,"weak link today was probably me,and then I know Jamie and Lydia"
628,00:35:15.62,00:35:15.62,would have me out of here ifthey could.
629,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,"I'm voting for Lydia becausewhen I talk to people, I look at"
630,00:35:21.54,00:35:21.54,them in the eyes.>> Right.
631,00:35:22.83,00:35:22.83,>> I've never seen her eyes.She doesn't like me anyway.
632,00:35:25.96,00:35:25.96,>> Lydia? Really?>> Mm.
633,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,>> Why?>> I can tell.
634,00:35:30.33,00:35:30.33,I told you I'm good at readingpeople.
635,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,">> Yeah, you did tell me that.>> My vote tonight is based on"
636,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,"who I can trust and who I'vebuilt relationships with, and I"
637,00:35:38.75,00:35:38.75,haven't built that bond withLydia.
638,00:35:42.25,00:35:42.25,>> Is that too tight?>> Let's go.
