1039,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,BUT SHE CAN'T CONTROL IT AT ALL
1040,00:29:42.43,00:29:42.43,AND THAT'S A LIABILITY.

1235,00:35:38.10,00:35:38.10,AND I DID.
1236,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,TODAY.
1237,00:35:41.07,00:35:41.07,Jeff: NINA YOU LOOK LIKE

1242,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
1243,00:35:49.57,00:35:49.57,ATHLETE IS MADE UP OF THREE
1244,00:35:50.83,00:35:50.83,"THINGS: ATHLETIC ABILITY, THE"
1245,00:35:52.23,00:35:52.23,ABILITY TO HANDLE PRESSURE AND
1246,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,TO BE SMART.
1247,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00,"OKAY, SO TODAY NOT ONLY DID SHE"
1248,00:35:56.67,00:35:56.67,"JUMP IN THE WATER ONCE, SHE DID"
1249,00:35:58.67,00:35:58.67,IT TWICE.
1250,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,AND THE ONLY VOICE I HEARD UP
1251,00:36:02.23,00:36:02.23,"THERE, DISTRACTING VOICE, WAS"
1252,00:36:04.07,00:36:04.07,HERS.
1253,00:36:04.60,00:36:04.60,SO SHE CAN'T HANDLE STRESS AND
1254,00:36:06.10,00:36:06.10,SHE MADE A MISTAKE.
1255,00:36:07.50,00:36:07.50,IS SHE AN ATHLETE?
1256,00:36:08.90,00:36:08.90,I DON'T KNOW.
1257,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,BUT THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS AND
1258,00:36:11.03,00:36:11.03,SHE'S FAILED AT TWO.
1259,00:36:12.33,00:36:12.33,"Jeff: KIM, IS PART OF"

1262,00:36:16.37,00:36:16.37,I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.
1263,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,DOES KAT BRING LIFE EXPERIENCE
1264,00:36:19.10,00:36:19.10,TO THE TABLE IN OUR TRIBE?

1266,00:36:21.37,00:36:21.37,BUT I DO THINK KAT IS A GOOD
1267,00:36:22.70,00:36:22.70,ATHLETE.
1268,00:36:23.07,00:36:23.07,DO I THINK NINA HAS LIFE

1281,00:36:38.43,00:36:38.43,GUYS WOULD FORM DIFFERENT
1282,00:36:39.93,00:36:39.93,ALLIANCES.
1283,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,"YEAH, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE"
1284,00:36:43.90,00:36:43.90,DIFFERENT.
1285,00:36:44.33,00:36:44.33,"Jeff: SABRINA, DO YOU AGREE"
1286,00:36:45.60,00:36:45.60,WITH THAT?
1287,00:36:46.27,00:36:46.27,"YES, 100%."
