375,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,>> The game is now just nowgetting interesting
376,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,now that we're having to votepeople off.
377,00:23:50.79,00:23:50.79,I'm very excited.I love that the game is going to
378,00:23:53.46,00:23:53.46,a new level.I can't wait.
379,00:24:02.25,00:24:02.25,">> So we're good?Everything's cool, right?"
380,00:24:04.00,00:24:04.00,>> Yep. We got the plan.>> Right.
381,00:24:07.08,00:24:07.08,">> And I think, you know...>> Right."
382,00:24:08.96,00:24:08.96,">> Willard seems to have a goodattitude about it, too."
383,00:24:12.46,00:24:12.46,">> Right.Nobody wants to go home,"
384,00:24:14.96,00:24:14.96,"but you got to do itwith a stiff upper lip also,"
385,00:24:17.29,00:24:17.29,as most of us will at one timeor another.
386,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,>> So Jenn and I are in themiddle to navigate which way
387,00:24:23.79,00:24:23.79,"we really want to go,and that's a luxury."
388,00:24:30.79,00:24:30.79,"If we wanted to, we could flipfrom the Katie, Tom and Ian"
389,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,side to the Janu and Coby side.And we could start picking off
390,00:24:38.17,00:24:38.17,who I perceive to be the biggerstrengths in Tom and Ian.
391,00:24:43.00,00:24:43.00,"Jenn and I--people look at us as, oh, we're"
392,00:24:46.12,00:24:46.12,"just, like, a cute couple.Well, I think we're thinking"
393,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,a hell of a lot more than them.>> PROBST: Behind each of you is
394,00:25:15.00,00:25:15.00,"a torch.Go ahead and grab a torch,"
395,00:25:18.38,00:25:18.38,and approach the flame.Dip it in and get fire.
396,00:25:21.25,00:25:21.25,This is part of the ritualof Tribal Council.
397,00:25:23.46,00:25:23.46,"As long as you have fire, you'restill in the game."
398,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,"When your fire is gone, so areyou."
399,00:25:28.67,00:25:28.67,That will be the case for one ofyou tonight.
400,00:25:32.96,00:25:32.96,"So we have a lot to cover.Let's talk about relationships,"
401,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,"leadership, friendship.Katie, who's leading this tribe"
402,00:25:43.62,00:25:43.62,right now?>> Depends how you want to
403,00:25:46.71,00:25:46.71,"define ""leader.""At challenges, Tom definitely"
404,00:25:48.42,00:25:48.42,is a leader.If you're looking at leader as
405,00:25:52.29,00:25:52.29,"someone that provides food,that's Ian."
406,00:25:54.38,00:25:54.38,">> PROBST: Tom, did you come inhere to be the leader?"
407,00:25:56.54,00:25:56.54,">> My intention was to come inhere, be the 40-year-old dad,"
408,00:25:59.58,00:25:59.58,fade into the background.I ended up in a tribe
409,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,initially physicallyweaker than the other tribe.
410,00:26:06.54,00:26:06.54,And every one of us hadto turn it on 110% to win those
411,00:26:10.25,00:26:10.25,immunities.And we see the results.
412,00:26:14.25,00:26:14.25,">> PROBST: Coby, are yousocial with this tribe?"
413,00:26:17.50,00:26:17.50,>> I'm very social...which could bite me in the end.
414,00:26:20.71,00:26:20.71,"I get along with everybody.You know, when you're too"
415,00:26:23.54,00:26:23.54,"friendly, and you're too busyof a bee, people watch you too"
416,00:26:25.54,00:26:25.54,"much, I guess.>> PROBST: So what do you do"
417,00:26:30.04,00:26:30.04,to... to counter that?>> I don't care.
418,00:26:31.54,00:26:31.54,I'm just being me.I am social.
419,00:26:33.92,00:26:33.92,I am a butterfly.I do want to talk to everybody.
420,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,"So I just do it, and if thatcosts me the game"
421,00:26:38.25,00:26:38.25,"in the end, well, so be it.>> PROBST: Gregg, what"
422,00:26:40.58,00:26:40.58,friendships have you seendevelop?
423,00:26:44.00,00:26:44.00,Are you starting to noticejust a natural
424,00:26:46.12,00:26:46.12,bonding between people?>> You definitely see that.
425,00:26:49.42,00:26:49.42,Tom and Ian spend a lot of timetogether.
426,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,"You know, it's like a father-sonrelationship."
427,00:26:53.38,00:26:53.38,">> I'm the father.>> But, at the same time, we all"
428,00:26:56.75,00:26:56.75,"appreciate that, you know?It's not something that's hidden"
429,00:26:59.21,00:26:59.21,or secretive.Coby and Janu have been getting
430,00:27:01.79,00:27:01.79,along great.And Willard and Caryn have
431,00:27:04.33,00:27:04.33,been getting along great.Katie's been spreading the
432,00:27:06.62,00:27:06.62,"wealth.She's been, you know, loving"
433,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,"everyone, and everyone'senjoying her company."
434,00:27:11.12,00:27:11.12,>> Thanks.>> Where does that leave Jenn
435,00:27:13.33,00:27:13.33,"and Gregg?>> So, you know, that leaves me"
436,00:27:15.92,00:27:15.92,and Jenn alone.>> PROBST: So that's a different
437,00:27:18.21,00:27:18.21,"type of friendship then?>> We have a strong bond, just"
438,00:27:22.04,00:27:22.04,"as everyone else here, and it'snothing you know, super"
439,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,"intense at this point.>> PROBST: Willard, how do you"
440,00:27:28.08,00:27:28.08,think you are perceived?Probably as one of the weaker
441,00:27:30.79,00:27:30.79,players on the team.I'm not as strong as I thought
442,00:27:34.58,00:27:34.58,I'd be.And I think people
443,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,understand that.Not a good position to be in.
444,00:27:40.29,00:27:40.29,">> PROBST: Gregg, at this point,how big an issue does trust"
445,00:27:43.08,00:27:43.08,become?>> It's about to kick in.
446,00:27:44.83,00:27:44.83,"It's about to really kick in.This is our first time here,"
447,00:27:48.62,00:27:48.62,"and now we're faced with thereality of voting people off,"
448,00:27:52.17,00:27:52.17,and so the trust that we thinkthat we have or hope that we
449,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,have is going to be testedbecause it hasn't been tested
450,00:27:59.04,00:27:59.04,"yet.>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
451,00:28:01.04,00:28:01.04,"vote.Willard, you're up."
452,00:28:25.25,00:28:25.25,>> You're crabby and you'rebitter.
453,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,Bye.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
454,00:28:54.12,00:28:54.12,"votes.Once the votes are read,"

456,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,will be asked to leave theTribal Council area immediately.
457,00:29:11.04,00:29:11.04,I'll read the votes.First vote...

462,00:29:43.12,00:29:43.12,One vote Katie.Fifth person voted
463,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,"out of Survivor: Palau,Willard."
464,00:29:49.12,00:29:49.12,"That's five, that's enough.You need to bring me your torch."
465,00:29:59.96,00:29:59.96,"Willard, the tribe has spoken.It's time for you to go."
466,00:30:05.96,00:30:05.96,">> Stay strong, stick to theplan, finish them off."
467,00:30:09.08,00:30:09.08,"(several saying farewells)>> PROBST: Okay, Koror, you are"
468,00:30:21.67,00:30:21.67,now a tribe of eight.Willard voted out.
469,00:30:24.12,00:30:24.12,Your work here is donefor your voting.
470,00:30:26.79,00:30:26.79,We'll now bring in the Ulongtribe.
471,00:30:28.33,00:30:28.33,You can then partakein your reward.
472,00:30:31.21,00:30:31.21,Grab your torches.Cross over to the jury side.
473,00:30:41.62,00:30:41.62,>> I surprised myself out hereby not being quite as strong
474,00:30:45.75,00:30:45.75,"as I expected to be.There are times I get crabby,"
475,00:30:48.62,00:30:48.62,and I know that can botherpeople.
476,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,But there has been many yearssince I've been in a situation
477,00:30:53.75,00:30:53.75,where I'm deprived of water and sleep.
478,00:30:56.38,00:30:56.38,I think the tribe as a wholeare good people by and large.
479,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe Ulong tribe...
480,00:31:13.83,00:31:13.83,who I'm sure is goingto enjoy this.

482,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,(all expressing awe)Biscuits! (singing)

486,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,>> It smells so good.>> Let's all wait to eat.
487,00:32:06.54,00:32:06.54,"Get excited, Tom.>> Oh, I am, I am."
488,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,>> Don't be bashful.Don't be bashful; I'm a skinny

490,00:32:13.46,00:32:13.46,like.(Ian chuckles)
491,00:32:16.00,00:32:16.00,">> Oh, my God.>> Yes!"
492,00:32:19.17,00:32:19.17,I think I'm going to cry.Are you all going to cry?
493,00:32:22.54,00:32:22.54,">> Oh, man.>> PROBST: Just so we're all"
494,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,"clear, part of Koror's rewardwas to be here for Tribal"
495,00:32:29.46,00:32:29.46,"Council tonight to listen in, potentially gather information"
496,00:32:33.17,00:32:33.17,that will help them laterin the game.
497,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,"They're not goingto be asking questions,"
498,00:32:36.88,00:32:36.88,just listening...and eating.
499,00:32:40.67,00:32:40.67,"First question I have is,it seems as though you brought"
500,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,"your entire camp.You brought shovels,"
501,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,"you brought your Home Depot kit.Why is that, Bobby Jon?"
502,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,">> I mean, we don't ever knowwhat's going to happen next."
503,00:32:53.96,00:32:53.96,We don't know if we're gonnamerge.
504,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,"We decided we'd bringeverything, and if we have to"
505,00:32:58.79,00:32:58.79,"take it back, then we'll take itback, but... I'm sure we've got"
506,00:33:00.79,00:33:00.79,"to take it back.>> PROBST: Yeah, we're not"
507,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,"merging.Angie, are you hiding your face"
508,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,because you can't standto look at the food?
509,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,>> Yeah.>> PROBST: You're genuinely
510,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,upset.Is it frustration?
511,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,Are you sad?Are you...?
512,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,>> I'm frustrated.I'm so frustrated.
513,00:33:23.00,00:33:23.00,"I mean, it wasreally close today."
514,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,We really... we needed this.And it's not just like today
515,00:33:29.50,00:33:29.50,"was a loss of food.It was a loss of, like, you"
516,00:33:33.17,00:33:33.17,know...winning today would have been
517,00:33:34.88,00:33:34.88,a real big boost to team morale.It's not all about the food.
518,00:33:38.88,00:33:38.88,"It's just that afterconsistently losing,"
519,00:33:40.38,00:33:40.38,"it would have been nice to win,and win something we all wanted."
520,00:33:45.75,00:33:45.75,">> PROBST: Stef, how is it foryou?"
521,00:33:47.92,00:33:47.92,>> It makes me sick.It makes me sick to know
522,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,that we would have beeneating a nice meal.
523,00:33:52.88,00:33:52.88,We almost had it inthe palm of our hands
524,00:33:55.33,00:33:55.33,except for one mistake.We had a great lead
525,00:33:57.38,00:33:57.38,and blew it all away.It's hard.
526,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,I can't even look over there.I don't even know
527,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,"who got voted out.>> PROBST: James, you guys have"
528,00:34:04.33,00:34:04.33,hung in there.You've tried to keep a good
529,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,attitude.Today looked like it put a knife
530,00:34:08.67,00:34:08.67,"in the back of this tribe.>> We wanted it, man."
531,00:34:13.38,00:34:13.38,Our desire was there.We was pulling as hard as we
532,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,could.As fast as we could just to get
533,00:34:19.42,00:34:19.42,this one reward.We all wanted it.
534,00:34:22.58,00:34:22.58,Ever since we've been starving.It was disappointing.
535,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,">> PROBST: Ibrehem?>> You know, everyone's really"
536,00:34:30.75,00:34:30.75,emotional right now.All they're thinking about
537,00:34:32.33,00:34:32.33,"is what's the last challenge.I mean, I can go back to other"
538,00:34:35.58,00:34:35.58,"challenges where other peoplehaven't done as well, but that's"
539,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,just not the way I do business.I guess I wish people would kind
540,00:34:41.62,00:34:41.62,of look collectively at howI've done in challenges.
541,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,Then put it togetherrather than just put your fate
542,00:34:47.62,00:34:47.62,"at one challenge, and if you've made one mistake, too bad."
543,00:34:50.33,00:34:50.33,"I mean, it seems likeall I've heard today is,"
544,00:34:53.75,00:34:53.75,"wow, we could have really beeneating that beef stew right now,"
545,00:34:56.42,00:34:56.42,"like that's the end of the game,like beef stew is it."
546,00:34:59.79,00:34:59.79,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time tovote."
547,00:35:02.29,00:35:02.29,"But before you vote, Ulong,Koror, you are going to vote."

554,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,"Janu, you're up.I'll go tally the votes."
555,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,"To be clear, these votesare for immunity."
556,00:36:19.58,00:36:19.58,Very rare in this gameyou want to see your name.
