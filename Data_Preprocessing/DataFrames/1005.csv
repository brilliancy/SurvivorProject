5,00:00:11.50,00:00:11.50,>> Tree mail. >> PROBST: The tribes had a big
6,00:00:14.33,00:00:14.33,"decision to make. >> ""Today you must choose one"
7,00:00:16.75,00:00:16.75,"tribal representative..."" >> I'll speak right out..."
8,00:00:19.33,00:00:19.33,">> PROBST: At Koror, Tom spoke for the tribe and chose Ian as"
9,00:00:22.58,00:00:22.58,"their representative. >> Ian, I say you go."
10,00:00:25.08,00:00:25.08,>> PROBST: But the decision exposed a divide in the tribe.
11,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,">> Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian and Tom are one unit."
12,00:00:33.08,00:00:33.08,So that makes five against four. We're definitely the underdogs
13,00:00:35.67,00:00:35.67,here. >> Maybe we'll draw straws or
14,00:00:37.46,00:00:37.46,"something. >> PROBST: At Ulong, the tribe"
15,00:00:39.29,00:00:39.29,"couldn't make a decision. You guys don't have a leader,"
16,00:00:41.29,00:00:41.29,you can't even pick a representative.
17,00:00:43.29,00:00:43.29,Give me somebody. >> James.
18,00:00:45.12,00:00:45.12,>> James. >> James.
19,00:00:46.71,00:00:46.71,">> I wasn't trying to be the leader, they picked me."
20,00:00:48.75,00:00:48.75,>> PROBST: The tribes competed in a bathroom build-off.
21,00:00:51.96,00:00:51.96,We're going to judge your bathroom.
22,00:00:54.04,00:00:54.04,"For the winning tribe, our entire construction department"
23,00:00:56.79,00:00:56.79,will build a shelter. Both tribes squared off.
24,00:01:05.71,00:01:05.71,">> Jenn, is that a boat coming? >> PROBST: And in the end, it"
25,00:01:08.71,00:01:08.71,was Koror that won the new shelter.
26,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,">> Oh, it's a frickin' palace. It's like the Taj Mahal."
27,00:01:14.25,00:01:14.25,It's fantastic. >> PROBST: At the immunity
28,00:01:16.25,00:01:16.25,"challenge, Ulong was out for revenge."
29,00:01:20.04,00:01:20.04,>> We're not going back to Tribal Council!

31,00:01:24.21,00:01:24.21,Jenn is in! Steph wins.
32,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33,...but the men faltered. Koror wins their fourth straight
33,00:01:31.25,00:01:31.25,immunity challenge. Back at Ulong...
34,00:01:35.79,00:01:35.79,>> I have never lost this bad. >> PROBST: ...the girls were
35,00:01:38.46,00:01:38.46,frustrated and wanted James out. >> James lost it for all of us.
36,00:01:41.79,00:01:41.79,>> PROBST: But Kim was on the chopping block as well.
37,00:01:44.17,00:01:44.17,>> She sits on her butt. She might drink some coconut
38,00:01:47.62,00:01:47.62,"juice, you know. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
39,00:01:51.21,00:01:51.21,the women ultimately sided with the men...
40,00:01:53.21,00:01:53.21,Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Palau...
41,00:01:55.21,00:01:55.21,...and voted out the weakest link.
42,00:01:58.25,00:01:58.25,14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

44,00:03:26.38,00:03:26.38,>> Your shoulder's right on my head.
45,00:03:28.42,00:03:28.42,(laughing) (giggling)
46,00:03:38.00,00:03:38.00,(giggling) >> Don't do that to yourself.
47,00:03:42.92,00:03:42.92,(giggling) (giggling)
48,00:03:49.08,00:03:49.08,">> In the shelter, people have teamed off, and Jennifer and"
49,00:03:52.00,00:03:52.00,Gregg have definitely teamed off.
50,00:03:54.25,00:03:54.25,"I mean, Jennifer had her hand on Gregg's stomach, rubbing on"
51,00:03:57.21,00:03:57.21,"it. I mean, it's very obvious."
52,00:03:59.08,00:03:59.08,And they won't admit how close they're getting.
53,00:04:01.08,00:04:01.08,But we can all see it. They got to think we're stupid
54,00:04:05.04,00:04:05.04,if we can't tell that they're together.
55,00:04:07.83,00:04:07.83,>> Willard's in the hammock. >> Willard...!
56,00:04:11.54,00:04:11.54,Where are you? >> Nice.
57,00:04:14.83,00:04:14.83,>> Can you see the fire? You're in charge.
58,00:04:22.58,00:04:22.58,Willard... You're in charge of the fire
59,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,unless you wake somebody up. >> Y'all ready?
60,00:04:40.96,00:04:40.96,">> Hold up, hold up. >> I don't know that we need the"
61,00:04:42.96,00:04:42.96,machete. >> We don't need it.
62,00:04:44.83,00:04:44.83,>> I've got the bag. >> You might need it for
63,00:04:46.88,00:04:46.88,something. (thunder)
64,00:04:48.71,00:04:48.71,>> Everybody in line now. Let's go.
65,00:04:51.08,00:04:51.08,">> We get back from Tribal Council, and it's James and"
66,00:04:53.46,00:04:53.46,Bobby Jon's idea to go find the cave because it's going to rain.
67,00:04:56.50,00:04:56.50,>> A tree sticking out. >> Yeah.
68,00:04:58.04,00:04:58.04,">> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's really bad."
69,00:05:01.25,00:05:01.25,>> Where the hell are we going? >> Trying to get to the cave.
70,00:05:04.88,00:05:04.88,>> This is the wrong way. >> The cave is 300 yards from
71,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,the shelter. I was the one trying to lead us
72,00:05:12.04,00:05:12.04,through there. And I've never really been real
73,00:05:14.75,00:05:14.75,"lost before in the wilderness, especially at night."
74,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,"Here's the trail, dude. >> You on the trail?"
75,00:05:20.00,00:05:20.00,">> Oh, yeah. >> That's not the trail."
76,00:05:22.33,00:05:22.33,">> Y'all, watch out. >> There's a wall in front of"
77,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17,"us, right? See this here, that's a rock."
78,00:05:29.08,00:05:29.08,>> That's a wall. >> I think we're totally lost.
79,00:05:31.08,00:05:31.08,">> Come on y'all, this is an adventure."
80,00:05:33.04,00:05:33.04,>> I just don't want anybody to get hurt. We're already...
81,00:05:35.08,00:05:35.08,>> Ain't nobody gonna get hurt. (thunder)
82,00:05:38.04,00:05:38.04,It's gonna be a tree up here. >> Where are we going?
83,00:05:40.42,00:05:40.42,">> Come on, you have a  better way to get back there?"
84,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,I can't see. Can you see? >> No.
85,00:05:44.92,00:05:44.92,">> Well, I'm trying, baby. But don't get on down my throat,"
86,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,'cause I don't know what's going on either.
87,00:05:48.62,00:05:48.62,"I'm trying to stay dry, I'm trying to help out."
88,00:05:50.25,00:05:50.25,You know what I'm saying? >> Bobby Jon and James were gung
89,00:05:53.21,00:05:53.21,ho about it and I thought it was insane.
90,00:05:54.71,00:05:54.71,"It's the middle of the night, we can't find that cave."
91,00:05:56.75,00:05:56.75,"We're going around in circles for, like, an hour."
92,00:05:58.58,00:05:58.58,>> Are we supposed to keep bearing left?
93,00:06:00.21,00:06:00.21,>> I'm going back to camp. >> Why are you going to go back
94,00:06:02.42,00:06:02.42,to camp by yourself? >> You can't.
95,00:06:04.38,00:06:04.38,>> Why can't I? Who says I have to go with you
96,00:06:07.04,00:06:07.04,guys and get lost in the jungle? I don't want to get
97,00:06:09.92,00:06:09.92,lost in the jungle. >> Angie wanted to quit.
98,00:06:12.33,00:06:12.33,"She's one of those folks that says, ""I can't do this,"""
99,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,"you know, ""I'm never going to find it."""
100,00:06:17.88,00:06:17.88,"Okay, never say ""never."" (thunder)"
101,00:06:19.96,00:06:19.96,">> Oh, my God. >> We don't want to go back to"
102,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,get wet. >> I'm just scared to get
103,00:06:23.54,00:06:23.54,struck by lightning. We're in the middle of a
104,00:06:25.83,00:06:25.83,"freakin' jungle. This is, like, the last place"
105,00:06:28.00,00:06:28.00,they say to be. Let's just go back.
106,00:06:30.42,00:06:30.42,"Everybody walk that way, go. After about an hour in the dark,"
107,00:06:34.04,00:06:34.04,we were all tired. Our feet were killing us.
108,00:06:37.00,00:06:37.00,And we came back to our shelter and it poured all night.
109,00:06:39.88,00:06:39.88,(thunder) >> We cannot quit.
110,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,"We cannot falter. Y'all want to win, do not quit!"
111,00:06:47.33,00:06:47.33,>> Amen. >> A-Amen.
112,00:07:03.04,00:07:03.04,>> It's gray all the way back. There's more rain coming.
113,00:07:06.29,00:07:06.29,>> Feel like I slept in a mud hole.
114,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,>> I'm just feeling really miserable this morning.
115,00:07:17.58,00:07:17.58,No sleep. We're all freezing.
116,00:07:20.17,00:07:20.17,It's miserable. Today doesn't look like it's
117,00:07:24.92,00:07:24.92,going to be shaping up too well. It's pretty dark and stormy
118,00:07:28.33,00:07:28.33,looking. This is a rough one.
119,00:07:50.17,00:07:50.17,>> It was a tough night. It was a little grumpy
120,00:07:52.62,00:07:52.62,"this morning, you know. It comes from lack of sleep"
121,00:07:55.00,00:07:55.00,and you being the guy up tending the fire all night.
122,00:07:57.54,00:07:57.54,"To make matters worse, I had to climb over Willard sleeping in"
123,00:08:00.38,00:08:00.38,the hammock each time I had to get up and tend the fire.
124,00:08:06.25,00:08:06.25,"We made so many hints to Willard about, you know, we all"
125,00:08:08.88,00:08:08.88,have to help with the fire. Either he's playing a game
126,00:08:11.46,00:08:11.46,"where he's wearing me down by making me stay up all night,"
127,00:08:15.21,00:08:15.21,"or he's just got the kind of attitude where, ""Why should I do"
128,00:08:18.75,00:08:18.75,"it if somebody else is going to do it for me?"""
129,00:08:21.42,00:08:21.42,"You know, I mean, because of his age, he can't contribute a lot."
130,00:08:25.12,00:08:25.12,But he can come out here and put another log on the fire.
131,00:08:28.58,00:08:28.58,>> He's had plenty of time and energy to think about what
132,00:08:31.67,00:08:31.67,"his role is in this game, and the longer you keep him"
133,00:08:34.71,00:08:34.71,"around, the more likely he is to screw you."
134,00:08:37.21,00:08:37.21,>> Right. It's discouraging.
135,00:08:38.71,00:08:38.71,>> What an ass. >> Imagine putting up with that
136,00:08:41.42,00:08:41.42,"in the real world? >> Oh, God."
137,00:08:43.04,00:08:43.04,">> I mean, it's just, like... You have to bite your tongue"
138,00:08:45.88,00:08:45.88,"here and just keep playing the game, and it just infuriates"
139,00:08:48.21,00:08:48.21,you. You just want to unload on the
140,00:08:49.92,00:08:49.92,"guy. You know, tell him where he"
141,00:08:51.71,00:08:51.71,belongs. >> Since we keep winning
142,00:08:54.00,00:08:54.00,"immunity, you don't really have to play, you know, the voting,"
143,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83,"the alliance part of the game. Everyone's sitting pretty,"
144,00:09:00.04,00:09:00.04,we keep winning. Koror keeps getting stronger.
145,00:09:04.00,00:09:04.00,"So in a way, because we've been winning all these immunity"
146,00:09:06.50,00:09:06.50,"challenges, Willard has been getting a free ride."
147,00:09:08.79,00:09:08.79,And he's been able to play this game a lot longer
148,00:09:11.29,00:09:11.29,"than he should. >> PROBST: Welcome, guys."
149,00:09:21.04,00:09:21.04,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
150,00:09:22.62,00:09:22.62,Here's how it's going to work. Both tribes are going to race
151,00:09:26.67,00:09:26.67,out to a Japanese shipwreck to retrieve sake bottles
152,00:09:29.46,00:09:29.46,"from the bottom of the ocean. Using a pulley system,"
153,00:09:32.58,00:09:32.58,each tribe will pull one tribe member out to a buoy.
154,00:09:35.21,00:09:35.21,Directly underneath the buoy is a shipwreck.
155,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,Scattered amongst the shipwreck are 14 sake bottles.
156,00:09:42.04,00:09:42.04,"When you hit the buoy, a tribe member will dive down,"
157,00:09:44.96,00:09:44.96,"release the sake bottle, come back up, get back on the skiff"
158,00:09:48.42,00:09:48.42,and their tribe will pull them back to the start where another
159,00:09:51.17,00:09:51.17,tribe member will get on and do the same thing.
160,00:09:53.38,00:09:53.38,The first tribe to collect six sake bottles wins reward.
161,00:09:57.42,00:09:57.42,Want to know what you're playing for?
162,00:09:59.42,00:09:59.42,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Good news is the
163,00:10:02.08,00:10:02.08,winning tribe will eat tonight. >> Oh...
164,00:10:06.21,00:10:06.21,">> PROBST: Now, for bad the news."
165,00:10:08.04,00:10:08.04,"You'll be dining at Tribal Council, because win or lose,"
166,00:10:13.17,00:10:13.17,"both tribes are going to Tribal Council tonight, both tribes"
167,00:10:16.42,00:10:16.42,will vote one tribe member out. The winning tribe will go
168,00:10:21.08,00:10:21.08,to Tribal Council and vote somebody out.
169,00:10:22.33,00:10:22.33,"They will then cross to the jury side,"
170,00:10:24.58,00:10:24.58,help themselves to some stew and root beer and listen in
171,00:10:28.71,00:10:28.71,as the losing tribe has their Tribal Council.
172,00:10:31.62,00:10:31.62,"In a game in which knowledge is power, the winning tribe will"
173,00:10:35.08,00:10:35.08,leave Tribal Council with a full belly and some potentially
174,00:10:38.67,00:10:38.67,vital information to help them later in the game.
175,00:10:41.50,00:10:41.50,"Everybody clear on this? Koror, you have"
176,00:10:44.08,00:10:44.08,four extra members. You're sitting four people out.
177,00:10:46.42,00:10:46.42,"Who is it going to be? >> Willard, Caryn, Katie and"
178,00:10:49.17,00:10:49.17,"Janu are sitting out. >> PROBST: All right, those four"
179,00:10:52.17,00:10:52.17,"take a spot in the boat, everybody else, wait for my go."
180,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,"For reward, survivors ready? Go!"
181,00:11:05.04,00:11:05.04,Steph and Jen first on the skiffs.
182,00:11:12.83,00:11:12.83,"Ulong with a bit of a lead. Steph first to the buoy,"
183,00:11:17.50,00:11:17.50,and she's down. Jen right behind her.
184,00:11:30.83,00:11:30.83,"Jen first up, with a bottle for Koror."
185,00:11:33.04,00:11:33.04,">> Come on, let's go! >> PROBST: Steph up with a"
186,00:11:36.50,00:11:36.50,bottle for Ulong right behind. Koror back first.
187,00:11:44.29,00:11:44.29,Ulong right behind. We're dead even.
188,00:11:47.17,00:11:47.17,">> Go, Gregg. >> Let's go."
189,00:11:49.33,00:11:49.33,>> PROBST: Gregg and Angie heading out.
190,00:11:53.92,00:11:53.92,Angie first there for Ulong. Gregg right behind.
191,00:12:03.12,00:12:03.12,Angie up. Gregg up.
192,00:12:04.83,00:12:04.83,Both heading back. We're still dead even.
193,00:12:07.88,00:12:07.88,First tribe to six is going to be eating tonight.
194,00:12:10.46,00:12:10.46,Ulong back first. Ibrehem on the skiff.
195,00:12:14.00,00:12:14.00,Ulong with a bit of a lead now. Koror losing time.
196,00:12:18.08,00:12:18.08,Gregg working against them. There it is.
197,00:12:21.58,00:12:21.58,"Gregg's back. We're tied, two-two, Koror"
198,00:12:25.29,00:12:25.29,really falling behind. Ibrehem down.
199,00:12:35.33,00:12:35.33,Koror really slowing down. Ibrehem comes up.
200,00:12:45.12,00:12:45.12,>> Got one? >> PROBST: He doesn't have a
201,00:12:47.04,00:12:47.04,"bottle, he's got to go back down."
202,00:12:49.04,00:12:49.04,"Coby going down for Koror. >> Come on, Ib, come up with"
203,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,one. Come on!
204,00:12:58.79,00:12:58.79,>> PROBST: He comes up. Still doesn't have a bottle.
205,00:13:01.25,00:13:01.25,Coby has one. He's heading back for Koror.
206,00:13:04.79,00:13:04.79,Koror's made up a lot of time. They're now in the lead.
207,00:13:06.96,00:13:06.96,">> Come on, Ib! Oh, my God."
208,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,>> PROBST: Ibrehem going down one more time.
209,00:13:16.04,00:13:16.04,>> Got one? >> Get on the raft!
210,00:13:18.46,00:13:18.46,>> Get on the raft! >> Get on!
211,00:13:20.21,00:13:20.21,>> Get on the raft. >> Get on the plank!
212,00:13:22.21,00:13:22.21,">> PROBST: Ibrehem does not have a sake bottle, and he's coming "
213,00:13:24.21,00:13:24.21,back. That is going to hurt Ulong.
214,00:13:27.04,00:13:27.04,Koror back with their third. Koror leads three-two.
215,00:13:31.12,00:13:31.12,(teams shouting encouragement) Ibrehem comes back without a
216,00:13:38.08,00:13:38.08,bottle. One full bottle behind.
217,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83,">> Way to go, team. >> PROBST: Tom is down for"
218,00:13:48.12,00:13:48.12,Koror. Tom up with a bottle for Koror.
219,00:13:57.08,00:13:57.08,Bobby Jon down for Ulong. Bobby Jon is up quickly with a
220,00:14:04.54,00:14:04.54,bottle. Ulong's going to have to dig
221,00:14:06.42,00:14:06.42,"deep. >> All right, guys!"
222,00:14:09.38,00:14:09.38,>> PROBST: Tom back with the fourth bottle for Koror.
223,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,They lead four-two. >> Beautiful.
224,00:14:15.83,00:14:15.83,>> PROBST: Ian heading into the water.
225,00:14:17.67,00:14:17.67,Bobby Jon back. Ulong now at three.

227,00:14:23.46,00:14:23.46,miracle. Koror leads four-three.
228,00:14:25.50,00:14:25.50,Ian goes down for Koror. James is in for Ulong.
229,00:14:41.96,00:14:41.96,James is up first. Ian's having trouble.
230,00:14:46.67,00:14:46.67,>> I can't see any bottles. >> They're white! They're white!
231,00:14:50.88,00:14:50.88,>> PROBST: This is the break Ulong needed.
232,00:14:53.17,00:14:53.17,>> They're over to the right! >> PROBST: James is back.
233,00:14:57.33,00:14:57.33,We're tied at four-four. Ulong getting back in this.
234,00:15:11.92,00:15:11.92,Steph going down for Ulong. Ian up with a bottle for Koror.
235,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,Steph up very quickly with a bottle.
236,00:15:30.71,00:15:30.71,She's on the skiff and Ulong is pulling her back.
237,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,Ian back with their fifth bottle.
238,00:15:37.12,00:15:37.12,"Koror leads five-four, and Ian's going to go right back out."
239,00:15:40.12,00:15:40.12,Everybody's gone now. Anybody can go from here on out.
240,00:15:43.88,00:15:43.88,Steph heading back out. We're tied five-five.
241,00:15:45.96,00:15:45.96,"Ian holds the key for Koror. >> Come on, Ian!"
242,00:15:51.50,00:15:51.50,>> PROBST: Steph going down for Ulong.
243,00:15:56.79,00:15:56.79,Ian is up with Koror's sixth bottle.
244,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,All they've got to do is get him back now.
245,00:16:02.25,00:16:02.25,>> Come on! Tom!
246,00:16:06.50,00:16:06.50,>> PROBST: Ian coming back with the winning bottle.
247,00:16:14.21,00:16:14.21,Koror wins reward! (whooping)
248,00:16:24.08,00:16:24.08,>> All right! >> PROBST: Frustrated Steph.
249,00:16:28.92,00:16:28.92,Right. Here's how it's going to work
250,00:16:31.67,00:16:31.67,"tonight. Koror, you will go to Tribal"
251,00:16:33.58,00:16:33.58,"Council first, where you will vote somebody out of your tribe."
252,00:16:36.25,00:16:36.25,You will then move to the jury section and eat stew as you
253,00:16:39.54,00:16:39.54,listen in on Ulong's Tribal Council where they will vote
254,00:16:42.75,00:16:42.75,another member out of their tribe.
255,00:16:44.62,00:16:44.62,"Get in your outriggers, head back to camp."
256,00:17:07.00,00:17:07.00,"(cheering) Nice job again, everyone."
257,00:17:14.62,00:17:14.62,"(growling like pirates) >> Today was, was one we had to"
258,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,"win as a team, and we did, and unfortunately, both tribes have"
259,00:17:22.04,00:17:22.04,to vote one member out tonight. Poor Ulong is really getting
260,00:17:25.79,00:17:25.79,"decimated. I mean, there's gonna be four of"
261,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,them left and there'll be eight of us left.
262,00:17:29.79,00:17:29.79,It's just a good thing Ibrehem didn't do as well as he
263,00:17:32.17,00:17:32.17,should have. >> Doesn't matter. Even if he
264,00:17:34.17,00:17:34.17,"had gotten one, we would still  have been ahead of them."
265,00:17:36.17,00:17:36.17,>> The nice thing is we get to watch Ulong do it
266,00:17:38.29,00:17:38.29,"and see kind of, where the, where the, uh, the feelings are"
267,00:17:40.96,00:17:40.96,"and where the strategy is, and, I mean, tonight a party"
268,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,"in my mouth is gonna be had. Oh, God, I'm so excited."
269,00:17:46.88,00:17:46.88,I speak Kororese. >> Kororean.
270,00:17:50.25,00:17:50.25,>> Kororean. >> Can I make another
271,00:17:52.58,00:17:52.58,"suggestion, too? Tonight we're going to have"
272,00:17:54.17,00:17:54.17,to eat in front of them. Can we be nice about it and not
273,00:17:56.92,00:17:56.92,giggle and laugh and moan so much?
274,00:17:58.96,00:17:58.96,>> We're all 21. \xe2\x99\xaa I don't have
275,00:18:00.71,00:18:00.71,to go clamming today... \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa I don't have to go
276,00:18:04.12,00:18:04.12,play in the bay. \xe2\x99\xaa (people laughing)
277,00:18:07.17,00:18:07.17,>> Who brought this guy? Whose friend is he?
278,00:18:09.88,00:18:09.88,\xe2\x99\xaa Don't have to go and find seashells.
279,00:18:11.75,00:18:11.75,\xe2\x99\xaa Poor Ulong is in the Survivor hell. \xe2\x99\xaa
280,00:18:15.21,00:18:15.21,">> You're crazy. >> At the challenge, we had it"
281,00:18:26.46,00:18:26.46,in the bag. Then...
282,00:18:28.88,00:18:28.88,Ibrehem. We lost because of him.
283,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,He gave up. His heart wasn't in it.
284,00:18:37.04,00:18:37.04,"If his heart was in it, he would have told us, ""Look,"
285,00:18:40.83,00:18:40.83,"I can't do it,"" you know? That would have been the manly"
286,00:18:44.33,00:18:44.33,thing to do. >> I can't believe we've lost.
287,00:18:46.96,00:18:46.96,">> Beef stew, you know? >> I might throw up sitting"
288,00:18:50.25,00:18:50.25,"there watching them eat it, I really might."
289,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,">> Everything happens for a reason, though."
290,00:18:53.75,00:18:53.75,You got to think like that. >> It was such a joke.
291,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,>> Yeah. We gotta suffer. He's his-tor-y.
292,00:19:01.38,00:19:01.38,>> I've been an athlete my entire life.
293,00:19:04.12,00:19:04.12,"I'm just not a good loser. I just, I don't understand"
294,00:19:07.21,00:19:07.21,"how this tribe continues to lose the way it does, and I'm not"
295,00:19:11.08,00:19:11.08,"good with it, I'm not good with  losing."
296,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,I don't know how much more I can take of it.
297,00:19:14.12,00:19:14.12,I'm just hoping for a merge really.
298,00:19:16.12,00:19:16.12,I'm going to get water. >> Who's going for the craft?
299,00:19:22.12,00:19:22.12,I pretty much lost it for the whole team.
300,00:19:25.08,00:19:25.08,I guess I panicked a little bit and felt like I was taking too
301,00:19:27.67,00:19:27.67,much time. And that kind of threw it for
302,00:19:32.46,00:19:32.46,us. I single-handedly lost that one.
303,00:19:40.67,00:19:40.67,"I admit it. All the other challenges,"
304,00:19:43.42,00:19:43.42,"I gave my all. I never quit, but I definitely"
305,00:19:46.42,00:19:46.42,think I'm probably the number one target right now.
306,00:19:49.00,00:19:49.00,"If you can, let me know what's up."
307,00:19:50.62,00:19:50.62,>> I will. >> You know what I'm saying.
308,00:19:52.62,00:19:52.62,>> I will. >> Keep me informed.
309,00:19:54.12,00:19:54.12,"I know you've got my back. >> I got it, you know."
310,00:19:56.79,00:19:56.79,"It's just, boy, you know, the cookie crumbles."
311,00:19:58.88,00:19:58.88,You got that? >> Appreciate it.
312,00:20:01.38,00:20:01.38,">> As much as I do like him and, and as much as I've grown"
313,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,"to know him, it's fair to vote Ibrehem tonight."
314,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,">> I've said before, the first time we get to immunity,"
315,00:20:46.54,00:20:46.54,I very well may have a problem. And here we are.
316,00:20:50.21,00:20:50.21,There are situations that can't be turned around.
317,00:20:52.58,00:20:52.58,"It's like trying to fight gravity or King Canute saying,"
318,00:20:55.21,00:20:55.21,"""I want the tide to stop."" The tide ain't going to stop"
319,00:20:58.67,00:20:58.67,and gravity ain't going to shut off.
320,00:21:00.08,00:21:00.08,">> What's up, big boy? >> I just came by. Uh..."
321,00:21:03.25,00:21:03.25,"I think I'm going tonight. Do you, can you fit into my"
322,00:21:05.08,00:21:05.08,shorts? >> Oh... Willard.
323,00:21:09.42,00:21:09.42,Don't make me sad. Probably.
324,00:21:11.71,00:21:11.71,">> You know, it's a game, I had fun."
325,00:21:13.46,00:21:13.46,"I had bad moments, good moments."
326,00:21:15.25,00:21:15.25,I couldn't play as hard as I want because of physical
327,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,"reasons, but it's been okay. >> Just makes me so mad,"
328,00:21:21.12,00:21:21.12,if you go before Katie. She's so worthless.
329,00:21:23.50,00:21:23.50,"But what can we do? >> It's okay. It's, it's a "
330,00:21:25.50,00:21:25.50,"game of, of personalities, and I have almost no ability to"
331,00:21:27.50,00:21:27.50,"schmooze. I mean, I just don't have it."
332,00:21:31.04,00:21:31.04,"And you end up with my pants, there's something wrong with"
333,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,this game. >> And I get a shirt.
334,00:21:36.92,00:21:36.92,"I get a shirt back. >> Well, that's your shirt."
335,00:21:39.71,00:21:39.71,">> I could absolutely say with 100% certainty,"
336,00:21:41.71,00:21:41.71,"tonight will be Willard, and I don't have the numbers, I can't"
337,00:21:44.33,00:21:44.33,"change those other peoples' minds, it's not gonna happen."
338,00:21:46.96,00:21:46.96,"All it'll do is set me apart from the tribe,"
339,00:21:49.04,00:21:49.04,"and like I said, it's a popularity contest."
340,00:21:51.25,00:21:51.25,"If I act like a bitch, nobody's gonna like me."
341,00:21:53.25,00:21:53.25,I'm not going to stick around. >> Everybody's favorite
342,00:21:55.21,00:21:55.21,"curmudgeon. >> ""Curmudgeon,"" that's a good"
343,00:21:58.33,00:21:58.33,"word. >> Yes, it is."
344,00:22:00.42,00:22:00.42,">> The only person pissing me off is Katie, but nobody'll do "
345,00:22:02.42,00:22:02.42,"anything about it. She doesn't do anything, and"
346,00:22:05.33,00:22:05.33,she's still here. I don't even care how far I get
347,00:22:08.04,00:22:08.04,"in the game, but if Katie gets further than me, I will"
348,00:22:10.21,00:22:10.21,"just puke, puke, puke. You want to walk?"
349,00:22:26.12,00:22:26.12,">> Yeah, I'm cool. You want to walk?"
350,00:22:27.83,00:22:27.83,Which way? That way? >> Sure. Don't...
351,00:22:30.50,00:22:30.50,don't tell anybody this. >> I won't.
352,00:22:32.00,00:22:32.00,">> Because I trust you, and we've built a relationship."
353,00:22:35.17,00:22:35.17,And I think what's good about this is it's an equal benefit
354,00:22:38.42,00:22:38.42,for both you and me. >> I agree.
355,00:22:40.21,00:22:40.21,">> Right now, there's, like, a soft alliance between me, Tom..."
356,00:22:43.46,00:22:43.46,">> Ian, Katie... >> Um... Ian, Katie and Jenn."
357,00:22:46.58,00:22:46.58,>> Right. >> And Tom and Ian are really 
358,00:22:48.92,00:22:48.92,"just strong, and that bond is just too tight, you know?"
359,00:22:54.46,00:22:54.46,Jenn and I feel like we're on the outside of that alliance.
360,00:22:57.79,00:22:57.79,">> Right. >> And we feel, like, once"
361,00:23:00.08,00:23:00.08,"Willard and Caryn are gone, if it comes to seven people,"
362,00:23:03.38,00:23:03.38,"then we switch-- me, Jenn, you and Janu."
363,00:23:09.04,00:23:09.04,And then we start picking them off.
364,00:23:11.88,00:23:11.88,>> The main interesting thing that happened today...
365,00:23:15.92,00:23:15.92,"was with Ken and Barbie. Gregg basically told me,"
366,00:23:19.29,00:23:19.29,"secretly-- and not to tell anybody, and I won't-- that him"
367,00:23:23.04,00:23:23.04,and Jennifer want to make a secret alliance to the top four
368,00:23:27.12,00:23:27.12,with me and Janu. And they want to pick everybody
369,00:23:29.83,00:23:29.83,"else off, including Tom and Ian. >> Tom especially?"
370,00:23:33.67,00:23:33.67,>> Tom especially. >> Tom's my biggest
371,00:23:35.83,00:23:35.83,bull's-eye right now. I want Tom off.
372,00:23:37.96,00:23:37.96,>> Mm-hmm. >> What?
373,00:23:40.25,00:23:40.25,Out of the blue! >> I... I'm in a good situation
374,00:23:43.08,00:23:43.08,because I can be part of that five-person alliance
375,00:23:45.12,00:23:45.12,and get information from them and control them.
376,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,>> The game is now just now getting interesting
377,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,now that we're having to vote people off.
378,00:23:50.79,00:23:50.79,I'm very excited. I love that the game is going to
379,00:23:53.46,00:23:53.46,a new level. I can't wait.
380,00:24:02.25,00:24:02.25,">> So we're good? Everything's cool, right?"
381,00:24:04.00,00:24:04.00,>> Yep. We got the plan. >> Right.
382,00:24:07.08,00:24:07.08,">> And I think, you know... >> Right."
383,00:24:08.96,00:24:08.96,">> Willard seems to have a good attitude about it, too."
384,00:24:12.46,00:24:12.46,">> Right. Nobody wants to go home,"
385,00:24:14.96,00:24:14.96,"but you got to do it with a stiff upper lip also,"
386,00:24:17.29,00:24:17.29,as most of us will at one time or another.
387,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,>> So Jenn and I are in the middle to navigate which way
388,00:24:23.79,00:24:23.79,"we really want to go, and that's a luxury."
389,00:24:30.79,00:24:30.79,"If we wanted to, we could flip from the Katie, Tom and Ian"
390,00:24:34.17,00:24:34.17,side to the Janu and Coby side. And we could start picking off
391,00:24:38.17,00:24:38.17,who I perceive to be the bigger strengths in Tom and Ian.
392,00:24:43.00,00:24:43.00,"Jenn and I-- people look at us as, oh, we're"
393,00:24:46.12,00:24:46.12,"just, like, a cute couple. Well, I think we're thinking"
394,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,a hell of a lot more than them. >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
395,00:25:15.00,00:25:15.00,"a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch,"
396,00:25:18.38,00:25:18.38,and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire.
397,00:25:21.25,00:25:21.25,This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council.
398,00:25:23.46,00:25:23.46,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
399,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
400,00:25:28.67,00:25:28.67,That will be the case for one of you tonight.
401,00:25:32.96,00:25:32.96,"So we have a lot to cover. Let's talk about relationships,"
402,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,"leadership, friendship. Katie, who's leading this tribe"
403,00:25:43.62,00:25:43.62,right now? >> Depends how you want to
404,00:25:46.71,00:25:46.71,"define ""leader."" At challenges, Tom definitely"
405,00:25:48.42,00:25:48.42,is a leader. If you're looking at leader as
406,00:25:52.29,00:25:52.29,"someone that provides food, that's Ian."
407,00:25:54.38,00:25:54.38,">> PROBST: Tom, did you come in here to be the leader?"
408,00:25:56.54,00:25:56.54,">> My intention was to come in here, be the 40-year-old dad,"
409,00:25:59.58,00:25:59.58,fade into the background. I ended up in a tribe
410,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,initially physically weaker than the other tribe.
411,00:26:06.54,00:26:06.54,And every one of us had to turn it on 110% to win those
412,00:26:10.25,00:26:10.25,immunities. And we see the results.
413,00:26:14.25,00:26:14.25,">> PROBST: Coby, are you social with this tribe?"
414,00:26:17.50,00:26:17.50,>> I'm very social... which could bite me in the end.
415,00:26:20.71,00:26:20.71,"I get along with everybody. You know, when you're too"
416,00:26:23.54,00:26:23.54,"friendly, and you're too busy of a bee, people watch you too"
417,00:26:25.54,00:26:25.54,"much, I guess. >> PROBST: So what do you do"
418,00:26:30.04,00:26:30.04,to... to counter that? >> I don't care.
419,00:26:31.54,00:26:31.54,I'm just being me. I am social.
420,00:26:33.92,00:26:33.92,I am a butterfly. I do want to talk to everybody.
421,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,"So I just do it, and if that costs me the game"
422,00:26:38.25,00:26:38.25,"in the end, well, so be it. >> PROBST: Gregg, what"
423,00:26:40.58,00:26:40.58,friendships have you seen develop?
424,00:26:44.00,00:26:44.00,Are you starting to notice just a natural
425,00:26:46.12,00:26:46.12,bonding between people? >> You definitely see that.
426,00:26:49.42,00:26:49.42,Tom and Ian spend a lot of time together.
427,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,"You know, it's like a father-son relationship."
428,00:26:53.38,00:26:53.38,">> I'm the father. >> But, at the same time, we all"
429,00:26:56.75,00:26:56.75,"appreciate that, you know? It's not something that's hidden"
430,00:26:59.21,00:26:59.21,or secretive. Coby and Janu have been getting
431,00:27:01.79,00:27:01.79,along great. And Willard and Caryn have
432,00:27:04.33,00:27:04.33,been getting along great. Katie's been spreading the
433,00:27:06.62,00:27:06.62,"wealth. She's been, you know, loving"
434,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,"everyone, and everyone's enjoying her company."
435,00:27:11.12,00:27:11.12,>> Thanks. >> Where does that leave Jenn
436,00:27:13.33,00:27:13.33,"and Gregg? >> So, you know, that leaves me"
437,00:27:15.92,00:27:15.92,and Jenn alone. >> PROBST: So that's a different
438,00:27:18.21,00:27:18.21,"type of friendship then? >> We have a strong bond, just"
439,00:27:22.04,00:27:22.04,"as everyone else here, and it's nothing you know, super"
440,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,"intense at this point. >> PROBST: Willard, how do you"
441,00:27:28.08,00:27:28.08,think you are perceived? Probably as one of the weaker
442,00:27:30.79,00:27:30.79,players on the team. I'm not as strong as I thought
443,00:27:34.58,00:27:34.58,I'd be. And I think people
444,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,understand that. Not a good position to be in.
445,00:27:40.29,00:27:40.29,">> PROBST: Gregg, at this point, how big an issue does trust"
446,00:27:43.08,00:27:43.08,become? >> It's about to kick in.
447,00:27:44.83,00:27:44.83,"It's about to really kick in. This is our first time here,"
448,00:27:48.62,00:27:48.62,"and now we're faced with the reality of voting people off,"
449,00:27:52.17,00:27:52.17,and so the trust that we think that we have or hope that we
450,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,have is going to be tested because it hasn't been tested
451,00:27:59.04,00:27:59.04,"yet. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
452,00:28:01.04,00:28:01.04,"vote. Willard, you're up."
453,00:28:25.25,00:28:25.25,>> You're crabby and you're bitter.
454,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,Bye. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
455,00:28:54.12,00:28:54.12,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
456,00:29:07.46,00:29:07.46,the decision is final-- person voted out
457,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
458,00:29:11.04,00:29:11.04,I'll read the votes. First vote...
459,00:29:16.29,00:29:16.29,"Katie. Willard-- one vote Katie,"
460,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,"one vote Willard. Willard-- two votes Willard,"
461,00:29:30.08,00:29:30.08,one vote Katie. Willard-- that's three votes
462,00:29:35.54,00:29:35.54,Willard. Willard-- four votes Willard.
463,00:29:43.12,00:29:43.12,One vote Katie. Fifth person voted
464,00:29:46.33,00:29:46.33,"out of Survivor: Palau, Willard."
465,00:29:49.12,00:29:49.12,"That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
466,00:29:59.96,00:29:59.96,"Willard, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
467,00:30:05.96,00:30:05.96,">> Stay strong, stick to the plan, finish them off."
468,00:30:09.08,00:30:09.08,"(several saying farewells) >> PROBST: Okay, Koror, you are"
469,00:30:21.67,00:30:21.67,now a tribe of eight. Willard voted out.
470,00:30:24.12,00:30:24.12,Your work here is done for your voting.
471,00:30:26.79,00:30:26.79,We'll now bring in the Ulong tribe.
472,00:30:28.33,00:30:28.33,You can then partake in your reward.
473,00:30:31.21,00:30:31.21,Grab your torches. Cross over to the jury side.
474,00:30:41.62,00:30:41.62,>> I surprised myself out here by not being quite as strong
475,00:30:45.75,00:30:45.75,"as I expected to be. There are times I get crabby,"
476,00:30:48.62,00:30:48.62,and I know that can bother people.
477,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,But there has been many years since I've been in a situation
478,00:30:53.75,00:30:53.75,where I'm deprived of water and  sleep.
479,00:30:56.38,00:30:56.38,I think the tribe as a whole are good people by and large.
480,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the Ulong tribe...
481,00:31:13.83,00:31:13.83,who I'm sure is going to enjoy this.
482,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,"Koror, go ahead and pull off the cover."
483,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,(all expressing awe) Biscuits! (singing)
484,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,">> PROBST: Stew, bread, and root beer."
485,00:31:44.79,00:31:44.79,"(all expressing awe) >> Oh, it smells so delicious."
486,00:31:48.29,00:31:48.29,">> Oh, my God. >> Pass it out."
487,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,>> It smells so good. >> Let's all wait to eat.
488,00:32:06.54,00:32:06.54,"Get excited, Tom. >> Oh, I am, I am."
489,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,>> Don't be bashful. Don't be bashful; I'm a skinny
490,00:32:11.75,00:32:11.75,"man. >> We get two a piece, it looks"
491,00:32:13.46,00:32:13.46,like. (Ian chuckles)
492,00:32:16.00,00:32:16.00,">> Oh, my God. >> Yes!"
493,00:32:19.17,00:32:19.17,I think I'm going to cry. Are you all going to cry?
494,00:32:22.54,00:32:22.54,">> Oh, man. >> PROBST: Just so we're all"
495,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,"clear, part of Koror's reward was to be here for Tribal"
496,00:32:29.46,00:32:29.46,"Council tonight to listen in,  potentially gather information"
497,00:32:33.17,00:32:33.17,that will help them later in the game.
498,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,"They're not going to be asking questions,"
499,00:32:36.88,00:32:36.88,just listening... and eating.
500,00:32:40.67,00:32:40.67,"First question I have is, it seems as though you brought"
501,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,"your entire camp. You brought shovels,"
502,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,"you brought your Home Depot kit. Why is that, Bobby Jon?"
503,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,">> I mean, we don't ever know what's going to happen next."
504,00:32:53.96,00:32:53.96,We don't know if we're gonna merge.
505,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,"We decided we'd bring everything, and if we have to"
506,00:32:58.79,00:32:58.79,"take it back, then we'll take it back, but... I'm sure we've got"
507,00:33:00.79,00:33:00.79,"to take it back. >> PROBST: Yeah, we're not"
508,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,"merging. Angie, are you hiding your face"
509,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,because you can't stand to look at the food?
510,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: You're genuinely
511,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,upset. Is it frustration?
512,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,Are you sad? Are you...?
513,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,>> I'm frustrated. I'm so frustrated.
514,00:33:23.00,00:33:23.00,"I mean, it was really close today."
515,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,We really... we needed this. And it's not just like today
516,00:33:29.50,00:33:29.50,"was a loss of food. It was a loss of, like, you"
517,00:33:33.17,00:33:33.17,know... winning today would have been
518,00:33:34.88,00:33:34.88,a real big boost to team morale. It's not all about the food.
519,00:33:38.88,00:33:38.88,"It's just that after consistently losing,"
520,00:33:40.38,00:33:40.38,"it would have been nice to win, and win something we all wanted."
521,00:33:45.75,00:33:45.75,">> PROBST: Stef, how is it for you?"
522,00:33:47.92,00:33:47.92,>> It makes me sick. It makes me sick to know
523,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,that we would have been eating a nice meal.
524,00:33:52.88,00:33:52.88,We almost had it in the palm of our hands
525,00:33:55.33,00:33:55.33,except for one mistake. We had a great lead
526,00:33:57.38,00:33:57.38,and blew it all away. It's hard.
527,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,I can't even look over there. I don't even know
528,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,"who got voted out. >> PROBST: James, you guys have"
529,00:34:04.33,00:34:04.33,hung in there. You've tried to keep a good
530,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,attitude. Today looked like it put a knife
531,00:34:08.67,00:34:08.67,"in the back of this tribe. >> We wanted it, man."
532,00:34:13.38,00:34:13.38,Our desire was there. We was pulling as hard as we
533,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,could. As fast as we could just to get
534,00:34:19.42,00:34:19.42,this one reward. We all wanted it.
535,00:34:22.58,00:34:22.58,Ever since we've been starving. It was disappointing.
536,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,">> PROBST: Ibrehem? >> You know, everyone's really"
537,00:34:30.75,00:34:30.75,emotional right now. All they're thinking about
538,00:34:32.33,00:34:32.33,"is what's the last challenge. I mean, I can go back to other"
539,00:34:35.58,00:34:35.58,"challenges where other people haven't done as well, but that's"
540,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,just not the way I do business. I guess I wish people would kind
541,00:34:41.62,00:34:41.62,of look collectively at how I've done in challenges.
542,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,Then put it together rather than just put your fate
543,00:34:47.62,00:34:47.62,"at one challenge, and if you've  made one mistake, too bad."
544,00:34:50.33,00:34:50.33,"I mean, it seems like all I've heard today is,"
545,00:34:53.75,00:34:53.75,"wow, we could have really been eating that beef stew right now,"
546,00:34:56.42,00:34:56.42,"like that's the end of the game, like beef stew is it."
547,00:34:59.79,00:34:59.79,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote."
548,00:35:02.29,00:35:02.29,"But before you vote, Ulong, Koror, you are going to vote."
549,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,"Last part of your reward is, you're going to vote to give"
550,00:35:10.58,00:35:10.58,immunity to one person from Ulong.
551,00:35:18.38,00:35:18.38,This is an individual decision.
552,00:35:20.12,00:35:20.12,And you are voting for the person you want to be safe
553,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,tonight at the vote. Whoever has the most votes
554,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,will get immunity on Ulong. Then Ulong will vote.
555,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,"Janu, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
556,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,"To be clear, these votes are for immunity."
557,00:36:19.58,00:36:19.58,Very rare in this game you want to see your name.
558,00:36:22.08,00:36:22.08,Tonight is one of those times. Person who has the most votes
559,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,will be immune from Tribal Council.
